1
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,150
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,430
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,390
Good morning.

4
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,470
I sound less dead inside because I actually woke up an hour before the stream was about to start.

5
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,810
Lately, I've been sleeping a lot earlier than I used to because I've been very unhealthy.

6
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,850
I don't know.

7
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,350
I think, honestly, I need to start being more healthy.

8
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,710
But, like, it's been a lot of stuff going on.

9
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,190
But... Because I couldn't... I couldn't stay up yesterday.

10
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,910
Um... I'm so proud... What?

11
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,270
Proud of me being unhealthy?

12
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,190
Like... Um... But, yes, uh...

13
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:40,330
I've been heading to bed a lot earlier than I'm used to, which is, like, before... either before midnight or, like, around 1 to 2, which is something I'm not used to.

14
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,350
I'm, you know, I'm sitting here, like, 1 to 2 is both healthier.

15
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,570
Like...

16
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,830
But you understand, sometimes I would get to bed a lot, lot later than 1 a.m.

17
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,750
Um...

18
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,130
But, um, I've been getting, like, I've been feeling, like, really, really tired lately.

19
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,550
Which I think is just me being, like, unhealthy in general.

20
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,390
Which means I gotta, you know, I gotta change my habits.

21
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,690
I guess that's not good.

22
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,290
Um...

23
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:08,610
I'll do...

24
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,250
Every time I say that, I'll be like, starting tomorrow, I shall change.

25
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,090
I shall be a better, healthier person.

26
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,170
Starting tomorrow!

27
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,950
But then, like, tomorrow never happens.

28
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,590
And I'd be like, you know, starting next week, I will start being more healthy.

29
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,330
Starting next week!

30
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,490
Ha ha ha ha!

31
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,570
Eventually, eventually, you know, I'll get there.

32
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,050
I'll start lying to myself until, like, it becomes the truth.

33
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,210
Ha ha ha!

34
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,150
That's how it goes, right, guys?

35
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,330
Ha ha ha!

36
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,210
Also, uh, Bluth, welcome to Tomato Farm!

37
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,010
Welcome, welcome!

38
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,490
I know today is gonna be, like, an incredible...

39
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,590
Today's stream will definitely be a lot more calmer, a lot more chiller than other streams.

40
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,950
Because a lot of stuff is happening today.

41
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,490
A lot of stuff has been happening the last couple of weeks.

42
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,250
Ha ha ha!

43
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,370
But, and I was thinking, like, oh...

44
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,690
I was debating whether or not, um...

45
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,190
I should move today's stream to a different day.

46
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,270
Or, like, you know, postpone Dynasty Warriors yet again.

47
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,890
Ha ha ha ha!

48
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,650
Due to, you know, obviously today is a big day.

49
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,010
Um, it's a big day.

50
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,690
And, uh, I figured, you know, a lot of stuff has been happening, you know.

51
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,970
I know there's some dragoons that, uh, just really want specifically to watch me.

52
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,750
And I decided to keep on streaming today because I was like, you know what?

53
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,450
You know, maybe there's some dragoons out there that's been feeling really down.

54
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,350
And need some comfort, need some company.

55
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,350
And I decided, um, today to...

56
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,390
To stream, to just, you know, I didn't postpone today's stream.

57
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:46,810
I was like, you know, I'll stream for the dragoons who might need some company today, who might need, you know, who might just really was looking forward to today's stream with me.

58
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:55,130
So I decided to keep on streaming today and, you know, keep those dragoons who need a new pick-me-up today to keep streaming.

59
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:07,370
And what a great pick-me-up it is that we're playing our favorite game, Dynasty Warriors, where you get to see, like, we together, we together, get to romanticize.

60
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,350
And some more Chinese generals.

61
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,870
What a great pick-me-up.

62
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,250
Our favorite dating sim simulator.

63
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,850
Yes, we.

64
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,510
This is a group effort.

65
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,830
We are romanticizing.

66
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,010
We are romanticizing Chinese generals together.

67
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,410
What happens to me happens to you, too.

68
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,370
This is a group collaboration with the dragoons.

69
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,410
Winter World, thank you for the super chat.

70
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,270
Thank you, thank you.

71
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,470
Also, give me a sec.

72
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,070
Let me message, do a work message real quick.

73
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,470
Also, okay, I'll say what.

74
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:02,810
It's basically, I'm just messaging the respawn staff to be like, what can I say and not say about the early access for the new season?

75
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,970
Like, I don't know.

76
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,630
They're like, oh, yeah, you can tweet it out.

77
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,890
I was like, okay, what can I?

78
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,010
I just need to be sure.

79
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,810
What can I not say?

80
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,170
Is there anything I'm not supposed to say?

81
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,770
Because it would be awkward.

82
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,250
And then they're like, oh, you're not supposed to say blah.

83
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,490
And I was like, what for it?

84
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,870
He said it on stream.

85
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:30,770
It's all right.

86
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,230
They don't watch my streams.

87
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,230
They don't watch the pre-talk part before I play.

88
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,770
Luke, thank you for the super chat.

89
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,150
Thank you.

90
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,870
Thank you.

91
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,530
I've just been catching up on Mario Monvide.

92
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,050
I've heard about the cost of dad surgery.

93
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,430
I know it's not much, but here's some money to offset the cost.

94
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,410
And best wishes to dad for his speedy recovery.

95
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,070
Thank you.

96
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,510
Thank you for the super chat.

97
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,710
I really appreciate it.

98
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,030
Oh, yeah.

99
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,490
I basically get like morning updates about dad.

100
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,390
Let me read today's text message from the babysitter.

101
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,890
I'm not going to be moving for a bit.

102
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,370
All right.

103
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,430
All right.

104
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,110
Here you go.

105
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:06,810
Good.

106
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,810
He's a bit more mobile when going to pee.

107
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,530
And otherwise, just chilling out.

108
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,910
Taking his meds, fine.

109
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,150
Just napping a bunch.

110
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,210
I'm trying to rehab a bit, but he doesn't like it.

111
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,350
Oh, and then he has like his little...

112
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,970
They sent me a picture of his baby gel.

113
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,850
He's like in.

114
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,750
Let me see.

115
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,530
I need to save this.

116
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:28,870
Okay.

117
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,070
I'll save...

118
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,610
I'm going to try to save the photo and let you guys see.

119
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,350
But he's in a little baby gel right now.

120
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,690
Uh, because obviously we don't want him to fucking...

121
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,050
Oh my God.

122
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,950
I actually saved the photo one, two, three, four, five, six...

123
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,550
I accidentally saved the photo seven fucking times.

124
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,230
Oops.

125
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,570
Because I was like, why won't it save?

126
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,850
And I kept pressing the button and I see the fucking photo saved seven times on my phone.

127
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,070
Um, all right.

128
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,210
Let me show you guys a picture.

129
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,210
Sorry, I'm not moving because I have to read the text.

130
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,010
All right.

131
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,530
This is his baby gel that he's currently trapped in.

132
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,050
Let me transform it to...

133
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,350
Fit to screen.

134
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,130
Okay, here we go.

135
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,770
All right.

136
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,530
So this is what the baby gel looks like.

137
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,970
He's currently in here.

138
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,990
He's in, he's in baby gel at the moment.

139
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,810
Um, Quantum, thank you for the five gift of chips.

140
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,190
Thank you.

141
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:24,890
Thank you.

142
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,190
Um, contained by his crimes of jumping too much.

143
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,490
All right.

144
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,710
I have him in this soft crate we have.

145
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,470
He will usually just nap most of the day.

146
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,770
He's going to be in trouble once he's feeling better.

147
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,430
He's already trying to go upstairs.

148
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,370
And I can see him wanting to jump up on things.

149
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,970
I think he just isn't because he's still hurt.

150
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,950
You're going to need a lot of those dog stares.

151
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,030
So far, I'm just blocking it all off so he can't.

152
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,670
I was like, why are you trying to jump?

153
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,330
Dad, why?

154
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,510
I was like, what do you mean?

155
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,670
He's looking, he's like, eyeing the stuff out.

156
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,270
He's like, yeah, I'm going to jump on you next.

157
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,510
He was born to jump.

158
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,650
It's literally not in his genes.

159
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,410
He is genetically bred to not jump.

160
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,750
He's trying to defy his biology.

161
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:40,430
No, I am not paying another $10,000 just so my dog can jump.

162
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,710
I am doing a hard time for his crimes.

163
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,650
And thank you for the super chat.

164
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,290
Thank you.

165
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,010
Thank you.

166
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,210
He has dreams, Doki.

167
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,750
He might have been born a wiener.

168
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,110
But he, his spirit is that of a golden retriever.

169
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,390
Let him, let him have his destiny.

170
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,750
Pouring the jump, forced to be a wiener dog.

171
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,770
But yes, he is unfortunately in prison right now.

172
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:24,410
He, he is, he is caged up for his crimes so that he will not jump.

173
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:33,110
Um, but yeah, that is the current, uh, current dad update.

174
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,470
Uh, what else do I have to talk about?

175
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:51,930
Uh, okay, uh, bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu And today,

176
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,810
I'll give you guys something exclusive for those who are here.

177
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,170
The preview for next membership wallpaper.

178
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,750
Sorry for the non-member goons.

179
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,150
Sorry.

180
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,150
Sorry for the non-member goons.

181
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,910
But this is going to be the outfit themed for...

182
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,630
I know, guys, I know I missed April.

183
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,110
But it's also because the artist needed more time for the wallpaper.

184
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,050
For those... Okay, for the member goons.

185
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,810
Um, I know I missed April.

186
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,390
But don't worry, you guys are getting two wallpapers.

187
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,230
Because also, the artist needed more time.

188
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,110
So, we're going to get two wallpapers in May.

189
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,350
Maybe three, I think.

190
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,670
Because I think I missed another one.

191
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,830
So, here is the outfit preview for...

192
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,510
This is usually the outfit preview.

193
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,190
So, like, you know, non-member goons will be able to see this as well.

194
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,650
When, um...

195
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,110
So, yeah.

196
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,670
This is...

197
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,590
It's going to be a coffee shop themed.

198
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,930
And, uh...

199
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,730
This is the outfit that's going to be for the coffee shop.

200
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,450
So, yay!

201
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,850
A little preview, guys.

202
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,250
Woo!

203
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,070
Yeah!

204
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,550
Woo!

205
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,850
All right.

206
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,350
All right.

207
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:01,930
Preview done.

208
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,530
Uh...

209
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:04,930
Yay!

210
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,850
Minimum wage token!

211
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,290
Yay!

212
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,310
Oh, man!

213
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,490
I sure do love minimum wage token!

214
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,050
That's so fucked up.

215
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,590
Let's see.

216
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,310
I'm going to...

217
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,330
I'm going to hear where Sirenia set the sound correctly.

218
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,350
Would she beat me up when I get copied?

219
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,330
Don't piss me off.

220
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,230
As long as you don't piss me off, guys.

221
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,410
Thank you for the super chat.

222
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:35,770
Thank you.

223
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,310
Thank you.

224
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,210
Heroic, thank you for the super chat.

225
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,690
Thank you.

226
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,450
Thank you.

227
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,110
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

228
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:42,410
Thank you.

229
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:42,810
Thank you.

230
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,830
Doing hard time for his crimes.

231
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,750
Champion, thank you for the super chat.

232
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,070
Thank you.

233
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:47,710
Thank you.

234
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,890
Dad will jump for beefy.

235
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,250
What?

236
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,770
Nice dad.

237
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,190
Okay.

238
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,030
All right.

239
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,630
Let me...

240
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,330
Let me boot up the game, guys.

241
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:56,850
Whoa!

242
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,510
Dynasty...

243
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:58,790
Oh, guys.

244
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,230
I need...

245
00:12:59,230 --> 00:12:59,910
What the fuck?

246
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,910
It's still getting updates?

247
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,470
What is it updating?

248
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,470
Additional features.

249
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:04,950
And...

250
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,290
Oh, and they just added photo mode.

251
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,090
Oh my god, we get photobode?

252
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,650
Wait, this is the best of... I was like, oh, wait.

253
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,150
And then it clicked in my head.

254
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,170
What that meant?

255
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,810
I was like, oh, they just added photobode.

256
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,390
Wait, photobode?

257
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,770
Alright, let's see.

258
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,970
Open the menu on the world map or the battle and press the touchpad button.

259
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,450
Okay.

260
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,670
I just need to get to the and press the touchpad button.

261
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,690
Okay, that's good.

262
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,510
That's good.

263
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,190
And the real dating sim.

264
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,250
Okay.

265
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,250
This is it.

266
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,750
This is what I... Finally, an update for me.

267
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:56,850
All I'm saying is that if I didn't prolong my Dynasty Warriors playthrough, I would have never got photobode.

268
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,050
So it was all planned.

269
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,150
I get photobode.

270
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,410
Alright, let's test it out.

271
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,230
Finally found myself a job.

272
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,050
It was all calculated.

273
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,950
I don't even remember.

274
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,170
Okay, wait.

275
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,010
I was on a horse?

276
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,230
How did I... Wait, I can be on the horse this entire... Oh, wait.

277
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:17,890
No, I can't.

278
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,530
I didn't realize... Wait, I can get off, though?

279
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,690
Oh my god.

280
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,310
Photomode can be entered with... And then...

281
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,310
Join the... In photomode, you can control and create... Oh my god.

282
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,170
Photomode... All right.

283
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:35,850
That's good.

284
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,010
All right.

285
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:37,610
That's good.

286
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,930
Now, I'm just... I needed to learn that in advance, guys.

287
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,570
All right.

288
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,610
Finally!

289
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,930
What I've been demanding for this entire time.

290
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,050
Hello, Jonfei.

291
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,430
Can't get... I mean... Hold on.

292
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,850
Thank you for the super chat.

293
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,350
Thank you.

294
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,990
Thank you.

295
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:55,830
All right.

296
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,710
What do you want?

297
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,130
Jonfei.

298
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,890
Oh my god.

299
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,390
Is this another... Already?

300
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,330
I just started the game.

301
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,310
How...

302
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,290
Am I ready on a dinner date?

303
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,510
How are we on a dinner date already with Jonfei?

304
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,990
Now we're great officers.

305
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,190
Getting audiences with royalty.

306
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,690
I don't know what it is about my brothers.

307
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,030
But the Emperor and Tao Tao seem to have taken a liking to them.

308
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,510
Thinking back on it now.

309
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,610
A lot has changed since our early days.

310
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,310
Look at us now, Jonfei.

311
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,110
We're hot.

312
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,030
We're rich.

313
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,350
The only thing that hasn't changed is me.

314
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,250
And...

315
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,810
And look at these guns.

316
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,170
No, you're perfect.

317
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,150
Being a drunk alcoholic is like what every woman wants in ancient China.

318
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,090
Or man.

319
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,770
Or man.

320
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,170
You know.

321
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,910
You don't...

322
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,910
We forgot to be left side dokey.

323
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,850
Okay, guys.

324
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,670
Give me a sec.

325
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,670
Give me a sec.

326
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,610
It's time to be left side dokey.

327
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,890
Wherever she is.

328
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:57,710
Oh my god.

329
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,030
Where is left side dokey?

330
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,810
Where...

331
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,370
Where is she?

332
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,490
Where did she go?

333
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,290
Okay.

334
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,190
That's not left side.

335
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,170
Where is left side dokey?

336
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,910
Anyway.

337
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,270
Guys, give me a sec.

338
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,410
I'm trying to find...

339
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:08,590
Nope.

340
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,750
That's center dokey.

341
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,470
Nope.

342
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,330
That's too...

343
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,050
A little to the right dokey.

344
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,030
Oh, there we go.

345
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,170
Left side dokey.

346
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,530
Okay.

347
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,030
Here we go.

348
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,750
So, these were my options.

349
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,490
You don't need to change.

350
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,230
And I'm...

351
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,670
That seems like the best option.

352
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,310
Well, isn't that nice to hear?

353
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,950
If you really think so...

354
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:29,830
That's right.

355
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,870
My brothers always seem to have their heads on straight.

356
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,430
They don't get mad.

357
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,670
No matter what.

358
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,610
And I lose my temper at the first sign of trouble.

359
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,570
Don't worry.

360
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,390
Some women like that.

361
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,470
That's the one thing that's never changed.

362
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,370
Speaking of changes...

363
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,730
You're quite different than you were when I first met.

364
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,550
That girl little Tali?

365
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,970
But your eyes is more and less in the same place.

366
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,650
I always feel at ease with you.

367
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,410
How do...

368
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,710
How do I...

369
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,890
How do I...

370
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,050
How do I...

371
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,690
Any different?

372
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,170
Whoa.

373
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,950
Oh, Fade of Black.

374
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,910
Oh, the classic.

375
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,150
Oh, wait.

376
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,030
It's night time.

377
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,590
Nothing has changed since Dong Zhuo's rule.

378
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,070
Wait.

379
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:08,750
Just what it's out.

380
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,310
It's out thinking.

381
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,410
Treating his majesty like this.

382
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,030
Well...

383
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,210
Wait.

384
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,310
This isn't my dating sim date.

385
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,030
He is the one who's in control of the court.

386
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,010
To him, the emperor is a mere puppet.

387
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,750
What is this?

388
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,810
Plot in my dating sim?

389
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,390
What is this?

390
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,170
I didn't ask for a lord.

391
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,790
His majesty would never fear a charlatan like him.

392
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,530
Well...

393
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,670
I am so glad our dear emperor is pained at all the tyrannical deeds committed in his name.

394
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,330
Perhaps we should have forgone Cao Cao and entrusted someone with more prestige.

395
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,770
Like Yuan Chao.

396
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,710
Oh, just because he has money.

397
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,490
But I hear that Liu Bei might also be worthy.

398
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,770
Oh, wait.

399
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,230
There's me.

400
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,370
Well met.

401
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,030
On patrol, I presume?

402
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,570
Oh, it has grown late.

403
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,870
Perhaps it would be wise to leave the patrols to the troops and rest.

404
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,810
Speaking of which, we shall do the same.

405
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,270
We bid you goodnight.

406
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,010
Wait.

407
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,830
So, like...

408
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,930
Where did I come from?

409
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,870
Did I come from...

410
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,130
Whose room did I leave from?

411
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,570
Who's room did I leave from, guys?

412
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,990
That's the...

413
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,450
That real question here.

414
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:39,050
I've just received word that Lord Gong Tsun Zan was defeated by Lord Yuan Shao at I Ching.

415
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,990
I owed a great deal to that man.

416
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,150
Lord Gong Tsun Zan took me under his wing when I was directionless.

417
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,510
He even nominated me as a minister of Ping Yuan.

418
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,670
This chaos...

419
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,370
Has claimed a dear friend.

420
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,710
Oh, no.

421
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,010
Why weren't you there to help him?

422
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,790
Do not lose heart.

423
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,450
What kind of friend are you?

424
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,770
You should have died for him.

425
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,950
It hasn't dampened my spirits as much as you might imagine.

426
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,170
Lord Gong Tsun Zan's defeat has given Lord Yuan Shao the four provinces north of the river.

427
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,550
Making his kingdom the most powerful in the land.

428
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,250
Wait, Yuan Shao's the most powerful now?

429
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,250
Lord Cao Cao will be unavoidable.

430
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,990
It's time.

431
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,990
History is being written.

432
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,530
Great changes are coming to our world.

433
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,070
And yet I'm not part of this history for some fucking reason.

434
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,730
You already rolled me out.

435
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,290
Has been replaced by strange excitement for the future.

436
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,190
I have something to discuss with you.

437
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,830
Tonight, let us enjoy drinks in the moonlight before feasting together in your room.

438
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,090
Wait, in my room?

439
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,230
Wait, wait, what?

440
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,250
In the moonlight in my room?

441
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,330
Fade to black.

442
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,030
I guess we'll never know what happened in my room.

443
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,970
I'm not sure of his majesty's true intentions.

444
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,890
But, he is clearly not satisfied with the current state of affairs.

445
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,310
So, what say the dream deal?

446
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,630
Three brothers sound better for three kingdoms.

447
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,030
It has better marketing than four brothers.

448
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:23,970
Yeah.

449
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,510
Helping all those in need.

450
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,290
That's what you set out to do.

451
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,440
I'm with you no matter what, brothers.

452
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,640
Four is an unlucky number, Doki.

453
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,060
We had to get rid of you.

454
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,680
Four means death.

455
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,100
Someone had to get cut.

456
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,460
If his majesty is asking for help, then I want to answer the call.

457
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,920
That's the Liu Bei we all know.

458
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,800
Besides, we never plan to just keep taking orders from Tao Tao forever, right?

459
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,180
I have no objections.

460
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,720
But, how are we going to carry out such a plan?

461
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,960
As it stands, we are nothing more than the guests of Lord Cao Cao's.

462
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,900
We don't have the soldiers, let alone the support necessary to succeed.

463
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,240
Don't worry.

464
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,380
I can 1v 100,000 of them.

465
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,120
First of all, Lord Cao Cao's influence and claim some land on which to establish a base.

466
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:42,760
Lord Cao Cao has been talking about attacking Yuan Shu in anticipation of Yuan Shao's forces coming south.

467
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,460
That will be our opportunity to leave Shu City.

468
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,000
Our destination is in Shu, the castle at Xiaopei.

469
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,620
With the time we've spent there, I'm sure...

470
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,420
Yeah, I'm the gorilla.

471
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,140
I'm the gorilla, guys.

472
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,600
One Doki.

473
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,300
Versus 100,000 Chinese generals.

474
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,160
I don't see why we need to keep following his orders.

475
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,320
I understand your thoughts.

476
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,720
But we cannot deny that he has helped us on many occasions.

477
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,860
Who will win?

478
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,780
I'd like to repay him.

479
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,320
Donkey Kong is here.

480
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,280
One can be...

481
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,060
I feel the same.

482
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,520
You know what?

483
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,880
Let's...

484
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,100
Fuck it.

485
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,420
Let's...

486
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,180
I feel the same.

487
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,820
That's good to hear.

488
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,720
Gotta make happy...

489
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
A happy general is a happy life.

490
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,780
It's just like you to think this way, brother.

491
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,820
Thank you, Kendra, for that raid.

492
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,180
That's the part that you admire most.

493
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,380
Stay true...

494
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,240
To your chosen path.

495
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,820
That's not the saying.

496
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,560
Before happy wife, happy life.

497
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,780
It was happy general, happy life.

498
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,340
Borrowed from Chao to defeat Yuan Shou before halting his forces in Shu province.

499
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,940
Meanwhile, in the city of Shu, one of the emperor's close retainers, was executed after his plans to revolt against Chao Chao were discovered.

500
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:17,960
The written agreement that bound the conspiracy together also fell into Chao Chao's hands, revealing Liu Bei's intention to rebel.

501
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,900
Liu Bei was left with very little time to prepare for the coming attack from Chao Chao's forces.

502
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,400
Country castle shall be county...

503
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,080
County...

504
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,880
Shall be commander of Shu province.

505
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:41,440
While Liu Bei is a way of negotiating the alliance with Yuan Shao, it's up to us to defend Xiaopei.

506
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,520
His family also resides within this castle.

507
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,060
Should anything happen, we must be ready to guard it with our lives.

508
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,840
His family?

509
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,700
We're his family!

510
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,420
What do you mean?

511
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,240
When did he get married?

512
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,620
But he might still send one of his stronger officers our way.

513
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,940
We need to stay on our guard.

514
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,240
I can't believe it.

515
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,780
I am sure Liu Bei and the others will be able to secure the lives.

516
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,640
Who needs family when you have your bros?

517
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,220
Exactly.

518
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,480
The four brothers.

519
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,160
All we can do is put our faith in them...

520
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,900
He had!

521
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,820
That's right!

522
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,420
Had!

523
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,740
It's not his time yet.

524
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,460
He needs more time with his bros, guys.

525
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,500
Where am I?

526
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,040
Did I get TP'd?

527
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,880
Where am I?

528
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Alright, let's...

529
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,720
I know I'm, like, missing a...

530
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,780
Oh, wait.

531
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,160
I'm here.

532
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,440
Okay.

533
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,460
Uh...

534
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,940
I got the battle arts.

535
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,400
Ooh.

536
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,300
Nice.

537
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,440
Okay, that's related to fisting.

538
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,900
Alright, let's see.

539
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,740
Weapon shop.

540
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,540
Let's see if there's anything new.

541
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,480
Okay, none of these weapons are good, actually.

542
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,180
Alright.

543
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,060
End time.

544
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,440
Let's look at my super chats.

545
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, I got a new outfit.

546
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,480
Oh!

547
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
What outfits do I have?

548
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,940
Okay, let's grab some gems first, though.

549
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,000
Alright.

550
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,740
Do I have any ye olde super chats?

551
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,260
What is the lion armor?

552
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,440
Okay.

553
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,620
I have the uniform.

554
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,220
Oh, my God!

555
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,000
I ain't no twink no more.

556
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,220
What the fuck is that?

557
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,700
Oh, that's cool.

558
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,020
It looks so ugly.

559
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,580
Okay, to be fair.

560
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,820
It looks like...

561
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,920
It looks like Zhao Yun's armor.

562
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,220
He's...

563
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,700
Look at those shoulder pads.

564
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,160
I'm definitely compensating for something.

565
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,000
You know what?

566
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,360
Yeah, it looks like...

567
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,400
It's a Zhao Yun's armor!

568
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,220
I knew it!

569
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,060
I was like, this looks like Zhao Yun's armor.

570
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,620
I fucking knew it.

571
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,380
I recognized the old main character's armor.

572
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,460
Like, he even has a...

573
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,420
That's right.

574
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,000
Never mind.

575
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,580
I might still be...

576
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,300
Not...

577
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,640
Oh, wait!

578
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,940
Ye olde super chat!

579
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,300
I'm Zhao Yun now.

580
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,620
Now, Toki, I'm right and thank you.

581
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm a soldier fighting for Lord Liu Bei, but I wish to remain anonymous.

582
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,780
Once again, you have saved me.

583
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,360
And this time, it's from none other than Lu Bu himself.

584
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,040
Typically, a nameless soldier like myself would be able to do nothing but shout Lu Bu's name before being...

585
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,780
It's Lu Bu!

586
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,800
...for being struck down.

587
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,440
But this time, his technical blade only managed to graze my skin.

588
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,560
It's because you were there.

589
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,880
Of course, you didn't notice my presence.

590
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,820
Saving one ordinary soldier is nothing unusual for you.

591
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,460
But it's not only for me.

592
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,600
Your deeds have given countless common people far longer lives.

593
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,280
And they were fated to live.

594
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,200
And all of us are grateful to you for every extra day we have.

595
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,260
Please never forget...

596
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,220
Look at that, guys!

597
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,100
Finally!

598
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,120
My common people can live up to 30 instead of...

599
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,520
instead of 20, guys.

600
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,280
I did it.

601
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,420
Look at that.

602
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,820
30 years old before he...

603
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,140
before he dies.

604
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,540
I did it for him.

605
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,060
All right.

606
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,460
Let's see.

607
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
All right.

608
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,880
I need to figure out...

609
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,440
Okay.

610
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,360
I need to check...

611
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,200
Okay.

612
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,820
Where's the map?

613
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,340
I need to check if I have any ye olde generals to romance.

614
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,440
Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

615
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
Any ye olde generals?

616
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,100
I know that I'm a father myself.

617
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,240
I finally understand.

618
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:41,840
All right.

619
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,580
Oh.

620
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,880
It's you.

621
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,960
All right.

622
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,660
Any interactions?

623
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,200
Oh, it doesn't look like it.

624
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,180
So...

625
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,020
No ye olde generals wants to talk to me.

626
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,940
Guys, I don't understand.

627
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,020
Where are my ye olde romance generals?

628
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,540
I thought we had something.

629
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,660
Okay.

630
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,660
I guess I have to go to Guan Yin.

631
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,000
It was like here.

632
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,400
Oh, wait.

633
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,360
But there's a...

634
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,240
Noink.

635
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,900
All right.

636
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,520
Go!

637
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,230
Hello.

638
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,030
Is something the matter?

639
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,310
Not exactly.

640
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,590
I am simply thinking about Liu Bei.

641
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,330
And where he might lead us from here.

642
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,570
When he told us that he had found his purpose.

643
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,610
When he decided to part ways with Lord Cao Cao.

644
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,690
To establish a base of our own.

645
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,830
I was happy.

646
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,430
If we could spare the people of this troubled world.

647
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,730
Even one source of grief.

648
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,210
Then, we sworn brothers would proudly charge into battle.

649
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,450
And yet, he still lacked a solid ambition for us to pursue.

650
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,470
He would speak of doing great things for the world.

651
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,830
But never decided what those great things would be.

652
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,090
But then, after fighting Liu Bei.

653
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,530
And having that discussion with Lord Cao Cao.

654
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,490
Something changed.

655
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,970
He found some sense of purpose.

656
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,790
This could well be the turning point.

657
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,710
That was, this was literally his peak in his career.

658
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,010
After that, it's all down.

659
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,570
Actually, no.

660
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,390
After the battle of Chibi, everything went downhill for him.

661
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,270
So, he still has time to peak in high school.

662
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,990
No matter what.

663
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,610
He peaked in Chibi.

664
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,800
I feel the same way.

665
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,460
So, he still has time to go up.

666
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,440
After that, everything was just downhill for him.

667
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,060
Cao Cao's forces are defensing the Xiaopei castle.

668
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,800
How could this be?

669
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,060
What about my brothers?

670
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,240
We have received no word.

671
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,800
There are rumors that they have fallen to Cao Cao's forces.

672
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,440
Please, sir, your orders.

673
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,640
Of course, we must defend the castle at all costs.

674
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,800
Don't worry.

675
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,640
You see my new armor?

676
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,640
It was a million dollars.

677
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,090
Alright.

678
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,430
Lubei's forces versus Chao Cao's forces.

679
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,710
Alright, let's see if...

680
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,430
Okay, what is the level for this?

681
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,810
Level 38.

682
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,070
Alright, let's grab some extra levels real quick.

683
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,790
We have it better than most, just being able to...

684
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,270
There was a...

685
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:46,910
Yeah, there you go.

686
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,130
How much?

687
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,090
Level 38.

688
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,750
Alright, let's grab some extra levels.

689
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,530
I'm gonna grab two guards with me, too.

690
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,530
Two dragoons...

691
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,610
Two lucky dragoons get to fight with me in this optional battle.

692
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,130
Yeah, they can't pierce...

693
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,090
They can't pierce this.

694
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,230
Oh my god, I actually look like Daoyun now.

695
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:07,910
I...

696
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,670
Guys, I don't remember...

697
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,750
What was the...

698
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,610
What was...

699
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,570
Okay, is this...

700
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:14,750
Okay.

701
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,410
I was gonna say, I actually don't remember...

702
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,150
My controls.

703
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,350
It's been way too long.

704
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,350
Oh no.

705
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,110
I don't remember.

706
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,770
Okay, it's fine.

707
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,510
I got it.

708
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,710
It's fine.

709
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,110
I'm figuring it out.

710
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,990
I'm figuring it out, guys.

711
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:39,870
Boom.

712
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,330
Twist.

713
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,270
Oh my god, I forgot.

714
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,570
The win.

715
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,450
I almost forgot.

716
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,790
The win.

717
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,830
Okay.

718
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,970
Oh my god, he's so fucking big.

719
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:53,930
I forgot.

720
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:54,930
I'm a short king.

721
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,210
The win.

722
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,050
Get wind.

723
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,210
The enemy officer...

724
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,290
Wait, they're preparing bullet attacks.

725
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,050
That's cheating.

726
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,350
Wait, that's cheating.

727
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,530
Someone is sowing chaos on the battlefield tonight.

728
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,710
I must stop them myself.

729
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:12,950
Okay.

730
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,970
No, I don't have enough win.

731
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,370
I don't have win attacks anymore.

732
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,790
This is bad.

733
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,690
How am I gonna use the win if I don't have...

734
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:21,930
The win?

735
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,050
Jesus Christ, it's a bullet.

736
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:25,690
Take this.

737
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,170
Oh my god.

738
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:27,570
Oh my god.

739
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,010
My win is actually betraying me.

740
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,130
I am...

741
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,070
It's like, where is he going?

742
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,790
Where is he going?

743
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,450
Nice.

744
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,070
The enemy officer has been defeated.

745
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,790
Wait, what...

746
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,730
What is my goal?

747
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,710
I just...

748
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,190
I...

749
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,310
Oh yeah, let me check if I have any tactics that I'm supposed to do as well.

750
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,130
Alright.

751
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,170
Who are...

752
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,590
None of these guys I really want to romance anyway.

753
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,830
So like, it doesn't really matter to me.

754
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,950
Alright, so...

755
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,970
None of these people matter.

756
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,630
That's fine.

757
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,210
Wait, I should...

758
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,230
Defeat...

759
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,850
Do I...

760
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,710
Hmm...

761
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,730
I guess I should...

762
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,470
Because he's still...

763
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,390
He's green, right?

764
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,330
This guy's green.

765
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,110
Oh, I guess.

766
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:07,870
Okay.

767
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,150
I need to use a sword.

768
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,910
Alright, where's my sword?

769
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,690
Where is it?

770
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,510
Sword time.

771
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,800
Okay, and then I have to use...

772
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:20,930
Uh...

773
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,170
What is it?

774
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,890
Wait, where did he go?

775
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,510
Okay.

776
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,710
Okay.

777
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:28,810
LB...

778
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,950
Left mouse...

779
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,610
LB...

780
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:31,730
Y.

781
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,210
Okay.

782
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,550
Okay, LB Y sword attacks.

783
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,290
Okay, that's cool.

784
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,830
I can do that.

785
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,130
Now, what is my purpose?

786
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,970
Oh, defeat Lu Bei.

787
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,630
Oh shit.

788
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,210
Oh my god.

789
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:40,490
Wait.

790
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:40,890
Okay.

791
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,450
Oh, it's just practice.

792
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,210
Okay, Guan Yun.

793
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,690
Get out of here.

794
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,130
That's right.

795
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,510
I can defeat the god of war.

796
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,210
Jesus.

797
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,390
Oh, I accidentally used my bread.

798
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,090
I was so confused.

799
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:58,710
I...

800
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,810
I got confused.

801
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,390
Don't worry.

802
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,490
I got this.

803
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,410
Oh my god.

804
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,390
Don't worry.

805
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,630
I can defeat him.

806
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,610
Before, he was a god.

807
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,870
He was a mere peasant.

808
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,470
Jesus Christ.

809
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,550
Jesus Christ.

810
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,110
He...

811
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,330
Why is he...

812
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,330
Oh my god.

813
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,110
He is so strong.

814
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,690
I'm like doing like tickle damage right now.

815
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,430
Like I...

816
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,970
I'm barely doing anything.

817
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:36,750
Alright.

818
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,370
It's okay.

819
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,930
I'm halfway there.

820
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,490
I'm halfway...

821
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:41,670
Oh!

822
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,470
I'm gonna have to pull back.

823
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,250
Okay.

824
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,750
Um...

825
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,890
This is...

826
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,530
My guards has fled.

827
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,570
My...

828
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,970
Guys, I don't understand.

829
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,030
Why did you leave?

830
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,270
Guys!

831
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,070
Please.

832
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,190
Guys, we can't defeat Won-Yun, guys!

833
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,930
He's not unstoppable!

834
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,130
Guys, it's possible!

835
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,190
Don't give up!

836
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,090
Save yourself!

837
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,170
Please!

838
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,810
Oh, God!

839
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,430
Oh, my God!

840
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,590
Wait, what do you mean?

841
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,170
Where did he go?

842
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,990
There he is.

843
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,710
There he is.

844
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,930
Oh, no.

845
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,890
Oh, my God!

846
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,190
Oh, thank God I had more soup.

847
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:47,690
Thank God.

848
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,070
I told you!

849
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,550
I told you, everyone!

850
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,790
We can still... Won-Yun!

851
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,430
Now we just need to cut off his head.

852
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,610
For pure accuracy.

853
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,610
For historical accuracy.

854
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,970
Wait, who's dying?

855
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,570
Wait, who's dying?

856
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,250
Oh, shit, he's dying.

857
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,690
Alright, do we save him though?

858
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,650
Oh, I guess... I guess we'll save him.

859
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,010
Alright, we didn't save him.

860
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,270
Now I am the new God of War.

861
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,650
My actual destiny.

862
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,090
There you go.

863
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,710
Eat your bread.

864
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,810
Eat your bread, everyone.

865
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,390
Nice.

866
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,190
Mine.

867
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,630
Mine now.

868
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,450
Boom.

869
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,190
Okay, have I... Did I do it?

870
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,970
Okay, 31.

871
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,790
We're almost there.

872
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,790
I keep using the wrong one for the horse because I'm so used to pressing...

873
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,010
Remember when I had to re-bind the horse?

874
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,150
Remember that?

875
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:54,910
Yeah.

876
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,790
Now I'm trying to remember to not use that button.

877
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,010
Cause it's not horse button.

878
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,710
And it's fucking me up because of it.

879
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,630
Alright, are you guys back?

880
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,010
Oh, you're back just cause I killed!

881
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,390
Quan Yun!

882
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,070
You guys came back!

883
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,510
Fucking cowards!

884
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,250
I can't believe it!

885
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,690
Just cause I killed Quan Yun, you came back!

886
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,030
Yes, we're back!

887
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,910
Of course we're back!

888
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,550
Quan Yun's dead!

889
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,950
Ta... Jokey.

890
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,470
It's called, um, Tactical Retreat.

891
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,890
Alright, nice.

892
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,970
Look at it.

893
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,290
Alright, nice.

894
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,850
Let me get him out of here.

895
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:45,990
Alright, nice.

896
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,330
Okay, we got... Okay, I...

897
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,470
I did it.

898
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,670
So now I can use my actual real weapon.

899
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,110
What was it?

900
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,630
It was like 224.

901
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,390
Alright, here we go.

902
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,570
Dragon's Destiny.

903
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,710
The real weapon is here.

904
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,890
Alright, get over here!

905
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,790
You think I'm afraid of...

906
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,590
Of rocks?!

907
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,610
That's fucking right!

908
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,230
Get outta here!

909
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,990
Wait, where are you?

910
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,790
Alright, nice.

911
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,730
This training match is a little too hardcore, Lube.

912
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,390
What do you mean?

913
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,650
I got the win!

914
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,550
How would I...

915
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,370
How can I fail if I have the power of the win on my side?

916
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,830
I nearly killed the God of War.

917
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,790
Get over here.

918
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,810
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

919
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:37,850
Get countered.

920
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,450
Get parried.

921
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,750
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

922
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,030
Win!

923
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,570
Your rock cannot stop me!

924
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,790
Oh shit, wait, who's that?

925
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,710
Wait, who needs help?

926
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,630
Oh shit.

927
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,170
Oh shit.

928
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,370
Give me a sec.

929
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,970
Alright, I got help.

930
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,970
I got help!

931
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,570
I got help!

932
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,490
Okay, who needs help?

933
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,250
Don't worry!

934
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,110
Oh my god, he's so far.

935
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,150
Wait, can I run past this?

936
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,530
Is this locked up?

937
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,610
Yeah, I can.

938
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,770
Alright, you guys don't matter.

939
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,750
Give me...

940
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,350
You guys...

941
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,330
Oh my god.

942
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,470
Guys, get out of here!

943
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,250
I'm trying to make sure he eats his bread!

944
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,190
Alright, eat your bread!

945
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:23,750
Nice.

946
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,770
Oh my god, he was almost dead!

947
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,250
You did not need my help!

948
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,550
Look at him!

949
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,030
He was one HP!

950
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:34,910
Alright.

951
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,330
Nice.

952
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,250
Jesus Christ, I better upgrade here.

953
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,010
I better level up after this.

954
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,770
With the amount of people I'm fucking beating up.

955
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,710
Alright, nice.

956
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,250
Win!

957
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,630
I'll never get tired of win.

958
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,890
With my four...

959
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,870
With the four elements.

960
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,650
Fire, rock, and wind...

961
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,850
Wind and...

962
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,710
Grass.

963
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,090
Doki, it's earth and air...

964
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,810
No, wind.

965
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,410
Besides, they're all dead anyway.

966
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,050
Alright.

967
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:16,930
Win!

968
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,650
Alright, nice.

969
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,650
We don't need water.

970
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,670
Okay.

971
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,950
All we need is these three.

972
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,150
Oh my god, how are you dying?!

973
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,730
Why is my...

974
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,570
Oh shit!

975
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,730
Why is my commander fucking fighting him?!

976
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,350
Oh my god, okay.

977
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,330
Uh...

978
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,290
Where's my defeat conditions?

979
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,590
Okay, why is he...

980
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,990
Okay, I guess we'll fight him.

981
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,690
What?

982
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,010
No, we don't need water.

983
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,870
We can just drink, like, ground water.

984
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,390
The retreat would be the best...

985
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,890
Okay.

986
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,990
Don't worry.

987
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,930
Drag wounds are here.

988
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,770
This tree grass...

989
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,630
Oh my god, you're right!

990
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,950
If we like...

991
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,330
We don't need water!

992
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,170
We have grass for that!

993
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,890
If you crush a grass plant, we'll just drink the...

994
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,990
We'll just drink the...

995
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,630
It's blood!

996
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,930
If you think about it...

997
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,610
If you think about it, if you crush...

998
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,630
The blood...

999
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,970
If you crush the blood...

1000
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,130
Off of...

1001
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,750
Technically, like, the innards of a grass is like...

1002
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,670
Their blood, right?

1003
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,670
So water...

1004
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,930
Water is like grass...

1005
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,330
Water is grass blood.

1006
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:43,810
Yeah!

1007
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,950
You are incredible!

1008
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:47,750
You know that?

1009
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,630
Keep doing what you're doing!

1010
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,930
Yeah!

1011
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,090
Cause when you rip a piece of the grass...

1012
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,830
They have like water inside them.

1013
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,190
And then...

1014
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,530
It's...

1015
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,050
It's literally...

1016
00:41:59,050 --> 00:41:59,890
Grass blood!

1017
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,330
So when we drink water, we're drinking grass...

1018
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,110
Grass blood.

1019
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,210
All right, nice.

1020
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,130
All right, nice.

1021
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,410
Just like how you drink normally.

1022
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,330
Yeah, exactly!

1023
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,770
I must retreat and rethink my plans.

1024
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:17,970
Charge.

1025
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,170
Okay, guys.

1026
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,250
He's right there.

1027
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:21,650
Guys!

1028
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,790
Okay, you're useless.

1029
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:27,130
I- I- I- Jeckos!

1030
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,950
You are actually...

1031
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,970
He gets paid.

1032
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,370
He's not good in a fight.

1033
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,670
He's like right there.

1034
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,030
Guys are like, I got you!

1035
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,990
Dohki, I got you!

1036
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,370
The enemy officer...

1037
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,390
Has been defeated.

1038
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,090
Oh, I didn't measure the range!

1039
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,810
You know, you guys could, like, look backwards.

1040
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,630
Alright, nice.

1041
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,230
That should be a level up, right?

1042
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:03,870
Yeah.

1043
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:06,350
Yeah!

1044
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,080
Nice, plus 37.

1045
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,100
Alright, uh, what was this one over here?

1046
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,920
Name is here to hold more.

1047
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,720
Okay, we don't need that.

1048
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,420
We need defense.

1049
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,020
So that I can get the bread.

1050
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,200
Bread is more important.

1051
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,540
Doki likes to break the... Thank you for the super chat.

1052
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,380
Thank you, thank you.

1053
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,160
Papa Smir, thank you for the super chat.

1054
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,960
Thank you, thank you.

1055
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,420
Doki pays us in Mantle.

1056
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,980
And it's shocked that there's not enough for us to fight the God of War.

1057
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,860
Oh, great.

1058
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,240
I got two more guides to, like, not do their jobs.

1059
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:43,960
Alright.

1060
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,320
Blunting enemy attacks and reducing damage.

1061
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,820
That's what I need, guys.

1062
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,640
Uh... Wait, actually, do I have anyone else I need to talk to?

1063
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,320
Since it's, like, a new objective?

1064
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,240
Let's double check.

1065
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,120
I just want to double check if there's anyone that wants to talk to me.

1066
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,200
Oh, I did it!

1067
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,300
Oh, just because I... Yeah, I did his mission.

1068
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:11,700
Okay.

1069
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,620
Djinn province.

1070
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,240
Oh, there's another one over here.

1071
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,480
Alright, what's the recommended level?

1072
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,420
39 already?

1073
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,860
Alright, let's... I don't want to deal with that.

1074
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,640
Okay, what was it?

1075
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,000
Djinn?

1076
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,740
Djinn... G... Sli... Djinn.

1077
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,240
Okay, there.

1078
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,100
Jesus Christ.

1079
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,380
But where?

1080
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,260
Where in Djinn?

1081
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,420
You guys... You guys... Okay, you guys are very useful, but definitely not in a fight.

1082
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,460
I'm sorry, Djinn.

1083
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,460
I will not call on you for a fight.

1084
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,460
I...

1085
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,280
Alright.

1086
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,860
You're right.

1087
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,700
The dating sim portion of this should let me...

1088
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,760
Should let me gain XP.

1089
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,500
What the heck?

1090
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,580
Okay.

1091
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,820
Prove me wrong.

1092
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,520
Prove me wrong that you guys are useful in a fight.

1093
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,980
Let's keep up with your weapon maintenance.

1094
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,160
Prove me wrong.

1095
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,960
You're not trusting your life to that thing after all.

1096
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,640
Sorry.

1097
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:13,900
We can't.

1098
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,640
Oh, there he is.

1099
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,460
I'm just fucking finding this guy.

1100
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:24,540
Yeah.

1101
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,840
No.

1102
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:26,440
No.

1103
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,420
Hello.

1104
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,640
I did your stupid mission thing.

1105
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,560
Oh, it's been some time since we met.

1106
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,540
Do you remember me?

1107
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,160
Sorry.

1108
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,540
Djinn was there.

1109
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,440
I could never forget you.

1110
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,600
Jesus Christ.

1111
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,020
Look, it is very hard to remember you when you were standing next to, like, the dragon himself.

1112
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,200
Really?

1113
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,400
I thought there was a good chance you wouldn't remember.

1114
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,780
I was so certain we'd meet again.

1115
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,000
I like how he's like, do you remember me?

1116
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,560
Sadly looks to the left.

1117
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,300
It's reached my ears that you now serve Lord New Bay.

1118
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,680
Is that right?

1119
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,160
I've just been wandering the land without aim.

1120
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,440
But you, you're different.

1121
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,080
You've been fulfilling your role as a guardian of peace.

1122
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,100
That's me.

1123
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,120
Don't you serve anyone?

1124
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,420
That's quite a difficult question for me.

1125
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,960
I studied under Master Shui Jing, a teacher to many talented individuals.

1126
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,460
Shui Jing.

1127
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,380
And in order to keep up with them, I've had to make immense effort.

1128
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,440
Now, however, I find myself facing a dilemma.

1129
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,840
Which path will resolve the turmoil plaguing the land, yet also lead to a better future?

1130
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,580
If what I've heard on my travels is accurate, either Lord Cao Cao or Lord Yuan Shao...

1131
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,460
You're wearing green.

1132
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,000
We all know where you're gonna join.

1133
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,220
Still, I refuse to give up...

1134
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,740
We know where you're going.

1135
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,100
You don't have to pretend.

1136
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,180
But...

1137
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,760
I am nobody.

1138
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,360
If I actually had talent...

1139
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,000
Perhaps I could help Lord Buu Bae find a path to victory.

1140
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,760
You should at least try...

1141
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,180
You are capable of it.

1142
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,420
I believe so.

1143
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,560
I see now...

1144
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,940
I gotta give him the confidence.

1145
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,200
I apologize.

1146
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,560
There was no need to burden you with my personal worries.

1147
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,880
Lassen rubs his head.

1148
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,400
Shit.

1149
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,680
Bites his lip.

1150
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,200
I feel the urge to show my true self instead of keeping...

1151
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,060
When I'm with you, I feel the urge to show my true...

1152
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,440
Oh my god!

1153
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:53,960
Bro!

1154
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,280
What are these lines?

1155
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
I'm glad I found you.

1156
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,260
I feel he helped me clarify my dreams.

1157
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,580
It's my eyes.

1158
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,260
Yeah, he's looking to my eyes.

1159
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,180
I think I shall end my travel soon.

1160
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,560
Oh my god.

1161
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,020
Then, I'll pledge my services to Lord Buu Bae...

1162
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,200
And present him with my strategy for victory.

1163
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:13,500
I did it.

1164
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,540
I'd appreciate your patience until then.

1165
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,500
I look forward to us serving him together.

1166
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,900
With my charms, I have recruited another general to Buu Bae's army.

1167
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,600
How could he fuck up now?

1168
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,340
How could Buu Bae fuck up with all these talented generals I recruited?

1169
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,720
Surely he's gonna win the Three Kingdoms War.

1170
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,580
Alright, more.

1171
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,580
Out of seven battle art chains to feed 200 enemies with a charged strong attack.

1172
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,540
To feed 200 foes with charged strong...

1173
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,860
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1174
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,660
I've been completely immersed in a diligent study.

1175
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,940
Allow me to share the fruits of my scholarship with you.

1176
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,760
That's all I can do to be of use of Lu Bae now.

1177
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,460
Surely, right guys?

1178
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,500
Surely you can't fuck this up.

1179
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,780
The children remain innocent and unflappable.

1180
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,740
Alright, let's go back to...

1181
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,460
Let's go back here.

1182
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,520
Alright, I need to check what my...

1183
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,800
What my destiny stuff is.

1184
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,540
Okay, I don't know what dramatic success of a tactic one time.

1185
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,480
Like, what is that?

1186
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,280
I don't understand what this is from Peng Tong.

1187
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,200
Alright, uh...

1188
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,820
What else?

1189
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,740
Jesus, there's so many I haven't talked to.

1190
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,160
Uh, battle art chains.

1191
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,460
Uh...

1192
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,560
Okay, we'll focus on...

1193
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,760
Okay, he wants me to pull a paddle.

1194
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,800
And using a lance.

1195
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,960
Okay, we'll use a lance.

1196
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,640
Alright.

1197
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,580
Never mind.

1198
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,600
We're not using a...

1199
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,220
Never mind.

1200
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,780
All of my weapons fucking sucks.

1201
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,500
Ah!

1202
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,200
Okay, we'll use a lance first.

1203
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,700
So guys, what is firing enemies down?

1204
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,900
Oh, from a height.

1205
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,340
Okay.

1206
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,320
Okay.

1207
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,280
I will definitely not do that.

1208
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:05,820
Oh.

1209
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,600
This might be an issue.

1210
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,700
Roy, thank you for the super chat.

1211
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,040
Thank you.

1212
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,720
Thank you.

1213
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,020
So we pay Peng Tong to rank up our bonds.

1214
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,720
Let's make him our wingman.

1215
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,980
Most fucking expensive wingman.

1216
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,460
Thank you for the super chat.

1217
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:23,840
Thank you.

1218
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,540
Thank you.

1219
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,960
Lu Bei jump there, leaving Sha Pi to ally with Yuan Shao's forces.

1220
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,800
In their absence, the defense of Shao Pi's castle falls to me.

1221
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,820
Not only is this castle the base from which Lu Bei's destiny will take flight, it is a place his family members call home.

1222
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,660
Which I...

1223
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,960
Why I am certain my sworn brothers will return.

1224
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,720
And why I am determined to guard this castle with my life.

1225
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,360
First, we must rout the enemy trying to breach these walls.

1226
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,020
Then we shall cut down the advancing invaders with the castle to our back.

1227
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:59,220
Faced with the reality of Shao Tao's forces, even I find myself stunned at the audacity of the fear we're about to attempt.

1228
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,880
Yet, attempt it we must.

1229
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,580
And I truly believe we can succeed.

1230
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,160
To that end, I entrust my back to you.

1231
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,960
Just like when we first met, Guan Yun.

1232
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,800
That's right.

1233
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,340
When you face the government army.

1234
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,560
With my blade at his command, Lu Bei shall protect the future.

1235
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,480
Alright.

1236
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,720
Begin the battle.

1237
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,480
Two gorillas.

1238
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,500
Who will win?

1239
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,180
Two gorillas versus Shao Tao's army.

1240
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,920
That's right.

1241
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,240
Wait, what was my objective for this?

1242
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,540
I forgot.

1243
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:44,920
Alright, let's see.

1244
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,700
With charge attacks.

1245
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,200
Okay.

1246
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,400
How do I use it?

1247
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,620
Oh, this is the charge attack.

1248
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:53,980
Okay.

1249
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,520
I was like, where the fuck is the charge?

1250
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,600
Jesus Christ.

1251
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,900
Weapon fucking sucks.

1252
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:06,780
There you go.

1253
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,720
Alright, guys.

1254
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm not using this.

1255
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,300
This weapon actually sucks.

1256
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,700
This weapon is so bad.

1257
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,400
Give me back Dragoon Destiny.

1258
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:17,780
Alright.

1259
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,620
Oh my god.

1260
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,400
That's so much more damage.

1261
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:23,920
Alright.

1262
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:24,520
Sorry.

1263
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,200
No romancing for him for now.

1264
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:29,720
Alright.

1265
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,940
We met with our blades.

1266
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,420
Is he okay?

1267
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,400
Is he okay?

1268
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,420
Don't worry.

1269
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,780
I'm coming over.

1270
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,180
Wait, how do I get over there?

1271
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,820
Oh, I have to go outside.

1272
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:53,660
Whoops.

1273
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,880
Okay, give me a sec.

1274
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,520
I fucked up.

1275
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,400
He might be dead.

1276
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,940
Oh, shit.

1277
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:00,920
Alright.

1278
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,200
The other guy might be dead to the right.

1279
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,560
I swear I read the wrong way.

1280
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,020
I'm sorry.

1281
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,380
Where is he advancing?

1282
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:10,920
Oh, wait.

1283
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,260
He's gonna fucking die.

1284
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,360
As long as I'm here, you won't get through.

1285
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,260
Oh my god!

1286
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,760
Eat your bread!

1287
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,240
Eat your bread!

1288
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,680
I did it.

1289
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:20,900
I'm a hero.

1290
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,160
Be a hero.

1291
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,120
Nice.

1292
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,900
The enemy officer has been a great help indeed.

1293
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,140
Allow us to defend the gate.

1294
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,120
Alright.

1295
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,160
And then, how do we get to the next side?

1296
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,540
Where did I go wrong?

1297
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,400
Oh, shit!

1298
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,220
Don't worry!

1299
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,080
I'm coming over!

1300
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:45,840
I'm coming over!

1301
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,560
So you've got... Eat your bread!

1302
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,100
Eat your bread!

1303
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,840
Sorry, but your help is needed here.

1304
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,640
Alright, nice.

1305
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,980
I would be honored.

1306
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,060
If I could test my skills.

1307
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,460
Win!

1308
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,360
Oh, shit.

1309
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,580
Oh, shit.

1310
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,200
Okay, I thought you would get hit by the winner earlier.

1311
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,600
Nice.

1312
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,960
Alright.

1313
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,460
Nice.

1314
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,120
Alright, he's almost dead, guys.

1315
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,500
Halfway is almost, right?

1316
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,220
Halfway is technically... ALMOST!

1317
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,260
God, I love the wind fight.

1318
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,900
The wind is so strong.

1319
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,860
Holy fuck.

1320
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,580
I already broke his armor again.

1321
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,800
That's actually crazy.

1322
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,160
How fast the wind is.

1323
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,540
What would you do against the wind?

1324
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,180
Nothing!

1325
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,720
Get out of here!

1326
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,320
What?

1327
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:37,980
You're still alive?

1328
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,440
What the fuck?

1329
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,360
Get out of here!

1330
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,560
Get out!

1331
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,220
You're not the main character here!

1332
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,920
Well, I still can.

1333
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:47,740
Okay.

1334
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:48,740
Let's go.

1335
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,380
Oh, shit.

1336
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,020
Is that another general coming over?

1337
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,620
No, leave.

1338
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,660
Oh, wait.

1339
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:56,940
There is.

1340
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,360
Oh, wait.

1341
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,000
But that's just, like, one guy.

1342
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,420
It's fine.

1343
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,440
Alright, guys.

1344
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,240
This is it!

1345
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,120
Use your arrows!

1346
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,140
Win!

1347
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,480
Oh, my god.

1348
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,620
He instantly died.

1349
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,020
Oh, that was fast.

1350
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:13,360
Okay.

1351
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,340
I was not expecting him to die that fast.

1352
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,760
That's right.

1353
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,480
Boom!

1354
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,300
Easiest fucking fight of my life.

1355
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:23,760
Alright, guys.

1356
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,140
Who are you gonna charge this time?

1357
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,700
Okay, the general is right here, but that's okay.

1358
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,660
That's okay.

1359
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,800
You guys missed the general yet again, but that's okay.

1360
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,340
I believe in you.

1361
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,200
I hate it.

1362
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,200
See you were useful in, right?

1363
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,320
Let's test that theory first.

1364
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:44,960
Test what theory?

1365
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Wait, what?

1366
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,660
Oh, no.

1367
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,360
Oh, no.

1368
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,300
Oh, no.

1369
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,760
They're doing what I've done last time!

1370
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,540
Using my strategy against me?!

1371
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,800
That's illegal!

1372
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,160
They're stealing my strats!

1373
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,420
Oh, shit.

1374
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,500
I'm blocking Guan Yu.

1375
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,980
Wait, who?

1376
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,340
Why can't he just do that?!

1377
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,640
They can just do that?!

1378
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,360
Steal my strategy?!

1379
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,500
I cop- I padded it!

1380
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,640
It's copyrighted to me!

1381
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,760
She- you didn't copy- you didn't copyright your strats!

1382
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,460
How was I supposed to do?!

1383
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,580
They could just steal it!

1384
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,260
Oh, no.

1385
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,940
Okay, we gotta go back again.

1386
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,380
Alright.

1387
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,140
Wait, do I have to kill- Wait, who?

1388
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,120
Again?

1389
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,560
I- I just left!

1390
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,680
What the fuck?!

1391
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,520
The resistance cannot last forever.

1392
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,440
So, what am I going to do with you?

1393
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,180
Okay.

1394
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,020
And I thought they'd come marching in with a huge army.

1395
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,800
Okay, nice.

1396
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,660
That's right.

1397
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,740
We don't need a- we don't need a big army!

1398
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,080
We just need two gorillas!

1399
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,160
Me and Quan Yun!

1400
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:14,420
Me and Quan Yun!

1401
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:14,440
No,

1402
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,020
no.

1403
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,920
No, no.

1404
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:19,320
No, no.

1405
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:19,420
No, no.

1406
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,160
No, no!

1407
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,140
No.

1408
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:26,960
No, no!

1409
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,540
This is the Gorilla situation.

1410
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,500
No!

1411
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,120
No, no!

1412
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:32,460
Alright.

1413
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,720
Oh, shit.

1414
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:35,880
Wait!

1415
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,680
All right.

1416
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,740
But- for real- Ha-ha!

1417
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,140
Does it look like a hundred guys are gonna be crucified?

1418
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,880
Are you going to win this?

1419
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,040
I don't think so.

1420
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:53,860
Still, he must be getting quite nervous under these circumstances.

1421
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,600
Let's take advantage of the situation while he's on the back foot.

1422
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,360
Alright, nice.

1423
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,280
Jesus Christ, they're sending more?

1424
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,060
The enemy formation has changed.

1425
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,480
Perhaps he could approach the enemy's stronghold now.

1426
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,320
Oh no, he's getting overconfident.

1427
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,980
Oh no, Guan Yu, stop!

1428
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,360
You're getting overconfident, Guan Yu!

1429
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,220
No!

1430
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,860
You're not the strategist!

1431
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,580
Guan Yu, stop!

1432
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,360
I'm still needed.

1433
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,160
And that means I must fall back for now.

1434
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,680
Looks like it worked.

1435
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,780
Now, it's time to put an end to Guan Yu.

1436
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,700
Oh no.

1437
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,840
Oh no!

1438
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,520
Guys!

1439
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,100
We will change history!

1440
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,480
I was more than ready for a trap.

1441
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:51,980
Wait!

1442
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,820
I'll cleave my way through and bring us as much closer to the people.

1443
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,560
Did we change history?

1444
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,420
We saved him?

1445
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,660
With this, we have put Guan Yu in the back.

1446
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,080
Oh wait, shit.

1447
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:05,460
Let me uh...

1448
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,960
Shall we initiate the advance?

1449
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,340
Oh god.

1450
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,380
God.

1451
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,920
If the castle falls, all of this will be for naught.

1452
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,120
Guan Yu, please!

1453
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,300
All we can do now is fight the foes before us.

1454
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,780
Alright, we got rid of him.

1455
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,460
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1456
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,760
Now believe in your allies and in our victory to come.

1457
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,840
Jesus Christ, you're so many!

1458
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,420
You need two gorillas!

1459
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,420
I'm the second gorilla!

1460
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,180
I'm coming over!

1461
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,840
Don't worry!

1462
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,220
The second gorilla!

1463
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:46,980
I can't!

1464
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,460
There's too many people!

1465
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,420
Wait, I did it.

1466
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:50,580
Wait, no.

1467
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:50,800
Okay.

1468
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,480
I didn't do it.

1469
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,540
There's still more.

1470
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,660
There's more coming in.

1471
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,260
I trust Quan.

1472
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:57,980
Oh yeah!

1473
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:58,660
What about me?

1474
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,480
Guys, guys!

1475
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,860
I'm part of- I'm part of the Quan Yu army too, guys.

1476
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:09,460
What about me?

1477
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,580
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1478
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,760
I'm here too, guys.

1479
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,220
I'm here too.

1480
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,480
Wait, you are?

1481
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,040
Oh shit.

1482
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,800
Oh, I'm ready to face you.

1483
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,540
Your design is so boring.

1484
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,560
I'm definitely- You have like three shields.

1485
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,860
Like, I'm not scared.

1486
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,400
You have three shields.

1487
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,780
There we go.

1488
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,360
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1489
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,760
So that I may fight again.

1490
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,500
Why are you fighting one guy?

1491
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,000
I fought like 20!

1492
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,060
Guys, and you're still cheering for him?

1493
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,760
I literally fought 20 generals!

1494
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:55,680
Alright.

1495
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
Let's move, brother.

1496
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,020
That's fucked up.

1497
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,360
That's fucked up.

1498
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,560
You know what I'm most insecure about.

1499
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,000
You know this is my insecurity!

1500
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,080
That doesn't matter.

1501
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,740
It's not just one guy.

1502
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,240
How am I still fighting?

1503
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:21,720
Alright.

1504
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,120
Time to attack.

1505
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,160
Nice.

1506
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:25,580
Okay.

1507
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,480
Zero time.

1508
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,140
Nice.

1509
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:34,440
Alright.

1510
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:35,800
That's fucking right!

1511
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,600
No it won't!

1512
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,560
I'm still going!

1513
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,260
That's fucking right!

1514
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,620
Get out of here!

1515
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,640
What, what, what the fuck?

1516
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,860
Who interrupted my fight?

1517
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,760
He's fucking interrupted!

1518
01:01:59,220 --> 01:01:59,380
He's fucking interrupted!

1519
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,300
I shall analyze later, but now I must pull back.

1520
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,980
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1521
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,220
My mission is far from complete.

1522
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,640
There's still more?

1523
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,920
I have no choice but to retreat now.

1524
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,540
Alright.

1525
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:12,500
That's fine.

1526
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,460
Turn the tables.

1527
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:14,980
That's fine!

1528
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,420
Wind!

1529
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,500
Random drive by spirit.

1530
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:21,540
Wait.

1531
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,500
And Gwanyu didn't even defeat him!

1532
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,180
He fucking ran away!

1533
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,460
I defeated all my generals!

1534
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,780
Time to act?

1535
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,160
I think I might be the...

1536
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,640
Oh my god.

1537
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,460
He just ran...

1538
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:34,660
What?

1539
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,400
He just ran off?

1540
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:37,380
What?

1541
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
He just...

1542
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,140
He just ran away from...

1543
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,400
Wait!

1544
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,400
Where are you going?

1545
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,900
He just ran away from my wind!

1546
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,540
He's like...

1547
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,960
He drove away!

1548
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,200
You can do that?

1549
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,140
You can just run away?

1550
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,540
Get back!

1551
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,410
It's called...

1552
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,220
A tactical retreat!

1553
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,780
You can just do that?

1554
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,820
Hehehehe!

1555
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,140
That's possible?

1556
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,040
Alright.

1557
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:11,420
Nice.

1558
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:13,820
Jesus Christ!

1559
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,380
Oh my god!

1560
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:19,640
Oh my god!

1561
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,440
Give me a sec!

1562
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,020
There's so many!

1563
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,680
I like...

1564
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,400
I don't know what's going on anymore.

1565
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,180
Better back off.

1566
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:32,540
Okay.

1567
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,400
We've broken through!

1568
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,100
This is our chance!

1569
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,420
What do you mean this is your...

1570
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,240
I'm so...

1571
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:39,760
Oh my god!

1572
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,740
Gwanyu, come back!

1573
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,600
Gwanyu, don't!

1574
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,620
Come back!

1575
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,600
I need help!

1576
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:45,620
Help!

1577
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,940
Don't fight!

1578
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:50,640
Don't!

1579
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,940
I need help!

1580
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:52,680
Gwanyu!

1581
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,020
Please!

1582
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,940
I've proved I'm a true warrior.

1583
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,220
Come back here!

1584
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,320
I'm still fighting!

1585
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,940
What do you mean?

1586
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,560
No help!

1587
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,160
Hahaha.

1588
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,680
I'm still trying to kill him!

1589
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,080
Goyun, please!

1590
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,840
Jesus Christ, I don't want Fred anymore.

1591
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,620
It's fine.

1592
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,820
Okay, why is that so loud?

1593
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,080
No help, he really wants that.

1594
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,960
Goyun, he's literally coming to me!

1595
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,440
He's literally coming over!

1596
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,960
Goyun, please!

1597
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,480
The enemy officer had so much fun.

1598
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,080
But it seems...

1599
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,280
He's finally... He's only coming over because Shao Udun is heading to me.

1600
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,260
Alright.

1601
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,320
That's right, it's me.

1602
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,040
It's me!

1603
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,960
It was always me!

1604
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,820
Alright.

1605
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:07,400
Where is he?

1606
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,140
Oh, there he is.

1607
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,380
Jesus Christ!

1608
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,700
I'm heading over!

1609
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,440
Oh, shit!

1610
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,180
There he is!

1611
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,400
Goyun, please!

1612
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,500
Get over here!

1613
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:17,420
Hahaha!

1614
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,960
Thanks, there's so many!

1615
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,040
I'm sorry.

1616
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,080
I'm going to withdraw!

1617
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:26,860
What do you mean?

1618
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,280
Dragon!

1619
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,320
What do you mean?

1620
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,060
That's it.

1621
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:31,760
That's it.

1622
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,700
I'm going in.

1623
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,600
I told you.

1624
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,880
I told you this was basically...

1625
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,060
Jesus Christ.

1626
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,920
You broke through that encirclement.

1627
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,340
That's fucking right.

1628
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,420
This is the gorilla situation.

1629
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,360
I told you.

1630
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,460
I told you.

1631
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,380
I told you.

1632
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,900
I told you.

1633
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,680
What do you mean, Goyun?

1634
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,500
What do you mean, Goyun?!

1635
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,640
I'm 1v7ing!

1636
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,800
Why is it always Goyun?!

1637
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:19,900
Alright.

1638
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,320
Why is it always Quanyu?

1639
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,320
Why does no one ask about Doki?

1640
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,420
I don't understand!

1641
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,260
He's Quanyu, he did so much.

1642
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,300
I never moved from this spot.

1643
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:39,520
No!

1644
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:41,820
No!

1645
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,420
No!

1646
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,540
I would have saved my musu if I knew!

1647
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,700
Are you serious?

1648
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,460
Oh my god.

1649
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,160
Oh shit.

1650
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,680
Okay, this is... you can't fuck this up.

1651
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,340
You can't fuck this up, guys.

1652
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,180
You literally can't fuck this up.

1653
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,340
You can't fuck this up!

1654
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,300
I jumped out!

1655
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,380
Wait, everybody's dead.

1656
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,520
Okay.

1657
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,040
Where is he?

1658
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,600
Where is Guanyu?

1659
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,900
Guys, I think you guys just all died.

1660
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,080
Zero out of 17.

1661
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,780
Um, you guys actually all died.

1662
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,720
I like walked around him and you all died.

1663
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,120
Whoopsie!

1664
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,320
I just let him musu all of you.

1665
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,300
This is all... this is... this was your dead bodies.

1666
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,920
Right here.

1667
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,040
No chance of winning.

1668
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:56,640
What?

1669
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,160
One of the drag wounds that died.

1670
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,900
Right here.

1671
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,720
Yeah, wait, what?

1672
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,000
Wait, what?

1673
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,100
It's not over?

1674
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:09,560
Oh wait!

1675
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,840
We better retreat for now and bolster the castles that...

1676
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,300
We still have information.

1677
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,500
No matter how many people you throw at me.

1678
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,880
As long as I draw breath...

1679
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,380
You killed one guy!

1680
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,140
And he tactically retreated!

1681
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:32,990
Alright, nice.

1682
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,460
Alright, nice.

1683
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,500
I get more... the... why, why, why, why, why thrusts.

1684
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,200
Okay, level 41.

1685
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:46,760
Yay!

1686
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,520
Level 20, horse!

1687
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,400
More buns.

1688
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,860
Uh, Lush knocks nearby enemies off balance.

1689
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,680
That's not how history sees it.

1690
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,640
I was part of the history!

1691
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,740
Anton, thank you in the super chat.

1692
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,080
Thank you.

1693
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,740
Thank you.

1694
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,820
When you, when he wrote the game, they were thinking of a certain market share.

1695
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:26,020
I think, say, Doki, what's your opinion on beefcake historical Chinese warriors who talk about their feelings?

1696
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,020
Thank you in the super chat.

1697
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:28,880
Thank you.

1698
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,120
Thank you.

1699
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,280
I should have went to the Sun class.

1700
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,360
Such spirit!

1701
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:43,030
I can't believe Gwanyun saved everyone!

1702
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:43,650
Oh!

1703
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,590
Guess who's not in this cutscene!

1704
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:46,850
Yet again!

1705
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,690
Lord Gwanyu!

1706
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:55,470
Look at that Gwanyun doing all the work!

1707
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,690
Look at him go!

1708
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:56,910
The castle has already fallen!

1709
01:09:58,830 --> 01:09:59,750
Surrender at once!

1710
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:00,510
What do you mean?

1711
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,090
I killed 20 generals!

1712
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:04,530
How did we lose the castle?

1713
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:05,670
I should fight...

1714
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:06,630
To my last breath!

1715
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,590
When you beat a thousand enemies!

1716
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:18,470
Oh, Gwanyun!

1717
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:19,310
You are the strongest!

1718
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:22,270
You would dishonor yourself!

1719
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:24,810
Out of stubborn pride!

1720
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,290
You would let Liu Bei family die?

1721
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,770
Breaking your vow to your sworn brothers that you would die together!

1722
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:32,450
Damn!

1723
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:37,150
Defying your duty to protect that which Liu Bei entrusted to you!

1724
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,250
They never even died together anyway!

1725
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:40,850
Would your honor...

1726
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,610
Truly allow that?

1727
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,030
I was actually like fighting my...

1728
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,430
My demons...

1729
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:51,150
My mind...

1730
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:52,010
I need...

1731
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,730
Three promises from you!

1732
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,230
During that, I thought I was fighting 20 generals, but he locked me into like a padded room!

1733
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:57,930
I will surrender...

1734
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:00,150
To the Emperor...

1735
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,530
Not to Lord...

1736
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:02,290
Cao Cao!

1737
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,550
No harm...

1738
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:08,630
Shall come to the family condiciones of Liu Bei..

1739
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,590
And the moment...

1740
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:15,490
I find those brothers, I shall run to their side!

1741
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:15,890
I shall run to their side!

1742
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,590
Uh huh!

1743
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:22,010
You have my word!

1744
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:25,630
I...

1745
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,950
Shall convey your wishes to...

1746
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,230
I accept those terms!

1747
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,250
Oh my god!

1748
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:31,690
So how?

1749
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,610
How outstanding!

1750
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:35,390
To have a renowned hero...

1751
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,810
Such as you, on our side.

1752
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:39,650
This is the one time Guan Yun was in his army.

1753
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,030
Where he was blue.

1754
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,030
May our acquaintance be long and fruitful.

1755
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:50,150
Taucha has always had, like, this, like, lifelong crush on Guan Yun for the longest time.

1756
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:56,930
He was, like, that ga- that girl, like, looking in the side and be like, I hope Senpai would notice me.

1757
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:01,470
And he would, like, stalk him all the time.

1758
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,460
Wait, so what happens to me?

1759
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,150
What happens to me?

1760
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:19,230
Oh, am I, like, just, like, his plus one?

1761
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:24,630
Like, I'm just his plus one?

1762
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:28,330
If Guan Yun joins, I have to be dragged along.

1763
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:35,510
Hey, I'm here too, Tao Tao.

1764
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:39,590
Packed deal.

1765
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,630
What do

1766
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,260
you mean?

1767
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:47,500
Yes.

1768
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,640
I would like for Guan Yun to eventually come under my command.

1769
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,720
He's like, chaperone on that.

1770
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:57,500
I want him to walk with the path to the path to the path.

1771
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,720
I'm not allowed to go around without an adult.

1772
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,180
I will stay by my brother's side for as long as I draw breath.

1773
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,280
And what if Liu Bei is no longer of this world?

1774
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:17,880
Hey,

1775
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,480
I'm here, too.

1776
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,440
We'll ask my opinion whether or not we'll join your army.

1777
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,100
Hey, I'm here, too, guys!

1778
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,220
He has been incredibly generous.

1779
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:35,660
And has treated Liu Bei's family well.

1780
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:35,840
Shh!

1781
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,640
Doki, the adults are talking.

1782
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,080
That is a bet I must repay in full before I leave.

1783
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:42,820
But I do not intend to stay here long.

1784
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,640
I will leave.

1785
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,260
As soon as I know where my brother has gone.

1786
01:13:49,020 --> 01:14:01,140
No matter how many losses he suffers, or how weak he becomes, my brother is the only one that can bring salvation to the victims of our troubled times.

1787
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,120
I truly believe that.

1788
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,120
Not so dead, but thank you for the super chat.

1789
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,120
Thank you, thank you.

1790
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,180
All right.

1791
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:13,140
Well...

1792
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,340
We're in Tao Tao's army now.

1793
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,400
Good thing I have Liu.

1794
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:17,560
Good thing I have...

1795
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,780
I never expected you to fall back under my influence.

1796
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:20,340
Oh, hey!

1797
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:20,860
Yay!

1798
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,840
Oh, now we have a private one-to-one conversation after you didn't talk to me before.

1799
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,240
I was certain we would never get another chance to meet like this.

1800
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,620
I'm like his rebound.

1801
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,780
After Guanyu rejected him.

1802
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,840
But now, when you and Guanyu have fallen right into my hands.

1803
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,540
I can think of no greater gift.

1804
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,040
And now he wants me.

1805
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,020
Fuck it, I'm happy to be here.

1806
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:46,520
Don't fall for it.

1807
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,020
Shh, don't tell Liu Bei.

1808
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,160
Are you?

1809
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,320
Well, it's good that you've made up your mind.

1810
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,000
After the loss of Sharpay.

1811
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,100
Don't fall for it.

1812
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,840
You may stay here for as long as you wish.

1813
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:08,320
Of course, if you're already determined to stay, I'd much rather you remain permanently in my service.

1814
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,300
In any case, I see no reason to keep you under guard.

1815
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,360
I promise you will be treated with all the respect a guest is due.

1816
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,000
That's why I'm wearing blue and green, guys.

1817
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,940
Never trust the uniform.

1818
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:22,880
I'm not saying that we will also be well taken care of.

1819
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,320
I wouldn't dare disrespect your loyalty to him.

1820
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,380
Get some rest for now, Zuluan.

1821
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,600
May your next journey be fruitful.

1822
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,540
And hopefully, at my side.

1823
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,180
Why didn't you talk to me like that when Guan Yin was here?

1824
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,540
Finally found myself a job.

1825
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,800
I don't understand, huh?

1826
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:00,220
I was right there, but he didn't talk to me like that before.

1827
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,440
All right, let's see.

1828
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,240
Things have gotten so much better.

1829
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,440
All right, what does Chow Chow want?

1830
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,080
He was shy.

1831
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,960
I was the rebound because Guan Yin said no.

1832
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,900
He treated me like a fucky rebound.

1833
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:28,520
They must be trying to quash our potential strategies with sheer numbers.

1834
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:36,900
Be that as it may, any commander who would lead such a massive army is bound to let his hubris get the better of them.

1835
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,280
We must discover and strike at where they have been negligent.

1836
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:42,740
Hmm.

1837
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,920
The question is, how?

1838
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,520
Send a small force to ambush them.

1839
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:49,900
No.

1840
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:53,980
It would be but a momentary diversion against an army that large.

1841
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:00,420
Though if we can separate their forces, we may be able to take them down one group at a time.

1842
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,300
Separate them how?

1843
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,720
I doubt you and Chow would be easily fooled.

1844
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:14,160
If one wants to catch a catfish sleeping at the bottom of a pond, one must use valuable bait.

1845
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,400
Ooh.

1846
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:16,980
Bait?

1847
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:17,680
Yeah.

1848
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:19,640
Very well.

1849
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,960
I will join the assault.

1850
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,020
Oh!

1851
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,840
We're going to use Chow Chow's bait.

1852
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,570
This town has gotten bigger.

1853
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,270
Chow Chow's forces.

1854
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:35,210
Oh, wait.

1855
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:36,490
You have received a letter.

1856
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:37,090
A letter?

1857
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,390
Whenever Lord Quo-Chow does.

1858
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:38,890
That's a letter.

1859
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:39,990
Thank you for the raid.

1860
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:40,450
Thank you.

1861
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:41,090
Thank you.

1862
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,990
Whose letter is it?

1863
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:45,210
I just got a letter.

1864
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,910
I just got a letter.

1865
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:47,510
Oh, wait.

1866
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,630
Oh, it's just my doctor who's sitting right beside me.

1867
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:52,750
I must mention that your stomach seems all but indestructible.

1868
01:17:52,930 --> 01:18:00,670
Whether it's slurring up filthy pond water, scarfing down unknown species of mushrooms, or sinking your teeth into a half-cooked meal.

1869
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:03,190
Wait, where am I in the reading?

1870
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:05,290
Nothing ever appears to affect you.

1871
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:08,330
I see people like this from time to time.

1872
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:14,410
They've built up resilience to all sorts of things by surviving in the harshest conditions.

1873
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:17,630
The thing is that medicine tests do not do much for them either.

1874
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:20,770
So as a doctor, I need to be careful when working with them.

1875
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:24,870
I bet you're nearly immune to poison as- How would you know that?

1876
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:28,930
Have you- Did you try to poison me?

1877
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:31,950
How do you know if I'm nearly immune to poison?

1878
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:34,290
We never tested that out.

1879
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:38,110
But it wouldn't make much sense to have you ingest some just to check.

1880
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,750
So we'll never be sure.

1881
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:43,450
Sure, you never tested it on me.

1882
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:50,950
That said, we can submerge that yet perhaps been gradually exposed to various hazards from a young age to train your body to resist their effects.

1883
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,370
I don't know.

1884
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,870
I don't trust my my child doctor.

1885
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,050
I don't think I trust him guys.

1886
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:01,590
Why did he say I'm nearly immune to poison?

1887
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:03,470
How would he know?

1888
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:07,730
All right, let us see.

1889
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:16,070
Let us see if we have any- Any interactions with people.

1890
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:21,210
All right, we don't.

1891
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:21,870
It's sad.

1892
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:26,310
I know there was a- There was like a mini- Oh, there it is.

1893
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,290
Is it still love 39?

1894
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:31,230
Or is it correlate to what- No, it is still love 39.

1895
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:31,710
That's good.

1896
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:34,090
All right, this is time to train.

1897
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,770
All right, that's good.

1898
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:39,110
So I can actually do these objectives now.

1899
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:40,730
All right, let's see.

1900
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:45,750
Achieve dramatic success with a- Achieve- What is battle art chain, guys?

1901
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:49,750
I don't remember what battle art chain is because it doesn't tell me either.

1902
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,690
All right, battle art chain.

1903
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:56,310
Uh, defeat 100 foes with sword.

1904
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:58,310
I will never talk to these people again.

1905
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:01,070
I don't know.

1906
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,530
Thanks, guys.

1907
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,110
Thanks.

1908
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:09,090
Oh, use a battle art when it's blue.

1909
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:10,870
Oh, with the generals.

1910
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:11,850
Okay, I get it.

1911
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:12,290
I know.

1912
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:16,950
All right, you defeat 50 enemies with a staff.

1913
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:20,070
Okay, this last thing is so hard.

1914
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,430
Using a- This one is hard.

1915
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:23,850
Okay.

1916
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,890
Uh, do I have like good ones?

1917
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:29,050
Oh my god, I hate them.

1918
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,330
I hate them.

1919
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,270
Okay.

1920
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:39,010
Uh, I guess I'll use- Do I have anything with- I don't want to romance him.

1921
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,050
He's too old.

1922
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:41,610
He's like a grandpa.

1923
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:43,570
I feel awkward about that.

1924
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:48,350
Nah, that's fine.

1925
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:49,550
We don't need grandpa.

1926
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:53,410
That- Have I ever completed Yuan Shao's shit?

1927
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:56,030
Is that the only Yuan Shao thing I need to do?

1928
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:57,010
Okay.

1929
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:58,910
We're fully charged.

1930
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,810
Okay, fully charged strong attacks.

1931
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:01,270
Okay.

1932
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:03,570
Hot, uh, okay.

1933
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:04,430
Oh, nice.

1934
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:05,950
Okay, strong attack.

1935
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:06,590
We can do this.

1936
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:13,980
He's an awesome grab- Look, we have a lot of choices, okay?

1937
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,400
So I can- I can actually pick and choose.

1938
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:22,860
I- I- So it's fine.

1939
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,040
I can actually pick and choose.

1940
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,700
Okay, nice.

1941
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,420
Wait, there's someone behind me.

1942
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:35,960
There's someone behind me, isn't there?

1943
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,720
Actually- Oh, shit.

1944
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,100
That's a Liga.

1945
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:45,800
Boom!

1946
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,140
Nice.

1947
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,400
All right, let's get rid of him.

1948
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,740
Jesus Christ.

1949
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,960
Stop trying to kill me!

1950
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,680
It don't matter!

1951
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,860
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1952
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,060
Oh my god, please.

1953
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,560
I'm trying to kill this one guy right now.

1954
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,100
You're not that important!

1955
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,020
Jesus Christ.

1956
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,200
This guy is so annoying.

1957
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,280
He has too much HP.

1958
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,520
Boom!

1959
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,120
Only 451, really?

1960
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,420
I thought you were doing more!

1961
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,080
All right.

1962
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:39,780
Goodbye.

1963
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,260
Jesus, this guy was so strong.

1964
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,500
The enemy officer.

1965
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,880
For no reason.

1966
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,940
All right, now I can.

1967
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,720
Oh, shit.

1968
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,460
Please, let me use my attack!

1969
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:56,660
I can't complete this!

1970
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,440
Oh my god!

1971
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,500
I can't complete this one thing I wanted to do.

1972
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:03,940
All right.

1973
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,420
Okay, now I'll do the thing.

1974
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,120
This is not fair.

1975
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:11,900
All right.

1976
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:13,940
I give up.

1977
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,220
I give up.

1978
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,440
Fuck it.

1979
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:20,580
This guy has been annoying me.

1980
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:21,700
Fuck this.

1981
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,280
I'm just gonna kill him fast.

1982
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,040
This guy has been so annoying.

1983
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:30,740
He doesn't deserve it.

1984
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,660
The rest of the people, I don't need a romance.

1985
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,080
All right.

1986
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,880
Jesus Christ.

1987
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:43,960
Get out of here!

1988
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,060
Get out of here!

1989
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,540
Try and kill this one guy!

1990
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,280
What the fuck?

1991
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,960
What the fuck?

1992
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,360
Oh my god.

1993
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,000
I'm in a corner.

1994
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:55,980
Guys, I'm in a corner.

1995
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,260
Okay.

1996
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,420
That's fine.

1997
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,920
Shoot the arrow on my end.

1998
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,020
Arch-dragons, I believe.

1999
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:06,680
Okay.

2000
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:07,560
One down.

2001
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,440
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2002
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:11,840
Where is he?

2003
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,080
What the fuck?

2004
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,400
What's he gonna do?

2005
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,100
Oh, shit!

2006
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,100
That's what he's gonna do.

2007
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,040
Oh my god!

2008
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:18,980
You just...

2009
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,060
You guys just all died.

2010
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:21,880
Whoops!

2011
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:23,420
Oh.

2012
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,380
Oh, you guys are all dead.

2013
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:25,820
Sorry.

2014
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,760
Oh my god.

2015
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,060
Jesus, please!

2016
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:33,780
Stop!

2017
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,720
Please!

2018
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,580
Oh my god, the big fucking...

2019
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,100
I'm trying to kill him!

2020
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,480
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2021
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,280
Nice.

2022
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:50,600
Parried.

2023
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,220
Win never betrays me!

2024
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,020
Jesus.

2025
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,340
Okay, all of these officers are like so...

2026
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:02,680
So tanky, too.

2027
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:03,640
That's the worst part.

2028
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,760
They're all so tanky.

2029
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,580
Oh, they're all advancing!

2030
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:14,620
Nice.

2031
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,860
Oh my god, this is my last raid, too.

2032
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:19,580
Win!

2033
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,480
Get hit!

2034
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,260
Get win!

2035
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:27,820
Hey, nice.

2036
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,700
I just hate how tanky they all are.

2037
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:36,060
They're all so tanky, so it takes like fucking forever to kill them.

2038
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,280
Let's get serious.

2039
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:39,920
Oh my...

2040
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,360
That's it!

2041
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,040
Falling back.

2042
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:41,820
I'm mad!

2043
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,340
Sometimes I couldn't be of more assistance.

2044
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,560
I'm mad now!

2045
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,520
I'm mad!

2046
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,260
Bear witness to my power.

2047
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:51,660
Bear witness to my power.

2048
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:51,700
Bear witness to my power.

2049
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,840
I'm so mad!

2050
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,800
Am I gonna reach them?

2051
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,260
I...

2052
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,680
I don't even know if I reached them.

2053
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,200
That's it.

2054
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,100
You're taught this!

2055
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:04,580
Wait.

2056
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:05,500
It's dual time.

2057
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,280
You'll keep me amused, I hope.

2058
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,220
It's dual time.

2059
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,140
Thank god.

2060
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,360
Thank fucking god.

2061
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,780
I was so done.

2062
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,620
Thank god.

2063
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:18,840
Good.

2064
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,840
You can't kill me if you're stuck in the wind.

2065
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:25,960
That's fucking right.

2066
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,580
Oh, shit.

2067
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:29,780
Oh, shit.

2068
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,420
I think I hit.

2069
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,080
That's too busy trying to...

2070
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,740
Trying to call the wind.

2071
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,080
I'm gonna fight back.

2072
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,640
The enemy officer is undefeated.

2073
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:40,860
Okay.

2074
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,420
You must push harder.

2075
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,020
Alright, nice.

2076
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,260
I got like...

2077
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,620
I don't have to deal with that.

2078
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:51,020
Okay.

2079
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,220
Jesus Christ.

2080
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,200
Did he just kick me?

2081
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,260
What's wrong with you?

2082
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,780
Use your fucking weapon!

2083
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,000
Time to act.

2084
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,600
Oh my god, how is he still...

2085
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:08,380
Get out!

2086
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,160
Oh my god!

2087
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:12,360
Stop!

2088
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,540
It's a 1v1!

2089
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,220
Respect a 1v1!

2090
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,700
That's what you get for not respecting.

2091
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,920
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2092
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,140
Nice.

2093
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,040
Jesus.

2094
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,880
These guys are all so fucking tanky.

2095
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,620
I had to fight like 10 of them.

2096
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,080
Alright.

2097
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,800
How good I am!

2098
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,060
I don't even level up from that?

2099
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,020
Are you serious?

2100
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,100
Okay, I thought I would level up.

2101
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,240
From, like, the amount of shit I just did?

2102
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,440
Okay, we're strong attack using Pado.

2103
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,260
Okay, I still need to do the Pado thing.

2104
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:03,320
Pado?

2105
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:03,980
Pado?

2106
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,180
Nice.

2107
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,480
I got two extra guards.

2108
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:14,810
All right.

2109
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:17,370
Okay.

2110
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:34,550
Is this where I have to go?

2111
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:40,930
Tao Tao's first forces versus Yuan Shao.

2112
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:41,770
Where's the other?

2113
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:45,450
Wait, don't I have another one?

2114
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:46,750
Is that it?

2115
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:50,190
Is that the only one I have?

2116
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,370
Pado Yang province.

2117
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,270
I guess that's the only one I have.

2118
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:56,730
All right.

2119
01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:00,850
It says Lu Bei, but I'm pretty sure this just read...

2120
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:03,310
This was called Tao Tao right here.

2121
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:06,150
All right, this time I can use...

2122
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,930
I can use the skysplitter this time.

2123
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:12,770
Then I have Guan Yun by my side.

2124
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:14,430
Nothing can stop me.

2125
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,280
Yeah, but then why do you say Bracket...

2126
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,560
Bracket...

2127
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:22,880
Lu...

2128
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,500
Lu Bei?

2129
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,060
All right.

2130
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:35,120
Yun Shao has moved his army separate from He Bei with the intention of subjugating to Lord Tao Tao and claiming the land for himself.

2131
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,640
And they plan on starting with Baima Castle.

2132
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,580
The army surrounded the place and they're practically clamping...

2133
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,640
Oh my god.

2134
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,740
That is a lot.

2135
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:46,580
That's why we'll take out the commander, Yang Ling.

2136
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,520
Protecting Baima will assure our victory right at the onset.

2137
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,980
We're obviously done for.

2138
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:52,780
We lose Xiao Xiao.

2139
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,840
So this plan turns that logic on its head.

2140
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,500
Lord Xiao Xiao will be acting as a decoy, drawing Yang Li away...

2141
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,180
away from the castle towards Yang Jing.

2142
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:07,220
At the encircling breaks, a detachment will come cut down Yang Ling.

2143
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:10,920
I suggest Yang Liao and Lord Guan Yu are the right men for the job.

2144
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:11,740
Understood.

2145
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,640
I shall commit the totality of my strength to the task.

2146
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,800
I shall use this battle to repay the hospitality Lord Tao Tao has shown me.

2147
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,560
Even spread thin, the enemy has overwhelming numbers in Baima.

2148
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,120
A surprise attack will work well to willow them down.

2149
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:33,280
But to keep Yuan Xiao's forces around the castle unaware, we'll have to dispose of any foes on the road without most haste.

2150
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,400
To ensure successful ambush, we must also assist.

2151
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,900
Yang Jing with considerable forces.

2152
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:43,740
To pull this off on both fronts, our reinforcements must be accurate and adaptable.

2153
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:44,740
Alright.

2154
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,640
You can leave it to me.

2155
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,180
This is the extent of our strategy.

2156
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,420
Lord Tao Tao, I will return the floor to you.

2157
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:55,180
Indeed, the battle against Yuan Xiao has only just begun.

2158
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:58,360
We must start off strong to gain and maintain the upper hand.

2159
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,220
I'm ready to put my life on the line to win this battle.

2160
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:02,980
I hope I can count all of you...

2161
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:03,780
Oh yes, nice.

2162
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,140
That's right.

2163
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,520
I have Guan Yun by my side.

2164
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,880
I have the God of War now.

2165
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,400
Nothing can stop me.

2166
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:14,580
Alright.

2167
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:15,960
Get my force in here.

2168
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,440
And if Tao Tao unfortunately dies, so be it.

2169
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,000
Surely it was just destiny, right?

2170
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:24,600
Wait, what?

2171
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,000
Oh, yo, you're not getting away.

2172
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:33,700
What are you gonna do?

2173
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,660
Run away with your fucking legs?

2174
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:37,060
That's right.

2175
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,080
I have a horse.

2176
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,680
You can't get away from me.

2177
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,320
You can form the main force of our position.

2178
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,780
We will lose the advantage.

2179
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:45,580
That's right.

2180
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,120
Quickly, pursue them.

2181
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,680
We will keep the enemy at bay.

2182
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,000
That's right.

2183
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:53,180
You thought you can get away.

2184
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,920
You have legs.

2185
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,760
I have a horse.

2186
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,920
Who's level 20.

2187
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:03,800
Oh my God.

2188
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,500
Jesus Christ.

2189
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,020
Alright.

2190
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,000
That was easy.

2191
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:12,020
Okay, one more.

2192
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,260
Whoops.

2193
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,180
Alright, there you go.

2194
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:19,640
He's dead.

2195
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:21,560
There we go, guys.

2196
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:22,520
Look at that.

2197
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,980
It was just that easy.

2198
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:25,520
Okay, I...

2199
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,740
Literally, it was that easy.

2200
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:31,440
Alright, see?

2201
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,060
Look at that.

2202
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:37,580
He tried to run without a horse.

2203
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:39,620
So foolish.

2204
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,200
Let's go!

2205
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,000
Here's our chance.

2206
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,980
Take the enemy by surprise.

2207
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,160
That's right.

2208
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,540
They'll never expect this.

2209
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:55,200
Forces lies in their inexhaustible numbers.

2210
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:55,820
Woo!

2211
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,040
They seem to be pouring out from the fort in an endless stream.

2212
01:32:59,080 --> 01:32:59,680
Wait, are they all dead?

2213
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:03,400
We should first focus our efforts on taking the fort.

2214
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,500
That will force them to change their strategy.

2215
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,820
Wait, these are all weak-ass generalists.

2216
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:10,460
What the fuck?

2217
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,900
My enemy officer advance has been defeated.

2218
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,420
They're all so weak.

2219
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,100
They're actually all so weak.

2220
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:16,640
Look at them.

2221
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,180
They're like jello.

2222
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,480
Allied forces are marching to our aid.

2223
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:22,660
This will be enough to break the siege.

2224
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:23,780
Stand strong.

2225
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,360
They're like all jello.

2226
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:25,640
The victory is imminent.

2227
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,040
Can't believe this.

2228
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,560
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2229
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,740
You guys are all jello.

2230
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:32,740
I'm an officer.

2231
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:34,320
Oh shit.

2232
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,880
We're on our way out of a tight spot.

2233
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,660
Don't let up now.

2234
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,220
Lloyd's out sounds renowned.

2235
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:40,980
Don't worry.

2236
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:41,780
What the fuck?

2237
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,580
Just look at the size of the force they've sent after him.

2238
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,300
You think you can get away?

2239
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,620
Many of their soldiers here.

2240
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:51,320
You think you can get away?

2241
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,100
That's fucking right.

2242
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,560
Is to do all that we can to protect...

2243
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,380
Get out of here.

2244
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,980
You thought those shields are gonna do anything?

2245
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,320
A great debt of gratitude.

2246
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,080
This battle is my chance to end with my blade.

2247
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,160
Get out of here.

2248
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,020
This is the fate of all who oppose me.

2249
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:20,540
I did it.

2250
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:21,680
I did a chain.

2251
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,540
Everybody's dead, but I did it.

2252
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,280
Oh wait, I should get over.

2253
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:33,540
Wait, somebody's inside.

2254
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:34,640
Wait, how did they get inside?

2255
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,760
Wait, how the fuck did they get inside?

2256
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:37,600
Get out of here!

2257
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,680
You're not supposed to be inside!

2258
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:40,980
Get out!

2259
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,260
Wait, what?

2260
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:49,480
We are providing aid in this battle in accordance with our pledge to the people of the north.

2261
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:49,860
Huh?

2262
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:59,740
However, seeing as Cao Cao is loyal to the Han court, we have no objections to taking his life.

2263
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,180
What?

2264
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,200
Wait.

2265
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:07,580
Wait, he's me!

2266
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,700
Hey, what the fuck?

2267
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,080
Oh, no.

2268
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,740
Wait, but I have to kill him!

2269
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,620
Oh, don't worry.

2270
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,800
Cao Cao will be okay, right?

2271
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,700
Guys, do you think Cao Cao will be...

2272
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,020
Really?

2273
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:24,860
Who is that?

2274
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:25,900
Is that the shadow?

2275
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:33,340
Oh my god, is that shadow to my Sonic?

2276
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,940
This is not fair.

2277
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:37,900
I have to kill him.

2278
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,900
Oh my god, he is shadow.

2279
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:56,020
Oh my god.

2280
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:57,020
Oh my god.

2281
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:05,020
Do you not know who you are or from where you hail, but you seem to be driven by a strong conviction.

2282
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:07,060
Oh my god.

2283
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:09,540
Your power alone is insufficient for a comeback.

2284
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,460
Oh my god, it is shadow!

2285
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,440
Not Toki versus...

2286
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,700
Oh my god, more like silver.

2287
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,240
Wait, is that a shadow or silver?

2288
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:18,260
Oh my god, silver.

2289
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,040
Get out of here!

2290
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:28,000
That's right!

2291
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,140
Wait, okay.

2292
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,440
I should change weapons.

2293
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:32,980
Alright.

2294
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,220
Wait, did I finish it?

2295
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:35,720
Sorry.

2296
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,200
Sorry.

2297
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,120
Sorry, silver.

2298
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:38,140
Let me...

2299
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,600
This is much more important.

2300
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,600
I need to figure out if I need to keep using this.

2301
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:43,340
Okay, I do.

2302
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:43,740
Okay.

2303
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:44,760
Alright, don't worry.

2304
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:45,420
I'm still here.

2305
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,480
Sorry, I had to figure out if I could still use this.

2306
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:53,560
Alright, nice.

2307
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:56,700
Bye.

2308
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:03,300
Oh my god, I got extreme musu!

2309
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,820
Sorry, I had to check my to-do list.

2310
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,880
I couldn't finish up.

2311
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,020
This is the fate of all you oppose me.

2312
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:14,600
Alright.

2313
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:15,880
Stay busy.

2314
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,520
I shall put an end to you with my intellect.

2315
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,100
That's fucking right.

2316
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:23,480
Swirl!

2317
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,120
Oh my god.

2318
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:28,880
Wrong way.

2319
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:29,540
Wrong way.

2320
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:30,740
Ha ha ha ha.

2321
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,100
Come on, you're one-hit!

2322
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:39,620
Yes!

2323
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,280
That's fucking right.

2324
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,120
Get out!

2325
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:45,560
Get out!

2326
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:46,160
Shadow!

2327
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:47,940
Has been defeated.

2328
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,800
Of the sacred bird, Luan.

2329
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:51,540
Good.

2330
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:53,020
Alright, we did it.

2331
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,120
Yes.

2332
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,380
You must be.

2333
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:57,640
It's me.

2334
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:58,900
Let's go.

2335
01:37:59,180 --> 01:37:59,700
It's me.

2336
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:00,420
Yes.

2337
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:01,180
It's me.

2338
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:01,760
Brutal.

2339
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,200
I don't know how much more I can take.

2340
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:04,960
Alright, it's fine.

2341
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:05,720
He doesn't matter.

2342
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:06,200
Hmm.

2343
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,960
We should stop here to assess the situation.

2344
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,600
I can't hold on much longer.

2345
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,000
Wait, ready to charge?

2346
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:14,460
We need a way through.

2347
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,960
Let's start the advance.

2348
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:19,020
Who is ready?

2349
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:20,580
Bro, I...

2350
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:23,320
There's so many people I have to worry about!

2351
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:25,700
Let's start the advance.

2352
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:25,760
Let's start the advance.

2353
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,400
I have to go back?

2354
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:31,380
I have to go back.

2355
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:32,980
I went the wrong way.

2356
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,240
I got confused!

2357
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,560
How was I supposed to know?

2358
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,020
I got confused!

2359
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,180
Jesus Christ.

2360
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:53,200
Alright, sound, sound.

2361
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:53,600
Charge!

2362
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:55,800
Do your thing!

2363
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,480
Wait, you didn't even need me there!

2364
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:00,580
Jesus Christ, you didn't even need me there!

2365
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,920
What do you mean capture it in our back?

2366
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,440
I just captured this!

2367
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:16,200
Okay, whoops, I accidentally used my musu again.

2368
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,500
That's my bad.

2369
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,080
Alright.

2370
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:26,420
Can't the enemy do better than that?

2371
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,460
I'm so confused.

2372
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,140
There's so many people I have to fight.

2373
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:32,260
Oh!

2374
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,920
There's too many places!

2375
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,340
There's too many places!

2376
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,880
Who died?

2377
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,480
Oh, no.

2378
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,200
Oh, no.

2379
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,020
Please!

2380
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:50,680
Everyone, stop dying!

2381
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:52,660
Please!

2382
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,020
I need you all to stop dying!

2383
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,580
Alright, that's fine.

2384
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:08,920
All right.

2385
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:13,580
It's fine.

2386
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,580
Everything is fine.

2387
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:21,440
All right, we got this guy out of the way.

2388
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:22,660
Get out of here.

2389
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,160
All right.

2390
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,540
It's fine.

2391
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:32,520
Everything is fine.

2392
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,060
There we go.

2393
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,300
He's dead, too.

2394
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:37,680
Resistance has been defeated.

2395
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:40,120
Let's go.

2396
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:40,780
Oh, no.

2397
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:41,360
I'll come back.

2398
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,060
I'm going back and forth.

2399
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,040
I don't know where to go.

2400
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,380
There's too many.

2401
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:49,920
Too many fights.

2402
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:51,100
One at a time.

2403
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:51,840
Please.

2404
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,160
One at a time, everybody.

2405
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:58,140
Oops.

2406
01:40:58,900 --> 01:40:59,880
I need to fall back.

2407
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,280
I need everybody to chill right now.

2408
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,380
Just the right time.

2409
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,160
Quickly.

2410
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,420
Lend us a hand.

2411
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:08,500
All right.

2412
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,140
I'm starting to get fatigued.

2413
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:11,340
Who is?

2414
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,920
I've been waiting for this.

2415
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,000
Jesus Christ.

2416
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:17,120
Let's go.

2417
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:17,140
To the right time...

2418
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,620
Oh my God.

2419
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:20,680
lower left base.

2420
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:21,360
Guys!

2421
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,160
There's so many.

2422
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,120
We should attack now.

2423
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:26,240
We should attack now.

2424
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,220
We should attack now!

2425
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:29,660
Oh my God.

2426
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,620
The enemy officer.

2427
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:33,040
Has been defeated.

2428
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,020
What do you mean, we should attack now?

2429
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:35,900
Wait for me!

2430
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,120
Okay.

2431
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,040
All right.

2432
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,500
Wait for me, Sansa!

2433
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:52,700
It's not time yet!

2434
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:57,760
I'm still fighting!

2435
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,520
All right, nice.

2436
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:01,380
That's good.

2437
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:01,920
That's good.

2438
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,820
That kills more time for me.

2439
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,000
Who?

2440
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,340
Who are you?

2441
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,160
All right.

2442
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,880
What do you mean you're one of his greatest?

2443
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,980
Who are you?

2444
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,580
Never even heard of you in my life!

2445
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:27,960
If you truly are his greatest warrior, you'd have a custom cosmetic.

2446
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:30,260
I can't believe this.

2447
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,280
That's fucking right.

2448
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:31,780
The enemy is not doing well.

2449
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:32,580
Has been defeated.

2450
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,360
Keep it going.

2451
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,220
I have to be arrested.

2452
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:38,280
Let's go.

2453
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,900
How can this be?

2454
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,380
Oh, we did it.

2455
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,340
It's fine.

2456
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:55,580
I can't believe we managed to drive back such a large force.

2457
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:57,260
We may be outnumbered.

2458
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,260
Coming back, guys.

2459
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,120
Coming back!

2460
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,620
I'm here, everyone!

2461
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,060
I'm here!

2462
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,800
Don't die!

2463
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:06,780
Take your brain!

2464
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:11,880
All right.

2465
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,080
Did I finish?

2466
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:13,460
Sorry.

2467
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,580
This is much more important than I finish.

2468
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:16,460
All right.

2469
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:17,540
We're almost there.

2470
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:22,980
Nice.

2471
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:27,180
Our next target will likely be the enemy forces at Yem-jin.

2472
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,060
Go, Guan Yu, go!

2473
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:35,120
That's right!

2474
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,580
With all your might, Guan Yu!

2475
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,640
Jesus Christ!

2476
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:40,760
Oh, my God!

2477
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,860
There's fucking chariots everywhere again!

2478
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:43,860
Oh, man!

2479
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:51,480
Normally, one seeks to overcome their opponent on the battlefield through superior resources.

2480
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,200
You, on the other hand...

2481
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:54,940
Okay, nice.

2482
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:00,140
Jesus, I'm killing the enemies.

2483
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,020
I'm just doing them non-stop right now.

2484
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,720
A thousand!

2485
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:11,160
Yeah, I know I should adjust the skills, but like, I don't care.

2486
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:15,060
I'm just literally my, like, object- oh my god.

2487
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,080
The fucking chariots.

2488
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:19,480
Oh my god.

2489
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,460
The STUPID CHARIOTS!

2490
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,020
Oh my god, where are they?

2491
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,660
Where is the chariots?

2492
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,620
I'm trying to find the chariots!

2493
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:30,640
Where are they?

2494
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,360
Oh my god, this is- this is fucked up.

2495
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,860
This is actually fucked up.

2496
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,120
I can't- this is so fucked up.

2497
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,660
This is so fucked up cuz I don't know where they are.

2498
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,600
This is so fucked up.

2499
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:47,660
Where- I'm lagging cuz I don't know where the chariots are!

2500
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,640
Like, I can't tell!

2501
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:58,360
I- Why is the chariots?

2502
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,920
There's too many!

2503
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,840
Where is this- OH MY GOD!

2504
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:09,980
My chariots can't handle it!

2505
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:11,140
I can't handle it!

2506
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:13,680
I can't- I'm trying so hard!

2507
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:21,920
To find- I can't- I can't- I can't- I can't- I can't- it's like- where- there's so many going on!

2508
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,560
It's actually- it's actually impossible!

2509
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,260
Guan Yun!

2510
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,200
I can't handle it.

2511
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:33,040
You gotta find- you gotta find the chariots for me, Caien!

2512
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,220
You gotta find it!

2513
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,780
Okay, there we go!

2514
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:38,440
I- Awesome!

2515
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,000
This is the one you and gouf to destroy the chariots!

2516
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:44,720
Holy shit!

2517
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:50,760
My game was like- where- bahy g Game couldn't handle it either.

2518
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:53,120
That's crazy.

2519
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:01,260
Bro, my game wasn't getting fucked up there.

2520
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,920
He was so confused.

2521
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:09,860
He also was like, where the fuck is the Chariot?

2522
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:17,420
There's no way I don't defeat 300 enemies from here.

2523
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:26,800
Oh my god!

2524
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:29,120
That was fast.

2525
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,120
Jesus, 400?!

2526
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:36,800
Get out of here!

2527
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:37,600
Alright.

2528
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:39,320
There we go.

2529
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:41,140
Okay, sure.

2530
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,840
I mean, he's so cool.

2531
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,460
Any who believe themselves worthy may test their might against me.

2532
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,500
That's actually crazy, though.

2533
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,820
I was like, where is... I can't see anything.

2534
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:59,460
There were so many people on my screen.

2535
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:02,520
Even my PC was like, whoa, calm down.

2536
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,680
Calm the fuck down.

2537
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:04,980
What?

2538
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:07,980
What?

2539
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:09,140
What?

2540
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,560
What?

2541
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:14,600
What?

2542
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:18,540
Why did it happen like this?

2543
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,360
We fucking did it.

2544
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:25,840
This is a new benchmark game.

2545
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:31,080
I think they put like, 6,000 people in that army right there.

2546
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:37,140
I was like, what if the... the chariot was like, five gigabytes each.

2547
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:45,740
I could foresee losing either Yanliang or Wenchou, but for both to have been slain.

2548
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:48,540
You fought well this time, Cao Cao.

2549
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,340
But, this brings you no closer to matching our might.

2550
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:56,300
In the end, there can only be one victor.

2551
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:58,080
And that will be me!

2552
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:01,060
This encounter is 50 chariots.

2553
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,340
Winning the first battle bodes very well for our side.

2554
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:08,040
But overcoming their greater numbers will prove to be difficult.

2555
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:11,540
This is not where we will strike the final blow.

2556
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,860
But we killed so many!

2557
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:16,120
Why are we walking away?

2558
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,040
We killed so many!

2559
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:20,380
I did so much there!

2560
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:22,180
How are we running away?

2561
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,380
Nice.

2562
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:28,920
Alright, we got that.

2563
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:31,400
We got that.

2564
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:34,160
Nice.

2565
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:34,240
Nice.

2566
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:39,780
I know we got another one that was close too.

2567
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:41,960
Oh yeah, we almost got that.

2568
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,640
We needed 200.

2569
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,140
Uh, 200 and...

2570
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:48,940
Yeah, that was nice.

2571
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:52,260
Alright, we'll get that.

2572
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:01,190
The homework never ends.

2573
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,460
This was a great victory.

2574
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:12,680
And it is owed to your wisdom and strength.

2575
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:14,780
Ice Leung is strong?

2576
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:16,360
Oh, is that what my skill moves?

2577
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,580
But it is not yet over, my lord.

2578
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,860
Alright, I'll equip that next.

2579
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:22,960
Thanks.

2580
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,700
Okay, but is it better than Wen though?

2581
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,800
It looks like Yuan Shao is continuing his march south.

2582
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,640
They will overrun us if we do not intercept them.

2583
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:39,440
To defeat a large army, we must first take advantage of the terrain.

2584
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,260
It's better than Wen?

2585
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,780
We will draw back the front line to Grandu.

2586
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,800
Wen has been with...

2587
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,440
Wen helped us beat LuPu.

2588
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:53,740
Wen has never let me down.

2589
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:59,240
Okay, but Wen helped me beat LuPu.

2590
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,440
You can't say it's not that good if I beat LuPu with it.

2591
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,000
Did someone call for me?

2592
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,560
Yeah, Wen has Wen in it.

2593
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:09,460
Checkmate.

2594
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:09,480
Wait.

2595
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:16,310
Hello?

2596
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:17,310
Who's there?

2597
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:18,130
Shadow?

2598
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:27,710
Zuluwan, it's been too long.

2599
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:29,790
So it really was you.

2600
01:50:30,330 --> 01:50:32,290
I never would have expected this.

2601
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:35,210
But why didn't you tell me where you were?

2602
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:37,950
Who are you?

2603
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:40,750
Shadow, that you?

2604
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:42,430
What are you saying, Zuluwan?

2605
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:44,230
Wait, is that the little kid?

2606
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:47,110
You've forgotten who I am.

2607
01:50:47,110 --> 01:50:49,250
Is he a big boy now?

2608
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:51,710
You won't answer?

2609
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:54,170
Or maybe you can't.

2610
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:56,510
Then it's true.

2611
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:59,570
You really have forgotten everything.

2612
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,090
You mean you weren't a little boy?

2613
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:04,210
I suppose I should have known.

2614
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:12,210
If you had your memories, you wouldn't have allied yourself with Tsao Tsao, the usurper of the Han.

2615
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:19,310
You have forgotten your mission, your ideals, and the promises you made.

2616
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:20,230
People grow up.

2617
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:22,110
And now you're flown aimlessly through.

2618
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:22,710
And now you're flown aimlessly through.

2619
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:30,690
Yet even so, you are unable to escape your fate as a guardian of peace.

2620
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:32,170
Okay, you were trying to kill.

2621
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:36,610
You submit to a higher power and act as a weapon for them.

2622
01:51:37,370 --> 01:51:49,070
Just as you did as a guardian of peace.

2623
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:49,990
In the end?

2624
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:54,340
Shadow peace.

2625
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:54,360
Shadow peace.

2626
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:57,200
Did she tell you to forget everything and live on?

2627
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:58,780
Or...

2628
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:01,200
To pursue true peace?

2629
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:05,780
I can't remember.

2630
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:10,040
If you can't remember, then let me remind you.

2631
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,860
Juha is dead.

2632
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:16,320
You were there when it happened.

2633
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:17,500
No!

2634
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:22,700
Now you're living a carefree life, free from any memory of her death.

2635
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:23,780
No, that's not true!

2636
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:24,500
I see her!

2637
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:25,580
She's there right now!

2638
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:30,600
Every time the doctor lights the incense, I see her.

2639
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:33,860
Oh, I buried the memory deep inside me.

2640
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,360
I like trauma forgot.

2641
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,360
Are you crying?

2642
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:40,740
Oh...

2643
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,080
...

2644
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:43,080
Oh...

2645
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:43,500
Go...

2646
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:45,360
...ZiLuan...

2647
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,280
...down your own path?

2648
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:53,000
The accident wasn't...

2649
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,460
Literally the accident wasn't your fault.

2650
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,200
Are you crying?

2651
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:58,760
NOOOOO!

2652
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:00,740
I...

2653
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:01,660
...fine.

2654
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:05,560
I trauma forgot for a reason!

2655
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,440
He really is cel-

2656
01:53:18,820 --> 01:53:20,800
Can I just carry her out?

2657
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:26,110
Just do CPR.

2658
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:30,370
She just breathed too much smoke guys.

2659
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,840
I buried that trauma deep inside me.

2660
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,160
Why would he remind me of this?

2661
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,060
Wait, who dragged me out though?

2662
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:02,910
What the fuck?

2663
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,030
Yeah, where is she?

2664
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:11,970
Who dragged me out?

2665
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:27,460
It is him!

2666
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,320
Bye long!

2667
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,460
Maybe I was being foolish.

2668
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:35,220
Desperately clinging to a past that will never return.

2669
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:39,120
Wait, then what the fuck was that little boy I was talking to this entire time?

2670
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:44,800
If you insist on following the Han and allied with Tsao...

2671
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,260
What the fuck was I talking to?

2672
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:51,160
I will not hesitate to stand against you once more.

2673
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:51,920
He was alive.

2674
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:57,860
You must remember who the Han are to us.

2675
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:05,200
Well, the point may be moot if Tsao Tsao is crushed by Yuan Shi.

2676
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:07,000
Tsao in the next battle.

2677
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,160
I will- Oh my god.

2678
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:10,660
I look forward to seeing him struggle.

2679
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,300
I am crazy.

2680
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,060
I was talking to my inner ghost this entire time.

2681
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:23,350
It's not that child?

2682
01:55:23,570 --> 01:55:24,370
Is that not him?

2683
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:26,110
Is Bai Lang not the child?

2684
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:31,970
I thought Bai Lang was the child.

2685
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:34,810
I heard something's about to happen in Guan Du.

2686
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:37,050
And I do not like the sound of that.

2687
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:38,370
That's not him?

2688
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,480
I was gonna say, I thought that was the- I thought Bai Lang was the child.

2689
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:05,760
I knew it!

2690
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:06,640
I knew it!

2691
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,320
I knew I was crazy!

2692
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:09,800
I knew I was- it's frantic.

2693
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:15,120
I knew there shouldn't have been more than one voice in my head.

2694
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:23,260
I believe now is the time for you to face the real Chu-ha.

2695
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:29,580
You should figure out what it was that all of you staked your lives to accomplish.

2696
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,580
You, Chu-ha, Bai Luan.

2697
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,900
No, Bai Luan is the child.

2698
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,580
How would I do that?

2699
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:42,840
Don't you think you're underestimating me, Ziluan?

2700
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,240
I think you ought to place a little more faith in me.

2701
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:54,360
The key to unlocking your past is most likely the incense used by the Guardians of Peace.

2702
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:56,420
The incense?

2703
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:58,440
How do you know- wait, how do you know this?

2704
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:03,920
I investigated your village and went through just about every relevant text I could find.

2705
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:08,080
It took a great deal of time.

2706
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:14,080
However, I'm afraid the truth is crueler than you might imagine, Ziluan.

2707
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:17,580
I would understand if you wish to avoid learning the truth.

2708
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:20,180
That, too, is a valid choice.

2709
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:26,240
But, if you do decide you want to unravel your past- Look, it was the good shit, okay?

2710
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,440
Those incenses hit good.

2711
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:33,900
That said, we had best try out the incense first of all.

2712
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:37,980
I will be rather embarrassed if it doesn't help you remember anything.

2713
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,720
It made me talk to my dead ghost girlfriend.

2714
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:49,980
With such an eminent family, Yuan Shao stands out as truly powerful- And then I trauma forgot everything.

2715
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:55,680
The fact that- Oh my god, Destiny- Wait, I can afford this!

2716
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,660
Oh my Dragoon's Destiny EX.

2717
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:02,780
That's when you know it's good.

2718
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:05,320
Wait, I can actually just afford it.

2719
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:05,740
Nice.

2720
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:06,160
Alright.

2721
01:58:09,610 --> 01:58:11,550
Oh my god, the EX means it's good.

2722
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:12,710
I learned that from Pokemon.

2723
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:15,590
When they're Pokemon cards.

2724
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:18,570
Okay, let's see.

2725
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:20,690
We still have not done the tactics.

2726
01:58:21,070 --> 01:58:21,570
Oh my god.

2727
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:23,510
I just never stand on high ground.

2728
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:24,650
I just- I don't know.

2729
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:28,010
I just never go high ground for some reason.

2730
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:33,190
Extra expensive!

2731
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:37,950
Alright, I need to make sure.

2732
01:58:38,830 --> 01:58:39,330
Alright.

2733
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:40,790
Go show them what you're made of.

2734
01:58:46,170 --> 01:58:46,670
Uh...

2735
01:58:46,670 --> 01:58:47,150
Let's see.

2736
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:47,830
Here we go.

2737
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:58,670
Oh yeah, I should- Okay, since- I should get the- Replace the- Aw, to get rid of my- Gotta get rid of my wind attack.

2738
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:00,310
Sad.

2739
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:01,370
What is this?

2740
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:04,610
Unleash a shockwave of ice.

2741
01:59:04,970 --> 01:59:05,470
Jesus!

2742
01:59:05,790 --> 01:59:10,090
Okay, yeah, that- Oh my- Yeah, see- That seems really good.

2743
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:13,490
It literally takes up my entire sly of stuff.

2744
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:17,130
Ah!

2745
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:18,270
Okay.

2746
01:59:18,710 --> 01:59:19,450
I'll go to the village.

2747
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:41,280
Yeah, but if I have wind in there, I'm gonna just spam wind all the time and never save up for ice.

2748
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,880
My dead girlfriend!

2749
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:44,140
My friend!

2750
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,680
Even when dead, she has killer eye shadow.

2751
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,760
And mascara.

2752
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,340
And were cut down.

2753
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,820
And now, you know.

2754
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:04,420
I am- I am- But a fragment of your memory.

2755
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:07,880
Being dead doesn't mean she won't have time to make herself look pretty.

2756
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:09,820
Born of your deep...

2757
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,030
Painful regret...

2758
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:16,040
Over having survived that day.

2759
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:17,040
Yeah, she gotta say.

2760
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,080
I think...

2761
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,120
I think...

2762
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:19,980
This...

2763
02:00:19,980 --> 02:00:23,740
Will probably be the last time you'll see me.

2764
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:25,820
You...

2765
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:27,540
Do not need me anymore.

2766
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,040
Wait, no!

2767
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,300
No, no, no, no!

2768
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:30,980
Don't go!

2769
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:33,020
Stay with me!

2770
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:34,440
The dreams we share.

2771
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,680
The path we chose.

2772
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:37,700
That fucking meme.

2773
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:38,840
Don't go!

2774
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,000
The hopes that I passed on to you.

2775
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,700
I made my own choices.

2776
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,700
My own decisions.

2777
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:50,880
I lived my life without regrets.

2778
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:56,140
Feeling guilty for our deaths only cheapens our resolve.

2779
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:00,700
So please, do not blame yourself anymore.

2780
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:08,820
From this point on, do not let your desire to atone for your past shape your future.

2781
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:14,040
Instead, be guided by your will to see your choices through.

2782
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:16,740
Now, go forth.

2783
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:20,360
You do not need to look back at us anymore.

2784
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:22,840
What?

2785
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,280
Goodbye.

2786
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:29,060
Watch over me.

2787
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:30,780
Was I...

2788
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:32,960
Filled this hole that you left?

2789
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:34,100
Of course.

2790
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:36,040
I always will.

2791
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:37,580
Ziluan.

2792
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:40,740
Take care of Bailuan for us.

2793
02:01:45,570 --> 02:01:48,250
Like, I haven't ever saw the real Bailuan and I don't...

2794
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:49,370
I don't, like, see...

2795
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:53,230
Alright, so was that the incense talking or was I actually talking to a ghost?

2796
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:55,350
Doctor, did you light up the incense?

2797
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:58,470
And the doctor was like, wait, I haven't light it up yet.

2798
02:01:59,650 --> 02:02:00,170
Good.

2799
02:02:00,670 --> 02:02:02,610
It seems you were able to remember Chima.

2800
02:02:02,610 --> 02:02:02,730
Oh, she did!

2801
02:02:04,270 --> 02:02:06,790
That success is a weight off my mind.

2802
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:08,390
You did well.

2803
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:10,090
I officially pronounced you cured.

2804
02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:11,510
I'm cured?!

2805
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:13,350
What did you do?!

2806
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:15,990
Yes.

2807
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,550
There is nothing more to be done.

2808
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:21,350
You laid up sticks!

2809
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:22,790
That's all you did!

2810
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:28,050
Well, I haven't really decided just yet.

2811
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:30,810
That's sad.

2812
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:34,770
I've always thought of visiting the land where my father studied medicine.

2813
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:37,330
Perhaps now is the time.

2814
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:40,010
As for you, Ziluan...

2815
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:41,210
That would be 100k.

2816
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:41,390
That would be 100k.

2817
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:45,010
He cured my mental illness.

2818
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:48,310
Guys, he cured my schizophrenia.

2819
02:02:48,630 --> 02:02:51,910
I don't see my fucking dead girlfriend anymore.

2820
02:02:52,510 --> 02:02:53,570
Holy shit.

2821
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:57,290
But I still...

2822
02:02:57,290 --> 02:02:58,230
I'll miss you.

2823
02:03:03,370 --> 02:03:06,870
I'll miss you!

2824
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:08,190
Choo!

2825
02:03:08,930 --> 02:03:09,570
Choo!

2826
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:14,450
Our journey has been one of the most rewarding times in my life.

2827
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:17,110
I met so many people.

2828
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:20,850
All fighting to survive this chaotic era.

2829
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:25,430
On second thought, maybe I could linger for a while longer yet.

2830
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:29,310
After all, what better place to fulfill my duty?

2831
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:33,620
Your duty?

2832
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:34,480
Like how?

2833
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,580
I don't have...

2834
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:38,600
Why am I given a choice to say anything?

2835
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,820
It's one choice!

2836
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:47,860
Well, I call it a duty, but it's a humble matter compared to the exploits of someone like yourself.

2837
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,900
It's like, here's the choices you have.

2838
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:51,420
One.

2839
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:57,420
Along with that knowledge, they passed down the ideal of healing the sick and aiding the wounded.

2840
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:03,420
Now that I'm of a certain age, it's my duty to pass that ideal onto someone else.

2841
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:08,420
Just as Chuuha passed her dreams and ideals onto you.

2842
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,220
Which is a roundabout way of asking.

2843
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:14,200
Would you let me travel with you a little while longer?

2844
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:15,740
Oh my god, my doctor wants this.

2845
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:16,480
Can I say...

2846
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,440
I can't even say...

2847
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,700
Okay, I don't understand.

2848
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:21,620
What is there to understand?

2849
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,160
I can't even say no.

2850
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:25,820
Let me accompany you on your adventures.

2851
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:27,240
Just as I have been.

2852
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:28,540
And please...

2853
02:04:29,070 --> 02:04:29,960
Don't make me beg.

2854
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:30,940
Beg.

2855
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:31,360
Now.

2856
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,680
I shall continue to get your service and provide what help I can.

2857
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,920
I thought you wanted to see your father!

2858
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:37,440
Like, not see your father.

2859
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:40,120
I thought you wanted to do what your father wanted you to do.

2860
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:43,980
I can't say no.

2861
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,280
Oh my god.

2862
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:48,640
I don't have a choice.

2863
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:49,820
He must follow me.

2864
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:52,280
I don't understand them.

2865
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:53,260
What about the little kid?

2866
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:58,500
Like, why did I see those little kids?

2867
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,520
One, two, three.

2868
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:12,530
Ultimate Musou is good.

2869
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:14,090
Okay, I'll get that next time.

2870
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:17,450
What did you do, Lord Cao Cao?

2871
02:05:18,170 --> 02:05:19,290
Their numbers...

2872
02:05:19,290 --> 02:05:20,910
What, Kid Toki?

2873
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:21,790
You took your men?

2874
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:27,050
Yuan Shao's army is growing cautious as it nears Guandu.

2875
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:30,930
It appears their loss in Baima has shaken them.

2876
02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:37,330
But with our supplies dwindling, Yuan Shao must know that time is on his side.

2877
02:05:37,330 --> 02:05:38,490
And yet, then...

2878
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,590
Any news from Shu City, Guo Jia?

2879
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:49,690
Lord XunYu says that lords in the vicinity of Shu City are showing signs of revolt.

2880
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:56,050
And there are rumors that Liu Bei was spotted among the leaders of the rebellion.

2881
02:05:56,890 --> 02:05:57,830
Liu Bei?

2882
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:03,230
His majesty has taken a liking to Liu Bei.

2883
02:06:03,850 --> 02:06:07,850
If he comes to the rescue, then his majesty will follow him.

2884
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:09,610
But Liu Bei's on the Emperor's side.

2885
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:13,990
Then it is imperative that we send more troops to put the rebellion down, yes?

2886
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:17,790
Do not be so nervous, Lord Shun-Yu.

2887
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:20,810
Those who lack the heart of a warrior...

2888
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:23,310
Okay, his... I can't say Guad, yeah, seriously.

2889
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:26,330
Because his voice reminds me of...

2890
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:27,570
Uh... Yamalak?

2891
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:28,390
Was it Yamalak?

2892
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:29,550
From Solar Opposites.

2893
02:06:30,410 --> 02:06:33,310
Like the little... the little kid from Solar Opposites.

2894
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:35,250
That fucking brat.

2895
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:41,290
If anyone ever watched that show, he literally sounds like him.

2896
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:43,270
They say Liu Bei is in Shu City.

2897
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:46,930
I wonder if Zhang Fei and the others are all right.

2898
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:50,930
Then we have to go.

2899
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:52,210
Agreed.

2900
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:55,950
But only after we get permission from Lord Cao Cao.

2901
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:58,470
We accepted his help.

2902
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:00,630
So we must thank him properly.

2903
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:04,630
And we need to take custody of Liu Bei's family.

2904
02:07:05,470 --> 02:07:09,130
Once we've settled our affairs here, we'll begin our journey.

2905
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:11,090
Does that sound good to you?

2906
02:07:12,430 --> 02:07:14,550
Okay, I wanna say something really fucked up.

2907
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:16,050
But like...

2908
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:17,450
Ever since...

2909
02:07:17,450 --> 02:07:18,550
I'm gonna say it.

2910
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:19,250
But I think...

2911
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:20,070
Who...

2912
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:22,390
Okay, who's the writer for Community again?

2913
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:23,170
The guy who...

2914
02:07:23,690 --> 02:07:25,710
Okay, this is off topic from Dynasty Warriors.

2915
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:26,770
But...

2916
02:07:26,770 --> 02:07:27,670
What was his name?

2917
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:28,930
Um...

2918
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:30,250
Fuck, the creator of Community.

2919
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:32,290
So...

2920
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:36,290
I think he is an incredibly great...

2921
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,450
Dan Harmon.

2922
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:41,350
I think Dan Harmon is an incredibly great writer.

2923
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:42,910
Um...

2924
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:44,110
Terrible work ethic though.

2925
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:45,450
Terrible work ethic.

2926
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:46,790
And like, might treat his...

2927
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:48,190
Might treat workers pretty poorly.

2928
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:49,230
But...

2929
02:07:49,910 --> 02:07:51,610
But he is a...

2930
02:07:51,610 --> 02:07:53,570
He is a great writer.

2931
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:55,690
And I will say...

2932
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:57,030
That when...

2933
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:58,610
Justin Roiland...

2934
02:07:58,610 --> 02:08:00,570
Wrote shows with him...

2935
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:01,830
Um...

2936
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:02,870
The writing...

2937
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:03,810
Degraded...

2938
02:08:03,810 --> 02:08:04,290
A lot.

2939
02:08:04,490 --> 02:08:06,310
Because it was all based off of like...

2940
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:06,930
His improv.

2941
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:08,490
And then it like...

2942
02:08:08,490 --> 02:08:09,990
It fucked with the plot.

2943
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:11,630
And I think...

2944
02:08:11,630 --> 02:08:12,770
I think when...

2945
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:13,850
When...

2946
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:15,910
Dan Harmon took over...

2947
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:16,810
Solar Opposites.

2948
02:08:17,110 --> 02:08:17,870
And...

2949
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:18,530
Uh...

2950
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:19,750
Like when he...

2951
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:20,250
Like not...

2952
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:21,310
When like...

2953
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:22,930
Justin Roiland got replaced.

2954
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:24,990
I think the shows...

2955
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:25,630
That like...

2956
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:27,190
Dan Harmon was involved in.

2957
02:08:27,470 --> 02:08:27,970
And also...

2958
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:28,830
Solar Opposites.

2959
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:30,730
Got a lot better...

2960
02:08:30,730 --> 02:08:31,490
Plot wise.

2961
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:32,830
Because like...

2962
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:33,430
And like...

2963
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:34,090
Humor wise.

2964
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:36,090
Cause it wasn't just like...

2965
02:08:36,090 --> 02:08:36,710
Random...

2966
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:37,490
Hee hee...

2967
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:37,730
Uh...

2968
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:38,590
Pee pee poo poo...

2969
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:39,330
Humor anymore.

2970
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:43,910
There was more plot...

2971
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:44,810
And like...

2972
02:08:44,810 --> 02:08:45,510
Witty writing.

2973
02:08:45,850 --> 02:08:47,150
But that's my like...

2974
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:47,530
Hot take.

2975
02:08:48,870 --> 02:08:51,310
I think that was my biggest issue.

2976
02:08:51,710 --> 02:08:52,510
Cause that...

2977
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:52,850
They...

2978
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:54,410
Rely too much...

2979
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:55,030
On like...

2980
02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:55,870
Improv...

2981
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:56,430
Humor.

2982
02:08:56,510 --> 02:08:56,770
Like...

2983
02:08:56,770 --> 02:08:57,510
Improv takes.

2984
02:08:58,030 --> 02:08:58,750
Than...

2985
02:08:58,750 --> 02:08:59,350
Um...

2986
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:00,570
Than actual like...

2987
02:09:00,570 --> 02:09:00,910
Writing.

2988
02:09:01,210 --> 02:09:01,790
And like...

2989
02:09:01,790 --> 02:09:02,470
Making shows like...

2990
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:03,130
Witty and stuff.

2991
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:04,730
Um...

2992
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:05,350
Cause like...

2993
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:06,310
Solar Opposites...

2994
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:07,450
Actually got...

2995
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:08,450
A lot better...

2996
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:09,650
In terms of...

2997
02:09:09,650 --> 02:09:10,030
Writing wise.

2998
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:10,530
When it...

2999
02:09:10,530 --> 02:09:11,890
Didn't rely on like...

3000
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:12,810
The improv stuff.

3001
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:14,150
Um...

3002
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:14,930
And also...

3003
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:15,750
I think...

3004
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:17,110
Rick and Morty...

3005
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:17,590
Actually...

3006
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:18,830
Writing wise...

3007
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:19,870
Improved a lot.

3008
02:09:20,150 --> 02:09:21,730
Because it was degrading.

3009
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:23,570
And then it actually got a lot better.

3010
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:24,510
Because Stan Harmon...

3011
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:25,970
Took over...

3012
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:26,310
Like...

3013
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:27,990
The whole writing segment of the show.

3014
02:09:28,450 --> 02:09:28,790
Uh...

3015
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:32,530
Um...

3016
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:33,110
But that's...

3017
02:09:33,110 --> 02:09:33,590
My opinion.

3018
02:09:33,870 --> 02:09:34,030
Yeah.

3019
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:35,630
I think...

3020
02:09:35,630 --> 02:09:36,530
I feel like...

3021
02:09:36,530 --> 02:09:37,070
It got...

3022
02:09:37,070 --> 02:09:37,690
A lot better.

3023
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:41,130
Alright.

3024
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:42,250
Of course.

3025
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,830
Yeah.

3026
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:44,510
Uh...

3027
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:45,150
Once we sell...

3028
02:09:45,150 --> 02:09:45,890
Then we'll begin...

3029
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:46,070
Yeah.

3030
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:47,970
Do you even need to ask?

3031
02:09:48,230 --> 02:09:50,610
Cause I still kept watching Rick and Morty...

3032
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:51,550
Even though like...

3033
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:52,430
The writing got...

3034
02:09:52,430 --> 02:09:52,870
Like...

3035
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:53,150
It...

3036
02:09:53,150 --> 02:09:54,250
Clearly like...

3037
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:54,650
You know...

3038
02:09:54,650 --> 02:09:55,230
It was like...

3039
02:09:55,230 --> 02:09:55,950
Down a little bit.

3040
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:56,670
The humor wise.

3041
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:57,650
But it got a lot better.

3042
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,360
The hundred thousand...

3043
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:06,460
The hundred thousand li march of Guan Yin.

3044
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:07,940
Something's about to happen in Guan Du.

3045
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:08,860
And I do not...

3046
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:09,760
But like...

3047
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:11,320
He's not like...

3048
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:12,220
A great person.

3049
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:13,240
I would not...

3050
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:13,820
Dan Harmon!

3051
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:14,920
Like...

3052
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,460
There's stories of like...

3053
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:16,960
How he...

3054
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,900
Treated people.

3055
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:18,960
So...

3056
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,720
But he's a very talented writer.

3057
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:25,160
He's a different person when he drinks.

3058
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:34,760
This town has gotten...

3059
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,100
I wanna see if there's like...

3060
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:36,860
Any...

3061
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:37,860
Extra areas to go.

3062
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:38,680
I wonder if that's...

3063
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,640
I have anybody in mind.

3064
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,380
Did anyone send me a ye olde super chat?

3065
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:44,720
Well...

3066
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:46,640
Alright...

3067
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:47,400
Oh my god!

3068
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,740
Greetings, Doc Doki!

3069
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:50,740
I heard from the doctor that you regained...

3070
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:51,620
Gained your memories!

3071
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:52,460
Congratulations!

3072
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:54,440
With that case up...

3073
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:57,820
I was sure Master Yuan Ha would take some...

3074
02:10:57,820 --> 02:10:58,920
Time to rest.

3075
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:00,520
But something just isn't right with him.

3076
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:04,500
He seems to fall into a trance to stare into the air at the strangest time.

3077
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:06,860
I went to get some medicine from him the other day.

3078
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:09,640
I brought him the meal of wild vegetables he enjoys.

3079
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:11,760
So much as a reward for the trouble.

3080
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:15,340
But his reaction fell far short of his typical delight.

3081
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:17,640
If Master Yuan Ha is depressed...

3082
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,440
I can't help but worry about him.

3083
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:21,100
What if you try to cheer him up?

3084
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,500
I think that might help.

3085
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:24,540
Please do whatever you can to help him.

3086
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,120
Wait, who's...

3087
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:26,840
Oh, wait.

3088
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:27,820
He's depressed?

3089
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:29,560
Why are you depressed, little boy?

3090
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:33,000
Why are you...

3091
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,080
Is it because we don't use incense anymore?

3092
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:38,440
Yeah, how am I supposed to treat...

3093
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:39,080
Cheer up the little...

3094
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:39,520
The doctor?

3095
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:43,100
Things have gotten so much better around here that you can hardly recognize the place.

3096
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:45,660
What does peace even look like?

3097
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:48,420
More customers always show up whenever...

3098
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:48,780
Alright.

3099
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:49,640
Let's see.

3100
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:50,420
I need to...

3101
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:50,640
Oh, yeah.

3102
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:51,020
I should...

3103
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:52,380
I need to still do the pie...

3104
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:54,260
Pie down thing too.

3105
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:55,340
Oh, my God.

3106
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:55,700
Okay.

3107
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:56,340
Uh...

3108
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:57,480
Let's just like...

3109
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:59,160
Grab a different...

3110
02:11:59,160 --> 02:11:59,960
Thing too.

3111
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:02,100
Peace bringer.

3112
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:02,600
Oh, my God.

3113
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:03,420
Do I bring...

3114
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:05,060
I shall force...

3115
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:08,280
This is called peace bringer?

3116
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:09,980
Holy fuck.

3117
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:10,720
Okay.

3118
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:14,920
I shall bring peace with violence.

3119
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:15,120
I shall bring peace with violence.

3120
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:17,420
Jesus.

3121
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,460
Why is that?

3122
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:19,500
Okay.

3123
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:20,560
Whatever.

3124
02:12:22,660 --> 02:12:25,940
The fact that this is peace bringer.

3125
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:29,220
Alright.

3126
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:29,840
Let's see.

3127
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,060
I'm not gonna use the ice.

3128
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:33,020
Eh...

3129
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:33,680
Uh...

3130
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,020
Fuck it.

3131
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:34,600
We'll do it.

3132
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:36,260
For peace.

3133
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:39,260
Permanent peace.

3134
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:41,040
Ha ha ha ha.

3135
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:42,420
Alright.

3136
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:43,720
What are my objectives again?

3137
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:45,620
Uh...

3138
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:46,020
Uh...

3139
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:47,480
I almost have seven.

3140
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,640
Defeat.

3141
02:12:49,060 --> 02:12:49,380
Uh...

3142
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:50,560
Uh...

3143
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,960
Root from a wheel recovery.

3144
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:53,640
Defeat foes with charge.

3145
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:54,280
Strong attack.

3146
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:54,660
Okay.

3147
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:55,220
I need that.

3148
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,600
And then...

3149
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:57,500
I need...

3150
02:12:57,500 --> 02:12:59,100
This stupid staff thing.

3151
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:00,660
Wait.

3152
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:01,520
I have another one?

3153
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:02,680
What was the other one?

3154
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:06,600
Charge.

3155
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:09,980
Continuous attacks.

3156
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:10,400
Oh.

3157
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:17,080
I guess people will be peaceful if they can summon someone...

3158
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:20,540
If they can summon volcano attack.

3159
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:22,260
For peace!

3160
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:27,940
Do I have like any like optional fights here?

3161
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:30,720
Oh, I do.

3162
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:32,880
Jesus.

3163
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:34,120
I need to be 42?

3164
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:35,420
For that?

3165
02:13:35,740 --> 02:13:36,500
How about this one?

3166
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:39,380
Okay.

3167
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:40,840
Oh, that's a baby one.

3168
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:41,080
Yeah.

3169
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:42,140
I'll take care of that.

3170
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,460
I'll take care of the baby fight.

3171
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:48,320
Wait.

3172
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:49,300
This is a baby one.

3173
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:50,380
I should do the...

3174
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:51,200
My weaker...

3175
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:51,900
Yeah.

3176
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,240
I should do the weaker one.

3177
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:54,000
Um.

3178
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:54,880
Which one was it?

3179
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:56,720
Lance.

3180
02:13:56,860 --> 02:13:56,920
Yeah.

3181
02:13:57,020 --> 02:13:58,080
I don't have a strong lance.

3182
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:00,620
Uh...

3183
02:14:00,620 --> 02:14:01,120
Oh.

3184
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,740
Wait on my high ground!

3185
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,060
Oh my god!

3186
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:08,300
It's...

3187
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:08,580
Oh wait.

3188
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:09,880
I do have a strong lance now.

3189
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:10,280
Oh.

3190
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:10,820
Okay.

3191
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:14,260
Uh...

3192
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:16,200
Oh my god!

3193
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:16,900
It's time!

3194
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:19,880
Guys!

3195
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:21,300
Guys!

3196
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:22,740
Why can't you...

3197
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:22,840
Guys!

3198
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:25,480
Guys!

3199
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:26,120
Come on!

3200
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:26,940
Guys!

3201
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,060
Can't get too far ahead.

3202
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,320
Stop here and see how things shake out.

3203
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,460
Oh my arrows are...

3204
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:32,520
God damn it!

3205
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:34,800
I can never rely on you guys.

3206
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,040
I am...

3207
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:41,080
I'm so sad.

3208
02:14:45,650 --> 02:14:47,470
I'm so sad, guys.

3209
02:14:50,810 --> 02:14:51,890
Did I do it?

3210
02:14:52,070 --> 02:14:53,730
I don't know if I did it correctly.

3211
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:56,950
Oh nice!

3212
02:15:03,070 --> 02:15:04,190
Did I have to hit me?

3213
02:15:06,670 --> 02:15:07,350
Hit me.

3214
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:08,410
Guys!

3215
02:15:08,630 --> 02:15:08,930
Come on!

3216
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:10,970
I need to do this stupid mission!

3217
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,370
Just hit me!

3218
02:15:22,190 --> 02:15:23,150
Hit me!

3219
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:30,110
Oh, I have to get hit.

3220
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:30,530
Okay.

3221
02:15:32,890 --> 02:15:33,970
Hit me, guys!

3222
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:39,010
I need to do this stupid mission!

3223
02:15:42,670 --> 02:15:43,230
Nice.

3224
02:15:45,110 --> 02:15:48,030
Oh my god, there's still yellow turban still around?

3225
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:49,910
The fuck are you guys still doing here?

3226
02:15:53,010 --> 02:15:53,930
Okay, nice.

3227
02:15:54,810 --> 02:15:57,070
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3228
02:15:57,830 --> 02:15:59,950
I'm just gonna do this so I can...

3229
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:02,670
An expeditious advance is essential to our cause.

3230
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:05,930
Everybody's dead, but I needed to do that.

3231
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:07,710
Wait, what is my mission?

3232
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:09,150
Defeat the veteran?

3233
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:09,990
Okay, nice.

3234
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:15,310
Alright, let's go.

3235
02:16:17,050 --> 02:16:17,810
Wait, what?

3236
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:18,310
Check in the advance.

3237
02:16:19,130 --> 02:16:19,910
Onward, everyone!

3238
02:16:20,470 --> 02:16:22,370
Oh, I have to defend the gates!

3239
02:16:22,370 --> 02:16:24,830
Oh my god, I was not reading it correctly.

3240
02:16:25,390 --> 02:16:25,650
Whoops.

3241
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:30,890
I got you!

3242
02:16:31,450 --> 02:16:32,450
An opening!

3243
02:16:33,090 --> 02:16:33,690
It's alright!

3244
02:16:33,950 --> 02:16:34,450
Hit me!

3245
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:38,850
Nice!

3246
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:43,190
Hello turban's never surrender!

3247
02:16:45,170 --> 02:16:46,110
Alright, nice!

3248
02:16:46,350 --> 02:16:46,930
Come on, hit me again!

3249
02:16:48,270 --> 02:16:48,610
Come on!

3250
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:49,310
Keep hitting me!

3251
02:16:49,590 --> 02:16:49,990
Nice!

3252
02:16:49,990 --> 02:16:51,990
Come on!

3253
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:53,290
Alright!

3254
02:16:53,790 --> 02:16:54,590
Get outta here!

3255
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:58,010
The enemy officer has been defeated!

3256
02:16:58,130 --> 02:16:59,890
Okay, now I can actually just...

3257
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:00,830
Kill you guys.

3258
02:17:06,610 --> 02:17:07,730
Wait, Jonfei?!

3259
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:11,410
This is it!

3260
02:17:11,570 --> 02:17:12,050
Okay!

3261
02:17:12,430 --> 02:17:13,210
Get out!

3262
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:16,530
This is how it's time to.

3263
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:18,030
Okay, I'ma...

3264
02:17:20,850 --> 02:17:21,570
That's fine.

3265
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:22,830
Oh wait, that's not fine!

3266
02:17:24,990 --> 02:17:25,750
That's fine!

3267
02:17:28,570 --> 02:17:29,090
Alright.

3268
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:35,210
Okay, how much more do I have to do this dumb... Okay, almost done.

3269
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:37,390
That's right!

3270
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:39,350
You will be the final hit!

3271
02:17:39,570 --> 02:17:40,530
Fucking finally!

3272
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:45,130
Okay, I got the lance done, and then the staff time.

3273
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:49,410
Alright, thank God these guys are bad, so I can do this.

3274
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:52,150
Alright.

3275
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:56,490
Oh wait, I can do this too!

3276
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:03,010
Oh.

3277
02:18:04,730 --> 02:18:06,350
Wait, am I doing... Oh wait, I did this!

3278
02:18:06,410 --> 02:18:07,550
I did this mission before!

3279
02:18:10,550 --> 02:18:11,010
Don't worry.

3280
02:18:12,330 --> 02:18:13,070
God damn it!

3281
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:14,330
Okay, never mind, worry.

3282
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:17,990
Oh, I was not paying attention to my HP!

3283
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:18,370
Whoops!

3284
02:18:21,610 --> 02:18:22,130
Oops!

3285
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:27,070
I was not paying attention to my HP there!

3286
02:18:27,290 --> 02:18:27,970
My bad!

3287
02:18:29,670 --> 02:18:32,270
I was like, why is my heart beating so fast?

3288
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:32,910
That's weird!

3289
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:36,010
That's awkward!

3290
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:39,110
That's awkward!

3291
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:40,910
Alright, nice.

3292
02:18:41,170 --> 02:18:42,950
Alright, we're going to the other side now.

3293
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:45,090
Jonfei, I believe in you!

3294
02:18:45,330 --> 02:18:45,790
Let's go!

3295
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:49,270
Jonfei, don't worry, you got this!

3296
02:18:51,510 --> 02:18:52,970
Now I'm on the other side!

3297
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:54,870
Come on!

3298
02:18:56,770 --> 02:18:57,990
Alright, Lupe is no way.

3299
02:18:58,130 --> 02:18:58,770
Lupe is fine.

3300
02:18:58,950 --> 02:18:59,590
See, I knew it.

3301
02:19:00,310 --> 02:19:02,110
I told you guys, Lupe will be fine.

3302
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:03,710
Wait, what?

3303
02:19:03,710 --> 02:19:04,550
What did I do?

3304
02:19:06,970 --> 02:19:07,990
How did it worsen?

3305
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:09,950
Let's give it to them!

3306
02:19:11,030 --> 02:19:11,670
Speed!

3307
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:14,410
Oh, shit!

3308
02:19:16,210 --> 02:19:17,790
Things don't look too good.

3309
02:19:18,050 --> 02:19:18,370
Oh, fuck!

3310
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:22,770
Okay, that's it!

3311
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:23,590
I'm angry!

3312
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:24,710
Your head is thorny!

3313
02:19:24,930 --> 02:19:25,990
I'm angry!

3314
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:26,890
You should touch you!

3315
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,270
You should touch you!

3316
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:28,950
That's it!

3317
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:33,530
That's- this one guy, I'm gonna kill you!

3318
02:19:33,610 --> 02:19:34,070
You can't see it all.

3319
02:19:34,130 --> 02:19:34,970
I'll take this.

3320
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:37,190
I can't believe this.

3321
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:37,250
I can't believe this.

3322
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:39,830
The enemy officer has- Thank you for coming.

3323
02:19:40,470 --> 02:19:41,250
Get over here!

3324
02:19:41,530 --> 02:19:42,770
Since the bond between is strengthened.

3325
02:19:44,770 --> 02:19:45,990
That's fucking right!

3326
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:48,630
Now I'm extra mad!

3327
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:51,990
I'm counting on you, now and beyond.

3328
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:52,990
Okay.

3329
02:19:54,570 --> 02:19:55,130
Concentrate!

3330
02:19:55,990 --> 02:19:57,470
Alright, got rid of him.

3331
02:19:57,610 --> 02:19:58,570
How about this?

3332
02:19:58,730 --> 02:19:59,530
Oh, shit!

3333
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:01,850
You can't avoid your fate!

3334
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:05,870
That's fucking right!

3335
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:07,850
Oh, you're so dead!

3336
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:09,770
Boop!

3337
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:14,090
Boop!

3338
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:15,550
Wait, you're supposed to be dead!

3339
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:17,170
What the fuck?!

3340
02:20:18,210 --> 02:20:19,390
That's fucking right!

3341
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:21,710
The enemy officer has been defeated!

3342
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:23,810
You don't get to avoid your fate!

3343
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:25,030
Let's get serious!

3344
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:26,330
Don't make me spin!

3345
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:29,430
Don't make me spin!

3346
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:29,930
Don't make me spin!

3347
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:30,210
Oh, shit!

3348
02:20:34,410 --> 02:20:35,250
That's right!

3349
02:20:35,590 --> 02:20:37,450
Now is the time for forward momentum.

3350
02:20:38,070 --> 02:20:38,090
Come!

3351
02:20:38,650 --> 02:20:39,110
Onward!

3352
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:40,810
March forward!

3353
02:20:41,590 --> 02:20:42,010
More?

3354
02:20:43,850 --> 02:20:45,490
Okay, did I do it correctly?

3355
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:46,910
The spinny thingy?

3356
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:49,490
Okay, I did!

3357
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:50,470
Okay, I did!

3358
02:20:50,470 --> 02:20:50,930
Okay, I couldn't tell!

3359
02:20:51,150 --> 02:20:51,730
I...

3360
02:20:51,730 --> 02:20:52,370
This...

3361
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:55,370
This is such a weird fucking special move!

3362
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:57,150
Our enemies fell to my incredible might!

3363
02:20:57,150 --> 02:20:57,870
That's fine!

3364
02:20:58,290 --> 02:20:59,910
The catapults can stay there!

3365
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:03,510
It's fine!

3366
02:21:09,490 --> 02:21:10,290
Oh, shit!

3367
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:14,150
I gotta let them have one thing, you know?

3368
02:21:18,050 --> 02:21:18,890
It's fine!

3369
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:21,030
The officer has been defeated!

3370
02:21:21,370 --> 02:21:22,110
You sure know how to fight!

3371
02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:24,510
Everything will be fine!

3372
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:26,250
I believe!

3373
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:28,110
Our allies are doing well!

3374
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:29,530
Or even is the catapults!

3375
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:31,070
Guys, how do they get up there?!

3376
02:21:31,070 --> 02:21:31,590
It's so...

3377
02:21:31,590 --> 02:21:32,490
It's so far!

3378
02:21:34,310 --> 02:21:34,750
Why?!

3379
02:21:35,310 --> 02:21:35,750
Wait!

3380
02:21:36,130 --> 02:21:36,510
Oh, shit!

3381
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:38,210
Guys, I think I should've...

3382
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:38,830
Oh, wait!

3383
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:39,490
Guys!

3384
02:21:42,350 --> 02:21:42,790
Wait!

3385
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:43,610
Wait a minute!

3386
02:21:44,070 --> 02:21:44,510
Wait!

3387
02:21:45,070 --> 02:21:46,390
What do you mean the castle?

3388
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:46,970
Guys!

3389
02:21:47,330 --> 02:21:47,890
Oh, fuck!

3390
02:21:48,150 --> 02:21:48,310
Wait!

3391
02:21:48,550 --> 02:21:49,630
Are you trying to tell me?

3392
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:50,790
Oh, wait!

3393
02:21:51,010 --> 02:21:51,450
Am I...

3394
02:21:54,090 --> 02:21:54,530
Wait!

3395
02:21:55,290 --> 02:21:58,170
What do you mean I was supposed to defend?

3396
02:21:58,550 --> 02:21:59,350
Oh, shit!

3397
02:21:59,790 --> 02:22:00,250
It's okay!

3398
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:00,770
It's okay!

3399
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:01,730
Everything will be fine!

3400
02:22:03,430 --> 02:22:04,390
I finished...

3401
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:05,830
It's okay!

3402
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:06,370
It's okay!

3403
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:06,890
It's okay!

3404
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:07,430
It's okay!

3405
02:22:07,690 --> 02:22:08,070
It's okay!

3406
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:11,870
Guys, I finished my thing though!

3407
02:22:12,050 --> 02:22:12,990
I finished my...

3408
02:22:12,990 --> 02:22:13,770
My weapon!

3409
02:22:15,550 --> 02:22:16,610
Alright, and then...

3410
02:22:17,050 --> 02:22:17,390
Oh, wait!

3411
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:18,070
The enemy...

3412
02:22:18,070 --> 02:22:19,130
Okay, now I can change it!

3413
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:21,370
It's okay!

3414
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:22,010
I finished...

3415
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:22,210
Guys!

3416
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:22,710
But!

3417
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:25,650
But!

3418
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:27,030
I finished it though!

3419
02:22:31,390 --> 02:22:32,110
It's okay!

3420
02:22:32,230 --> 02:22:32,790
It's peace!

3421
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:34,110
I'm here to bring!

3422
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:34,910
Peace!

3423
02:22:35,470 --> 02:22:35,890
Peace!

3424
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:38,490
It's okay guys!

3425
02:22:38,490 --> 02:22:39,470
I brought peace though!

3426
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:44,690
Things will be fine!

3427
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:45,590
Things will be fine!

3428
02:22:45,910 --> 02:22:46,010
Things will be fine!

3429
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:48,490
I just need to kill...

3430
02:22:49,390 --> 02:22:49,790
I just need to kill...

3431
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:50,170
There we go!

3432
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:50,630
Okay!

3433
02:22:51,150 --> 02:22:52,070
You killed one of them!

3434
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:54,490
The enemy officer has been defeated!

3435
02:22:54,930 --> 02:22:55,710
How about this?

3436
02:22:55,730 --> 02:22:56,590
We gotta get rid of him!

3437
02:22:59,410 --> 02:23:00,450
Just believe guys!

3438
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:01,450
Just keep on believing!

3439
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:02,390
Things will be okay!

3440
02:23:03,710 --> 02:23:04,170
Time to act!

3441
02:23:05,770 --> 02:23:07,090
I just need to kill him!

3442
02:23:10,050 --> 02:23:11,250
I just need to kill him!

3443
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:11,910
Oh my god!

3444
02:23:12,650 --> 02:23:15,970
Oh my god!

3445
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:16,510
Come on!

3446
02:23:17,510 --> 02:23:18,110
Please!

3447
02:23:23,070 --> 02:23:24,150
Jesus Christ!

3448
02:23:24,350 --> 02:23:25,890
He's so fucking tanky!

3449
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:27,630
Everybody else was a tanky!

3450
02:23:27,730 --> 02:23:29,030
Why are you so tanky?!

3451
02:23:34,170 --> 02:23:35,170
Let's get serious!

3452
02:23:35,470 --> 02:23:38,150
Everyone else was so fucking weak!

3453
02:23:42,110 --> 02:23:42,670
Jesus!

3454
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:44,030
It's just me and you!

3455
02:23:48,850 --> 02:23:49,610
That's it!

3456
02:23:50,930 --> 02:23:51,610
Get out!

3457
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:54,290
How did my perfect plan fail?

3458
02:23:54,470 --> 02:23:56,170
What do you mean, perfect plan?

3459
02:23:56,390 --> 02:23:57,430
What did you do?

3460
02:23:58,090 --> 02:23:59,090
Alright, wait, I'll get here.

3461
02:23:59,350 --> 02:23:59,750
Let's go!

3462
02:24:01,210 --> 02:24:01,770
Alright!

3463
02:24:02,770 --> 02:24:04,010
One more!

3464
02:24:04,130 --> 02:24:04,690
One more!

3465
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:07,170
One more!

3466
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:09,690
One more!

3467
02:24:10,450 --> 02:24:11,070
Don't worry!

3468
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:11,670
Jump in!

3469
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:14,130
I shall finish the job!

3470
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:22,620
Alright!

3471
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:24,960
Jesus!

3472
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:27,280
Come on!

3473
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:30,920
Jesus!

3474
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,720
I hate the tanky ones!

3475
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:34,880
The fucking, uh...

3476
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:37,060
The fucking neat sponges, right here.

3477
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:39,620
Time to die.

3478
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:42,400
Here, get out of that little bubble.

3479
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:44,580
You think a bubble is gonna save you?

3480
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:49,040
All right, last guy.

3481
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:51,140
Last man!

3482
02:24:55,180 --> 02:24:57,280
Tell them a sad story.

3483
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:04,180
Don't worry, let me... get rid of these guys first.

3484
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:09,320
I will not...

3485
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:09,780
What?

3486
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:10,980
Are you gonna challenge me?

3487
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:14,780
Wait, I got an idea.

3488
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:18,320
I can use the Dra... it's just one guy anyway.

3489
02:25:19,140 --> 02:25:20,260
Wait, no, that's not it.

3490
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:21,800
Where's Dragoon Destiny EX?

3491
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,600
For extra strong.

3492
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:25,540
Wait, there's two.

3493
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:27,860
Wait.

3494
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:30,260
Which one is stronger?

3495
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:31,060
Oh wait, that one.

3496
02:25:31,460 --> 02:25:31,580
Wait.

3497
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:33,200
Wait, that's the...

3498
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:34,680
Where's my two... Oh, there it is.

3499
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:36,800
It sounds like, where's the 264?

3500
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:40,680
Extra, extra, extra strong.

3501
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:44,940
That's fucking right.

3502
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:47,780
I paid good money for this.

3503
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:49,900
Get out of here.

3504
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:57,140
Oh my god, 2008.

3505
02:25:58,460 --> 02:25:59,540
What the fuck?

3506
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:00,460
That's right.

3507
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:01,760
Dragoon, go in!

3508
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:04,420
This is your job!

3509
02:26:06,060 --> 02:26:07,120
Oh my god.

3510
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,760
I'm glad you did one damage.

3511
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:10,800
Where is he?

3512
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:14,320
You know what?

3513
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:14,920
You know what?

3514
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:16,140
I believe you guys.

3515
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:16,940
Okay.

3516
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:18,940
Okay, guys.

3517
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,340
All right, just run away.

3518
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:26,380
Just...

3519
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,480
Just run away, I guess.

3520
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:29,180
Goodbye.

3521
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:33,780
Who's the enemy, boss?

3522
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:35,060
Where is he?

3523
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:35,420
Where is the officer?

3524
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:35,780
Where is the officer?

3525
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:36,760
I don't know.

3526
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:38,600
I wonder where he was.

3527
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:39,520
I...

3528
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:45,000
I wonder where the enemy was.

3529
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:50,200
I guess we'll never know.

3530
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:55,460
We got him, boys.

3531
02:27:00,190 --> 02:27:00,630
Nice.

3532
02:27:03,610 --> 02:27:04,490
Just need...

3533
02:27:04,490 --> 02:27:05,850
Okay, do we have enough for this?

3534
02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:07,390
Oh, we do.

3535
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:12,920
Fill up and can now...

3536
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:15,520
You have now acquired skill and can now activate to do so.

3537
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:17,380
Complete fill up the extended and...

3538
02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:17,900
Oh, okay.

3539
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:18,300
Nice.

3540
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:19,340
Why don't you can unleash...

3541
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:22,640
Or you can unleash the...

3542
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:24,980
When your musu go or you press...

3543
02:27:24,980 --> 02:27:28,760
It's also activated without full as long as the gauge has reached the...

3544
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:29,260
Oh, nice.

3545
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:30,540
Okay, we did it.

3546
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:35,980
I learned how to get angry.

3547
02:27:40,310 --> 02:27:42,430
Oh, and I got two more guards to run away.

3548
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:49,780
Oh, I got a cavalry charge?

3549
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:57,180
Is this right?

3550
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:57,760
Yeah.

3551
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,200
Okay, there's no way you can fuck this one up.

3552
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:10,360
What's this?

3553
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:13,040
Oh, I like this.

3554
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:14,040
Surround me.

3555
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:18,600
Oh, my God.

3556
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:20,940
Yeah, you guys are not fucking doing anything with that.

3557
02:28:24,340 --> 02:28:26,980
There's no way you can fuck up the horse.

3558
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:28,280
I should save.

3559
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:29,460
Let me save real fast.

3560
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:34,620
There's no way you could fuck that one up.

3561
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:36,560
I refuse to believe.

3562
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:39,560
Are you sure about that?

3563
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,280
Okay, I should be nice.

3564
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:45,760
All right.

3565
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:48,680
I should be able to level up my remaining ones that I need to do.

3566
02:28:59,010 --> 02:28:59,810
There's no way.

3567
02:28:59,950 --> 02:29:01,430
I refuse to believe you can fuck up.

3568
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:02,310
Oh, my God.

3569
02:29:02,490 --> 02:29:04,070
No, I can't.

3570
02:29:04,250 --> 02:29:07,490
Oh, but I'm on high ground.

3571
02:29:11,210 --> 02:29:12,070
I'm sad.

3572
02:29:15,570 --> 02:29:17,210
Okay, let's grab.

3573
02:29:18,330 --> 02:29:19,890
Okay, we need to do this for...

3574
02:29:19,890 --> 02:29:22,170
Let's mortify our defenses, comrades.

3575
02:29:25,230 --> 02:29:27,270
Boom, that's fucking right.

3576
02:29:27,530 --> 02:29:30,790
Come on.

3577
02:29:31,090 --> 02:29:31,570
That's enough.

3578
02:29:31,810 --> 02:29:32,890
Guys, let me go.

3579
02:29:33,810 --> 02:29:35,650
I need to use my...

3580
02:29:37,350 --> 02:29:38,610
I need peace.

3581
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:40,770
Oh, my God.

3582
02:29:41,550 --> 02:29:43,670
I'm trying to use my special.

3583
02:29:44,770 --> 02:29:46,370
Oh, my God.

3584
02:29:47,830 --> 02:29:48,430
Fuckers.

3585
02:29:51,070 --> 02:29:52,430
Oh, my God.

3586
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:53,130
I'm trying to...

3587
02:29:53,130 --> 02:29:53,650
Oh, my God.

3588
02:29:53,770 --> 02:29:54,050
I'm mad.

3589
02:29:55,050 --> 02:29:55,890
I'm mad.

3590
02:29:59,110 --> 02:30:01,090
I'm trying to use this move.

3591
02:30:01,890 --> 02:30:03,390
That's literally the old...

3592
02:30:03,390 --> 02:30:04,650
I can't use it.

3593
02:30:07,310 --> 02:30:08,650
There's so many people.

3594
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:16,890
There's actually just too many people that I can't charge.

3595
02:30:17,070 --> 02:30:18,890
I literally can't charge my attack.

3596
02:30:19,690 --> 02:30:21,730
I can't charge my attack.

3597
02:30:24,550 --> 02:30:25,530
Oh, my God.

3598
02:30:25,530 --> 02:30:26,650
I finally completed it.

3599
02:30:26,830 --> 02:30:27,810
Oh, my God.

3600
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:29,870
That was such a struggle.

3601
02:30:30,690 --> 02:30:31,010
I...

3602
02:30:36,590 --> 02:30:37,230
Okay.

3603
02:30:41,630 --> 02:30:42,310
All right.

3604
02:30:42,410 --> 02:30:42,550
All right.

3605
02:30:42,550 --> 02:30:42,930
That's it.

3606
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:44,190
That's it.

3607
02:30:44,310 --> 02:30:44,990
I'm getting...

3608
02:30:44,990 --> 02:30:45,990
I'm getting it out.

3609
02:30:46,270 --> 02:30:46,470
I'm...

3610
02:30:46,470 --> 02:30:46,970
I'm out.

3611
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:48,770
I finished it.

3612
02:30:49,470 --> 02:30:50,090
That's it.

3613
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:51,910
Dragoon Destiny.

3614
02:30:51,930 --> 02:30:52,970
Get in here.

3615
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:55,290
It's over.

3616
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:57,050
It's over.

3617
02:30:57,050 --> 02:30:57,490
I'm done.

3618
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:04,500
All right.

3619
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:09,680
It's fucking over for you.

3620
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:14,260
I'm done to play around.

3621
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:18,100
Oh, my God.

3622
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:18,360
Oh, my God.

3623
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:18,880
Please.

3624
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:21,860
I can't.

3625
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,580
Where are the rest of the horses?

3626
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,840
Get all these horses out of here.

3627
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:36,080
Jesus Christ.

3628
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:41,840
I'm fucking...

3629
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:42,580
I'm losing it here.

3630
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:44,300
I'm gonna lose it.

3631
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:46,440
I'm gonna lose it.

3632
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:53,280
My God.

3633
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:54,420
I already killed a thousand.

3634
02:31:56,120 --> 02:31:58,580
You are a true warrior of the three kingdoms.

3635
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:00,480
Where are all the horses?

3636
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:05,200
I can't tell where they are.

3637
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:06,180
I'm getting angry.

3638
02:32:06,460 --> 02:32:07,680
I'm getting mad.

3639
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:12,560
I don't know where all the horses are.

3640
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:13,920
I'm mad now.

3641
02:32:18,060 --> 02:32:19,360
I'm just gonna use ice.

3642
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:23,660
That's right.

3643
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:31,740
I didn't know where all the horses were.

3644
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:33,380
I got mad.

3645
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:35,500
Where did it all go?

3646
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:39,280
You must be good.

3647
02:32:39,820 --> 02:32:40,760
Let us fight.

3648
02:32:41,420 --> 02:32:43,880
The old brand one is the key to turning the tide.

3649
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:45,620
You get in pursuit.

3650
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:46,420
Immediately.

3651
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:49,260
All my might.

3652
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:52,980
Jesus, there's so many.

3653
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:55,060
Inner fire.

3654
02:32:55,660 --> 02:32:56,840
Where do I have to go?

3655
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:57,660
Where am I?

3656
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:01,860
Jesus Christ.

3657
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:04,680
All right, do something.

3658
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:07,100
There's six of you.

3659
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:08,260
There's still enough time.

3660
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:13,500
Oh my god.

3661
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:14,700
Nice.

3662
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,400
I don't know what's going on anymore.

3663
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:17,480
Things are...

3664
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:18,880
I'm at 2,000.

3665
02:33:21,340 --> 02:33:23,440
How did I get to 2k?

3666
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:25,840
I literally got to 500.

3667
02:33:29,970 --> 02:33:30,610
Nice.

3668
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:33,390
Jesus Christ.

3669
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:33,490
Guys.

3670
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:35,850
Look at all these widows.

3671
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:40,090
Holy fuck.

3672
02:33:41,870 --> 02:33:44,350
Look at all the widows I made, guys.

3673
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:47,730
Okay.

3674
02:33:49,730 --> 02:33:51,410
I'm almost close to the ice.

3675
02:33:51,890 --> 02:33:52,690
Ice time!

3676
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:57,870
Holy fuck.

3677
02:33:57,870 --> 02:33:58,450
Okay, yeah.

3678
02:33:58,550 --> 02:33:59,550
That move is strong.

3679
02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:01,090
You guys were right.

3680
02:34:01,390 --> 02:34:03,130
That move is actually strong as fuck.

3681
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:08,870
Like, I don't even know how I accidentally traveled to the bandit leader.

3682
02:34:09,550 --> 02:34:12,510
Like, there's so many things going on on my screen.

3683
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:15,130
I don't even know how.

3684
02:34:21,090 --> 02:34:23,230
Like, things just keep happening.

3685
02:34:23,490 --> 02:34:24,610
Oh, fuck.

3686
02:34:27,610 --> 02:34:30,130
Like, I just killed four different people.

3687
02:34:30,510 --> 02:34:30,870
I...

3688
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:32,570
The enemy officer.

3689
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:36,610
I just killed four different people at once.

3690
02:34:36,930 --> 02:34:37,750
That's crazy.

3691
02:34:39,810 --> 02:34:40,850
Alright, nice.

3692
02:34:42,930 --> 02:34:43,530
Alright.

3693
02:34:44,030 --> 02:34:45,550
It should be the last guy.

3694
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:48,750
Goodbye!

3695
02:34:50,850 --> 02:34:52,270
We end this now!

3696
02:34:53,690 --> 02:34:56,450
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3697
02:34:56,650 --> 02:34:56,670
Yay!

3698
02:34:57,830 --> 02:34:58,550
Holy shit.

3699
02:34:58,670 --> 02:35:00,850
Okay, the ice move is actually so fucking strong.

3700
02:35:01,190 --> 02:35:02,970
This territory is ours.

3701
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:03,430
Looking rough.

3702
02:35:04,390 --> 02:35:04,510
Whoa.

3703
02:35:05,570 --> 02:35:06,030
That...

3704
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:09,090
That ice move, like, gave me a thousand deaths.

3705
02:35:09,090 --> 02:35:10,230
Like, passively.

3706
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:12,430
There were just bodies around me at that point.

3707
02:35:13,450 --> 02:35:15,530
I'm just like, what happened?

3708
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:27,400
Yeah, that move was actually insane.

3709
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:31,180
Alright, I completed his stuff.

3710
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:33,960
Uh...

3711
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:34,960
Alright, we need more attack.

3712
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:43,640
Another knot in the belt.

3713
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:45,920
It's gamer time.

3714
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:49,180
Nice, I got two guards to run away even more.

3715
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:51,060
That's cruel.

3716
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:52,000
That's cool.

3717
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:54,160
Two more guards to run away from.

3718
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:57,380
Alright, this way.

3719
02:35:57,580 --> 02:35:58,060
Gah!

3720
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:01,640
Lord Zulu one has a discerning...

3721
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:03,300
Wait, I should have enough for...

3722
02:36:04,220 --> 02:36:04,700
Story...

3723
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:06,080
Uh...

3724
02:36:07,240 --> 02:36:09,920
Yeah, I should have enough for my second tier.

3725
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:11,080
For my romance.

3726
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:12,540
Lord Zulu one has a discerning...

3727
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:14,520
Okay, it should be like...

3728
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:15,740
Okay, I don't know where he is, though.

3729
02:36:15,740 --> 02:36:16,600
I need to look...

3730
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:17,000
Go back.

3731
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:22,920
Thank you for the super chat.

3732
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:23,340
Thank you.

3733
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:24,040
Thank you.

3734
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:25,080
Oh, wait.

3735
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:25,820
He doesn't want to talk to me?

3736
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:26,240
I...

3737
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:27,380
Go show him what you're made of.

3738
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:29,280
I completed your objectives!

3739
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:31,480
Why don't you want to talk to me?

3740
02:36:32,020 --> 02:36:33,060
Wait, where did my objective...

3741
02:36:33,060 --> 02:36:33,660
Oh, there is his.

3742
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:34,360
Alright.

3743
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:37,580
Oh, I tend to his stupid battle art chain.

3744
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:38,620
That's the one thing I forgot.

3745
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:40,080
God, fucking...

3746
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:40,900
He gave me so many missions.

3747
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:42,100
I don't keep track of it.

3748
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:42,840
He gave...

3749
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:43,640
He gave...

3750
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:45,780
He gave me too many missions!

3751
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:51,200
With fully charged strong attacks using...

3752
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:52,140
Didn't I do that?

3753
02:36:52,400 --> 02:36:54,460
Does it have to be even more fully charged?

3754
02:36:59,280 --> 02:36:59,800
Eh.

3755
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:03,700
Oh, I guess...

3756
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:03,960
I...

3757
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:05,680
I guess I'll do chin poos.

3758
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:06,800
I need...

3759
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:08,260
From either...

3760
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:09,040
Either...

3761
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:11,200
With wide attacks from either gauntlet stance.

3762
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,100
Okay, how...

3763
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:13,340
Do I have the weapons for it?

3764
02:37:13,340 --> 02:37:13,900
I do.

3765
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:15,460
Alright, it's time.

3766
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:17,920
It's time to do the old man one.

3767
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:20,460
I have two stages charge?

3768
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:26,560
Okay, that shit was fucking rough.

3769
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:31,720
I should be a left level, yeah.

3770
02:37:33,940 --> 02:37:35,400
Also, El, thank you for the super chat.

3771
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:36,060
Thank you, thank you.

3772
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:38,920
It's been a pretty bad week for me, so thanks for streaming today, Doki.

3773
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:40,460
It really brings a smile to my face.

3774
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:41,280
Thank you for the super chat.

3775
02:37:41,380 --> 02:37:41,940
Thank you, thank you.

3776
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,420
I'm glad you've been enjoying the streams and cheering you up.

3777
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:50,860
Alright, we have left Lord Tau Tau's to follow the bay to a county council in you.

3778
02:37:51,400 --> 02:37:54,100
Someone is engaged in combat with Tau Tau's forces nearby.

3779
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:57,140
We cannot be certain that they are my brother's troops, but it's worth confirming.

3780
02:37:57,620 --> 02:38:01,480
Our primary concern at present is Lord Tau Tau's numerous checkpoints.

3781
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:07,240
Though he has given us permission to pass, given the current battle, I imagine we will see some resistance.

3782
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:09,600
We are forced to fight our way through...

3783
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,720
This is the most plot we've ever had for Dynasty Warriors stream.

3784
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:15,740
Like, we have... we did not have...

3785
02:38:15,740 --> 02:38:16,780
I'm so sad.

3786
02:38:16,980 --> 02:38:17,380
We...

3787
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:22,000
The lack of romancing is making me upset!

3788
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:27,040
As such, we will have Lube's family stay in the castle.

3789
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,000
Only we will venture forward.

3790
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:34,120
Even if I must travel a thousand lean, I will reach my sworn brother's side, as befits my vow.

3791
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:36,000
Let me your strength, Natoki.

3792
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:38,140
Let us show Lube our quality.

3793
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:39,080
All right, nice.

3794
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:41,360
My time has come.

3795
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:42,800
I need to be...

3796
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:43,320
Feed me!

3797
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:48,460
No matter the obstacle, let us return to Lube's side.

3798
02:38:49,060 --> 02:38:50,220
I will die!

3799
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:52,900
Feed me or I die!

3800
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,260
Yeah, I have to...

3801
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:01,160
Okay, there is...

3802
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:01,700
What...

3803
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:02,340
What's going on?

3804
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:03,060
Stop right there!

3805
02:39:03,220 --> 02:39:04,640
We're in the middle of a battle.

3806
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:06,860
I cannot let you pass without permission.

3807
02:39:08,220 --> 02:39:09,760
I am Guan Yu.

3808
02:39:10,120 --> 02:39:12,360
I have received Lord Tao Tao's house.

3809
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:14,080
Wait, how come you get the red horse?

3810
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:18,040
Wait, you died during this fight!

3811
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:20,460
Wait!

3812
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:22,320
That's not fair!

3813
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:23,980
That's fucked up!

3814
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:26,340
He gets to keep the red horse?

3815
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:29,360
I have to find my brother, even if it means forcing my way.

3816
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:30,520
Forgive me!

3817
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:32,540
That's fucked up.

3818
02:39:33,740 --> 02:39:35,140
That's actually fucked up.

3819
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:37,380
Is that it?

3820
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:40,400
I'm doing it?

3821
02:39:40,440 --> 02:39:40,980
Yeah, okay.

3822
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:43,820
Is that it?

3823
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:45,340
I'm just gonna keep doing that.

3824
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,060
Boom!

3825
02:39:46,740 --> 02:39:47,340
Ha ha ha ha!

3826
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:49,120
Nice!

3827
02:39:50,220 --> 02:39:50,660
Get out of here!

3828
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:54,260
I'm not worthy!

3829
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,320
Let's go!

3830
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:58,640
Open that door!

3831
02:39:59,080 --> 02:39:59,860
I'm sad!

3832
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:01,160
Open the door!

3833
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:03,720
I'm sad now!

3834
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:14,600
I spent two, almost two hours killing Lupu and I don't even get rewarded.

3835
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:17,240
I understand that it's your duty to stand in my way.

3836
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:22,380
But still, I must get through to find my brother!

3837
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:25,220
Get out of here!

3838
02:40:27,380 --> 02:40:27,900
Okay.

3839
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,640
That's fucking right!

3840
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:33,900
I hate to be right sometimes.

3841
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:35,680
Get out of here!

3842
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:37,820
I can't believe this.

3843
02:40:37,820 --> 02:40:39,920
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3844
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:43,160
There's the other guy.

3845
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:44,140
Time to act.

3846
02:40:44,860 --> 02:40:45,320
Is that it?

3847
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:46,320
That's right!

3848
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:47,040
That one guy!

3849
02:40:47,340 --> 02:40:48,040
Get fucked!

3850
02:40:48,260 --> 02:40:50,420
I wanted to avoid fighting them if I could.

3851
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:55,800
But I suppose we must brush off these embers so we don't catch fire later.

3852
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:58,020
Nice!

3853
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:01,220
I don't know what's going on, but nice!

3854
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:05,080
Jesus!

3855
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:06,460
What the fuck?

3856
02:41:11,240 --> 02:41:12,680
Okay, get out of here!

3857
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:17,220
All right, it's your turn!

3858
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:20,960
Oh, what the fuck?

3859
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:22,600
How did I get interrupted?

3860
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:26,580
That's right, get punched!

3861
02:41:30,370 --> 02:41:32,610
God, this battle art fucking sucks.

3862
02:41:33,350 --> 02:41:34,850
I hate this battle art.

3863
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:38,490
Oh my god!

3864
02:41:38,630 --> 02:41:40,790
Who let you attack so many times?!

3865
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:43,490
I'm just using my face!

3866
02:41:46,970 --> 02:41:47,770
That's right!

3867
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:48,070
Okay, nice!

3868
02:41:49,850 --> 02:41:51,990
All right, get punched!

3869
02:41:52,390 --> 02:41:53,270
Get punched!

3870
02:41:54,270 --> 02:41:56,630
You just dodged it?!

3871
02:41:57,470 --> 02:41:59,010
How do you just jump behind?

3872
02:41:59,470 --> 02:42:02,270
That's right, I'll never stop punching!

3873
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:04,730
It's so goofy!

3874
02:42:06,610 --> 02:42:09,710
All right, coming back!

3875
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:11,670
Oh my god, nice.

3876
02:42:12,670 --> 02:42:14,010
I gotta battle it.

3877
02:42:18,590 --> 02:42:19,450
Okay, nice.

3878
02:42:20,050 --> 02:42:20,970
He's gotta keep punching.

3879
02:42:22,850 --> 02:42:26,350
I can't believe he would just jump away from my fist like that.

3880
02:42:27,550 --> 02:42:28,730
That's fucked up, buddy.

3881
02:42:29,570 --> 02:42:30,530
That's all I have.

3882
02:42:32,970 --> 02:42:34,930
Oh my god, he just fights back.

3883
02:42:36,450 --> 02:42:36,970
Fine.

3884
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:39,310
I can fight back, too.

3885
02:42:39,710 --> 02:42:40,810
Get out of here!

3886
02:42:40,990 --> 02:42:44,110
I'm bringing a fist to a knife fight.

3887
02:42:44,330 --> 02:42:46,630
The enemy officer has been defeated.

3888
02:42:46,830 --> 02:42:47,450
Well, I still can.

3889
02:42:47,810 --> 02:42:49,570
Alright, how much more do I have?

3890
02:42:50,270 --> 02:42:52,270
How much more do I have?

3891
02:42:55,170 --> 02:42:55,690
Fifty!

3892
02:42:55,790 --> 02:42:56,050
Okay.

3893
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:57,930
Still fifty more.

3894
02:42:58,670 --> 02:43:02,110
Okay, I'm actually progressing a lot faster than I thought I would.

3895
02:43:02,610 --> 02:43:03,530
For fifty.

3896
02:43:03,810 --> 02:43:06,930
I thought I had... I didn't realize I killed that many people.

3897
02:43:07,170 --> 02:43:08,750
Looks like we have a long way to go still.

3898
02:43:10,250 --> 02:43:11,670
Let's pick up the pace a bit.

3899
02:43:12,150 --> 02:43:12,470
Sorry.

3900
02:43:12,570 --> 02:43:14,350
I'm just trying to... Sorry, Guan Yun.

3901
02:43:14,510 --> 02:43:15,910
Just XP things, okay?

3902
02:43:17,310 --> 02:43:20,830
Hey, how do I...

3903
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:23,570
Guan Yun, what do you... Wait, Guan Yun, where are you?

3904
02:43:23,730 --> 02:43:25,750
Wait, did he just... Oh, I could...

3905
02:43:27,610 --> 02:43:29,730
Oh, I could just ride around.

3906
02:43:30,290 --> 02:43:30,610
Oops.

3907
02:43:31,970 --> 02:43:33,530
I was like, where did he go?

3908
02:43:36,870 --> 02:43:38,450
I got confused, okay?

3909
02:43:38,670 --> 02:43:41,050
I was like, where did... Where did Guan Yun go?

3910
02:43:45,870 --> 02:43:46,970
Guan Yun, please!

3911
02:43:47,470 --> 02:43:48,750
Give me more XP!

3912
02:43:53,490 --> 02:43:55,230
Stop killing all of them!

3913
02:43:57,070 --> 02:43:59,270
I need the XP, Guan Yun!

3914
02:44:00,850 --> 02:44:01,610
Let's go!

3915
02:44:02,070 --> 02:44:03,430
You rotten deserters!

3916
02:44:03,850 --> 02:44:05,570
Your little journey ends here!

3917
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:06,650
What do you mean?

3918
02:44:06,830 --> 02:44:07,830
Tauchou promised!

3919
02:44:08,250 --> 02:44:09,490
You'll have to get by me first!

3920
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:11,350
He said I could go home!

3921
02:44:11,630 --> 02:44:11,690
Close the gates!

3922
02:44:12,390 --> 02:44:14,210
Prepare to engage these traitors!

3923
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:20,660
The third gate is getting closed?

3924
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:24,180
Oh my god, this stupid Brock!

3925
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:27,000
Wait, how did he...

3926
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,320
How did he do that?

3927
02:44:29,320 --> 02:44:30,540
Drive us off the cliffs.

3928
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:31,560
How did he...

3929
02:44:31,900 --> 02:44:33,460
We must proceed carefully here.

3930
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:35,000
How did he...

3931
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,800
How did he jump?

3932
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:38,240
I forgot how he...

3933
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:39,620
Oh!

3934
02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:41,740
Sorry!

3935
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:44,480
I don't remember how he jumped!

3936
02:44:45,380 --> 02:44:46,480
I was so confused!

3937
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:49,520
Okay, I was like, how did he do that?

3938
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:52,540
How did he do that?

3939
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:54,060
That's so fucking weird.

3940
02:44:56,300 --> 02:44:59,020
Look, I got confused, okay?

3941
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:05,280
Okay, I don't need that.

3942
02:45:07,240 --> 02:45:09,100
I got spirit, though.

3943
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:13,840
Okay, I might have been confused, but I got spirit.

3944
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:15,500
Oh my god, I did it.

3945
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:20,540
Okay, nice.

3946
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:21,240
It's done.

3947
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:22,420
It's actually done.

3948
02:45:23,620 --> 02:45:25,460
Alright, we did that.

3949
02:45:25,740 --> 02:45:29,140
Then we have... I mean, I guess we could do panic.

3950
02:45:29,460 --> 02:45:30,320
Oh my god.

3951
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:35,700
We need to fucking successfully get a tactic in before we do any of that bullshit.

3952
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:39,080
Alright, where's Dragoon's Destiny EX?

3953
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:41,560
Where is it?

3954
02:45:42,960 --> 02:45:43,800
Alright, there we go.

3955
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:44,120
Wait.

3956
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:46,440
Is that the prop one... the EX we want?

3957
02:45:47,580 --> 02:45:50,100
Okay, I'm so confused with all of these stats.

3958
02:45:50,340 --> 02:45:51,280
EX plus four.

3959
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:52,860
Oh wait, EX plus four.

3960
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:54,520
That's better because it's plus four.

3961
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:57,600
Take this.

3962
02:45:57,700 --> 02:45:58,580
That's right.

3963
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:00,180
I'm done fucking around.

3964
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:00,720
I see it.

3965
02:46:01,900 --> 02:46:03,520
I'm done fucking around.

3966
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:03,520
I see it.

3967
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:03,700
I'm done fucking around.

3968
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:06,740
There we go.

3969
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:06,820
There we go.

3970
02:46:07,160 --> 02:46:09,680
I have a better weapon now.

3971
02:46:11,460 --> 02:46:12,600
Big number.

3972
02:46:16,140 --> 02:46:17,460
Alright, get over here.

3973
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:21,720
Alright, nice.

3974
02:46:23,020 --> 02:46:25,680
We can't use Musou Attack yet, Guan Yin.

3975
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:26,920
I know you want to.

3976
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:28,840
But we gotta save it.

3977
02:46:29,660 --> 02:46:31,980
We gotta save it for Tao Tao.

3978
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:33,180
Whoops.

3979
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:35,500
Accidentally ate a bun.

3980
02:46:37,800 --> 02:46:38,620
Boom.

3981
02:46:39,860 --> 02:46:40,680
Boom.

3982
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:42,700
Boom.

3983
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:42,840
Boom.

3984
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:45,260
Alright, that's three big booms.

3985
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:46,800
Let's go.

3986
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:50,080
We go this way.

3987
02:46:52,420 --> 02:46:53,740
Horse Thief?

3988
02:46:56,320 --> 02:46:58,100
What are you doing here?

3989
02:46:58,900 --> 02:46:59,440
Tao Yun?

3990
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:02,060
Oh, this is awkward.

3991
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:04,920
Hey, um... I'm wearing your old armor.

3992
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:05,660
This is awkward.

3993
02:47:08,080 --> 02:47:08,600
Where?

3994
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:09,200
Where?

3995
02:47:10,940 --> 02:47:14,520
Has he been chasing that horse Thief this entire time?

3996
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:15,020
It's possible.

3997
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:15,880
I would very much like to speak with Lord Liu Bei.

3998
02:47:17,140 --> 02:47:18,000
Lord Tao Yun.

3999
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:19,400
How are you not caught him?

4000
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:21,060
He doesn't even have a horse.

4001
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:22,720
I, too, am searching for him.

4002
02:47:23,860 --> 02:47:26,800
I never... This seems more complicated than I had thought.

4003
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:28,840
Lord Guan Yu.

4004
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:31,040
I will join you in your search.

4005
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:33,860
Perhaps together, we can find Lord Liu Bei.

4006
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:35,200
Oh.

4007
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:37,540
You would be a great help indeed.

4008
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:38,780
Yes.

4009
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:40,700
Let us go together.

4010
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:42,880
Alright.

4011
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:44,840
That's awkward.

4012
02:47:45,320 --> 02:47:46,380
That's so awkward.

4013
02:47:46,580 --> 02:47:49,840
Hey, like, I normally wear your old clothes, but like, hey.

4014
02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:52,300
You know... Look.

4015
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:54,520
It's just, you know...

4016
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:56,260
I found it, okay?

4017
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,180
That's... That's really it, Talion.

4018
02:47:58,220 --> 02:47:59,540
I found these clothes.

4019
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:01,260
It's over there.

4020
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:03,320
You cannot allow them to return to Liu Bei's side.

4021
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:03,720
Oh, wait.

4022
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:05,000
Why is the horse thief there?

4023
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:06,200
I'll have to deal with you.

4024
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:06,700
Oh, what?

4025
02:48:07,180 --> 02:48:07,480
Wait.

4026
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:09,520
Guys, I found the horse thief.

4027
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:11,740
Alright, you can't fuck this up, dragoons.

4028
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:13,160
There's no way.

4029
02:48:13,280 --> 02:48:13,940
There we go.

4030
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:14,280
See?

4031
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:15,700
There we go.

4032
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:16,140
Oh, fuck.

4033
02:48:16,300 --> 02:48:16,520
No!

4034
02:48:18,020 --> 02:48:18,880
Oh, no.

4035
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:20,660
I wasted my Musou accidentally.

4036
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:24,560
I finally found him!

4037
02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:26,900
I'll figure out a way to join him.

4038
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:28,920
And then I'll never leave his side.

4039
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:29,820
Oh, my God.

4040
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:34,600
It's now secretly following Guan Yin.

4041
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:35,840
You're amazing!

4042
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:38,660
Oh, my God.

4043
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:40,520
He's secretly following us now.

4044
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:43,120
Alright.

4045
02:48:44,020 --> 02:48:47,660
When will I ever be on high ground to launch my arrows?

4046
02:48:48,300 --> 02:48:49,800
Will it ever happen?

4047
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:54,780
I feel like by the time...

4048
02:48:58,780 --> 02:49:01,340
I feel like by the time we get there...

4049
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:04,560
Okay, we gotta save our...

4050
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:05,740
I'm gonna save the ice attack.

4051
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:07,200
Until it matters.

4052
02:49:08,120 --> 02:49:09,380
I'm going for a quick run.

4053
02:49:09,620 --> 02:49:11,500
We'll see how useful I can be.

4054
02:49:13,480 --> 02:49:14,280
You know what?

4055
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:14,760
Fuck it.

4056
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:16,500
I'm...

4057
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:17,220
I got bored.

4058
02:49:17,860 --> 02:49:18,540
Wait, what?

4059
02:49:21,060 --> 02:49:21,540
Wait.

4060
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:23,260
Wait a minute.

4061
02:49:23,380 --> 02:49:24,200
That's all it did?

4062
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:31,400
Okay, maybe I should stop.

4063
02:49:34,420 --> 02:49:36,540
Wait, I can do it with Calvary Charge, too?

4064
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:38,960
Oh, wait, that's good.

4065
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:41,600
That's the last of them.

4066
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:42,940
We did it, my lord.

4067
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:45,300
No, we just gotta kill him.

4068
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:47,920
Oh, lord.

4069
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:48,540
Go.

4070
02:49:49,380 --> 02:49:51,060
Uh, no.

4071
02:49:51,560 --> 02:49:52,600
I just...

4072
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:53,700
It's an old habit.

4073
02:49:54,180 --> 02:49:54,920
Well, whatever.

4074
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:57,460
My name is Jonsan.

4075
02:49:57,720 --> 02:49:57,820
Alright.

4076
02:49:58,060 --> 02:49:59,020
Let's go.

4077
02:50:00,620 --> 02:50:02,000
Wait, I can do this.

4078
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:03,200
Just for XP.

4079
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:03,360
Please.

4080
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:03,580
Please.

4081
02:50:04,300 --> 02:50:05,680
Take me under your wind.

4082
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:07,780
We're going you.

4083
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:09,040
We aren't out of danger yet.

4084
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:10,360
Boom.

4085
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:11,020
We did it.

4086
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:13,580
You may come with us for now.

4087
02:50:13,820 --> 02:50:14,220
We did it.

4088
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:15,060
Open the door.

4089
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:16,020
Open the door.

4090
02:50:16,180 --> 02:50:16,740
He's right there.

4091
02:50:17,260 --> 02:50:17,600
Open it.

4092
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:21,920
I'll follow you to the farthest reaches of the kingdom for as long as I live.

4093
02:50:22,360 --> 02:50:23,300
Open the door.

4094
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:24,180
He's right here.

4095
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:26,580
I can't stop them.

4096
02:50:26,820 --> 02:50:27,980
He doesn't...

4097
02:50:27,980 --> 02:50:28,260
No!

4098
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:32,120
We almost got out.

4099
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:33,580
It's okay.

4100
02:50:36,980 --> 02:50:37,580
It's time.

4101
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:46,300
But if you must insist on standing in my way, then prepare to meet my blade.

4102
02:50:47,900 --> 02:50:48,840
That's fucking right.

4103
02:50:49,630 --> 02:50:50,300
This is it.

4104
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:52,420
This is it.

4105
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:53,660
That's right.

4106
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:57,200
You pissed off the wrong person.

4107
02:50:59,140 --> 02:51:02,060
I don't need to duel him if I just beat Guan Yun.

4108
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:05,900
Why duel him when I can beat Guan Yun, guys?

4109
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:14,920
Why waste my time with that?

4110
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:17,360
When I could just do this.

4111
02:51:18,100 --> 02:51:19,480
Get closer, please!

4112
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:21,080
Get closer, please!

4113
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:23,720
Get cl...

4114
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:25,360
Ooh...

4115
02:51:26,480 --> 02:51:27,520
Good point.

4116
02:51:31,540 --> 02:51:32,920
You did it!

4117
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:34,620
You did it!

4118
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:38,120
There's a second half?

4119
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:40,920
Wait, what do you mean?

4120
02:51:42,320 --> 02:51:43,300
Wait, no.

4121
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:44,940
The map ends here, guys.

4122
02:51:44,940 --> 02:51:47,480
It says, map end.

4123
02:51:47,660 --> 02:51:48,280
Hahaha.

4124
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:52,080
Where's the victory?

4125
02:51:52,760 --> 02:51:53,800
Victory?

4126
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:55,500
Victory?

4127
02:51:58,220 --> 02:51:59,260
Victory?

4128
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:02,240
Victory?

4129
02:52:03,900 --> 02:52:04,420
Wait!

4130
02:52:04,980 --> 02:52:06,840
Why is there so much more?

4131
02:52:07,700 --> 02:52:10,120
When does this map get bigger?

4132
02:52:10,120 --> 02:52:10,200
Hey!

4133
02:52:13,900 --> 02:52:16,500
Wait, did the map just got bigger, guys?

4134
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:17,920
I can't...

4135
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:20,120
So that unit belong to Guan Yu.

4136
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:25,380
The great officer can turn the tide of battle with but a handful of men.

4137
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:27,920
Let us proceed with caution.

4138
02:52:28,780 --> 02:52:29,980
And finish off Mubei.

4139
02:52:30,180 --> 02:52:30,920
Post-aste.

4140
02:52:32,700 --> 02:52:33,220
Okay.

4141
02:52:33,220 --> 02:52:34,520
Wait.

4142
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:35,540
Wait.

4143
02:52:35,740 --> 02:52:36,020
Wait.

4144
02:52:36,020 --> 02:52:38,160
The enemy officer has been defeated.

4145
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:42,380
It would seem that fortune has finally deserted us.

4146
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:43,600
Where is he?

4147
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:45,400
Oh, my God.

4148
02:52:47,400 --> 02:52:48,180
Don't worry!

4149
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:56,100
Open the door!

4150
02:52:56,300 --> 02:52:57,600
Open the door!

4151
02:52:58,800 --> 02:53:01,540
We shall fight and survive until Guan Yu comes!

4152
02:53:01,640 --> 02:53:01,680
Brothers!

4153
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:03,600
Brothers!

4154
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:03,660
Brothers!

4155
02:53:04,540 --> 02:53:05,460
I have returned!

4156
02:53:05,580 --> 02:53:07,160
I have returned!

4157
02:53:07,940 --> 02:53:09,160
I have returned!

4158
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:10,820
Me!

4159
02:53:12,820 --> 02:53:15,320
Your fourth brother is here!

4160
02:53:16,060 --> 02:53:17,340
Yes, me!

4161
02:53:26,820 --> 02:53:27,420
Me!

4162
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:27,800
My brother!

4163
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:29,760
You have much to discuss!

4164
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:32,420
But first, let us escape this peril!

4165
02:53:32,540 --> 02:53:34,540
And the enemy officer has been defeated!

4166
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:34,620
We have much to discuss!

4167
02:53:34,620 --> 02:53:34,660
But first, let us escape this peril!

4168
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:36,320
The fourth brother is here, guys!

4169
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:37,260
Me!

4170
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:37,280
Me!

4171
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:41,060
We must continue to fight hard!

4172
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:43,180
We must continue to fight hard!

4173
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:43,560
Lord Liu Bei!

4174
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:45,920
It's good to see you after so long!

4175
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:47,920
My spear is at your service!

4176
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:49,600
More infested!

4177
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,400
The enemy officer has been defeated!

4178
02:53:52,640 --> 02:53:55,180
There's so much plot and if I'm killing so many people!

4179
02:53:56,580 --> 02:53:59,320
The enemy officer has been defeated!

4180
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:01,300
Okay, nice!

4181
02:54:01,900 --> 02:54:06,440
For the brother of my lord, I shall spare no effort!

4182
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:08,800
Oh my god!

4183
02:54:08,940 --> 02:54:11,040
Like 20 different plot lines was here!

4184
02:54:11,500 --> 02:54:11,840
Oh my god!

4185
02:54:11,900 --> 02:54:12,920
And he's still going!

4186
02:54:14,220 --> 02:54:18,620
Let's just say a man who insisted on offering his services!

4187
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:23,640
Literally 20 different plot lines were just shown today!

4188
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:28,660
Alright, nice!

4189
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:29,520
Oh my god, Lupe!

4190
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:30,340
You're almost dead!

4191
02:54:30,660 --> 02:54:32,180
Why did you not eat your bread?!

4192
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:34,000
Everyone!

4193
02:54:35,140 --> 02:54:35,740
Please!

4194
02:54:35,740 --> 02:54:36,800
Eat your bread!

4195
02:54:37,140 --> 02:54:37,800
Stay strong!

4196
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:40,760
Alright, I think I did like a lot though!

4197
02:54:41,340 --> 02:54:43,320
Alright, I completed that!

4198
02:54:43,640 --> 02:54:46,480
I still have yet to do a traumatic success yet!

4199
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:48,240
We're getting there, guys!

4200
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:48,960
We're...

4201
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:51,140
We're slowly getting there!

4202
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:53,060
Alright, I mean I could do...

4203
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:56,020
I'll just get rid of Panton's stupid fucking...

4204
02:54:56,020 --> 02:54:57,600
What is the wheel recovery?

4205
02:54:57,800 --> 02:54:58,480
Is it this?

4206
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:03,380
Like, how do I do the wheel recovery?

4207
02:55:03,580 --> 02:55:04,140
I don't understand!

4208
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:05,840
This area belongs to us now!

4209
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:07,460
Okay, where are we supposed to go, guys?

4210
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:11,660
We're going this way?

4211
02:55:11,800 --> 02:55:12,420
I don't know!

4212
02:55:12,960 --> 02:55:14,540
I don't know where we're supposed to go!

4213
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:17,960
Oh, hit Y when they're...

4214
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:18,520
Oh, okay!

4215
02:55:19,580 --> 02:55:20,360
Alright, I got this!

4216
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:22,160
I got to quit charging into things!

4217
02:55:22,540 --> 02:55:23,520
Take this!

4218
02:55:23,940 --> 02:55:24,120
No!

4219
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:25,880
Okay...

4220
02:55:25,880 --> 02:55:26,460
Oh, shit!

4221
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:30,020
There we go!

4222
02:55:32,180 --> 02:55:32,820
Nice!

4223
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:34,720
I don't know what I'm doing, but nice!

4224
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:39,340
Jesus Christ!

4225
02:55:39,800 --> 02:55:40,680
He's so tanky!

4226
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:41,840
I don't know if like...

4227
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:43,800
If it's because, um...

4228
02:55:44,440 --> 02:55:46,080
Of how weak my weapons are...

4229
02:55:46,080 --> 02:55:48,720
Or if he's just naturally this fucking tanky!

4230
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:50,380
I can never tell anymore!

4231
02:55:53,100 --> 02:55:54,100
Okay, nice!

4232
02:55:55,360 --> 02:55:56,120
That's fine!

4233
02:55:57,780 --> 02:55:59,280
I'm gonna save my...

4234
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:00,760
I'm gonna save my rage meter!

4235
02:56:02,680 --> 02:56:04,440
Guys, I don't think you matter anyway!

4236
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:07,560
Nice!

4237
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:09,620
He's just pretty tanky!

4238
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:10,220
Oh, thank god!

4239
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:11,100
Okay, I couldn't tell!

4240
02:56:11,260 --> 02:56:11,640
Oh my god!

4241
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:12,480
Get outta here!

4242
02:56:12,660 --> 02:56:14,680
Doesn't matter if I break your neck anyway!

4243
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:17,620
The enemy officer enemy's arrival has revitalized the foe!

4244
02:56:18,380 --> 02:56:19,020
We are in danger!

4245
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:22,960
Doesn't matter how tanky you are if I can still break your neck!

4246
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:24,680
We shall stop them there!

4247
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:27,820
Alright!

4248
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:29,560
Nice!

4249
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:31,380
Boom!

4250
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:32,720
I can't believe this!

4251
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:35,100
The enemy officer has been defeated!

4252
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:36,580
Alright, fast track!

4253
02:56:36,860 --> 02:56:37,380
You call that an officer?

4254
02:56:40,780 --> 02:56:41,480
Okay!

4255
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:44,720
One day I'll figure out how to do a dramatic success tactic!

4256
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:46,120
One day!

4257
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:48,220
But today is not that day!

4258
02:56:51,450 --> 02:56:54,200
Today is sadly not that day, guys!

4259
02:56:54,700 --> 02:56:55,380
Great!

4260
02:56:56,760 --> 02:56:59,420
But one day I'll figure it out!

4261
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,340
Okay, nice!

4262
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:02,920
Jesus!

4263
02:57:03,320 --> 02:57:03,740
Oh no!

4264
02:57:08,220 --> 02:57:08,820
Oh no!

4265
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:08,960
Oh no!

4266
02:57:08,960 --> 02:57:10,120
There's so many things going on!

4267
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:10,840
Oh no!

4268
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:12,080
That's...

4269
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:12,620
Yeah, exactly!

4270
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:14,540
That's future Doki's problem!

4271
02:57:17,240 --> 02:57:17,680
Nice!

4272
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:20,400
Oh my god!

4273
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:22,300
I killed a lot of people that was there!

4274
02:57:30,400 --> 02:57:31,560
Oh my god!

4275
02:57:32,180 --> 02:57:32,560
Oh wait!

4276
02:57:32,620 --> 02:57:33,220
Is he the boss?

4277
02:57:33,400 --> 02:57:34,160
Oh he's the boss!

4278
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:35,880
Okay, how much more?

4279
02:57:37,060 --> 02:57:37,780
Complete it!

4280
02:57:37,900 --> 02:57:38,540
Complete it!

4281
02:57:39,620 --> 02:57:39,660
Complete it!

4282
02:57:39,740 --> 02:57:41,000
Wait, where's Pantong?

4283
02:57:41,400 --> 02:57:42,460
Did I not do it?

4284
02:57:42,860 --> 02:57:43,920
Oh my god!

4285
02:57:44,700 --> 02:57:45,240
Fuck this!

4286
02:57:46,060 --> 02:57:47,040
I give up!

4287
02:57:49,060 --> 02:57:50,520
I give up already!

4288
02:57:50,860 --> 02:57:51,560
Fuck it!

4289
02:57:51,900 --> 02:57:53,000
I'm using ice!

4290
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,720
I hope...

4291
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,180
I do not!

4292
02:57:57,100 --> 02:57:57,680
I...

4293
02:57:57,680 --> 02:57:59,480
Have chosen my path!

4294
02:57:59,680 --> 02:57:59,960
Gotcha!

4295
02:58:02,120 --> 02:58:03,500
I was at...

4296
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:03,680
Guys!

4297
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:05,640
The thing is, I was at 25!

4298
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:09,700
Nice!

4299
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:22,460
Do I hit him?

4300
02:58:24,380 --> 02:58:25,420
Oh, I do!

4301
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:28,720
Alright, who's gonna...

4302
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:31,920
Am I gonna finish this fight before the plot is done?

4303
02:58:32,100 --> 02:58:32,400
Yes!

4304
02:58:32,860 --> 02:58:34,040
I actually...

4305
02:58:34,040 --> 02:58:36,420
I killed him before they were finished talking!

4306
02:58:37,060 --> 02:58:37,760
Alright, oops!

4307
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:38,640
Sorry guys!

4308
02:58:39,580 --> 02:58:41,100
Finished it too early!

4309
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:42,460
Unlimited potential.

4310
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:46,780
One slight underestimation on our part could lead to our destruction.

4311
02:58:47,120 --> 02:58:48,100
Don't bother us...

4312
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:48,220
No!

4313
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:51,900
But the training is how I romance the Generals!

4314
02:58:54,460 --> 02:58:56,060
I'm too strong for the plot!

4315
02:58:56,080 --> 02:58:58,300
You have your family safely accompanying us too!

4316
02:58:59,060 --> 02:58:59,680
Ah!

4317
02:59:00,260 --> 02:59:00,840
My thanks!

4318
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:02,900
You have protected them well!

4319
02:59:03,420 --> 02:59:03,640
Lube!

4320
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:06,260
Were you even thinking about your child and your...

4321
02:59:06,260 --> 02:59:06,620
Your wife?

4322
02:59:07,560 --> 02:59:08,440
More than anything!

4323
02:59:09,160 --> 02:59:10,320
I am thankful for that!

4324
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:12,980
Now...

4325
02:59:12,980 --> 02:59:13,760
Looking rough!

4326
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:16,900
Tell me a tale or two...

4327
02:59:16,900 --> 02:59:18,540
They won't let me pay him!

4328
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:20,040
That's the worst part!

4329
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:21,880
I'm trying!

4330
02:59:23,380 --> 02:59:26,940
I've been trying to pay him this entire time!

4331
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:29,260
He won't let me!

4332
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:37,000
All right...

4333
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:37,600
Let's see...

4334
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:38,460
Greater...

4335
02:59:38,460 --> 02:59:38,800
Boost...

4336
02:59:40,180 --> 02:59:40,860
Defense...

4337
02:59:40,860 --> 02:59:41,340
Alright...

4338
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:43,000
I definitely need more health recovery...

4339
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:43,360
Fuck that!

4340
02:59:48,440 --> 02:59:49,980
He won't let me!

4341
02:59:50,200 --> 02:59:51,360
I wanna get closer!

4342
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:54,240
But he won't let me!

4343
02:59:54,740 --> 02:59:55,560
Thou whore!

4344
02:59:56,940 --> 02:59:58,800
There must be someone else.

4345
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:00,940
It is good to have you two back with us.

4346
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:03,360
We shall meet again.

4347
03:00:04,180 --> 03:00:07,360
I made it a mantra until we were reunited.

4348
03:00:07,960 --> 03:00:11,500
And now, I will make my oath to you once more.

4349
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:17,680
From this day onward, I will dedicate my life to clearing the path for Rise of Liu Bei.

4350
03:00:19,980 --> 03:00:21,600
To a brighter future.

4351
03:00:22,140 --> 03:00:23,140
Thank you both.

4352
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:28,080
So you didn't decide to abandon me.

4353
03:00:29,220 --> 03:00:30,080
That's a relief.

4354
03:00:30,840 --> 03:00:32,820
And not just for you, brother.

4355
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:37,500
I'd had just about enough of him asking, are they back yet?

4356
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:39,340
Every time he saw me.

4357
03:00:39,980 --> 03:00:44,700
If you'd left me alone with him much longer, I might have given him a good smack on the head.

4358
03:00:44,820 --> 03:00:46,020
Oh, just like his son.

4359
03:00:48,220 --> 03:00:49,640
That's where he got it from.

4360
03:00:52,120 --> 03:00:52,640
Okay, it took this guy like 20 years to catch them.

4361
03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:56,020
I don't even have a place to call home.

4362
03:00:57,400 --> 03:00:59,340
But what brings you all this way?

4363
03:01:00,060 --> 03:01:02,380
I have come to lend you my aid, Lord Liu Bei.

4364
03:01:02,740 --> 03:01:04,080
I wish to serve under you.

4365
03:01:05,640 --> 03:01:06,040
Me?

4366
03:01:07,380 --> 03:01:09,380
I don't even have a place to call home.

4367
03:01:09,880 --> 03:01:12,000
Why would you wish to serve a vagrant?

4368
03:01:12,460 --> 03:01:13,340
Because of who you are.

4369
03:01:13,820 --> 03:01:15,080
Is that not reason enough?

4370
03:01:15,900 --> 03:01:16,920
Well, I...

4371
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:20,500
Okay, it took this guy like 20 years to catch the horse thief.

4372
03:01:20,640 --> 03:01:20,680
My lord!

4373
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:22,280
Don't forget about me!

4374
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:24,740
He's like, I don't know him.

4375
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:25,720
My lord.

4376
03:01:27,340 --> 03:01:30,040
Brother, allow me to introduce.

4377
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:33,960
Ron Yu's top underling, Jill Sung, at your service.

4378
03:01:34,380 --> 03:01:39,100
I admire him so much that I followed him and begged him until he took me under his weight.

4379
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:40,900
I see.

4380
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:43,720
That sounds like quite the story.

4381
03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:45,560
My lord!

4382
03:01:46,120 --> 03:01:48,220
Well, we should have let all this excitement go to waste.

4383
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:51,380
Brothers, fetch the wine.

4384
03:01:51,820 --> 03:01:54,160
Tonight, we welcome our friends with a feast.

4385
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:01,100
I just realized...

4386
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:04,500
If I play the other chapters...

4387
03:02:05,340 --> 03:02:07,720
I have to kill Lu Bu again.

4388
03:02:10,120 --> 03:02:11,640
Guys, I don't know anymore.

4389
03:02:11,640 --> 03:02:12,180
I...

4390
03:02:15,300 --> 03:02:22,220
Guys, am I really strong enough to kill Lu Bu a second and third time?

4391
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:31,440
It'll be easier.

4392
03:02:32,520 --> 03:02:35,360
I, for some reason, I don't trust you guys.

4393
03:02:38,560 --> 03:02:40,100
How distant they are.

4394
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:41,980
Those stars in the sky.

4395
03:02:44,660 --> 03:02:45,300
Wow.

4396
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:47,200
It's so romantic, guys.

4397
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:53,660
Compared to them, the distance between men seems trivial.

4398
03:02:55,860 --> 03:03:00,900
It is your open-heartedness that makes you feel so.

4399
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:05,340
Don't deny your destiny!

4400
03:03:08,640 --> 03:03:11,060
I don't know, dad surely didn't.

4401
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:15,480
That's why he's in fucking doggy jail right now.

4402
03:03:15,480 --> 03:03:15,520
What's up?

4403
03:03:20,060 --> 03:03:20,520
I...

4404
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:21,080
Thank you.

4405
03:03:21,500 --> 03:03:22,220
All of you.

4406
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:26,480
Though I cannot offer you compensation at this time.

4407
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:29,400
I shall swear to you again.

4408
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:34,680
Together, we shall journey throughout this vast land.

4409
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:35,840
We shall!

4410
03:03:37,240 --> 03:03:37,720
Yay!

4411
03:03:44,010 --> 03:03:45,410
Oh, we finished chapter four!

4412
03:03:45,650 --> 03:03:46,990
Wait, how many chapters was there again?

4413
03:03:47,130 --> 03:03:47,770
Was it two more?

4414
03:03:48,710 --> 03:03:50,790
We weren't joking about no hidden infrared hair.

4415
03:03:50,930 --> 03:03:51,950
You should totally unlock it.

4416
03:03:52,070 --> 03:03:54,090
It's your destiny warrior piece.

4417
03:03:54,590 --> 03:03:56,270
The shame Lu Bu.

4418
03:03:56,710 --> 03:03:58,850
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

4419
03:03:59,030 --> 03:03:59,330
Thank you.

4420
03:03:59,490 --> 03:03:59,990
Thank you.

4421
03:04:01,030 --> 03:04:02,150
Oh, it's five chapters?

4422
03:04:02,270 --> 03:04:03,690
Wait, there's five chapters left?

4423
03:04:03,690 --> 03:04:04,290
Or...

4424
03:04:04,290 --> 03:04:05,530
This is the last chapter?

4425
03:04:08,450 --> 03:04:10,950
We're at the last- Oh, how long is the last chapter?

4426
03:04:11,350 --> 03:04:13,290
From a decisive battle with Yuan Shao.

4427
03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:16,930
Becoming the most powerful individual in the land.

4428
03:04:17,650 --> 03:04:21,290
He actively strove to establish hegemony over Hu Bei.

4429
03:04:21,590 --> 03:04:24,290
And in turn, the entire land.

4430
03:04:25,030 --> 03:04:27,570
The Sun clan fell into turmoil.

4431
03:04:28,390 --> 03:04:31,190
After being tragically deprived of their war once again.

4432
03:04:31,630 --> 03:04:31,710
Oh, Sun Se is dead.

4433
03:04:31,710 --> 03:04:36,830
However, with their combination of capable youth and dependable seniority...

4434
03:04:36,830 --> 03:04:37,930
Don't worry, he still has his roommate.

4435
03:04:38,330 --> 03:04:39,230
Oh, my God!

4436
03:04:39,470 --> 03:04:39,870
The roommate's...

4437
03:04:40,370 --> 03:04:40,690
His...

4438
03:04:40,690 --> 03:04:42,090
The roommate's ex died!

4439
03:04:42,550 --> 03:04:44,870
Their future now lay in the hands of their young leader.

4440
03:04:46,070 --> 03:04:47,710
Joe Yu was like...

4441
03:04:47,710 --> 03:04:48,770
My new roommate.

4442
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:52,570
And could not realistically attempt to gain supremacy.

4443
03:04:53,710 --> 03:04:54,350
But...

4444
03:04:54,350 --> 03:04:58,130
He focused on gaining something worthwhile out of his indecision.

4445
03:04:59,570 --> 03:05:03,350
The turbulent sea of the era turned into a powerful whirlpool.

4446
03:05:04,030 --> 03:05:05,190
And before long...

4447
03:05:05,190 --> 03:05:05,590
Oh, my God!

4448
03:05:05,990 --> 03:05:06,450
My Oshi!

4449
03:05:06,670 --> 03:05:07,810
My Oshi is right there!

4450
03:05:09,870 --> 03:05:10,950
Chapter 5.

4451
03:05:11,350 --> 03:05:13,150
With Chuga Liang's assistance...

4452
03:05:13,150 --> 03:05:13,630
Chuga Liang?

4453
03:05:13,890 --> 03:05:16,430
Liu Bei decides on a plan to gain power.

4454
03:05:16,490 --> 03:05:17,330
Oh, my God!

4455
03:05:17,470 --> 03:05:18,170
My Oshi!

4456
03:05:19,330 --> 03:05:20,430
There he is!

4457
03:05:23,730 --> 03:05:24,330
Yes!

4458
03:05:24,330 --> 03:05:24,750
Wow, Oshi!

4459
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:33,040
Oh, my God!

4460
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:35,440
Both sides struggled to gain an advantage at Guandu.

4461
03:05:35,660 --> 03:05:36,960
But in the end...

4462
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:40,920
Yuan Xiao's forces were crushed after Tao Tao raided their storehouse.

4463
03:05:41,620 --> 03:05:43,500
With no hope of recovery...

4464
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:46,540
Lord Yuan Xiao eventually succumbed to illness.

4465
03:05:47,340 --> 03:05:48,180
I see.

4466
03:05:49,900 --> 03:05:54,720
I owed Lord Yuan Xiao a great debt of gratitude for helping me when I most needed it.

4467
03:05:54,720 --> 03:05:56,480
Oh, Yuen Shao's dead.

4468
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:58,600
I never got a chance to complete his training.

4469
03:06:00,400 --> 03:06:01,640
Or him to repay him.

4470
03:06:09,440 --> 03:06:13,300
Oh, he's wearing green now.

4471
03:06:13,640 --> 03:06:14,460
That's funny.

4472
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:52,480
Huh?

4473
03:06:52,780 --> 03:06:52,780
You don't know?

4474
03:06:52,780 --> 03:06:52,780
Huh?

4475
03:06:53,500 --> 03:06:54,480
You don't know?

4476
03:06:56,960 --> 03:07:00,140
I'm changing so fast that I'm having trouble keeping up.

4477
03:07:00,800 --> 03:07:02,140
Hey, come on.

4478
03:07:02,400 --> 03:07:03,240
Don't give up now.

4479
03:07:04,580 --> 03:07:08,940
Wait, Zhou Zhan, Zhao Yun, you two have any ideas that can help?

4480
03:07:08,940 --> 03:07:12,440
Okay, they're not strateg... We don't have a single strategist here.

4481
03:07:12,660 --> 03:07:14,140
We're all like, unga bunga.

4482
03:07:14,840 --> 03:07:16,800
All right, Lupe, it's time to get to Kotlin.

4483
03:07:17,400 --> 03:07:19,600
We actually have zero strategist here.

4484
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:23,340
I'm afraid I'm no more helpful than he is.

4485
03:07:25,260 --> 03:07:26,800
We're all in muscle heads.

4486
03:07:26,980 --> 03:07:29,000
Unga bunga is the strategy.

4487
03:07:30,740 --> 03:07:32,200
Bro, I barely talk.

4488
03:07:34,660 --> 03:07:35,140
Uh...

4489
03:07:35,140 --> 03:07:36,100
Uh...

4490
03:07:37,160 --> 03:07:39,300
You can't even look me in the eye.

4491
03:07:39,800 --> 03:07:42,520
If you don't have any ideas, just say so.

4492
03:07:43,400 --> 03:07:47,640
You know, I think this conversation may have shown me what is holding us back.

4493
03:07:47,800 --> 03:07:48,400
Oh, you think?

4494
03:07:48,780 --> 03:07:51,120
Brother, what we need is a guide.

4495
03:07:52,340 --> 03:07:53,860
A man of wisdom.

4496
03:07:53,980 --> 03:07:56,100
We had none of that this entire time.

4497
03:07:56,320 --> 03:07:58,320
It took four chapters to realize this.

4498
03:08:02,020 --> 03:08:02,900
We actually...

4499
03:08:02,900 --> 03:08:05,640
Chaochao has like ten of them, and we have zero.

4500
03:08:06,160 --> 03:08:08,500
That's where we can find someone with the skills we need.

4501
03:08:10,240 --> 03:08:12,200
Do you think heading that way would be a good idea?

4502
03:08:12,280 --> 03:08:12,820
That's actually crazy.

4503
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,020
Chaochao's literally surrounded by strategists.

4504
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:15,760
Are you serious?

4505
03:08:16,200 --> 03:08:19,580
How can we go anywhere right now when we've got the castle here in Runan?

4506
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:21,580
You're right.

4507
03:08:22,740 --> 03:08:24,380
I'm sorry, forget I mentioned it.

4508
03:08:25,620 --> 03:08:28,020
Perhaps some ideas are best left unsaid.

4509
03:08:37,330 --> 03:08:37,770
Alright.

4510
03:08:38,150 --> 03:08:38,390
Ooh!

4511
03:08:38,970 --> 03:08:40,350
I need to tell you something.

4512
03:08:40,770 --> 03:08:43,630
I'm looking forward to seeing you around, but let me tell you why I'm writing.

4513
03:08:43,910 --> 03:08:45,850
There's something I'm raring to show off to you.

4514
03:08:45,850 --> 03:08:47,150
I'm wearing it right now.

4515
03:08:47,590 --> 03:08:51,530
My new outfit designed especially to match with Lord Guan Yun.

4516
03:08:51,850 --> 03:08:55,830
Ever since I met him during my days fighting for the yellow turbanes.

4517
03:08:55,930 --> 03:08:57,330
I dreamed of that day.

4518
03:08:57,490 --> 03:08:58,650
That's such a great...

4519
03:08:58,650 --> 03:09:00,070
Why is he telling me this?

4520
03:09:00,570 --> 03:09:01,050
Like...

4521
03:09:02,890 --> 03:09:04,790
Why is he telling me this?

4522
03:09:05,030 --> 03:09:07,510
So I got this made to look just like him.

4523
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:10,550
But a little bit of my own personal flair, of course.

4524
03:09:10,830 --> 03:09:15,330
Now, I know all the thought I put in this may come off as a tad disturbing.

4525
03:09:15,330 --> 03:09:16,410
I get it.

4526
03:09:16,550 --> 03:09:17,590
I really do.

4527
03:09:18,490 --> 03:09:21,330
That's why you're the only person I can practice it.

4528
03:09:21,390 --> 03:09:22,690
Because you know what it's like.

4529
03:09:23,610 --> 03:09:26,890
I mean, I'll take it all in with my word and just smile instead of teasing me about it, right?

4530
03:09:27,230 --> 03:09:31,650
Oh, the next time we meet, you can have all the time you want to admire it.

4531
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:33,390
He's like, I know who you are.

4532
03:09:35,630 --> 03:09:39,330
You seem to have the ability to land unharmed when dropping from high places.

4533
03:09:39,610 --> 03:09:43,030
I wager for you would be fine falling from just about anything you climb.

4534
03:09:43,270 --> 03:09:44,230
Your sense of...

4535
03:09:44,230 --> 03:09:44,490
Okay.

4536
03:09:45,310 --> 03:09:46,510
This doesn't matter.

4537
03:09:46,510 --> 03:09:48,670
I was glad to see that you're in good health.

4538
03:09:48,790 --> 03:09:53,070
And I'm grateful to once again have the honor of meeting you in the service of Lord Lupe.

4539
03:09:53,330 --> 03:09:54,770
It has been too long.

4540
03:09:54,910 --> 03:09:57,210
So I thought we might have a nice talk to catch up on things.

4541
03:09:57,490 --> 03:09:59,990
If you would like, I can come to where you are.

4542
03:10:00,230 --> 03:10:01,570
This is so much I want to tell you.

4543
03:10:01,710 --> 03:10:01,950
Yay!

4544
03:10:02,730 --> 03:10:03,090
Finally!

4545
03:10:03,090 --> 03:10:06,230
The real good part about this game.

4546
03:10:08,230 --> 03:10:09,690
Oh my god.

4547
03:10:10,570 --> 03:10:11,130
Finally!

4548
03:10:11,950 --> 03:10:13,570
The real content, guys.

4549
03:10:17,270 --> 03:10:18,550
The good stuff.

4550
03:10:22,390 --> 03:10:22,910
Alright.

4551
03:10:23,070 --> 03:10:24,410
Oh wait, but Lupe wants to talk too.

4552
03:10:24,610 --> 03:10:25,750
But Zhao Yun has a bond.

4553
03:10:27,810 --> 03:10:28,850
Alright, Zhao Yun.

4554
03:10:28,910 --> 03:10:29,770
What do you want to talk about?

4555
03:10:30,690 --> 03:10:32,230
The real content.

4556
03:10:32,430 --> 03:10:33,330
Fading to black.

4557
03:10:37,430 --> 03:10:39,650
I feel embarrassed to bring this up now.

4558
03:10:39,970 --> 03:10:42,510
But there's something I've wanted to ask you to return.

4559
03:10:42,830 --> 03:10:43,310
What?

4560
03:10:43,750 --> 03:10:44,470
My heart.

4561
03:10:46,490 --> 03:10:47,370
You mean.

4562
03:10:48,270 --> 03:10:48,830
Peace.

4563
03:10:48,830 --> 03:10:49,770
What peace of your heart.

4564
03:10:50,330 --> 03:10:54,150
The feelings I expressed to you in the hope that you would be drawn to Lord Lupe.

4565
03:10:55,930 --> 03:10:58,710
I now realize I was being melodramatic.

4566
03:10:59,170 --> 03:11:01,890
I would appreciate it if you would forget about what happened.

4567
03:11:03,930 --> 03:11:05,590
That's not right again.

4568
03:11:06,590 --> 03:11:07,690
Ever since then.

4569
03:11:08,070 --> 03:11:09,650
Even separated from you.

4570
03:11:10,110 --> 03:11:12,330
I could feel that my heart was like you.

4571
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:13,210
However.

4572
03:11:13,370 --> 03:11:14,410
You no longer need it.

4573
03:11:14,610 --> 03:11:18,130
Since you've entered Lord Luube's service, my wish has been fulfilled.

4574
03:11:20,630 --> 03:11:23,270
We have become true comrades now.

4575
03:11:25,970 --> 03:11:26,890
Oh my god.

4576
03:11:27,190 --> 03:11:29,410
His heart was missing me.

4577
03:11:29,630 --> 03:11:31,630
That's why I'm wearing his armory, guys.

4578
03:11:31,630 --> 03:11:35,370
Even on my travels, news of his troubles reached me.

4579
03:11:37,770 --> 03:11:40,610
Guys, this is exactly why I'm wearing his army!

4580
03:11:43,150 --> 03:11:43,710
Okay,

4581
03:11:51,090 --> 03:11:52,310
why are we still talking about Lube?

4582
03:11:52,670 --> 03:11:53,430
It's you and me!

4583
03:11:54,570 --> 03:11:55,130
Sorry!

4584
03:11:55,570 --> 03:11:56,470
Us and him!

4585
03:11:56,750 --> 03:11:57,950
Us and him!

4586
03:12:03,930 --> 03:12:05,610
Let me thank you once again.

4587
03:12:06,030 --> 03:12:08,390
You honored my wishes faithfully.

4588
03:12:10,950 --> 03:12:13,710
At last, I'm ready to join you.

4589
03:12:16,890 --> 03:12:17,930
Yes, us!

4590
03:12:18,070 --> 03:12:18,870
You and I!

4591
03:12:19,210 --> 03:12:20,010
Us and him!

4592
03:12:26,400 --> 03:12:28,380
Together, we can do this!

4593
03:12:32,460 --> 03:12:36,420
Oh, we're making progress in our relationship, guys!

4594
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:38,000
We're moving in together!

4595
03:12:38,460 --> 03:12:43,560
Why is it that Lord Lube feels more inspiring to me?

4596
03:12:43,720 --> 03:12:45,680
Me and you and your Lord Lube!

4597
03:12:48,080 --> 03:12:49,540
Okay, we can share.

4598
03:12:51,260 --> 03:12:56,280
Here alongside him stand Lord Guan Yu, Lord Zongfei, and you.

4599
03:12:59,200 --> 03:13:01,820
Yes, this is what I've been seeking.

4600
03:13:02,860 --> 03:13:04,140
I'm sure of it.

4601
03:13:06,860 --> 03:13:11,260
I hope one day, I can put this feeling into words.

4602
03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:15,280
If that day comes, you will be the first to hear about him.

4603
03:13:15,280 --> 03:13:18,560
I'll be the first one to hear about his feelings too!

4604
03:13:22,080 --> 03:13:24,540
Holy shit, what the fuck?

4605
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:26,400
No, I didn't...

4606
03:13:26,400 --> 03:13:27,620
He literally...

4607
03:13:27,620 --> 03:13:32,300
He literally was like, I'm here for my heart.

4608
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:34,240
What the fuck?

4609
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:38,000
Holy shit, I was not ready for that.

4610
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:41,760
I said that as a joke, guys.

4611
03:13:42,100 --> 03:13:44,220
I said that as a joke.

4612
03:13:44,920 --> 03:13:46,420
They know they're dark.

4613
03:13:46,860 --> 03:13:47,780
Wowza!

4614
03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:52,180
That's crazy.

4615
03:13:52,880 --> 03:13:53,360
It's you.

4616
03:13:53,560 --> 03:13:55,120
That's actually crazy.

4617
03:14:00,680 --> 03:14:03,280
That's the most case ever.

4618
03:14:04,880 --> 03:14:07,620
I threw the fact that he...

4619
03:14:07,620 --> 03:14:08,520
Okay, I think...

4620
03:14:09,300 --> 03:14:13,560
I think that was a good time to stop it.

4621
03:14:14,320 --> 03:14:18,280
Next stream will be the stream where we finally finish...

4622
03:14:19,100 --> 03:14:20,460
the Shu...

4623
03:14:21,540 --> 03:14:23,320
Dynasty Warriors arc.

4624
03:14:23,560 --> 03:14:26,580
And then we can close this chapter.

4625
03:14:28,500 --> 03:14:32,360
That is a good way to end that from today's stream.

4626
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:35,300
Next stream will be the final part.

4627
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:37,020
I'm gonna ask for...

4628
03:14:37,020 --> 03:14:40,660
I'm gonna put a poll up on what time for the final stream.

4629
03:14:40,840 --> 03:14:45,920
But since it is the final stream, maybe I'll put it at my other time slot, the 5pm PSC.

4630
03:14:46,100 --> 03:14:47,800
I know there's some people that have been watching...

4631
03:14:47,800 --> 03:14:49,520
Like, some Eeyongans have been watching at 1230.

4632
03:14:49,740 --> 03:14:51,120
So I will do a...

4633
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:54,280
I'm gonna put a poll up to figure out the time slot for the final part.

4634
03:14:54,480 --> 03:14:58,060
Because, like, I'm just thinking of, like, the Asia Dragoons.

4635
03:14:58,160 --> 03:14:59,420
We wanna watch the final part.

4636
03:15:00,240 --> 03:15:00,760
Um...

4637
03:15:00,760 --> 03:15:02,800
But yes, um...

4638
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:05,720
I'll put a poll up later tonight on the time slot.

4639
03:15:06,240 --> 03:15:07,400
So, um...

4640
03:15:07,400 --> 03:15:10,420
The next part will be the final part for Dynasty Warriors.

4641
03:15:11,860 --> 03:15:12,380
Uh...

4642
03:15:12,380 --> 03:15:13,120
Hey guys!

4643
03:15:13,320 --> 03:15:14,200
That was fun.

4644
03:15:14,340 --> 03:15:15,120
That was really fun.

4645
03:15:15,260 --> 03:15:16,360
I had a great time.

4646
03:15:16,360 --> 03:15:17,100
NotSoDeadpool.

4647
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:18,120
Thank you for the super chat.

4648
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:18,820
Thank you.

4649
03:15:18,880 --> 03:15:21,540
It has strategized knight formations with most generals.

4650
03:15:21,980 --> 03:15:22,100
And...

4651
03:15:22,100 --> 03:15:22,700
Um...

4652
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:22,960
We!

4653
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:24,320
Not just me.

4654
03:15:24,540 --> 03:15:24,880
We!

4655
03:15:25,860 --> 03:15:26,340
Uh...

4656
03:15:26,340 --> 03:15:27,260
Thank you for the super chat.

4657
03:15:27,400 --> 03:15:27,660
Thank you.

4658
03:15:27,780 --> 03:15:28,320
Thank you.

4659
03:15:28,880 --> 03:15:29,800
Oh my god.

4660
03:15:30,080 --> 03:15:31,800
Anyway, that was a good wave.

4661
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:32,900
You know how we were like...

4662
03:15:32,900 --> 03:15:33,780
I was like, man!

4663
03:15:34,200 --> 03:15:36,540
Where's the actual content, guys?

4664
03:15:36,720 --> 03:15:37,840
Like, I'm...

4665
03:15:38,360 --> 03:15:39,560
We were like...

4666
03:15:39,560 --> 03:15:40,360
Aw, man!

4667
03:15:40,360 --> 03:15:41,900
I feel like...

4668
03:15:41,900 --> 03:15:44,080
We're missing out on the real content.

4669
03:15:44,360 --> 03:15:45,560
And then it didn't...

4670
03:15:45,560 --> 03:15:46,680
It didn't disappoint.

4671
03:15:47,080 --> 03:15:48,880
It didn't disappoint at the end.

4672
03:15:49,060 --> 03:15:50,560
The end was where...

4673
03:15:50,560 --> 03:15:51,520
It was...

4674
03:15:52,580 --> 03:15:53,700
Where they...

4675
03:15:53,700 --> 03:15:55,240
The build up to the end.

4676
03:15:55,380 --> 03:15:57,440
For the actual good content.

4677
03:15:57,840 --> 03:15:58,640
That's what we're...

4678
03:15:58,640 --> 03:15:59,200
That's...

4679
03:15:59,200 --> 03:16:00,940
That's what I'm talking about.

4680
03:16:01,180 --> 03:16:02,620
That's what we've been waiting for.

4681
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:06,440
Hey guys!

4682
03:16:06,660 --> 03:16:07,680
As always, everybody.

4683
03:16:07,960 --> 03:16:08,780
Stay hydrated.

4684
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:09,540
Pause your check.

4685
03:16:09,540 --> 03:16:10,580
Get up and move around.

4686
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:11,600
To get that blood flowing.

4687
03:16:11,800 --> 03:16:12,920
And if you step for me...

4688
03:16:12,920 --> 03:16:13,440
Head to bed.

4689
03:16:13,560 --> 03:16:13,960
Cause...

4690
03:16:13,960 --> 03:16:14,720
You deserve it.

4691
03:16:14,860 --> 03:16:16,100
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4692
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:17,180
Bye guys!

4693
03:16:17,500 --> 03:16:17,900
Bye!
