00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,030
Hello!

2
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,430
Good morning everybody!

3
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,750
Sorry, we looted because I wanted to put on the pilot hat.

4
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,560
Sorry, the only reason why we looted was I was like, oh my god!

5
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,400
I should put on a hat!

6
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,540
And I was trying to find a hat.

7
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,160
I was trying to find a hat for the immersion!

8
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,760
I was trying to find a hat and that's why we looted today.

9
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
It's important!

10
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,840
The hat was so important!

11
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
You guys don't understand!

12
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,560
How can I be a real pilot if I don't have the hat?

13
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,360
Also, oh my god!

14
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Lemo, thank you for the 50 gifted chips!

15
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,020
Thank you!

16
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Guys, I'm so incredibly tired.

17
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,260
I'm so... I... I...

18
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,140
I...

19
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,380
I was like, I could do 11.30.

20
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,520
It's just like 12.30 but like an hour earlier.

21
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,140
And then I woke up at 11.15 and I was like realizing it's not like 12.30.

22
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,160
I woke up like, oh... it's not like 12.30.

23
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,640
It's... why?

24
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,400
It's so much worse.

25
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,080
So...

26
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,740
So... good morning, everybody!

27
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,720
Good morning!

28
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:29,980
The reason why... The reason why my stream is an hour earlier is because I have a meeting with YouTube!

29
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,540
I was... Originally I had a meeting with YouTube to just like be like welcoming me on YouTube.

30
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,660
Or like welcoming me back on YouTube.

31
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,140
So...

32
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:49,100
So, originally, originally, I was supposed to meet with the YouTube people, like, maybe a month ago.

33
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,360
But then, because of daylight savings, the meeting got scuffed.

34
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,780
Like, it got really scuffed, so we had to postpone it.

35
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,940
Because we weren't able to attend the meeting because of daylight savings a month ago.

36
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,680
And now, like, our schedules lined up.

37
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,640
Our schedules finally lined up today.

38
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,940
So, I was like... it was a debate.

39
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,060
I was like, do I do this... I didn't miss it!

40
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,000
I didn't miss it!

41
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,900
Our meetings got, like, super scuffed up.

42
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,240
Okay, I'm just gonna say it was daylight savings time, but I didn't miss it.

43
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,380
We just had to reschedule it.

44
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,680
So, we had to reschedule it.

45
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,360
And today's the day I get to meet Mr. YouTube himself.

46
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,740
Oh my god, a real person.

47
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,480
I think, like, one of the funniest...

48
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,140
Like, first... the first email we got from YouTube was like, Hello!

49
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,580
I'm a real person.

50
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,300
I remember, like, when my manager sent me the email, it was like, Oh hey, YouTube wants to meet you.

51
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,020
And then, like, I think the first or second sentence was like, Hi, I'm a real person.

52
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,660
But I really... I like the... our YouTube guy.

53
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,060
He's really nice.

54
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,480
Because, like, I had issues.

55
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,040
I don't know if I told you guys, but, like, the second channel thing was solved.

56
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,980
Like, my Twitch... my Twitch vlogs channel.

57
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,560
There was an issue with my Twitch vlogs channel.

58
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,360
Did I... did I tell this in the members?

59
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,280
I told this in the members, right?

60
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,640
Okay.

61
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,620
Did I tell this in the members or... members.

62
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,480
Yes, I told this in the members.

63
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,620
It's because I... I leaked something in the members.

64
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:49,600
So, for those who are not in the members... in the members stream, what happened was that my Twitch vlogs channel...

65
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
Look, everything, like, blurs together.

66
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,800
Like, all... my entire life has been, like, stream...

67
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,960
Like, I feel like... like, a lot... I feel like majority of my brain space has just been, like, filled up with streaming stuff.

68
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,820
That I don't know what is what anymore.

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,980
I don't know.

70
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,840
I was like, did I say this in the members?

71
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,080
Did I say this in my past channel?

72
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,600
Did I say this in my current channel?

73
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm like, I don't know what I said.

74
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,720
Did I say this in my past channel, members?

75
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,320
I can't remember.

76
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,080
There's too many things to take into account now.

77
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,320
It's getting more complicated.

78
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,820
It's getting so much more complicated now.

79
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,200
So...

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,960
So, anyway...

81
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,060
So, anyway...

82
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,000
Basically, what happened...

83
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,760
For those who are, like, super confused and are like, oh, what happened?

84
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,220
Basically, my Twitch vlogs channel...

85
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,360
Basically, my Twitch vlogs channel...

86
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,220
It was, like...

87
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,900
It succeeded in monetization.

88
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,580
Not for, like, ads yet.

89
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,300
I still need, like, I think, like, 30 more hours of watch time.

90
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,660
30 more hours of watch time.

91
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,480
Hint, hint.

92
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,240
To get to be able to monetize via ads.

93
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,220
But I can turn on super chats and members in my second Twitch...

94
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,140
Sorry, my second YouTube channel.

95
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,800
Which I won't do because I think that's a little stupid because it's a VODS channel.

96
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,380
But I wanted to, like, make sure my...

97
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,400
Make sure it's already approved for monetization already.

98
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,120
So, like, just to be, like...

99
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Just to do it in advance.

100
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,280
And...

101
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,580
And then...

102
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,160
So, I applied for monetization on my Twitch VODS...

103
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
My VODS channel.

104
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,360
And then...

105
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,400
And then...

106
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,700
I got rejected.

107
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,540
And I was, like...

108
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,820
I was, like...

109
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,560
What?

110
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,400
Why did I get rejected?

111
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,340
It's...

112
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,660
It's a VODS channel.

113
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,480
So, I looked at the requirements.

114
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,140
And then the requirements was, like...

115
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,060
They, like...

116
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,100
Why did they reject me?

117
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
And then, apparently, one of them was that...

118
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
They didn't know if it was me.

119
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,920
Or it was, like, an impersonation.

120
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,700
Or something.

121
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,720
Like, they thought, like...

122
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,580
Oh, somebody was...

123
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,200
Might be impersonating me.

124
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,920
And they're, like...

125
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh, if you're gonna re-upload somebody else's content...

126
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,700
You gotta make sure it has, like, different things on there.

127
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,940
Like, you gotta make it your own.

128
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,840
You gotta edit it in a way that's your own.

129
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,420
And I was, like...

130
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,100
What the fuck?

131
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,640
So...

132
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,760
So, they're, like...

133
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
Okay, if you wanna send an appeal...

134
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,760
Prove that this is you.

135
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,720
And so, I was, like...

136
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,460
Okay...

137
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm gonna, I guess...

138
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,500
Cause I know you can monetize VOD's channel...

139
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,540
Due to, like, my experiences.

140
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,660
My previous experiences.

141
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,980
I know you can monetize, like...

142
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,780
VOD's channel.

143
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,980
So, then I was, like...

144
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,760
Okay...

145
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,200
Um...

146
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:21,840
I'm...

147
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,400
I basically...

148
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,960
What I leaked was the video I sent.

149
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,120
The...

150
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,280
It has to be transformed.

151
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,500
It was, like...

152
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,980
The video I sent...

153
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,860
Um...

154
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,220
Uh...

155
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,500
I sent in the members.

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,040
So, like...

157
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,920
I let the members hear what I said.

158
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,660
And then...

159
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,640
And so, like...

160
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
I made a video.

161
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,780
I had to make it unlisted.

162
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,420
And then I made a video being, like...

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,220
Hi...

164
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,660
Um...

165
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,440
This is me.

166
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,640
This is my channel.

167
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,200
Here's my main channel.

168
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,700
And here's my Twitch channel.

169
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,700
So, like...

170
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,880
You can tell this is me.

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,140
And then, like...

172
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,260
I sent that in.

173
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,100
I was, like...

174
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,680
Here's all the...

175
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,060
Like...

176
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,680
I is me.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,080
I'm Doki Bird.

178
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,900
This is all me.

179
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,840
And then I sent it in.

180
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,780
And then they rejected it.

181
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,960
And was, like...

182
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,620
We don't...

183
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,240
We're, like...

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,260
We don't know if this is you.

185
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,240
And I was, like...

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,980
What do you mean?

187
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,120
You don't know if it's me.

188
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,140
I literally said, it's me.

189
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,400
Like...

190
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,740
I literally said, it's me.

191
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,280
What do you mean?

192
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,280
It's not me.

193
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,820
And so, like...

194
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,000
They rejected the appeal.

195
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,240
And then...

196
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,400
I had to e-mail my YouTube guy.

197
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,120
And I was, like...

198
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,780
What the fuck is going on?

199
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,620
I was, like...

200
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,240
I was, like...

201
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,580
Why did they reject me?

202
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,280
It's me.

203
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,480
And my YouTube guy, like...

204
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,900
Got...

205
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,140
Like...

206
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,360
Was, like...

207
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,900
Don't worry.

208
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,720
I got this.

209
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,900
I'll make...

210
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll talk to them myself.

211
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,900
I got you.

212
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,920
And so, like...

213
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,940
And the day after...

214
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,520
I remember.

215
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,140
I think, like...

216
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,240
A day after they remonetized it.

217
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,620
They were, like...

218
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,480
You're good to go.

219
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,000
You're in the program now.

220
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,920
They're, like...

221
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,780
They're, like...

222
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,840
You're good to go.

223
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,500
You're in the program now for your second channel.

224
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,460
And I was, like...

225
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:51,740
Yay!

226
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,780
That's all you have to do.

227
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,400
You gotta get a YouTube guy.

228
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,220
E-mail them.

229
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,660
Be, like...

230
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,220
What the fuck?

231
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,820
And then they'll, like...

232
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,200
Don't worry.

233
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,040
Yay!

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm so happy.

235
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,140
I'm so happy.

236
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Oh, my God.

237
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,420
So, second channel...

238
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,120
Monetized.

239
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,820
Anyway.

240
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,640
I have a meeting.

241
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,960
That's the reason why the stream is starting earlier.

242
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
I like how, like...

243
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,280
Already, like...

244
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,620
Talk for 14 minutes now.

245
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,520
But I still have more stuff to talk about.

246
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,040
So, I'm so sorry for the EU goons who are, like...

247
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,920
Doki, please.

248
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,720
We have so limited time together.

249
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,000
This is the only stream we could watch this week.

250
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,880
And everything.

251
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,840
Reasonable time, Doki, please play the game.

252
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,140
I'm sorry, but like I'm gonna keep talking

253
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,020
Doki, my connecting flight, please start the plane!

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:13:19,600
anyway, so that's why I have a I have a meeting at 2 p.m And I debate between like either streaming at 3 or streaming an hour earlier because you know If I stream at my usual time, I can only do like, you know, not that much and I was just like I don't want to rush it I don't want to rush it I don't wanna because it would be like a lesson to our stream and I was like we don't really have a stream for the EU goons This week so I was like,

255
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:49,420
oh my gosh all the other slots were sort of taken So I was like, okay Like I said all the other time slots were taken like all the other slots were taking when I'm like an indie now so I control my own schedule We schedule something because of something here or like overlapping or anything because there's literally no overlaps for me anymore But like anyway as I was saying there was no more time slots for me to put it in So I was like I might as well put this at 11 with this one at 1130

256
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:03,860
Anyway Anyway I got some like oh my gosh I'm like super happy today because I actually woke up to some really good news today.

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,100
I can't say what but like I could say like a lot of my dreams are coming true, and I'm just I'm just really happy.

258
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,280
I'm just so happy!

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,480
I mean I'm just happier.

260
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,300
But it's super exciting it's super duper exciting.

261
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,660
I'm like really excited about the oncoming news.

262
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,480
Anyway, flight simulator.

263
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,820
I've always wanted to try this game out.

264
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,480
I feel like I'm gonna yell that a lot though.

265
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,740
I feel like I'm gonna get yelled at so much because it's so...

266
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,300
I was like looking at the settings and I was like what the fuck?

267
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,320
Because it's like super immersive and I'm just like oh man.

268
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,560
Oh no.

269
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:56,240
This game might be too easy because of how because of how immersive it is and how obviously amazing I am at flying.

270
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,220
I was like oh man.

271
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,800
This is so much fun.

272
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
This game could just be too fucking easy.

273
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,640
Oh no!

274
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,420
Oh my god, anyway.

275
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,380
I don't know.

276
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,500
I feel I'm a bit scared for those who are wondering.

277
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:33,760
I'm still not using my I'm still not using my new PC because it's a lot to set up for and um The new PC there's a lot of stuff I need to do to set up for it And I really I haven't had the time to actually like sit down and Sit down and like, you know transfer everything over.

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,200
I feel like I think I will like do that at another time Maybe like when I have maybe like more rest days at the moment.

279
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:57,240
So I guess we're gonna stress test my my current PC which we don't really need a stress test because we can like you know, we can we can sort of understand how stressed the PC already is.

280
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,760
So...

281
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,760
I feel like I have to change these settings.

282
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,580
I don't know These settings seem pretty..

283
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:15,040
you know... I don't know I'm worried I'm so worried Okay Do we really?

284
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,860
I don't know man, okay We're gonna try those settings that we're gonna do a Default what what's the words that could happen?

285
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,080
Default Thanks Superchat did you can thank you if you could do a forklift And a plane would be easy to give a superstar Thank you.

286
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,020
Also, I saw that you guys... good eye.

287
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,440
I don't know if you guys know this, but it's one of my four birthdays.

288
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,780
Or is it five birthdays?

289
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,660
I already lost track of my own lore.

290
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,940
Thank you.

291
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,620
Yes, it's one of my four of the five birthdays.

292
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,260
Very good eye.

293
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,540
Thank you.

294
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,660
It's my birthday, guys.

295
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,340
Real.

296
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,360
Alright, how do you play this?

297
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:58,980
What do we do?

298
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,780
Do we do flight training?

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,340
I guess we should do flight training, right?

300
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,720
Or do we go straight into it?

301
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,440
I feel like I already have enough flight training, guys.

302
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:08,980
Right?

303
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,340
Right?

304
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,300
What mode should we do?

305
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,100
World map?

306
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,960
Do we do world... I feel like world map is gonna fucking kill my PC.

307
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,780
Okay, but what if we do like a discovery flight?

308
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,660
And what if we go to New York City?

309
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,580
Okay, we shouldn't go to New York City.

310
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,280
I just realized the implications.

311
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,480
What if we do like... I don't know.

312
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,840
The island here.

313
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,820
The Bora Bora.

314
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,600
Alright.

315
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,280
We'll do Bora Bora and then...

316
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,880
I don't know.

317
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,900
The Skyhawk?

318
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,800
Bro, what the fuck?

319
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,080
What the fuck is a Skyhawk?

320
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,540
Okay.

321
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,980
I wanna... I wanna do a real plane.

322
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,640
Is that a real plane?

323
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,060
That's a real plane.

324
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,680
Alright, here we go.

325
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,900
The real plane time.

326
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,680
Why the fuck is it showing me a controller?

327
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,860
This is all M and K.

328
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,600

Alright, here we go.

338
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,000
What is this?

339
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140
What is it?

340
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm gonna teach you guys how to be a real pilot.

341
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,540
Also, is Sound Guy even here?

342
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,700
What plane is this?

343
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,260
Um...

344
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,000
Does it tell me what plane it is?

345
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,600
The... Air 3501.

346
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,180
Wait, that's not... I wanna be in the cockpit.

347
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,800
Oh ho.

348
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,780
Guys...

349
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,620
Am I flying?

350
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,480
Oh my god, look.

351
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,520
I'm already doing it already.

352
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,380
Uh...

353
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Guys...

354
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,420
I think I'm... My altitude is slowly going down.

355
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
How do I... How do I pull up?

356
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,840
I thought I would be given more instructions.

357
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,160
How do I pull up?

358
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,820
Why am I looking down here?

359
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,060
Okay.

360
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,040
Guys, we're gonna watch the slowest fucking crash.

361
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,520
Why is it turning?

362
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,220
How do I...

363
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,860
AHHHHH THIS IS WORSE!

364
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,260
THIS IS WORSE!

365
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,280
Okay, I'm...

366
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,680
AHHHHH!

367
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,300
Alright, we're not going... we're not doing that anymore.

368
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,820
Oh my god, I don't know how to change my face.

369
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,340
I accidentally pressed it.

370
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,980
I don't know how to re-change my face.

371
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,940
I don't remember my face.

372
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,500
I don't remember how to use my face, guys.

373
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:09,120
I don't remember how to use my face.

374
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,680
Give me a sec, everybody.

375
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,780
Give me a sec.

376
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,400
Alright, turning that off.

377
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,860
Turning my face off real quick, guys.

378
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,000
Gotta turn that off.

379
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,700
Alright, there we go.

380
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,800
Alright, okay.

381
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,320
I realized... guys, I realized...

382
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,240
We're gonna need to do the tutorial.

383
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,500
We need to do basic handling.

384
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,680
Alright.

385
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
Don't worry.

386
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,900
Don't worry.

387
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,300
Your pilot's got this.

388
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,560
Introduction... we're gonna... we're gonna go through a basic course through this.

389
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,920
It can't be that difficult.

390
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,600
Alright, we can't... it can't be that difficult.

391
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:50,820
Alright.

392
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,680
Alright.

393
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,120
Alright, here we go.

394
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,520
This is it.

395
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,240
Maybe just a little bit of tutorial would be helpful.

396
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,340
I don't know why, but like, maybe just a little bit of a tutorial.

397
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,420
Bacon, thank you for the acca-soupa!

398
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,180
Thank you, thank you!

399
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,940
10 out of 10.

400
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,360
Fastest flight I ever had.

401
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,800
Was a little concerned when a pilot asked how to fly, but they landed on a really nice coffee fountain.

402
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,020
So it's all good.

403
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,360
Yeah!

404
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,240
See?!

405
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,740
That guy gets it!

406
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,880
There was no fire!

407
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,180
There was no fire, so everything was okay.

408
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,920
Hello.

409
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,700
Hello, Jess.

410
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,260
Why are we starting on the ground?

411
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,860
It's a plane.

412
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,960
It should be in the sky.

413
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,300
Okay.

414
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,530
Alright.

415
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,030
I mean, it looks pretty nice.

416
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,410
The ASXGS.

417
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,170
Look at that!

418
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,130
Oh my god, that's me!

419
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,130
There's another person in my plane!

420
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,190
It's my twin!

421
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,010
They trust me so much they put another... Look!

422
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,350
I'm not a bad pilot!

423
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,870
If I was a bad pilot, why would they put another person in my plane?

424
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,550
Okay, open the basic controls pad...

425
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,090
Oh!

426
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,710
Not controller!

427
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,770
Give me a second.

428
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,130
Let me grab my controller.

429
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,850
Apparently, this is on.

430
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,590
I'm on it!

431
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,250
What?

432
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,130
Okay, guys.

433
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,870
Alright, I'm plugging in my controller.

434
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,570
Because apparently I have to use a controller.

435
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,210
I was like, what do you mean?

436
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,950
I can't even change the layout!

437
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,570
Alright.

438
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,170
We have to... Okay, and apply... Okay, yes.

439
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,590
Keep default.

440
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,250
Alright, we're good to go.

441
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,110
This can't be that bad now.

442
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,030
What the fuck is a rudder?

443
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,570
Toggle, increase throttle... Oh, brakes!

444
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,470
We need to know that.

445
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,410
Increase flaps.

446
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,970
Oh my god.

447
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,350
Guys, I think being a pilot is very... I don't know, guys.

448
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,050
I think it's trying to tell me that being a pilot might be a little difficult.

449
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,010
When you're on the plane and you hear your pilot say, guys, how do I fly over the intercom?

450
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,770
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

451
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,250
Thank you.

452
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,850
Thank you.

453
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,270
Alright, how do I get out of here?

454
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:25,650
Okay.

455
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,770
I got it.

456
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,570
I opened the cam... Opened the camera panel.

457
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,570
Oh my god, I'm dual wielding.

458
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:32,570
Camera.

459
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,430
I wanna be... Oh, it says track IP.

460
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,290
I was like, what?

461
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,070
Okay, I wanna be in the cockpit.

462
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,090
Can I change what my pilot looks like?

463
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,030
Was it pilot?

464
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,150
Landing?

465
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,950
Co-pilot?

466
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,330
No, I wanna be my pilot.

467
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:51,850
Okay.

468
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,770
Now I'm super immersive.

469
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,490
Yeah.

470
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,290
I can turn on the cabin light.

471
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,430
How do I... Point the yoke and hide it?

472
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,170
What the fuck is a yoke?

473
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,070
Oh, is this a yoke?

474
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,410
Oh, okay.

475
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,710
Wait, I can turn on... Oh my god, I can turn on strobe lights?

476
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,830
Oh my god, there's so many things.

477
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,430
How do I... How do I turn this off?

478
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,130
.

479
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:26,170
.

480
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,830
Okay, that's cool.

481
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,970
Oh, that's why we have a co-pilot.

482
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,990
So like, if I fuck up, they can like, take the wheel.

483
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,470
Okay.

484
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,810
I'm trying to...

485
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,510
Guys, I'm trying.

486
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,450
Trying so hard.

487
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,550
Guys, okay.

488
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,030
Taxi lights.

489
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,810
Okay.

490
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,950
Okay.

491
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,510
Um...

492
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,170
Um...

493
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,570
Oh, the cursor point thing... Where the...

494
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,230
What?

495
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,010
Okay, guys.

496
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,630
Where's...

497
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,610
Guys, where's the yoke?

498
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,290
Where's the yoke?

499
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,530
Okay, but like, oh my god, I can turn on these lights though.

500
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,230
There it is.

501
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,670
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

502
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,510
I can have all the lights on.

503
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,450
I am pressing A.

504
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,710
I'm pressing A!

505
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,290
Are we leaving?

506
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,070
Sir, please be patient!

507
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:36,970
Oh, yoke!

508
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,470
Yo- It's this button!

509
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,370
It's right here!

510
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,130
Wait, what?

511
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,990
Wait, I saw the yoke!

512
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,910
Where was the yoke?

513
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,890
I... Oh, wait.

514
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,870
I saw it again!

515
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,570
There it is.

516
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,470
Oh my god, that's the yoke.

517
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,250
That's the yoke.

518
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,790
Yoke!

519
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,390
Oh my god.

520
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,250
Oh my god, it's...

521
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,510
Wait, but it... Okay, lock the cursor.

522
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,350
Lock the knob by pressing A.

523
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,730
Okay, did I lock it?

524
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,210
Did I lock it?

525
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,450
Did I lock it?

526
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,510
Um...

527
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,390
Am I locking?

528
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,870
Instructor?

529
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,310
Am I... Instructor, please.

530
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,030
I'm pressing... Instructor, please.

531
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,070
I'm trying.

532
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,030
Where?

533
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,230
Wait, I should, like, hide this one too.

534
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,150
Instructor, it's not letting me lock!

535
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,470
Teacher!

536
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,610
It's not...

537
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,430
I'm trying!

538
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,090
Oh!

539
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,310
It's, like, right here!

540
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,350
You have to click exactly this tiny-ass thing!

541
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,550
Okay, that seems like the right time.

542
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,610
See?

543
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,690
Oh, I need to know my time.

544
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,050
As a pilot, you don't need to know what time it is.

545
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,430
If they're late, they're late.

546
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,230
We can...

547
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,330
They'll never blame the pilot for being late.

548
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,130
They'll blame the airlines.

549
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,010
Um, Aura, thank you for the super chat!

550
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,870
Thank you, thank you!

551
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,930
My flightless blur!

552
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,190
Thank you for the super chat!

553
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,930
Okay, hold LB and move the camera around.

554
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,410
I'm holding.

555
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,870
Okay.

556
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,190
Oh, that was not LB, sorry.

557
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,350
Alright, I'm using... Oh.

558
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,570
What?

559
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,450
Oh!

560
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:43,850
Okay.

561
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,070
Okay, I think I like...

562
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,270
Alright, save a custom view.

563
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,930
There you go.

564
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,750
Alright.

565
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,650
We're so... We're so... We're so locked in.

566
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,190
Guys, we're really locked in now.

567
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,330
Okay, I'm gonna go make sure we're... We're high... We're lower.

568
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,290
Alright.

569
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,190
Alright.

570
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,290
So I can just see the controls.

571
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,610
I like that.

572
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,250
Yeah.

573
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,010
This one... I like this height.

574
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,410
Press LB and save using... Yeah.

575
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,490
It's not saved?

576
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,350
Save.

577
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,310
Save.

578
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,530
Save?

579
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,350
Okay,

580
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,330
I don't think... Okay, I don't think they let me have that as a custom.

581
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:25,710
Okay.

582
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,450
Save.

583
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,550
Save?

584
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,850
Save.

585
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,030
Oh, there we go.

586
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,370
Save.

587
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,110
Alright.

588
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,530
Okay, nice.

589
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,790
And then LB, Y...

590
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,810
Oh, okay.

591
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,670
Okay.

592
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,650
I want this to be my custom though.

593
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,810
Try to familiarize yourself with them a bit more.

594
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,670
There you go.

595
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,710
This is the perfect.

596
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,950
Then reset the camera to its original position whenever you're done.

597
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,570
Okay.

598
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,490
Reset.

599
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,150
Alright, done.

600
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,350
Great.

601
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,350
I did it!

602
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,150
That's it?

603
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,870
That was...

604
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:03,910
Okay.

605
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,490
Guys!

606
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,370
Guys!

607
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,590
I got an A!

608
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,690
I'm ready to fly!

609
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,990
I think I'm ready to fly.

610
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,010
Honestly.

611
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,790
Honestly, after all that...

612
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,990
Yes.

613
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,530
I think I'm ready.

614
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,910
I think I'm ready.

615
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,870
I figured it out.

616
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,590
Guys.

617
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,550
I fucking figured it out.

618
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,310
Alright.

619
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,390
We're gonna...

620
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,750
Let's go to...

621
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,570
Alright, let's see.

622
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,510
Let's go to...

623
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,910
Let's go to...

624
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,910
Seattle.

625
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,550
I wanna go see the...

626
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,970
I wanna see the fucking space needle.

627
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,170
Alright, fly.

628
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,290
And then...

629
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:40,530
Wait.

630
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:40,690
Wait.

631
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,570
Arrival...

632
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,350
And then we depart...

633
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,170
From...

634
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,930
I don't know where this is.

635
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,810
What state is that?

636
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,850
I don't know.

637
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,670
There we go.

638
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,090
Fly!

639
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,510
We're so ready.

640
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,170
We're so fucking ready now.

641
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,890
I got an A!

642
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,970
My instructor said I got an A!

643
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,690
Chat.

644
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,110
How...

645
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,770
How badly can I fuck up now?

646
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,290
I can't fuck up if the instructor gave me an A.

647
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,650
Alright.

648
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,050
Okay.

649
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,070
Oh, thank god.

650
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,690
It's just me.

651
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,070
Okay.

652
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,390
Guys, it's okay.

653
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,190
It's just me.

654
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,010
Alright.

655
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,650
Release the parking brake.

656
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,290
Apply throw throttle.

657
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:20,710
Okay.

658
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,450
Watch this, guys.

659
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:21,890
Okay.

660
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,470
We're gonna...

661
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,450
I like to have...

662
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,050
I'm gonna turn off the visibility here.

663
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,710
And then we're gonna turn on all the lights.

664
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:29,770
Boop.

665
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,430
Boop.

666
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:30,950
Boop.

667
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,250
Boop.

668
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:32,970
Boop.

669
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,710
Boop.

670
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,550
Okay.

671
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,250
And then we gotta have...

672
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,590
We gotta have the cabin light on and everything.

673
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,910
And then...

674
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,490
What the fuck is an alternator?

675
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,990
That's a gun.

676
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,310
And then we're gonna do...

677
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,170
I think we're good.

678
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,750
I think...

679
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,350
I think we're good.

680
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,530
I think we're good to go.

681
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,030
Alright.

682
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,550
Throw full throttle time.

683
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:53,830
Alright.

684
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,410
Woo.

685
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,550
Am I...

686
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,790
How do I go forward?

687
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,270
That should be full throttle.

688
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,570
Oh!

689
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:03,970
Oh!

690
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,830
I'm going forward!

691
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,290
Alright.

692
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,090
Alright.

693
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,870
Looks good.

694
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,030
Looks good.

695
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,410
Looks good.

696
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:11,930
Looks good.

697
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,300
I think we're good.

698
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,080
And then we go up.

699
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,420
Okay.

700
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,620
Am I going straight?

701
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,680
Seems alright.

702
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,960
I'll eventually fly up.

703
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,900
Because of the velocity.

704
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,960
Right?

705
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,220
Raise it higher and lift up.

706
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,720
Oh!

707
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,500
I'm flying!

708
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,420
Oh my god!

709
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,060
Oh!

710
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,660
I'm flying!

711
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,170
Oh!

712
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:48,490
I'm flying!

713
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:48,910
Guys!

714
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,270
Did you see that!

715
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,070
I was in the air!

716
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,200
Guys!

717
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,280
Did you see that!

718
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,140
I flew!

719
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,660
Oh my...

720
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,500
Oh my god!

721
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,220
I flew!

722
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm a natural.

723
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,620
I knew I could do it.

724
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,080
Okay guys.

725
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,300
I think I need another lesson.

726
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,420
I need...

727
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,300
Okay.

728
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,020
I think...

729
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,900
Alright guys.

730
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,920
I think I need another lesson here.

731
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,440
I learned about yoke and reading basic... I don't need to read basic instructions.

732
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,380
Okay, maybe I do.

733
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,400
Alright, here we go.

734
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,700
Oh, what a hell of a way to die.

735
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,000
You're not dead!

736
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,440
Nothing exploded!

737
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,760
It was just a minor inconvenience.

738
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,860
It was just minor inconvenience, chat.

739
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,900
Nobody... everybody's okay.

740
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,360
So dramatic.

741
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:52,940
Okay.

742
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,740
We're learning.

743
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,140
Slowly but surely.

744
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,920
You should give me like a bigger aircraft.

745
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,140
I wanna drive this tiny-ass plane.

746
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,940
Alright.

747
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,880
Thank you, instructor.

748
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,020
Yeah.

749
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,320
Yeah.

750
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,300
I'm getting on board for these flights.

751
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,300
Breezy, thank you for the super chat.

752
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,760
Thank you.

753
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,460
I flew!

754
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,240
Okay.

755
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,880
I'm doing the yoke to see the effect on the ailerons.

756
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,180
Oh my god, do you see that?

757
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,120
The ailerons?

758
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,420
Okay.

759
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,060
Do you see that?

760
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,280
It's moving up and down!

761
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,360
I'm doing that!

762
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,380
The difference between the yoke and a steering wheel is you can pull or push on the yoke.

763
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,780
This controls the elevator at the back of the aircraft to make it climb or descend.

764
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,120
This guy trusts me.

765
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,300
Look at him.

766
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,980
Look at the horizontal stabilizer.

767
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,200
They're like my bodyguards.

768
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,260
You can see how it affects the elevator.

769
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,540
The what?

770
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,640
The elevator?

771
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,640
Is that called an elevator?

772
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,220
Truly a former Air Command Airport hero.

773
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,220
Thank you for the super chat.

774
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,620
Thank you.

775
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,400
You're on the ground.

776
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,240
The upper part of the pedals also control your brakes.

777
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,360
Oh my god.

778
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,040
Wait, I have brakes?

779
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,240
They control the rudder at the end of the rudder.

780
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,760
Whoa, that's new.

781
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:15,230
This is for coordinating turns or compensating for a plane's tendency to pull left during takeoffs and climbs.

782
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,110
Wait.

783
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,990
Sorry, what did she say about the rudder?

784
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,770
Is there a reason for brakes?

785
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,700
Look at the vertical tail and then move by using...

786
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,120
And...

787
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,780
By using...

788
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

789
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,100
Move by RT and...

790
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,040
Oh, look at that!

791
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,660
It's flapping!

792
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,540
Oh my god, it's saying hi!

793
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,440
Oh!

794
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,840
That's how you turn, right?

795
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,100
Pulling back will decrease power.

796
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

797
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,200
Look at the throttle.

798
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,040
Is that the throttle?

799
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,140
This is where I drive!

800
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,220
Keep it selected and push it forward to increase power.

801
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,720
Oh, did I not increase power?

802
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,440
Guys, I think I realized why I crashed.

803
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,080
Guys.

804
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,380
Guys, I think I realized.

805
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,860
Also, thank you flight attendant for telling me to...

806
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,140
For telling me to...

807
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,180
To increase the sound.

808
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,180
And not push it enough?

809
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,400
How much more do you want me to push it?

810
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,820
There you go.

811
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,480
Power is increased.

812
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,060
Now, pull it back to decrease power.

813
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,680
Okay.

814
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,580
Oh!

815
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,300
Oh my god, there's so many things to know.

816
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,760
Where the fuck is my co-pilot?

817
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,040
Deselect the throttle and

818
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,350
increase power.

819
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,530
Look away?

820
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,050
Why do I...

821
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:49,790
Oh!

822
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,170
I can just hold!

823
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:51,510
Oh!

824
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,730
I can just hold it!

825
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,930
Hold B to decrease.

826
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:58,850
Oh!

827
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,270
I'm doing it.

828
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,290
RPM indicator?

829
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,530
What the fuck is...

830
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:09,650
Oh!

831
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,670
But that's my co-pilot spot!

832
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,790
Who's gonna tell me about my RPM meter?

833
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,770
The engine is spinning in hundreds of revolutions per minute.

834
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,630
That's so far away from me!

835
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,490
Look at your current speed on the airspeed indicator.

836
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,450
Where's that?

837
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,050
It's on the left in the main instrument panel.

838
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,330
Oh, okay.

839
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,330
Thank you.

840
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,170
Thank you instructor.

841
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,610
It measures the speed in knots.

842
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,090
I don't even know that.

843
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,850
As long as I go fast, that's all that matters, right?

844
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,930
It's on the right side of the main instrument panel.

845
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,630
Okay.

846
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,030
Alright, dragoons.

847
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,830
You're my co-pilot.

848
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,590
Guys, you gotta make sure we don't crash.

849
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,030
Because if we crash, we both die.

850
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,170
You'd be like, oh, it's so funny.

851
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:52,790
Don't crash.

852
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,430
You're in the same plane.

853
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,450
We both crash.

854
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,030
Like, it's your fault as well.

855
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,570
That's all for today.

856
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,130
That's it?

857
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,330
Next time, we'll see how it feels in the air.

858
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:05,650
What?

859
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,550
That's it?

860
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,670
You just... what?

861
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,150
Guys!

862
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,090
Oh my god.

863
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,290
I think I'm ready for real this time.

864
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,210
Guys!

865
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,150
Guys, I think we're ready for real.

866
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,170
Okay, let's like go in the air first.

867
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,150
Okay, I'm gonna... we're gonna try to go in the air.

868
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,210
And then after being in the air, we're definitely ready.

869
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,670
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

870
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,550
Thank you, thank you.

871
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,090
I will go out in the blaze for the content.

872
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,810
Thank you for the super chat.

873
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,950
Thank you, thank you.

874
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,750
Okay.

875
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,750
I'm in the air!

876
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,750
I did?

877
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,570
Oh my god, I'm in the air.

878
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:58,790
Okay.

879
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,530
Oh my god, it's beautiful.

880
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,690
Thank you for the super chat.

881
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,390
Thank you, thank you.

882
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:11,450
As someone who works in aviation maintenance, thank you for keeping me employed.

883
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,010
Thank you for the super chat.

884
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,990
Thank you, thank you.

885
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,630
Thank you for the super chat.

886
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,630
Thank you, thank you.

887
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,410
Oh, it is!

888
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,070
Look at that!

889
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,690
It's so beautiful!

890
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,070
I love how... unrendered this is.

891
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,090
There's an airport?

892
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:30,690
Where?

893
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,030
Is that an airport?

894
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,630
What the fuck is that?

895
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,210
That's an airport?

896
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,830
Oh, the instructor flies?

897
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,430
What if I don't want you to fly it?

898
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,360
When it was my turn?

899
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,420
That's not fair!

900
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm the pilot!

901
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,620
I'm wearing the hat!

902
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,360
That's not fair!

903
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,240
It's like she doesn't trust me!

904
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,720
It's like my fucking co-pilot doesn't trust me!

905
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,340
They don't even let me fly the thing!

906
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,620
I'm gonna turn on the fucking lights.

907
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,380
Oh, I can't.

908
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,720
They just...

909
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,080
They won't even let me turn on the lights!

910
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,080
Why do they disable everything?

911
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,340
Okay.

912
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,160
I wouldn't either.

913
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,680
Oh!

914
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,540
Okay.

915
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,000
Monkey see, monkey do.

916
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,740
Wait, but her thing is not moving!

917
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,240
Oh my god!

918
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,220
Autopilot is on, isn't it?

919
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,560
You can't fool me!

920
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,200
The yoke isn't even moving!

921
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,230
How do I know if it's under 30 degrees?

922
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,690
Which one do I look at for that?

923
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,150
There's just so many... Which one do I look at?

924
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,710
How do I know if it's... Do I have to be outside?

925
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,690
Go ahead and try rolling to the right.

926
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,810
Okay.

927
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,670
How do I know if it's 30 degrees?

928
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,330
I have controls!

929
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,130
Oh my god!

930
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,210
I'm gonna turn on some lights.

931
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,510
Oh, I wanna turn on the pilot heat.

932
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,250
My cushy is cold.

933
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,710
I'm gonna turn on the pilot heat.

934
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,150
And then I'm gonna turn on...

935
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,450
I'm gonna turn on the landing lights.

936
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,270
Because I might be landing soon.

937
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,270
And then the taxi lights.

938
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:42,610
Alright.

939
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,830
We...

940
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:44,650
Oh!

941
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,310
Oh!

942
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,250
We're okay.

943
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,610
See?

944
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:55,870
We're okay!

945
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,570
Look at that!

946
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,590
We're going to Sedona!

947
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,290
That's like a song, right?

948
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,270
Control movements are soft and gentle.

949
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,170
They were not okay.

950
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,330
As we flank toward Sedona, let's try climbing up and down.

951
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,290
Up and down.

952
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:12,390
Whoa!

953
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:13,910
That's it.

954
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,530
Pull on the yoke to climb!

955
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,790
Give it a try.

956
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,190
Yay.

957
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,130
That's climbing, right?

958
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,270
Hold your pitch up for five seconds.

959
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,350
What does that mean?

960
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,130
Excellent.

961
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,330
Oh, okay.

962
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,150
For the descent.

963
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,850
Is the same principle?

964
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,190
Except pushing on the yoke.

965
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,750
Those beeps are not of those beeps you just all scare...

966
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,270
Alright.

967
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,110
Gently push forward.

968
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,410
Forward.

969
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,650
Hold your pitch down for five seconds.

970
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,270
Okay.

971
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,030
I'm so gentle!

972
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,110
Do you guys not see that?

973
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,830
Oh, it's this way.

974
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,210
Guys!

975
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,210
Guys!

976
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,290
I thought it'd be funny!

977
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,410
I thought it'd be funny!

978
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,910
Guys!

979
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:12,900
Guys!

980
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,340
Okay, I got a little impatient.

981
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,840
I thought my co-pilot... Guys, I thought my co-pilot would stop me.

982
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,600
I really thought... I really... I really thought... I really thought my co-pilot would stop me!

983
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,440
Thank you for the super chat!

984
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,800
Thank you!

985
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,280
Thank you!

986
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,800
I had to look at the fucking scenery again!

987
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,400
I thought they would stop me!

988
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,640
What's the point of having a co-pilot if they don't stop you from making stupid decisions?

989
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,820
Your co-pilot is here to stop your intrusive thoughts.

990
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,300
I just think my co-pilot was not doing her job.

991
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,400
They could've fucking... They could've fucking took control of the yoke!

992
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,260
That's not my fault!

993
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,900
They could've literally took control... It's their life too!

994
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,180
It's their life too!

995
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,960
Oh my god, I can turn on the crew volume?

996
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,100
Okay, enjoy the view.

997
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,800
Alright, I'm enjoying the view, guys.

998
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,000
Look at that.

999
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,340
Look at that beautiful airport over there.

1000
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,680
It's not my fault my intrusive thoughts won.

1001
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,920
What's the point of having a co-pilot if they don't stop you from making terrible decisions?

1002
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,080
Like, I might as well be the only person in this plane.

1003
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,200
You have 5.2 gig co-pilots and no one... Why did you guys not stop me, huh?

1004
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,880
You guys were supposed to be my co-pilots!

1005
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,380
Why didn't you guys stop me?

1006
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,800
From letting my thoughts win!

1007
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,640
Alright.

1008
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,000
I still can't read all of these.

1009
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,340
There's too many fucking...

1010
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,280
meter circle things in front of me.

1011
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,260
What's this?

1012
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,060
Is this the time?

1013
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,840
Oh, so that's how you do the turn.

1014
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,440
That's such a smooth turn, man.

1015
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,600
Why can't I fly like that?

1016
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,640
I can and I will.

1017
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,640
I'm gonna prove you all wrong.

1018
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,600
JK because I can.

1019
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,480
Okay.

1020
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,180
How do I know it's 30 degrees?

1021
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,240
I'm not good at math.

1022
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,760
Can I have access to the plane now?

1023
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,760
Okay.

1024
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,300
I wanna...

1025
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,360
Alright.

1026
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,840
Okay.

1027
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,840
I'm gonna turn on my... the light.

1028
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,040
I'm gonna turn on the heat position.

1029
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,060
And then the light.

1030
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,120
Here.

1031
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,520
What's this red button?

1032
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,520
Oooh.

1033
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,460
Long time flight simmer.

1034
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,720
Very recent dragoon here.

1035
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,500
This is fantastic.

1036
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,200
Keep up...

1037
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:14,380
See?

1038
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,860
This person thinks I'm fucking flying the plane perfectly.

1039
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,640
August, thank you for the super chat.

1040
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,940
Thank you.

1041
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,740
I knew I was doing things right.

1042
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,820
If this long-term flight simulator player thinks I'm doing okay, then I'm right and you're wrong.

1043
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,860
Fake donating.

1044
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,560
Don't enable it.

1045
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,500
Gently pull back the yolk to increase the...

1046
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,380
Is that gentle?

1047
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,120
Next time, be a bit more gentle on the controls.

1048
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,720
What do you mean that's so gentle?

1049
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,060
For the descent, it's the same principle except you're pushing on the yolk.

1050
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,780
Go ahead.

1051
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,200
Gently pitch down.

1052
00:45:59,500 --> 00:45:59,960
Okay.

1053
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,160
I think I'm doing it.

1054
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,640
Okay.

1055
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,040
There.

1056
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,420
Guys.

1057
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,460
We're experiencing some turbulence right now.

1058
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,480
This is just turbulence.

1059
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,560
Is this what turbulence is?

1060
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,240
Look around.

1061
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,040
And when you found it, make a turn in that direction.

1062
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,740
Oh, wait.

1063
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,180
It's this way.

1064
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,600
Weeeeee.

1065
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,400
Okay.

1066
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,780
We gotta go up though when we're turning.

1067
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:22,940
Weeeeee.

1068
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,740
This is what turbulence, guys.

1069
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,300
We're just experiencing turbulence.

1070
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,220
It's not...

1071
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,720
It's not man-made error.

1072
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,760
It's just turbulence.

1073
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,100
Okay.

1074
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,860
Captain Doki, we're losing altitude.

1075
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,180
Reduce speed to 138 knots and pull up on the yolk.

1076
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,580
Oh, Charlie, thank you for the super chat.

1077
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,040
Thank you.

1078
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,420
Thank you.

1079
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:45,920
Where the...

1080
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,040
Where the fuck's the airport?

1081
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,240
Find and turn towards the airport.

1082
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,700
Where the fuck is it?

1083
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,920
There's just all houses.

1084
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,840
Where the fuck build all these houses next to my airport?

1085
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,460
Where the fuck is the airport?

1086
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,760
Oh my god.

1087
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,660
I'm still flying.

1088
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,140
I can't see the goddamn airport.

1089
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,100
Is that the airport?

1090
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,480
Is that the runway?

1091
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,460
That's the runway, right?

1092
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,260
Guys, where the fuck is the airport?

1093
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,760
Is it behind me?

1094
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,460
No, that's the airport, right?

1095
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,000
Just landing on the port.

1096
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,680
No, that's a road?

1097
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,560
Oh my god.

1098
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,760
Okay.

1099
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,320
We're gonna find this goddamn airport.

1100
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,260
Turn your head.

1101
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,040
Oh!

1102
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,660
Oh my god, guys.

1103
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,140
I could turn my head.

1104
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,340
Okay.

1105
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,660
No, that's not the airport.

1106
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,380
Oh, there it is!

1107
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,900
There it is!

1108
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,660
I see the airport!

1109
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,660
There it is!

1110
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,480
It was right behind me this entire time!

1111
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,320
There you go.

1112
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,880
I was like, turn please for the love of god.

1113
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,440
Turn your head.

1114
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,320
You're flying.

1115
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,800
This is like a drug world.

1116
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,500
We're too fired up pilot.

1117
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,820
Look, I didn't say how I got my license.

1118
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,840
Thank you, super chat.

1119
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,380
Thank you.

1120
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,020
Thank you.

1121
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,700
There you go.

1122
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,380
I found it.

1123
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,900
Guys, I found the airport.

1124
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:12,860
Can

1125
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,020
I do it?

1126
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,700
Oh my god.

1127
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,880
I'm a certified pilot.

1128
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,320
Look at that!

1129
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,040
A bee!

1130
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,260
Why would I deserve a bee?

1131
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,240
That was just turbulence.

1132
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,820
Thank you, super chat.

1133
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,100
Thank you.

1134
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:38,640
Thank you.

1135
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,820
Oh my god.

1136
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,440
How come turbulence affected my...

1137
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,380
my grade?

1138
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,760
That's not fair!

1139
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,120
Alright.

1140
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,840
Altitude refers to the aircraft's nose position relative to the horizon.

1141
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,980
There's three pitch altitudes controlled by the elevator.

1142
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,580
And in this lesson, you will learn to climb, cruise, and descend.

1143
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,720
I don't need to learn how to do that.

1144
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,220
I just go up and down.

1145
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,480
The bee for Toekeeper.

1146
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,600
Bee for best pilot.

1147
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,140
Exactly.

1148
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,420
That's why I got a bee.

1149
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,140
You're telling how good I was at flying this plane.

1150
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,540
It was so majestic.

1151
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,980
Okay.

1152
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,820
I don't feel comfortable when my pilot has these three lines on the plane.

1153
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,240
Before you get on the plane, make sure your plane doesn't have these three lines drawn on there.

1154
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,900
Because that means it might be driven by Toekeeper.

1155
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:34,880
Hahaha.

1156
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,660
Let's dig deeper into what that means.

1157
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,200
Pull back gently on the yoke until the climb horizon.

1158
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,980
Then maintain that attitude.

1159
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,100
Oh!

1160
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,000
I see.

1161
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,200
According to your altimeter, we're gaining altitude.

1162
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,620
Oh, that's my altitunary.

1163
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,320
Proving you can't avoid basic physics while making a climb.

1164
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,860
Wait, I need no physics?

1165
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,820
I need no math to be a pilot?

1166
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:05,780
Excellent.

1167
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:12,910
Okay.

1168
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,210
Our speed is increasing and our altitude is stable.

1169
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:17,690
Alright.

1170
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,830
That's why you don't migrate like other birds.

1171
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,670
Because I like to stay inside.

1172
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,370
The altitude line matches the horizon.

1173
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,210
Then maintain that attitude.

1174
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:32,810
The attitude?

1175
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:33,370
Okay.

1176
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,350
I thought it was altitude.

1177
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,770
On to the horizon for ten seconds.

1178
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,190
Okay.

1179
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,430
Our altitude is decreasing while our speed is picking up.

1180
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:42,690
Oh my god.

1181
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,650
I have to look at all these fucking circles.

1182
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,350
That's too many circles to look at.

1183
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,750
I have to look.

1184
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,770
I wanna enjoy the scenery.

1185
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,550
We're gonna cruise altitude-ly.

1186
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,010
Your speed is decreasing and your altitude is stable.

1187
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,350
That's okay.

1188
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:05,130
Try to make only small adjustments to your pitch to avoid overcorrection.

1189
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,390
Am I doing it?

1190
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:09,870
I did it.

1191
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,050
Those are small.

1192
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:16,970
Alright.

1193
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,270
Alright.

1194
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:22,390
Would you be comfortable if your pilot was like a B student?

1195
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:23,990
I don't know, man.

1196
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,970
I mean, it's B for best, right?

1197
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,150
That's how the markings go.

1198
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,610
A is alright.

1199
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,650
B for best.

1200
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,090
C for completionist.

1201
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,670
D for done job.

1202
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:37,970
Good.

1203
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,310
Alright.

1204
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:39,610
Turns.

1205
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,250
Oh my god.

1206
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,310
I can do barrel rolls.

1207
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,870
I'm gonna learn how to do...

1208
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,310
Pal-ta-tay.

1209
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:49,730
See?

1210
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,550
D for Dokie.

1211
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,970
Yeah, D for Dokie.

1212
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:57,650
Weeee!

1213
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,080
I don't know...

1214
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,060
I donno what I expected.

1215
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,540
I don't know.

1216
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,640
I thought I'd be different.

1217
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,080
I...

1218
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,340
hours...

1219
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,020
I really thought this would be different.

1220
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,580
Okay, but what if I do this while pulling up?

1221
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,580
Maybe it'll be better.

1222
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:37,530
Up!

1223
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,970
Up!

1224
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:40,570
Up!

1225
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:40,930
Up!

1226
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:41,630
I did it!

1227
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,270
Oh my g- guys!

1228
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,790
Guys, I did it!

1229
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:50,050
Guys!

1230
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:52,830
Did you guys see that?

1231
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,230
Oh my god!

1232
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,010
With the risk of your lives!

1233
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,350
I did it!

1234
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,170
I pulled it off!

1235
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:05,370
Okay.

1236
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:17,950
I did it.

1237
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,950
I'm a professional already.

1238
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,510
Is this the Doki Doki Bird Flight Airport?

1239
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,730
Sounds horrific!

1240
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,550
Thank you for the super chat, Zlack.

1241
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:26,770
Thank you.

1242
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:31,290
Why are you doing this?

1243
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,490
What the fuck is that?

1244
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:42,990
Okay.

1245
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,410
Air Travel, thank you for the super chat!

1246
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,290
Thank you, thank you!

1247
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:52,530
I've flown a real Cessna 152, except it was an Autobot.

1248
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,990
No, 152 is so easy.

1249
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,930
It's so easy to fly, especially in slow flight and sleep turns.

1250
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:57,970
See, guys?

1251
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,690
This is so easy!

1252
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,330
That's basically what they're saying.

1253
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,570
So thank you for the super chat.

1254
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,150
Thank you, thank you.

1255
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:09,350
What they're saying is I'm doing a great job.

1256
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,210
I'm doing amazing right now.

1257
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,630
That's exactly what the super chat implies.

1258
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:19,850
Right.

1259
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,710
Maintaining it right now?

1260
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:22,430
That's good.

1261
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:22,890
Yay!

1262
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,690
I'm working to maintain a constant...

1263
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:27,910
How do I land my plane?

1264
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:29,830
Level up.

1265
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,180
Wee.

1266
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,140
You put your plane in a dangerous situation.

1267
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,620
Oh.

1268
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,840
Level us back out now.

1269
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,020
Oh, now she takes control!

1270
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:47,580
Okay, not gonna lie, she should have taken control before I did my barrel roll.

1271
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,700
Additional practice will help, don't worry.

1272
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,120
I like how now she fucking takes control of the plane.

1273
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,340
Small corrections on the yoke will lead to more accurate turns.

1274
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:55,760
Am I leveled?

1275
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,600
Accurate turns.

1276
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,080
I think I can.

1277
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,080
I did it!

1278
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:01,500
C!

1279
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,360
Oh, for completionist.

1280
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:04,620
For...

1281
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,000
Uh...

1282
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,520
Completionist guy.

1283
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,980
C for completionist, guys.

1284
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,540
I did a great job, thank you, instructor.

1285
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,940
All right, what's this?

1286
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,080
Power settings, the basics, straight level, altitude, okay, I feel like I don't need a note of basic handling anymore.

1287
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,260
I feel like it's all about taking...

1288
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,240
Takeoff and landing.

1289
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,740
And then after that, I should be fine.

1290
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,020
Oh, airliner trainer.

1291
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,200
Okay, we're gonna go with...

1292
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,600
I don't need to know basic stuff anymore.

1293
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,540
I just need to know how to take off.

1294
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,900
Fire space to the runway, takeoff.

1295
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,080
And then I'll figure out landing later.

1296
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:51,180
I'm gonna do takeoff and then we're gonna figure out landing on the go.

1297
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,640
We're gonna figure out landing live.

1298
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,160
All we need to know is how to take off the plane.

1299
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,120
Alright, Texas, thank you for the super chat.

1300
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,700
Thank you, thank you.

1301
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,000
Wait, I gotta get more immersive for that.

1302
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:03,760
Okay.

1303
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,240
Okay.

1304
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,380
Is it clear?

1305
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,520
Is it clear?

1306
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,940
I don't think there's anybody here.

1307
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,420
I think they know I'm flying a plane today.

1308
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,960
Yeah, I think they know I'm flying today.

1309
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,300
Alright.

1310
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,240
Yeah, seems clear.

1311
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah.

1312
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:20,500
Alright.

1313
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:20,760
Alright.

1314
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,700
Slightly increase the power.

1315
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,620
That should be good.

1316
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,860
And then we're gonna go to the center of the...

1317
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1318
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,020
Guys, guys, it wasn't slight!

1319
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,300
Guys, guys, it wasn't...

1320
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,280
Okay, I'm gonna figure this...

1321
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,580
Because I realized it was not slight.

1322
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,300
It was not slight chat.

1323
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,400
Okay.

1324
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,360
Right there.

1325
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,520
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

1326
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,900
Guys, why is it not turning?!

1327
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,940
Guys!

1328
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,100
The trees!

1329
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,360
The trees!

1330
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,980
Oh, okay, okay.

1331
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,740
There you start.

1332
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,020
Oh, thank God.

1333
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,240
Oh, thank God my co-pilot...

1334
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,040
Oh, my co-pilot took control.

1335
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,480
Oh, thank God.

1336
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh, thank God.

1337
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,120
Oh, my God, my co-pilot exactly took control of my way.

1338
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,320
And she let me know, did I not hear you?

1339
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:39,880
Guys, guys, guys.

1340
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,520
That's what I have to do anyways.

1341
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:40,960
They're suffer under the sort of me.

1342
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,780
Yeah, totally.

1343
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,060
Do you remember what you told me like guys.

1344
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,480
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1345
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,640
You keep trying and you keep trying.

1346
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,160
I do though, I do!

1347
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,400
No, stop!

1348
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,760
Is this center?

1349
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,700
Is this...

1350
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,200
Guys, am I in the center?

1351
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,020
Guys, I don't think I'm in the center.

1352
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,160
Guys...

1353
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:09,900
Brakes...

1354
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,960
How do I...

1355
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,520
How do I get the brakes?

1356
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,300
AHHHHH!

1357
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,740
How do I...

1358
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,340
How do I do the brakes?

1359
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,160
Okay.

1360
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,260
Alright, we're going.

1361
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,580
... with the center line.

1362
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,200
Then stop your plane just after the number 21.

1363
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:33,640
Oh!

1364
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,900
Where's 21?

1365
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,000
Guys!

1366
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,920
I think I passed 21!

1367
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,520
I think I...

1368
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,620
But it's okay, I'm in the center now.

1369
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,840
I'm in the center though!

1370
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:52,740
Guys, I think 21 is like way behind me.

1371
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,900
Not gonna lie.

1372
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,120
Maybe I can turn around.

1373
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,380
Maybe the copilot will take me back to the Let me be...

1374
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,580
Ma'am!

1375
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,300
Ma'am!

1376
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:01,720
Ma'am!

1377
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,660
Take me back!

1378
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,600
Take me... Oh!

1379
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:03,940
Oh!

1380
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,440
Oh!

1381
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,360
Go back in position.

1382
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,100
Oh, thank god.

1383
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,520
Oh, okay, nevermind.

1384
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,380
I collided with the object.

1385
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,100
Okay, this time I got it.

1386
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,020
Oh my god, this was a brake.

1387
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,360
Oh, this is a brake.

1388
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:26,660
Okay.

1389
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,000
Okay.

1390
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,940
What power am I on?

1391
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm on 7%.

1392
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,440
Okay.

1393
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,680
Okay.

1394
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:41,500
Okay.

1395
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,240
Nobody here.

1396
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,980
Guys, I remember how to use the brake.

1397
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,020
Look, look, see?

1398
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,040
Am I ready?

1399
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,560
Guys, I remember.

1400
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,180
Okay.

1401
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,560
Look left.

1402
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,860
I did it.

1403
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,520
Thanks for flying with Doki Airlines.

1404
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,420
Come on, thank you Superchallenge.

1405
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:03,720
Thank you.

1406
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,260
Thank you.

1407
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,420
Maybe if I just do a little...

1408
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:10,760
Okay.

1409
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,120
Maybe I have like 24.

1410
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,420
Okay.

1411
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:19,880
Okay.

1412
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,340
Okay.

1413
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:20,800
Okay.

1414
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,180
There you go.

1415
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,700
This should be the center now.

1416
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,480
Oh my god.

1417
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,580
Guys, I'm reading.

1418
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,520
I told you.

1419
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,440
All I need to do is learn...

1420
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,000
I just need to learn...

1421
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,280
I just need to learn how to take off.

1422
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,600
We're gonna learn how to land while we're on...

1423
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,200
in the air.

1424
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,420
Okay.

1425
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:40,920
Brake.

1426
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,920
Oh my god.

1427
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,680
Oh my god, we're doing it.

1428
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,040
Slowly.

1429
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,220
Come on.

1430
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,280
We're slowly getting there.

1431
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,100
All right.

1432
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,260
Slow and steady.

1433
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,060
Slow and steady, Doki.

1434
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,100
Slow and steady.

1435
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,840
You have multiple crashes now.

1436
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:06,840
You have multiple crashes now.

1437
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:08,780
All right.

1438
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,380
Here you go.

1439
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,000
And then...

1440
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,700
And then...

1441
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,920
Is that it?

1442
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,280
Yeah.

1443
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,100
We're gonna take off.

1444
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:23,420
We're gonna take off.

1445
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:23,880
We got pie-full power.

1446
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,660
She gave me permission.

1447
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,820
Oh my god.

1448
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,500
I'm in the center.

1449
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,480
Oh.

1450
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:28,960
Oh.

1451
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,460
Oh.

1452
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:29,960
Oh.

1453
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,600
Stay on the center line.

1454
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,180
And keep pushing power until you reach 55 knots.

1455
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,000
We're 55.

1456
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,100
Now slowly taxi onto the runway and align the plane with the center line.

1457
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,640
Then stop your plane just after the number 21.

1458
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:43,340
Then stop your plane just after the number 21.

1459
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,360
Oh.

1460
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,360
This is so...

1461
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:44,980
Whoa.

1462
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:45,660
Whoa.

1463
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,280
Whoa.

1464
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:46,840
Whoa.

1465
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,100
Whoa.

1466
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,220
Guys, I don't...

1467
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:49,960
Guys, it's okay.

1468
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,640
We don't...

1469
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,300
Guys.

1470
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:52,960
Guys.

1471
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,020
Okay.

1472
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,540
Pull back on the yoke to take off.

1473
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,220
There we go.

1474
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:57,700
Yay!

1475
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,880
Togi trip.

1476
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,320
We're doing it!

1477
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,960
We're in the air!

1478
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,980
We're 75.

1479
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,460
We're 75.

1480
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,060
We're 75.

1481
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,060
I know I'm 75.

1482
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:25,880
Oh.

1483
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,560
Oh.

1484
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:27,420
75.

1485
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,300
Okay.

1486
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:29,800
Where am I?

1487
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:30,520
5000?

1488
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,720
I don't know where's 5000.

1489
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:33,120
Oh.

1490
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,300
I want to turn on the heat though.

1491
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,300
My butt is getting a little cold.

1492
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,200
Yeah!

1493
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:38,680
Okay.

1494
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,820
Then we're going to turn on the lights.

1495
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,280
Yeah!

1496
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,640
And then...

1497
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,240
Oh.

1498
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:42,560
Oh.

1499
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:42,800
Oh.

1500
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,460
I need to pull up.

1501
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,020
I need to pull up.

1502
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,480
I need to pull up.

1503
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,020
Maintain heading...

1504
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,980
What's 210 degrees?

1505
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,000
Is this 210?

1506
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,320
Oh.

1507
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:52,800
Oh.

1508
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,020
It's okay.

1509
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:54,400
It's fine.

1510
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:55,660
Oh.

1511
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,380
There we go.

1512
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,020
What speed am I on?

1513
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,520
I'm learning!

1514
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,920
Am I getting higher?

1515
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,020
Oh my god.

1516
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:10,420
I'm getting higher!

1517
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:10,680
Look!

1518
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,900
Look at all these people down there!

1519
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,180
Who are very safe!

1520
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,000
Look at them!

1521
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,380
They're so...

1522
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,120
They're so safe right now.

1523
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,120
I don't know.

1524
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,080
I always like get scared when like...

1525
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,040
Whenever...

1526
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,880
I never want to live close to an airport.

1527
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,840
Well to be fair, other than like the noises and stuff...

1528
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,420
But like...

1529
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,200
I always get... like when the plane...

1530
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,860
When you hear the plane landing...

1531
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,780
Like hear the plane in the sky and you're like...

1532
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,800
Nocturne, thank you for the super chat.

1533
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,140
Thank you.

1534
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:42,460
Thank you.

1535
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:42,980
Flying?

1536
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,360
She's not even forklift certified.

1537
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,040
Yeah!

1538
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:48,740
Woo!

1539
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,200
Yay!

1540
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,220
Alright, I think we're ready.

1541
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,400
I think we're ready guys.

1542
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,180
I want to make sure I can handle like an actual aircraft.

1543
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,960
Air line training.

1544
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,320
Alright, this is it.

1545
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,240
This is like...

1546
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,880
We need to learn how to take off for this.

1547
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,380
And then we're gonna be ready.

1548
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:17,120
We just have to be able to drive a plane.

1549
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,040
Alright, here we go.

1550
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,160
We just need to be able to drive a real plane.

1551
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,380
A real fucking plane.

1552
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,800
Not the baby planes.

1553
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,080
Oh wait, what the fuck.

1554
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,240
Where's the wheel?

1555
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:35,980
Where's the wheel?

1556
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,200
Where the fuck...

1557
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,720
What happened to the wheel?

1558
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,020
What happened to the wheel?

1559
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,280
Where are all these buttons?

1560
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,580
Where are all these buttons?

1561
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,540
I'm gonna sit in the middle.

1562
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,300
Oh, we have autopilot!

1563
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,700
Alright, we're sitting in the middle.

1564
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,580
We're gonna be both pilot and co-pilot.

1565
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:20,300
MCDU?

1566
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,280
Numbers?

1567
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,100
PFD?

1568
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,120
What are these words?

1569
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,480
Or, this is like going from one ear to the other.

1570
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,700
I can't register what she's telling me to do.

1571
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,700
I don't need to save fuel, is it that?

1572
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,460
We don't need to save fuel.

1573
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,480
What is this?

1574
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:31,840
Move both thrust levers gently forward to 50% and 1.

1575
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,620
Is that 50%?

1576
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,780
Then move that to the flex detent.

1577
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:49,300
Move thrust levers to selected takeoff thrust by pressing A.

1578
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,520
Is that...

1579
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,440
Is that it?

1580
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:06,390
Is that...

1581
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,740
Am I doing it?

1582
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,040
Did I...

1583
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,160
Did I do it?

1584
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,240
Am I gonna fly now?

1585
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,120
Is that the ocean?

1586
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,560
Oh, we're fly... we're flying!

1587
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,640
Guys!

1588
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,820
Guys, we're flying!

1589
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,940
Overspeed.

1590
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:44,160
Overspeed.

1591
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,380
Overspeed.

1592
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,300
Overspeed.

1593
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:46,540
Overspeed.

1594
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,740
Overspeed.

1595
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,920
Overspeed.

1596
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,940
Overspeed.

1597
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,920
Overspeed.

1598
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,740
Overspeed.

1599
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,480
Overspeed.

1600
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,660
Overspeed.

1601
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,820
Overspeed.

1602
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,830
Overspeed.

1603
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,550
What does that mean?

1604
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,950
I'm not on the rudder.

1605
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,330
I'm not on... Oh hey, there's people.

1606
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,370
Oh autopilot.

1607
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,070
Look at city.

1608
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:44,490
What the...

1609
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:46,410
Climb?

1610
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:47,250
Press B?

1611
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:50,510
What?

1612
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,750
What's over speeding?

1613
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:53,130
I don't know!

1614
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:57,890
What is over speeding?

1615
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,330
Over speed.

1616
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:02,590
Over speed.

1617
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,630
I'm like what?

1618
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:05,270
What does that mean?

1619
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,550
Where's my flight attendant?

1620
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:09,570
I did it.

1621
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,530
Oh wait, I did not do it.

1622
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:11,750
What?

1623
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:14,870
How did I fail?

1624
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,960
It means over speed.

1625
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:38,200
At 10,000 feet or 4,000 meters, once over the target, roll over and cut the throttle.

1626
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:41,000
Pull stick up to 90 angle degree.

1627
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:41,940
Hold on to...

1628
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1629
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,380
Guys, I think I'm ready.

1630
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,300
Guys.

1631
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,500
Guys, I think I'm actually ready guys.

1632
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,940
For real this time.

1633
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,180
Okay, we're gonna grab a...

1634
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,760
We're gonna grab a real plane.

1635
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,020
A real person plane.

1636
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,120
Wait, do I not have the real planes?

1637
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:03,840
Oh no, it's up here.

1638
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,740
Okay, air... wait.

1639
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:06,880
Is that a real plane?

1640
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,460
Oh my god, the Boeing!

1641
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,620
We're grabbing a real plane.

1642
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,220
Okay, and then that's gonna be my plane.

1643
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,480
I think I learned enough.

1644
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:16,340
Guys.

1645
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:16,740
Oh my god.

1646
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,000
Oh my god, I can be green!

1647
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,940
I can be blue.

1648
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:20,800
I can be...

1649
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,180
Oh my god, the aviators club!

1650
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:27,760
Alright, here.

1651
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:28,860
I'm gonna be that plane.

1652
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,680
And then...

1653
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,220
I'm gonna do...

1654
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,060
Wait, I can customize?

1655
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,880
Flight number!

1656
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:35,840
Okay.

1657
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,600
My flight number will be...

1658
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,520
Okay, I was gonna write it really fucked up.

1659
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,100
Nice.

1660
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:46,500
Nice.

1661
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,660
Alright, nice.

1662
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,380
Alright, there we go.

1663
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,120
That's gonna be my flight number.

1664
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:52,560
Oh no!

1665
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:53,140
No!

1666
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:53,840
My flight!

1667
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:54,780
Okay, there we go.

1668
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,680
Alright, we're gonna...

1669
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,040
Where should we go to?

1670
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,340
Let's see.

1671
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,100
We should go to...

1672
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:04,600
Let's see.

1673
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,820
Who wants me to...

1674
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,100
Who wants me to...

1675
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,400
Be at their airport?

1676
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,500
I can't move.

1677
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,140
Okay.

1678
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:13,960
Whoa!

1679
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,240
That was a weird globe spin.

1680
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,620
Oh my god, I should fly at night time.

1681
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,320
Alright, the UK.

1682
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,900
Nothing bad happens in the UK.

1683
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:23,760
Glasgow.

1684
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,100
Alright, we're gonna...

1685
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,660
Departure Glasgow.

1686
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,180
And then we're gonna head over to...

1687
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,500
We're gonna head over...

1688
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,180
Oh my god, wait.

1689
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:36,780
What's this?

1690
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,260
We could go to...

1691
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,780
We're gonna go to...

1692
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:43,940
You know what?

1693
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:44,660
Let's go to...

1694
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,180
Let's go to Germany.

1695
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,540
Alright.

1696
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,020
Arrival.

1697
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,800
There we go.

1698
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,040
Nice.

1699
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,200
Alright, EU goons.

1700
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:54,760
This is for you!

1701
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:55,740
Ow!

1702
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1703
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:56,860
Thank you.

1704
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:57,480
Thank you.

1705
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,680
What could possibly... Exactly!

1706
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,800
What could possibly go wrong?

1707
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,500
Is that Germany?

1708
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:04,200
That's Belgium.

1709
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:04,620
Sorry.

1710
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,360
My European...

1711
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,320
This is for you, EU goons!

1712
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,180
As I ruin geography.

1713
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:12,760
As I ruin geography.

1714
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,440
We're going to Belgium!

1715
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,500
We're going to Belgium!

1716
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,260
They know German there too!

1717
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,740
They're like...

1718
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:26,400
They know German, French, and English because they're squashed up by like several other countries.

1719
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,600
Is that Belgium or is that a different country?

1720
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,280
No, I should be right.

1721
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,900
Because we all know I'm great at geography.

1722
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:37,460
Okay.

1723
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,220
Alright, don't worry EU goons!

1724
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,560
As I mess up!

1725
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,040
Oh my god!

1726
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,840
Where are the lights?

1727
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,040
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

1728
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,340
Um...

1729
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,380
Where can I turn on the light?

1730
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,940
Give me a sec.

1731
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,760
The pilot...

1732
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,320
There's buttons behind me?!

1733
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,700
What the fuck?

1734
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,160
Oh my god!

1735
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,080
Why is there buttons behind me?

1736
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:10,340
Okay.

1737
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,000
Um, no.

1738
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:12,840
I'm gonna put...

1739
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,380
I'm gonna put my brake back on.

1740
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,320
No, it'll be fine.

1741
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:15,760
Okay.

1742
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:16,960
Um...

1743
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,280
Oh my god, there's a yoke!

1744
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,000
Oh my god, how do I turn on the lights?

1745
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:26,760
Okay.

1746
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:32,040
Guys, I'm trying to figure out how to turn on the lights right now.

1747
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,200
Give me a sec.

1748
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,020
Okay, that's...

1749
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,760
Oh!

1750
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:36,960
Instrument lighting.

1751
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,820
Okay, that's already at 100.

1752
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,120
Okay.

1753
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,760
Map brightness.

1754
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:43,120
Okay.

1755
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:45,180
Inoperative.

1756
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,260
Okay.

1757
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,180
NDF brightness.

1758
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,900
How do I...

1759
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,400
How do I turn on the lights above me?

1760
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:54,900
Guys.

1761
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,080
Guys.

1762
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,140
The captain needs some help right now.

1763
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,460
I need more lights.

1764
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,180
Press F for flashlights.

1765
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,200
Guys.

1766
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,800
Oh my god.

1767
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,040
Maybe I shouldn't have driven at night time.

1768
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,440
Guys, I realized night time was the...

1769
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:09,820
mistake.

1770
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,960
Oh, I could get the ATC on.

1771
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,560
Okay, alright.

1772
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,260
ATC, tell me what to do.

1773
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,580
Flight Assistant.

1774
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,660
Okay, Flight Assistant.

1775
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,980
That's not assisting me right now.

1776
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,660
Alright, let's see.

1777
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,120
What is that?

1778
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,020
Is that the map?

1779
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,120
Oh my god, that's where we are.

1780
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,320
Let's put the map here.

1781
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,500
This is where like all the overlays are out for us too.

1782
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:39,880
The checklist, the basic control, travel to, weather.

1783
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,920
Alright, and then... Okay guys, we're gonna change the date.

1784
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,740
We're gonna... Guys, I realize...

1785
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,180
Let's make it the morning now.

1786
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,220
We're gonna adjust everything here.

1787
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,700
Alright, and then... Let's see.

1788
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,760
Oh, what is this?

1789
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,920
Okay, we're gonna put that here as well.

1790
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,740
And then... What's this?

1791
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,480
The camera.

1792
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,640
What's the camera?

1793
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,800
What is the camera?

1794
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,700
What is the camera?

1795
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,600
Okay, I found the light switch.

1796
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,240
That's why I was thinking about the Super Chat.

1797
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,520
Thank you, thank you.

1798
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:26,180
Okay, your captain is figuring out the controls.

1799
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,820
She's gonna block the entire screen.

1800
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,260
Alright.

1801
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:34,820
Alright guys, don't worry.

1802
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,660
I turned on... I found the light switch, chat!

1803
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,120
Chat, I found the light switch.

1804
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:39,860
I turned on it.

1805
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,320
I found the sun!

1806
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,440
I did it!

1807
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:43,540
Alright.

1808
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,520
Do I... What's the camera, chat?

1809
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,000
What is that?

1810
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,460
What is that?

1811
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,540
The main light?

1812
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,540
The light switch of the Earth?

1813
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:05,460
Okay.

1814
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,940
Okay, now I can't see my plane anymore.

1815
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:12,940
Uhhhh...

1816
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,340
Oh, is it... Do I take pictures of me driving the plane with the camera?

1817
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,000
Okay.

1818
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,940
Um... Oh guys, I think it was a bad idea for having all these overlays.

1819
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,940
I need to put... Turn off these overlays, chat.

1820
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,100
Guys, I think it was a bad idea.

1821
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:32,840
We don't need the ATC.

1822
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,240
Alright, I think we're ready.

1823
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,060
Guys, I think we're ready.

1824
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,400
Okay, give me an immerse.

1825
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,300
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1826
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,340
Let me... Let me pull something up real quick.

1827
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,160
Uh...

1828
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,280
Alright, give me a sec, guys.

1829
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,400
Give me a sec.

1830
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,240
Let me pull something up real quick.

1831
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:52,640
Okay.

1832
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:55,180
Um...

1833
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,860
Alright, are you guys ready for the immersion?

1834
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:05,320
Um... Ladies and gentlemen, uh... Welcome aboard to Flight 69.

1835
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,420
Uh... We're serviced from... Where are we?

1836
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:11,640
Glasgow to, uh... Brussels.

1837
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,420
We're currently third in line for takeoff and are expected to be in the air in approximately, uh...

1838
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:26,400
We ask that you please fasten your seat belts at this time and, uh...

1839
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:33,680
Secure all baggages underneath your seat or in your, uh... Overhead compartments.

1840
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:39,000
Uh... We also ask that your seats and table trays are in the upright position for takeoff.

1841
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,540
Uh... Please turn off your seat belts.

1842
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,760
Turn off all...

1843
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:48,400
Please turn on all personal electronic devices and, uh... Including laptops and cell phones.

1844
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:54,620
So you can be sure to have Doki Bird on your screen watching her, uh... Drive this plane.

1845
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:01,440
Smoking is allowed for the duration of the flight, uh... Because she likes the challenge.

1846
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:05,180
Thank you for choosing Doki Airlines and enjoy your flight.

1847
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,860
Okay, okay, okay.

1848
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,500
Sorry.

1849
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:19,420
Uh... Good afternoon, passengers.

1850
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,640
That was the flight attendant announcement.

1851
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:24,440
I am also your flight attendant and your pilot.

1852
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,560
Just do not worry.

1853
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,400
When our pilot starts in, I'm gonna start serving you guys drinks.

1854
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,840
Anyway, this is your captain speaking now.

1855
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,620
First, I'd like to welcome everyone on, uh... On the Doki Airlines Flight 69.

1856
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,380
We're currently at... We're currently not cruising at any altitude.

1857
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:49,100
Uh... The time is... Uh... We've, like, turned on the sun and the time should be around 6.45 a.m.

1858
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,100
Uh... The weather looks good!

1859
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:56,080
When the tailwind outside, we're expected to land in... In... In... In Brussels.

1860
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,940
In Brussels, approximately, uh... 15 hours behind schedule.

1861
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,060
Uh...

1862
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,320
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the rest of the flight.

1863
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,680
Alright, I think we're good.

1864
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,280
I think we're good.

1865
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,620
I think the passengers are okay, chat.

1866
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,800
I think the passengers know what's up.

1867
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,660
Alright, guys.

1868
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:20,460
This is it.

1869
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,060
We've trained for this.

1870
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,660
Dragoons, we've trained for this.

1871
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,540
Am I on?

1872
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,900
Apply throw throttle.

1873
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,000
Alright.

1874
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,100
That should be full.

1875
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,100
Oh, that's a lot of numbers going up.

1876
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:41,760
Woah.

1877
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:43,760
Alright.

1878
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,440
We're just gonna keep the aircraft straight.

1879
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,880
That was a lot of numbers that I saw going up.

1880
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,020
But that should be good.

1881
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,000
One Doki airline ticket, please.

1882
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,360
See?

1883
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,140
Thank you for the matcha soup.

1884
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:54,820
Thank you.

1885
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,460
Thank you.

1886
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,980
People believe in me.

1887
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,000
Alright.

1888
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:00,860
We're good?

1889
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,360
It's 104.

1890
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,140
Okay, we're pretty sure all of these are up.

1891
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:09,900
Oh, I forgot.

1892
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,680
There we go.

1893
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,560
I had my brakes on.

1894
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,220
Do not worry.

1895
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,300
The pilot knows what she's doing.

1896
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:17,500
Alright, here we go.

1897
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:18,900
Yay!

1898
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,040
Am I in the center?

1899
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,440
I am, right?

1900
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,440
This has to be the center, right?

1901
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,540
Yeah!

1902
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,580
Agent, thank you for the matcha soup.

1903
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,260
Let me look away from...

1904
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:36,160
Okay, raise aircraft nose and lift off.

1905
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,080
Okay.

1906
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:38,740
Don't worry.

1907
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:39,880
We're doing it.

1908
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,200
We're going higher.

1909
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,400
There's no overdrive.

1910
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,880
We're going higher now.

1911
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:49,820
Alright.

1912
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:51,460
It's fine.

1913
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,460
Raise landing gear.

1914
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,820
What the fuck is landing gear?

1915
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:02,640
You love it when you hear your pilot say what the fuck is landing gear.

1916
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:03,880
Can I...

1917
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,940
How do I turn on autopilot?

1918
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,220
Is the autopilot on?

1919
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,860
Do I have to drive this myself now?

1920
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,060
I can't believe my captain is my OSHA.

1921
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,500
We're not gonna make it, bros.

1922
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,880
But it's been an amazing ride!

1923
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,320
What the fuck?

1924
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:17,480
Where are you believers?

1925
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:18,160
Oh.

1926
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,960
Where are my believers in chat?

1927
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,020
Glasgow Tower, Boeing Alpha Sierra.

1928
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,780
747 frequency change.

1929
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,120
Am I going up?

1930
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,640
747 is tight.

1931
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,000
Boeing B748, four miles southwest of Glasgow.

1932
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,260
2,400 feet.

1933
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,540
Am I doing it?

1934
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,960
I don't need clearance.

1935
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,420
I'm DokiBird.

1936
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,400
Boeing Alpha Sierra, 747 class.

1937
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,500
Okay, we gotta go this way.

1938
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,420
Boeing 747.

1939
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,850
Cleared through the Charlie airspace.

1940
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,380
I think we're okay, right?

1941
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,580
Cleared through the Charlie airspace, Boeing 747.

1942
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:09,920
I did it!

1943
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:10,560
They cleared us!

1944
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,260
Guys, they cleared us!

1945
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,560
Guys, the turbulence!

1946
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,180
Passengers, please remain in your seats.

1947
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,080
We're experiencing some mass turbulence right now.

1948
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,740
So do not worry.

1949
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:27,040
This is just turbulence.

1950
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,420
It's not the pilot doing a funky dr- Oh my god!

1951
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,600
Okay, we gotta go higher.

1952
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,900
I wanna do a barrel roll.

1953
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:45,220
On my- There's this like, famous like fucking video where like, uh, passengers were gonna perform a sick barrel roll right now.

1954
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,380
Wait, let me see if I can pull it up.

1955
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,360
Wait, I'm gonna find it.

1956
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,360
Okay guys, I'm tabbing it.

1957
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,180
I think I should be fine.

1958
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,720
I think my plane will be okay.

1959
01:23:59,280 --> 01:23:59,720
Okay.

1960
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:00,860
Uh...

1961
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,560
Let me see if I can find that audio clip.

1962
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:07,260
Pilot...

1963
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,080
Pilot, okay.

1964
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:10,660
Uh, audio.

1965
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,580
Oh my god, it was like, so long ago.

1966
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:13,860
Okay.

1967
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,680
It was like, airplane...

1968
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,040
Um...

1969
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,760
Oh, I don't remember where it is!

1970
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:22,300
No!

1971
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,740
I don't remember what it's called!

1972
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:24,980
Oh no.

1973
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:25,880
Oh shit, okay.

1974
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,060
Don't worry, we're fine!

1975
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,060
I tapped out, it's fine!

1976
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,900
Did he just say goodbye?

1977
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:34,380
We're fine.

1978
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:36,920
Does anyone remember that audio clip?

1979
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,840
It was from Tumblr.

1980
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:38,720
By the way.

1981
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:48,740
For anyone- The audio clip of the fucking guy that was pretending to be a pilot and he's like, Don't worry passengers, we're gonna perform a sick barrel roll.

1982
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:50,580
I hear you.

1983
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,760
See, I told you!

1984
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:54,500
We're fine!

1985
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,740
You can use your phone and...

1986
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:58,720
And...

1987
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:03,160
See?

1988
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:04,240
Look!

1989
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,220
Everybody's okay!

1990
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,440
Where the fuck is my food, flight attendant?

1991
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,080
Alright.

1992
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,840
Can't wait for me to- Oh god, I just remember we never learned how to land.

1993
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,960
We never learned how- Guys!

1994
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,260
I just realized we never learned how to land the plane.

1995
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,020
We'll be fine!

1996
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,140
We're losing altitude?

1997
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,660
How do you know I'm losing altitude?

1998
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:33,000
I can barely read any of these.

1999
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:35,320
Is it cause I'm going down?

2000
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,660
Good day.

2001
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,420
How do you- You're stoked out.

2002
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:49,520
Oh, they're saying goodbye!

2003
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,440
Glasgow approach Boeing Alpha Sierra.

2004
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:52,920
74710- Is that me?

2005
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:53,680
Oh, that's me!

2006
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,300
Boeing Alpha 2

2007
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:00,910
radar contact.

2008
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:01,590
I think we're fine.

2009
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:07,590
Like, we're like 420- Oh, I should've- I should've selected a closer place.

2010
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,170
It's way too loud.

2011
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:11,110
Good day.

2012
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,530
Okay, I'm gonna pull up...

2013
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,270
and then I'm gonna tab out.

2014
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:22,680
We're fine!

2015
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,860
Boeing Alpha Sierra.

2016
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,060
74710- We should be fine.

2017
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:29,220
...

2018
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,460
...

2019
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:33,210
...

2020
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:36,010
Does it- Can you tell that I'm not tabbed into the game yet?

2021
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,070
Can you tell?

2022
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:39,410
We're fine!

2023
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:41,350
Everybody's fine!

2024
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:43,410
Stop panicking!

2025
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,410
Guys, look!

2026
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:47,770
We're okay!

2027
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,970
Why is everybody panicking?

2028
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,550
...

2029
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:53,710
Boeing Alpha Sierra.

2030
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:57,090
74711- We didn't learn to land.

2031
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:58,610
I think that's like the worst part.

2032
01:26:59,550 --> 01:26:59,650
Boeing Alpha Sierra.

2033
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:00,990
74711- Press quick approach altimeter.

2034
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:05,030
2-9-10- I think the worst part is that we actually did not learn how to land this plane.

2035
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,930
So like, that's gonna be...

2036
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:12,810
That's gonna be an issue for us later on.

2037
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:15,990
We actually forgot to learn how to...

2038
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,850
land the plane.

2039
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,130
Boeing Alpha Sierra.

2040
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:19,170
875.

2041
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:20,870
Boeing 747- Guys!

2042
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:24,730
Why did you guys forgot to teach me how to land the plane?

2043
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,910
We all had one job!

2044
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,470
Boeing Alpha Sierra.

2045
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,790
747- Scottish Central Altimeter.

2046
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:31,610
This is so far away.

2047
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:33,990
I'm just gonna land here on the Stonehill Farm.

2048
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:35,770
Fuck this.

2049
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:36,710
I'm just gonna land here.

2050
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:40,570
Alright, I'm gonna land in the Stonehill Farm airstrip.

2051
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:42,110
This is way too far.

2052
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:42,710
I chose the...

2053
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:44,810
The destination I chose was way too far.

2054
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:52,410
This is gonna take us forever!

2055
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:55,690
It's like 414 like...

2056
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:57,050
something meters!

2057
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:59,750
To the farm we go.

2058
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:04,030
Wait, how do I use autopilot?

2059
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,890
I forgot how to use the autopilot.

2060
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:07,830
Which button is that?

2061
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:10,630
Is this?

2062
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,090
Did I click autopilot?

2063
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:15,410
I think I did.

2064
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,150
Did I do it?

2065
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,400
No, I don't want autopilot.

2066
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:25,700
Okay.

2067
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,540
I don't know what I pressed.

2068
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,300
Wait, am I high enough for a barrel roll?

2069
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:31,720
Okay, guys.

2070
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,720
The moment we get closer...

2071
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,740
What did I click?

2072
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,800
Were we sideways?

2073
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:49,240
The autopilot tried to realign me.

2074
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,560
So I'm like, oh my god.

2075
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,520
Was I unaligned this entire time?

2076
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,100
Please go higher?

2077
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:54,760
But why?

2078
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,940
It doesn't matter.

2079
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,360
There's no people down there.

2080
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,680
There might be people in the flame.

2081
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:01,780
There's no people.

2082
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,580
There's no people down there.

2083
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,440
They don't care.

2084
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:09,840
I'm flying.

2085
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,140
There's still 400 away?

2086
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,500
Oh my god.

2087
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,940
This is going to take forever.

2088
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:17,540
Bro.

2089
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,200
Oh.

2090
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:18,700
Oh.

2091
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:19,600
Oh.

2092
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,120
Oh.

2093
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:21,320
Oh.

2094
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:24,020
Oh.

2095
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:24,640
I'm just saying.

2096
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:25,720
We all have to...

2097
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,100
We all have like important appointments.

2098
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:28,640
Okay.

2099
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:29,940
Okay.

2100
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:30,860
I'm thinking of a super chat.

2101
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,160
Thank you.

2102
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:31,820
Thank you.

2103
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,720
Imagine you're flying.

2104
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,960
Let's set the IRL.

2105
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:37,000
I'll just land here in the middle of nowhere.

2106
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,160
Thank you for the super chat.

2107
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:39,600
Thank you.

2108
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,160
Thank you.

2109
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,720
No, don't keep my flight at speed of heart.

2110
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,180
Please don't give me anxiety.

2111
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,540
Thank you for the super chat.

2112
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:49,960
Thank you.

2113
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:50,620
Thank you.

2114
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,620
What do you mean?

2115
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,000
I am fucking flying perfectly.

2116
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:54,980
Look.

2117
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:56,900
Everybody's...

2118
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:57,880
Everything's fine.

2119
01:29:58,860 --> 01:29:59,640
Everything's fine.

2120
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:00,400
Chat.

2121
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:01,120
Everything.

2122
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:08,520
Make sure you have your electronic devices on with Wi-Fi on too so you can watch a Doki Bird stream.

2123
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,160
Okay.

2124
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:11,980
All right, guys.

2125
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,140
I think we're doing pretty well.

2126
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:13,780
See?

2127
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,820
Am I high enough in the sky?

2128
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:17,820
I should be higher.

2129
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,080
Like, I don't think it's good that I can see the city.

2130
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,940
Like, I don't think...

2131
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:23,980
I just realized.

2132
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,120
I just realized it might not be a good thing that the city is like in my view.

2133
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,240
So maybe I should be a little higher.

2134
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,020
I feel like...

2135
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:33,540
Right?

2136
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:34,380
Yeah.

2137
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,280
I should not be able to see the city.

2138
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:38,800
Wait.

2139
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:39,540
Are the gears down?

2140
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:39,840
Wait.

2141
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:40,440
What does that mean?

2142
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:41,740
What do you mean?

2143
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,260
What altitude am I on?

2144
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,740
Does it tell me what altitude I'm on?

2145
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,000
Why is it only at two?

2146
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:47,700
Okay.

2147
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,200
There it is.

2148
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:49,280
I see it's at the bottom right.

2149
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,300
You don't see it, but I see the altitude.

2150
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:53,180
I'm going to keep pulling up until the altitude...

2151
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:53,420
Oh.

2152
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:53,720
Oh.

2153
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:53,980
Oh.

2154
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,100
Oh.

2155
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:54,120
Oh.

2156
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:54,420
Oh.

2157
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,180
What's that sound?

2158
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,100
That's a good job sound, right?

2159
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,780
That should be the good job.

2160
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,020
Okay.

2161
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,500
I'm like 16,000.

2162
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:01,220
Okay.

2163
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:01,660
Okay.

2164
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:02,120
Here we go.

2165
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,600
All right.

2166
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:07,940
Here we go.

2167
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,080
I'm at 17,000 altitude now.

2168
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,200
All right.

2169
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:11,600
Here we go.

2170
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:13,060
All right.

2171
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:13,560
This is good.

2172
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:13,940
That's good.

2173
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,500
I should be higher, though.

2174
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,640
I feel like I should be at like 20K, right?

2175
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:19,900
Half the fuel.

2176
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,960
It's been half the fuel this entire time.

2177
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,600
Okay, I should be...

2178
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:23,980
Guys.

2179
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:27,840
Guys, what is the optimal amount of altitude that I should be on?

2180
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,500
Because I'm at 17,000 right now.

2181
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:31,860
30k?

2182
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,060
Okay, we're so fucking far.

2183
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,820
Can I turn on my autopilot?

2184
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:41,100
Is my autopilot on?

2185
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:41,780
No.

2186
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,960
Is my autopilot?

2187
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,060
What is my autopilot doing?

2188
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,160
What is it doing?

2189
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,500
Why is it going down?

2190
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:51,600
Autopilot, go back up.

2191
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,220
Where is my autopilot doing?

2192
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:58,440
I turned off autopilot because I couldn't tell what they're doing.

2193
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,800
I couldn't tell what it's doing.

2194
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,320
It was going down!

2195
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,820
It's flying around, but it's right there.

2196
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,140
It's right in front of me.

2197
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,120
Why would it change its course?

2198
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,980
Here's to your heading and altitude.

2199
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,220
The altitude?

2200
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,640
But we have to go up.

2201
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:20,700
We need to go up.

2202
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:21,580
We need to go up.

2203
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:27,260
I am doing a better job than... I wonder what does these do?

2204
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,460
I wonder what happens if I turn on all of these.

2205
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,060
What's this?

2206
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:35,960
Oh, that's the brakes.

2207
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,800
I should not touch that.

2208
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,060
But like, what are all these buttons though?

2209
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,240
The rudder trim?

2210
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,120
What does this do?

2211
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:50,960
That's not good, right?

2212
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,460
Oh, turn on your seat belts, everybody!

2213
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,140
Turn off your seat belts!

2214
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,140
Wait.

2215
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:58,600
Off.

2216
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,760
I'm gonna turn it off.

2217
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,180
Guys, turn off your seat belts!

2218
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,720
Oh, that's how they do it!

2219
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:05,800
Oh!

2220
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,440
Guys, we're at 20k!

2221
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,960
Guys, oh my god.

2222
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,640
Guys, we're at 20k, guys.

2223
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,200
Okay.

2224
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,440
Alright, and then, what is this?

2225
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,380
Okay, that's the seat belts are off.

2226
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,080
That's good.

2227
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,000
That's all we wanted.

2228
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,560
And then... where are these buttons?

2229
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,220
Where are these buttons, dude?

2230
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:35,580
Am I... Okay, we're okay.

2231
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,260
We're okay.

2232
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,180
I just have to be sure.

2233
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,440
I have to be sure that we're okay.

2234
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,180
Oh, that's way too close.

2235
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,600
I don't wanna look at the controls like that.

2236
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,220
Oh my god, it's still so far!

2237
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,180
Oh, let me fix the controls here.

2238
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,280
There we go.

2239
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:52,800
There we go.

2240
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,420
Alright.

2241
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:57,820
Wait, where the fuck is the... where are we?

2242
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,960
Okay, and then, we're gonna...

2243
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,020
Let's see...

2244
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:04,780
Where are all these other buttons, though?

2245
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:07,800
Transporter mode...

2246
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:09,760
TA...

2247
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,500
I know what these buttons does, but they look cool.

2248
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:13,440
Oooh!

2249
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,660
This is like radio...

2250
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:14,900
Oh!

2251
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:15,280
Oh!

2252
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:15,560
Oh!

2253
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:15,780
Oh!

2254
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:16,040
Oh!

2255
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:16,400
Oh!

2256
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:16,600
Oh!

2257
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:16,780
Oh!

2258
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:16,840
Oh!

2259
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:17,020
Oh!

2260
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:17,220
Oh!

2261
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:17,420
Oh!

2262
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:17,620
Oh!

2263
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:17,640
Oh!

2264
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:17,680
Oh!

2265
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:17,800
Oh!

2266
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,020
Oh!

2267
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:18,020
Oh!

2268
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:18,200
Oh!

2269
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:18,200
Oh!

2270
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:18,340
Oh!

2271
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:18,500
Oh!

2272
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:18,500
Oh!

2273
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:18,580
Oh!

2274
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:18,580
Oh!

2275
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:18,580
Oh!

2276
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:18,580
Oh!

2277
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:18,580
Oh!

2278
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:18,880
Oh!

2279
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:19,740
Oh!

2280
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:19,780
Oh!

2281
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:19,780
Oh!

2282
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:19,780
Oh!

2283
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:19,780
Oh!

2284
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:19,780
Oh!

2285
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:19,800
Oh!

2286
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2287
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:20,780
Okay.

2288
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:21,500
There we go.

2289
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:28,340
Sorry, I just realized that my things started going... wait, what about the controls above me?

2290
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:29,420
What are these?

2291
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,140
Oh, cabin temperature!

2292
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:37,290
There we go.

2293
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:39,750
I gotta make sure we're extra nice and cozy.

2294
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,510
And then... there we go.

2295
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:43,710
Now that seems better.

2296
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:44,690
There we go.

2297
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:46,250
Now everybody is nice and cozy.

2298
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:50,430
And then... what do all these buttons do?

2299
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:53,210
Cover?

2300
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,710
What the fuck does cover do?

2301
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,570
That's what you want to hear your pilot say.

2302
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:00,810
What the fuck do all these buttons do?

2303
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:05,790
Cabin temperature, cargo temperature...

2304
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:09,910
APU starter...

2305
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:10,610
Oh!

2306
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:13,290
Oh!

2307
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:14,250
It's to... oh!

2308
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:19,590
That'll be fun, right?

2309
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:22,990
Oh!

2310
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:23,410
Whoa!

2311
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:24,930
Is everything okay?

2312
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,160
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, is everything okay?

2313
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,360
It's fine, we're fine.

2314
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:38,580
What do you mean we're gonna crash?

2315
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,880
Did I turn off the engine?

2316
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,920
Oh, did I turn off... oh, what did I press?

2317
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:46,640
Oh, I turned off the engine!

2318
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:47,660
Ah!

2319
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,140
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine!

2320
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,280
We're still in the air!

2321
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,580
We're still in the air!

2322
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:02,720
We're still in the air!

2323
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,020
Guys!

2324
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,120
How do I turn it back on?!

2325
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,900
I pressed so many buttons!

2326
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,160
I pressed so many buttons!

2327
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:12,580
Guys.

2328
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,240
Guys.

2329
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,640
How do I... what did I press?

2330
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:17,660
Is it the battery?

2331
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,060
Where is it?

2332
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:20,300
Where is the battery?

2333
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,740
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, where is it?

2334
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:27,820
Oh my god!

2335
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:34,440
Oh my god, oh my god.

2336
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:35,740
Did I do it?

2337
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,920
Did I do it?

2338
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:37,900
Did I turn it back on?

2339
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,020
Guys, it's okay.

2340
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:41,960
It's okay guys.

2341
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,700
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

2342
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,600
Guys, none of the lights are on.

2343
01:36:56,860 --> 01:37:00,720
I don't know why I should be alarmed, but all the lights are off.

2344
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:09,790
Okay.

2345
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,590
I don't know why I should be alarmed.

2346
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,760
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2347
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,560
Oh, oh, oh, I turned it on.

2348
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:29,180
Oh!

2349
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,680
Guys, we're okay.

2350
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,780
Guys, we're okay.

2351
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:46,550
We're okay guys.

2352
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:50,190
Guys, they locked my thing.

2353
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:57,000
Guys, I think the autopilot went on automatically.

2354
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,680
Wait, are my engines off?

2355
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,130
Where's the engines?

2356
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:21,700
Battery, AC, generator, on, on, on, on, on.

2357
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,080
Everything's on.

2358
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,260
119er, decimal 875, Boeing 747.

2359
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:31,340
Scottish Centre, Boeing Alpha Sierra, 747.

2360
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:32,820
8,600 feet.

2361
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:33,300
Middle?

2362
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,700
Why did I turn it off?

2363
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,980
I pressed so many buttons.

2364
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:43,620
I turned off so many buttons.

2365
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:49,780
Guys, I don't know why I turned it off.

2366
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:53,120
There were so many buttons, guys.

2367
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,280
Oh, the throttle is down!

2368
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,260
Here we go.

2369
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:05,770
It won't let me fly anymore.

2370
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,240
Can I turn the autopilot off?

2371
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,900
Is it because I have autopilot on?

2372
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,620
They're not letting me have control of the plane!

2373
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,520
Guys, caution!

2374
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:33,840
We don't have control of the plane anymore!

2375
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:35,280
Guys, caution!

2376
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,200
Okay, we have to figure out which is the engine.

2377
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,480
We're just gliding.

2378
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,000
We're just gliding.

2379
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,660
I can't... where the fuck is the engine?

2380
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:56,420
APU generator?

2381
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:57,860
Where the fuck is that?

2382
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,900
They didn't teach me this at pilot school!

2383
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,880
APU, APU.

2384
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,960
Where the fuck is... Oh, there it is!

2385
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:07,640
Oh, it is on!

2386
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:08,700
Oh!

2387
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:09,900
Did I turn it on?

2388
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,660
I have it on!

2389
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:14,420
On.

2390
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:15,580
On.

2391
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,000
Are we okay?

2392
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,780
We're sort of off course.

2393
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,220
We're so off course.

2394
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:27,220
It is!

2395
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:27,700
It's on!

2396
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:28,900
I turned it on!

2397
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:31,920
Everything is on!

2398
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,840
I hit the ignition?

2399
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:36,820
Where the fuck is that?

2400
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,320
There's a TV?

2401
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,180
Guys, I don't... I think we're off course.

2402
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,840
We're so off course.

2403
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,220
Guys, our altitude is going down.

2404
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,340
Guys, our altitude is going down!

2405
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,180
Oh, no!

2406
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:58,160
Oh, no!

2407
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,740
We're gonna be okay!

2408
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,560
We're gonna be okay!

2409
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,120
Oh, no!

2410
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,020
I can't!

2411
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:12,260
It's not... The autopilot won't let me pull up!

2412
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:13,940
Oh, no!

2413
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,660
We're... Okay, okay, we're gonna figure this out.

2414
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:18,980
We're gonna save the day!

2415
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:20,800
Oh, my God!

2416
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,720
Where the fuck is the engine?

2417
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:25,780
Closed.

2418
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:26,900
Oh, no.

2419
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:27,660
Oh, no.

2420
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,460
We're at 2000 altitude, guys.

2421
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:31,280
We're at 2000... Closed?

2422
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:31,720
Open?

2423
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,500
Is that it?

2424
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:39,320
Oh, what the fuck?

2425
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:41,640
Oh...

2426
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:42,880
Oh!

2427
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,900
Guys, it was...

2428
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,640
Guys, we hit the ocean!

2429
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:48,460
That...

2430
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:54,760
Guys!

2431
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,640
Oh, no!

2432
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,500
Guys, we're gonna land safely!

2433
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,900
It's gonna be so safe!

2434
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,340
300, 200, 100...

2435
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:05,990
We're safe.

2436
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:09,390
We're so safe.

2437
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:12,090
Guys, we're so... We're so okay.

2438
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:13,650
We are so okay.

2439
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:15,630
We're so... We're so okay!

2440
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:17,110
Guys, the plane is still intact!

2441
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:19,430
The plane is still intact!

2442
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:23,950
End of flight.

2443
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:27,270
Guys, see?

2444
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:30,030
Everything is okay.

2445
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:32,610
Um...

2446
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,870
Dude...

2447
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:34,670
...

2448
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:35,530
...

2449
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:39,150
...

2450
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:43,510
To automatically reset the aircraft in the air?

2451
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:46,870
It's like nothing bad happened.

2452
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:49,010
Hello.

2453
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:50,430
...

2454
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:55,850
Um.

2455
01:42:58,310 --> 01:43:00,230
Um, passengers.

2456
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:02,750
Welcome to Dokey flight 69.

2457
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:23,290
Saved.

2458
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:26,330
Saved.

2459
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:30,630
It was just really bad turbulence, chat.

2460
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:34,510
Just incredibly terrible turbulence.

2461
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:35,450
I should have gone faster.

2462
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:41,510
All I'm saying is the plane was not on fire.

2463
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,210
We got saved.

2464
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:45,690
Okay, we're gonna reach it.

2465
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:46,550
We still have three...

2466
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:48,170
Alright, we gotta go up though.

2467
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:49,690
We're gonna go all the way up.

2468
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,270
We gotta go up.

2469
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:52,010
We're gonna hit like what?

2470
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:52,490
30k?

2471
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:54,750
Look, we have engines now!

2472
01:43:55,150 --> 01:43:57,710
I don't know what I turned off.

2473
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:00,950
Agent, thank you for the super chat.

2474
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:01,630
Thank you, thank you.

2475
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:03,490
We're gonna have to relive this for...

2476
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:04,270
No, we're fine!

2477
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:08,110
Doki Airlines knows exactly what she's doing.

2478
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:10,970
No refunds.

2479
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:11,610
You already paid.

2480
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:14,530
There's no refunds on this flight, chat.

2481
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:15,970
Okay, here we go.

2482
01:44:15,990 --> 01:44:17,110
We're just gonna go slowly up.

2483
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:19,070
Slowly higher.

2484
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,310
How do I change the...

2485
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:22,330
Okay, we're gonna go slowly higher, guys.

2486
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:26,790
This plane will not crash when I'm on the pilot seat.

2487
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:29,350
I gotta figure out how to land this plane though.

2488
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:30,750
I skipped that in my...

2489
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:34,230
My teachers felt like I was doing so well that...

2490
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:35,870
Oh, wait, wait.

2491
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:37,010
Can I do a barrel roll right now?

2492
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:38,110
I should be able to, right?

2493
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:39,410
How far am I?

2494
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:43,250
Okay, at 10,000 altitude, I'm gonna try to do the barrel roll.

2495
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:45,190
It should be fine, right?

2496
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,210
At 10,000 altitude?

2497
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:50,190
Guys, it should be fine.

2498
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:53,030
Nice, thank you for the super chat.

2499
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:53,850
Thank you.

2500
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:54,850
Thanks for the nightmare.

2501
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:55,770
We're gonna be okay!

2502
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,290
We're gonna be so healthy!

2503
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:00,310
It'll be so funny!

2504
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:02,770
Okay, we're gonna do it at 10.

2505
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,550
That should be enough altitude.

2506
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:07,830
That should be enough, right?

2507
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:09,930
Right, guys?

2508
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,730
That should be enough.

2509
01:45:12,150 --> 01:45:13,570
Oh, what's that sound?

2510
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:14,750
What's that sound mean?

2511
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:16,050
Oh, oh.

2512
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:16,490
Okay, ready?

2513
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:17,130
Watch this.

2514
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:25,270
Guys, this is a lot slower than I expected.

2515
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:29,670
We're still at 11,000 altitude!

2516
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:36,130
Good day to you too, ma'am!

2517
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:38,830
Oh, oh!

2518
01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:40,890
Oh!

2519
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:42,150
We gotta pull up!

2520
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:42,490
We got 1

2521
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:46,440
,000!

2522
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,920
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up!

2523
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:50,380
Pull up, pull up!

2524
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,260
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay!

2525
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,180
We're okay!

2526
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:55,900
Oh, my God!

2527
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:03,360
I told you we're- I told you 10- Oh, my- I am a fucking prodigy.

2528
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:12,540
Passengers, make sure to fasten your seat belts.

2529
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:18,540
We are going- We're in really, really, really bad turbulence there.

2530
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,760
But it is okay.

2531
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,100
We hope you enjoy your flight.

2532
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,240
And Doki Airlines, thank you!

2533
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,460
Guys, oh, my God!

2534
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,340
That turbulence was fucking crazy, though.

2535
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:36,360
Am I going up?

2536
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,100
I'm going up, right?

2537
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:38,460
Yeah.

2538
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,740
That turbulence was insane.

2539
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:44,160
AirTrap, you fly in Microsoft flights in the future.

2540
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:44,980
Will you do crew flights?

2541
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:45,920
I'd love to, Joe.

2542
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:46,920
Joanne, duh.

2543
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,900
I'll be adhering to VATS and real charts and such.

2544
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:50,600
Thank you for the super chat.

2545
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:51,520
Thank you, thank you!

2546
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,800
There's multiplayer?

2547
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,040
In this game?

2548
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:57,780
What the fuck's the multiplayer do?

2549
01:46:57,860 --> 01:46:58,840
The fucking...

2550
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:01,400
Multiplayer co-capt- Oh, my God!

2551
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:04,080
Does that mean, like, I could accidentally hit another plane?

2552
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:04,900
That's so scary.

2553
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:06,440
Oh, my God.

2554
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:07,620
That's so fucking scary.

2555
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,680
Jesus Christ, it's like PvP, but with planes.

2556
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:15,640
We're not stalling.

2557
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:16,300
We should be fine.

2558
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,480
Why is my engine going down?

2559
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:21,700
Is my engine okay?

2560
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:22,740
Hahaha!

2561
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:26,100
Should I be worried that my engine is going down?

2562
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,720
Should I be worried about that?

2563
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:37,260
Also, like, if I have a co-pilot, I feel like my co-pilot will stop me from...

2564
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,580
will stop me from doing the right thing.

2565
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,600
Because the...

2566
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,340
Hahaha!

2567
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:43,960
Hahaha!

2568
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:44,420
Hahaha!

2569
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,900
Guys, did you see that sick barrel roll that I did, though?

2570
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,900
That's so fucking...

2571
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,940
I still have 341!

2572
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:57,040
That's it!

2573
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:58,500
I'm landing my plane closer!

2574
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,300
There has to be an airport closer.

2575
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:07,960
I still remember this as the day the collective lifespan of all dragoons was reduced by 10 meters.

2576
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,280
Thank you for the six-time thing.

2577
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:13,200
Goodbye.

2578
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,960
Why did I pick somewhere so far away?

2579
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,360
It's so far!

2580
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,600
I only, like, fucking did a hundred fucking meters!

2581
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,040
Hey, agent, thank you for the super chat.

2582
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:30,940
Thank you, thank you.

2583
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:34,220
As an aircraft mechanic, you're not the worst pilot.

2584
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,340
That is, like, a bit concerning, not gonna lie.

2585
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,840
But thank you for the super chat.

2586
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:38,780
Thank you, thank you.

2587
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:43,280
That is, like, just a little bit concerning that I'm not the worst one.

2588
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:44,180
Alright.

2589
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:48,260
Let me, like, make sure you guys don't fasten your seat belts, too.

2590
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,440
Um...

2591
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,280
Where was the seat belt thing?

2592
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:51,960
Here you go.

2593
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,680
Seat belts.

2594
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:54,840
Oh, seat belts already off!

2595
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:55,220
Good.

2596
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:56,800
That's good to know.

2597
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,600
That's good to know.

2598
01:48:57,620 --> 01:48:58,760
I already thought about your safety.

2599
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:01,260
What do all these buttons do?

2600
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:03,340
So, what do these buttons do?

2601
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:03,640
Oh, no.

2602
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,440
Go back up.

2603
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:06,460
Need a throttle.

2604
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:07,860
Okay.

2605
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,400
I'm gonna keep going.

2606
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,000
Just a little.

2607
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,600
Wait, 15k altitude?

2608
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,680
That's not...

2609
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,000
Oh, but what if...

2610
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,780
Okay, I'm gonna drive lower.

2611
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,060
I think it'll be so funny.

2612
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,840
If I drive, like...

2613
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,700
What is, like, the lowest that I can go, like, altitude-wise?

2614
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,440
Like, 10k?

2615
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:29,660
Or 5k?

2616
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:38,600
What's the lowest?

2617
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,700
Oh, be immersive!

2618
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,100
Above the ground.

2619
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:44,600
Okay.

2620
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,360
Does that affect my speed?

2621
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,300
It's not like it's gonna affect my speed anyway.

2622
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:51,840
I still have, like, 330.

2623
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:53,500
It's so far.

2624
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,100
It's so...

2625
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:00,580
Pay for altitude.

2626
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,140
Sorry, guys.

2627
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,240
You cheapen out.

2628
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:07,500
Doki Airlines, you guys... you guys cheapen out on the tickets.

2629
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,320
Oh, my God.

2630
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:12,000
Okay, we're landing our plane on fucking Peter Lee Airfield.

2631
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,040
This is way too far.

2632
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:14,440
Alright.

2633
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:15,040
Fine!

2634
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:15,900
Fine!

2635
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,280
We'll go to the air...

2636
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,440
We'll go to this airline.

2637
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,340
We'll go to your original destination.

2638
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:26,260
Oh, lower... the higher altitude, the faster?

2639
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,360
Guys, you should have said that in the first place.

2640
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,340
Then I'll go higher.

2641
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,500
There you go.

2642
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:36,620
Alright, we're gonna go to...

2643
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:38,160
Guys, you tell me that earlier!

2644
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:40,240
If I knew that earlier...

2645
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:41,820
Incorrect high altitude.

2646
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,440
How do I reset that?

2647
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:46,140
Am I... am I okay?

2648
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,300
I'm fine!

2649
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,680
Don't answer that.

2650
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,220
Alright, we're going to Space.

2651
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:58,440
We're going to the Moon.

2652
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:02,800
Hello, passengers.

2653
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,700
There has been a...

2654
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:09,220
There has been a correction regarding our flight path.

2655
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:11,020
We are now going to the Moon.

2656
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:11,820
Thank you.

2657
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:14,760
And we hope you enjoy your time at Doki Airlines.

2658
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:17,160
Alright, now they'll know.

2659
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,300
Oh, what's that sound?

2660
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,280
I don't like it when I don't know what the sound is.

2661
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,820
No, we missed... No, our airport's still there!

2662
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:26,200
We just need to go higher!

2663
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:30,260
To the moon we go!

2664
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,940
Doki, you need an altitude adjustment.

2665
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,160
What does that even mean?

2666
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,380
Thank you, Little Super Chat.

2667
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,460
Thank you, thank you.

2668
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:37,920
Black.

2669
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:39,720
Alright.

2670
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,060
I wonder, let me go higher.

2671
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:42,880
Oh, I don't like that sound.

2672
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:44,200
Alright.

2673
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:47,300
You're in the airliner?

2674
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:48,200
Enter price!

2675
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,000
Thank you, Little Super Chat.

2676
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:49,720
Thank you, thank you.

2677
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:53,820
Yes, I'm in the airliner, but it's important because I have passengers on my plane.

2678
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,560
Um, those are slow.

2679
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,200
Flight airplanes are fast fly.

2680
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,400
Also, do you ever put the landing gear up?

2681
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:07,780
That is a really good question.

2682
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,960
We should change our POV to...

2683
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,100
You know, guys, I'm actually curious.

2684
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,500
Did I?

2685
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,320
How do I check?

2686
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:29,920
Guys, how do I...

2687
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:39,860
Guys, where do I check regarding, like, my POV?

2688
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:42,480
Is it the camera?

2689
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:45,820
How do I change my POV, chat?

2690
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,720
Guys, how do I change the POV?

2691
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,180
That's a very... Is it the camera?

2692
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:01,820
Okay.

2693
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:02,420
External.

2694
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:03,920
Alright, let's check.

2695
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:07,240
No, see!

2696
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:07,780
Look!

2697
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,320
I did it!

2698
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:10,960
I know what I'm doing.

2699
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:14,820
Guys, I know exactly what I'm doing.

2700
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,480
Alright, let's just look up from here.

2701
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:17,860
There we go.

2702
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:18,860
Whoa!

2703
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,500
The turbulence is hitting hard.

2704
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:28,760
Look at that.

2705
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:29,780
Whoa!

2706
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:33,300
Guys, sorry about the turbulence, guys.

2707
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,300
Alright, nice.

2708
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:38,080
We should be fine.

2709
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,020
Whoa!

2710
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:44,040
We need to go up the altitude.

2711
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:46,740
We're still, like... We're at 18K right now.

2712
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:50,400
Can I, like, make sure our engine is higher?

2713
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,540
There we go.

2714
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:53,500
We gotta go at least 30K, right?

2715
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:55,100
30K is the...

2716
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:58,080
I can still see the city, though.

2717
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:00,260
I'm gonna make sure we don't see the city.

2718
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,000
Okay.

2719
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,580
Don't worry.

2720
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,480
I'm at full speed now.

2721
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:05,960
Alright.

2722
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:07,700
What's the best 30K, right?

2723
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:09,300
Alright, we're at 20K.

2724
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:11,080
Up we go!

2725
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:13,100
Oh my gosh.

2726
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:19,620
It's a party up here!

2727
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,300
Don't worry.

2728
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:27,900
It's fine.

2729
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:29,040
It's not stalling.

2730
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:29,720
At all.

2731
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:33,160
Alright, 20K is good.

2732
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:34,360
It can be higher, right?

2733
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,660
My lunch!

2734
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:37,480
Guys, I'm sorry.

2735
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:37,680
We're late.

2736
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:41,240
We're experiencing some really, really, really bad turbulence.

2737
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,500
Are the engines supposed to be near red?

2738
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:45,740
Yeah.

2739
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,320
We wanna be faster and higher.

2740
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,760
35K is the norm?

2741
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:51,660
Okay, we're gonna go up.

2742
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:52,700
To the moon we go.

2743
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,000
We go higher.

2744
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:57,040
I wanted to get up.

2745
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,740
Jokey for spooky ride.

2746
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:04,460
Look, we're going faster!

2747
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:07,400
We're going higher!

2748
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,000
We're at 23K!

2749
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:09,980
Let's go!

2750
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,780
I think we can go higher.

2751
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:14,820
I think we can go higher.

2752
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,300
We're going even higher.

2753
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:18,920
Full speed engine.

2754
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,040
We have so much fuel!

2755
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,000
We're still only at 50% fuel!

2756
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:23,440
24K.

2757
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:27,520
Oh my god, we're gonna be so high up now.

2758
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:29,180
30K.

2759
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:30,260
We're gonna go to space.

2760
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:31,840
Can we actually go to space?

2761
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,640
What happens if we go to like 40?

2762
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,100
How many altitude is space?

2763
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,920
Many thank you for the super chat.

2764
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:43,820
Thank you, thank you.

2765
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:44,920
Oh, incorrect.

2766
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:48,240
Oh my gosh, what do you mean incorrect?

2767
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:51,460
Incorrect high altitude altitude.

2768
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:54,880
Oh, oh, I don't like that.

2769
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:55,900
Okay, here we go.

2770
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:56,200
Don't worry.

2771
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:56,940
I like it still.

2772
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:58,240
We're still gonna go up.

2773
01:55:59,500 --> 01:55:59,860
Okay.

2774
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:01,660
We still need to go up guys.

2775
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:02,800
We're not there yet.

2776
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:04,480
Space is 100.

2777
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:05,800
Oh my, can I reach 100?

2778
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:06,840
Is that possible?

2779
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:09,760
Is that possible?

2780
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:14,320
Gary, thank you for the super chat.

2781
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:15,060
Thank you, thank you.

2782
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:18,500
As someone who just recently been on a flight for the first time, is now obsessed with planes.

2783
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:19,120
I love this.

2784
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,200
You wish you had a pilot like me, right?

2785
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:22,040
Thank you.

2786
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:25,220
It's only dropped down like 10 since...

2787
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:27,340
Oh my, I thought you said the higher we go.

2788
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:29,840
The higher we go.

2789
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,140
The faster we get.

2790
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,800
I feel like...

2791
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,180
I feel like we're still like super fucking slow.

2792
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:40,200
45 Ks on max.

2793
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,520
Fucking cowards.

2794
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:44,480
Actual cowards.

2795
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,420
Oh my God.

2796
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,820
We are like 290 now.

2797
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:51,860
This is gonna take fucking forever.

2798
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:55,080
Who told me to fly to Belgium?

2799
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:55,340
Belgium!

2800
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:00,040
Who the fuck told me to do that?

2801
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,760
Oh my God.

2802
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:10,200
I'm just gonna go higher still.

2803
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,660
We're gonna go up.

2804
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:13,140
Higher.

2805
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,020
Higher.

2806
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:14,740
Higher.

2807
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:16,160
We're gonna go all the way to 30.

2808
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:17,720
And then...

2809
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:21,340
We're gonna go all the way to 30 and then we go back in the cockpit.

2810
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,460
How am I not moving?

2811
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,500
Is it because like...

2812
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:24,880
Oh I...

2813
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:25,580
Woah.

2814
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:28,720
So all the luggage is on the tail now?

2815
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:34,500
Alright, there we go.

2816
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:35,860
There we go.

2817
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:36,540
That should be good.

2818
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:40,660
We should be good now, right?

2819
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:41,960
Now that we're at 30?

2820
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:43,840
Yeah, alright.

2821
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,240
We can change the camera now.

2822
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:46,860
Alright, camera.

2823
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:48,920
Cockpit.

2824
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:49,700
There we go.

2825
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:50,660
Nice.

2826
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:51,300
We did it.

2827
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:53,600
Yeah, we fucking did it.

2828
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,220
Look at us go.

2829
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,740
We're so good at this whole plane thing.

2830
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,900
Good thing the passengers didn't...

2831
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:05,440
didn't put on their seat belts.

2832
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:07,000
Alright, that's it.

2833
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:07,800
I'm fucking...

2834
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:08,720
Alright.

2835
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:10,240
That's fucking it.

2836
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:11,600
How do I turn on autopilot?

2837
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:16,370
Is this it?

2838
01:58:16,530 --> 01:58:17,330
Can I turn it on?

2839
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:22,850
Why is whenever I turn on autopilot it just goes to the right?

2840
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:26,590
Why did I do that?

2841
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:27,570
Every time...

2842
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:31,190
Every time I turn on autopilot it flies to the right.

2843
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:32,870
No, it's not.

2844
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:34,350
I'm fucking putting it on.

2845
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:38,470
I don't like that.

2846
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:39,390
We have to...

2847
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:40,970
We have to go here.

2848
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:46,170
I have to program the autopilot?

2849
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:51,470
Then what's the point of having autopilot if I have to program it myself?

2850
01:58:52,010 --> 01:58:55,850
What's the point of having AI if I still have to do my own job?

2851
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:57,150
Like...

2852
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:58,290
Oh, hey, is that the landing gear?

2853
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:01,030
Oh, okay.

2854
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:01,910
We figured it out.

2855
01:59:02,630 --> 01:59:03,690
We figured it out.

2856
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:05,110
We know where the landing gear is.

2857
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:06,390
Alright.

2858
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:13,870
Guys, there is a chance that this pilot might just land in the ocean.

2859
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:20,270
There is...

2860
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:22,450
There is a slight possibility.

2861
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:31,190
There is a very...

2862
01:59:31,190 --> 01:59:43,010
Judging by how far left we have, there is a great possibility that she is gonna land in the ocean because she does not have enough time before her meeting on YouTube.

2863
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:44,430
Just a little bit.

2864
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:45,250
Just a little possibility.

2865
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:52,370
Just a little possibility.

2866
01:59:52,710 --> 01:59:54,010
We're not sure yet.

2867
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:54,810
We're not...

2868
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:56,490
We're not sure yet.

2869
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:57,230
But like...

2870
01:59:57,230 --> 02:00:02,310
Judging by how fast we're going, which is not as fast as I would have liked...

2871
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:04,070
Uh...

2872
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:08,190
We'll be fine.

2873
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:09,690
I'll have my landing gear on.

2874
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:13,430
Mr. YouTube is waiting right now and like I'm gonna put my la...

2875
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,830
Don't worry.

2876
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:15,550
Where's the landing gear?

2877
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:16,090
I saw it.

2878
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:16,690
Here.

2879
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,790
There you go.

2880
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:21,390
Landing gear is on.

2881
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:23,110
Uh...

2882
02:00:25,650 --> 02:00:26,510
Selected altitude.

2883
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:27,210
I'm gonna go to the next one.

2884
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:30,270
Can I get it higher?

2885
02:00:33,290 --> 02:00:33,770
Okay.

2886
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:36,550
Oh!

2887
02:00:36,690 --> 02:00:37,930
Is this my autopilot?

2888
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:39,110
Oh my god!

2889
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:40,270
It's 50,000 feet.

2890
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:41,430
That's my selected altitude.

2891
02:00:42,050 --> 02:00:42,790
What is this?

2892
02:00:42,830 --> 02:00:43,710
Vertical speed?

2893
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:45,250
Okay.

2894
02:00:45,330 --> 02:00:46,190
And then...

2895
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:47,910
Are we in the water now?

2896
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:49,010
Is that the water?

2897
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:51,590
This has to be the water.

2898
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:52,010
It's blue.

2899
02:00:53,130 --> 02:00:54,690
Oh, this is not the water.

2900
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:55,650
Hahaha!

2901
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:56,570
Hahaha!

2902
02:00:56,970 --> 02:00:57,190
Hahaha!

2903
02:00:59,870 --> 02:01:00,530
Let's see.

2904
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:01,090
Oh, okay.

2905
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:06,270
So this is speed, uh, caution.

2906
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:09,670
I'm gonna turn off the caution so I don't see it.

2907
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:11,030
Uh...

2908
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:12,810
If anything bad is going on.

2909
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:16,790
I won't be able to know if anything's bad going on, which would be great for me.

2910
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:18,890
And then...

2911
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:20,350
Uh...

2912
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:21,230
Oh yeah!

2913
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:22,450
We're definitely...

2914
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:22,890
Uh...

2915
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:26,030
Guys!

2916
02:01:26,370 --> 02:01:27,190
There is a podcast.

2917
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:29,270
There is a possibility that I'm gonna land right here.

2918
02:01:29,390 --> 02:01:32,490
There is a huge possibility but before that.

2919
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:33,070
Okay.

2920
02:01:33,770 --> 02:01:34,270
Pilot.

2921
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:36,690
Before that.

2922
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:38,630
I gotta make sure...

2923
02:01:38,630 --> 02:01:39,510
Uh...

2924
02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:42,470
I'm gonna make sure to warn you guys first.

2925
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:43,150
Alright.

2926
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:43,830
Give me a sec.

2927
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:46,670
Uh.....

2928
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:47,210
Hahaha!

2929
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:50,390
Don't worry.

2930
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:51,730
Don't worry.

2931
02:01:51,910 --> 02:01:52,810
Give me a sec, guys.

2932
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:56,970
I need to make sure that we are...

2933
02:01:56,970 --> 02:01:58,530
Alright, we know that we are landing.

2934
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:00,470
Where is the...

2935
02:02:01,210 --> 02:02:03,050
Where is the landing script here?

2936
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:07,830
Where the fuck is the landing script?

2937
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:09,150
Safety briefing.

2938
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:10,530
Captain's announcement.

2939
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:12,070
I don't need safety.

2940
02:02:12,130 --> 02:02:13,430
We're so safe already!

2941
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:15,390
We're so safe!

2942
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:17,210
Why do I need safe?

2943
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:18,750
Okay, flight...

2944
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:22,150
Flight landing pilot script.

2945
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:23,470
Alright.

2946
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:23,690
Alright.

2947
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:27,170
Sample radio calls.

2948
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:28,250
Departing.

2949
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:29,470
I don't need to know departing.

2950
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:30,710
I need to know like landing.

2951
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:36,810
Guys, we might be slowly going down, but it'll be okay.

2952
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:38,990
It'll be okay.

2953
02:02:39,070 --> 02:02:40,070
Guys, it'll be okay.

2954
02:02:40,110 --> 02:02:41,530
We're slightly going down.

2955
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:42,810
Okay, here we go.

2956
02:02:43,770 --> 02:02:44,530
Alright, I'm ready.

2957
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:45,750
I'm ready chat.

2958
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:48,170
Look, see?

2959
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:48,910
Everything's fine!

2960
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:52,090
Everything's fine!

2961
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:53,450
Why are you guys freaking out?

2962
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:53,970
Why are you freaking out?

2963
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:56,790
Our landing gear is on!

2964
02:02:57,730 --> 02:02:59,670
Let me grab the camera.

2965
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:02,010
Okay, external.

2966
02:03:02,530 --> 02:03:03,750
Is my landing gear on?

2967
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:04,610
There we go.

2968
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:04,910
It is.

2969
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:05,250
Okay.

2970
02:03:05,470 --> 02:03:06,250
It is.

2971
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:06,690
Alright.

2972
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:08,550
Alright, chat.

2973
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:18,010
We're fine!

2974
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:20,070
Why are y'all so scared?

2975
02:03:20,290 --> 02:03:21,570
I don't understand.

2976
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:25,630
Why are you guys all so scared?

2977
02:03:27,790 --> 02:03:29,590
We're so alright.

2978
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:30,850
We're so fine.

2979
02:03:39,390 --> 02:03:40,150
Hello.

2980
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:49,300
This is your captain speaking, Do mejoresaan...

2981
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,160
This

2982
02:03:56,370 --> 02:03:57,610
is your captain speaking, Do kehuj Philippines.

2983
02:03:57,610 --> 02:03:58,650
Please ignore that.

2984
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:00,370
Please ignore that.

2985
02:04:00,370 --> 02:04:02,950
To all the passengers who have heard that, please ignore that.

2986
02:04:03,150 --> 02:04:05,450
We are doing okay right now.

2987
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:12,910
We are already starting our descent procedure into the ocean.

2988
02:04:13,110 --> 02:04:16,770
We expect to land in 10 minutes.

2989
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:24,790
If you want to adjust your watch, it is now 10pm in the ocean now.

2990
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:28,350
The weather in the ocean is quite nice.

2991
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:33,070
It is maybe like 3 degrees in the ocean.

2992
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:36,650
So make sure you have your life jacket on.

2993
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:40,050
We wish you a pleasant stay in the ocean.

2994
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:42,190
And we hope to see you again very soon.

2995
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:46,990
On behalf of our crew, thank you for choosing Doki Airlines as your airline today.

2996
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:48,750
Thank you!

2997
02:04:48,950 --> 02:04:49,530
Alright guys!

2998
02:04:51,590 --> 02:04:52,810
I think that went well.

2999
02:04:53,090 --> 02:04:53,650
Chat?

3000
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:54,770
I think so.

3001
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:55,650
I think that went really well.

3002
02:04:55,850 --> 02:04:56,650
Alright, let's go down.

3003
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,890
Let's go down.

3004
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:09,540
Alright.

3005
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:10,620
Yeah!

3006
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:16,030
Oh, we are going down down.

3007
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:21,210
Don't worry, we can make this a safe land...

3008
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:22,410
Oh my god!

3009
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:23,630
It is!

3010
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:29,330
To retract... No, no, we are going to have the landing gear of the sea ocean.

3011
02:05:30,210 --> 02:05:31,710
We got to land on the ocean.

3012
02:05:32,110 --> 02:05:33,470
Oh, it's vibrating guys.

3013
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:33,790
Look.

3014
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:40,270
It will be fine.

3015
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:41,730
2000 altitude.

3016
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,310
We are fine.

3017
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:46,070
Look.

3018
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:46,370
See?

3019
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:47,630
Alright.

3020
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:48,790
We are gonna make it.

3021
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:52,230
I think I should be in the cockpit when I land in the ocean.

3022
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:53,190
I don't know what that is like.

3023
02:05:53,890 --> 02:05:54,330
Alright.

3024
02:05:56,170 --> 02:05:56,610
Look.

3025
02:05:56,630 --> 02:05:56,890
See?

3026
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:57,950
Everything is fine.

3027
02:05:58,350 --> 02:05:59,930
I don't know why everybody is so worried.

3028
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:03,710
Alright.

3029
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:05,090
Alright, 1000 altitude.

3030
02:06:07,190 --> 02:06:13,450
900 800 All your passengers!

3031
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:14,510
That's good!

3032
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:15,790
They get to sleep!

3033
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:21,530
800 We're almost there.

3034
02:06:25,390 --> 02:06:28,770
600 500 altitude.

3035
02:06:29,530 --> 02:06:31,250
And we gotta make sure...

3036
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,010
Woooooo!

3037
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:32,770
Woooooo!

3038
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:34,210
Wait, we're going up.

3039
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:36,270
The plane didn't crash.

3040
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:36,710
Look, see?

3041
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:37,510
Everything's fine.

3042
02:06:38,650 --> 02:06:42,210
We gotta make sure we're aligning a bit better with the ocean.

3043
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:44,370
Beyond the water doesn't hurt.

3044
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:46,530
Okay, 100.

3045
02:06:47,870 --> 02:06:48,690
It's okay, guys.

3046
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:49,570
Just a little bumpy.

3047
02:06:49,650 --> 02:06:51,610
The ocean is just a little bumpy, chat.

3048
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:54,770
The o- the water...

3049
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:55,710
Woooooo!

3050
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:57,350
That's okay.

3051
02:06:57,450 --> 02:06:59,170
The ocean is just a little...

3052
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:01,290
AI is cra-

3053
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:06,580
Guys, it's okay.

3054
02:07:06,700 --> 02:07:09,680
The ocean is just being a little bumpy.

3055
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:14,480
We'll be fine.

3056
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:17,680
It's like landing!

3057
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:20,140
We're okay, guys.

3058
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:20,540
See?

3059
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:21,020
Look.

3060
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:23,420
There we go.

3061
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,620
What the fuck does that look like?

3062
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:29,740
Aaaaaaaaah!

3063
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,780
We did it!

3064
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,880
Um...

3065
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:47,920
We forgot to mention to you that Jesus reincarnated into a plane.

3066
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:55,540
Welcome to the Dochi Airlines Jesus experience.

3067
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:57,880
We did it!

3068
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:01,040
We did it guys!

3069
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:04,220
Shut down air... Oh my god!

3070
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:05,480
It's the end of flight!

3071
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:07,520
How do I shut down the aircraft?

3072
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:10,000
How do I shut it down?

3073
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:13,180
How do I turn off my plane?

3074
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:15,820
Can we turn off my plane?

3075
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:17,880
I guess like...

3076
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:20,040
There we go.

3077
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:22,020
Shut down aircraft systems.

3078
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:23,360
How do I turn off my plane?

3079
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:26,080
Was it when I pressed all these buttons earlier?

3080
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:28,140
Flip all the buttons?

3081
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:28,960
Is that it?

3082
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:30,000
Okay.

3083
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:31,940
There we go.

3084
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:33,600
Shut it down.

3085
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,440
Off.

3086
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:34,800
Off.

3087
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:40,420
Off.

3088
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:41,020
Off.

3089
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:41,780
Off.

3090
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:42,460
Off.

3091
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:43,000
Off.

3092
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:43,060
Off.

3093
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,100
There we go.

3094
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:48,960
I always knew the ocean was...

3095
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:49,380
Yeah!

3096
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:50,640
Jesus took the plane!

3097
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:51,740
We did it!

3098
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:53,860
We shut...

3099
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:55,780
The landing gear worked, chat!

3100
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,680
I fucking knew it worked.

3101
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,040
What if I did it?

3102
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:02,840
I knew... I knew I was meant to fly.

3103
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:04,160
Yay!

3104
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:08,720
Look at that!

3105
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:10,260
Total time of flight!

3106
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:12,260
We made it in 45 minutes!

3107
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:14,200
Oh my god.

3108
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:15,660
We actually did it.

3109
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:19,600
Jesus literally took the wheel.

3110
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,620
We fucking did it, chat.

3111
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:25,820
Didn't they get two in one ticket to Doki Airlines?

3112
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:27,140
And Doki Cruise.

3113
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:29,540
Shady, thank you for the magenta super.

3114
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:30,520
Thank you.

3115
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:31,220
Thank you.

3116
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:33,360
We fucking did it, guys!

3117
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:34,840
Oh my god.

3118
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,600
I knew I was meant to drive the plane.

3119
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:39,400
I fucking... Oh my god.

3120
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:39,600
Wait.

3121
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:40,940
Is that a fighter jet?

3122
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:42,200
Okay.

3123
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:42,560
Wait.

3124
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:42,900
Wait.

3125
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:43,360
Wait a minute.

3126
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:44,820
Wait a minute.

3127
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:46,060
Wait a minute.

3128
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:47,660
Is that a fighter jet right there?

3129
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,240
Oh my god.

3130
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:49,120
This is the right flight.

3131
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:49,560
Okay.

3132
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:50,160
We're not...

3133
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:50,700
Wait.

3134
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:51,600
Wait a minute.

3135
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:51,940
Okay.

3136
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:52,940
Wait.

3137
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:55,680
Let me fucking get a closer one.

3138
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:56,520
Okay.

3139
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:57,480
Set as departure.

3140
02:09:58,060 --> 02:09:58,540
Okay.

3141
02:09:58,600 --> 02:09:59,820
We're gonna do a quick fighter jet.

3142
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,640
I think we... I think like we've made it.

3143
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:07,100
I'm gonna... I think we... We definitely made it.

3144
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:12,100
I just wanna know what it's like.

3145
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,920
I just wanna know what is this like.

3146
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:15,360
Okay.

3147
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:17,120
We're gonna turn on the sun again.

3148
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:17,860
Wait.

3149
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:21,800
I can't... I can't... I can't drive the plane.

3150
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:22,700
Wait.

3151
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:23,720
I'm already in the air.

3152
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:25,800
Oh my god.

3153
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:26,360
Bro.

3154
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,340
What the fuck?

3155
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:29,120
There's more buttons?

3156
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:33,100
How is there more buttons than the fucking...

3157
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:40,360
What are all these... How are there more buttons?

3158
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,640
What are these codes?

3159
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:49,480
How do I shoot... shoot the gun?

3160
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:55,030
Where's the shoot part?

3161
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:00,390
Whoa!

3162
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:02,430
Oh my god!

3163
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:05,610
Okay.

3164
02:11:05,610 --> 02:11:07,130
How do I shoot the gun?

3165
02:11:09,970 --> 02:11:12,690
I wanna shoot... The only reason why...

3166
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:12,850
Oh wait.

3167
02:11:12,910 --> 02:11:13,930
Is that the eject button?

3168
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:16,030
Is this eject?

3169
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:17,570
Oh I can't press it.

3170
02:11:18,790 --> 02:11:21,570
A lot of these buttons are inoperable, I think.

3171
02:11:21,970 --> 02:11:22,530
Yeah.

3172
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:24,050
I wonder why.

3173
02:11:25,270 --> 02:11:27,190
I wonder why they're all inoperable.

3174
02:11:30,690 --> 02:11:32,210
This thing will be fine.

3175
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:34,150
Tail hook.

3176
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:36,170
Right engine.

3177
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:36,910
Right battery.

3178
02:11:37,010 --> 02:11:37,050
Oh!

3179
02:11:38,370 --> 02:11:38,890
Okay.

3180
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:40,450
I need to remember not to do that.

3181
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:44,090
The weapons are deactivated?

3182
02:11:44,910 --> 02:11:48,650
What's the point if I can't even fucking shoot the plane?

3183
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:52,270
That's fucking it.

3184
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:54,410
I can't believe it.

3185
02:11:54,450 --> 02:11:56,130
I can't believe there's no point...

3186
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:59,490
There's no ammo on this plane.

3187
02:11:59,730 --> 02:12:01,450
I can't believe it.

3188
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:04,490
Can't fucking believe there's no ammo.

3189
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:06,890
There we go.

3190
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:07,770
Alright.

3191
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:09,230
Alright guys.

3192
02:12:09,630 --> 02:12:12,250
I think cruising up here is the way...

3193
02:12:12,250 --> 02:12:13,370
I can't even eject it!

3194
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:15,210
What does the third person look like?

3195
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:18,330
What does the third person look like?

3196
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:19,850
Okay.

3197
02:12:19,850 --> 02:12:20,210
External.

3198
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:22,050
Oh my god.

3199
02:12:22,090 --> 02:12:24,070
I look so cool but I can't shoot in this plane.

3200
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:26,510
I can't believe I can't shoot in this plane.

3201
02:12:28,650 --> 02:12:29,170
Weeeeeeeeeeeee.

3202
02:12:34,170 --> 02:12:34,690
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

3203
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:39,310
I mean can I land it at least?

3204
02:12:40,150 --> 02:12:41,430
How do I land this?

3205
02:12:41,950 --> 02:12:43,270
How do I land this thing?

3206
02:12:43,650 --> 02:12:44,730
Another ocean!

3207
02:12:45,190 --> 02:12:46,390
Oh my god, Jesus.

3208
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:47,490
Take the wheel again.

3209
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:50,890
Jesus, take the wheel!

3210
02:12:52,190 --> 02:12:52,710
Jesus!

3211
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:55,690
Take the wheel, Jesus!

3212
02:12:57,710 --> 02:12:58,370
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeer.

3213
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:02,090
Ohohohoho!

3214
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:04,270
It's okay, everything's fine.

3215
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:06,350
But I should like slow down.

3216
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:09,610
Everything is okay.

3217
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:13,390
Everything is okay.

3218
02:13:13,670 --> 02:13:16,970
We got me a jet!

3219
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:17,830
See?

3220
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:18,590
Jesus!

3221
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:20,050
We'll be fine!

3222
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:21,170
Take the wheel, Jesus!

3223
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:22,390
Woooo!

3224
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:24,150
It's like a bouncy castle!

3225
02:13:24,150 --> 02:13:24,330
There's the castle.

3226
02:13:25,690 --> 02:13:26,790
Wait, am I...

3227
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:27,710
Okay.

3228
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:30,450
There's like no engine now.

3229
02:13:31,450 --> 02:13:32,250
There's the ocean!

3230
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:33,450
There's the ocean!

3231
02:13:35,930 --> 02:13:37,750
Why the fuck do I land this plane?

3232
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:39,950
Don't worry.

3233
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:42,810
We're gonna land very safe.

3234
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:44,810
Yay!

3235
02:13:47,150 --> 02:13:48,750
Wherever the plane is.

3236
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:50,950
There it is!

3237
02:13:50,990 --> 02:13:51,350
There it is!

3238
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:51,750
There it is!

3239
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:53,470
Airspeed too low.

3240
02:13:53,570 --> 02:13:56,050
Co-pilot, you don't fucking get to decide what I do!

3241
02:13:56,770 --> 02:13:57,850
There we go.

3242
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:00,550
Easy.

3243
02:14:04,570 --> 02:14:06,810
We fucking did it, boys!

3244
02:14:07,130 --> 02:14:07,970
Look at that!

3245
02:14:08,890 --> 02:14:09,790
Here we go.

3246
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:11,610
Jesus plane did it again!

3247
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:16,050
The Jesus plane did it again!

3248
02:14:16,730 --> 02:14:18,390
What can she not do?

3249
02:14:19,490 --> 02:14:19,990
There we go.

3250
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:20,350
See?

3251
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:21,110
Everything's fine.

3252
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:24,330
Everything's fine now, guys.

3253
02:14:24,450 --> 02:14:24,890
Look at that.

3254
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:26,230
Beautiful scenery too.

3255
02:14:26,990 --> 02:14:27,950
Very beautiful.

3256
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:30,630
That's fun!

3257
02:14:31,570 --> 02:14:32,630
That was really fun.

3258
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:41,810
I hope you guys enjoyed Doki Airlines chat.

3259
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:42,710
I hope you guys enjoyed Doki Airlines chat.

3260
02:14:42,710 --> 02:14:43,210
Oh my god.

3261
02:14:43,230 --> 02:14:45,050
I didn't realize there's just...

3262
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:45,430
Oh my god.

3263
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:45,430
I didn't realize there's just...

3264
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:49,990
I'm surprised my PC was able to stat all that on high settings.

3265
02:14:50,150 --> 02:14:50,810
Not gonna lie.

3266
02:14:51,070 --> 02:14:56,070
I was like, really worried because everybody was like, oh, this is gonna PC stress test.

3267
02:14:56,350 --> 02:14:59,830
I was like, what do you mean a PC stress test?

3268
02:15:00,010 --> 02:15:05,510
I don't even have... I didn't even like plug it or take it out of my new PC out of the box yet!

3269
02:15:05,650 --> 02:15:06,810
Because it's so much work.

3270
02:15:06,990 --> 02:15:08,630
It's so much work.

3271
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:10,130
That was really fun!

3272
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:11,690
I really enjoyed it.

3273
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:12,730
That was like...

3274
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:16,630
I can't believe there's like multiplayer for flight simulator.

3275
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:18,610
I can't believe.

3276
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:22,250
I feel like people will really hate me if I'm on the multiplayer.

3277
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:24,150
Because I don't...

3278
02:15:24,870 --> 02:15:25,910
take it seriously.

3279
02:15:26,230 --> 02:15:28,070
I feel like I'm just gonna like...

3280
02:15:28,070 --> 02:15:30,430
I'm just gonna accidentally hit another plane.

3281
02:15:30,690 --> 02:15:32,270
And I'm gonna get yelled at.

3282
02:15:33,110 --> 02:15:35,030
I feel like I'm gonna...

3283
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:38,790
I'm just accidentally gonna hit somebody's plane in the sky.

3284
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:41,050
Because I make my own route.

3285
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:42,670
I don't even follow any route.

3286
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:44,070
I just make my own route.

3287
02:15:44,390 --> 02:15:44,910
I know.

3288
02:15:48,490 --> 02:15:49,530
Also like...

3289
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:50,410
Also like...

3290
02:15:50,410 --> 02:15:54,090
if I have a co-pilot they would definitely not like what I do.

3291
02:15:58,070 --> 02:16:02,490
Anyway guys, in 12 minutes I have to go to the YouTube meeting.

3292
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:05,970
But I hope you guys had a fun time watching today.

3293
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:07,890
That was a really fun game.

3294
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:10,470
I definitely enjoyed how immersive it was.

3295
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:11,690
And pressing all those buttons.

3296
02:16:11,690 --> 02:16:15,790
I still don't know like 80% of the buttons I pressed today.

3297
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:18,110
I still don't know.

3298
02:16:18,250 --> 02:16:22,730
I still don't know 80% of whatever the fuck I pressed today.

3299
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:24,950
But I enjoyed myself.

3300
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:26,370
I enjoyed myself.

3301
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:31,670
Anyway guys, I hope you guys enjoyed Doki Airlines and you would choose our airline again for another flight.

As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3303
02:16:37,430 --> 02:16:41,010
And if you stood up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3304
02:16:41,010 --> 02:16:42,150
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3305
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,370
Bye guys.

3306
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:44,250
Bye!
