1
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,920
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,700
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
So, yes, I am back.

4
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,080
Sorry for like the last stream.

5
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,220
I did say I will end the stream instantly when I beat the level, guys.

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,600
I did say that.

7
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,900
I didn't lie.

8
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,480
When you come to the Dogeybird stream, I never lie.

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,640
Hi.

10
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,220
Look, I was just really happy, okay?

11
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,240
I knew it.

12
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,120
I knew it was the frames.

13
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,740
The moment I unlocked my potential, I first tried it technically.

14
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:34,660
The moment, the moment I was like, my eyes, my eyes was just so used to seeing things at 240 frames that like the moment is past 60 frames.

15
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,080
I just unlocked my hidden potential.

16
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,380
Maybe I'm just secretly a gifted rhythm player.

17
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,840
It just needs to be above 60 frames.

18
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,880
It was the eyes.

19
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,060
I can't see anything below 240 frames, guys.

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,420
I just can't.

21
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,340
I technically first tried it, if you think about it.

22
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,440
Think about it.

23
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,820
I don't remember the second half of that game.

24
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,360
And then I was able to technically first try it, plus one.

25
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,000
I have specialized.

26
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,540
I require the maximum amount of frames for the maximum amount of potential.

27
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,920
That's why, that's why, that's why, that's why I'm the FPSV tumor.

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,960
I told you.

29
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,620
I told you it was frames.

30
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,860
People were like, Doki, you're just coping.

31
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,300
It's not the frames.

32
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,000
I knew it.

33
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,400
This is absolute proof that like, your eyes can see above...

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,460
Every time people are like, um, the human eyes can't see above 30 frames.

35
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,140
This is my proof here.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,320
This is my proof here.

37
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,080
Yes, it can.

38
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,180
I couldn't get past the 054 second mark.

39
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,920
The moment it was above 60, I went past it.

40
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,640
I...

41
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,660
This is my vindication.

42
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,200
I am living proof that eyes can see above 30 frames.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,560
I have become more than human.

44
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,380
I...

45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,840
Anyway, guys.

46
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,260
So today, we are gonna be playing...

47
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,840
I don't even remember the game's name.

48
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,220
I have...

49
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,740
It's called Promise Mascot Agency.

50
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,040
I saw this game...

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,780
Yeah, I overclocked my eyes.

52
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,900
I am the next form of evolution.

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,680
Anyway, as I said, I saw this game on Steam.

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,360
You know, like, it was like, uh, was it like new and trending or whatever?

55
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,220
I was like, oh, what's this?

56
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,020
And, you know, I was looking for new games to play.

57
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,780
Because I like trying on new things, you know.

58
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,600
Um, since I can play whatever the fuck I want.

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,240
And, um...

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,180
And, uh, I saw the reviews.

61
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,340
The reviews for it were...

62
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,280
Was actually, like, incredibly promising.

63
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,660
Uh, so, wait.

64
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Let me read some of the reviews.

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,160
So, people were like, oh, don't judge...

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,900
Don't judge the book by its cover.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,100
Because it was like, you know, the game that...

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,740
I was reading the description of the game.

69
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,740
And it was all, like, incredibly weird.

70
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,700
I was like, okay, a lot of this sounds incredibly weird.

71
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
So, I was like, hmm.

72
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,720
And I read the reviews.

73
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,840
And everyone was like, oh, this is such a good game.

74
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,960
You have to try a...

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,460
Like, the more you play it, the more you'll, like, come to love it.

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
So, I was like, okay.

77
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,400
This seems pretty interesting.

78
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,620
It seems like a really interesting game.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,740
It's like an open world.

80
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,820
It's open world.

81
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,000
And you're trying to start, like...

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,660
It's sort of like starting a YouTuber company.

83
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,420
But instead of starting a YouTuber company, you're making a mascot agency.

84
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,780
And I heard that, like, it is very addictive.

85
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,280
And, like, the story is really, really good.

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,420
And it's only...

87
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,860
Apparently, it's a 15-hour gameplay time.

88
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,820
Which I thought was very surprising for an open world game.

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
But at least that doesn't mean...

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,080
At least I won't be playing it for, like...

91
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,660
For, like, a year.

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,740
Just like Dynasty Warriors.

93
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,500
At least...

94
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,380
So, it's more so you're starting, like, a VTuber company.

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,220
But instead of VTubers, you're starting a mascot company.

96
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,820
So, yeah.

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,400
That's, like, the whole premise of everything.

98
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,540
And I just thought the reviews...

99
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,980
Everybody was glazing the hell out of it in the reviews.

100
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,340
So, I figured I'd give it a try.

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,580
Lord Kurosis, thank you for the super chat.

102
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:13,920
Thank you.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,520
Thank you.

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,660
I am from the next forum of Evolution Shays Doki.

105
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,180
The one that's sick every other week.

106
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,060
Thank you for the super chat.

107
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,480
Thank you.

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:22,940
Thank you.

109
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,660
It is the sacrifices I must make.

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,240
Okay?

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,040
I sacrifice my health for better frames.

112
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,820
And I think it's a good trade.

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,280
I was able to beat the Demoman level.

114
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,680
I just can never go outside or take a vacation outside of my country.

115
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,800
Or I get sick.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
But that's okay.

117
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,900
I can see more than 60 frames.

118
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,560
Solid Snake.

119
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,980
Thank you for the super chat.

120
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,520
Thank you.

121
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,200
Thank you.

122
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,160
Your ending instantly actually worked out for me because...

123
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,940
Because me break from work was finishing.

124
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,780
So, I take this.

125
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,120
Thank you for the super chat.

126
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,520
Thank you.

127
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,140
Thank you.

128
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,780
Eating.

129
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,660
Thank you for the super chat.

130
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:58,980
Thank you.

131
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,380
Thank you.

132
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,900
Pokemon, but for adults who like business and make money.

133
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,220
Thank you for the super chat.

134
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,560
Thank you.

135
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,040
Thank you.

136
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,480
All right.

137
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,560
Let's check this game out.

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,480
Clean.

139
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,000
I mean, they all look the same.

140
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,600
Default.

141
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,340
Default looks...

142
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,480
Oh, wait, there it is.

143
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,140
Okay, there's open dyslexic default.

144
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
I actually like the clean more.

145
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,900
Like, what the fuck is this?

146
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,020
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,920
Like, I can barely read it properly.

148
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,020
High contrast style log.

149
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,300
What's that do?

150
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,080
Style one.

151
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,580
Oh, it's just the color of it.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
Style five.

153
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,640
Off.

154
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,420
Uh, most likely, maybe I do black just for, like, just for people who can't read like me.

155
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,280
Uh, yeah, just do black.

156
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,760
Fuck it.

157
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,100
It's just easier to read.

158
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,820
I don't need a note.

159
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,120
I just make it easier to read for us.

160
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,140
Vintage color.

161
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,940
Prime is intended to play into a vintage camera filter to enhance the nostalgia feel of a Showa-era town in Japan.

162
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,620
You can disable it if you prefer.

163
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,420
What does it look like?

164
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,420
Oh, I didn't know!

165
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,400
I was like, I thought it would show me a preview.

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,520
Okay, um, let me swap it.

167
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,460
I thought, okay.

168
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
Okay, I can fix this.

169
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,040
Um, oh, wait.

170
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,800
Where was it?

171
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,620
Where's the vintage?

172
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh, no.

173
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,780
Oh, no.

174
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,980
Where's the, where's the vintage?

175
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,060
Oh, no.

176
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,960
Oh, no.

177
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,340
How do I turn vintage on?

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,660
Next step on evolution.

179
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,060
Where's, where's the vintage color processing?

180
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,980
Accessibility.

181
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,760
Okay, there we go.

182
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,180
Okay.

183
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,740
Um, all right.

184
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,660
There we go.

185
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,640
I did it!

186
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:43,960
No!

187
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,140
I was like, oh, what does it look like?

188
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,840
I...

189
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,520
Okay, no screen shake, please.

190
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,880
I hate screen shake.

191
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,380
I, I, I honestly think screen shake is, um, makes the game worse.

192
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,340
Uh, all right.

193
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,000
Chaseable animal speed.

194
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,100
Uh, let's see.

195
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,080
Color correction.

196
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,020
Accessibility.

197
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,520
General.

198
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,340
Oh, yeah.

199
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,140
We have to use...

200
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,400
Apparently, if controller is best for this.

201
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,720
Controller is best for this.

202
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,040
All right.

203
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,260
Also, sound guy.

204
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,420
Lower the music and bring the game up a good amount.

205
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,820
All right.

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,340
Don't worry.

207
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,960
I got you.

208
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,260
Okay, I'll bring that up.

209
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,960
Let me know if it's better.

210
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,780
Sound guy.

211
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,140
Uh, silly bird.

212
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,180
And the menu.

213
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,100
Pause fight.

214
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,360
Thank you for the super chat.

215
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,740
Thank you.

216
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,400
Thank you.

217
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

218
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,240
Thank you.

219
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,660
Thank you.

220
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,100
Thank you.

221
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,420
15 hours, but open mode.

222
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,940
So, you'll get lost and take down all of that.

223
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,900
Okay, that does sound like me, though.

224
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,300
Uh, all right.

225
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,160
Graphics.

226
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,840
Is there...

227
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,700
As long as there's no motion blur, I'm fine.

228
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I gotta make sure there's no motion blur, guys.

229
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,020
Borderless frame rate.

230
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,060
You know what that means.

231
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,680
Unlocked potential.

232
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,240
Okay, maybe not.

233
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,860
Maybe not.

234
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,680
120 frames.

235
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,020
Uh, okay.

236
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Get the motion blur off.

237
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,060
Zero.

238
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, my screen's gonna be weird.

239
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,240
Okay, the intercom person heard me say, Yippee.

240
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,520
I, like, answered the phone.

241
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,040
I was like, Yippee.

242
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,800
Let's...

243
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,540
Let's them in.

244
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,080
They might have been like, What the fuck?

245
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,260
Okay, um...

246
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,460
I forgot I'm streaming here.

247
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,280
Um...

248
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,700
All right.

249
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,180
I think everything...

250
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,520
Everything should look good.

251
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:30,920
Uh...

252
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,720
Rush, thank you for the super chat.

253
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:31,980
Thank you.

254
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,500
Thank you.

255
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,800
You forgot the outro earlier.

256
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,340
We're all...

257
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,920
It's okay.

258
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
You can drink after this stream.

259
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,420
After this stream.

260
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,440
Guys, don't worry.

261
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,440
You'll drink after this.

262
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:40,880
All right.

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,600
Promise mascot agency.

264
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,260
This mascot reminds me of that...

265
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,740
What's her?

266
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,260
Cheetan?

267
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,600
The one that's, like, everywhere?

268
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,260
And, like, does, like, the crazy shit?

269
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,180
All right.

270
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,940
I love, uh...

271
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,980
This is a work of fiction.

272
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,120
Yeah.

273
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,960
That mascot reminds me of Cheetan.

274
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,480
If you...

275
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,860
If you say Cheetan three times in the mirror, she'll appear behind you.

276
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,680
Welcome to the world of mascots.

277
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
Mascots are...

278
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,500
We're born from the earth a long time ago and live alongside humans.

279
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,520
We've got everything humans have.

280
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,420
Feelings, problems, questionable biology, and an existential fear of a beyond we can't comprehend.

281
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,600
Some of us also have weird abilities.

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,100
Or...

283
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh, I love exposition dump right here in the menu.

284
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,880
My mom was a fairy mascot and my deadbeat absentee father was a severed finger.

285
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,580
So inherited a little...

286
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,020
Oh, wait.

287
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,880
Is he a toe?

288
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,920
Wait.

289
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,160
That's a fucking toe.

290
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,060
Wait a minute.

291
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I just realized the top part is a fucking nail.

292
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,440
A little bit of sparkly magic and an inner void.

293
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,320
You're about to enjoy a wonderful summer.

294
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,300
In a cursed town.

295
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,180
But first, you need to see what's happening in Japan's underworld.

296
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,620
Okay.

297
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,280
Anti-Yakuza laws are strangling the crown families of Japan.

298
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,560
Okay.

299
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,000
The lions in Kyoshi are struggling to survive at home.

300
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,580
They're plagued by squabbles between subsidiaries on the border of the territory.

301
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,620
Hiroshima's fair...

302
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,380
Oh, I'm getting like a free Japanese lesson right now.

303
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,260
In my mascot game.

304
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,820
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the Hara Federation adapted and now commands a vast business...

305
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,600
Are you guys taking notes?

306
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,760
It's going to be on test later.

307
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,480
Leave in mind small-scale criminal activities.

308
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,140
A deal has been brokered between Kyoshu and Tokyo.

309
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:50,680
By paying a tribute of 12 billion yen, the Nakamura Alliance will ally with the Hara Federation, gaining access to your business contacts and protection from the Fujiwara Syndicate.

310
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,020
I heard like if you work in Japan, you have to like...

311
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,420
If you work in Japan, you have to like...

312
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,300
Legally sign a contract that says you don't work at the Yakuza.

313
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,160
If you want to work like a normal job in a company.

314
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,760
In a matter of hours, the money will change hands and new oaths will be sworn.

315
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,000
The future of every crime family in Japan will be decided on a sweltering summer night in Fukuhara.

316
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,240
Yeah, because you know, that's illegal.

317
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,720
I don't know if you guys know this, but like...

318
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,140
The Yakuza is a criminal organization.

319
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,500
I had to legally tell people that you do not work for the Yakuza.

320
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,540
Wait, it's in Japanese.

321
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,520
I mean, it makes sense.

322
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm in Japan.

323
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,460
You know, it's like how you're playing a game in like France and they're like speaking in English.

324
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,240
And you're like, what is speaking in English?

325
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,220
Wait, that makes sense.

326
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:46,960
No, I'm in Japan.

327
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,300
They should be speaking Japanese.

328
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,920
How dare you?

329
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,040
Why would they speak my language?

330
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,120
Also, let me check in my...

331
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,080
Oh, they put my ice cream outside my door.

332
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,300
Oh no, give me a sec.

333
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,340
I need to get my ice cream.

334
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,180
My ice cream.

335
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,220
Alright, I was like, wait a minute.

336
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,840
This is taking a while.

337
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,720
To like move to my area.

338
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,140
Alright, it's outside my door.

339
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
I got my s'mores.

340
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,560
My ice cream.

341
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,380
Yeah.

342
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:30,840
Alright.

343
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,880
The boss of the Shimazu family.

344
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,900
A brilliant leader who dreams of...

345
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,580
Um...

346
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,080
Of uniting the warren class of Kyushu.

347
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,920
So if anyone can do it, it's her.

348
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,360
Alright.

349
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,480
I locked him out.

350
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,640
It's just ice cream.

351
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,700
I know you can't eat ice cream.

352
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:16,660
I can't change the settings right now.

353
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,880
It'll be after I finish the narration.

354
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,600
Okay, maybe this will put an end to all the infighting the alliance, eh?

355
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,480
We'll get all the family head in line and stop the squabbling.

356
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,320
Alright.

357
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,360
The fifth chairman from the same bloodline.

358
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,200
An aging Yakuza boss who's losing his grip of power.

359
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,760
The scariest Yakuza.

360
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,500
Those who manage to live this long.

361
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,420
I mean, that's true.

362
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,020
Because they haven't been murdered yet.

363
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,740
I want personally thank the lieutenant for conducting the exchange.

364
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,420
Okay.

365
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,300
I know.

366
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,240
Guys.

367
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,940
I sort of don't really want to read too much.

368
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,360
So like, is there an English dub?

369
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,120
There is an English dub to this game, right?

370
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,180
You'll join us at the banquet.

371
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,480
It's because I'm lazy.

372
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:09,980
Okay?

373
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,140
Respectful or...

374
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,180
He's not going to be the leader in the end, right?

375
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,340
So I can be differential.

376
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,640
Thank you for allowing us to represent the strength and grace of the Nakamura Alliance.

377
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,460
The janitor?

378
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:31,800
Wait.

379
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,200
That's not even like...

380
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
It's still respectful.

381
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,940
How was I not respectful?

382
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,480
And the most feared enforcer in all of Kyushu.

383
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,820
His legends precede him.

384
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,060
Don't judge a book by its cover.

385
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,500
Especially if...

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,420
I mean, he looks...

387
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,600
Okay.

388
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,140
He looks like a very scary teacher.

389
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
He actually...

390
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
Kiryu's VA?

391
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
Oh, I was just indifferent.

392
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,440
I mean, I still sounded very respectful to him.

393
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,920
Wait.

394
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,580
Who's the VA of him?

395
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,640
Who's Kiryu?

396
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,180
I hope we can serve you in a manner that makes you happy, sir.

397
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,280
He just looks like a scary gym teacher.

398
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,420
I end up actually...

399
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,340
I end up actually playing Yakuza.

400
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,480
Oh, it's that good man.

401
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,000
It's this one.

402
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,860
You two have quite the reputation.

403
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
The janitor and his proji.

404
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,280
Maybe you'll forge your own legend as well someday, young Tokihira.

405
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,340
Oh my god.

406
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,200
What is it called?

407
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,900
I'm not actually playing Yakuza, but it is Yakuza technically.

408
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,220
Second-hand Yakuza.

409
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,170
I'm just happy to learn from my Oath brother, sir.

410
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,310
The face of modern Yakuza.

411
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,190
Stylish Yakuza.

412
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:10,490
Stylish Yakuza.

413
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,090
Michi's Oath brother and rising star in the Shimazu family.

414
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,110
Oh, modern Yakuza.

415
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,230
Legally destroyed.

416
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,690
What the fuck is that?

417
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,210
The exchange of Tonki.

418
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,010
Is that the...

419
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,650
The penguin?

420
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,070
Oh my god.

421
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,930
This is what he looks like outside of his penguin suit.

422
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,670
He looks like that...

423
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,030
Isn't that like the...

424
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,890
The chain?

425
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,870
The penguin chain?

426
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Um...

427
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,680
Keeping it nice and small.

428
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,360
And Incognito.

429
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,380
Just these two.

430
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,360
They're going early.

431
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,260
All gorgeous-like.

432
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,260
We'll make sure this goes off of a hitch, sir.

433
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,800
Donkey.

434
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,840
He has two...

435
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,180
Wait.

436
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,960
Is that the toe?

437
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,120
Oh my god.

438
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,960
It's the other...

439
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,740
It's the dad.

440
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,960
The absentee father.

441
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
Liz by his coat of honor.

442
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,720
Born without mascot magic or cute looks.

443
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,920
He has to make his life...

444
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,220
His way through life on hard mode.

445
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,960
Shimasu's right hand finger.

446
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,020
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

447
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,960
I'll see you all at the banquet.

448
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,120
So it's like...

449
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,540
We have like our own...

450
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:24,620
Oh.

451
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,920
Arigato gozaimasu.

452
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,680
So it's like...

453
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,940
Each Yakuza family has their own like mascot.

454
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,820
They're like...

455
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,580
It's like their stands.

456
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,120
It's like their Jojo stand.

457
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,780
Hello?

458
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,100
How do I start this game?

459
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,580
Oh, okay.

460
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,060
There you go.

461
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:50,880
Okay.

462
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,200
Let me fix this.

463
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,640
Um...

464
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,380
Audio.

465
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,600
We turn it to 100.

466
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,180
Turn the music down to 20.

467
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,140
And then...

468
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,400
Put the voice up a little bit.

469
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,360
Alright.

470
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,320
I need to know.

471
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,770
Is it actually all...

472
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,660
Okay.

473
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,840
Actually open font options.

474
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,520
I need classic.

475
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,320
I need clean.

476
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,660
I can't...

477
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,460
It's actually all...

478
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,420
In Japanese.

479
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,400
Because...

480
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
I would prefer not to read.

481
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,980
Okay.

482
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,420
I guess it's reading time.

483
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,300
I...

484
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,560
I thought...

485
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:32,940
You know...

486
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,280
I had my ice cream.

487
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,040
And I was like...

488
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,220
Yeah.

489
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,360
I can't wait to eat my ice cream.

490
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,360
And listen.

491
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,980
I gotta read, guys.

492
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,900
It's reading time.

493
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,140
Alright.

494
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,500
Okay.

495
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,640
It's reading time.

496
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,120
The meat point is just up ahead, boss.

497
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,760
Oh, shit.

498
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,140
I played...

499
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,280
Sorry.

500
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm still in the Simpsons hit and run mode right now.

501
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,220
I want to eat my ice cream while I play.

502
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,240
But I have to read.

503
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Act 1.

504
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Dreams of the future.

505
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,440
Oh my god.

506
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,020
There's twins.

507
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,200
There's evil twins.

508
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,520
This Yakuza has everything.

509
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,870
I wish I ordered a mini and not a small.

510
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,750
I can't believe we're meeting the hair of Federation.

511
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,750
You're beating up truck.

512
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,810
What's wrong with him?

513
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,450
Yeah.

514
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,010
We have to be discreet.

515
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,110
We can't let people know we're the Yakuza.

516
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,090
If you say so.

517
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,030
Keep your eyes open.

518
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,430
Something doesn't feel right.

519
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,810
That's right.

520
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,250
I shouldn't be covering up my tattoos.

521
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,010
It's a simple job.

522
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,790
And Don makes sure only we know about it.

523
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,770
Besides the big scary janitors here.

524
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,710
Oh, I'm annoyed.

525
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,070
Yeah.

526
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,170
We gotta teach this young one a lesson.

527
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,370
That's right.

528
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,210
He's gotta respect me.

529
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,450
I'm the senpai here.

530
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,810
Enough chat.

531
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,630
The hair of Federation will be here soon.

532
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,470
Oh, oh my god.

533
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:24,850
Aniki.

534
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,310
Oh.

535
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,970
Oh my god.

536
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,450
Guys, he calls me Aniki.

537
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:32,970
All right.

538
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,110
All is forgiven.

539
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,650
Oh.

540
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,710
You Shimazu little kids?

541
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,610
Cheap shirt and counterfeit watches?

542
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,450
Those look like Fujiwawa syndicate men.

543
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,750
Oh, he wants to leave.

544
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,190
I closed the door on him.

545
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,210
Oh, that's why he's growling.

546
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,850
He's growling at me to open the door for him.

547
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,710
Because I closed the door on him.

548
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,950
He's like, I am telling you to open the door.

549
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,490
I didn't realize that.

550
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,210
Like, in a moment I opened the door, he like went outside.

551
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,110
He wanted to leave.

552
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,650
No, he wanted to leave.

553
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,510
I don't care who they are.

554
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,990
It's time for them to leave.

555
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,470
All right.

556
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,230
Fight me.

557
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,490
You're off the leash.

558
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,830
No rules tonight.

559
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,670
Now, before they draw their guns.

560
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,710
That's right.

561
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,710
We're going to fight.

562
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,610
Show them who's boss.

563
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,210
Freedom.

564
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,430
All right.

565
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,510
Fighting sounds.

566
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,830
These guys are monsters.

567
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,670
This isn't working, bro.

568
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,430
They're too much.

569
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,370
Enough.

570
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,690
Come here, pretty boy.

571
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,570
Just try it.

572
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,310
I think they're actually saying, Oh, no, no, no.

573
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,890
Oh, shit.

574
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,370
He got a gun.

575
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,290
Who brought a gun to a...

576
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:33,750
Oh, my God.

577
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,570
They all got guns.

578
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:34,870
Okay.

579
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,250
Maybe I shouldn't have fought them.

580
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,410
Playtime's over.

581
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,290
Any more noise on YouTube?

582
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,750
And the next bullet is in his head.

583
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,070
Don't listen to the boss.

584
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,850
Kill them.

585
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,570
Protect them.

586
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,510
That's illegal.

587
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,750
In my legal fight.

588
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,210
Okay.

589
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,590
It's all right.

590
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,350
He can...

591
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,270
Like...

592
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,370
Look, he disrespected me.

593
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,410
So, like...

594
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,090
Ah, do I...

595
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,910
He did call me Anaki, though.

596
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:09,730
Okay.

597
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,770
He did call me that.

598
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,570
So, I'll be nice.

599
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,070
Let him go.

600
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,430
Janda isn't so tough after all.

601
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,850
He has feelings.

602
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,470
That's right.

603
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,090
We don't rely on guns.

604
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,690
We use our brooms.

605
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,990
Stop calling me Anaki and I will.

606
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,030
This won't be happening.

607
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,270
I'll get a real nice promotion if I bring this pretty head back to the boss.

608
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,630
Let him go.

609
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,450
We won't stop you from taking the money.

610
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,870
You have my word.

611
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,750
Nani?

612
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,310
Your weakness is family after all.

613
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,590
Pathetic!

614
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,030
Let's kill them both.

615
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,770
Let's kill them both.

616
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,090
Let's kill them both.

617
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:27,510
Let them run back to the mother and tell her that they lost the alliance's money.

618
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,330
It'll be more fun to watch the Shimizu family destroy itself.

619
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,810
Let's go.

620
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,650
No!

621
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,630
No!

622
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,170
My money!

623
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,150
I don't understand.

624
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,110
This is still about mascots, right?

625
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,310
I don't understand.

626
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,030
Why you let them leave, boss?

627
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,670
They destroyed us.

628
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,390
You're right.

629
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,630
I spent 20 plus years raising this boy to be a mass murderer.

630
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,930
Not for him to die right now.

631
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,290
We didn't raise you to get killed by some coward from the Fujiwai syndicate.

632
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,050
You're the future of this family.

633
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,550
That's crap and you know it, boss.

634
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,350
It's actually really hard to raise a good Yakuza soldier to live long enough to be their age.

635
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,150
I'm the one in charge here.

636
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,330
I'll take that fall.

637
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,670
The boss and the rest of the family will need to help.

638
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,630
You need your help to fix this.

639
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,340
The force acting is really good.

640
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,740
I could feel it.

641
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,320
I don't know what they're saying, but I could feel the emotion.

642
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,840
You're my oaf, brother.

643
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,240
We started to protect each other above all else.

644
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,380
Let's get you back home and patched up.

645
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,240
Boss.

646
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,050
Alright.

647
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,410
A short while later.

648
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,630
Sorry, we lost...

649
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,110
Wait, he has abs?

650
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,310
The fuck?

651
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,060
Why are you taking a fall for this?

652
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,520
Oh my god.

653
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,860
That's a ripped-ass finger.

654
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,160
The boss needs...

655
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,660
He's been doing lots of thumb wars.

656
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,980
The boss needs to sacrifice me to protect the rest of you.

657
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,840
It's been a privilege to serve with you, Toki.

658
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,740
Now go, and wait downstairs.

659
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,040
That's an order.

660
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,100
Demo!

661
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,060
What?

662
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,820
That's enough, kiddo.

663
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,900
Get in there, Michi.

664
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,520
Fate's waiting.

665
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,190
Hello.

666
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,690
Oh my god, it's the twins.

667
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,450
This was supposed to be the most important day in the Shimazu family's history.

668
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,050
But you let 12 billion just disappear into the night?

669
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:44,150
I wasn't going to allow someone from the Fujiwara Syndicate to put a bullet in the head of one of our best.

670
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,770
The Nakamura Alliance doesn't care about Tokihira's life.

671
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,630
They care about the money!

672
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:10,750
The hare federation came to the Fukuroka, Fukuroka, Fukuroka, Fukuroka expecting a warm welcome and a banquet.

673
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,250
Instead, they turned up the bloodstains and no money?

674
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,910
It took me a while to say that.

675
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,550
Most likely, dad's hungry right now.

676
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,390
But I need to wait for 30 more minutes.

677
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,390
We got there as early as planned.

678
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,830
Everything was on time.

679
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,070
No one saw us.

680
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,350
The Fujiwara ambushes before the hare federation arrived.

681
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,690
They came armed and shot Tokih.

682
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,250
It was his life or the money.

683
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,710
They never come this far into your territory before.

684
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,990
This was unusual for them.

685
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,050
We weren't ready.

686
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,770
We weren't ready.

687
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,570
The Nakamura Alliance trusted us with their funds and reputation.

688
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,330
And now it's all gone!

689
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,190
They're out for blood.

690
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,070
News has already spread throughout the Nakamura Alliance.

691
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,590
Some families have issued orders to seize our territories as compensation.

692
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:14,890
It will only be a matter of time before the Fujiwara take advantage of our infighting and move on to Kiyoshi.

693
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,410
Thank you.

694
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:15,590
That's right.

695
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,450
That's right.

696
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,270
Go submit.

697
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,210
Thank you for the super chat.

698
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,530
Thank you.

699
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,050
Thank you.

700
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,110
Happy Good Friday, my fellow Canadians.

701
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,910
I understand.

702
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,330
Noe, please.

703
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,570
Pass me your knife.

704
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,130
This ain't the 80s anymore, kid.

705
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,110
I'm missing pinkie ain't gonna fix this.

706
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,010
She doesn't care.

707
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,170
She's like, let me cut the pinkie.

708
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,850
Just above the knuckle.

709
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:53,630
Push down.

710
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:54,510
Hard.

711
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,830
Wait, are we actually cutting my finger?

712
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,190
Oh, shit.

713
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,450
Please accept my sincere apology.

714
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,130
You picked me up off the streets.

715
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,910
I swore an oath to you.

716
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,070
Wait, so he cut off his fingers for no reason?

717
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,310
They don't even care.

718
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,810
It's not me you have to apologize to, Michizen.

719
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,530
Kiyoshi is going to have to fight the Fujiwawa invasion with the support of Tokyo.

720
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,930
Oh, my pinkie's gone.

721
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,510
You see it.

722
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,010
He just... but it was fun for him.

723
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,450
I assumed that this is my last night alive.

724
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,590
Just waiting for the order, uncle.

725
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,230
Her blade.

726
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,070
Oh, my God.

727
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,870
Wait, she doesn't have feet.

728
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,750
Wait, what the fuck?

729
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,970
Wait, I just noticed that.

730
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,010
Look, she's like the... the kingsman lady, girl.

731
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:08,990
Remember that king?

732
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,430
Oh, my God.

733
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,190
She was so cool.

734
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,690
Okay, not her, but that... the kingsman lady.

735
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,010
Where, like, her... like, her feet was just like that.

736
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,630
And, uh, she can, like... she can swap it to poison blades.

737
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,430
That's so cool.

738
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,290
One of Shimazu's adopted daughter.

739
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,050
A blade in the night, a blade in your throat, a blade in everyone you love.

740
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,330
Whatever mother's needs.

741
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,490
Oh, wait, the other one... you can tell...

742
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,550
Guys, guess which one is which, guys.

743
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,490
It's like...

744
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,030
Am I Hikaru or Karu?

745
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,470
Guess which one is which.

746
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,670
Is it the one with no feet or the one with feet?

747
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,510
They look all... they look practically identical.

748
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,030
Mother's dream hangs by a thread now.

749
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,810
We looked up to you, uncle.

750
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,810
One of Shimazu's adopted daughters.

751
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,670
And a future sociopathic genius.

752
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,730
Proficient in fraud, extortion, and geopolitical desivilization.

753
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,590
She sounds like a fun girl.

754
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,230
Um, there's a lot of ways to break a person and she knows...

755
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,950
Oh, I can fix her.

756
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,070
Maybe she can fix me.

757
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,550
I...

758
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,990
This is the end of so much, Michi Zane.

759
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,930
Our way of life is over.

760
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,890
Honestly, I feel like she's gonna fix us, guys.

761
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,880
Sounds like time's up, uncle.

762
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,660
Hold still.

763
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:39,980
Hold still.

764
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,600
Wait, is Tokihira still outside?

765
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:57,040
Nah, he's downstairs waiting to pay his respects to the corpse of this guy.

766
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,700
Good.

767
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,340
No one but us can know about this.

768
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,900
The Shimazu family isn't finished yet.

769
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,460
I have one last job for the janitor.

770
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,820
Oh my god, it's my...

771
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,280
It's my VTuber company!

772
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,820
We have...

773
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,380
Sorry, my V mascot company.

774
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,920
We have one last business that...

775
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,540
Uh, the Nakamura Alliance can't seize.

776
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,180
Yes, they don't know about it.

777
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,200
What company is it?

778
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,480
Good.

779
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,180
Same thing.

780
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,220
A mascot in Disney.

781
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:01,480
You're gonna clean the company up, turn it around, and make us the money we need to keep the knives from our throats.

782
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,360
You sure this is a good idea?

783
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,700
A VTuber company at this day and age?

784
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,000
It will have to be...

785
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,880
Sorry, it's a little bit...

786
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,520
A little bit too relevant.

787
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,540
A mascot agency?

788
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,300
Where is it?

789
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,080
Where is it?

790
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,220
A little bit too real.

791
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,120
Have you ever heard of Kasomachi?

792
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,820
A Yakuza.

793
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,140
It's so trivial...

794
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,620
He's still trying to strike trap...

795
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:58,860
Of course, the town of gods and demons who curse any male Yakuza, who dare to set foot there, granting a slow and painful death.

796
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,680
My knife sounds kinder, mother.

797
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,660
The curse that hangs over that town will train the life from you, giving enough time.

798
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,840
It's a bad way to die.

799
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,480
We'll have to deceive everyone for now to buy some time.

800
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,420
You'll be reborn in the cursed town tomorrow.

801
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,120
Ready to start repaying our debts.

802
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,380
I'm faking my death to become a CEO of a mascot company?

803
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,140
Holy shit, that's hardcore.

804
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,800
Prepare a body bag.

805
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,340
We'll make sure everyone sees a janitor's funeral processions.

806
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,460
Drive him to his grave in his beloved truck.

807
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,300
The time I got reincarnated and became a CEO of a VTuber company.

808
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
This is a second chance, Michi.

809
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,160
If it were anywhere else, they'd be dead by now.

810
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,540
You fell again?

811
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,240
I'll kill you myself.

812
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,180
I'm determined.

813
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,800
Don't worry.

814
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,320
I will make the next VTuber company.

815
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,800
I won't let you down, boss.

816
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,520
Your dream won't die.

817
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,840
I promise.

818
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,960
I am sorry, Michi Zane.

819
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,180
My optimism got the better of me again.

820
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,340
And now you'll die in the cursed town.

821
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,900
Not before I've done what you need me to.

822
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,820
And then she put me in a bo- Oh, look, she put me in a body bag right here.

823
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,000
Aw, they all pay respect to my fake dead body.

824
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
This is your idea of a family?

825
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,140
One mistake and we're fed to the Nakamura Alliance?

826
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,660
I'll never let my talents graduate.

827
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,120
Or else.

828
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,420
Or else.

829
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,240
Toughen up, Toki.

830
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,540
We are Yakuza.

831
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,740
Death is a part of life.

832
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,140
Say your goodbyes to yesterday and do it quickly.

833
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,800
It's a new era.

834
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,760
And we've got work to do.

835
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,480
What will happen to his body?

836
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,300
The cycle continues.

837
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,340
Holy fuck.

838
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,440
Okay, I did not expect this game to be- I thought this was like a cheery mascot agency game.

839
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,460
If I knew, I would not schedule this game this week.

840
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,800
The city will see his corpse.

841
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,560
They will see when we take our transgression seriously.

842
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,680
Michi Zane and the Legend of the Giant will be forgotten.

843
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,080
Will I take over his position?

844
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,040
No, you were there too.

845
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,260
If you didn't need- If he didn't need to babysit you, he wouldn't be dead.

846
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:20,960
Babysit?

847
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,620
Stop being a damn child and get to work!

848
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,660
Yes, boss.

849
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,250
This place really is the town of the dead.

850
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,950
Let's get this body bag to the agency.

851
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,910
We can get the bottle of tea when we get back to civilization.

852
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,470
Oh, that's me, Kroki.

853
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,730
Here I am.

854
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,190
Whoa.

855
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:11,050
Wait, do those like- Oh look, there's like- Oh, take your uncle's body bag?

856
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,050
What is it- What are those, um...

857
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,210
Raccoons called again?

858
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,250
Tanookis, right?

859
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,730
They're- Oh look, you can- They're accurate too.

860
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,370
You know how it's- Wait, is it- Yeah, is that the-

861
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,250
You know the lore about Tanookis, right?

862
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:37,010
You- I just wanted to see if they're accurate.

863
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,390
Okay, no they're not.

864
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,230
This is- They're not.

865
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,590
I thought it was something else.

866
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:43,610
So...

867
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,670
Um...

868
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,190
This is the sensor Tanooki.

869
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,750
So Tanookis are supposed to have-

870
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:57,030
The lore of Tanookis is that they're supposed to have giant balls for some reason.

871
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:58,330
Uh...

872
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,390
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

873
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,250
They're not- They're not accurate Tanooki models.

874
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:10,690
Yeah, they're not raccoons, but they're- I'm like- I'm like thinking about raccoons when I see Tanookis.

875
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:20,270
I have no idea why the lore is like- The- The lore is like that, but- That's all I can remember about Tanookis.

876
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,070
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

877
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,390
I hope it can fly with them- Holy shit, this town loves Tanookis!

878
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,310
Oh my god.

879
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,870
There's a lot of them in this town.

880
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,210
Welcome to the town of the dead Yakuza.

881
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,930
Oh wait, no it does!

882
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,030
Wait, wait- Wait, wait!

883
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,070
Wait!

884
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,610
Wait, what's that?

885
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:43,270
Wait!

886
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:48,730
Wait!

887
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,590
Wait!

888
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,170
Wait a minute!

889
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,250
The spirits came for you!

890
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,810
Wait, there they are!

891
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,050
There, nevermind.

892
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,550
This one was particularly accurate.

893
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,230
Like...

894
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,250
Whoa.

895
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,510
Alright, anyway, let's go.

896
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,530
Let's try... I thought this was a tycoon game.

897
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,990
Look, we're getting there, okay?

898
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,490
We're getting to that part right now.

899
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,010
I just had to look at the Tudukis.

900
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:23,530
Alright.

901
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,970
I'm just driving to get to this new home.

902
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:26,910
Where's my new home?

903
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,290
Oh, Yanhao.

904
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,230
Wait, is that a love hotel?

905
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,270
Hotel promise.

906
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,080
You had to?

907
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,880
Look, I just wanted to see if it was accurate or not.

908
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,960
Welcome to your new hotel.

909
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,880
Your new home, uncle.

910
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,500
Yeah, I was gonna say, that's a love hotel.

911
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,560
If you're recruiting mascots...

912
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,800
What the fuck?

913
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,320
Why am I putting them in love hotels?

914
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,740
Are they gonna fuck the mascots?

915
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,000
What?

916
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,980
Wait, we'll return with further instruction.

917
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,960
Further instruction?

918
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,060
Guys, I don't think I'm making a VTuber agency anymore.

919
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:20,340
What?

920
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,340
I'm making a different kind of agency.

921
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,220
We need money.

922
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,260
The Nakamura Alliance lost a fortune because of you.

923
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,940
You use this agency to pay that money back.

924
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,480
Once you establish a business, we'll come and see you.

925
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:58,320
If you don't earn enough money, mother will be killed by the bosses from the other families.

926
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,860
I understand.

927
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,140
I understand.

928
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,720
Are you guys...

929
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,880
Are you girls walking home?

930
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,900
We're meeting Don outside of town.

931
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,400
Take care, uncle.

932
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,180
Oh my god, it's my Chi-tan!

933
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,200
Pinky-tan!

934
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:25,420
Come on!

935
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,980
Be nice to Pinky.

936
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,860
She's our friend and you'll need our help.

937
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:30,780
Pinky?

938
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,140
Pinky?

939
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,360
I'm the Lutuber manager now.

940
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,500
A cursed town.

941
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,520
Why are we all meeting up outside my love hotel?

942
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,560
I don't... I don't...

943
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,140
Oh my god!

944
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,120
Oh my god!

945
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,280
They have the different...

946
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,380
Why is this mascot operating a love hotel?

947
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,780
A lonely room for one?

948
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,360
Yes.

949
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,540
Just me.

950
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,460
Look, I can love myself.

951
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,620
Don't judge.

952
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,160
That's not what I'm here for.

953
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,460
I need to speak to me and my...

954
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,180
Okay, that's the worst.

955
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,780
Oh my gosh.

956
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,820
Pay up or get out.

957
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,020
The self-service machine is broken.

958
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,640
So just hand me the money.

959
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,080
There's an ATM outside if you need cash.

960
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,980
I'm the new manager of this dump.

961
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,580
You gotta be kidding me.

962
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,640
Wait there.

963
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,020
Nani?

964
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,080
Who is this guy?

965
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,120
Does it sound good already?

966
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,380
Jack is on his shoulder.

967
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,700
Like some kind of...

968
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,850
You think you got what it takes to run a love hotel?

969
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,930
You think this is an easy streeters?

970
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:18,790
Oh my god.

971
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,010
Now I know what she reminds me of.

972
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,990
That show.

973
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,830
The something pop something.

974
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,030
You know the two girls?

975
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,110
Pop Team Epic.

976
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:31,590
Yeah.

977
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,290
Yeah.

978
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:32,550
Yeah.

979
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,130
Now I was like...

980
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,810
This reminds me of Pop Team Epic.

981
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,730
The finger is giving me a middle finger.

982
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,870
You make me sick waltzing in here like you're hot stuff.

983
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,070
I'm not here to take over your love hotel.

984
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,250
I'm not here to take over your love hotel.

985
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,810
Michi is really toying the line with this girl.

986
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,090
Not so thankful.

987
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,310
Thank you for the super chat.

988
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:55,710
Thank you.

989
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,290
Thank you.

990
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:58,410
No, it's a pinky.

991
00:49:58,690 --> 00:49:59,570
The dad's the thumb.

992
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,990
I'm here to run the mascot agency.

993
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,570
And you're standing in my way.

994
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,950
What did you say?

995
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,630
I'm here to do my job.

996
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,790
You can either help me or get out.

997
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,930
Holy shit.

998
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,610
I'll kill you.

999
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,590
Why is Kiryu Kazuma here?

1000
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:33,710
Um, no.

1001
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,290
It's, uh, I'm Michi.

1002
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,560
You're tougher than you look.

1003
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,300
I'm guessing you're not coming after this business solo.

1004
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,440
Who sent you?

1005
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,460
Who did you say your boss is?

1006
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,660
I'll be frustrated at her.

1007
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:07,900
I'm the boss.

1008
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,240
I must not show weakness or submissiveness to her.

1009
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1010
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,080
Thank you.

1011
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:17,700
Thank you.

1012
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,940
Michi needs to tiptoe around this one.

1013
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,900
Obviously.

1014
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,960
I didn't get the chance.

1015
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,780
I didn't get the chance.

1016
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,720
Quit whining.

1017
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,100
Just tell me who should I be expecting next?

1018
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,400
I might do that in the next place.

1019
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,460
Let's treat.

1020
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,920
I don't need this.

1021
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,220
I'm not gonna laugh.

1022
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,340
What?

1023
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,150
I'm not gonna laugh.

1024
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:09,310
I don't wanna laugh.

1025
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:15,660
I'm gonna laugh.

1026
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,760
I've been looking after this place.

1027
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:24,560
Failed mascot looking for... Oh no, she failed... She failed her VTuber career.

1028
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,880
She wants to re-debut.

1029
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,200
She wants to reincarnate and re-debut here.

1030
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,320
Hasomichi Machi hasn't treated her well, but she's ready to make dreams come true.

1031
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,850
Maybe this will be a good day at the office after all.

1032
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,590
I'm going to help her re-debut.

1033
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,290
Don't worry.

1034
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,090
Come on.

1035
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,650
I'll show you around, boss.

1036
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:57,510
I'll turn you from a 1 view to a 10 view.

1037
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,880
Right then, boss.

1038
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,960
What's your name?

1039
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,660
Everyone calls me by my first name.

1040
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,400
Michi.

1041
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,410
Michi as in...

1042
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,190
The janitor?

1043
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,410
So much for lying, Nolo.

1044
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,010
How do you know that name?

1045
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,040
I can't believe a fellow violence-liker is my boss.

1046
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,600
I'm looking forward to learning a lot from you.

1047
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,280
You'll be like the dad this girl never had.

1048
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:01,380
What?

1049
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,420
Oh, she has daddy issues already.

1050
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,660
Oh, this is perfect.

1051
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,920
So what brings someone like you to the town of the dead?

1052
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,940
Is the janitor here to clean things up?

1053
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,860
I made this mistake, and I've been sent here to atone for it.

1054
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,000
What is this uptight?

1055
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,740
What happened?

1056
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,160
I know about your world.

1057
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,440
Give me the deets.

1058
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:10,350
The Nakamura Alliance were going to hand over a huge sum of money to the Hara Federation as an exchange.

1059
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,730
I was supposed to be in charge.

1060
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:30,870
The Fujiwara is going to get ambushed us, and I had to choose between the money and my Oath's brother's life.

1061
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:44,400
You must have really messed up if she sent you to a town with a curse that kills Yakuza, dudes.

1062
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,420
Hang on, did Nui and Yui bring you here?

1063
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,400
How do you know Nui and Yui?

1064
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,260
We go way back.

1065
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,560
We used to hang out here.

1066
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,560
At the Love Hotel?

1067
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,380
That's not where kids should be hanging around at.

1068
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,220
What the fuck?

1069
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,540
What?

1070
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,600
Just chilling at the Love Hotel?

1071
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,220
Why don't I know that?

1072
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,100
I used to come here in secret.

1073
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,320
I don't know why.

1074
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,120
Anyway, we got something in common.

1075
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
Both abandoned.

1076
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,040
Both abandoned the cursed town by Donki.

1077
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,000
Yeah, I can see the thumb.

1078
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,080
Is Donki your father?

1079
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,360
Who would bang a thumb?

1080
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,100
Wait, how are...

1081
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,440
Wait.

1082
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,280
That means they can bang each other?

1083
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,200
I can see the resemblance.

1084
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,520
Matriarch Shimazu took me in.

1085
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,960
And Don was always there to guide me.

1086
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,980
She glad.

1087
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,400
Glad he was a father to someone.

1088
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,640
He took off and abandoned me here years ago.

1089
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,150
My mom was a fairy marshmallow.

1090
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:43,430
I got her eyes and squishy body.

1091
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:46,210
Just got the bad attitude from my dad.

1092
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:48,790
Loyal?

1093
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:52,870
What's...

1094
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:53,750
Apologize...

1095
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,370
Sorry...

1096
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,050
That your dad's fucked up.

1097
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,270
I don't believe that.

1098
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,310
Don has always been good to his family.

1099
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,720
That's the key.

1100
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,040
Why did I grow up fatherless?

1101
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,460
Maybe you were just a bad daughter.

1102
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:25,460
You were just a dumb lady.

1103
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,820
Oh my God.

1104
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,260
Who said that?

1105
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,180
I was like, I mean, look at you.

1106
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,440
Oh my God.

1107
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,340
The dad was ashamed.

1108
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,550
He was like...

1109
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,340
He was like, I thought you looked like your mother.

1110
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,320
Not like me.

1111
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,400
Because he hates how he hates himself.

1112
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:52,620
So he's like, every time I look at you, I'm reminded of myself.

1113
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,580
I can't believe Shimazu sent you to this dump.

1114
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:03,010
How much did you lose anyway?

1115
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,850
12 billion.

1116
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,570
12 billion?

1117
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,770
Are you an idiot?

1118
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,450
I love the voice acting.

1119
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,250
It's so cute.

1120
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:23,530
You can't put a price on family, you say, to a finger that has daddy issues.

1121
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,330
Yada, yada.

1122
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,370
Good grief.

1123
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:37,150
Fine.

1124
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:37,890
Whatever.

1125
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,570
Why does this have to happen to a nice girl like me?

1126
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:43,890
Anyway.

1127
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,410
Down to business.

1128
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:50,190
Oh my god, she's wearing like a little business tag called Pinkie.

1129
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,330
That's cute.

1130
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:00,490
The first stitch is that Mary Meida has forbidden us from doing business on Kiso Machi.

1131
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:02,030
Why?

1132
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,840
I don't know.

1133
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,040
Own messed up, probably.

1134
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,280
He's very uptight.

1135
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,580
Uh, I'm curious.

1136
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,760
I'll be imploring.

1137
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,640
You need to tell me.

1138
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,720
We're working together now.

1139
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,580
Yeah, I shouldn't have threatened a little girl.

1140
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,180
Wait, why did they leave?

1141
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,240
There's only one mascot agency here.

1142
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:40,770
Fine.

1143
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:44,190
He hired a mascot agency for his granddaughter's birthday party.

1144
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:48,170
But all our mascots had left, and so I did it.

1145
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,640
He took my mascot license?

1146
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,080
I know this is a surprise, but I'm not a people person.

1147
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,360
Things happen.

1148
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,660
He refused to...

1149
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,480
What did you do at that child's birthday?

1150
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:21,820
He refused to pay up and rescinded the mascot agency's business license.

1151
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:31,220
Wait, so I have a love hotel license and not a mascot agency license?

1152
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:37,600
Is love hotel licenses that easy to get compared to the mascot agency?

1153
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,220
So that's why this is operating as a love hotel.

1154
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,120
I feel like that'd be harder to operate.

1155
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,680
Sounds like when you see the mayor so you can apologize and go get our license back.

1156
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,760
More importantly...

1157
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,020
Let's talk cash.

1158
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,180
How much you got?

1159
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:02,620
None.

1160
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:03,320
Zero.

1161
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,980
What are you doing?

1162
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:05,840
Where are they?

1163
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,300
Where are they?

1164
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:08,960
Oh, grief.

1165
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,920
The agency account is empty.

1166
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,240
Wait, who's paying the bills?

1167
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,220
So we're bankrupt.

1168
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,240
Who's paying the...

1169
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,340
Who's paying the fucking electricity bills then?

1170
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,500
If Meitra's Chimazu believes in you, I believe in you.

1171
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,640
I've always been a sucker for dreams.

1172
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:44,000
Chimazu's dream, my dream, your dream, the dream of the mascots we're going to employ.

1173
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,980
Let's make some come true!

1174
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,260
Alright.

1175
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,240
We're gonna make some dreams come true, guys.

1176
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,000
We're gonna start your VTuber career.

1177
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,500
Somebody must love pinkies.

1178
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,660
Nice to finally have some wheels!

1179
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,280
I'll take... I'm doing all the driving then?

1180
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,360
Stop complaining!

1181
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,220
Get moving, Point Dexter!

1182
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,820
That's all we need in life.

1183
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,420
A man, his finger in his truck.

1184
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,940
If you're ever unsure about what you should do next, open up the management menu.

1185
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,820
I'm your new hot secretary!

1186
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,120
I'll put your to-do list in there.

1187
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,680
The button prompt for the management menu is on your HUD when you're driving.

1188
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,680
Press that thing!

1189
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,920
By the way, you got a phone on you, right?

1190
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,360
No, I don't like them.

1191
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,900
Why are old men like this?

1192
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,540
Fine.

1193
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,440
I'll handle all the phone calls and messaging people.

1194
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,980
You just look menacing and drive us around!

1195
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,960
Finally, I got a secretary.

1196
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,460
I never have to answer Discord messages again.

1197
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,920
The mayor's over at the town hall!

1198
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,740
Head down the hill and cross the river!

1199
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,380
It's the place with the flags!

1200
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:39,650
Don't worry about it being early in the morning.

1201
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:44,790
That old fool wakes up early, shows his face at town hall, and then drinks in the afternoon.

1202
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:49,710
Alright, it's not that far.

1203
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,990
Now let's go clean up this town!

1204
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:58,370
Okay, I'm finally beginning my redemption arc.

1205
01:04:58,610 --> 01:04:59,610
Okay, how do I get there?

1206
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:00,950
Okay, give me a sec.

1207
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,490
Is there like a map?

1208
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,850
Like, how do I... I guess it's this way?

1209
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:11,390
I assume it's the red, right?

1210
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:11,790
Yeah.

1211
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:12,970
Alright.

1212
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,110
Yay!

1213
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,770
It looks like someone's credit card and...

1214
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,890
A thousand and seven hundred.

1215
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,230
It's just straight down this hill and over the bridge.

1216
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:22,930
Yay!

1217
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:25,310
I'm glad people forgot their wallets.

1218
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,530
The mayor's a crusty old geezer and he hates everyone.

1219
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,310
I can't wait to meet him.

1220
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,610
Alright, it's this way.

1221
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,210
So it's across the bridge.

1222
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,450
I assume I have to go this way, right?

1223
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,810
Wait, can I break through here?

1224
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:39,450
Fuck.

1225
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,090
Okay, I can't.

1226
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:41,010
Whoops, sorry!

1227
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,850
Sorry, Pinky!

1228
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,870
I thought I could smash through the fence.

1229
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,190
I didn't realize that's not allowed.

1230
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,370
I assume that's where the mayor lives.

1231
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,590
With a giant poster of himself?

1232
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,110
Okay, whoops, sorry.

1233
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,510
I thought I was hit and run.

1234
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,410
Yeah, that has to be.

1235
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,690
With a giant poster of himself.

1236
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,610
What happens if I get in a car crash?

1237
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,410
Oh, nothing.

1238
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:09,290
Okay, that's cool.

1239
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:11,790
I'm glad that nobody cares.

1240
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,270
Oh my god, this mayor has pictures.

1241
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,950
Wait, is that where all the money is at?

1242
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,970
Wait, this guy's using our tax...

1243
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:27,030
Our taxpayers' funds to put posters and statues of himself everywhere.

1244
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:30,770
You ready to apologize?

1245
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,250
I guess.

1246
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:38,690
We need this to get the business going again, Pinky.

1247
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:42,990
Yes, mom.

1248
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,590
Don't start that!

1249
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,310
Just throw your pride away!

1250
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,390
We have a dream to achieve!

1251
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:55,950
Whatever.

1252
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:08,650
Do not mention my history, nickname, or matriarch Shimazu.

1253
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,530
We need to keep this as quiet as possible.

1254
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,670
Whatever you say, boss.

1255
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,090
Don't be like that!

1256
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:20,910
Fine.

1257
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:24,170
After you!

1258
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:26,890
Thanks!

1259
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:29,130
She got me Socho!

1260
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,070
Oh my god.

1261
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:33,790
First Anaki and now Socho!

1262
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:34,990
Oh my god!

1263
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,690
You got some nerve showing your face here, Pinky.

1264
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,810
And who the hell is...

1265
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:47,870
She's so easy.

1266
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,510
I am...

1267
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,810
Just the little things make me happy.

1268
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:56,550
Despicable man that has ran Kasomichi into the ground for his own gain.

1269
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,450
Vote for Meida and vote for Misery.

1270
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:01,850
How the fuck did he get nominated?

1271
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:02,690
Oh, Corruption.

1272
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:10,670
I am the new manager of Mascot Agency.

1273
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,530
Didn't even need to finish it.

1274
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:28,870
Pinky isn't the waifu you wanted, but it's the waifu you deserve.

1275
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,830
We've come to apologize for Pinky's previous poor business practices.

1276
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:38,810
And to graciously ask for a Mascot Agency license to be reinstated.

1277
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:40,410
Marisho, thank you for the super chat.

1278
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,210
Thank you, thank you.

1279
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:42,570
You need to throw your pie away.

1280
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,430
Yep, that's a VTuber manager, alright.

1281
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,190
Shogun...

1282
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,570
It looks like...

1283
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,210
He does look like Mere Sanders.

1284
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,630
No chance, this little freak ruined my granddaughter's birthday party.

1285
01:08:58,970 --> 01:08:59,490
Huh?

1286
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:00,930
What did you say?

1287
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,570
Oh my god, he's such a great manager.

1288
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:08,150
That's how my manager talks for me if I'm angry.

1289
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:15,570
If I'm mad, I type up like a really angry response to my manager.

1290
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:18,230
And then he makes it sound nice and polite.

1291
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:21,110
What Pinky meant the same.

1292
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:24,550
Is that we are very sorry for any past inconveniences.

1293
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,550
And want to ensure that they never happen again.

1294
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,780
Hear me now.

1295
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:42,220
I apologize for what happened at your granddaughter's party.

1296
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,320
I shouldn't have said what I said or put the knife where I played it.

1297
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,150
Oh my god, that is such a PR response.

1298
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,130
Unlike the white document.

1299
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:04,630
I am not good at...

1300
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:11,590
I am not good at being a mascot or a company representative.

1301
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:17,650
But with your permission, I'd like to improve and become a better person.

1302
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:25,830
Would you graciously let us conduct business again?

1303
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:37,330
Why?

1304
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,290
It's a worthless business with zero potential.

1305
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,010
Especially with you running things.

1306
01:10:44,150 --> 01:11:14,590
YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG Y Put them in a love hotel.

1307
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,910
You have no hope.

1308
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:23,410
Don't worry.

1309
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,750
I can make them beautiful.

1310
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,710
I can make that one view into a ten view.

1311
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:38,090
Anyway, why is there such a thug in my office?

1312
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:41,590
You're clearly a Yakuza and I can't be seen with the likes of you.

1313
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,650
I have a reputation to uphold.

1314
01:11:53,530 --> 01:12:02,030
Whatever my previous life may have been, I can assure you that I am nothing more than a humble mascot fan and inspiring entrepreneur.

1315
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:15,370
Pinky and I wish to work together to make a profitable bonus that benefits Kasomachi.

1316
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,590
Such prejudice against tattoos.

1317
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:25,410
No, it's just that if you're in the Yakuza, you happen to get like a specific tattoo.

1318
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:28,470
And like it's like easily recognizable too.

1319
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:33,350
So like like Yakuza members have like tattoos that are like you can tell it's you're like you're a Yakuza.

1320
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,090
Next thing, thank you for the super chat.

1321
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:35,850
Thank you, thank you.

1322
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,810
They're my weirdos, tramps and freaks.

1323
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:41,270
Yep, sounds like typical VTuber fans to me.

1324
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,310
Thank you for the super chat next to you.

1325
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:43,850
Thank you.

1326
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,450
Thank you.

1327
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,490
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

1328
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:46,850
Thank you.

1329
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,430
Thank you.

1330
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:48,690
Weedos, tramps, and freaks.

1331
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,730
Yep, that's a VTuber agency.

1332
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:51,630
All right.

1333
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:54,010
Nonsense.

1334
01:12:54,630 --> 01:13:02,450
I'm not letting some thug and a failed mascot run a joke I'm an agency in my town.

1335
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,390
The same brain cell.

1336
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:07,770
You know what?

1337
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,470
They'll only understand threats.

1338
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,550
He's scared of me because I'm part of the Yakuza.

1339
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,990
Let's get to the point.

1340
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,030
I assume that you're looking for a payment from us?

1341
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:34,950
If you're allowed to have a business license, we'll cut you into proceeds after we start receiving work.

1342
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:37,310
See?

1343
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:40,350
I know how a corrupted politician works.

1344
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:45,610
All they care about is money.

1345
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:47,690
I am a surprise...

1346
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,590
I played Schedule 1, guys.

1347
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:54,350
I am surprised a thug and an idiot could be so savvy.

1348
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,270
Here's your license.

1349
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:01,950
It's under Pinky's name.

1350
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:07,470
I can't have any record of me giving a business license to an ex-Yakuza.

1351
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:14,270
Thank you for your support, Mr. Mayor.

1352
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:15,490
Thank you for your support.

1353
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:17,590
Thank you for your support.

1354
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:18,450
Thank you for your support.

1355
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:19,650
I love Pinky.

1356
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,150
Thanks, Your Majesty.

1357
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,050
I love Pinky already.

1358
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:29,830
She is...

1359
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,010
She is prime peak waifu material.

1360
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,170
Are you really gonna give him kickbacks?

1361
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,290
I'll deal with that later.

1362
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:42,810
I'll deal with that later.

1363
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,210
What's important is that...

1364
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,130
We're back in business.

1365
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:48,990
I'm sure he'll come see us, to...

1366
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,390
Come to see us about it.

1367
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,970
What do you mean she's not waifu material?

1368
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,070
Look at her!

1369
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:00,490
I want a fancam of Pinky to tomorrow.

1370
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,650
By the end of tomorrow, guys.

1371
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:03,710
Don't worry.

1372
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:06,330
His thugs are nothing compared to the janitor.

1373
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:15,090
I like her, but she is a pinky.

1374
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,510
You don't deserve her.

1375
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:20,670
Don't call me that here.

1376
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,330
That's my old life.

1377
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,390
Fine, we need to head back to the office.

1378
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,050
I need to do paperwork to reopen the agency.

1379
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:40,910
No one knows we're open for mascot jobs yet.

1380
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:42,310
We need to put the word out!

1381
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:47,090
What about recruiting mascots?

1382
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,190
We'll deal with that after we got the administration out of the way.

1383
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,890
Alright, let's get moving!

1384
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,170
Alright.

1385
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:04,990
Yay!

1386
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:06,870
We got our business license!

1387
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,550
As long as we don't let Banky host birthday parties!

1388
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,190
Alright, let's go home.

1389
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:17,170
And open our business, guys.

1390
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,330
Open our VTuber agency.

1391
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:22,030
And make those dreams come true!

1392
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,590
Alright, we're official now.

1393
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,490
Wait, there's like a comp- Oh, oh, that's nice.

1394
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,970
I can bring out the map here.

1395
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:34,310
What's this?

1396
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,370
Oh, I can change my POV.

1397
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:38,070
I can be like super immersive.

1398
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:40,630
Yeah.

1399
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:41,750
Oh, shit!

1400
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:42,830
What the fuck?

1401
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:44,550
Okay.

1402
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,970
I was not expecting that.

1403
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,070
Wait, what?

1404
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:50,710
Oh, wait!

1405
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:51,410
I can jump?

1406
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:52,470
Jump?

1407
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,590
I can jump too?

1408
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:55,410
Wee!

1409
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:56,270
Wee!

1410
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:56,830
Wee!

1411
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:56,970
Wee!

1412
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:57,050
Wee!

1413
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:57,330
Wee!

1414
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:57,350
Wee!

1415
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,690
Oh my god, my truck jumps!

1416
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:00,810
I have Nitro.

1417
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,200
Okay.

1418
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,420
We're almost back in business.

1419
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,760
Just one last field to enter into the registration site.

1420
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,220
What are we calling this place?

1421
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:31,820
It used to be called Kaiso Machi mascots, but then I changed it to Hotel Promise when things went south.

1422
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,020
Oh, that's good that they won't let me name the company, because I would name it something fucked up.

1423
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:47,960
Then we'll call it Promise Mascot Agency.

1424
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:52,860
We have to fulfill a promise to matriarch Shimazu and the mascot in this town.

1425
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:04,940
I have formed the mysterious masked figures at the Mascot Ranking Association in Tokyo.

1426
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,700
Mysterious masked figures?

1427
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,520
Mysterious masked figures?

1428
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,780
I was gonna name it...

1429
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:25,040
I was just gonna say Black Company.

1430
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,620
I was just gonna be the name of my...

1431
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,680
in my mascot agency.

1432
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:36,690
They're the unknowable, esoteric god beings that run the mascot ranking.

1433
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,300
Continue the cycle.

1434
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,760
And hold our lives in the palms of their onyx hands.

1435
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,380
Watch the top of the screen.

1436
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,220
Do you see that?

1437
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:05,300
I just rebanded the Life Love Hotel social media to Promise Mascot Agency.

1438
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,140
We got some new fans.

1439
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,520
We have new fans already?

1440
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:10,900
Did they hear... did they...

1441
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,340
Oh my gosh, wait, I need to feed Doki.

1442
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,280
What do you want to do?

1443
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,940
I'll be right back.

1444
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,340
I'll be right back.

1445
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:35,780
Alright, I'm back.

1446
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,760
I need to feed my dad.

1447
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:40,280
I need to feed my dad.

1448
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:40,860
Why did Love...

1449
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,220
Yeah, why do I have this...

1450
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,980
Why does a Love Motel have a social media following?

1451
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:00,240
Probably people that married early fantasize of things they could be doing in a town their partner doesn't even know the name of.

1452
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:00,980
Wait, what?

1453
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,260
Are they coming...

1454
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:04,860
Wait, what?

1455
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:11,690
Anyway...

1456
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:18,650
Each time we do something, I post an update and people with nothing better to do share it around.

1457
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:19,870
And we get new fans.

1458
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,510
Wait, are they bots?

1459
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:31,450
Like what do you mean like people share around and we get new fans?

1460
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,250
Like are they...

1461
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:32,870
Are they bots?

1462
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:33,770
Are they real people?

1463
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:36,230
Don't worry.

1464
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,990
I didn't mention your name.

1465
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:40,010
The rest of the world still thinks you're dead.

1466
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:45,970
I can assure you that you're definitely not the face of our online presence.

1467
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,770
We're trying to make this a success.

1468
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:11,650
The amount of fans we have determines our fame level, which determines where we stand in the mascot ranking association's popularity chart.

1469
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,160
The higher our fame level, the more people know that we're serious.

1470
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,920
And more opportunities will open up to us.

1471
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,600
So keep gathering fans by doing good stuff!

1472
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,300
Alright Pinky, start a YouTube channel.

1473
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,800
She can be my manager streamer!

1474
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,440
She can be my manager for my other VTubers!

1475
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,240
And then she can have her own channel!

1476
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,780
We're all ready to go and make some dreams come true.

1477
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,240
And then I can make merch off of her!

1478
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:03,000
And she gets paid the regular salary!

1479
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,880
Of like, a manager!

1480
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,540
And I get to take the entire cut of the VTuber part!

1481
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,360
Of the channel!

1482
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,220
What about your dream?

1483
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,140
Oh my god, she's my P-chan!

1484
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,400
Wait, that's not very appropriate.

1485
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,900
Not been asked that in a while.

1486
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,520
I want to run an agency and become the town mascot!

1487
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,580
Maybe send off some of my rougher edges and bring some joy to this dump!

1488
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,860
What about becoming mayor?

1489
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:54,640
Me?

1490
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:57,400
I don't think I'm cut out for political office!

1491
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:00,740
Devious?

1492
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,060
Wait, I want to know what devious is!

1493
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,800
Don't worry, we'll murder him later!

1494
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:08,500
Ha ha ha!

1495
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,880
Our lives will be easier without mayor and Meida.

1496
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,780
It will be easier to make money!

1497
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:17,920
Oh, look!

1498
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,040
See, Pinky's down!

1499
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,180
I told you!

1500
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,780
She's the wife we deserve!

1501
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,020
You've got a good point!

1502
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,700
Get yourself a waifu that commit murder for you!

1503
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,980
Are we gonna kill Meida and bury his body in the woods?

1504
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,620
She's so real!

1505
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,080
No!

1506
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:40,540
No!

1507
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,840
We'll see if we can improve this town.

1508
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,160
The nice guy wait first!

1509
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,450
I just want you to know that I'm ready!

1510
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,610
She's ride or die!

1511
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:55,930
She's perfect!

1512
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:57,870
For what?

1513
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,650
I'm burying a corpse in the woods!

1514
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,010
I've been putting a body in a car!

1515
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:13,310
And driving up to a brutal spot!

1516
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:15,570
And Grim Silence is really bonding!

1517
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:20,470
No name!

1518
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:21,350
Thank you for the super chat!

1519
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,710
Thank you!

1520
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:22,330
Thank you!

1521
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:24,750
A vote for Doki is a vote for...

1522
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,550
It's a vote for progress!

1523
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:29,290
Just something I've always wanted to do!

1524
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:31,750
I suppose that's number two on the dream list!

1525
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,110
Just keep it in mind!

1526
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:34,870
Thank you for the super chat!

1527
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:35,330
Thank you!

1528
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:35,970
Thank you!

1529
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:37,690
Oh, she's a little freaky!

1530
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:38,750
I like that!

1531
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,770
Feel free to take a look around the agency!

1532
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:44,130
And leave when you're ready!

1533
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:48,390
Actually, I almost forgot!

1534
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:52,030
Let me paint the eyes of this Aruma!

1535
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:53,510
Tradition and all!

1536
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:57,290
Oh!

1537
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,990
Oh!

1538
01:24:59,170 --> 01:24:59,250
Oh yeah!

1539
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:00,270
It's a Japanese tradition!

1540
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:06,530
That's cute!

1541
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:11,130
You're supposed to paint the eyes at the beginning of doing something big!

1542
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:13,430
But nothing big has happened until today!

1543
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:20,590
This is the start of the promised mascot agency then!

1544
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,050
Aw!

1545
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:28,990
No, Pinky!

1546
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,850
The hangnail stays on!

1547
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:31,870
Papa Smurf!

1548
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:32,990
Thank you for the super chat!

1549
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:33,390
Thank you!

1550
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:38,070
I know!

1551
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,290
Welcome to the tomato farm!

1552
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,870
Welcome, welcome!

1553
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:41,930
This feels good!

1554
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,010
Life has some promise now!

1555
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,260
Return to the agency!

1556
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:51,340
Oh, I got 150 new fans!

1557
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,620
Everybody's so curious about my love hotel!

1558
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:57,300
Alright!

1559
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:00,120
Okay, so we don't have anyone to recruit!

1560
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,500
Do we have any jobs?

1561
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,400
Do we have anything?

1562
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:04,340
Jobs?

1563
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,500
You haven't had any offered jobs?

1564
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:08,920
Upgrades!

1565
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,660
Okay, we need to explore to find upgrades!

1566
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,140
Relax!

1567
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,140
I have one room in this love hotel?

1568
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:21,800
Like...

1569
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,180
Oh, maybe like...

1570
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,880
Oh, that's the freaky room!

1571
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,380
Where it's out in the open!

1572
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,320
I see!

1573
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,700
This is the...

1574
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,400
This is the particularly freaky one!

1575
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,160
Um, cause...

1576
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,320
Why is this so dirty?

1577
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,920
Um, Pinky can't really take care of herself!

1578
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,080
Oh, can I like...

1579
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,920
Oh, I can change nail design!

1580
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:47,160
Oh!

1581
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,220
This is like...

1582
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,120
Wait, what is it called?

1583
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,180
Style?

1584
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,040
It's just like Pinky's nail style!

1585
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,180
The foyer room!

1586
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:55,480
Oop!

1587
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,400
What's next?

1588
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,040
My show, thank you for the super chat!

1589
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:08,760
Thank you, thank you!

1590
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:09,440
Wait a second!

1591
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,640
A game set in Japan?

1592
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,980
An intro that takes hours with tons of dialogue?

1593
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,600
Some kind of cute mascot?

1594
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,060
Is this Persona?

1595
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:20,240
I think like this is like Persona and Yakuza mixed in together.

1596
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,420
I somehow accidentally played a Yakuza game.

1597
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,560
After like everything I said about Yakuza.

1598
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,460
We need to get us a mascot!

1599
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:33,520
There's other stuff as well, but most importantly, we need some employees!

1600
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,500
Where did the old agency employees go?

1601
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,980
And then the money dried up!

1602
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:46,280
They all left!

1603
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,860
They always get you.

1604
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,760
There's some mascots in this town though, right?

1605
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:04,320
Oh yeah!

1606
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,560
Some don't know when to quit!

1607
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,200
Others want to stay in their hometown!

1608
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:18,620
Lots of...

1609
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:18,820
Oh yeah!

1610
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:19,840
It's Yakuza light!

1611
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,960
Because it's like only 15 hours!

1612
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,180
Lots of mascots have abilities like...

1613
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:26,240
Turning different colors!

1614
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,080
Levitating!

1615
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,220
Staying calm under pressure!

1616
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:29,980
And so on!

1617
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,000
We don't got none of those in this town!

1618
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:43,480
Well, I can absorb an impact like a mother hecker!

1619
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,100
But no one's breathing fire around these parts!

1620
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,660
So we're gonna make do with...

1621
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,320
With?

1622
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,380
I don't want to say dregs!

1623
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,580
So let's just say misfits that can't get any other work!

1624
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:58,680
Don't worry!

1625
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,940
I'll polish those misfits!

1626
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,240
I'll make the next Kizuna!

1627
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,900
How do we recruit them?

1628
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:21,830
We'll need to find them!

1629
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,610
However, I put that word out online...

1630
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:26,690
So maybe we can sit back...

1631
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,110
Sip cocktails...

1632
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:29,530
And wait for them to come to us!

1633
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,810
Eh?

1634
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:31,750
Eh?

1635
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:35,190
Oh my god!

1636
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:36,210
She sounds so cute!

1637
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:39,830
I'll have a martini!

1638
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,610
Oh my god!

1639
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:43,910
She's so cute!

1640
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:46,870
Oh my god!

1641
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,380
Oh my god!

1642
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,300
I like how...

1643
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,500
Cactus...

1644
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,760
Deleted all the Kizuna...

1645
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,720
When I made the reference to Kizuna!

1646
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,680
Cactus was like...

1647
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,580
Cactus was like...

1648
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,260
Cactus was like...

1649
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:09,840
No talking about Kizuna!

1650
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,140
No!

1651
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,500
I mentioned her first!

1652
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:14,700
Hello!

1653
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:14,980
Hello!

1654
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,020
I'm reaching you!

1655
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,460
I see you no pinky!

1656
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:19,580
Hello!

1657
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,040
Nice to meet you!

1658
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:33,300
Oh my god!

1659
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,920
Tofu is so cute!

1660
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:35,560
Oh my god!

1661
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,040
She's gonna be a star!

1662
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,880
I can see it!

1663
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,980
She's gonna be a fucking star!

1664
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:47,540
Currently soft, but wants to be firm.

1665
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,300
Never stops crying, but that's part of...

1666
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:51,260
Wait, his charm?

1667
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,260
Wait...

1668
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:56,740
Wait...

1669
01:30:56,740 --> 01:31:00,920
Treated badly by punks, but that needs a good kicking?

1670
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,760
Wait...

1671
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,880
If you ask...

1672
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:06,240
Wait...

1673
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:06,520
He?

1674
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,580
I don't know...

1675
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:11,820
Can we help?

1676
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,340
It's so perfect!

1677
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:15,700
It's so perfect!

1678
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,920
We can make it work!

1679
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:20,960
Better!

1680
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,100
I saw online that the...

1681
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,040
Asuka Agency is open again!

1682
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,240
You bet it is!

1683
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,660
You bet it is!

1684
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,720
This here's a new boss!

1685
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,720
I think he's killed people!

1686
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,380
Oh my god!

1687
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,980
She's so cute!

1688
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:45,560
What?

1689
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,080
I love it when he's scared!

1690
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:51,360
Warning!

1691
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,960
This tofu might contain nuts!

1692
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,820
Golem, thank you for the super chat!

1693
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,780
Thank you!

1694
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,560
Golem!

1695
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,160
Pinky is just a bit overexcited about the Agency being open again!

1696
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:08,660
See?

1697
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,640
Pinky, you made our guest cry!

1698
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,520
Don't worry, I love it when they cry!

1699
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,080
They're so cute when they're crying!

1700
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,640
It's okay!

1701
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,780
I'm not crying because of you two!

1702
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,440
I just...

1703
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,980
I can never stop crying!

1704
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:35,990
Tofu and I go way back!

1705
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,490
We used to go to school together!

1706
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:43,310
They're in there so cruel!

1707
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:47,490
Pinky...

1708
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:57,430
Some kids used to give us crap until I found out where they live!

1709
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:02,490
What brings you to see this day, Tofu?

1710
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:13,350
I'm gonna make you a fucking star, Tofu!

1711
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:22,030
I saw that Pinky posted that the Agency was open again!

1712
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:23,670
And well...

1713
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:27,430
My therapist says I need to try new things!

1714
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:28,390
And...

1715
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,800
You've come to the right place!

1716
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,420
You wanna get out of here and meet new people and make them happy, right?

1717
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:44,840
Um...

1718
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,160
I'm not sure...

1719
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,560
I don't know, he's so cute!

1720
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:00,680
So...

1721
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:01,480
Thank you to the super chat!

1722
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,380
Thank you, thank you!

1723
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,420
My name's...

1724
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:04,500
Not Pinky!

1725
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:10,820
If your dream is to make a difference in people's lives and crush old men under your boot, we're here to help!

1726
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:13,500
Wait!

1727
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,640
I'm not sure about...

1728
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,360
Look, we'll give you a salary and a room to stay in!

1729
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:28,160
We can offer more as well!

1730
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,160
Tofu, my new cameoshi!

1731
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:33,700
Hey!

1732
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,180
Wait a minute, Tofu, you're fired!

1733
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,160
No one encroaches in my territory!

1734
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,940
Boss, let me explain how this works!

1735
01:34:54,080 --> 01:35:00,280
What a mascot like Tofu goes out on a job, they take a percentage of the payment for the job as their wage!

1736
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,940
If jobs go well...

1737
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,380
The clan pays more and everyone earns more money!

1738
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:18,760
When you recruit a mascot, you can choose what percentage of the job payment they'll get at the end of the job!

1739
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:27,710
Obviously, they'll be happy with a higher percentage, but the agency will receive less!

1740
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,760
I will watch Tofu!

1741
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:40,960
No matter where they reincarnate, you'll follow Tofu wherever she goes!

1742
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:47,060
You can offer your mascot more perks like tied-off and guaranteed bonus reviews!

1743
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,200
We're employee-centric, so you need to work to make them interested in working for us!

1744
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,440
Now, we got places to be!

1745
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,300
Let's look at the paperwork!

1746
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,220
Alright!

1747
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:07,160
You need to convince- Well, I didn't really do much to convince Tofu!

1748
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:10,920
Each mascot will get a share of your money you receive for every job to complete!

1749
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:13,640
But you should offer them extra perks!

1750
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,520
The more you convince them, the happier you'll be!

1751
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,920
But remember that you can't take the perks away later!

1752
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:18,980
Alright!

1753
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:21,420
Okay!

1754
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,500
Until you complete your non-increasing job share!

1755
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:28,240
Um...

1756
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,160
Every six, negotiate a bonus!

1757
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,480
I'll give you time off!

1758
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,760
Okay, what happens?

1759
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:35,760
Board...

1760
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,500
I'll give you...

1761
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:42,620
Okay, so...

1762
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:45,300
The bonus...

1763
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:45,600
Alright!

1764
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,080
That should be fine!

1765
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:47,900
I'll give...

1766
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:48,600
Actually...

1767
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:50,900
I'll give you a bonus!

1768
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:51,960
And...

1769
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:52,720
Actually...

1770
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,180
Job share...

1771
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:54,700
Can be...

1772
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,520
Can't be set...

1773
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,460
Non-increasing...

1774
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:57,060
What is...

1775
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:59,020
Non-increasing job share can affect stats?

1776
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,580
What does it do?

1777
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,340
What does job share even do?

1778
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,340
It's a bonus a lot?

1779
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,060
Okay, well...

1780
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,300
We'll do 5% then.

1781
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:08,800
There we go.

1782
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:09,800
There we go.

1783
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:10,540
That's enough.

1784
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,320
Time off and...

1785
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,020
5% job share.

1786
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:14,820
Alright!

1787
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,500
Here's my offer, Tofu!

1788
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:27,620
Make offer for 17% payment from jobs to complete plus the selected perks.

1789
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:28,780
Once recruited...

1790
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:30,940
Tofu can be managed from the...

1791
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:31,160
Alright!

1792
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:34,740
Nice!

1793
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:35,040
Look!

1794
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:35,260
See?

1795
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,260
You got 17%!

1796
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,480
That's a lot!

1797
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,060
That...

1798
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,140
Just think about it.

1799
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:41,900
Uh...

1800
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:42,540
Okay...

1801
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,820
It might be a little tight...

1802
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:46,460
But...

1803
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,620
You're doing this as a hobby, Tofu.

1804
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,700
Just remember that.

1805
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:50,720
Like...

1806
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:53,060
You're only doing this to make yourself happier.

1807
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:54,280
And isn't like...

1808
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,980
Being a mascot the happiest thing you can do?

1809
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:57,080
Will?

1810
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,400
Just think about that.

1811
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:00,220
Think.

1812
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,380
And then like...

1813
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:01,700
You know...

1814
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,100
Maybe when we get merch later...

1815
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:03,480
Your...

1816
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,560
Your percentage will increase, Tofu.

1817
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:06,580
Your...

1818
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,100
Please treat him better.

1819
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:15,380
I'm ready to work whenever you want me to send out.

1820
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,100
And think about it.

1821
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,700
You're gonna make so many fans so happy.

1822
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,940
You don't want them to be sad, right?

1823
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:23,940
You wanna make them happy.

1824
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,940
Tofu deserves better.

1825
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,040
Thank you for agreeing to work with us.

1826
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,640
We'll do our best to achieve all of our dreams.

1827
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,560
Head into the industry and make yourself at home.

1828
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,400
Shiori will come and get you when there's a job.

1829
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,060
Shiori?

1830
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,520
Last time I saw, she said she put me in a hotpot!

1831
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,300
Zofu Tajis won't keep our voices down.

1832
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:05,320
How did she...

1833
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,160
How does you already have a fan name?!

1834
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:12,600
I'm sure she meant that affectionately.

1835
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,880
Go and chill out in the office.

1836
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,860
The rotating beds will kick your mind off everything.

1837
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:26,770
Thank you.

1838
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:29,170
Thank you again for this opportunity.

1839
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:29,870
Look, see?

1840
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:31,270
He's grateful.

1841
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:35,070
He's grateful for that 17%.

1842
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,250
Okay, boss.

1843
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:41,590
It's the first day of the rest of our lives.

1844
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:47,450
We recruited our first mascots, so we're almost ready to start sending them out on jobs.

1845
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:55,590
Who is Shiori and why was Tofu scared of her?

1846
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:57,830
My fellow Tofutachis!

1847
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:06,880
She takes the mascot out on jobs and runs the events.

1848
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:12,220
She seems scared because of her temper, but she's cooler than most people in this town.

1849
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,820
Ancho, thank you for the super chat.

1850
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:16,680
Thank you, thank you.

1851
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:19,140
Say firm Tofutachis!

1852
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,820
We will defend our king!

1853
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,220
For she works at a convenience store over the river.

1854
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:32,740
If she works at a convenience store, how can she take mascots on jobs?

1855
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,870
That won't be a problem.

1856
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:38,510
Let's go!

1857
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,880
Head back down the hill into town again.

1858
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:51,300
But at this time, hang a right and go across the blue bridge.

1859
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,980
Remember to head for the red icon on your mini-map.

1860
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,600
And you're not sure where to go.

1861
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:58,460
Okay.

1862
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,000
That seems easy enough.

1863
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,660
Oh my god.

1864
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:02,460
Oh wait, is it there?

1865
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:03,460
That's so far!

1866
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:05,960
Alright, let's go.

1867
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:07,280
I need to go this way.

1868
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:07,300
Okay.

1869
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,500
Alright, we gotta find...

1870
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:12,780
We gotta find...

1871
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:14,480
Find the staff member.

1872
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,800
Alright, can I do a shortcut?

1873
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,060
I think I can, yeah.

1874
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,740
Yay, jump!

1875
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,320
Wait, there's something up here.

1876
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:24,820
Oh, it's just trash.

1877
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:25,920
Woo!

1878
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:29,440
I feel like I'm gonna have to collect trash somewhere.

1879
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:30,580
Later.

1880
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,280
Okay, I assume it's...

1881
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,480
Okay, there's the blue bridge.

1882
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,360
What?

1883
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:40,240
Yeah, I know.

1884
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:41,980
Why didn't you tell me about the map?

1885
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:42,900
I know where I'm going.

1886
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,140
I'm just taking a shortcut.

1887
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:47,640
Woo!

1888
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,760
Alright, I'm here at the market.

1889
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:54,560
Hello!

1890
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:00,530
Hi!

1891
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:01,630
Hey Pinky!

1892
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:04,630
Oh, she's wearing my shirt!

1893
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:05,630
Or are she?

1894
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:08,230
Oh my god, we're already making money on merch.

1895
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,410
Must be Michi, the new boss.

1896
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:19,650
But to me, you...

1897
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:20,650
Word travels fast.

1898
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:24,810
Wait, how does she know?

1899
01:42:25,670 --> 01:42:27,910
Can't believe I'm finally meeting a janitor.

1900
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:30,450
Yeah, how does she know?

1901
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:32,650
I'm supposed to be dead!

1902
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:34,930
Does everyone here know my name?

1903
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:38,190
I'm gonna call people.

1904
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:50,250
Don't worry, boss man.

1905
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:51,650
I'll keep your secret.

1906
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:53,470
I'm tight with you and you.

1907
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:55,510
While I keep this hella quiet.

1908
01:42:58,370 --> 01:43:00,730
Of course, you keep thinking about the super chat.

1909
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:01,750
Thank you, thank you.

1910
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:03,570
Shari is one of our employees.

1911
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:05,270
Well, our only employee.

1912
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:10,690
I used to work for Pinky.

1913
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:13,390
Before she converted the place into a love hotel.

1914
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:16,590
Back when there was a work for mascots.

1915
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:20,660
Alright.

1916
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,880
She'll handle your mascots or die trying.

1917
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,620
Angry at a small town.

1918
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:26,580
Metal as heck.

1919
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:29,220
A human ship missile who could change the world.

1920
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,360
On a money drive up?

1921
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,620
I came to work in the convenience store.

1922
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,420
There's no way I can clean up a love...

1923
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:42,060
Okay, yeah.

1924
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:42,740
Like...

1925
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:45,420
You gotta be paid a lot of money to clean up a love hotel.

1926
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,560
That does not seem like a great job.

1927
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,100
Even like regular hotels is pretty neat.

1928
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:55,900
It's a lot.

1929
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,600
Shari is our mascot handler.

1930
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:07,580
As soon as Pinky messaged me to say the industry was back in business.

1931
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:10,320
I flipped off my manager and walked out.

1932
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,360
I'm ready for work, boss man.

1933
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,160
My destiny is to work with mascots.

1934
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:28,380
Not sell two day old Odin to the creeps in this town.

1935
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,740
So we got lots of work.

1936
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:39,320
Loads of mascots that need my foot up their ass.

1937
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,720
The crusty old mayor just gave us her business license back.

1938
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:53,780
We're just about to speak to some potential clients about some work.

1939
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:01,760
Right on.

1940
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:04,380
I'll go and get some stuff in order and get ready for the call.

1941
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:07,840
Mascot support heroes?

1942
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:08,920
Wait, what is that?

1943
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:10,180
Yeah.

1944
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:17,600
Check it, boss man.

1945
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,640
As well as being a mascot handler.

1946
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,580
I'm a registered mascot support hero.

1947
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,400
Fighting a child?

1948
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:29,540
Vehicular homicide?

1949
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:31,940
What kind of mascots do we have?

1950
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:33,760
Look at that.

1951
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,300
I told you Tofu might be a murderer.

1952
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:44,340
When that happens, you need to send heroes to help them.

1953
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,760
Slend it!

1954
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,800
My Tofu would never!

1955
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:59,800
If you choose to help, you use heroes to give your mascots a boost thing to get through a bad time.

1956
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,520
Hey, you should become heroes as well.

1957
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,640
Okay, I'll be honest.

1958
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,500
I'm supposed to be dead.

1959
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:16,920
That's as honest as I can be.

1960
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,300
I'll do it!

1961
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,440
Right on!

1962
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:29,980
Remember, each hero has different strengths and weaknesses.

1963
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,180
I'm gonna find as many heroes as you can!

1964
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,620
Ask around town and go- Oh my gosh, I'm basically getting handlers right now.

1965
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,520
Ask around town and go searching for more hero cards.

1966
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:44,820
You never know where you might find a card!

1967
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:55,100
Running a mascot agency is stranger than I thought it was going to be.

1968
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,160
Whoa!

1969
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:03,600
Whoa!

1970
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

1971
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,340
What would you do, you goddamn punk?

1972
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:11,240
Your previous job was beating people in debt because they didn't pay a loan back.

1973
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,240
Oh, she's angry, guys.

1974
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,600
I like her now.

1975
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,880
That's really weird if you ask me.

1976
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:28,760
We're just trying to spread some happiness here.

1977
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:29,820
You think that's weird?

1978
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,300
You make me sick!

1979
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,120
Oh, you may have a point.

1980
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,680
Oh, that's alright.

1981
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,340
Okay, you- I understand, ma'am.

1982
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,220
And don't you forget it!

1983
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:56,330
Now that you're ignoring the only person other than me that wants to help you, let's go find some work!

1984
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:04,470
This town is full of people that want to hire a mascot for an event.

1985
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:05,890
We just don't know it yet.

1986
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:10,030
The best bet is the shopping street.

1987
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,450
Oh, okay.

1988
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,330
Let's see who wants to hire Tofu.

1989
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:25,180
Endo is the shopping association chairman.

1990
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:30,500
He's another crusty old geezer, but he'll have work for us.

1991
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,740
His office is in the covered shopping area.

1992
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,040
He's always up early.

1993
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:41,740
His wife gets him up and forces him out of the house.

1994
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:42,620
Let's go.

1995
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:49,970
Show me out when you need me.

1996
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:52,950
I'm gonna go and find some mascots for you to recruit.

1997
01:48:53,330 --> 01:48:53,650
Peace!

1998
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:55,010
Nice, alright.

1999
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:59,050
I'm putting my recruitment out right now for mascots, guys.

2000
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:00,410
Send your application.

2001
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:06,450
I need a five-minute video that will show your personality and what your strengths are.

2002
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:11,710
And you might get past the first stage to the interview stage.

2003
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:14,510
A human-shaped missile who can not find it.

2004
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:15,830
Okay, so that's the upgrade card.

2005
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:17,950
And I got the pinky one.

2006
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:20,250
Uh, alright.

2007
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:26,550
And if you make it past the first stage, then you'll get an email from us at...

2008
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:28,890
Uh, DokiCanRead at...

2009
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:30,530
PromiseMascotAgency.

2010
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:31,450
I went the wrong way.

2011
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:32,230
I...

2012
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:38,450
And then if you're really lucky, you might...

2013
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:41,990
You might get into the second round of interviews.

2014
01:49:43,370 --> 01:49:44,190
Oh, shit.

2015
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,190
Sorry.

2016
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:47,270
I know the road is really big.

2017
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:50,410
But I saw a man just smashed into the other light pole.

2018
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:56,640
Alright.

2019
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:57,280
Oh, that...

2020
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,000
Oh, if I...

2021
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,220
If I do well...

2022
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:01,320
Then, like, the town will open more shops.

2023
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,280
Ah, it's you.

2024
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,760
Doki be like that, Endo.

2025
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,280
Don't be like that.

2026
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,220
I don't say Doki be like that.

2027
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:21,520
Is this someone else you've accepted, Pinky?

2028
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,300
You're damn right.

2029
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:29,460
Oh, sorry, dear.

2030
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:31,440
Some people have come to see me.

2031
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,380
No, I'll be quick.

2032
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,040
Oh, you're still whipped?

2033
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,500
Please, keep your voice down.

2034
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,420
Sorry, dear.

2035
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,620
I was talking to someone.

2036
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,480
Anyway, that last event we hosted to you...

2037
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,380
Was a disaster.

2038
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,480
Hey, that wasn't our fault.

2039
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:04,960
You're the one to try to sift us on payment with a dodgy contract.

2040
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:14,580
Nichi, this is

2041
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:19,280
Endo.

2042
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,760
He runs the shoppers' association in town.

2043
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,740
He tried to scam us on a job.

2044
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:24,780
Anyway, Endo.

2045
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,160
We're back in business.

2046
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,140
What?

2047
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,480
I thought the mayor shut you down.

2048
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,140
Business, business, business.

2049
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,100
Endo's what?

2050
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:35,840
I was like...

2051
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,100
A man that's continued to put upon...

2052
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,480
How is he expected to run a shopping association?

2053
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,440
In a dying town?

2054
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:48,020
How?

2055
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:50,060
Just...

2056
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:51,640
Open an Amazon warehouse.

2057
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:54,380
The mayor agreed to let us reopen.

2058
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:00,720
Speaking of wish, is it true you're planning on reopening all these stores?

2059
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:04,560
Where did you hear that?

2060
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:14,860
What is that?

2061
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:18,180
Word is that you're finally getting some of that Kyoshi Rejuvenation Fund.

2062
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:21,080
And you managed to convince people to reopen the old stores.

2063
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,060
Yeah, what is...

2064
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:23,820
What are the funds?

2065
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:27,200
Some government subsidy.

2066
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:35,250
For dying town like ours to revitalize tourism and industry.

2067
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:39,530
No one has seen a single yen of it until now.

2068
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:49,870
If you're opening stores, mascot events are an excellent way of promoting them.

2069
01:52:52,290 --> 01:52:55,470
I might need mascots, but I definitely don't need yours.

2070
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:01,010
Sorry, dear.

2071
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:02,030
I'll be done soon.

2072
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:17,130
The mascot agency is under new management.

2073
01:53:17,570 --> 01:53:18,970
We're doing things differently now.

2074
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:21,630
Pinky is taking less of a customer-facing role.

2075
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:24,270
And we have a rising star.

2076
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:25,850
Tofu.

2077
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:29,530
My first generation.

2078
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:33,810
We can help you turn this place around.

2079
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:35,390
You know we can.

2080
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:38,490
He has a really big fan base already.

2081
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:39,730
Mr. Endo.

2082
01:53:41,130 --> 01:53:43,490
A book stop is about to open.

2083
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:46,750
This is an old friend of mine, so please don't mess it up.

2084
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:51,570
As a new store opens, I'll be in touch.

2085
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:53,650
Just make sure you send good mascots.

2086
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:54,950
You know what?

2087
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:57,550
A tofu mascot will work great with this one.

2088
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:00,170
Calm atmosphere for enjoying books.

2089
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:02,470
They have a lot of comfortable sofas and houseplants.

2090
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:11,070
I'll tell other business owners in this town that you're back in business.

2091
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:14,590
Hopefully it will bring some people back to the shopping street.

2092
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:17,870
We look forward to serving you.

2093
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:20,090
See ya!

2094
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:24,710
Told you it was a crusty old geezer.

2095
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:28,930
May this humble dragon get a happy birthday, villain!

2096
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:30,110
Thank you for the super chat!

2097
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:30,990
Thank you, thank you!

2098
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:31,450
Of course!

2099
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:33,210
Happy birthday to you.

2100
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:35,430
Happy birthday to you.

2101
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:37,870
Happy birthday...

2102
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:40,830
I don't know why I forgot the birthday song for a second.

2103
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,870
Happy birthday, dear villain!

2104
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:44,530
Happy birthday to you!

2105
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:45,150
Yeah!

2106
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:46,250
Happy birthday!

2107
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:48,230
I was like, what goes after happy birthday?

2108
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:53,090
I was just like, what goes after that?

2109
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:54,730
Oh yeah, another happy birthday.

2110
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:58,610
Guys, I've been reading a lot.

2111
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:03,270
And tomorrow is Super Mario Ma with more reading.

2112
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:06,590
As long as you give us work, it doesn't matter.

2113
01:55:09,630 --> 01:55:10,590
What do you say, boss?

2114
01:55:13,390 --> 01:55:15,490
I'll take you through the next steps in the truck.

2115
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:19,720
Alright.

2116
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:21,040
Oh, I've got more fans!

2117
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:26,980
You'll see notifications about job requests at the top right of the HUD.

2118
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:33,680
The bar at the top left of the HUD shows you how many open job offers you have, and how many jobs are currently in progress.

2119
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:36,700
Open the Magic Menu to view and accept your jobs.

2120
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:39,440
The button prompt for the Magic Menu is on the top left.

2121
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:41,420
It requires one mascot.

2122
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:45,920
If you don't have any spare mascots, wait until one finishes your current job or find another one to recruit.

2123
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:51,000
Job offers stick around, so don't worry about accepting them immediately if you don't have a spare mascot.

2124
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:53,880
Jobs will have a preferred mascot type that they want.

2125
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:56,460
Don't worry if you don't have a mascot of that type.

2126
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,160
All that gets you is a bonus reward.

2127
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,260
You can still do the job.

2128
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:00,660
That'll make sense.

2129
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:01,520
Wanna hear again?

2130
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,020
Yeah, I'm good.

2131
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:04,560
Awesome.

2132
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:06,900
We should explore the town to look for more potential clients.

2133
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:07,920
Wah!

2134
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:12,000
More clients means more jobs, and more jobs means more yen!

2135
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:14,260
People should be waking up now.

2136
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:17,220
It is a lovely sunny morning to do some business.

2137
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:18,360
Alright, Tofu.

2138
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,920
Are you ready for your first job?

2139
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,360
Okay, let me see.

2140
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:25,360
Okay, uh...

2141
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:27,900
Uh...

2142
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:28,980
Alright, Tofu.

2143
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:32,600
Has enough mascot, has the right type.

2144
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,460
Oh my god, we're gonna get a bonus!

2145
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:37,300
Yay!

2146
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:39,360
We got 150 fans!

2147
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:41,560
Nice.

2148
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:42,860
Don't worry, Tofu.

2149
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:44,440
They're gonna love you.

2150
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:46,320
Alright, nice.

2151
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:47,960
And then we should get more jobs now.

2152
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:52,660
You just sent a mascot on the first job!

2153
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,100
It's her first job, guys!

2154
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:54,940
Her first stream!

2155
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:55,900
She's debuting!

2156
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,220
She's debuting!

2157
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:58,740
She's debuting now!

2158
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:02,040
Right at the top of the business world.

2159
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,080
Jobs take a certain amount of time to complete.

2160
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,280
During that time, the basket is unavailable for any other work.

2161
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:10,960
Jerry will get them to the job location and run the event on behalf of the client.

2162
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:15,680
You can't take them to the event because you're supposed to be dead and events are streamed online.

2163
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:18,640
Hopefully, everything will go well.

2164
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:22,160
But if it does go sideways, Jory will give you a call to let you know.

2165
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:24,660
You might have noticed the job has stamina requirement.

2166
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:31,160
The event streamed a mascot to stamina, so if the mascot has low stamina, they can still go to the job but more likely to get in trouble.

2167
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:35,920
Samma will replenish over time, so it's your call to let them rest or keep working.

2168
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,680
That'll make sense, right?

2169
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:39,140
Yeah, that makes sense.

2170
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,040
Oh my god, we're at the gameplay part.

2171
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:42,540
Finally.

2172
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,100
We did it!

2173
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,300
We're at the gameplay part!

2174
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,560
Can I get more jobs from Endo?

2175
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,180
Hey, I'm back!

2176
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:56,440
Did you like it?

2177
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,180
Do you like the mascot I sent over, Endo?

2178
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,020
Oh, I can get us a...

2179
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,840
You want to be a mascot support hero, do you?

2180
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:10,420
I know you're a crusty old geezer, but I think you can help a mascot out.

2181
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:12,440
You must have some life advice or something.

2182
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,460
I'm not going to become a mascot support hero.

2183
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,280
I'm not cut out for it.

2184
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,200
Sorry.

2185
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:20,080
We won't tell her.

2186
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:21,500
I know you want to do it.

2187
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:23,000
I can see it in your eyes.

2188
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:29,080
A esteemed member of the community like yourself will be a huge help and inspiration to our mascots.

2189
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:32,620
Well, you put it like that.

2190
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:33,400
Good!

2191
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:35,080
Glad to have you on board!

2192
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:36,280
Thanks, Endo!

2193
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,620
You guys are going to come to Tofu's debut, right?

2194
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:41,660
Alright, nice.

2195
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:42,680
I got the...

2196
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:43,660
What's the town quest?

2197
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:47,760
Is there anything else we can do to help with the business that are opening?

2198
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:49,320
That depends.

2199
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:51,700
Why does someone like you come to a town like this?

2200
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:54,880
I want to build a successful business to do that.

2201
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:56,160
I need a town to prosper.

2202
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:57,960
Sorry.

2203
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:59,740
This town has suffered for a long time.

2204
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:01,140
Just keep working hard.

2205
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:05,480
And hopefully, we can work together to improve the town and the businesses in there.

2206
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:07,100
Alright.

2207
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,360
Alright, we got the support card.

2208
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:13,680
Oh, yeah?

2209
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:16,140
Then why aren't you on her debut right now, huh?

2210
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:16,160
Huh?

2211
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:19,480
Yeah?

2212
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:22,420
He's literally...

2213
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:23,100
Oh wait, what's this?

2214
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:23,860
Oh, it's a stamp!

2215
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,060
Do I have to drive there?

2216
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,100
Can I get out of my car?

2217
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:29,800
I can't believe it.

2218
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:32,940
Tofu's out there doing his debut?

2219
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,800
And you're not even there to support him?

2220
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,760
I can't believe it!

2221
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:40,980
Alright.

2222
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:41,580
Let's see.

2223
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,120
Smash the old order.

2224
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:44,140
Oh!

2225
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,100
I got more fans for like...

2226
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:47,720
For like running things over.

2227
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,120
Wait, Tofu needs help!

2228
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:50,600
What did you do?

2229
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:54,820
Yes.

2230
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,720
What is it?

2231
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:57,860
We got a trump...

2232
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:59,640
What did you do, Tofu Dachis?

2233
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:01,340
I thought you were supposed to support...

2234
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:06,970
I'm on a job, and this damn mascot has caused a mess.

2235
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:11,350
Here's the deal.

2236
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:15,870
If a mascot gets in trouble on a job, you need to decide whether you want to help them or not.

2237
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:19,810
You need to choose to ignore the cry for help, but that's not very cool.

2238
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:24,470
If you help them, you'll need to choose which heroes will best get them through their outer mean.

2239
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:29,250
All the mascot events are streamed online, so I'll send you a link and you can watch this girl.

2240
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:32,730
When the mascot gets in trouble, just choose which hero to use.

2241
02:00:32,730 --> 02:00:35,010
And hero manages to help the mascot.

2242
02:00:35,210 --> 02:00:38,030
To get your mascot out of trouble, and everyone goes home happy.

2243
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:41,030
Oh my god, how did Tofu mess up his first...

2244
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:42,410
His first debut!

2245
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:43,870
His debut stream!

2246
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:47,590
Oh my god, he was muted.

2247
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:49,270
He was muted in his karaoke.

2248
02:00:49,970 --> 02:00:53,430
The mascot will still complete the job, but the client won't pay as much.

2249
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:57,490
The mascot will also be unhappy and get fewer stat views since they messed up.

2250
02:00:58,030 --> 02:00:59,150
Anyway, boss man.

2251
02:00:59,430 --> 02:01:00,130
That's the deal.

2252
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,470
Want me to go through again?

2253
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:01,870
Alright.

2254
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:02,630
Give me the...

2255
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:03,670
Give me the stream link.

2256
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:05,110
Oh my god, Tofu.

2257
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:06,190
What's going on?

2258
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:08,050
What's going on, Tofu?

2259
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,630
What's going on in your debut stream?

2260
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:11,070
I'm watching it right now.

2261
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:14,490
Oh my god, there's 18 people watching now.

2262
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:17,410
Welcome to another mascot event livestream!

2263
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,690
I'm your host for today.

2264
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:21,390
It's Mike Miller.

2265
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:22,070
Okay.

2266
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:23,570
It's...

2267
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:24,590
Okay.

2268
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:26,670
It's Mike Miller.

2269
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:27,350
What a...

2270
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,950
What a name.

2271
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:35,410
I may be in the studio in Tokyo by posting every livestream of every mascot event and every time.

2272
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:39,670
Promise has opened and the mascot is already up to events.

2273
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:43,370
Every event starts with a mascot handler introducing the mascot to the crowd.

2274
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:45,350
Kusa.

2275
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:46,390
WWW.

2276
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:50,070
Promise mascot agency mascot handler is getting the audience ready...

2277
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:51,350
Warmed up.

2278
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:52,330
Ready for Tofu.

2279
02:01:52,330 --> 02:01:53,070
Here we go.

2280
02:01:53,230 --> 02:01:53,790
Tofu!

2281
02:01:55,530 --> 02:01:56,090
Tofu!

2282
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:00,670
It's about to explode into the limelight.

2283
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,030
Did you see that crowd is ready?

2284
02:02:02,410 --> 02:02:03,370
Anticipation is high.

2285
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:04,250
Go Tofu!

2286
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:04,610
Go!

2287
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:16,650
What a small door.

2288
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:18,550
How's the mascot supposed to fit through?

2289
02:02:18,970 --> 02:02:20,030
Stop laughing!

2290
02:02:22,730 --> 02:02:25,470
Looks like Tofu is in real trouble now.

2291
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:28,030
Send in the heroes!

2292
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:31,710
Versus normal sized door.

2293
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:33,570
Press any key.

2294
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:37,130
You'll need to overcome the obstacle.

2295
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:37,930
What do I do?

2296
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:39,590
By reducing its health?

2297
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:40,410
What do I do?

2298
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:42,930
Make sure you have...

2299
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:43,790
Okay.

2300
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:47,970
Happiest popularity total damage.

2301
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:48,330
Oh!

2302
02:02:48,870 --> 02:02:49,650
Don't lose her!

2303
02:02:51,090 --> 02:02:52,730
Now your heroes will help the mascot.

2304
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:54,070
Each hero deals damage.

2305
02:02:54,230 --> 02:02:56,270
They are strengths and weaknesses to different obstacle types.

2306
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:57,550
What's the obstacle type?

2307
02:02:59,230 --> 02:02:59,670
Oh!

2308
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:01,550
Wait, I'm playing a card game?

2309
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:05,190
Your two actions lose when you run out of actions.

2310
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:06,570
You haven't defeated the obstacle.

2311
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:10,870
Um...

2312
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:11,870
More cards when you play them.

2313
02:03:11,950 --> 02:03:14,350
Try to play a combination of cards that give you enough...

2314
02:03:14,350 --> 02:03:17,610
Actions and cards to defeat the obstacle and save the day.

2315
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:19,190
Um...

2316
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:19,810
Oh...

2317
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:21,450
Plus one.

2318
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:22,930
Plus one.

2319
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:24,630
Oh, nice!

2320
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:25,650
I got an extra turn!

2321
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:27,950
The hero card costs...

2322
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:29,770
So your remaining actions have been reduced by one.

2323
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:32,190
You now have one action remaining.

2324
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:33,370
Play your next card.

2325
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:34,510
Um...

2326
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:35,090
Plus 14.

2327
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:37,570
Yeah!

2328
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:38,250
We did it!

2329
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:38,610
We did it!

2330
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,890
We saved it!

2331
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:42,250
We did it!

2332
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:44,650
We overcome normal...

2333
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,080
Those heroes really help.

2334
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:01,300
We will not submit to tier in your small doors.

2335
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:02,660
Good job, Tofu.

2336
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:03,760
Oh my god!

2337
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:05,780
And the view count is getting higher!

2338
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,340
Let's go!

2339
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:09,260
We're at 22 viewers!

2340
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,440
He's a star.

2341
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:15,640
He's gonna be my next star.

2342
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:18,200
Let's go!

2343
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:18,560
Let's go!

2344
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,380
Good job, Tofu!

2345
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,440
You have 22 new fans now!

2346
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:26,020
Alright, good mascot, Tofu K.

2347
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:28,880
Buffs.

2348
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:29,500
Agency.

2349
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:35,700
Hey boss, since this is the first job one your mascot has completed, I show you the detailed results.

2350
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,820
Future results of completed jobs will appear.

2351
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:38,740
Okay.

2352
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:39,380
Nice.

2353
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:41,780
Oh my god, he has potential.

2354
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:42,760
You're right, guys.

2355
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:44,920
First stream already, 22 viewers?

2356
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:46,160
Good potential.

2357
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:48,000
I'm gonna make him a star.

2358
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,620
When a job...

2359
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:49,900
Wow!

2360
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:54,620
When a job is completed, you get rewards like money, new fans, and mascots improve their popularity.

2361
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:57,020
You may also get some life satisfaction.

2362
02:04:57,620 --> 02:05:00,000
I need to tell you about something extremely important.

2363
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:01,480
Go on.

2364
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:05,840
If you're ever not sure what to do, you can hit the big old Ask Pickney button.

2365
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:09,820
I've got loads of advice and thoughts on what you can do to improve the business.

2366
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:14,580
However, I discovered people have extreme distaste for my unsolicited opinion.

2367
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,280
So now, only give advice when you press that button.

2368
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:19,400
Don't forget about that button.

2369
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,680
You're wondering about this whole of a town without any idea what to do.

2370
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:23,920
Have you got it?

2371
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:25,240
Use the Ask?

2372
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:25,560
Okay.

2373
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,420
Yeah, I got it.

2374
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,340
Good.

2375
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:32,260
Some people still haven't used it despite me telling them quite clearly that they should.

2376
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,120
Don't be like that, Michi.

2377
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:40,300
Speaking of which, I got a bad feeling about jobs getting more difficult and us needing more heroes.

2378
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:42,540
Won't you and Shiri be enough?

2379
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:46,780
Our mascots are gonna step into the fires of hill.

2380
02:05:46,940 --> 02:05:47,780
Oh my god.

2381
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:51,760
Tofu might step into a smaller door, guys.

2382
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,360
What do I...

2383
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:58,980
What do I do when they get through a smaller door?

2384
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,200
Papa Smurf, thank you for Magenta Supa.

2385
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:04,180
Thank you, thank you.

2386
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:10,060
My Kami Oshi got announced at Offcut and then she introduced me to a bunch of new Oshi prospects on my birthday.

2387
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,840
Thanks for all the presents, Doki.

2388
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,220
Thank you for Magenta Supa.

2389
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:15,160
Thank you, thank you.

2390
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:16,880
And a happy birthday to you.

2391
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:20,320
Papa Smurf, happy birthday to you.

2392
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,200
Happy birthday to you.

2393
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:24,480
Happy birthday, dear Papa Smurf.

2394
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:26,240
Happy birthday to you.

2395
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:26,740
Yeah!

2396
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:29,320
I get it.

2397
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:29,880
What do we do?

2398
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:32,300
There's a local hero called Captain Sign.

2399
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:33,440
Let's go see him.

2400
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:37,060
I'm marking this as a critical quest because this is hella important.

2401
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:41,840
He hangs out on a weird wooden platform overlooking the town near the agency.

2402
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,660
Let's go make some money and get you back in Shimazu's good books.

2403
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:47,880
Alright.

2404
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:49,380
Let's go make some money.

2405
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:50,580
Okay, we gotta...

2406
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:52,660
Okay, we gotta go this way.

2407
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,660
Go and see Captain Sign.

2408
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,860
Alright, what does the heart mean, though?

2409
02:06:58,440 --> 02:06:58,960
Alright.

2410
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:01,140
No, we're not gonna ask...

2411
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:03,060
Alright, we'll ask Pinky.

2412
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:06,240
Huh?

2413
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:08,040
What about mascots?

2414
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:09,700
Let me check the message.

2415
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,040
Shea said there's a goth mascot that hangs out at the graveyard?

2416
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:15,980
The graveyard is near the rice field.

2417
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:17,060
Oh, let's go!

2418
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:18,880
Let's go get her.

2419
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:20,340
Alright, where's the...

2420
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:23,020
Oh, that's not it.

2421
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:25,000
Wait, let's go to the goth mask.

2422
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,200
Where's the graveyard?

2423
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,140
Promise mascot.

2424
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:30,320
Priest.

2425
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:32,600
Creepy apartments.

2426
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:33,760
Hot spring.

2427
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,460
Wait, I wanna recruit a goth mascot.

2428
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:38,580
People like that.

2429
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:40,600
Abandoned tea farm.

2430
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:43,060
Wait, where the fuck is the cemetery?

2431
02:07:44,730 --> 02:07:46,460
I assume like...

2432
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:47,380
Mama-san.

2433
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:52,440
I assume...

2434
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:52,980
Wait, why is...

2435
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:55,160
Is that just like a PNG of a real person?

2436
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:58,720
This looks like a photo of a real person.

2437
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:01,320
Mine's...

2438
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:02,440
Creepy apartment.

2439
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:05,860
Where the fuck is the cemetery?

2440
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:08,600
Oh, it's...

2441
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:09,200
Oh, there it is!

2442
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,300
Oh, I'm so blind.

2443
02:08:11,460 --> 02:08:13,000
I'm so blind.

2444
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:14,640
Alright, I see it.

2445
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:17,840
Alright, let's go to the cemetery, guys.

2446
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,300
I have to drive back to this bridge.

2447
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:23,720
This is our first job.

2448
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:27,540
I want a goth mascot in my agency.

2449
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:29,700
But y'all get like...

2450
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:30,880
One of each type.

2451
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:32,600
To fit all the niches.

2452
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,340
And all the tastes.

2453
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,820
And I'll talk to you later, okay?

2454
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:40,420
This is more important right now.

2455
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:43,320
Oh, there's somebody's wallet.

2456
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:44,000
Nice.

2457
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:44,500
Yoink!

2458
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:48,260
Alright.

2459
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:49,380
Don't worry.

2460
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:50,660
We don't need the rice here.

2461
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:52,740
Is that the cemetery?

2462
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:54,320
It's like above, right?

2463
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,060
Oh, it's here.

2464
02:08:57,860 --> 02:08:58,420
Whoops.

2465
02:08:59,180 --> 02:08:59,860
It's fine.

2466
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:02,000
The truck is indestructible.

2467
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:04,720
Alright, where is she?

2468
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,600
Wait, that's...

2469
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:08,700
Wait, that's...

2470
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:08,740
Oh.

2471
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,040
Not gonna lie.

2472
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:12,860
I thought...

2473
02:09:12,860 --> 02:09:14,360
She'd be a little hotter.

2474
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,240
Um...

2475
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,220
We can make it work.

2476
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,220
We can...

2477
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:26,020
We can...

2478
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:27,660
We can make this work.

2479
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:32,180
Yo, what's up?

2480
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,160
She's perfect.

2481
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:35,920
Whoa.

2482
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:36,980
Okay.

2483
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:39,160
I was not expecting that voice.

2484
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:40,340
I...

2485
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:42,320
Are you here for a tour?

2486
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:46,260
Whoa.

2487
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:49,320
A tour of what?

2488
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:53,640
Wait.

2489
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:04,920
I can see people...

2490
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:06,280
When she makes her debut.

2491
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:07,920
Can you say Aura?

2492
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:08,380
Aura!

2493
02:10:11,130 --> 02:10:14,110
I'm the mascot currently taking care of...

2494
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:15,030
Katsu.

2495
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:17,890
Machi's ancient burial crown.

2496
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:22,110
Can't understand and why...

2497
02:10:22,110 --> 02:10:23,930
Why people don't care about history more.

2498
02:10:24,090 --> 02:10:25,690
Underfunded and unhappy.

2499
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:29,090
There's a graveyard mascot?

2500
02:10:29,330 --> 02:10:29,670
Okay.

2501
02:10:29,810 --> 02:10:30,490
Leave your job.

2502
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:33,150
That's...

2503
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:34,890
That's a pretty niche market.

2504
02:10:43,130 --> 02:10:44,510
That's what I was thinking.

2505
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,230
I was like, how is this goth?

2506
02:10:46,330 --> 02:10:48,010
Green is the new goth.

2507
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:50,590
Oh Samson, I'm just a tear-taker.

2508
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:53,110
Keeping it all as presentable as I can by myself.

2509
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:56,850
Who's employing you?

2510
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:59,530
Is it the town hall or mascot work agency?

2511
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:09,610
The town hall used to pay my wages for the tours, but there were budget cuts.

2512
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:14,670
Some people at the town hall, if you ask me.

2513
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:15,650
Jesus, her voice.

2514
02:11:19,350 --> 02:11:23,010
I'm gonna budget cut some people at the town hall, if you ask me.

2515
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:31,270
I just couldn't stand by and watch the graveyard fall into ruins.

2516
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:34,810
Like the rest of the town, so I'm doing it for free.

2517
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:39,090
Okay.

2518
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:47,410
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

2519
02:11:47,570 --> 02:11:48,390
Thank you, thank you.

2520
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:51,810
Do keep chat, so can you give us good dragoons and...

2521
02:11:57,170 --> 02:11:59,010
That's the source of the curse.

2522
02:12:01,050 --> 02:12:03,090
Are the spirits mad at us?

2523
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:05,430
No.

2524
02:12:08,210 --> 02:12:08,770
Perfect.

2525
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:19,270
Some are angry.

2526
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:20,390
Some are understanding.

2527
02:12:20,650 --> 02:12:21,330
Some are lost.

2528
02:12:21,490 --> 02:12:23,570
They're individuals just like us.

2529
02:12:26,830 --> 02:12:27,390
Wait.

2530
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:29,290
Are you from the mascot agency?

2531
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:35,490
A rambuncious young lady named Shiori spoke to me earlier.

2532
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:40,330
Yes, my name is Michi and this is Pinky.

2533
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,970
Michi, really?

2534
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:55,550
You got a problem with that punk?

2535
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:58,390
You heard something you shouldn't have about the boss here.

2536
02:12:58,690 --> 02:13:14,930
Yeah, yeah.

2537
02:13:14,930 --> 02:13:15,270
The ladder.

2538
02:13:15,450 --> 02:13:16,250
That is horrifying.

2539
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:18,370
Yeah, they're like...

2540
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:19,090
Real...

2541
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:21,210
It's like Fall Guys anatomy.

2542
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:23,010
You know, like you think...

2543
02:13:23,010 --> 02:13:23,530
Like the...

2544
02:13:23,530 --> 02:13:25,570
You don't think about what's inside the bean.

2545
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:28,390
But like they're actual things...

2546
02:13:28,390 --> 02:13:29,550
That are walking around.

2547
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:30,770
Like...

2548
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:31,830
They're real.

2549
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,730
They're not like people inside a costume.

2550
02:13:36,750 --> 02:13:39,150
My name uses the same written characters.

2551
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:42,950
No way.

2552
02:13:43,210 --> 02:13:44,450
That's lovely to hear.

2553
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:53,270
Do you know of his poems?

2554
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:55,630
He was completely enamored with plum trees.

2555
02:13:55,870 --> 02:13:57,590
And often featured them in his work.

2556
02:13:57,590 --> 02:13:57,630
There.

2557
02:13:59,850 --> 02:14:03,650
I can see from your tattoos that you have a connection with them too, Michi.

2558
02:14:07,490 --> 02:14:09,630
What do you have a connection with, Kofun?

2559
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:12,410
The dead mostly.

2560
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:13,330
And cats.

2561
02:14:16,390 --> 02:14:18,190
It tends to creep people out.

2562
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:21,150
But Kasomachi is a place of limbo.

2563
02:14:21,670 --> 02:14:23,210
And I embrace it.

2564
02:14:27,590 --> 02:14:30,410
I will continue to promote and research the town's history.

2565
02:14:30,670 --> 02:14:33,850
And connect people with all the wonderful people that have lived here in the past.

2566
02:14:42,190 --> 02:14:44,190
We can use a mascot like yourself.

2567
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:46,310
One who knows the town's history and strengths.

2568
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:52,570
We're trying to cleanse the bad energy from this town.

2569
02:14:53,810 --> 02:14:54,330
Really?

2570
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:03,970
We'll pay you to represent Kasomachi and help us settle the spirits.

2571
02:15:06,850 --> 02:15:10,490
And we need a mommy goth cat mascot.

2572
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:12,770
For the fans out there.

2573
02:15:13,610 --> 02:15:15,770
Somebody is interested in that somewhere.

2574
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:18,890
Time for change, darling.

2575
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:24,290
We're gonna make the best mascot agency and crush Kiroshi under our foot.

2576
02:15:25,810 --> 02:15:27,770
There's definitely a market for that.

2577
02:15:36,070 --> 02:15:36,850
There's definitely a market for that.

2578
02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:37,810
It's me.

2579
02:15:38,070 --> 02:15:38,510
It's me.

2580
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:40,970
I'm into that specific thing.

2581
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:46,370
Green, goth, mommy, cat, mascot things.

2582
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:55,410
No one wants a mascot shaped like a burial mound promoting their business.

2583
02:15:55,610 --> 02:15:57,970
Not even Kasomachi, the town of the dead.

2584
02:15:58,270 --> 02:15:59,670
They fired me, remember?

2585
02:16:01,330 --> 02:16:04,310
Cute mascots are all the rage now.

2586
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:06,250
Don't worry, coffin.

2587
02:16:06,670 --> 02:16:07,650
We have...

2588
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:09,470
What are her fans called, guys?

2589
02:16:09,470 --> 02:16:10,350
What are...

2590
02:16:13,210 --> 02:16:15,490
But I love goth girls.

2591
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:21,730
Next to you, thank you for this super chat.

2592
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:22,770
Thank you, thank you.

2593
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:26,110
She's cute to me.

2594
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:32,380
Don't let me worry about that.

2595
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:33,620
We'll make them see sense.

2596
02:16:40,030 --> 02:16:42,190
Yeah, we're all about business deals.

2597
02:16:42,330 --> 02:16:46,090
Pie lunches, wireless headsets, and making dreams come true.

2598
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:46,870
Don't worry.

2599
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:50,070
The cadavers are here to support you, coffin.

2600
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:53,710
Even though you're Yakuza?

2601
02:16:54,090 --> 02:16:57,030
I'm sorry, I always admire your tattoos.

2602
02:17:01,410 --> 02:17:03,830
They think you're cute, coffin.

2603
02:17:07,370 --> 02:17:08,530
What about the curse?

2604
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:10,590
Why did you come to this town?

2605
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:19,410
I won't let it get me until I'm done my job.

2606
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:21,250
I will do it to my family.

2607
02:17:21,530 --> 02:17:24,110
And Kasomachi is the only place I can perform it.

2608
02:17:29,810 --> 02:17:32,010
Okay, I admire your determination.

2609
02:17:33,390 --> 02:17:33,870
Yay!

2610
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:36,130
Alright, I'll give you...

2611
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:40,030
5% And the time off.

2612
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:42,370
Alright.

2613
02:17:44,030 --> 02:17:45,670
How about I give you that?

2614
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:47,410
You get 8.

2615
02:17:47,690 --> 02:17:48,370
I don't know.

2616
02:17:48,550 --> 02:17:49,910
Who would make me more money?

2617
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:51,170
Tofu or coffin?

2618
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:52,990
Do we have like...

2619
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:56,430
Big coffin fans that could...

2620
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:57,370
Like...

2621
02:17:57,370 --> 02:18:00,630
Do we have like secret coffin or oiler...

2622
02:18:00,630 --> 02:18:01,790
Like cadaver oilers?

2623
02:18:02,010 --> 02:18:02,810
So that...

2624
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:05,170
Justifies me giving her a bigger pay?

2625
02:18:06,090 --> 02:18:06,630
Tofu?

2626
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:08,810
Okay, I'll give her a list of a share then.

2627
02:18:09,230 --> 02:18:09,550
Sorry.

2628
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:11,570
But uh...

2629
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:13,510
But you're not as popular as...

2630
02:18:13,510 --> 02:18:15,510
Oh yeah, your popularity is at 3.0.

2631
02:18:15,630 --> 02:18:16,010
You're right.

2632
02:18:16,390 --> 02:18:16,750
You're right.

2633
02:18:16,850 --> 02:18:17,110
I'm sorry.

2634
02:18:17,250 --> 02:18:17,730
You don't have a...

2635
02:18:17,730 --> 02:18:18,470
Oh wait, but...

2636
02:18:18,470 --> 02:18:20,090
It's 750 fans!

2637
02:18:20,270 --> 02:18:21,510
Wait, she has more fans!

2638
02:18:21,510 --> 02:18:24,850
I dumped tofu for coffin!

2639
02:18:27,350 --> 02:18:28,350
You're right.

2640
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:29,710
Alright.

2641
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:31,890
I'll give you...

2642
02:18:32,510 --> 02:18:33,710
I'll give you...

2643
02:18:34,070 --> 02:18:34,390
Okay.

2644
02:18:35,130 --> 02:18:36,730
I'm trying to...

2645
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:37,950
It's fine.

2646
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:39,670
She can have time off.

2647
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:40,510
And then...

2648
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:41,730
Trading!

2649
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:44,490
She has potential.

2650
02:18:44,490 --> 02:18:45,390
I agree.

2651
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:49,050
I think she might have potential to do more than tofu.

2652
02:18:51,510 --> 02:18:52,170
Alright.

2653
02:18:52,670 --> 02:18:55,530
Tofutachis, you're my public enemy now.

2654
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:56,690
Alright.

2655
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:58,870
We'll do...

2656
02:18:59,510 --> 02:19:02,210
I'll make her a little bit more happier then.

2657
02:19:05,230 --> 02:19:05,910
Actually...

2658
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:06,390
Oh my gosh.

2659
02:19:06,450 --> 02:19:08,110
She takes a bigger share too.

2660
02:19:08,710 --> 02:19:09,830
I'll do this.

2661
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:10,770
I'll do this.

2662
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:12,510
Alright.

2663
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:14,410
That's enough motivation.

2664
02:19:14,890 --> 02:19:16,430
She does have more fans.

2665
02:19:18,630 --> 02:19:19,310
Okay.

2666
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:22,330
I would say she does have more fans.

2667
02:19:22,630 --> 02:19:23,790
So I'll give her a bigger share.

2668
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:28,350
Loves to goff it up at the cemetery.

2669
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:30,070
Alright.

2670
02:19:31,650 --> 02:19:32,050
Well...

2671
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:36,510
Yeah, the more...

2672
02:19:36,510 --> 02:19:38,750
The better you do, the more pay I'll give you, coffin.

2673
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:46,510
I'm gonna spread the history of Kasumachi far and wide.

2674
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:48,710
And make everyone proud of this town.

2675
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:52,310
Alright.

2676
02:19:52,390 --> 02:19:54,970
Are you guys a tofu dachi or a cadaver, guys?

2677
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:56,330
What are you?

2678
02:19:57,290 --> 02:19:59,050
Do I have any jobs for her?

2679
02:19:59,630 --> 02:20:00,170
No.

2680
02:20:00,510 --> 02:20:00,650
Okay.

2681
02:20:00,650 --> 02:20:02,210
I don't have any right now.

2682
02:20:04,610 --> 02:20:04,910
Uh...

2683
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:06,130
Crunch here.

2684
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:08,470
I mean, they're all very satisfied.

2685
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:11,690
Alright.

2686
02:20:12,150 --> 02:20:12,770
Let's see.

2687
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:13,710
Where do I wanna go?

2688
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:17,390
Uh...

2689
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:17,810
Let's see.

2690
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:19,070
Is there any other...

2691
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:21,070
Any other...

2692
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:22,010
Other mascots?

2693
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:23,730
Tofu dachis for life.

2694
02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:28,150
There's a mechanic near...

2695
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:28,570
He might be...

2696
02:20:28,570 --> 02:20:28,710
Oh!

2697
02:20:31,190 --> 02:20:32,210
Let's go see my...

2698
02:20:32,210 --> 02:20:32,610
Oh, okay.

2699
02:20:32,670 --> 02:20:33,630
Let's go see the mechanic.

2700
02:20:34,730 --> 02:20:35,170
And...

2701
02:20:35,170 --> 02:20:37,950
We'll see the mechanic, get a job, and then send...

2702
02:20:37,950 --> 02:20:39,030
We can send...

2703
02:20:39,030 --> 02:20:39,510
Uh...

2704
02:20:39,510 --> 02:20:40,090
Tofu...

2705
02:20:40,090 --> 02:20:40,210
No.

2706
02:20:40,450 --> 02:20:42,250
We can send coffin out to her first job.

2707
02:20:43,850 --> 02:20:45,110
I'm just a dragoon.

2708
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:50,070
Wait, I hear money over here.

2709
02:20:51,270 --> 02:20:51,710
Money...

2710
02:20:52,010 --> 02:20:52,630
Alright, whatever.

2711
02:20:53,070 --> 02:20:53,950
I'll just grab this.

2712
02:20:54,450 --> 02:20:54,710
Eh...

2713
02:20:54,710 --> 02:20:55,390
It's just 800.

2714
02:20:57,030 --> 02:20:57,550
Uh...

2715
02:20:57,550 --> 02:20:58,230
Let's see.

2716
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:00,730
Oop.

2717
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:01,810
No, I didn't need advice.

2718
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:03,270
I was trying to get the map out.

2719
02:21:05,890 --> 02:21:06,410
Uh...

2720
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:07,790
Where is the mechanic?

2721
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:10,770
Wait, why can't I move it?

2722
02:21:10,810 --> 02:21:11,410
Oh, there it is.

2723
02:21:11,550 --> 02:21:11,690
Okay.

2724
02:21:11,970 --> 02:21:13,030
Let's get to the mechanic.

2725
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:14,550
220.

2726
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:16,730
Doki's company seems to like...

2727
02:21:16,730 --> 02:21:17,990
Underpaying their...

2728
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:18,350
Look!

2729
02:21:18,490 --> 02:21:20,010
They're just getting started!

2730
02:21:20,050 --> 02:21:20,570
Okay?

2731
02:21:21,550 --> 02:21:22,070
Uh...

2732
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:23,990
My payment is merit-based.

2733
02:21:24,290 --> 02:21:27,890
So I need them to prove themselves before I give them a pay raise.

2734
02:21:28,610 --> 02:21:29,790
Thank you for this super chat.

2735
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:30,770
Um, and...

2736
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:31,250
Uh...

2737
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:31,570
Thank you.

2738
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:32,150
Thank you.

2739
02:21:32,750 --> 02:21:35,270
They just haven't proved themselves yet, guys.

2740
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:39,110
I need to know if they're actually good at their jobs.

2741
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:42,830
Oh, clean shrine.

2742
02:21:42,970 --> 02:21:43,730
We should clean the shrine.

2743
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:51,940
Where do I get out of this?

2744
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:54,920
Oh, I get 50 fans!

2745
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:55,380
Nice!

2746
02:21:58,440 --> 02:21:58,920
Uh...

2747
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:01,380
Provides a small bonus to the money earned from selling...

2748
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:01,640
Oh!

2749
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:03,660
Okay, we're gonna make merch soon.

2750
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:06,340
Merch is like the biggest money maker...

2751
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:07,000
For us.

2752
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,900
Oh, let's park our car.

2753
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:12,280
I want Koffin to make her big debut.

2754
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:16,750
Hello!

2755
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:18,750
Hey!

2756
02:22:19,070 --> 02:22:19,810
Get back here!

2757
02:22:19,810 --> 02:22:20,750
Wait, Jose?

2758
02:22:21,250 --> 02:22:21,690
Hahaha!

2759
02:22:22,510 --> 02:22:22,990
What is...

2760
02:22:22,990 --> 02:22:23,850
What's Jose?

2761
02:22:24,090 --> 02:22:24,710
Why do I...

2762
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:25,590
Wait, why is his...

2763
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,670
His name is Jose.

2764
02:22:27,410 --> 02:22:28,290
His name...

2765
02:22:28,290 --> 02:22:29,550
Wait, I don't know if you guys see it.

2766
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:30,530
But you see the A.

2767
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:32,010
What is Jose doing here?

2768
02:22:32,410 --> 02:22:32,810
Hahaha!

2769
02:22:35,170 --> 02:22:35,910
Aw, man.

2770
02:22:38,430 --> 02:22:39,090
What the...

2771
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:40,690
What the heck is happening here?

2772
02:22:42,430 --> 02:22:44,210
He took my invention plans!

2773
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:47,630
I'm sorry, can I help you, folks?

2774
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:56,510
We're from the newly...

2775
02:22:57,550 --> 02:23:00,670
We're from the newly opened Promise mascot agency.

2776
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:03,070
My name is Michi and this is Pinky.

2777
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:04,190
Hajimemashite!

2778
02:23:05,030 --> 02:23:05,530
Hajimashite!

2779
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:07,930
Pleasure to meet you.

2780
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:09,020
I'm Jose Fujikawa.

2781
02:23:09,690 --> 02:23:11,730
Wait, but his last name is like...

2782
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:12,510
Japanese...

2783
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:12,870
Hahaha!

2784
02:23:15,130 --> 02:23:16,990
The happiest guy in town.

2785
02:23:17,150 --> 02:23:18,570
And a loving family man.

2786
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:20,330
Looks like he could build anything.

2787
02:23:22,330 --> 02:23:23,810
He could be half...

2788
02:23:23,810 --> 02:23:24,630
Yeah, he could be half.

2789
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:27,810
Oh, is he half Japanese?

2790
02:23:28,810 --> 02:23:29,930
What just happened?

2791
02:23:30,590 --> 02:23:33,190
The mountain spirits are angry with me.

2792
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:36,630
Those foxes just took all of my invention plans.

2793
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:42,370
Spirits are angry with you?

2794
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:44,730
I like spooky stuff.

2795
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:45,910
And years ago...

2796
02:23:46,910 --> 02:23:51,050
I heard some strange rumors about Kasomachi on the internet.

2797
02:23:56,210 --> 02:24:00,110
I went to investigate and ever since, the spirits have been angry with me.

2798
02:24:03,530 --> 02:24:05,730
Those foxes keep taking stuff from me.

2799
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:08,550
Yeah, that's messed up.

2800
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:10,510
It's...

2801
02:24:10,510 --> 02:24:14,550
Life is full of ups and downs.

2802
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:17,410
I just need to offer something to the spirits.

2803
02:24:17,690 --> 02:24:18,550
Oh, he's so happy.

2804
02:24:18,670 --> 02:24:19,790
He's like a golden retriever.

2805
02:24:21,810 --> 02:24:23,670
This is perfect for coffin.

2806
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:29,880
Don't give up!

2807
02:24:30,140 --> 02:24:31,220
Never give up!

2808
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:33,000
What do the foxes take?

2809
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:39,700
Well, I remember counting my day job.

2810
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:41,740
But I also like to take care of my own time.

2811
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:48,860
I came up with a few different methods to modify vehicles in new ways.

2812
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:50,340
Go on!

2813
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:54,020
Oh, those aren't really legal.

2814
02:24:56,260 --> 02:24:57,880
We are narcs.

2815
02:24:58,520 --> 02:24:59,620
Yeah, do we look like...

2816
02:24:59,620 --> 02:25:01,260
Do we look like cops to you?

2817
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:11,500
Well, I found a new way to squeeze more performance out of old style engines like the one in your truck.

2818
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:15,280
I also invented some stranger modification.

2819
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:17,780
A launcher system controlled from the cab.

2820
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:19,500
And a glider mode.

2821
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:21,520
Just wait!

2822
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:23,640
You said you can make a glide?

2823
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:24,680
Wait, I can fly?

2824
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:27,300
Oh my god, bro.

2825
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:28,420
Pattern that shit!

2826
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:31,420
Bro, I can have an actual flying car?

2827
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
And act like a boat on water?

2828
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,260
Bro, go fucking...

2829
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:38,660
Go back to Tokyo and pattern that shit, buddy!

2830
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:42,400
I can make your truck go faster.

2831
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:44,040
What is he doing here in this village?

2832
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:50,420
Let's you lodge projectiles and mod it to travel by sea and air?

2833
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:53,500
What is this guy doing here?

2834
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:58,320
Very efficient but not entirely legal.

2835
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:01,680
Jose the goat.

2836
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:09,110
This all sounds perfect.

2837
02:26:09,450 --> 02:26:13,270
This old truck is a piece of junk and it's about time it had some upgrades.

2838
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:15,990
My truck is fine.

2839
02:26:16,030 --> 02:26:17,190
It doesn't need upgrades.

2840
02:26:18,250 --> 02:26:20,610
You don't even have a fucking phone, old man!

2841
02:26:20,990 --> 02:26:22,070
Don't listen to him.

2842
02:26:22,290 --> 02:26:23,670
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

2843
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:29,510
I don't have whatever brain virus you have that makes you think that.

2844
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:31,110
So trust me when I say...

2845
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:31,490
Wrong!

2846
02:26:32,930 --> 02:26:33,610
You're wrong.

2847
02:26:37,150 --> 02:26:39,230
Bro, what is Jose doing here?

2848
02:26:39,470 --> 02:26:40,710
Nasa needs him.

2849
02:26:41,090 --> 02:26:42,510
No name, thank you for the super chat.

2850
02:26:42,650 --> 02:26:43,610
Thank you, thank you.

2851
02:26:46,070 --> 02:26:49,090
Guys, I don't know if you realize this but Nasa has had a lot of budget cuts.

2852
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:50,830
I don't think Nasa can afford Jose.

2853
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:54,130
This truck can barely make it up a hill.

2854
02:26:54,310 --> 02:26:58,490
It definitely can pick up hot babes or compete in drift races.

2855
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:05,110
Gabriel, thank you to the super chat.

2856
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:06,110
Thank you, thank you.

2857
02:27:06,230 --> 02:27:10,810
There was a lot of Portuguese influences in Japan, historically speaking.

2858
02:27:10,990 --> 02:27:12,530
So that name wouldn't be impossible to find.

2859
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:13,390
Thank you to the super chat.

2860
02:27:13,530 --> 02:27:14,190
Thank you, thank you.

2861
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:15,230
Oh, I didn't know that.

2862
02:27:15,390 --> 02:27:16,010
That's interesting.

2863
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:20,290
Shut.

2864
02:27:24,290 --> 02:27:24,650
Oh!

2865
02:27:24,650 --> 02:27:25,010
Michi!

2866
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:34,550
I know that you've replaced the intimate companionship in your life.

2867
02:27:34,670 --> 02:27:34,870
Oh!

2868
02:27:39,090 --> 02:27:40,590
Damn, Pinky!

2869
02:27:41,090 --> 02:27:42,180
Roast that fucker!

2870
02:27:45,730 --> 02:27:46,510
Whoa!

2871
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:53,990
I know that you've replaced intimate companionship in your life with loving this truck.

2872
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:56,150
But it's not cool.

2873
02:27:56,430 --> 02:27:57,450
You need help.

2874
02:27:57,650 --> 02:27:59,710
And if you ask me...

2875
02:27:59,710 --> 02:28:01,210
I didn't!

2876
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:01,690
Shh!

2877
02:28:01,930 --> 02:28:03,070
She doesn't mean that.

2878
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:07,950
Chuck-chan, she doesn't mean that.

2879
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:23,120
We need to put more nitrous boost in here.

2880
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:25,200
And get some kind of railgun to destroy obstacle.

2881
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:27,220
And make this piece of junk amphibious!

2882
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,700
No, we don't!

2883
02:28:32,340 --> 02:28:32,860
Hosee!

2884
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:55,800
Hosee!

2885
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:55,820
Hey!

2886
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:07,160
Sure, my kids love mascots.

2887
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:10,040
Besides, this place definitely needs a boost in business.

2888
02:29:10,660 --> 02:29:13,140
Okay, we just need to find his inventions.

2889
02:29:14,220 --> 02:29:14,960
Okay, but what if...

2890
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:18,220
We specialize in tuning drift cars.

2891
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:21,000
People from all over Kyoshi comes to see us.

2892
02:29:22,900 --> 02:29:24,920
Wait, maybe he's a single dad, guys.

2893
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:26,540
You guys have a chance.

2894
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:29,040
He didn't say anything about a wife.

2895
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:32,380
Can you lead that to us, sweet stuff?

2896
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:35,500
Oh, I can get...

2897
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:37,540
Okay, I'm gonna skip the dialogue for this.

2898
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:38,640
I'm...

2899
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:41,800
Actually, I'm used to running around after my kids, so they're a little tears.

2900
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:43,520
Sure, but I'll be a hero for you.

2901
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,980
It's the least I can do.

2902
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:46,900
You're gonna give me a chance to try out my inventions.

2903
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:48,140
Yeah!

2904
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:50,340
I got a loving family map.

2905
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:51,920
It doesn't say he has a wife, guys.

2906
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:52,880
Fine.

2907
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:53,860
Nice, okay.

2908
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:57,800
Okay, I wanna...

2909
02:30:00,220 --> 02:30:00,740
Thank you.

2910
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:02,280
Those spear foxes could be anywhere.

2911
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:02,700
Try it.

2912
02:30:02,820 --> 02:30:03,800
No, I want...

2913
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:05,700
Keep pretty weird.

2914
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:06,820
Why won't your wife be...

2915
02:30:06,820 --> 02:30:07,240
No!

2916
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:08,960
He has a wife!

2917
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:11,280
She puts up with me.

2918
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:11,960
I love her.

2919
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:12,880
Oh, my God.

2920
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,060
And he said the L word.

2921
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:16,920
I always get something in my head that I want to do.

2922
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,220
And she just lets me do it.

2923
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:21,080
I'm gonna kill myself.

2924
02:30:21,900 --> 02:30:22,800
Oh, my God.

2925
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:25,360
The moment you hurt, it's over.

2926
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:26,080
It's over.

2927
02:30:26,140 --> 02:30:27,320
He has a wife, guys.

2928
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:29,340
Oh, my God.

2929
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:30,200
Bro, that's wild.

2930
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:32,600
Bro, you just met Jose.

2931
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:33,440
Bro.

2932
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:35,060
And he's...

2933
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:38,240
And he's happily married, too.

2934
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:40,420
What's the point?

2935
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:45,660
He's happily married, guy.

2936
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:46,820
Oh, shit, nice!

2937
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,220
Okay.

2938
02:30:48,100 --> 02:30:49,140
We're sending...

2939
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:50,220
It doesn't matter.

2940
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:51,980
I don't care if we're sending you in.

2941
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:52,540
Coffin.

2942
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:56,020
Go do your job!

2943
02:30:56,380 --> 02:30:58,160
I believe in you, coffin!

2944
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:00,420
Alright, it'll be fine.

2945
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:01,820
Coffin will be fine.

2946
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:03,760
Wait, there's a fox nearby?

2947
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:05,060
I was not paying attention.

2948
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:06,980
There's a fox.

2949
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:09,220
I see no fox.

2950
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:11,500
What do they even look like?

2951
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:14,960
Wait, what do the foxes even look like?

2952
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,940
I hear, like, noises here.

2953
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:23,020
The white streaks?

2954
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:23,700
What?

2955
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,260
Oh, I see it!

2956
02:31:26,300 --> 02:31:26,800
I see it!

2957
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:28,280
Is that where the spear fox is?

2958
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:30,640
Okay, give me a sec.

2959
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:33,580
I've been doing a lot of driving games lately.

2960
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:35,220
Oh, I see it!

2961
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:35,880
Is it that?

2962
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:37,480
Oh, I think I see the fox!

2963
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:39,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the little white streaks that's floating.

2964
02:31:41,140 --> 02:31:42,660
Oh my god, it's so fast.

2965
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:44,980
Wait, they're so fast.

2966
02:31:45,620 --> 02:31:46,520
Wait, I lost them.

2967
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:51,580
Wait, he's so fucking fast!

2968
02:31:51,900 --> 02:31:55,200
Oh my god, how do I catch... Okay, we gotta cut him off.

2969
02:31:56,180 --> 02:31:57,420
Nice, we ran over him.

2970
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:58,420
Wait, he got away!

2971
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:00,140
Wait, he fucking got away!

2972
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:07,800
Wait, how do I... How do I catch him?

2973
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:10,880
Wait, they looped.

2974
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:12,080
Wait, he's gonna come back here.

2975
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:14,540
Right here!

2976
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:16,960
Then he, like, jumped over me!

2977
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:20,200
All right.

2978
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:24,860
And then...

2979
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:31,230
Just jumped over me.

2980
02:32:33,630 --> 02:32:35,970
It's like, what!?

2981
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:41,190
They sent down teeth to w- what?!

2982
02:32:44,190 --> 02:32:46,010
Oh, I need to jump.

2983
02:32:46,270 --> 02:32:46,910
Okay, okay.

2984
02:32:47,290 --> 02:32:49,850
Can't jump if I also jump.

2985
02:32:52,970 --> 02:32:53,570
All right.

2986
02:32:54,430 --> 02:32:55,770
All right, don't worry.

2987
02:32:56,030 --> 02:32:56,930
I got this.

2988
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:03,520
He jumped even higher!

2989
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:09,560
Why?

2990
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:12,220
He just jumped higher!

2991
02:33:13,940 --> 02:33:14,420
Okay.

2992
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:16,520
He double jumped.

2993
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:17,900
Wait, that's illegal!

2994
02:33:18,180 --> 02:33:18,620
Okay, don't worry.

2995
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:19,120
I'll come back.

2996
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:20,620
Oh, Kofun needs help!

2997
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:21,300
Kofun!

2998
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:23,240
What happened?

2999
02:33:27,220 --> 02:33:28,240
Kavos are here!

3000
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:33,580
It's Mike Miller.

3001
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:36,740
Welcome to another event livestream, mascot fans.

3002
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:39,080
Oh my god, she has 34 fans watching.

3003
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:41,740
Oh my god, I knew you would be bigger than Tofu.

3004
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:43,980
What's up with this dog?

3005
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:45,140
Looks like he wants to play.

3006
02:33:45,140 --> 02:33:45,220
Okay.

3007
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:47,380
Doesn't it know this is a mascot event?

3008
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:48,640
It's nothing sacred?

3009
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:50,760
The dog wants to play!

3010
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:53,360
The dog wants to play during the goddamn mascot event!

3011
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:54,080
Oh, damn!

3012
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,120
Kofun's a cat!

3013
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:03,140
And I sent him a cat mascot!

3014
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:05,920
Unleash the heroes!

3015
02:34:07,880 --> 02:34:08,640
Noooo!

3016
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:12,400
Dad, no!

3017
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:15,260
Oh, shit.

3018
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:15,600
Okay.

3019
02:34:16,980 --> 02:34:18,400
Um, plus ten.

3020
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,020
Plus fifteen, all right.

3021
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:21,520
Nice.

3022
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:25,740
Guys, I have one remaining action, but I just need to do plus 10.

3023
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:26,840
Here you go.

3024
02:34:27,380 --> 02:34:28,360
This should be enough.

3025
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:28,800
Yes!

3026
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:30,200
Get away from her!

3027
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:36,220
We did it!

3028
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:39,960
The dog just won half...

3029
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:40,360
Whoa!

3030
02:34:40,580 --> 02:34:41,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3031
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:44,910
We're calming him down!

3032
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:45,990
We did it!

3033
02:34:46,070 --> 02:34:47,930
We saved her debut, guys!

3034
02:34:48,870 --> 02:34:50,290
We did it, guys!

3035
02:34:50,570 --> 02:34:51,870
We did it, Kadaris!

3036
02:34:52,130 --> 02:34:53,350
We saved her debut!

3037
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:57,270
Yippee!

3038
02:34:58,170 --> 02:34:58,710
Alright.

3039
02:34:58,850 --> 02:34:59,910
We're going to catch this fox.

3040
02:35:00,150 --> 02:35:00,950
I can do it.

3041
02:35:01,850 --> 02:35:04,470
If it's the last thing I'll do, I'll catch this fox.

3042
02:35:05,150 --> 02:35:06,350
That's my Oshi.

3043
02:35:06,590 --> 02:35:07,110
That's right.

3044
02:35:08,390 --> 02:35:09,950
Her debut is saved.

3045
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:14,990
Like...

3046
02:35:16,350 --> 02:35:16,910
What?!

3047
02:35:16,910 --> 02:35:19,010
She just jumps higher!

3048
02:35:21,530 --> 02:35:24,510
I don't wanna... I don't wanna catch him!

3049
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:29,140
Okay.

3050
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,380
You have to catch him behind?

3051
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:35,560
Oh my god!

3052
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:40,560
I have to catch him from the... I actually have to catch him.

3053
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:41,560
Alright.

3054
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:45,500
Don't worry.

3055
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:46,880
Okay.

3056
02:35:46,880 --> 02:35:51,480
He ain't gonna... He's not gonna get away from me.

3057
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:53,180
That's right.

3058
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:54,320
I did it!

3059
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:55,660
Okay, I had to do it from behind.

3060
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:56,820
I did it!

3061
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:59,860
Okay, Poseidon, call and tell him we found one of his plans.

3062
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:00,920
Okay, we did it, guys.

3063
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:02,620
I had to do it from behind.

3064
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:07,940
Thanks for finding this.

3065
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:09,000
No problem.

3066
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:10,380
What's this one do?

3067
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:12,160
This will give you some extra speed.

3068
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:15,040
Getting more speed out of trucks like yours can be difficult.

3069
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:19,180
However, I came up with a few hose modifications that should get you going faster.

3070
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:20,500
Awesome!

3071
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:25,320
I enjoy leisurely drives as much as the next person, but this truck could do with more juice.

3072
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:27,200
Alright, I'll get it in some.

3073
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:29,680
Yay!

3074
02:36:31,480 --> 02:36:32,760
We got speed!

3075
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:34,900
Oh, and we have more fans!

3076
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:37,700
They heard about my truck being the speediest...

3077
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:40,840
The speediest truck in town.

3078
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,500
Alright, guys.

3079
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:46,040
Alright, let me save real quick.

3080
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,880
I'm gonna call it here, guys.

3081
02:36:48,220 --> 02:36:49,000
Wait, how do I save?

3082
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:50,380
How do I...

3083
02:36:51,020 --> 02:36:51,980
Oh, there we go.

3084
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:52,820
Alright.

3085
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:54,560
We're gonna save...

3086
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:55,580
We're gonna stop it here.

3087
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:56,640
That's fun, though!

3088
02:36:57,260 --> 02:36:58,020
That's fun!

3089
02:36:58,140 --> 02:36:59,760
It's a very interesting game.

3090
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:02,020
It's definitely very narrative-driven.

3091
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:07,080
So, it's definitely a nice change of pace on my other games.

3092
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:09,600
But, my brain's tired from reading.

3093
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:11,400
So, I'm gonna call it here.

3094
02:37:14,180 --> 02:37:15,060
Will you return?

3095
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,800
Yeah, I'll play more of this.

3096
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,480
I don't know if I'll play it all the way to the end.

3097
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:20,400
But, definitely...

3098
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:23,300
I'll try, like, one more part, and then we'll see how I feel.

3099
02:37:23,860 --> 02:37:26,680
And we'll do, like, one more part of this next week.

3100
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:27,780
And then I'll...

3101
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:28,540
Because I'm still...

3102
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:30,920
Because we did a lot of, like, introduction.

3103
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:32,200
Um...

3104
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:33,820
We did a lot of, like, intro to it.

3105
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:35,860
So, now we're actually in the meat of the game.

3106
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:38,120
Like, we're slowly starting to get to the meat of the game.

3107
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:40,540
So, I'm gonna see, like, the second part.

3108
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:43,200
To see, like, how much of the gameplay we get after that.

3109
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:45,240
And then I'll see how I feel.

3110
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:46,900
And I want to keep going with this playthrough.

3111
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:47,720
Um...

3112
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:48,800
But it was very interesting.

3113
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:49,420
Yeah.

3114
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:50,460
It was very interesting.

3115
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:51,680
And being able to, like, you know...

3116
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:53,180
I can start my own VTuber company.

3117
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:54,060
Uh...

3118
02:37:54,060 --> 02:37:54,560
Watch it!

3119
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:55,800
Welcome to Tomato Fire!

3120
02:37:55,900 --> 02:37:56,220
Welcome!

3121
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:56,680
Welcome!

3122
02:37:57,860 --> 02:37:58,220
Uh...

3123
02:37:58,220 --> 02:37:59,480
Next week, they give us Super Chat.

3124
02:37:59,640 --> 02:37:59,780
Thank you.

3125
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:00,200
Thank you.

3126
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:01,900
Thanks for reading all the voices, Doki.

3127
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:03,260
I love hearing you voice act things.

3128
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:04,120
It's a rare treat.

3129
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:04,940
Thank you for the Super Chat.

3130
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:05,240
Thank you.

3131
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:05,740
Thank you.

3132
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,880
Also, cause, like, tomorrow, I also have another game...

3133
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:10,420
Like, I'm playing Super Mario-Mond tomorrow.

3134
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:12,400
And I also need to read a lot for that one.

3135
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:14,780
So, I just want to make sure I rest my voice for tomorrow as well.

3136
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:15,860
Because, you know...

3137
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:16,620
Toad is in it.

3138
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:17,180
And I don't...

3139
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:18,520
I've never done a toad voice.

3140
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:20,380
And I know that's gonna fuck up my voice eventually.

3141
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:21,500
I'm like...

3142
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:21,780
No!

3143
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:22,880
Haha!

3144
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:24,840
That's like...

3145
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:25,420
That's my...

3146
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:26,060
My...

3147
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:27,160
My toad impression.

3148
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:28,780
I'll be like, MARIO!

3149
02:38:32,470 --> 02:38:32,910
So...

3150
02:38:34,810 --> 02:38:35,690
Yeah, so...

3151
02:38:35,690 --> 02:38:37,110
Toad's in the game.

3152
02:38:37,370 --> 02:38:40,530
So I was like, okay, I need to rest my voice for tomorrow's adventure.

3153
02:38:43,630 --> 02:38:45,610
Hey guys, I'm gonna call it here.

3154
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:49,730
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

3155
02:38:50,010 --> 02:38:51,790
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3156
02:38:51,930 --> 02:38:55,630
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

3157
02:38:55,810 --> 02:38:58,510
I'll see you guys tomorrow everybody, or I'll see you guys next time.

3158
02:38:58,510 --> 02:38:59,550
If you're not gonna be there tomorrow.

3159
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:00,570
Bye guys!

3160
02:39:01,130 --> 02:39:01,490
Bye!
