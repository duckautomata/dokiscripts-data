1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
My discord, my, what, my game thingy, my...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,280
Wait, which color was that?

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,640
You got this, you got this.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,560
Guys, I don't think we're beating Pico Park today, I don't...

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,920
We are!

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,860
No, have faith!

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,220
Guys, I don't...

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,380
Am I in red?

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
I'm in red, okay.

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,780
Who's Tungus green head is on my head right now?

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,180
Who is a green head?

12
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,060
Who the fuck is this person on my...

13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,880
Oh, a fucking mid.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,500
I have to look at my...

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,660
I'm looking at the discord overlay.

16
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,640
It's like, okay, orange.

17
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,940
Orange.

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,940
I'm looking orange.

19
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,740
Orange is glad I'm not yellow.

20
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,140
Three collabs in and we're still just calling each other based off of the color.

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,420
The color of your avatar.

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,080
Pick your words wisely, orange.

23
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,800
Alright.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,360
Who was orange?

25
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,640
Just look at your discord overlay.

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,380
Oh yeah, I never changed it.

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,120
Okay, oh wait, that's all of us.

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,360
Wait.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,180
No, wait, no, that's not all of us.

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,640
We're missing two.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,440
I want to get rid of the little hats.

32
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,460
I don't like the little numbers.

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,040
Little hats?

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,040
What?

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,740
You can put hats on you in settings that gives you numbers, so instead of being like purple, blue, you're like one, two, three, four, five.

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,420
What?

37
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,660
Yeah.

38
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,000
You can?

39
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,000
Why did you pick that?

40
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,060
I don't know.

41
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,060
I don't want to get rid of it now.

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,820
Yeah, why do you have that on?

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,100
I don't like it.

44
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,880
I want to get rid of it.

45
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,100
Oh, player number's off.

46
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,600
There we go.

47
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,240
It's in settings.

48
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,240
Oh, so that's cool.

49
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,140
Because last time I played with a different group, we couldn't figure out colors because we were all colorblind.

50
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,420
I think we were Christmas colorblind, so we had to change it.

51
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,680
Is any of us colorblind?

52
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,780
No.

53
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,160
Okay, I wouldn't care anyway, so that's fine.

54
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,980
There's no...

55
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,380
Sorry, there's no accessibility here.

56
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,060
We're good, we're good.

57
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,660
There's no...

58
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,780
Now we're just little guys.

59
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,400
Nice.

60
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,340
All right.

61
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,500
Two, four, six.

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,280
We're missing one.

63
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
Who's the last one?

64
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,820
Not me, man.

65
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,100
Is it Snuffy?

66
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,120
I think it's Snuffy.

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah, yeah, Snuffy.

68
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,080
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,040
He needed a sec.

70
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,220
Sorry, sorry.

71
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,680
I'm trying to speed it up.

72
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:21,900
You're good!

73
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,120
You're good!

74
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,500
You're good!

75
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,040
You're good!

76
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,120
You're good!

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,140
You're good!

78
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,040
It's all right.

79
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,400
I wasn't the one that called you out, so it's okay.

80
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,760
It was a loving call out because I always notice when Snuffy isn't here because she lights up my life and the room.

81
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,300
Aww!

82
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,140
Aww!

83
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,880
What does that say about us?

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,980
The rest...

85
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,580
All right, we just gotta...

86
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,120
Don't worry, this room is set to maximum seven, so no one extra...

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
Oh, perfect.

88
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,180
Hey, since we're one short, surely we'd be better at the game now, right?

89
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,040
Is that how it works?

90
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,540
I believe.

91
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,320
Yeah, because there's less people to coordinate with.

92
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,100
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,460
So then we should be...

94
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,640
That's optimistic.

95
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,500
But to be fair, Rin was one of our brain cells, so that's also an issue.

96
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,100
Her brain cells canceled out Amelie's brain cells, so now it's like...

97
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,740
We're like the damn.

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,380
Damn.

99
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,100
Okay, so...

100
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,640
We're talking against ourselves today.

101
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,400
We're screwed.

102
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,800
So, all right.

103
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,760
So that means everything is on Lime then.

104
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,740
Lime, this is it.

105
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,400
This is your...

106
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,120
No pressure there.

107
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,820
Your time to shine.

108
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,520
No pressure there.

109
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,920
Lime, save us, Lime.

110
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,900
Lime, save us, Lime.

111
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,800
Lime, save us, Lime.

112
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,660
You almost won the Wheel of Fortune and you didn't even know the game, right?

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,060
You gotta save us.

114
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,520
All right, we're in.

115
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:48,880
I got you.

116
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,120
I got you.

117
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,920
It's gonna be great.

118
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,580
Okay, start game.

119
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,760
All right.

120
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,800
Oh, look at all these things we beat, guys.

121
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
Oh, now it's time for Time Limit, everybody.

122
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,780
Oh, boy.

123
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,460
I don't know about all that.

124
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
Oh, boy.

125
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,940
We just got here.

126
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,020
What about some warm up?

127
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,360
Oh, you want warm up?

128
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,260
Okay.

129
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,480
These ones look fun.

130
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
Last part.

131
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,580
We did that one.

132
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,220
Oh, okay.

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,700
Okay.

134
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,600
Okay, let's warm up, guys.

135
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,160
Oh, what just happened?

136
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,340
Huh?

137
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,860
Huh?

138
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,320
Oh.

139
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,260
Oh.

140
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,540
Oh.

141
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:24,980
What the?

142
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,580
What?

143
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,840
Wait, what's happening?

144
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,780
Oh.

145
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,320
Oh.

146
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,900
It's like red light, green light.

147
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,620
Oh, gosh.

148
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh, wait.

149
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,840
Oh, no.

150
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,540
Oh.

151
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,080
We can't.

152
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,140
Let's go back.

153
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,680
You know what?

154
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,860
Let's go somewhere else.

155
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,560
This place sucks.

156
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,220
Yeah.

157
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,580
Yeah.

158
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,560
Yeah.

159
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,520
Yeah.

160
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah.

161
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:44,960
Yeah.

162
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,440
Yeah.

163
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,220
Yeah.

164
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay.

165
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,540
Press space.

166
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,920
Press X button to use skill.

167
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,380
Oh.

168
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,540
Oh, I've become cube.

169
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,620
Oh.

170
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,720
Oh.

171
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh.

172
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,060
Watch it.

173
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,660
I can kill people.

174
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:55,980
Oh.

175
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,580
Oh.

176
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,160
Space to use skill.

177
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,040
Oh, we just...

178
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,300
And then we push them.

179
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
Push them to the button so I can make you into a cube.

180
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,540
Oh, okay.

181
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,860
Oh, if you shoot someone, you become a cube.

182
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,620
Yeah.

183
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,200
And then somebody...

184
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,740
I become a cube.

185
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,120
Oh, we have to put one cube on the left side and one cube on the right.

186
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,200
I see.

187
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,240
We have to protect us.

188
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,920
Yeah, you're the protection.

189
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,500
You gotta be protection!

190
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,980
Be careful!

191
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,580
Alright, somebody has to press the button.

192
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,060
Okay, how do we get them out of cube form?

193
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,440
How do you un-cube them?

194
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Oh, just move, okay.

195
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,720
Oh, just move.

196
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,600
It doesn't work!

197
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,500
It doesn't work!

198
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,920
Oh, it's space!

199
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,400
We've been hexed!

200
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,860
Oh, it's space, okay.

201
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,780
How do we get them outside?

202
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
Oh, cube on here!

203
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,360
Yeah, that's gonna break for sure.

204
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,740
I didn't know!

205
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,920
I was gonna die regardless.

206
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,740
I was on the platform.

207
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,880
Wait, we have to use cube people as the bridge?

208
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,680
Make the bridge out of people?

209
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,480
Oh!

210
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,560
Make the bridge out of people?

211
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,740
Doggy!

212
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,920
What are you doing?

213
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,580
I didn't die!

214
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,480
You pressed the button!

215
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,560
Nah, you have no proof.

216
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,040
My lawyer says I didn't.

217
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,080
Just cube me.

218
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,260
Somebody cube before we press it!

219
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,580
I've been cubed, I've been cubed.

220
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Okay, we have...

221
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,700
Alright, defend.

222
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,420
Yeah, press.

223
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,580
Now un-cube.

224
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,520
Nice.

225
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
We're a bridge.

226
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,980
I'm bridge one.

227
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,920
Who did that though, still?

228
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,860
Somebody cube me before I die.

229
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,860
Cube me first.

230
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,880
Maybe we have to platform across it.

231
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,680
Wait, hold on a second.

232
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,900
Do cubes maintain their height?

233
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,280
I think so, yeah.

234
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,920
So everyone just maintain...

235
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,700
You maintain your height.

236
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,500
So people have to make a bridge.

237
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,140
And someone's gonna hop over and get the button.

238
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,180
And someone's gonna hop over and get the button.

239
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,860
I'm stepping stone bridge.

240
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,300
Okay, who's good at parkour?

241
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,480
Who has watched parkour civilization?

242
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,520
Not yet.

243
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,460
Not yet.

244
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
I don't understand.

245
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,440
I only know something about the beef and chicken.

246
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,920
Yeah, beef and chicken.

247
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,020
Don't worry, I got this.

248
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,140
I watched parkour civilization the entire movie.

249
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
You can jump up this far for spacing.

250
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,660
Okay.

251
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,140
I got this.

252
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,300
I think we need to space it out.

253
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,960
We definitely got this.

254
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,620
We need to space a cube between the red arrows.

255
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,340
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,320
We need to space them for this key.

257
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,060
Alright, and then...

258
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,440
I'll just stay here.

259
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,860
Okay, and then I'll do this.

260
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
I'm gonna cube.

261
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,100
Okay.

262
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,120
I can't jump from here.

263
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,360
Guys, I might have watched parkour civilization, but I'm not that good.

264
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,120
You're our leader.

265
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,020
You have to walk in, bro.

266
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,180
There aren't enough spaces.

267
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,920
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,620
I think you two have to spread out.

269
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,340
Spread out a little bit.

270
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,360
Does the key fall?

271
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,440
We just need to get the key.

272
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,960
We don't have to care about this.

273
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,880
The key will fall, so someone has to be underneath it.

274
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,680
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,620
Okay.

276
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,940
I don't think we need this.

277
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,140
We don't need...

278
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,980
I don't think you need to be here, because we just need to get the key.

279
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,940
I can just press the button from here.

280
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,480
No, no, no.

281
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,080
Because once the button's pressed, I'm not sure...

282
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,780
How do we make it?

283
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,680
The blocks might fall.

284
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,900
We'll test it out.

285
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,540
How do we...

286
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,260
When we unbox, what do we do?

287
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,100
Maybe it's a timer.

288
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay, let's find out.

289
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,420
Yeah, let's find out.

290
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,440
Somebody needs to be on top of a cube.

291
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:02,780
Somebody needs to be on top of a cube.

292
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,160
I cannot shoot you for some reason.

293
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,680
There we go.

294
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,780
That's a pretty big jump.

295
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,400
Okay, good luck.

296
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,760
Wait, are we letting...

297
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
Wait, we're letting...

298
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,860
She's going for the key!

300
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,640
Okay, now what?

301
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,020
Okay, now what?

302
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Wait, wait, wait!

303
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,860
What if you go back?

304
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,060
What if you go on the other side?

305
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,400
Oh, that's true.

306
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
Is there another button?

307
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,140
Is there another button?

308
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Risk it all just to find out!

309
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,800
Oh my god!

310
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,980
She's going for the key!

311
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,560
Doki, I think you're going to have to move a little bit.

312
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,380
Don't worry, I got you guys.

313
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,880
Oh my god.

314
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,700
I can't move anymore.

315
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,580
Doki, get the beef!

316
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,340
Okay, now what?

317
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,880
There's no beef.

318
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh, okay.

319
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,100
I guess you could just do that.

320
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,460
I wanted Doki to die with me.

321
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,340
Jump just in time!

322
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,060
Jump just in time!

323
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,380
Okay, okay.

324
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:15,900
I think...

325
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,840
Okay, and we got...

326
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,320
What if we use the...

327
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,840
The boxes as shields?

328
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,480
For the spikes?

329
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,720
So they don't damage the bridge.

330
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,400
Oh, is it the spikes that break the bridge?

331
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,400
Oh, it might be.

332
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,220
Whoa!

333
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,460
Look at that!

334
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,560
Our brains...

335
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Maybe we're just mourning brain cells.

336
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,620
Maybe we should clean in the morning.

337
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,880
This is our warm up.

338
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,800
It's like game one.

339
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,720
Okay, okay.

340
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
You're going to defend that and then...

341
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,760
Alright, we're all safe.

342
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,500
Alright, let's go.

343
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,060
Find an arrow!

344
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
Parkour civilization, let's go!

345
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,860
Get under the spike!

346
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,720
Oh my god, we're so smart.

347
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,280
Okay.

348
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,040
Okay.

349
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,620
That was good.

350
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,520
Somebody shoot me!

351
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,620
I think, Mint, you need to be slightly to the right.

352
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,820
To the right, okay.

353
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,520
Wait, who are we?

354
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Alright, Snuffy, do you want to...

355
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,000
Alright, Snuffy, are you ready to be the parkour person?

356
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:15,780
I was just...

357
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,760
I was realizing that this technique, you have to catch the key, right?

358
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,740
No, there's still one more!

359
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,540
There's still one more arrow!

360
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,660
The bridge won't break.

361
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,500
Oh, okay.

362
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,260
Just that one, on the right.

363
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,700
No, I believe in you, Snuffy.

364
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,160
Just don't go for the beast.

365
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,480
Just don't go for the beast, Snuffy.

366
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,740
What if he needs to be a box?

367
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,460
What if he needs to be a box?

368
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,300
Shoot me!

369
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,580
You're so close!

370
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,600
You're so close to me!

371
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,560
Jump!

372
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,140
Jump and shoot!

373
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,120
I have to jump to the other side!

374
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,240
You have to jump regardless!

375
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,240
Yay!

376
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,880
It worked!

377
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,240
Yay!

378
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,740
We did it!

379
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,020
Oh my god.

380
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,020
We over thought that one a lot, I think.

381
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,280
We over thought that one a lot, I think.

382
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,040
Yeah, we did not do the parkour.

383
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,740
We deserved that.

384
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,200
We tried really hard.

385
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,340
I think we big brained it the first time.

386
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:10,780
I think we big brained it the first time.

387
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,740
Honestly, yeah.

388
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Let's just keep going.

389
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,240
We're 14.

390
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,640
We got this.

391
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,780
We got this coming.

392
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
Oh, this is it.

393
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,060
Oh, it's whack-a-mole!

394
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,040
There's more people!

395
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,400
Oh, we got whack seven!

396
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,600
Okay.

397
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,760
Oh!

398
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,540
Okay, that's fine.

399
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,000
We don't die.

400
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,660
We don't die.

401
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,100
There's big ones!

402
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,000
Watch out to not get hit, I think.

403
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
We don't die though.

404
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh!

405
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,940
I need a second person to help!

406
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,860
Oh, he's gone.

407
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,240
Don't worry, I got you.

408
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,840
Oh, I'm kinda bad at this.

409
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,520
Who's yellow?

410
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,720
Not me.

411
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,420
Wow.

412
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
We need to do it in a row.

413
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,100
Get it.

414
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,240
Do we have to time this?

415
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,700
You need to come back over here first.

416
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,940
It's in a row.

417
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,860
So we need to perfectly do this one first.

418
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,360
Whose corpse is on me?

419
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,260
Someone get blue!

420
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,880
Someone get that one!

421
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,860
Get the girl!

422
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,640
Oh, no!

423
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,360
Okay, one, two, three, four...

424
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,300
Help!

425
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,600
Help!

426
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:16,780
Red!

427
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,180
Yeah, yeah.

428
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,460
Okay, nice, nice.

429
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,980
Nice, nice, nice.

430
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,060
One more!

431
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,400
One more!

432
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,600
One more!

433
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,110
Okay, one.

434
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,850
Okay, we got this.

435
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,770
Look, we're learning how to count.

436
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,170
Okay, now double.

437
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,070
Okay, we both used our cooldown!

438
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,130
We both used our cooldown!

439
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,350
Okay, got it, got it.

440
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,390
I got it, I got it.

441
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,610
Good job, everybody.

442
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,550
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

443
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,570
Everyone should be on a trampoline.

444
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,650
Okay, guys.

445
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,570
Guys, pick one.

446
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,070
One at a time, everybody.

447
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,650
Oh, god.

448
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,810
I got my man.

449
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,790
My little guy.

450
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,470
Okay, I got my little guy.

451
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,570
I got my guy here, too.

452
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,970
You go ahead.

453
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,670
You go ahead.

454
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,750
If you want to head over.

455
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,330
Okay.

456
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:04,890
Okay.

457
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:05,830
Alright.

458
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,590
We can do this.

459
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,450
I believe in us.

460
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,790
Yes, man.

461
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,210
I almost.

462
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:11,690
Okay.

463
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,370
Orange, can you go to the next one?

464
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,030
Yeah.

465
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:14,950
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,810
Thank you, thank you.

467
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,690
I got you.

468
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,390
Got him.

469
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,030
Alright.

470
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,450
We're doing the countdown.

471
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,390
Do the countdown thing.

472
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,530
Oh.

473
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,210
Okay.

474
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,130
Okay.

475
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,030
I guess we just need to speed them up.

476
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,450
Okay.

477
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,010
Okay.

478
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm pretty sure we do this all at once, don't we?

479
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,230
Yeah.

480
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,010
Yeah, I think so.

481
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,590
All at once?

482
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,910
Do we have to... Oh, what's the...

484
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,110
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

485
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,490
The countdown.

486
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,310
Three, two, one.

487
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,070
Oh, okay.

488
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,570
Okay.

489
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,910
Okay.

490
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,690
Okay.

491
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,530
Okay.

492
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:57,530
Okay.

493
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:57,910
Next one?

494
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,490
Oh, shit.

495
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:58,750
Alright.

496
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,890
Let's wait.

497
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,530
We can coordinate this.

498
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,470
Okay.

499
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,530
The moment it goes up, we punch it.

500
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,070
Okay?

501
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:08,990
Okay.

502
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,410
Okay.

503
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,490
I thought on the next...

504
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,430
Okay, on the next... No, I'm weird.

505
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,890
Okay, on the one...

506
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

507
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:19,730
Okay.

508
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,850
The next one.

509
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,190
Hit!

510
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:24,890
Hit!

511
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh, so close!

512
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

513
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,960
Stop it.

514
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,800
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

515
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,540
Okay.

516
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm ready.

517
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

518
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:38,860
Okay.

519
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,420
Next one.

520
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,940
This one, this one.

521
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,340
Right here.

522
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:40,880
One.

523
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,110
I'm sorry.

524
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,110
Okay.

525
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,070
The one after this.

526
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,250
Oh, okay.

527
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,690
Never mind.

528
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,390
Two.

529
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,990
One.

530
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,570
Go!

531
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,030
Wait, who is it?

532
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,410
That was me.

533
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,890
Hold on, hold on.

534
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,830
Okay, okay, okay.

535
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,850
I'm ready for the next one.

536
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,210
One.

537
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,550
Go!

538
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,430
No!

539
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,310
I pressed my button even though it was in the wrong place.

540
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,070
Three, two, one.

541
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,530
Go!

542
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,890
I missed it.

543
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,350
How did you miss it?

544
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,710
Three, two, one.

545
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,110
Yes!

546
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,090
Go!

547
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,110
Yay!

548
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,670
Yay!

549
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,050
We got stuck!

550
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,510
Oh, okay.

551
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,870
Oh, that's all of us.

552
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,770
We all have to punch it.

553
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,830
Yeah, we do have to punch it.

554
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,850
I think we all have to punch it.

555
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

556
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,150
Punch them.

557
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,430
We have to like...

558
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,870
Stack, yeah.

559
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,470
Stack, stack.

560
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

561
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,530
Hold on, let me just...

562
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,910
Is it over?

563
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,670
I'm getting over?

564
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,090
Don't get hit by him.

566
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,590
Oh, nice.

567
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,630
Wait, what?

568
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,710
Oh, do it again, do it again.

569
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,370
Oh, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it.

570
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,490
We looked at it.

571
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,190
We're just like, what happened?

572
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,330
Nice, okay.

573
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,370
Yay!

574
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,250
Yay!

575
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,970
Yay!

576
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,670
It was so easy.

577
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,070
Oh my god, the single brain cell working overtime.

578
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,790
I love that there's ping in the left corner.

579
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,530
Has anyone seen that?

580
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,690
Oh my god.

581
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,230
Why is that not relevant?

582
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,370
Why is the ping relevant in Niko Park?

583
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,890
Because people gotta complain, blame it on something.

584
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,430
Guys, my ping is like 50 right now.

585
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,210
I don't know if this is playable.

586
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,390
It's blocked then.

587
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,870
Shoot me.

588
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,670
Okay.

589
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,430
Everybody box up.

590
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,890
Minus one dent.

591
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,230
Guys, alright.

592
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,290
Who's ready to shoot me?

593
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,850
We need box hats.

594
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,450
Okay, get right here.

595
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,350
Okay.

596
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,950
We need to wear each other.

597
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,590
We need to wear each other.

598
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,070
I'll bait the thing.

599
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,470
We gotta bait it.

600
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,450
Okay, watch this.

601
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,550
Okay, not that.

602
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,430
Okay, not that.

603
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,910
Okay, never mind, let's just do hats.

604
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,870
Okay, never mind, let's just do hats.

605
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,910
Wow, what?

606
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,710
Why?

607
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,970
Wow, what?

608
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,370
Why?

609
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,330
I thought you guys needed...

610
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,390
Okay, one person will have no hat.

611
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,310
But that's okay.

612
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,830
Okay, actually...

613
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,870
Oh, we can't.

614
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,350
You can't wear them.

615
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,830
Okay, I baited it.

616
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,930
Okay, I still touched it.

617
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,250
What did you do?

618
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,510
I ran against it.

619
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,230
I stubbed my toe.

620
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,050
Okay, watch this.

621
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,830
There you go.

622
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,150
There you go.

623
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,450
There, just don't stub your toe.

624
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:36,790
Okay.

625
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,190
Okay, but then what do we do after?

626
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:41,550
Oh my god.

627
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,090
What do we do after?

628
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,130
Wait, it'll stop on it, right?

629
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,110
Like, we can just keep walking, right?

630
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,410
Yeah, yeah.

631
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,250
So I was like, what?

632
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,490
And then we have someone at the end Somebody got impatient.

633
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,010
Guys, guys!

634
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,390
Oh!

635
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,970
It was me!

636
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,210
I jumped.

637
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,570
I was trying to shoot Doki.

638
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,070
Okay.

639
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,610
Okay.

640
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,070
Dukes, dukes.

641
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,030
Somebody shoot her.

642
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,070
Okay, nice.

643
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,890
Alright, now everybody just walk underneath.

644
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,570
Don't get impatient, guys.

645
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,950
Wait, wait, wait.

646
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,390
Somebody should go here now so they have all the time in the world to walk.

647
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,730
Oh!

648
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,410
Bro, how?

649
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,730
I appreciate the sacrifice.

650
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,910
We go in the ladder.

651
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,410
I scream.

652
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,190
It'll happen!

653
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,310
Okay, okay, okay.

654
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,590
I just needed to get my brain matched.

655
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,290
Easy!

656
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,710
I'm good, I'm good.

657
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,130
This is a good lobotomy.

658
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,890
Okay, okay.

659
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,130
Alright, someone get on me and become cu- Okay.

660
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,950
Alright, nice.

661
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,730
Alright, we go forward.

662
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,730
Now someone become a cube down here.

663
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,710
Okay, um...

664
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,210
Shoot.

665
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,390
Ah!

666
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,030
You have to say something!

667
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,570
Shoot!

668
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:10,970
Shoot!

669
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,590
I said shoot.

670
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,290
That was enough.

671
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,410
We need a Doki death counter.

672
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,230
What did I do?

673
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,690
That was my first death.

674
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,190
That was my first death right there.

675
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,630
That was my first death.

676
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,890
Okay, okay.

677
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,970
Okay, become cube.

678
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,570
I'm scared!

679
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:31,870
Okay.

680
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,490
Oh!

681
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,430
Okay, cube death.

682
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,410
Sorry, wait.

683
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,510
Wait, Val.

684
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,350
There we go.

685
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,310
Okay.

686
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,290
Wait, I can't go under!

687
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,830
We're stuck!

688
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,670
Wait!

689
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,970
You guys are stuck!

690
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,790
I have to save you guys!

691
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,530
You guys are stuck!

692
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,990
I was saving everyone!

693
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,630
I'm a hero!

694
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm a hero.

695
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,230
I'll save you, Doki!

696
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,750
Wait, I'm out!

697
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,630
Okay, shoot me.

698
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,410
There we go.

699
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,230
Okay.

700
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,090
Now someone becomes a cube.

701
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,410
Now that I'm so far away, you can't blame me.

702
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,190
Are you ready to shoot?

703
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,470
Do you have your finger on the trigger?

704
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,150
Are you ready?

705
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:21,850
We have one chance.

706
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,510
Go, go, go!

707
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,430
Nice, nice, nice.

708
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

709
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,330
And now I don't fuck it up!

711
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,070
See!

712
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,790
It wasn't me!

713
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,650
I literally stood there and did nothing!

714
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,610
I was literally about to say, now I don't fuck it up!

715
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,430
Alright.

716
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,630
Who's gonna shoot?

717
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,210
Who's gonna shoot?

718
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,250
Are you ready?

719
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:47,770
I got it.

720
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,350
I don't think they were ready, guys.

721
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,710
I need one second.

722
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,170
One second.

723
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,750
I'm gonna make a fucking difference.

724
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,510
Oh, wait.

725
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,870
How did she die?

726
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,670
How did she die?

727
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,970
You got shot with a real gun!

728
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,450
What happened?

729
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,970
I'm telling you, there's I had a fucking aneurysm.

730
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,150
Alright, don't worry.

731
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,050
We got this.

732
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,290
I believe...

733
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,930
Okay, who's gonna...

734
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,750
I'm gonna be here so you guys can't...

735
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,490
Oh, no.

736
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,390
Oh, no.

737
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,070
Just keep funneling into the...

738
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,090
Alright, I'm gonna stay in here so nobody can blame me.

739
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,310
It's not my fault if I'm all the way here.

740
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,030
Okay, nice.

741
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,830
Go, go, go, go.

742
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,750
Get your blocking butt out of the way.

743
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,270
Okay.

744
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,190
Not me.

745
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,770
Not me.

746
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,590
Okay, ready?

747
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,210
What if I unblock right now?

748
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,790
Okay.

749
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,170
Stay right.

750
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,670
Just stay right there.

751
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,010
Okay.

752
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,690
Get up, get up, get up.

753
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,510
Nice, nice, nice.

754
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,170
What do we do here?

755
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,050
Is this...

756
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,310
We got a parkour.

757
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,030
It's real stiff now.

758
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,230
Oh, it is.

759
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,790
It's parkour.

760
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,490
No, no, no.

761
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,030
Don't say that.

762
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,310
Okay, and then...

763
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,030
Do we make a bridge?

764
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,830
Somebody has to...

765
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,530
Okay, who has a good shot?

766
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,390
I'm gonna go up.

767
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,070
I'm gonna jump.

768
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,210
Okay, never mind.

769
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,150
What do you mean you're gonna jump?

770
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,390
What do you mean you're gonna jump?

771
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,790
We're gonna make a bridge.

772
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,270
Okay, who wants to make...

773
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,970
Oh yeah, there is a ledge over there.

774
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,870
Somebody shoot.

775
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,190
Somebody shoot the staircase.

776
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:39,730
Which one?

777
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,410
Which one?

778
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,410
I think we can shoot...

779
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,110
I feel like we need our platform a little longer.

780
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,050
Can we make like a platform?

781
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,390
Like a human platform?

782
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,350
Oh, maybe.

783
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,810
We'll all fall though, right?

784
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,290
Okay, maybe we shoot bow and then we can...

785
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,830
And then we can...

786
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,150
Can we climb?

787
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,570
Yeah, yeah, we can...

788
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,610
Yeah, but if we freeze people over the gap then they die when they...

789
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,010
They can't come back, right?

790
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,070
I think that's the key.

791
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,270
I think that's where the key is.

792
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,730
We just need to grab the key on the other side.

793
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,090
But there's no way you can make this jump because there's like...

794
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,250
There's like a platform right above us.

795
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,070
Maybe if someone steps off and then as they're falling we shoot?

796
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:13,810
Yeah.

797
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,630
Oh, maybe.

798
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,490
Alright, if we all three of us shoot then we'll hit...

799
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,290
One of us will hit her.

800
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:19,910
Okay.

802
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,950
Do a countdown.

803
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,810
Okay.

804
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,710
Okay, ready?

805
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,650
No, we're never getting her back.

806
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,790
We are never getting her back.

807
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,410
She is gone.

808
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,550
She is gone.

809
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,130
She's not coming back.

810
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:53,530
Don't hate me, but I'm going to test something.

811
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,810
I'm going to test something.

812
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,940
We are going to test something.

813
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,380
Oh my God!

814
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,820
Yeah!

815
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,560
We timed it so well.

816
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,980
Okay.

817
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,300
This is so easy then.

818
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,140
Wait, we need someone to block over there.

819
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,120
Someone will jump and turn you into a cube.

820
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,100
No, just kidding.

821
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,180
Okay, no.

822
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,760
We did it.

823
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,420
Stop killing me!

824
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,800
I don't wanna be cute!

825
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,360
Okay, somebody has to...

826
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,660
Okay, awesome.

827
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,740
Thank you, Doki.

828
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,020
Oh, there's more.

829
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,320
We have to get everyone over?

830
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,340
Okay, somebody has to give me a platform.

831
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,300
No, I like the way we...

832
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,760
How do we become cubes?

833
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,220
There we go, yay!

834
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,000
Just come back when you feel like it.

835
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,520
Doki, can you jump?

836
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,880
Wait, why me?

837
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,600
Can you just come to my platform?

838
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,020
Okay.

839
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,560
Now it's your turn to jump.

840
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,300
I didn't miss.

841
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,830
There you go.

842
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,390
You have to time that shit.

843
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,310
How do you do the timer?

844
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,910
A tab and it's at the very bottom.

845
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,650
Okay, you gotta jump.

846
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,150
We may not have left ourselves with enough people.

847
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:26,910
It's fine.

848
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,070
Okay, wait, wait.

849
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,510
Keep jumping.

850
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,110
Why is Bao on the way over there?

851
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,070
Cause we needed that extra platform.

852
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,410
No, you don't!

853
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,870
No, you don't!

854
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,650
I did.

855
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,450
Oh, we need one more.

856
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,310
Yeah, yeah.

857
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,650
I think about...

858
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,270
Okay.

859
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,390
I told you.

860
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,430
No, it's cause we don't need those two blocks close to each other.

861
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:50,850
You got this.

862
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,610
Okay.

863
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,930
Alright, now we gotta figure this out again.

864
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,050
Alright, shoot.

865
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,270
Wait, I can't.

866
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,430
I can pick up.

867
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,090
Nice.

868
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,130
And then what?

869
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,270
And then jump.

870
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,210
Okay, we gotta make one extra platform then.

871
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,690
I'll do it closer.

872
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,270
How about here?

873
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,990
How about here?

874
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,190
Yeah!

875
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,550
And then we just need one person to make it through.

876
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,270
I need...

877
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,770
Okay, I need you to shoot me.

878
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,210
I think.

879
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,030
You shoot me, you shoot me.

880
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:24,790
What?

881
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,210
Shoot you?

882
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,250
Well, you need to get off my head.

883
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,630
Actually, you know what?

884
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,570
You can do whatever you want.

885
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,570
I'll shoot you.

886
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,870
I missed.

887
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,150
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

888
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,310
Okay.

889
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,510
Wait, we have...

890
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,130
Maybe we just push this closer.

891
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,550
No, no.

892
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,750
Okay, I was gonna say.

893
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,230
We can push Lime closer.

894
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:47,650
What's up?

895
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,930
Just chillin'.

896
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,450
Jump and shoot.

897
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,470
I'm sorry.

898
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,110
I'm sorry.

899
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,350
Three, two, one.

900
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,070
Go!

901
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,690
Wait, why did you jump?

902
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,770
I don't know.

903
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,150
I was trying to get it high.

904
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,590
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

905
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,370
You got this.

906
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,230
Yay!

907
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,450
Okay.

908
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,190
Okay, you gotta do here.

909
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,090
Alright, get over here.

910
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,310
And then...

911
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,970
You actually didn't need that extra person after all.

912
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,250
Go, go, go.

913
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:21,870
We did it!

914
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,070
Ain't no way, bro.

915
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,030
Ain't no way.

916
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,990
Ain't no way, bro.

917
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,870
Ain't no way, bro.

918
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,570
I think we should freeze Amelie right here.

919
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,650
Yeah, we have Amelie.

920
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,790
Amelie, you're good.

921
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,210
Amelie, don't go there.

922
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,450
Alright, Amelie.

923
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,730
You stay right there, Amelie.

924
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,010
Amelie, don't move.

925
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,210
Amelie, did you play Pico?

926
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,630
Amelie.

927
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:06,930
Amelie.

928
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,250
You know the worst part?

929
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,510
Amelie has the most experience in Pico Park 2 out of all of us.

930
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,970
How many hours?

931
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,050
How many hours do you spend?

932
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,010
What's your ping at?

933
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,830
Yeah, what's your ping?

934
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,790
What's your ping?

935
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,190
I think I know who...

936
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,570
Who's the reason why we have a ping difference.

937
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,130
Yeah.

938
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,470
I don't get out of the way of the door, so I don't be in the door's way.

939
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,270
I don't block the door from the key person.

940
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,790
There are tears of pain in my eyes right now.

941
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,610
Tears of pain.

942
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,090
You don't understand.

943
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,850
There are tears of pain.

944
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:49,850
Alright.

945
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,070
Oh my god.

946
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,530
Here we go again.

947
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,250
Does that work?

948
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,010
No, okay, I don't want me to...

949
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,530
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

950
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,630
I was too far.

951
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,030
It's so over.

952
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,750
I was too far.

953
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,670
I'm just gonna stay here.

954
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:12,610
You know what?

955
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,510
You know what?

956
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,490
Thanks for inviting me here.

957
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,030
What are you doing?

958
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,110
Who do they blame?

959
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,910
The team or do they blame the coach?

960
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:23,690
Shoot!

961
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,490
Oh, okay.

962
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,430
That works.

963
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,410
Doki, come on.

964
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,330
I'm heading over.

965
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,390
I don't want people to blame me.

966
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,930
If I don't move, if I don't do anything, you can't fucking blame me.

967
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,970
Okay, who's gonna...

968
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,090
Ready?

969
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,790
On the next one.

970
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:45,970
Oh.

971
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,810
Guys, we give her nothing.

972
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,910
I'm not doing anything.

973
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,270
I'm gonna become the Joker.

974
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,590
You stay here.

975
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,250
This is your time out corner.

976
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,310
I'm gonna start barking.

977
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,130
This is your time out corner.

978
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,590
I was crazy.

979
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,790
They put me in a room full of blocks.

980
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,630
Why are you moving?

981
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:08,970
I'm leaving you.

982
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,470
Go over there.

983
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:12,970
Wait, who's hot?

984
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,570
That works too.

985
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:14,990
I'll be hot.

986
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,490
Shoot me!

987
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,390
Okay, Amelie, come over.

988
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,550
Come here, Amelie.

989
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,370
Come over here.

990
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,770
Don't jump.

991
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:24,910
Don't jump.

992
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,290
Amelie, get over here.

993
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,330
Amelie, get into this corner.

994
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,730
Amelie, I need you in this corner.

995
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,130
Okay, there you go.

996
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:32,830
Give me a box.

997
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,970
We should get closer.

998
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,370
Okay.

999
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:39,950
Nice.

1000
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:40,690
Okay.

1001
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,830
It's okay.

1002
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,530
She's a box.

1003
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,610
She can't do no harm.

1004
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,330
She's a box.

1005
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,370
Amelie, you're the first box.

1006
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,310
Get over here.

1007
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,410
You're gonna be the first box.

1008
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,170
Move.

1009
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:53,670
Go on.

1010
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,930
Are you ready?

1011
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,110
I think we should give her the key so she doesn't walk further than the door.

1012
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,110
Okay, but then what if she... Oh, that's true.

1013
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:02,930
That's true.

1014
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,110
Okay, Amelie, get over here.

1015
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,170
You're not the box anymore.

1016
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,570
Alright, here you go.

1017
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,150
You stay here.

1018
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,610
Look at the thing.

1019
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,690
It's not moving now.

1020
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,550
We're perfectly unstuck together.

1021
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,030
Yay!

1022
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,170
Yes!

1023
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,050
Okay, one of us has to shoot.

1024
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,110
Amino acids are the building blocks of the...

1025
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,850
Okay.

1026
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,190
...of our soul.

1027
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,410
Oh, nice shot!

1028
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,930
Alright, we just need one more person over here.

1029
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,990
Two people.

1030
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:40,970
We need two people.

1031
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,570
I'm on my way.

1032
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,990
Okay, Amelie, get up.

1033
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,710
Okay, stop there.

1034
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,490
Stop there, Amelie.

1035
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,390
Stop there.

1036
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,930
Jump on my head.

1037
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,150
Nothing can go wrong.

1038
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,690
Okay, you need to jump a little bit.

1039
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,450
Me?

1040
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1041
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,630
Oh, okay.

1042
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,710
Okay, there you go.

1043
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:01,370
Okay.

1044
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,170
No, we actually...

1045
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:04,770
Do you need me?

1046
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,730
We need two people.

1047
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:06,930
Yeah.

1048
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,870
So you guys have to unbox and then try and figure out a better platform.

1049
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,730
Wait, wait, wait.

1050
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,670
Can you jump on the...

1051
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,290
Oh, wait, never mind.

1052
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,810
Here, can someone shoot me?

1053
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,630
Oh, shoot you?

1054
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,190
Okay, okay.

1055
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:20,610
There we go.

1056
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,790
Oh, wait, can you reach...

1057
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,410
You can shoot me.

1058
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,090
You can shoot me.

1059
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,210
I think that's maybe a bit high.

1060
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,410
Maybe a bit high.

1061
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,170
Oh, there we go.

1062
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,790
That's fine.

1063
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,250
That's fine.

1064
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:30,970
Okay.

1065
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,350
Alright, Amelie, you go up.

1066
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,870
Amelie, you go up on me and then there we go.

1067
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,610
And then you go on top of...

1068
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,910
There we go.

1069
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,890
We did it!

1070
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:42,610
Redemption!

1071
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:44,930
Redemption!

1072
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,370
Redemption!

1073
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:45,550
Redemption!

1074
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,630
Wait, stop.

1075
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,670
Stop moving.

1076
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,690
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1077
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,890
I'm not...

1078
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,750
Nobody is going past this door.

1079
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:55,950
Wait.

1080
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:56,870
Wait.

1081
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,570
Bow.

1082
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:58,950
Bow.

1083
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,450
Bow.

1084
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,610
Don't go.

1085
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,550
Don't do it, Snuffy.

1086
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,070
Don't do it.

1087
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,350
You know what?

1088
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,370
We can all cue me.

1089
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,630
I was taking permanent effect.

1090
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,850
I was like becoming the cube.

1091
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,670
She was full cube.

1092
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,070
But I just kept staring at the cube.

1093
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,950
Oh, my God.

1094
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,190
Oh, my God.

1095
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,690
Bow.

1096
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,350
Be careful.

1097
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,370
You're going to die.

1098
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,390
You're driving the car.

1099
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,710
You're driving the car, doggie.

1100
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,230
Oh.

1101
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,950
I fucked it up.

1102
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,050
I fucked it up.

1103
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,650
I fucked it up.

1104
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,610
Please help me, bro.

1105
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,490
Oh, sorry.

1106
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,810
I thought I was on the bottom again.

1107
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:39,170
Okay.

1108
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,030
Guys.

1109
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,430
Guys.

1110
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:41,990
Guys.

1111
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:42,990
Guys.

1112
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,330
Guys.

1113
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,190
I think the person on the bottom just has to run.

1114
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,830
Yeah, just run on the bottom.

1115
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,670
Oh, that's me.

1116
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,530
Don't move.

1117
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,090
Only punch.

1118
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,670
Don't move.

1119
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,250
Only punch.

1120
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,970
Everyone else has to punch.

1121
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,790
We're at like an angle.

1122
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,730
Oh, my God.

1123
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,450
He can punch too.

1124
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,410
We have to kill him.

1125
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,370
We gotta get closer.

1126
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,570
Okay.

1127
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,670
That's a little bit too close.

1128
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,770
We were so close.

1129
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,130
Dude, do we gotta jump?

1130
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,210
No, we would just fall to our death.

1131
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:13,570
Okay.

1132
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,250
No, no, no.

1133
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,890
We just turn and punch at him.

1134
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,950
We just turn and punch at him.

1135
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,430
Okay.

1136
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,590
Nice, nice, nice.

1137
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,150
This is good.

1138
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,010
This is a good formation.

1139
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,050
Get us a little closer.

1140
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,510
What is the range of our pocket?

1141
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:23,970
That's scary.

1142
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,290
He's gonna hit us.

1143
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:25,990
He's gonna hit us.

1144
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,290
Oh.

1145
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,150
Are we getting hit by the block up top?

1146
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,570
I didn't see.

1147
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,350
No, no, no.

1148
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,130
He punches too.

1149
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:36,910
He punches too.

1150
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,390
But the only way we're close enough to him is if he's close enough to us.

1151
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,750
But the only way we're close enough to him is if he's close enough to us.

1152
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:47,250
The person on the bottom is gonna have to time it so they run forward when the punch happens and then run back when it's not happening.

1153
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,530
You don't go faster though.

1154
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,510
You can't run fast enough.

1155
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,330
Oh, shit.

1156
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,110
Well, okay.

1157
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,210
We tried.

1158
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,090
One punch.

1159
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,350
We all have to jump over him.

1160
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,450
Or into the hole.

1161
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,450
Yeah.

1162
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,450
Let's just only get close to his fist.

1163
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,010
We fell off.

1164
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,650
31 hits on him.

1165
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,630
That wasn't me.

1166
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,150
Okay.

1167
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,010
I'm just gonna die.

1168
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,230
Dude, we can fall.

1169
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,330
We can fall.

1170
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,770
I think we should get behind him.

1171
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,450
We can fall.

1172
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,750
So we can get behind him.

1173
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,190
Get behind him.

1174
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,750
I don't think so.

1175
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,710
I don't think so.

1176
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,930
That was a good idea.

1177
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,730
Can you punch his punch back?

1178
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,630
Can the person who's in line with his punch We have to get all 31 punches before he does.

1179
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,030
We have to get all 31 punches before he does.

1180
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,230
Oh, we were doing it.

1181
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,950
I think it's the people that are on the lower side.

1182
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,550
I think it's the people that are on the lower side.

1183
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,550
It's the people up front.

1184
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,610
Only the person at top has to punch.

1185
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,430
Only the people at top punch and the lower people.

1186
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,310
We make room for the fist.

1187
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,130
Does it go down?

1188
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,330
Does the 31 punch counter go down?

1189
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,170
Yeah.

1190
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,550
So it's just only one person.

1191
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,110
I bet you were gonna run out of room.

1192
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,910
Don't say that.

1193
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,690
Don't say that.

1194
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,830
We have so much room.

1195
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,410
Look at that.

1196
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,390
That's why I think everybody has to be perfectly lined up.

1197
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,210
Oh no.

1198
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,910
We're running out of room.

1199
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,430
Oh no.

1200
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,890
I think people in line with his punch should see if you can punch when his punch comes forward.

1201
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,750
So we have to like...

1202
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,610
You need to back up.

1203
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,990
We need to be like...

1204
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,570
Like perfectly straight.

1205
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,530
I thought I could take it.

1206
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,210
Can you guys be perfectly straight for me?

1207
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,950
Be perfectly straight for me, okay?

1208
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,370
I know it's gonna be really hard.

1209
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,630
That's never possible for me.

1210
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,410
Yeah, there you go.

1211
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,450
I think the ladder was the best option we had.

1212
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,350
Yeah.

1213
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,690
It's hard because if the person below you moves, you even get slightly put off.

1214
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,530
So we have to be perfect.

1215
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,390
We just gotta not fuck it up, I think.

1216
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,830
I think he's dragging...

1217
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,550
Yeah, I think the ladder...

1218
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,470
Like the bottom three cannot be close to him.

1219
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,310
Okay.

1220
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,750
Yeah.

1221
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,350
So stagger forward and then the...

1222
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,930
I think we have to move closer.

1223
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:25,990
Do we have to sink back and forth?

1224
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,230
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1225
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:32,210
The lower people have to move forward towards him when his fist is back.

1226
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,510
That seems kinda hard because if one person falls off, the ladder is just gone.

1227
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,650
It's completely gone.

1228
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,790
Just don't fall off.

1229
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,970
Just don't fall off, guys.

1230
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,790
There you go.

1232
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,410
See?

1233
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,330
No pressure.

1234
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,370
No pressure, guys.

1235
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,090
We got it.

1236
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,530
So the person second to the lowest has to just kinda move, which is me again, so I'll show you.

1237
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,850
Oh god, I'm bottom.

1238
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,650
It's alright.

1239
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,170
It's fine.

1240
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,390
People above me just don't move, so I have to go like this, dodge them, and then...

1241
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,170
We said to have a little bit of a ladder, though.

1242
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:08,230
I think the people up top are going to need to adjust so you're gonna have to move, unfortunately.

1243
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,510
I got it.

1244
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1245
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,670
We got this.

1246
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,550
I believe in you guys.

1247
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,130
Push!

1248
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,290
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1249
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,390
Okay, we don't got this.

1250
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,150
Hmm...

1251
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,850
What is this boss level shit?

1252
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,610
I got you guys.

1253
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,210
Alright, thank you.

1254
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,670
Don't be afraid.

1255
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,110
Oh my god!

1256
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,150
I got you guys!

1257
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,670
That was neat.

1258
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,950
He doesn't seem like it!

1259
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,330
Guys, I got you guys.

1260
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,330
Can we get behind him?

1261
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,610
Wait, let's see if we can time it.

1262
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,610
No, we can absolutely not get behind him.

1263
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,230
No, no, he's way too chonky.

1264
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,030
He's way too chonky.

1265
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,670
He's way too chonky.

1266
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:51,570
Okay.

1267
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,630
Oh hey again, kids.

1268
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,970
Alright, don't worry, I got the timing.

1269
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,010
Buckle the fuck up.

1270
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,330
Oh, what?

1271
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,850
What happened?

1272
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,230
What happened?

1273
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,030
Something just jumped out of my head.

1274
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,810
I was waiting for you to go.

1275
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,770
Don't worry, I got the timing.

1276
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,470
Don't worry, I got the timing for sure.

1277
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,150
Don't worry, I got the timing for sure.

1278
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,650
Oh!

1279
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,570
This is good, this is good.

1280
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,970
This is so messed up.

1281
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,770
This is so messed up.

1282
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:20,110
This is fucking hard.

1283
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,710
Okay, this time we got this.

1284
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,010
I believe in us.

1285
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,450
Oh!

1286
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,630
Oh!

1287
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,830
We kind of have the hang of it.

1288
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,750
Kind of, sort of.

1289
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,850
I don't know, guys.

1290
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,270
I don't know about this.

1291
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,010
If we were in the same positions, it would be okay.

1292
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,250
Yeah, I agree.

1293
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,810
I'm not gonna move.

1294
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,750
I'm not gonna move.

1295
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,810
I think people at the top don't have to move.

1296
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,230
It's only the people at the bottom that have to move.

1297
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:49,810
Okay.

1298
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,490
Are you serious, Maya?

1299
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,990
This is my first time.

1300
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:54,790
Have mercy.

1301
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:55,490
Okay.

1302
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,810
Yeah, I think when the ladder is going like...

1303
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,810
really close, it means that when we dodge, it's fucking aside.

1304
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,790
Okay, we're good, we're good.

1305
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,150
Oh, shoot.

1306
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're doing it, we're doing it.

1307
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,810
You're so smart, we literally almost had him.

1308
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,790
I hit him every single time.

1309
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,550
Guys, I didn't hit him.

1310
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,070
I was just...

1311
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,030
Did anybody even miss?

1312
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,570
I didn't hit him at all.

1313
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,470
You can't afford a single miss.

1314
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,210
Oh, sorry.

1315
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,130
I'm sorry.

1316
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,090
Oh, god.

1317
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,070
Are you guys okay?

1318
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,090
Yeah, we're okay.

1319
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,450
I'm just gonna keep running.

1320
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,810
We had it, we had it.

1321
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,830
We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.

1322
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,630
We're doing it for you.

1323
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,410
We don't move, people at the top don't move.

1324
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:45,670
We don't move.

1325
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,130
Just the people in the middle.

1326
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:48,790
Oh, sorry.

1327
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,650
Sorry.

1328
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,370
We got this though, we got this.

1329
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,850
For you.

1330
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,670
I don't like to be a bottom.

1331
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,350
This is the moment.

1332
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,590
Okay, okay, okay.

1333
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,670
Okay, punch.

1334
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,250
Nice.

1335
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,190
Punch.

1336
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,190
We were so close.

1337
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,770
We were too close to him, I think.

1338
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,290
People at the top stopped moving so close to him.

1339
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,570
It's fucking up how much room we have.

1340
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:16,930
Oh, no.

1341
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:17,970
This pressure.

1342
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,710
I think we can do it.

1343
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,010
Literally the person on the bottom is the only one.

1344
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,230
The second to the bottom.

1345
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,930
No, Pink, I think you had to move there too because I hit you, I think.

1346
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,930
The bottom three?

1347
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,470
It's the second and third.

1348
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,550
Oh, God.

1349
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,750
I think it's second and third.

1350
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,430
Yeah.

1351
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,010
I just scoot up.

1352
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,970
Am I too far away?

1353
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,030
Yeah.

1354
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,090
Oh!

1355
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,710
Yeah, yeah, too far.

1356
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,470
We got this.

1357
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,470
I believe in you.

1358
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,430
I believe in you.

1359
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,270
Okay, maybe not.

1360
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,070
Guys, maybe we should stop believing.

1361
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,870
Okay, okay.

1362
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,950
This is it.

1363
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,130
This is it.

1364
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,430
I believe.

1365
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,690
Okay, I walked as far as I could.

1366
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,010
Remember when he had three health, bro?

1367
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,070
Okay, okay.

1368
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,130
Where am I?

1369
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,210
Okay, here we go, top.

1370
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,330
Thank God.

1371
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,530
Okay, here we go.

1372
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,510
Oh, no, we shifted to too much.

1373
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,110
Oh, God.

1374
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,270
Why doesn't it change position?

1375
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,230
Keep us the same.

1376
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,090
I know.

1377
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:39,690
It's so rude.

1378
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,170
Oh, God.

1379
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:42,910
Oh, my God.

1380
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,090
When Jibber did boo, I was like...

1381
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,150
Oh, no.

1382
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,150
Okay, this time for sure.

1383
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,050
This time for sure.

1384
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,470
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1385
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,530
Wumpus, wumpus.

1386
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,130
That wasn't me, that wasn't me.

1387
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,350
That was me, that was me.

1388
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,590
Okay, yay.

1389
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,530
I don't have to move except for punch.

1390
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,770
Goodbye, dude.

1391
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,810
People at the top have it good.

1392
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:10,610
Oh, my God.

1393
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,950
Good start, good start.

1394
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,610
Good start, good start.

1395
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,170
Nice, just keep punching.

1396
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,050
Oh, looks close enough, I don't think.

1397
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:16,330
Yeah.

1398
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,050
Okay, okay.

1399
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:20,850
We're good, we're good.

1400
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:21,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1401
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,430
Yeah, baby.

1402
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,310
Easy.

1403
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,910
Oh, my God.

1404
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,510
We figured it out, we figured it out.

1405
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:31,810
It's just too easy.

1406
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,450
We're so good at video games, guys.

1407
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:34,970
Oh, my God.

1408
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:37,530
Hello.

1409
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,050
Me when the game is good.

1410
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,630
Me when the game is good.

1411
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,810
I think Val's having a stroke right now.

1412
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,250
We did 14.

1413
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:52,050
Yay.

1414
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,430
Yay.

1415
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,330
We made it.

1416
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,950
All right, back to time limit.

1417
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,330
That was awesome.

1418
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:00,690
Oh, my God.

1419
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,930
Now we got a time limit here.

1420
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,690
Oh, no, I don't want that.

1421
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,190
That's level five.

1422
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,750
Oh, it's coins, it's coins.

1423
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:09,910
Oh, no, the coins.

1424
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,910
Do it, dude, do it, dude.

1425
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:14,470
Beautiful coins.

1426
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,630
I'm gonna get over here, get over here.

1427
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,370
I'm gonna use your head.

1428
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:19,850
Two beautiful people.

1429
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,110
Guys, I don't think...

1430
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,370
I'm heading over here.

1431
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,170
Yes.

1432
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,570
Don't worry.

1433
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,170
I'm heading to the other side.

1434
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,710
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1435
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,090
On the other side.

1436
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,810
Go, go, go, go, go.

1437
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:38,930
Don't jump because then...

1438
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:42,050
The last person can just fall and get those.

1439
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:43,430
Where's the key?

1440
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:43,910
Where's the key?

1441
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,310
Get the key, get the key, get the key.

1442
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,810
Wait, guys, we're not...

1443
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,870
Guys, we're not gonna make it.

1444
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,330
Guys, we're not productive.

1445
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,290
You just gave up.

1446
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,130
Stop it.

1447
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,010
Guys, what is nihilism?

1448
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:09,850
It's like in a fucking zombie movie when someone just decides to execute everybody because they don't have anything anyway.

1449
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,670
I was like, it's over.

1450
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,390
We are just gonna fight it.

1451
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,410
Get these back.

1452
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,650
Guys, we have to get to the platform.

1453
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,610
Come here, come here.

1454
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,150
Okay.

1455
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,430
Oh, okay.

1456
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:22,190
Sorry.

1457
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,290
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it, guys.

1458
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:27,690
I don't...

1459
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,070
Stop it, please.

1460
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,290
Someone wait in the middle where the key is.

1461
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,710
I got it, I got it.

1462
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,330
I will not fall into existential despair.

1463
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,670
Okay, go, go, go, go.

1464
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,430
Move, move, move, move, move.

1465
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,030
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is that I was right.

1466
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,390
I was right.

1467
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,330
So what happened was...

1468
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:01,250
Okay, right side, right side, right side first.

1469
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,250
Oh, I'll come down.

1470
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,710
I'll come down, I'll come down, I'll come down.

1471
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,510
Okay, left side first, I guess.

1472
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,830
We can get this one, too.

1473
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,630
We can get this one, too.

1474
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:10,230
Goodbye.

1475
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,430
Get the top first.

1476
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:16,910
Oh, shit.

1477
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,250
Okay.

1478
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:17,610
Oh, nice.

1479
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,170
Guys.

1480
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,170
Are you guys okay over there?

1481
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,010
Yeah, we were getting the coins.

1482
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,430
There's coins we have to get.

1483
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,190
We all know slow and steady wins the race, right guys?

1484
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,030
Okay.

1485
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,030
Everybody get out of the way.

1486
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,570
Oh, no.

1487
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:37,690
Go, go, go, go.

1488
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,970
Get out of the way.

1489
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,350
Okay, go, go, go.

1490
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:47,930
It feels impossible.

1491
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,070
Okay.

1492
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,650
I'm grabbing the top part.

1493
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,130
Okay.

1494
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,150
Left, left, left.

1495
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,130
Here we go.

1496
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,650
Let's just preemptively wait.

1497
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,790
Somebody come down here with me.

1498
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,010
All right, right side, right side.

1499
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,790
Okay, guys.

1500
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,190
We need one more on the way.

1501
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:06,950
We need one more.

1502
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:07,650
Nice.

1503
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,510
This is the fastest we've ever got.

1504
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,470
Emily, why aren't you getting those coins above you?

1505
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,930
Somebody get the key.

1506
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:14,650
Somebody get the key.

1507
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:15,070
Get ready.

1508
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:15,970
All right.

1509
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,290
We're ready.

1510
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,610
We're ready.

1511
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,290
Get the key.

1512
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,970
Get the key.

1513
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,670
Get out of the way.

1514
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:20,370
Stay on top.

1515
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,250
All right.

1516
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,030
One at a time.

1517
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,790
One at a time.

1518
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:24,310
Nice.

1519
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:24,430
Nice.

1520
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,150
Go, go, go, go.

1521
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,620
Go, go, go, go.

1522
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,040
Yeah.

1523
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,280
Yeah.

1524
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,140
Look at that.

1525
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,280
So easy.

1526
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,140
So easy.

1527
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,000
They should have given us less time.

1528
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,860
That was way too much.

1529
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,480
I don't know about all that.

1530
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,920
Push, push, push.

1531
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,500
Push, push, push.

1532
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,540
Push.

1533
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,100
What's going to happen?

1534
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,900
Something going to fall from the sky?

1535
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,160
I think we're just going to die.

1536
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,700
I think we got to jump.

1537
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:56,820
Wait.

1538
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,460
Oh, we have to push to the other side.

1539
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,600
There's no key.

1540
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,300
What do you mean?

1541
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,800
We have to go to the other side.

1542
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,860
We have to go to the other side and push.

1543
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,740
I think it might not have a key.

1544
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,080
No, no.

1545
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,040
I think it's on this side.

1546
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,560
I don't think so.

1547
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,040
Please believe in me.

1548
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,340
I think you just have to push the box away from the door.

1549
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,060
There should be a key.

1550
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,100
There's always a key.

1551
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,620
But there's always a key.

1552
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,080
What if it's behind the block?

1553
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,380
I don't know.

1554
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,040
We didn't even try though.

1555
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,320
We didn't even try before we got sabotaged.

1556
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,540
That's true.

1557
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,540
Let's just see.

1558
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,320
I told you.

1559
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,140
I told you.

1560
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,560
Nobody believed in me.

1561
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,300
Okay, okay.

1562
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,780
Get in there.

1563
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,520
Push it.

1564
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,940
Nobody believed in me.

1565
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,220
We have to keep pushing.

1566
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,300
We have to push the blocks.

1567
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,340
Push the blocks and hit the buttons.

1568
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,780
And then we have to go up top.

1569
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,120
Excuse me.

1570
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,360
Come here.

1571
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,360
Call me a liar.

1572
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,960
I think we need that box.

1573
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,760
Oh, there's the key.

1574
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,540
Oh, nice.

1575
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,200
Let's go.

1576
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,140
Run.

1577
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,880
I don't think we can do it, bro.

1578
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,520
I don't think so.

1579
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,660
We totally got this.

1580
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,440
We got this.

1581
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,780
I will always believe in us.

1582
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,360
Push in.

1583
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:20,780
Push in.

1584
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,240
Push in.

1585
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,040
Push in.

1586
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:22,980
Push in.

1587
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:23,080
Push in.

1588
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:23,280
Push in.

1589
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,240
Push in.

1590
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,160
Push in.

1591
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,380
Jump on my head.

1592
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,720
I can't make it.

1593
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,720
We need that box.

1594
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,460
We need that box from the other side.

1595
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,660
There was that one box on the far left.

1596
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,620
Yeah, yeah.

1597
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,740
Alright, let's go.

1598
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,080
Let's go, guys.

1599
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,220
See that box?

1600
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,020
It's right on top.

1601
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,660
We gotta get that one box.

1602
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,700
The little one?

1603
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,600
We do not need as many people down there.

1604
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,020
I was here first, guys.

1605
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,880
I was here first.

1606
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,680
I was here first.

1607
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,880
You want one more?

1608
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,480
Just one here?

1609
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,740
My head is for you.

1610
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,740
Alright, we need one more here.

1611
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,140
And then we need...

1612
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,600
We need four.

1613
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,840
Okay, we need to push that box down.

1614
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,340
Yeah, push that box.

1615
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,940
And then we'll just push the other one.

1616
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,100
And then I'll push this.

1617
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:10,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1618
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,840
Get the key.

1619
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,700
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1620
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,040
And then one of us push that.

1621
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,060
Oh, god.

1622
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,760
Okay.

1623
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,680
And then we just keep pushing.

1624
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,060
Don't worry, I will keep pushing you so it looks like...

1625
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:26,800
You can push two boxes at the same time.

1626
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,260
Don't worry, it looks like we're going faster.

1627
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,960
Oh, wait.

1628
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,060
Oh, there we go, there we go.

1629
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,300
I don't know if we're gonna make it, but we got this track down.

1630
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,960
I think we can make it.

1631
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,140
I think we can make it.

1632
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,620
Alright, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

1633
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,020
Oh, yeah, no, we can't make it.

1634
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,700
We need the key.

1635
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,520
We need the key.

1636
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,100
We need the key.

1637
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,280
Three on the second bottom.

1638
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,580
Two on the second bottom.

1639
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,320
Guys, we figured it out, we figured it out.

1640
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,120
I'm gonna jump on you, Belle.

1641
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,220
Go, Belle.

1642
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,600
Alright, here we go.

1643
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,800
Go, go, go.

1644
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,780
We need more people upstairs.

1645
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,800
Go, go, go, go.

1646
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,840
Use my head, use my head.

1647
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,180
Somebody use my head.

1648
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,090
All bottoms.

1649
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,190
And push that box down.

1650
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,190
Push the box.

1651
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,590
Put it on my head and then I can carry it.

1652
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,390
True, true, true.

1653
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,670
Guys, guys, I can't get the key.

1654
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,410
Guys, guys, go.

1655
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,730
Go, go, go, go.

1656
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,650
Go, go, go, go.

1657
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,930
Okay, that box has to be...

1658
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,370
Go, go, go, go.

1659
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:33,870
Push.

1660
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:34,770
Push.

1661
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,170
Oh, my God.

1662
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,970
She got like a fucking heart attack right there.

1663
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,880
There we go.

1664
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,620
Go, go, go, go.

1665
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,080
I didn't realize this was a social deduction game.

1666
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:03,560
I didn't realize this was a social deduction game.

1667
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,660
Look at us over here.

1668
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,300
Okay, we got this.

1669
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,480
I believe in us.

1670
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,160
Jump, jump, jump.

1671
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,680
Our chungus lives, bro.

1672
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,060
We're too thick.

1673
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Because we're not all the main character.

1674
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,400
One of us has to be the side character, guys.

1675
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,280
One of us has to be the side character.

1676
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,380
One of us has to be the side character.

1677
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,340
Run, run with the block, Annie.

1678
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,840
Okay, nice.

1679
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,900
Now put it on their head and run with it.

1680
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,100
Okay, go, go, just run.

1681
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:31,940
Just run.

1682
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,400
Push the block without you.

1683
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,280
Push, push, push.

1684
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,760
Eve, ho.

1685
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,640
Eve, ho.

1686
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,800
Eve, ho.

1687
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,580
Eve, ho.

1688
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,580
Go, go, go, go.

1689
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,140
Everyone back up, back up, back up.

1690
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,400
Everyone back up.

1691
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,340
Go, go, go, go.

1692
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,640
Get this off of me.

1693
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,440
Get this off of me.

1694
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,880
Get this off of me.

1695
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:14,370
Let's

1696
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,900
figure this out.

1697
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,460
Guys, stop sucking.

1698
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,280
We got more.

1699
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,060
We got more.

1700
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,760
Okay, I need someone to suck me here.

1701
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,360
Get on my head.

1702
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,260
Guys, someone suck me off.

1703
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,620
I'm sucking.

1704
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,460
Get on my head.

1705
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,940
Guys, that doesn't help.

1706
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,320
I wish we could, but we're stuck down here.

1707
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:57,180
Please, I need somebody to suck me off.

1708
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,100
There we go, okay.

1709
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Guys, we're supposed to go to the other side.

1710
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,860
Wait, how do you push?

1711
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,420
Thank you.

1712
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,480
Oh, wait.

1713
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:03,940
Like that?

1714
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,500
Alright, it's great that Lime and Amelie are doing everything for us while we stay here.

1715
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,100
Yeah, go get them, Tiger.

1716
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,780
We're sort of confused.

1717
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,660
You suck the front, I suck the back.

1718
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,500
I died.

1719
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,320
I'm doing what I love, okay?

1720
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,320
Left and right.

1721
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,320
Left and right.

1722
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,240
Left.

1723
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,540
I'm at the left side.

1724
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,600
Left side.

1725
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:39,780
Left side.

1726
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,200
Left side.

1727
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,300
I'm trying to go home.

1728
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,740
I'm at soup.

1729
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,400
I'm at soup.

1730
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,180
Okay.

1731
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:43,920
Wait.

1732
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,140
Hop on my head.

1733
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:45,580
Okay.

1734
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,900
Guys, that works.

1735
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,240
That works.

1736
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,560
That works.

1737
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,160
Okay.

1738
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:48,680
We got it.

1739
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,460
Nice.

1740
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:50,620
Up.

1741
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,340
Up.

1742
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:51,400
Up.

1743
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:51,920
Up.

1744
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,280
Up.

1745
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:53,860
Suck here.

1746
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,160
Suck here.

1747
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,980
And then push me forward.

1748
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,240
Jump.

1749
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,600
Push me forward.

1750
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,380
Amelie.

1751
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:57,720
Amelie.

1752
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,260
There we go.

1753
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:58,860
Yay.

1754
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,220
Can I ask for a little suck?

1755
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,600
Just a little.

1756
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,000
Oh, whatever.

1757
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

1758
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,360
Don't worry.

1759
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,040
I got you guys.

1760
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,440

00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,600
Alright, there you go.

1765
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,100
Yeah, thank you.

1766
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:12,880
I'm sorry.

1767
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:13,800
Yay.

1768
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,620
Alright, nice.

1769
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:15,740
Nice.

1770
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,160
Okay, we're almost there.

1771
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:17,680
We're almost there.

1772
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,180
Get the key.

1773
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,600

Get the key.

1775
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,640
I can start sucking.

1776
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,220
I need help.

1777
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,240
I need help, man.

1778
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:22,560
Stop.

1779
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:22,940
Stop.

1780
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,020
We need to suck Snuffy.

1781
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,100
We need to suck Snuffy.

1782
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,120

00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:55,910
Oh.

00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:56,470
Not again.

1785
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:57,190
Wait.

1786
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:57,930
Oh, what?

1787
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:58,590
They disappear.

1788
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,030
Oh, they're all gone.

1789
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,970
Oh, you can put them all inside.

1790
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:04,330
Oh, I can absorb Doki balls.

1791
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:05,450
Oh, my gosh.

1792
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:06,090
We've been simplified.

1793
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,650
We're like magical.

1794
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,930
We're dolling this.

1795
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:09,330

1803
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:18,950
And then somebody put me in.

00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:19,190
There we go.

1807
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:21,850

Okay.

00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,690
I got stuck not where I am right now.

1818
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,270
We can uncompress over here.

1819
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:32,730
Alright.

1820
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,510

Alright.

00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,110
Oh, sorry, guys.

1825
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:39,630
Try it.

1826
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,490
You have to hold it in one.

1827
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,770
Oh, no, you don't die.

1828
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:44,090
Okay.

1829
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:44,970

Don't dart me, Bao.

00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:53,810
No!

1837
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:55,650
No, it's okay.

1838
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:56,110
We don't die.

1839
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,550
We just have a time limit of, like, not a lot of time.

1840
00:57:59,530 --> 00:57:59,890
Don't worry.

1841
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:00,430
I got you.

1842
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:02,590
I'm being carried.

1843
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,390
I love this.

1844
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,550
Carry me, Bao.

1845
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:05,730
Uh-oh.

1846
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:06,610
Okay, I think...

1847
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,450
I got this.

1848
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,490
Oh, hey, guys.

1849
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:12,430
Oh, no.

1850
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,530
The perpetual...

1851
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:13,930
Oh, no.

1852
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:14,710

1853
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:15,630
Oh.

00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,550
My whole motion machine.

1855
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,650
Okay, I think we put us all into one.

1856
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:23,870
Someone gather us all.

1857
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,290
Yeah, I got...

1858
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:25,970
Oh, my God.

1859
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,970
We got all of us up into one ball.

1860
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,350
And then... We're not enough time.

1861
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,250
And then I just... We got practice now!

1862
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,130
Okay.

1863
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,830
Good practice, team.

1864
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,010
Good practice, guys.

1865
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:39,170
Don't worry.

1866
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,830
We practiced our aim.

1867
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:41,690
I got you.

1868
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:41,710
I got you.

1869
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,990
Don't worry.

1870
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:43,530
I got this.

1871
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:45,530
Okay.

1872
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:47,030
Okay.

1873
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:48,530
Perpetual fall.

1874
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,510
We were so close.

1875
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:52,690
So low.

1876
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:53,590
Oh, boy.

1877
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,670
Okay.

1878
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,390
I have compressed all my friends.

1879
00:58:59,010 --> 00:58:59,410
Okay.

1880
00:58:59,510 --> 00:58:59,910
Stay there.

1881
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,110
That was the sound of me being compressed, by the way.

1882
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:03,530
Okay.

1883
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:04,770
I'm compressing over here.

1884
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,290
Somebody compress me.

1885
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:08,990
Nice.

1886
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:09,550
All right.

1887
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,130
All right.

1888
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,330
I wish to be compressed.

1889
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,190
Somebody put me in their mouth right now.

1890
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,050
Somebody put me in their mouth right now.

1891
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:18,050
Yeah.

1892
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:19,530
Someone put me in their Pokeball.

1893
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:20,650
Okay.

1894
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,470
Now, poop them out over there.

1895
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:23,650
Okay.

1896
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:24,770
Now, poop them out over there.

1897
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,330
Nice aim.

1898
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:27,850
Everybody was moving.

1899
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,250
People were moving.

1900
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:29,710
I couldn't focus.

1901
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:32,510
Can we get our FPS players up in here, please?

1902
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,710
Can we get our FPS players up in here, please?

1903
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,890
FPS players have one fucking job.

1904
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:38,150
Look.

1905
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,930
I have like 90 ping, guys.

1906
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:41,390
I have 90 ping.

1907
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,670
Okay.

1908
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:43,910
Okay.

1909
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:44,330
Ping div.

1910
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:44,650
Ping div.

1911
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:45,610
Wait.

1912
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,130
What the fuck?

1913
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,250
I was so close.

1914
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:47,550
Wait.

1915
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,070
What happened to me?

1916
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,390
Get on my head now.

1917
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:51,070
Get on my head.

1918
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:52,270
Fuck.

1919
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:52,470
I'm out.

1920
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:53,210
Okay.

1921
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:53,570
Nice.

1922
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,430
Oh, sorry.

1923
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,050
Sorry.

1924
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:55,950
I'm so sorry.

1925
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,930
If you guys get all into one, it'll be just one.

1926
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:00,450
Yeah.

1927
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:00,750
Yeah.

1928
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:01,010
Yeah.

1929
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,150
Okay.

1930
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,690
Let's put all of each other into one right now.

1931
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,510
All of us into one.

1932
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:07,850
I can't.

1933
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,610
I have red on me.

1934
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,790
So, Min has to suck.

1935
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:11,530
Orange?

1936
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,530
Orange and white?

1937
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,810
It's really, really cozy because I haven't played in a while.

1938
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:17,190
Because I've just been carried around like Doki.

1939
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:17,390
Alright.

1940
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:17,690
That's fine.

1941
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:18,430
Three people.

1942
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:18,930
That's fine.

1943
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:19,770
Three people.

1944
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:20,290
Three people.

1945
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,790
We got this.

1946
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,310
That's three chances.

1947
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,270
Good job, everybody.

1948
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,070
Good job, guys.

1949
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,210
I'll catch you this time.

1950
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:27,570
Hold on.

1951
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:28,750
Yeah.

1952
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:29,030
Yeah.

1953
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:29,310
Alright.

1954
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,870
Oh, I spat my guy out.

1955
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:32,590
Aw, man.

1956
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:37,370
I got...

1957
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,090
I got caught.

1958
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:39,910
Hey, what's up?

1959
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,470
That's actually so hard.

1960
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:45,250
I know.

1961
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,790
Wait.

1962
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:49,790
Who has the lowest ping?

1963
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,530
I have 27 ping.

1964
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,070
But I'm not reliable alone.

1965
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:54,650
That's crazy.

1966
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,270
I'm not reliable, please.

1967
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:01,350
I should've never said anything.

1968
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:02,590
Put that on my head.

1969
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:03,350
Alright.

1970
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:03,610
Nice.

1971
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,730
I don't think we got...

1972
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:06,970
Oh, sorry.

1973
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:06,970
Close.

1974
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:07,250
Close.

1975
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,290
Close.

1976
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:07,590
Close, close.

1977
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:10,270
I believe in you.

1978
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:13,710
We just need one person on the other side.

1979
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:14,430
Sorry.

1980
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,150
Sorry.

1981
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:17,850
Sorry.

1982
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:18,250
Sorry.

1983
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:20,370
Very good.

1984
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:20,850
Very good.

1985
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:21,650
Nice.

1986
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:22,070
Okay.

1987
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,450
Now we suck each other.

1988
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:23,810
Here.

1989
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:24,770
Okay.

1990
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,710
I got someone here.

1991
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:26,810
Okay.

1992
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:27,030
Here.

1993
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:27,970
Somebody get me.

1994
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:29,690
OK.

1995
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:30,890
I'll keep them in my mouth.

1996
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,470
Huge.

1997
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:32,110
Huge.

1998
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,450
Do your best.

1999
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:42,190
Do your best.

2000
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,130
You got one shot.

2001
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,630
I overestimated a little bit.

2002
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,450
I think you can fire it right as you jump off.

2003
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:51,750
It feels like that.

2004
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,130
Yeah, maybe.

2005
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,990
It's okay, we got 40 whole seconds.

2006
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:56,590
It's easy.

2007
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,270
So close.

2008
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,090
I got you.

2009
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:01,510
So close.

2010
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,450
Oh, we got it!

2011
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:05,550
I did it!

2012
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,630
Oh my god!

2013
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,390
Just keep hitting.

2014
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:15,670
Just keep hitting.

2015
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:17,630
Nice,

2016
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:22,610
nice, nice, nice.

2017
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:23,410
Spit, spit, spit.

2018
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:26,050
Spit, spit, spit, spit.

2019
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,490
Oh my god.

2020
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,010
Oh my god.

2021
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:33,130
Come on.

2022
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:33,930
Come on.

2023
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:34,870
Come on.

2024
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,450
Guys, you just hit to me one person.

2025
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,510
Why did you all spit each other out?

2026
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,850
Why did you all spit each other out?

2027
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,470
I don't know.

2028
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:46,090
I don't know.

2029
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,570
You just hit to me one person.

2030
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,590
Wait, no.

2031
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:57,310
Sometimes when you miss, the person gets like reformed.

2032
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:57,910
That out, yeah.

2033
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:58,710
Yeah.

2034
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,410
Okay, here we go.

2035
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,170
Alright, consume me, okay.

2036
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:03,930
I pretty much haven't played this level.

2037
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:04,590
Oh, it's Duffy.

2038
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:05,390
Duffy, consume me.

2039
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:07,390
Take me with you.

2040
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:07,950
Okay, there you go.

2041
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:08,590
Take me with you.

2042
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,870
Well, you guys can take... yeah, yeah, yeah.

2043
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,030
Oh wait, it's Amelie.

2044
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:12,910
Oh, I mean...

2045
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,850
What is that?

2046
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,990
What is that supposed to mean?

2047
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,310
Amelie over here.

2048
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,470
No, it's Amelie.

2049
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,290
Who said that?

2050
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,630
Who said that?

2051
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:25,870
What is that?

2052
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:30,610
I mean, there aren't any saw blades or spikes, so it's probably fine.

2053
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:30,990
Sorry.

2054
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:33,230
What?

2055
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,250
I totally made that one.

2056
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,130
Okay.

2057
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,510
Guys, you guys don't need to spit out...

2058
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,050
Guys, don't need to spit people out, guys.

2059
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:42,910
Yeah.

2060
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:45,890
Consume me.

2061
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:47,270
Consume.

2062
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,210
You guys suck somebody.

2063
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:50,630
Okay, there you go.

2064
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,470
All right, you guys have got this.

2065
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,130
Okay.

2066
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,850
You've got this.

2067
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,430
Bow, Bow, we need you to bow.

2068
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:02,210
We cannot be in perpetual motion right now.

2069
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:03,430
No!

2070
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,450
I got you, Doki.

2071
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,350
I got you, Doki.

2072
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,230
Ah!

2073
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,250
Okay, I totally got this.

2074
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,310
I got you, Doki.

2075
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,150
Yay!

2076
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,090
Nice, nice, nice!

2077
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,530
All right, spit Doki out.

2078
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:14,990
Nice.

2079
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,190
Okay, I got three people.

2080
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:19,730
It's just me.

2081
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,510
It's just me.

2082
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,690
No pressure.

2083
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:28,750
Oh, no.

2084
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,430
It's actually so bad.

2085
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,110
Okay.

2086
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,570
It's so bad.

2087
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:36,910
Please.

2088
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,150
Okay,

2089
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,510
Amelie's...

2090
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:46,030
Okay.

2091
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,370
No pressure.

2092
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,370
No pressure, guys.

2093
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,330
Okay.

2094
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,410
Amelie went to the bathroom on a time.

2095
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:55,750
Oh, yeah.

2096
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,470
I think we're just...

2097
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,990
Can you suck her up?

2098
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,930
Just suck her up.

2099
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,890
Why did none of us suck her up?

2100
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,930
She was literally AFK.

2101
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,670
I can't push anybody back.

2102
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:08,410
Fire me back over.

2103
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,190
I can't.

2104
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,030
I can't.

2105
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:12,050
Holy carrier.

2106
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:12,690
What the heck?

2107
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:13,870
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2108
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:16,250
Why did none of us suck up the AFK person?

2109
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:17,650
We can't.

2110
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,150
None of us can spit her out.

2111
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:19,970
None of us can.

2112
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,270
Oh, that's awkward.

2113
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:22,450
That's awkward.

2114
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,650
Yeah, she's gonna go to the bathroom.

2115
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:26,850
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

2116
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:28,890
Restart level.

2117
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,310
Okay, potty break.

2118
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:31,490
Potty break.

2119
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,350
Does anyone actually have to go?

2120
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:38,890
Meow.

2121
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:40,230
Meow.

2122
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,170
Meow.

2123
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:45,550
I'm actually kind of losing it.

2124
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:47,090
The music I'm gonna hear is my fucking nightmares.

2125
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:49,890
I fucking turned it off immediately, bro.

2126
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:52,970
Is there a way?

2127
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:53,310
Hold on.

2128
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,670
There's no way to turn just the music off.

2129
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:56,110
Okay.

2130
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,190
No, there is.

2131
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,590
It's just you probably had to have done it from the menu.

2132
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,830
Oh, in the main menu?

2133
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:01,330
Gotcha.

2134
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,350
Well, I guess I'll just fucking suffer then.

2135
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:03,750
That's fine.

2136
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:04,590
Yep.

2137
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,370
You suffer now.

2138
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:09,570
Yep.

2139
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:19,780
Yay!

2140
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,300
My Amazon order.

2141
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:21,820
BRB.

2142
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:23,940
Yippee!

2143
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,140
Mmm.

2144
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,330
Okay, okay, I'm back.

2145
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:31,590
I'm back.

2146
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,430
We now know that it takes you exactly the length of the 5-4 level to piss.

2147
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:37,410
Welcome back.

2148
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,750
Thank you, thank you.

2149
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,150
Doki also went to pee.

2150
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,090
Yeah, Doki, we can suck her up.

2151
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,150
It takes Doki to pee.

2152
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,670
It won't let me shoot her.

2153
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:49,350
Hold on.

2154
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:50,230
I'll shoot her there.

2155
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:50,850
There we go.

2156
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:51,430
There we go.

2157
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,090
Okay, let's go.

2158
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,030
Wait, this totally works out.

2159
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,830
Oh, sorry, Bao.

2160
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,050
Wait, I need to suck...

2161
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:58,790
Yeah, wait.

2162
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,010
Juniper needs to suck someone.

2163
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:03,030
Juniper?

2164
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:06,410
Oh, okay, hold on.

2165
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:07,890
But I need to keep Doki.

2166
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:08,550
Wait.

2167
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,390
Can someone suck me?

2168
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,730
I'm sucking, I'm sucking, I'm sucking.

2169
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:16,970
There we go.

2170
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,050
And I'll grab Doki.

2171
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,210
Little passenger princess.

2172
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:21,290
Okay.

2173
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:24,670
I cannot suck.

2174
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:25,990
It's like too close.

2175
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,390
Oh, we need someone who's active to go in there.

2176
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:32,790
I've been consumed.

2177
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,470
Oh, nice.

2178
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:34,910
Sorry.

2179
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:36,890
Oh, thank you.

2180
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:37,330
Big difference.

2181
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:38,170
Big difference.

2182
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,010
You can grab me.

2183
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:43,570
It's hard, dude.

2184
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:44,690
Oh, what?

2185
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:45,550
What the?

2186
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:46,930
How did that even happen?

2187
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:47,990
Thank you.

2188
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,970
There's such a fucking delay on it.

2189
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,590
I don't want to be in this mortal plane.

2190
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,270
This is the fastest, I guess.

2191
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:56,450
Yay!

2192
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:57,370
I did it!

2193
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:59,630
I've never seen one.

2194
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:00,610
Yay!

2195
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:04,250
I got you.

2196
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,330
Did you just block me?

2197
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:06,510
I don't know.

2198
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,650
Guys, we're missing like one person still.

2199
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,110
Oh, there you go.

2200
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,070
We got, we got, we got, we got.

2201
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,550
This is a practice round.

2202
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:13,910
Trust.

2203
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,350
Oh, we did it!

2204
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:18,070
I was trying!

2205
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,370
I was serious!

2206
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:26,250
We got it on the first try.

2207
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:31,150
Okay.

2208
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:31,870
That's fine.

2209
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,210
Alright, you consume me.

2210
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:34,590
I consume you.

2211
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:35,730
Somebody consume me.

2212
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,410
No, I can let you through.

2213
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:39,530
Right?

2214
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:40,750
There you go.

2215
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,150
Alright.

2216
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,030
Okay, who else is AFK?

2217
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,790
Don't shoot me through!

2218
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:48,670
Don't shoot me back!

2219
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,410
Why did you do that?

2220
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,310
We're doing it backwards.

2221
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,430
Oh, where am I?

2222
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,730
Let me in!

2223
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,330
Okay, somebody shoot me in.

2224
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:02,450
Somebody consume me.

2225
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,450
Okay, alright, there you go.

2226
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:05,450
Nice!

2227
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,390
Alright.

2228
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:09,330
Okay.

2229
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:12,790
That felt kind of personal.

2230
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,530
It was not.

2231
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:15,050
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2232
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,990
Alright, consume each other.

2233
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,850
We just needed as few people as possible.

2234
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:19,450
Okay, there you go.

2235
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:19,810
Yeah, there you go.

2236
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:20,530
Nice, nice, nice.

2237
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,950
Both got this.

2238
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,250
Alright, consume each other.

2239
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:26,630
Consume, consume.

2240
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,210
Oh, so close.

2241
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:32,270
I think actually the most people spitting people out here is probably the odds are in our favor.

2242
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,050
I think actually the most people spitting people out here is probably the odds are in our favor.

2243
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,970
No, there'll be too many people.

2244
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:35,990
Oh my god!

2245
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:37,950
Oh my god!

2246
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:39,370
Oh my god!

2247
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:43,130
I don't know who that was.

2248
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,310
Who the fuck took me back in there?

2249
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,010
I know who that was.

2250
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,570
I know who that was.

2251
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,790
There we go, okay.

2252
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,550
Who took me back in?

2253
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:52,390
No idea.

2254
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,450
Why is nobody jumping?

2255
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:56,410
I'm gonna try.

2256
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:58,730
You too, Dokie!

2257
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,310
Get in there!

2258
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:00,190
Oh, am I out?

2259
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:00,670
I'm out.

2260
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,130
Hold on.

2261
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,010
Am I out?

2262
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,370
Oh, I'm free!

2263
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:05,090
Freedom!

2264
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,950
Oh, okay.

2265
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:11,490
I have no idea where I am anymore.

2266
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:12,430
I'm in somebody's room.

2267
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:14,250
I'm in somebody's room.

2268
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,650
I hate this level.

2269
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,330
I kinda like it.

2270
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:25,110
I feel like while you guys are all stressing out, I'm being held like a baby.

2271
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,450
I know!

2272
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,750
It's pretty chill if you're not actually playing.

2273
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,130
You get to be in the little hole.

2274
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:32,950
Yes.

2275
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,970
I feel like somebody on the other side just take us over.

2276
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,050
It's just easier.

2277
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,890
I'm holding several people.

2278
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:42,970
Now I'm being held.

2279
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:45,190
You don't have to spit people out yet.

2280
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,470
I know.

2281
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:48,130
And I'll start grabbing people.

2282
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:52,130
Yeah, just grab people instead so we don't have to spit people out.

2283
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:53,030
Yeah, yeah.

2284
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:56,930
Yeah, I think the other side doesn't have to spit people out.

2285
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,890
The right side just grabs people over.

2286
01:10:59,070 --> 01:10:59,170
Yeah.

2287
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:00,710
There we go.

2288
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:01,630
See, it's that easy.

2289
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,770
Okay, don't spit anybody out, guys, until we're at the other side.

2290
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:06,910
Nobody has me!

2291
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:07,510
Okay.

2292
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:08,910
Okay.

2293
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,610
There was an attempt.

2294
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,050
Okay.

2295
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:17,770
Yeah, one at a time.

2296
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:18,810
Okay, go.

2297
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:20,410
Okay, you guys are too close.

2298
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:20,990
You can't suck.

2299
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:21,430
I don't have anybody.

2300
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:22,530
I don't have anybody to suck.

2301
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:23,450
Okay, there we go.

2302
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:24,610
Okay.

2303
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:26,970
Put me back in.

2304
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:30,750
Just be put in.

2305
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,890
Let me put people in.

2306
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,790
Let me do it.

2307
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:37,830
Okay, nice, nice, but just keep putting people in your mouth.

2308
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:38,890
Okay, I'm trying.

2309
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,750
Just cram us in your mouth.

2310
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,050
You got this.

2311
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,650
Unlock the door.

2312
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:45,950
Yeah, unlock the door.

2313
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:47,050
Take your time.

2314
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,250
It's me!

2315
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:54,970
Fuck

2316
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,760
that level.

2317
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:02,680
Yeah!

2318
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,060
Oh my god.

2319
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:08,400
Yay.

2320
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,240
We're free.

2321
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,280
No overtime limit.

2322
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,060
Shoot them up, baby.

2323
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:16,540
Oh.

2324
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,880
This is memory right here.

2325
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,140
Oh no.

2326
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,640
We can shoot each other.

2327
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,760
We can shoot each other.

2328
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,420
We can kill each other.

2329
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,500
Blast my booty.

2330
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,440
We're so fucked.

2331
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,640
This is my area.

2332
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,080
This is mine.

2333
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,360
I'm at the very bottom.

2334
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,440
Okay, make a path for us.

2335
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,220
Make a path.

2336
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,480
You have to shoot your own color.

2337
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,620
You have to shoot your own color.

2338
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:46,980
Shoot your own color.

2339
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,440
Learn colors.

2340
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,640
Red, where's red?

2341
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,400
Where's red?

2342
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,080
Where's red?

2343
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,820
I've done my part.

2344
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,060
We need more than just two.

2345
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,760
I was like, I've done my part and it's just two.

2346
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,840
My job here is done.

2347
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,660
Orange, orange, orange.

2348
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,860
Make a long path.

2349
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,960
Make a long path for us.

2350
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:16,840
Get out of my way.

2351
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,180
You're in front of me.

2352
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,520
I did all of my colors.

2353
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,500
I'm proud of you.

2354
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,220
Me too.

2355
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,960
Orange, orange, orange.

2356
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,760
Orange, orange, orange.

2357
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,820
Orange, orange, orange.

2358
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:35,300
You guys were too cramped in.

2359
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:35,760
I was too far behind.

2360
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,400
I thought you did all your colors.

2361
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,660
I did.

2362
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,360
I'm gonna kill you right now.

2363
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,220
I'm gonna kill you.

2364
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,140
I swear to God.

2365
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,720
You're just şehp Employee 3!

2366
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:53,180
I knew you'd try a little harder.

2367
01:13:53,580 --> 01:14:02,500
I knew he'd mess up.็ coe solid I heard you shoot me in the back of the head and then drive full speed in.

2368
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,020
Maybe.

2369
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:05,740
Maybe?

2370
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,420
I got more colors.

2371
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,060
I got all blue!

2372
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,220
Me, too.

2373
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,960
we should do this right now look at that there's no more yellow

2374
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:34,240
we line up in our colors and then just shoot in a line we won't shoot each other that's true yeah but then i think it's randomized It's randomized, isn't it?

2375
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:34,940
I didn't know that.

2376
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,680
It's randomized.

2377
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,020
It's randomized.

2378
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:37,920
But as we see the color, we should...

2379
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,520
We should...

2380
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,480
As we see the color, we should line up possibly.

2381
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,360
Oh, my God.

2382
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,820
It's like kindergarten all over again.

2383
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,560
All right.

2384
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,400
Line up, guys.

2385
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,260
Line up.

2386
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,020
In a single file.

2387
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:47,740
We need like a designated...

2388
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,060
Green, yellow, blue, pink.

2389
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:51,300
I need more.

2390
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:51,940
I need more space.

2391
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:53,600
Okay.

2392
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,040
Okay.

2393
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:54,520
That's a lot of space.

2394
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:54,840
I got mine.

2395
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,280
I got mine.

2396
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:55,680
I got mine.

2397
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,660
It's not large enough.

2398
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,260
It's not large enough.

2399
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,060
I got my colors.

2400
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,300
I'm at the very back.

2401
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,440
Green, green, green.

2402
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:02,880
I'm at the green.

2403
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,020
The green, green, green.

2404
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:04,480
The green.

2405
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:04,800
Well...

2406
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,180
Okay.

2407
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,060
Yellow, yellow, yellow.

2408
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:08,340
Green.

2409
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:08,900
Green, green.

2410
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,240
In the space.

2411
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,180
Green, green, green.

2412
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:14,920
Giants.

2413
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,500
My ears.

2414
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,400
My ears were stuck.

2415
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:24,400
It was playing that little...

2416
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,980
What do you mean?

2417
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,020
Your ears were stuck.

2418
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,360
I stood still.

2419
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,260
I stood still.

2420
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,500
Okay, it's over.

2421
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:09,780
It's over.

2422
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,020
It's just over.

2423
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,760
It was a pixel.

2424
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,540
We're okay everybody with the power of friendship.

2425
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,440
We can do this.

2426
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,440
Green and blue and then purple.

2427
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,200
Up top because that's where the key is.

2428
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:28,780
True, yeah.

2429
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,400
Oh, sorry.

2430
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,560
I was just pressing up and I was not pressing space.

2431
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,900
Why do they get smaller?

2432
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,480
Oh, it's so small.

2433
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:42,280
Okay, blue.

2434
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:42,640
Okay.

2435
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,860
Purple, purple, purple.

2436
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2437
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,160
Okay, single file, do not stop.

2438
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:51,560
Don't stop.

2439
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,160
Okay.

2440
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,160
Alright, we're okay.

2441
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:54,680
Where's the door?

2442
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,240
Oh, there we go.

2443
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,460
Where is the door?

2444
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,420
What are you doing?

2445
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,860
I'm like having you encircled four times.

2446
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,260
Wait, I have to go in the bathroom.

2447
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,700
Everyone call us.

2448
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,520
I need one second.

2449
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,320
Be right back.

2450
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,540
Wait, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

2451
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,540
Alright, alright.

2452
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,060
It's time out, time out.

2453
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:15,760
Oh my god.

2454
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:16,920
Hey guys.

2455
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,460
This is a great game about friendship, isn't it?

2456
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,980
I think we're learning a lot about each other.

2457
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,120
Yeah, we're learning so much.

2458
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,840
When are we doing competitive League of Legends?

2459
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,840
Yes, please bro.

2460
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,940
Wow, my PC is gonna crash at that exact moment.

2461
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:34,720
How awkward.

2462
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,400
What are we like boot camping here?

2463
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,300
Like, surely this is just a training for something bigger, right?

2464
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:43,800
Probably.

2465
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,340
Yeah.

2466
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:44,980
Monopoly.

2467
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:45,880
Yeah, now that you're saying it.

2468
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,320
Yeah, we're training for... what was it called?

2469
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,520
The ninja thing?

2470
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,420
The ninja thing?

2471
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,620
Oh, American Ninja Warrior.

2472
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,860
American Ninja, yeah!

2473
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,520
Yeah, we're training for our own American Ninja.

2474
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,400
Oh my god.

2475
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,920
I watched that recently and the guy on there was like dressed as like his favorite Lord of the Rings character.

2476
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,720
And he like tried to jump off the first thing and he...

2477
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,500
He knows that!

2478
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,760
He was like, I've been training in my favorite characters.

2479
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,620
Like, who's the like sexy man from Lord of the Rings who like has a horse?

2480
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,740
I've never seen him.

2481
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:23,640
Oh, Eragor?

2482
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:23,900
No.

2483
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,440
Oh yeah, Eragor.

2484
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:25,580
Legolas?

2485
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,640
No, not Legolas.

2486
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,440
He's the black guy.

2487
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:27,460
Okay, sorry.

2488
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,400
I'm just like really into Legolas, so...

2489
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:29,840
Me as well.

2490
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,820
Eragor, that's fair.

2491
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,620
Eragor, he was like, Eragor is my soulmate.

2492
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,500
He is my character.

2493
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,760
He is just me depicted.

2494
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:38,760
He's my kin.

2495
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,220
He's my kin, Eragor.

2496
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,480
So I'm going to slay him.

2497
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,200
Parkour.

2498
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,720
He just like missed the rope and like dipped it into the water.

2499
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,600
And he had like chain mail and a coat and everything.

2500
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:50,440
It was so good.

2501
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,760
That's so sad.

2502
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,380
That's devastating, yeah.

2503
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,120
That poor guy.

2504
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,700
Hey, at least he got his like 10 minute of fame there.

2505
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:01,720
Is it even 10 minutes?

2506
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:01,780
10 minutes.

2507
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,520
No, it was like 30 seconds.

2508
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,620
30 seconds of fame.

2509
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,640
Yeah, but see, you remembered him though.

2510
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,920
You remembered him.

2511
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,480
He was the most impactful performer.

2512
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,320
Yeah, you don't even remember the other people.

2513
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,620
Like, who were the other guys?

2514
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,560
You don't know.

2515
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:19,920
Oh, no.

2516
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,860
John Parkour.

2517
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:24,380
John Parkour.

2518
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:24,880
What?

2519
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,100
Okay, we're back.

2520
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,580
All right, back to hell, I guess.

2521
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,120
You're so back.

2522
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,060
We're back to hell.

2523
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:31,560
We go.

2524
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:31,760
We go.

2525
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,060
What?

2526
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:34,820
What?

2527
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,180
It's the same thing.

2528
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,100
We're on top of each other.

2529
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,000
Oh, shit.

2530
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:38,420
Okay.

2531
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,940
There's no chutes.

2532
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,420
Oh, no.

2533
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:40,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

2534
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,000
The people on top of them.

2535
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:42,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

2536
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,320
They just go large for no reason.

2537
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,840
The people on top of the plane.

2538
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:45,540
If you're on top, don't move.

2539
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2540
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:46,900
Oh, shit.

2541
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,140
I swear to God.

2542
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:50,880
Don't move.

2543
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,620
Girl, I'm back.

2544
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:53,880
No, I'm back.

2545
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:54,660
Okay.

2546
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,240
It's okay.

2547
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:55,480
Ow.

2548
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:55,860
Ow.

2549
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,120
Sorry.

2550
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,040
What am I doing?

2551
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:01,340
Sorry.

2552
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,520
I just got back.

2553
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:03,860
Okay.

2554
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,580
Don't worry.

2555
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,240
All right.

2556
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:05,940
You and me, Mint.

2557
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:06,600
Yeah.

2558
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,580
There's no one on top of us.

2559
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,440
Guys, I'm not good at Touhou.

2560
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,140
I'm not good at Touhou.

2561
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,040
Guys, I'm not good at Touhou.

2562
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:10,460
My head.

2563
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:10,700
My head.

2564
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,900
I'm not good at Touhou.

2565
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,000
Yes, please.

2566
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,320
I can't beat Touhou.

2567
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,560
Watch out for the ceiling.

2568
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,100
Watch out for the ceiling.

2569
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,340
Oh, okay.

2570
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,220
I don't have to.

2571
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,080
All right, Amelie.

2572
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:19,320
Shoot.

2573
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,140
Yeah.

2574
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:21,700
Oh, my God.

2575
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:21,960
Oh, my God.

2576
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:22,920
I played Touhou.

2577
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:23,420
Okay.

2578
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,660
Don't shoot me.

2579
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:26,880
I don't have a person.

2580
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:32,180
All right, Lime.

2581
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:32,720
Let's go.

2582
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,040
Oh, what happened?

2583
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,580
Amelie, why did you walk off?

2584
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,740
If you get too close to the other ship, you can also knock off your little human.

2585
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:40,660
Oh, thank God.

2586
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,260
I'm just shooting.

2587
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,700
I'm a cat.

2588
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,060
Yeah.

2589
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,280
We're kind of crazy.

2590
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,360
Let's go, Snuffy.

2591
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:45,900
Oh.

2592
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,640
Oh, my God.

2593
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:48,260
Hello?

2594
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:52,660
Joki actually just threw a ball at the back of my skull.

2595
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,420
Oh, my God.

2596
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:55,400
Oh, my God.

2597
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,060
Oh, my God.

2598
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:56,940
Oh, my God.

2599
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,420
Oh, my God.

2600
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,100
Oh, my God.

2601
01:20:59,720 --> 01:20:59,880
Oh, my God.

2602
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:00,140
Oh, my God.

2603
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,260
Oh, my God.

2604
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,040
There we go.

2605
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:02,160
Okay.

2606
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:02,440
There we go.

2607
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:02,580
Okay.

2608
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:02,940
Bell.

2609
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:03,940
Shoot Bell.

2610
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:04,540
Shoot Bell.

2611
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:04,620
There we go.

2612
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,280
All right.

2613
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,080
Oh, great.

2614
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:08,180
Great.

2615
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:08,400
Great.

2616
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:08,560
Great.

2617
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:08,760
Great.

2618
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,160
Great.

2619
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,380
Oh, sorry.

2620
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,380
Oh, no.

2621
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,000
I think I just murdered Amelie.

2622
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,960
I just murdered her.

2623
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,880
In cold blood.

2624
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,760
Oh, I don't have a person.

2625
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:23,780
Oh.

2626
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:24,100
Oh, my God.

2627
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:24,420
My God.

2628
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:25,780
Jennifer, I can catch you.

2629
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,020
If you can't do Toho, then I can!

2630
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,820
See, I dodged all of that!

2631
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,760
It's not me!

2632
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,780
Wait, I was bored without a person!

2633
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,340
Wait, I was bored without a person!

2634
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,580
I was gonna jump on your head and trust your Toho!

2635
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,480
We're all bored without a person, okay?

2636
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,140
Okay, you're not stuck.

2637
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,380
Oh no, oh no!

2638
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:57,680
My head!

2639
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,100
No!

2640
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:01,300
Okay.

2641
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,720
Alright, Amelie.

2642
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,780
I'll get you through this, Amelie.

2643
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:08,560
Shoot!

2644
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:09,660
Shoot!

2645
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,500
Shoot, Amelie!

2646
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:11,700
Shoot!

2647
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,040
I'm gonna dash you!

2648
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:19,620
Violent!

2649
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:20,000
Violent!

2650
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,480
She's got you!

2651
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:22,740
She's got you!

2652
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:23,540
Yeah!

2653
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,240
That was so great!

2654
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:25,600
No one heard me!

2655
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,960
I didn't even move, I was clapping!

2656
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:31,920
You all heard me!

2657
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:32,940
I was literally like...

2658
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:33,880
I was just clapping!

2659
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,420
No one heard you!

2660
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,940
We got this!

2661
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,940
Yeah, we got this!

2662
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:38,500
We got this!

2663
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,900
Just clap!

2664
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,300
Nice, nice!

2665
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,380
I know!

2666
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,440
Shoot it!

2667
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,260
There we go!

2668
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:44,700
Very good!

2669
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,920
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

2670
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:46,560
Yellow!

2671
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,080
Yellow!

2672
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,200
Doggy!

2673
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:48,500
Doggy!

2674
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:49,040
Doggy!

2675
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:51,740
Oops!

2676
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,560
I think I just, like, stole your person and then also, like, killed you.

2677
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:56,520
And I was like...

2678
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,420
That's okay!

2679
01:22:58,820 --> 01:22:59,320
I know!

2680
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,360
I didn't do it!

2681
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,100
I didn't do it!

2682
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,020
I thought it was this ship.

2683
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:04,940
That's my bad.

2684
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:05,760
That's my bad.

2685
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,280
My person!

2686
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,080
I was found without a person!

2687
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:10,860
That pal?

2688
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:11,980
That pal?

2689
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,660
No, I knocked somebody else's person.

2690
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,560
Yeah, I have to steal somebody else's blood.

2691
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,980
I'm gonna take a baby.

2692
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:18,340
Do you have a USB?

2693
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,900
We should start jumping from car to car.

2694
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,080
I'm single and ready to mingle if anyone wants my car.

2695
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,060
Uh-oh.

2696
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:26,480
I have a...

2697
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,120
Uh-oh.

2698
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:27,700
Uh-oh.

2699
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,040
Uh-oh.

2700
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,240
A pretty Lamborghini.

2701
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,060
Okay, okay.

2702
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,740
Just keep spamming!

2703
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:33,840
Just keep spamming!

2704
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,460
Just keep shooting!

2705
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,360
I'm spamming!

2706
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:35,680
I'm spamming!

2707
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,680
Okay, where?

2708
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,080
Alright, alright.

2709
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:39,740
We're...

2710
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:39,940
Oh!

2711
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:40,700
Oh!

2712
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,200
No!

2713
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:41,860
No!

2714
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:42,220
Oh!

2715
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:42,440
No!

2716
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,060
I'm sorry!

2717
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:43,660
I'm sorry!

2718
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:44,120
I'm sorry!

2719
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,840
We lost two passages!

2720
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,200
We lost two!

2721
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,800
Oh my gosh!

2722
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:53,240
What happened?

2723
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,600
Not even nice.

2724
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,160
Not nice.

2725
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,640
Not nice.

2726
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,760
There we go.

2727
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:08,020
I don't feel comfortable at the tight passageway right there.

2728
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:12,640
Nice and easy.

2729
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,500
Nice and easy.

2730
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,800
Nice and easy.

2731
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,560
Guys, I'm all the way back here.

2732
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,460
Guys, guys.

2733
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,200
Boop me up!

2734
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:24,800
I got pushed off!

2735
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,060
I know.

2736
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,160
I know.

2737
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,200
Oh, thank god.

2738
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,480
I don't have to deal with passports.

2739
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,140
Somebody take...

2740
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,620
How did that happen?

2741
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:41,660
Take this!

2742
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:42,420
Take this!

2743
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:45,340
I left this in my pocket.

2744
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,060
Can you have it?

2745
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,520
I left this in my pocket.

2746
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:47,660
Can you have it?

2747
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:48,280
Nice!

2748
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:49,140
Nice!

2749
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,240
Who's first?

2750
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,220
Who needs to be first?

2751
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:53,120
Where's my orange?

2752
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,000
I got it!

2753
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,540
Go get it!

2754
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,200
Go get it!

2755
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:06,140
So the person has to jump off.

2756
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:06,380
So the person has to jump off.

2757
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:08,020
Alright, Amelie.

2758
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:09,460
You got this.

2759
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:09,940
I'm driving.

2760
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,080
You got this.

2761
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:11,800
Don't kill us.

2762
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:12,920
Oh my god.

2763
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:13,300
Oh my god.

2764
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,300
I'm so sorry, Doki.

2765
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:15,140
I'm so sorry.

2766
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:15,960
I was trying to dodge.

2767
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,940
Put me into the laser!

2768
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,980
I was entering a maze of maneuvers.

2769
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,140
Okay, I trust you guys.

2770
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:23,680
Okay.

2771
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,140
Okay.

2772
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,020
Goodbye, live.

2773
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,440
See you later, man.

2774
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:31,120
I'm gonna kidnap this person.

2775
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:31,700
I'm just shooting.

2776
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:31,920
I'm just shooting.

2777
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,200
Anyway, I started blasting.

2778
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,720
What if I just kidnap your person?

2779
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,180
Go!

2780
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:36,260
Go!

2781
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:36,440
Go!

2782
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,120
And then blue?

2783
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:39,960
And then blue?

2784
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:40,320
Yeah.

2785
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:40,680
Oh!

2786
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,760
Take it to the top!

2787
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,880
Okay, whatever.

2788
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,480
My bad.

2789
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,580
What the hell?

2790
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:50,960
My bad.

2791
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:51,740
My bad.

2792
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,160
My bad.

2793
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,760
I'm gonna put that on my soundboard.

2794
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,080
My bad.

2795
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,380
I'm a person.

2796
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:00,380
Arms of an angel.

2797
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,300
Where's this gonna land?

2798
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,900
My head is almost gonna touch it.

2799
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,260
There are things that are shooting us!

2800
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,300
Get out of the way!

2801
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:07,660
Pink!

2802
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:09,400
Pink!

2803
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:10,360
Pink!

2804
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:11,100
Pink!

2805
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,740
Go!

2806
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:13,700
Alright.

2807
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,200
Oh god.

2808
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:15,920
I'm so sorry.

2809
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:16,980
Baby down!

2810
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:17,860
Baby down!

2811
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:18,480
Baby down!

2812
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,760
We lost the baby!

2813
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,400
Baby down!

2814
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,460
Baby down!

2815
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,140
Go to the intersection again.

2816
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,540
Alright, Doki.

2817
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:29,960
Oh, sorry.

2818
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,480
Oh, sorry.

2819
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,180
Oh, sorry.

2820
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,560
What happened to Taro?

2821
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,820
I don't know!

2822
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,120
I'm so sorry.

2823
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:44,120
I'm so sorry.

2824
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:45,380
It's not okay, Blue.

2825
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:46,880
I have a dent.

2826
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:47,600
I have a dent.

2827
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,320
I have a dent.

2828
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,140
We lost the train tracks!

2829
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,680
We lost the train tracks!

2830
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,100
Okay, we're okay.

2831
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,000
Everything's okay.

2832
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:58,540
We can do this.

2833
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:00,960
My baby!

2834
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,140
My baby!

2835
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,320
My baby!

2836
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:03,620
I'll get you!

2837
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:04,340
I'll get you!

2838
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,140
We're okay.

2839
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,560
This is the real time.

2840
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,940
This is the real time.

2841
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:11,860
Okay.

2842
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:13,960
Go, Pink!

2843
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,220
Go!

2844
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,040
Alright, Red in position.

2845
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:18,840
Alright, Red!

2846
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:20,440
Alright, go!

2847
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:20,840
Red!

2848
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,320
No!

2849
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:22,200
Red!

2850
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:22,780
No!

2851
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,780
I had no room.

2852
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:29,680
I was just existing.

2853
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,860
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

2854
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,760
It's just practice, guys.

2855
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:36,960
It's just a trial run.

2856
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:37,500
Okay, red.

2857
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,040
And then orange.

2858
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,260
Okay, and then we just keep going down.

2859
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,840
There we go.

2860
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,600
Easy peasy.

2861
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,320
Yeah, see?

2862
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,140
Look at that.

2863
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,460
Not so difficult, guys.

2864
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,880
Just like that.

2865
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,820
Yeah, nice and easy.

2866
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,320
Nice and easy.

2867
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,580
Alright, who's first?

2868
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:56,940
Blue!

2869
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,940
Red, red, red.

2870
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:01,140
Red, you need to just depart, go get it.

2871
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:01,820
And then come back.

2872
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,600
Don't worry, I got you.

2873
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,580
Oh my god, it's right there!

2874
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:06,920
Look at that.

2875
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,100
It wouldn't be a shame if I just moved up just one space.

2876
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,000
Oh wait, how do we even do this?

2877
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,140
Passengers get off first.

2878
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,560
Passengers depart.

2879
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:18,820
Yeah!

2880
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:19,520
Yay!

2881
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,400
That was actually so clean, though.

2882
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,660
That was really clean.

2883
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,740
So clean.

2884
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,460
I didn't do anything.

2885
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:31,420
That was kind of chill.

2886
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:31,660
First try.

2887
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:33,580
Oh wait, what's this?

2888
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,320
Oh, I have power again!

2889
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:35,820
Yeah!

2890
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,840
We're really careful of shooting each other.

2891
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,040
Oh, this is so zoomed in.

2892
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:39,560
Oh!

2893
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:40,880
Go, go, go!

2894
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,020
Oh, weird, weird, weird, weird.

2895
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,560
Gray, gray, gray, gray.

2896
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,560
Uh oh.

2897
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,060
It's okay, it's okay.

2898
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,900
It's kind of fast, so it'll be okay.

2899
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,040
Okay, let's go.

2900
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:53,640
Gray?

2901
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,060
Okay, I got the yellow.

2902
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:57,520
I got the yellow.

2903
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,800
Okay, we're figuring it out.

2904
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,120
I'm gonna do a single file.

2905
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,580
I feel like we should do a single file.

2906
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,680
So we can just go up.

2907
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:11,660
Pink and yellow.

2908
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:15,400
We don't have to do both as long as like one section is clear.

2909
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,020
Red and orange.

2910
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,780
Or red.

2911
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:21,680
You look like a rubber duck.

2912
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:22,760
Oh yeah, we do.

2913
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:23,580
Oh, I'm trying.

2914
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,120
There we go.

2915
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,240
Nice, nice, nice.

2916
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,780
We're doing it.

2917
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:27,680
Orange and green.

2918
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,600
Oh, here we go.

2919
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:31,740
Oh, that was easy!

2920
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,720
So easy!

2921
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:34,620
Oh my god.

2922
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:35,820
So easy.

2923
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:36,520
Holy shit.

2924
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,920
We don't have passengers.

2925
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,040
Yeah.

2926
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,160
We're just left with our own devices.

2927
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,020
Yeah.

2928
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,500
We're just not very good at partners.

2929
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,500
Partner system.

2930
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,140
We can't have a buddy.

2931
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,040
Some people have shields.

2932
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,300
Okay, block this.

2933
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,000
I'll save you, my queen.

2934
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,200
Get behind us.

2935
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,100
Oh my god.

2936
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:02,840
The music stopped.

2937
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:07,680
What the fuck is that?

2938
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,420
We need the shield.

2939
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,020
We need the shield.

2940
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,100
Don't shoot the shield to the back.

2941
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,340
Oh, be careful shield.

2942
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:15,880
I can't.

2943
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,100
I'm too scared to shoot.

2944
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,300
I feel like I'm going to shoot somebody.

2945
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:20,340
Just shoot!

2946
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,140
Okay, oh, this is my...

2947
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:23,280
Sorry, my bad.

2948
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,800
You're so strong, Snuffy.

2949
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,380
You're so strong.

2950
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:29,320
Yeah!

2951
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,600
Guys, I feel like...

2952
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,200
Follow the shield!

2953
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:35,160
Follow the shield!

2954
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:35,840
Follow the shield!

2955
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,540
What the fuck?

2956
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,360
Oh my god.

2957
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,140
I did not expect that.

2958
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,140
We're so good at this.

2959
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:44,880
Oh, oh, oh.

2960
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:48,340
Don't worry, we have...

2961
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:50,160
Yeah, yeah, just have them eat all the...

2962
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,460
Yeah, eat it, eat it, eat it.

2963
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,480
Eat it, eat it, eat it.

2964
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,780
That's fucking right.

2965
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:57,940
The ice shield!

2966
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:01,780
We're so close!

2967
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:03,680
We did so good.

2968
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,520
Okay, that first try was pretty good.

2969
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,320
Okay.

2970
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:07,660
Okay.

2971
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,880
I'm already damaged.

2972
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,380
I'm fine, I'm fine.

2973
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:14,740
You can actually recover.

2974
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,880
Yeah, eventually, yeah.

2975
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,860
Okay, I'm just going to shoot from here.

2976
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,480
Gamer, stay behind me.

2977
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:22,520
Oh, don't shoot me, sorry.

2978
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:23,800
Don't shoot me.

2979
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:27,260
If you're staying behind the shield, don't shoot.

2980
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,160
You're going to have to like...

2981
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,760
You're going to have to move a little bit.

2982
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,560
Gamer's got to be careful.

2983
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,620
Gamer's got to learn trigger safety and discipline.

2984
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,780
Oh shit, sorry, Gamer.

2985
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,440
It feels like Pond right here.

2986
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:40,420
No!

2987
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,260
Okay, okay.

2988
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,520
Stay behind, stay behind!

2989
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,480
Get behind!

2990
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:46,240
Get behind me!

2991
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,660
Get behind me!

2992
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,740
Okay, Gamer, spread out.

2993
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:54,660
Spread out, Gamer.

2994
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,260
V formation, Gamer.

2995
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,620
V formation, Gamer.

2996
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,680
Oh, we're so close.

2997
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:00,760
Oh my god, okay.

2998
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,420
Guys, don't shoot the shields.

2999
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,220
It's all we need to do.

3000
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:05,880
V formation, V formation.

3001
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,240
I'm focused, I'm focused.

3002
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:08,800
Oh no!

3003
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,560
Oh no!

3004
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,360
Stand behind the shield if there's a missile.

3005
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,940
Orange, you need to block the missiles.

3006
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,180
No, they don't.

3007
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:16,880
They just stay there.

3008
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,080
They just stay there.

3009
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,220
Don't over complicate it.

3010
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,140
Don't over complicate it.

3011
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,080
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

3012
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,580
We're fine, we're fine.

3013
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,540
No, no, no, no.

3014
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,580
V formation!

3015
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,600
Watch out, Gamers!

3016
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:47,300
What happened?

3017
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:48,280
What happened?

3018
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,240
The missile got me.

3019
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,680
The missile is one shot.

3020
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,540
The missile is one shot.

3021
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:56,840
We were so close.

3022
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,040
Alright, Gamers.

3023
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,200
Be careful.

3024
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:01,440
I'll eat as much as you can.

3025
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,400
I'll eat as much as I can, Gamers.

3026
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:03,240
I'll eat as much as I can.

3027
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:07,480
I'll eat as much as I can, Gamers.

3028
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:09,160
I believe in you, man.

3029
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,820
I believe in you.

3030
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,900
You just flicked the back of my head last week.

3031
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,500
I just like the color of your ship.

3032
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,760
Because I gotta eat it!

3033
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,120
I gotta eat it!

3034
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:22,800
I'm sorry.

3035
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,740
Get behind us, Gamers!

3036
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:26,360
Get behind us!

3037
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:26,960
Get behind!

3038
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:29,860
Got you!

3039
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,320
Did you shoot the shield guy?

3040
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:36,000
Did you shoot the shield guy?

3041
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:37,500
Yeah, he deserved it.

3042
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,560
Alright, we're gonna eat as much as we can.

3043
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,040
Alright, we're gonna eat as much as we can.

3044
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,800
Oh, this one shot, by the way, the missile is one shot!

3045
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,680
Oh, this one shot, by the way, the missile is one shot!

3046
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,040
Be careful, guys!

3047
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:45,760
Be careful!

3048
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:47,560
I learned it the hard way!

3049
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,300
Eating as much as I can!

3050
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:51,560
Here we go.

3051
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,620
Oh, eat it, eat it!

3052
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:54,920
It's delicious, eat it!

3053
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:55,480
No!

3054
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,340
Who killed me?

3055
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,000
Oh, okay.

3056
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,960
Because you're really good at it!

3057
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,080
Okay, never mind.

3058
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,300
Okay, never mind.

3059
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,460
Never mind.

3060
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,980
The game knows!

3061
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:19,920
It won't let me play the game!

3062
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:24,500
Alright, here we go.

3063
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:26,540
Alright, Gamers, we're here!

3064
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,800
They can't do anything to us!

3065
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:32,060
They can't do anything to us!

3066
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:32,280
Yeah!

3067
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:33,740
Oh, ouch!

3068
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,500
Too close!

3069
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:38,700
We were too close.

3070
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,160
This guy just, like, assassinated our shield.

3071
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:41,740
Oh, there you go!

3072
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,040
Back at it again!

3073
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:46,000
Oh my god!

3074
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,220
You're just really good at it!

3075
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,920
The game knows!

3076
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,700
Yeah, you're so good at tanking!

3077
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,580
Okay, we have the system down.

3078
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:56,760
Alright, Gamers.

3079
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:00,840
We have...

3080
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:01,880
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3081
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:02,760
Don't be too close.

3082
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,980
I don't think you guys have to move.

3083
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,200
You guys can literally just...

3084
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,240
stay there.

3085
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,080
Yeah, yeah, like, we don't have to...

3086
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,060
You don't have to...

3087
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:10,060
Oh.

3088
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,900
That's why we were moving a little bit.

3089
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:13,540
But it's okay.

3090
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:14,660
We stay like this.

3091
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:15,600
We provide a safe zone.

3092
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:16,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3093
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,780
And then we can move from the others.

3094
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:20,260
Okay, now we go back.

3095
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:22,020
Alright, behind us, behind us.

3096
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,840
This is one shot.

3097
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:24,660
You die instantly.

3098
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:27,720
Alright, nice.

3099
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,780
We got this.

3100
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,220
We got this.

3101
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,300
Halfway.

3102
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,180
What is the lore of Pico Park?

3103
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,900
We're at a park.

3104
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,380
It's like...

3105
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:38,140
It's like Chuck E.

3106
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:39,160
Cheese, but like...

3107
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:40,800
a little more dangerous.

3108
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,320
Okay.

3109
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,840
This is where I drop my kids off?

3110
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:44,960
Yeah, this is where...

3111
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,500
Yeah, this Pico Park...

3112
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,020
We gotta head to the Pico Park.

3113
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,200
Damn.

3114
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:52,760
Are we gonna move for the missiles?

3115
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,540
I think just a little bit is okay.

3116
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,400
Be careful.

3117
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,300
I got it.

3118
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,160
Behind us, behind us, behind us.

3119
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:00,440
Missile time, missile time.

3120
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:04,540
The missile is getting very easy.

3121
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,200
Our hero.

3122
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:07,980
Our hero.

3123
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:08,900
Okay.

3124
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:09,320
Alright, gamers.

3125
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:10,760
We got this.

3126
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,960
I can't block that.

3127
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:14,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3128
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:15,920
I'm trying.

3129
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,680
I got him.

3130
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,500
Missile time.

3131
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,420
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

3132
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,460
I'll eat it, I'll eat it.

3133
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,700
Oh, oh, oh.

3134
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,420
So close, so close, so close.

3135
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,920
Just gotta regen, regen.

3136
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,900
I like how Amelie is just behind me.

3137
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:40,020
Stop, stop shooting, stop shooting.

3138
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,200
I'm so scared.

3139
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:49,660
I just needed one more shot and I'd be dead.

3140
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,360
I'm so scared.

3141
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:55,180
Yay!

3142
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,280
Yay!

3143
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:58,380
Yay!

3144
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,740
This is like the hardest part.

3145
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,040
I know, right?

3146
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,700
Oh my god, this is like a walk in the park.

3147
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,080
Oh my god, I finished one area!

3148
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,540
And one entire row!

3149
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,260
Oh my god, look how close we are.

3150
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,220
Look how close we are, guys.

3151
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,180
We're just getting better.

3152
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,260
Let's go to the shadow realm level.

3153
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:16,580
Let's go.

3154
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:17,520
Yeah.

3155
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,120
Let's go to the shadow realm.

3156
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,080
After this, we can use shadow realm.

3157
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:21,600
What's this?

3158
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,540
Don't hit it, don't hit it, I think.

3159
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:26,720
It's too cute.

3160
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:28,900
Wait, what are the people on the top?

3161
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,980
I think it's the people that are moving are the ones up top.

3162
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:32,700
Oh!

3163
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,280
Oh, it's like a snitch.

3164
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,640
Like who's...

3165
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,140
Oh, because it's stop and go.

3166
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,080
We have to go.

3167
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:41,840
What?

3168
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:43,140
Jump over it.

3169
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,360
I thought he was going to keep going.

3170
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,020
I don't know.

3171
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:52,300
Maybe the person on the top can kill it?

3172
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:54,680
Maybe the person on the top can kill it?

3173
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,700
I can't jump over it.

3174
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,340
We need guns.

3175
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,260
Let's just hop over it.

3176
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,740
Wait, can we all move at the same time?

3177
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,580
No, only four people can move.

3178
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,100
Only four can...

3179
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,480
Oh, we can jump on top!

3180
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:10,840
Wait, did we go?

3181
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,660
How come he's killed me like ten times?

3182
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,540
The front four move.

3183
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,780
Yeah, yeah.

3184
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,400
Nice.

3185
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:19,960
Alright.

3186
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,380
One at a time.

3187
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:26,820
No, we could just have one person on top and then...

3188
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:27,000
Now go.

3189
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:27,640
Now go.

3190
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:32,000
Oh, it's only three at a time.

3191
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:32,820
It's four.

3192
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:33,500
Oh, it is four.

3193
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:34,180
Alright.

3194
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,400
Don't die to the laser.

3195
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:39,800
I made a realization.

3196
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:41,240
Oh, no, no.

3197
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:41,620
Oh, dear.

3198
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,060
Someone jump over me.

3199
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,880
Can you just jump straight down to get the key?

3200
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:49,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3201
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:49,920
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3202
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:50,480
Nice, nice.

3203
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:52,320
Oh, but it is a treadmill.

3204
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,340
Okay, I'll go.

3205
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:55,580
Oh.

3206
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,380
Let's just go at the far end and then let go.

3207
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,260
Okay, we have four people moving now, so be careful.

3208
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:01,300
Okay.

3209
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,260
I do not know where...

3210
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:04,580
Oh, shoot.

3211
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:05,560
Hold on.

3212
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:06,940
There we go.

3213
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,680
Oh, it is a treadmill.

3214
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:09,540
This went down two or two.

3215
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:10,400
Oh, my God.

3216
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,160
You just gonna have to coordinate it so we're all moving.

3217
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:14,700
Oh, God.

3218
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:14,940
Okay.

3219
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,280
This is fine.

3220
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:17,040
We got this.

3221
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:17,840
Can we push people?

3222
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:18,600
No.

3223
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,320
Okay, that's good.

3224
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:20,640
That's good.

3225
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,240
We already got one person out of the treadmill.

3226
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,720
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

3227
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:24,520
I'm just gonna stop.

3228
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:25,540
They just have to not move.

3229
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:26,460
Okay, okay.

3230
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,680
Okay, there we go.

3231
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:29,060
Yeah.

3232
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:31,140
Oh, and then that's good.

3233
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,620
We got four.

3234
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,040
Oh, my God.

3235
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,160
Nice.

3236
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:34,260
Oh,

3237
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:38,480
my God.

3238
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:38,760
Easy.

3239
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:39,520
Easy.

3240
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:41,060
So easy.

3241
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,560
And then we push it.

3242
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:43,340
Push, push, push, push.

3243
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:44,560
Okay, I have the key.

3244
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:44,900
Nice.

3245
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:45,620
Now jump up.

3246
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:46,920
Oh, yeah.

3247
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,360
Fucking easiest level.

3248
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:49,660
Nice.

3249
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:50,380
Yay.

3250
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,440
Oh, my God.

3251
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,360
You know what?

3252
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,020
That was so easy.

3253
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:01,860
That was so easy.

3254
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:03,460
We might as well do the dark level.

3255
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,200
Which one is it?

3256
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:07,720
Is it...

3257
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:08,860
Is this?

3258
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:09,680
That one?

3259
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,100
It looks like...

3260
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:10,740
Special Park?

3261
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:12,540
That's us.

3262
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:13,720
We're Special Park.

3263
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,620
That would be us.

3264
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,640
Is that it?

3265
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:19,020
We actually did, like, one of the levels in Special Park.

3266
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:20,580
Wait.

3267
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:22,720
Oh, that's the one with the button!

3268
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,220
Remember when Min...

3269
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,620
This is fucking cursed, man.

3270
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:26,700
What is this?

3271
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,840
What does that mean?

3272
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,040
So, wait.

3273
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,340
White, orange, and blue?

3274
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,440
Are those us?

3275
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,340
Are those other players?

3276
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:35,580
Oh, I'm blue!

3277
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:36,060
I'm blue!

3278
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:37,320
Okay, so we need...

3279
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:38,360
I'm blue.

3280
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:40,940
We need six people to do blue.

3281
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,660
What does this even mean?

3282
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:44,900
It's right and left.

3283
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:44,900
Oh!

3284
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,780
Okay, I can do orange.

3285
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:48,140
Yeah.

3286
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,300
So, it's depending if you go left or right.

3287
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:51,680
Yeah.

3288
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,300
Oh, so, like, left, middle, right?

3289
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,220
We have to map it to the left.

3290
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:59,540
Oh, the animation they're doing.

3291
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,060
Okay.

3292
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:01,240
What the...

3293
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,360
How the hell do we do this?

3294
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,860
So, Bow, I think you can turn to the right and jump.

3295
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:07,020
So, I'm moving left.

3296
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:07,860
I'm moving left.

3297
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,060
We need two more people moving left.

3298
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:12,260
I'm doing it.

3299
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,080
How do we get grey?

3300
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,900
We just face left side.

3301
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,520
Because if you jump, you float.

3302
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:19,140
Ah, I see.

3303
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,280
We need one more person moving left.

3304
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,240
We need one more person moving left and then jumping.

3305
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:25,820
I think all of... wait.

3306
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,980
Only six people need to be jumping.

3307
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:29,800
Whoever is orange...

3308
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,580
I moved left and jumped.

3309
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:35,680
You can jump and move left at the same time.

3310
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:36,280
Yeah, yeah.

3311
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:37,800
Jump and move left at the same time.

3312
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,180
We need one more person doing whatever orange is doing.

3313
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,080
What the fuck is orange doing?

3314
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:42,940
Just moving right.

3315
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,600
Oh, okay.

3316
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,180
Somebody move grey!

3317
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,080
Somebody move grey!

3318
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:51,760
We were so close.

3319
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,920
We almost figured it out.

3320
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,180
My brain.

3321
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,040
Okay, I'm going to move left.

3322
01:41:59,200 --> 01:41:59,980
I moved left too.

3323
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,600
I went right.

3324
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,360
I'm orange.

3325
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:02,340
I'm doing orange.

3326
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,220
We need somebody to move left.

3327
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:06,020
Oh!

3328
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:07,940
Too many orange.

3329
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:09,720
Alright, wait.

3330
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,420
Okay, we need somebody to jump.

3331
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:15,700
Somebody...

3332
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,880
We need two more people to jump.

3333
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,960
Green, can you jump?

3334
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:22,500
Yeah, I guess.

3335
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:23,140
Hold on.

3336
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:24,840
There we go.

3337
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,420
And we need an orange.

3338
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,720
And we need a grey.

3339
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:30,340
We need one more orange.

3340
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:31,720
Um...

3341
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:32,400
Um...

3342
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,560
Oh my god.

3343
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:36,980
Are we missing somebody?

3344
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:38,900
Somebody is not...

3345
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,360
Somebody... Okay.

3346
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:43,720
One more person on orange.

3347
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:44,920
So you need to be right.

3348
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,080
Like going right.

3349
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:50,380
You can jump and move a direction at the same time.

3350
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:50,980
What the fuck?

3351
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:53,140
Oh, there's several!

3352
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:56,120
Okay, everybody look to the left.

3353
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,700
And one person jump.

3354
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,480
And that's it.

3355
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,640
What the fuck is this?

3356
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:02,820
Help.

3357
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:03,820
Help.

3358
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,500
Oh, there we go.

3359
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,960
Everybody look to the right.

3360
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:09,900
Nobody jump.

3361
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:11,200
Don't jump.

3362
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,540
Everybody just look to the right.

3363
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,120
Okay.

3364
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,280
Oh, that was so close.

3365
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,260
Oh, there we go.

3366
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:22,680
Why is there more?

3367
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:23,860
Why is there more?

3368
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:25,760
I'm crying.

3369
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:30,400
We got stuck on the first one for so long.

3370
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,640
We get it now.

3371
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:33,500
We get it now.

3372
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,700
This is special.

3373
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:39,880
Okay, I'm moving to the right and I'm jumping.

3374
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:40,640
We need one more.

3375
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:41,920
Oh, and I'm jumping.

3376
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:44,260
We need one more right to move to the right.

3377
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:44,860
Okay, nice.

3378
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:48,240
I'm moving to the right and I'm...

3379
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:49,540
I'm moving to the left.

3380
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,260
We need one person to move to the right.

3381
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,800
One more to the left.

3382
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,880
One just left.

3383
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:58,360
I'm going just left.

3384
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,760
Who's not doing it?

3385
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,260
Who's not moving at all?

3386
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,800
I'm moving to the right.

3387
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,640
I'm moving to the left.

3388
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,100
We need somebody to jump.

3389
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:09,340
Okay, I jump.

3390
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,900
We need one more person to jump.

3391
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:14,460
One more person to jump.

3392
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,040
Okay, there we go.

3393
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,020
Okay, the pie chart.

3394
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,340
Okay, I'm jumping.

3395
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:21,920
I'm on the right.

3396
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:23,360
Perfect.

3397
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:24,280
Nailed it.

3398
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,560
I'm right jumping.

3399
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,120
I'm jumping right.

3400
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:29,100
Oh, nice.

3401
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,080
Four more.

3402
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:30,380
Four more.

3403
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,800
Okay, everybody to the left.

3404
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:35,260
Everybody to the right.

3405
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,420
Right side.

3406
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,060
Pie chart time.

3407
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:39,160
Oh, wait.

3408
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:41,920
No jumping.

3409
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:42,500
No jumping.

3410
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:46,480
Okay, one person.

3411
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,980
Only one person needs to do it.

3412
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:48,760
Only one person.

3413
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:51,540
One person needs to do it.

3414
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,520
No, actually not one.

3415
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,380
Oh, no, no, no.

3416
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:54,960
Stop jumping.

3417
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:56,280
Stop jumping.

3418
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:58,680
Who's jumping?

3419
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,660
Criss-cross now.

3420
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:08,600
Slide to the left.

3421
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,060
We're so close.

3422
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:14,860
Nice.

3423
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:16,240
Okay, jump.

3424
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,380
No going to the right.

3425
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,360
No going to the right.

3426
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:20,560
There we go.

3427
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:20,960
Okay.

3428
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,000
Now, only going to the right and jumping.

3429
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:24,460
Now, only going to the right and jumping.

3430
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:25,820
Okay, who's going to the left?

3431
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:27,860
Who's got it?

3432
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:30,500
There we go.

3433
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:31,580
We did it.

3434
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,500
I will go left.

3435
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,280
We need one more right.

3436
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:39,780
Gosh, they're really just kind of...

3437
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:39,840
Gosh, they're really just kind of...

3438
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:41,720
Okay, nice.

3439
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,740
I feel like that one's easier to juke.

3440
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,080
Okay, nice.

3441
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,140
Nice, nice.

3442
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,340
I'm on right side.

3443
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:51,060
No jumping.

3444
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:51,160
Go to the back.

3445
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:52,240
Jumping back.

3446
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:53,700
Jumping back.

3447
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:55,440
Left, left, left.

3448
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:56,820
We need one more left.

3449
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:57,580
Okay.

3450
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:58,520
Alright.

3451
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:02,360
One person goes to the left.

3452
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:04,320
We did it.

3453
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,720
We're figuring stuff out.

3454
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:06,720
Nice, nice, nice.

3455
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:07,940
Everybody jump.

3456
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,700
I'm jumping right.

3457
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,080
We need one more right.

3458
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,820
One more left.

3459
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,180
It's still timed.

3460
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:19,320
Go, go, go, go.

3461
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:20,420
Go, go, go, go.

3462
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:23,320
Jesus Christ.

3463
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:25,540
I think Dark Park...

3464
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:28,120
My brain hurts.

3465
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,580
My brain hurts.

3466
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:32,040
I think Dark Park only exists.

3467
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,340
I told you a little jumping slice appeared and I would look down about.

3468
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:35,380
It was just one jump.

3469
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,740
Oh, this is fun.

3470
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:38,860
Pinball.

3471
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,260
We're playing pinball.

3472
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,040
This is going to be fun.

3473
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:43,260
This is going to be fun.

3474
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,980
This is going to be fun.

3475
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,000
Bow.

3476
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,040
That wasn't me.

3477
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,280
It's fine.

3478
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:53,640
We can coordinate this.

3479
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,980
This is all on your own.

3480
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,640
No teamwork needed is reflexes.

3481
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,000
Yeah, no teamwork needed.

3482
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,300
No to blame.

3483
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:03,280
You miss your individually bad at the game.

3484
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:04,520
Yay!

3485
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:08,080
Gamers, gamers.

3486
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,080
Gamers.

3487
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:14,580
At least we proved to everybody that we're gamers.

3488
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,820
Yeah, we're good at this.

3489
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:16,900
Thank you.

3490
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:17,260
Yeah.

3491
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,980
You guys, that was my brain cell rattling around my skull.

3492
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,060
Gamers confirmed.

3493
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,000
Gamers confirmed.

3494
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,800
That's a lot of dudes.

3495
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,880
Wait, what do you fucking mean?

3496
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:28,560
Oh, no.

3497
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:29,860
I know who I am.

3498
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:30,340
I know.

3499
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,360
I found me.

3500
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:31,420
I know who I am.

3501
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,120
I know who I am.

3502
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,240
I found me.

3503
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:35,460
I got me.

3504
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,660
I found me.

3505
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:38,300
Okay.

3506
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:41,280
I don't know.

3507
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,160
Where am I?

3508
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,580
Oh, oh.

3509
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:48,460
Oh, the turns!

3510
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:50,820
Wait, what?

3511
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:51,340
Turns?

3512
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,340
No, I think you're supposed to...

3513
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:56,640
Oh, I just picked the wrong one because I thought it was like...

3514
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:56,960
I found you.

3515
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,660
I found you.

3516
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:00,480
We all have to fight each other.

3517
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:02,020
I picked the one above me.

3518
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:02,980
Okay, I found me.

3519
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:03,300
I found me.

3520
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,920
I found who I am.

3521
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:05,280
Oh, no.

3522
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,660
I thought I found me, but I think I was wrong.

3523
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:08,240
No.

3524
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:12,720
Okay, okay.

3525
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,940
Okay, we can do this, guys.

3526
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:16,220
I found me.

3527
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:18,120
Oh, shoot.

3528
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,020
Yeah, me too.

3529
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:19,920
I found me.

3530
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,120
I found me too.

3531
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:22,840
I found me.

3532
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,640
Alright, I stopped moving when I found myself.

3533
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,180
Just stop moving when you find yourself.

3534
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:29,220
Okay.

3535
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,740
I need to go on a journey of self-discovery.

3536
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:35,080
I'm finding myself.

3537
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,600
Oh, we did it.

3538
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,020
We found ourselves.

3539
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:41,140
I found myself.

3540
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,880
You are an individual.

3541
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:50,160
We're all special, guys.

3542
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:51,540
We're all special, guys.

3543
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:51,680
We're all special, guys.

3544
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,540
We're all special, guys.

3545
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:55,480
Alright, back to stop and go.

3546
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:58,060
Alright, back to stop and go.

3547
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,160
Wait, I think we are...

3548
01:48:59,160 --> 01:48:59,240
Oh.

3549
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,160
Oh, it's red light, green light.

3550
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,300
Oh, it's red light, green light.

3551
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:05,660
Okay, guys.

3552
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:06,420
We got to not move.

3553
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,180
Wait for him to turn around.

3554
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,000
Wait for him to turn around.

3555
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:15,980
Okay, guys.

3556
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:15,980
We got to not move.

3557
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:16,480
I think he's red.

3558
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:17,340
Turn around.

3559
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:21,840
If he goes red, you stop, I think.

3560
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:22,020
If he goes red, you stop, I think.

3561
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,280
I don't think he's going to go...

3562
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,680
I think this one person nudges very slowly.

3563
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,280
I think this one person nudges very slowly.

3564
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,460
Maybe we don't look at him?

3565
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,080
Oh, no.

3566
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:35,840
That's like bad aim.

3567
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:36,640
I say that.

3568
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:40,980
I say that.

3569
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:41,220
Alright.

3570
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:45,360
I think it's just one person at a time.

3571
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:45,820
Can we look?

3572
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:47,300
Can we conga line?

3573
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,780
Oh, it might be one person.

3574
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:49,840
Oh, hey guys.

3575
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,260
I win.

3576
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:53,500
Maybe it's a one person thing.

3577
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:53,820
Yeah.

3578
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:55,540
Okay, so just the person in the front.

3579
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:56,980
No!

3580
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:57,920
Donkey!

3581
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:02,760
I thought I was in the front.

3582
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,240
Technically, I'm in the front.

3583
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:06,360
Out of all the game modes, this is going to be...

3584
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,240
I'm always going to be...

3585
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,140
It's okay.

3586
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,120
Just go.

3587
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:09,840
Just go.

3588
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,400
Okay, now Amelie goes.

3589
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,120
Now I'm going to go.

3590
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:15,840
Now I'm going to go.

3591
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:16,760
Okay.

3592
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,260
It would be funny if I just move right now.

3593
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:21,160
I'm stopping now.

3594
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:22,600
I'm going.

3595
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:23,160
I'm going.

3596
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:24,340
Red rover!

3597
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,160
Red rover!

3598
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,500
Send mint over.

3599
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:31,600
Joopy!

3600
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:32,980
Alright.

3601
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:34,680
Donkey.

3602
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,700
Wait, he might turn around, so be careful.

3603
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:40,520
I'm going to unlock the door.

3604
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:41,900
I don't want to go one at a time.

3605
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:42,880
Yeah, I think so too.

3606
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:46,360
This is like teaching manners, honestly.

3607
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,560
Wait for your turn.

3608
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:52,780
Yeah!

3609
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:53,420
Kind of hard.

3610
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:55,660
We did it!

3611
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:59,860
We're starting in a kindergarten now.

3612
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:02,480
Good job, class.

3613
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:03,820
It's harder than it looks, you guys.

3614
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,280
Single file line.

3615
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:05,980
We're going to the bathrooms.

3616
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,920
Okay, what's this?

3617
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:09,460
Oh boy.

3618
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,080
Oh.

3619
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:14,400
Wait, isn't this the one level we have to avoid?

3620
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:15,800
We shouldn't do, right?

3621
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:18,600
We can only move when the light turns out.

3622
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:19,980
Or when it turns all white.

3623
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,040
Or am I like fading in and out of consciousness?

3624
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:22,300
No, you're right.

3625
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,260
It is restarting.

3626
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,340
Oh yeah, you can only move when it's on.

3627
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,060
Wait, isn't this the level that people tell us not to do?

3628
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:32,400
Oh, this might be the level that flashes.

3629
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,420
Yeah, yeah.

3630
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:35,540
I don't think we should do this one.

3631
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:37,180
Okay, we can skip it.

3632
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:39,500
Wait, it says we can finish game.

3633
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:40,520
Does it pass it?

3634
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,200
Does it automatically finish it for us?

3635
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,700
Wait, I want to see.

3636
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,140
It says we can finish game.

3637
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:48,920
But I don't know if it automatically...

3638
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,340
finish end game.

3639
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:52,540
Let's just go.

3640
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:53,180
Oh!

3641
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:55,600
You can't!

3642
01:51:55,940 --> 01:52:01,440
I thought it would finish it for us!

3643
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:01,980
I thought it would finish it for us!

3644
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:02,820
I thought it would finish it for us!

3645
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:03,460
Yo, Will!

3646
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:05,500
Are you kidding me?

3647
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,280
Are you kidding me?

3648
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,960
Sorry, I'll make a new one.

3649
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:11,800
That's why I'm bad at games.

3650
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:13,560
That's why I'm bad.

3651
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,440
I think I get it now.

3652
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,300
Now that I know what finish...

3653
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:19,460
I thought it would actually...

3654
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,100
It would make us let us finish the level.

3655
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:24,780
And I'll be like, whoa, that's cool.

3656
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,040
Game finished.

3657
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:32,520
Alright, I put the new code in.

3658
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,820
Don't leak the code.

3659
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:35,720
Don't leak the code.

3660
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:37,420
No leakers.

3661
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:41,600
Are we dodging that level?

3662
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,640
Is it giving people headaches?

3663
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,180
Yeah, I think we should dodge it.

3664
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:47,120
It's probably not good for people watching.

3665
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:47,760
Yeah.

3666
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:51,440
It's sort of like, not exactly like fast flashing.

3667
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,980
But it's definitely disorientating.

3668
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,860
It's not for our sakes.

3669
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:55,760
It's for the viewers.

3670
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,500
We're worried about you guys.

3671
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,420
We're so worried about you guys.

3672
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:05,380
I only care about chat.

3673
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:06,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3674
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,040
2, 4...

3675
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,640
Guys, stop, stop.

3676
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:12,920
2, 4... Okay, we're missing one.

3677
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:13,480
There you go.

3678
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:16,900
Please, I can't count.

3679
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:19,740
You know, there is a counter in the corner.

3680
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,600
It says, 7 out of 7.

3681
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,440
Never trust technology.

3682
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:33,060
Okay, go get the apples.

3683
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:33,860
I've got apples.

3684
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,060
Oh, f%%&n, hell.

3685
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,700
I've got an apple.

3686
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,340
Shut this one.

3687
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,100
We have to make sure everybody has an apple.

3688
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:43,400
Guys, we can't just give it to Mip.

3689
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,940
Everybody needs to have an apple.

3690
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,380
Sorry, I'm just so good at catching them.

3691
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:48,960
Apple.

3692
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,040
Give me the apple.

3693
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:51,340
Wait, how many apples?

3694
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:54,580
I'm really good at catching these apples 34.

3695
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,460
Oh, we got 13.

3696
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,020
Keep catching, keep catching.

3697
01:53:58,020 --> 01:53:59,380
I'm catching apples.

3698
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:00,340
I'm trying!

3699
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,300
Ten!

3700
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:01,660
Apple.

3701
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:02,760
Oh.

3702
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,260
Apple.

3703
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:05,400
Okay, maybe shoot them when we're close by.

3704
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:06,140
Alright.

3705
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:06,680
Four more!

3706
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,680
They go really far.

3707
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:09,420
Apple.

3708
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:09,680
Okay.

3709
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:10,700
Two to two.

3710
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:11,220
I'm shot one.

3711
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,160
Okay.

3712
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:15,240
Go go go!

3713
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,140
Go go go!

3714
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:17,960
Nice.

3715
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:18,360
Okay.

3716
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:18,740
Nice.

3717
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:19,840
First try, baby!

3718
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,860
We're doing so good!

3719
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,740
We're like first try.

3720
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:23,280
I know!

3721
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,820
We are gamers!

3722
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:27,880
We're better than flesh and blood.

3723
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:28,000
We're better than flesh and blood.

3724
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:28,620
We're really fine.

3725
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:32,160
What's this?

3726
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:33,160
Yay!

3727
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:33,880
More balls!

3728
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,280
What do you do here?

3729
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:35,920
I don't know.

3730
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:36,980
We catch it and then we shoot it.

3731
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:37,700
We're gonna shoot it.

3732
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:38,840
We're gonna shoot it in the basket.

3733
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:39,660
It's like basketball.

3734
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:40,220
We're gonna basketball this.

3735
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:41,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3736
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:41,400
Oh!

3737
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:42,880
Here we go.

3738
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:43,900
Oh god.

3739
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:44,820
I got one.

3740
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:45,840
Oh god.

3741
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,060
This is actually convoluting.

3742
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:47,240
Oh, what the hell?

3743
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,640
Oh, if you drop it, you lose it.

3744
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,860
I formally request you get off my head.

3745
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:51,220
Thank you.

3746
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:52,260
Oh, okay.

3747
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,260
I just stole that.

3748
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:55,300
How do I get it in?

3749
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:56,040
What the freak?

3750
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:57,200
No!

3751
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,620
You set the angle, then you set the power.

3752
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:00,780
Oh, I don't like this.

3753
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:01,380
Yeah.

3754
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:03,280
Oh, people can get in the way of your balls.

3755
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:03,860
Oh!

3756
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:05,360
I hate this one.

3757
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:05,940
This one sucks.

3758
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,200
You guys can, like, smack them out of other people's head.

3759
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:11,420
Guys, we gotta work together, guys.

3760
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:13,200
We gotta...

3761
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,140
Oh, come on.

3762
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:14,820
We got...

3763
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:15,840
Oh my god!

3764
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:16,400
That thing's...

3765
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,040
We're smacking it!

3766
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:21,140
I haven't gotten a single ball.

3767
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,540
I got two in.

3768
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:23,980
I'm doing my part.

3769
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:24,680
I haven't gotten a single ball.

3770
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,940
I'm actually gonna throw up.

3771
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,080
I can't do this anymore.

3772
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:27,780
I can't do this anymore.

3773
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:27,980
I can't do this anymore.

3774
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:29,600
I'm doing my part.

3775
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:31,020
Oh, look at that.

3776
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:32,200
I got all of it.

3777
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:34,300
I love this game.

3778
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,520
It feels like we're playing those arcade basketball games.

3779
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:36,920
Yeah.

3780
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:40,160
I hate these.

3781
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:41,120
No!

3782
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,200
You ain't trying.

3783
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,060
Collecting balls.

3784
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,480
I'm collecting balls.

3785
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:45,320
Oh, wait.

3786
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:45,640
I got one.

3787
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:46,620
Spare balls?

3788
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,360
I got one, too!

3789
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:47,580
Wait, I'm crazy.

3790
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:48,840
Oh my god.

3791
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:49,080
No.

3792
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:50,400
Oh god.

3793
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,080
Oh, son of a...

3794
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,000
Shit.

3795
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:52,660
Oh, fuck.

3796
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:53,960
I saw that.

3797
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:54,440
No!

3798
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,800
You were gonna steal it from me.

3799
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:57,760
It's either mine or yours.

3800
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:57,920
It's either mine or yours.

3801
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:57,960
It's either mine or yours.

3802
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,560
Come on.

3803
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,420
I got a ball.

3804
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:01,000
I have four balls.

3805
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:01,780
I have four balls.

3806
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:02,560
Anybody need some balls?

3807
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:03,400
I got a ball!

3808
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,060
Okay.

3809
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,140
Oh my god.

3810
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:06,620
Please.

3811
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:08,660
Oh, please.

3812
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:09,460
Oh, god.

3813
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:10,560
Oh, I have one.

3814
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:12,580
Oh, we're so bad.

3815
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:14,600
I swear to fuck this is not consistent.

3816
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:15,980
How many do I need?

3817
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,420
Oh my god.

3818
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,020
Oh my god.

3819
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:20,400
I got one.

3820
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:20,840
I got one.

3821
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,300
One more.

3822
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:23,860
Last two.

3823
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:24,320
Last two.

3824
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:24,780
Come on.

3825
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:26,420
Uh-oh.

3826
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:27,200
Oh, no.

3827
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:27,460
Guys.

3828
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:27,940
Guys.

3829
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:28,280
Guys.

3830
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:28,460
Guys.

3831
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:28,760
Guys.

3832
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:29,260
We lose.

3833
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:29,920
Guys.

3834
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:30,880
It's literally two.

3835
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:31,740
Literally two.

3836
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:32,060
Guys.

3837
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:32,880
Literally two.

3838
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:33,260
It's so hard.

3839
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,140
Are you serious?

3840
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:37,020
No!

3841
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:40,080
Oh my god.

3842
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:40,600
No!

3843
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:42,500
No!

3844
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,320
I think we all moved the slide and we left the game or game.

3845
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,120
I just shoved six balls into my mouth.

3846
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,060
I have the mouth of a squirrel.

3847
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,640
What the hell did you just say?

3848
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,920
This has been my area this whole time.

3849
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:51,880
You guys get out.

3850
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:53,020
I've been...

3851
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:54,420
I've been managing.

3852
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:55,320
No!

3853
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:55,880
No!

3854
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:56,660
Where's the bead?

3855
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,320
No!

3856
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:57,820
No!

3857
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:57,940
No!

3858
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:58,440
Where's the bead?

3859
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:00,000
Oh my god.

3860
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:00,540
Oh my god.

3861
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:00,560
Guys.

3862
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:02,580
Guys, we're a team, guys.

3863
01:57:02,860 --> 01:57:03,660
Let me have some balls.

3864
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:04,760
This is for the girl you need done.

3865
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:07,180
This is for an unbelievably even...

3866
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:07,940
I'm just going to crack it out.

3867
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
...some wide br виде.

3868
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:09,460
Shoot them.

3869
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:10,540
Guys, there's so...

3870
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:10,760
Shoot them.

3871
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:12,680
Why are you rocking all the fucking balls?

3872
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:17,780
Please, guys!

3873
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:20,440

01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,500
Please, guys.

3875
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,480
Oh my god.

3876
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,320
Please, guys.

3877
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:23,640

Please, guys.

3881
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:27,940
Let me have some balls.

3882
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:38,080
You have to make it if you get all the balls!

3883
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,240
You have to be able to make it!

3884
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:44,380
You can't have all the balls for yourself, that's all it takes!

3885
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:52,600
I was like, I'm tired, I'm trying, I wanna fuck around too.

3886
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:57,380
Get away from me, get away from me, get away from me, get away from me!

Oh my god, last three!

Oh no!

3902
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:33,760
Oh no!

3903
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:34,920
Oh no!

3904
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:35,720
Ah!

3905
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,160
One of my hits!

3906
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:37,560
One of my hits, okay!

3907
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:39,880
I think my ball is lined up!

3908
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:40,580
I had it lined up!

3909
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:41,940
No!

3910
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:42,540
Oh shoot!

3911
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:43,680
One of us!

3912
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:44,440
No!

3913
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:45,140
No!

3914
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:45,540
No!

3915
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:50,910
No!

3916
01:58:53,070 --> 01:58:56,930
Why did you drag your body through this door like a wild animal?

3917
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:59,110
Why!

3918
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:01,170
Why were you at the corner!

3919
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,920
Why were you just there!

3920
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:14,020
I was in my own world!

3921
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:16,180
That area was done!

3922
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:17,140
That's insane!

3923
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:23,060
It was the first one to be finished too!

3924
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:25,300
Oh!

3925
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:25,740
I was...

3926
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:26,680
I...

3927
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:29,780
I wasn't all here, I swear!

3928
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:31,220
Oh, I can tell!

3929
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,100
You know what, I'm gonna stay right by the door!

3930
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:40,960
No, no, that was the issue!

3931
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:42,600
We got it, we got it, we got it!

3932
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,600
Go, go, go!

3933
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,080
That looks like a bomb!

3934
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:46,820
Get in!

3935
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:49,800
Grab me by the fucking throat!

3936
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:50,860
Get in!

3937
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,280
That looks like a bomb!

3938
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:57,320
Hi guys, I'm here, I'm here.

3939
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:58,360
No, I'm not here.

3940
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,520
Hey, what's up?

3941
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:02,420
Back, back at it again!

3942
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:03,980
We gotta collect this time, there's more apples!

3943
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:05,400
Don't, don't, don't!

3944
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,360
Don't shoot the bomb!

3945
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:09,100
Please!

3946
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,300
Someone grab this?

3947
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:12,780
Don't shoot the bomb!

3948
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:15,500
What the hell is going on, bro?

3949
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:17,820
Guys, I want an apple too!

3950
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,540
No, no, no bomb, no bomb, no bomb!

3951
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:21,360
Bomb trick!

3952
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,240
Oh nice, okay, I got one.

3953
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:25,100
La bomb.

3954
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:27,040
I can't tell if it's a bomb anymore.

3955
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:28,340
I'm scared of the bomb.

3956
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:30,460
You can't tell what is red and what is black!

3957
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:31,900
Sometimes they change!

3958
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:34,580
They are changing.

3959
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:38,260
Oh shoot.

3960
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:39,500
Oh!

3961
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:40,480
Oh!

3962
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,460
It's fine, 8 more, 8 more in 12 seconds!

3963
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:44,200
We can do this!

3964
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,880
Stop shooting the ones that are far away!

3965
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:48,340
I'm dorky!

3966
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,580
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it, guys.

3967
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:52,820
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it!

3968
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:58,620
Come on, shoot her!

3969
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,220
Come on, shoot her!

3970
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:01,240
We got this, we got this!

3971
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:03,440
We got this, we got this!

3972
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,320
Wait, how do you control?

3973
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:05,700
How do you shoot?

3974
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:06,380
How do you shoot?

3975
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,620
You have a cool down though, you have a cool down.

3976
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:10,480
Oh, okay, okay.

3977
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:13,800
I got this area covered.

3978
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:14,760
Oh Jesus!

3979
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,240
Don't shoot the bomb!

3980
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,920
I think the bomb makes it so that all our apples disappear!

3981
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:22,380
I don't know though, I'm just making things up.

3982
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:26,180
You shoot the bomb, you have 5 minutes left to live.

3983
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:28,820
Send this forward to 10 other people.

3984
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:29,160
Oh no, we got a bomb.

3985
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:31,200
Alright, nice.

3986
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,300
Dude, unlock the fucking...

3987
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:35,940
We're so locked in.

3988
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:36,900
Give me these things.

3989
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:37,340
Apple.

3990
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:40,660
Oh no.

3991
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:46,120
My brain's turned into such fucking mush that all I can do is...

3992
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,300
Okay, we have 10 seconds, we have 10 seconds.

3993
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,040
Apple.

3994
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:48,200
Apple.

3995
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:50,540
Okay, go, go, go.

3996
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:52,320
No!

3997
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,000
I couldn't!

3998
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,800
People were blocking my way!

3999
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:01,280
That sucks!

4000
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:03,640
Oh...

4001
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:07,260
It's okay, we did it.

4002
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:07,660
We got in.

4003
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,480
Oh no!

4004
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:11,180
Oh no!

4005
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,880
Oh my god, there's bombs!

4006
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:16,440
Noooo!

4007
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:18,220
I hate this one!

4008
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,680
We live here now.

4009
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:22,320
This is where we live now.

4010
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,880
This is okay, we're getting better, we're getting better at copying.

4011
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:26,360
Are we?

4012
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:27,280
Are we?

4013
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,780
We haven't got a single one, but we're getting better, guys.

4014
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:31,360
I got one!

4015
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:33,760
Oh, thanks for doing it.

4016
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,340
I got one!

4017
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:37,300
I like your corner over here, it's nice.

4018
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:40,080
Us two, us two here.

4019
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:42,880
Hey, hey.

4020
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:43,680
Hey now.

4021
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:45,660
Hey now.

4022
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,220
Let's play nice.

4023
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:49,320
Let's play nice live.

4024
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,080
Let's play nice.

4025
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,280
Last one, last one!

4026
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,360
Sorry, I can't shoot.

4027
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,600
We're leading one!

4028
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:59,020
I got this, I believe!

4029
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,760
I got it, I got it, I got it!

4030
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:01,340
No, shvuck!

4031
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:02,940
No!

4032
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,460
We're leading one!

4033
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:09,240
Oh, guys.

4034
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:10,620
Oh dear.

4035
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,980
I got it, I got it, I got it.

4036
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:12,520
Wait, what?

4037
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,620
I guess.

4038
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:16,200
Go, go, go, go, go!

4039
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:21,290
Run!

4040
02:03:24,030 --> 02:03:24,750
Oh, my.

4041
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:29,150
I love when we win and nobody's expecting it.

4042
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:30,730
So we just start shaking each other up.

4043
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:31,630
Yeah.

4044
02:03:36,090 --> 02:03:38,850
Swapping in person to person so fucking easily.

4045
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:39,530
It's awful.

4046
02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:41,590
It really does.

4047
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:43,090
It's exactly like a crowd panic.

4048
02:03:43,150 --> 02:03:44,150
It's so horrifying.

4049
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:47,850
We're like, please!

4050
02:03:48,150 --> 02:03:49,950
Stay calm, everybody!

4051
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:51,510
And everybody just runs around.

4052
02:03:51,730 --> 02:03:52,630
Please, women and elderly first!

4053
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:55,510
And I push the elderly down.

4054
02:03:59,070 --> 02:03:59,550
Oh, shoot.

4055
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:01,550
Oh, no, no, no!

4056
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:02,590
I messed up.

4057
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:03,070
Oh, no.

4058
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:08,130
It looks like if you actually hit it on the downswing, there's like no power whatsoever.

4059
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:09,630
So you have to go back up again.

4060
02:04:10,350 --> 02:04:11,110
They're different.

4061
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:13,970
I genuinely haven't gotten like a single ball.

4062
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:15,570
I don't know where I am.

4063
02:04:16,350 --> 02:04:18,550
I'm just gonna see if I make it.

4064
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:21,210
Oh, you're good.

4065
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:22,110
You don't die, though.

4066
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:22,710
You don't die.

4067
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:23,330
Yeah, you don't die.

4068
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:25,070
You just get immobilized.

4069
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:27,230
I believe in you, Amelie.

4070
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:29,090
I swear these are different.

4071
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:29,690
I believe in you.

4072
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:31,170
I swear these are different.

4073
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:33,370
I'm gonna watch until you get it in.

4074
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:33,970
I fucked up.

4075
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:37,850
Oh, guys.

4076
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:39,070
Guys.

4077
02:04:41,370 --> 02:04:43,370
Guys, it's right behind us.

4078
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:44,010
Go, go, go!

4079
02:04:45,730 --> 02:04:48,090
We literally need like one or two more seconds.

4080
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:50,690
We literally need like one or two more seconds.

4081
02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:51,890
We got it this time, for sure.

4082
02:04:52,130 --> 02:04:52,530
We got it this time, for sure.

4083
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:53,150
We figured it out.

4084
02:04:53,630 --> 02:04:57,230
Wait, there's numbers on the top of the basket?

4085
02:04:57,670 --> 02:04:57,710
Wait, there's numbers on the top of the basket?

4086
02:04:58,070 --> 02:05:00,470
Are you actually serious?

4087
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:01,350
No, there's no way.

4088
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:02,710
Are you lying?

4089
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:04,470
There's no way.

4090
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:08,570
Amelie, this is your second time playing.

4091
02:05:09,070 --> 02:05:10,510
Amelie, you cannot be serious.

4092
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:12,990
You cannot be serious, Amelie.

4093
02:05:17,230 --> 02:05:18,630
Amelie, do you wear glasses?

4094
02:05:19,130 --> 02:05:20,250
Amelie, do you wear glasses?

4095
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:21,150
You're watching me.

4096
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:22,590
I'm actually gonna cry.

4097
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:26,570
You're watching me.

4098
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:26,790
You're watching me.

4099
02:05:26,830 --> 02:05:27,870
There's no way.

4100
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:28,890
I can't.

4101
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:29,490
There's no way.

4102
02:05:30,970 --> 02:05:32,210
She's lying, chat.

4103
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,750
Guys, guys, she's lying.

4104
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:35,490
She's just making content, guys.

4105
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:36,130
There's no way.

4106
02:05:36,410 --> 02:05:37,930
She's farming clips right now.

4107
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:38,610
She's just farming.

4108
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:42,750
She's farming clips for her TikTok, guys.

4109
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:43,530
There's no way.

4110
02:05:47,690 --> 02:05:48,970
Just one more.

4111
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:49,710
Just one more.

4112
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:50,370
Just one more.

4113
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:53,050
One of us will get it in.

4114
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:55,750
Come on, guys.

4115
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:56,650
Gamers.

4116
02:05:57,530 --> 02:06:00,090
Guys, we need Lillian.

4117
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:00,810
Guys.

4118
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:02,230
I can't get this.

4119
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:05,130
What is happening?

4120
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:06,490
Yeah.

4121
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:07,210
Yeah.

4122
02:06:08,010 --> 02:06:09,730
We are so bad at this.

4123
02:06:09,790 --> 02:06:10,810
Just stay quiet.

4124
02:06:12,010 --> 02:06:13,490
Did nobody go to Chuck E.

4125
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:14,050
Cheese as a kid?

4126
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:14,590
Come on.

4127
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:15,270
It's showing.

4128
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:16,030
Chuck E.

4129
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:17,350
Cheese doesn't exist here.

4130
02:06:17,890 --> 02:06:18,290
Okay.

4131
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:19,930
I wasn't here.

4132
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:21,750
My bad.

4133
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:25,490
Yeah, but now you can go to Chuck E.

4134
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:26,450
Cheese now, Amelie.

4135
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:27,670
You can go there now.

4136
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:29,970
Oh, my God.

4137
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,170
That'd be such a funny video.

4138
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:31,890
Val, can I help you?

4139
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:32,330
Val?

4140
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:32,830
No, sorry.

4141
02:06:35,410 --> 02:06:37,150
We got the right side done.

4142
02:06:38,370 --> 02:06:38,730
Sorry.

4143
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:41,210
I think I'm getting better at this.

4144
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:42,570
Yeah.

4145
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:42,950
Yeah.

4146
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:44,270
I really got the feel for it now.

4147
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:44,490
Okay.

4148
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:46,310
I missed two after I said that.

4149
02:06:46,450 --> 02:06:46,850
I got it.

4150
02:06:46,850 --> 02:06:47,410
I wanted to stay.

4151
02:06:47,410 --> 02:06:48,790
I'd like to stay the same.

4152
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:51,850
I do okay right up until there's lots of people here.

4153
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:54,950
And I can't get my perfect angle that I just do over and over again.

4154
02:06:55,070 --> 02:06:55,090
Oh, yeah.

4155
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:55,990
That perfect.

4156
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:58,070
Because everybody's watching and there's so much pressure.

4157
02:06:58,250 --> 02:06:58,690
Oh, shit.

4158
02:06:58,910 --> 02:06:59,150
Oh, no.

4159
02:06:59,210 --> 02:07:00,230
It's just you're in the fucking way.

4160
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,010
God damn it.

4161
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:06,230
Whoa.

4162
02:07:06,230 --> 02:07:07,170
That was off the rim.

4163
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:07,970
That should have been in.

4164
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:08,390
All right.

4165
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:09,230
I did my job.

4166
02:07:09,310 --> 02:07:09,930
I'm just going to wait here.

4167
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:12,350
Because I don't think we're going to make it, guys.

4168
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:13,690
Yes, we are.

4169
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:14,690
Oh, no, we're not.

4170
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:16,330
Oh, wait.

4171
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:16,710
Wait.

4172
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:17,070
Wait.

4173
02:07:17,170 --> 02:07:18,790
It could be a miracle.

4174
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:20,310
What's that dog on the...

4175
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:21,950
The dog on the basketball.

4176
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:22,950
Air Bud.

4177
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:26,330
Guys, I don't think we're him.

4178
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:28,150
The dog on the basketball.

4179
02:07:28,150 --> 02:07:30,610
The dog on the basketball.

4180
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:31,770
The dog on the basketball.

4181
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:33,590
Don't stand on my head.

4182
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:34,610
I need to shoot out.

4183
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:38,090
A miracle will happen.

4184
02:07:38,130 --> 02:07:39,170
The dog will come.

4185
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:40,350
The dog will come.

4186
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:40,610
The dog will come.

4187
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:43,290
The air Bud will show up.

4188
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:45,730
The fucking basketball messiah, Air Bud.

4189
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:46,430
The fucking basketball messiah, Air Bud.

4190
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:48,170
Air Bud just falls from the sky.

4191
02:07:50,110 --> 02:07:51,290
He's the secret.

4192
02:07:52,670 --> 02:07:53,470
Oh, shit.

4193
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:56,850
If you say Air Bud three times in the mirror, he'll show up.

4194
02:07:57,010 --> 02:07:57,030
If you say Air Bud three times in the mirror, he'll show up.

4195
02:07:58,150 --> 02:08:03,470
Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud, Air Bud.

4196
02:08:04,290 --> 02:08:04,650
Oh, my God.

4197
02:08:04,650 --> 02:08:05,210
I feel him.

4198
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:07,030
His spirit is inside of me.

4199
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:12,190
Okay.

4200
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:14,470
Okay.

4201
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:15,010
Okay.

4202
02:08:16,150 --> 02:08:18,130
He didn't understand how this game worked.

4203
02:08:18,350 --> 02:08:18,710
Okay.

4204
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:19,010
Okay.

4205
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:19,830
Okay, Middle.

4206
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:20,190
Middle.

4207
02:08:20,190 --> 02:08:20,410
Middle.

4208
02:08:20,450 --> 02:08:20,570
The last three.

4209
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:20,570
The last one.

4210
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:20,990
The last one.

4211
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:22,670
He just kicked my ball out of my hand.

4212
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:22,950
Yes.

4213
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:23,630
LElere goes one more.

4214
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:24,490
Two more.

4215
02:08:24,650 --> 02:08:24,970
Two more.

4216
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:25,930
Me too.

4217
02:08:27,110 --> 02:08:29,350
Oh, come on, we're so close!

4218
02:08:29,430 --> 02:08:29,890
Be with me!

4219
02:08:32,290 --> 02:08:32,810
Airpods!

4220
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:34,730
Get in, get in, get in!

4221
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:38,710
Oh, I redeemed myself with that one, let me tell you.

4222
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:42,850
Oh, my Airpods, let's go Airpods!

4223
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:44,110
Show me Airpods!

4224
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:49,830
See, it happened as soon as you started saying Airpods.

4225
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:54,410
Top down view, what the fuck is this?

4226
02:08:56,530 --> 02:08:58,390
Oh, we have to be in the light?

4227
02:08:58,390 --> 02:08:59,350
Oh, it's Metal Gear!

4228
02:09:00,150 --> 02:09:01,810
Oh, we each have to...

4229
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:04,870
Oh, we can't go through the holes!

4230
02:09:04,990 --> 02:09:05,670
The holes.

4231
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:08,570
Don't touch the black thing.

4232
02:09:08,850 --> 02:09:11,310
Yeah, I think we each have to step on a button.

4233
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:13,790
I got this side.

4234
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:16,550
It's clearly the pit!

4235
02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:17,790
That's a pit.

4236
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:20,090
It's clearly a pit?

4237
02:09:20,210 --> 02:09:21,510
Why would that be clearly a pit?

4238
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:22,870
Just don't fall, dummy!

4239
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:23,670
What do you mean?

4240
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:25,090
I'm getting smaller!

4241
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:30,090
Well, it wasn't only after I died, I realized that.

4242
02:09:31,390 --> 02:09:32,930
Everybody grab a button.

4243
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:35,170
Everybody grab a button.

4244
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:36,530
Grab a button.

4245
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:37,390
Nice!

4246
02:09:37,570 --> 02:09:38,570
Guys, I'm falling!

4247
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:38,910
I'm falling!

4248
02:09:38,910 --> 02:09:39,550
Stop falling!

4249
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:40,350
Stop falling!

4250
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:42,530
You have two legs!

4251
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:43,210
I'm sorry!

4252
02:09:43,410 --> 02:09:44,730
I wear a size 12.

4253
02:09:44,930 --> 02:09:46,210
My shoes are so big.

4254
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:46,650
Yeah!

4255
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:48,010
I absolutely...

4256
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:49,270
She wears a clown suit.

4257
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:50,910
Just look at your little shadow on your feet!

4258
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:53,370
My Kingdom Hearts shoes had my...

4259
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:54,490
My weakness.

4260
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:56,190
Okay.

4261
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:57,150
Okay.

4262
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:57,930
Okay.

4263
02:09:58,070 --> 02:09:59,770
Careful with your shoes, Nuffy!

4264
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:00,270
Careful!

4265
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:01,690
I'm going very slow!

4266
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:04,690
Watch out for me.

4267
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:04,850
Yeah.

4268
02:10:06,030 --> 02:10:06,990
And then one more here.

4269
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:08,350
Oh!

4270
02:10:08,990 --> 02:10:10,170
We have to bait the...

4271
02:10:10,170 --> 02:10:11,150
Okay, I guess we fucked.

4272
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:12,130
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4273
02:10:12,230 --> 02:10:13,030
And then we bait the bat.

4274
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:13,710
Bait the bat.

4275
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:16,070
Okay, so everybody but one person get on their buttons.

4276
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:17,930
And then one person has to do the timing.

4277
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:18,170
How do I bait it?

4278
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:19,390
Oh God, I'm scared.

4279
02:10:19,450 --> 02:10:20,430
Okay, I'll get off the button.

4280
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:20,890
I'll get it off.

4281
02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:21,130
Okay.

4282
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:21,650
Okay, I...

4283
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:22,330
You do it.

4284
02:10:22,330 --> 02:10:23,190
Oh, my button!

4285
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:24,090
Oh, my button!

4286
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:27,370
You have to bait it towards...

4287
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:29,270
Why did you go down?

4288
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:34,870
It's like it's a 50-50 and you jump down.

4289
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,130
It's just a damn bat.

4290
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:41,910
Okay, okay.

4291
02:10:42,150 --> 02:10:42,710
Oh.

4292
02:10:45,670 --> 02:10:47,830
Somebody else is wearing the clown shoes.

4293
02:10:48,050 --> 02:10:50,110
Valerie 3 was so loud, I'm scared for heaven.

4294
02:10:50,330 --> 02:10:50,570
Oh, my God.

4295
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:51,110
Oh, my God.

4296
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:52,310
Oh, yeah, okay.

4297
02:10:53,210 --> 02:10:54,410
We got this guys.

4298
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:55,690
I believe in us.

4299
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:57,850
I'm gonna be normal now.

4300
02:10:57,850 --> 02:10:58,030
All right.

4301
02:10:58,170 --> 02:10:59,890
Oh, Steffi, I saw that.

4302
02:11:00,370 --> 02:11:01,050
No, no, no.

4303
02:11:01,050 --> 02:11:01,770
Don't look at me.

4304
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:02,150
No.

4305
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:03,210
That was clean.

4306
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:04,630
Go ahead.

4307
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:04,890
Go ahead.

4308
02:11:04,890 --> 02:11:06,470
I will bait the bat.

4309
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:08,110
Oh, you will do it?

4310
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:08,390
Okay.

4311
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:08,650
Okay.

4312
02:11:08,650 --> 02:11:09,610
You do hit the button.

4313
02:11:10,110 --> 02:11:11,030
I believe in you.

4314
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:11,330
All right.

4315
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:12,150
Ready, ready, ready.

4316
02:11:12,190 --> 02:11:13,090
Okay, we're ready.

4317
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:13,850
I'm gonna fuck up.

4318
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:14,230
Maybe.

4319
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:14,770
I'm gonna fuck up.

4320
02:11:15,290 --> 02:11:15,850
Oh, drop it.

4321
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:16,170
Oh.

4322
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:17,490
She fucked up.

4323
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:19,130
There's a delay.

4324
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:19,550
Yeah.

4325
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:21,330
That was good though.

4326
02:11:21,550 --> 02:11:21,950
Good timing.

4327
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:23,830
Yeah, but we figured out the timing.

4328
02:11:23,850 --> 02:11:24,570
We figured it out.

4329
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:25,270
Just get a right score who steps into the.

4330
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:26,150
Oh, clown shoes.

4331
02:11:28,770 --> 02:11:31,230
The word this time will be different, guys.

4332
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:31,850
Right there.

4333
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:37,950
So, you have to wait for it to move a little bit, but not too much because there is a fucking delay on it.

4334
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:40,730
Nice.

4335
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:42,110
I believe in us.

4336
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:43,270
I believe in us, Kriu.

4337
02:11:43,490 --> 02:11:43,530
Oh, Jesus Christ.

4338
02:11:43,530 --> 02:11:43,970
I'm so sorry, Steffi.

4339
02:11:44,530 --> 02:11:45,090
It's okay.

4340
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:46,450
I've mastered it.

4341
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:48,530
No.

4342
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:49,110
This is not fun.

4343
02:11:49,770 --> 02:11:50,410
Alright.

4344
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:52,410
Alright.

4345
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:53,110
Okay.

4346
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:55,610
Take it easy now.

4347
02:11:55,610 --> 02:11:57,070
You guys got it.

4348
02:11:57,590 --> 02:12:00,810
I'll do it.

4349
02:12:00,910 --> 02:12:02,190
I trust you.

4350
02:12:03,090 --> 02:12:04,550
That's ill-advised.

4351
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:05,930
I trust you.

4352
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,770
She has the most experience.

4353
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:08,370
Yeah, exactly.

4354
02:12:09,710 --> 02:12:11,710
You almost ran off.

4355
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:12,690
That was crazy.

4356
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:15,350
It looks like the Nightbot.

4357
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:16,670
Let Juniper go first.

4358
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:17,990
Wait, wait, wait.

4359
02:12:18,110 --> 02:12:19,070
Grab the key from her.

4360
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,590
Alright.

4361
02:12:26,450 --> 02:12:27,550
No, no.

4362
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:29,450
You guys go.

4363
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:29,930
You go.

4364
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:36,650
The whole point was the key should not be in Amelie's head.

4365
02:12:37,810 --> 02:12:40,050
It's like fighting at its last moment.

4366
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:44,610
Okay, you go.

4367
02:12:46,670 --> 02:12:46,950
Go, go, go.

4368
02:12:49,870 --> 02:12:51,490
We figured it out.

4369
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:53,270
We figured it out, guys.

4370
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:54,730
Oh, my God.

4371
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:55,850
That was so scary.

4372
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,470
How do I go in?

4373
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:01,670
You put the keys in my hand.

4374
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:03,590
No, Amelie can't go in.

4375
02:13:08,090 --> 02:13:08,610
Alright.

4376
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:10,410
Another top-down view.

4377
02:13:11,690 --> 02:13:12,430
Oh, God.

4378
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:15,090
Guys, we figured it out.

4379
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:15,910
Oh, what?

4380
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:16,830
Oh, no.

4381
02:13:18,070 --> 02:13:19,090
We have to catch them.

4382
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:21,150
How?

4383
02:13:21,490 --> 02:13:22,870
We need to sort it out.

4384
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:23,270
There we go.

4385
02:13:23,310 --> 02:13:23,590
Like that.

4386
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:26,870
Oh, it's dying.

4387
02:13:26,990 --> 02:13:27,530
It's dying.

4388
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:28,630
Kill it.

4389
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:29,050
Kill it.

4390
02:13:31,450 --> 02:13:33,050
We don't want him to breathe.

4391
02:13:34,330 --> 02:13:35,470
Oh, this is time, guys.

4392
02:13:35,530 --> 02:13:35,950
This is time.

4393
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:36,890
We gotta catch more.

4394
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:38,030
Catch more.

4395
02:13:38,230 --> 02:13:38,710
Kill him.

4396
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:41,670
Don't let him breathe.

4397
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:44,110
We don't have air holes in here.

4398
02:13:44,110 --> 02:13:45,850
Just remember, we have no air holes.

4399
02:13:46,030 --> 02:13:48,190
Oh, I see.

4400
02:13:48,490 --> 02:13:51,890
Just being near us, it's like we're emitting a stink.

4401
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:54,550
Just being near us, it's like we're emitting a stink.

4402
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:55,130
There must be...

4403
02:13:56,590 --> 02:13:57,970
Guys, we're on stream.

4404
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:58,650
We're on stream.

4405
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:01,050
Oh, no.

4406
02:14:01,330 --> 02:14:02,910
I don't think we're gonna make it.

4407
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:04,610
We're gonna die.

4408
02:14:07,070 --> 02:14:11,110
That was so close.

4409
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:13,890
Never cross the stream.

4410
02:14:15,230 --> 02:14:15,570
Okay.

4411
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:16,530
I am...

4412
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:17,830
We have to go down.

4413
02:14:19,330 --> 02:14:20,590
Come snuggle with me, Snuffy.

4414
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,070
We'll be great.

4415
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:22,750
Get that one right there.

4416
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:23,470
Get two.

4417
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,770
Get two.

4418
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:24,390
Double kill.

4419
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:27,210
Oh, my God.

4420
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:27,770
Triple kill.

4421
02:14:28,410 --> 02:14:28,750
Nice.

4422
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:32,510
Oh, there's the door.

4423
02:14:32,590 --> 02:14:33,090
There's the door.

4424
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:34,790
Good to know.

4425
02:14:35,090 --> 02:14:37,430
We were so fucking doomed last time because we had no idea what the door was.

4426
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,490
Two more.

4427
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:37,790
Two more.

4428
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:38,170
Yeah.

4429
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:41,430
We're at the bottom.

4430
02:14:42,010 --> 02:14:44,030
Do we have to navigate over there?

4431
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:45,710
It's our big rope creation, too.

4432
02:14:45,930 --> 02:14:48,270
No, I think we just need to kill the butterflies and then...

4433
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:49,690
It's a free-for-all.

4434
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:49,930
Yeah.

4435
02:14:50,110 --> 02:14:51,870
And then we go straight top right.

4436
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:52,630
Alright.

4437
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:53,590
Nice.

4438
02:14:53,590 --> 02:14:53,770
Nice.

4439
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:53,910
Nice.

4440
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:54,870
Grab.

4441
02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:55,210
Grab.

4442
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:55,430
Grab.

4443
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:55,790
Go.

4444
02:14:55,950 --> 02:14:56,110
Go.

4445
02:14:56,110 --> 02:14:56,290
Go.

4446
02:14:57,930 --> 02:14:58,730
Oh, no.

4447
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,430
Go.

4448
02:14:59,530 --> 02:14:59,610
Go.

4449
02:14:59,610 --> 02:14:59,790
Go.

4450
02:14:59,790 --> 02:14:59,990
Go.

4451
02:14:59,990 --> 02:15:00,270
Go.

4452
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:01,570
Go.

4453
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:02,710
Go.

4454
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:02,990
Yeah.

4455
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:06,470
That was so easy.

4456
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:09,190
We're such a good team.

4457
02:15:09,590 --> 02:15:09,990
Yeah.

4458
02:15:11,110 --> 02:15:11,410
That was faster.

4459
02:15:12,910 --> 02:15:13,430
Almost.

4460
02:15:13,890 --> 02:15:15,310
But we still made it.

4461
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:16,790
Oh, okay.

4462
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:19,950
Who can hide?

4463
02:15:20,050 --> 02:15:21,310
Wait, what does it mean to hide?

4464
02:15:21,370 --> 02:15:21,670
Who's hiding?

4465
02:15:21,710 --> 02:15:22,370
Who can hide?

4466
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:23,830
Who's hiding right now?

4467
02:15:23,970 --> 02:15:24,650
Can anybody?

4468
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:26,150
Can anybody hide?

4469
02:15:26,590 --> 02:15:27,430
Oh, you can.

4470
02:15:27,790 --> 02:15:28,310
Oh.

4471
02:15:31,790 --> 02:15:33,070
I made them.

4472
02:15:34,090 --> 02:15:34,870
Oh, wait.

4473
02:15:39,070 --> 02:15:40,250
Metal Gear Man.

4474
02:15:41,150 --> 02:15:42,490
That's a Metal Gear reference.

4475
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:43,970
Yeah, that's a Metal Gear reference.

4476
02:15:44,330 --> 02:15:44,950
Oh, it's me.

4477
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:45,510
It's me.

4478
02:15:45,530 --> 02:15:45,730
It's me.

4479
02:15:45,770 --> 02:15:46,030
It's me.

4480
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:46,670
Get out.

4481
02:15:46,810 --> 02:15:47,250
Get out.

4482
02:15:49,030 --> 02:15:50,270
I wanna be the one.

4483
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:50,650
Okay.

4484
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:50,970
Okay.

4485
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:55,250
I'm gonna keep dying until I get the box.

4486
02:15:57,790 --> 02:15:58,270
It's me.

4487
02:15:58,370 --> 02:15:58,750
It's me.

4488
02:16:00,410 --> 02:16:00,950
It's me.

4489
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:01,050
It's me.

4490
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:01,530
It's me.

4491
02:16:01,930 --> 02:16:02,850
It's me.

4492
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:04,130
It's me.

4493
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:04,470
It's me.

4494
02:16:04,690 --> 02:16:04,790
It's me.

4495
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:04,890
Okay.

4496
02:16:05,070 --> 02:16:05,570
Let's go.

4497
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:09,210
It won't let you use the box if they...

4498
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:09,790
I think once you're caught.

4499
02:16:09,930 --> 02:16:10,190
Yeah.

4500
02:16:12,070 --> 02:16:12,510
Okay.

4501
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:12,870
Okay.

4502
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:13,090
Okay.

4503
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:14,770
Who has it?

4504
02:16:14,850 --> 02:16:15,210
Who has it?

4505
02:16:15,690 --> 02:16:16,390
Oh, it's me.

4506
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:16,790
It's me.

4507
02:16:16,870 --> 02:16:19,670
I think it's whoever's in the far top.

4508
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:20,330
Oh.

4509
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:21,290
Oh.

4510
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:21,950
Ooh.

4511
02:16:22,190 --> 02:16:22,470
Goodbye.

4512
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:22,930
Goodbye.

4513
02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:26,450
I think if you ran to the box, you'll be safe.

4514
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:27,170
Yeah.

4515
02:16:27,190 --> 02:16:27,570
Yeah.

4516
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:27,570
Yeah.

4517
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:27,690
Yeah.

4518
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:29,390
Okay.

4519
02:16:29,710 --> 02:16:30,070
Who has it?

4520
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:30,410
Who has it?

4521
02:16:30,630 --> 02:16:30,710
It's me.

4522
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:31,490
All right.

4523
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:34,230
We gotta let Mint go first.

4524
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:34,470
Go.

4525
02:16:35,890 --> 02:16:36,330
Nice.

4526
02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:37,390
We're so safe.

4527
02:16:37,430 --> 02:16:37,590
Okay.

4528
02:16:37,630 --> 02:16:37,750
Go.

4529
02:16:39,170 --> 02:16:39,610
Nice.

4530
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:41,510
Oh my god.

4531
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:42,770
Those ones are so suspicious.

4532
02:16:43,650 --> 02:16:45,110
They tricked you.

4533
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:46,890
They went out of sync.

4534
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:48,110
They went out of sync.

4535
02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:50,890
Those on the right were so suspicious.

4536
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:52,290
They were like, that was weird.

4537
02:16:52,590 --> 02:16:53,290
All right, Emily.

4538
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:55,770
Let her go first.

4539
02:16:57,790 --> 02:16:58,650
You got this.

4540
02:17:00,190 --> 02:17:00,910
All right.

4541
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:01,390
Nice.

4542
02:17:01,970 --> 02:17:03,030
They're out of sync now.

4543
02:17:04,470 --> 02:17:05,650
They get suspicious.

4544
02:17:05,970 --> 02:17:08,570
They like, kind of be like, oh, I see that box.

4545
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:09,510
Yeah.

4546
02:17:09,510 --> 02:17:09,870
Yeah.

4547
02:17:10,470 --> 02:17:10,830
Yeah.

4548
02:17:11,410 --> 02:17:11,510
Yeah.

4549
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:13,670
Who has it?

4550
02:17:13,810 --> 02:17:14,050
It's me.

4551
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:15,390
We have to learn the stealth.

4552
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:15,630
Okay.

4553
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:15,850
Okay.

4554
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:15,910
Wait.

4555
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:16,110
Wait.

4556
02:17:16,110 --> 02:17:16,210
Wait.

4557
02:17:16,210 --> 02:17:16,870
Next time.

4558
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:17,190
Next time.

4559
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:18,630
Go.

4560
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:18,790
Go.

4561
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:19,030
Go.

4562
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:19,250
Go.

4563
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:19,410
Go.

4564
02:17:19,410 --> 02:17:19,510
Go.

4565
02:17:21,050 --> 02:17:21,770
Get inside.

4566
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:22,770
Sorry.

4567
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:23,310
Sorry.

4568
02:17:23,390 --> 02:17:24,010
I thought I was in.

4569
02:17:24,030 --> 02:17:25,970
He stood in front of the box.

4570
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:29,090
Oh, I have it.

4571
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:29,570
I have it.

4572
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:29,930
I have it.

4573
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:30,370
All right, guys.

4574
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:32,670
I'm known for my stealth.

4575
02:17:33,430 --> 02:17:34,030
We know.

4576
02:17:36,170 --> 02:17:36,950
Oh, okay.

4577
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:37,390
Okay.

4578
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:38,050
We're still here.

4579
02:17:38,270 --> 02:17:40,350
They do go back into sync.

4580
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:41,450
Nice.

4581
02:17:41,930 --> 02:17:42,270
Nice.

4582
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:44,730
Go.

4583
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:44,850
Go.

4584
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:44,990
Go.

4585
02:17:44,990 --> 02:17:45,210
Okay.

4586
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:45,570
Nice.

4587
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:46,910
No problem.

4588
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:47,710
Hold on.

4589
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:48,170
Yeah.

4590
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:50,630
Okay.

4591
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:51,230
I'm going to...

4592
02:17:51,230 --> 02:17:51,350
Wait.

4593
02:17:51,390 --> 02:17:51,510
Wait.

4594
02:17:51,510 --> 02:17:51,710
Wait.

4595
02:17:51,710 --> 02:17:51,850
Wait.

4596
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:53,050
Box.

4597
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:53,790
Box.

4598
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:54,610
Oh, fuck.

4599
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:57,610
What do you mean, box, folks?

4600
02:17:57,730 --> 02:17:58,990
You just ran up there.

4601
02:17:59,090 --> 02:18:00,010
That wasn't me.

4602
02:18:00,450 --> 02:18:01,950
I wouldn't run up there.

4603
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:03,390
Hey, Jennifer.

4604
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:04,410
You know what I mean?

4605
02:18:04,590 --> 02:18:04,870
Me?

4606
02:18:05,090 --> 02:18:05,930
Oh, it is me.

4607
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:06,450
Yeah.

4608
02:18:06,450 --> 02:18:06,450
Okay.

4609
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:06,730
Yippee.

4610
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:08,270
All right, everybody.

4611
02:18:10,330 --> 02:18:10,950
I don't know.

4612
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:11,550
Oh.

4613
02:18:11,550 --> 02:18:16,730
I ain't waiting.

4614
02:18:17,070 --> 02:18:19,590
I ain't waiting.

4615
02:18:20,190 --> 02:18:20,990
You gotta say when.

4616
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:24,570
You gotta say when.

4617
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:25,350
I'm waiting for Stuffy.

4618
02:18:25,850 --> 02:18:27,030
I made it.

4619
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:27,630
Okay.

4620
02:18:28,570 --> 02:18:29,010
Ready?

4621
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:29,430
This one.

4622
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:29,990
Go.

4623
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:31,070
Uh-oh.

4624
02:18:31,130 --> 02:18:31,570
All right.

4625
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:32,970
We just wait until they both turn up.

4626
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:33,310
Okay.

4627
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:34,450
Wait.

4628
02:18:34,710 --> 02:18:35,010
Wait.

4629
02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:35,330
Wait.

4630
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:35,610
Okay.

4631
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:36,330
Okay.

4632
02:18:36,390 --> 02:18:36,590
Okay.

4633
02:18:36,710 --> 02:18:40,330
What happened?

4634
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:41,990
What happened?

4635
02:18:43,070 --> 02:18:43,510
Okay.

4636
02:18:43,650 --> 02:18:43,810
Okay.

4637
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:44,290
What happened?

4638
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:48,970
One day it will be my turn to wield the box.

4639
02:18:48,990 --> 02:18:49,330
Okay.

4640
02:18:49,730 --> 02:18:50,450
I believe.

4641
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:51,610
Oh.

4642
02:18:54,710 --> 02:18:55,150
Oh.

4643
02:19:01,630 --> 02:19:02,510
I'm sorry.

4644
02:19:03,930 --> 02:19:05,410
That was my first box.

4645
02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:06,070
I did not know.

4646
02:19:06,090 --> 02:19:06,590
Who has it?

4647
02:19:06,970 --> 02:19:07,450
It's me.

4648
02:19:08,470 --> 02:19:08,910
No.

4649
02:19:10,970 --> 02:19:11,410
No.

4650
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:13,790
I didn't even get to use it.

4651
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:16,410
Okay.

4652
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:18,030
Okay.

4653
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:19,510
This is my redemption arc.

4654
02:19:19,930 --> 02:19:21,070
I believe in you, Stuffy.

4655
02:19:21,190 --> 02:19:22,610
Get nice and close to the line.

4656
02:19:23,130 --> 02:19:23,570
Okay.

4657
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:23,770
Wait.

4658
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:23,970
Wait.

4659
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:24,190
Wait.

4660
02:19:24,190 --> 02:19:24,370
Wait.

4661
02:19:24,570 --> 02:19:24,570
Wait.

4662
02:19:24,710 --> 02:19:24,970
Wait.

4663
02:19:24,970 --> 02:19:25,750
Wait after this.

4664
02:19:25,810 --> 02:19:26,010
Okay.

4665
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,510
I'm going.

4666
02:19:26,610 --> 02:19:26,810
I'm going.

4667
02:19:30,010 --> 02:19:30,350
Okay.

4668
02:19:37,450 --> 02:19:37,790
Okay.

4669
02:19:39,930 --> 02:19:40,270
Okay.

4670
02:19:42,930 --> 02:19:44,270
Please get up.

4671
02:19:44,590 --> 02:19:45,150
All right.

4672
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:45,610
Let's go.

4673
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:46,670
Uh-oh.

4674
02:19:46,890 --> 02:19:49,090
We are waiting for you.

4675
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:49,850
We are waiting for you.

4676
02:19:49,850 --> 02:19:50,150
Yeah, wait.

4677
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:51,070
Everybody in the boat.

4678
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:52,250
Alright, they're tricking you.

4679
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:55,330
I got stuck in the boat!

4680
02:20:02,310 --> 02:20:03,350
Who has it?

4681
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:05,190
I think it's me again.

4682
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:05,670
Okay.

4683
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:07,790
Alright, everyone gather.

4684
02:20:08,830 --> 02:20:09,550
Okay, we go.

4685
02:20:11,650 --> 02:20:12,430
Oh, we're good?

4686
02:20:12,630 --> 02:20:13,050
Nice.

4687
02:20:13,250 --> 02:20:14,190
Wait for it.

4688
02:20:14,410 --> 02:20:15,890
Wait for the second.

4689
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:17,250
Alright, we go.

4690
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:19,410
Oh, nice.

4691
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:19,950
Nice.

4692
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:23,190
We let them sink, okay?

4693
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:24,290
We go.

4694
02:20:24,330 --> 02:20:25,150
Okay, and then we wait.

4695
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:26,330
Then we wait.

4696
02:20:26,650 --> 02:20:27,550
We're gonna turn around.

4697
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:29,190
When they turn around, I'm gonna go up.

4698
02:20:29,290 --> 02:20:30,250
Wait, can we touch them?

4699
02:20:30,490 --> 02:20:30,890
Or...

4700
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:32,390
I don't think...

4701
02:20:32,390 --> 02:20:32,750
I don't...

4702
02:20:32,750 --> 02:20:32,950
Yeah.

4703
02:20:35,650 --> 02:20:36,570
Follow, follow, follow.

4704
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:40,250
Okay, follow, follow, follow.

4705
02:20:40,470 --> 02:20:40,690
The cake.

4706
02:20:41,950 --> 02:20:42,750
Oh, no!

4707
02:20:43,050 --> 02:20:43,450
No!

4708
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:47,580
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake.

4709
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:49,140
What the fuck?

4710
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:49,860
Oh, no, no, no!

4711
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:50,060
I...

4712
02:20:50,060 --> 02:20:50,560
I...

4713
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:50,700
I...

4714
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:52,160
What is it?

4715
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:55,400
Emily has it.

4716
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:57,020
Oh, how do you know?

4717
02:20:57,220 --> 02:20:57,780
Oh, at the top.

4718
02:20:57,780 --> 02:20:58,540
Because it's the top...

4719
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,940
Top left person has it.

4720
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:01,320
Ready after this one?

4721
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:03,780
Box.

4722
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:04,400
Oh.

4723
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:04,980
Oh...

4724
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:05,900
Box time.

4725
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:10,040
We're so close to the edge.

4726
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:10,920
This is sort of scary.

4727
02:21:11,320 --> 02:21:12,380
Yeah, it is scary.

4728
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:18,020
She's so paranoid.

4729
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:20,020
She's so paranoid.

4730
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:24,080
Two steps box.

4731
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:25,060
Here we go.

4732
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:25,500
Yeah, yeah.

4733
02:21:25,560 --> 02:21:26,640
Nice, nice box.

4734
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:28,080
Nice, okay.

4735
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:32,000
Oh, they can hit you.

4736
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:33,660
So you can't unbox it in time.

4737
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:33,960
No way.

4738
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:34,960
What the hell?

4739
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:38,520
It's risky because you can't see exactly how far people are spread out under the box.

4740
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:40,000
So there might be some tailenders.

4741
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:41,060
Who has it?

4742
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:42,600
Oh god, I'm not good at this.

4743
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:43,120
Oh no.

4744
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:44,460
You're gonna be great.

4745
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:45,120
It's okay.

4746
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,280
You can jump off the ledge if you don't want to do it.

4747
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:47,600
You're good.

4748
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,720
You can jump off the ledge.

4749
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:53,100
I think that's the most like, pussy way out ever.

4750
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:54,800
Don't worry, I can do it for you.

4751
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:55,900
I can't move.

4752
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:56,860
I can't go forward.

4753
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:58,460
You guys are literally pointing a wall.

4754
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:02,160
All you need to do is lock in.

4755
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:03,360
Fill the wall router.

4756
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:05,500
Okay.

4757
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:06,960
Nice, clean.

4758
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:07,700
No, go.

4759
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:08,480
No, no, no, no, no.

4760
02:22:08,980 --> 02:22:09,380
Patience.

4761
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:10,400
Okay, after this one.

4762
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,320
Oh, okay.

4763
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:12,440
Patience.

4764
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:14,140
Okay.

4765
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:16,280
After this.

4766
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:17,960
All right, nice, nice, nice.

4767
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:20,640
Okay, nice.

4768
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:21,820
Slow and steady.

4769
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,820
Slow and steady.

4770
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:24,480
Okay.

4771
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:25,400
Okay, okay, okay.

4772
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:26,720
And then we can go up.

4773
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:27,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4774
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,000
Okay.

4775
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:28,540
Oh, okay.

4776
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:29,180
Are we going up?

4777
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:30,100
Okay, okay, okay.

4778
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,320
Oh, no.

4779
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:31,880
Oh, no.

4780
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:32,580
Oh, no.

4781
02:22:33,660 --> 02:22:38,720
I think it's a little confusing because if people walk forward without me, then I get scared.

4782
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:41,080
But I can't go ahead because it's like body blocking.

4783
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:41,920
Yeah.

4784
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:42,960
No, me again?

4785
02:22:43,100 --> 02:22:43,360
No.

4786
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:43,560
It's okay.

4787
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:44,120
Don't worry.

4788
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:45,640
This is your training arc.

4789
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,140
Oh, yeah.

4790
02:22:48,020 --> 02:22:50,120
It was just a training arc.

4791
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:50,160
This is your training arc.

4792
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:52,520
So I was like, all right, that's the sign.

4793
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:53,140
Oh, I know.

4794
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:53,980
I know.

4795
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:56,000
Okay.

4796
02:22:57,640 --> 02:22:58,600
Okay, who's next?

4797
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:00,000
Oh, okay.

4798
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:01,540
Give me the box.

4799
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:03,640
Give me the box.

4800
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:04,040
This is nonsense.

4801
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:04,500
It's me.

4802
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:05,040
This is me.

4803
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:05,180
Page.

4804
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:07,660
Page is like no.

4805
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:09,340
Not Amelie.

4806
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:10,040
I'm sorry.

4807
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:10,060
Sorry, girl.

4808
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:10,540
Please!

4809
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:11,080
No.

4810
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:12,020
Not Amelie.

4811
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,360
We're trapped!

4812
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:14,620
Okay.

4813
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:16,540
Okay, all right.

4814
02:23:16,660 --> 02:23:17,220
Let's go after this one.

4815
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:18,360
Let's go.

4816
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:19,080
Oh.

4817
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:20,280
Oh, no.

4818
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:20,840
We're fine.

4819
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:22,800
Hang on, hang on.

4820
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:23,360
Wait for them to sing.

4821
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:24,340
Wait, wait, wait.

4822
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:25,300
Okay, I'm going to go.

4823
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:25,720
I'm going to go.

4824
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:26,120
I'm going to go.

4825
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:26,340
I'm boxing.

4826
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:27,100
Boxing.

4827
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:27,580
Boxing.

4828
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:33,840
Okay, this one?

4829
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:34,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4830
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:34,860
For sure, for sure.

4831
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:36,320
Alright, we're good.

4832
02:23:36,700 --> 02:23:37,060
Nice.

4833
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,000
Oh!

4834
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,360
Oh!

4835
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:40,400
Okay, sure.

4836
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:40,700
Okay.

4837
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:43,240
It's okay, you're fine.

4838
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:44,760
Okay, not trust.

4839
02:23:45,820 --> 02:23:46,720
You could've gone!

4840
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:47,440
You could've gone!

4841
02:23:47,900 --> 02:23:49,400
Oh, that's a shadow.

4842
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:50,200
Oh, I'm crazy.

4843
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:51,120
I'm actually crazy.

4844
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:51,540
Fuck!

4845
02:23:52,180 --> 02:23:53,880
Alright, go now.

4846
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:54,280
Go now.

4847
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4848
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,000
Alright, box, box, box.

4849
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:56,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4850
02:23:56,980 --> 02:23:58,840
Wait for them to pass us.

4851
02:23:58,900 --> 02:23:59,540
Wait for them.

4852
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:00,500
Okay.

4853
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,320
Go, go, go, go, go.

4854
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:03,340
We can just box.

4855
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:04,180
We can just box.

4856
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:04,800
That's fine too.

4857
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:05,920
Okay, it's fine.

4858
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:06,520
Nice.

4859
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:07,920
Do not fall into the pit.

4860
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:10,200
Listen to me.

4861
02:24:10,380 --> 02:24:10,680
Guys, guys.

4862
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:11,940
Don't fall in.

4863
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:13,620
Okay.

4864
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:17,780
Mint, if you really wanna be Metal Gear, you can do something funny.

4865
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:18,420
I was gonna say.

4866
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:19,520
I was gonna say.

4867
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:20,960
If you really wanna do it.

4868
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,900
I really wanted to be in the box again.

4869
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:24,860
It's my destiny to be in the box.

4870
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:26,700
We might have another level with bombs.

4871
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:31,140
I said this was Metal Gear earlier and everyone made fun of me.

4872
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:32,120
Alright, Mint, you know.

4873
02:24:32,300 --> 02:24:32,880
No, I'm just saying.

4874
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:33,260
You should do it.

4875
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:35,960
Don't be so funny.

4876
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:38,760
I'm just saying.

4877
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:41,300
Don't be so funny.

4878
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:42,940
The darkness.

4879
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:44,440
The darkness.

4880
02:24:44,860 --> 02:24:45,360
The darkness.

4881
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:49,920
Don't you wanna do the box?

4882
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:51,200
Don't you?

4883
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:55,480
I can't hear you.

4884
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:58,360
Do it.

4885
02:24:59,160 --> 02:24:59,960
Do it.

4886
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:02,320
The green goblin.

4887
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:03,220
Jump.

4888
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:06,360
Jump.

4889
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:08,000
Don't be a pussy.

4890
02:25:08,820 --> 02:25:09,340
Jump.

4891
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:11,400
Oh my god.

4892
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:12,460
Don't do it.

4893
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:14,020
Don't do it.

4894
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:21,200
There's so much.

4895
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:22,000
There's so much.

4896
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:23,340
There's so much.

4897
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:23,680
Toki.

4898
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:24,320
Toki.

4899
02:25:24,420 --> 02:25:24,940
Toki.

4900
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:25,500
Toki.

4901
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:27,860
How do I get out of the room?

4902
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:29,980
Get off the ledge, Toki.

4903
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:31,300
Don't tell her how to get out of the room.

4904
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:33,060
I made it.

4905
02:25:33,140 --> 02:25:33,660
I made it.

4906
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:36,580
Mint, you wanna do the box, right?

4907
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:37,560
Do it.

4908
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:39,600
It's not a job.

4909
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:42,220
Alright.

4910
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:43,580
Alright.

4911
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:49,720
Alright, we gotta make sure Mint gets there.

4912
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:51,360
No, wait.

4913
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:52,320
No, actually.

4914
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:52,980
No.

4915
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:56,080
No.

4916
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:05,880
It's okay.

4917
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:07,000
No, Toki.

4918
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,580
You can't have this privilege.

4919
02:26:14,930 --> 02:26:16,530
Oh my god.

4920
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:19,050
I want Lime to have the box.

4921
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:21,070
I can't fucking take it anymore.

4922
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:26,470
We'll do a level where Lime takes us to the end and then we'll do a level where Pink takes us to the end.

4923
02:26:26,470 --> 02:26:27,150
Oh my god.

4924
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:32,570
Can we do another level with all of our hands?

4925
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:38,710
Your present to me for me not having the box is just to let the level end.

4926
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:39,690
Please.

4927
02:26:39,690 --> 02:26:42,070
Let me go fuck out.

4928
02:26:43,350 --> 02:26:44,950
No, we already committed.

4929
02:26:46,530 --> 02:26:47,490
Oh my god.

4930
02:26:47,490 --> 02:26:50,370
Do you realize how many times it took for me to get the box?

4931
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:50,550
We won.

4932
02:26:51,030 --> 02:26:52,650
We'll never get it.

4933
02:26:52,650 --> 02:26:52,970
It's fine.

4934
02:26:54,130 --> 02:26:54,970
Just go.

4935
02:26:54,990 --> 02:26:55,850
Just go.

4936
02:26:58,170 --> 02:27:01,150
I redeemed myself and you guys are going away.

4937
02:27:03,050 --> 02:27:03,810
No, okay.

4938
02:27:04,590 --> 02:27:07,610
I like how they're like, no, Mint and Lime should have the box.

4939
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:09,110
And Mint and Lime are like, please, no.

4940
02:27:09,250 --> 02:27:09,670
Just fuck off.

4941
02:27:09,690 --> 02:27:10,090
We'll keep going.

4942
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:13,010
It will work.

4943
02:27:13,850 --> 02:27:16,110
It's either Mint or Lime will get it.

4944
02:27:16,110 --> 02:27:17,010
Why is it always me?

4945
02:27:17,010 --> 02:27:18,010
Why is it always you?

4946
02:27:18,170 --> 02:27:19,770
I think because you keep dying.

4947
02:27:20,510 --> 02:27:22,170
Alright, then Mint, you jump off.

4948
02:27:22,570 --> 02:27:23,590
Yeah, yeah, you jump off.

4949
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:24,510
Okay, for science.

4950
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:26,650
Yeah, for science.

4951
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:28,090
He's like, what?

4952
02:27:30,570 --> 02:27:31,050
Yay.

4953
02:27:37,650 --> 02:27:38,850
We're trapped here.

4954
02:27:38,910 --> 02:27:41,810
We're not It's not because we're dumb.

4955
02:27:41,970 --> 02:27:42,370
We have the box.

4956
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:46,170
Alright, I'm taking a peek.

4957
02:27:46,270 --> 02:27:46,430
Alright, I'm taking a peek.

4958
02:27:46,990 --> 02:27:47,870
Oh, no.

4959
02:27:49,010 --> 02:27:50,430
Please, lead us to victory.

4960
02:27:50,750 --> 02:27:51,930
I want to escape.

4961
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:53,770
This is it.

4962
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:54,490
Let me out.

4963
02:27:55,930 --> 02:27:57,690
I don't have the fight in me.

4964
02:27:57,850 --> 02:27:59,970
You guys have to role play with me, okay?

4965
02:28:00,850 --> 02:28:01,290
Okay.

4966
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:08,230
Okay, what are we role-playing?

4967
02:28:08,510 --> 02:28:10,370
Wait, we have to wait for Amelie to come back.

4968
02:28:15,670 --> 02:28:16,870
What about you?

4969
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:19,590
Lime, do you want the box?

4970
02:28:23,370 --> 02:28:25,230
We don't want the box anymore.

4971
02:28:25,650 --> 02:28:27,450
Just put the box on top of her.

4972
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:29,350
Just go down and put the box on top of her.

4973
02:28:31,290 --> 02:28:32,330
I won't take her with us.

4974
02:28:32,390 --> 02:28:34,150
Yeah, I can't move with the box.

4975
02:28:34,410 --> 02:28:35,490
Fake Metal Gear.

4976
02:28:35,710 --> 02:28:37,490
Yeah, but we start the role-play now.

4977
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,690
Oh, okay.

4978
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:40,470
Build a scene.

4979
02:28:40,690 --> 02:28:41,930
Let's do some world building.

4980
02:28:42,310 --> 02:28:42,790
Yeah.

4981
02:28:43,490 --> 02:28:44,610
Okay, what's the scene?

4982
02:28:45,010 --> 02:28:47,570
With the bat.

4983
02:28:48,330 --> 02:28:48,810
Okay.

4984
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:50,270
How do we get here?

4985
02:28:50,490 --> 02:28:51,530
What are we trying to steal?

4986
02:28:52,450 --> 02:28:55,610
We're trying to destroy Metal Gear.

4987
02:28:57,010 --> 02:28:57,570
Oh.

4988
02:28:59,510 --> 02:29:00,790
My name is... I'm Placid Snake.

4989
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:02,210
So Jumble has done it again.

4990
02:29:02,570 --> 02:29:03,550
Placid Snake.

4991
02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:04,130
Placid.

4992
02:29:04,130 --> 02:29:04,590
Yeah, I'm Placid Snake.

4993
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:05,130
Okay.

4994
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:07,290
Alright, I'll be Plastic Snake.

4995
02:29:07,510 --> 02:29:08,070
Plastic Snake.

4996
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:09,110
Plastic Snake, that's good.

4997
02:29:09,210 --> 02:29:09,430
Yeah.

4998
02:29:10,310 --> 02:29:11,410
Okay, who else?

4999
02:29:11,790 --> 02:29:12,750
I'm Dysfunctional Snake.

5000
02:29:12,750 --> 02:29:13,250
We can have as many snakes.

5001
02:29:14,290 --> 02:29:15,050
Dysfunctional Snake.

5002
02:29:15,430 --> 02:29:19,230
They sound like Toontown auto-generated names.

5003
02:29:20,890 --> 02:29:21,990
That's so real.

5004
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:23,430
I'm Sniffer Snake.

5005
02:29:23,790 --> 02:29:24,950
I'm Sleepy Snake.

5006
02:29:25,610 --> 02:29:27,650
Someone has to be Jurassic Snake.

5007
02:29:27,990 --> 02:29:29,190
Jurassic Snake?

5008
02:29:29,190 --> 02:29:30,410
I'll be Jurassic Snake.

5009
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:32,750
Yeah.

5010
02:29:33,310 --> 02:29:34,530
Yeah, you are.

5011
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:36,810
I can't remember what anyone...

5012
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:41,730
Alright, I'm back.

5013
02:29:41,810 --> 02:29:42,230
Have we...

5014
02:29:42,230 --> 02:29:43,690
Alright, now we're role-playing.

5015
02:29:44,230 --> 02:29:46,290
We just got Mint the Box.

5016
02:29:46,590 --> 02:29:46,930
Incredible.

5017
02:29:46,930 --> 02:29:47,390
Now we must...

5018
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:49,790
What's your snake name, Amelie?

5019
02:29:49,790 --> 02:29:50,750
What's your snake name?

5020
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:53,730
Blasted Snake.

5021
02:29:54,090 --> 02:29:55,010
Blasted Snake.

5022
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:55,050
Blasted Snake.

5023
02:29:56,090 --> 02:29:57,130
Alright, here we go.

5024
02:29:57,190 --> 02:29:57,810
This is it.

5025
02:29:58,030 --> 02:29:59,270
I thought you said Plastered Snake.

5026
02:30:00,290 --> 02:30:01,550
That's a good one, too, actually.

5027
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:01,910
No, that's you, Snuffy.

5028
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:05,010
Everyone can get in.

5029
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:06,010
We're all good.

5030
02:30:06,450 --> 02:30:09,570
Alright, after this next one, after this next one, I'm moving.

5031
02:30:12,090 --> 02:30:13,170
You got that?

5032
02:30:13,450 --> 02:30:13,850
Alright.

5033
02:30:15,210 --> 02:30:16,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5034
02:30:17,890 --> 02:30:18,330
Yeah.

5035
02:30:18,330 --> 02:30:19,030
Let him sink.

5036
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:19,550
Let him sink.

5037
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:22,130
Somebody give us BGM from Metal Gear.

5038
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:23,670
Duh-duh.

5039
02:30:23,890 --> 02:30:25,170
Duh-duh-duh.

5040
02:30:25,170 --> 02:30:26,810
Duh-duh-duh.

5041
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:28,930
Go, go, go.

5042
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:30,410
Oh, sorry.

5043
02:30:30,650 --> 02:30:31,610
Oh, get in the box!

5044
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:32,150
Get in the box!

5045
02:30:33,550 --> 02:30:36,330
I was going to say, after all we've done.

5046
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:38,990
Okay, okay, okay.

5047
02:30:39,050 --> 02:30:41,610
Who just sentenced us into the pit for 5000 years?

5048
02:30:41,790 --> 02:30:42,110
Okay.

5049
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:42,690
Get in the box!

5050
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:45,230
Run, run, run!

5051
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:46,210
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

5052
02:30:46,290 --> 02:30:46,810
Get in the box!

5053
02:30:46,830 --> 02:30:47,290
Get in the box!

5054
02:30:47,310 --> 02:30:47,330
Get in the box!

5055
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:47,650
Okay, your okay.

5056
02:30:47,770 --> 02:30:47,910
Your okay.

5057
02:30:48,230 --> 02:30:48,890
Get in the box!

5058
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:50,610
Oh, my god.

5059
02:30:50,610 --> 02:30:51,610
Okay, just get out of the way.

5060
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:54,170
Just- Lime is on the edge.

5061
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:54,190
You can wave!

5062
02:30:54,190 --> 02:30:55,910
Lime is living on the edge.

5063
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:58,410
Lime was like, watch this though.

5064
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:04,790
Okay guys, everybody single file Lime and get into the door.

5065
02:31:05,030 --> 02:31:08,150
I will scream so hard that Sonic will explode.

5066
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:09,990
All I'm saying is that Lime didn't have a chance to be Metal Gear.

5067
02:31:10,130 --> 02:31:10,890
That's all I'm saying.

5068
02:31:11,250 --> 02:31:13,370
I'm going to mail you my head in a box.

5069
02:31:13,470 --> 02:31:16,190
It's too fat to fit through the...

5070
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:18,350
How are you going to send it in the mail if you're already...

5071
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:25,150
Thanks for letting me be John Metal Gear.

5072
02:31:25,630 --> 02:31:26,710
You're welcome.

5073
02:31:28,270 --> 02:31:30,390
Now happy to do it.

5074
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:32,590
We did it guys.

5075
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,750
We did it.

5076
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:34,910
Oh no.

5077
02:31:35,770 --> 02:31:36,730
We have to...

5078
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:39,510
Everyone go down your own little path.

5079
02:31:40,090 --> 02:31:42,310
We all have our own path in life.

5080
02:31:42,490 --> 02:31:43,290
This is my path.

5081
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:44,690
Find your path.

5082
02:31:44,710 --> 02:31:45,750
This is my hole.

5083
02:31:48,350 --> 02:31:49,470
It was made for me.

5084
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:51,470
Okay, everybody be careful on your path.

5085
02:31:53,810 --> 02:31:55,850
I feel like it's the corner.

5086
02:31:57,270 --> 02:32:02,490
You guys, there is a fan up there.

5087
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:09,990
We've got to sink the corners.

5088
02:32:10,310 --> 02:32:12,850
Guys please, this is supposed to fit me in this hole.

5089
02:32:15,570 --> 02:32:17,590
Get to the corner and then pause.

5090
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:19,390
Just pause.

5091
02:32:20,030 --> 02:32:20,830
And then...

5092
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:22,670
Oh no.

5093
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:24,510
I think you've got to get over.

5094
02:32:25,310 --> 02:32:26,110
Someone's pulling, right?

5095
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:29,270
It's not going to be everybody's pulling.

5096
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:30,390
Yeah, we're all pulling.

5097
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:31,130
We're all connected.

5098
02:32:31,650 --> 02:32:32,310
It could have been everybody.

5099
02:32:32,470 --> 02:32:35,170
It could be any one of us.

5100
02:32:35,230 --> 02:32:35,750
It could be you.

5101
02:32:35,810 --> 02:32:36,430
It could be me.

5102
02:32:36,750 --> 02:32:37,150
Pause, pause.

5103
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,930
Go left and pause.

5104
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:43,330
Who didn't pause?

5105
02:32:44,270 --> 02:32:44,990
I paused.

5106
02:32:45,870 --> 02:32:46,870
I tried to pause.

5107
02:32:48,470 --> 02:32:48,950
Alright.

5108
02:32:53,610 --> 02:32:54,570
Everybody pause.

5109
02:32:55,050 --> 02:32:56,930
Then go to the other corner and pause.

5110
02:32:57,550 --> 02:32:58,350
Okay, pause.

5111
02:32:58,730 --> 02:33:00,090
We're all going to go together.

5112
02:33:03,110 --> 02:33:05,570
Now we're going to go down this.

5113
02:33:05,630 --> 02:33:07,190
I think we should just run for it.

5114
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:08,250
Run, run, run.

5115
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:12,530
I heard run.

5116
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:15,130
We were doing so good.

5117
02:33:15,130 --> 02:33:16,550
We were doing so literally flawless.

5118
02:33:16,870 --> 02:33:17,810
And we were like...

5119
02:33:19,930 --> 02:33:21,050
It's the fence.

5120
02:33:21,550 --> 02:33:22,490
It's the fence.

5121
02:33:22,710 --> 02:33:24,150
We've got to go past the fence.

5122
02:33:25,030 --> 02:33:25,590
Run.

5123
02:33:27,810 --> 02:33:28,370
Run.

5124
02:33:29,830 --> 02:33:32,230
We went from precision to this.

5125
02:33:34,030 --> 02:33:35,750
Every people for themselves.

5126
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:35,770
It's the fence.

5127
02:33:35,770 --> 02:33:37,890
We can't get caught by the doki doki.

5128
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:38,930
I'm not pulling.

5129
02:33:39,230 --> 02:33:39,950
What do you want from me?

5130
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:43,890
First corner.

5131
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,790
First corner.

5132
02:33:45,690 --> 02:33:47,250
Go straight and pause.

5133
02:33:49,010 --> 02:33:50,050
Everybody pause.

5134
02:33:50,050 --> 02:33:51,410
I'm watching all of you.

5135
02:33:51,490 --> 02:33:51,950
Okay, left.

5136
02:33:52,170 --> 02:33:53,570
Okay, now pause.

5137
02:33:53,770 --> 02:33:54,970
Now we're going to go up.

5138
02:33:55,890 --> 02:33:58,030
Now we're going to go to the left and then pause.

5139
02:33:58,410 --> 02:34:00,090
And then walk the catwalk.

5140
02:34:00,390 --> 02:34:01,970
What do we do about bow and the fence?

5141
02:34:02,270 --> 02:34:02,590
No!

5142
02:34:04,150 --> 02:34:04,670
Doki!

5143
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:05,550
What do you mean?

5144
02:34:05,730 --> 02:34:07,390
Bow dropped two at the same time.

5145
02:34:07,430 --> 02:34:09,970
Bow dropped two at the same time.

5146
02:34:12,010 --> 02:34:14,490
All three of us died.

5147
02:34:14,490 --> 02:34:16,190
Bow was fighting a fan.

5148
02:34:16,390 --> 02:34:17,150
You have no excuse.

5149
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:19,750
I have no excuse.

5150
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:21,450
You're laughing.

5151
02:34:21,930 --> 02:34:22,450
Corner.

5152
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:23,510
Goodbye.

5153
02:34:24,750 --> 02:34:25,270
Goodbye.

5154
02:34:26,550 --> 02:34:27,070
Goodbye.

5155
02:34:27,270 --> 02:34:29,470
You know it's bad when I become the leader.

5156
02:34:31,150 --> 02:34:32,270
You're in the middle.

5157
02:34:32,390 --> 02:34:33,990
You have the easiest job.

5158
02:34:34,070 --> 02:34:34,810
You're in the middle.

5159
02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:37,870
It is super chill in the middle.

5160
02:34:38,010 --> 02:34:39,230
This is really nice.

5161
02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:41,470
Walk the little catwalk.

5162
02:34:41,550 --> 02:34:42,050
Pause.

5163
02:34:43,610 --> 02:34:44,470
Nudge to the right.

5164
02:34:44,490 --> 02:34:46,210
And I think bow might have to...

5165
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:47,630
I'm not sure about bow.

5166
02:34:47,830 --> 02:34:50,530
But we just got to move right while moving forward.

5167
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:51,490
To counteract the fence.

5168
02:34:51,830 --> 02:34:54,110
Just don't overcompensate too much.

5169
02:34:54,210 --> 02:34:56,450
Just do it perfectly and you'll be fine.

5170
02:34:56,670 --> 02:34:56,890
Yeah.

5171
02:34:57,830 --> 02:34:58,810
Walk the catwalk.

5172
02:34:59,150 --> 02:34:59,670
No!

5173
02:35:00,670 --> 02:35:01,190
Doki!

5174
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:03,910
I walked!

5175
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:05,170
I went up!

5176
02:35:05,170 --> 02:35:06,410
I swear to god!

5177
02:35:06,950 --> 02:35:08,170
I went up!

5178
02:35:08,590 --> 02:35:11,270
My hands are getting greasy from the sweat.

5179
02:35:12,310 --> 02:35:12,830
Okay.

5180
02:35:14,490 --> 02:35:20,450
We should do a pancake flip and make Doki have to be sentenced to seem just exactly the kind of hell that bow is.

5181
02:35:21,910 --> 02:35:23,950
Maybe you'll sing a different tune.

5182
02:35:23,950 --> 02:35:26,470
Go to bow's house and take her spot right now.

5183
02:35:27,070 --> 02:35:28,130
Play on your computer.

5184
02:35:28,330 --> 02:35:28,890
Oh yeah!

5185
02:35:29,970 --> 02:35:31,310
I got pushed off!

5186
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:32,730
I got pushed off by the fence!

5187
02:35:32,730 --> 02:35:33,110
That's karma.

5188
02:35:33,270 --> 02:35:34,970
That's fucking karma right there.

5189
02:35:35,770 --> 02:35:36,710
I made it.

5190
02:35:36,710 --> 02:35:37,090
You know what?

5191
02:35:37,090 --> 02:35:37,470
You know what?

5192
02:35:37,630 --> 02:35:38,730
I'm coming over there!

5193
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:40,610
I'm coming over there!

5194
02:35:41,810 --> 02:35:43,230
I'm taking you down!

5195
02:35:44,250 --> 02:35:45,830
Doki, I'm taking you down!

5196
02:35:45,870 --> 02:35:46,150
Yeah!

5197
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:50,890
I say we let Doki do the fan.

5198
02:35:51,070 --> 02:35:52,330
Doki, you do the fan.

5199
02:35:52,390 --> 02:35:53,050
Yeah, let's do it!

5200
02:35:53,310 --> 02:35:54,250
Let's do the fan!

5201
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:55,110
That's right!

5202
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:56,150
I'll do it!

5203
02:35:56,250 --> 02:35:56,750
Okay, okay.

5204
02:35:57,390 --> 02:35:58,630
Wait a minute, Marty.

5205
02:36:00,530 --> 02:36:01,550
Pause the corner.

5206
02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:06,250
You guys are so fast!

5207
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:08,110
Okay, okay.

5208
02:36:08,710 --> 02:36:09,370
Okay, okay.

5209
02:36:10,610 --> 02:36:10,830
Switch again.

5210
02:36:11,050 --> 02:36:11,550
Switch again.

5211
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:12,110
Rotate.

5212
02:36:12,690 --> 02:36:13,130
Rotate.

5213
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:15,270
Nudge to the corner.

5214
02:36:15,350 --> 02:36:17,890
I like how I end up basically in the same lane.

5215
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:20,070
And then left.

5216
02:36:20,370 --> 02:36:21,490
Walk the little catwalk.

5217
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:22,490
Doki, you're going too fast.

5218
02:36:23,730 --> 02:36:24,170
No!

5219
02:36:24,990 --> 02:36:27,530
Yeah, it's not so easy back there, is it?

5220
02:36:27,910 --> 02:36:28,690
Oh my god!

5221
02:36:28,770 --> 02:36:29,370
Shut up!

5222
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:29,970
Shut up!

5223
02:36:35,330 --> 02:36:36,490
Nudge to the corner.

5224
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:39,090
Walk a mile in someone else's shoes.

5225
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,890
This is great.

5226
02:36:40,610 --> 02:36:41,110
To the corner.

5227
02:36:42,190 --> 02:36:44,230
That's not so easy over there, is it, Doki?

5228
02:36:44,650 --> 02:36:46,310
It is so easy!

5229
02:36:48,410 --> 02:36:50,070
This is fabricated.

5230
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:51,450
Okay.

5231
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:53,610
Okay.

5232
02:36:54,170 --> 02:36:55,470
Farming street mallards.

5233
02:36:55,830 --> 02:36:56,630
To the corner.

5234
02:36:57,630 --> 02:36:58,150
Pause.

5235
02:36:58,810 --> 02:37:00,450
Okay, then go to the left a little bit.

5236
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:02,310
Walk the tiny catwalk.

5237
02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:04,250
Nudge to the right.

5238
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:06,270
Now walk the big catwalk.

5239
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:07,350
You got that, Doki.

5240
02:37:07,490 --> 02:37:08,270
You got that, Doki.

5241
02:37:08,370 --> 02:37:08,910
You got that.

5242
02:37:10,610 --> 02:37:11,410
I saw the first time.

5243
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:12,110
I saw the first time.

5244
02:37:13,370 --> 02:37:15,470
I saw the first time.

5245
02:37:15,470 --> 02:37:18,030
I saw the exit.

5246
02:37:18,530 --> 02:37:19,390
I saw it.

5247
02:37:19,390 --> 02:37:20,830
I saw the light.

5248
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:22,250
I saw the light.

5249
02:37:22,790 --> 02:37:25,050
I know.

5250
02:37:25,170 --> 02:37:26,330
To the corner.

5251
02:37:27,050 --> 02:37:28,810
You're going to walk a little bit.

5252
02:37:30,750 --> 02:37:32,770
Now wait a minute.

5253
02:37:33,170 --> 02:37:33,950
I know.

5254
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:36,530
Now wait a minute.

5255
02:37:36,670 --> 02:37:37,230
I know.

5256
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:38,290
I know.

5257
02:37:38,850 --> 02:37:41,610
Maybe both Val and Doki are the problem.

5258
02:37:41,930 --> 02:37:43,050
The problem!

5259
02:37:43,210 --> 02:37:43,810
No!

5260
02:37:44,230 --> 02:37:47,010
I think we've established the weak link on this one.

5261
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:51,110
That's easy to say for the middle people.

5262
02:37:51,310 --> 02:37:51,570
Yeah.

5263
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:54,850
The middle people think they have all of it.

5264
02:37:55,410 --> 02:37:56,430
We aren't.

5265
02:37:56,430 --> 02:37:56,850
We aren't.

5266
02:37:56,950 --> 02:38:04,990
The middle people are district one and then we're all on.

5267
02:38:08,250 --> 02:38:09,370
Of course.

5268
02:38:09,530 --> 02:38:12,970
Of course the middle people think it's so hard.

5269
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:17,310
You guys even said earlier it's real cozy in there.

5270
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:19,070
I'm sorry, I can't carry it.

5271
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:21,110
You are too rich and comfortable in the middle.

5272
02:38:22,210 --> 02:38:25,790
I'm a key holder, so I think you should cater to me.

5273
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:29,090
Do we still need to flip every time?

5274
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:31,510
Why don't we just go down a single one together?

5275
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:33,770
No, because we need to push the buttons.

5276
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:35,030
We need to push the buttons.

5277
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:36,270
Wait, I know which button though.

5278
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:38,790
But there is buttons everywhere.

5279
02:38:39,470 --> 02:38:42,430
I thought there was just one that was the right button.

5280
02:38:42,910 --> 02:38:44,710
I'm pretty sure they all need to be pushed.

5281
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:46,690
That's very reasonable.

5282
02:38:46,830 --> 02:38:47,790
The corner and then pause.

5283
02:38:48,030 --> 02:38:49,430
The corner and then pause.

5284
02:38:53,910 --> 02:38:54,910
We're regressing.

5285
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:55,710
We're regressing.

5286
02:39:01,490 --> 02:39:02,730
Slowly inchworm up.

5287
02:39:03,070 --> 02:39:03,750
To the corner.

5288
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:03,890
To the corner.

5289
02:39:04,150 --> 02:39:05,210
Wait for your friends.

5290
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:05,950
Hold them off.

5291
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:06,490
Let them go.

5292
02:39:06,490 --> 02:39:07,210
Wait, wait.

5293
02:39:07,370 --> 02:39:08,610
Okay, inch to the left.

5294
02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:09,450
Wait, wait.

5295
02:39:09,710 --> 02:39:11,650
Go up, go up.

5296
02:39:11,690 --> 02:39:12,110
Let's go.

5297
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:12,510
Let's go.

5298
02:39:12,590 --> 02:39:13,170
Wait, wait.

5299
02:39:13,530 --> 02:39:14,530
A little bit to the right.

5300
02:39:14,590 --> 02:39:15,170
Wait, wait.

5301
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:16,030
Okay, go, go, go.

5302
02:39:16,270 --> 02:39:17,050
Try your best.

5303
02:39:17,550 --> 02:39:18,490
Hold each other up.

5304
02:39:18,630 --> 02:39:18,790
No!

5305
02:39:19,530 --> 02:39:19,930
Doki.

5306
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:21,010
I got Doki.

5307
02:39:21,710 --> 02:39:22,750
I got the middle.

5308
02:39:23,050 --> 02:39:23,750
You know what?

5309
02:39:23,850 --> 02:39:25,150
I think it was the middle people.

5310
02:39:25,810 --> 02:39:27,870
The middle people pulled me.

5311
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:31,530
It was sabotage from the people in the middle.

5312
02:39:32,050 --> 02:39:33,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5313
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:34,130
Excuse me?

5314
02:39:35,230 --> 02:39:36,330
I'm just chilling.

5315
02:39:36,470 --> 02:39:38,210
I'm not participating in this nonsense.

5316
02:39:40,110 --> 02:39:40,550
Wow.

5317
02:39:41,090 --> 02:39:42,290
I'm only going too fast.

5318
02:39:42,350 --> 02:39:42,990
I think you just pulled me.

5319
02:39:42,990 --> 02:39:43,570
Yeah, you're right.

5320
02:39:43,730 --> 02:39:46,130
Yeah, you pulled me in Juniper.

5321
02:39:46,430 --> 02:39:48,330
You pulled me in a sneeze for one minute.

5322
02:39:49,170 --> 02:39:49,850
Holy shit.

5323
02:39:50,590 --> 02:39:51,030
Holy.

5324
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:52,170
All right, here we go.

5325
02:39:52,330 --> 02:39:53,310
This is the time.

5326
02:39:53,310 --> 02:39:53,570
This is the time.

5327
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:53,950
Synchronization.

5328
02:39:55,750 --> 02:39:56,670
What's your friends?

5329
02:39:56,710 --> 02:39:57,430
What's your fellows?

5330
02:39:57,610 --> 02:39:57,890
Left.

5331
02:39:57,910 --> 02:39:58,270
Left.

5332
02:39:58,270 --> 02:39:58,870
Okay, and left.

5333
02:39:58,910 --> 02:39:59,130
Wait.

5334
02:39:59,370 --> 02:40:00,630
And up, girls.

5335
02:40:00,770 --> 02:40:01,350
Let's go.

5336
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:01,970
Yeah.

5337
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:02,790
And to the right.

5338
02:40:02,790 --> 02:40:03,050
And to the left.

5339
02:40:03,050 --> 02:40:03,510
And to the right.

5340
02:40:03,550 --> 02:40:03,830
And to the right, girls.

5341
02:40:03,890 --> 02:40:04,630
Girls, you're fucking dead.

5342
02:40:04,850 --> 02:40:07,130
That was my first sniff.

5343
02:40:07,150 --> 02:40:08,130
I was like, I get one!

5344
02:40:08,210 --> 02:40:08,670
I get one!

5345
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:11,050
All right, here we go.

5346
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:14,050
It's day 335.

5347
02:40:15,270 --> 02:40:15,790
Bro!

5348
02:40:16,290 --> 02:40:16,850
Bro!

5349
02:40:17,490 --> 02:40:17,910
Bro!

5350
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:18,150
Bro!

5351
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:26,670
I've been here for 300 days!

5352
02:40:27,550 --> 02:40:30,210
I'm here for 300 days.

5353
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:32,330
Why is this not randomized?!

5354
02:40:32,330 --> 02:40:33,030
But she pulls the bullies.

5355
02:40:33,050 --> 02:40:35,270
Just pull me across, please.

5356
02:40:36,070 --> 02:40:40,670
Everything else was randomized, but now this one decides not to be.

5357
02:40:40,870 --> 02:40:41,530
Wait, wait, wait.

5358
02:40:41,970 --> 02:40:44,130
Wait on the buttons, wait on the buttons.

5359
02:40:44,130 --> 02:40:45,370
Okay, get into position.

5360
02:40:45,850 --> 02:40:46,490
Positions?

5361
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:47,410
Yeah.

5362
02:40:47,410 --> 02:40:48,090
Positions, girls?

5363
02:40:48,250 --> 02:40:49,710
Okay, go girls.

5364
02:40:50,070 --> 02:40:51,270
Go girls, go girls.

5365
02:40:51,590 --> 02:40:51,610
No!

5366
02:40:51,610 --> 02:40:52,150
I'm sorry!

5367
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:57,370
I got pulled to the left!

5368
02:40:57,730 --> 02:40:59,790
I actually made it!

5369
02:41:02,990 --> 02:41:04,410
Okay, here we go.

5370
02:41:04,410 --> 02:41:05,890
Okay, this is it, I believe.

5371
02:41:06,030 --> 02:41:06,210
So cursed.

5372
02:41:06,310 --> 02:41:07,370
Alright, let's go.

5373
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:08,430
Go, go, go, go, go.

5374
02:41:08,590 --> 02:41:11,270
Up you get, up you get, up you get, wait.

5375
02:41:11,530 --> 02:41:13,210
Up you get, up you get.

5376
02:41:13,450 --> 02:41:15,950
Left, left, up you go, up you go, up you go, up you go.

5377
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:16,810
Buttons, keys.

5378
02:41:16,810 --> 02:41:18,470
Okay, butt to the right, line up.

5379
02:41:18,470 --> 02:41:19,770
Everybody ready, and go.

5380
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:21,490
Go girls, go girls, go girls.

5381
02:41:23,150 --> 02:41:24,250
Ain't no way.

5382
02:41:26,050 --> 02:41:27,550
Should we stop flipping?

5383
02:41:27,970 --> 02:41:29,470
Maybe we should stop flipping.

5384
02:41:29,770 --> 02:41:31,850
Okay, go ahead, Vi, it's your turn.

5385
02:41:31,870 --> 02:41:34,190
Yeah, we're gonna turn into our normal size.

5386
02:41:35,290 --> 02:41:36,610
Up you get in honor.

5387
02:41:36,650 --> 02:41:37,070
Go, go, go.

5388
02:41:37,270 --> 02:41:37,890
Go, go, go.

5389
02:41:38,170 --> 02:41:38,870
Go, go, go.

5390
02:41:39,930 --> 02:41:40,330
Go, girl.

5391
02:41:40,330 --> 02:41:41,630
This is probably a pain issue.

5392
02:41:41,850 --> 02:41:41,930
And wait.

5393
02:41:41,930 --> 02:41:42,290
Left girl.

5394
02:41:42,290 --> 02:41:43,690
Yeah, it's probably, yeah, yeah.

5395
02:41:43,870 --> 02:41:44,930
And buttons.

5396
02:41:45,170 --> 02:41:46,030
Yeah, yeah.

5397
02:41:46,550 --> 02:41:46,910
And buttons and right.

5398
02:41:47,010 --> 02:41:47,590
And buttons.

5399
02:41:48,110 --> 02:41:48,510
And buttons.

5400
02:41:49,430 --> 02:41:50,090
I did not...

5401
02:41:50,090 --> 02:41:50,350
I just don't...

5402
02:41:50,350 --> 02:41:52,770
I think, I think the right side's just cursed.

5403
02:41:52,790 --> 02:41:53,210
I think.

5404
02:41:53,590 --> 02:41:54,750
By the way...

5405
02:41:54,750 --> 02:42:01,090
You put the right side and you put the left side.

5406
02:42:01,090 --> 02:42:03,170
But I was like no, I tried it once, I'm good, now.

5407
02:42:03,370 --> 02:42:03,770
Okay.

5408
02:42:03,770 --> 02:42:04,390
When you get it, I'm gonna let you get it.

5409
02:42:04,390 --> 02:42:04,950
Don't rush to the door.

5410
02:42:05,210 --> 02:42:07,030
Don't rush to the door so quickly.

5411
02:42:07,130 --> 02:42:08,090
I think that'll pull up the people.

5412
02:42:08,110 --> 02:42:08,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5413
02:42:09,470 --> 02:42:12,170
As the middle, I just wait for the ends to go up.

5414
02:42:12,170 --> 02:42:15,130
I don't know if it's better to pull them, but I just kind of like sit down.

5415
02:42:15,530 --> 02:42:17,250
No, don't pull the ends to pull.

5416
02:42:17,870 --> 02:42:18,810
I just do this.

5417
02:42:18,850 --> 02:42:19,530
I just inch up.

5418
02:42:20,350 --> 02:42:22,530
Yeah, if you're in the middle, take your time.

5419
02:42:23,870 --> 02:42:25,490
Must be nice to have that privilege.

5420
02:42:25,710 --> 02:42:26,390
Yeah, right?

5421
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:28,330
No!

5422
02:42:29,050 --> 02:42:29,570
Noooooo!

5423
02:42:30,170 --> 02:42:30,690
Noooooooo!

5424
02:42:31,650 --> 02:42:32,170
Hmm.

5425
02:42:32,730 --> 02:42:33,390
It's okay.

5426
02:42:33,710 --> 02:42:36,370
If we keep doing it, eventually it'll work.

5427
02:42:36,650 --> 02:42:37,770
I think we need to call out our steps.

5428
02:42:37,990 --> 02:42:38,910
One, two, step.

5429
02:42:39,090 --> 02:42:39,630
Three, two.

5430
02:42:39,650 --> 02:42:40,290
It's like rotating.

5431
02:42:40,470 --> 02:42:42,110
We're gonna be a row team, guys.

5432
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:43,430
we're gonna be a row team, guys.

5433
02:42:43,570 --> 02:42:43,610
Row.

5434
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:44,050
Row.

5435
02:42:46,390 --> 02:42:46,910
Row.

5436
02:42:47,490 --> 02:42:48,010
Row.

5437
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:48,790
Row.

5438
02:42:49,010 --> 02:42:49,530
Row.

5439
02:42:49,670 --> 02:42:50,190
Row.

5440
02:42:50,630 --> 02:42:50,930
Row.

5441
02:42:52,190 --> 02:42:52,710
Row.

5442
02:42:55,250 --> 02:42:55,770
Sink.

5443
02:42:55,770 --> 02:42:56,090
Sink.

5444
02:42:56,090 --> 02:42:56,730
Everybody sink.

5445
02:42:57,650 --> 02:42:58,310
Get into your row computer.

5446
02:42:58,310 --> 02:42:59,170
Doki, you're too far.

5447
02:42:59,210 --> 02:42:59,730
There we go.

5448
02:42:59,850 --> 02:43:00,830
Okay, and go.

5449
02:43:01,410 --> 02:43:01,890
Go!

5450
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:02,550
Go!

5451
02:43:04,810 --> 02:43:05,970
I did it!

5452
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:07,650
I did it!

5453
02:43:07,870 --> 02:43:09,150
You did it, Doki!

5454
02:43:09,690 --> 02:43:11,010
I did it!

5455
02:43:13,210 --> 02:43:14,610
I made it across!

5456
02:43:15,070 --> 02:43:17,130
This is the worst game ever made.

5457
02:43:19,830 --> 02:43:22,130
Alright, wait for everybody and off we go.

5458
02:43:22,210 --> 02:43:24,290
Girls, let's do it again one more time.

5459
02:43:24,410 --> 02:43:24,550
No, girls!

5460
02:43:24,790 --> 02:43:25,330
No, girls!

5461
02:43:25,330 --> 02:43:26,930
Don't forget those smiles!

5462
02:43:27,290 --> 02:43:30,850
And up, up, and hit that button, hit that button!

5463
02:43:30,850 --> 02:43:34,950
And one, and two, and three, and four!

5464
02:43:36,650 --> 02:43:40,370
I'm gonna go fuck the lawn washers in 30 minutes!

5465
02:43:42,090 --> 02:43:43,110
Don't forget the smile!

5466
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:48,650
If you are finding yourself pulling ahead, fall back, keep an eye on the rope in general, that's very good.

5467
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:55,110
And to the left, and then you go up, and you go up, and up, and up, and up, and you hit that button!

5468
02:43:55,330 --> 02:43:58,770
And then you move right, and then you go and forward!

5469
02:43:59,190 --> 02:43:59,710
Forward!

5470
02:44:00,090 --> 02:44:01,870
Big smiles everybody, big smiles!

5471
02:44:02,270 --> 02:44:02,910
Big smiles!

5472
02:44:03,390 --> 02:44:04,270
Don't go to the door!

5473
02:44:06,910 --> 02:44:08,390
We got two!

5474
02:44:08,510 --> 02:44:10,270
Big smile, big smile!

5475
02:44:10,890 --> 02:44:11,970
Not yet!

5476
02:44:13,090 --> 02:44:15,990
I'm doing television aerobics!

5477
02:44:17,350 --> 02:44:19,430
We're back to the 80s!

5478
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:22,570
And one, and two, and stretch!

5479
02:44:23,010 --> 02:44:25,050
Right for the sky!

5480
02:44:25,330 --> 02:44:27,230
We're back to the 80s, guys!

5481
02:44:27,710 --> 02:44:28,790
We need aerobics tape to get us through!

5482
02:44:31,650 --> 02:44:33,310
Okay, what's this?

5483
02:44:33,450 --> 02:44:34,570
What the fuck is this?

5484
02:44:35,310 --> 02:44:35,790
Speedrun!

5485
02:44:37,010 --> 02:44:38,590
You have to be between...

5486
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:40,110
In between?

5487
02:44:41,090 --> 02:44:42,270
Yeah, greater than...

5488
02:44:42,270 --> 02:44:44,690
So don't press the buttons yet!

5489
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:47,090
Less than two seconds, or almost three, I guess.

5490
02:44:47,530 --> 02:44:48,450
Where the fuck am I?

5491
02:44:49,110 --> 02:44:49,590
Go!

5492
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:51,150
Press, press, press, press, press!

5493
02:44:51,630 --> 02:44:52,110
Stuffy!

5494
02:44:52,250 --> 02:44:52,630
Stuffy!

5495
02:44:52,890 --> 02:44:53,270
Stuffy!

5496
02:44:53,550 --> 02:44:54,350
Stuffy's AFK!

5497
02:44:55,330 --> 02:44:57,330
Oh, I was looking at the wrong guy!

5498
02:44:57,530 --> 02:44:58,810
I'm like, wait, I already hit it!

5499
02:44:59,530 --> 02:44:59,970
Yeah!

5500
02:45:02,970 --> 02:45:03,410
And...

5501
02:45:03,910 --> 02:45:04,350
Oh!

5502
02:45:04,350 --> 02:45:04,790
Oh!

5503
02:45:05,010 --> 02:45:05,430
Wow!

5504
02:45:05,890 --> 02:45:08,750
Wow, okay.

5505
02:45:08,970 --> 02:45:10,350
We gotta be right on top of it.

5506
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:12,190
Oh my god.

5507
02:45:12,310 --> 02:45:13,750
Oh, it changes!

5508
02:45:14,130 --> 02:45:14,910
Wait, no, it doesn't change.

5509
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:15,410
No, it doesn't.

5510
02:45:15,410 --> 02:45:16,650
No, we're just too slow.

5511
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:20,170
No, it doesn't.

5512
02:45:20,170 --> 02:45:20,170
No, we're just too slow.

5513
02:45:20,170 --> 02:45:21,630
No, it doesn't.

5514
02:45:21,710 --> 02:45:21,870
No, it doesn't.

5515
02:45:21,870 --> 02:45:22,350
No, we're just too slow.

5516
02:45:22,350 --> 02:45:23,210
It's our total!

5517
02:45:23,870 --> 02:45:24,830
It's our total.

5518
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:27,510
So just like, run on top of it.

5519
02:45:28,530 --> 02:45:29,010
So just like, run on top of it.

5520
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:29,230
Oh, wait.

5521
02:45:29,410 --> 02:45:30,310
Okay, okay.

5522
02:45:31,070 --> 02:45:32,210
Just run on top.

5523
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:33,870
Alright, once it starts.

5524
02:45:34,170 --> 02:45:35,410
And... go.

5525
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:37,950
Oh my god!

5526
02:45:38,050 --> 02:45:39,010
This is actually awful.

5527
02:45:40,850 --> 02:45:41,330
Okay.

5528
02:45:42,970 --> 02:45:43,830
Oh my god.

5529
02:45:43,890 --> 02:45:46,110
Oh my god, we have to be like, up to it.

5530
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:46,830
I wish I had a countdown.

5531
02:45:47,270 --> 02:45:49,030
We have to all be like around 30.

5532
02:45:49,030 --> 02:45:50,290
Oh, I'm sorry.

5533
02:45:55,070 --> 02:45:56,850
We're too close.

5534
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:57,150
Oh, fuck.

5535
02:45:57,230 --> 02:45:57,490
Sorry.

5536
02:45:58,410 --> 02:45:59,390
Oh, oh.

5537
02:45:59,470 --> 02:46:00,550
Oh, shit.

5538
02:46:01,730 --> 02:46:02,330
What?

5539
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:04,430
What?

5540
02:46:04,430 --> 02:46:04,810
Go!

5541
02:46:05,110 --> 02:46:05,270
Go!

5542
02:46:05,270 --> 02:46:06,950
Why was I waiting so long?

5543
02:46:06,970 --> 02:46:08,650
We were so close!

5544
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:10,250
We were so close.

5545
02:46:10,390 --> 02:46:11,850
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

5546
02:46:12,990 --> 02:46:13,590
What?

5547
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:14,930
What?

5548
02:46:15,770 --> 02:46:17,690
The timer has to start going.

5549
02:46:19,430 --> 02:46:21,950
We have to be like, let's like, scoot up to it.

5550
02:46:22,010 --> 02:46:22,910
Scoot up to it, too.

5551
02:46:23,170 --> 02:46:23,430
Yeah.

5552
02:46:26,690 --> 02:46:27,490
I'm gonna go.

5553
02:46:27,690 --> 02:46:28,650
Oh, I'm saying I'm...

5554
02:46:28,650 --> 02:46:28,950
Yeah!

5555
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:33,120
Link, I was like, staring at you.

5556
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:33,640
I know.

5557
02:46:33,940 --> 02:46:34,400
Me too!

5558
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:37,940
You guys are our drivers, jeez.

5559
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:39,520
Literally not even blinking.

5560
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:40,560
Not even breathing.

5561
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:41,320
No.

5562
02:46:42,220 --> 02:46:43,740
Not even breathing.

5563
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:44,200
Ready.

5564
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:45,720
Steady.

5565
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:46,660
Number two.

5566
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,660
All I learned is Pico Park and breathing.

5567
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:49,760
What's this?

5568
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:51,040
Wait, what's this?

5569
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:51,740
I don't know.

5570
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:54,640
Oh, I think the, the, it's gonna like, rock it.

5571
02:46:54,740 --> 02:46:54,900
Yeah.

5572
02:46:56,320 --> 02:46:57,820
Oh, we have to time it correctly.

5573
02:46:58,060 --> 02:47:00,000
Okay, so like, you have to hit the block.

5574
02:47:00,260 --> 02:47:01,300
Oh, I see, I see.

5575
02:47:01,300 --> 02:47:01,760
So like...

5576
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:02,700
Okay, hold on.

5577
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:03,200
Wait, wait, wait.

5578
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:03,860
Oh, sorry.

5579
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:04,820
I'm trying to move.

5580
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:05,380
Ready?

5581
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:07,560
Three, two, one.

5582
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:09,180
Oh.

5583
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:10,420
Oh, it's a little too early.

5584
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:11,020
A little too early.

5585
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:11,700
Okay, yeah, yeah.

5586
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:13,380
I'll use the countdown in game.

5587
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:13,700
Ready?

5588
02:47:14,180 --> 02:47:14,540
Yeah.

5589
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:20,730
So close!

5590
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:22,010
Just push it.

5591
02:47:22,150 --> 02:47:22,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5592
02:47:22,730 --> 02:47:23,290
There we go.

5593
02:47:25,430 --> 02:47:26,230
Give me a sec.

5594
02:47:27,230 --> 02:47:27,910
Alright, I'm ready.

5595
02:47:28,530 --> 02:47:30,830
You need to be, like, up there.

5596
02:47:31,370 --> 02:47:32,150
Yeah, there you go.

5597
02:47:32,910 --> 02:47:34,750
Oh, wait, okay, I didn't realize we were starting.

5598
02:47:34,990 --> 02:47:35,470
Let's try it again.

5599
02:47:35,710 --> 02:47:35,850
Okay.

5600
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:37,790
Two, one.

5601
02:47:39,670 --> 02:47:40,610
Ah, so close!

5602
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:41,450
So close!

5603
02:47:43,070 --> 02:47:43,710
So close.

5604
02:47:44,670 --> 02:47:44,990
Alright.

5605
02:47:46,570 --> 02:47:47,250
Three, two, one.

5606
02:47:47,970 --> 02:47:48,810
How do I get over there?

5607
02:47:48,910 --> 02:47:49,470
Okay, there we go.

5608
02:47:50,730 --> 02:47:50,910
Oh!

5609
02:47:51,390 --> 02:47:51,710
Oh!

5610
02:47:53,430 --> 02:47:56,730
Wait, how do we go?

5611
02:47:56,830 --> 02:47:57,530
How do we even leave it?

5612
02:47:58,430 --> 02:47:58,910
Yay!

5613
02:47:59,590 --> 02:47:59,930
Yay!

5614
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:03,510
The last person needs help.

5615
02:48:03,870 --> 02:48:04,930
We need the block.

5616
02:48:05,210 --> 02:48:07,330
Yeah, we actually do need it.

5617
02:48:07,390 --> 02:48:09,350
We have to do it.

5618
02:48:10,450 --> 02:48:11,170
Wait, what?

5619
02:48:11,970 --> 02:48:13,510
Okay, I'm gonna push it.

5620
02:48:13,590 --> 02:48:14,070
Oh, okay.

5621
02:48:14,250 --> 02:48:14,570
Okay.

5622
02:48:15,430 --> 02:48:16,450
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

5623
02:48:16,630 --> 02:48:18,310
Forget using your brain, Dee.

5624
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:19,950
Just freaking throw your head against the cliff.

5625
02:48:22,290 --> 02:48:24,930
Can you jump on the box for it?

5626
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:26,850
Like, is the box enough?

5627
02:48:27,210 --> 02:48:27,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5628
02:48:28,070 --> 02:48:29,310
No, I think it is.

5629
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:32,390
You just have to fall off and then you can...

5630
02:48:32,390 --> 02:48:33,530
Maybe you have to time it.

5631
02:48:33,790 --> 02:48:39,250
Maybe you two should try the mid-air collision thing and just fall into the...

5632
02:48:39,250 --> 02:48:40,230
Yeah, collide with each other.

5633
02:48:40,370 --> 02:48:40,790
Okay.

5634
02:48:41,950 --> 02:48:42,770
Let's collide.

5635
02:48:44,610 --> 02:48:45,890
Do the countdown.

5636
02:48:46,170 --> 02:48:47,750
You guys are gonna do the countdown, yeah.

5637
02:48:48,270 --> 02:48:48,750
Okay.

5638
02:48:48,970 --> 02:48:50,230
We didn't need that before.

5639
02:48:50,730 --> 02:48:52,690
Three, two, one.

5640
02:48:52,690 --> 02:48:54,270
Wait, my one or your one?

5641
02:48:54,310 --> 02:48:54,670
Oh, sorry.

5642
02:48:57,910 --> 02:48:59,630
Three, two, one.

5643
02:49:00,550 --> 02:49:01,250
Oh, sorry.

5644
02:49:02,730 --> 02:49:03,530
No way.

5645
02:49:03,810 --> 02:49:04,190
Okay, okay.

5646
02:49:04,450 --> 02:49:07,330
Three, two, one.

5647
02:49:07,850 --> 02:49:09,450
Oh, no!

5648
02:49:09,810 --> 02:49:10,990
No, you're good for me.

5649
02:49:11,030 --> 02:49:13,170
I'm trying.

5650
02:49:13,710 --> 02:49:14,770
I'm trying.

5651
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:16,010
I'm trying.

5652
02:49:17,110 --> 02:49:17,710
Okay.

5653
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:21,550
Three, two, one.

5654
02:49:21,650 --> 02:49:22,090
Stop!

5655
02:49:23,870 --> 02:49:24,430
Nailed it.

5656
02:49:26,370 --> 02:49:28,070
Wait, maybe I can like...

5657
02:49:28,830 --> 02:49:30,270
Maybe jump across it.

5658
02:49:30,590 --> 02:49:30,990
Jump across it.

5659
02:49:33,210 --> 02:49:33,870
I'll come out.

5660
02:49:34,570 --> 02:49:35,390
It's not gonna work.

5661
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:36,350
It's not gonna work here.

5662
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:37,730
What am I...

5663
02:49:37,730 --> 02:49:39,090
Alright, okay, okay.

5664
02:49:39,950 --> 02:49:40,950
Sorry, sorry.

5665
02:49:42,330 --> 02:49:43,310
Three... Oh, fuck.

5666
02:49:43,390 --> 02:49:43,990
Okay, I'm sorry.

5667
02:49:44,370 --> 02:49:45,070
Timer in game.

5668
02:49:45,610 --> 02:49:46,210
Yeah, true.

5669
02:49:46,490 --> 02:49:47,150
Timer in game.

5670
02:49:48,270 --> 02:49:50,070
Three, two, one.

5671
02:49:50,730 --> 02:49:50,930
Go.

5672
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:58,940
You can hear the keyboard.

5673
02:49:59,180 --> 02:50:02,080
You can hear the button mashed in.

5674
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:05,000
Oh, my God.

5675
02:50:05,220 --> 02:50:06,620
It grows longer.

5676
02:50:06,860 --> 02:50:07,160
What?

5677
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:10,260
Ew.

5678
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:12,600
What the hell are we?

5679
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:15,240
Oh, we have to get the baseball.

5680
02:50:15,380 --> 02:50:17,140
We have to get the baseball and bounce it to the cross.

5681
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:20,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5682
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:21,100
Christ.

5683
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:22,960
What the fuck?

5684
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:24,500
You have to be shorter.

5685
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:25,720
Your ears have to be a little shorter.

5686
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:27,920
I think you have to start...

5687
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:30,300
Do you have to start short so it can bounce all the way up?

5688
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:31,100
Maybe.

5689
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:31,940
I don't know.

5690
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:32,320
Oh!

5691
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:35,440
If you start short, I think it bounces harder.

5692
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:38,100
Okay.

5693
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:39,260
I give up.

5694
02:50:43,300 --> 02:50:44,280
Wait, wait, wait.

5695
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:45,600
Grow.

5696
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:46,920
Grow as it hits you.

5697
02:50:47,460 --> 02:50:52,320
Or maybe we should make like a ladder up to it and catch it from there so that it doesn't bounce as hard.

5698
02:50:53,180 --> 02:50:55,700
Maybe we should go all the way back up to the top.

5699
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:56,040
Oh, you jump.

5700
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:57,280
You jump as it hits you.

5701
02:50:57,540 --> 02:50:58,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5702
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:00,340
Oh, okay.

5703
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:01,360
I got it.

5704
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:03,640
Oh, maybe not too...

5705
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:05,180
There we go.

5706
02:51:05,300 --> 02:51:06,000
Yeah, we have to jump.

5707
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:06,440
We have to jump.

5708
02:51:06,440 --> 02:51:07,920
Okay, so move up, move up, move up more.

5709
02:51:08,180 --> 02:51:09,580
We need to get further.

5710
02:51:11,380 --> 02:51:12,140
Yeah, we need more.

5711
02:51:12,160 --> 02:51:13,700
Why are you taking my spot?

5712
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:14,580
I'm sorry.

5713
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:15,120
I'm sorry.

5714
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:17,000
I'm such a fuck up.

5715
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:17,480
I'm sorry.

5716
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:18,140
Ball guys.

5717
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:23,780
Juni, you should spread out because you're not hitting it.

5718
02:51:23,940 --> 02:51:24,520
You're right.

5719
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:24,800
I know.

5720
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:25,500
I just...

5721
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:26,260
Okay, okay.

5722
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:26,940
Get out of here.

5723
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:27,520
Get out of here.

5724
02:51:27,760 --> 02:51:28,420
Get out.

5725
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:32,280
So we don't capture it?

5726
02:51:32,300 --> 02:51:32,520
There we go.

5727
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:33,980
No, no, no.

5728
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:34,580
You just jumped.

5729
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:36,440
I'm sorry.

5730
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:37,740
I'm sorry.

5731
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:40,600
I'm sorry.

5732
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:41,200
I'm sorry.

5733
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:41,840
I'm sorry.

5734
02:51:41,960 --> 02:51:42,500
I'm sorry.

5735
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:44,360
How do you...

5736
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:44,900
Stop.

5737
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:48,880
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5738
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:49,420
You got it.

5739
02:51:49,420 --> 02:51:49,760
You got it.

5740
02:51:50,280 --> 02:51:53,140
I was hoping it would be all you.

5741
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:54,760
Sorry.

5742
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:55,820
I'm a little flat.

5743
02:51:57,480 --> 02:51:57,960
Oops.

5744
02:51:58,360 --> 02:51:58,980
Okay, guys.

5745
02:51:59,060 --> 02:52:00,140
We can figure this out.

5746
02:52:00,880 --> 02:52:03,300
Bao and I got the system in.

5747
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:04,620
Okay.

5748
02:52:05,560 --> 02:52:06,820
Yeah, you don't even move.

5749
02:52:07,320 --> 02:52:09,200
We're still figuring out our area.

5750
02:52:11,500 --> 02:52:12,760
I pressed up.

5751
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:13,960
I pressed up, but it didn't work.

5752
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:15,040
Oh.

5753
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:16,860
Maybe I need to go shorter.

5754
02:52:19,140 --> 02:52:20,640
Guys, we need that momentum.

5755
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:22,640
We need that momentum there.

5756
02:52:23,020 --> 02:52:23,400
Someone's not jumping.

5757
02:52:23,540 --> 02:52:25,320
Emily, you gotta jump.

5758
02:52:25,940 --> 02:52:27,260
You gotta jump.

5759
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:29,260
You gotta jump.

5760
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:29,960
You gotta jump.

5761
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,640
I hear no jumping.

5762
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:36,660
Oh, oh, oh.

5763
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:37,180
No!

5764
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:41,300
Oh, wait.

5765
02:52:41,340 --> 02:52:42,920
Who keeps growing higher?

5766
02:52:43,980 --> 02:52:45,100
Stop growing.

5767
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:47,460
I'm just so much bigger.

5768
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:48,960
She's getting excited there.

5769
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:52,640
I'm trying to give you guys some air.

5770
02:52:55,760 --> 02:52:57,080
Bao and I are just...

5771
02:52:57,080 --> 02:52:58,560
We got a system going in.

5772
02:52:58,780 --> 02:52:59,500
I'm just chilling.

5773
02:53:00,180 --> 02:53:01,260
I'm mad chilling.

5774
02:53:01,260 --> 02:53:02,140
We need to get nice and high.

5775
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:03,880
We're so chill now.

5776
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:06,600
No!

5777
02:53:08,460 --> 02:53:09,500
Nice and high.

5778
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:10,200
Nice and high.

5779
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:13,100
Maybe, Juniper, grow your ears a little bit.

5780
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:13,980
Okay, I will.

5781
02:53:13,980 --> 02:53:16,100
Yeah, you gotta be a little bit...

5782
02:53:16,100 --> 02:53:16,360
Oh!

5783
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:16,720
No!

5784
02:53:17,140 --> 02:53:19,300
You need more height when it gets to me.

5785
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:21,120
You need taller.

5786
02:53:21,820 --> 02:53:23,060
Yeah, more high.

5787
02:53:24,580 --> 02:53:25,480
Oh, so close!

5788
02:53:25,880 --> 02:53:27,200
Okay, maybe a little taller?

5789
02:53:27,700 --> 02:53:28,420
Yes, taller.

5790
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:29,960
This is so fun.

5791
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:33,000
We look like a xylophone.

5792
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:37,820
Okay, that's a little too tall, yeah.

5793
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:39,580
Yeah, I know.

5794
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:43,460
Oh, no!

5795
02:53:43,740 --> 02:53:44,180
Oh!

5796
02:53:46,340 --> 02:53:47,020
Oh!

5797
02:53:48,180 --> 02:53:49,080
I'm gonna go crazy.

5798
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:53,440
Oh, I'm gonna go fucking bananas!

5799
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:56,540
Oh, sorry.

5800
02:53:56,820 --> 02:53:57,820
I tried jumping.

5801
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:01,860
We probably need to get, like, progressively higher.

5802
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:03,300
So...

5803
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:06,260
If you're smaller than the one on your right...

5804
02:54:06,260 --> 02:54:07,860
I'm getting highway hypnosis.

5805
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:10,980
I'm as tall as I can go.

5806
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:12,960
What's highway hypnosis?

5807
02:54:13,380 --> 02:54:14,040
Oh!

5808
02:54:14,360 --> 02:54:14,680
No!

5809
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:15,220
No!

5810
02:54:15,440 --> 02:54:16,960
Where did we get it?

5811
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:19,400
Oh, get off the person's head, yeah.

5812
02:54:19,620 --> 02:54:20,640
Grow on the head.

5813
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:22,140
There you go.

5814
02:54:22,220 --> 02:54:22,660
Grow me.

5815
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:24,060
Grow on the head.

5816
02:54:24,220 --> 02:54:25,380
Grow on the head.

5817
02:54:28,440 --> 02:54:29,620
Dude, where are we?

5818
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:31,180
You must answer my riddles.

5819
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:34,480
I am the troll.

5820
02:54:35,400 --> 02:54:36,320
Under the bridge.

5821
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:38,100
You must be the troll.

5822
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:39,900
Okay, stop trying to take my key, Dokie.

5823
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:40,760
Stop trying to take my keys.

5824
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:41,840
I'm literally just standing there!

5825
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:42,300
Boo!

5826
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:43,100
Boo!

5827
02:54:43,160 --> 02:54:44,500
Hey, the troll tall.

5828
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:49,500
I'm putting it up here so you can't grab it, okay?

5829
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:50,640
There we go.

5830
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:55,540
Nice.

5831
02:54:55,640 --> 02:54:56,260
We did it.

5832
02:54:56,300 --> 02:54:57,020
We did it, guys.

5833
02:54:58,140 --> 02:54:58,580
Yay!

5834
02:54:58,740 --> 02:54:59,900
That was a fun mechanic.

5835
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:02,680
Yeah, that was a crazy mechanic there.

5836
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:04,200
What are we?

5837
02:55:05,180 --> 02:55:06,100
We're just Pico.

5838
02:55:06,180 --> 02:55:06,880
We're Picos.

5839
02:55:07,020 --> 02:55:08,220
We're Picos in a park.

5840
02:55:09,060 --> 02:55:09,780
Pico Park!

5841
02:55:12,060 --> 02:55:12,520
What?

5842
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:14,280
What did you do?

5843
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:16,820
All I did was jump!

5844
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,680
Okay, so don't jump.

5845
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:19,200
Don't jump.

5846
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:21,360
Oh, until we get there.

5847
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:22,200
Yeah, yeah.

5848
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:24,880
Alright, guys.

5849
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:26,540
Okay.

5850
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:28,400
Okay.

5851
02:55:29,540 --> 02:55:30,780
Alright, no, I got it.

5852
02:55:31,700 --> 02:55:32,300
Don't jump.

5853
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:33,880
Don't jump.

5854
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:34,960
Oh, sorry.

5855
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:37,540
What was that?

5856
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:38,840
Don't jump.

5857
02:55:39,820 --> 02:55:42,400
Can you, like, suspend yourself by, like, spamming jump?

5858
02:55:43,020 --> 02:55:43,800
Probably not.

5859
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:44,860
Probably not, no.

5860
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:46,500
Yeah, you have to touch it first.

5861
02:55:48,420 --> 02:55:50,100
Wait, is there enough room?

5862
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:50,840
Okay, there's enough room.

5863
02:55:51,220 --> 02:55:52,200
Yeah, you gotta...

5864
02:55:56,180 --> 02:55:57,460
What do we do here?

5865
02:55:58,220 --> 02:55:59,780
Oh, we have to land on each other!

5866
02:55:59,880 --> 02:56:00,720
On each other's heads!

5867
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:02,380
Do we?

5868
02:56:02,480 --> 02:56:02,700
Yeah!

5869
02:56:04,120 --> 02:56:05,740
Wait, what?

5870
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:07,820
I think we land on each other's heads.

5871
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:08,060
On each other's heads?

5872
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:09,960
Yeah, yeah, we can build a ladder, try it.

5873
02:56:10,720 --> 02:56:11,580
Like back here?

5874
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:12,900
Yeah, try jump up.

5875
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:15,960
Yeah, yeah, and then jump down into the person's heads.

5876
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:16,420
Yeah, see?

5877
02:56:17,840 --> 02:56:18,240
Okay.

5878
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:20,680
Yeah, and then...

5879
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:23,520
Come up here.

5880
02:56:23,780 --> 02:56:25,860
And then we all jump down to you, guys.

5881
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:29,440
I don't think that's how that's gonna work.

5882
02:56:29,580 --> 02:56:30,380
No, trust me!

5883
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:33,520
I don't know about that one.

5884
02:56:33,700 --> 02:56:34,320
I don't know about that one.

5885
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:36,240
No, no, it works!

5886
02:56:36,280 --> 02:56:37,220
Cause then we build a ladder!

5887
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:39,240
You can't jump though, right?

5888
02:56:39,540 --> 02:56:41,400
Yeah, you can't jump if someone's on your head.

5889
02:56:41,540 --> 02:56:42,840
So how are we gonna go the other way?

5890
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:47,380
The other person that makes it at the top will be a ladder.

5891
02:56:47,560 --> 02:56:49,000
And then they'll be closer to the...

5892
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:49,780
It's the ladder system!

5893
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:50,820
We can just do that.

5894
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:53,040
We can just start it from the bottom though.

5895
02:56:54,060 --> 02:56:54,780
Yeah, like that!

5896
02:56:56,100 --> 02:56:57,580
No, we don't do that here.

5897
02:56:57,640 --> 02:56:58,280
We can just start like that.

5898
02:57:00,540 --> 02:57:03,040
But we can start it like this way.

5899
02:57:03,140 --> 02:57:04,080
So we don't have to do it upside down.

5900
02:57:04,320 --> 02:57:04,540
We can just drop.

5901
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:06,680
Go to the right normally.

5902
02:57:08,660 --> 02:57:09,700
And then ladder!

5903
02:57:09,920 --> 02:57:10,980
Okay, now we stack.

5904
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:12,400
Now we're stacking.

5905
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:13,080
Stack!

5906
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:17,320
And then you jump down?

5907
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:19,600
You guys need to drop like a bat.

5908
02:57:21,220 --> 02:57:23,060
A family of opossums.

5909
02:57:23,420 --> 02:57:24,460
Oh, okay.

5910
02:57:24,580 --> 02:57:24,960
That was weird.

5911
02:57:25,240 --> 02:57:28,760
I need space to...

5912
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:29,560
Okay, there you go.

5913
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:31,480
You can space it down.

5914
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:33,000
And then we ladder.

5915
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:35,340
Everybody move to the right.

5916
02:57:35,360 --> 02:57:36,060
Stretch a little bit.

5917
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:36,780
Very careful.

5918
02:57:36,920 --> 02:57:37,900
It's not enough.

5919
02:57:39,940 --> 02:57:40,440
It's not enough.

5920
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:42,600
Trust me!

5921
02:57:42,640 --> 02:57:43,480
Trust the process!

5922
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:45,900
It is enough!

5923
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:47,980
We just need shimmy a little bit more.

5924
02:57:47,980 --> 02:57:50,960
Do we have to jump at an angle?

5925
02:57:51,280 --> 02:57:52,400
Oh no, you can't.

5926
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:53,440
You can't, yeah.

5927
02:57:53,860 --> 02:57:56,520
No, we just need to all shimmy just a little bit.

5928
02:57:56,620 --> 02:57:57,780
If it works, trust the process.

5929
02:57:57,900 --> 02:57:59,800
You cannot move when you're jumping though.

5930
02:57:59,860 --> 02:58:01,340
Yeah, you can't move when you're jumping.

5931
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:05,200
We all just need to shimmy a little bit more.

5932
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:06,260
We didn't trust her, bros.

5933
02:58:06,260 --> 02:58:07,440
Trust the process!

5934
02:58:08,620 --> 02:58:09,220
Spieve.

5935
02:58:09,340 --> 02:58:10,820
Nobody even tried it!

5936
02:58:11,900 --> 02:58:13,100
We did try!

5937
02:58:13,700 --> 02:58:14,440
We did!

5938
02:58:14,640 --> 02:58:16,120
We just fell to our death on accident.

5939
02:58:16,480 --> 02:58:17,860
Oh my god.

5940
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:21,100
Dude, my ping was like 130 right there.

5941
02:58:23,420 --> 02:58:24,020
Okay.

5942
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:26,260
Dude, I'm lagging actually though.

5943
02:58:26,400 --> 02:58:27,460
Like, my stream is dying.

5944
02:58:27,460 --> 02:58:28,280
I'm lagging.

5945
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:28,580
I'm lagging.

5946
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:32,720
I've lost the plot, fellas.

5947
02:58:33,020 --> 02:58:34,320
Oh, um...

5948
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:35,980
Stacking.

5949
02:58:36,380 --> 02:58:38,260
Did you disconnect?

5950
02:58:39,320 --> 02:58:39,960
Did you disconnect?

5951
02:58:41,460 --> 02:58:42,960
Oh, you said thank you.

5952
02:58:43,380 --> 02:58:43,880
I'm going through.

5953
02:58:44,680 --> 02:58:46,480
No, we don't stack yet.

5954
02:58:46,500 --> 02:58:47,940
We stack after...

5955
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:48,760
I can't go down.

5956
02:58:50,240 --> 02:58:52,600
Juniper go down, then Amelie on top.

5957
02:58:52,660 --> 02:58:54,120
On top of each other.

5958
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:55,280
You're right, you're right.

5959
02:58:57,460 --> 02:58:59,440
Okay, and then...

5960
02:58:59,440 --> 02:58:59,840
Go down.

5961
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:02,660
And then bow.

5962
02:59:03,280 --> 02:59:04,120
And then me.

5963
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:05,360
And then Doki.

5964
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:08,000
And then we just...

5965
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,960
Right, as much as you possibly can.

5966
02:59:11,620 --> 02:59:12,100
Everyone...

5967
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:15,320
Take us back, take us back, take us back!

5968
02:59:15,800 --> 02:59:17,400
As far as I can go.

5969
02:59:17,860 --> 02:59:18,340
Great.

5970
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:19,380
Here we go.

5971
02:59:20,200 --> 02:59:22,300
Just don't fall, just trust the process.

5972
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:24,140
Just trust the process.

5973
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:26,200
I'm holding on with my pinky toe here.

5974
02:59:27,460 --> 02:59:28,300
Just go over a little bit, yeah.

5975
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,720
You need me to go a little further.

5976
02:59:30,740 --> 02:59:32,580
I need, I need Steffi Higo a little bit.

5977
02:59:32,740 --> 02:59:34,000
Look at me on Juniper's head.

5978
02:59:34,500 --> 02:59:36,840
Okay, wait, what?

5979
02:59:38,200 --> 02:59:38,600
Yes!

5980
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:41,200
The process has been trusted!

5981
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:42,560
Yes!

5982
02:59:42,900 --> 02:59:43,300
Yes!

5983
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:47,180
Now we all need to be on this.

5984
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:49,400
We all trusted the process.

5985
02:59:49,720 --> 02:59:50,940
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

5986
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:51,420
All but one.

5987
02:59:53,240 --> 02:59:53,640
Guys...

5988
02:59:54,200 --> 02:59:56,020
Okay, good job.

5989
02:59:57,460 --> 02:59:57,880
Wait, no!

5990
02:59:58,040 --> 02:59:58,380
No!

5991
03:00:00,700 --> 03:00:01,900
Oh no!

5992
03:00:02,660 --> 03:00:03,520
Small panic.

5993
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:08,900
Everybody started panicking and then I started panicking!

5994
03:00:09,480 --> 03:00:10,940
I thought we were gonna jump off.

5995
03:00:10,940 --> 03:00:11,900
There were spikes coming.

5996
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:13,040
Okay.

5997
03:00:14,380 --> 03:00:16,000
Even got the button.

5998
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:24,380
Okay, on top of each other, one by one.

5999
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:26,100
One by one.

6000
03:00:27,460 --> 03:00:28,240
One by one.

6001
03:00:32,020 --> 03:00:33,020
Okay, back.

6002
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:34,980
Here we go again.

6003
03:00:36,340 --> 03:00:36,840
Back.

6004
03:00:40,300 --> 03:00:41,420
Back at it again.

6005
03:00:41,500 --> 03:00:42,740
Gotta wait until you're on solid.

6006
03:00:45,220 --> 03:00:45,720
Toki?

6007
03:00:45,820 --> 03:00:46,400
I'm losing my mind.

6008
03:00:46,660 --> 03:00:47,540
That was all me, baby.

6009
03:00:47,820 --> 03:00:48,940
It didn't even matter.

6010
03:00:51,380 --> 03:00:53,700
You just got picked up by an alien tractor beam.

6011
03:00:53,980 --> 03:00:54,880
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

6012
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:10,460
It's a small world music, kind of, which is why we're doing this.

6013
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:11,360
Six!

6014
03:01:11,840 --> 03:01:12,980
I want Rainbow Water!

6015
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:13,560
All right.

6016
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:15,120
All right.

6017
03:01:16,040 --> 03:01:16,840
Ladder time.

6018
03:01:17,580 --> 03:01:19,960
I'm a formation.

6019
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:22,140
Are you good?

6020
03:01:22,380 --> 03:01:23,300
I think you're good.

6021
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:23,980
Go get me.

6022
03:01:23,980 --> 03:01:24,200
I'm good.

6023
03:01:24,200 --> 03:01:24,520
I'm good.

6024
03:01:24,520 --> 03:01:24,620
I'm good.

6025
03:01:24,620 --> 03:01:25,520
Oh my god, that's literally one pixel.

6026
03:01:27,460 --> 03:01:29,220
Oh, she needs to move over?

6027
03:01:29,780 --> 03:01:30,420
There we go.

6028
03:01:30,760 --> 03:01:32,160
Easy peasy, tons of room.

6029
03:01:32,340 --> 03:01:32,820
All right, don't move.

6030
03:01:33,020 --> 03:01:33,640
Don't move?

6031
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:34,580
Don't move?

6032
03:01:35,160 --> 03:01:35,560
Okay.

6033
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:35,880
Okay.

6034
03:01:36,360 --> 03:01:36,760
Yay!

6035
03:01:39,500 --> 03:01:40,840
This one I'm scared.

6036
03:01:42,380 --> 03:01:45,860
I'm going to sit on this side, so I can jump off and hit the button.

6037
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:46,240
Yeah, yeah.

6038
03:01:46,500 --> 03:01:46,900
Okay.

6039
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:49,200
But I may die to ping.

6040
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:49,900
Oh, wait!

6041
03:01:49,980 --> 03:01:51,440
Oh, you're gonna go...

6042
03:01:51,440 --> 03:01:51,740
Okay.

6043
03:01:52,900 --> 03:01:53,300
Bye!

6044
03:01:53,580 --> 03:01:53,940
Oh, Sophie!

6045
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:54,600
Bye!

6046
03:01:58,480 --> 03:02:01,500
You might actually have to do that because of the spikes.

6047
03:02:01,860 --> 03:02:02,880
But where do we go?

6048
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:04,240
Wait, wait, wait.

6049
03:02:04,440 --> 03:02:06,080
We're stuck now.

6050
03:02:06,120 --> 03:02:06,740
Wait, come back, Sophie.

6051
03:02:07,740 --> 03:02:08,820
Wait, let me come back.

6052
03:02:09,720 --> 03:02:10,480
Just jump off.

6053
03:02:10,480 --> 03:02:11,100
Does that not count?

6054
03:02:11,880 --> 03:02:12,640
Okay, there we go.

6055
03:02:12,760 --> 03:02:16,140
Wait, why would they put this platform right below you guys if we weren't supposed to touch that?

6056
03:02:16,720 --> 03:02:17,440
I don't know.

6057
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:19,300
Maybe a safety measure.

6058
03:02:19,560 --> 03:02:21,420
But we can't move anymore.

6059
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:21,800
Too many people died.

6060
03:02:23,060 --> 03:02:24,380
Too many people left.

6061
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:29,920
There has to be a solution.

6062
03:02:29,940 --> 03:02:31,220
Do the jump, it'll be so funny.

6063
03:02:31,860 --> 03:02:33,660
I think we softlocked.

6064
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:37,780
The solution is not to jump on my head when we are going across, I guess.

6065
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:39,660
Yeah, don't jump off.

6066
03:02:39,980 --> 03:02:41,360
Yeah, only one person jump.

6067
03:02:41,580 --> 03:02:42,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6068
03:02:45,580 --> 03:02:47,420
It's okay, we love this level.

6069
03:02:47,740 --> 03:02:51,400
Let limes be at the edge.

6070
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:52,660
And no one stack on her.

6071
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:53,560
Yeah, yeah.

6072
03:02:58,260 --> 03:02:59,120
Voltron form!

6073
03:03:02,520 --> 03:03:03,860
I need, I need...

6074
03:03:03,860 --> 03:03:05,060
Yeah, don't stack yet.

6075
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:05,760
Okay, there we go.

6076
03:03:07,880 --> 03:03:08,360
Alright.

6077
03:03:12,120 --> 03:03:12,880
Trust it.

6078
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:13,440
I think you're good.

6079
03:03:17,660 --> 03:03:19,440
I might have been good.

6080
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:20,880
I might have been good.

6081
03:03:22,460 --> 03:03:23,060
Oops, sorry.

6082
03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:24,660
It's okay, we try again.

6083
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:26,060
We, we do.

6084
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:26,860
We try.

6085
03:03:26,980 --> 03:03:27,340
No, no, no, no.

6086
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:28,600
We are in contact with you.

6087
03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:29,500
Um.

6088
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:30,580
Up.

6089
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:30,980
Ah.

6090
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:31,700
No.

6091
03:03:33,020 --> 03:03:34,240
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6092
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:34,840
Go back, go back.

6093
03:03:34,940 --> 03:03:35,680
Oh, shi- Oh, no.

6094
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:36,460
Oh, I guess we're not.

6095
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:39,300
Oh, no.

6096
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:43,060
Yeah,

6097
03:03:47,180 --> 03:03:47,840
sorry, sorry.

6098
03:03:47,940 --> 03:03:48,260
Like...

6099
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:51,300
I think we're not here anymore.

6100
03:03:51,340 --> 03:03:51,380
Oh, yeah.

6101
03:03:51,380 --> 03:03:51,400
I don't think so.

6102
03:03:51,400 --> 03:03:53,440
Where no one is there, but it's just...

6103
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:56,580
We gotta lock it, guys!

6104
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:57,700
We gotta lock it!

6105
03:03:57,920 --> 03:04:01,360
We literally just had to...

6106
03:04:01,900 --> 03:04:02,340
Okay.

6107
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:04,160
Everything is fine.

6108
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:10,600
Okay, get to the end before we start staggering, because otherwise lag shit fucks up.

6109
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:12,800
Alright, I'm at the end.

6110
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:16,180
Alright, there you go.

6111
03:04:16,260 --> 03:04:17,180
Okay, I think you're good now.

6112
03:04:17,180 --> 03:04:17,580
That's fine, that's good.

6113
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:19,480
Trust the process, there we go.

6114
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:19,700
Yeah, yeah.

6115
03:04:20,080 --> 03:04:21,880
It gives you a little bit of a wiggle room.

6116
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:22,700
Okay.

6117
03:04:25,180 --> 03:04:25,580
Yay!

6118
03:04:26,460 --> 03:04:31,060
Everyone get near me so that we don't accidentally lose anyone.

6119
03:04:31,600 --> 03:04:32,180
Okay, ready?

6120
03:04:32,280 --> 03:04:33,920
It's gonna have to be Juniper that jumps off now.

6121
03:04:33,940 --> 03:04:35,200
Yeah, Juniper, I believe in you.

6122
03:04:35,600 --> 03:04:37,140
Okay, I can do it.

6123
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:39,220
I can do it.

6124
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:42,600
I mean, we could drop in a way that makes slime.

6125
03:04:43,060 --> 03:04:44,540
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6126
03:04:44,740 --> 03:04:45,300
Don't worry.

6127
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:46,020
Okay.

6128
03:04:46,360 --> 03:04:47,040
I can handle this.

6129
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:47,840
I'm worried, I'm worried, I'm worried.

6130
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:51,180
You guys all just need to...

6131
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:51,340
Wait.

6132
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:51,660
Oh.

6133
03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:52,460
Wait.

6134
03:04:53,140 --> 03:04:53,580
Okay.

6135
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:54,240
Alright.

6136
03:04:54,440 --> 03:04:55,920
No, like one person can stay there.

6137
03:04:55,940 --> 03:04:57,400
One person can stay there because...

6138
03:04:57,400 --> 03:04:58,600
Yeah, one person can stay.

6139
03:04:58,920 --> 03:05:00,900
Just we need to like coordinate that.

6140
03:05:01,220 --> 03:05:02,740
You know what?

6141
03:05:02,780 --> 03:05:04,280
Since you're gonna jump I will jump too.

6142
03:05:05,140 --> 03:05:05,580
Okay.

6143
03:05:06,280 --> 03:05:06,760
I know.

6144
03:05:08,660 --> 03:05:11,460
Oh, it's right there.

6145
03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:13,120
I know.

6146
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:14,640
I know.

6147
03:05:14,640 --> 03:05:14,880
I know.

6148
03:05:14,880 --> 03:05:16,240
Kiko Park endurance.

6149
03:05:16,240 --> 03:05:17,440
We're so good.

6150
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:19,580
We're so good.

6151
03:05:20,900 --> 03:05:22,860
I love this game.

6152
03:05:24,680 --> 03:05:25,220
Yay!

6153
03:05:25,340 --> 03:05:25,880
Yay!

6154
03:05:31,900 --> 03:05:32,810
Do the jump.

6155
03:05:33,380 --> 03:05:33,940
Do it.

6156
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:34,520
Jump.

6157
03:05:34,660 --> 03:05:35,200
I think you're good.

6158
03:05:35,320 --> 03:05:35,660
I think you're good.

6159
03:05:35,660 --> 03:05:36,080
Jump!

6160
03:05:36,460 --> 03:05:37,600
Okay, you're sure?

6161
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:38,280
Okay.

6162
03:05:38,320 --> 03:05:38,620
Trust.

6163
03:05:39,280 --> 03:05:40,780
It's like very forgiving.

6164
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:42,600
We're just chilling.

6165
03:05:42,760 --> 03:05:45,180
Alright, I'm going to put myself back here so that I can jump.

6166
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:46,000
Yeah, good idea, good idea.

6167
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:48,400
Okay, nice.

6168
03:05:50,060 --> 03:05:50,460
Okay.

6169
03:05:50,620 --> 03:05:51,020
Okay.

6170
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:51,580
And then I'll stay.

6171
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:52,400
I'll stay here.

6172
03:05:52,700 --> 03:05:52,840
Yeah.

6173
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:54,500
I'm just chilling.

6174
03:05:54,780 --> 03:05:55,020
Okay.

6175
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:55,560
Alright.

6176
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:57,280
Three, two, one.

6177
03:05:57,460 --> 03:05:58,220
Okay, careful.

6178
03:05:58,360 --> 03:06:00,200
It's gonna start like as soon as...

6179
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:00,340
Yeah.

6180
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:02,240
Nice.

6181
03:06:02,300 --> 03:06:02,880
Alright, nice.

6182
03:06:03,240 --> 03:06:04,640
Now, don't think we can drop.

6183
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:05,020
Okay.

6184
03:06:05,160 --> 03:06:06,200
And then we can drop?

6185
03:06:06,620 --> 03:06:07,760
Yeah, then we can drop.

6186
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:08,520
Oh, no, no, no.

6187
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:09,380
Don't drop too soon.

6188
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:09,920
Oh.

6189
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:11,920
We have to like...

6190
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:14,340
That was me.

6191
03:06:14,360 --> 03:06:14,780
That was me.

6192
03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:15,760
We have to coordinate.

6193
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:16,920
I forgot.

6194
03:06:17,560 --> 03:06:17,940
You're good.

6195
03:06:19,140 --> 03:06:19,740
It's okay.

6196
03:06:20,340 --> 03:06:21,120
I forgot.

6197
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:24,280
I love this game.

6198
03:06:24,320 --> 03:06:25,160
I love my friends.

6199
03:06:25,360 --> 03:06:26,220
We're doing so good.

6200
03:06:26,860 --> 03:06:28,140
Oh, sorry.

6201
03:06:28,440 --> 03:06:29,500
First try, guys.

6202
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:30,080
First try.

6203
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:31,600
This is the run.

6204
03:06:31,660 --> 03:06:32,480
This is the run.

6205
03:06:33,140 --> 03:06:34,420
This is the run.

6206
03:06:34,640 --> 03:06:36,280
It wasn't that last one.

6207
03:06:36,380 --> 03:06:36,900
It's this one.

6208
03:06:37,360 --> 03:06:39,120
Shake off those...

6209
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:40,600
Come on, we got this.

6210
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:42,060
We are gamers.

6211
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:43,160
We do this every day.

6212
03:06:43,280 --> 03:06:45,320
Don't ladder until everyone on top.

6213
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:47,120
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6214
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:49,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6215
03:06:51,380 --> 03:06:53,700
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

6216
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:54,920
My turn.

6217
03:06:55,040 --> 03:06:56,240
You lost your privilege.

6218
03:06:57,240 --> 03:06:58,400
Okay, now we can.

6219
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:05,580
Okay, now we wait for the ledge.

6220
03:07:06,560 --> 03:07:08,380
Now we escape to the ledge.

6221
03:07:11,060 --> 03:07:12,460
I have to stay behind.

6222
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:13,800
Unless you...

6223
03:07:14,320 --> 03:07:15,780
Snuffy, you gotta do the jump.

6224
03:07:15,860 --> 03:07:16,920
Snuffy, I trust you.

6225
03:07:17,620 --> 03:07:18,820
Snuffy, you got this.

6226
03:07:19,100 --> 03:07:21,380
You have to do that jump over there.

6227
03:07:21,940 --> 03:07:23,020
She doesn't even know.

6228
03:07:23,380 --> 03:07:25,340
If you wanna stay up there, move right and don't jump.

6229
03:07:25,780 --> 03:07:26,480
I'll do it.

6230
03:07:26,620 --> 03:07:27,300
I'll do the jump.

6231
03:07:27,660 --> 03:07:28,280
I'll do it.

6232
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:31,200
Win this thing.

6233
03:07:31,720 --> 03:07:32,540
Do not move.

6234
03:07:33,140 --> 03:07:34,080
There you go.

6235
03:07:36,220 --> 03:07:37,660
Did you see that?

6236
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:38,380
Nobody move.

6237
03:07:38,780 --> 03:07:39,700
Nobody move.

6238
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:41,120
Do not jump.

6239
03:07:41,160 --> 03:07:41,580
Jump.

6240
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:42,180
Jump.

6241
03:07:42,460 --> 03:07:42,780
Jump.

6242
03:07:42,780 --> 03:07:43,260
Jump.

6243
03:07:43,320 --> 03:07:43,860
Jump.

6244
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:48,720
What happened?

6245
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:53,520
You were all for it.

6246
03:07:54,020 --> 03:07:56,200
I even had people with this thing.

6247
03:07:56,200 --> 03:07:57,140
I forgot about the spikes.

6248
03:07:58,920 --> 03:08:01,280
I think we can get pretty close to the spikes.

6249
03:08:04,020 --> 03:08:05,140
Don't ladder yet.

6250
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:06,020
Do not ladder yet.

6251
03:08:07,240 --> 03:08:08,020
I'm sorry.

6252
03:08:08,400 --> 03:08:09,580
There was no broom.

6253
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:10,780
Don't fucking ladder.

6254
03:08:10,960 --> 03:08:12,000
There was no broom.

6255
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:21,140
We kind of look like condiments on a hot dog.

6256
03:08:21,220 --> 03:08:22,020
We kind of look like condiments on a hot dog.

6257
03:08:22,860 --> 03:08:24,940
Why is it this level?

6258
03:08:25,140 --> 03:08:27,420
Why is this level?

6259
03:08:27,860 --> 03:08:28,440
What do I jump for?

6260
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:30,420
What do I jump for?

6261
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:32,180
I am just a kid.

6262
03:08:32,200 --> 03:08:33,060
I am just a kid.

6263
03:08:33,060 --> 03:08:34,040
Everyone just stack straight.

6264
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:37,160
And now we get to the ledge.

6265
03:08:37,340 --> 03:08:38,480
And now we ladder.

6266
03:08:41,140 --> 03:08:42,100
Ladder time.

6267
03:08:42,100 --> 03:08:43,440
You are safe.

6268
03:08:43,480 --> 03:08:43,900
Don't worry.

6269
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:45,740
You are very safe.

6270
03:08:45,920 --> 03:08:46,660
Big smiles.

6271
03:08:47,500 --> 03:08:48,340
Big smiles.

6272
03:08:49,700 --> 03:08:50,660
Big smiles.

6273
03:08:51,200 --> 03:08:58,140
I think if we stack here, like three and three, we will be able to walk off easier.

6274
03:08:59,340 --> 03:08:59,820
Maybe.

6275
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:00,660
Let's do it.

6276
03:09:00,840 --> 03:09:03,100
One of us still has to press the button though.

6277
03:09:03,400 --> 03:09:04,620
I will press the button.

6278
03:09:05,080 --> 03:09:05,820
I will do it.

6279
03:09:07,960 --> 03:09:09,960
Everyone fall to the right.

6280
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:10,840
Wait, can you...

6281
03:09:12,020 --> 03:09:12,900
Oh, bye.

6282
03:09:14,740 --> 03:09:15,300
It's fine.

6283
03:09:15,400 --> 03:09:16,680
We have one person.

6284
03:09:16,840 --> 03:09:17,380
Yeah, there we go.

6285
03:09:19,240 --> 03:09:20,280
Now jump off.

6286
03:09:20,700 --> 03:09:21,140
What?

6287
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:24,800
What happened?

6288
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:27,360
What happened?

6289
03:09:27,800 --> 03:09:32,880
I feel like we can't just jump off and say I'm jumping off.

6290
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:33,700
I feel like we can't just jump off and say I'm jumping off.

6291
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:33,860
I feel like we can't just jump off and say I'm jumping off.

6292
03:09:33,860 --> 03:09:35,800
You have to be like, okay, let's go.

6293
03:09:35,940 --> 03:09:37,520
Let's jump on three or something.

6294
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:38,620
Don't just jump off.

6295
03:09:38,620 --> 03:09:40,320
No shit.

6296
03:09:40,460 --> 03:09:41,380
That's what's happening.

6297
03:09:41,740 --> 03:09:42,940
We need a 3-2-1.

6298
03:09:43,100 --> 03:09:44,980
The power of the 3-2-1.

6299
03:09:45,340 --> 03:09:48,180
We cannot 3-2-1 because there's fucking spikes.

6300
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:49,220
Meow.

6301
03:09:49,640 --> 03:09:51,320
Meow, meow, meow.

6302
03:09:52,600 --> 03:09:53,660
Meow, meow, meow.

6303
03:09:53,660 --> 03:09:54,280
Meow, meow, meow.

6304
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:55,260
Meow, meow, meow.

6305
03:09:55,460 --> 03:09:57,080
Meow, meow, meow.

6306
03:10:00,060 --> 03:10:01,680
I'm so sorry.

6307
03:10:01,880 --> 03:10:05,860
I can't sing it anymore.

6308
03:10:06,220 --> 03:10:07,100
I know.

6309
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:07,740
I'm so stupid.

6310
03:10:07,940 --> 03:10:11,540
I'm gonna do it, guys.

6311
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:12,400
I'm gonna do it.

6312
03:10:12,440 --> 03:10:13,820
I'm gonna do it right now.

6313
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:14,220
Do it.

6314
03:10:17,560 --> 03:10:18,600
Oh shit.

6315
03:10:18,660 --> 03:10:19,480
I didn't mean to.

6316
03:10:19,940 --> 03:10:22,080
I didn't mean to actually.

6317
03:10:23,500 --> 03:10:24,640
Meow, meow, meow.

6318
03:10:24,900 --> 03:10:25,460
I can't.

6319
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:29,300
I'm gonna do it.

6320
03:10:29,320 --> 03:10:30,240
I'm gonna push Ollie.

6321
03:10:31,080 --> 03:10:32,220
I'm gonna do it.

6322
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:33,380
I'm gonna push Ollie.

6323
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:35,940
Meow, meow.

6324
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:37,660
I'm gonna do it.

6325
03:10:38,600 --> 03:10:39,060
I'm gonna do it.

6326
03:10:39,060 --> 03:10:42,600
Please have mercy.

6327
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:44,540
Ladder.

6328
03:10:46,960 --> 03:10:47,880
Ladder tower.

6329
03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:51,780
Ladder tower.

6330
03:10:51,780 --> 03:10:51,920
Ladder tower.

6331
03:10:53,500 --> 03:10:56,800
Does that thing fucking rubber band horribly for anybody else?

6332
03:10:57,100 --> 03:10:57,860
Does that thing fucking rubber band horribly for anybody else?

6333
03:10:57,860 --> 03:10:58,320
No, it's just you.

6334
03:10:58,380 --> 03:10:59,020
It's just your fin.

6335
03:10:59,020 --> 03:10:59,020
No, it's just you.

6336
03:10:59,020 --> 03:10:59,160
It's just your fin.

6337
03:11:00,760 --> 03:11:01,520
I'll play.

6338
03:11:01,580 --> 03:11:01,720
I'll play.

6339
03:11:01,720 --> 03:11:03,420
I can't do the jump if I'm up here.

6340
03:11:03,420 --> 03:11:04,360
I'm sorry.

6341
03:11:05,280 --> 03:11:07,040
Guys, I'll do the jump.

6342
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:07,720
Watch this.

6343
03:11:08,220 --> 03:11:09,140
I got this.

6344
03:11:09,260 --> 03:11:09,700
Watch this.

6345
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:11,460
Witness me.

6346
03:11:11,680 --> 03:11:12,080
I'm dropping.

6347
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:13,160
Okay.

6348
03:11:17,300 --> 03:11:17,800
Alright.

6349
03:11:19,080 --> 03:11:21,240
Okay, I was a little bit early.

6350
03:11:21,460 --> 03:11:24,620
I'm practicing my jumps right now.

6351
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:25,320
I'm practicing my jumps right now.

6352
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:26,060
I can't even laugh.

6353
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:26,500
It hurts.

6354
03:11:27,460 --> 03:11:29,920
This is the level that breaks us right now.

6355
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:30,280
I'm gonna do it.

6356
03:11:30,360 --> 03:11:31,340
I'm gonna push Amelie.

6357
03:11:31,340 --> 03:11:32,920
This is the mind break level.

6358
03:11:33,280 --> 03:11:35,780
Oh shit, I almost actually ran into that.

6359
03:11:37,480 --> 03:11:38,740
On the plus side, I'm...

6360
03:11:38,740 --> 03:11:41,360
Oh no, actually no, I'm in a really bad position to do the button again.

6361
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:42,060
So...

6362
03:11:43,180 --> 03:11:44,280
It's okay, I believe.

6363
03:11:45,300 --> 03:11:47,100
We can all do it.

6364
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:48,020
I got this.

6365
03:11:48,200 --> 03:11:48,700
You got this.

6366
03:11:51,900 --> 03:11:52,920
It's scary, I know.

6367
03:11:57,860 --> 03:11:59,060
I could go over here.

6368
03:11:59,520 --> 03:12:00,340
Oh, there you go.

6369
03:12:00,540 --> 03:12:00,940
Nice.

6370
03:12:01,340 --> 03:12:02,080
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

6371
03:12:02,560 --> 03:12:03,680
Don't be on my head.

6372
03:12:04,780 --> 03:12:06,180
I'm witnessing, I'm witnessing.

6373
03:12:07,860 --> 03:12:08,360
Okay.

6374
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:10,860
Everybody...

6375
03:12:10,860 --> 03:12:11,380
Go!

6376
03:12:12,500 --> 03:12:14,580
Go, go, go!

6377
03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:17,380
We did it.

6378
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:19,460
The key is on the other side.

6379
03:12:20,380 --> 03:12:21,760
That's easy to get though.

6380
03:12:21,980 --> 03:12:22,840
We're free.

6381
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:23,740
Don't move.

6382
03:12:23,780 --> 03:12:24,420
We're free.

6383
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:27,880
That's all it took.

6384
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:28,940
That's all it took.

6385
03:12:29,360 --> 03:12:30,020
Don't jump.

6386
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:32,280
Oh my god!

6387
03:12:33,220 --> 03:12:34,540
We did it!

6388
03:12:35,060 --> 03:12:35,360
Yeah!

6389
03:12:38,140 --> 03:12:39,280
We did it!

6390
03:12:39,300 --> 03:12:40,780
Skittles are divisible!

6391
03:12:41,580 --> 03:12:42,180
Skittles!

6392
03:12:42,320 --> 03:12:43,560
Oh my god.

6393
03:12:43,580 --> 03:12:46,480
Oh my god.

6394
03:12:47,140 --> 03:12:47,740
Parkland!

6395
03:12:50,360 --> 03:12:51,040
Let's go!

6396
03:12:51,300 --> 03:12:52,900
Everybody, let's play some Suckerball!

6397
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:54,140
What is this?

6398
03:12:54,200 --> 03:12:55,620
What is going on?

6399
03:12:56,440 --> 03:12:57,300
Don't get hit!

6400
03:12:58,720 --> 03:12:59,460
It's Toto!

6401
03:13:01,340 --> 03:13:01,540
Toto!

6402
03:13:02,240 --> 03:13:03,460
It's bullet hell!

6403
03:13:03,980 --> 03:13:06,160
I have this corner.

6404
03:13:06,320 --> 03:13:06,920
I call left.

6405
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:08,080
Far left.

6406
03:13:08,460 --> 03:13:09,960
I love Undertale.

6407
03:13:12,840 --> 03:13:16,100
Remember that the edges are spikes and they'll kill you.

6408
03:13:17,300 --> 03:13:20,220
Guys, we just have to live for 20 seconds.

6409
03:13:20,860 --> 03:13:22,280
I'm grazing, I'm grazing.

6410
03:13:22,760 --> 03:13:23,980
I'm gonna bomb.

6411
03:13:24,980 --> 03:13:26,680
Oh, that's a big ball!

6412
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:27,780
Giant Damaku!

6413
03:13:28,260 --> 03:13:28,980
Giant Damaku!

6414
03:13:31,340 --> 03:13:31,660
It's okay.

6415
03:13:31,780 --> 03:13:32,620
Don't hit the edge!

6416
03:13:32,660 --> 03:13:35,680
I can't even make any sound.

6417
03:13:36,020 --> 03:13:37,420
I'm just full of despair.

6418
03:13:37,980 --> 03:13:39,340
This is so easy!

6419
03:13:40,380 --> 03:13:41,500
Easy game!

6420
03:13:41,940 --> 03:13:42,780
Easy game!

6421
03:13:44,300 --> 03:13:46,020
Easiest Touhou of my life.

6422
03:13:48,080 --> 03:13:49,860
Can they all be that easy?

6423
03:13:50,220 --> 03:13:50,520
Yeah.

6424
03:13:50,940 --> 03:13:53,640
Everything in retrospect is gonna look insane now.

6425
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:57,540
This is just a moving platform.

6426
03:13:57,820 --> 03:13:59,140
This is level one, guys.

6427
03:13:59,140 --> 03:14:00,240
We're not...

6428
03:14:00,240 --> 03:14:01,900
Oh, guys!

6429
03:14:03,420 --> 03:14:03,860
Guys!

6430
03:14:05,160 --> 03:14:06,720
Guys, we must share.

6431
03:14:06,880 --> 03:14:08,040
This is sad.

6432
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:09,680
Be kind to your fellow neighbors.

6433
03:14:09,900 --> 03:14:10,180
Let's go.

6434
03:14:10,240 --> 03:14:13,280
Thank you.

6435
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:15,880
Think about your neighbors.

6436
03:14:16,680 --> 03:14:17,400
No, no, no!

6437
03:14:17,400 --> 03:14:18,120
Why up Amelie?

6438
03:14:18,180 --> 03:14:19,160
Why up Amelie?

6439
03:14:22,400 --> 03:14:24,060
She couldn't be on top of me.

6440
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:25,260
She was like in a bad place there.

6441
03:14:25,260 --> 03:14:26,040
Going down, going down.

6442
03:14:29,360 --> 03:14:31,160
Going down, down.

6443
03:14:31,160 --> 03:14:32,180
Going down, down.

6444
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:34,320
I'm directing Amelie.

6445
03:14:36,120 --> 03:14:38,160
We have to be in track.

6446
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:39,680
Watch out!

6447
03:14:39,700 --> 03:14:40,840
I can't move!

6448
03:14:41,900 --> 03:14:42,580
Okay.

6449
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:47,460
If Amelie's at the corner, it's safe.

6450
03:14:47,740 --> 03:14:48,840
I can't move.

6451
03:14:49,140 --> 03:14:50,680
I couldn't move.

6452
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:56,560
Whoever's in the middle, you must direct.

6453
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:58,300
You must unite together.

6454
03:14:59,140 --> 03:14:59,440
Okay.

6455
03:14:59,980 --> 03:15:00,600
I'm up.

6456
03:15:01,680 --> 03:15:02,840
Amelie is so dead.

6457
03:15:02,980 --> 03:15:05,500
I couldn't go any more down.

6458
03:15:06,500 --> 03:15:07,840
There was nowhere to go.

6459
03:15:08,780 --> 03:15:09,360
It's okay.

6460
03:15:09,440 --> 03:15:10,900
We can keep doing this.

6461
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:14,800
Think of your neighbor.

6462
03:15:16,380 --> 03:15:16,820
Snuffy?

6463
03:15:17,440 --> 03:15:18,700
There was nowhere to go.

6464
03:15:18,820 --> 03:15:20,700
I was gonna die on the bottom or die in the middle.

6465
03:15:20,980 --> 03:15:22,040
There was nothing to do.

6466
03:15:22,300 --> 03:15:24,900
We gotta give bottom person a lot of space too.

6467
03:15:26,020 --> 03:15:26,900
Thread the needle.

6468
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:27,880
Thread the needle.

6469
03:15:29,140 --> 03:15:32,820
I don't think two people can fit through that one.

6470
03:15:32,900 --> 03:15:33,780
No, they cannot.

6471
03:15:34,120 --> 03:15:36,460
I'm trying to give you room.

6472
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:36,980
I saw her.

6473
03:15:37,180 --> 03:15:39,680
I went to the bottom.

6474
03:15:39,960 --> 03:15:41,740
Look at how bottom I am.

6475
03:15:45,900 --> 03:15:47,320
Up, up, up.

6476
03:15:47,920 --> 03:15:49,300
He touched my ass.

6477
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:54,540
You cannot have two on the bottom either.

6478
03:15:54,860 --> 03:15:57,400
It needs to be four top and one in the middle.

6479
03:15:57,640 --> 03:15:58,160
Maybe.

6480
03:15:59,140 --> 03:16:00,100
I can top four people.

6481
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:03,160
I couldn't.

6482
03:16:03,340 --> 03:16:05,140
I couldn't.

6483
03:16:05,280 --> 03:16:07,040
You could not do that.

6484
03:16:08,460 --> 03:16:09,700
It's so hard to see.

6485
03:16:10,940 --> 03:16:12,780
Up, up, up.

6486
03:16:12,980 --> 03:16:13,460
Up, up, up.

6487
03:16:13,940 --> 03:16:15,220
Up, up, up.

6488
03:16:15,220 --> 03:16:15,780
Up, up, up.

6489
03:16:16,400 --> 03:16:17,060
Up, up, up.

6490
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:26,200
She can't fly.

6491
03:16:26,780 --> 03:16:27,900
I'm all the way up.

6492
03:16:27,920 --> 03:16:28,620
I'm all the way up.

6493
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:31,680
Separate.

6494
03:16:31,700 --> 03:16:31,940
Four.

6495
03:16:33,020 --> 03:16:34,140
I need to go down.

6496
03:16:34,160 --> 03:16:35,700
I need to go down.

6497
03:16:35,880 --> 03:16:36,880
I'm up.

6498
03:16:36,960 --> 03:16:38,300
I'm in the middle.

6499
03:16:39,440 --> 03:16:40,660
I need to go down.

6500
03:16:40,740 --> 03:16:41,620
I need to go down.

6501
03:16:44,380 --> 03:16:45,340
I'm up.

6502
03:16:47,660 --> 03:16:52,380
How do we pass the key that much?

6503
03:16:52,420 --> 03:16:52,620
Wow.

6504
03:16:53,920 --> 03:16:55,760
From the bottom to the top.

6505
03:16:57,340 --> 03:16:57,940
That's crazy.

6506
03:16:59,220 --> 03:17:00,820
This one is not so bad though.

6507
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:01,600
Yeah.

6508
03:17:02,720 --> 03:17:03,300
I'm getting the hang of it.

6509
03:17:03,400 --> 03:17:05,480
The randomized positions are kind of beans.

6510
03:17:05,800 --> 03:17:07,540
I think we just kind of needed the spacing.

6511
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:08,780
Oh, I think we got the hang of it now.

6512
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:11,340
Yeah, we're figuring out how the hitbox is.

6513
03:17:11,840 --> 03:17:13,560
V2 versus depth perception.

6514
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:14,680
Because it's the movie.

6515
03:17:16,860 --> 03:17:17,580
Oh, goodbye.

6516
03:17:17,940 --> 03:17:18,500
I got what I brought.

6517
03:17:20,600 --> 03:17:22,940
The bottom to the bottom in the beginning, I think.

6518
03:17:23,040 --> 03:17:24,200
It's the same map, no?

6519
03:17:24,720 --> 03:17:25,720
It's the same one, yeah.

6520
03:17:26,600 --> 03:17:27,800
It's just randomized.

6521
03:17:28,540 --> 03:17:29,940
Alright, now four and one in the middle.

6522
03:17:29,940 --> 03:17:30,580
Oh.

6523
03:17:31,400 --> 03:17:33,420
No, it's five up, one in the middle.

6524
03:17:33,500 --> 03:17:34,280
Sorry, five up.

6525
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:38,420
Going down.

6526
03:17:39,700 --> 03:17:40,420
Going down.

6527
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:42,300
Alright, five up, one in the middle.

6528
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:43,200
Five up, one in the middle.

6529
03:17:43,900 --> 03:17:45,180
Alright, now we go down.

6530
03:17:45,280 --> 03:17:46,100
We go down.

6531
03:17:47,580 --> 03:17:48,300
Go down.

6532
03:17:48,580 --> 03:17:50,480
Meow, meow, meow.

6533
03:17:52,900 --> 03:17:53,640
Down, down, down.

6534
03:17:54,880 --> 03:17:56,500
These ones move, these ones move.

6535
03:17:56,500 --> 03:17:56,840
Be careful.

6536
03:17:57,140 --> 03:17:57,520
Give me room.

6537
03:17:57,520 --> 03:17:58,900
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

6538
03:18:01,880 --> 03:18:02,240
I

6539
03:18:06,680 --> 03:18:08,600
am just a kid.

6540
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:09,620
I couldn't move.

6541
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:11,480
Bailey fits my man.

6542
03:18:12,860 --> 03:18:14,440
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

6543
03:18:14,460 --> 03:18:14,620
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6544
03:18:16,080 --> 03:18:16,440
Okay.

6545
03:18:18,460 --> 03:18:19,260
Alright, now five.

6546
03:18:19,360 --> 03:18:19,940
One in the middle.

6547
03:18:19,980 --> 03:18:20,640
Five, one in the middle.

6548
03:18:20,920 --> 03:18:21,280
Okay.

6549
03:18:22,880 --> 03:18:23,960
Down, down.

6550
03:18:24,460 --> 03:18:25,280
Ow, ow, ow.

6551
03:18:28,240 --> 03:18:28,600
Stupid.

6552
03:18:29,120 --> 03:18:30,940
I was so busy.

6553
03:18:35,540 --> 03:18:36,400
Oh, fuck.

6554
03:18:36,860 --> 03:18:37,860
That's my baddest.

6555
03:18:37,900 --> 03:18:38,460
I've gone down.

6556
03:18:39,260 --> 03:18:39,660
Sorry.

6557
03:18:40,600 --> 03:18:41,000
Sorry.

6558
03:18:41,800 --> 03:18:42,200
Okay.

6559
03:18:44,320 --> 03:18:45,500
I don't think it's three here.

6560
03:18:45,620 --> 03:18:45,780
Yeah.

6561
03:18:45,800 --> 03:18:47,320
Okay, now five up and one in the middle.

6562
03:18:49,060 --> 03:18:50,120
Okay, now down.

6563
03:18:50,340 --> 03:18:51,020
I'm scared.

6564
03:18:51,660 --> 03:18:52,060
No.

6565
03:18:54,980 --> 03:18:55,380
Okay.

6566
03:18:56,080 --> 03:18:59,180
I'm not used to being at the very bottom.

6567
03:18:59,380 --> 03:18:59,840
It's okay.

6568
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:01,820
Up, up, up.

6569
03:19:02,260 --> 03:19:03,000
Alright, five.

6570
03:19:03,200 --> 03:19:03,940
One in the middle.

6571
03:19:03,960 --> 03:19:04,240
Five.

6572
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:04,460
One in the middle.

6573
03:19:04,480 --> 03:19:05,180
God, I'm bitching.

6574
03:19:05,620 --> 03:19:07,760
Alright, down, down, down, down, down.

6575
03:19:07,820 --> 03:19:08,500
Down a little.

6576
03:19:08,660 --> 03:19:09,540
Down a little for me.

6577
03:19:09,860 --> 03:19:10,480
Alright, up.

6578
03:19:10,480 --> 03:19:10,980
I'm going up.

6579
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:11,440
I'm going up.

6580
03:19:11,640 --> 03:19:12,880
Alright, I'm threading the needle.

6581
03:19:12,900 --> 03:19:15,720
Down, down, down, down.

6582
03:19:15,800 --> 03:19:16,760
I'm going, I'm going.

6583
03:19:16,800 --> 03:19:17,660
I'm threading the needle.

6584
03:19:17,960 --> 03:19:18,640
Alright, everybody.

6585
03:19:18,940 --> 03:19:20,160
Every man for themselves.

6586
03:19:27,020 --> 03:19:28,460
Every man for themselves.

6587
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:33,360
Oh my god.

6588
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:34,380
Holy fuck.

6589
03:19:36,500 --> 03:19:38,360
Guys, I don't think that was it.

6590
03:19:38,360 --> 03:19:41,360
Guys, I don't think that we should have every man for themselves.

6591
03:19:42,980 --> 03:19:44,340
Guys, I don't think that we should have every man for themselves.

6592
03:19:44,340 --> 03:19:45,360
I don't know how to judge.

6593
03:19:45,880 --> 03:19:46,360
I don't know.

6594
03:19:46,660 --> 03:19:47,760
How do I just let go?

6595
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:50,840
Just let go.

6596
03:19:51,140 --> 03:19:51,760
It's over.

6597
03:19:51,800 --> 03:19:52,180
Alright, five up.

6598
03:19:52,180 --> 03:19:52,660
One in the middle.

6599
03:19:53,560 --> 03:19:55,440
Alright, down, down a little.

6600
03:19:55,560 --> 03:19:56,060
Down, down, down.

6601
03:19:56,360 --> 03:19:57,720
Please more down.

6602
03:19:57,960 --> 03:19:59,020
Okay, we're fine.

6603
03:19:59,320 --> 03:20:00,080
Thread the needle.

6604
03:20:00,260 --> 03:20:00,980
No, you're gonna get hit.

6605
03:20:02,040 --> 03:20:04,300
Sorry, I did not thread the needle.

6606
03:20:04,600 --> 03:20:05,100
Thread the needle.

6607
03:20:05,100 --> 03:20:06,940
What happened to the thread?

6608
03:20:07,320 --> 03:20:08,180
My depth perception.

6609
03:20:10,080 --> 03:20:11,600
Versus depth perception.

6610
03:20:11,980 --> 03:20:12,580
That's true.

6611
03:20:12,760 --> 03:20:13,480
More beautiful.

6612
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:14,580
Five up.

6613
03:20:14,580 --> 03:20:15,280
One in the middle.

6614
03:20:16,020 --> 03:20:17,020
Down, please.

6615
03:20:19,060 --> 03:20:20,440
One up a little.

6616
03:20:22,040 --> 03:20:23,020
Thread the needle.

6617
03:20:23,140 --> 03:20:23,720
Nice.

6618
03:20:23,900 --> 03:20:24,600
Down, down.

6619
03:20:24,900 --> 03:20:26,300
I'll thread the needle.

6620
03:20:27,420 --> 03:20:28,680
Every man for themselves.

6621
03:20:29,040 --> 03:20:29,680
Every man for themselves.

6622
03:20:31,100 --> 03:20:31,700
Wait.

6623
03:20:33,360 --> 03:20:33,960
No!

6624
03:20:35,100 --> 03:20:35,240
Wait.

6625
03:20:35,460 --> 03:20:36,780
What do you mean no?

6626
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:37,560
Oh.

6627
03:20:37,560 --> 03:20:40,200
That was a horrible scream.

6628
03:20:41,260 --> 03:20:43,260
That was a horrible scream.

6629
03:20:43,260 --> 03:20:45,080
That was a horrible scream.

6630
03:20:45,080 --> 03:20:48,160
I thought we were gonna crash into the wall.

6631
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:51,160
I was just really happy we finished.

6632
03:20:51,280 --> 03:20:53,240
I just wanted to stay there so long.

6633
03:20:53,320 --> 03:20:57,340
I thought you should have crashed into the wall like Corpse Pride or some shit.

6634
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:58,200
I thought you should have crashed into the wall like Corpse Pride or some shit.

6635
03:20:58,240 --> 03:20:59,280
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6636
03:20:59,380 --> 03:20:59,800
No, no.

6637
03:20:59,860 --> 03:21:00,620
I'm not ready.

6638
03:21:00,660 --> 03:21:00,940
You cannot pee.

6639
03:21:01,280 --> 03:21:03,580
You cannot pee.

6640
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:05,840
Okay, she's peeing.

6641
03:21:07,140 --> 03:21:08,440
Guys, she's peeing.

6642
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:11,320
She's doing the forbidden piss.

6643
03:21:11,440 --> 03:21:13,360
What if she just actually makes it through without moving?

6644
03:21:13,540 --> 03:21:14,420
No way.

6645
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:15,720
That would be crazy.

6646
03:21:17,240 --> 03:21:17,680
Nice.

6647
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:20,960
Oh, no.

6648
03:21:21,060 --> 03:21:22,040
It keeps restarting.

6649
03:21:22,040 --> 03:21:23,320
We're just gonna be here forever.

6650
03:21:24,200 --> 03:21:24,840
It's okay.

6651
03:21:25,620 --> 03:21:26,260
It's practice.

6652
03:21:27,880 --> 03:21:28,980
I'm gonna look at Twitter.

6653
03:21:29,040 --> 03:21:30,380
You guys enjoy that practice.

6654
03:21:30,760 --> 03:21:31,120
I'm grazing.

6655
03:21:31,420 --> 03:21:31,680
I'm grazing.

6656
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:33,380
Nothing's gonna hit that forever.

6657
03:21:33,740 --> 03:21:35,180
This is not randomized.

6658
03:21:36,220 --> 03:21:37,740
She'll always hit those.

6659
03:21:37,760 --> 03:21:37,820
I'm bombing.

6660
03:21:38,020 --> 03:21:39,800
I need to check my For You page.

6661
03:21:43,440 --> 03:21:45,020
No damn way.

6662
03:21:47,440 --> 03:21:47,720
Chat.

6663
03:21:49,360 --> 03:21:50,640
Where am I?

6664
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:58,000
How many worlds left are there?

6665
03:21:58,940 --> 03:22:01,120
We still have the battle realm level.

6666
03:22:01,680 --> 03:22:02,680
Oh, hell no.

6667
03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:04,420
I think someone said though something.

6668
03:22:04,680 --> 03:22:05,920
Unlock after we beat the game.

6669
03:22:05,920 --> 03:22:08,620
Yeah, we can't beat the game because of the flashbang though.

6670
03:22:09,340 --> 03:22:10,540
I think like one per...

6671
03:22:10,540 --> 03:22:13,520
I have to beat it by myself to unlock it.

6672
03:22:13,640 --> 03:22:14,020
Or something.

6673
03:22:15,220 --> 03:22:17,700
So the flashbang would be gone.

6674
03:22:17,980 --> 03:22:19,040
We're actually in hell.

6675
03:22:19,200 --> 03:22:19,560
Okay.

6676
03:22:19,720 --> 03:22:20,420
Oh, no.

6677
03:22:21,920 --> 03:22:23,720
I wanna use the bathroom now.

6678
03:22:25,720 --> 03:22:27,040
We take a potty break.

6679
03:22:27,440 --> 03:22:29,040
Alright, let's all use the bathroom.

6680
03:22:29,120 --> 03:22:30,060
I'm using the bathroom.

6681
03:22:30,160 --> 03:22:30,480
I swear.

6682
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:32,640
After I leave, I swear to god.

6683
03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:34,180
Okay, I will do the same thing.

6684
03:22:34,180 --> 03:22:35,000
Potty break, potty break.

6685
03:22:35,180 --> 03:22:35,840
Everybody potty.

6686
03:22:37,080 --> 03:22:38,220
What just happened?

6687
03:22:40,140 --> 03:22:42,160
Oh, I guess it's just me and...

6688
03:22:42,160 --> 03:22:43,180
Is that Min?

6689
03:22:44,020 --> 03:22:45,680
No, I'm still here.

6690
03:22:46,640 --> 03:22:47,460
I'm gonna kill.

6691
03:22:47,460 --> 03:22:51,060
I figured if I enter zen zone, I won't hear the music anymore.

6692
03:22:51,360 --> 03:22:51,920
Yeah, me too.

6693
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:54,960
At some point, I will find a headspace where the music just ceases to be.

6694
03:22:55,140 --> 03:22:56,640
I'll just sing it louder for you.

6695
03:22:56,800 --> 03:23:00,080
Do do do do do do do do do do do do.

6696
03:23:00,080 --> 03:23:04,040
You better fucking hope there isn't another ball collection level, Min.

6697
03:23:04,600 --> 03:23:05,440
I know.

6698
03:23:07,200 --> 03:23:07,660
Chat.

6699
03:23:07,660 --> 03:23:10,180
You just have better eyes than me because you don't go out in the sun, okay?

6700
03:23:10,180 --> 03:23:12,020
I have a vignette over my vision.

6701
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:13,760
It's like a dark filter.

6702
03:23:14,300 --> 03:23:16,060
And it's like closing in.

6703
03:23:16,160 --> 03:23:19,060
Like my vision is tunneling the longer I stare at the game.

6704
03:23:19,060 --> 03:23:19,780
That's called locking in.

6705
03:23:19,860 --> 03:23:24,460
Do you mean like in video games where they symbolize losing your health by the world just kinda going black?

6706
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:25,520
Yeah, no.

6707
03:23:25,660 --> 03:23:29,180
For real, on god, that is what's happening to me right now.

6708
03:23:29,740 --> 03:23:32,420
I've been staring like in the...

6709
03:23:36,360 --> 03:23:37,960
Beep boop beep boop boop.

6710
03:23:39,020 --> 03:23:40,400
Chat, where even are we?

6711
03:23:40,400 --> 03:23:42,200
I'd like to know what this music sounds like on a Genesis.

6712
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:43,500
I think it'd sound great.

6713
03:23:43,820 --> 03:23:45,720
Make it a bit more farty.

6714
03:23:46,560 --> 03:23:50,000
Wait, so how many worlds do we have left?

6715
03:23:50,240 --> 03:23:50,720
I'm back.

6716
03:23:51,100 --> 03:23:52,280
It's like 15 total.

6717
03:23:52,420 --> 03:23:53,100
That was so fast.

6718
03:23:53,820 --> 03:23:56,400
So we have four left?

6719
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:58,560
Four worlds, I guess.

6720
03:23:59,180 --> 03:24:01,460
Four worlds, and then how many levels are within those worlds?

6721
03:24:02,140 --> 03:24:02,500
Four.

6722
03:24:03,260 --> 03:24:03,980
Four each.

6723
03:24:05,360 --> 03:24:06,360
We're so close.

6724
03:24:09,060 --> 03:24:10,540
But I was like, we don't have much to go.

6725
03:24:10,600 --> 03:24:12,100
Oh god, we have so much to go.

6726
03:24:12,260 --> 03:24:13,120
We're so close.

6727
03:24:13,320 --> 03:24:14,440
We're zooming.

6728
03:24:16,460 --> 03:24:17,080
We're zooming.

6729
03:24:17,900 --> 03:24:19,440
Wait, Snuffy is still gone?

6730
03:24:20,240 --> 03:24:21,280
Snuffy is still gone.

6731
03:24:21,340 --> 03:24:22,240
I'm mildly concerned.

6732
03:24:22,680 --> 03:24:23,640
Me too, I think.

6733
03:24:24,240 --> 03:24:25,760
I don't think she wants to come back.

6734
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:29,160
Why is she making my story long enough to just end?

6735
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:32,760
If I don't come back in 15 minutes, the class will leave.

6736
03:24:32,920 --> 03:24:33,180
If I don't come back in 15 minutes, the class will leave.

6737
03:24:33,180 --> 03:24:33,780
I can't.

6738
03:24:35,880 --> 03:24:38,080
You can't have my spot, Doki.

6739
03:24:38,200 --> 03:24:38,400
You can't have my spot, Doki.

6740
03:24:38,400 --> 03:24:38,840
Stop trying.

6741
03:24:39,820 --> 03:24:43,720
If your Snuffy is more than 15 minutes late, you can legally leave the collab.

6742
03:24:46,880 --> 03:24:48,340
This is my spot.

6743
03:24:48,380 --> 03:24:48,820
Oh yeah?

6744
03:24:50,400 --> 03:24:51,980
That's right, I die first.

6745
03:24:52,360 --> 03:24:52,420
I'm here!

6746
03:24:52,820 --> 03:24:53,540
I'm sorry.

6747
03:24:54,140 --> 03:24:54,940
I'm back.

6748
03:24:55,760 --> 03:24:56,960
I think we're waiting on Juniproductor.

6749
03:24:56,960 --> 03:24:57,720
Hi, welcome back!

6750
03:24:58,440 --> 03:24:58,880
Jopanar.

6751
03:24:59,520 --> 03:25:01,560
That's right, now you'll never get your spot.

6752
03:25:02,260 --> 03:25:03,140
Oh, Jopanar.

6753
03:25:03,340 --> 03:25:04,300
And Amelie.

6754
03:25:04,780 --> 03:25:05,740
Oh, Shpupupur.

6755
03:25:07,020 --> 03:25:07,880
Oh, Bububur.

6756
03:25:10,220 --> 03:25:11,700
We're almost there, guys.

6757
03:25:11,900 --> 03:25:12,600
We're so close.

6758
03:25:12,900 --> 03:25:13,900
What's the tech here?

6759
03:25:13,960 --> 03:25:14,600
What have you guys learned?

6760
03:25:15,500 --> 03:25:17,520
It's just die really fast.

6761
03:25:17,580 --> 03:25:20,560
You die faster from the walls than the middle.

6762
03:25:21,240 --> 03:25:22,800
Yeah, just go to the walls.

6763
03:25:22,860 --> 03:25:24,560
Just hug the wall and then it'll be over.

6764
03:25:28,900 --> 03:25:31,580
Letting Mint die over and over while I just look at my phone.

6765
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:31,920
The electricity.

6766
03:25:33,460 --> 03:25:34,400
We're all here!

6767
03:25:34,460 --> 03:25:34,820
Let's go!

6768
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:36,200
We're back!

6769
03:25:36,560 --> 03:25:36,700
We're back!

6770
03:25:37,100 --> 03:25:37,940
Alright, let's go.

6771
03:25:38,180 --> 03:25:38,680
We got this.

6772
03:25:38,760 --> 03:25:39,860
Alright, this is real.

6773
03:25:40,320 --> 03:25:40,960
This is real.

6774
03:25:42,540 --> 03:25:43,720
This is real now.

6775
03:25:45,440 --> 03:25:46,600
This is my corner.

6776
03:25:47,020 --> 03:25:48,700
What's the difference between red and blue?

6777
03:25:49,300 --> 03:25:49,740
Nothing.

6778
03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:50,600
They're the same.

6779
03:25:50,980 --> 03:25:51,860
Blue is good.

6780
03:25:51,980 --> 03:25:52,500
Blue is good.

6781
03:25:52,580 --> 03:25:53,400
Blue is not good.

6782
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:54,160
Blue is not good.

6783
03:25:54,160 --> 03:25:54,540
I saw the blue.

6784
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:55,680
Blue is not good.

6785
03:25:55,780 --> 03:25:56,660
I saw you eat two.

6786
03:25:56,900 --> 03:25:57,980
It's making me glow.

6787
03:25:58,960 --> 03:25:59,400
It's making me glow.

6788
03:25:59,400 --> 03:26:00,000
I'm like a snowman.

6789
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:00,320
Oh my god.

6790
03:26:00,380 --> 03:26:00,700
The daddy.

6791
03:26:00,840 --> 03:26:01,280
Ah!

6792
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:02,560
Michael died!

6793
03:26:02,940 --> 03:26:03,580
I fucked it.

6794
03:26:03,980 --> 03:26:05,100
Blue was not good, chat.

6795
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:08,320
We haven't seen that part yet because Snuffy always died while he ate cake.

6796
03:26:09,660 --> 03:26:10,820
I know, yeah.

6797
03:26:10,960 --> 03:26:11,340
I never saw that.

6798
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:11,720
It's true.

6799
03:26:13,640 --> 03:26:15,320
I was eating the blue dot.

6800
03:26:15,860 --> 03:26:18,060
Yeah, she took two of our lives from it.

6801
03:26:18,160 --> 03:26:19,920
She was like, blue is good, guys.

6802
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:22,600
It tastes like blue raspberry.

6803
03:26:23,200 --> 03:26:23,640
Yeah.

6804
03:26:23,760 --> 03:26:24,200
Yeah.

6805
03:26:24,200 --> 03:26:24,540
It's true.

6806
03:26:24,540 --> 03:26:25,760
It's strawberry and blue raspberry.

6807
03:26:25,920 --> 03:26:26,860
Cold pull, yummers.

6808
03:26:26,920 --> 03:26:27,640
Alright, here it is.

6809
03:26:27,700 --> 03:26:29,020
Here's the thing we didn't get to see.

6810
03:26:31,520 --> 03:26:33,080
Then the blue ones disappear.

6811
03:26:33,240 --> 03:26:33,880
It's so easy.

6812
03:26:34,260 --> 03:26:34,700
Yeah.

6813
03:26:35,380 --> 03:26:35,820
Goodbye.

6814
03:26:36,100 --> 03:26:36,740
Okay, just go right.

6815
03:26:37,440 --> 03:26:38,880
Oh, that's a door, not a box.

6816
03:26:39,480 --> 03:26:41,100
Guys, 12 more seconds, guys.

6817
03:26:41,620 --> 03:26:42,680
12 more seconds.

6818
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:46,120
One more life.

6819
03:26:46,320 --> 03:26:47,580
Guys, just chill.

6820
03:26:47,820 --> 03:26:48,280
It's fine.

6821
03:26:48,380 --> 03:26:48,800
We're chill.

6822
03:26:48,820 --> 03:26:49,200
We're chill.

6823
03:26:49,540 --> 03:26:49,980
We're chill.

6824
03:26:50,120 --> 03:26:50,780
We're chill.

6825
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:51,100
We're chill.

6826
03:26:51,120 --> 03:26:51,200
We're chill.

6827
03:26:51,200 --> 03:26:51,360
We're chill.

6828
03:26:52,500 --> 03:26:52,940
We're chill.

6829
03:26:52,940 --> 03:26:53,020
We're chill.

6830
03:26:53,020 --> 03:26:53,080
We're chill.

6831
03:26:53,080 --> 03:26:53,480
We're chill.

6832
03:26:54,040 --> 03:26:54,480
We're chill.

6833
03:26:54,480 --> 03:26:54,660
Skyeeeey.

6834
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:56,660
Oh that.

6835
03:26:57,220 --> 03:26:58,040
I told you.

6836
03:26:58,100 --> 03:26:58,860
Look at that.

6837
03:26:59,060 --> 03:27:03,240
I saw you look at the sparkling light there.

6838
03:27:05,280 --> 03:27:06,940
What does that do?

6839
03:27:07,700 --> 03:27:08,120
Yeah.

6840
03:27:09,320 --> 03:27:10,820
I didn't get to sample it.

6841
03:27:10,880 --> 03:27:12,160
You guys got to eat that all night.

6842
03:27:13,380 --> 03:27:14,440
Wait, don't jump.

6843
03:27:14,560 --> 03:27:15,160
Don't jump.

6844
03:27:15,160 --> 03:27:15,980
Do not jump.

6845
03:27:16,120 --> 03:27:17,500
Wait, find out a place to...

6846
03:27:17,500 --> 03:27:19,120
Don't kill us.

6847
03:27:19,540 --> 03:27:20,540
I was okay.

6848
03:27:21,420 --> 03:27:23,500
We got to eat nights, each and every time to...

6849
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:24,280
Oh boy.

6850
03:27:24,280 --> 03:27:25,560
Okay, so it's never ending.

6851
03:27:25,820 --> 03:27:26,980
Okay, I'm staying in the middle.

6852
03:27:27,800 --> 03:27:29,040
Alright, this is my spot.

6853
03:27:29,420 --> 03:27:30,400
This is my spot.

6854
03:27:32,580 --> 03:27:33,720
There's two rounds!

6855
03:27:33,800 --> 03:27:34,760
There's two rounds!

6856
03:27:35,320 --> 03:27:36,820
Did someone just panic jump?

6857
03:27:38,400 --> 03:27:40,220
Okay, a bunch of people in the middle.

6858
03:27:40,320 --> 03:27:41,220
Two of us on the right.

6859
03:27:41,660 --> 03:27:43,420
This is randomized, too.

6860
03:27:44,400 --> 03:27:45,120
There's another one!

6861
03:27:45,260 --> 03:27:45,980
There's another one!

6862
03:27:45,980 --> 03:27:46,460
Left, left, left!

6863
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:50,060
Move your big butt over!

6864
03:27:50,640 --> 03:27:51,860
Oh, we did it!

6865
03:27:51,860 --> 03:27:52,800
Two seconds!

6866
03:27:56,440 --> 03:27:57,960
But this is so difficult.

6867
03:27:58,560 --> 03:28:00,200
Guys, this is randomized, too.

6868
03:28:00,380 --> 03:28:01,140
Go all the way to the right!

6869
03:28:03,040 --> 03:28:03,920
I lived.

6870
03:28:08,800 --> 03:28:10,840
All I'm saying is that I lived.

6871
03:28:10,900 --> 03:28:11,700
Okay, a lot of people to the left.

6872
03:28:12,140 --> 03:28:12,580
Alright.

6873
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:15,700
Why are you here, CJ?

6874
03:28:16,120 --> 03:28:17,960
I think that was one spot!

6875
03:28:20,080 --> 03:28:22,320
We all have one death.

6876
03:28:22,400 --> 03:28:23,060
That was my one.

6877
03:28:24,480 --> 03:28:25,240
That was your one death.

6878
03:28:25,240 --> 03:28:26,680
That was my one death today.

6879
03:28:26,900 --> 03:28:29,660
Oh, that was freaky.

6880
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:31,000
Alright, we're all good.

6881
03:28:32,200 --> 03:28:32,500
Kissing.

6882
03:28:32,560 --> 03:28:33,160
Woah!

6883
03:28:35,480 --> 03:28:37,120
There's a lot of space on my end.

6884
03:28:37,440 --> 03:28:38,700
Yeah, Doki, I'm with you.

6885
03:28:39,760 --> 03:28:43,300
Oh, 15 seconds, guys!

6886
03:28:44,040 --> 03:28:44,240
Hi!

6887
03:28:44,580 --> 03:28:45,160
Hi!

6888
03:28:45,260 --> 03:28:45,860
No,

6889
03:28:49,100 --> 03:28:50,580
I sacrificed myself for you!

6890
03:28:53,640 --> 03:28:54,840
I did.

6891
03:28:54,900 --> 03:28:55,320
I lived.

6892
03:28:56,780 --> 03:28:57,220
No!

6893
03:28:59,200 --> 03:29:00,000
I'm sorry!

6894
03:29:00,380 --> 03:29:01,300
You're so safe.

6895
03:29:01,980 --> 03:29:02,880
I was sentenced to death.

6896
03:29:03,120 --> 03:29:05,480
What were your crimes?

6897
03:29:06,980 --> 03:29:08,520
Go, go, go, go!

6898
03:29:08,740 --> 03:29:09,220
Go, go, go!

6899
03:29:13,360 --> 03:29:16,120
We need to spread out more so there's more room to move.

6900
03:29:16,340 --> 03:29:18,480
Even if you have a spot, we need more room.

6901
03:29:19,480 --> 03:29:20,380
Oh, okay.

6902
03:29:20,500 --> 03:29:21,340
This is weird.

6903
03:29:21,860 --> 03:29:22,480
I got it.

6904
03:29:23,400 --> 03:29:23,840
Okay.

6905
03:29:28,040 --> 03:29:28,480
Oh.

6906
03:29:30,940 --> 03:29:31,880
Oh, no.

6907
03:29:32,060 --> 03:29:32,500
Alright.

6908
03:29:33,160 --> 03:29:34,120
There's so many.

6909
03:29:34,240 --> 03:29:34,860
There's a lot.

6910
03:29:34,980 --> 03:29:35,080
Help me!

6911
03:29:35,820 --> 03:29:36,580
Okay, thank you.

6912
03:29:36,920 --> 03:29:37,560
Thank you.

6913
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:38,220
Oh, fuck.

6914
03:29:38,620 --> 03:29:39,320
No pressure.

6915
03:29:39,340 --> 03:29:40,100
No pressure, by the way.

6916
03:29:40,100 --> 03:29:40,460
Thank you, though.

6917
03:29:46,480 --> 03:29:48,060
I'm on my own.

6918
03:29:48,200 --> 03:29:50,460
You guys, there's, like, so much room over here!

6919
03:29:51,420 --> 03:29:52,760
You still died!

6920
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:56,300
I... I... I...

6921
03:29:56,520 --> 03:29:56,720
No, no!

6922
03:29:57,100 --> 03:30:00,720
I was giving rooms for everybody else!

6923
03:30:02,780 --> 03:30:03,840
Okay, nice.

6924
03:30:04,190 --> 03:30:04,900
Oh, not nice.

6925
03:30:05,040 --> 03:30:06,460
Not nice.

6926
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:10,480
Beware of falling rocks.

6927
03:30:11,420 --> 03:30:13,120
Why don't they give us helmets?

6928
03:30:14,980 --> 03:30:15,940
We're okay.

6929
03:30:16,360 --> 03:30:16,760
Okay.

6930
03:30:17,120 --> 03:30:20,660
They should at least give someone, like, a little shield.

6931
03:30:22,310 --> 03:30:22,760
We're okay.

6932
03:30:22,980 --> 03:30:24,080
Everything is fine.

6933
03:30:24,080 --> 03:30:25,920
This is so spacious over here.

6934
03:30:26,520 --> 03:30:26,840
I'm loving it.

6935
03:30:26,880 --> 03:30:27,600
Will we live?

6936
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:30,440
15 seconds, guys!

6937
03:30:31,740 --> 03:30:33,040
There we go.

6938
03:30:33,120 --> 03:30:33,240
Yeah.

6939
03:30:34,840 --> 03:30:35,660
Oh, nice!

6940
03:30:35,940 --> 03:30:37,020
What the fuck?

6941
03:30:37,140 --> 03:30:39,160
No, we won't live here!

6942
03:30:39,240 --> 03:30:39,680
We won't!

6943
03:30:40,800 --> 03:30:41,380
What?

6944
03:30:41,900 --> 03:30:43,880
What the fuck happened there?

6945
03:30:44,220 --> 03:30:44,660
What?

6946
03:30:44,900 --> 03:30:48,940
Why did all you guys bunch down?

6947
03:30:49,240 --> 03:30:49,340
No one would know!

6948
03:30:54,560 --> 03:30:55,700
That was mean.

6949
03:30:56,240 --> 03:30:57,080
That was mean.

6950
03:30:57,180 --> 03:30:57,420
That was cruel.

6951
03:30:57,820 --> 03:30:59,480
I shouldn't have been so against the wall.

6952
03:30:59,960 --> 03:31:01,240
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6953
03:31:02,480 --> 03:31:03,960
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6954
03:31:05,020 --> 03:31:05,560
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6955
03:31:05,560 --> 03:31:06,400
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6956
03:31:06,400 --> 03:31:07,580
I stare at you like this.

6957
03:31:07,600 --> 03:31:09,420
Oh, we're competing against that hole there.

6958
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:11,700
Yeah, I think we both had to move left there.

6959
03:31:12,360 --> 03:31:13,740
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

6960
03:31:15,160 --> 03:31:16,360
My chat is mad at me.

6961
03:31:16,380 --> 03:31:17,640
They said I could jump on people.

6962
03:31:17,640 --> 03:31:19,600
No, you can't!

6963
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:21,440
There's literally an electric balloon!

6964
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:23,660
A balloon!

6965
03:31:23,940 --> 03:31:24,500
A balloon!

6966
03:31:29,980 --> 03:31:33,260
You guys saw Mint just pushing out.

6967
03:31:33,280 --> 03:31:33,660
A balloon!

6968
03:31:34,320 --> 03:31:35,000
Please!

6969
03:31:38,600 --> 03:31:39,960
Please, move!

6970
03:31:40,140 --> 03:31:40,920
Please, move!

6971
03:31:40,920 --> 03:31:40,960
Please, move!

6972
03:31:41,140 --> 03:31:41,880
I won't make it!

6973
03:31:42,740 --> 03:31:44,120
Give us space!

6974
03:31:46,640 --> 03:31:48,960
Mint begging for a life.

6975
03:31:49,300 --> 03:31:49,900
Mint begging for a life.

6976
03:31:50,400 --> 03:31:51,200
Mint begging for a life.

6977
03:31:51,200 --> 03:31:51,740
Mint begging for a life.

6978
03:31:52,820 --> 03:31:53,780
Door, stop!

6979
03:31:55,420 --> 03:31:56,380
Door, stop!

6980
03:31:56,920 --> 03:31:57,900
Door, stop!

6981
03:31:59,320 --> 03:32:02,300
Line, that one was unavoidable.

6982
03:32:02,820 --> 03:32:03,980
That one was rough.

6983
03:32:04,080 --> 03:32:05,500
That one was pretty rough.

6984
03:32:05,700 --> 03:32:06,380
I'm here.

6985
03:32:06,480 --> 03:32:07,760
This is as far as I can go.

6986
03:32:08,580 --> 03:32:09,060
Moving?

6987
03:32:09,320 --> 03:32:09,620
Yay!

6988
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:13,120
There's only one spot here, so don't come over here.

6989
03:32:16,320 --> 03:32:16,800
No!

6990
03:32:16,800 --> 03:32:18,420
There was a fucking thread!

6991
03:32:19,060 --> 03:32:19,480
No!

6992
03:32:20,040 --> 03:32:22,100
I was not used to threading the needle.

6993
03:32:22,180 --> 03:32:23,280
It was never my job.

6994
03:32:24,400 --> 03:32:26,440
Spread it out, spread it out.

6995
03:32:26,660 --> 03:32:27,460
We good, we good.

6996
03:32:28,500 --> 03:32:29,240
Okay, nice.

6997
03:32:29,500 --> 03:32:31,200
Nice, nice, nice.

6998
03:32:31,520 --> 03:32:33,560
Can I have a little bit of space here, perhaps?

6999
03:32:35,300 --> 03:32:35,800
Okay.

7000
03:32:36,440 --> 03:32:37,160
Okay, man.

7001
03:32:37,440 --> 03:32:39,500
Move left, right.

7002
03:32:41,740 --> 03:32:43,020
That was close.

7003
03:32:43,820 --> 03:32:46,080
We don't have to come over here, guys.

7004
03:32:48,820 --> 03:32:49,300
Guys!

7005
03:32:55,140 --> 03:32:57,260
Why is it 30 seconds?

7006
03:32:57,820 --> 03:32:58,340
Thank you.

7007
03:32:58,700 --> 03:32:59,980
We almost did it.

7008
03:33:00,020 --> 03:33:00,680
We can do this.

7009
03:33:00,860 --> 03:33:01,980
We were so close, yeah.

7010
03:33:02,660 --> 03:33:05,160
Our reflexes are improving the longer we play.

7011
03:33:06,060 --> 03:33:06,680
Are they?

7012
03:33:07,140 --> 03:33:08,080
Yeah, yeah.

7013
03:33:08,460 --> 03:33:10,020
I feel like it's like a tango.

7014
03:33:10,060 --> 03:33:14,100
We both go opposite ways, and then we embrace each other.

7015
03:33:14,200 --> 03:33:15,420
Yeah, it's kind of awesome.

7016
03:33:15,420 --> 03:33:16,880
Okay, let's all go to the right.

7017
03:33:17,120 --> 03:33:18,800
You can double stack now.

7018
03:33:18,940 --> 03:33:19,620
You can double stack.

7019
03:33:19,900 --> 03:33:20,020
Oh.

7020
03:33:22,280 --> 03:33:25,560
Yeah, the laser just fucked off.

7021
03:33:25,600 --> 03:33:26,800
So you can double stack there.

7022
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:28,400
I know.

7023
03:33:28,420 --> 03:33:31,000
I jumped off somebody's head, but then I just fucked off myself anyway.

7024
03:33:31,500 --> 03:33:32,440
We're gonna die.

7025
03:33:33,500 --> 03:33:34,360
In a second.

7026
03:33:35,880 --> 03:33:39,400
You need to move to the sides more, because sometimes there's just not enough room there.

7027
03:33:39,640 --> 03:33:40,420
Go, go, go.

7028
03:33:40,540 --> 03:33:41,700
Thank you.

7029
03:33:45,420 --> 03:33:45,760
Hi, Doki.

7030
03:33:48,040 --> 03:33:48,560
You.

7031
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:50,940
You.

7032
03:33:52,300 --> 03:33:53,160
Oh, okay.

7033
03:33:53,540 --> 03:33:54,600
Okay, this is safe.

7034
03:33:54,620 --> 03:33:56,160
I feel so safe here.

7035
03:33:57,000 --> 03:33:58,420
I feel so safe.

7036
03:33:59,560 --> 03:34:00,460
Moving left.

7037
03:34:00,600 --> 03:34:01,440
Nice, nice, nice.

7038
03:34:01,960 --> 03:34:06,540
I think the next one is when the...

7039
03:34:06,540 --> 03:34:08,060
Wow, please, a little to the left.

7040
03:34:08,060 --> 03:34:09,260
...is when the line disappears, right?

7041
03:34:09,400 --> 03:34:09,680
I can't, I can't.

7042
03:34:11,000 --> 03:34:11,520
Okay.

7043
03:34:11,860 --> 03:34:12,680
I'm sorry.

7044
03:34:15,420 --> 03:34:16,000
I don't know where to go.

7045
03:34:17,760 --> 03:34:19,200
Doki's fat ass.

7046
03:34:19,760 --> 03:34:20,520
Fat ass.

7047
03:34:20,560 --> 03:34:21,500
Scoot over a little bit, Doki.

7048
03:34:21,620 --> 03:34:21,820
There we go.

7049
03:34:22,300 --> 03:34:22,760
No!

7050
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:25,840
Once again, her fat ass.

7051
03:34:26,320 --> 03:34:27,180
Once again.

7052
03:34:32,920 --> 03:34:34,640
I don't think we should all...

7053
03:34:34,640 --> 03:34:35,500
Okay, that's fine.

7054
03:34:35,660 --> 03:34:36,320
Oh, thank god.

7055
03:34:36,880 --> 03:34:38,020
There's more space to the left.

7056
03:34:38,120 --> 03:34:39,460
There's so much space to the left.

7057
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:41,240
Please, back up over here!

7058
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:43,280
Okay, nice.

7059
03:34:43,280 --> 03:34:45,400
There's a lot of...

7060
03:34:45,420 --> 03:34:45,880
We're here still again.

7061
03:34:46,500 --> 03:34:48,100
We're good, we're good, we're good.

7062
03:34:48,940 --> 03:34:49,420
Okay.

7063
03:34:50,460 --> 03:34:52,260
Let me stack, let me stack!

7064
03:34:53,240 --> 03:34:54,320
It's up to you, Belle.

7065
03:34:58,620 --> 03:34:59,960
Make room, make room!

7066
03:35:00,300 --> 03:35:00,940
Make room, make room!

7067
03:35:01,180 --> 03:35:02,060
It's up to you.

7068
03:35:02,960 --> 03:35:04,240
We're okay, we're okay!

7069
03:35:05,240 --> 03:35:06,360
No one's moving.

7070
03:35:06,680 --> 03:35:07,040
Someone's stuck!

7071
03:35:07,160 --> 03:35:07,420
No!

7072
03:35:08,920 --> 03:35:09,400
No!

7073
03:35:09,400 --> 03:35:09,600
Oh my god.

7074
03:35:10,520 --> 03:35:11,140
No!

7075
03:35:11,900 --> 03:35:12,820
We had it!

7076
03:35:13,080 --> 03:35:14,520
We had it!

7077
03:35:16,000 --> 03:35:17,360
The last one!

7078
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:22,460
We had it!

7079
03:35:26,620 --> 03:35:28,720
It forces you to stack.

7080
03:35:28,900 --> 03:35:29,520
It forces you.

7081
03:35:29,840 --> 03:35:31,880
Left please, left please, left please!

7082
03:35:32,100 --> 03:35:32,460
Thank you.

7083
03:35:33,300 --> 03:35:33,920
Oh!

7084
03:35:34,780 --> 03:35:36,060
Please make room!

7085
03:35:36,060 --> 03:35:36,700
Please make room!

7086
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:39,780
Not like this!

7087
03:35:40,400 --> 03:35:42,120
Not like this!

7088
03:35:42,440 --> 03:35:42,780
Belle!

7089
03:35:43,480 --> 03:35:43,920
Belle!

7090
03:35:45,560 --> 03:35:46,840
Thank you.

7091
03:35:48,320 --> 03:35:49,560
I'm moving right.

7092
03:35:49,780 --> 03:35:51,380
We can fit three there if you scoot.

7093
03:35:51,480 --> 03:35:52,260
Thank you.

7094
03:35:52,480 --> 03:35:55,520
Oh my god, Juniper!

7095
03:35:55,780 --> 03:35:56,420
Juniper!

7096
03:35:56,580 --> 03:35:57,140
I'm gonna die.

7097
03:35:57,760 --> 03:35:59,940
Don't say that!

7098
03:36:00,460 --> 03:36:01,360
I'm stacking!

7099
03:36:01,580 --> 03:36:01,900
I'm stacking!

7100
03:36:04,100 --> 03:36:04,700
I'm stacking!

7101
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:08,340
Why did you move?

7102
03:36:08,980 --> 03:36:10,540
You're saving your life!

7103
03:36:10,800 --> 03:36:12,060
I didn't trust you.

7104
03:36:12,080 --> 03:36:13,220
I didn't trust you.

7105
03:36:13,780 --> 03:36:16,380
Sorry, I didn't trust the process!

7106
03:36:16,800 --> 03:36:17,400
It's okay.

7107
03:36:18,880 --> 03:36:19,480
Amma?

7108
03:36:19,480 --> 03:36:20,080
Amma?

7109
03:36:20,280 --> 03:36:20,720
Yeah?

7110
03:36:20,920 --> 03:36:21,160
Yeah?

7111
03:36:21,560 --> 03:36:30,600
Oh my god, that was an amazing scream.

7112
03:36:30,900 --> 03:36:31,600
Thank you.

7113
03:36:33,380 --> 03:36:33,900
Stacking!

7114
03:36:34,520 --> 03:36:38,980
You don't have to stack, but if it's necessary, then you gotta be ready for it.

7115
03:36:39,040 --> 03:36:39,060
It's necessary.

7116
03:36:39,180 --> 03:36:40,660
I don't wanna play anymore.

7117
03:36:41,220 --> 03:36:42,180
I don't wanna...

7118
03:36:42,180 --> 03:36:43,800
My passenger princess!

7119
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:45,060
My passenger princess!

7120
03:36:46,320 --> 03:36:47,380
Okay, okay, stacking!

7121
03:36:50,460 --> 03:36:51,580
Don't get in a line!

7122
03:36:51,720 --> 03:36:52,240
Get in a line!

7123
03:37:04,150 --> 03:37:04,890
Let's go!

7124
03:37:10,470 --> 03:37:11,450
How much more?

7125
03:37:11,490 --> 03:37:12,250
We have one...

7126
03:37:12,250 --> 03:37:13,530
Oh, we have two left, guys.

7127
03:37:13,950 --> 03:37:15,270
Guys, we have two left.

7128
03:37:15,590 --> 03:37:16,670
We might as well finish.

7129
03:37:17,630 --> 03:37:19,250
Okay, hold on.

7130
03:37:19,390 --> 03:37:20,730
Let me change my stream.

7131
03:37:23,970 --> 03:37:26,050
What the fuck?

7132
03:37:26,470 --> 03:37:27,890
I think we jump all together.

7133
03:37:29,170 --> 03:37:30,470
We're going on a...

7134
03:37:35,150 --> 03:37:38,770
I think whoever gets highlighted is the people who can jump.

7135
03:37:38,890 --> 03:37:40,810
And then some of us are darkened and sleeping.

7136
03:37:41,110 --> 03:37:41,390
See?

7137
03:37:42,250 --> 03:37:43,250
Some of us have, like, closed eyes.

7138
03:37:43,370 --> 03:37:46,170
So I think those who are light up have to jump.

7139
03:37:46,390 --> 03:37:47,270
I'm jumping.

7140
03:37:47,430 --> 03:37:47,810
Me too!

7141
03:37:47,950 --> 03:37:48,970
I'm jumping so much!

7142
03:37:49,150 --> 03:37:50,510
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!

7143
03:37:51,190 --> 03:37:51,930
Jump, jump!

7144
03:37:52,010 --> 03:37:54,190
What the fuck?

7145
03:37:54,910 --> 03:37:56,730
Why do we suck at jumping?

7146
03:37:56,910 --> 03:37:58,210
I swear I'm spamming this shit.

7147
03:37:58,650 --> 03:37:59,750
The Battle Boss!

7148
03:38:01,070 --> 03:38:03,370
And it switches, so you gotta pay attention.

7149
03:38:03,370 --> 03:38:04,950
I think you just have to mash jump, honestly.

7150
03:38:06,530 --> 03:38:08,290
Is there a quiz called that?

7151
03:38:08,290 --> 03:38:11,210
Or is it, like, Flappy Bird and we're just keeping ourselves afloat?

7152
03:38:11,210 --> 03:38:11,730
I think that's highlighted.

7153
03:38:11,730 --> 03:38:12,810
Mash is the fuck out of jump.

7154
03:38:12,890 --> 03:38:13,550
Do we keep going up?

7155
03:38:13,630 --> 03:38:13,910
We do.

7156
03:38:14,050 --> 03:38:15,910
Okay, so just mash the shit out of it.

7157
03:38:16,010 --> 03:38:16,130
Mash!

7158
03:38:16,130 --> 03:38:16,750
Oh, I don't know.

7159
03:38:16,810 --> 03:38:17,770
I think it's gotta be in sync.

7160
03:38:18,750 --> 03:38:19,250
That sounds cool.

7161
03:38:19,490 --> 03:38:19,810
No.

7162
03:38:19,950 --> 03:38:20,850
No, no, no, no, no!

7163
03:38:20,890 --> 03:38:22,510
We can literally mash!

7164
03:38:22,550 --> 03:38:23,050
I don't think...

7165
03:38:23,050 --> 03:38:24,670
I don't think we can stay up.

7166
03:38:24,670 --> 03:38:24,990
I don't know.

7167
03:38:25,010 --> 03:38:27,530
Maybe it's just deceptive because we do have, like, four jumps, technically.

7168
03:38:27,670 --> 03:38:28,010
That's true.

7169
03:38:28,010 --> 03:38:28,550
That's true.

7170
03:38:28,610 --> 03:38:29,170
But I don't think we do.

7171
03:38:31,410 --> 03:38:31,730
Okay.

7172
03:38:31,850 --> 03:38:32,650
Your turn, guys.

7173
03:38:32,650 --> 03:38:33,170
So we use this knowledge.

7174
03:38:37,690 --> 03:38:38,330
Knowledge used!

7175
03:38:39,490 --> 03:38:39,810
Knowledge!

7176
03:38:40,030 --> 03:38:40,250
Knowledge!

7177
03:38:40,250 --> 03:38:40,510
I'm going!

7178
03:38:40,530 --> 03:38:40,810
I'm going!

7179
03:38:40,850 --> 03:38:41,170
I'm going!

7180
03:38:41,170 --> 03:38:41,190
I'm going!

7181
03:38:42,910 --> 03:38:43,390
Hello?

7182
03:38:43,850 --> 03:38:44,330
Hello?

7183
03:38:45,090 --> 03:38:45,570
Hello?

7184
03:38:45,570 --> 03:38:45,810
Hello?

7185
03:38:45,990 --> 03:38:46,470
Hello?

7186
03:38:46,710 --> 03:38:46,730
Hello?

7187
03:38:46,730 --> 03:38:46,850
Hello?

7188
03:38:46,850 --> 03:38:47,030
Hello?

7189
03:38:47,030 --> 03:38:47,170
Hello?

7190
03:38:47,170 --> 03:38:47,230
Hello?

7191
03:38:47,230 --> 03:38:49,070
I will stop this car, I swear to God.

7192
03:38:49,350 --> 03:38:50,670
I will turn around!

7193
03:38:51,490 --> 03:38:52,270
Right now!

7194
03:38:54,250 --> 03:38:55,210
Oh, please.

7195
03:38:58,570 --> 03:39:00,090
Get us out of here.

7196
03:39:01,030 --> 03:39:03,330
This is the definition of, like, backseat driving.

7197
03:39:05,050 --> 03:39:06,730
I don't even know, bro.

7198
03:39:06,810 --> 03:39:06,830
Backseat!

7199
03:39:06,830 --> 03:39:07,490
What's happening?!

7200
03:39:07,490 --> 03:39:08,550
I don't even know...

7201
03:39:09,030 --> 03:39:10,410
You could do everything right.

7202
03:39:10,690 --> 03:39:11,170
What?

7203
03:39:19,030 --> 03:39:25,070
I think you guys have to land and then get your jumps back on that platform and then jump again.

7204
03:39:25,310 --> 03:39:30,070
Yeah, you can only jump once, I see, because your eyes closed.

7205
03:39:32,190 --> 03:39:32,950
Oh, nice!

7206
03:39:34,050 --> 03:39:34,530
Nice!

7207
03:39:35,090 --> 03:39:35,710
Let it land.

7208
03:39:35,730 --> 03:39:36,350
No, no, no!

7209
03:39:36,350 --> 03:39:36,510
Yes!

7210
03:39:36,590 --> 03:39:37,070
No!

7211
03:39:37,510 --> 03:39:39,030
We had new jumping!

7212
03:39:39,470 --> 03:39:41,150
We just gotta let it fall!

7213
03:39:41,190 --> 03:39:41,870
Let it fall!

7214
03:39:41,970 --> 03:39:42,650
We have to stop!

7215
03:39:42,650 --> 03:39:43,530
Let it fall!

7216
03:39:43,590 --> 03:39:44,090
Let it fall!

7217
03:39:45,210 --> 03:39:46,350
Let it snow!

7218
03:39:49,330 --> 03:39:49,810
No!

7219
03:39:50,930 --> 03:39:51,790
Very nice.

7220
03:39:52,070 --> 03:39:52,530
Yeah.

7221
03:39:54,510 --> 03:39:54,990
Hooray.

7222
03:39:55,250 --> 03:39:56,090
We got this.

7223
03:39:56,090 --> 03:39:56,610
Are we there yet?

7224
03:39:57,090 --> 03:39:57,570
Yes, yes.

7225
03:39:57,570 --> 03:39:58,590
Are we there yet, guys?

7226
03:39:59,230 --> 03:39:59,710
No.

7227
03:40:01,490 --> 03:40:02,630
Okay, your turn, guys.

7228
03:40:02,730 --> 03:40:03,450
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

7229
03:40:04,330 --> 03:40:05,410
Team B, go!

7230
03:40:05,710 --> 03:40:05,950
Nice.

7231
03:40:12,150 --> 03:40:13,430
Okay, jump, jump, jump.

7232
03:40:14,750 --> 03:40:15,270
Jump, jump, jump.

7233
03:40:16,430 --> 03:40:17,170
Jump, jump, jump.

7234
03:40:17,170 --> 03:40:18,250
Jump, jump, jump!

7235
03:40:18,710 --> 03:40:22,560
Yeah, it's good!

7236
03:40:22,680 --> 03:40:22,960
It's good!

7237
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:23,760
We got so far!

7238
03:40:23,800 --> 03:40:25,280
That was so cool!

7239
03:40:25,600 --> 03:40:25,960
No!

7240
03:40:25,960 --> 03:40:26,980
This is so cool.

7241
03:40:27,020 --> 03:40:28,400
Why is this so long?

7242
03:40:28,740 --> 03:40:29,440
I know.

7243
03:40:31,140 --> 03:40:31,660
Okay.

7244
03:40:32,160 --> 03:40:33,180
Do-do, do-do.

7245
03:40:33,780 --> 03:40:35,180
I am a little flappy bird.

7246
03:40:35,640 --> 03:40:36,160
Okay.

7247
03:40:38,260 --> 03:40:39,800
What am I doing

7248
03:40:48,100 --> 03:40:49,340
Why can't we go?

7249
03:40:49,660 --> 03:40:50,980
Stop jumping!

7250
03:40:51,240 --> 03:40:52,500
Someone's not jumping!

7251
03:40:52,840 --> 03:40:53,840
Min, are you jumping?

7252
03:40:54,140 --> 03:40:55,600
I am jumping!

7253
03:40:55,840 --> 03:40:57,360
I didn't see your eyes closed.

7254
03:40:57,400 --> 03:41:00,440
Target them and make fun of them based on if their eyes are open or closed.

7255
03:41:00,480 --> 03:41:01,500
That's how you know if they're gaming.

7256
03:41:01,620 --> 03:41:04,120
Yeah, I saw Min's eyes wide open.

7257
03:41:04,720 --> 03:41:06,200
I was jumping!

7258
03:41:06,720 --> 03:41:08,080
Your eyes were closed!

7259
03:41:08,080 --> 03:41:08,940
What do you even know?

7260
03:41:08,960 --> 03:41:09,800
You can't even see!

7261
03:41:10,960 --> 03:41:12,320
I am jumping!

7262
03:41:12,960 --> 03:41:14,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7263
03:41:15,860 --> 03:41:17,200
Yeah, I saw those eyes.

7264
03:41:17,240 --> 03:41:18,840
You saw those eyes, right?

7265
03:41:18,920 --> 03:41:19,940
Look at my eyes.

7266
03:41:20,000 --> 03:41:21,120
My eyes are closing right now.

7267
03:41:22,820 --> 03:41:24,340
That means you don't even know.

7268
03:41:24,740 --> 03:41:26,400
Somebody's eyes are not closing.

7269
03:41:26,420 --> 03:41:27,600
Are we looking at the same?

7270
03:41:27,680 --> 03:41:29,220
Yeah, you see that closing?

7271
03:41:29,460 --> 03:41:29,700
Of course!

7272
03:41:30,160 --> 03:41:31,800
I didn't see them without washing.

7273
03:41:31,940 --> 03:41:32,940
Come on!

7274
03:41:32,980 --> 03:41:34,300
I know what's happening!

7275
03:41:35,200 --> 03:41:36,220
I don't know!

7276
03:41:36,740 --> 03:41:38,940
The colors don't look the same!

7277
03:41:41,570 --> 03:41:41,970
The colors don't look the same!

7278
03:41:44,550 --> 03:41:45,150
Alright.

7279
03:41:45,690 --> 03:41:47,010
It's all up to you guys.

7280
03:41:47,110 --> 03:41:47,210
Oh!

7281
03:41:47,330 --> 03:41:47,690
Oh!

7282
03:41:47,890 --> 03:41:48,130
Oh!

7283
03:41:48,310 --> 03:41:49,990
Whose eyes were open?

7284
03:41:53,740 --> 03:41:54,340
Highlighted!

7285
03:41:58,420 --> 03:41:59,840
Who's clicking the screen?

7286
03:42:02,000 --> 03:42:03,240
That's making it...

7287
03:42:03,240 --> 03:42:04,660
That makes us go faster.

7288
03:42:07,660 --> 03:42:09,140
Here we go.

7289
03:42:10,100 --> 03:42:11,660
I believe in us.

7290
03:42:11,980 --> 03:42:14,160
Oh, now you closed the eyes.

7291
03:42:15,820 --> 03:42:17,040
I did not see!

7292
03:42:17,240 --> 03:42:17,920
I did not see!

7293
03:42:21,320 --> 03:42:21,800
Jump!

7294
03:42:22,040 --> 03:42:22,400
Jump!

7295
03:42:24,200 --> 03:42:24,680
Jump!

7296
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:26,400
Jump!

7297
03:42:26,400 --> 03:42:26,600
Jump around!

7298
03:42:27,020 --> 03:42:27,520
Jump around!

7299
03:42:27,780 --> 03:42:27,860
Jump!

7300
03:42:27,880 --> 03:42:27,960
Jump!

7301
03:42:28,280 --> 03:42:28,700
Jump!

7302
03:42:29,760 --> 03:42:30,820
Okay, okay, okay.

7303
03:42:30,860 --> 03:42:31,020
We're good.

7304
03:42:31,680 --> 03:42:32,160
Nice!

7305
03:42:32,240 --> 03:42:32,660
No jump!

7306
03:42:33,380 --> 03:42:33,860
Falling!

7307
03:42:33,860 --> 03:42:34,280
Falling!

7308
03:42:34,380 --> 03:42:34,860
Hopping!

7309
03:42:35,040 --> 03:42:35,960
Hop, hop, hop!

7310
03:42:36,180 --> 03:42:36,960
Hop, hop, hop!

7311
03:42:37,360 --> 03:42:37,840
Nice!

7312
03:42:37,860 --> 03:42:38,260
Falling!

7313
03:42:38,260 --> 03:42:38,700
Hop, hop, hop!

7314
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:39,480
Oh, no!

7315
03:42:43,020 --> 03:42:43,580
Let's go!

7316
03:42:43,880 --> 03:42:45,360
I need no way, bro!

7317
03:42:45,440 --> 03:42:47,440
I need no way!

7318
03:42:47,460 --> 03:42:48,060
No way!

7319
03:42:48,060 --> 03:42:48,920
How do we die now?

7320
03:42:48,920 --> 03:42:49,500
Wait!

7321
03:42:49,720 --> 03:42:50,680
How do we die?

7322
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:51,920
We are retried!

7323
03:42:53,100 --> 03:42:54,080
Where's the key, guys?

7324
03:42:54,520 --> 03:42:54,920
Guys?

7325
03:42:55,460 --> 03:42:56,140
What happened?

7326
03:42:56,280 --> 03:42:56,780
Where's the key?

7327
03:42:56,780 --> 03:42:57,480
What happened?

7328
03:42:58,360 --> 03:42:59,580
Who dropped the key?

7329
03:42:59,780 --> 03:43:00,560
Where's the key?

7330
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:01,160
Where's the key?

7331
03:43:01,360 --> 03:43:01,520
Yeah.

7332
03:43:04,900 --> 03:43:05,300
Okay.

7333
03:43:05,460 --> 03:43:05,960
It's okay.

7334
03:43:06,100 --> 03:43:06,460
We learn.

7335
03:43:06,600 --> 03:43:06,940
We learn.

7336
03:43:07,080 --> 03:43:07,520
We're learning.

7337
03:43:07,860 --> 03:43:11,640
Two people, like, have to use theirs, and then the other two uses theirs.

7338
03:43:13,420 --> 03:43:13,820
Nice!

7339
03:43:14,180 --> 03:43:14,920
Very good!

7340
03:43:15,100 --> 03:43:15,460
There we go!

7341
03:43:15,600 --> 03:43:16,160
Don't jump!

7342
03:43:16,260 --> 03:43:16,480
Don't jump!

7343
03:43:16,480 --> 03:43:16,640
Don't jump!

7344
03:43:16,740 --> 03:43:17,140
Yeah!

7345
03:43:17,180 --> 03:43:18,160
Oh, thank God!

7346
03:43:18,380 --> 03:43:18,760
Yeah!

7347
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:18,900
Yeah!

7348
03:43:18,900 --> 03:43:19,640
Oh, my God!

7349
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:20,260
Beep!

7350
03:43:20,260 --> 03:43:20,580
Beep!

7351
03:43:20,580 --> 03:43:20,660
Beep!

7352
03:43:20,720 --> 03:43:21,300
Beep!

7353
03:43:22,000 --> 03:43:25,400
All right.

7354
03:43:25,860 --> 03:43:26,240
Nice.

7355
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:27,660
We did it.

7356
03:43:27,780 --> 03:43:28,760
I'm so proud.

7357
03:43:28,820 --> 03:43:30,920
We got our driver's license, guys.

7358
03:43:32,160 --> 03:43:32,740
Yay!

7359
03:43:33,520 --> 03:43:35,160
We got a parallel pipe.

7360
03:43:35,660 --> 03:43:35,840
Yay!

7361
03:43:36,300 --> 03:43:37,340
Parallel park.

7362
03:43:37,420 --> 03:43:38,960
The seven of us.

7363
03:43:40,500 --> 03:43:42,880
That's like, it's like there's, oh no!

7364
03:43:43,560 --> 03:43:45,920
Oh, this is PTSD.

7365
03:43:46,580 --> 03:43:47,180
I'm gonna do it!

7366
03:43:47,180 --> 03:43:47,400
Fuck.

7367
03:43:47,800 --> 03:43:48,380
Ew.

7368
03:43:48,400 --> 03:43:48,880
Ew.

7369
03:43:50,120 --> 03:43:51,400
We know what it does.

7370
03:43:52,140 --> 03:43:54,180
Oh, I definitely know what that does.

7371
03:43:54,440 --> 03:43:56,140
You don't know what it does!

7372
03:43:56,200 --> 03:43:57,240
It says don't press it!

7373
03:43:57,600 --> 03:44:01,340
That's exactly what you say if that was gonna shower somebody with infinite riches.

7374
03:44:01,760 --> 03:44:02,260
That's true.

7375
03:44:02,500 --> 03:44:02,880
No!

7376
03:44:04,620 --> 03:44:06,300
Don't press this, it would give you money.

7377
03:44:08,460 --> 03:44:11,440
Okay, five, four, three...

7378
03:44:11,440 --> 03:44:13,460
Guys, you guys can keep going.

7379
03:44:13,740 --> 03:44:15,200
I don't think we can stay.

7380
03:44:15,260 --> 03:44:16,240
This has to be sex.

7381
03:44:18,880 --> 03:44:20,820
Who goes on the bottom there, like in this little hole?

7382
03:44:21,060 --> 03:44:22,740
Anybody go on that hole down there?

7383
03:44:22,820 --> 03:44:23,240
You guys?

7384
03:44:25,480 --> 03:44:27,160
The little hole down here.

7385
03:44:30,460 --> 03:44:31,720
Oh, it just keeps going!

7386
03:44:31,920 --> 03:44:32,560
It just keeps going!

7387
03:44:34,820 --> 03:44:36,300
Alright, just keep moving, guys.

7388
03:44:36,420 --> 03:44:36,900
Keep moving.

7389
03:44:37,040 --> 03:44:38,360
The screen's gonna eat us.

7390
03:44:38,720 --> 03:44:42,420
You guys, last time I played with my friends, Chaz called this my waterloo.

7391
03:44:43,320 --> 03:44:44,200
Oh, no!

7392
03:44:45,120 --> 03:44:46,180
What's a waterloo?

7393
03:44:46,320 --> 03:44:48,140
We'd be like all the way, bro.

7394
03:44:48,900 --> 03:44:50,020
How do we do this?

7395
03:44:50,160 --> 03:44:51,800
Do we just keep stacking over here?

7396
03:44:52,700 --> 03:44:53,420
I don't know.

7397
03:44:53,480 --> 03:44:53,820
Oh, yeah.

7398
03:44:54,040 --> 03:44:54,700
Yeah, stack.

7399
03:44:54,820 --> 03:44:55,680
Stack as much as you can.

7400
03:44:56,260 --> 03:44:56,660
So...

7401
03:44:56,660 --> 03:44:56,820
What?

7402
03:44:59,420 --> 03:45:00,260
Why are we stacking?

7403
03:45:00,500 --> 03:45:01,960
I don't know why we're stacking.

7404
03:45:01,960 --> 03:45:02,280
Go!

7405
03:45:02,360 --> 03:45:02,360
Go!

7406
03:45:03,480 --> 03:45:03,880
Guys?

7407
03:45:06,240 --> 03:45:06,640
Goodbye.

7408
03:45:07,320 --> 03:45:07,720
Goodbye.

7409
03:45:07,800 --> 03:45:08,160
Goodbye.

7410
03:45:08,320 --> 03:45:10,000
We have to stack all the way up.

7411
03:45:10,020 --> 03:45:12,340
We have to stack and then just keep going down.

7412
03:45:12,440 --> 03:45:12,840
Keep going.

7413
03:45:13,200 --> 03:45:15,620
Yeah, because once someone jumps off, it starts moving...

7414
03:45:15,620 --> 03:45:15,880
Okay, that makes sense.

7415
03:45:15,880 --> 03:45:15,880
Yeah.

7416
03:45:15,900 --> 03:45:16,640
...moves back up.

7417
03:45:16,760 --> 03:45:17,280
Yeah, yeah.

7418
03:45:17,280 --> 03:45:17,660
Yeah, yeah.

7419
03:45:17,920 --> 03:45:18,220
Oh!

7420
03:45:18,900 --> 03:45:21,260
So how come you think they left a death button there?

7421
03:45:21,280 --> 03:45:23,060
That's totally gonna be relevant later, right?

7422
03:45:23,240 --> 03:45:24,160
Yeah, I think that's good.

7423
03:45:24,340 --> 03:45:25,420
No, it's definitely...

7424
03:45:26,140 --> 03:45:26,920
Alright, stack.

7425
03:45:28,220 --> 03:45:30,420
Stack and then we're gonna go down to the bottom, right?

7426
03:45:30,560 --> 03:45:31,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7427
03:45:31,400 --> 03:45:31,620
Drop.

7428
03:45:32,640 --> 03:45:34,220
How much can we stack?

7429
03:45:34,400 --> 03:45:35,400
I don't think you want four.

7430
03:45:36,980 --> 03:45:37,840
Just keep going.

7431
03:45:37,940 --> 03:45:38,620
Just let it go.

7432
03:45:38,920 --> 03:45:39,320
Go?

7433
03:45:40,300 --> 03:45:41,000
Someone's gotta go.

7434
03:45:41,220 --> 03:45:41,620
Emily.

7435
03:45:42,560 --> 03:45:43,360
Okay, now...

7436
03:45:43,360 --> 03:45:44,100
That's it.

7437
03:45:44,600 --> 03:45:45,000
Goodbye.

7438
03:45:45,620 --> 03:45:46,200
That's it.

7439
03:45:46,200 --> 03:45:46,840
That's it.

7440
03:45:46,900 --> 03:45:47,460
That's it.

7441
03:45:47,540 --> 03:45:47,940
You get...

7442
03:45:47,940 --> 03:45:48,240
Oh!

7443
03:45:48,600 --> 03:45:50,540
You don't die when you jump off it!

7444
03:45:50,940 --> 03:45:51,460
Oh!

7445
03:45:51,480 --> 03:45:54,420
Oh, so we can put someone over there and then...

7446
03:45:54,420 --> 03:45:57,340
We would never put a tiny little hole there if it wasn't meant for something.

7447
03:45:57,580 --> 03:45:58,140
Yeah, I think...

7448
03:45:58,140 --> 03:45:58,300
Okay.

7449
03:45:58,540 --> 03:46:00,280
Okay, who jumped on top of...

7450
03:46:00,280 --> 03:46:01,220
Alright.

7451
03:46:01,500 --> 03:46:02,020
Alright.

7452
03:46:02,440 --> 03:46:02,880
Oh, no.

7453
03:46:02,880 --> 03:46:05,260
Who boosted me into that button?

7454
03:46:08,520 --> 03:46:10,120
You can't push people.

7455
03:46:11,780 --> 03:46:12,680
Oh, no.

7456
03:46:12,680 --> 03:46:13,460
Oh, no.

7457
03:46:13,560 --> 03:46:14,100
Oh, no.

7458
03:46:14,300 --> 03:46:14,820
Oh, no.

7459
03:46:15,040 --> 03:46:15,320
Oh, no.

7460
03:46:15,420 --> 03:46:15,860
Oh, no.

7461
03:46:15,860 --> 03:46:16,120
Oh, no.

7462
03:46:16,120 --> 03:46:16,180
Oh, no.

7463
03:46:16,180 --> 03:46:16,220
Let's find the bottom.

7464
03:46:16,220 --> 03:46:17,180
Du du du du du du.

7465
03:46:17,180 --> 03:46:18,460
Please let it end.

7466
03:46:19,320 --> 03:46:19,840
Please let it end.

7467
03:46:19,840 --> 03:46:21,260
So should I go as the bottom person?

7468
03:46:21,400 --> 03:46:22,260
Should I go into this little hole?

7469
03:46:22,260 --> 03:46:25,960
I think we should go three stacks of three, and then one person goes in the bottom.

7470
03:46:26,380 --> 03:46:27,740
I shall go into the hole.

7471
03:46:28,480 --> 03:46:29,720
The hole is the goal.

7472
03:46:29,760 --> 03:46:30,300
Here we go!

7473
03:46:30,620 --> 03:46:30,920
The hole is the goal.

7474
03:46:30,920 --> 03:46:31,100
Go in the hole?

7475
03:46:31,460 --> 03:46:32,060
Like that.

7476
03:46:32,180 --> 03:46:33,700
And then I fall out, and then I come back.

7477
03:46:33,780 --> 03:46:34,940
And then we're dead?

7478
03:46:35,880 --> 03:46:37,120
And then we're dead.

7479
03:46:37,340 --> 03:46:37,700
Awww, bye!

7480
03:46:37,700 --> 03:46:38,000
I'm confused.

7481
03:46:38,360 --> 03:46:38,740
Oh, shit.

7482
03:46:41,760 --> 03:46:42,560
Use Bowser!

7483
03:46:42,800 --> 03:46:44,780
Maybe we just have to do the watermill.

7484
03:46:44,820 --> 03:46:44,980
Just like a watermill.

7485
03:46:44,980 --> 03:46:46,140
Just like really smooth side.

7486
03:46:47,860 --> 03:46:50,880
Oh, that was... Wow, clean!

7487
03:46:51,560 --> 03:46:53,340
Thank you very much.

7488
03:46:53,880 --> 03:46:54,760
Nice, nice.

7489
03:46:54,760 --> 03:46:55,380
We all get one.

7490
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:55,960
We all get one.

7491
03:46:56,760 --> 03:46:57,800
When's my turn?

7492
03:46:58,140 --> 03:46:59,340
No, except for you.

7493
03:46:59,760 --> 03:47:00,500
Oh, okay.

7494
03:47:01,020 --> 03:47:02,380
You already had your one.

7495
03:47:02,800 --> 03:47:03,320
Okay.

7496
03:47:05,480 --> 03:47:06,000
Okay.

7497
03:47:11,340 --> 03:47:11,860
Okay.

7498
03:47:13,380 --> 03:47:13,900
Okay.

7499
03:47:13,900 --> 03:47:13,960
Okay.

7500
03:47:13,960 --> 03:47:15,360
One to the top, go.

7501
03:47:15,500 --> 03:47:15,960
Oh, fuck.

7502
03:47:16,060 --> 03:47:16,640
I was too slow.

7503
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:22,020
Wait, can't you guys just fall down the hole and come back?

7504
03:47:22,260 --> 03:47:22,920
Oh, yeah, that's true.

7505
03:47:24,300 --> 03:47:25,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

7506
03:47:25,340 --> 03:47:27,440
We're gonna die, though.

7507
03:47:27,540 --> 03:47:28,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7508
03:47:29,400 --> 03:47:35,720
Well, I guess that just means that even if one person passes, there's still a chance we can save it at the end, I think.

7509
03:47:35,800 --> 03:47:37,760
There has to be a reason why that notch is there.

7510
03:47:37,940 --> 03:47:40,340
Let me, let me, let me use the notch.

7511
03:47:40,660 --> 03:47:41,300
Don't, don't...

7512
03:47:41,980 --> 03:47:43,260
Okay, Val got two.

7513
03:47:45,660 --> 03:47:46,860
That's not fair.

7514
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:47,960
She's not there.

7515
03:47:51,900 --> 03:47:54,020
Three hours into the game, I forgore.

7516
03:47:54,780 --> 03:47:56,260
That happened to me before, too.

7517
03:47:56,900 --> 03:47:58,060
Don't leave the platform.

7518
03:48:00,780 --> 03:48:02,460
Just stay on for a sec.

7519
03:48:02,520 --> 03:48:03,300
I wanna test something.

7520
03:48:03,840 --> 03:48:04,280
Okay.

7521
03:48:05,480 --> 03:48:06,820
Nope, fuck, I fucked it up.

7522
03:48:06,860 --> 03:48:07,300
Hold on.

7523
03:48:07,640 --> 03:48:08,560
Can you come back on?

7524
03:48:08,700 --> 03:48:09,320
Yeah, I'll come back.

7525
03:48:09,900 --> 03:48:10,580
Okay, cool.

7526
03:48:11,180 --> 03:48:12,120
No one move.

7527
03:48:13,960 --> 03:48:14,860
There's nothing between the platform and the hole.

7528
03:48:15,240 --> 03:48:17,440
Oh, like stopping it or something?

7529
03:48:17,760 --> 03:48:20,100
Yeah, yeah, we use our big head to stop it.

7530
03:48:20,320 --> 03:48:21,160
Oh, stop it.

7531
03:48:21,160 --> 03:48:23,520
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna jam your head in there.

7532
03:48:24,300 --> 03:48:27,260
Cause your head's made of solid rock, right?

7533
03:48:27,480 --> 03:48:29,580
It might not be the right way, but god damn it if we aren't using our heads.

7534
03:48:29,940 --> 03:48:31,620
It might not be the right way, but god damn it if we aren't using our heads.

7535
03:48:31,620 --> 03:48:32,580
This is it, Snuffy.

7536
03:48:32,640 --> 03:48:33,900
This is what your head is for.

7537
03:48:36,440 --> 03:48:38,000
Use your head, she said.

7538
03:48:38,080 --> 03:48:38,380
Okay.

7539
03:48:40,700 --> 03:48:42,040
Val, it's up to you now.

7540
03:48:42,040 --> 03:48:43,540
I'm your head.

7541
03:48:44,000 --> 03:48:46,760
Okay, don't worry, this is what my head is for.

7542
03:48:47,080 --> 03:48:47,660
This is what your dent is for.

7543
03:48:47,780 --> 03:48:49,280
Yeah, this is what my dent is.

7544
03:48:49,480 --> 03:48:50,040
Okay, here we go.

7545
03:48:50,420 --> 03:48:51,780
Go, go, go!

7546
03:48:54,260 --> 03:48:55,120
I knew it.

7547
03:48:55,400 --> 03:48:57,900
I knew my head was good for something.

7548
03:48:58,580 --> 03:48:59,820
Now we gotta stack here.

7549
03:48:59,880 --> 03:49:01,680
We gotta stack here our colors, I saw.

7550
03:49:03,960 --> 03:49:04,660
I'm on Amma.

7551
03:49:05,780 --> 03:49:06,840
Orange needs to come up.

7552
03:49:07,020 --> 03:49:08,100
Orange needs to come up.

7553
03:49:08,100 --> 03:49:08,820
Orange needs to come up.

7554
03:49:08,820 --> 03:49:09,620
I can't move.

7555
03:49:12,040 --> 03:49:12,800
Guys, guys.

7556
03:49:13,580 --> 03:49:14,720
Guys, what happened?

7557
03:49:15,020 --> 03:49:17,360
Guys, what happened?

7558
03:49:17,800 --> 03:49:18,600
Oh my god.

7559
03:49:18,920 --> 03:49:19,820
Guys, guys.

7560
03:49:22,080 --> 03:49:23,200
We can't push.

7561
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:29,320
It's okay, we know it's...

7562
03:49:29,920 --> 03:49:31,640
Bro, I'm dead.

7563
03:49:31,820 --> 03:49:33,080
I don't know anymore.

7564
03:49:33,200 --> 03:49:34,100
Bro, I'm dead.

7565
03:49:35,800 --> 03:49:36,960
I won't say anything.

7566
03:49:38,020 --> 03:49:39,360
I'll say something.

7567
03:49:40,300 --> 03:49:41,960
Oh my god, you almost pressed the button.

7568
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:42,420
But it's a five.

7569
03:49:44,860 --> 03:49:45,380
I'll say something.

7570
03:49:46,520 --> 03:49:47,800
Let's keep running, keep going.

7571
03:49:47,800 --> 03:49:48,840
We're running out of order.

7572
03:49:49,180 --> 03:49:50,880
Keep going, keep running.

7573
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:52,360
Alright.

7574
03:49:53,480 --> 03:49:55,200
I'll use that big brain of yours.

7575
03:49:55,460 --> 03:49:55,840
No.

7576
03:49:55,920 --> 03:49:56,440
No.

7577
03:49:56,520 --> 03:50:00,800
I have the experience, guys.

7578
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:01,540
You got it, you got it.

7579
03:50:02,440 --> 03:50:04,200
Alright, everybody go.

7580
03:50:04,580 --> 03:50:05,100
Goodbye.

7581
03:50:07,700 --> 03:50:08,700
Sorry, it was.

7582
03:50:09,220 --> 03:50:10,660
It's a one time use.

7583
03:50:11,040 --> 03:50:14,020
My head is super soft now.

7584
03:50:15,120 --> 03:50:17,780
If only we were like a little slower.

7585
03:50:17,960 --> 03:50:20,280
Are we going to have to staircase those blocks?

7586
03:50:20,460 --> 03:50:21,840
Because we have to climb up to the key.

7587
03:50:22,140 --> 03:50:24,200
Yeah, I think we have to staircase those fucking blocks.

7588
03:50:24,640 --> 03:50:28,240
It's also over a giant ravine of like killing...

7589
03:50:28,240 --> 03:50:29,340
Yeah, yeah.

7590
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:30,680
Is that so?

7591
03:50:32,160 --> 03:50:32,660
Nope.

7592
03:50:33,280 --> 03:50:33,960
Don't jump.

7593
03:50:34,060 --> 03:50:34,320
Don't jump.

7594
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:35,500
Wedge.

7595
03:50:35,500 --> 03:50:35,980
Wedge.

7596
03:50:35,980 --> 03:50:36,400
Wedge.

7597
03:50:36,640 --> 03:50:37,600
It's wedge now.

7598
03:50:37,940 --> 03:50:38,540
Get up.

7599
03:50:38,540 --> 03:50:39,420
Just jump on me.

7600
03:50:39,580 --> 03:50:39,640
Wow.

7601
03:50:39,640 --> 03:50:40,040
You gotta go.

7602
03:50:40,160 --> 03:50:41,120
Thank you.

7603
03:50:43,300 --> 03:50:43,980
Alright, here we go.

7604
03:50:44,540 --> 03:50:45,200
I'm trying to go.

7605
03:50:45,580 --> 03:50:46,340
I'm trying to go.

7606
03:50:46,800 --> 03:50:47,600
I'm trying to go.

7607
03:50:47,980 --> 03:50:49,320
I'm trying to go.

7608
03:50:49,460 --> 03:50:49,720
Okay.

7609
03:50:50,380 --> 03:50:51,480
I'm on top of wedge.

7610
03:50:52,500 --> 03:50:52,820
Grey.

7611
03:50:52,820 --> 03:50:53,140
Grey.

7612
03:50:53,200 --> 03:50:54,220
Grey, blue, orange.

7613
03:50:54,380 --> 03:50:55,100
Grey, blue, orange.

7614
03:50:55,340 --> 03:50:55,640
Yep.

7615
03:50:56,220 --> 03:50:57,600
And then me, me, me, me, me.

7616
03:50:57,640 --> 03:50:58,640
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

7617
03:50:59,480 --> 03:51:00,780
Oh my god, you freaked me out.

7618
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:01,200
Yellow, green.

7619
03:51:01,600 --> 03:51:01,920
Green.

7620
03:51:02,580 --> 03:51:02,900
Red.

7621
03:51:04,480 --> 03:51:04,900
Scoot over.

7622
03:51:05,000 --> 03:51:05,360
Scoot some.

7623
03:51:05,600 --> 03:51:06,040
Scoot some.

7624
03:51:06,160 --> 03:51:06,440
Scoot some.

7625
03:51:06,480 --> 03:51:07,400
Go push, push, push, push.

7626
03:51:07,600 --> 03:51:08,640
Push, push, push, push.

7627
03:51:09,160 --> 03:51:09,640
No!

7628
03:51:10,560 --> 03:51:11,960
We pushed too far.

7629
03:51:13,420 --> 03:51:14,940
Yeah, you gotta make a staircase.

7630
03:51:15,140 --> 03:51:16,060
You don't push it down.

7631
03:51:16,300 --> 03:51:17,380
There's a pink block.

7632
03:51:17,540 --> 03:51:19,420
Despite us not having eight people.

7633
03:51:19,500 --> 03:51:20,220
That's kind of funny.

7634
03:51:21,680 --> 03:51:23,300
I think it's the same order.

7635
03:51:23,400 --> 03:51:24,780
So grey always has to be in front.

7636
03:51:25,460 --> 03:51:25,940
Yeah.

7637
03:51:27,360 --> 03:51:29,680
Because I saw it was the same order.

7638
03:51:29,980 --> 03:51:30,440
Yeah, it was the same order.

7639
03:51:30,440 --> 03:51:31,320
No, I'm not pink.

7640
03:51:31,360 --> 03:51:31,920
I'm not pink.

7641
03:51:31,960 --> 03:51:32,420
I'm purple.

7642
03:51:32,620 --> 03:51:33,080
I'm purple.

7643
03:51:33,720 --> 03:51:34,200
Wow.

7644
03:51:35,480 --> 03:51:35,960
Wow.

7645
03:51:35,960 --> 03:51:38,120
My chat is waving me.

7646
03:51:38,260 --> 03:51:39,240
I'm not doing that.

7647
03:51:39,960 --> 03:51:40,360
Whoa.

7648
03:51:41,420 --> 03:51:42,460
Are you okay?

7649
03:51:45,060 --> 03:51:45,860
Jam successful.

7650
03:51:46,820 --> 03:51:48,040
Grey in front, remember.

7651
03:51:48,260 --> 03:51:48,940
Grey in front.

7652
03:51:49,000 --> 03:51:49,480
Grey in front.

7653
03:51:49,980 --> 03:51:50,480
I'm here.

7654
03:51:50,580 --> 03:51:50,820
I'm here.

7655
03:51:50,840 --> 03:51:51,000
I'm here.

7656
03:51:51,360 --> 03:51:53,260
No, but it's still grey in front.

7657
03:51:53,720 --> 03:51:55,120
Wait, wait, wait.

7658
03:51:55,920 --> 03:51:56,860
Grey push first.

7659
03:51:57,300 --> 03:51:57,780
Grey push first.

7660
03:51:58,120 --> 03:51:58,840
Do it first.

7661
03:51:59,380 --> 03:52:00,140
Don't line up.

7662
03:52:00,200 --> 03:52:00,680
Don't line up.

7663
03:52:02,980 --> 03:52:03,680
I don't...

7664
03:52:04,140 --> 03:52:04,900
But it drops.

7665
03:52:04,940 --> 03:52:05,500
They drop.

7666
03:52:05,580 --> 03:52:05,940
We can't...

7667
03:52:05,960 --> 03:52:06,700
We can't push it too far.

7668
03:52:07,620 --> 03:52:08,340
I can't.

7669
03:52:08,400 --> 03:52:08,720
I can't.

7670
03:52:08,800 --> 03:52:09,480
Don't have room.

7671
03:52:10,460 --> 03:52:12,060
Okay, green, come up.

7672
03:52:12,520 --> 03:52:12,520
Okay.

7673
03:52:13,000 --> 03:52:13,360
Okay.

7674
03:52:13,480 --> 03:52:15,280
You pushed it too far.

7675
03:52:15,680 --> 03:52:16,680
Sorry, that was me.

7676
03:52:16,880 --> 03:52:18,620
I was trying to jump, but I pushed it.

7677
03:52:18,680 --> 03:52:19,020
I'm sorry.

7678
03:52:19,520 --> 03:52:20,100
It's okay.

7679
03:52:22,240 --> 03:52:24,300
Okay, if I'm pink, then what's the top one, huh?

7680
03:52:24,380 --> 03:52:25,020
What's the top one?

7681
03:52:26,560 --> 03:52:27,380
I don't know.

7682
03:52:27,380 --> 03:52:28,540
It looks kind of pink to me.

7683
03:52:32,060 --> 03:52:34,780
It's more pink than purple.

7684
03:52:35,960 --> 03:52:36,640
It's not grey.

7685
03:52:38,040 --> 03:52:39,620
Oh, I have the experience.

7686
03:52:39,620 --> 03:52:40,600
We didn't stack at all.

7687
03:52:40,680 --> 03:52:41,060
That's fine.

7688
03:52:41,720 --> 03:52:42,660
Go, go, go.

7689
03:52:43,320 --> 03:52:43,840
That's fine.

7690
03:52:43,880 --> 03:52:44,660
We don't need the stack.

7691
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:45,680
We just need my big head.

7692
03:52:45,720 --> 03:52:45,880
Go, go, go.

7693
03:52:47,540 --> 03:52:49,100
Where would we be without it?

7694
03:52:50,640 --> 03:52:51,040
Alright.

7695
03:52:51,560 --> 03:52:51,960
Okay.

7696
03:52:52,600 --> 03:52:54,140
Is grey on the bottom again?

7697
03:52:54,560 --> 03:52:55,360
No, it's orange.

7698
03:52:55,440 --> 03:52:55,900
No, it's me.

7699
03:52:56,480 --> 03:52:57,460
Orange, yellow, grey.

7700
03:52:58,820 --> 03:52:59,580
Don't push it too far.

7701
03:52:59,620 --> 03:53:00,120
Don't push it too far.

7702
03:53:00,220 --> 03:53:01,480
I'm pushing it to here.

7703
03:53:01,580 --> 03:53:02,120
I'm blue.

7704
03:53:02,720 --> 03:53:03,120
Okay.

7705
03:53:03,320 --> 03:53:03,720
Purple.

7706
03:53:03,720 --> 03:53:04,400
Snuffy.

7707
03:53:04,500 --> 03:53:04,820
Alright.

7708
03:53:05,380 --> 03:53:06,260
Alright, don't... yeah.

7709
03:53:06,440 --> 03:53:07,840
No more pushing on the bottom.

7710
03:53:08,260 --> 03:53:11,700
Yeah, bottom's gotta jump up before the thing starts pushing you.

7711
03:53:12,220 --> 03:53:13,840
Alright, Doki, start moving.

7712
03:53:14,480 --> 03:53:14,920
Okay.

7713
03:53:15,840 --> 03:53:17,780
Alright, let's start moving.

7714
03:53:17,980 --> 03:53:18,780
Let's start moving.

7715
03:53:20,200 --> 03:53:20,920
Let's start moving.

7716
03:53:21,160 --> 03:53:21,960
Let's start moving.

7717
03:53:22,100 --> 03:53:22,820
Let's start moving, please.

7718
03:53:22,820 --> 03:53:23,640
Let's start moving, please.

7719
03:53:25,280 --> 03:53:25,720
Please.

7720
03:53:26,960 --> 03:53:28,120
Go, jump, jump.

7721
03:53:28,160 --> 03:53:28,760
Go, go, go.

7722
03:53:29,080 --> 03:53:30,820
Go, jump, jump.

7723
03:53:30,820 --> 03:53:30,820
Go, go, go.

7724
03:53:30,820 --> 03:53:33,140
Holy shit.

7725
03:53:33,380 --> 03:53:34,900
That was so close.

7726
03:53:34,980 --> 03:53:36,600
It was like touching your ass.

7727
03:53:36,880 --> 03:53:38,600
There you go.

7728
03:53:38,980 --> 03:53:40,300
Oh my god.

7729
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:44,520
Oh.

7730
03:53:44,580 --> 03:53:46,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7731
03:53:46,460 --> 03:53:47,620
Whoa, chill out.

7732
03:53:47,640 --> 03:53:48,100
Chill out, dude.

7733
03:53:48,540 --> 03:53:50,580
Oh, I don't think... I don't...

7734
03:53:50,580 --> 03:53:52,340
I was not there.

7735
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:53,880
I'm sorry.

7736
03:53:53,980 --> 03:53:56,540
I tried to have one second to take a water.

7737
03:53:56,700 --> 03:53:57,460
How dare you.

7738
03:53:57,620 --> 03:53:58,180
I know.

7739
03:53:58,480 --> 03:53:59,000
Yeah.

7740
03:54:01,180 --> 03:54:03,220
None of us are getting a break.

7741
03:54:03,320 --> 03:54:04,480
You're not getting a break.

7742
03:54:04,960 --> 03:54:05,400
Yeah.

7743
03:54:05,820 --> 03:54:07,820
Watch out here.

7744
03:54:08,020 --> 03:54:08,820
Watch out here.

7745
03:54:08,860 --> 03:54:09,300
Don't move.

7746
03:54:10,200 --> 03:54:10,960
No jumping.

7747
03:54:12,420 --> 03:54:12,860
Okay.

7748
03:54:14,400 --> 03:54:14,840
Interesting.

7749
03:54:14,900 --> 03:54:15,600
We've got some platforms.

7750
03:54:16,260 --> 03:54:16,700
Okay.

7751
03:54:16,880 --> 03:54:18,640
Don't say... Wow, this looks so harmless.

7752
03:54:18,800 --> 03:54:21,160
I think... But no, if everybody gets off, how do we get back?

7753
03:54:21,360 --> 03:54:22,060
It looks so dumb.

7754
03:54:22,240 --> 03:54:22,460
Okay, we might have to back.

7755
03:54:22,720 --> 03:54:24,480
Okay, what if we back together?

7756
03:54:24,800 --> 03:54:25,320
Back, back, back.

7757
03:54:25,320 --> 03:54:26,120
Like, touch each other.

7758
03:54:26,280 --> 03:54:26,540
Back, back.

7759
03:54:26,540 --> 03:54:27,280
What do you mean back?

7760
03:54:28,060 --> 03:54:28,500
Back.

7761
03:54:29,220 --> 03:54:29,940
I'm stacking.

7762
03:54:31,180 --> 03:54:31,980
Oh, stack.

7763
03:54:32,200 --> 03:54:33,040
I thought you were saying back.

7764
03:54:33,860 --> 03:54:35,220
How do we get back?

7765
03:54:35,520 --> 03:54:37,240
We can all jump off, no?

7766
03:54:37,440 --> 03:54:37,940
How do we get back?

7767
03:54:38,340 --> 03:54:40,020
If we all jump off, how do we get back?

7768
03:54:40,340 --> 03:54:44,200
Oh, maybe like at the far right, there might be something that might bring us back.

7769
03:54:44,520 --> 03:54:47,680
Maybe one person has to parkour it.

7770
03:54:48,160 --> 03:54:49,160
I don't think you can.

7771
03:54:49,240 --> 03:54:50,520
I don't think you can, yeah.

7772
03:54:51,700 --> 03:54:52,860
Yeah, it's too far.

7773
03:54:53,080 --> 03:54:56,700
Maybe there's something at the very far back because we didn't explore that far back yet.

7774
03:54:57,020 --> 03:55:00,180
I think we should make a little bit of a bridge and just kind of like maybe peek it.

7775
03:55:00,180 --> 03:55:00,540
Yeah, just see.

7776
03:55:00,580 --> 03:55:00,760
Yeah.

7777
03:55:00,820 --> 03:55:03,140
We won't fall back, but we can just kind of like...

7778
03:55:03,140 --> 03:55:03,720
See what?

7779
03:55:03,820 --> 03:55:04,920
Yeah, there has to be something over there.

7780
03:55:04,980 --> 03:55:05,480
There has to be something.

7781
03:55:05,980 --> 03:55:06,380
Jump!

7782
03:55:09,800 --> 03:55:10,680
We'll never know.

7783
03:55:10,960 --> 03:55:11,980
We'll never know.

7784
03:55:12,440 --> 03:55:14,280
We'll never know what's over there.

7785
03:55:15,780 --> 03:55:16,980
We'll never know.

7786
03:55:16,980 --> 03:55:17,180
We'll never know.

7787
03:55:17,620 --> 03:55:23,960
Okay, so if we stack on top of each other, like at least three or four high, we can at least just jump off together, I think.

7788
03:55:24,080 --> 03:55:25,300
So we won't lose anybody.

7789
03:55:25,300 --> 03:55:26,340
She just never moves.

7790
03:55:26,340 --> 03:55:27,460
She never...

7791
03:55:27,460 --> 03:55:28,780
She disassociated.

7792
03:55:30,000 --> 03:55:31,120
I am.

7793
03:55:31,120 --> 03:55:32,160
At this point, I am.

7794
03:55:32,480 --> 03:55:34,620
She just goes and she decided.

7795
03:55:35,100 --> 03:55:35,820
Alright,

7796
03:55:38,880 --> 03:55:39,640
everybody run off.

7797
03:55:39,940 --> 03:55:42,720
Alright, let's see what's over there.

7798
03:55:43,100 --> 03:55:43,820
Exploring.

7799
03:55:43,820 --> 03:55:44,120
Oh, see?

7800
03:55:44,240 --> 03:55:45,340
Oh, we...

7801
03:55:45,340 --> 03:55:46,000
No!

7802
03:55:46,980 --> 03:55:48,760
What is this?

7803
03:55:49,280 --> 03:55:50,000
Guys.

7804
03:55:50,820 --> 03:55:52,540
How do we make it plus?

7805
03:55:52,540 --> 03:55:53,680
What the...

7806
03:55:53,680 --> 03:55:54,580
Oh, we're so fast!

7807
03:55:54,900 --> 03:55:55,820
Super speed!

7808
03:55:56,380 --> 03:56:00,000
Guys, one by one.

7809
03:56:00,120 --> 03:56:01,520
Personal responsibility.

7810
03:56:04,240 --> 03:56:06,020
At least here you don't...

7811
03:56:06,500 --> 03:56:08,520
Don't forget there's like spikes and stuff.

7812
03:56:08,620 --> 03:56:09,020
Yeah.

7813
03:56:09,980 --> 03:56:10,540
Okay.

7814
03:56:10,980 --> 03:56:11,540
Easy.

7815
03:56:12,280 --> 03:56:14,860
This is where we have to pay attention.

7816
03:56:14,860 --> 03:56:15,760
We had the practice.

7817
03:56:16,640 --> 03:56:18,300
Now it's the real deal.

7818
03:56:18,680 --> 03:56:20,240
Okay, Amelie, get closer.

7819
03:56:20,400 --> 03:56:20,760
Amelie?

7820
03:56:21,100 --> 03:56:22,440
Yeah, I'm a little scared guys.

7821
03:56:22,540 --> 03:56:23,720
No, no, don't worry.

7822
03:56:23,720 --> 03:56:25,220
You can hit us like a brick now.

7823
03:56:25,340 --> 03:56:27,180
Just smack into us.

7824
03:56:28,160 --> 03:56:28,880
Yeah, there you go.

7825
03:56:29,620 --> 03:56:30,020
Okay.

7826
03:56:31,580 --> 03:56:32,680
We're making a wall.

7827
03:56:33,780 --> 03:56:35,040
Oh my god.

7828
03:56:35,560 --> 03:56:37,900
Jump over, jump over now because you smacked into it.

7829
03:56:38,120 --> 03:56:38,440
There we go.

7830
03:56:39,780 --> 03:56:40,880
Jump over now.

7831
03:56:43,700 --> 03:56:44,460
I'm gonna jump over.

7832
03:56:44,600 --> 03:56:45,080
I'm gonna do it.

7833
03:56:46,740 --> 03:56:47,140
Okay.

7834
03:56:47,280 --> 03:56:48,100
Careful, careful.

7835
03:56:48,840 --> 03:56:50,740
We all know where the spikes are.

7836
03:56:51,440 --> 03:56:51,840
Oh!

7837
03:56:52,540 --> 03:56:52,880
Look at the speed.

7838
03:56:53,100 --> 03:56:54,460
I was trying to adjust.

7839
03:56:56,040 --> 03:56:57,520
It went through ramp.

7840
03:56:57,660 --> 03:56:59,280
I was like, careful guys, don't jump off.

7841
03:57:01,680 --> 03:57:02,300
It's okay.

7842
03:57:03,300 --> 03:57:04,680
At least we figured it out.

7843
03:57:05,320 --> 03:57:08,500
It's so fiddly and rubber bandy once you have the speed.

7844
03:57:08,560 --> 03:57:10,540
Like the game does not know how to like accommodate it.

7845
03:57:11,660 --> 03:57:12,220
What the?

7846
03:57:12,680 --> 03:57:13,720
Why did you do that?

7847
03:57:13,720 --> 03:57:15,840
How did you guys die like that?

7848
03:57:16,600 --> 03:57:17,380
Why did you do that?

7849
03:57:19,260 --> 03:57:20,140
What happened?

7850
03:57:20,880 --> 03:57:21,320
Wait.

7851
03:57:22,540 --> 03:57:22,720
What happened?

7852
03:57:23,220 --> 03:57:25,400
My hand was not even on the keyboard.

7853
03:57:26,260 --> 03:57:26,700
I know.

7854
03:57:27,460 --> 03:57:29,580
I think you need to pay more attention, man.

7855
03:57:30,340 --> 03:57:31,740
I wasn't even on the keyboard.

7856
03:57:31,780 --> 03:57:33,100
I wasn't even scratching out.

7857
03:57:36,060 --> 03:57:37,140
She's scratching out.

7858
03:57:38,300 --> 03:57:39,480
I saw people move.

7859
03:57:39,560 --> 03:57:40,380
I thought we were doing it.

7860
03:57:40,480 --> 03:57:41,180
I can't even.

7861
03:57:43,180 --> 03:57:45,960
I made a big mistake.

7862
03:57:50,380 --> 03:57:51,420
She just left.

7863
03:57:51,700 --> 03:57:53,180
She's like, bye guys.

7864
03:57:53,500 --> 03:57:55,780
I panicked.

7865
03:57:58,160 --> 03:57:59,180
Okay, here we go.

7866
03:58:00,760 --> 03:58:01,540
Try again.

7867
03:58:01,680 --> 03:58:02,880
Don't do it, don't do it.

7868
03:58:02,980 --> 03:58:05,460
I'm going to wait for it to become a full stop.

7869
03:58:05,920 --> 03:58:06,400
Stop.

7870
03:58:06,600 --> 03:58:07,080
Okay.

7871
03:58:08,100 --> 03:58:09,200
Yeah, there we go.

7872
03:58:09,280 --> 03:58:10,480
Now we keep going.

7873
03:58:11,200 --> 03:58:13,580
Be careful, it's gonna all...

7874
03:58:13,580 --> 03:58:14,320
Why can't I?

7875
03:58:14,560 --> 03:58:15,400
Oh, sorry.

7876
03:58:16,600 --> 03:58:17,740
Go over here.

7877
03:58:18,140 --> 03:58:19,320
I'll just be here.

7878
03:58:19,580 --> 03:58:20,440
Doki gets a head start.

7879
03:58:21,820 --> 03:58:23,480
But we don't die here anyway.

7880
03:58:23,600 --> 03:58:24,100
It's fine, whatever.

7881
03:58:24,860 --> 03:58:25,700
Oh, my bad.

7882
03:58:25,740 --> 03:58:26,180
Sorry.

7883
03:58:26,940 --> 03:58:27,560
Sorry, Val.

7884
03:58:28,440 --> 03:58:30,480
Okay, there's...

7885
03:58:30,480 --> 03:58:32,320
These are the death.

7886
03:58:33,400 --> 03:58:34,160
The death.

7887
03:58:35,640 --> 03:58:36,380
The death.

7888
03:58:36,700 --> 03:58:38,540
Okay, use this as a way to stop.

7889
03:58:38,860 --> 03:58:39,860
Oh, I fucked up.

7890
03:58:42,020 --> 03:58:43,380
Just launch yourself.

7891
03:58:43,500 --> 03:58:44,160
You hit us.

7892
03:58:45,960 --> 03:58:47,100
The doors are open for you.

7893
03:58:47,220 --> 03:58:48,320
Come in for a hug.

7894
03:58:48,400 --> 03:58:49,220
Glomp us.

7895
03:58:49,720 --> 03:58:50,400
Glomp us.

7896
03:58:50,740 --> 03:58:52,160
Free glomps.

7897
03:58:52,460 --> 03:58:53,980
XD glomps you.

7898
03:58:56,160 --> 03:58:56,700
Okay.

7899
03:59:01,380 --> 03:59:01,920
Corky.

7900
03:59:02,800 --> 03:59:03,340
Corky.

7901
03:59:04,040 --> 03:59:04,580
Corky.

7902
03:59:04,580 --> 03:59:05,140
I'm stacking.

7903
03:59:06,140 --> 03:59:07,640
So I don't have to do anything.

7904
03:59:08,080 --> 03:59:10,240
Wait for it to come to the full stop.

7905
03:59:10,240 --> 03:59:10,760
Beep.

7906
03:59:10,800 --> 03:59:10,940
Beep.

7907
03:59:10,940 --> 03:59:11,300
Beep.

7908
03:59:11,500 --> 03:59:11,980
Beep.

7909
03:59:13,800 --> 03:59:14,280
And...

7910
03:59:14,280 --> 03:59:14,720
Go.

7911
03:59:16,520 --> 03:59:19,840
Oh, I can't move.

7912
03:59:20,120 --> 03:59:20,760
I can't move.

7913
03:59:21,860 --> 03:59:23,860
Oh, there it is.

7914
03:59:25,340 --> 03:59:26,340
There it is.

7915
03:59:27,600 --> 03:59:28,260
It's all good.

7916
03:59:29,820 --> 03:59:30,620
I'm gonna go.

7917
03:59:31,640 --> 03:59:32,120
I'm gonna go.

7918
03:59:32,120 --> 03:59:32,460
There it is.

7919
03:59:32,960 --> 03:59:35,200
Oh, my god.

7920
03:59:35,320 --> 03:59:37,880
Oh, my god.

7921
03:59:37,880 --> 03:59:38,300
Oh, my god.

7922
03:59:38,340 --> 03:59:38,660
Hold on.

7923
03:59:38,680 --> 03:59:39,020
Hold on.

7924
03:59:40,240 --> 03:59:41,120
I'm trying to correct.

7925
03:59:41,220 --> 03:59:41,840
I'm trying to correct.

7926
03:59:42,180 --> 03:59:43,020
Oh, my god.

7927
03:59:43,240 --> 03:59:43,640
Be careful.

7928
03:59:43,820 --> 03:59:44,280
This is...

7929
03:59:44,280 --> 03:59:46,140
What is going on?

7930
03:59:49,160 --> 03:59:54,640
I think Min's like ghostiness just like carried us cause she literally just floated on the floor.

7931
03:59:55,500 --> 03:59:57,180
Floated like three times.

7932
03:59:59,280 --> 04:00:00,720
What can I say?

7933
04:00:01,440 --> 04:00:02,800
I'm hacking the game.

7934
04:00:04,420 --> 04:00:05,820
Devs is watching.

7935
04:00:06,860 --> 04:00:07,420
Good.

7936
04:00:07,420 --> 04:00:08,480
I hope they are.

7937
04:00:09,180 --> 04:00:11,480
I hope they are and take the game off Steam.

7938
04:00:11,760 --> 04:00:12,040
Yeah.

7939
04:00:18,320 --> 04:00:18,880
Now we're fast.

7940
04:00:18,880 --> 04:00:25,000
I don't know about you guys but as soon as we go fast like the camera starts like rubber banding back and forth.

7941
04:00:25,180 --> 04:00:25,720
It's awful.

7942
04:00:25,920 --> 04:00:27,300
Oh, my god.

7943
04:00:29,300 --> 04:00:29,740
No.

7944
04:00:29,740 --> 04:00:29,860
No.

7945
04:00:36,220 --> 04:00:38,740
This level is fucking horrible.

7946
04:00:39,480 --> 04:00:44,240
We go again and again and again and again and again and then we'll master it.

7947
04:00:44,600 --> 04:00:45,340
Again.

7948
04:00:46,300 --> 04:00:47,140
No.

7949
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:48,840
Again.

7950
04:00:50,500 --> 04:00:52,460
I love it.

7951
04:00:52,540 --> 04:00:52,960
Again.

7952
04:00:53,500 --> 04:00:55,220
Try again.

7953
04:00:56,280 --> 04:00:57,240
Full stop.

7954
04:00:57,340 --> 04:00:58,160
Couple more levels.

7955
04:00:58,440 --> 04:00:59,760
Alright, we're at our station.

7956
04:01:00,760 --> 04:01:01,320
Again.

7957
04:01:02,980 --> 04:01:03,260
Again.

7958
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:04,160
Yay.

7959
04:01:06,360 --> 04:01:07,700
Off we go.

7960
04:01:12,000 --> 04:01:14,540
Button that turns you into a bug.

7961
04:01:14,980 --> 04:01:15,980
Here we go.

7962
04:01:16,500 --> 04:01:17,060
Alright.

7963
04:01:17,560 --> 04:01:19,460
Use it as a wall.

7964
04:01:19,680 --> 04:01:20,260
Use the wall.

7965
04:01:20,380 --> 04:01:21,880
Build a wall for the other people.

7966
04:01:22,840 --> 04:01:23,880
Build the wall.

7967
04:01:24,040 --> 04:01:26,200
We have our net coming in.

7968
04:01:27,460 --> 04:01:28,320
It's like a safety net.

7969
04:01:30,140 --> 04:01:31,600
Just jump from that.

7970
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:32,500
Use that as a jump.

7971
04:01:33,100 --> 04:01:33,880
Use that.

7972
04:01:35,180 --> 04:01:35,860
Come on.

7973
04:01:36,940 --> 04:01:37,440
Okay.

7974
04:01:38,420 --> 04:01:40,080
I'm looking away from the spikes.

7975
04:01:40,280 --> 04:01:41,460
None of us will hit the spikes now.

7976
04:01:42,140 --> 04:01:43,160
What do you mean?

7977
04:01:43,460 --> 04:01:44,600
Like that.

7978
04:01:45,120 --> 04:01:46,120
It's like a barrier.

7979
04:01:46,520 --> 04:01:48,240
I don't think that's how that works.

7980
04:01:48,240 --> 04:01:50,060
It will change the camera though.

7981
04:01:51,140 --> 04:01:52,360
It's kind of working actually.

7982
04:01:52,740 --> 04:01:55,080
I am the wall.

7983
04:01:57,460 --> 04:01:57,580
How about you?

7984
04:01:58,280 --> 04:01:59,740
We need more room.

7985
04:02:00,020 --> 04:02:02,040
Are you going to make this?

7986
04:02:02,100 --> 04:02:02,580
I don't know.

7987
04:02:03,560 --> 04:02:04,820
This is going to be interesting.

7988
04:02:06,380 --> 04:02:07,640
You can make it.

7989
04:02:08,120 --> 04:02:08,760
Don't choke.

7990
04:02:09,780 --> 04:02:10,500
There you go.

7991
04:02:12,780 --> 04:02:13,820
Look at that.

7992
04:02:14,400 --> 04:02:15,760
And then we have to jump back here.

7993
04:02:16,200 --> 04:02:17,600
We don't have to jump on the panel.

7994
04:02:19,160 --> 04:02:20,380
Just jump over it.

7995
04:02:21,400 --> 04:02:23,180
Don't hit the button at the end.

7996
04:02:23,580 --> 04:02:24,480
Do I have to go?

7997
04:02:24,860 --> 04:02:25,300
Yes.

7998
04:02:27,460 --> 04:02:28,220
Jump over the spikes.

7999
04:02:29,440 --> 04:02:30,440
It's your turn.

8000
04:02:31,060 --> 04:02:32,080
No pressure.

8001
04:02:33,300 --> 04:02:37,140
Now the sand is going to make you go extremely fast.

8002
04:02:37,560 --> 04:02:38,360
Extremely fast.

8003
04:02:39,320 --> 04:02:41,180
Go only right.

8004
04:02:41,320 --> 04:02:42,060
Do not go left.

8005
04:02:42,560 --> 04:02:43,800
Oh my god.

8006
04:02:45,280 --> 04:02:46,060
Oh my god.

8007
04:02:46,620 --> 04:02:48,740
I need you guys to move the camera guys.

8008
04:02:48,880 --> 04:02:49,220
I'm sorry.

8009
04:02:50,880 --> 04:02:51,580
Oh no.

8010
04:02:51,660 --> 04:02:52,260
Oh no.

8011
04:02:55,060 --> 04:02:56,580
Somebody has to grab the key.

8012
04:02:57,520 --> 04:02:58,220
There you go.

8013
04:02:58,300 --> 04:02:59,000
I got it.

8014
04:02:59,400 --> 04:02:59,760
Move left.

8015
04:03:01,180 --> 04:03:02,460
This is the barrier.

8016
04:03:04,200 --> 04:03:04,660
Doki.

8017
04:03:05,040 --> 04:03:05,980
I got you.

8018
04:03:11,460 --> 04:03:12,800
Oh my god.

8019
04:03:18,590 --> 04:03:20,110
I was going to throw up.

8020
04:03:20,270 --> 04:03:20,690
I swear to god.

8021
04:03:20,810 --> 04:03:21,970
I'm holding it in.

8022
04:03:22,710 --> 04:03:23,690
I'm having a hard time.

8023
04:03:24,110 --> 04:03:26,030
Oh my god.

8024
04:03:26,030 --> 04:03:26,810
What the fuck.

8025
04:03:32,590 --> 04:03:33,130
Oh my god.

8026
04:03:33,190 --> 04:03:35,290
I literally went to take a freaking swig of water.

8027
04:03:35,390 --> 04:03:36,070
I dropped it.

8028
04:03:36,090 --> 04:03:38,250
And then it just started pouring into the vent on my floor.

8029
04:03:38,330 --> 04:03:38,970
I hope that's fine.

8030
04:03:39,110 --> 04:03:39,950
I hope that's okay.

8031
04:03:41,230 --> 04:03:42,670
There's no water breaks there.

8032
04:03:43,890 --> 04:03:44,370
Wait.

8033
04:03:45,930 --> 04:03:47,110
I've got water everywhere.

8034
04:03:47,350 --> 04:03:48,630
It's pouring into the vent.

8035
04:03:48,910 --> 04:03:49,670
Is that bad?

8036
04:03:54,690 --> 04:03:56,750
Free humidifier.

8037
04:03:57,210 --> 04:03:57,690
Yeah.

8038
04:03:57,810 --> 04:03:59,190
Now you have a humidifier.

8039
04:04:01,430 --> 04:04:02,210
Oh my god.

8040
04:04:02,250 --> 04:04:02,410
Oh my god.

8041
04:04:02,410 --> 04:04:02,890
Please guys.

8042
04:04:04,110 --> 04:04:04,990
I can't.

8043
04:04:04,990 --> 04:04:06,410
I'm all the way at the back.

8044
04:04:06,490 --> 04:04:07,370
I can't do anything.

8045
04:04:11,190 --> 04:04:12,690
Someone needs to go up.

8046
04:04:12,790 --> 04:04:14,230
Someone needs to move up first.

8047
04:04:15,310 --> 04:04:16,430
It pushes us.

8048
04:04:16,490 --> 04:04:17,390
We just move automatically.

8049
04:04:17,650 --> 04:04:18,730
You just need to jump.

8050
04:04:19,130 --> 04:04:19,570
Yeah.

8051
04:04:19,890 --> 04:04:20,530
Skill issue.

8052
04:04:22,570 --> 04:04:24,030
What does the button do?

8053
04:04:24,030 --> 04:04:25,410
You just have to be really quick to jump.

8054
04:04:25,490 --> 04:04:27,190
How come the button says a plus?

8055
04:04:27,410 --> 04:04:29,050
It makes us faster.

8056
04:04:29,370 --> 04:04:30,390
It's the same thing as before.

8057
04:04:30,850 --> 04:04:33,410
It's not as fast though because I don't feel it.

8058
04:04:33,770 --> 04:04:35,490
I'm not really feeling the sensation.

8059
04:04:35,910 --> 04:04:37,530
The high isn't hitting me.

8060
04:04:37,550 --> 04:04:38,650
You can't jump on top of me.

8061
04:04:38,650 --> 04:04:39,070
I'm sorry.

8062
04:04:39,230 --> 04:04:40,810
I jumped up once to test it.

8063
04:04:44,590 --> 04:04:46,870
Why are you on top of us?

8064
04:04:47,070 --> 04:04:48,470
Why do you think I can slow it down?

8065
04:04:48,610 --> 04:04:49,270
I was testing.

8066
04:04:49,270 --> 04:04:49,890
I was testing.

8067
04:04:51,230 --> 04:04:52,770
You've already tested it.

8068
04:04:57,450 --> 04:04:59,830
It has to be like a frame perfect jump.

8069
04:05:07,210 --> 04:05:09,290
Why is this so difficult?

8070
04:05:09,290 --> 04:05:10,830
I think I actually have to go.

8071
04:05:10,910 --> 04:05:13,170
I said I was going to stay here for three hours.

8072
04:05:13,190 --> 04:05:13,910
What the fuck?

8073
04:05:16,030 --> 04:05:16,990
It's our turn.

8074
04:05:17,830 --> 04:05:19,130
We were so close.

8075
04:05:19,990 --> 04:05:21,430
Part 3.

8076
04:05:21,690 --> 04:05:23,230
Are we going to do a part 3?

8077
04:05:23,550 --> 04:05:24,550
Part 3.

8078
04:05:26,150 --> 04:05:27,370
Part 3.

8079
04:05:27,370 --> 04:05:28,590
We're so close to victory.

8080
04:05:29,110 --> 04:05:29,970
Let's go.

8081
04:05:30,970 --> 04:05:32,050
Part 3.

8082
04:05:33,050 --> 04:05:34,410
We have to synchronize.

8083
04:05:34,530 --> 04:05:34,990
Thank you guys.

8084
04:05:35,950 --> 04:05:37,230
We're safe.

8085
04:05:37,290 --> 04:05:38,170
We're free now.

8086
04:05:38,810 --> 04:05:39,570
Freedom.

8087
04:05:40,270 --> 04:05:41,810
Part 3.

8088
04:05:42,250 --> 04:05:43,410
The finale.

8089
04:05:45,490 --> 04:05:46,250
GG's.

8090
04:05:47,050 --> 04:05:47,810
GG's.

8091
04:05:49,490 --> 04:05:50,090
GG's.

8092
04:05:50,170 --> 04:05:51,210
We have...

8093
04:05:52,390 --> 04:05:54,450
We have part 3.

8094
04:05:54,830 --> 04:05:55,610
That was exhausting.

8095
04:05:55,690 --> 04:05:57,730
Go through the seizure part by herself.

8096
04:05:58,870 --> 04:06:02,650
I'll complete that part so we can lock the shadow area.

8097
04:06:03,170 --> 04:06:04,270
That's the true endurance.

8098
04:06:04,750 --> 04:06:05,910
That's the true endurance.

8099
04:06:06,170 --> 04:06:07,450
The true endurance.

8100
04:06:08,530 --> 04:06:10,750
Is that completely a dark or something?

8101
04:06:10,750 --> 04:06:12,410
We would just drag you down, you know?

8102
04:06:12,650 --> 04:06:13,910
This should all be you.

8103
04:06:15,470 --> 04:06:16,290
GG's, guys.

8104
04:06:16,290 --> 04:06:20,330
I'm so happy to play four hours of Pico Parque.

8105
04:06:20,690 --> 04:06:20,810
You did so good.

8106
04:06:21,910 --> 04:06:24,810
There's no group I would rather suffer with.

8107
04:06:25,310 --> 04:06:25,990
I'm so excited.

8108
04:06:26,170 --> 04:06:28,410
I love a test of teamwork.

8109
04:06:28,710 --> 04:06:29,510
It's so satisfying.

8110
04:06:30,130 --> 04:06:30,450
Yay.

8111
04:06:33,110 --> 04:06:34,570
Bye, everybody.

8112
04:06:34,630 --> 04:06:35,330
Bye, guys.

8113
04:06:37,170 --> 04:06:37,850
GG's.

8114
04:06:37,850 --> 04:06:38,630
Bye, guys.

8115
04:06:40,010 --> 04:06:40,350
Bye.

8116
04:06:40,350 --> 04:06:41,030
Bye.

8117
04:06:44,890 --> 04:06:45,750
Oh my god.

8118
04:06:46,030 --> 04:06:47,810
I'm so tired.

8119
04:06:48,790 --> 04:06:49,550
I'm so...

8120
04:06:50,870 --> 04:06:51,650
I'm so...

8121
04:06:52,790 --> 04:06:53,850
I'm so tired.

8122
04:06:55,310 --> 04:06:56,770
By the way, guys.

8123
04:06:56,850 --> 04:06:58,130
I didn't say anything earlier.

8124
04:06:58,850 --> 04:07:00,350
But I'm sick right now.

8125
04:07:00,670 --> 04:07:01,970
I'm sick.

8126
04:07:06,890 --> 04:07:08,530
But I powered through.

8127
04:07:13,470 --> 04:07:14,990
I have a sore throat.

8128
04:07:15,090 --> 04:07:17,910
Like, my throat is, like, really fucked up at the moment.

8129
04:07:18,050 --> 04:07:18,930
It's, like, sore.

8130
04:07:19,150 --> 04:07:21,610
So, like, you know how, like, when you know you're starting to get sick.

8131
04:07:21,830 --> 04:07:24,630
And then, like, your throat starts feeling super sore.

8132
04:07:25,630 --> 04:07:26,650
And a little pain.

8133
04:07:26,710 --> 04:07:27,290
That's me.

8134
04:07:29,470 --> 04:07:31,150
But that was really fun.

8135
04:07:31,250 --> 04:07:33,770
We actually made a lot of progress.

8136
04:07:34,190 --> 04:07:36,030
We made a lot of progress.

8137
04:07:36,310 --> 04:07:38,110
Even though, like, um...

8138
04:07:38,110 --> 04:07:39,770
Even though, you know, it was...

8139
04:07:41,670 --> 04:07:42,570
We still made progress.

8140
04:07:42,590 --> 04:07:44,310
We still made a lot of progress.

8141
04:07:44,410 --> 04:07:45,030
I'm proud of it.

8142
04:07:45,310 --> 04:07:48,110
We literally have, like, two more...

8143
04:07:48,110 --> 04:07:50,110
Two more... three more stages left.

8144
04:07:50,290 --> 04:07:51,310
And then we'll be finished.

8145
04:07:51,830 --> 04:07:53,670
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

8146
04:07:54,490 --> 04:07:55,710
I'm gonna go sleep now.

8147
04:07:56,490 --> 04:07:58,770
I'm gonna get some fucking meds.

8148
04:07:59,670 --> 04:08:01,070
And then take my meds.

8149
04:08:01,130 --> 04:08:01,910
And then...

8150
04:08:01,910 --> 04:08:09,830
And then go sleep.

8151
04:08:12,790 --> 04:08:14,450
I'm not, like, sick-sick yet.

8152
04:08:14,510 --> 04:08:16,430
But, like, I'm starting to get sick.

8153
04:08:16,610 --> 04:08:19,490
Like, you know, like, when you can feel your throat getting sore.

8154
04:08:19,670 --> 04:08:21,310
And you're like, Oh, that's the sign.

8155
04:08:21,630 --> 04:08:24,490
That's the sign where it's gonna hit soon.

8156
04:08:25,510 --> 04:08:26,310
Um, but...

8157
04:08:26,310 --> 04:08:27,830
Yeah, I'm gonna call it here.

8158
04:08:27,990 --> 04:08:29,170
I'm gonna fucking go sleep.

8159
04:08:29,650 --> 04:08:32,250
So I can get better as fast as I can.

8160
04:08:32,470 --> 04:08:34,750
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

8161
04:08:35,030 --> 04:08:35,610
Posture check.

8162
04:08:35,630 --> 04:08:36,450
Get up and move around.

8163
04:08:36,550 --> 04:08:37,510
To get that blood flowing.

8164
04:08:37,670 --> 04:08:39,930
And if you suffer me, head to bed.

8165
04:08:39,930 --> 04:08:41,350
Cause you deserve it.

8166
04:08:41,370 --> 04:08:42,890
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

8167
04:08:43,510 --> 04:08:44,570
Bye, guys.

8168
04:08:45,270 --> 04:08:45,830
Bye.
