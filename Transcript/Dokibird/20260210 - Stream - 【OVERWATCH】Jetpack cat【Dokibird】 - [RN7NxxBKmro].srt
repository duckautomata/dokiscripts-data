2026 is my retro era.

29
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,190
It's nostalgic era.

30
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,150
It was a good time.

31
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,830
And then bring back Retrodokie.

32
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,450
We're going backwards today.

33
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,810
So for those who don't know.

34
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,650
For those who don't know.

35
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:11,310
uh uh Overwatch 2 is no longer Overwatch 2 it's Overwatch
they decide I can't believe it Overwatch is back before GTA

36
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:25,070
6 came out um and uh we're evolving backwards yeah so it's
officially called Overwatch um and we're restarting the

37
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:37,110
season so technically it's season one of overwatch now um in
an hour it's season one of overwatch um and not only that

38
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:46,290
but they are dropping five new characters to support oh yeah
by the way mizuki i think it's mizuki that's his name right

39
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:55,190
the the mizuki is all is basically invisible woman's old so
like it's it's not you don't disappear in it but it has the

40
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:02,950
um it's like a little shield it's like a circular shield and
like uh it amplifies when you shoot out so it's similar to i

41
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:11,290
mean in this and it heals it heals and amplify and amplifies
your damage type deal um um but the one that we're looking

42
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:19,770
forward to the most is the cat with the jet pack named jet
pack cat i don't even know if he has a real fucking name um

43
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:30,710
but but his name is jet pack cat and that's the one i'm
apparently to if like someone pisses you off you could like

44
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:43,730
pick jetpack cat and just throw somebody off the cliff uh uh
who fika fika is his actual yeah who like he even pays

45
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:54,130
attention to that it's jetpack cat uh yes you could actually
take them hostage i think the coolest clip i saw was like

46
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:02,310
people were doing cage matches uh with like someone will
carry a maga and then the other will carry like the whoever

47
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:10,770
his challenger is and then a maga will they would be flying
up in the air and the maga ults in the cage match and then

48
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,010
like it's like a it's like a flying cage match is actually
pretty insane and i saw another clip where they so the

49
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:27,350
jetpack cat took a cassidy and then the cassidy was like
it's how new and like hop in the sky it's like how you dodge

50
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:35,890
that how the fuck do you dodge a flying dead eye like how do
you dodge the hollown and like you try like don't worry i'm

51
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:47,770
gonna go behind this shield and then he fucking just is in
the air he's just in the sky you don't like aerial attack

52
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:55,550
incoming michael they get the aca super they get thank you i
think that's everybody is uh looking forward to at the

53
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:04,410
moment um um with uh with i think i think jetpack cat is
actually the character that everyone is um obsessing over at

54
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:19,610
the moment oh yeah for before i say more i need to remember
the show uh anniversary merch is out now yeah and oh yeah

55
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:27,950
bash oh yeah bastion with jetpack cat is actually like a
drone attack like an artillery strike too remember if like

56
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,350
bastion alts the bastion alts and then you get the jetpack
cat like it doesn't do anything but it looks like a fucking

57
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:44,860
artillery strike from the sky it looks like a fucking drone
attack or an attack chopper yeah the ac 130 and then when he

58
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,180
it's literally a drone attack uh air superiority yeah

Overwatch minds.

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,400
Anyway.

107
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:18,920
All right.

108
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,820
We finished Sunday, Monday, and we're at Tuesday.

109
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,520
Wednesday is the, I mean, they haven't announced it.

110
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,120
I feel like it's fine.

111
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,700
Like they're going to announce it in like, I'm pretty sure a
couple of hours.

112
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,600
But we all know what the new season is the new early axis.

113
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,980
So we will be sponsored to check out the Marvel Rivals Early
Access for Elsa.

114
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,840
I don't know what team I'm in yet.

115
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,060
I don't know what team.

116
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,200
And yet, so like, because it's not listed out.

117
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,760
Other than, I mean, it's sort of, it's tradition at this
point.

118
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,080
And today is, obviously, I wanted to try out on launch day.

119
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,260
Because it's the best time, like for Overwatch.

120
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,180
Because I felt like, you know, we all get to experience it

replacing coney for the pubg tournament i asked heavenly if

127
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:04,040
russian badger was down well i asked gomez to ask heavenly
uh because he was playing with heavenly if like practicing

128
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,380
with heavenly if russian badger was free to do it and he is
free so i've never interacted with russian badger before but

129
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,480
i know like he has had siege experience so and like he's
close friends with heavenly so i was like okay i'm shooting

130
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,600
my shot and uh and i saw a lot of people asking me to ask
russian badger when i post up the initial tweet of

131
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,460
recruiting someone so um i don't really personally know who
he is i know a lot of people a lot of you guys were

132
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:41,920
requesting russian badger and heavenly um heavenly responded
say he wanted to try join and then and i saw a lot of people

133
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:50,700
being like at russian badger at russian badger so um i asked
heavenly if he could ask okay i asked gomez to ask heavenly

134
00:14:50,700 --> 00:15:01,660
if to ask russian badger made it a little bit complicated
there if he was free and they uh he said he is so he's gonna

135
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:12,220
be joining our team uh on on Sunday I've never interacted
with him before but uh I I you guys said that he seems

136
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:20,220
really he's a really funny guy so and he brings the vibes so
and he's really good at siege and FPS games so I trust you

137
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:32,960
guys and he seems like a really funny guy uh yeah uh I know
a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy

138
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,280
So he's going to be on our team.

139
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,200
What else?

140
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,580
He accidentally double booked.

141
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,300
He promised another obligation on that day on Sunday.

142
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,000
So he had to choose one or the other.

143
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,920
And he said the other one was like a full day.

144
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,120
So he had to do the other one instead.

145
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,520
And I think he promised that one first.

146
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,000
And then didn't realize what week mine was exactly.

147
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
I didn't tell him the date.

148
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,500
I think he just got he was like just really busy and
everything um so he didn't realize that he accidentally

149
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:19,860
double booked uh for that day uh so that's really what
happened and that's really what happened um I saw Lily's

150
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:33,680
team was actually practicing for the game my team hasn't and

characters two take that's our two supports two dps and one

218
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:07,340

because they were all focused on like onron and who even is

219
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:16,300
i already forgot who the other dps is no one has like gave a
fuck about Overwatch, new characters.

220
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,160
Like, who?

221
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,880
Everyone, oh, yeah, the guy.

222
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,560
The one, oh, wait, the, okay, I was going to say the one
guy, but I forgot Mizuki is also a guy.

223
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,000
But, like, it's, yeah, it's Soldier 78.

224
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,880
The other guy, no one, I felt like he's just, yeah, the evil
soldier said, I'm you, but evil.

225
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
He's literally...

226
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,080
He's literally like anti, what was his name?

227
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,900
Anti-Fla- Anti-Solji.

228
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,900
What was the guy?

229
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,720
Reverse Flash.

230
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Reverse Solji.

231
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,460
It was me.

232
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,280
It was me, Barry.

233
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,920
What was Solji 76's name?

234
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,360
It was me, Jack.

235
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,060
It was me, Jack.

236
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,280
That's right.

237
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,660
It's me, Jack.

238
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,660
Okay, you know what's...

239
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,640
I still can't believe they killed Doomfist on February.

240
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,160
I think that's...

241
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,580
I was just like, whoa.

242
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,380
I'm just like, that's like...

243
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,540
That's a very unfortunate timing.

244
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,860
Yeah, it's wild, yeah.

245
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,540
He just fell out of the window.

246
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,320
He shouldn't be fine.

247
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:02,580
Apparently, he's like, he's apparently dead and killed by
Vendetta.

248
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,220
He's going to come back.

249
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,880
They're not going to be like, we're just going to delete
Doomfist off the roster.

250
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,000
Like, I mean, a lot of people will be very happy.

251
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:22,900
including support players and like finally he's dead no
longer no longer i will have to go against doom fist and

252
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:29,160
also that is true there's no fall damage in overwatch so how
could he die

253
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:42,520
and then like okay so the current lore is that vendetta took
over talon talon or whatever and like um and he killed she

254
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,780
killed the doom fist was the leader of talon and then she
killed doom fist like she pushed him out of the window which

255
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:56,680
is crazy because like people were like how the fuck like
she's like how the fuck did like doom fist die to her when

256
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:10,720
he literally like one v'd for a tracer winston um and genji
and hanzo like everyone's like wait that how the fuck he was

257
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:19,720
gonna blink and then Vintana comes in and pushes him out of
the window what is this like what is this the Russian

258
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:27,280
assassins who somehow for some reason every time they try to
someone mysteriously dies in Russia they get pushed out the

259
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:36,860
window like don't you don't use no too much don't get near
windows don't you're not supposed to say that out loud but

260
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:44,280
anyway uh Allegedly, allegedly, allegedly.

261
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,440
They're all natural caught deaths, by the way.

262
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:52,620
They just have, there's just a lot of clumsy people in
Russia that just happen to stand behind windows.

263
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,240
Allegedly.

264
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,100
Anyway, so the sole store is that she, anyway, she pushes
him out the window.

265
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,480
He's, quote unquote, dead.

266
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:18,880
Ombra and Widowmaker leaves Talon, um, and be like, peace, I
guess, like, oh, no, Talon lost your biggest money maker

267
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,080
because Blizzard gave them all the skin.

268
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,080
I don't know.

269
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,300
How will Talon be funded now?

270
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,920
Reaper and Widow were literally the money makers of Talon.

271
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,120
Oh, no.

272
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,180
That's your essay.

273
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,280
Thank you, Miss Super Chat.

274
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:36,600
Thank you.

275
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,260
Thank you.

276
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,120
I saw JDK fans slandering, Doomfist, and Sower.

277
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,020
take him out the roster and rework him thank you for the
super chat thank you thank you i mean they did take fuse out

278
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:53,980
of the roster i still don't know why they took out fuse guys
he was there for 30 minutes i was about to play him and then

279
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:04,380
he's just gone yeah i know yeah apparently the reason why
reaper left was because um he killed her dad he killed

280
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,640
vendetta's dad so he was just like oh

281
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:18,420
and Widow left though I guess Widow is just like I guess
Widow is just like we ride or die bro we Widow and Samba we

282
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:24,460
ride or die I guess Samba was like I help my fellow Latino

283
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:36,600
Yeah he thought it was gonna be awkward you know like
obviously she was gonna kill him if he stayed like I feel

284
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:46,340
like yeah if he stayed it's gonna be so fucking awkward like
like Oh yeah, well Sigma is not forgotten.

285
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,520
He's literally crazy.

286
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,760
Like he doesn't even fucking know what the fuck is going on.

287
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,060
It's not like he's forgotten.

288
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:01,140
He's literally like so, so insane that he doesn't even know
what the fuck is going on.

289
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,380
Like if you tell him there, God, he's not gonna register and
he's literally crazy.

290
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,960
Like the numbers got him.

291
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,580
He's just like, the numbers!

292
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,080
What do they mean?

293
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
Like, the numbers!

294
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,420
It literally got him.

295
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,500
Who's, who's Doomfist?

296
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,340
Yeah, he's gonna be like, who the fuck is Doomfist?

297
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,630
Alright, I'm almost done with my...

298
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,990
I'm not streaming on Friday, guys.

299
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,850
Too many streams.

300
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:41,470
I might do double streams on Thursday, because, like, I
don't like that as two Twitch streams, so I might do an

301
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,310
extra bonus...

I do not want to be stuck on God of War for like half a year

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,920
Oh my god, don't even have a straw?

350
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,100
What the fuck?

351
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,940

352
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,420
Alright, it's fine.

353
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,600
I don't need a straw.

354
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,960
Life is just, life is about adapting.

355
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,460
I'm here to adapt to the world.

356
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,810
Bro, okay.

357
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,750
Okay.

358
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,370
Okay, I'm going to say this.

359
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,290
It's not tweet about it.

360
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:14,730
But apparently, after the Super Bowl, 500 private planes
flew out of the state of where the Super Bowl was.

361
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,410
And then we can have plastic straws.

362
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,170
Like, what's the point?

363
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,930
500, no, 600, I'm sorry, I was 100 short.

364
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,950
Like, oh my God.

365
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:41,270
600 private jets, by the way, private planes blew out of the
state of where the Super Bowl was.

366
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,470
But we can't use plastic straws.

367
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,370
Oh, we're the problem here.

368
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,870
We're the fucking problem.

369
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:58,590
think of the environment and I bet three of them is Taylor
Swift's private plane

370
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:09,490
you guys hear about that like Taylor Swift literally flies
on her private jet like every fucking week not even every

371
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,330
other day

372
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:20,230
she literally just flies on her private jet like if she's
like I gotta get my hair done I'm gonna fly to this other

373
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,110
state it's fucking wild

374
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:44,390
that she should my queen but you want her to use her legs
you're close to the truth you monster you freak you want her

375
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:59,870
to walk how much time 17 more minutes it's actually crazy
that they let that happen they they refuse to let us have

376
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:09,850
plastic straws for this this is what my straws died for my
straws died for their sins

377

I see other people always...

392
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,970
I see a lot of people uploading covers on Spotify.

393
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,190
I think it's possible.

394
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,330
I just don't know the process of it.

395
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,250
Like, I know that Amalie uploads a lot of covers on Spotify.

396
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,210
So, there's clearly a process to get it done.

397
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,730
I just don't know what it is.

398
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:19,010
I can't believe they didn't give me a straw.

399
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,910

thank you for the super chat thank you thank you don't

437
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:57,990
forget the lie aspect I actually read the books before
before it became a popular TV show it was very interesting

438
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:05,450
it was very interesting and then I for I didn't realize how
fucked up I was also like you know really young when I

439
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:10,450
should not have been reading books but it was like you know
like when bookstores because i used to go used to go to a

440
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:17,870
bookstore a lot and um they would put like bestsellers and
pretty little lives was like bestseller and then i was

441
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:27,470
definitely way too young to be reading those books i because
like you know i was like oh my god that's so that's so oh my

442
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:37,990
god forbidden love and i was like oh my god it's no no this
is and that's get oh you know it's like like I won't explain

443
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:45,250
what was the forbidden love but what there was a forbid
there was a forbidden love for some apart and for those who

444
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:52,270
know the pretty little live series I was like oh my god
forbidden love and then as I got older I was like this is

445
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:58,330
this is illegal I was like this is illegal

446
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:30,030
um no way oh dear forbidden forever no it was I can't say
exactly and I can't say exactly what was really bad about it

447
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:41,890
about the premise but if you read the books you know why you
know what as in breaking the law yeah truly forbidden it's

448
00:53:41,890 --> 00:54:01,250
actually illegal but in the books when like in the books
it's like not passed off as like it's really bad so like

449
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:08,070
it's so like it didn't seem like it and then you know when
you get older when you realize how bad that is you're like

450
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:19,450
oh my they did tone it down in the tv show the thing is on
the tv show they toned it down of how actually illegal it

451
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:30,270
was and then but like in the books it's even it's a lot
worse it's a lot worse like i mean like her parents should

452
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:37,910
call the fucking fbi he should be on a list why are there's
why is he not on the list why

453
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:52,470
oh my god okay then

454
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:03,850
oh that kind of legal anyway it became a very popular tv
show with a very catchy opening i should really love the

455
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:19,090
opening what is it called anyway she made millions of
dollars from this from her books got a secret beep it turned

456
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,250
less than insane

457
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:43,210
yeah it's it's a really i find i think the song The song in
the opening.

458
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:45,790
It's really good.

459
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,970
Alright, I finished my schedule, I think.

460
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:53,530
A little off-topic.

461
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,310
I have to say the primal Doki plushie was top tier.

462
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,810
The golden combinations were endless.

463
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,170
Maybe with Doc Shirt's missed opportunity.

464
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,710
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

465
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,070

467
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:09,930
She's gone.

468
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:23,810
The Doki Prototype 1 is God It's like Kill me Say goodbye
Say goodbye to Doki Prime

469
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:40,330

the dumpster Doki name bring her Back She's okay I

470
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:48,470
legitimately don't even think she's she's exists anymore But
if I somehow get a copy of her and I sell am I doing auction

471
00:56:48,470 --> 00:57:02,650
of her would at people actually bid on this would be

00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,170
media Oh

473
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:16,870
Bro it would sell thousands I'll talk to I'll talk to my
distributor and see I'm most likely auction it for charity

474
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,090
most likely

475
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:32,190
okay I've ever read pretty little liars if you read it now
at your like at the age we are now you guys will realize how

476
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:39,990
fucked up that book was but then like it was like geared
towards like young adults slash teens and tweens and stuff

477
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:47,250
and i was definitely way too young to read that but like the
fact that it's geared towards i feel like it was even too

478
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:55,210
young for teenagers and tweens honestly like the premise of
the book like the drama in it was definitely like because

479
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:02,270
like like you know i didn't register how fucking bad that
book is and the book is like pretty messed up when I like

480
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:11,070
processed it as an older as an adult when I processed it and
I was like remembering the storylines um oh yeah and there's

481
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:23,070
incest in there too they're like there's it's like because
like the the spoiler alert from what I remembered um like

482
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:30,670
she had like a brother like like the girl that supposedly
died but she faked her death and then like they were like in

483
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:44,570
like the brother really really liked her like his sister a
lot and yeah that the yeah the pretty little liars is like

484
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:54,990
pretty pretty bad and it was geared towards teens and tweens
it gets really i don't even remember I don't I personally

485
00:58:54,990 --> 00:59:07,770
don't remember like what happened um what happened I don't
remember exactly like um the entire story of pretty little

486
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:14,570
liars but I remember the ah forbidden love I remember the
really fucked up parts because I was like

487
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:24,330
yeah I was reading I remember when I read it I was like oh
and I would keep up to date with it i had like i think i had

488
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:31,030
like seven of the seven of the hard copies because you know
like when the books first come out they would be hard copies

489
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:39,110
um before they get pulled into because they're like the
special edition hard copy copy cover books um because

490
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:44,030
they're like the first releases and then after the first
release the second release are like paperback so i would

491
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:50,630
have the first release hard cover copies of pretty little
liars because i was like oh my god what's gonna happen next

531
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:15,250

532
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:28,980
okay i'm already done downloading the two gigabytes not even
two gigabytes like 1.29 i was wondering why i had the two in

533
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:34,480
there i was like maybe they'll deleted live like they're
like Overwatch and then when you're in the queue they like

534
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:41,540
remove the two it's a little special cinematic or some shit
where they like where the two just disappears

535
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:55,250
alright there you go up there we go now I'm 200 there you go
now the two is God that looks right now

536
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:08,850
look at that the two is God oh oh

537
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,460
it's okay maybe 200 people will have their game crashed

538
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:40,130
maybe there'll be a power outage in one specific city and
then I'll get in I

539
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:58,850
just need to find out which city has the most overwatched
player and then something's gonna happen there's no way it's

540
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:13,550
gonna take two hours guys don't say that don't say that
there's a bunch of drops not not today i feel like the

541
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:16,070
launch is so special it should be on the main channel

542
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:30,060
i know everyone's like super excited though or because it's
like you know i heard like when they announced the five new

543
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:38,000
characters um overwatch like they oh my god there's so many
people streaming overwatch right now but when they first

544
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:56,620
announced the um i'm seeing people on overwatch 2 screens
not just me it's not just me that fell for it people but i

545
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:07,060
saw a lot of people um a lot of people were like uh were
like really excited about the um about the new character

546
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:15,080
drops that like apparently player player bait like the
player count like peaked um like times five what it usually

547
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:21,160
is because everyone was like super excited coming back to
overwatch because of the because they got rid of the two

548
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:35,260
they got rid of the two and everyone's like oh my god the
game i fell in love with is back the two is gone guys No

549
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:35,780
way.

550
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:40,780
I mean, it's the fifth most popular game right now on
Twitch.

551
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,240
That's already, that's a lot.

552
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,720
Oh my god, Tim is not any players in queue.

553
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,400
I swear to God.

554
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:52,340
Of course, of course the partnered streamers have priority.

555
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,340
It's crazy that Tim wasn't in the priority queue.

556
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,580
Of course, of course the partnered.

557
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:07,780
The partner, the partner Overwatch streams get nepotism.

558
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,500
But you see the people who are actually in, in right now,
and you're like, of course they're in.

559
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,900
They got whitelisted.

560
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,700
Coincidence, I think not.

561
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,980
I don't think it's a coincidence.

562
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,680
The Overwatch darlings got in.

563
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:46,020
at least 200 players i don't at least it's not 300 at least
it's not 300

564
01:09:49,640 --> 01:10:04,520
that's that's fine by me the one percenter strikes again
classic one percent hey i'm 300 yeah that's right it sucks

565
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:24,140
to be you that's not true i saw some streamer got 300 that's
not true so in the end as long as i'm not that guy i saw a

566
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:34,460
streamer was 300 so i'm not at least i'm not that guy i've
no idea how long this takes by the way it's been so long i

567
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,540
remember I don't remember.

568
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,440
It's been so long that I do not remember how long this takes

569
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:51,770
But it doesn't look like it's coming down Can you confirm

570

They never mattered.

588
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:33,410
They just wiped me out of existence as if, like, I had no
impact at all.

589
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:34,130
What's the word?

590
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,470
Like, they just wiped me off.

591
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,490
They snapped me out of existence.

592
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:46,290
As if, like, my achievements never existed.

593
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,130
There's a word for that.

594
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:03,590
Oh, my God.

01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:07,810
Oh, my God.

597
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:08,250
Please.

598
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:12,910
I just need 30 players to have their PC crash.

599
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,830
I got the zero in it.

600
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,690
Don't say that.

601
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,410
Don't say that.

602
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,210
It's not gonna fail.

603
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,150
It'll be fine.

604
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:39,750
Don't say that, guys.

605
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,570
It's not gonna crash.

606
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,090
Oh

607
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:09,750
my god, six players!

608
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,450
We're almost there.

609
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:13,430
We're almost at the finish line.

610
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:17,270
We're almost there.

611
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:20,370
2.

612
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:21,590
Oh my god.

613
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:22,970
I'm tapping back in.

614
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:23,930
2.

615
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:25,370
Zero.

616
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:27,270
Come on.

617
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,190
Do something.

618
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:30,650
Searching for game server.

619
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:32,130
Entering game.

620
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:33,350
Oh my god.

621
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:34,050
Oh my god.

622
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:34,450
Oh my god.

623
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:34,930
It's here.

624
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,770
It's here.

625
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:37,970
Entering game.

626
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:39,090
Oh.

627
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,730
All right, this is where this is where they kill Doomfist.

628
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:42,610
Is that Doomfist?

629
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:43,930
Okay, no, it's not.

630
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:46,610
I was like, oh my god, Antonio.

631
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,210
Who's this guy?

632
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:51,470
Oh, her dad!

633
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,450
It's her dad!

634
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,730
Reaper killed him, by the way.

635
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:02,710
It doesn't really help with the happy music, by the way.

636
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:25,630
You're so happy.

637
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:27,570
But now you're gone.

638
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,990
And they've taken everything.

639
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:47,140
You have gathered us all here for ends.

640
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,500
Get to the point.

641
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:57,240
We should have put a stop to Vendera a long time ago.

642
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,140
She's a threat.

643
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,100
I've been tracking her for years.

644
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,180
She's gone from nothing to...

645
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:04,820
to this.

646
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,400
She's building up to some...

647
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:10,400
She's building an army.

648
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,060
I'll see if I can turn off the beach.

649
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,280
There you go.

650
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:20,060
There you go.

651
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,480
You've saved me the trouble.

652
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,640
You're all here.

653
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,720
Ah, Nartia.

654
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,280
What an unexpected pleasure.

655
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,720
You're not welcome here, Ven.

656
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,940
I've earned my right to be here.

657
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,820
Paid for him blood.

658
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,480
But what have you?

659
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,500
I mean, that's what a shadow...

660
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,620
Shadow organizations are.

661
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,440
Oh my god.

662
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,780
Don't stand near the window, Doomfist!

663
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,120
Don't do it!

664
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,540
Don't do it, Doomfist!

665
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,400
That's how they got him!

666
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:20,410
Don't get closer to the window.

667
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:29,810
Bro, Vendera, your DPS do something.

668
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:43,110
Noofus, no, you haven't been DPS for like seven years.

669
01:19:54,350 --> 01:20:00,090
And they said Like a coward, you bear

670
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:17,860
I'm here to take it back You deserve nothing Power is not
passed down It must be seized It's the same guy that was

671
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:25,200
able to predict Tracer's blinks by the way Yeah but back
then DPS, guys.

672
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,240
They slowed him down when he got into a tank.

673
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,700
Because he had to buff up.

674
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,780
He had to swole up as tank, guys.

675
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,280
He lost his speed.

676
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:37,800
Yeah, he got old.

677
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,040
He's slower.

678
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,370
Look, he takes that, though.

679
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,050
He did.

680
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:55,910
He did his job.

681
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,130
You disappointed.

682
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:20,410

684
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:45,870
Don't worry, there's no fall damage in Overwatch, so he'll
be fine.

685
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,010
Not the window.

686
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:55,010
It's okay, guys, there's no fall damage.

687
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,750
He's gonna be fine.

688
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,090
That Moga's like nice.

689
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:01,350
Oh, wait, there's Mora.

690
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:07,110
And the world will kneel.

691
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,270
A new Talon Empire.

692
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:25,530

711
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,450
Oh my God, the Hala Kitty and Friends.

Oh, so during her initial, Sojourner recognizes the threat.

01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:10,930
She won't back down until the job done.

01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:15,250
Oh, I guess like, it's like, um, they restart Overwatch, I
guess.

01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:23,370
Uh, oh, yeah, it's in Hong Kong dollars because I made this

Kong.

fucking upset oh yeah and then i i thought it was so funny

732
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:17,730
that mercy players were complaining about their mythic skin

737
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:19,400
cinnamoro is actually canon in the overwatch universe oh my
god they're actually of course there's mercy Kiriko of

738
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:33,520
course there's mercy Kiriko and Juno they know that the
three supports the three supports gets the fucking highlight

739
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:47,060
intro only those three characters that never get that never
get play of the game it's actually crazy you know they want

740
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:55,500
sell more if they give it to like diva or widow because at
least it's more easy to get play of the game or even lucium

741
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:02,360
if they give it to lucium widow or diva it's easier to get
play of the game to actually see these highlight intros

742
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:10,280
because like I know it's very unless you're like unless
you're playing like DPS Kiriko you're not fucking getting

743
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:19,320
like I rarely ever see highlight like of the game for any of
these characters.

744
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,300
Mind me, stop.

745
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,140
And even then, Lucio, at least he can get it for boops.

746
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,100
At least he can get it for the fucking boops.

747
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,280
That's fucking hilarious.

748
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:40,450
That's why they allow you to see the intro right now.

749
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:47,460
Nah, he doesn't.

750
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,840

That's unlucky.

793
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,370
I wish they didn't reuse that.

794
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,870
Let's see.

795
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,590

796
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:42,650

01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:44,570
Oh, that's what she sounds like.

798
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,990
I wish it was a little deeper.

799
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:49,290
He's stuck there.

800
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:51,670
What a capital idea.

801
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:52,890
She's so posh.

802
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:53,750

01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:06,310
Oh, you'll soon regret that.

808
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:09,450
Yeah, I wish her voice was a little lower.

809
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:12,090
Welcome to my world.

810
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:13,270
Oh my gosh, literally rarity.

811
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:14,350

812
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:15,870
Even like the hairstyle.

813
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:17,990
She's so posh.

814
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:32,570

817
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:50,670

All right, Jetpack hat.

There you are.

820
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:57,550
That's so dumb.

821
01:34:57,970 --> 01:35:00,530
It's actually a fucking...

822
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:02,370
Five by five.

823
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:07,010
They have them to be orange.

824
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:09,710
The aviators, too.

825
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:12,030
Danger zone.

826
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:13,910
Oh, yeah.

827
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:17,930
I heard in the practice range, you can control a little
laser pointer.

828
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:27,050
uh a laser pointer and stuff for him well how does it look
like with the cat oh i can't i think he's not allowed to

my cat mic drop i demand to let my cat microphone drop let

microphone literally unplayable my cat can mic drop what's

832
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:16,690

833
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:20,370

834
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:21,410
Where is Hammond?

835
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:23,330
I need a note.

836
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:25,630
If Hammond can mic drop or not.

837
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:30,390
My god, they're just racist.

838
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:35,530
No rights for cats.

839
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:37,030
It's unfair.

840
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:44,450
He can mic drop but not, but not my cat.

841
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:46,730
Wow, Blizzard.

842
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:51,950
All right, let's see.

843
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:54,310
Apparently someone's like, check out that voice live.

844
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:00,820
That's discrimination.

845
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,900
That's just a volume, okay?

846
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,040
Can you guys hear this?

847
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,140
He's spinning.

848
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,020
He deserves to be able to mic drop.

849
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,000
It come up a little bit.

850
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,000
All right, I'll do that.

851
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,690
That's Ashley's voice.

852
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:44,690
That feels crazy.

853
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:46,110
Actually, it's sounding out of here.

854
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:47,270
Let me know.

855
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:49,930
So I need to, I think, I wonder if they reverted my
settings.

856
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:53,990
Options.

857
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:55,410
Nope.

858
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,330
It's, oh my gosh.

859
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:57,670
Wait, even this looks different.

860
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:59,690
Oh, it's so weird.

861
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,310
I'm not used to it at all.

862
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,360
New 400.

863
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,140
I don't think we're going to get there anyway.

864
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:13,880
This looks a little different.

865
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,980
It's like taller.

866
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:19,720
I don't know.

867
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:23,080
Doesn't it feel, like, taller?

868
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,920
It feels taller.

869
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,460
Ah, Mizuki.

870
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,720
He's a guy, by the way, for those who are wondering.

871
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,240
We're, like, unsure.

872
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,620
I mean, from this, you can tell he's a guy.

873
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,440
From this, it was hard.

874
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,380
This was harder to see.

875
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,460
Because of the haircut.

876
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,660
And, like, he's covering half his face.

877
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:48,900
People were, like, not sure if it was a guy.

878
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:58,380
girl because like also the outfit too like this guy was like
you know he's got it you got to show yeah yeah and then and

879
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,040
then like period this in the air you're like oh yeah it's a
guy it was it's a

880
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:22,930
guy he can mic drop this discrimination towards cats what
does it sound like What the fuck?

881
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:23,550
Wait a minute.

882
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:25,070
Don't jinx it.

883
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:26,570
Be gone spirits.

884
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:28,490
I brought the salt.

885
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:30,810
You should count your blessings.

886
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,490
Got a problem?

887
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,190
Got a problem?

888
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:37,870
You're starting to annoy me.

889
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:45,770
Hey, just a little bit like Genji without the filter.

890
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:48,190
Yeah, doesn't he?

891
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:51,650
He sounds sort of like Genji but without the depression.

892
01:39:51,730 --> 01:40:02,530
we're like kindred spirits doesn't he everyone's got
something to hide yeah like if he was Genji wasn't depressed

893
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:20,070
he sort of sounds like yeah about the depression and the
filter all right we got Mizuki and then Aaron they're gonna

894
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:27,710
change the face by way for those who don't know they're
gonna oh the way it's a panda okay that's cute they made her

895
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:35,070
into a furry that's her persona guys i can't believe her fur
skin she made her into a furry

896
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:45,610
but they're gonna change the face oh my god she's wearing
sneakers too i just noticed that uh but they're gonna change

897
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:54,210
her face to make it fit more like her cinematic what's this
oh that's Because it's literally just Kierko's Kierko slash

898
01:40:54,210 --> 01:41:11,720
Juno Meh I will say this one's pretty meh Like she can mic
drop Why can't all the other characters mic drop?

899
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:24,320
Where is a spark diligence over talent Yellowfish is yeah
The grind never stops I'll burn brightest.

900
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:44,440
I don't know if that's like, I know Faria, Faria voices
asked her.

901
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:47,240
She was like, she's an Overwatch content creator.

902
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:48,560
She basically made it.

903
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:54,320
She basically made it because she was like, she was just an
Overwatch content creator and then she became like a

904
01:41:54,320 --> 01:42:01,160
cosplayer who cosplayed official stuff for people and now
she's like now she's a now they and they picked her they

905
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:19,800
picked her as the overwatch voice actor for our honor and i
think i think like i i will have a little critique for it

906
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:27,380
but she's doing her intonations english intonations instead
of unless like i'm wrong but it feels like because like

907
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:34,140
there's no questioning tone in chinese intonations so it
feels like she's she's doing a lot of english intonations

908
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:45,440
for the chinese for the mandarin but i'm not sure if that's
just me because the ma sounds a bit weird because you're

909
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:55,860
supposed it's like dip down right I remember like You know,
you know, you know, it's like more More down Instead of

910
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:04,480
Instead of like up So like I could tell That's why I was
like playing it You know, you know, you know, she tones it

911
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:13,720
up But in In like, because like in Chinese We have set
intonations So she's supposed to go down So you know, you

912
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:22,880
know, yeah not sure but i'm not sure i haven't like but like
i'm not like super fluent in mandarin but i got i got like

913
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:30,020
made fun of for my intonations when i speak cantonese um
because i use i use the same tonations as her when i'm

914
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:35,560
speaking cantonese and they're like and my friends would
like make fun of me being like you're why are you using why

915
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:44,920

you up to now

916
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:58,520
sure i'm not sure if i'm right or not because i'm not fluent
in uh uh i'm not fluent in mandarin i just knew in cantonese

917
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:05,240
i got my friends would make fun of me because i used the
questioning tone um i used the but it was just that that

918
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:13,080
voice that everything else was like so cool but like it was
just this one ayah you guys gotcha because that's how i hear

919
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:19,480
because That's how my, that's how my, my, my relatives use
it on me.

920
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:29,740
I, I only feel, I instantly recognize it because I've had
that said to me a lot in Mandarin.

921
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,760
So I was just like, oh, my relatives would say, use this
tone at me.

922
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,220
And you guys got some more.

923
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,140
That's why I kept listening to it.

924
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,600
I was like, it sounds weird, right?

925
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,480
It's a spark.

926
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:48,780
It sounds...

927
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,420
A core memory.

928
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:55,660
But yeah.

929
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,840
But yeah, good for her though.

930
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:00,320
She's like, she actually made it.

931
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:06,840
As like an Overwatch content creator leading up to becoming
actually in the game as an official voice actress.

932
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:13,260
And we played Jetpack Cat Bros.

933
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,020
This is why we booted up the game.

934
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:17,080
We're here for Jetpack Cat.

935
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,320
All right, play.

936
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,800
We do...

937
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,760
I do quick play.

938
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:22,800
Support.

939
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:25,640
That's so weird.

940
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:26,540
That's so...

941
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,080
Oh my god.

942
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,880
Oh my god.

943
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:34,520
Wait, that's the tab?

944
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,800
Oh my god, that's so weird.

945
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,820
Oh, I forgot Emory.

946
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,880
But to be fair, everyone forgets Emory.

947
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:50,040
I forgot the, I forgot anti-soldier 76, but everyone forgets
about him.

948
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,420
Everyone forgets about him.

949
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:00,410
Like, who?

950
01:46:02,590 --> 01:46:04,590
Amber sucks, bro.

951
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:15,150
I'd be on my villain arc, too.

952
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:16,070
I don't know.

953
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:16,490

954
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:19,930

Okay, how do you play...

965
01:47:05,570 --> 01:47:06,570

966
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:07,510

I'm sorry.

987
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:25,900
They don't give us their lookout.

988
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,600

I'm trying to figure out how to grab people.

1007
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:01,850
Quick melee becomes empowered every...

1008
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:02,370
Gate up to...

1009
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:02,550

01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,750
Area strike.

1028
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:13,110
They'll never expect the cat from the sky.

1029
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:15,330
Okay, maybe they will.

1030
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:19,510

Do they not trust me?

1039
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,340
See, like that's not fair!

1040
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:26,880

I would not accept.

1047
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:59,470
Why does no one want my grip?

1048
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:04,730
I don't understand.

1049
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:06,710
The cat diff.

1050
01:53:08,130 --> 01:53:10,710
The best cat twins.

1051
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:16,430
Cat diff.

1052
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:19,550
Okay, I think a jet pack hat is really fun.

1053
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:26,010
No one wants to let me grip.

1054
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,080
Why won't they let me grip you?

1055
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,100
Cat grip.

1056
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,460
Let me grip you.

1057
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,600

1058
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,520
How you did, bro?

1059
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:49,820
Okay, guys, yes.

1060
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:53,380
Actually, let me go to practice range because I'm like a
bit.

1061
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,280
confused.

1062
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:55,400
I'm about...

1063
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:03,710

1064
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:05,750
Okay, I need to look at the perks.

1065
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:07,410
Actually...

1066
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:08,410
I think...

1067
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:12,090
Like, I don't understand.

1068
01:54:12,270 --> 01:54:14,770
Why don't they want me to grip you?

1069
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:17,330
Come, accept it.

1070
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:17,930
Accept.

1071
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:19,690
Can Friendlies accept this?

1072
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:21,570
Take the grip!

1073
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:22,550

1074
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:23,510
Take the grip!

1075
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:30,150
They don't let me take the grip.

1076
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:34,730
Alright, let's...

1077
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:37,610
Quick melee becomes ruining enemies for destroying them.

1078
01:54:37,810 --> 01:54:38,770
Quick melee?

1079
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:41,630

01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:55,990
Okay, that's useless That's, I'm sorry, but that's useless I
don't know if that I guess it's your Insta Lucio not Okay,

1105
01:55:56,270 --> 01:55:58,150
that's a Lucio boop, I guess.

1106
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:01,330
You can use that as a Lucio boop, but I feel like that's a
little useless.

1107
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:01,870
All right.

1108
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:04,190
I want to see Mizuki.

1109
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,690
How do I heal?

1110
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:07,570
Is it just this?

1111
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:09,730
No, that doesn't heal.

1112
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:14,710
Ah, my hat.

1113
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:18,250
All right.

1114
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:20,270
But it's funny, though.

1115
01:56:22,210 --> 01:56:22,870
All right.

1116
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:25,150
I have health regeneration delay.

1117
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:28,430
Throw your hat, bounce on nearby healing you when it
returns.

1118
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:31,390
Launch a chain that hinders the first enemy.

1119
01:56:33,110 --> 01:56:35,670
Oh, I have passive AoE healing.

1120
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:38,130
Oh, I do.

1121
01:56:40,270 --> 01:56:41,470
Oh, so it's like Lucio.

1122
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:48,330
Yeah, heals nearby healing skills with resources generated
by dealing damage and healing.

1123
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:50,190
So if I do enough damage and healers.

1124
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:50,950
Oh.

1125
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:55,010
Inbind, a paper doll reacted to return and gain increased.

1126
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:55,330
Okay.

1127
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:58,230
This one is a little more difficult than a flying fucking
cat

1128
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:08,490
This is a little more difficult than a flying cat Someone
says, is she new to Overwatch?

1129
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:12,950
Let me show you Does this look like I'm new to Overwatch?

1130
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:18,870
If you recognize that icon, then you'll know the answer

1131
01:57:26,890 --> 01:57:43,310
Alright all right let's see uh leave forward leaving behind
well the thing is i was like a quick melee but i don't have

1132
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:50,750
an ability for melee and i realized by picking that perk it
gave me the ability for the melee so i was like confused uh

1133
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:56,950
leave forward leaving behind reactive rate to return and
gain increased speed launch a chain that hinders the first

1134
01:57:56,950 --> 01:58:06,310
okay so it's like a rival rival thing is it what is it i
guess like are you not able to move after that i wish i can

1135
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:14,470
just select it i don't have to go back yeah i guess like
okay base tank what does it t there would they be stuck i

1136
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:26,970
guess they'll be stuck i guess uh leap forward and all right
and then oh all right that's interesting do i do you can you

1137
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:30,910
see me when i'm in that Oh, oh!

1138
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:31,790
Reacting, oh!

1139
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:36,730
Okay, so I can just like, I can go in and then just beat
that.

1140
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:40,230
Is there a timer?

1141
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:45,450
It is a timer, so if I don't do it, I have to...

1142
01:58:45,450 --> 01:58:46,210
Alright, I see.

1143
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:50,330
And then I don't need to look at my ult, because like, I
know what the ult does.

1144
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:52,870
And then...

1145
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:54,650
Okay, that's cool.

1146
01:58:57,090 --> 01:58:58,030
Can I press F1?

1147
01:58:58,030 --> 01:58:58,630
Oh, I can!

1148
01:58:58,730 --> 01:59:07,170
here okay yeah about to hold it all right what side of my
perks hitting remedy aura resource generation is increased

1149
01:59:07,170 --> 01:59:16,470
by 25 hitting enemy increases your damage dealt to them i
guess it depends if you won't be aggressive or defensive i

1150
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:23,610
guess healing bounces one addition each bounce increases
when callus returns active allies with and is increased

1151
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:32,230
increase i feel like while katashiro's return is active So,
like, if I use this, everyone has increased movement.

1152
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:36,090
That would be good if I'm, like, trying to be super
aggressive.

1153
01:59:40,890 --> 01:59:45,350
I mean, it seems cool when I want to be super active.

1154
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,250
Boop.

1155
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:48,130
Alright.

1156
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:50,250
So that is his ability.

1157
01:59:50,590 --> 01:59:51,530
Alright, what are the others?

1158
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:55,350
Domina.

1159
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:57,130
Alright, Domina.

1160
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:06,610
Construct a segmented barrier, push enemies back, stun them
when they hit a wall, project an explosive, and reactivate

1161
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:07,930
to detonate it.

1162
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:14,590
Dealing damage with abilities, restore shields, reduces,
fires a hard like that imprisons enemy and detonates on

1163
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:15,390
expiration.

1164
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:18,030
Oh, wait, this is tracking.

1165
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:19,690
Oh, that's fucking easy.

1166
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:24,850
It's like tracking and I guess like hit scan, right?

1167
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:26,470
Okay, is this projectile or hit scan?

1168
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:26,890
Let's see.

1169
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:30,970
How far is the range?

1170
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:32,030
It's not that far.

1171
02:00:32,890 --> 02:00:35,110
So, like, yeah, you have to...

1172
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:35,370
Okay.

1173
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:36,890
It's not that far.

1174
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:41,030
I wish your voice was a little lower, not gonna lie.

1175
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:43,690
I did not expect this voice.

1176
02:00:45,290 --> 02:00:46,190
Yeah, it feels like...

1177
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:47,650
It does feel like Ultron's gun.

1178
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:48,590
Yeah, it is Ultron.

1179
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:50,210
It doesn't feel like it is.

1180
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:54,550
But it's easier because you're not flying the fucking air.

1181
02:00:57,470 --> 02:00:58,210
It's easy.

1182
02:00:58,730 --> 02:01:05,290
the easy version of Ultron's gun because you're not in the
fucking air while trying to control that.

1183
02:01:08,410 --> 02:01:11,970
True, because you don't have to go like up, down, left,
right.

1184
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:15,150
You just have, I guess you have crouch, but that's it.

1185
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:16,690
I almost forgot you crouch here.

1186
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:18,390
Let's see.

1187
02:01:18,590 --> 02:01:20,210
What is this?

1188
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:22,230
Oh, so that's the detonation.

1189
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:24,550
And then there's my shield.

1190
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:26,490
Oh, okay.

1191
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:27,450
There's the shield.

1192
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:31,970
Okay, I have to, like, time that, though.

1193
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:34,310
And then that's the boop.

1194
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:38,510
I feel like this is hard.

1195
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:42,850
Yeah, okay, this you gotta be able to time that correctly.

1196
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:44,550
And there's my barrier.

1197
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:46,550
I would fuck around with that.

1198
02:01:46,870 --> 02:01:48,110
I would fuck up that, too.

1199
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:50,490
Yeah, they dropped five heroes at once.

1200
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:54,550
After using barrier, restore 50 shields and active passive
health regeneration.

1201
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:57,810
After using restore 50 shields and activate passive.

1202
02:01:57,930 --> 02:01:58,250
Okay.

1203
02:01:58,730 --> 02:01:59,850
Increase the range.

1204
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:01,250
If I want to be...

1205
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:02,250
Ah, that's hard.

1206
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:04,050
After Restore...

1207
02:02:05,230 --> 02:02:06,490
It's like, this is...

1208
02:02:06,490 --> 02:02:07,690
Left is playing for the team.

1209
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:09,330
Right is playing for me.

1210
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:13,570
This is...

1211
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:14,390
This is...

1212
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:15,770
I don't care about the team.

1213
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:19,290
There's me getting health charge.

1214
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,450
Alright, what's the other one?

1215
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:28,130
Enemies hit by crystal charge are slowed for very mused as a
wall is stunned enemies.

1216
02:02:28,770 --> 02:02:30,110
With a one-weight.

1217
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:31,250
Oh!

1218
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:35,570
Oh, that right side would be like a skill thing.

1219
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:41,730
I feel like right would be a skill thing to work on.

1220
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:45,510
Because like being able to time the barrier is like an Emma
Frost thing.

1221
02:02:45,690 --> 02:02:49,530
So being able to time the barrier and then using the Sonic
thing on it.

1222
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,510
And it hit his fire.

1223
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:54,990
So this one will be easier to do on paper.

1224
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:58,050
Oh, on paper.

1225
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:13,070
on paper there you go and then you slowed on paper indeed

1226
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:23,670
all right the youtube's plush oh the youtube's plush is live

that's a strong-ass combo What is the right?

1231
02:04:08,210 --> 02:04:09,270
That didn't be too close for that.

1232
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:17,550
Yeah, I do She seems very she seems very strong like I think
the shift e combo is really good It's really scary in

1233
02:04:17,550 --> 02:04:31,890
general I think that's a scary combo Like if I do this And
then Like I feel like if I can get that off that would be a

1234
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:36,270
strong ignite burn Can anyone use your ultimate for each
enemy ignited by it?

1235
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:47,230
Oh my wait, that's so p I'm gonna go right right seems

1241
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:37,000
Gun guy number two.

1242
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:38,440
What is Call of Duty?

1243
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:39,420
The other's battlefield.

1244
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:41,000
This is battlefield, man.

1245
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,780
Throw a grenade at the enemy shortly after bouncing.

1246
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:44,560
The fuck?

1247
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:45,880
All right.

1248
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:47,880
Transforming you into a living weapon.

1249
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:48,780
Oh, is this a Punisher?

1250
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,100
Three round burst weapon.

1251
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:53,060
To hold the zoom in.

1252
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:53,680
Tightening accuracy.

1253
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:55,080
Increasing fallout.

1254
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,120
This is battlefield, man.

1255
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:58,800
Yeah.

1256
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,340

We finally have Halo Man.

1264
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:14,000
Your grenade.

1265
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:18,480
Passive regeneration after your sooner and still restores 30
health when activated.

1266
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:20,520
Alright, let's try them out.

1267
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:23,020
Okay.

1268
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:24,880
Holy shit.

1269
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:25,940

02:18:59,650 --> 02:19:01,610
Oh, you're crazy for that.

1408
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:03,310
Your fact that you're still alive.

02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:07,920

I'm so close to it.

1414
02:19:20,910 --> 02:19:22,390
I will kill you.

1415
02:19:24,990 --> 02:19:26,270
I will kill this cat.

1416
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:28,070
If it's the last thing I do.

1417
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:29,930
The cat's dead.

1418
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:35,410
I did it.

1419
02:19:37,390 --> 02:19:39,770
I told you, I will kill the cat.

1420
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,800
It's not the cat.

1421
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,000
Cat down.

1422
02:19:50,380 --> 02:19:52,080
I repeat, cat down.

1423
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:57,780
Cat is down.

1424
02:19:58,340 --> 02:19:59,400
Cat is down.

1425
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:06,530
Uh-oh.

1426
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:12,750
Rising from the ashes.

1427
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:14,010
Are you feeling more powerful?

1428
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:15,870
I hear him.

1429
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:16,810
This won't take long.

1430
02:20:20,350 --> 02:20:21,310
Hey, what the?

1431
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:23,170

02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:32,170
Where's the cat?

1435
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:34,170
Enemy's got the robot.

1436
02:20:35,110 --> 02:20:35,910
Let's change that.

1437
02:20:36,070 --> 02:20:39,450
I swear, see, guys, I swear I am literally the only one
shooting him.

1438
02:20:40,050 --> 02:20:46,230
Like, I don't think I'm...

1439
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:51,510
Oh, I'm dead.

1440
02:20:51,690 --> 02:20:52,290
I'm so dead.

1441
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:54,070
I'm so fucking dead.

1442
02:20:54,610 --> 02:20:56,090
Run, cat, or what?

1443
02:20:57,550 --> 02:21:00,170
I'm the only one that's doing anything.

1444
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:02,350
Gamers, don't look up.

1445
02:21:02,710 --> 02:21:05,450
I swear, I just need one more person to look up.

1446
02:21:05,790 --> 02:21:07,270
And then we can kill the cat.

1447
02:21:07,690 --> 02:21:09,110
We can kill...

1448
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:15,010
I just need one more person to look at him.

1449
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:21,050
I'm the only one that cares.

1450
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:25,440
I got him.

1451
02:21:25,580 --> 02:21:26,300
I got my one.

1452
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:27,060
I got my one.

1453
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:28,100
I think we might lose.

1454
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:28,650
I think...

1455
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:31,860
I got my one.

1456
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:37,180
Looking up is hard.

1457
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:38,400
Apparently so!

1458
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:41,100
Apparently he is.

1459
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:42,440
Yeah!

1460
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:43,420
We won!

1461
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:48,160
I feel like I did so much damage, but like not kills.

1462
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:58,440
final blows play of the game i feel like i spent all my time
just shooting a cat

1463
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:14,110
yeah it's five and five i don't understand why is it why is
my cat frontlining and their cat is 200 miles away and yet

1464
02:22:14,110 --> 02:22:25,890
i'm the only one that's trying to kill him i i felt like i
was the only The only one making an attempt to shoot the

1465
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:26,350
cat.

1466
02:22:28,310 --> 02:22:30,290
No one else wanted to shoot him.

1467
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:33,830
It's fun.

1468
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:36,190
It's literally like I'm playing Halo.

1469
02:22:37,330 --> 02:22:38,790
Across the universe.

1470
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:47,050
I don't want to play OpenQ because OpenQ is just hell, I
feel like.

1471
02:22:47,410 --> 02:22:48,790
OpenQ is too chaotic for me.

1472
02:22:48,850 --> 02:22:51,130
I like to have some system.

1473
02:22:51,310 --> 02:22:52,170
You know, some...

1474
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:55,010
I like it.

1475
02:22:55,030 --> 02:23:01,930
when games have like some form of control and system in
place uh instead of pure anarchy

1476
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:18,910
i don't really like the anarchy part of it yes some some
form of control yeah apparently with the weight a little bit

1477
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:26,930
the joint oh my god wait actually i want to okay after this
game Let's make, I don't want to play, I don't know.

1478
02:23:27,170 --> 02:23:28,790
I don't like playing tank overall.

1479
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:30,410
The only tank I like to play is Zarya.

1480
02:23:31,030 --> 02:23:33,890
I don't like playing shield tanks because it's just too many
buttons.

1481
02:23:36,070 --> 02:23:39,490
But I'm going to make a custom lobby after this game, so get
ready, guys.

1482
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:40,810
And then it's all cats.

1483
02:23:41,230 --> 02:23:42,570
It's all jetpack cats.

1484
02:23:46,690 --> 02:23:50,050
It's all, we're going to have, we're going to play Ace
Combat.

1485
02:23:54,930 --> 02:23:56,370
Is it Ashley Forever Frozen?

1486
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:59,190
Last time it happened, it like slowly, yeah.

1487
02:23:59,390 --> 02:24:01,050
cat foot

1488
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:06,990
oops all cat

1489
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:18,490
honestly jetpack cat is so fun but i know like it's fun
because i'm doing quick play i feel like i feel like if it

1490
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:25,530
was like um if it was rank i will not have fun with jetpack
cat because i feel like at that point at that elo people

1491
02:24:25,530 --> 02:24:28,510
will look up people actually will shoot the cat down

1492
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:46,610
feel like like I will not live in the sky at all it's like
playing ultra you have to be like super cautious oh my god

1493
02:24:46,610 --> 02:24:57,250
do I just restart or just leave game I'm gonna leave game
does it seem like it's gonna start all right let's queue up

1494
02:24:57,250 --> 02:25:10,350
again that's UI is so weird I'm not used to it versus join
talent or join a fucking course i'll join talent oh but then

1495
02:25:10,350 --> 02:25:21,770
all the cool kids are god uh wait jetpack cat is on
overwatch oh my god it's 50 50 as it should be okay we let

1496
02:25:21,770 --> 02:25:32,470

jetpack cat is on overwatch though oh that's so hard

1497
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:38,890
Oh, man.

1498
02:25:39,730 --> 02:25:42,830
Do I join evil or do I join cat?

1499
02:25:44,170 --> 02:25:45,450
It's not even over.

1500
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:46,390
I should just cat.

1501
02:25:49,890 --> 02:25:54,370
Are you telling me the cat is cat over evil?

1502
02:26:03,050 --> 02:26:05,230
The cat always wins.

1503
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:08,910
If cat always wins, why is it 50-50?

1504
02:26:12,170 --> 02:26:13,790
Are you kidding me?

1505
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:15,610
Second time in a row?

1506
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:19,140
Really?

1507
02:26:22,850 --> 02:26:24,350
Oh, my God.

1508
02:26:24,890 --> 02:26:25,930
I can't believe it.

1509
02:26:32,190 --> 02:26:33,610
Second time in a row.

1510
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:36,110

1539
02:29:45,790 --> 02:29:49,030
Like, I actually have to, like, think about what I'm
pressing.

1540
02:29:51,010 --> 02:29:51,970
She's like...

02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:56,290

We had a good stream.

1586
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:32,640
When you're... Otherwise it's in history.

1587
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:34,780
Yeah, I try to go to history, but then they were like...

1588
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:34,980
Nope.

1589
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:39,920
I want to try Mizuki now.

1590
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:43,380
I want to try Mizuki.

1591
02:35:44,220 --> 02:35:44,880
And then we try.

1592
02:35:45,020 --> 02:35:46,100
I don't... I'll play it.

1593
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:47,000
Oh, I forgot!

02:35:47,420 --> 02:35:48,440
The custom room!

1595
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:49,560
Alright, after Mizuki.

1596
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:54,740
After Mizuki, we'll go into her custom room.

1597
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:08,740
It's been fun, though.

1598
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:14,000
I'm actually having a lot of fun with the new characters,
but then I feel like... I do feel like the moment I get into

1599
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,680
Rek, I will not have fun anymore.

1600
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:30,400
I feel like the moment...

1601
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:34,020
The moment I get into Rek, it won't be fun no more.

1602
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:50,600
oh my gosh just push i just use this for speed what is my
range anyway i don't know what my range is i don't see

1603
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:54,780
that's not fair it's not fair

1604
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:03,720
stupid okay that's my

1605
02:37:07,430 --> 02:37:12,070
oh wait There you go.

1606
02:37:12,410 --> 02:37:16,210
Sorry, I have to remember the... Oh my god, they killed our
cat!

1607
02:37:24,010 --> 02:37:24,290
Okay.

1608
02:37:28,570 --> 02:37:30,350
Oh my god, I can't do anything about it.

1609
02:37:30,610 --> 02:37:31,770
I can't do anything about it.

1610
02:37:31,830 --> 02:37:35,130
Okay, Mizuki is hard when nobody's bunched up together.

1611
02:37:35,730 --> 02:37:42,210
Like, I will say, our cat our cat left us.

1612
02:37:44,350 --> 02:37:46,590
He was for some reason frontlining.

1613
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:51,750
Playing Sombra in quick play.

1614
02:37:54,210 --> 02:37:55,970
I don't think our...

1615
02:37:55,970 --> 02:37:58,390
I think our cat is struggling, guys.

1616
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:02,890
Don't worry, my presence is here to heal you.

1617
02:38:03,450 --> 02:38:05,630
Like, this is all I can do.

1618
02:38:06,190 --> 02:38:08,190
I can just stand next to you.

1619
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:13,050
Oh my god, even see him.

1620
02:38:14,090 --> 02:38:16,570
Who the fuck plays Sombra in quick play?

1621
02:38:19,710 --> 02:38:34,110
There's so many funny new characters You play Sombra Oh my

1622
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:41,410
gosh, I went to the left I bounced to the left by accident

1623
02:38:47,490 --> 02:38:56,890
Holy shit, my damage is crazy though For this There we go I
can't kill the cat!

1624
02:39:02,550 --> 02:39:03,210
Oh my god, not me.

1625
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:17,920
Oh my god.

1626
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:19,220
That's crazy.

1627
02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:20,340
The amount of...

1628
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:21,540
I panicked off the...

1629
02:39:21,540 --> 02:39:22,720
I thought there was more of them.

1630
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:26,300
I thought there was more of them.

1631
02:39:26,820 --> 02:39:28,080
I panicked off the that.

1632
02:39:31,180 --> 02:39:33,240
This cat is just diving.

1633
02:39:47,430 --> 02:39:51,930
I keep thinking I have to like hit him.

1634
02:39:52,410 --> 02:39:55,070
But like I just need to...

1635
02:39:55,070 --> 02:39:56,730
I need to remember that.

1636
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:01,600
I need to remember.

1637
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:06,820
I need to remember my left click that's not here.

1638
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:10,680
Holy shit!

1639
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:17,680
Man, I'm out.

1640
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:21,600
Holy shit.

1641
02:40:22,100 --> 02:40:24,160
I keep trying to heal them with my sight.

1642
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:26,360
I'm like, don't worry, guys.

1643
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:27,940
I can heal you.

1644
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:32,060
I'm flying high noon.

1645
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:34,140
It's not fair.

1646
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:42,100
I'm so used to healing, like, shooting equals heal.

1647
02:40:43,500 --> 02:40:44,780
I just want to do that.

1648
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:46,560
The barricade is moving along.

1649
02:40:53,610 --> 02:40:54,030
Okay.

1650
02:40:54,810 --> 02:40:56,910
I need to like be careful here.

1651
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:00,370
Where the fuck?

1652
02:41:01,630 --> 02:41:03,230
I'm trying to like...

1653
02:41:04,110 --> 02:41:06,930
Oh, I wasn't sure exactly.

1654
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:17,220
Jesus, this is so weird.

1655
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:20,540
I don't know, Mizuki is so weird to play in general.

1656
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:21,500
I feel like...

1657
02:41:24,780 --> 02:41:26,420
God, he's so weird.

1658
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:27,820
He's so weird.

1659
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:38,860
Like, his heal is, like, very dependent on your other
teammate, I feel.

1660
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:41,360
I'm just not used to it.

1661
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:46,000
I didn't, like, not waste his projectile.

1662
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:47,640
I don't like his projectile either, too.

1663
02:41:48,140 --> 02:41:49,540
Not a fan of the projectile.

1664
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:51,380
Not very good at it.

1665
02:41:55,830 --> 02:41:57,510
God's right, what you gotta do now?

1666
02:41:58,170 --> 02:41:59,290
Oh, my God, I almost died.

1667
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:03,630
That's right.

1668
02:42:04,970 --> 02:42:05,730
Oh, that's our cat.

1669
02:42:08,350 --> 02:42:10,990
Like, it's slower than Kiri, I feel.

1670
02:42:11,730 --> 02:42:12,170
I don't know.

1671
02:42:12,370 --> 02:42:14,290
She feels slower than Kiri.

1672
02:42:15,410 --> 02:42:15,890
IMO.

1673
02:42:19,890 --> 02:42:20,650
Don't worry.

1674
02:42:20,950 --> 02:42:21,770
You got the hat.

1675
02:42:23,070 --> 02:42:24,190
Wait, as active allies.

1676
02:42:24,390 --> 02:42:25,510
He found.

1677
02:42:25,770 --> 02:42:25,950
Okay.

1678
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:26,750
I don't know.

1679
02:42:26,810 --> 02:42:28,450
I don't know if this is good, but...

1680
02:42:29,650 --> 02:42:30,270
Oh, my God.

1681
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:30,590
See?

1682
02:42:31,010 --> 02:42:32,430
I'm like fucking...

1683
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:45,690
Oh my god, he's doing it.

1684
02:42:46,130 --> 02:42:46,890
He's doing it.

1685
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:49,050
No!

1686
02:42:50,810 --> 02:42:51,910
Someone shoot him!

1687
02:42:52,170 --> 02:42:53,290
He's in the air!

1688
02:42:55,910 --> 02:42:57,590
Someone shoot him!

1689
02:42:59,930 --> 02:43:01,670
I don't know that.

1690
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:02,230
I don't know.

1691
02:43:02,350 --> 02:43:09,790
I'm not a huge i don't know he feels weird he just feels
really weird to play in general yes interesting movement

1692
02:43:09,790 --> 02:43:14,250
tech i will say his movement is very interesting

1693
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:25,360
i'm dead though i'm so dead i went for it

1694
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:40,240
i was just stuck there let's change that like he can't even
he has no he has no mobility I think that's what's it his

1695
02:43:40,240 --> 02:43:48,500
only mobility is a shift so I'm not really his only mobility
is actually his shift so like I don't know it's also he's

1696
02:43:48,500 --> 02:44:01,240
very like the skill ceiling for him is pretty high like like
that that's my only mobility but it's not like a lot in

1697
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:09,060
general like the fact that my my my It's passive, but it
feels not a lot.

1698
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:09,820
Or passive?

1699
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:11,260
If you get what I mean.

1700
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:17,620
It doesn't feel a lot.

1701
02:44:18,220 --> 02:44:20,320
For the amount of heals that I could be doing.

1702
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:26,180
That makes sense.

1703
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:34,030
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

1704
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,890
I'm so sorry.

1705
02:44:36,030 --> 02:44:37,910
I thought my thing, my left...

1706
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:40,030
I legitimately thought my left click was the heal.

1707
02:44:43,250 --> 02:44:44,170
I thought...

1708
02:44:44,170 --> 02:44:44,870
I'm sorry.

1709
02:44:45,310 --> 02:44:48,210
I was left clicking my heal, but I wasn't.

1710
02:44:52,610 --> 02:44:55,030
The aura does feel really weak.

1711
02:45:01,470 --> 02:45:02,670
Are you?

1712
02:45:03,530 --> 02:45:03,930
No!

1713
02:45:04,690 --> 02:45:06,830
He gets me out of everyone!

1714
02:45:07,550 --> 02:45:07,950
Really?

1715
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:09,510
Really?

1716
02:45:09,810 --> 02:45:12,090
He randomly picks me up!

1717
02:45:12,690 --> 02:45:14,410
You know you can't control it?

1718
02:45:15,310 --> 02:45:28,250
control it by the way for that the fact that like oh my god
he actually got me it's always me i'm always

1719
02:45:35,370 --> 02:45:46,190
it's always i'm not watching it anyway i hate i don't like
missuki i don't like i don't know i think you could play if

1720
02:45:46,190 --> 02:45:51,510
you're really i think if the i think he's just gonna His
left click feels so fucking weird.

1721
02:45:52,010 --> 02:45:52,970
His projectile feels weird.

1722
02:45:53,170 --> 02:45:54,630
It's, like, slower than Kiriko.

1723
02:45:57,310 --> 02:46:01,090
The fact that he picks the closest one, and I'm the closest
out of everybody.

1724
02:46:03,910 --> 02:46:04,490
Um.

1725
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:06,470
He...

1726
02:46:06,470 --> 02:46:09,530
He feels very comm-specific, but he feels...

1727
02:46:09,530 --> 02:46:09,790
His...

1728
02:46:09,790 --> 02:46:12,110
His heels feel so slow.

1729
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:16,390
His heels feels incredibly slow in general.

1730
02:46:16,830 --> 02:46:17,450
So...

1731
02:46:18,570 --> 02:46:20,390
And he's not fun to play.

1732
02:46:21,350 --> 02:46:23,770
I don't think the...

1733
02:46:23,770 --> 02:46:26,310
I don't find him fun to play in general.

1734
02:46:26,670 --> 02:46:30,190
Because I don't feel satisfied even when I hit somebody.

1735
02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:33,710
Like playing Jetpack Cat was fucking fun as hell.

1736
02:46:34,170 --> 02:46:36,570
But like, Mizuki just felt...

1737
02:46:37,750 --> 02:46:38,410
I don't know.

1738
02:46:38,530 --> 02:46:39,110
He just...

1739
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:40,230
He's definitely hard.

1740
02:46:40,350 --> 02:46:41,710
I mean, you could say skill diff.

1741
02:46:41,950 --> 02:46:42,830
But like...

1742
02:46:44,550 --> 02:46:46,310
He feels like...

1743
02:46:46,310 --> 02:46:48,550
Like me existing heals people.

1744
02:46:48,570 --> 02:47:00,010
but it sucks when you're looking at them and that's all you
can do yeah and like I feel like I feel like obviously it's

1745
02:47:00,010 --> 02:47:06,990
like damage wise it depends on your damage so I have to do
more damage but it's so hard to do damage on Mizuki because

1746
02:47:06,990 --> 02:47:15,130
I don't understand his projectile speed I think like I feel
like yeah but Lucy is more fun Lucy is very fun to play I

1747
02:47:15,130 --> 02:47:24,450
think like Mizuki is just not moment and I but like each of
the character I played like but like each character I think

1748
02:47:24,450 --> 02:47:33,270
like like jetpack had fun playing on on run I had a lot of
fun playing Aaron and run at air oh my gosh I don't even I

1749
02:47:33,270 --> 02:47:41,210
can't I remember his name what's his name uh emmer emmer I
had fun playing currently Mizuki I don't have fun playing

1750
02:47:41,210 --> 02:47:50,630
Mizuki he's just he's just like I don't know like he is hard
to play Like, maybe if I get to know his projectile speed

1751
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:51,930
and his playstyle, I'll have more fun.

1752
02:47:52,150 --> 02:47:57,850
But as a first-time tryout for him, I'm having, like, a hard
time playing this guy.

1753
02:47:59,490 --> 02:48:04,490
Because, like, also, like, yeah, like, God, goddamn cat.

1754
02:48:09,810 --> 02:48:11,550
He's so weird to play.

1755
02:48:11,830 --> 02:48:13,330
The goddamn fucking cat, though.

1756
02:48:16,110 --> 02:48:16,950
Yeah, it might.

1757
02:48:17,170 --> 02:48:18,550
Yeah, you need another healer to do a hard...

1758
02:48:18,570 --> 02:48:24,610
heart but my cat was fucking flanking so i was the main
healer what i feel like i should have been i feel like

1759
02:48:24,610 --> 02:48:33,690
jetpack cat is i mizuki feels like a flex support and
jetpack cat is more of a i i'd be like oh my god i'm feeling

1760
02:48:33,690 --> 02:48:45,010
am i i'm feeling oh my god he does not care that the he does
not care at all that there's five new characters

1761
02:48:48,570 --> 02:48:56,030
custom game i just figured we stopped domina we'll just do
domina and then we'll do the custom game the perfect world

1762
02:48:56,030 --> 02:49:02,890
is shaped by my hair just wants to be junk right why that's
why junk right gets all the skins shall we his fan base is

1763
02:49:02,890 --> 02:49:06,530
very dedicated yeah

1764
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:15,980
i don't know masuki definitely if i know his projectile
speed i definitely will have more fun but he was so hard to

1765
02:49:15,980 --> 02:49:18,640
play it's so hard to do damage in general

1766
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:30,500
Okay, he felt incredibly hard to do damage he also lack of

Wait, what the fuck?

1862
02:56:45,300 --> 02:56:46,840
The minion can just walk.

1863
02:56:47,060 --> 02:56:47,920
It's just walking.

1864
02:56:50,300 --> 02:56:51,780
Wait, why are we fighting here?

1865
02:56:51,940 --> 02:56:52,860
Oh, that's awkward.

1866
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:11,660
How did my team already die?

1867
02:57:12,740 --> 02:57:13,520

1868
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:17,440

1872
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:25,340
My team is actually useless.

1874
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:29,540

Okay.

1877
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:36,880

03:04:12,580 --> 03:04:14,640
That's just... That's the name.

1942
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:18,180
Jetpack Cat.

1943
03:04:20,060 --> 03:04:20,640
Alright, map.

1944
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:22,860
It has to be... Okay, none.

1945
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:26,940
And then I feel like Ilios is the perfect one.

1946
03:04:27,380 --> 03:04:28,200
Is it Lighthouse?

1947
03:04:28,460 --> 03:04:29,940
Is it lighthouse or ruins?

1948
03:04:30,140 --> 03:04:30,720
That's the better.

1949
03:04:31,720 --> 03:04:32,440
Which one's the best?

1950
03:04:32,720 --> 03:04:33,080
Lighthouse?

1951
03:04:34,420 --> 03:04:35,520
Wait, not lighthouse.

1952
03:04:36,560 --> 03:04:37,360
Which one's the best?

1953
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:38,720
Oh, well.

1954
03:04:39,440 --> 03:04:39,920
We could...

1955
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:42,580
Well, so we could drag them into the pit.

1956
03:04:45,140 --> 03:04:47,520
It's like a little crane machine.

1957
03:04:47,720 --> 03:04:49,500
We can actually crane machine them.

1958
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:51,200
Cran machine the cat.

1959
03:04:54,160 --> 03:04:55,000
Alright, here we go.

Wait, okay.

2079
03:13:48,070 --> 03:13:49,070
We have to start the lobby.

2080
03:13:49,270 --> 03:13:49,910
Give me a sec.

2081
03:13:50,370 --> 03:13:50,730
Show it up.

2082
03:13:50,870 --> 03:13:51,750
Start game mode.

2083
03:13:54,310 --> 03:13:55,390
Alright, we start for real.

2084
03:14:03,250 --> 03:14:03,870
Here we go.

2085
03:14:04,450 --> 03:14:05,690
He is so fun to play.

2086
03:14:05,790 --> 03:14:06,650
He really is.

2087
03:14:09,830 --> 03:14:11,330
There's just, I don't know.

2088
03:14:11,390 --> 03:14:12,610
There's just something about it.

2089
03:14:12,690 --> 03:14:15,130
I think he's the best character ever designed.

2090
03:14:15,490 --> 03:14:17,010
He really is, chat.

2091
03:14:17,590 --> 03:14:19,990
He is literally like peak character design.

2092
03:14:20,510 --> 03:14:22,230
And it's just a cat on a jetpack.

2093
03:14:22,510 --> 03:14:23,910
It's so fucking stupid.

2094
03:14:25,210 --> 03:14:28,030
But yet, but yet it works.

2095
03:14:30,430 --> 03:14:33,010
Yet this concept just works.

2096
03:14:33,790 --> 03:14:34,570

2098
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:41,660
Design is so good.

2116
03:16:29,440 --> 03:16:31,940
I don't know if you saw it, but I actually got him in the
end.

2117
03:16:34,120 --> 03:16:35,120
He's cat bat.

2118
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:40,200
There we go.

2119
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:42,160
Nice.

2120
03:16:43,560 --> 03:16:46,060
These combat's looking really weird.

2121
03:16:47,320 --> 03:16:49,380
It's looking real different.

2122
03:16:52,760 --> 03:16:53,000
Okay.

2123
03:16:53,440 --> 03:16:56,100
The fuel recharges so fast, by the way.

2124
03:16:56,520 --> 03:16:57,440
Oh my god, it's not me!

2125
03:16:57,820 --> 03:16:58,860
Take him to the car!

2126
03:17:02,200 --> 03:17:03,200
He was close.

2127
03:17:03,700 --> 03:17:04,780
He almost got it.

2128
03:17:05,620 --> 03:17:07,120
He actually almost got it.

2129
03:17:07,440 --> 03:17:08,200
Oh, I see you.

2130
03:17:10,180 --> 03:17:12,080
You have to take the fight closer.

2131
03:17:12,220 --> 03:17:13,540
You have to bait them in.

2132
03:17:15,080 --> 03:17:17,140
Everyone's like fighting near the cars now.

2133
03:17:20,460 --> 03:17:21,740
Everyone's just fighting here.

2134
03:17:28,330 --> 03:17:29,770
My kill.

2135
03:17:30,130 --> 03:17:30,270

2136
03:17:31,610 --> 03:17:31,990
Yoink.

2137
03:17:34,150 --> 03:17:35,810
What the fuck?

2138
03:17:36,670 --> 03:17:37,610
That's cheating.

2139
03:17:40,890 --> 03:17:41,690
Oh, no.

2140
03:17:41,710 --> 03:17:43,310
No, I'm so close.

2141
03:17:43,730 --> 03:17:45,030
Ah, I almost made it.

2142
03:17:45,290 --> 03:17:46,270
He's Comcat.

2143
03:17:48,570 --> 03:17:49,890
It's raining, cats.

2144
03:17:55,970 --> 03:17:56,390
Oh, my God.

2145
03:17:56,590 --> 03:17:57,290
He's so close.

2146
03:17:58,890 --> 03:17:59,350
Oh, my God.

2147
03:17:59,710 --> 03:17:59,810
Everybody.

2148
03:18:00,150 --> 03:18:00,250
Wait.

2149
03:18:02,650 --> 03:18:03,810
No, I missed.

2150
03:18:10,350 --> 03:18:11,370
He's so lucky.

2151
03:18:11,630 --> 03:18:12,010
Oh, shit.

2152
03:18:12,090 --> 03:18:12,950
Almost got me.

2153
03:18:16,770 --> 03:18:17,370
There you go.

2154
03:18:18,050 --> 03:18:19,930
There, I couldn't dodge the melee.

2155
03:18:20,090 --> 03:18:21,970
Oh, you missed.

2156
03:18:22,390 --> 03:18:22,790
Bitch.

2157
03:18:24,210 --> 03:18:25,370
That's fucking right.

2158
03:18:25,490 --> 03:18:26,150
You missed.

2159
03:18:27,130 --> 03:18:28,230
You didn't grab me.

2160
03:18:28,610 --> 03:18:30,190
That's a victory in my book.

2161
03:18:39,810 --> 03:18:40,850
Holy shit.

2162
03:18:41,110 --> 03:18:42,610
That was like...

2163
03:18:42,610 --> 03:18:43,510
Those are...

2164
03:18:43,510 --> 03:18:44,150
Did you see that?

2165
03:18:44,230 --> 03:18:45,050
All headshots.

2166
03:18:46,970 --> 03:18:48,710
I'm getting better at aiming with this.

2167
03:18:51,230 --> 03:18:52,290
Bitch, I played Ultron.

2168
03:18:55,950 --> 03:18:57,550
I have to play Ultron.

2169
03:18:58,130 --> 03:18:59,450
I have to aim in the air.

2170
03:19:08,400 --> 03:19:15,410

Oh no, one more killed.

2187
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:58,710
Don't let him have it.

2188
03:21:21,270 --> 03:21:22,750
I got top four though.

2189
03:21:23,210 --> 03:21:24,470
I got top four.

2190
03:21:25,930 --> 03:21:27,750

2191
03:21:28,990 --> 03:21:29,670
The cat.

2192
03:21:29,990 --> 03:21:30,310
The car.

2193
03:21:30,450 --> 03:21:30,850

2194
03:21:31,430 --> 03:21:32,240

2195
03:21:32,910 --> 03:21:33,230

2208
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:09,530

03:22:19,700 --> 03:22:28,540

like it's only on support it's only on quickly the moment

2210
03:22:28,540 --> 03:22:42,000
people figure out how to play rank against this cat it's not

03:22:59,240 --> 03:23:01,420
I'm enjoying it now, guys.

2215
03:23:02,040 --> 03:23:02,620
Anra?

2216
03:23:03,780 --> 03:23:05,680

Yeah, John Halo or Anra.

2220
03:23:16,780 --> 03:23:18,540
It's so stupid.

2221
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:22,800
He's so funny.

2222
03:23:29,570 --> 03:23:39,350
all right she's so crazy Josh I think like a good DPS can
like I'd be really scared to play I think I'd be really

2223
03:23:39,350 --> 03:23:46,210
scared to play against her in rank for sure are they all in
rank too guys are they because usually when it's new

2224
03:23:46,210 --> 03:23:52,690
characters they would like give like a one week trial one
week or two week period but already now are they all

2225
03:23:52,690 --> 03:23:54,690
automatically in rank are

2226
03:23:59,810 --> 03:24:04,890
they I don't know if I want to use up my thing.

2227
03:24:05,950 --> 03:24:09,070
My shift charges fast, though, I will say.

2228
03:24:13,610 --> 03:24:15,970
What the fuck is she here?

2229
03:24:27,210 --> 03:24:29,290
Oh my god, it's Talon time.

2230
03:24:39,350 --> 03:24:41,150
Yeah, bro, that's...

2231
03:24:41,770 --> 03:24:42,490
Where is she?

2232
03:24:48,190 --> 03:24:55,570
I have to think so much when I play her though i will say
that she requires me to actually think really hard

2233
03:25:02,600 --> 03:25:04,700
there you go

2234
03:25:11,340 --> 03:25:19,360

have to there's like so much movement and stuff too and that

2235
03:25:19,360 --> 03:25:27,220
to be aware of she is so really okay

2236
03:25:31,580 --> 03:25:33,080
Oh, so fast

2237
03:25:39,090 --> 03:25:45,870
She felt oh so yeah, I have to lock in for her like I
literally can't talk when I'm playing her because like She

2238
03:25:45,870 --> 03:25:48,810
requires so much concentration in general

2239
03:25:57,150 --> 03:26:09,290
Like So much damage come on What's my other DPS doing?

2240

03:31:59,730 --> 03:32:00,690
Play her correctly.

2293
03:32:01,430 --> 03:32:01,910
For now.

2294
03:32:02,010 --> 03:32:04,010
This is how I feel when I'm playing her, honestly.

2295
03:32:11,420 --> 03:32:11,900
No.

2296
03:32:12,320 --> 03:32:12,640
Fuck.

2297
03:32:14,300 --> 03:32:16,000
Everybody just used every up.

03:32:28,760 --> 03:32:29,120
The cat.

2304
03:32:31,160 --> 03:32:32,340
The cat just needed to heal me.

2305
03:32:32,360 --> 03:32:42,080
to heal me okay i think they can they could go without me my
back hurts so much

2306
03:32:47,700 --> 03:33:00,060

2307
03:33:00,060 --> 03:33:02,300

Oh my god.

2309
03:33:09,420 --> 03:33:11,500
I literally did so much.

2310
03:33:12,600 --> 03:33:14,000
I didn't even try.

2311
03:33:21,920 --> 03:33:23,740
Like, look at that!

2312
03:33:24,520 --> 03:33:25,680
That's insane.

2313
03:33:26,700 --> 03:33:29,240
Like, she's so crazy.

2314
03:33:29,560 --> 03:33:30,680
She actually is.

2315
03:33:33,870 --> 03:33:35,660
My team was...

2316
03:33:35,660 --> 03:33:37,820
My team did not help much.

2317
03:33:37,900 --> 03:33:39,200
I had to do everything.

2318
03:33:44,590 --> 03:33:54,270
oh that's crazy though she's fun i have to say she is fun to
play she's not fun i don't think she's gonna be fun to play

2319
03:33:54,270 --> 03:34:03,650
against um the fact that i could do all of that as someone
that has no experience on anon run imagine like imagine how

2320
03:34:03,650 --> 03:34:14,250
fucking um how fucking hard how fucking strong she is with
an actual dps player yeah like an actual dps player players

2321
03:34:14,250 --> 03:34:23,570
go fucking destroy people the fact that I had no experience
on her it's been a while since I played DPS I feel like

2322
03:34:23,570 --> 03:34:34,130
she's just absolutely broken for now from what I've been
playing she feels really broken I didn't I did enjoy playing

2323
03:34:34,130 --> 03:34:49,750
her I just know that in rank it's gonna be hell hmm for sure
I'm I like her I like her playstyle

2324
03:34:53,510 --> 03:35:03,110
She does so much damage too It's crazy Like the shift E left
click right click You either like maybe like left click

2325
03:35:03,110 --> 03:35:12,230
right click Shift E and then left click right click It's so
much the damage is insane And then I could shift twice too I

2326
03:35:12,230 --> 03:35:19,490
never tried a revival I always been using it as like a I've
been using it as like Engage every time.

2327
03:35:22,350 --> 03:35:22,950
Compared to...

2328
03:35:22,950 --> 03:35:23,790
Can I play...

2329
03:35:23,790 --> 03:35:24,530
I'm DPSK.

2330
03:35:24,570 --> 03:35:26,170
Everybody wants to be Jetpack Cat.

2331
03:35:26,670 --> 03:35:27,990
I'm creating support after this.

2332
03:35:29,210 --> 03:35:30,430
Everyone wants to be...

2333
03:35:30,430 --> 03:35:31,430
Well, I'm voting this.

2334
03:35:32,330 --> 03:35:32,950
That's right.

2335
03:35:33,470 --> 03:35:36,470
I want to escort Dorado.

2336
03:35:37,530 --> 03:35:39,210
Oh, I like how there's Talon...

2337
03:35:39,210 --> 03:35:41,550
Like, Talon flags on here now.

2338
03:35:44,650 --> 03:35:47,270
Jetpack Cat is fun to play as a support, but...

2339
03:35:48,030 --> 03:35:48,850
That's right.

2340
03:35:48,890 --> 03:35:50,270
I haven't.

2341
03:35:50,270 --> 03:35:51,330
I have an SSD.

2342
03:35:52,230 --> 03:35:53,550
I got in first.

2343
03:35:57,420 --> 03:35:58,960
I still, I personally am not.

2344
03:35:59,200 --> 03:36:03,680
I think the only character I don't think it's fun to play is
Mizuki.

2345
03:36:04,200 --> 03:36:06,160
Mizuki is like meh for me.

2346
03:36:08,980 --> 03:36:10,420
Mizuki is meh.

2347
03:36:17,410 --> 03:36:19,510
I think it sucks though.

2348
03:36:19,790 --> 03:36:26,910
I feel like the port has a really nice mobility, has really
nice mobility, but Mizuki does not.

2349
03:36:27,090 --> 03:36:30,030
Like, I feel like if anything, Mizuki would need a wall
clap.

2350
03:36:32,970 --> 03:36:37,430
Mizuki doesn't have, like, uh, like, does it have, like, the
best mobility.

2351
03:36:39,190 --> 03:36:40,090
Yeah, I played Domina.

2352
03:36:40,670 --> 03:36:45,270
I played Domina, and then I got counter-picked, and then I
was, and then I played Maga for the first time.

2353
03:36:47,570 --> 03:36:50,270
But I don't think, I don't find it like that fun.

2354
03:36:50,390 --> 03:36:50,710
Oh.

2355
03:36:53,090 --> 03:36:54,310
Wait, is Lifeline?

2356
03:36:54,410 --> 03:36:56,290
Does Lifeline heal as well?

2357
03:36:56,970 --> 03:36:58,450
Well, I don't want it.

2358
03:36:59,890 --> 03:37:00,150
Yeah.

2359
03:37:02,390 --> 03:37:03,450
Wait, I don't want it.

2360
03:37:03,470 --> 03:37:04,270
I don't want it no more.

2361
03:37:04,570 --> 03:37:05,770
I don't want it no more.

2362
03:37:06,530 --> 03:37:06,750
There

2363
03:37:16,370 --> 03:37:18,650

2364
03:37:19,790 --> 03:37:20,150

2365
03:37:20,450 --> 03:37:20,930

Grab the cat!

2368
03:37:45,140 --> 03:37:46,400
What the fuck?

2369
03:37:46,540 --> 03:37:48,200
It's Call of Duty and Halo?

2370
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:50,120
What is this?

2371
03:38:03,740 --> 03:38:05,040
There we go.

2372
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:07,080
I don't remember which one I liked.

2373
03:38:08,100 --> 03:38:09,240
I think it was this, right?

2374
03:38:11,940 --> 03:38:13,260
What the fuck?

2375
03:38:13,440 --> 03:38:14,220

03:38:15,940 --> 03:38:18,520
Why would you play Farah against me?

2377
03:38:25,480 --> 03:38:27,040

That's insane.

2436
03:44:03,580 --> 03:44:05,660
He has doubled everyone.

2437
03:44:06,040 --> 03:44:06,660
That's actually...

2438
03:44:06,680 --> 03:44:07,900
Okay, now it's time.

2439
03:44:08,320 --> 03:44:08,800

2440
03:44:08,940 --> 03:44:09,820
It's time.

2441
03:44:10,520 --> 03:44:11,820
Get packed, cat.

2442
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:16,920
Holy shit.

2443
03:44:17,220 --> 03:44:18,220
My fucking back.

2444
03:44:18,720 --> 03:44:19,640
My back.

2445
03:44:19,920 --> 03:44:21,340
I gotta see.

2446
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:23,200
Well, don't see a chiropractor.

2447
03:44:23,480 --> 03:44:23,920
There's scams.

2448
03:44:24,180 --> 03:44:24,380
I'm sorry.

2449
03:44:24,400 --> 03:44:25,600
I'm sorry if you're a chiropractor.

2450
03:44:26,080 --> 03:44:27,960
If your occupation is a chiropractor.

2451
03:44:28,320 --> 03:44:31,860
But I personally see chiropracting as a scam.

2452
03:44:32,100 --> 03:44:34,200
Because like too many horror stories.

2453
03:44:34,800 --> 03:44:36,240
Too many horror stories.

2454
03:44:36,680 --> 03:44:47,480
it yeah apparently it's not it is not even a long-term fix
like it could actually fuck up your body forever if you do

2455
03:44:47,480 --> 03:44:58,380
it if like one wrong stretch uh what one wrong stretch can
make you paralyzed and that's a fucking fear that's that's a

2456
03:44:58,380 --> 03:45:02,260
fear how

2457
03:45:06,890 --> 03:45:08,450
it moves like don't worry

2458
03:45:13,350 --> 03:45:20,210
it cannot guarantee that'll fix your back and can
potentially cause you to be paralyzed so like i don't i

2459
03:45:20,210 --> 03:45:27,470
don't fuck with that new phobia unlock you see if you never
get if you never go to a chiropractor you'll never have to

2460
03:45:27,470 --> 03:45:38,490
experience it yeah short-term fix long-term damage
apparently i feel like a lot of characters a lot of the new

2461
03:45:38,490 --> 03:45:39,750
characters seem

2462
03:45:43,770 --> 03:45:47,850
seem really over tuned except for Mizuki.

2463
03:45:50,610 --> 03:45:52,690
Or maybe I just didn't know how to play her.

2464
03:45:52,810 --> 03:45:53,830
I just didn't know how to play it.

2465
03:45:54,030 --> 03:46:00,530
But for now, it seems like everybody is like super strong.

2466
03:46:00,810 --> 03:46:06,910
And then there's Mizuki who's like, who seems to be the most
balanced character out of all four of all five of them.

2467
03:46:08,470 --> 03:46:10,970
Mizuki seems to be the most balanced one out of five of
them.

2468
03:46:11,210 --> 03:46:13,170
Everyone else seems super over tuned.

2469
03:46:16,010 --> 03:46:24,050
in quick play in quick play i feel like a really good player
who plays mizuki will absolutely destroy people but like in

2470
03:46:24,050 --> 03:46:31,470
quick play since everybody is like learning right now he
feels the most balanced until until like people figured him

2471
03:46:31,470 --> 03:46:47,540

03:46:59,540 --> 03:47:01,540
I don't know what team I'm in, though.

2475
03:47:01,580 --> 03:47:02,200
Let me check.

2476
03:47:03,220 --> 03:47:03,860
I don't know.

2477
03:47:03,960 --> 03:47:05,960

Gale.

He's just gonna play Hawkeye.

2501
03:48:59,910 --> 03:49:01,690
I don't want to play against Moxie.

2502
03:49:01,790 --> 03:49:03,110
I hate playing against Hawkeye.

2503
03:49:14,770 --> 03:49:15,730
We can't...

2504
03:49:15,730 --> 03:49:18,010
We can't ban Hawkeye.

2505
03:49:19,230 --> 03:49:20,610
It's no bad.

2506
03:49:21,090 --> 03:49:22,350

03:49:28,160 --> 03:49:33,220

03:50:45,490 --> 03:50:46,610
Go, well, I got you!

2518
03:50:47,390 --> 03:50:49,350
Okay, not like that, though.

2519
03:50:49,470 --> 03:50:51,150
I heal the best I could.

2520
03:50:55,550 --> 03:50:56,450
I'm healing.

2521
03:51:00,710 --> 03:51:01,690

03:51:14,200 --> 03:51:14,560
I'm healing.

2526
03:51:19,020 --> 03:51:19,580
Boom!

2527
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:21,140
Oh, my God.

2528
03:51:21,220 --> 03:51:22,340
I think I actually killed somebody.

2529
03:51:25,980 --> 03:51:26,860
Oh, shit.

2530
03:51:27,000 --> 03:51:27,260

03:51:27,840 --> 03:51:28,860
Where's my tank?

2532
03:51:29,020 --> 03:51:29,740
Oh, shit.

2533
03:51:29,960 --> 03:51:30,480
I'm sorry.

2534
03:51:31,540 --> 03:51:32,440
I'm trying.

2535
03:51:37,770 --> 03:51:39,330
I'm trying to hit.

2536
03:51:39,390 --> 03:51:39,770
Boom!

2537
03:51:40,310 --> 03:51:41,050
Get out of here.

2538
03:51:41,550 --> 03:51:42,730
Okay, I can't do it.

2539
03:51:42,770 --> 03:51:44,010
I can't help you with that.

2540
03:51:44,550 --> 03:51:45,010
Don't worry.

2541
03:51:45,690 --> 03:51:47,310
Does anyone want to be gripped?

2542
03:51:52,080 --> 03:51:53,080
That's our get her!

2543
03:51:54,440 --> 03:51:55,000
Get her!

2544
03:51:59,700 --> 03:52:00,740
Holy shit.

2545
03:52:02,420 --> 03:52:03,480
Oh my god.

2546
03:52:03,620 --> 03:52:04,540
Okay, give me a sec.

2547
03:52:06,340 --> 03:52:09,520
Wait, where do I even fucking take these guys?

2548
03:52:10,820 --> 03:52:12,400
Oh, we lost it.

2549
03:52:12,840 --> 03:52:14,500
This is a terrible map for...

2550
03:52:14,500 --> 03:52:15,160
That's it!

2551
03:52:15,520 --> 03:52:15,960
Boom!

2552
03:52:16,200 --> 03:52:16,900
Get over here!

2553
03:52:17,480 --> 03:52:18,840
Get over here, Lucio!

2554
03:52:22,080 --> 03:52:23,540
Get out of here!

2555
03:52:24,400 --> 03:52:25,740
Okay, I'm leaving.

2556
03:52:32,760 --> 03:52:34,100
Alright, where am I going?

2557
03:52:36,160 --> 03:52:36,840
Okay.

2558
03:52:36,880 --> 03:52:37,620
Do this.

2559
03:52:45,610 --> 03:52:46,390
I got you.

2560
03:52:48,790 --> 03:52:50,450
Oh my god, worth it!

2561
03:52:50,830 --> 03:52:51,390
Worth it!

2562
03:52:51,650 --> 03:52:52,210
Worth it!

2563
03:52:52,350 --> 03:52:53,270
So worth it!

2564
03:52:55,970 --> 03:52:57,130
My entire team's dead.

2565
03:52:57,750 --> 03:52:58,850
My entire team died.

2566
03:52:59,690 --> 03:53:01,250
But like, it was worth it.

2567
03:53:02,070 --> 03:53:02,110
Honestly.

2568
03:53:03,970 --> 03:53:06,250
My entire team died, but it was worth it.

2569
03:53:06,330 --> 03:53:08,290
I literally soloed that fucking idiot.

2570
03:53:19,090 --> 03:53:19,890
Oh my god.

2571
03:53:19,990 --> 03:53:20,690
He's so low.

2572
03:53:25,140 --> 03:53:25,680
Let me go.

2573
03:53:36,020 --> 03:53:36,960
Let me go.

2574
03:53:38,320 --> 03:53:40,400
Does anyone want to be picked up?

2575
03:53:40,860 --> 03:53:41,000
Anyone?

2576
03:53:41,080 --> 03:53:41,280
No?

2577
03:53:41,380 --> 03:53:42,100
Okay, that's cool.

2578
03:53:42,220 --> 03:53:44,060
I don't know how to do it correctly anyway.

2579
03:53:44,480 --> 03:53:46,100
To be fair, I am not doing that.

2580
03:53:46,860 --> 03:53:47,080
Oh.

2581
03:53:55,370 --> 03:53:56,110
That's okay.

2582
03:53:59,030 --> 03:53:59,830
That's okay.

2583
03:53:59,890 --> 03:54:00,430
I got you.

2584
03:54:00,590 --> 03:54:01,110
I got you.

2585
03:54:01,470 --> 03:54:01,950
Boom!

2586
03:54:02,450 --> 03:54:04,330
I used my melee to heal.

2587
03:54:05,090 --> 03:54:06,330
Oh my god.

2588
03:54:09,090 --> 03:54:11,110
Okay, it's okay.

2589
03:54:16,930 --> 03:54:18,330
Get away!

2590
03:54:22,180 --> 03:54:22,720
No!

2591
03:54:26,740 --> 03:54:28,080
I did that.

2592
03:54:30,060 --> 03:54:31,040
Oh, no!

2593
03:54:31,700 --> 03:54:35,520
He freaking took me down.

2594
03:54:39,430 --> 03:54:40,650
That's okay.

2595
03:54:49,990 --> 03:54:51,030
Oh, I got you guys.

2596
03:54:52,730 --> 03:54:53,930
I got you.

2597
03:54:53,950 --> 03:54:54,410
you guys.

2598
03:54:54,530 --> 03:54:56,470
I need you guys to get in, though.

2599
03:55:01,610 --> 03:55:03,190
Oh my god, not me.

2600
03:55:03,830 --> 03:55:04,850
No, not me.

2601
03:55:07,090 --> 03:55:08,750
Oh, this is not good for us.

2602
03:55:12,980 --> 03:55:13,780
Oh my god.

2603
03:55:13,900 --> 03:55:14,540
Okay, it's fine.

2604
03:55:21,040 --> 03:55:21,800
I'm trying.

2605
03:55:23,160 --> 03:55:23,880
Oh my god.

2606
03:55:25,400 --> 03:55:25,880
No!

2607
03:55:27,020 --> 03:55:29,300
I survived for so long.

2608
03:55:32,680 --> 03:55:33,200
Lost.

2609
03:55:35,440 --> 03:55:37,620
Look, I think...

2610
03:55:37,620 --> 03:55:39,700
I think...

2611
03:55:39,700 --> 03:55:40,780
DPS diff.

2612
03:55:42,660 --> 03:55:44,700
Just a DPS diff, you know?

2613
03:55:45,560 --> 03:55:46,640
I am healing.

2614
03:55:47,140 --> 03:55:48,500
Okay, maybe not as much.

2615
03:55:48,820 --> 03:55:49,640
It's not fair!

2616
03:55:49,780 --> 03:55:51,080
They ran Lucio!

2617
03:55:53,140 --> 03:55:54,920
It's not fair!

2618
03:55:55,280 --> 03:55:56,680
They're running Lucio.

2619
03:55:56,980 --> 03:55:58,980
They're not trying new characters.

2620
03:55:59,760 --> 03:56:00,380
Jesus.

2621
03:56:01,940 --> 03:56:02,680
Get...

2622
03:56:02,680 --> 03:56:03,040

03:56:04,240 --> 03:56:05,720
Get C9!

2624
03:56:11,290 --> 03:56:12,910
That's fucking right.

2625
03:56:21,120 --> 03:56:22,420

2626
03:56:23,180 --> 03:56:23,900

Oh my god, get Ajax!

2629
03:56:29,100 --> 03:56:31,020
Clearly God is up cancelled.

2630
03:56:31,540 --> 03:56:33,480
I had a feeling he was gonna do that.

2631
03:56:35,760 --> 03:56:37,700
That's called Game Sense.

2632
03:56:39,360 --> 03:56:41,100
Guys, he got Game Sense.

2633
03:56:42,880 --> 03:56:52,720

I don't know how to grip my teammates still.

2636
03:57:30,070 --> 03:57:31,350
I don't know how to do it.

2637
03:57:31,430 --> 03:57:35,250
I don't know how to do it in, like, an actual, helpful way.

2638
03:57:40,790 --> 03:57:42,310
That cat's a killer.

2639
03:57:43,970 --> 03:57:44,830
Oh, my God.

2640
03:57:50,570 --> 03:57:50,870

2641
03:58:00,940 --> 03:58:01,980
Oh, shit.

2642
03:58:02,220 --> 03:58:02,660
I'm leaving.

2643
03:58:06,810 --> 03:58:07,430
Oh, shit.

2644
03:58:07,630 --> 03:58:08,330

2650
03:58:41,490 --> 03:58:43,870

2651
03:58:44,230 --> 03:58:45,110
Oh my god, that's it!

2652
03:58:49,330 --> 03:58:50,210
There we go.

2653
03:58:51,050 --> 03:58:51,870
They have no tank!

2654
03:58:55,500 --> 03:58:56,520
They have no tank!

2655
03:58:59,000 --> 03:58:59,900
They threw!

2656
03:59:04,610 --> 03:59:05,570
They actually threw.

2657
03:59:11,240 --> 03:59:12,740
Oh my god, he's shooting up.

2658
03:59:13,460 --> 03:59:15,640
He's actually go shooting Hager.

2659
03:59:19,360 --> 03:59:22,080
Okay, our on-run is crazy, though.

2660
03:59:22,480 --> 03:59:24,440
Like, why would you do that?

2661
03:59:26,440 --> 03:59:29,920
Oh my god, our DPS is special!

2662
03:59:36,490 --> 03:59:38,550
Oh my god, my tank is dead.

2663
03:59:40,250 --> 03:59:41,510
Don't worry, I'll kidnap later.

2664
03:59:42,150 --> 03:59:43,270
I'll kidnap later.

2665
03:59:46,450 --> 03:59:48,070
Why would she do that?

2666
03:59:48,090 --> 03:59:50,450
She was, like, so low.

2667
03:59:52,250 --> 03:59:55,490
So, well, we have another on-rush.

2668
03:59:58,650 --> 04:00:00,430
That's weird that they're starting to look up.

2669
04:00:00,550 --> 04:00:01,410
I don't like it.

2670
04:00:04,750 --> 04:00:07,110
I don't like that he's looking up, guys.

2671
04:00:12,680 --> 04:00:13,940
Get over here.

2672
04:00:15,140 --> 04:00:15,700

Oh, my God.

2675
04:00:21,980 --> 04:00:23,020
Worth it.

2676
04:00:25,140 --> 04:00:25,960
Worth it.

2677
04:00:29,950 --> 04:00:30,890
Oh my god.

2678
04:00:31,230 --> 04:00:34,030
I'm so good at DPS still on the cat.

2679
04:00:37,790 --> 04:00:38,310
Okay.

2680
04:00:44,910 --> 04:00:45,790
I'll pre-heal him.

2681
04:00:46,130 --> 04:00:46,890
What the fuck?

2682
04:00:52,050 --> 04:00:53,250
I don't know.

2683
04:00:53,450 --> 04:00:54,570
That's a little...

2684
04:00:58,340 --> 04:00:59,180
I don't know.

2685
04:00:59,420 --> 04:01:00,520
What the fuck already?

2686
04:01:01,100 --> 04:01:03,260
I did not expect him to have it already.

2687
04:01:07,500 --> 04:01:19,700
Oh my god, that's right Get clawed Get clawed Oh, I built

04:01:33,140 --> 04:01:34,280
How did he kill him?

2690
04:01:36,940 --> 04:01:39,860
The cloud feels strong overall.

2691
04:01:42,120 --> 04:01:42,640
IMO.

2692
04:01:56,030 --> 04:01:57,530

He faded out.

2700
04:02:49,670 --> 04:02:49,670
God.

2701
04:02:50,630 --> 04:02:52,350
I didn't expect it.

2702
04:03:04,170 --> 04:03:05,330
Oh my God, it's worth it.

2703
04:03:06,330 --> 04:03:07,170
Oh my God.

2704
04:03:07,350 --> 04:03:08,310

04:05:37,890 --> 04:05:43,010
The fact that I was able to cancel the Lucio, the Lucio alt
was crazy.

It doesn't exist.

2747
04:06:53,900 --> 04:06:55,880
It's like I never play it.

2748
04:06:55,920 --> 04:06:57,480
Does it truly exist?

2749
04:06:58,420 --> 04:07:00,000

The perfect world is shaped by my hand.

2768
04:08:57,810 --> 04:08:59,630
I don't know what the fuck to do with the grip.

2769
04:09:00,250 --> 04:09:01,410
I always wanted to retire.

2770
04:09:01,430 --> 04:09:01,910
Like, I don't know.

2771
04:09:02,130 --> 04:09:09,350
I feel like maybe I think the grip would be fun if you're
coordinating it with like some a friend or something.

2772
04:09:09,570 --> 04:09:12,470
If you're coordinating with a team in rank, like I have grip

04:14:00,190 --> 04:14:01,450
Get in there!

2819
04:14:10,030 --> 04:14:12,170
Oh my god, and I got caged.

2820
04:14:12,670 --> 04:14:14,230
And I got caged too.

2821
04:14:21,170 --> 04:14:22,730
I feel like I have to play.

2822
04:14:24,390 --> 04:14:27,350
Did you guys see they released new heroes today?

2823
04:14:28,610 --> 04:14:33,910
The enemy team only, there's only the...

2824
04:14:33,910 --> 04:14:36,630
Bro, I stare like, guys, did you see that?

2825
04:14:38,910 --> 04:14:47,290

2827
04:15:14,110 --> 04:15:15,630
That's funny, though.

2828
04:15:24,750 --> 04:15:24,950
Oh, no.

2829
04:15:25,030 --> 04:15:26,930
Our honor is dead as fuck.

2830
04:15:35,230 --> 04:15:35,790
Oh, my God.

2831
04:15:35,850 --> 04:15:36,150
That's fine.

2832
04:15:36,250 --> 04:15:36,730
I killed him.

2833
04:15:39,310 --> 04:15:39,890
That's fine.

2834
04:15:41,230 --> 04:15:42,390
I got him.

2835
04:15:46,810 --> 04:15:47,510
Who is...

2836
04:15:47,510 --> 04:15:48,790
Who are you getting shot at by?

2837
04:15:49,350 --> 04:15:50,310
I can't tell.

2838
04:15:53,890 --> 04:15:55,050
I hear somber.

2839
04:15:56,130 --> 04:15:56,530
Yeah.

2840
04:15:57,330 --> 04:15:57,810
Oh,

2841
04:16:01,070 --> 04:16:02,270
I can't help them there.

2842
04:16:03,530 --> 04:16:04,290
I mean, I can.

2843
04:16:08,880 --> 04:16:09,580
Oh, my God.

2844
04:16:09,800 --> 04:16:10,080
I can't push.

2845
04:16:10,440 --> 04:16:11,060
I can't push.

2846
04:16:13,440 --> 04:16:13,960
Oh, my God.

2847
04:16:14,140 --> 04:16:14,440
It's fine.

2848
04:16:17,160 --> 04:16:17,920
It's fine.

2849
04:16:25,630 --> 04:16:26,330
There we are.

2850
04:16:26,570 --> 04:16:27,070
Worth it.

2851
04:16:30,550 --> 04:16:31,030
Push.

2852
04:16:32,190 --> 04:16:33,490
I mean, it's good counter.

2853
04:16:33,510 --> 04:16:35,050
I will say.

2854
04:16:35,690 --> 04:16:37,790
I'm counter-diving the Winston.

2855
04:16:38,030 --> 04:16:40,850
When I'm there, I have to play with my team, though.

2856
04:16:45,730 --> 04:16:46,270
Push!

2857
04:16:49,250 --> 04:16:49,790
Oh, shit.

2858
04:16:49,930 --> 04:16:50,470
I fell down.

2859
04:16:50,790 --> 04:16:51,330
I'm sorry.

2860
04:16:53,810 --> 04:16:55,830
Like, where do I put the shield for?

2861
04:16:56,850 --> 04:16:59,690
Like, here, I'm gonna...

2862
04:16:59,690 --> 04:17:00,670
Get out of here!

2863
04:17:04,600 --> 04:17:05,740
Oh, my God.

2864
04:17:05,900 --> 04:17:06,140
Whoa.

2865
04:17:06,700 --> 04:17:07,680
I mean, okay.

2866
04:17:17,380 --> 04:17:22,220
Oh What the fuck

2867
04:17:27,680 --> 04:17:29,940
I'll fucking kill this guy

2868
04:17:39,080 --> 04:17:41,860
What oh my god here he is

2869
04:17:47,090 --> 04:17:50,510
There we go I was like what is going on?

2870
04:17:50,790 --> 04:18:05,850
I'm so There we go It's like Yeah most damage Look at that.

2871
04:18:06,470 --> 04:18:09,790
My entire team are playing new characters.

2872
04:18:10,330 --> 04:18:13,310
And the enemy team went and tried to play meta.

2873
04:18:14,050 --> 04:18:15,570
Or play their best character.

2874
04:18:19,190 --> 04:18:20,010
Holy shit.

2875
04:18:22,530 --> 04:18:23,530
Look at John Halo.

2876
04:18:23,830 --> 04:18:26,010
Girl, this has to be the easiest character in the game.

2877
04:18:26,230 --> 04:18:26,770
I'm sorry.

2878
04:18:28,030 --> 04:18:29,150
John Halo.

2879
04:18:30,290 --> 04:18:32,150
It has to be the easiest character.

2880
04:18:32,170 --> 04:18:32,670
character.

2881
04:18:35,350 --> 04:18:36,490
I say Domina.

2882
04:18:36,730 --> 04:18:37,690
She does her job.

2883
04:18:37,890 --> 04:18:38,770
She does her job.

2884
04:18:38,930 --> 04:18:40,650
She is also, she seems balanced.

2885
04:18:41,010 --> 04:18:42,230
She seems really balanced.

2886
04:18:42,750 --> 04:18:43,250
I don't know.

2887
04:18:43,470 --> 04:18:45,170
Her alt is like pretty ass.

2888
04:18:45,830 --> 04:18:49,670
I think it's stronger when everyone's bunched up.

2889
04:18:49,830 --> 04:18:50,670
I was playing against a dive.

2890
04:18:50,750 --> 04:18:56,270
For some reason, I was playing against a dive team and then
I don't know what to do against it.

2891
04:18:57,590 --> 04:18:58,810
I think we're playing bra.

2892
04:18:59,170 --> 04:18:59,630
Yeah.

2893
04:19:00,470 --> 04:19:07,450
I think playing if i'm playing against bra then like her all
it would be super strong but like she's really good at

2894
04:19:07,450 --> 04:19:11,230
anti-dive i liked it i literally canceled the anti-dive with
my push

2895
04:19:14,900 --> 04:19:24,720
but i think she's strong against anti i think she's strong
against dive and um she does she's boring i will say i think

2896
04:19:24,720 --> 04:19:34,660
i find her boring to play i think she's not fun to play like
she's just like shield shield push when enemy comes in, E,

2897
04:19:34,860 --> 04:19:42,800
and when they're closer, but like, I personally think, like,
I don't know, I think she's like, she's pretty boring to

2898
04:19:42,800 --> 04:19:43,000
play.

2899
04:19:43,100 --> 04:19:48,820
I don't think she's not, she doesn't seem like fun in terms
of, like, she does get the job done, but I'm not having,

2900
04:19:48,960 --> 04:19:51,580
like, the most fun playing here compared to the other
characters.

2901
04:19:51,920 --> 04:19:58,220
I had fun playing Aaron, I had fun playing Emra, I had fun
playing Jetpack Cat, I was very lost playing Mizuki, but I

2902
04:19:58,220 --> 04:20:00,300
can see that he can't be strong in the right hands.

2903
04:20:01,020 --> 04:20:02,940
He seems really balanced with he's good.

2904
04:20:03,460 --> 04:20:09,940
I think a really good, like, flex support player can play
Mizuki really, really well because he's, I think his damage

2905
04:20:09,940 --> 04:20:13,220
seems pretty good in general, especially if you're really
good at damage.

2906
04:20:13,600 --> 04:20:17,260
You're really good at damage and you can build up your heals
from it.

2907
04:20:18,400 --> 04:20:21,740
But yeah, it was really fun getting back to Overwatch,
honestly.

2908
04:20:22,200 --> 04:20:24,760
I had a really great time revisiting Overwatch.

2909
04:20:25,480 --> 04:20:32,920
With all the five new heroes, Jetpack has so fucking fun i
wish we could watch the replay guys i but like unfortunately

2910
04:20:32,920 --> 04:20:40,100
for some reason the replay replays are dead right now but i
want to say most fun character 100 jetpack cat like

2911
04:20:40,100 --> 04:20:45,360
especially the last game i played with him where i was just
fucking running around like scratching people and and like

2912
04:20:45,360 --> 04:20:57,860
abducting them and having my own one v one like i kidnapped
him and be like one v one me no items final destination uh

2913
04:20:57,860 --> 04:21:04,000
cat only I literally abducted the Lucille like four times.

2914
04:21:06,080 --> 04:21:08,120
He had a health pack, too.

2915
04:21:08,440 --> 04:21:11,340
He literally used the health pack and still lost.

2916
04:21:13,560 --> 04:21:17,100
Anyway, that is my personal opinion on Overwatch.

2917
04:21:17,540 --> 04:21:18,680
Tomorrow is Rivals.

2918
04:21:19,020 --> 04:21:19,960
It'll be on Twitch tomorrow.

2919
04:21:19,980 --> 04:21:23,700
I'll post the schedule later today for those who want to
know the schedule.

2920
04:21:24,260 --> 04:21:25,420
Thank y'all for coming.

2921
04:21:25,600 --> 04:21:28,820
It was very early stream, but I feel like we had a lot of
fun.

2922
04:21:29,220 --> 04:21:31,660
definitely enjoyed all the new characters that they
implemented.

2923
04:21:32,920 --> 04:21:34,800
As, oh, I hope you guys enjoyed watching, too.

2924
04:21:34,900 --> 04:21:42,280

2925
04:21:42,280 --> 04:21:42,720

like, in their own fucking Hunger Games or some shit.

2930
04:21:53,520 --> 04:21:55,280

2938
04:22:49,560 --> 04:23:03,400
like a year plus ago um but um but like it's honestly um lot

2939
04:23:03,400 --> 04:23:09,680
fucking updates now and what else do i want to say um
there's something else i wanted to say too fuck it already

2940
04:23:09,680 --> 04:23:20,780
already left my head um oh yeah i felt really bad for 2x ko
because i heard they like like cut half their staff like

2941
04:23:20,780 --> 04:23:27,200
yesterday or two days ago because they didn't get the
reception they anticipated for a riot game apparently i

2942
04:23:27,200 --> 04:23:33,260
don't know if you guys heard they cut like half their staff
for it so um so i thought it was like really unfortunate

2943
04:23:33,260 --> 04:23:38,920
because it seemed like a lot of love was put into that game
but they just um right now everyone's just playing mobas

2944
04:23:38,920 --> 04:23:47,460
again i think like everyone's now just playing i think a new
meta is literally a moba meta at the moment

2945
04:23:50,480 --> 04:23:57,300
um anyway as always everybody stay hydrated posture check
Get up and move around to get that blow forward.

2946
04:23:57,380 --> 04:24:00,220
And you say it for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2947
04:24:00,380 --> 04:24:01,620
