1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
And this is the first sentence.

2
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,160
Drink the last cup of coffee.

3
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,460
Hmm...

4
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,280
Huh?

5
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,500
Hey, grab home.

6
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,300
Wake up!

7
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,440
Did you do Mrs. B's homework?

8
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,060
Oh man, I stayed up too late playing Marvel Rivals, so I need a copy of yours real quick.

9
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,280
Hey.

10
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,800
Wait, Dragoon.

11
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Wait, where did...

12
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,580
Where did he go?

13
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
Oh my god.

14
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,640
I need a copy.

15
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,680
I need a copy of his homework.

16
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,060
Is that you over there, Dragoon?

17
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,900
What...

18
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,140
What are you doing underneath that desk, huh?

19
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,600
You don't want me to stuff you in that locker again.

20
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,260
Come on!

21
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,960
Mrs. B is gonna be here any minute now.

22
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,460
Come on, get out of there!

23
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,480
Underneath that desk!

24
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,500
Look.

25
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,220
Look, Dragoon.

26
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,040
I can't get another detention or I'll miss a soccer practice.

27
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,980
And they're gonna cut me from the team.

28
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,380
Okay?

29
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,640
So, come on!

30
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,840
Hand me over...

31
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,160
Hand over the homework so I can copy off of you.

32
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,260
Hello?

33
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,620
Hey!

34
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,380
Are you like some kind of pervert?

35
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,200
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

36
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,720
Are you...

37
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,860
Bro, like...

38
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,300
What?

39
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,320
Are you some kind of pervert or something?

40
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,060
Get out of here!

41
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,340
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

42
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,720
What do you mean you ate the homework?

43
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,600
Come on!

44
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,760
Mrs. B is gonna be here any minute now!

45
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,080
I need you to get out of underneath that desk and help me with this homework.

46
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,980
Hello?

47
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,860
Don't make me bend down there.

48
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,920
Dragoon, come on.

49
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,100
Get out of there.

50
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,120
Get out of there, Dragoon.

51
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,780
Come on.

52
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,940
Come on.

53
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,060
Oh my god.

54
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,420
I can't believe you made me bend down just to see if you were underneath that desk.

55
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,160
What do you mean there was homework?

56
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,220
I know you did that homework, you goddamn nerd.

57
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,180
Come on.

58
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,980
Move.

59
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,600
Move out of that desk.

60
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,380
Come on.

61
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh my god.

62
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,160
Alright, I'm bending down.

63
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:27,940
Hello?

64
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,500
Dragoon?

65
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,900
I'm gonna count to three.

66
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,000
And you're gonna... you're gonna get out of that desk.

67
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,540
Alright?

68
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,300
Dragoon?

69
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,060
I am going to count to three.

70
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,820
One.

71
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,620
Two.

72
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,680
Three.

73
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,120
Oh my god.

74
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,280
Why are you... why are you still looking down?

75
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,640
Why are you... why are you still looking down, Dragoon?

76
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,740
My face is up here.

77
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,800
Come on.

78
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,680
Look, I need you... look.

79
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,300
I know we have like...

80
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,260
like...

81
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,400
pre-calculus or something.

82
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,620
And I almost failed.

83
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,940
I almost failed pre-calculus.

84
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,080
And I know you're the...

85
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,580
you're the best math goon out here.

86
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,000
Out of all of us.

87
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,740
So, I... I don't even remember.

88
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,780
Wait, is the Pytharious theorem part of pre-cal...

89
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,200
Oh my gosh.

90
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,660
What even is in pre-calculus?

91
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,640
Wait...

92
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,240
Look, I can't get cut from my soccer team.

93
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,600
Alright?

94
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm literally...

95
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,400
I'm literally...

96
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,700
their only goalkeeper.

97
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,760
If I get cut...

98
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,460
from the soccer team...

99
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:39,900
like...

100
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,040
that team's through.

101
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,820
Like, who's gonna be goalie now?

102
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,620
You think...

103
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,280
you think...

104
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,520
a goon's gonna be...

105
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
gonna be a good goalie?

106
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,620
He's basically our ball practice.

107
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,660
Uh...

108
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,180
What are you doing?

109
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,180
Oh my god.

110
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,580
What are you doing?

111
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,180
You wanna go back down the desk?

112
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,980
What are you looking at my...

113
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,080
Oh my...

114
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,620
God!

115
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,060
If I didn't need a...

116
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,120
If I didn't need a...

117
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,380
copy your homework...

118
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,020
I'd kick you right now.

119
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,680
I...

120
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,080
Oh my god.

121
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,680
Alright.

122
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,160
Come on.

123
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,900
Look back up.

124
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes.

125
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,360
Look back up.

126
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,200
There you go.

127
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,260
There you go.

128
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:19,680
Yes.

129
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,840
You're almost there.

130
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,720
You're almost there.

131
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,540
I can't believe it.

132
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,500
Oh my god.

133
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,760
If only...

134
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,960
All the other...

135
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,500
I know you're like...

136
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,120
like...

137
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,020
the best...

138
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,560
at pre-cal...

139
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,660
or math class.

140
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,820
Uh...

141
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,300
And like...

142
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,860
every time I copy your homework...

143
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,080
like...

144
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,800
I always get like...

145
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,460
a decent grade.

146
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,860
So I really...

147
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,920
really need you...

148
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,100
to focus up...

149
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,200
right now...

150
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,900
and hand me that piece of paper.

151
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,100
Um...

152
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,420
The bell's gonna ring...

153
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,820
at...

154
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,060
any minute now.

155
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,060
Come on.

156
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,500
You know how much money...

157
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,920
my parents paid me...

158
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,480
to...

159
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
to get me into...

160
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Dragoon Academy?

161
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,700
Yeah.

162
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,240
Yeah.

163
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,340
Because it was...

164
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,900
definitely not for my test scores.

165
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,760
It...

166
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,700
So...

167
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,260
you gotta...

168
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,140
You gotta let me copy that.

169
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,520
I don't wanna...

170
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,460
I don't...

171
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,360
I can't get kicked out of...

172
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,080
Dragoon Academy.

173
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,860
Look, my parents paid a lot of money...

174
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,680
for me to be here.

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,560
And...

176
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,680
I didn't even need to take any...

177
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,360
tests...

178
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,080
to get in.

179
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,660
I literally got in because...

180
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,920
because of...

181
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,220
nepotism...

182
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,880
and money.

183
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,940
So you gotta...

184
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,480
hurry up and cough up those papers...

185
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,180
real quick.

186
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,360
Uh...

187
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,080
Alright.

188
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,240
You're almost there.

189
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,400
You're...

190
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,220
I don't know.

191
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,740
Um...

192
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,200
Excuse me.

193
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,020
Um...

194
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,500
I don't...

195
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,540
Um...

196
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,260
Excuse me.

197
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,220
Um...

198
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,800
I don't like being called a...

199
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,700
nepo baby.

200
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,720
I am a nepo woman.

201
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,920
Oh my...

202
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,720
I don't like you staring at me...

203
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,200
for so long.

204
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,840
Let me...

205
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,700
I don't like this.

206
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,600
Let me put...

207
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,640
put this on real quick.

208
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,100
Alright.

209
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,400
Got my jacket on.

210
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,600
That's right.

211
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
I don't like you staring at...

212
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,920
staring at me this long.

213
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,180
It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.

214
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
I am a nepo adult.

215
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,520
Anyway, it was getting a little cold too.

216
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,960
Um...

217
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,560
So...

218
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,260
I gotta...

219
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,960
gotta put on my hoodie...

220
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,020
slash jacket on.

221
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,820
Um...

222
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,160
Custom made, by the way.

223
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,240
to represent our...

224
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,620
our mascot...

225
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,340
Dragoon...

226
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,680
at the Dragoon Academy.

227
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:46,820
me.

228
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,340
Alright.

229
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,440
Alright.

230
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,600
Alright.

231
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,320
You're almost there.

232
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,720
You're almost there.

233
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,440
You're...

234
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,960
Come on.

235
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,720
I need you to look at my face.

236
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,900
I need you to look up there.

237
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,580
Come on.

238
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,200
Oh my gosh.

239
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,780
That's it.

240
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,120
You're...

241
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,360
I'm gonna tweet about you.

242
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,120
That's it.

243
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,180
You're pissing me off.

244
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,120
I'm gonna tweet about you real quick.

245
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,060
What am I?

246
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,040
Typing right now?

247
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,860
Don't worry about it.

248
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,440
That's right.

249
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
That's right.

250
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,020
If you don't cough up those papers...

251
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm gonna send this tweet out...

252
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,420
right now.

253
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,320
I...

254
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,020
What you gotta do?

255
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,460
Go to the counselor?

256
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,480
Ha!

257
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,000
I won't...

258
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,360
I'll make sure you won't even make it to the counselor.

259
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,900
We're getting...

260
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,760
That's right.

261
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,820
You don't wanna get canceled, do you?

262
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,660
Ha!

263
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,320
Alright.

264
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,220
Okay, you're ready?

265
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,140
You're ready?

266
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,040
Alright.

267
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,160
You're almost there.

268
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,160
Wow.

269
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,300
You're almost...

270
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh.

271
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,340
Oh, hey.

272
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,820
Wait, who's that over there?

273
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,520
Oh.

274
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,780
Oh.

275
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,950
Oh, no.

276
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:26,250
Okay.

277
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,910
Look, it's our...

278
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,290
It's our class president.

279
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,110
Dad.

280
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,150
Dad.

281
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,870
It's our...

282
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,270
It's our class president.

283
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,470
Hello, dad.

284
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,230
What'd you do?

285
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,450
No, don't worry.

286
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:41,970
Don't worry.

287
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,730
I'm not...

288
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,450
Don't worry.

289
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,850
I'm just saying hi to Chonky-goon.

290
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,950
Uh, dad.

291
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,550
I'm...

292
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:47,670
There's...

293
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,970
There's nothing to worry about.

294
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,070
Uh...

295
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,690
There's...

296
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,930
Nothing to worry about.

297
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,510
We're just...

298
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,150
We're just friends.

299
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:54,570
Right?

300
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,810
Chonky-goon?

301
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,230
I'm just being a good friend right now.

302
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,910
And like...

303
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,370
Oh, man.

304
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,070
Like...

305
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,410
Dad, I like...

306
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,610
Forgot my...

307
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,150
I forgot to like...

308
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,670
Uh...

309
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,130
Answer like...

310
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,390
One of my questions...

311
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,990
For Mrs. B's homework.

312
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:08,910
So like...

313
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,050
I was just asking...

314
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,310
Chonky-goon...

315
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,050
If...

316
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,570
Um...

317
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,230
You know...

318
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,210
If he knew the answer to like...

319
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:16,610
Question 5.

320
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,550
That's really it.

321
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,410
Uh...

322
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:18,710
But yeah.

323
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,550
No, no, no, no.

324
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:19,870
We're...

325
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,070
We're just like...

326
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,690
Hang out.

327
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:21,990
You know?

328
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,350
You know?

329
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,710
There's...

330
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,150
The bell's about to ring any minute.

331
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,030
Just wanted to...

332
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,690
Wanted to say hi...

333
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,930
To Chonky-goon.

334
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,830
Want to know...

335
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,550
How his day's been going.

336
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:32,890
And...

337
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,470
Uh...

338
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,470
And like...

339
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,330
You know...

340
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,110
I...

341
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,610
Just wanted to know what he's gonna be doing after school.

342
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,710
Uh...

343
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,610
If he's gonna be alone after school.

344
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,030
You know?

345
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:46,870
I do that.

346
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,030
That's basically it.

347
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:48,630
That...

348
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,770
Yeah.

349
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,630
Don't worry, Mr. Class President.

350
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,330
I'll make sure...

351
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:52,990
I'll...

352
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,690
I'll make sure he'll be safe.

353
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,310
Don't worry.

354
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,370
Keep yourself safe.

355
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,290
Chonky-goon.

356
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,050
Keep...

357
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,770
All right.

358
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,270
All right.

359
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,210
Goodbye, Class...

360
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,290
Mr. Class President.

361
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,290
Goodbye.

362
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,710
Goodbye.

363
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,630
All right.

364
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,290
All right.

365
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:15,750
He's gone.

366
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,250
Class President's gone.

367
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,510
You thought you were gonna...

368
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,490
You thought...

369
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,630
You thought you were gonna...

370
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,370
Get out of that?

371
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,470
You really think...

372
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,470
That's right.

373
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,030
That's right.

374
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,890
You really think...

375
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,470
You could get away...

376
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,370
With not letting me...

377
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,510
Copy your homework.

378
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,630
Come on.

379
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,910
Give me your bag right now.

380
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,790
Ha ha ha.

381
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,710
That's right.

382
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,510
What's that you got there?

383
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,230
Is that your...

384
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,170
Is that your...

385
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,850
Your dessert for lunch?

386
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,930
Give it here.

387
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,430
It's my dessert now.

388
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,830
Ha ha ha.

389
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,310
Ha ha ha.

390
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,490
That's right.

391
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,050
You thought...

392
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,330
You thought that was yours?

393
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,230
It's mine now.

394
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,870
That's what you get...

395
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,150
For not giving me your homework to copy.

396
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,700
That's what you get...

397
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,420
That's what you get...

398
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:43,140
That's what you get...

399
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,000
Wow.

400
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,420
What?

401
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,040
What is it?

402
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,460
Huh?

403
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,100
That's right.

404
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,480
I finished the lollipop too.

405
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,020
So anyway.

406
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,080
So anyway.

407
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,600
It's my birthday today.

408
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,880
Did you get me anything?

409
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,780
Oh, yeah?

410
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,500
Is that your lunch money?

411
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,400
Oh, it's my lunch money now, nerd.

412
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,540
Oh my god, wait.

413
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,400
Look what you did with your lollipop, chongoon.

414
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,600
Look what you did.

415
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,200
There's a stain on my hoodie now.

416
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,880
Oh my gosh, I guess...

417
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,480
I guess I got it.

418
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,600
It's a good thing I always bring a spare.

419
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,800
You're so lucky I have a spare jacket.

420
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,820
Wait until I tell my dad about you.

421
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,700
Yeah, you got here with a scholarship?

422
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,820
Well, say goodbye to that scholarship, chongy-coon.

423
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,840
I'm going to tell my dad about you.

424
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,240
That's right.

425
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,860
And I don't mean dad as in our class president.

426
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,720
I mean my father.

427
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,500
That's right.

428
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,920
Ever wonder why?

429
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,580
Why?

430
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,780
I still haven't been kicked out yet.

431
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,820
That's fucking right.

432
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,160
I'm going to tell my father about you.

433
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,540
Say goodbye to that scholarship.

434
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,720
You want to know who donates the most money to Dragoon Academy?

435
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,240
I mean that's fucking right.

436
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,720
Yeah, that's right.

437
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,060
Now give me your lunch money.

438
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,760
Happy birthday to me.

439
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,460
Happy birthday to me.

440
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,960
Happy birthday to me.

441
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,300
Happy birthday dear dokey bird.

442
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,960
Happy birthday to me.

443
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,840
Yeah!

444
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,140
Come on, chongy-coon.

445
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,060
Sing with me.

446
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,960
Yes, it's my birthday.

447
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,060
Yippee!

448
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,660
Let me put my...

449
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,620
Hold you down.

450
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,640
Hello, everybody.

451
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Alright, roleplay over.

452
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,600
I didn't know how to transition out of it.

453
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,560
I didn't know how to transition out of it.

454
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,780
I don't know.

455
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,940
This is as far as I planned.

456
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,580
My...

457
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,340
The immersion ends here.

458
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,470
The...

459
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,340
The immersion...

460
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,040
End...

461
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,340
Scene.

462
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,160
The immersion ends here, guys.

463
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,900
Hello!

464
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,500
Welcome, everybody.

465
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,760
Welcome, welcome.

466
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,000
To my birthday outfit reveal.

467
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:31,960
This...

468
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,260
The beach episode has finally ended.

469
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,900
We are done with the filler arc.

470
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,620
And now we are...

471
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,100
Now we are here.

472
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,820
In my school arc.

473
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,440
Uh...

474
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,080
Yes!

475
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,360
Do you like my new outfit?

476
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,860
I know it's only been...

477
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,920
Two weeks.

478
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,860
I can't believe you guys ruined my poll.

479
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,760
I had...

480
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,000
So I had like...

481
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,160
All the questions planned out for a poll.

482
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,640
But after you guys ruined the first poll...

483
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,200
I just...

484
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,700
I pulled a plug on it.

485
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,280
I was like...

486
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,620
No more polls for you guys.

487
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,120
No.

488
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,500
That's right.

489
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,100
Do you guys like...

490
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,820
Do you guys like my new outfit, guys?

491
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,800
My...

492
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,040
Um...

493
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,220
My...

494
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,680
Um...

495
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,600
Schoolgirl outfit.

496
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,380
Wait, let me...

497
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:29,860
From...

498
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,180
For the Dragoon Academy.

499
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,520
Let me zoom up for you guys to see.

500
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
I know it was like a super fast...

501
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,040
It was super fast reveal because...

502
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,940
We actually have...

503
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,560
A lot of stuff planned for today.

504
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,800
Um...

505
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,760
So that's why I...

506
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,940
I did zoom in a lot.

507
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,720
But like...

508
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,120
There really wasn't like...

509
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,220
That much to show.

510
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,220
Other than like...

511
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,060
The jacket part.

512
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,800
And...

513
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,260
Um...

514
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,820
The hair.

515
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,900
So...

516
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,860
So...

517
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,460
So...

518
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,240
I did...

519
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,460
I did like...

520
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,660
Zoom in a lot there.

521
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,400
But...

522
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,880
Um...

523
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,720
I do have a lot...

524
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,700
A lot of stuff to show you guys.

525
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,380
For today.

526
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,280
Uh...

527
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,960
For my birthday.

528
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,820
Thank you everybody for coming to my birthday.

529
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,180
Yeah, I did...

530
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,800
Plan...

531
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,260
Part.

532
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,400
I didn't know how to end it.

533
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:09,820
Like...

534
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,800
I know I could have done a whole actual scenario.

535
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,180
Where I stuffed you in a locker.

536
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,000
But like...

537
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,400
We don't have a lot of time.

538
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,900
Because I have a lot of stuff to show you guys.

539
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,440
Like...

540
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,400
There's...

541
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,820
There's a lot of stuff.

542
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,220
So that's why I was like...

543
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,460
Okay.

544
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,480
Scene's over.

545
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,660
Roleplay over.

546
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,680
Um...

547
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:37,580
Um...

548
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,340
But yes...

549
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,080
Okay, so...

550
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,100
If you guys didn't know...

551
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,160
This is the...

552
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,100
I can take it off.

553
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,560
Obviously.

554
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,540
Um...

555
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,340
We are in...

556
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,120
If you guys didn't know...

557
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,700
We are in...

558
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700

559
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,120

So like...

563
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,400
You gotta be very, very smart...

564
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,560
To be able to...

565
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,940
Get into...

00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,940

567
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,200
And...

568
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,780
And...

569
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,960

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,320
My little charms.

581
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,120
And everything.

582
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,080
And then...

583
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,580
Uh...

584
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:15,940
I have...

585
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,620
Of course I have a...

586
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,000
I have a plush...

587
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,200
A keychain of...

588
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,580
You know...

589
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,620
Of our mascot.

590
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,000
Our Dragoon mascot.

591
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,460
In Dragoon Academy.

592
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,740
So you either have to be like...

593
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
A Nepo baby.

594
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,780
Or like...

595
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,620
Get a scholarship.

596
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,080
Or be really, really smart.

597
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,640
To be...

598
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,760
Get into Dragoon Academy.

599
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,360
And here's my shoes.

600
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,040
And everything.

601
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,300
Uh...

602
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,500
So...

603
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Um...

604
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,960
The one thing I...

605
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,980
Def...

606
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,300
I requested...

607
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,040
Was...

608
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,020
As you guys can see...

609
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,840
Is like...

610
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,720
My phone here.

611
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,560
Anytime...

612
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,120
I click anything...

613
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm tweeting out...

614
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm...

615
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,580
I'm...

616
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,280
Um...

617
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,360
I'm tweeting something out.

618
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,140
So...

619
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,080
I'm...

620
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,660
I'm making a Google Doc...

621
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,760
I'm making a Google Doc...

622
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,400
Right now...

623
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,420
To cancel you.

624
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,800
That's what I'm doing.

625
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,200
That's right.

626
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,980
He tried to...

627
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,020
Try to fuck with me.

628
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,020
I'm making a Google Doc right now.

629
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,200
Uh...

630
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,080
That's goddamn right.

631
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,240
So every time I click...

632
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:21,960
Um...

633
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,640
Um...

634
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,380
It does like...

635
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,880
And that...

636
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,000
It does a thing where it seems like I'm tweeting right now.

637
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,740
Which I am.

638
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,080
Uh...

639
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,460
Yes, it's my birthday.

640
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,840
Happy birthday to me.

641
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,500
Thank you, everybody.

642
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,860
For coming here to celebrate my birthday.

643
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,280
It really does mean a lot.

644
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,860
So...

645
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,720
I think like...

646
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,300
It was so hard to pick between...

647
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,020
Um...

648
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,940
Which one I wanted.

649
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,600
So...

650
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,460
I thought they were both really cute.

651
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,560
I have...

652
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:45,960
You know...

653
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
I have the...

654
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,540
Dragon hoodie right here.

655
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,840
And then...

656
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,380
Um...

657
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,600
I have the tomato hoodie as well.

658
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,800
I think the red really goes really well.

659
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,760
So it was very hard to pick between the two.

660
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,940
I was actually...

661
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,120
Okay.

662
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,700
Funny story.

663
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:58,940
Okay.

664
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,280
A lot of things went wrong.

665
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,820
Okay.

666
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

667
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

668
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,720
Okay.

669
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,080
Um...

670
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,700
Actually...

671
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,580
A lot of things actually sort of like went wrong.

672
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,520
Uh...

673
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,640
For this birthday outfit reveal.

674
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,780
Because...

675
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,160
Um...

676
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,980
I was actually supposed to have a...

677
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,020
Um...

678
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,140
Uh...

679
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,240
A second...

680
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,820
Uh...

681
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,580
Hairstyle.

682
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,740
And then...

683
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,880
We found out today...

684
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,860
This morning...

685
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,260
That...

686
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,380
My mama...

687
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,940
Forgot to send me...

688
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,020
The second hairstyle.

689
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,860
And I didn't realize it.

690
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,700
And then...

691
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,140
So yeah...

692
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,940
My papa...

693
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,660
Didn't realize there was a second hairstyle.

694
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,740
So...

695
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,020
That's why we don't...

696
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

697
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,660
But I still...

698
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,780
I still like this one though.

699
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,700
I do like this hairstyle as well.

700
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,420
I look like very...

701
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,680
I look like delinquent.

702
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

703
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:48,780
Wait.

704
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,460
With the...

705
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,440
With the...

706
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,780
Uh...

707
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:50,920
Wait.

708
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
With the...

709
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,910
What are you looking at?

710
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,270
Huh?

711
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,850
What are you looking at?

712
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,230
Hmm?

713
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,770
That's right.

714
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,830
Walk away!

715
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,730
You want me to tell my father about you?

716
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,590
Ha ha ha ha.

717
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,450
Ha ha ha.

718
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,370
Ha ha ha.

719
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:19,830
Ha ha ha.

720
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,350
Ha ha ha.

721
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,490
There's also...

722
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,950
The tomato one is a little silly.

723
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,170
Because like...

724
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:29,590
You know...

725
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,670
It's a little more silly.

726
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:31,410
But the...

727
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,070
Uh...

728
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,590
But the dragoon hoodie...

729
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,330
It looks more...

730
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:35,850
You know...

731
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,270
It looks more like...

732
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,910
Like...

733
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,330
Uh...

734
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,190
The class bully.

735
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,830
I'm...

736
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,930
I'm...

737
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,980
Huh?

738
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,060
Hmm.

739
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,840
Ha ha ha ha.

740
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,540
And then...

741
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,360
Put down.

742
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,120
Ha ha ha.

743
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,000
And then...

744
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,600
What about it?

745
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,540
That's right.

746
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,340
What are you looking at?

747
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,340
You're here to give me your lunch money?

748
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,020
Ha ha ha.

749
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
Ha ha ha.

750
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,360
That's right.

751
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,220
WAH!

752
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,800
If you're not here to give me my lunch money!

753
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,080
And then, obviously, so...

754
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,200
This was something...

755
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,860
I wanted to do for a while.

756
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,000
Because...

757
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,860
You know, it's really hard to include Dad...

758
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,600
In streams, because, you know, when he's on top of my head...

759
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,280
He takes up so much of my space.

760
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,560
So, I just... I wanted him to, like...

761
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,160
I wanted him to, like...

762
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,700
Actually, I could actually, like...

763
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,800
Not have him take up majority of my space.

764
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,840
Uh...

765
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,040
So...

766
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,620
So, I was just like...

767
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,380
Okay, you're...

768
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,060
Can I have...

769
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,940
Can I have...

770
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,500
Hold him?

771
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,020
Can I hold Mr. Class President?

772
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,760
Yeah, so...

773
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,500
So, look at him.

774
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,320
Look at him go.

775
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,920
Oh, wait, here.

776
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,620
Let me show you his feet for free.

777
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,080
Alright.

778
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,340
Look at how long he is!

779
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,440
He's so long!

780
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,600
Look at him!

781
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,280
Wow!

782
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,300
He's such a long boy!

783
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,460
Wow!

784
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,800
Oh, yeah.

785
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,900
I could take this off, too.

786
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,980
Wow!

787
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,260
Look at this long boy!

788
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,380
Long, long boy!

789
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,960
Um...

790
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,640
But, yeah.

791
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,680
I don't...

792
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,700
I know, like...

793
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,780
No comment.

794
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,280
Also, so, another bad luck thing happened to me.

795
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,280
Um...

796
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,240
I was actually supposed to have...

797
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,280
A...

798
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Um...

799
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,860
A custom background, too.

800
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,980
But, the person who was making my custom background...

801
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,120
Had a...

802
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,860
Family Emergence...

803
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,020
I know, I didn't...

804
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,240
I'm not supposed to laugh at that.

805
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,010
But, I just thought it was funny how...

806
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,420
Unlucky I've been for this outfit reveal.

807
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,460
So...

808
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,580
He had a...

809
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,640
Family Emergence.

810
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,860
So, that's why I had to, like, try and find...

811
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,120
I had to find a background, too.

812
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,120
So...

813
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,900
So, this is what the background was supposed to look like.

814
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,720
And I was supposed to, like, be at your desk.

815
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
I...

816
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,340
You know...

817
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,120
I can't...

818
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,340
This was supposed to be...

819
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,660
But, it will be done.

820
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,180
Um...

821
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,140
It will be done, eventually.

822
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,240
It just didn't make it in time.

823
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,360
For...

824
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,020
Uh...

825
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,660
For...

826
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm laughing because of how unlucky I was.

827
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,320
And...

828
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,220
So...

829
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,840
Um...

830
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,620
But, yes, it's gonna...

831
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,720
This is what the background was supposed to look like.

832
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,300
And there was gonna be, like...

833
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,720
You know...

834
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,120
Other...

835
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,460
Other students and everything.

836
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,900
But, you know, that's just something to look forward to.

837
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,160
When it does come.

838
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,600
You know?

839
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,300
Um...

840
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,460
Anyway, we have...

841
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,200
What have I been?!

842
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,140
I'm sorry!

843
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,960
Sorry, I was...

844
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,980
Sorry, I was just roleplaying.

845
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,760
I was roleplaying as the class bully.

846
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,780
Guys, I...

847
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,180
That...

848
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,900
Sorry, I...

849
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,780
I got too into the character.

850
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,900
What's that word called?

851
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,280
When...

852
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,560
When you're an actor and you got, like, too into the character.

853
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:08,820
You're...

854
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,480
You're...

855
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:09,780
You're...

856
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,080
You're...

857
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,760
Sorry.

858
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,140
I was just...

859
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,900
Uh...

860
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,960
I was doing method acting, guys.

861
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,100
It was just method acting, everybody.

862
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,780
I swear to God.

863
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,680
I...

864
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,320
But anyway.

865
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,140
Um...

866
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,300
So...

867
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,100
Um...

868
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,600
I will show you guys...

869
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,260
Wait, I actually wrote a list of all this...

870
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,420
Oh!

871
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:34,880
Oh!

872
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,900

Before I show you the, uh...

875
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,840
Behind the scenes stuff.

Um...

877
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,940
I do have something special to give you guys.

878
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,320
So...

00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,840
Um...

00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,260
Well, the new outfit comes with a new wallpaper!

894
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,180
Download link.

895
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,740
I can't pin it because...

896
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:07,940
Okay.

897
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,580
Okay.

Just so you guys know.

899
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,300
There is a very special announcement right after the stream.

900
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:12,980
So...

901
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,260

00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,520
So I'm gonna pin the wallpaper.

905
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,200
But just so you guys know.

906
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,580
There is a very special announcement...

At the...

910
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,240
At the end of the stream.

911
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,140
So like...

912
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,660
You got...

913
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
Be there or be square.

914
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,600
Uh...

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,380
So let me, uh...

00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,220
So let's buy salt.

917
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,880
Uh...

918
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,960

Um...

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,340
Artwork too.

932
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,100
For your free wallpaper as well.

933
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,860
Uh...

934
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,220

00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,120
A free wallpaper for everybody!

00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,000
Yay!

938
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,100
Um...

00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,080
But that's not all.

940
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,360
Sorry.

941
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,260
There's a lot of announcements.

942
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,200
It's...

943
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,840
It's...

944
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:01,900
It's a...

945
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,680
This birthday...

946
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,800
There's a lot of stuff going on.

947
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,460
This birthday.

948
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,220
So...

949
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:05,880
Um...

950
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,340
I have a lot of stuff to show you guys.

951
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
I love free stuff!

952
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,240
Me too!

953
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,320
Okay, but the next...

954
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,200
A few things aren't free.

955
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:12,840
Uh...

956
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,720
The next couple of stuff may or may not be free, guys.

957
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,370
It may...

958
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:29,670
Okay, let me move to the side a little bit so I can properly show some stuff to you guys.

959
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,550
So...

960
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,370
Um...

961
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:31,890
Other thing...

962
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,990
Okay, so I'll talk about the behind the scenes stuff.

963
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,030
For...

964
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,550
Uh...

965
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,550
This new outfit.

966
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:38,750
Um...

967
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,290
So...

968
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,090
Originally, I wanted...

969
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,250
To have something related to...

970
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:45,670
I really...

971
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,930
I just wanted a hoodie.

972
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:47,750
Like a...

973
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,830
A mascot hoodie.

974
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,310
You know?

975
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,030
Just...

976
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,690
As a throwback.

977
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,490
Because I always thought they were super cute.

978
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,270
So...

979
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,010
I wanted...

980
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,250
Like...

981
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,150
A mascot hoodie.

982
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,810
And I gave like several ideas.

983
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,650
I was like...

984
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,210
It could be...

985
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,950
Dragoon.

986
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,830
It could be...

987
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,090
Tomato.

988
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,250
It could be...

989
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,610
Croaky.

990
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,570
So...

991
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:02,810
Um...

992
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,330
To my mama.

993
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,090
And...

994
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,390
This is fully designed by my mama.

995
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,130
So...

996
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,910
These are the concept art that...

997
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,210
Uh...

998
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,410
She gave me.

999
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,590
And...

1000
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,090
Um...

1001
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,390
In terms of like...

1002
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:13,670
Um...

1003
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,330
Because I was like...

1004
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,170
Oh, I really want...

1005
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,670
I really wanted like...

1006
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,510
Um...

1007
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,710
Something related to like...

1008
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,010
A hoodie.

1009
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,090
That's sort of like...

1010
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:20,470
You know?

1011
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,290
Like a mascot hoodie.

1012
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,550
I don't know why croaky's blue.

1013
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,050
I...

1014
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,190
I don't...

1015
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:45,210
I don't...

1016
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,670
I...

1017
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,750
It wasn't...

1018
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,010
Meant to be for...

1019
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:48,990
A school themed.

1020
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,110
I just wanted a casual wear.

1021
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:51,490
Oh...

1022
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:51,590
Wait.

1023
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,850
Sorry.

1024
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,650
My food's here.

1025
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,250
Sorry guys.

1026
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,930

1027
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,330
I've been up since 10am prepping for this stream.

1028
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,770
When I say there's a lot of stuff...

1029
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,090
That's gonna be...

1030
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,490
Announced.

1031
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,490
Well, not announced.

1032
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,490
But there's a lot of stuff that's gonna be going on...

1033
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,670

1034

So like...

1035
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,930

00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,510
School lunch time!

1043
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,270
Anyway...

1044
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,670
Anyway...

1045
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:35,030
Um...

1046
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,090
I saw concept C.

1047
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,110
And then...

1048
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:38,530
That...

1049
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,390
Was what made me go...

1050
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,570

1051
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,770
School outfit theme.

1052
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,750
Because I got...

1053
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,830
Super inspired by concept C.

1054
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,690
So...

1055
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,710

1056
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,490

1057
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,210
My...

1058
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,370
Um...

00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,770
These were my...

1060
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:52,890
Uh...

1061
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:53,590
I guess...

1062
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,130
What's the word?

1063
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,170
Uh...

1064
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:55,910
Inspirations.

1065
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,230
So I sent...

1066
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,370

1067
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,090

1069
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,570

Um...

1076
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,970
Because I never had a...

1077
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:07,190
You know...

1078
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,010
I never had a school themed...

1079
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,050
Um... outfit before.

1080
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,630
I just sent in...

1081
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,530
Um...

1082
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:13,870
Stuff like...

1083
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,170
You know...

1084
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,050
Animal hoodies.

1085
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,050
And stuff like that.

1086
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:18,150
Um...

1087
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,750
And...

1088
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,290
And then...

1089
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:21,850
I really wanted...

1090
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,110
Something where I was...

1091
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,030
Holding my phone.

1092
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:24,770
So...

1093
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,830
My phone is actually...

1094
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,950
Uh...

1095
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:27,430
Decora.

1096
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,350
Uh...

1097
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:28,770
I don't know if you...

1098
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:29,770
Okay, so like...

1099
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,870
Men might not know what this is.

1100
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,330
But...

1101
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,490
But...

1102
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,050
I've always wanted to do...

1103
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,550
Um...

1104
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,110
Decora phones.

1105
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,490
So it's basically like...

1106
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:42,870

We can learn!

1111
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,070
Uh...

1112
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:49,290
Okay.

1113
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,010
Decodent.

1114
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,590
Or...

1115
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,250
Decocases.

1116
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:52,670
And...

1117
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:53,650

1118
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,330

1119
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,230
So I've always wanted...

1120
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,550

00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,050
Do...

1123
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,690
It's basically like an arts and crafts shit.

1124
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:02,330
Where you...

1125
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,710
There's like cafes themed around like...

1126
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,230
Uh...

1127
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,210
Deco cases.

1128
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:06,810
And like...

1129
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,970
You just sit down and like...

1130
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,130
They give you like...

1131
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:10,070
These icing pipes.

1132
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:10,770
And like...

1133
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,210
That are like plastic...

1134
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,010
That are filled with like...

1135
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,710
Plastic and stuff.

1136
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:14,850
And...

1137
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:15,010
Uh...

00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,650
30% girl gang!

1139
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:17,570
Rise up!

1140
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,190
And then you sit down and like...

1141
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,030
Decorate like...

1142
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,070
A clear phone case.

1143
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,330
And they'll have like...

1144
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,370
Charms and everything.

1145
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:24,630
And...

1146
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,950
Uh...

1147
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,950
Little charms...

1148
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:26,390
And like...

1149
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,210
Little decorations.

1150
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:27,890
And stuff like that.

1151
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,410
So that's my phone case right here.

1152
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:29,950
So...

1153
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,290
That's what was the...

1154
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:32,490
Inspiration...

1155
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,270
For...

1156
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:34,710
Um...

1157
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,430
For the phone.

1158
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:36,390
And that was like the one thing.

1159
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:36,870
I was like...

1160
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,990
I must have...

1161
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,550
A...

1162
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,450
A deco phone case.

1163
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,690
That is dragon themed.

1164
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:42,370
Uh...

1165
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,130
Because I love our school mascot.

1166
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,170
So much!

1167
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,510
And then of course...

1168
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,110
I was like...

1169
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,010
I would like an outfit for dad.

1170
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,870
And then my mama drew this.

1171
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:53,490
And I was like...

1172
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,830
Perfect!

1173
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:54,770
Uh...

1174
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,830
Our little class president.

1175
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:58,290
Uh...

1176
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,210
I love...

1177
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:00,950
And so...

1178
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:01,790
After I said...

1179
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:02,950
I wanted a...

1180
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,950
Squib...

1181
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,470
Um...

1182
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,290
Outfit themed.

1183
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,490
Uh...

1184
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,510
My...

1185
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,290
Uh...

1186
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:08,750
Okay...

1187
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,390
My mama sent me...

1188
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,990
Oh my gosh.

1189
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:11,230
Sorry.

1190
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,110
I cut dad in half.

1191
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:12,710
But like...

1192
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,990
Don't worry.

1193
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:13,830
There's a reason why.

1194
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:14,570
Um...

1195
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,870
I sent in...

1196
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,330
Uh...

1197
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,590
My mama sent...

1198
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,110
This to me.

1199
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:19,930
So...

1200
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,310
Um...

1201
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,710
As you can see...

1202
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,630
We were also supposed to have...

1203
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,790
Hairstyle...

1204
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,090
Too.

1205
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,650
Um...

1206
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,530
But...

1207
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:28,770
Um...

1208
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,390
We sort of forgot...

1209
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,830
It went missing...

1210
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:34,370
During...

1211
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,430
It was forgot...

1212
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,710
Like...

1213
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,750
I think like...

1214
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,530
It was either like...

1215
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:38,830
Um...

1216
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,690
Cause I don't know...

1217
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,870
We don't know if it was like...

1218
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:41,370
My mama...

1219
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,270
Was like...

1220
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:42,510
Oh wait.

1221
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,390
Let me try and find it.

1222
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,130
So I haven't heard...

1223
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:44,510
Like...

1224
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,370
Uh...

1225
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,450
I didn't get another email yet.

1226
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:48,210
About like...

1227
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,890
What happened to the missing hairstyle.

1228
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,050
Uh...

1229
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:51,510
But yes.

1230
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,230
We're supposed to have hairstyle...

1231
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:53,590
Too.

1232
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,190
As well.

1233
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,290
Uh...

1234
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:58,850
Um...

1235
00:45:58,850 --> 00:45:59,110
But...

1236
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,310
It's gonna be added later.

1237
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,250
So...

1238
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,390
Just like the...

1239
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:03,470
Background...

1240
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,010
Um...

1241
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,430
Just like the background...

1242
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,090
Um...

1243
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:06,930
We're gonna have...

1244
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,950
The second hairstyle...

1245
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,850
At a later time.

1246
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,870
Uh...

1247
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,050
No.

1248
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,350
I read the email.

1249
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:12,690
But like...

1250
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,550
Um...

1251
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,250
Um...

1252
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,930
I'm waiting for the...

1253
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,130
The next email.

1254
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:17,990
About like...

1255
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,310
The new...

1256
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:18,590
The hairstyle.

1257
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,250
Where it went.

1258
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,350
Cause it wasn't in our files.

1259
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:22,050
Like...

1260
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,070
It wasn't in any of the files I was sent.

1261
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:24,730
So we're...

1262
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,710
So I'm waiting for the email...

1263
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,590
Of like...

1264
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,010
Where...

1265
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,130
What happened to the second hairstyle.

1266
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,310
Hahaha.

1267
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,310
Hahaha.

1268
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:34,370
Hahaha.

1269
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:35,410
So...

1270
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,310
It's tomato time.

1271
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,250
Anyway...

1272
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,790
So, as you guys can see, we were trying to decide, like, the school uniform.

1273
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,430
And I decided, you know, I wanted it not to be a tie.

1274
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,210
I wanted it to be a ribbon.

1275
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,050
And then you can see that, you know, basically the concept was there already.

1276
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,570
Like, we didn't really change much till the final version.

1277
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,290
And then after that, the final version was...

1278
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,750
Whoa, what happened?

1279
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:03,990
Okay.

1280
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,530
Let's switch the final version after that.

1281
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:08,310
So...

1282
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,550
So, we were supposed to have, you know...

1283
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,190
Oh, yeah, I also changed the phone case color because I didn't like the blue in the end.

1284
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,310
But...

1285
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,290
But yes, this is basically what it ended up looking like in the end.

1286
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,970
So, you can see that, you know, like...

1287
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,690
From... for Dragoon Academy.

1288
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,630
Oh, wait, my vest.

1289
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,310
What happened to my...

1290
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,690
From Dragoon Academy.

1291
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:36,330
So...

1292
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:37,790
Um...

1293
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,350
Um...

1294
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:38,410
Um...

1295
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,810
But yeah, I thought it was...

1296
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,970
I thought it turned out really good in the end.

1297
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,950
I'm really happy with how it came out.

1298
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:44,350
And I...

1299
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,510
I love... I was like, I want a lollipop.

1300
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,870
Because I looked how much of a...

1301
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:49,930
Um...

1302
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,090
I looked at how much, you know...

1303
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:52,930
I was like...

1304
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,730
Like, you know...

1305
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,470
Like a delinquent.

1306
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,970
So I was like, oh, I gotta get lollipop in too.

1307
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,150
So I can be like...

1308
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,310
By the way...

1309
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:07,390
Um...

1310
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,150
I can...

1311
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,830
Do other stuff with it as well.

1312
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:10,890
So...

1313
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,570
Let me...

1314
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,510
Let me put the hoodie down.

1315
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:14,830
So...

1316
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,290
Um...

1317
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,690
I can...

1318
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,550
My other stuff works for it as well.

1319
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,310
So...

1320
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,250
Can you give me your lunch money?

1321
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,090
Ha ha ha ha!

1322
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,190
Ha ha ha!

1323
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,350
Ha ha ha!

1324
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:28,810
Ha ha ha!

1325
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:29,750
Ha ha ha!

1326
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,210
And obviously...

1327
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:31,990
You know...

1328
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,570
Dad and his...

1329
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,970
Mr. Class President on my head too.

1330
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,870
There's Mr. Class President.

1331
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,370
And...

1332
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:40,250
Um...

1333
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,050
Let's see.

1334
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,470
Ooh...

1335
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,490
Oh my gosh.

1336
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,250
And then...

1337
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:48,970
Yeah?

1338
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:50,090
Ha ha ha!

1339
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,330
Of course!

1340
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,350
I am the star student of Class 1A.

1341
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,490
Of course I am!

1342
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,490
Or who is it?

1343
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,430
DA.

1344
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,370
Ha ha ha!

1345
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:00,670
D1.

1346
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:01,750
Ha ha ha!

1347
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,070
Ha ha ha!

1348
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:03,710
Of course!

1349
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,090
I'm so innocent!

1350
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:05,770
Ha ha ha!

1351
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:06,390
Me?

1352
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:07,390
Bullying?

1353
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:08,390
Changkun?

1354
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,210
I couldn't have done that Mrs. B.

1355
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,450
Look at me!

1356
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:13,670
Ha ha ha!

1357
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,650
Ha ha ha!

1358
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:14,990
Ha ha ha!

1359
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,190
And then...

1360
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,470
Who tattled on me?

1361
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,430
Who's that snitch?

1362
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,510
Ha ha ha!

1363
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,250
Oh yeah.

1364
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,870
And...

1365
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,810
By the way...

1366
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,010
um...

1367
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,150
By the way...

1368
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,130
This also works...

1369
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,570
And...

1370
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,110
The best part is that...

1371
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,930
It also works...

1372
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,730
With a hoodie.

1373
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:36,690
Ha ha ha!

1374
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,270
Ha ha ha!

1375
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,990
Ha ha ha!

1376
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,090
It works...

1377
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:43,730
It...

1378
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,150
It..

1379
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,830
It works with the hoodie as well.

1380
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,910
So...

1381
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:47,630
So...

1382
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:47,890
Yay!

1383
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:57,790
Alright, let me... let me get back... back to... back to short neck here.

1384
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,730
And then, blank eyes.

1385
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:04,990
And...

1386
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,350
Wait, what's this?

1387
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:06,690
Oh yeah.

1388
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,330
Oh yeah, I'm not a nerd, alright?

1389
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,090
I just have really bad eyesight, okay?

1390
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,790
I just play too much video games.

1391
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,150
I'm not a nerd like you.

1392
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:22,670
That's different.

1393
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,810
I'm not like one of you.

1394
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:32,270
Call me a nerd one more time, I'm gonna stuff you in that locker.

1395
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,490
And then, this one might...

1396
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,690
I don't know, every time... every time it's like that, I like to be like...

1397
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,210
And then... oh my god.

1398
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,250
Oh...

1399
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,130
Mrs. B gave too much homework.

1400
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,300
I have to...

1401
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,210
I have to stay up and do...

1402
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:58,410
Algebra.

1403
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,380
And then, obviously, I have, you know...

1404
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,590
These...

1405
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,790
Jesus, if you're here.

1406
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,530
Algebra.

1407
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,650
And of course...

1408
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,130
Dough Kitty.

1409
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,870
Dough Kitty's school art.

1410
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:18,870
War...

1411
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:19,970
War...

1412
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,950
But thank you, thank you guys.

1413
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,110
So thank you everybody for the Akasupa!

1414
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,130
Thank you, thank you!

1415
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:28,990
I really appreciate it, guys.

1416
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,970
Thank you everyone.

1417
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:33,650
But yes, Dough Kitty is also here as well.

1418
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,090
And I think like...

1419
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,250
I think those are...

1420
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,090
I mean, they're definitely not all the Tagos.

1421
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:38,730
But...

1422
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,550
This is one of...

1423
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,430
Some of them that I can show you guys.

1424
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,170
So, I know I'm like...

1425
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,170
Sort of zooming a little bit.

1426
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,330
But you'll understand later.

1427
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,250
You'll understand later.

1428
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:50,930
But...

1429
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,230
You know...

1430
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:53,970
Remember when I said...

1431
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:55,510
Uh...

1432
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,770
Remember when I said that...

1433
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,630
There's a lot of stuff to show you guys.

1434
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,590
This isn't an announcement.

1435
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:01,450
But like...

1436
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,450
There's a lot of stuff I want to go through with you guys.

1437
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,490
For my birthday.

1438
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:05,590
And...

1439
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,590
One of them...

1440
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,610
Is...

1441
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,490
Is that...

1442
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,450
We have finally...

1443
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,210
Relaunched...

1444
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,330
The Dough Kitty merch website!

1445
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:17,510
Yes!

1446
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,770
Also, my third monitor died again!

1447
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,090
Woo!

1448
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,510
Oh my god, sorry.

1449
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,410
I almost...

1450
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,990
I'm a mess right now!

1451
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,790
I'm a mess!

1452
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:28,570
I'm a mess!

1453
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:28,790
But...

1454
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,550
Dough Kitty merch has been...

1455
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,030
Fli...

1456
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,690
Fully relaunched...

1457
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,070
In a way that...

1458
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,510
Our distributor has finally finished...

1459
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:37,590
Um...

1460
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:37,890
Doing...

1461
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,830
Doing all the logistics...

1462
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,050
Off of...

1463
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:41,350
Uh...

1464
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,250
For Dough Kitty merch.

1465
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,050
So...

1466
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:43,550
Oh my gosh.

1467
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,190
Sorry.

1468
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,070
I dropped my...

1469
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:45,590
My...

1470
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,110
I'm a little silly today.

1471
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:49,030
I don't...

1472
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,110
I'm a little silly.

1473
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:50,470
The...

1474
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,550
My steam deck...

1475
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:53,990
Uh...

1476
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,930
So I need to remember how to...

1477
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,870
Place my steam deck.

1478
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:58,550
Okay, there you go.

1479
00:52:58,830 --> 00:52:59,070
Alright.

1480
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,710
And I need to fix my third monitor.

1481
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,030
Cause I can't look at...

1482
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:02,150
Chat.

1483
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:07,890
Uh...

1484
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,190
Third monitor!

1485
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,030
Why are you not working?

1486
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:14,670
Why are you not working?

1487
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:15,850
It has been like...

1488
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,070
A little bit of a nuisance.

1489
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:18,990
I might have to change my monitor.

1490
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,430
Um...

1491
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,330
I think it's cause like...

1492
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,590
All three of my monitors are super...

1493
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,070
Uh...

1494
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,530
Are super powerful.

1495
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:27,530
And it like...

1496
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,150
I don't think my PC can handle it.

1497
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:29,790
I...

1498
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,770
Um...

1499
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,390
There you go.

1500
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,190
Yay!

1501
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,170
I can see...

1502
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,450
I can see you guys now!

1503
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39,050
Yay!

1504
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:40,770
Uh...

1505
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,150
So...

1506
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,910
We have...

1507
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,470
A lot of drops happening right now...

1508
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,830
On Doki Merch.

1509
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:47,110
So...

1510
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:48,030
Here's another thing.

1511
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,890
I guess it's another thing to...

1512
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:52,430
Um...

1513
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:52,750

1514
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,470
To pin right now for you guys.

1515
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:55,590
So...

1516
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,090
Uh...

00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,550
I'll show you guys real quick.

1518
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,710
On all the stuff.

1519
00:53:59,050 --> 00:53:59,590

1520
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:00,570
Doki Merch!

1521
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,650
Uh...

1522
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,870
Make sure everything is good.

1523
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:03,770
Alright.

1524
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:04,770
So...

1525
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:06,990
Doki Merch.

1526
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,350
Doki Merch, show up!

1527
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,710
Doki Merch?

1528
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,630
Hahahaha!

1529
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:15,810
Oh, there you go!

1530
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:16,250
Oh, ok.

1531
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:16,770
There you go.

1532
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,810
Doki Merch!

1533
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,490
Hello, Doki Merch!

1534
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,810
So, as you guys can see...

1535
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,050
Uh...

1536
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:24,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1537
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,230
Let me...

1538
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,570
As you guys can see...

1539
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,170
Uh...

1540
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,090
We have...

1541
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,170
A big launch.

1542
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,590
A big website launch.

1543
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:32,150
So...

1544
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,390
This is our new distributor.

1545
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,710
We actually have some of the items in stock...

1546
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:38,430
Uh...

1547
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,150
Right now.

1548
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:46,050
So, if you order some of the items right now, including the... I think the gibbets... yeah.

1549
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,730
We have some of them in the warehouse at the moment.

1550
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,930
Oh, do you guys see this?

1551
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,350
Yes, it's the birthday bundle!

1552
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:54,510
Yes!

1553
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,190
Sorry, it's in Canadian.

1554
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:04,310
But, so the birthday bundle includes artwork drawn by my... oh, my monitor died again.

1555
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,830
Goddammit!

1556
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,390
Okay, drawn by my mama!

1557
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,770
And it includes from this bundle.

1558
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,010
You can buy all these individually, by the way.

1559
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:21,550
But, you can get a postcard, which comes with a bundle.

1560
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,570
So, by buying this bundle, you get the postcard.

1561
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,490
It gets the checky.

1562
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:29,030
There's a patch for Dragoon Academy.

1563
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:34,230
So, you can grab the... it's like an embroidered patch for Dragoon Academy.

1564
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,090
And there's a really cute... look at this chibi stand!

1565
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,170
It's so cute!

1566
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,550
Uh... yeah, it's 76 Canadian.

1567
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,010
So, that's like 8 US dollars, right?

1568
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,050
So, yes!

1569
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,890
A lot of items for the birthday bundle.

1570
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,310
But, that's not all.

1571
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,550
As you guys can see, we have... oh, this one.

1572
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,310
So, this one was actually from you guys.

1573
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,690
You guys made the... uh... the happy.

1574
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:04,810
Uh... and we loved it so much that we made it an official merch.

1575
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,830
So, it is a little bit different from the fan merch.

1576
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:17,210
But, this one is... um... this one is basically... uh... the happy that... and we replaced the text with our logo.

1577
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,850
And we added in... I think... I don't remember which one we added in.

1578
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:25,690
But, uh... from the... but we made it an an official... uh... an official happy.

1579
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,890
For those who are wondering if the checkies are hand signed...

1580
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:35,510
For this collection, I did not... I did not... um... do any autographed items.

1581
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:39,290
Because I am... right now... really swamped.

1582
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,870
Right now!

1583
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,250
I am... I am... I am... I am... I am sorry.

1584
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:47,290
I was so swamped the last... the last couple of months.

1585
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,390
I couldn't... I couldn't sign anything.

1586
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:54,890
Um... but we also... not only that, but you can also get the retro Doki plushie!

1587
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,450
Right now!

1588
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,530
Okay, not right now.

1589
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:58,290
This is pre-order.

1590
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,850
But... this is a pre-order item.

1591
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:04,730
But, for those who don't know, this... my distributor is Gamersupps.

1592
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,290
So, like, you know, they're very trusting and everything.

1593
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,830
So, you know, we're not in the mess that we were in last year.

1594
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:14,450
Uh... so they do have some items in the warehouse right now.

1595
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,050
And I believe... if you go to live in stock...

1596
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,550
We are bringing... we brought back the Bounty Hunter acrylic stand, too!

1597
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:24,650
So you can basically... all these items that you see right now...

1598
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,450
Um... we have these three items in the warehouse at the moment.

1599
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,990
So you can basically order these and you'll receive it.

1600
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,990
Um... um... so if you guys... you know what?

1601
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,270
The Doki... the Doki Bounty Hunter acrylic sand...

1602
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:42,430
The gibbets... uh... and the... uh... red pocket envelopes.

1603
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:45,030
Um... the other stuff we have... so here's the pre-order.

1604
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,890
Um... we have a Christmas sweater.

1605
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,750
By the way, the photo looks really dark, but they're actually a lot lighter.

1606
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,550
And it's really... it's really comfy.

1607
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,250
And then... oh, I love this one.

1608
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:57,290
This is the... the desk mat.

1609
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,370
So, um... this is one of my favorite Japanese artists.

1610
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:06,690
Uh... so... here is like... a... um... a little... really... uh... what's the word called?

1611
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,890
Aesthetic desk mat.

1612
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:15,870
You know, with all these colors and all these dragoons and everything.

1613
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:20,790
So, we have this really cute desk mat too that you can get right now.

1614
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,930
And then look at this dragoon beanie!

1615
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:30,450
So, if you're a beanie user, we have a dragoon beanie here too.

1616
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,850
And then, oh, I love this chibi acrylic sand.

1617
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:34,710
Look at this sand.

1618
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,590
It's so cute.

1619
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,090
So, it's a three-piece.

1620
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:44,450
So, there's the background that's themed around this outfit.

1621
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:48,030
So, there's me taking a selfie with Mr. Class President.

1622
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,330
And he's very easily bribed by the way.

1623
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:52,690
Just kidding.

1624
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,650
But here's the little chibi set.

1625
00:58:58,790 --> 00:58:59,910
I thought it was super cute.

1626
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:12,450
And also, you can purchase the Hawaiian dog shirt or pet shirt if you want to dress up your pet in a Hawaiian hot dog shirt.

1627
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,910
You can get it now as well.

1628
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,270
You can pre-order this right now too.

1629
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:22,910
So, the one... Look!

1630
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:23,170
See?

1631
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,230
It's... Look!

1632
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,510
Doki bird talk dog.

1633
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:27,270
Aloha!

1634
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:31,630
And, if you guys didn't see...

1635
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:37,030
The retro Doki stand is also back.

1636
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,950
And it's going to be there on the store forever.

1637
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:49,070
So, if you haven't been able to get the retro stand, we are offering it now on the store as well.

1638
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,510
And then there's the patch.

1639
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,750
The embroidered patch.

1640
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:52,010
Sorry.

1641
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:53,030
The render is like...

1642
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,150
This is a render right now.

1643
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,270
We're still waiting for the sample at the moment.

1644
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,510
But it's going to be a embroidered patch for the Dragoon Academy.

1645
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,630
And there's the checky!

1646
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,390
And then there's a secret message here.

1647
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:07,850
I don't know if you can unblur this, but yes.

1648
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:13,570
There's the... There's the checky with a secret message in the back and everything.

1649
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,050
Yay!

1650
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:15,450
But yeah!

1651
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,510
I hope you guys are excited about... About the store... The new store.

1652
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:21,570
I'm really happy.

1653
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:28,190
We worked... Me... My staff team and Gamersupps worked incredibly hard on the launch of the store.

1654
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:34,410
We actually... They actually, like... Um... Um... We're... We're working on it, like, a couple of hours ago.

1655
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:39,930
They finished the store launch, like, I think an hour before the stream was about to go live.

1656
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:43,930
So, that's what's like... They've been working on this website for, like, months.

1657
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:49,010
And, um... We're fi... The fact that we're finally... It's finally launched!

1658
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:49,650
Yay!

1659
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,850
Oh, I thought this one was really cute.

1660
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:59,090
So, if you go light mode... If you go light mode, it swaps to RetroDoki.

1661
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,270
Um... And, obviously, I'm gonna add more to the gallery and everything.

1662
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,790
And, um... Like, all the references of all my outfits.

1663
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,590
And then these are all the people I've worked with.

1664
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,390
And then there's the video gallery.

1665
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,750
And... But yeah, I thought it was such a cute little feature.

1666
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:16,290
When you swap to light mode, it's RetroDoki.

1667
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,910
And then dark mode is me, because I guess I'm evil.

1668
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:19,870
Ha ha ha!

1669
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:25,650
Um...

1670
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,790
Um... And then here would be the events calendar.

1671
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:31,150
So, if you're like, oh, where is... Where is Doki...?

1672
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,590
Where is Doki Bird?

1673
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,750
You know, where is Carmen Sandia?

1674
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:35,810
I don't know, Santiago.

1675
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:41,230
You can look at the events and like, oh, that's where she is.

1676
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,990
That's where she's gonna go right now.

1677
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:50,150
But yes, I am super happy about the store launch and everything.

1678
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,290
Look at all these.

1679
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:52,650
Oh, the beanie is so cute.

1680
01:01:52,930 --> 01:02:01,930
But yeah, I hope you guys have a better experience now with my merch.

1681
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,830
And yay, that's me!

1682
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,130
Happy birthday, Jokey!

1683
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:05,570
Yay!

1684
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:13,630
But yes, this is all handled by Gamersupps for me.

1685
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:19,810
So they are my distributor and they help me with making my ideas into reality.

1686
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:24,510
So if you guys ever, you know, order stuff with Gamersupps, they've been like, you know, super...

1687
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:32,510
They've been like really good with their customer service and also their, um, of how they handle merch and everything.

1688
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:39,810
So yeah, I hope you guys, you know, have a more fun time and enjoy all the Jokey merch for your shrine!

1689
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:40,590
Yay!

1690
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:47,110
Alright, so yes, that is not the official announcement, by the way.

1691
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:51,350
That was not the official announcement of what I was gonna tell you guys.

1692
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,090
Because I have other stuff that I want to show you.

1693
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,250
Uh, oh.

1694
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:01,170
I got myself some cookies and cake.

1695
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,390
So let me show you guys.

1696
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,150
Uh, oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

1697
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:09,350
But, um, let me show you guys, uh...

1698
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,550
This little cake that I got.

1699
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:15,050
Yay!

1700
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:17,310
It's all of you guys!

1701
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:17,550
Nice!

1702
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:21,570
Also, that's like the evil goon with the knife ready to cut.

1703
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:22,230
Look!

1704
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,570
I gotta look at this cake I got!

1705
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:26,850
Dragoons!

1706
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:27,790
Isn't it cute?

1707
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,950
Yeah, that's you!

1708
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:34,750
Wait, actually, they said they would send me a video of the baking of the cake.

1709
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:37,770
I don't know if they sent... Let me double check real quick.

1710
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,130
Oh, wait, they did!

1711
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,150
Oh my god!

1712
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:41,510
Wait, let me see.

1713
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,150
Oh, they did!

1714
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:46,090
They sent the video of them making the cake!

1715
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:46,330
Cake!

1716
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,210
Okay, I'm downloading it right now.

1717
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,630
Let's watch this together.

1718
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,830
Oh my god, it's so cute!

1719
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,050
I know, I'm so excited.

1720
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,450
I'm really excited to try this cake out.

1721
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,630
It looks so cute.

1722
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:06,150
But yes, there's all... Look at all these... Look at all these little guys!

1723
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,150
That's so cute!

1724
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,510
Alright, let's see.

1725
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:12,450
I should never...

1726
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:16,990
My manager messaged me and was like... Careful!

1727
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:20,650
Okay, let me send this video to my manager first.

1728
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,070
And have them watch the video!

1729
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,110
To be sure!

1730
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,410
Because I can't watch it right now.

1731
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:31,090
I...

1732
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,310
I... I forgot the flavor.

1733
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:38,410
I actually... I actually forgot what flavor it is.

1734
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:39,290
But I thought...

1735
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,690
This was super cute.

1736
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,490
And like, if you see the side...

1737
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,770
There's like mini dragoons on the side...

1738
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:45,430
As well.

1739
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,790
But not only that...

1740
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,830
But I also got cookies made too!

1741
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:50,750
Look!

1742
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,210
Yeah, I got dra... Oh my gosh!

1743
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:55,170
Okay, so...

1744
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:56,250
For the cookies...

1745
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,230
Um, I'm gonna show you guys the video for this.

1746
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:02,270
But I asked them if they could give you guys the recipe...

1747
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,970
On how to make your very own dragoon cookies as well.

1748
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,890
That video I watched because they sent it to me super early.

1749
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,110
But I...

1750
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,730
Um, I'll show the video as well.

1751
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:12,290
But...

1752
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:15,870
Um, they basically made a little tutorial for all of us...

1753
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,890
On how to make your very own dragoon sugar cookies.

1754
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,530
So, I'll play that video right now as well.

1755
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:23,090
Let me...

1756
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,570
Let me play that for you guys.

1757
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:25,630
I thought it was so cute.

1758
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,130
I was like...

1759
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:26,530
Oh my gosh!

1760
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:27,730
I asked them like...

1761
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:28,310
Um...

1762
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:29,070
I asked them like...

1763
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:30,050
Oh, can you like...

1764
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:31,770
Make a short video for us?

1765
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:32,430
So like...

1766
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,270
We can learn how to make these cookies?

1767
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:34,750
And...

1768
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,770
And she was like...

1769
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:36,290
Yeah, of course!

1770
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:37,210
Of course we can!

1771
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:41,270
Uh, so if anyone wants to make their very own dragoon cookies...

1772
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,230
Yay!

1773
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,510
Chocolate sugar cookies!

1774
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,250
Okay, um...

1775
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,550
Give me a sec for me...

1776
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,290
Oh my god!

1777
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:50,050
It's so fast!

1778
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:52,490
I realized...

1779
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:52,830
I was like...

1780
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:53,910
Wait, you can't even...

1781
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:54,990
Okay, here we go.

1782
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:55,830
Here we go.

1783
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:56,570
Okay, there we go.

1784
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,890
Now you can sort of see the instructions a little better.

1785
01:05:59,370 --> 01:05:59,770
Uh...

1786
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:00,570
I was like...

1787
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:02,910
When I'm covering like half the recipe...

1788
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,050
Oh my god, is it really loud?

1789
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:08,390
Okay, let me...

1790
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,270
Turn it down.

1791
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:11,930
So...

1792
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:13,390
Uh...

1793
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,810
Yeah, whisk to combine.

1794
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,870
Set aside.

1795
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,610
Next is the mixture.

1796
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:18,930
Grab, stand, mixture.

1797
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:19,250
Work.

1798
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:22,610
Okay, so sugar, butter, two eggs, vanilla extract.

1799
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:23,790
Put in green.

1800
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,110
Look at that, we're all learning!

1801
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,990
We're all learning together!

1802
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:31,650
Yippee!

1803
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,730
Bump, bump, bump.

1804
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:36,790
Take notes, guys!

1805
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,490
Take notes, you can make...

1806
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:39,890
Oh, sorry.

1807
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:40,570
Sorry.

1808
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,750
Take notes so you can make your own dragon cookies!

1809
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:45,970
Okay, go!

1810
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,110
Yay!

1811
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:49,770
Oh, you can hear.

1812
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:50,770
Okay, now you can hear me.

1813
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,470
Wrap in plastic wrap!

1814
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:56,810
Whoa!

1815
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,410
Look at...

1816
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,190
Look at them go!

1817
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,430
Flat end dough after wrapping!

1818
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,210
Are you taking notes?

1819
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,670
One hour later!

1820
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,050
Sprinkle flour on rolling surface!

1821
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:09,790
Dust flour...

1822
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,590
Oh my gosh!

1823
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:11,530
Roll out...

1824
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,310
Okay, you guys are gonna have to re-watch this.

1825
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,670
You're gonna have to re-watch this later.

1826
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,370
Oh, look, it's so cute!

1827
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:28,970
Oh, and then like, print it all out.

1828
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,390
And then they baked it.

1829
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,570
Time to make the royal icing!

1830
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,710
So they do...

1831
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:38,070
Look at...

1832
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:38,670
There it is.

1833
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:40,150
There's all the ingredients.

1834
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:42,250
Oh my god, wait.

1835
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,590
She just like...

1836
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,250
Wait, that's how you mix it?

1837
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,630
I haven't baked in so long.

1838
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:48,570
Ha ha ha ha!

1839
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:50,330
Instructions unclear!

1840
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:51,770
Ha ha ha ha!

1841
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:53,410
Ha ha ha!

1842
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:53,490
Ha ha ha!

1843
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:54,470
Ha ha ha!

1844
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,150
Use that egg goon to make our...

1845
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,310
Dragoon cookies!

1846
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,970
It's just that easy, guys!

1847
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,050
Ha ha ha!

1848
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:02,430
Ha ha ha!

1849
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,620
All right, portion all of these.

1850
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,540
Okay, but like, how much do I have to pour?

1851
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:10,840
Okay.

1852
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:11,660
Whoa!

1853
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,340
Oh, they're like the colors!

1854
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,420
Okay, color matching might be difficult.

1855
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,780
Ha ha ha!

1856
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:17,420
Ha ha ha!

1857
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,160
Please...

1858
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,200
Color matching might be a little bit difficult in here.

1859
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,420
Ha ha ha!

1860
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:23,880
Ha ha ha!

1861
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,300
Yippee!

1862
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,640
Cannibalism!

1863
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,820
Oh, and then they like...

1864
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,060
They like...

1865
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,340
Do outlines and stuff.

1866
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,800
Okay, knowing me, I'm not gonna do any outlines.

1867
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,760
Oh, I feel like I should do outlines though.

1868
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:34,640
Ha ha ha!

1869
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,400
My instructions are clear!

1870
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,680
I made a hydrogen bomb!

1871
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,820
Ha ha ha!

1872
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:41,220
Ha ha ha!

1873
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:44,680
You can't bake cookies without breaking a few egg goons, Jack!

1874
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,180
Ha ha ha ha!

1875
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,100
Oh, you have to have like, such steady hands for this too.

1876
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,240
Oh, keep going till all the cookies are decorated.

1877
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,340
Oh, that's cute!

1878
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,340
It's like they're going in one by one and then letting it dry.

1879
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,880
Oh, look!

1880
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,440
And then...

1881
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,620
I ate one by the way.

1882
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,420
The first cookie I ate was dead.

1883
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:04,260
It was so good.

1884
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,800
Ha ha ha ha!

1885
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,380
But look, it's so cute!

1886
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,460
Everything came out like so cute!

1887
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,260
I'm happy.

1888
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,680
But you know, I wanted to like, make this birthday a little special.

1889
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,120
And then like, make it themed around you guys.

1890
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,580
But alright, let's see the cake one too.

1891
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,180
I don't think the cake one has a recipe.

1892
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:29,480
So, um, I think it's just, you know, aesthetic cake baking.

1893
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:32,860
Ooh!

1894
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:34,660
Ooh!

1895
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:35,620
Look!

1896
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,940
Oh, that's cute!

1897
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,440
Look at...

1898
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,420
It's so tiny!

1899
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,740
Oh my god!

1900
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,520
Wait, I just realized I'm not wearing my dragoon hoodie.

1901
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,900
Ha ha ha ha!

1902
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,680
I'm talking about...

1903
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,240
There you go.

1904
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:50,260
Aww!

1905
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:52,980
That's cute!

1906
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,500
Aww!

1907
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:54,600
Aww!

1908
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,560
And then there's the whole gang!

1909
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,040
It's step one!

1910
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,200
Get a cake!

1911
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,300
Step two!

1912
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,340
Decorate!

1913
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:02,640
Ha ha ha ha!

1914
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,340
Ha ha ha ha!

1915
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:03,840
Ha ha ha ha!

1916
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,900
It's like, you know those tutorials where they're like, um, how to draw your favorite character.

1917
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,060
Step one!

1918
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,020
Draw a circle!

1919
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:11,800
Step two!

1920
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:12,480
It's done!

1921
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:13,380
It's...

1922
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,580
Ha ha ha ha!

1923
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,500
Ha ha ha ha!

1924
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:16,880
Ha ha ha!

1925
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,200
Ha ha ha!

1926
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,600
Ha ha ha!

1927
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,180
Ha ha ha!

1928
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,120
But thank you everyone!

1929
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,000

1931
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,680
Um...

1932
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,200
For the Akasupas!

1933
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,620
For the Super Chats in general!

1934
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,000
And for all the members!

1935
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,400

1936
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,120
Thank you everybody!

1937
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,740
It means so much that you're all here to celebrate my birthday with me!

1938
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,200
Thank you guys!

1939
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,980
Ha ha ha ha!

1940
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:41,860
Ha ha ha!

1941
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:42,020

1942
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,320
Draw two circles!

1943
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,460
Draw the rest of the owl!

1944
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,260
Yes!

1945
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,640
Ha ha ha ha!

1946
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,800
That's usually how it goes, right?

1947
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,960
Ha ha ha ha!

1948
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:53,640
Ha ha ha!

1949
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:53,940
Ha ha ha!

1950
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,160
Um...

1951
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:55,540
Oh yes!

1952
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,140
Uh...

1953
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,120
Let me see it.

1954
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:00,340
I have like a whole folder of like, remember to show these things!

1955
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,120
Toki!

1956
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,020
I remember to show it!

1957
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:03,720
Uh...

1958
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,100
Oh yes!

1959
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:04,780
By the way!

1960
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,560
Here is...

1961
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:07,800
Uh...

1962
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:11,260
So if you guys didn't know, here is the 3D models.

1963
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,220
Uh...

1964
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,260
Of the costumes.

1965
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,500
Of the school outfits.

1966
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,520
Uh...

1967
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,460
Done by...

1968
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,000
Salted Fish.

1969
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:17,440
Uh...

1970
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:17,840
So...

1971
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,140
Obviously for our...

1972
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,220
Isekai...

1973
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:20,860
Um...

1974
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,720
Isekai video.

1975
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,480
Uh...

1976
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:22,780
Oh yeah!

1977
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,320
So...

1978
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,500
That was my idea.

1979
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,320
Cause I was like...

1980
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:25,900
Okay, how...

1981
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:26,360
I like how...

1982
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,480
I like doing these like little mini-series, you know?

1983
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,880
Where like...

1984
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,060
There's like, you know...

1985
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,500
A story behind every outfit reveal.

1986
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,800
So it's not just like...

1987
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,780
Here's my outfit.

1988
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,560
Like...

1989
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,000
I...

1990
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:39,940
I...

1991
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:40,000
I...

1992
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,180
But...

1993
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,700
Like I said from the summer one.

1994
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,480
Um...

1995
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,120
I always love doing like a little...

1996
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:44,640
Little story.

1997
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,740
That goes between...

1998
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,060
Each outfit reveal.

1999
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:48,300
And...

2000
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,180
Okay, this one was a little scuffed.

2001
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,080
Cause I didn't know how to end.

2002
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:51,420
I...

2003
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,840
I felt like this could go on forever.

2004
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,040
So I had to like...

2005
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:54,900
Stop the...

2006
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,600
Immersion.

2007
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,200
And be like...

2008
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,660
Okay, I have a lot of stuff to go through.

2009
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,040
Like...

2010
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:58,840
I can't...

2011
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,020
I can't continue this story...

2012
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,660
Anymore.

2013
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:02,800
I...

2014
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,720
There's...

2015
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,160
You know, in the past I would...

2016
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:06,580
It would...

2017
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,080
The story would continue.

2018
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,840
But I literally couldn't...

2019
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,040
I...

2020
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,600
I had so much stuff to talk to you guys about.

2021
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,160
So I was just like...

2022
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,160
Alright, we're stopping here.

2023
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:15,800
We're...

2024
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,720
To continue this...

2025
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,080
To continue this...

2026
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,440
This scenario...

2027
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,740
You have to buy...

2028
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,220
The DLC.

2029
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,320
I'm sorry.

2030
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,360
You've used up your credits by the way...

2031
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:31,860
Dragoons.

2032
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:32,700
You...

2033
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,400
You've used up...

2034
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,600
Your credits...

2035
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:35,980
For...

2036
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,140
For the school...

2037
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:37,860
School...

2038
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:38,540
Scenario.

2039
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:44,140
Um...

2040
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,540
And the DLC...

2041
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,240
Noooo!

2042
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,140
Uh...

2043
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:48,800
But...

2044
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,440
Yeah...

2045
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,040
Uh...

2046
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:50,900
So...

2047
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:51,440
It was...

2048
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:51,880
I had...

2049
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,520
The idea...

2050
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,500
Okay, so...

2051
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,580
At first...

2052
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,500
I need you guys to know...

2053
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,060
For...

2054
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,320
The video...

2055
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,000
The funny thing about the video...

2056
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,840
Was that...

2057
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,380
Um...

2058
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:00,940
It didn't...

2059
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:01,880
At first it was just...

2060
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,460
A regular tomato...

2061
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:04,520
And then I was like...

2062
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,500
Oh, can we make...

2063
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,860
The tomato...

2064
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,320
More...

2065
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,140
God-like?

2066
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,200
And then...

2067
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,200
The...

2068
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,220
Animator...

2069
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:11,820
The video...

2070
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,580
MB guy was like...

2071
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,360
Um...

2072
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,680
The video guy was like...

2073
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,440
How do you...

2074
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,380
What do you mean by that?

2075
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,600
And then I drew this...

2076
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,160
That...

2077
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:19,380
This...

2078
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:21,220
I...

2079
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:22,580
I...

2080
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,720
I drew this...

2081
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,040
Uh...

2082
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,840
This is my reference...

2083
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,660
To the...

2084
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:28,320
To the...

2085
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,380
To the...

2086
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,100
Video editor...

2087
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:30,620
I was like...

2088
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,960
Can you make the tomato look like this?

2089
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,160
As if he's like...

2090
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,380
A fucking god...

2091
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,740
Or some shit...

2092
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,620
I drew this in MSB with my mouse...

2093
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:39,980
I...

2094
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:43,840
The...

2095
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,120
Perfection...

2096
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,380
Witness him...

2097
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:49,980
Um...

2098
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:50,780
But...

2099
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,700
Um...

2100
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:51,920
But...

2101
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,000
But yeah...

2102
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,240
That's basically...

2103
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:53,620
Uh...

2104
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,060
Also...

2105
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:54,560
Let me...

2106
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,880
Put my ad...

2107
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,020
Buy my merch...

2108
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,120
Here's my...

2109
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,380
Here's my ad...

2110
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,040
By the way...

2111
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,800
Time for an...

2112
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,660
Time for an ad break...

2113
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,280
You can't skip this ad...

2114
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:05,660
You...

2115
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,320
You...

2116
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:10,720
Um...

2117
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:14,800
Um...

2118
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:14,960
But...

2119
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,280
But...

2120
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:15,580
Yeah...

2121
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,340
Anyway...

2122
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:16,720
Uh...

2123
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,100
Can we have that as the wall...

2124
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:19,500
Baby!

2125
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,060
Uh...

2126
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,020
But yes...

2127
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,700
I am super...

2128
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:27,620
Um...

2129
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,380
Super...

2130
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,680
Happy to spend...

2131
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:29,940
Uh...

2132
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,140
My birthday with...

2133
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,520
My dragoons...

2134
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,380
As always...

2135
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:34,980
Because you guys always...

2136
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:35,620
Uh...

2137
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,600
Make me feel so happy...

2138
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,100
Um...

2139
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:38,700
Every day.

2140
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:43,220
And, you know, happy being able to celebrate my special day with all of you guys!

2141
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:43,960
Yay!

2142
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,380
Who's the artist?

2143
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,060
Oh my gosh.

2144
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,640
I'll have them pull up the artists.

2145
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,600
Because, like, they...

2146
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:58,260
The team knew how I was super busy, so they didn't want to bother me while I was prepping for the streams for today.

2147
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,400
And so I'll be giving them the list of all the artists.

2148
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,020
Because I was the one that contacted all the artists.

2149
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:14,420
So my team, the Gamersupps team, and my staff team that was in charge of the website, don't really know which artists I...

2150
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:21,700
Which artists I contacted to make all the illustrations for the merch.

2151
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,020
So I'll be giving them a list later.

2152
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:26,640
They didn't want to bother me because I was, you know, I've been working since 10 in the morning.

2153
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,040
But you guys might be like, Wait, 10 in the morning?

2154
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,680
What have you been planning?

2155
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,780
Jokey, why did it take you guys that long?

2156
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,340
All right.

2157
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:42,140
Um, there's one thing I didn't show you guys.

2158
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,560
And it's this little gift right here.

2159
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,420
So, I think it's time for the announcement.

2160
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,420
Oh wait, before... JK.

2161
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,660
It's actually green screen time.

2162
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,940
Get baited.

2163
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,460
I showed you the present.

2164
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,420
And now, now you gotta wait after the green screen.

2165
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,380
What's in the box, Jokey?

2166
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,680
Also, we gotta figure out the colors, guys.

2167
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:19,660
Again.

2168
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,580
Okay, so...

2169
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,320
Oh, that is really green.

2170
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,700
What do we be?

2171
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:25,800
Do we be purple?

2172
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,380
No, but then there's my hair clip.

2173
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,520
Guys, I have too many colors.

2174
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,180
What color do we be?

2175
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,220
Maybe like...

2176
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:34,820
Dark blue?

2177
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,640
Wait, what color can we be, guys?

2178
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,600
My eyes.

2179
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,400
The not green screen.

2180
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:48,240
I don't know what color to be because there's so many colors.

2181
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,280
I have too many colors on me.

2182
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,580
Oh, dark purple?

2183
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,920
Wait, we could be dark purple.

2184
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:55,560
Let's see.

2185
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:56,640
Maybe gray?

2186
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,600
Wait, okay.

2187
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,100
Let's try dark purple.

2188
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,120
Okay, how do I...

2189
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:02,280
Okay.

2190
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,080
Let's try...

2191
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,620
Let's try...

2192
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:07,420
Um...

2193
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,060
Okay, here we go.

2194
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,200
Do you think that works?

2195
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:12,540
Dark purple?

2196
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:14,920
How about this purple?

2197
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,220
You think that purple works?

2198
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,960
Oh, but then my phone, though.

2199
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,060
What about...

2200
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,580
Yeah, my phone and my nails.

2201
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,580
That's what I'm saying!

2202
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,700
I have too many colors!

2203
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,180
Oh, dark blue.

2204
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:29,960
Oh, does this...

2205
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,540
No, because...

2206
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,500
What about my sweater?

2207
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,040
What about my sweater, though?

2208
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,020
What about this one?

2209
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,600
Dark...

2210
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,500
Dark green!

2211
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,180
You're so right!

2212
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,000
Okay, let's...

2213
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,540
Get dark green.

2214
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,760
Okay, uh...

2215
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,500
There you go.

2216
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,300
Do you think this works?

2217
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,760
This should work, right?

2218
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,120
Maybe this?

2219
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,720
Do you think this will work?

2220
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,160
The dark green screen?

2221
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,280
Literally green.

2222
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:00,840
Yeah, but my eyes!

2223
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,620
My eyes are, like, light green.

2224
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,700
Or should we do it?

2225
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:08,560
Okay.

2226
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:09,660
Darker?

2227
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:10,100
Okay.

2228
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,320
That's as dark as we can go.

2229
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,180
Here you go.

2230
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:16,980
Do you think that works?

2231
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:17,400
Okay.

2232
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,080
All right!

2233
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:19,960
All right, let me do...

2234
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,860
Let me...

2235
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,300
Okay, we should have some music.

2236
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,910
All right, so there's me.

2237
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,990
Fold me.

2238
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,350
And then...

2239
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,610
The tomato.

2240
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:39,550
Yeah!

2241
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,310
And then...

2242
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:43,810
Eh!

2243
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:49,170
And...

2244
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,110
Me holding dad.

2245
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,630
I like holding dad without the hoodie, though.

2246
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,320
I feel like...

2247
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:54,410
Hey!

2248
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:55,090
Hey, look!

2249
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:55,670
There he is!

2250
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:56,610
Mr. Class President!

2251
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:57,750
There he is!

2252
01:18:58,230 --> 01:18:58,690
Uh...

2253
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,390
He's not taking any questions!

2254
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:05,090
He's not taking any questions!

2255
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:08,570
Also, my food has been, like, outside my door for, like, the last hour.

2256
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:09,950
All right, look at...

2257
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:10,330
Okay, wait.

2258
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:14,010
Here, you guys, look at dad for a sec while I get my food.

2259
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:14,990
I'll be right back.

2260
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:02,410
All right.

2261
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,630
It took a while because, um...

2262
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,870
Because I had to, like...

2263
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:09,270
You know when they tie a really tight knot on the bag?

2264
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:10,210
So I had to...

2265
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,250
I had to...

2266
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,210
Like, I was trying to...

2267
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:13,650
I was trying to tie the knot.

2268
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:15,230
I was like, I just clipped my nails!

2269
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:16,530
I can't do this!

2270
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:17,090
Okay.

2271
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:19,090
Okay.

2272
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,070
All right.

2273
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:20,710
Anyway.

2274
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:23,430
Here's...

2275
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,350
Wait, wait, let me see.

2276
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:26,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2277
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:39,710
What are you looking at, huh?

2278
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:49,890
All right.

2279
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:50,710
How is that?

2280
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,870
It's not that I like you or anything.

2281
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,390
I'm a bugger.

2282
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,710
I'm fucking cringy!

2283
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:01,490
I could never roleplay.

2284
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:02,050
All right.

2285
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:04,730
I can't take myself seriously.

2286
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:12,090
Now I eat.

2287
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:19,610
I eat now.

2288
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,410
Um, what else?

2289
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:29,810
Oh, he knows I'm eating.

2290
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:34,290
Mr. President, I'm sorry for eating.

2291
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,030
Class president, I'm sorry for eating.

2292
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:40,730
I'm outside at lunch hours, but I'm so hungry.

2293
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,490
Okay, um, what else?

2294
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,690
Oh, yeah, a tomato.

2295
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:55,050
There's such an ugly fucking color, the green screen.

2296
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,010
I'm just, there's too many colors.

2297
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:01,250
I have, I have too many colors.

2298
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:06,070
The green screen is so ugly compared to the screenshots.

2299
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,930
No food in the classroom.

2300
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,730
I'm sorry, Mr. Class president.

2301
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:21,010
Oh, yeah, and then, um,

2302
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:31,070
what?

2303
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:32,530
Okay, now I do request.

2304
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:35,590
Um, I'm doing requests now.

2305
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,590
What do you guys want to see?

2306
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:37,750
Guys.

2307
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:39,850
Hmm?

2308
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:43,700
Hmm.

2309
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,050
What expressions do you guys want to see, guys?

2310
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:51,610
While I eat my food.

2311
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:03,850
Okay, the only way I'll ever...

2312
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:07,750
I'll do the Jesus combo is if Jesus shows up.

2313
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:13,030
On the third day, he shall rise.

2314
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:16,010
So, whenever he shows...

2315
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,330
If he shows up, I'll give you the combo.

2316
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:24,430
Only if he shows up, though.

2317
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:26,210
Um, I need...

2318
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:29,190
That is only given to Jesus.

2319
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:32,670
Where is he when we need him the most?

2320
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:39,110
Where is he?

2321
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,370
And the...

2322
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:41,390
Oh, and the lollipop?

2323
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:42,190
Sure.

2324
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:43,670
Ha ha ha ha.

2325
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:45,590
Jesus, don't go.

2326
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:46,910
Ha ha ha ha.

2327
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,190
Praise the Lord.

2328
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:52,990
Guys, I don't think Jesus is here, guys.

2329
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:55,050
I don't think he's here.

2330
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:55,970
Ha ha ha.

2331
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:57,730
Ha ha ha.

2332
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,270
Um, all right.

2333
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,550
We got the glasses.

2334
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,590
All right, glasses done.

2335
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,270
All right, what other...

2336
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,850
I'll do five requests.

2337
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:11,690
That's request number one.

2338
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,590
What's request number two?

2339
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:14,970
I've lost faith.

2340
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:16,910
Ha ha ha ha.

2341
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:22,910
He has disappointed me for the last time.

2342
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,190
The face?

2343
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:24,550
Okay.

2344
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:25,650
Um.

2345
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,330
Uh.

2346
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:30,030
I mean, that's not you.

2347
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:31,770
I know what...

2348
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:32,710
Ha ha ha.

2349
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,590
Identity stuff is not a joke, guys.

2350
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,390
I...

2351
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:37,010
Ha ha ha.

2352
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:41,150
Yeah, I can do that.

2353
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:43,510
Ha ha ha.

2354
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:46,930
Ha ha ha.

2355
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:48,610
Ha ha ha.

2356
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,250
Wait, let me...

2357
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,190
Where am I hoodie?

2358
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,380
Ha ha ha ha.

2359
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,200
Ha ha ha.

2360
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:57,440
Ha ha ha.

2361
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:58,480
Ha ha ha.

2362
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,400
That is not...

2363
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,120
That is not Jesus.

2364
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,020
You can't fool me.

2365
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,500
I shall make Jesus request in this place.

2366
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,580
No, it has to be from specifically Jesus.

2367
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,000
It can't be...

2368
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,820
No imposters.

2369
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:17,200
We can't have...

2370
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,840
We can't have any imposters of the Messiah.

2371
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:21,340
Ha ha ha ha.

2372
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,400
Ha ha ha.

2373
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,260
Ha ha ha.

2374
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:24,740
Ha ha ha.

2375
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:24,980
Ha ha ha.

2376
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,140
We are not here for heretics.

2377
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,140
Ha ha ha.

2378
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:29,400
Ha ha ha.

2379
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:29,780
All right, whatever.

2380
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,260
Okay, that's request number two.

2381
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:32,440
Ha ha ha.

2382
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:33,020
Ha ha ha.

2383
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,700
What's request...

2384
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,820
I know what Jesus' profile picture looks like.

2385
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,800
All right, what's request number three?

2386
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:44,870
Yeah, I don't accept the false prophet.

2387
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:45,650
I need...

2388
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:47,230
I need the real deal.

2389
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:50,150
Uh, we have Jesus at home.

2390
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:51,170
Ha ha ha.

2391
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:51,730
All right.

2392
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:53,870
All right, let's see.

2393
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:54,550
Long neck.

2394
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:55,670
Ah.

2395
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,370
Ha ha ha ha.

2396
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:00,150
Ah.

2397
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:02,110
Ha ha ha.

2398
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,730
Ha ha ha.

2399
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,390
Do not be afraid.

2400
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,870
Ha ha ha.

2401
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:08,950
All right.

2402
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:10,750
The false idols.

2403
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,310
And then...

2404
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:16,510
Oh my God, I'm so tired.

2405
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,710
I'm so...

2406
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:19,710
I'm so tired.

2407
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:20,530
Guys.

2408
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,830
I'm so...

2409
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,130
I'm so tired.

2410
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:26,870
Dragons.

2411
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:28,810
I was up all night.

2412
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:31,570
Cramming for the final.

2413
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:33,170
I'm so tired.

2414
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:35,710
Sorry, he knows I'm eating.

2415
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:37,130
Ha ha ha.

2416
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:39,530
Oh, no, kitty?

2417
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:40,470
I got you.

2418
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:43,930
I'm so tired.

2419
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:47,830
Actually, me though.

2420
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:50,030
Actually, me right now.

2421
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:51,690
I'm so fucking tired.

2422
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:57,730
Okay.

2423
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:03,070
Om nom nom nom nom.

2424
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:08,170
Om nom nom.

2425
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:09,750
Mmm.

2426
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:12,450
Okay.

2427
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,520
Alright, what else do you guys want?

2428
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,040
The dark circles...

2429
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:21,780
The dark circles, guys!

2430
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,800
Oh, it's too real!

2431
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,020
The dark circles are too real!

2432
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,220
It's giving you guys PTSD!

2433
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,020
Alright, last request.

2434
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:48,620
Last request, guys.

2435
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,680
Before I give you guys the announcement.

2436
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,640
Uh, for his commentary!

2437
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,980
Is that right?

2438
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,340
Is that right, Dad?

2439
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,200
You wanna give some commentary?

2440
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,260
Alright.

2441
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,580
Uh...

2442
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:06,140
Can you do the combo off screen?

2443
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,140
Ha ha ha!

2444
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,640
Ha ha ha!

2445
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,960
Whenever Jesus...

2446
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,080
If Jesus ever shows up again, Uh, you'll...

2447
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:14,460
You'll...

2448
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,060
You'll get your combo.

2449
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:15,660
But not...

2450
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,880
If he doesn't, not today.

2451
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,720
I'll give the combo whenever he shows up.

2452
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:20,740
Oh, Dizzy.

2453
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:21,540
I'll do...

2454
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,040
What is it?

2455
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,680
Last combo.

2456
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,300
Ha ha ha ha!

2457
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:36,750
Ha ha ha ha!

2458
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:37,550
There you go.

2459
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:38,490
Alright.

2460
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:41,230
Now it's announcement time.

2461
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,090
Alright.

2462
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:44,730
Can I get a drum roll, please?

2463
01:29:45,510 --> 01:30:13,670
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba You know,

2464
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:19,790
it's like a re-gift to, like, people who got something they didn't want, and then they re-gift it to, like, somebody's birthday or some shit.

2465
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:27,170
They got a really shitty Christmas present, and then they re-gift it to something, to, uh, with the same, using the same box and everything.

2466
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:38,990
Alright, I have to eat.

2467
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:41,590
I also remembered that I'm still confused.

2468
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:42,230
Alright!

2469
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:46,950
There it is.

2470
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:49,950
Duh.

2471
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:55,390
The surprise gift slash announcement.

2472
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:57,070
Whoa!

2473
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:00,410
Whoa!

2474
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,390
Oh, and I can put it back on.

2475
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:03,450
And then, whoa!

2476
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:06,230
And then it's back on.

2477
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:11,770
What is it, Toki?

2478
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,910
What's in the box?

2479
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:15,010
All right.

2480
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:17,950
Whoa.

2481
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:18,830
Whoa.

2482
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:19,490
Whoa.

2483
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:20,410
Whoa.

2484
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,090
What could it be?

2485
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:29,910
What's this?

2486
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:32,150
That's the concert!

2487
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:32,750
Yes!

2488
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:35,970
But what do you mean by, by this, Toki?

2489
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:43,310
I believe, in 30 minutes, I will be giving you guys a little birthday treat.

2490
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:50,810
And I will be re-streaming the concert version, the Anime Expo version, one time.

2491
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:52,890
One time.

2492
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:58,250
And then after that one time, it will be privated until the polished version comes out.

2493
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:08,910
Um, I decided to treat you guys in this, um, in this, but it will only be shown once, before it's fixed.

2494
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,490
Before we, before we fix it.

2495
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:22,130
So I do have, I do have, I do have rules though for this.

2496
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:27,310
Um, it will be, okay let me, actually I made a waiting room for it already.

2497
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:29,410
So let me make, make the waiting room.

2498
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,590
I'm going to make the waiting room un-private now.

2499
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:37,530
But in 30 minutes at 7 p.m.

2500
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:46,130
PST, this concert will be shown once on stream before it gets privated.

2501
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:50,550
And then we'll have an after-party concert where the true birthday celebration.

2502
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:57,710
So today was actually a three-parter.

2503
01:32:57,710 --> 01:33:00,670
So there's more stuff on the third... there's three streams.

2504
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:07,090
So the third stream, I'll go into depth about this concert.

2505
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:10,870
And I'll be showing behind-the-scenes videos of this concert.

2506
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:14,510
So let me un-private this right now.

2507
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:15,690
Boop!

2508
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:22,030
So these are my... these are my guidelines for this concert.

2509
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:31,270
No full recordings or read the uploads of any sections of it on YouTube.

2510
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:39,630
So as I will be uploading a full polished version with new songs and fixed elements to it.

2511
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,290
Because it was done within a month, so there's some like rushed aspects to it.

2512
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:47,190
So that's why I don't want... I don't really want that to be the archived version.

2513
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:51,250
But because it's my birthday, I decided to treat you guys for this.

2514
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:58,210
The existing uploads of the venue version at Anime Expo is okay to keep up.

2515
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:06,510
You can post small clips and GIFs and pictures on any social... on social media.

2516
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:07,950
So you can do that for social media.

2517
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:12,550
If you want to put small clips, GIFs, or pictures and screenshots, you can.

2518
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:18,910
Just no full recordings or upload... or re-uploads of any sections on YouTube.

2519
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:20,150
That's all I ask.

2520
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:25,150
And this will be privated right after the concert is over.

2521
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:29,030
Um, as I want the polished version to be the archive.

2522
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:33,210
But yeah, like I said, I decided to give you guys like a little birthday treat of this version.

2523
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:34,670
Um...

2524
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,190
So yes, let me link the...

2525
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:38,330
I'll link the waiting room right now.

2526
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:40,610
Uh...

2527
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:41,870
For you guys.

2528
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:43,770
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

2529
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:45,610
Here is...

2530
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:49,210
This is the waiting room for, uh...

2531
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:51,050
For the concert version.

2532
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:53,290
Um...

2533
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:53,850
But yes!

2534
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:55,390
Um...

2535
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:59,190
I'm sorry to the gragoons who are not awake to watch this version.

2536
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,070
But do not worry!

2537
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:01,810
We will have...

2538
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:02,870
Uh...

2539
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:05,810
We will have a polished version at a later date.

2540
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:07,950
And it will be a bigger improvement.

2541
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,850
Because like I said...

2542
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:10,270
Um...

2543
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:10,990
This...

2544
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:12,810
Was rushed up...

2545
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:13,770
This was done in a month.

2546
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:14,930
I won't say like rushed rush.

2547
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:15,970
But...

2548
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:16,310
Um...

2549
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,670
It could be a lot better.

2550
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:19,130
And I am a professionist.

2551
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,610
And I do want...

2552
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:23,410
The version that will be archived...

2553
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:24,930
To be the one...

2554
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:26,570
That's like...

2555
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:26,910
You know...

2556
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:27,870
To my standard.

2557
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,990
In a way where like...

2558
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:29,470
I want...

2559
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:31,170
Like there's like little mistakes here and there.

2560
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,210
And that's why I was like hesitant about uploading...

2561
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:35,050
This version.

2562
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:37,030
Because I know people are gonna like...

2563
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:39,030
Be like nitpicky over it.

2564
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:39,590
So...

2565
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,870
So that's why...

2566
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:42,890
Um...

2567
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,130
That's why I was like...

2568
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:44,390
I...

2569
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,510
I was like a little...

2570
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:48,610
Hesitant in like showing you guys...

2571
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,250
This version.

2572
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:51,650
Because when you see the HD version of it...

2573
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:52,010
You'll...

2574
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:52,830
Like...

2575
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:53,490
For me...

2576
01:35:53,970 --> 01:35:55,210
I'm like a perfectionist.

2577
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:55,770
So like...

2578
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:56,390
I was like...

2579
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,070
Aw man...

2580
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:58,550
I wish this was changed.

2581
01:35:58,670 --> 01:35:59,550
Or that was changed.

2582
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:00,470
Or like...

2583
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:02,230
This was brushed up on or fixed.

2584
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:03,010
But...

2585
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:04,190
I do...

2586
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:04,910
Um...

2587
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:05,310
I...

2588
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,030
I decided...

2589
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:06,530
You know like...

2590
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:06,910
Fuck it.

2591
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:07,890
Um...

2592
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:09,790
I do want you guys...

2593
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:10,270
Uh...

2594
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:11,890
For those who weren't there...

2595
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:12,230
You know...

2596
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,010
In America...

2597
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:13,790
To be able to see this.

2598
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:14,730
Um...

2599
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:16,210
I decided to be...

2600
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:17,350
To show you guys...

2601
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,610
Uh...

2602
01:36:17,610 --> 01:36:19,070
To give you guys the opportunity...

2603
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:20,150
To see...

2604
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:20,810
Um...

2605
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,350
The concert version of this.

2606
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:23,430
But only once.

2607
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:27,570
You get to watch the rare...

2608
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:28,310
Raw...

2609
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:29,450
Unedited version today.

2610
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:31,370
And this will be in...

2611
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:32,290
30 minutes.

2612
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:33,510
Um...

2613
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:34,230
But I will be uploading...

2614
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:35,470
A director's cut...

2615
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:35,790
Slash...

2616
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:36,730
Polished version later.

2617
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:38,410
Oh...

2618
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:40,270
Um...

2619
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:41,510
But yes...

2620
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:44,730
Um...

2621
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:46,810
Because of it...

2622
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:47,750
There is a third stream.

2623
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:49,490
Which is the...

2624
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:50,070
After party.

2625
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:50,850
So let me...

2626
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:51,850
I forgot to...

2627
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:53,130
Unprivate that one too.

2628
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:56,330
And that's where we...

2629
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:57,130
Actually can chill.

2630
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,330
That's what I was like saying.

2631
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:59,370
I had to like...

2632
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:03,070
I didn't prolong the outfit reveal part.

2633
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,410
Because there's so much to do.

2634
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:06,710
There's so much to do.

2635
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:07,350
Today.

2636
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:09,470
So I didn't prolong...

2637
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,490
The outfit reveal.

2638
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:11,150
Cause I want...

2639
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:12,110
There's so many things...

2640
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,290
I wanted to like...

2641
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:13,830

And everything.

2645
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:23,530
So I try to, like, make sure that, you know, I get to say everything before it's too late for everyone.

2646
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,010
Before, like, it gets too late.

2647
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:29,170
But, alright, so...

2648
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:31,930
So the after-party is out as well!

2649
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:32,390

2651
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:40,430

But I'll split... I wanna go in-depth for the credits later.

2665
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:32,170
Oh my gosh, I forgot to do... Oh, this is... I knew I forgot something.

2666
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:34,390
I forgot to put, like, an outline.

2667
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,270
This is a little hard to see.

2668
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:40,030
Alright, I'll show this on part three.

2669
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:42,250

2670
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:50,470
If you guys wanna see the credits of everything, I will show that on part three of the stream.

2671
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:57,070
Anyway guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2672
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:59,890
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2673
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:00,890
Oh wait, no, don't head to bed.

2674
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:02,310
Go to the concert stream.
