1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:26,620
In the light of the day, in the dark of the night, When you're raring to go, when you're tired from the fight, When you're losing your mind, let me give you a thought, I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what.

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:44,520
In the dark of the night, in the light of the day, When you're rising to shine, when you're hitting the hay, I'll be hanging around, if you like it or not, I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what.

3
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,740
No matter what.

4
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,900
No matter what.

5
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,000
No matter what.

6
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,000
No matter what.

7
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,100
No matter what.

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,280
No matter what.

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,300
No matter what.

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:10,740
No matter what.

11
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:38,780
In the dark of the night, in the light of the day, When you're rising to shine, when you're hitting the hay, Just remember this song.

12
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
How's it go?

13
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,620
I forgot!

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,500
I'm gonna be right by your side, no matter what.

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,340
Through whoever you've been, through whoever you'll be, Through whatever you lose, you will always have me.

16
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,140
At the end of your road, I'll be holding you tight.

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,380
I'm gonna be right by your side, no matter what.

18
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:15,400
Be right by your side, be right by your side, Be right by your side, no matter what.
