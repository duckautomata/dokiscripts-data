00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,140
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,440
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,660
Oh my gosh, I just noticed the main screen, like...

4
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,780
I just noticed it.

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,700
Oh my god, why is my chat always dead?

6
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,360
Every time I swap, guys, the loop is starting.

7
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,360
The bark...

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,180
The negative bark loop feedback is starting already.

9
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Um, okay.

10
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,320
He knows I'm streaming, so he's not barking right now.

11
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:13,760
Thank god.

12
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:21,260
He has... that DrakeyAmberDoge has, like, learned, like, when I'm streaming and that means do not disturb me.

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,800
Do not- Today is not the right time right now.

14
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,180
Chikorii, thank you for the super chat!

15
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,140
Thank you, thank you!

16
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,380
What's that, DokiBeard?

17
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,920
Are you starving?

18
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,880
Yeah, I'm hungry, too.

19
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,540
Consuming my food menu, by the way.

20
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,580
Thank you for the super chat!

21
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,300
Thank you, thank you.

22
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,040
Yeah, today I, like, ordered- today I, um...

23
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,600
I, uh, I didn't eat lunch yet.

24
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:55,180
Um, well, it's technically gonna be dinner soon, too, because I was, you know, like I said, yesterday, uh, okay, you might hear the dog- you might hear the Toy Poodle barking in the background because I can't stop her, obviously, like, she's not my dog.

25
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,560
But, like, when I- you guys caught the last stream, um, I was so tired for some reason, like, yesterday I was so fucking tired.

26
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,900
I, like, took multiple naps yesterday and, like, um, I was supposed to get some work done and I was like, I'm gonna sleep.

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,140
I'm gonna fucking sleep and take a nap, take, like, a three-hour nap, and I ended up waking up at, like, 11 a.m.

28
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,740
And I was like, oh fuck, like, because I was like, that was so much to do!

29
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,070
Um, but after this stream, I still have a lot to do.

30
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:38,790
So, like, basically, I got up, I had to go straight to work because- and then, like, for some reason my Apex settings reset itself, so I had to take some time to fix my Apex settings.

31
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,170
I got almost everything except for Taco Aim.

32
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,310
Taco Aim was the only thing I wasn't able to, like, fix and I had to fix it during the game.

33
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,290
So, um, and my Apex settings reset itself, so I had to do and fix that.

34
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:59,110
And then I had to, like, upload my waiting room because I forgot I was gonna upload it after my nap, but my nap ended up being at 11 a.m.

35
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,810
So I ended up not uploading it.

36
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,470
So I ended up uploading my waiting room, um, super last minute, you know, like an hour before the tournament was supposed to start.

37
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:22,850
And then the thing is, like, and then I had, like, other work stuff to do, so I had to do, like, I was supposed to upload my Fortnite video today, but then, like, I didn't realize, and I think my manager didn't realize, but we had no thumbnail for that video.

38
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,030
Because my manager was like, all right, make sure you upload the video, like, at four.

39
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,470
And I was like, yeah, of course.

40
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:37,730
Um, but like, uh, I was gonna, I was uploading it after the tournament and I was like, wait, I have no thumbnail for this.

41
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,150
Like, we have everything done but a thumbnail.

42
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,570
Like, and then, um, and so then I was like, sorry, that's the toy poodle.

43
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,630
So then I was like, oh, what the fuck do I do?

44
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,250
I was like, oh, well, my manager's asleep.

45
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,390
So I was like, I have no thumbnail.

46
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,070
What do I do?

47
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,950
So, like, it's not my fault.

48
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,450
I literally have no thumbnail.

49
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,070
Like, I don't know what to do.

50
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,130
So, like, I messaged, like, one of our editors and was like, can you make a clickbait thumbnail?

51
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,770
Like, um, so we're gonna see, like, we're gonna see how that goes.

52
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,630
Uh, so they said they can get to me, um, in, like, a bit.

53
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:28,650
Um, but yeah, and then after, and then the Fortnite thing and then, you know, we had, oh my god, that custom was so it was, oh my god, it was such a mess.

54
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:28,910
Like,

55
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,010
I think they, I think they just used, like, public apex lobbies and stuff.

56
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,790
It was rough.

57
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:46,950
It was so, I think, like, for me, my vibes were, like, it kept getting, like, you know how, like, you're trying to keep, like, the same vibe throughout?

58
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:53,930
It was so hard to keep the same vibe when, like, you know, it, there were always interruptions and everything.

59
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,470
So I was just, like, like, like, it threw off my vibe.

60
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,330
Like, it kept throwing it off.

61
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:08,250
It didn't help that I DC'd too, like, yeah, I feel a lot better about my, my custom.

62
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,390
I was talking to, like, one of my friends about it who participated.

63
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,350
Uh, well, they didn't participate in this one.

64
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,270
Um, but they were saying that, like, oh, yeah, no, you're, there was no issues with your custom.

65
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:34,150
But this one, there was, like, I, they were, like, yeah, we heard, like, a lot of people were complaining about it because, like, it was, um, it was, like, um, people were complaining about it because, you know, it was, there was, like, so much, like,

66
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,710
stuff.

67
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,150
I think it's the rules.

68
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:51,550
I think, because, like, I knew that, like, um, when you have, like, legend lock rules, when you have rules that were, like, based off of, like, lot, like, you gotta pick specific legends, someone's gonna fuck it up.

69
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,970
Like, because there's, there's 60 people.

70
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,290
There's 60 people and, like, um, you do not expect them to read the rules.

71
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:14,530
Like, so, the fact that we had to restart every game, every fucking game because at least one team just forgot to pick the legend because we don't know when it's gonna start, too.

72
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,670
That's the thing.

73
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,230
That's the thing.

74
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,990
So, like, yeah, my vibes were, like, so thrown off when we had to restart, like, every fucking game.

75
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,650
We also got really unlucky in some games.

76
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,190
Like, you know, my, me DCing and, uh, I still had fun.

77
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,830
I just wish that, like, I just wish it didn't, like, I wish, like, we didn't have to restart every match, too.

78
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:47,710
Uh, that's the only thing, like, that, like, uh, bothered me, that we have to restart every game.

79
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,050
And then when you're restarting a game, you have to wait in between restarting, too.

80
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,910
So that was, like, super annoying for me.

81
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,670
And I usually don't get annoyed very much when it comes to, like, stuff like this.

82
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,730
But, like, when it was, like, every fucking game, I was like, oh my god.

83
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,270
Oh, put me out of my misery.

84
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,690
I heard the custom had, um, uh, yeah, it ruined the pacing.

85
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:32,310
The custom had a lot of issues that came up, especially getting, like, participants and stuff, because, like, each team was supposed to have one content creator, one pro, and one VTuber, but some teams ended up having, like, two V, like, two pros and stuff and everything.

86
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,790
So, like, the balancing was, like, super off in general, uh, because of it.

87
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,290
Um, even though it was, like, at first they were like, oh, yeah, like, this is gonna be how the balancing goes.

88
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,110
Um, was there one team?

89
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:49,010
I think there was one team with two pros and a, um, and a challenger circuit player.

90
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,570
Uh, I know, like, one team had, like, two pros and challenger circuit.

91
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,950
So it was just, like, it was just weird balancing in general.

92
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,270
Um, which is, like, like, I've had issues with that, too.

93
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,270
Balancing is very, very hard, um, and everything.

94
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,850
So, like, I get that.

95
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,770
I get that, though.

96
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,490
Like, I get, like, uh, how hard it is to do balancing and stuff.

97
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:17,570
And a lot of people were, like, dropping last minute to, uh, dropping out, um, at last minute.

98
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,130
Because I know there was, like, teams that literally got a replacement.

99
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,710
Teams that had replacements given to them.

100
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,550
Um, five minutes after it was supposed to start.

101
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,170
Like, you know, like, the customer was supposed to start at 1 p.m.

102
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,110
And then, like, they had a replacement given to them, like, at 1.05.

103
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,390
So, um, so, like, it was, like, super fucking rough for some, um, people.

104
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,130
So, yeah.

105
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:53,530
Yeah, because, like, um, because, like, I know, like, the custom itself wasn't, like, officially.

106
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,990
By the way, I found out I wasn't even supposed to announce I was gonna be part of this custom.

107
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:06,950
Like, we were supposed to, uh, we were supposed to, like, wait until an official announcement came out and then we talk about it.

108
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,030
I didn't know that because I didn't pay it.

109
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,770
I didn't, like, there was no paying for it.

110
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,370
Um, but somebody, I realized somebody asked about it.

111
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,750
Please hold off until we make an official announcement, but then the official announcement was today.

112
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,410
I wasn't gonna...

113
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,230
I was gonna... I wasn't gonna wait until today to post my schedule.

114
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:25,850
Like,

115
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,290
the official announcement was today.

116
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,890
Like, I can't wait until today to post my fucking schedule.

117
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,330
Like...

118
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,870
So, yeah, so I was just like, wait, what?

119
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,570
Um, yeah, they announced it today.

120
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:59,090
Yeah, the custom was today and then, and then, um, um, and then, um, and then, you know, they announced it today.

121
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,650
Yeah, because, like, people, you see, people were, like, dropping out a lot.

122
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,870
So people had to, like, find players, like, other players.

123
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,470
Um, they have to find other players to replace them.

124
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,510
So they have to, they waited until today to post out the schedule and, like, post up the official announcement.

125
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,050
And even when the official announcement was made, people were still dropping out.

126
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,650
I was just like, oh my god, I feel so bad.

127
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,590
Like, they're like, these people are gonna be in it.

128
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,230
And then people were still dropping out.

129
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,450
Also need to check what time my food's gonna be here.

130
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,870
So I'm gonna be, give me a sec, guys, uh, 555.

131
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,550
Okay, guys, 555.

132
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,950
Yeah, I feel so, yeah, it was, there's just a lot.

133
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:52,010
Like, I knew, as somebody that organized it, I know it's, like, really, like, you know, it's really difficult to organize, like, coordinate 60 people to be there.

134
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,910
Um, and everything.

135
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,690
Um, uh, oh, yeah, you know what was funny?

136
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:09,130
I was re-watching, okay, so you guys know how I was in Block, for those who don't know, I was in Block Wars, the Minecraft Twitch Rivals, uh, two days ago, and I was streaming on Twitch.

137
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,590
And, you know, I was, like, watching other POVs because I was curious.

138
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,130
I was curious what they were gonna say about me.

139
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:21,250
And then people were, like, like, the team we fought, the enemy team we fought, uh, during the last game.

140
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,150
They were, like, they were basically, like, shit-talking about our block skins.

141
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,310
And they were, like, my, like, I hate those block skins, those stupid try-hards.

142
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:41,510
And then, like, the thing is, when you, like, swap to my POV or Gumi's POV, we were just, like, you know what would be funny?

143
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:54,050
What if we, like, like, our POV, my POV was literally was just, like, oh, man, it'd be so fucking funny if we just swapped the block skins.

144
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,610
Oh my god, I'll be fucking hilarious, like,

145
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,330
like, like, they're, like, people are, like, I can't believe they're trying this hard.

146
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:13,470
And then, and then the thing is, if you cut back to my POV, we were, like, the least try-hards in the entire team.

147
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,170
Like, me, Gumi, and SK were literally just fucking around and everything.

148
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,290
And then the casters, I think, were, like, oh my god, that was insane tech from Aqua.

149
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:32,770
Like, wow, swapping to block skins, what an insane tech that they just, like, thought of to, like, have an advantage to the other teams.

150
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,010
And then, like, literally us, we're, like, it'd be so fucking funny, like,

151
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,290
it's, like, it'd be so silly if we did that.

152
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:53,990
Like, yeah, it was my idea, but I did not think, like, swapping to block skins actually helped us.

153
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,930
I just thought it was fucking funny.

154
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,670
Um Um and then, like, yeah, so I was watching it.

155
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:14,710
I just thought that was so silly because literally our actual Minecraft players were trying so fucking hard and then I was just, like, yay!

156
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,550
Oh my god, we should do this.

157
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,430
Like, let's all swap to Sonic characters and start role-playing.

158
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,690
Woo!

159
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,190
Oh, so I got a call.

160
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,350
Is it about my food?

161
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,050
Give me a sec.

162
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:30,590
I got- oh, wait.

163
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,670
No, they hanged up.

164
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,470
Never mind.

165
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,090
I don't know.

166
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:34,950
Also, the- yes!

167
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,870
Okay, before we start the game, did you guys see the Pac-Man movie?

168
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,790
The Pac-Man, um, episode short trailer?

169
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,930
That shit was fucking wild.

170
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,290
I was watching, um, it popped up on my Twitter feed.

171
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,750
You know, the one where, um, oh, I found them.

172
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,950
So, you know how they're making, like, video game, like, episode adaptations?

173
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,090
And, like, um, one- I- this is the Pac-Man one.

174
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,030
I was not- I was like, what?

175
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,110
Like...

176
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,070
Yeah, so...

177
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,170
So they're making, like, an anthology series.

178
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,250
Like, um, what was it?

179
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,850
Um, Love Robots- Love Deaf Robots.

180
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,170
I don't know.

181
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,190
Robots Deaf Love or whatever.

182
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,930
So, um, so there's one for Pac-Man.

183
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,110
It's basically like that, but for video games.

184
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,850
And then it's called Secret Level.

185
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,430
Yeah, Concord is in it, too.

186
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,190
And apparently the Concord episodes were supposed to be with DLC characters.

187
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,150
And the Pac-Man one, I was like, what the fuck?

188
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,810
That's Pac-Man?

189
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:42,170
Yeah, like, that- that's literally, like, I'm just- I'm so confused.

190
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,070
I'm so fucking confused.

191
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,790
Also, okay, so...

192
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,030
Flappy Dragoons.

193
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,630
What is Flappy Dragoons?

194
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,430
Well, that's easy.

195
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,550
It's basically a fan game that you Dragoons have made for me.

196
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,870
Um, let me put- let me click, uh, let me pin the- pin in the chat.

197
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,730
Uh, down the game I'm playing.

198
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,430
All right.

199
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,210
So this is the game I'm playing- gonna be playing right now.

200
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,750
It's basically like Flappy Birds.

201
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:21,350
But like, what if like, you know, instead of birds, like, you know, instead of like, you know, the actual Flappy Bird that's apparently copyrighted, it's Dragoons.

202
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,030
I love the pixel art, though.

203
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,850
That's so cute.

204
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,410
I love the long ass necks that we all have, except for this guy right here, this guy.

205
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,370
Um, yeah, it's so cute.

206
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,090
Does anyone know what the streamer mode means?

207
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,330
I don't know what it means.

208
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,350
What is- what does it mean when I put it on streamer mode?

209
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,450
Oh my god, it could be a tomato.

210
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,270
What's fancy?

211
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,850
Oh my god, fancy!

212
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,050
Okay, legoon, egg.

213
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,570
He's just there.

214
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,510
Like, does he even flap?

215
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,670
Oh, it prevents you from being demonetized?

216
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,310
Oh, okay.

217
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,070
All right, I won't turn it off.

218
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,030
Well, there's egg.

219
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,710
What's the nerd?

220
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,630
Fucking nerd.

221
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,230
Um, ink bird.

222
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,870
Whoa.

223
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,450
Legs.

224
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,930
What is it?

225
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,010
Tired, moon, baseball.

226
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,850
Oh my god, the skins are so cute!

227
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,070
Oh, OG Doki Bird!

228
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,130
Oh my god, croaky.

229
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,650
Wait, I need to play as croaky.

230
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,510
Okay.

231
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,730
But I believe this is the credits, right?

232
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,650
Oh my god, huge shout out to all the- all the people who worked on this.

233
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,530

234
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,630
Wait, I know this guy!

235
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,950
I also know Johnny Lacone, Aphelion, Jono.

236
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,770
Oh my god, there's so many people that worked on it.

237
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,650
Music.

238
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,750
No one.

239
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,390
Wait, oh, okay.

240
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,630
I was like, oh, main theme.

241
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,110
Right here.

242
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,570
We back from the heist.

243
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,070
Oh my god, you guys made all the music, too!

244
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,550
My- oh, I remember you guys!

245
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,310
Testers.

246
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,750
Your laugh cracks me up, Doki.

247
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,790
Merry Christmas, everyone!

248
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:53,810
Merry Christmas!

249
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,190
JT, thank you for the super chat!

250
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,970
Thank you, thank you!

251
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,150
Oh my god, there's localization, too!

252
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,950
Wait, you guys localized it?

253
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,610
Oh my god, that's so cute!

254
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,350
That's actually so cute that you guys localized it.

255
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,650
Oh my god.

256
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,390
Hey, that's me!

257
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,090

Support me right here!

259
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,410
We're almost at 800k subscribers.

260
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,290
It's crazy to think about.

261
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,670
I know I said like, oh, yeah, maybe we'll hit a million.

262
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,730
I knew we weren't gonna hit a million by the end of the year.

263
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:30,050
That was like actual goals, never goals that was like a little bit too- too ambitious, you know?

264
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,290
All right, it's time.

265
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,050
Let's play Flappy Dragoon.

266
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,350
What the fuck?

267
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,830
Oh, okay.

268
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,770
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

269
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,150
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

270
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,930
Okay, I figured it out.

271
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,530
Guys, it's been a while since I- I like how- I like how it's not even me.

272
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,830
It's just some like random crow.

273
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,190
Okay, I'm gonna submit this.

274
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,670
Okay.

275
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,030
Guys, look at that, guys.

276
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,170
Oh my- what the fuck?

277
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,510
How?

278
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,330
Guys, look, I'm on the leaderboard!

279
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,350
Look at that!

280
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,890
I'm on the fucking leaderboard!

281
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,330
Let's go!

282
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,790
I knew I was better.

283
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,570
All right, let's see.

284
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,410
Let's do the default.

285
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,710
All right.

286
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,930
Oh, it's so cute!

287
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,030
It's like...

288
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,650
Oh, okay, we're not hitting the- Okay.

289
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,550
We're not hitting- okay.

290
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,250
No, we don't yet.

291
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,150
We're definitely not hitting the fucking...

292
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,830
Um, ten thousand whatever.

293
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,890
God damn it.

294
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,450
Why is this so hard?

295
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:38,870
Okay.

296
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:40,610
All right.

297
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,990
I forgot how hard Flappy Bird was.

298
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,170
I actually had Flappy Bird on my phone.

299
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,650
I think if I- Oh my god.

300
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,030
I think I still have it on my phone because I never deleted it too.

301
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,530
That shit's like worth like thousands of dollars.

302
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,470
When people used to sell it on their phone.

303
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,250
Why?

304
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,970
Why is this so hard?

305
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:02,810
Okay.

306
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,010
Oh my god.

307
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,850
It's the indent.

308
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,350
Okay.

309
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,330
It's just the hole is so tiny!

310
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,110
Okay, we're gonna try and get at least ten.

311
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,970
All right, you guys think you're better?

312
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,110
Boot up the game right now.

313
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,910
Wait, guys, can I buy this game off you guys and then we put it on Steam?

314
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,390
Yoink mine now.

315
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,590
Yoink!

316
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:50,550
Oh, this would be like created by the Doki Bird team and then it'll be like Doki Bird, Doki Bird, Doki Bird, Doki- Wait, I can literally- wait, because it's my face, it's my property.

317
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,510
I don't- technically I don't have to pay you guys.

318
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,450
Do you think you made this?

319
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,610
I made this.

320
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,950
It's literally my- Yoink, put it on.

321
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,850
Yoink, put it on Steam.

322
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,950
Technically, it's mine.

323
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,690
I'm joking though, but I won't- I don't- Honestly, I'm so open to putting this on Steam.

324
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:20,750
And like have you guys like develop more to it, like what is there to develop more for in terms of Flappy Bird though?

325
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:29,950
What the- what- I mean, technically, the Flappy Bird- Technically, if you think about it, I can't get past one point.

326
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:38,270
The Flappy Bird, uh, the Flappy Bird, uh, copyright has expi- I- how do I get past level one point?

327
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:40,770
Um...

328
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,010
Okay, here we go.

329
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,430
Wait, audio...

330
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,230
Techni- uh...

331
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,850
Technica?

332
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,090
Thank you for the super chat, Anton!

333
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,290
Thank you, thank you!

334
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,590
We'll strip the skins off our hides in this game turn- wait, what did you use for it?

335
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,850
What's audio tech- Technica?

336
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,330
Technica?

337
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,650
What is that?

338
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,400
What does it do?

339
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,540
What does it do?

340
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,240
Well, what does that do?

341
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,520
Audio managed- we use something else.

342
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,300
We will remake it.

343
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We will remake it.

344
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,600
Wait, there's like- there's more than one map?

345
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,040
Oh my god, come on, I just need 10.

346
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,840
Give me 10 points!

347
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,840
Oh my god.

348
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,920
Remake it and I'll even have recording.

349
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,280
I'll even record it.

350
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,180
Like, I'll be like, remake it now for free.

351
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,140
Obviously not for free.

352
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,820
No, I'd be so down!

353
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,640
I've always wanted to release games on Steam.

354
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,240
I think it'll be so- I've been like, looking into like, making games again.

355
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,140
Or not making, but like, producing games again.

356
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,280
And like, um, I think- oh my god, please.

357
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,760
And like, I think it'll be really cool if we could like, uh, work on this and like, I could pay you guys to remake it for Steam.

358
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:26,900
And then we can add like, different levels, different cosmetics, and like, have like, uh, recordings and stuff like that.

359
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,260
I think it'll be really cute.

360
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,460
All right, nice.

361
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,740
And then we can have like, actual like, uh, leaderboards.

362
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,620
Like, uh, like, I'm pretty sure this is like, local.

363
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,060
This has to be a local leaderboard.

364
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,840
Um, like, it's not like, synced to anything online.

365
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,220
So I think it'd be really cool if we could make it so that we can have like, actual world leaderboards.

366
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,180
And see how far people will do.

367
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,850
Oh my god, I'm so bad at- Ah!

368
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,210
Okay.

369
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,970
Uh, all right, that's fine.

370
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,690
All right, one.

371
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,750
My goal is ten.

372
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,350
Okay, two.

373
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,570
Are you serious?

374
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,210
It's the skin.

375
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,250
It's the fucking skin.

376
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,850
I refuse to believe it's- it's me.

377
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,850
I like how the egg has zero sound effects.

378
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,590
Memorable man, thank you for the 50 gifted shits!

379
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,690
Thank you, thank you!

380
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,810
Thank you so much!

381
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,510
Oh my god, please.

382
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,010
I can't believe it.

383
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,250
Okay, it's the skin.

384
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:38,870
It's the skin.

385
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,150
It's 100% the skin.

386
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,030
What if we do- okay, the tomato.

387
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,270
Wait, why is the tomato like, sci-fi?

388
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,110
Why is- Okay.

389
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,870
I like how the- I like how his sound effects is just sci-fi.

390
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,750
Oh, you guys think you're better?

391
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,890
Oh, yeah, what's your highest score right now?

392
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,990
Are you playing along?

393
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,570
There's no way.

394
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,710
There's no way.

395
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,450
There's no way.

396
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,230
It's the hitbox.

397
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,510
It's so bad.

398
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,370
Oh my god, get me out of this map.

399
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,230
I don't want to be in this area anymore.

400
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,350
Okay, all right, let's- it's the map, guys.

401
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,250
It's- it's actually the map.

402
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,410
It's- I need to like- What's the- what's kinako?

403
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,370
What is that?

404
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,270
Okay, it's the map.

405
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,090
If I do this, we'll be fine.

406
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,330
If I do traditional...

407
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,010
If I- okay, never mind.

408
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,610
Okay, it's- it's the skin, guys.

409
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,710
It's the skin.

410
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,190
It's not- it's not the- it's not- it's not me.

411
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,070
Uh...

412
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,610
Maybe as a nerd, I'll do better.

413
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,270
I'll try so hard as a nerd.

414
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,210
Okay.

415
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,190
Okay, my glasses were off.

416
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,530
Okay, okay.

417
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,470
Okay, one.

418
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,230
I'm locking in.

419
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,270
Okay, I'm not locking in now.

420
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,970
I'm- it's just because I'm hungry, chat.

421
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,770
I'm just- Guys, I haven't eaten yet.

422
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,010
Guys, I'm just- oh my god, I'm so hungry.

423
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,930
Okay, one, two, three.

424
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,970
Fucking- okay.

425
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,450
I'm getting better though.

426
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,650
I'm figuring it out.

427
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:28,810
One, two, three, four, five, six.

428
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,290
Oh my god, okay.

429
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,030
I can do it.

430
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,030
One.

431
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,050
Okay.

432
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,870
One, two- please!

433
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,130
I got the score!

434
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:57,430
One, two, three, four, five, six.

435
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,030
Seven, eight, nine.

436
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,490
Okay.

437
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,130
Oh my god, no, it's over.

438
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:10,990
Oh my god.

439
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,990
I wish there was an easier way to restart.

440
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,350
Guys!

441
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,230
I need you to restart!

442
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,670
I need an easier way to restart!

443
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,670
As an aspiring game dev, I'd like to know what game engine this was made in.

444
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,550
Thank you for the super chat.

445
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,850
Thank you.

446
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,530
Thank you.

447
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,830
All right, Dragoons, what game engine was it?

448
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,410
Oh, is it R?

449
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,350
Oh my god, it was R.

450
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,410
Guys, that's not intuitive.

451
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,010
You didn't Doki proof this.

452
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,930
Guys, you didn't Doki proof it.

453
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,550
If you had Doki proofed it, you would have been press R.

454
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,640
Oh my god.

455
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,740
I would do an Akasupa if you passed.

456
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,540
Okay, I'm locking in.

457
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,580
I'm locking in.

458
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,020
Thank you for the super chat.

459
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,380
Thank you.

460
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:51,940
Thank you.

461
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,220
Okay.

462
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,540
Okay, one, two, three, four.

463
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,340
Ah, I keep going too high!

464
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,630
Oh my god.

465
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,950
Guys, if the trees were yellow, I would have made it.

466
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,030
One, two...

467
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,190
Oh my god, come on!

468
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,850
What if I just fly above it?

469
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,430
Oh, okay, there's... I can't.

470
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,090
Sorry, the sky hates me too.

471
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:30,870
Six.

472
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:32,530
Yeah.

473
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,610
No, I keep going too high!

474
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,490
I need to thread the needle.

475
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,070
It's easier to be low.

476
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,210
What?

477
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,190
How is that a hitbox?

478
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,230
Okay, I figured out the strat.

479
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,090
It's the skin.

480
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,510
It's the skin, but I figured it out.

481
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,810
I need a new skin.

482
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,300
I'm so tired.

483
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,820
Okay.

484
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,880
Guys, what's the meta?

485
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,380
Guys, what skin is the meta?

486
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,380
Guys?

487
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,060
Guys, what skin is the meta?

488
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,180
I need to know.

489
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,260
Wait, ojidoki is meta?

490
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,340
Is it the crow?

491
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,500
Oh, is the crow actually meta?

492
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,560
Okay, okay.

493
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,860
Is fancy actually... okay.

494
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,280
I can definitely tell fancy is not the meta.

495
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,820
Wait, different skins actually have different hitboxes?

496
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,000
Wait, who is the smallest?

497
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,660
It's not her.

498
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,780
It's definitely not.

499
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,580
Oh my god, my legs is gonna touch something.

500
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,280
What would be the smallest?

501
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,420
I guess default, right?

502
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,660
Because there's no way it's the egg.

503
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,160
Okay, I think default is the smallest.

504
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,010
Okay, locked in.

505
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,050
Oh my god.

506
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,570
Okay, locked in for real.

507
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:27,890
Okay, one, two, three, four, five.

508
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,220
Okay.

509
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,500
Come on, I just need 20.

510
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,600
Okay, one, two...

511
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,480
Oh, this is so difficult.

512
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,720
It's only been 30 minutes.

513
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,780
It's only been 30 minutes.

514
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,080
I don't understand.

515
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,120
Okay, three, five, six.

516
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh my god.

517
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,060
Okay.

518
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,820
I can't, I can't.

519
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,640
This has to be... this has to be harder than Flappy Birds.

520
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,260
There's no way.

521
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,360
If I could tap my screen, it'd be so over.

522
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,040
If I could tap my phone, if I could be like... if I tap my screen, I'd do better.

523
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,200
Oh my god, please.

524
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,080
I just want to hit 20.

525
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,280
Bro, it does not... I feel like I've been playing this game for like 20 years already.

526
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,100
Okay, one.

527
00:31:52,820 --> 00:32:02,700
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

528
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,220
Oh

529
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,800
my god.

530
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,940
Three, four, five, six.

531
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,940
I swear, I swear to god.

532
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,640
Where does the top tree come from?

533
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,620
How does the tree grow like that?

534
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,020
I'm getting unimmersed.

535
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,980
It's because of my immersion.

536
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,860
It's a lack of immersion.

537
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,080
Yeah, if you... if you fucking tap a dragoon, you crush his entire skull.

538
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,360
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

539
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,280
Oh, I'm gonna use my mouse.

540
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,500
Oh, maybe it's because I'm not using my mouse.

541
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,480
Oh my god, it doesn't matter.

542
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,380
It doesn't matter what I use.

543
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,380
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't even get to 10.

544
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,820
One, two, three.

545
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,040
Guys, it's a lot harder than you think.

546
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,580
Five, six.

547
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,260
When's my food gonna get here?

548
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,060
When's my food getting here?

549
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,660
Okay, $5.59.

550
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:46,920
Guys...

551
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,160
Guys, I swear this is a lot harder than it looks.

552
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,460
Guys, I'm not bad.

553
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,540
I swear.

554
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,820
Oh my god.

555
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

556
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,880
Thank you, thank you.

557
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,700
Donate, thank you for the super chat.

558
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,700
Thank you, thank you.

559
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
Maybe he should have went with dead.

560
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,680
Oh my god.

561
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,580
Why is it so hard keeping it dead?

562
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,480
Guys, this should... you should... guys, I think you guys should lower the difficult.

563
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,660
Next patch note, I think you should have a doki bird mode and then like... and then like...

564
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:44,860
make the hitbox like... you should make a mode that's like only for doki bird and then you gotta give me the pass that you can only unlock via password.

565
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,360
And then like... and then mix my hitbox like one pixel.

566
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,840
Like I want to be like those... like what was it?

567
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,380
Those like...

568
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,500
um, Geometry Dash cheaters where like you can have a cheat in Geometry Dash.

569
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,560
Where like the hit... there's like no hitbox.

570
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,560
But as long as you tap in time, like people will think you're doing it correctly.

571
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,560
I want to be that guy.

572
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:10,960
Was it that?

573
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,420
I saw... I saw a video.

574
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,220
I saw a video of like, um, an OC.

575
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:23,320
I don't know, the Geometry Dash pro that got caught for cheating because all he did was he disabled...

576
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:32,580
he disabled the hitbox on Geometry Dash and then like, um, and all he did was just because there's like a camera on his hand too.

577
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:40,820
And he just like made sure to like, uh, to tap to the... to the sync of his... of his... of his, uh, jumps.

578
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,580
So we gotta do that too.

579
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:51,700
As long as you give me a password that only I can access and then like... wait, maybe I can access the files.

580
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,760
Hahaha!

581
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,820
Delete my hitbox.

582
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,580
That's all I want.

583
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,720
Someone develop a cheat... a cheat engine for this game.

584
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,240
Like how there's cheat engines for CSGO.

585
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,900
Someone develop one for Flappy Dragoon.

586
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,980
And I'll download it.

587
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,260
I don't care if you put like, um...

588
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,740
I don't care if you put like, spyware.

589
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,460
As long as it works, it's fine.

590
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:18,960
Oh

591
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,950
my god, he always just jumps.

592
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:36,660
I never get to... I never get to end.

593
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,260
Okay.

594
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,640
Okay.

595
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,980
Someone was like, which is worse, Flappy Dragoon or RockSuki?

596
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,300
RockSuki, at least I made fucking progress.

597
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,080
Like...

598
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,360
I don't think I'll ever... I can't even make progress in this game!

599
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh my

600
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,640
god.

601
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,110
Oh my god!

602
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,830
There's no improvement!

603
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,990
There's actually no improvement!

604
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,210
Okay, I'm locking in.

605
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,350
I'm actually gonna lock in.

606
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,810
Please never cry.

607
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,860
Okay.

608
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,380
Like some of these hitboxes are actually bullshit.

609
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,180
Oh my god!

610
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,260
Please, I just won.

611
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,120
I won 10.

612
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,480
I won 10!

613
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,360
Okay.

614
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,840
I'm always so close.

615
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,920
I think my favorite panel from Queen Never Cry is just...

616
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,580
Like, I never even read the... Okay, I don't know if you guys read the first chapter of that, uh...

617
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,940
Webtoon, but it's so fucking wild.

618
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,320
Like...

619
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,180
It's actually so wild.

620
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,240
Oh my god.

621
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,640
Okay, guys.

622
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,500
I need to shut the fuck up.

623
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,750
New record though, new record!

624
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,080
I'm actually getting better.

625
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,770
Oh my god, everyone tells me.

626
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,110
No!

627
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,430
It's a ping.

628
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,330
It's a ping.

629
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,970
John, thank you for the super chat.

630
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,350
Thank you.

631
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:23,890
Thank you.

632
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,490
Don't worry.

633
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,590
It took me four hours to get a score of 21.

634
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,890
I don't have four hours.

635
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,710
Thank you for the super chat.

636
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,070
Thank you.

637
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,110
Thank you.

638
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,590
Thank you for the magenta soup.

639
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,930
Thank you.

640
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,170
Almost there.

641
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,390
Thank you for the five gifts and chips.

642
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,630
Thank you.

643
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,810
Bro, this game is so hard!

644
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,470
Like, why is this Flappy Bird is easier than this?

645
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,260
I swear, I think you should add yellow paint.

646
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,340
Honestly, if there was yellow paint, it would've been over.

647
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,340
It would've been over.

648
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,260
It's okay.

649
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,120
It's okay.

650
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,430
It's okay.

651
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,290
It's okay.

652
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:44,390
Five,

653
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,700
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

654
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,310
God!

655
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,030
Pay up!

656
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,430
Pay the fuck up!

657
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,010
Oh my God!

658
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,210
Who said it took four hours?

659
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,730
Get fucked, John!

660
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,970
It took me 30 minutes!

661
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,130
Get fucking shit on!

662
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:09,190
I know you gave me money, but like, you gave me money to motivate me, but get your fucking shit on!

663
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,850
Four hours, 30 minutes for me!

664
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,690
Thank you for the aqua, aqua, aqua soup!

665
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,650
Thank you, thank you.

666
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,450
Parappa, thank you for the five gifts and chips.

667
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,390
Thank you, thank you.

668
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,450
Mike, thank you for the superchat.

669
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,390
Thank you, thank you.

670
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,350
The true game.

671
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,110
I think my food's almost here.

672
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,430
Give me a sec.

673
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,390
Oh shit!

674
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,110
Okay, guys, I'm gonna get my food.

675
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,230
I'll be right back.

676
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,030
I'm here.

677
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:10,590
I'm here now.

678
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:11,770
Alright.

679
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:12,870
Oh my God.

680
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,250
I locked the fucking... I'm gonna beat that score.

681
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:16,570
I'm gonna beat it.

682
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,610
I'm gonna fucking beat it.

683
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,450
Oh wait, my food.

684
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,670
Not now, I realized.

685
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,050
I'm back!

686
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:23,990
I got my food!

687
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,430
I'm super excited.

688
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,690
I'm so fucking hungry.

689
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,530
Holy shit.

690
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,850
I'm really fucking hungry right now.

691
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,710
But no, we're gonna beat the score first.

692
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,090
I think I've, like, figured it out.

693
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,330
I'm, like, so motivated now.

694
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,050
I won't eat until I beat it.

695
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,030
Okay, maybe...

696
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,150
Second ice soup arc is gonna be crazy!

697
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,190
Zacona, thank you for the superchat.

698
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,230
Thank you, thank you.

699
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,910
Yeah, you thought I wouldn't make it.

700
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,210
You thought I couldn't get it.

701
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,010
It's, like, K-O-O... What's it called?

702
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,170
It's, like, the bee skewers.

703
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,170
The koo bee... I can't pronounce it.

704
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,890
It's so good, though.

705
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,450
What is it called?

706
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,890
The koo... K-O-O-B...

707
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,850
I don't know how to pronounce it.

708
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,750
I also don't know how to spell it.

709
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,690
I don't know how...

710
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,450
Well, it's not skewer.

711
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,390
It's not skewer, sorry.

712
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,090
It's, like... Oh, koo bee day.

713
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,330
Yes, yes, koo bee day!

714
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,250
I might be butchering it.

716
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,630
It's so good.

717
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,730
I'm, like, obsessed with, like, Persian food.

718
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:36,910
Um...

719
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,090
Because it's, like, it's actually, like...

720
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:39,850
It's... Oh, my God.

721
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:40,610
Like, I don't know.

722
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:44,390
The softness of the meat itself is just...

723
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,250
It's just a whole other world.

724
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:47,910
The texture.

725
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,830
I just love the texture.

726
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,730
It's just basically, like, grounded beef.

727
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,110
Um, it's very... And then with the rice, like, um...

728
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,850
With the special rice that comes with it.

729
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,510
Because it has, like, a yellow patch.

730
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,030
It's, like, yellowed rice.

731
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,690
But I don't know exactly what it is...

732
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,690
What the... I don't know exactly what...

733
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,690
The taste of it is.

734
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:06,890
Um... Oh, wait.

735
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:07,650
Is that Iranian?

736
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,150
I thought it was Persian.

737
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,850
Because some Persian restaurants serve it, too.

738
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,690
I didn't realize it was Iranian.

739
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,430
I thought it was Persian.

740
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,690
Um, because, like, some...

741
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,630
Wait, isn't it...

742
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:21,930
Wait, is Iran...

743
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,790
Iranian is... Okay, now...

744
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,410
Okay, now I'm, like...

745
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:27,610
Guys, I don't know my geography.

746
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,550
I'm so sorry.

747
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:30,910
I'm so...

748
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,870
I thought... I'm so sorry.

749
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,650
I didn't know it's the same.

750
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,610
I don't know my geography.

751
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,290
But it's so good.

752
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,770
What kind of rice is it, too?

753
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,390
I don't even know what rice it is.

754
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:48,910
But it's, like, a yellow patch.

755
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,430
If you've never had Persian food, you guys gotta try it.

756
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,530
Especially with the grounded beef.

757
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,470
It's... Oh, my God.

758
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,010
Like, I... I have it, like, once every...

759
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,750
Every couple of weeks.

760
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,910
There's, like, so much food.

761
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:03,890
Or, like, I try...

762
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,170
Oh, guys, I...

763
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:08,030
I made spaghetti... I made spaghetti yesterday.

764
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,370
It was so good that I made it twice.

765
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,450
Wait, wait, let me log in real fast.

766
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:15,930
Okay, I need to show you guys a picture.

767
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:18,230
Um...

768
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,450
Because I sent it to my friend because I was so proud of myself.

769
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,870
Because I haven't cooked food in a long-ass time.

770
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,630
So, like, I was so proud of myself.

771
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,910
Because I got pots and pans!

772
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:27,830
Wait, I need to show you guys.

773
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,550
I made spaghetti.

774
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,030
And I made it, like, twice.

775
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,990
Because I was so proud... Because it was so good.

776
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,070
So I made it again.

777
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:38,770
My bacon expired.

778
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,370
But, like, um...

779
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,410
I used spam instead.

780
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:44,710
So...

781
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:45,450
Guys, look!

782
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,190
It's, like, I put, like...

783
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,570
I used, like, those...

784
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,590
It was, like, eggs with cheese.

785
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,650
I had, like, fancy cheese that I bought from Whole Foods.

786
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,330
And then, um...

787
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,070
I put spam in it.

788
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,750
And it was so good.

789
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:01,350
Oh my god.

790
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,750
And I made it twice yesterday.

791
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,730
I, like, literally made it.

792
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:08,910
It's, like, a fucking mishmash of, like, different things.

793
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,090
And it's not a paper plate!

794
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:11,870
What do you mean by...

795
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,250
It was so good.

796
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,130
And there's scrambled eggs, too.

797
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:17,130
And...

798
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,830
And everything.

799
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,270
It was... Oh my god.

800
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,470
I was so... Oh my god.

801
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,450
It was so good that I actually made it twice.

802
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,210
Because I was like, I want to eat this again.

803
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,190
Yeah, I can cook!

804
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,450
Thank you for the super chat.

805
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,070
It's also spaghetti.

806
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,990
But, no, I can actually cook.

807
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,910
I can't bake.

808
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,190
Because baking, you actually need to be, like, super precise with measurements.

809
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,230
But I can cook meals.

810
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,710
The issue is that...

811
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,890
I don't normally cook meals.

812
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,230
Because, like, when you live alone...

813
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,790
It's such a hassle to make something nice for yourself.

814
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,070
And then you have to clean everything afterwards.

815
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,310
Like, I still haven't cleaned...

816
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,030
Okay.

817
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,670
Um...

818
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,270
Okay, you guys can judge me for this.

819
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:57,550
I...

820
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,830
Also, another reason why I was like, I'm going to make it again.

821
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,330
Was because I didn't really want to clean my pan.

822
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,530
Right then.

823
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,750
So I was like, well, I'll just reuse it.

824
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,230
Because, um...

825
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,050
I literally just used it today.

826
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,870
Like, at lunch time.

827
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:14,930
So I can reuse it during dinner.

828
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:15,570
So...

829
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,070
And then I'll clean it after.

830
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:21,770
Because, like...

831
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:24,110
I technically don't need to clean it yet.

832
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,790
And there's no mold yet!

833
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,610
It's literally the same day!

834
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,670
And it's the same day!

835
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,570
So, like...

836
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,610
I was just like...

837
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:34,850
Well, technically...

838
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,170
Because it's only been, like, you know, a few...

839
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,330
Like, a couple of hours.

840
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,470
Um, I don't have...

841
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,330
I can literally reuse the...

842
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:42,950
The pan!

843
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,330
So, like...

844
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,130
The pan where I mixed everything together.

845
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,890
Because technically, it's the...

846
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:51,970
It's the same day!

847
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,190
Only a couple of hours have passed!

848
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,690
So...

849
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,810
No...

850
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,690
No, no, I'm fine.

851
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,490
It's been 24 hours.

852
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,650
Nothing has happened!

853
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:08,610
Nothing!

854
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:09,750
See?

855
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:10,990
You can't judge me!

856
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,330
Because you would do the same thing!

857
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,290
You would've done the same thing!

858
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,410
But I was super proud of myself.

859
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,270
Because I haven't cooked in a long time.

860
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,010
And I made spaghetti.

861
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,570
I went to Whole Foods and bought cheese.

862
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,570
I didn't buy anything else in Whole Foods.

863
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:28,610
Because it's Whole Foods.

864
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:29,970
Like...

865
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,690
I was like...

866
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,690
It was very expensive cheese.

867
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,990
Because I was like, you know what?

868
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,070
I want some expensive cheese.

869
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,930
I will wash it.

870
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,610
And then I reused the plate, too.

871
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,170
Because I was like, well...

872
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,350
Technically, like...

873
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,490
I did reuse the fork.

874
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,310
I used a different fork, though.

875
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,330
Actually, no.

876
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,490
I washed the fork.

877
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,010
I washed the fork, but I didn't wash the plate.

878
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:58,190
Because I was like, well, technically...

879
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,150
It's the same plate which I ate the last spaghetti.

880
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,170
So, like...

881
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,290
It's like leftovers.

882
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,150
I washed the fork.

883
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,350
If anything, I washed the fork.

884
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,970
I just didn't wash the plate.

885
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,680
Alright, nice.

886
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:15,340
Okay.

887
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:16,940
Fifteen.

888
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,020
What was my rate?

889
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,080
I stopped locking in.

890
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,820
Guys, I was just trying to...

891
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,120
I was very environmentally conscious, guys.

892
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,840
I was just trying to save the environment.

893
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,700
Hey, Doki.

894
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,740
I also get the cooking not wanting to clean.

895
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,080
See?

896
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:32,620
Validation.

897
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,720
Thank you for enabling me.

898
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,300
Salty.

899
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:35,740
Thank you.

900
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,500
Thank you for the super chat.

901
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,420
Thank you.

902
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,880
See?

903
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,800
Thank you for being part of my echo chamber.

904
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,780
I'm like so down to like...

905
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,080
Help you guys like...

906
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,500
Fun to improve this game.

907
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,540
Because I think we could definitely make it even better.

908
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,980
With like different cosmetics.

909
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,220
Different levels.

910
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,100
More songs.

911
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,340
Different game modes.

912
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:01,980
And everything.

913
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,800
A global... I think a global...

914
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,220
Multiplayer leaderboard would be like...

915
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:07,540
Fun.

916
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,060
Okay, what the fuck is power- Oh yeah, power-ups!

917
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:12,640
You're right.

918
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,320
We could technically add power-ups.

919
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,240
Like extra life.

920
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,260
If you like...

921
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,120
You get enough points in...

922
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,900
And then you can go to the shop...

923
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,840
And buy like extra lives and stuff.

924
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,680
Like pay to win.

925
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,120
We love pay to win.

926
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,340
Skill- What the- What is battle royale?

927
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,180
Whoever can last the longest in Flappy Dragoon.

928
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,360
Okay.

929
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,180
God damn it.

930
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,340
Okay, my goal before end stream.

931
00:58:52,700 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh no, not the crypto- Did you see the Hawktua girl made a crypto meme cryptocurrency and people got so mad at her because like...

932
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,800
It lost like 80% of its value within a day.

933
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,580
I'm like, why the fuck did you invest in that?

934
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,180
It was obviously a rug pull.

935
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,020
She's so smart.

936
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,220
She's so business smart.

937
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,360
Like...

938
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,600
She sold...

939
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,920
She sold out so hard.

940
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,340
She knew her fucking meme is not eternal.

941
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:29,140
It's like, I don't even know how the fuck that meme lasted as long as it did.

942
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:35,760
She knew she's gonna be like, fade into obscurity very fast.

943
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,860
So she cashed out so much.

944
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,680
She cashed out so fucking much that she's set for life.

945
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,440
Alright, nice.

946
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,880
2... 3...

947
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,040
Oh my god.

948
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,920
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

949
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,600
Thank you, thank you.

950
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,920
Please tell me you at least rinsed the plate with water.

951
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,640
I guess I won't say anything then.

952
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,360
Thank you for the super chat.

953
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:08,780
Thank you.

954
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,800
Thank you.

955
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,640
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

956
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,060
Thank you.

957
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,860
Thank you.

958
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:20,320
Get rid of the flavor from the old pasta?

959
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,160
That I ate like a couple of hours before?

960
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,700
When she goes to jail, it'd be locked to a...

961
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,700
Thank you for the super chat.

962
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,160
Thank you.

963
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,080
Thank you.

964
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,060
What's crazy is that Crypto is back.

965
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,840
I was not expecting that.

966
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:55,580
Because there was like a grey... I don't know if NFTs are back, but I know like cryptocurrency is back now.

967
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,420
Why?

968
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,440
I don't know.

969
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,520
Because people are scared about government.

970
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:11,240
They don't want it to be regulated by the government because cryptocurrency isn't regulated by anything.

971
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,660
Apparently people are like...

972
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,300
who held their money...

973
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,780
You know what they should be doing if they're so scared of the government?

974
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,140
Why can't we go back to the old ways where we just buried gold?

975
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,240
It's more fun too.

976
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:39,020
It's more fun because if you die to your gold, you can make it like a little treasure hunt every time if you need to pay something.

977
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,520
If they're so scared.

978
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:54,720
I miss the good old days when people were scared about the government and banks where they would just buy a bunch of gold and then bury it under their bed or something.

979
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,360
Under the floorboards.

980
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,600
Or within the socks.

981
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,700
Because it can double as a weapon too.

982
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,100
We can use it as a weapon and as a paperweight.

983
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:18,300
And then it can be a nice little fun treasure hunt for all your friends when you die.

984
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:33,180
Like, imagine having like, you know, a hundred thousand dollars of gold buried around the world and you be like, in your will, you're like, hello friends, if you wanna find my treasure, you gotta figure out this treasure map.

985
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,380
It's like a fun little mini game.

986
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,860
They're all your family and friends.

987
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,680
Oh my god, please.

988
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,760
I just invest my money in vtubers.

989
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,540
Thank you for the super chat.

990
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,400
Thank you, thank you.

991
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,890
No, come on.

992
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,590
What do you mean worst in crypt?

993
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,530
Who are you, Timothy McKenzie?

994
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:09,810
That's right.

995
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,050
That's so smart.

996
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,690
Putting your full name first and last name, Timothy McKenzie.

997
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,990
Mr. McKenzie, does your mom know you're watching a vtuber right now?

998
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,370
How dare you say it's worst in crypto?

999
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,350
That's fucked up.

1000
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,790
At least, like, I provide physical things.

1001
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:38,470
Imagine using your whole name as a as a username.

1002
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:45,110
That's right, I'ma google you right now, Mr. Timothy McKenzie.

1003
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:51,590
How many Timothy McKenzie's are out in this world?

1004
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,930
There's a lot.

1005
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,990
There's an actor named Timothy McKenzie.

1006
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:56,870
Are you an actor?

1007
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,110
Are you Labyrinth?

1008
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:58,810
Is this you?

1009
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:03,930
Bro, is this you?

1010
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:04,350
Are you?

1011
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:12,870
It's my baltech handle.

1012
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:19,990
It's not doxy when it's public!

1013
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,190
The game is getting to me, yeah.

1014
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:38,230
I swear, that Apex custom that we did, um, we had, like, we spent more time fucking fishing than we did playing the fucking video game.

1015
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:44,800
Oh my god.

1016
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,820
JL, thank you for the magenta, super!

1017
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,860
Thank you, thank you.

1018
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,600
Investing in vtubers have far better returns.

1019
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,740
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1020
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,340
Investing in me gives you so much more.

1021
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,880
This is a fact that Doki is a bird.

1022
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,300
If anyone argue against it, they are liars.

1023
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,060
Thank you for the super chat, one guy, thank you.

1024
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,680
Oh my god, I looked at chat.

1025
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,760
Thank you, thank you.

1026
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,520
Tequila, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1027
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,800
If we trace the line of where FlappyDragoon goes, it's like a crypto stock market.

1028
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,100
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1029
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,860
I like how someone was like, I reselled because you docked someone live on stream.

1030
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,100
You're like, bro, I fuck with that.

1031
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,640
You're just like, oh my god, if I don't, maybe she'll do it.

1032
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,560
If I don't resell, maybe she'll do me next.

1033
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:46,000
Wait, unfortunately, I'm already a public persona?

1034
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,220
Oh my god, are you fucking famous?

1035
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,120
Okay.

1036
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,820
Alright, TKF Okay, that's not your real, that's not your real name?

1037
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,300
Who the fuck makes their first and last name like...

1038
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,600

Like, I don't know.

1113
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:38,370
I feel like...

1114
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,030
You know, it's like let's go gambling.

1115
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,250
But you're life savings.

1116
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,270
Yeah, a lot of them are like rug pulls.

1117
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:53,590
I was watching a video of like this little kid that was scamming like...

1118
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,910
Millennials and boomers.

1119
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,970
Oh my god, please.

1120
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:04,910
With like made up with like crypto coin and they just made them invest in it and then like he like rug pulls it.

1121
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,570
Because they're like, oh my god, we gotta get in on this market.

1122
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,190
And then this kid made like $400,000 in crypto.

1123
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,370
He hasn't even hit puberty yet.

1124
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,750
That's a crazy thing.

1125
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:19,510
Yeah.

1126
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:20,910
Oh, do you make 30k?

1127
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,510
I thought you made like 400k.

1128
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,030
He did like three times too.

1129
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:33,030
Like damn, like zoomers like...

1130
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:40,830
When I was like that kid, like he hasn't hit puberty yet and he's like scamming the elderly.

1131
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,110
Bro, you know what?

1132
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:43,670
I was worried.

1133
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:44,410
You know what?

1134
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:48,550
I was playing fucking playing Pokemon before I realized like it's the same game.

1135
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:51,330
Sorry to all the Pokemon fans out there.

1136
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:55,530
I just have I haven't fucked with Pokemon a long time.

1137
01:11:55,610 --> 01:12:03,070
I love like I still love like the designs of some of their Pokemon, but like I'm so bored with Pokemon games.

1138
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:18,570
And also I never got into like I got into like uh I got into like Pokemon cards when I was like really young not like I know like a lot of people like collecting Pokemon cards and stuff.

1139
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:24,490
Um, I never I I like got into it when I was like super young but you know Like when you're super young you're like pretty colors.

1140
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:25,430
That's me.

1141
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:28,970
I never like actually got into Pokemon card collecting.

1142
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,750
Um, so like I never like cared about it too like much.

1143
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:39,230
Like the only gacha thing that I actually like is like physical toy gacha, you know?

1144
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:43,850
Like the gachapon machines and like the blind boxes as long as it's cute.

1145
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,390
I like that like figure wise.

1146
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,170
I just never got into like cards.

1147
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,200
Okay Oh my god

1148
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,400
I just want to break my record.

1149
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,620
I always fly too high like that's like my issue

1150
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:19,350
I'm getting better though Like I sort of ah Every time every time I get a little bit confident.

1151
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:22,070
I get a little bit fucking confident

1152
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:32,100
I think the weirdest part about Pokemon cards is the fact that like Um, they don't put them.

1153
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,060
Oh, okay.

1154
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:51,000
There's like several things weird I was like going to like london drugs, which is like a canadian a canadian like marketplace Um where it sells everything and they have like cards as well Like they like now they lock up the pokemon cards because people I guess like people keep like stealing them.

1155
01:13:51,020 --> 01:14:08,920
So like um So like they would like Lock they now lock up They lock up pokemon cards because like and that's like the only thing locked like I would see like electronics and everything But they're not locked like they're you know, you can buy kettles you can buy like,

1156
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:30,640
uh Buy like electronics and stuff like very expensive Electronics and everything but like you can grab them whenever but when it comes to pokemon cards Like you got they gotta lock it up into a fucking storage thing And you have to get like an attendant to come over there to grab it for you Yeah,

1157
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:43,160
there's like a huge scalper problem and I feel like you know, there's like that type of problem I know like a lot of people a lot of stores in na they don't limit they don't limit it in japan They do in japan.

1158
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,840
It's like you gotta buy like one box or something.

1159
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,780
You can only buy like one box and stuff

1160
01:14:51,440 --> 01:15:02,160
And like one of my like I was like hanging out with um Some friends and then like they wanted to buy some pokemon cards and they were like, um, and we're like, okay Yeah, we can come with you.

1161
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:20,480

1163
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,320

1197
01:20:51,550 --> 01:21:04,770
But what about like the keychain oh the keychain It'll be a dragoon Don't keep visualizing out of the dragon next to you.

1198
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:05,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1199
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:06,090
Thank you.

1200
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:15,590
Thank you I'm just saying if Sora had a gun he would not be there would be no Roxas

1201
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:31,510
And people like no not Roxas he was the best part Yeah, but not like non Kingdom Hearts 2 when I had to fail a three hours of his fucking tutorial

1202
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:46,690
Everyone I know I have a friend that's so fucking obsessed with him.

1203
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:59,250
Um No, I know I lived through that um Thank you for the five Thank you.

1204
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,530
Thank you You're right.

1205
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:23,990
If Sora had a gun there would be no Xehanort Honestly, I still think the funniest thing is that the creator of Kingdom Hearts has to watch like um history of Kingdom Hearts Just to remember what the fuck he did I can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 4 to be bit to be just the city Like he's just Sora is apparently just a fucking normie in the end

1206
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:53,320
Well, you guys didn't know no I talked about it before in a previous stream the creator of Kingdom Hearts literally watches like Like he forgets what happened like he forgets some of the shit that he like made up so like he would like pull up like Kingdom Hearts like YouTube analysis videos like And history videos to be like what the fuck did I do just to like remember what?

1207
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:56,640
Just to make sure it all still connected

1208
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:15,680
No, it is wild it's no longer about like the original concept the Kingdom Hearts was like Final fantasy and like disney characters like a final fantasy slash disney crossover But now there's so many fucking original characters.

1209
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,760
Like I don't know what the fuck is going on

1210
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,560
Um back, thank you, let's super chat.

1211
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:35,860
Thank you.

1212
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:47,060
Thank you Lore wise roxas would still have to happen Since he came for Sora to free Kairi's heart which got trapped before he had the key Thank you for the super chat.

1213
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:47,440
Thank you.

1214
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,240
Thank you.

1215
01:23:48,460 --> 01:24:02,320
Yeah, but like If he had a gun He didn't have to turn into a heartless To be cut he didn't have to turn into a heartless to get Kairi's heart back You could have just shot the guy

1216
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,320
I'm pretty sure he's not like immune to fucking bullets like

1217
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:21,760
There's no way But that's murder where the fuck did the heartless go when they die?

1218
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:37,840
Wait, wait, what the fuck a keyblade was still killing Like that's murder Die it's just they die faster The kingdom hearts

1219
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:46,800
Now it's murder

1220
01:24:52,170 --> 01:25:01,980
You should just all have guns give goofy a gun Instead of this weak-ass shield Where do we even get a gun?

1221
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,120
It's Final Fantasy!

1222
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,500
They all have guns!

1223
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,600
Which is surprising, why don't they...

1224
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,360
All the characters with guns in Final Fantasy don't show up.

1225
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,920
Instead, they're given, like, stupid fucking swords.

1226
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,860
They're given melee weapons.

1227
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,700
Yeah, but he doesn't use it.

1228
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,620
He still uses his stupid sword.

1229
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,340
Take that back, Doki.

1230
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,840
His gun sword was not stupid.

1231
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:41,290
Yeah, but he doesn't even use the gun part!

1232
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:46,010
I remember playing Kingdom Hearts and he doesn't even use his gun part.

1233
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:48,610
It just goes, like, slash, slash.

1234
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:49,750
I'm like, you have a gun.

1235
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:50,610
Shoot it.

1236
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,050
Shoot your...

1237
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,390
Nexie, thank you for the super chat.

1238
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,090
Thank you, thank you.

1239
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:05,550
Someone once wrote, Akuroku fanfic for creative writing coursework and got away with it.

1240
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:06,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1241
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:08,170
Thank you, thank you.

1242
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,130
Oh, don't worry.

1243
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:13,330
I have a friend.

1244
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:15,510
Like, that friend that was super obsessed with Roxas.

1245
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:19,370
I bet they read... I bet they read your fanfic.

1246
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,240
I'm...

1247
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,700
I'm about to fucking freak out right now.

1248
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,940
I never got into Final Fantasy.

1249
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,040
I think I told you guys about this before, but, like...

1250
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:42,240
But, like, when Final Fantasy... I got into...

1251
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:47,060
The first Final Fantasy game I played was the X2 one.

1252
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,440
The X-2 one.

1253
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,820
Where, like... Yeah, I started the worst Final Fantasy game in the series.

1254
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:57,560
And then, you know, I didn't understand anything because apparently that was supposed to be a sequel...

1255
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,640
To, like, another Final Fantasy game.

1256
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,600
But that was the very first Final Fantasy game I bought.

1257
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,160
So, like, I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

1258
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,080
Because I started off with a fucking sequel.

1259
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,900
And then I was really young, too, so I was, like, even more confused.

1260
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,500
And so... So... Yeah.

1261
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,740
Because, like, it just came out.

1262
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,180
And then, like, I was like, ooh, Final Fantasy.

1263
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,120
I heard stuff about it.

1264
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,120
I was, like, really young.

1265
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:26,300
And I was like, ooh, I heard stuff about this game.

1266
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,660
And I was really, really fucking young.

1267
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:30,520
So, like, I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

1268
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,660
And I also did not understand what the fuck was going on.

1269
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,820
And then, like... And then I, you know, I didn't like it.

1270
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:37,160
So I was just like, you know what?

1271
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,120
Final Fantasy isn't for me.

1272
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:42,400
And then, I was like... And then, like, years passed.

1273
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,620
And I was like, you know what?

1274
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,460
I'm gonna give Final Fantasy another try.

1275
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:50,420
And you know what Final Fantasy game it was when I decided that?

1276
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,720
It was the one with lightning.

1277
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,040
So...

1278
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,280
I was like, alright.

1279
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:01,960
Let's try.

1280
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,460
Let's try to, like, let's try that.

1281
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,720
It's a new game.

1282
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:06,640
Oh my god, wait.

1283
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,220
Wait, guys, I need to lock in.

1284
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,380
50.

1285
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,220
Oh my god.

1286
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,080
I got 50, though.

1287
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,900
I got 50.

1288
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,280
Okay.

1289
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:57,780
Okay, wait, no.

1290
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:00,440
Give Sora a gun.

1291
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,260
There you go.

1292
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,180
There you go.

1293
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:04,860
Give Sora...

1294
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:08,640
Alright, I was so locked in.

1295
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,200
I was so fucking locked in there.

1296
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,400
Oh yeah, but anyway.

1297
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,140
So I was like, I'm gonna give it another try.

1298
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,120
So it was the lightning.

1299
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,540
The game with lightning in it.

1300
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,460
And then, I didn't like it that much either.

1301
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:25,160
Cause I was like, I don't know, apparently a lot of people didn't like it.

1302
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:28,800
So like, I chose the second wrong game to get into.

1303
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:33,240
And then, so then I never gave Final Fantasy a shot after that.

1304
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,540
I was just like, yeah, like...

1305
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,460
I was literally like, yeah.

1306
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,840
I guess, and then that's why I never got into it.

1307
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:46,360
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1308
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,440
Thank you, thank you.

1309
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:52,720
If only SmallDoki bought FFX instead of FFX2, what would've happened?

1310
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:53,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1311
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:54,740
Thank you, thank you.

1312
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,880
Avelia, thank you for the five gifted ships.

1313
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:57,860
Thank you, thank you.

1314
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,960
You know, I did say, I'm gonna break my record before I call it.

1315
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,180
Alright, I know this is a short stream, guys.

1316
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:04,580
I know it was a short stream.

1317
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:06,720
But I did do an earlier stream today.

1318
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:12,320
And I have a lot of work to do behind the scenes today.

1319
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,380
So I gotta work on that.

1320
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,020
And I'm gonna eat my food.

1321
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:16,540
I'm hungry.

1322
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,460
Hey guys, for the developers, that was really fun.

1323
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,260
Thank you to the team that made Flappy Dragoon.

1324
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,240
I would love to work with you guys on improving this in the future.

1325
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,500
If the dev team is open for it.

1326
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:36,620
I would love to like, maybe perhaps refine it more.

1327
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,100
And have a Steam release to it.

1328
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,940
Anton, thank you for the AkaSupa.

1329
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,200
Thank you, thank you.

1330
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,560
Doki, before you head out, can you try clicking the question on the main menu?

1331
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:45,520
Sure, what is it?

1332
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,220
Hello, thanks for playing our game.

1333
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,160
This is made as a team experience exercise for something bigger.

1334
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,040
A more action oriented...

1335
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:57,920
Oh, what?

1336
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:02,680
We could use your house.

1337
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:04,560
Wait, there's more?

1338
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,330
Oh my god, that's so...

1339
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:14,610
Wait, you guys are making more?

1340
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:16,310
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

1341
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:20,550
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

1342
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,770
Thank you guys.

1343
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:23,650
Thank you, Dragoons.

1344
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:25,110
It really means so much.

1345
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:26,870
Excellent, thank you for the super chat.

1346
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:27,830
Thank you, thank you.

1347
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:32,670
As one of those, I'm so happy for my Oshi to play our game with Shaking my Solid Knees.

1348
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:35,110
I recommend also trying Doki Flat by Rice Snack.

1349
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:35,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1350
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:36,210
Thank you.

1351
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:38,790
Yeah, I'll be down to try to avoid games from you guys.

1352
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:41,570
I really love all your creativity.

1353
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:44,150
And like, all the effort you guys made into this.

1354
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:46,570
Especially like, you know, it's really hard to make a video game.

1355
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:48,610
So, it's actually so cool.

1356
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,270
Guys, thank you guys so much.

1357
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:54,090
Also, you guys are such a great fan base.

1358
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:56,430
If you guys didn't know, apparently you can still vote.

1359
01:31:56,830 --> 01:32:00,570
Apparently, the VTuber Awards voting is still ongoing.

1360
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,630
So like, oh wait, never mind, they just closed it.

1361
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:03,870
JK.

1362
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:11,870
JK, I was gonna say, vote for yourself, but they just closed it.

1363
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:13,430
So like, never mind.

1364
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:15,070
We'll see who wins then.

1365
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,950
We'll see who wins.

1366
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:19,050
Anyway guys, I'm gonna head off now.

1367
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:20,710
Thank you everybody for coming.

1368
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:22,670
As always everyone, stay hydrated.

1369
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:23,390
Posture check.

1370
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:25,010
Get up and move around and get that blood flowing.

1371
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:26,990
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

1372
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:28,310
Cause you deserve it.

1373
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:29,750
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

1374
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:31,050
Bye guys.

1375
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:31,690
Bye.
