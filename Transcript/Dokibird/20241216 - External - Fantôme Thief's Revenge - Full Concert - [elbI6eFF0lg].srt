1
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,060
It's strong together.

2
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:38,640
Before you see the two of us, we have some lovely ladies to open the show for us.

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,700
Who is gonna go first, men?

4
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,480
Who's gonna go first?

5
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,280
It is a show that is out of this world!

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,480
And that is to agree for Miss Pia!

7
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,330
Welcome, welcome, one and all!

8
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,150
Pia Pia UFO, we'll be officiating these ceremonies.

9
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,410
So please find a nice seat up here in the front.

10
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,630
You wouldn't want to miss it.

11
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,150
Panda hat guy gets it?

12
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,430
Hey Panda hat guy, you wanna be the ring boy?

13
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,130
Yes, well together, we'll be joining these two brides in the holy vows of matrimony.

14
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,970
Matrimony, wait.

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,540
Excuse me, I thought that they were gonna be on the stage.

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,520
I mean, it's their wedding, I just...

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:08,700
What?

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,760
The final act?

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,100
Captain!

20
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,940
This is their wedding invite!

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,120
There seems to have been a small programming...

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,460
Wait, cut the music, cut the music.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,860
Let's try this again.

24
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,100
Welcome, welcome, one and all, to the event of the season, Phantom Thieves!

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
Alright, now just give me a second to clean all this up.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh gosh, oh jeez, where's my manager?

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Oh god, I really screwed this one up, huh?

28
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,660
This is why you can't blindly trust people on the internet.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,640
Look, so what if I got a little de lulu about my Oshis maybe marrying each other?

30
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,560
You can't say it never happened to you!

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,680
What are you gonna do about it anyway, huh?

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,300
Sue me?

33
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,320
Oh wait, really?

34
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,060
Can I do my set first?

35
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,920
Oh, alright, well then let's get this show on the road!

36
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,920
Give me one second here.

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,040
Alright, hit it!

38
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,920

39
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:40,790

40
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:27,170

41
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,010
Do you wanna play?

42
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,910
Real game.

43
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,730
A melody that seems to cross the line.

44
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,270
I can't admit it, I can't go back, I want to forget it.

45
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,550
I'll stick it in my dream.

46
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,310
I won't be free.

47
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,930
I can see a new era.

48
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,390
To the other side of the world.

49
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,770
Let's go, new world.

50
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,250
I believe in this future.

51
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,350
If I can endure it step by step.

52
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,040
I don't have a dream.

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,640
I don't have a dream.

54
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,720
I don't have a dream.

55
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,100
Believe in me.

56
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,700
Believe in me.

57
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,940
Let's make reality colorful.

58
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,580
Music.

59
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,780
It's starting now.

60
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,500
Rising.

61
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,080
Let's close our eyes and run away together.

62
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,100
I'll show you something better than now.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
If you sing this song.

64
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,880
Do you wanna play?

65
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,760
Real game.

66
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,540
A melody that seems to cross the line.

67
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,080
I can't admit it, I can't go back, I want to forget it.

68
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,460
I'll stick it in my dream.

69
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
I won't be free.

70
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,700
I can see a new era.

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,460
To the other side of the world.

72
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,500
Let's go, new world.

73
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,980
I believe in this future.

74
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,160
If I can endure it step by step.

75
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,620
I can't admit it, I can't go back, I want to forget it.

76
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,600
I'll stick it in my dream.

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,080
To the other side of the world.

78
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,100
I believe in this future.

79
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,580
I believe in this future.

80
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,560
I'm a gremlin with a heart of gold.

81
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,780
And I wonder if some people can help me with this one.

82
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,860
Please don't ask me.

83
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,340
I'm a gremlin with a heart of gold.

84
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,280
Very, very cool.

85
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,600
Thank you very much for having me today.

86
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,480
And if that one didn't get you dancing, this next one definitely will.

87
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,320
You know, I've been practicing.

88
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,820
I've been buzzing my lips all morning for this.

89
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
But let's just jump right into it.

90
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,900
We're gonna sing...

91
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,540
Bling!

92
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,100
Bling!

93
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,220
Bling!

94
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,060
I need to change my hat.

95
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,740
I'm a gremlin with a heart of gold.

96
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:04,860
Very, very cool.

97
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,120
And if that one didn't get you dancing, this next one definitely will.

98
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm a gremlin with a heart of gold.

99
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,660
Thank you very much for having me today.

100
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:26,840
And if that one didn't get you dancing, this next one definitely will.

101
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:26,860
I've been buzzing my lips all morning for this.

102
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:26,960
But let's just jump right into it.

103
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:26,980
We're gonna sing...

104
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,000
Bling!

105
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,080
Very, very cool.

106
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,100
Thank you very much for having me today.

107
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,620
To the next, to the next.

108
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,220
To the next, to the next.

109
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,120
Now sing it.

110
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,400
To the next, to the next.

111
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,940
Well, that was a lot of Nihongo.

112
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,200
For the Nihongo, Jozu, Janai folks, why don't we put something on for them in English, I was thinking.

113
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
And since we're in a chapel, I mean, that's what a tabernacle is, right?

114
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,640
It's a chapel.

115
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,120
I was thinking, you know, chapel, chapel, tabernacle, why don't we sing some chapel row?

116
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,460
Why don't we sing some chapel row?

117
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,840
What do you miss, guys, huh?

118
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,980
Alright, sing along with me and dance it if you know it.

119
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,160
Alright.

120
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,800
Hat off.

121
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,440
Wait, no, you know what?

122
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,240
Hat on, yeah.

123
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,080
Alright, here we go.

124
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,920
Five, six, five, six, seven, eight.

125
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:41,820

134
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,260
Hot to go

You gonna OSHI me?

136
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,560
You gonna OSHI me?

137
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,480
Okay, that's enough You can cheer three You

138
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:38,970

139
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,020
But it is time for...

140
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
God knows

141
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,820
Give me all you got See, it's time for my last Everybody, you're on the break tonight

142
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:34,480
I can't do anything Even if we share the pain

143
00:16:37,640 --> 00:17:10,420
You won't forgive me Every time I live with a grudge I turn my back and leave I don't know the end I'll follow you No matter how hard the world is I'm sure you'll shine There's a future beyond

144
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:25,200
弱さゆえに魂壊されぬように My way 重なるよ今 二人に God bless

145
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:07,420
熱くなる想いは 現実 溶かして彷徨う I want to see you, but I don't have a reason.

146
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,920
You are overflowing, loving you.

147
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,500
At least, let's chase after a beautiful dream.

148
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,380
For your lonely eyes.

149
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Stop it, it's not like you to lie.

150
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,020
Look into my eyes and let's talk about the future.

151
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,000
I am prepared.

152
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,740
Even in the dark future, I will become stronger.

153
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,840
Maybe I can change my fate.

154
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,700
My wish, I want to make it come true.

155
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,780
Everything is God knows.

156
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,020
You say it, I say it.

157
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,780
The others have disappeared.

158
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,260
While drawing the beauty of a faint dream.

159
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,880
I will heal the wounds.

160
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,040
So, I will follow you.

161
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,440
No matter how painful the world is, even in the darkness.

162
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,680
Surely, you will shine.

163
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:45,540
So that my soul won't be destroyed by the weakness of the future.

164
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,140
My way overlaps now.

165
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,440
To the two of us, God bless.

166
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,820
Yeah, you are the beauty.

167
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,000
But anyways, give it up, one last round.

168
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,350
Who's the next opener?

169
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,150
Next up, be transported to a wonderful fairy tale.

170
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,090
Of honeybees and cuteness.

171
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,590
Give it up for Phoebe.

172
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,270
Hello.

173
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,410
As we say at my Phoebe High community.

174
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,830
And you can say now too, ohaji.

175
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,970
Ohaji.

176
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,330
How are you all doing tonight?

177
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,820
You will be buzzing.

178
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,940
With excitement.

179
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,500
Sorry, sorry.

180
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,820
With excitement to be here at Phantom Thieves Revenge.

181
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,720
Even though it's virtual, today is my first time performing in Georgia.

182
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,060
And I'm honestly pretty nervous.

183
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,620
Thank you for the warm welcome.

184
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:24,280
And thank you so much to Mint Toki and Ushi Spark for having me as well.

185
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,400
I was like, I was messaging backstage.

186
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,100
And I was like, oh, I'm kind of sweating here, I'm kind of nervous.

187
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,260
And then they're like, don't worry, everyone's so hyped up.

188
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,400
And then they sent me a picture of how big the crowd was.

189
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,520
And I was like, oh yeah, that's definitely going to help me feel better about this.

190
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,560
But seriously, seriously, I'm so honored to be here.

191
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,100
Thank you.

192
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm Phoebe, your 2.5D fairytale idol, singer, songwriter, and voice actor.

193
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,060
I love to write my own songs and perform them on both the virtual stage as a VTuber and the real-life stage as a real-life idol.

194
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,620
I've been working my hardest for the past several years to bridge the virtual and real-life worlds.

195
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,060
And touch as many hearts as I can all over the world with my voice, including your song.

196
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,940
Let's write our fairytale together, shall we, you guys?

197
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,500
Well, I'm an idol and it's the holiday season.

198
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,900
And so for this first song, I think a lot of you guys will kind of know what to expect.

199
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,820
Maybe, hopefully.

200
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,740
I want to make a holiday miracle of sorts happen here.

201
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,740
So if you happen to have any spare ULs lying around, I know I'm making you use your ULs so early on in the concert, I'm sorry.

202
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,720
Not sorry, but you'll know what to do when the time comes.

203
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,820
So please enjoy this first song.

204
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,660
You know it?

205
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,620
Here we go.

206
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,700
Snow Halation.

207
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:09,280
不思議だね 今の気持ち 不思議だね 今の気持ち 空から降ってきたみたい 空から降ってきたみたい

208
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,200
特別な季節の色が トキメキを見せる

209
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:35,240
初めて出会った時から 予感に騒ぐ 心のメロディー I can't stop it.

210
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,280
I can't stop it.

211
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,780
Why?

212
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,740
I can't let it go.

213
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,460
Let's get started.

214
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,900
Until our feelings overlap.

215
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,140
I can't wait.

216
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,480
It's frustrating, but it's going well.

217
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,160
In the crisis, we can't hesitate.

218
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,860
We'll take the courage to jump in.

219
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,480
It's almost time.

220
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,520
Quietly, fate.

221
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,320
The future from now on.

222
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,870
I want to run to you right away and hug you.

223
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,890
Wherever you are, wherever you are.

224
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,650
Fly high.

225
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,930
Before I knew it, I was alone.

226
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,710
This emotion has grown too big.

227
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,770
It's hard to see only dreams.

228
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,450
I want to be with you, my lover.

229
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,970
I don't want to be confused by sad dreams.

230
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,630
Let's live like this.

231
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,870
I took a deep breath.

232
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,480
Amazing.

233
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,020
Thank you so much.

234
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,780
Are we going to be able to make that holiday miracle happen?

235
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,960
Let's give it a shot, shall we?

236
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,080
From pink to what color?

237
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,220
Red.

238
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:56,980
Here we go.

239
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,010
Thank you so much, everybody.

240
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,370
And I'll give it up for my backup dancers to the B4.

241
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,990
Thank you, guys.

242
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,730
Oh my gosh, that was incredible.

243
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,370
Thank you.

244
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,290
I almost cried there.

245
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,470
So thank you so much.

246
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,210
You seriously made a Christmas miracle happen.

247
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,750
Or Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, or whatever you celebrate.

248
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,350
Speaking of miracles, Could I ask you all for a favor?

249
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,470
Can we do my idol call and response really quick?

250
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,530
If we pull this off, I think this might be the biggest crowd I've ever done my call and response with.

251
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,970
So it's real easy.

252
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,830
I'm going to ask you three questions.

253
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,970
And we're going to cheat on this test.

254
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,210
I'm going to give you the answers to them.

255
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,510
They're all just parts of my name.

256
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,590
The answers are going to be in this order.

257
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,810
C, B, and CB.

258
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:57,950
Easy, right?

259
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,390
So, shall we give it a try?

260
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,430
Here we go.

261
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,440
This is the place to...

262
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,600
Who's the bee causing all the buzz?

263
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,580
Me!

264
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,500
We've

265
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,640
got more songs to go.

266
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,920
It really means more to me than you know, though.

267
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,700
Thank you so much.

268
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,620
Hopefully, I'll be able to come to that with you all again in person one day.

269
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,980
There are some things in Atlanta that I definitely want to see one day.

270
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,400
I heard that you guys have the one and only Waffle House Museum.

271
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,340
Is that true?

272
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,460
Maybe the first time we'll be in Atlanta with you guys.

273
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,590
Penelope, to help.

274
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,530
Hi, Penelope.

275
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,310
Hello.

276
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,410
She's real good at guitar.

277
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,350
Alright.

278
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,210
Here you go.

279
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,590
Here we go.

280
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,870
You guys know this.

281
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,550
Probably.

282
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,980
Here we go.

283
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,020
You know it now, right?

284
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,640
Come on!

285
00:31:37,440 --> 00:32:09,180
The boots with the fur Shorty got the whole damn club Looking straight at her Baggy sweatpants The Reeboks with the straps Shorty turn around and give that big booty up She hit the floor and it's digging over She hit the floor and it's digging over She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

286
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,540
Shorty got a low.

287
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,660
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

288
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,860
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

289
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,100
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

290
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,380
Shorty got a low.

291
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,540
Your turn!

292
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,660
Apple bottom wet!

293
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,860
Them boots with the wet!

294
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,100
Shorty got the whole damn clump.

295
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,340
Looking straight at her.

296
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,720
Baggy sweatpants.

297
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,860
Three bucks with the straps.

298
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,100
Shorty turn around and give that big booty a slap.

299
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,200
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

300
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,800
Come on!

301
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,520
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

302
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,740
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

303
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,080
Shorty got a low.

304
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,180
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

305
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,360
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

306
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,620
She hit the floor and it's stinging over.

307
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
Shorty got a low.

308
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,580
One more time!

309
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,280
Apple bottom wet!

310
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,400
Boots with the wet!

311
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,640
Shorty got the whole damn clump.

312
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,720
Looking straight at her.

313
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,500
Yeah!

314
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,080
Shorty

315
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,830
got it just as you've known it from your childhood always, right?

316
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,160
Luckily, well, or unfortunately, I have just one more song for you.

317
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:03,020
I promise that we'll meet each other again.

318
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,740
For sure, okay?

319
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,120
Yes, we will!

320
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,730
Pinky promise, we will meet again.

321
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,350
So this is just to see you later, you know?

322
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:18,850
This next one, unlike the other covers that I've done, is an original song.

323
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,950
It is my newest original single, Your Harmony.

324
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:34,170
And it's really, really dear to my heart because I got a lot of precious VTubers, Kaigai Idol, and otake friends to sing along on it.

325
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:46,010
And a lot of the staff that worked on it as well were also really important friends that had come along with me on my journey for the past four years, four and a half years of VTubing and like five, six years of being an idol.

326
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:56,810
So, if you know it, and you know that some of you guys in the crowd do know it, please don't let's sing along to and, you know, help the others along too that might be hearing this song for the first time.

327
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:04,290
It's a song about chasing the same dreams alongside your friends and your peers, and maybe diverging along the way onto separate paths.

328
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:10,730
And despite that, you just keep cheering each other on and watching on in awe as you both accomplish amazing things.

329
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:21,330
And honestly, I'm a little sappy, but that's how I felt about Mint actually from when we both started out as VTuber sisters back in 2020 all the way up until now.

330
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,850
And she really really inspires me to this day.

331
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:32,310
So, please, please, listen to my song, Your Heart Will Go

332
00:35:51,060 --> 00:36:10,060
On.

333
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,740
Your heart will go on

334
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,140
Where did you go?

335
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:48,140
You disappeared like stars on my horizon You took off I still lie awake I gotta find it if you guys reach out and hold on I will be here for you It's weird to chase, but you keep singing for me, see?

336
00:36:48,340 --> 00:37:00,360
And if you find I'm far behind, I will make my voice and set you free Gather the sweetness I need But if you need me, I can be your harmony

337
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:31,270
Another dream that felt so real Another call, a fleeting twinkle in the twilight It's hard to stop the way I feel, clinging on too tight Where do I need to go?

338
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:59,310
I see a light that's only faintly gleaming You woke up I'm still dreaming I'm as bored as life so far, despite the calm of gravity Finding the love, the joy of life, I wanna sing it for you, see?

339
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:16,090
It's really not that we forgot, it's just the way it's meant to be Full of the past, but flying at last We're not in unison, but still in harmony If you know it, sing it with me!

340
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:57,170
I got a slightly dusty side, but I'll be climbing on the bridge If my life's made up to change, don't keep on singing for me, please And if you find I'm falling apart, baby, won't you set me free?

341
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:11,070
Another dream that felt so real, another call, a fleeting twinkle in the twilight I

342
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,730
hope you guys enjoyed Phantom Thief's Revenge.

343
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,830
Thank you!

344
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,790
Please,

345
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,350
please enjoy the rest of the night and we will meet each other again, promise.

346
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,450
Good night and bye bye!

347
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,210
I guess it's time for a final opening act.

348
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,790
Woah, getting closer and closer.

349
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,390
Who was up last, Doggie?

350
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,290
Well, someone very electrifying.

351
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,210
Woah!

352
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,710
I mean, it's only one person.

353
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,270
I mean, it's your first year, so you're the most popular.

354
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,130
Anyway, give it up for Juno Nagi!

355
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,110
Okay, Juno, it's fine.

356
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,790
Like, no one's gonna... we're not even live right now, right?

357
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,810
Like, no one's gonna see me, right?

358
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,210
Yeah, that'd be crazy if...

359
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:07,990
Oh.

360
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,400
I was definitely not throwing up, like, earlier or anything, no, but holy shit, did you guys hear the first two girls?

361
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,820
They sounded amazing!

362
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,300
They sounded so hot!

363
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,720
I love them so much, they're so, so talented and I should not be screaming because I'm actually a little sick right now.

364
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,580
But that's besides the point, right?

365
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,180
Haha, I'm still here and I'm here to give you a show.

366
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:49,120
Um, I will say, it's a little bit calmer because, you know, there has to be, like, the calm before the snow, the snow, the storm, because I don't know what Mint and Doki are up to.

367
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,360
They could be kissing right now, we would never know.

368
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,720
I will

369
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:06,300
show the course of Doki and Mint's love.

370
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,500
So, why don't we start with a breakup song?

371
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,560
I hate to give satisfaction, asking how you're doing now.

372
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,520
A house, a castle built on people you pretend to care about, just what you wanted.

373
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,600
Look at you, cool guy, you got it.

374
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:46,660
I see the parties and I'm diving, sometimes when I close my eyes, six months of torture you sold.

375
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,620
A self-forbidden paradise, I love you truly.

376
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,360
Gotta laugh at the stupidity.

377
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,820
Cause I've made some real big mistakes, but you make the worst ones look fine.

378
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:07,700
I should've known it was strange, you only come out at night.

379
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:14,580
I used to think I was smart, but you made me look so naive.

380
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:22,400
The way you sold me for gold, you suck your teeth into me.

381
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:30,740
Sucker, big fucker, bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire.

382
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:39,030
I never talked to you, told me you were bad, bad news, you called them crazy.

383
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,510
Gotta hate the way I called them crazy too, you're so convincing.

384
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,010
How do I lie with all the foolish?

385
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:51,790
What a mess where I can paralyze you, fuck up little girl.

386
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,430
You can't figure out just how you do it, and I know they never will.

387
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,700
She deserves your age, no better.

388
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,860
I've made some real big mistakes,

389
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,440
but you didn't know it was strange.

390
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,040
You only

391
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:24,910
come out at night.

392
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,450
You suck your teeth into me.

393
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:36,830
Sucker, big fucker, bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire.

394
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,310
You said it was too long, I wouldn't let me hide.

395
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,650
You can't love anyone, cause that would mean you had a heart.

396
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,350
I try to help you out, I know that I can't.

397
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,490
Cause cause you think the kind of thing you'll never understand.

398
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,390
I...

399
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:10,050
I've made some real big mistakes, but you didn't know it was strange.

400
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,890
You only come out at night.

401
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:23,390
You suck your teeth into me.

402
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,920
Sucker, big fucker, bleeding

403
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:55,820
me dry like a goddamn vampire.

404
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,400
That was crazy, wow, I really hit the notes, huh?

405
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,280
Yeah.

406
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,640
Forgot to mention this first, I saw someone recording the concert with 3DS.

407
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,940
Do you know how much 3DSs cost?

408
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,610
Well, you know what you do with 3DSs?

409
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,830
You play them with the homies.

410
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,090
You play Mario Kart with the homies, you make enemies.

411
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,790
But like, don't you have to kiss afterwards?

412
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,810
You gotta make up with your homies, right?

413
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,630
You got four kinds of homies, and this sucks.

414
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:45,630
So, I'm gonna tell you right now, if you know the lyrics to this next song, that it holds...

415
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,390
I hold it very close to my heart, actually.

416
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:54,050
So if you would sing along with me, I really appreciate that.

417
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,130
Let's go!

418
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:18,020
It was just two brothers, fucking on a guy, rubbing on his ass, picking up each other.

419
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,780
See it in your eyes, I'm gonna make you cry, underneath the cover.

420
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:22,780
I

421
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,260
don't...

422
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,340
Bitch, I...

423
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,150
Don't want my lies, running through my rubber.

424
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,050
Can you let me die, or I'm gonna blast, I got semen powers.

425
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:24,870
Fuck you in the shower.

426
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,750
Are you gonna hug a homie tonight?

427
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,270
Are you gonna tell them that you love them?

428
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,690
Look, you guys have to tell each other that you love each other.

429
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,790
You have to...

430
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,140
I'm just like, on your spare time, not in front of me.

431
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,320
Well, do you guys like that one?

432
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,420
I hope you did.

433
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:14,900
But yeah, so that was like, you know, the first song was about a breakup, the second song is about making up.

434
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,680
What could the third song be about?

435
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,080
No, you're wrong.

436
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,000
It's about being in a happy, healthy relationship, obviously.

437
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,200
I... the next one is... I wrote the English lyrics for it.

438
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,160
It's just a cover, but...

439
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,380
I hope you guys like it.

440
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,460
It's pretty smooth, slow, and I hope you dance along with me.

441
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:16,880
Let's go!

442
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:36,600
You and me, shimmering, I'm just feeling the break inside You and I, shimmering, all my fears I try to hide You and I, let's carry on, never wake from drunken wine Is it a monster, baby?

443
00:51:37,160 --> 00:52:00,380
Shady light, mellow beat, voices that just never stop Days are worn red, center fading, gone by Cherry wine, pillow kiss, hear the voice inside me now I just want to bite a chip of you, so much rain La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

444
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:27,940
Took all my hand in magic ways Lost my meaning, knowing everything is wrong In my youth, I ran away from the cause The kick from the sound, the voice so loud Trying to help me Check your white, yellow page What's this now?

445
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:40,660
We'll never know In the end, the sky fades Yet you're smiling Telling me you'll never stray Check your white, yellow kiss Hear the voice inside me now When it melts

446
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,960
White, yellow page What's this now?

447
00:52:47,020 --> 00:53:10,020
Just never stop There's a word written A fading gone by Telling me you'll never stray Check your white, yellow kiss Hear the voice inside me now I just want To find a shade for you Too much rain Late at night Oh, so bright Illuminate Too much rain Late at night Oh,

448
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:18,200
so bright Turn away Too much rain I

449
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,280
think that was a pretty good song.

450
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,140
You know, after the whole guys fucking each other it was pretty calm, right?

451
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,550
Well, I'm glad you guys enjoyed the list so far.

452
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:49,270
You see, the last song I can't really say it's about a healthy relationship because I think someone dies at the end of the song so I don't think that's really good.

453
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:53,690
I don't think anyone should just stop living, so...

454
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,150
Well...

455
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,430
Oh my god, this is...

456
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,910
Oh my god, wait, hold on, I need a...

457
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,370
Oh, it's almost over.

458
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,410
You got this, you got this.

459
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:02,850
It's fine.

460
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,050
It's almost done.

461
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,030
It might be the end of this thing.

462
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,330
I screamed afterwards.

463
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:16,150
Well, it's coming to an end so are you ready for my original song, Pull the Trigger?

464
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,080
Goodbye.

465
00:54:38,210 --> 00:55:11,050
So I'm a faker, a traitor A pathetic love chaser A cheap simitator An overdramatic instigator Summer blaze fades in my veins All of them gone without a trace I got a hunch you'd feel safer When cowering in envy with her And I can't hide And I already won Cause you're comfortable in your own misery You're temperable dirt and toxicity And tonight I'm letting go of the hold you have on me Now pull the trigger if you dare I'll laugh it away,

466
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:22,690
I'll laugh it away But take the vengeance in the air I'll defy what you say, I'll prove that I care Take one look at me, I'll be my mentor Marie Baby I know I'm meant to be You'll love me eternally

467
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:50,290
I'm here to fight for self-righteousness And spitefulness When you're out broken, tied on mess I'll convalesce your life in this shadow By my ardor and success I've broken all the ways up to the highest I'm the salt of the fall I can be the lowest, the lowest of the low Yeah,

468
00:55:50,310 --> 00:56:07,470
you're shocked that I left you out all alone And I've got money and time And I already won Cause you follow the words of a hypocrite Like a sheep in a herd, and I'm sick of it And the highlight of my night Is watching the road I've so unfit Pull the trigger,

469
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:21,290
shoot me dead I can't get away, can't get away Contrive an ending in your head Faulty in your day, leave you in a daze There, as I succeed You know you're nothing without me Maybe you're just blind and you're happy Tell me one more time, cause this shit's a gig

470
00:56:49,980 --> 00:57:14,720
Walking the hallway with you, baby The joys, the laughs, the memories Nothing I could do Nothing left to prove Everyone's eyes watching you Pull the trigger if you dare I'll love the way, I'll love the way That takes up everything in the air Take one look at me A real moment,

471
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:36,860
don't worry Baby, I know who I'm meant to be You'll remember me eternally The final slide tonight As it's for the third time in your life You're all I ever should I hope for you to be right So take one more look at me And let's fight all the time This isn't who you were meant to be We're just a little bit of a jealousy We only know what's on we Pull the trigger once again

472
00:57:53,030 --> 00:58:00,470
Oh my god, thank you so much for having me here It was such a wonderful experience You guys are just amazing I

473
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:13,050
also have to say, before I go The cameraman was zooming in to the guy with the 3DS I can't, that made me fucking laugh I'm so sorry Thank

474
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,200
you so much Thank you so much

475
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:59,070

480
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:46,500

481
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,080
It's basically Overwatch 2

482
00:59:52,820 --> 01:00:07,020
And the crowd goes wild Oh my god Look at those heels Oh, I'm dancing This is what the dance lessons were for, guys Right here, I'm gonna dance now What do we actually have to do?

All right.

517
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,180
Remember, all you need to know is just be shy.

518
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:33,880
That's right.

519
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,200

520
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,640
Embracing everything.

From here to

524
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:52,490
vacation.

525
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,570
Well, the stamina of a streamer has the power.

526
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:55,270
The whole nation.

527
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,230
With slower rhythms.

528
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:56,730
I know.

529
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:57,910
It's an extraordinary panel.

530
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,470
And shows up at the stars loud.

531
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,230
Donkey Man.

532
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:00,890
Donkey Man.

533
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,070
Hey, they all know that I run the show.

534
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:03,870
I'm a real gamer.

535
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:04,850
I'm a sexy baby.

536
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:05,430
No, I'm not.

537
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,110
You're telling lies again.

538
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,490
No way.

539
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,350
I said what I said.

540
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,170
But you're wrong.

541
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:09,770
No, I'm not.

542
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,170
Which one am I?

543
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:11,930
The real star.

544
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,450
Well, they show to me obviously.

546
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:16,110
I know.

547
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,270
They're talking about me.

548
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:19,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

549
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,070
I told you they don't talk to their queen.

550
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:22,830
Oh, people talk to the real star.

551
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,590
They're shouting at me.

553
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:26,530
Everything I feel.

554
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:27,410
I can't trust myself.

555
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:27,910
I know.

556
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

557
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,230
Do you think you're something?

558
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,510
What is this all becoming?

559
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:33,690
Just wait.

560
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:34,290
Hmm.

561
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,030
Just wait.

562
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:35,450
Hmm.

563
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:36,390
Just wait.

564
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:36,790
Hmm.

565
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:37,990
Try another time.

566
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,270
Well, yes, that's fine.

567
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:41,270
Everything's gonna be okay, though, in the end.

568
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:41,830
All right.

569
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,610
And there won't be anything to think about.

570
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:44,590
That's right.

571
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:45,110
Almost.

572
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:45,930
Almost.

573
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:46,450
Tonight.

574
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,150
Just watch.

575
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,950
You're only doing this for the fun of it, though.

576
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:49,630
It's fine.

577
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:50,170
It's fine.

578
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,870
Do your best with everything you've got.

579
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:52,470
All right.

580
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,590
Although the rules are pretty strange, you've got a shot.

581
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,170
That's right.

582
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,930
So start.

583
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:56,530
We'll see.

584
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:57,990
Embracing everything.

585
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:01,110
You will not dance with us tonight.

586
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,310
It is not a time for words while I'm hanging for your very eyes.

587
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:04,630
And?

588
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:05,910
And a ballad for all my madness.

589
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:07,070
Very sad, very hard.

590
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:07,350
Hmm.

591
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,410
You stole a super, though.

592
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:08,770
Really?

593
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:09,130
It's funny.

594
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,190
Wish you'd probably stop.

595
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:11,190
Can you hear me singing?

596
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,430
Okay.

597
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:11,990
A ballad.

598
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:12,310
Stop.

599
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:12,970
To me.

600
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:13,970
Yes, everyone.

601
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:15,430
This is the song you want to sing.

602
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,150
Do you hear her?

603
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,490
Oh, what a voice.

604
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,130
Oh, look at her go.

605
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,570
I'm not ready to sing.

606
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,450
Oh, she really is.

607
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:20,790
I'm frightened.

608
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:23,430
I'm sorry.

609
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:26,470
Oh, oh.

610
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:27,430
Oh.

611
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:28,870
Oh.

612
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:29,850
But she's our one.

613
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:32,630
Oh.

614
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:33,370
Oh, we're so much for

615
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:45,480
that.

616
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,680
Oh, we're sure, always.

617
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:48,560
Always.

618
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,800
We're tied together half the time.

619
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,020
So really dance, dance.

620
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:51,300
Dance.

621
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:51,900
Dance.

622
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,360
Dance.

623
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,760
Dance.

624
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,540
Together.

625
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,040
Together.

626
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,460
Get it.

627
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:01,560
Dance.

628
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:01,660
Dance.

629
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,820
We want to say thanks for your hard work every day.

630
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,700
We're not going to complain

631
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,340
when we do.

632
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,460
And watch over us till the day we do.

633
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:41,410
You guys are like, who is it right now?

634
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,770
It's okay, you're doing great.

635
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,310
Everybody, don't be too crazy.

636
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:55,840
It's all live.

637
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,240
That's when you know.

638
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,480
Because it's not perfect.

639
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,400
That's when you know.

640
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,640
Don't you worry, we're in Atlanta.

641
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:08,940
Watch this.

642
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,020
Oh, it's the Waffle House.

643
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:10,340
Yeah!

644
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,100
That's when you know it's the Waffle House.

645
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,760
We're not responsible for the Waffle House.

646
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:37,750
I fell out.

647
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:38,790
I'm disintegrated.

648
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:43,750
We hope you like our first song of the day.

649
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:44,550
Yeah, the very first.

650
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:48,470
Oh, and thank you, of course, to our wonderful opening act, Jun!

651
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,910
Wherever you are, up there in the 2D.

652
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:56,790
In the digital space.

653
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,310
In the 2D plane.

654
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:58,830
Yeah.

655
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:00,790
What else?

656
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,330
Oh gosh, I'm nervous.

657
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,530
I'm just tired.

658
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:04,610
I'm already tired.

659
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:05,750
I don't have...

660
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,490
Oh, I want to do something.

661
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:10,770
What?

662
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:11,290
What is it?

663
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:12,490
Whisps!

664
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:13,270
Yeah!

665
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,240
Alright, come out there.

666
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,340
You don't even have hands.

667
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,660
Come on, Dragoons!

668
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,800
Give me a cheer!

669
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,140
Hey,

670
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:42,460
Brooke, okay?

671
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,700
Alright, thank you all.

672
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,400
Thank you.

673
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,360
Thank you all for coming.

674
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,900
We're going to love today's show.

675
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,600
The set list is amazing.

676
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,340
Oh boy.

677
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:54,800
Yeah.

678
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:05,130
This is not a regular VTuber concert, let's just say.

679
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:08,410
If you've gone to a lot of VTuber concerts, this one's different.

680
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,910
Alright, well, let's go get ready.

681
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,490
Who's going to be first?

682
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:15,770
Who's going to be first?

683
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,450
Yeah, her or me.

684
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:17,990
Or both.

685
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,350
We're going to find out.

686
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:19,830
We'll see.

687
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,590
We'll see you guys soon.

688
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:22,850
See you guys soon!

01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:57,720
I hope you guys have been super hyped right now in Atlanta for this special occasion.

704
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,980
I'm so happy to be here.

705
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,320
I found a new movie and everything.

706
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:01,900
I'm following you.

707
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:14,740
I assume that's how it goes.

708
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,760
Anyway, stay hyped.

709
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,120
We have a whole entire set list left.

710
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,200
So we'll see you for the next song, everybody!

711
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,020
Music in 1240.

712
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:40,130
Do me!

713
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:40,410
Do me!

714
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,670
Go!

715
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,940
Do me!

716
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,020
Do me!

717
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:23,020
Go!

718
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:47,940
Do me!

719
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,540
Do me!

720
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,040
Go!

721
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:16,140
Do me!

722
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:18,840
Do me!

723
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:19,620
Go!

724
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,060
I'm puzzled.

725
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:25,740
I'm

726
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,020
confused.

727
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,300
I'm troubled.

728
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:41,940
I love you.

729
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,340
I love you, but...

730
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,140
What should I do?

731
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,400
I don't care if I'm a girl or a boy.

732
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:02,260
But, but, but...

733
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:05,920
Triangle, triangle love.

734
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:12,860
In an instant, in an instant, the balance breaks.

735
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:16,460
I'm following the rhythm of a normal love.

736
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,560
I'm a normal girl, but I'm a little over the top.

737
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,900
Triangle, triangle love.

738
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:32,720
Just kidding, just kidding.

739
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:33,360
If

740
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:44,480
I fall in love, I'll break down.

741
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:50,380
If I fall in love, I'll break down.

742
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:21,890
It's just one of those days, feel like a break trend.

743
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,630
First one to complain leaves with a blood stain.

744
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:26,090
Damn right, I'm a maniac.

745
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:28,830
You better watch your back, cause I'm fucking up your program.

746
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:31,730
And if you're stuck up, you just lucked up.

747
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:35,590
Next in line to get fucked up, your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!

748
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:37,670
It's just one of those days.

749
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:40,390
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

750
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:44,470
I think you better quit, let shit slip.

751
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,370
Or you'll be living with a fat lip.

752
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:49,110
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

753
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:53,250
I think you better quit talking that shit.

754
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,450
So come and get it.

755
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:57,050
I feel like shit.

756
01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:00,430
My suggestion is to keep your distance.

757
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,390
Cause right now I'm dangerous.

758
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:05,450
We've all felt like shit.

759
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:07,110
And been treated like shit.

760
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:11,270
All those motherfuckers that want to step up.

761
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,510
Hopping up like a chainsaw.

762
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,570
I'll skin your ass raw.

763
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:18,290
And if my day keeps going this way.

764
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:20,470
I just might break something tonight.

765
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,170
Hopping up like a chainsaw.

766
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:24,250
I'll skin your ass raw.

767
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,010
And if my day keeps going this way.

768
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:29,270
I just might break something tonight.

769
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,110
Hopping up like a chainsaw.

770
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:33,070
I'll skin your ass raw.

771
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:38,440
I just might break your fucking face tonight.

772
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:44,760
Give me something to break.

773
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:07,670
He says bullshit.

774
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,650
Or you'll be living with a fat lip.

775
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:14,790
It's all about the

776
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:19,400
heat.

777
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,480
Talking like shit.

778
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,600
So come and get it.

779
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,150
This time...

780
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:18,920
I was trying to do barebone.

781
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:21,280
But my favorite idol group is Nicki Minaj and Kiss the Door.

782
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:22,650
And then of course...

783
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,360
Break stuff.

784
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:24,980
Yeah!

785
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,520
Um... uh... uh...

786
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,600
Oh wait, I forgot everything that I was going to say.

787
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,180
Um...

788
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:53,700
I'll make you guys

789
01:29:58,810 --> 01:29:59,150
sing.

790
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:00,670
And show you all.

791
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,310
So it's very exciting.

792
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:03,730
Keep saying hi.

793
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:06,450
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

794
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:17,150
Well, my first time doing a full 3D show.

795
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:19,110
I miss all of you so much.

796
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:22,510
I didn't

797
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:27,170
hear any of that.

798
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,230
She hates us.

799
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:29,910
Did you hear all that nonsense?

800
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:49,430
You're not watching, right?

801
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,520
Where'd it go?

802
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:54,980
I don't know.

803
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,400
Okay, anyway.

804
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,160
We're still on the show!

805
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:25,600
Someday, we'll have a 3D show.

806
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:06,980
One day, it could be over.

807
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:22,030
Again and again.

808
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:25,070
All the memories of you and

809
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:28,300
I.

810
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,880
Lost in the wind.

811
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:04,440
Drink the last cup of coffee.

812
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,280
With a smile.

813
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:09,720
Drink

814
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,260
the last cup of coffee.

815
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,040
With a smile.

816
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:38,720
We're forced to unplay the same songs we've known since that day.

817
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,900
Imposter took our life away.

818
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,480
Now we're stuck here to decay.

819
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,080
Please let us get in.

820
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,220
Don't let us run away.

821
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:47,960
We're not like what you think we are.

822
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,600
We work for those songs.

823
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,740
We don't want no self-control.

824
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,940
And we're forced to take that role.

825
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,120
We've been alone.

826
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,440
A few mellow songs.

827
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:56,900
It drives me mad.

828
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,860
Join us, be a friend.

829
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,120
Or just keep on getting fed.

830
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:04,120
You're the only girl I like at Freddy's.

831
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,980
Is this where you wanna be?

832
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,980
I just don't get it.

833
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:12,960
Why do you wanna spend my nights at Freddy's?

834
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,260
Is this where you wanna be?

835
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:18,260
I just don't get it.

836
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:21,260
Why do you wanna spend my nights at Freddy's?

837
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:44,000
Like, surprise, we get to see you another night.

838
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,320
You should have looked for another job.

839
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,740
You should have said to this place goodbye.

840
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,880
It's like there's so much more.

841
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,240
Maybe you've been in this place before.

842
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,620
You remember a face like yours.

843
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:58,160
You seem acquainted with the stores.

844
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,540
Please let us get in.

845
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:00,760
Don't let us run away.

846
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,920
We're not like what you think we are.

847
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,300
We're poor little souls who have lost all control.

848
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:07,340
And we're forced here to take that role.

849
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:11,520
We've been all alone, stuck in our own show since 1987.

850
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,440
Join us, be a friend.

851
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,640
Or just keep on getting fed.

852
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:17,920
You're the only girl I like at Freddy's.

853
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,560
Is this where you wanna be?

854
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:22,920
I just don't get it.

855
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:26,920
Why do you wanna spend my nights at Freddy's?

856
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:29,840
Is this where you wanna be?

857
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,920
I just don't get it.

858
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,320
Why do you wanna stay?

859
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:18,090
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

860
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,860
How bad can I be?

861
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,120
I'm just following my destiny.

862
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:23,760
How?

863
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:28,190
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

864
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:30,690
How bad can I be?

865
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:32,810
How bad can I possibly be?

866
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:34,670
What's the principle of nature?

867
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:37,870
The animals and the creature knows.

868
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:40,730
Cause survival of the fittest.

869
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:41,910
We're checking this out.

870
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:47,670
The animal that wins, gotta scratch and bite and claw and bite and punch.

871
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:53,130
And the animal that doesn't, well the animal that doesn't, well it's up someone else's...

872
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:55,250
L-L-L-L-Lunch.

873
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:57,190
Munch, munch, munch, munch, munch.

874
01:37:57,610 --> 01:38:00,150
How bad can I be?

875
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:02,170
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

876
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:05,070
How bad can I be?

877
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:07,190
I'm just following my destiny.

878
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:09,910
How bad can I be?

879
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:12,350
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

880
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:14,790
How bad can I be?

881
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,890
How bad can I possibly be?

882
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,890
There's a principle of business.

883
01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:19,930
A principle of business.

884
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,770
It's what you know is the sound.

885
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:23,570
And there's a people of the melody.

886
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:24,710
People of the melody.

887
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:26,430
Because every living world's around.

888
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:28,450
So I'm figuring my company.

889
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:29,690
I'm figuring my factory.

890
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:31,230
I'm figuring my corporate side.

891
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:35,190
Figuring, figuring, figuring, figuring, figuring out where you take care of yours and me.

892
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:39,070
I'll take care of my, my, my, my, my.

893
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:41,210
I mean, let's shake that bottom line.

894
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:43,170
Let me hear you say, smart as gold.

895
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:44,430
Smart as gold.

896
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:45,570
Slippery slide.

897
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:46,790
Sloppily slide.

898
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:47,970
Complain all you want.

899
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:50,110
It's never ever gonna stop.

900
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:52,010
Come on.

901
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:54,050
How bad can I possibly be?

902
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:56,410
How bad can I be?

903
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:58,310
I'm just doing the economy.

904
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:01,310
How bad can I be?

905
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:03,690
Just look at me petting this puppy.

906
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:06,210
How bad can I be?

907
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:08,730
A portion of proof needs girls to share.

908
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,090
How bad can I be?

909
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:13,110
How bad can I possibly be?

910
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:13,690
Let's see.

911
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:16,030
How bad can I be?

912
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:18,190
All the customers are buying.

913
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:20,950
How bad can I be?

914
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:22,670
And the money's multiplying.

915
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:25,810
How bad can I be?

916
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:27,910
And the PR people are lying.

917
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:30,650
How bad can I be?

918
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:32,770
And the lawyers are denying.

919
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:35,490
How bad can I be?

920
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:37,870
Who cares if a few trees are dying.

921
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:40,350
How bad can I be?

922
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:42,710
This is all so gratifying.

923
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:44,510
How bad.

924
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:48,930
How bad can this possibly be?

925
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,300
I want to be the top.

926
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,420
I'm getting used to it.

927
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,420
This is different from peace.

928
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,440
I'm a number one star.

929
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,040
I'm being swayed.

930
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,100
There's nothing I can't lose.

931
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:17,710
I'm number one.

932
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,680
The

933
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:13,080
only thing that can keep us going is...

934
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,120
us, us.

935
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,080
Let's have fun.

936
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,760
Q.E.D.

937
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:20,440
My name is Sugar-san.

938
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:22,060
Everyone, jump out!

939
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,420
I'll come back to life.

940
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,520
I'll show it to you.

941
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,160
The truth is...

942
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,700
I'm going crazy.

943
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,700
I'll keep surprising the world.

944
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:35,080
My name is Sugar-san.

945
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:36,660
Everyone, jump out!

946
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,220
It's sweet and bitter.

947
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,740
My eyes are spinning.

948
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,520
Sugar-san.

949
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:41,420
Make some noise.

950
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:42,880
Let's have a party.

951
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:45,800
Let's go crazy all over the world.

952
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:49,580
On a night like this, I feel good.

953
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,940
No matter what happens, my collection goes on.

954
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:52,640
Let's go.

955
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,040
Let's go together.

Q.E.D.

960
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:08,890
Q.E.D.

961
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:09,410
Q.E.D.

962
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:39,780
Q.E.D.

963
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:49,750
Q.E.D.

Q.E.D.

965
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:42,700
Let me make it come true.

this, I feel good.

974
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:11,790

Don't get lost.

978
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:19,310
Put on your shoes.

979
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:20,570
Let's go out.

980
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:23,330

Don't worry.

982
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:27,350
I'm not alone.

983
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:29,710

Fly high!

991
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,770
I hope we can reach that town.

992
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,810
Shout out!

993
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:16,210
Our future is full of dreams.

994
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:19,490
Fly more.

995
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:25,590
If you are here, everyone will smile again.

996
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:48,430
Even when I grow up, I won't forget you.

997
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:55,550
Our precious memories will last forever.

998
01:50:57,630 --> 01:51:03,610
Ah, in my heart, there is a dream that will shine forever.

999
01:51:05,390 --> 01:51:06,330
Try one.

01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:21,890
Fly more.

1004
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:28,370
Let me make it overflow with dreams all over the world.

1005
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:35,450
It's

1006
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:22,030
starting to change, isn't

1007
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:27,020
it?

1008
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:29,840
The world is

1009
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:44,420
a mystery.

1010
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,020
I'm sure there's a place to enjoy.

1011
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:40,980
The world is always there.

1012
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:43,240
There is a dirty world.

1013
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,220
Shock shock.

1014
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:47,720
It's reflected in the window.

1015
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,340
Shock shock.

1016
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:50,730
It's a dangerous light.

1017
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:52,720
It's a star that disappears.

1018
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:54,360
It's a star that passes by.

1019
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:57,780
Sailors, let's go!

1020
01:53:58,020 --> 01:53:59,460
Sailors, let's go!

1021
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:00,480
I'm going to dance.

1022
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:39,910
Is that what we're going to do?

1023
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:44,020
That Don Quijote.

1024
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:45,940
One of us was lying.

1025
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:47,340
Who is it?

1026
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:49,960
When

1027
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:10,220
you hear the song, you'll know who picked the song.

1028
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,440
She agreed to it.

1029
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,060
She said no.

1030
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:18,440
That was true, and also our long-awaited guests.

1031
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:18,940
Yay!

1032
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:42,090
She can be my wife.

1033
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:42,710
That good?

1034
02:00:42,870 --> 02:00:44,590
The best 30 seconds of my life.

1035
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:47,410
I'm so humbled by your girls' ability to let me do it.

1036
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:53,150
Cause honestly, I'd expect more from a girl who's better.

1037
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:56,010
Cause she let me wear her chain and my turtleneck sweater.

1038
02:00:56,130 --> 02:01:01,650
So this was dedicated to the girls that let us fuck around on top of them.

1039
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:02,010
Yeah!

1040
02:01:02,370 --> 02:01:04,650
We're a bar where the sugar told me.

1041
02:01:04,650 --> 02:01:05,010
Yeah!

1042
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:07,450
We can't feel at all or let it get funky.

1043
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:08,890
She can hook me on the watch.

1044
02:01:09,070 --> 02:01:10,310
Doesn't matter how tense.

1045
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:11,790
But I cried the whole time.

1046
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:13,090
Doesn't matter how tense.

1047
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:14,650
She might have been a racist.

1048
02:01:14,730 --> 02:01:15,850
Doesn't matter how tense.

1049
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:17,470
She put a bag on my head.

1050
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:19,850
Still, girl, I just had sex.

1051
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:20,850
Sex!

1052
02:01:21,390 --> 02:01:23,630
And the dreams came true.

1053
02:01:23,930 --> 02:01:25,050
The dreams came true.

1054
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:27,510
She didn't have to dance in the last 30 minutes.

1055
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:29,410
And it was the right thing to do with me.

1056
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:31,730
I just had sex.

1057
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:34,850
And it felt so good.

1058
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:30,040
Guys, we hope you guys get lucky.

1059
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:30,660
Woo!

1060
02:05:45,970 --> 02:05:48,770
Oh yeah!

1061
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:49,810
Oh yeah!

1062
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:09,830
I'm so proud of you.

1063
02:06:10,210 --> 02:06:11,530
So, here's to the beginning.

1064
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:13,670
Always have to make your dreams come true.

1065
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:15,130
Go with the flow.

1066
02:06:15,190 --> 02:06:17,470
Moonshine skip and jump step on the floor.

1067
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:20,830
You are invited to the journey to the best of one.

1068
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:21,590
Let's get started!

1069
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:22,870
Take me, 나 시달러니.

1070
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:24,490
내가 내가 내가, please guide my mind.

1071
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:25,350
맘여라, 와라와.

1072
02:06:25,450 --> 02:06:26,190
맘마라, 봐, 하기를.

1073
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:28,590
나 와있구나, 봐, 지금 봐, 두리번, 나쒀, 하이!

1074
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:29,630
돈이 널 낳을까?

1075
02:06:29,630 --> 02:06:30,690
This is the second sentence.

1076
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:31,650
And this is the third one.

1077
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:34,770
Let's go!

1078
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:02,570
Oh yeah!

1079
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:03,610
Oh yeah!

1080
02:07:05,190 --> 02:07:05,710
Oh yeah!

1081
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:08,370
Shake, shake, go on, there's never an end in sight.

1082
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:12,090
It's alright, side by side, all our dreaming is fine.

1083
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:13,270
Oh yeah!

1084
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:16,450
Go on, open the ground and run, so hurry up.

1085
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:16,870
Oh yeah!

1086
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:18,370
Oh yeah!

1087
02:07:20,410 --> 02:07:35,170
Hito shi kiri yo tori, hitori kiri no toki no ku, haku wo umukatto mata pisu wa rama, yoso ijou ni omoidori ni, kanari mo, kitto, kono buki asu darou ne.

1088
02:07:35,570 --> 02:07:38,110
Dance, dance, I see the twinkles in your eyes.

1089
02:07:38,130 --> 02:07:40,390
All of the twinkling in your eyes.

1090
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:41,830
The shining bright.

1091
02:07:42,490 --> 02:07:44,370
Shake, shake, go on, there's never an end in sight.

1092
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:49,510
Mirai mo hanetai sachi, life no shinari wa bokura shinai madai.

1093
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:52,170
Asa narai you ni mahou kagayou, hands up, let's go!

1094
02:07:52,310 --> 02:08:04,010
Tsukeridashita senbonzakuri, hana yoru wo aseru, yotsu wo umau, toki no kanari kara, owase kara, babamizu no machikara, kanarizu no magikara, uma no nai hodo ni, what's the fun in that?

1095
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:07,890
Dance, dance, I see the twinkles in your eyes.

1096
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:09,390
All of the twinkling in your eyes.

1097
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:09,770
The shining bright.

1098
02:08:09,990 --> 02:08:10,570
Shake, shake, go

1099
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:51,320
on, there's never an

1100
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,400
end in sight.

1101
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:40,710
Thank you guys for coming.

1102
02:10:51,150 --> 02:10:52,890
Thank you and have a great rest of your weekend!
