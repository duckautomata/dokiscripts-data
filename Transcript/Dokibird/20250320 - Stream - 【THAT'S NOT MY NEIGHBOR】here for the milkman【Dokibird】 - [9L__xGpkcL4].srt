00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,060
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm sorry for being late!

3
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,860
Hello!

4
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,340
Hello!

5
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,640
Oh my god, I hate being late.

6
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm so sorry.

7
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,600
I always... I hate being late.

8
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm really sorry guys, because you gave up your personal time to like, make sure I start on time.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,580
And today I didn't start on time.

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm really, really sorry guys.

11
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,540
Um, I've been doing a lot... I've been going outside a lot.

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,760
Um, the last... Okay, a lot as in like the last...

13
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,720
Yesterday and today.

14
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,320
Yesterday and today, um, I have to go outside to do some errands.

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,480
Um, because, uh, I'm finally well enough to actually go outside.

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
Other than walking my dog.

17
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,780
Because, uh, you guys didn't know.

18
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,860
You guys didn't know.

19
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,820
I've been like, sick the last, uh, couple of months.

20
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,540
And I've been like, back-to-back-to-back sick.

21
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,780
And because I've been like, back-to-back-to-back sick, I haven't been able to do a lot of errands that I need to do that require me to go out.

22
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,500
More than just walking my dog.

23
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,820
So, the last two days, I've been catching up on like, going to the bank, um, buying some things that I needed to buy.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Regarding like, work-related stuff.

25
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,920
Doing work... Doing work-related things that I had to do that required me to go outside.

26
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,480
Um, so, but today, I sort of, like, came home, uh, late.

27
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,380
Because I woke up late.

28
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,080
But I still had to do my errands today.

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,340
So, like, even though, like, I woke up late, I still had to go out, uh, and like, do things I had to do.

30
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,620
Oh, fuck, okay.

31
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm sad.

32
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,900
Okay, so, wait, let me double-check if this is a thing that's- if this is a store that's worldwide.

33
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,480
Before I accidentally, like, dox my-my, like, city or something.

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,180
I need to know.

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:50,340
Is this, like, okay, uh, let me- I just need to know, like, how many stores are there of this particular- Okay, okay, um...

36
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Okay, okay, that's cool.

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,880
Okay, it's all around Canada.

38
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,860
Okay, that's cool.

39
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,420
Anyway!

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,180
So, I was getting some prints made.

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,040
I was also, like, testing some prints out.

42
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,680
And this was for, like, uh, this was for, like, the, uh, charity.

43
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,140
Uh, this was for, like, the charity auction from last year.

44
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,880
So, I'm sending extra-sized prints to everybody that, uh, won prints from me.

45
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,680
And I was testing out London Drugs, uh, just to be, like- I'm also getting them made at another print store.

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,680
But I wanted to see if London Drugs have, like, uh, good quality, uh, prints as well.

47
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,180
So, uh, but the thing is, I'm also getting it done by a local- a local print shop as well.

48
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,180
But I wanted to see- because, like, London Drugs is fast, so I was testing it out as well.

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,820
So, I was picking that up today, too.

50
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,980
Um, London Drugs- yes, I know.

51
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,660
It's a- basically, like, a retail pharmacy store.

52
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,960
So, you can- you know, like, I don't know the equivalent of that in America.

53
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:00,540
Uh, but it's, like, a little- it's, like, a pharmacy store, but it has, like, compu- you can buy, like, uh, everything- you can buy anything there.

54
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,700
Um, like, basically, it has everything.

55
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,140
And I didn't realize on the back side of the print, it just says, London Drugs.

56
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,480
What?

57
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,920
Yeah, it's like a- oh, okay, yeah, it's like CVS Walgreens.

58
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,980
So, on the back side of these prints, it says, London Drugs!

59
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,460
Photo Lab!

60
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,880
Go to our website to get more photos!

61
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:31,040
And I was like, okay, I'm not- I'll send the- whoever gets these ones, I'll give you guys these for- I'm gonna give those for free.

62
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:40,660
But, like, I'm not gonna do this for the- I don't know, I don't know if the other- maybe I'll do it, I'll just be like, sorry about that, I was testing out different print stores.

63
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,960
And- So, I'll give these out for free.

64
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,340
So, yeah, it's, like, the first one's free, guys.

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,360
It literally gives, like, the website's like, visit www.londondrugs.com.

66
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,680
And I'm like, aw, that sucks.

67
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,660
I'm like, aw, why does it- why do that?

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,500
They're really nice quality, too, I'm really sad.

69
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,380
These are actually really nice quality, and I'm like, aw.

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,860
Only it doesn't say, go to London Drugs to get more photos done.

71
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:36,040
But, yeah, so, yeah, I've been, like, I've just been- I'm making, like, additional prints for those who won the charity auctions for the prints and stuff.

72
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,180
And everything, and just cause, like, different sizes of them.

73
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,380
So, just to be like, sorry it took so long and everything.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,680
Also shipped out more postcards today.

75
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,460
And everything.

76
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,260
Also, psychos, thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

77
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm glad that Kony died and cleared up your sickness and you're able to go outside and touch grass now.

78
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,800
Thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

79
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,820
Uh, lollipop, thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

80
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,200
There's a print from the cum with a free bit and knife, too.

81
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,260
Thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

82
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,440
But, yeah, so, yeah, I've been, like, that's why I've been late.

83
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,620
I had to do a lot of stuff, I had to do bank stuff, too.

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,300
I did bank stuff yesterday, but, um, I couldn't finish the things I had to do at the bank.

85
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,740
I had to go again tomorrow to ship out more things.

86
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,780
And also, um, I needed to go to the bank tomorrow again.

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,500
Because I didn't go to the bank today, I went to the bank yesterday.

88
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Because today I didn't have time to go to the bank.

89
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,500
Uh, because it takes a long, I won't say how long it takes me to walk to the areas I need to walk to.

90
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,420
But, like, I keep forgetting how long it takes me to walk to the places I have to go to.

91
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,540
Because I was like, I should be back in time.

92
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,000
I was not back in time.

93
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,620
Obviously, I was not back in time.

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
I always underestimate how long it takes me to get home.

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,860
Of course you can!

96
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,820
Yeah, happy birthday!

97
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,060
Anyway, so, um, yeah, that's why it took me so long to get back.

98
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:31,340
I also had to, uh, uh, I just had a lot of stuff to catch up on in general.

99
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,440
Um, and, like, another thing was that, okay, this is why I'm a mess.

100
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,200
So, like, I got into a, um, a 30-minute lecture from my manager.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,500
Because they were like, you need to check your incoming wire transfers for the stuff you do.

102
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,040
Because, like, we need to, like, actually check if you're getting paid.

103
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,040
And I was like, oh, you mean, like, they might not pay me?

104
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,760
And they were like, uh, we don't know if, like, they actually paid you or not because you don't check.

105
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
And I was like, oh.

106
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,540
And then I looked at my, and I was, like, looking through my wire transfers coming in.

107
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,300
And then, like, from November, I was like, I don't know what's what.

108
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,940
And my manager was like, this is exactly why you have to be checking.

109
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,460
And I was like, oh.

110
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,920
Oh, my God.

111
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,600
And they were like, dude, you might be working for free.

112
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,400
And I was like, wait, you mean they might not send me the money?

113
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:50,150
So, so, so, like, we were, like, we were, because, like, for those who've never had done wire transfers before, or, like, received wire transfers, you don't see who sent, you don't see who sent you the money online.

114
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,410
You can't, it's just numbers.

115
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,330
And then, so, like, I, you know, I have a lot of them because I've done a lot of, like, deals.

116
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,270
I've done a lot of sponsors.

117
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,230
I've done a lot of brand deals.

118
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,990
I've done a lot of, like, a lot of, like, merch and stuff like that.

119
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,890
So, like, there was a lot.

120
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,550
But then, we don't know what correlates with what because I never kept up with it.

121
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,590
So, like, we were trying to figure it out by just the money being sent in.

122
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,730
And so, like, but, like, obviously, that's really difficult because we don't know.

123
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:34,230
So, then, tomorrow, I have to go to a bank and, like, be like, can I have, like, the names of everybody that sent me wire transfers since November?

124
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,190
So, we can tell.

125
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:43,370
We can, like, contact the people who we've done, like, stuff with and then be like, hey, I haven't been paid yet, you know?

126
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:49,830
Like, I'm gonna be like, hey, um, so, you remember, like, the sponsor I did in November?

127
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,570
Um, yeah, so, like, I just checked and I might not, I don't think I've been paid yet.

128
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,250
So, I need to confirm to see if I have been or not.

129
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:07,310
Yeah, I'm gonna start checking my accounts regularly, like, for it.

130
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:14,790
Um, and so, like, just to be sure that, just to be sure I'm getting paid for things I'm doing.

131
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,270
There's a lot of, the thing is, there's a lot of transactions.

132
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,170
I have been receiving a lot of wire transfers in.

133
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,670
So, I don't know which is for what.

134
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,850
Like, uh, Juan George, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

135
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,670
The first jokey may also be free.

136
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,990
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

137
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,890
Uh, Nexy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

138
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,510
Aphelion, thank you for the five gifted shoes, thank you, thank you.

139
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,590
Yeah, so, I'm learning.

140
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,470
I'm, guys, I'm learning, guys.

141
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,690
I'm fucking learning right now.

142
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,590
Every day is a new experience.

143
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,770
Also, I was gonna tell this story.

144
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,130
I told members I was gonna tell this story in a public stream.

145
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,350
Because, like, I didn't, I was like, oh, this story, I can't, guys, I can't tell this on a member stream.

146
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,770
Because it's a, it's a, it's a universal story.

147
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,950
Alright, give me a sec, guys.

148
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:17,570
I also just, um, boiled some water, so let me get some water real quick before I start the story, because I'm dehydrated.

149
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,510
I'll be right back.

150
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,610
Also, guys, I bought vitamins.

151
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,430
I actually, guys, guys.

152
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,450
I bought vitamins, guys.

153
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,670
Alright, listen to this.

154
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,590
I got Omega-3.

155
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,850
Because it says, it helps reduce cholesterol and promote heart health.

156
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,630
So I got, I'm taking them now.

157
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,250
I'm an adult, I got Omega-3.

158
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,250
It's a pill.

159
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,100
Okay, sorry, the water's too hot for me to drink too much of it, so.

160
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,340
It's a giant-ass fucking pill.

161
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,240
Take one of four soft gels daily.

162
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,480
Store it between, I hope this is 15 to 25 degrees.

163
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Pills here.

164
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,600
A Zelda, thank you for 50 gifted ships.

165
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,900
I also got D3.

167
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,620
You hear that?

168
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,160
Which supports a healthy immune system and bone health.

169
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,040
And I'm pretty sure, like, that's for the sunlight, right?

170
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,460
Because I do not get enough sunlight for sure.

171
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,610
So I got D3.

172
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,990
And then, I got chewables for vitamin C.

173
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,770
Which supports a healthy immune system.

174
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,570
So, look at that, guys.

175
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:06,090
I'm actually looking- Look, every day, I level- I gain, like, 1 XP.

176
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,430
You guys, you adults out there, you might be, like, level 50 right now.

177
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,970
And I might be, like, level 10.

178
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,370
But every day, I'm getting there, guys.

179
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,030
Every-

180
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,910
Every day, I'm getting there.

181
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,430
I'm getting better and better.

182
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,510
Every- Every day.

183
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,430
Tabby, thank you for the very first super chat.

184
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,330
Thank you, thank you.

185
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,730
Chat, what do I eat for dinner?

186
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,910
Carbonara or soup?

187
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,930
Carbonara, for sure.

188
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,450
Thank you for the super chat.

189
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,290
Thank you, thank you.

190
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,850
Your very first super chat, too.

191
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,770
Void Time, thank you for the super chat.

192
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,590
Thank you, thank you.

193
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,350
Doesn't matter.

194
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,290
That's just Doki.

195
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,650
Just- Oh, wait.

196
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,450
Doesn't matter.

197
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,470
Where's the Flintstone tablets?

198
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,770
Thank you for the super chat.

199
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,770
Thank you, thank you.

200
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,910
Wait, do I need to take iron supplements?

201
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,230
Oh, my gosh.

202
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:01,870
I don't know.

203
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,050
I literally just- I looked at- I was at the London Drugs.

204
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,210
I looked at the table of, like, the rows of vitamins.

205
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,510
And I was just, like- I remember- I remember Omega-3.

206
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,430
Because my mom used to, like, be like- Eat more fish- More fish so you get more Omega-3.

207
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,410
And shit like that.

208
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,770
So, like, I was like- I don't eat enough fish.

209
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,310
Maybe I should- Oh, if you bleed?

210
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,270
Oh, I don't bleed.

211
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,170
So, like, I should be fine, right?

212
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,990
I don't go outside enough to, like- Be in danger of bleeding.

213
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,050
Okay, so I just don't- So, I don't need to take iron then.

214
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,030
So, that's just for the lack of blood.

215
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,550
Uh...

216
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,290
Uh...

217
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,850
Let's see.

218
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,090
Out of context!

219
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,910
Thank you for the super chat.

220
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,610
Thank you, thank you.

221
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,070
Just a- It's a Flintstone gummies.

222
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,990
Thank you for the super chat.

223
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,970
Thank you, thank you.

224
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,110
Um...

225
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,170
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

226
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,770
Thank you, thank you.

227
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,310
Did you see that?

228
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,070
The last Sniper Elite game has an invasion mode that resembles those games?

229
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,590
No, I haven't.

230
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,390
I think the only Sniper Elite game I played was the one where I shot Hitler in the balls.

231
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,350
Which is, like, all of them.

232
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:09,810
Ha!

233
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,410
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,910
Which is basically all- All of them are like that.

235
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,910
Now that I think about it.

236
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,270
Sorry, sorry.

237
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,270
Correction.

238
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,710
In the one singular ball.

239
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,830
That got me so- Okay, anyway.

240
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,570
Story time!

241
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,570
So, like, um...

242
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,640
I was getting, um...

243
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,270
I was getting, like, bullied by one of my friends.

244
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,050
Friends?

245
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,010
Like, friend.

246
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,170
My singular friends.

247
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,090
That I have.

248
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,970
Um, because they were like, How much do you go outside?

249
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,650
Like, what's your step count?

250
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,430
Um, and then- Like, what's your step count?

251
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,370
And then I was like, I don't know, I don't have an Apple Watch.

252
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,150
And so they were like, Yeah, but, like, you take your dog out for walkies, right?

253
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,490
Like, so, like, your phone does that.

254
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,890
Your phone also, like, counts your- Uh, counts your steps.

255
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,890
And so, I was like, You know, sometimes I don't bring my phone out.

256
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,450
When I do walkies.

257
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,470
Cause, like, sometimes, um...

258
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,970
The reason why I don't bring my phone out sometimes when I do the walks.

259
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,890
Is that, uh...

260
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,790
Uh...

261
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,610
Uh...

262
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,570
Sometimes it's gonna be a really quick walk.

263
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,870
Cause, uh...

264
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,630
Dad just- Sometimes just wants to pee and poop and go home.

265
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,650
Like, that's literally it.

266
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,970
And so...

267
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,310
So, sometimes I just don't bring it.

268
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,070
Because there's no point.

269
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,730
I was just like, I just go downstairs.

270
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,290
I just go downstairs.

271
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,430
Take him out.

272
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,970
And then just let him poop and pee.

273
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,890
And then...

274
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,930
And then go home.

275
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,350
Like...

276
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,430
That's really it.

277
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,430
Um...

278
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,930
And then...

279
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,210
So, my friend was like, That's fucking crazy.

280
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,770
That you don't bring out your phone all the time.

281
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,870
Even when you're outside.

282
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,090
Um...

283
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,450
Because, like, What if there's an emergency?

284
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,130
Like, what if, like, you know, something happens to you?

285
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,550
And then I was like, Uh...

286
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,710
Doki can protect me.

287
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,410
Doki Amber Doge can protect me.

288
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,270
And then my friend was like, Are you fucking crazy?

289
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,510
What is he gonna do?

290
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,650
They're like, What the fuck is he gonna do?

291
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,820
He's...

292
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,380
He's so...

293
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,300
He's tiny.

294
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,220
And I was like, Well, I...

295
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,020
Well...

296
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,580
I was like, Well, if I'm getting...

297
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,400
They're like, What if they robbed you?

298
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,520
And then so I was like, Well, If they're gonna rob me, They're gonna take my phone.

299
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,740
So, I was like, What was the point of me bringing my phone?

300
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,060
And they're just gonna rob me and take it.

301
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,760
And so, So, So, like, That was...

302
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,840
So, I was just like, Yeah, like, What's the point?

303
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,700
And then, And then my friend was like, Okay, but what if there's an emergency?

304
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,640
And there was an accident?

305
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,900
And like, You are, like, The only person there, As a bystander, Watch...

306
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,940
That saw this accident that happened.

307
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,300
And you need to call the...

308
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,900
The...

309
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,400
Call, like, 911.

310
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,000
And then I was like, Well, I guess...

311
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,220
Sucks to be them that I was the only person there.

312
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,300
Like, I'm just like, I guess I'll just walk around and find someone to...

313
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,980
I'll just...

314
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
I'll just...

315
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,660
I was like, I guess I'll, like, Use their phone.

316
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,380
I don't know.

317
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,840
They might have a phone.

318
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,000
Guess I'll just die.

319
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,120
And then...

320
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,360
And I was just like, Well, maybe I'll...

321
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Maybe they'll have the phone.

322
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,720
Or like, what if they don't have the phone?

323
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:50,320
Then I was just like, Well, Well, if they don't have the phone, Maybe I'll walk around and find someone that will.

324
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,660
Like, it doesn't have to be my phone.

325
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,740
And...

326
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,640
And...

327
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Like, I don't know.

328
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,420
Someone else can make the call.

329
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,940
Why is it up to me?

330
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,940
Just bring your phone.

331
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,820
No!

332
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:03,920
No!

333
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,120
I've been doing this for so long and nothing bad has happened yet.

334
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,960
Just bring the damn phone.

335
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,980
This is genuinely...

336
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,840
I just don't do it all the time.

337
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,740
Sometimes I bring my phone.

338
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,320
Sometimes I don't.

339
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,860
Like, I feel like it's not the end of the world.

340
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,540
It's not.

341
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,740
Like, Sometimes it's just walkies.

342
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,440
It's...

343
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,720
It's just walkies.

344
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,680
I literally...

345
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,560
It's so close.

346
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,660
The fucking area for him to pee and poop is so close.

347
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,580
And there's people around me.

348
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,740
Like, what's gonna happen to...

349
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,020
Oh man, I'm gonna say that and then something's gonna happen to me today.

350
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,860
Dad has too much aura.

351
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
He's the alpha.

352
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,980
Dad, thank you for the super chat.

353
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,560
Thank you, thank you.

354
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,740
The walkie could be your last.

355
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,740
Not the jinx.

356
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,200
If I'm gonna get kidnapped, what the fuck is a phone gonna do for me?

357
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,060
What is it gonna do?

358
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,040
They're gonna take my phone anyway.

359
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,260
Don't say...

360
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,040
Now something will definitely happen.

361
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,960
Wait, okay.

362
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,580
Knock on...

363
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,100
Is this wood?

364
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,560
I don't know.

365
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,180
Yeah, this is wood.

366
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,140
Knock on wood.

367
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,120
I have it turned off.

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,280
Oh, I should turn it on.

369
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,460
Yeah, but what if they take my phone and break it?

370
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:47,620
I feel like if I'm getting kidnapped, the first thing they'll do is be like, Oh my god, she might have her phone on her and have the track on location thing.

371
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,840
So like, they'll just take my phone and destroy it.

372
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,800
I mean, that's kidnapping 101.

373
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,080
You know what?

374
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,280
If I was a kidnapper, the first thing I'd do is destroy their phone.

375
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,240
Because...

376
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,660
Destroy their phone and then throw it away.

377
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,560
Like, if I was a kid...

378
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,340
Not all kidnappers are smart.

379
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,800
I feel like if you're gonna kidnap somebody, you must have planned it out.

380
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,420
They would just pick something.

381
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,240
They would just be like, today I feel like kidnapping something right now.

382
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Their impulsive thoughts came out and was like, you know what?

383
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,660
I'm gonna do it today.

384
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,540
She has thought about this.

385
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,520
No, I literally thought, I literally came up with that within one minute of talking about it.

386
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,860
You overestimate the intelligence of criminals.

387
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

388
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:56,620
I feel like, I feel like a kidnapper would not just randomly decide to kidnap somebody out of the blue with zero planning.

389
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,540
Especially in my neighborhood.

390
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,300
Thank you for the super chat.

391
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,240
Thank you, thank you.

392
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,820
Doki knows a little too much about kidnapping.

393
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,080
We're worrying for the wrong person.

394
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,980
She is the danger.

395
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,940
Thank you for the super chat.

396
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,940
Thank you, thank you.

397
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,360
Also, also, I'm gonna tell you guys about what I was like really sad about.

398
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,300
Because, okay, so, I told this in the member stream.

399
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:36,040
I told this in the member stream, but like, at London Drugs, they have this thing called a confessional, a desktop confessional.

400
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,180
They have like a bunch of stuff, they have like desktop whatever.

401
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,980
So it's like these miniature things on your, on your table.

402
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,060
And cause I was like, what the fuck are these tiny boxes?

403
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,060
So like, so, I thought it was really fun, cause, and they had one that was called desktop confessional.

404
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,160
Now I'm so curious, I was like, the fuck is that?

405
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,160
And, so, I'm gonna read the backside.

406
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
So, in the front it says, you are forgiven.

407
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,480
And I was like, oh my god, what the fuck?

408
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,400
Like, is this like a miniature confessional?

409
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,180
Like, at your desk?

410
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,740
So, this is what it says in the back.

411
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
Tell me your sins.

412
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,700
Gain absolution from the comfort of your home with desktop confessional.

413
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:37,620
This mini confessional booth features a light-up screen, pressure-activated kneeler, and a holy voice that prompts you to share your sins before offering a comforting, you are forgiven.

414
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:48,420
So, I was like, oh my god, I can have a mini confessional to forgive me for every sin I commit on stream.

415
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,520
So, I was like, oh my god, that's fucking hilarious.

416
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,580
So, I bought it.

417
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,460
And, like, I took it out during the meme stream.

418
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:06,780
Because I just wanted to hear this holy voice go, you are forgiven.

419
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,120
Like, that's all I wanted to hear.

420
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,480
And, like, and it's broken.

421
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,580
It doesn't work.

422
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,940
The thing lights up, but there's no holy voice that tells me I'm forgiven.

423
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,620
I was so sad.

424
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,560
And so, like, I don't know if this is broken or a lie to me.

425
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,180
I was like, please, forgive me.

426
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,020
Why would they not forgive my sins?

427
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,600
You are not.

428
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,100
Okay, so I showed pictures of it.

429
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,120
So, this is, oh shit, sorry, this is a big picture.

430
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,360
So, like, this is what it looks like.

431
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,920
So, there's a, it's like tiny as fuck and I thought it was really funny.

432
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,100
So, like, there's the confessional.

433
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:07,600
So, behind this blank, behind this is a little window that lights up when you press the...

434
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,300
It, like, lights up when you press, like, the little bench thing.

435
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,840
And, like, here's the window of this.

436
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,800
And this is, like, the window.

437
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,760
So, like, it lights up and I just want it to forgive me.

438
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,860
So, like, I was like, I'm going back tomorrow.

439
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm gonna buy another one.

440
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,260
I need to know...

441
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,400
I need to know if the voice works.

442
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,660
I just...

443
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,980
Everything else works.

444
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,800
It lights up, by the way.

445
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,820
It fucking lights up.

446
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,280
But, like, that's it.

447
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
No forgiveness.

448
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,900
You can't force forgiveness.

449
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,640
So, I'm going back tomorrow and trying to...

450
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm buying another desktop confessional.

451
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,040
Just to see if it actually tells me if I'm forgiven or not.

452
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,140
Because it literally says...

453
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:18,000
A holy voice that prompts you to share your sins before offering and comforting you are forgiven.

454
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,240
Like, I...

455
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,180
Why is it not comforting me?

456
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,080
Like...

457
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,660
No mercy for the sinner.

458
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,100
It doesn't...

459
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,420
I don't understand.

460
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,960
Why won't it comfort me?

461
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,940
I just want you to comfort me and tell me I'm forgiven.

462
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,360
You confess your sins.

463
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,640
You need to go to an actual church.

464
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,120
Rice, thank you for the super chat.

465
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,100
Thank you, thank you.

466
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,180
It's almost as if you got scammed by a scam product.

467
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,340
Rice, thank you for the super chat.

468
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,760
Thank you, thank you.

469
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,620
Mr. Stan, thank you for the super chat.

470
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,320
Thank you, thank you.

471
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,060
Even gods must pay for their sins, don't they?

472
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,340
Thank you for the super chat.

473
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,500
Thank you, thank you.

474
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,060
It doesn't forgive me and I don't know why.

475
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,540
Like, everything else works.

476
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,640
It lights up.

477
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,600
So, yeah, I'm going back.

478
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,580
I have to do more errands tomorrow anyway because I need to go to the bank.

479
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,880
There's a London Drugs nearby.

480
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,340
Not nearby.

481
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,980
It's still a walk away.

482
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,600
So, I need to go to another...

483
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,380
I need to go there and buy another confessional desk.

484
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Stop confessional.

485
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,920
Repent.

486
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,300
Why do I feel like repenting today?

487
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,980
Like, how can I do it in the comfort of my own home?

488
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,860
Like, this is what it's for.

489
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,300
I just want to...

490
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,080
I just want to repent in the comfort of my own home.

491
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,400
I think the reasoning was that you would hear that you are forgiving inside you.

492
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,300
Not from the toy.

493
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,820
But it says a holy voice that prompts you to share your sins.

494
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,540
Where is this holy voice?

495
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,480
Where is it?

496
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,940
It even has a picture that says you are forgiven.

497
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,980
Okay, I'm going to take a picture of this.

498
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,260
I'm going to...

499
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,720
I'm going to take a picture of this, guys.

500
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,820
I need you guys to see, like, what I see and why I feel like I should be forgiven.

501
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,160
I need you guys to know.

502
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,160
It says for ages 14 and up.

503
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,760
How come a 14...

504
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,740
Why can't a 13-year-old confess?

505
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,860
I don't understand.

506
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
Why is it age-restricted?

507
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,420
Wait, what?

508
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,620
Why?

509
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:04,160
Why is my fucking desktop confessional age-restricted to, like, 14 and up?

510
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,780
That I don't...

511
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,660
13-year-olds have to go in person.

512
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,620
I don't understand.

513
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,140
They're not...

514
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,340
So they have to go in person.

515
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,020
Alright, I'm going to show you guys.

516
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,080
I'm going to show you guys what I see.

517
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,320
And why I believe I should be able...

518
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,540
Why I believe it's built into this fucking thing.

519
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,240
Okay, give me a sec.

520
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,400
Alright, so this is literally what I saw.

521
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,200
And I was like, I'm going to buy this.

522
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,140
Like, literally, desktop confessional, you are forgiven!

523
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,500
It literally tells me that I am forgiven.

524
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,120
Why won't you forgive me?

525
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,940
And then, this is...

526
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,500
This is the back side.

527
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,820
This is the back side of it.

528
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,340
Tell me your sins.

529
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,780
Gain absolution from the comfort of your home with desktop confessional.

530
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,560
This mini confessional booth features ages 14 and up.

531
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,360
Did you tell it your sins?

532
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,980
You can download a sound byte saying you are forgiven for free.

533
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,480
Also, the review says some of them are broken out of the...

534
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,180
Are you fucking kidding me?

535
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,520
I can't believe it!

536
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,760
Being forgiven is RNG?

537
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,280
Thank you for the super chat, Paladins.

538
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,060
I can't believe being forgiven is based on gotcha.

539
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,980
That's so fucked up.

540
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,560
I lost.

541
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,760
Doki was not forgiven.

542
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
Never forgiven.

543
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,220
Anyway, I'm buying another one.

544
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm going to test my luck and buy another desktop confessional.

545
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,700
I'm going to test my gotcha roll.

546
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,180
And see if I can...

547
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,140
I still don't understand why they age restricted it.

548
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,000
Why 14?

549
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,440
Do 13-year-olds just don't understand?

550
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,260
Don't get scammed again.

551
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,920
Alright, for anyone that super chats...

552
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,860
How much was it?

553
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,200
That super chats?

554
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,940
$13?

555
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,960
I will buy another confessional in your name.

556
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,020
Thank you for the super chat.

557
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,920
Thank you.

558
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,720
Doki's sins are so heavy to be forgiven by the desktop version.

559
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,040
Please upgrade the version.

560
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,860
Thank you for the super chat.

561
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,360
Thank you.

562
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,060
Thank you.

563
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,640
Thank you for the super chat.

564
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:00,980
Thank you.

565
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,540
Thank you.

566
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,260
Who's confessing in that tiny confessional booth?

567
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,440
Remy, Stuart, LittleBae, and I don't know why, but I can see TomatoDoki trying to wedge herself into the booth.

568
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,220
Thank you for the super chat.

569
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,920
Thank you.

570
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,280
Thank you.

571
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,540
Thank you for the super chat.

572
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,060
Thank you.

573
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,700
Thank you.

574
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,480
You are forgiven.

575
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,640
Alright, go for it.

576
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,080
Medi and Cas, thank you for the super chat.

577
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,500
Thank you.

578
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,600
Alright, I'll buy another one.

579
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,400
Just for you, dragons.

580
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,780
I'll buy another one.

581
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,140
That's alright.

582
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,440
Thank you, guys.

583
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,640
Thank you for enabling my confessional gotcha.

584
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,700
Next scene, Nara, Neppers, and Frozen.

585
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,680
Thank you for the super chat.

586
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,240
Thank you.

587
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,980
Thank you for the super chat.

588
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,320
Thank you.

589
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,980
Why am I doing this?

590
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,460
LaughingMan, thank you for the super chat.

591
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:57,860
Thank you.

592
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,280
Better get to...

593
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,300
Oh my god.

594
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,380
That's a lot of desktop content.

595
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,880
Buy a whole desktop chair.

596
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,140
Bro, I just want them to tell me that I'm forgiven.

597
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,300
That's all I want.

598
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,540
They're gonna have like...

599
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,320
This website's gonna have a surge of sales from us.

600
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:28,740
Just cause we all wanna test out our gotcha luck at getting forgiven.

601
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,580
LaughingMan She can buy a tent pole now.

602
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,720
Buy the whole set.

603
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,880
I'm so sad.

604
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,800
LaughingMan Literally, that was the only reason why I bought this.

605
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,840
I wanted a holy voice to forgive me.

606
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,320
LaughingMan Thank you, everybody, for the super chat.

607
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:55,780
Thank you.

608
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,440
Thank you.

609
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,080
Game, thank you for the super chat.

610
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,020
Thank you, thank you.

611
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,780
I can't think of a better way to spend money.

612
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,080
Go get a better one, Turkey, please.

613
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,500
The rest doesn't count.

614
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,260
Thank you for the super chat.

615
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,500
Thank you, thank you.

616
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,900
LaughingMan There will soon be forgiveness.

617
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,640
Just not today.

618
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,460
LaughingMan Thank you.

619
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,180
Thank you for the...

620
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,040
Thank you for the super chat.

621
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,760
Thank you, thank you.

622
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,620
Alright, guys.

623
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,740
It's time to ask...

624
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,040
Anyway.

625
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,260
That is my life update for today.

626
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,040
I had to do a lot of outside.

627
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,040
I had to touch grass a lot.

628
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,960
So that is my life update.

629
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,840
Anyway, let us play.

630
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,140
Also, PlaceboBuddy and NickName, thank you for your very first super chat.

631
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,620
Thank you.

632
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Oh, gosh.

633
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,940
Guys, my confessional is so popular.

634
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,580
LaughingMan Look, everybody wants their own desktop confessional, guys.

635
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,960
But thank you for your very first super chat.

636
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,200
Thank you, thank you.

637
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,160
You can get at least one that works.

638
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,980
LaughingMan I mean, it's a good idea.

639
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,600
It's such a good idea.

640
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,860
The amount of sin I commit every stream.

641
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,080
I just thought it'd be every time I do something bad.

642
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,880
I can literally get forgiven by my own personal desktop confessional.

643
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,160
LaughingMan I can get forgiven live on stream.

644
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,880
LaughingMan It's a good idea.

645
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,900
LaughingMan Anyway, guys.

646
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,620
That's not what we're going to play.

647
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,560
That's not my neighbor.

648
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,960
So, only if it works.

649
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,760
This really is the most Catholic thing I have ever seen.

650
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,240
Minimaxing your sins.

651
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,000
LaughingMan Anyway, guys.

652
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,320
LaughingMan Today, we are playing That's Not My Neighbor.

653
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:12,400
So, apparently, this game has come out a long time ago.

654
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,320
LaughingMan But it was on Ichigo.

655
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,420
I believe that's what...

656
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,960
I believe...

657
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,600
That's what...

658
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,300
What was it?

659
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,120
In the...

660
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,540
When you put...

661
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,700
Sorry, my brain is still frazzled up by my not working desktop confessional.

662
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,180
I'm still thinking about my fucking desktop confessional.

663
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,920
And not being forgiven for my sins.

664
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,880
LaughingMan I'm still thinking about it.

665
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,700
How am I that bad of a...

666
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:54,240
LaughingMan How much sin have I fucking committed that a miniature confessional would not forgive me?

667
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,060
LaughingMan Too...

668
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,720
Too much.

669
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,420
LaughingMan Anyway.

670
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,240
Sin is way heavy on the...

671
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,140
God has abandoned me.

672
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,820
LaughingMan Psalm 51 for the win.

673
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:20,620
LaughingMan LaughingMan You need to actually go to church.

674
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,900
With the amount of sin you've committed.

675
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,900
I need to go to Vatican City.

676
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,160
Just to be fully forgiven.

677
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,380
LaughingMan Okay.

678
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,160
Anyway.

679
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,900
Um...

680
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,720
So, this game was first released in Ichigo.

681
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,140
And...

682
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,720
Uh...

683
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,300
And...

684
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,300
It was very popular.

685
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,100
I believe.

686
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,800
Amongst, like, the community.

687
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,880
And...

688
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,260
I've never actually played the game before.

689
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,200
I've never played the game when it was first, like, on, like, Ichigo.

690
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,420
Cause now it's on Steam.

691
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,580
And I think they added a lot of, uh, new content.

692
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,480
And...

693
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,560
Um...

694
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,380
And...

695
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,060
The only thing I know about it was that everybody was...

696
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,600
All the...

697
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,860
All the...

698
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,760
Well, I wouldn't say, like, all the girls.

699
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,300
Cause, like, you know, some men could be also interested.

700
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,140
But, like, everyone was obsessed with a character called the Milkman.

701
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,180
And then I looked up the Milkman.

702
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,400
Cause I was like, why?

703
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,320
Cause I saw it on, like, YouTube Shorts and stuff.

704
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,720
People were making, like, animations about the Milkman.

705
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,600
And, you know, he obviously...

706
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,860
Artist's interpretation of the Milkman was really hot.

707
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,660
I was like, oh shit.

708
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,500
Like...

709
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,080
Like, I was like, damn.

710
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,440
Is the Milkman, like...

711
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,020
That should look like that?

712
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,760
Cause there were a lot of fanart about the Milkman.

713
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,280
So, I was really...

714
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
I was like, oh shit.

715
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,800
Let me...

716
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,680
Okay, I'll show you guys.

717
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,320
I literally googled Milkman.

718
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,260
Um...

719
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,200
That's not my neighbor.

720
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,160
And this was actually the first drawing that, like...

721
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,880
That came up on Google.

722
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,580
Like, the third.

723
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,280
Sorry, the third drawing that came up on Google.

724
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,980
So, he looked like that.

725
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,100
I was like, holy fuck.

726
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,700
Like, does he actually look like that?

727
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,440
I was so...

728
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,600
I was like, oh my god.

729
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,960
No wonder people are...

730
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,660
So obsessed with the Milkman in this game.

731
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,100
And so, like...

732
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,180
I was curious then.

733
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,420
I was like, alright then.

734
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,060
Let me google the Milkman.

735
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,380
And see what he actually looks like.

736
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
So, I googled him.

737
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,520
And he looks like this.

738
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,200
And I was like...

739
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,420
I was like...

740
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,420
I was just like...

741
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,180
He's just a tired man.

742
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,740
That's literally some...

743
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,460
Bro, he's just tired from his job.

744
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,140
I was like, oh, okay.

745
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,690
And I was like...

746
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,420
So, I was like...

747
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,240
I was like, oh, okay.

748
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,560
So, maybe he has a big part in the game.

749
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,840
Like, in the game itself.

750
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,940
So, that's why people are super obsessed with the Milkman.

751
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,660
But he doesn't.

752
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,780
He's just like...

753
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,060
The only...

754
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,840
I guess like...

755
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,300
I looked at the...

756
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,080
Like, in the game, from what I've read.

757
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,820
Is that...

758
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,000
Is that he's the only normal dude in the game.

759
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,300
So, like, everybody just latched on to him.

760
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,880
Because he's technically the most attractive looking one in the game.

761
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Like, from what I've read.

762
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,060
That's why people are obsessed with him.

763
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,840
Because this guy is the most attractive one in the entire game.

764
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,380
And I'm like, but he's just some dude.

765
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,120
He's just some dude tired from his fucking Milkman job.

766
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,840
The winner by default.

767
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,320
Yeah, in a room full of freaks.

768
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,680
Also, another thing I know about...

769
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,580
Women love a man in a uniform, doki.

770
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,980
Ah, yes.

771
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,340
Tale as old...

772
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,640
Tale as old as time.

773
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,320
The Milkman that comes to your home in the 1940s.

774
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,460
Wow.

775
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,520
Oh my gosh.

776
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,720
I hope...

777
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,880
I hope the husband doesn't know about the Milkman.

778
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,400
It's just ingrained in everybody.

779
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,380
Doki is shushed.

780
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,020
Wow.

781
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,160
People just want to bring back the Milkman in the 1940s.

782
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,260
No wonder you want to repent.

783
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,520
Moncler, thank you for the superchat.

784
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,680
Thank you, thank you.

785
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,580
Tired or not, I'm Milkmanning it.

786
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,500
Thank you for the superchat.

787
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,500
Thank you, thank you.

788
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,240
Anyway, another thing I know about That's Not My Neighbor.

789
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,700
Is that it's basically like Papers, Please.

790
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,200
But like, for your apartment.

791
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,160
So that's basically the context I got from the game.

792
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,100
And it has a really, really good fan song.

793
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,420
And the song, it's been stuck in my head for a long time.

794
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,400
I actually wanted to make an animation meme based on it.

795
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,760
Because there's an animation meme based on it.

796
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,180
It's called Open The Door.

797
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,460
It has such a fucking catchy hook.

798
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,900
And I remember when the first song first came out.

799
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,280
When I first found out about the song.

800
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,160
I was so obsessed with it.

801
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,420
Because I saw a lot of animation memes with this song.

802
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,900
And it's just, I don't know.

803
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,360
I just love the hook.

804
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,880
The hook is so good.

805
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,140
Where they start bashing the window.

806
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,380
I'll link the song.

807
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,280
So this is the song, you guys want to listen to it.

808
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,240
But that's been stuck in my head all the time.

809
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,120
Maybe I'll make an animation meme about it in the future.

810
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,300
Because the Doki Bites have been put on hiatus for a while now.

811
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,140
Because I've been super busy with everything else.

812
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,100
I don't have time to approve stuff.

813
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,020
So whenever I bring back the Doki Bites.

814
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,820
I might put that in as one request I want to make.

815
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,540
Let's actually play the game.

816
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,380
I might not be forgiven today.

817
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,240
But I'm not going to stop committing sins.

818
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,580
But that's not going to stop me.

819
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,280
Alright, let's go.

820
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,200
That's not my neighbor.

821
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,580
I'm going to speak Spanish.

822
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,080
We know.

823
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,860
That's the spirit, Doki.

824
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,040
It hasn't stopped me before.

825
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,660
That's why you weren't forgiven.

826
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,180
Play, record, settings.

827
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,620
Alright, what are the settings here?

828
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,120
Sound.

829
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,920
Alright, let me make sure I can see what Sound Guy says.

830
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,880
Later.

831
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,860
Aspect ratio.

832
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,240
What's this?

833
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:45,740
Oh, develop.

834
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,780
Oh, that's what it is.

835
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,500
Text for important sounds.

836
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,180
Large dialog box.

837
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,660
Sensor elements.

838
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,260
Turn off flashing lights.

839
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,940
That's fine.

840
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,060
Dial phone with keyboard numbers.

841
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,800
Wait, do I have to actually dial the phone?

842
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,340
Nah, that's fine.

843
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,640
We'll see it.

844
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,940
We'll see how it goes.

845
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,420
That's a real quote from my OC.

846
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,440
Alright.

847
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,380
Play.

848
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,840
The DDD requests that you complete the following training to apply for the position of doorman.

849
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,940
Okay, yeah, sure.

850
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,720
I'll do a tutorial.

851
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,560
How bad can it be?

852
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,120
No name.

853
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,900
Thank you for the super chat.

854
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,700
Thank you.

855
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Milkman is a friend to all housewives.

856
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,260
He brings the good stuff.

857
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,720
Oh, and milk too, I guess.

858
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,360
Thank you for the super chat.

859
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,260
Thank you, thank you.

860
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,920
The following short film is a production of the DDD for educational purposes.

861
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:40,920
Okay.

862
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:41,700
Whoa.

863
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:42,620
Hello.

864
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,360
If you are watching this short film, it's because you are the new doorman of your building.

865
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,540
Oh wait, there was an Akasupa earlier.

866
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,160
I'm so sorry.

867
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,200
Zelda, thank you for the Akasupa.

868
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,300
Thank you, thank you.

869
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,760
Hi Doki, love your content, your podcast, and all my draw sessions.

870
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,360
It's my birthday soon, but I won't be able to see it live then.

871
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,680
If I get a happy birthday, I'll be really happy.

872
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,400
That would be useless against a woman thief for sure.

873
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,920
Thank you for the Akasupa.

874
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,440
Thank you, thank you.

875
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,100
Of course, Zelda.

876
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,260
Happy birthday to you.

877
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
Happy birthday to you.

878
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,300
Happy birthday, dear Zelda.

879
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,300
Happy birthday to you.

880
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,500
Yeah, happy birthday!

881
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,780
Okay, your job is to determine whether a person requesting entry is a doppelganger or not.

882
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,060
As we all know, doppelgangers have the ability to take on someone's appearances and impersonate them.

883
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,720
But some are not very good at it, and it may create imperfections.

884
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,260
You must pay close attention to the physical appearances of your neighbors.

885
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,360
You cannot overlook any detail because that could result in your death or the death of your neighbors.

886
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,480
I mean, one neighbor dead is fine, right?

887
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,920
It's a three strike thing.

888
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,660
As long as there's not three bodies, it should be fine.

889
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,940
Your job and everything, and anyway, who likes all their neighbors anyway?

890
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,380
Your job is very important, so make sure you do it well.

891
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,780
Lastly, we congratulate the doorman of the month, Henry.

892
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,860
Not because he did an excellent job, but because he was the only doorman in the area who was not killed by doppelgangers.

893
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Wait, why'd he leave?

894
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,320
Be like Henry.

895
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,620
But better.

896
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,780
You can see why the milkman was like, the most sought after guy in this whole game now, right?

897
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:28,740
Alright.

898
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,940
Welcome and congratulations on your new job.

899
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:35,740
Thank you.

900
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:43,700
As you saw in the short film, your job is to verify the entry of the tenants of this building.

901
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,500
Now explain how your office works.

902
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,040
First, you're two out of ten in a world full of one out of ten!

903
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,480
Holy fuck!

904
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,060
First, you need to know the information about each tenant.

905
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,760
Inside this folder, you have all the information you need.

906
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,680
Go ahead and open the folder and take a note.

907
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,560
Oh no, there's so much reading.

908
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,880
Alright, where's the milkman?

909
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,620
There he is!

910
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,300
Let's talk to him!

911
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,100
Let's go!

912
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,960
We know where he lives!

913
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,160
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

914
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,900
Now we know where Francis Mosses lives!

915
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,200
Or as we like to call it, the milkman.

916
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,540
It's him!

917
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,560
Alright, so these are all our neighbors.

918
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,200
I mean, nah, no, yeah, no.

919
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,360
Francis, the milkman, is actually the two other tenants.

920
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,940
Out of all of them.

921
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,500
And move the mouse to change it to close the paper.

922
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,060
Use the right click.

923
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,480
Okay.

924
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,320
The next... I kinda see it now!

925
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,840
Not so dead full.

926
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,920
Thank you for the super chat.

927
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,960
Thank you, thank you.

928
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,240
My dad always hated the milkman, but I liked him.

929
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
He looked a lot like me.

930
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,120
Thank you for the super chat.

931
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,520
Thank you, thank you.

932
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,140
The next thing you need to check is the list of tenants that are supposed to request entry for the day.

933
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,840
This is today's list.

934
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,840
Please take the list and take a look.

935
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,320
Okay, just press the middle mouse button on photos in the list to mark them.

936
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,300
Oh, so if they already came in.

937
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:31,560
Okay.

938
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,300
Applicants must provide an identification card issued by the DDD.

939
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:38,380
Okay.

940
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,540
This is a sample identification card.

941
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,280
You must verify name, number, expiration date, photograph, and logo.

942
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,180
Okay.

943
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,180
Name, expiration... so every... all the text.

944
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,160
Oh, so the DDD.

945
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,400
Okay, I got it.

946
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,660
It looks like that.

947
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,680
Arrow up.

948
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,080
Alright.

949
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,580
I got it.

950
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:06,340
In addition to identification, applicants must provide a sealed entry request issued by the DDD.

951
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,240
This is the sample entry request.

952
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,640
Go ahead and take it and take a look.

953
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,960
Authorized by the DDD for the training of new employees.

954
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,440
Doki got high standards.

955
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,780
MrBrokenBot, thank you for the super chat.

956
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,800
Thank you, thank you.

957
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,360
Okay, reason, apartment number, full access.

958
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,820
Okay.

959
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,320
During the review process, you may need to contact an apartment in the building.

960
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,320
For this, you can use the phone in front of you.

961
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,220
Pick up the phone and dial the number.

962
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,180
Coding, you wish to dial and move the mouse.

963
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,220
Okay.

964
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:44,680
There you go.

965
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,560
You can interrogate the alleged tenant at any time.

966
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,400
Go ahead, ask me a question.

967
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:53,580
Appearance.

968
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,680
Here, the alleged tenant will give you the answer to your question.

969
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,020
For each applicant, you must fill out a checklist.

970
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,840
It's important that you complete it correctly as the list evaluates your performances.

971
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,400
Oh, bring the music down?

972
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,540
Okay, please take a checklist and complete the information as you like, as this is a sample.

973
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,740
Okay, so yep, yep, yep.

974
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,300
Yep.

975
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,220
Once the checklist is archived, you can decide whether to allow the applicant entry or not.

976
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,720
Go ahead and press any button.

977
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,220
Okay.

978
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,580
If at any time you determine that the applicant is a double-ganger, you must press the emergency button.

979
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,980
There is a reason why it is under a security box.

980
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,620
Once you press the button, there is no turning back.

981
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:42,970
When you press the button, you must wait for the cleaning protocol to be executed.

982
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,950
Once completed, you may continue with your work.

983
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:46,710
Very well!

984
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:47,510
Congratulations!

985
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:48,290
Yay!

986
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,310
I did it!

987
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:50,510
The bare minimum!

988
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,430
I bet it pays minimum wage.

989
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:53,210
There's no way.

990
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,270
I feel like I don't even need a degree for this.

991
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,650
Successfully completed the job training program for the passionate position.

992
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,190
I mean, it's literally a doorman.

993
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,390
I bet I got paid minimum wage.

994
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:10,490
Alright.

995
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,350
Nice.

996
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,650
Oh, I can save it as a PNG, guys.

997
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,410
Save a PNG.

998
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,130
Oh my god!

999
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,290
I'm gonna...

1000
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,550
You know what?

1001
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,730
I'm gonna put it in my room.

1002
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,310
Actually, let me...

1003
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,090
Let me save this, actually.

1004
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:31,350
What if I just print it out and put it on my wall?

1005
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,990
Just have it framed.

1006
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,070
They're like, oh my god, Duke, is that your college degree?

1007
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:42,130
No, it's my job training certificate.

1008
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,930
But that's not my neighbor.

1009
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,470
Put it beside the desktop confessional.

1010
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:51,870
Alright.

1011
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,070
Let me adjust the...

1012
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,410
Let me adjust the music real quick.

1013
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:57,850
I'm gonna do it.

1014
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:58,890
You think I won't?

1015
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,790
I'm gonna put it in game and in my background.

1016
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,790
Alright, I'll turn the music down.

1017
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,490
Alright, let's go.

1018
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,930
Let's play the first level.

1019
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,990
Alright, the true experience of a work week as a building store man.

1020
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,450
How bad can it be?

1021
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,250
Hello.

1022
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,250
What's on today's list?

1023
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,330
You look pretty normal.

1024
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:30,770
Okay.

1025
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,310
What?

1026
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,570
Alright, the DDD protects us.

1027
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,290
Hundreds of doppelgangers are successfully eliminated every day.

1028
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,070
Tensions at the border.

1029
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:45,610
Allied countries are fearful of suspicious movements from enemy countries.

1030
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,010
How much longer will this artificial peace last?

1031
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,130
Clown movement.

1032
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,930
Strange individuals wearing clown masks are distributing pamphlets throughout the city.

1033
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,210
You're completely harmless.

1034
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,390
Oh, and then there's missing person.

1035
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:00,850
Titor!

1036
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,270
Oh no, not Titor.

1037
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:04,410
Alright.

1038
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,050
Oh, he was just a news guy.

1039
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,950
Oh, I thought... Okay.

1040
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,750
Good afternoon.

1041
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,590
Wait, is that her?

1042
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,410
Wait, why you look different?

1043
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,710
What happened to your hair, Miss Illinois?

1044
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,620
Wait, you're not on the list.

1045
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,540
Wait a minute.

1046
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,480
You're not on the list.

1047
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,520
Maya?

1048
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,800
The fuck are you?

1049
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,440
F-O-3-O-1?

1050
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,200
You're not even on this list.

1051
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,840
F-O-3-O-O-1.

1052
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:41,920
Maya Stone?

1053
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,340
Wait, you're not on the list.

1054
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,520
Who let you outside?

1055
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,060
Who the fuck let you outside?

1056
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,020
It's the weekend, lady.

1057
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,060
You only go to school and come home.

1058
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,890
Today's list, yeah.

1059
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,130
It's Saturday.

1060
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,070
What kind of work emergency would you have?

1061
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,250
That's sus.

1062
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,030
Okay, let's see.

1063
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,690
That's suspicious as hell.

1064
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:20,690
Okay, 7, 8, when's your birthday?

1065
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,070
Oh, you're right, I should call her.

1066
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,150
7, 8, 9.

1067
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:33,450
7, 8, 9.

1068
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,030
Guys, 7, 8, 9.

1069
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:40,350
Guys, do I have to write her phone number down?

1070
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:41,310
Okay.

1071
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:41,390
Okay.

1072
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:46,370
Wait, what's this expiration date?

1073
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,470
I don't know where I put it.

1074
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,050
What date is it today?

1075
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,870
I'm coming from my job as a teacher.

1076
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:55,750
1, 4, 2, 5.

1077
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,230
Wait, how do you- Oh shit, there you go.

1078
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,010
1, 4, 2, 5.

1079
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:02,890
I thought I had to dial the actual- 1, 4, 2, 5.

1080
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:08,730
Pick up the phone.

1081
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:13,210
Oh my god.

1082
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,910
This is Maya speaking.

1083
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,070
Roommate?

1084
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:21,170
Wait.

1085
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:22,830
Wait a minute.

1086
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:24,930
You're not Maya.

1087
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:27,030
You're a doppelganger!

1088
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,050
Get out!

1089
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:30,110
That's fucking right!

1090
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,510
Imposter!

1091
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,670
Imposter!

1092
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:35,970
Yay!

1093
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:37,690
See, look at that.

1094
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,830
Get her out of here.

1095
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,510
How dare she trick me.

1096
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:43,990
Lock her up.

1097
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:44,710
Okay, okay.

1098
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,830
You're on the list, Margaret.

1099
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,030
Maya, you're looking awfully happy today.

1100
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,490
I'm a resident of the building.

1101
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:56,230
My apartment is 03- Oh my god, there's so much information.

1102
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,230
Second floor.

1103
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,170
Okay.

1104
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,810
You are Margaret Bubbles.

1105
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,390
What's your identity card?

1106
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:12,210
1-0-3-2-6-8-0-1-4.

1107
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,570
Wait, what date is it today?

1108
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,630
1917- Wait, what?

1109
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,730
It's 1955.

1110
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,510
Wait, it's 1955?!

1111
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:27,530
Why is your- Oh shit, maybe the ID card expires late.

1112
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,990
I don't know.

1113
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:35,130
I mean, like, I guess it's correct.

1114
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:39,770
Wait, but like, why is- Can the stamp be like that?

1115
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,430
Can the stamp be curved?

1116
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:48,050
Holy shit, an ID expires in like, that long?

1117
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,250
20 years ID card?

1118
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,030
That's crazy.

1119
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,530
Wait, I should- You're right.

1120
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:57,590
Okay, what's the number again?

1121
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:58,750
6-4-3-1.

1122
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:03,570
6-4-3-1.

1123
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,210
Hello, is she home?

1124
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,630
Oh, she's not home.

1125
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,710
Oh, she lives by herself, that's sad.

1126
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:14,950
Margaret.

1127
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,670
Do we have friends, Margaret?

1128
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,450
Let me talk to you.

1129
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:20,830
Everything looks good!

1130
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:23,850
Um...

1131
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,590
Wait, is this how you look like?

1132
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,060
Um...

1133
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,780
Yeah, you are, but like, I just wanted to fuck with you.

1134
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,100
I mean, everything looks alright.

1135
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,460
I feel like you look- You're okay, you know what?

1136
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,820
You're one of the good ones.

1137
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,600
Margaret Bubbles.

1138
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,340
Margaret Bubbles.

1139
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:01,140
Yeah, I just don't know if this is- If it's okay if this is like, facing to like, that angle.

1140
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,400
Like, nothing strange so far.

1141
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,180
Alright.

1142
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,220
Yeah, she's not a doppelganger.

1143
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,340
We do not serve doppelganger kind here in this apartment.

1144
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1145
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:17,860
Yay!

1146
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,880
Welcome home, Margaret!

1147
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,760
Go back to your sad life living alone, I guess.

1148
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,740
I say as I also live alone.

1149
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,760
Guys, I'm not sad!

1150
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,860
I'm not sad!

1151
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,220
Oh, is it 32?

1152
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,500
I see.

1153
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,520
Oh, it's 42.

1154
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,540
It's been a long time since I've watched Hitchhiker's Guide of the Galaxy.

1155
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:52,540
42.

1156
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,580
I was like, it's something 2.

1157
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,740
I was almost there.

1158
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,420
I'm not sad!

1159
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,860
I have a dog.

1160
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,520
What?

1161
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,740
It's not 42?

1162
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,160
No!

1163
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,080
Science has been wrong?

1164
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:20,180
Is this shirt supposed to be striped?

1165
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,940
I mean, you look the same.

1166
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,100
What's your ID card, woman?

1167
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,980
There you go, thank you.

1168
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,880
Sorry, sorry, I got a little too aggressive there.

1169
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,520
I was sad that I got the answer wrong.

1170
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,520
Oh, he asked for the year.

1171
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,060
Why the fuck is it 1942?

1172
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,260
I mean, it could be the year 42.

1173
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,180
Illinois...

1174
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,100
Sorry, I got a little antsy there.

1175
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,660
I got the answer wrong and it made me sad.

1176
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,840
Oh wait, that's 3.

1177
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,680
Wait, is it supposed to be 3 or 4?

1178
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,960
Oh, it's supposed to be 3.

1179
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,880
Okay, you live on...

1180
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,640
Floor 1, 4th floor.

1181
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:08,580
Illinois...

1182
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,020
8...

1183
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,780
845323014 Wait, why is there 2 of you?

1184
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,900
Wait, are you twins?

1185
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,260
I was like, oh this is the right mall.

1186
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,780
Oh wait, what's your mall?

1187
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,900
Okay, that's your mall.

1188
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,800
Oh my god, it's twins.

1189
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:31,320
Okay.

1190
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,760
What's your phone number?

1191
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,560
6996...

1192
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:36,900
6...

1193
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,380
9...

1194
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,240
9...

1195
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,080
6.

1196
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,120
Oh my god, they're twins.

1197
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,900
Someone would say quadruplets.

1198
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,800
This is... what do you need?

1199
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,180
Where's your roommate?

1200
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,040
No, there are no important documents in the... okay.

1201
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,700
She seems normal.

1202
01:02:59,040 --> 01:02:59,860
Nice.

1203
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,920
Why did they say quadruplets?

1204
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,150
Oh, he's...

1205
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:14,500
Like, it's unknown where is an innocent boy.

1206
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,080
Oh, silly chatter.

1207
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,260
Wait, but like...

1208
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,140
I guess it doesn't look at colors of the shirt.

1209
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,840
I guess everything looks good.

1210
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:35,980
Yeah, they're all on there.

1211
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,700
Alright, get in there.

1212
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:39,940
Get in there.

1213
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,120
Be with your sister.

1214
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,500
You seem pretty, Norma.

1215
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,080
Yay, I did it!

1216
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:47,840
Hello.

1217
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,020
Where's your ID card?

1218
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,660
Oh wait, sorry.

1219
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,340
Wrong one.

1220
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,800
Identification card, please.

1221
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:54,700
Alright.

1222
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,580
Is that your ID?

1223
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:56,840
Okay.

1224
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,100
Yeah, there's nothing wrong.

1225
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,180
Oh my god, Afton!

1226
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,320
Oh my god, William Afton?

1227
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,240
From the byte?

1228
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:08,580
Of 95?

1229
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,160
Of 42?

1230
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,480
Sorry, the byte of 42?

1231
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,680
Alright, DDD, the triple D's.

1232
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,080
Oh my god.

1233
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,360
The byte of 42.

1234
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,300
He was like, Dr. W.

1235
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:26,560
Afton.

1236
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,620
Oh shit, fuck.

1237
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,320
There's too many documents.

1238
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,440
Where is this?

1239
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,440
Oh wait, there's your ID card.

1240
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,400
250-489-656.

1241
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,540
Okay, that seems correct.

1242
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,400
You look like him.

1243
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,500
What's your phone number?

1244
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,360
1425.

1245
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:54,250
Hello?

1246
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:55,710
Is your wife home?

1247
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:57,590
This is Maya, what do you need?

1248
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:58,310
Where's your roommate?

1249
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:02,910
Okay, so William Afton is actually outside.

1250
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,610
Alright, everything looks good.

1251
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:08,290
301.

1252
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,990
Yeah, 301.

1253
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,470
Wait, they're not even married.

1254
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:16,030
They're just roommates.

1255
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:17,090
Guys, look.

1256
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:21,490
She didn't take...unless she wants to be a strong, independent woman in 1955.

1257
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:23,950
She didn't take his last name.

1258
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,090
Oh my god.

1259
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,070
And they're just roommates.

1260
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,370
Oh, it could be their fiancé, you're right.

1261
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,890
They were roommates.

1262
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,630
Oh yeah, they're just roommates.

1263
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:41,730
Everything looks good.

1264
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,890
Nothing suspicious out there until he starts murdering children.

1265
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:45,850
Alright.

1266
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:48,210
Yep, yep, yep.

1267
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:53,570
Yep.

1268
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:55,710
Wait, there's lore in this update?

1269
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,830
You're safe to go, sir.

1270
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,690
You're right in.

1271
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,460
Well done.

1272
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,320
I think I'm doing a great- Oh!

1273
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:28,570
He wanted?

1274
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:32,290
The fuck does that mean?

1275
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:37,570
Okay.

1276
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,410
Let me double check to be sure.

1277
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:44,470
Let me-

1278
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,260
Just to be sure.

1279
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,480
You know...

1280
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,580
She might have had a really rough day at the-

1281
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,580
She might have had a really rough day- You don't know her life, guys.

1282
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,340
She might have had a really rough day at the seamstress store.

1283
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,160
You don't know her life.

1284
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:10,720
Okay.

1285
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,500
F to Margaret Bubbles.

1286
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,960
Look, this- Look, the Doppelganger worked really hard on these fake IDs.

1287
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:19,520
Okay?

1288
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,520
Fake IDs are very expensive, guys.

1289
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,000
Okay?

1290
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,120
Like, I might as well entertain it for a little bit.

1291
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,760
Just to make her feel better.

1292
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:32,160
Just- Just saying.

1293
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,620
Someone's like, we already let her in, ducky.

1294
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:45,000
Not hard enough on plastic surgery.

1295
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,560
Look, she ran out of money.

1296
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,280
Just to be safe.

1297
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,900
Let's call her.

1298
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,900
She might have gotten into a really fucked up accident.

1299
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,440
And Margaret could use a roommate.

1300
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,360
Right now, I'm the only one in the apart- You live alone.

1301
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,860
You're always the only one in the apartment.

1302
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,680
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1303
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,080
I called the apartment.

1304
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,580
And like, Margaret is already living there.

1305
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,580
So I have to- I have to press the button.

1306
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,120
She just had an allergic reaction.

1307
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:25,540
Alright.

1308
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,500
You may continue with your work.

1309
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,200
Don't get so cruel.

1310
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,890
Wait, you're back?

1311
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,430
Wait, did you go outside again?

1312
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,130
Did you?

1313
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:47,010
Okay, let me just- Make sure you didn't go outside while I was busy with this.

1314
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:49,830
1425.

1315
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:50,750
Wait a minute.

1316
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:51,870
You were just here.

1317
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,710
Did you forget something at the physics office?

1318
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,280
Was there a child you forgot to kill?

1319
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:06,270
Oh shit.

1320
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:07,790
All the people?

1321
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,130
You mean your roommate?

1322
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:10,330
Slash husband?

1323
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:11,990
Alright, I'm sorry.

1324
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:16,190
I'm sorry, but he's already- I mean, you- Great job, though.

1325
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:17,990
Very good job.

1326
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,670
It's- It's a lot.

1327
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:23,170
It's definitely- You definitely worked really hard on this identity.

1328
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:30,390
Guys, I feel like- There must be like- A guy that just makes fake IDs for all these doppelgangers.

1329
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,210
And he must be really fucking rich.

1330
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:32,950
Or she.

1331
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,890
I wish I was that person.

1332
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:35,850
Alright.

1333
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:36,590
Goodbye.

1334
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:39,830
Just a bit late.

1335
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:41,470
Probably.

1336
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:45,310
Seems like a very- But what if he's the real one?

1337
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:48,370
There can only be one William Afton!

1338
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:52,930
Alright.

1339
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,150
Did I do it?

1340
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,830
Did I do my job correctly?

1341
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:00,650
Yay!

1342
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:02,930
I got you too!

1343
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:03,950
I got three!

1344
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:04,990
Sorry, I can't count.

1345
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,770
I didn't eliminate any neighbors!

1346
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:10,090
Let's go!

1347
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:12,730
See?

1348
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,290
None of my neighbors died!

1349
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:15,710
Look at that!

1350
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:17,050
It's that easy.

1351
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,020
Alright.

1352
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,100
What's the news today?

1353
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,740
Hello, sir.

1354
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,520
What's the news today?

1355
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,060
Meet Henry, the doormat of the month.

1356
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,140
Courtesy- What did he and Henry do?

1357
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,460
I captured three!

1358
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,940
How many did Henry capture?

1359
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,220
Good news.

1360
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:41,240
There's no missing persons report.

1361
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,260
You guys don't think I'm crazy, right?

1362
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,460
Good afternoon.

1363
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,620
Are you on the list?

1364
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:13,260
Raftalin.

1365
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,460
Alright.

1366
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,200
Raftalin.

1367
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:17,980
Kapuchin.

1368
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,620
You're on the list.

1369
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,240
Everything seems alright.

1370
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,540
The triple D's.

1371
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,700
I am a rising- Wait.

1372
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,620
Yeah, everything looks alright.

1373
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,620
For your entire complexion.

1374
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,560
Okay, not this one.

1375
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,020
Alright, where's my data?

1376
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,920
Uh, Raftalin.

1377
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,160
Uh, where do you live?

1378
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,000
F-O-3-O-4?

1379
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,520
The fourth floor?

1380
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:46,940
Raftalin.

1381
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,220
Kapuchin.

1382
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,060
I mean, that's spelled correctly.

1383
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,320
You're a housewife.

1384
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,240
Why did you go outside?

1385
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:03,470
It doesn't say why.

1386
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,190
It just says you live here.

1387
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:08,030
Huh.

1388
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,710
Why won't you tell me why you went outside, ma'am?

1389
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:13,990
Huh?

1390
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,830
4-2-8-5.

1391
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:18,010
Let's see what your husband thinks about this.

1392
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:19,030
Going outside.

1393
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,690
A housewife says house.

1394
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,050
Wait, why did it hang up?

1395
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:29,330
Did I call the wrong number?

1396
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:30,950
4-2-5-8.

1397
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:31,370
I did.

1398
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:35,010
4-2-5-8.

1399
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,560
Hello, this is Al speaking.

1400
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,560
Where's your roommate?

1401
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,180
Okay, so she is...

1402
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,500
Okay, so she is out.

1403
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:51,860
Okay.

1404
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,620
She is out.

1405
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,520
I mean, everything looks good.

1406
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,260
People need a touch crash.

1407
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:57,940
No, they don't.

1408
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,540
I mean...

1409
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,400
This is too perfect.

1410
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,700
Okay, I'll question her.

1411
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,180
Why did you go outside?

1412
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,300
There's nothing wrong.

1413
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:17,900
She's right.

1414
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:18,880
She's got me there.

1415
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,980
You know she's the wife of a lawyer.

1416
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,500
She's got me there.

1417
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:26,340
Alright.

1418
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,340
I guess I'll let you win.

1419
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,060
Everything looks good.

1420
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,780
You're also on today's list.

1421
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,900
Oh my god, the milkman's coming home.

1422
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:37,980
Ooh.

1423
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,320
We're gonna see the milkman tonight.

1424
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:43,900
Alright.

1425
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,140
Alright.

1426
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,960
Go in there and have fun with your husband.

1427
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:48,820
Hello.

1428
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:54,420
Yeah.

1429
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,640
I mean, your face looks like your face.

1430
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,780
Wait, where's your entry request?

1431
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:00,920
Thank you.

1432
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,220
Alright, Isaac.

1433
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,160
Wait, the stamp's wrong.

1434
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:10,910
Or, oh wait, no, it's smudge.

1435
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,190
That counts, right?

1436
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,450
It smudged a bit.

1437
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,790
Okay, where do you live?

1438
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,610
Let me dox you real quick.

1439
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,390
F0202.

1440
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,370
Okay, lives alone.

1441
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:25,210
Isaac.

1442
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,070
Guys.

1443
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,350
Alright.

1444
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:29,810
F0202.

1445
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:36,630
Guys, just cause he looks like a reporter doesn't mean he's evil.

1446
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:40,530
Guys.

1447
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:41,590
Guys.

1448
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:46,090
Everything is fake news, guys.

1449
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,540
Isaac, guys.

1450
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,500
I mean, nothing seems wrong.

1451
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,540
7332.

1452
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,320
7332.

1453
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:06,520
Alright.

1454
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,150
No one picks up.

1455
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:13,050
No one picks up.

1456
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:13,390
Alright.

1457
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,890
I mean, everything looks good, sir.

1458
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,650
I have nothing else to report about you.

1459
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:23,910
Can I also have an autograph for my nephew?

1460
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,350
He loves watching the Channel 5 News.

1461
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:32,770
Also, if you know the weather girl, I'd like to have her autograph too.

1462
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:38,010
Alright, everything looks good, Mr. Isaac.

1463
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:39,850
Guys.

1464
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:44,020
I don't think anything suspicious is going around, so...

1465
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,990
Yeah, come right in.

1466
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,010
Alright.

1467
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:55,700
Go back to your sad little apartment.

1468
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:59,590
Oh my god, it's the Milkman!

1469
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:05,870
The star of the show, right here.

1470
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:06,990
It's him.

1471
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:08,210
Alright.

1472
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,090
Woah, Milkman.

1473
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,590
Francis Moses.

1474
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,950
I am coming home from my job as the Milkman.

1475
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:17,790
Everything looks great, Mr. Francis.

1476
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:20,490
F0302.

1477
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,590
Yep, that's exactly the myth himself.

1478
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,830
Oh my god, the man, the myth, the legend.

1479
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:28,450
Okay, F0302.

1480
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:30,210
And he lives alone?

1481
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:32,430
Ladies, he's single.

1482
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:37,590
For all you housewives out there.

1483
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:40,290
Alright.

1484
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:41,810
For...

1485
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:43,970
Guys, and I have his phone number.

1486
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,250
Housewives, housewives.

1487
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:47,350
I...

1488
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:51,690
Oh, okay.

1489
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,130
Wait, alright.

1490
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,370
Wait, everything looks good, Mr. Francis.

1491
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,730
Alright, let me check his ID, just to be sure.

1492
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:04,870
235569418.

1493
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,050
Francis Moses.

1494
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:07,830
Alright.

1495
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:09,590
You're good to go, sir.

1496
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:12,370
Let me double check.

1497
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,970
Just in case.

1498
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,590
Yep, you look very depressed.

1499
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,470
That sounds about right.

1500
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:23,530
Maybe he's tired from all the housewives.

1501
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,410
You know?

1502
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,770
It's like that Mr. Fantastic meme.

1503
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:32,310
Maybe...

1504
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,550
Maybe he's just tired.

1505
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:39,010
What's wrong with the hat?

1506
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:44,370
Take off your hat.

1507
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,510
Ask him about the hat.

1508
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:49,750
Milkman, take off your hat.

1509
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:51,730
Entertain us, chat.

1510
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:56,430
Guys, he's a person.

1511
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:59,170
We can't just ask him to take off his hat, guys.

1512
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,850
We can't.

1513
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:04,710
He has an actual, reputable job.

1514
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:06,410
Rodrigo.

1515
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1516
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:09,390
Thank you, thank you.

1517
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:12,170
The child support must be crazy.

1518
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:13,370
Guys!

1519
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:17,870
We can't just randomly ask people to take off their hats.

1520
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:25,890
No, the hat stays on.

1521
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:28,610
Alright, you're good to go, Mr. Milkman.

1522
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:32,930
Yes, we can.

1523
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:34,970
It's literally our job.

1524
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:36,410
Alright.

1525
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:37,550
Go in.

1526
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,550
Mr. Hatman.

1527
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:40,870
Perfect.

1528
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:43,710
Wait, I don't like how you said that.

1529
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:44,650
Wait.

1530
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,370
Wait, did I fuck up?

1531
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:48,190
I don't like how you...

1532
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:50,330
Wait.

1533
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:54,890
Why did he say it like that?

1534
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,150
Wait a minute.

1535
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:58,190
Wait a minute.

1536
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:04,230
Why did the Hatman say it like that, guys?

1537
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:05,850
I don't know.

1538
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:08,550
Perfect.

1539
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:14,110
I think we all got distracted.

1540
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:18,510
But if he was a doppelganger, we all maybe got a little too distracted.

1541
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:24,050
Every night, all around the world, 100 people see this cloud in their dreams.

1542
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:27,870
If this cloud appears in your dream, do not forget it is a dream.

1543
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:28,410
Okay.

1544
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,670
Thanks, Cloudman.

1545
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,490
The Church of Cloud.

1546
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:34,410
Wait, you're the other sister.

1547
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:36,210
You're not.

1548
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:39,190
You're the other one.

1549
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:42,030
The one with the mole on the left.

1550
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,990
Yeah, her.

1551
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,450
Selene.

1552
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:48,410
Selene.

1553
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:53,250
The earrings.

1554
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:54,170
Yeah, they're square.

1555
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:58,110
Sir...

1556
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:58,490
Severed...

1557
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:58,970
Check.

1558
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,110
Approved.

1559
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,170
Yeah, the triple three.

1560
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,070
Triple D's look about right.

1561
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,430
Where does she live again?

1562
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:12,730
First, fourth floor.

1563
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:14,330
Severed...

1564
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,930
Wait, are they all just neighbors?

1565
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,270
Did the doppelgangers just give up?

1566
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:19,850
I'm just too good at my job.

1567
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,810
What can I say?

1568
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:23,730
7, 8, 5, 6, 1, 3...

1569
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:25,450
2, 6, 9.

1570
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,510
I'm just that good at my job.

1571
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:34,110
Alright.

1572
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:38,310
Nothing seems...

1573
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,690
Nothing seems wrong.

1574
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,210
6, 9, 9, 6, 6...

1575
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:43,290
9...

1576
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:44,770
9...

1577
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,590
9...

1578
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:47,650
6.

1579
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:49,610
Hello?

1580
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:49,930
Hello?

1581
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,730
Is your twin home?

1582
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:56,790
Illinois.

1583
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,070
Where's your roommate?

1584
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,190
Okay, so she is outside.

1585
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:01,350
Alright.

1586
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,510
Nice.

1587
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,110
Alright.

1588
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:09,510
Wait, let me double check.

1589
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,190
I mean, everything looks good.

1590
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,070
Her most to the left.

1591
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:17,290
She has the square earrings.

1592
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,910
Her little hair twirl right there.

1593
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:21,230
Alright, 1, 2, 3...

1594
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,530
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

1595
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:26,350
1, 2, 3, yeah.

1596
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,590
Alright.

1597
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,770
Get to your other twin.

1598
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:35,670
What about the lips?

1599
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,650
It could be natural, guys.

1600
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:39,710
Don't judge.

1601
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:46,090
It could all be natural.

1602
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:50,010
Are you a dog?

1603
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:52,110
Are you on the list?

1604
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:53,010
You're not on the list.

1605
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:57,410
Because I had to leave due to an emergency.

1606
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:58,630
You're a child!

1607
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,710
What emergency can you have?

1608
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:04,690
F204.

1609
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:09,870
Left eye green, right eye blue.

1610
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:13,210
Where's your...

1611
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:14,070
Where's your guardian?

1612
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:16,910
Give me your ID.

1613
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,390
Wow.

1614
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,570
Hey there, don't be rude to me today.

1615
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:25,390
I am the doorman.

1616
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:30,990
Because I get paid minimum wage, I am fucking high with power.

1617
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:33,490
This is the only time I can use my authority.

1618
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:37,150
Because my life fucking sucks because I work as a doorman.

1619
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:39,390
Alright.

1620
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,870
Let's see.

1621
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:43,630
Anastasia.

1622
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:47,370
Whose lost child is this?

1623
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:48,610
Okay.

1624
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:49,850
That seems correct.

1625
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:52,630
1-3-2-6-9-8-5-3-4.

1626
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,410
I shouldn't even let her in the apartment.

1627
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,930
She doesn't even have the right papers.

1628
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,010
I mean, everything looks correct.

1629
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:06,150
She just sleeps outside until she gets her...

1630
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:09,510
Until she files a proper request to go out.

1631
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,290
1-3-4-6.

1632
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,530
Hello.

1633
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:27,610
This is Nacha speaking.

1634
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,270
Where's your roommate?

1635
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:36,650
Do you also call your daughter, your children, your roommates?

1636
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,370
She doesn't even pay rent.

1637
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:42,670
I don't believe that her daughter even pays rent.

1638
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:47,190
Hit the button and make her regret it.

1639
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:50,430
No.

1640
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:52,470
She is not on today's list.

1641
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:55,170
Do I just not let her in?

1642
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,710
Don't assume.

1643
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,850
How does she pay rent?

1644
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:05,230
I mean, she could have a part-time job.

1645
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:09,630
That's pretty fucked if you let your sister pay...

1646
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:14,990
make your sister pay for rent while she's going to middle school.

1647
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:22,430
Um...

1648
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:25,170
Uh... I mean, everything looks correct.

1649
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:26,990
I don't see anything else.

1650
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:27,490
Alright.

1651
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:28,750
Wait.

1652
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,330
I actually didn't check your face.

1653
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:30,630
Sorry.

1654
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:33,110
I was not paying attention to your face.

1655
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:38,510
You were so rude to me that I wasn't caring about it.

1656
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:40,390
Okay, yeah.

1657
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,770
Everything looks good.

1658
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,010
Alright.

1659
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,570
I guess you can go through.

1660
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:51,350
I mean, she kills the mom and... whoops.

1661
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:53,130
Wait, what?

1662
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:54,670
I just let you through.

1663
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,430
Why are you back here?

1664
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,920
I'm just gonna call them real quick.

1665
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,640
What floor did they live?

1666
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:08,920
I think it's the third floor, right?

1667
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,600
Oh, it's the first floor.

1668
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,000
Okay.

1669
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:13,300
6996.

1670
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:15,220
6...

1671
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:16,800
9...

1672
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,460
9...

1673
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,160
Wait, how did you get... why did you get back downstairs?

1674
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:22,240
I just caught...

1675
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,480
I just let you in.

1676
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,260
What if they're triplets?

1677
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,420
Maybe they're triplets.

1678
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:30,620
Where's your roommate?

1679
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,260
Okay, yeah.

1680
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:32,980
I was gonna say.

1681
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,080
Alright.

1682
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:34,620
Sorry.

1683
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,360
Let me...

1684
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,700
How would you know if you're on the list?

1685
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:39,860
Huh, ma'am?

1686
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,860
How would you know?

1687
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:47,160
Is it me or does the Bugmasters simulator look like Mark Grayson?

1688
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,140
Am I not going crazy?

1689
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,540
Or a very, very tired Mark Grayson?

1690
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:56,680
Alright, get outta here!

1691
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,040
That's right.

1692
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,360
We don't need no triplets here in my apartment.

1693
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:06,860
Nice.

1694
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,480
That was easy.

1695
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,720
Wait, this is an easy game.

1696
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,260
Or maybe I'm just really good.

1697
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,260
Could be both.

1698
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:14,720
Whoa.

1699
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:15,900
Wait, who are you?

1700
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,700
Wait, where the fuck do you live?

1701
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,740
Wait, how come...

1702
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:22,480
Wait, okay.

1703
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,020
McZooey Rodboys.

1704
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,180
Oh my god.

1705
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,280
He's the Rodman.

1706
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,220
He's here to finish Milkman's job.

1707
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,200
Okay, third floor.

1708
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,120
Third.

1709
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,680
McZooey Rodboys.

1710
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:51,000
964 964 516184 Retired.

1711
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,420
What did you mean by that?

1712
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,320
The triple D's.

1713
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,120
The triple D's.

1714
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,840
Nothing seems suspicious about you, sir.

1715
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,040
Yeah.

1716
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:05,180
Yeah.

1717
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,400
Him and the Rodboys.

1718
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,060
Why aren't you on the list, though?

1719
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:16,890
Why are there so many emergencies?

1720
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:18,990
What's going on in this city?

1721
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,630
Okay, let's see.

1722
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:24,550
4242

1723
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:35,610
4242 Wait, is he not the Rodboy?

1724
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,230
Who's your roommate?

1725
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:39,390
Oh, okay.

1726
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:40,370
They're all here anyway.

1727
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:41,950
Wait.

1728
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,490
Oh my god.

1729
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:45,070
It's the Rodboys?

1730
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:47,610
Oh my...

1731
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:49,390
You know what?

1732
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:53,750
I think... I feel like you should be up there instead of him.

1733
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:57,050
I...

1734
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:03,370
Honestly, I wish his name was the...

1735
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:07,090
You should be the one to live that life.

1736
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:09,610
God, the Rod.

1737
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:13,010
He is an actual improvement.

1738
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:14,610
Not gonna lie.

1739
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,610
Alright, get out of here.

1740
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:19,790
Rod over Rod.

1741
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:22,250
Rodboy sounds better.

1742
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,870
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1743
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:25,510
The Rodboys.

1744
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:31,290
The King or Rod versus Rod.

1745
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:35,530
In what year was the ultimate answer to life in everything published?

1746
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:35,910
Wait.

1747
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,710
1942?

1748
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,010
What would it be, guys?

1749
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:42,930
I don't understand.

1750
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:46,490
It was not for...

1751
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:47,690
Wait, what?

1752
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,310
But it's not 1979.

1753
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:50,990
Is he from the future?

1754
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:53,430
Oh, he is.

1755
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:54,850
Look, he has...

1756
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:55,910
He's a hippie.

1757
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:58,450
There's no hippies in 1955.

1758
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:00,270
What the fuck happened?

1759
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,170
What the fuck happened?

1760
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:04,850
Wait, what?

1761
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:05,730
There's a book?

1762
01:29:06,830 --> 01:29:08,190
Why is it 1979?

1763
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:11,630
There was no hippies in 1955.

1764
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,770
What book was it?

1765
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:15,650
What the...

1766
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:18,110
Oh, it's a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

1767
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,350
Some good shit.

1768
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:26,570
Oh, it's a Hitchhiker's Guide to the...

1769
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,910
Oh, the Hitchhiker's Guide was published that time.

1770
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:29,770
Oh, I didn't know that.

1771
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:31,430
See you tomorrow.

1772
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:31,990
Okay.

1773
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:47,410
Yeah, look.

1774
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,350
She didn't even give me any documentations.

1775
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,590
Like, she was not trying anymore.

1776
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:53,190
Like...

1777
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:56,590
If she...

1778
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:58,150
If she gave...

1779
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:08,630
If she gave me an ID or like papers, that's not discrimination if she never even tried.

1780
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:11,250
She gave up on entrance.

1781
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:17,570
She literally gave up.

1782
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:19,250
She gave me no papers.

1783
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:22,810
Alright.

1784
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,410
Yeah!

1785
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,530
I did it!

1786
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:26,570
That's pretty... That's so easy.

1787
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,250
Open detailed information.

1788
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:31,250
I didn't... See, look at that.

1789
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:33,010
Wait, double games have entered?

1790
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:36,450
Wait, but I captured... Oh, that have entered.

1791
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:37,270
Oh, nice.

1792
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:39,110
Nice.

1793
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:41,930
I did it.

1794
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:43,310
Alright, continue.

1795
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,150
Woah.

1796
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:46,190
What?

1797
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:47,930
Where am I?

1798
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:50,910
Where am I?

1799
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:51,710
Here are the rules.

1800
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:53,930
Where the fuck am I?

1801
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:57,710
Players take turns using one of their cards.

1802
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:00,230
You can only use a card equal or high.

1803
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:04,810
I can't believe my Oshi is people with dangling eyeballs.

1804
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:08,050
Actual demo.

1805
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:09,470
Thank you for the super chat.

1806
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,350
Thank you.

1807
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:11,930
J is... Oh my god.

1808
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:12,870
Is this...

1809
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,570
Is this math?

1810
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:17,330
What?

1811
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:26,370
You can only use a card equal or higher than the one on the table or a card of the same symbol regardless of value.

1812
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:36,210
J is worth 11, Q is worth 12, K is worth 13 and Aces are worth 1 and 14 when there is a K.

1813
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,030
What?

1814
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:40,970
Oh, and 14 when there is a K.

1815
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:41,970
Oh, okay.

1816
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:50,250
The first to use all their cards wins the round.

1817
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,440
Oh, equal or higher.

1818
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,020
Okay.

1819
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,400
Okay, I got this.

1820
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:08,000
I figured it out.

1821
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,280
Very well.

1822
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,360
Time to play.

1823
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:11,520
You start this round.

1824
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,920
I forgot what the points were.

1825
01:32:24,230 --> 01:32:24,870
Wait.

1826
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,410
Isn't queen higher?

1827
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:28,130
Oh, symbol.

1828
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:32,930
I did it.

1829
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,130
Okay.

1830
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:44,050
I'm doing it.

1831
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:55,750
Okay, I got a card.

1832
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:56,910
Grab a card.

1833
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:00,910
Yay!

1834
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:01,790
I won!

1835
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:03,510
Yay!

1836
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:04,850
Wait, what?

1837
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:07,270
Wait, what?

1838
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:08,690
Wait.

1839
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,390
But I won.

1840
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:17,930
But I won.

1841
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:22,170
But I won.

1842
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:22,510
I won.

1843
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:24,730
That's a 3.

1844
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,190
That's cheating.

1845
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:46,770
Maybe he won't have it.

1846
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,390
Yay!

1847
01:33:50,690 --> 01:33:51,290
Yay!

1848
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:54,430
I did it!

1849
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:56,070
I'm so good at cards.

1850
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:59,210
Only one day we will meet again.

1851
01:33:59,490 --> 01:33:59,870
Goodbye.

1852
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:02,030
Look at that.

1853
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:07,210
I might not have good gacha rules, but at least I'm good at cards.

1854
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:08,890
Mine.

1855
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,290
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1856
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:12,610
So easy.

1857
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,190
Alright, Wednesday.

1858
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:16,690
February 9th.

1859
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:18,230
Preferred party leader.

1860
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:23,610
Mr. Kepler will receive an award for founding the triple D's and his great work.

1861
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:26,050
A pair of spies have discovered an allied territory.

1862
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:28,190
Wait, is this World War 2?

1863
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:34,070
Although the enemy government claims to have no knowledge of this event and possibly...

1864
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:34,490
Wait, no.

1865
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:37,730
It's after World War 2.

1866
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,890
I'm sorry, I got my ears off.

1867
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:43,850
I saw allied territory.

1868
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,650
Sorry, it's the Cold War.

1869
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:48,690
Sorry, there's a lot of wars.

1870
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,590
I'm thinking about the Cold War.

1871
01:34:53,530 --> 01:35:01,310
So while we're dealing with doppelgangers, they're dealing with the paper police shit right now.

1872
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:02,510
Oh.

1873
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:04,590
They have their own paper police.

1874
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:07,710
But here in America, we have to deal with them.

1875
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:11,150
I feel like they got the better end of the deal.

1876
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:12,990
Because like...

1877
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:16,570
Theirs is more about political stuff.

1878
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:20,850
Ours is that we're getting slaughtered by people that look like us.

1879
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:22,770
And that's a lot more scarier.

1880
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:30,030
I feel like the other side is having a better time than us in regards to what's going on right now.

1881
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:35,070
Doppelgangers is a lot more worse.

1882
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:36,290
Yeah.

1883
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,530
Pretty much.

1884
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,030
Would you...

1885
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:50,350
I'd rather not be killed by someone that looks like someone I know.

1886
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:53,870
Ours is a lot scarier.

1887
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:54,070
Scarier.

1888
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:58,450
Alright.

1889
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:02,270
Alright.

1890
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:15,570
That's cool.

1891
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:17,450
No, Aunt Nora.

1892
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:20,570
Oh shit.

1893
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,110
Oh my god.

1894
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:27,890
Did you go to the Willy Wonka chocolate factory?

1895
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,570
Did you...

1896
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:31,390
Oh my god.

1897
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:32,830
What's wrong?

1898
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:36,370
My face is the face of an average human.

1899
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,550
Alright, Lois.

1900
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:44,170
I'll entertain you for a little bit.

1901
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:44,910
You know what?

1902
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:48,950
Lois the Liz.

1903
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:50,850
Why she...

1904
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:52,870
She went to the chocolate factory, okay?

1905
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:56,110
Alright, she got the golden ticket.

1906
01:36:56,570 --> 01:37:00,570
8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 9, 7, Oh man, Lois.

1907
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,570
Everything looks so good.

1908
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:06,630
Oh man.

1909
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:11,610
You worked so hard.

1910
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,000
Oh man.

1911
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,360
You worked so hard.

1912
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:24,660
It really is a shame that...

1913
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:25,820
Oh man.

1914
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:31,140
Just call.

1915
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,380
Just entertain her.

1916
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:32,900
You're right.

1917
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:36,220
I'll entertain her and call the phone too.

1918
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,960
She forgot her makeup today.

1919
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,520
If only you weren't earful.

1920
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:45,660
Alright, where's your roommate?

1921
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,500
Aw, and she wasn't home?

1922
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,540
Aw, Lois.

1923
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,640
Thank you for the super chat.

1924
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,600
Thank you, thank you.

1925
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,080
Don't be rude, Doki.

1926
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,140
She forgot her facial care today.

1927
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,600
Thank you for the super chat.

1928
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,660
Thank god.

1929
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,880
Aw, Lois.

1930
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,460
Now I just feel sad.

1931
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,100
You worked so hard.

1932
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,840
You had everything perfect, ma 'am.

1933
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,520
Like, just...

1934
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:15,280
Aw, just one little detail.

1935
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,900
Just one tiny detail.

1936
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,260
Doki, she just ate too many blueberries.

1937
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,820
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1938
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,380
I'm sorry.

1939
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,560
Alright, don't discriminate.

1940
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:36,160
She is beautiful.

1941
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,220
Alright.

1942
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,300
Oh!

1943
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:43,540
Okay.

1944
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,460
Okay.

1945
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,520
Okay.

1946
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,280
Maybe one too many hole.

1947
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,520
Sorry, I had to cover her face a little bit.

1948
01:38:58,700 --> 01:38:59,400
Guys!

1949
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,040
Guys, look.

1950
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:05,060
I didn't cover her face because I thought she was ugly, okay?

1951
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,820
I was just checking my list, guys.

1952
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:09,920
Look, see?

1953
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,520
I didn't cover her face this time.

1954
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,880
Alright, Gloria Schmidt.

1955
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:17,360
Okay.

1956
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,260
Two eyelashes.

1957
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,480
There's her...

1958
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:22,800
There's that.

1959
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:25,820
I'm a resident of 04-1974.

1960
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,440
The three, the triple D's.

1961
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:31,300
Yellow.

1962
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:31,940
I think...

1963
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:32,880
I mean, it's fine.

1964
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:33,820
Some people...

1965
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:35,740
Some people have yellow eyes.

1966
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:41,120
Oh my god, you're calling me fucking racist.

1967
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,260
What's wrong with yellow eyes?

1968
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,500
She could be wearing contacts, guys.

1969
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:47,640
5-1-2-3.

1970
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,600
5-1...

1971
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,760
Is yellow eyes the deal breaker?

1972
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,400
She has yellow eyes.

1973
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,220
She's a demon.

1974
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:00,340
Alright, is your wife at home?

1975
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:03,660
Alright, there you go.

1976
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:07,640
Not all yellow eye people are demons, guys.

1977
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,060
4-0-2.

1978
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:10,640
Okay.

1979
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,500
Where's her ID?

1980
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,220
Where did I put her ID?

1981
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,040
Okay, there it is.

1982
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,320
Uh...

1983
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,030
Her age?

1984
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:23,110
It doesn't even tell me what her age was.

1985
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,830
Uh...

1986
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:27,450
6-9-8-5-2-2-3-4-1.

1987
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:29,190
Alright.

1988
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:32,190
Alright, all of them seems fine.

1989
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:34,430
Alright.

1990
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:36,550
You're good to go, ma'am.

1991
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,270
And you're on the list too, Gloria.

1992
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:41,110
Wait, is her name actually Gloria?

1993
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,370
Wouldn't it be funny if her name was never Gloria?

1994
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:47,210
Alright.

1995
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:48,830
Go right in.

1996
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,230
Alright, child.

1997
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:57,850
Where's your entry request?

1998
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:01,250
Alright, let me call your mom.

1999
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:04,110
1-3-4-6.

2000
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:06,910
1-3-4...

2001
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:14,770
How could you let your child go outside without her documentation, ma'am?

2002
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:18,430
Alright.

2003
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:18,990
Well...

2004
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:21,910
Alright, they forgot their entry.

2005
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:22,450
Okay.

2006
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:24,930
Well, your mom backed you up.

2007
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:26,910
So all I have is this.

2008
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:30,150
Anastacia Michaelis.

2009
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:34,350
1-3-2-6-9-8-5-3-4- Triple D's.

2010
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:36,250
Hmm...

2011
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:40,250
The fact that you don't have your documentation...

2012
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:42,590
Hmm...

2013
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:43,550
I don't know.

2014
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:46,610
I don't know.

2015
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:48,450
I feel like...

2016
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:53,010
I feel like because you don't have it, then why should I let you in?

2017
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:57,310
I mean, can I just tell her to get her documentation?

2018
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:01,630
The mom alibi is 100%.

2019
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:05,610
Just because the mom is hot, you can't just believe everything she says, guys.

2020
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:13,930
Guys...

2021
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,270
We don't have any other information!

2022
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,530
Really, all I have is

2023
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:24,750
her...

2024
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:27,950
Seems that everything is perfect with my appearance.

2025
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:28,350
Alright.

2026
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:31,670
Um...

2027
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:33,430
Women never lie.

2028
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:36,390
Okay.

2029
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:37,530
Okay.

2030
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:37,610
Alright.

2031
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:39,510
She doesn't have it.

2032
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:42,810
Like, can I just... Can I send her away if she doesn't have it?

2033
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:48,250
Hmm...

2034
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:49,030
I don't know.

2035
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:49,490
Am I allowed...

2036
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:50,110
Do I say no?

2037
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:01,270
Oh no, that's her expiration date.

2038
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:03,690
That's the ID expiration date.

2039
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:06,290
Guys, that's not her birth date.

2040
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:08,770
That's like whenever her ID fucking expires.

2041
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:13,510
Ken.

2042
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:15,410
Come here.

2043
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,670
Tell your mom to come downstairs.

2044
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:18,690
I'll wait for her.

2045
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,610
Why can't I just call her mom?

2046
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,090
Like...

2047
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:24,470
Be like...

2048
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:26,530
Tell your mom to come downstairs.

2049
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:28,510
And fucking...

2050
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,950
Bring your entry date.

2051
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:32,090
Why do I have to... Oh my god.

2052
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:34,710
I did call her.

2053
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:36,860
She was just like... Yeah, I forgot to give her the...

2054
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:38,390
She was just like...

2055
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:39,770
I forgot to give her her entry.

2056
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:40,470
And then...

2057
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:41,790
That was it.

2058
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:43,510
I was like, okay.

2059
01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:45,510
Are you not coming down?

2060
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:46,410
I guess not.

2061
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:50,670
Oh my god.

2062
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:53,130
I guess I have to send you...

2063
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:53,970
Oh my god.

2064
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:56,490
Alright, if she kills the mom, it's not my fault.

2065
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:58,910
It's not my fault.

2066
01:43:59,490 --> 01:44:03,450
It's the mom's fault for not coming downstairs to give me her fucking...

2067
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:03,870
Wait.

2068
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:04,030
Wait.

2069
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:07,390
Whoa.

2070
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:11,090
The zen pic went hard, I guess.

2071
01:44:13,190 --> 01:44:13,990
Whoa.

2072
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:16,310
I mean, like...

2073
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:18,010
The shape of my head?

2074
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,850
What's so strange about it?

2075
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:22,470
It has a nice shape.

2076
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:25,090
I mean...

2077
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:25,830
Wow.

2078
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:33,450
Miss Potato.

2079
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:35,630
I mean, it is.

2080
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:37,170
She is Miss Potato's shape.

2081
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:38,650
Alright.

2082
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:39,850
I'm sorry.

2083
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:47,670
I don't think you were able to, like, fix the head of your shape in, like, ten minutes, ma'am.

2084
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:54,070
Thank you.

2085
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:56,090
I'm great at my job.

2086
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:01,000
Oh shit!

2087
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,140
What if I just let him through?

2088
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,580
Wait, she took off his hat for us!

2089
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,800
Oh my god, do you think he likes us?

2090
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:17,960
He's off, guys.

2091
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:19,060
He's off the clock.

2092
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:19,860
Oh, you're right.

2093
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:20,980
He's off.

2094
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:23,940
What if I just let him through looking at anything?

2095
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:25,640
Tempted.

2096
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:26,900
You know what?

2097
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,000
I don't need to check anything.

2098
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,440
Go right through.

2099
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:35,480
Why would you ask him anything?

2100
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:37,120
Go right through.

2101
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:39,720
You don't need any checks here.

2102
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:45,690
Bring him in.

2103
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:52,330
What is the number of different permutations of the most relevant The fuck does that mean?!

2104
01:45:53,690 --> 01:45:54,150
Okay.

2105
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:55,570
Google chat.

2106
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:02,730
42.

2107
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:04,110
Yes.

2108
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:08,590
Wait, why is it 17?

2109
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:12,510
42.

2110
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:13,890
Nice.

2111
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:15,890
Wait, is it actually 42?

2112
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:20,890
Wait, is that why the answer to life is 42?

2113
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:25,550
It's at least two.

2114
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:31,130
Guys, now I don't know.

2115
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:38,070
No.

2116
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:41,810
I can't believe.

2117
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:44,830
It's boob.

2118
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:47,950
You can google.

2119
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:51,950
Guys, why google if I have you guys here?

2120
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:55,770
I will put this as an answer if you don't tell me the real answer.

2121
01:46:56,350 --> 01:46:59,110
Why are you asking us?

2122
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:02,910
Oh, true.

2123
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,870
You're right, we're missing a number.

2124
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:08,850
We are in chat GPT.

2125
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:12,290
That's why there's chat in chat GPT, guys.

2126
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:13,750
Chat GPT.

2127
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:20,030
What is the number of different permutations of the most relevant Mersenne prime in computing?

2128
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:27,590
I feel like I am a fucking child.

2129
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,090
I am a child.

2130
01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:38,090
Guys, if you laugh at this, you're just as immature as me.

2131
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:40,430
You're just as immature.

2132
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:44,610
You are perfect.

2133
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:56,490
I wouldn't have it any other way.

2134
01:47:58,350 --> 01:47:59,550
Alright, guys.

2135
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:01,170
What's the actual number, guys?

2136
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,290
Is it 300?

2137
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:03,470
I don't even know.

2138
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:07,570
What the fuck is 302?

2139
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:10,750
302 40.

2140
01:48:11,230 --> 01:48:14,370
The fuck does that... I don't even...

2141
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:15,650
What does that even mean?

2142
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:18,510
Thank you, chat GPT.

2143
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:19,190
Wait.

2144
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:22,250
Oh, shit.

2145
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:25,910
Guys, I think I fucked up.

2146
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:31,270
Wait.

2147
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:33,690
Guys, I think...

2148
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:39,650
Oh, shit.

2149
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:42,030
Guys, I think I left...

2150
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:45,790
Guys, I think I fucked up.

2151
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:49,890
I think... Oh, shit.

2152
01:48:56,050 --> 01:48:58,830
Maybe this isn't the real one.

2153
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:02,210
Guys, it might not be the real one.

2154
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:04,750
Guys, he took off his hat.

2155
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:05,390
Okay?

2156
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:08,150
He took off his hat.

2157
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:12,250
Let them in.

2158
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:14,770
Turkey just left both of them.

2159
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:17,330
You know what's better than one milkman?

2160
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:19,410
Two milkman.

2161
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:21,310
4122.

2162
01:49:23,870 --> 01:49:24,510
4122.

2163
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:24,690
4122.

2164
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:33,190
Oh, shit.

2165
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:35,910
Wait.

2166
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:37,810
That's the fake milkman?

2167
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:39,990
Oh, shit.

2168
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:41,110
Did I got the right one?

2169
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:44,030
I got the right one.

2170
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:46,650
Oh, fuck.

2171
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:47,390
Wait.

2172
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:53,090
It looks the same.

2173
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:54,790
He's our milkman.

2174
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:55,410
Milkman?

2175
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,110
Never punish, guys.

2176
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:00,770
Never.

2177
01:50:02,910 --> 01:50:03,590
Numbers?

2178
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,790
They're the same numbers.

2179
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:05,230
Look.

2180
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:06,830
235... Oh.

2181
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:11,850
Sorry.

2182
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:15,310
I mean, they're not the same.

2183
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:17,210
They're not the same, guys.

2184
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:18,590
Okay.

2185
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:19,590
Alright.

2186
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:20,570
Never punish.

2187
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:21,430
Let's go.

2188
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:23,470
No.

2189
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:24,990
Let him in, too.

2190
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:25,650
Turkey.

2191
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:27,650
Let him in.

2192
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:30,510
Hey.

2193
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:30,910
Nice.

2194
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:31,630
He did it.

2195
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:34,290
I can count.

2196
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:35,350
Let's go.

2197
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:37,630
Louis.

2198
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:39,030
Oh, is this a real Louis?

2199
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:41,630
I mean, you have this.

2200
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:42,830
You have the bow.

2201
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:45,130
You have the circular.

2202
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:46,690
What does it matter?

2203
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:52,170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... There's no way that shit... There's no way that's gonna fuck with me.

2204
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:53,610
Alright, where's everything?

2205
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:57,890
Alright, at least we have this.

2206
01:50:58,530 --> 01:50:59,780
Okay, this is...

2207
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:01,030
Floor 1.

2208
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:01,590
Okay.

2209
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:05,050
Louis Dolinsky.

2210
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:07,810
Uh... Floor 1.

2211
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:10,150
Alright, let me talk to your husband real quick.

2212
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:12,090
I said, what the fuck you're doing?

2213
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:15,390
Bro, she... Guys, she remembered her makeup this time.

2214
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:16,510
She came back.

2215
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:19,610
Guys, she came back to put on makeup.

2216
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:21,010
1, 1, 5, 2.

2217
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:24,570
1, 1, 5, 2.

2218
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,300
Alright.

2219
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,840
Is your roommate here?

2220
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:38,420
Is your wife, your roommate here?

2221
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,960
That's not your... Oh, wait.

2222
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,480
I forgot to ask him about her ID card.

2223
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:46,260
1, 1, 5, 2.

2224
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:49,120
Sorry, I gotta call back about the ID.

2225
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:54,240
Hello?

2226
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:54,680
Roman?

2227
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:57,140
Okay.

2228
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:00,280
Can you come downstairs to give it to her?

2229
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,040
No?

2230
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:01,800
Alright.

2231
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:02,940
Fuck me, I guess.

2232
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,300
I definitely don't get paid enough for it.

2233
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:05,740
Alright.

2234
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:08,880
I mean, it seems like everything looks good to go.

2235
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:10,880
Can I talk about your appearance?

2236
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:12,500
You're not purple.

2237
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,460
I mean, you're not purple though, so are you really perfect?

2238
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:19,760
Nope.

2239
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:20,940
Yep, yep, yep.

2240
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:23,920
Alright.

2241
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,160
Go right in.

2242
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,280
Go right in.

2243
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:30,460
Go right in.

2244
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:31,480
I believe she's real.

2245
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:37,430
Wait, what?

2246
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:46,390
Wait, why is it A?

2247
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:49,630
I did everything perfectly.

2248
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:55,500
Oh!

2249
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,660
But like, she never gave me her ID!

2250
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,100
She doesn't even give me her ID!

2251
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:11,440
What do I check?

2252
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,420
Do I just say yes?

2253
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:18,100
No, it says like...

2254
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:25,190
Oh, is it just right?

2255
01:53:25,330 --> 01:53:26,210
Do I just say right?

2256
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:30,750
Oh yeah, I didn't care.

2257
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,870
Oh, I put...

2258
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:35,730
I put yes.

2259
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:37,550
There's a person...

2260
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:39,390
He's on my list though.

2261
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:39,870
It...

2262
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,470
It's not fair!

2263
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:45,710
He was on my personal list.

2264
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:46,890
I should get out.

2265
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,510
He's on our list, guys.

2266
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,530
He was on our list.

2267
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:56,310
I didn't care.

2268
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:59,350
It might have been the true...

2269
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:03,790
Okay.

2270
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:07,030
The people...

2271
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:09,110
Yeah, he is the people's milkman.

2272
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:09,730
Chat.

2273
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:11,290
Alright.

2274
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:14,690
What's today's news?

2275
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:39,370
I see her husband has been acting suspiciously.

2276
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:40,490
Suspiciously.

2277
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:41,330
Coming home late.

2278
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:43,030
Not giving her the same attention as before.

2279
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:45,050
And always having important...

2280
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:46,430
Work...

2281
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:47,310
Ah, yes.

2282
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:49,410
Important work meeting with the milkman.

2283
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:53,250
He is a menace to society.

2284
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:57,010
Taking away our husbands and wives.

2285
01:54:57,510 --> 01:54:59,670
My husband wasn't like this.

2286
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:00,570
Says the woman.

2287
01:55:03,550 --> 01:55:04,210
My god.

2288
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:07,090
He's taking our husbands and our wives?

2289
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:09,890
Won't anybody stop him?

2290
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:12,410
Stop the milkman.

2291
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:16,070
Important meetings.

2292
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:18,410
Oh, he's back.

2293
01:55:18,770 --> 01:55:19,390
Good afternoon.

2294
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:20,370
Hello there.

2295
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:22,330
Alright, Lois.

2296
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:25,150
I mean, everything else looks correct.

2297
01:55:27,410 --> 01:55:28,270
There's our mom.

2298
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:30,410
I mean, I looked at your information.

2299
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:32,670
Oh, you remember your ID this time.

2300
01:55:33,330 --> 01:55:35,110
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

2301
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:36,330
Thank you, thank you.

2302
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:37,310
Milk.

2303
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:42,890
89456973 Uh...

2304
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:44,030
Oh, wait.

2305
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:45,390
Nevermind.

2306
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:47,170
Get out.

2307
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:52,540
Get out, Lois.

2308
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:56,940
Yeah, you thought because I can't read, I wouldn't catch that?

2309
01:55:57,140 --> 01:55:58,220
That's fucking right.

2310
01:55:58,820 --> 01:55:59,940
Get out of here!

2311
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:05,730
Oh, she's the other twin.

2312
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:06,470
Illinois.

2313
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:09,570
33...

2314
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:11,370
mole to the right, triangle.

2315
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:13,070
Everything looks right.

2316
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:14,290
Oh, wait, where's your ID?

2317
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:19,030
Okay, well, let's see what your fucking twin says.

2318
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:21,650
Wait, where does she live again?

2319
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:23,810
I'm not remembering where people live.

2320
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:26,170
Floor, fourth floor.

2321
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:27,210
Uh...

2322
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:28,930
6996...

2323
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:32,730
6...9...

2324
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:34,810
9...

2325
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:40,830
6...

2326
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:42,370
What do you mean, earrings?

2327
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:45,070
It's a triangle.

2328
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:50,050
Wait.

2329
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:54,130
What's wrong with earrings?

2330
01:56:54,530 --> 01:56:55,490
It looks the same.

2331
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:57,150
See?

2332
01:56:57,270 --> 01:56:58,110
Triangles.

2333
01:56:58,350 --> 01:56:59,190
Triangles.

2334
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:02,590
Illinois always has triangle earrings, guys.

2335
01:57:03,470 --> 01:57:04,570
Look at it.

2336
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:06,730
Look, see?

2337
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:09,390
You're talking about the other.

2338
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:12,970
You're talking about her other sister, guys.

2339
01:57:15,150 --> 01:57:17,970
Her other sister is the square.

2340
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:18,730
Oh, I forgot.

2341
01:57:18,910 --> 01:57:19,230
Sorry.

2342
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:21,790
It's because I wanted to call her again.

2343
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:24,450
Maybe if I call her enough, she'll give me her number.

2344
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:26,970
That I already have.

2345
01:57:30,490 --> 01:57:35,390
Okay, what happened to your sister's documents?

2346
01:57:35,870 --> 01:57:37,350
Okay, it is in the apartment.

2347
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:40,950
Yep, I want her to...

2348
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:44,770
I want her consensually to give her number to me.

2349
01:57:46,770 --> 01:57:50,130
Not because I have her number because of my job.

2350
01:57:51,650 --> 01:57:52,870
Alright, let's see.

2351
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:59,170
I mean, like, everything looks correct.

2352
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:04,350
I don't know if anything else looks wrong.

2353
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:06,030
I just don't have her ID.

2354
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:10,250
Yeah, I just don't have her ID.

2355
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:11,810
There's nothing else that's wrong.

2356
01:58:12,230 --> 01:58:13,750
Alright, go in.

2357
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:14,850
It's not reverse.

2358
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:16,470
Oh my god, now you're fucking with me.

2359
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:20,330
Now you're fucking...

2360
01:58:20,330 --> 01:58:22,070
That's her twin, guys!

2361
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:24,730
That's her twin!

2362
01:58:26,770 --> 01:58:27,250
She's...

2363
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:30,530
Guys, this is why me and Illinois...

2364
01:58:30,530 --> 01:58:31,930
That's why she'll pick me over you guys.

2365
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:34,150
I can tell the difference between the twins.

2366
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:36,430
You can't.

2367
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:41,410
You're looking for a real partner.

2368
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:43,870
And I know the difference.

2369
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:45,770
Alright, you can go in.

2370
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:48,930
I mean, I don't...

2371
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:52,070
I don't have your ID card.

2372
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:53,110
Do I pick yes?

2373
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:54,510
I guess yes, right?

2374
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:57,450
You're on the list, yeah.

2375
01:58:57,450 --> 01:58:58,370
You are, okay.

2376
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,370
Yeah, go right in.

2377
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:03,330
Perfect.

2378
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:09,810
Oh my god.

2379
01:59:14,430 --> 01:59:15,790
I'm like...

2380
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,930
Did you even try?

2381
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:19,210
Why did you come back?

2382
01:59:21,770 --> 01:59:24,470
I trusted you again?

2383
01:59:25,410 --> 01:59:28,550
Ma'am, if it doesn't work the first time...

2384
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:32,230
Why would it work a second time?

2385
01:59:34,610 --> 01:59:37,130
Surely it won't work this time.

2386
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:39,690
Maybe they have a different doorman.

2387
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:42,190
She should've went...

2388
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:44,270
I'm sorry, I had to add shift, guys.

2389
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:46,850
Why did you go to a different shift?

2390
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:48,810
The fuck?

2391
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:55,050
Oh, is it the whole alphabet equals numbers shit?

2392
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:56,830
Guys, alright.

2393
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:59,490
Any math prodigies in my chat?

2394
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:00,470
Is it 42?

2395
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:05,170
At least she's...

2396
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:07,690
No, she didn't even try at all.

2397
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:14,160
Guys, what's the numbers?

2398
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:19,260
40, just look up the...

2399
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,400
Just look up the wiki.

2400
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:27,320
42069 42069

2401
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:34,440
42069 42069 Okay, sorry.

2402
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:36,040
You're so silly.

2403
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:40,260
Guys, okay.

2404
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:49,120
ChatGPT, what is M-V-W-K-Z-I-E-X-N plus W-F-L-T-E-N-X

2405
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:55,670
Alright, thank you, ChatGPT.

2406
02:00:55,850 --> 02:00:56,490
Thank you.

2407
02:00:57,930 --> 02:00:59,790
Oh my god, I love streaming.

2408
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,020
Alright.

2409
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:09,260
Good afternoon.

2410
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:10,540
Hello, sir.

2411
02:01:12,140 --> 02:01:13,240
Mr. Red Boys.

2412
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:18,280
Have you ever thought about changing your name to Rod Boys, sir?

2413
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,420
I think you'd like...

2414
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:26,300
I think you'd enjoy it a lot more if you were called the Rod Boys.

2415
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,020
3-3 Okay.

2416
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:31,040
What clue?

2417
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,600
9-6-4-5-1 6-1-8-4

2418
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:40,280
I miss...

2419
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,700
I miss Mr. Rod Boy.

2420
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:46,500
I mean, everything looks good.

2421
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,940
Let me call your son real quick.

2422
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,680
4... I forgot the number.

2423
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:58,920
4-2-4-2 4-2-4-2 I don't trust a man.

2424
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,040
Yeah, but you trust a milkman.

2425
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:03,700
How come you trust a milkman, huh?

2426
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:08,040
I mean, everything seems correct.

2427
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:11,160
Triple D's.

2428
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,600
Triple... Is that D?

2429
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:14,840
Triple D.

2430
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:20,420
Except his name isn't Rod Boy.

2431
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:23,560
Alright, go right in, sir.

2432
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,100
Wait, are you on the list?

2433
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:28,080
Oh, you are.

2434
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:29,520
Come right in, sir.

2435
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,120
Everything looks good.

2436
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,720
Don't worry.

2437
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:39,980
I don't remember it.

2438
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:40,780
I think... yeah.

2439
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:42,100
It looks the same.

2440
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:43,300
What's your ID?

2441
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:46,440
Nice.

2442
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:46,740
Alright.

2443
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:48,060
Isaac Goss.

2444
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,460
Look at that handsome man.

2445
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,320
Alright.

2446
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:53,840
Uh...

2447
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:58,120
2-2 Isaac Goss.

2448
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:04,340
4-5-6-9-8-5-5-1-2 Yeah.

2449
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,580
Everything looks good.

2450
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:08,400
Oh my god, I'm getting really good at this.

2451
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,540
Now I just gotta call.

2452
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,380
Just to be sure.

2453
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:15,980
I know you're not lying to me.

2454
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,820
But I just gotta be sure, you know?

2455
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:24,050
Alright, nice.

2456
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:26,190
Alright, go right in, sir.

2457
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:28,590
Go right in.

2458
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:35,200
Woah.

2459
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:37,120
You're awfully happy today.

2460
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,980
Where's your...

2461
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:41,000
Why aren't you on the list?

2462
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:44,140
There can't all be emergencies.

2463
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,120
Why are they...

2464
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:49,860
Why are all their excuses just emergencies?

2465
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,080
Like...

2466
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:52,060
What the fuck...

2467
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:55,640
Did a fucking bank explode or something?

2468
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:57,380
I didn't even get to handle...

2469
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:58,920
Handle the money?

2470
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:03,400
There can't all be emergencies, Margaret.

2471
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:07,160
Two eyelashes.

2472
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:09,220
Big smile.

2473
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:14,400
Okay, where does Margaret live?

2474
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:15,600
Second floor.

2475
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:16,940
Third.

2476
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:22,690
Margaret Bubbles.

2477
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:28,970
1-0-3-2-6-8-0-1-4 6-4-3-1 I'm res'ing the building.

2478
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:29,970
Triple D's.

2479
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:30,710
Margaret.

2480
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:32,710
Bubbles.

2481
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:34,590
Yeah, seems fine.

2482
02:04:35,390 --> 02:04:43,530
6-4-3-1 6-4-3-1 Never trust anyone named Bubbles.

2483
02:04:45,290 --> 02:04:47,190
Not even Bubbles from the past?

2484
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:48,410
Oh, nobody's home.

2485
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:50,670
I guess you're free to come in.

2486
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:54,090
Alright, go right in, Margaret.

2487
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:57,190
Doesn't seem pretty...

2488
02:04:57,190 --> 02:04:58,090
Doesn't seem suspicious.

2489
02:04:58,730 --> 02:04:59,830
But you were just here.

2490
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,540
Okay, wait, let me call just to be sure.

2491
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:10,260
Didn't I let you in?

2492
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:14,460
I'm pretty sure I let you in, right?

2493
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,560
Oh, they're all blurring together.

2494
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:17,440
I can't remember.

2495
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:24,760
Wait, 1-1-5-2 1-1-5-2 What's that yesterday?

2496
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,120
What was that yesterday?

2497
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,900
They're all blurring together.

2498
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:35,940
Wait, I did it?

2499
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:42,020
Oh, I kicked out your impostor!

2500
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,200
I'm sorry, ma'am.

2501
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:44,520
I'm sorry.

2502
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,760
They're all blurring together.

2503
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:55,880
8-9-4-5-6-9-7-2-3 Lois Stilinski Stilinski They're all blurring together, ma'am.

2504
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:56,420
I'm sorry.

2505
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:57,820
I didn't mean it.

2506
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,160
I mean, you look alright.

2507
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:01,520
So you know what?

2508
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:02,060
You're in.

2509
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:07,720
The purple is orange.

2510
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:14,260
And you're not purple too!

2511
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:16,260
Look at that.

2512
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,440
Good for you.

2513
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,120
Come right in.

2514
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:20,080
Oh, yeah.

2515
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:23,660
I didn't ask about- It's fine.

2516
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:27,400
I know she's not- It's fine.

2517
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:29,940
Oh, shit!

2518
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:35,080
My other eye is for better vision.

2519
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:39,560
Okay.

2520
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:39,720
Okay.

2521
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:47,780
He opened his third eye.

2522
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,560
That checks out.

2523
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:51,260
Yeah, that seems right.

2524
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:53,800
I'm so good at this game.

2525
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:55,160
Wait, this game is so easy.

2526
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,620
Wait.

2527
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:00,970
Wait.

2528
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,510
Aren't you with the husband?

2529
02:07:04,570 --> 02:07:05,110
Wait.

2530
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:07,630
Was I just talking to him?

2531
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:13,330
Um...

2532
02:07:13,870 --> 02:07:15,450
Was I not just talking to him?

2533
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:17,330
To a Mr. Roman- Mr. Stilinski?

2534
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:18,270
Oh, okay.

2535
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:28,710
Um...

2536
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:30,030
Goodbye.

2537
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:36,470
Guys.

2538
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:40,350
These guys gotta check the schedule.

2539
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:45,810
Mr. Roman Stilinski is already home.

2540
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:48,030
I think on A, I fucked up one of them.

2541
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:48,830
Yeah.

2542
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:50,830
Which one was it?

2543
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:55,350
Who the fuck was Ellen?

2544
02:07:55,670 --> 02:07:56,110
Oh!

2545
02:07:56,230 --> 02:07:57,910
Oh, and she doesn't have- Oh!

2546
02:07:59,390 --> 02:07:59,830
Whoops.

2547
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:01,470
Yeah, I fucked up Margaret.

2548
02:08:01,850 --> 02:08:03,710
And, uh...

2549
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:04,490
The model.

2550
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:07,010
When does the game get harder?

2551
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:13,150
Yeah, that's right.

2552
02:08:13,170 --> 02:08:14,030
I'm getting a little cocky.

2553
02:08:14,030 --> 02:08:15,470
Wait, let me see.

2554
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:18,290
Let me see.

2555
02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:21,250
I think I want some appropriate music going on here.

2556
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:24,870
Let me get some appropriate music here.

2557
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:26,770
Let's see.

2558
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:31,150
I'm just saying.

2559
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:31,850
Okay.

2560
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,730
Copyright free.

2561
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:36,850
Hotel music.

2562
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:41,810
Hotel music.

2563
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:44,510
Hotel, no copyright music.

2564
02:08:44,690 --> 02:08:47,590
Yeah, that's what I- Oh, hotel lobby music.

2565
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:50,650
Alright, do I wanna- You know what?

2566
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:51,810
Fuck it.

2567
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:55,150
Guys, I'm gonna get copyright- Wait, actually royalty free music.

2568
02:08:55,730 --> 02:08:57,150
Hotel lobby music.

2569
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:58,230
Copyright free.

2570
02:08:58,430 --> 02:08:58,690
Alright.

2571
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:01,290
If I get a copyright strike, I swear to God.

2572
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:08,650
Yeah, let's put this on repeat.

2573
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:10,390
Fuck it.

2574
02:09:10,710 --> 02:09:13,070
YouTube on repeat.

2575
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:16,030
I won't get immersed, guys.

2576
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:18,550
I'm here to get immersed, guys.

2577
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:19,910
Alright.

2578
02:09:22,670 --> 02:09:23,270
Let's see.

2579
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:28,390
I need to make sure I don't accidentally- Alright.

2580
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:29,390
Let's see.

2581
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:30,930
Oh, no.

2582
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:34,470
They're like, turn off your ad block.

2583
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:36,090
I'll be like, okay.

2584
02:09:36,830 --> 02:09:38,270
What's the point?

2585
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:45,470
Give me my hotel lobby music!

2586
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:46,250
There you go.

2587
02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:47,730
Alright.

2588
02:09:48,230 --> 02:09:49,710
Now I can be fully immersed.

2589
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:53,070
Fully immersed in my hotel lobby.

2590
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:58,650
No, I'm looking at the- The area.

2591
02:09:58,650 --> 02:09:59,270
Area.

2592
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:02,430
Alright.

2593
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:08,250
The double- The triple D breaks the record for doppelgangers captured in a week.

2594
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:10,650
War again?

2595
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:15,550
The government announced that they already have a plan of action against the latest movements of enemy countries.

2596
02:10:16,530 --> 02:10:20,430
A new baby joins the growing numbers of fatherless children in their communities.

2597
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:21,890
Something never seen before.

2598
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:25,430
So far, no mother has decided to speak about it.

2599
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:27,190
Oh my god.

2600
02:10:27,390 --> 02:10:32,670
The milkman's going- He's aiming for non-housewives now?

2601
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,650
Oh my god.

2602
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:37,330
Won't somebody stop him?

2603
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:40,850
He's after the non-housewives.

2604
02:10:41,070 --> 02:10:43,330
He is going out of control.

2605
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:47,890
Can someone stop this man?

2606
02:10:48,870 --> 02:10:50,630
He strikes again.

2607
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:53,070
Good afternoon.

2608
02:10:53,070 --> 02:10:55,250
I don't know, that's- Okay, Alf.

2609
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:58,270
Oh, you're Cappuccini!

2610
02:11:00,830 --> 02:11:02,290
Where's your ID?

2611
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:04,610
Okay, Cappuccini.

2612
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:05,570
Cappuccin.

2613
02:11:06,850 --> 02:11:07,210
Cappuccino.

2614
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:09,190
Can't keep getting away with this.

2615
02:11:09,370 --> 02:11:10,010
I know, right?

2616
02:11:10,930 --> 02:11:11,830
Fourth floor.

2617
02:11:12,590 --> 02:11:13,690
Okay, lawyer.

2618
02:11:14,210 --> 02:11:16,790
I mean, Cappuccin.

2619
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:20,990
4258.

2620
02:11:22,150 --> 02:11:22,590
4258.

2621
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:24,090
I mean, Triple D is correct.

2622
02:11:24,890 --> 02:11:25,330
4258.

2623
02:11:28,470 --> 02:11:28,910
4258.

2624
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:34,150
Wait, he doesn't have the monocle?

2625
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:36,250
Maybe he put it on for fun.

2626
02:11:40,110 --> 02:11:43,850
Okay, so her husband's- Oh shit, sorry, I need to call again.

2627
02:11:46,330 --> 02:11:46,770
4258.

2628
02:11:46,830 --> 02:11:47,410
Oh shit.

2629
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:49,250
4258.

2630
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:50,730
I mean, it looks like that.

2631
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:53,370
I forgot to talk about his ID again.

2632
02:11:56,490 --> 02:11:56,970
4258.

2633
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:00,230
Cappuccino.

2634
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:04,050
Y'all, don't be fooled.

2635
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:06,350
The real Doki never made it past the store.

2636
02:12:06,570 --> 02:12:11,150
I don't know what this is, but don't believe the not.

2637
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:14,770
Thank you for the magenta soup.

2638
02:12:15,010 --> 02:12:16,250
Thank you, thank you.

2639
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:17,250
Alright.

2640
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:19,990
I mean, everything looks good, Mr. Cappuccino.

2641
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:23,230
No ID card.

2642
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:25,570
Wait, do I say yes when he doesn't have it?

2643
02:12:25,630 --> 02:12:26,110
I forgot.

2644
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:27,710
No, I say no.

2645
02:12:27,950 --> 02:12:30,310
And then, yes, you look like him.

2646
02:12:30,810 --> 02:12:31,930
He wears a monocle.

2647
02:12:32,810 --> 02:12:34,570
And yeah, you're on the list.

2648
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:36,290
Alright, go right in.

2649
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:38,470
And if you're not him, well, I guess...

2650
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:40,790
I guess sucks to be the wife right now.

2651
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:45,800
Swirl.

2652
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:46,820
Swirl.

2653
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:47,940
The eyes.

2654
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:50,000
Yep, seems right.

2655
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:52,380
Swirl.

2656
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:53,660
I say guys.

2657
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:56,900
At this point, I'm gonna remember the fucking 2-2.

2658
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:58,500
I'm gonna remember his, like...

2659
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:00,060
All I need to do is remember his ID number.

2660
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:02,520
456985512.

2661
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:03,840
Let's do a speedrun.

2662
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:07,140
7-3-3-2.

2663
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:08,760
Alright.

2664
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,080
It's Superman.

2665
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:11,800
Superman is coming back from the Daily Planet.

2666
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:15,200
Oh, okay.

2667
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:17,120
Yeah, seems right.

2668
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,040
Nothing suspicious here.

2669
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:21,280
Oh, wait.

2670
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:23,080
Where the triple D at?

2671
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:24,120
Sir.

2672
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:30,320
Oh, you don't see any problem with your application request?

2673
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:33,940
You think you can get in here with a fake entry request?

2674
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:35,300
Get out of here.

2675
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:43,300
I don't know if you're a natural doppelganger, but like, if we accidentally killed an innocent person, then that's...

2676
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:50,500
Imagine if it was just the reporter couldn't find his entry request, and then he got it forged and everything.

2677
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:51,520
Um...

2678
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:56,040
Goodbye, Superman.

2679
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:57,680
That's right.

2680
02:13:57,860 --> 02:14:00,360
I'm gonna finish his job.

2681
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:02,280
I'm gonna finish Lex Luthor's job.

2682
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:07,280
Imagine if he wasn't even, like, a doppelganger.

2683
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:09,660
He just fucking forged his entry request.

2684
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:13,140
The printer just ran...

2685
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:15,400
The printer just ran out of ink.

2686
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:15,840
God.

2687
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:17,640
Alright.

2688
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,100
Well, you're not in the list.

2689
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:23,100
Because I allude to a work...

2690
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:28,680
How many work emerges... Okay, Mr. William Afton, if that is your real name.

2691
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:30,960
Okay.

2692
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,520
William Afton.

2693
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:34,620
Okay, one, one.

2694
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:35,800
Wait, no.

2695
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:36,880
One, three.

2696
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:38,500
Two, five.

2697
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:39,600
Okay, yeah.

2698
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:40,200
Goodbye.

2699
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:41,520
Yeah.

2700
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:42,920
That's right.

2701
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,740
Only one man can kill children.

2702
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:46,760
We don't need two children killers.

2703
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:52,640
He always comes back.

2704
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:55,220
A work emergency.

2705
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:56,940
He killed another kid.

2706
02:14:57,460 --> 02:14:59,840
He's waiting every night.

2707
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,040
Hello.

2708
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:02,660
Oh, yay.

2709
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:04,940
The other sister.

2710
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:06,000
The hotter one.

2711
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,380
Okay, three, three.

2712
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:12,740
Alright, everything in the picture seems alright.

2713
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:16,340
She's the hotter sister.

2714
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:21,040
Okay, let's see.

2715
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:23,360
What is it for?

2716
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:24,100
First floor.

2717
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:29,460
And then E, S, V, R, C, H, Z, T.

2718
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,660
Where's your ID?

2719
02:15:35,180 --> 02:15:35,620
Okay.

2720
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:38,080
7, 8, 5, 6, 1, 3, 6, 9.

2721
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:39,440
Okay, 6, 9, 9, 6.

2722
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:44,880
6, 9, 9, 6.

2723
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:46,800
Hello, ma'am.

2724
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:50,080
Can I talk to the hotter sister, please?

2725
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:55,150
Where's your roommate?

2726
02:15:56,710 --> 02:15:57,150
Okay.

2727
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:57,590
Alright.

2728
02:15:57,590 --> 02:15:58,930
That seems good for me.

2729
02:15:59,050 --> 02:16:00,330
Go right in.

2730
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:02,730
Nice.

2731
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:07,190
Why is she the hotter one?

2732
02:16:08,190 --> 02:16:13,510
The secret is that you always tell the other twin that she's the hotter one of the...

2733
02:16:13,510 --> 02:16:15,170
She's the hottest of the twins.

2734
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:17,570
That's my secret.

2735
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:21,070
You always tell one of the twins that they're the hotter one.

2736
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:24,570
That's funny.

2737
02:16:30,330 --> 02:16:30,970
Alright.

2738
02:16:31,910 --> 02:16:32,510
Robertski.

2739
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:34,710
Okay.

2740
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:36,090
Triple D, triple D.

2741
02:16:36,210 --> 02:16:37,150
That's evil.

2742
02:16:37,550 --> 02:16:39,090
How many twins do you meet?

2743
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:43,970
I've never tested it in theory yet.

2744
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:46,450
Look, it's a theory, guys.

2745
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:48,790
I've never tested it out.

2746
02:16:50,690 --> 02:16:51,330
Peachman.

2747
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:53,870
Floor 1, 2.

2748
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:54,930
Oh, he's a shoemaker.

2749
02:16:58,970 --> 02:17:01,450
Any twins in here to test this out?

2750
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:05,810
1, 1, 4, 6, 5, 2, 2, 8, 9.

2751
02:17:07,910 --> 02:17:12,290
2, 6, 6, 8.

2752
02:17:15,210 --> 02:17:15,650
Stop.

2753
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:16,390
Step 1.

2754
02:17:16,450 --> 02:17:18,870
I need to find some twins to test this theory out.

2755
02:17:19,170 --> 02:17:21,230
I mean, you guys can test it out for me, right?

2756
02:17:23,370 --> 02:17:23,810
Okay.

2757
02:17:24,510 --> 02:17:25,590
That was a dad, right?

2758
02:17:25,590 --> 02:17:25,710
Okay.

2759
02:17:28,030 --> 02:17:29,290
Oh, Robertski.

2760
02:17:29,390 --> 02:17:31,010
Okay, Robertski, Peachman.

2761
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:32,930
I mean, everything looks good.

2762
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:35,730
Robertski.

2763
02:17:36,270 --> 02:17:36,870
Yep.

2764
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:39,410
Wait, are you a shoemaker?

2765
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:40,050
You are.

2766
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:41,770
Go right in.

2767
02:17:44,210 --> 02:17:45,670
Go right in.

2768
02:17:46,190 --> 02:17:47,830
I'm zooming past this.

2769
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:49,810
I shall beat Harry.

2770
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:50,590
Or Henry.

2771
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:51,910
Whoever his name was.

2772
02:17:52,230 --> 02:17:53,270
Oh, it was the blue green.

2773
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:54,490
Oh my God, it's the mom.

2774
02:17:56,410 --> 02:17:57,350
Natcha.

2775
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,870
Okay, Natcha.

2776
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:01,110
Natcha Malachski.

2777
02:18:01,770 --> 02:18:03,110
Triple D, triple D.

2778
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:04,070
1973.

2779
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:06,690
204.

2780
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:08,470
Left eye green.

2781
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:09,110
Oh.

2782
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:15,550
Okay.

2783
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:19,230
Alright.

2784
02:18:19,650 --> 02:18:20,070
Nice.

2785
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:22,870
See, I know my left and right.

2786
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:28,770
No, that was her right eye.

2787
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:31,590
Left eye.

2788
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:33,250
Left eye is this.

2789
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:35,250
This is right.

2790
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:39,010
Wait,

2791
02:18:45,950 --> 02:18:46,490
her...

2792
02:18:53,470 --> 02:18:57,130
Okay, if I detain her daughter, there won't be any orphans today.

2793
02:18:57,290 --> 02:19:03,810
If her daughter shows up, there won't be...

2794
02:19:06,930 --> 02:19:10,370
I'll just need her daughter to show up.

2795
02:19:10,870 --> 02:19:12,090
And then...

2796
02:19:12,090 --> 02:19:14,190
No one will know.

2797
02:19:15,590 --> 02:19:17,510
No one will know.

2798
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:21,930
Okay.

2799
02:19:21,930 --> 02:19:23,070
Okay.

2800
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:27,610
There won't be any orphans if her daughter shows up.

2801
02:19:27,690 --> 02:19:29,230
I see gods.

2802
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:30,290
Okay.

2803
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:34,130
No witnesses.

2804
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:36,290
Okay.

2805
02:19:40,410 --> 02:19:44,110
1, 2, 3, 7, 3, 3, 2.

2806
02:19:44,450 --> 02:19:47,230
Guys, I might have went a little too fast.

2807
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:47,850
Guys.

2808
02:19:47,850 --> 02:19:47,910
Guys.

2809
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:52,830
I got a little silly.

2810
02:19:56,970 --> 02:19:57,530
Okay.

2811
02:19:59,150 --> 02:20:01,010
I mean, it looks about right.

2812
02:20:04,650 --> 02:20:05,630
Nice, alright.

2813
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:09,710
Getting right in.

2814
02:20:10,950 --> 02:20:15,590
Alright, now that I'm being a little silly, maybe we should turn the music off.

2815
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:18,110
Haha.

2816
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:24,430
The music made me a little too silly.

2817
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:25,730
Wait, you were just here.

2818
02:20:27,990 --> 02:20:28,430
Wait.

2819
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:31,670
Oh, is she dead?

2820
02:20:32,330 --> 02:20:33,490
Did I send in the wrong...

2821
02:20:33,490 --> 02:20:36,150
Okay, let's see if I sent in the right twin or not.

2822
02:20:40,350 --> 02:20:40,790
69966...

2823
02:20:42,190 --> 02:20:42,630
9...

2824
02:20:45,210 --> 02:20:45,650
9...

2825
02:20:45,650 --> 02:20:48,150
6... Did I send in the wrong twin?

2826
02:20:52,350 --> 02:20:53,790
Alright, pick up.

2827
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:03,370
Wait, the other twin was there.

2828
02:21:03,710 --> 02:21:04,610
Hahahaha.

2829
02:21:25,090 --> 02:21:25,540
Whoops.

2830
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:27,920
Whoops.

2831
02:21:29,980 --> 02:21:30,880
Um...

2832
02:21:34,220 --> 02:21:35,120
Um...

2833
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:44,530
But I know she's not... Oh.

2834
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:49,210
Oh, that's awkward.

2835
02:21:54,030 --> 02:21:56,290
Oh, that's a little...

2836
02:21:57,770 --> 02:21:58,450
75613.

2837
02:21:59,090 --> 02:22:00,850
Oh, that's a little awkward.

2838
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:05,570
When did I send in the wrong twin?

2839
02:22:06,270 --> 02:22:10,890
I mean, I guess you could go out there with...

2840
02:22:10,890 --> 02:22:11,570
Um...

2841
02:22:12,850 --> 02:22:15,110
Um... I'm just sending her...

2842
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,270
Don't worry.

2843
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:18,550
She's alive.

2844
02:22:19,470 --> 02:22:20,390
Hahahaha.

2845
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:25,190
I can tell them apart.

2846
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:27,210
They'll keep promising.

2847
02:22:28,470 --> 02:22:31,130
Wait, didn't I send you up there too?

2848
02:22:33,390 --> 02:22:34,830
Oh, wait.

2849
02:22:35,390 --> 02:22:36,210
Hahahaha.

2850
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:40,610
Wait, did I also send you up there?

2851
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:44,390
Wait.

2852
02:22:46,210 --> 02:22:46,890
2668.

2853
02:22:47,470 --> 02:22:49,270
Let me call real quick.

2854
02:22:59,890 --> 02:23:00,570
Oh.

2855
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:01,470
Oh, okay.

2856
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:02,270
He's alive.

2857
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:03,250
Hahahaha.

2858
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:05,590
Okay.

2859
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:07,510
Okay, what I did...

2860
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:09,270
Oh, they're alive.

2861
02:23:09,810 --> 02:23:10,810
Oh, it's the twin.

2862
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:11,690
Oh, it's this.

2863
02:23:11,790 --> 02:23:13,010
It's the ball twins.

2864
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:14,710
Ball chin.

2865
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:15,490
Okay.

2866
02:23:15,490 --> 02:23:16,330
Get it.

2867
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:17,470
I did something right.

2868
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:24,690
Okay, thank god.

2869
02:23:24,790 --> 02:23:25,610
The testicle chin.

2870
02:23:25,950 --> 02:23:26,970
I got it.

2871
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:29,990
Hey!

2872
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:32,430
I think I did pretty well.

2873
02:23:34,170 --> 02:23:35,330
Wait a minute.

2874
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:36,510
I don't remember.

2875
02:23:36,670 --> 02:23:38,190
Did I send you up there?

2876
02:23:38,890 --> 02:23:39,570
Hahahaha.

2877
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:43,610
They're all blurring together, guys.

2878
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:45,850
I don't remember.

2879
02:23:45,850 --> 02:23:47,110
Did I...

2880
02:23:47,110 --> 02:23:48,750
Did I send you up?

2881
02:23:51,210 --> 02:23:51,850
Roman...

2882
02:23:53,090 --> 02:23:53,730
Stilinski...

2883
02:23:53,730 --> 02:23:57,790
Okay, now I'm... Guys, I'm checking my list and checking it twice now.

2884
02:23:58,310 --> 02:23:59,250
Guys, I'm...

2885
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:00,690
I'm making sure.

2886
02:24:01,190 --> 02:24:03,670
I might have messed up once, guys.

2887
02:24:03,770 --> 02:24:04,390
Just once.

2888
02:24:07,450 --> 02:24:08,090
4839405...

2889
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:09,990
Did I send you up top already?

2890
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:14,790
11521152.

2891
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:15,810
11521152.

2892
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:23,420
Okay, there's Lois.

2893
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:25,900
Okay, she's not...

2894
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:27,640
Okay, so like...

2895
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:28,640
This could be him.

2896
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:32,900
Um...

2897
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:34,200
It has to be him, right?

2898
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:36,660
Yeah, public accountant.

2899
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:38,200
You know what?

2900
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:40,640
You're...

2901
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:41,940
Let me make sure.

2902
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:45,440
You seem alright.

2903
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:47,360
You...

2904
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,920
Oh yeah, what about his hat?

2905
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,000
Oh my god.

2906
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:57,220
It's crazy tonight and he's not wearing a hat one day.

2907
02:24:57,320 --> 02:24:58,080
Who would do that?

2908
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,240
I mean, his ID doesn't have a hat.

2909
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:03,280
Like...

2910
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,360
When did he ever have a hat?

2911
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,160
I'm not...

2912
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:08,940
Alright.

2913
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:09,960
It's fine.

2914
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:11,740
Go right in.

2915
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:14,780
He's just...

2916
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:16,000
Look, he's been through a lot.

2917
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:17,300
He's a public accountant.

2918
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:19,360
Oh my god!

2919
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:19,920
Okay.

2920
02:25:25,740 --> 02:25:28,400
I mean, we do need a mom.

2921
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:33,240
Guys, we do need a mom for the child.

2922
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:35,580
Let's just call the child real quick.

2923
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:42,100
1-3-4-6 1-3-4 I don't know...

2924
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:43,920
We do...

2925
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,740
We do need a mom.

2926
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:45,780
We do need a mom.

2927
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:54,650
Oh, she's the only one in her apartment.

2928
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:55,910
I quit.

2929
02:25:59,970 --> 02:26:03,270
Look, I kept messing up the eyes so she took the eyes out.

2930
02:26:06,510 --> 02:26:08,530
Do not send the...

2931
02:26:08,530 --> 02:26:10,150
She needs a mom!

2932
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:13,850
Fine!

2933
02:26:13,850 --> 02:26:14,110
Fine!

2934
02:26:15,330 --> 02:26:18,070
You're the one that wanted to make her an orphan, not me.

2935
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:21,070
I was willing to fix the problem.

2936
02:26:21,970 --> 02:26:24,410
I was willing to fix the problem, chat.

2937
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:27,490
Wait.

2938
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:28,470
We're back.

2939
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:32,770
Oh, wait.

2940
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:39,880
Okay, okay, okay.

2941
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,080
I didn't send the wrong one.

2942
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:44,240
I didn't send...

2943
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:45,820
I didn't send...

2944
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:47,140
His name was Romar.

2945
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:49,360
Okay, I got that one right.

2946
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:50,640
That's okay, guys.

2947
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:51,700
I didn't fuck up.

2948
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:54,440
I got that one correctly.

2949
02:26:56,700 --> 02:27:00,280
How many elements are in the power set of the...

2950
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:01,320
The fuck?

2951
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:02,800
ChatGPT!

2952
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:05,280
ChatGPT.

2953
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:08,020
I need help.

2954
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,000
How many...

2955
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,220
It cannot all...

2956
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:16,600
Guys, 42 is not always the answer, chat.

2957
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:21,000
It was like...

2958
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:23,100
I don't know.

2959
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:23,940
It was like...

2960
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:26,840
It was like boobies or something.

2961
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:27,460
I don't know.

2962
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:30,600
It cannot all be 42, guys.

2963
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:32,380
Yes, it is.

2964
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:34,880
It's the answer to everything.

2965
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:46,580
Guys, I need to know how many elements are in the power set of the set of a happy palindromic numbers less than 10,000.

2966
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:47,020
Okay.

2967
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:48,920
4,180.

2968
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:51,380
I swear to...

2969
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:54,880
Okay, there's multiple people writing that, so it has to be true.

2970
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:57,300
Oh.

2971
02:27:58,700 --> 02:28:01,940
Sorry, it was one guy that spammed it three times.

2972
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,580
I'm timing you up.

2973
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:11,360
Okay, I'm giving you a time out.

2974
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:17,580
It was one guy that spammed it three times.

2975
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:21,480
I was like, oh, okay.

2976
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:23,760
I mean, that seems like a random number.

2977
02:28:24,660 --> 02:28:31,260
It was one guy that fucking posted it three times back to back.

2978
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:34,900
Actually, one guy.

2979
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:38,820
I was like, that seems like a random number.

2980
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,240
And multiple people were posting it.

2981
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:46,220
But it was not multiple people, it was red boys.

2982
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,860
Fuck, I was setting him up.

2983
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:52,100
Bro, why are you a double gang?

2984
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:53,300
You're so cool.

2985
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:55,900
Oh my god, the red boys.

2986
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:57,160
Let's fucking go.

2987
02:28:58,220 --> 02:28:59,540
Oh my god.

2988
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,320
You know he's cooler.

2989
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:02,580
You know he's cooler.

2990
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:04,300
Is he?

2991
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:09,840
It says gamer tag.

2992
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:10,820
God damn it.

2993
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:14,160
And he's the cooler red boy too.

2994
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,540
Bro is way cooler.

2995
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:21,360
Red boys, rise up.

2996
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:24,620
Red boys, xx.

2997
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:26,660
Alright.

2998
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,640
I did pretty well today.

2999
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:32,140
Oh man.

3000
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:38,100
Neighbors eliminated by a double gang.

3001
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:41,280
Wait, I got an A!

3002
02:29:41,540 --> 02:29:42,660
I passed!

3003
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:44,240
Let's go!

3004
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:48,900
Yippee!

3005
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:54,940
Oh, different eyebrows?

3006
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:56,860
What the fuck?

3007
02:29:56,860 --> 02:29:59,540
Illinois, not shit.

3008
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:03,100
Oh yeah, cause I sent the real neighbor up top too.

3009
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:05,400
It was nuts.

3010
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:13,700
Oh yeah, I killed the mom, and then I sent the real twin up so she got double eliminated.

3011
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:14,980
Whoops.

3012
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:19,900
That's my bad.

3013
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:21,280
Killed.

3014
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:22,080
Yay!

3015
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,180
Yay!

3016
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:27,840
I passed though, guys.

3017
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:28,720
I passed.

3018
02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:33,480
I got two and I still I got an A!

3019
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:36,160
Okay, clearly they were not that important.

3020
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:46,380
Oh man, I knew there was a double ganger and I still sent her up there.

3021
02:30:46,860 --> 02:30:53,060
Truly, I think I quite, guys, I think I could be Employee of the Month, guys.

3022
02:30:53,660 --> 02:30:54,840
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

3023
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:55,620
Thank you, thank you.

3024
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:57,860
When does the game get hard, bro?

3025
02:30:58,220 --> 02:30:59,540
Thank you for the super chat.

3026
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:11,060
Guys, all I'm saying is that neighbor, that means there's a free apartment room and in this economy, guys, come on, the rent is great.

3027
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:15,400
Great rent, great doorsman, by the way.

3028
02:31:15,660 --> 02:31:24,520
Like, you get to have the apartment building rent by me as the doorsman and I will keep you all safe.

3029
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:32,440
I will keep you all safe.

3030
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:35,020
How much is rent?

3031
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:36,640
Um, enough.

3032
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:38,800
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

3033
02:31:38,900 --> 02:31:39,740
Thank you, thank you.

3034
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:42,760
How are you scoring with the twins now?

3035
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:43,980
Thank you for the super chat.

3036
02:31:44,060 --> 02:31:44,960
Thank you, thank you.

3037
02:31:45,220 --> 02:31:48,740
And we have the milkman.

3038
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:50,580
Like, come on.

3039
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:53,120
What more would you want, chat?

3040
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:55,460
Will you have a doorsman job?

3041
02:31:55,540 --> 02:31:57,980
I don't think I wanna live there.

3042
02:31:58,380 --> 02:31:59,260
Thank you for the super chat.

3043
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:00,480
Thank you, thank you.

3044
02:32:01,220 --> 02:32:02,960
All I'm saying...

3045
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:05,300
I got an A, guys.

3046
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:06,740
You can't judge me.

3047
02:32:07,180 --> 02:32:08,320
I got an A!

3048
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:13,460
They said I did a great job.

3049
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,600
You're not the ones that marked my papers.

3050
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:21,000
Alright.

3051
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:25,500
I think... Do we do one more run or do we call it here, chat?

3052
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,220
What are the other...

3053
02:32:27,220 --> 02:32:28,860
Wait, actually, what are the other game modes?

3054
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:30,960
Oh, there's the clown.

3055
02:32:32,180 --> 02:32:33,900
True experience of a workman.

3056
02:32:34,900 --> 02:32:36,280
How many runs are there?

3057
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:38,340
Challenge the clown to one more?

3058
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:40,640
One more?

3059
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:41,460
Alright.

3060
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:44,200
Really needs that death confession move now after this.

3061
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:45,460
Alright, we'll do one more run.

3062
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:48,560
Thank you for the super chat.

3063
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,700
Thank you, thank you.

3064
02:32:53,850 --> 02:32:54,690
I'm average.

3065
02:32:54,770 --> 02:32:55,310
Look at that.

3066
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:57,710
Oh, wait.

3067
02:32:57,770 --> 02:32:58,610
Did I got fired?

3068
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:06,810
Wait.

3069
02:33:06,810 --> 02:33:07,830
I got...

3070
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:11,250
Wait.

3071
02:33:15,410 --> 02:33:16,030
Oh,

3072
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:20,570
I finished the way.

3073
02:33:20,850 --> 02:33:22,790
I was gonna be like...

3074
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:24,550
Wait, did I just got fired?

3075
02:33:27,850 --> 02:33:29,850
I didn't click continue.

3076
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:31,410
Oh, wait.

3077
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:31,930
I won.

3078
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:32,610
Oh, yay.

3079
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:34,070
I won these.

3080
02:33:34,070 --> 02:33:35,410
What is this?

3081
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:37,170
Nightmare mode.

3082
02:33:37,830 --> 02:33:38,650
Holy shit.

3083
02:33:39,010 --> 02:33:40,270
It has eyes.

3084
02:33:42,530 --> 02:33:43,770
Oh, shit.

3085
02:33:43,890 --> 02:33:44,790
What the fuck?

3086
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:50,030
Oh my god, right here must be really cheap.

3087
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:53,930
Wait, but who kills...

3088
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:56,030
Did they just kill...

3089
02:33:56,030 --> 02:33:56,770
What?

3090
02:34:00,130 --> 02:34:01,630
Is that springtrap?

3091
02:34:01,630 --> 02:34:02,950
Or is this...

3092
02:34:03,670 --> 02:34:04,230
Peter?

3093
02:34:07,350 --> 02:34:09,130
Oh my gosh, what the fuck?

3094
02:34:09,550 --> 02:34:11,310
You're so fucked up looking already.

3095
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:12,510
How do I know?

3096
02:34:13,150 --> 02:34:14,390
Oh my god.

3097
02:34:15,010 --> 02:34:15,890
What about milkman?

3098
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:17,110
Is that the milkman?

3099
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:18,990
What did they do to you?

3100
02:34:21,410 --> 02:34:24,410
Oh no, what did they do to you?

3101
02:34:24,970 --> 02:34:29,050
Oh my god, the milkman was a freak all along.

3102
02:34:29,050 --> 02:34:31,050
Oh no.

3103
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:35,770
The milkman was a freak.

3104
02:34:36,530 --> 02:34:38,830
Okay, floor third...

3105
02:34:38,830 --> 02:34:41,690
Wait, third floor, first floor.

3106
02:34:45,290 --> 02:34:51,370
6-3-2-5 2-5-9-8-4 Oh, he's a skin carpenter.

3107
02:34:52,130 --> 02:34:53,570
The milk freak.

3108
02:34:55,210 --> 02:34:58,530
Look, even monsters have to be worried, okay?

3109
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:00,110
Where does he live?

3110
02:35:00,230 --> 02:35:05,010
5-2-4-1 5-2- 4-1

3111
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:11,900
God, I need to get lost.

3112
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:12,920
Oh, wait.

3113
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:15,180
There's nobody home.

3114
02:35:18,100 --> 02:35:18,780
Um...

3115
02:35:19,380 --> 02:35:21,040
I mean, you look okay.

3116
02:35:21,700 --> 02:35:22,800
Can't tell.

3117
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:25,280
I mean, I...

3118
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:27,360
You all look like freaks!

3119
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:27,980
I...

3120
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:29,640
I'm sorry!

3121
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:32,220
It's really difficult!

3122
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:35,480
I like the milkman better this way.

3123
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:37,080
Okay.

3124
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:38,960
Behold my presence, human.

3125
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:39,540
Alright.

3126
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:41,440
Open your entry.

3127
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:42,920
Alright.

3128
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:45,980
Whoa.

3129
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:50,000
Wait, you're not on the list.

3130
02:35:53,470 --> 02:35:56,230
I suddenly summoned into the mortal world.

3131
02:35:56,230 --> 02:35:57,090
Oh yeah, shit.

3132
02:35:57,310 --> 02:35:58,770
Don't you hate it when that happens?

3133
02:35:58,950 --> 02:36:03,070
When those stupid humans just summon you for like some deal or some shit?

3134
02:36:03,810 --> 02:36:04,210
Yeah.

3135
02:36:05,210 --> 02:36:06,410
That's rough, buddy.

3136
02:36:07,550 --> 02:36:10,290
2-4-5-2 No, wait!

3137
02:36:10,690 --> 02:36:11,370
Wait, no, it's 4.

3138
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:12,290
Sorry, I can't...

3139
02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:13,730
Oh my god, there's too many dots.

3140
02:36:14,410 --> 02:36:17,290
Oh, this is nightmare mode.

3141
02:36:17,390 --> 02:36:18,370
Oh my god.

3142
02:36:18,730 --> 02:36:19,710
I don't know.

3143
02:36:23,930 --> 02:36:25,390
Oh my god.

3144
02:36:25,710 --> 02:36:26,010
Oh my god.

3145
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:28,970
Yeah, sounds like an appropriate emergency.

3146
02:36:29,950 --> 02:36:31,350
Ex-lanithro.

3147
02:36:31,770 --> 02:36:32,270
Okay.

3148
02:36:34,670 --> 02:36:38,710
2-5-3 2-5-9-6-8 Alright, everything looks good.

3149
02:36:38,870 --> 02:36:39,830
Yeah, he has sharp teeth.

3150
02:36:39,930 --> 02:36:40,150
Look.

3151
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:42,490
Oh, look at that.

3152
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:43,450
The teeth are sharp.

3153
02:36:45,770 --> 02:36:46,330
Alright.

3154
02:36:46,710 --> 02:36:47,850
Everything looks good, buddy.

3155
02:36:47,850 --> 02:36:49,770
Go straight in.

3156
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:51,750
Oh, shit.

3157
02:36:51,790 --> 02:36:53,430
I forgot to call.

3158
02:36:58,030 --> 02:36:59,450
Okay, let's...

3159
02:36:59,450 --> 02:37:02,930
8-6-6-2 Let's see if they're alive.

3160
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:14,260
Oh, okay.

3161
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:16,280
Guys, he picked up.

3162
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:18,580
Look at that.

3163
02:37:19,860 --> 02:37:21,200
Look at that, guys.

3164
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:23,160
Guys, he picked up.

3165
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:24,160
We're safe.

3166
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,100
We're safe.

3167
02:37:25,500 --> 02:37:26,940
Okay, we're okay.

3168
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:28,160
Oh, is this the...

3169
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,800
Oh, shit.

3170
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:31,020
That's the...guys.

3171
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:32,820
Wait, that's the other twin.

3172
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:34,940
That's one of the twins.

3173
02:37:40,750 --> 02:37:41,270
Uh...

3174
02:37:43,390 --> 02:37:47,690
Yangluowangdu 3-1 No, that's not the twin.

3175
02:37:47,810 --> 02:37:48,630
That's a different person.

3176
02:37:48,810 --> 02:37:50,130
Oh, that's someone's wife.

3177
02:37:51,990 --> 02:37:54,230
How the fuck did this guy escort her?

3178
02:37:57,850 --> 02:37:58,510
Damn.

3179
02:37:58,750 --> 02:38:00,070
He must have a...

3180
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:01,450
He must be really funny.

3181
02:38:05,070 --> 02:38:06,390
7-9...

3182
02:38:06,390 --> 02:38:06,830
Oh.

3183
02:38:10,150 --> 02:38:11,850
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

3184
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:13,270
I know you're...

3185
02:38:13,270 --> 02:38:14,710
I'm sorry.

3186
02:38:15,930 --> 02:38:18,330
I already knew humans were foolish.

3187
02:38:18,930 --> 02:38:19,590
Um...

3188
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:22,470
I'm sorry, ma'am, but like...

3189
02:38:22,470 --> 02:38:23,490
I'm sorry.

3190
02:38:23,490 --> 02:38:24,810
You're...

3191
02:38:25,470 --> 02:38:26,350
You are...

3192
02:38:26,350 --> 02:38:28,710
You're hot, but I'm sorry.

3193
02:38:33,390 --> 02:38:34,670
I'm sorry.

3194
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:38,390
Your ID was just not good enough, ma'am.

3195
02:38:38,490 --> 02:38:39,210
I'm sorry.

3196
02:38:39,470 --> 02:38:40,770
Please don't hurt me.

3197
02:38:42,270 --> 02:38:43,630
No, she was...

3198
02:38:43,630 --> 02:38:44,050
Oh, hey.

3199
02:38:44,290 --> 02:38:44,930
She's back.

3200
02:38:45,950 --> 02:38:47,450
She's fucking back.

3201
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:47,930
Okay.

3202
02:38:48,430 --> 02:38:49,450
7-9...

3203
02:38:49,450 --> 02:38:49,750
Okay.

3204
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:49,830
Okay.

3205
02:38:50,150 --> 02:38:51,810
It's the same one.

3206
02:38:52,930 --> 02:38:53,690
Okay.

3207
02:38:54,090 --> 02:38:56,650
She came back and brought a different ID.

3208
02:38:57,390 --> 02:38:58,270
Sorry, ma'am.

3209
02:38:58,370 --> 02:39:00,250
It's still not the right ID.

3210
02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:00,970
I'm sorry.

3211
02:39:02,750 --> 02:39:04,270
It's still...

3212
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:10,010
It's not the right ID, ma'am.

3213
02:39:11,130 --> 02:39:12,750
Ain't no way.

3214
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:17,690
She escaped death.

3215
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:20,790
Alright, who's next?

3216
02:39:21,390 --> 02:39:22,130
Oh, okay.

3217
02:39:22,690 --> 02:39:23,490
Okay.

3218
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:24,910
Let me...

3219
02:39:24,910 --> 02:39:26,470
Alright, round 3.

3220
02:39:27,570 --> 02:39:31,830
7-9-8-6-5-4-2...

3221
02:39:32,390 --> 02:39:32,690
Okay.

3222
02:39:32,810 --> 02:39:35,830
She brought the right ID this time.

3223
02:39:36,150 --> 02:39:37,210
We did it, guys.

3224
02:39:37,370 --> 02:39:39,210
She brought the right one.

3225
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:40,290
Alright.

3226
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:42,510
This all looks appropriate.

3227
02:39:43,870 --> 02:39:46,390
Let me double check your...

3228
02:39:46,390 --> 02:39:48,370
Your appearance real quick.

3229
02:39:48,370 --> 02:39:49,010
Okay.

3230
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:50,910
Can you talk real fast?

3231
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:53,810
Seems they don't work well.

3232
02:39:54,210 --> 02:39:56,070
Can't see my ID is purple.

3233
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:59,310
Woah, don't fucking give me a good time, ma'am.

3234
02:40:00,930 --> 02:40:02,210
Just got...

3235
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:04,870
Got her identity stolen.

3236
02:40:05,950 --> 02:40:06,330
Alright.

3237
02:40:06,670 --> 02:40:08,070
5-2-4-1.

3238
02:40:08,890 --> 02:40:09,530
5...

3239
02:40:09,530 --> 02:40:12,350
2-4-1.

3240
02:40:20,050 --> 02:40:20,370
Alright.

3241
02:40:20,590 --> 02:40:21,450
Okay, there's the husband.

3242
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:23,510
Okay.

3243
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:28,470
Oh yeah, they did forget their entry request.

3244
02:40:28,610 --> 02:40:28,830
Okay.

3245
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:30,870
Yeah, right?

3246
02:40:33,570 --> 02:40:34,250
Wait.

3247
02:40:36,810 --> 02:40:37,390
Wait.

3248
02:40:39,350 --> 02:40:40,990
They forgot their entry at home.

3249
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:42,050
Wait a minute.

3250
02:40:42,690 --> 02:40:42,970
Wait.

3251
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:45,610
Bro!

3252
02:40:47,210 --> 02:40:48,870
Wait a minute.

3253
02:40:50,690 --> 02:40:51,370
Again?

3254
02:40:52,250 --> 02:40:54,510
Ma'am, you gotta stop trying.

3255
02:40:57,110 --> 02:40:59,130
Ma'am, please.

3256
02:41:01,550 --> 02:41:04,270
She got the correct ID.

3257
02:41:05,770 --> 02:41:09,070
At least she got the right ID this time.

3258
02:41:09,370 --> 02:41:10,530
The fourth time.

3259
02:41:10,830 --> 02:41:11,450
I swear to God.

3260
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:13,290
She comes in and it's her again.

3261
02:41:13,390 --> 02:41:14,530
I swear to God.

3262
02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:22,250
What?

3263
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:25,290
The fourth...

3264
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:28,690
The fourth time's the charm.

3265
02:41:29,310 --> 02:41:30,690
Okay, here's her ID.

3266
02:41:31,330 --> 02:41:33,510
Okay, there she forgot her entry.

3267
02:41:33,790 --> 02:41:34,590
It's a cycle.

3268
02:41:34,790 --> 02:41:36,130
It never ends.

3269
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:36,970
Alright.

3270
02:41:37,550 --> 02:41:39,470
We got her ID.

3271
02:41:39,950 --> 02:41:41,030
Yet again.

3272
02:41:41,750 --> 02:41:46,650
9-7-9-8-6-5-4-2-9-8.

3273
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:47,590
Okay.

3274
02:41:48,650 --> 02:41:49,450
Everything...

3275
02:41:49,450 --> 02:41:50,710
Alright, let's see.

3276
02:41:51,850 --> 02:41:55,850
Everything seems to look correct this time.

3277
02:41:57,510 --> 02:41:59,830
This has never...

3278
02:41:59,830 --> 02:42:00,310
Okay.

3279
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:03,250
Yeah, alright.

3280
02:42:03,370 --> 02:42:05,930
Everything looks like it's correct.

3281
02:42:06,130 --> 02:42:08,230
We did not fuck it up.

3282
02:42:08,570 --> 02:42:13,970
5-2-4-1-5-2- 4 -1.

3283
02:42:22,890 --> 02:42:23,490
Alright.

3284
02:42:23,810 --> 02:42:24,910
Did she come back yet?

3285
02:42:25,070 --> 02:42:26,190
Alright, she didn't.

3286
02:42:27,010 --> 02:42:28,530
Alright, they did forget it.

3287
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:29,510
Okay, alright.

3288
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:31,830
I think you're the right one.

3289
02:42:35,330 --> 02:42:37,810
I'm pretty sure you're the right one.

3290
02:42:40,050 --> 02:42:42,090
Okay, let me double check.

3291
02:42:42,710 --> 02:42:43,830
Yep, shark teeth.

3292
02:42:47,830 --> 02:42:48,590
Alright, yep.

3293
02:42:49,850 --> 02:42:52,330
Perhaps you're more or less simply cannot...

3294
02:42:52,330 --> 02:42:53,970
I don't know, I've just seen you too many times.

3295
02:42:54,070 --> 02:42:55,330
I had to make sure.

3296
02:42:55,430 --> 02:42:58,170
Alright, come right in.

3297
02:42:58,290 --> 02:43:00,190
We got the right one, guys.

3298
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:03,550
We got the right one.

3299
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:06,250
It only took four tries.

3300
02:43:07,630 --> 02:43:08,710
Oh, shit.

3301
02:43:09,050 --> 02:43:09,630
Okay, hey.

3302
02:43:10,090 --> 02:43:11,150
Oh my god.

3303
02:43:11,490 --> 02:43:11,890
Hey, kinky.

3304
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:12,810
You're a milkman.

3305
02:43:15,330 --> 02:43:15,890
Alright.

3306
02:43:15,890 --> 02:43:16,110
Alright.

3307
02:43:18,030 --> 02:43:19,110
Abuseous morale.

3308
02:43:20,330 --> 02:43:21,610
Where does he live again?

3309
02:43:21,710 --> 02:43:22,770
I don't remember.

3310
02:43:23,390 --> 02:43:24,710
It's the first floor, right?

3311
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:27,350
763...

3312
02:43:28,750 --> 02:43:29,390
76478...

3313
02:43:29,390 --> 02:43:30,110
Mutilator.

3314
02:43:33,390 --> 02:43:34,030
3155...

3315
02:43:34,030 --> 02:43:34,610
3...

3316
02:43:37,010 --> 02:43:37,650
155...

3317
02:43:37,650 --> 02:43:38,510
Just to make sure.

3318
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:44,490
Is nightmare mode endless?

3319
02:43:44,670 --> 02:43:47,190
Or is it like per round?

3320
02:43:47,450 --> 02:43:48,650
Just like the first one.

3321
02:43:48,790 --> 02:43:49,910
Okay, he's not home.

3322
02:43:50,470 --> 02:43:51,950
I mean, you look correct.

3323
02:43:53,850 --> 02:43:55,250
You have two pierced.

3324
02:43:55,350 --> 02:43:57,250
Oh, you have more than two.

3325
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:02,030
He's breathing very heavily, too.

3326
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,710
Yeah.

3327
02:44:09,350 --> 02:44:12,870
I'm a little uncomfortable with how heavy he's breathing, but yeah.

3328
02:44:12,870 --> 02:44:14,110
Yeah, he seems very excited.

3329
02:44:14,490 --> 02:44:15,290
That's for sure.

3330
02:44:15,670 --> 02:44:17,690
Yes, no, yes.

3331
02:44:19,330 --> 02:44:19,970
Yes.

3332
02:44:20,970 --> 02:44:21,850
Right here.

3333
02:44:23,210 --> 02:44:25,430
He's breathing very heavily right now.

3334
02:44:25,630 --> 02:44:27,970
He's getting a little too antsy.

3335
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:33,120
Alright.

3336
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:34,460
Goodbye, milkman.

3337
02:44:38,550 --> 02:44:39,190
Oh.

3338
02:44:41,090 --> 02:44:41,730
Barbados.

3339
02:44:43,310 --> 02:44:43,590
Alright.

3340
02:44:43,870 --> 02:44:45,030
How would it mean?

3341
02:44:45,090 --> 02:44:47,330
I guess nightmare would just be like the horns, too?

3342
02:44:48,070 --> 02:44:50,070
I mean, all the horns look like it's correct.

3343
02:44:50,350 --> 02:44:52,170
And then the...

3344
02:44:52,170 --> 02:44:53,350
Oh, greetings.

3345
02:44:53,530 --> 02:44:54,130
Hey, that's me.

3346
02:44:54,190 --> 02:44:54,650
I'm mortal.

3347
02:44:55,630 --> 02:44:56,430
Wait, I'm immortal?

3348
02:44:56,930 --> 02:44:58,150
I'm immortal here?

3349
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:00,890
Okay.

3350
02:45:02,390 --> 02:45:02,910
Damn.

3351
02:45:04,510 --> 02:45:06,210
Job market is fucking rough.

3352
02:45:08,790 --> 02:45:11,750
Job market is so fucking rough, man.

3353
02:45:13,250 --> 02:45:13,770
Barabam.

3354
02:45:13,770 --> 02:45:15,130
Human hunter?

3355
02:45:15,990 --> 02:45:16,990
Oh, shit.

3356
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:18,090
Wait, I'm human.

3357
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:19,650
Wait.

3358
02:45:20,610 --> 02:45:24,410
I couldn't get a real job back in the human world?

3359
02:45:25,370 --> 02:45:26,090
8662?

3360
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:34,580
I got him, right?

3361
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:36,620
Okay, is your dad home?

3362
02:45:38,220 --> 02:45:38,640
Okay.

3363
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:41,040
Alright, yeah, alright.

3364
02:45:41,180 --> 02:45:41,760
That's fine.

3365
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:43,800
Everything looks great.

3366
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:44,760
Barbados.

3367
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:47,380
Uh...

3368
02:45:47,380 --> 02:45:48,740
Triple D, triple D.

3369
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:50,620
Yeah, come right in.

3370
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:53,360
You don't have your ID, but everything else looks good.

3371
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:57,990
I did it.

3372
02:46:01,270 --> 02:46:02,950
Did I do my job correctly?

3373
02:46:03,510 --> 02:46:05,070
Okay, elephant man.

3374
02:46:06,130 --> 02:46:06,750
Chognar.

3375
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:08,070
Okay.

3376
02:46:10,470 --> 02:46:13,170
He has two piercings, four...

3377
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:15,170
Uh...

3378
02:46:15,930 --> 02:46:17,170
Four there.

3379
02:46:17,810 --> 02:46:19,290
I mean, you look correct.

3380
02:46:19,290 --> 02:46:20,570
Do you have anything?

3381
02:46:21,330 --> 02:46:21,770
For me?

3382
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:24,430
Oh, he doesn't.

3383
02:46:24,490 --> 02:46:25,790
Okay, all I have is the ID.

3384
02:46:26,510 --> 02:46:28,130
Okay, where did you live?

3385
02:46:30,890 --> 02:46:32,670
The fuck do you live?

3386
02:46:33,970 --> 02:46:34,810
My god.

3387
02:46:35,410 --> 02:46:37,250
Oh, there he is.

3388
02:46:38,910 --> 02:46:39,430

3389
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:40,350
Fine.

3390
02:46:40,550 --> 02:46:43,230

02:46:43,230 --> 02:46:45,570
Oh, so he... Okay, big...

3395
02:46:50,050 --> 02:46:52,070

02:47:03,890 --> 02:47:05,730
Three, two, one, five.

3399
02:47:06,250 --> 02:47:09,010
I love it when my doorman tells me he doesn't know.

3400
02:47:09,610 --> 02:47:11,250
Call Justin Case.

3401
02:47:15,930 --> 02:47:17,050
Call Justin Case.

3402
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:17,270
Okay.

3403
02:47:18,790 --> 02:47:21,990
Alright, he's not... Yes, they forgot their entry request.

3404
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:22,390
Okay.

3405
02:47:22,930 --> 02:47:24,010
Yeah, that seems right.

3406
02:47:24,290 --> 02:47:25,870
You forgot your entry request too.

3407
02:47:27,550 --> 02:47:29,090
Alright, come right in.

3408
02:47:35,050 --> 02:47:35,610
Alright.

3409
02:47:36,450 --> 02:47:37,910
I should be doing a great job.

3410
02:47:38,570 --> 02:47:38,750
Oh.

3411
02:47:38,750 --> 02:47:39,630
Oh.

3412
02:47:47,290 --> 02:47:49,310
Wait, this is bad.

3413
02:47:52,150 --> 02:47:54,690
Oh, wait.

3414
02:47:57,710 --> 02:47:58,550

3415
02:47:58,550 --> 02:48:01,870
Six, three, two...

Oh, you're right!

3419
02:48:06,450 --> 02:48:06,770
It expired!

3420
02:48:10,970 --> 02:48:12,150
Wait, what?

3421
02:48:12,150 --> 02:48:14,290
Is he gaslighting me?

3422
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:18,810
It's like, I could rip your eyes out.

3423
02:48:18,870 --> 02:48:19,950
My ID is...

3424
02:48:19,950 --> 02:48:22,510
Wait, he's gaslighting me.

3425
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:24,470
Wait a minute.

3426
02:48:25,070 --> 02:48:26,170
That's it.

3427
02:48:26,510 --> 02:48:28,270
No gaslighters allowed.

3428
02:48:28,890 --> 02:48:31,110
I was like, it's perfect?

3429
02:48:31,790 --> 02:48:33,050
Am I wrong?

3430
02:48:36,410 --> 02:48:37,830
He can gaslight?

3431
02:48:39,630 --> 02:48:42,650
In this monster filled apartment building?

3432
02:48:45,330 --> 02:48:46,930
Behold my presence, human.

3433
02:48:47,050 --> 02:48:49,130
Wait, you're not on the list.

3434
02:48:50,810 --> 02:48:51,450
Oh, man.

3435
02:48:51,550 --> 02:48:53,190
I hate it when that happens too, sir.

3436
02:48:54,990 --> 02:48:56,450
I understand, man.

3437
02:48:57,450 --> 02:49:01,490
I mean, I would like it if they summoned me back to the human world.

3438
02:49:01,750 --> 02:49:02,830
That would be pretty awesome.

3439
02:49:03,630 --> 02:49:05,250
You know, I've been stuck here for a while.

3440
02:49:06,490 --> 02:49:07,450
Soul devourer.

3441
02:49:08,470 --> 02:49:11,250
Three, three, two, five, six, nine, nine, four, five.

3442
02:49:12,450 --> 02:49:15,130
In 1970 at Triple D's.

3443
02:49:15,810 --> 02:49:18,570
I come from my job as a soul devourer.

3444
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:22,530
Imagine your job is the fucking soul devourer.

3445
02:49:22,690 --> 02:49:25,770
Sir Beth and Sir... Oh, wait, name's wrong.

3446
02:49:26,210 --> 02:49:31,690
It's Sir Zez Beth and Zez Beth.

3447
02:49:31,970 --> 02:49:32,250
Okay.

3448
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:40,390
Oh my god, I'm getting gaslit by these monsters and I almost believe them.

3449
02:49:42,290 --> 02:49:43,590
Get out of here.

3450
02:49:45,390 --> 02:49:49,270
I wonder how much it pays to be a soul devourer.

3451
02:49:50,150 --> 02:49:51,410
I wonder if it has a good 401.

3452
02:49:59,160 --> 02:49:59,900
What do you mean?

3453
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:01,680
It literally said Sir Beth.

3454
02:50:02,680 --> 02:50:03,280
Yay!

3455
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:04,460
I did it!

3456
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:06,300
That one was easy.

3457
02:50:06,580 --> 02:50:07,640
Nightmare completed.

3458
02:50:08,180 --> 02:50:11,280
Wait, I got like perfect.

3459
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:12,640
Let's go.

3460
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:16,100
Nightmare completed.

3461
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:17,100
Let's fucking go.

3462
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:18,880
I'm fucking insane at this game.

3463
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:21,040
Wait, that was fun.

3464
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:22,860
Oh my god, I enjoyed it.

3465
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:24,240
Perfect score.

3466
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,060
I mean, I can do another clown.

3467
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:27,020
Wait, what's this?

3468
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:27,960
Do a clown.

3469
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:30,200
Let's play a game.

3470
02:50:30,580 --> 02:50:31,040
You know what?

3471
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:32,000
I know how to play.

3472
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:33,700
Let's beat the clown before we call it.

3473
02:50:34,380 --> 02:50:34,760
J.

3474
02:50:35,320 --> 02:50:36,200
J diamond.

3475
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:36,480
J diamond.

3476
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:38,740
Let's go low.

3477
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:40,600
We go low first.

3478
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:41,660
Four.

3479
02:50:42,660 --> 02:50:43,620
Three.

3480
02:50:45,160 --> 02:50:46,160
Five.

3481
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:47,800
Five.

3482
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,160
Wait, he's going really fast.

3483
02:50:56,630 --> 02:50:57,190
No.

3484
02:50:58,470 --> 02:51:00,070
No, don't have it.

3485
02:51:00,670 --> 02:51:01,610
Yay!

3486
02:51:08,550 --> 02:51:09,870
Wait, can I do anything?

3487
02:51:10,090 --> 02:51:10,950
Oh, I can do five.

3488
02:51:12,370 --> 02:51:12,850
Nine.

3489
02:51:13,070 --> 02:51:13,310
J.

3490
02:51:13,510 --> 02:51:13,930
Bam!

3491
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:14,690
I win.

3492
02:51:17,530 --> 02:51:19,570
I'm so good at card games, guys.

3493
02:51:20,070 --> 02:51:23,390
This is like what I do during my downtime as a doorman.

3494
02:51:23,790 --> 02:51:27,730
I just fall asleep and play cards with an evil clown.

3495
02:51:29,410 --> 02:51:30,470
Sounds about right.

3496
02:51:33,470 --> 02:51:34,670
I just...

3497
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:39,510
I go to sleep and I just play cards with an evil clown.

3498
02:51:41,210 --> 02:51:42,830
Wait, I think he might win this.

3499
02:51:43,990 --> 02:51:44,930
JK, I'm better.

3500
02:51:51,030 --> 02:51:51,630
What?!

3501
02:51:51,630 --> 02:51:52,890
No way!

3502
02:51:56,720 --> 02:51:58,240
Okay, I'm gonna keep this.

3503
02:51:59,860 --> 02:52:01,860
Okay, we start low.

3504
02:52:03,440 --> 02:52:05,040
You fucker!

3505
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:07,040
You actual fucker!

3506
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:13,760
We'll start low.

3507
02:52:16,100 --> 02:52:17,300
How does he

3508
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:25,600
have a plus one?!

3509
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:31,360
Wait, that's actually cheating!

3510
02:52:34,220 --> 02:52:36,800
Okay, I have to make him get put one.

3511
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:43,060
There's no way.

3512
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:45,600
Oh, thank god.

3513
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:47,520
Oh, thank god.

3514
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:54,530
Are you serious?!

3515
02:52:54,530 --> 02:52:57,610
Are you serious?!

3516
02:52:57,610 --> 02:53:00,250
There's no way!

3517
02:53:12,330 --> 02:53:13,550
Oh, okay.

3518
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:15,270
Okay, we're fucking each other over.

3519
02:53:19,470 --> 02:53:23,550
Are you serious?!

3520
02:53:25,210 --> 02:53:26,470
No way!

3521
02:53:28,450 --> 02:53:30,230
There's no way!

3522
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:46,260
Oh my god.

3523
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:47,460
Oh, no.

3524
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:48,600
No.

3525
02:53:50,600 --> 02:53:52,000
No!

3526
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:53,560
Please!

3527
02:53:56,260 --> 02:53:56,980
No!

3528
02:53:58,700 --> 02:53:59,520
No!

3529
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:04,320
I'm lost!

3530
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:06,340
No!

3531
02:54:08,100 --> 02:54:10,680
I got clowned!

3532
02:54:12,400 --> 02:54:14,480
Bad dream!

3533
02:54:14,480 --> 02:54:16,480
Bad dream!

3534
02:54:18,350 --> 02:54:21,900
Oh, I'm so good at Dota.

3535
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:24,380
That's not fair!

3536
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:25,840
He got me!

3537
02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:28,540
He actually got me!

3538
02:54:29,880 --> 02:54:31,760
I can't believe it!

3539
02:54:32,240 --> 02:54:35,100
I worked so hard as a Dwarven!

3540
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:40,060
And the clown had to beat me up at my game!

3541
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:41,460
That's not fair!

3542
02:54:41,460 --> 02:54:41,500
That's not fair!

3543
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:44,480
That's not fair!

3544
02:54:47,320 --> 02:54:48,720
Ended on a loss.

3545
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:53,220
I lost my firstborn child to the clown.

3546
02:54:57,260 --> 02:54:58,740
Anyway, that's fun though.

3547
02:54:58,860 --> 02:55:00,100
It's nice seeing, checking out.

3548
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:01,220
That's not Night Neighbour.

3549
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:04,920
I thought it would be a little more harder.

3550
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:11,640
Because people were saying it's like Papers, Please, but it definitely was an easier version of Papers, Please.

3551
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:14,820
I don't understand why it has a cult...

3552
02:55:14,820 --> 02:55:21,060
But wait, I don't understand though why the Milkman has a cult following.

3553
02:55:24,430 --> 02:55:28,640
I don't understand how the Milkman has a cult following.

3554
02:55:28,820 --> 02:55:30,980
That's the one thing I don't understand.

3555
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:33,040
Look at him!

3556
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:34,240
He's the Milkman!

3557
02:55:34,780 --> 02:55:35,940
Guys, you don't...

3558
02:55:35,940 --> 02:55:36,940
No, Doki.

3559
02:55:37,300 --> 02:55:38,640
You don't understand.

3560
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:44,740
But I had a great time checking it out.

3561
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,400
Alright, but before I go...

3562
02:55:48,660 --> 02:55:50,620
Before I go, it's time to show!

3563
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:51,600
Yes!

3564
02:55:52,020 --> 02:55:52,860
Buy my merch!

3565
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:57,780
So as you can see, we do have our Good Smile plushies.

3566
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:01,880
The pre-orders are closed, but we still have pre-orders going for the...

3567
02:56:01,880 --> 02:56:02,320
Oh wait, no.

3568
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:03,040
Not this one.

3569
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:03,860
Sorry, I put...

3570
02:56:04,780 --> 02:56:06,760
There's no giveaways over, by the way.

3571
02:56:06,940 --> 02:56:08,160
Sorry, this...

3572
02:56:10,300 --> 02:56:15,980
Giveaways has been over, but we still have official YouTube plushies out.

3573
02:56:17,020 --> 02:56:19,600
I'll post a link in chat real quick.

3574
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:31,060
But yeah, I think we have three weeks left for the pre-orders, so please check them out if you wish to support me and my stream and also for future merch opportunities.

3575
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:33,580
I really do appreciate it.

3576
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:34,720
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

3577
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:35,640
Thank you, thank you.

3578
02:56:35,960 --> 02:56:38,760
Sim for the tired minimum wage man.

3579
02:56:39,140 --> 02:56:39,820
Thank you for the super chat.

3580
02:56:39,900 --> 02:56:40,680
Thank you, thank you.

3581
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:44,400
Also, I know there is a birthday super chat as you all know that.

3582
02:56:44,580 --> 02:56:45,180
I know that.

3583
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:46,060
Thank you for the super chat.

3584
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:46,860
Thank you, thank you.

3585
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:51,940
Hi Doki, it's my birthday and I just want to send a small super to thank you for your streams.

3586
02:56:52,260 --> 02:56:56,680
From my evolution from a dragoon into a bird, I shall return to lurking, enjoying every moment.

3587
02:56:56,820 --> 02:56:58,480
Thank you for the super chat!

3588
02:56:58,600 --> 02:56:59,540
Thank you, thank you!

3589
02:56:59,740 --> 02:57:01,240
And a happy birthday to you!

3590
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:02,980
Happy birthday to you!

3591
02:57:03,180 --> 02:57:04,760
Happy birthday to you!

3592
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:06,920
Happy birthday, dear Xenona!

3593
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:08,940
Happy birthday to you!

3594
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:09,360
Yeah!

3595
02:57:09,620 --> 02:57:10,320
Happy birthday!

3596
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:12,980
Okay, so, oh yeah.

3597
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:15,480
Um...

3598
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:17,120
Uh...

3599
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:19,160
What was I gonna say?

3600
02:57:19,220 --> 02:57:22,160
Oh yes, and tomorrow I will be doing errands again.

3601
02:57:22,480 --> 02:57:26,520
So, I will make sure I'll buy another desktop confessional tomorrow, guys.

3602
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:26,980
I promise.

3603
02:57:26,980 --> 02:57:31,120
And then we'll check it out live on stream tomorrow if it works.

3604
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:32,540
If what?

3605
02:57:32,780 --> 02:57:33,740
I'll buy two!

3606
02:57:35,260 --> 02:57:45,740
I'll buy two and then maybe in the future I'll sign the ones that don't work and then I don't know, do a giveaway or some shit.

3607
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:49,360
What the fuck am I gonna do with three broken ones?

3608
02:57:50,740 --> 02:57:59,180
I'll buy two and then I'll sign the one that doesn't work and you can't do a giveaway or charity auction.

3609
02:58:01,320 --> 02:58:04,700
I'm gonna do two pulls!

3610
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:11,180
I'll do a two pull.

3611
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:14,600
I'm not gonna buy ten confessionals!

3612
02:58:15,060 --> 02:58:19,060
What am I gonna do with ten desktop confessionals?

3613
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:23,080
The light works, guys.

3614
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:24,280
No, it's not that.

3615
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:26,820
There's just no holy voice, okay?

3616
02:58:27,140 --> 02:58:29,340
The lights work, though, at least.

3617
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:33,040
At least the lights work.

3618
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:36,280
Anyway, guys, I'm gonna call it here.

3619
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:39,500
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3620
02:58:39,820 --> 02:58:40,460
Posture check.

3621
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:42,820
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3622
02:58:42,980 --> 02:58:46,960
And if you stay up for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

3623
02:58:47,180 --> 02:58:48,760
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3624
02:58:48,920 --> 02:58:49,800
Oh, the AmiAmi one?

3625
02:58:50,020 --> 02:58:51,720
Oh, you still wanna get the Good Smile plushies?

3626
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:53,180
AmiAmi still has pre-orders up.

3627
02:58:53,420 --> 02:58:53,620
Yeah!

3628
02:58:53,780 --> 02:58:54,500
Oh, I didn't know that!

3629
02:58:54,620 --> 02:58:54,840
Beeps!

3630
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:55,900
Thank you for the super chat!

3631
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:56,480
Thank you, thank you.

3632
02:58:56,520 --> 02:59:02,060
But yes, if you still want the Good Smile plushie, the AmiAmi one's still pre-ordered over there.

3633
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:03,820
Anyway, guys, I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3634
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:05,060
Bye, guys!

3635
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:05,660
Bye!

3636
02:59:18,270 --> 02:59:19,410
Also, secret... Oh, sorry.

3637
02:59:19,610 --> 02:59:21,090
Wrong chat thingy.

3638
02:59:21,330 --> 02:59:22,230
But secret ending!

3639
02:59:23,150 --> 02:59:23,870
Secret ending!

3640
02:59:24,110 --> 02:59:33,610
You can tell my voice is getting better and better slowly, so I hope by next week, I'll be able to I'll be able to do longer Zatsudon's after streams again.

3641
02:59:34,450 --> 02:59:44,450
Obviously, I can't do long chatting streams after stream because of my voice recovering and my throat recovering, but I hope that maybe by next week, I can start doing again.

3642
02:59:44,550 --> 02:59:45,790
Anyway, guys, I'll see you guys next time.

3643
02:59:45,830 --> 02:59:46,130
Bye!
