1
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,570
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,810
Sorry, sorry for being a little late today.

3
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,690
Um, I actually woke up late.

4
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:00,730
Oh my gosh, I was supposed to take a nap last night because I had so much preparations to do, uh, for the server and everything and the announcement and stuff like that.

5
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,990
And then I woke up at, um, 11.30 a.m.

6
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,150
Yippee.

7
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,790
Oh, today's not a good day for me because I, I slept wrong too.

8
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,510
So my back is...

9
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,090
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,810
I took some pain, I took some Tylenol, uh, before the stream.

11
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,350
So I hope it kicks in soon.

12
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,130
Um, but I did not.

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,450
I had good sleep.

14
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,430
I woke up.

15
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,410
I woke up and it was like, back hurt.

16
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,290
So, um, and then, you know, I had to take care of dad.

17
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,790
Uh, he's on very strict bed rest, uh, for the next four weeks.

18
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,030
So, uh, to, like, give him his medication and everything.

19
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,930
Uh, I also have to, like, pick him up.

20
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,750
Like, he could walk, but, like, I just don't want to, like, like, you know, um, risk it.

21
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,850
You know, I don't want him to move too much because the doctors were like, oh, make sure he doesn't move too much.

22
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,890
He could, he could still, like, walk to the, to the, to the first walkies as long as it's a very short walkies.

23
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,910
But, um, you know, I want to make sure he's as comfortable as possible.

24
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:12,850
So, I have to even, like, carry him, I have to carry him to the dog park, put him down, let him pee and poop, and then carry him back, back home and everything.

25
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,050
So, yeah, uh, just, oh my gosh.

26
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,550
And then when I got back, my, my staff, he was like, you gotta do this, you gotta tweet this, you gotta do this, you gotta do, and I was like, remember the dude, I was like, ah!

27
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,730
And the thing is, I also didn't install the shaders and stuff like that.

28
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,950
The shaders and everything for the Minecraft stuff.

29
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,050
So, like, I was, like, trying to figure out how to install shaders.

30
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,270
Like, install the iris and sodium shaders again for my Minecraft thing.

31
00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:04,450
So, like, the thing is, I was so confused because it was, like, it was, like, because I use iris and sodium for my Minecraft, like, modding stuff for shaders and resource packs.

32
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:17,330
So, and I always have to read the instructions again on how to do it because I have to upgrade it for the, I have to, like, update it for the, you know, 1.2, 1.7 update.

33
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:24,350
And then, so, I was, like, freaking out because I was, like, why does it say 2.1.8 and 2.1.5?

34
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,850
Where's 2.1.7?

35
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,230
I was so confused.

36
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,330
And I was, like, what happened to it?

37
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,090
So, I was, like, watching YouTube videos and everything and going on Reddit and stuff like that.

38
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,350
Because, like, and you're, like, oh, yeah, it does say 2.1.8, but 2.1.8 encompasses 2.1.7, too.

39
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,850
It includes 2.1.7.

40
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,950
And I'm, like, then I was, like, so confused.

41
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,830
Why doesn't that say that on the installation package?

42
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,250
Why did it jump from 2.1.5 to 2.1.8?

43
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,110
Like, that's...

44
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,250
Oh!

45
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,270
And, um, I was so...

46
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:05,730
I was so confused because I spent, um, I spent, like, uh, but then, like, the other...

47
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,950
Like, it was, like, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.1.6...

48
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,150
Like, it was, like, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.1.6.

49
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,310
And there wasn't even 2.1.6 and it was, like, 2.1.8.

50
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,630
And I was, like, what happened to 7?

51
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:18,670
I...

52
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,430
I was just, like...

53
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,090
What happened...

54
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,290
What happened to 7?

55
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,090
I was...

56
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,010
So, I had to, like...

57
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,710
I was, like, reading...

58
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,150
I had to, like, watch a YouTube video.

59
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,710
I was, like, what is this guy has 2.1.7 on his installation package?

60
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,950
Where's mine?

61
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,790
So apparently they deleted 7 and then like just put... and then just went for 21.8 and it's like, oh, don't worry, it works with 21.7.

62
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,970
But it doesn't say that.

63
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,270
It doesn't say that on like the instructions.

64
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,410
So... I have to find that info on fucking Reddit.

65
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,870
And so anyway, so that's why I'm a little bit late.

66
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,050
Uh... That's why I'm a bit late.

67
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,550
Because I was trying to figure this shit out.

68
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,170
Because I was like, I'm not playing on vanilla.

69
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:03,650
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,150
I'm not playing on vanilla like Minecraft.

71
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,090
I... I... I can't.

72
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,790
Like every... You know, like when you... when you use resource packs and then you go back and then like, you know, your eyes start bleeding.

73
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,410
Like... I was like, ah!

74
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,070
I was like, ah!

75
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,290
And so I had to... My eyes!

76
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,930
So I had to like... It's just not the... Yeah, it's not the same.

77
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,630
It's not...

78
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,250
The same.

79
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,830
So I had to... Uh... Two blocks.

80
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,550
I can't believe there's so many blocks in my Minecraft game.

81
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,410
Uh... Um... I... But I'm just so used to using like... Shaders and stuff.

82
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,030
So I had to like get that working.

83
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,750
And after that.

84
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,930
They're like, remember to tweet this?

85
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,750
Remember to tweet that?

86
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,710
Remember to do... Do this?

87
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,310
I was like, okay, okay.

88
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:04,670
I know I should have done it last night, but I was going to last night if I didn't take a nap, okay?

89
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,510
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,510
I took a nap.

91
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,970
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,410
I was so tired.

93
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,270
But it's okay now.

94
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,950
I got everything done.

95
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,830
Alright, so, um, before we go in more detail about the Minecraft stuff, I do want to talk about a special announcement.

96
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,770
We're doing the announcement right now.

97
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,890
We're gonna do the announcement right now.

98
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,770
Um, so, the special announcement is...

99
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,370
What the f-

100
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,220
Wow!

101
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,180
Yes!

102
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,660
That is our little special announcement!

103
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,260
I am hosting a game jam!

104
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,780
Or you could call it Doki.

105
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,140
Doki jam!

106
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,340
Uh, but yes, um, uh, actually, uh, this is something I've been wanting to do for the longest time.

107
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,700
This was so, like, they worked so fast.

108
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:35,580
Like, I think, like, they, uh, basically, um, I delegated this to Silent Kuroki, who is a project manager for this project, um, who is also in charge.

109
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,140
Uh, uh, Silent Kuroki is also in charge of the Doki SMP!

110
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
So, you know, both announcements just tied in together.

111
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,100
Um, anyway!

112
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:52,300
So, I contacted Kano, um, who was- who has done, um, the HoloLive game jams in the past.

113
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,800
So, if you've seen those before, um, uh, seen the game jams, uh, they've hosted before in the past, uh, I've seen the work they've done.

114
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:06,380
Uh, it was- and they also helped work on- they were also the one that did the, uh, the Dragoon, uh, race test.

115
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,380
So, they were also part of that project as well.

116
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,680
And after the Dragoon race test, they, like, they were the ones that helped with, um, coding and developing the game for that.

117
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,160
And, and, um, uh, after that, uh... Oh, does it overlap another big game jam?!

118
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,100
Wait, what game jam is going on?!

119
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,560
I didn't even know that.

120
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,920
What do you mean it overlaps?

121
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,080
Wait, no!

122
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,100
Okay, wait, I actually did not know it overlaps with another game jam.

123
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,140
I didn't...

124
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,200
Oh, oops.

125
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:54,820
I mean, if there is scheduling problems, maybe we'll extend the deadline and everything.

126
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:04,860
But if there's no actual big overlap, if there's no actual big overlap, then we'll keep it the date as it is.

127
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,380
Anyway, back on topic.

128
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,220
We got one guide.

129
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,240
Yeah, I'm just...

130
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,580
Maybe move it.

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,380
The reason why they chose the dates, because I was asking...

132
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,460
They were ones that proposed the dates for me.

133
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:27,180
And it was actually supposed to happen earlier, but I pushed it because there's just too many things going on.

134
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,720
And I wanted to...

135
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,480
I wanted, like, more time to...

136
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,660
To space out all these things together.

137
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,700
But they proposed this date because they said that...

138
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,960
They wanted it to be before school.

139
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,240
So before...

140
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,700
Some dragoons have to go back to school, go back to university.

141
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,100
Or, you know...

142
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,920
Not just university.

143
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,660
Maybe high school.

144
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,180
I don't know.

145
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,820
Maybe even middle school.

146
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,260
I don't know.

147
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,820
Maybe I have some talented prodigies in my chat right now.

148
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,320
But yes, it starts on August 2nd.

149
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,120
And you have two weeks to make a game with a bunch of other dragoons.

150
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,020
So, not elementary.

151
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,000
If you're in elementary, you're not allowed to watch me because you're not over the age of 13.

152
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,300
And technically, you're not allowed to, like, chat in my channel if you're not over 13.

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,440
Anyway.

154
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,120
So, for those who don't know what a game jam is...

155
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,080
Basically, it's a bunch of people coming together to make a game within a time limit.

156
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,220
So, a bunch of developers, programmers, coders...

157
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,460
I mean, that's all in their developers.

158
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:37,900
I don't know.

159
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,040
I said developers, like, three times, apparently.

160
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,640
Artists, writers, project managers, all coming together to try and make a game from scratch.

161
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,780
And it starts on August 2nd.

162
00:12:50,280 --> 00:13:08,460
Like I said, after I worked with Kano with the dragon horse race test, I saw, like, his portfolio and saw that he has organized the Halive game gems, the fan game gems.

163
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,760
And I figured this was something I actually really wanted to do for the longest time.

164
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,440
I've participated in game gems before in the past when I was in university.

165
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,080
As an artist.

166
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,160
And, like, semi-coder.

167
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,660
So, this was something that I really wanted to do.

168
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,760
Because I love seeing...

169
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,680
It's really fun.

170
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,880
Being in a game gem is incredibly fun.

171
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,180
And especially getting to work with everybody together.

172
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,720
Try and make something out of nothing.

173
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,860
And, um...

174
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,480
Uh...

175
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,600
And...

176
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh, the link...

177
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,480
For someone that's, like, saying the link for the instructions video is broken.

178
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,340
Um...

179
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,620
Are you talking about the Minecraft server?

180
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,660
You have to be a member to be able to see the link.

181
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,100
So, that's why...

182
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,800
If you can't access the link regarding the Minecraft server, it's...

183
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
It's only because you...

184
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,700
You need to have...

185
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,500
Like, you need to be a member.

186
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,060
Um...

187
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,240
Anyway...

188
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,100
Uh...

189
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,660
Yeah, because the server is for members only.

190
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,240
But I'll be streaming all the...

191
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,440
I'll be streaming the server as a public stream.

192
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,600
Anyway, back to the game gem.

193
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:08,860
Sorry.

194
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm, like, going back and forth.

195
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,040
Uh...

196
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,180
Um...

197
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,360
But yes, let me tweet it out real quick.

198
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,260
The instructions will be on the Ichio page.

199
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,360
So...

200
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,760
Uh...

201
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,440
Can...

202
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,840
Can silent croaky up...

203
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,500
I don't know if they posted the...

204
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
The published the Ichio yet.

205
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,020
Let me check real quick.

206
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,260
Yes!

207
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,400
It has been published.

208
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,820
Um...

209
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,100
I...

210
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,180
Trying to remember if...

211
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,000
There is a community discord that has been set up for the game jam.

212
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,480
So let me tweet it out real quick.

213
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,240
Yay!

214
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,020
Boop!

215
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,480
Alright.

216
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,800
So...

217
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,180
For anyone that wants to know more details about the game jam.

218
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,560
For those who want to join the discord server.

219
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,500
The community server.

220
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,100
Uh...

221
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,320
To form your teams and everything.

222
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,980
It is all in...

223
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,540
Um...

224
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,500
The Ichio page.

225
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,120
Um...

226
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,520
But yes.

227
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,840
There will be prizes.

228
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,440
Uh...

229
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,980
Um...

230
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,180
And everyone that participates will receive something.

231
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,420
Um...

232
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,000
I can't say what it is yet because...

233
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,300
Uh...

234
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,140
We're still trying to finalize the details regarding the...

235
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,400
It's a physical prize.

236
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,600
Maybe.

237
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,160
It could...

238
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,980
There is a potential that it could be a physical prize.

239
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,340
But like...

240
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,760
You have an option to like...

241
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
Not take the physical prize.

242
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,140
And get like a...

243
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,600
Um...

244
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,320
Get like...

245
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,900
Like exchange it for like currency within my store.

246
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,380
Like...

247
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,540
Within the Doki merch store.

248
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,720
Uh...

249
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,260
But...

250
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,720
Like...

251
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
The first option is a physical prize.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,480
But like...

253
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,940
If something...

254
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,140
You know...

255
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,480
You want privacy concerns and stuff like that.

256
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,180
Um...

257
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,080
Obviously we want re-handling the address.

258
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,280
I won't DC any addresses and everything...

259
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:43,880
And anything.

260
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,900
But...

261
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,820
You can also exchange it for a...

262
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,120
A non-physical prize.

263
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:48,860
Which...

264
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,100
Might end up turning into a physical prize.

265
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,560
Um...

266
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,760
But that's where like...

267
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,140
Everyone who participates at least gets something.

268
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,780
Um...

269
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,300
Uh...

270
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,600
But yes.

271
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,500
First place is 2,000.

272
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,340
Second place is 1,000.

273
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,100
Um...

274
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,380
Split amongst your team by the way.

275
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,800
This is split.

276
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,580
Not each person.

277
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,620
But it will be split amongst your team.

278
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,800
And then third place is...

279
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,380
Five hundred dollars.

280
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,440
So...

281
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,040
Um...

282
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:15,800
And...

283
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,080
Uh...

284
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,480
At the end of the game jam.

285
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,900
Of course I'll be playing...

286
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,260
Uh...

287
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,600
Some of these games on stream.

288
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,500
And everything.

289
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,940
And then obviously...

290
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,780
You dragoons will also be able to play these games on stream.

291
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,160
And...

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,440
Um...

293
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,540
And then we're...

294
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:29,740
Uh...

295
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,440
Me and my team will figure out the winners!

296
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,020
Ha ha ha ha!

297
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,100
Ha ha ha!

298
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,100
Uh...

299
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,460
But yes.

300
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,120
It's very exciting.

301
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,260
I'm super...

302
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,820
Excited about this project.

303
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,800
Huge shout out to everybody that worked on it.

304
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,960
It was mostly like...

305
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,720
The entire team.

306
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,320
Like...

307
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,580
Cause I said I delegated this.

308
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500
I delegated this to Silent Kuroki.

309
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,460
So this was basically their baby for this project.

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,360
Um...

311
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,500
All I did was just like...

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,300
Uh...

313
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,420
Basically approve stuff.

314
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,320
Or if I had any feedback or anything.

315
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,180
Um...

316
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,920
Like I was like...

317
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,080
You know...

318
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,880
At the end of the...

319
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,860
The check process...

320
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,320
Like the...

321
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,200
Um...

322
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,140
The end of like the final checks and everything.

323
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:05,720
Um...

324
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,540
For their decisions that they wanna make.

325
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,140
So...

326
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,620
Huge shout out to the entire team.

327
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,520
Um...

328
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,380
For working on this.

329
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,100
And I'm super excited for the Doki Jam.

330
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,420
I'm really, really excited.

331
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,820
I cannot wait to see...

332
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,260
Um...

333
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,300
To see like all the hard work.

334
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,040
And...

335
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,960
From all you dragons.

336
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,800
In doing this.

337
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,400
And play all your games and everything.

338
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,240
Like I said...

339
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,940
It's something I've...

340
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,680
Always wanted to do for the longest time.

341
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,080
So I'm very, very happy to...

342
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,940
Have this project come into fruition.

343
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,380
And...

344
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,000
Uh...

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
To try out your games.

346
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,580
Uh...

347
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,340
But yes...

348
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,900
Um...

349
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,980
If there's nothing...

350
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,620
If we feel like there's no actual big obstacle.

351
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,660
In terms of like the dates.

352
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,760
We'll just keep it as it is.

353
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,300
So July...

354
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,740
August...

355
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,840
It starts at August 2nd.

356
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,760
And then...

357
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,080
Two week timer.

358
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,960
Tick tock.

359
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,560
Tick tock.

360
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,200
So you have until August 2nd.

361
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,380
To form your team.

362
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,160
Um...

363
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:55,860
Anyway...

364
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,640
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

365
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,160
Alright.

366
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,340
The other announcement.

367
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,140
Well as you guys know.

368
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,300
The Doki SMP was the other announcement.

369
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,400
Before I begin.

370
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,860
I wanna give a...

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
Huge shout out to...

372
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,560
Um...

373
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,280
To...

374
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,780
Uh...

375
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,520
Our sponsor.

376
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,640
Uh...

377
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,700
So every future Minecraft stream.

378
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,960
On the Doki SMP.

379
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,160
Is sponsored.

380
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,340
Um...

381
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,060
By...

382
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,460
Uh...

383
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,280
By CloudNord.

384
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,040
Who is a Minecraft...

385
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,280
Who...

386
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,600
I mean, not just Minecraft, but they host... Basically, they are a service for providing servers and stuff.

387
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,580
And they were the ones that provided our Minecraft server.

388
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,600
And our agreement was that I will be streaming Minecraft at least once every month.

389
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,220
So, at least once every month, I will be on the Doki SMP server.

390
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,360
So, I will be here streaming... Like, I will be streaming it publicly and everything.

391
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,960
And, you know, playing Minecraft Wiki Dragoons.

392
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,820
So, they are our sponsor and the host of the entire SMP.

393
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,800
So, for those who don't know about the Dragoo Minecraft server, there was a first attempt at the server.

394
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,420
And it failed.

395
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,780
I will own up to it.

396
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,040
It failed.

397
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,740
Because I was not expecting how much work it was overall.

398
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,920
And obviously, I had a lot of stuff going on around that time.

399
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,740
So, I couldn't keep up with it and everything.

400
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,840
Because it was just me working on...

401
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,440
It was, like, not just me, but, like, I was the main point of contact.

402
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,380
And, like, I didn't really...

403
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,120
I didn't really have, like, another staff at that time to help me with this.

404
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,580
The best my manager could do, my manager was in the group chat, was just poke me to be, like, respond to this, respond to that.

405
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,340
But, obviously, like, it was very hard to get a hold of me at that time.

406
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,320
Because there's so many things going on behind the scenes that I couldn't...

407
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,180
I couldn't really do much on that, like, with that server.

408
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,300
And because of that, though, there was a whole issue with whitelisting and stuff like that.

409
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,820
Because I had to do it...

410
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:13,600
Me and the mods had to do it by hand because we didn't have a proper system in place regarding whitelisting people as well as, like, removing people from the whitelist.

411
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,380
Because this is the server.

412
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:26,620
This server was only for members, but we publicly streamed the server due to the Minecraft TOS and stuff like that.

413
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:35,680
Because, you know, like, I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Minecraft TOS, you're not allowed to have, like, paywall streams regarding Minecraft.

414
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,520
So, like, you know, that was going on and everything.

415
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:51,360
So, it was very hard to figure out how to properly do a... make a system for it for the dragoons who are, you know, who are on the server.

416
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,380
So, this took a very long time to figure out.

417
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:06,760
Throughout that, our old development team had to back out from this project because they had... they wanted to pivot to something else.

418
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:17,640
And, obviously, that put a huge wrench, uh... huge wrench in our plans because that delayed the grand reopening because we had a lot of stuff we had to fix.

419
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,160
We had a lot of things to do on the server.

420
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:30,460
So, because of that, we had to, um, we had to, like, hire a new team and, uh, you know, I don't know if you guys remember seeing a tweet about me trying to find a...

421
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:36,080
Uh, a Minecraft, like, administer or someone who knows how to, like, do...

422
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,740
I don't even remember.

423
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,360
That tweet was drafted by SilentCrokey in terms of, like, what they needed.

424
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,160
And I don't even remember what they needed.

425
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,220
I just... it was, like, some admin developer for Minecraft.

426
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,240
Like, I don't remember what tweet I made.

427
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,000
I...

428
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,820
Like, oh, yeah, the system admin.

429
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:06,720
And, yeah, yeah, so, um, so, yeah, so we had to hire a new system admin, we had to hire new developers, and stuff like that, and everything, um, for all of that.

430
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:19,460
So, like I said, the whole Doki SMP thing took a very long time to rehaul, to restructure, to, like, because we also had to rewrite the plugins and everything to work for the newest Minecraft updates.

431
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:34,920
So, um, obviously, a lot of stuff had to be rewritten and, um, redone for the newest Minecraft update, because the plugin, um, the plugin didn't work, uh, for, like, newer servers, and there were some issues with some of the plugins.

432
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:48,720
Um, but in the end, after around, like, I guess, like, half a year, slash half, almost a year, slash half a year, we finally are able to do a grand reopening of the Doki SMP.

433
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:59,980
Um, and, we have a new system in place for whitelisting, um, and, because it was that, basically, I do have an instruction for everyone.

434
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:08,140
If you are a member, you have to be a member for this, um, but, but, but, I, I even made, like, an instructions PNG.

435
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:15,120
Alright, so, you click on the setting cog wheel, right there, and then, you click connections.

436
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:23,920
And then, in connections, you go here, with the profile here, you go here, and then you click your YouTube thing.

437
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,920
And then, you connect your YouTube, your YouTube account.

438
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,520
That is membered, by the way.

439
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,280
That is membered, um, because some people might connect to a different YouTube channel.

440
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,400
But it has to be a membered, a membered, uh, YouTube channel for this channel.

441
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,060
And after that, you will see this pop up.

442
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,220
And it's called the Doki Minecraft SMP.

443
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,340
And you just click join.

444
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:57,100
Um, after, after all, after you click join, it should automatically, um, put you in the Discord server.

445
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,200
And from there, they will give you your, the, the Minecraft IP.

446
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm not showing the Minecraft IP yet, because I'm not in.

447
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,940
I won't be in, I won't be the first one on the server.

448
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:16,180
So, the moment I am on the server, the, the Discord server will reveal the Minecraft IP for everyone, um, that's a member.

449
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,060
And in the, this, in the Doki SMP server.

450
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:31,420
Uh, um, um, so yes, this is, this is, uh, members only, uh, to play on the server.

451
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,520
And, uh, it already has, we just can't join.

452
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,440
Wait, oh, oh, the IP is in the Discord.

453
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,220
Oh, okay, they revealed the IP.

454
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,860
All right, cool.

455
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,680
All right, that's cool.

456
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,640
Okay, apparently you guys just aren't allowed in yet.

457
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,320
All right, so the moment, the floodgates will open the moment I'm in the server.

458
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,400
Anyway, anyway, what was I saying?

459
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,940
Uh, we have a new system in place now.

460
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,620
Um, the instruction, basically, we have a whitelist system.

461
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,140
We have a bot that does the whitelisting for us.

462
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,920
That was programmed.

463
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,480
And, um, the moment you're unmembered, you're kicked out.

464
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:16,120
So, the moment you're unmembered, you have lost your right to enter the server.

465
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,820
You're still in the Discord.

466
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,600
But, uh, you are, you'll be kicked out of the server, the Minecraft server.

467
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,220
So, yeah, exiled.

468
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,360
Until you're remembered.

469
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,700
When you're remembered, then the bot puts you back in.

470
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,680
Yeah, it's like, you know, you get fired and you have to, like, like, hand in, hand in everything.

471
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,000
Like, hand in your card.

472
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,320
So, remember me.

473
00:25:50,640 --> 00:26:00,880
Um, um, so, the, the moment you're, you're remembered, remember, the moment you're remembered, the whitelist will acknowledge it.

474
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,340
And, like, you're let back into the Minecraft server.

475
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,460
Um, but, yeah, like I said, huge shout-out to the team, um, for working really hard on this.

476
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,080
This server is made for you guys.

477
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,000
There will be a separate fund.

478
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,580
Um, more details will be on the Discord server.

479
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,480
But, there will be a separate fund established to pay for the devs.

480
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,700
And, uh, the devs and maybe, like, artists.

481
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,200
We're going to put, like, you know, extra cosmetics or resource packs in there.

482
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,100
Um, so, and developing more plugins or, like, more structures in there.

483
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,160
So, there will be a separate fund there for you dragoons.

484
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,840
And I won't be able to touch this fund.

485
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,140
And it will go directly towards the developers and, um, um, and any of the staff or, like, mods that are working on the server.

486
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,860
Um, and you guys can decide what you want to want for the server.

487
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,620
Like, you guys can, like, you know, give suggestions and everything.

488
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,320
Like, what kind of plugins you want.

489
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,400
What kind of quality of life changes you want for this.

490
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,160
Um, and, uh, like, you know, ideas you want to do.

491
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,680
Events you want to host on there and stuff like that.

492
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,320
So, we're going to have, make it more, so that's more personalized to you dragoons.

493
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,740
And make, make it fun for you guys.

494
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,360
Um, um, does it have fancy cool plugins?

495
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,380
Right now, it's mostly quality of life stuff.

496
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,680
Um, there, there is, like, I don't know if the stadium has been implemented.

497
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,280
Um, or anything, but there are, like, some quality of life plugins in there.

498
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,980
Uh, and you don't have to download anything on your own end.

499
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,680
You just have, basically, you just have to log in and you should be fine.

500
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,400
Like, and, like, the server will basically install it, uh, for you.

501
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Um, um, but yeah, this whole, uh, this whole journey was a very big learning experience for me.

502
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,500
But now we have a whole new team now and a support staff, too, for the Doki SMP.

503
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,360
And I hope that, you know, um, it, uh, I hope you guys enjoy your time.

504
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,300
Um, and, like, bond with other dragoons and stuff.

505
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,760
And make new friends and everything.

506
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,400
And, you know, have wars if you want.

507
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,580
Like, I don't know, have another civil war.

508
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,060
That's fine by me.

509
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,340
Just, I just want you guys to have a good time.

510
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:23,460
Uh, but now we have a huge, uh, better support system to, um, to facilitate everything.

511
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,180
And for you guys to, like, you know, um, much more, much more organized.

512
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,420
Not like last time where it was, like, pure anarchy.

513
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,260
We, uh, we actually have a support staff for it.

514
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,400
Um, now for those who are wondering about the old SMP.

515
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,100
What about 1.0?

516
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,460
You can still access 1.0 on the main server.

517
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,200
Um, you just have to...

518
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,460
It's just, it's just as a spectator.

519
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,300
You can look through...

520
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,560
It's like a museum tour.

521
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,100
So, you're like, um, you're like, I don't know, you're in Greece looking at Pompeii.

522
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,680
Sorry, is it in Greece or in Rome?

523
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,820
I don't, I don't know my geography.

524
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,840
It's like a history museum.

525
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,080
Uh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

526
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,160
Um, but, uh, basically, you can, as a spectator.

527
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,760
Oh, it's in Italy.

528
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,700
You know what?

529
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,500
Three out of...

530
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,070
Three...

531
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,790
I got the, I got the continent right.

532
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,030
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

533
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,250
At least I knew it was in Europe, you know?

534
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,050
I was close.

535
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,230
I was... I was close, guys.

536
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,350
That's a... yikes.

537
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,970
It's a really low bar.

538
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,690
It's like, you know, going to Europe.

539
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,450
I should just say, it's like going to Europe to see Pompeii.

540
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:56,550
So, you can, as a... you can, like, fly around the old SMP and look at, like, relics of the past, you know.

541
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,110
And see what the old builds were.

542
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,270
So, in this new... in the new Minecraft server, you can claim lands, as always.

543
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,810
There's a claiming feature.

544
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,130
And...

545
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:10,810
And...

546
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:17,370
We will be going... logging in and claiming our land to create DokiTown again.

547
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:22,950
And...

548
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,030
What else?

549
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,490
What else?

550
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:24,950
Oh, yeah.

551
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,030
And you can join a faction.

552
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,590
There will be more stuff.

553
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,970
We will plan...

554
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,570
I have plans for more things to do regarding the faction thing.

555
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:36,450
So, you can either be a long goon, a chonky goon, an egg goon, or a regular drag goon.

556
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,110
So, you can claim a faction.

557
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,470
There is group chats, too.

558
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,910
If you're in a group, you can group up with other drag goons.

559
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,190
And there's, like, specific group chats for... for you guys.

560
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,770
So, the chatting system isn't, like, a huge mess.

561
00:30:53,890 --> 00:31:01,190
I think that's all there is to say about the grand reopening of the Doki SMP.

562
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:07,150
Like I said, we are... we have big plans for more stuff to add on the server in the future.

563
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,250
Okay.

564
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,590
But for now, let's just get started.

565
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,770
For those who want to join the server, like I said, you have to be a member to access the Dragoon server.

566
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,750
For those who are like, how do I get in?

567
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,070
All right.

568
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,270
Let me put some music on before we start this.

569
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,450
Because I don't want... need some tunes.

570
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,450
All right.

571
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,710
Sound guy, if you're here, we need your help.

572
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,930
Make sure everything will be okay.

573
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:37,930
All right.

574
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,730
Let's get in.

575
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,250
All right.

576
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,430
All right.

577
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,010
Here you go.

578
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,070
Let me in.

579
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,210
All right.

580
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,310
There you go.

581
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:04,030
So, I believe this is the... this is the only PvP save zone.

582
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,310
So, this is the town hall.

583
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:10,750
We will... I'm planning on remaking this town hall to make it more like a saloon.

584
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,210
Like a west... an actual western town.

585
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:14,930
Um...

586
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,710
So... so you can see here.

587
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,330
This is how you claim.

588
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,970
But like, there's a selection tool for claiming.

589
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,550
What the fuck?

590
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,710
Oh, yeah.

591
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,510
Oh, my skin is still a...

592
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I forgot.

593
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,660
I forgot that.

594
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,380
Um...

595
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,560
My... my...

596
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,520
Are these both...

597
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,060
This?

598
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,620
Are they both the...

599
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,060
Oh, my God.

600
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,300
They're both the same thing.

601
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,200
They're...

602
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,040
They're both the same.

603
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,580
I don't know why I have that.

604
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,260
Um...

605
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,540
But...

606
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,140
Why is Mehdi in here already?

607
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,940
What the...

608
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,260
How did he get in?

609
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Okay.

610
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,260
I forgot...

611
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,780
Oh, whatever.

612
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,280
It's fine.

613
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,760
I'm committed.

614
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,860
I'm just giving me a...

615
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,040
I'm blending in.

616
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,700
I'm...

617
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,380
I'm...

618
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,440
I'm camouflaged in.

619
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,440
All right.

620
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,420
All right.

621
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,560
Admins!

622
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,620
Let them in!

623
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,960
Let them in!

624
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,080
He said...

625
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,120
Let...

626
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,640
Oh, okay.

627
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,460
They shut down.

628
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:25,780
Okay.

629
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,360
I...

630
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,540
I...

631
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,060
I...

632
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,200
And...

633
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,860
Um...

634
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,360
And I was like, how is there a Dragoon in here already?

635
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,480
Open the gates!

636
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:36,960
Okay.

637
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,280
All right.

638
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,440
Give me a sec.

639
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,100
Am I in?

640
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,440
Okay.

641
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,320
Wait.

642
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:46,960
Did I...

643
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,020
Did I whitelist myself?

644
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,500
Yeah, I did.

645
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:48,780
Okay.

646
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
I was gonna say...

647
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,960
I was like, why am I required to whitelist myself?

648
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,880
What the...

649
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Oh, my God.

650
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,840
Oh, my...

651
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,220
Where am I?

652
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,500
Okay.

653
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:56,760
Now.

654
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,020
Okay.

655
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,800
All right.

656
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,020
Let them in!

657
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,440
That's right!

658
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,940
I was gonna say...

659
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,260
Do I...

660
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,020
I was gonna say...

661
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,720
Am I required to let my...

662
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,280
Like, whitelist myself in?

663
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,240
Oh, nice.

664
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,140
Let them all in!

665
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah, I was gonna say, that lightning was fucking...

666
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,820
Metal.

667
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,020
That was looking metal as fuck.

668
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,020
I was like, holy shit.

669
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,620
That's hardcore.

670
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,560
All right.

671
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:23,760
All right.

672
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,040
Bring the game up a little bit.

673
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,960
Like, no problem.

674
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,740
All right.

675
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,760
All right!

676
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,420
Get in here, dragons!

677
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,940
Everybody, get in!

678
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,100
Pick your faction!

679
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,380
That's right!

680
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,320
Oh, my God!

681
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:42,800
All right.

682
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,120
So, this is one of the mods.

683
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,220
Don't piss him off, because he will kill you.

684
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
So, this is...

685
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
I think some of you guys might remember Silent Thanos.

686
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,100
He will kill you if you piss him off.

687
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,560
He's the one...

688
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,040
He's one of the more like...

689
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,940
Oh, I was so worried.

690
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,700
He is the no-nonsense mod.

691
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,580
He is the...

692
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,660
He is the one where you do not fuck with on the server, from what I've heard.

693
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,480
It's not...

694
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,360
He is not friendly.

695
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,820
He is the...

696
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,600
The hello, everybody!

697
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,420
Yes!

698
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,760
If you were in the server before, you might have some...

699
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,120
You might have your old gear.

700
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,760
So, everyone that like had stuff in their inventory actually sort of kept it.

701
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,100
Uh...

702
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,240
Um...

703
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,940
Um...

704
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,840
But...

705
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,420
Um...

706
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,820
Everything else is wiped up.

707
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,980
Does it have proximity?

708
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
If you have...

709
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,640
If you have the...

710
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,240
The...

711
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,560
What is it?

712
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,460
The mod with the voice chat on?

713
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,440
Um...

714
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,400
We do have the voice chat mod on.

715
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,460
Um...

716
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,480
So, uh...

717
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,000
If you already...

718
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,320
Because like that, you need to install it on your own end as well.

719
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,280
So...

720
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,340
Um...

721
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,980
If you already have that on, then there is proximity chat.

722
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:11,720
I don't have it on because, like, I want to make sure that, uh, I just want to make sure that, you know, you know, no one says anything bad on my stream.

723
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,640
Just, you know, just the little things.

724
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,140
Yeah, so there is a, apparently there is the 1% because some people actually kept the stuff in the inventory.

725
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,700
Uh, I believe my coordinates is a 0-0, I think.

726
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,100
I think this is 0-0, right?

727
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,620
Uh, the old land claims are still around.

728
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,380
Wait, really?

729
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,640
Wait, did we not wipe the claims?

730
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,140
We should have wiped the claims.

731
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,700
Yeah, there's nobody here.

732
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,780
Yeah, see?

733
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,260
There's no way the old land claims are still around.

734
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,160
There's no way.

735
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:57,780
Because, uh, Um, because, like, these claims are all new.

736
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,920
Alright, the rich get richer.

737
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,960
Alright, I'm gonna create my- my area next to the- next to here.

738
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,640
I wonder if this is the same- I think this is.

739
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,040
Okay, if I see the ocean that way, then it's the same land.

740
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,200
It's the same- what's it called?

741
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,600
Uh, the same seed.

742
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,860
So, they wiped everything.

743
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,180
Uh, but you were on the- oh my god, it's the same fucking seed.

744
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,500
Okay, okay.

745
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,480
I swear- I swear- I swear to god.

746
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,200
I know you guys know we're the end.

747
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,160
Okay, we're gonna do the ender dragon together.

748
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,620
This time.

749
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,780
Okay, everyone?

750
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,600
We're gonna- we're gonna do the ender dragon together.

751
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,600
Guys, okay, this- I don't remember where I used to live.

752
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,260
I actually don't.

753
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,240
I remember I was on a hill.

754
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,900
Uh, um, okay, we'll do it soon.

755
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,500
We'll do it soon.

756
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,760
I just need to claim my lands.

757
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,180
Guys, you remember where I lived?

758
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:13,160
I remember I lived on a hill, so I can- I'd be like, Simba, everywhere the sun touches belongs to you.

759
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,320
Uh, uh...

760
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,140
I- I- I- I need- I think it was here, right?

761
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,480
I'd be like, Simba.

762
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,900
If I don't remember, it's been so long.

763
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,420
It's been so fucking long.

764
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,340
It's like, here, right?

765
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,800
Yeah, this was it, right?

766
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,440
Yeah, this was it.

767
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:36,920
This was it.

768
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,820
I remember- this was it.

769
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,660
This was my land.

770
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,500
Oh my god, give me.

771
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,340
Give me your gear right now.

772
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,340
Give me a- I- I see what you have.

773
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,140
I need- give me your fireworks right now.

774
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,320
And your gear.

775
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,560
This is a holdup.

776
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,440
This is- I'll kick you- I'll un-whitelist you.

777
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,140
No, I want your fireworks and your cape.

778
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,740
Now.

779
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,330
All right, take that cape off the back- off your back.

780
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,070
I'm gonna get out of here.

781
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,710
I'm tired.

782
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,670
That's right.

783
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,950
Don't make me use force.

784
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,510
Don't...

785
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,510
Give me your lecture right now!

786
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,670
Don't make me use force on you!

787
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,830
The land isn't claimed so I can PvP.

788
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:47,910
That's right!

789
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,370
Alright, nice.

790
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,810
Okay, now I'll claim my land.

791
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,890
Now don't give in.

792
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,850
Alright, this is new Joki Town.

793
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,330
I'm trying to remember how to do this.

794
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:07,090
I'm trying to claim my land.

795
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,050
A behind-away robbery.

796
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,730
Everything the sun touches is yours.

797
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,630
It's so cute.

798
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,650
Alright.

799
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,710
I think I'm doing it correctly, right?

800
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,350
I think?

801
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,010
Did I claim it?

802
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,270
I don't remember.

803
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,370
Ow!

804
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,830
Okay, wait.

805
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,730
Okay.

806
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,050
Alright, I claimed it.

807
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:37,370
Okay.

808
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,310
Lands claim.

809
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,890
Did I do it?

810
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,870
Oh, nice.

811
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,350
I successfully claimed this chunk of land.

812
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:49,530
Okay.

813
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,570
And then... Um... What do I do?

814
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,330
What do I... What do I do after that?

815
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,330
New claims... Will belong... Okay.

816
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,370
Okay, I got it.

817
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:07,990
Wait.

818
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,590
Okay, wait.

819
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,250
How do I...

820
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,510
Time to get boxed in.

821
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,990
Not if I claim more!

822
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,160
If I start claiming more land, you can't box me in.

823
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,420
Okay.

824
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,620
Okay.

825
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:31,860
Alright.

826
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,030
Slash...

827
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,330
Claim...

828
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,460
Claim...

829
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,380
Lands...

830
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,260
Auto...

831
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:41,840
Fill...

832
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,360
Oh, okay.

833
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,980
Slash...

834
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,290
Claim...

835
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,240
Radius...

836
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,400
Did I do it?

837
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,920
Which one's mine?

838
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,080
Which one's mine?

839
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,880
Claim...

840
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,520
Okay.

841
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,040
Is this all mine?

842
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,460
I think this is all mine.

843
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,640
I think this is all mine.

844
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,920
Oh my god.

845
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,860
I'm trying to remember, guys.

846
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,600
Is this still my lands?

847
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,500
I...

848
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,980
Oh my god.

849
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,960
Everybody's already claiming so much.

850
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,720
I...

851
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,820
Okay.

852
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,520
Claim...

853
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,280
Guys, we are basically stress testing everything out right now.

854
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,880
So...

855
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,580
Um...

856
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,080
Oh!

857
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,820
Who logged out before in their land?

858
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,500
Can't claim?

859
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,100
Alright Moz, you heard that?

860
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,840
Fix that.

861
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,100
Fix that, guys.

862
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,740
Guys, I need to look at the instructions again.

863
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,500
It's been... it's been so long since I've played the land.

864
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,840
Let me... let me... what are the commands?

865
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,360
Okay.

866
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,840
Um... in-game commands.

867
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,940
Oh, land.

868
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,000
Rename.

869
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,420
Okay.

870
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,540
Land set spot.

871
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,080
Okay.

872
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,140
Okay.

873
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,660
Okay, this is my spot.

874
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,600
Okay.

875
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,620
Land set spot.

876
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,380
What?

877
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,420
What?

878
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,080
Um... um... wait.

879
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,700
Land rename Doki Land.

880
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,180
Okay, nice.

881
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,200
For... what?

882
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,020
Wait.

883
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,740
Why does it say someone else owns this land?

884
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:39,880
What?

885
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,100
Why does it...

886
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,640
What?

887
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,040
What?

888
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,180
Okay, so what's that?

889
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:48,980
Wait.

890
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,200
I renamed your land?

891
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,960
Where is... wait.

892
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,940
TP... spot.

893
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,540
This is my spot.

894
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,020
TP spot.

895
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,320
Oh my god.

896
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,140
Where am I?

897
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,660
Wait.

898
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,880
My land.

899
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,360
What?

900
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,420
What?

901
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,380
My land.

902
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,000
Come on.

903
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,880
Wait.

904
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,040
Slash map.

905
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,800
Wait, but I'm trusted.

906
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,760
I'm trusted in this land.

907
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,340
Is this not mine?

908
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,340
What?

909
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,400
This is...

910
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,980
This is... your land is our land.

911
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,020
This is not my land?

912
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,380
Guys, this is... these instructions... okay.

913
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,340
Land... set... spawn.

914
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,380
But like...

915
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,520
What?

916
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,800
Am I alive?

917
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,400
Am I alive?

918
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Am I alive?

919
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
I heard something explode.

920
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,680
Oh, I'm alive.

921
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,140
Okay.

922
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,020
It was my land.

923
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,160
What happened to my land?

924
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,060
What?

925
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,500
Wait.

926
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,180
TP...

927
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,220
Oh my god.

928
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:15,820
What happened?

929
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:16,980
What?

930
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,440
Okay, guys.

931
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,120
Guys, we might... can we reset... okay, guys, we're gonna try... I'm gonna ask them to reset all land claims.

932
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,320
Can we...

933
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,880
Can we reset all land claims?

934
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,260
People can't claim lands.

935
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,080
And I want my land... and I want my land back.

936
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,440
Okay, we're looking into that right now.

937
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:59,500
We're resetting every... Don't worry, all land claims will be... And we'll full wipe... Wait, no, okay.

938
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,560
Full wipe everything but my inventory.

939
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,680
Alright, guys, give me your shit.

940
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:11,240
Give me... And full wipe everyone's inventory but mine.

941
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,220
Is it actually possible?

942
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,040
Alright, guys.

943
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,940
We're gonna full wipe everybody's inventory but my inventory.

944
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,360
So if you guys want me to receive anything right now, chat it over.

945
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,240
Don't worry, I'll give it back, guys.

Okay, the seed will be the same... Don't worry, I'll give everything back.

948
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,020
I'll be your bank.

949
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,480
Alright, if anyone wants to do a safe tip of deposit on me, you can right now.

950
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,240
I'll go back through the city hall.

951
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,160
Where is the city hall?

952
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,240
Ooh, it's the wild.

953
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,360
Guys, oh, there it is.

954
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,480
Alright, I'll have... Don't worry, guys.

Go to the city hall.

957
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,600
I'll be your safety deposit bank.

958
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,260
And I'll return everything.

959
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:18,940
Don't worry.

960
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,580
Don't worry, guys.

961
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,960
Alright, don't worry.

962
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,720
Give me your armor.

963
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:34,640
If anyone wants me to safeguard their armor, their netherite armor and everything, I can safeguard it all.

964
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,200
I'll be your safety deposit box, guys.

965
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,180
Do not worry.

966
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:48,200
If anyone has anything important that they want me to hold on to, I'm here for you, guys.

967
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,280
Don't worry, guys.

968
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:49,820
Don't worry.

969
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,960
The bank is here.

970
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,120
I'll safeguard it for all of you.

971
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,100
So, I asked them to wipe everybody's inventory, guys.

972
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,740
So, except for mine.

973
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,680
Except for mine.

974
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,000
Alright, but we're keeping the old seed.

975
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,960
But we're keeping the old seed.

976
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,000
We just need to...

977
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,800
Yeah, alright, guys.

978
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:20,400
Yeah?

979
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,240
Oh, don't worry.

980
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,280
I got you, guys.

981
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:22,920
I got you.

982
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,260
Alright.

983
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,340
Alright.

984
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,540
If you guys... Okay, wait.

985
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,540
Let me make a chest.

986
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,580
A bank chest.

987
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,300
Okay, actually... Someone make the safety deposit box, guys.

988
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,800
Alright.

989
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,200
Alright.

990
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,100
Let's go here.

991
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,480
Alright.

992
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,580
You make the safety deposit...

993
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,340
Make the safety deposit box.

994
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:43,800
Wait.

995
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:44,920
And here.

996
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,260
Alright.

997
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,340
And then...

998
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,460
Everyone that wants to deposit their items.

999
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:52,860
Um...

1000
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:53,080
Wait.

1001
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,760
Can we not put it?

1002
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,380
Or maybe here?

1003
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,960
Oh, my God.

1004
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
Oh, my God.

1005
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,020
The ender dragon has died yet again.

1006
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,020
Alright.

1007
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,120
I need any... Someone to make...

1008
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,780
A safety deposit box.

1009
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,820
So, I can make sure...

1010
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,500
I can hold all your stuff together.

1011
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,960
We are going to reset...

1012
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,200
The land claims.

1013
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,520
And all your inventory.

1014
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,240
So that there's no more 1% anymore.

1015
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,560
Um...

1016
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,440
So, there won't be a 1%.

1017
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,640
And everybody has to start from the beginning.

1018
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:31,940
Alright.

1019
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,000
Alright.

1020
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,200
Where's the box?

1021
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,580
Who has the box?

1022
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,500
Where's the box?

1023
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,740
Guys, I don't have enough...

1024
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,620
To make a box.

1025
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,140
Oh, wait.

1026
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:43,880
The shulker box.

1027
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,460
Alright, guys.

1028
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,680
Alright, everybody.

1029
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,160
Okay.

1030
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,000
It's just all fish.

1031
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:49,680
But that's okay.

1032
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,580
That's okay.

1033
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,180
It's just fish.

1034
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,300
Let me get rid of that.

1035
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,060
Oh, my God.

1036
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,500
Let me get rid of all the fish.

1037
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,220
Okay.

1038
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,220
The shulker box is our little safety deposit box.

1039
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:01,540
Guys.

1040
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,760
Let me get rid of all...

1041
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,200
Oh, my God.

1042
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,860
Let me get rid of the fish.

1043
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,360
Alright.

1044
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,060
And then, deposit your items!

1045
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,900
Deposit your items, everybody!

1046
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,140
Weeee!

1047
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:29,530
Alright.

1048
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,090
Alright.

1049
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,770
Put it in this box, guys!

1050
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,770
Put all your-wait, can you guys not access this?

1051
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,010
Can't you guys not access... whoops, whoops.

1052
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,230
It's just, it's unclear.

1053
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,930
We can't access the box.

1054
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,950
Okay, we'll try it here.

1055
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,950
All right, we'll try it again.

1056
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,730
All right, don't worry.

1057
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,450
Okay, okay, how about this?

1058
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,410
We do sing... I believe in us.

1059
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,790
All right, I have an idea.

1060
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,090
While the staff is figuring out how to...

1061
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:20,130
how to unclaim all lands, I have an idea, everybody.

1062
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,010
Like I said, we're all doing this live.

1063
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,550
Okay, this will be...

1064
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,970
All right, you line up one by one.

1065
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:31,570
Line up in a single file and offer me the thing you want to deposit.

1066
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,450
In a single file!

1067
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,270
Single file!

1068
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,930
No, you can't be in front of me.

1069
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:39,790
You have to be...

1070
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:40,910
You can't be behind me.

1071
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,250
You have to be in front of me.

1072
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,010
Go!

1073
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:43,650
Go!

1074
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:48,350
Anyone that's behind me does not get to have a safety deposit box.

1075
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:49,150
Go behind!

1076
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,650
Go... I mean, go in front of me!

1077
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:51,810
Go in front of me!

1078
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,150
Go in front of me!

1079
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,350
Go in...

1080
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,010
Okay.

1081
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,150
In front!

1082
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,370
In front!

1083
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,290
Anyone behind me?

1084
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,410
Okay, this didn't work, guys.

1085
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:09,890
Okay!

1086
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:10,790
Okay!

1087
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,410
In front of me!

1088
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,990
In front of me!

1089
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,010
Alright!

1090
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,530
Alright!

1091
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,350
Alright!

1092
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:21,390
Alright!

1093
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:21,910
Stop!

1094
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:22,450
Stop!

1095
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,950
Okay!

1096
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:23,930
Alright!

1097
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:24,110
Alright!

1098
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,290
What do you have to offer?

1099
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,810
Okay, you don't have to move up every time!

1100
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:29,750
You don't have to move up!

1101
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,150
Just... Alright!

1102
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,390
What do you have to offer in the safety deposit box?

1103
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,630
What do you have to offer?

1104
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,110
Let me grab... kick away my fish first.

1105
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,890
Get the junk out of the way.

1106
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,830
Get the junk out.

1107
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:46,530
Alright!

1108
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:47,570
What's your offering?

1109
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,050
I'll make sure to keep it all safe.

1110
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:50,850
Very safe.

1111
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,590
Don't worry.

1112
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,910
I'll keep this very safe.

1113
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,190
Do not worry.

1114
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:58,850
I'll keep this all very, very safe for you.

1115
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,450
Do not worry.

1116
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,990
You know how I can make it extra safe?

1117
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,150
If it's on my body.

1118
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,170
Don't...

1119
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,630
Don't worry!

1120
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,410
I'll... make sure you'll have all your items back.

1121
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:15,910
Whoa!

1122
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,090
Oh my god!

1123
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,790
I got an achievement, guys.

1124
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,870
Oh my god!

1125
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:20,590
Don't worry!

1126
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,570
This is a very trusted safety deposit box.

1127
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,810
This is... This is...

1128
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,190
It will be... Alright!

1129
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:29,850
That's enough safety!

1130
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,030
I have... I have enough...

1131
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,270
Enough safety deposits.

1132
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:40,890
I... I have... I have... That's enough safety!

1133
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,330
That's... Seriously...

1134
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,130
Alright, guys.

1135
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,950
I have... That's enough safety deposit box.

1136
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,530
The bank has closed.

1137
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,210
Sorry.

1138
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,550
You gotta come back tomorrow.

1139
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,710
Oh, sorry.

1140
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:55,570
Tomorrow's Sunday.

1141
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,910
You gotta come back on Monday.

1142
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:04,830
You have to come back on Monday to access the bank.

1143
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,490
It's closing hours.

1144
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,190
We gotta go home.

1145
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,690
Alright, let me see what the mod say.

1146
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,250
We're on it?

1147
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,530
Okay, how long?

1148
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:20,810
Estimated time.

1149
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,430
Alright, SM... Oh, you guys want... Let's see the old lands.

1150
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,250
Alright, I want to tour the old relic while they're...

1151
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:34,210
While they're fixing unclaiming all lands, we're gonna check out the old lands.

1152
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,610
I think it's... How is it?

1153
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,230
I have to look through the command list.

1154
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,310
Old SMP, okay.

1155
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,670
Alright.

1156
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,930
The old lands.

1157
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,470
So, this is the old... The old lands right here.

1158
00:54:59,170 --> 00:54:59,770
Wait.

1159
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,550
Is it the old lands?

1160
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:02,650
Oh, yeah, it is!

1161
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,890
You can see all the...

1162
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,750
Old structures and everything.

1163
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,010
Look at that.

1164
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:08,910
Hello, everyone.

1165
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,270
You see everything they made back then?

1166
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,950
Relics of the past.

1167
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,550
And everything.

1168
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:17,830
And everything.

1169
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,950
Look, there's the...

1170
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,130
The fuck is that?

1171
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,710
Oh, my God.

1172
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,370
This is so cool.

1173
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,350
This is Doki Land.

1174
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:23,350
Yeah.

1175
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:24,590
This is Doki Land.

1176
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:25,390
Our seaport.

1177
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,210
The old seaport in Doki Land.

1178
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,970
That's pretty cool back then.

1179
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:34,850
Oh, my God.

1180
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,290
Look at all these builds.

1181
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:39,630
I never got a chance to see all the amazing builds you guys did in here.

1182
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,510
So, we're giving a tour while...

1183
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,670
Looking through it all.

1184
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,490
And there's the...

1185
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,930
The Oshi mark right here.

1186
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,730
We're at number one.

1187
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,970
She was number...

1188
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,830
Oh, there's a drag horn on top of it, too!

1189
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,660
Can we set daytime?

1190
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,780
I don't think I'm allowed to.

1191
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,080
I don't think I'm allowed to set the daytime.

1192
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,320
And then...

1193
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,160
There's that.

1194
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,560
Oh, there's an airship.

1195
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,860
That's so cool.

1196
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,980
There is an airship.

1197
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,060
And everything, too.

1198
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,200
Oh, my God.

1199
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:21,860
There's...

1200
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:25,380
There's Hatsune Miku.

1201
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,390
There's Hatsune...

1202
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,380
He has no power here.

1203
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,160
Is the time set?

1204
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,340
Time set.

1205
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,800
I don't think I'm allowed to.

1206
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,020
Day...

1207
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,000
Set...

1208
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,320
Set...

1209
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:38,940
No.

1210
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,360
Time...

1211
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,000
Add...

1212
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,140
I don't know.

1213
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,180
Three...

1214
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,560
Days.

1215
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,180
Days.

1216
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:52,980
Seconds.

1217
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,960
Three seconds.

1218
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,320
Oh, shit.

1219
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:56,880
I did it.

1220
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:57,600
Oh, wait.

1221
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,480
Oh, I...

1222
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,460
Silent Croaky did it.

1223
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,660
I thought I did it.

1224
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,580
I was like, Whoa!

1225
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,640
But it was Silent Croaky.

1226
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,140
It was...

1227
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,660
Oh, there's the...

1228
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:09,980
Oh, my God.

1229
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,160
There's Squidward's house.

1230
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,200
Wait, someone made Squidward's house?

1231
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,240
That's so cool.

1232
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:15,960
That's...

1233
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,060
Okay.

1234
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,500
Wait, is that the prison?

1235
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,200
Wait, I think this was a...

1236
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,020
I was like, Whoa!

1237
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,020
I did it!

1238
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
And then I was like, Oh...

1239
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:30,780
Oh...

1240
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,440
I didn't do it.

1241
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,070
No, no, no, no.

1242
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,830
Wipe everybody's inventories.

1243
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:41,970
Wipe everyone's...

1244
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,510
Inventory.

1245
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:45,670
But mine.

1246
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,330
But mine.

1247
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,690
But mine.

1248
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,150
Mine is the most important.

1249
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:09,950
Wait, let me make sure.

1250
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,170
I'm gonna message that to the mods right now.

1251
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,330
To make sure they get that...

1252
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,890
No, I am a...

1253
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,530
I am the safety deposit.

1254
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:20,250
That's right.

1255
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:20,670
Don't keep throwing the horse.

1256
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,250
For an evil ink.

1257
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,370
Okay, I'm not evil.

1258
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:34,110
I'm just... it's just really hard to be a ruler, okay?

1259
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,850
You gotta make sacrifices.

1260
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:37,330
Okay, guys.

1261
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:44,210
You gotta... you gotta make sacrifices for what's right.

1262
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,990
For the land.

1263
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,230
Oh, hey, Kroki.

1264
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,610
Ah!

1265
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,250
Okay.

1266
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,350
What else is there?

1267
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,170
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1268
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,970
Oh, there's bunnies.

1269
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,210
I thought it says Benny.

1270
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,470
Oh my god, there's a Benny's here?

1271
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:06,750
There's a...

1272
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,290
Whoa, oh my god!

1273
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:09,610
That's so cool!

1274
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,310
There's like a creed!

1275
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,830
This is actually the port!

1276
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,310
Toki Land port!

1277
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,570
Oh my god!

1278
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:16,690
There's a fucking...

1279
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,630
There's just a giant ship!

1280
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,610
There's a Denny's here?

1281
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,070
Oh my god, this place has everything!

1282
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,590
There's a Denny's here at Toki Land!

1283
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:26,710
There's a...

1284
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:26,830
Whoa!

1285
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,060
Alright, don't worry.

1286
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,260
We can rebuild and make it even better.

1287
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,640
See, what else is there?

1288
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,940
I'm like flying so...

1289
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,180
Alright, wait, actually let me...

1290
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,230
Wipe everyone's...

1291
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,920
Wipe everyone's...

1292
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,270
Inventory...

1293
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,680
But...

1294
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:48,820
Mine!

1295
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,960
I'm about to message that.

1296
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:57,960
Don't worry.

1297
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:58,980
Don't they know now?

1298
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,600
Oh, and then there's the...

1299
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,200
All the...

1300
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:01,760
Chips...

1301
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,080
At Doki Land.

1302
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,360
The seaport.

1303
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:05,900
We're...

1304
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,480
Oh my god.

1305
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,680
Our trading station...

1306
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,460
Our trading ports.

1307
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,480
We are very...

1308
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,180
We are very rich in resources and trade.

1309
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,270
White Toki...

1310
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:19,450
No!

1311
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,550
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1312
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,650
No, no, no, no, no.

1313
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,010
The Dragoons has depended on me.

1314
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,510
On being a safety deposit box.

1315
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:27,870
Uh...

1316
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:29,550
Hahaha....

1317
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,710
There's uh...

1318
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,210
Doki drinks.

1319
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,310
Oh, that's cool.

1320
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:36,070
Alright.

1321
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,130
Oh, there's a lighthouse, too!

1322
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,670
Oh, that's so cool.

1323
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,350
There's a lighthouse...

1324
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,010
And everything.

1325
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,030
What else in there?

1326
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,630
Oh, there's apparently a shopping district?

1327
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,600
No, no, no.

1328
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:51,940
I...

1329
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1330
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,480
Doki bank will survive.

1331
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,580
Will survive the great wife.

1332
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,340
Server is lagging.

1333
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,820
Oh, maybe they're trying to wipe everything right now.

1334
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,120
Is this a shopping district?

1335
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,940
Okay, no, that's not.

1336
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,120
This is the Toki Salute.

1337
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,540
This is an actual town.

1338
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,260
All right.

1339
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,160
No, no, no, no, no.

1340
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,240
We are... we have been around for generations.

1341
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,120
Your families have always depended on us.

1342
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,600
Yeah, there's so many cool things.

1343
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,260
You need to teleport to them.

1344
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,180
How do I accept?

1345
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,520
I don't... Oh, there it is.

1346
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,180
What is this?

1347
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,840
Where is this area?

1348
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,500
Is this a shopping mall?

1349
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,780
Oh my god.

1350
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:46,540
Wait.

1351
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,260
Was this a shopping mall?

1352
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,040
What is this?

1353
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,700
Oh my god, wait.

1354
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,980
What the fuck is this?

1355
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,720
What was this?

1356
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,080
It's a capitol building?

1357
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,880
Oh my god, is this my white house?

1358
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,060
Is this...

1359
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,940
Oh my god.

1360
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,640
Is this my white house?

1361
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,840
It's an island.

1362
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,420
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1363
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,900
Oh my god, guys.

1364
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,480
It's my white house.

1365
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,700
Right there.

1366
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:21,680
The Toki house.

1367
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,040
Yeah.

1368
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,460
I was gonna say, make it yellow.

1369
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,400
The yellow house.

1370
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:31,720
Alright.

1371
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,100
What else is there?

1372
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,840
Alright, if you guys wanted me to see your builds in the...

1373
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,420
Um, the old town.

1374
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,300
Just...

1375
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,000
Let me TP to you.

1376
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,340
Oh my god, I'm loading everything in right now.

1377
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:45,660
Alright.

1378
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,700
I'll TP to you.

1379
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:49,620
Alright, what is this?

1380
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,860
Pathway to the shopping district.

1381
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:52,280
Oh.

1382
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,840
Read before entering.

1383
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:55,320
No.

1384
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,480
I refuse.

1385
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,340
Wait, what?

1386
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,540
How do we enter the shopping district?

1387
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,000
How...

1388
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,860
Oh, the voice chat mod is not working?

1389
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,280
Don't worry.

1390
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,100
We'll fix that.

1391
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,380
We'll fix that in post.

1392
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,640
The reason why...

1393
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:09,920
Oh wait.

1394
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,620
We had a decision to either...

1395
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,080
Um...

1396
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:18,380
Okay, we had the decision to either, uh...

1397
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,080
Do...

1398
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,500
Um...

1399
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,200
Let members in early and then figure it out before the stream starts.

1400
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,320
Or...

1401
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,580
Wait, what does this say?

1402
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,400
Now entering the hallway to Electric Boogaloo.

1403
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,680
No, no.

1404
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,340
This is actual throwback.

1405
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,940
Oh my god.

1406
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,180
This is fucking throwback.

1407
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:40,960
The things...

1408
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,000
The sins I've committed.

1409
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,080
Uh...

1410
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,040
But then I was like...

1411
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,500
I feel like it would have been more fun.

1412
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,560
I don't know.

1413
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,020
I feel like it'd be more fun to...

1414
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:49,420
Oh my god.

1415
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,720
There's like a sea view too.

1416
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:07,920
Uh...

1417
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,180
If you wanna shop, you gotta go through the doors.

1418
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,160
Oh my...

1419
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,060
I'm still going.

1420
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:14,880
Uh...

1421
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,980
Oh wait, it's pink now.

1422
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:16,480
At least.

1423
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,440
Oh, it's pink.

1424
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,920
Okay, and then it's back to yellow.

1425
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,600
Wait, what was I talking about?

1426
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:22,980
Oh yeah.

1427
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,860
We had to do it live.

1428
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,120
I decided to do it live.

1429
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,160
Because I felt like it's a more fun experience for everybody.

1430
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,860
If we all like...

1431
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,720
Experience it together.

1432
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,040
Rather than having the members like, you know...

1433
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,920
Getting in there first and start claiming stuff.

1434
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,360
I felt like it'd be better if we were all there together at the same time.

1435
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,120
That would drive someone insane.

1436
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:42,680
This is...

1437
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,080
This is actually impressive.

1438
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:45,860
I...

1439
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,500
That was my very first build.

1440
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:48,300
This is...

1441
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,360
My...

1442
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,660
I did...

1443
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:51,680
I did like...

1444
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,120
If you guys ever see my very...

1445
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:53,840
My...

1446
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,320
Very first Minecraft stream.

1447
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,560
This is basically what I did.

1448
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,340
As my very first Minecraft stream.

1449
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,340
But like...

1450
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:02,420
They took that concept.

1451
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:03,820
And...

1452
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,360
Uh...

1453
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,240
They...

1454
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,000
Uh...

1455
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,440
They took that concept.

1456
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,760
And like...

1457
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,440
Did me like...

1458
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,120
Times a hundred.

1459
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,100
Uh...

1460
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,180
Why though?

1461
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:17,590
Because...

1462
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,620
I thought it was funny.

1463
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,660
I thought it was really funny.

1464
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,820
And I was right.

1465
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:23,900
I...

1466
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:25,960
I...

1467
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,060
Yeah, they expanded it a little bit.

1468
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:29,140
They...

1469
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:30,140
They...

1470
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,320
They...

1471
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:32,700
It...

1472
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,020
It...

1473
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,660
It was funny.

1474
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,580
It was worth it.

1475
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,260
Okay.

1476
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,020
Alright.

1477
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,600
Oh my god!

1478
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,700
Where does it end?

1479
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,000
Where does it actually end?

1480
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,760
Where does it end?

1481
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:46,780
Oh my god!

1482
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,840
Is this where it ends?

1483
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,120
Oh my god!

1484
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,060
It's still going...

1485
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:50,640
I...

1486
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,620
I can't find the ending.

1487
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:52,700
I...

1488
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,640
I can't...

1489
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,200
Oh my god!

1490
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,280
Oh my god!

1491
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:57,920
It...

1492
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,320
It actually doesn't end!

1493
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,780
I'm so...

1494
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,300
Walk...

1495
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:02,520
I'm...

1496
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,120
It's still going on!

1497
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,400
Holy...

1498
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,200
Does it end here?

1499
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,260
Oh my god!

1500
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:07,780
Is that the end?

1501
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,840
I can't tell.

1502
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:10,860
Wait...

1503
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:11,320
Where did...

1504
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:11,800
Where did...

1505
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,340
Oh my god!

1506
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,260
Where did it go?

1507
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,260
Oh my god!

1508
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:14,880
I just...

1509
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,120
Okay!

1510
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,560
It's still going...

1511
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:16,680
Guys!

1512
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:16,920
Okay!

1513
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,780
I will go back to the world when I find the ending of this.

1514
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,380
I...

1515
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:20,700
I...

1516
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,800
Does it end?

1517
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,060
It should end, right?

1518
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,020
Oh my god!

1519
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:26,440
Okay!

1520
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:26,640
Okay!

1521
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,320
Wait!

1522
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:28,960
There is still going on!

1523
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,220
It's still...

1524
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,520
Oh my god!

1525
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:34,640
I'm still...

1526
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,440
But wait!

1527
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,700
There's more!

1528
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,140
But wait!

1529
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,100
I don't know!

1530
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,720
There's...

1531
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,820
There's more!

1532
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,040
Oh my god!

1533
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,360
Guys, I think they expanded my concept just...

1534
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,320
Just a bit more than my old one.

1535
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,600
They need...

1536
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,360
Make sure you can't dig out.

1537
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:56,860
Like...

1538
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:57,760
How...

1539
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,140
How far does it go?

1540
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,240
I need to see the ending.

1541
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:00,880
I...

1542
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,640
I have to see the ending of this.

1543
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:03,180
Like...

1544
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,480
Did they just do this every day?

1545
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,860
This was their job!

1546
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:06,680
They...

1547
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,300
They log in!

1548
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,000
They log in and just do this.

1549
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,260
9...

1550
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,820
This was their 9 to 5...

1551
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,960
Every day until the server shut down.

1552
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,020
Like...

1553
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,300
They were too committed now.

1554
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,880
This was their 9 to 5.

1555
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:25,860
I'm...

1556
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,500
Oh my god!

1557
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,220
There's the ending!

1558
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,040
Guys!

1559
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,880
It's here!

1560
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,920
We made it!

1561
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,380
We actually...

1562
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,480
We visited again!

1563
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,780
Called generally the worst thing I've ever been through...

1564
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,540
In Minecraft...

1565
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,540
Was funny for...

1566
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,820
A bit...

1567
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:53,720
The...

1568
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,100
The tunnel...

1569
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,280
That's actually crazy!

1570
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:01,860
You...

1571
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,580
Oh my god!

1572
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,600
How did I miss something?

1573
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,360
I went through so much!

1574
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,760
Well...

1575
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,460
Why...

1576
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,660
But I should have asked!

1577
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,460
What would I have missed?

1578
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,780
I went through this entire tunnel!

1579
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,140
Okay, there's the shopping...

1580
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:29,540
Are we...

1581
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,100
Are we here?

1582
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,300
Are we in the shopping district now?

1583
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,560
Is this the...

1584
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,340
Is this the...

1585
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,160
Is this the...

1586
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:38,520
Mall?

1587
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,040
Is this the mall?

1588
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,460

You gotta pay me for that!

1609
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,460
Oh, we can't press...

1610
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,580
We can't play it!

1611
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:35,520
No!

1612
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,340
No, you don't get that ad!

1613
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,480
You gotta pay me if you want ad space!

1614

No, it's not getting wiped!

1615

You can, like...

1616
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,540
Revisit the ancient area!

1617
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:48,880
Oh my god!

1618
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,540
There's a billboard and everything!

1619
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,520
The Doki Mall!

1620
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,020
Oh my god!

1621
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,880
There's a fast food restaurant here!

1622
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,140
That's crazy!

1623
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:56,980
Oh my god!

1624
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,980
Should you ignore the full netherite beacon?

1625
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:02,860
That's not important!

1626
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:03,920
That's...

1627
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,160
Alright, alright!

1628
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,880
We go back to...

1629
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:11,920
Uh...

1630
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,280
How was the command again?

1631
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,160
Oh, by the way!

They've been waiting for me!

1640
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,580
Alright, I'm back!

1641
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:32,960

1642
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,940

1643
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:35,680
I...

1644
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,820
Wait, why am I still a ghost?

1645
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,240
Wait, why am I...

1646
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,560
Why am I...

1647
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,180
A ghost?

1648
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:44,920
Oh...

1649
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:46,700
Um...

1650
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,380
Uh...

1651
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,860
That's awkward!

1652
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:49,960
Wait, no!

1653
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,000
This is still the old area!

1654
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:51,980
Wait, how do I...

1655
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,380

1659
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,260
There we go!

1660
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,100

01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:57,520
SMP!

1662
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:58,840

Alright!

1664
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,160
Wipe their inventory!

1665
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,100
I still see people...

1666
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,760
Did everybody's inventory got wiped?

1667
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,480
No, cause I still see diamond pickaxes!

1668
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:09,920

1669
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,000

Ha ha ha ha!

1671
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,400
Oh!

1672
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,140
Excluding one person takes a bit!

1673
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,000
Ha ha ha ha!

1674
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,140
Oh, they're slowly wiping everybody's...

1675
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:21,520
Good!

1676
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,460
Good!

1677
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,780
Slowly wipe everybody's inventory!

1678
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:25,940
Uh...

1679
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:26,360
Ha ha ha!

1680
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,400
No, it's okay, there!

1681
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,160
They're doing it one by one!

1682
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,340
They're do...

1683
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:31,160
Ha ha ha ha!

1684
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,420
That's so fucked up!

1685
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,720
Wait, where's my feather?

1686
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,960
What is...

1687
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,820
That's so fucked up!

1688
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,600
I like it!

1689
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,660
Alright, selection tool...

1690
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,560
Wait, I lost my feather...

1691
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,180
Oh, there it is!

1692
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:44,420
Nice!

1693
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,200
Alright!

1694
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,260
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1695
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,300
Yes!

1696
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,840

1699
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,640
I'll get my land back...

1700
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:04,380
Just to inflict more pain...

1701
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,520
Ha ha ha ha!

1702
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,140
Ha ha ha ha!

1703
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,380
Oh, only I can claim land!

1704
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:10,960
Yes!

1705
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,180
Ha ha ha!

1706
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,000
I claim my land first!

1707
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,240
I need to get my...

1708
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:16,860
My hill!

1709
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,520
Everything the sun touches is mine!

1710
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,840
Wait, okay, after I...

1711
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,320
Okay, but we're...

1712
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,780
Give me the teleport coordination of the very important thing!

01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,560
I'm not doing that!

1714
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,000
I'm not doing that again!

1715
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,500
I'm not going through the hallway again to find it!

1716
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,620
Ha ha ha!

1717
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:40,520
Alright!

1718
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:42,220
Okay!

Are you serious?

1720
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,360
Who claimed this land?

1721
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,020
Who claimed it already?!

1722
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,000
Wipe this area!

1723
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,520

Okay.

1742
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,290
Has it been removed?

1743
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:32,250
Yes!

1744
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:41,130

I got TP'd somewhere.

1755
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:02,850
No, this is not the hill.

1756
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:03,830

1757
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,630
This is not my hill.

01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,440
I don't know, it's a plug-in that was programmed.

1821
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,400
Okay.

1822
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:28,900
I can't claim land because I am a member of Journey.

1823
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,400
What's wrong with that?

1824
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:36,880
I claim.

1825
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,300
Okay.

1826
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,820
Slash claim.

1827
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,640
Oh my god.

1828
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,960
I claim... Shoot him!

1829
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,240
Transfer your land to me right now.

1830
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,980
Mod, make him transfer his land to me.

1831
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:05,980
Okay, wait.

1832
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:14,660
Forrest, transfer... Forrest... Transfer his land to me.

1833
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:30,770
Forrest, transfer his... This is the perfect song to play, too, while we're doing this.

1834
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,910
This is the dookie games right now.

1835
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,480
I'm waiting.

1836
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:50,740
I'm waiting until... Until the mod... Forrest, transfer this land back to me.

1837
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:51,820
Take his land!

1838
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,910
That's what you get for taking dookie land.

1839
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:03,930
Okay, I gotta get rid of the... What's the setting for that?

1840
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,930
The... That shows the... All the stuff on my far right?

1841
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:10,030
I don't remember.

1842
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,150
Is this accessibility?

1843
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,370
Which one was that?

1844
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,470
I'll get rid of that.

1845
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,550
Is it subtitles?

1846
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,190
Oh, there you go.

1847
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:19,750
Subtitles.

1848
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:20,290
There you go.

1849
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:24,610
Okay, he's trying.

1850
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:25,630
Okay, I believe.

1851
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:27,010
He's trying right now.

1852
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:33,610
He's trying.

1853
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:37,150
Okay.

1854
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:37,330
All right.

1855
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,270
Oh, wait.

1856
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:40,430
It's the wilderness now.

1857
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:42,410
Wait!

1858
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:43,550
Wait, it's the wilderness!

1859
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:44,310
Yes!

1860
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:51,820
No!

1861
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:52,840
Drop!

1862
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,340
Slash claim.

1863
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,360
Did I do it?

1864
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,460
I claimed one ch... I only got one chunk?!

1865
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:03,810
Oh my god, I only got one chunk.

1866
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,490
I only got one chunk.

1867
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,910
Slash claim.

1868
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,350

1870
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:13,410
Where's my land?

1871
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:14,430
I can't tell.

1872
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:15,750
Who owns this land?

1873
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,170
Who owns...

1874
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,160
Okay, yeah, make it...

1875
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,200
Make it land.

1876
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,140
Make the...

1877
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,500

1878
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,580
Okay, make the...

1879
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,720
Make it day.

1880
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,560
Make it day, guys.

1881
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:41,540
Oh, don't...

1882
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,740
Oh, I did it!

1883
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,520
I claimed my land!

1884
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,820
Alright, take this guy's land, too.

1885
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,580
Wait, did I do it?

1886
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,280
Did I do it?

1887
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,300
This is mine, right?

1888
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,640
How far...

1889
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,580
How far is my land?

1890
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,280
How far is it?

1891
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,420
I don't know how far it is.

1892
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,440
Okay, just claim more.

1893
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:02,780
Okay.

Selection is not...

Please make selection by land selection.

1900
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:15,040
Okay.

01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:19,960
Oh.

01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:21,440
Alright.

1905
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:27,850
Okay.

My land.

1909
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:34,910
The Ender Dragon's dead again.

1910
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:36,770

1911
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:37,510

1912
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,550

1914
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:42,950

1915
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:45,790
Okay.

1916
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,370
I don't remember my commands.

1917
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,890
I'm like, all over the place.

1918
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:51,350
Oh, it's claim.

1919
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:52,190
It's claim.

1920
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,130
Okay.

1921
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,190
Okay.

Claim.

1923
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,630
Should I have scissors?

1924
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,690
You can claim this by executing...

1925
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:08,730
Oh.

1926
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:10,370

1930
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:15,630

1931
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:16,130
Selection.

1932
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:19,630
Oh, shit.

1933
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:20,390
I...

1934
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:24,750
I'm so confused.

1935
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:29,150
Guys, it's been so long.

1936
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:31,530
Okay.

1937
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:32,370
Slash claim.

1938
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:34,990
Wait.

1939
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:35,270
What?

1940
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:36,450
This is my land.

1941
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:38,230
Who...

1942
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:39,130
Who owns this area?

1943
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:40,590
Oh, wait.

1944
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:41,230
I got everything.

1945
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:41,930
Okay.

1946
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:42,670
But it's so tiny.

1947
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:42,990
Okay.

1948
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:43,770
I gotta claim more.

1949
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,630
I gotta claim more.

1950
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:50,110
Slash...

1951
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:50,590
Claim.

1952
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:52,110
Wait.

1953
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:52,410
What?

1954
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,240
Wait.

1955
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,100
Who claimed this?

1956
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:00,860
Take this...

1957
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,220
Transfer this land to my land.

1958
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,480
Guys.

1959
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,340
Mod.

1960
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,220
Take this land back.

1961
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,220
Force transfer this guy's land to me.

1962
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:13,820
Right now, Mod.

1963
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,060
I'll give the name.

1964
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,600
AJ.

1965
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:19,220
Okay.

1966
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,720
AJ.

1967
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:21,880
Hey.

1968
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,400
Force...

1969
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,880
Force...

1970
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:26,960
Force...

1971
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,620
Transfer...

1972
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:30,000
This land over right now.

1973
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,140
Force...

1974
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:36,080
Transfer...

1975
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:36,980
Their land.

1976
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,520
Their land to me.

1977
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:41,520
Right.

1978
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:41,520
Wait.

1979
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:49,560
I demand this land to be my land.

1980
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,720
My Kamiyoshi is stealing land.

1981
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,180
The British are coming.

1982
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,380
Oh, they can't because... Oh, sorry.

1983
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,040
Too soon?

1984
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,180
They actually can't, though.

1985
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,560
That's a bit too soon.

1986
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:15,480
This land is my land.

1987
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,500
Alright.

1988
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,060
What's his name?

1989
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,580
AJ.

1990
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,160
I have the unclaimed land for you in Fixed Inventory.

1991
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,260
Not the laws.

1992
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,660
The keys are going to tear.

1993
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,640
It's getting so bad.

1994
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:49,140
The ended dragon hat and an aneurysm will freaking die.

1995
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,100
Okay, don't worry.

1996
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,620
I have your name now.

1997
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:54,180
Every land you claim will belong to me.

1998
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:58,540
How dare you take my mountain, is his name.

1999
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,680
I wrote your name down.

2000
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:03,560
It's too late.

2001
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,760
Your entire land will be mine.

2002
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,040
That's right.

2003
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,260
I have an eviction law.

2004
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:18,920
Wait.

2005
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:19,260
What happened?

2006
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:19,540
Okay.

2007
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,200
Oh my god, it's gone.

2008
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:25,570
Oh my god.

2009
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:28,350
Okay.

2010
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:29,610
Damn.

2011
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:31,630
Wait, what?

2012
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:33,090
But it said wilderness.

2013
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:37,550
What is the wilderness?

2014
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:41,530
Okay.

2015
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,670
I'm gonna claim as much as I can.

2016
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:48,690
That's fucking right.

2017
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:51,110
I'm gonna claim as much as I can.

2018
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:52,610
Claim.

2019
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:54,710
Alright.

2020
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:57,930
I'll figure this out.

2021
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:59,530
I'll figure this out.

2022
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:01,070
Claim.

2023
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:03,570
Alright.

2024
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:05,790
Bro, who stole my land?

2025
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:13,250
Claim.

2026
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:18,790
Alright.

2027
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,250
Claim.

2028
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:22,170
Claim.

2029
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:25,030
Oh, I claimed seven.

2030
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:25,550
Oh!

2031
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:26,530
I claimed seven!

2032
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:27,250
Okay.

2033
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:28,530
Okay.

2034
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:29,710
I got seven land.

2035
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:31,270
Okay.

2036
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:32,170
I think...

2037
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:33,170
What else is mine?

2038
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,510
Is this also mine?

2039
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:35,570
Okay.

2040
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:35,890
Wait, wait.

2041
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:36,750
I figured it out.

2042
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,530
Guys, I figured it out.

2043
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:44,890
Claim.

2044
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:47,310
I claimed three more chunks!

2045
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:48,770
Don't get land!

2046
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,710
Did I do it?

2047
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:55,590
That's right!

2048
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,090
I got my land back!

2049
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:59,250
You whore!

2050
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:00,430
I got it back!

2051
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:03,010
That's fucking right!

2052
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,390
You can't claim shit!

2053
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,070
Claiming more.

2054
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:11,390
The fuck?

2055
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,730
Who fucking sent the wizard?

2056
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:15,390
That's right!

2057
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,510
It's all mine now!

2058
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:18,590
That's fucking right!

2059
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:20,090
It unclaimed your land!

2060
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,270
That's right!

2061
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,110
It unclaimed your land!

2062
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:24,630
That's right!

2063
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:25,130
Where is he?

2064
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,030
Where is he?

2065
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:26,910
I need a...

2066
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:28,470
Now kick him out of my...

2067
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:28,910
No, I'm serious.

2068
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:29,390
Joking.

2069
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,710
I'm joking.

2070
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:33,650
Don't kick him out of my... Yeah, that's looking right!

2071
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:34,710
That's right!

2072
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:35,730
That's right!

2073
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,170
Wait, this is my area.

2074
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,430
Why can't I kill him in my own land?

2075
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:45,870
I should be allowed to kill someone on my own land.

2076
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,030
That's right.

2077
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:55,130
I told you your land will be my land.

2078
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:56,630
I told you.

2079
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:57,970
I... Shit.

2080
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:01,870
Where is he?

2081
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,910
Oh, there he is.

2082
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:04,170
Who the fuck summoned him?

2083
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:11,410
This is my... Why is there... Guys, kill him!

2084
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:12,730
Oh, yeah.

2085
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:14,110
You guys don't have inventory anymore.

2086
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:14,790
Only I do.

2087
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:20,070
Okay, wait.

2088
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:20,350
Wow.

2089
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,170
Guys, guys, figure out the wither.

2090
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:24,470
I'm gonna... I'm gonna rename my land.

2091
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:26,070
What's the command?

2092
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,570
Give me a sec.

2093
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:29,190
How do I rename land again, guys?

2094
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:30,170
What's the command?

2095
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:33,090
Save.

2096
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:33,990
What?

2097
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,590
That's someone else.

2098
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:37,670
I believe in you guys.

2099
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:39,850
I believe in you guys.

2100
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:41,470
Oh, shit.

2101
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:41,910
Wait.

2102
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:42,550
He's hitting me.

2103
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:42,990
Wait.

2104
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:44,250
That's not supposed to happen.

2105
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:46,030
Wait.

2106
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:47,310
That's not supposed to happen.

2107
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:50,290
Who the fuck still had the wither shit on them?

2108
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:52,530
It's okay.

2109
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:53,590
I'll fly over here.

2110
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:57,390
I don't know.

2111
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:58,370
It's alright.

2112
01:27:58,650 --> 01:27:59,210
There's Germany.

2113
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,500
Alright.

2114
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,560
Let me read this real quick, guys.

2115
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,580
Let me read the instructions real quick.

2116
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:11,620
Alright.

2117
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,080
Okay.

2118
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,100
Set home.

2119
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,000
Okay.

2120
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,340
We gotta set home for that.

2121
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:17,620
Set home.

2122
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:18,880
And then...

2123
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,540
Lands rename.

2124
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,100
Okay.

2125
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,080
Lands rename.

2126
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:24,540
Okay.

2127
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,820
We gotta go back.

2128
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,380
I think that's where...

2129
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:27,480
Yeah.

2130
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,120
We gotta go back.

2131
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:31,900
Alright.

2132
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,100
We figured this out.

2133
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,940
We're slowly learning how to play again.

2134
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:39,880
Okay.

2135
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,320
He's, like, almost dead.

2136
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:42,120
Guys.

2137
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:42,860
I swear to God.

2138
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,660
If I come back and my hill is gone.

2139
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,780
I swear to God.

2140
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,020
Wait.

2141
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,880
Croaky, can you, like, kill him for us real quick?

2142
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:53,560
Can you...

2143
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:01,240
Say home.

2144
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,120
Yeah.

2145
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:03,440
Alright.

2146
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,860
And then...

2147
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,140
Uh...

2148
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:07,800
Okay.

2149
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,320
Save us prokey.

2150
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,340
Lands rename.

2151
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:13,200
Okay.

2152
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:14,880
Alright.

2153
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:16,660
And then...

2154
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,320
Joke me lands.

2155
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,440
Wait, who took TokiLand?

2156
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:34,950
Mon, unnamed that man's land right now.

2157
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:38,970
Who copyright patented TokiLand before I could?

2158
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:46,330
Mon, un-copyright claims, un-trademarked right now.

2159
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:51,810
Yoink.

2160
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:53,710
Also, make it daytime.

2161
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:55,870
Make it daytime.

2162
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:58,850
Wait, why can you build on my land?

2163
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:02,010
This is... Oh wait, that's just the one area that's not mine.

2164
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:04,990
Until now.

2165
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:14,700
That's right.

2166
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,780
It's my land now.

2167
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,460
I own this now.

2168
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,880
That's right.

2169
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,280
I own it now.

2170
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,780
I can't do anything.

2171
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:26,900
Jump!

2172
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:27,960
Jump!

2173
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,600
That's okay, right?

2174
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:36,860
Jump!

2175
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,380
It's my land now.

2176
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,060
Okay.

2177
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,340
Alright.

2178
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:50,760
Okay, un-claim... un-trademark... un-trademark that name.

2179
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:54,680
Am I watching Lord of the Flies?

2180
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,260
Alright, this is all mine.

2181
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,120
Everything the sun touches is mine now.

2182
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:03,960
Alright.

2183
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:06,520
Claim.

2184
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:07,960
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2185
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,720
Okay, delete.

2186
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:14,420
Alright.

2187
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:15,680
Oh my god!

2188
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:17,720
I can un-claim other people's lands!

2189
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,380
And then...

2190
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,200
They just...

2191
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:27,860
I can un-claim other people's lands, and then claim them as my own!

2192
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,060
Oh my god!

2193
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,580
Goodbye, Germany!

2194
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,880
Good- I can't stop!

2195
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:41,520
I can't- I can't- I can't- Where's Germany?

2196
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,620
Which has too much power.

2197
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,040
Oh, jeez.

2198
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,600
Wait, this is a lot for my land.

2199
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,300
What the fuck?

2200
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,740
How did I got land all the way here?

2201
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,160
Wait, wait, what the fuck?

2202
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,580
How did I have land here?

2203
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,580
She's becoming a tyrant.

2204
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,300
Wait, why do I have land all the way here?

2205
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:12,900
Holy shit.

2206
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,040
Oh, shit!

2207
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,980
Go back, go back!

2208
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,460
I gotta go back.

2209
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,580
I claimed too much.

2210
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:27,880
I claimed too... Okay, this is a bit too much land now.

2211
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,840
I stole this crafting.

2212
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:33,260
Guys, I have too much land now.

2213
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,900
Okay, let's unclaim a bit some stuff.

2214
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:41,280
This is too much land.

2215
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,400
Unclaim.

2216
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:46,740
Okay.

2217
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:47,420
Oh.

2218
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:51,420
Okay.

2219
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:52,960
It's fine.

2220
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:53,820
I have my land.

2221
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,760
I'm back on my land.

2222
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,500
You can't do shit.

2223
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:56,360
That's right.

2224
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,580
You can't do shit on my land.

2225
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,620
That's fucking right.

2226
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:00,820
That's fucking... Why do I have land?

2227
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,940
Guys, you see that?

2228
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,120
I have land right there.

2229
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:07,060
This random patch of land.

2230
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:08,620
Right there.

2231
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,960
I have to clean this man's crafting table.

2232
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:13,480
I was like, wait a minute.

2233
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,960
When do I have... Okay, let's get rid of this.

2234
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,400
Unclaim.

2235
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:19,340
Okay.

2236
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,940
Yeah, I was like, this is like...

2237
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:23,620
I don't need that.

2238
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:26,720
Because you tried to claim Germany.

2239
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,220
I was like, I don't need that land.

2240
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,460
Guys, you're like flies to me.

2241
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,160
You do nothing.

2242
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:35,840
Yeah, it's like...

2243
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,260
It's like silly.

2244
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,080
You actually do nothing to me.

2245
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:43,240
All right, here we go.

2246
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:46,500
This is what Green does.

2247
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,160
Look at that.

2248
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:50,560
All right.

2249
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:51,740
Okay, wait.

2250
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,580
Um...

2251
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,880
Remove...

2252
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,450
Whoever...

2253
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:58,640
Is...

2254
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,500
Doki-land.

2255
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,640
Yeah.

2256
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,240
Un...

2257
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,800
I want that name back.

2258
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:20,040
I'm copyright striking them.

2259
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,920
I'm gonna copyright strike them.

2260
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,780
Yeah, land name.

2261
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,860
I'm copyright striking them.

2262
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,680
That's right.

2263
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,000
I copyright claim my name back.

2264
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,160
That's fucking right.

2265
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,100
It's mine.

2266
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,040
Also, I hope the sound has been okay so far.

2267
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,500
Let me check in the tab.

2268
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:52,120
That's right.

2269
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:53,140
We're fighting.

2270
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,260
Also, also, tell me who did it.

2271
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,460
Tell me who did it.

2272
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,620
I'm sending a DMCA.

2273
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,160
Donkey land is my land.

2274
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,260
That's right.

2275
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:13,340
I'm gonna send a DMCA.

2276
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:18,360
She's so struck with power.

2277
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:19,860
That's fucking right.

2278
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,840
I'll find you.

2279
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,780
I'll fucking find you.

2280
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,700
Donkey cannot be so eerie, actually.

2281
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,300
Also, sound guy.

2282
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:38,320
How's the sound so far?

2283
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,360
I want to make sure everybody can hear my plans.

2284
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:50,400
Why even bother giving people the option to claim mad land when you're just gonna claim...

2285
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,820
No, I am... No, no, no.

2286
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:52,480
That's not true.

2287
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:56,340
I'm giving them the privilege to build around my land.

2288
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,580
I'm giving them the privilege to build on my land.

2289
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,800
Guys, that's not true.

2290
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,620
I am a just ruler.

2291
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,440
I... I... I...

2292
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,160
They get the privilege to be here.

2293
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,340
I... That's how it works.

2294
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,600
I'm leasing it out.

2295
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,940
I'm leasing it out to everyone.

2296
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,760
That's right.

2297
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:37,490
The land tastes better when they used to belong to someone.

2298
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:39,170
Wait, who owns this area?

2299
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,630
Unclaimed!

2300
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:44,490
Did they actually build anything yet?

2301
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:45,790
Oh, they did!

2302
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:48,330
What if- what if I just unclaimed?

2303
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:53,650
I won't.

2304
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:55,010
No, not yet.

2305
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:57,270
Not- not yet.

2306
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:01,670
That'd be so messed up.

2307
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:04,670
Yoink, my land now.

2308
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:07,310
His home, my home.

2309
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:13,250
I'll let him live here for a little bit.

2310
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:23,490
Now that you spent several thousand dollars on a Minecraft server, you deserve a little power trip as exactly- exactly has spent money on this.

2311
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:25,930
I deserve- I deserve this.

2312
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:31,910
I'll let them develop the land a little bit before the government comes back to claim it.

2313
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,420
You know, the right way, you know?

2314
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,740
The- the- The usual way.

2315
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:45,140
You know?

2316
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,040
You know?

2317
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,240
Too real!

2318
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:54,620
Dude, I'm just waiting for- I'm just waiting until I can claim Doki land back.

2319
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,020
My best destiny, their ass.

2320
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,500
No, it's just the usual.

2321
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:03,720
Alright, I cannot get it.

2322
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,560
Oh yeah, I forgot.

2323
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,000
Okay.

2324
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:07,300
Someone give me a box real quick.

2325
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:14,000
Someone- Someone make me a- Someone give me a box, just a regular chest.

2326
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,340
I need a chest now.

2327
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,060
I need a chest- I forgot.

2328
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:18,700
My taxes.

2329
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:25,240
We gotta- We gotta set forth the Doki tax.

2330
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,980
Give me a box.

2331
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:30,180
Give me a chest right now.

2332
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,280
We need Doki tax.

2333
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:35,400
We need to bring it back.

2334
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:40,880
If you are living on my land, you need to pay your taxes.

2335
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,580
Everything the sun touches is my land.

2336
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:52,860
All right.

2337
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:55,960
All right.

2338
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:04,840
I gotta remember, like, where can I put this?

2339
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,720
Wait, can they put- They can't open- Oh, they can't open my chest on my land.

2340
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,640
So, I need to find the wilderness area.

2341
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,940
I need, like- One patch of wilderness for my taxes.

2342
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:17,540
Okay, here.

2343
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:19,860
All right.

2344
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,460
This is where- Alright, put a sign.

2345
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:23,560
Someone put a sign.

2346
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:31,040
Someone put a- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey- Hey, hey.

2347
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:34,960
Hey, hey, hey.

2348
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,100
Alright.

2349
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,280
I need a sign.

2350
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,100
Make a sign.

2351
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,500
Put it, Doki taxes.

2352
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:41,780
I'm delegating.

2353
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,420
You know how I used to like, do it myself?

2354
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:45,920
Now delegate my taxes.

2355
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:46,860
Go...

2356
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:51,420
Make a sign.

2357
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,040
Tell everyone that's where you put your taxes.

2358
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:54,940
Right there.

2359
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,500
Make it daytime too!

2360
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:08,720
Wait, can I?

2361
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,920
Do I have to...

2362
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,400
How do I do time again?

2363
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,180
I don't remember.

2364
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:13,620
Time.

2365
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:19,520
And...

2366
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:21,140
Did I do it?

2367
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,700
Oh, I did it.

2368
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,960
I did that this time.

2369
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:24,940
That's right.

2370
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,300
It'll never be nighttime in Doki land.

2371
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,120
That's right.

2372
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:35,680
Alright.

2373
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:36,240
Let's see.

2374
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:37,140
What was I plan... Oh, yeah.

2375
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:37,980
Okay.

2376
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,540
Land name Doki land.

2377
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,840
Did it work?

2378
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:45,880
Wait.

2379
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:46,820
What was it?

2380
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:47,900
Land rename.

2381
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:48,400
Okay.

2382
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:51,260
Land...

2383
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,800
Rename Doki land.

2384
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,820
When do I get Doki land back?

2385
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,980
I will find you.

2386
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:14,240
I will find you.

2387
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,480
You know, I'm gonna find you right now.

2388
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:18,540
I'm gonna find you right...

2389
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:20,060
I will find...

2390
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:20,920
I will find...

2391
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:21,300
Wait, what?

2392
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,060
Wait, what?

2393
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,080
That...

2394
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,480
When did I claim this area?

2395
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,260
Wait, wilderness.

2396
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:31,960
Is this mine?

2397
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,680
Is this accidentally my land?

2398
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:41,640
Wait.

2399
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:43,280
Wait, what...

2400
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:46,500
Okay.

2401
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,140
Okay, we got unclaimed this.

2402
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,740
I don't know how I have this land, too.

2403
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:51,900
Like, I...

2404
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:52,960
Unclaimed.

2405
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:54,840
Alright.

2406
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:57,420
Okay, this is the wilderness now.

2407
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:58,900
I was like, whose land is that?

2408
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:05,420
Okay, as long as this land is still mine, it's fine.

2409
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:07,680
Okay.

2410
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,120
I transferred all the land to me.

2411
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:16,080
I gotta make sure that this is still my land though.

2412
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:17,940
Yeah, alright, this is mine.

2413
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:22,660
From when you decide... Guys, I know I didn't invade Germany that one time.

2414
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,100
Alright, Doki Cult.

2415
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,500
I will find the one that took Doki Land.

2416
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,900
I will find it.

2417
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,200
I will find you.

2418
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:46,070
Apparently the research world might be bugged.

2419
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:47,150
Alright.

2420
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:52,270
Wilderness.

2421
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:54,870
Oh, someone claimed here.

2422
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:56,950
Okay, that's not you.

2423
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:58,430
I need to find the port.

2424
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:00,650
Uh...

2425
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,840
I think it's bugged.

2426
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,780
I can't... Alright, if there...

2427
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,840
If you guys, by the way...

2428
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,180
If there's any bugs or...

2429
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:13,240
Any issues that you find, just report it on the Discord server.

2430
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,140
And they'll like, record...

2431
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:17,620
They'll like, note it down and fix it.

2432
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,660
Ba-dum, ba-dum.

2433
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:25,560
Alright.

2434
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:27,040
Oh my god.

2435
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,320
I can't seem to find it.

2436
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:29,700
Okay.

2437
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,080
Spawn.

2438
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:31,800
Lobby.

2439
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,040
Oh yeah!

2440
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,460
By the way, we have a new feature.

2441
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:36,880
Wait, let's see.

2442
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,160
Where is it called?

2443
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,160
Spawn...

2444
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:41,520
Uh...

2445
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:44,680
Is it faction?

2446
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,720
Ha ha ha ha.

2447
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,300
Slash...

2448
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:51,320
Teleport...

2449
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:51,720
Lobby.

2450
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:53,760
What is it?

2451
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:56,740
Oh!

2452
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,240
Let's go to...

2453
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,120
Slash...

2454
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,040
Spawn...

2455
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:01,700
Oh, warp list.

2456
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:02,060
Okay.

2457
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,140
Slash...

2458
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,440
Spawn...

2459
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,460
Spawn.

2460
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:09,360
Wait, no, this is not the faction area.

2461
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:13,000
Where's the faction area?

2462
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:16,740
Slash warplist.

2463
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:17,100
Okay.

2464
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,440
There you go.

2465
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:25,940
Okay, so you can see here, if you do warplist, and then gladiator...

2466
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:26,740
How do I do that?

2467
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:30,040
And then we click gladiator arena.

2468
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,860
And then this is the PvP area.

2469
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,860
So all you have to do is...

2470
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:38,640
Pick your faction.

2471
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,280
And then you fight.

2472
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,540
Alright, don't worry.

2473
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:44,980
Set it to daytime!

2474
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,580
I demand for it to be day.

2475
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:56,380
Jokey bird has...

2476
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,140
Nice, alright.

2477
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:58,880
There we go.

2478
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:01,820
Trying to figure out how...

2479
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:02,000
Okay.

2480
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,840
So there's a gladiator arena.

2481
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:04,240
Now.

2482
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:06,800
And...

2483
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,880
Remember how to like...

2484
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:10,860
Set this up.

2485
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,440
Alright.

2486
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,720
It's right here.

2487
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:20,660
Match.

2488
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:23,180
So you click that.

2489
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,240
And we fight.

2490
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,740
Who's on the other side?

2491
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:32,340
That's right.

2492
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:34,500
We're gonna...

2493
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,820
I think I want to readjust this gladiator area though.

2494
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:37,840
Come on.

2495
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,760
Oh, it closes in 12 seconds.

2496
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,720
You can team up with other dragoons too.

2497
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:49,980
And everything.

2498
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,700
My five.

2499
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,480
Oh, shit.

2500
01:45:58,020 --> 01:45:58,260
Hello.

2501
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:00,700
Begins...

2502
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:01,800
Who's on the other side?

2503
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,280
I don't think there's any...

2504
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,400
Who is on the other side?

2505
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,680
Come forth dragoons.

2506
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:10,240
Defend your queen.

2507
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:15,320
That's right.

2508
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,500
It's PvP time.

2509
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:22,440
Go.

2510
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:25,400
It's 3v3.

2511
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,760
You guys can do it.

2512
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,320
I believe.

2513
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,220
I believe.

2514
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:33,980
I believe.

2515
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:36,960
That's right.

2516
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:37,480
Don't worry.

2517
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:38,000
I got you.

2518
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:39,460
I got you.

2519
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:40,680
Wait, but who's got me?

2520
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:41,860
Wait, but who's got me?

2521
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:42,760
Who's got me?

2522
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:43,720
Who's got me?

2523
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,060
Don't worry.

2524
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,160
They'll never expect a back.

2525
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,000
Wait, am I red or blue?

2526
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:51,400
I...

2527
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,260
Wait, what?

2528
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:56,620
Oh, I'm blue.

2529
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,840
Someone help me!

2530
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,540
I just forgot my color.

2531
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:08,220
Oh my God.

2532
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:08,900
It's just us two.

2533
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:09,680
Oh, no!

2534
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:14,500
You were supposed to defend me.

2535
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:15,680
You were...

2536
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,620
No elf.

2537
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,640
No elf.

2538
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:22,040
Just as the prophecy for Tooth.

2539
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:27,660
Nothing happened.

2540
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,060
I erased that history.

2541
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:30,940
What do you mean?

2542
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,080
I just logged in, guys.

2543
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:32,840
Nothing happened.

2544
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,260
No.

2545
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:37,640
What do you mean?

2546
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:39,160
Nothing happened.

2547
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,100
I just got here.

2548
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:44,160
Alright, back to my land.

2549
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:44,480
Oh, wait.

2550
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,400
TP home.

2551
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:48,440
Wait.

2552
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:49,800
How do I TP back?

2553
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:51,380
Home.

2554
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:54,100
Doki Birdo.

2555
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,860
Oh, it's at...

2556
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:55,960
Home.

2557
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:58,900
Doki Birdo.

2558
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:00,180
Wait, what?

2559
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:02,960
Home.

2560
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:06,460
I will find it.

2561
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:07,960
Oh, it's my land!

2562
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:08,500
Wait, no.

2563
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:08,860
What?

2564
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,700
Why does it say Doki Land?

2565
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,040
But, like, it's not Doki Land.

2566
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:13,400
Oh, wait.

2567
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:14,440
It was mine all alone?

2568
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,060
Home.

2569
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:17,840
Oh my God.

2570
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,880
It was mine all alone.

2571
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,180
Oh my God.

2572
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:21,400
Wait, what?

2573
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,260
It was mine all alone?

2574
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:32,580
What?

2575
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,540
This was my land?

2576
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,840
Oh my God.

2577
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,700
This was my land.

2578
01:48:48,840 --> 01:49:00,120
I was like, guys, that was not a safe TP.

2579
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:00,700
What

2580
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:24,680
happened to me?

2581
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:26,760
I was like, how could it not be safe?

2582
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:27,600
It's my land.

2583
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,160
I was so confused.

2584
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,500
I was like, guys, that was not a safe TP.

2585
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,520
That was absolutely not a safe TP.

2586
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:35,980
That, that...

2587
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:37,180
What just said?

2588
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:39,620
It said non-safe TP.

2589
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:40,860
I was like, that's not...

2590
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:41,900
That's not true.

2591
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,080
How could it not be safe?

2592
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:44,720
How could...

2593
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:48,860
How could that... How could that not be said?

2594
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,240
That's not possible.

2595
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:54,300
That's not... That's not possible.

2596
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:58,400
That was... What a wild TV.

2597
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,400
I... I was very confused.

2598
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,380
I was very confused.

2599
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:03,480
Alright.

2600
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:06,680
Okay.

2601
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,420
Slash spa.

2602
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:09,860
What?

2603
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:12,920
Slash... Home.

2604
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:15,760
Okay.

2605
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:23,160
Teleport.

2606
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:24,840
There we go.

2607
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,580
Why does it say Stokey Brito?

2608
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:27,020
Come on!

2609
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:27,640
Fix this!

2610
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:30,700
Just fix this!

2611
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,740
Come on!

2612
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,020
Fix this right now.

2613
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,540
Some teleport points.

2614
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:50,380
Some like... Home person from the old...

2615
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,440
It's a lottery.

2616
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:55,520
Why are you the way you are?

2617
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,860
What's that supposed to mean?

2618
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:00,720
Doki Land.

2619
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:03,160
Okay.

2620
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:03,620
Nice.

2621
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,040
This is a new home called Doki Land.

2622
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:08,160
Okay.

2623
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:11,920
Spawn.

2624
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:13,580
What?

2625
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:13,700
What?

2626
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:16,080
What?

2627
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:16,700
What?

2628
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:16,900
What?

2629
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:16,960
Okay.

2630
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,760
Slash... Home.

2631
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:26,020
Slash...

2632
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,100
Home.

2633
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,080
Doki Land.

2634
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:35,380
Teleport.

2635
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:36,980
Okay.

2636
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,700
Guys, we need to fix this.

2637
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:41,120
Why are you all here sitting in my land?

2638
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:42,040
Why?

2639
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:42,800
Why?

2640
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,320
Slash...

2641
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:45,740
Slash...

2642
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,120
Slash...

2643
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:47,590
Lands...

2644
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:48,400
Spawn.

2645
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:53,770
Oh my god.

2646
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:56,390
Okay.

2647
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:58,290
We're squatted.

2648
01:51:58,490 --> 01:51:59,050
Get out!

2649
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:00,390
This is my...

2650
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:01,210
Get out!

2651
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:02,150
Squat...

2652
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:02,470
Leave!

2653
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:03,690
Squatters!

2654
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:08,710
You can't fight them here.

2655
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:09,970
This area belongs...

2656
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:11,550
I am Doki Bird!

2657
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:16,320
Let me kill Doki Bird!

2658
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:17,560
I...

2659
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,280
I am Doki Bird!

2660
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,380
I am Doki Bird!

2661
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:29,740
We have to go...

2662
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:30,400
Hold D...

2663
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:31,380
Hold D...

2664
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,240
It won't let me kill!

2665
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:34,120
They're like...

2666
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:34,860
Oh, sorry.

2667
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:36,080
But like...

2668
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:36,380
Oh...

2669
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:36,980
It's gonna...

2670
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:38,700
You can't attack on the land.

2671
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:39,800
This belongs to...

2672
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:40,460
I...

2673
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:42,020
Not a...

2674
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:43,600
But doctor...

2675
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,200
I am Doki Bird!

2676
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:47,040
How do they know?

2677
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,480
I have to go to the old SMP apparently.

2678
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:54,440
Okay.

2679
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:55,960
Set...

2680
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:56,460
Time...

2681
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:57,320
Wait.

2682
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:58,600
Time...

2683
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,780
Set...

2684
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:00,460
Zero...

2685
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,180
There we go.

2686
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:03,880
So I can see this.

2687
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:05,740
Join the squad.

2688
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:06,940
Squatters Union.

2689
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:12,400
How dare you take my home?

2690
01:53:19,210 --> 01:53:19,770
Oh.

2691
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:20,650
By the way.

2692
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:24,410
There's lag because they're increasing ram loads on the main SMP right now.

2693
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:26,790
They're increasing the...

2694
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:27,170
Ram load.

2695
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:28,290
That's like...

2696
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:30,290
Why did you think I went to the old SMP?

2697
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:32,470
I didn't warn you.

2698
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:33,290
That's right.

2699
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:35,050
You squatters...

2700
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:35,390
I...

2701
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:36,010
That's right.

2702
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:37,050
I didn't...

2703
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:40,010
Why did you think I TP'd to the old SMP?

2704
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:41,990
That's fucking right.

2705
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:44,110
That's what you squatters deserve.

2706
01:53:46,590 --> 01:53:48,030
That's evil.

2707
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:49,310
That's right.

2708
01:53:49,310 --> 01:53:52,010
I didn't inform you guys what was happening.

2709
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:56,710
Oh my god.

2710
01:53:56,710 --> 01:53:58,550
There's like a whole fucking village here.

2711
01:53:58,650 --> 01:53:59,350
Holy shit.

2712
01:53:59,350 --> 01:54:00,990
That's so cool.

2713
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:03,410
You monster.

2714
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:04,310
That's right.

2715
01:54:04,390 --> 01:54:06,250
Be trapped in the fucking void.

2716
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:11,930
That's right.

2717
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:13,390
No rights for squatters.

2718
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:17,650
You get sent to the void.

2719
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:20,470
You're not allowed to squat on Doki land.

2720
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:24,250
Oh, boy crap.

2721
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:28,170
I avoided the void.

2722
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:31,270
Stupid.

2723
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:34,190
Why did you think I fucking TP'd out of here?

2724
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:40,150
The resource zone is so that you guys can grab resources without having to...

2725
01:54:41,790 --> 01:54:43,190
Without having to...

2726
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:43,830
What's the word?

2727
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:45,990
Destroy everything.

2728
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:48,590
Oh, wait.

2729
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:49,450
Oh, no.

2730
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:51,070
It's the old SMP turn.

2731
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:51,790
Oh, no.

2732
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:52,490
I can't move.

2733
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:57,130
So you don't have to deforest everything as well as the...

2734
01:54:58,930 --> 01:54:59,450
Um...

2735
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:00,530
Um...

2736
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:02,570
You know, mow down the hills and everything.

2737
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:03,490
What's that word again?

2738
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:04,090
You know?

2739
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:07,050
When they have to like...

2740
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:08,250
Um...

2741
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:10,730
Level the hills and stuff for resources.

2742
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,500
The flattening.

2743
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:16,740
Yeah, you don't have to flatten shit.

2744
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:17,840
Oh, wait.

2745
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:19,140
TP...

2746
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,160
Scar...

2747
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:21,760
Wait.

2748
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,300
Do a TP request to me.

2749
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,000
Because I'm...

2750
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,900
Do a TP request.

2751
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,160
Yeah, we don't have to terraform the actual land.

2752
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:33,660
Okay, that's not...

2753
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:34,900
Okay, I'll...

2754
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:36,780
I'll check it out.

2755
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:39,640
Is it here?

2756
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:40,540
No.

2757
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:42,540
Yeah.

2758
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:44,400
What is this?

2759
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:46,860
Praise to these...

2760
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:48,680
What once was lost shall return.

2761
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,000
Black nights forever.

2762
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:50,680
Aww.

2763
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:53,360
Who picked this color?

2764
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:56,540
I was like...

2765
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,860
Oh, that's sweet.

2766
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,140
And then...

2767
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:00,380
Who picked this color?

2768
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:01,060
Ooh.

2769
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:05,920
That's cool.

2770
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:13,080
Oh, it's scroll wheel.

2771
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:14,640
Oh, I was scroll wheeling.

2772
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:17,800
Oh my god.

2773
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:21,420
That's so cool.

2774
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,320
I was like wondering why I was so slow.

2775
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:29,420
Come on.

2776
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:31,020
Meow meow meow meow.

2777
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,060
Okay.

2778
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,000
We have double the ramp capacity.

2779
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:37,540
Alright.

2780
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,220

01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:40,000
Alright.

2782
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:41,100
Now we can go back.

2783
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:42,680
Am I allowed to go back now?

2784
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,540
Also, I'm gonna grab Tissue real quick.

2785
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:46,680
I need to blow my nose.

2786
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:47,300
I'll be right back.

2787
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:30,040
Okay.

2788
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:32,560
Also, the resource world is fixed.

2789
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:36,240
Alright.

2790
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:38,980
Meow meow meow.

2791
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:41,720
What is it?

2792
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:42,320
Dookie SMP?

2793
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:45,140
There you go.

2794
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:45,860
I should be back.

2795
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:46,220
Oh.

2796
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,640
I forgot how to do it again.

2797
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:49,620
I forgot how to do it again.

2798
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:51,220
I forgot how to do it again.

2799
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:55,600
I think it was...

2800
01:57:58,260 --> 01:57:59,140
What is it?

2801
01:57:59,340 --> 01:57:59,960

01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:09,680
Okay.

2813
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:12,340
We did it.

2814
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:12,840
Alright.

2815
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,040

2819
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:22,140
There we go.

2820
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:24,300
Okay.

2821
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:26,620
Is it still called Doki land yet?

2822
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:29,640
Is my land called Doki land again?

2823
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:31,560
I gotta know.

2824
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,900
Why can't I fight on my own land?

2825
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:41,260
Get out of here, squatters!

2826
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:43,180
That's it.

2827
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:43,960

I can see... I'm going to wait until I see your name, squatters.

2831
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:51,660
Get out!

2832
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:58,680

2833
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:03,540
Rename Doki land.

Did that work?

2838
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,240
Wait.

2839
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,580
Unknown command?

2840
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:20,060
Okay.

2843
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,320
You have to pay rent!

2844
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:30,860
Okay.

2845
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:32,340
Lands rename.

01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:35,460
Okay.

2847
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:41,580

2851
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:50,860
Wait.

2852
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:54,460
Lands rename Doki...

2853
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:55,200
Doki.

2854
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:01,960
Okay.

2855
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:02,260
Okay.

That's fine.

2857
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:04,500
That's fine.

2858
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,540
That's fine.

2859
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:05,920
That's fine.

2860
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,800
I don't know where my hair is.

2861
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:12,080
Okay.

2862
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:12,740
What's your name?

2863
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:13,980
What are my squatters' names?

2864
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:15,420
What are their names?

2865
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:17,020
Oh my god.

2866
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:17,700
They're all together.

2867
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:18,580
What is...

2868
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:21,000

That's right!

2872
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:29,990
You saw what I did to Oscar?

2873
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:31,990
That's right, squatters!

2874
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:33,530
You think I can...

2875
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:34,370
That's right!

2876
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:39,250
What if you don't leave my land in 10 seconds?

2877
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:43,890
I'll start killing you off one by one!

02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:30,810
I can kill you all!

2895
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:38,510
Leave my land!

2896
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:47,820
I own this land!

2897
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:51,480
Get out!

2898
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:52,980
Get out!

02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:06,390
Who owns!

You're in the resource world?

2907
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:22,230
Where am I?

Oh, I renamed it?

2920
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:55,370
Oh my god.

2921
02:02:57,630 --> 02:02:58,370
You know what?

There we go.

2932
02:03:40,210 --> 02:03:42,810

02:03:43,330 --> 02:03:43,470
Okay.

2934
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:46,670

How is it still taken?

2937
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:00,890
Kroki!

2938
02:04:01,290 --> 02:04:04,750
Find me, find me, tell me who it is that took my other name.

2939
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:06,250
Who the only one?

2940
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:17,510
Time, time, set, zero, zero seconds.

2941
02:04:17,730 --> 02:04:17,870
There you go.

2942
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:20,250
It'll never be night time until I figure this out.

It'll never be...

2945
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,230
Silent Kroki!

2946
02:04:25,570 --> 02:04:28,490
Find me the one who took my other... my name again.

2947
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:32,530
You need to be fast.

2948
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:34,430
Yep, alright.

2949
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:35,950
TP!

2950
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:39,350
Get in!

2951
02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:40,610
Okay, get in here!

2952
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,670
Thanos, get in here!

2953
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:43,770
Kill all these people on my... Kill all the squatters!

2954
02:04:44,530 --> 02:04:52,510
Kill all the... Get over here!

2955
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:54,750
Saturn, kill all the squatters!

2956
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:02,580
That's right!

2957
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:08,680
They are leaving!

2958
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:13,510
That's right!

2959
02:05:13,890 --> 02:05:14,750
Do it!

2960
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:19,050
Alright, imitates, alright.

2961
02:05:21,730 --> 02:05:24,630
Give all... Where are you?

2962
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:25,670
TP!

2963
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:32,240
Who has claimed my land?

2964
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:34,560
Silently croaky!

2965
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:35,580
Find who can...

2966
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:36,700
Who claimed my land?

2967
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:41,680
Who took my land so I can copyright strike them?

2968
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:43,860
Okay.

2969
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,860
I need me original land.

2970
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:49,180
Alright, let's see.

2971
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:53,940
Slash... No, I lost my parent.

2972
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:55,180
Okay.

2973
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:59,620
Land... Land... Rename.

2974
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:02,940
Doki Land Original.

2975
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,760
Doki World.

2976
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:05,460
Okay.

2977
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:05,920
Yeah.

2978
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,500
Doki World.

2979
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:09,540
You know how there's Disneyland and Disney World?

2980
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:10,880
Doki World.

2981
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:12,100
There we go.

2982
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:22,270
Doki World.

2983
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:22,270
There we go.

2984
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:22,850
There we go.

2985
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:24,890
Doki World.

2986
02:06:26,030 --> 02:06:27,130
A fun.

2987
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:32,370
Void on Doki Land immediately locked up.

2988
02:06:33,910 --> 02:06:34,470
Doki World.

2989
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:35,290
Oh my god.

2990
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:36,130
Oh my god.

2991
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:38,790
Wipe this man's... Alright, where is his land?

2992
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:39,890
I'm unclaiming his land.

2993
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:42,230
Kroaky, tell me where he lives.

2994
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:43,450
I'll unclaim his land.

2995
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:47,410
Log back in or I'll unclaim your land right now, Void on.

2996
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:54,750
Log back in right now.

2997
02:06:55,790 --> 02:06:57,730
I know where you live.

2998
02:06:57,990 --> 02:07:00,310
I will unclaim your land.

2999
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:07,050
Okay, there we go.

3000
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:08,190
Okay.

3001
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:13,130
Get back here.

3002
02:07:13,550 --> 02:07:17,110
My mods... My mods... My mods got me here.

3003
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:18,490
Alright, wait.

3004
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:20,110
I need... Take me up there.

3005
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:26,990
I know where you live.

3006
02:07:27,650 --> 02:07:28,630
That's right.

3007
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:32,250
If you don't show up, I am unclaiming your land.

3008
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:33,890
I... No.

3009
02:07:34,690 --> 02:07:36,530
I can take your shit, too.

3010
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:39,950
That's... I have the power to take your stuff, too.

3011
02:07:40,670 --> 02:07:42,570
Nobody found it.

3012
02:07:47,110 --> 02:07:48,410
That's right.

3013
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:51,610
On a count of ten.

3014
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:57,470
If you don't show up right now, I'm unclaiming this land.

3015
02:07:57,470 --> 02:08:00,870
I'm unclaiming it for myself, too.

3016
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:01,690
Right after.

3017
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:06,690
Ten.

3018
02:08:07,470 --> 02:08:08,410
Nine.

3019
02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:10,430
Eight.

3020
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:12,190
Seven.

3021
02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:13,770
Six.

3022
02:08:14,790 --> 02:08:15,530
Five.

3023
02:08:16,910 --> 02:08:17,610
Four.

3024
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:19,570
Three.

3025
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:21,610
Two.

3026
02:08:22,510 --> 02:08:23,190
One.

3027
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:24,650
Unclaim.

3028
02:08:29,650 --> 02:08:31,490
That's fucking right.

3029
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:32,410
All right.

3030
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:33,170
TP.

3031
02:08:34,670 --> 02:08:36,030
Homes list.

3032
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:39,090
All right.

3033
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:43,840
Lan.

3034
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:49,360
Lan's rename Doki Lan.

3035
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:52,120
Are you... Who took it again?

3036
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:55,000
Who... Who took it again?

3037
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:56,360
Who took the Lan again?

3038
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:10,830
Who... Oh my god.

3039
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:15,890
I will log in when everyone is asleep and I will fucking take back my Lan.

3040
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:22,230
I... She's incoming to... Someone is still Tokyo World.

3041
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:25,250
Someday she'll get the name.

3042
02:09:25,450 --> 02:09:25,910
All right.

3043
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:26,950
That's it.

3044
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:29,130
I'm filing a trademark on Doki World.

3045
02:09:29,310 --> 02:09:31,130
At least I have Doki World.

3046
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:34,530
I... I have... I have Doki World.

3047
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:40,330
Dracula's don't sleep.

3048
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:42,690
Just give me the name.

3049
02:09:42,830 --> 02:09:43,970
I won't do anything yet.

3050
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:47,190
Is that... Why is he still killing people?

3051
02:09:48,050 --> 02:09:52,850
He's just... He's just killing people since I... I'm on my whole arc.

3052
02:09:52,910 --> 02:09:55,610
I'm trying to find the... The one who took Doki Land.

3053
02:09:55,790 --> 02:09:57,670
And Thanos is still snapping people.

3054
02:09:58,190 --> 02:09:58,890
He's still...

3055
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:06,230
There's only you there.

3056
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:07,750
Hundreds of us.

3057
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:09,390
All right.

3058
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:12,270
Tell me who took the next... Who took... Who took it again?

3059
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:13,650
Kroki.

3060
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:14,330
Tell me who.

3061
02:10:14,490 --> 02:10:15,530
I won't do anything yet.

3062
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:16,290
For now.

3063
02:10:16,910 --> 02:10:19,490
I won't... I won't do anything for now.

3064
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:21,310
I didn't tell that's true.

3065
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:22,670
I didn't tell him to stop.

3066
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:24,590
I will find out.

3067
02:10:26,090 --> 02:10:27,370
I will know.

3068
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:32,170
You can't avoid it.

3069
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:37,070
Squad is right there.

3070
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:38,230
No Doki Land.

3071
02:10:38,230 --> 02:10:40,110
I'll make sure of it.

3072
02:10:40,390 --> 02:10:41,790
I'll find out.

3073
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:45,090
I'll find out.

3074
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:49,290
I want to know... Where's the... Is this the port side?

3075
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:54,750
Is this the... Is this the old Doki Land port?

3076
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:56,190
Right here?

3077
02:10:56,850 --> 02:10:59,430
Great Dragoon Massacre.

3078
02:10:59,430 --> 02:10:59,630
Here.

3079
02:11:04,870 --> 02:11:06,310
I'm not afraid.

3080
02:11:06,810 --> 02:11:09,330
Was this... Was this the old... Ye old Belgium.

3081
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:10,050
There's Belgium.

3082
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:13,970
Is that the... Is this the Ye old Doki Land port?

3083
02:11:14,170 --> 02:11:15,030
Or is it towards the village?

3084
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:16,110
Which one is this?

3085
02:11:16,110 --> 02:11:16,670
Is it back here?

3086
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:23,210
All right.

3087
02:11:23,790 --> 02:11:25,190
This is the... Is this... What?

3088
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,590
Did that say East Germany?

3089
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:33,250
Oh shit.

3090
02:11:33,450 --> 02:11:34,190
There's a beacon.

3091
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:39,700
Is it closer to the lobby?

3092
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:41,540
Or is it?

3093
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:44,320
I can't seem to find...

3094
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,680
Because I've lost...

3095
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:47,280
I've lost the...

3096
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,720
The old port.

3097
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:51,700
The Ye old Doki Land port.

3098
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:58,560
I'll find out who it is.

3099
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:05,940
We figured it out.

3100
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,200
Wait.

3101
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:08,180
I figured it out.

3102
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:10,380
Poems list.

3103
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:17,770
Lands.

3104
02:12:19,730 --> 02:12:20,510
Rename...

3105
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:21,830
Doki Land.

3106
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:23,910
You liar!

3107
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:29,770
You liar, Kroki!

3108
02:12:35,650 --> 02:12:36,110
You liar,

3109
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:51,310
Kroki!

3110
02:12:51,490 --> 02:12:51,930
You liar,

3111
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:04,950
Kroki!

3112
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:06,190
You liar, Kroki!

3113
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:06,590
You liar, Kroki!

3114
02:13:06,590 --> 02:13:06,970
You liar, Kroki!

3115
02:13:06,970 --> 02:13:07,070
You liar, Kroki!

3116
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:07,590
You liar, Kroki!

3117
02:13:07,590 --> 02:13:08,030
You liar, Kroki!

3118
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:08,410
You liar, Kroki!

3119
02:13:08,410 --> 02:13:10,490
I actually thought you got away.

3120
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:22,570
Okay.

3121
02:13:23,130 --> 02:13:23,870
Okay.

3122
02:13:24,450 --> 02:13:34,710
Okay, unclaim it right now.

3123
02:13:35,110 --> 02:13:37,090
Force unclaim his land right now.

3124
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:39,190
It never ends.

3125
02:13:39,190 --> 02:13:40,310
There was...

3126
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:42,550
Kroki was helping.

3127
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:47,070
No, Kroki told me he told me he was back on.

3128
02:13:47,330 --> 02:13:49,190
He told me he was back on.

3129
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:50,190
Killed him.

3130
02:13:50,370 --> 02:13:51,590
Unclaim the land.

3131
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:53,010
And now we're here.

3132
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:54,270
Now...

3133
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:03,420
When one falls...

3134
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:06,240
Lands.

3135
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:08,900
Okay, I'm waiting.

3136
02:14:08,980 --> 02:14:10,560
I'm waiting until he force...

3137
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,660
Force the name out.

3138
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:14,020
And then I'm fucking renaming it.

3139
02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:14,500
I'm ready.

3140
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:17,220
Okay.

3141
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:18,480
Force...

3142
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:19,620
Unclaim...

3143
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:21,160
Unclaim his land right now.

3144
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:23,700
He is hiding underground.

3145
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:24,980
He

3146
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:55,720
is hiding underground.

3147
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:55,800
That's...

3148
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:02,460
I don't know why.

3149
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:06,040
I don't know why he tried the run.

3150
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:07,340
Wait, that's...

3151
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:07,800
Alright.

3152
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:09,140
Okay.

3153
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:09,880
Keep unclaiming.

3154
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:10,920
Keep unclaiming.

3155
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:12,200
I'll be here.

3156
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:12,880
Keep unclaiming.

3157
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:14,980
Keep...

3158
02:15:14,980 --> 02:15:15,960
Keep unclaiming.

3159
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:19,120
I'll eventually be my name.

3160
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:19,980
My world.

3161
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:20,020
My world.

3162
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:21,940
It's a fear.

3163
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:25,020
Doki land belongs to the dragoons.

3164
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,280
You are on Doki land!

3165
02:15:30,860 --> 02:15:31,600
Alright.

3166
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,040
Cactus is...

3167
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:34,760
Where is he?

3168
02:15:35,220 --> 02:15:36,040
Where is he?

3169
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:36,960
Where's Cactus?

3170
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:39,160
Where is he?

3171
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:45,360
Who keeps claiming it before I can claim it?

3172
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:49,800
He...

3173
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:50,920
He trapped...

3174
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:06,980
Okay.

3175
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:09,140
We gotta be trapped in my mod.

3176
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:11,800
He actually trapped my mod.

3177
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:13,300
So I had to...

3178
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:15,320
He trapped my mod.

3179
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:16,820
So I had to save him.

3180
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:22,280
Alright.

3181
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:31,560
Other mods!

3182
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:32,440
Help him!

3183
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:34,180
Help Sonic Kroki!

3184
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:35,900
My other mods!

3185
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:36,860
Help him!

3186
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:39,100
We'll kill the rest later.

3187
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,740
I need you all to...

3188
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:45,220
I need you to help Kroki.

3189
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:47,840
So I can trap my land back.

3190
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:54,820
Alright.

3191
02:16:56,380 --> 02:16:56,940
Eventually.

3192
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:01,020
We'll grab the rest.

3193
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,080
We'll kill the squatters.

3194
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:02,580
Also.

3195
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:05,320
After I grab my land.

3196
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:07,740
Give me power so I can kill in my land.

3197
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:10,560
Because apparently I can't attack people in Doki world.

3198
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:12,320
Even though I own Doki world.

3199
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:13,620
I own...

3200
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:21,180
I own Doki world but for some reason it's not letting me kill people in my world.

3201
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:23,520
Alright.

3202
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:24,260
Let me know.

3203
02:17:25,220 --> 02:17:26,060
Let me know.

3204
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:26,900
Let me know when it's been done.

3205
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:28,780
Let me know when it's been done.

3206
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:30,180
The Emperor wasn't.

3207
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:31,540
Wait.

3208
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:32,280
Proof!

3209
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:33,140
Okay.

3210
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:33,860
You guys want proof?

3211
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:34,600
Here you go.

3212
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:35,780
Watch this.

3213
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:37,860
Alright.

3214
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:43,120
Doki world of Doki Birdo.

3215
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:47,100
That's...

3216
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:48,320
That's a lie.

3217
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:52,600
How many land does he have?

3218
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,980
How much land does he have?

3219
02:17:55,940 --> 02:18:19,770
How much land does he have?

3220
02:18:19,770 --> 02:18:20,610
Unwhitelist.

3221
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:23,910
Unwhitelist him.

3222
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:24,830
Right now.

3223
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:25,430
Kick him out.

3224
02:18:25,530 --> 02:18:25,870
I'm kicking.

3225
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:33,690
Alright.

3226
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:34,790
Unclaim his land.

3227
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,260
Unclaim his land.

3228
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:44,080
Take him a while to get back in.

3229
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:50,540
She's going mad now.

3230
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:51,760
So...

3231
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:52,300
Alright.

3232
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:53,260
Alright.

3233
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:54,400
Alright.

3234
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:57,780
Bro's gonna wait 10 hours in the void.

3235
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:58,460
Alright.

3236
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,260
Let me know.

3237
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:00,660
Let me know.

3238
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:02,860
If it keeps escalating.

3239
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,180
They knew the risk.

3240
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:07,580
They knew the risk.

3241
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:10,080
They knew the risk.

3242
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:20,280
They knew the risk.

3243
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:23,200
How do you claim the land already?

3244
02:19:28,030 --> 02:19:31,770
The Doki SMP situation is crazy.

3245
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:33,330
How does everyone...

3246
02:19:33,330 --> 02:19:34,110
Keep...

3247
02:19:34,110 --> 02:19:34,350
Okay.

3248
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:44,660
I'm gonna wait till you're asleep.

3249
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,140
I'm gonna wait till you're asleep.

3250
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:53,410
Then...

3251
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:57,200
You'll be the last person who owns Doki Land.

3252
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:00,320
And when you log off, it's over for you.

3253
02:20:06,030 --> 02:20:06,360
Alright.

3254
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:12,160
Alright.

3255
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:16,180
That's so cute.

3256
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:17,280
Okay.

3257
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:18,060
Alright.

3258
02:20:18,340 --> 02:20:19,560
We'll figure this out later.

3259
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:22,380
We'll figure out this later.

3260
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:23,300
Alright.

3261
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:25,840
Okay.

3262
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:26,220
Okay.

3263
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:26,360
So.

3264
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:27,540
Um.

3265
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:29,060
Silent Croaky.

3266
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,900
Why can't I kill people on my land?

3267
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:33,000
Fix this.

3268
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:33,620
Right now.

3269
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:42,360
Fix this right now.

3270
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:44,820
I renamed.

3271
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:48,580
That is not true.

3272
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:49,640
That...

3273
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:50,920
I am track.

3274
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:52,900
That is not true.

3275
02:20:54,940 --> 02:20:55,920
That's great.

3276
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:00,780
Why can't I kill people?

3277
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:01,860
This is my land.

3278
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:03,800
What is this?

3279
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:09,260
No.

3280
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:12,200
If you own the land, you can hit other people.

3281
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:13,720
In your own land.

3282
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:18,100
So.

3283
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:19,860
I should be allowed...

3284
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:22,760
To attack players.

3285
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:25,220
In my own land.

3286
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:26,580
But I can't for some reason.

3287
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:28,360
So I'm trying to figure this out.

3288
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:32,240
The moment.

3289
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:32,800
The moment.

3290
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:33,980
A moment.

3291
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:35,620
The moment I- Wait.

3292
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:37,380
Why can't I hit my own mod?

3293
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:41,600
I- I can hit my own mod!berty!

3294
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:44,580
Wait.

3295
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:45,580
Where is he?

3296
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:46,120
Wait.

3297
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:47,100
Where is he?

3298
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:47,820
I'm mad.

3299
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:50,600
Why can I do anything?

3300
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:52,240
Why can't I kill my people?

3301
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:53,400
Why?

3302
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,020
Oh shit.

3303
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:56,460
Oh shit.

3304
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:57,940
Oh shit.

3305
02:21:57,940 --> 02:21:58,280
That's right!

3306
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:01,720
If I can kill Thanos, I will do it to you, too!

3307
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:06,640
I don't know why I can't find a piece...

3308
02:22:16,690 --> 02:22:17,230
TP...

3309
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:20,250
Wait, how did I die?

3310
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:22,830
Justice...

3311
02:22:22,830 --> 02:22:25,910
Not even mods are safe...

3312
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:30,630
Wait, why can't I...

3313
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:31,330
Oh, teleport.

3314
02:22:32,590 --> 02:22:33,630
Where's my stuff?

3315
02:22:34,170 --> 02:22:35,190
Where's my stuff?

3316
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:36,910
Where did I die?

3317
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:37,690
Where's my stuff?

3318
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:41,850
Why were they able to get my stuff?

3319
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:43,650
My stuff!

3320
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:53,580
Who was it?

3321
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:54,800
Who took my stuff?

3322
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:56,060
Who took it?

3323
02:22:57,540 --> 02:22:59,040
Who took my things?

3324
02:22:59,380 --> 02:23:00,720
Who took my stuff?

3325
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:04,300
Oh my god, there's so many squatters now!

3326
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:07,380
There's so many squatters!

3327
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:10,100
What do you mean?

3328
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:10,800
That's it!

3329
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:12,400
Wipe everybody's inventory!

3330
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:14,700
Wipe everyone's inventory now!

3331
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:25,200
Now that... Wipe... everyone's inventory.

3332
02:23:28,660 --> 02:23:29,940
That's right.

3333
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:31,720
That's right!

3334
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,760
Everyone's inventory!

3335
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:35,440
Gone!

3336
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:42,020
All right!

3337
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:44,240
That's right!

3338
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:45,760
Everyone gets punished!

3339
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:49,020
Everyone gets punished now!

3340
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:51,620
Wait, the Wipe!

3341
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:56,140
We all suffer!

3342
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:57,420
That's right!

3343
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:58,740
You did this!

3344
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:01,420
Now I'm stranded!

3345
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:07,700
That's right!

3346
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:10,080
That's right!

3347
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,180
Nobody fucks with me!

3348
02:24:13,340 --> 02:24:15,360
Guilty by association!

3349
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:17,600
That's right!

3350
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,780
Have you all learned your lesson now?

3351
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:22,780
Have you?

3352
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:24,480
Oh, shit!

3353
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:25,700
Oh, shit!

3354
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:27,380
The BBC back to throw key world!

3355
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:30,720
Wait, my claim!

3356
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:32,340
Oh, shit!

3357
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,120
Also, give us all our claim items!

3358
02:24:34,220 --> 02:24:35,580
We don't have claim items anymore!

3359
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:37,020
Guys, we don't have...

3360
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:38,860
Guys, we can't claim anything!

3361
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:39,720
Wait!

3362
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:41,600
This is not a throw key!

3363
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:42,740
Give us our...

3364
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:44,240
At least give us our claim items!

3365
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:46,080
Give us our claim items!

3366
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:51,380
You robbed me of my own!

3367
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:54,500
Not nice if I get none of...

3368
02:24:56,780 --> 02:25:01,320
Okay, maybe we shouldn't have, like, wiped everything all at once!

3369
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:03,000
This was a little...

3370
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:03,660
Oopsie!

3371
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:10,380
Alright, so I think that's a good time!

3372
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,380
That's a good time to call it!

3373
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:15,580
Well, that's not a croaky fix this mess!

3374
02:25:16,060 --> 02:25:18,000
Well, we'll let him fix everything!

3375
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,360
We'll let him fix it all!

3376
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:20,040
We'll...

3377
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:25,700
We'll...

3378
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:26,740
I'll let him fix it!

3379
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:27,520
I'll...

3380
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:32,180
I'll...

02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:32,780
