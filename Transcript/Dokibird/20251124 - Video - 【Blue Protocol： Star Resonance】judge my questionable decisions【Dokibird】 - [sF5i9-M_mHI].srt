Pre-recorded Doki here, and we are back with another
sponsored video!

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,220
Bum-Bum-Bum!

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,020
Today, I am sponsored by Blue Protocol Star Resonance to
check out their newest MMORPG experience in an

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,240
anime-inspired world with its immersive PvE combat with
casual gameplay, creating dynamic and accessible adventures

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,880
for all types of players.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,880
And, best of all, it's currently available now!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Yes, right now on PC and mobile.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
So, I guess you know the drill, Dragoons.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,080
Make sure to click the link in the description below and try
to game out.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,680
All right, other pre-recorded Toki, it's time to take it
away.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
No chat is here to help you.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,400
For one guy, you throw at least.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,740
Wow, thank you pre-recorded Toki.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,440
That was a great intro.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,120
Have you ever thought about becoming and transitioning to
live Toki?

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,400
Let's dive into it.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,240
So, apparently, you can create your own character, team up
for raids, or have fun with friends exploring and crafting i

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:12,960
don't know if i'm gonna make any friends today but we'll see
all right body type oh oh my gosh do i want to be me or okay

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,120

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,260
Yeah, you know, you know who you are.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
I mean, I really like the default eyes.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,980
You're already so cute.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,220
I mean, I'm already so cute.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,260
Oh, I have stars.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,720
Oh, wait, that's so cute.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,640
That's so retro, Doki.

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,100
Oh, wait, I'm buffed this.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,420
Oh.

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,400
Very accurate.

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,540
Very accurate, Doki.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,160
Right there.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Best performer.

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,740
Because I was in long range using guitar as a weapon.

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,800
He knows.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,880
Wait, is this a bar?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,480
I would like to be the guitar man, please.

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,720
If they don't like my music, then they gotta speak to my
guitar.

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,240
All right, hello.

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,780
Yes, I'm floating.

42
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,460
I can't see clearly.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,480
Oh, let's go into the danger.

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,920
That's always a good idea.

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm so smart.

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,560
It's like a horror movie where instead you turn around, you
go straight in.

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,900
Straight into the danger.

48
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,000
Nothing bad can happen.

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,720
Oh, yeah, I got used to guide.

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
It's what I've always wanted.

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,720

I mean, someone's gonna take Doki Bird as soon as the
sponsor videos out.

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,100
Yeah, but you won't be the leader of the Doki Bird Guild.

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,480
Oh, this is a big-ass city.

63
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,220
Okay.

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,940
Oh, are these real people?

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,480
How big is this map?

Okay.

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,280
Speak like you weren't raised by AI.

84
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,720
Wait, that's so good.

85
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,300
I gotta use that for future insult.

86
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,340
Oh, there's a bounty.

87
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,020
Wait, bounty means money.

88
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,260
Let's grab that.

89
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,240
I won't progress enough so that I can make a guild.

90
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,480
Just gotta go outside.

91
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,940
Time to go to danger.

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,720
It's fine.

93
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,140
I have my guitar with me.

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,960
Check it out.

95
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,080
There's Luna on the ground.

96
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,840
Where is it?

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,380
Are raising and pricing Even Capricorns are raising in the
spam.

98
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,220
Oh, okay.

99
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,160
A fortune we might collect.

100
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,620
All right, time to kill some animals, I guess.

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,280
Oh, oh, the level three.

102
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,000
That's right.

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,420
Get over here.

104
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,440
That's like, what you're meat?

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,560
All right.

106
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,760
What did I get out of it?

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,420
Oh, my God.

108
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, just spawn here.

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
Wait, that's so convenient.

110
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,220
That's right.

111
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,920
I'll use everything.

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,520
How much?

113
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,300
Okay, I need three.

114
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,600
All right.

115
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,300
It's not overkill, guys.

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm gonna ult.

117
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,760
Giving some sick-ass beats.

118
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,940
Her skill is exceptional.

119
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,280
Far beyond most rookies.

120
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,020
The way you pursue that tale, there's something oddly
familiar.

121
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,160
What can I say?

122
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,020
I'm talented.

123
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,780
I'm so humble.

124
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
So humble.

125
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,680
Oh, these are the goblins.

126
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,780
There's the snow knight.

127
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,060
Oh, there she is.

128
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,500
He?

129
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:09,960
She?

130
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,360
Oh, that's cute.

131
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,580
That's a cute outfit.

132
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,160
Very intimidating.

133
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,040
That's a snow knight sang there.

134
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,460
Yeah, that's definitely...

135
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,880
It's a midsummer miracle.

136
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,120
Okay, we can all...

137
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,040
We should see that he's not a real snowman.

138
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,860
Can we not?

139
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,160
Alright, we both have, like, zero IQ running in this noggin.

140
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Oh, wait, she...

141
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,040
They know each other.

142
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,580
Um, that's not Lady Rona.

143
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,680
That's a cosplay.

144
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,700
That's just a Lady Rona impersonator.

145
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,240
So now the goblins?

146
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,220
Yeah, they...

147
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,800
Oh, wait, what?

148
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,780

149
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,280

00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,250
Oh my god.

288
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,010

With no helmet.

292
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,930
There's also a third limited outfit and I think you got,
it's from the battle pass here.

293
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,530
So, I think you have to get to level 30 on the void pass 2
and it's called Envoy of Night.

294
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,790
And you can get it after purchasing the void pass 2 and
getting it to level 30.

295
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:25,370
So you get to look like either this dapper young man or this
hot late young lady and i think they have there was one more

296
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:32,790
thing i need to show you guys there's another special
feature here called dragon shackle event and it's like a 10
