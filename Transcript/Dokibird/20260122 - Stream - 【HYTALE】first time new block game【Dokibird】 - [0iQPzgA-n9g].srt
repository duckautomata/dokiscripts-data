1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,260
hello everyone hello hello um we were snuffy and i we were
doing some tech support today and it did not go so well so

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,520
at first at first i i got everything set up like i was like
good to go i was like i got this and then i was like i got

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,400
the server already it was going to be hosted on my end
because they said you can do that and i was like are stuffy

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,980
you download all these mods just to be sure and then i was
like all right join my server and then she for some reason

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:47,580
it was like failed to connect and you're like oh something's
wrong failed to connect i was like oh what and then i was

6
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,000
like all right so how about i join you and then i tried
joining her and it was like failed to connect maybe the host

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,400
is offline or firewalls or some shit and then i was just
like this is the mods we uninstalled all the mods and was

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,760
like going on a full the mods that i wanted to do was
proximity chat by the way the proximity voice comms um like

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,620
i the thing is while all this was happening and i was like
directing snuffy on how to do this and this she had her

10
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:20,960
entire screen shared to me so while i was like explaining
stuff and i was just like okay so i'm gonna do this and i'm

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:30,120
gonna do that i heard i see her pull up go on chrome and i
see her pull up heated rivalry while i'm trying to plain

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:38,900
text support to snuffy somebody sent me a link I swear and I
was just like oh I guess I'll just click this and see how

13
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,500
did you know and I was like snuffy I can see your screen
what do you mean how do I know for those who don't know what

14
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:54,460
heated rivalry is it's basically gay hockey drama so it's
about two men in hockey in Canadian uh one Canadian one

15
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,760
Russian who are in the closet and it's like the newest big
show right now on hpo right so and they're all like in the

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:09,120
clouds and you're having the secret gay relationship um um
and they're hockey players and taking a lot of information

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,500
don't you everyone knows about heated rivalry i just haven't
watched it and it was like my first glimpse into heated

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,560
rivalry and then i just see them like fucking work like they
were like working out and like together and shit and then

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,460
they were working out yeah and then and at one they were
like in the locker room fully naked and everything and i'm

20
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:37,500
like stuffy what the it took paela's oldest time and then i
was like and i'm like trying to fix the server while i was

21
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,300
trying to rent the server by the way i accidentally bought
two servers because i was impatient um she was so distracted

22
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,820
i'm sure yeah yeah yeah so like obviously we couldn't do
like our own private server so i tried renting a server and

23
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,640
because we couldn't connect to each other like i had
everything i tried to prep everything beforehand but i just

24
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,720
forgot one thing and it was just stuffy just couldn't
connect to my server and i couldn't connect to her server

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,300
like that was just the one thing i just did not anticipate
happening um oh also i did turn down stuffy a little bit so

26
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:17,400
sound again let me know if it's better um testing testing am
i good don't you chat it's good for me too by the way you

27
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:26,560
guys yeah let me know if stuffy's okay um and then like i i
was at first i it on PayPal and then it was taking a while.

28
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,560
So like I was like, okay, let me just grab my credit card.

29
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,640
And then by the time I grabbed my credit card, put the
information down, the PayPal payment went through.

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,840
The moment I got everything, because I refreshed, I was
like, let me double check to make sure the PayPal payment

31
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,340
went through.

32
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,460
Because I waited like 10 minutes.

33
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,360
And then it went through the moment I typed in my credit
card information.

34
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
So now I have two hightail servers now.

35
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:01,340
I guess one of them i'll gift it to you guys you can go
fucking wild if you want um and then what else oh yeah and

36
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,480
then while i was like trying to get vox proximity mod to
work because all the other mods work we just had three mods

37
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,300
by the way i'll show you it's not that big of a thing it was
just like dumb mods um but the one mod that was not working

38
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,840
was the voice proximity mod and i was like trying to figure
out was like resetting my server and then i hear some very

39
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,160
suspicious noises on my second monitor.

40
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,540
Because obviously I wasn't tuned in to Heater Ravory while
trying to do tech support.

41
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,820
Yeah, that's why you kept messing up server setup.

42
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,260
Totally not because you were distracted.

43
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,700
And then, like, I heard some very suspicious noises.

44
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,720
I tad back into Snuffy's screen share.

45
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,160
And then I saw the two gay hockey players in a hotel room in
bed.

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,520
And I was like, oh!

47
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,540
Oh, they're finally i was like before that i was like when
the are they gonna man like i was just like bro they're just

48
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:06,360
we're all it's just all yapping when the are they gonna bang
and then at that point they were they were about to bang and

49
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,620
snuffy by the way was silent throughout all of this by the
way she was so locked in you were oh yeah yeah it's your

50
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:22,760
like morning coffee yeah what were you to say it was like
your fucking morning coffee yeah she was so locked in yeah

51
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:32,880
so um so anyway um they were getting at it while i'm like
freaking freaking out about voice proximity in my headphones

52
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:44,620
i just hear here two gay men getting the time of their lives
as my i guess my background just a little curious yeah and

53
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,440
then yeah and then he was like let me show you how it's done
i was like oh my god

54
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,340
i was like eating my popcorn during all of this i was just
like no way i can't believe he's actually gonna do this

55
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:10,780
episode i was like oh my god she's like oh i didn't even
check what the show was rated i just kept that up that was

56
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:19,680
that was not i know for certain that was not the first
episode i know for a fact that that had been the first

57
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:29,400
there's no way you just that was not the first episode stuff
either way it escalated i have no i have no way of verifying

58
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,760
because i've never seen another episode there's no way while
i was doing tech support you were doing your first watch of

59
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,300
heated rivalry in the background i didn't know i was gonna
be like a whole thing i was just like oh let me see what

60
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:50,100
this is all about wait and then you know it seemed like you
were so into it so apparently it is they fuck on the first

61
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,800
episode yeah okay yeah so yeah they didn't fuck on the first
episode it wasn't fucking it was like he was teaching him

62
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,960
something else he was yeah he was teaching he was teaching
him something else but it was not

63
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:19,380
you say what was it there was a a particular method the
grapefruit method yes so yeah he did it first to his senpai

64
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:27,660
and he like scoffed at him and he was just like hey not bad
for your first time and then he's like now let me let me

65
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:37,960
help let me show you how it's done they were so much louder
when he did it there was like no audio and the first guy did

66
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,200
it and then it got real like sloppy as my white noise while
i was trying to figure out how the fuck to get voice

67
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,400
proximity but it's okay it sounded like she was practically
pacing her room she's like i don't know if this is gonna

68
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,840
work i don't know why this isn't how do i enable pvp and i'm
just like this is freaking great it's like it's my breakfast

69
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:06,120
i was like okay i'm gonna try and do this now And then in my
background was just two closeted hockey players just having

70
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,180
the time of their lives, I guess.

71
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,520
Hell yeah.

72
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,020
Anyway, welcome to Hytale.

73
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,820
Sorry that we were there.

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,400
I really did want to get voice proximity to the work because
I thought it would be like pretty funny.

75
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Also, I don't know if we have PvP because I can't figure
this out at all.

76
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,040
It was like, look at configuration.

77
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:41,220
um there's the pvp enabled uh text on there and i looked at
it and i do not see no pvp text on there so um i guess we'll

78
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:49,980
see how i'll hit you and see if you take damage that's the
best i can do if i hit you first all right well let's see

79
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,120
what we okay we have to fight or flight instinct yeah i
didn't know there was pay to win cosmetics dude that's crazy

80
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:04,840

86
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:04,000

87
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,880
actually a mod for it to make it like i think i've seen more

88
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,880
yeah i saw someone was like we could put creepers i almost
downloaded creepers into our server i i was just like oh my

89
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:26,580

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,550
I get water floaters.

143
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,730
I won't drown.

144
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,970
They're going to be dripped out.

145
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,430
Wait, I need to put more accessories on.

146
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,610
Why are you so dripped out?

147
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,690
Okay, wait, wait.

148
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,130
Yeah, because I paid $60.

149
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,350
Oh, yeah.

150
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,410
That's why.

151
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,190
It's sort of like me.

152
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,210
Okay, I put stuffy down a little bit.

153
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,930
What chat, you hate me.

154
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,730
No, they don't, I hate you.

155
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,450
Okay, all right, all right.

156
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,330
That means I should just be louder than I'm going to turn my
own mic up.

157
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,610
Your enemies to lovers, you know, that's like, that's Eden
rivalry.

158
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,910
That's a cool one.

159
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,790
They literally, it's literally Team Russia versus Team
Canada.

160
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,470
Like, they literally, Russia literally took Alaska from us.

161
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,450
And it sold it to the United States.

162
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,770
That's what heated rivalry.

163
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,470
That's episode one of heated rivalry.

164
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,130
It starts sort of like the Fallout Alaska DLC.

165
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,590
Like, how dare you sell Alaska?

166
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,270
We shall solve this with hockey.

167
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,650
What's your room number?

168
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,710
I'm about to make you see what happens when you take Alaska.

169
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,590
Oh, what happens when you take Alaska?

170
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,630
Oh, what could you possibly do?

171
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,550
Oh, my God.

172
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,130
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

173
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,370
Does this hat, wait, this hat gives me ears.

174
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,930
Oh, it's a little short though for me.

175
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,610
Wait, I got some steel boots.

176
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,470
I got some knee pads.

177
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,850
So when I fall, I won't get hurt.

178
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,570
Oh, okay, no, you're right, bro.

179
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,090
This, I do not like it when he shows hurts his toes.

180
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,410
That ain't right.

181
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,930
What the fuck is this?

182
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,810
Oh, is this a cape?

183
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,690
Oh, my God.

184
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,130
Wait, that looks sick.

185
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,840
I feel like you're going to load up and be like a mall cop
or whatever.

186
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,940
Not a mall cop.

187
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,040
A mall samurai.

188
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,980
That's what it is.

189
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,720
Oh, you'll see.

190
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,840
You'll see.

191
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,140
You'll see.

192
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,400
All right, guys.

193
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,600
You're like your Naruto headband.

194
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,960
Your water floaties.

195
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,680
You're going to have some, like, a leather coat.

196
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,160
All right, guys.

197
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,620
Do I go?

198
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,040
Okay.

199
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,160
Oh, all right.

200
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,720
Wait.

201
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,560
Wait, which one?

202
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,280
Oh, all these cape looks sick.

203
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,540
Okay, guys.

204
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,140
One, two, three.

205
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,140
What are you counting?

206
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,340
Or you'll see.

207
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,860
You'll see.

208
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,020
You'll see.

209
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,840
One, two, or three.

210
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,440
Three?

211
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,180
Your abs?

212
00:17:59,380 --> 00:17:59,940
Yeah, I know.

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,780
It's sick, right?

214
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,620
Sick as hell.

215
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:02,920
Three?

216
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,940
I see more threes.

217
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,420
All right.

218
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,700
I think I'm good to go.

219
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,900
It was just no neck mean.

220
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
Okay, I like it with the neck.

221
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,340

Yeah, your kind teammates.

248
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,940
Epal.gg?

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,340
Just like PayPal.

250
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,260
Epal is a epal.

251
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Congratulations.

252
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,280
Your first order free.

253
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,200
Is this boosting?

254
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,260
Oh my god!

255
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,560
Do I look like I'm going to get boosted?

256
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,140
No, you look like...

257
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,800
I'm just looking for a duo queue.

258
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,360
So...

259
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,600
You mean DPS?

260
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,600
DPS.

261
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
DPS used to be eGirl.gg.g.

262
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,380
Where you could hire eGirls to play with you.

263
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,700
But they got a lot of flack for it.

264
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
So they renamed it as ePAL.

265
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,420
So they don't even boost you.

266
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,860
They probably like put you into the negatives.

267
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,840
I mean, they could bring a friend.

268
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,880
apparently you could bring a friend yes oh my god one bring
a guy and then the the guy that won't be in the car the guy

269

Wait, there's a structure over here.

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,900
That must be the main area.

314
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
Oh, yeah, there's bad guys over there, too.

315

Oh, I got an essence of life.

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,800
I don't want to know what that does.

335
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,560
You're going to need it after this guy.

336
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,780
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,380
Bam, bam, bam.

338
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,780
I think I just unlocked some sort of tech.

339
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,760
Yeah, look at this.

340
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,940
Oh, my God.

341
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,460
Look at this go.

342
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,540
Is this like, yeah, is this like Minecraft where you do
damage if you're in the air?

343
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,240
Yeah, yeah, like, be like, like the jump hit.

344
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,220
I don't think that worked, but he launched me.

346
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,340
Wait, what is that?

347
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,340
Oh, is that turkey?

348
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,480
Oh, it's a turkey!

349
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,320
I don't think they have hunger yet in this game, because
it's early access.

350
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,260
Oh, yeah.

351
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
Oh, my God, they look, they look like Casar eyes.

352
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,340
They look terrifying.

353
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,480
Oh, my God, he loves that.

354
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,140
He loves it when you hit him.

355
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,400
Whoa.

356
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,740
Did he?

357
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,040
No, I think you accidentally fed him something.

358
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,600
I didn't feed him anything other than this fucking right
hook.

359
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,440
Oh, my God.

360
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,800
I think he was saying he was like kissing his girlfriend.

361
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,600
Goodbye, dude.

362
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,980
He just ended this family.

363
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,800
It's just like, please tell my wife.

364
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,340
He was like, I'll draw aggro.

365
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,000
Wait, I can't hear anymore.

366
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,660
Wait, oh, oh, she just disappeared.

There's a main fortress over there.

369
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,340
I assume that's like where we have to go in general.

370
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,940

00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,890
I can't kill them.

441
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,130
They're fellow players.

442
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,950
And there's like little monies and little deos.

443
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,050

Wait, this is a no-kill zone.

447
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,270
My job is obsolete here.

448
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,990
What can I do if I can't kill?

449
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,030

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,950
Oh, my God.

451
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:52,950
What's the point?

452
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,050
We live in peace.

453
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,210
What's the point?

454
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,150
Oh, my God.

455
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:58,870
Oh, my God.

456
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,010
A traitor.

457
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:00,810
We...

458
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,130
This is a society, dude.

459
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,170
I mean, it's like a little...

460
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,030
It's a town.

461
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,610
Oh, my God.

462
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,970
What the fuck is wrong with you?

463
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,630
You can have a construction sign for a construction sign.

464
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:11,830
There was.

465
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,310
Spices, salt, dough.

466
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,570
Ooh, they have skill.

467
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,310
Oh, that's what life essence are for.

468
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,670
Oh, I see.

469
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,810
Essence of life.

470
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,770
You can't pick this up.

471
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,710
You can't pick it.

472
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,830
Yeah, I picked up an essence of life.

473
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,490
I don't know how I picked it up, though.

474
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,010
Stupid peace.

475
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,610
What the fuck am I going to do with peace?

476
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,520
Oh, sleeping is disabled because time is paused.

477
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,160
Will there never be a motorcycle?

478
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,100
is paused.

479
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,960
I think there's no night in here.

480
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,560
I think that's fucked up in general.

481
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,620
This is literally the best place ever.

482

You have unlocked the memories.

485
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,120

I don't think we can put stuff down, though.

547
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,080
No, we can't take anything for anything down.

548
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,460

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,640
You don't even care.

647
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,920
Free essence of life?

648
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,540
Oh my god.

649
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,200
Look at that.

650
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
You still want to trade...

651
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,240
Oh, they're like trading villagers.

652
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,000
They don't even give good shit, though.

653
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,720
Oh my god, look at these.

654
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,380
Oh my god, we have...

655
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,480
You don't even know!

656
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,660
What's this?

657
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,580
Okay, I'll build a big, strong house for you, my knight.

658
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,100
Oh, I have a little child.

659
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,540
No, Doki, please!

660
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,900
Not the children.

661
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,220
Where is she?

662
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,120
Oh my god, they're hiding in their homes.

663
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,240
They're on lockdown, dude.

664
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,100
Are they really locked down?

665
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:21,960
Where are they?

666
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,920
Where are the other villagers?

667
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,320
This guy is not leaving his house.

668
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,500
He saw what I did.

669
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,080
They're hiding from me now.

670
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,400
No witnesses.

671
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,940
Should we not live near these people?

672
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,820
I don't think they respawned.

673
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,500
I don't know where we could build a good house.

674
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,380
They're not all.

675
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:43,740
No.

676
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,400
There's like something cool over here.

677
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:45,640
Wait.

678
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,580
Oh my god.

679
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,280
There's a bed.

680
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,200
I stole one of your hat beds for myself.

681
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,780
What's your favorite part of the game so far?

682
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,760
I don't know.

683
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,700
No, I think the combat's fun.

684
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,820
The combat's pretty fun.

685
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,660
I haven't got even a combat weapon yet.

686
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,260
Don't worry, Kitson.

687
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,260
You don't need a fight ever again.

688
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:08,620
This game hurts.

689
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:14,050
I think I'm too, here's some Minecraft.

690
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,350
This is like, you're going to come in here expecting
Minecraft and then they're going to...

691
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,490
I mean, it feels like Minecraft.

692
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:31,650
terraria and minecraft that's how i feel it's like a 3d it
feels like 3d terraria i think wait game up a bit more okay

693
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:44,110
i'll put the game more i think the game itself is just like
pretty quiet yeah all right did you get did you hear if you

694
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:52,910
pick your nose there's more chance you'll get alzheimer's
what yeah i'm so gone there's no one of my memories so bad

695
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:59,670
dude there's like like the new a newest study came out like
recently where like people who pick their noses more will

696
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:08,370
most more likely develop alzheimer's what yeah why is it
because you're tickling your brain or something it's like

697
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:16,190
some i don't it was like a harvard study like recently a
harvard study yeah that's fucking hilarious what do you

698
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,150
think they study just like they invited a bunch of people to
like sit in a room and start picking their nose you pick

699
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:30,470
your nose yes don't lie yes i'm gonna go to this like mill
over here this looks cool we should live in the mill oh we

700
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:36,230
should we don't have to build stuff we can just live there i
want to sign up dude i literally think that all the time

701
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:41,890
whenever i hear about these studies is i'm constantly like
dude why did nobody ask me like i want to be of a study i

702
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:48,570

want to just be an organ donor i want to be a scientist too

703
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:56,990

that to be to be a subject no oh but you said you wanted to

704
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:08,070
be a scientist well like by association because i'm also
helping it's like being mojo jojo to like the professor he

And then, long story short, they refused to swap.

796
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,740
They did not refuse, but like three...

797
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,080
of the teammates ganged up on him being like yeah like we're
just gonna let her play widow um like and then he's like

798
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,280
please i really want to win this recall like i'm a broke
college student i really need the money so like the higher

799
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:35,140
placement you get the but then like and then the widow's
boyfriend i really need the money yeah yeah um it was like

800
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:41,000
really fucked up because um and like if you ever if you make
tweets about it you get like super engagement bait like

801
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,400
everyone who made ton of likes and retweets and everything
about it.

802
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,880
And, yeah, and also the Black Widow had 200 ping because she
was playing from Australia.

803
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,760
So, wait, did they carry?

804
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,460
The whole thing was they didn't want them to play Black
Widow.

805
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,160
He doesn't want her to play Black Widow.

806
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:00,800
Like, through?

807
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:07,080
He didn't want her to play Black Widow, so, like, the Black
Widow's boyfriend got him kicked out of the tournament

808
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,100
because he tattled on him.

809
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,980
He tattled on him to the tournament organizers.

810
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,880
He'd be like, Wait, wait, wait, what was the issue?

811
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,920
Like, what did he do?

812
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,220
They were trying to...

813
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,800
Okay, so, like, the most fucked up part was when my friend,
Moxie, he was, like, substituting for Kingsman.

814
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,520
Like, that's the guy.

815
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,100
The guy that got kicked out, his name is Kingsman.

816
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,380
And then he was...

817
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:27,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

818
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,760
Come here.

819
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,340
Really quick.

820
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,320
There's something in the distance.

821
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,060
What the fuck is that?

822
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,840
Is it flying towards us?

823
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,300
I don't know.

824
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:43,080
So what's fucked up was that my friend Moxie was the one
that was substituting for him.

825
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:55,400
and then is he getting closer no wait what the fuck is that
you yeah that's disgusting it looks like a beholder yeah it

826
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:01,400
looks like that dungeon dragon thing yeah yeah yeah and then
anyway and then i asked him i was like oh wait i thought you

827
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,900
weren't in the tournament like oh i didn't get invited to it
like how do you get in this last minute he's like oh i was

828
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:11,460
substituting for kingman because um apparently like he was
implying that he was like super he was like sexist or

829
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,540
whatever to the girls and now i was like oh that's sucks,
buddy.

830
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,440
Like, I mean, like, I was like, oh, that sucks, but at
least, like, you know, you get to play.

831
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,000
And he's like, yeah.

832
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,800
And then apparently, and then it got exposed that the girls
lied about him being sexist.

833
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,620
And he was actually just like, he got kicked out.

834
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah.

835
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,760
So like, I first while I was like, well, that's, that's
fucked up.

836
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,140
Like, why was he so sexist towards the women?

837
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,040
And then later on he made an expose video about the, his
team.

838
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:43,260
Like, like the day before the tournament, um, the day, yeah,
that's the thing that no one, like, no like no one really

839
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:50,060
knows about that i was told of um because like they were
like spreading rumors about kingsman and stuff because like

840
00:59:50,060 --> 01:00:00,140
that's what i thought happened at first because kingsman
didn't make his video yet and then um yeah and then he they

841
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:08,760
uh he made a video exposing the entire the not the entire
team but like half the team and basically um basically it

842
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:19,360
blew the first came out it had 40k views and now and now the
video has almost i think it's like 600k views the last time

843
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:29,080
i saw this was from two days ago this was two days ago by
the way this was this was two days ago and then yeah i was

844
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:36,680
like holy i dodged a bullet by not participating in that
tournament because my friend moxie was like oh yeah you want

845
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,240
me to get you in i can i can ask him to get you in i was
like no that's i was like no it's okay it's still last

846
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:51,060
minute i don't really want to join a tournament that last
minute and i'm like oh thank god i was so like half the

847
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:59,640
girls careers are basically over because what yeah because
every ending tournament the amount of times i can count

848
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:07,640
these on my fingers yeah it was literally a career ending
tournament like it was like like um it was really funny

849
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:15,720
because like um bulgar there's another tournament coming out
next week like that's going to be starting next week um and

850
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:22,260
then the tournament organizer it's called for those who
don't know it's boga bash too and then um and then uh boga

851
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:29,600
was like do you want to be captain and i was like no i i
want to avoid the cc i don't want to do a cc that's the

852
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:37,440
girl's name by the way the captain cost most of the drama
and i was like i don't want to do a repeat of that yeah i

853
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:47,600
was like no i i was like i would like to be a player i do
not i'm that's crazy what the hell and because like she was

854
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:57,700
also the girl she got twitch banned for a day like yeah
because she she said she said uh keep yourself safe but like

855
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:08,380
the actual the actual what do you mean keep yourself safe
the first yeah yeah but but not keep yourself oh my god i

856
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:19,000
was like that doesn't sound so bad why would she be in for
like yeah yeah yeah she said keep yourself safe but but not

857
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:32,160
but only the letters only the letters and she got she got
one day banned on twitch one day yeah that's crazy yeah and

858
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:39,440
she was like um i said it to my friend like and she kept
like she kept digging a d-pole and she was like um I said it

859
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:46,220
to my friend like I was trying to send that to my cat that
was not meant to be on stream and then Kingsman revealed

860
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:53,460
that the random person she said it to doesn't even know her
she was like I'm not even friends with this person what the

861
01:02:53,460 --> 01:03:02,920
fuck does she mean dude I'm convinced these tournaments are
some sort of like insane like it's like I used to do like

862
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:11,280
like twitch rival stuff and whatnot and I kind of got the
vibe that it can be super like unbalanced yeah because like

863
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:17,780
okay the whole thing was that yeah the whole thing was that
the girls were like we're just playing for vibes and then

864
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:27,140
the one guy was like bro i really want to win like this is
40 000 and then this is for fun like you don't and then the

865
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:38,540
team captain was like called him a broke loser and was like
yeah and i was like bro what like even for me dude what the

866
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,180
Yeah.

867
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,320
Yeah.

868
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,500
Like, even for me, like, I...

869
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,760
Yeah, what were you going to say?

870
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:44,840
No, you first.

871
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,660
I'm going to have to watch the critical video.

872
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,460
Oh, you got to watch the video.

873
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,920
I watched all the videos because I was, like, there on
ground.

874
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,780
Like, not ground zero, but I was there on day one.

875
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,360
Oh, my God.

876
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,000
Wait, did you get...

877
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,580
You, like, like, lost the round and you didn't go to, like,
day two or something?

878
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:03,860
No, no.

879
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,640
Like, as in, like, my friend was supposed to be in the...

880
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:12,420
like my friend substituted for the guy that got kicked out
so that i was like so caught up on like and then i asked him

881
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,720
why he was something and then so then he was like oh yeah
like this is what they told me and i was like dude what the

882
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:26,120
i thought what the why is your sexist yeah and then later i
found out the girls were just spreading rumors why would you

883
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:37,260
even get so serious for like a like a freaking marvel rivals
stream tournament like that's crazy that's crazy actual like

884
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:43,380
ranked and stuff yeah like because it was like it's like a
lot of money for these people too so but it's like it's

885
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:51,920
crazy because it's like um um i the tournament organizer was
like to the guy that got kicked out he was like why are you

886
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,420
like do you care about money so much just go pro like why
the fuck are you like this is a creator tournament for fun

887
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:04,180
why are you participating and i'm like a creator hosted
tournament no it was like it was hat like there was like

888
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,320
some pro players in there and like some creators.

889
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,500
So it was like it was like 5%, 5 to 10% pros.

890
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,200
Oh yeah, like the nonsense type tournament.

891
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:18,260
Yeah, but then it'll be it's like very skewed on like the
thing is like pros barely make any money too.

892
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,500
So it's like that's just some what was the money reward on
this?

893
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,140
Also I'm sorry, I'm like enraptured by the detail of those.

894
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,800
Are you seeing those?

895
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:39,320
So like first place each player gets $3,000 which is a lot
for like a college student and like for five five people or

896
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:47,520
was it or six like split like um it's i don't remember it's
like three times six so each player themselves gets 3k oh

897
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:54,120
it's like every everyone gets paid for the tournament but
like first though that doesn't even seem like a ton like am

898
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,800
i crazy like i thought if you get first in those tournaments
it's like big money i think like three days a lot for like a

899
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:07,840
college student though in general is it really i mean yeah
that's like half of tuition isn't it that's half of tuition

900
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:16,000
that's that's still a lot yeah it's a lot i don't know i
feel like i mean i don't know i guess if you're if you're if

901
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,540
you play marvel rivals tournaments for money there's got to
be other opportunities for that not a lot for like i mean

902
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:29,760
like for like a big tournament you guys like like i said i'm
used to twitch rivals they always But those are like smaller

903
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,900
creators though.

904
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,140
That's the thing.

905
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,440
Twitch rivals, they only invite the big creators.

906
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,400
So like this guy was like a really small creator.

907
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,480
Because it was like 70% were like smaller creators.

908
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,840
And like 30 were like the big ones.

909
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:54,440
So like for me like I would for me it would be like I would
always forget about cashing in the money.

910
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,340
Because I'm in so many of these tournaments.

911
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,340
I don't know if you joined like non-twitch rivals, but
there's like so many forms You gotta like fill out and then

912
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:14,800
like tax forms etc to like get your money I've ever done
like a non-twitch tournament type thing but like I always

913
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:22,620
still try like no matter what In the tournament I still like
flex whatever they need me to play and I still try But it

914
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:29,540
was like crazy because like the the like three four of them
three or four of them were like just playing for fun it's

915
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:43,200
just for vibes so now it's a meme now they're like yeah
they're just like oh no are you gonna play for vibes okay i

916
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,120
gotta i gotta remember now if people say i'm just playing
for vibes i'll be like i know i know the reference now no

917
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:56,860
it's crazy it actually broke mainstream it like people
around like everywhere people who don't even play rivals are

918
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:04,920
talking it and the thing is the guy i think i saw like the
yeah the tweet like somebody tweet criticals video and

919
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:14,120
they're like this the you know the situation is crazy or
whatever yeah and now so i guess yeah that makes sense yeah

920
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:21,240
and like it's crazy because like because like the guy the
guy that got kicked out he he streamed for like the first

921
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:28,620
five minutes of his stream he he basically made 3k because
everyone was just donating and subbing to him and then like

922
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:35,740
apparently today he had 25k people watching him it was this
like very small streamer too he was like a he didn't even

923
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:48,200
have twitch partner at that time damn yeah so like they were
harassing him yeah the girls were harassing him oh what the

924
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:57,000
hell yeah because like because all he wanted he was just
trying to get her to get her to stop playing widow um

925
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:04,800
because he was like for a more winnable team invite more
winnable team fight you gotta stop playing and he's like and

926
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:12,860
he's like a rank one in that magic player anyway they could
have gotten bag yeah and then anyway so i got invited to a

927
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:18,040
tournament for next week for the boga bash too i might ask
boga i was like oh do you have because he announced this

928
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:22,560
other tournament and i was like oh do you still have stats
he's like oh i can make you a captain I was like, I do not

929
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,160
want to be in it.

930
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,540
But then he was like, oh, it's okay.

931
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,040
I'll give you, we're going to be assigning pro players.

932
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:32,200
So like during drafting, when we're drafting players, like
you can ask them to draft the players.

933
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:39,460
And I was like, oh, so like if I fuck up the drafting, I can
just blame the pros.

934
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,120
Because I was like, oh, God, zero kills five deaths, zero,
six in that match.

935
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,260
Oh my God.

936
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,240
Yeah, I could be like, I didn't pick this team.

937
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,740
players, pro players picked it.

938
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,120
I'm zero accountability.

939
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,800
I don't know what I'm doing.

940
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,960
Oh my god, that's crazy.

941
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,460
Especially because it wasn't even like, like I could
understand especially like if it was, because I only know

942
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:11,640
Twitch rivals, which is sometimes like, yeah, they can,
like, sometimes it's like good for content, you know, it's

943
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,720
not too sweaty, even though like pros get invited.

944
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,140
It's not, it's, it's mostly like a stream event.

945
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,760
It's like, no, but it's always like one, the two teams.

946
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,500
Invitational tournament.

947
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,980
It's always, but there's always, like, one to two teams that
try to, that are, like, super stacked, though.

948
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,560
Also, we should actually...

949
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:27,980
Hold on, wait.

950
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,660
I'm going to grab this bit.

951
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:30,600
I'll be right back.

952
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,480
Oh, you're going to get a drink?

953
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:31,480
Hold on.

954
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,300
One sec, chat.

955
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,220
No problem.

956
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,020
All right, anyway, so...

957
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,600
I put all my stuff in this chest, by the way.

958
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,200
Oh, wait.

959
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,100
Is this our new house?

960
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,960
I just figured we could live in here.

961
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,100
It's kind of chilling, right?

962
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:41,380
Yeah, yeah.

963
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:42,500
This is a good place to live.

964
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,860
You don't want to craft a chest, too.

965
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,060
Yeah, crafted chest.

966
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,540
I'm going to try and get a workbench and I'm back, but I'm
just...

967
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:49,800
Oh, I have a workbench already.

968
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,280
Yeah, I'll just put it here, then.

969
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,860
Oh, yeah, I'll put it here.

970
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,260
And then, can we stack chest or no?

971
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:58,720
I wonder.

972
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,260
Oh, we can.

973
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,080
Okay, that's good.

974
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:03,200
All right.

975
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,340
Oh, yeah, no.

976
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,060
It's crazy.

977
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:14,820
The drama is so crazy that, like, a basketball, like, what
is it, the Atlanta basketball team tweeted, like, made a

978
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,740
TikTok about it.

979
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,420
And also, like, I was talking to one of my friends.

980
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:25,240
Apparently, he was at the hospital getting something checked
out.

981
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:30,840
And, like, while he was in the waiting room, while he was in
the waiting room, people were, like, on their phones

982
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,260
laughing about the...

983
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:35,580
Laughing about the fucking Marvel Rivals drama.

984
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,060
And I was like, holy shit.

985
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:40,560
That's how mainstream it has become.

986
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,480
I was talking to Kony, and he was like, he doesn't give a...

987
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,820
Like, all he does, he plays...

988
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:50,040
He, like, play... He does play Rivals, but even he was like,
Okay, Doki, did you hear about the rival's drama?

989
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,380
And I'm like, the Kingsman video has 1.2 million views.

990
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,340
Guys, I saw that video when it was 40 KVs.

991
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,220
Yeah, it fucking went mainstream.

992
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:03,020
No, there is no way any of these girls can have a career
again.

993
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,580
There's no way.

994
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,040
Even then, like, if people see them in game, people are just
going to throw their games.

995
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:17,580
And then the tweet about, like, they set back women in
gaming sphere by 100 years.

996
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,720
I was like, no!

997
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,340
I'm just like, no!

998
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:42,510
No, I think, I think the most fucked up part was that one of
the girls that threw him under a bus was his consistent rank

999
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,030
duo.

1000
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:47,410
I was like, how the fuck did you not defend him?

1001
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:50,190
Like, I would be so fucking mad.

1002
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,230
I always defend my duos.

1003
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:58,010
And I'll be, like, so fucking mad if, like, my rank duo did
not defend me in the...

1004
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:58,370
Oh, yeah.

1005
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,910
Oh, my God.

1006
01:12:59,150 --> 01:12:59,230
What?

1007
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:06,750
I was telling them how, like, one of the girls that was in
that drama was, like, the guy's duo partner in rank.

1008
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,930
And she, like, threw him under the bus, too.

1009
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:12,130
Dude.

1010
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,190
I was like, that's fucked up.

1011
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,250
Like, how do you play with this person consistently?

1012
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:20,270
Like, he, like, literally boosted you, and you can't even
defend him.

1013
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,830
They don't know what it's like to be a professional e-pal, I
guess.

1014
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,850
Yeah, I was like, I was like, how could you not defend your
e-pal?

1015
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:33,110
That's so messed up.

1016
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:34,670
What do they think was gonna happen?

1017
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,370
I thought, and they thought that they were, like, the guy
wouldn't make a video about it.

1018
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:41,230
Like, he would just, like, suck it up and shit.

1019
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,470
Good on them for sticking his guard, though.

1020
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:45,150
Yeah.

1021
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:50,950
Because, like, at first, like, at first, like, his friend
was, like, don't make a video about it.

1022
01:13:51,430 --> 01:14:00,530
up and go next and then he and then he made a video yeah go
next dude just suck up three thousand dollars just go next

1023
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:06,890
you didn't lose anything of value i think if he never made
that video he would he would have like um because like i

1024
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:12,170
because like you know the girls were telling rumors that he
was being super sexist towards them and like because like

1025
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:18,010
that's what i heard the day before the tournament and so if
he didn't drop because i heard about it and it was like it

1026
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:23,070
was like it was because like um that's what i was told
because i was like whoa you're subbing in for him what

1027
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:28,230
happened and then and then the guy dropped the video and
everyone like found out that like they were spreading like

1028
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:41,750
false rumors yeah do they get their money well i don't know
if the others got their money i just also think like i i i

1029
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:51,770
like i don't know i like i just think the tournament itself
was very poorly organized in general damn i don't know if i

1030
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:59,950
saw anybody playing on the tournament this is why i can't
trust any women now i'm upset it's okay don't worry i'm your

mad, you can just ride them.

1034
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:22,610
You don't need a saddle?

1035
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,530
Oh my god, this one has beautiful hair.

1036
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,550
You also killed, they'll like run away, I think.

1037
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:30,490

hair.

1038
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,410

01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:33,870
Get over here.

Nice.

1041
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:38,190
Did they have like a defensive?

1042
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,350
I don't think I can just run.

1043
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:44,270
Can I?

1044
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:48,370
The cows were like kicking me, so I just wanted to know if
they have like a kick button.

1045
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:54,850
i don't think so i think they they'll kick oh i think like
they don't really do any i think because it's early access

1046
01:15:54,850 --> 01:16:01,890
all you can do is just ride it i keep walking in the
buildings and it just is work in progress with the hale it

1047
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:07,790
is early access i thought the way everybody was enjoying
this game there has to be some sort of content maybe i'm

1048
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:14,050
just getting like well there is a lot of content you just
gotta like it we just gotta leave here like advance to

1049
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:23,730
somewhere yeah because there's like a lot of like regions
and stuff but it like i think people like it more when it's

1050
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:32,390
like early access you know like i mean i when they play a
super modded version of this to give more content i guess

1051
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:41,170
wait what's that is that lobster a lobster as a lobster and

Give me just hide and meet.

1069
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:18,300
I mean, hide is pretty.

1070
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,700
Like, meet is pretty good.

1071
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,620
But I'm going to start.

1072
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,040
I didn't even see what we could craft yet.

1073
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,200
When we needed, like, did you have...

1074
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,680
Did you do an axe or no?

1075
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,400
Yeah.

1076
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,220
I don't have an axe.

1077
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,940
Yeah, I don't have a hatchet.

1078
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,420
I only have a...

1079
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,120
I only have a pickaxe.

1080
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,580
I was like, what's the opposite of it?

1081
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,120
An evil spider.

1082
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,180
I can start mining.

1083
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,240
I'm mining.

1084
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,460
I'm mining.

1085
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,180
The wolves have swapped.

1086
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,980
I'm poisoned, actually.

1087
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,120
Wait, where did you go?

1088
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:55,920
Oh, I see you.

1089
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,100
Okay, that's me.

1090
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,540
You're over there.

1091
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:04,840
I'm by the horses.

1092
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,780
You're over there.

1093
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,840
Is this game like Minecraft where we're supposed to go
deeper?

1094
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,300
exploration, I'm pretty sure.

1095
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,300
Oh, I can make a...

1096
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,540
Oh, I have a campfire.

1097
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:24,980
We can, uh, we can, uh, light our, make our meat.

1098
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,800
Well, now it's raining, so how are you gonna light it?

1099
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,500
It's fine.

1100
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,580
It doesn't follow its Minecraft rules.

1101
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:31,660
It's high-tail rules.

1102
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,960
Oh my god, the clouds look kind of scary.

1103
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,340
It looks like someone just smudged a, like, texture in
Photoshop.

1104
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,680
Yes, yeah.

1105
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,160
I need to make more.

1106
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,460
Yeah, you should cook some meat.

1107
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:52,850
Deeper can have new lures, but it's more influenced by
further biomes.

1108
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:54,890
What do I get?

1109
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:56,630
Oh, I can pick it up.

1110
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:57,310
Okay, nice.

1111
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:58,770
I mean, we could dig down.

1112
01:19:59,050 --> 01:19:59,670
Let's do it.

1113
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,470
I might dig straight down.

1114
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:03,910
What's the worst that could happen?

1115
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:09,490
A giant hole opens up below you and you fall to your death.

1116
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,170
There's no way they have lava.

1117
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:14,090
I think you're already too deep for me to commit,
unfortunately.

1118
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:26,450
no jump jump down i'll catch you i'll catch you i'm gonna
take straight dad oh god here hold on don't worry my queen i

Yeah, but we're stuck here together.

1137
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:21,670
Oh my god.

1138
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:23,990
I can't go down any further.

1139
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:24,990
It's not letting me.

1140
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:25,670
Wait, no it is.

1141
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:26,530
No, it is.

1142
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,930
What are you talking about?

1143
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:39,130
This looks like the scene from...

1144
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:39,870
What was that?

1145
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:42,890
Competitive heed or something?

1146
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:46,070
Heated rivalry?

1147
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:49,630
Competitive seed?

1148
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,510
What the fuck are you?

1149
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:56,930
Can you craft a new pickaxe?

1150
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,450
Alright, don't worry, I got you.

1151
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:00,890
I'll craft another pickaxe for you.

1152
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,710
Okay, and this POV is crazy.

1153
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:09,450
Don't worry, don't worry, my kid, and I'll craft you another
pickaxe.

1154
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,410
Just give me a sec.

1155
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:12,890
Are you going back up?

1156
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:16,970
Take take your time out.

1157
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:17,690
What the?

1158
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,310
I'm just a rat in a cage.

1159
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:26,870
There's no way I can get out now.

1160
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,650
I guess you got a dig down.

1161
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:34,530
You put so many above me.

1162
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:35,950
I've been sentenced to death.

1163
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:40,310
I guess I guess you got a dig down.

1164
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:43,690
I might dig straight down.

1165
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:46,390
Dude, I...

1166
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:50,430
I feel like a mole person now.

1167
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:51,510
My eyes are bad.

1168
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:53,870
I can't do anything other than dig in my tunnels.

1169
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,570
I don't hear any other voices.

1170
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:58,990
I see the light.

1171
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:00,050
Oh my god.

1172
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,130
Wait, I see the light.

1173
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,830
Yeah, you...

1174
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,990
You used me as like a booster seed.

1175
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:10,770
And now I'm literally buried under your 20 blocks of
cobblestone.

1176
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:20,390
I see the light She's gonna build up I'm definitely I think
I'm not pretty sure This is more than 20 blocks I'm pretty

1177
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:28,710

1183
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,310
Chad, should I keep digging down or should I just like go
left or right?

1184
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,430
Keep digging down, I'll save you.

1185
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,890
I just want to know what happens when you can't dig down
anymore.

1186
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,850
Are you able to dig down with just your, like, hands?

1187
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,830
Maybe it's more beneficial than the broken pickaxe, right?

1188
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:36,850
No.

1189
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:37,350
Oh, shit.

1190
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:40,870
Really?

1191
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,050
What are the rubble?

1192
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:42,910
Oh, there it is.

1193
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:43,430
Wait, is that?

1194
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:44,150
What is that?

1195
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,190
How do you even get a torch?

1196
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,430
It's so dark.

1197
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:54,590
What do I do?

1198
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:55,770
Yeah, you can dig your hands.

1199
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:56,950
You can dig your hands, Snuffy.

1200
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:57,950
No, I cannot.

1201
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:01,690
Okay, come down here and try and dig up some volcanic
bubbles through your hands.

1202
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:02,730
They said it's possible.

1203
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:06,750
I believe.

1204
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:07,990
I believe in my chat.

1216
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:43,770
I'm actually taking down that brightened up material for two
more to pick axes.

1217
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:47,490
It says you're 70 meters away from me.

1218
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,670
If you were above me, there would be zero.

1219
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:52,370
Yeah, I'm right here.

1220
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:53,850
I'm right here right now.

1221
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,710
You have gotten two meters close.

1222
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,750
And I'm getting two meters close again.

1223
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:03,390
Oh, my God.

1224
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:04,130
Look, see?

1225
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:08,310
Chad, I don't think there's anything that happens when you
dig straight down in high tail.

1226
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:09,830
There is.

1227
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:11,190
There has to be a cave.

1228
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:15,310
I think I think we were very unlucky.

1229
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:18,470
There must be a cave down there.

1230
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:19,670
What's the point?

1231
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:22,870
There's always a cave.

1232
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:23,730
You gotta be patient.

1233
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,890
I just you gotta be patient.

1234
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:30,190
Look see I'm almost there stuffy.

1235
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,370
I'm tired boss.

1236
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:35,570
I'm real tired.

1237
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:37,450
Well, that's too damn bad.

1238
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:38,750
You gotta keep digging.

1239
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:41,310
No!

1240
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:48,010
99% of miners quit before they hit the cave.

1241
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:54,090
I don't think I'm ready to see light again when the hole,
like, finally opens right there again.

1242
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,250
Wait, temple gateway?

1243
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:59,950
Wait, that's where the portal was.

1244
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:00,770
Oh, that's the portal?

1245
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:01,610
Oh, okay, never mind.

1246
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:04,110
But I see you.

1247
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:05,910
Wait, really?

1248
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:10,740
Where am I?

1249
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,340
Wait, do I see you?

1250
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:18,240
Wait, where are you?

1251
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,060
I see light.

1252
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,240
I told you!

1253
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:22,500
Parish!

1254
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:26,840
Oh,

1255
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:46,900
shit, I'm taking all of the cobblestone and I'm getting the

She didn't even know what we're looking at right now.

1311
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:06,930
I wish you could see it, Doki.

1312
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:09,130
I wish you could see all the stuff I'm seeing right now in
this hole.

1313
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:10,670
It's okay.

1314
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:11,570
I have an idea.

1315
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:14,190
Maybe if you duo queued with me, you would have been able to
see it.

1316
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,370
But you're just gonna solo queue.

1317
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:20,250
That's right.

1318
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,290
I'll be making a video about this.

1319
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:24,150
Not until I make it first.

1320
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:34,520
I am in a cave now.

1321
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:34,900
Oh.

1322
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,080
Okay, chat.

1323
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,500
Wait, are you actually in a cave?

1324
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,880
Wouldn't you like to know?

1325
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:43,560
Okay, then I won't tell you.

1326
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,000
I won't tell you what I've just found.

1327
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:46,320
Well, too bad.

1328
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:49,840
I really wanted to show you this thing I found, but too bad.

1329
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,360
I guess you'll never know.

1330
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:53,220
You'll never know this cool thing I found.

1331
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,100
Oh, guess who was back at home?

1332
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,200
Maybe I'll see it under the earth.

1333
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,160
I've been above ground before.

1334
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:00,960
I've seen all there.

1335
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,280
I'm gonna eat my dinner right now while you suffer in that
cave.

1336
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,800
I'm gonna get water and then eat my dinner while you're
stuck in that cave.

1337
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:08,420
Yeah, sure you are.

1338
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,440
At least I get to see the sunlight.

1339
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,640
I'm gonna be right back.

1340
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:12,300
I'm gonna get water.

1341
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,340
Well, let's see.

1342
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,200
Let's see how you do without iron, huh?

1343
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,460
Because I hit the mother load.

1344
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,640
Wouldn't you like to know weather, girl?

1345
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,520

Wouldn't you like to know, weather boy?

1347
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,060

Dude, wait, okay, glowing, glowing moss or mushrooms or
something?

And this time it's glowing gold.

01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:49,760
It kind of reminds me of your beautiful hair, Doki, if only
you could have seen it.

1351
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:58,580

01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,450
Oh my god, never mind.

Why are there void bad guys?

1425
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:58,950
That's new.

1426
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:00,550
Because they're protecting the portal.

1427
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:02,550
There's no portal.

1428
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:03,350
Yes, there is.

1429
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:03,810
What the fuck?

1430
01:43:03,870 --> 01:43:05,850
I'm literally in the portal right now.

1431
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:06,730
What?

1432
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:09,870
Yeah, jokes on you.

1433
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:13,090
You missed out on some sick-ass portal action.

1434
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:15,290
Are you in heaven?

1435
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:18,290
Yeah.

1436
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:22,670
Because they accepted me there, unlike some other people.

1437
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:24,690
He looks so fucking sad.

1438
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,230

Oh, hey, look at that.

How did you enjoy your heaven experience?

1442
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:37,570
Wow, I guess they accepted me and not you.

1443
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:40,250
I guess you were turned away from the gates.

1444
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:42,890

I'm doubting it.

1447
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:49,150

You.

1488
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:50,560
Little thief.

Oh, someone should have been faster.

01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:56,700
You're too slow.

1492
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,900
One raccoon who's swiping quicker.

1493
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:01,740
I guess you're just a little too slow.

1494
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:04,240
Can I pick up the old arrow?

1495
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:07,140
Sort of.

1496
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,180
I'm not coming to...

1497
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:09,500
Let's go explore the cave.

1498
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,600
I mean, that's like the one thing we haven't done yet.

1499
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:14,480
Okay.

1500
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:19,420
What's that?

1501
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:21,380
That's my reaction to that information.

1502
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,320
Wait, come on, Snuffy.

1503
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,620
We haven't gotten a chance to go to the cave yet, Snuffy.

1504
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,000
Oh, my God.

1505
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:34,400
I wonder what is to see.

1506
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,840
Wait, where is that hole?

1507
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:38,400
It was like this way, right?

1508
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:38,780

01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:50,000
Alright.

1512

Okay, cool.

I don't think so.

1533
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:38,240
Could we make a skull throne?

1534
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:40,140
Oh my god, I want to make a skull throne.

No PvP.

1549
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:16,850
You can just launch me to my death.

1550
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:17,770
Oh, my God.

1551
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:19,850
Wait, wait, wait.

What is this?

1553
01:50:20,670 --> 01:50:21,350
It's white.

1554
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:23,630
God damn it.

1555
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:24,810
No.

1556
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:27,170
I got to take a beating.

1557
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:28,490
Oh, I think it's iron.

1558
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:29,650
What is the yellow stuff?

1559
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:31,790
Oh, that was copper this whole time.

01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:32,430
Oh, my God.

1561
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:33,290
I was playing Minecraft.

1562
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:34,410
Daddy's angry.

1563
01:50:37,190 --> 01:50:38,630
Wait, watch out, Daddy.

1564
01:50:39,090 --> 01:50:40,790
There's some bad guys behind you.

1565
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:43,730
Don't worry, Daddy's got this.

1566
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:45,370
Oh, my God.

1567
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:48,010
I will need you to light the way, though.

1568
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:48,930
I can only...

1569
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:49,710
Okay, okay, yeah.

1570
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:50,950
There's nothing up here.

1571
01:50:50,970 --> 01:50:53,010
Actually, I can swap.

1572
01:50:53,150 --> 01:50:54,310
You can launch me that far?

1573
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:55,650
Oh, you're right.

1574
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:56,790
Do you need help?

1575
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:58,150
My kid is...

1576
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:04,090
Dude, there's more rats than there's like a spider.

1577
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:06,710
I swear, I've never seen zero spider.

1578
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:07,930
Wait, maybe down here?

1579
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:10,110
Come down here.

1580
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:11,250
Okay.

1581
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,720
Oh, it's going deep.

1582
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:18,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1583
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:20,130
Find it.

1584
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,200
Wait, what's that?

1585
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,460
Are you just the boom mushrooms?

1586
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:26,360
Oh.

1587
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:29,360
Yeah.

1588
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:32,240
Oh, this is going deep.

1589
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:37,210
Yeah, this is a...

1590
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:38,950
What is Doki's slapshot?

1591
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:39,730
What does that mean?

1592
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:40,790
Her slapshot?

1593
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:41,550
What?

1594
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:42,290
My what?

1595
01:51:46,350 --> 01:51:50,910
We have not seen a single spot, yet there's so much webs.

1596
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:52,530
Wait, what's this?

1597
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:54,650
Blue cave moss.

1598
01:51:57,470 --> 01:52:00,030
This is a deep-ass tunnel, I will say.

1599
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:00,670
Like, cave.

1600
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:04,750
Did you run through here already?

1601
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:05,350
Yeah, I ran.

1602
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:06,610
I just zoomed through.

1603
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:11,110
I was hoping to find something new, but...

1604
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:13,250
Oh, there's a lot of ore here, though.

1605
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,050
Oh, there's emerald.

1606
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:16,850
Is that emerald?

1607
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:23,290
Orium ore?

1608
01:52:23,490 --> 01:52:24,770
What the fuck is that?

1609
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:29,570
Orium ore?

1610
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:30,370
Yeah.

1611
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:37,350
Uranium.

1612
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:38,930
Yeah, is that fucking uranium, dude?

1613
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:39,230
Oh, my God.

1614
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:39,690
Can we make it?

1615
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:42,710
Yeah, I was gonna say everyone make a fucking bomb.

1616
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:45,050
Let's take it to heaven

1617
01:52:48,850 --> 01:52:58,190
Let's end this you and me and my nuclear bomb Let's see your

1618
01:52:59,290 --> 01:53:01,410
Oh my god, we still keep going down.

1619
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:03,670
It still goes down.

1620
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:08,010
Well, I'll wait for you Do you have a favorite Minecraft
song?

1621

01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:13,970
Which one?

1623
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:16,490
It's like, chat, what song is that based off of?

1624
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:17,710
It's just like...

1625
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:21,050
I might dig straight down.

1626
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:23,710
Oh, I thought you were thinking about, like...

1627
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:25,130
What is it?

1628
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:26,370
The digging song?

1629
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:27,950
How did that go?

1630
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:31,150
Remember the digging song?

1631
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:32,170
Straight down.

1632
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:32,770
Hold on.

1633
01:53:34,710 --> 01:53:35,650
That was a classic.

1634
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:36,210

Can you listen to songs?

1638
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:45,570
Not, I can listen to it, but then my chat won't hear it.

1639
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:46,830
Oh, really?

1640
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:47,730
Yeah.

1641
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:51,090
I don't know if this is copywritten because it's like a
Minecraft song though.

1642
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:53,250
Right?

1643
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:54,170
So it works.

1644
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:57,230
On fourth and I'm digging a hole.

1645
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:58,530

01:53:58,990 --> 01:53:59,250

You see my torch?

1661
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:53,910
No.

1662
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:55,150
I went straight down.

1663
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:57,790
You went straight down.

1664
01:54:58,330 --> 01:54:59,730
I might be lower than you.

1665
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:02,030
No, I'm pretty sure you're above me.

1666
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,030
Yeah, I know.

1667
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:08,370
You're definitely above me.

1668
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:09,570
No way.

1669
01:55:10,290 --> 01:55:11,750
There's nowhere to go down.

1670
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:14,030
I'm such a noob.

1671
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:15,830
Are you going down or up right now?

1672
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:17,490
I'm going left and right.

1673
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:18,810
There's no down or down.

1674
01:55:19,110 --> 01:55:19,430
All right.

1675
01:55:19,690 --> 01:55:20,910
You're going further away.

1676
01:55:21,190 --> 01:55:22,350
Literally, you're further away from me.

1677
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:23,510
These guys kind of look like you, chat.

1678
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:25,370
They look like my curators.

1679
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:26,990
These little grubs.

1680
01:55:29,330 --> 01:55:30,430
Yeah, no, you're above me.

1681
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:33,150
You're above because I went down and you got further away.

1682
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:36,430
I found uranium.

1683
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:39,950
What the hell?

1684
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:42,210

Doki, wait, come back to me.

1690
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:23,020
I found something critical.

1691
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:26,900
Wait, I found some things, Doki.

1692
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:28,120
I found some things.

1693
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:29,160
I think I'm...

1694
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:34,660
Doki, I found two separate things of interest.

1695
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:37,340
I found some things, too.

1696
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:38,620
What did you find?

1697
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:42,380
Are you by the fortress or by the...

1698
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:45,340
Oh, I'm by the great...

1699
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,680
Oh, I do not like this place.

1700
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:49,480
The great?

1701
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:49,900
What?

1702
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:50,480
Where are you?

1703
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:54,000
I found a spider's nest.

1704
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:55,620
Wait, what?

1705
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:56,440
Where are you?

1706
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,380
I do not like that.

1707
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:58,060
Up or down?

1708
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,240
You gotta be up, dude.

1709
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:00,520
No, no, no, no.

You're gonna...

1711
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:06,820
Oh, you're 33 meters away from me.

1712
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:10,500
That could be, like, distance.

1713
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:12,320
I found the spider.

1714
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,500

01:58:33,370 --> 01:58:34,730
What the fuck is that?

1729
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:37,050
This guy's throwing fucking bombs.

1730
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:39,730
Wait, are these bad?

1731
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:44,610

Boom!

1733
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:51,870
Oh, and I kill the crab with me.

1734
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:55,590
Alright, I'm heading back.

1735
01:58:55,710 --> 01:58:58,190
You're killing crabs, and I'm down here in the mines.

1736
01:58:58,510 --> 01:59:00,510
I still don't know how to respawn in the bed.

1737
01:59:00,690 --> 01:59:01,930
I slept in the bed.

1738
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:05,230
It didn't let me respawn.

1739
01:59:05,390 --> 01:59:06,090
I don't understand.

1740
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:08,470
I kept my creepy skull heads, at least.

1741
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:10,510
That's a plus.

1742
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:10,910
I don't know.

1743
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:12,450
I don't know how to respawn.

1744
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:13,830
Maybe it's like a server problem.

1745
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:16,190
There's a bear.

1746
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:18,110
Holy crap, an iron helmet.

1747
01:59:19,370 --> 01:59:20,590
Whoa, upgrade.

1748
01:59:21,710 --> 01:59:23,870
It looks like I'm really in business now.

1749
01:59:26,670 --> 01:59:27,530
Okay, Bear is gone.

1750
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:28,150
Bear is gone.

1751
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:29,130
I am safe now.

1752
01:59:29,650 --> 01:59:31,490
I still have to claim your bed.

1753
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:32,770
I did claim my bed.

1754
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:34,490
I slept on it too.

1755
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:36,390
I don't remember seeing you claim your dang bed.

1756
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:38,270
I literally slept in front of you.

1757
01:59:38,410 --> 01:59:39,110
What do you mean?

1758
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:42,750
We looked each other in the eye when we went to bed.

1759
01:59:43,210 --> 01:59:45,150
I was enraptured by my own feet.

1760
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:45,790
I'll be real.

1761
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:55,930

It'll just take me a while.

2509
02:58:33,880 --> 02:58:35,560
My horse has buns for stamina.

2510
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,960
I'm like watching you slowly get closer to me on my map.

2511
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:40,160
Oh.

Ah, she's shy.

2518
02:58:53,500 --> 02:58:56,200
I've decided to close my map.

2519
02:58:58,340 --> 02:59:02,080
Don't worry, I'm watching your items despawn in real time.

2520
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:04,880
Oh, this is definitely the hell you were talking about.

Yeah, that looks like Upper Hell.

2523
02:59:09,080 --> 02:59:10,980
I think Madden made it a lot better than...

2524
02:59:11,900 --> 02:59:14,640
Maybe I should have gone the peaceful forest way again.

2525
02:59:14,700 --> 02:59:15,540
This looks crazy.

2526
02:59:15,640 --> 02:59:17,140

03:02:40,990 --> 03:02:41,470
That's me.

2568
03:02:42,510 --> 03:02:43,710
Oh, there's like a hell of a...

2569
03:02:43,710 --> 03:02:44,730
No, that's me right there.

2570
03:02:45,350 --> 03:02:46,090
You not see me?

2571
03:02:47,210 --> 03:02:48,210
Are there to see you?

2572
03:02:48,770 --> 03:02:49,610
What am I doing?

2573
03:02:50,070 --> 03:02:51,370
How many fingers am I holding up?

2574
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:53,090
You're holding, like, zero fingers?

2575
03:02:53,210 --> 03:02:53,810
That's a lie.

2576
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:56,470
That's a trick question.

2577
03:02:56,650 --> 03:02:57,650
You were holding zero fingers.

2578
03:02:57,850 --> 03:02:59,110
I had to shoot my iron helmet, though.

2579
03:03:00,690 --> 03:03:02,270
Wait, there's blue gems!

2580
03:03:02,550 --> 03:03:04,330

That's why I'm being flippant all over the place.

03:04:01,690 --> 03:04:04,070

Is that the Among Us song?

2603
03:05:49,770 --> 03:05:49,950
Yeah.

2604
03:05:51,190 --> 03:05:52,010
It's sus.

2605
03:05:52,510 --> 03:05:54,230
I never realized there was a song.

2606
03:05:54,590 --> 03:05:56,230
I feel like I already forgot about that.

2607
03:05:56,650 --> 03:05:58,070
Like it was ages ago.

2608
03:05:58,150 --> 03:06:00,870
Yeah, it feels like 20 years ago when Among Us was...

2609
03:06:00,870 --> 03:06:03,210
You know the Among Us TV show still hasn't come out yet.

2610
03:06:03,230 --> 03:06:03,910
That's crazy.

2611
03:06:04,830 --> 03:06:07,290
I forgot they were gonna make the Among Us TV.

2612
03:06:07,290 --> 03:06:10,110
Yeah, that's been in development for so fucking long.

2613
03:06:10,250 --> 03:06:10,690
But they got...

2614
03:06:12,650 --> 03:06:13,830
We're fine, right?

2615
03:06:14,990 --> 03:06:15,390
I'm...

2616
03:06:15,390 --> 03:06:15,410
Yeah.

2617
03:06:17,230 --> 03:06:21,350
Elijah Wood is like one of the voice actors, too.

2618
03:06:21,670 --> 03:06:22,370
Wait, what?

2619
03:06:22,470 --> 03:06:22,870
Yeah.

2620
03:06:23,410 --> 03:06:24,570
We got the Lord of Rings.

2621
03:06:24,630 --> 03:06:26,930
We got the Lord of Rings guy.

2622
03:06:27,150 --> 03:06:28,830
Did you hear he's like a DJ, though?

2623
03:06:29,130 --> 03:06:30,170
He's a fucking...

2624
03:06:30,170 --> 03:06:31,650
Okay, to be fair, he has Lord of Rings money.

2625
03:06:31,730 --> 03:06:32,870
He can do whatever the fuck he wants.

2626
03:06:33,110 --> 03:06:33,470
I know.

2627
03:06:33,570 --> 03:06:34,750
That's pretty awesome, though.

2628
03:06:35,210 --> 03:06:39,370
Every time someone fucking watches, does a marathon of Lord
of the Rings, this guy gains like $1,000.

2629
03:06:40,170 --> 03:06:40,790
$1,000.

2630
03:06:41,110 --> 03:06:48,250
that he doesn't have like lord lord of the ring royalties he
must know there's no fucking way he doesn't get roy they're

2631
03:06:48,250 --> 03:06:55,830
had he must have got royalties from that that's not how
movies work yes it is you get paid royalties like a

2632
03:06:55,830 --> 03:07:04,550
commercial yeah for like dvd sales and stuff every time
somebody buys like a magic or streaming services i'm pretty

2633
03:07:04,550 --> 03:07:11,710
sure because like it depends under contract but i'm pretty
sure because like um because that's what daniel radcliffe

2634
03:07:11,710 --> 03:07:17,370
has that's why you could do whatever the he wants because he
has like harry potter royalties i thought he does a bunch of

2635
03:07:17,370 --> 03:07:24,250
other acting jobs yeah no but he does indie films yeah but
he does gonna be a different harry potter but he does indie

2636
03:07:24,250 --> 03:07:32,010
films because he made so much money from harry potter that
like um he could just do roles that he wants to do type deal

2637
03:07:32,010 --> 03:07:36,490
well now he's gonna lose his royalties because they're
changing Harry Potter.

2638
03:07:36,650 --> 03:07:39,110
So I feel like it's like, it's like all the scams are now.

2639
03:07:39,130 --> 03:07:40,490
Yeah, but I think he was just actors.

2640
03:07:41,050 --> 03:07:43,150
I feel like he already invested most of his money.

2641
03:07:43,470 --> 03:07:45,690
Yeah, they're probably definitely fine.

2642
03:07:46,070 --> 03:07:46,350
Yeah.

2643
03:07:47,190 --> 03:07:48,230
It's usually royalty.

2644
03:07:48,450 --> 03:07:48,750
Really?

2645
03:07:49,410 --> 03:07:52,170
I thought they just get offered like a comically large jack.

2646
03:07:52,170 --> 03:07:54,010
I think like nowadays they don't act.

2647
03:07:54,410 --> 03:07:58,150
Nowadays they don't do royalties because the royalties are
pretty shit because of streaming.

2648
03:07:59,570 --> 03:08:02,410
Because streaming, you don't get much from streaming.

2649
03:08:02,870 --> 03:08:03,350
But back then...

2650
03:08:04,850 --> 03:08:12,470
like if it plays on tv yeah but like in streaming services
like you normally get like jack now but like back then for

2651
03:08:12,470 --> 03:08:19,530
dvds and stuff like and you get a lot and like movie like
you know how back then people like tv when tv was still a

2652
03:08:19,530 --> 03:08:30,610
thing they did like rebroadcast of the movies tv was still a
thing oh good tv is dead yeah tv is very dead i don't know

2653
03:08:30,610 --> 03:08:31,770
who i guess like the old

2654
03:08:34,850 --> 03:08:36,650
people that had the old ones

2655
03:08:41,180 --> 03:08:55,970

playing never gonna give you up um i'm gonna play the

2658
03:09:21,660 --> 03:09:22,620
Oh my face.

2659
03:09:25,980 --> 03:09:27,620
Oh my god, that's Undertale, right?

2660
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:28,620

2661
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:29,900
All my fellas?

2662
03:09:30,160 --> 03:09:30,460
No?

2663
03:09:30,840 --> 03:09:31,460
Oh yeah.

2664
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:32,240
What?

2665
03:09:35,960 --> 03:09:37,680
Is that Undertale?

2666
03:09:38,100 --> 03:09:39,260
Is that...

2667
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:42,520
What's this?

2668
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:47,960
I made a bed.

2669
03:09:53,190 --> 03:09:53,870
There's some song.

2670
03:09:53,990 --> 03:09:55,310
I'm like, what the fuck is that?

2671
03:10:04,850 --> 03:10:07,230
Oh, there's so many chests in here and stuff.

2672
03:10:07,750 --> 03:10:08,190
Oh, yeah, no.

2673
03:10:08,730 --> 03:10:11,730
I've, I've, I've sat, like, ate all of that and shit up.

2674
03:10:11,810 --> 03:10:12,750
There's stuff in it, though.

2675
03:10:13,430 --> 03:10:16,490
No, there's some stuff that, like, I use as, like, my junk
chest.

2676
03:10:17,650 --> 03:10:19,010
That's not what that is.

2677
03:10:19,570 --> 03:10:21,250
No, no, there's my junk chest.

2678
03:10:23,190 --> 03:10:24,490
Oh, my God, I like this song.

2679
03:10:33,870 --> 03:10:36,150
Oh my god.

2680
03:10:36,150 --> 03:10:39,270
Oh my god.

2681
03:10:39,770 --> 03:10:40,990
Oh my god.

2682
03:10:44,170 --> 03:10:50,470
I feel like my elbow is so deep, you can't even hear it.

2683
03:10:51,750 --> 03:10:54,050
My lady, shall I serenade you?

2684
03:10:54,370 --> 03:10:56,730

Oh my god, a piano.

03:11:04,810 --> 03:11:12,510

so you go you go yeah yeah um so now snuffy it played snow

2845
03:26:37,330 --> 03:26:41,910
brick first and then my my turn snuffy was like the guinea
pig before

2846
03:26:46,170 --> 03:26:51,870
i literally watched your youtube video and i was like
shaking my head like she learned she did better than the bad

2847
03:26:51,870 --> 03:27:00,250
day because she's so much dead body on the floor staff
because we share the same staff there's not just the manager

2848
03:27:00,250 --> 03:27:09,950
but we also have like the silent team is also um helping her
out so so um it's not just our our manager we have like two

2849
03:27:09,950 --> 03:27:16,070
what was a two or three other more staff members helping
stuff yeah and and stuffy was first for the snowbreak

2850
03:27:16,070 --> 03:27:21,330
because i had a little busier schedule so they're like oh
yeah we can yeah my schedule He's busy doing it.

2851
03:27:22,950 --> 03:27:29,210
So, so I, my, my sponsor stream was, that's why my sponsor
stream was like a week later.

2852
03:27:31,550 --> 03:27:37,030
And then, so, so they're like, they wanted a video upload
first for Snuffy.

2853
03:27:37,530 --> 03:27:37,630
Yeah.

2854
03:27:37,810 --> 03:27:38,090
Yeah.

2855
03:27:38,510 --> 03:27:42,390
And yeah, cause like, our sponsor editors are also the same.

2856
03:27:42,770 --> 03:27:47,830
So that's my, the editors that work for the sponsor videos
also edit for Snuffy as well.

2857
03:27:47,850 --> 03:27:48,910
You got the same editor too.

2858
03:27:48,910 --> 03:27:49,830
That's crazy.

2859
03:27:51,170 --> 03:27:56,050
oh my god i'm just shaking my head like so you guys they
learned

2860
03:28:00,490 --> 03:28:11,210
damn and then and then so everyone thought it was okay so
that's why like they uploaded the video they uploaded the

2861
03:28:11,210 --> 03:28:19,550
video on stuffy's channel because like the sponsor was like
don't worry be fine it'll be fine it looked fine i mean my

2862
03:28:19,550 --> 03:28:24,450
biggest gripe is that you can upload that to youtube and
youtube will just be like awesome yeah and then when you

2863
03:28:24,450 --> 03:28:34,290
finally click go live suddenly it's like actually i hate
that in your band what happened after you uploaded it yeah i

2864
03:28:34,290 --> 03:28:39,650
like had it uploaded for like 24 hours on my account and it
wasn't until i published it when it was suddenly like i'd

2865
03:28:39,650 --> 03:28:47,790
take it back this is this is filth and scum get out so then
and then she got She got, like, a fucking strike on her

2866
03:28:47,790 --> 03:28:48,270
channel.

2867
03:28:48,450 --> 03:28:50,250
And I was like, oh, no.

2868
03:28:50,810 --> 03:28:52,350
Dude, chat, those are bad.

2869
03:28:52,630 --> 03:28:53,810
Like, getting a strike sucks.

2870
03:28:54,350 --> 03:28:54,590
Yeah.

2871
03:28:54,850 --> 03:28:55,770
Super sucks.

2872
03:28:56,110 --> 03:28:57,150
Yeah, because you have three strikes.

2873
03:28:57,390 --> 03:29:03,590
But luckily, we found out that it goes away if you don't do
anything bad for three months.

3003
03:37:22,840 --> 03:37:24,240
I didn't go any further here.

3004
03:37:24,580 --> 03:37:24,780

3040
03:40:04,070 --> 03:40:06,990
I lost everything but 100,000 pieces of sand.

3041
03:40:09,130 --> 03:40:10,350
You gotta go back.

3042
03:40:12,190 --> 03:40:13,150
No, not...

3043
03:40:13,150 --> 03:40:13,630
No!

3044
03:40:14,270 --> 03:40:15,810
At least you got the sand, though.

3045
03:40:16,350 --> 03:40:17,770
You know, at least you get to keep the sand.

3046
03:40:18,010 --> 03:40:19,810
I think we got flipping plenty of sand.

3047
03:40:20,030 --> 03:40:21,510
We're literally in the sand pits.

3048
03:40:21,970 --> 03:40:22,670
Oh, fuck out.

3049
03:40:22,750 --> 03:40:23,630
Okay, well, you know what?

3050
03:40:24,230 --> 03:40:26,110
It's just good to get the damage out early.

3051
03:40:26,270 --> 03:40:27,490
Where did we die?

3052
03:40:27,750 --> 03:40:28,930

3053
03:40:28,930 --> 03:40:38,970

Are you actually getting going to get your stuff back?

3061
03:41:13,470 --> 03:41:17,650

03:52:04,820 --> 03:52:13,340
weird i didn't it's like it's like the 3d stuff yeah i like
liked it and then i just didn't like it as i yeah and then i

3200
03:52:13,340 --> 03:52:19,620
think the only thing i liked about the 3d uh i never played
it but i saw like videos of it was the the sarcophagus

3201
03:52:19,620 --> 03:52:27,440
pokemon and he was just like yeah yeah and he was just like
fucking running at you with his hands oh yeah animation for

3202
03:52:27,440 --> 03:52:36,380
that she was crazy I feel like I played that one but I don't
remember I'm gonna have to look that up I'm trying to farm

3203
03:52:36,380 --> 03:52:45,860
people like there was never a remaster there was a remaster
it was for the switch yeah people are in denial they're

3204
03:52:45,860 --> 03:52:54,780
coping yeah it was like it was cool but they changed like so
much of it so it was sort of like a reboot i heard like a

3205
03:52:54,780 --> 03:53:02,740
lot of remasters they make it easier to make the game easier
and stuff i kind of liked how punishing that game yeah like

3206
03:53:02,740 --> 03:53:09,040
you know like the monster house oh my god that would just
end around instantly yeah and then you would get another one

3207
03:53:09,040 --> 03:53:16,980
right after the first one yeah and then my my solution when
a monster i just i i kill off one of my teammates but i can

3208
03:53:16,980 --> 03:53:22,060
go back in the tunnel that's that's You wouldn't just get,
like, teleported away.

3209
03:53:22,260 --> 03:53:25,000
You'd step on, like, the warp pad and then just be like, oh,
that's true.

3210
03:53:25,420 --> 03:53:26,500
And you teleported away.

3211
03:53:26,620 --> 03:53:26,900
Oh, yeah.

3212
03:53:26,900 --> 03:53:33,540
And then you're, like, there's no, there's no, like, um, uh,
like, tunnel that you can just, like, hole yourself in.

3213
03:53:33,660 --> 03:53:34,800
Wait, where the fuck did you go?

3214
03:53:35,900 --> 03:53:37,120
I'm right outside.

3215
03:53:37,300 --> 03:53:39,760
I went back really quick to get the seeds because I'm going
to start.

3216
03:53:40,160 --> 03:53:41,820
Wait, I got to make a watering can.

3217
03:53:42,320 --> 03:53:43,740
Oh, oh, you're going to farm?

3218
03:53:44,020 --> 03:53:45,400
Wait, I have seeds, too.

3219
03:53:46,980 --> 03:53:47,600
Yeah, yeah.

3220
03:53:47,760 --> 03:53:49,180
I took some from the chest.

3221
03:53:50,200 --> 03:53:52,140
Oh yeah, I have a...

3222
03:53:52,140 --> 03:53:53,780
I have a turnip seed bag.

3223
03:53:56,440 --> 03:53:59,380
I think we need to start actually farming.

3224
03:54:00,600 --> 03:54:01,460
That's what I'm doing.

3225
03:54:01,660 --> 03:54:02,820
What do you mean, silly?

3226
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:05,120
I realize that we lack food.

3227
03:54:07,060 --> 03:54:08,660
A lot of food.

3228
03:54:10,540 --> 03:54:12,720
Don't worry, I know how to survive in this wilderness.

3229
03:54:13,020 --> 03:54:13,840
Wait, where are you?

3230
03:54:17,280 --> 03:54:18,860
I'm crafting a watering can.

3231
03:54:20,360 --> 03:54:20,860
Downstairs?

3232
03:54:20,960 --> 03:54:21,540

03:56:20,760 --> 03:56:21,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3255
03:56:21,600 --> 03:56:22,000

Wait, wait.

3267
03:57:27,460 --> 03:57:28,740
Oh, I'm eating my wheat.

3268
03:57:28,880 --> 03:57:29,380
Never mind.

3269
03:57:30,280 --> 03:57:32,340
JK, I thought I could plant this.

3270
03:57:33,000 --> 03:57:35,280
I think you could just probably plant it in the grass?

3271
03:57:36,800 --> 03:57:38,240
Probably not even plant this.

3272
03:57:42,830 --> 03:57:44,010
That's harvested weed.

3273
03:57:44,670 --> 03:57:45,330
You hooligan?

3274
03:57:46,510 --> 03:57:47,370
Wait, what the fuck?

3275
03:57:47,510 --> 03:57:48,350
It started growing.

3276
03:57:48,490 --> 03:57:50,470
Wait, if you just spam it, does it just grow?

3277
03:57:51,530 --> 03:57:56,550
I don't... Do you think that's just over time, or are you,
like, gaslighting me into thinking that I can never stop

3278
03:57:56,550 --> 03:57:56,830
watering?

3279
03:57:56,930 --> 03:57:59,450
Look, you spammed it, and it just started growing really
fast.

3280
03:58:00,270 --> 03:58:01,170
You're doing it.

3281
03:58:03,450 --> 03:58:04,870
No, I was just gaslighting you.

3282
03:58:04,910 --> 03:58:06,170
I wanted to see if you'd do it.

3283
03:58:06,510 --> 03:58:11,330
I'm squirting my can as hard as I can.

3284
03:58:12,810 --> 03:58:15,190
I don't like the way it just squirts out like that.

3285
03:58:15,310 --> 03:58:16,990
I can't just do, like, a long stream.

3286
03:58:17,570 --> 03:58:18,550
Wait, it did work!

3287
03:58:18,690 --> 03:58:19,230
Wait, what?

3288
03:58:19,230 --> 03:58:33,350

not just tab no because it did those out of order see i told

3289
03:58:33,350 --> 03:58:44,290

i'm like look look look oh my god i did that wait keep keep

3290
03:58:44,290 --> 03:58:49,810

bigger wait no you're not i don't think you're it, right?

3291
03:58:50,450 --> 03:58:51,610
I don't know how to water it.

3292
03:58:51,710 --> 03:58:53,330
I'm just kind of, like, spraying it.

3293
03:58:55,370 --> 03:58:57,130
Oh, it's time and water.

3294
03:58:59,390 --> 03:59:00,610
So water does help.

3295
03:59:00,970 --> 03:59:01,230
Yeah.

3296
03:59:05,200 --> 03:59:07,320
That's a weird-ass watering animation.

3297
03:59:08,320 --> 03:59:09,640
It's really uncomfortable.

3298
03:59:10,800 --> 03:59:12,420
I'm, like, shaking one out.

3299
03:59:16,180 --> 03:59:17,720
Chad, is there magic in this game?

3300
03:59:17,820 --> 03:59:18,800
Can I tell you spells?

3301
03:59:19,040 --> 03:59:19,440
Come on.

3302
03:59:19,540 --> 03:59:19,860
What?

3303
03:59:19,860 --> 03:59:20,880
There's magic, apparently.

3304
03:59:21,080 --> 03:59:22,820
Like, we gotta level up more, though.

3305
03:59:23,120 --> 03:59:24,260
We gotta have more memories.

3306
03:59:24,640 --> 03:59:28,160
I don't even know where it's the closest portal for us.

3307
03:59:28,800 --> 03:59:29,560
Oh, there is.

3308
03:59:29,900 --> 03:59:29,900
Oh, there is.

3309
03:59:29,900 --> 03:59:30,480
On the map.

3310
03:59:30,540 --> 03:59:32,080
I mean, we go to the...

3311
03:59:32,080 --> 03:59:35,280
Before we go, let's go cherish some memories.

3312
03:59:36,360 --> 03:59:37,540
It's like, follow me.

3313
03:59:37,660 --> 03:59:38,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3314
03:59:38,360 --> 03:59:41,480
Yeah, yeah, let's deposit some memories real quick.

3315
03:59:43,620 --> 03:59:45,560
We picked our nose sufficiently now.

3316
03:59:45,680 --> 03:59:47,120
It's time to say goodbye to these memories.

3317
03:59:48,820 --> 03:59:49,280
Goodbye.

3318
03:59:51,080 --> 03:59:51,940
That's crazy.

3319
03:59:52,340 --> 03:59:54,160
Can you link me that study?

3320
03:59:55,800 --> 03:59:57,560
Are you, are you like fucking paranoid now?

3321
03:59:57,680 --> 03:59:58,900
You're like, oh shit.

3322
03:59:59,480 --> 04:00:01,760
I was always wondering why I don't have good memory.

3323
04:00:02,060 --> 04:00:05,180
It's gotta be because I don't pick my memory.

3324
04:00:05,300 --> 04:00:06,440
There's like some inflammation shit or something.

3325
04:00:06,880 --> 04:00:07,420
Always this way.

3326
04:00:07,960 --> 04:00:14,120
That's like crazy to me because it must actually mean that
like people are like digging in their brain hole.

3327
04:00:16,680 --> 04:00:17,340
What the fuck?

3328
04:00:17,420 --> 04:00:18,060
Oh my god.

3329
04:00:18,460 --> 04:00:20,000
Oh that's what was shooting me.

3330
04:00:22,920 --> 04:00:24,640
Oh, there's some hyenas here.

3331
04:00:25,260 --> 04:00:27,000
Oh my god, you're getting chased by a pack of hyenas.

3332
04:00:27,260 --> 04:00:27,660
That's okay.

3333
04:00:28,980 --> 04:00:30,300
I'm built different.

3334
04:00:30,560 --> 04:00:31,940
Shoo-mah-on.

3335
04:00:34,140 --> 04:00:34,760
There you go.

3336
04:00:36,200 --> 04:00:38,840
Oh, and apparently, next patch, they're adding necromancy.

3337
04:00:38,920 --> 04:00:39,440
That's cool.

3338
04:00:40,220 --> 04:00:40,660
What?

3339
04:00:40,840 --> 04:00:41,360
That's fucking sick.

3340
04:00:41,360 --> 04:00:43,160
I want to do that shit.

3341
04:00:43,400 --> 04:00:44,600
Bro, I'll wait for the next patch.

3342
04:00:46,180 --> 04:00:47,540
I mean, we have the server for a month.

3343
04:00:48,900 --> 04:00:49,260
Hell yeah.

3344
04:00:49,440 --> 04:00:50,620
I want to try the magic.

3345
04:00:50,740 --> 04:00:51,500
That sounds cool.

3346
04:00:51,780 --> 04:00:52,420
All right, we have...

3347
04:00:52,440 --> 04:00:53,400
Oh, I think that's this.

3348
04:00:53,500 --> 04:00:55,620
We have alchemist's workbench now.

3349
04:00:57,140 --> 04:00:59,820
Oh, I didn't realize this actually had purpose.

3350
04:01:00,100 --> 04:01:00,640
Be real.

3351
04:01:02,000 --> 04:01:03,940
Yeah, we have the alchemist workbench.

3352
04:01:04,240 --> 04:01:05,040
That's fun.

3353
04:01:05,380 --> 04:01:06,380
I had lots of fun.

3354
04:01:06,900 --> 04:01:07,440
I didn't know.

3355
04:01:08,420 --> 04:01:08,940
Unlocked.

3356
04:01:08,940 --> 04:01:09,760
Oh, you go there.

3357
04:01:10,540 --> 04:01:11,140
Look at the chest.

3358
04:01:12,340 --> 04:01:12,980
It shows you.

3359
04:01:14,740 --> 04:01:15,780
Decorative chests.

3360
04:01:16,120 --> 04:01:17,020
Morph potion.

3361
04:01:17,260 --> 04:01:17,980
Eternal seed.

3362
04:01:21,140 --> 04:01:22,420
Oh, the next one.

3363
04:01:22,440 --> 04:01:23,600
patches this weekend.

3364
04:01:24,020 --> 04:01:24,600
That's fast.

3365
04:01:29,060 --> 04:01:31,440
That's really fast if it's the next patch.

3366
04:01:31,820 --> 04:01:33,360
You can make teleporters too.

3367
04:01:33,600 --> 04:01:34,720
Oh yeah, I saw that.

3368
04:01:35,460 --> 04:01:35,620
Okay.

3369
04:01:36,540 --> 04:01:36,940
Cool.

3370
04:01:39,060 --> 04:01:40,420
That's fun though.

3371
04:01:40,900 --> 04:01:45,780
It definitely feels more like Terraria than Minecraft in my
opinion.

3372
04:01:46,180 --> 04:01:48,800
I don't think I can ever think of Terraria in a 3D scenario.

3373
04:01:48,960 --> 04:01:50,480
To me, this is definitely Minecraft.

3374
04:01:51,360 --> 04:01:53,300
This is definitely just Minecraft.

3375
04:01:53,860 --> 04:02:00,760
Terraria, if it was 3d only because of how detailed some of
the stuff is especially with like the different types of

3376
04:02:00,760 --> 04:02:09,120
weapons you can use like the that's true I do think like the
armor too the armor tiering reminds me of Terrarium it's

3377
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:17,060
like palladium and shit yeah yeah but that was fun exploring
I feel like we didn't explore that much too but we already

3378
04:02:17,060 --> 04:02:23,380
like encountered a lot of shit I didn't know what to expect
I didn't know how much content this game had already but the

3379
04:02:23,380 --> 04:02:29,720
fact that it showed me another never patched this weekend
too for even like the fact that the patches are coming out

3380
04:02:29,720 --> 04:02:36,440
really fast as well yeah that's really cool i'm not i'm not
used to games up dude like updating like i was gonna say up

3381
04:02:36,440 --> 04:02:46,040
duty yeah because everyone's for the gold yeah is that is
that i think it's crazy stuck in a hole for 30 minutes yeah

3382
04:02:46,040 --> 04:02:54,720
we didn't miss out on some cool things i would never i guess
i'll never see the dwarf lair the dwarf castle oh yeah you

3383
04:02:54,720 --> 04:03:01,420
never got to see the yeah the molten sword zombie that was
pretty sick yeah you would have known those frogs were not

3384
04:03:01,420 --> 04:03:08,280
to be fucked with as well i didn't i i was like what are you
doing and he fucking sucked me in and i was like oh that

3385
04:03:08,280 --> 04:03:17,060
what you do he sucked us both yeah and like back when they
were like when the game first came out like when people

3386
04:03:17,060 --> 04:03:24,180
could access it, they're like, oh, it's early access, it's
very early access, guys, so please don't judge it too hard.

3387
04:03:24,820 --> 04:03:25,820
But it's surprisingly a lot.

3388
04:03:25,820 --> 04:03:26,540
Like this game right now?

3389
04:03:26,800 --> 04:03:27,060
Yeah.

3390
04:03:27,460 --> 04:03:32,720
They were like being like, guys, we're sorry that it's like
very early access or there might not be, there's not a lot

3391
04:03:32,720 --> 04:03:33,440
of content.

3392
04:03:33,660 --> 04:03:36,040
But I feel like there was a lot of content.

3393
04:03:36,040 --> 04:03:39,280
There was a lot of content locked behind that $60 price tag.

3394
04:03:39,720 --> 04:03:39,860
Yeah, there was.

3395
04:03:40,260 --> 04:03:40,280
Yeah.

3396
04:03:41,660 --> 04:03:42,780
Looking at you?

3397
04:03:43,740 --> 04:03:44,180
Yeah.

3398
04:03:44,300 --> 04:03:45,080
I mean, look at me.

3399
04:03:45,360 --> 04:03:45,800

future but i know i definitely thought this was gonna be

3403
04:04:12,240 --> 04:04:19,840
like a roblox game i mean that in the best with thought it
would be more like not a ton of content i guess you know
