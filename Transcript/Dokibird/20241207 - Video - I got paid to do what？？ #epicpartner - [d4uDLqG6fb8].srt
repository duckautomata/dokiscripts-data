2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,100
The theme for chapter 6 is Japan themed.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,780
Because there's a lot of like...

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,860
The new map itself has like new locations where you're fighting like...

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,700
Demons and stuff which looks really cool.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,680
So like they have this new area.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,020
This area there.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,040
Which is like...

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,660
They're like mini boss fights.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,960
This is what the boss fight looks like that...

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,600
It's so cool.

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,860
Where is she?

13
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,580
Yeah, she has a gun.

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,880
I'm shooting her.

15
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,000
Frosty, I need you to help.

16
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,420
Okay.

17
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,260
Frosty.

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,500
Frosty, where is he?

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,520
That's fine.

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm stuck.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,580
Frosty, I'm stuck!

22
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,900
Okay, nice.

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,040
A Night Rose.

24
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,040
And then like...

25
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,060
He's gonna pick her up.

26
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,440
And you gotta shoot the eye.

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, wow!

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,180
Can I shoot from the back?

29
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,560
Oh.

30
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,360
And then you gotta shoot her from here.

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,900
Frosty!

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,660
I can't shoot at him!

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,340
Oh, I can.

34
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,060
Nevermind.

35
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,980
I can shoot the back.

36
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,960
I didn't realize that.

37
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,180
It's fine, Frosty.

38
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,760
I'm helping.

39
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,160
Shoot her!

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,180
Nice, we did it.

41
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,000
Yoink.

42
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,240
What's this?

43
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,300
Oh, no!

44
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,640
This...

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,680
This one's really cool.

46
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,680
This one's really cool.

47
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,480
And then I do that.

48
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,680
And then I go...

49
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,320
Oh, wait.

50
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
And then I go...

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,880
That's what happens.

52
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,440
It's a portal.

53
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,020
Wait, what's over there?

54
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,120
Oh, that's another boss fight!

55
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,880
We can take him!

56
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,460
Let's get this boss fight.

57
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,100
Oh f- It's okay.

58
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,120
Oh, there's a portal too.

59
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,780
There's too many elemental!

60
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,780
You can return them to their home, but you don't have to do that.

61
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,580
Okay.

62
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,280
Don't worry, we got this.

63
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,460
We got this, Frosty.

64
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,220
Oh my God!

65
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,480
Is he

66
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,540
gonna...

67
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,500
Over here.

68
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,850
No!

69
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,250
I messed up!

70
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,750
No!

71
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,310
I messed up!

72
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,970
I messed up!

73
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,310
I got scared!

74
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,410
No, I couldn't use the...

75
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,370
Elemental.

76
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,930
But like...

77
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,450
Wait, that's sick.

78
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,750
I think like, my favorite one was...

79
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,710
My favorite- Oh my God.

80
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,210
Oh wait, that's not the element.

81
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,530
Oh, it's a sticker!

82
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,270
Oh, that's- She's cute though.

83
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,630
I also really like their original skin too.

84
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,290
Their original skins are really cool as well.

85
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,170
Oh, and then this is the Night Rose!

86
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,010
This is the lady that we eliminated earlier.

87
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,130
Wait, what's this?

88
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,230
Is this like the...

89
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,230
Oh, it's a backpack.

90
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,190
Wait, is this like...

91
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,430
Oh.

92
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,030
The puppet dance.

93
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,450
Yeah, she's the boss girl!

94
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,050
Sorry, what's the last one?

95
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,710
The tactical Night Rose.

96
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,330
I wonder if they have the...

97
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,150
Oh, they're...

98
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,250
Oh, is this the glider?

99
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:17,830
Oh!

100
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,450
Okay, that's sick.

101
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,890
That's a sick glider though.

102
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,010
Oh my God!

103
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:23,730
Yes!

104
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:24,990
Okay, wait, wait.

105
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,790
Oh my God.

106
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,330
Now, I have anime on my side.

107
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,210
Oh my God, this is good.

108
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,010
This is good.

109
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,870
This is good for us.

110
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,930
Like, what am I supposed to do in this situation?

111
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
Oh my God.

112
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,350
What am I supposed to...

113
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,570
That's right.

114
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,470
Yeah!

115
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,460
We need to get a better car.

116
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,860
I want a sicker car.

117
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,960
I ask and I receive.

118
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,480
There we go.

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,400
Alright, guys.

120
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:04,980
Come on.

121
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,260
Get in here.

122
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,900
Oh, there's a bike next to me too.

123
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,980
We can be like...

124
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,700
Like a bodyguard in the president.

125
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,660
Fill your shield?

126
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,160
No.

127
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,520
Okay, let me chug jug.

128
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,540
I want a Victory Royale.

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,720
That was a cool car earlier.

130
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,060
He ruined it.

131
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,040
He overwrote the trip.

132
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,140
No, he could have just ran.

133
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,820
Oh my God.

134
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,520
You could have ran.

135
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,740
Weak.

136
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,500
I miss.

137
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,930
Oh, shit.

138
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,210
Oh, it's still a car!

139
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,490
Bro, no!

140
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,890
I still got him!

141
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,670
I still got him!

142
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,690
No!

143
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,130
It's still a car.

144
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,450
Guys, we're gonna work together, okay?

145
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,970
Guys!

146
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,390
In the spirit of Fortnite Chapter 6, eliminate the boss together.

147
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,810
Somehow, everybody's gonna work together and fight...

148
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,270
Oh my God.

149
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,710
Maybe there's too many people.

150
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,290
Oh my God.

151
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,970
And if you don't fight, you're gonna get killed.

152
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,910
If you find a gun, use your fists, okay?

153
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,690
I bet we can melee her.

154
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,870
Guys, I don't even think we need a gun.

155
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,270
Guys, let's all go in and start meleeing.

156
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,630
Let's all go in.

157
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,150
Screw it.

158
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,230
Guys, melee!

159
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,750
God, not me!

160
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,310
Okay, guys, we're gonna work together.

161
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,310
Oh my God!

162
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,850
Alright, we did it, guys!

163
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,310
Look at that.

164
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,390
Zero crowns.

165
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,390
Alright, make a circle.

166
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,290
Make a circle, dragons.

167
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,810
Take your gun out.

168
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,310
Find one person you want to shoot at.

169
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,630
And when I say...

170
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,250
When I shoot my gun, you shoot at that one person that you pick.

171
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,070
That one target you pick.

172
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,870
Alright?

173
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,290
Three.

174
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,650
When I shoot my gun, you shoot at them.

175
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,390
At one target you pick.

176
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,200
Guys.

177
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,300
Guys.

178
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,320
Oh, I silenced her.

179
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,000
Sorry, that was an accident.

180
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,140
Sorry, I have to go to the other zone now.

181
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,820
I forgot I had to silence her.

182
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,940
Alright.

183
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
Alright, everybody.

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
I need a sacrifice.

185
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,180
Alright, default women.

186
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,860
You know what that means.

187
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,320
You guys had swords this entire time?

188
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,840
You guys had swords this entire time?

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
You guys had swords this entire time?

190
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,280
No.

191
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,470
How did you win?

192
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,350
