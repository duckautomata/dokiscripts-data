Alright, here we go.

42
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,620
Alright.

43
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,020
I'm playing the support, of course.

44
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,220
I forgot what gun's good, though, in this game.

45
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,880
We're really good gun.

46
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,480
Oh, you're an open mic, by the way.

47
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,540
Am I open mic?

48
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,740
Yeah, you are.

49
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,140
I hear your echo.

50
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,100
I'm pretty sure.

51
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:07:46,090 --> 00:08:11,310
there is that fixed yeah yeah it's fixed now w but then the poor people okay so you gotta talk to people in the game for me because wait what why because i just turned off my mic they can just listen to my stream you tell them on my stream and then they'll just listen they're also at the venue they just listen to my stream wait that means like everybody on the venue can hear our comms.

53
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,170
Yeah.

54
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,370
So, what's the point of talking to our team when they can just listen to the stream?

55
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,470
To be fair, the other streamer can probably hear you talk too, so.

56
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,590
Oh, that is so true.

57
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,470
No, no, because he's a wait, okay, does he, does he like...

58
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,190
He's right next to me.

59
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,130
Oh, okay.

60
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,290
But, like, is he, like, fully fluent in...

61
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,170
Because he's, like, a streamer from Germany, right?

62
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,510
He can understand English, yes.

63
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:35,790
Oh, okay.

64
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,350
Okay.

65
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,250
I was asking, is he fully fluent in English?

66
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,730
He doesn't know what I'm saying.

67
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:42,850
Okay, I need to turn.

68
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,530
Where are we going, dude?

69
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,470
Wait, am I?

70
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:44,890
Am I?

71
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,510
No, player 3 is the jump master.

72
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,330
Just take us anywhere.

73
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,150
But not for us to die.

74
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,790
Okay, player 3 that we're going to believe in the player 3.

75
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,230
Yeah, you don't believe in your team.

76
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,350
I just want to go out there.

77
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,530
You don't believe in your team.

78
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,970
I believe in player 3.

79
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,850
So I need adjusted graphic settings.

80
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,750
Listen, I would have also went Slade and...

81
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,230
No, he's changed his mind.

82
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,990
I believe in him.

83
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,410
No, we're back to Slade.

84
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,130
But I believe, and we all have like, you know, one try to die, basically.

85
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,310
Oh, yeah, actually, before we die, we could...

86
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,130
Yeah, exactly.

87
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,170
We can go again.

88
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:19,690
No, we don't want to die.

89
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,010
Let me... I'm going to turn my graphics to low.

90
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,790

Alright, here we go.

94
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,830

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,590
Whoa.

Opening the door.

I'm fine with opening doors.

109
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,520
Opening doors is one second.

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,000
Like, lock and...

156
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
I'm at 100% CPU!

157
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,440
I'm trying to fix my shit!

158
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,900
Okay, give me...

159
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm actually getting gear by random, like, we're actually getting gear right now.

160
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,080
It's okay.

161
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:14,780
It's fine.

162
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,480
That's good.

163
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,660
Full-time streamers, professional players, and...

164
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,160
You didn't even look, you didn't even change your settings.

165
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,000
You didn't even change your settings.

166
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,020
I did change my settings, but Cario, like, literally on purpose.

167
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,260
Yeah, and you didn't re-change, you didn't look at it.

168
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,660
You had, like, 10 minutes to fix that.

169
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,460
Get in the car.

170
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,280

171
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:36,680

Okay, give me a second.

173
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,160
It takes like four seconds for me to get in a car.

174
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,700
Give me a sec.

175
00:14:41,840 --> 00:16:02,100

237
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,460
I had to chug coffee before the stream.

238
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,240

Good for him.

247
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
Well, maybe you should be a better driver.

248
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,800
I don't think this is going to pull up, so I think we should stay under silent.

249
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,360
Alright, for those who want to know where we are, we're right here.

250

Come to us if you want to fight.

255
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,880
Oh, look, they're fighting down there.

256
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,440
Oh, shit.

257
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:45,940
Yeah, let's go.

258
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,080
Wait, when they're moving, run them over.

259
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,020
Run them over.

260
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,660
Oh, you're fucking...

261
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,260
You take the car and you run them over.

262
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,840
No, no, I'm not running them over at 200 ping.

263
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,680
Oh, I can't kill them.

264
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,340
I'm 110 on one.

265
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,360
Yeah, 125.

266
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,100
You're kill stealing now.

267
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,420
I hit 125.

268
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,360
There's no way.

269
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,140
Stop kill stealing.

270
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,040
It was actually 50 damage.

271
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,480
I was like, don't be bad, it's just that easy.

272
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,140
I'm being bad.

273
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,920
Then maybe I won't kill still.

274
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,240
One team is dead, but I think there's one more team.

275
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,080
There's a guy right here at the bottom.

276
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,900
I feel like we're going to get, like, ran at.

277
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,400
No, we're going to, there's someone above us.

278
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,240
There's someone above us that ulted us.

279
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,580
Oh, we're getting ulted.

280
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,220
Yep.

281
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,740
We should take a car.

282
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,600
Get in the car and run?

283
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,360
Yeah.

284
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,080
Is there another car that we could steal?

285
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,020
Our other car is almost dead though.

287
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,640
You say there's a guy here, you lied.

288
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,680
Like there's no one here.

289
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,400
Okay, but who ulted behind us?

290
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,780
Oh no, there is.

291
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,260
I literally...

292
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,820
No, I saw a guy like ran there.

293
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,160
I literally saw him.

294
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,660
I saw him like skate down.

295
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,980
Watch my stream.

296
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,940
Rewatch my stream.

297
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,320
I don't have rewind, huh?

298
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,120
Yeah, I got you.

299
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,900
There we go.

300
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,400
Where's his team?

301
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,600
Where's his car?

302
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,620
We need a car.

303
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,440
There's a car right there.

304
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,140
Wait.

305
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
His team is over there on red.

306
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:20,800
Look, look.

307
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,860
On there?

308
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,700
Oh, I see him.

309
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,780
He's running.

310
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,880
10 still person.

311
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:28,820
175?

312
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,620
He's dead.

313
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,560
Okay, nice.

314
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
Alright, let's get the other car before we get shot at.

315
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,100
Let's get this one.

316
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,320
Yeah, yeah.

317
00:25:38,240 --> 00:26:08,880

318
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,220
guys, we're right here.

319
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,760
We're getting a jet.

320
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,140
We're getting a jet collector because...

321
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,840
You don't want to shoot us.

322
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,660
You're going to die and I'm going to need it.

323
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,260
I'm going to need it.

324
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,460
Wait, someone dropped something.

325
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:20,980
Three mores left.

326
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,140
Yeah, top four.

327
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,260
Let's go.

328
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,740
Look at this.

329
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,080
Find a photo of us.

330
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,920
Also, like, I'm Doki Bird 4.

331
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,140
That means someone stole Doki Bird 1 and 3 before I could make this account.

332
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:33,620
That's two.

333
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,140
No, I was two.

334
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,380
I was two.

335
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,220
But, like, someone made...

336
00:26:38,240 --> 00:27:09,120
through one and four what are my i can't even tell what my frames are oh it has to be good frames because it doesn't feel like i'm dropping this card does not go up though but it's tough wait there's another special package let's get that yeah maybe i get gold here did you yeah that is oh there's a portable teleporter i want that okay get that out of here I want that.

337
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,480
What do I just take here right now?

338
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,740
I'm just gonna park the car here and I'm gonna just look over the hill.

339
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,020
Wait, I hear a car.

340
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,480
Wait, I think someone's gonna try and run us over.

341
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,380
Yeah, behind us, behind us, behind us.

342
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,560
I don't think they're trying to run us over, but they're trying to run to us.

343
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,260
Oh, that was awkward.

344
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,700
Oh, that's awkward.

345
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,960
Out of the car, sir.

346
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,160
Why did he stay in the car?

347
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,180
I think they have teammates though.

348
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,620
No, they definitely do.

349
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,620
They have to.

350
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,160
Wait, I made a shot from this side.

351
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,600
Okay, chill.

352
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,060
That's like the legendary sniper.

353
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:46,980
Oh.

354
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm pretty sure one of them used the legendary sniper over there.

355
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,020
Wait, why don't we just run up to him?

356
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,720
What is he going to do?

357
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,340
Shoot at us?

358
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,680
Yeah, it's just one guy.

359
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,740
I don't think he realized we're going to run up to him.

360
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,520
I cracked him.

361
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,300
I cracked him.

362
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,000
Kill him.

363
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,160
He's dead.

364
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,260
Does this hurt me?

365
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,160
Is that full kill?

366
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,620
Is that full kill?

367
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,620
Yeah, it's a full kill.

368
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,920
Well, actually, I don't know.

369
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,460
No, no, no, it's not full kill.

370
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,240
It's not full kill.

371
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,480
Here.

372
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,500
Now that's full kill.

373
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,940
Now we're full kill.

374
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,140
We should probably like look for more cars.

375
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,280
This is the last team.

376
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,800
Hey, last person.

377
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,820

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,240
You're so confident this person's watching us.

381
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,080
Yes, look up from the monitor.

382
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,280

387
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,120
Knocked another one from the building.

388
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:41,780
Okay.

If you're watching the stream, two got down.

391
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,460
We're not coming with you, by the way.

392
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,540
I knocked another one.

393
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,200

397
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,800

Okay.

402
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,460
Don't worry.

403
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,080
I could use some help.

404
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,120
Okay.

405
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,620
Don't worry.

406
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,360
I altered.

407
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,280
Okay.

408
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,180
I altered outside.

409
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,520
Thank you so much for your ult.

410
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,000
They're throwing nades and shit.

411
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,780
Where are they?

412
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,820
Now if you had nades you could throw some nades too, though I don't have nades.

413
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,740
I don't have nades.

414
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,120
I ulted outside, but then I think that was a bad idea I just made it myself stay.

415
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,980
Oh shit.

416
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,440

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,580
Oh, nice.

431
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,580
Yeah, see?

432
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,580
I definitely know what I was doing.

433
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,060
You're so stressful.

434
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,620
Oh, my God.

435
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,420
We did it.

436
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,380
You're stressing me out, Kirk.

437
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,340
Hey, I'm not even bottom frag.

438
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,380
Look at me.

439
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm not even bottom frag That's not true.

440
00:31:43,600 --> 00:32:04,220
I had more kills than the last the other guy you were in your settings page half the game The fact that I was in settings were half my game and I'm not bottom frag says a lot The fact that I did more damage than two of my teammates well in my settings What the fuck do you mean?

441
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,540
I am!

442
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,140
Why the fuck are you doing my damage when I'm in my settings?

443
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,820
Yes, I am!

444
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,160
Just for the people that are in the venue here because I could...

445
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,720
Because I'm here physically, I think you guys carried.

446
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,700
Doki's not here, so she can just get whatever she wants.

447
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,740
Hey, hey, look, I think they did a great job.

448
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:33,720
They did a great job, but all I'm saying is that I clearly put up my weight because I did... I was second fragger for some reason.

449
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,780
Wait, is there going to be a new lobby?

450
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,620
Yeah, a new lobby, you're going to get the code.

451
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,540
Don't leak it.

452
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,920
Oh, wait, they already made it.

453
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,620
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,500
Okay, okay, okay.

455
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,320
And hide your screen.

456
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,440
Okay, can you tell me what the...

457
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,540
Okay, I got it.

458
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,460
Do you have the code?

459
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,260
Okay, so the first number is zero.

460
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,770
Wait, it says the password's not right.

461
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:07,810
Is that not?

462
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,230
Oh, wait.

463
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,250
Okay, the first number is zero.

464
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,690
Does Doki have the code?

465
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:14,630
Yeah, I do.

466
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,010
I do.

467
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,050
Do I need to give Doki the code?

468
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,790
No, no, I got it.

469
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,170
I'm in.

470
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,710
I'm in.

471
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,430
Oh, okay, okay.

472
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:19,770
She's in.

473
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,370
She just typed the wrong code.

474
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,330
Yeah, I just, yeah.

475
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,370
Yeah, I am.

476
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,110
I'm so professional.

477
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,450
Professional streamer.

478
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,270
That's right.

479
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,350
That's me.

480
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,050
Hey, people are having a good time.

481
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,510
What if we don't get carried now?

482
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,810
What if we don't get carried now?

483
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,090
Okay, let's... Okay, who's the...

Let's see who loses.

494
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,750
I had a great time even before we won the game.

495
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,190
Because we are- Can you at least stop flaming our randoms?

496
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,150
Because you're not in the venue with them, I am.

497
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,650
I didn't even flame them.

498
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,190
I just said do better.

499
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,430
I said do better.

500
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,250
That's not flaming.

501
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,850
I'm like encouraged them to get better at the game.

502
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,190
So how about, let's go there.

503
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,310
Okay.

504
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,890
The player T is flying here.

505
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,570
Okay, I definitely need a like...

506
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,250
Okay, we're going straight down.

507
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,270
Lower my...

508
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,110
I didn't even want to go.

509
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,330
I didn't even want to go agriculture.

510
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,250
I wanted to go here.

511
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,230
Okay, I'm lowering my sense.

512
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,030
I'm still trying to figure out what my sense is for this game.

513
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,310
Because I forgot what...

514
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,550
No, I'm literally...

515
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,530
I'm not in settings anymore.

516
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,890
I was like, oh my god, let me lower my sense just a little bit.

517
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,850
You know, people at the venue are watching you here in half the game, the last game, they're watching you being in your settings.

518
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,070
Okay, yeah, and we won.

519
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:07,670
And we won.

520
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,190
And I did more damage than our other teammates.

521
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,690
So, like, how about that?

522
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,930
I did not warm up, too.

523
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,790
Like, I still did, like, top second fragger.

524
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,250
Okay.

525
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,390
Let's go.

526
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:26,950
Are we contested?

527
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,030
I don't know.

528
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:28,830
Hold on.

529
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,050

531
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,750
See, now I know I'm not the fuck-around person here.

00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,010
Wait, can I say...

533
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,570

536
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,470
I'm not going to get fine, am I?

537
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,430
I don't know.

538
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,750

540
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,330
Ask the devs right now.

541
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,110
Devs are off the stage.

542
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,110
I'm not going to go...

543
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,930
No, just ask the devs.

544
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,330
Am I...

545
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,490
Wait, they can listen to the stream.

546
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,690
Devs, am I okay?

547
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,010

Devs, can she swear she can't stop herself.

549
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,230
I can't stop myself.

550
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,590
I've done it before!

551
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,330
I just need a no!

552
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,190
Okay, so...

553
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,790
Okay, we're good.

554
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,470
I'm okay.

555
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,270
Everything will be fine.

556
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,150
Wait, what are we doing anyway?

557
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,590
We're looting!

558
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:54,850
Oh.

559
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,950
I need...

560
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,970
I need a canteus.

561
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,670
I just haven't found a canteus yet.

562
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,630
Yeah, I found a canteus.

563
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,390
Yay!

564
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,430
I asked and I received.

565
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,550
I'm going to try out a shotgun with me.

566
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,630
Okay, I'm shooting my gun, but there's nobody.

567
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,790
I just want to test my sense.

568
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,410
Okay, I'm just testing my sense.

569
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,190
I lowered it a little.

570
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,070
It was so fast earlier, so I lowered it.

571
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,730
I think the shotgun's really good.

572
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,510
I mean, it's getting close range.

573
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,910
It's like, uh, just a two pump.

574
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,690
Oh, I hear people shooting, yeah.

575
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,970
Oh, there must be, like, two people here.

576
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,250
Let's get rid of them.

577
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,730
I believe.

578
00:38:38,450 --> 00:39:11,370
here oh you already killed us no yeah we're getting carried again yay i have 200 ping so i deserve to get carried be fair it doesn't feel like i have 200 ping though the register the shot register is pretty good yeah i'll put into the bigger stuff okay where are they anyway there's nobody here we killed one oh there I'd say that and then I like with three shots.

579
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,710
That's...

580
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,950
They had to be like...

581
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,910
There's no way that was totally on his body.

582
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,890
I was blaming Ping for that.

583
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,850
Just killed him.

584
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,270
I saw them.

585
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,790
Why are they running in the open?

586
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,570
Poor guy.

587
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,110
Poor guy.

588
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,870
I mean, they get around too anyway.

589
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,770
Yeah, they get a res.

590
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,850
Don't worry, sir.

591
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,030
You can come back.

592
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,190
Don't worry, if you died from us, don't worry, you'll come back.

593
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,310
Check this out.

594
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,230
I want to get back to the first three zones or something.

595
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,190
Three zones.

596
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,010
And then it's all bullying randoms.

597
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,770
They're not randoms.

598
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,790
They're not randoms.

599
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,750
They're real people.

600
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,850
Yeah, we want to win.

601
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:58,710
Hello.

602
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,690
We were paid to win and not paid to lose.

603
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,510
Yeah, redeem ourselves from the tournament.

604
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,110
I'll take it.

605
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:06,790
I'll take it.

606
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,890
I think that's how it works, but...

607
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,890
This is a paid-a-win lobby.

608
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,090
You guys are good stuff here.

609
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:20,450
You guys just gave me the knob paid-a-win?

610
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,190
No, it's not.

611
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,730
Guys, I'm just saying that we're sponsored a win.

612
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,910
Oh, a lot of purple armor.

613
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,510
Look at this.

614
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,930
Oh, shit.

615
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,010
It's not paid-a-win, guys.

616
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,170
But since we're gamers, we're skilled to win.

617
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,550
What else?

618
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,790

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,990
Just run them over.

651
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,330
Just get a car and run them over.

652
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,550
Yeah, do that.

653
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,410
Oh, like, player two and three, run them over.

654
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,430
It'll be so funny.

655
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,490
Alright, I'll just drive with our guy.

656
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,250
Oh, we're running?

657
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:42,590
No, run them over.

658
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:43,710
Drive them over.

659
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:44,610
Drive them over.

660
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,330
Don't be...

661
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,230
Don't be weak.

662
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,050
Drive them over.

663
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:48,830
Don't be what?

664
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:49,730
Don't be... Don't be...

665
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,630
Don't be weak.

666
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,230
Don't be weak.

667
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:51,850
Don't be weak.

668
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,190
Go run them over.

669
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:53,570
Drive.

670
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:53,950
Drive.

671
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:54,450
Just drive.

672
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,890
Oh, like, yeah, see, it's that easy.

673
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,910
Oh, wait, I should have executed.

674
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:02,610
I get the perk.

675
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,150
Oh, wait, there's a guy.

676
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,710
Here, he's dead.

677
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,230
Tony more.

678
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,190
No, no, no, no, don't run him over.

679
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,110
Why not?

680
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:11,830
See what you did, Duffy?

681
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:12,770
I didn't run him!

682
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,890
If I execute him, you get wall-locked on all of them.

683
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,090
What did you say?

684
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,510
I didn't do anything.

685
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,430
What did I do?

686
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:22,870
That's why he, like, full killed, I'm pretty sure.

687
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,470
She was both killed.

688
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,590
I know.

689
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,090
All right.

690
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,890
We gotta go observatives, you know.

691
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:36,950
Where do we go now?

692
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,990
Are we letting player two drive?

693
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,090
Well, I mean, I can't kick him off the car, so yeah.

694
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,850
Player two, can you leave your car for a bit in Helen?

695
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,570
It's fine.

696
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,730
Player two can drive.

697
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:51,430
It's fine.

698
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,230
Let's see.

699
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,390
I believe in you, player two.

700
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,070
RPR did not believe in you.

701
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,330
I always believed in you.

702
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,530
But RPR messaged me on...

703
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,390
Messaged me on Discord and was like, we shouldn't let Player 2 drive.

704
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,330
And I was like, that's messed up.

705
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:06,890
Okay.

706
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,610
I trust you, Player 2.

707
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,590
We're getting shot from behind.

708
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,090
Run them over.

709
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,450
Run them over.

710
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:15,970
You got this Player 2.

711
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,010
Just run them over.

712
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,030
Okay, it's okay.

713
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:18,570
Don't run them over.

714
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,330
Run them over.

715
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,070
Run them.

716
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,710
He's still alive.

717
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,010
Oh, wait.

718
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:23,470
He's dead.

719
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,830
I'm gonna

720
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:55,990

It's not my fault.

723
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,650
You know, I'm a player three now, dude.

724
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,510
Yeah, but player two is going to be.

725
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,850
And you guys can go around all the people over there.

726
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,910
I believe in you, player two.

727
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,670
You got this.

728
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,670
I like your style.

729
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:21,470
Where were we?

730
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,130
I heard gun.

731
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,430
Why were you shooting?

732
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,450
Yeah, no, someone was shooting.

733
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,910
It was crazy.

734
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:26,630
Yeah.

735
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,510
Oh, don't, oh, we don't have gas.

736
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,390
We don't have gas.

737
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,490
We got a swap.

738
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,330
Oh, that's so fortunate.

739
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:33,090
Yeah.

740
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:34,590
It's time to swap guns.

741
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,590
All right, player two, player.

742
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:36,150
Oh, okay.

743
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:36,970
Player two left.

744
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,350
I don't think they know.

745
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:38,870
Oh, let's go to airdrop.

746
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,990
I don't think they know that their cars ran out of gas.

747
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,830
Here you go, player two.

748
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,970
We should probably hunt airdrop to get a legend.

749
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,910
That's true.

750
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:53,490
That's true.

751
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,110
I'm driving now and 200 ping.

752
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,170
Do you think we'll be okay?

753
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,710
I think you wouldn't be okay if you were okay.

754
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,030
Oh yeah, that's true.

755
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,890
I remember what happened.

756
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,090
When I...

757
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:08,990
I already did this.

758
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,530
There you did?

759
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:12,570
No.

760
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,030
See, the harmonizer capture started.

761
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:15,750
Stupid.

762
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,390
Oh, you can read what's the same.

763
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,070
Okay.

764
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,970
I'm going to go up the stairs, man.

765
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:23,170
Actually...

766
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,450
You gotta stand in circles so we can...

767
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,330
get it done for us.

768
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,130
Well, why can't our randoms do it?

769
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,070
Sorry, not randoms.

770
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,030
Our lovely players are with us.

771
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:34,350
Okay, players, players two and three, stand here.

772
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,530
I want to loot.

773
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,090
I want to loot now.

774
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,050
They say, oh, wait, it's fully looted up top.

775
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,710
I don't think there's much loot above us.

776
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,270
Yeah, there is.

777
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:48,910
Yeah, it's looted.

778
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,450
No, but they, sometimes it has good loot at the top.

779
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:53,210
I remember.

780
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:55,550
I'm here now.

781
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,970
Looks like someone got you from the You'll need it.

782
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,670
I'm here now.

783
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:01,750
Is it a car?

784
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,330
Is it?

785
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:03,890
I hear a car.

786
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:04,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,710
I'm going ahead up because I don't want them to run at me.

788
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,450
Oh my god, I know.

789
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,070
Come on, I think.

790
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:10,470
Yeah, I did.

791
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,170
Are you guys doing it?

792
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,830
I don't see anybody.

793
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:16,130
No.

794
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,390
I'm like a little lost right now on the second floor.

795
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,390
Don't worry, I'm here to help.

796
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:23,190
I did it.

797
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:24,730
I did it, guys.

798
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,270
Well, guys.

799
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,150
I was there.

800
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,690
I got lost.

801
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,570
I actually...

802
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,930
Oh, nice.

803
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,970
I actually sort of got lost in the room area.

804
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:43,930
Oh, they are corrosive.

805
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:44,690
Gladiator.

806
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,050
Oh, corrosive Gladiator.

807
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,790
Wait, that's good.

808
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,110
I don't even get to use my shotgun.

809
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,130
I kill everyone in that range.

810
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,410
Okay.

811
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,710
Now we go back here.

812
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,310
We gotta stand back here again.

813
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,650
Alright guys, we gotta do this thing again.

814
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,410
How do you emote?

815
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,330
Um, I don't remember.

816
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,650
How do we emote?

817
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,850
The other guy was dancing in front of me.

818
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,110
Oh wait, is that another player?

819
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,490
Well, let's...

820
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:11,170
Let's go.

821
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,010
From there.

822
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

823
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,170
Oh my god, in a car!

824
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:14,690
We're up!

825
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,610
Holy shit!

826
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:16,410
I!

827
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:17,090
Wait!

828
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,270
There's two people on the street!

829
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,850
Oh my god, that guy run over?

830
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,390
We killed two.

831
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,550
What happened?

832
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,230
Come to me, come to me, come to me, go to me!

833
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,570
I don't know what happened to me.

834
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,450
I don't know what happened to you.

835
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,170
I literally exploded.

836
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,790
You got run over or no, the car blew up and you took a lot of damage.

837
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:32,570
Oh, okay.

838
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,510
That makes more sense.

839
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,230
Um, I'm with you.

840
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,890
This is so risky.

841
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,590
He's helping from up top.

842
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,850
Our team got full kill, but we can retrieve.

843
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,150
Okay.

844
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,990
You full heal yourself and then get an idea.

845
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:43,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

846
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:44,610
I'm here.

847
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,250
I think second floor is probably too strong.

848
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,470
I am fully healing myself.

849
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,010
I got him on scan, I think.

850
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,150
Oh my God.

851
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:53,890
I got exploded.

852
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:55,230
Got one?

853
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:55,710
Okay.

854
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:56,630
I'm heading to the roof.

855
00:50:56,890 --> 00:52:13,370
right now where are they in the smoke in the smoke one's not in the smoke i'm like randomly shooting it i'm i'm burning him this month i just threw like a million oh okay i got hit by something i got sniped by something i got sniped by something i don't know where i'm healing i'm healing i don't know where i got sniped oh okay deep left deep left oh it's it's yeah yeah i killed the sniper I have thirsty one just in case we have to go to the zone I'm gonna go pick her up pick that I made up I killed all I killed all I'm extracting you're all dead all dead you can just res or there I don't think this zone hurts I mean share how do I res again oh T just put it down yeah yeah I put it down I'm just gonna head to the zone though okay so it basically exploded in mean that's why basically what happens here the car here with a car and then i blew up the car oh so you blew up the car and i died oh okay that makes sense because i literally was like wait no you almost killed yourself too because

856
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:58,250
you almost died from that you actually almost that's actually that's actually like the most stupid thing you've ever done that's no that's the most stupid thing you've ever done okay and i like i like how you left our teammates and here taxing them i just want to make sure that i'm just scouting out for us i'm literally scouting that's what he's gonna die player two four four is healed four is healed you could also you know heal them your ability yeah i can right now because you're too far okay now i can see there you go i don't say never do anything get me good zone okay that's actually pretty far i had to secure the zone for us guys i was a team player

857
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:32,540
i don't think it was almost out of fuels my car has lots there's another car behind you guys that you can swap your car has a lot of fuel but you're the one driving it so um you can drive this car whenever you want i got a new one i got a new one wait wait there's a fight in front of us gosh i don't know if i should be here this way this way i hear shots this way oh my gosh i'm not okay We should go get high ground before we do anything.

858
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,640
Wait, there's people shooting in front of me.

859
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,680
They're below the ridge.

860
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,260
Oh, wait, actually, I'm leaving.

861
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:37,760
I'm leaving.

862
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,240
I'm leaving.

863
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,080
Let them die in zone.

864
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:39,980
Let them die in zone.

865
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,380
I'm leaving.

866
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,640
I'm just going to kill a little bit.

867
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,680
All right, I'm just going to...

868
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,000
I'm driving the zone.

869
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,720
Don't worry, I'll secure the zone, guys.

870
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,880
But there's people who are shooting in front of me.

871
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,160
I have $730, I think.

872
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,160
Money.

873
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,460
I have $375.

874
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:59,240
securing zone zone secure you're not even in zone what are you securing you're not even in the zone zone secure I'm securing outside the zone I'm scouting I'm scouting there you go I'm pretty sure he just run someone over player three oh nice good for him uh we're dead center okay i don't like being in the center i see people shooting from really far away i'm gonna get out of car now oh they're on the enhancing station that's that's what it's called for sure i don't see them right now they're on the roof on the roof yeah okay i'll just scan for you soon okay it's just one guy wait it's one guy yeah he's still dead Okay,

875
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,720
he's definitely dead But he has teammates.

876
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,320
Where is his teammates?

877
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,460
They had teammates Now I wish I had a sniper He said I'll shot him.

878
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,540
Are we gonna live in the hand station now?

879
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,020
Yeah, this is our time Okay, one more up there three.

880
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:24,360
I got you There's a guy He's in the middle of the road red guy.

881
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:29,960
That guy is crazy That guy is Z for doing that.

882
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,080
Oh, we won.

883
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,680
Oh, that's the last guy.

884
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,940
Wait, what happened to everybody?

885
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,080
Okay, this time I didn't do a lot of damage.

886
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,480
I was actually fucking around.

887
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,500
You actually got out damage by everyone.

888
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,460
I got, yeah, I was messing around.

889
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,160
What did you do this whole game?

890
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,360
I healed.

891
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,620
Settings again?

892
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,080
Oh, it says the guy that like exploded a car in our faces.

893
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,080
And killed 14 people.

894
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:58,600
Like, hello?

895
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,800
And including your teammates, you killed your teammates.

896
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,740
I sacrificed you.

897
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,080
You know what, player three, sure, I'll be your friend, player three.

898
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,620
Another player three, sure.

899
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,080
Friend, sure, let's do it.

900
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,580
I'll friend all these players.

901
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,060
Carrying doki was so hard.

902
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,020
Can we make her play harder and then can I just go a little bit?

903
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:59,080
I was I felt we were carried by our random I played this gang character because I just think she's very useful just knowing enemy's position in Balor Rale is always going to be the most useful thing and it just works well with any combination so you're doing like PR PR's interview right now very useful also for the rocks I guess what's that again very good for securing the rocks wise Overall,

904
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,740
I think...

905
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,740
You think what?

906
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,860
You think you can think?

907
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,120
Well, he muted himself.

908
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,540
He doesn't want me to hear anymore.

909
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,000
That's messed up.

910
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,760
Why mute yourself?

911
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,900
Let the people know.

912
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,540
Oh, we're just waiting for...

913
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,300
We're just waiting for RPR right now.

914
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,320
I was getting asked how...

915
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,860
So basically what asked me is, how do you keep carrying Godoki so hard?

916
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,460
It's insane.

917
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,060
Sure, sure, buddy.

918
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,320
Playing two declined my friend request?

919
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,300
Who are you?

920
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,240
No, someone, I sent friend request to a randoms and they denied my friend request.

921
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,080
The person that was playing with us.

922
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,500
Maybe they're not allowed to accept friends because it's like not their accounts.

923
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,480
It's messed up.

924
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,180
You don't want to be friends with me?

925
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,020
I don't want to be friends with you either.

926
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,480
They basically, like the interview asked me, Oh my god, Doc, he's so, so bad.

927
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,760
Like, how do you keep, like, just, like, winning with her in the same team?

928
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:09,180
It's like, listen, sometimes you've got to lock in and just carry the flanker, you know, and that's what I do.

929
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,020
I carry the flanker.

930
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,420
Okay, fun.

931
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,060
Fun.

932
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,400
I'll stop playing support.

933
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,820
Now you don't have any heals.

934
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,840
No, no, no, that character is really good.

935
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,440
No, I'm not going to play her anymore.

936
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,280
No, because I'm so bad.

937
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,640
I'm not playing her anymore.

938
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,200
Maybe she just wasn't my character.

939
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,220
But mature.

940
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,900
I'll play the healer, girl.

941
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,120
What if I play the healer girl and I still care?

942
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:30,420
No.

943
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,160
No, no, no.

944
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,300
Nobody plays her.

945
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,300
No one is allowed to play.

946
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,580
No one is allowed.

947
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,720
Yes, exactly.

948
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,400
No one is allowed to play her now.

949
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,760
She is probably the best character in the game, but I don't know.

950
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,400
No, no.

951
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,260
I'll play her so nobody can get healed.

952
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,440
Except for our randoms.

953
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,380
I'll heal our randoms.

954
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,300
Just not RPR.

955
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,800
So you're going to play her and then you're not...

956
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:03,820
Yeah, I'm gonna play her and heal my teammates except for RPR exception.

957
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,020
Alright, cool, cool.

958
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,860
Yeah, yeah, use your- I don't get heals anymore.

959
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,200
Yes, you don't- you've lost your healing privileges.

960
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,740
You healed me once in two games.

961
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,680
Never flayed the support or they'll never heal you.

962
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,260
You healed me once in two games.

963
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,300
I think I'll lose you.

964
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,960
I raised you twice.

965
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,440
I raised you.

966
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,680
Yeah, because one of them you killed me with.

967
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,480
A car.

968
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,220
You literally killed me with a car.

969
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,320
Okay, but you were sacrificed for the greater good.

970
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,640
What greater good?

971
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,820
I got six kills from that.

972
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:38,860
What do you mean?

973
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,900
There's four people.

974
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,480
My KD.

975
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,500
There's four people in one team.

976
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,420
Where does the five and six come from?

977
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,020
No, I killed the first four, and then there's two from the other team that came.

978
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,620
I don't know about that.

979
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,120
I mean, I don't know.

980
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,680
I feel like our teammates who are very good teammates.

981
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:28,300
also contributed to those kills not everything's just about you rpr sometimes we have teammates that help out along the ride check my water check my water i don't need a bot review to know what actually happened you did 231 damage last game let's stop yapping and start locking in yeah because i was mostly running around and healing people like a good teammate like a good support i want my chat some of my chats it says the womb that trashed off her first teammates no i didn't shocked him.

982
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,020
I gave them constructive criticism.

983
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,300
It was constructive criticism.

984
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,280
A player 3 is our jump master.

985
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,280
It's always player 3.

986
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:42,720
Have you noticed?

987
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,660
Yeah, I do.

988
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,860
I trust my player 3s.

989
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,600
Player 3s have been the good players.

990
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,040
They've been treating us well.

991
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,560
We have all agreed to jump here.

992
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,100
Let's go.

993
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:52,340
Okay.

994
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,200

I killed the other one.

1050
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,140
There's only one more guy left.

1051
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,760
No, but that's more to the four people then, right?

1052
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,720
Well, the other one, the other one, he didn't full die.

1053
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,400

Yeah, do you know how to shoot out of a car?

1163
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,430
Yeah, I just shoot at it.

1164
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:52,990
I just go, pop, pop.

1165
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:58,570
That's how you do it.

1166
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:01,530
I just go, pop, pop, and then we'll fly.

1167
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:04,370
Guys, there's no mainstream on GameStop chat.

1168
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,210

We are the mainstream.

1171
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:11,070
Wait, there's no shooting.

1172
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:12,990
Technically, you're on the big screen, so...

1173
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,930
Yeah, I am the main stream.

01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:36,250
We're not real.

1184
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:40,090

1185
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:42,790

There's still behind us?

1190
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:51,270
Our team, our players are lost.

1191
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:54,910
We are still...

1192
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:55,730
Maybe they know where they're going.

1193
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:58,610
Maybe they're just trying to find another car.

1194
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:00,010
All right, mission is to...

1195

01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,470

1201
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,610
I see that.

1202
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,390
Okay.

1203
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,510
Alright, let's go.

1204
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:17,350
This car's crazy with it.

1205
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,310
Oh, run them over!

1206
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:19,010
Run them over!

1207
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:20,810
With this thing?

1208
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:21,670
Yeah!

1209
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:22,370
Run them over!

1210
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:23,230
They're right there!

1211
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,850
Oh my god, they're so red- Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1212
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,350
Maybe don't.

1213
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:26,870
Maybe don't.

1214
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:28,410
Maybe don't- Maybe don't!

1215
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,050
I am!

1216
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,890
This thing is not very controllable.

1217
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,210
I think I'm gonna get run over soon.

1218
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:36,790
Heal me?

1219
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:38,690
I can't!

1220
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:39,310
You're so far!

1221
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:40,190
There's a car behind you!

1222
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:41,090
There's a car behind us!

1223
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,410
There's a new team!

1224
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:49,550
Okay, I'm gonna use my res thing and then you TP to my res if you need to.

1225
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:52,030
Okay, one team should be dead, but there's more people on me.

1226
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,130
I- Yeah, I'm gonna go down.

1227
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:57,310
I have the res thing, you can use that.

1228
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:00,850
I'm not gonna- Yeah, you get TP to me.

1229
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,710
Hold on, I'm location reveal, I might die.

1230
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,210
14 seconds, 14 seconds.

1231
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,350
Oh my gosh, 14 seconds.

1232
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:08,330
Okay.

1233
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,090
I'm here, I'm here.

1234
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:14,870
I'm gonna- I'm gonna head high ground a little.

1235
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,650
We lost our other car, though.

1236
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,310
Not so many people.

1237
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,350
I don't know who's who anymore.

1238
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:21,490
Yeah, we need to get our other car because there's a lot of people coming over.

1239
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:22,530
A new team from there?

1240
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:26,990
I don't feel very safe here in the open.

1241
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:28,690
I'm taking that car in front of us.

1242
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,690
Unless that was the car we ditched.

1243
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:34,570
I got the car.

1244
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,230
No, that's nice.

1245
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,390
Oh, up the hill, up, up, up, up, up, up.

1246
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1247
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,350
You hear me?

1248
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:40,950
I'm driving a car, but okay.

1249
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:44,150
Which way?

1250
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:45,710
Okay, this way?

1251
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:46,430
Okay, go get in the car.

1252
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:46,930
Get in the car.

1253
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,310
Be honest.

1254
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:49,550
Be honest.

1255
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:50,070
Not there.

1256
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:50,390
Not there.

1257
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:51,310
That's the other team.

1258
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:52,550
That is behind us.

1259
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:52,870
Okay.

1260
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,250
Like in front, like a red pink.

1261
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:56,190
Okay, okay.

1262
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:56,890
Yeah.

1263
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,490
Now I know.

1264
01:13:59,210 --> 01:13:59,590
Oh, wait.

1265
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:00,210
Where are they?

1266
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:00,670
Oh, wait.

1267
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:01,030
I want this one.

1268
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:02,950
Oh, got him.

1269
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:03,490
One team dead.

1270
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:04,630
Oh, our guys.

1271
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:05,170
Our guy's on.

1272
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:05,630
Yeah, yeah.

1273
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,470
We can't res.

1274
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:06,850
We can't res.

1275
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:07,570
He's getting shot at.

1276
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:09,690
Yeah, that's something.

1277
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:11,810
I literally can't res out.

1278
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,050
I killed them.

1279
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:13,490
Okay, they're dead.

1280
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:13,670
They're dead.

1281
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:14,030
They're dead.

1282
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:14,170
Okay, okay.

1283
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:14,530
Ours.

1284
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,230
That's full kill, I think.

1285
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:18,990
Okay, that... I am.

1286
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,010

01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:23,830
What a mess.

1288
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,170
We live though.

1289
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:26,670
We're alive.

1290
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:31,010
So we got sandwiched by one guy, so it was a whole different team.

Where do we go?

1304
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,420
This car, when you use the shift ability, like the super speed, you can't turn.

01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,160

01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,460
He wants to kill you.

1352
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,260
I can't hit him, so you might die.

1353
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,220
I actually can't hit him.

1354
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:14,640
You might die.

1355
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,480
Give me a sec.

1356
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,000
I can do that.

1357
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:17,640
You actually might die.

1358
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,780
I know I'm fine.

1359
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,560
My car is so fine.

1360
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,720
Did you run him over?

1361
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,420
No, not.

1362
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,400
Oh my god, it's two people.

1363
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,680
No, there's two people I wanted.

1364
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,740
Yeah, multiple people.

1365
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,680
There's two people.

1366
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,660
I'm fucking driving down.

1367
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,020
I'm just...

1368
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:31,980
That's okay.

1369
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,900
I could go back up.

1370
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,660
I can go back up.

1371
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,120
It's okay.

1372
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,620
If you press shift on this little like geyser thing, you can actually...

1373
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:42,440
With my car?

1374
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:42,900
What?

1375
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,280
Yeah, yeah.

1376
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:45,640
Okay.

1377
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,260
It's like a glider.

1378
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,280
Okay, I'm trolling.

1379
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:54,860
Okay, I'm not trolling.

1380
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,020
I can't wait.

1381
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,400
Are you alive?

1382
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,300
I killed him.

1383
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,860
I gave up.

1384
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,580
I gave up.

1385
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,340
I can't run them over.

1386
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:06,340
It was too hard.

1387
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,160
It was too hard.

1388
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,060
But there's one more or something.

1389
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,000
Maybe he has Sopras.

1390
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:14,620
Oh, it's over there.

1391
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,880
Look at him running.

1392
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:19,860
She's got the beam!

1393
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:20,620
She's got...

1394
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,680
Wait, there's more?

1395
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,520
Yeah, is there more?

1396
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,500
I can't think.

1397
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:26,900
Oh, I do apologize.

1398
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,480
No, I think he had self-ris.

1399
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,440
Yeah, he had self-ris.

1400
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,120
That's a bug.

1401
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:35,960
I thought it was on the phone.

1402
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,220
We're gonna shot from behind us.

1403
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:38,700
Look how far.

1404
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,740
Look how far he's shooting.

1405
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:40,460
Where?

1406
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,160
He's shot a late...

1407
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,900
Oh, that's like the charge thingy.

1408
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:45,980
Oh, he's right here.

1409
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,880
Oh, I don't know.

1410
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:52,500
I don't know.

1411
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:57,080
I don't know what the lead time is for this.

1412
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,940
Wait, I'm going to grab this other.

1413
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:05,540
Yeah, my other car is in fire, so I don't trust, like, myself driving over there.

1414
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,160
86.

1415
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,160
All the other cars are out of range.

1416
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,680
Wait, our teammates just left us, bro.

1417
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:14,520
Pick us up.

1418
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,940
Yeah, pick us up.

1419
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:16,940
My car is on fire.

1420
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:22,280
Wait, there's another car over there.

1421
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,020
Oh no, that's our teammate's car.

1422
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:25,860
I'll drive that car onto them.

1423
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,320
Give me a sec.

1424
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,580
I'm driving that car.

1425
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:29,660
Someone's driving, right?

1426
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,180
I don't know.

1427
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,300
I don't know.

1428
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,540
I want to take that car and drive him over.

1429
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,300
Oh no, that car's on fire.

1430
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,060
Never mind, our teammate's car is on fire.

1431
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,660
It's not a good idea to pick that car up.

1432
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,680
Oh yeah, I got someone's can.

1433
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:44,800
Oh they're in this building.

1434
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,060
Oh my god, okay.

1435
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:46,720
No!

1436
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,020
Right there.

1437
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:50,360
Poor guy, dude.

1438
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,620
You stabbed someone here, yeah, I know.

1439
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,420
That's why I'm like trying to figure out where he is.

1440
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:55,640
I don't see anyone.

1441
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,280
Try to blow it, hiding.

1442
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,040
Oh, I see him, I see him.

1443
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,560
An Octa is falling.

1444
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,760
That's full team, so it's the only team he's right in front of us.

1445
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,660
Yeah, it is.

1446
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,440

You know what happened?

And I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm going to call a technical timeout.

1490
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,800
They declined my friend requested.

01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,780
They declined my friend request.

1492
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,260
Double-click technical timeout.

1493
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:32,420
My mouse double-click on the, on the, on the, when I hit my screen, double-click, it showed the, it showed the hide screen, and then unshowed it.

01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,220
It's, it's okay.

1495
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,580
Technical timeout, not my fault.

1496
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:35,500
It's okay.

1497
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,440
I think they didn't have time for a sniper to join.

1498
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:40,880
Not my fault.

1499
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:41,980
Kind of my fault.

1500
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:43,140
Player 2 hates me.

1501
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,820
I'm going to friend this player until they become my friend.

1502
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,500
Can you stop Harassing everyone in the lobby?

1503
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,000
Be my friend.

1504
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,160
And player 3, 2.

1505
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,140
Oh, player 3 became my friend!

1506
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:58,260
Player 3!

1507
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,980
Why player 2 hates me?

1508
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,080
How do you keep...

1509
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:01,980
How do you add people from the lobby?

1510
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,780
Why can't they be my friend?

1511
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,140
Well, do you click manage friend?

1512
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:10,680
Wait, is the Dialocord, the other streamer?

1513
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:11,540
I'm gonna friend them.

1514
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:11,800
Yeah.

1515
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,760
They're my friend now.

1516
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,880
Accept my friend, will you please?

1517
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:17,780
How do you add people?

1518
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,760
You click on their picture and then you just add them.

1519
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,200
You click on their profile picture.

1520
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,500
Oh, so some of these people already added fun.

1521
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,220
Yeah, you're my friend.

1522
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:31,920
I'm adding.

1523
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:32,720
I'm adding player.

1524
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,980
Player two always declines my friend request.

1525
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:35,980
I don't understand.

1526
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,200
I don't think they like you.

1527
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,580
I'm a report player two.

1528
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,640
If you don't be my friend, I'll report you.

1529
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,020
Complain to the devs.

1530
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,240
Devs!

1531
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,460
Force them to be my friend!

1532
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:55,200
Where are you?

1533
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,000
Or there's gonna be problems.

1534
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,460
Yeah, add me or there'll be problems.

1535
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:07,720
Recon.

1536
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:08,360
Recon's wrong.

1537
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,860
I like her.

1538
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,180
Player 3, like, is friends with me, but player 2 doesn't want to be my friend.

1539
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:19,000
You do realize it's a different person every single time, right?

1540
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:21,980
Yeah, every single time, they decline my friend request.

1541
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:28,580
Maybe maybe like they're like they're just getting unlucky, like getting haters.

1542
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:29,760
I don't understand.

1543
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,600
Why be on my team?

1544
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,140
Because they want to win, I guess.

1545
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,400
I guess they want to be on your team.

1546
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,220
They're on my friend's list, though.

1547
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,460
No, there's no way.

1548
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,200
I play 2 is definitely not on your friend's list.

1549
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:42,820
No, they're not.

1550
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:43,260
No, they're not.

1551
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:44,720
Send me a screenshot right now.

1552
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,100

1553
01:28:47,020 --> 01:29:05,480

1555
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,280
How are people already dead?

1556
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,320
We just spawned.

1557
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:23,480

1558
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,520

01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,700
You want to land in containers over there?

1564
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,520
I'm dropping.

1565
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:41,140
On top of the containers is a ton of good loot.

1566
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:42,680
Okay.

1567
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,260

I don't like the LMGs.

1575
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,500
I don't think they're very good.

1576
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:09,220
You know, like, like, if SureFour was here, like, I think we'd just be, like, wiping the lobby and lessen.

1577
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,940
Yeah, I don't think it would have been really fair.

1578
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,940
By the way, guys, SureFour was...

1579
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:30,020

01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:51,180

Yeah, I got headshot instantly.

1591
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,080

You're not doing it.

1619
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,060
You're just carrying him.

1620
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,780
You gotta break the shield first.

1621
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:39,680
Hello.

1622
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,680

You want to do a finisher?

1626
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,820
I was trying to take him over to you so you can do a finisher on him.

1627
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,320
So it's now it's just playing a baseball.

1628
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,280
Yes.

1629
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:54,960
That's your friend.

1630
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,980
It's called constructive criticism.

1631
01:35:59,280 --> 01:35:59,500
Reloading.

1632
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:00,340
Watch out.

1633
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,600
Stop running low.

1634
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,160
You're a clinker.

1635
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,600
Why am I?

1636
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,660
Why didn't you get your car?

1637
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,260
I don't know why you... Get back into your car!

1638
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,480
It's kind of messed up.

1639
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,240
What happened to your other car?

1640
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,140
There's another car.

1641
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:20,740
There's another car right there.

1642
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,860
I'm taking you guys to this car.

1643
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:23,880
Get your own car.

1644
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:24,520
She just doesn't.

1645
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,060
You just.

1646
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:25,620
Okay.

1647
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,520
You just don't want us in front of her.

1648
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:27,700
Yeah.

1649
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:28,740
Get your own car.

1650
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,040
You can't free load off of my car.

1651
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:33,620
You and player D are going to go this way.

1652
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,620
You're not breaking your car, right?

1653
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,220
No, you're not.

1654
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,740
You're barely doing anything.

1655
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:43,140
You did like one damage to my car.

1656
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,600
Maybe learn to drive better.

1657
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,160
I'm going to jump.

1658
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:51,900
I'm literally in chat.

1659
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,240
Me and player two are hanging out.

1660
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:55,520
Our player two?

1661
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,400
He's just messing around.

1662
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:02,870
Wee.

1663
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,890
I mean, there's still 10 squads alive.

1664
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:05,770
Oh, wait.

1665
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:07,250
There's a fight in front of us.

1666
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:09,010
I saw gunshots right here.

1667
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:13,370
Oh, yeah.

1668
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:14,470
Is that a human being over there?

1669
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:15,230
Oh, that's a bush.

1670
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:17,590
I saw.

1671
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:18,230
Behind us?

1672
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:19,550
These guys are speaking behind us.

1673
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:20,910
Wait, behind us?

1674
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:21,310
Oh.

1675
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:22,010
Yeah.

1676
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:23,290
Point.

1677
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:24,270
Oh, yeah.

1678
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:24,850
Big fight.

1679
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:25,210
Big fight.

1680
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:27,130
Okay, I'm gonna go over here.

1681
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:28,150
Oh, they're like drive-bying.

1682
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:29,910
It's drive-by?

1683
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:31,530
Drive-by.

1684
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:38,590
Wait, where are you guys shooting at?

1685
01:37:39,690 --> 01:37:40,130
Come on?

1686
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:41,370
Can I get a heal?

1687
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:44,290
The road, the road, right?

1688
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:47,330
Are you running them over?

1689
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:49,770
You think you're so hot.

1690
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:58,310
Hey,

1691
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:05,050
if it works, it works.

1692
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:09,630
Why put more effort in shooting than what I could just drive them over?

1693
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:11,490
There's a car.

1694
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:11,830
There's a car.

1695
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:12,150
There's a car.

1696
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:12,830
Okay.

And then they have self-rise.

01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:19,190
Just making sure I'm in peak condition.

1716
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:22,030
Oh wait, no.

1717
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:23,110
Okay.

1718
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:24,750
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1719
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:25,010
All right.

1720
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:26,250
There was some guy shooting.

1721
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:27,010
These guys still not.

1722
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:27,610
There's some guy.

1723
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:27,930
Here, here.

1724
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:28,950
There's a two team.

1725
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:29,390
Do you see me?

1726
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:31,650
This guy is one team.

1727
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:33,490
This is another team.

1728
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:34,150
This is another team on me.

1729
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:35,190
There's another team on me.

1730
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:36,590
There's Sam.

1731
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:38,070
I just scan that guy and I don't know where.

1732
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,100
There's another guy right here.

1733
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,260
He's behind that rock and then there's a guy behind the tree.

1734
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:48,920
Look on the road on the left.

1735
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:49,260
Look on the road.

1736
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,380
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at this.

1737
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:51,720
Oh, nice.

1738
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,480
This is the other guy.

1739
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:54,120
What then?

1740
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:56,980
God, he's dead.

1741
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,000
He's dead.

1742
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,660
I don't know where his teammates are though.

1743
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,000
I don't know, but let me execute.

1744
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:05,560
Let me execute.

1745
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:06,320
There's this guy.

1746
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:06,940
Execute this guy.

1747
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:07,920
Oh, wait.

1748
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,560
They're both dead.

1749
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,040
Oh, yeah.

1750
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:10,660
Execute this guy.

1751
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:11,960
Execute this guy.

1752
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:12,560
Execute this guy.

1753
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:13,880
Right here.

1754
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,520
Yeah, but they're not on the same team.

1755
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:17,960
This they are.

1756
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:19,440
No, no, no.

1757
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,800
This guy has three teammates on.

1758
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:21,280
Oh, wait.

1759
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,280
Over here, over here, in the house, in the house.

1760
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,020
Oh yeah, car house.

1761
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1762
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,240
Get over here!

1763
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,680
Get over here!

1764
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,620
I'm gonna execute again.

1765
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:34,040
Okay.

1766
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,140
Look at that map.

1767
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:39,740
Oh, there's the res, it's the res.

1768
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,800
And there's another guy over here, the res.

1769
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,280
Okay, you see them have one here, one here?

1770
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:45,020
Yeah.

1771
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:45,920
Nice player's three.

1772
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,140
I'm getting Ubered.

1773
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,160
Give me, I'm gonna loot this real quick before I...

1774
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:50,660
I have to go jive.

1775
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:51,900
All right.

1776
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:52,280
Yay.

1777
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,060
All right.

1778
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,260
Wait, take me to this car.

1779
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,180
Take me to this car.

1780
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:57,880
I want that car.

1781
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:58,880
Take me to this car.

1782
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,080
Take me to this car.

1783
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:01,340
We gotta get three-quarter car.

1784
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:02,120
I can move for now or what?

1785
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,180
No, so I can...

1786
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,580
So we can all run over somebody.

1787
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:08,460
All right, let's go.

1788
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:10,040
Oh, look.

1789
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,280
I was getting...

1790
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:12,440
Camped.

1791
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:12,760
What the hell?

1792
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:13,400
What the hell?

1793
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,740
Here, from where I'm handing over, I'm healing.

1794
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,180
Channeling source energy.

1795
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:18,640
Nice, you.

1796
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,260
But luckily it's on the left of the...

1797
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:22,840
Oh, and the hill?

1798
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,120
Running that way somewhere.

1799
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:26,440
Like more left.

1800
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:27,640
Yeah?

1801
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,400
Down here?

1802
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:30,200
Look where player three is.

1803
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:30,900
Look where player three is.

1804
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:32,660
Yeah?

1805
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:33,600
I was just left.

1806
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:34,740
No one took me out.

1807
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,480
Where's player three?

1808
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,040
Where?

1809
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:41,100
Oh, he killed somebody.

1810
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:41,920
Look at him go.

1811
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:42,540
He just thrown him over.

1812
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,780
I'm so proud of you.

1813
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:46,040
Look, see?

1814
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:47,740
All right, here you go.

1815
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,400
All right, where do we go?

1816
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,000
All right.

1817
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:51,960
Center zone.

1818
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,120
I'm gonna pick this.

1819
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:54,740
I'll grab us another car.

1820
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,720
I think they're...

1821
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:56,880
Ow.

1822
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,200
Can you guys stop that?

1823
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:00,280
What do you mean?

1824
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,340
I have the right of way!

1825
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,340
I have the right of way.

1826
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,000
They were the ones that ran me.

1827
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,340
It's a battle royale game.

1828
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,200
There's no right of way.

1829
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:09,600
Okay.

1830
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:10,680
Get that car.

1831
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,060
And then we'll all have four cars.

1832
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:14,300
We're gonna do a drive-by.

1833
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:19,120
Go pop, Alright, let's go.

1834
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:20,440
Okay.

1835
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,380
Oh my god.

1836
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,540
Turn the hoop off.

1837
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:26,800
Yeah.

1838
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,240
Somebody's gonna get on the news.

1839
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:35,820
Oh my god.

1840
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,160
One more joke with us and we lose this one more.

1841
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,620
What about this air job?

1842
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:46,520
Oh, shoot.

1843
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:47,220
Oh, across.

1844
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:47,760
Across, across.

1845
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:48,860
Where is he?

1846
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,180
Oh, he's over there.

1847
01:42:51,740 --> 01:43:21,900

1848
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,820
they're full of dead.

1849
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:23,700
Nice.

1850
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:25,020
Let's go.

1851
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:26,340
That's actually the strongest thing in the game.

1852
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:28,540
Yeah, exactly.

1853
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,280
That's why I said it was different cars.

1854
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:32,280
That's why I learned in the tournament.

1855
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:36,680
After getting run over multiple times at the tournament, I learned.

1856
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,340
I know what's the strongest.

1857
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,540
You remember when we were out of tree and we just got around the forest?

1858
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,240
Yeah, multiple times we died in the tournament from cars.

1859
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:46,020
Yep.

1860
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:47,600
This is what I learned.

1861
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:49,320
Now, oh, there's another car over there.

1862
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,640
There's a guy driving over there.

1863
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:51,820
Oh, they're doing it.

1864
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:52,100
They're doing it.

1865
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,240
You see how the color changed the blue?

1866
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:54,480
No.

1867
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,040
Oh, I see it.

1868
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:57,960
I didn't see it.

1869
01:44:01,630 --> 01:44:02,770
Car is meta.

1870
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:06,550
No enemies.

1871
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:07,230
No, no enemies.

1872
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:07,770
Are you sure?

1873
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:08,850
I think you...

1874
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:10,470
Maybe I didn't reach the right side.

1875
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:11,510
Because I think they're due.

1876
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:13,250
I don't know.

1877
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:14,470
Or maybe they did it.

1878
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:16,110
I think maybe they finished it.

1879
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:17,490
Yeah, there's no...

1880
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:19,530
No, I saw a car driving away earlier.

1881
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:20,130
That's the thing.

1882
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:22,190
There's a Tempest LMG here.

1883
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:24,650
Take it.

1884
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:26,910
Player three is very far away.

1885
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:30,930
I'm gonna need to find a new car soon.

1886
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:35,490
I need a new car.

1887
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:36,230
I'm running out of...

1888
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:36,810
There's a new car right here.

1889
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:37,550
Where?

1890
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:40,950
Up here?

1891
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:41,530
Oh.

1892
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:44,110
Nah, we'll find another car.

1893
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:46,250
Okay, this guy's literally driving on me.

1894
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:49,690
Let's go right side.

1895
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:50,470
It's probably gonna end.

1896
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:51,190
Okay.

1897
01:44:53,550 --> 01:45:20,670
let's see I'm heading over there's a new car down here oh nice yeah I'll grab that car yeah I need that car I'm gonna use up all the gas too and he took your car oh my god I used the majority of my gas for that there's a new car here wait wait okay I'll take that then I think there's I don't want the other side of the bridge wait actually I want this I want the the space car yeah this is the this

1898
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:26,670
I think they're doing this one on the right.

1899
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:29,370
Yeah, it's not blue anymore.

1900
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:31,990
Oh, there's a gold package, too.

1901
01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:33,510
I'm pretty sure they'll head over there, right?

1902
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:42,560
There, Jesus, shit.

1903
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:44,080
Oh, that's good.

1904
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:45,300
Yeah, they're doing it.

1905
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,200
It's red now.

1906
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,480
Oh, that means it's supposed to be.

1907
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,200
Do I...

1908
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,520
Do I need anything?

1909
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,640
Oh, my God!

1910
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,680
Oh, my God!

1911
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:58,200
Okay.

1912
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:03,660
Um, um, that's not good.

1913
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:05,680
That's not.

1914
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,280
So maybe we dome here and we res?

1915
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,860
Um, I don't think.

1916
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:12,660
I'm resing.

1917
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:13,100
Come to us.

1918
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:13,380
Come to us.

1919
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:13,680
I am.

1920
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:14,000
I'm here.

1921
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:14,580
I'm here.

1922
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:14,980
I'm here.

1923
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:15,660
I'm here.

1924
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,840
Can you heal him?

1925
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:22,180
Yeah, I'm healing him.

1926
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,000
They're throwing Stavarazas.

1927
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:25,760
I just don't know from where.

1928
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:26,320
I don't know.

1929
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:27,720
They haven't moved from their spot on.

1930
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,040
Okay.

1931
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,780
They're still up there.

1932
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:32,120
He's gonna use the...

1933
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,880
He's gonna use the ult, you know, the bombardment.

1934
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:36,520
Yeah, she did.

1935
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,040
These guys are...

1936
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,120
These guys know how to play.

1937
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:46,780
I mean, I'm worried about getting shot in the back though, that's the thing.

1938
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:49,520
Wait.

1939
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,560
We are getting shot in the back.

1940
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,540
We are getting shot in the back.

1941
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:54,060
From very far.

1942
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,380
They're really far away though, right?

1943
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,420
Yeah, but it's still not ideal, you know?

1944
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:00,500
I might have just rotate.

1945
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,260
I would just rotate, honestly.

1946
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:06,200
But I'm cooking them.

1947
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:07,460
Yeah, but we can wait.

1948
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:08,580
Now I got cracked in my back.

1949
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:09,480
Okay, we actually got to go.

1950
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:10,760
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm seeing.

1951
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,220
Bye Player 3.

1952
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:16,660
Yeah, there's another team shooting at us.

1953
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:17,000
There's another.

1954
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:18,340
There's another team.

1955
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:20,680
I like how you guys left me.

1956
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:21,100
I'm sorry.

1957
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:22,080
There's another.

1958
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:23,780
No, there's another card.

1959
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:24,900
There's another card behind you.

1960
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:25,900
Yeah, I got it.

1961
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:26,280
Okay.

1962
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:27,960
Where do we go?

1963
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,840
Let's go north.

1964
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:30,940
Where's north?

1965
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,160
Oh, this way, okay.

1966
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:33,900
You get this hill up north.

1967
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:35,260
Here, this one?

1968
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:36,820
Yeah, this big one.

1969
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,160
Five, there's three.

1970
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:46,520
Just chill on this hill and they're gonna fight each other.

1971
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:47,980
Hello.

1972
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,760
We're gonna win and sadly we can't get...

1973
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,680
Wait, do you have the orb?

1974
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,620
Oh, this is a new team running at them, right?

1975
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:54,820
Is there?

1976
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:57,700
I mean, a card just pulled up.

1977
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:21,980
that's good then we get distracted oh shit we got the we got that I mean oh I got him 76 nice I don't know how far I shot that from are they in his own yeah they're getting shot at right now by the way

1978
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:54,650
I want 10 on one what the fuck someone they shot me i'm just gonna heal real quick try for real i think they're gonna fight each other they are fighting they are shooting yeah they are fighting let the right team push the left team they just shoot at the left and oh knock one knock one nice nice can we break his shield and finish him and try i don't know we can pick this team up though

1979
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:21,990

1980
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:31,450
I streamed.

1981
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:33,150
It would be kind of crazy if we won four now.

1982
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:34,650
A little crazy.

1983
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:38,530
Oh, there was another team pushing us in front of us too.

1984
01:49:39,070 --> 01:49:39,970
Yeah, no, we were...

1985
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:41,510
Destroyed the last three teams that are gonna fight.

1986
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:46,930
Yeah, yeah, no, there's still three, four teams left, but there was another team that pushed us too, so we were not gonna live anyway.

1987
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:49,790
Guys, I think...

1988
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:51,770
I think... I think this was planned.

1989
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:54,850
I think this was planned.

1990
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:02,180
I had a plan.

1991
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:03,680
feeling we're gonna get pushed.

1992
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:05,040
There was no way we were saved.

1993
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,900
75% win rate is good enough.

1994
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,900
100% win rate would be crazy.

1995
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,620
There was, I know there was no way we win that.

1996
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,160
Those guys on the, what was it?

1997
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:20,220
The, the, the, the enhancer thing were actually pretty good.

1998
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:20,640
Yeah.

1999
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,640
It was impossible to push them down.

2000
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,880
This person's pushing with no HP.

2001
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,660
I don't, maybe they ran out of his.

2002
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,680
That was insane.

2003
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:38,700
That was the team that won the fight after we got third-party?

2004
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,420
That was the team that killed us.

2005
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:41,700
Yeah.

2006
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,320
No, they got third-party after.

2007
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:45,200
Like, another team ran at them after.

2008
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,100
After they killed us.

2009
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,460
So this is a duo.

2010
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:49,540
One turn secure.

2011
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,700
Okay, okay.

2012
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:51,260
Oh, no.

2013
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,300
This is the...

2014
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:52,840
This is last.

2015
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:53,340
Yeah.

2016
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:53,940
Last the team.

2017
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:54,900
Oh, yeah, Otto.

2018
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:55,640
Oh, what?

2019
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,520
Goodbye, Otto.

2020
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:58,740
Goodbye.

2021
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,180
I think that look hard to watch.

2022
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:02,660
this one.

2023
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:05,340
The day?

2024
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:08,480
Doki, we finally reached a point where you were uncarriable.

2025
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,920
Okay, that was not my fault.

2026
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,880
That was not my fault there.

2027
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,000
I did so much for you.

2028
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:19,280
I even healed you.

2029
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:23,400
What did you say?

2030
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,520
What happened this time?

2031
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:26,640
Yeah, what happened?

2032
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:29,460
Doki finally reached the level where she was uncarriable.

2033
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:29,800
Wow!

2034
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,160
I was literally second frag around behind you.

2035
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:32,720
Wow.

2036
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:33,420
Yeah.

2037
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:36,060
I mean, also, just wouldn't be fair if we won every game.

2038
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:38,040
So RPR through.

2039
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,060
RPR through.

2040
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:39,960
Yeah, we won three out of four.

2041
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,000
I think that's good enough.

2042
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,360
Let other people win one.

2043
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,740
You know, we're fair play, fair play.

2044
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:46,960
He just didn't want to win a fourth game.

2045
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,300
I'll enjoy breaking it down.

2046
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:49,980
You were actually too, too heavy this round.

2047
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:50,840
Wait, okay.

2048
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:52,440
Player two, accept my friend request.

2049
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:53,760
Okay.

2050
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:54,940
Player two does not like you.

2051
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:55,900
No, you don't know that.

2052
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,940
You don't know that.

2053
01:51:58,580 --> 01:51:59,540
You don't know that.

2054
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:02,180
He'll eventually...

2055
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:14,200

01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,280

2058
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,200

2059
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,920
GG's games come!

2060
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:42,020
Everybody there, GG's.

2061
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:47,940
We purposely lost so we could give other people a chance to win, right RPA?

2062
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,380
You managed to flame like...

2063
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:51,880
I did not flame anyone!

2064
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:53,520
I did not flame anyone.

2065
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,300
It was only player two.

2066
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:56,300
Because...

2067
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,600
Should I throw it in the sun?

2068
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:58,820
It was...

2069
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:00,360
Removing ignorance and showing us the way forward.

2070
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,180
I just got a goodie bag if you want to watch, by the way.

2071
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,320
Wait, a goodie bag.

2072
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,380
Wait, can you give me a goodie bag, too?

2073
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,380
Can I have one?

2074
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:07,740
Can I give you one?

2075
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,780
No, can I have a goodie bag, too?

2076
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,980
I'm pretty sure if you asked, Dez, can I...

2077
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:14,460
Well, am I still broadcast?

2078
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,280
Dez, can I have a goodie bag?

2079
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:17,220
You're not broadcast.

2080
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:19,400
But basically, what you're going to do is you get a mouse pad.

2081
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:20,760
The one that I'm using right now.

2082
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:21,740
You get a...

2083
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:23,120
Wait, I'm not broadcast anymore?

2084
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:24,840
A little cheering thing?

2085
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:26,880
No, you're not on broadcast.

2086
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,660
The world doesn't revolve around you, bro.

2087
01:53:30,880 --> 01:54:01,920
Well, I could just be like, at this can i also have a goodie bag if i was still broadcast this is also a bag if i saw a bag right here you get a shirt i think you get a hoodie through and then you can actually bait your bag okay which is like oh cool i can't wait to get my hoodie bag as well guys oh take a picture okay have anything better to click on one second bear okay wait he just bribed me for a picture okay guys well

I hope you guys had fun watching.

2095
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:47,080
Um, I figured out the settings too, very early on.

2096
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:49,680
I had to take a picture of the cosplayers.

2097
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:51,160
Some things you can do because you're at home.

2098
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:55,680
I mean, they could turn my broadcast back on and I could take a picture of them.

2099
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,180
They could do that.

2100
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:57,940
It makes me wonder.

2101
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:02,180
Just how are these people?

2102
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:04,040
Choice.

2103
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:04,960
Oh, the character?

2104
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,140
I actually didn't play her.

2105
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,120
I played this character.

2106
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:09,980
Yeah.

2107
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,120
Thank you.

2108
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:12,900
Sorry.

2109
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:14,720
I'm sorry.

2110
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:15,580
What?

2111
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:16,380
What's going on?

2112
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:23,600
The cosplayer came up to me and said, nice choice for playing her character, but I was playing the other character, but this was just the default one on screen.

2113
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:24,120
Oh!

2114
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:25,440
No!

2115
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,600
That's so hard!

2116
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,780
Oh, you got a booboo?

2117
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:31,620
Oh, you got a booboo?

2118
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:33,740
Yeah, I got a booboo.

2119
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:35,880
Oh, that's cute.

2120
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:38,810
If our world is like a pale blue dot in the dark...

2121
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:39,400
GGs.

2122
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:41,380
GGs are everywhere.

2123
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:45,360
Yeah, I'm going to go head to bed, but GGs...

2124
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,800
Oh, we have fun at Gamescom.

2125
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:50,120
Yeah, I'm going to explore Gamescom and...

2126
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:51,140
Yeah, alright.

2127
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:52,120
Bye-bye.

2128
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:53,440
Bye-bye.

2129
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:53,880
Peace, peace.

2130
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:55,920
Alright, guys.

2131
01:55:56,200 --> 01:56:24,780
