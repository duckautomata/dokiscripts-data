1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,340
That's so dumb!

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,320
I know, I hate the 10 minute delay.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,600
I hate it so much.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,280
Yeah, by the way, everything I say from now on is gonna show up on the stream.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,420
If one of the 10 minutes are up.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,420
I mean, I've already been live anyway, so you're showing.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,240
Okay, cool.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,900
Okay, cool.

9
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,240
Anyway.

10
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,920
That's crazy, you should talk to all those people, it's nuts.

11
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,160
I know, it's fucking insane.

12
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,780
I'm so glad none of us are live, you know?

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,300
When I said all those things about those people.

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,460
You should have asked for all that, it was fucked up.

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,060
Oh my god, I know.

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,980
If it goes live, everything I just said actually went out to the public.

17
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,660
It'll be so over for you.

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,780
We're going to court, buddy.

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,420
Yeah, it'll be so over, especially for you.

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, wait, wait.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,540
I don't talk shit, man.

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,740
I can't handle confrontation.

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,860
I can't talk shit.

24
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,140
Yeah, you don't talk shit.

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,020
Yeah, I told him, definitely.

26
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,220
Okay, last week was different.

27
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,500
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,440
So, all you have to do is...

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,580
You already lied now, then.

30
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,580
You already lied now.

31
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,800
What else are you lying about, Wig?

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,700
What else are you lying about?

33
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,080
Listen, man.

34
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,700
They were jumping on my friends, bro.

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,420
I don't fuck with that.

36
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,680
They were fucking with my dogs.

37
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,580
I like that.

38
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,660
You just don't like that they're especially fucking with you?

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,160
Yeah, I also hate that just as much.

40
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,220
Don't worry, we'll be...

41
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
It was all in love.

42
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,320
You know, those guys know I love them.

43
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,360
Those guys know I love them.

44
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Yeah, love.

45
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,820
If that's the love that you're giving to, like, those people...

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,080
Oh my god, the things Wig says off stream is so...

47
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,420
Hello?

48
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:39,920
Hello?

49
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,080
The craziest part is you're gonna say all this and still get a fucking level 10 hype train.

50
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,860
By the way, for those of you in Wig's chat...

51
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,360
Have you guys heard of Twitch Prime?

52
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,220
Yeah, use it on Doki Bird.

53
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,080
Go to your search bar and type out Doki Bird on Twitch.

54
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,020
And then click on that channel and then use that Twitch Prime on your favorite streamer.

55
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,080
I.e.

56
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,340
me.

57
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,860
Oh no, yeah, Doki.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,340
Doki.

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,800
Doki.

60
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,620
Not me.

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,340
Totally not me.

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,780
Wig, why are you going off script?

63
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,900
We planned this.

64
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,140
We planned this from the start.

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
Wow, my bad.

66
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:22,840
My bad.

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm going off script because I'm trying to win today.

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Everything we did yesterday I'm trying to do the opposite.

69
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,160
Everything last week I'm trying to do the opposite of today.

70
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,260
You're the IGL.

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,420
We just listened to you.

72
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,840
What's that say about you?

73
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,760
You're literally the IGL.

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,280
Wait, those zones last week were hard though.

75
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,880
They were.

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
They were slightly difficult.

77
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,800
It's because, like, it's not run by tempo so he can't control the circles for us.

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
Where is this guy?

79
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,840
We have seven minutes left.

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
I'm a bit worried.

81
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,180
Now I'm definitely worried.

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,660
I mean, now I feel like he was hyping it up in the chat so much because he's just not awake.

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,340
He's just like...

84
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,140
Oh my god.

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,720
He's compensating.

86
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,760
Was he in your chat earlier?

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,120
Oh no, he was in the fucking Discord though saying, I'm awake, let's go, time to party.

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,420
Oh my god, yeah.

89
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,360
Do you think he took a nap?

90
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,840
No, stop it.

91
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,280
Don't say that.

92
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,280
Oh no, wait, wait, wait.

93
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,060
Do you have any, do you have any, like, numbers of, like, any...

94
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,840
I don't have his number.

95
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,780
You don't have Tempo's number?

96
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,600
No, I have no Tempo's number, I have no Hao's number, I have no one's number.

97
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,500
Do you have any of the TSM, do you have none of the TSM members?

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,720
No, I don't at all.

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay.

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,140
I think we might have a problem.

101
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,080
We might have a huge issue.

102
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,600
Did you DM?

103
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,580
Oh, you did, okay, you did.

104
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,640
We might, we might have a problem.

105
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,680
Yeah, it's a serious problem.

106
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,980
Oh my god, my stream's still not live yet?

107
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,500
Your stream is still not live?

108
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,860
It's been 10 minutes.

109
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,480
I know.

110
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm not live.

111
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,280
Oh my god, this was Tempo's idea too, and he's not awake.

112
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,220
This guy's a fucking idiot, man.

113
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,100
If he's not awake, I will actually lose my mind on him.

114
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,800
Me too.

115
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Because he's the one that's so excited about it every time.

116
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,740
Yeah, he's the one that's like, yeah, it's Casper.

117
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,940
He's the one that's gassing up every week.

118
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,640
If he fell back to sleep, I'm never doing this thing again.

119
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,420
There's no shot.

120
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,420
There's no fucking way.

121
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,920
I can't believe he, I think he actually is asleep.

122
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,820
Why would he not be online?

123
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,900
No, I refuse to believe it.

124
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,100
We can't get a sub because we didn't even sign up anyone to substitute.

125
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
No, he has to be awake.

126
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,600
Holy shit.

127
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm not playing this as a duo.

128
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,260
Why not?

129
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,820
Wait, it'll be so fun.

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,640
How far do you think we can get?

131
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,780
I think we can get past first round.

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
At least we can get past first round, you know?

133
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,280
Did he like wake up, like wait five minutes, see if he answers?

134
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,380
Just like, ah, I didn't say anything.

135
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,120
And just fall back asleep?

136
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,060
Holy fuck, dude.

137
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,100
We're code red right now.

138
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,200
Don't you literally reply?

139
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,140
I was like, let's go.

140
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,860
Oh my god.

141
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,340
There's a legend itself.

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,920
He's awake.

143
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
We're in real life.

144
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,620
Oh my god.

145
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Where were you?

146
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,540
We were freaking out.

147
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,800
We were so nervous about you, man.

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,160
We were freaking out.

149
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,280
I missed this group chat.

150
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,800
I know, but we thought you fell asleep.

151
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,200
Yes, but you never appeared.

152
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,180
Oh.

153
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,540
Yeah.

154
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,740
Where did you go?

155
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,680
We're all, we're like four minutes.

156
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,420
Uh oh.

157
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,780
Wait.

158
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,040
I was warming up my charge rifle earlier.

159
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,500
We're good.

160
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,400
Oh yeah?

161
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,160
But were you?

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,940
You didn't answer a question.

163
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,480
I've been sleeping for like 30 minutes, though.

164
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,180
What?

165
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,640
Where were you?

166
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,900
I was like, I don't know.

167
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,900
I was cleaning.

168
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,500
Oh my god.

169
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,260
I'm a good guy, man.

170
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,920
Jesus Christ.

171
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,820
You know what you should have been doing?

172
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,380
Warming up, bro.

173
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,200
What the fuck's going on?

174
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,240
Yeah, you should have been warming up.

175
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,340
I was warming up, bro.

176
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,600
Okay, good, good.

177
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,680
I'm warmed up now too.

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,300
I'm actually warmed up.

179
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm not warmed up.

180
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,120
Oh, what's warmed up?

181
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,200
Oh, yo.

182
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,620
Someone here's going crazy.

183
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,080
Doki, why don't you tell them what you got yesterday?

184
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,560
I got a new mask, guys.

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
It's so cute.

186
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,240
It's like blue and yellow.

187
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,660
Oh wait, with your new PC and everything?

188
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,420
No, no.

189
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,000
This was a different mask.

190
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,640
It's like a custom painted G Pro wireless.

191
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:23,880
Oh, I see.

192
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,440
It's super light too.

193
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,900
Have you ever used a G Pro wireless before?

194
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,320
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,760
My other one's a G Pro wireless.

196
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,440
But this one's too.

197
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,640
This one is number two.

198
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,100
Jesus Christ.

199
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,220
It's like my other one's G Pro is super light.

200
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,100
This one's G Pro is super light too.

201
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,020
So apparently it's lighter.

202
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,220
Yeah, they're pretty much the exact same thing.

203
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,680
No, no.

204
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
They're like three grams lighter.

205
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,400
Is that a hashtag ad or what?

206
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,880
No.

207
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,860
Sponsor me G Pro wireless.

208
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,760
Do you have connections to G Pro wireless?

209
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,840
Maybe.

210
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,340
To Logitech?

211
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,600
Yeah.

212
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,340
I was actually on, funny enough, I was on a Logitech box.

213
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,860
Oh, yeah.

214
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,080
I was on a Logitech box.

215
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,380
Oh my God.

216
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,800
Can you tell them to sponsor you?

217
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,580
I'm actually sponsored by Turtle Beach now.

218
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,300
Oh shit.

219
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,720
Can you tell them to sponsor me too?

220
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,140
Yeah, I'm down to get you.

221
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,140
Get all the sponsors.

222
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,480
All I'm saying is, all I'm saying is Turtle Beach today did tweet they're releasing new products.

223
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,020
And I might, I may or may not know what the products are.

224
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,500
That's all I'm saying.

225
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,080
Hey.

226
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,560
And they might be very, very good.

227
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,020
That's all I'm saying.

228
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,500
I do it for, I'll do it for less than he does.

229
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,080
That's crazy.

230
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
I'll do it for $10 less than he does.

231
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,540
And I'll do it better.

232
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,840
I'll do it for $10 less than he does.

233
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,580
I'll do it for less money and I'll do it better.

234
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,300
And I'll make sure I'll do better.

235
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,700
That is insane.

236
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,200
Turtle Beach goes to your chat.

237
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,780
It gives you fucks up.

238
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,080
By the way, Turtle Beach, my Twitch is Dokie.

239
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,720
My business email is DokieCanReadAtGmail.com.

240
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,120
Hit me up.

241
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,740
Hit her up guys.

242
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,240
Hit her up.

243
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,460
Hit me up.

244
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,140
Hit the girl up.

245
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,420
Tell me you have the code and we're now?

246
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,860
Nah, it's not out yet.

247
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,480
Is that out?

248
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,080
Okay.

249
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,620
It still says a minute 20.

250
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,820
Nice.

251
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,320
I didn't warm up that whole time.

252
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,000
Where am I?

253
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,980
Where's my game?

254
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
Get on your PC bro.

255
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,220
What are you doing on your phone?

256
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,060
What?

257
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,120
What are you doing on your phone?

258
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,840
Get on your PC bro.

259
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,140
Wait, that's your PC?

260
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,300
Are you on your PC right now?

261
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,580
Yeah.

262
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,520
What's wrong with your fucking mic?

263
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,400
Wait, what's wrong with my mic?

264
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,560
It's on your webcam, it's on your webcam.

265
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,260
I thought he was on his phone!

266
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
That's definitely not a microphone.

267
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,240
I thought he was still on his fucking phone.

268
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,300
Okay, what do I know?

269
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,360
What the fuck, what do I know?

270
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,900
You sound kind of the same, I think.

271
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,060
Yeah, you do sound the same.

272
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,860
What the fuck did you do?

273
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,680
I don't know.

274
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,800
My thing is on the fortune cookie.

275
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,360
I think?

276
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,800
Have you tried plugging and unplugging your phone?

277
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,180
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

278
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,140
I think I know what it is.

279
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,200
I changed my mic to... er... wait...

280
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,340
No, yeah, this is all set to default.

281
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,840
Oh my god!

282
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,580
Okay, there you go.

283
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,300
Now it's better.

284
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,600
It's better now.

285
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,220
Yeah, you sound so much better.

286
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,480
It's so much better now.

287
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,800
I was changing the audio on my fucking stream, and I was like, is this better?

288
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
It's the wrong thing.

289
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,160
Whoops.

290
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,200
Whoops, I fell down.

291
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm warming... guys, I'm warming up, guys, with my new mouse.

292
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,600
Guys, I'm doing it.

293
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,200
She's doing it, guys.

294
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,740
Guys, I'm doing it.

295
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,760
She's doing it.

296
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm so fucking locked in now, for real.

297
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,040
Here?

298
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,200
Here?

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,220
Here?

300
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm live now!

301
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Ten minutes later!

302
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,560
Hey, let's go!

303
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,480
Live!

304
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,840
Ten minutes later, they're gonna hear this.

305
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,140
Yeah.

306
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,900
Oh, right.

307
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,140
Uh... live now?

308
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,640
Wait.

309
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,160
Right now.

310
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,720
I swear, lockdown is like...

311
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,360
Oh my gosh, I can hear myself.

312
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
Hear yourself through what, me?

313
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,100
I hear my... no, no, no, through my own stream.

314
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,700
Oh, I'm still alive!

315
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,480
I was crouching and I'm still alive.

316
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,360
What?

317
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,980
Everything is fine.

318
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm locked in now.

319
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,880
We're so locked in, we're so locked in.

320
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,240
You guys can't hear anything, like background noise from me, right?

321
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,460
Nope.

322
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,500
No, you're good.

323
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,880
Nope, we're so good.

324
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,500
Wait, what?

325
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,020
We're so locked, we're so locked.

326
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,060
Yeah, we're so locked right now.

327
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,460
Very locked.

328
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,680
When is TSM playing right now?

329
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,680
Oh yeah.

330
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,020
For what?

331
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,060
Oh, are we TSM?

332
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,760
I was like, good!

333
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,540
We should actually do TSM after this, it'll be funny.

334
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,440
Wait, what do you mean?

335
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,540
We should just be TSM every time.

336
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,880
TSM CC.

337
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,320
Make them a fake name, like, we're TSM White.

338
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,940
Holy shit!

339
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,120
Wait, that's such a good idea!

340
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,360
People are like, bro, they actually saw the TSM, we just died.

341
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah, we should change, we should make a clans- wait, are you guys on clans right now?

342
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Are you guys on any clans?

343
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:28,980
Clans?

344
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,940
I mean, how do you join a clan?

345
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,920
The fucking groups, what are they called?

346
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:33,820
Clubs?

347
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,120
Clubs?

348
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Didn't they get rid of clubs?

349
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,020
Should we do a TSM club?

350
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah, yeah, we should do a TSM club!

351
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,520
Wait, no they didn't!

352
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,380
Why would they get rid of the best thing ever?

353
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,440
They actually got rid of clubs.

354
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,920
The best thing ever?

355
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,600
That shit sucks!

356
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,460
That shit was so useless.

357
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,480
But what the fuck, it's not useless to me!

358
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,680
It's overall just useless in general.

359
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,760
It's not useless to me, my opinions matter.

360
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,260
Did they actually?

361
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,800
They might have actually.

362
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,380
Yeah.

363
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh my god, okay, guys, guys, we had to name change, remember?

364
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,360
Oh my god, we did not do that, no I can't do that now.

365
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,440
My shit's gonna get so yoinked so fast.

366
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,380
Wait, oh.

367
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,820
But don't you have Steam?

368
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,300
Yeah.

369
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,320
Then just change it on Steam.

370
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,740
You can't do shit on Steam.

371
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,500
I don't play on Steam, though.

372
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,840
What the fuck is your...

373
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,320
They got rid of the thing.

374
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,800
That's why I do so bad all the time.

375
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,640
Shit!

376
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,840
Shit!

377
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,700
That's my number one issue, huh?

378
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,800
What do you mean you don't...

379
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,820
I play on an EA app.

380
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,300
You mean...

381
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,620
I'm an EA stan.

382
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,280
What the fuck does that mean?

383
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,240
It doesn't matter, we're still playing an EA game.

384
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm an EA con-diosaur.

385
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,240
God, actually this feels better for a controller on this, I'm not even kidding.

386
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,740
I don't know why.

387
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,120
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

388
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,740
You were like, we're gonna name change...

389
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,680
That's a placebo.

390
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,460
...and everything.

391
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,840
No, it's not a placebo, bro, trust me.

392
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,060
You guys should play Road today and just try it, watch.

393
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,660
Yeah, we are.

394
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,580
Oh my god.

395
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,220
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

396
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,220
No!

397
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,640
There's 13 teams?

398
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,880
There's 13 teams.

399
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh, thank god.

400
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,520
Okay guys, if we don't get past this, who are we?

401
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:20,780
That's even better.

402
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,560
Oh, wait, that gives us... what if we... okay, first game, we run at teams.

403
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,500
We fight.

404
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,320
There's no way we'd lose, right?

405
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah, yeah, we just run at... we just run at teams.

406
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,600
Oh, yeah?

407
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh, okay.

408
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,220
The only name I recognize here is Shops.

409
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,380
Who's Shops?

410
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,280
So we just run at... oh wait, Shops and Flake.

411
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,860
Are they in the same team?

412
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,740
No.

413
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,260
I don't know who that is.

414
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,500
They're on two different teams.

415
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh.

416
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,780
They play a lot of... they play a lot of...

417
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,200
Like CC?

418
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,000
I wanna say they played like CC shit when Pro League was still going on.

419
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
Gotcha.

420
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,140
Is that bad?

421
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,700
Good?

422
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,840
Bad, right?

423
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,280
That means we have two teams that are good teams.

424
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:58,960
No, that means...

425
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,320
Two teams that are pretty solid.

426
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,160
That means we have two teams that we can bait into all the other teams to just kill them.

427
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,460
You're so smart, buddy.

428
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,540
Alright, so are we... okay, first game... okay, how about first game we don't run at teams just to gauge how it's gonna be like.

429
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,260
Yeah.

430
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,960
We figure out the skill level.

431
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,920
Yup, yup.

432
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,920
We can decide if we're gonna be little rats or if we're gonna be, you know, a gamer.

433
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
I mean, listen, I'm down.

434
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,980
I mean, listen, okay, so what do we wanna play then, first game?

435
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,980
Well, I'm on Bloodhound right now.

436
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,760
I don't even know what we're on.

437
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,860
Okay, you can play Blood.

438
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
We're on World's Edge.

439
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,400
Oh, we're on...

440
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,860
Oh, World's Edge, nice.

441
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,460
So, can we play Fuse first game?

442
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,760
Or do you wanna play Fuse first game?

443
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,120
Let's go Caustic.

444
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,580
This streak I'm...

445
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,240
Let's go.

446
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,760
I just wanna know right now that this streak is...

447
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,920
This streak I'm drinking is absolutely horrible.

448
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,780
Beacons.

449
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,240
Guys, I'm so locked in now.

450
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,260
I feel like you're lying to me.

451
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,200
Guys, no, I'm so locked in.

452
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,900
I'm like doing my...

453
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,300
Why, why?

454
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,660
I'm doing my scans.

455
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,920
I'm shooting my gun.

456
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,620
And like, I just one-clipped somebody.

457
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,440
It's already better than last week.

458
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,120
Yeah, that's already better.

459
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
You didn't do any of those things last week.

460
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,220
Yeah, I didn't do any of those things.

461
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,180
I barely shot my gun.

462
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,560
To be fair, I went a lot of close range.

463
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,740
I did a lot of close range guns.

464
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,320
Uh-huh.

465
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,920
Uh-huh.

466
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,940
I assume we'd be fighting more instead of, you know...

467
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,740
You think we're gonna fight more?

468
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,100
I don't know.

469
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,300
I just, I don't know.

470
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,820
I was told that round one would be so easy.

471
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,620
And this, I thought that I would be fighting more, you know?

472
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, that's the problem here though.

473
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,020
That's the problem is that it is easy, just not really for us, you know?

474
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,260
Yeah, apparently.

475
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,760
It is the easiest round, but there is no easy round for us guys.

476
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,780
We're facing adversity every step of the way.

477
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,720
Like every step for you.

478
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,580
It's an uphill battle every round for us.

479
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,960
No matter what.

480
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,420
That's like a little unfortunate.

481
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,600
Not gonna lie, that's a little sad.

482
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,400
I love that though.

483
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Doki, get in!

484
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,120
Wait, we have the code?

485
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,820
Oh yeah, code's up, code's up, Doki, code's up, Doki.

486
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,100
He didn't say anything!

487
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,960
It's okay, it's okay, we're locked.

488
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,300
It's alright.

489
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,460
Alright, alright, okay.

490
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,500
Give me a sec.

491
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,420
I won.

492
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,540
Alright, now I'm ready.

493
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,640
I literally just won my control game.

494
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,860
Good for you.

495
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,300
Okay.

496
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,000
Nice.

497
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,620
That means we're gonna win the day.

498
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,560
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,000
That's true, remember if we win our control game, it means we win.

500
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,380
Guys, we have to win at least one game today.

501
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,040
Yeah.

502
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,420
Okay.

503
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,520
Like at least, even if we go out second round again, can we at least win one game today?

504
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
Okay, um...

506
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,580
Think about how exciting that is.

507
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,140
Best round to win will be this first game.

508
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,150
I can't promise anything.

509
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,700
Throw everyone off.

510
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,400
I gotta work here.

511
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,140
Oh my god, guys!

512
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,260
Guys, I have news.

513
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,600
Yeah?

514
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,360
Guys, wait.

515
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,280
Did Tempo leave?

516
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,440
Did Tempo leave?

517
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,500
Already?

518
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,860
Tempo, are you here?

519
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,760
Oh no, okay, wait.

520
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,640
I need Tempo to be here before I say it.

521
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,720
Guys, it's like really big news.

522
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,900
Yeah?

523
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,240
Yeah, it's huge news.

524
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,220
I feel like you're just lying so hard.

525
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,980
I hear you smiling behind.

526
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,440
Why would I wait for Tempo if it's not big news?

527
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,200
This guy has 100k channel points on my channel.

528
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,800
A hug.

529
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh my god, what is he gonna do with 100k?

530
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,340
It's so fun every time I get a new channel.

531
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:10,900
I'm like, I'm gonna come in these lobbies.

532
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,020
Everyone's just like, yo, what's up, dude?

533
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm like, dude, let's go.

534
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,140
That's the only thrill I get out of this.

535
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,200
Man, if only somebody remembered to do something, dude.

536
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,840
Wait, wait, wait.

537
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,660
Are we fucked, man?

538
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,620
Where are we landing, guys?

539
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,520
I don't know.

540
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,760
You're the IGL.

541
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,740
I just listen to what the IGL says.

542
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,860
Yeah, I don't know what the IGL says.

543
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,060
I'm an indecisive IGL.

544
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,420
I'm an uncompleted IGL.

545
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,900
Okay, that's like, that's not, that's the worst kind of IGL.

546
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,320
I don't know what the IGL says.

547
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,100
I don't know what the IGL says.

548
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,320
That's why I stopped being an IGL.

549
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,960
I'm like, yo, I think this is right, guys.

550
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,920
All right.

551
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,440
Is anyone, Lavas, I mean, there's gonna be answers.

552
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,780
There's gonna be answers.

553
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,260
There's no way we, okay.

554
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,800
Oh my god.

555
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,980
Okay, here's my big news.

556
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,760
Guys, here's my big news.

557
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,320
I'm on the level four hype train right now.

558
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,380
On Twitch.

559
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,020
On Twitch.

560
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,120
You mother.

561
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,520
You're not even streaming.

562
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,200
You're not even streaming.

563
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,180
You're on the level four hype train.

564
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,300
I'm on the level four hype train.

565
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,360
That's the most used shit I heard in my life.

566
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,280
Oh my god, it's level 5 now!

567
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,840
It's level 5!

568
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,520
Hey guys, you know I'm live!

569
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,380
I'm live.

570
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,500
You can literally give me subs and you get a reaction.

571
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,980
You can literally give me subs and I'll give you a reaction.

572
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,080
I'll give you a reaction on YouTube.

573
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,840
That's crazy.

574
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,540
I like to put types in my chat.

575
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,100
Follow for follow.

576
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,320
You got no mods, sucker.

577
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,200
Yes, we do!

578
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,940
Mod!

579
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,560
I have a mod.

580
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,200
Your channel's not live.

581
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,480
You got no mods on.

582
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,520
I thought you did multicast.

583
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,720
No, I don't do multicast.

584
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,140
I don't want to split the viewership.

585
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,840
And also have two chats to worry about.

586
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,860
Yeah, that's true.

587
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,480
Did you get one split your viewership though?

588
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,520
Huh?

589
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
I heard a lot of people on YouTube stay on YouTube.

590
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,700
That's fair.

591
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,560
And also like Fucking tempo.

592
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,500
Mods, fandoms, chat, advertising.

593
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,840
Also, I just feel like it's just too much to work to handle two chats at the same time.

594
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,740
I'd rather handle just one chat.

595
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,620
That's loud.

596
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,180
Yeah.

597
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,680
Oh my god.

598
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,440
Thank you guys!

599
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
Thank you for all the gifted subs on Twitch!

600
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
Oh my god, you guys shouldn't have.

601
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,200
Wait, wait, wait.

602
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,340
Do you guys know where we're going?

603
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,260
No.

604
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,040
No, where are we going?

605
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,420
I don't know.

606
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,580
Do we not claim anything?

607
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,340
No, we didn't claim a single thing.

608
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,760
No, I was waiting for Tempo to claim something.

609
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,480
Oh.

610
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,440
I just trust you, bro.

611
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,080
I just trust you.

612
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:58,890
Alright.

613
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,310
Is there any place you want to go?

614
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,010
Like, Syphon?

615
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,190
I just typed Syphon, so I said fuck it.

616
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,330
Wait.

617
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,930
I don't know if anyone's there.

618
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,630
Wait, what's your hype train record?

619
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,990
I have no idea, actually.

620
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,670
Okay, here's how you can find it.

621
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,110
You go...

622
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,550
How do you check it?

623
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,630
Okay, you... okay, let me...

624
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,570
No, because you're gonna make it a gold of B-Bot!

625
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,630
You little shit.

626
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,190
You little shit.

627
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,450
I should just type that.

628
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,710
Can we break our record?

629
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,270
Can we break Wig's record?

630
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:30,670
Oh, she's using you.

631
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,150
She's not using you to get that train up.

632
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:33,490
She's using you to get that train up.

633
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,510
Alright, how did it look?

634
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,970
Oh, she took up a hype train record.

635
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,510
Okay, how to know your hype train is activated.

636
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,590
How do you know your hype train record?

637
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,890
I don't think there's a... I don't think there's anything that tells you.

638
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,910
How...

639
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,870
How to figure out...

640
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,070
Your hype train record?

641
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,710
Yo, yo, yo, we're live.

642
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,810
Oh my god, we're in game.

643
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,290
We're in game now.

644
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,630
We're in game.

645
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:57,630
We're in game now.

646
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,130
Oh shit, okay.

647
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,990
Sorry, this one... this thing was more important.

648
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:11,340
I got my bot in Doki's channel Are you playing Fuse or Caustic?

649
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, I'm playing Blood.

650
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
I practiced Blood yesterday.

651
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,300
Don't worry.

652
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm locked in guys.

653
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,020
I'm going to play a Valk for the Rotate Sin.

654
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,420
I'm going to play a Valk for the Rotate Sin.

655
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,180
I'm going to play a Valk for the Rotate Sin.

656
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,300
I believe in us.

657
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,880
I believe in us too.

658
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,640
What's the worst that could happen?

659
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,440
Nothing.

660
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,620
Backup plan.

661
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,160
If someone goes Syphon, we either go Tree or Launch Site.

662
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,080
They both have the thingy too.

663
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
If someone just decides to come Syphon.

664
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,840
I feel like someone is going to be both.

665
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm trusting you with the flight too.

666
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,960
I'm trusting both of you because I just tabbed out.

667
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,600
I just tabbed out.

668
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,360
Why does it look like there are two teams right beside us?

669
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,240
I don't know.

670
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,320
Oh shit!

671
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
Go left!

672
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,820
Is this just like Evan tempo?

673
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,420
That's exactly what Evan taught me.

674
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,880
There's no one here.

675
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,020
Jesus Christ, what a start.

676
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,320
Guys, I don't know.

677
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,960
I have two destructor rounds.

678
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,940
You guys keep it in the middle.

679
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
We have both beacons.

680
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,860
This is perfect, guys.

681
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,700
At first I thought like maybe we're going to do this.

682
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,120
Now I don't know after that.

683
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,320
No, I mean...

684
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,260
I'm more locked in today than I was last week.

685
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,760
I'll tell you how much.

686
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,420
What the fuck?

687
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,520
What the fuck happened last week?

688
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,180
What the fuck, man?

689
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,100
What the fuck?

690
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,900
If you were locked in the first week...

691
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,200
If we were in last week, we would have won.

692
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,520
Yeah, if you were locked in, we would have to do this again.

693
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,780
No, I was locked in just now.

694
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,720
I was locked.

695
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,300
We would have to do this again if you were locked in last week.

696
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,180
Oh my God.

697
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,780
We're a team here, guys.

698
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,140
We were going to compete about our win.

699
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,320
Yeah, but you weren't thinking about the team when you weren't locked in.

700
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,100
I was like this coach right now.

701
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
I was knocking on your guys' house.

702
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,480
I was knocking.

703
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,780
Check fucking mate, bitch.

704
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,920
Yeah, that's my fault.

705
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,760
That's on me.

706
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,340
That's my bad.

707
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,800
There's a havoc here.

708
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,420
If anyone wants in.

709
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,400
I'm actually kind of solid right now.

710
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm both.

711
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,260
Oh, yo.

712
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,180
We got a staggy.

713
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Yeah, we can go fast too if we need as well.

714
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,120
All right.

715
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,420
I'm at 6x.

716
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,480
Does anyone want the 6x?

717
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,580
No, I'm good.

718
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,820
Where's the thing?

719
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,600
The beacon?

720
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,460
No, the...

721
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,180
I dropped a charge rifle with the...

722
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,260
Okay.

723
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,420
Are you okay?

724
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,340
Evil cash.

725
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,040
He's talking about the evil cash.

726
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

727
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,180
I'm going to go scan the...

728
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,480
The brain just turned off.

729
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm just going to scan the people.

730
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,340
Templar, I paid the charge rifle.

731
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,100
Do you have one already?

732
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,540
No.

733
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,200
Okay.

734
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,040
It's in this building.

735
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,440
It's clearly the first floor.

736
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,020
I'm not using it.

737
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,440
I'm going to get the evil cash.

738
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,700
If I die for it, just run away.

739
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,240
All right.

740
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,560
That's fine.

741
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,340
We cannot craft you, but that's fine.

742
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,540
I have two destructor rounds.

743
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,640
Let's get this together.

744
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,740
Does anyone have an alternator?

745
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,220
No.

746
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,480
Nope.

747
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,700
No, sir.

748
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,340
Nope.

749
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,760
I'm going to do the thing.

750
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,080
Where do we go?

751
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,360
We're going to go straight to stacks for sure.

752
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,220
It's going to be a stacks end game.

753
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:41,880
Okay.

754
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,940
We're coming over to you.

755
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:43,980
Yeah.

756
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,880
We'll just go from like...

757
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,400
We'll just go over here.

758
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,420
Just go towards this balloon.

759
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:46,780
All right.

760
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,240
All right.

761
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,400
All right.

762
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,680
We should be good to go.

763
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,800
I'm beside you a wig.

764
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,920
Why am I too low?

765
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,740
I can't really hear.

766
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,560
Have you ever considered turning up the volume?

767
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:58,940
Raising it?

768
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah.

769
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah.

770
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,340
Yeah.

771
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,260
Actually, I was just thinking that right now.

772
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,340
I was just saying like if that's a problem, you could...

773
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,140
There's no way.

774
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,540
For me, it's a very easy solution.

775
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,020
There's only one team at stacks right now.

776
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,760
Yeah.

777
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,120
I mean, that's so crazy though.

778
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,420
Why?

779
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,980
I mean, I guess because we could take this fight if we wanted to.

780
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,640
Yeah, I'm not against it.

781
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,160
Let's see.

782
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,860
Then we die 13th, which is first.

783
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,200
Yeah.

784
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,240
Yeah, one point already, guys.

785
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,500
Where do we go?

786
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,000
Where do we go?

787
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,420
Where do we go?

788
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,740
What do you mean already?

789
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,280
Well, you're going first?

790
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah, you guys...

791
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,360
Don't worry, guys.

793
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,220
We're going here, right?

794
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:32,760
Yeah.

795
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,400
Don't worry.

796
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,000
The bloodhound will go first, scat, and then die.

797
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,140
Yeah.

798
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,520
I can't scan when I'm in the air.

799
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,300
What do you mean?

800
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,320
What kind of flying was that?

801
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,040
I was scared.

802
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,780
I didn't want to have cover.

803
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,200
I was so scared.

804
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,980
Oh god, I'm very bad at this.

805
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,400
Ready?

806
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,000
3, 2, 1.

807
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,200
Nice slide.

808
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,180
Are we grabbing this thingy?

809
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,700
No.

810
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,020
Just come here.

811
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,660
And then we'll grab it if we're able to.

812
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,260
Look, people.

813
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,500
They're going mod, which I don't agree with.

814
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,320
I'd rather just play from here.

815
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,020
Oh yeah, we can scan the people beacon and I can scan the beacon beacon.

816
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,140
I don't know if it's safe to scan.

817
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,560
Is it safe to scan?

818
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,640
Yo, someone else landed.

819
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,380
Other building.

820
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,700
Oh, they're in the other one.

821
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,680
We're good.

822
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,900
We just play from here, I think.

823
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,240
I don't know if it's gonna pull back side, but I'd rather be up here for the Valkyrie.

824
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,840
Who's gonna look at this team over there?

825
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,560
Uh...

826
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,300
I'll look over there.

827
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,420
I'm just gonna look everywhere to be honest.

828
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,740
Alright.

829
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,160
I have a longbow.

830
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,740
Let's get some shotguns.

831
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,480
I hope they don't shoot me in the back.

832
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,540
You guys need bats?

833
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,020
That would be so awkward.

834
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,080
Oh.

835
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,060
I do.

836
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,600
I have zero.

837
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,140
I have zero.

838
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,620
I just do.

839
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,360
Yeah, take that other one.

840
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,640
Let's tell them what needs all of them.

841
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,280
No, no, no.

842
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,780
I don't have...

843
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,700
If you guys find more shield cells, let me know.

844
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
I only have like five.

845
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,220
Oh, I got you.

846
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,260
I can give you some for sure.

847
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,960
I have five.

848
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh, they're gonna fucking take your shit.

849
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,240
I dropped four down here.

850
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,300
Uh...

851
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,820
This blow ball doesn't grab them.

852
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,780
I don't think it will.

853
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,280
I don't think it will.

854
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:01,900
Oh!

855
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,000
If they grab it, we run at them.

856
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,100
Yeah, I agree.

857
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,080
Okay, that sounds like a terrible idea.

858
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,060
That's a great idea.

859
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,500
I'm down.

860
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,340
Fuck those guys.

861
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,920
If they kick my loot, bro, we get after it.

862
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:11,800
Exactly.

863
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,700
I hate motherfuckers who steal loot.

864
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm taking a hundred shots of a longbow here.

865
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,100
I steal loot.

866
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,900
Do you hate me?

867
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

868
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,100
Wow.

869
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,520
No hesitation.

870
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,240
Yeah.

871
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,580
Very, very much so.

872
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,080
Wait, wait, wait.

873
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,020
Try and grab the Evo.

874
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,680
No one's gonna kill you right now.

875
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

876
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,520
Try, try, try.

877
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,640
I bet you no one's gonna kill you.

878
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,280
Alright, if I die, let me know.

879
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,060
I bet you.

880
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,720
I bet you like...

881
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:31,880
I bet you.

882
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,820
One gifted sub.

883
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,620
I bet you you're okay.

884
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,040
Okay.

885
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,040
Well, I'm already here.

886
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,640
I didn't really hesitate.

887
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,440
A whole one gifted sub that no one's gonna kill you.

888
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,760
What if I get landed on?

889
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,780
It's like, and then if you live, you gotta give me one sub.

890
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,180
How does that work?

891
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,040
Cause it's a bet, you know?

892
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,080
I won the bet.

893
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,420
I'm gonna deny that.

894
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,360
I won the bet.

895
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,220
I won the bet, though.

896
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,860
Someone kill me.

897
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,800
Someone kill me.

898
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,260
Oh, we're vibing.

899
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,320
We're so good, guys.

900
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,920
Look at our lock.

901
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,500
We're so locked in.

902
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,900
Yeah, we got our zone plan, man.

903
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,720
Yeah.

904
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
There's actually the highlight of my week, sadly, every time.

905
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,780
The challenger second?

906
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,140
Yo, what are you gonna do after this weekend?

907
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,600
What the... did you watch the fucking finals of the last CC and this is the highlight?

908
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,000
I know.

909
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,240
And the whole time I was like, damn, we could've been us, guys.

910
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,780
We could've been the... that could've been us.

911
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,680
It is gonna be us.

912
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,920
I just killed one.

913
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,540
Oh my charge rifle!

914
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,540
Oh my gosh!

915
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,280
Yo, I don't have a charge rifle yet.

916
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,520
I pinged the charge rifle for you.

917
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,020
What happened?

918
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,860
There's one downstairs.

919
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,220
There's one downstairs.

920
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,800
Oh, there's one downstairs?

921
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,100
I think third floor or second floor.

922
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm not sure which one.

923
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm in.

924
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,180
Let's go revenge.

925
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,000
That fucking smoked.

926
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,480
Whoa.

927
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,780
I'm trying to... slap me.

928
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,200
I was nuts.

929
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,380
Oh my gosh.

930
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,660
I can't stand up there anymore.

931
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,440
Where's that from?

932
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,020
Okay, front side?

933
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,760
Yeah, this side.

934
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,920
Here, I'll stand in the back.

935
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,520
There.

936
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,900
That's where they are.

937
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,380
It was not on third floor.

938
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,500
They broke your barrel, Semu, by the way.

939
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,820
Over here.

940
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,760
I'll break their face.

941
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,660
Whoa!

942
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,120
In game, bro.

943
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,980
In game, bro.

944
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,500
In game, bro.

945
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,520
You don't wanna get twitched.

946
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,040
Not that.

948
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,540
Bro, because I would definitely report you.

949
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,420
Oh, I found it.

950
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,060
Get your subs from my train.

951
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,400
Yo, does someone need that?

952
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,080
What?

953
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,840
The heavy mag?

954
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,520
No, I already have a purple.

955
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,560
What are you shooting from?

956
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,060
Bro, keep scaring me.

957
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,280
This guy is just so annoying.

958
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,040
I need to find a better scope now.

959
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,920
I found my charge rifle.

960
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,220
We're fine.

961
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,220
Good luck with that.

962
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,500
Yeah, good luck with that.

963
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,640
Bro, I don't think... guys, my eyes aren't working yet.

964
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,060
I would just keep scanning.

965
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,280
Oh, no.

966
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,240
Not this again.

967
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,920
I feel like my eyes... I see the frames, but my eyes...

968
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:34,980
Yeah, yeah.

969
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,480
They're a little half right now.

970
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,380
It's so bad for us.

971
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,000
They're not fully open yet.

972
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,540
What, how am I literally not having eyes yet?

973
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,400
It's not good for me.

974
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,340
I thought you had a scan.

975
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,040
That's why I scanned some...

976
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,800
Yeah, so she can see bright orange things.

977
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,700
Oh, God.

978
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,980
We're so buff.

979
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,700
I have no sniper.

980
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,200
I have a bunch here.

981
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:57,980
Oh.

982
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,060
I'm gonna go.

983
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,060
That'll be 16.

984
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,180
You got more out of her.

985
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,400
Oh, my God.

986
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,300
Guys, I dropped that and another bat.

987
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,160
Nice.

988
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,640
That's me.

989
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,660
Tom, Tom.

990
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,720
Found some loot.

991
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,300
Whoa.

992
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,460
Where are they shooting us from?

993
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,500
Oh, my God.

994
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,340
I knocked this shit all in.

995
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,700
Don't.

996
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,140
Oh, my God.

997
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,380
Get fucking shit on.

998
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,320
Anyway, how much meds did you waste for that knock?

999
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Not that many, actually.

1000
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,940
Only one Phoenix so far.

1001
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,480
Oh, nice.

1002
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,760
That's good.

1003
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,920
I'm gonna get purple.

1004
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,700
You think I can scan this?

1005
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:27,960
Yeah.

1006
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,740
I'm gonna do it.

1007
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,820
I'm gonna do it.

1008
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,860
I'm gonna do it.

1009
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,400
You knocked him.

1010
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,000
He's gonna be...

1011
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,660
They're so scared.

1012
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,100
Yeah, they're scared now.

1013
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,860
They think I'm shooting ice and I got my purple guys.

1014
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,840
Oh, nice.

1015
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,360
Okay.

1016
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,420
There is...

1017
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,600
One, two...

1018
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,280
Two teams.

1019
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,280
That doesn't have...

1020
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,880
These teams are slowly rotating in.

1021
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,240
Yeah, we're good right now.

1022
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,680
We're vibing.

1023
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,160
We just play here.

1024
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,980
Whoa.

1025
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,480
You missed every shot.

1026
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,120
Is he on the roof?

1027
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:49,960
Yeah.

1028
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,220
Oh, that was really bad.

1029
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,040
I was looking at the map.

1030
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

1031
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,360
Yeah.

1032
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,840
He missed every shot.

1033
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,580
He missed every shot.

1034
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,940
He missed every shot.

1035
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,480
He still missed.

1036
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:58,800
Wow.

1037
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,820
If that team over there is higher ranked than us, then there's a problem.

1038
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,780
There's a problem.

1039
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,840
In this system of Apex Legends, there's a problem.

1040
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,440
There's a big issue actually.

1041
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,840
Oh my God.

1042
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,440
We're at level 10.

1043
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,720
We're gonna break Wig's record.

1044
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,520
I'm so proud of you guys.

1045
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,380
Thanks guys so much, guys.

1046
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm so proud of you guys.

1047
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,180
Yeah, thank you guys.

1048
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,040
Thank you guys.

1049
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,800
Don't worry.

1050
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,860
Wig is not taking any cut of this.

1051
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,360
Yeah.

1052
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,640
No.

1053
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,840
I should.

1054
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,180
Where's my IGL pay at?

1055
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,740
Which is crazy.

1056
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,240
Where's your IGL pay?

1057
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,920
If we can't get it, we're gonna lose.

1058
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,980
We get passed round two.

1059
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,400
That's where the pay is.

1060
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,580
Is that in our contract, if we get passed round two?

1061
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:35,820
Yeah.

1062
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,620
I'm not going to fucking get paid.

1063
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:36,760
Okay.

1064
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
Yeah, you'd get paid.

1065
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,080
Wow.

1066
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,080
I'm not getting paid anytime soon, guys.

1067
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,820
I'm going to be looking for a job real quick.

1068
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,380
This is your job now.

1069
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,660
You can't break this contract or you'll have to pay me a million dollars.

1070
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,920
What are you doing?

1071
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,200
Aren't they throwing it?

1072
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,860
No, I'm just throwing it.

1073
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,340
Oh, hey there's a Watson team underneath us.

1074
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,640
Team 10 eliminated.

1075
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,440
That's not us guys.

1076
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,420
That's not us!

1077
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,540
Not us!

1078
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,380
Can I scan the people's... I can only scan it once, right?

1079
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,800
Even if it's a new ring?

1080
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,500
No, I think per round, can't you?

1081
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,840
Per ring, right?

1082
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,840
I'm not sure.

1083
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,440
I actually don't remember.

1084
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,220
It's bad that I don't know that.

1085
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

1086
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
Yeah, I can't do it.

1087
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:22,560
Only once.

1088
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,220
You have many...

1089
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,980
How many fucking games...

1090
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,900
What the fuck?

1091
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,460
I'm dead, I think.

1092
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,540
What the fuck?

1093
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,160
I'm running back.

1094
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,840
No, there's nobody near you.

1095
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,380
Where did I just get shot from then?

1096
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,020
Where the fuck did you get shot?

1097
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,120
I thought that sounded on me.

1098
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,580
Okay, clearly Wig's ears aren't working.

1099
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,380
That's why?

1100
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,240
You're scanning East?

1101
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,280
Wig's ears are not working.

1102
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,820
No, wait, wait.

1103
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,120
Is someone in that building?

1104
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,000
They have to be.

1105
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,440
Yeah, they are.

1106
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,780
Down there.

1107
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,400
Okay, okay.

1108
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,500
I'm gonna scan you for a second.

1109
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,480
They were definitely in there before.

1110
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,080
Tempo, what the fuck are you jumping on there?

1111
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
Tempo, what the fuck are you doing?

1112
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,140
They're to our left.

1113
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,700
I'm trying to 4-8-X.

1114
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,780
Oh my god, that 4-8 though.

1115
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,040
There's a team right here running.

1116
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,000
Don't worry, you can't catch me.

1117
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,080
There's a team over behind this rock, by the way.

1118
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,720
I got something to Southwest.

1119
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,940
There's a team in this building Southwest.

1120
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,940
I got 4-8 now.

1121
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,680
Everyone's dead.

1122
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,400
Nice.

1123
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,720
Oh, I just dropped off from so far away.

1124
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,600
Can you res, T-Rex?

1125
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,700
What the hell?

1126
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,300
Run away, Wig.

1127
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,420
Res now, res now.

1128
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:24,940
Don't worry.

1129
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,420
Nobody is gonna show up.

1130
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,340
Anyone have a Phoenix kit?

1131
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:27,880
X1 or no?

1132
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,120
No.

1133
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,980
I only have shield cells.

1134
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,600
They just literally all three shot me.

1135
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,080
I just got repeater charge rifle.

1136
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,480
Where are they shooting from?

1137
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,460
Like all the way from the dome.

1138
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,220
The team that he knocked at, they're very mad about now.

1139
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1140
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,700
They're really mad.

1141
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,620
They're really mad.

1142
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,680
I don't have... I just have like 3 shield cells, but I do have 2 bats, so...

1143
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,240
Yeah, I'm fine.

1144
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,140
Oh, there's team Portland right now.

1145
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,360
Oh, I'm gonna be there.

1146
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,380
They're in the RV.

1147
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,660
I see that.

1148
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,860
Oh my god, it's your favorite spot.

1149
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,800
Yeah, that spot sucks on me.

1150
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,340
What do you mean?

1151
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,440
We got like 2 second bases from that.

1152
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,600
That should have happened though, if we're being honest.

1153
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,720
Over here, by the way.

1154
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm running away.

1155
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm trying to shoot them right now.

1156
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,560
I'm hitting.

1157
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,600
I cracked him.

1158
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,140
I cracked 2.

1159
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,200
I cracked 3.

1160
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,660
You're such a fucking liar.

1161
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,920
I still fuck with you after you're a liar.

1162
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
One shot, one shot.

1163
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,000
They're one shot.

1164
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,440
They're one shot.

1165
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:19,760
Got one.

1166
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,100
Wait, over here.

1167
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,240
Where?

1168
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:21,540
Over here?

1169
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,140
I helped.

1170
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,580
I helped.

1171
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,400
Can I actually get the knock?

1172
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:24,740
Full kill?

1173
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:24,960
No.

1174
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,400
No, I don't think so either.

1175
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,680
No, they have room behind the thing.

1176
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,340
That sucks.

1177
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,100
Barely though.

1178
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,900
That blows.

1179
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,120
Good knock though.

1180
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:33,740
Yeah, good knock.

1181
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,300
I helped him, by the way.

1182
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,740
Yeah, you did.

1183
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,340
Yeah, for sure.

1184
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,840
They're dying up there, 4Tempo.

1185
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,660
You're actually a beast for that.

1186
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,560
They're getting ran at now.

1187
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,200
You're a beast.

1188
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,140
Oh my god.

1189
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,140
Oh yeah, they're getting sent out.

1190
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,180
Oh no, I missed.

1191
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,960
I am so much more warmed up this week than I was last week because I'm actually hitting shots right now, which is crazy.

1192
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,100
Wait, what does that mean?

1193
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,580
Last week?

1194
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,620
Last week I did harm.

1195
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,160
I did harm.

1196
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,620
Guys, we're top 10.

1197
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,720
We practically qualified.

1198
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,340
We gotta keep wall jumping.

1199
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,340
This sounds really good for us, by the way.

1200
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,760
We're chilling.

1201
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,520
Chilling?

1202
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:04,980
Okay, nice.

1203
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,060
Yeah.

1204
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,760
1, 2, 3, 4.

1205
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,220
What's in the pack?

1206
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,680
Oh, wingman.

1207
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,720
I need to keep scanning these packs.

1208
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,160
You guys gotta remind me if I forget.

1209
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,040
This team of big monies is coming too.

1210
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,920
There's no teams like next to us anymore.

1211
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,300
Yeah, we're good right now.

1212
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,660
I think they're only on the southwest side.

1213
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,060
Yeah, I think they went this way.

1214
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,540
Southwest side?

1215
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:23,860
Ashtp?

1216
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,540
Where did they...

1217
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,640
Oh, I see it.

1218
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,040
Now it's knocked on?

1219
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,820
Why does it take it so long?

1220
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1221
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,620
I see headshot.

1222
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,320
I see headshot on him.

1223
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,920
Oh my god.

1224
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,120
I gotta reload.

1225
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,180
I can't shoot him yet.

1226
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,540
I'm waiting for him to move.

1227
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,360
He's not gonna move.

1228
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,140
Yep, I'm watching.

1229
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,000
Hit him 25 again?

1230
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm just gonna keep watching him.

1231
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,400
Me too.

1232
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,180
Alright, I'm gonna look at the other directions.

1233
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,100
We'll watch him and then just make sure you can never clock.

1234
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,980
Yeah, that's what I'm literally doing right now.

1235
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,500
I'm not letting him clock out.

1236
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,960
This sucks.

1237
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,000
I think there's a team underneath us.

1238
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,760
There's people underneath us now.

1239
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,660
Yeah, there's like here.

1240
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,960
They're directly underneath us too.

1241
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,880
Oh, is that on us?

1242
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,340
We're fine right now.

1243
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,560
We're fine.

1244
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,320
You have enough barrels down?

1245
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:58,640
Right, Demo?

1246
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,860
You're good?

1247
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1248
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,080
I'm still watching that corner.

1249
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,780
I am too.

1250
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,240
There's a...

1251
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,340
There's a team fighting over here.

1252
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,100
He's still there, bro.

1253
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,700
He's still there.

1254
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,500
He's getting shot.

1255
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:10,680
Nice job.

1256
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,460
Someone else?

1257
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,120
That was me.

1258
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,360
That was me.

1259
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,220
I have over 96 headshots.

1260
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:13,780
Oh my god.

1261
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,040
Okay.

1262
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,000
I heard that thing and then I turned around and it was just you.

1263
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,140
Oh, good.

1264
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,500
You're good.

1265
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,740
He's a Wraith.

1266
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,580
Why isn't he queuing up?

1267
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
The one I just cracked was a Wraith, wasn't it?

1268
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,860
Well, I mean if he's not queuing up, then I'm not gonna be able to kill him.

1269
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,100
I don't think it's a Wraith anymore.

1270
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,620
Why is he queuing up?

1271
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,340
Oh, he went up.

1272
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,580
He went up.

1273
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,020
It wasn't a Wraith.

1274
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,640
There's a team.

1275
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,240
Yeah, it was.

1276
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,680
Oh, then why the fuck didn't he not queue?

1277
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,480
I don't know.

1278
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,100
What a fucking idiot.

1279
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,240
Yeah, what an idiot.

1280
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,580
I'm not really sure as to why he would not queue.

1281
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Why would he pick Wraith?

1282
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,300
Yeah.

1283
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:40,880
They're just shooting.

1284
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,080
Wait.

1285
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1286
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,060
On me.

1287
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,340
On me.

1288
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,520
On me.

1289
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:43,660
On me.

1290
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,600
Shit done.

1291
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:44,980
Shit done.

1292
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,080
What the fucking audio was that?

1293
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,520
Oh my god.

1294
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:48,520
What the...

1295
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,340
Bruh.

1296
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,380
There's no way.

1297
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:51,880
You guys are good.

1298
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,220
You guys are good.

1299
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,300
I'm down below.

1300
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:53,720
I'm down below.

1301
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,060
I'm down below.

1302
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,100
Play it.

1303
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,340
Play it.

1304
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,580
Play it.

1305
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,060
I have to get down.

1306
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

1307
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,540
If you all want to drop first floor, you can.

1308
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,960
Throw the caustic barrel.

1309
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,740
Oh, they got the caustic.

1310
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,880
You guys can come first floor if you want.

1311
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,280
It's up to you.

1312
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,440
Are they on first floor?

1313
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,800
No.

1314
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:09,980
No.

1315
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,320
They're not.

1316
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:10,620
They're not.

1317
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,420
They're never going to drop down and hit dead stick and fight you though.

1318
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,120
Nice.

1319
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,520
Probably.

1320
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,760
Tempo jumped down already.

1321
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,200
Doki.

1322
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,040
No.

1323
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,280
No.

1324
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,340
No.

1325
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm going to stay here for a bit.

1326
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,620
No audio, bro.

1327
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:20,940
Again.

1328
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:21,740
No.

1329
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,140
This is why I did it.

1330
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,400
Yo, honey's kids.

1331
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:24,860
I'm going to stay here for a bit.

1332
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,400
This is why I didn't jump down.

1333
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,280
No, it doesn't matter though.

1334
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,620
We were dead.

1335
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,780
You guys are going to get sent on the dogmas.

1336
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,200
Yeah.

1337
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,780
You're so fucked.

1338
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,980
Doki, live.

1339
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,260
Oh, no.

1340
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,060
Where is that audio?

1341
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,540
Are you fucking kidding me?

1342
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:37,880
Oh.

1343
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,000
They're evacing on you.

1344
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,760
For sure.

1345
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,020
No.

1346
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,140
No.

1347
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,700
They're evacing.

1348
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,260
Oh.

1349
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:41,920
No.

1350
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,300
They're sending you.

1351
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,040
Well, if you just drop down to first floor, you can grab both our banners and rez us now.

1352
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,420
There's no way.

1353
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,100
There's no way.

1354
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,440
Play it.

1355
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,840
Play it.

1356
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,020
Play it.

1357
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,420
There's no way.

1358
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm going to go to the path, by the way.

1359
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,500
I was sick.

1360
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,540
Doki, you can rez us.

1361
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:55,820
Trust me.

1362
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,520
There's no fucking way.

1363
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,320
I'm not rezing you guys.

1364
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,460
Play your life.

1365
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,060
Play your life.

1366
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,560
Play your life.

1367
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,860
Don't listen to that guy, man.

1368
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,560
Plug us in.

1369
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,180
Plug us in.

1370
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,020
Where?

1371
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,200
Plug you where?

1372
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,300
Wait.

1373
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:05,800
Okay.

1374
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,880
You're going to stand this white side.

1375
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,500
You got this, bro.

1376
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:07,940
You got this.

1377
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,880
We don't plug you in.

1378
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,320
Please.

1379
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,300
Enlighten me.

1380
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,340
Nowhere.

1381
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:11,800
Nowhere.

1382
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,160
Nowhere.

1383
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,680
Nowhere.

1384
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,300
This guy's an idiot.

1385
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,060
There's a horse guy.

1386
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,800
In the zone.

1387
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,420
I think you craft the battery here.

1388
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:17,680
Imagine.

1389
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,740
I don't know, man.

1390
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,720
I already have a bat.

1391
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,900
I can't believe they just three men took a zip line.

1392
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,520
I'm so sad.

1393
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,760
I mean they lived.

1394
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,400
Is it really a throw?

1395
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,280
Oh no, it wasn't a bad play.

1396
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,880
It was a good play.

1397
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,560
I didn't know what floor they were on underneath us.

1398
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,500
I thought they were first floor on us.

1399
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,540
I know they were right underneath us.

1400
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,380
Whoa, whoa, there you go.

1401
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,440
Whoa, whoa, I got the thing.

1402
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,640
Wait, wait, we got seven points.

1403
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,620
Is seven three points?

1404
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,240
Seven points for sure.

1405
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,140
Oh yeah, yeah.

1406
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,360
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1407
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,580
Go for it, you're good.

1408
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,160
Go do your thing.

1409
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,940
I mean there's no way we just don't qualify, so we're fine.

1410
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,900
I mean, I think we probably still need a few kills here or there.

1411
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,180
Oh yeah, we'll be fine.

1412
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm not worried about it, bro.

1413
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,900
We're no way we get top seven every game.

1414
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,880
Should we get three other games to make up for it?

1415
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,280
That is insane though, bro.

1416
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,600
I cannot believe that...

1417
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,760
They actually just three minutes in and I was blind.

1418
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,920
There was no audio at the last second.

1419
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,780
That was crazy.

1420
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,080
Wait, was the zipline going?

1421
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,920
No, I told Doki to scan underneath us.

1422
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,600
I don't think she did.

1423
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,160
I told her to scan underneath.

1424
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,080
Wait, wasn't that zipline the other way?

1425
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,140
No, no, no.

1426
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,680
From the roof to the roof or something?

1427
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,020
No, it was the zipline on the floor underneath us.

1428
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,040
I asked Doki if she could scan underneath us.

1429
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,580
I don't think she did.

1430
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,620
I thought they were on the first floor, not the run underneath us.

1431
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,240
If I knew they were underneath us right now, I would have told you to put barrels on the ziplines.

1432
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,000
Well, there was one barrel in...

1433
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,760
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

1434
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,920
It just sucks.

1435
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,460
Three men took it.

1436
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,180
Unfortunate.

1437
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,160
The team's alive here.

1438
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,660
I don't know.

1439
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,780
I mean, it's a pretty easy zone to live.

1440
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,500
It sucks.

1441
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,940
That blows, man.

1442
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,900
Three fucking men sent us in.

1443
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,460
And a bunch of shitheads.

1444
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,900
We can get revenge next game.

1445
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,640
Oh, yeah.

1446
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,440
Alright, I'm gonna use the washing tool.

1447
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:21,940
I'll be right back.

1448
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,180
Oh, man.

1449
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,700
Wow.

1450
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,690
Yo, yo, yo.

1451
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,250
Ay.

1452
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,330
That could have been us.

1453
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:24,910
Hell no.

1454
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,810
This could have been us.

1455
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,330
Hell no.

1456
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,950
Not a chance.

1457
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,550
Are they winning this?

1458
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,170
No, they're losing this.

1459
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:33,590
1v3.

1460
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,330
Oh, my God.

1461
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,910
That could have been us right there.

1462
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,210
We could have been that team with second place.

1463
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,570
I can't believe that I didn't hear any of those.

1464
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,550
I had no idea they're on the floor underneath us, bro.

1465
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,850
I cannot believe that they just three men took a zip on me.

1466
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,530
That is so unfortunate.

1467
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,070
Crazy Party's almost alive, too.

1468
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,090
Yeah, you almost survived.

1469
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,510
Wait a minute.

1470
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,330
We could have helped you there, too.

1471
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,490
Yeah, it sucks.

1472
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,910
It was just so fast.

1473
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,970
You know what's fucked up?

1474
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,430
What?

1475
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:56,630
What's up?

1476
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,630
I've been timed out for one hour.

1477
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,410
Where?

1478
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,770
In my chat.

1479
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,230
I wonder where you...

1480
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,170
In my chat?

1481
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,530
No, in my chat.

1482
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,830
Because he kept advertising his own channel on my fucking...

1483
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:09,370
Yes.

1484
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,790
...on my chat.

1485
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,990
Good for you.

1486
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,570
I look over and I'm like, what the fuck?

1487
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,830
All right, what place are we at?

1488
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,550
We're gonna be in like, what, ninth place now?

1489
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,710
That's mean.

1490
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,010
All right, we gotta make a new lobby, right?

1491
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,310
Yeah, there's video code.

1492
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:30,590
Yeah, yeah.

1493
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,030
Most likely.

1494
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:31,910
Yeah, it's snowing.

1495
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,030
All right.

1496
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,630
Oh, wow.

1497
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,810
Fuck me, man.

1498
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,290
What?

1499
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,370
What's wrong?

1500
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,630
I can't believe that's got three men sitting there.

1501
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:41,710
Oh, shit.

1502
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,270
Oh, shit.

1503
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:42,690
It's all right.

1504
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,590
It's because someone didn't change their name.

1505
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,790
Well, I should find the Lombo charge level.

1506
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,210
That's a clear indication of who they're at.

1507
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,330
We're in seventh.

1508
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:00,210
All I'm saying is, is somebody changed their name.

1509
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:00,810
Yeah.

1510
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,170
I don't know.

1511
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,730
Six people's first place.

1512
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:04,850
My God.

1513
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,070
Maybe I should have made a just nice rigged thief.

1514
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,390
No.

1515
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,310
Seven place.

1516
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,390
We do have a good team.

1517
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,290
We just need to have good, consistent games.

1518
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:18,690
It would be so sad if this is the fucking week we get knocked out first round and we get the easiest.

1519
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,090
Oh, would they imagine?

1520
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,410
Jesus.

1521
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,930
First round would be really bad.

1522
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,070
We're really bad.

1523
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,110
Technically, this is like better...

1524
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,930
Technically, this is supposed to be easier for us.

1525
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:33,990
No, no.

1526
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,690
The first round is harder for us.

1527
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,130
Round two is going to be the easiest.

1528
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,370
Round three will be the most difficult.

1529
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:38,570
Yeah, yeah.

1530
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,710
Round three will be easier.

1531
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,290
Round three will be the most.

1532
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:40,970
Round two will be normal.

1533
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:47,570
I meant like for this round one should be easier than last week's round one.

1534
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,990
So it would be very fucking awkward if you know.

1535
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,650
We did not make it through?

1536
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,550
Yeah.

1537
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,070
That would be so awkward.

1538
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:58,910
We are in.

1539
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,810
So awkward.

1540
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,690
We're in seven?

1541
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,910
Alright, we're fine.

1542
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,670
We're so good.

1543
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,630
Guys, literally we have to actually be the worst to not qualify.

1544
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,830
No offense, we're bad but we're not the worst.

1545
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,690
What if 11, 12, and 13 are watching your stream right now?

1546
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,630
That would be so mean.

1547
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,130
We got a lot of work on.

1548
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,270
Somebody of them.

1549
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,030
Somebody of them.

1550
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:30,810
11th, 12th, and 13th place are watching your stream and they just feel sad because you called them the worst in the game.

1551
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,430
Damn.

1552
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,630
That's pretty fucked up.

1553
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,630
I thought you were nice.

1554
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,390
I thought you were a nice person.

1555
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:39,550
Yeah.

1556
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,830
What happened?

1557
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,710
You've changed bro.

1558
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,990
You fucking changed.

1559
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,370
He started competing and then he changed.

1560
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,010
Yeah, you used to be a nice guy.

1561
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,590
What do you mean?

1562
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,110
Bro, code's up.

1563
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:53,830
Code's up?

1564
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,390
Nice.

1565
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:55,890
Where is it?

1566
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,130
Discord?

1567
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,170
Oh, okay.

1568
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:58,670
I see it.

1569
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,470
Oh, you were not ghosting us.

1570
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,390
You were just not here.

1571
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,070
We said good things about you.

1572
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,310
We didn't respond back.

1573
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,390
We said good things about you and then you didn't respond back.

1574
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:11,230
And then we got sad.

1575
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:13,870
I got a monster guys.

1576
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,310
I can't believe it.

1577
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,650
I stole it from NoCo.

1578
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,290
I'm getting bullied just like I was last year.

1579
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,050
What are we talking about?

1580
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,390
You changed man.

1581
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,570
There's no difference.

1582
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:30,270
We were saying the nicest things ever about you.

1583
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,870
And then you just disappeared on us.

1584
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,330
I'm an unconfident IGL.

1585
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,830
Indecisive IGL.

1586
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,690
There's just so much nice things.

1587
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,030
Why are you so harsh on yourself bro?

1588
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,550
We're talking...

1589
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,170
Bro dude.

1590
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,490
Why are you so mean to yourself?

1591
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,850
The first step is acknowledging that you matter.

1592
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,710
After berating me for like nine hours?

1593
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,550
Dude, why are you so tough on yourself?

1594
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,870
Yeah, man.

1595
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:56,790
What the fuck?

1596
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,830
Where's your self esteem?

1597
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,450
Where are you at bro?

1598
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,050
What's going on?

1599
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,810
How's your confidence up?

1600
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,090
You little shithead.

1601
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,130
Too bad you don't have a chat to the fact checkers.

1602
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,090
Not now.

1603
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:11,530
Not now.

1604
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,630
In ten minutes I will.

1605
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,750
In ten minutes?

1606
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,130
Yeah, in ten minutes.

1607
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,970
But you don't even know where that's supposed to be about.

1608
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,670
Wig and Tempo so serious.

1609
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,970
Doki shoots in the air.

1610
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:22,610
Cracked four.

1611
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:23,810
What?

1612
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,690
She missed like 75 shots and she's like, Cracked three?

1613
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,470
Oh my god.

1614
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,670
I watched the team she was shooting.

1615
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,770
I was hitting them and she hit zero shots.

1616
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,270
I watched it all happen in front of me dude.

1617
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,610
No, no, no.

1618
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,670
It was cracked.

1619
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,930
You know that.

1620
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,510
You don't have the POV on my screen.

1621
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,490
Yeah, I'll get it in ten minutes.

1622
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,010
Ten minutes.

1623
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,270
I'm pretty sure jokes on you.

1624
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,910
There's no rewind on my stream.

1625
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,570
You gotta wait until the VOD's over.

1626
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,030
Delete spot.

1627
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,790
You can't see anything.

1628
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,590
I hit them all.

1629
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,190
What do you mean?

1630
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,830
I hit all of them.

1631
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,030
You guys just don't understand.

1632
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,510
My chat's just spamming audio.

1633
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,670
Cause I just got fucking rocked in the game.

1634
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,250
I actually shit myself.

1635
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:17,310
I couldn't even know if I was scared.

1636
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,530
I actually couldn't even know if I was scared.

1637
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,610
I did not know there was a zip there.

1638
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,310
To be honest bro, I knew the zip was there.

1639
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,270
But I just had no idea there was a floor underneath us.

1640
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:25,870
That's my bad.

1641
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,390
You're the bloodhound.

1642
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,550
I didn't scan there.

1643
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:32,810
I didn't know.

1644
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,770
I didn't have my scan.

1645
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,730
Bro we should have those tag names.

1646
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,690
You see those people with the AES9?

1647
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:39,690
Where?

1648
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:39,830
Where?

1649
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:39,950
Where?

1650
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,310
Oh my god.

1651
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,830
For the third game, let's all change our name to TSM.

1652
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,190
Oh my god.

1653
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:47,950
That's so funny.

1654
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,390
People on the competitive Apex.

1655
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,430
They'll be like, Rick got signed to TSM.

1656
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,330
Wait, did you see the post about us a couple weeks ago?

1657
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,370
When we first announced it.

1658
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,730
They were like, this team is going to do awful.

1659
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,950
People thought we were playing these serious.

1660
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,910
I was like, dude there's no way people think we're serious.

1661
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,410
Dude, what the fuck?

1662
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,070
They were like, who's going to IGL?

1663
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,030
I understand how this team thinks they're going to do well.

1664
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,510
Why are they participating if they're not going to win?

1665
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,290
They're going to throw it.

1666
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:22,690
I remember I saw someone tweeted something like, these people are making fun of the competitive integrity of TSM.

1667
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,190
Yeah, we are.

1668
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,130
Yes we are.

1669
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,490
They're not going to take it seriously.

1670
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,090
Why are they joining the CC?

1671
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:29,950
Yeah.

1672
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,350
That just proves that if we do better than you, then what the fuck?

1673
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,690
What are you doing?

1674
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,210
Yeah, what the fuck are you doing?

1675
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:38,890
That's what I'm saying.

1676
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,090
The last time I touched Apex...

1677
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:42,550
Okay, that's...

1678
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,170
I played Apex yesterday.

1679
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,310
The last time I touched Apex competitive was the last Apex.

1680
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,730
You played Apex yesterday?

1681
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:50,510
Yeah.

1682
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,050
Why are you so bad today?

1683
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,090
I bought a new mouse!

1684
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,370
I bought a new mouse!

1685
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,610
Why are you so shit today?

1686
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,590
What the fuck, man?

1687
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,370
I'm literally on a new mouse.

1688
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,950
Like, what the fuck do you want from me?

1689
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:09,550
Oh, fuck, dude.

1690
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,450
To be fair, I...

1691
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,390
Three grams difference.

1692
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,730
Is that actually a big difference in mice?

1693
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:14,490
Yeah.

1694
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,350
Oh, actually...

1695
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,790
I don't know.

1696
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:18,990
I think I'm doing pretty alright.

1697
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,870
I'm doing pretty okay with the three grams of...

1698
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:22,610
No, you did great.

1699
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,430
They both feel exactly...

1700
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,050
I mean, yeah, three grams really throw off my gameplay for sure.

1701
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,110
No, no, throw mine off.

1702
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:29,510
She's right.

1703
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,130
No, did you guys not see the four people I cracked?

1704
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,310
No, no, I actually didn't see those people.

1705
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,190
I really gotta watch her VOD back.

1706
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,350
Look at my POV.

1707
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,450
I cracked like four to five people.

1708
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,930
And then, like, nobody cared.

1709
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,430
I'm so...

1710
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:46,210
Oh, wow.

1711
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:46,790
I'm so sorry.

1712
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,190
No, not you making me feel bad about a crack that didn't happen.

1713
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,690
I did all that work and no one cared.

1714
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,430
Yeah, no one appreciates me.

1715
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:56,890
Alright, wait.

1716
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:57,730
Who's going middle?

1717
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:58,810
I'm going left.

1718
00:49:58,810 --> 00:49:59,290
I got middle.

1719
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,050
I got middle.

1720
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,310
I need the thing.

1721
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,630
Oh, we got hot drop.

1722
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:05,930
Wow.

1723
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,830
Give me a golden charge rifle.

1724
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,290
Okay, that's asking a lot.

1725
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,190
I hope we find that for you, buddy.

1726
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,010
I can only imagine how big your smile would be picking that thing up.

1727
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,390
I can only imagine how big your smile would be picking that thing up.

1728
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,690
That's enough to make me want to give you one.

1729
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,370
Big golden stick.

1730
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,210
Alright.

1731
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:23,170
Whoa.

1732
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,370
Whoa.

1733
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:24,790
Whoa.

1734
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,270
You called it a big golden stick.

1735
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,090
Uh...

1736
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,030
Here's a 3x if anyone needs it.

1737
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,410
I'll actually take that.

1738
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,130
Where's the sound nail?

1739
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:36,670
Let's see.

1740
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,680
If anyone finds a vault and not use it, let me know.

1741
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,160
There was a vault in my room somewhere.

1742
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,060
Oh, I almost got run over by the...

1743
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,840
Guys, I drank some coffee now.

1744
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,820
I'm so locked in.

1745
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,340
My eyes are a little bit more open now.

1746
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,580
I got a blue helmet here for anybody.

1747
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,080
Oh, I was muted.

1748
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,240
Anyone need a gold heavy mag?

1749
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,160
Yeah.

1750
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,780
Me, me, me, me, me.

1751
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:09,860
Backpack.

1752
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,660
Oh my god, there's another...

1753
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,820
Is someone taking that gold energy mag?

1754
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,380
Me.

1755
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,900
Me, me, me, me, me.

1756
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,680
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

1757
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,660
There's a purple...

1758
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:23,960
Oh, a light mag.

1759
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,120
Alright, where's the evil caches?

1760
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,020
I'll get the evil caches next to me.

1761
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,920
Yeah, you're good.

1762
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,340
And then I'll scan the people scanner.

1763
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,380
There's a purple helmet.

1764
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,880
That'd be great.

1765
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,080
No, I haven't found a single charge rifle.

1766
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,820
I haven't seen one either, buddy.

1767
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,120
Sorry.

1768
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,440
I know it's tough for you out here, bud.

1769
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,120
I know.

1770
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,540
What are you gonna do with your life when you don't have your charge rifle?

1771
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,520
I have all the stuff for a charge rifle.

1772
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,800
I just don't have the charge rifle.

1773
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,160
I don't have the charge rifle.

1774
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,220
Wait, I found it.

1775
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,400
I found it.

1776
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:57,720
I'm rich.

1777
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,500
I'm trying to find him.

1778
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,260
He found it.

1779
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,780
Okay, that's gonna be a skyhook zone for sure, obviously.

1780
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,740
I think it's gonna pull probably towards the back of skyhook.

1781
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,660
Around that area.

1782
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,380
We had zero kills last game?

1783
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,740
Yeah, 7th place though.

1784
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,960
We had zero kills?

1785
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,860
Oh, kill smells.

1786
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,140
Oh my god, I cracked all those people just for zero kills.

1787
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,900
Just to get nothing out of it.

1788
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,400
Now how would people know I actually cracked them if you guys didn't?

1789
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,900
Yeah, I think that actually might be our fault.

1790
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,400
I got a golden ball here.

1791
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,040
I'm gonna scan people.

1792
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,480
Golden balls?

1793
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,120
Oh, I got a gold knockdown.

1794
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,800
Holy shit.

1795
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,680
We had to rotate.

1796
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,420
Yeah, we should definitely leave.

1797
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,640
I have the gold mag for you too, Doki, by the way.

1798
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,180
For what?

1799
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, the heavy.

1800
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:48,320
Okay.

1801
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,000
Oh, I almost fucking landed on the lava.

1802
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,100
Okay.

1803
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,560
I'm gonna drop it over here and we're just gonna rotate it.

1804
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,420
We could technically have a free rotate if we just go fast.

1805
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,320
No, we could definitely get this out of here.

1806
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:05,180
We gotta grab that one, and then we gotta grab that one, and then we gotta grab that one.

1807
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,540
I think we're gonna skip that and we're gonna go through Fragment and get that one instead.

1808
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,700
And then go through whatever it is.

1809
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,100
Alright, I'm here.

1810
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,100
Fuck that balloon.

1811
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,880
I'm here.

1812
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,420
Alright, we're gonna go through Fragment and then we're gonna go to Grandmaster Blue Vins.

1813
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1814
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:21,600
That's the goal.

1815
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,860
We should be able to hit this rotate pretty clean.

1816
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,480
I don't think it was gonna be able to...

1817
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,000
Wheeeee!

1818
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,220
I'm waiting for the coffee to set in.

1819
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,300
You're good.

1820
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:31,860
Wheeeee!

1821
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,800
Okay, we're gonna go to that Evo Cache and Fragment, alright?

1822
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,720
Alright, alright, alright.

1823
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,060
That's the goal here.

1824
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,420
We'll all run together.

1825
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:39,800
We're fine.

1826
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,860
There's gonna be no one in there.

1827
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,200
And then we're gonna go to Blue Vins over here.

1828
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,080
And get this one and hit people's heads and then Valkyrie into the zone.

1829
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,360
Oh my god, you're so smart, Wig.

1830
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,900
This is why you're our IGL.

1831
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,060
God, he has a plan.

1832
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,380
Wait, do you have your gold heavy mag?

1833
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,440
I do.

1834
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:54,780
You want it?

1835
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1836
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,500
Actually, did you drop it up here and pay it last for you?

1837
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:58,880
No, it's fine.

1838
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,380
I got it.

1839
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:01,940
Nice, there you go.

1840
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:02,680
Yay!

1841
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,760
See, my IGL cares.

1842
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:06,940
I do.

1843
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,000
I care so much about you guys.

1844
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,000
Don't believe any of those people that said you don't care.

1845
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,240
Don't believe all the people in my chat saying that you're horrible, man.

1846
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,020
They were wrong about you.

1847
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,900
They were so right.

1848
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,600
They're so wrong about you now I know.

1849
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,320
Yeah, you just get me.

1850
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,820
Never believed in those haters.

1851
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,200
Oh, never.

1852
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,240
Alright, let's keep walking up.

1853
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,860
We're gonna go to that blue bay to get that EvoCast again.

1854
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:33,500
Wee.

1855
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,960
Let's do it.

1856
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,760
I'm also gonna get rid of this.

1857
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,640
I don't know if I want to one or two.

1858
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,120
I'm dropping it.

1859
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,780
No, I don't need it.

1860
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,880
I need one.

1861
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,380
No, we're good.

1862
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,760
Two times?

1863
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,780
Oh, I'll get the two times actually.

1864
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,220
Sure.

1865
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:48,960
No, we're not.

1866
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,160
Oh.

1867
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:52,440
Yeah.

1868
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,320
They should rotate out of it like a way.

1869
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,100
They shouldn't find us here.

1870
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,760
Yeah, because they're like, oh, I'm scared.

1871
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,280
Woo, people.

1872
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,840
I don't know what they're thinking.

1873
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,820
I don't know what they're thinking.

1874
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,140
Nah.

1875
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,240
What else would we be thinking of?

1876
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,440
Well, they might not think it's us, so they might actually be scared.

1877
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,080
Yeah, they'll be like, oh, I'm scared.

1878
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,600
Alright, let's keep this rotating.

1879
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,420
You guys ready?

1880
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,220
Keep on moving?

1881
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,540
Yeah, I'm ready.

1882
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,060
I'm here.

1883
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,180
Alright, we're gonna get this EvoCast.

1884
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,740
Then we're gonna go people scan like they did.

1885
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,040
Then rotate into sky.

1886
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,620
Oh, and then I can charge rifle everyone.

1887
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,820
Yeah, when we get in sky.

1888
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,120
Yeah, we hit a Valko at the end there too.

1889
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,860
Oh yeah, we get right here.

1890
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,980
Oh yeah, that sounds juicy right there.

1891
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:31,860
Oh yeah.

1892
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,320
I love juicy.

1893
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,160
Whoa.

1894
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,080
Whoa.

1895
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,400
This is like a Christian friendly stream.

1896
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,500
Oh yeah.

1897
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,820
They're not riding us, right?

1898
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,340
No.

1899
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,300
Oh, you scanned already?

1900
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:46,900
Not the building?

1901
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,560
No, we didn't need to go there.

1902
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,180
There's no way.

1903
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,420
Oh god, oh god, they might be in here.

1904
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,740
There's no way.

1905
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,300
They left 60 seconds ago.

1906
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,500
Okay, nice.

1907
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,200
See you guys.

1908
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,240
I walked through the whole living and Ducky's like, yeah, we can scan that real quick.

1909
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,100
We're fine.

1910
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,300
We're fine.

1911
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,940
What are you so worried about?

1912
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,020
You're so paranoid.

1913
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,460
What the fuck are you two teams doing?

1914
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,620
The team already top sky.

1915
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,080
We pushed them off top sky.

1916
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,960
They might not be in there.

1917
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:21,640
Come over to me.

1918
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,540
They might not be in the top area.

1919
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,220
They might be on the bottom.

1920
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,780
If they're not in the top, do we just play one of these buildings?

1921
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,020
Or if they are in the top, yeah.

1922
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,340
They are.

1923
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,520
They're Dacia, Rampire.

1924
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,120
We're just gonna go four story here.

1925
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:36,800
Which one?

1926
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,340
This one?

1927
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,420
Yeah, four story here.

1928
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,620
Okay, I'll scan.

1929
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,240
We should be fine.

1930
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:41,800
I don't think it was in here.

1931
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,100
Yeah, there's nobody.

1932
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,980
I don't need to scan then.

1933
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,100
Yeah, we can all just rotate out if we need to.

1934
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:53,440
If the zone goes towards that diner side more over here, we're gonna make a rotation to the next diner on the right and then just keep walking through, okay?

1935
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:55,760
Oh my.

1936
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,640
Okay, I didn't hear what you said, Wig.

1937
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,360
What did you...

1938
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:08,540
Okay, so basically, if the zone keeps pointing to the right over here, which I'm not sure it's gonna, we're gonna just rotate down through these diners and just go through the first floor.

1939
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,580
I'm paying attention.

1940
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,560
I'm paying attention.

1941
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,220
Sorry, I couldn't multitask because Tempo was getting shot.

1942
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,260
No, it's okay.

1943
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:19,660
It's scary.

1944
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,080
Yeah, yeah.

1945
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,780
I was worried because he was on the roof.

1946
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,480
Yeah.

1947
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,560
And I was getting deja vu.

1948
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,400
He scares me the most when he's getting shot, we're being honest.

1949
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,300
Yeah, honestly.

1950
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,020
When he's getting shot, he most likely might die.

1951
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,020
Don't worry, I'm not on a...

1952
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,520
I'm in a room.

1953
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,840
I'm not on a roof, so we're good.

1954
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,340
You're really...

1955
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,540
I think your arch nemesis is a roof.

1956
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,160
What the fuck?

1957
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,360
What are you shot at here?

1958
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,920
Oh, he's like...

1959
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,440
I wanna fucking get rid of...

1960
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,640
Is that a fucking Watson thing?

1961
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,080
Good barrels down below, Tempo.

1962
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,480
Okay.

1963
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,300
Oh my god, he's being proactive.

1964
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,420
Look at you, bud.

1965
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,960
That's actually good barrels too.

1966
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:01,900
Let's fucking go, man.

1967
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,360
Actually good barrels down.

1968
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,680
What a fucking compliment slap.

1969
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,040
Whoa!

1970
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,160
Whoa!

1971
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,760
Tell me what up.

1972
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,640
Who was it, dude?

1973
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,160
Little shithead?

1974
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,620
Oh no.

1975
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,440
There's some people on the roof.

1976
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,760
They are on the rampart.

1977
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,060
They touched, and it was not fun.

1978
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,240
Oh my god, bro.

1979
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,560
Their setup is crazy scary.

1980
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,500
They're diabolical over there.

1981
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,860
I can only shoot this team now.

1982
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,660
The other team has a bloody rampart.

1983
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,480
Yeah, I'm scared of that team.

1984
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,340
Not gonna lie.

1985
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,000
We can't even do anything against them.

1986
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,720
I'm scared.

1987
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,060
I don't even want to fucking peek that shit.

1988
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,800
Does someone want my charge rifle after?

1989
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,280
Oh, no.

1990
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:45,980
I already got purple.

1991
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,260
Can I get that Kraber?

1992
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,100
That's really far.

1993
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,340
That's really close to this team.

1994
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,100
I know, but fuck me.

1995
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,220
Do it.

1996
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,060
If I die, then we are so fucked.

1997
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,840
Okay, yeah, don't do it.

1998
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,240
No, no.

1999
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,660
You can get the beacon, but you can't.

2000
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,640
I was just chalked.

2001
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,980
Shoot, fuck off, charge rifle guy.

2002
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,660
I'm just gonna hang out here.

2003
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:12,680
Wee.

2004
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,720
I have my purple up now, too.

2005
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,260
Which is good.

2006
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,840
How did you get your purple?

2007
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,660
I scanned a package and then I got shot.

2008
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,360
Oh.

2009
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,080
I need like 50 shots.

2010
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,320
I don't know who to shoot at because it's just that team and then the team, the rampart team.

2011
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,240
There's like no one else for me to shoot at.

2012
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,140
I'm gonna chug another.

2013
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,520
I'm gonna chug this coffee.

2014
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,800
I said that kid 106 might knock this kid.

2015
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,760
Nah, he's not peeking me, bitch.

2016
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,800
Little bitch.

2017
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:42,680
Nooo.

2018
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:43,940
Okay.

2019
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,380
Let's try and get this one shot in for that 50.

2020
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,980
Come on, somebody peek.

2021
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,700
Somebody open that door.

2022
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,500
Just think about me for a sec, team.

2023
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,520
Alright, let's see where this sound's going.

2024
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,220
Alright, well.

2025
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,800
I think I kinda wanna move right, but I don't know.

2026
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:02,860
I think we just stay here for right now.

2027
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:03,960
Yep.

2028
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,660
Oh my god.

2029
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,500
I'm literally fucked.

2030
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:05,800
I'm alive.

2031
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,680
I'm five away.

2032
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,700
Is there any way to get under these guys on the roof?

2033
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,540
Like in the middle?

2034
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,380
I don't think so, right?

2035
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:11,900
Under these?

2036
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,040
Oh, in the middle.

2037
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,580
Yeah.

2038
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:14,840
Without dying?

2039
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,960
I don't know if we could right now.

2040
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,520
We maybe could, honestly.

2041
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,300
It just depends.

2042
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,200
We have no smokes, which sucks.

2043
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,140
Yeah, we only have the scans.

2044
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:24,560
Yeah.

2045
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,540
And there's nobody.

2046
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,160
There's no one on there?

2047
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:27,700
They left?

2048
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,340
What?

2049
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,120
Which one?

2050
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,340
The middle.

2051
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:30,960
You scanned the middle.

2052
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,460
You didn't get anything.

2053
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,080
No, they're there.

2054
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,320
I just didn't remember.

2055
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,020
I did not hit.

2056
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,440
My range wasn't...

2057
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,580
They just low-balled us in the middle.

2058
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,380
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

2059
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,520
It's okay.

2060
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,660
I'm gonna use my bat.

2061
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,280
I wasn't paying attention, but it's okay.

2062
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,160
I'm paying attention now.

2063
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,380
You're doing great.

2064
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:47,780
You're doing great.

2065
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,180
Thank you.

2066
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,160
See, positive reaffirmation improves the player.

2067
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:52,660
Yeah.

2068
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,540
Oh, you're so right.

2069
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,380
You should do that to me more often.

2070
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,720
Well, like, it only works for certain players.

2071
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,360
Oh, so I'm not one of those?

2072
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,400
I do better game before I have a sub through, actually.

2073
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:03,980
You're so right.

2074
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,900
I'm a better player.

2075
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,980
I'm my role model.

2076
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,940
It works for certain players is crazy.

2077
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,180
If it works for...

2078
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:16,300
I don't know if it works for TSM, who's the number one team.

2079
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,080
I don't know.

2080
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:18,540
You're so right.

2081
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,640
You're so right.

2082
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,720
Oh my god, stop looking at me through the rampart wall, you freak.

2083
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,860
I need five damage.

2084
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,500
I'm gonna scan the top of this.

2085
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,220
Yeah, see, they're still there.

2086
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,260
Yeah, they are.

2087
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,040
They're playing really weird.

2088
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,060
I want to get this care pack in front of us.

2089
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:38,300
What is it?

2090
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,700
It's a fucking...

2091
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,000
Oh, I don't need to shoot anymore.

2092
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,580
Nice, I got you.

2093
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:43,960
I got you.

2094
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,080
I kinda wanna...

2095
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,300
Wait, how did you get purple?

2096
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,600
It's like he scanned another packet.

2097
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,600
I'm gonna try to get this one.

2098
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,180
Let's see if I can do it.

2099
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,000
Oh.

2100
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,180
It's gonna be really risky, actually.

2101
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,660
Can you guys shoot this building?

2102
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,900
Yeah, we're shooting.

2103
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,000
We're looking at them.

2104
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,940
I'm looking at them, but I don't see any of them.

2105
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,200
Yeah, they're not looking at us.

2106
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,840
I think they're here.

2107
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,940
I think they're on this fence right now.

2108
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,820
Someone just opened this door.

2109
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:07,820
No, they're not.

2110
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,600
They're still over there.

2111
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,620
Why don't you guys look over here too and shoot this team if you guys can.

2112
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,620
Okay, I'll go shoot.

2113
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,620
I'm shooting left.

2114
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:14,820
I'll do that.

2115
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,200
We need to get underneath these guys, by the way.

2116
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:17,980
It's okay.

2117
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,840
I closed this door.

2118
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:19,500
We're good.

2119
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,140
Okay, where do we have to go?

2120
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,160
We need to get underneath them right now on the second floor.

2121
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,900
Okay, okay, okay.

2122
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,520
Can you scan right now?

2123
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:26,940
Which right?

2124
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:27,800
Come to me.

2125
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,340
Come to me down below.

2126
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:29,660
Yeah.

2127
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,520
Okay, come to me on the first floor.

2128
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,400
Alright, keep moving right side.

2129
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:32,560
Come here.

2130
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,120
Alright, you're gonna scan the next building over to the green room.

2131
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:37,600
Over here.

2132
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,080
Okay, can we do it?

2133
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,100
Yeah, yeah, scan.

2134
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:41,420
We're good.

2135
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,320
Okay, we're gonna go that.

2136
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,000
We're gonna take it right now.

2137
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,360
Okay.

2138
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,600
Come to the first floor on the bottom right side.

2139
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,380
We're gonna keep scanning our way and just keep walking in.

2140
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:47,580
We're good.

2141
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,180
Just moving.

2142
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,660
I have a creeper, by the way.

2143
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,140
Nice.

2144
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,220
Alright, we're gonna wait for your next scan and then we're gonna move forward a little bit more.

2145
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,040
Alright, seven seconds.

2146
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,300
Yeah, you're good.

2147
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,260
Let's see if there's any extra loot.

2148
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,320
Oh, there's seven seconds.

2149
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,940
I heard a zip on the right side for sure.

2150
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2151
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,360
Okay, scan.

2152
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,280
Want me to scan this building now?

2153
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,600
Yeah, scan to the right right now.

2154
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,640
Scan both those buildings if you can.

2155
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:08,920
Okay, so there's split holding right now.

2156
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:09,900
There's split holding.

2157
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,400
So we could easily get in there if we need to.

2158
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,380
I'm ready.

2159
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:13,520
They're flying.

2160
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:14,860
They're taking the first floor.

2161
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,020
They're about to fight.

2162
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,860
Okay, okay, I'm looking, looking, looking.

2163
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:18,860
Yeah, yeah.

2164
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,200
Wait, I blocked our first floor.

2165
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,000
I know, I got it.

2166
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,200
We're good.

2167
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:21,360
We're good.

2168
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,100
They're like smoking now.

2169
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:24,680
Yeah, they fight this before.

2170
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,300
I don't know.

2171
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,500
There's another team taking a zip on the high ground here.

2172
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:28,780
Which is really good.

2173
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,140
Yo, dude just walked here.

2174
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:31,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2175
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,980
He just walked outside.

2176
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:35,800
I see them.

2177
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,140
Yeah, they're across.

2178
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:36,680
They're across the way.

2179
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,620
13 blue.

2180
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,120
He's coming across.

2181
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:39,500
He's coming across now.

2182
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,260
I can't look right now.

2183
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,760
Knock, knock, knock.

2184
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,140
I'm gonna try and thirst freeze.

2185
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:45,900
Yeah, you're good.

2186
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,240
Go for it.

2187
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:46,540
You should be fine.

2188
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,420
Where is the knock?

2189
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,420
We're good.

2190
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:50,600
We're good.

2191
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:50,720
Nice.

2192
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,420
You gotta kill guys.

2193
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,460
Oh my god.

2194
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,180
You gotta kill him.

2195
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:55,960
Let's go.

2196
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,760
Yeah, I just wanna see if they're still fighting.

2197
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,760
Alright, there's no one in the diner, bro.

2198
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:01,460
I kinda wanna get...

2199
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,020
Can you guys come to me real quick, actually?

2200
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:03,680
Come here.

2201
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:04,940
Come to the bottom floor.

2202
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:05,360
Come on.

2203
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,100
We're gonna make a crazy play.

2204
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,500
Yeah, come here right now.

2205
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,120
Outside.

2206
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:10,900
We're gonna make a crazy play.

2207
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,120
It doesn't matter anymore.

2208
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,220
Yeah, true.

2209
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,900
Are we just playing on the roof of that?

2210
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:19,680
Is that what we're doing?

2211
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,260
Stay with me.

2212
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:20,540
Stay with me.

2213
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,340
Just in case.

2214
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:23,520
Come here.

2215
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:23,800
Come here.

2216
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,340
We're gonna take this outside.

2217
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:25,800
What did I miss?

2218
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,300
What did I miss?

2219
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,360
You're not.

2220
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:27,540
You're not.

2221
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:27,960
Just play slow.

2222
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,560
I didn't miss, guys.

2223
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,520
Shoot this team up.

2224
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,220
Shoot this team up.

2225
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,760
Shoot this team up.

2226
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:33,260
Come to me.

2227
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:33,600
Come here.

2228
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,040
Yeah, we're good.

2229
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:35,260
We're good.

2230
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,840
This team's not gonna be in for that long.

2231
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:37,420
They're out next round.

2232
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,100
Just play on me.

2233
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:38,980
Let's see where this round's going.

2234
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,740
Wait, I don't know where I'm getting shot from.

2235
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,100
You're getting shot from the top, Teppo.

2236
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:43,520
Just come to me.

2237
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,400
This is safe.

2238
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,320
This is safe.

2239
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,140
Yeah, we're good.

2240
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:46,320
We're good.

2241
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,360
Ooh, I'm so...

2242
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:49,960
There's a team underneath us.

2243
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,580
They don't know we're underneath.

2244
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,160
They don't?

2245
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:53,780
I thought they do.

2246
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:55,680
No, they do.

2247
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,620
They're looking at me.

2248
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,360
They're looking at me right here.

2249
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,660
Oh, that's fine.

2250
01:04:59,660 --> 01:04:59,900
See?

2251
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,860
They definitely know.

2252
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,160
His cheats are triggering through the wall.

2253
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:05,540
Yeah.

2254
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,700
The cheats are triggering.

2255
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,080
Bad him!

2256
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:08,480
Bad him!

2257
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,300
We're streamers.

2258
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,020
We know what we're talking about.

2259
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:11,940
Air grenades.

2260
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:12,320
Air grenades.

2261
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:12,680
Play slow.

2262
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,360
Play low.

2263
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:13,680
Play low.

2264
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:13,900
Play low.

2265
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,180
We're good.

2266
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:14,380
We're good.

2267
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,000
Air frags.

2268
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,420
We're good.

2269
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,600
Where do we go here?

2270
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,900
We're gonna jump down and just fight for the second floor here.

2271
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,400
Okay.

2272
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,920
We're gonna just jump down.

2273
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,480
We're gonna ulti this.

2274
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,060
Ulti the staircase to have a late game, okay?

2275
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:25,760
Whatcha gonna do?

2276
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,760
This one I'm peeing right now in front of me.

2277
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,460
The only one that we have in the zone.

2278
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:31,860
The next one.

2279
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,400
We're gonna ulti that late game.

2280
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,080
We're gonna play for it.

2281
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,480
We should be fine.

2282
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,960
Oh, they're portaling out that team.

2283
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,320
I'm trying to shoot the team on our left.

2284
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:43,800
Yeah, the team on our left shouldn't be a problem.

2285
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,520
Just when they rotate in.

2286
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,140
I don't know what they're doing.

2287
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,000
They're still there.

2288
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,020
They ported out.

2289
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:48,640
They ported out.

2290
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,100
They ported out.

2291
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:49,780
They're gone now.

2292
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,900
This team needs to fucking get fucked though.

2293
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:53,940
I'm so pissed at these guys.

2294
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,060
Wait what?

2295
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:57,920
What's the charge in our retos?

2296
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,240
We should go down to third party this if we can't wait.

2297
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,340
Wait a little bit, wait, there's a trade.

2298
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:03,860
We're gonna jump down.

2299
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,360
Oh, come here.

2300
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,420
Come here.

2301
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:16,880
He's okay.

2302
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,480
Oh, he did not.

2303
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:18,880
Oh, he did not.

2304
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:20,320
It's okay.

2305
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,040
Come here, Donkey.

2306
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:21,340
Come to me.

2307
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:21,560
Come here.

2308
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,440
We have to fight for this.

2309
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,060
We have to fight for this.

2310
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:23,980
We have to fight for this.

2311
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,400
Okay.

2312
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,400
Fuck.

2313
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,600
If you have an evac, just get on the height if you have an evac.

2314
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,720
Oh, I do have an evac.

2315
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2316
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,180
Just come to the front side.

2317
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,040
Just come up to the second floor.

2318
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,320
Don't overthink it.

2319
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:33,680
Just play slow.

2320
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,120
We're good.

2321
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:35,720
Wait, wait.

2322
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,160
Did they finish?

2323
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:36,620
They finished.

2324
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,180
I got a kill.

2325
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:37,800
Suck my dick!

2326
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,400
Nice.

2327
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:38,940
Come here, come here.

2328
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:39,540
Come here, come here.

2329
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,900
Oh, shit!

2330
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:41,920
Come here.

2331
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:42,620
Okay.

2332
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,460
Just put barrels down here and start shooting them.

2333
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,640
They're gonna start shooting us on the bottom side.

2334
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,020
We're good.

2335
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:47,920
They locked their costume.

2336
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,920
They locked their costume?

2337
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:51,360
Nice.

2338
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:51,820
We're good, Debbie.

2339
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,560
I killed their costume.

2340
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,900
There's no one here, right?

2341
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,640
No one here.

2342
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,020
No one here.

2343
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:56,480
They're on the side.

2344
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,240
They're right here now.

2345
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,960
I can scan in two seconds.

2346
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,040
I got a kill.

2347
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,420
We're good.

2348
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:00,660
We're good.

2349
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,260
Oh my god.

2350
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,200
We have two kills now.

2351
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,000
We have three kills.

2352
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,240
I have one too.

2353
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,480
I would say we need to wipe these guys.

2354
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,160
They need to walk out first floor before we need to jump off.

2355
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:09,320
Wait.

2356
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:09,620
Right here.

2357
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:10,300
In the open.

2358
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,000
No!

2359
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,760
That's my... Oh, you fucking...

2360
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,300
Fuck.

2361
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,020
I'm gonna kill.

2362
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:15,720
I'm gonna kill.

2363
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,440
I'm trying to get the thirst for you.

2364
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,400
Nice.

2365
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:18,660
We're good.

2366
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,120
We're good.

2367
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:19,220
Oh yeah.

2368
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,020
We're good.

2369
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,560
Let's go, guys.

2370
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,420
Good shit, dude.

2371
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:23,440
Alright.

2372
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,780
This team needs to jump out to us and let's...

2373
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,760
There's a team right here.

2374
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:26,620
I'm pinging them.

2375
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:26,800
Okay.

2376
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:27,800
They're leaving.

2377
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,380
They're leaving.

2378
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:28,640
They're leaving.

2379
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,480
I'm just scanning.

2380
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,320
They're just scanning it.

2381
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:31,540
We're good.

2382
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:31,740
We're good.

2383
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,100
We're getting this.

2384
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:32,420
We're getting this.

2385
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:32,460
We're going.

2386
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:32,760
We're going.

2387
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,100
Take space.

2388
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:33,420
Take space.

2389
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:33,920
Come with me.

2390
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,200
Come with me.

2391
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:34,580
Oh, that's a wall.

2392
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,340
Oh, you have your ulti, right?

2393
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:35,840
You have your ulti?

2394
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:35,900
Yeah.

2395
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:36,900
No, no.

2396
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:37,140
I don't.

2397
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:37,520
I don't.

2398
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:38,780
I'll tell you what we do.

2399
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,920
Two teams fighting here.

2400
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,460
Yes, I do.

2401
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,860
We're going to ult these kids off.

2402
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:42,640
We're going to ult these kids off right now.

2403
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,020
I'm with nade.

2404
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:44,280
I'm nading.

2405
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:45,260
Yeah.

2406
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,820
Go with our grenades.

2407
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:46,980
One team here.

2408
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:47,920
Yeah.

2409
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,580
But just play with my staircase.

2410
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:48,960
We're good.

2411
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,340
Play near me.

2412
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,720
Tempo, jump down.

2413
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,200
Come right down to me.

2414
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,320
Because you're going to die when you jump off.

2415
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:54,860
I'm safe here.

2416
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,460
Oh, wait.

2417
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:55,720
No, I'm not.

2418
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:55,760
Yeah.

2419
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,820
I'm safe here.

2420
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,460
I'm safe here for now.

2421
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:57,860
Yeah.

2422
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:58,360
Back up with me.

2423
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,000
Got to get some barrels down.

2424
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:00,580
Tempo.

2425
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,040
And try to ulti forward if we need to late game.

2426
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,080
They're right here.

2427
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:03,460
They're right here.

2428
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:04,280
Yeah.

2429
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,260
I have another nade.

2430
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,140
I'm going to scan them, nading.

2431
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,120
Yeah.

2432
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,320
Tempo, throw your ulti on these kids again.

2433
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:10,820
Throw it.

2434
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,080
Throw it.

2435
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:11,320
Throw it.

2436
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,180
Oh, they're not there.

2437
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:15,960
I know.

2438
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,200
I know.

2439
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:16,680
But you need to throw it.

2440
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,280
We saw them on the one side.

2441
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:17,600
The right side.

2442
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:17,880
Over here.

2443
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,400
Somewhere.

2444
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,960
These kids have no angles on the right side.

2445
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:20,720
You need to just pressure them.

2446
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,600
You need to throw this ulti right here.

2447
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,320
In this corner.

2448
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,280
Oh.

2449
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,260
Come on.

2450
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:24,480
That's fine.

2451
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,600
I hit the wall.

2452
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,000
Oh my god.

2453
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:28,040
No.

2454
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:28,320
No.

2455
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,260
There's no fucking way.

2456
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,000
You just hit the wall.

2457
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:31,340
Revival.

2458
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:31,620
Revival.

2459
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:31,740
Revival.

2460
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,860
They're so happy.

2461
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,200
They're so happy.

2462
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:33,200
Okay.

2463
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:33,600
We're good.

2464
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,200
There's no shot.

2465
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,500
They're so happy.

2466
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,060
That guy's a rat.

2467
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:38,460
That's a rat.

2468
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:39,580
That is a rat.

2469
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:39,860
That is a rat.

2470
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:40,600
That's right.

2471
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,820
Keep them barrels forward, Tempo.

2472
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,520
Keep them barrels forward.

2473
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,140
We're good.

2474
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,400
There's a rat right here.

2475
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,020
We want to rush that.

2476
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:45,820
They're crossing us.

2477
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,380
They're crossing us.

2478
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:47,720
Oh.

2479
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,620
I didn't realize that was you.

2480
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,220
They're crossing us.

2481
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,540
Oh my god.

2482
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,660
Tempo, you had fun.

2483
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,340
We just needed to...

2484
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,340
I didn't see the wall.

2485
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,180
I didn't see the wall and I hit it by mistake.

2486
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,080
Tempo, you had a good job.

2487
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,400
Oopsies.

2488
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,520
We were just waiting for Tempo to do his thing.

2489
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,220
Okay, wait.

2490
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:11,540
Wait, wait.

2491
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,560
That's real life, dude.

2492
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:12,980
Wait, wait, wait.

2493
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:13,720
It didn't hit the wall.

2494
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,240
It hit Wig's gigantic head.

2495
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,160
Are you going to play for ITL?

2496
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:22,400
Yo, Wig.

2497
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,440
Your head was in the way.

2498
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,280
Are you fucking kidding me?

2499
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,060
Me!

2500
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,320
Me!

2501
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:30,760
Me!

2502
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,980
Oh my god, dude.

2503
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,140
That was so bad if we had that ulti.

2504
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,000
Bro.

2505
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,380
My heart hurts.

2506
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,780
Great game guys!

2507
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,100
We got third!

2508
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,660
We got so many kills!

2509
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:44,620
We're good.

2510
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,020
We qualify for the next round 100%.

2511
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,420
Good job!

2512
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:47,740
Wait, wait.

2513
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,740
Good job, Tempo!

2514
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,320
Stay alive and take that evac tower.

2515
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:51,700
Good job.

2516
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,300
I was so nervous when you called.

2517
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,300
Good call on the evac.

2518
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,080
Wait, how did you get up there, Doggy?

2519
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,500
It was a Horizon Q.

2520
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,600
I just took the Q.

2521
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,580
Where the fuck did a Horizon Q come from?

2522
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:04,840
I don't know.

2523
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,820
It just showed up.

2524
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,320
I was like, yay!

2525
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,420
I was like, okay, Doggy's with me.

2526
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,000
At least we can wrap around and do something.

2527
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,520
And then I was like, oh, someone came in to kill me.

2528
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,500
And I was like, where did you go?

2529
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,860
I can't believe that Q.

2530
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,500
Change name, change name!

2531
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,420
We gotta...

2532
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,460
We gotta unite!

2533
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,460
It's not gonna let me.

2534
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,380
I'm on EA apps.

2535
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,220
It's gonna be so long.

2536
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,540
Okay guys.

2537
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,440
We're in sixth now.

2538
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,520
We're gonna get sixth.

2539
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,620
After all that, we only got sixth?

2540
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2541
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,680
We're in seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth points-wise.

2542
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,140
We are 14.

2543
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,680
And then the next four are 12, 8, 7, 5.

2544
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,480
Okay, we're good.

2545
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,060
We're so good.

2546
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,160
But!

2547
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:47,760
But!

2548
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:52,140
The teams right above us are only at 15 and 19.

2549
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:52,680
See?

2550
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:53,340
We're vibing.

2551
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,280
But how did we only leave up one place?

2552
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,160
We can end this in second place.

2553
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,140
That's crazy.

2554
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:00,960
Okay, please don't...

2555
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,440
After what happened last game...

2556
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,660
Wait, what am I?

2557
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:06,120
I'm not even gonna watch this.

2558
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,620
I think I could still play Kostic on this.

2559
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:11,520
You could, yeah.

2560
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,540
You might want to be honest.

2561
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,040
Fuck it.

2562
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:14,920
Let's see.

2563
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,320
We're gonna be...

2564
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,100
Where do we wanna go?

2565
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,640
Lightning rod.

2566
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,120
I'm down actually.

2567
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,260
Am I doing the same?

2568
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,280
Am I playing Bloodhound still?

2569
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,320
Yeah, I mean if you want to.

2570
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,080
Are you more comfortable on Bangalore here?

2571
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:31,960
Because Bangalore is pretty good.

2572
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,560
I can do either.

2573
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,580
I can do Bang, yeah.

2574
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,160
Alright, yeah, I'll just play Blood.

2575
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:36,920
We'll see how it goes first game.

2576
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,840
Yeah, yeah, we'll see how it goes.

2577
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,880
We're experimenting now.

2578
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,620
It's a code.

2579
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,100
Oh, code's out.

2580
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:42,980
Alright, code's out.

2581
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,820
Yeah, oh no, we know.

2582
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,460
We're both in here.

2583
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,860
Oh, guys, did you guys know?

2584
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,580
We should've told you.

2585
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,480
Hey guys, the code's out by the way, everybody.

2586
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,720
We totally want you in the game with us.

2587
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,240
Don't worry.

2588
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,340
We would not be the same without you.

2589
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,480
On the globe?

2590
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:01,760
No way.

2591
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,480
That's a code that keeps everybody together.

2592
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:08,680
No way the spotlight on my Twitch dashboard is the new level 10 hype train emote.

2593
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,740
There's no way they're doing that to me right now.

2594
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,320
Wait, really?

2595
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,500
Are you showing the hype train emote they got from Bangalore?

2596
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,440
I literally said spotlight.

2597
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,660
New hype train emote.

2598
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,460
It's level 10.

2599
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,160
I ended up level 10.

2600
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,060
Oh my god.

2601
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,960
You fucking reminded me.

2602
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:26,220
Why not?

2603
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,260
Yes, why not?

2604
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,940
We just wanted you to be sure that you helped contribute to the game.

2605
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,560
I'm gonna help you to success.

2606
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,960
Not your success, but like other people's successes, you know?

2607
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,280
Exactly.

2608
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,980
And that's all that matters.

2609
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:40,940
That's so nice of you.

2610
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,740
I'm actually a good guy.

2611
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,180
Yeah, you're such a good guy.

2612
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:43,920
See?

2613
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,240
Thank you.

2614
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,120
I appreciate that.

2615
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:46,720
See?

2616
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,120
He already has everything he ever wanted.

2617
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,560
So he gives his successes to others.

2618
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:52,780
Wow.

2619
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,700
That's a good way to look at it to be honest.

2620
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,040
Yeah.

2621
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,780
So Turtle Beach.

2622
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,800
I'm cheaper.

2623
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,620
Wait, what?

2624
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:00,980
Hello?

2625
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:03,580
I don't know that nice.

2626
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:07,980
I came back and all I heard was, Turtle Beach, I'm cheaper.

2627
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,760
That's all you need to know.

2628
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:13,960
I'm fucking weak.

2629
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,300
What was that?

2630
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,540
Can we talk about what that Kost was doing?

2631
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,780
The first Kost we killed that was trying to cross in the open with nothing.

2632
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,320
That was so sad.

2633
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,060
I felt bad killing that guy.

2634
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,000
I don't.

2635
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:28,940
I don't.

2636
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,360
I can't lie.

2637
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,020
I did a little bit.

2638
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,560
One more point for me.

2639
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,980
That's all that matters.

2640
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,460
Oh shit.

2641
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,760
You're sponsored by Gillette Labs?

2642
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,660
I am sponsored by Gillette.

2643
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:42,600
Yeah, the best a man can get.

2644
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:43,460
Yeah, Gillette.

2645
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,800
You know when we were at Twitch Rivals?

2646
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,460
Hey guys.

2647
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,380
Yeah.

2648
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,400
They were for... what?

2649
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,080
For our balls dude.

2650
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:00,940
Yeah.

2651
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:01,820
Yeah.

2652
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,000
It was like their own manscaping thing.

2653
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,480
It's a pubic shaver.

2654
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:05,940
Oh.

2655
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,280
Damn.

2656
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,740
I did not use that shit.

2657
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,300
You didn't...

2658
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,220
That's not a good sponsor thing to do.

2659
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,680
You're not using your own products?

2660
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,240
Oh no.

2661
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,680
You gotta trim the jungle down a bit.

2662
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,860
Gillette, did you hear that?

2663
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,140
Wig doesn't even use your product.

2664
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,200
I'm getting shamed for not shaving my balls out.

2665
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,280
That is insane.

2666
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,440
If you believe in the product...

2667
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,320
What doesn't sponsor me to shave my balls dude?

2668
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,040
It's implied.

2669
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,880
It's a facial sponsorship.

2670
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:40,880
It's implied.

2671
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,840
You don't know that.

2672
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,840
What does it say in your contract?

2673
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:44,820
Hair is everywhere.

2674
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,980
Hair is everywhere.

2675
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,420
How do you know that Tempo?

2676
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,500
How do you know he has hair?

2677
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,400
How do you know I got hair everywhere Tempo?

2678
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,760
How do you know that Tempo?

2679
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,360
He has something in the...

2680
01:14:59,360 --> 01:14:59,700
He has something in the...

2681
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,280
I'll see you at LAN.

2682
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,540
I'll see you at LAN.

2683
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,960
After our volleyball game, it's me and Tempo in the showers.

2684
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:06,940
After hours.

2685
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,280
He's definitely looking.

2686
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,380
Gotta give that homie a...

2687
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,220
Gotta give that homie a glance over.

2688
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:14,620
You know?

2689
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,100
Tempo, that's lowkey the only L.

2690
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,080
If I don't move the Texas Brawlers, we can't do our own volleyball league bro.

2691
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,280
It's like lowkey the biggest L.

2692
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,080
Wait, wait, wait.

2693
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:23,840
So you're not?

2694
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,440
No.

2695
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,140
100%.

2696
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,240
I'm actually probably buying a place in LA.

2697
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,160
You're gonna move to LA?

2698
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:30,580
I live in LA.

2699
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,340
Wait, aren't you in LA?

2700
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:32,960
Yeah, I'm trying to buy a place here.

2701
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,660
That's so expensive.

2702
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,140
I put an offer down already actually on a place.

2703
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:37,680
Holy shit.

2704
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,900
That's so expensive.

2705
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,240
How much was it?

2706
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,960
Tempo is now looking for a new roommate.

2707
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,200
How much did you put down?

2708
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,180
How much do you have in your bank account?

2709
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,820
How much is your mortgage?

2710
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,100
What's your social security number?

2711
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,060
What's your mortgage?

2712
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,680
What's your pet name?

2713
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,620
What's the coordinates for it?

2714
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:00,380
What the coordinate ordinance are so like everybody can like look it up.

2715
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,380
Why did you say it like coordinate ordinance?

2716
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:05,120
Coordinate ordinance?

2717
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,400
The co-ordinate ordinance?

2718
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,600
We got the co-ordinate ordinance guys.

2719
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:11,720
Oh god.

2720
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:14,360
Alright, we're going lightning rod.

2721
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,420
If there's anyone there, I don't really know what to say.

2722
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,780
We deviate to Zeus.

2723
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,460
Yeah, probably actually.

2724
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:22,480
Probably.

2725
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,620
I think we're good.

2726
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:25,620
Yeah?

2727
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:26,380
Yeah.

2728
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,360
Alright, we'll see what happens.

2729
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,820
You know you're jump master right?

2730
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:30,680
No, I had no idea.

2731
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,260
Sorry guys.

2732
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,080
There might be a team there actually now because I jumped late.

2733
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:34,860
There might be a team there, yeah.

2734
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,120
There's no way you called it.

2735
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:41,700
There's no way they would contest it.

2736
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,200
Those two teams are fighting at Zeus today.

2737
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,940
Where's the beacon?

2738
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:46,800
They're contesting.

2739
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,940
There's like 13 teams.

2740
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,360
I don't know why you would.

2741
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,800
Unless you really don't like a team.

2742
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,000
I'm just gonna go here.

2743
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,340
There's no beacon at lightning rod.

2744
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,380
I'll land back side.

2745
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,960
Just in case that team decides to come this way.

2746
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,720
After realizing they're being contested.

2747
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,880
I feel like they would realize they're being contested like very early on.

2748
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:14,060
The fact that they still committed to it is actually crazy though.

2749
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:14,680
The fact that they still committed to it is actually crazy though.

2750
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:14,680
Low key.

2751
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,100
Low key.

2752
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,340
I think they saw that too.

2753
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:19,100
I think they saw that too.

2754
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,380
Oh god I have the buster sword on this character.

2755
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,120
I look ridiculous.

2756
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,160
The bonk sword.

2757
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:32,320
I wrote in chat during the whole Karsa thing that guys don't worry you're gonna watch tempo carry.

2758
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:37,760
And then people thought that was the moment where he got that one kill.

2759
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,780
And they're like this is it.

2760
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,840
This is where tempo carries.

2761
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,280
Little do they know.

2762
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,860
What do you mean?

2763
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,980
Wig was in my way.

2764
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:45,540
Wig's drinking.

2765
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,340
I'm finally gonna throw that ulti.

2766
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,180
Oh my god.

2767
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,380
It's off my fat head.

2768
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:54,900
Bucks it up and then blames it on you.

2769
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,140
I think he's really said 7000 times to fucking throw it.

2770
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,380
It's like my timmy incident.

2771
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,900
Alright well this box is straight.

2772
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,040
What a stupid prowler.

2773
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,460
Did you send the box off the mountain?

2774
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,620
Yes that is so dumb.

2775
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,420
Why does that exist?

2776
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:11,980
Nice.

2777
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,060
Wait what do I do here?

2778
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:14,780
This.

2779
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,560
I need a bunch of blue backpacks over here if anyone needs.

2780
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,520
Like tons.

2781
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,360
I have white.

2782
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,080
I'm heading over.

2783
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:25,300
I'm running carbine.

2784
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:27,380
Carbine.

2785
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:28,340
Fowler.

2786
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:30,600
Oh.

2787
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,380
I'll burble barber here if I want to.

2788
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,960
Oh wait actually there's a devotion here.

2789
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,460
I'm about to take this.

2790
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,160
Alright.

2791
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,660
Getting to that backpack.

2792
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,100
It's up top.

2793
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,620
You know where it is?

2794
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:44,940
Right here?

2795
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:45,900
Yeah.

2796
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,820
I'm heading over now.

2797
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,340
I got a havoc.

2798
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,320
Wait did someone loot here?

2799
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,840
I think Doki did right?

2800
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:54,520
Wait what?

2801
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:54,900
No.

2802
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,420
Wait which way?

2803
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:57,540
No.

2804
01:18:58,620 --> 01:18:59,600
I did not loot that.

2805
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:03,800
I looted this.

2806
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,080
Well someone looted that so I'm running away.

2807
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,800
Yeah definitely don't play near that.

2808
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,420
Don't.

2809
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,100
I'm coming back guys don't worry.

2810
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,420
We need to figure out where we're getting a fucking evo.

2811
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,960
An evo and then also people scan.

2812
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,120
I already grabbed us one evo.

2813
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,300
Oh nice okay.

2814
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,720
I'm gonna go get that fucking thing.

2815
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,100
Yeah you're good.

2816
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,800
The cell bin?

2817
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,200
Yeah that thing.

2818
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,300
That thing?

2819
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,960
We're so fucking choked.

2820
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:33,980
What do you mean?

2821
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,620
I called it correctly.

2822
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,940
Oh I got the wrong thingy.

2823
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,260
Oh wait what's your thingy?

2824
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:40,440
No.

2825
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,220
What does that mean?

2826
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,640
You got the wrong upgrade.

2827
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,560
Was it the tactical cooldown or the ultimate tactical?

2828
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,240
Yeah it was tactical.

2829
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,260
I got the eater.

2830
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,420
How did you?

2831
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:51,980
Okay.

2832
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,520
Let's go we're gonna take this cannon.

2833
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,500
I'm ready.

2834
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,160
Oh wait there's a band.

2835
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,800
I'm checking it out.

2836
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,380
There's someone there.

2837
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:06,360
I think we go back maybe and go towards top command.

2838
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:09,260
And go into command and maybe hit the beacon scan.

2839
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,640
But we need to hit a fucking beacon.

2840
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,080
Actually fuck that let's go back to our base.

2841
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:12,300
Let's go towards Zeus.

2842
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,560
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

2843
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,320
Go back towards Zeus and go from there.

2844
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,140
I feel like we were supposed to take the car.

2845
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,320
I should ask Raven what we're supposed to do here.

2846
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,700
Oh we probably should have.

2847
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,840
It's okay it's not a big deal.

2848
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:23,860
Just walk it.

2849
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,060
They just left Zeus so we should be fine.

2850
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:27,980
They did?

2851
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:28,820
Yeah they did.

2852
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,400
So we should be fine on the rotation then.

2853
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,240
Alright we'll hit the circle scan.

2854
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,780
And then we'll come back down and see where we have to go from there.

2855
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,040
We can just go to wall 2 if we need to.

2856
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,480
Yeah that that and then boom.

2857
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,260
I'm gonna craft one battery as well.

2858
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,320
Cause I have only one.

2859
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,220
I'll craft one up.

2860
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,520
I have three bats.

2861
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,520
Tempo go hit that circle scan whenever you can.

2862
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:55,420
Yep.

2863
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,120
You're gonna get the evo right?

2864
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,520
Actually I'll head over to the evo.

2865
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,900
I'll get the evo you're good.

2866
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:02,380
Really?

2867
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,320
You're the bloodhound.

2868
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,600
Should we really let the bloodhound get the evo?

2869
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,820
I'll get scanned if they're getting ratted on this building or some shit.

2870
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:10,760
Yeah that's a good idea.

2871
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,880
That would be pretty funny though.

2872
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:14,940
That would be pretty fucking hilarious.

2873
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,180
If you died that way I would laugh.

2874
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,380
Where are those fucks?

2875
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,340
Oh it's over here.

2876
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,080
Wait do you not know where the ring comes from?

2877
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:23,940
Nope.

2878
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,400
This is unbelievable to me.

2879
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,520
Should we take the redeploy?

2880
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:29,960
Oh.

2881
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,260
Guys wait for me I'm coming back.

2882
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:33,980
We'll wait for you.

2883
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,240
I have not found a charge rifle yet.

2884
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,640
I know what a shame.

2885
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,620
Alright we see that zone.

2886
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,320
We're at the checkpoint for sure.

2887
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,560
Checkpoint slash north pad.

2888
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,400
We're just gonna run down and...

2889
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,900
We should take the balloon.

2890
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:49,440
Alright.

2891
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,000
IGL.

2892
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,840
Take the balloon and I'll go get the evo cache while you guys just land wall.

2893
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:55,340
Okay.

2894
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,760
Land inside wall, play slow, just land together in the building and I'll walk in afterwards.

2895
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:03,860
And then if Tempo and I die then you can survive and live for us.

2896
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:04,640
And then if Tempo and I die then you can survive and live for us.

2897
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,380
I got you guys.

2898
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,500
And we all know how good you are at ratting.

2899
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,420
Oh wait we don't have a people thing.

2900
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,060
We don't have a people thing.

2901
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,740
We do have a bloodhound but we don't have a bloodhound.

2902
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,060
We don't have it right now though sadly.

2903
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,180
Wait rank top 1 has 60 points?

2904
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,420
I can't see if I can see people.

2905
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,480
That did not register for me.

2906
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,640
Wait who has 60 points?

2907
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,640
Rank 1.

2908
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,460
Number 1.

2909
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:27,500
In our lobby.

2910
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,640
They have 60 points.

2911
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,860
Let's stay the fuck away from those guys guys.

2912
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,400
Yeah what the fuck.

2913
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:33,760
I'm good I'm happy.

2914
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,400
Jesus christ.

2915
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:34,920
Are we going here?

2916
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,540
We're waiting for...

2917
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:39,180
You got scanned?

2918
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,040
From inside the ball thingy?

2919
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:41,540
Oh I see them.

2920
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,000
They are across the way.

2921
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:44,860
You can hear me?

2922
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,000
Yeah you are good.

2923
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:46,540
I'm coming to you right now.

2924
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:47,980
I'm gonna get on the roof and shoot for you.

2925
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:48,700
You okay?

2926
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:50,380
I'm alive.

2927
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,160
They should want to fight this guys.

2928
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,500
It's a mad maggie team which is annoying.

2929
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,300
Help me.

2930
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:00,920
Tempo!

2931
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:02,540
Can you get the res?

2932
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:02,940
Can you get the res?

2933
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,400
They are here.

2934
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,860
I don't know if I can grab this.

2935
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:09,980
I'm on first floor.

2936
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,380
Stairs stairs stairs.

2937
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,380
I'm backing to you.

2938
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,780
Yeah I'm trying to run down.

2939
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:17,940
I don't know if you can try.

2940
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,740
I'm gonna run as close as I can to you.

2941
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,200
So you can come grab my banner later.

2942
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:24,060
Tempo!

2943
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,000
I bet you are trolling.

2944
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:28,240
You are actually trolling.

2945
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,700
Tempo what happened?

2946
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,360
I got blasted from their roof.

2947
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,200
What the fuck.

2948
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:35,440
I can't.

2949
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,620
God damn it.

2950
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,080
We are fine.

2951
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:38,380
I'm fine.

2952
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:44,960
You can rat in this corner.

2953
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,300
And then you can loop around.

2954
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,200
And come get our banner.

2955
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:47,540
Easy.

2956
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,800
I'm not ratting for anything.

2957
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:51,320
No no no.

2958
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,560
The far north side.

2959
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,760
I'm dead as fuck.

2960
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:58,240
You can get our banner from the north side.

2961
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:58,920
No way.

2962
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,160
After what he did.

2963
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,340
Do not listen to anything Tempo says.

2964
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,760
I'm dead here regardless I think.

2965
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,120
To be honest.

2966
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,540
These kids are fucking terrible.

2967
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,320
Bro what are you playing with?

2968
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,880
Those kids are fucking horrible.

2969
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,440
You could have nearly crossed by them.

2970
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,480
I mean they are staring at me.

2971
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,220
That's gonna be a problem.

2972
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,000
I think over here.

2973
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,440
Wait the team that killed us is gonna go that way.

2974
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,740
So they can shoot each other.

2975
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:26,260
And then...

2976
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:27,920
You know what I'm saying?

2977
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,380
If you think I'm getting a banner in this situation.

2978
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:31,400
I just want you to let you know.

2979
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,040
There's no way.

2980
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,160
This is the wig show now.

2981
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,400
Get the beep beep.

2982
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,700
This is the wig show.

2983
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,120
I mean if you could send me that would be pretty funny.

2984
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:43,620
It would be pretty funny.

2985
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:46,560
Oh they have a fucking rampart wall just for you by the way.

2986
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,900
No you don't.

2987
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:49,700
Okay I was gonna say.

2988
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,080
We're fine we're fine.

2989
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:51,660
We're good.

2990
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,060
What's the issue?

2991
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,960
They don't see you yet.

2992
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,180
No.

2993
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,860
I'm trying to figure out where I can just route to you.

2994
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,240
I have to go far far right I think.

2995
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,600
Just find a hole.

2996
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,380
For your goal.

2997
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,860
A hole for your goal?

2998
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,780
That sounds crazy.

2999
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,320
What it's true.

3000
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,300
Get in that hole.

3001
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,580
I'm just gonna go over here to the left.

3002
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:22,160
And get in this hole.

3003
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,220
Do you have meds for this?

3004
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:26,240
Okay that's good.

3005
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,040
I'm fine.

3006
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,120
I just don't want this team to see me.

3007
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,140
They'll just kill me in two seconds.

3008
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,360
That would be so fucked though.

3009
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,580
Oh my god scan that.

3010
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:35,660
No.

3011
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,000
Oh yo you can get loot here.

3012
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,120
That would be so funny though.

3013
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,700
And I'm gonna shit my pretty ass right here.

3014
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:48,980
Alright.

3015
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,620
Okay we all know who's fault this is right?

3016
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,560
Yeah yeah yeah.

3017
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,640
Snaky's fault.

3018
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:54,620
Why?

3019
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,380
Actually yeah he was protecting you.

3020
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,980
Yeah I was protecting.

3021
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,840
I was inside the building when he died.

3022
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,620
Like who is he protecting at that point?

3023
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:09,180
I was protecting from the roof and then I ran inside.

3024
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,920
I was literally inside when he was dead.

3025
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,900
My chat's saying to show my apartment on Zillow.

3026
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,280
Laughter.

3027
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,080
Laughter.

3028
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,840
Dude, that's one of the funniest things you ever said.

3029
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:24,860
Coordi-dordi-dance.

3030
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,240
Coordi-dordi-dance.

3031
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:32,280
Shit, Tom, how did you do that?

3032
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,960
I'm surprised you want to live in LA.

3033
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:35,260
It's so fucking expensive.

3034
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,800
Yeah, it is, but like...

3035
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,260
I don't know, I feel like... I was talking to everybody in my family.

3036
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,160
I definitely want to live here forever.

3037
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,180
I'm trying to be like three years in here and then out.

3038
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,240
Like three more years.

3039
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,880
Just like, feel good for business.

3040
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:51,420
And then I'll probably just dip out and probably just buy a house in like San Diego or like Texas or something like that.

3041
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,020
Yeah, oh, so like you're just going for a career.

3042
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,160
It's you and me in LA.

3043
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,360
And then when it's finally...

3044
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,740
When it's finally time to retire...

3045
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,900
You can like...

3046
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:01,660
In three years?

3047
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:02,520
In three years.

3048
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,300
You know when I fall off?

3049
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,920
No, I didn't say that!

3050
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,000
No, no, no.

3051
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,660
I didn't say that!

3052
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,100
I didn't say that!

3053
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:08,220
I said...

3054
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,080
When it's time to retire in three years, you're moving?

3055
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,560
That... it's your choice to leave content creation.

3056
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:15,860
No, no, no.

3057
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,060
Oh my God, please don't do that!

3058
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,180
For the sake of all our viewers, don't do that.

3059
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:23,740
Oh my God.

3060
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:24,720
You don't like it?

3061
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,400
Not a fan.

3062
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,860
Not a fan at all.

3063
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,320
We're fine.

3064
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,620
I can't believe I'm still in here today.

3065
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:33,640
Was it expensive?

3066
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,840
Are you getting a mansion or an apartment?

3067
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,140
No, I'm buying an apartment.

3068
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:37,700
A mansion?

3069
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:38,640
I don't know.

3070
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:38,980
It's LA.

3071
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,120
I don't know what the fuck type of money you think I'm making.

3072
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,320
But like...

3073
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,760
A mansion in LA is like 90 million here.

3074
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,120
Yeah, I'll call content creators and spend all their money on mansions.

3075
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:49,760
And then...

3076
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:54,980
Well, that's funny because they do that with renting and they spend like $20,000 a month renting like a bunch of fucking idiots.

3077
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:55,480
It's so funny.

3078
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,620
Yeah, like us.

3079
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,080
Like us.

3080
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:00,700
I'm trying to be smart with my money.

3081
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:01,500
I'm trying to make it interesting.

3082
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,340
I live for free, so you know.

3083
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,300
You live for free?

3084
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,200
Oh, well...

3085
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:05,720
Good for you.

3086
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,780
Not for long.

3087
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,580
Yeah, I was gonna say...

3088
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,700
Not for long.

3089
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:10,560
I was gonna say...

3090
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:10,600
I was gonna say...

3091
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:10,660
I was gonna say...

3092
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,200
I was gonna say...

3093
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,760
I was gonna say...

3094
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:13,780
You're gonna live for free.

3095
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:14,520
Yeah, you won't planeta left me and left for LA.

3096
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,160
I do watch them.

3097
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,460
Who is that backup plan?

3098
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,240
I actually came on here now.

3099
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,020
Yeah.

3100
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,420
Who is it?

3101
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,160
What was it?

3102
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,220
Who ditched you like that?

3103
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,460
Who would do that to a homey?

3104
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:25,600
Yeah, exactly.

3105
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:30,420
We were about to live together, make food together, sleep together.

3106
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:31,000
Oh!

3107
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:31,640
Yes.

3108
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,220
Especially that last one.

3109
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:33,760
Come on.

3110
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:33,900
Come on.

3111
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:43,740
In the same bed?ưa I thought that's what the homies do I started to...

3112
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:43,740
Yeah.

3113
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,560
Are you still in there?

3114
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,100
Oh, you are.

3115
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,340
He heard us yapping.

3116
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,620
They're in front of me.

3117
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,340
They see your big ass gun poking through the wall.

3118
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:53,900
Yeah, yeah.

3119
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,900
They have your stream up ten minutes later.

3120
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:56,460
This is...

3121
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,660
I mean, lowkey they would have the stream stopped me if they wanted to.

3122
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,820
I've been here for easily ten minutes.

3123
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:04,240
Yeah, I was gonna say this is where you were hanging out for ten minutes.

3124
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,680
This could be an easy top five for the boy though.

3125
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,740
Don't say that!

3126
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:10,800
You're gonna jinx it!

3127
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,720
You're gonna jinx it!

3128
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,420
You're gonna die right here, right now.

3129
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,100
You can get second place.

3130
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,080
We're gonna die right...

3131
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,160
Do you have any nades?

3132
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,080
You can get first.

3133
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,680
I have zero grenades.

3134
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,400
Okay, you can't get first.

3135
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,080
You can get second.

3136
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,680
Okay, I like that idea.

3137
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,580
I'm down for second place.

3138
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,460
If you had nades, you could get first.

3139
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,100
You think so?

3140
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:29,900
Yeah.

3141
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,420
You just arc stick one while they're resing and then you just spitfire them to death and then we win.

3142
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,620
But we have no arcs.

3143
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:37,240
I have a Havoc.

3144
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,420
Oh, that's a Havoc.

3145
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,780
Do you remember what we said about not listening to the...

3146
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:40,920
tempo's cause?

3147
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,740
I didn't know that that's a Havoc.

3148
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,460
That looks like a big ass gun with a spitfire, like a handle thingy.

3149
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,920
It's like it has electricity on it.

3150
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:50,280
It's like it has electricity on it.

3151
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,320
The brown wooden handle thingy.

3152
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,480
I don't think you should like do it now.

3153
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,620
I think you should wait before you start.

3154
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,500
They see a gun poking.

3155
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,760
I think I'm right over here.

3156
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,120
I think I'm in.

3157
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:56,580
Oh no.

3158
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,340
Oh, oh, oh.

3159
01:29:59,160 --> 01:29:59,780
What was that?

3160
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:00,540
What?

3161
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,040
Oh!

3162
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:02,760
They didn't see you.

3163
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:03,860
Stick to the wall.

3164
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:04,460
Stick to the wall.

3165
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:04,980
Stick to it.

3166
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,240
If you don't see them, they don't see you.

3167
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:07,900
Exactly.

3168
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:08,680
That's true.

3169
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,780
Wait, wait, wait.

3170
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:10,780
We saw them though.

3171
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,820
So if you don't move, they don't see you.

3172
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,120
Yeah, yeah.

3173
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,300
Don't move and like...

3174
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,740
They're coming to the stream right now.

3175
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,460
No, they're not.

3176
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3177
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,620
He got his boys, bro.

3178
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:22,220
He got his boys.

3179
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:23,940
He got his boys.

3180
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,600
I hear the water.

3181
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:25,280
I know, I know.

3182
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,260
Yo, they were stream sniping.

3183
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,420
Oh, they definitely are gonna kill you.

3184
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:31,860
Wait!

3185
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:33,820
Oh, run!

3186
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,140
Okay, now they shoot each other.

3187
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:35,480
You're good.

3188
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,780
No, I don't think they're gonna be shooting each other.

3189
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,340
Yeah, they shoot each other here.

3190
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:39,720
No.

3191
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,560
I told you not to jinx this!

3192
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:43,920
I told you guys!

3193
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,440
I just know that they kill like five times, bro.

3194
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,300
I just know that they kill like 30 times.

3195
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:49,900
What the fuck?

3196
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:50,620
I just know that they kill like 30 times.

3197
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:50,620
What the fuck?

3198
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:50,860
Yeah, that's crazy.

3199
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,780
I actually just know that they kill like four times.

3200
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,040
Yeah.

3201
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,460
What the fuck?

3202
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,360
I mean, top six is fine.

3203
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:01,040
I think we're on EU servers.

3204
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:01,900
I think we're on EU servers.

3205
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:02,860
I blame the servers.

3206
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,080
We're literally in East Coast.

3207
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,700
I have 95 ping.

3208
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:07,520
We're in East Coast.

3209
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:07,520
Yeah.

3210
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:08,980
I'm fine too, bro.

3211
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,780
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

3212
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:16,000
Guys, we need a reset here.

3213
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:16,280
Guys, we need a reset here.

3214
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:16,860
We need...

3215
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:18,960
What's top six?

3216
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,600
How many points is that?

3217
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:19,840
Three?

3218
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,100
Three, right?

3219
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,760
I think?

3220
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:23,480
Yeah.

3221
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:24,920
Alright, it's not bad.

3222
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,620
I mean, 17 is not gonna be awful for us.

3223
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,860
We're definitely qualified for sure.

3224
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:28,940
Yeah, we're definitely qualified.

3225
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:32,020
There's no way one team's gonna fucking kick like...

3226
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,040
I do like making the end games, guys.

3227
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,040
Yeah, you know, I do too.

3228
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,860
That seemed really fun.

3229
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,160
Yeah, yeah.

3230
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,320
Yeah, but what about you, bro?

3231
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:40,960
Do you like doing that?

3232
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,080
Yeah, Teppo.

3233
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:42,660
Do you like that?

3234
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,560
Don't worry, guys.

3235
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,260
I got it.

3236
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,960
I blame Doki.

3237
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:48,280
How do you blame me?

3238
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,540
No, I'm down.

3239
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:51,320
I'm so down for that.

3240
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,940
I blame her too, actually.

3241
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
It's two against one.

3242
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:55,620
We can't lose.

3243
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:56,680
It's two against one.

3244
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:57,120
You lose.

3245
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,180
I made it.

3246
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,800
Wait, what happened?

3247
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:03,600
Our pact is over now.

3248
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,480
He's gonna play aggressive.

3249
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,480
Oh, what are they looking at?

3250
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:08,560
They're in duo.

3251
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,440
Why are they playing so aggressive for a duo?

3252
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:11,080
Wait, they're a duo?

3253
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:11,800
Yeah.

3254
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,320
I'm gonna be honest, bro.

3255
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:15,720
If I didn't know right, I think I could've killed him.

3256
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,180
Yeah, but then his duo is gonna kill you.

3257
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,980
No, he would've made it out.

3258
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,240
I would've got a bad off, to be honest.

3259
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,380
That was crazy how bad that lag was.

3260
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,680
All good.

3261
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:28,620
They're gonna get sent on here.

3262
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,320
You know what I should've done?

3263
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,580
I should've not rez tempo and just ran to you.

3264
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:33,580
You know what I should've done?

3265
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:33,580
I should've not rez tempo and just ran to you.

3266
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,080
Honestly, yeah.

3267
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,460
I was thinking about taking that fight, but I know that Zeus station team would've been stacked on loot.

3268
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:42,080
Yeah, I should've left tempo and just ran to the loot.

3269
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:42,420
That's Zeus' team?

3270
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,220
That was the Zeus station team, yeah.

3271
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,720
I don't know why they didn't rotate it farther.

3272
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,760
Oh, what a Valk ulti here.

3273
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:53,920
Oh my god.

3274
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:54,900
Oh my god.

3275
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:56,140
I can't believe he didn't get blasted.

3276
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,580
And the Valk didn't get hit once.

3277
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,060
That's crazy that he lived that.

3278
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,260
Oh my god.

3279
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,260
This team is actually so lucky.

3280
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,100
Where was our luck here?

3281
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,000
Where was our luck here?

3282
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,060
If we did that, you would've died so fast.

3283
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,740
I would've died instantaneously.

3284
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:10,460
Yeah, yeah.

3285
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,740
I would've died in .1 seconds.

3286
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,640
Three teams.

3287
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:19,120
Okay, we're at the point where tempo dies.

3288
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,440
Even my chat was like, No!

3289
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,120
Tempo!

3290
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:22,460
Tempo!

3291
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,300
Wait, let me open this up.

3292
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,780
This guy is tempo.

3293
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,960
Don't worry, you can plug us in.

3294
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,360
I was two minutes ago, tempo!

3295
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:49,780
I'm looking at Greek's face and he's just like, huh?

3296
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,200
My chat's literally saying, Tempo just like me for real.

3297
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:02,360
See, I give the viewers the experience that they would've had had they played Challengers again, okay?

3298
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,220
People are like, tempo's on the roof again.

3299
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,580
I'm giving the viewers what they want.

3300
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,220
Did you guys see what I did in that game?

3301
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,160
I was not on a roof, okay?

3302
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,540
I was on the second floor.

3303
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,820
Wait, was I on the roof?

3304
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:16,360
You literally said you were on the roof and then you dropped down from the roof.

3305
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,580
And you died.

3306
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,000
Oh, I think, no wait.

3307
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,660
Was there a forklift on the roof?

3308
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:24,020
People said you were on the roof.

3309
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,060
My chat was like, tempo versus roof.

3310
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:30,960
Tempo, you need to stop going on the roof!

3311
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:32,140
Tempo, you need to stop going on the roof!

3312
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:34,620
Well, I can't charge rifle if I'm not on the roof.

3313
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,300
Well, we gotta find other ways.

3314
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,100
We gotta find other ways.

3315
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:37,200
We gotta find other ways.

3316
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,120
We gotta figure out another way, tempo!

3317
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,500
You can't keep going on the roof!

3318
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,920
It just means death!

3319
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,220
The roof is a problem for you, buddy.

3320
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,960
Yeah, you're bad from roofs for real now.

3321
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,100
Oh yeah.

3322
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:49,380
Damn.

3323
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,720
We never even got a chance to see if Bangalore is okay.

3324
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:01,030
Come on...

3325
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,410
Okay, we're still in sixth.

3326
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:03,970
We're good.

3327
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:05,930
We're ten points ahead of eleven.

3328
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:06,690
So, you know.

3329
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:08,470
I mean...

3330
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:11,350
I don't know.

3331
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:12,870
No, no, no.

3332
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:14,190
How much for ten points?

3333
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:17,070
Ten points ahead of eleven?

3334
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:17,430
What?

3335
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:18,670
How much for what?

3336
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:20,310
Oh, he muted himself.

3337
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:21,590
Oh, shit.

3338
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:21,910
I muted myself.

3339
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:22,630
What did you just say?

3340
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:22,810
My bad.

3341
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:26,010
You just said how much for what and then you didn't even...

3342
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:27,810
Oh, how many points are we away from tenth right now?

3343
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:28,030
Do you know?

3344
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,190
Oh, nine.

3345
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,610
Oh, we're good.

3346
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:30,890
We're good.

3347
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:35,810
We actually need the most unlucky situation to happen to us to lose.

3348
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:36,170
We actually need the most unlucky situation to happen to us to lose.

3349
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:36,370
Codes up!

3350
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:38,050
Let's go.

3351
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:40,830
I gotta pee so bad now.

3352
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:41,350
I gotta pee.

3353
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:41,850
Go pee!

3354
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:43,310
I gotta urinate so bad.

3355
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:43,530
Yo.

3356
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:49,130
The fuck, man?

3357
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:51,590
What the fuck, man?

3358
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:04,780
It's okay.

3359
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,780
I switched the fuse.

3360
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:07,140
We're good.

3361
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,800
Alright, this is it.

3362
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,000
Wait, are we... we're in Stormpoint.

3363
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:12,260
Yeah, yeah.

3364
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,180
Wait, what were you before?

3365
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:14,760
Caustic.

3366
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:16,980
He's moving too slow.

3367
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:18,860
He's moving too slow.

3368
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:20,860
I'm in drag.

3369
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:21,400
This is it.

3370
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,140
Now that you're on fuse, everything's gonna change, right?

3371
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:24,960
Now we're back.

3372
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,180
No more roofs.

3373
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,720
No more roofs for me.

3374
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,460
I'm a smaller roof character.

3375
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,040
No more roofs, Tempo.

3376
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,240
You stay on the second or first floor.

3377
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,580
Or sometimes maybe the third floor.

3378
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,040
But never on the roof.

3379
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,340
Never on a roof.

3380
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:42,960
This is it.

3381
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,300
This time we're gonna get like...

3382
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,500
We're gonna get second place.

3383
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,700
Because you're not gonna be on the roof.

3384
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,100
No, we're gonna get first place.

3385
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,020
Wait, does first place have like...

3386
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:56,240
Oh, first place almost... is at like 80...

3387
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,200
Is at 80 points.

3388
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:57,840
Jesus.

3389
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,700
Bro, we're not gonna...

3390
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:00,940
We're not even first.

3391
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:01,980
There's no point.

3392
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:02,520
Wait, wait, wait.

3393
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:03,500
We can still get...

3394
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,800
We can still get... top...

3395
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,940
We can get top three.

3396
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:08,680
Yeah.

3397
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:09,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3398
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:13,880
Jesus Christ, the distribution is actually crazy.

3399
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,820
The distribution between the top...

3400
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:19,540
the top ten.

3401
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,180
Wait, where did Wig go?

3402
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:21,980
He has to join us.

3403
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,740
He has to pee.

3404
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:23,820
No, he's in the lobby.

3405
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,180
He's just not moved yet.

3406
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,140
Look, it's Wig's time to pee.

3407
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,360
It's his turn to pee.

3408
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,600
We've always seen...

3409
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:36,920
Yeah, wait a minute.

3410
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,320
I get a little chance to pee here too.

3411
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:39,820
No, I didn't judge.

3412
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,500
I was defending you.

3413
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,500
Oh, yeah?

3414
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,080
Yeah.

3415
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:45,000
Chop, chop.

3416
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,300
Yeah, I fucking defended you.

3417
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,740
I was like, we all had a chance to pee.

3418
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:51,260
But you...

3419
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:51,460
Wait, wait, wait.

3420
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:54,380
Did we die next round last time?

3421
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,200
What?

3422
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,260
Did we die next round last time?

3423
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,640
What do you mean next round?

3424
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,780
No, we made it past round two.

3425
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:01,680
We lost round three, didn't we?

3426
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,160
I don't remember.

3427
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,600
I think we lost round three.

3428
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:06,180
What?

3429
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:06,440
For sure.

3430
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,300
We lost round three last week.

3431
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:09,900
No, we lost round two.

3432
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,620
What do you mean?

3433
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:11,880
Did we really?

3434
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:13,180
Okay, okay, okay.

3435
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:14,980
So we gotta make it past.

3436
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,620
We gotta make it past today then.

3437
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,460
Yes, we have to.

3438
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:20,200
Yes, don't you remember round two?

3439
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,880
We fucking... you guys actually...

3440
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,480
I don't remember anything.

3441
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:25,140
My brain...

3442
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:28,840
You guys had trauma and like fucking forgot about that.

3443
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,600
Oh, our brain has no memory.

3444
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:34,360
I mean, I think I was just hitting straight copium and then we made it to round three.

3445
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:35,640
I was like...

3446
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,560
We died like twice in a row.

3447
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,180
Like before top ten.

3448
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:42,400
We can totally get top three.

3449
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,420
We can totally drop three.

3450
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,180
And then we got like left... we got like fucking dropped out of round two.

3451
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:50,040
Yeah, we got fucked up, huh?

3452
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,220
We got fucked so hard.

3453
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,180
We cannot beat those guys 3v3.

3454
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,220
110 minute delay.

3455
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:59,380
We could barely beat that guy like 1v3.

3456
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:00,560
We could barely beat that guy like 1v3.

3457
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,340
Yeah, no, I actually think we lose 1v3 to those guys.

3458
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:03,340
To who?

3459
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:04,700
The boys.

3460
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:05,080
The boys.

3461
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,200
Fuck no, we win 1v3.

3462
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,300
Tempo, every time you say...

3463
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,920
Remember our rat jam plan?

3464
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:11,800
Yes, we...

3465
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,360
Remember our surprise and then confusion is super effective?

3466
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:14,580
Oh, I remember that.

3467
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,740
Did we confuse them?

3468
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,400
We did not.

3469
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:18,900
We fucking got knocked out.

3470
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:22,020
When we run into them again this time, we'll do that.

3471
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:23,720
We'll use confusion.

3472
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:27,940
We'll kill one, use confusion, kill two, and then 3v1 the last guy.

3473
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,000
We'll use confusion.

3474
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,700
Okay, Tempo.

3475
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:34,860
Tempo, I think you're like on some hardcore copium shit every time.

3476
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:35,060
Okay, Tempo.

3477
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:42,960
I don't know how you do this, but every time, every time, anything comes out of your mouth is some hardcore cope right there.

3478
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,080
You know when you're a delulu?

3479
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,600
Yeah, yeah.

3480
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,400
Last week, Tempo was like, we're gonna make it to the finals, guys.

3481
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,020
We're gonna do it.

3482
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,860
We needed one week of practice.

3483
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:57,160
We needed one week of practice.

3484
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,000
That was our last week.

3485
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,580
Now we're in the finals.

3486
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,340
I can't believe you thought my Havoc was a Spitfire.

3487
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,500
Okay, look.

3488
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:04,320
That guy...

3489
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,320
I'm looking at your stream right now.

3490
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,040
That gun is like a big gun, and you know the little knobby thingy?

3491
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:12,480
The Spitfire has a knobby thingy.

3492
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:14,880
The brown wooden knob thing on your thingy.

3493
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,500
It's literally electricity fucking charging up in his face.

3494
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,420
Yo, that could be a Spitfire skin.

3495
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:20,760
Yo, that could be a Spitfire skin.

3496
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,200
That's energy.

3497
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:21,640
That's energy.

3498
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,840
Spitfire has a blue-like skin that has the thingamajig.

3499
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,880
Spitfire doesn't have the electricity charging out of the gun.

3500
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:29,960
Spitfire doesn't have the electricity charging out of the gun.

3501
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,920
Yo, that giant knobby thingy threw me off, okay?

3502
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:36,140
Look at that knobby thingy.

3503
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,900
The Spitfire has a knob.

3504
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,880
And that thing just has a big-ass knob.

3505
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,380
Why does Havoc have that?

3506
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:44,000
Because it's a skin.

3507
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,420
It's a skin.

3508
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:46,800
It's a skin.

3509
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,160
Exactly.

3510
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,800
Yeah, but you're mad cute, bro.

3511
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:50,140
I love you.

3512
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,360
That's why...

3513
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,960
He doesn't do well with cops on his...

3514
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,880
I can't move.

3515
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,820
That guy was lost in hell.

3516
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,580
Uh-oh.

3517
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:04,120
He said he's broken.

3518
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:06,380
He's like, wait, what?

3519
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,800
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

3520
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,100
Yo, he's like super flustered right now.

3521
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:11,880
Like, oh my god.

3522
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,200
He's a fan.

3523
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,840
He's just like, oh my god, did you say that?

3524
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,440
Did you just compliment me?

3525
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:20,780
Don't forget, no Valk.

3526
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,420
So we need to get those evac towers.

3527
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,620
I thought you were on Fuse.

3528
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:24,580
Why are you on Caustic again?

3529
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,140
We need to...

3530
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:30,740
I rigged it so that we get a map thingy.

3531
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,500
Ah, okay.

3532
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:34,160
I did not rig it enough.

3533
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,340
We didn't get a map thingy.

3534
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:41,520
Do we want to fight some of the punks for this car right here?

3535
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,160
Oh, we're not making this.

3536
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,700
Wait, wait, you gave me jump...

3537
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,620
Don't worry, guys.

3538
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,320
No, no, no, please, for the love of god.

3539
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:51,360
We're gonna go to this cannon.

3540
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,680
You do not make this jump.

3541
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,040
Don't worry.

3542
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,680
Go do it.

3543
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,040
Just do it.

3544
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,460
I will give you literally $10 at the next van.

3545
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,960
I will buy you food if you can make this jump.

3546
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:03,700
Okay, how far do I have to make it?

3547
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,720
All the way to Lightning Rod.

3548
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:07,300
What about Thunder Watch?

3549
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:08,160
Nope, Lightning Rod.

3550
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,920
Alright, let me go get Evan.

3551
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:11,260
One sec.

3552
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,800
Let me go get Evan.

3553
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:16,860
Wait, you're off to a good start right now.

3554
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:17,220
Wait a minute.

3555
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,320
Evan's controlling the mouse right now.

3556
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:20,780
He's muted.

3557
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:22,080
Wait a minute.

3558
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:23,800
This is too good.

3559
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,040
I have to buy you food?

3560
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:25,600
This is crazy.

3561
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,280
I did not expect this out of you, kid.

3562
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:28,780
I'm gonna be honest.

3563
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,600
Wait, Tim is not talking.

3564
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:31,540
He's not talking.

3565
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,420
You guys have to split off.

3566
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,600
I gotta go loot Thunder Watch while you guys go Lightning Rod.

3567
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:37,740
Okay, Tempo.

3568
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:38,640
Oh, that's right.

3569
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,440
Master jump master.

3570
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:41,680
I get free food now.

3571
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:42,780
Yeah, you do.

3572
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:43,920
I'll buy you one meal of land.

3573
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:44,220
Deal.

3574
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:47,800
Okay, clearly we know what's Tempo's motivation now.

3575
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:49,380
Okay, Tempo.

3576
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:57,120
Tempo, if we make it to top five in this game and you stay out of the roofs, we will buy you two lunches.

3577
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,980
Wait, what if...

3578
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,680
There's someone else in the room that makes a lot of money.

3579
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:02,340
I don't know.

3580
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:03,820
You're doing.

3581
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,620
That is crazy.

3582
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:07,860
I'm down though.

3583
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,080
Two lunches to make top five, please.

3584
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:09,600
Yeah, yeah.

3585
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:13,840
What if we make top five and I stay on the roof?

3586
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,800
No, no, no, no, no.

3587
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,060
You have to not be on the roof for this.

3588
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,020
I'm gonna be honest, bro.

3589
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:19,740
I'm gonna be honest.

3590
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,920
If someone finds a digi...

3591
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:25,800
Yeah, yeah, I got you.

3592
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:26,960
Are you running a motion?

3593
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:28,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3594
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,100
There's another redeploy here.

3595
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:31,560
There's a lot of redeploys this time.

3596
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,040
Yeah, just take them if we need.

3597
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,480
Honestly, if we don't have them.

3598
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:35,600
I'll probably take that one.

3599
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:38,540
I need a backpack.

3600
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,460
There's another...

3601
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,580
Sorry, alt-excel here.

3602
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:43,640
Okay.

3603
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,880
I need a backpack too.

3604
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:46,760
Four!

3605
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,500
I have no fucking backpack!

3606
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:52,860
Blue.

3607
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,440
Oh, I have a backpack now.

3608
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:56,560
My backpack.

3609
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,040
It fell off the map again, dude!

3610
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,900
What is the point of these drops?

3611
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:03,480
Genuinely!

3612
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,320
They just fly off the map!

3613
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:07,640
Why me, god?

3614
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,280
Why me?

3615
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,420
You said that the last time the compound on the left was looted?

3616
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:15,580
Yeah, last time.

3617
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:16,920
Yeah, I don't know who's looting that.

3618
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,720
Let's get by survey beacon right here.

3619
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:21,120
Yeah, just pay attention and make sure they don't get sent to us.

3620
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:22,240
Make sure they don't jump on us, yeah.

3621
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,200
Yeah, I don't think they will.

3622
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,300
I'm gonna go loot this and see what happens to me over here.

3623
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:25,680
One sec.

3624
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:26,620
Yeah.

3625
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,500
It's not like you're on an immobile character.

3626
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:31,700
No, you saw my movement last game.

3627
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:32,320
I kind of got that.

3628
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:32,880
Yeah, I saw your movement.

3629
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:33,340
Yeah.

3630
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:35,900
You got shot there for no reason though, but...

3631
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:37,080
Yeah.

3632
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,740
I'm gonna get the car too, I think, for this.

3633
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,860
Is there any beacons we can hit?

3634
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:43,960
Is the car still there?

3635
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,680
Yeah, it is.

3636
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:45,640
Oh.

3637
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,520
I don't think last game anyone looted this properly, because there's no...

3638
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:49,640
Oh, sorry.

3639
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:49,980
I forgot.

3640
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,440
I smoked accidentally.

3641
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:55,020
The pills were 100% open when I checked there last time.

3642
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,600
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck they're doing there.

3643
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:59,460
Grab that evil cash and the car and yadda yadda yadda.

3644
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,100
Yeah, 100%.

3645
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,780
We'll go to zoo station again and hit the beacon again.

3646
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,400
Should be a little easier with the try down here.

3647
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,400
I looted stuff.

3648
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:09,600
I'm a bit low on the resource department.

3649
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,820
There's a blue backpack here, but if you can still come back and get it.

3650
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,360
I might go back and get it.

3651
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:15,740
I'm not sure.

3652
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:16,060
We'll see.

3653
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,320
Where are we going, Wig?

3654
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,120
We're gonna go get the stride in for us and then we're gonna go towards zoo station to hit the beacon.

3655
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:23,520
Alright.

3656
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,000
I'm heading over to...

3657
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,740
Alright, sounds good.

3658
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,440
I'll come pick you up.

3659
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,020
We're vibing.

3660
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:30,220
Just trying to find other loot.

3661
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:32,280
My loot's not really fantastic either, if I'm being honest.

3662
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:38,260
Yeah, I'm wanting hemlock and... well, I'm gonna see if I can find a 30-30 later.

3663
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,380
I definitely don't need this much sniper ammo, but I wanna keep it.

3664
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,720
Wait, does someone want...

3665
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:45,240
I already have it.

3666
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,660
Alright, I'm not bringing a mobi.

3667
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:48,680
I'm gonna take a redeploy.

3668
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:50,800
I think we don't need it yet.

3669
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,940
I feel like if we die, everyone's dead.

3670
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:54,860
I agree.

3671
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,460
Alright, let's take this stride and let's head over.

3672
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,120
I don't know why...

3673
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:58,860
Wait, why are we still...

3674
01:45:58,860 --> 01:45:59,100
Why?

3675
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,800
Because we didn't find the evil cache.

3676
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:03,580
Wait, wait.

3677
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:04,100
I found one.

3678
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:05,680
Oh, nope.

3679
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,820
Oh wait, yeah, we only have one.

3680
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:08,680
That's it.

3681
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:11,640
I didn't get a chance to find a bin to open and assault bin.

3682
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,180
Don't get out of the car yet, because I don't know if they're gonna still be here or not.

3683
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,820
Oh wait, there was an assault bin right here.

3684
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:16,980
Do you wanna get it?

3685
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:17,740
Yeah, let's get it.

3686
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:18,300
We can grab blue.

3687
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,440
Why not?

3688
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,700
Yeah, I swear if you drove it...

3689
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:21,980
Hahaha!

3690
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,380
I don't know.

3691
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,580
I don't know why would you jump out on the bridge, Tempo.

3692
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:26,800
Did he jump out?

3693
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,760
That was so dangerous.

3694
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:30,080
That was scary.

3695
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:32,660
Well, if my car shoots you up, so you can't really die anyway.

3696
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,720
Yeah, but he jumped off in the edge of the...

3697
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:36,980
We were at the edge.

3698
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,140
Wait, wait, oh my god, there's a...

3699
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,160
What?

3700
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:41,640
Golden sniper.

3701
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:43,680
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't get it, buddy.

3702
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:44,180
Yeah, it's all you.

3703
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:44,840
Yeah.

3704
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:48,580
Not golden sniper, but the golden sniper... threat.

3705
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,300
Nope.

3706
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:50,840
Scope.

3707
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:51,980
Sniper threat!

3708
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,280
Yeah, and then it said sniper threat.

3709
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,120
Oh yeah, true, sniper threat.

3710
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:56,660
I don't think I've ever heard anyone call it that, though.

3711
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,400
Was there a re up here?

3712
01:46:59,000 --> 01:46:59,400
Nope.

3713
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:01,200
Oh no wait, I have a re.

3714
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,460
It's almost like prediction.

3715
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,380
Tempo's gonna forget and go to the roof.

3716
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:05,760
Hahaha!

3717
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:08,140
Hahaha!

3718
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:14,640
Hey, if there are no roofs for me to go on, then I can't go on a roof.

3719
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,040
We're in the car.

3720
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,100
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3721
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,040
We're in the car.

3722
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:18,200
Beep beep.

3723
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,160
Alrighty.

3724
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:20,860
Beep beep.

3725
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:22,720
I feel like we're so gonna get shot.

3726
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:24,240
Nah, there's no way.

3727
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,540
If they're still here, they're playing the game entirely wrong.

3728
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,240
Okay.

3729
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:32,040
Cause like, we're playing the game semi wrong right now, and we're pretty early.

3730
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,440
Alright, Tempo, go hit this shit.

3731
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,860
Wait, why did all... why should all of us be here?

3732
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,540
I mean, I just picked Tempo back up, we just go.

3733
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,740
I thought you guys were gonna go craft a bat.

3734
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:48,780
Yeah, I thought, I'm gonna go hit that... I'm gonna hit that beacon... uh, not assault bin.

3735
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:49,400
Assault, yeah.

3736
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,740
Yeah, say beacon.

3737
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:54,640
I'm gonna cut off the battery right now.

3738
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:55,960
Uh...

3739
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:58,800
I'm heading over.

3740
01:47:59,300 --> 01:47:59,940
Yeah, you're good.

3741
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:00,480
Do your thing.

3742
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3743
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,660
I have one on myself.

3744
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:04,740
Did you die here?

3745
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:04,800
Ooh.

3746
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:07,660
That's pretty fire, actually.

3747
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:09,460
I'm gonna use my mid-pitch.

3748
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,300
Oh, look at the zone here, too.

3749
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,460
That's gonna pull to the Braum or shot slash cheetah, I think.

3750
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:18,720
We're gonna go into... we're gonna go get that Evo near wall, and then we're gonna go into command and hit the beacon again.

3751
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:19,560
All right.

3752
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,380
Making another bat.

3753
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:23,400
There you go, dude.

3754
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,260
Yo, my Uber is just disappearing on me.

3755
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,280
All right, here, I'm ready.

3756
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:27,240
Let's go.

3757
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,200
Wee!

3758
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:28,940
All right, we're gonna go into command.

3759
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:29,920
We're gonna go in the command cell.

3760
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:31,660
Actually... yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that?

3761
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:33,440
Command, hit beacon.

3762
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:35,540
What the... what the fuck was that?

3763
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:38,440
Um, um, um, wait, you're driving is a little...

3764
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,820
Is our driver, uh, drunk?

3765
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:44,760
Yeah, we have a... uh, we have a driver that might not know what he's doing.

3766
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:45,380
Doing?

3767
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:45,460
At all?

3768
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,840
Wait, I thought we were gonna... I thought we were gonna scan the people beacon here.

3769
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:48,780
No, no, no.

3770
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,440
Let's move forward.

3771
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:49,920
Okay.

3772
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:51,600
Let's go hit the... let's go hit the fucking scan inside.

3773
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:53,220
I'm gonna grab some syringes from these guys.

3774
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:54,160
Yeah, do your thing.

3775
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:54,680
You're good.

3776
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,140
We're gonna hit the scan down below.

3777
01:48:57,340 --> 01:48:58,720
The... the... the circle scan.

3778
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,000
Then we're gonna go to waterfall and hit the people scan.

3779
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:00,480
Okay.

3780
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,260
We're gonna wait for Dougie, right?

3781
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,200
Yeah, you're good.

3782
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:03,440
I'm here.

3783
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:03,780
I'm here.

3784
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,260
Don't worry.

3785
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,320
Don't worry about me.

3786
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,480
You better... you better... you better...

3787
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,400
All right, if I die, I die.

3788
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,280
Yeah, don't worry.

3789
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:11,040
I believe in you.

3790
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:11,600
We're good.

3791
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:12,080
We're good.

3792
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:13,740
We're... we're chillin', guys.

3793
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:15,240
I have so... that's why I'm behind you guys.

3794
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,320
So if you guys die, I can just leave.

3795
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:17,540
Run away?

3796
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:18,220
Yeah.

3797
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,940
Just not be dead with us.

3798
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:21,740
Like, let's keep up with that.

3799
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:22,000
Yeah.

3800
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,300
Yeah.

3801
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:24,260
I heard something.

3802
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:25,200
Like a boom.

3803
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:26,380
Yeah, we're fine.

3804
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:27,940
I think that's just the ambience.

3805
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:28,960
I think... I think we're okay.

3806
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:29,500
Yeah.

3807
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,140
Oh, get the ring scan.

3808
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:31,780
Get the ring scan.

3809
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:32,800
Yes, sir.

3810
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,960
Get that shit.

3811
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:36,520
We're good to go.

3812
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:37,140
Let's see what goes on.

3813
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,040
And we're gonna go towards...

3814
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,200
Let's see.

3815
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:41,840
First...

3816
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,120
Ooh, that's a really good knowledge for us to have.

3817
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:45,320
Okay.

3818
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:46,340
We're gonna go get...

3819
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:47,300
We're gonna go out this...

3820
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,360
Let's go to this left side over here.

3821
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:48,660
Okay.

3822
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:50,240
We're gonna go get the people scan, then we're gonna go.

3823
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,020
We're gonna go right to zone.

3824
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:51,640
Right behind you?

3825
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:52,980
Yeah, we're good.

3826
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:53,440
All right.

3827
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:54,360
We're playing this right, guys.

3828
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,060
This is the way we should play it in the actual game, too.

3829
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:56,900
Oh my god.

3830
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:58,460
I can't believe we're actually doing it.

3831
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,820
We're learning from our mistakes.

3832
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,080
Yeah, we're slowly but surely learning.

3833
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:02,340
Yeah.

3834
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,820
It's like if we actually did Scribbs, we might have...

3835
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:06,800
No, actually, though.

3836
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,260
We could have... guys, I don't know.

3837
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:10,820
We could have actually done something with our lives, guys.

3838
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,400
I feel like if we actually sort of practiced for this, we could have, you know, made it pretty far.

3839
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:14,840
We could have went pro.

3840
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:15,400
Yeah.

3841
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:15,540
Yeah.

3842
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,060
Hey, we're past first round, guys.

3843
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:18,600
It's all that matters.

3844
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,160
Yeah, yeah.

3845
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,300
We're past first round.

3846
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:22,560
We didn't do worse than we did last week, which is right.

3847
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,340
Should I grab the thing?

3848
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:23,760
I'm gonna have to scan.

3849
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:24,440
Why?

3850
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:24,840
What thing?

3851
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:25,480
You have a cash?

3852
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:25,940
Yeah, go for it.

3853
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:26,320
Yeah, 100%.

3854
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,080
Well, I mean, if we place below top five...

3855
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:31,700
Oh, okay.

3856
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:32,080
I know where to go.

3857
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:33,820
Let's keep... let's go into zone when you guys are ready.

3858
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:34,580
No one knows.

3859
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:35,620
No one knows right now.

3860
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:36,400
Yeah.

3861
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:36,940
Cut to me.

3862
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:37,200
Cut to me.

3863
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,720
Yeah, we have three Rita ploys, too, by the way.

3864
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:40,460
That's fine.

3865
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,060
Just come to me.

3866
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:41,560
We're gonna beat them.

3867
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:42,820
We should at least.

3868
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:42,980
We'll see.

3869
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:45,060
We have three Rita ploys.

3870
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,240
Just follow me.

3871
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:46,620
Yeah, yeah.

3872
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:46,980
Just follow me.

3873
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,300
We're gonna go right into the house inside Jurassic.

3874
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:53,330
Just keep on moving.

3875
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:54,290
Keep on moving.

3876
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:59,250
All I'm gonna say is that if we place below top five, we actually did worse than last week.

3877
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:00,170
I agree.

3878
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:02,630
I fully agree.

3879
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:05,590
With 13 teams instead of 15.

3880
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:08,270
Wait, we're better in harder lobbies.

3881
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:09,190
It just shows how good we are.

3882
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:09,990
All right.

3883
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:10,570
Let's go move it up.

3884
01:51:11,190 --> 01:51:13,470
I'm gonna walk up and we're gonna try to get into this building left side, okay?

3885
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:14,470
Okay.

3886
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:16,850
The building's pretty shit, but we can definitely play it if we need to.

3887
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:17,170
We're scanning.

3888
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:18,370
All right.

3889
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:18,590
We're good.

3890
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:19,030
Take the building.

3891
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:19,490
We're good.

3892
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,030
Okay.

3893
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,670
There's only certain angles we can play in here though.

3894
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:23,450
So we just gotta play smart.

3895
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:24,190
Note to self.

3896
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:25,170
Don't roof.

3897
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:25,710
Don't go on roof.

3898
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:26,610
No, no.

3899
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:29,730
This is like somewhere where you can get absolutely annihilated if you're positioned badly.

3900
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:31,710
What if I take that Evo cache?

3901
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:32,390
Sure.

3902
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:33,050
Go for it.

3903
01:51:33,130 --> 01:51:33,690
I'm gonna do it.

3904
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:34,470
I'm gonna do it.

3905
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:34,810
Go for it.

3906
01:51:34,910 --> 01:51:35,430
You're gonna do it.

3907
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:35,810
You're gonna do it.

3908
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:36,390
I'm gonna do it.

3909
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:37,010
How much do you wanna bet?

3910
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:38,430
You're gonna.

3911
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:38,710
You're gonna.

3912
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:39,030
It's free.

3913
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:40,670
How much do you wanna bet?

3914
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:41,210
I can get it.

3915
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:42,310
Why are we betting money?

3916
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:42,830
Why are we betting money?

3917
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:43,170
We're on the same team.

3918
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:44,270
We're on the same team, guys.

3919
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:44,890
We're on the same team.

3920
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:47,510
I like a little excitement in it.

3921
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:49,230
A little gamble?

3922
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:50,370
A little gamble?

3923
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,270
Oh, yo.

3924
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:52,250
I'm ready to get rich.

3925
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:52,530
Yeah.

3926
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:53,150
Shoot these guys off.

3927
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:55,470
I'm gonna try to at least.

3928
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:57,830
Oh my god.

3929
01:51:57,870 --> 01:51:58,250
They're red.

3930
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:00,350
Our safe space is the staircase by the way.

3931
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:00,690
Okay.

3932
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:02,970
They're on the bottom.

3933
01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:05,670
That team is red by the way.

3934
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:06,150
That's fine.

3935
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:06,850
What the fuck?

3936
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:11,030
Why are they red?

3937
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:13,050
They're so scared of you right now.

3938
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:13,350
Let's go.

3939
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:14,870
He's red.

3940
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,610
I'm gonna eat this 4-10 charge rifle.

3941
01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:18,410
Domnaesh.

3942
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:20,070
You're welcome by the way.

3943
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:21,090
That was my opening.

3944
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:23,290
Oh, I have to reload.

3945
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:23,710
That sucks.

3946
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:26,510
There's a sniper ammo right here if you need it.

3947
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:27,530
They might be like, oh.

3948
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:31,330
They might be like, yo, that's a charge level and a fucking Lomba.

3949
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:32,650
That's definitely minus tempo in team.

3950
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:33,390
We're gonna fight this much.

3951
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:35,750
That's so far right.

3952
01:52:36,170 --> 01:52:37,090
Yo, stop moving.

3953
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:38,430
I would fight them immediately.

3954
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:40,990
For round two, are we all changing our full names?

3955
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:42,250
I'm down if you want to.

3956
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:42,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3957
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:43,450
Okay, okay, okay.

3958
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:44,430
I got a name.

3959
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:45,190
I got a name already.

3960
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:47,010
What are you gonna name yourself?

3961
01:52:47,650 --> 01:52:48,130
Don't worry.

3962
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:48,810
It'll be a secret.

3963
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:50,410
We can't say it out loud.

3964
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:51,510
Oh, true, true, true.

3965
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:52,290
Cause what's the point of saying?

3966
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:54,330
Well, no, it's gonna be on screen anyway.

3967
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:55,370
They're gonna know in 10 minutes.

3968
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:58,490
I mean, they'll know after the first game, you know?

3969
01:52:58,610 --> 01:52:58,890
True.

3970
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:02,030
They won't know until after the first game.

3971
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:02,930
One, two, three, four.

3972
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,070
One more here.

3973
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:08,110
We're in such a good spot right now, by the way.

3974
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,850
Are we?

3975
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:09,630
I can't tell.

3976
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:10,150
Where is everyone?

3977
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:11,650
There's a team behind us.

3978
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:12,790
They're gonna be all on the outside of Jurassic.

3979
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:14,330
There's not many spots to play in Jurassic Park.

3980
01:53:14,370 --> 01:53:14,730
Push for this.

3981
01:53:15,190 --> 01:53:15,870
I'm looking.

3982
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:17,490
I'm looking for us right now.

3983
01:53:17,610 --> 01:53:18,170
Watch it, Kraber.

3984
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:19,310
Kraber on the front side.

3985
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:20,390
Oh, that's not good.

3986
01:53:20,490 --> 01:53:23,110
Oh, you wanna play Kraber versus Charge Rifle Kraber?

3987
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,870
No, we don't.

3988
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:24,630
You don't wanna do that.

3989
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:25,130
We do not.

3990
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,250
We do not.

3991
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:28,530
Oh, you wanna...

3992
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:29,610
Who will win?

3993
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:31,790
A Charge Rifle or a Kraber?

3994
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:33,350
A Charge Rifle is a Kraber.

3995
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:37,830
Respectfully to Tempo, Charge Rifle would not beat that, even if she's the best Charge Rifle player in the world.

3996
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:41,910
You're kind of fucking...

3997
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:43,150
Where is that?

3998
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:46,830
Yeah, you wanna go toe-to-toe with me?

3999
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:48,070
It's like, God damn right I do.

4000
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:48,810
What's fucking...

4001
01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:50,650
You guys got a Charge Rifle.

4002
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:53,010
Wait, why you guys are up... why you guys are down here?

4003
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:54,050
I'll make a mistake, maybe.

4004
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:55,010
It's like, play there.

4005
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,270
You're gonna get a steak?

4006
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:57,430
No, I'm gonna make a mistake.

4007
01:53:57,630 --> 01:53:58,330
He's gonna make a mistake.

4008
01:53:58,490 --> 01:53:59,470
He's gonna do something wrong.

4009
01:54:00,370 --> 01:54:00,650
Potentially.

4010
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:01,730
What is he doing?

4011
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:02,570
Is that a person or...?

4012
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:03,770
They're fighting over in Pile of Lines.

4013
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:05,610
I'm trying to see if I get picked, but I don't think they're fighting anymore.

4014
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:07,050
They wiped.

4015
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:07,570
I'm coming back to you.

4016
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:09,390
There's a drop here, though.

4017
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:09,710
Okay.

4018
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:10,790
We're so healthy.

4019
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:11,830
What's in the drop?

4020
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:12,150
Come on.

4021
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:12,790
I don't know.

4022
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:13,190
I can't see.

4023
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:14,150
We don't have a scan for Scamisher.

4024
01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:16,390
I'm gonna put my Lumba down now and try to get it.

4025
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,490
Okay.

4026
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:17,490
Oh, you're gonna get it?

4027
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:17,710
Okay.

4028
01:54:17,970 --> 01:54:18,710
Oh, you wanna go do it?

4029
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:18,850
Yeah.

4030
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:20,270
Do you believe in me?

4031
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:21,550
Yeah.

4032
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:22,570
Okay.

4033
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:24,370
With your belief, I can do this.

4034
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:24,910
Wait, did you...

4035
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:24,990
Okay.

4036
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:28,450
Let me know when it's dropping and then I'll go all in.

4037
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:30,290
I'm gonna throw...

4038
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:32,390
I'm gonna throw my Hemlock.

4039
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:34,050
Actually, I'll throw my...

4040
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:35,570
That team just ran into that building?

4041
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:36,390
That's fine.

4042
01:54:36,410 --> 01:54:36,510
Yeah.

4043
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:37,210
They're running right side.

4044
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:37,970
Is it down?

4045
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:39,010
There's a full team up here?

4046
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,510
It is not down yet.

4047
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:40,650
No.

4048
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:41,330
I saw it.

4049
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:42,070
You're gigantic football.

4050
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:42,130
I saw it.

4051
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:42,130
You're gigantic football.

4052
01:54:42,150 --> 01:54:42,590
Okay.

4053
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:44,010
There's a team behind us as well, guys.

4054
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:46,330
Team behind us on our north east, right where that fence was.

4055
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:47,510
Should I go for it now?

4056
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:48,250
Yeah.

4057
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:48,610
You should.

4058
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:48,750
Yeah.

4059
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:49,170
You should.

4060
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:49,770
Smoke it, though.

4061
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:51,050
Make sure you smoke it and drop your gun first.

4062
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:51,550
I did.

4063
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:52,550
Okay.

4064
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:52,830
Nice.

4065
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:53,250
You did it.

4066
01:54:54,030 --> 01:54:54,630
I did it.

4067
01:54:58,210 --> 01:54:58,830
It's a bow check.

4068
01:54:58,890 --> 01:54:59,330
Can't see that.

4069
01:54:59,670 --> 01:54:59,950
Okay.

4070
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:00,470
That's pretty ass.

4071
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:01,310
I'm gonna lie.

4072
01:55:01,410 --> 01:55:01,910
I'm looking for you.

4073
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:02,810
I'm gonna shoot for you.

4074
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:03,450
You're good.

4075
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:03,610
You're good.

4076
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:03,870
You're good.

4077
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:04,210
I got you.

4078
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:04,570
I got you.

4079
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,090
You're good.

4080
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:06,910
You're vibing.

4081
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:07,250
What's your...

4082
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:08,050
Okay.

4083
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:08,670
I'm gonna grab it.

4084
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:08,970
Okay.

4085
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:10,330
Now we're gonna listen to me.

4086
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:10,470
Ready?

4087
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:11,410
We're gonna listen to me real quick.

4088
01:55:12,190 --> 01:55:12,470
Okay.

4089
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:13,090
Northeast team behind us.

4090
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:14,170
You guys see where northeast is on the map?

4091
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:14,430
Tempo?

4092
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:14,570
Yeah.

4093
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:15,610
Tempo, you need to listen to me or two?

4094
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:15,850
Yeah.

4095
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:16,450
Tempo, you need to listen to me.

4096
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:16,850
Okay.

4097
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:18,290
Northeast is going to push us.

4098
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:19,730
So we need more barrels on our first floor.

4099
01:55:19,950 --> 01:55:21,010
This team is going to fight us.

4100
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:21,850
I have...

4101
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:22,010
100%.

4102
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:22,950
They have no choice but to.

4103
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:25,070
All of this if anyone wants it.

4104
01:55:25,550 --> 01:55:25,930
No choice.

4105
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:26,270
I got a kill.

4106
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:27,950
Tempo!

4107
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,830
Okay.

4108
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:30,050
Now, Tempo, focus on the northeast side.

4109
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:30,270
Come here.

4110
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:31,230
Get this barrel out of here.

4111
01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:31,770
That's northeast.

4112
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:32,670
Top left.

4113
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:33,310
No.

4114
01:55:33,310 --> 01:55:33,530
Here.

4115
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:33,810
Here.

4116
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,410
Look at your compass.

4117
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:34,710
No.

4118
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:35,510
Look at your compass.

4119
01:55:36,270 --> 01:55:36,990
These are our compass.

4120
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:38,950
Northeast and southeast.

4121
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:40,230
This is the two teams that are going to fight us.

4122
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:40,450
Okay.

4123
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:41,210
Northeast as well.

4124
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,910
These are the two squads.

4125
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:44,250
Let's get some barrels down so they play our first floor.

4126
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:47,470
If they play our first floor, we just hold inside stairs and you cost a goldy first.

4127
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:48,430
You cost a goldy.

4128
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:49,030
Okay?

4129
01:55:49,090 --> 01:55:49,310
All right.

4130
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:50,310
You want me to...

4131
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,850
Don't hit me in the head.

4132
01:55:52,190 --> 01:55:53,930
I threw stuff on first floor.

4133
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:54,770
Nice.

4134
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:55,030
Good job.

4135
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,510
We're good.

4136
01:55:57,770 --> 01:55:58,890
We're just going to watch that southeast side.

4137
01:55:58,930 --> 01:55:59,690
I'm going to keep scanning it for us.

4138
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:00,810
You see that team I'm scanning?

4139
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,650
They're dropping down.

4140
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:01,750
They're dropping down.

4141
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:03,590
I'm going to ult.

4142
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:04,350
I'm going to ult this side.

4143
01:56:04,390 --> 01:56:04,490
Yeah.

4144
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:05,390
Ult the first floor.

4145
01:56:05,410 --> 01:56:06,030
Ult the first floor.

4146
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:06,410
Ult the first floor.

4147
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:08,150
Get ulti.

4148
01:56:08,150 --> 01:56:08,430
Get ulti.

4149
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:08,730
Get ulti.

4150
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:09,430
No, no.

4151
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,870
I can't.

4152
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:10,810
I can't open my door.

4153
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:11,890
Watch out.

4154
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,350
Watch out.

4155
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:12,690
I did.

4156
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:12,970
I did.

4157
01:56:13,070 --> 01:56:13,350
Nice.

4158
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:13,850
Get ulti.

4159
01:56:13,870 --> 01:56:14,170
Get ulti.

4160
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:14,410

We're good.

4176
01:56:36,410 --> 01:56:37,030
We got another team on the left side.

4177
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:37,450
We're good, we're good.

4178
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:39,370
They're sliding away.

4179
01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:39,670
We're chilling.

4180
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:39,930
We're chilling.

4181
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:40,390
Good job.

4182
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:40,910
Good job.

01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:41,370
Loot up later.

4184
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:41,990
Don't loot right now.

4185
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:42,450
Just play slow.

4186
01:56:42,970 --> 01:56:43,530
Nice job.

4187
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:45,030
Yeah.

4188
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:49,110
We're doing great.

4189
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:49,450
I'm watching.

4190
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:50,410
I'm watching the stair door thing.

4191
01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:51,330
Yep.

4192
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:51,490
Yep.

4193
01:56:51,490 --> 01:56:51,950
We're still in.

4194
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:55,170
Good job.

4195
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:55,870
They're scanning us again.

4196
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:56,530
Yeah.

4197
01:56:56,530 --> 01:56:56,730
We're good.

4198
01:56:56,770 --> 01:56:56,790
I'm watching.

4199
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:57,310

4200
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:58,310
Yeah, yep.

Good job.

4204
01:57:00,130 --> 01:57:01,110
I don't think that'll work.

4205
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:02,170
No, it's really bad.

4206
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:03,730
I'm looking at them from here.

4207
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:04,770
I'm still looking with digi.

4208
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:05,710
I'm with you too.

4209
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:06,870
I cracked one.

4210
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:08,590
Nice shot, Stokie.

4211
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:09,010
Good shit, yeah.

4212
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:11,050
I need like energy though soon.

4213
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:11,670
I need like energy though soon.

4214
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:11,710
I'm here.

4215
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:12,730
I'm gonna dump you somewhere here.

4216
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,070
Step here.

4217
01:57:13,210 --> 01:57:13,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4218
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:14,470
Maybe don't.

4219
01:57:14,510 --> 01:57:14,930
Maybe don't.

4220
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:16,310
Come to stairs.

4221
01:57:16,450 --> 01:57:16,650
Come to stairs.

4222
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:16,990
You're good.

4223
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:17,290
Okay, okay.

4224
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:17,630
You're good?

4225
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:19,050
Yeah.

4226
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:19,450
Got it.

4227
01:57:19,730 --> 01:57:20,670
I'm still looking stairs.

4228
01:57:21,110 --> 01:57:21,770
Yeah, you're vibing.

4229
01:57:21,790 --> 01:57:22,130
You're good.

4230
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:22,970
We should be good.

4231
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:24,270
I'm gonna look out with my...

4232
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:24,430
Oh!

4233
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:25,350
That's mine.

4234
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:25,810
That's my smoke.

4235
01:57:26,110 --> 01:57:26,630
It's her smoke.

4236
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:26,890
That's her smoke.

4237
01:57:26,890 --> 01:57:27,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4238
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,690
We're good.

4239
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:29,970
We're good.

4240
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:30,210
We're good.

4241
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:31,850
You can even play first if you need.

4242
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:32,450
We're vibing.

4243
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:33,590
There's a lot of batteries down here.

4244
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:34,990
Yeah, I got a lot of bats.

4245
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:35,950
Okay.

4246
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:38,110
Tempo, how long is your ulti?

4247
01:57:38,110 --> 01:57:38,330
Do you know?

4248
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,970
I'm at 40%.

4249
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:40,790
Okay.

4250
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:42,310
I'm using my charge rifle though.

4251
01:57:42,710 --> 01:57:43,190
You're good.

4252
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:44,030
Do your thing.

4253
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:44,930
We're vibing.

4254
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:46,390
Oh my god.

4255
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:47,010
There's so much energy.

4256
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:49,250
I have like alt-accel if people need it.

4257
01:57:49,490 --> 01:57:50,090
These guys...

4258
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:52,530
There's two down over here.

4259
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:52,990
Here, here.

4260
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:54,130
Tempo alt-accel.

4261
01:57:56,090 --> 01:57:56,630
Yeah, Tempo.

4262
01:57:56,630 --> 01:57:57,310
Definitely take one if you need.

4263
01:57:57,410 --> 01:57:57,690
Take it.

4264
01:57:57,790 --> 01:57:57,970
Take it.

4265
01:57:58,590 --> 01:57:59,490
We gotta kill these guys.

4266
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:00,290
These guys are alright when they walk in.

4267
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:02,130
I'm trying to kill these guys.

4268
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:03,110
There's two down over there.

4269
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:03,610
What?

4270
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:04,130
Left side here?

4271
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:05,890
I mean, I can... I'm needed.

4272
01:58:06,970 --> 01:58:08,370
Yeah, I'm just scanning one sec.

4273
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:09,770
They are there.

4274
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:10,330
Oh, they're so far.

4275
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:10,950
I'm going down.

4276
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:12,090
I'm going down to first floor.

4277
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:13,110
That's my bad, boys.

4278
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:13,750
I just fast-finger.

4279
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:14,770
Oh, it's okay.

4280
01:58:15,730 --> 01:58:16,230
It's unfortunate.

4281
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:19,190
Do you need this alt-accel, Tempo?

4282
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:19,910
Because I'm going to use it.

4283
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:20,650
We're not going to need to.

4284
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:22,470
No, you should take it, Doki, if you don't have it.

4285
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,690
Okay.

4286
01:58:22,850 --> 01:58:23,610
I'm going to use it then.

4287
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:24,190
I'm going to use it.

4288
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:25,450
I'm at 43%.

4289
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,350
Alright.

4290
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:28,090
We're going to try to swing this right side, okay?

4291
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:28,670
Okay.

4292
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:31,290
You don't have alt-tempo or no?

4293
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:32,470
No, no alt-tempo.

4294
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:33,670
I already tell alt-t.

4295
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:36,770
Oh, Tempo, I'm asking you to need it.

4296
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:38,470
Good, good, good.

4297
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:40,390
We're going to swing right side.

4298
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:41,150
I fast-finger my alt-t anyway.

4299
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:42,130
We're going to swing this right side, okay?

4300
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:42,530
We have to.

4301
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:42,810
We have a choice.

4302
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:44,810
Do you have alt-t though, Doki?

4303
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:45,870
Can you alt-t these guys on the right first?

4304
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:46,510
No, 86, 86.

4305
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:47,610
Oh, shit.

4306
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:47,890
Okay.

4307
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,670
We'll see what happens then.

4308
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:50,750
On the left now, too.

4309
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:51,670
I can smoke.

4310
01:58:52,130 --> 01:58:52,630
Are we smoking?

4311
01:58:52,850 --> 01:58:54,150
Yo, you guys want to stop shooting?

4312
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:54,950
Okay.

4313
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:56,090
Now, it's good smoke.

4314
01:58:56,150 --> 01:58:56,850
We're going to get underneath them.

4315
01:58:56,850 --> 01:58:57,990
Just get underneath them and look backwards, okay?

4316
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:59,350
Go now, go now, go now, go now, go now.

4317
01:58:59,630 --> 01:59:00,190
On the left.

4318
01:59:00,290 --> 01:59:01,370
Oh my god, the solo.

4319
01:59:02,610 --> 01:59:03,510
Shoot the solo.

4320
01:59:03,630 --> 01:59:04,150
Shoot the solo on the left side.

4321
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:04,770
We're dead.

4322
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:05,230
We can't do anything.

4323
01:59:05,390 --> 01:59:06,190
There's no way.

4324
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:08,070
There's not enough people alive for us to do anything.

4325
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:08,670
GG's.

4326
01:59:09,450 --> 01:59:09,810
GG's.

4327
01:59:09,990 --> 01:59:10,730
Hey, we'll take that.

4328
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:11,510
We literally can't do anything.

4329
01:59:11,870 --> 01:59:12,610
We'll take that.

4330
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:15,490
I didn't know...

4331
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:15,870
Yeah.

4332
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:18,150
I mean, we got so many kills though.

4333
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:19,510
We're definitely qualified.

4334
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:20,450
Oh, no.

4335
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:21,710
We definitely did a good job, guys.

4336
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:22,850
That was good.

4337
01:59:22,890 --> 01:59:23,890
We played that really good.

4338
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:24,470
That 3v3.

4339
01:59:24,570 --> 01:59:25,330
Like, really well.

4340
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:25,870
Nice job.

4341
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4342
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:27,830
We got so many kills.

4343
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:29,490
That 4-10.

4344
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,250
Yeah, that 4-10.

4345
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:33,290
Helped so much.

4346
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:34,130
Yeah, welcome.

4347
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:35,350
That assault.

4348
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:36,670
Everyone's just smoking.

4349
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:38,490
I'm just like, not today, bitches.

4350
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:40,130
Assaulting on me.

4351
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:50,540
Yeah, I don't think... We had such a poor rotation into the zone.

4352
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:54,940
I mean, that's so difficult for us because there's not enough teams alive.

4353
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:55,580
Yeah, yeah.

4354
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:57,160
To help us for the rotation.

4355
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:58,420
Exactly.

4356
01:59:58,660 --> 01:59:58,960
Yeah.

4357
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:01,100
We backed from behind or something?

4358
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:02,520
Do we have a behind to even...

4359
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:03,640
I think we died.

4360
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,820
Yeah, I don't think we did.

4361
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:05,140
Yeah.

4362
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:08,820
I think we should have maybe smoked that team off and swung the sun.

4363
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:09,540
I got the KPS.

4364
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:09,860
My bad.

4365
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:11,320
I just didn't think that team was gonna...

4366
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,800
That solo was gonna stay there the whole time.

4367
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:13,340
Be able to shoot us.

4368
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:13,780
It was crazy.

4369
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:15,740
I think that solo died.

4370
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:16,780
That solo is dead now.

4371
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:17,740
Yeah, he is.

4372
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:18,600
He died right after us.

4373
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:19,400
Literally right after.

4374
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:20,140
God damn it.

4375
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:21,580
How did they creep us?

4376
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:22,620
I know.

4377
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:23,040
He was...

4378
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,880
I know.

4379
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,520
We're streaming.

4380
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:24,660
That was crazy.

4381
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:25,300
Part 2 is to the top of the rock.

4382
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:27,360
We're on top of the rock.

4383
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,840
And I'm like, what are you doing?

4384
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,160
You're not gonna make any content.

4385
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,240
You're just solo.

4386
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:32,680
Hello?

4387
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:35,340
Yeah, you fucking shitbags.

4388
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:36,200
That's me.

4389
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:37,880
That's me making content.

4390
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,220
Let the streamer live.

4391
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:42,020
That is crazy.

4392
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,020
We need the content.

4393
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,140
We're here to content farm.

4394
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:50,380
Yeah, they fucking farm that endgame.

4395
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:50,860
Holy shit.

4396
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:54,440
What's fourth place for?

4397
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:55,640
That's... what's... 9 points?

4398
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,220
9 points.

4399
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,140
That's pretty good.

4400
02:00:57,140 --> 02:00:57,840
9 points.

4401
02:00:57,920 --> 02:00:58,340
Wait a minute.

4402
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:59,180
Yeah, we'll take that.

4403
02:00:59,220 --> 02:00:59,900
That's a great game for us.

4404
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:00,080
Yeah.

4405
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:04,780
If 3, 4, and 5 fucked up, then we might be in third.

4406
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:05,920
Oh, shit.

4407
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:06,280
No way.

4408
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,960
No, I don't think they... I don't think they died.

4409
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:08,540
I appreciate that.

4410
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:12,020
That was probably top 3 right there, to be honest.

4411
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,600
I've been taking gas by 3, 4, 5.

4412
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,040
Good job, though.

4413
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:15,440
Let's go.

4414
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:16,060
We did it!

4415
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:17,800
Good shit, guys.

4416
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:18,280
Next round.

4417
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:18,780
F5.

4418
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:19,300
F5.

4419
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:19,980
Okay, okay, okay.

4420
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:21,360
Let's... Are you ready to change your names?

4421
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:22,660
Remember to put TSM in the front.

4422
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:23,840
No, I'll change my name too.

4423
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:24,180
I got you.

4424
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:24,800
Actually, we know.

4425
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:25,540
We can't change our names.

4426
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:25,900
Why?

4427
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,480
Because then we have to change it on Battlefy.

4428
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:28,440
And that's fucked up.

4429
02:01:28,620 --> 02:01:29,640
Oh, really?

4430
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4431
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:33,740
We can't even, like, add stuff in front of our names?

4432
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:34,620
No, wait.

4433
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:35,020
No, no.

4434
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:35,800
There is a way.

4435
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:37,240
Wait.

4436
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:38,780
You have to click your profile.

4437
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,520
Yeah.

4438
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:40,820
Nope.

4439
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:42,240
Where's the thingy?

4440
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:42,440
No.

4441
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:46,100
Someone said there's a way you can add a thing to your name.

4442
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,340
I want to add stuff to our names, though.

4443
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:49,200
Oh, there we go.

4444
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:49,740
I found it.

4445
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:50,380
No way.

4446
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:50,600
Where'd it go?

4447
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:50,860
Yep.

4448
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,280
Go to your friends list.

4449
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:53,040
Yeah.

4450
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:55,420
And then there's a tag on the left side.

4451
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,080
A friends list?

4452
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:58,220
And there's a tag?

4453
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:59,620
She wants to do a tag.

4454
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:01,840
She wants to do a tag instead of the actual change in the name itself.

4455
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,240
I get it.

4456
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,620
Yeah, but would they still see it?

4457
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:04,640
Yeah.

4458
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:05,140
They can see it.

4459
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:06,300
Wait, wait.

4460
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:07,140
How do I do it?

4461
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,620
So, friends list?

4462
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:09,180
Yeah.

4463
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:12,000
And then on the left side, there's a thing called tag.

4464
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:13,360
Mmm.

4465
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:14,720
I want to look that up after this.

4466
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,400
I'm watching this fucking mod now.

4467
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:15,740
Okay, okay.

4468
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,440
I'm going to hide my Apex.

4469
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:19,060
Friends list.

4470
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:20,680
Good job of not dying, by the way.

4471
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:21,420
Oh!

4472
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:21,620
Oh!

4473
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:21,980
Okay.

4474
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:22,640
Add TSM.

4475
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:24,440
Yeah, I will.

4476
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:24,840
For sure.

4477
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:25,600
I'll do TSM as well.

4478
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:26,140
Yeah, yeah.

4479
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:26,660
There you go.

4480
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:29,060
All I know...

4481
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:33,240
All right.

4482
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,420
I'll be right back real quick, guys.

4483
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:34,920
Let me...

4484
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:35,720
You're just griefing people.

4485
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,120
DM the code when it's ready.

4486
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:37,700
All right?

4487
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:37,940
Yeah, yeah.

4488
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,260
I mean, we have like a 10-minute intervention interview.

4489
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:40,740
Yo!

4490
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,040
We're in fourth.

4491
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:42,780
What?

4492
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:43,780
Oh, we improved!

4493
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:44,420
We improved!

4494
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:45,560
We improved.

4495
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,060
We went from five to four.

4496
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:47,420
Yeah!

4497
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:48,340
We did!

4498
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:49,000
Oh, dude.

4499
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:49,920
Guys, guys.

4500
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:53,780
Even though there's less teams, we... technically, it's an improvement.

4501
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:55,140
That's what I'm talking about.

4502
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:55,940
Top four, guys.

4503
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,320
Good shit.

4504
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:56,900
Top four.

4505
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:57,680
We got better.

4506
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,460
Oh, my God.

4507
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,800
At this rate, we might have a chance to...

4508
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:03,700
First place has a hundred...

4509
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:05,900
First place has a hundred and two points.

4510
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,500
We don't think about the first place team.

4511
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:08,340
We don't think.

4512
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:09,160
Clearly.

4513
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,940
They're like actual Pred players.

4514
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:13,220
We have not been Pred for a very...

4515
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:14,780
Teemu, you've never been Pred too.

4516
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:15,300
So like...

4517
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,680
Hey.

4518
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,580
I got Masters once, okay?

4519
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,300
Oh my God.

4520
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,140
Holy shit.

4521
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:23,180
Season 17, okay?

4522
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:24,020
Season 17.

4523
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,400
You've never been Pred.

4524
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,700
That was crazy.

4525
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:27,960
Oh my God!

4526
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:31,080
And it was the season 17 Masters?

4527
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:32,860
Yeah, season 17 Masters, man.

4528
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:35,880
Oh my god, was that the easiest season to get Masters?

4529
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,640
We don't talk about that.

4530
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:40,240
Oh, okay, sorry, we don't talk about that part though, obviously.

4531
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,860
Yeah, we just talk about season 17 was Masters, okay?

4532
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:49,420
Oh man, alright, wow, good shit guys, let's fucking go.

4533
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,100
Let's fucking go.

4534
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:52,960
Let's go.

4535
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:56,700
I am way more locked in this week than last week, I'll tell you that much right now.

4536
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:58,420
My eyes are open now.

4537
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:00,780
Yeah, your eyes are actually seeing normal FPS.

4538
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:05,360
Yeah, I'm seeing normal FPS and like I'm not as tired anymore.

4539
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:05,760
I'm not lying.

4540
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:09,000
Give a round of applause, dude.

4541
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:11,040
I'm doing it, guys.

4542
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,800
The queen of sleep right here.

4543
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,400
Guys, I did it.

4544
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:17,020
I'm so proud of all of us.

4545
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,280
I'm so...

4546
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:23,140
Some of my chats said my wife's laugh is very distinctive like Doki's.

4547
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:24,680
It's really easy to locate her.

4548
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:28,120
Like the last puppy.

4549
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:32,760
If I had you at a convention, I would know exactly where Doki is every time.

4550
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:34,260
100%.

4551
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:36,700
I'd be in the middle of the convention to hear that laugh.

4552
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:38,060
I'd be like, oh my god, southeast.

4553
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:38,940
Doki.

4554
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:40,600
5 meters.

4555
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,520
5 meters.

4556
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:45,840
It's the Doki GPS.

4557
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:48,580
Literally, oh my god, that'd be awful.

4558
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:50,460
What do you mean awful?

4559
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,760
You telling me how to drive somewhere sounds...

4560
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:55,480
Like the closer you are, the louder the laugh gets.

4561
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:57,000
Oh my god.

4562
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:01,640
You know, there's things you can...

4563
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:09,060
There's like a mod that you can put on your Google Maps that you can replace with other people's voices.

4564
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:09,980
Wait, really?

4565
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,060
That's great.

4566
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:12,020
I would love...

4567
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:14,660
Just put Doki's voice on the Google Maps.

4568
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:15,920
Bro, I wanna release that.

4569
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:18,420
Wait, send me.

4570
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:21,140
I wanna release a Doki Bird GPS mod.

4571
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:22,680
Jesus Christ.

4572
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:23,820
This is so funny.

4573
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:26,780
Imagine the content.

4574
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:29,660
You know how the cars beep when you're closer?

4575
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:29,960
Yeah.

4576
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:34,420
When you're like parking and you're closer to a wall, you just hear Doki yelling, beep, beep, beep.

4577
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:38,460
I can't believe you got two kills, bro.

4578
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,020
You're the GOAT.

4579
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,520
Oh my god.

4580
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:41,760
Here's the school bus.

4581
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:43,960
But remember who helped him get those two kills.

4582
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,340
We're all spitting now, spitting.

4583
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:47,540
Let him go.

4584
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:49,560
I love the school bus charge.

4585
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,120
This motherfucker said, what's northeast?

4586
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,780
Yeah, it's like, look at the compass.

4587
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:54,920
Look up.

4588
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:55,580
No.

4589
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,600
Wait, wait.

4590
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:57,500
Northeast?

4591
02:05:58,520 --> 02:05:59,980
You gotta say top right.

4592
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:03,120
That's the exact opposite of what you should be saying.

4593
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:03,820
No, no.

4594
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:06,060
Northeast is... yeah, northeast is top right.

4595
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:07,700
Bro, what do you mean?

4596
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,160
That's not top east.

4597
02:06:09,220 --> 02:06:10,420
That's not my right.

4598
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:11,640
No, what are you saying?

4599
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:13,900
That's not... top east?

4600
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:15,360
That's not... sorry, northeast.

4601
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:18,460
You broke my brain just then with that statement.

4602
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,280
You actually...

4603
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:25,500
There's no way you guys... okay, I'm looking at the... I'm looking at that compass thingy.

4604
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:26,100
Yeah.

4605
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:27,600
You guys actually use that?

4606
02:06:28,020 --> 02:06:28,500
Yes.

4607
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:29,640
Yes.

4608
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:30,560
Of course.

4609
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:31,360
Quite frequently, actually.

4610
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:31,700
Yeah.

4611
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:34,400
I have to learn to use it for a competitive.

4612
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:35,360
What are you...

4613
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:35,620
Yeah.

4614
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:37,760
Quite frequently, I use that, actually.

4615
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:38,300
What?

4616
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:40,100
Tempo.

4617
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:42,280
People in competitive use the compass.

4618
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:43,600
All the time.

4619
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:44,060
Yes.

4620
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:48,280
Yeah, I have trouble using the compass when I'm not playing competitive.

4621
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:48,680
Okay.

4622
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:51,020
TSM fucking always uses the... what are you...

4623
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:54,380
I've never met a human that can smell...

4624
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:56,620
I gotta go... you know that never eat...

4625
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:57,200
Oh, and you love this man.

4626
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:02,760
Never eat shredded wheat or never enter stinky...

4627
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:03,040
What is happening?

4628
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:04,980
Never enter stinky washroom.

4629
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:05,440
You know?

4630
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,520
That's how you tell which way the compass goes around.

4631
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:09,020
What?

4632
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:09,920
What is going on?

4633
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,520
You go N, E, S, and then W.

4634
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,200
And then you go over in a circle.

4635
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:14,600
What?

4636
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:15,460
Yeah.

4637
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4638
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:19,840
I gotta do that every time someone tells me directions in that sense.

4639
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:20,460
Okay.

4640
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:20,880
Okay.

4641
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:21,400
Oh my God.

4642
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:24,360
Bro, you're a real person.

4643
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:26,180
That's not a real human.

4644
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:26,880
He's a real human.

4645
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:27,600
He's a real person.

4646
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:35,940
I'm listening to country songs right now to smooth me out.

4647
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:37,280
Take the stress off.

4648
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:37,720
This is great.

4649
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:39,840
It could have been the drink.

4650
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:44,580
What did we tell Tempo when we said we'll buy him another free meal?

4651
02:07:45,260 --> 02:07:46,240
Or you'll buy him...

4652
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:47,460
Oh yeah, I didn't go on a roof.

4653
02:07:47,580 --> 02:07:48,780
I was on a second floor.

4654
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,860
Yeah, so he didn't go on the roof, but then we did...

4655
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:51,960
And we got top five.

4656
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:53,740
Was it top five?

4657
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:54,240
I don't know.

4658
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:55,580
Top five, right?

4659
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:57,680
Was it top five or was it top three?

4660
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:58,740
I don't remember.

4661
02:07:59,160 --> 02:07:59,260
What did we say?

4662
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:00,340
I think it was top five.

4663
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:01,140
Top five?

4664
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:01,660
Top five.

4665
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,160
I think it was like this game.

4666
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:05,980
I have no idea, but we're in top five regardless.

4667
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:08,660
Yeah, so... but did we die top five?

4668
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:09,760
Did we die top five?

4669
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:11,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4670
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:11,760
I don't remember.

4671
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:12,900
We died fourth.

4672
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:13,380
We died fourth.

4673
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:14,080
Oh, we died fourth.

4674
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:14,460
Okay.

4675
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,200
No, we died third.

4676
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,660
Tempo, we need... Okay, my bad.

4677
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:18,180
I didn't mean to cut you off.

4678
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:20,720
But Tempo, when we're late game, bro, let's prioritize your ulti.

4679
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:20,840
Like, you know, like...

4680
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:23,040
Like, if you don't have it, you need to pop ulti-exels like immediately.

4681
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:24,080
My brain...

4682
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:26,060
You and Doki are probably just more important than me.

4683
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:30,160
My brain was trying to figure out how to swap my gun.

4684
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:34,320
Wait, was that why you weren't listening to me when I asked you?

4685
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:35,720
Wait, no way.

4686
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,340
Tempo, do you need the ulti-exel?

4687
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:37,720
I was healing.

4688
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:38,020
I was healing.

4689
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:39,820
No, I am literally watching this.

4690
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:41,980
You were like fucking staring at the boxes.

4691
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:45,280
Wait, how do I... How do I turn off my stream?

4692
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:48,880
You were literally staring at the boxes.

4693
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:49,520
Don't look, Doki.

4694
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:55,080
Tempo, I asked you like three times, do you need the ulti-exel?

4695
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:57,160
And I didn't get zero responses.

4696
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:00,040
Okay, okay.

4697
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:02,480
To be fair, Chrono knows this very well.

4698
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:05,140
When I'm playing Apex, my brain is not all there.

4699
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:08,320
Bro, my chat got some points.

4700
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:11,820
Even my chat is 10 minutes late and now she asked like three times.

4701
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,560
Merry Christmas.

4702
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,360
No one saw anything, okay?

4703
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,500
I'm deleting this bot.

4704
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:22,080
No, no, no.

4705
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:23,820
I'm deleting this bot.

4706
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:25,060
No, we all saw it.

4707
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:30,840
I just opened my chat and the first thing I hear is... first thing I see is he's still looting for some reason.

4708
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:33,220
That is not believable, bro.

4709
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:36,400
Oh, fuck.

4710
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:37,840
The bot is deleted.

4711
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:39,980
I don't know what anyone is talking about.

4712
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:41,280
Oh my god.

4713
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:44,700
Deleting the bot off that is crazy.

4714
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:48,880
That was the moment you had to delete the bot.

4715
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:50,340
Okay, alright.

4716
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:51,000
Oh, it's not out yet, Timber, right?

4717
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:51,820
No.

4718
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:54,480
No, it's not out yet.

4719
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:57,620
I'm playing literally a game right now with octets running around so...

4720
02:09:57,620 --> 02:09:59,760
Wait, you're fucking playing a game about us?

4721
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:00,660
Yeah.

4722
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:01,500
What the fuck?

4723
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:01,900
Invite us!

4724
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:04,040
Oh, I'm already in the game.

4725
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:04,540
Leave!

4726
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:06,880
No, I'm gonna get a timer.

4727
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,580
And then my warmup session is shocked.

4728
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:10,760
Why are you leaving?

4729
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:11,660
Where are you at?

4730
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:12,620
I'm gonna go on a duo.

4731
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:14,760
Yeah, go do a duo.

4732
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,020
I'm gonna do a duo.

4733
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:16,840
Keep that aim warm.

4734
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:17,440
Keep that aim warm.

4735
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:19,340
I'm gonna get that aim.

4736
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:22,840
Oh, this kid's a fucking shit head.

4737
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:23,780
Whoa!

4738
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:27,880
Bro, can this fucking movement wannabe just stop?

4739
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:29,660
I'm playing a team deathmatch, bro.

4740
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:34,560
You're playing a deathmatch?

4741
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:35,520
There's a deathmatch?

4742
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:38,420
I also saw it's locked down in the other one.

4743
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,500
No, there's a deathmatch.

4744
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,260
Maybe I got the last one for the hour or something?

4745
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:42,320
Oh, yeah, it's gone.

4746
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:43,780
It's like control and lockdown.

4747
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:46,020
There's no way I'm playing control.

4748
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,620
Yeah, no shot.

4749
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:48,040
No.

4750
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:50,660
I'm done with that shit.

4751
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:54,320
It's okay.

4752
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:54,960
Don't worry.

4753
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,200
You're gonna see me so...

4754
02:10:56,200 --> 02:11:01,320
Chat, this is gonna be the only time you see me actually getting to kill somebody.

4755
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:03,440
Yeah?

4756
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:05,380
The only time?

4757
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:11,820
The other times I cracked people but my teammates didn't finish the kills for me.

4758
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,820
I'm actually lowkey smart.

4759
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:19,020
I don't need a PK for the day.

4760
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:19,940
I'm going crazy right now.

4761
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:24,520
You say that but then it's gonna be like the part where...

4762
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:28,060
Oh my god, the TSM Doughkeeper is so fucking...

4763
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,980
In the public lobby.

4764
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:30,960
So cringe.

4765
02:11:36,650 --> 02:11:37,670
Oh my god.

4766
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:39,010
I'm lowkey snapping right now.

4767
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:39,570
What is going on?

4768
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:42,650
Who am I?

4769
02:11:42,850 --> 02:11:44,430
Who are... Who is this man?

4770
02:11:44,910 --> 02:11:46,070
I was not doing this at all.

4771
02:11:46,170 --> 02:11:46,530
Alright, chat.

4772
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:47,250
We made it to the next round.

4773
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:47,670
Oh, my bad.

4774
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:48,330
I'm muted.

4775
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:51,570
Wait, I wanna be part of your chat.

4776
02:11:51,630 --> 02:11:51,710
Oh, my god.

4777
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:51,710
I'm lowkey smart.

4778
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:51,710
I don't need a PK.

4779
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:52,890
Yeah, chat.

4780
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:54,630
We made it to the next round, dude.

4781
02:11:54,730 --> 02:11:55,090
We did it, chat.

4782
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:56,270
Round two, chat.

4783
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:56,770
Round two.

4784
02:11:56,910 --> 02:11:58,210
Yeah, I'm chat.

4785
02:11:58,830 --> 02:11:59,610
Yeah, you're chat.

4786
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:02,270
I'm that one viewer.

4787
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:02,770
Alright, we're back.

4788
02:12:02,770 --> 02:12:02,770
Only dunking.

4789
02:12:02,970 --> 02:12:03,450
Yeah.

4790
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:08,530
Shout out to that one viewer.

4791
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:11,970
Shout out to me, the one viewer.

4792
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:13,470
Shout out to you.

4793
02:12:14,030 --> 02:12:14,690
That's me.

4794
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:15,970
That's me.

4795
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:18,710
What the fuck?

4796
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:21,690
I'm jumping right now.

4797
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:22,350
I'm jumping right now in my game.

4798
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:24,950
You understand if you see my...

4799
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:25,510
She drove the car?

4800
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:27,050
If you see my POV, you'd understand.

4801
02:12:27,690 --> 02:12:28,510
Yeah, when I got it?

4802
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:29,150
A minute later.

4803
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:31,470
Alright.

4804
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:32,270
Yeah.

4805
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:35,490
Yeah, just wait until ten minutes later and you'll understand why I said that.

4806
02:12:38,410 --> 02:12:39,830
Got my triple take.

4807
02:12:39,890 --> 02:12:41,110
Wait, we have eight kills.

4808
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:43,130
Wait, how many kills did we have last time?

4809
02:12:44,290 --> 02:12:45,250
Definitely not eight.

4810
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:47,550
But we did have like several second places.

4811
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:49,810
And we haven't had a second place yet.

4812
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:52,030
How do I even see what we did last time?

4813
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:54,030
Nope.

4814
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:56,250
Guy is the most wannabe movement player in the world.

4815
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:57,090
What is this guy doing?

4816
02:12:58,110 --> 02:12:59,670
What are you fucking doing?

4817
02:13:00,790 --> 02:13:03,130
Why doesn't this kid just tap-stripe everything in these games?

4818
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:04,190
It hasn't hit a shot yet.

4819
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:07,510
Look, he's trying his best.

4820
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,490
We should laugh.

4821
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:12,130
And there's just me on pretty little roller.

4822
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:13,870
Yeah, like you don't need that.

4823
02:13:15,130 --> 02:13:17,680
The fuck?

4824
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:18,500
Who shot me?

4825
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:20,500
Oh my goodness.

4826
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:22,840
I found it.

4827
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:23,960
Found what?

4828
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:28,160
We had ten kills last time.

4829
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,580
Oh, so we didn't improve.

4830
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:31,680
No.

4831
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,160
We moved from the placements, you know?

4832
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:34,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4833
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:36,080
Overall, placements had to be better this time.

4834
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:37,480
Yeah, yeah, overall was better.

4835
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:38,360
Yeah, had to be.

4836
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:39,900
Nice.

4837
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:43,500
Oh, it says go to round two.

4838
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:45,060
Go to round what?

4839
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:47,200
I thought it said go to round two.

4840
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:48,240
I was looking at the wrong page.

4841
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:48,960
You're good, you're good.

4842
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:53,560
They got the first place got 102 points?

4843
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:54,320
Yeah, they did.

4844
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:55,240
Yeah.

4845
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,980
Oh my god damn.

4846
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,620
Yeah, we're definitely not that part of the league, we're not.

4847
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:02,800
No, we're not there yet.

4848
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:05,360
We're trying, we're like in the part where we try to sneak by.

4849
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:07,060
Yeah, we're the low key.

4850
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:09,020
We're just low key existing, you know.

4851
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:09,940
We're just there.

4852
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:12,920
We're just trying to get on by without anyone really recognizing us.

4853
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:15,580
Yeah, we're like just let us pass through, you know.

4854
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:16,860
We are not there yet.

4855
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:20,880
I'm gonna grab that.

4856
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:22,820
Oh wait, you guys aren't even in my game.

4857
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:23,940
Who am I telling this to?

4858
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,900
Grabbing that evil cash for my random.

4859
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:30,280
Nice, such a good teammate.

4860
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:34,040
I'm a good teammate.

4861
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:41,100
Is the code out?

4862
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:42,200
Oh no.

4863
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:44,420
Not out yet.

4864
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,200
Oh, the lobby.

4865
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:48,020
We got seeded so it's gonna start soon.

4866
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:49,100
Okay.

4867
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:51,140
Alright.

4868
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:56,620
This... this...

4869
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:03,500
Temple, you need to tell me about the GPS mod.

4870
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:07,920
I'm gonna fucking... my next release, I'll release a Dohybird GPS mod.

4871
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,360
I got it that way.

4872
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,280
You have to tell me how to do it.

4873
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:11,960
I'd buy it.

4874
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:14,580
I'd 100% buy it for you.

4875
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:16,140
I would buy the support.

4876
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:19,860
I would never use it because it would drive me actually insane.

4877
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:21,480
You would gotta use it.

4878
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:23,460
You have to use it for like a vlog.

4879
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:25,640
I would try it.

4880
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:26,100
I would try it.

4881
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:26,700
Just for you.

4882
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4883
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:33,720
I would literally spend my entire day voice acting that.

4884
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,740
Yeah, that's fire.

4885
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:36,860
That's actually such a good idea.

4886
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:37,920
Yeah, that would be so fun.

4887
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:40,500
Turn left.

4888
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:43,620
And I would release it for free too so no one has to pay for it.

4889
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:44,120
Wow.

4890
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:45,620
Yeah, I'm that nice.

4891
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:48,460
You're such a good person.

4892
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:48,840
I know.

4893
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:52,800
Oh my gosh, somebody stop me in my terrible deeds.

4894
02:15:53,380 --> 02:15:53,800
Yeah.

4895
02:15:55,060 --> 02:15:56,840
She needs to make money too guys.

4896
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:00,020
We gotta stop her.

4897
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:01,920
Somebody stop me.

4898
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:02,900
I'm just too nice.

4899
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:10,500
No way.

4900
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:11,640
I just no regged you brother.

4901
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:13,320
Yes way.

4902
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:13,900
I believe it.

4903
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:15,420
No way.

4904
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:16,680
I'm getting no regs out here brother.

4905
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:19,200
My team is really bad at this TDM.

4906
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:20,320
Holy shit.

4907
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:23,460
There we go.

4908
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:25,240
I'm carrying TDMs.

4909
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:25,640
You know there's a problem.

4910
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:27,480
You're carrying TDMs?

4911
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:28,720
Yeah, I have no idea.

4912
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:29,900
You know when that's happening we're shocked.

4913
02:16:33,740 --> 02:16:34,320
That's crazy.

4914
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:37,480
My stream can finally see me kill people.

4915
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:38,500
I'm so happy.

4916
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:40,360
Kid.

4917
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:42,980
He's the most movement nerd of all time.

4918
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,400
And just barely getting any shots.

4919
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:45,180
That's so funny.

4920
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,400
I look he respected grind though.

4921
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:47,940
I respect it.

4922
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,360
Maybe he's doing a TikTok right now.

4923
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:51,160
It's not about his kills.

4924
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:52,920
It's about those TikTok montages.

4925
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:53,780
True.

4926
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:56,820
Those like heavy basses.

4927
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:58,840
I love those.

4928
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:00,440
Yeah.

4929
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:02,760
That's your entire For You page.

4930
02:17:07,050 --> 02:17:08,390
Little sausage out of me.

4931
02:17:08,630 --> 02:17:12,710
My chat finally is at the part where we're talking about the compasses.

4932
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:16,190
Are they?

4933
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:19,250
I can't be the only one.

4934
02:17:19,450 --> 02:17:20,510
There's no way.

4935
02:17:21,430 --> 02:17:21,570
You're the only one.

4936
02:17:21,710 --> 02:17:22,570
No way.

4937
02:17:24,030 --> 02:17:25,530
You should ask them in the chat.

4938
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:27,830
You might be the only one.

4939
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:31,930
I got someone that said never eat soggy waffles.

4940
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:32,490
There you go.

4941
02:17:32,590 --> 02:17:33,190
I'm not the only one.

4942
02:17:33,330 --> 02:17:34,430
I know the soggy waffles one.

4943
02:17:34,530 --> 02:17:35,010
Yeah, I know that one.

4944
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:37,550
Yeah, but that means they fucking look at the compass.

4945
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:40,230
Pause.

4946
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:42,270
What do you mean pause?

4947
02:17:43,050 --> 02:17:45,850
I'm trying to figure out what to say.

4948
02:17:46,130 --> 02:17:48,330
What do you mean a pause?

4949
02:17:49,230 --> 02:17:51,050
They're like, who are you pausing for?

4950
02:17:55,170 --> 02:17:56,050
Oh shit.

4951
02:17:58,010 --> 02:18:00,450
Who are you pausing for?

4952
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:04,770
I'm getting bullied.

4953
02:18:04,970 --> 02:18:05,530
This is me.

4954
02:18:08,530 --> 02:18:10,150
Now you're getting...

4955
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:13,510
Oh wait, code is out?

4956
02:18:14,370 --> 02:18:15,470
Oh wait, my game's almost done.

4957
02:18:15,590 --> 02:18:15,830
Nice.

4958
02:18:16,610 --> 02:18:17,490
Alright, nice.

4959
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:17,930
Me too.

4960
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:18,970
How long till it starts up?

4961
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:19,970
Yeah, how long?

4962
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:20,250
How long?

4963
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:21,750
I'm going to go join now.

4964
02:18:21,990 --> 02:18:24,630
Okay, I'm going to call in a little bit because I can't leave or else I get a timer, right?

4965
02:18:25,890 --> 02:18:28,310
Oh yeah, you do get... he does get two lunches.

4966
02:18:30,350 --> 02:18:31,690
Because we said top five.

4967
02:18:32,150 --> 02:18:32,510
Yeah.

4968
02:18:32,510 --> 02:18:33,270
I'm sure you're so right.

4969
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:36,390
Oh shit, I'm supposed to figure out...

4970
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:38,770
Oh, where we're dropping?

4971
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:39,910
I'm not getting shot.

4972
02:18:40,610 --> 02:18:42,190
I'm almost done with my game too.

4973
02:18:42,850 --> 02:18:43,210
Um...

4974
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:49,960
Yeah, my game's almost done.

4975
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:51,540
My teammates are really bad, bro.

4976
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:53,440
I have 23 kills.

4977
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:54,700
I think that's like eight combined.

4978
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:57,240
I hear there's no like, SBMM in like, uh...

4979
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:58,120
Was it Mixed Eight?

4980
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:58,540
Yeah.

4981
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:00,000
I can't lie how bad this is.

4982
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:02,380
I've had moments where I was like, how is that a team?

4983
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:04,680
How is my team real?

4984
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:05,420
I have no idea.

4985
02:19:11,530 --> 02:19:11,950
Cascades.

4986
02:19:14,110 --> 02:19:14,530
Oh.

4987
02:19:15,370 --> 02:19:16,070
There you go.

4988
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:16,970
One down.

4989
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:21,310
No way I lose this game dropping 48 kills.

4990
02:19:21,390 --> 02:19:21,810
This is insane.

4991
02:19:21,810 --> 02:19:22,310
No way.

4992
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:24,610
I'd be very surprised.

4993
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:30,720
Oh no, my teammate.

4994
02:19:30,820 --> 02:19:31,380
Are you okay?

4995
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:34,000
Oh god, team, please.

4996
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:34,560
I'm losing.

4997
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:39,920
I have 20 and 24 out of our 44 kills, guys!

4998
02:19:40,300 --> 02:19:40,920
How did you lose?

4999
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,840
Someone help me, please!

5000
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,140
Use your hands!

5001
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,120
How is that possible?

5002
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:49,780
Please use your hands, guys.

5003
02:19:49,860 --> 02:19:50,320
Your fingers.

5004
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:52,600
Use anything.

5005
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:54,060
Oh, echo.

5006
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:58,000
Oh, this person typed echo.

5007
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,340
I was like, where is that POI?

5008
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:05,060
Great try, guys.

5009
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:05,720
We had a great game.

5010
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:06,760
Oh my god.

5011
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,340
I want to let everyone know on my team right now, bro, that you guys did nothing to contribute to this.

5012
02:20:12,580 --> 02:20:16,560
I was going to be like, whoa, you positive about your teammates?

5013
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:17,640
Hell no.

5014
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:18,400
Not in this situation.

5015
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:20,060
That's crazy.

5016
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:22,420
Wait, I'm not dead yet.

5017
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:23,540
I need one more kill.

5018
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:25,240
Oh my god, we need two more.

5019
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:26,060
Come on.

5020
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:30,340
I'm so sad.

5021
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,920
I think the last kill too.

5022
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:36,060
Oh my god, we lost the game.

5023
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:38,160
It's all your fault.

5024
02:20:38,380 --> 02:20:41,500
My teammates bot lobby.

5025
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:43,280
I think I'm in the bot lobby too.

5026
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:45,480
No way.

5027
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:46,040
I wouldn't doubt it.

5028
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:48,740
Sometimes they make the bots fight for XP and then they don't do shit.

5029
02:20:48,940 --> 02:20:50,080
They just shoot people who shoot them.

5030
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:52,040
We're waiting for you guys now.

5031
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:52,460
Is it just me?

5032
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:55,620
Oh shit, okay.

5033
02:20:56,260 --> 02:20:56,700
Sorry.

5034
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,380
I gotta go.

5035
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:01,640
I'm so sad.

5036
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:02,500
Okay, wait, where are we landing, Tubbo?

5037
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:03,520
I'm coming in.

5038
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:07,840
Okay, so right now, no one typed...

5039
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:08,940
I'm here.

5040
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:11,470
Zeus, Elrod, Command, or Stormcatcher.

5041
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:14,680
No, you don't see the TSM in front of me.

5042
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,040
You lied.

5043
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:17,920
Wait, do you not see it in front of me?

5044
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:19,340
They see it in the game.

5045
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:23,020
I also lied and I did not do it.

5046
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:23,260
I forgot.

5047
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:24,000
You didn't do it?

5048
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:25,660
No, I totally forgot about it.

5049
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:27,520
Go leave and do it now.

5050
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:28,280
They're gonna wait for you.

5051
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:30,680
They're gonna wait for you.

5052
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:32,440
No, the fuck they're not.

5053
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:35,660
Please, Wade needs to leave live.

5054
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:37,220
No, no, no.

5055
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:37,800
Stop.

5056
02:21:39,580 --> 02:21:40,140
No.

5057
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:42,220
I'm not risking this.

5058
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:43,000
JK.

5059
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:46,140
He's a coward.

5060
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:48,960
He's a coward?

5061
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:52,840
What the fuck, man.

5062
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:55,780
Oh, wait, wait.

5063
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:56,720
We actually have good teams in here.

5064
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:57,300
Oh, shit.

5065
02:21:58,420 --> 02:22:00,880
We got Pain.

5066
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:01,920
We got SQ.

5067
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:04,620
We got 00 Negative.

5068
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:07,080
I have no idea who any of these names are.

5069
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:07,560
Yeah, 00...

5070
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:09,580
You're not gonna know anybody ever.

5071
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:11,840
I think that's it, right?

5072
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,060
So just those three?

5073
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:14,500
They have three different teams.

5074
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:15,060
They're good.

5075
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:18,220
I would say this round two is easier than last week's round two.

5076
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:20,260
We're taking three different POIs though, okay?

5077
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:21,700
We got Zeus, Command, and Lightning Rod.

5078
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:23,040
We're taking all three.

5079
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,300
Yo, wait.

5080
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:28,180
You type Lightning Rod, just so people know.

5081
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:29,420
Alright, I'll type Lightning Rod.

5082
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:30,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5083
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:32,360
Oh, wait.

5084
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:36,780
How about all three of us type Lightning Rod and they'll think it's all three different teams because they don't pay attention.

5085
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,040
Okay, Lightning Rod.

5086
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:42,060
I type Lightning Rod too.

5087
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:44,660
So they'll think three different teams are going to Lightning Rod.

5088
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:45,320
Wait, wait, wait.

5089
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:45,960
Yeah, you're so right.

5090
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:46,580
Watch this, watch this.

5091
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:47,420
But...

5092
02:22:49,700 --> 02:22:50,060
See?

5093
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:54,840
You could be like, contesting team 11!

5094
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:57,800
Then it'll be even more confusing!

5095
02:22:58,300 --> 02:22:59,180
Okay, it'll be like...

5096
02:22:59,180 --> 02:23:00,740
There's like three teams landing...

5097
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:02,960
There's like three teams landing North Pad.

5098
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:05,320
I'll be like, contesting team 1.

5099
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:10,900
Contesting team 1, yes, dude.

5100
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:11,560
So confusing.

5101
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:14,280
People will be so fucking confused.

5102
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:21,300
It's gonna be great.

5103
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:23,340
So we're on Storm Point first, okay.

5104
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:24,260
Cool.

5105
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:25,900
W.

5106
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:27,260
We'll take it.

5107
02:23:27,580 --> 02:23:28,980
My team said...

5108
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:33,720
You would be the second person to die in a horror movie with that direction.

5109
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:35,320
What, you?

5110
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:39,180
I think I just caught up.

5111
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:41,220
Yeah, you would be the second.

5112
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:43,340
Wait, who's the first?

5113
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:44,980
I don't know.

5114
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:46,060
He's dead first.

5115
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:47,640
Why would it be me?

5116
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:49,180
I know my cardinal directions!

5117
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:49,940
I know my cardinal directions!

5118
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:51,680
No, no.

5119
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,740
Tempo is 100% first dead in a horror movie.

5120
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:55,560
Yeah, I'd take the second place.

5121
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:56,960
That's messed up.

5122
02:23:57,020 --> 02:23:59,800
I would survive in a zombie thingy.

5123
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:00,740
No you won't.

5124
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:01,860
No you would not.

5125
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,940
I would be the zombie.

5126
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:07,800
Oh, because...

5127
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:10,520
I think I'd be the...

5128
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:14,640
I think Tempo's gonna die first, then Wig, then me, because I...

5129
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,000
The moment Wig gets in trouble, I'm gonna run away.

5130
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:18,580
Oh my god.

5131
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:20,320
You're just leaving?

5132
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:21,980
I'm out!

5133
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:25,660
100% it's all about survival.

5134
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:29,660
Wait, someone said grief team... are we fighting a team off swan?

5135
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:32,480
No, no, I think they just want us to land on team 4.

5136
02:24:34,640 --> 02:24:37,180
They want us to land on team 4 or something.

5137
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:38,360
They want us to land on team 4 or something.

5138
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:39,940
Just type SQ, I'm never gonna watch you again.

5139
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:40,480
Wait, I've got code net.

5140
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,080
Oh wait, code net?

5141
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:44,980
Oh, Wig got code net.

5142
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,320
Wait, change your name!

5143
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:47,880
Tag!

5144
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:48,620
Do your tag!

5145
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,160
I don't know how to do that.

5146
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:50,840
I don't remember what it was.

5147
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:52,760
Change your friends list, and then there's a tag.

5148
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:53,980
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

5149
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:56,900
Wait, I knew it!

5150
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:57,940
Oh my god!

5151
02:24:58,560 --> 02:24:59,740
Wait, it happened for a reason.

5152
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:00,420
It all happened for a reason.

5153
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:01,980
It happened for a reason!

5154
02:25:02,260 --> 02:25:03,020
Are you back?

5155
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:03,800
He's back now?

5156
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:04,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5157
02:25:05,020 --> 02:25:05,700
Okay, okay, okay.

5158
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:09,840
Nice.

5159
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:10,580
Look at that.

5160
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:11,400
I knew it.

5161
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:12,460
I didn't remove from the custom match.

5162
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:13,600
They just took me out of the custom match.

5163
02:25:13,820 --> 02:25:14,940
They just... what?

5164
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:18,760
You bugged out.

5165
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:20,900
I kicked you out.

5166
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:22,420
They saw your TSM.

5167
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,780
Do we need to somehow get a DC restart in case we...

5168
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,900
What group are we?

5169
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:28,400
I don't know.

5170
02:25:28,760 --> 02:25:29,520
We are...

5171
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,620
Group 15.

5172
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:33,940
Alright, no, I'm just getting ready, just in case.

5173
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:38,740
Oh my god, we made it to round 2, guys.

5174
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:41,760
Alright, we're back to where we started last time, guys.

5175
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:43,460
We make it past this round.

5176
02:25:43,820 --> 02:25:45,220
We got 12 last...

5177
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:47,940
We got 12 last game.

5178
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:49,100
Last week.

5179
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:50,640
Alright, we're going for 7th.

5180
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:52,020
Yeah.

5181
02:25:52,220 --> 02:25:53,940
Look, I'd just be happy with top 10.

5182
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:55,860
I'm gonna be honest, bro.

5183
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:56,920
I'm happy with 9th place.

5184
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:57,820
I'm happy with 10th.

5185
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:58,500
I'm gonna be real.

5186
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,620
Like, just please.

5187
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:01,040
That's all we want.

5188
02:26:01,820 --> 02:26:03,160
Get me a school bus.

5189
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:04,240
Let's go.

5190
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:04,840
We got this shit.

5191
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:05,180
Easy.

5192
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:07,260
I believe in us guys fully.

5193
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:08,240
I believe.

5194
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,120
Chad, thank you all for being here and supporting.

5195
02:26:11,300 --> 02:26:11,760
Everybody's chat.

5196
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:13,600
Yeah, thank you everybody.

5197
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,120
We love you guys.

5198
02:26:15,320 --> 02:26:16,320
You get smaller ping.

5199
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:17,840
What?

5200
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:18,780
What did you just say?

5201
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:21,380
Smaller ping.

5202
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:23,560
Okay, now that's some fucking cope shit right there.

5203
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,120
There's no way that's true.

5204
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:26,720
There's no fucking way.

5205
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:36,460
We can do this.

5206
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:37,740
I believe.

5207
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:43,780
There's no way.

5208
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:47,400
There's no way we can't get past, like, top 10 this time around.

5209
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:49,800
I think this lobby's easier for sure.

5210
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:50,200
Yeah.

5211
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,160
Okay, but what happens if we...

5212
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:52,960
And we have Zeus.

5213
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:54,480
I mean, we have Lightning Rod.

5214
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:55,660
Okay, we run Storm Queen first.

5215
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:56,560
I'm gonna be honest.

5216
02:26:56,860 --> 02:26:58,460
How did we feel without Valk that game?

5217
02:26:58,580 --> 02:26:58,880
Okay.

5218
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:02,060
Yeah, we had a million evac hours.

5219
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:02,860
Yeah, okay, yeah.

5220
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:04,120
We'll just make sure we get our evacs.

5221
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:04,720
That's like the biggest thing.

5222
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:06,960
Yeah, so do we do bang then?

5223
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:08,680
Yeah, yeah.

5224
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:13,940
Wait, where does the beacon spawn in Lightning Rod?

5225
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:17,160
Wait, where does the beacon spawn in Lightning Rod?

5226
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:17,420
Um...

5227
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:18,940
Um...

5228
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:22,940
Like, we haven't had a single beacon yet in Lightning Rod.

5229
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:23,880
But...

5230
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:25,000
This is it.

5231
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:25,580
Round 2.

5232
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:32,200
If beacon spawns in Lightning Rod, one of you guys has to swap and go Thunderwatch.

5233
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:35,620
Because I gotta go to wherever the beacon is, right?

5234
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:36,140
Yeah.

5235
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:36,680
Yeah.

5236
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:38,360
Yeah, I can do that.

5237
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:40,520
I'll take over your place if we get the beacon.

5238
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:40,800
Okay.

5239
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,600
Alright, let's do this.

5240
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:45,060
Alright, I believe.

5241
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:46,440
Oh, there we go.

5242
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:46,880
I see it.

5243
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,440
It says TSM.

5244
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:48,460
Yeah!

5245
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:52,800
Guys, exclusive right now.

5246
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:56,900
We wanted to wait until now to announce it, but we got signed by TSM.

5247
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:58,120
Yep.

5248
02:27:58,120 --> 02:27:59,420
Three new content creators.

5249
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:01,040
Signed to TSM, guys.

5250
02:28:01,240 --> 02:28:04,100
Yeah, you know how like, how Temple was getting kicked out of his house?

5251
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:05,320
Wait, wait, wait.

5252
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:05,720
It's because...

5253
02:28:06,660 --> 02:28:09,260
It's because he's getting signed, so they're getting him a new house.

5254
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:10,420
As a content creator!

5255
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,220
You're so smart.

5256
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:12,820
You're so right.

5257
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:14,260
TSM Doki Bird!

5258
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:17,340
Let's go!

5259
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:20,920
TSM Doki sounds fire.

5260
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:22,920
I better see that in the competitive ring.

5261
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:24,880
Yeah, yeah.

5262
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:26,480
We better see this on Reddit.

5263
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:27,200
Yeah, yeah.

5264
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:29,580
I swear to God.

5265
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:32,440
I better see that.

5266
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:34,420
Wait, do we not have a beacon again?

5267
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:35,260
No, we don't.

5268
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:35,580
Okay.

5269
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:37,440
We don't, we don't.

5270
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:39,860
This is gonna sound crazy.

5271
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:41,060
Can we pass the Jump Master Tempo?

5272
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:41,880
Haha!

5273
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:43,620
Actually, no.

5274
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:44,700
He was really fucking good.

5275
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:47,020
Evan, get back here!

5276
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:47,820
Alright, wait.

5277
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:49,740
I'm gonna try to go and get the car on the right side.

5278
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:50,100
Okay?

5279
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:54,020
So, Doki, you go to the front of Lightning Rod, and I'll go from here and go to the back.

5280
02:28:54,100 --> 02:28:54,320
Okay.

5281
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:55,500
I'll loot here then.

5282
02:28:55,660 --> 02:28:58,560
Keep in mind, if someone just did not call...

5283
02:28:59,280 --> 02:28:59,600
Lightning Rod?

5284
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:00,420
Yeah.

5285
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:05,100
If someone's going Lightning Rod, we 100% just land Thunder Watch and we try to rotate out.

5286
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:05,560
Alright.

5287
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:07,420
But we have a good jump here.

5288
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:08,220
Should be pretty clean.

5289
02:29:08,400 --> 02:29:09,820
I don't think anyone's gonna be too crazy about it.

5290
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:10,180
We should be fine.

5291
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:10,860
Yay!

5292
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:14,240
As of right now, it looks like we are uncontested.

5293
02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:14,760
For sure.

5294
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:15,440
Really?

5295
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:16,660
As of right now, yes.

5296
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:17,000
It does.

5297
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:17,860
Oh?

5298
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:19,140
There's like 19...

5299
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:21,880
Lightning Rod?

5300
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:22,700
I think so.

5301
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:23,280
Yes, yes, yes.

5302
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:24,320
Where do I land?

5303
02:29:25,580 --> 02:29:27,140
Yeah, land on the watch side.

5304
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:29,020
Go Thunder.

5305
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:29,360
Go Thunder.

5306
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:29,780
Doki, back up.

5307
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:32,060
I'm gonna loot this building and I'll go to you guys.

5308
02:29:32,140 --> 02:29:32,480
Go Thunder.

5309
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:32,700
Okay.

5310
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:34,020
Did they take it?

5311
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:35,580
Yeah, they got it.

5312
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:35,840
They got it.

5313
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:37,080
That's fine.

5314
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:38,100
I'm just gonna run you guys immediately.

5315
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:39,220
I have my Carpide.

5316
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:39,900
I got some good loot.

5317
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:42,540
I stole some of their shit and we're gonna dip out.

5318
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:43,360
Charge Rifle.

5319
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:44,380
Nice.

5320
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:44,600
Okay.

5321
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:46,980
They're gonna maybe try to fight us here too, but let's just...

5322
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:47,720
try to keep on moving.

5323
02:29:47,820 --> 02:29:48,760
Did anyone go Storm?

5324
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:49,720
I didn't see at all.

5325
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:50,780
No one's Storm catching me.

5326
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:51,040
I have no idea.

5327
02:29:51,460 --> 02:29:51,780
Okay.

5328
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:52,920
My audio's not on.

5329
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:54,200
Okay, that's not good.

5330
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:54,940
Turn it right off.

5331
02:29:55,540 --> 02:29:56,740
Also, just be hyper aware.

5332
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:58,040
These kids could 100% push us.

5333
02:29:58,100 --> 02:29:58,280
Please.

5334
02:29:58,360 --> 02:29:59,620
I have a PK here.

5335
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:01,160
Okay, I'm good.

5336
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:01,940
I'm Lombo Havoc.

5337
02:30:01,980 --> 02:30:02,200
I'm okay.

5338
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:04,740
I'm okay too.

5339
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:07,000
Trust me, anyone went Storm, they did.

5340
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:07,760
Okay, there's a team Storm.

5341
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:09,040
These kids are lowkey fucking us here.

5342
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:09,320
But it's okay.

5343
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:10,280
That's what it is.

5344
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:12,260
Okay, I have good guns.

5345
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:14,080
I have Vault and Carpide.

5346
02:30:14,680 --> 02:30:16,860
Okay, what we're gonna do, I think then, we're gonna run to the left.

5347
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,020
Okay, we're gonna go left side over here.

5348
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:19,580
I'm ready to go whenever.

5349
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:21,260
Yeah, go left side over here.

5350
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:22,760
We're gonna go east side, southeast side.

5351
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:23,820
And we're gonna go get this car.

5352
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:25,760
They shouldn't shoot us, I don't think.

5353
02:30:27,360 --> 02:30:28,260
Yeah, hypothetically, right?

5354
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:29,380
Yeah, for sure.

5355
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:32,780
I'm gonna stick to the right side.

5356
02:30:33,420 --> 02:30:34,620
If they're here, then fuck them.

5357
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:35,040
We just kill them.

5358
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:35,440
Honestly.

5359
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:39,520
Or do we rat inside the compound and wait for one of their idiots?

5360
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:42,800
And then use the confusion tactic.

5361
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,940
And then use the confusion tactic.

5362
02:30:45,540 --> 02:30:46,700
No, it's just a car crash.

5363
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:49,720
Yeah.

5364
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:50,980
We need to stop cooking.

5365
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:52,740
Yeah, let's stop cooking.

5366
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:54,380
Let's get in this car and we're gonna go down to spiders.

5367
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:54,720
Okay.

5368
02:30:56,820 --> 02:30:57,460
I'm gonna rotate out.

5369
02:30:59,140 --> 02:30:59,920
Just get to me immediately.

5370
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:02,340
I'm here.

5371
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:04,400
When you honk, can other people hear the honk?

5372
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:05,100
Yes, of course.

5373
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:07,400
We're gonna leave this compound.

5374
02:31:07,860 --> 02:31:08,180
Okay.

5375
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:13,660
Let's just stick together though, because I don't know what this team's gonna do, if I'm being honest.

5376
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:15,520
I'm gonna grab the Evo.

5377
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:16,920
Yeah, go for it.

5378
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:23,280
Just keep your head on a swivel, just in case.

5379
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:23,920
Alright.

5380
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:24,520
Not last!

5381
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:26,040
What?

5382
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:26,780
Not last!

5383
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,360
Oh my god, you scared me.

5384
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:28,700
Not last!

5385
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:29,160
Let's go!

5386
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:29,660
We're good!

5387
02:31:30,440 --> 02:31:30,920
Yeah, we're good!

5388
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:32,480
Fucking losers!

5389
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:35,460
Not last!

5390
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:35,820
Okay.

5391
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,400
Did y'all loot this in here or no?

5392
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:44,100
I just looted the second floor.

5393
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:45,120
Okay, nice.

5394
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:47,440
I'm gonna go across the street and loot across.

5395
02:31:47,540 --> 02:31:50,860
Are we going down this spider's- Yeah, we're gonna take this ride though.

5396
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,100
We're gonna navigate with this car for sure.

5397
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:53,900
Well, I'm already gone.

5398
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:54,860
That's fine.

5399
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:55,920
I'm gonna try.

5400
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:56,920
I thought you were gonna loot across.

5401
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,520
I'm gonna be honest, we want to go for it.

5402
02:31:59,540 --> 02:31:59,900
I'll come with you.

5403
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,260
Tell me, don't go too far away from us.

5404
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:04,520
Okay.

5405
02:32:05,860 --> 02:32:09,000
There will be teams probably rotating out, and I want you to get shot at or just stormed.

5406
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:10,420
I'm gonna stay in the nuts.

5407
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:12,420
While I wait for your car.

5408
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:13,240
Yeah, yeah.

5409
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:15,740
Hang out with Wig.

5410
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:17,580
We're vibing, we're vibing.

5411
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:18,320
We're looking so good.

5412
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:19,700
So juicy.

5413
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,920
My loot's not honestly terrible for what the fuck we got.

5414
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,560
Yeah, I honestly feel like I have good loot.

5415
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:25,580
We just need another Evo.

5416
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:27,420
Or like an Assault Bin.

5417
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:29,740
We're gonna go find another Evo right now.

5418
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:31,800
Tempo, come in.

5419
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:33,580
Uber!

5420
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:34,820
Uber's here.

5421
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:39,800
Are we gonna do spiders?

5422
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:40,680
No.

5423
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:41,400
We're gonna grab the Evo.

5424
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:43,220
Yeah, we're gonna go get the Evo on the left side.

5425
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:45,620
Just stay in until I tell you guys to jump out, just in case.

5426
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:47,880
Let's go get this Evo though.

5427
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:50,480
Alright, someone get in there.

5428
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:50,780
Okay.

5429
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:53,020
Weeeeee!

5430
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:54,680
I got us!

5431
02:32:55,940 --> 02:32:56,580
Team play!

5432
02:32:58,480 --> 02:32:58,820
It's okay.

5433
02:32:59,000 --> 02:32:59,800
We're gonna come to the left side.

5434
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:01,840
I might pick the wrong one also.

5435
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:03,660
Wait, wait, wait.

5436
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:05,300
That's a lot of Ulti-Excells and stuff.

5437
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:05,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5438
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:07,060
Alright.

5439
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:09,280
I got Ulti-Excell and a Med Kit.

5440
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:09,660
We're good.

5441
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:11,980
Yeah, I'm gonna grab some.

5442
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:14,360
So guys, I might also pick the wrong one.

5443
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:15,160
That's okay.

5444
02:33:16,840 --> 02:33:18,440
Alright, we're gonna go now to launch.

5445
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:21,100
We're gonna go to Devastated and hit the beacon, okay?

5446
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:21,540
Alright.

5447
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:24,360
And we're gonna get the other Evo on this back left side.

5448
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:26,560
Alright.

5449
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:26,600
Okay.

5450
02:33:28,220 --> 02:33:29,460
Why is there an Evo here?

5451
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:31,320
I'm gonna be honest bro, I have no fucking idea.

5452
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:32,360
I don't think I've ever seen this one.

5453
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:34,040
Yeah, that's so fucking far.

5454
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:34,840
I'll grab it.

5455
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:36,300
Yeah, get it, get it.

5456
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:38,000
Yeah, I'm the Evo girl!

5457
02:33:38,820 --> 02:33:39,720
Yeah, you are.

5458
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:40,280
That's me!

5459
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:41,740
Let's go.

5460
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:42,900
I'm just checking the map real quick.

5461
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:43,460
Woah!

5462
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:45,700
It's fine.

5463
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:46,700
I'm healing.

5464
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:49,140
Let's get in here.

5465
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:51,000
And we're gonna try to get... actually, don't get out of here.

5466
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:52,340
We're gonna go in this one, okay?

5467
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:53,060
Alright.

5468
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:56,040
Let's just play from here right now.

5469
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:58,080
I have no idea where this zone is going because we have no beacon here, which sucks.

5470
02:33:58,740 --> 02:33:59,640
Let's just navigate our space.

5471
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:01,160
Let me know if we find a...

5472
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:03,620
a sniper scope.

5473
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:04,120
Yeah.

5474
02:34:05,580 --> 02:34:06,580
We're gonna take the height of this.

5475
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:07,820
So we're not gonna play inside here.

5476
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:08,440
We're gonna take the height.

5477
02:34:09,820 --> 02:34:10,140
Ooh.

5478
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:14,180
Just cause I don't know... I just don't know how many people are here.

5479
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:15,680
Or how many... where the zone is going.

5480
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:17,120
I want anyone to come and just feed on us.

5481
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,480
So if it does end here somewhere...

5482
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:19,600
I'm gonna craft real fast.

5483
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:20,760
Yeah, you're good.

5484
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:21,260
I'm gonna go top.

5485
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:22,260
Hopefully no one's up here and I die.

5486
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:23,100
We're good.

5487
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:23,920
There's no way.

5488
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:25,220
You're so healthy.

5489
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:26,560
I'm so healthy.

5490
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,480
I also got... I can look over you guys now too.

5491
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:29,980
Alright, I'm heading up.

5492
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:32,560
Woah!

5493
02:34:33,580 --> 02:34:34,480
There's a scope here!

5494
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:35,660
There's literally a scope in front of you.

5495
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:37,000
Yeah, I have a...

5496
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:37,500
Yeah.

5497
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:37,960
I'll grab that.

5498
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:38,780
I'll grab that.

5499
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:40,800
Okay, we're gonna set up here.

5500
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:41,880
Seems like they're rotating in this way.

5501
02:34:42,020 --> 02:34:43,620
I think it's going Paiwan to be honest, but I'm not sure.

5502
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:44,220
So we'll just play from here.

5503
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:45,660
We'll open their backs just in case.

5504
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:48,320
Yeah, you can do that.

5505
02:34:52,350 --> 02:34:53,150
Alright, you guys play up here.

5506
02:34:53,190 --> 02:34:54,270
I'm gonna go get these two bins up here.

5507
02:34:54,330 --> 02:34:55,190
Just in case there's any cells coming.

5508
02:34:55,830 --> 02:34:57,610
Where were you shooting?

5509
02:34:58,090 --> 02:34:58,470
Paiwan side.

5510
02:34:59,350 --> 02:35:00,050
Yeah, it was a team.

5511
02:35:00,110 --> 02:35:00,770
It was a team in Paiwan.

5512
02:35:01,330 --> 02:35:02,030
Looking behind us.

5513
02:35:02,130 --> 02:35:02,870
Yeah, they're fighting someone else.

5514
02:35:03,410 --> 02:35:03,770
That's good.

5515
02:35:04,190 --> 02:35:05,290
Just get shots down and go for it.

5516
02:35:06,110 --> 02:35:06,730
Oh, team here!

5517
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:07,330
Team here!

5518
02:35:08,050 --> 02:35:08,930
Okay, I'm gonna leave after this.

5519
02:35:08,930 --> 02:35:09,310
You can shoot at too.

5520
02:35:10,310 --> 02:35:10,670
Yeah, yeah.

5521
02:35:10,730 --> 02:35:11,450
I'm gonna leave right now.

5522
02:35:11,470 --> 02:35:12,390
I'm gonna go get these bins.

5523
02:35:13,210 --> 02:35:13,490
Nice.

5524
02:35:14,290 --> 02:35:15,650
He's behind that box.

5525
02:35:16,170 --> 02:35:17,070
Yeah, he's not peeking though.

5526
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:18,890
Like I said, there's a lot of people that are coming over here.

5527
02:35:18,950 --> 02:35:19,810
I think it might actually ender us.

5528
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:21,370
Should we be here then?

5529
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:22,830
There's an AR team fighting here.

5530
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:25,070
Yeah, we should definitely play hide if it's gonna end here.

5531
02:35:25,210 --> 02:35:25,570
For sure.

5532
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:26,930
We can evac hide if we need as well.

5533
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:27,650
It's a really good spot.

5534
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:30,150
I'm just trying to find a spot.

5535
02:35:30,170 --> 02:35:31,670
There's an AR team fighting here, Tempo.

5536
02:35:31,730 --> 02:35:32,230
You wanna shoot.

5537
02:35:33,470 --> 02:35:35,230
I'm gonna look behind us still.

5538
02:35:35,930 --> 02:35:37,850
Yeah, there's a team now walking into launch pad back side.

5539
02:35:37,910 --> 02:35:39,090
I think we're in a really good spot, guys.

5540
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:39,470
Alright.

5541
02:35:40,310 --> 02:35:41,330
This is our new home.

5542
02:35:41,470 --> 02:35:41,970
Oh no.

5543
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:46,870
I could 100%, 1 million, 1000% be wrong, but let's just check it out.

5544
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:47,690
We'll vibe out for now.

5545
02:35:51,490 --> 02:35:51,850
Wooo.

5546
02:35:54,390 --> 02:35:57,130
What happened to that team that was walking behind us?

5547
02:35:57,170 --> 02:35:58,050
I don't see them anymore.

5548
02:35:58,550 --> 02:35:58,910
Woah!

5549
02:36:00,450 --> 02:36:01,610
Oh, I see it.

5550
02:36:02,470 --> 02:36:03,710
Wait, landing behind us now too?

5551
02:36:03,990 --> 02:36:04,710
I need heal.

5552
02:36:05,330 --> 02:36:06,050
I'm gonna go to Phoenix.

5553
02:36:06,630 --> 02:36:07,250
I'm gonna be honest.

5554
02:36:07,330 --> 02:36:08,750
I'm not gonna peek until the next zone closes.

5555
02:36:09,170 --> 02:36:10,350
I think only Tempo should peek.

5556
02:36:11,470 --> 02:36:11,830
Yeah.

5557
02:36:12,190 --> 02:36:14,130
I stood on top of it.

5558
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:15,070
I almost glided in.

5559
02:36:17,270 --> 02:36:18,530
Wait, we're actually in such a good spot.

5560
02:36:18,630 --> 02:36:19,230
Look at our zone call.

5561
02:36:19,310 --> 02:36:19,790
Oh my god.

5562
02:36:20,550 --> 02:36:21,290
Look at this.

5563
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:22,590
Look at that.

5564
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:24,030
R-I-G-O right there.

5565
02:36:24,450 --> 02:36:25,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5566
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:25,570
That's our guy.

5567
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:27,190
I'm way more locked in this week.

5568
02:36:27,250 --> 02:36:27,670
I'm telling you.

5569
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:28,150
That's our guy.

5570
02:36:28,950 --> 02:36:29,450
That's me.

5571
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:29,810
That's me.

5572
02:36:30,390 --> 02:36:30,830
That's him.

5573
02:36:31,030 --> 02:36:32,890
C-Pod's affirmation works.

5574
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:36,990
Don't worry.

5575
02:36:37,330 --> 02:36:40,810
I'm not gonna peek too much because I don't really have that much good meds.

5576
02:36:40,830 --> 02:36:41,430
I have two.

5577
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:42,770
Two bats, nine...

5578
02:36:43,210 --> 02:36:46,270
I have two bats, uh, seven.

5579
02:36:46,590 --> 02:36:47,170
I'm too seven.

5580
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:47,710
Okay, Tempo.

5581
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:49,530
Can you get like one or two barrels out here?

5582
02:36:49,650 --> 02:36:51,330
If a team oobs us, just hit the barrels.

5583
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:52,610
There you go.

5584
02:36:53,150 --> 02:36:53,470
Yeah.

5585
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:57,490
Because I don't think we want to peek too much right now, but I want to show a little bit of presence if a team just oobs on us.

5586
02:36:57,610 --> 02:36:58,690
Oh, suck.

5587
02:37:00,450 --> 02:37:02,430
Alright, so here's the here's the game plan, guys.

5588
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:05,110
If a team oobs, just grenade spam.

5589
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:05,550
I just catch it.

5590
02:37:05,810 --> 02:37:06,130
Yes.

5591
02:37:06,130 --> 02:37:06,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5592
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,090
Grenade it.

5593
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:08,410
And I have an ulti-excel here.

5594
02:37:08,530 --> 02:37:09,150
Anyone needs it later.

5595
02:37:09,290 --> 02:37:09,530
Okay.

5596
02:37:10,250 --> 02:37:10,570
Alright.

5597
02:37:12,130 --> 02:37:13,630
Okay, we need six more teams to die.

5598
02:37:14,450 --> 02:37:16,610
Yeah, we're gonna we have one more, one more point.

5599
02:37:16,750 --> 02:37:17,670
I don't know where this point.

5600
02:37:18,130 --> 02:37:22,910
To any teams that are stream sniping, you want us to make it to the next round so you get content and clout.

5601
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:27,450
Also, also, also we're easier to kill, so it's like better to have us longer.

5602
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:31,710
Yeah, yeah, so you better have us longer in the lobby so you can get higher placement, just so you guys know.

5603
02:37:31,830 --> 02:37:32,210
You're so smart.

5604
02:37:32,290 --> 02:37:32,850
You're so smart.

5605
02:37:32,850 --> 02:37:32,950
Yeah, yeah.

5606
02:37:32,990 --> 02:37:35,530
So if you're stream sniping us at the moment, remember this.

5607
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:36,690
Yeah, remember everything.

5608
02:37:37,130 --> 02:37:37,770
Remember me.

5609
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:38,810
Remember us.

5610
02:37:38,810 --> 02:37:39,710
Remember how disappointed I'll be.

5611
02:37:39,810 --> 02:37:42,790
Remember, you'll become famous in our, for being in our lobbies.

5612
02:37:43,250 --> 02:37:43,690
Yup.

5613
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:44,770
This is gonna be your big break.

5614
02:37:46,530 --> 02:37:47,910
Your big break?

5615
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:50,450
Your big break is crazy!

5616
02:37:50,890 --> 02:37:51,930
Oh my god.

5617
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:55,410
This is your, this is your chance, guys.

5618
02:37:55,610 --> 02:37:56,570
This is your chance!

5619
02:37:56,710 --> 02:37:57,350
Let us in!

5620
02:37:58,010 --> 02:37:59,230
Stream snip us.

5621
02:37:59,650 --> 02:38:01,530
Just let us into round three.

5622
02:38:02,130 --> 02:38:03,190
You're gonna be famous.

5623
02:38:04,330 --> 02:38:06,410
I'm gonna shoot it with you.

5624
02:38:06,510 --> 02:38:07,870
We got any hits that'll be so funny.

5625
02:38:07,970 --> 02:38:08,270
I hit one.

5626
02:38:08,830 --> 02:38:10,910
I hit, I can't even see where you're hitting at.

5627
02:38:12,410 --> 02:38:16,650
They're rotating left, so I think I might pull a little more towards devastated, but we're in a really good spot with an evac tower here.

5628
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:16,890
Alright.

5629
02:38:17,810 --> 02:38:18,590
Yeah, they went into here.

5630
02:38:18,610 --> 02:38:18,910
Yeah, they went here.

5631
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:20,170
That's fine.

5632
02:38:20,290 --> 02:38:21,170
They're gonna hit the people's skin.

5633
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:21,830
I think that's what they want.

5634
02:38:22,050 --> 02:38:22,770
And the ring console.

5635
02:38:24,750 --> 02:38:25,950
I see them up here, yeah.

5636
02:38:27,430 --> 02:38:28,470
Yeah, they're right here now.

5637
02:38:29,130 --> 02:38:30,210
Oh, they're finding someone up there.

5638
02:38:30,210 --> 02:38:31,510
In 46 seconds, we'll find out.

5639
02:38:31,530 --> 02:38:32,630
Good, that's another team gone.

5640
02:38:34,570 --> 02:38:35,210
We need that.

5641
02:38:38,050 --> 02:38:41,510
Oh my god, someone else has a ca- Someone else has also a caustic with a charge rifle.

5642
02:38:44,950 --> 02:38:47,630
I miss it when you can have one person farm evil.

5643
02:38:48,450 --> 02:38:49,710
Now I actually have to try.

5644
02:38:51,630 --> 02:38:53,190
I think that's my least favorite part about it.

5645
02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:54,230
I was so useful back then.

5646
02:38:54,470 --> 02:38:56,470
Yeah, because you were the evil farmer.

5647
02:38:56,850 --> 02:38:58,090
Yeah, I was the one guy with the rifle.

5648
02:38:58,250 --> 02:38:59,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5649
02:39:00,010 --> 02:39:01,110
Give me your shields, guys.

5650
02:39:01,710 --> 02:39:02,410
What was it?

5651
02:39:02,410 --> 02:39:02,650
What did I say?

5652
02:39:02,650 --> 02:39:02,990
Wait for it.

5653
02:39:03,070 --> 02:39:03,690
I don't know.

5654
02:39:04,750 --> 02:39:05,070
Charge.

5655
02:39:06,110 --> 02:39:06,430
What?

5656
02:39:09,470 --> 02:39:10,270
Take some, bro.

5657
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:12,070
I think I actually understood what you were saying.

5658
02:39:12,190 --> 02:39:12,670
That's insane.

5659
02:39:12,850 --> 02:39:14,510
Yeah, I was like, what did he just say?

5660
02:39:15,050 --> 02:39:15,370
Exactly.

5661
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:17,270
That was unbelievable.

5662
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:20,130
It's probably because I speak mumbo jumbo, too.

5663
02:39:21,790 --> 02:39:22,890
We're in a really good spot.

5664
02:39:22,970 --> 02:39:23,750
We just play up here and we evac.

5665
02:39:24,390 --> 02:39:25,850
Yeah, we're valid.

5666
02:39:26,190 --> 02:39:27,210
How many evacs do we have?

5667
02:39:27,210 --> 02:39:27,490
You have one?

5668
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:28,030
Either one?

5669
02:39:28,130 --> 02:39:29,190
I have one.

5670
02:39:29,330 --> 02:39:29,910
We have two.

5671
02:39:29,930 --> 02:39:31,010
We have two evacs.

5672
02:39:31,270 --> 02:39:32,770
We're probably going to have to do a double evac.

5673
02:39:33,010 --> 02:39:33,870
So ours just gets shot at.

5674
02:39:34,290 --> 02:39:35,690
Team just went onto the bridge.

5675
02:39:36,190 --> 02:39:36,710
Okay, nice.

5676
02:39:40,970 --> 02:39:41,770
We're doing great right now.

5677
02:39:42,030 --> 02:39:42,950
I believe in you.

5678
02:39:43,930 --> 02:39:44,570
Yeah, we're valid.

5679
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:45,470
Oh, oh, oh.

5680
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:50,790
We're safe.

5681
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:51,810
We're so safe.

5682
02:39:53,030 --> 02:39:57,310
It would be funny if Temple got like three meds shot from that fight.

5683
02:39:57,310 --> 02:39:57,910
If he just not...

5684
02:39:59,730 --> 02:40:02,450
He booped me and then I got just triple swamped.

5685
02:40:02,450 --> 02:40:02,630
Yeah.

5686
02:40:03,990 --> 02:40:04,630
Keep flying.

5687
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:04,950
Keep flying.

5688
02:40:05,010 --> 02:40:05,250
My U-Bus.

5689
02:40:05,290 --> 02:40:05,610
My U-Bus.

5690
02:40:06,050 --> 02:40:06,330
Hey.

5691
02:40:07,090 --> 02:40:07,590
They're above us.

5692
02:40:07,670 --> 02:40:07,930
They're above us.

5693
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:08,330
You gotta come here.

5694
02:40:08,370 --> 02:40:09,270
I have a nade ready.

5695
02:40:09,530 --> 02:40:10,150
Oh, shit.

5696
02:40:10,450 --> 02:40:14,570
I think they landed on our right.

5697
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:15,110
I don't think they ubed us.

5698
02:40:15,150 --> 02:40:15,650
Okay, okay.

5699
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:17,030
It sounded very scary though.

5700
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:18,610
Yeah, I looked up and I got shot.

5701
02:40:20,710 --> 02:40:22,130
Why did I get shot?

5702
02:40:22,270 --> 02:40:22,930
What the fuck?

5703
02:40:25,390 --> 02:40:26,550
It was my bad.

5704
02:40:27,710 --> 02:40:28,770
Where did they land?

5705
02:40:29,730 --> 02:40:29,930
I'm not sure.

5706
02:40:30,090 --> 02:40:31,150
I think they landed underneath the reds.

5707
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:31,630
I gotta scan right now.

5708
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:31,990
Yeah, scan.

5709
02:40:33,450 --> 02:40:34,090
What's red room?

5710
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:35,950
It's like between the toes.

5711
02:40:38,450 --> 02:40:39,390
Little red rooms.

5712
02:40:39,570 --> 02:40:39,870
I'm sad.

5713
02:40:40,110 --> 02:40:42,110
I can't be helpful because I only have a carbine.

5714
02:40:42,530 --> 02:40:42,990
It's okay.

5715
02:40:43,250 --> 02:40:44,170
I'm not really doing much either.

5716
02:40:44,270 --> 02:40:46,750
I don't have enough heals for us to do any shit like that anyway.

5717
02:40:47,850 --> 02:40:48,210
I'm not really doing much either.

5718
02:40:48,210 --> 02:40:48,210
I don't have enough heals for us to do any shit like that anyway.

5719
02:40:48,210 --> 02:40:49,770
We're doing pretty good for not...

5720
02:40:49,770 --> 02:40:50,990
We're doing pretty good for not...

5721
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:53,290
For having like a contested drop?

5722
02:40:53,610 --> 02:40:56,150
And also just having to farm evos early with a trident.

5723
02:40:56,230 --> 02:40:56,710
What the fuck?

5724
02:40:56,710 --> 02:40:58,290
There are two solos that just died.

5725
02:40:58,290 --> 02:40:58,990
What the fuck?

5726
02:40:59,430 --> 02:41:00,350
I got shot from the left side.

5727
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:01,690
Three more teams.

5728
02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:02,190
Three more teams.

5729
02:41:02,830 --> 02:41:03,430
Yeah, we're good.

5730
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:03,630
We're good.

5731
02:41:04,030 --> 02:41:04,750
Tembo, can you do me a favor?

5732
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:06,530
Can you move this barrel up like right here?

5733
02:41:07,350 --> 02:41:08,670
Move it up just a little bit.

5734
02:41:08,730 --> 02:41:09,370
Yeah, the middle one.

5735
02:41:09,430 --> 02:41:09,910
Yeah, so I can play.

5736
02:41:09,970 --> 02:41:11,730
If someone oobs us or comes up here, I can just play it.

5737
02:41:11,770 --> 02:41:12,930
What does oob mean?

5738
02:41:13,810 --> 02:41:14,370
Out of bounds.

5739
02:41:14,590 --> 02:41:15,790
So I can land out of bounds and land on you.

5740
02:41:15,870 --> 02:41:15,930
Oh.

5741
02:41:17,410 --> 02:41:18,450
Wait, they're fighting on the left.

5742
02:41:18,630 --> 02:41:19,070
Shoot this.

5743
02:41:19,130 --> 02:41:19,290
Shoot this.

5744
02:41:19,510 --> 02:41:19,610
Shoot this.

5745
02:41:19,610 --> 02:41:19,830
Shoot this.

5746
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:20,270
Shoot this.

5747
02:41:20,490 --> 02:41:21,090
I'm gonna get shot.

5748
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:24,210
Oh, motherfucker faded in.

5749
02:41:24,210 --> 02:41:24,670
I hit ten.

5750
02:41:25,010 --> 02:41:25,930
I got ten damage.

5751
02:41:26,530 --> 02:41:26,810
Nice.

5752
02:41:26,810 --> 02:41:27,270
Good ten damage.

5753
02:41:28,890 --> 02:41:29,510
So huge.

5754
02:41:29,530 --> 02:41:30,010
So huge.

5755
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:30,510
I'm contributing.

5756
02:41:31,230 --> 02:41:31,670
Nice.

5757
02:41:31,730 --> 02:41:32,590
And then you just took four hundred?

5758
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:33,070
Yeah.

5759
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:35,650
A team landed close.

5760
02:41:36,010 --> 02:41:36,570
Yeah, we're good.

5761
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:36,870
We're good.

5762
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:37,730
We're good.

5763
02:41:37,730 --> 02:41:37,810
We're good.

5764
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:39,070
We're good.

5765
02:41:39,430 --> 02:41:41,430
Dude, why are you shooting us, you fucking bums?

5766
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:41,810
Sorry.

5767
02:41:42,510 --> 02:41:42,950
Yeah.

5768
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:43,170
Yeah.

5769
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:44,210
Say it.

5770
02:41:44,290 --> 02:41:45,130
Say your feelings.

5771
02:41:45,630 --> 02:41:46,590
Say your feelings.

5772
02:41:46,590 --> 02:41:47,170
Say your feelings.

5773
02:41:47,230 --> 02:41:47,230
Say your feelings.

5774
02:41:47,230 --> 02:41:49,590
You're gonna explode if you don't.

5775
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:50,310
Yeah, you don't.

5776
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:53,390
Ducky's trying to give me another clip on Twitter.

5777
02:41:54,530 --> 02:41:57,330
Bro, any publicity is all about publicity.

5778
02:41:57,410 --> 02:41:57,470
Bro, any publicity is all about publicity.

5779
02:41:57,470 --> 02:41:58,030
It's good publicity.

5780
02:41:58,030 --> 02:41:58,270
Oh, I'm sorry.

5781
02:41:58,290 --> 02:41:58,770
Oh, my zone.

5782
02:41:58,990 --> 02:41:59,810
Okay, it's really bad.

5783
02:41:59,930 --> 02:42:00,790
Oh, that's bad for us.

5784
02:42:00,990 --> 02:42:01,270
Yeah.

5785
02:42:01,550 --> 02:42:02,350
It's a really bad zone.

5786
02:42:02,470 --> 02:42:03,150
Okay, we're gonna evac late.

5787
02:42:03,250 --> 02:42:03,850
Okay, that's all we're gonna do.

5788
02:42:03,930 --> 02:42:04,210
Okay.

5789
02:42:05,250 --> 02:42:05,610
It's fine.

5790
02:42:06,170 --> 02:42:06,690
It's fine.

5791
02:42:06,810 --> 02:42:07,450
Is it a building?

5792
02:42:08,370 --> 02:42:09,730
No, we're gonna evac from the top.

5793
02:42:09,770 --> 02:42:10,510
I don't know where we're landing.

5794
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:11,210
I have no idea yet.

5795
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:11,730
We have to check this out.

5796
02:42:11,830 --> 02:42:12,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5797
02:42:12,110 --> 02:42:13,450
We can, we can evac and do...

5798
02:42:13,970 --> 02:42:16,290
No, what we're probably gonna do is land from the staircase in the back over here.

5799
02:42:16,450 --> 02:42:16,710
Alright.

5800
02:42:17,370 --> 02:42:18,190
If we can make it that way.

5801
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:18,610
We'll see.

5802
02:42:18,630 --> 02:42:19,710
We'll see if we can get the evac off.

5803
02:42:19,890 --> 02:42:20,790
We're gonna go very late though.

5804
02:42:22,990 --> 02:42:25,250
We want other teams to die first before we start rotating in on this.

5805
02:42:25,250 --> 02:42:26,370
And other teams get focused.

5806
02:42:26,390 --> 02:42:28,450
Because if we just go early, our evacs can get absolutely rocked.

5807
02:42:28,510 --> 02:42:28,590
Yeah.

5808
02:42:28,770 --> 02:42:31,190
I feel like everyone's gonna shoot our evacs at that point.

5809
02:42:31,730 --> 02:42:32,270
Yeah, 100%.

5810
02:42:32,270 --> 02:42:34,770
We need this team on the left to like start moving up and stuff like that before we get rocked.

5811
02:42:34,870 --> 02:42:36,550
How much sniper ammo do you have, Temple?

5812
02:42:36,630 --> 02:42:37,870
You've been charge rifling forever.

5813
02:42:38,350 --> 02:42:38,550
12.

5814
02:42:38,910 --> 02:42:39,390
12 more.

5815
02:42:39,630 --> 02:42:40,170
Oh, okay.

5816
02:42:40,270 --> 02:42:40,810
That's not a lot.

5817
02:42:41,070 --> 02:42:45,090
Make sure full HP... Towards the end of like 20 seconds till the zone closes in, make sure you guys have full HP, please.

5818
02:42:45,170 --> 02:42:45,470
Okay, okay.

5819
02:42:46,390 --> 02:42:46,850
I'll try.

5820
02:42:49,650 --> 02:42:50,790
Alright, a couple evacs already coming out.

5821
02:42:50,970 --> 02:42:52,290
Alright, so you see my plane over here, guys?

5822
02:42:52,370 --> 02:42:52,490
Yeah.

5823
02:42:52,490 --> 02:42:52,970
Over on Devastated?

5824
02:42:53,030 --> 02:42:53,450
This plane right here.

5825
02:42:53,530 --> 02:42:55,070
We're gonna land from those staircases probably, okay?

5826
02:42:55,250 --> 02:42:55,530
Okay, okay.

5827
02:42:55,850 --> 02:42:56,610
Back side of it.

5828
02:42:56,650 --> 02:42:57,290
All the way in the back.

5829
02:42:57,310 --> 02:42:57,530
You spam ping us.

5830
02:42:57,630 --> 02:42:58,630
Spam ping us when you're ready.

5831
02:42:58,990 --> 02:42:59,770
We're gonna go late again.

5832
02:42:59,850 --> 02:43:00,170
We're gonna go late.

5833
02:43:01,650 --> 02:43:03,750
We need these kids on the left to fuck off, bro.

5834
02:43:03,850 --> 02:43:04,310
Like, leave.

5835
02:43:04,570 --> 02:43:05,470
What are they looking at?

5836
02:43:05,930 --> 02:43:07,410
I don't know why they're staring at us so hard.

5837
02:43:07,610 --> 02:43:08,670
Why are they staring at us?

5838
02:43:08,690 --> 02:43:09,190
Are we like...

5839
02:43:09,190 --> 02:43:09,970
Do they know it's us?

5840
02:43:10,210 --> 02:43:10,490
I don't know.

5841
02:43:10,490 --> 02:43:11,350
Do they have sniped us correctly?

5842
02:43:12,590 --> 02:43:13,330
Maybe, honestly.

5843
02:43:13,470 --> 02:43:14,350
Who the fuck knows at this point?

5844
02:43:14,590 --> 02:43:16,770
Like, is it 10 minutes past and they know we're here?

5845
02:43:16,890 --> 02:43:17,410
I have fallen.

5846
02:43:17,530 --> 02:43:19,070
Bro, what the fuck is wrong with...

5847
02:43:19,070 --> 02:43:20,610
Alright, you're gonna smoke this height, I think, Doki.

5848
02:43:20,730 --> 02:43:21,430
You're gonna smoke these guys.

5849
02:43:21,490 --> 02:43:21,670
Okay, okay.

5850
02:43:21,670 --> 02:43:21,670
Now?

5851
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:23,670
No, wait like five more seconds.

5852
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:24,850
Okay, let Kyle for it.

5853
02:43:25,190 --> 02:43:25,650
I will.

5854
02:43:25,710 --> 02:43:26,090
I will let you know.

5855
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:28,250
Oh, they smoked us.

5856
02:43:28,450 --> 02:43:28,670
Nice.

5857
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:29,190
Okay.

5858
02:43:29,410 --> 02:43:29,850
Alright, ready?

5859
02:43:29,890 --> 02:43:30,090
We're gonna go.

5860
02:43:30,210 --> 02:43:30,570
Come on, come on, come on.

5861
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:31,610
Come on, come on.

5862
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:33,110
Here's another one.

5863
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:34,030
I can't put the other one.

5864
02:43:34,670 --> 02:43:35,050
That's fine.

5865
02:43:35,090 --> 02:43:36,150
I'm gonna ult these two and land the other ult.

5866
02:43:36,150 --> 02:43:36,550
We're good, we're good.

5867
02:43:36,630 --> 02:43:36,970
We're good, we're good.

5868
02:43:38,750 --> 02:43:40,330
Just follow my pattern, okay?

5869
02:43:40,350 --> 02:43:40,870
Just follow my pattern.

5870
02:43:41,290 --> 02:43:41,850
Just follow me.

5871
02:43:42,390 --> 02:43:43,130
Stay up height.

5872
02:43:43,370 --> 02:43:43,810
Stay on height.

5873
02:43:43,890 --> 02:43:44,230
Stay on height.

5874
02:43:44,430 --> 02:43:45,270
As high as possible.

5875
02:43:45,370 --> 02:43:46,750
Oh, there's a team right above us, by the way.

5876
02:43:46,830 --> 02:43:47,550
We're fine, we're fine.

5877
02:43:47,650 --> 02:43:47,930
Just come here.

5878
02:43:48,030 --> 02:43:48,290
Yeah.

5879
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:49,810
We're gonna land right here on silo.

5880
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:50,350
Okay?

5881
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:50,850
We'll land right here.

5882
02:43:51,610 --> 02:43:52,710
Come here, come here, come here.

5883
02:43:52,810 --> 02:43:53,130
I got it.

5884
02:43:53,130 --> 02:43:54,050
Not to me, we're good.

5885
02:43:54,670 --> 02:43:55,590
What the fuck?

5886
02:43:55,890 --> 02:43:57,170
He's off on someone's head.

5887
02:43:57,410 --> 02:43:58,050
Wait, what?

5888
02:43:58,210 --> 02:43:59,510
Who the fuck is this guy?

5889
02:44:00,870 --> 02:44:01,490
Wait, Tommy!

5890
02:44:02,710 --> 02:44:04,290
Don't keep shooting the corners, to the corners, to the corners!

5891
02:44:04,510 --> 02:44:05,790
I couldn't, the other team shot me.

5892
02:44:05,830 --> 02:44:06,550
I got two kills.

5893
02:44:07,270 --> 02:44:08,690
I killed two friends.

5894
02:44:08,790 --> 02:44:09,310
I killed two friends.

5895
02:44:09,970 --> 02:44:10,830
What the fuck?

5896
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:11,930
Where did those guys go?

5897
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:12,990
Did you guys see those guys?

5898
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:14,630
No, I saw you got punched.

5899
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:15,570
I was like, who is that?

5900
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:17,710
Wait, what just happened?

5901
02:44:18,070 --> 02:44:18,910
Who the fuck was that?

5902
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:20,310
It's okay.

5903
02:44:20,850 --> 02:44:23,110
I killed a rank 56 friend.

5904
02:44:23,490 --> 02:44:26,430
What the fuck was that?

5905
02:44:27,350 --> 02:44:28,070
Oh, wait, no.

5906
02:44:28,330 --> 02:44:29,490
What the fuck?

5907
02:44:30,030 --> 02:44:31,870
I didn't see anyone there at all.

5908
02:44:32,310 --> 02:44:35,030
Was that the team that evac'd with us?

5909
02:44:35,130 --> 02:44:36,150
I don't know, but...

5910
02:44:36,850 --> 02:44:37,910
I just got punched.

5911
02:44:38,030 --> 02:44:38,830
I didn't hear a thing.

5912
02:44:38,990 --> 02:44:41,250
I didn't hear a... Oh, JK, I didn't kill a friend.

5913
02:44:41,330 --> 02:44:42,510
It was some other fucking...

5914
02:44:43,050 --> 02:44:44,950
Some fucking 4k shitter.

5915
02:44:44,990 --> 02:44:45,850
I don't know who they are.

5916
02:44:46,470 --> 02:44:46,950
Hello?

5917
02:44:48,310 --> 02:44:49,030
4k shitter.

5918
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:52,590
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5919
02:44:52,850 --> 02:44:53,210
I like, lost.

5920
02:44:53,210 --> 02:44:54,290
I didn't watch that pod back.

5921
02:44:54,570 --> 02:44:54,890
Me too.

5922
02:44:54,890 --> 02:44:57,130
You said someone landed storm, right?

5923
02:44:57,790 --> 02:44:58,150
Yeah.

5924
02:44:59,310 --> 02:44:59,670
Okay.

5925
02:44:59,670 --> 02:45:04,550
So right now we've got pylon, down beast, and command that we might be able to land at.

5926
02:45:04,770 --> 02:45:06,930
Command's not bad, because we can evac out of there if we need to.

5927
02:45:07,510 --> 02:45:10,090
Okay, do we want to just aim for command then for this one?

5928
02:45:10,150 --> 02:45:10,670
Yeah, I'm down.

5929
02:45:11,470 --> 02:45:13,530
I still don't know where they came from.

5930
02:45:13,590 --> 02:45:14,730
I'm so lost.

5931
02:45:14,730 --> 02:45:16,250
I was so confused when you got punched.

5932
02:45:16,250 --> 02:45:16,790
I had no audio.

5933
02:45:16,890 --> 02:45:18,710
And I was like, that's not tempo.

5934
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:20,990
I was like, that's a rampart.

5935
02:45:22,090 --> 02:45:23,110
That makes no sense.

5936
02:45:23,190 --> 02:45:25,250
I'm so confused as to what the fuck just happened to me.

5937
02:45:25,710 --> 02:45:26,310
Me too.

5938
02:45:27,610 --> 02:45:27,970
B3.

5939
02:45:28,030 --> 02:45:28,730
That was so weird.

5940
02:45:29,510 --> 02:45:31,330
Because they definitely were not there when we landed.

5941
02:45:31,450 --> 02:45:32,490
They were 100% not there.

5942
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:33,430
Yeah, there was nobody there.

5943
02:45:33,530 --> 02:45:36,430
They landed the moment we, like, landed, I think.

5944
02:45:36,650 --> 02:45:39,010
That's so shit too, because that's so fucking winnable.

5945
02:45:39,130 --> 02:45:44,230
We actually, we might have got sent on by this team inside, but we got absolutely sent on because of that team landing on us.

5946
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:44,450
Yeah.

5947
02:45:44,470 --> 02:45:44,710
That's so shit.

5948
02:45:44,730 --> 02:45:44,950
Shut up.

5949
02:45:45,970 --> 02:45:46,850
That was crazy.

5950
02:45:47,130 --> 02:45:49,150
There was no way I could live as a rat, too.

5951
02:45:50,050 --> 02:45:54,550
You guys got us four points when we would have gotten one.

5952
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:56,110
Yeah, let's go!

5953
02:45:57,090 --> 02:45:57,810
I contributed.

5954
02:45:58,530 --> 02:45:59,690
No, you did more than contribute.

5955
02:45:59,870 --> 02:46:00,470
You carried good shit.

5956
02:46:00,570 --> 02:46:02,050
That's just insane.

5957
02:46:02,370 --> 02:46:03,410
I cannot believe that just happened to me.

5958
02:46:03,490 --> 02:46:03,750
I know.

5959
02:46:03,870 --> 02:46:04,790
I was like, what the fuck.

5960
02:46:05,270 --> 02:46:06,370
I was like, where did they come from?

5961
02:46:07,050 --> 02:46:09,450
Getting punched was like the least expected way to die in that situation.

5962
02:46:09,890 --> 02:46:10,250
Yes!

5963
02:46:11,310 --> 02:46:13,510
They literally teleported into us.

5964
02:46:13,650 --> 02:46:15,310
I think they were just That's the surprise.

5965
02:46:15,530 --> 02:46:15,910
He's like...

5966
02:46:15,910 --> 02:46:16,550
I think the two.

5967
02:46:16,730 --> 02:46:17,350
Yeah, they're like...

5968
02:46:17,350 --> 02:46:18,430
Because they started punching.

5969
02:46:18,590 --> 02:46:20,290
They didn't even get their guns out.

5970
02:46:20,570 --> 02:46:21,710
How did you get two kills?

5971
02:46:22,110 --> 02:46:23,430
Wait, if they were punching, yeah.

5972
02:46:23,490 --> 02:46:25,350
Then they must have landed right when we landed.

5973
02:46:25,430 --> 02:46:25,630
Yeah.

5974
02:46:25,630 --> 02:46:26,370
I knew it.

5975
02:46:26,390 --> 02:46:26,710
I knew it.

5976
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:27,590
I knew it.

5977
02:46:28,390 --> 02:46:32,690
Because like when Wig was getting shot at, I got one down and then the other guy...

5978
02:46:32,690 --> 02:46:33,930
I don't know why he didn't...

5979
02:46:33,930 --> 02:46:36,170
I mean, he shot at me, but he lost the 1v1.

5980
02:46:36,470 --> 02:46:37,230
Yeah, I know.

5981
02:46:37,330 --> 02:46:39,270
He got... It's still kind of embarrassing that losing that too.

5982
02:46:39,310 --> 02:46:39,750
Yeah, that was...

5983
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:41,290
He definitely lost the 1v1.

5984
02:46:41,290 --> 02:46:41,870
They kind of goaded.

5985
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:42,830
They kind of goaded.

5986
02:46:47,050 --> 02:46:47,970
Oh my god.

5987
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:49,270
Wow, they got...

5988
02:46:49,270 --> 02:46:51,410
The team I'm watching right now is going to win.

5989
02:46:51,510 --> 02:46:52,530
They're just farming everyone.

5990
02:46:52,650 --> 02:46:53,250
Yeah, GG.

5991
02:46:53,550 --> 02:46:54,430
That's the farmers.

5992
02:46:58,450 --> 02:46:59,230
Oh my god.

5993
02:46:59,350 --> 02:47:00,510
Alright, I need to fucking pee so bad.

5994
02:47:00,570 --> 02:47:00,790
I'll be back.

5995
02:47:00,970 --> 02:47:01,150
Alright.

5996
02:47:01,430 --> 02:47:01,790
GG.

5997
02:47:01,970 --> 02:47:02,330
GG.

5998
02:47:02,750 --> 02:47:03,390
Got 10.

5999
02:47:03,810 --> 02:47:04,810
That's better than...

6000
02:47:04,810 --> 02:47:05,190
No, I...

6001
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:06,150
Dude, good kills.

6002
02:47:06,330 --> 02:47:07,450
Seriously, really good kills.

6003
02:47:07,570 --> 02:47:08,930
Those four points are going to be huge for us.

6004
02:47:09,130 --> 02:47:09,490
Yeah.

6005
02:47:09,490 --> 02:47:11,030
Those two points were going to...

6006
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:13,150
If we get like four or five points every game, then we qualify.

6007
02:47:13,270 --> 02:47:13,770
Yeah, we're good.

6008
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:14,090
I'm going to pee.

6009
02:47:14,310 --> 02:47:14,570
Alright.

6010
02:47:14,570 --> 02:47:14,770
Alright.

6011
02:47:15,250 --> 02:47:16,170
We're going to do this.

6012
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:19,290
Wait, I don't even know where you landed, Teppo.

6013
02:47:19,490 --> 02:47:20,130
We just need to pee.

6014
02:47:20,170 --> 02:47:21,890
I landed on top of the...

6015
02:47:22,470 --> 02:47:23,350
The silo thing.

6016
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:24,570
Yeah, and then you got shot down.

6017
02:47:24,570 --> 02:47:25,010
And then I...

6018
02:47:25,010 --> 02:47:26,350
I landed on top of it.

6019
02:47:26,350 --> 02:47:28,010
Then I got shot as I was jumping down.

6020
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:28,770
And then...

6021
02:47:29,270 --> 02:47:29,710
Yeah.

6022
02:47:29,790 --> 02:47:30,830
And then I died.

6023
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:31,490
Yeah.

6024
02:47:32,510 --> 02:47:33,670
And then I died.

6025
02:47:33,730 --> 02:47:34,950
And then you disappeared.

6026
02:47:35,670 --> 02:47:36,110
Yeah.

6027
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:38,030
Holy shit.

6028
02:47:38,070 --> 02:47:39,050
That was fucking crazy.

6029
02:47:39,050 --> 02:47:40,810
Oh, we are in ninth.

6030
02:47:41,610 --> 02:47:42,290
We're in ninth?

6031
02:47:42,310 --> 02:47:42,810
Let's go.

6032
02:47:43,430 --> 02:47:43,870
We're in ninth.

6033
02:47:43,870 --> 02:47:43,950
Yeah.

6034
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:50,550
If you didn't get us those two kills and the placement, we would be tied for 13th.

6035
02:47:50,970 --> 02:47:51,570
That's good.

6036
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:52,590
We got ninth place.

6037
02:47:52,710 --> 02:47:53,450
That was good.

6038
02:47:53,650 --> 02:47:53,790
We're gaming.

6039
02:47:54,690 --> 02:47:55,530
We're gamers.

6040
02:47:56,050 --> 02:47:56,510
Gamers.

6041
02:47:56,510 --> 02:47:56,930
Gamers gaming.

6042
02:47:58,030 --> 02:47:58,950
Eleven kills.

6043
02:47:59,170 --> 02:47:59,570
Okay.

6044
02:48:00,610 --> 02:48:01,750
We're doing so well.

6045
02:48:02,010 --> 02:48:02,790
I knew it.

6046
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:03,630
I knew we were gaming.

6047
02:48:03,670 --> 02:48:04,390
We're on track.

6048
02:48:08,590 --> 02:48:10,470
We're on track.

6049
02:48:10,470 --> 02:48:11,290
We're on track.

6050
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:15,030
We're on track to qualify for round three.

6051
02:48:15,070 --> 02:48:16,150
I've always believed in us.

6052
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:16,830
Look, Tempo.

6053
02:48:16,970 --> 02:48:24,890
Tempo, if we make it to round three, I will give you enough money for a third lunch.

6054
02:48:25,770 --> 02:48:27,010
Oh my god.

6055
02:48:27,530 --> 02:48:29,570
I'm making lunch and we're calling.

6056
02:48:31,270 --> 02:48:33,430
We made it out of round one.

6057
02:48:33,450 --> 02:48:34,270
Now we make it out of round two.

6058
02:48:34,270 --> 02:48:38,810
When we make it out of round two, you'll get lunches for all of LAN.

6059
02:48:39,130 --> 02:48:39,810
All right.

6060
02:48:39,810 --> 02:48:40,110
Deal.

6061
02:48:40,290 --> 02:48:42,150
How many LAN days are there?

6062
02:48:42,230 --> 02:48:42,490
Three?

6063
02:48:42,770 --> 02:48:43,430
Seven days.

6064
02:48:43,610 --> 02:48:44,010
Seven days?

6065
02:48:44,010 --> 02:48:44,410
Okay.

6066
02:48:44,590 --> 02:48:44,970
Third.

6067
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:46,070
I'll give you third.

6068
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:47,110
It's seven days long.

6069
02:48:47,390 --> 02:48:48,530
I'll give you third lunch.

6070
02:48:48,710 --> 02:48:49,530
Day three lunch.

6071
02:48:49,810 --> 02:48:52,450
And Wake will be in charge of day one and day two.

6072
02:48:52,510 --> 02:48:54,110
I'll be in charge of day three.

6073
02:48:54,450 --> 02:48:55,810
If we make it to...

6074
02:48:55,810 --> 02:48:56,030
All right.

6075
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:56,670
I'm back, guys.

6076
02:48:56,810 --> 02:48:57,490
I urinated.

6077
02:48:57,710 --> 02:48:57,930
Yeah.

6078
02:48:58,030 --> 02:48:58,330
Wait.

6079
02:48:58,430 --> 02:48:59,070
We made a deal.

6080
02:48:59,910 --> 02:49:00,730
We're in ninth.

6081
02:49:00,750 --> 02:49:01,290
We're in ninth.

6082
02:49:01,570 --> 02:49:07,270
If we make it past round two, I'll buy day three of LAN lunch for Tempo.

6083
02:49:07,370 --> 02:49:07,490
Wait.

6084
02:49:07,490 --> 02:49:08,070
Are you going to LAN?

6085
02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:08,410
No.

6086
02:49:08,610 --> 02:49:09,930
I'm just going to send him money.

6087
02:49:10,290 --> 02:49:10,570
Oh.

6088
02:49:13,210 --> 02:49:15,410
It would be a way cooler deal if you were actually there.

6089
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:15,530
If you were there.

6090
02:49:15,590 --> 02:49:15,850
Yeah.

6091
02:49:16,050 --> 02:49:16,330
Yeah.

6092
02:49:16,330 --> 02:49:16,450
Exactly.

6093
02:49:16,530 --> 02:49:18,050
If we make it to the finals.

6094
02:49:19,570 --> 02:49:20,970
If we make it to the finals, you go to LAN?

6095
02:49:21,350 --> 02:49:21,630
Yeah.

6096
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:22,430
We go to LAN.

6097
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:26,470
If we make it to the finals.

6098
02:49:28,170 --> 02:49:28,690
Oh, man.

6099
02:49:28,810 --> 02:49:28,970
Okay.

6100
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:29,290
Deal.

6101
02:49:29,390 --> 02:49:29,930
We'll do it then.

6102
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:30,730
We'll win this one.

6103
02:49:30,810 --> 02:49:31,070
Wait.

6104
02:49:31,150 --> 02:49:31,950
The code's not up, though.

6105
02:49:31,970 --> 02:49:32,190
No.

6106
02:49:32,190 --> 02:49:32,670
It's not up.

6107
02:49:32,730 --> 02:49:32,850
Yeah.

6108
02:49:32,910 --> 02:49:33,450
We're just waiting.

6109
02:49:33,610 --> 02:49:33,710
Yeah.

6110
02:49:33,710 --> 02:49:33,890
It is.

6111
02:49:33,890 --> 02:49:34,350
I just posted.

6112
02:49:34,510 --> 02:49:34,550
Oh, it is.

6113
02:49:34,550 --> 02:49:34,970
Oh, never mind.

6114
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:35,750
It just got out.

6115
02:49:35,810 --> 02:49:37,070
I just put the code in.

6116
02:49:37,070 --> 02:49:37,430
It didn't go.

6117
02:49:37,490 --> 02:49:37,830
Oh, never mind.

6118
02:49:37,890 --> 02:49:38,170
It went there.

6119
02:49:38,870 --> 02:49:39,610
Hey, I'm here.

6120
02:49:40,910 --> 02:49:45,650
Bro, what team landed on us at Devastated?

6121
02:49:45,810 --> 02:49:46,510
No, no, no way.

6122
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:46,830
No way.

6123
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:48,210
Who landed Syphon?

6124
02:49:48,270 --> 02:49:48,810
Who landed?

6125
02:49:48,930 --> 02:49:49,110
No way.

6126
02:49:49,190 --> 02:49:49,790
That was Syphon.

6127
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:51,070
Elrond.

6128
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:53,090
Banned from any events.

6129
02:49:53,670 --> 02:49:54,270
That's insane.

6130
02:49:55,710 --> 02:49:56,730
You're the GOAT for that, bro.

6131
02:49:57,750 --> 02:49:58,810
I'll call a water jug one second.

6132
02:50:01,230 --> 02:50:01,530
No.

6133
02:50:03,490 --> 02:50:06,350
Actually, speaking of which, you know that, you know how there was a...

6134
02:50:06,750 --> 02:50:07,050
I don't know.

6135
02:50:07,070 --> 02:50:09,610
I'll wait till Wig gets back too so I don't say twice.

6136
02:50:09,610 --> 02:50:10,950
Oh, it was a DG.

6137
02:50:11,410 --> 02:50:12,990
DG was the one that landed there.

6138
02:50:14,010 --> 02:50:14,890
Wait, really?

6139
02:50:15,190 --> 02:50:15,610
Yeah.

6140
02:50:15,910 --> 02:50:16,490
All right.

6141
02:50:16,530 --> 02:50:20,630
Well, they just outed themselves so they're not playing in any tournaments anymore.

6142
02:50:24,450 --> 02:50:24,890
Abuse.

6143
02:50:24,890 --> 02:50:26,130
They're not even going to...

6144
02:50:26,130 --> 02:50:28,590
Tempo, they're not even going to make it to any event.

6145
02:50:28,650 --> 02:50:29,090
Abuse.

6146
02:50:29,090 --> 02:50:36,310
No, I mean, there's some open events, you know, and then it'll just be like, oh, it looks like your application just disappeared.

6147
02:50:36,610 --> 02:50:37,050
Oh, your name's DG?

6148
02:50:37,050 --> 02:50:39,930
Oh, I accidentally deleted this row of applications.

6149
02:50:40,410 --> 02:50:40,850
Damn.

6150
02:50:41,310 --> 02:50:43,510
Power abuse live on stream.

6151
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:44,270
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6152
02:50:44,410 --> 02:50:44,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6153
02:50:44,970 --> 02:50:46,350
So, okay.

6154
02:50:46,650 --> 02:50:47,330
So, I was saying...

6155
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:48,290
Nice.

6156
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:49,470
If they...

6157
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:50,390
You know that?

6158
02:50:50,430 --> 02:50:53,150
You know the 25K sword tournament?

6159
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:54,070
Yeah.

6160
02:50:54,190 --> 02:50:54,670
Yeah?

6161
02:50:54,670 --> 02:50:55,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6162
02:50:55,970 --> 02:50:59,230
I'm running through the qual applications for that so...

6163
02:50:59,230 --> 02:50:59,470
Oh.

6164
02:50:59,930 --> 02:51:00,590
Goodbye, DG.

6165
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:01,790
Looks like you're not making it.

6166
02:51:02,010 --> 02:51:02,450
Damn.

6167
02:51:02,710 --> 02:51:03,070
Damn.

6168
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:05,990
Oh.

6169
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:06,470
Oh.

6170
02:51:06,530 --> 02:51:07,030
Oh.

6171
02:51:07,050 --> 02:51:07,790
And you're...

6172
02:51:07,790 --> 02:51:08,530
Quit snitching.

6173
02:51:08,610 --> 02:51:08,750
He's doing...

6174
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:09,010
He's doing...

6175
02:51:09,010 --> 02:51:09,690
Huh -huh-huh-huh-huh...

6176
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:10,230
Uh-huh...

6177
02:51:12,730 --> 02:51:14,010
That was me?

6178
02:51:14,110 --> 02:51:16,150
Thought I had my gun out is crazy.

6179
02:51:18,030 --> 02:51:19,610
Yeah, that's the guy I punched you.

6180
02:51:19,690 --> 02:51:20,750
That's the guy that punched you!

6181
02:51:21,110 --> 02:51:22,810
Yeah, motherfucker dude.

6182
02:51:22,930 --> 02:51:24,170
Yo, fuck that guy!

6183
02:51:24,690 --> 02:51:26,050
Ban from watch parties.

6184
02:51:26,650 --> 02:51:27,130
Damn!

6185
02:51:27,150 --> 02:51:28,810
You're not allowed to watch the watch parties anymore.

6186
02:51:29,130 --> 02:51:32,150
Bouyg is not even going to let you watch the party.

6187
02:51:33,090 --> 02:51:33,570
Yeah,

6188
02:51:38,310 --> 02:51:39,150
I'll copyright strike you.

6189
02:51:39,170 --> 02:51:39,330
Imagine?

6190
02:51:41,250 --> 02:51:41,690
Yeah.

6191
02:51:41,690 --> 02:51:42,130
Yeah.

6192
02:51:42,250 --> 02:51:44,250
Oh yeah, if you watch our stuff, we're gonna...

6193
02:51:44,970 --> 02:51:45,410
Yeah.

6194
02:51:46,510 --> 02:51:47,090
We're gonna...

6195
02:51:47,870 --> 02:51:49,570
I'm talking about copyrights, thank you.

6196
02:51:49,630 --> 02:51:51,630
No, it's like I showed up on your stream.

6197
02:51:51,730 --> 02:51:53,250
You saw me on your stream.

6198
02:51:53,470 --> 02:51:54,130
Copyright strike.

6199
02:51:54,170 --> 02:51:55,510
That's my identity.

6200
02:51:55,730 --> 02:51:56,850
That's my video, yeah.

6201
02:51:57,130 --> 02:51:59,250
I break the number one rule of content.

6202
02:51:59,610 --> 02:52:01,830
I should do not copyright strike unfairly.

6203
02:52:03,030 --> 02:52:04,210
You should start doing it everyone.

6204
02:52:04,850 --> 02:52:05,830
Throwing it left and right.

6205
02:52:06,410 --> 02:52:07,270
You get one.

6206
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:08,170
This guy gets one.

6207
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:12,170
Yeah, I show up, you saw me in that one game, I'm gonna strike you now.

6208
02:52:14,570 --> 02:52:16,390
Say goodbye to your channel.

6209
02:52:17,350 --> 02:52:19,810
You know the most evil thing you can do?

6210
02:52:20,070 --> 02:52:22,990
They have song requests on and you may play a song.

6211
02:52:23,110 --> 02:52:23,870
Now I get that.

6212
02:52:26,510 --> 02:52:26,990
Imagine.

6213
02:52:28,310 --> 02:52:34,570
You play your own... you make an original song and then you play that original song on their channel.

6214
02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:37,750
I actually do have an original Nice Week Strong.

6215
02:52:38,170 --> 02:52:38,690
Oh my god.

6216
02:52:38,950 --> 02:52:40,590
Oh my god, use it.

6217
02:52:40,610 --> 02:52:41,230
Use it as a weapon.

6218
02:52:41,230 --> 02:52:41,670
Are you playing that at LAN?

6219
02:52:42,370 --> 02:52:43,050
Hell no.

6220
02:52:43,390 --> 02:52:45,850
Play it at LAN and copyright strike LAN.

6221
02:52:46,530 --> 02:52:47,730
A viewer made it.

6222
02:52:47,770 --> 02:52:48,390
It's really good.

6223
02:52:48,670 --> 02:52:50,350
Copyright strike everyone that's watching.

6224
02:52:50,570 --> 02:52:50,670
Yeah.

6225
02:52:51,410 --> 02:52:52,990
The pre-watch party.

6226
02:52:53,370 --> 02:52:54,510
On the stream.

6227
02:52:54,650 --> 02:52:55,170
Stream.

6228
02:52:55,710 --> 02:53:00,870
Didn't the Fine Brothers try to copyright literally React content?

6229
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:03,270
Yeah, they did, they trademarked React.

6230
02:53:03,290 --> 02:53:05,110
They're like you can't do React content.

6231
02:53:05,450 --> 02:53:06,450
That's gonna be you.

6232
02:53:06,450 --> 02:53:13,730
You bring your original song, you play it on your stream channel, and anybody that watchpotties your stream, they have to give...

6233
02:53:14,650 --> 02:53:17,630
The revenue they make from that stream, they need to give half to you.

6234
02:53:17,930 --> 02:53:19,430
Wow, I'm rich.

6235
02:53:19,630 --> 02:53:21,890
Because you had your song played.

6236
02:53:22,310 --> 02:53:24,350
It's just like YouTube where they strike you.

6237
02:53:24,810 --> 02:53:27,890
You have to give half of your... give content out of you.

6238
02:53:27,890 --> 02:53:29,230
Wait, wait, someone said their command.

6239
02:53:30,110 --> 02:53:30,410
Oh.

6240
02:53:30,730 --> 02:53:32,870
Someone else said their command.

6241
02:53:33,030 --> 02:53:34,670
The run- the run-some perk.

6242
02:53:34,670 --> 02:53:37,390
We could just go towards Thunderwatch if we wanted.

6243
02:53:38,130 --> 02:53:40,270
Okay, depending on where the ship goes...

6244
02:53:40,270 --> 02:53:40,770
Yeah.

6245
02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:44,390
We can check to see if Pylon is open too.

6246
02:53:44,550 --> 02:53:46,090
Because technically...

6247
02:53:46,090 --> 02:53:48,670
I'm gonna be honest bro, I definitely think Pylon's taking it.

6248
02:53:48,750 --> 02:53:51,430
I think Barometer is technically still open too.

6249
02:53:51,970 --> 02:53:52,390
Why?

6250
02:53:53,250 --> 02:53:57,450
1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...

6251
02:53:59,410 --> 02:54:00,250
Yeah, Barometer...

6252
02:54:00,250 --> 02:54:01,930
Oh, I should turn my audio back up.

6253
02:54:02,370 --> 02:54:04,650
Barometer and Pylon should technically be open.

6254
02:54:04,650 --> 02:54:05,350
But...

6255
02:54:05,870 --> 02:54:06,510
We'll see.

6256
02:54:06,650 --> 02:54:07,270
We'll see.

6257
02:54:08,330 --> 02:54:09,570
We'll see how it goes.

6258
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:18,200
Alright, we can't let Doki's 4 points go to waste.

6259
02:54:18,340 --> 02:54:20,220
Yeah, I worked so hard for those.

6260
02:54:20,220 --> 02:54:21,300
We got these next 3 games.

6261
02:54:21,720 --> 02:54:23,840
I worked so hard for those fights.

6262
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:25,100
We got this.

6263
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:27,020
No, really good 2kp.

6264
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:28,020
I just watched it back.

6265
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:29,940
That makes no sense how they did not kill you.

6266
02:54:32,220 --> 02:54:34,700
Okay, we'll see if anyone goes into command.

6267
02:54:34,740 --> 02:54:35,540
Wait, there's no one running around right now.

6268
02:54:35,540 --> 02:54:36,360
Okay, yeah, yeah.

6269
02:54:36,700 --> 02:54:40,240
I think when I said I was gonna ban them from all the tournaments, they got scared and left.

6270
02:54:40,620 --> 02:54:40,940
Nice.

6271
02:54:41,780 --> 02:54:43,380
That's low-key horrible, but I love it.

6272
02:54:43,700 --> 02:54:44,020
Whoa!

6273
02:54:45,020 --> 02:54:45,340
Power!

6274
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:47,340
This is the reason why Tempo's in my game.

6275
02:54:47,860 --> 02:54:48,620
Abusive power, man.

6276
02:54:48,660 --> 02:54:52,120
You guys land here, Tempo go Thunder, and then I'll go get the car.

6277
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:52,840
I'll get the car over there.

6278
02:54:52,980 --> 02:54:54,060
This is the reason why.

6279
02:54:54,460 --> 02:54:56,060
I'm gonna make sure that you're not getting landed on though.

6280
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:57,080
You're good, you're good.

6281
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:59,300
Okay, I'm landing here and then I'm gonna go up.

6282
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:00,340
Alright, yeah, we're good.

6283
02:55:00,480 --> 02:55:01,920
I'm actually surprised they left.

6284
02:55:01,920 --> 02:55:02,800
Oh my god.

6285
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:04,560
I think they actually thought you were serious.

6286
02:55:04,840 --> 02:55:05,600
That's fucked up.

6287
02:55:05,700 --> 02:55:07,220
Someone's gonna make a Reddit post about you.

6288
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:10,960
I think what actually happened is I think they had a worse game than us, to be honest.

6289
02:55:11,240 --> 02:55:11,600
Oh.

6290
02:55:12,860 --> 02:55:13,800
Which is pretty tough.

6291
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:18,600
Well, we stole their car too, so they're not really getting anything out of it by the time I get here.

6292
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:21,200
Yeah, they're just gonna keep stealing our car.

6293
02:55:21,280 --> 02:55:22,180
We just might as well dip.

6294
02:55:22,620 --> 02:55:25,900
Yeah, I'm literally taking the most important aspect of their gameplay and just giving up.

6295
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:27,140
I gotta redeploy.

6296
02:55:31,150 --> 02:55:33,270
So almost like a capital K.

6297
02:55:33,290 --> 02:55:35,410
Definitely she called them a 4K shitter.

6298
02:55:35,610 --> 02:55:36,010
Yeah.

6299
02:55:36,650 --> 02:55:38,670
Yeah, 4K shitter's crazy awesome.

6300
02:55:39,770 --> 02:55:41,410
I love that out of you, to be honest.

6301
02:55:44,330 --> 02:55:49,890
You can't... if you have your 4K badge and you lose to my badge right here with the fucking double bronze.

6302
02:55:50,070 --> 02:55:51,310
What are you doing?

6303
02:55:51,550 --> 02:55:52,530
What are you doing?

6304
02:55:52,590 --> 02:55:56,230
I don't even have a 4K badge on this account with my Bangalore.

6305
02:55:56,990 --> 02:55:58,250
That is so ridiculous.

6306
02:56:00,410 --> 02:56:01,770
Alright, wait, is there a beacon for us in?

6307
02:56:01,930 --> 02:56:02,710
No, there's not.

6308
02:56:04,650 --> 02:56:05,370
That sucks.

6309
02:56:07,470 --> 02:56:09,670
We haven't had a single beacon here.

6310
02:56:10,350 --> 02:56:14,010
Yeah, we have really bad luck when it comes to the really important rounds to not get the really important stuff.

6311
02:56:14,490 --> 02:56:15,190
To be honest.

6312
02:56:15,430 --> 02:56:16,170
That's pretty sad.

6313
02:56:16,170 --> 02:56:16,690
Not gonna lie.

6314
02:56:16,810 --> 02:56:17,250
There's a...

6315
02:56:17,250 --> 02:56:18,230
We're really good at that.

6316
02:56:18,350 --> 02:56:19,690
Just not getting the things we need.

6317
02:56:21,390 --> 02:56:22,530
The evac here.

6318
02:56:22,870 --> 02:56:23,770
I already have an evac.

6319
02:56:23,890 --> 02:56:24,230
I'm good.

6320
02:56:25,890 --> 02:56:27,510
There's no evo cash for me to take either.

6321
02:56:27,610 --> 02:56:28,630
Like, this is fucking torch.

6322
02:56:28,910 --> 02:56:29,270
Yeah.

6323
02:56:29,350 --> 02:56:30,850
I'll just go below and see what happens.

6324
02:56:31,850 --> 02:56:32,790
If I die, I'll scream, okay?

6325
02:56:32,790 --> 02:56:33,870
Alright, don't worry.

6326
02:56:34,030 --> 02:56:34,770
I hear ya.

6327
02:56:35,370 --> 02:56:37,270
There's a... Are you gonna shoot that flier?

6328
02:56:37,350 --> 02:56:38,330
Cause I am for you.

6329
02:56:38,510 --> 02:56:39,590
Zeus just scanned us.

6330
02:56:39,710 --> 02:56:40,930
Keep that in mind.

6331
02:56:41,330 --> 02:56:42,450
They're gonna tell we're really separate then.

6332
02:56:42,630 --> 02:56:43,330
That's not good.

6333
02:56:43,750 --> 02:56:45,390
There's no way they're gonna rush us, right?

6334
02:56:45,650 --> 02:56:48,850
Well, they're gonna go for... they're gonna go for that... uh...

6335
02:56:49,330 --> 02:56:49,730
What?

6336
02:56:49,890 --> 02:56:51,310
They're gonna go for this thing.

6337
02:56:51,990 --> 02:56:52,610
Evo cash?

6338
02:56:52,870 --> 02:56:53,430
They are, yeah.

6339
02:56:54,250 --> 02:56:55,570
I'm gonna come back up to you guys right now anyway.

6340
02:56:56,150 --> 02:56:56,930
Uh huh.

6341
02:56:58,310 --> 02:57:02,010
We should wait for Stormcatcher to leave then go back to Storm and get the beacons.

6342
02:57:02,790 --> 02:57:05,250
I don't see anything good yet.

6343
02:57:05,530 --> 02:57:07,470
I haven't found the syringe.

6344
02:57:08,970 --> 02:57:11,030
We should also get that Evo when they're gone.

6345
02:57:11,290 --> 02:57:11,810
For sure.

6346
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:13,610
I'm gonna kill this dragon.

6347
02:57:14,230 --> 02:57:14,710
Okay.

6348
02:57:15,010 --> 02:57:19,970
Just for like a little bit of... just a little bit of flier stuff.

6349
02:57:22,810 --> 02:57:23,510
Oh, nice.

6350
02:57:23,550 --> 02:57:23,910
A bat.

6351
02:57:27,530 --> 02:57:28,010
Alrighty.

6352
02:57:28,370 --> 02:57:29,610
Does someone want that 3x?

6353
02:57:29,830 --> 02:57:30,250
Yeah.

6354
02:57:30,510 --> 02:57:31,190
That's a few.

6355
02:57:31,250 --> 02:57:31,550
Yeah, he was good.

6356
02:57:31,550 --> 02:57:32,550
Oh, he's so high!

6357
02:57:32,550 --> 02:57:32,630
He's so high!

6358
02:57:32,970 --> 02:57:35,170
Alright, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, jump off, come here.

6359
02:57:35,210 --> 02:57:36,190
Oh, they're shooting from behind us.

6360
02:57:36,290 --> 02:57:38,290
Oh, they took that Zeus zip in the back.

6361
02:57:38,490 --> 02:57:38,730
The pad?

6362
02:57:38,730 --> 02:57:38,990
Uh oh.

6363
02:57:39,690 --> 02:57:40,730
No, no, I can't take the pad.

6364
02:57:41,210 --> 02:57:41,450
Just come on.

6365
02:57:41,450 --> 02:57:41,970
Just get in my car.

6366
02:57:42,110 --> 02:57:42,570
Literally, keyboard.

6367
02:57:42,690 --> 02:57:43,150
Can you guys get to me?

6368
02:57:43,470 --> 02:57:43,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6369
02:57:44,530 --> 02:57:45,030
I got it.

6370
02:57:45,070 --> 02:57:47,710
I don't think tempo is... I don't know.

6371
02:57:47,710 --> 02:57:48,310
I guess tempo's okay.

6372
02:57:48,310 --> 02:57:48,690
Tempo's okay.

6373
02:57:48,790 --> 02:57:49,190
Tempo's okay.

6374
02:57:49,850 --> 02:57:50,870
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

6375
02:57:51,330 --> 02:57:51,950
Do not finish.

6376
02:57:52,090 --> 02:57:52,350
Do not finish.

6377
02:57:52,350 --> 02:57:52,590
Get in.

6378
02:57:52,750 --> 02:57:54,010
Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.

6379
02:57:54,010 --> 02:57:56,890
Where the fuck... they were right behind... how did they get there?

6380
02:57:56,990 --> 02:57:57,550
I didn't even see them.

6381
02:57:57,890 --> 02:57:59,690
They took that zip in the very far back.

6382
02:57:59,830 --> 02:58:00,110
Oh!

6383
02:58:01,270 --> 02:58:02,930
Swig, are you okay to drive here?

6384
02:58:03,250 --> 02:58:03,890
This driving is scaring me.

6385
02:58:04,130 --> 02:58:05,390
This driving is scaring me.

6386
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:06,590
This driving is murdering me.

6387
02:58:07,050 --> 02:58:07,910
Give me comms real quick.

6388
02:58:07,990 --> 02:58:08,470
Give me comms real quick.

6389
02:58:09,050 --> 02:58:10,030
I'll take the EVO.

6390
02:58:10,030 --> 02:58:10,610
I'll take the EVO.

6391
02:58:10,690 --> 02:58:11,170
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

6392
02:58:11,210 --> 02:58:11,370
I got it.

6393
02:58:11,470 --> 02:58:11,730
Okay, okay.

6394
02:58:11,930 --> 02:58:13,610
Got it?

6395
02:58:13,630 --> 02:58:14,170
We got blue now?

6396
02:58:15,150 --> 02:58:17,630
And I go on the... we go up on Storm and scan anything?

6397
02:58:17,970 --> 02:58:18,690
We're going right now.

6398
02:58:18,730 --> 02:58:19,190
We're going right now.

6399
02:58:19,890 --> 02:58:20,890
I'll scan up and we go up.

6400
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:21,050
Okay.

6401
02:58:22,250 --> 02:58:22,650
We're good.

6402
02:58:22,970 --> 02:58:23,650
Alright, nice.

6403
02:58:24,310 --> 02:58:24,990
We survived.

6404
02:58:25,350 --> 02:58:27,390
I did not have a chance to get a lot of meds though.

6405
02:58:27,910 --> 02:58:28,310
It's okay.

6406
02:58:28,390 --> 02:58:28,950
We don't really have much.

6407
02:58:29,050 --> 02:58:29,390
Yeah.

6408
02:58:29,390 --> 02:58:30,250
Good job.

6409
02:58:30,430 --> 02:58:31,490
We'll hit these Spikens too.

6410
02:58:33,170 --> 02:58:33,730
For sure.

6411
02:58:33,950 --> 02:58:36,130
I'm gonna see if there's extra meds anywhere.

6412
02:58:36,390 --> 02:58:37,670
I need like... I'm gonna try to find...

6413
02:58:37,670 --> 02:58:37,770
Not last.

6414
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:37,950
Not last.

6415
02:58:38,250 --> 02:58:38,890
Not last!

6416
02:58:38,970 --> 02:58:39,470
Let's go!

6417
02:58:40,270 --> 02:58:40,990
Not us.

6418
02:58:41,770 --> 02:58:42,410
We'll take it.

6419
02:58:42,450 --> 02:58:42,730
We'll take it.

6420
02:58:43,350 --> 02:58:43,990
We got CA.

6421
02:58:44,350 --> 02:58:45,190
Shield side let me know.

6422
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:46,550
Hopefully grab a bat.

6423
02:58:47,270 --> 02:58:48,750
Yeah, we should all craft the bat up for sure.

6424
02:58:50,830 --> 02:58:52,290
Alright, I'm gonna craft a bat then.

6425
02:58:52,570 --> 02:58:53,770
Okay, they're on Thunder.

6426
02:58:53,890 --> 02:58:53,990
They're on Thunder.

6427
02:58:53,990 --> 02:58:53,990
They're on Thunder.

6428
02:58:54,610 --> 02:58:55,070
That's fine.

6429
02:58:55,170 --> 02:58:55,830
I'm looking for them right now.

6430
02:58:58,590 --> 02:58:59,590
Kids are fucking idiots.

6431
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:00,610
Alright.

6432
02:59:01,090 --> 02:59:03,070
Alright, we probably can't hit the people scan but craft the bat...

6433
02:59:03,070 --> 02:59:04,690
I can like... smoke it maybe?

6434
02:59:05,750 --> 02:59:06,110
Um...

6435
02:59:06,110 --> 02:59:06,650
Do it.

6436
02:59:06,750 --> 02:59:06,970
Maybe.

6437
02:59:08,070 --> 02:59:08,430
Yeah.

6438
02:59:09,310 --> 02:59:11,010
Yeah, they're running far right.

6439
02:59:11,250 --> 02:59:11,730
We're good.

6440
02:59:11,750 --> 02:59:11,970
We're good.

6441
02:59:12,050 --> 02:59:12,510
I'm gonna finish this.

6442
02:59:12,630 --> 02:59:12,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6443
02:59:12,950 --> 02:59:13,950
We should be able to now.

6444
02:59:14,990 --> 02:59:16,130
There's gonna be an echo HQ zone.

6445
02:59:18,390 --> 02:59:19,630
Yeah, they're running back there.

6446
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:19,970
Yeah.

6447
02:59:20,170 --> 02:59:21,590
Oh, look at all these.

6448
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:21,990
Yeah.

6449
02:59:22,190 --> 02:59:23,410
How many evac do we have?

6450
02:59:23,490 --> 02:59:23,730
Do we know?

6451
02:59:23,730 --> 02:59:24,370
I have one.

6452
02:59:24,530 --> 02:59:25,090
We have three.

6453
02:59:25,410 --> 02:59:26,090
We all have...

6454
02:59:26,090 --> 02:59:26,310
We have three.

6455
02:59:26,550 --> 02:59:27,190
Alright, come with me.

6456
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:29,390
Do we wanna grab any... like we wanna grab what?

6457
02:59:29,430 --> 02:59:29,750
That one?

6458
02:59:30,030 --> 02:59:30,610
Yeah, probably.

6459
02:59:30,930 --> 02:59:31,590
Let's probably grab that.

6460
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:34,250
Let's grab that last EVA.

6461
02:59:36,170 --> 02:59:36,890
Just land on it.

6462
02:59:37,010 --> 02:59:37,210
Alright.

6463
02:59:38,430 --> 02:59:39,250
And we have another...

6464
02:59:39,250 --> 02:59:40,450
One bat, 16 cells.

6465
02:59:41,130 --> 02:59:43,230
Um... I have... Oh, I have six bats.

6466
02:59:43,410 --> 02:59:43,830
Oh, I have...

6467
02:59:43,830 --> 02:59:44,910
Yeah, seven bats.

6468
02:59:45,030 --> 02:59:45,870
Does anyone need extra bats?

6469
02:59:45,950 --> 02:59:46,330
What the fuck?

6470
02:59:46,350 --> 02:59:46,910
I'll take one.

6471
02:59:46,910 --> 02:59:47,190
I have one.

6472
02:59:47,310 --> 02:59:47,450
Yeah, yeah.

6473
02:59:47,450 --> 02:59:47,990
What the fuck?

6474
02:59:48,050 --> 02:59:48,870
How do I get seven?

6475
02:59:49,610 --> 02:59:50,610
I'm gonna land over here.

6476
02:59:50,690 --> 02:59:50,850
Yeah?

6477
02:59:51,190 --> 02:59:51,730
Yeah, you can.

6478
02:59:51,810 --> 02:59:52,390
Go for it buddy.

6479
02:59:52,390 --> 02:59:52,750
You're chillin'.

6480
02:59:52,750 --> 02:59:53,110
Yeah, yeah.

6481
02:59:53,110 --> 02:59:53,350
You're good.

6482
02:59:53,410 --> 02:59:54,210
You should not be over there.

6483
02:59:54,270 --> 02:59:57,350
We wanna walk in and just get to Echo somewhere, but Echo's pretty taken right now.

6484
02:59:57,790 --> 02:59:58,910
Actually, only two spots taken.

6485
02:59:59,010 --> 02:59:59,830
We can probably find somewhere to go.

6486
03:00:00,090 --> 03:00:01,890
Getting in the middle of Echo wouldn't be bad either.

6487
03:00:02,070 --> 03:00:03,030
Okay, who wants bats?

6488
03:00:03,310 --> 03:00:03,910
Who needs bats?

6489
03:00:04,250 --> 03:00:05,950
Uh, I'll take some in this house.

6490
03:00:06,610 --> 03:00:07,410
I'll drop it here.

6491
03:00:08,290 --> 03:00:09,270
I dropped two bats.

6492
03:00:10,150 --> 03:00:11,050
You wanna take one?

6493
03:00:11,310 --> 03:00:12,190
Do you wanna grab one?

6494
03:00:13,110 --> 03:00:13,730
I'll take one.

6495
03:00:13,810 --> 03:00:14,430
Yeah, I have one right now.

6496
03:00:14,590 --> 03:00:16,250
Yeah, you... No, you grab the one that's there.

6497
03:00:16,310 --> 03:00:16,890
I left one there.

6498
03:00:17,170 --> 03:00:17,670
Thanks buddy.

6499
03:00:17,730 --> 03:00:18,090
Appreciate it.

6500
03:00:18,430 --> 03:00:18,750
Okay.

6501
03:00:18,970 --> 03:00:19,810
Now the next two cells.

6502
03:00:20,730 --> 03:00:22,630
Alright, we're gonna try to keep rotating.

6503
03:00:23,110 --> 03:00:24,230
We're gonna get to Pi-1 here.

6504
03:00:24,270 --> 03:00:25,910
There was no one really in Pi-1, so we're gonna keep walking on in.

6505
03:00:25,970 --> 03:00:26,270
Alright.

6506
03:00:26,630 --> 03:00:28,550
If you see any extra syringes, let me know.

6507
03:00:28,650 --> 03:00:29,210
I only have two.

6508
03:00:29,530 --> 03:00:30,170
There's two in here.

6509
03:00:30,270 --> 03:00:30,690
Okay, nice.

6510
03:00:30,710 --> 03:00:31,170
I got it.

6511
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:31,950
Alright, now four.

6512
03:00:32,130 --> 03:00:32,390
Yeah.

6513
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:38,620
They were in front of us here earlier, but I don't see them now, so...

6514
03:00:38,620 --> 03:00:39,840
Keep on following me.

6515
03:00:39,860 --> 03:00:40,400
We are blue though.

6516
03:00:40,440 --> 03:00:40,720
We're good.

6517
03:00:40,840 --> 03:00:44,080
Okay, I feel like Tempo has played a lot better since getting off of the roofs.

6518
03:00:44,840 --> 03:00:45,380
I agree.

6519
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:47,920
Yeah, I feel like we've done a lot better now that he's not there.

6520
03:00:50,100 --> 03:00:52,240
I think the roofs were definitely the problem.

6521
03:00:53,080 --> 03:00:53,580
It's Tempo.

6522
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:54,200
Without a doubt.

6523
03:00:54,220 --> 03:00:54,400
Yeah.

6524
03:00:55,100 --> 03:00:56,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

6525
03:00:57,740 --> 03:00:59,340
Alright, I see another evac tower here.

6526
03:00:59,420 --> 03:00:59,540
Oh, no.

6527
03:00:59,580 --> 03:00:59,840
It's a Mech.

6528
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:00,100
Never mind.

6529
03:01:01,940 --> 03:01:02,720
I'm gonna scan this.

6530
03:01:02,760 --> 03:01:03,560
We can loot this up a little bit more.

6531
03:01:03,620 --> 03:01:05,900
We're gonna keep walking on this left side tree line.

6532
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:07,180
We're gonna evac from here, okay?

6533
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:08,700
We wanna grab that thing, right?

6534
03:01:08,760 --> 03:01:09,200
On the left?

6535
03:01:09,500 --> 03:01:09,980
Which one?

6536
03:01:10,160 --> 03:01:10,800
Yeah, you go first.

6537
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:11,200
Yeah, you go first.

6538
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:11,780
Yeah, correct.

6539
03:01:12,480 --> 03:01:13,120
We definitely do.

6540
03:01:15,180 --> 03:01:16,940
I'm trying to see if there's anything I should take.

6541
03:01:17,480 --> 03:01:18,720
Yeah, so right now I'm pretty good.

6542
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:19,560
There's another 3x.

6543
03:01:19,980 --> 03:01:20,960
I took it three times, yeah.

6544
03:01:21,420 --> 03:01:22,340
I'm gonna get this Evo cache.

6545
03:01:22,740 --> 03:01:24,100
We are inside the next room.

6546
03:01:24,760 --> 03:01:25,720
Alright, I think I'm good.

6547
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:27,980
I need like a stock if you guys buy an extra stock.

6548
03:01:27,980 --> 03:01:28,620
I'm looking top pylon.

6549
03:01:28,740 --> 03:01:29,660
I don't see anyone.

6550
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:30,980
What do you wanna rotate to?

6551
03:01:31,400 --> 03:01:35,420
We should go top pylon right now and actually hit that fucking ring console if there's no one up there.

6552
03:01:35,540 --> 03:01:35,680
Alright.

6553
03:01:36,260 --> 03:01:36,580
Alright.

6554
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:38,520
Scatted then, just in case.

6555
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:39,140
I am.

6556
03:01:39,140 --> 03:01:40,740
Yeah, I could be like, you know, you wanna stop in here.

6557
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:41,020
I'm scanning.

6558
03:01:41,920 --> 03:01:42,420
No one's here.

6559
03:01:42,560 --> 03:01:43,540
I'm gonna take the head of it right now.

6560
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:44,600
Hey, I'm...

6561
03:01:44,600 --> 03:01:45,560
There's a digi here.

6562
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:46,840
Close range.

6563
03:01:47,400 --> 03:01:47,980
I'm downstairs.

6564
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:49,320
I'm about to scan the thing.

6565
03:01:49,420 --> 03:01:50,240
What floor is it on?

6566
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:51,580
I'm gonna craft another badge.

6567
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:52,400
It's down here with me.

6568
03:01:52,620 --> 03:01:53,100
Okay, cool.

6569
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:53,800
Wait, wait.

6570
03:01:54,220 --> 03:01:54,500
What?

6571
03:01:54,620 --> 03:01:54,820
You're good.

6572
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:55,960
On the left, on the left, on the left.

6573
03:01:56,200 --> 03:01:56,440
We're good.

6574
03:01:57,540 --> 03:01:58,480
It should be close to us.

6575
03:01:58,560 --> 03:01:59,360
I heard something for sure.

6576
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:00,880
I'm coming to you, Wade.

6577
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:01,400
I hear them.

6578
03:02:01,400 --> 03:02:01,920
I hear them underneath it.

6579
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:02,300
They're running away.

6580
03:02:02,300 --> 03:02:02,560
They're running away.

6581
03:02:02,780 --> 03:02:03,060
Okay.

6582
03:02:03,140 --> 03:02:03,520
They are?

6583
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:03,920
They're running to you.

6584
03:02:04,040 --> 03:02:04,540
Yeah, they're running away.

6585
03:02:04,560 --> 03:02:04,860
Yeah, you're good.

6586
03:02:04,940 --> 03:02:05,020
You're good.

6587
03:02:05,180 --> 03:02:05,700
I'm gonna scan.

6588
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:06,400
Yeah, yeah.

6589
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:07,140
Definitely scan it for sure.

6590
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:10,780
Now we might use your E-back tower.

6591
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:12,020
Yeah, there... I see them.

6592
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:13,100
Little armor.

6593
03:02:14,040 --> 03:02:14,700
Yeah, there's armor.

6594
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:15,340
Crack one.

6595
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:15,840
I see some here too.

6596
03:02:17,180 --> 03:02:17,300
Hmm.

6597
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:18,760
What is free?

6598
03:02:18,840 --> 03:02:20,460
Is there a player scan we can hit?

6599
03:02:20,500 --> 03:02:20,580
No.

6600
03:02:20,580 --> 03:02:21,820
We should just go over here and take a risk.

6601
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:22,500
We're gonna make a risk, okay?

6602
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:22,920
Alright.

6603
03:02:22,980 --> 03:02:23,920
I mean, we do have redeploy.

6604
03:02:24,620 --> 03:02:25,640
Yeah, we're gonna take a risk here.

6605
03:02:25,780 --> 03:02:27,240
I have no idea what's free, but we're gonna find out.

6606
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:29,540
19 squads up there was a little bit scary.

6607
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:29,960
I can't lie.

6608
03:02:32,080 --> 03:02:32,320
Alright.

6609
03:02:32,380 --> 03:02:32,620
You good?

6610
03:02:32,980 --> 03:02:33,360
It's fine.

6611
03:02:33,460 --> 03:02:34,300
I can smoke us too.

6612
03:02:34,940 --> 03:02:35,640
Yeah, we should be good.

6613
03:02:35,720 --> 03:02:36,640
I don't think these guys will shoot us off.

6614
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:39,040
Pretty stupid waste of time doing this to us.

6615
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:40,400
Alright.

6616
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:40,860
I'm ready.

6617
03:02:41,280 --> 03:02:42,100
Yeah, we're gonna redeploy here.

6618
03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:43,440
I don't have one, so whenever you guys put it up.

6619
03:02:43,540 --> 03:02:43,780
Okay.

6620
03:02:43,820 --> 03:02:44,060
Ready?

6621
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:45,020
Wait, wait, wait.

6622
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:45,520
Yeah, yeah.

6623
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:45,920
Okay.

6624
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:46,520
We're gonna try it.

6625
03:02:46,940 --> 03:02:48,380
We're gonna try to land something over here, okay?

6626
03:02:48,380 --> 03:02:48,720
Alright.

6627
03:02:48,780 --> 03:02:49,560
Just follow my lead.

6628
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:50,940
I have no idea what's free and we're gonna find out.

6629
03:02:51,400 --> 03:02:52,800
We're gonna find out now.

6630
03:02:54,040 --> 03:02:55,380
Wait, we can't go over this.

6631
03:02:55,400 --> 03:02:55,800
The way it doesn't reach.

6632
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:56,180
We're idiots.

6633
03:02:56,460 --> 03:02:56,820
Go this way.

6634
03:02:56,920 --> 03:02:57,060
Go back down.

6635
03:02:57,280 --> 03:02:58,040
Go back down.

6636
03:02:58,100 --> 03:02:58,360
Go back down.

6637
03:02:58,380 --> 03:02:58,380
Go back down.

6638
03:02:58,560 --> 03:02:58,840
Wait.

6639
03:02:58,840 --> 03:02:59,560
Go straight back down?

6640
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:00,360
Yeah, straight back down.

6641
03:03:00,420 --> 03:03:00,720
That's correct.

6642
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:00,920
That's correct.

6643
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:01,080
Okay.

6644
03:03:01,160 --> 03:03:01,820
It does not make it.

6645
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:03,700
Wait, we could've went the sideways.

6646
03:03:04,180 --> 03:03:04,600
It's fine.

6647
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:04,940
It's fine.

6648
03:03:04,980 --> 03:03:05,320
Just come here.

6649
03:03:05,460 --> 03:03:05,920
Go back.

6650
03:03:05,960 --> 03:03:06,600
Just go back to buy one.

6651
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:07,220
It doesn't reach over.

6652
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:07,800
Alright.

6653
03:03:08,020 --> 03:03:09,100
I'd rather just play top tower right now.

6654
03:03:09,180 --> 03:03:11,900
I'd rather wait for the zone close and then we just play fucking...

6655
03:03:11,900 --> 03:03:12,720
Hit it one more time?

6656
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:13,340
Yes.

6657
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:13,560
Yes.

6658
03:03:13,720 --> 03:03:14,000
Okay.

6659
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:15,180
Goodbye, redeploy.

6660
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:17,700
For some reason, I thought you could redeploy over there.

6661
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:20,960
I swear to God, I've watched people redeploy.

6662
03:03:21,780 --> 03:03:22,900
I'm just gonna play the hide for now.

6663
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:31,240
I remember when some... I had a tournament and then somebody... we were doing hide and seek and then they tried to redeploy from there and it didn't reach.

6664
03:03:31,260 --> 03:03:32,680
So one of the seekers died in zone.

6665
03:03:33,640 --> 03:03:34,160
Oh, really?

6666
03:03:34,460 --> 03:03:34,820
Yeah.

6667
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:35,220
Yeah.

6668
03:03:35,440 --> 03:03:36,580
That's fucking hilarious.

6669
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:38,240
It's the same thing too.

6670
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:38,900
It was right here.

6671
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:39,980
Yeah.

6672
03:03:40,040 --> 03:03:41,840
I was like, you probably know we can't get back over there.

6673
03:03:42,480 --> 03:03:43,060
On me.

6674
03:03:43,080 --> 03:03:43,760
On me, I guess.

6675
03:03:45,180 --> 03:03:46,080
I probably should know those things.

6676
03:03:46,220 --> 03:03:47,980
You probably should have actually.

6677
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:49,260
Yeah, Mr. Watch.

6678
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:50,840
Oh, I almost fell.

6679
03:03:51,260 --> 03:03:51,700
That's good.

6680
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:53,300
Wait, I can't climb up this.

6681
03:03:53,400 --> 03:03:53,500
What?

6682
03:03:53,660 --> 03:03:55,020
Are you doing a zone read?

6683
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:56,800
Yeah, we're gonna rush this closest.

6684
03:03:56,940 --> 03:03:57,100
Yeah.

6685
03:03:57,840 --> 03:03:59,700
I look north... east side.

6686
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:00,520
I look east side.

6687
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:02,000
There's no one next to this pack.

6688
03:04:02,220 --> 03:04:03,000
We wanna get this pack too.

6689
03:04:03,020 --> 03:04:03,700
You guys stay up here.

6690
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:04,240
I'm gonna go with this pack.

6691
03:04:04,300 --> 03:04:04,460
Okay?

6692
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:04,720
Okay.

6693
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:05,780
I'm looking at east side.

6694
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:09,560
I'm gonna watch over you or try to from here.

6695
03:04:09,920 --> 03:04:10,240
Okay.

6696
03:04:10,780 --> 03:04:11,460
We should be good.

6697
03:04:11,560 --> 03:04:12,420
There's no one over here, I don't think.

6698
03:04:12,460 --> 03:04:12,520
Yeah.

6699
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:13,820
I'm watching top hill, so...

6700
03:04:14,220 --> 03:04:15,160
I don't see anybody on east side.

6701
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:16,920
Yeah, we should be fine.

6702
03:04:17,840 --> 03:04:20,860
For some reason, we're the only team coming from highland right now, which I don't understand why.

6703
03:04:21,580 --> 03:04:22,960
You're clear so far.

6704
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:24,340
I'm looking up the hill for you.

6705
03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:25,320
You're good, buddy.

6706
03:04:26,680 --> 03:04:27,380
I got a wingman.

6707
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:28,380
I'm definitely taking it.

6708
03:04:28,660 --> 03:04:28,980
Okay.

6709
03:04:30,560 --> 03:04:31,700
Anyone need it two times or anything or no?

6710
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:32,880
I do.

6711
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:33,740
If you can bring it over.

6712
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:34,660
I'll take it, yeah.

6713
03:04:34,740 --> 03:04:34,940
Gotcha.

6714
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:37,220
We're still clear.

6715
03:04:37,940 --> 03:04:38,360
Yep, yep.

6716
03:04:39,320 --> 03:04:40,280
I got evo off that too.

6717
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:41,260
Nice.

6718
03:04:42,660 --> 03:04:42,980
Huge.

6719
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:44,040
Are you almost red, though?

6720
03:04:44,160 --> 03:04:44,480
Big.

6721
03:04:45,160 --> 03:04:45,700
No, no, no.

6722
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:46,540
Definitely not even close to red.

6723
03:04:46,660 --> 03:04:47,560
Still 1900 off.

6724
03:04:49,500 --> 03:04:49,820
Okay.

6725
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:50,900
That side's still clear.

6726
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:52,540
There's nobody on east side.

6727
03:04:53,260 --> 03:04:55,260
I hear people fighting in the prowler section.

6728
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:55,940
Yeah.

6729
03:04:56,040 --> 03:04:56,920
That's actually good, though.

6730
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:58,820
Yeah, because they're almost going to have to come to us.

6731
03:04:59,260 --> 03:04:59,900
Yeah, that's fine.

6732
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:02,240
I'm going to go down and get ready to scan.

6733
03:05:02,600 --> 03:05:03,540
Yeah, go for it, McDucky.

6734
03:05:03,860 --> 03:05:04,180
Yeah.

6735
03:05:04,180 --> 03:05:04,960
Here's your two times one.

6736
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:05,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6737
03:05:06,800 --> 03:05:07,380
I'll grab it.

6738
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:08,160
Hey.

6739
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:09,840
Light ammo, two of you.

6740
03:05:09,880 --> 03:05:10,120
How's it going?

6741
03:05:11,320 --> 03:05:12,660
I'm looking at our east side still.

6742
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:15,000
And also the north side a little.

6743
03:05:15,720 --> 03:05:16,000
Okay.

6744
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:17,780
The Wrangler ulted the north.

6745
03:05:18,340 --> 03:05:18,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6746
03:05:18,960 --> 03:05:19,500
I see them over there.

6747
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:19,880
I see them coming over.

6748
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:20,840
They're starting to come over.

6749
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:21,160
Yeah.

6750
03:05:21,240 --> 03:05:22,900
They're definitely going to fight over there and just come this way.

6751
03:05:22,960 --> 03:05:23,160
It's fine.

6752
03:05:23,240 --> 03:05:23,840
I think we just let them.

6753
03:05:23,920 --> 03:05:24,680
We can't get there quick enough.

6754
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:25,440
All right.

6755
03:05:25,460 --> 03:05:27,280
We see that sound, but I'll straight echo 100%.

6756
03:05:27,280 --> 03:05:28,040
We going now?

6757
03:05:28,340 --> 03:05:29,500
I need to go now for sure.

6758
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:29,960
All right.

6759
03:05:29,960 --> 03:05:30,360
I'm heading over.

6760
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:30,780
All right.

6761
03:05:31,140 --> 03:05:32,340
We're going to evac this way then.

6762
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:33,180
Okay.

6763
03:05:33,220 --> 03:05:34,160
We're going to evac around the mountain.

6764
03:05:34,380 --> 03:05:35,480
Evac around three.

6765
03:05:35,560 --> 03:05:35,760
Yeah.

6766
03:05:35,760 --> 03:05:36,580
That's what I was thinking.

6767
03:05:36,720 --> 03:05:37,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6768
03:05:37,180 --> 03:05:37,340
Yeah.

6769
03:05:37,340 --> 03:05:37,780
We're going to have to.

6770
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:38,520
We're going to have to this time.

6771
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:40,040
I don't see anyone below this.

6772
03:05:40,040 --> 03:05:40,980
This is our last evac.

6773
03:05:40,980 --> 03:05:44,100
Well, I didn't see anyone here when you were looting the pack.

6774
03:05:44,760 --> 03:05:45,040
Okay.

6775
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:46,300
So...

6776
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:47,420
I think so.

6777
03:05:47,500 --> 03:05:48,980
There's like this little corridor over here.

6778
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:49,640
I want to try to get to.

6779
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:50,240
You know what I'm talking about?

6780
03:05:50,300 --> 03:05:50,860
The little tunnel in there?

6781
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:51,080
Yeah.

6782
03:05:51,640 --> 03:05:51,920
Yeah.

6783
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:54,680
I want to try to land in that tunnel and just put traps down and smoke immediately.

6784
03:05:55,140 --> 03:05:55,420
Okay.

6785
03:05:55,960 --> 03:05:56,960
So put an evac right here.

6786
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:58,420
Like smoke ourselves or smoke the enemy?

6787
03:05:59,020 --> 03:06:00,700
We're going to smoke ourselves right when we land in there.

6788
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:01,920
I'll go first so you guys know where to land.

6789
03:06:02,480 --> 03:06:03,080
We'll see though.

6790
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:04,020
There might be a team there.

6791
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:05,160
So I'm going to find out when we land in there.

6792
03:06:05,740 --> 03:06:07,260
Oh, they're shooting at you back now, bro.

6793
03:06:07,640 --> 03:06:08,040
Oh, no.

6794
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:08,400
We're not.

6795
03:06:08,400 --> 03:06:08,680
We're not.

6796
03:06:08,720 --> 03:06:09,260
We can't.

6797
03:06:09,380 --> 03:06:10,840
That's so fucking cringe.

6798
03:06:10,980 --> 03:06:11,200
Man.

6799
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:13,000
I don't think we can.

6800
03:06:13,160 --> 03:06:13,440
Yeah.

6801
03:06:13,500 --> 03:06:14,040
What do we want to do?

6802
03:06:14,620 --> 03:06:15,680
We don't have an evac now, right?

6803
03:06:15,820 --> 03:06:16,000
No.

6804
03:06:16,060 --> 03:06:16,600
We don't have an evac.

6805
03:06:16,760 --> 03:06:17,320
That was our last one.

6806
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:19,280
That's so bad for us actually.

6807
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:22,680
I mean we're technically... is there anyone over here?

6808
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:23,740
I'm not sure.

6809
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:24,780
Our team just landed far right side.

6810
03:06:25,060 --> 03:06:26,720
Dude, this kid shooting at you back is so cringe.

6811
03:06:26,840 --> 03:06:28,880
I'm going to go look in this bench for an evac once I can get us to stay here.

6812
03:06:29,020 --> 03:06:29,200
Okay.

6813
03:06:29,540 --> 03:06:31,040
I'm looking behind us just in case.

6814
03:06:31,080 --> 03:06:32,500
Yeah, just get us out if we don't have an evac.

6815
03:06:32,640 --> 03:06:33,260
This is so fucked.

6816
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:36,160
I really fucked us over that first one.

6817
03:06:36,220 --> 03:06:36,740
That's so cringe.

6818
03:06:38,360 --> 03:06:39,540
I want your back from Pylon.

6819
03:06:39,700 --> 03:06:40,080
I'm watching.

6820
03:06:40,460 --> 03:06:40,740
I'm watching.

6821
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:41,720
There's a guy running.

6822
03:06:42,780 --> 03:06:43,020
Where?

6823
03:06:43,160 --> 03:06:43,500
On Pylon?

6824
03:06:43,900 --> 03:06:44,600
No, no, no, no, no.

6825
03:06:46,060 --> 03:06:47,880
No, it's in front of Tempo in front of us.

6826
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:49,240
I'm looking behind us now.

6827
03:06:49,460 --> 03:06:50,540
There's a team in Pylon though.

6828
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:51,320
They're going to come over to the side.

6829
03:06:51,460 --> 03:06:52,660
We're going to have to try to kill these guys when they rotate in.

6830
03:06:52,720 --> 03:06:53,020
Wait, really?

6831
03:06:53,080 --> 03:06:53,240
Where?

6832
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:53,820
I don't see them.

6833
03:06:53,900 --> 03:06:54,240
Over here.

6834
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:55,300
They're going to be on the middle side.

6835
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:56,020
Okay.

6836
03:06:56,220 --> 03:06:57,140
I don't see him still.

6837
03:06:57,700 --> 03:06:58,800
They're going to come this way though for sure.

6838
03:06:59,460 --> 03:07:01,000
I'm going to play down a little bit more and walk up to you guys.

6839
03:07:01,260 --> 03:07:01,500
Okay.

6840
03:07:02,060 --> 03:07:02,940
I don't want these kids to get like...

6841
03:07:02,940 --> 03:07:03,620
I'm going to get in cover here.

6842
03:07:04,340 --> 03:07:04,860
Yeah, you're good.

6843
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:05,080
You're good.

6844
03:07:05,540 --> 03:07:06,320
They're going to rotate over here.

6845
03:07:06,380 --> 03:07:07,300
They're going to play just in Pylon.

6846
03:07:08,180 --> 03:07:08,420
Check.

6847
03:07:08,420 --> 03:07:09,620
I saw one guy at least.

6848
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,660
It might be more than one.

6849
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:11,860
But they're shooting their traps out right now.

6850
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:12,280
They're top Pylon.

6851
03:07:13,060 --> 03:07:14,460
I just hope I don't get shot from behind.

6852
03:07:14,500 --> 03:07:14,740
I see them.

6853
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:14,840
I see them.

6854
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:15,300
They're running down.

6855
03:07:15,380 --> 03:07:15,780
They're running down to the right.

6856
03:07:15,780 --> 03:07:16,200
Yeah, they're dropping.

6857
03:07:16,680 --> 03:07:17,400
I'm going to go to this tree.

6858
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:17,940
I'm going to go to this tree.

6859
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:18,900
Yeah, yeah.

6860
03:07:18,940 --> 03:07:19,580
Try to get in close on this.

6861
03:07:19,760 --> 03:07:20,480
Yes, yes, yes.

6862
03:07:20,500 --> 03:07:20,980
We want to fight this.

6863
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:21,820
We do not want these kids to live.

6864
03:07:22,360 --> 03:07:23,120
I'm looking now.

6865
03:07:23,580 --> 03:07:24,600
They just scanned Beacon.

6866
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:25,360
That's fine.

6867
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:26,760
So...

6868
03:07:27,600 --> 03:07:28,660
They're going to rotate in on this right side.

6869
03:07:28,780 --> 03:07:29,860
Tempo, you're going out of zone by the way.

6870
03:07:29,980 --> 03:07:30,140
So...

6871
03:07:30,140 --> 03:07:30,560
Yep.

6872
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:35,120
We need to try to get a knock when they cross over the wall.

6873
03:07:35,260 --> 03:07:35,560
They're here.

6874
03:07:35,600 --> 03:07:35,740
They're here.

6875
03:07:36,040 --> 03:07:36,320
They're here.

6876
03:07:36,320 --> 03:07:36,960
Yeah, we're good.

6877
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:37,460
Yeah, I see them.

6878
03:07:37,500 --> 03:07:37,660
I see them.

6879
03:07:37,740 --> 03:07:38,400
I see us too.

6880
03:07:39,700 --> 03:07:40,960
It's actually so bad for us.

6881
03:07:40,980 --> 03:07:43,060
Just because this team on the top can't 100% rotate and kill us here.

6882
03:07:43,440 --> 03:07:43,760
Yeah.

6883
03:07:44,120 --> 03:07:45,860
They're on this box behind this car.

6884
03:07:46,700 --> 03:07:47,640
What color armor do you know?

6885
03:07:47,880 --> 03:07:48,140
Purple.

6886
03:07:48,220 --> 03:07:48,400
Purple.

6887
03:07:49,100 --> 03:07:49,420
Purple?

6888
03:07:49,740 --> 03:07:50,060
Yeah.

6889
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:51,020
Okay.

6890
03:07:51,080 --> 03:07:52,160
We're going to have to just 3v3 these guys.

6891
03:07:52,280 --> 03:07:52,660
I want to have an ulti.

6892
03:07:52,660 --> 03:07:53,040
So are now.

6893
03:07:53,460 --> 03:07:53,780
Nope.

6894
03:07:54,120 --> 03:07:54,440
Nope.

6895
03:07:54,640 --> 03:07:54,960
Okay.

6896
03:07:55,320 --> 03:07:56,580
This is so bad for us.

6897
03:07:56,580 --> 03:07:56,920
Fuck me.

6898
03:07:57,040 --> 03:07:58,140
I have ult here though.

6899
03:07:58,740 --> 03:07:59,380
Yeah, you're good.

6900
03:07:59,700 --> 03:08:00,020
Wait.

6901
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:00,340
Did they...

6902
03:08:02,440 --> 03:08:04,480
I think we just have to late rotate in the zone, boys.

6903
03:08:04,620 --> 03:08:05,260
I'm going to be honest.

6904
03:08:05,340 --> 03:08:05,840
I think we're just tired.

6905
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:06,240
But they're getting shot.

6906
03:08:06,320 --> 03:08:07,300
We're trying to find another team.

6907
03:08:07,720 --> 03:08:08,000
Yeah.

6908
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:08,620
No team's holding them.

6909
03:08:08,760 --> 03:08:08,920
Yeah.

6910
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,220
Another team shot them.

6911
03:08:10,880 --> 03:08:12,260
There's one guy behind that tree though.

6912
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:12,960
He's by himself.

6913
03:08:13,700 --> 03:08:13,980
Yeah.

6914
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:14,180
Yeah.

6915
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:17,360
Where's this other squad at?

6916
03:08:18,560 --> 03:08:19,980
Can we make it around the zone if we need to?

6917
03:08:20,340 --> 03:08:20,620
Yeah.

6918
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:20,900
We can.

6919
03:08:21,340 --> 03:08:23,780
I think we're going to have to like get late and just walk in.

6920
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:25,480
Hopefully all these guys just forgot about us to be honest.

6921
03:08:26,700 --> 03:08:27,160
I don't know.

6922
03:08:27,180 --> 03:08:28,880
I think they finished the fight already.

6923
03:08:29,180 --> 03:08:29,580
I don't know.

6924
03:08:29,580 --> 03:08:30,380
I don't know what happened over there.

6925
03:08:30,380 --> 03:08:30,740
They're not shooting anymore.

6926
03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:31,740
They're not shooting each other.

6927
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:32,320
I'm not sure.

6928
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:33,480
Ult to us.

6929
03:08:33,480 --> 03:08:33,860
Ult to the left.

6930
03:08:34,100 --> 03:08:34,620
Come to me guys.

6931
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:34,940
Come to me.

6932
03:08:34,940 --> 03:08:35,160
Come to me.

6933
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:35,560
Come to me.

6934
03:08:35,560 --> 03:08:35,820
Come to me now.

6935
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:36,140
Come to me now.

6936
03:08:36,520 --> 03:08:37,400
We're going to cross over to the zone.

6937
03:08:37,400 --> 03:08:37,820
We're going to cross over.

6938
03:08:37,920 --> 03:08:38,320
I have an arch.

6939
03:08:40,580 --> 03:08:42,900
I'm going to get hit by like three bang ults.

6940
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:43,080
Me too.

6941
03:08:43,220 --> 03:08:44,320
I might be hit by this too.

6942
03:08:44,760 --> 03:08:45,180
I'm dead.

6943
03:08:45,220 --> 03:08:45,480
I'm dead.

6944
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:46,280
I'm dead to the zone.

6945
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:46,940
I'm on it.

6946
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:47,200
I'm on it.

6947
03:08:47,200 --> 03:08:47,500
I'm skipping the bot.

6948
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:49,520
I got five.

6949
03:08:49,620 --> 03:08:49,940
I'm on it.

6950
03:08:49,940 --> 03:08:50,260
I'm on it.

6951
03:08:50,260 --> 03:08:50,260
I'm on it.

6952
03:08:50,260 --> 03:08:50,260
I'm on it.

6953
03:08:50,260 --> 03:08:50,460
I'm like, wait.

6954
03:08:50,540 --> 03:08:51,040
I'm stuck.

6955
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:51,260
I'm stuck.

6956
03:08:51,260 --> 03:08:51,560
I'm stuck.

6957
03:08:52,280 --> 03:08:53,100
I ulted them too.

6958
03:08:53,240 --> 03:08:53,800
I ulted them too.

6959
03:08:54,400 --> 03:08:54,720
Yeah.

6960
03:08:54,760 --> 03:08:55,060
You're vibing.

6961
03:08:55,560 --> 03:08:56,340
So, but they all...

6962
03:08:56,340 --> 03:08:56,520
We're dead.

6963
03:08:56,540 --> 03:08:56,780
We're dead.

6964
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:58,000
They scared us.

6965
03:08:58,020 --> 03:08:59,000
No way!

6966
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:01,920
These kids are still sitting here, man.

6967
03:09:01,960 --> 03:09:02,900
No way!

6968
03:09:04,460 --> 03:09:05,080
No way.

6969
03:09:05,080 --> 03:09:05,640
I'm getting ran up.

6970
03:09:05,660 --> 03:09:06,000
I'll just...

6971
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:08,340
Oh my god.

6972
03:09:08,380 --> 03:09:09,040
If we have an evac...

6973
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:09,640
No!

6974
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:10,920
This is not like playing Valk, man.

6975
03:09:11,180 --> 03:09:11,500
We had three.

6976
03:09:11,580 --> 03:09:13,480
We had three evacs too.

6977
03:09:13,580 --> 03:09:14,500
That's the worst we are.

6978
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:15,840
We only used two.

6979
03:09:16,020 --> 03:09:16,520
What was the third one?

6980
03:09:16,660 --> 03:09:17,380
Oh, I'm top of the swarm.

6981
03:09:17,580 --> 03:09:18,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6982
03:09:18,860 --> 03:09:20,240
They have an evac.

6983
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:22,440
We should... I think we had the evac here.

6984
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:23,300
That was the corner.

6985
03:09:23,980 --> 03:09:24,480
Well, no.

6986
03:09:24,540 --> 03:09:25,240
They could have got that.

6987
03:09:25,280 --> 03:09:26,040
They could have shot that out too.

6988
03:09:26,080 --> 03:09:27,420
They just were too distracted on my loot box.

6989
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:31,760
I just didn't expect the team to be playing on the fucking cannon right there, man.

6990
03:09:31,780 --> 03:09:33,580
They looted the team.

6991
03:09:33,660 --> 03:09:34,080
They're dead.

6992
03:09:34,280 --> 03:09:34,820
No, no.

6993
03:09:35,320 --> 03:09:35,640
Oh, no.

6994
03:09:36,140 --> 03:09:36,220
No way.

6995
03:09:36,300 --> 03:09:36,620
No way.

6996
03:09:36,940 --> 03:09:37,260
Unless...

6997
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:37,740
Oh, they're dead.

6998
03:09:37,860 --> 03:09:38,060
Yes.

6999
03:09:38,400 --> 03:09:39,340
Thank fucking god.

7000
03:09:42,060 --> 03:09:43,100
I hope you die.

7001
03:09:43,460 --> 03:09:44,720
Honestly, this is the team I don't mind.

7002
03:09:44,840 --> 03:09:45,820
I wish we kind of lived.

7003
03:09:45,940 --> 03:09:47,360
The other fucking squad is a bunch of fucking idiots.

7004
03:09:48,240 --> 03:09:50,360
So, we got one point from that though.

7005
03:09:50,840 --> 03:09:52,140
I'm so assed though, man.

7006
03:09:52,220 --> 03:09:52,800
Oh my god.

7007
03:09:52,840 --> 03:09:53,660
Look at all these nades.

7008
03:09:53,700 --> 03:09:54,240
Jesus Christ.

7009
03:09:55,800 --> 03:09:56,380
No way.

7010
03:09:57,900 --> 03:10:00,340
We're definitely going to play Valk though on World's Edge for sure.

7011
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:00,560
Okay.

7012
03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:00,840
Okay.

7013
03:10:01,240 --> 03:10:02,160
We need some backdoob.

7014
03:10:02,240 --> 03:10:02,720
I'll be right back.

7015
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:03,080
They do.

7016
03:10:03,280 --> 03:10:03,480
They do.

7017
03:10:03,480 --> 03:10:06,540
We need our chat's wig.

7018
03:11:22,340 --> 03:11:23,300
I'm back.

7019
03:11:24,340 --> 03:11:25,640
Did you entertain our chat?

7020
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:26,580
No.

7021
03:11:26,840 --> 03:11:27,240
What?

7022
03:11:28,020 --> 03:11:28,680
Why not?

7023
03:11:28,840 --> 03:11:30,120
I was commuting the whole time.

7024
03:11:30,180 --> 03:11:30,440
Told you.

7025
03:11:30,500 --> 03:11:30,800
What?

7026
03:11:31,140 --> 03:11:31,580
No.

7027
03:11:31,660 --> 03:11:35,960
I'm so sad that team just played cannon and shot an E back to our house.

7028
03:11:35,980 --> 03:11:36,180
Yeah.

7029
03:11:36,180 --> 03:11:37,100
Instead of power toys and rotate.

7030
03:11:37,420 --> 03:11:38,300
That's mind blowing.

7031
03:11:38,840 --> 03:11:39,320
Yeah.

7032
03:11:39,460 --> 03:11:42,000
And then they let the other team behind us rotate.

7033
03:11:44,340 --> 03:11:46,900
Why can they rotate and not us?

7034
03:11:47,340 --> 03:11:49,680
They had zero benefit of shooting our E back out.

7035
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:50,660
They literally had nothing.

7036
03:11:51,100 --> 03:11:52,100
That was so dumb.

7037
03:11:52,140 --> 03:11:53,080
They're like, fuck these people.

7038
03:11:53,140 --> 03:11:55,780
I think we had more than one team shoot us because the E back tower died so fast.

7039
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:56,480
No.

7040
03:11:56,520 --> 03:11:57,940
It was all three of them just shooting it.

7041
03:11:58,080 --> 03:11:58,360
Oh.

7042
03:11:59,320 --> 03:12:02,440
Which makes no sense because us E backing is better for them.

7043
03:12:02,500 --> 03:12:04,620
Like, I don't understand why the fuck they're shooting our E back out.

7044
03:12:04,740 --> 03:12:07,240
Because they're like, fuck that team and they knew it was us.

7045
03:12:07,420 --> 03:12:08,160
They had the...

7046
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:08,840
No.

7047
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:10,640
What they actually said was, what shoot E back?

7048
03:12:10,840 --> 03:12:11,980
I have no idea how to do that.

7049
03:12:11,980 --> 03:12:12,740
I don't know how to play the game correctly.

7050
03:12:12,900 --> 03:12:13,340
I can only say that.

7051
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:20,000
Oh shit.

7052
03:12:20,660 --> 03:12:22,120
That's the specific words out of their mouth.

7053
03:12:22,520 --> 03:12:24,680
This is round two challengers.

7054
03:12:24,780 --> 03:12:27,500
I don't think anybody knows how to play in round two.

7055
03:12:28,040 --> 03:12:28,260
Yeah, I agree.

7056
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:29,760
Bro, that's your wingman.

7057
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:31,160
Yeah, it is.

7058
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:32,240
That's your gun.

7059
03:12:32,420 --> 03:12:33,800
And he's whipping every shot.

7060
03:12:33,880 --> 03:12:35,180
And he's missing every shot with it.

7061
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:35,640
Oh my god.

7062
03:12:37,020 --> 03:12:37,420
Bro.

7063
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:38,120
Holy fuck.

7064
03:12:38,380 --> 03:12:40,400
Bro, I don't... bro, that's sad.

7065
03:12:41,980 --> 03:12:42,960
Are you still in Challenger circuit?

7066
03:12:43,540 --> 03:12:43,940
Damn!

7067
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:46,280
So are we though.

7068
03:12:46,340 --> 03:12:47,060
So are we though, guys.

7069
03:12:47,220 --> 03:12:48,160
So are we.

7070
03:12:48,160 --> 03:12:50,760
I mean, we did die before them.

7071
03:12:51,140 --> 03:12:51,560
We did.

7072
03:12:51,580 --> 03:12:52,520
We did die before them.

7073
03:12:53,940 --> 03:12:56,300
First part is, we would have been so safe in the spot I wanted to go to.

7074
03:12:56,340 --> 03:12:56,820
I'm so sad.

7075
03:12:57,560 --> 03:12:58,340
Every time.

7076
03:12:58,560 --> 03:12:59,520
Every fucking time.

7077
03:13:00,100 --> 03:13:01,040
That's just one point.

7078
03:13:01,100 --> 03:13:01,980
Why shoot us then?

7079
03:13:02,220 --> 03:13:02,520
Why?

7080
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:04,280
We're literally leaving your back.

7081
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:05,900
Why do you not want us to rotate?

7082
03:13:06,160 --> 03:13:07,000
What are you doing?

7083
03:13:07,180 --> 03:13:10,540
Because they're like, what if we get that three extra KP though?

7084
03:13:11,980 --> 03:13:12,840
We got literally none of it.

7085
03:13:13,500 --> 03:13:16,680
Like, when it's all about the possibilities.

7086
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:18,000
True.

7087
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:24,880
My chat got to the part where we fucked up our redeploy.

7088
03:13:25,380 --> 03:13:25,900
Oh yeah.

7089
03:13:26,140 --> 03:13:27,160
I can't believe we can't get it.

7090
03:13:27,280 --> 03:13:28,600
I actually love you for a long time.

7091
03:13:30,040 --> 03:13:32,800
I guess I'm just so used to like fucking Valkoving over the house.

7092
03:13:32,820 --> 03:13:35,640
I thought we were gonna... I thought we were wrapping around the mountain.

7093
03:13:35,980 --> 03:13:38,420
Well, to be fair, we wouldn't have reached the spot I wanted to if we had to wrap around the mountainside.

7094
03:13:38,600 --> 03:13:40,220
Yeah, but then we could have extra redeploy.

7095
03:13:41,180 --> 03:13:43,080
Nah, we would have fucking landed on somebody for sure.

7096
03:13:43,080 --> 03:13:44,960
I mean, we could have maybe made it work, but...

7097
03:13:45,880 --> 03:13:50,940
Yeah, I thought we were going around and I was like, alright, I'm ready to go like halfway around and then I had to turn back.

7098
03:13:51,280 --> 03:13:54,960
To be fair though, there's just no world where that team would sure you back out and not let us go past them.

7099
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:58,200
We should have let Tempo be free and just see what happens.

7100
03:14:00,600 --> 03:14:03,380
I could have, I could have ratted to zone, I could have ratted to zone six.

7101
03:14:03,540 --> 03:14:03,560
Yeah, yeah.

7102
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:05,780
We should have let him be free and just see what happens.

7103
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:07,520
I would be in a tree right now.

7104
03:14:09,020 --> 03:14:09,480
Spit it.

7105
03:14:15,270 --> 03:14:15,850
Alright, so, thank you.

7106
03:14:15,850 --> 03:14:16,230
Alright, so, thank you.

7107
03:14:16,230 --> 03:14:18,030
We would have climbed up a tree and then we would have been top five.

7108
03:14:18,170 --> 03:14:19,010
That could have been us.

7109
03:14:19,770 --> 03:14:23,230
Like all these teams were fighting and then we were in that top five.

7110
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:24,850
Oh, these are an all bowler team.

7111
03:14:25,390 --> 03:14:28,550
This spot, this spot we're in right now is actually exactly right next to where I want to go.

7112
03:14:28,630 --> 03:14:29,770
I'm so sad, man.

7113
03:14:30,030 --> 03:14:31,230
I could have been Ash.

7114
03:14:31,890 --> 03:14:33,450
I'm so... I could have been Ash.

7115
03:14:34,910 --> 03:14:36,010
I could have been Ash.

7116
03:14:36,290 --> 03:14:37,210
I could have been Ash.

7117
03:14:38,110 --> 03:14:38,470
That's good.

7118
03:14:40,630 --> 03:14:41,610
I'm so sad.

7119
03:14:42,150 --> 03:14:42,510
Yeah.

7120
03:14:43,570 --> 03:14:45,030
It's a horrible cat wall too.

7121
03:14:45,110 --> 03:14:45,990
What the fuck are we doing?

7122
03:14:47,090 --> 03:14:48,730
What if, why is he playing cat?

7123
03:14:48,830 --> 03:14:49,490
Is cat meta?

7124
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:51,590
Cats aren't bad right now.

7125
03:14:51,810 --> 03:14:52,310
It's alright.

7126
03:14:52,550 --> 03:14:53,650
I don't know what's meta.

7127
03:15:00,290 --> 03:15:01,230
Oof, they're so dead.

7128
03:15:01,390 --> 03:15:01,670
Yeah.

7129
03:15:01,790 --> 03:15:02,790
I don't think they're gonna live this.

7130
03:15:03,190 --> 03:15:04,230
Yeah, they're definitely not.

7131
03:15:04,610 --> 03:15:07,130
Yeah, they're definitely, that team definitely is not first.

7132
03:15:07,850 --> 03:15:08,250
GG's.

7133
03:15:08,510 --> 03:15:08,910
Yeah!

7134
03:15:09,130 --> 03:15:09,810
We're not second though.

7135
03:15:11,150 --> 03:15:11,950
Oh man.

7136
03:15:12,330 --> 03:15:13,230
Love that for us.

7137
03:15:13,410 --> 03:15:14,250
We're doing it!

7138
03:15:14,950 --> 03:15:15,990
The one point.

7139
03:15:16,690 --> 03:15:18,290
We can pretend to be that team.

7140
03:15:18,930 --> 03:15:19,330
True.

7141
03:15:19,510 --> 03:15:19,910
Spent.

7142
03:15:22,890 --> 03:15:23,730
Spent, spent, spent.

7143
03:15:23,910 --> 03:15:26,110
We are gonna be...

7144
03:15:26,110 --> 03:15:27,110
We're gonna be like 15th probably.

7145
03:15:27,290 --> 03:15:28,170
Probably in...

7146
03:15:28,170 --> 03:15:28,870
Yeah.

7147
03:15:28,890 --> 03:15:29,530
15th, 16th.

7148
03:15:29,550 --> 03:15:30,450
Yeah, somewhere around there.

7149
03:15:30,650 --> 03:15:31,390
Yeah, without a doubt.

7150
03:15:32,170 --> 03:15:32,970
Yeah, 100%.

7151
03:15:32,970 --> 03:15:36,250
We should really only be like five points ahead, so...

7152
03:15:36,250 --> 03:15:36,730
Yeah.

7153
03:15:37,090 --> 03:15:39,610
We just need a good last two games.

7154
03:15:39,690 --> 03:15:41,130
We just need to get to zone, bro.

7155
03:15:41,290 --> 03:15:42,430
Yeah, we need to be at zone.

7156
03:15:44,270 --> 03:15:46,450
Hardest thing about Challenge Circuit is all the dumbasses that play.

7157
03:15:46,450 --> 03:15:46,650
They don't play edge.

7158
03:15:46,750 --> 03:15:47,370
That's the hardest thing.

7159
03:15:47,650 --> 03:15:48,010
Yeah.

7160
03:15:48,650 --> 03:15:51,590
There's a lot of teams that play edge in this one, I think.

7161
03:15:52,910 --> 03:15:53,850
I left my team.

7162
03:15:56,470 --> 03:15:57,770
Alright, I am waiting for...

7163
03:15:57,770 --> 03:15:58,110
Who's this person?

7164
03:15:59,890 --> 03:16:01,290
I don't know who this person is.

7165
03:16:01,890 --> 03:16:06,370
I'm always worried I accidentally rejected somebody that I actually know, because so many people just randomly add me.

7166
03:16:06,650 --> 03:16:07,230
That's so true.

7167
03:16:07,590 --> 03:16:07,950
Actually.

7168
03:16:08,370 --> 03:16:10,410
And like, I don't reject, I just straight up block.

7169
03:16:10,710 --> 03:16:11,530
I don't...

7170
03:16:13,290 --> 03:16:14,230
I think that happened.

7171
03:16:14,710 --> 03:16:15,990
I block so much.

7172
03:16:16,090 --> 03:16:16,430
I block so much.

7173
03:16:16,430 --> 03:16:17,470
I blocked 100% of my friends.

7174
03:16:17,550 --> 03:16:18,870
Without a doubt, I definitely blocked friends.

7175
03:16:18,990 --> 03:16:25,310
I think like somebody who was in my team for one of the tournaments added me, but I was like, who is this fucker?

7176
03:16:25,390 --> 03:16:26,450
And then I actually blocked.

7177
03:16:27,550 --> 03:16:30,410
And after I blocked them, I was like, wait, they were on my team.

7178
03:16:31,190 --> 03:16:32,070
That's so funny.

7179
03:16:32,890 --> 03:16:33,930
That is so ridiculous.

7180
03:16:34,770 --> 03:16:35,130
Alright.

7181
03:16:35,410 --> 03:16:36,070
We are...

7182
03:16:36,070 --> 03:16:36,270
Yup.

7183
03:16:36,430 --> 03:16:36,790
Exactly.

7184
03:16:37,670 --> 03:16:38,030
14.

7185
03:16:39,730 --> 03:16:41,830
And 10th is four points away from us.

7186
03:16:41,930 --> 03:16:42,390
Oh, it's not that long.

7187
03:16:42,390 --> 03:16:43,330
We just need a good last two games.

7188
03:16:43,430 --> 03:16:43,790
Exactly.

7189
03:16:43,810 --> 03:16:44,970
Exactly what we thought would happen.

7190
03:16:44,970 --> 03:16:45,930
I'm playing World Chess.

7191
03:16:46,070 --> 03:16:46,130
I'm playing World Chess.

7192
03:16:46,130 --> 03:16:46,410
I'm playing World Chess.

7193
03:16:46,410 --> 03:16:47,810
I'm playing Valkyrie's Game.

7194
03:16:47,950 --> 03:16:48,230
Okay.

7195
03:16:48,230 --> 03:16:48,350
Okay.

7196
03:16:48,350 --> 03:16:48,830
Not Bloodhound.

7197
03:16:48,910 --> 03:16:49,190
I blood.

7198
03:16:49,470 --> 03:16:49,770
Yeah.

7199
03:16:49,970 --> 03:16:50,310
Okay.

7200
03:16:50,510 --> 03:16:50,850
Okay.

7201
03:16:50,850 --> 03:16:54,410
Let me make sure my banner represents correctly what I am as a player.

7202
03:16:55,970 --> 03:16:56,670
So I'll be honest.

7203
03:16:56,790 --> 03:16:57,790
Where are we going on this map?

7204
03:16:57,890 --> 03:16:58,430
We don't even know, right?

7205
03:16:58,630 --> 03:16:58,970
Yeah.

7206
03:16:59,030 --> 03:17:00,130
We'll figure it out.

7207
03:17:00,150 --> 03:17:00,930
We don't even know.

7208
03:17:02,250 --> 03:17:03,550
Oh, the badges aren't fixed yet.

7209
03:17:04,030 --> 03:17:05,510
We'll just type siphon to start with.

7210
03:17:06,070 --> 03:17:07,630
The badges aren't fixed yet.

7211
03:17:08,450 --> 03:17:09,590
I will guarantee those.

7212
03:17:09,650 --> 03:17:10,970
Siphon is probably just fucked up.

7213
03:17:11,730 --> 03:17:12,450
No, we can just...

7214
03:17:12,450 --> 03:17:13,390
I can just type the thing again.

7215
03:17:13,570 --> 03:17:13,750
You'll...

7216
03:17:13,750 --> 03:17:14,470
We will play...

7217
03:17:14,470 --> 03:17:16,230
You won't get invited to any tournament.

7218
03:17:16,250 --> 03:17:16,390
I'm not sure.

7219
03:17:16,730 --> 03:17:17,130
Fair.

7220
03:17:17,330 --> 03:17:17,930
That's cool.

7221
03:17:18,030 --> 03:17:18,510
That's good.

7222
03:17:18,570 --> 03:17:18,890
That's good.

7223
03:17:19,670 --> 03:17:20,790
Fence always work.

7224
03:17:21,490 --> 03:17:22,370
Everyone likes to play.

7225
03:17:24,090 --> 03:17:24,590
That's good.

7226
03:17:24,650 --> 03:17:25,710
Threatening other people.

7227
03:17:25,750 --> 03:17:26,670
That's a good thing to do.

7228
03:17:27,430 --> 03:17:27,830
Yeah.

7229
03:17:29,290 --> 03:17:30,590
Are we good people, guys?

7230
03:17:30,850 --> 03:17:31,290
We can start threatening more.

7231
03:17:31,370 --> 03:17:31,770
Yes.

7232
03:17:31,910 --> 03:17:32,410
Are we?

7233
03:17:32,410 --> 03:17:32,670
Are you?

7234
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:32,910
Yes.

7235
03:17:32,910 --> 03:17:33,030
Okay.

7236
03:17:33,370 --> 03:17:33,770
Yes.

7237
03:17:33,870 --> 03:17:34,270
Yes.

7238
03:17:34,270 --> 03:17:35,550
Maybe not you, but yes.

7239
03:17:35,750 --> 03:17:35,950
Wait.

7240
03:17:35,990 --> 03:17:37,270
What about me?

7241
03:17:37,870 --> 03:17:38,270
Why?

7242
03:17:39,050 --> 03:17:39,730
Yeah, maybe.

7243
03:17:39,850 --> 03:17:41,070
Maybe not you, but yes.

7244
03:17:41,390 --> 03:17:41,790
What?

7245
03:17:41,990 --> 03:17:43,190
What did I do?

7246
03:17:44,770 --> 03:17:45,890
Just got to be nicer, man.

7247
03:17:47,270 --> 03:17:49,110
I'm not the one that's threatening people!

7248
03:17:50,830 --> 03:17:52,230
Also, lobby code's out.

7249
03:17:52,670 --> 03:17:53,970
Yeah, oh we're in, don't worry.

7250
03:17:54,490 --> 03:17:58,210
Oh wait, hey guys, did you guys know that the lobby code is out?

7251
03:17:58,650 --> 03:17:59,870
Every fucking time.

7252
03:18:00,110 --> 03:18:01,750
Did you guys know that the lobby code is out?

7253
03:18:07,900 --> 03:18:09,000
Someone's signing fissure.

7254
03:18:10,160 --> 03:18:10,600
Tissue.

7255
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:13,140
Yay!

7256
03:18:14,580 --> 03:18:15,740
So far so good!

7257
03:18:17,580 --> 03:18:18,760
I believe in us.

7258
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:21,660
I always do.

7259
03:18:27,590 --> 03:18:28,030
Alrighty.

7260
03:18:28,790 --> 03:18:30,550
What's the worst that could happen?

7261
03:18:32,590 --> 03:18:35,730
I mean, we should- I think we might be free here, I'm not sure.

7262
03:18:35,790 --> 03:18:36,150
We'll see.

7263
03:18:37,230 --> 03:18:39,950
If we're not free though, there's no way we can really swerve.

7264
03:18:40,010 --> 03:18:40,670
That's the only problem.

7265
03:18:40,730 --> 03:18:42,350
We can swerve, Tree is still open.

7266
03:18:42,510 --> 03:18:44,030
Tree and Harvester are still open.

7267
03:18:51,300 --> 03:18:54,320
I'm crossing off as I see people post stuff.

7268
03:18:54,840 --> 03:18:55,280
Okay.

7269
03:18:55,300 --> 03:18:56,460
Is it still open?

7270
03:18:57,100 --> 03:18:57,500
Yup.

7271
03:18:57,900 --> 03:18:58,300
Yay!

7272
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:01,520
Okay.

7273
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:05,320
We got this.

7274
03:19:06,340 --> 03:19:10,500
Yeah, we can still- just in case, we can still swerve, Harvester and Tree.

7275
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:12,540
That's fair.

7276
03:19:12,660 --> 03:19:13,860
I'm down for that actually, that's pretty good.

7277
03:19:14,980 --> 03:19:16,360
We got this, I believe.

7278
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:19,000
I totally believe in us.

7279
03:19:19,660 --> 03:19:21,020
This is the game where we're in the top five.

7280
03:19:21,020 --> 03:19:23,160
This is where we got all of our points, yeah.

7281
03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:23,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

7282
03:19:23,920 --> 03:19:25,840
World's Edge is where we got a lot of our points.

7283
03:19:25,960 --> 03:19:26,480
This is it.

7284
03:19:27,500 --> 03:19:27,780
Which?

7285
03:19:31,760 --> 03:19:32,040
Hmmmm.

7286
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:43,480
Okay, so Lava Siphon and we swerved to Tree, it wouldn't be that bad.

7287
03:19:43,680 --> 03:19:44,380
We can make that work.

7288
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:47,280
We just really need to focus on getting this fucking end zone, bro.

7289
03:19:47,380 --> 03:19:49,860
If we just get a good spot in zone, we're literally just guaranteed to fucking qual.

7290
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:50,660
We just need a beacon.

7291
03:19:51,400 --> 03:19:52,960
It's just avoiding the bullshit, man.

7292
03:19:53,020 --> 03:19:54,420
It's so hard for us to do that sometimes.

7293
03:19:55,160 --> 03:20:01,620
In that situation, we 100% could have if we had a Valk and we get into zone and probably get top five, but it's really fucking hard when the evac's just getting shot out for no reason at all.

7294
03:20:01,620 --> 03:20:01,780
Yeah.

7295
03:20:01,780 --> 03:20:01,840
We're in that situation.

7296
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:02,400
Yeah.

7297
03:20:02,720 --> 03:20:03,400
At the lows.

7298
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:10,620
We're better at World's Edge than we are on Stormpoint.

7299
03:20:11,460 --> 03:20:12,400
Yeah, we're a World's Edge team.

7300
03:20:12,560 --> 03:20:12,940
That's us.

7301
03:20:13,240 --> 03:20:16,040
We'll never figure out Stormpoint, but that's okay.

7302
03:20:17,500 --> 03:20:17,900
Agreed.

7303
03:20:18,360 --> 03:20:19,520
Alright, one more.

7304
03:20:19,740 --> 03:20:21,080
We're a World's Edge squad.

7305
03:20:21,160 --> 03:20:22,460
We're a World's Edge squad.

7306
03:20:22,720 --> 03:20:23,320
That's us.

7307
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:30,360
I love these guys are talking about fucking Rainbow Six, dude.

7308
03:20:30,520 --> 03:20:32,060
Bro, I don't think they're locked in, man.

7309
03:20:32,200 --> 03:20:32,600
I swear.

7310
03:20:33,180 --> 03:20:33,940
Which team is it?

7311
03:20:34,460 --> 03:20:35,100
I don't know.

7312
03:20:36,520 --> 03:20:38,620
Okay, they are... which team?

7313
03:20:38,740 --> 03:20:39,060
Which team?

7314
03:20:39,180 --> 03:20:42,560
I swear, they're talking about Rainbow Six Siege and they're higher ranked than us.

7315
03:20:42,820 --> 03:20:43,460
I don't know.

7316
03:20:43,560 --> 03:20:44,040
I don't...

7317
03:20:46,560 --> 03:20:48,280
Guys, I don't know.

7318
03:20:48,320 --> 03:20:49,180
I think we have a problem.

7319
03:20:50,660 --> 03:20:51,380
No, we're good.

7320
03:20:51,460 --> 03:20:51,660
We're good.

7321
03:20:51,720 --> 03:20:53,220
I'm listening to fucking no hands right now.

7322
03:20:53,260 --> 03:20:53,940
We're so locked in.

7323
03:20:54,280 --> 03:20:56,460
I thought that we're supposed to be better this time.

7324
03:20:56,780 --> 03:20:58,000
Girl, drop it to the floor.

7325
03:20:58,300 --> 03:21:00,180
The amount of charge rifle shots.

7326
03:21:01,300 --> 03:21:03,100
Are we supposed to be better gamers?

7327
03:21:03,100 --> 03:21:04,360
This time around?

7328
03:21:04,920 --> 03:21:07,000
We have the speed to throw this cash.

7329
03:21:07,620 --> 03:21:08,480
No, we're doing good.

7330
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:08,900
We're doing good.

7331
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:13,540
We're actually in a pretty good... we just got top 15 both games in a row.

7332
03:21:13,640 --> 03:21:14,240
That's pretty good, actually.

7333
03:21:14,440 --> 03:21:16,640
Last week, we got like 19th in the second game.

7334
03:21:17,840 --> 03:21:21,100
And then like 19th again, I think.

7335
03:21:22,380 --> 03:21:24,360
And then the last game, we also got 19th last game.

7336
03:21:24,440 --> 03:21:24,800
Last week.

7337
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:25,620
No, okay.

7338
03:21:25,720 --> 03:21:30,700
No, last week, we got two games where we didn't place very well, but we still got top 12.

7339
03:21:31,760 --> 03:21:32,120
Yeah.

7340
03:21:32,180 --> 03:21:32,860
We still got top 12.

7341
03:21:33,080 --> 03:21:33,280
We're in the last game too.

7342
03:21:33,400 --> 03:21:33,660
We're good.

7343
03:21:33,800 --> 03:21:34,900
We're in a better streak already.

7344
03:21:35,320 --> 03:21:37,740
I thought we were 14th right now.

7345
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:38,600
Yeah.

7346
03:21:39,060 --> 03:21:39,380
Yeah.

7347
03:21:39,440 --> 03:21:42,120
Which is better, but through two games last week, we were not at 14th.

7348
03:21:42,120 --> 03:21:43,600
We were at 14th only because of one game though.

7349
03:21:43,800 --> 03:21:44,040
Oh.

7350
03:21:45,080 --> 03:21:45,800
We got one game.

7351
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:46,400
We got the RV.

7352
03:21:46,620 --> 03:21:47,720
And it was just like two games.

7353
03:21:47,820 --> 03:21:48,140
Yeah.

7354
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:48,440
Yeah.

7355
03:21:48,440 --> 03:21:48,580
Yeah.

7356
03:21:48,580 --> 03:21:49,620
And then we got second place.

7357
03:21:50,040 --> 03:21:52,380
And then we got like 19th, 19th, 19th.

7358
03:21:52,380 --> 03:21:52,520
Okay.

7359
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:53,580
We just need to repeat that.

7360
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:55,200
We need to repeat that exact scenario.

7361
03:21:55,940 --> 03:21:56,260
Yeah.

7362
03:21:56,260 --> 03:21:56,500
Yeah.

7363
03:21:56,500 --> 03:21:58,100
We need to go find an RV.

7364
03:21:58,380 --> 03:22:00,160
We need to find an RV, guys.

7365
03:22:00,780 --> 03:22:01,560
Guys, yes.

7366
03:22:01,620 --> 03:22:02,620
You're understanding a little bit.

7367
03:22:02,660 --> 03:22:02,980
This is good.

7368
03:22:02,980 --> 03:22:03,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7369
03:22:03,960 --> 03:22:04,780
We figured it out.

7370
03:22:05,020 --> 03:22:08,100
We need spots where no one can shoot us because we don't have the firepower for this.

7371
03:22:08,140 --> 03:22:08,460
Exactly.

7372
03:22:09,280 --> 03:22:10,440
We're a strategic team.

7373
03:22:10,500 --> 03:22:11,040
We're not a shooting team.

7374
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:11,360
Wait.

7375
03:22:11,360 --> 03:22:12,800
Let me go plug in Evan's controller.

7376
03:22:13,180 --> 03:22:13,380
Hello.

7377
03:22:14,080 --> 03:22:14,400
Wait.

7378
03:22:14,480 --> 03:22:15,600
What are you trying to say about his controller, bro?

7379
03:22:15,720 --> 03:22:15,960
Wait.

7380
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:16,120
What?

7381
03:22:16,280 --> 03:22:16,400
What?

7382
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:17,020
He's cheating?

7383
03:22:17,280 --> 03:22:17,440
Huh?

7384
03:22:17,540 --> 03:22:17,940
He's cheating?

7385
03:22:18,720 --> 03:22:20,280
You need so bad, huh?

7386
03:22:21,180 --> 03:22:21,500
No.

7387
03:22:21,540 --> 03:22:24,060
You plug in Hal's controller so you can get to the story.

7388
03:22:24,760 --> 03:22:27,240
There's a special thing on there, you know?

7389
03:22:27,380 --> 03:22:27,660
Yeah.

7390
03:22:27,680 --> 03:22:28,320
On the back of it?

7391
03:22:28,600 --> 03:22:28,920
Yeah.

7392
03:22:29,540 --> 03:22:31,460
I thought it was a rumble pack, but it wasn't.

7393
03:22:31,640 --> 03:22:32,960
He downloaded a program for it?

7394
03:22:34,380 --> 03:22:34,820
No.

7395
03:22:34,920 --> 03:22:35,460
Don't worry.

7396
03:22:35,560 --> 03:22:36,640
I'm ready for Bloodhound.

7397
03:22:37,440 --> 03:22:38,040
All right.

7398
03:22:38,040 --> 03:22:41,120
So, siphon into tree or harvester if we need to survive.

7399
03:22:41,960 --> 03:22:44,860
Bro, I can't believe my ring badge is still not back yet.

7400
03:22:44,860 --> 03:22:46,200
Or do we just contest siphon?

7401
03:22:46,340 --> 03:22:46,920
You know?

7402
03:22:47,920 --> 03:22:48,360
TSM?

7403
03:22:48,560 --> 03:22:50,120
We have the TSM buff.

7404
03:22:50,260 --> 03:22:51,500
We contest siphon, we win.

7405
03:22:51,560 --> 03:22:51,780
No.

7406
03:22:51,780 --> 03:22:52,060
No.

7407
03:22:52,080 --> 03:22:52,560
That's just not...

7408
03:22:52,560 --> 03:22:52,740
No.

7409
03:22:52,740 --> 03:22:54,640
I don't think I wanna do that.

7410
03:22:55,600 --> 03:23:00,440
Guys, I don't know if I want to contest any fucking...

7411
03:23:01,080 --> 03:23:02,780
Why do we not have beacon again?

7412
03:23:29,920 --> 03:23:32,740
I don't know.

7413
03:23:32,780 --> 03:23:33,280
Dude, fuck them.

7414
03:23:33,380 --> 03:23:34,240
They don't get the damage.

7415
03:23:34,780 --> 03:23:36,260
Yeah, nobody gets Siphon.

7416
03:23:36,260 --> 03:23:37,240
We're looting two POIs.

7417
03:23:37,920 --> 03:23:39,380
Wait, there's no point in scanning this yet.

7418
03:23:39,380 --> 03:23:39,940
Stream rate advantage.

7419
03:23:40,900 --> 03:23:42,020
Don't scan until it's done, yeah.

7420
03:23:43,500 --> 03:23:44,080
It's fine.

7421
03:23:44,260 --> 03:23:47,440
I'd actually rather just land Tree anyway because the fucking beacons, dude.

7422
03:23:47,500 --> 03:23:48,920
I'm not going to go Lava Siphon with no beacon.

7423
03:23:48,980 --> 03:23:49,600
It's useless to us.

7424
03:23:50,340 --> 03:23:51,240
What is our luck though?

7425
03:23:51,340 --> 03:23:52,880
Landing Lava Siphon and not getting a beacon is crazy.

7426
03:23:52,920 --> 03:23:54,320
Why is our round two worse than...

7427
03:23:54,320 --> 03:23:57,620
Our luck should be better in round two than round one.

7428
03:23:57,860 --> 03:23:58,160
Never.

7429
03:23:58,280 --> 03:23:59,980
We actually have the worst round fucking...

7430
03:23:59,980 --> 03:24:01,660
The worst round two.

7431
03:24:02,880 --> 03:24:03,200
Ever.

7432
03:24:03,780 --> 03:24:05,660
And my loot is fucking awful.

7433
03:24:06,220 --> 03:24:06,580
Me too.

7434
03:24:06,580 --> 03:24:07,020
Oh my god.

7435
03:24:07,080 --> 03:24:09,100
There's a Devo and a Mastiff.

7436
03:24:09,200 --> 03:24:10,020
I don't like this.

7437
03:24:10,860 --> 03:24:14,420
Does that at least... Does the bot that you shot down at least have a key?

7438
03:24:14,900 --> 03:24:15,220
No.

7439
03:24:15,720 --> 03:24:16,840
I don't think so.

7440
03:24:17,380 --> 03:24:18,340
Oh my god.

7441
03:24:18,420 --> 03:24:19,180
This is a...

7442
03:24:19,180 --> 03:24:20,340
I'm ready to...

7443
03:24:20,340 --> 03:24:21,820
No, it's going to end no name I think.

7444
03:24:22,620 --> 03:24:23,740
I think it's going to end no name or blue bin.

7445
03:24:23,800 --> 03:24:24,180
It's one of the two.

7446
03:24:25,660 --> 03:24:26,060
It's okay.

7447
03:24:26,240 --> 03:24:27,340
I'm ready to rotate.

7448
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:28,860
Yeah, we should rotate.

7449
03:24:28,940 --> 03:24:30,140
I'm going to loot this backside house and we just go.

7450
03:24:30,560 --> 03:24:30,880
Okay.

7451
03:24:30,980 --> 03:24:32,380
Do we go back to Siphon?

7452
03:24:32,800 --> 03:24:33,860
We are going to go to Siphon.

7453
03:24:33,860 --> 03:24:34,080
Okay.

7454
03:24:34,220 --> 03:24:35,320
I'm going to go to the bridge.

7455
03:24:35,860 --> 03:24:36,680
Okay, go for it.

7456
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:37,440
Yeah.

7457
03:24:37,800 --> 03:24:38,580
I'm going to go.

7458
03:24:38,940 --> 03:24:39,580
It's okay.

7459
03:24:39,640 --> 03:24:42,500
If I die, then my teammates are dog shit.

7460
03:24:44,880 --> 03:24:46,740
I don't know if that's how that works out actually.

7461
03:24:49,380 --> 03:24:50,600
That's not how that works.

7462
03:24:51,380 --> 03:24:51,780
Wait.

7463
03:24:52,660 --> 03:24:55,120
Doki looted this whole place and didn't grab the harvester.

7464
03:24:55,940 --> 03:24:56,340
Doki.

7465
03:24:56,500 --> 03:24:57,980
Oh, I didn't see it.

7466
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,220
The evil thing didn't show up.

7467
03:24:59,260 --> 03:25:01,160
The evil thing popped up when I looted it.

7468
03:25:01,220 --> 03:25:01,240
Oh my god.

7469
03:25:01,240 --> 03:25:02,560
She's not locked in.

7470
03:25:02,780 --> 03:25:03,180
Okay.

7471
03:25:03,240 --> 03:25:06,720
You can't say that because the thing did not pop up when I was looting that.

7472
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:07,960
You cannot blame me on that.

7473
03:25:08,140 --> 03:25:10,740
It literally did not open.

7474
03:25:14,540 --> 03:25:16,580
That was not my fault.

7475
03:25:17,060 --> 03:25:18,340
I'm going to go up this zip thingy.

7476
03:25:18,460 --> 03:25:19,800
It literally didn't pop up.

7477
03:25:20,400 --> 03:25:22,040
We're separating pretty far, guys.

7478
03:25:22,480 --> 03:25:24,420
You said there's no one there.

7479
03:25:24,520 --> 03:25:26,040
So I'm fully trusting my idea.

7480
03:25:26,800 --> 03:25:29,240
I said there's probably no one in Lava Siphon.

7481
03:25:30,500 --> 03:25:31,560
I have no idea.

7482
03:25:31,680 --> 03:25:34,580
If I die, Doki will kill me.

7483
03:25:34,760 --> 03:25:36,180
We'll rotate through Siphon.

7484
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:39,300
Meet my call.

7485
03:25:39,300 --> 03:25:40,460
It's not my fault if I die.

7486
03:25:40,660 --> 03:25:42,320
This is South Siphon.

7487
03:25:42,480 --> 03:25:43,960
South Siphon is not looted.

7488
03:25:44,400 --> 03:25:45,640
We're going to rotate through this.

7489
03:25:45,760 --> 03:25:46,700
Oh, wait.

7490
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:50,080
They're far.

7491
03:25:52,060 --> 03:25:52,920
They're far.

7492
03:25:53,600 --> 03:25:54,520
They're over on your launch.

7493
03:25:54,660 --> 03:25:56,940
I have a gold mag for you, Wig.

7494
03:25:57,100 --> 03:25:57,940
Okay, great.

7495
03:25:58,060 --> 03:25:58,740
Thank you so much.

7496
03:25:58,880 --> 03:26:00,180
Do you want to scan the people beacon?

7497
03:26:00,340 --> 03:26:01,880
We should scan stuff.

7498
03:26:02,180 --> 03:26:03,540
I'm going to go to people beacon.

7499
03:26:04,060 --> 03:26:07,020
Wait, I saw a trail this way.

7500
03:26:07,260 --> 03:26:07,980
You see that?

7501
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:09,880
No, I did not look at it.

7502
03:26:10,660 --> 03:26:11,920
There's a red trail over there.

7503
03:26:13,620 --> 03:26:15,020
I'm going to go inside with you.

7504
03:26:16,640 --> 03:26:18,680
I dropped a gold.

7505
03:26:20,160 --> 03:26:20,860
I'll take that.

7506
03:26:20,900 --> 03:26:21,140
Thank you.

7507
03:26:21,180 --> 03:26:21,580
Why not?

7508
03:26:22,580 --> 03:26:23,440
Wait a minute.

7509
03:26:23,760 --> 03:26:25,760
Where did you see that thing?

7510
03:26:25,880 --> 03:26:26,320
Was it in the red?

7511
03:26:27,280 --> 03:26:30,100
I saw a red trail taking me from the red up point.

7512
03:26:30,200 --> 03:26:31,820
And then they flew this direction.

7513
03:26:31,960 --> 03:26:33,860
But I don't know if they flew inside the building or what.

7514
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:35,300
Or they flew this way.

7515
03:26:35,520 --> 03:26:36,400
I couldn't tell.

7516
03:26:36,880 --> 03:26:37,860
I'm going to move up and check.

7517
03:26:40,140 --> 03:26:41,500
I couldn't tell the direction.

7518
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:44,060
I'm heading over.

7519
03:26:44,100 --> 03:26:46,280
I'm going to take lava damage just for you guys.

7520
03:26:46,800 --> 03:26:47,300
Thank you.

7521
03:26:48,960 --> 03:26:49,380
Thank you.

7522
03:26:49,560 --> 03:26:51,340
I tried to get on the car.

7523
03:26:51,360 --> 03:26:51,800
It didn't work.

7524
03:26:52,080 --> 03:26:52,680
It's okay, buddy.

7525
03:26:53,240 --> 03:26:55,120
Let me know when I can do the people scan.

7526
03:26:55,120 --> 03:26:57,300
We're going to figure that out right when you get over here.

7527
03:26:57,400 --> 03:26:58,840
Does someone need a 2x?

7528
03:26:59,720 --> 03:27:01,880
I do if you don't need it.

7529
03:27:02,140 --> 03:27:02,460
Yeah.

7530
03:27:04,280 --> 03:27:04,900
We're good.

7531
03:27:04,980 --> 03:27:06,140
I don't see anyone here.

7532
03:27:07,300 --> 03:27:07,780
Okay.

7533
03:27:09,100 --> 03:27:10,600
I'm going to risk my life.

7534
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:11,600
Do it.

7535
03:27:11,940 --> 03:27:16,220
Because my teammate told me to.

7536
03:27:16,520 --> 03:27:17,300
I got you.

7537
03:27:17,400 --> 03:27:18,000
Trust me.

7538
03:27:18,260 --> 03:27:19,300
Pew pew pew.

7539
03:27:21,680 --> 03:27:22,260
Let's see.

7540
03:27:24,020 --> 03:27:24,500
Nobody.

7541
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:25,760
Oh yeah.

7542
03:27:25,840 --> 03:27:26,980
We need to get going.

7543
03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:29,080
What the fuck is going on at Monument?

7544
03:27:29,580 --> 03:27:30,460
Come through over here.

7545
03:27:30,580 --> 03:27:32,060
We're going to get up through choke right now.

7546
03:27:32,140 --> 03:27:33,080
We're going to get topside guys with choke.

7547
03:27:33,740 --> 03:27:34,680
Lava 7 choke.

7548
03:27:34,840 --> 03:27:35,080
We're good.

7549
03:27:35,940 --> 03:27:38,460
I have four cells.

7550
03:27:39,240 --> 03:27:40,700
I have cells too.

7551
03:27:41,660 --> 03:27:43,060
I have four bats though.

7552
03:27:43,940 --> 03:27:44,500
Blue bag.

7553
03:27:45,880 --> 03:27:48,380
We're going to hit this tower in front of us.

7554
03:27:48,500 --> 03:27:50,420
And we're going to get top of the guys with choke.

7555
03:27:50,540 --> 03:27:51,280
Lava 7 choke.

7556
03:27:53,240 --> 03:27:53,780
I'm ready.

7557
03:27:55,120 --> 03:27:55,360
Go for it.

7558
03:27:55,380 --> 03:27:57,040
Right here.

7559
03:27:57,180 --> 03:28:00,140
I just wanted to look at that bird.

7560
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:02,120
And I was waiting for you anyway.

7561
03:28:02,660 --> 03:28:03,040
Okay.

7562
03:28:07,540 --> 03:28:08,780
I had to go grab a bat.

7563
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:09,580
Okay.

7564
03:28:10,320 --> 03:28:11,440
They're trying to take it from us.

7565
03:28:11,480 --> 03:28:12,920
Where are they?

7566
03:28:13,160 --> 03:28:13,820
They're down below.

7567
03:28:16,320 --> 03:28:17,080
We can't.

7568
03:28:18,840 --> 03:28:19,740
God damn it.

7569
03:28:20,080 --> 03:28:21,760
Where did they come from?

7570
03:28:22,660 --> 03:28:24,140
We need to move in a little bit more.

7571
03:28:25,360 --> 03:28:26,460
I want to get to zone.

7572
03:28:26,520 --> 03:28:27,680
We're not going to be able to get to zone from here.

7573
03:28:27,740 --> 03:28:28,340
That's so fucked.

7574
03:28:28,480 --> 03:28:30,340
We can go around from the geyser side.

7575
03:28:31,580 --> 03:28:32,120
Let's see what they do.

7576
03:28:32,740 --> 03:28:33,600
There's a team in there right now.

7577
03:28:35,020 --> 03:28:35,580
That sucks.

7578
03:28:35,740 --> 03:28:37,220
Let's see if this team in lava 7 choke moves.

7579
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:41,140
I don't know if they're going to hold it or not.

7580
03:28:41,260 --> 03:28:41,420
Damn.

7581
03:28:41,520 --> 03:28:42,600
We were like half a second earlier.

7582
03:28:44,680 --> 03:28:45,840
Where's the geyser team?

7583
03:28:46,440 --> 03:28:47,620
They're next to geyser.

7584
03:28:47,640 --> 03:28:48,660
The actual geyser itself.

7585
03:28:48,660 --> 03:28:49,200
They were in there.

7586
03:28:51,160 --> 03:28:54,360
I think this team would have moved up a little bit.

7587
03:28:54,480 --> 03:28:55,340
We're going to go up here and scan.

7588
03:28:55,520 --> 03:28:56,800
I think this team is not here anymore.

7589
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:57,720
They moved up.

7590
03:28:57,900 --> 03:28:59,000
They left the choke completely.

7591
03:29:00,200 --> 03:29:01,940
We're going to walk up and scan.

7592
03:29:03,480 --> 03:29:05,240
Get to right here and scan.

7593
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:08,240
If they're up there, stay on your mountainside and you're good to go.

7594
03:29:09,320 --> 03:29:09,640
Scanning?

7595
03:29:10,380 --> 03:29:10,700
Nope.

7596
03:29:11,400 --> 03:29:12,160
Take, take, take.

7597
03:29:13,180 --> 03:29:13,860
I'm going up.

7598
03:29:13,860 --> 03:29:14,420
I'm going up.

7599
03:29:15,880 --> 03:29:17,800
We'll let my IGL go up further.

7600
03:29:18,420 --> 03:29:19,380
Yeah, let me go first.

7601
03:29:19,660 --> 03:29:20,800
I see a rez.

7602
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:22,060
We're fine right now.

7603
03:29:22,700 --> 03:29:23,620
53 seconds ago.

7604
03:29:23,700 --> 03:29:25,060
There's a gas canister here.

7605
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:26,900
There's going to be a team on the right side.

7606
03:29:27,200 --> 03:29:28,100
There's definitely a team over here.

7607
03:29:28,380 --> 03:29:29,080
I got scanned.

7608
03:29:31,020 --> 03:29:33,560
I'm just going to full heal this.

7609
03:29:34,260 --> 03:29:34,880
Go for it.

7610
03:29:36,380 --> 03:29:37,580
We have a redeploy.

7611
03:29:37,740 --> 03:29:38,600
We want to use it.

7612
03:29:39,040 --> 03:29:40,340
I don't know where this is going to pull.

7613
03:29:40,460 --> 03:29:40,980
This might pull back.

7614
03:29:41,260 --> 03:29:41,880
We'll stay here for now.

7615
03:29:43,860 --> 03:29:44,860
We'll watch front then.

7616
03:29:45,580 --> 03:29:46,400
Yeah, you watch front.

7617
03:29:46,420 --> 03:29:47,480
Just make sure you don't get ratted on.

7618
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:48,360
They can 100% creep up.

7619
03:29:49,720 --> 03:29:51,120
We just play from here and we can evade.

7620
03:29:51,240 --> 03:29:52,260
We can valkyrie delay if we need to.

7621
03:29:53,640 --> 03:29:55,720
It's not a bad spot because this could be a wonky pull.

7622
03:29:55,840 --> 03:29:56,840
I don't really trust this pull at all.

7623
03:29:57,440 --> 03:29:57,720
Okay.

7624
03:29:58,520 --> 03:29:59,780
I was waiting until they scan.

7625
03:30:01,100 --> 03:30:02,320
Should be fine.

7626
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,980
Also, if the zone does pull down, I'm pretty sure big house is not taking it.

7627
03:30:06,360 --> 03:30:06,880
Just to point out.

7628
03:30:08,380 --> 03:30:09,700
Temba, you keep looking behind us down below.

7629
03:30:09,780 --> 03:30:10,700
Yeah, I'm looking siphon.

7630
03:30:11,480 --> 03:30:12,680
Yeah, I'm going to scope this scene out.

7631
03:30:14,100 --> 03:30:14,980
Yeah, just keep on scanning.

7632
03:30:15,100 --> 03:30:16,840
There is a team siphon.

7633
03:30:19,200 --> 03:30:21,020
I'm looking at monument side too.

7634
03:30:23,160 --> 03:30:23,480
They slid down.

7635
03:30:23,480 --> 03:30:24,620
We hold these kids down no matter what.

7636
03:30:24,720 --> 03:30:25,020
That's for sure.

7637
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:26,620
Wait, someone just hit a beacon.

7638
03:30:27,160 --> 03:30:28,000
What the hell was that noise?

7639
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:28,840
Someone just hit a ring console.

7640
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:30,400
Right here, what the fuck?

7641
03:30:32,600 --> 03:30:33,920
Is he just in the open?

7642
03:30:34,340 --> 03:30:34,840
I don't know.

7643
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:35,760
He just hit a ring console.

7644
03:30:36,700 --> 03:30:38,040
Careful, Temba.

7645
03:30:38,140 --> 03:30:38,880
We backed up.

7646
03:30:39,580 --> 03:30:40,660
Who are we by the way?

7647
03:30:41,280 --> 03:30:42,700
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck that was.

7648
03:30:42,740 --> 03:30:44,680
I just heard a ring console and that guy was in front of me.

7649
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:44,980
What?

7650
03:30:45,200 --> 03:30:46,840
What a bug.

7651
03:30:47,980 --> 03:30:48,640
Yeah, you're good.

7652
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:50,840
They are going to blue bin.

7653
03:30:50,880 --> 03:30:51,200
We are fine.

7654
03:30:51,940 --> 03:30:53,220
They are leaving us.

7655
03:30:54,380 --> 03:30:55,340
Are you still looking?

7656
03:30:55,440 --> 03:30:56,300
Okay, you are still looking behind.

7657
03:30:56,960 --> 03:30:57,280
Yeah.

7658
03:30:58,080 --> 03:30:58,960
I see them.

7659
03:31:01,300 --> 03:31:03,420
What the fuck is this spot you are trying to play, buddy?

7660
03:31:03,580 --> 03:31:04,120
Just leave.

7661
03:31:04,920 --> 03:31:05,520
Leave us.

7662
03:31:05,520 --> 03:31:06,040
We are content.

7663
03:31:06,500 --> 03:31:06,780
Leave.

7664
03:31:07,480 --> 03:31:08,880
I don't know why they are trying to hold you.

7665
03:31:08,980 --> 03:31:09,880
This spot is so bad.

7666
03:31:10,500 --> 03:31:12,540
Unless they think there is someone behind.

7667
03:31:12,660 --> 03:31:13,220
Remember, this is round two.

7668
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:14,720
Oh my god.

7669
03:31:14,940 --> 03:31:15,300
Okay, one sec.

7670
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:16,540
I heal.

7671
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:18,620
Watch out for them.

7672
03:31:19,160 --> 03:31:20,500
Temba, focus your attention on the front side.

7673
03:31:20,600 --> 03:31:20,920
I'll look back.

7674
03:31:21,160 --> 03:31:22,080
They are waiting still.

7675
03:31:22,660 --> 03:31:22,940
Yeah.

7676
03:31:24,280 --> 03:31:26,460
You have to step a little bit more and keep scanning and show presence.

7677
03:31:26,560 --> 03:31:27,040
No, no, no.

7678
03:31:30,460 --> 03:31:32,060
How are they fucking pushing this?

7679
03:31:32,460 --> 03:31:33,120
I'm batting this.

7680
03:31:34,280 --> 03:31:35,340
What am I watching right now?

7681
03:31:36,040 --> 03:31:36,880
There is someone behind us.

7682
03:31:36,900 --> 03:31:37,460
What the fuck?

7683
03:31:37,580 --> 03:31:39,480
Bro, we are getting griefed, man.

7684
03:31:39,800 --> 03:31:41,320
Come to my corner.

7685
03:31:41,680 --> 03:31:45,220
What am I fucking watching right now?

7686
03:31:45,860 --> 03:31:47,400
We just got Caustic ulted.

7687
03:31:47,640 --> 03:31:49,000
Am I saving Slyre?

7688
03:31:49,620 --> 03:31:50,760
Get the ADR.

7689
03:31:50,800 --> 03:31:51,580
We are fucked.

7690
03:31:51,720 --> 03:31:53,740
We are so dead.

7691
03:31:54,280 --> 03:31:54,580
No.

7692
03:31:56,700 --> 03:31:57,820
Just hide.

7693
03:31:58,100 --> 03:32:01,320
There is another team pushing forward.

7694
03:32:01,520 --> 03:32:02,240
Just hide.

7695
03:32:02,260 --> 03:32:02,940
You don't exist.

7696
03:32:03,300 --> 03:32:04,200
You don't exist.

7697
03:32:06,040 --> 03:32:06,760
I'm getting griefed.

7698
03:32:06,940 --> 03:32:08,300
I'm getting griefed.

7699
03:32:12,730 --> 03:32:14,870
No, genuinely, what the fuck am I playing, bro?

7700
03:32:15,030 --> 03:32:15,910
Oh my god.

7701
03:32:16,070 --> 03:32:16,810
I don't know.

7702
03:32:20,530 --> 03:32:21,730
It's another time for it.

7703
03:32:21,750 --> 03:32:23,550
These kids are so fucking bad, man.

7704
03:32:23,750 --> 03:32:25,950
Bro, just save the house.

7705
03:32:26,050 --> 03:32:27,230
That's your home now, Temba.

7706
03:32:27,570 --> 03:32:29,170
Oh my god, bro.

7707
03:32:29,270 --> 03:32:30,510
This is the shit that tells me.

7708
03:32:30,570 --> 03:32:31,630
Just don't pick time to chill.

7709
03:32:31,710 --> 03:32:31,730
Oh my god.

7710
03:32:32,830 --> 03:32:33,530
Bro, what the fuck?

7711
03:32:34,230 --> 03:32:34,910
Don't worry, guys.

7712
03:32:34,970 --> 03:32:35,810
I can get your banner.

7713
03:32:36,070 --> 03:32:38,310
I can get your banner and then evac tower.

7714
03:32:38,850 --> 03:32:39,530
No, no.

7715
03:32:39,610 --> 03:32:39,910
This is...

7716
03:32:39,910 --> 03:32:41,010
Banner, evac, and I'm good.

7717
03:32:41,410 --> 03:32:42,990
And I have a mobi right here.

7718
03:32:43,190 --> 03:32:44,370
Just get us one point.

7719
03:32:44,530 --> 03:32:46,150
Just get us one point.

7720
03:32:46,690 --> 03:32:49,010
I actually cannot believe what I'm talking about.

7721
03:32:49,250 --> 03:32:52,450
How is that team able to push from blue bins?

7722
03:32:52,590 --> 03:32:54,010
Why are they pushing from blue bins?

7723
03:32:54,110 --> 03:32:55,130
What are you doing?

7724
03:32:55,510 --> 03:32:58,970
These are why these kids stay hard to challenge a circuit for 98 years.

7725
03:32:59,230 --> 03:33:00,230
These are why these kids stay hard to challenge a circuit for 98 years.

7726
03:33:00,230 --> 03:33:01,030
Holy fuck, dude.

7727
03:33:01,350 --> 03:33:03,490
Oh my god.

7728
03:33:04,490 --> 03:33:05,510
Oh my god.

7729
03:33:07,130 --> 03:33:08,750
How is this possible?

7730
03:33:08,750 --> 03:33:12,450
How in the world are they able to push up like that?

7731
03:33:12,530 --> 03:33:12,990
That is crazy.

7732
03:33:13,470 --> 03:33:15,590
Temba, is that P20 I see in your hand?

7733
03:33:16,270 --> 03:33:17,470
Yeah, I was looking for a re.

7734
03:33:17,650 --> 03:33:19,170
Yeah, I was looking for a re.

7735
03:33:20,090 --> 03:33:21,130
Yo, I have hammer points.

7736
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:21,830
It's okay.

7737
03:33:21,850 --> 03:33:22,270
I believe.

7738
03:33:22,430 --> 03:33:22,810
I believe.

7739
03:33:22,870 --> 03:33:23,910
No one's gonna go in your house.

7740
03:33:24,430 --> 03:33:25,590
There's no way.

7741
03:33:26,670 --> 03:33:27,490
Just stay there.

7742
03:33:27,590 --> 03:33:29,450
Don't even fucking get out of...

7743
03:33:29,450 --> 03:33:30,130
Don't even leave.

7744
03:33:30,250 --> 03:33:31,130
Just stay there.

7745
03:33:31,150 --> 03:33:31,690
There's no way.

7746
03:33:31,690 --> 03:33:33,210
Oh my god, it pulls right on top.

7747
03:33:34,150 --> 03:33:35,130
Does it pull on the choke?

7748
03:33:35,610 --> 03:33:37,230
Oh my god, it does, bro.

7749
03:33:37,410 --> 03:33:38,250
It pulls out here.

7750
03:33:38,750 --> 03:33:40,430
And we just got grief so hard.

7751
03:33:40,430 --> 03:33:42,870
You know the old zone with the pills and shit?

7752
03:33:43,070 --> 03:33:43,230
Yeah.

7753
03:33:44,490 --> 03:33:45,490
It's gonna be the blue pens one.

7754
03:33:45,730 --> 03:33:46,950
We literally called it perfectly.

7755
03:33:47,150 --> 03:33:49,050
And we just got grief from two fucking...

7756
03:33:49,050 --> 03:33:50,530
Oh my god.

7757
03:33:50,670 --> 03:33:52,530
We got grief so hard.

7758
03:33:52,730 --> 03:33:54,750
I think it was the nade.

7759
03:33:54,750 --> 03:33:56,810
They saw you got naded and they're like, this is it.

7760
03:33:56,950 --> 03:33:57,730
This is it.

7761
03:33:58,690 --> 03:34:01,490
In any good lobby, that team just cannot move.

7762
03:34:01,770 --> 03:34:03,490
They just cannot push from blue pens.

7763
03:34:03,750 --> 03:34:04,470
Like, it doesn't make...

7764
03:34:04,470 --> 03:34:05,750
Yeah, they got grief for that.

7765
03:34:07,090 --> 03:34:08,670
Let's just hope that team doesn't...

7766
03:34:08,670 --> 03:34:10,610
How many gas cans can you have out?

7767
03:34:11,210 --> 03:34:11,650
Six.

7768
03:34:12,850 --> 03:34:13,590
Wait, really?

7769
03:34:14,550 --> 03:34:15,270
I'm maxed out.

7770
03:34:15,510 --> 03:34:19,010
Okay, wouldn't it be funny to just throw a nade and activate all six of these?

7771
03:34:19,730 --> 03:34:20,070
Okay, wouldn't it be funny to just throw a nade and activate all six of these?

7772
03:34:20,070 --> 03:34:20,630
That's why... yup.

7773
03:34:21,530 --> 03:34:23,890
That's why I have a nade for counter-activate.

7774
03:34:27,470 --> 03:34:29,230
That time when we had...

7775
03:34:29,230 --> 03:34:32,690
We had Wigg as the rat and now it's Tempu's time to shine.

7776
03:34:32,730 --> 03:34:34,810
All you need to do is get to 15th.

7777
03:34:34,850 --> 03:34:35,730
All you need to do is get to 15th.

7778
03:34:35,750 --> 03:34:36,090
Plus one.

7779
03:34:36,410 --> 03:34:37,710
No, I have a nade.

7780
03:34:37,790 --> 03:34:39,010
I'm gonna win.

7781
03:34:39,650 --> 03:34:40,810
I believe in you.

7782
03:34:40,830 --> 03:34:44,390
I'm gonna get to third and then I'm gonna nade them as they 3P each other.

7783
03:34:44,850 --> 03:34:45,590
Oh no.

7784
03:34:45,810 --> 03:34:46,970
Guys, where did that scan come from?

7785
03:34:47,270 --> 03:34:48,270
I have no idea, guys.

7786
03:34:48,310 --> 03:34:49,630
I have no fucking clue.

7787
03:34:49,950 --> 03:34:50,930
Are they behind you?

7788
03:34:51,030 --> 03:34:53,430
While we were fucking...

7789
03:34:54,890 --> 03:34:57,590
strategizing the one Bloodhound scan to end it all.

7790
03:34:57,770 --> 03:34:59,290
To find out you're a rat.

7791
03:35:02,450 --> 03:35:03,710
You're so fucked.

7792
03:35:03,790 --> 03:35:04,950
No, you're a rat, bro.

7793
03:35:05,910 --> 03:35:07,330
Wait, I can... I can evac out of here.

7794
03:35:07,330 --> 03:35:07,950
You got this, man.

7795
03:35:08,010 --> 03:35:08,690
Another pause for the rest of the year.

7796
03:35:09,710 --> 03:35:11,030
Guys, we need one more team to die.

7797
03:35:11,170 --> 03:35:12,430
One more team to die.

7798
03:35:12,470 --> 03:35:12,810
One more.

7799
03:35:12,810 --> 03:35:13,290
One more.

7800
03:35:13,410 --> 03:35:13,790
That's all we need.

7801
03:35:14,450 --> 03:35:15,650
I'm doing the top 10 out of you, guys.

7802
03:35:16,350 --> 03:35:17,790
That's gotta be from up there, right?

7803
03:35:18,050 --> 03:35:19,530
It came from behind, didn't it?

7804
03:35:20,830 --> 03:35:22,230
I swear it came from behind.

7805
03:35:23,510 --> 03:35:25,050
I wish we could ping when we're dead.

7806
03:35:25,810 --> 03:35:26,870
I wish that was a feature.

7807
03:35:30,410 --> 03:35:32,370
Maybe they'll miss the scan if I'm wrong and just died.

7808
03:35:33,570 --> 03:35:34,470
It's easy, dogs, bro.

7809
03:35:34,490 --> 03:35:34,810
I feel it.

7810
03:35:35,750 --> 03:35:36,350
I can feel it.

7811
03:35:36,370 --> 03:35:37,630
I can feel that top 15.

7812
03:35:38,270 --> 03:35:38,970
I do too.

7813
03:35:39,170 --> 03:35:39,550
Yeah, yeah.

7814
03:35:39,570 --> 03:35:41,770
We just need... we literally need one team.

7815
03:35:41,890 --> 03:35:44,590
One more team to die while this recloses.

7816
03:35:44,910 --> 03:35:44,970
I'm not gonna push you in here, bro.

7817
03:35:44,990 --> 03:35:45,810
I would not push you.

7818
03:35:45,890 --> 03:35:47,170
Like, I'll be real.

7819
03:35:47,290 --> 03:35:48,090
Seven barrels deep.

7820
03:35:48,510 --> 03:35:49,630
A fucking fart bomb.

7821
03:35:49,870 --> 03:35:51,230
Like, I need... I think you get this top 15.

7822
03:35:52,170 --> 03:35:52,650
Oh, yes!

7823
03:35:52,810 --> 03:35:53,170
Let's go!

7824
03:35:53,890 --> 03:35:55,630
I feel like that team might push you.

7825
03:35:55,690 --> 03:35:57,210
Oh, that's two different bloodhounds.

7826
03:35:57,570 --> 03:35:57,970
Okay.

7827
03:35:58,430 --> 03:35:59,730
Oh my god.

7828
03:36:00,090 --> 03:36:01,570
It pulls there.

7829
03:36:02,250 --> 03:36:08,710
As soon as these guys pass me, I can... as soon as these guys walk out past me, I can late evac from out here.

7830
03:36:09,970 --> 03:36:11,910
And then just go in a circle.

7831
03:36:12,150 --> 03:36:12,730
Holy shit.

7832
03:36:12,770 --> 03:36:13,990
This is a terrible zone.

7833
03:36:14,270 --> 03:36:14,990
This is literally open.

7834
03:36:16,050 --> 03:36:18,690
Well, to be fair, the team Bluebeard should have been dead.

7835
03:36:18,850 --> 03:36:22,490
The fucking Geyser team should have shot them the whole fucking time they're walking up on us.

7836
03:36:22,510 --> 03:36:23,130
Like, what are they doing?

7837
03:36:23,230 --> 03:36:24,130
Are they touching themselves?

7838
03:36:24,450 --> 03:36:24,910
Like, I don't understand.

7839
03:36:25,550 --> 03:36:28,430
Bro, the homies gotta, you know, relieve the other homies' stress.

7840
03:36:28,610 --> 03:36:30,190
Yeah, they're just jerking each other off.

7841
03:36:30,190 --> 03:36:31,190
These guys are running past.

7842
03:36:31,370 --> 03:36:32,390
You need ultis.

7843
03:36:32,410 --> 03:36:32,910
You need ultis, Tebow.

7844
03:36:33,010 --> 03:36:33,830
You need to stay alive for top 12.

7845
03:36:34,030 --> 03:36:34,390
No, no, no.

7846
03:36:34,490 --> 03:36:35,770
I think they're running past.

7847
03:36:36,730 --> 03:36:38,150
They are not running past.

7848
03:36:38,190 --> 03:36:39,170
They are not running past.

7849
03:36:39,750 --> 03:36:40,830
Oh, good, bitch.

7850
03:36:41,250 --> 03:36:42,490
Yeah, fuck them up, Tebow.

7851
03:36:42,550 --> 03:36:43,170
Top 10, baby.

7852
03:36:43,250 --> 03:36:43,510
Come on.

7853
03:36:43,530 --> 03:36:44,050
Yeah, yeah.

7854
03:36:44,110 --> 03:36:44,750
Fuck you.

7855
03:36:44,890 --> 03:36:46,270
I have 18 million barrels.

7856
03:36:46,370 --> 03:36:47,270
You can't get in here.

7857
03:36:48,750 --> 03:36:49,090
Oh.

7858
03:36:49,090 --> 03:36:50,070
I don't know, man.

7859
03:36:50,930 --> 03:36:51,470
Top 10.

7860
03:36:51,530 --> 03:36:51,850
You're so close.

7861
03:36:51,870 --> 03:36:52,210
Keep barreling.

7862
03:36:52,290 --> 03:36:52,630
Keep barreling.

7863
03:36:52,670 --> 03:36:53,170
Keep barreling.

7864
03:36:53,270 --> 03:36:55,070
Just do like a non-stop barrel act.

7865
03:36:55,530 --> 03:36:56,210
Yes, 100%.

7866
03:36:56,210 --> 03:36:56,790
There's no way.

7867
03:36:57,410 --> 03:36:58,070
That's your new door.

7868
03:36:58,650 --> 03:36:59,650
This is the barrel act of 2024.

7869
03:37:00,190 --> 03:37:01,230
Oh, my God.

7870
03:37:01,270 --> 03:37:04,530
Oh, my God.

7871
03:37:04,610 --> 03:37:06,390
Are you gonna keep doing that?

7872
03:37:06,450 --> 03:37:06,830
Nice.

7873
03:37:06,950 --> 03:37:07,470
Nice.

7874
03:37:07,750 --> 03:37:08,270
Top 10.

7875
03:37:09,670 --> 03:37:10,190
Yes.

7876
03:37:10,810 --> 03:37:11,750
Top 10.

7877
03:37:13,430 --> 03:37:14,090
Top 10.

7878
03:37:14,570 --> 03:37:16,390
I fucking hate challenger circuit.

7879
03:37:16,550 --> 03:37:17,090
Good shit, bro.

7880
03:37:17,170 --> 03:37:17,610
Good job.

7881
03:37:17,810 --> 03:37:18,850
Well played, man.

7882
03:37:18,890 --> 03:37:19,270
Good job.

7883
03:37:19,350 --> 03:37:21,330
I wouldn't know if this team is gonna...

7884
03:37:21,330 --> 03:37:22,650
Oh, they stole your evac.

7885
03:37:23,530 --> 03:37:25,010
They're stealing my plan.

7886
03:37:25,310 --> 03:37:26,570
They stole your plan.

7887
03:37:26,970 --> 03:37:29,230
I hope they die off this evac.

7888
03:37:29,490 --> 03:37:29,790
Yeah.

7889
03:37:30,590 --> 03:37:32,890
I hope you fucking fly into a mountain and die.

7890
03:37:33,030 --> 03:37:33,910
Oh, my God.

7891
03:37:34,050 --> 03:37:35,270
You could've died there.

7892
03:37:35,390 --> 03:37:36,850
If that was you, you would've died.

7893
03:37:37,090 --> 03:37:37,770
You would've died.

7894
03:37:37,770 --> 03:37:38,810
You would've died.

7895
03:37:38,870 --> 03:37:39,650
There's no way.

7896
03:37:40,030 --> 03:37:42,330
Bro, if you lived, we would've been top 6.

7897
03:37:42,330 --> 03:37:43,690
We got full sent on from fucking...

7898
03:37:43,690 --> 03:37:45,870
We were playing this choke here.

7899
03:37:46,310 --> 03:37:47,830
We got one team came up here.

7900
03:37:47,870 --> 03:37:49,030
Two teams came up here.

7901
03:37:49,130 --> 03:37:50,410
And then we just got fucking full sent.

7902
03:37:50,410 --> 03:37:51,230
That could've been you.

7903
03:37:52,090 --> 03:37:53,350
They stole your evac.

7904
03:37:53,670 --> 03:37:55,490
That's actually a really good spot where they landed, bro.

7905
03:37:55,490 --> 03:37:55,930
I'm not gonna lie.

7906
03:37:56,030 --> 03:37:56,550
That was a good job.

7907
03:37:56,750 --> 03:37:58,130
That could've been us, man.

7908
03:37:58,130 --> 03:37:59,350
That could've been fucking tempo.

7909
03:38:01,870 --> 03:38:02,870
We got top 10.

7910
03:38:02,990 --> 03:38:04,130
Was that two points for top 10?

7911
03:38:05,370 --> 03:38:06,230
I think so.

7912
03:38:06,590 --> 03:38:07,030
Nice.

7913
03:38:07,030 --> 03:38:07,890
We got plus 2.

7914
03:38:08,050 --> 03:38:09,090
Okay, last game, guys.

7915
03:38:09,210 --> 03:38:11,010
We need to have a really good game.

7916
03:38:11,050 --> 03:38:12,250
Yeah, that's for damn sure.

7917
03:38:12,670 --> 03:38:14,510
Or I don't think we're making it.

7918
03:38:14,590 --> 03:38:16,610
Are we ever not gonna get griefed in round 2?

7919
03:38:16,650 --> 03:38:17,530
Or what the fuck going on?

7920
03:38:17,970 --> 03:38:19,770
Our round 2 is never lucky.

7921
03:38:20,210 --> 03:38:21,750
We're lucky in round 1.

7922
03:38:21,790 --> 03:38:23,790
The fucking round that never matters.

7923
03:38:24,290 --> 03:38:24,730
Like...

7924
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:26,750
This is bullshit.

7925
03:38:27,170 --> 03:38:28,330
This is bullshit, dude.

7926
03:38:28,910 --> 03:38:30,430
I call for a recount.

7927
03:38:30,550 --> 03:38:31,170
I demand a revote.

7928
03:38:31,350 --> 03:38:34,030
Yeah, I demand this particular game to be reset.

7929
03:38:34,370 --> 03:38:34,970
I agree.

7930
03:38:35,550 --> 03:38:38,790
I think they bring us back to the exact same circle.

7931
03:38:38,930 --> 03:38:39,670
Restart the game.

7932
03:38:39,730 --> 03:38:40,230
We go from there.

7933
03:38:40,350 --> 03:38:41,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7934
03:38:41,550 --> 03:38:44,430
Guys, do you not want more content?

7935
03:38:44,550 --> 03:38:48,210
We're literally boosting the Challenger Circuit views right now.

7936
03:38:49,530 --> 03:38:50,050
We're literally boosting the Challenger Circuit views right now.

7937
03:38:50,050 --> 03:38:50,090
We're literally boosting the Challenger Circuit views right now.

7938
03:38:50,090 --> 03:38:51,070
Are you fucking kidding me?

7939
03:38:52,190 --> 03:38:54,610
Are you fucking kidding me?

7940
03:38:56,510 --> 03:38:57,710
You guys, like...

7941
03:38:57,710 --> 03:38:58,490
I bet you...

7942
03:38:58,490 --> 03:38:59,190
Why do you keep doing this?

7943
03:38:59,190 --> 03:39:00,490
Don't you want the content to be good?

7944
03:39:00,650 --> 03:39:04,770
I bet you I have the most viewers on YouTube right now for Challenger Circuit.

7945
03:39:05,090 --> 03:39:07,610
You need me for the YouTube representation.

7946
03:39:08,390 --> 03:39:09,190
Actually, though...

7947
03:39:10,650 --> 03:39:12,070
We need you for the viewership.

7948
03:39:12,910 --> 03:39:13,470
Come on!

7949
03:39:14,350 --> 03:39:15,950
Come on, Tease!

7950
03:39:16,010 --> 03:39:17,010
You gotta let us...

7951
03:39:17,010 --> 03:39:19,590
We're here to save Apex!

7952
03:39:19,650 --> 03:39:21,690
So we can go Syphon, by the way.

7953
03:39:22,050 --> 03:39:23,250
Yeah, we can.

7954
03:39:23,390 --> 03:39:24,590
But if there's no beacon, I don't even know what to do.

7955
03:39:24,610 --> 03:39:25,050
I just wanna go there.

7956
03:39:25,450 --> 03:39:26,070
That's true.

7957
03:39:26,230 --> 03:39:26,570
Alright.

7958
03:39:27,030 --> 03:39:28,430
So we've got two POIs.

7959
03:39:29,070 --> 03:39:30,430
Yeah, we have two POIs.

7960
03:39:32,430 --> 03:39:34,450
Realistically, this last game should be good for us.

7961
03:39:35,150 --> 03:39:36,430
All I'm saying...

7962
03:39:36,430 --> 03:39:39,030
Let us through to round three and we'll give you more content.

7963
03:39:39,410 --> 03:39:41,570
Best case scenario, we're in 12th.

7964
03:39:42,170 --> 03:39:42,590
Okay.

7965
03:39:42,850 --> 03:39:44,370
That's definitely not gonna happen, for sure.

7966
03:39:44,390 --> 03:39:44,950
That's not gonna happen.

7967
03:39:45,190 --> 03:39:48,630
We'll probably stay in 14th, which means we need a 10-point game.

7968
03:39:48,870 --> 03:39:49,290
Okay.

7969
03:39:49,530 --> 03:39:50,610
Alright, that's doable.

7970
03:39:52,070 --> 03:39:53,450
That's second place and one kill.

7971
03:39:55,130 --> 03:39:56,870
Oh, he still had a conduit?

7972
03:39:57,310 --> 03:40:00,190
Oh, and then he still hit himself.

7973
03:40:01,970 --> 03:40:03,090
Oh my god.

7974
03:40:03,290 --> 03:40:04,090
Oh, and then he...

7975
03:40:04,090 --> 03:40:04,150
Oh no!

7976
03:40:07,990 --> 03:40:09,730
Bro, this guy has a 4k badge.

7977
03:40:09,830 --> 03:40:10,490
What the fuck?

7978
03:40:11,090 --> 03:40:12,990
Bro, what the fuck am I watching?

7979
03:40:13,190 --> 03:40:14,310
Oh, yo.

7980
03:40:14,430 --> 03:40:15,590
You know what I should've done?

7981
03:40:15,770 --> 03:40:16,150
What?

7982
03:40:16,230 --> 03:40:19,150
When that team was coming in, I should've given them the evac.

7983
03:40:19,830 --> 03:40:20,810
Yeah, they would've left.

7984
03:40:21,050 --> 03:40:22,030
And then they would've left.

7985
03:40:22,030 --> 03:40:23,670
And then I would've been like, alright, see you guys.

7986
03:40:24,090 --> 03:40:25,590
Yeah, but then you would've just died on the walk up.

7987
03:40:25,750 --> 03:40:27,750
Yeah, you would've died on the walk up, not gonna lie.

7988
03:40:28,070 --> 03:40:29,030
You needed that evac.

7989
03:40:30,090 --> 03:40:31,610
Oh no, no, I'd take it after them.

7990
03:40:31,710 --> 03:40:33,470
I'd pretend like we're four people on a team.

7991
03:40:34,510 --> 03:40:35,610
I should've colluded.

7992
03:40:35,770 --> 03:40:36,850
I feel like you'd be the one who...

7993
03:40:36,850 --> 03:40:38,850
Yeah, all four of us should've taken the balloon.

7994
03:40:39,090 --> 03:40:41,370
I should've just thrown it out for them and then been like...

7995
03:40:42,450 --> 03:40:42,810
Truce.

7996
03:40:43,010 --> 03:40:46,590
Yeah, but I think if you just threw it out for them, the other team would've shot the evac.

7997
03:40:46,710 --> 03:40:49,930
Because there was no way they would've fucking not shot it.

7998
03:40:49,930 --> 03:40:51,870
It would've been a truce, what do you mean?

7999
03:40:52,290 --> 03:40:54,210
No, I meant the other team.

8000
03:40:54,590 --> 03:40:55,630
The other, other team.

8001
03:40:55,870 --> 03:40:57,530
Yeah, but then they would see four of us and get scared.

8002
03:40:58,030 --> 03:41:01,390
No, they'll see the fucking evac tower and shoot it down.

8003
03:41:01,630 --> 03:41:02,670
Like, what?

8004
03:41:04,230 --> 03:41:05,010
I'm confused.

8005
03:41:05,510 --> 03:41:06,610
Okay, jeez.

8006
03:41:11,690 --> 03:41:12,970
This is it.

8007
03:41:13,090 --> 03:41:14,030
Oh my god.

8008
03:41:14,570 --> 03:41:17,830
I'm still watching that conduit do some amazing things.

8009
03:41:19,930 --> 03:41:21,570
Oh, conduit 838326?

8010
03:41:22,010 --> 03:41:25,030
Guys, I thought that we were a world's edge team.

8011
03:41:25,110 --> 03:41:25,990
What happened to us?

8012
03:41:26,210 --> 03:41:26,790
We used to be...

8013
03:41:26,790 --> 03:41:28,390
We just got griefed, guys.

8014
03:41:28,650 --> 03:41:30,910
Teams around us have no brain cells.

8015
03:41:31,090 --> 03:41:32,430
I called the zone perfectly.

8016
03:41:32,730 --> 03:41:34,530
I like, literally knew exactly where it was going.

8017
03:41:34,730 --> 03:41:40,150
And we had Geyser choke doing a fucking team jerk off into the fucking shooting squad.

8018
03:41:41,190 --> 03:41:42,750
We should've been in a house.

8019
03:41:43,870 --> 03:41:45,850
We should've probably threw the roof for them though, bro.

8020
03:41:45,890 --> 03:41:46,310
I'm gonna be honest.

8021
03:41:47,970 --> 03:41:53,930
If that team that was on those boxes, the blue bins, lived, I swear to god, I'd be so sad.

8022
03:41:54,130 --> 03:41:54,650
I'm pretty sure they did.

8023
03:41:54,950 --> 03:41:55,530
They did?

8024
03:41:55,770 --> 03:41:56,810
No one pushed them?

8025
03:41:57,270 --> 03:41:57,630
No.

8026
03:41:57,930 --> 03:41:59,250
Geyser choke did nothing.

8027
03:41:59,410 --> 03:42:00,090
Those guys were awful.

8028
03:42:00,170 --> 03:42:01,130
Geyser didn't do anything.

8029
03:42:01,610 --> 03:42:04,290
Yeah, but I'm thinking like the other team behind them.

8030
03:42:04,650 --> 03:42:05,430
That's what you would think.

8031
03:42:05,470 --> 03:42:05,870
For sure.

8032
03:42:05,890 --> 03:42:06,570
No, for sure.

8033
03:42:06,630 --> 03:42:07,230
They just don't.

8034
03:42:07,290 --> 03:42:08,150
They don't know what they're doing.

8035
03:42:08,330 --> 03:42:09,230
Yeah, that's right.

8036
03:42:09,650 --> 03:42:10,350
That's what he meant.

8037
03:42:11,910 --> 03:42:13,750
I have no idea who the...

8038
03:42:13,750 --> 03:42:14,270
Okay.

8039
03:42:15,670 --> 03:42:17,170
Oh wait, no, that is them.

8040
03:42:17,430 --> 03:42:18,690
Wait, no, it's a Wraith team.

8041
03:42:18,750 --> 03:42:20,130
Wraith Caustic Blood Hound team.

8042
03:42:21,190 --> 03:42:23,670
I haven't seen a Wraith Caustic Blood Hound team at all.

8043
03:42:27,680 --> 03:42:32,560
Someone was like in my chat, what if it's the TSM tag that's giving you the scarce?

8044
03:42:32,880 --> 03:42:35,340
Okay, let's remove our TSM tag.

8045
03:42:35,440 --> 03:42:36,880
Let's remove it and see if we get better.

8046
03:42:40,760 --> 03:42:41,560
You're still right.

8047
03:42:41,640 --> 03:42:42,120
You're still right.

8048
03:42:42,160 --> 03:42:42,660
It's the tag.

8049
03:42:42,800 --> 03:42:43,600
It's the tag curse.

8050
03:42:46,280 --> 03:42:47,780
It'd be funny when we get tagged.

8051
03:42:48,020 --> 03:42:51,920
I'm about to just literally say to fucking that chat, guys are choked.

8052
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:53,120
We jerking each other off or what?

8053
03:42:53,200 --> 03:42:53,740
Do it!

8054
03:42:53,900 --> 03:42:54,120
Do it!

8055
03:42:55,200 --> 03:42:55,760
Do it!

8056
03:42:55,900 --> 03:42:56,320
Do it.

8057
03:42:56,320 --> 03:42:56,420
Do it!

8058
03:43:00,220 --> 03:43:00,580
Uh...

8059
03:43:02,780 --> 03:43:04,540
Okay, I'm taking off the TSM tag.

8060
03:43:04,860 --> 03:43:06,440
Guys, we got fired from TSM.

8061
03:43:06,800 --> 03:43:07,240
We are.

8062
03:43:07,460 --> 03:43:08,820
Oh, we only dropped one rank.

8063
03:43:08,820 --> 03:43:09,300
We're in 15.

8064
03:43:09,800 --> 03:43:11,060
Oh, it's still about how far we all came.

8065
03:43:11,460 --> 03:43:12,140
Seven points.

8066
03:43:12,500 --> 03:43:12,840
Oh.

8067
03:43:13,720 --> 03:43:14,080
Okay.

8068
03:43:14,360 --> 03:43:15,220
Alright, so yeah.

8069
03:43:15,380 --> 03:43:15,840
Yeah, yeah.

8070
03:43:15,960 --> 03:43:16,320
Okay.

8071
03:43:16,800 --> 03:43:17,520
It's not bad at all.

8072
03:43:17,580 --> 03:43:18,080
Seven points?

8073
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:19,420
If you get a ten point game, we're definitely back in it.

8074
03:43:19,620 --> 03:43:19,980
Yeah.

8075
03:43:19,980 --> 03:43:21,520
I got rid of TSM.

8076
03:43:21,800 --> 03:43:22,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8077
03:43:22,460 --> 03:43:23,080
Ten point game.

8078
03:43:23,600 --> 03:43:24,440
Alright, let's go.

8079
03:43:24,480 --> 03:43:25,060
Ten point game, guys.

8080
03:43:25,100 --> 03:43:25,500
We need this one.

8081
03:43:26,540 --> 03:43:27,320
Guys, okay.

8082
03:43:27,740 --> 03:43:28,280
Wait, wait, wait.

8083
03:43:28,280 --> 03:43:29,020
Twelve, nine, seven.

8084
03:43:29,160 --> 03:43:30,800
We need third and three kills, okay?

8085
03:43:31,520 --> 03:43:31,880
Easy.

8086
03:43:32,120 --> 03:43:32,700
Nice, yeah.

8087
03:43:33,260 --> 03:43:34,140
It's so easy, guys.

8088
03:43:34,340 --> 03:43:35,420
We have two POIs.

8089
03:43:35,500 --> 03:43:36,300
We can't fuck this up.

8090
03:43:37,580 --> 03:43:38,300
Yeah, exactly.

8091
03:43:39,200 --> 03:43:39,960
There's no way.

8092
03:43:41,440 --> 03:43:42,120
There's no way.

8093
03:43:43,880 --> 03:43:45,120
I'll just type code in chat.

8094
03:43:45,640 --> 03:43:48,220
Oh, that would be so funny.

8095
03:43:48,220 --> 03:43:50,880
Oh, G-Table, your loadout was crazy, bro.

8096
03:43:51,400 --> 03:43:52,900
P20 charge rifle is nuts.

8097
03:43:53,120 --> 03:43:54,320
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

8098
03:43:54,520 --> 03:43:55,500
I was like, is that P20?

8099
03:43:55,500 --> 03:43:55,980
I couldn't find the read.

8100
03:43:56,400 --> 03:43:56,760
Alright?

8101
03:43:56,900 --> 03:43:58,320
I had hammer points, okay?

8102
03:43:58,320 --> 03:43:59,980
The thing is, I don't think that makes it better.

8103
03:44:00,660 --> 03:44:01,240
No, no.

8104
03:44:01,560 --> 03:44:04,820
There were so many big guns on the ground when I passed, it was crazy.

8105
03:44:05,380 --> 03:44:07,220
Wait, Hammer doesn't make it better?

8106
03:44:08,360 --> 03:44:08,720
No.

8107
03:44:08,840 --> 03:44:10,780
Well, I was also looking for a read.

8108
03:44:11,600 --> 03:44:12,040
That's why.

8109
03:44:13,740 --> 03:44:14,100
Fair.

8110
03:44:14,880 --> 03:44:15,600
Fair, fair.

8111
03:44:15,660 --> 03:44:17,960
How do you not find a read?

8112
03:44:19,800 --> 03:44:20,740
That's so weird.

8113
03:44:20,880 --> 03:44:22,060
That's like one of the...

8114
03:44:23,480 --> 03:44:25,140
Whoever geyser choked...

8115
03:44:26,180 --> 03:44:26,960
choking each other.

8116
03:44:29,780 --> 03:44:31,380
Guys, I'm in the lobby now.

8117
03:44:32,140 --> 03:44:32,560
We're good.

8118
03:44:32,840 --> 03:44:33,280
I'm here.

8119
03:44:33,780 --> 03:44:35,680
You guys know the lobby codes out, guys?

8120
03:44:36,140 --> 03:44:36,860
Oh yeah, we're in here.

8121
03:44:38,000 --> 03:44:38,600
We're in here.

8122
03:44:38,680 --> 03:44:39,500
By the way, we're in.

8123
03:44:41,100 --> 03:44:41,680
Alright, guys.

8124
03:44:41,760 --> 03:44:42,320
10-point game.

8125
03:44:42,420 --> 03:44:42,920
Let's do this.

8126
03:44:43,380 --> 03:44:44,300
Alright, 10-point game.

8127
03:44:44,360 --> 03:44:44,520
Easy.

8128
03:44:44,880 --> 03:44:45,920
Never lost a 10-point game.

8129
03:44:47,060 --> 03:44:47,720
This is it.

8130
03:44:47,740 --> 03:44:48,200
This is it.

8131
03:44:50,620 --> 03:44:51,300
We got this.

8132
03:44:54,440 --> 03:44:55,080
This is it.

8133
03:44:55,120 --> 03:44:56,040
I believe in this.

8134
03:44:56,060 --> 03:44:57,000
I'm in that situation, bro.

8135
03:44:57,020 --> 03:44:57,540
You're go for that.

8136
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:00,220
We can do this.

8137
03:45:00,240 --> 03:45:01,220
We're like 40 barrels down in the hole.

8138
03:45:01,320 --> 03:45:02,240
I feel like...

8139
03:45:02,980 --> 03:45:08,780
If that team just left me alone, I feel like I could have flew and then landed somewhere and just rap jammed all the way to third.

8140
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:09,720
Yes, but Warren, challenge your circuit.

8141
03:45:09,780 --> 03:45:11,700
No team actually thinks for themselves.

8142
03:45:12,620 --> 03:45:12,980
Yeah.

8143
03:45:13,820 --> 03:45:15,640
They rely on feelings.

8144
03:45:16,380 --> 03:45:17,580
Yo, you know what?

8145
03:45:17,660 --> 03:45:20,740
They should make it and then we can play Pathfinder.

8146
03:45:20,860 --> 03:45:22,540
They should make it so Pathfinder can't be scanned.

8147
03:45:23,180 --> 03:45:24,220
Because he's a robot.

8148
03:45:24,540 --> 03:45:25,120
What the fuck?

8149
03:45:25,980 --> 03:45:29,860
Because then we could just play Pathfinder and no one would scan us.

8150
03:45:30,880 --> 03:45:33,260
Yeah, but then the rest of us can get scanned.

8151
03:45:33,520 --> 03:45:34,880
Oh no, when we're ratting.

8152
03:45:35,120 --> 03:45:37,720
Oh, when the rat has to rat.

8153
03:45:39,600 --> 03:45:42,360
Yeah, when the Pathfinder has to rat, basically.

8154
03:45:42,380 --> 03:45:42,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8155
03:45:43,560 --> 03:45:44,680
Oh, I see.

8156
03:45:44,940 --> 03:45:48,520
Great job fighting to that team who tried to fight us leaving Geyser.

8157
03:45:49,360 --> 03:45:49,720
Yeah.

8158
03:45:49,920 --> 03:45:51,040
I think that's us.

8159
03:45:52,100 --> 03:45:52,820
Whoever Geyser...

8160
03:45:54,060 --> 03:45:54,940
Wait, what were you saying?

8161
03:45:55,000 --> 03:45:56,840
They were beating each other off in the Geyser room?

8162
03:45:57,080 --> 03:45:57,800
The Geyser choke?

8163
03:45:58,620 --> 03:45:58,980
Yeah.

8164
03:46:00,060 --> 03:46:01,280
Were we in the Geyser choke?

8165
03:46:01,420 --> 03:46:02,560
We were not in the Geyser choke.

8166
03:46:02,660 --> 03:46:05,820
No, but the team Geyser choke didn't shoot the Blue Bin team at all.

8167
03:46:05,860 --> 03:46:06,840
I don't know what the fuck they were doing.

8168
03:46:07,760 --> 03:46:14,140
Like in that situation, we were like, definitely maybe need to show more presence in the front, but that team on Geyser choke should be shooting that Blue Bin the whole time.

8169
03:46:14,280 --> 03:46:16,080
That was like the freest kills for both of us.

8170
03:46:17,840 --> 03:46:18,680
Alright, 100P.

8171
03:46:20,260 --> 03:46:22,080
I believe in us, guys.

8172
03:46:22,980 --> 03:46:24,180
We can do this.

8173
03:46:24,260 --> 03:46:25,100
There's no way.

8174
03:46:25,460 --> 03:46:29,200
We just need a really, really, really good last game.

8175
03:46:30,700 --> 03:46:32,400
No, just a semi.

8176
03:46:32,800 --> 03:46:36,320
3 and 3 isn't that much of a stretch.

8177
03:46:36,980 --> 03:46:38,940
This is literally our last game tempo.

8178
03:46:39,060 --> 03:46:40,240
We really need a good game.

8179
03:46:40,620 --> 03:46:41,500
Yeah, 3 and 3.

8180
03:46:41,820 --> 03:46:42,960
12, 9, 7, 8.

8181
03:46:42,980 --> 03:46:43,840
That's 10 points.

8182
03:46:48,520 --> 03:46:49,840
Yo, teammate is duo.

8183
03:46:49,920 --> 03:46:50,840
Do we just land on them?

8184
03:46:53,060 --> 03:46:53,540
No.

8185
03:46:54,080 --> 03:46:55,340
Yeah, we get 2 free kills.

8186
03:46:56,100 --> 03:46:58,840
What if another team thirds as well?

8187
03:46:59,060 --> 03:47:00,060
There's no way.

8188
03:47:00,920 --> 03:47:03,640
I bet you this team is a controller team.

8189
03:47:03,780 --> 03:47:05,420
We play 3 shooting people.

8190
03:47:05,580 --> 03:47:07,260
Or 3 ability damage people.

8191
03:47:07,720 --> 03:47:07,860
There's no way.

8192
03:47:07,920 --> 03:47:09,620
We're not griefing our last game.

8193
03:47:10,780 --> 03:47:12,280
Maggie, Fuse, and...

8194
03:47:12,280 --> 03:47:13,220
Oh shoot, Stuck.

8195
03:47:13,440 --> 03:47:14,080
And Valk.

8196
03:47:14,200 --> 03:47:15,060
Maggie, Fuse, and Valk.

8197
03:47:15,060 --> 03:47:16,180
And then we land on the duo.

8198
03:47:16,360 --> 03:47:17,820
He wants us to land on the duo.

8199
03:47:18,100 --> 03:47:20,300
Maggie, Fuse, and Valk.

8200
03:47:20,440 --> 03:47:23,760
And we just ability spam team 8 and land on them.

8201
03:47:23,860 --> 03:47:24,660
Late land on them.

8202
03:47:24,700 --> 03:47:25,800
And then get 2 free points.

8203
03:47:26,320 --> 03:47:27,260
Where do we...

8204
03:47:27,840 --> 03:47:28,280
Where...

8205
03:47:30,020 --> 03:47:31,600
God, my head hurts so hard.

8206
03:47:34,600 --> 03:47:35,380
Oh, fuck.

8207
03:47:36,860 --> 03:47:37,300
Um...

8208
03:47:37,300 --> 03:47:38,060
I mean...

8209
03:47:41,800 --> 03:47:43,000
Let's just go Lava Siphon.

8210
03:47:45,020 --> 03:47:46,500
Let's go Lava Siphon, guys.

8211
03:47:46,660 --> 03:47:47,400
Let's get a rotation.

8212
03:47:47,760 --> 03:47:49,320
We just need a good endgame, bro.

8213
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:52,660
I don't think we can go...

8214
03:47:52,660 --> 03:47:53,080
We broke Wig.

8215
03:47:53,120 --> 03:47:54,360
We got top 3.

8216
03:47:54,460 --> 03:47:54,960
We can qualify.

8217
03:47:55,320 --> 03:47:57,100
Bro, you actually broke Wig.

8218
03:47:57,140 --> 03:47:58,840
He's just like, did you just say that?

8219
03:47:59,680 --> 03:48:00,280
I'm not kidding.

8220
03:48:02,480 --> 03:48:03,460
I actually ignored the whole thing.

8221
03:48:03,540 --> 03:48:06,480
I heard that and I was like, dude, I can't.

8222
03:48:06,640 --> 03:48:07,280
I'm so low on the game.

8223
03:48:07,280 --> 03:48:07,280
I'm so low on the game.

8224
03:48:07,300 --> 03:48:09,820
I'm so locked in to get this top 10 right now that I just can't think about what we just said.

8225
03:48:11,940 --> 03:48:12,580
I can't.

8226
03:48:12,580 --> 03:48:12,900
I can't.

8227
03:48:12,920 --> 03:48:13,480
I'm locked.

8228
03:48:13,520 --> 03:48:13,860
We got this.

8229
03:48:14,060 --> 03:48:14,600
We got this.

8230
03:48:15,600 --> 03:48:16,540
We're doing this.

8231
03:48:16,620 --> 03:48:17,020
I believe.

8232
03:48:21,240 --> 03:48:21,760
Let's do it.

8233
03:48:21,860 --> 03:48:23,260
We are a World's Edge team.

8234
03:48:24,020 --> 03:48:24,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8235
03:48:25,400 --> 03:48:28,480
Guys, don't fucking take my 2 points that I got in the first game.

8236
03:48:29,440 --> 03:48:31,400
Guys, it has to matter.

8237
03:48:31,640 --> 03:48:32,500
It was 2 points.

8238
03:48:33,340 --> 03:48:34,220
We don't do anything.

8239
03:48:34,300 --> 03:48:35,740
Those 2 points you did didn't mean fuck all.

8240
03:48:36,060 --> 03:48:37,220
Yeah, like what the fuck?

8241
03:48:37,240 --> 03:48:38,120
I tried so hard.

8242
03:48:38,480 --> 03:48:39,220
I'm bang, right?

8243
03:48:39,620 --> 03:48:39,860
I'm bleeding.

8244
03:48:40,100 --> 03:48:43,280
I'm actually... I wanna point out how good that would have been for us if we stayed alive.

8245
03:48:43,400 --> 03:48:43,740
That sucks.

8246
03:48:43,940 --> 03:48:44,340
Yeah.

8247
03:48:45,200 --> 03:48:46,240
We got this.

8248
03:48:46,280 --> 03:48:46,880
We got this.

8249
03:48:54,050 --> 03:48:54,450
Alrighty.

8250
03:48:56,650 --> 03:48:57,050
Locked.

8251
03:48:57,190 --> 03:48:57,210
Locked.

8252
03:48:58,550 --> 03:49:00,170
I have to go to the bathroom pretty bad though.

8253
03:49:01,350 --> 03:49:02,130
Alright, let's do it.

8254
03:49:02,130 --> 03:49:04,030
Wait, did you not go to the bathroom just then?

8255
03:49:04,370 --> 03:49:04,890
I did.

8256
03:49:04,890 --> 03:49:04,890
I did.

8257
03:49:04,990 --> 03:49:05,910
Okay, I was gonna say.

8258
03:49:05,910 --> 03:49:06,910
Yo, we got beacon.

8259
03:49:07,410 --> 03:49:08,310
We got beacon.

8260
03:49:08,770 --> 03:49:09,770
Wait, my game crashed.

8261
03:49:09,810 --> 03:49:10,290
My game crashed.

8262
03:49:11,430 --> 03:49:11,830
What?

8263
03:49:11,910 --> 03:49:12,830
My game crashed.

8264
03:49:13,570 --> 03:49:13,930
No!

8265
03:49:14,210 --> 03:49:16,210
Alt F4 your game because you are still in here.

8266
03:49:16,310 --> 03:49:18,110
So Alt F4 your game and then reconnect.

8267
03:49:18,550 --> 03:49:20,670
Your water orn look we know what is going on.

8268
03:49:20,670 --> 03:49:21,030
No way!

8269
03:49:21,110 --> 03:49:21,870
No way!

8270
03:49:21,890 --> 03:49:22,490
No way!

8271
03:49:22,590 --> 03:49:23,710
Can you not F4 reset?

8272
03:49:24,430 --> 03:49:27,010
If you Alt F4 you can get in.

8273
03:49:27,250 --> 03:49:28,650
No, no, my game like full crashed.

8274
03:49:29,190 --> 03:49:31,410
Yeah, just close your entire game and then restart.

8275
03:49:31,610 --> 03:49:33,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just closed the entire game.

8276
03:49:33,770 --> 03:49:34,790
You should really get back in.

8277
03:49:34,970 --> 03:49:36,010
Okay, that was so scary.

8278
03:49:36,150 --> 03:49:36,610
Please, please, please.

8279
03:49:36,610 --> 03:49:37,650
Wait, there is still going on with typing now.

8280
03:49:37,830 --> 03:49:39,670
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

8281
03:49:39,850 --> 03:49:39,870
You think so?

8282
03:49:39,870 --> 03:49:40,590
It looks like it, right?

8283
03:49:40,810 --> 03:49:41,810
Please, please, please, please, please.

8284
03:49:41,810 --> 03:49:42,490
No, they are going left.

8285
03:49:42,490 --> 03:49:43,090
I thought you could reset.

8286
03:49:43,710 --> 03:49:44,470
Please, please, please.

8287
03:49:44,610 --> 03:49:45,590
No, what is her luck?

8288
03:49:46,810 --> 03:49:47,550
We are good, we are good.

8289
03:49:47,710 --> 03:49:47,970
I am in, I am in.

8290
03:49:47,970 --> 03:49:48,690
No one is lining with us.

8291
03:49:48,970 --> 03:49:49,810
I am going to land here in the middle.

8292
03:49:49,850 --> 03:49:50,290
I am going to land here in the middle.

8293
03:49:50,350 --> 03:49:50,770
And punch her in.

8294
03:49:51,130 --> 03:49:53,330
I am in, I am in, I am in, I am in, I am in, I am in.

8295
03:49:54,090 --> 03:49:55,570
I am going to land in middle because of Beacon.

8296
03:49:56,010 --> 03:49:56,830
Just hit the Beacon.

8297
03:49:56,910 --> 03:49:57,710
Let me get this to you.

8298
03:49:58,450 --> 03:49:59,650
Is there a team on us?

8299
03:50:01,610 --> 03:50:02,470
No, no, no, no.

8300
03:50:02,470 --> 03:50:04,890
Okay, I am going to loot the inside of this then.

8301
03:50:04,910 --> 03:50:05,250
Okay, nice.

8302
03:50:05,950 --> 03:50:06,950
Oh my god.

8303
03:50:07,390 --> 03:50:10,230
That would have been a shitty way to go out.

8304
03:50:10,310 --> 03:50:10,950
Oh my God.

8305
03:50:12,170 --> 03:50:12,970
Jesus Christ.

8306
03:50:13,330 --> 03:50:14,410
Alright, so I'm close too.

8307
03:50:14,530 --> 03:50:15,390
We got a good rotation here.

8308
03:50:15,410 --> 03:50:16,110
Probably gonna be staging side.

8309
03:50:18,250 --> 03:50:19,450
Holy fuck me, man.

8310
03:50:19,650 --> 03:50:20,390
That was scary.

8311
03:50:20,670 --> 03:50:21,190
Not gonna lie.

8312
03:50:21,190 --> 03:50:22,570
Pressing me the fuck out.

8313
03:50:23,230 --> 03:50:24,210
That was so scary.

8314
03:50:24,290 --> 03:50:24,690
Thank God.

8315
03:50:25,190 --> 03:50:26,590
I got gold helmet though.

8316
03:50:26,790 --> 03:50:27,170
Let's go.

8317
03:50:27,430 --> 03:50:28,890
Wait, we have two gold helmets?

8318
03:50:29,170 --> 03:50:29,710
It's huge.

8319
03:50:29,910 --> 03:50:31,370
We'll give it to you when we get into town.

8320
03:50:31,470 --> 03:50:31,790
It's great.

8321
03:50:36,450 --> 03:50:38,310
Yeah, I'm gonna look the far left.

8322
03:50:38,450 --> 03:50:39,130
The far left.

8323
03:50:39,390 --> 03:50:40,710
There's something over there.

8324
03:50:40,730 --> 03:50:41,290
Purple stuff.

8325
03:50:41,410 --> 03:50:42,190
I don't know what it is.

8326
03:50:42,190 --> 03:50:42,650
I'll look.

8327
03:50:43,830 --> 03:50:45,630
Guys, I found my re.

8328
03:50:46,890 --> 03:50:47,250
Nice.

8329
03:50:47,250 --> 03:50:48,070
One game too late.

8330
03:50:48,210 --> 03:50:48,710
Watch this.

8331
03:50:50,130 --> 03:50:50,490
Nah.

8332
03:50:51,490 --> 03:50:54,270
There's also a bunch of evac towers over here if you guys wanna have them.

8333
03:50:54,890 --> 03:50:55,570
You ping it?

8334
03:50:56,190 --> 03:50:56,810
Yeah, I got you.

8335
03:50:56,910 --> 03:50:57,270
Nice.

8336
03:50:59,790 --> 03:51:00,350
Got it.

8337
03:51:01,750 --> 03:51:02,110
Damage.

8338
03:51:02,370 --> 03:51:02,510
Damage.

8339
03:51:02,670 --> 03:51:03,650
Do you see a repeater?

8340
03:51:03,730 --> 03:51:04,150
Let me know.

8341
03:51:04,870 --> 03:51:06,350
We have the geocache over here too.

8342
03:51:06,830 --> 03:51:07,430
What do we want?

8343
03:51:07,470 --> 03:51:08,650
Top thermal or...

8344
03:51:10,230 --> 03:51:11,770
Yeah, it's gonna be thermal chokes.

8345
03:51:13,630 --> 03:51:13,970
Thermal chokes.

8346
03:51:13,970 --> 03:51:15,610
Yeah, there's an energy mag here.

8347
03:51:21,010 --> 03:51:22,070
I'm gonna grab this.

8348
03:51:22,190 --> 03:51:22,630
Actually, no.

8349
03:51:22,690 --> 03:51:24,110
I don't need a repeater anymore.

8350
03:51:24,230 --> 03:51:24,890
I have a carbine.

8351
03:51:25,410 --> 03:51:26,930
There's a purple heavy mag here.

8352
03:51:27,890 --> 03:51:29,150
Someone with thermal will be really good.

8353
03:51:29,230 --> 03:51:30,790
I think the two story buildings will be really good for us.

8354
03:51:30,870 --> 03:51:32,010
So we should probably rush immediately if we can.

8355
03:51:32,150 --> 03:51:33,290
Okay, I'm coming over then.

8356
03:51:33,470 --> 03:51:34,510
Yeah, come over me now guys.

8357
03:51:34,550 --> 03:51:34,910
Both of you.

8358
03:51:34,950 --> 03:51:37,190
I wanna get here fast.

8359
03:51:37,350 --> 03:51:39,350
I don't really wanna deal with the bullshitting and try to get a good spot in zone.

8360
03:51:40,570 --> 03:51:40,890
Alright.

8361
03:51:41,630 --> 03:51:42,230
I'm running.

8362
03:51:42,490 --> 03:51:42,930
I'm running.

8363
03:51:43,670 --> 03:51:44,090
Yeah, yeah.

8364
03:51:44,110 --> 03:51:44,490
Come my way.

8365
03:51:45,290 --> 03:51:45,370
I'm running.

8366
03:51:46,150 --> 03:51:47,210
No tempo so far.

8367
03:51:47,230 --> 03:51:47,750
It should be fine now.

8368
03:51:48,290 --> 03:51:49,690
There's a charge rifle here too.

8369
03:51:50,510 --> 03:51:51,210
That's too late.

8370
03:51:53,370 --> 03:51:54,450
I have a sense.

8371
03:51:55,650 --> 03:51:56,370
I don't know.

8372
03:51:56,390 --> 03:51:58,650
I also have a vault key if we need something in the end here.

8373
03:51:58,890 --> 03:51:59,030
I don't know.

8374
03:51:59,030 --> 03:51:59,050
I also have a vault key if we need something in the end here.

8375
03:51:59,050 --> 03:51:59,530
Maybe, maybe.

8376
03:51:59,590 --> 03:52:00,130
Let's just go quick.

8377
03:52:00,450 --> 03:52:01,850
Yeah, we just move first.

8378
03:52:02,950 --> 03:52:05,190
If we get those two stories, we can actually win this game I think.

8379
03:52:05,250 --> 03:52:05,850
I think it's gonna pull that way.

8380
03:52:06,250 --> 03:52:08,170
Could even go island, but regardless, we still can play.

8381
03:52:08,930 --> 03:52:09,770
Come on, get that.

8382
03:52:10,050 --> 03:52:11,810
Evac and then I'm running straight.

8383
03:52:11,910 --> 03:52:13,310
I mean, it's in my pathway anyway.

8384
03:52:13,830 --> 03:52:14,350
Yeah, it's fine.

8385
03:52:14,390 --> 03:52:14,750
No, don't worry.

8386
03:52:14,850 --> 03:52:15,330
You should probably get it.

8387
03:52:15,390 --> 03:52:15,610
You're chilling.

8388
03:52:17,290 --> 03:52:17,890
Alright, I'm good.

8389
03:52:18,630 --> 03:52:18,870
Okay.

8390
03:52:20,150 --> 03:52:21,250
Wait, do you need a heavy mag?

8391
03:52:21,930 --> 03:52:22,870
No, I'm actually good bro.

8392
03:52:22,910 --> 03:52:23,450
I got a purple one.

8393
03:52:23,510 --> 03:52:23,710
I'm chilling.

8394
03:52:23,890 --> 03:52:24,730
I have no backpack.

8395
03:52:25,190 --> 03:52:25,730
This is bad.

8396
03:52:27,050 --> 03:52:27,370
It's fine.

8397
03:52:27,490 --> 03:52:27,910
It should be fine.

8398
03:52:28,750 --> 03:52:30,370
Yeah, I didn't get a chance to do the people scan.

8399
03:52:31,190 --> 03:52:31,550
Don't forget.

8400
03:52:31,650 --> 03:52:32,050
No, it's all good.

8401
03:52:32,090 --> 03:52:33,690
We're gonna go towards tree and then ult the end.

8402
03:52:35,330 --> 03:52:36,250
Actually, can I evac?

8403
03:52:36,530 --> 03:52:38,070
If I... Okay, we're gonna try something here.

8404
03:52:38,150 --> 03:52:38,630
We're gonna try something.

8405
03:52:38,830 --> 03:52:39,430
We're gonna come to me.

8406
03:52:39,950 --> 03:52:40,190
Yeah.

8407
03:52:41,170 --> 03:52:41,590
Not here.

8408
03:52:41,650 --> 03:52:41,890
Not here.

8409
03:52:41,890 --> 03:52:42,170
Not here.

8410
03:52:42,170 --> 03:52:42,370
Not here.

8411
03:52:42,370 --> 03:52:43,770
Can I grab that canister?

8412
03:52:44,270 --> 03:52:45,170
Yeah, go get that cash.

8413
03:52:45,270 --> 03:52:45,790
Go get the cash.

8414
03:52:46,110 --> 03:52:47,490
Yeah, we gotta wait for Doki anyway.

8415
03:52:47,790 --> 03:52:48,270
Yeah, you're chilling.

8416
03:52:48,510 --> 03:52:49,110
You should be fine.

8417
03:52:49,470 --> 03:52:50,050
Yep, I'm good.

8418
03:52:50,090 --> 03:52:50,150
I'm here.

8419
03:52:50,150 --> 03:52:54,730
So, when we slam inside one of these buildings, guys, it's a really good chance we're gonna be there.

8420
03:52:54,830 --> 03:52:56,290
So, just like stay together.

8421
03:52:56,450 --> 03:52:58,370
We're gonna literally just try to slam inside one of the buildings.

8422
03:52:58,490 --> 03:52:58,750
I'm here.

8423
03:52:58,750 --> 03:52:59,170
I'm here.

8424
03:52:59,830 --> 03:53:00,510
Okay, you're good.

8425
03:53:00,570 --> 03:53:00,670
You're good.

8426
03:53:00,710 --> 03:53:00,910
Don't worry.

8427
03:53:01,030 --> 03:53:01,370
I'm chilling.

8428
03:53:02,390 --> 03:53:03,010
Alright, come over to me.

8429
03:53:04,270 --> 03:53:04,570
Ready?

8430
03:53:04,850 --> 03:53:06,590
Can I go up here and hit this?

8431
03:53:07,350 --> 03:53:07,810
I can.

8432
03:53:09,550 --> 03:53:10,150
How do I touch this?

8433
03:53:10,630 --> 03:53:10,930
What?

8434
03:53:11,550 --> 03:53:12,350
How do I touch this?

8435
03:53:13,170 --> 03:53:13,490
You're good.

8436
03:53:13,550 --> 03:53:13,690
You're good.

8437
03:53:13,730 --> 03:53:13,970
You got this.

8438
03:53:14,790 --> 03:53:15,030
Alright.

8439
03:53:16,370 --> 03:53:16,850
Up here.

8440
03:53:17,010 --> 03:53:17,250
Okay?

8441
03:53:17,770 --> 03:53:18,510
It's hard ping.

8442
03:53:20,470 --> 03:53:20,870
I'll get it.

8443
03:53:20,910 --> 03:53:21,050
I'll ping.

8444
03:53:22,390 --> 03:53:23,390
We're gonna see which one's free though.

8445
03:53:23,890 --> 03:53:24,970
One of those buildings, yeah.

8446
03:53:27,030 --> 03:53:28,930
We're gonna try to slam the second floor of this left one, okay?

8447
03:53:29,350 --> 03:53:29,730
This one?

8448
03:53:30,450 --> 03:53:30,850
This one.

8449
03:53:30,870 --> 03:53:31,090
Left one.

8450
03:53:31,190 --> 03:53:31,310
Right here.

8451
03:53:31,370 --> 03:53:31,570
Okay.

8452
03:53:33,030 --> 03:53:33,590
Then right here.

8453
03:53:33,670 --> 03:53:36,290
Then we're gonna scan across and we're gonna try to get to the next one if there's no one in that one, okay?

8454
03:53:36,950 --> 03:53:37,290
One sec.

8455
03:53:38,110 --> 03:53:38,370
On us!

8456
03:53:38,470 --> 03:53:38,550
On us!

8457
03:53:38,690 --> 03:53:38,690
On us!

8458
03:53:39,590 --> 03:53:39,830
Here.

8459
03:53:40,610 --> 03:53:40,730
Here.

8460
03:53:42,370 --> 03:53:42,770
Come upstairs.

8461
03:53:42,870 --> 03:53:43,190
Come upstairs.

8462
03:53:44,770 --> 03:53:46,310
That trap downstairs is not mine.

8463
03:53:46,570 --> 03:53:46,770
You're good.

8464
03:53:46,870 --> 03:53:47,030
You're good.

8465
03:53:47,310 --> 03:53:47,550
Okay.

8466
03:53:49,010 --> 03:53:49,650
Can you scan across?

8467
03:53:50,770 --> 03:53:51,650
No more scans.

8468
03:53:51,710 --> 03:53:51,970
No more scans.

8469
03:53:52,570 --> 03:53:52,810
Okay.

8470
03:53:52,830 --> 03:53:53,010
Okay.

8471
03:53:53,630 --> 03:53:54,350
We're gonna wait for the scan.

8472
03:53:54,450 --> 03:53:54,750
Are they okay?

8473
03:53:54,970 --> 03:53:55,230
Three seconds.

8474
03:53:55,270 --> 03:53:55,570
Three seconds.

8475
03:53:55,830 --> 03:53:56,070
Scanning.

8476
03:53:56,130 --> 03:53:56,370
Scanning.

8477
03:53:57,270 --> 03:53:57,510
Yep.

8478
03:53:57,550 --> 03:53:58,570
If there's no one in the next building, we should go.

8479
03:53:59,350 --> 03:54:00,090
Take this building then.

8480
03:54:00,190 --> 03:54:00,470
Come here.

8481
03:54:00,590 --> 03:54:01,470
What happened to them?

8482
03:54:02,090 --> 03:54:02,450
I don't know.

8483
03:54:02,470 --> 03:54:02,830
They backed up.

8484
03:54:02,890 --> 03:54:03,290
There was one guy.

8485
03:54:03,550 --> 03:54:04,090
He shot himself.

8486
03:54:04,770 --> 03:54:05,090
It's fine.

8487
03:54:05,970 --> 03:54:06,210
Alright.

8488
03:54:06,250 --> 03:54:06,730
Let's take this one.

8489
03:54:06,770 --> 03:54:06,970
We're good.

8490
03:54:07,010 --> 03:54:08,170
We're gonna hold this one and we're chilling.

8491
03:54:08,170 --> 03:54:09,230
There's a Loba near us.

8492
03:54:09,670 --> 03:54:10,090
That's fine.

8493
03:54:10,170 --> 03:54:10,350
Great.

8494
03:54:10,470 --> 03:54:10,630
Okay.

8495
03:54:10,730 --> 03:54:11,010
Nice.

8496
03:54:12,010 --> 03:54:12,430
We're good.

8497
03:54:12,490 --> 03:54:13,190
Set up our floors.

8498
03:54:13,490 --> 03:54:14,430
Lock doors down below.

8499
03:54:15,050 --> 03:54:15,630
We're good to go.

8500
03:54:15,710 --> 03:54:16,030
Nice job.

8501
03:54:16,110 --> 03:54:16,910
We have no backpack you said?

8502
03:54:17,090 --> 03:54:17,370
No.

8503
03:54:18,230 --> 03:54:18,630
Oh no.

8504
03:54:18,750 --> 03:54:19,170
I have a lot.

8505
03:54:19,230 --> 03:54:20,270
I have eight cells, one bat.

8506
03:54:20,310 --> 03:54:20,510
Okay.

8507
03:54:20,510 --> 03:54:20,830
So not great.

8508
03:54:21,150 --> 03:54:23,330
Like my ammo situation is not good.

8509
03:54:23,650 --> 03:54:25,750
I'm gonna throw... I mean...

8510
03:54:25,750 --> 03:54:27,290
I feel like I need more ammo then.

8511
03:54:28,190 --> 03:54:29,650
Does anyone want my Phoenix kit?

8512
03:54:29,750 --> 03:54:30,090
Oh nevermind.

8513
03:54:30,130 --> 03:54:30,470
I'm coming back out.

8514
03:54:30,530 --> 03:54:30,610
Wait.

8515
03:54:30,670 --> 03:54:30,690
Wait.

8516
03:54:30,730 --> 03:54:30,830
Wait.

8517
03:54:31,630 --> 03:54:32,150
You're gone.

8518
03:54:32,250 --> 03:54:32,710
We're still here.

8519
03:54:32,730 --> 03:54:32,750
Whoa.

8520
03:54:32,770 --> 03:54:32,890
Whoa.

8521
03:54:32,970 --> 03:54:33,070
Whoa.

8522
03:54:33,410 --> 03:54:33,690
Okay.

8523
03:54:33,790 --> 03:54:34,250
There's two up here.

8524
03:54:35,430 --> 03:54:36,430
Trying to get the loot.

8525
03:54:36,490 --> 03:54:38,950
Oh I just realized I have no fucking sight on my...

8526
03:54:39,930 --> 03:54:40,510
sniper gun.

8527
03:54:41,090 --> 03:54:41,730
There's a...

8528
03:54:41,730 --> 03:54:43,990
I'll give you my 2x because I don't think I can shoot really.

8529
03:54:44,390 --> 03:54:44,710
Here.

8530
03:54:45,390 --> 03:54:45,750
That's fair.

8531
03:54:45,770 --> 03:54:48,270
Because I literally don't have the ammo to shoot.

8532
03:54:48,370 --> 03:54:49,010
To poke at all.

8533
03:54:49,230 --> 03:54:49,550
Here.

8534
03:54:49,690 --> 03:54:50,930
Take it before it gets taken.

8535
03:54:51,710 --> 03:54:52,330
What do you need?

8536
03:54:52,350 --> 03:54:52,970
I'll give you my ammo.

8537
03:54:53,310 --> 03:54:56,010
Well I have light and energy and 120 each.

8538
03:54:56,190 --> 03:54:57,090
There's a lot of energy.

8539
03:54:57,250 --> 03:54:58,470
There's some more energy down here too.

8540
03:54:58,470 --> 03:54:58,490
Yeah.

8541
03:54:58,490 --> 03:54:59,490
I don't have the backpack space.

8542
03:54:59,750 --> 03:55:00,750
I only have two stacks of each.

8543
03:55:00,790 --> 03:55:01,250
Oh here.

8544
03:55:01,310 --> 03:55:02,110
I can get it for you.

8545
03:55:02,130 --> 03:55:02,630
I want to get a few here.

8546
03:55:02,790 --> 03:55:03,990
It's like... Yeah.

8547
03:55:04,250 --> 03:55:06,190
You can grab the energy and light here.

8548
03:55:06,690 --> 03:55:07,350
Yeah I got you.

8549
03:55:07,450 --> 03:55:08,410
I'll get the light and energy first.

8550
03:55:08,470 --> 03:55:09,430
I'll get the light and energy first.

8551
03:55:10,010 --> 03:55:12,270
I literally don't have the ammo for poking.

8552
03:55:12,870 --> 03:55:13,230
Here.

8553
03:55:14,210 --> 03:55:15,350
We're gonna keep this door closed guys.

8554
03:55:15,470 --> 03:55:16,090
Just keep this door closed.

8555
03:55:16,410 --> 03:55:17,670
We're not gonna take too much damage if we don't.

8556
03:55:17,910 --> 03:55:19,410
I have two bad stick cells.

8557
03:55:19,730 --> 03:55:23,350
I have one phoenix kit, one bat, and seven cells.

8558
03:55:24,110 --> 03:55:26,910
I literally cannot poke because of the lack of...

8559
03:55:27,670 --> 03:55:28,030
stuff.

8560
03:55:29,650 --> 03:55:30,410
Here's your ammo though.

8561
03:55:30,450 --> 03:55:30,950
Just in case.

8562
03:55:32,650 --> 03:55:33,010
Alright.

8563
03:55:33,010 --> 03:55:33,790
We're a little poor.

8564
03:55:34,250 --> 03:55:34,650
Alright.

8565
03:55:34,670 --> 03:55:36,230
Well we're a little poor now but I'm not gonna lie.

8566
03:55:36,310 --> 03:55:36,750
Our spot's good.

8567
03:55:38,170 --> 03:55:38,970
I just...

8568
03:55:41,010 --> 03:55:43,470
Can't you like climb up on this thing or something?

8569
03:55:43,850 --> 03:55:44,090
No.

8570
03:55:44,410 --> 03:55:45,890
I think they patched it in.

8571
03:55:46,390 --> 03:55:47,930
Yeah they used to be able to.

8572
03:55:48,190 --> 03:55:48,850
Because people would...

8573
03:55:50,010 --> 03:55:54,470
rat here and then like wait until somebody comes in and then shoot them.

8574
03:55:54,890 --> 03:55:56,070
Oh tempo here as well.

8575
03:55:56,170 --> 03:55:56,390
Come here.

8576
03:55:56,430 --> 03:55:56,690
Come upstairs.

8577
03:55:56,950 --> 03:55:57,430
Take this.

8578
03:55:58,890 --> 03:55:59,570
I have more ammo.

8579
03:55:59,770 --> 03:56:01,430
I have my... Oh yeah barrels.

8580
03:56:01,570 --> 03:56:01,770
Yeah.

8581
03:56:01,770 --> 03:56:02,550
Yeah you're good.

8582
03:56:02,590 --> 03:56:02,890
Just in case.

8583
03:56:04,070 --> 03:56:06,710
I definitely don't need my ulti or my fucking Q.

8584
03:56:06,750 --> 03:56:07,610
Yeah you don't need those.

8585
03:56:07,830 --> 03:56:09,030
Yeah there's no... You can't climb that.

8586
03:56:10,370 --> 03:56:11,450
I'm gonna stay in the bathroom.

8587
03:56:11,750 --> 03:56:14,270
I don't think I can contribute to the team unless somebody pushes us.

8588
03:56:14,390 --> 03:56:15,270
I can't really do anything either.

8589
03:56:15,570 --> 03:56:17,030
I'm just kidding.

8590
03:56:17,250 --> 03:56:19,390
I hope the zone comes to your game.

8591
03:56:19,450 --> 03:56:19,870
That's what this is.

8592
03:56:20,290 --> 03:56:21,390
Well we have evacs right?

8593
03:56:21,510 --> 03:56:22,930
Yeah we have two evacs and knuckles.

8594
03:56:23,710 --> 03:56:24,630
Evac-ing from here.

8595
03:56:24,950 --> 03:56:27,050
I feel like we're shot down.

8596
03:56:28,130 --> 03:56:29,070
Good job though.

8597
03:56:29,190 --> 03:56:29,450
Like...

8598
03:56:29,450 --> 03:56:31,750
Like honestly we just got grief last game.

8599
03:56:31,770 --> 03:56:33,250
We're actually calling zones like pretty good.

8600
03:56:33,330 --> 03:56:33,890
We're not doing anything wrong.

8601
03:56:33,990 --> 03:56:34,270
Yeah yeah.

8602
03:56:34,310 --> 03:56:36,550
It's just other people ruining our game.

8603
03:56:37,450 --> 03:56:39,370
It seems like that's a very common trend for us.

8604
03:56:41,350 --> 03:56:42,790
We never do anything wrong.

8605
03:56:42,970 --> 03:56:44,190
We just need this to pull.

8606
03:56:44,270 --> 03:56:46,910
We just need this to pull literally right here.

8607
03:56:47,770 --> 03:56:49,190
And then we can get top three.

8608
03:56:49,330 --> 03:56:50,270
And we can get kill somewhere.

8609
03:56:50,510 --> 03:56:50,570
Yeah.

8610
03:56:50,770 --> 03:56:52,590
I have three nades though.

8611
03:56:53,750 --> 03:56:54,670
That's all we need bro.

8612
03:56:54,750 --> 03:56:55,590
We literally just need an end game.

8613
03:56:55,690 --> 03:56:56,790
We need nades and ghasts.

8614
03:56:57,050 --> 03:56:59,410
I have no nades but...

8615
03:56:59,870 --> 03:57:01,090
With the 10 minute delay.

8616
03:57:01,770 --> 03:57:02,190
Now everybody knows I'm gay.

8617
03:57:02,670 --> 03:57:04,030
Now everybody knows.

8618
03:57:06,770 --> 03:57:08,790
So my chat said that.

8619
03:57:09,850 --> 03:57:10,570
So my chat said that.

8620
03:57:10,690 --> 03:57:12,070
Didn't chat not have delay?

8621
03:57:12,430 --> 03:57:13,230
Go ahead.

8622
03:57:14,510 --> 03:57:16,190
I don't think he understood the assignment.

8623
03:57:16,530 --> 03:57:17,190
I don't think he understood the assignment.

8624
03:57:17,190 --> 03:57:17,390
I'm confused.

8625
03:57:17,610 --> 03:57:19,650
I don't think he realized what delay means.

8626
03:57:22,510 --> 03:57:23,890
Nothing wrong with it anyway.

8627
03:57:24,010 --> 03:57:24,370
Fuck it.

8628
03:57:24,710 --> 03:57:25,470
Do your thing.

8629
03:57:26,430 --> 03:57:28,230
Good job coming out in my chat.

8630
03:57:30,710 --> 03:57:32,610
Team playing fence over there.

8631
03:57:32,690 --> 03:57:33,010
Team playing fence over there.

8632
03:57:33,230 --> 03:57:34,630
I'm just using the bathroom.

8633
03:57:36,170 --> 03:57:37,730
Can you take one of these barrels...

8634
03:57:37,730 --> 03:57:37,850
Can you take one of these barrels...

8635
03:57:37,850 --> 03:57:39,810
two of these barrels out and put them in the doors in the other building?

8636
03:57:40,070 --> 03:57:40,730
Two of these barrels out and put them in the doors in the other building?

8637
03:57:41,550 --> 03:57:42,330
Block the doors.

8638
03:57:43,990 --> 03:57:44,310
Wait.

8639
03:57:44,370 --> 03:57:45,590
Let's see where this team goes first.

8640
03:57:46,010 --> 03:57:46,290
Wait.

8641
03:57:46,290 --> 03:57:46,350
Wait.

8642
03:57:46,350 --> 03:57:46,650
Wait.

8643
03:57:47,850 --> 03:57:48,830
They're going to land on it I think.

8644
03:57:48,890 --> 03:57:49,170
They are.

8645
03:57:49,550 --> 03:57:50,090
They are?

8646
03:57:51,350 --> 03:57:51,910
No they're not.

8647
03:57:52,050 --> 03:57:52,450
They're not.

8648
03:57:52,590 --> 03:57:53,250
I don't think so.

8649
03:57:53,490 --> 03:57:54,430
I think you can do it buddy.

8650
03:57:55,090 --> 03:57:55,890
Block their doors.

8651
03:57:56,010 --> 03:57:56,290
Alright.

8652
03:57:56,370 --> 03:57:56,990
100 ammo.

8653
03:57:57,190 --> 03:57:57,510
Let's go.

8654
03:57:58,030 --> 03:57:59,290
Block it from the inside?

8655
03:57:59,410 --> 03:57:59,550
Inside.

8656
03:57:59,770 --> 03:57:59,910
Yeah.

8657
03:58:00,010 --> 03:58:01,390
And then come out the top side.

8658
03:58:01,470 --> 03:58:03,150
So when they land inside they can get stuck outside.

8659
03:58:03,330 --> 03:58:03,810
We can kill them.

8660
03:58:03,970 --> 03:58:04,550
Good idea.

8661
03:58:05,050 --> 03:58:05,450
Yay.

8662
03:58:06,330 --> 03:58:07,070
Good idea.

8663
03:58:07,810 --> 03:58:09,150
Seven more squads please die.

8664
03:58:10,250 --> 03:58:11,750
I got more light ammo for you.

8665
03:58:12,090 --> 03:58:13,030
A lot more squads.

8666
03:58:13,490 --> 03:58:14,090
Give me.

8667
03:58:16,350 --> 03:58:20,010
I can only eat like 30 of that though.

8668
03:58:20,850 --> 03:58:21,330
I can only eat like 30 of that though.

8669
03:58:21,410 --> 03:58:22,390
Or not even 30.

8670
03:58:23,050 --> 03:58:24,050
I'm stressed out dude.

8671
03:58:24,090 --> 03:58:24,670
I'm stressed out.

8672
03:58:25,130 --> 03:58:25,510
It's okay.

8673
03:58:26,410 --> 03:58:28,750
As long as we stay in this house they're not going to do anything.

8674
03:58:28,910 --> 03:58:30,050
We have like caustic olives.

8675
03:58:30,490 --> 03:58:32,290
We live on the second floor.

8676
03:58:32,610 --> 03:58:33,330
I live in this.

8677
03:58:33,410 --> 03:58:34,330
They're not going to see me.

8678
03:58:34,530 --> 03:58:35,630
If I live in this bathroom.

8679
03:58:36,350 --> 03:58:36,670
Wait.

8680
03:58:36,750 --> 03:58:38,550
Do you guys have any nades?

8681
03:58:38,730 --> 03:58:39,550
I know Wig has none.

8682
03:58:40,150 --> 03:58:40,470
Zero.

8683
03:58:41,650 --> 03:58:42,210
Okay wait.

8684
03:58:42,250 --> 03:58:44,910
You guys each take a thermite so we can just throw nades at everyone.

8685
03:58:45,250 --> 03:58:45,610
I'll stay up here.

8686
03:58:45,730 --> 03:58:46,910
They'll never expect it.

8687
03:58:47,370 --> 03:58:47,830
Oh my.

8688
03:58:47,910 --> 03:58:48,070
Wait.

8689
03:58:48,110 --> 03:58:48,630
What the fuck?

8690
03:58:49,070 --> 03:58:49,490
Oh yeah.

8691
03:58:49,510 --> 03:58:50,490
So we can get up there.

8692
03:58:50,750 --> 03:58:51,730
There's two spots right here.

8693
03:58:51,770 --> 03:58:52,370
There's another one right here.

8694
03:58:53,010 --> 03:58:53,410
Hi.

8695
03:58:54,310 --> 03:58:55,410
Well I mean.

8696
03:58:56,170 --> 03:58:57,550
Wig's gigantic head is.

8697
03:58:57,850 --> 03:59:02,870
I feel like if I go here they will never look up.

8698
03:59:02,930 --> 03:59:03,810
They always look at the stairs.

8699
03:59:03,990 --> 03:59:05,590
And I can easily grab a kill there.

8700
03:59:06,170 --> 03:59:06,690
Yeah yeah yeah.

8701
03:59:06,770 --> 03:59:07,070
You do that.

8702
03:59:07,170 --> 03:59:08,870
Yeah I'll be here.

8703
03:59:09,010 --> 03:59:10,310
I'll be here to contribute to my team.

8704
03:59:11,030 --> 03:59:12,570
That's a free nade bro.

8705
03:59:12,930 --> 03:59:13,750
Should I scan?

8706
03:59:14,630 --> 03:59:15,010
I should scan.

8707
03:59:16,090 --> 03:59:17,950
Nobody on the house beside us.

8708
03:59:18,250 --> 03:59:19,050
Yeah we should be good.

8709
03:59:19,130 --> 03:59:19,910
We have the doors blocked off.

8710
03:59:20,170 --> 03:59:21,850
I'm just going to be praying the sound comes to us.

8711
03:59:22,650 --> 03:59:23,430
We're so fucked.

8712
03:59:25,350 --> 03:59:28,010
It might pull like back here.

8713
03:59:28,130 --> 03:59:28,570
It could.

8714
03:59:28,710 --> 03:59:31,650
The hell Mary in five seconds.

8715
03:59:32,210 --> 03:59:34,070
If it pulls down there I really don't know what to say guys.

8716
03:59:34,910 --> 03:59:35,790
We had a good run.

8717
03:59:35,890 --> 03:59:37,730
We were just never meant to get past round two.

8718
03:59:37,850 --> 03:59:38,750
Maybe next year.

8719
03:59:40,010 --> 03:59:41,310
Do you know how to move to DC?

8720
03:59:41,890 --> 03:59:42,250
Oh.

8721
03:59:43,150 --> 03:59:43,990
It's fine we stay here.

8722
03:59:44,130 --> 03:59:44,810
It's going to end show.

8723
03:59:44,910 --> 03:59:45,730
Oh wait.

8724
03:59:45,830 --> 03:59:46,170
No.

8725
03:59:46,530 --> 03:59:46,890
No.

8726
03:59:47,170 --> 03:59:48,170
No no no.

8727
03:59:48,410 --> 03:59:49,710
It's pulling back to us.

8728
03:59:49,710 --> 03:59:50,690
It's pulling back to us.

8729
03:59:52,030 --> 03:59:54,510
It's one of those surprise motherfuckers zones.

8730
03:59:54,690 --> 03:59:55,630
Alright how much do you want bet?

8731
03:59:56,410 --> 03:59:57,790
I'll bet a lot of money it does not.

8732
04:00:00,190 --> 04:00:02,950
I'll bet zero dollars because it is baby.

8733
04:00:03,110 --> 04:00:03,410
Let's go.

8734
04:00:03,690 --> 04:00:04,370
Oh shit.

8735
04:00:05,610 --> 04:00:05,710
Oh shit.

8736
04:00:08,390 --> 04:00:09,290
What is this guy doing?

8737
04:00:09,350 --> 04:00:10,090
He's up here just chilling huh?

8738
04:00:10,470 --> 04:00:13,010
Wig I swear please don't get shot by like three different people.

8739
04:00:13,290 --> 04:00:15,770
Someone might try to find this building right now.

8740
04:00:16,070 --> 04:00:17,330
I got shot by one.

8741
04:00:17,670 --> 04:00:19,690
Yeah like I called that and you in the middle of the building.

8742
04:00:19,690 --> 04:00:21,110
Someone had an instant tragedy.

8743
04:00:21,650 --> 04:00:22,490
In this building.

8744
04:00:22,830 --> 04:00:23,410
Where am I?

8745
04:00:23,450 --> 04:00:23,790
Next floor is okay.

8746
04:00:23,910 --> 04:00:26,530
They can't go first floor because of my traps.

8747
04:00:26,710 --> 04:00:27,670
It's fine they are going to be fucked.

8748
04:00:30,030 --> 04:00:31,390
My traps is hurting them.

8749
04:00:31,750 --> 04:00:32,090
That's fine.

8750
04:00:32,770 --> 04:00:33,570
That's fine.

8751
04:00:33,910 --> 04:00:34,730
Just keep this house safe.

8752
04:00:34,950 --> 04:00:36,270
Now block our doors.

8753
04:00:36,310 --> 04:00:36,550
Yeah.

8754
04:00:38,130 --> 04:00:39,110
I'm going to scan.

8755
04:00:39,910 --> 04:00:42,250
I'm going to scan the house behind us.

8756
04:00:42,410 --> 04:00:43,230
I'm going to live here now.

8757
04:00:44,550 --> 04:00:46,930
Yo the fact that these guys are all coming up.

8758
04:00:46,970 --> 04:00:48,450
Makes it seem like.

8759
04:00:49,230 --> 04:00:50,310
No there is no choice.

8760
04:00:51,190 --> 04:00:51,870
They just have no choice.

8761
04:00:52,010 --> 04:00:52,470
They have to.

8762
04:00:53,110 --> 04:00:55,670
They have no choice.

8763
04:00:55,810 --> 04:00:57,430
There is no way they would know either.

8764
04:00:57,790 --> 04:00:58,910
There is no way this challenge is over.

8765
04:00:58,990 --> 04:01:00,450
They scanned this beacon over here.

8766
04:01:01,110 --> 04:01:01,470
Oh.

8767
04:01:03,750 --> 04:01:05,510
They are over here on the fence line right now.

8768
04:01:05,830 --> 04:01:07,750
They know I'm up here.

8769
04:01:08,310 --> 04:01:09,370
They know I'm up here.

8770
04:01:09,370 --> 04:01:11,670
If these two teams fight we 100% just kill these guys.

8771
04:01:11,910 --> 04:01:12,530
Oh my god look at this.

8772
04:01:13,150 --> 04:01:14,870
They are calling this thing hardcore.

8773
04:01:14,870 --> 04:01:17,330
Should we have a barrel on the door or no?

8774
04:01:18,290 --> 04:01:19,470
Yeah we should for sure.

8775
04:01:19,590 --> 04:01:20,270
On the outside maybe.

8776
04:01:20,510 --> 04:01:22,110
They are probably going to break it.

8777
04:01:22,270 --> 04:01:23,390
Yeah they are going to break it.

8778
04:01:24,630 --> 04:01:27,350
I'll throw one there anyway since I have some cooldowns.

8779
04:01:27,530 --> 04:01:28,690
They are going to forget I'm up on this.

8780
04:01:28,790 --> 04:01:29,750
They are going to forget I'm up here.

8781
04:01:29,910 --> 04:01:30,470
I bet you.

8782
04:01:30,610 --> 04:01:33,410
There is no way they will remember.

8783
04:01:35,130 --> 04:01:35,970
You are so right.

8784
04:01:36,110 --> 04:01:36,450
You are so smart.

8785
04:01:37,890 --> 04:01:38,610
There is no way.

8786
04:01:39,590 --> 04:01:40,590
There is no way right guys?

8787
04:01:40,770 --> 04:01:41,310
Yeah right guys.

8788
04:01:41,410 --> 04:01:43,790
There is no way we get a three man shot from here.

8789
04:01:47,170 --> 04:01:49,070
Team full running on the left over here.

8790
04:01:49,250 --> 04:01:49,610
Team full running on the left over here.

8791
04:01:49,610 --> 04:01:50,730
I don't know if you guys can see out the window.

8792
04:01:51,010 --> 04:01:51,410
I can.

8793
04:01:51,530 --> 04:01:51,630
I can.

8794
04:01:51,770 --> 04:01:52,570
I'm scanning.

8795
04:01:55,450 --> 04:01:56,770
Do you want me to help shoot?

8796
04:01:57,430 --> 04:01:57,930
Yeah sure.

8797
04:01:58,410 --> 04:01:59,130
I'm coming down.

8798
04:02:00,990 --> 04:02:01,430
Cracked one.

8799
04:02:01,530 --> 04:02:01,970
They died to kills.

8800
04:02:02,790 --> 04:02:03,510
Got one.

8801
04:02:04,670 --> 04:02:05,030
Nice.

8802
04:02:06,390 --> 04:02:07,630
I think they are full dead.

8803
04:02:07,870 --> 04:02:10,150
We got 2kp.

8804
04:02:10,270 --> 04:02:10,550
Nice job.

8805
04:02:11,190 --> 04:02:12,050
Pull back on us.

8806
04:02:12,330 --> 04:02:14,170
We hold our top floor.

8807
04:02:14,870 --> 04:02:15,630
We hold our top floor no matter what though.

8808
04:02:15,870 --> 04:02:17,550
Call the bottom floor if we need to or anything.

8809
04:02:17,750 --> 04:02:18,430
But you are good right now.

8810
04:02:18,550 --> 04:02:19,130
Just don't die for it.

8811
04:02:19,390 --> 04:02:20,150
I'm trying to.

8812
04:02:20,290 --> 04:02:21,430
I can't do the climb anymore.

8813
04:02:21,870 --> 04:02:23,070
I'm so close to purple armor.

8814
04:02:23,150 --> 04:02:23,890
I really want to try to get this.

8815
04:02:24,630 --> 04:02:25,510
I'm going to try to do the climb.

8816
04:02:25,750 --> 04:02:27,110
No I can't do the climb anymore.

8817
04:02:27,270 --> 04:02:28,950
It was so cool when I was able to do it.

8818
04:02:29,030 --> 04:02:30,570
What are you shooting me for you fucking idiot.

8819
04:02:31,190 --> 04:02:32,070
You guys are so bad.

8820
04:02:32,290 --> 04:02:32,670
I got it.

8821
04:02:34,910 --> 04:02:35,230
Okay.

8822
04:02:35,230 --> 04:02:35,550
Stand.

8823
04:02:36,810 --> 04:02:37,930
How many cells and bats do you have?

8824
04:02:38,170 --> 04:02:40,650
I have one bat and 6 cells.

8825
04:02:40,910 --> 04:02:40,930
Three cells.

8826
04:02:40,930 --> 04:02:41,210
Two bats.

8827
04:02:41,210 --> 04:02:41,690
Okay.

8828
04:02:41,770 --> 04:02:41,990
Okay.

8829
04:02:43,090 --> 04:02:44,010
They are smoking us.

8830
04:02:44,050 --> 04:02:44,710
Just watch our first floor.

8831
04:02:45,110 --> 04:02:46,110
I'm looking first.

8832
04:02:46,230 --> 04:02:46,690
We are good.

8833
04:02:46,790 --> 04:02:47,010
We are good.

8834
04:02:48,450 --> 04:02:51,070
They will never remember I'm up here.

8835
04:02:51,810 --> 04:02:52,170
Never.

8836
04:02:52,450 --> 04:02:53,030
We will never.

8837
04:02:53,150 --> 04:02:56,730
There is no way they will remember.

8838
04:02:57,030 --> 04:02:57,370
Okay.

8839
04:02:57,410 --> 04:02:57,930
I got purple armor.

8840
04:02:58,870 --> 04:02:59,950
I'm going to pop a phoenix for this.

8841
04:03:00,710 --> 04:03:03,490
I have two bats and three cells.

8842
04:03:03,890 --> 04:03:04,230
Okay.

8843
04:03:04,230 --> 04:03:04,410
Nice.

8844
04:03:04,910 --> 04:03:05,270
Alright.

8845
04:03:05,310 --> 04:03:05,650
Nice.

8846
04:03:07,410 --> 04:03:08,370
I'm going to be honest.

8847
04:03:08,470 --> 04:03:09,270
I saw Doki up top.

8848
04:03:09,270 --> 04:03:10,230
I thought it was Tempo on the roof.

8849
04:03:10,250 --> 04:03:10,830
I was about to scream.

8850
04:03:12,130 --> 04:03:14,570
How the fuck would he get to the roof?

8851
04:03:14,670 --> 04:03:15,630
There is no way he would have lived.

8852
04:03:16,250 --> 04:03:17,310
I was like Tempo.

8853
04:03:18,390 --> 04:03:19,170
What the fuck?

8854
04:03:20,350 --> 04:03:21,630
That's the team on the roof though.

8855
04:03:24,830 --> 04:03:25,250
It's okay.

8856
04:03:25,790 --> 04:03:27,570
They will never remember me.

8857
04:03:28,130 --> 04:03:29,770
Is there a bolt up here that I can take?

8858
04:03:29,870 --> 04:03:30,650
Dude's mom is going to fight.

8859
04:03:31,470 --> 04:03:32,290
Dude's mom is going to fight.

8860
04:03:33,990 --> 04:03:34,710
We will see what happens.

8861
04:03:34,830 --> 04:03:35,870
They are coming on the outside of us right now.

8862
04:03:35,930 --> 04:03:36,170
We are good.

8863
04:03:39,270 --> 04:03:40,590
They are over there.

8864
04:03:40,690 --> 04:03:42,650
One team is behind and one team is up there.

8865
04:03:42,910 --> 04:03:44,430
It's safe but not really.

8866
04:03:44,570 --> 04:03:46,950
Is there anyone still in that other house?

8867
04:03:47,070 --> 04:03:47,330
Yeah.

8868
04:03:48,890 --> 04:03:50,150
We need these two teams to fight.

8869
04:03:50,410 --> 04:03:52,490
They are using us as a buffer.

8870
04:03:52,970 --> 04:03:53,410
Yeah.

8871
04:03:53,470 --> 04:03:53,670
That's fine.

8872
04:03:53,770 --> 04:03:55,910
Follow me.

8873
04:03:56,630 --> 04:03:59,010
You want me to scan or you want me to see?

8874
04:03:59,450 --> 04:04:00,230
Tempo come first.

8875
04:04:00,490 --> 04:04:02,210
They needed that door.

8876
04:04:02,810 --> 04:04:03,250
Yeah.

8877
04:04:03,710 --> 04:04:04,530
We are good.

8878
04:04:04,730 --> 04:04:07,210
Do you want me to scan west or east?

8879
04:04:08,350 --> 04:04:09,110
I'm going to be honest.

8880
04:04:09,270 --> 04:04:10,450
Scan west side every time.

8881
04:04:10,690 --> 04:04:12,050
Scan this way.

8882
04:04:12,270 --> 04:04:13,830
That team is gone.

8883
04:04:15,150 --> 04:04:15,830
Oh wait.

8884
04:04:15,870 --> 04:04:16,310
Never mind.

8885
04:04:17,790 --> 04:04:19,210
They are going to probably finish her off.

8886
04:04:19,310 --> 04:04:19,990
They are on our first floor.

8887
04:04:19,990 --> 04:04:20,370
Come on.

8888
04:04:20,510 --> 04:04:21,750
We are good.

8889
04:04:23,730 --> 04:04:25,090
I'm watching first floor from up here.

8890
04:04:25,190 --> 04:04:25,730
They are going to fight soon.

8891
04:04:25,970 --> 04:04:27,210
I have a scan at five.

8892
04:04:28,230 --> 04:04:28,850
We are good.

8893
04:04:29,590 --> 04:04:31,050
We just hold our second floor with everything we have.

8894
04:04:31,470 --> 04:04:33,070
I should have met 50 gifted.

8895
04:04:33,170 --> 04:04:33,610
What the fuck?

8896
04:04:33,810 --> 04:04:34,150
Don't say that.

8897
04:04:34,150 --> 04:04:35,130
Don't say that.

8898
04:04:35,670 --> 04:04:36,870
You are trolling.

8899
04:04:37,030 --> 04:04:37,710
Lock in.

8900
04:04:37,810 --> 04:04:38,050
Lock in.

8901
04:04:39,390 --> 04:04:39,730
Tempo.

8902
04:04:39,730 --> 04:04:40,770
Get another barrel on the balcony.

8903
04:04:40,910 --> 04:04:41,550
Get another barrel on the balcony.

8904
04:04:41,830 --> 04:04:45,270
They can't really shoot out that easily.

8905
04:04:47,370 --> 04:04:48,570
I'm watching the window down here.

8906
04:04:49,030 --> 04:04:49,370
Okay.

8907
04:04:50,170 --> 04:04:51,170
We are staying up here.

8908
04:04:51,830 --> 04:04:52,970
Are they on the roof right now or no?

8909
04:04:53,730 --> 04:04:54,070
No.

8910
04:04:54,990 --> 04:04:55,710
That's great for us.

8911
04:04:56,030 --> 04:04:57,830
Someone needs it.

8912
04:04:57,970 --> 04:04:59,090
I'm good.

8913
04:04:59,090 --> 04:04:59,530
I'm going to try.

8914
04:05:01,430 --> 04:05:02,330
Someone has a Kraber.

8915
04:05:03,650 --> 04:05:04,670
We just stay inside.

8916
04:05:04,970 --> 04:05:05,950
We don't really stay inside.

8917
04:05:06,370 --> 04:05:06,690
Tempo.

8918
04:05:07,170 --> 04:05:08,510
Can you move this barrel?

8919
04:05:08,650 --> 04:05:08,970
This one.

8920
04:05:09,090 --> 04:05:10,190
And put it right next to the door right here.

8921
04:05:12,390 --> 04:05:13,870
I hear a lot of blood.

8922
04:05:14,170 --> 04:05:14,850
Let them do it.

8923
04:05:14,990 --> 04:05:15,690
We are good guys.

8924
04:05:18,130 --> 04:05:19,090
Don't go out.

8925
04:05:19,890 --> 04:05:20,290
Don't go out.

8926
04:05:20,390 --> 04:05:20,770
Let them die.

8927
04:05:22,230 --> 04:05:23,610
There is literally no reason to kill.

8928
04:05:23,650 --> 04:05:24,190
We have two KPs.

8929
04:05:24,730 --> 04:05:25,470
Let them fight everything.

8930
04:05:25,750 --> 04:05:26,170
We are good.

8931
04:05:29,090 --> 04:05:29,610
We are doing great.

8932
04:05:30,270 --> 04:05:30,770
Phenomenal guys.

8933
04:05:33,990 --> 04:05:35,010
They put a barrel on the roof.

8934
04:05:35,010 --> 04:05:36,090
I'm still staring first floor.

8935
04:05:36,890 --> 04:05:38,130
They put a barrel on the roof.

8936
04:05:38,270 --> 04:05:39,450
I broke it.

8937
04:05:40,070 --> 04:05:41,230
I'm about to surrender here I think.

8938
04:05:41,910 --> 04:05:42,970
Do you need surrender?

8939
04:05:43,210 --> 04:05:43,570
No.

8940
04:05:44,170 --> 04:05:44,650
I'm good.

8941
04:05:46,130 --> 04:05:47,870
I have two ulti cells for you.

8942
04:05:49,290 --> 04:05:49,650
Okay.

8943
04:05:50,430 --> 04:05:51,890
I do not.

8944
04:05:51,970 --> 04:05:52,810
I have full ult.

8945
04:05:53,550 --> 04:05:55,750
I have not used my ult once.

8946
04:05:57,190 --> 04:05:58,510
There is just a random...

8947
04:05:59,990 --> 04:06:00,390
I'm just chilling.

8948
04:06:01,250 --> 04:06:01,510
We are fine.

8949
04:06:01,710 --> 04:06:05,330
They must be so confused with me staying up here.

8950
04:06:07,770 --> 04:06:09,470
We are all good.

8951
04:06:09,610 --> 04:06:09,690
We are all good.

8952
04:06:09,690 --> 04:06:10,270
We are all good.

8953
04:06:10,310 --> 04:06:10,930
Just keep scanning.

8954
04:06:11,790 --> 04:06:12,190
Wait.

8955
04:06:15,010 --> 04:06:16,230
Doki, grab the helm.

8956
04:06:17,130 --> 04:06:18,050
You are over there.

8957
04:06:18,690 --> 04:06:19,730
I have it already.

8958
04:06:20,250 --> 04:06:21,710
Scan the roof a little bit.

8959
04:06:22,230 --> 04:06:24,610
There is one up there.

8960
04:06:24,730 --> 04:06:25,730
There is one up there.

8961
04:06:27,090 --> 04:06:28,010
I see them.

8962
04:06:28,470 --> 04:06:29,110
Top five.

8963
04:06:29,190 --> 04:06:29,910
Do we need three?

8964
04:06:30,650 --> 04:06:30,970
Probably.

8965
04:06:34,350 --> 04:06:35,550
I'm just going to look for more KP.

8966
04:06:36,510 --> 04:06:38,570
There are two guys on the outside.

8967
04:06:39,210 --> 04:06:40,430
There is someone going to end right in front of us.

8968
04:06:40,510 --> 04:06:40,870
We are good right now.

8969
04:06:42,050 --> 04:06:43,110
Full team on the roof.

8970
04:06:44,930 --> 04:06:46,450
There is a team on that door.

8971
04:06:47,390 --> 04:06:47,410
Okay.

8972
04:06:48,030 --> 04:06:50,950
Do we try to grab the roof and then...

8973
04:06:50,950 --> 04:06:51,370
No.

8974
04:06:51,390 --> 04:06:52,190
They are on the roof.

8975
04:06:52,610 --> 04:06:54,510
There is a full three men in this costume.

8976
04:06:54,710 --> 04:06:55,370
How do we get out of here?

8977
04:06:55,890 --> 04:06:57,410
We are going to jump down and go left.

8978
04:06:57,590 --> 04:06:57,870
Okay.

8979
04:06:59,510 --> 04:07:00,250
I'm going to break barrels.

8980
04:07:01,710 --> 04:07:02,270
Stay there.

8981
04:07:03,290 --> 04:07:04,610
This is nerve wracking.

8982
04:07:04,710 --> 04:07:06,670
We are going to jump down and go left on the staircase.

8983
04:07:07,050 --> 04:07:07,830
There is that one rat.

8984
04:07:07,910 --> 04:07:08,550
There is a rat right here.

8985
04:07:09,090 --> 04:07:09,370
Okay.

8986
04:07:10,770 --> 04:07:13,010
We can just rush that rat and then we could...

8987
04:07:13,530 --> 04:07:13,810
Yeah.

8988
04:07:13,810 --> 04:07:14,190
I don't know.

8989
04:07:14,810 --> 04:07:17,270
We are going to have to jump out and play this fence line on the left side.

8990
04:07:17,370 --> 04:07:17,470
Okay.

8991
04:07:18,430 --> 04:07:19,350
We are going to have to smoke.

8992
04:07:19,930 --> 04:07:20,430
I don't know.

8993
04:07:20,470 --> 04:07:21,050
He sees me.

8994
04:07:23,430 --> 04:07:24,810
We need this team to die on the right.

8995
04:07:25,730 --> 04:07:26,810
The one that is going to kill us is really fucking us to be honest.

8996
04:07:26,910 --> 04:07:27,130
Right here?

8997
04:07:27,570 --> 04:07:27,810
Yeah.

8998
04:07:27,870 --> 04:07:29,590
That team is fucking us but it's going to be really hard to do anything.

8999
04:07:29,770 --> 04:07:30,770
That's a good one I think.

9000
04:07:31,390 --> 04:07:32,350
They are putting barrels on us.

9001
04:07:32,910 --> 04:07:33,910
They are trying to trap us inside.

9002
04:07:34,230 --> 04:07:35,450
They are going to probably call us to go to the L.A.

9003
04:07:35,450 --> 04:07:35,530
game.

9004
04:07:35,870 --> 04:07:36,690
They will be smart if they did.

9005
04:07:38,190 --> 04:07:39,970
You need to start bringing these barrels outside.

9006
04:07:40,190 --> 04:07:40,970
They are putting barrels on our balcony.

9007
04:07:41,110 --> 04:07:41,530
You need to do it.

9008
04:07:41,590 --> 04:07:41,850
I can't.

9009
04:07:43,310 --> 04:07:43,890
It's on the outside.

9010
04:07:44,030 --> 04:07:44,170
I'm left.

9011
04:07:44,250 --> 04:07:44,510
Far left.

9012
04:07:44,850 --> 04:07:45,930
Just walk out and peek on the outside.

9013
04:07:46,250 --> 04:07:46,370
Yeah.

9014
04:07:47,130 --> 04:07:47,750
Right in the barrels.

9015
04:07:47,870 --> 04:07:48,070
Nice.

9016
04:07:48,170 --> 04:07:48,610
That's your job.

9017
04:07:49,330 --> 04:07:50,630
We just jump out of your left side late.

9018
04:07:50,830 --> 04:07:51,630
Let's see what these guys do.

9019
04:07:51,710 --> 04:07:52,530
They have to leave before us.

9020
04:07:53,310 --> 04:07:54,090
Let's see what these guys do.

9021
04:07:54,710 --> 04:07:56,130
I'm playing my life no matter what.

9022
04:07:56,150 --> 04:07:56,830
Me too.

9023
04:07:58,710 --> 04:07:59,510
We stay alive here.

9024
04:08:00,090 --> 04:08:04,470
Can you scan underneath us and see where they are?

9025
04:08:04,590 --> 04:08:04,850
On the left side.

9026
04:08:04,990 --> 04:08:06,370
They are still there.

9027
04:08:08,250 --> 04:08:09,110
Stay inside late.

9028
04:08:09,450 --> 04:08:10,430
We are going to swing out left.

9029
04:08:11,570 --> 04:08:12,910
We are going to cost these kids too late.

9030
04:08:12,910 --> 04:08:13,190
Right side.

9031
04:08:13,790 --> 04:08:14,630
Play here slow.

9032
04:08:16,230 --> 04:08:17,210
I need them on the right side.

9033
04:08:17,310 --> 04:08:18,050
I'll just kill them on the right side.

9034
04:08:19,510 --> 04:08:20,150
I'm here.

9035
04:08:22,730 --> 04:08:23,370
Kill them.

9036
04:08:24,470 --> 04:08:24,790
Nice.

9037
04:08:26,470 --> 04:08:27,110
Top three.

9038
04:08:27,470 --> 04:08:28,070
Stay behind.

9039
04:08:28,670 --> 04:08:29,090
Do we make it?

9040
04:08:30,190 --> 04:08:30,670
Do we make it?

9041
04:08:34,590 --> 04:08:35,230
11 points.

9042
04:08:35,370 --> 04:08:36,990
That was our only play.

9043
04:08:38,850 --> 04:08:40,390
I have no idea if it's enough or not.

9044
04:08:40,510 --> 04:08:41,230
11 points is a lot.

9045
04:08:43,810 --> 04:08:44,910
Oh my god.

9046
04:08:44,950 --> 04:08:45,810
I have no idea.

9047
04:08:48,750 --> 04:08:50,030
It's going to be so close.

9048
04:08:50,070 --> 04:08:50,670
That was our only play.

9049
04:08:50,890 --> 04:08:51,730
That was...

9050
04:08:51,730 --> 04:08:52,550
Okay.

9051
04:08:54,730 --> 04:08:56,510
That was so stressful.

9052
04:08:56,890 --> 04:08:57,910
That was a miracle play.

9053
04:08:59,550 --> 04:09:00,110
No.

9054
04:09:01,010 --> 04:09:01,570
No.

9055
04:09:02,550 --> 04:09:03,490
One point.

9056
04:09:03,750 --> 04:09:04,310
No.

9057
04:09:08,630 --> 04:09:11,090
Are you kidding me?

9058
04:09:11,630 --> 04:09:12,190
Wait.

9059
04:09:14,050 --> 04:09:15,350
Oh my god.

9060
04:09:15,430 --> 04:09:15,770
Wait.

9061
04:09:15,890 --> 04:09:17,950
Are we actually one...

9062
04:09:19,210 --> 04:09:19,550
Oh.

9063
04:09:20,350 --> 04:09:22,810
We got four kids.

9064
04:09:24,610 --> 04:09:27,010
We got four kids.

9065
04:09:27,110 --> 04:09:27,210
We got four kids.

9066
04:09:27,210 --> 04:09:29,330
You said top three with three kids.

9067
04:09:29,630 --> 04:09:30,070
No.

9068
04:09:31,130 --> 04:09:31,470
Really?

9069
04:09:32,410 --> 04:09:37,550
If we got one more point, we would have tied 10th place.

9070
04:09:37,670 --> 04:09:38,750
But we win the tie breaker.

9071
04:09:39,230 --> 04:09:40,890
Oh my god.

9072
04:09:41,630 --> 04:09:43,170
That's so heartbreaking.

9073
04:09:43,550 --> 04:09:44,270
GG's man.

9074
04:09:45,450 --> 04:09:46,570
We did a good job.

9075
04:09:46,650 --> 04:09:47,810
We did a good job.

9076
04:09:48,070 --> 04:09:50,750
That was the one, man.

9077
04:09:51,130 --> 04:09:53,110
That was the fucking one, bro.

9078
04:09:53,510 --> 04:09:55,690
We even tempoed your calculations.

9079
04:09:57,010 --> 04:09:57,310
No.

9080
04:09:57,870 --> 04:09:59,570
Tempo was low key almost right though.

9081
04:09:59,710 --> 04:09:59,870
Yeah.

9082
04:10:00,290 --> 04:10:03,610
We really only just needed to get a fucking snag of KP somewhere else.

9083
04:10:03,610 --> 04:10:04,390
We needed one more cape.

9084
04:10:04,970 --> 04:10:06,210
There was no way.

9085
04:10:06,290 --> 04:10:07,110
We're so broke.

9086
04:10:08,490 --> 04:10:11,570
The 10th place team will randomly...

9087
04:10:11,570 --> 04:10:13,190
What did 10th place get last game?

9088
04:10:14,010 --> 04:10:15,370
What did 10th place get last game?

9089
04:10:16,810 --> 04:10:17,770
Oh, no.

9090
04:10:17,870 --> 04:10:19,330
They got three points last game.

9091
04:10:19,670 --> 04:10:23,270
If we got reaped last game, we fucking qual, bro.

9092
04:10:23,330 --> 04:10:24,250
Oh my god.

9093
04:10:24,630 --> 04:10:26,770
We reaped so hard.

9094
04:10:29,310 --> 04:10:32,790
I can't believe they got rid of the content team.

9095
04:10:33,650 --> 04:10:33,990
I can't believe they got rid of the content team.

9096
04:10:33,990 --> 04:10:34,250
Wait, wait.

9097
04:10:34,570 --> 04:10:35,290
Better though.

9098
04:10:35,390 --> 04:10:36,470
We did better this week.

9099
04:10:36,530 --> 04:10:37,990
We always got one.

9100
04:10:38,110 --> 04:10:39,770
Yeah, I'll see you guys next year.

9101
04:10:39,990 --> 04:10:43,030
When is the next one?

9102
04:10:43,030 --> 04:10:44,250
Is it after Split 1 playoffs?

9103
04:10:45,770 --> 04:10:46,290
Actually...

9104
04:10:47,310 --> 04:10:48,170
When's the next one?

9105
04:10:48,530 --> 04:10:49,990
Yeah, it would be after...

9106
04:10:49,990 --> 04:10:51,810
It would be like whenever...

9107
04:10:51,810 --> 04:10:52,730
So LAN is May.

9108
04:10:53,030 --> 04:10:55,750
And then Split 1...

9109
04:10:55,750 --> 04:11:00,990
Split 1 would start somewhere around the end of May or early June.

9110
04:11:01,110 --> 04:11:02,530
So I guess that would be when it is.

9111
04:11:03,050 --> 04:11:06,290
End of May or early June is when CC1 should be.

9112
04:11:06,790 --> 04:11:07,310
Okay.

9113
04:11:07,650 --> 04:11:10,210
Because they have Pro League qualifiers next week.

9114
04:11:11,110 --> 04:11:12,470
Oh my god, chat.

9115
04:11:13,030 --> 04:11:13,810
I can't believe it.

9116
04:11:13,850 --> 04:11:15,170
We were so close.

9117
04:11:15,350 --> 04:11:17,610
We literally won one point.

9118
04:11:17,770 --> 04:11:20,670
And we won the tiebreaker off of that too.

9119
04:11:20,970 --> 04:11:21,450
Oh my god.

9120
04:11:21,450 --> 04:11:23,130
We did one more KP, bro.

9121
04:11:23,390 --> 04:11:26,110
We did so good.

9122
04:11:26,210 --> 04:11:28,130
You guys did so good dropping down.

9123
04:11:28,570 --> 04:11:29,110
We got the fucking...

9124
04:11:29,110 --> 04:11:31,230
We got both KP too.

9125
04:11:31,510 --> 04:11:34,030
We got both those kills.

9126
04:11:34,210 --> 04:11:36,010
There was no way we could get third kill.

9127
04:11:36,410 --> 04:11:37,590
And then that fifth kill.

9128
04:11:38,450 --> 04:11:40,390
There's no way we could even get third place there.

9129
04:11:40,450 --> 04:11:40,790
We're just dead.

9130
04:11:43,030 --> 04:11:43,250
We were third place.

9131
04:11:43,410 --> 04:11:43,970
That's the thing.

9132
04:11:43,990 --> 04:11:44,750
I mean second.

9133
04:11:44,950 --> 04:11:45,510
We were on second.

9134
04:11:47,170 --> 04:11:50,030
There's no way we could have gotten second place.

9135
04:11:50,270 --> 04:11:51,390
I can't believe it.

9136
04:11:51,430 --> 04:11:52,990
If we didn't get grief last game.

9137
04:11:53,270 --> 04:11:54,610
Remember those names.

9138
04:11:54,810 --> 04:11:56,150
Remember those names last game.

9139
04:11:58,070 --> 04:11:59,350
That's on you.

9140
04:11:59,390 --> 04:12:03,550
I will write those names in my death note.

9141
04:12:03,730 --> 04:12:04,250
Hello?

9142
04:12:05,070 --> 04:12:05,790
End game.

9143
04:12:06,730 --> 04:12:07,650
Not doing that.

9144
04:12:08,350 --> 04:12:10,790
We're not writing any names or anything like that.

9145
04:12:10,870 --> 04:12:10,970
Bro, you're so good!

9146
04:12:12,270 --> 04:12:17,830
It sucks for you because we missed like maybe one or two KP on that team fighting in that show.

9147
04:12:17,890 --> 04:12:19,970
We got two of them but there was like one more we could have got.

9148
04:12:20,150 --> 04:12:20,490
Yeah.

9149
04:12:20,650 --> 04:12:21,990
The stars were aligning too.

9150
04:12:22,210 --> 04:12:23,150
Oh my god.

9151
04:12:23,350 --> 04:12:24,530
What a heartbreaker.

9152
04:12:24,830 --> 04:12:26,110
Bro, shit!

9153
04:12:27,650 --> 04:12:28,370
We're improving.

9154
04:12:28,570 --> 04:12:29,050
We're improving.

9155
04:12:29,190 --> 04:12:30,650
I'll see you guys next challenge.

9156
04:12:31,010 --> 04:12:32,650
I had a lot of fun this week.

9157
04:12:32,650 --> 04:12:33,230
That was good.

9158
04:12:33,410 --> 04:12:33,790
Yeah, that was fun.

9159
04:12:34,410 --> 04:12:36,090
One month break and then we run it back.

9160
04:12:36,190 --> 04:12:36,370
Yeah.

9161
04:12:36,370 --> 04:12:37,210
Oh, I'm so down.

9162
04:12:37,290 --> 04:12:37,690
You know the vibes.

9163
04:12:37,750 --> 04:12:39,550
If we make it past day one, you're all proud of us.

9164
04:12:39,570 --> 04:12:41,510
That was actually a way big improvement though.

9165
04:12:41,570 --> 04:12:42,670
Yeah, we improved so much.

9166
04:12:42,910 --> 04:12:47,590
I feel like we should have been able to get that type of game every game.

9167
04:12:47,810 --> 04:12:48,830
Okay, so here's the thing though.

9168
04:12:48,950 --> 04:12:50,790
We're going to run Valk 99% of the time.

9169
04:12:50,910 --> 04:12:51,150
Okay.

9170
04:12:51,230 --> 04:12:52,730
So on Storm Point 2 then.

9171
04:12:52,830 --> 04:12:53,130
Yes.

9172
04:12:53,130 --> 04:12:56,890
Because if we avoid all the bullshit, bro, we just get top threes.

9173
04:12:56,970 --> 04:12:58,830
Like we just literally... because I can call zones.

9174
04:12:59,310 --> 04:13:00,610
Teams won't feed you inside...

9175
04:13:00,610 --> 04:13:02,610
feed face inside of a house because it's hard to push the caustic.

9176
04:13:02,630 --> 04:13:06,350
We just need to avoid the really sketchy spots, I guess, at all costs.

9177
04:13:06,370 --> 04:13:09,510
Like if you think there's a slight chance a dumb team will push you, guess what?

9178
04:13:09,650 --> 04:13:11,270
That team is dumb and they are there.

9179
04:13:11,570 --> 04:13:11,930
Yeah.

9180
04:13:12,330 --> 04:13:12,690
Exactly.

9181
04:13:12,870 --> 04:13:13,030
Yeah.

9182
04:13:13,130 --> 04:13:17,570
So like now we know though, like we just need to play inside spots where there's just no way they push us.

9183
04:13:17,650 --> 04:13:19,470
Yeah, we need to play the caustic and just get inside.

9184
04:13:19,690 --> 04:13:21,170
We can't be pinched anywhere.

9185
04:13:21,290 --> 04:13:21,710
No, nothing.

9186
04:13:21,950 --> 04:13:23,550
Yeah, there's like no spot where you can hold space.

9187
04:13:23,710 --> 04:13:24,870
Most likely they'll fucking run at us.

9188
04:13:25,770 --> 04:13:28,290
Yeah, that's pretty fucking evident, I guess.

9189
04:13:28,590 --> 04:13:29,870
Alright, we're getting better.

9190
04:13:30,430 --> 04:13:32,890
Next challenger circuit, you're going to see us in round three.

9191
04:13:32,970 --> 04:13:33,790
I actually thought we were going to make it.

9192
04:13:33,870 --> 04:13:35,870
What did they get this game?

9193
04:13:36,370 --> 04:13:40,470
They died in tenth with zero.

9194
04:13:40,610 --> 04:13:41,370
Oh my god.

9195
04:13:41,470 --> 04:13:44,850
If they died in eleventh, one more place earlier.

9196
04:13:45,410 --> 04:13:47,150
Oh my god, that actually is unbelievable.

9197
04:13:49,090 --> 04:13:51,130
Alright, well fucking GG, Ty.

9198
04:13:51,190 --> 04:13:52,450
I'm happy we improved though.

9199
04:13:52,550 --> 04:13:53,150
We got better.

9200
04:13:53,510 --> 04:13:54,830
I'm so proud of us.

9201
04:13:54,830 --> 04:13:55,350
Good fucking shit.

9202
04:13:55,350 --> 04:13:58,990
We got so much better and we didn't have like some team that's purposely griefing us.

9203
04:13:59,070 --> 04:13:59,350
No, we landed.

9204
04:13:59,530 --> 04:13:59,990
We landed.

9205
04:14:00,210 --> 04:14:02,330
We landed lightning rod and siphon too.

9206
04:14:02,630 --> 04:14:04,790
Yeah, we got fucked over a bit.

9207
04:14:04,810 --> 04:14:06,290
We're improving on our PLR.

9208
04:14:06,290 --> 04:14:06,350
We're improving on our PLR.

9209
04:14:06,350 --> 04:14:06,350
We're improving on our PLR.

9210
04:14:06,370 --> 04:14:07,370
We're improving.

9211
04:14:07,610 --> 04:14:08,390
We're improving.

9212
04:14:09,210 --> 04:14:12,730
Also, we looked like... to be honest, we looked way more locked in this week.

9213
04:14:12,790 --> 04:14:14,710
Like breaking barrel, putting barrels down.

9214
04:14:14,890 --> 04:14:15,930
We just looked like way better.

9215
04:14:16,010 --> 04:14:17,090
Yeah, getting kills.

9216
04:14:17,710 --> 04:14:18,070
Yeah.

9217
04:14:18,250 --> 04:14:18,590
Yeah.

9218
04:14:19,970 --> 04:14:20,330
Exactly.

9219
04:14:20,650 --> 04:14:21,270
I think we did good.

9220
04:14:21,350 --> 04:14:22,230
I'm proud of us regardless.

9221
04:14:22,350 --> 04:14:22,950
We're running back though.

9222
04:14:22,950 --> 04:14:23,430
Next one, right?

9223
04:14:23,530 --> 04:14:24,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9224
04:14:24,350 --> 04:14:24,710
100%.

9225
04:14:24,710 --> 04:14:25,350
100%.

9226
04:14:25,350 --> 04:14:25,750
I'm so down.

9227
04:14:25,970 --> 04:14:27,010
I'm so fucking down.

9228
04:14:27,070 --> 04:14:27,530
You have no idea.

9229
04:14:27,530 --> 04:14:29,090
Make my Wikipedia, guys.

9230
04:14:29,270 --> 04:14:29,670
Make my...

9231
04:14:29,670 --> 04:14:29,790
Yeah.

9232
04:14:30,270 --> 04:14:31,150
Where's my Wikipedia?

9233
04:14:31,470 --> 04:14:31,990
Actually, yeah.

9234
04:14:32,010 --> 04:14:34,370
We need a... we all need... we need a Wikipedia too.

9235
04:14:34,410 --> 04:14:35,170
Yeah, we're official.

9236
04:14:35,410 --> 04:14:36,110
We're official.

9237
04:14:36,130 --> 04:14:36,350
We're official.

9238
04:14:36,350 --> 04:14:37,890
We're an official team signed by TSM.

9239
04:14:38,330 --> 04:14:39,510
Yeah, lowkey sexist.

9240
04:14:39,530 --> 04:14:40,130
She doesn't have one yet.

9241
04:14:40,170 --> 04:14:40,670
I don't want to say it.

9242
04:14:40,770 --> 04:14:41,090
Wait a minute.

9243
04:14:41,090 --> 04:14:41,590
Wait a minute.

9244
04:14:41,750 --> 04:14:42,470
We took off... wait.

9245
04:14:42,570 --> 04:14:43,070
Wait a minute.

9246
04:14:43,170 --> 04:14:43,890
We took off the tag.

9247
04:14:44,110 --> 04:14:44,970
Yeah, no, no, no.

9248
04:14:45,070 --> 04:14:48,510
And then we got let go by TSM because we failed the... we've got it.

9249
04:14:48,570 --> 04:14:48,750
True.

9250
04:14:48,770 --> 04:14:48,850
True.

9251
04:14:49,210 --> 04:14:52,250
We only get signed while we're playing and then we got let go in between.

9252
04:14:52,530 --> 04:14:52,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9253
04:14:52,750 --> 04:14:54,190
Yeah, we got let go because we didn't make it.

9254
04:14:54,270 --> 04:14:54,570
So...

9255
04:14:55,110 --> 04:14:56,290
We're free agents now.

9256
04:14:56,410 --> 04:14:57,110
We're free agents.

9257
04:14:57,490 --> 04:14:58,570
We did so good.

9258
04:14:59,290 --> 04:14:59,790
It's okay.

9259
04:14:59,870 --> 04:15:00,790
Next challenge is Circuit.

9260
04:15:00,910 --> 04:15:01,590
We're going to run it back.

9261
04:15:02,850 --> 04:15:03,170
Yes.

9262
04:15:03,170 --> 04:15:03,490
100%.

9263
04:15:03,490 --> 04:15:04,310
I wonder what the meta will be then.

9264
04:15:04,390 --> 04:15:04,730
Who knows?

9265
04:15:04,870 --> 04:15:05,150
Let's see.

9266
04:15:05,150 --> 04:15:05,430
Yeah.

9267
04:15:05,790 --> 04:15:06,150
Yeah.

9268
04:15:06,190 --> 04:15:07,050
Okay, we'll stick with this.

9269
04:15:07,290 --> 04:15:08,850
No, no, we are not sticking with this.

9270
04:15:09,670 --> 04:15:10,490
I don't know.

9271
04:15:10,510 --> 04:15:11,850
We might need this Caustic Bound Blood.

9272
04:15:12,410 --> 04:15:13,150
Caustic Bound Blood.

9273
04:15:13,370 --> 04:15:14,890
Caustic Bound Blood all the time.

9274
04:15:15,570 --> 04:15:15,810
Okay.

9275
04:15:15,850 --> 04:15:16,150
It's okay.

9276
04:15:16,430 --> 04:15:20,550
That's why we're like... we're not going to do the NA strat where after one bad tournament, we break up.

9277
04:15:20,830 --> 04:15:21,450
No, never.

9278
04:15:21,490 --> 04:15:21,850
We should never.

9279
04:15:23,110 --> 04:15:24,950
That means we're staying together forever.

9280
04:15:25,070 --> 04:15:25,950
We're rivals too, right?

9281
04:15:26,110 --> 04:15:26,270
Yeah.

9282
04:15:26,310 --> 04:15:26,670
Okay.

9283
04:15:27,050 --> 04:15:27,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9284
04:15:28,870 --> 04:15:33,010
I mean, if I need to win money one month to pay a mortgage, I'm sorry.

9285
04:15:33,750 --> 04:15:34,690
Hey, hey, hey.

9286
04:15:34,790 --> 04:15:35,130
Hey, hey, hey.

9287
04:15:35,150 --> 04:15:35,950
I mean, look.

9288
04:15:36,090 --> 04:15:37,350
I mean, it's...

9289
04:15:37,350 --> 04:15:37,870
All right, all right.

9290
04:15:37,970 --> 04:15:39,150
...extract rivals might be random.

9291
04:15:39,330 --> 04:15:39,870
We don't know that.

9292
04:15:40,050 --> 04:15:42,130
This Twitch Rivals was an anomaly.

9293
04:15:42,370 --> 04:15:46,110
Every other Twitch Rivals we've played, we've been like middle of the pack.

9294
04:15:46,210 --> 04:15:47,950
What do you mean every... we've done one.

9295
04:15:48,390 --> 04:15:49,350
We've done one together.

9296
04:15:49,550 --> 04:15:53,770
What do you mean every other... this is our... that last one was our second.

9297
04:15:54,310 --> 04:15:55,770
What is this data pool?

9298
04:15:55,870 --> 04:15:57,410
We have two Twitch Rivals together.

9299
04:15:57,730 --> 04:16:01,810
I remember playing like four Twitch Rivals and I kept getting in the middle.

9300
04:16:01,830 --> 04:16:05,110
No, we played... I played one... two Twitch Rivals with you.

9301
04:16:05,130 --> 04:16:05,350
You guys.

9302
04:16:05,630 --> 04:16:06,150
Not four.

9303
04:16:06,610 --> 04:16:07,730
Oh, I might have played two.

9304
04:16:07,830 --> 04:16:09,190
I might have played two without you then.

9305
04:16:09,230 --> 04:16:10,770
Yeah, I probably done better than the two with us.

9306
04:16:11,010 --> 04:16:11,650
Yeah, you...

9307
04:16:12,770 --> 04:16:13,490
Oh, damn.

9308
04:16:14,670 --> 04:16:16,830
So, Doki was the one that was like, oh, no.

9309
04:16:17,130 --> 04:16:17,890
What do you mean?

9310
04:16:17,970 --> 04:16:18,690
Money is on the line.

9311
04:16:18,750 --> 04:16:19,690
We play someone else.

9312
04:16:19,870 --> 04:16:21,030
But I plays better.

9313
04:16:21,890 --> 04:16:22,250
Oh.

9314
04:16:22,810 --> 04:16:23,170
Whoa.

9315
04:16:24,190 --> 04:16:24,550
Whoa.

9316
04:16:24,730 --> 04:16:25,850
Yeah, we talking shit.

9317
04:16:26,670 --> 04:16:27,030
Wow.

9318
04:16:27,030 --> 04:16:29,810
I've placed higher definitely before.

9319
04:16:30,470 --> 04:16:31,250
Oh, I understand.

9320
04:16:31,350 --> 04:16:32,110
That's a better doubt.

9321
04:16:32,310 --> 04:16:34,030
I think Doki has more earnings than Teppo.

9322
04:16:34,150 --> 04:16:35,090
We can earn each other that.

9323
04:16:35,090 --> 04:16:35,610
I'm pretty sure.

9324
04:16:35,630 --> 04:16:36,870
My Liquipedia is out there.

9325
04:16:37,050 --> 04:16:38,570
I definitely have more earnings.

9326
04:16:38,670 --> 04:16:39,050
Alright, that's it.

9327
04:16:40,130 --> 04:16:40,530
Liquipedia.

9328
04:16:40,990 --> 04:16:42,710
I don't have a Liquipedia.

9329
04:16:42,850 --> 04:16:43,590
That's the thing.

9330
04:16:43,610 --> 04:16:44,230
Wait, you don't what?

9331
04:16:44,390 --> 04:16:46,170
I don't have one because they removed it.

9332
04:16:46,170 --> 04:16:47,430
Not even under... Oh.

9333
04:16:47,910 --> 04:16:49,110
Wait, they removed it?

9334
04:16:49,170 --> 04:16:49,910
They got removed.

9335
04:16:50,090 --> 04:16:51,570
They removed it because they were like...

9336
04:16:51,570 --> 04:16:53,650
Wait, so you had one but then they removed it.

9337
04:16:53,710 --> 04:16:56,670
Yeah, because they were like, it's not... the tournaments aren't official enough.

9338
04:16:57,010 --> 04:16:58,250
So, they removed my Liquipedia.

9339
04:16:58,810 --> 04:16:58,870
This one's official, right?

9340
04:16:59,070 --> 04:17:01,310
Yeah, but they still don't make it for me.

9341
04:17:02,450 --> 04:17:04,950
The moderators hate me because I'm an anime girl.

9342
04:17:04,950 --> 04:17:05,070
I think we have to win this.

9343
04:17:05,070 --> 04:17:06,790
You win money from an official tournament.

9344
04:17:07,670 --> 04:17:11,870
That means we have to get into Pro League and then get...

9345
04:17:11,870 --> 04:17:14,990
I literally win more money in unofficial tournaments.

9346
04:17:16,110 --> 04:17:16,870
For sure.

9347
04:17:17,030 --> 04:17:17,770
You definitely do.

9348
04:17:17,870 --> 04:17:18,530
Without a fucking...

9349
04:17:18,530 --> 04:17:23,870
Unofficial Apex tournaments pay more than official.

9350
04:17:23,870 --> 04:17:24,530
Without a doubt.

9351
04:17:25,490 --> 04:17:26,010
100%.

9352
04:17:26,010 --> 04:17:26,970
That's sad.

9353
04:17:27,430 --> 04:17:27,990
You're so right.

9354
04:17:29,470 --> 04:17:30,570
I deserve it.

9355
04:17:30,850 --> 04:17:31,890
GG's guys though.

9356
04:17:31,930 --> 04:17:32,290
GG's.

9357
04:17:32,290 --> 04:17:32,970
Alright, GG's though.

9358
04:17:33,070 --> 04:17:33,790
I love you all, man.

9359
04:17:33,810 --> 04:17:34,830
I love you guys so much.

9360
04:17:35,070 --> 04:17:35,570
Thanks for playing.

9361
04:17:35,730 --> 04:17:38,210
I appreciate... I know I'm not the best, but I appreciate y'all for hanging out.

9362
04:17:38,310 --> 04:17:40,430
No, you were great IGLs.

9363
04:17:40,430 --> 04:17:40,930
You did great.

9364
04:17:40,930 --> 04:17:43,490
You got us into the zone every single time.

9365
04:17:43,670 --> 04:17:44,190
Thank you.

9366
04:17:44,230 --> 04:17:44,550
We tried.

9367
04:17:44,750 --> 04:17:48,590
By the way, I bet 50 lunches on that zone poll last time.

9368
04:17:48,730 --> 04:17:51,670
I just... you guys... my mic just cut out and you guys just didn't hear it.

9369
04:17:52,170 --> 04:17:59,890
I'm just gonna say, the fact that we did better than nine other teams who scrim a lot together and who like do this for a living.

9370
04:18:00,070 --> 04:18:02,110
Like, I feel like, you know...

9371
04:18:02,110 --> 04:18:04,370
Doki plays the game once a week.

9372
04:18:04,370 --> 04:18:04,530
Yeah.

9373
04:18:04,630 --> 04:18:05,010
That's weird.

9374
04:18:05,750 --> 04:18:07,630
That's what... that's when we play this.

9375
04:18:07,730 --> 04:18:09,450
I think I play less than anybody else.

9376
04:18:09,490 --> 04:18:14,050
Yeah, I literally... we literally don't even scrim and we did better than like nine other teams?

9377
04:18:14,130 --> 04:18:14,910
That's on them.

9378
04:18:15,150 --> 04:18:16,390
No, we did so good.

9379
04:18:16,530 --> 04:18:17,410
That was fucking fantastic.

9380
04:18:17,410 --> 04:18:17,930
That was pretty good.

9381
04:18:18,610 --> 04:18:21,170
Worst part about that, if that's a trio down below and we kill them, we win.

9382
04:18:21,250 --> 04:18:21,610
Yeah.

9383
04:18:22,310 --> 04:18:24,030
We kill a duo, which sucks.

9384
04:18:24,210 --> 04:18:25,190
Yeah, we... it was a duo.

9385
04:18:25,190 --> 04:18:25,510
It's coming up.

9386
04:18:25,510 --> 04:18:26,910
It's coming up where we jumped off.

9387
04:18:27,070 --> 04:18:27,970
No, oh no.

9388
04:18:28,010 --> 04:18:29,090
They're gonna be like, no!

9389
04:18:30,550 --> 04:18:31,830
Alright, GG's though, guys.

9390
04:18:32,010 --> 04:18:32,410
GG's.

9391
04:18:32,410 --> 04:18:32,950
Alright, GG's.

9392
04:18:32,970 --> 04:18:33,590
I love y'all, man.

9393
04:18:33,590 --> 04:18:34,510
Bye-bye.

9394
04:18:34,530 --> 04:18:36,030
I'm gonna go talk to my chat and cry.

9395
04:18:36,130 --> 04:18:37,170
Love you guys so much.

9396
04:18:37,230 --> 04:18:37,550
Yeah, I'll talk to my chat.

9397
04:18:37,610 --> 04:18:38,710
It'll be a 10-minute delay.

9398
04:18:39,070 --> 04:18:40,170
I'll see you guys later.

9399
04:18:40,390 --> 04:18:40,490
Bye.

9400
04:18:40,490 --> 04:18:41,330
Oh yeah, 10-minute delay.

9401
04:18:41,570 --> 04:18:41,810
Bye.

9402
04:18:41,810 --> 04:18:42,390
Love y'all.

9403
04:18:44,130 --> 04:18:45,130
Oh my god.

9404
04:18:45,290 --> 04:18:45,970
We were so close.

9405
04:18:46,410 --> 04:18:51,050
But we already played Apex for like four hours now.

9406
04:18:51,270 --> 04:18:54,390
So I'm just happy we did really well.

9407
04:18:54,610 --> 04:18:57,810
I feel like we're improving more and more as a team.

9408
04:18:59,750 --> 04:19:01,990
And it's like our character arc.

9409
04:19:02,190 --> 04:19:03,570
Each challenger circuit you go.

9410
04:19:03,590 --> 04:19:04,890
You see us get better and better.

9411
04:19:05,090 --> 04:19:06,450
So you're here for the journey.

9412
04:19:06,670 --> 04:19:08,410
You're gonna see us in round three.

9413
04:19:08,470 --> 04:19:09,490
Next challenger circuit.

9414
04:19:09,630 --> 04:19:10,190
Which is like what?

9415
04:19:10,230 --> 04:19:11,390
In like two to three months or something.

9416
04:19:11,650 --> 04:19:12,490
Don't worry, guys.

9417
04:19:13,170 --> 04:19:13,830
Don't worry.

9418
04:19:14,230 --> 04:19:15,390
Next challenger circuit.

9419
04:19:15,650 --> 04:19:16,730
It is a character arc.

9420
04:19:16,750 --> 04:19:18,370
You're here for the besties journey.

9421
04:19:18,750 --> 04:19:20,870
We're gonna have the revenge revenge arc.

9422
04:19:21,010 --> 04:19:21,990
I believe in us.

9423
04:19:24,270 --> 04:19:29,050
Anyway, thank you guys as always for supporting us and for watching me.

9424
04:19:29,250 --> 04:19:30,650

9425
04:19:30,710 --> 04:19:32,290

9426

Do have fun just hanging out and like talking shit with the besties.

9429
04:19:42,510 --> 04:19:44,150
Because it's like our hangout session.

9430
04:19:44,530 --> 04:19:46,930
It's not just like a competitive tournament.

It's literally a hangout session too.

9432

But yes, thank you, Dragoons.

9433
04:19:51,650 --> 04:19:56,530
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

9434
04:19:56,670 --> 04:19:59,610
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

9435
04:19:59,690 --> 04:20:00,750
