Someone in my chat was like, Why is she playing Seer?

100
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,130
Cause Seer is meta!

101
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,810
Oh really?

102
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,190
Oh, meta?

103
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,270
Seer is...

104
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,210
You know how original Seer was really broken?

105
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,290
Mhm.

106
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,690
They changed it back.

107
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,950
So now he's like the original Seer.

108
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,830
One team.

109
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,430

Why?

196

Yeah, because it's harder to get armor.

197
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,120
So, RE, Hammerpoint, plus Digi.

198
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Hmm?

199
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,980
So, everyone...

200
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,480
RE 45 and Hammerpoint is so strong.

201
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,100
Um, did you say...

202
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,340
Yeah, cause Digi is now on pistol.

203
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,540
Crystal.

204
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,620
Oh yes, yes, yes.

205
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,520
So no SMG.

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,780
I see, I see.

207
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,720
Do I have anybody here?

208
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,620
Okay, I leave you guys.

209
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,920
If I die...

210
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,760
It's Uto's fault.

211
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
Don't let me die, Uto.

212
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,240
Uto, I'm coming.

213
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,860
I should scan too.

214
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,000
I need a cell.

215
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,300
You need a cell?

216
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,140
Here.

217
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Yes.

218
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,260
Oh, where?

219
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
I have a hemlock.

220
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,300
Hemlock?

221
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Yeah, hemlock.

222
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,200
Where?

223
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,780
Hemlock.

224
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,400
You want hemlock or you hear hemlock?

225
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,640
No, I will play hemlock.

226
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,120
Oh, okay.

227
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,120
I have hemlock right now.

228
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:52,920
Nice.

229
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,780
I hear...

230
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,320
I hear...

231
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,600
I hear 30-30 is still strong.

232
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,520
Ah, 30-30?

233
00:09:59,640 --> 00:09:59,840
Okay.

234
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,580
Yeah, 30-30, hemlock...

235
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,040
Flatline?

236
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, flatline is strong.

237
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,380
And then short range is like RE45 now.

238
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,080
And vault.

239
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,680
Vault is always strong though.

240
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Enemy scan.

241
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,480
Enemy scan?

242
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:18,860
Where?

243
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,760
Where?

244
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:20,900
Where?

245
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,240
Where?

246
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,120
Oh, yeah!

247
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,980
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

248
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,060
I... I...

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm here.

250
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:29,880
K, K.

251
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,980
They know.

252
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:31,700
Whoa!

253
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,100
Go!

254
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:32,840
Go!

255
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,500
Here.

256
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,300
Almost K.

257
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,660
I see.

258
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh.

259
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,020
Oh, hey, RE.

260
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
K, K, K.

261
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,280
Oh, on me, on me.

262
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,460
You here?

263
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,320
Oh, shit.

264
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,540
It's like K, it's K.

265
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,380
Behind us?

266
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,600
Flash, flash, flash.

267
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,040
Flash, flash?

268
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,780
Oh, shit.

269
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,900
Oh my god.

270
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,080
I almost kicked one.

271
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm coming, I'm coming over here.

272
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:54,980
Yeah!

273
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,420
Oh, no!

274
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm dead.

275
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,720
Goodbye.

276
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,360
Oh, shit.

277
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,120
Oh.

278
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,180
Yeah.

279
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,280
Pally.

280
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,260
Can't do it.

281
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,500
He's lit, he's lit.

282
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,440
He's lit, yeah.

283
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,080
Oh, no.

284
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,180
My shoe is broken.

285
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
My shoe is gonna bolt.

286
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:19,860
Okay.

287
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,880
No!

288
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,060
He shot me, dude!

289
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,060
I wanted to have a reset.

290
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,520
The Pally is so good!

291
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,220
Yeah, the Pally is...

292
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm so sorry.

293
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,780
I shouldn't get a flat tire.

294
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,480
No!

295
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,840
You got father!

296
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,100
Okay.

297
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,420
I should have queued.

298
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,020
I should have queued.

299
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,060
I get pinged!

300
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,440
Ping!

301
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,020
Ping!

302
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,600
Oh my god.

303
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,360
We are warming up.

304
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,340
We are warming up.

305
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,280
Warm up, warm up, warm up.

306
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,920
Let's warm up.

307
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

308
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,440
Warm up until when?

309
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
We're not bad.

310
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,060
It was ping.

311
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,420
Okay, look.

312
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,440
Uto is playing with 300 ping.

313
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,080
Ditto is playing with 300 ping.

314
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,600
And I'm playing with 400 ping.

315
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,020
Right?

316
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,220
Yes, yes, yes.

317
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,060
We're all playing with really bad ping.

319
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,780
I'm just this one.

320
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,860
It's okay.

321
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,380
Don't worry.

322
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,280
Champion next game.

323
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,100
Okay.

324
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,460
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,780
Yeah, like...

326
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,280
The number you see right now, that's not true.

327
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm playing with 400 ping.

328
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm playing with 300 ping.

329
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,540
But we're so good.

331
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,960
Even when we have high ping, we're so good.

332
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,280
Yes.

333
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,720
Yeah, Uto...

334
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,380
She's a pro player, and she plays with 300 ping every day.

335
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,600
Yeah, and...

336
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,000
She's doing this game every week.

337
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
I saw it.

338
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
Yeah, you know right now, she's not playing with her monitor on.

339
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,480
Turn on your monitor.

340
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,700
Turn on your screen.

341
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,520
She plays with only sound.

342
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,760
Only sound.

343
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,220
Yeah.

344
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,560
Only ears.

345
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,340
Yeah, only ears.

346
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,420
She's so good.

347
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,500
Use your hands too.

348
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,660
Don't use your feet, okay?

349
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,740
Yeah, play with your hands, Uto.

351
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,360
Yeah, play with your hands.

352
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,520
I know you're really good.

353
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,000
That's why she's a pro.

354
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,360
The handle.

355
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,040
Okay, okay, okay.

356
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,880
Screen is on, hands on the mouse.

357
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,140
Uto, you can go anywhere.

358
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,480
Okay.

359
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,420
Okay.

360
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,760
I'm getting a bit thirsty.

361
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,120
Yeah.

362
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,700
You're really low.

363
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,740
So low.

364
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Are you getting up?

365
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,400
So low.

366
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,020
Who's that?

367
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,820
But you made it.

368
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,620
Yeah.

369
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:24,880
Well, well.

370
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,840
Anyone here?

371
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,420
Here.

372
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,500
I don't think I see anybody.

373
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,960
I think.

374
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,220
I see one team in countdown.

375
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,420
Oh, countdown?

376
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,780
Uto is going to kill them first.

377
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,720
Uto, you go countdown.

379
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,080
Go to countdown, Uto.

380
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,280
Countdown?

381
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,140
Yeah, go to countdown.

382
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,760
Kill them all.

383
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,540
Kill them all.

384
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,480
We loot, you kill.

385
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,800
I got power.

386
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,820
I got power.

387
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,340
Where are the enemies?

388
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,020
Where are the enemies?

389
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,100
Oh, countdown.

390
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,680
Careful.

391
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,880
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,080
Yeah, you go now and then we loot.

393
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,280
Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,800
Go!

395
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,300
I believe in you, Uto.

396
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,280
You're so strong.

397
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,240
It'll be white armor.

398
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,960
It'll be easy.

399
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,120
So easy.

400
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,960
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,120
I'm going, I'm going, cheer.

402
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,140
Wait, you're going?

Okay, I'm looting.

404
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
I'm looting.

405
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,000
This is important.

406
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,240
We're fighting, we're fighting.

407
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,520
Okay, okay, okay.

408
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,740
You're pro at Pred.

409
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,780
You don't need me.

410
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,700
Oh, right, right, right.

411
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,460
We don't need you.

412
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:46,940
We don't need you.

413
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,180
Yeah, one pro player can kill three people.

414
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,020
See?

415
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,920
You don't need me.

416
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:53,640
Oh, oh.

417
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,200
You, you.

418
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,780
Nice, Uto.

419
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,740
Nice, Uto.

420
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,680
Nice.

421
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,380
See?

422
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,340
Why am I here?

423
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,620
Right here, right here, right here.

424
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,580
Right here, right here.

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,540
Oh, shit!

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,440
Oh, man.

429
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,440
Wait.

430
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,440
What?

431
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,000
Wait, wait.

432
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,820
Where?

433
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,020
Right, right.

434
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,300
Is this a dead body?

435
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,040
Wait, wait, wait.

436
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,680
Okay, I'm ping, I'm ping, I'm ping.

437
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,040

438
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,820

439
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,480
Oh, I'm FBs.

440
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:22,540
Oh, okay.

441
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,060
On top, okay.

442
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,340
Maybe the last one?

443
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm not sure.

445
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm looking.

446
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,420
I don't see anybody in scan.

447
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,960
Oh, here, here.

448
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,580
What the fuck?

449
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,500
Almost hit, almost hit.

450
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm running.

451
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,380
I'm running.

452
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,460
I'm late.

453
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,480

454
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,900
Come, come, come.

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,340
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

461
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,800
Right side, right side.

462
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,840
Where is he?

463
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,040
Did he run?

464
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,540
Here, yes.

465
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,800
Okay, I'm gonna loot.

466
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,340
You guys will be fine.

467
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,240
Okay, we can kill.

468
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,520
Shit.

469
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,320
You'll be fine.

470
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,400
You don't need me.

471
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:00,800
We can, we can.

472
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,440
You can kill them.

473
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,580
Loot is important.

474
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,640
Look at all this loot.

475
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,620
Are you still fighting?

476
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,040
Oh no, you killed them!

477
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,580
No, I thirsted.

478
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,060
No, no, no, no.

479
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,140
I thirst.

480
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,540
No one's dead.

481
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,380
You guys will be fine.

482
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,860
He's lucky.

483
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,740
He's lucky.

484
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,600
It's okay.

485
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,340
We kill him again.

486
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,800
We just wanna go...

487
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,680
Let them live and we kill them.

488
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

489
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,080
Let them rest.

490
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,560
We won't get KP'd.

491
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,400
But we just wanna kill them.

492
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,880
You guys wanna...

493
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,840
Let's just take a fire scheme.

494
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,200
Yeah, let's go here.

495
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,900
Okay, I'm gonna scan the lane.

496
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,740
Oi!

497
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,300
Hey!

498
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,540
What?

499
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,100
Don't forget to pick up that wine.

500
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,560
Yeah, I'll go pick it up.

501
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,680
Okay, okay, okay.

502
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,560
Don't worry.

503
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,840
Let's upgrade our...

504
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,640
My army.

505
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,720
Yay!

506
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,920
Oh, upgrade.

507
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,340

508
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,520
My two.

509
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,660
Backpack?

510
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,020
I need the backpack.

511
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,080
Backpack?

512
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,660
Wait, what are you...

513
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,380
Oh, you have no backpack.

514
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,040
Okay.

515
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,260
No backpack.

516
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,900
Wait, wait, no.

517
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,660
Let's go to...

518
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

519
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,980
Oh, nice.

520
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,920
I found it.

521
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,500
Wait, can I...

522
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,840
You already scanned ring, right?

523
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:50,920
Yeah.

524
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Oh, yeah, you did.

525
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,920
Alright, let's go get vault.

526
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,280
Oh, there's people here.

527
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,200
Let's go.

528
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,860
Wait, wait.

529
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,620
Get vault first.

530
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,180
Vault.

531
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Okay.

532
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,040
Yeah, because I have key.

533
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,300
I want better stuff.

534
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,980
I have no attack... I want hammer point.

535
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,680
I think they're fighting at staging.

536
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,660
Yeah, they are.

537
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,560
Okay, okay, vault, vault, vault.

538
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:12,780
I can't open the key.

539
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,460
Vault, vault, vault.

540
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,940
Open the vault.

541
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,860
Open the vault.

542
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,240
Open the vault.

543
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,840
Open the vault.

544
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,320
Open.

545
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,900
Ooh.

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:21,760
Ooh.

547
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Wow, wow, wow.

548
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,960
What is this?

549
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,220
Wow, I got everything.

550
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:25,920
Wow.

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,160
Wow, wow.

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,740
Okay.

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,700
Barrel?

554
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,040
Wow.

555
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,440
Is this hammer point?

556
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,400
Oh, it's skull piercer.

557
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,720
Okay.

558
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,880
Let's go kill.

559
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,500
Oh.

560
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,620
Oh, wait, what?

561
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,220
Wait, wait, wait.

562
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,600
Behind, behind, behind.

563
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,540
Look, look, look.

564
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,300
Behind us.

565
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,640
Behind us.

566
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,900
Okay, okay, okay.

567
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,180
Okay, let's see.

568
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,420
Okay, I wish to fly.

569
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,840
I see...

570
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,640
They're like this way.

571
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,300
No, no, no, no.

572
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,220
Yeah.

573
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,480
So close, so close to us.

574
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,340
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,680
There's...

576
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,000
It's split.

577
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,500
Split up.

578
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,320
Oh, whoa.

579
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,140
Oh, oh.

580
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,400
Oh, my God.

581
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,940
Oh, careful.

594
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,260

Oh, my God.

605
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,300
I didn't see.

606
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,580
I didn't see.

607
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,200

No more listening.

633
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,740

Oh.

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,500
Because like his scans are better.

657
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,760
I don't remember his kit.

658
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,000
But like...

659
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,220
Okay.

660
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,800
What is this kit?

661
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,640
Oh, yeah.

662
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,380

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,060
Oh, Revenant is good too.

665

Revenant, Crypto is good too.

666
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,460
Sierra is good.

667
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,800
Everyone plays Sierra now.

668
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:00,900
Sierra is good.

669
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,020

670
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,540

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,180
My chat.

678
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,880
My chat was like, Sierra is not good.

679
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,520
I think Sierra is good.

680
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,280
The Earth is really weak.

681
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,180
His scan is better now.

682
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,320
Oh, really?

683
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,000

00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah.

685
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,680
Because like it's longer.

686
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,120

702
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,840
No team.

703
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,480
Nice.

704
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,060

I like how we're all...

717
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,860
Okay.

718
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,040

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,860
Is there anyone here?

729
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,240

741
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:32,940
Okay.

742
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,460

Oh.

751
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,050
I haven't found a single hammer point.

752
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,130
Is hammer point crafter?

753
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:55,470
No.

754
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,670

It's bats.

757
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,410
There's no more crafter.

758
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,550
I forgot.

759
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,070
Yeah.

760
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,190
It's pretty hard to find.

761
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,670
I haven't found a single hammer point.

762
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,030

763
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,750

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,160
Oh.

774
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,240
We should do...

775
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,720
Wait.

776
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,100

777
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,040

778
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,780

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:33,880
That's...

782
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,780
Never mind.

783
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,720
That's map consulate.

784
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,240

785
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,760
Where do we...

786
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:38,940

00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,620
Kill.

805
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,640
Kill who?

806
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,180
Who do we kill?

807
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,840
Kill enemy.

808
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,840

00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,580
MVP.

837
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,600
I'm not sure if they are finished.

838
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,480
I didn't hear anything.

839
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,660
I hear.

840
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:31,960
I hear.

841
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,020
Just do.

842
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,660

843
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,200
Oh.

844
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,380
Okay.

845
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:34,920
Oh.

846
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,680

848
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,660
Fabi.

849
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,780
Sorry, let me put it on right now.

850
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,580
Alright, headphones on.

851
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,840
Where?

852
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,440
No heartbeat.

853
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,740
Oh, big mod?

854
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,140
Okay.

855
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,800
They might have better armor.

856
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,420
Maybe.

857
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,800
I'm looking.

858
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,400
I have to get closer.

859
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:08,900
Maybe?

860
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,700
Her armor is pretty bad too.

861
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,200
I can't scan this.

862
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm too far.

863
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,840
Yes.

864
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,480
Let me shake.

865
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,520
No heartbeats?

866
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,400
No heartbeat?

867
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,220
No?

868
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,560
Ditto!

869
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
Liar!

870
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,960
Wait, what?

871
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,180
Oh, so far!

872
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,600
Ditto, you liar.

873
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,160
One guy cracked.

874
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,980
You liar.

875
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,020
Oh!

876
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm a liar!

877
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,340
You liar.

878
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,160
They rotate.

879
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,760
Yeah.

880
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,580
Rotate.

881
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,920
This is why Uto's idea.

882
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,340
Okay, Uto, Uto.

883
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,520
Orders, orders.

884
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,700
Wait, I think...

885
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,940
In ring, in ring.

886
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,780
Wait, wait, wait.

887
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,280
They're coming, they're coming.

888
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,460
Jump tower, jump tower.

889
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,480
Jump tower, yeah.

890
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
Oh, they flat.

891
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,480
Wait, wait, one...

892
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,200
Oh, they left, yeah.

893
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,140
Yeah, I will chase them.

894
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,120
Okay, I guess I'll jump tower.

895
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,480
I think they are...

896
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,380
Oh, I'm so far.

897
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,200
Where are they?

898
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm so far.

899
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,040
They're like... They flew over this way.

900
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,700
Ditto, what's wrong with your ears?

903
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,460
Why is your...

904
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,940
They're here.

905
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,360
They check me.

906
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,180
They're here.

907
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,860
I pinged them.

908
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,780
Okay.

909
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,080
They're to my left.

910
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,440
Okay, kill them.

911
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,460
Kill, kill.

912
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,040
Alright.

913
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,380
Left side.

914
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:54,880
They're...

915
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

916
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,080
They're here, yeah.

917
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,580
Okay, okay.

918
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,100
Yeah, they're coming to us.

919
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,480
Maybe?

920
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,760
Are they?

921
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
They get inside.

922
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,140
Inside?

923
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,940
Oh, so they'll be... They're here then.

924
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,360
Yeah.

925
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,000
They have... They have spear?

926
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,160
I don't know.

927
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,580
I don't know.

928
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,440
Do they?

929
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,360
I don't know.

930
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,060
Yeah.

931
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,220
Ditto, put your headphones on.

932
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
It's sign, it's sign, sign, sign.

933
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,200
Look here, look here.

934
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,580
No?

935
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,560
Ditto!

936
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,300
No, look, look, look.

937
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,840
No, no.

938
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,720
No heartbeat.

939
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,740
I heard something.

940
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,800
I heard something.

941
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,680
Where?

942
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
I heard something.

943
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,000
There's nothing.

944
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,260
No.

945
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,820
No.

946
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,300
Where?

947
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,120
Where?

948
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,180
No heartbeat.

949
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,020
I heard something.

950
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,400
No.

951
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,860
No.

952
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,140
No enemy.

953
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,980
No enemy.

954
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,200
No enemy.

955
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,500
The teleport!

956
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,160
The teleport!

957
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,360
They left, right?

958
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:52,900
They...

959
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,980
Close the door.

960
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,360
Close the door.

961
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,520
I think they went that.

962
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,420
I think they went...

963
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,760
Oh.

964
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,160
Maybe they're here.

965
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,120
The hole is inside.

966
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,760
The hole is inside.

967
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,880
This is why...

968
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,500
This is why...

969
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,680
This is why Uto's IGL.

970
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:07,800
Hahahaha.

971
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,280
IZF!

972
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,880
KURIN!

973
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,840
Okay...

974
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,380
KURIN...

975
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,920
Where, where, where?

976
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,580
The Toast, crazy.

977
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,120
The Toast...

978
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,600

What happened, Ditto?

1066
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,020
I'm smart.

1067
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,300
No.

1068
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,540
They shot me.

1069
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,040

I'm a genius.

1071
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,920
I was gonna die.

1072
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,120
Just don't die.

1073
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,440

1074
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,780
I'm still alive.

1075
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,500
I'm still alive.

1076
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,920
Okay, this is why Uto is the pro player and we are just pride.

1173
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,020
I get up.

1174
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,400
Yeah.

1175
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,000
I think he's...

1176
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,860
They ran around.

1177
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,200
Wow.

1178
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,280
I would never leave you guys like them.

1179
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,840
Where should we go?

1180
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,880
Where should we go now?

1181
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,360
I wanna see... find the knock guy.

1182
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,420
Oh here!

1183
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,460
Enemy!

1184
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:56,860
Go.

1185
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Go.

1186
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,180
Go.

1187
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,280
Go.

1188
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,440
Go.

1189
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,520
Go.

1190
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,920
Kill.

1191
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,280
Kill.

1192
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,480
Kill.

1193
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,180
Oh dead.

1194
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm dead.

1195
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,120
Nice.

1196
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,700
See?

1197
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,440
Nice.

1198
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,780
Good idea.

1199
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,940
Nice idea.

1200
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Okay.

1201
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,520
Nice idea.

1202
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,660
I... I...

1203
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,800
I will shut my mouth and I will leave.

1204
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,520
I will shut my mouth and I will leave.

1205
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,520
Enemy.

1206
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:20,940
New.

1207
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,280
Oh.

1208
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,900
Oh.

1209
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,660
Help me.

1210
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,620
Help me.

1211
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,800
We're coming over.

1212
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,120
We're coming.

1213
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,500
We're coming.

1214
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:26,760
We're coming.

1215
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,100
Oh wait.

1216
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:28,380
Four?

1217
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,560
Here.

1218
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,260
Here.

1219
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh my god.

1220
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,080
Oh my god.

1221
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh my god.

1222
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Wait.

1223
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,820
Red armor.

1224
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,780
Wait.

1225
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Red armor.

1226
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,220
My aim.

1227
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:48,580
That.

1228
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:48,980
That.

1229
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,440
My aim.

1230
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:49,700
My aim.

1231
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:49,880
That.

1232
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:49,880
That.

1233
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:49,880
My aim.

1234
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,620
Was pretty bad there.

1235
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,720
Inside.

1236
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,140
Inside.

1237
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,520
Behind?

1238
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,120
Oh my god.

1239
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,400
Okay.

1240
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:57,620
Okay.

1241
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,600
Oh yeah.

1242
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:58,820
Let's.

1243
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,100
Let's.

1244
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,120
Let's go for this.

1245
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,660
Oh wait.

1246
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:00,800
Wait.

1247
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:00,880
Wait.

1248
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,500
One team is me.

1249
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,140
One team is me.

1250
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,680
Fuck.

1251
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,120
No.

1252
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,600
No.

1253
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,520
One team is me.

1254
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:05,900
Oh shit.

1255
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,540
Nice.

1256
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:09,880
Nice.

1257
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,180
I'm going 2x.

1258
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,660
Can you call on me?

1259
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:12,920
Wait.

1260
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,440
That's Vigi.

1261
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,300
That's Vigi.

1262
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:16,860
Oh.

1263
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,650
We're so fucked.

1264
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,810
We're so fucked.

1265
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,350
I'm gonna.

1266
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,290
I'm going to.

1267
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:25,890
I'm going to.

1268
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,010
Wait.

1269
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,590
This is ring 4.

1270
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,450
Oh shit.

1271
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:28,910
Okay.

1272
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,530
This is scary.

1273
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,330
Wait.

1274
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,170
Give me a sec.

1275
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,130
Give me a sec.

1276
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,730
Okay.

1277
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,650
Maybe I can revive Uto.

1278
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,250
I think.

1279
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:39,290
Yeah.

1280
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:39,490
Yeah.

1281
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,290
Uto can you crawl to me?

1282
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,610
Uto can you crawl?

1283
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,350
Yeah.

1284
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:44,430
Yeah.

1285
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:44,830
Keep crawling.

1286
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,210
Keep crawling.

1287
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,790
And you can revive me here.

1288
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,210
Okay.

1289
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:48,870
Alright.

1290
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,050
Goodbye Uto.

1291
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,270
Goodbye.

1292
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:52,630
Goodbye.

1293
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,370
Wait.

1294
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,730
Are you okay, Tera?

1295
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,650
I'm okay.

1296
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,030
That one team there.

1297
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,650
But I think that's.

1298
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,090
It's fine.

1299
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:04,990
It's fine?

1300
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,650
Is it actually fine?

1301
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,010
You can revive me here.

1302
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,030
Okay.

1303
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:08,710
Yes.

1304
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,990
Be careful.

1305
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:11,370
Be careful.

1306
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,390
I swear to god.

1307
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,130
If you're not fine.

1308
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,530
I swear to god.

1309
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,270
I swear to god.

1310
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:16,290
I swear to god.

1311
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:16,930
Liar.

1312
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,870
I'm fine.

1313
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,490
I'm fine.

1314
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:19,890
I'm fine.

1315
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,250
Are you sure?

1316
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,090
You're.

1317
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:21,850
Okay.

1318
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,510
One team here.

1319
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:23,870
No.

1320
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,830
I'm not fine.

1321
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,270
Okay.

1322
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,970
Okay.

1323
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,390
Okay.

1324
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,850
Let's go.

1325
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,070
Let's go.

1326
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,550
Alright.

1327
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,790
I don't.

1328
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,790
I don't think I was fine.

1329
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,910
No.

1330
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,350
Why?

1331
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,270
Every time.

1332
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,270
I was not fine.

1333
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,150
I was.

1334
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,870
He has an army.

1335
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,230
Yeah.

1336
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,630
I'm playing Bangla.

1337
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,930
Okay.

1338
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,950
Okay.

1339
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,610
Nice.

1340
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,970
Nice.

1341
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:21,970
Nice.

1342
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:22,170
Nice.

1343
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,930
Nice call.

1344
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,230
Okay, this time.

1345
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,810
This time we'll get champion.

1346
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,210
Right here.

1347
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,390
I believe.

1348
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,190
I believe this time.

1349
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,350
It'll be different.

1350
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,190
There's no sound.

1351
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,190
I turned on my headphones but there's no sound behind me.

1352
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,850
Are you sure?

1353
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,830
Are you sure it did help?

1354
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,230
Yes.

1355
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,550
Yes.

1356
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:48,890
I'm sure.

1357
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,130
Is your headphones on correctly?

1358
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:52,810
Okay.

1359
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,310
Yeah.

1360
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,390
Wait.

1361
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,190
Did you turn Apex sound on?

1362
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,870
This is why we need to play for 12 hours.

1363
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,430
We always take two hours for warm up.

1364
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:09,730
Yeah.

1365
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,670
We need two hours to warm up.

1366
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,590
Okay.

1367
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,750
Let me turn off my VPN.

1368
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,550
I'm turning off my VPN.

1369
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:22,810
This time.

1370
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,110
NordVPN off.

1371
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,850
Not sponsored.

1372
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,080
Let's go.

1373
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,840
I'm not in the banner.

1374
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:37,980
Alright.

1375
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,300
Here we go.

1376
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,800
Okay.

1377
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,760
Why did it mute you guys?

1378
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,620
What?

1379
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,420
It muted you guys.

1380
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,400
Wow.

1381
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,260
Alright.

1382
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,080
Where are we landing?

1383
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,060
Countdown?

1384
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:02,940
No.

1385
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,180
Here.

1386
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,780
Countdown?

1387
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,440
Come on.

1388
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:04,880
Yeah.

1389
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,320
Here.

1390
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,380
Here.

1391
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,160
Yeah.

1392
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,540
Yeah.

1393
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:06,860
Yeah.

1394
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,060
Yeah.

1395
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,200
Yeah.

1396
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
We can do it.

1397
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,940
Look at us.

1398
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,540
Oh.

1399
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,740
Is this the place?

1400
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,160
Okay.

1401
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,940
Don't worry.

1402
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,780
We're prepped.

1403
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,200
No.

1404
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,160
They're on the way.

1405
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,840
They're on the way.

1406
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,620
No.

1407
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,060
Don't worry.

1408
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,420
There's no one of us.

1409
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,900
Don't worry.

1410
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,520
One team.

1411
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:18,980
One team.

1412
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,380
One team.

1413
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:19,580
Yeah.

1414
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,220
One team is just one team.

1415
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,360
We're so good.

1416
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,880
I have a Mozambique.

1417
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,620
I'm not good.

1418
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:27,980
One guy with me.

1419
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,360
One team is me.

1420
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm not.

1421
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,060
I have Mozambique.

1422
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,700
Mozambique.

1423
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,280
Okay.

1424
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,720
Okay.

1425
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,040
Mozambique.

1426
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,040
You can do it.

1427
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,700
You're prepped.

1428
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
You're prepped too.

1429
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,480
You're also prepped.

1430
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,320
You can.

1431
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,660
But Uto is pro.

1432
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,280
Come here.

1433
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,560
Come here.

1434
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,020
You're both Uto.

1435
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,240
Uto.

1436
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,560
Come here.

1437
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:47,900
Come here.

1438
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,100
Pro.

1439
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:48,500
Pro.

1440
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,100
We need pro.

1441
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,940
You say.

1442
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,140
You say.

1443
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,520
Okay.

1444
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:50,960
Okay.

1445
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,120
Two teams.

1446
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,520
Two teams.

1447
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:51,940
Okay.

1448
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,220
Okay.

1449
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,020
Only one team.

1450
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,660
One guy is there.

1451
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay.

1452
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,240
We're inside the next room.

1453
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,260
I see them.

1454
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,520
Oh my God.

1455
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,140
Holy shit.

1456
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,660
Alright.

1457
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,360
They can aim.

1458
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,020
They can aim.

1459
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,200
They're pro.

1460
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,060
They're pro too.

1461
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,820
They're pro too.

1462
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,440
They're pro too.

1463
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,640
I'm going to heal myself.

1464
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,460
I need to heal.

1465
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,260
No sound.

1466
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,280
No sound.

1467
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:16,760
No.

1468
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,600
He's streamered mode.

1469
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,320
He is pro.

1470
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,740
Dude.

1471
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,120
I'm gonna come to you.

1472
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,280
No sound.

1473
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:26,860
No sound.

1474
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860
No sound.

1475
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860
No sound.

1476
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:26,860
No sound.

1477
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,740
So at least we'll be together.

1478
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,000
Wait, two teams?

1479
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,300
Two teams?

1480
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,320
Yeah, two teams.

1481
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,820
On me?

1482
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,460
Actually?

1483
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,940
Wait, what?

1484
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,180
What the fuck?

1485
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,680
Wait!

1486
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,180
What?

1487
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,980
I thought it was...

1488
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,500
What?

1489
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
New team, new team.

1490
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,960
Another new team!

1491
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,760
Another new team, yeah.

1492
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,120
Another new team!

1493
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,140
Wait, they are bread!

1494
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,060
I knew it.

1495
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,220
I fucking knew it.

1496
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
New team.

1497
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,980
Okay, okay.

1498
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:02,860
Okay.

1499
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,080
We were... look.

1500
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:06,940
Look.

1501
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,120
That game we were trolling.

1502
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,320
We were trolling.

1503
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,060
Look, only Preds can kill Preds, okay?

1504
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,460
Okay, okay.

1505
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,660
They're Pred, so they killed us too.

1506
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,760
If it was not Pred players, you know, they're higher Pred ranked.

1507
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,240
than us.

1508
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,660
Yes, yes.

1509
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,500
Okay, okay.

1510
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,300
And they are poor because they killed Utho.

1511
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1512
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,340
They had two Pros.

1513
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,500
They had two Pros.

1514
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,240
We only have one.

1515
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,040
Guys, we only have one.

1516
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,520
Only have one.

1517
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,060
We only have one Pro.

1518
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,340
It's not fair.

1519
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,280
They had two Pros.

1520
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,220
Do you wanna be a PoI?

1521
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,660
No.

1522
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,780
I want to have a life.

1523
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,720
I want...

1524
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,740
Alright.

1525
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,140
Conduit can use Q like two times.

1526
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,280
Oh, true, true.

1527
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,020
True!

1528
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:13,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1529
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,580
It's pretty strong, I think.

1530
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,280
We'll be so strong.

1531
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,640
Yeah.

1532
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,840
True.

1533
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,600
We can't die.

1534
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,700
Okay.

1535
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,520
If we die, it's Utho's fault.

1536
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,080
Oh!

1537
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,140
Oh!

1538
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,600
Oh my god, they have a roller player.

1539
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,020
They have two roller players.

1540
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,580
It's over.

1541
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,140
I think everyone in this is over.

1542
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,260
Why did you get the silver?

1543
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,460
We could have been in bronze!

1544
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:43,960
No!

1545
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,360
No!

1546
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,300
My game crashed!

1547
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,720
Game crashed!

1548
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,340
No!

1549
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,940
Don't drop yet!

1550
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,420
No!

1551
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,240
Where's my steam?

1552
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,360
No, we are learning!

1553
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,360
No!

1554
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,080
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

1555
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,200
Let's go somewhere else.

1556
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,580
Okay, okay.

1557
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
I'm coming back.

1558
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,560
Epic Center.

1559
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,420
Don't worry.

1560
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,060
I'm loading in.

1561
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,800
It's okay.

1562
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,520
You guys can watch V3.

1563
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,500
I believe you.

1564
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,840
Just don't land on another pred.

1565
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,000
Just don't...

1566
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,620
Don't land on a protein!

1567
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:23,960
Don't land on a protein!

1568
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,200
Yourself.

1569
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,640
The protein behind... near us.

1570
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,640
Wait, what?

1571
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,340
I said don't!

1572
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,380
I said don't!

1573
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,380
I said don't land on a protein!

1574
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,620
I said don't land on a protein!

1575
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,400
Okay, okay.

1576
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:38,680
I'm here.

1577
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:38,820
I'm here.

1578
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:39,980
I'm okay.

1579
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,640
Okay, nice, nice!

1580
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,540
Nice!

1581
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,560
I'm okay now.

1582
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,840
Okay, Where is team?

1583
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,100
Where's enemy?

1584
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:51,900
Okay.

1585
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,060
Enemy can go kill them.

1586
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,380
Yeah, we'll be fine.

1587
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,560
Okay, I'm heading over.

1588
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,540
I have loot.

1589
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,600
I'll head over to Ditto.

1590
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,180
Okay.

1591
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,020
Oh!

1592
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,780
There's two.

1593
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,380
There's two.

1594
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,020
Is it one team or two?

1595
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,360
Only one team.

1596
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,700
I have 30-30.

1597
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,620
I can poke.

1598
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:23,840
Nice.

1599
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,600
I'm looking.

1600
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,160
Okay.

1601
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,620
I'm charging my ult.

1602
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,820
I don't see them.

1603
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,440
Okay.

1604
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,260
It's looted on the right side.

1605
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,480
There's loot here too.

1606
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,480
I don't see them.

1607
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,240
Oh, digi, digi.

1608
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,300
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see.

1609
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,220
Here.

1610
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,340
Oh, digi.

1611
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,380
I don't have...

1612
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:50,420
Push?

1613
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:52,880
Push.

1614
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,380
Okay, okay.

1615
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,180
Uta says push.

1616
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,100
Oh, yeah, they're here.

1617
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,880
I see them.

1618
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,340
They're on the right.

1619
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,640
Okay, okay.

1620
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,860
I mean, we can...

1621
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,100
We can take this.

1622
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,520
Yes, take the zip line.

1623
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1624
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,780
You might hear it though.

1625
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,320
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

1626
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:11,940
He's separating.

1627
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,060
His teammates are to the right.

1628
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,520
Okay.

1629
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,700
I'm going to ditto.

1630
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,200
I'm going to ditto.

1631
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,850
I see one of them.

1632
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,730
I don't know where he is.

1633
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,550
Inside, inside, inside.

1634
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,410
One or two?

1635
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,990
Only one.

1636
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:29,910
Here?

1637
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,570
Only one.

1638
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:32,450
Where?

1639
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:32,950
On me?

1640
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:33,870
I hear him.

1641
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,210
Up, up, up.

1642
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,030
Up two, up two.

1643
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:36,750
Two?

1644
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,010
Okay.

1645
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,570
Okay, okay.

1646
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1647
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:40,890
Three, three.

1648
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:41,430
Three?

1649
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:41,830
All three.

1650
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,050
Okay.

1651
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:43,670
All three?

1652
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:43,890
Okay.

1653
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,150
Then they'll know we're here.

1654
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,810
They know.

1655
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:50,450
Wait.

1656
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:50,870
Wait.

1657
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,390
Are they shooting you?

1658
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,710
Are they shooting you?

1659
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,510
Yeah, okay.

1660
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,450
I don't know if we could get to...

1661
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,690
I don't know if we can climb up.

1662
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,830
I don't know if that's smart.

1663
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:01,710
Yeah.

1664
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,190
I don't think...

1665
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:02,410
Oh!

1666
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,730
Goodbye, Uto.

1667
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:08,650
Okay.

1668
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,410
On me, on me?

1669
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:11,930
On me, on me, on me?

1670
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,630
On.

1671
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,600
Oh, shit!

1672
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:17,840
No!

1673
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,360
Fall!

1674
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:21,740
No!

1675
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,100
Goodbye, Tito.

1676
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,120
Oh my god!

1677
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,900
On me!

1678
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,460
Dang it!

1679
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,100
Fall!

1680
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,280
That was like...

1681
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,440
Okay, wait.

1682
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,060
I got it.

1683
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:32,900
I got it.

1684
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,060
Guys, no.

1685
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,560
I figured it out.

1686
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,240
I should be playing Mad Maggie.

1687
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,040
No, I...

1688
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,700
I know now.

1689
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,700
Now we win.

1690
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,880
Now we win.

1691
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,400
What is... What is Mad Maggie's kid?

1692
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,280
I don't even know.

1693
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,440
Now, this time.

1694
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,160
This time.

1695
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,460
This time.

1696
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,800
We were just trying to find the best team comp.

1697
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,680
You know?

1698
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,840
We don't know what the best team comp is.

1699
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,600
Alright, what is...

1700
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,020
Okay.

1701
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,480
What is the best team comp?

1702
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,000
Mad Maggie.

1703
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,020
Really?

1704
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,420
No, I don't know.

1705
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,000
No!

1706
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Her pose is good, I think.

1707
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,480
I think her ball is really good though.

1708
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,420
Yeah.

1709
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
This is it.

1710
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,100
This is it.

1711
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,520
This time.

1712
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:33,740
Okay.

1713
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,840
I believe.

1714
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,600
Good luck!

1715
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,830
Okay.

1716
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,130
What is my thing?

1717
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,550
True.

1718
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,350
The extra drill charge.

1719
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,890
Ooh, big drill!

1720
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,070
Holy shit!

1721
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,050
That's insane.

1722
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,230
We're just downloading right now.

1723
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,110
Downloading meta.

00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,670
We're like AI.

1726
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,450
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

We're AI learning right now.

1728
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:14,370
We're AI.

1729
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,470
Yeah, chat GPT.

1730
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,650
Every game we get stronger.

1731
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:27,290
We're like AI.

1732
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:27,750
Is there a team here?

1733
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:28,130
Nice.

1734
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,330
Yeah, one team here.

1735
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,130
Where?

1736
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,050
With you.

1737
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,330
Oh, shit!

1738
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,190
Yeah!

1739
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,490
Yeah, with me, with me by the way.

1740
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,210
Let me...

1741
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,070
Okay, are you okay?

1742
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,370
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1743
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,110
He's like in here.

1744
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,070
One team here.

1745
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,230
Two?

1746
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,210
Is this two teams?

1747
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:51,730
Maybe this...

1748
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,470
Are they...

1749
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:53,450
The same team.

1750
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,150
They're the same team.

1751
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,550
There's teaming countdown too.

1752
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,830
Where are they?

1753
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:28,230
Inside?

1754
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,290
Yeah, inside.

1755
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:30,350
GB!

1756
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,430
Kill him!

1757
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,470
Ok, ok.

1758
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,190
I'm over.

1759
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,130
One crack.

1760
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:40,050
GB!

1761
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,010
High ground?

1762
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:42,490
Yeah, high ground.

1763
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:43,190
Don't fall.

1764
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:51,870
On me?

1765
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,570
What the fuck?

1766
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,970
What?

1767
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:58,790
I got beamed so fast!

1768
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,670
What the fuck?

1769
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,370
It's ok.

1770
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,230
I beamed them too.

1771
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,370
What?

1772
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,610
Holy shit!

1773
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,530
That was so fast!

1774
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,750
I forgot what it was like to have zero armor.

1775
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,310
Oh no, they're resing.

1776
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,250
Ok, whoever that guy that killed me...

1777
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,690
Fuck that guy.

1778
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:25,270
I'm gonna go.

1779
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:25,990
Careful, careful.

1780
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,950
You guys can back up, I feel like.

1781
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,470
Maybe just res me over the farther side.

1782
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:33,690
Yeah, that's just smart.

1783
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:36,170
Oh my god!

1784
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,770
Bro, fuck that one guy.

1785
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:42,070
Bro, fuck that one guy.

1786
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,190
Literally looked at him and I died.

1787
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:44,530
Literally looked at him and I died.

1788
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:44,930
Forgot.

1789
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,470
Ok, ok.

1790
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,570
And they're gonna come to us and we fight and we win.

1791
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,230
And they're gonna come to us and we fight and we win.

1792
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,190
Come here.

1793
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:01,690
Careful, Uto.

1794
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:03,270
Ok.

1795
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:06,230
Oh no, she don't have to be careful.

1796
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:06,730
She's poor.

1797
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,030
Oh yeah, you're right.

1798
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,190
You don't have to be careful.

1799
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,090
You'll be fine.

1800
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,070
Ok, fuck that!

1801
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,270
Ok, oh shit.

1802
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,410
One crack, one crack, one crack.

1803
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:17,510
One crack?

1804
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:18,410
Ok, I'm coming over.

1805
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,810
I need to... I'm gonna get high ground.

1806
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:22,870
Cause I'm scared now.

1807
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,130
Are they?

1808
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,830
Um...

1809
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,870
You know?

1810
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,010
Middle, middle, middle.

1811
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:29,690
Oh, middle.

1812
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,230
Oh my god.

1813
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:32,170
Fuck that guy.

1814
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,910
I don't have...

1815
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,750
Long range.

1816
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,270
Me too.

1817
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,410
I will go get our army.

1818
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,850
Yeah, in front of me.

1819
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,410
I'm gonna go get Ditto.

1820
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,050
We won't be together.

1821
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,950
No, I can't.

1822
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,590
After that guy, I'm just scared now.

1823
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:55,210
I don't have...

1824
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:56,050
A backpack.

1825
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,330
You still don't... Wait, me too.

1826
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,490
I still don't have a backpack.

1827
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,470
Wait, there's a blue armor here.

1828
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,850
Not blue, a blue helmet.

1829
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:06,830
I need a two-cells.

1830
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,270
There's no armor.

1831
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,730
Where are they?

1832
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:12,530
Are they still there?

1833
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,990
I don't know.

1834
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,370
I'm scared now.

1835
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:15,810
No, I don't see one.

1836
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:16,470
I don't see one.

1837
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,830
Maybe they low-chained.

1838
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,190
Yeah, that one guy gave me PTSD.

1839
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,550
Oh my god, he beamed you.

1840
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,130
Yeah.

1841
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:26,410
I'm gonna give you two.

1842
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,710
I lived for one second.

1843
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,450
Wait a minute.

1844
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,330
Two battle here.

1845
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:33,570
Ooh.

1846
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,030
Nice, nice, nice.

1847
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,710
I think they...

1848
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:39,630
They run?

1849
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,470
We're already in ring.

1850
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,370
Why do they need to go in ring when we're already in ring?

1851
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:49,230
Why do they need to go in ring when we're already in ring?

1852
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:49,870
Oh, you're right.

1853
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:51,950
You're right.

1854
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:52,030
You're right.

1855
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,110
Let's go, Pizu.

1856
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:56,290
Ooh.

1857
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,310
I thought this was the other one.

1858
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,150
Okay.

1859
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,090
How did I still not...

1860
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:04,830
How did I still not found a backpack?

1861
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,250
I have zero shield cells.

1862
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:10,730
Zero?

1863
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,710
Okay.

1864
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:12,670
Here, I'll sell.

1865
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:13,650
Oh, nice.

1866
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:15,130
Ooh.

1867
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:17,310
Yummy.

1868
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,710
Oh, it can...

1869
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,310
It can fly to the core.

1870
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,170
Wait.

1871
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:22,290
Wait.

1872
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:23,570
They scanned.

1873
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,630
Yo, they're still there.

1874
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,230
Revenge.

1875
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,970
Um, okay.

1876
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,790
You guys kill that one guy that killed me.

1877
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:36,410
And then I'll...

1878
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,190
And then I'll be fine.

1879
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:41,950
I need that.

1880
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:43,870
I need that.

1881
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:44,250
Oh.

1882
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,850
Where are they?

1883
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,870
Still on the building.

1884
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:51,830
Are they hiding?

1885
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,010
Are they hiding?

1886
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,590
Yeah.

1887
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,690
This is I play.

1888
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,490
There's a lot of team hiding.

1889
00:53:58,910 --> 00:53:59,510
Really?

1890
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:01,670
Cowards.

1891
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,700
Cowards.

1892
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,040
Oh, they went there.

1893
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,560
They went there.

1894
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,240
Oh, okay.

1895
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:10,700
They're fine.

1896
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,080
That's fine.

1897
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,180
Um...

1898
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,660
Um...

1899
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,380
Um...

1900
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,600
Um...

1901
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,820
I don't have shield cells.

1902
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,040
Do you need valet?

1903
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,600
No, I just need shield cells.

1904
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,500
I only have two.

1905
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:28,940
Okay.

1906
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:29,780
Okay.

1907
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,180
Okay.

1908
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,680
I can give you tea here.

1909
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,480
I'm gonna check if there's any extra here.

1910
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,360
Thank you.

1911
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:35,360
Thank you.

1912
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:36,720
It's okay.

1913
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,980
I will probably take it.

1914
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:40,920
Alright.

1915
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,180
There's a three... Does anyone want 3x?

1916
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,180
Crypto drone?

1917
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:43,940
Crypto drone?

1918
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,160
Crypto?

1919
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:45,580
Oh, here.

1920
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:45,840
Here.

1921
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:45,980
Here.

1922
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,160
Here.

1923
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,580
Oh, shit.

1924
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,020
Over here?

1925
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,020
Where?

1926
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,480
Where?

1927
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:49,980
Where?

1928
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,420
I will go get here.

1929
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,160
I will go to this building.

1930
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:54,780
Over.

1931
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,560
Where I'm looking at.

1932
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,160
Jesus Christ.

1933
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,340
He's cracked.

1934
00:54:59,420 --> 00:54:59,740
He's cracked.

1935
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,180
Okay.

1936
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:00,600
I have to heal.

1937
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:01,620
Okay.

00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:27,560
Two teams.

1967
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:27,900
Two teams.

1968
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,380
Careful.

1969
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:28,660
Two teams.

1970
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:28,980

00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,180
Yeah.

1986
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,980
Go high ground.

1987
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,420
Go high ground.

1988
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:48,920
Okay.

1989
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,260
Uh.

1990
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,240
Careful.

1991
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,160
Behind us.

1992
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,440
Okay.

1993
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:54,920
Um.

1994
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,460
I will go fourth floor.

1995
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,060
Hey, guys.

1996
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,580
Pretty...

1997
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,200
Yeah.

1998
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,780
Pretty scary.

1999
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:00,900
Okay.

2000
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,800
Let's switch teams.

2001
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,700
Scary.

2002
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,800
I might die.

2003
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:10,860
I might do something stupid.

2004
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,520
Finally, I get blue.

2005
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,680
That's fine.

2006
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,460
I...

2007
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,960
I... I wanna... I wanna fight the team behind us.

2008
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:23,460
Uh.

2009
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,300
They're like all the way.

2010
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,340
I think we should get crack first.

2011
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,380
Cause they're...

2012
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:29,680

2013
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:29,880
Yeah.

2014
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,060
Yeah.

2015
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,420
This team is so annoying though.

2016
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,220
I'm burning one.

2017
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:35,540
Yeah.

2018
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,840
But you guys have shield cells?

2019
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,680
Um.

Okay.

2025
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,900

00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,300
You're so poor.

2028
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,600
That... That team is still white.

2029
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,540
White armor.

2030
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,780
Leave us alone.

2031
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,440
I don't wanna waste my heals.

2032
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,800
Okay.

2033
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,480
I'll use my battery all...

2034
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,460
Leave us alone.

2035
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,440
Oh my god.

2036
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,640

00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,420
Okay.

2049
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,260
I'm batting.

2050
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,100
It's fine.

2051
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,080

00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,420
There's so many new teams.

00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,300
Oh my god.

2135
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,000
There's people here.

2136
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:32,540
There's people here.

2137
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,220
There's people here.

2138
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,680
There's a ref here.

2139
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,680
Oh my god.

2140
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,000
Leave.

2141
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:40,720
Oh my god.

2142
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,120
I'm Phoenix Kitting.

2143
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,620
I'm Phoenix Kitting.

2144
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:46,700
No.

2145
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:46,840
No.

2146
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:46,980
No.

2147
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,080
No.

2148
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,380
No.

2149
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:48,860
Careful.

2150
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:49,780
Careful.

2151
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,140
I'm helping.

2152
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:50,460
I'm helping.

2153
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,000
I'm helping.

2154
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,220
Careful.

2155
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:51,520
Careful.

2156
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,640
Use your shield.

2157
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:55,900
I'm...

2158
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,020
Oh.

2159
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:57,640
That... Fuck.

2160
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:58,400
Okay.

2161
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,040
I have to... I have to bat.

2162
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,480
I have to bat.

2163
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,260
Nice one.

2164
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,360
Nice one.

2165
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,460
No.

2166
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,680
What?

2167
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,480
Ayo is aiming.

2168
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,520
Look.

2169
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,900
We had nothing.

2170
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,200
We had nothing.

2171
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,660
We were so poor.

2172
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,440
Yeah.

2173
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,400
We were so poor.

2174
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,940
What the fuck.

2175
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,160
We couldn't loot.

2176
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,300
We couldn't loot.

2177
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:32,740
Leave us alone.

2178
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,060
Leave us alone.

2179
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:35,060
Okay.

2180
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,660
They didn't let us loot.

2181
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:37,360
Yeah.

2182
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,180
I had zero shields.

2183
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,220
What do I do?

2184
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,020
I just... I just wanted...

2185
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,420
I just wanted heals.

2186
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,880
We were so poor.

2187
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,380
It was so sad.

2188
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,670
Oh my god.

2189
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:00,050
Oh my god.

2190
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,110
No one...

2191
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:04,770
No one wanted us to get anything.

2192
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,690
That's so fucked up.

2193
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,490
There were three teams in Skyhook.

2194
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,030
And...

2195
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,010
There was five teams.

2196
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,630
More teams kept coming.

2197
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,270
We couldn't go anywhere.

2198
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,170
We couldn't go anywhere.

2199
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,810
Oh my god.

2200
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:26,470
That one building had like three teams that ran in.

2201
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:27,710
That one building had like three teams that ran in.

2202
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:30,890
That was crazy.

2203
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:32,770
Yeah.

2204
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,230
We are in the middle of...

2205
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,850
Of the lane.

2206
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:36,170
No.

2207
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:36,410
No.

2208
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,150
Of the team.

2209
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:37,750
Yeah.

2210
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:39,350
Like in the middle.

2211
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:43,770
Oh my god.

2212
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:44,670
That was like crazy.

2213
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,210
Oh my god.

2214
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,030
That was like crazy.

2215
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:46,070
Alright.

2216
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,750
I'm muted but I want to say for those who are like hide your map.

2217
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:49,470
Alright.

2218
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:50,870
If you...

2219
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,770
If you cannot fucking see...

2220
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,610
If you need a map to know where I am...

2221
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,670
There's no way you can kill me.

2222
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:58,410
Okay.

2223
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,250
I got it.

2224
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,130
You're not at skill level to kill me.

2225
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,330
If you need a map to know where I am.

2226
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,350
It's not that good.

2227
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,990
Okay.

2228
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:05,590
We're good.

2229
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:13,410
Brawler.

2230
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:16,450
I have an alternating.

2231
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:20,610
Okay.

2232
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,130
I have alternating massive.

2233
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,130
I have a rampage.

2234
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,390
And a two-way.

2235
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:28,750
Wait.

2236
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:29,430
Do we have team here?

2237
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:29,950
No, right?

2238
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:31,170
No.

2239
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,670
We're the countdown team.

2240
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:37,930
We are...

2241
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:39,950
We are the countdown team.

2242
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:40,670
Yeah.

2243
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,870
There's a lot of team in Skyhook.

2244
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:43,790
Alright.

2245
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:44,210
Let's do it.

2246
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:45,390
We're the third party.

2247
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:47,110
Okay.

2248
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:51,410
We can do it.

2249
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:56,760
Whoa.

2250
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,160
Okay.

2251
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,080
That was a weird lag.

2252
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,820
Are you lagging?

2253
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,100
No.

2254
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:03,420
I'm good.

2255
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,640
I was lagging a little earlier.

2256
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:04,880
Yeah.

2257
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,560
Alright.

2258
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,220
I'm good.

2259
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:07,760
Let's go.

2260
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,180
If you find hammer point, let me know.

2261
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:10,620
Okay.

2262
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,460
What are you using?

2263
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,280
RE Hemlock.

2264
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:14,500
Okay.

2265
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,160
I'll grab some ammo.

2266
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:18,900
Yeah.

2267
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:20,680
Nice.

2268
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:22,520
Are you guys ready?

2269
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:25,840
I'm ready.

2270
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,060
I'm ready.

2271
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:27,840
Let's go.

2272
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,740
Let's see.

2273
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:30,700
Let's go.

2274
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:34,760
Let's go.

2275
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,620
Hello.

2276
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,540
Oh, I hear...

2277
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,000
They're fighting.

2278
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:39,740
Go.

2279
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:40,860
Go.

2280
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:40,980
Go.

2281
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:41,400
Are you here?

2282
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:41,840
I think.

2283
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:44,820
They're a lot closer.

2284
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,060
Yeah.

2285
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:46,220
Yeah.

2286
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,180
No knocks?

2287
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:47,420
Yeah.

2288
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,360
Right in front of me.

2289
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,000
Another team shooting?

2290
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,040
Three teams.

2291
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,220
In this building too.

2292
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,220
In this building?

2293
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:57,920
Yeah.

2294
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,680
Three teams?

2295
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:02,400
Wait.

2296
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,520
Someone near you, Utho.

2297
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,400
Yeah.

2298
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:04,720
Yeah.

2299
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:06,840
On Utho.

2300
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,020
Come to me.

2301
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,300
Come to me.

2302
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:09,820
Come to me.

2303
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:10,660
Come to me.

2304
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,180
I ulted.

2305
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:11,560
I ulted.

2306
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,040
On you.

2307
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:13,280
On you.

2308
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,680
Oh, we have to help Utho.

2309
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,060
Help Utho.

2310
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,480
I'm going.

2311
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,740
I got one.

2312
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:22,560
I got one.

2313
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:22,740
I got one.

2314
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,040
I got one.

2315
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,600
Oh my god.

2316
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,140
He's low.

2317
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,120
Where?

2318
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,200
Where?

2319
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:26,340
Where?

2320
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,140
Where?

2321
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:28,400
Where?

2322
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:28,540
Where?

2323
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:29,500
Above.

2324
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:29,820
Above.

2325
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,120
Okay.

2326
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,100
What the fuck?

2327
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,120
Oh.

2328
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,140
I'm dead.

2329
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:42,570
Ah, fuck.

2330
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:42,870
Okay.

2331
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,350
One guy here.

2332
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,290
On the stairs.

2333
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:47,150
Dreadfall.

2334
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:48,550
Two guys.

2335
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:48,910
Two guys.

2336
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:49,250
Two guys.

2337
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:49,710
I know.

2338
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:49,990
I know.

2339
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:51,710
I can't.

2340
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:52,990
I'm really low.

2341
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:56,130
You can go back to countdown and carve us.

2342
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,850
Oh yeah.

2343
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:57,170
Maybe.

2344
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,350
If they don't push me.

2345
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:58,630
Kill me.

2346
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:59,210
Kill me.

2347
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:04,370
Okay.

2348
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:05,490
Okay.

2349
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:06,330
Okay.

2350
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,030
They might chase me though.

2351
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:10,490
So.

2352
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,130
Oh my god.

2353
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:13,090
That's our star.

2354
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:14,910
Yeah.

2355
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:15,930
You guys died so fast.

2356
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:16,850
What the fuck happened?

2357
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:17,450
Yeah.

2358
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,550
Like I got one creep.

2359
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:20,970
I only have 9-9.

2360
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:24,310
I made a perfect aim with my 9-9.

2361
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:25,210
But I still lose.

2362
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:25,450
Oh.

2363
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,490
Cause you're on R9.

2364
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:28,990
That's why.

2365
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,230
You forgot.

2366
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,350
R9 is useless.

2367
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,150
I don't have...

2368
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,690
I don't have another camera than R9.

2369
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,810
Is alternator better than R9?

2370
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:40,330
R-E?

2371
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:42,630
Alternator.

2372
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:43,450
Alternator?

2373
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,190
I mean.

2374
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,150
I don't know.

2375
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:46,050
I just know...

2376
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:51,230
R9 is so dog shit now.

2377
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:52,570
Yes.

2378
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:52,990
Yes.

2379
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:53,330
Yes.

2380
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:54,210
That's all I know.

2381
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:54,910
Alright chat.

2382
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,210
Okay.

2383
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:57,570
Apex players and chat.

2384
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:59,730
Which one is better?

2385
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,650
Alternator or...

2386
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,390
Alternator or...

2387
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,930
I think like alternator gives more damage.

2388
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:05,790
I feel like.

2389
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:06,450
Yeah.

2390
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,570
I feel like that.

2391
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:08,910
Yeah.

2392
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,610
Especially if you have...

2393
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,210
Oh.

2394
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:13,690
They come.

2395
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,050
They come.

2396
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:14,590
They're coming.

2397
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:14,910
Where?

2398
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:15,630

2399
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,150

2400
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:16,770
Yeah.

2401
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,330
I see them.

2402
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:19,990
On the bridge too.

2403
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:21,810
80?

2404
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,630
I'm trying to help you guys.

2405
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:25,690
Okay.

2406
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:26,210
I'm up.

2407
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,490
Hello.

2408
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,070
I see them.

2409
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:29,570
They're to my left.

2410
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,610
I cracked the Waxxon.

2411
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,570
The Waxxon is running.

2412
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,270
To your left here.

2413
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:36,710
But the Waxxon is here.

2414
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,010
So it's one.

2415
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,750
Waxxon is far from team.

2416
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:41,710
But careful of...

2417
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:42,310
Careful.

2418
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,150
I'm coming up.

2419
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:45,090
Almost cracked.

2420
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,630
Almost cracked.

2421
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:50,230
Cracked.

2422
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:51,990
Two here.

2423
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:52,770
Okay.

2424
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,670
I might run.

2425
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:55,590
I might run.

2426
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:56,650
Yeah.

2427
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:57,450
I'm gonna run.

2428
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:57,870
Uto.

2429
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:00,010
I was like.

2430
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:00,670
No!

2431
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,130
See you.

2432
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,110
Oh my god.

2433
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:08,050
What the f***?

2434
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,170
That's so fast.

2435
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:11,850
That's so fast.

2436
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:12,530
Oh what the heck.

2437
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:16,330
I think my ear.

2438
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:17,090
My ear stayed.

2439
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,010
What happened?

2440
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,870
I didn't hear anything.

2441
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:23,650
Dero.

2442
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:24,290
Dero.

2443
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:25,310
You can like sometimes.

2444
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,470
You hear the.

2445
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,950
You hear like the smallest things.

2446
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,490
Or you hear nothing.

2447
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:32,450
Yeah.

2448
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:34,910
What the heck.

2449
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,110
Like.

2450
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,290
There are two.

2451
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,450
Two people on my left.

2452
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,290
But I couldn't hear anything.

2453
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,590
When I realize it.

2454
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:49,590
I think you're getting old.

2455
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,250
You're getting old.

2456
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:52,530
No.

2457
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,670
I was just 17.

2458
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,230
You're cute.

2459
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:55,850
No.

2460
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:56,690
You're getting old.

2461
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:57,590
Okay.

2462
01:07:58,830 --> 01:07:59,970
It's time.

2463
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,930
It's time for me to.

2464
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:02,630
Okay.

Okay.

2466
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:06,250
I will use my ear this time.

2467
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,510
You.

2468
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:08,430

2470
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:10,970
I turned on my headphone.

2471
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:11,790
Oh yeah.

2472
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,670

2476
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:15,450
This time.

2477
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:20,290
This time it will be different.

2478
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,810
We swear.

2479
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:23,190
Yeah.

2480
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:28,030
Don't worry.

2481
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:30,190
Don't worry.

2482
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,680
Can't do it.

2483
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,320
Can't do it.

2484
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,220
Can't do it.

2485
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,220
Is like.

2486
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,600
Can't do it.

2487
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,260
Can't do it.

2488
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,040
Can't do it.

2489
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,900
How many excuses are we gonna have?

2490
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,260
We're too heavy for Uto.

2491
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:51,920
Tero.

2492
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,680

01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,440
What the fuck, Tero?

2521
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,180
That was my house.

2522
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:39,340
No.

2523
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,140
This is mine.

2524
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,100
What the fuck?

2525
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,120
This is why we're too heavy for her.

2526
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,220
I like boys.

2527
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,220
This is why we're too heavy.

2528
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,340
I like boys.

2529
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:51,600
Okay.

2530
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:52,680
Let's see.

2531
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,100
Okay.

2532
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,440
I got 199 again.

2533
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,280
Get rid of that.

2534
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,100
Maybe car would be better.

2535
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:00,880
Okay.

2536
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,100
I can't say that.

2537
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,880
But I won...

2538
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:06,600
Pally.

2539
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:07,800
Pally?

2540
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:08,920
I found a lot of cars.

2541
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,500
I haven't found a single hammer point.

2542
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:13,980
Look.

2543
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,400
Where the fuck are the hammer points?

2544
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,080
There is hammer points.

2545
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,140
But it's pretty...

2546
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,720
Not now.

2547
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,880
But I have ever seen hammer points.

2548
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:23,300
Yeah.

2549
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,480
Hammer point is...

2550
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,360
I haven't found one hammer point yet.

2551
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:27,700
Hammer lock.

2552
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:28,540
Nice.

2553
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:29,660
Nice.

2554
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,540
I'm gonna go open this bin.

2555
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:34,800
Open this bin.

2556
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,360
Okay.

2557
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,240
If I don't...

2558
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,080
If I don't find power, I will give you guys...

2559
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,400
I'm gonna say I can find power too.

2560
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,280
PK here.

2561
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,020
You know, our first game was our best game.

2562
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,180
What happened to us?

2563
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,120
Our first game, we killed so many people.

2564
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:57,820
Our first game, we killed so many people.

2565
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,700
What happened to us?

2566
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,060
Yeah.

2567
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:00,920
What happened to us?

2568
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:05,080
Maybe...

2569
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:05,640
Maybe...

2570
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,880
Maybe we have to...

2571
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,140
Maybe we have to...

2572
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:10,620
Turn on hacks?

2573
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,580
Turn on hacks?

2574
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,220
Don't worry.

2575
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:14,960
While hacks on?

2576
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,140
Don't worry, guys.

2577
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,100
This time...

2578
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,580
Oh, I forgot to turn it on.

2579
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,280
Now I remember.

2580
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,100
Okay.

2581
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,440
I have so many cells now.

2582
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,700
I see there's people here.

2583
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,200
Okay, use power.

2584
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,320
Okay, I got power.

2585
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,520
Nice.

2586
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,440
Oh, there's people landed here.

2587
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,420
Okay.

2588
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,100
Here.

2589
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,120
Wait, there's two teams.

2590
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,000
We can third party.

2591
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,180
Okay.

2592
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:49,480
Okay.

2593
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,600
Are you gonna get up?

2594
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:52,840
I'm gonna...

2595
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,740
Whoa.

2596
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,540
That scared me.

2597
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,520
I'm gonna...

2598
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,040
They're fighting.

2599
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm hiding over.

2600
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,060
Okay.

2601
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,280
I see them.

2602
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:06,820
Are you fighting?

2603
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,900
I think they got knocks.

2604
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,220
Did they finish already?

2605
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,520
No.

2606
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,560
Not yet?

2607
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,200
No, no, no.

2608
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:17,980
Still fighting.

2609
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:18,380
Still fighting.

2610
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,120
Go.

2611
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:20,660
Okay.

2612
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,700
I'm so fast.

2613
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,120
You're so fast.

2614
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,460
I'm so fast.

2615
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:25,960
I'm slowly.

2616
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:33,920
Low, low, low, low.

2617
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,400
Okay.

2618
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:37,920
I'm going up.

2619
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,280
I used my ult.

2620
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,600
I'm going up.

2621
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,040
Mommy?

2622
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,720
I knocked myself.

2623
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,180
What?

2624
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:51,340
What?

2625
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,620
It is your ult.

2626
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,040
Oh my god.

2627
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,780
You ult me.

2628
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,300
I knocked you.

2629
01:12:59,380 --> 01:12:59,820
Guys.

2630
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:00,820
They ran away.

2631
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,920
They ran away?

2632
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:02,420
Yeah.

2633
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:04,960
Last guy.

2634
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,140
That has to be last guy.

2635
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,760
Flash, flash, flash.

2636
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:08,380
Got him.

2637
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,120
There's one more team.

2638
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,420
Okay, okay.

2639
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,460
I got confused.

2640
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:21,600
I got confused.

2641
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:25,400
Accident.

2642
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:27,720
Accident?

2643
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:28,580
Yeah.

2644
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,100
Okay.

2645
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:30,840
I know.

2646
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,740
This is why we keep losing.

2647
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,580
I don't play.

2648
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

2649
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

2650
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,700
I am trying my best.

2651
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:44,620
Okay.

2652
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,400
Nice ult.

2653
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,260
We won.

2654
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,500
Did we not win?

2655
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:50,840
No.

2656
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:52,480
Okay.

2657
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,840
We are going to win.

2658
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,180
Wait.

2659
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:56,700
What?

2660
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,560
You got this.

2661
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,300
Go, go, go.

2662
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,160
Nice.

2663
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:03,980
See?

2664
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,620
So easy.

2665
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:06,420
Okay.

2666
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,540
Nice.

2667
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,060
What a game.

2668
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:12,840
See?

2669
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,200
Even if I ult you, we still won.

2670
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:16,760
Okay?

2671
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:17,960
Okay.

2672
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,680
So this team, we can win.

2673
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:20,880
Yeah.

2674
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,160
It's all about...

2675
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,880
I just need to ult you again and then we win.

2676
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:26,920
Oh no.

2677
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:27,440
Peace.

2678
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:27,720
No.

2679
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,840
Anyone want to battle?

2680
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,760
Yeah, I have five.

2681
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:36,720
Okay.

2682
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,380
How about you, Toh?

2683
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:39,180
Battle?

2684
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,340
Does anyone want these?

2685
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:41,520
Okay.

2686
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:42,660
I have six.

2687
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:43,640
I will give you two.

2688
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,740
Purple stock and...

2689
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,160
Oh, actually I'll take that.

2690
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:50,220
Purple stock and barrel stabilizer.

2691
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,220
Does anyone want that?

2692
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:52,540
Me.

2693
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,360
I'm gonna...

2694
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,580
You want to scan again?

2695
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,240
Can I scan?

2696
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:00,860
Yeah.

2697
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,960
You want to scan again?

2698
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:05,680
Yeah, it's all.

2699
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:06,320
You can scan.

2700
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:06,960
Yeah.

2701
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:08,680
Scan here.

2702
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:10,840
Nothing?

2703
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:12,260
Nothing?

2704
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,240
What the?

2705
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,300
Right here.

2706
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,180
This one.

2707
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:19,600
This one.

2708
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:19,900
Scan.

2709
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:20,420
Right here.

2710
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,640
Someone please give her GPS.

2711
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,520
Yeah.

2712
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:28,640
GPS.

2713
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,240
Maybe that's why we're losing.

2714
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:35,780
Alright.

2715
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,440
Okay.

2716
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,340
I see.

2717
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,360
She was gonna go there.

2718
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,540
Oh, Lava.

2719
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,560
Lava is a lot.

2720
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,880
I feel like he's gonna be...

2721
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,460
Oh my god.

2722
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,760
We're so sure.

2723
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:48,260
See?

2724
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,840
There's no one near us.

2725
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:50,560
Yeah.

2726
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,760
There's no one near us.

2727
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,400
There's a team here.

2728
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,360
Where should we go?

2729
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,860
I feel like...

2730
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,020
Look at the Lava.

2731
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:58,960
Okay.

2732
01:15:58,980 --> 01:15:59,240
Lava.

2733
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:00,780
Go there.

2734
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:01,520
Yeah.

2735
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:01,920
Might as well.

2736
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,780
Or we go here and then kill this team.

2737
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,540
Oh, this way?

2738
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:07,820
Okay.

2739
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:08,460
Yeah.

2740
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,920
Cause they have to come to us.

2741
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:10,900
Okay.

2742
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,820
Oh, big drill.

2743
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,420
Alright.

2744
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,140
We can do this.

2745
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,240
If not champion, top 3.

2746
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,040
Okay.

2747
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:22,640
Top 3.

2748
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,520
I'm... This game.

2749
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,180
Top 3.

2750
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:26,620
Come on.

2751
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,540
Do you don't need champion?

2752
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,100
This game.

2753
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:32,320
No.

2754
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,000
This game.

2755
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,260
This game.

2756
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:34,540
Okay.

2757
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,180
This game.

2758
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,120
Okay.

2759
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:36,440
Okay.

2760
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:40,340
You changed your mind so fast.

2761
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,640
Look.

2762
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,740
We were not lucky for...

2763
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,060
Okay.

2764
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,160
We are not lucky.

2765
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:47,700
Okay.

2766
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,640
You see anybody?

2767
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:49,920
I'm watching.

2768
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,280
I'm looking.

2769
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,680
I see no one.

2770
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,040
I don't see anyone yet.

2771
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I don't see anybody.

2772
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,260
Are they gonna come to us?

2773
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:02,840
They should.

2774
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,480
Far.

2775
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,520
Far.

2776
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,940
Let's see.

2777
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,340
Is there any scans here?

2778
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:12,980
No, there isn't.

2779
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:13,660
Okay.

2780
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,440
I mean, we could... They have to come here.

2781
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,640
Yeah, but...

2782
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,260
I have no clue.

2783
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,180
Where are they?

2784
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,080
They could... They go here or here.

2785
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:23,680
Or tunnels.

2786
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:25,180
Yeah.

2787
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:25,960
Let's just wait.

2788
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,820
But if they...

2789
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,300
If they went to landslide, they will...

2790
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,840
They would meet another...

2791
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,480
Yeah.

2792
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,100
Squad.

2793
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:34,800
That's true.

2794
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,400
We could...

2795
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,180
Why am I the only one who...

2796
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,100
Who have blue armor?

2797
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,060
Because you don't shoot your gun?

2798
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,860
No, I shoot it.

2799
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,100
Because you should have ulted at your teammates.

2800
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,040
No, I know.

2801
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,800
Because I got your ult.

2802
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:00,680
Yeah.

2803
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,860
But I got purple though.

2804
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,080
I ulted you and I got purple.

2805
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,260
Really?

2806
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:08,560
Yeah.

2807
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,560
That's how it works.

2808
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:09,860
Yeah.

2809
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,380
If you ult at me, you get purple.

2810
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:12,720
I see.

2811
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,240
Okay.

2812
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,860
I have to ult at you.

2813
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,200
Yeah.

2814
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:15,420
Yeah.

2815
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:15,560
Yeah.

2816
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,660
Maybe I might get late army.

2817
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,060
Oh, yeah.

2818
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:19,400
True.

2819
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,100
Oh, here.

2820
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:20,700
Right in front of me.

2821
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,100
Almost kicked.

2822
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,400
I didn't hit anything, by the way.

2823
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,480
Oh my god.

2824
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,200
Purple armor.

2825
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,100
Yeah.

2826
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,100
Purple and red.

2827
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:32,840
Guys, I don't know.

2828
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:33,340
I don't feel so good.

2829
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:33,960
They have purple armor.

2830
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:34,180
Wait.

2831
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,260
No.

2832
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:34,700
We have purple.

2833
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,800
You single.

2834
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,580
Oh, they are taking jump tower.

2835
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,700
What are we gonna do?

2836
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,300
Just shoot it.

2837
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,060
They might walk up.

2838
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,060
I think they will walk up.

2839
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:54,860
Yeah.

2840
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:55,000
Yeah.

2841
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,600
The jump pad.

2842
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,180
The jump pad.

2843
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:56,440
The jump pad?

2844
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:56,940
Okay.

2845
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:57,340
Yeah.

2846
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,160
Did you jump pad?

2847
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:59,400
I don't see them.

2848
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:00,820
Are they coming over?

2849
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:00,940
Two over.

2850
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,060
One lane.

2851
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:02,840
Yeah.

2852
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:03,560
They are coming down.

2853
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:04,680
Behind the rock.

2854
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,200
Okay.

2855
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,020
One of us is caked.

2856
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,880
The guy on the line is lying.

2857
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:12,540
Whoa!

2858
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,280
Watch out.

2859
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,580
Almost cracked him.

2860
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:22,760
Cracked him?

2861
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:23,660
Regular cracked.

2862
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,100
Regular cracked.

2863
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,600
Last guy.

2864
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:25,880
Help.

2865
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:26,440
Hold though.

2866
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,080
Do you have Q?

2867
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:29,400
Yeah.

2868
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,020
Behind you.

2869
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:30,160
Here.

2870
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,260
Here.

2871
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,460
Nice.

2872
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,480
Nice one.

2873
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:34,460
Look.

2874
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,040
We did it.

2875
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:36,920
We win.

2876
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,200
We win.

2877
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:38,280
Top three.

2878
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:38,720
Top three.

2879
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:39,860
Okay.

2880
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:40,240
No.

2881
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:40,920
Okay.

2882
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:41,140
I'm top three.

2883
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,660
Don't jinx it.

2884
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,360
Don't jinx it.

2885
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:43,740
Okay.

2886
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,080

01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:52,280

01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,300
Oh, shit.

2901
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:56,840
Eva 8.

2902
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,020
I'm gonna grab the Eva 8.

2903
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,780
I heard Eva 8 is so strong.

2904
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,320
Yeah.

2905
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,020
Yeah.

2906
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,360
Eva 8 is so strong.

2907
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:08,720
Last time I played Eva 8, I hit Nazi.

2908
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,300
So I stopped it.

2909
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,160
So I stopped it.

2910
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:12,220
I stopped playing.

2911
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,000
That's not good.

2912
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:14,460
Okay.

2913
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,360
Maybe we can go from the right side?

2914
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:17,920
Yeah.

2915
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,060
Yeah.

2916
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:18,340
Let's go.

2917
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:19,760
Yeah.

2918
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,100
Yeah.

2919
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,280
Let's go.

2920
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,040
Oh my god.

2921
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:21,780
Maybe top three.

2922
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:23,360
Someone's dying.

2923
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,060
Top three.

2924
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,380
Top three.

2925
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,080
Top three.

2926
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:30,880
Top three.

2927
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,860
Top three.

2928
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,080
Top three.

2929
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,600
Top three.

2930
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:35,720
Stop it.

2931
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,360
Stop it.

2932
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:37,780
Oh, shit.

2933
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:39,860
That's what's in here.

2934
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:43,880
Who's hiding?

2935
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:44,540
Oh, Eva.

2936
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,060
Oh, you are.

2937
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,060
You can play.

2938
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:47,560
I thought I had...

2939
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,200
I have Eva already.

2940
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,360
Get the Eva.

2941
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,200
It's so strong.

2942
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,540
How about two Eva?

2943
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,740
Two Evas?

2944
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,020
Okay.

2945
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,360
You know what?

2946
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,360
Two Evas.

2947
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:55,580
Let's go.

2948
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,500
I'll do it.

2949
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,680
I met Maggie anyway.

2950
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:01,800
Yeah.

2951
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,680
Do it.

2952
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,220
The territory is... Top three.

2953
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:06,580
Let's go.

2954
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:07,740
Top three.

2955
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,240
Top two.

2956
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:10,800
Top two.

2957
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,620
Top two.

2958
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:11,980
Top two.

2959
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:12,460
Top two.

2960
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:12,640
Top two.

2961
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:14,520
Wait.

2962
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:14,980
Wait.

2963
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:15,040
Wait.

2964
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,140
Scan.

2965
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,080
We can scan.

2966
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:16,540
Oh, wait.

2967
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:16,660
No.

2968
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:17,040
We can't.

2969
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:17,880
Never mind.

2970
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:18,320
No scan.

2971
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:18,800
No scan.

2972
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,080
No scan.

2973
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:19,520
No.

2974
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:19,660
No.

2975
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:21,400
Okay.

2976
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:22,420
Okay.

2977
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:23,480
Are they fighting?

2978
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:24,600
Yeah.

2979
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:25,780
Okay.

2980
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,480
Oh, my sky is so low.

2981
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:29,760
Where?

2982
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,040
Where?

2983
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:30,280
Where?

2984
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:30,460
Where?

2985
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:31,040
Keep paying.

2986
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:31,320
Over here.

2987
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,620
I only have close range.

2988
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,480
I have another...

2989
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,340
Another one there.

2990
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,060
I will take... I will go chase...

2991
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:39,540
Please.

2992
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:39,760
Please.

2993
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,040
Please.

2994
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:40,700
Okay.

2995
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,660
I'm coming over.

2996
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,360
Behind.

2997
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,420
Oh, behind.

2998
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:44,800
Behind.

2999
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,060
Behind.

3000
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:45,260
Behind.

3001
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:45,480
Here.

3002
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,020
Under the pole.

3003
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:47,540
Yeah.

3004
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:47,680
Yeah.

3005
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,060
The second team is all over there.

3006
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:51,480
I feel like... Wait.

3007
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:51,880
We're in middle.

3008
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:52,400
We're in middle.

3009
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,100
We should go back.

3010
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:53,740
We should go back.

3011
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:54,440
We're in middle.

3012
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:54,780
Okay.

3013
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,120
We go back.

3014
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:55,700
Yeah.

3015
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:55,860
Wait.

3016
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,360
Let's see.

3017
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,060
Wait.

3018
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,520
Where is good?

3019
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:57,860
Over there?

3020
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,320
There's a team there.

3021
01:21:59,400 --> 01:21:59,780
Isn't it?

3022
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:00,900
Is there a team there?

3023
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,360
Where can we go?

3024
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,440
We're in the middle right now.

3025
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,100
No.

3026
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,020
We're in... Oh, okay.

3027
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:06,980
We can stay here.

3028
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:07,520
It's okay.

3029
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:07,800
It's okay.

3030
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,620
We can stay here.

3031
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,180
Yeah.

3032
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:09,720
We'll stay here.

3033
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,080
We'll stay here.

3034
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,140
Yeah.

3035
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:12,680
There's...

3036
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,600
We're... We're in between two teams.

3037
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:15,920
Yeah.

3038
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,520
Another team there.

3039
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,180
One team there and one team on the left side.

3040
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,440
One team there and one team on the left side.

3041
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:20,440
Guys.

3042
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,400
I have Eva 8.

3043
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:21,800
Guys.

3044
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,900
What do I do?

3045
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,540
What do I do?

3046
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,180
You only have Eva 8.

3047
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,120
We can... We can do it.

3048
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:35,900
I can't do it.

3049
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,260
Okay.

3050
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:36,480
Okay.

3051
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:36,680
Okay.

3052
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,380
They have to... Make them push me.

3053
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,600
It's like a run.

3054
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,260
Okay.

3055
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,500
Okay.

3056
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,120
I can't die.

3057
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,740
If I die, they get two Eva 8s.

3058
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,260
They did it.

3059
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,220
That's too scary.

3060
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,640
I don't want...

3061
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:49,740
Oh, wow.

3062
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,200
They have Horizon.

3063
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,160
They're over here?

3064
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:55,500
Yeah.

3065
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:55,660
Yeah.

3066
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:55,820
Yeah.

3067
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,580
What the f***?

3068
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,020
They're coming.

3069
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:57,580
They're coming.

3070
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:58,100
They're coming.

3071
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,200
They're coming?

3072
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,400
What are they doing?

3073
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:01,820
Stop.

3074
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:02,540
We're gonna get third.

3075
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:03,260
It's... Leave.

3076
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:04,760
Leave.

3077
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:05,820
What are you doing?

3078
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,500
Someone make sure we don't get third.

3079
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,540
Someone make sure we don't get third party.

3080
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,320
I'm gonna make sure.

3081
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:12,540
Okay.

3082
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,520
Someone look right... I'll look behind.

3083
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,000
I'll look behind.

3084
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:15,600
Yeah.

3085
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:15,820
Yeah.

3086
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:15,900
Yeah.

3087
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,520
I don't wanna get thirded.

3088
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,320
Where's the second team?

3089
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,400
Yeah.

3090
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,880
My aim is so good.

3091
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,160
I see the second team over here.

3092
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:30,640
Okay.

3093
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:31,520
Horizon takes...

3094
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,660
Are they trying to push us?

3095
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:33,540
It's fine.

3096
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,120
We have here.

3097
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:34,860
No, it's fine.

3098
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:35,580
They can't.

3099
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:36,600
Yeah.

3100
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,120
They can't.

3101
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:37,480
They can't.

3102
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:38,840
No.

3103
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:39,920
Behind the log.

3104
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:43,660
Alright.

3105
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,440
Team here and...

3106
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,260
And then team here.

3107
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,040
Okay.

3108
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:50,660
We wait.

3109
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,080
They push us.

3110
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:52,160
Oh, s***.

3111
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,020
How many people on the left side?

3112
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,280
I don't know.

3113
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:55,940
I think there's two.

3114
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:56,800
Maybe.

3115
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,840
I'm lucky on my right.

3116
01:23:59,380 --> 01:23:59,860
Okay.

3117
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:00,780
Okay.

3118
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,520
We wait.

3119
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,940
Until zone is small.

3120
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,740
So I can...

3121
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,360
So I can eva-ate.

3122
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:05,760
Yeah.

3123
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:06,040
Yeah.

3124
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:06,180
Yeah.

3125
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:07,820
Nice.

3126
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:08,280
Nice.

3127
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,660
I think they... I feel like they're gonna push us.

3128
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:12,980
I think they...

3129
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:12,980
I feel like they're gonna push us.

3130
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:13,620
It's okay.

3131
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,520
This is our team.

3132
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,980
They push each other.

3133
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:16,560
We have...

3134
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,060
We have zone.

3135
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:17,640
We have zone.

3136
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,300
It's fine.

3137
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,400
Okay.

3138
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:19,640
Okay.

3139
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:19,940
Yeah.

3140
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,300
We wait.

3141
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:20,600
We wait.

3142
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:21,460
We can be patient.

3143
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:21,820
We wait.

3144
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,220
Okay.

3145
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:22,780
Yeah.

3146
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:22,900
Yeah.

3147
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:23,240
We wait.

3148
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,920
We have Horizon and Bangalore.

3149
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:25,860
We wait.

3150
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,780
Horizon stood behind the log.

3151
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:30,440
Here.

3152
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,640
He ran up here.

3153
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,140
I see him.

3154
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:33,480
Oh yeah.

3155
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:33,720
Yeah.

3156
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:33,940
Yeah.

3157
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,140
Yeah.

01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:34,320
Yeah.

3159
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:34,400
Yeah.

3160
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:34,520
Yeah.

3161
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,040
I saw it.

3162
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:35,380
I saw it.

3163
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,040
I'm looking my left right now.

3164
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:41,840
Right here.

3165
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,120
Okay.

3166
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,480
Are you trying to... You look right.

3167
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:44,880
Yeah.

3168
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,740
You look this team.

3169
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:46,860
I look the left team.

3170
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:47,880
Okay.

3171
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,020
Come on.

3172
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,760
Get out of here.

3173
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,720
I want them to fight.

3174
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:52,480
Wait.

3175
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,420
Go get out of here.

3176
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:55,140
What?

3177
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,120
Come here.

3178
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:56,680
Come here.

3179
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,780
Get over here.

3180
01:24:58,980 --> 01:24:59,240
Boom.

3181
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:00,560
Boom.

3182
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:00,800
Boom.

3183
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,400
Yeah.

3184
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,260
It's so scary, isn't it?

3185
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,000
My Eva A.

3186
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:06,760
Yeah.

3187
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,880
Make them fight each other.

3188
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:10,180
Nice.

3189
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,940
I think it's... I don't know if that's one guy.

3190
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:15,360
No.

3191
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:15,700
That's two.

3192
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:15,980
It's two.

3193
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,000
No.

3194
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:18,260
No.

3195
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,500
There's a guy right here.

3196
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,180
Below me.

3197
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:20,580
Below me.

3198
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:20,960
Below me.

3199
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:22,760
Okay.

3200
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,240
They have Horizon.

3201
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,860
Maybe they might...

3202
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,960
They're below me.

3203
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:29,620
I need help.

3204
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:29,860
Wow.

3205
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:30,740
Below me.

3206
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:31,300
Below me too.

3207
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:32,460
Push.

3208
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:32,860
Push.

3209
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,360
No.

3210
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:33,540
No.

3211
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:33,780
No.

3212
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,300
They're not pushing.

3213
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,280
They might push.

3214
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:37,980
They might push now.

3215
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,220
Yeah.

3216
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:38,420
Yeah.

3217
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:38,520
Yeah.

3218
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:40,440
I'm backing up to you, Ditto.

3219
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,680
To get here.

3220
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,140
To get here.

3221
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:42,600
I'm coming.

3222
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,220
I'm coming to you.

3223
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,520
Be careful.

3224
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,000
Be careful.

3225
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,400
I'm behind the log.

3226
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,200
Okay.

3227
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,040
Anyone have energy?

3228
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:50,940
Nope.

3229
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,360
I mean, I have some.

3230
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,000
I have some.

3231
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:54,640
I have some.

3232
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,700
I have some here.

3233
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:57,900
Okay.

3234
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:58,160
Okay.

3235
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,480
I hit one.

3236
01:25:59,620 --> 01:25:59,900
I hit one.

3237
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:03,680
Almost hit one.

3238
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:04,560
I'm coming over.

3239
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:04,880
I'm coming over.

3240
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:05,980
We have to be careful.

3241
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,580
I'm giving you armor.

3242
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:07,960
Yeah.

3243
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,020
Yeah.

3244
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:10,800
Okay.

3245
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,120
Yeah.

3246
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:11,320
Two.

3247
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,240
Yeah.

3248
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:12,420
Yeah.

3249
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,500
Get away from us!

3250
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:15,600
Leave!

3251
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:18,860
I'm backing up.

3252
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:19,240
I'm backing up.

3253
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:19,940
Careful, Ditto.

3254
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:20,220
Careful.

3255
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:20,520
Careful.

3256
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:22,360
You're here.

3257
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:22,600
You're here.

3258
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,260
Oh no.

3259
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:24,260
Wait.

3260
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:24,760
Behind us.

3261
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,300
Oh shit.

3262
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:25,800
Behind.

3263
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:27,100
No!

3264
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:27,900
Why are you there?

3265
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:28,260
Behind us!

3266
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,040
Hide!

3267
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:29,500
Hide!

3268
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:29,620
Hide!

3269
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:31,920
Ditto!

3270
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:32,340
No!

3271
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,020
Okay, they're fighting each other.

3272
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:37,920
They're fighting each other.

3273
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:38,840
We're going down.

3274
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:39,180
Go go.

3275
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:40,500
Wait.

3276
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:40,940
I'm safe.

3277
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:41,380
I'm safe.

3278
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,000
I'm trying to go down.

3279
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:45,500
It's fine.

3280
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:45,860
It's fine.

3281
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,300
Just chill.

3282
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:46,660
Just chill.

3283
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3284
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:49,900
No, no, no.

3285
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3286
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:50,460
No!

3287
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3288
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:51,660
Come here.

3289
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:51,820
Come here.

3290
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:52,180
Come here.

3291
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:52,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3292
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:58,000
Oh my god!

3293
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:05,430
Why are they all on us?

3294
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:08,090
They don't fight each other!

3295
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:09,390
They don't fight each other!

3296
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,330
My two evil aides!

3297
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,470
I told you, top three!

3298
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,390
I told you!

3299
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,710
They don't fight each other!

3300
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,310
Why us?

3301
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,950
We said babies!

3302
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:30,970
Okay, this time.

3303
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:31,770
This time?

3304
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:33,370
This time.

3305
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:35,150
See, I told you, top three!

3306
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:36,630
Top three!

3307
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:41,170
If we say champion, we might get champion.

3308
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:42,130
Okay, okay.

3309
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:42,830
Top two.

3310
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:52,330
Oh my god, they were scared of my evil aide!

3311
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,350
They are so scared!

3312
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:56,990
Oh my god.

3313
01:27:58,430 --> 01:27:59,510
Oh my god.

3314
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,690
You have two evil aides.

3315
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,630
My evil aides.

3316
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:04,410
Oh my god, I don't know you!

3317
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:06,970
I can't do anything!

3318
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:09,270
Everyone was so far!

3319
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:14,950
Everyone was so far!

3320
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,630
Evil aides!

3321
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:25,770
Imagine if you have another gun.

3322
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:27,750
And we might win that fight.

3323
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:31,370
Yeah, if I had another gun that's not 2 evil aides.

3324
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:31,550
Yeah.

3325
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:36,250
I believed you're right.

3326
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,650
Only they use 2 evil aides.

3327
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:45,510
It's my fault.

3328
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:48,750
That was fun.

3329
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,530
He was 16.

3330
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:54,390
Okay.

3331
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:55,830
Yeah, it was stupid.

3332
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:57,410
It was actually very stupid.

3333
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:01,130
So yeah, I believe in us.

3334
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,230
We're in silver.

3335
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:02,850
We're in bronze.

3336
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,610
We don't lose anything if we die.

3337
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:05,750
Yeah.

3338
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:08,210
Oh, I lost...

3339
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,710
You're in silver!

3340
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:13,030
Silver doesn't matter.

3341
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:17,730
It's not that much.

3342
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:18,830
Yeah, exactly.

3343
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:19,790
It's not that much.

3344
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,090
No one retards.

3345
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:23,210
But it does.

3346
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:23,990
Okay, nice.

3347
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:26,650
I'm surr- I still have no hammer point.

3348
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:28,450
Where the fuck is the hammer point?

3349
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,490
I don't see any hammer point.

3350
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:30,870
Yeah.

3351
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:32,570
I haven't seen one either.

3352
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:41,330
Wait, I would've won if I had a third evil aide.

3353
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:44,450
If I could...

3354
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:46,390
If I was the...

3355
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,110
What was his name?

3356
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:49,270
The old man with 3 evil aides.

3357
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:50,050
I would've won.

3358
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,110
Oh, yeah.

3359
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:52,690
Ballistic, yeah.

3360
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:55,250
If I was ballistic, it would be 3 Eva 8s.

3361
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:57,570
3 Eva 8s.

3362
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:59,290
Yeah, 3 Eva 8s ballistic.

3363
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:03,350
Oh my god, alright, alright, alright.

3364
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:10,030
That's what I... That's why I didn't win that fight.

3365
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,590
Okay, I want power and nemesis.

3366
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:17,390
Nemesis.

3367
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:20,450
Power and nemesis.

3368
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,670
I have...

3369
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,250
Nemesis, uh, RE.

3370
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:32,350
Okay, I'm gonna run 30-30.

3371
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,190
Anyone want this?

3372
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:36,430
Run!

3373
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:39,690
Yeah, I do.

3374
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:42,770
I'm coming over.

3375
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:44,530
Okay.

3376
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:47,110
I swear, I haven't seen a single hammer point.

3377
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:48,490
It's been...

3378
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,130
It's been like...

3379
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:52,250
Oh, like an hour and a half.

3380
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:53,310
No hammer point.

3381
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,510
No hammer point.

3382
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,750
I'm so sad.

3383
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:59,590
Life... Life is horrible.

3384
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,530
Life is not fair.

3385
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,850
Life is not fair?

3386
01:31:05,190 --> 01:31:05,530
Yeah.

3387
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,070
I don't get it.

3388
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:11,390
Where is my...

3389
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,130
Where is my hammer point?

3390
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:13,590
Hammer point?

3391
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:15,590
I don't see one.

3392
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:18,790
Let me see.

3393
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:19,830
Hammer point.

3394
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,230
Hammer point.

3395
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:24,810
Hammer point.

3396
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:25,930
I don't see hammer point.

3397
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:28,850
Where is...

3398
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:29,730
There's a prowler.

3399
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:31,630
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

3400
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3401
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:35,630
Maybe it's our comp.

3402
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:41,170
We need to find the perfect comp.

3403
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:41,450
Enemy.

3404
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:42,070
Oh?

3405
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:42,290
Enemy.

3406
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:43,190
We're coming.

3407
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,470
We're coming.

3408
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:44,850
I'm coming.

3409
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:44,970
Where?

3410
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:45,570
I'm coming.

3411
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:48,920
Where?

3412
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:49,900
Where?

3413
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:50,580
Here?

3414
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:51,480
Yeah, here.

3415
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,180
High ground one.

3416
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,400
Okay.

3417
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,780
Yeah, on the high ground.

3418
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,920
Revenant and Bloodhound.

3419
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,640
Okay.

3420
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:04,880
Okay.

3421
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,520
I see them.

3422
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,520
Tracked.

3423
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,000
Nice.

3424
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:09,640
Nice?

3425
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,140
I'm going, I'm going.

3426
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:12,540
Careful.

3427
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:19,600
I'm looking.

3428
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:20,720
Okay.

3429
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,020
I'm out.

3430
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,280
I'm out.

3431
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:23,620
Alright.

3432
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,880
I'll come over to you.

3433
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,520
High ground.

3434
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,120
Oh, fuck.

3435
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:27,940
I might be...

3436
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:28,720
Oh, I'm good.

3437
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,000
I'm good.

3438
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:29,340
I'm okay.

3439
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:30,780
I'm okay.

3440
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:32,480
Nice.

3441
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:32,920
I knocked one.

3442
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:33,780
On me, on me, on me.

3443
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,420
Oh my god.

3444
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,640
He fucking ran at me.

3445
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:37,060
Careful, careful.

3446
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:41,260
I'm helping.

3447
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:44,960
On you, on you, on you.

3448
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:45,420
No, no, no.

3449
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:47,820
I'm on the ground.

3450
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:48,340
Hey, last guy.

3451
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:48,700
Last guy.

3452
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:48,900
Yeah.

3453
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:50,700
Woo.

3454
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:51,380
Ta-dah.

3455
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:52,720
Later.

3456
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:03,340
He's so much better.

3457
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,700
Yeah, fuck you.

3458
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:09,280
Go back to Sylvie with us.

3459
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,160
Oh my god.

3460
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:10,840
Nice.

3461
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:12,740
Nice.

3462
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:13,620
Nice.

3463
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:13,940
Nice.

3464
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:15,420
Let's go.

3465
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,280
Let's go.

3466
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,240
Let's go, guys.

3467
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,500
Okay, I have to heal first.

3468
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,240
Hammer point.

3469
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,160
No hammer point.

3470
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:24,280
Nice.

3471
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,200
No point.

3472
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:25,600
No hammer point.

3473
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,420
I'm gonna slow heal.

3474
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,840
I don't wanna waste my medkit.

3475
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:40,820
Yeah they did.

3476
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:43,900
Oh that rev.

3477
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:45,620
That was so scary.

3478
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,500
Yeah that rev was... You know what?

3479
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,820
Now I know.

3480
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:53,680
I need to play rev.

3481
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,040
If I play rev... You gonna play rev?

3482
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:01,860
If I play rev champion...

3483
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,980
It's cause I wasn't on rev.

3484
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:10,060
Do we have any beacons?

3485
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,180
What did they buff, Liv and Ann?

3486
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:13,100
Nothing.

3487
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,800
I don't know.

3488
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,380
I don't know but rev seems strong.

3489
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,380
Which one...

3490
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,400
Where do we go?

3491
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,720
Futo, where do we go?

3492
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:31,860
Futo.

3493
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:32,560
Epicenter.

3494
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,520
Yeah yeah yeah.

3495
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:36,480
We have scanner too.

3496
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:39,020
We can see a scan here first!

3497
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,360
Oh yeah.

3498
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,240
Oh yeah.

3499
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,240
Oh my god.

3500
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:45,760
We forgot.

3501
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:49,360
Sorry our monitors are turned off again.

3502
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,790
Let me shake, let me shake.

3503
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,400
Where are people?

3504
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,300
Nobody.

3505
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,240
Oh, here!

3506
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:06,700
Wait.

3507
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,820
Here, one team!

3508
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,400
Oh!

3509
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:08,420
Oh!

3510
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:09,060
Near us.

3511
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:10,260
Yeah, yeah.

3512
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,460
They know us.

3513
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:12,680
No...

3514
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,220
That's what?

3515
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,120
Pathfinder?

3516
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,560
Pathfinder and what was that?

3517
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:17,120
Wraith?

3518
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,680
Okay, I'm heading over.

3519
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,060
Okay.

3520
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,480
They're still looting.

3521
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,260
Okay, I'll walk over.

3522
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:29,020
If I die, I might die.

3523
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,560
If you die, I... I...

3524
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,100
You clutch.

3525
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:32,400
I land.

3526
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:33,660
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3527
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,020
You clutch.

3528
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,060
Okay.

3529
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,100
You clutch, remember.

3530
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,080
If I die, Uto crush.

3531
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:40,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3532
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:42,220
So...

3533
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,000
It's good, it's good, it's good.

3534
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:44,480
Inside, inside?

3535
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:45,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3536
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,780
Octane almost kicked through army.

3537
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,660
Yeah, there's one guy below us.

3538
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:00,090
Over there?

3539
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:00,790
Yeah.

3540
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:02,710
Careful of under.

3541
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:08,570
Whoa!

3542
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:10,070
Okay, I'm backing out a little.

3543
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:10,590
I'm backing out.

3544
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:13,650
Be careful, they might grapple.

3545
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:14,110
They might zip.

3546
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:14,530
Careful.

3547
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:15,910
Okay.

3548
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:17,810
Healing?

3549
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:23,770
I'm gonna... I'm gonna do this so they don't come out.

3550
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:24,350
Oh, wait.

3551
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:24,990
Sorry.

3552
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:25,810
I missed.

3553
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:28,610
Oh, careful.

3554
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,280
Scan.

3555
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:35,480
Nice scan.

3556
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,980
Maybe one guy might... so close to us.

3557
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:40,920
Be careful, be careful.

3558
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,200
I need a shield cell.

3559
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,420
Oh, I hear them beside me.

3560
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,500
They might... Oh, here.

3561
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,560
Below me.

3562
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,400
Right here.

3563
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,040
Octane, crush.

3564
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:55,840
Careful, careful.

3565
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:56,760
Uto, heal, heal.

3566
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,460
Scan, scan.

3567
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:58,100
Heal Uto.

3568
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:00,860
Under, under, under.

3569
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:01,740
I knocked one, I knocked one.

3570
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:02,440
Knocked one?

3571
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:02,980
Okay, I'm coming over.

3572
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:03,440
Nice.

3573
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,120
Okay, okay, okay.

3574
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:05,160
Ready?

3575
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:09,280
I need help, though.

3576
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,800
I'm back, I'm still... Oh, no.

3577
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,380
Oh, so low, so low.

3578
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,360
I can't, I can't.

3579
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:14,640
Oh.

3580
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,400
Another team, another team, another team.

3581
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:17,740
Another team?

3582
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,840
Okay, I'm backing, I'm backing up.

3583
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:19,900
Yeah.

3584
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,520
Careful here.

3585
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,620
Behind, in front of you.

3586
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,180
Yeah.

3587
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:24,940
This is bad.

3588
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:25,860
Careful.

3589
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:28,920
Oh.

3590
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:29,920
Oh.

3591
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:32,840
Oh.

3592
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:33,140
Oh.

3593
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:33,180
Oh.

3594
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:33,340
Oh.

3595
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:33,600
Oh.

3596
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:36,150
Oh.

3597
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:36,490
Oh.

3598
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:37,750
What, where are you guys?

3599
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:38,130
Oh, we're going to get out of here.

3600
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:39,790
Okay, okay.

3601
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:40,370
Be honest.

3602
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:41,070
I know, I know.

3603
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:41,830
I have to leave, I have to leave.

3604
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:41,970
We're fighting each other.

3605
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:42,330
Yeah.

3606
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,490
I'm doing some acting, guys.

3607
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:44,790
Yeah.

3608
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:46,730
There's no point in fighting this.

3609
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:49,450
Somebody kill me.

3610
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:52,490
Someone kill me.

3611
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:53,930
Please.

3612
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:54,850
There's no one.

3613
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:56,810
There's someone saw me.

3614
01:37:56,810 --> 01:37:57,750
Crawl to them!

3615
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:58,230
Crawl to them!

3616
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:58,230
Why?

3617
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:00,410
Keep ignoring me!

3618
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:01,490
Crawl to them!

3619
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:04,430
I can't craft you if you're still alive!

3620
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:06,230
Oh...

3621
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:07,390
Dino, die!

3622
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:10,290
Okay, I will go to you.

3623
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:10,590
Crawl to them!

3624
01:38:11,110 --> 01:38:12,570
I will go to you.

3625
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:17,330
Dino, I can't craft because you're still alive!

3626
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:21,070
Dino, crawl to them!

3627
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:22,670
Make them kill you!

3628
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,430
You can't!

3629
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:25,550
I almost died!

3630
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:26,470
I almost died!

3631
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,630
I almost died!

3632
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:30,110
Wait, wait!

3633
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:32,550
I will craft right now!

3634
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:34,170
Dino, crawl to them right now!

3635
01:38:34,890 --> 01:38:35,410
Okay!

3636
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,250
Okay!

3637
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:38,110
Wait, wait!

3638
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,390
I'm going to die soon!

3639
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:40,870
I'm dead!

3640
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:42,290
Okay!

3641
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:49,310
Dino, why did you die faster?

3642
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:51,670
Oh, sorry!

3643
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:53,410
I'm sorry!

3644
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:55,730
Okay, I'm resting.

3645
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,070
Okay.

3646
01:38:58,230 --> 01:39:00,450
We lay here and we go...

3647
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:01,170
Okay.

3648
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,470
Why did no one kill you?

3649
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:10,550
Why did no one kill you?

3650
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:11,410
They don't kill me!

3651
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:13,390
No one wanted to kill you!

3652
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:14,070
You were alive!

3653
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:16,290
You were alive for too long.

3654
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:17,950
Oh my god!

3655
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,750
Maybe I'm too useless.

3656
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:23,410
They feel so bad.

3657
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:24,230
They feel so sorry for you.

3658
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,470
They didn't want to kill you.

3659
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:27,070
They're like, no.

3660
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:28,770
It's too sad.

3661
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:30,610
Yeah...

3662
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:33,530
Okay.

3663
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:36,410
Wow.

3664
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:38,310
Oh my god, there's actually...

3665
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:39,050
I'm so fast.

3666
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:42,830
Alright, let's go check epicenter then.

3667
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,410
They're still fighting!

3668
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:46,790
You want to look at it?

3669
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:47,230
I know.

3670
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:49,350
Do you want it?

3671
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:50,550
We can look at it.

3672
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:51,710
We don't have to fight.

3673
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:53,150
It's over.

3674
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:54,310
Oh yeah, it's over.

3675
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:57,530
I want to take high ground though just in case.

3676
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:01,610
Can we loot here?

3677
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:02,570
Yeah, you guys can loot here.

3678
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:05,590
I'm just making sure our high ground is safe.

3679
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:06,630
It's looted but okay.

3680
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,170
Yeah, see if there's extra loot.

3681
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:11,850
Did we scan epi yet?

3682
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:12,630
No, right?

3683
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:13,650
No.

3684
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:14,910
Yeah, we took a scan epi.

3685
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:17,350
Epi, okay.

3686
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:18,110
Yeah, scan.

3687
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:19,890
Okay, okay.

3688
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:20,850
Scan epi.

3689
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:23,630
I have some valley here.

3690
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,210
I like new crafting.

3691
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:34,090
It's so fast.

3692
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:36,430
Yeah, but you can only craft once.

3693
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:38,490
Yeah.

3694
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:41,070
You're fighting on the high ground here.

3695
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:42,510
Okay.

3696
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:48,720
I'm trying to make sure our high ground is safe.

3697
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,400
Oh, I see people here.

3698
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:51,560
Okay.

3699
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:54,180
Oh.

3700
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:55,600
I'll take out a zone soon.

3701
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,880
Okay, I'm at the high ground.

3702
01:40:59,260 --> 01:40:59,520
Red armor?

3703
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,800
I want to make sure they don't come to us.

3704
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:04,420
These guys.

3705
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:08,820
Oh, they're on team there.

3706
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:10,640
Oh no!

3707
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,260
One team, one guy, one guy, guys!

3708
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:13,640
One guy, one guy!

3709
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,300
Team right here where I'm looking at.

3710
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,400
Okay.

3711
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:19,200
This guy.

3712
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,620
This team is coming to us?

3713
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:25,380
This team, this team, this team, this team.

3714
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:25,800
Okay, okay, okay.

3715
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,760
Yeah, there's a team coming to us here.

3716
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,860
I'm coming to you guys.

3717
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,260
I can't give you...

3718
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,660
Wait, oh shit!

3719
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,340
Okay.

3720
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:36,040
There's a team here.

3721
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:36,760
You're okay?

3722
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,760
I'm dead, I'm dead.

3723
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,920
The team came to me.

3724
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3725
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:43,360
It's fine.

3726
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,240
Leave me, leave me, leave me.

3727
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,660
You guys can craft me.

3728
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,860
Wait, I'll die to zone.

3729
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,500
I'll die to zone.

3730
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:50,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3731
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,880
I'm dying to zone and you can craft me.

3732
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,260
Okay, I will revive you here.

3733
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:54,760
Yeah.

3734
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,160
I didn't realize how fast they were to me.

3735
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:01,240
I heard they were that close.

3736
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:04,040
That's how you die, Ditto.

3737
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,380
That's...

3738
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:05,880
Why?

3739
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,420
That's how you die.

3740
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:11,440
Why?

3741
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:15,500
Why?

3742
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:17,800
Wait, wait.

3743
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:18,260
Where's the...

3744
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:19,940
Where's the place?

3745
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:20,940
Where's the rest?

3746
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:21,380
Yeah.

3747
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,020
Where is it?

3748
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:27,800
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3749
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:29,320
Oh, shit!

3750
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:31,400
Oh, he's trying to get...

3751
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,280
Okay, okay, it's fine.

3752
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:32,780
Just rest.

3753
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,640
Yeah, Utho can cover.

3754
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:36,680
Okay, okay.

3755
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,580
Come on, come on.

3756
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:38,580
Come on.

3757
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:39,980
Come on.

3758
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,220
Maybe...

3759
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,440
I think he was trying to rest.

3760
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,720
I think he wanted to rest.

3761
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,500
That's really it.

3762
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,300
Alright, nice.

3763
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,140
I have zero...

3764
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:58,200
We gotta go to zone.

3765
01:42:59,420 --> 01:42:59,960
Let's go.

3766
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,500
We're so poor.

3767
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:04,520
No ammo.

3768
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:06,840
No ammo?

3769
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:08,880
Heavy.

3770
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:12,840
I don't have it.

3771
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,100
Oh, below us.

3772
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:14,720
Below us, right here.

3773
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:16,600
Is this a team?

3774
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,320
I think this is a team.

3775
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,300
Yeah, there's one team.

3776
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:20,440
Nice.

3777
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,720
I need a healer.

3778
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,160
No team, no team, no team.

3779
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:25,600
Careful.

3780
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:29,300
I'm looking.

3781
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:31,560
Come to me, Utho.

3782
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:32,620
Come to me, come to me, come to me.

3783
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,500
Back up, back up, back up.

3784
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,280
I think we need to go a different way.

3785
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:38,820
We might have to go drop down.

3786
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:43,540
Whoa, whoa, be careful.

3787
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:45,940
Nice to ask that.

3788
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,980
Oh, I saw him.

3789
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:50,880
Nice, nice, nice.

3790
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:51,840
I saw him.

3791
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,040
We can be right below them.

3792
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:56,540
Yeah.

3793
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:57,340
Yeah.

3794
01:43:58,540 --> 01:43:59,500
We stay up here.

3795
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:00,420
They can't do anything.

3796
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,060
Oh, look over there.

3797
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:05,380
They can't do anything about us here.

3798
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,260
Let's say drop down.

3799
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,180
I don't think they'll drop down.

3800
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,900
They're not.

3801
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:10,680
Yeah, they won't want to.

3802
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,040
Okay, they missed.

3803
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:17,060
Do you have shields or no?

3804
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:17,340
Okay.

3805
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,080
I have a health shield.

3806
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:27,230
Don't worry, we're safe.

3807
01:44:28,230 --> 01:44:29,630
We're so safe.

3808
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:30,770
We're so healthy.

3809
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:33,230
We're so healthy.

3810
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:38,090
Okay, we're fine.

3811
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:39,390
Okay.

3812
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:42,170
We're so healthy.

3813
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:44,010
Do you have shield cells, Uto?

3814
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:46,390
I have a health shield.

3815
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:48,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3816
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:50,650
I will give you guy Q.

3817
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:51,410
Okay.

3818
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:54,150
Oh my god, no, no.

3819
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:55,010
We can't, we can't.

3820
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:58,230
This team is going to drop down on us.

3821
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:00,530
Unless...

3822
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:00,550
Okay.

3823
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:02,890
Okay.

3824
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:05,450
Oh my god, leave us alone.

3825
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:09,310
Oh my god, leave us alone.

3826
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,590
We're so poor.

3827
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:12,050
Yeah.

3828
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:13,130
Okay, wait.

3829
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:15,010
Do you think we can run?

3830
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:15,570
Okay, who?

3831
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:20,250
Okay, get ready.

3832
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:24,150
Three, two, one, go.

3833
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:25,390
We run.

3834
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:26,710
Come here, come here, come here.

3835
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:28,390
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3836
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:30,890
Okay, okay, okay.

3837
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:32,790
Careful, be careful here.

3838
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,630
In front of me, in front of me.

3839
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:36,130
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

3840
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:36,570
Let's go, guys, go.

3841
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:37,750
Go first, go first.

3842
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:40,670
Go, go, go, go, go.

3843
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:43,230
Go, go, go, go, go.

3844
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:45,190
Don't look back, don't look back.

3845
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:46,690
Don't look back, don't look back.

3846
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:49,710
Okay, okay, okay.

3847
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:51,070
We're safe, we're safe.

3848
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:51,490
What the fuck?

3849
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:52,770
What the fuck?

3850
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:55,690
What the fuck?

3851
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:00,950
Close the door on us.

3852
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:01,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3853
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:02,950
Come here, come here, come here.

3854
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:06,050
One, okay, okay, okay.

3855
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:06,330
It's me.

3856
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:10,490
Okay, okay, okay.

3857
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:11,770
Other team, other team to my right.

3858
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,470
Keep it on the side.

3859
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:15,930
I got him, I got him, I got him.

3860
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,970
Last team over here.

3861
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:19,110
Nice one, nice one.

3862
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:20,410
Here, here, here.

3863
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:25,170
Okay, I'm gonna try to charge my ult.

3864
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:26,290
Oh, shit.

3865
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:29,250
Okay, okay, I'm trying to get my ult.

3866
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:30,550
I'm burning one.

3867
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:36,490
He's on...

3868
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:38,010
It's a rev.

3869
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,090
Careful, Zeno.

3870
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:47,520
Oh no.

3871
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,240
I'm coming over.

3872
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,060
Oh no!

3873
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,360
No!

3874
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:55,100
Top two!

3875
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:56,200
We did it!

3876
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,020
Top two!

3877
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,420

We did our best.

3882
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:17,600
We were so poor.

3883
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:19,860
But we did it.

3884
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,560
Why are we always so poor?

3885
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,380
We were so poor.

3886
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:28,420
We were so poor.

3887
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:28,940
We were so poor.

3888
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:29,980
Okay, now...

3889
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,000
Now champion.

3890
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:32,780
I'm Revenant.

3891
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,020

3892
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,640
I'm playing Mystery Heroes right now.

3893
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,940

Yeah.

3897
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:51,360
Ahhhh.

3898
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,440
This is it.

3899
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:54,060
Nice, nice, nice.

3900
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:55,600
Nice, nice.

3901
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,600
Oh my gosh.

3902
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:04,770
There's no way.

3903
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,390
We can't...

3904
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:06,590
We can't fuck up.

3905
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:07,350
We can't.

3906
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:08,690
We got top three.

3907
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:10,130
We got top two.

3908
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:11,250
Now it's champion.

3909
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:12,590
Champion.

3910
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:12,790
Champion.

3911
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:15,170
Go!

3912
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:17,230

01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:24,870
Reduce tactical cooldown.

3915
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:26,050
Which one's good?

3916
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:30,110
Ahhhh.

3917
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:32,770
We were so poor but we still get...

3918
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:33,910
Um, second.

3919
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:36,330
We were so poor.

3920
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:38,230
We were so poor.

3921
01:48:38,570 --> 01:48:40,490
I don't know how we did that.

3922
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:42,570
I don't know how we were able to...

3923
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:44,390
We died like twice.

3924
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:46,650
Attack for more.

3925
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:47,790

3929
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:57,530
Okay.

3930
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:00,430
Oh no, I should get...

3931
01:49:00,430 --> 01:49:02,350
Agile Assassin and Grim Reaper.

3932
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:04,090
Yeah, only one.

3933
01:49:04,490 --> 01:49:05,890
Alright, we got this.

3934
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:08,950
Um, I will...

3935
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:10,310
I will land here.

3936
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:11,510
I'm landing here.

3937
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:12,190
Oh no, two teams.

3938
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:12,510
Two teams.

3939
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:14,570
Oh no, three teams.

3940
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:15,270
Three teams.

3941
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:15,830
What the heck?

3942
01:49:15,890 --> 01:49:16,630
Wait, three teams?

3943
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:17,350
That's not good.

3944
01:49:18,690 --> 01:49:19,130
Wait.

3945
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:21,410
Did I just hear someone near me?

3946
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:24,130
Yeah, someone near you.

3947
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:25,290
Yeah, someone's near me.

3948
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:25,510
For sure.

3949
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,260
I have like this.

3950
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:32,800
Yeah, someone's near me.

3951
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,380
Be careful, Doki.

3952
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:35,340
Yeah.

3953
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:36,720
Yeah.

3954
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,720
I'm coming over.

3955
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:42,600
Please don't get shot.

3956
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:43,320
Please don't get shot.

3957
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:44,700
I'm okay.

3958
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:45,140
I'm okay.

3959
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:45,600
I'm okay.

3960
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,900
Are we gonna fight them?

3961
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:48,300
No?

3962
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,040
Do it.

3963
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:49,440
Let's go.

3964
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:50,500
We're in silver.

3965
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:50,900
Go?

3966
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:52,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3967
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:52,720
We're in silver.

3968
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,400
Okay, okay, okay.

3969
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,000
I don't know where they are though.

3970
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,660
Inside this building?

3971
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:57,780
Inside this one, I think.

3972
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:58,040
Yeah.

3973
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,280
Careful, Ditto.

3974
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:00,840
You're by yourself.

3975
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,200
Woohoohoohoo!

3976
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:04,420
Nice.

3977
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,160
Nice.

3978
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:06,440
I got to heal myself.

3979
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:10,720
Oh, very low.

3980
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,760
Revenant very low.

3981
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,160
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

3982
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:14,000
I wanna know where...

3983
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:15,840
Where, where, where is Revenant?

3984
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:20,030
Splash?

3985
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:20,410
Nice.

3986
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:22,590
Nice one!

3987
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:27,170
Maybe that's... Oh, that's Rev?

3988
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:27,710
Nice!

3989
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:28,590
Oh, you paid Rev!

3990
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:29,610
Yeah, see?

3991
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:32,410
We just need Rev.

3992
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:33,230
We just need Rev.

3993
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:33,990
Rev champion.

3994
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:39,410
Okay, I need...

3995
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:41,350
Silence.

3996
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:43,110
I need like 150.

3997
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:44,230
I need 150 for...

3998
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:47,190
Wait, is there more?

3999
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:48,890
Oh, already got all of this.

4000
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:51,630
Oh, I should have used my med kit.

4001
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:52,610
I didn't want waste.

4002
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:56,310
Double charger.

4003
01:50:58,270 --> 01:50:59,190
Up, up, up, up.

4004
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:00,870
Do you have more syringes or no?

4005
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:02,090
In a station?

4006
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:04,890
Do you have syringes or no?

4007
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,950
Um, I have two.

4008
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:08,910
Okay, I have like... I'm good.

4009
01:51:08,910 --> 01:51:09,150
It's fine.

4010
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:11,030
I have zero.

4011
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,530
I didn't... I thought I had more.

4012
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:13,090
Oh, I have all of them!

4013
01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:14,770
Nice!

4014
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,430
Okay.

4015
01:51:16,370 --> 01:51:17,490
Do you need one?

4016
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:19,250
I can get you one.

4017
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:19,330
Okay.

4018
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:20,390
No, it's fine.

4019
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:20,590
It's fine.

4020
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:22,110
I have ult.

4021
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,750
Nice.

4022
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:24,650
Okay.

4023
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:26,490
They're all high ground though.

4024
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:28,990
The guy right here.

4025
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:31,990
I can upgrade my push.

4026
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:32,610
What do you think?

4027
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:33,750
It's mine!

4028
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:36,650
Whoa, so careful, careful.

4029
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:37,450
Be careful, be careful.

4030
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:38,310
Can you Q her?

4031
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:41,870
Are they pushing or no?

4032
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:44,030
No, no, no.

4033
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:44,310
They're not.

4034
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:47,330
They're not pushing.

4035
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:48,290
They're not pushing.

4036
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:52,850
I feel like we can chill.

4037
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:53,970
Do we have enough meds?

4038
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:56,430
I don't have...

4039
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:59,250
I don't feel... I don't know if we should fight this.

4040
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:00,390
We don't have a lot of meds.

4041
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:01,210
We can back up.

4042
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:01,550
Yeah.

4043
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:03,710
Let's just back up.

4044
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:04,310
Yeah.

4045
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:05,870
And loot more.

4046
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:06,210
Yeah.

4047
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:08,890
I don't think we have enough heals for this.

4048
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:09,490
Wait, wait, wait.

4049
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:10,190
Another team here.

4050
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:11,170
Another team.

4051
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:12,130
We have to go.

4052
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:14,310
Go left, go left, go left.

4053
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,710
Another team all night.

4054
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:18,030
That's why I won't go here.

4055
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:19,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4056
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:21,110
Nice, nice, nice.

4057
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:21,890
That's a wingman.

4058
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:23,810
Oh my god, that's a wingman.

4059
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:24,490
No!

4060
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:26,070
We don't have the heals for this.

4061
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:28,730
We're too poor.

4062
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:29,970
Not looted?

4063
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:31,570
Not looted?

4064
01:52:31,670 --> 01:52:31,990
Wait, no.

4065
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,850
Looted, looted, looted.

4066
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:33,270
Oh, he's looted.

4067
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:34,950
Maybe they're scraps.

4068
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:36,830
Maybe that's the team.

4069
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:38,810
There's stuff here.

4070
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:41,030
Oh, here.

4071
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:42,050
Enemy, enemy!

4072
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:43,390
Enemy, enemy, enemy.

4073
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,990
Okay, okay.

4074
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:47,470
Where should we go?

4075
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:50,070
We could go back.

4076
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:51,550
I don't have a lot of heals.

4077
01:52:52,090 --> 01:52:52,930
Me too.

4078
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:53,970
Let's go, let's go.

4079
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:54,870
Yeah.

4080
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:56,030
I don't want to fight.

4081
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,030
Okay, okay.

4082
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,590
My heals are so bad.

4083
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:02,430
Me too.

4084
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:04,450
I only have two silenies.

4085
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:04,770
Baby.

4086
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:06,670
I have zero survivors.

4087
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:07,130
I have no syringes.

4088
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,550
I'm just a little...

4089
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:11,010
Baby!

4090
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:14,070
Hello, I cried out.

4091
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:17,230
Oh my god, the way you call me is so cute.

4092
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:20,350
Creepy!

4093
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:20,810
What?

4094
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:24,510
I'm just a...

4095
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:25,170
Baby!

4096
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:27,290
What the fuck?

4097
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:31,970
Where is the syringes?

4098
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:34,070
I can't get one.

4099
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:35,150
No.

4100
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:35,990
No!

4101
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:36,970
I'm crazy.

4102
01:53:37,030 --> 01:53:37,850
I already jumped.

4103
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:39,090
I jumped already.

4104
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:43,090
Where the fuck are the syringes?

4105
01:53:44,430 --> 01:53:45,390
This is looted.

4106
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:46,370
This is looted!

4107
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:47,630
Okay.

4108
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:50,950
Oh no, it's half looted.

4109
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:53,330
Nice.

4110
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:54,150
I swear to god.

4111
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:55,330
There's people fighting above me?

4112
01:53:56,290 --> 01:53:56,850
Like here?

4113
01:53:58,430 --> 01:53:59,470
Oh yeah, yeah.

4114
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:00,410
One team above you.

4115
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:02,250
Careful, careful.

4116
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:04,710
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4117
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:06,290
Maybe we can...

4118
01:54:06,290 --> 01:54:07,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4119
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:09,330
Shoot them back.

4120
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:11,490
Oh shit.

4121
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:14,230
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

4122
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:15,670
Shh.

4123
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:17,610
I'm coming, I'm coming.

4124
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:19,130
Shh.

4125
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:24,010
I think they know, they know.

4126
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:25,770
Oh, they...

4127
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:28,610
Yeah, they do.

4128
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:29,610
They do.

4129
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:33,030
They knew, they knew.

4130
01:54:33,610 --> 01:54:34,610
I can't point it.

4131
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:35,990
I'm going back up.

4132
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:37,590
Kill me, kill me, kill me.

4133
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:40,330
Back, back, back.

4134
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:40,690
Oh, back?

4135
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:41,070
Okay.

4136
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:42,510
Okay, okay.

4137
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:45,070
We don't have, we don't have...

4138
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:45,530
No!

4139
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,050
Hello, I'm back.

4140
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:52,830
I need 13 more!

4141
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:56,930
Oh my god, we're so poor again.

4142
01:54:57,330 --> 01:54:58,750
Why are we always...

4143
01:54:58,750 --> 01:54:59,670
No money!

4144
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:01,910
Where's our money?

4145
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:03,730
Please donate.

4146
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:05,770
A lot of silencers.

4147
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:08,530
Can you guys pick that up for me?

4148
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:10,130
I'm too lazy.

4149
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:15,050
Can someone donate us some money to...

4150
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:16,690
So we can not be poor.

4151
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:20,190
Can I have some silencers?

4152
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:21,310
Oh, nice.

4153
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:25,570
Donate your materials to us.

4154
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:28,330
Okay, I'm going to go grab...

4155
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:29,630
The evil.

4156
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:31,890
Oh yeah, I'm so close to evil.

4157
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:33,110
Maybe we can go to the selfie cam.

4158
01:55:33,330 --> 01:55:34,070
How about selfie cam?

4159
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:35,070
Let's go there.

4160
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:39,550
Where the f**k is...

4161
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:40,710
Yeah, I'm like 13 from...

4162
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:41,450
13.

4163
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:45,530
I want to go up too.

4164
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:46,790
We're team poverty.

4165
01:55:47,110 --> 01:55:47,990
We're so poor.

4166
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:50,530
I'll grab the evil harvester.

4167
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:52,390
Okay.

4168
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:54,550
Oh no, there's one team here.

4169
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:55,930
Alright, there's a team here?

4170
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,570
Yeah, they just take the save.

4171
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:00,790
Leave!

4172
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:02,310
Leave!

4173
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:05,590
We want to loot!

4174
01:56:05,630 --> 01:56:06,070
Leave!

4175
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:07,510
We want to loot!

4176
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,510
Leave!

4177
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,550
Hey!

4178
01:56:08,030 --> 01:56:08,570
Hey!

4179
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:08,990
Hey!

4180
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:09,090
Hey!

4181
01:56:09,150 --> 01:56:11,970
I have like short range.

4182
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:16,690
I f**ked that up.

4183
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:17,010
I f**ked that up.

4184
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:18,910
Oh my god.

4185
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:20,050
There's nothing here.

4186
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:22,330
There's loot!

4187
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:25,090
That's not alert.

4188
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:26,150
Wait, where did he go?

4189
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:28,410
Oh, he went all the way there.

4190
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:29,250
Is he rezzing?

4191
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:30,090
I think he's rezzing.

4192
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:31,570
Oh, you're okay?

4193
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:32,730
Yeah, yeah, he's rezzing.

4194
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:34,030
We throw this.

4195
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:35,010
They have loot!

4196
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:35,330
Go!

4197
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:35,850
Go!

4198
01:56:35,890 --> 01:56:36,170
Go!

4199
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,910
Go!

4200
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,390
Go!

4201
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:37,690

01:56:42,110 --> 01:56:42,350
Okay!

4208
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:42,450
Okay!

4209
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:44,070
We're going to be less poor here.

4210
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,390
I'm going on the back.

4211
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:47,030
I'm going on the back.

4212
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:49,630
I'm flanking.

4213
01:56:49,730 --> 01:56:50,010
I'm flanking.

4214
01:56:53,690 --> 01:56:54,330
Where are they?

4215
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:55,150
Careful.

4216
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:55,410
Careful.

4217
01:56:58,410 --> 01:56:59,390
I'm going to tunnel.

4218
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:01,050
Any help?

4219
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:03,970

4220
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:05,430
I'm coming.

4221
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,550
Crypto cracked!

4222
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:10,990

4223
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:12,490
Crypto cracked!

4224
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:12,490

4225

01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:17,510
Careful!

4231
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,870
Careful!

4232
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:18,410
Careful!

4233
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:19,410
Careful!

4234
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:22,990
Just there.

4235
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:25,250
I'm healing.

4236
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:25,670
I'm healing.

4237
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:26,790
Wait, what the f**k?

4238
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:28,390
Why is that so low?

4239
01:57:28,410 --> 01:57:29,890
Rob him!

4240
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:31,210
Take his money!

4241
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:33,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4242
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:33,970
We thirsted one.

4243
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:36,750
Team behind!

4244
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:37,170
Team behind!

4245
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:38,730
Team behind!

4246
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:39,050
Team behind!

4247
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:40,770
Okay, okay, okay.

4248
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:41,650
Oh my god.

4249
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:42,530
I have nothing.

4250
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:44,470
We still have nothing.

4251
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:46,030
We couldn't rob the guy.

4252
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:49,350
I'm going to rob the guy.

4253
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:49,850
I'm going to rob the guy.

4254
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:50,350
Okay.

4255
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:50,450
Okay.

4256
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:57,930
Leave us alone!

4257
01:57:58,630 --> 01:57:59,030
Please!

4258
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:00,570
We just watched them move!

4259
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:01,050
Oh my god!

4260
01:58:01,070 --> 01:58:01,650
They're pushed!

4261
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:01,930
They're pushed!

4262
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:02,490
They're going to push!

4263
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:03,430
The seam?

4264
01:58:04,130 --> 01:58:04,530
Yeah.

4265
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:05,030
Okay.

4266
01:58:06,010 --> 01:58:08,050
I'm looking... I'm looking behind them.

4267
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:08,730
I'm looking right!

4268
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:09,170
I'm looking right!

4269
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:11,330
Yeah, I'm looking left.

4270
01:58:11,490 --> 01:58:11,990
I'm going to...

4271
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:14,650
I'm covering left right now.

4272
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:19,960
Are they going to push us?

4273
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:20,440
No, they're not.

4274
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:20,700
They're not.

4275
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:21,200
They're not.

4276
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:23,560
I think so?

4277
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:24,420
One's close.

4278
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:24,840
One's close.

4279
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,020
One's close.

4280
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:26,460
Okay.

4281
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,280
I hear him.

4282
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:29,900
Okay.

4283
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:31,280
If they push, I would...

4284
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:33,160
He's super close.

4285
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:33,660
He's super close.

4286
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:34,100
Do you have Q?

4287
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:35,040

4288
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:37,960

4289
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,180

4305
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,160

Finally!

4312
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:16,100
Finally!

4313
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:17,500
We have money!

4314
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:20,720
That was so sad.

4315
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,860
That was like the saddest game.

4316
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:25,960
Okay.

4317
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,600
I heard people...

4318
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,940
Oh wait, nice, more loot here.

4319
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:30,580
I can't up-gain my perk!

4320
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,400
What is this?

4321
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:35,540
I wanna check if there's people here.

4322
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:38,220
I think they're gone.

4323
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:39,860
We can stay here.

4324
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:40,460
We can stay here.

4325
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,760
I don't wanna go inside.

4326
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:43,780
Oh, me too.

4327
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:45,140
I don't wanna go inside.

4328
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:45,740
Yeah, me too.

4329
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:48,920
Let's look for people.

4330
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:50,780
Okay.

4331
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:52,100
I'm gonna craft a bat.

4332
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:56,620
Anyone need that?

4333
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:58,560
No, I don't think so.

4334
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,600
It's in this box.

4335
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:02,040
Kraber!

4336
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:02,980
Who wants the Kraber?

4337
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:03,640
Oh!

4338
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,040
That's pretty far.

4339
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:09,040
No, it's like right next to us.

4340
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:10,620
Actually, yeah, never mind.

4341
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:10,980
It is.

4342
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,400
It's like right here.

4343
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:13,620
Okay.

4344
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:17,220
But, I don't know, it might be too dangerous because it's in the middle.

4345
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:18,720
Okay.

4346
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:21,140
I mean, I can try and get it.

4347
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:21,960
I'll try and get it.

4348
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,440
I'll drop my... I'll drop my power for it.

4349
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,480
Okay.

4350
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:28,580
I will look a lot if there's...

4351
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:30,340
Make sure I don't die.

4352
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:31,940
Yeah.

4353
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,120
Okay, who wants the Kraber?

4354
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:36,080
I don't.

4355
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,200
I don't use Kraber.

4356
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:38,680
Utyl, do you want Kraber or no?

4357
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:39,700
No.

4358
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:40,580
No, no, no.

4359
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:40,940
No?

4360
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,440
No?

4361
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:41,500
Why?

4362
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:42,180
Why?

4363
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:46,460
I love my nemesis.

4364
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:47,420
Over here?

4365
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,220
They're far, they're far, they're far, they're far.

4366
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:49,840
I'm fine.

4367
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:52,260
I'm covering you.

4368
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,060
Yeah, it's fine.

4369
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:53,620
I cracked him.

4370
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:55,800
There's a bow check right here.

4371
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:56,440
I'm good, I'm good.

4372
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,240
Two blue, two blue, two blue there.

4373
02:00:59,160 --> 02:00:59,780
I'm okay.

4374
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,920
I will keep this place.

4375
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:03,980
This place is pretty good.

4376
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:05,160
Okay.

4377
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:08,820
I will make sure if there's no one come from our right side.

4378
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:09,820
Yeah.

4379
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:11,500
They're here.

4380
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:14,020
No one, no one, no one.

4381
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:15,620
Our right side, no one.

4382
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:17,980
There's people fighting...

4383
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:19,900
Yeah, there's people fighting.

4384
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:21,320
I'm looking.

4385
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:23,620
I'm reading.

4386
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:26,280
Maybe I can quell.

4387
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:27,740
Yeah, I think so too.

4388
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:28,620
There's a team right here.

4389
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:29,900
Oh, there's a guy right here in front of me.

4390
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:30,940
Okay.

02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:32,180
He's right here.

Okay.

Just try and roll down.

4395
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,180
Come on, he's like sliding.

4396
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:43,980
Oh my god, there's someone come, someone come here.

4397

4401
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:55,160
Okay.

4402
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:55,920
What the fuck?

4403
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:58,940
Okay, I don't think...

4404
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,400
Guys, I should not have Kraber.

4405
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,660
I shouldn't have Kraber.

4406
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:03,720
Guys...

4407
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:05,220
Hey!

4408
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:08,020
Guys...

4409
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:10,860
Someone take this Kraber off me.

4410
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,380
One guy, one guy.

4411
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:17,440
Someone take this Kraber off me.

4412
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:19,300

4413
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:20,980
There's a guy here.

02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,140
Please, take it.

4415
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:25,080
You use this.

4416
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,740
No, no, no.

4417
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:28,320
No Kraber for me.

4418
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,400
Wait, where's the Pathfinder?

4419
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:30,960
Oh.

4420
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:32,480
Yeah, there was...

4421
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:35,300
Oh shit, look at that Collat.

4422
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:37,000
Nice, nice.

4423
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:38,280
Okay.

4424
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:40,880
We have to take this hop.

4425
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:42,760
Oh, nice.

4426
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:43,640
Nice.

4427
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:48,060
Where the fuck is that Pathfinder though?

4428
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:48,960
Inside.

4429
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:50,560
One knock, one knock.

4430
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:51,160
One knock?

4431
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:51,460
Okay.

4432
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,280
I don't know, we should...

4433
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:53,740
I finished him.

4434
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:58,660
I'm so scared of the Pathfinder behind me.

4435
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:00,400
Okay, nice.

4436
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:02,880
Uhh...

4437
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,860
Let's see, I have five bullets left.

4438
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:10,820
I hit like three of those bullets.

4439
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:11,920
Uhh...

4440
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,940
Let's see, is there a Pathfinder behind me?

4441
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:18,140
Let's see, is there a Pathfinder behind me?

4442
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,420
Is there a Pathfinder behind me?

4443
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:26,940
Oh, careful.

4444
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,200
Oh, Pathfinder, Pathfinder here.

4445
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,120
Oh wait, he's on me.

4446
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:32,020
Behind the rock, behind the rock.

4447
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:33,980
Dead.

4448
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:37,040
Nice.

4449
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:40,540
Nice, nice, nice.

4450
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,200
Nice.

4451
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,680
Only two teams left.

4452
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,480
One team duo and full party.

4453
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,720
Full team there.

4454
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:46,260
Yeah.

4455
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:49,460
On my right.

4456
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:51,060
I'm gonna...

4457
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,420
I'm gonna come to you guys.

4458
02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:54,040
Oh!

4459
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:57,040
Is it down?

4460
02:03:58,920 --> 02:03:59,420
Woah.

4461
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,600
Oh my god, I stuck in the door.

4462
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:03,660
I'm gonna heal.

4463
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:06,660
Let me just...

4464
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:09,920
I couldn't swap my guns.

4465
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:12,000
Where are they again?

4466
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:13,260
Uhh, up top.

4467
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:13,740
High ground.

4468
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:14,440
High ground.

4469
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:16,040
One's high ground.

4470
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:20,400
High ground, okay.

4471
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:20,960
High ground, okay.

4472
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:25,560
Okay, I'm here.

4473
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,100
140?

4474
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:28,740
He's not gonna peek now.

4475
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:30,220
No!

4476
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:31,480
My door!

4477
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:33,980
Maybe we can play...

4478
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:34,540
here.

4479
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:37,440
I just don't wanna be in the middle.

4480
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,220
Okay, okay.

4481
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:40,800
As long as we're not in the middle, we're fine.

4482
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:41,960
We can go later.

4483
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:45,540
Is that one rat?

4484
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:46,140
Is that a rat?

4485
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:48,780
No, it's four teams.

4486
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:49,620
Oh, okay, okay.

4487
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:51,780
Four teams and one team duo.

4488
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:53,360
Okay.

4489
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:54,320
Oh, they knocked that one!

4490
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:54,660
Knocked one.

4491
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,940
One to 12, Karthus!

4492
02:04:58,980 --> 02:04:59,400
Oh, nice one!

4493
02:04:59,520 --> 02:04:59,880
Nice one!

4494
02:04:59,980 --> 02:05:01,080
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

4495
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,020
I want...

4496
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:04,540
I can't.

4497
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:05,160
I'm thirsty.

4498
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:05,660
Knocked one!

4499
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:06,160
Knocked one!

4500
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:09,820
I'm healing.

4501
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:10,460
Only two.

4502
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:11,260
Careful, careful.

4503
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:11,720
Inside.

4504
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:12,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4505
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,020
On me?

4506
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:17,620
Give me a Q.

4507
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:20,800
Burning one?

4508
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:21,240
Burning one?

4509
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:24,380
I'll kick him.

4510
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:25,140
Okay.

4511
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:31,180
Jesus Christ.

4512
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:31,580
Oh, no!

4513
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,380
Come here, come here.

4514
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:33,680
Just cover.

4515
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:36,480
Come here, just come here.

4516
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:37,180
Come to me.

4517
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:38,300
High ground, high ground.

4518
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,340
Come to me, come to me.

4519
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:42,360
I don't think we should...

4520
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:44,780
I don't think we should fight this now.

4521
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:45,460
We should wait.

4522
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:46,320
No, no, only...

4523
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,320
There are two teams.

4524
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:49,740
Yeah, but...

4525
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:52,620
They're resing.

4526
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:53,540
Oh, they're resing too.

4527
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,160
They're resing.

4528
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:55,480
They're resing.

4529
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:56,160
They're resing.

4530
02:05:58,260 --> 02:05:59,500
You can rest me here.

4531
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,620
I'm trying to cover.

4532
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:01,960
I'm covering.

4533
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:06,600
He's looking at me.

4534
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:08,160
Oh, no.

4535
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:09,000
Keep crawling.

4536
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:09,860
Keep crawling to me.

4537
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:10,180
Keep crawling.

4538
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:11,480
Okay, yeah, yeah.

4539
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:12,560
You're fighting.

4540
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:13,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4541
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:13,800
That's why I'm chilling.

4542
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:15,020
Just crawl, just crawl.

4543
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:16,900
I'm resing.

4544
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,260
I'm resing.

4545
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:17,940
You heal.

4546
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:18,220
You heal.

4547
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:18,620
I res.

4548
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:30,280
Do you have Q?

4549
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:30,660
Do you have Q?

4550
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:31,420
Oh, you used Q.

4551
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:31,700
Okay.

4552
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:33,740
I'm batting.

4553
02:06:33,740 --> 02:06:34,300
I'm batting.

4554
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:35,340
I'm batting.

4555
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:35,960
I'm batting too.

4556
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:36,300
Careful, Uto.

4557
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:37,220
Drop, drop, drop.

4558
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:39,640
Leave, leave behind me.

4559
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,760
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

4560
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:44,240
Oh, fuck.

4561
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:44,640
I'll give you Q.

4562
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:47,760
Q, Q, Q, Q.

4563
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:49,260
Oh, no.

4564
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:49,780
I don't have Q.

4565
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:50,080
I don't have Q.

4566
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:53,760
I'm healing.

4567
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:55,680
I'm healing.

4568
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:56,500
I'm healing.

4569
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:57,400
Full heal, full heal, full heal.

4570
02:06:59,100 --> 02:06:59,780
They're resing too.

4571
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:01,120
I can revive.

4572
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:01,640
I can revive.

4573
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:03,700
Just res.

4574
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:04,020
You res.

4575
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:04,340
You res.

4576
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:04,840
You res.

4577
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:05,220
Okay.

4578
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:06,500
Oh, my god.

4579
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:07,740
Give me Q.

4580
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:08,240
Give me Q.

4581
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:09,640
Okay, okay, okay.

4582
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:12,700
Where are they?

4583
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:13,960
Above, above, above.

4584
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:15,380
I'm fine.

4585
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:15,660
I'm fine.

4586
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,060
I'm batting.

4587
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:16,780
Full heal.

4588
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:17,120
Full heal.

4589
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:20,980
It's 2-2-2.

4590
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,020
2-2-3.

4591
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:22,540
2-2-3.

4592
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:24,200
Okay, 2-2-3.

4593
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:25,340
Yeah, yeah, careful.

4594
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:28,880
I have one Kraber shot.

4595
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:29,880
Oh, my god.

4596
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:31,040
This fucking team.

4597
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,540
Not the bat.

4598
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:34,560
I have no bat.

4599
02:07:35,820 --> 02:07:36,540
Of course.

4600
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:37,360
Can I just try it again?

4601
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,080
Okay, it's 3-3-2.

4602
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:40,700
3-3-2.

4603
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:47,360
I'm waiting.

4604
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:50,540
Just wait.

4605
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:50,900
Just wait.

4606
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:51,220
Just wait.

4607
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:51,800
Chill.

4608
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:52,400
Okay.

4609
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:53,120
Okay.

4610
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:56,120
Okay, okay.

4611
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,120
I hope I got that.

4612
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:57,620
I got that.

4613
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:01,740
When do you have Q?

4614
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:02,220
When do you have Q?

4615
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:03,340
Me.

4616
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:04,000
Yeah, now.

4617
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:04,260
Now.

4618
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:04,440
Now.

4619
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:04,980
Okay.

4620
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:05,680
Give me.

4621
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:07,120
Okay.

4622
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:08,680
Give me Q.

4623
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4624
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:10,500
I give you.

4625
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:10,900
I give you.

4626
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:12,460
Flash, flash, flash.

4627
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:15,380
Nice.

4628
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:16,660
Armor swap.

4629
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:16,960
You have to.

4630
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:18,860
Can I?

4631
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:19,120
Can I?

4632
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:19,440
Can I?

4633
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:20,880
Oh, no.

4634
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:23,760
I'm dead here.

4635
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,380
I don't have Q.

4636
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:26,660
I couldn't.

4637
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,120
I had only one gun left.

4638
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,360
We're so close.

4639
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:32,080
We're so close.

4640
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,980
I had one gun.

4641
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:35,900
I had one gun.

4642
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:41,180
There was like three times.

4643
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:42,060
Yeah.

4644
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:43,920
That's you.

4645
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:45,380
Oh, my god.

4646
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:47,040
I had another gun.

4647
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,560
If I had another gun.

4648
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:51,720
It was so close.

4649
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,740
We almost got champion.

4650
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:55,880
Oh, my god.

4651
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:58,440
I should help.

4652
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,960
I should help finish them.

4653
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:02,940
No.

4654
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,820
They had hammerpoint.

4655
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,980
We were so close.

4656
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:10,420
Where is he finding hammerpoint?

4657
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:13,280
Okay.

4658
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:14,040
I'm gonna be right back.

4659
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:14,660
I'm gonna use bathroom.

4660
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:15,840
Okay.

4661
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:16,200
Okay.

4662
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:18,640
Champion.

4663
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:19,200
Champion.

4664
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:21,000
That was close.

4665
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:22,280
That was close.

4666
02:09:27,350 --> 02:09:28,870
That was close.

4667
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:29,550
That was close.

4668
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:28,210
I'm back.

4669
02:10:28,530 --> 02:10:29,570
I'm back.

4670
02:10:29,570 --> 02:10:30,010
Okay.

4671
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:31,650
Same team.

4672
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:36,450
I bet you we can get champion if I find hammerpoint.

4673
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:37,610
Okay.

4674
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,290
Okay.

4675
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:42,770
I just need hammerpoint.

4676
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:43,870
We were so close.

4677
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:45,790
Only hammerpoint.

4678
02:10:45,790 --> 02:10:46,350
Yeah.

4679
02:10:50,070 --> 02:10:50,630
Okay.

4680
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:55,230
That was so close.

4681
02:10:55,450 --> 02:10:56,890
We were so close.

4682
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:59,030
I can't believe.

4683
02:10:59,570 --> 02:11:03,210
I can't believe they rez'd three times.

4684
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:04,190
They didn't push them.

4685
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:07,050
They didn't push them.

4686
02:11:07,410 --> 02:11:08,950
We didn't have DGI there too.

4687
02:11:09,790 --> 02:11:10,770
Do you have a team?

4688
02:11:11,170 --> 02:11:12,170
Yeah, they have a team.

4689
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:12,410
One party.

4690
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:13,370
One party.

4691
02:11:13,470 --> 02:11:13,750
One party.

4692
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:17,650
They're friend of me.

4693
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:22,570
Oh my god.

4694
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:25,750
Oh my god.

4695
02:11:26,210 --> 02:11:26,690
Oh my god.

4696
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:29,710
I got car and ulti.

4697
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:31,970
I got car and ulti.

4698
02:11:34,630 --> 02:11:38,290
I got car and Spitfire.

4699
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:40,250
I got left side.

4700
02:11:40,390 --> 02:11:40,590
I got left side.

4701
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:44,490
I'll look at my side.

4702
02:11:44,650 --> 02:11:45,310
Just to be sure.

4703
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:50,940
They're coming over.

4704
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:52,500
I see them.

4705
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:54,300
Careful.

4706
02:11:59,120 --> 02:11:59,780
Oh, zero.

4707
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:01,560
Two.

4708
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:01,840
Two.

4709
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:02,140
Two.

4710
02:12:02,140 --> 02:12:02,640
Two of them.

4711
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:03,920
I'm heading over.

4712
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:08,240
So close.

4713
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:08,580
So close.

4714
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:09,700
They're inside.

4715
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:12,160
Yeah, all three.

4716
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:12,720
I'm coming over.

4717
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:14,480
They're all three on you.

4718
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:15,020
All three on you.

4719
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:15,500
One crack.

4720
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:17,880
I'm coming over.

4721
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:18,500
Oh no.

4722
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:19,180
So close.

4723
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:19,500
So close.

4724
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:20,120
Careful.

4725
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:20,780
So close.

4726
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:23,900
Oh my god.

4727
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:24,800
He missed me so hard.

4728
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:24,920
Careful.

4729
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:25,320
Careful.

4730
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:27,180
I'm trying to help you.

4731
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:29,240
Flush.

4732
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,000
One down.

4733
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:30,320
Nice.

4734
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:30,740
One down.

4735
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:31,660
They're pushing.

4736
02:12:31,780 --> 02:12:31,960
They're pushing.

4737
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:33,860
Flush.

4738
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:36,920
Oh no.

4739
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:37,760
They're low.

4740
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:38,920
Two low.

4741
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,280
Two low.

4742
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:42,860
I'm healing.

4743
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:43,420
Healing.

4744
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:44,920
Where?

4745
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:45,680
No armor.

4746
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:45,840
No armor.

4747
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:47,440
Where did they go?

4748
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:55,480
That was bad for me.

4749
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:56,320
Oh.

4750
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:58,260
He had the Q.

4751
02:12:58,740 --> 02:12:59,060
Oh nice.

4752
02:12:59,240 --> 02:12:59,780
Oh.

4753
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:02,260
They push you guys so fast.

4754
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:03,180
Yeah.

4755
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:03,740
Yeah.

4756
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:05,180
They push you.

4757
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:06,220
That's so unlucky.

4758
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:07,660
Oh.

4759
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:08,520
If I push...

4760
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:10,340
I didn't...

4761
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:12,260
I didn't think they would push so fast.

4762
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:14,300
I was too slow behind.

4763
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:15,680
I was still running.

4764
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:17,820
Nice job.

4765
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:20,540
Nice try.

4766
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:21,360
Nice try.

4767
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:21,360
Okay.

4768
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:21,760
Okay.

4769
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:22,680
That doesn't count.

4770
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:23,620
That game doesn't count.

4771
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:27,360
We don't have hammer point.

4772
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:27,780
Yeah.

4773
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:28,100
Yeah.

4774
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:28,340
Yeah.

4775
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:28,540
Yeah.

4776
02:13:28,540 --> 02:13:29,380
We lost.

4777
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:30,960
Because no hammer point.

4778
02:13:31,570 --> 02:13:32,720
Every time we lose.

4779
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:34,660
No hammer point.

4780
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:36,000
Okay.

4781
02:13:36,020 --> 02:13:36,260
Okay.

4782
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:39,240
That's the only reason why we lose.

4783
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:43,880
Hammer point win.

4784
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:45,020
Yeah.

4785
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:45,140
Yeah.

4786
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:47,060
Fine hammer point equals win.

4787
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:47,860
Exactly.

4788
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:48,420
Okay.

4789
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:48,780
Okay.

4790
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:53,950
We can do it.

4791
02:13:53,950 --> 02:13:54,770
I believe in us.

4792
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:56,590
Yeah.

4793
02:13:56,830 --> 02:13:57,310
Look.

4794
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:59,170
Everyone in gold right now.

4795
02:13:59,190 --> 02:14:00,710
They are like master players.

4796
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:01,770
Masters plus.

4797
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:02,210
Okay?

4798
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:05,510
No.

4799
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:06,490
But we are paid.

4800
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:07,150
We are paid.

4801
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:07,730
Yeah.

4802
02:14:07,870 --> 02:14:08,110
Yeah.

4803
02:14:08,150 --> 02:14:08,330
Yeah.

4804
02:14:08,330 --> 02:14:08,690
Exactly.

4805
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:10,310
But like...

4806
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:10,630
You know.

4807
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:11,830
We are...

4808
02:14:11,830 --> 02:14:14,110
Our ping is like 500 ping.

4809
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:14,410
Remember?

4810
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:15,350
Oh.

4811
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:15,750
Oh.

4812
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:15,870
Yeah.

4813
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:16,350
I forgot.

4814
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:16,950
Yeah.

4815
02:14:18,710 --> 02:14:20,910
And they are fighting hammer points.

4816
02:14:21,230 --> 02:14:21,630
How?

4817
02:14:22,130 --> 02:14:22,530
Okay.

4818
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:23,970
What the fuck?

4819
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:24,530
They are all gold.

4820
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:30,980
Alright.

4821
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:31,780
You know what?

4822
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:32,940
Where do we go?

4823
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:33,800
We go here.

4824
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,000
Okay.

4825
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:35,420
Hot drop.

4826
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:35,900
Okay.

4827
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:36,980
I believe in us.

4828
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:37,740
Wow.

4829
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:38,360
Two.

4830
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:39,280
Two?

4831
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:39,820
Two teams?

4832
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:40,600
Two.

4833
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:41,080
Two.

4834
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:41,360
Two.

4835
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:41,880
Two teams.

4836
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:43,220
What the fuck is wrong with them?

4837
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:45,960
Maybe they like us.

4838
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:48,760
Oh.

4839
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:48,920
Two.

4840
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:49,680
The... The...

4841
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:50,880
What is that?

4842
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:51,700
Is that the melee?

4843
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:53,080
Is it?

4844
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:55,280
If it's not, it's third party.

4845
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:55,560
Oh.

4846
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:55,900
Okay.

4847
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,200
Good.

4848
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:56,300
Good.

4849
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:56,740
Good for us.

4850
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,180
Good for us.

4851
02:14:58,240 --> 02:14:58,860
Got a gun.

4852
02:14:58,960 --> 02:14:59,640
I got a gun.

4853
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:00,160
I got a gun.

4854
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:00,880
Alright.

4855
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:01,800
Are we gonna go?

4856
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:02,260
I'm going over.

4857
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:02,520
Yeah.

4858
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:02,800
Yeah.

4859
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:03,020
Yeah.

4860
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:03,360
Yeah.

4861
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:04,100
One down.

4862
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:04,660
One down.

4863
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:05,000
One down.

4864
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:05,160
Yeah.

4865
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:05,540
Yeah.

4866
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,000
Yeah.

4867
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:06,180
Yeah.

4868
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:07,980
I'm going over.

4869
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:08,520
Go.

4870
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:08,740
Go.

4871
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:08,940
Go.

4872
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:09,260
Go.

4873
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:09,460
Go.

4874
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:09,700
Go.

4875
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:09,820
Go.

4876
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:09,940
Go.

4877
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:10,380
I'm going.

4878
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:10,700
I'm going.

4879
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:11,060
I'm going.

4880
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:12,760
What the fuck?

4881
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:15,020
It's okay.

4882
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:15,580
You are strong.

4883
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:15,580
I'm going.

4884
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:16,720
Go.

4885
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:18,900
I believe.

4886
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:19,200
I believe.

4887
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:21,900
Come here.

4888
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:22,720
Oh wait.

4889
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:23,420
No wait.

4890
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:24,280
Okay.

4891
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:24,940
I want a scan.

4892
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:26,060
Yeah.

4893
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:26,260
Yeah.

4894
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:27,080
Scan.

4895
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:28,180
Scan.

4896
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,100
They are resing?

4897
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:32,720
I can't reach.

4898
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,120
Something...

4899
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:39,040
I think they res.

4900
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:39,440
They res.

4901
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:40,140
I think... Wait.

4902
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:40,340
Wait.

4903
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:40,640
Just wait.

4904
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:41,560
Oh.

4905
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:41,800
Nice.

4906
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:42,100
Okay.

4907
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:42,680
I knocked one.

4908
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:43,060
Okay.

4909
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:43,740
Yup.

4910
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:44,080
Nice.

4911
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:45,120
On my fourth.

4912
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:47,540
Oh.

4913
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:47,940
Wait.

4914
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:48,620
Where are they?

4915
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:50,880
Two.

4916
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:51,400
Two here.

4917
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:51,540
Two.

4918
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:51,800
Two.

4919
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:51,820
Two here.

4920
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:51,820
Two.

4921
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:51,820
Oh.

4922
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:52,560
Come here.

4923
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:52,700
Here.

4924
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:52,900
Photo.

4925
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:54,580
Two here.

4926
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:55,620
Oh no.

4927
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:56,340
I'm coming here.

4928
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:56,600
No.

4929
02:15:58,080 --> 02:15:58,520
Two.

4930
02:15:58,520 --> 02:15:58,960
Crack.

4931
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:00,500
Horizon crack.

4932
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:00,740
No.

4933
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:01,240
Wait.

4934
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:01,920
Where is the other team?

4935
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,120
Horizon crack.

4936
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:04,120
No.

4937
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:04,120
Wait.

4938
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:04,120
Where is the other team?

4939
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:04,560
They ran away.

4940
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:06,100
They ran away?

4941
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:06,700
Really?

4942
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:07,720
What?

4943
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:10,000
Why?

4944
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:12,360
Oh my god.

4945
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:13,060
I thought.

4946
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:14,380
Where is the other team?

4947
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:15,260
Where?

4948
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:16,640
Yeah.

4949
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:17,960
I'm watching the runway.

4950
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,880
Where did the other team go?

4951
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:21,960
What?

4952
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:23,800
What?

4953
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:25,180
How dare they?

4954
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:26,900
I won't report them.

4955
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:30,340
I can't believe it.

4956
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:33,460
What's the point of third partying if we can't third party?

4957
02:16:36,260 --> 02:16:36,860
What?

4958
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:38,260
They...

4959
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:40,020
They were there but...

4960
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:40,620
Okay.

4961
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:41,020
They...

4962
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:43,460
I bet they were walling.

4963
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:44,000
I bet.

4964
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:45,720
They knew.

4965
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:48,420
I bet they were walling.

4966
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:49,400
Where did they die?

4967
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:50,560
Oh.

4968
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:53,380
I lied into two people.

4969
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,120
Okay.

4970
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:54,800
Anyway.

4971
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:57,280
The only reason why we died is because we don't have hammerpoint.

4972
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:58,320
Oh.

4973
02:16:58,340 --> 02:16:58,440
Anyway.

4974
02:16:58,440 --> 02:16:58,440
The only reason why we died is because we don't have hammerpoint.

4975
02:16:58,440 --> 02:16:58,440
Oh.

4976
02:16:58,440 --> 02:16:58,460
Yes.

4977
02:16:58,820 --> 02:16:59,280
Yeah.

4978
02:16:59,360 --> 02:16:59,720
Two.

4979
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:00,520
Two.

4980
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:00,980
Two.

4981
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:02,660
Yeah.

4982
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:03,720
I can't believe it.

4983
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:04,760
So mean.

4984
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:05,740
They're so mean.

4985
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:06,960
They won't let us third party.

4986
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:12,960
So mean.

4987
02:17:12,980 --> 02:17:13,480
So mean.

4988
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:14,600
I know.

4989
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,520
They're so mean.

4990
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:20,320
Yeah.

4991
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:21,440
I'm gonna report them.

4992
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:22,620
Whoever they are.

4993
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,420
Can't believe it.

4994
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:30,320
Those fucks.

4995
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:37,600
Okay.

4996
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:39,640
This time I will be more careful.

4997
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:42,040
I believe in us.

4998
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:43,300
Yeah.

4999
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,020
I believe in us.

5000
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:51,230
Calm down.

5001
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:55,410
I went the wrong way.

5002
02:17:56,090 --> 02:17:57,270
I went the wrong way.

5003
02:17:59,410 --> 02:17:59,970
Oh.

5004
02:18:00,110 --> 02:18:01,210
No one calmed down.

5005
02:18:01,290 --> 02:18:01,550
Oh.

5006
02:18:01,550 --> 02:18:01,550
No one calmed down.

5007
02:18:01,550 --> 02:18:04,730
I heard you say, I heard you say, I heard you say, I didn't calms down.

5008
02:18:07,310 --> 02:18:08,770
I didn't calms down.

5009
02:18:12,030 --> 02:18:13,390
I just hear down.

5010
02:18:14,010 --> 02:18:15,350
Is there anyone here on us?

5011
02:18:15,510 --> 02:18:15,810
Oh.

5012
02:18:16,510 --> 02:18:17,590
One team.

5013
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:18,390
Oh.

5014
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:19,530
No.

5015
02:18:19,670 --> 02:18:19,890
No.

5016
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:20,110
No.

5017
02:18:20,110 --> 02:18:20,650
Oh.

5018
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:22,290
Liar.

5019
02:18:22,790 --> 02:18:23,390
No.

5020
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:24,830
I saw.

5021
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:27,890
I saw someone above us.

5022
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:29,130
I saw someone above us.

5023
02:18:29,130 --> 02:18:29,190
Whoa.

5024
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:30,270
The server is.

5025
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:30,750
Yeah.

5026
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:32,130
Watch your backpack.

5027
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:33,670
Yeah.

5028
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:34,270
Like that.

5029
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:37,710
A car.

5030
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:41,350
I feel so sad.

5031
02:18:41,490 --> 02:18:43,290
The R9 is so garbage.

5032
02:18:44,770 --> 02:18:48,350
R9 is so bad now.

5033
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:50,030
Not that good.

5034
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:52,910
Not that good.

5035
02:18:52,910 --> 02:18:54,850
Why is the R9 so bad?

5036
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:55,850
Why is the R9 so bad?

5037
02:18:58,130 --> 02:19:00,850
I want them to buff R9 back.

5038
02:19:01,170 --> 02:19:01,290
I want them to buff R9 back.

5039
02:19:01,290 --> 02:19:01,610
Me too.

5040
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:07,570
I feel so fucking weak.

5041
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:07,890
I feel so fucking weak.

5042
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:08,910
You can't escape.

5043
02:19:09,710 --> 02:19:10,750
You're so weak.

5044
02:19:11,030 --> 02:19:11,630
Yeah.

5045
02:19:12,210 --> 02:19:13,630
I'm not gonna cough.

5046
02:19:13,890 --> 02:19:16,270
I will keep it.

5047
02:19:18,630 --> 02:19:20,010
I'm not gonna cough.

5048
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:20,010
I will keep it.

5049
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:20,490
I forgot you.

5050
02:19:22,470 --> 02:19:23,510
You're like...

5051
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:23,910
Oh.

5052
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:24,230
Oh.

5053
02:19:24,290 --> 02:19:24,490
Oh.

5054
02:19:24,490 --> 02:19:25,250
I want you to buff R9 back.

5055
02:19:26,210 --> 02:19:26,770
Thank you.

5056
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:28,030
Cool.

5057
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:29,690
I got a... I got a key.

5058
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:31,030
Let me know if you guys find a backpack.

5059
02:19:31,390 --> 02:19:32,470
I have no backpacks.

5060
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:33,750
Backpack?

5061
02:19:34,050 --> 02:19:34,570

5062
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:35,210

5063
02:19:35,210 --> 02:19:35,530

5064
02:19:36,670 --> 02:19:38,150
Two backpack there.

5065
02:19:38,410 --> 02:19:38,810

5067
02:19:39,490 --> 02:19:39,870

5071
02:19:48,210 --> 02:19:48,730

5072
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:49,250
Okay.

5074
02:19:49,990 --> 02:19:49,990
Okay.

5075
02:19:49,990 --> 02:19:49,990

5076
02:19:49,990 --> 02:19:55,630
I got a 30-30 and a...

5077
02:19:55,630 --> 02:19:57,370
I have a 30-30 and a R9.

5078
02:19:59,790 --> 02:20:00,910
I have...

5079
02:20:04,090 --> 02:20:04,650
Backpack.

5080
02:20:07,330 --> 02:20:09,390
Why is it so hard to find?

5081
02:20:10,410 --> 02:20:11,850
Have you guys ever seen one?

5082
02:20:12,030 --> 02:20:12,210
Yeah.

5083
02:20:12,330 --> 02:20:13,190
Did you guys ever...

5084
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:14,970
Have you guys seen one at all?

5085
02:20:15,350 --> 02:20:16,470
Two times.

5086
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:17,430
Two times?

5087
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:18,190
Yeah.

5088
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:18,590
Two times.

5089
02:20:18,830 --> 02:20:19,390
Like in your life?

5090
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:20,430
Yeah.

5091
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:20,650
Yeah.

5092
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:21,790
In my life.

5093
02:20:22,770 --> 02:20:23,890
What the fuck?

5094
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:28,750
What is the spawn rate of that stupid attachment?

5095
02:20:29,490 --> 02:20:29,810
What is the spawn rate of that stupid attachment?

5096
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:31,170
Maybe you have to go to the...

5097
02:20:32,450 --> 02:20:33,330
I thought...

5098
02:20:33,870 --> 02:20:34,090
Hudson?

5099
02:20:34,890 --> 02:20:36,910
If you go to Hudson...

5100
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:38,310
Oh, maybe.

5101
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:39,510
I have a key.

5102
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:39,970
Wait, wait.

5103
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:40,070
No.

5104
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:40,830
Maybe in the vault.

5105
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:41,810
I have a vault key.

5106
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:42,290
Oh, yeah.

5107
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:42,630
Yeah.

5108
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:42,950
Yes.

5109
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:43,250
Yes.

5110
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:43,570
Yes.

5111
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:46,370
In your whole life.

5112
02:20:49,570 --> 02:20:50,910
I mean, in your season.

5113
02:20:51,010 --> 02:20:51,630
In your season.

5114
02:20:51,730 --> 02:20:51,910
I mean...

5115
02:20:51,930 --> 02:20:53,450
I only see it two times.

5116
02:20:53,590 --> 02:20:56,010
I think I saw it like one time in the new season.

5117
02:20:56,970 --> 02:20:57,330
Alright.

5118
02:20:57,410 --> 02:20:57,990
Come on.

5119
02:20:58,210 --> 02:20:59,010
Hammer point.

5120
02:20:59,050 --> 02:20:59,890
Just a gold bag.

5121
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:01,570
Same as Turbo Shot.

5122
02:21:02,770 --> 02:21:03,330
Hammer.

5123
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:04,010
Hammer.

5124
02:21:04,010 --> 02:21:04,470
Hammer point.

5125
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:05,530
Hammer point.

5126
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:06,870
Hammer point.

5127
02:21:07,170 --> 02:21:07,790
Hammer point.

5128
02:21:08,730 --> 02:21:10,130
I took everything.

5129
02:21:11,010 --> 02:21:12,090
I took everything.

5130
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:12,890
I took everything.

5131
02:21:13,890 --> 02:21:15,010
Who wants to take that?

5132
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:16,570
Who's rezzing?

5133
02:21:16,650 --> 02:21:17,870
Do you need this?

5134
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:19,750
Okay.

5135
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:20,530
I will.

5136
02:21:20,730 --> 02:21:21,030
Okay.

5137
02:21:22,050 --> 02:21:23,350
I think you should have it.

5138
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:24,910
I think Conduit should have it.

5139
02:21:25,450 --> 02:21:26,670
The Q is better.

5140
02:21:27,390 --> 02:21:27,870
Okay.

5141
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:28,090
Okay.

5142
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:29,010
Ditto.

5143
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:30,230
Ditto.

5144
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:30,470
Ditto.

5145
02:21:33,010 --> 02:21:33,490
Yeah.

5146
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:34,270
Nice.

5147
02:21:39,410 --> 02:21:41,390
There's people fighting in Fragment.

5148
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:47,330
In Fragment?

5149
02:21:47,410 --> 02:21:47,610
Okay.

5150
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:47,870
Yeah.

5151
02:21:47,990 --> 02:21:48,050
Yeah.

5152
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:49,230
Oh my god.

5153
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:51,010
It got all gold.

5154
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:53,210
All gold.

5155
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:54,910
Go.

5156
02:21:55,290 --> 02:21:55,650
Go.

5157
02:21:56,630 --> 02:21:56,990
Go.

5158
02:21:57,210 --> 02:21:57,210
Go.

5159
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:00,850
Alright.

5160
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:02,230
I don't know where they...

5161
02:22:03,130 --> 02:22:03,490
Okay.

5162
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:04,550
Let's see first.

5163
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:08,350
Yeah.

5164
02:22:08,810 --> 02:22:09,590
They were here.

5165
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:11,110
There's a... Oh!

5166
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:11,610
I see them.

5167
02:22:12,450 --> 02:22:12,810
Wait.

5168
02:22:12,850 --> 02:22:13,010
Where?

5169
02:22:13,310 --> 02:22:13,470
Here?

5170
02:22:13,470 --> 02:22:13,590
Oh.

5171
02:22:13,630 --> 02:22:13,850
Wait.

5172
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:13,970
Oh.

5173
02:22:14,010 --> 02:22:14,130
Wait.

5174
02:22:14,130 --> 02:22:14,190
Oh.

5175
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:14,190
Wait.

5176
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:14,470
Oh.

5177
02:22:15,790 --> 02:22:16,770
Are they fighting?

5178
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:17,030
No?

5179
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:19,110
No.

5180
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:19,950
I think they finished.

5181
02:22:20,810 --> 02:22:21,150
Yeah.

5182
02:22:21,910 --> 02:22:22,870
And the meter?

5183
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:25,490
Do we want to fight or no?

5184
02:22:26,810 --> 02:22:27,330
Um...

5185
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:27,630
Uto.

5186
02:22:28,030 --> 02:22:28,550
Uto.

5187
02:22:28,890 --> 02:22:30,110
Do we fight or no?

5302
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:44,100
Wait, I'm getting shot from two angles!

5303
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:44,660
Two teams!

5304
02:24:46,220 --> 02:24:47,760

Two teams, two teams.

5311
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:56,520
We're going back out.

5312
02:24:56,580 --> 02:24:57,000

Goodbye!

5316
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:10,630
We can destruct her again!

5317
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:11,910
Okay, okay, okay.

Yeah, one has a wingman and I don't fuck with her.

02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:22,750
I don't fuck with that.

5323
02:25:23,790 --> 02:25:24,490
Okay, okay.

5324
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:26,090
The wingman is scary.

5325
02:25:26,330 --> 02:25:28,630
We can make, we can, we can craft her here.

5326
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:30,850
Okay, I'm gonna shin my gun.

5327
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:32,250

5328
02:25:33,570 --> 02:25:34,010
Okay.

5329
02:25:34,430 --> 02:25:35,210

Oh, I feel like this.

5341
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:52,890
We can build her stronger.

5342
02:26:00,350 --> 02:26:01,230
Alright, we're fine.

5343
02:26:01,410 --> 02:26:03,230

5346
02:26:07,050 --> 02:26:07,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5347
02:26:10,250 --> 02:26:11,770
We're so far from zone.

5348
02:26:11,850 --> 02:26:12,390
I don't have heals.

5349
02:26:13,470 --> 02:26:15,570

I'm pretty far from you.

5358
02:26:24,210 --> 02:26:25,710
Yeah, I'm just trying to see if I can...

5359
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:26,570

It was very bad.

5368
02:26:38,430 --> 02:26:39,650
Are you trying to finish them?

5369
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:40,910
Yeah, I finished this guy.

5370
02:26:41,070 --> 02:26:41,490
There's another.

5371
02:26:42,410 --> 02:26:44,530

02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:48,130
It's okay.

5374
02:26:48,410 --> 02:26:49,030
We need to go to zone.

5375
02:26:49,070 --> 02:26:49,630
We need to go to zone.

5376
02:26:49,790 --> 02:26:50,090
I don't want to fight you.

5377
02:26:50,810 --> 02:26:53,150
They're going to revive that guy.

5378

One minute.

5453
02:28:44,170 --> 02:28:44,970
One minute left.

One team, one team, they are fighting.

5466
02:29:04,750 --> 02:29:06,230
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

5467
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:07,330
Wait, what?

5468
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:09,290
I forgot.

5469
02:29:10,110 --> 02:29:11,110
Did you forget to heal?

5470
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:13,890
Okay, okay, okay.

5471
02:29:14,910 --> 02:29:17,350
I forgot to heal because I was yelling at your name.

5472
02:29:17,650 --> 02:29:17,690
Be careful, be careful.

5473
02:29:18,890 --> 02:29:20,610
Okay, okay, I have to heal, I have to heal too.

5474
02:29:21,130 --> 02:29:21,970
I have to go to zone.

5475
02:29:22,890 --> 02:29:23,670
Okay, I'm good.

5476
02:29:26,330 --> 02:29:29,430
Oh my god, the first time I've ever seen a hammerpoint.

5477
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:31,270
Nice.

5478
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:33,030

Finally got hammerpoint.

5480
02:29:34,310 --> 02:29:35,430
I finally did it, everybody.

5481
02:29:35,830 --> 02:29:37,150
We don't have much time.

5482
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:41,050
We have to go, we have to go.

5483
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:42,230
Maybe we can go from left side.

5484
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:42,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5485
02:29:43,370 --> 02:29:47,230
Okay, but I give you syringe.

5486
02:29:47,290 --> 02:29:48,650

I have nine, but I have only one syringe.

5494
02:30:04,390 --> 02:30:05,610
Someone has a Kraber.

5495
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:06,290
Careful.

5496
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:07,930

02:30:17,910 --> 02:30:19,090
Oh, the Kraber, Kraber, Kraber.

5503

5527
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:11,920
There's a guy right here, he's running back.

02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:13,940
Okay, I will go top.

5529

02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:28,400
Yeah, this guy is blue.

I think our spot is pretty good.

5542
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:37,680
Yeah, it is.

5543
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:38,360
We'll just stay here.

5544
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:39,160
I'm gonna loot.

5545
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,620
Is there like a 4x, like a 2x4?

There's shield cells too for us.

5549
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:53,760
I have too many batteries.

5550
02:31:53,940 --> 02:31:54,600
I don't need it.

5551
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:55,580
Me too.

5552
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:58,560
Fuck you.

That's right, you don't get rez.

Yeah.

5556
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:07,240
Okay.

5557
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:08,360
Behind the box.

5558
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:12,260
I don't have angle.

5559
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:14,760
Behind here too.

5560
02:32:19,370 --> 02:32:20,450
I'm safe right now.

5561
02:32:20,510 --> 02:32:21,130
I should be fine.

5562
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:21,590
Okay.

5563
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:22,550
Yeah.

5564
02:32:23,710 --> 02:32:25,130
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5565
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:27,290
I'm gonna make sure no one is behind us.

5566
02:32:27,910 --> 02:32:28,690
No rats.

5567
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,490
No rats?

5568
02:32:30,750 --> 02:32:31,230
Maybe.

5569
02:32:31,630 --> 02:32:32,090
Maybe.

5570
02:32:32,090 --> 02:32:33,330
I will check here.

5571
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:33,970
I'm checking right now.

5572
02:32:34,050 --> 02:32:34,530
No rats.

5573
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:36,450
No rats.

5574
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:38,370
Only cheap teams left.

5575
02:32:39,310 --> 02:32:42,190
There's a team here and then a team to our left.

5576
02:32:42,850 --> 02:32:44,310
And another team there.

5577
02:32:44,370 --> 02:32:45,470
One running, running, running.

5578
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:47,190
72?

5579
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:50,530
Oh, so long.

5580
02:32:52,030 --> 02:32:53,130
Got him, got him, got him.

5581
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:53,390
Nice, nice.

5582
02:32:53,970 --> 02:32:54,970
But we can push.

5583
02:32:55,250 --> 02:32:55,950
I can push.

5584
02:32:55,950 --> 02:32:56,390
I can push.

5585
02:32:57,230 --> 02:32:58,310
I can, I can, I can.

5586
02:32:59,450 --> 02:33:00,350
Can you cover me?

5587
02:33:00,410 --> 02:33:00,830
Can you cover me?

5588
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:01,930
Okay.

5589
02:33:07,690 --> 02:33:08,490
I thirsted him.

5590
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:10,670
Okay, over there.

5591
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:11,810
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

5592
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:13,550
Okay.

5593
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:15,430
We're fine.

5594
02:33:16,270 --> 02:33:17,690
That team is one person.

5595
02:33:17,770 --> 02:33:19,310
That team is a solo.

5596
02:33:20,450 --> 02:33:21,030
Team over here.

5597
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:21,810
Team over here.

5598
02:33:21,890 --> 02:33:22,590
Look, look, look, look.

5599
02:33:22,910 --> 02:33:24,690
They might come to us.

5600
02:33:24,910 --> 02:33:25,790
Look at this, look at this.

5601
02:33:28,350 --> 02:33:28,770
Cracked him.

5602
02:33:29,810 --> 02:33:30,670
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

5603
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:31,310
Oh my god.

5604
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,040
I'm in.

5605
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:38,940
Oh, nice.

5606
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:39,760
He has Kraber.

5607
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:41,940
Okay, okay.

5608
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:42,880
I'll give you kill.

5609
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:45,060
It's fine.

5610
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:45,360
I'm good.

5611
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:45,620
I'm good.

5612
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:46,360
I'm just stringing.

5613
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:47,680
Okay.

5614
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:50,800
I don't know where the second team is.

5615
02:33:53,660 --> 02:33:54,680
The second team.

5616
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:54,980
No.

5617
02:33:54,980 --> 02:33:55,700
Oh, wait.

5618
02:33:55,820 --> 02:33:56,640
Solo, solo three.

5619
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:57,180
Solo three.

5620
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:57,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5621
02:33:57,780 --> 02:33:58,580
This is a solo.

5622
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:00,260
Fuck off.

5623
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:01,200
You're solo.

5624
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:02,320
Get out of here.

5625
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:04,160
No, this is all cheap.

5626
02:34:04,480 --> 02:34:05,760
I think there's four teams.

5627
02:34:06,020 --> 02:34:06,400
No, no.

5628
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:06,880
I killed...

5629
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:07,800
I killed...

5630
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:09,620
Fuck off.

5631
02:34:10,780 --> 02:34:12,120
No, I killed one here.

5632
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:12,680
I killed one.

5633
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:13,680
He's a solo.

5634
02:34:14,380 --> 02:34:15,240
I'm coming over to you.

5635
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:17,040
They're gonna come to us.

5636
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:18,900
We have to focus that team first.

5637
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:19,540
Okay, I need...

5638
02:34:20,540 --> 02:34:20,940
Yeah.

5639
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:22,540
Come here.

5640
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:24,400
We're high ground though.

5641
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:24,980
We have high ground.

5642
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:25,580
So we're fine.

5643
02:34:25,700 --> 02:34:25,860
Yeah, yeah.

5644
02:34:26,180 --> 02:34:26,780
Okay, okay.

5645
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:29,160
And we also have hammer point.

5646
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:32,960
I feel like he has... Yeah, we have hammer point.

5647
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:34,420
If they come close to us, we have hammer point.

5648
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:38,180
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

5649
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:38,680
This guy.

5650
02:34:39,260 --> 02:34:39,620
Ah.

5651
02:34:44,360 --> 02:34:44,720
Nice.

5652
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:45,080
Nice.

5653
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:46,180
Nice.

5654
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:46,920
One down.

5655
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:48,280
I focused this team.

5656
02:34:48,480 --> 02:34:48,840
This...

5657
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:49,520
Yeah, yeah.

5658
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:49,880
This team.

5659
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:49,980
He's a solo.

5660
02:34:50,460 --> 02:34:51,280
Don't kill this solo.

5661
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:52,000
Don't kill this guy.

5662
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:52,540
He's a solo.

5663
02:34:53,460 --> 02:34:55,240
We want the solo to help us.

5664
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:00,220
One guy solo.

5665
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:02,400
Yeah, he didn't thirst him, right?

5666
02:35:03,140 --> 02:35:04,660
Oh, I don't have...

5667
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:05,880
Oh...

5668
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:07,980
I don't have angle.

5669
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:09,420
I don't have angle to kill them.

5670
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:12,420
I'm batting.

5671
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:12,780
I'm batting.

5672
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,400
Don't kill the solo below.

5673
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:17,620
We want him to help us.

5674
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:17,980
Okay.

5675
02:35:18,300 --> 02:35:19,280
Yeah, see?

5676
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:20,380
He's helping us.

5677
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:22,060
We want him to help us kill this team.

5678
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:24,640
Okay.

5679
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:27,400
There's our secure member.

5680
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:28,820
Yeah, he is our...

5681
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:29,660
He is our teammate.

5682
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:30,700
He is our fourth player.

5683
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:33,500
Ooh.

5684
02:35:34,420 --> 02:35:35,000
Kill him.

5685
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:35,300
Kill him.

5686
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:39,200
They want to kill the rat, but we won't let them.

5687
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:43,300
Look at how many heavy ammo do you have.

5688
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:43,440
Look at how many heavy ammo do you have.

5689
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:44,640
I have 178 here.

5690
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:45,440
I can get 58.

5691
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:46,260
I have 178 here.

5692
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:46,260
I can get 58.

5693
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:46,300
Okay.

5694
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:46,640
Okay.

5695
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:47,180
Thank you.

5696
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:51,060
Move back in.

02:35:51,060 --> 02:35:51,400
Nice.

5698
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:51,700
Move back in.

5699
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:51,700
Nice.

5700
02:35:55,580 --> 02:35:56,480
They have to run.

5701
02:35:56,540 --> 02:35:57,360
They have to run to us.

5702
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:02,960
Skyeong?

5703
02:36:03,820 --> 02:36:04,140

5707
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:06,220
Shoot.

5708
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:07,100
Shoot the people on this.

5709
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:10,120
I'm fine.

5710
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:10,460

5711
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:10,660

Oh, he's so low.

Oh, nice.

02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:48,020
I will ult them.

5754
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:52,540
Alright.

5755
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,060
2-2.

5756
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:54,100
It's actually 2 down there.

5757
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:54,420
It's 2.

5758
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:56,620
It's 2.

5759
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,340
What the fuck?

5760
02:36:59,580 --> 02:37:00,760
I thought it was 3.

5761
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:02,300
I thought it was 1 but it's 2.

5762
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:03,220
That's fine.

5763
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:07,420
What the fuck is wrong with them?

5764
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:08,820
What the fuck is wrong with them?

5765
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:09,860
It's the solo.

5766
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:11,460
Bro.

5767
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:13,060
Stop.

5768
02:37:14,420 --> 02:37:14,880
Can

5769
02:37:24,890 --> 02:37:25,370
we go there?

5770
02:37:25,590 --> 02:37:26,190
Can we go there?

5771
02:37:26,190 --> 02:37:26,610
Can we kill Jango?

5772
02:37:26,830 --> 02:37:28,610
Can we kill Jango?

5773
02:37:28,870 --> 02:37:29,330
Crack.

5774
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:29,630
Crack.

5775
02:37:29,630 --> 02:37:30,570
What the fuck, Crack?

5776
02:37:33,730 --> 02:37:34,190
Nice.

5777
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:34,270
Nice.

5778
02:37:48,990 --> 02:37:50,490
Oh my god.

5779
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:54,090
Oh my god.

5780
02:37:54,130 --> 02:37:54,910
I knew it.

5781
02:37:55,990 --> 02:37:56,910
Hammerpoint win.

5782
02:37:58,210 --> 02:38:00,590
I only used Hammerpoint once.

5783
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:03,730
That's fine.

5784
02:38:03,930 --> 02:38:04,470
That's fine.

5785
02:38:04,490 --> 02:38:05,050
Nice.

5786
02:38:06,230 --> 02:38:09,390
I only used it like one time but that's okay.

5787
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:10,170
We still won.

5788
02:38:10,750 --> 02:38:11,310
Yes.

5789
02:38:12,730 --> 02:38:13,550
That's good.

5790
02:38:13,690 --> 02:38:14,130
That's good.

5791
02:38:14,130 --> 02:38:15,370
I told you.

5792
02:38:15,450 --> 02:38:16,730
That's all we need.

5793
02:38:17,550 --> 02:38:18,810
That's all we need.

5794
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:20,230
We just needed Hammerpoint.

5795
02:38:24,150 --> 02:38:26,610
Every time we get Hammerpoint, it's a champion.

5796
02:38:27,570 --> 02:38:28,130
Yes.

5797
02:38:29,710 --> 02:38:31,910
I find you, Hammerpoint.

5798
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:32,230
Yeah.

5799
02:38:33,190 --> 02:38:34,310
It's like lucky.

5800
02:38:37,410 --> 02:38:39,390
We get lucky when we have it.

5801
02:38:39,650 --> 02:38:40,010
Yeah.

5802
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:40,350
Yeah.

5803
02:38:40,410 --> 02:38:40,690
Yeah.

5804
02:38:40,710 --> 02:38:41,510
You're right.

5805
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:44,450
We also have a good position too.

5806
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:48,910
I knew it.

5807
02:38:48,990 --> 02:38:49,790
I knew it.

5808
02:38:51,210 --> 02:38:52,350
It's all we need.

5809
02:38:55,170 --> 02:38:55,670
It's all we need.

5810
02:38:56,650 --> 02:38:57,210
Oh.

5811
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:58,430
So good.

5812
02:38:58,790 --> 02:38:59,410
Oh my god.

5813
02:38:59,450 --> 02:39:00,470
We weren't poor too.

5814
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:05,230
We weren't poor too.

5815
02:39:05,390 --> 02:39:05,590
No.

5816
02:39:05,650 --> 02:39:06,370
We're not poor.

5817
02:39:07,410 --> 02:39:07,970
No.

5818
02:39:08,010 --> 02:39:08,530
We're not poor.

5819
02:39:08,590 --> 02:39:08,790
Yeah.

5820
02:39:09,650 --> 02:39:10,210
Yeah.

5821
02:39:11,990 --> 02:39:14,010
I love it when we're not poor.

5822
02:39:14,270 --> 02:39:14,390
I love it when we're not poor.

5823
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:14,750
Me too.

5824
02:39:15,210 --> 02:39:15,930
Me too.

5825
02:39:16,210 --> 02:39:16,570
Me too.

5826
02:39:21,340 --> 02:39:21,940
That's us!

5827
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:23,480
Nice!

5828
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:24,660
Nice!

5829
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:26,340
That's us!

5830
02:39:28,420 --> 02:39:28,920
Nice!

5831
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:30,780
Auto, where?

5832
02:39:32,380 --> 02:39:32,940
Countdown.

5833
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:34,400
Countdown, yeah.

5834
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:35,900
Okay.

5835
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:36,240
Okay.

5836
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:39,220
Okay.

5837
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:39,520
Okay.

5838
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:39,940
Okay.

5839
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:40,660
Okay.

5840
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:45,320
Let me see.

5841
02:39:45,400 --> 02:39:46,520
I think no one...

5842
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:46,900
Wait.

5843
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:47,780
One team?

5844
02:39:47,940 --> 02:39:48,240
One team?

5845
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:48,680
Okay.

5846
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:49,340
I'm not sure.

5847
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:49,660
I'm not sure.

5848
02:39:51,440 --> 02:39:52,080
I'll look.

5849
02:39:53,460 --> 02:39:54,320
I'm gonna loot inside.

5850
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:54,960
Only one.

5851
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:56,120
One team?

5852
02:39:57,240 --> 02:39:57,680
No.

5853
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:58,280
No team.

5854
02:39:58,320 --> 02:39:58,620
No team.

5855
02:39:58,700 --> 02:39:58,700
No team?

5856
02:39:58,840 --> 02:39:59,040
Okay.

5857
02:39:59,220 --> 02:40:00,140
I'm looting inside.

5858
02:40:00,520 --> 02:40:03,580
There are like four teams in Skyhook.

5859
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:04,120
There are like four teams in Skyhook.

5860
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:04,120
Alright.

5861
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,240
We search Skyhook.

5862
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:06,320
Okay.

5863
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:10,320
You're a better gun.

5864
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:11,040
Skyhook.

5865
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:12,120
Skyhook.

5866
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:15,960
Oh.

5867
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:16,560
Well.

5868
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:19,000
Take that.

5869
02:40:23,490 --> 02:40:25,830
Are we gonna find Hemlock or...

5870
02:40:26,430 --> 02:40:27,090
Oh wait.

5871
02:40:27,090 --> 02:40:27,510
I found Hemlock.

5872
02:40:27,590 --> 02:40:27,870
Nevermind.

5873
02:40:28,650 --> 02:40:29,130
Nice.

5874
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:34,080
Oh.

5875
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:34,700
Yeah?

5876
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:35,740
I'll take that.

5877
02:40:37,740 --> 02:40:38,460
It is...

5878
02:40:38,460 --> 02:40:39,040
I don't have that.

5879
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:42,500
Oh.

5880
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:44,980
I found one too.

5881
02:40:45,160 --> 02:40:45,640
Nevermind.

5882
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:46,100
Yeah.

5883
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:48,260
Alright.

5884
02:40:48,260 --> 02:40:48,440
I'll go.

5885
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:50,880
Here's... if anyone wants that.

5886
02:40:56,800 --> 02:41:00,260
It might be...

5887
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:02,640
We did it.

5888
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:03,160
Yeah.

5889
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:03,360
Oh.

5890
02:41:03,440 --> 02:41:03,680
Pryler.

5891
02:41:05,360 --> 02:41:05,840
Oh.

5892
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:06,100
Nice.

5893
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:11,900
Oh.

5894
02:41:12,020 --> 02:41:12,260
Oh.

5895
02:41:12,260 --> 02:41:12,500
Okay.

5896
02:41:13,480 --> 02:41:14,280
You know what.

5897
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:18,660
30 30 was so nice to me.

5898
02:41:18,760 --> 02:41:19,780
I'm gonna take it again.

5899
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:22,640
Okay.

5900
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:26,800
Uto.

5901
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:27,380
Show me.

5902
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:28,100
Go.

5903
02:41:28,100 --> 02:41:28,200
Go.

5904
02:41:28,220 --> 02:41:28,480
Go.

5905
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:28,680
Go.

5906
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:31,660
4K damage.

5907
02:41:33,420 --> 02:41:34,300
Good luck!

5908
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:36,720
Pro!

5909
02:41:38,060 --> 02:41:39,220
Yeah, pro, remember.

5910
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:41,260
You can do it!

5911
02:41:41,780 --> 02:41:43,160
You are pro, right?

5912
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:43,920
Are you a liar?

5913
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:46,480
No, no, no.

5914
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:48,480
Wait, are we going to skyhook?

5915
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:52,120
4K.

5916
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:53,480
I believe.

5917
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:55,400
I have a key.

5918
02:41:56,260 --> 02:41:56,640
Oh, a key?

5919
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:57,660
Oh, okay.

5920
02:41:57,800 --> 02:41:58,380
Let's go key.

5921
02:41:58,620 --> 02:41:59,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5922
02:42:00,390 --> 02:42:01,580
Gotcha, gotcha.

5923
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:03,120
Okay, let's go.

5924
02:42:03,820 --> 02:42:07,600
Alright, let's go.

5925
02:42:09,640 --> 02:42:12,380
I will go take the armor.

5926
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:13,740
Alright.

5927
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:16,260
Oh yeah, the harvester?

5928
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:18,260
Yeah.

5929
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:22,340
Hammer point.

5930
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:23,400
Hammer point.

5931
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,580
Hammer point.

5932
02:42:28,860 --> 02:42:29,580
Whoa!

5933
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:31,040
Hammer point?

5934
02:42:34,340 --> 02:42:35,060
No.

5935
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:36,220
No?

5936
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:37,080
No.

5937
02:42:37,460 --> 02:42:38,180
No!

5938
02:42:40,300 --> 02:42:41,340
No hammer point?

5939
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:41,920
No.

5940
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:44,740
Wait, fight in front.

5941
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:45,800
I'm going to go.

5942
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:47,840
Okay, enemy.

5943
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:48,700
Yeah, enemy.

5944
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:51,700
I heard a grenade.

5945
02:42:53,440 --> 02:42:55,740

I will make our army.

5949
02:42:59,000 --> 02:42:59,920
I'm pretty far.

5950
02:43:00,020 --> 02:43:00,480
Be careful.

5951
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:02,100
Oh,

5952
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:06,670

I think we wait.

5955
02:43:08,150 --> 02:43:09,030
We wait, we wait.

5956
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:09,710
Wait for Ditto.

5957
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:12,670
Okay.

02:43:13,690 --> 02:43:15,150
And rez too.

5959
02:43:15,830 --> 02:43:17,230
Maybe they come to me.

5960
02:43:18,390 --> 02:43:18,870
What?

5961
02:43:19,050 --> 02:43:19,890
No, no, no.

5962
02:43:20,210 --> 02:43:21,230
You're so far.

5963
02:43:22,230 --> 02:43:23,170
What do you mean?

5964
02:43:23,250 --> 02:43:23,670
They're here.

5965
02:43:23,930 --> 02:43:24,850
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

5966
02:43:28,490 --> 02:43:29,270
I'm going to fight in front of them.

5967
02:43:31,470 --> 02:43:32,310
Maybe only one.

5968
02:43:32,390 --> 02:43:32,650
Oh, it's two rez.

5969
02:43:32,750 --> 02:43:33,090
No, no, no.

5970
02:43:33,110 --> 02:43:33,590
It's two to do.

5971
02:43:33,730 --> 02:43:34,210
Two rez, two rez.

5972
02:43:35,370 --> 02:43:36,130
I'm going, I'm going.

5973
02:43:37,610 --> 02:43:38,570
Tell me if you need Q.

5974
02:43:39,430 --> 02:43:39,910
Climb out.

5975
02:43:41,290 --> 02:43:43,870
Okay, I'm climbing out.

5976
02:43:44,730 --> 02:43:45,610
I don't need Q yet.

5977
02:43:45,650 --> 02:43:46,270
No Q, no Q.

5978
02:43:50,170 --> 02:43:50,450
Two.

5979
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:52,410
Let me know when you crack.

5980
02:43:52,550 --> 02:43:53,110
Let me know when you crack.

5981
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:54,770
When you crack, I'll call.

5982
02:43:54,770 --> 02:43:56,130
Not crack, not crack yet.

5983
02:43:56,270 --> 02:43:56,390
Okay.

5984
02:43:58,630 --> 02:44:00,410

5985
02:44:03,130 --> 02:44:03,730
Waiting too.

5986
02:44:08,930 --> 02:44:09,790
Wait, they're white armor.

5987
02:44:10,550 --> 02:44:11,850
Kill me, kill me, kill me.

5988
02:44:12,510 --> 02:44:12,950
Oh my god.

5989
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:17,840

Nice.

5991
02:44:19,780 --> 02:44:21,560
I don't know where teammates are.

5992
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:21,720

02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:33,930
Nice.

02:44:34,390 --> 02:44:36,270
They were white armor too.

6006
02:44:46,550 --> 02:44:47,210
Where's one of them?

6007
02:44:47,770 --> 02:44:48,770
Wait, someone, someone.

6008
02:44:48,970 --> 02:44:50,450
Oh wait, I hear someone.

6009
02:44:51,470 --> 02:44:52,490
Jump pad, yeah.

02:44:52,650 --> 02:44:53,050
Tower, tower.

6011
02:44:55,610 --> 02:44:56,490
Oh yeah.

6012
02:44:56,890 --> 02:44:57,730
Okay, where?

6013
02:44:57,990 --> 02:44:59,050
Are they gonna come?

6014
02:44:59,170 --> 02:45:00,630
No, no, no, no.

6015
02:45:00,630 --> 02:45:01,370
They're here.

6016
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:03,690
Okay, they're far, far, far, far, far.

6017
02:45:03,690 --> 02:45:04,210
Very far.

6018

Okay, okay, okay.

6019
02:45:08,570 --> 02:45:09,050
Crack.

6020
02:45:09,050 --> 02:45:09,170
I'm good.

6021
02:45:09,670 --> 02:45:10,470
I'm gonna heal.

6022
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:16,070
Whoa.

6023
02:45:16,530 --> 02:45:18,050

6027
02:45:22,490 --> 02:45:23,650
Where are the other boxes?

6028
02:45:24,670 --> 02:45:25,550
I don't know.

6029
02:45:25,610 --> 02:45:26,710
I'm flying, I'm flying.

6030
02:45:26,990 --> 02:45:28,130
You ping me some of the boxes?

6031
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:29,130
Wait, they might push.

6032
02:45:29,930 --> 02:45:30,410
Okay.

6033
02:45:32,010 --> 02:45:33,290
Yeah, they're coming closer.

6034
02:45:33,930 --> 02:45:35,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're here, they're here, they're here.

6035
02:45:36,270 --> 02:45:36,650
They're here.

6036
02:45:37,730 --> 02:45:38,050
Careful.

6037
02:45:39,170 --> 02:45:40,010
They're inside, they're inside.

6038
02:45:40,990 --> 02:45:41,630
Yeah, they're inside.

6039
02:45:44,010 --> 02:45:44,910
Uh, third floor?

02:45:45,050 --> 02:45:46,010
Yeah, yeah, let's go to third floor.

6041
02:45:46,290 --> 02:45:46,950
Let's get out, let's get out.

02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:48,430
Yeah, I'm not.

6043
02:45:49,130 --> 02:45:50,250
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm down, I'm down.

6044
02:45:53,930 --> 02:45:54,830
I might be dead here.

6045
02:45:54,970 --> 02:45:55,570
Oh, I cracked him?

6046
02:45:57,570 --> 02:45:58,190
Oh no!

6047
02:45:58,990 --> 02:45:59,630
Oh my god.

6048
02:46:00,310 --> 02:46:01,630
Run, Ditto, run!

6049
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:02,550
You can craft!

6050
02:46:02,990 --> 02:46:04,050
Don't be a hero!

6051
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:05,830
Don't be a hero!

6052
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:08,670
No hero time, just leave!

6053
02:46:09,490 --> 02:46:10,010
Leave!

6054
02:46:11,210 --> 02:46:12,250
No, Ditto!

6055
02:46:13,570 --> 02:46:15,010
I'm leaving, I'm leaving!

6056
02:46:15,370 --> 02:46:16,890
Don't be a hero, just run!

6057
02:46:20,810 --> 02:46:22,550
Oh, they're controller.

6058
02:46:22,990 --> 02:46:25,170
By the way, they're controller, just leave.

6059
02:46:26,250 --> 02:46:28,530
All three of them are controller, just leave.

6060
02:46:29,070 --> 02:46:29,590
All three of them are controller, just leave.

6061
02:46:29,630 --> 02:46:30,130
Okay.

6062
02:46:31,310 --> 02:46:34,990
Go as far as you can, so they can't aim assist you!

6063
02:46:35,910 --> 02:46:36,430
Okay.

6064
02:46:36,990 --> 02:46:37,970
Seven feet!

6065
02:46:38,250 --> 02:46:40,250
Cause it's out of the six feet range.

6066
02:46:40,850 --> 02:46:41,310
Okay.

6067
02:46:41,490 --> 02:46:43,290
Make sure you're seven feet away.

6068
02:46:45,550 --> 02:46:46,510
Let me sh...

6069
02:46:46,510 --> 02:46:47,830
Oh, you should heal though.

6070
02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:48,630

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6074
02:46:56,190 --> 02:46:58,970
Make sure you're seven feet away from the controller players.

6075
02:46:59,270 --> 02:46:59,610
Make sure you're seven feet away from the controller players.

6076
02:46:59,630 --> 02:47:00,950
Okay, seven feet is...

6077
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:03,470
Yeah, so you don't get me and get killed.

6078
02:47:06,850 --> 02:47:08,670
I wish I was a roller.

6079
02:47:11,590 --> 02:47:13,550
Why didn't we learn controller?

6080
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:17,590
Okay.

6081
02:47:20,930 --> 02:47:21,490
Nice.

6082
02:47:29,870 --> 02:47:31,190

02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:32,210
No, your res is here.

6084
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:32,690
Yeah.

6085
02:47:32,850 --> 02:47:33,150
Okay.

6086
02:47:35,070 --> 02:47:37,030
I don't know if they're gonna come to us.

6087
02:47:37,470 --> 02:47:38,770
Okay, they do.

6088
02:47:38,930 --> 02:47:39,990
We run.

6089
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:42,070
We run.

6090
02:47:47,430 --> 02:47:48,130
We run.

6091
02:47:49,910 --> 02:47:51,810
Wait, we're not being cowards.

6092
02:47:51,810 --> 02:47:52,590
It's strategy.

6093
02:47:53,050 --> 02:47:54,010
Oh, I see them!

6094
02:47:54,230 --> 02:47:55,150
I see them!

6095
02:47:55,270 --> 02:47:55,930
Run, run, run!

6096
02:47:56,790 --> 02:47:57,310
Oh, they're out.

6097
02:47:57,510 --> 02:47:58,210
Okay, I run.

6098
02:47:58,970 --> 02:47:59,930
Run, PS1.

6099
02:48:03,390 --> 02:48:03,910
Okay.

6100
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:06,270
Just run, just run.

6101
02:48:06,570 --> 02:48:07,050
Yeah.

6102
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:10,070
They saw me, they saw me, they saw me.

6103
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:11,330
They saw me.

6104
02:48:11,370 --> 02:48:11,470
Just run.

6105
02:48:12,270 --> 02:48:14,630
If one of us lives, that's okay.

6106
02:48:15,750 --> 02:48:17,470
Only one has to live.

6107
02:48:17,530 --> 02:48:18,430
What the heck?

6108
02:48:18,490 --> 02:48:19,110
What the heck?

6109
02:48:21,370 --> 02:48:21,890
What the fuck?

6110
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:22,890
What the fuck?

6111
02:48:27,090 --> 02:48:27,810
It's okay.

6112
02:48:28,710 --> 02:48:30,530
Just one of us has to live.

6113
02:48:31,810 --> 02:48:33,250
That's all we need.

6114
02:48:33,590 --> 02:48:34,070
Okay.

6115
02:48:34,110 --> 02:48:35,450
See you, see you later.

6116
02:48:35,470 --> 02:48:36,470
See you later, everybody.

6117
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:38,630
See you later.

6118
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:41,250
We'll meet again soon.

6119
02:48:41,390 --> 02:48:42,790
We'll meet again soon.

6120
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,520
Okay, I'm safe right now.

6121
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:48,760
Are they chasing?

6122
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:50,000
Nice, nice, nice.

6123
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:52,320
They're chasing me, they're chasing me!

6124
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,020
No, why me?

6125
02:48:56,240 --> 02:48:56,720
What?

6126
02:48:57,440 --> 02:48:57,920
What?

6127
02:48:59,540 --> 02:49:00,020
What?

6128
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:04,160
Okay, this is a controlling friend squad.

6129
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:07,000
Wait, you attacked him?

6130
02:49:07,240 --> 02:49:08,260
Wait, who did that?

6131
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:08,600
You!

6132
02:49:10,380 --> 02:49:11,960
Who killed you?

6133
02:49:11,980 --> 02:49:12,460
What is it here?

6134
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:13,420
Who?

6135
02:49:15,980 --> 02:49:17,800
Who killed you guys?

6136
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:22,140
Who killed you guys?

6137
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:23,700
Oh my god.

6138
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:26,260
This chasing shit's all hard.

6139
02:49:26,380 --> 02:49:28,760
You know what was worse?

6140
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,580
They were controller friend players.

6141
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:34,620
Not only were they friend, they were controller friend.

6142
02:49:35,400 --> 02:49:36,840
Controller friend, I see.

6143
02:49:37,240 --> 02:49:39,020
They were less out of life.

6144
02:49:39,280 --> 02:49:42,120
That changes everything.

6145
02:49:44,580 --> 02:49:46,920
Guys, it wasn't stream snipers.

6146
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:48,520
They're just good at the game.

6147
02:49:50,020 --> 02:49:52,360
We would know if it's stream sniper.

6148
02:49:52,660 --> 02:49:53,600
We would know.

6149
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:57,240
They saw a rez and they saw me.

6150
02:49:59,960 --> 02:50:01,260
Oh, okay.

6151
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:01,960
Okay.

6152
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:08,000
Oh my god.

6153
02:50:09,280 --> 02:50:10,240
They are so thirsty.

6154
02:50:10,620 --> 02:50:12,060
They want more kills.

6155
02:50:12,180 --> 02:50:13,620
They want to get to friend again.

6156
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:15,780
Oh, I see.

6157
02:50:15,900 --> 02:50:17,140
Is that a friend team?

6158
02:50:17,440 --> 02:50:18,880
Yeah, that was a friend team.

6159
02:50:19,240 --> 02:50:20,520
Oh, we are friend 2.

6160
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:22,600
Yeah, but they're controller friend.

6161
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:23,360
That's different.

6162
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:27,160
That's better than the pro player.

6163
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:32,540
That's better than pro.

6164
02:50:39,740 --> 02:50:40,940
Oh my god.

6165
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:41,160
Let's see.

6166
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:46,680
Like, they pushed us.

6167
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:48,720
They pushed us so fast.

6168
02:50:48,760 --> 02:50:49,340
Holy shit.

6169
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:50,460
Yeah, they pushed us so fast.

6170
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:53,800
When I got deleted, I was like, oh god.

6171
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:59,820
I was just like, they just...

6172
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:03,320
I didn't want to live in this game.

6173
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:07,380
Oh, 72 players?

6174
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:09,320
What the fuck?

6175
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:12,740
Oh my god.

6176
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:14,920
This is two lobbies.

6177
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:15,900
This is two lobbies.

6178
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:15,960
Yes.

6179
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:20,020
It's still noon.

6180
02:51:20,020 --> 02:51:20,480
It's still noon.

6181
02:51:20,900 --> 02:51:22,080
Everyone is sleeping.

6182
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:25,120
No, wake up.

6183
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:27,980
You don't sleep when you're grinding rank.

6184
02:51:29,640 --> 02:51:30,280
Alright.

6185
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:34,880
Yesterday, I watched ChenVertian's team.

6186
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:35,740
Yeah.

6187
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:37,360
He had been still playing.

6188
02:51:37,380 --> 02:51:40,280
He was still streaming for 46 hours.

6189
02:51:40,540 --> 02:51:41,180
Holy shit.

6190
02:51:41,560 --> 02:51:42,920
Yeah, number one Pred.

6191
02:51:43,020 --> 02:51:43,260
Yeah.

6192
02:51:43,620 --> 02:51:44,140
Yeah.

6193
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:48,800
It's not like he's gonna keep it.

6194
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:50,680
Because he has scrims.

6195
02:51:50,680 --> 02:51:51,700
He has pro league.

6196
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:54,920
Yeah, so like, what's the point?

6197
02:51:55,060 --> 02:51:56,960
I guess he wants to be the first team.

6198
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:59,200
Like the first player.

6199
02:51:59,620 --> 02:52:01,860
But he's not gonna keep Pred.

6200
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:08,060
Yeah, it's because he has to do ARGS.

6201
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:09,320
Yeah, he has to do ARGS.

6202
02:52:09,380 --> 02:52:10,380
There's no way he's gonna...

6203
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:15,440
Normally, people who do rank 1 Pred has like... is like content creator.

6204
02:52:16,080 --> 02:52:17,260
Because they don't have time.

6205
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:18,720
Oh yeah.

6206
02:52:18,960 --> 02:52:19,480
Yes.

6207
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:22,760
They don't have time for rank.

6208
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:25,820
Uto, when are you gonna do Pred?

6209
02:52:26,360 --> 02:52:27,220
Come to Pred.

6210
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:29,120
Pred?

6211
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:29,680
Yeah.

6212
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:31,120
Yeah, Uto.

6213
02:52:31,520 --> 02:52:32,040
Pred?

6214
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:32,840
Get Pred.

6215
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:34,460
Pred?

6216
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:35,360
Yeah, you.

6217
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:36,940
Get Pred?

6218
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:37,660
Yeah, you.

6219
02:52:38,300 --> 02:52:39,160
No, no, no.

6220
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:39,640
Why not?

6221
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:41,500
Why?

6222
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:43,160
Why?

6223
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:44,400
Fake news.

6224
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:46,500
Get Pred.

6225
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:50,660
You can get Pred.

6226
02:52:52,180 --> 02:52:52,680
You can get Pred.

6227
02:52:52,680 --> 02:52:53,880
No, I'm not gonna go play.

6228
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:54,320
So easy.

6229
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:56,260
No, we don't have to.

6230
02:52:56,340 --> 02:52:56,960
We already got it.

6231
02:52:58,100 --> 02:52:59,400
Yeah, but Uto.

6232
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:00,340
Pred.

6233
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:02,460
When?

6234
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:04,240
Prato?

6235
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:04,800
Yeah.

6236
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:08,740
Today is today.

6237
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:09,420
Today?

6238
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:11,760
You told me there's people here.

6239
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:13,320
Not today.

6240
02:53:13,360 --> 02:53:14,440
I give you cue.

6241
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:16,300
I give you cue.

6242
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:19,520
Please, why didn't you tell me there's a team?

6243
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:22,460
Oh, I didn't see.

6244
02:53:23,660 --> 02:53:24,860
One team?

6245
02:53:25,060 --> 02:53:25,460
Really?

6246
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:26,180
Yeah.

6247
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:29,160
Look at my HP.

6248
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:33,200
Two of them.

6249
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:35,220
Look at my HP.

6250
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:36,380
Am I lying?

6251
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:39,180
I see him.

6252
02:53:39,220 --> 02:53:39,780
He's over here.

6253
02:53:40,100 --> 02:53:40,400
Solo.

6254
02:53:40,500 --> 02:53:40,780
Solo.

6255
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:41,360
Pass fighter.

6256
02:53:42,740 --> 02:53:43,140
Okay.

6257
02:53:45,660 --> 02:53:46,460
Got that one.

6258
02:53:46,580 --> 02:53:47,060
No, no, no.

6259
02:53:47,440 --> 02:53:47,840
Nice.

6260
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:48,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6261
02:53:48,680 --> 02:53:49,460
I'm pushing.

6262
02:53:49,900 --> 02:53:50,460
I'm pushing.

6263
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:53,000
Don't let them res.

6264
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:53,540
Don't let them res.

6265
02:53:56,480 --> 02:53:57,200
Do you have cue?

6266
02:53:57,660 --> 02:53:58,060
Crack?

6267
02:53:58,660 --> 02:53:59,320
Low, low.

6268
02:53:59,420 --> 02:53:59,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6269
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:00,240
Okay.

6270
02:54:02,040 --> 02:54:02,320
One down.

6271
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:03,060
Nice.

6272
02:54:03,360 --> 02:54:04,200
One down.

6273
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:05,320
Last one.

6274
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:06,180
Last one.

6275
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:06,340
Last one.

6276
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:12,740
That's fucking right.

6277
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:13,400
Nice one.

6278
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:14,660
Nice one.

6279
02:54:14,720 --> 02:54:15,020
Yeah.

6280
02:54:15,820 --> 02:54:16,900
Nice one.

6281
02:54:16,900 --> 02:54:18,220
So, Uto, when pre-ed?

6282
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:19,460
Uto.

6283
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:20,300
Today.

6284
02:54:20,500 --> 02:54:20,600
So good.

6285
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:21,340
Today.

6286
02:54:21,400 --> 02:54:22,260
So good.

6287
02:54:22,580 --> 02:54:22,980
Today.

6288
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:24,240
Yeah.

6289
02:54:25,080 --> 02:54:25,680
Today?

6290
02:54:26,060 --> 02:54:27,320
How many hours?

6291
02:54:27,320 --> 02:54:28,260
46 hours?

6292
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:31,120
24.

6293
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:31,720
26.

6294
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:33,240
24 hours?

6295
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:34,300
Yes.

6296
02:54:35,220 --> 02:54:37,340
You stream for 24 hours?

6297
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:43,040
Dido and I can end stream and you do 24 hours.

6298
02:54:44,880 --> 02:54:45,960
What the...

6299
02:54:46,980 --> 02:54:47,660
Go.

6300
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:50,520
That's too much.

6301
02:54:50,840 --> 02:54:51,680
That's too much.

6302
02:54:51,980 --> 02:54:52,380
No, no.

6303
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:54,100
She will do 24 hours.

6304
02:54:54,180 --> 02:54:54,620
We sleep.

6305
02:54:55,540 --> 02:54:56,800
No, no, no.

6306
02:54:57,240 --> 02:54:59,400
No, no.

6307
02:54:59,400 --> 02:55:01,660
You didn't tell that you're gonna play with us.

6308
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:02,700
Yeah, you didn't tell us.

6309
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:03,720
We sleep.

6310
02:55:03,940 --> 02:55:04,360
No.

6311
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:05,820
No, no, no.

6312
02:55:05,980 --> 02:55:07,260
You can't sleep.

6313
02:55:07,660 --> 02:55:08,860
Oh, she can't sleep?

6314
02:55:10,700 --> 02:55:14,080
I feel like Dido now will get pre-ed before she gets pre-ed.

6315
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:15,460
Okay, okay.

6316
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:18,440
Oh my god.

6317
02:55:19,480 --> 02:55:20,960
Uto's basement is clear.

6318
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:23,500
Okay, so Dido doesn't sleep.

6319
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:23,880

Why did you...

6492
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:41,780
Why did you...

6493
03:00:49,240 --> 03:00:50,720
No sound!

6494
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:51,940
Oh my god.

6495
03:00:52,460 --> 03:00:53,260
No sound.

6496
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:54,460
No sound.

6497
03:00:55,020 --> 03:00:57,240
Yeah, they just showed up.

6498
03:00:58,940 --> 03:00:59,700

03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:06,780
The only audio that I can hear is a gunshot.

6502
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:10,080
No sound.

6503
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:11,000
No sound.

6504
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:12,040
Oh my god.

That's actually crazy.

6507
03:01:24,680 --> 03:01:25,320
That's actually crazy.

6508
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:28,180
We stay easy, We stay easy, and they kill us.

6509
03:01:28,400 --> 03:01:30,380
And we just die so fast.

6510
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:32,800
Oh my god.

6511
03:01:32,800 --> 03:01:33,640
There's a curse word.

6512
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:39,300
Oh...

6513
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:41,520
Nice, nice, nice.

6514
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:42,320
Go next.

6515
03:01:42,760 --> 03:01:44,000
Oh my god.

6516
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:45,120
Nice try, nice try.

6517
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:52,620
That's crazy.

6518
03:02:06,220 --> 03:02:06,880
Ah...

6519
03:02:06,880 --> 03:02:08,000
Okay,

6520
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:13,180
okay.

6521
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:14,440
Let's win.

6522
03:02:15,300 --> 03:02:17,680
We end on champion.

6523
03:02:19,240 --> 03:02:19,900
Okay...

6524
03:02:19,900 --> 03:02:21,100
We end on champion.

6525
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:23,340
Yeah, we end on champion.

6526
03:02:23,660 --> 03:02:26,760
Yeah, and then Uto can keep playing and get Pred.

6527
03:02:26,980 --> 03:02:27,520
No!

6528
03:02:28,300 --> 03:02:29,720
I want to sleep!

6529
03:02:30,140 --> 03:02:33,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6530
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:33,620
I crashed.

6531
03:02:33,860 --> 03:02:34,420
No!

6532
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:43,740
No, I go sleep.

6533
03:02:44,280 --> 03:02:46,120
My crash!

6534
03:02:48,140 --> 03:02:49,180
My crash!

6535
03:02:49,180 --> 03:02:49,180
My crash!

6536
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:50,300
We end on champion!

6537
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:52,700
But, no, okay.

6538
03:02:52,900 --> 03:02:55,160
Ditto and I end on champion.

6539
03:02:55,400 --> 03:02:56,780
Uto keeps playing until Pred.

6540
03:02:56,940 --> 03:02:58,140
Uto ends on Pred.

6541
03:02:58,140 --> 03:02:59,580
No, no, no, no, no.

6542
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:00,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

6543
03:03:00,740 --> 03:03:01,660
No, no, no.

6544
03:03:01,700 --> 03:03:02,120
Yes, yes.

6545
03:03:02,700 --> 03:03:03,580
I believe.

6546
03:03:03,720 --> 03:03:04,800
We believe, right?

6547
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:07,560
We believe in Pred Uto.

6548
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:11,920
Yeah, Uto, show us your Pred.

6549
03:03:12,120 --> 03:03:12,380
Yeah.

6550
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:14,160
One team, one team!

6551
03:03:14,840 --> 03:03:15,360
Okay.

6552
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:17,680
Wait, but what about me?

6553
03:03:18,680 --> 03:03:19,600
Yeah, bye, yeah, bye.

6554
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:24,160
You're good?

6555
03:03:25,580 --> 03:03:26,180
I'm good.

6556
03:03:26,260 --> 03:03:26,520
I'm here.

6557
03:03:27,360 --> 03:03:28,180
Okay, nice.

6558
03:03:28,260 --> 03:03:29,080
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6559
03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:29,780
I need gun.

6560
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:31,940
I go get gun.

6561
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:33,660
Nice, nice.

6562
03:03:38,540 --> 03:03:40,200
Two guys on left side.

6563
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:42,000
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

6564
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:44,520
Alright, I'm good.

6565
03:03:48,410 --> 03:03:49,310
One guy there.

6566
03:03:53,780 --> 03:03:54,200
Alright.

6567
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:55,620
I'm good now.

6568
03:03:55,760 --> 03:03:56,640
Yeah, let's do that.

6569
03:03:58,420 --> 03:03:58,820
Okay.

6570
03:03:58,960 --> 03:03:59,260
I'm ready.

6571
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:01,320
I'm gonna open this then.

6572
03:04:02,560 --> 03:04:03,480
I'm ready for you guys.

6573
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:09,920
I don't know if they are leaving.

6574
03:04:10,460 --> 03:04:11,040
Are they?

6575
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:12,040
Are they still in?

6576
03:04:12,320 --> 03:04:13,180
On me, on me, on me, on me!

6577
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:15,220
On me.

6578
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:15,560
Cracked?

6579
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:17,680
I have to back out.

6580
03:04:17,780 --> 03:04:18,840
I cracked one though.

6581
03:04:20,380 --> 03:04:21,140
I need help.

6582
03:04:23,940 --> 03:04:24,340
Okay.

6583
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:26,580
I'm trying to cover you.

6584
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:27,920
Are they coming to me?

6585
03:04:31,720 --> 03:04:32,480
They're still here.

6586
03:04:32,580 --> 03:04:33,320
They're still on bridge.

6587
03:04:33,460 --> 03:04:34,000
They come to me.

6588
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:35,480
Yeah, they're coming to Ditto.

6589
03:04:35,620 --> 03:04:36,140
We have to help.

6590
03:04:37,320 --> 03:04:37,680
Careful.

6591
03:04:38,340 --> 03:04:38,740
I'm here.

6592
03:04:40,140 --> 03:04:40,740
I'm on bridge.

6593
03:04:41,160 --> 03:04:42,020
Wait, where's the third?

6594
03:04:43,640 --> 03:04:44,360
There's no third.

6595
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:45,180
Oh, it's duo?

6596
03:04:45,460 --> 03:04:45,900
They're getting inside.

6597
03:04:46,280 --> 03:04:47,040
Okay, I'm inside.

6598
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:49,120
Careful.

6599
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:49,340
Help.

6600
03:04:49,380 --> 03:04:49,800
Help Ditto.

6601
03:04:50,020 --> 03:04:50,260
Okay.

6602
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:53,680
Only two?

6603
03:04:53,740 --> 03:04:54,040
Only two?

6604
03:04:54,280 --> 03:04:55,120
Oh, sorry.

6605
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:56,360
Three, three, three.

6606
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:57,860
Three, three, three.

6607
03:04:59,020 --> 03:04:59,940
I'm dead here.

6608
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:00,880
Nice one.

6609
03:05:01,980 --> 03:05:03,500
Oh, I cracked them though.

6610
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:04,600
Last one, last one.

6611
03:05:05,220 --> 03:05:05,740
Yeah.

6612
03:05:08,740 --> 03:05:10,560
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more.

6613
03:05:11,720 --> 03:05:12,600
No more shields.

6614
03:05:12,960 --> 03:05:14,360
No, it's conduit.

6615
03:05:16,480 --> 03:05:17,520
It's conduit.

6616
03:05:17,880 --> 03:05:18,040
Sorry.

6617
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:18,640
It's conduit.

6618
03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:18,900
Sorry.

6619
03:05:19,720 --> 03:05:20,240
Sorry.

6620
03:05:20,820 --> 03:05:22,080
It was three.

6621
03:05:22,780 --> 03:05:24,020
Oh, we're so close.

6622
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:25,300
Yeah.

6623
03:05:27,620 --> 03:05:28,080
Okay.

6624
03:05:28,300 --> 03:05:28,760
It's okay.

6625
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:29,860
We end on champion.

6626
03:05:30,140 --> 03:05:30,860
This is it.

6627
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:31,140
Okay.

6628
03:05:31,560 --> 03:05:32,440
This time.

6629
03:05:32,500 --> 03:05:33,000
This time.

6630
03:05:33,220 --> 03:05:33,240
This time.

6631
03:05:33,240 --> 03:05:33,500
This time.

6632
03:05:33,580 --> 03:05:33,880
Okay.

6633
03:05:34,420 --> 03:05:35,880
Now I know what to play.

6634
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:36,280
Oh, champion.

6635
03:05:37,200 --> 03:05:38,120
Nice champion.

6636
03:05:39,460 --> 03:05:42,260
I think we got two champions today.

6637
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,080
No, it was one.

6638
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:45,360
Oh, one.

6639
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:46,020
One.

6640
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:46,400
It was one.

6641
03:05:46,780 --> 03:05:47,500
Oh, no.

6642
03:05:47,720 --> 03:05:48,020
Oh, no.

6643
03:05:48,020 --> 03:05:48,100
Oh, no.

6644
03:05:49,580 --> 03:05:50,240
Oh, no.

6645
03:05:50,260 --> 03:05:52,340
We got one.

6646
03:05:52,460 --> 03:05:53,800
I thought we got two.

6647
03:05:54,320 --> 03:05:55,900
No, we got...

6648
03:05:55,900 --> 03:05:57,420
We got one.

6649
03:05:58,040 --> 03:05:58,060
Okay, one.

6650
03:05:58,060 --> 03:05:58,100
One.

6651
03:05:58,320 --> 03:05:58,920
One.

6652
03:05:58,920 --> 03:05:59,860
Okay, one.

6653
03:06:00,720 --> 03:06:02,360
Look, we're nerfing ourselves.

6654
03:06:02,640 --> 03:06:03,720
We're nerfing ourselves.

6655
03:06:05,660 --> 03:06:06,300
That's all.

6656
03:06:06,380 --> 03:06:06,660
Guys.

6657
03:06:06,880 --> 03:06:07,240
Guys.

6658
03:06:07,820 --> 03:06:10,900
It's cause we were purposely playing bad.

6659
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:11,720
We're...

6660
03:06:14,380 --> 03:06:17,620
We play on 500 speed.

6661
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:17,900
Yeah.

6662
03:06:17,900 --> 03:06:19,460
This is all on purpose.

6663
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:20,240
Yeah.

6664
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:26,880
Wow.

6665
03:06:28,580 --> 03:06:29,720

6666
03:06:30,520 --> 03:06:31,480
Master here.

6667
03:06:32,640 --> 03:06:33,280
Master.

6668
03:06:36,220 --> 03:06:38,580
Oh my god, I got...

6669
03:06:38,580 --> 03:06:40,100
I got lost.

6670
03:06:42,660 --> 03:06:43,300
Lost.

6671
03:06:43,300 --> 03:06:43,740
There you go.

6672
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:45,940
Come on, we can do this.

6673
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:49,020
We can win a... not second game.

6674
03:06:49,820 --> 03:06:50,840
Just lobby broken.

6675
03:06:50,840 --> 03:06:54,280
We can do it.

6676
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:55,900
I got so many lost.

6677
03:06:56,460 --> 03:06:57,720
Oh no, that's not good.

6678
03:06:57,940 --> 03:06:58,620
One team.

6679
03:06:58,920 --> 03:06:59,400
I'm okay.

6680
03:07:00,120 --> 03:07:01,000
Two teams?

6681
03:07:01,360 --> 03:07:01,740
Two teams?

6682
03:07:02,460 --> 03:07:03,340
One, one, one.

6683
03:07:03,340 --> 03:07:04,440
One, one, one, one, one.

6684
03:07:05,380 --> 03:07:06,320
One over there.

6685
03:07:09,100 --> 03:07:09,700
There's a...

6686
03:07:09,700 --> 03:07:10,020
On top.

6687
03:07:10,220 --> 03:07:10,720
There's a...

6688
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:11,800
Fuck, okay.

6689
03:07:12,560 --> 03:07:13,580
There's a guy behind me.

6690
03:07:13,580 --> 03:07:14,660
I'm going to you, I'm going to you.

6691
03:07:14,800 --> 03:07:15,140
Oh, what?

6692
03:07:15,640 --> 03:07:16,160
Yeah, yeah.

6693
03:07:16,160 --> 03:07:16,660
Behind me.

6694
03:07:16,700 --> 03:07:17,240
Oh my god!

6695
03:07:17,740 --> 03:07:18,180
Wow!

6696
03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:19,460
I got stuck.

6697
03:07:20,840 --> 03:07:21,840
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm okay.

6698
03:07:22,460 --> 03:07:22,980
I'm okay.

6699
03:07:23,900 --> 03:07:25,000
I'm worried to help you now.

6700
03:07:25,820 --> 03:07:26,400
Pack one.

6701
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:27,340
Alright, here.

6702
03:07:29,020 --> 03:07:30,640
It is two, it is two teams.

6703
03:07:30,700 --> 03:07:31,020
Careful.

6704
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:33,200
Okay, two teams, okay.

6705
03:07:33,320 --> 03:07:33,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6706
03:07:34,320 --> 03:07:35,080
Oh my god.

6707
03:07:35,340 --> 03:07:36,640
This lobby is so laggy.

6708
03:07:38,940 --> 03:07:40,280
Maybe we can go...

6709
03:07:40,700 --> 03:07:41,080
Train?

6710
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:42,460
Yeah.

6711
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:44,360
Yeah, okay, we can go.

6712
03:07:44,480 --> 03:07:45,060
Let's go, let's go.

6713
03:07:45,720 --> 03:07:46,680
Oh, it's landslide.

6714
03:07:47,060 --> 03:07:48,000
It's not train yard.

6715
03:07:49,020 --> 03:07:49,880
It's the same thing.

6716
03:07:50,620 --> 03:07:53,240
There is two, because there's a team behind us, I'm pretty sure.

6717
03:07:53,500 --> 03:07:53,800
Okay, okay.

6718
03:07:54,160 --> 03:07:56,000
And we are going to get sandwiched.

6719
03:07:56,200 --> 03:07:56,900
We should leave.

6720
03:07:56,920 --> 03:07:56,980
Yeah, yeah.

6721
03:07:57,060 --> 03:07:58,600
I don't want to get sandwiched at all.

6722
03:07:58,960 --> 03:08:00,800
We also have bad loot anyway.

6723
03:08:01,820 --> 03:08:02,220
Yeah.

6724
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:04,300
Oh my god.

6725
03:08:05,780 --> 03:08:08,320
Oh, it's not hammer point, it's a score PSO.

6726
03:08:08,460 --> 03:08:10,100
This is, this is why we've been losing.

6727
03:08:10,180 --> 03:08:11,800
We haven't been finding hammer points.

6728
03:08:15,400 --> 03:08:16,020
There you go.

6729
03:08:16,260 --> 03:08:17,780
Our luck has not been good to us.

6730
03:08:18,020 --> 03:08:18,040
Let's go.

6731
03:08:19,460 --> 03:08:19,860
Let's go.

6732
03:08:19,860 --> 03:08:22,320
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

6733
03:08:24,540 --> 03:08:26,020
Oh, there's loot here.

6734
03:08:28,420 --> 03:08:29,000
What?

6735
03:08:29,220 --> 03:08:31,720
That, oh, that, careful, careful.

6736
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:32,400
What?

6737
03:08:32,560 --> 03:08:33,120
No, that was me.

6738
03:08:34,180 --> 03:08:34,760
Okay.

6739
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:41,060
That sounds like enemies.

6740
03:08:41,060 --> 03:08:41,100
That was me.

6741
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:44,460
Like enemies, that sounds really like enemies.

6742
03:08:45,040 --> 03:08:45,620
Revenant.

6743
03:08:46,060 --> 03:08:46,680
Oh yeah, scan?

6744
03:08:47,180 --> 03:08:47,980
If you can.

6745
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:49,120
Okay.

6746
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:49,840
Yeah.

6747
03:08:49,860 --> 03:08:50,320
The guy.

6748
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:51,820
Okay, okay.

6749
03:08:51,960 --> 03:08:53,320
I will open the box.

6750
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:57,240
I'm gonna see if there's anyone near us.

6751
03:08:59,860 --> 03:09:00,300
Oh.

6752
03:09:02,060 --> 03:09:03,880
I won't, I won't craft yet.

6753
03:09:04,340 --> 03:09:05,860
I will keep it for...

6754
03:09:05,860 --> 03:09:06,460
Let's see.

6755
03:09:07,100 --> 03:09:09,400
We'll try to see if we can kill.

6756
03:09:09,500 --> 03:09:10,840
Actually, I feel like we're gonna get thirded.

6757
03:09:11,220 --> 03:09:12,920
I don't know who to fight actually.

6758
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:18,440
Our loot is so bad.

6759
03:09:18,860 --> 03:09:19,840
Yeah, and the...

6760
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:22,080
I think we should keep loading first.

6761
03:09:22,380 --> 03:09:22,480
Yeah.

6762
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:28,520
I mean we can go here and see if they start fighting it in Fragment.

6763
03:09:28,600 --> 03:09:28,760
Okay.

6764
03:09:28,840 --> 03:09:30,020
Oh okay, yeah yeah.

6765
03:09:30,100 --> 03:09:30,640
That's nice.

6766
03:09:30,840 --> 03:09:31,240
That's nice.

6767
03:09:31,700 --> 03:09:32,920
Yeah, I'm gonna go over then.

6768
03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:35,180
I'm gonna start going to Fragment.

6769
03:09:36,520 --> 03:09:37,800
Woah, Energy Mag.

6770
03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:41,800
I'm gonna get up here.

6771
03:09:41,980 --> 03:09:43,300
Oh my god, that scared me.

6772
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:44,360
Yeah.

6773
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:45,820
That always scares me.

6774
03:09:46,100 --> 03:09:47,720
I feel like I'm being shot.

6775
03:09:48,940 --> 03:09:50,560
I know, I know.

6776
03:09:53,220 --> 03:09:55,520
Uh... grab the hemlock.

6777
03:09:56,220 --> 03:09:59,200
If you found any skull, please tell me.

6778
03:09:59,400 --> 03:09:59,920
Alright.

6779
03:10:00,940 --> 03:10:02,060
I think it's two.

6780
03:10:02,220 --> 03:10:03,240
Two eggs or two.

6781
03:10:03,520 --> 03:10:04,440
Skull piercer?

6782
03:10:07,360 --> 03:10:08,400
Skull piercer.

6783
03:10:08,620 --> 03:10:09,260
Skull piercer.

6784
03:10:09,980 --> 03:10:11,760
I think it was like a long time ago.

6785
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:14,420
Oh no, I got it.

6786
03:10:14,580 --> 03:10:15,080
I got a skull.

6787
03:10:15,080 --> 03:10:15,420
Okay, nice.

6788
03:10:15,500 --> 03:10:15,760
Okay.

6789
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:19,760
Are they still fighting?

6790
03:10:20,540 --> 03:10:23,560
I have no idea, but I'm looting right now.

6791
03:10:24,440 --> 03:10:24,800
Okay.

6792
03:10:25,440 --> 03:10:26,280
Uh... I'll check.

6793
03:10:26,400 --> 03:10:27,080
I think I'm good.

6794
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:29,100
I think I'm good with my loot.

6795
03:10:30,060 --> 03:10:32,820
I'm gonna go check and I'm gonna grab a harvester.

6796
03:10:33,260 --> 03:10:33,880
Oh, they're fighting.

6797
03:10:33,980 --> 03:10:34,200
They're fighting.

6798
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:35,280
Okay.

6799
03:10:35,300 --> 03:10:35,460
Okay.

6800
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:35,700
Okay.

6801
03:10:35,700 --> 03:10:35,840
Okay.

6802
03:10:35,940 --> 03:10:36,300
Yeah.

6803
03:10:36,480 --> 03:10:37,120
Yeah, in front of me.

6804
03:10:37,420 --> 03:10:38,180
Oh, woah woah woah.

6805
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:38,580
New team.

6806
03:10:38,600 --> 03:10:39,280
New team here too.

6807
03:10:39,680 --> 03:10:40,200
New team.

6808
03:10:40,340 --> 03:10:41,540
Wait for the new team.

6809
03:10:41,660 --> 03:10:41,900
Wait wait wait.

6810
03:10:42,020 --> 03:10:42,380
Yeah yeah yeah.

6811
03:10:42,540 --> 03:10:42,900
But...

6812
03:10:42,900 --> 03:10:43,660
Okay, okay, okay.

6813
03:10:43,660 --> 03:10:44,280
Only one.

6814
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:44,740
Only one.

6815
03:10:45,280 --> 03:10:45,820
This guy.

6816
03:10:45,940 --> 03:10:46,620
There's a guy right here.

6817
03:10:46,620 --> 03:10:47,160
Oh no, no, no.

6818
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:47,700
One team here.

6819
03:10:47,700 --> 03:10:48,420
One team, one team, yeah.

6820
03:10:48,500 --> 03:10:48,980
Over there.

6821
03:10:49,140 --> 03:10:50,120
Yeah, there's three teams.

6822
03:10:50,140 --> 03:10:50,740
I'm ready, I'm ready.

6823
03:10:51,400 --> 03:10:52,200
They're still...

6824
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:53,040
They stay there.

6825
03:10:53,260 --> 03:10:55,040
Yeah yeah, and there's a team here too.

6826
03:10:55,280 --> 03:10:55,920
Under the bridge.

6827
03:10:56,600 --> 03:10:58,000
They might fight each other.

6828
03:10:59,020 --> 03:11:00,220
Yeah, they're pushing, they're pushing.

6829
03:11:00,260 --> 03:11:01,280
They're pushing, they're pushing.

6830
03:11:01,280 --> 03:11:01,580
They're pushing, they're pushing.

6831
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:05,320
Knocked one.

6832
03:11:05,500 --> 03:11:05,740
Nice!

6833
03:11:05,740 --> 03:11:06,680
Knocked one, nice one.

6834
03:11:06,980 --> 03:11:07,440
On me, on me.

6835
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:08,840
Here.

6836
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:12,740
Almost caked.

6837
03:11:13,160 --> 03:11:13,900
Almost caked.

6838
03:11:14,300 --> 03:11:14,360
Crack crack crack crack.

6839
03:11:14,380 --> 03:11:14,780
Over our house.

6840
03:11:14,860 --> 03:11:15,420
This is three...

6841
03:11:15,420 --> 03:11:16,860
This is a full team behind me.

6842
03:11:17,700 --> 03:11:18,500
Very weak, very low.

6843
03:11:19,620 --> 03:11:19,940
Okay.

6844
03:11:24,820 --> 03:11:25,660
Teammates here, teammates, teammates.

6845
03:11:28,240 --> 03:11:29,100
Oh, I don't have ammo.

6846
03:11:29,940 --> 03:11:30,260
Fuck.

6847
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:31,720
No more ammo.

6848
03:11:33,200 --> 03:11:33,960
I don't go light.

6849
03:11:33,960 --> 03:11:34,980
I think we have to back out.

6850
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:36,120
Oh my god.

6851
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:37,840
There's still three teams, there's still three teams.

6852
03:11:38,080 --> 03:11:38,500
Okay, okay.

6853
03:11:38,640 --> 03:11:39,460
I'll go back.

6854
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:40,680
Yeah, yeah, come to me, come to me, come to me.

6855
03:11:41,280 --> 03:11:41,860
Okay, okay.

6856
03:11:41,900 --> 03:11:43,180
I didn't get a kill.

6857
03:11:43,340 --> 03:11:43,840
Full kill.

6858
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:44,680
Do you guys have heavy?

6859
03:11:45,820 --> 03:11:46,140
Wow.

6860
03:11:46,300 --> 03:11:46,560
No.

6861
03:11:47,140 --> 03:11:48,600
I have heavy, I have heavy.

6862
03:11:48,700 --> 03:11:49,280
Yeah, yeah, can I have some?

6863
03:11:50,420 --> 03:11:50,940
You have some.

6864
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:52,160
I'll give you one stack.

6865
03:11:52,340 --> 03:11:53,220
Yeah, thank you.

6866
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:55,020
I'll give you one stack of G.

6867
03:11:58,180 --> 03:11:59,220
Thank you.

6868
03:11:59,220 --> 03:12:01,760
Thank you for the one stack of three.

6869
03:12:03,720 --> 03:12:05,040
They all left.

6870
03:12:05,500 --> 03:12:06,060
They all left.

6871
03:12:06,720 --> 03:12:08,060
I think they rez too.

6872
03:12:09,140 --> 03:12:11,880
I think we, we can finish them.

6873
03:12:12,060 --> 03:12:12,600
That Horizon.

6874
03:12:12,980 --> 03:12:13,920
Where's that Horizon?

6875
03:12:14,300 --> 03:12:16,580
I don't, I think, I think they rez her.

6876
03:12:16,940 --> 03:12:20,140
Wait, my, my, my, it doesn't work.

6877
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:20,180
My Uri, my Uri, my Uri.

6878
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:21,460
Wait, what?

6879
03:12:22,300 --> 03:12:23,680
I don't know, maybe it's bug.

6880
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:27,160
I'm trying to see if we can find them.

6881
03:12:27,960 --> 03:12:28,880
Wait, they're fighting again.

6882
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:29,400
Here.

6883
03:12:30,220 --> 03:12:31,220
Okay, let's go, let's go.

6884
03:12:31,520 --> 03:12:32,080
I think that's them.

6885
03:12:32,340 --> 03:12:32,560
Okay.

6886
03:12:33,820 --> 03:12:34,200
Careful.

6887
03:12:34,920 --> 03:12:35,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6888
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:36,480
They got knocked, I think.

6889
03:12:37,120 --> 03:12:38,160
That jump head here.

6890
03:12:42,040 --> 03:12:42,780
I'm going over.

6891
03:12:45,680 --> 03:12:46,060
Ooh.

6892
03:12:46,660 --> 03:12:47,300
Grab this.

6893
03:12:48,420 --> 03:12:48,800
Okay.

6894
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:50,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6895
03:12:50,900 --> 03:12:51,860
Far, far though, far, far.

6896
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:52,440
Okay.

6897
03:12:54,400 --> 03:12:55,180
Can I shoot?

6898
03:12:55,520 --> 03:12:57,380
Oh no, I'm not, I'm not gonna shoot that.

6899
03:12:57,380 --> 03:12:58,300
They're far, they're far, they're far, they're far.

6900
03:12:58,460 --> 03:12:58,880
Okay.

6901
03:12:58,960 --> 03:13:00,400
Tell me if you need my Q.

6902
03:13:00,940 --> 03:13:01,360
Okay.

6903
03:13:02,340 --> 03:13:03,260
Wait, oh, that's you.

6904
03:13:04,980 --> 03:13:05,820
You're so far.

6905
03:13:07,360 --> 03:13:07,780
Oh.

6906
03:13:08,180 --> 03:13:09,000
Are they lying?

6907
03:13:09,580 --> 03:13:10,740
No, they are chasing.

6908
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:11,680
Far?

6909
03:13:12,040 --> 03:13:13,160
What the fuck?

6910
03:13:13,940 --> 03:13:15,340
They're chasing another team.

6911
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:16,000
They're still running.

6912
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:16,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

6913
03:13:16,840 --> 03:13:17,300
Enemy, enemy.

6914
03:13:21,480 --> 03:13:22,320
Almost hit.

6915
03:13:22,460 --> 03:13:22,740
Almost hit.

6916
03:13:22,740 --> 03:13:23,000
Almost hit.

6917
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:23,780
Almost hit.

6918
03:13:23,800 --> 03:13:24,980
Oh, I couldn't get him.

6919
03:13:25,340 --> 03:13:26,180
I'm gonna climb up.

6920
03:13:27,040 --> 03:13:27,640
Oh, fuck.

6921
03:13:31,220 --> 03:13:32,560
How did I climb up?

6922
03:13:33,120 --> 03:13:33,480
Okay.

6923
03:13:33,740 --> 03:13:34,620
I'm climbing up.

6924
03:13:35,560 --> 03:13:36,000
It's okay.

6925
03:13:36,220 --> 03:13:36,800
I'm gonna push this one.

6926
03:13:36,940 --> 03:13:37,200
I'm gonna push this one.

6927
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:37,580
Careful, careful.

6928
03:13:38,660 --> 03:13:40,300
Careful, you're by yourself, you're by yourself, Ditto.

6929
03:13:40,520 --> 03:13:40,880
Okay.

6930
03:13:41,460 --> 03:13:42,180
Almost keg.

6931
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:42,940
On the purple.

6932
03:13:43,100 --> 03:13:44,660
One team, one team here, one team here.

6933
03:13:44,660 --> 03:13:45,400
Cracked him, cracked him.

6934
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:46,120
I'm batting.

6935
03:13:48,160 --> 03:13:49,280
Just remember you're by yourself.

6936
03:13:49,360 --> 03:13:49,760
Almost keg, another one.

6937
03:13:50,340 --> 03:13:50,700
Okay.

6938
03:13:54,450 --> 03:13:55,150
Oh my god.

6939
03:13:55,150 --> 03:13:55,890
These guys are annoying.

6940
03:14:01,180 --> 03:14:02,160
I'm looking for you.

6941
03:14:02,200 --> 03:14:03,020
Oh, he's so low.

6942
03:14:03,400 --> 03:14:04,020
He's fresh.

6943
03:14:04,200 --> 03:14:05,180
Yeah, he's far from me.

6944
03:14:06,180 --> 03:14:06,860
Oh, nice.

6945
03:14:07,060 --> 03:14:07,760
Nice, nice, nice.

6946
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:08,460
Okay.

6947
03:14:08,460 --> 03:14:09,600
Oh, that's mad, mad game.

6948
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:11,820
Where did you, where did you kill him?

6949
03:14:13,300 --> 03:14:14,040
On my ping.

6950
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:15,400
Okay.

6951
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:16,120
I'm ulting.

6952
03:14:17,020 --> 03:14:17,420
Okay.

6953
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:19,940
Thank you for the Q.

6954
03:14:20,440 --> 03:14:21,260
I give you Q.

6955
03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:22,280
I don't see them.

6956
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:23,480
On me.

6957
03:14:24,820 --> 03:14:25,800
Okay, okay, okay.

6958
03:14:26,880 --> 03:14:27,780
He's low, he's low.

6959
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:27,920
He's low.

6960
03:14:28,740 --> 03:14:29,360
Oh, I might be dead.

6961
03:14:29,360 --> 03:14:30,000
Oh my god, he's so low.

6962
03:14:30,220 --> 03:14:30,680
I'm dead.

6963
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:31,340
I'm going back.

6964
03:14:31,380 --> 03:14:31,980
I'm backing up, backing up.

6965
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:32,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6966
03:14:32,700 --> 03:14:33,360
I can't, I can't.

6967
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:35,900
Over here.

6968
03:14:36,920 --> 03:14:37,640
I think they rez.

6969
03:14:37,740 --> 03:14:38,280
I think they rez.

6970
03:14:38,580 --> 03:14:38,840
Okay.

6971
03:14:38,840 --> 03:14:39,660
Yeah, they're laning so fast.

6972
03:14:39,800 --> 03:14:41,220
Yeah, because there's mad Maggie.

6973
03:14:42,520 --> 03:14:42,800
Why?

6974
03:14:42,880 --> 03:14:43,680
So low, so low, so low.

6975
03:14:44,360 --> 03:14:45,180
Yeah, I have to heal.

6976
03:14:45,300 --> 03:14:45,720
Nice, nice.

Nice, nice.

6978
03:14:46,320 --> 03:14:47,040
I have to heal.

6979
03:14:47,160 --> 03:14:47,820
I can't go.

6980
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:49,320
They might rez again.

6981
03:14:49,560 --> 03:14:49,840

6982
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:51,060

Oh, nice, nice, nice.

Nice, nice.

6986
03:14:55,340 --> 03:14:56,420
Maybe they ran away.

6987
03:14:56,420 --> 03:14:57,000
I think they ran.

6988
03:14:57,300 --> 03:14:57,580
Yeah.

6989
03:15:01,960 --> 03:15:04,040
All right, we rob him.

6990
03:15:05,100 --> 03:15:05,840
Nice one.

6991
03:15:05,960 --> 03:15:06,500
Good food.

6992
03:15:08,380 --> 03:15:08,820
Delicious.

6993
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:11,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6994
03:15:11,800 --> 03:15:12,540
We should go.

6995
03:15:12,620 --> 03:15:12,920
Delicious.

6996
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:15,460
They are still fighting.

6997
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:17,540
In the tunnel.

6998
03:15:17,900 --> 03:15:18,300
They are?

6999
03:15:18,580 --> 03:15:18,960
Yeah.

7000
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:20,140
Oh, here?

7001
03:15:20,200 --> 03:15:20,660
Oh, okay.

7002
03:15:20,780 --> 03:15:20,960
In the tunnel.

7003
03:15:21,600 --> 03:15:22,440
There's a team here.

7004
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:25,760
I'm going to go to the one that threw the crack.

7005
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:26,440
Solo, he's solo.

7006
03:15:26,780 --> 03:15:27,540
He's fresh, he's fresh.

7007
03:15:27,660 --> 03:15:28,400
He don't have armor.

7008
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:29,600
Oh, he's here.

7009
03:15:29,620 --> 03:15:30,780
Come over here.

7010
03:15:31,180 --> 03:15:32,260
Oh, hey, package.

7011
03:15:33,720 --> 03:15:35,120
Come on, where are you?

7012
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:35,640
Go, go.

7013
03:15:35,720 --> 03:15:36,560
I will leave it to you.

7014
03:15:37,700 --> 03:15:38,220
Let's go.

7015
03:15:38,380 --> 03:15:39,280
Come on, where are you?

7016
03:15:40,900 --> 03:15:41,960
He keeps running.

7017
03:15:42,240 --> 03:15:43,440
Faster, faster, faster.

7018
03:15:44,120 --> 03:15:46,220
Wait, he got the fucking wingman too?

7019
03:15:46,980 --> 03:15:47,500
Bitch.

7020
03:15:47,760 --> 03:15:48,760
Let's go, let's go.

7021
03:15:50,360 --> 03:15:51,140
He's solo.

7022
03:15:52,360 --> 03:15:53,480
Oh, my God.

7023
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:54,400
He's solo.

7024
03:15:54,680 --> 03:15:55,860
I'm so mad.

7025
03:15:57,160 --> 03:15:58,080
He lived.

7026
03:15:58,180 --> 03:15:58,620
Oh.

7027
03:15:58,920 --> 03:15:59,560
He fell.

7028
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:00,560
He fucking lives.

7029
03:16:01,240 --> 03:16:02,040
Enemy, enemy, enemy.

7030
03:16:02,760 --> 03:16:03,360
Enemy, enemy, enemy.

7031
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:03,860
Oh, yeah.

7032
03:16:04,080 --> 03:16:04,360
Yeah, yeah.

7033
03:16:04,360 --> 03:16:04,860
There are two.

7034
03:16:05,480 --> 03:16:06,000
There are two.

7035
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:06,220
I'm here.

7036
03:16:06,260 --> 03:16:06,480
I'm here.

7037
03:16:06,860 --> 03:16:07,140
Crash.

7038
03:16:07,140 --> 03:16:07,300
I'm here.

7039
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:08,300
Oh, here's Uto.

7040
03:16:08,300 --> 03:16:08,520
Crash.

7041
03:16:08,680 --> 03:16:09,100
Uto Crash.

7042
03:16:09,540 --> 03:16:10,080
I'm going to cover.

7043
03:16:10,200 --> 03:16:10,580
Oh, my God.

7044
03:16:11,140 --> 03:16:11,900
I'm going to try to cover.

7045
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:13,400
He's getting shot.

7046
03:16:13,440 --> 03:16:13,840
They're getting shot.

7047
03:16:13,880 --> 03:16:14,200
They're getting shot.

7048
03:16:15,600 --> 03:16:15,880
Okay.

7049
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:16,420
Try to cover.

7050
03:16:17,540 --> 03:16:18,220
Me too, me too.

7051
03:16:18,380 --> 03:16:18,720
I'm trying to cover too.

7052
03:16:18,720 --> 03:16:18,840
Hey, I'm covering.

7053
03:16:18,980 --> 03:16:19,240
I'm covering.

7054
03:16:19,240 --> 03:16:19,560
I'm covering.

7055
03:16:22,940 --> 03:16:23,940
Oh, I have to back up.

7056
03:16:24,020 --> 03:16:24,600
I can't help.

7057
03:16:24,620 --> 03:16:24,980
I can't one.

7058
03:16:25,460 --> 03:16:26,540
I have to back out.

7059
03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:27,260
I have to back out fully.

7060
03:16:28,600 --> 03:16:29,640
I will go too.

7061
03:16:29,800 --> 03:16:30,180
I will go too.

7062
03:16:30,400 --> 03:16:36,520
I can't help her.

7063
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:38,560
Because there is another team shooting at me.

7064
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:44,120
Another team there.

7065
03:16:44,260 --> 03:16:44,940
Only two.

7066
03:16:45,220 --> 03:16:46,200
They shot us.

7067
03:16:46,980 --> 03:16:48,260
We have to go high ground.

7068
03:16:48,740 --> 03:16:49,800
I have no bat.

7069
03:16:50,080 --> 03:16:50,820
I have bats.

7070
03:16:50,860 --> 03:16:51,160
I have bats.

7071
03:16:51,260 --> 03:16:52,200
Actually no.

7072
03:16:52,320 --> 03:16:53,020
That's my one bat.

7073
03:16:54,780 --> 03:16:55,760
Wait there is people here.

7074
03:16:55,840 --> 03:16:56,320
There is people here.

7075
03:16:57,580 --> 03:16:58,000
Here.

7076
03:17:00,340 --> 03:17:01,500
Wait what did I hear?

7077
03:17:02,640 --> 03:17:03,060
What?

7078
03:17:05,280 --> 03:17:06,180
Wait they are rising.

7079
03:17:06,300 --> 03:17:06,500
They are rising.

7080
03:17:06,700 --> 03:17:07,260
Below us.

7081
03:17:07,720 --> 03:17:08,140
Yeah.

7082
03:17:08,400 --> 03:17:08,860
Right here.

7083
03:17:09,080 --> 03:17:10,560
I will heal first.

7084
03:17:12,400 --> 03:17:14,960
I am going to make sure no team runs into us.

7085
03:17:18,540 --> 03:17:19,460
They have a point.

7086
03:17:19,580 --> 03:17:20,480
They have a point.

7087
03:17:20,780 --> 03:17:21,260
Yeah but...

7088
03:17:21,260 --> 03:17:24,640
I am going to check for...

7089
03:17:24,860 --> 03:17:25,640
There is two.

7090
03:17:25,820 --> 03:17:26,140
There is two.

7091
03:17:26,280 --> 03:17:26,700
There is two?

7092
03:17:26,920 --> 03:17:27,160
Okay.

7093
03:17:27,500 --> 03:17:28,860
I am going to...

7094
03:17:31,580 --> 03:17:32,220
Climbing up?

7095
03:17:32,960 --> 03:17:33,300
Yup.

7096
03:17:33,840 --> 03:17:35,180
I am climbing up.

7097
03:17:40,690 --> 03:17:41,170
Where?

7098
03:17:41,390 --> 03:17:41,770
Where are they?

7099
03:17:42,250 --> 03:17:43,550
I don't know.

7100
03:17:43,730 --> 03:17:44,610
I ulted.

7101
03:17:44,610 --> 03:17:44,810
Go on.

7102
03:17:44,910 --> 03:17:45,050
Go on.

7103
03:17:45,410 --> 03:17:46,390
God damn it.

7104
03:17:46,490 --> 03:17:47,230
My ult.

7105
03:17:48,550 --> 03:17:49,430
Oh my god.

7106
03:17:49,450 --> 03:17:49,930
They are so far.

7107
03:17:50,350 --> 03:17:52,110
They are so far.

7108
03:17:53,330 --> 03:17:54,290
I ulted.

7109
03:17:54,290 --> 03:17:55,030
I have a point.

7110
03:17:55,090 --> 03:17:55,570
Okay.

7111
03:17:56,090 --> 03:17:57,130
Oh my god.

7112
03:17:57,370 --> 03:17:57,750
My hammer point.

7113
03:17:58,150 --> 03:17:59,810
They are so fast.

7114
03:18:00,190 --> 03:18:00,590
Why?

7115
03:18:00,670 --> 03:18:01,450
Are you running?

7116
03:18:01,950 --> 03:18:02,190
Oh no.

7117
03:18:02,190 --> 03:18:03,230
I need heavy ammo.

7118
03:18:03,470 --> 03:18:04,070
I don't have one.

7119
03:18:04,270 --> 03:18:04,310
Okay.

7120
03:18:04,330 --> 03:18:04,810
Let's loot.

7121
03:18:04,950 --> 03:18:05,630
Let's loot.

7122
03:18:06,690 --> 03:18:07,370
Let's loot.

7123
03:18:07,370 --> 03:18:07,990
Oh my god.

7124
03:18:08,050 --> 03:18:09,590
We can't kill one.

7125
03:18:09,870 --> 03:18:11,390
I make like...

7126
03:18:11,390 --> 03:18:14,210
1000 damage but I have no kill.

7127
03:18:14,310 --> 03:18:14,610
Oh my god.

7128
03:18:15,490 --> 03:18:16,510
They keep lying.

7129
03:18:16,830 --> 03:18:17,150
I know.

7130
03:18:17,310 --> 03:18:18,210
Fucking bitch.

7131
03:18:18,790 --> 03:18:19,190
Okay.

7132
03:18:19,310 --> 03:18:19,770
In front of me.

7133
03:18:19,790 --> 03:18:20,070
In front of me.

7134
03:18:21,010 --> 03:18:21,410
Okay.

7135
03:18:21,470 --> 03:18:21,690
Okay.

7136
03:18:23,290 --> 03:18:23,930
Two teams.

7137
03:18:23,990 --> 03:18:24,230
Two teams.

7138
03:18:24,270 --> 03:18:24,550
Two teams.

7139
03:18:25,010 --> 03:18:25,410
Okay.

7140
03:18:25,490 --> 03:18:25,770
Be careful.

7141
03:18:25,870 --> 03:18:26,130
Be careful.

7142
03:18:26,130 --> 03:18:27,730
I'm gonna get some loot.

7143
03:18:28,030 --> 03:18:28,410
Yeah.

7144
03:18:33,190 --> 03:18:33,710
What?

7145
03:18:34,470 --> 03:18:35,810
Oh nice one.

7146
03:18:35,850 --> 03:18:36,030
Nice one.

7147
03:18:36,030 --> 03:18:37,230
There's another team here in front of me.

7148
03:18:38,830 --> 03:18:39,750
Oh my god.

7149
03:18:39,830 --> 03:18:41,550
I was trying to loot this guy.

7150
03:18:44,610 --> 03:18:45,810
That's fucking right.

7151
03:18:45,930 --> 03:18:47,010
You thought you could run.

7152
03:18:47,350 --> 03:18:48,350
Oh my god.

7153
03:18:48,370 --> 03:18:49,030
He's so rich.

7154
03:18:49,510 --> 03:18:50,330
Do you need heavy?

7155
03:18:50,970 --> 03:18:51,490
Yes.

7156
03:18:51,510 --> 03:18:51,710
A lot.

7157
03:18:51,710 --> 03:18:51,710
Yeah.

7158
03:18:51,830 --> 03:18:52,550
He's rich.

7159
03:18:57,480 --> 03:18:59,920
Actually I'm gonna grab the prowler.

7160
03:19:02,160 --> 03:19:02,820
Oh nice.

7161
03:19:02,900 --> 03:19:03,420
Nice kill.

7162
03:19:03,700 --> 03:19:04,080
Yeah.

7163
03:19:04,640 --> 03:19:05,020
Careful.

7164
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:05,360
Careful.

7165
03:19:06,300 --> 03:19:07,400
They have to come to us.

7166
03:19:07,400 --> 03:19:08,000
They have to come to us.

7167
03:19:08,140 --> 03:19:09,380
They're not in zone.

7168
03:19:11,080 --> 03:19:12,040
They're right below us.

7169
03:19:12,120 --> 03:19:12,740
I'm gonna shoot below.

7170
03:19:13,720 --> 03:19:14,100
Okay.

7171
03:19:15,300 --> 03:19:15,820
Right here.

7172
03:19:16,100 --> 03:19:16,640
Right here.

7173
03:19:16,700 --> 03:19:16,960
Right here.

7174
03:19:16,980 --> 03:19:17,140
Okay.

7175
03:19:17,620 --> 03:19:18,000
Okay.

7176
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:19,480
I'm gonna...

7177
03:19:19,480 --> 03:19:20,260
I'm right there.

7178
03:19:20,380 --> 03:19:21,040
Behind this rock.

7179
03:19:21,060 --> 03:19:21,640
Behind this rock.

7180
03:19:21,760 --> 03:19:21,900
Oh.

7181
03:19:24,460 --> 03:19:24,840
Wait.

7182
03:19:24,860 --> 03:19:25,980
His teammates are right here.

7183
03:19:27,240 --> 03:19:28,680
Is that the same team?

7184
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:32,360
Wait.

7185
03:19:33,300 --> 03:19:34,000
That's another team.

7186
03:19:34,700 --> 03:19:35,460
Oh shit.

7187
03:19:36,660 --> 03:19:36,980
Woooo.

03:19:37,840 --> 03:19:38,160
Yeah.

7189
03:19:38,220 --> 03:19:38,260
Yeah.

7190
03:19:38,280 --> 03:19:38,500
Careful.

7191
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:38,900
Careful.

7192
03:19:38,940 --> 03:19:39,160
Careful.

7193
03:19:39,280 --> 03:19:39,520
Nice.

7194

7198
03:19:41,300 --> 03:19:41,600
I got one.

7199
03:19:41,780 --> 03:19:41,820
Nice.

7200
03:19:41,820 --> 03:19:41,880
Careful.

7201
03:19:43,460 --> 03:19:44,260
They're not in zone.

7202
03:19:44,500 --> 03:19:45,300
I need to heal.

7203
03:19:45,420 --> 03:19:46,800
I only have small meds.

7204
03:19:47,260 --> 03:19:47,580
Okay.

7205
03:19:48,120 --> 03:19:49,500
Only small meds.

7206
03:19:53,260 --> 03:19:53,780
Crack one.

7207
03:19:53,980 --> 03:19:54,280
Oh.

7210
03:19:56,020 --> 03:19:56,580
You're gonna push?

7211
03:19:56,800 --> 03:19:56,960
Okay.

7212
03:19:59,180 --> 03:19:59,680
Oh my god.

7213
03:19:59,720 --> 03:20:00,080
Santa point.

7214
03:20:01,460 --> 03:20:01,880

7215
03:20:01,920 --> 03:20:02,180
I'm coming.

7216
03:20:02,280 --> 03:20:02,500
I'm coming.

7217
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:02,740
I'm coming.

7218
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:03,360

7219
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:03,560

Nice job.

7223
03:20:05,300 --> 03:20:05,300
Okay.

7224
03:20:05,300 --> 03:20:05,860
That's my ult.

7225
03:20:06,360 --> 03:20:06,860
Do you have Q?

7226
03:20:06,920 --> 03:20:07,260
Do you have Q?

7227
03:20:07,260 --> 03:20:07,560
Do you have Q?

7228
03:20:08,120 --> 03:20:08,440
Yeah.

7229
03:20:08,500 --> 03:20:08,680
Yeah.

7230
03:20:08,760 --> 03:20:09,020
Okay.

7231
03:20:09,660 --> 03:20:09,980
Oh.

7232
03:20:10,140 --> 03:20:10,660
I have Q.

7233
03:20:11,060 --> 03:20:11,380
Oh.

03:20:11,400 --> 03:20:11,500
Yeah.

7235
03:20:12,800 --> 03:20:13,340
Give me Q.

7236
03:20:14,380 --> 03:20:14,700
Crack.

7237
03:20:14,700 --> 03:20:14,900
Crack.

7238
03:20:14,960 --> 03:20:15,140
Crack.

7239
03:20:15,440 --> 03:20:15,760
No.

7240
03:20:18,880 --> 03:20:20,460
I need a bat.

7241
03:20:20,520 --> 03:20:20,920
I need a bat.

7242
03:20:25,150 --> 03:20:25,490
I'm good.

7243
03:20:25,590 --> 03:20:25,710
I'm good.

7244
03:20:26,730 --> 03:20:27,510
Do you thirst him?

7245
03:20:29,070 --> 03:20:29,830
I'm gonna thirst him.

7246
03:20:32,670 --> 03:20:33,530
Where's the hammer point?

7247
03:20:33,650 --> 03:20:34,150
Where is it?

7248
03:20:34,310 --> 03:20:34,610
Oh.

7249
03:20:34,630 --> 03:20:35,330
They are so poor.

7250
03:20:35,610 --> 03:20:36,570
They have no health.

7251
03:20:36,670 --> 03:20:36,710
Nothing.

7252
03:20:37,390 --> 03:20:38,090
They didn't have it.

7253
03:20:38,530 --> 03:20:39,330
What the point?

7254
03:20:39,950 --> 03:20:41,130
Where was it?

7255
03:20:41,250 --> 03:20:41,530
Oh.

7256
03:20:41,610 --> 03:20:42,330
We have to go.

7257
03:20:42,450 --> 03:20:43,170
We have to go.

7258
03:20:43,210 --> 03:20:44,570
Do you have redeploy or no?

7259
03:20:45,770 --> 03:20:46,510
I have.

7260
03:20:46,550 --> 03:20:47,130
I have hit here.

7261
03:20:48,130 --> 03:20:49,030
And then me here.

7262
03:20:49,270 --> 03:20:50,210
What was in that?

7263
03:20:50,250 --> 03:20:50,670
I don't remember.

7264
03:20:51,650 --> 03:20:52,090
Alright.

7265
03:20:52,090 --> 03:20:53,190
We have to go.

7266
03:20:53,450 --> 03:20:53,810
Wait.

7267
03:20:53,850 --> 03:20:55,330
We can actually go here.

7268
03:20:55,510 --> 03:20:55,910
Do you wanna go tunnels?

7269
03:20:56,170 --> 03:20:56,410
Yeah.

7270
03:20:57,650 --> 03:20:58,090
Okay.

7271
03:20:58,090 --> 03:20:58,530
Yeah.

7272
03:20:58,570 --> 03:20:59,630
We can go tunnels.

7273
03:20:59,750 --> 03:21:00,010
Tunnels.

7274
03:21:00,150 --> 03:21:00,510
Yeah.

7275
03:21:00,770 --> 03:21:01,210
Tunnel.

7276
03:21:04,030 --> 03:21:04,470
Alright.

7277
03:21:04,470 --> 03:21:05,190
Alright.

7278
03:21:05,430 --> 03:21:06,030
We should be.

7279
03:21:06,170 --> 03:21:06,970
One team near.

7280
03:21:07,950 --> 03:21:08,430
Yeah.

7281
03:21:08,430 --> 03:21:09,110
Let's just stay in tunnel.

7282
03:21:09,650 --> 03:21:10,130
Yeah.

7283
03:21:10,170 --> 03:21:10,270
Yeah.

7284
03:21:10,330 --> 03:21:10,410
Yeah.

7285
03:21:10,470 --> 03:21:14,930
I can't believe the guy we didn't kill was the one with the hammer point.

7286
03:21:15,050 --> 03:21:15,850
I'm so sad.

7287
03:21:17,790 --> 03:21:19,310
I'm so f**king sad.

7288
03:21:19,530 --> 03:21:19,970
Of course.

7289
03:21:21,530 --> 03:21:22,490
Of course.

7290
03:21:22,950 --> 03:21:23,730
I will look left.

7291
03:21:24,750 --> 03:21:25,230
Okay.

7292
03:21:25,230 --> 03:21:25,990
There is no one.

7293
03:21:26,210 --> 03:21:27,650
Maybe we can get...

7294
03:21:27,650 --> 03:21:29,690
Can we get above?

7295
03:21:30,110 --> 03:21:30,850
On top.

7296
03:21:30,890 --> 03:21:31,150
We can go here.

7297
03:21:31,970 --> 03:21:33,270
They are fighting each other.

7298
03:21:34,470 --> 03:21:34,650
Apparently.

7299
03:21:35,330 --> 03:21:36,390
But I have my Q.

7300
03:21:37,530 --> 03:21:38,610
I'm gonna scout.

7301
03:21:43,480 --> 03:21:43,960
One.

7302
03:21:43,960 --> 03:21:45,080
One fresh there.

7303
03:21:45,400 --> 03:21:47,520
And I wanna make sure we don't get flanked.

7304
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:50,120
Okay.

7305
03:21:54,620 --> 03:21:55,800
They have 2.

7306
03:21:55,920 --> 03:21:56,420
They have 2.

7307
03:21:56,740 --> 03:21:57,220
Okay.

7308
03:21:58,440 --> 03:22:00,120
Can you scan back here?

7309
03:22:00,600 --> 03:22:01,080
Yeah.

7310
03:22:01,080 --> 03:22:01,360
Yeah.

7311
03:22:01,540 --> 03:22:02,320
I knew it.

7312
03:22:02,420 --> 03:22:03,300
I knew there was people there.

7313
03:22:04,440 --> 03:22:04,920
Nice.

7314
03:22:06,600 --> 03:22:07,660
I think there was a fight there or something.

7315
03:22:09,240 --> 03:22:12,100
Okay, one, two, and another team.

7316
03:22:12,480 --> 03:22:14,020
I'm not sure where are they.

7317
03:22:14,020 --> 03:22:15,080
Someone here, I think.

7318
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:22,120
I don't have angle.

7319
03:22:22,140 --> 03:22:23,400
No angle.

7320
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:25,100
Okay, me too.

7321
03:22:25,180 --> 03:22:25,580
No angle.

7322
03:22:27,700 --> 03:22:31,100
You guys watch here, I will watch our back.

7323
03:22:32,020 --> 03:22:33,200
Oh my god.

7324
03:22:34,340 --> 03:22:35,400
Okay, I need a heal.

7325
03:22:36,600 --> 03:22:39,020
I want to make sure the team to my left doesn't push us.

7326
03:22:39,080 --> 03:22:40,080
Yeah, you make sure the team...

7327
03:22:40,080 --> 03:22:40,700
Yeah, solo here.

7328
03:22:45,100 --> 03:22:46,400
The guy has red armor.

7329
03:22:48,060 --> 03:22:48,460
Cracked.

7330
03:22:48,600 --> 03:22:49,000
Nice.

7331
03:22:49,380 --> 03:22:49,740
Nice.

7332
03:22:49,800 --> 03:22:50,280
We get the solo.

7333
03:22:50,400 --> 03:22:51,500
I heal the solo here.

7334
03:22:52,320 --> 03:22:53,260
Do you guys have light ammo?

7335
03:22:54,440 --> 03:22:55,060
No, no.

7336
03:22:55,360 --> 03:22:56,980
Does the solo have light?

7337
03:23:01,380 --> 03:23:02,540
Focus here, focus this guy.

7338
03:23:02,660 --> 03:23:03,200
By himself.

7339
03:23:03,400 --> 03:23:03,960
Behind this rock.

7340
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:04,940
I'm going back.

7341
03:23:05,240 --> 03:23:06,300
Yeah, someone...

7342
03:23:08,840 --> 03:23:10,280
Okay, this is really really close.

7343
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:10,400
I'm going to just...

7344
03:23:10,400 --> 03:23:10,900
Here, this guy.

7345
03:23:13,840 --> 03:23:15,540
Oh, I don't have a lot of ammo left.

7346
03:23:18,620 --> 03:23:20,460
I can't give you heavy ammo if you want.

7347
03:23:20,460 --> 03:23:20,820
This is not zone.

7348
03:23:21,740 --> 03:23:22,140
Okay.

7349
03:23:22,880 --> 03:23:23,780
Do you want heavy ammo?

7350
03:23:24,660 --> 03:23:25,460
Oh, okay.

7351
03:23:27,320 --> 03:23:28,300
Alright, never mind.

7352
03:23:28,520 --> 03:23:29,120
I can't shoot anymore.

7353
03:23:29,120 --> 03:23:29,640
I'm watching, I'm watching, I'm watching.

7354
03:23:30,120 --> 03:23:31,200
I can't shoot anymore.

7355
03:23:32,160 --> 03:23:35,700
We are still in zone, but this team is...

7356
03:23:35,700 --> 03:23:36,840
I only have short range.

7357
03:23:38,780 --> 03:23:39,700
Wait, they are resing.

7358
03:23:39,700 --> 03:23:39,920
What?

7359
03:23:39,980 --> 03:23:40,460
Hmm?

7360
03:23:41,340 --> 03:23:42,300
Who resed?

7361
03:23:44,140 --> 03:23:45,180
Maybe that team.

7362
03:23:45,940 --> 03:23:47,020
Oh, I guess so.

7363
03:23:47,260 --> 03:23:48,180
Oh, this team.

7364
03:23:48,260 --> 03:23:48,500
Yeah.

7365
03:23:53,160 --> 03:23:54,300
Oh my god.

7366
03:23:55,900 --> 03:23:56,380
Okay.

7367
03:23:56,500 --> 03:23:57,960
This team is in zone.

7368
03:23:58,240 --> 03:23:59,700
I don't want this team to push us.

7369
03:24:03,340 --> 03:24:04,340
I'm just gonna wait.

7370
03:24:06,400 --> 03:24:07,400
Oh my god.

7371
03:24:07,400 --> 03:24:07,920
I'm gonna wait.

7372
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:08,320
I don't...

7373
03:24:08,320 --> 03:24:09,240
I only have close range.

7374
03:24:11,620 --> 03:24:12,200
Oh yeah.

7375
03:24:12,200 --> 03:24:12,500
Okay.

7376
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:15,080
What are you using right now?

7377
03:24:15,800 --> 03:24:16,600
Carbine, Prowler.

7378
03:24:16,700 --> 03:24:18,400
I don't have Light, so I'll just... I have Prowler.

7379
03:24:19,540 --> 03:24:20,120
Careful, careful!

7380
03:24:20,840 --> 03:24:22,080
Here, I'll cover, I'll cover.

7381
03:24:23,620 --> 03:24:27,420
Oh, they're right below me.

7382
03:24:27,620 --> 03:24:28,780
They're Q'd below us.

7383
03:24:29,580 --> 03:24:29,980
Okay.

7384
03:24:30,100 --> 03:24:30,960
Be careful, they are...

7385
03:24:30,960 --> 03:24:31,760
He's...

7386
03:24:31,760 --> 03:24:32,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7387
03:24:36,440 --> 03:24:37,440
They're right below me.

7388
03:24:37,580 --> 03:24:38,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right here.

7389
03:24:43,830 --> 03:24:44,790
I'm looking at climb up.

7390
03:24:45,150 --> 03:24:46,750
I can't get any anger.

7391
03:24:47,670 --> 03:24:49,110
I'm making sure they don't climb up.

7392
03:24:49,310 --> 03:24:52,090
This team on our left, this team has to come to us.

7393
03:24:52,330 --> 03:24:53,830
Or this team has to rotate first.

7394
03:24:54,130 --> 03:24:56,190
Careful, Ditto, they might rush you.

7395
03:24:56,370 --> 03:24:56,890
Okay, okay, okay.

7396
03:24:57,590 --> 03:24:58,650
They might try and rush you.

7397
03:24:59,710 --> 03:25:02,450
I think we should be like a bit closer.

7398
03:25:02,730 --> 03:25:02,750
Let's go.

7399
03:25:03,650 --> 03:25:04,050
Yeah.

7400
03:25:05,910 --> 03:25:06,530
One o'clock.

7401
03:25:06,990 --> 03:25:07,390
Nice.

7402
03:25:08,690 --> 03:25:09,370
Come here, Gabri!

7403
03:25:10,910 --> 03:25:11,310
Here!

7404
03:25:12,550 --> 03:25:12,950
Ooh!

7405
03:25:13,510 --> 03:25:13,910
Here.

7406
03:25:14,850 --> 03:25:15,490
Careful, Ditto.

7407
03:25:19,940 --> 03:25:21,140
Yeah, don't let them push up.

7408
03:25:21,420 --> 03:25:22,200
Yeah, I'll throw that away.

7409
03:25:22,660 --> 03:25:23,020
Okay.

7410
03:25:23,240 --> 03:25:24,380
Just make force...

7411
03:25:24,380 --> 03:25:26,040
I won't force them to go this way.

7412
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:29,240
There's the one guy here.

7413
03:25:29,240 --> 03:25:30,120
Yeah, I'm looking at the portal.

7414
03:25:30,140 --> 03:25:31,460
I'm looking at the portal so they don't push.

7415
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:33,280
You all up, guys?

7416
03:25:34,920 --> 03:25:35,280
One...

7417
03:25:35,280 --> 03:25:35,940
One keg.

7418
03:25:36,820 --> 03:25:37,480
Can I zoom?

7419
03:25:37,620 --> 03:25:37,880
Can I?

7420
03:25:37,900 --> 03:25:38,060
Yeah.

7421
03:25:38,140 --> 03:25:38,720
Can you scan?

7422
03:25:38,900 --> 03:25:39,260
Yes, scan.

7423
03:25:41,640 --> 03:25:42,220
Yes, scan.

7424
03:25:43,940 --> 03:25:44,680
Can you scan?

7425
03:25:44,920 --> 03:25:46,020
I got the belt, I got the belt.

7426
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:47,080
Oh, okay.

7427
03:25:51,610 --> 03:25:51,970
I'm gonna go.

7428
03:25:51,990 --> 03:25:53,650
Oh, no, this is bad.

7429
03:25:53,690 --> 03:25:54,690
There's so many people on us.

7430
03:25:55,210 --> 03:25:56,010
Oh, my God!

7431
03:25:56,030 --> 03:25:57,490
There's a guy team above us!

7432
03:25:58,410 --> 03:25:59,970
I'm batting, I'm batting, I'm batting, I'm batting.

7433
03:26:00,030 --> 03:26:00,510
Oh, I'm sorry.

7434
03:26:00,570 --> 03:26:01,010
Careful, careful.

7435
03:26:01,170 --> 03:26:01,950
Play slow, play slow.

7436
03:26:03,010 --> 03:26:04,530
Oh, what the fuck?

7437
03:26:04,770 --> 03:26:05,130
No!

7438
03:26:06,450 --> 03:26:07,510
Oh, my God.

7439
03:26:07,850 --> 03:26:11,250
Wait, they all pushed us and he hit us.

7440
03:26:14,550 --> 03:26:15,270
Holy shit.

7441
03:26:16,910 --> 03:26:17,630
So close.

7442
03:26:17,950 --> 03:26:18,310
Yeah.

7443
03:26:18,470 --> 03:26:19,230
That was so close.

7444
03:26:19,350 --> 03:26:21,790
I thought they would push each other, but they put...

7445
03:26:21,790 --> 03:26:21,970
Oh, my God.

7446
03:26:21,970 --> 03:26:22,830
That was so close.

7447
03:26:22,830 --> 03:26:23,170
I didn't push.

7448
03:26:23,350 --> 03:26:24,010
They did.

7449
03:26:24,170 --> 03:26:27,870
They knocked like one, and then they like chilled.

7450
03:26:30,310 --> 03:26:32,090
They knocked one and chilled.

7451
03:26:32,090 --> 03:26:34,250
Yeah, they knocked one and was like, never mind.

7452
03:26:42,200 --> 03:26:42,980
Nice try.

7453

7457
03:26:54,220 --> 03:26:57,700
Eh, it just sucked that I had zero ammo on my other gun.

7458
03:26:58,920 --> 03:27:00,120
No ammo.

7459
03:27:00,680 --> 03:27:01,800

We can get champion.

7468

7470
03:27:24,080 --> 03:27:25,400
Champion number two, okay?

7471
03:27:25,400 --> 03:27:27,300
Yeah, no sleep until champion.

7472
03:27:28,940 --> 03:27:29,980
And then...

7473
03:27:29,980 --> 03:27:30,640
And then...

7474
03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:32,280

7475
03:27:33,060 --> 03:27:33,600

7476
03:27:33,860 --> 03:27:35,020
Oh, we sleep.

7477
03:27:35,240 --> 03:27:35,720
We go sleep.

7478
03:27:35,720 --> 03:27:36,280
Yeah, we go sleep.

7479
03:27:36,300 --> 03:27:37,420
We wake up and then...

7480
03:27:37,420 --> 03:27:37,500
No!

7481
03:27:37,520 --> 03:27:42,840
And then Uto's still playing and then we help her and then we get champion and then we go sleep again.

7482
03:27:43,080 --> 03:27:44,100
And then Uto...

7483
03:27:44,100 --> 03:27:48,880
And then Uto keeps going.

7484
03:27:51,380 --> 03:27:52,460
I'm tired.

7485
03:28:00,240 --> 03:28:01,480
Good luck, Uto.

7486
03:28:02,260 --> 03:28:03,020

7487
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:04,760
Good luck.

7488
03:28:04,880 --> 03:28:05,240

7489
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:07,800

7491
03:28:10,800 --> 03:28:11,620
No, no.

7492
03:28:11,700 --> 03:28:13,260
I'm so sleepy.

7493
03:28:13,380 --> 03:28:14,180
I'm so sleepy.

7494
03:28:14,420 --> 03:28:15,040

03:28:18,100 --> 03:28:19,540
I can't aim.

7498
03:28:19,540 --> 03:28:21,020
I can't aim anymore.

7499
03:28:21,020 --> 03:28:22,420
But Uto, you're not sleepy.

7500
03:28:22,740 --> 03:28:23,560
You're not sleepy.

7501
03:28:24,020 --> 03:28:24,300

Wait, what time?

7504
03:28:28,020 --> 03:28:28,260

03:28:55,780 --> 03:28:55,840
Don't let me die.

7519
03:28:57,360 --> 03:28:58,580

No team, no team.

7530
03:29:16,960 --> 03:29:17,760
Don't let me die.

7531
03:29:17,860 --> 03:29:18,800
I'll be very angry.

7532
03:29:20,340 --> 03:29:23,000
You won't like it when I'm angry.

7533
03:29:25,140 --> 03:29:26,080

03:32:59,700 --> 03:33:00,220
Okay.

7646
03:33:00,520 --> 03:33:01,180
Sky hook.

7647
03:33:01,220 --> 03:33:01,540
Sky hook.

7648
03:33:01,640 --> 03:33:02,000
Sky hook.

7649
03:33:02,120 --> 03:33:02,340
Yeah.

7650
03:33:08,550 --> 03:33:09,270
Finally here.

7651
03:33:09,450 --> 03:33:10,090
Another one.

7652
03:33:10,270 --> 03:33:10,590
I'm good.

7653
03:33:11,850 --> 03:33:12,210
Yoink.

7654
03:33:13,830 --> 03:33:14,190
Yoink.

7655
03:33:16,110 --> 03:33:16,590
Let's go.

7656
03:33:16,650 --> 03:33:16,830
Let's go.

7657
03:33:16,910 --> 03:33:17,530
From back.

7658
03:33:17,830 --> 03:33:18,110
Yeah.

7659
03:33:18,150 --> 03:33:18,510
Yeah.

7660
03:33:18,510 --> 03:33:18,630
Yeah.

7661
03:33:19,970 --> 03:33:20,830
They don't know.

7662
03:33:21,570 --> 03:33:22,350
They don't know.

7663
03:33:22,410 --> 03:33:23,430
They don't watch.

7664
03:33:23,690 --> 03:33:24,670
They don't watch their back.

7665
03:33:24,870 --> 03:33:25,010
Yeah.

7666
03:33:25,010 --> 03:33:25,270
Yeah.

7667
03:33:25,270 --> 03:33:25,410
Yeah.

7668
03:33:25,930 --> 03:33:26,830
They're so stupid.

7669
03:33:27,030 --> 03:33:27,370
Okay.

7670
03:33:27,430 --> 03:33:28,730
I'm gonna go from... Yeah.

7671
03:33:28,730 --> 03:33:29,570
You guys go from top.

7672
03:33:29,590 --> 03:33:30,350
I'll go from bottom.

7673
03:33:30,690 --> 03:33:31,050
Yeah.

7674
03:33:31,050 --> 03:33:31,150
You guys go from top.

7675
03:33:31,150 --> 03:33:31,150
I'll go from bottom.

7676
03:33:31,150 --> 03:33:33,010
Because you know when it's done, the door is open.

7677
03:33:34,170 --> 03:33:35,110
You two go top.

7678
03:33:36,510 --> 03:33:37,710
Also I wanna loot this too.

7679
03:33:38,750 --> 03:33:39,350
They don't know.

7680
03:33:39,410 --> 03:33:39,830
They don't know.

7681
03:33:40,190 --> 03:33:40,690
They don't know.

7682
03:33:40,790 --> 03:33:41,150
They don't know.

7683
03:33:41,230 --> 03:33:41,550
They don't know.

7684
03:33:41,610 --> 03:33:41,950
They don't know.

7685
03:33:41,990 --> 03:33:44,270
I'm gonna wait until it finishes.

7686
03:33:46,630 --> 03:33:47,510
Are you shooting?

7687
03:33:47,650 --> 03:33:48,150
Are you shooting them?

7688
03:33:48,990 --> 03:33:49,310
Yeah.

7689
03:33:49,330 --> 03:33:49,430
Yeah.

7690
03:33:49,490 --> 03:33:49,650
Yeah.

7691
03:33:50,630 --> 03:33:51,350
Another gun here.

7692
03:33:51,390 --> 03:33:51,910
Another gun here.

7693
03:33:53,790 --> 03:33:54,590
I cracked one.

7694
03:33:54,630 --> 03:33:55,030
I cracked one.

7695
03:33:57,390 --> 03:33:57,710
Wait.

7696
03:33:57,810 --> 03:33:58,170
Where are they?

7697
03:33:58,690 --> 03:34:00,130
I cracked two.

7698
03:34:00,210 --> 03:34:00,610
I cracked two.

7699
03:34:00,690 --> 03:34:00,990
Where?

7700
03:34:03,010 --> 03:34:04,410
Only one guy left?

7701
03:34:04,530 --> 03:34:05,490
Yeah, the last guy ran.

7702
03:34:05,890 --> 03:34:06,250
Woah!

7703
03:34:09,050 --> 03:34:09,570
Okay.

7704
03:34:09,770 --> 03:34:10,430
You good?

7705
03:34:10,450 --> 03:34:10,910
Give me a sec!

7706
03:34:11,270 --> 03:34:12,690
I'm fighting my demons!

7707
03:34:14,870 --> 03:34:16,770
I'm fighting my demons just now.

7708
03:34:17,370 --> 03:34:18,110
You good?

7709
03:34:18,430 --> 03:34:19,230
Yeah, I'm okay.

7710
03:34:20,030 --> 03:34:21,470
Oh look, all eyes.

7711
03:34:23,590 --> 03:34:24,990
I got only one kill.

7712
03:34:25,330 --> 03:34:27,890
Yeah, I got... yeah, the guy ran.

7713
03:34:29,610 --> 03:34:30,010
Scan?

7714
03:34:31,110 --> 03:34:32,750
Maybe they're leaving.

7715
03:34:33,390 --> 03:34:33,790
What?

7716
03:34:33,830 --> 03:34:34,210
She scanned?

7717
03:34:34,990 --> 03:34:36,410
Oh my... oh, there's a scan here.

7718
03:34:36,630 --> 03:34:37,110
No, I got two kills.

7719
03:34:38,530 --> 03:34:39,330
I'm gonna...

7720
03:34:39,330 --> 03:34:39,690
Enemy!

7721
03:34:39,870 --> 03:34:39,970
Enemy!

7722
03:34:40,170 --> 03:34:40,430
Here!

7723
03:34:42,310 --> 03:34:42,710
Where?

7724
03:34:42,890 --> 03:34:43,570
Oh yeah, there.

7725
03:34:43,710 --> 03:34:44,270
I'm coming over here.

7726
03:34:45,130 --> 03:34:46,130
Oh, no!

7727
03:34:46,670 --> 03:34:47,070
Careful!

7728
03:34:47,470 --> 03:34:48,290
Oh, wait a sec.

7729
03:34:49,270 --> 03:34:49,670
Careful.

7730
03:34:50,230 --> 03:34:51,310
I got the heal.

7731
03:34:51,350 --> 03:34:51,770
I got the heal.

7732
03:34:51,890 --> 03:34:52,050
Okay.

7733
03:34:53,530 --> 03:34:54,330
I'm trying...

7734
03:34:54,810 --> 03:34:55,730
Oh, I don't see.

7735
03:34:57,070 --> 03:34:57,870
I'm trying...

7736
03:34:57,890 --> 03:34:59,410
They run, I think.

7737
03:34:59,490 --> 03:35:00,010
Yeah, they run.

7738
03:35:00,110 --> 03:35:00,330
They run.

7739
03:35:01,470 --> 03:35:02,250
They're okay.

7740
03:35:05,410 --> 03:35:06,390
I want...

7741
03:35:07,850 --> 03:35:08,850
I got...

7742
03:35:08,850 --> 03:35:09,390
Heal!

7743
03:35:09,550 --> 03:35:10,290
We can...

7744
03:35:11,870 --> 03:35:13,430
We can redeploy.

7745
03:35:13,630 --> 03:35:14,430
Wanna redeploy?

7746
03:35:19,050 --> 03:35:19,550
Okay.

7747
03:35:19,730 --> 03:35:21,850
Okay, I'm gonna just redeploy.

7748
03:35:23,190 --> 03:35:23,690
Okay.

7749
03:35:23,830 --> 03:35:25,670
I know there was a scan.

7750
03:35:25,910 --> 03:35:27,330
There might be a team here, I think.

7751
03:35:28,110 --> 03:35:28,610
Okay.

7752
03:35:29,130 --> 03:35:30,250
Are you here first?

7753
03:35:30,410 --> 03:35:30,830
Okay.

7754
03:35:31,650 --> 03:35:32,210
Goodbye.

7755
03:35:32,790 --> 03:35:34,170
See you later.

7756
03:35:35,530 --> 03:35:36,090
Sayonara.

7757
03:35:38,390 --> 03:35:38,950
Sayonara.

7758
03:35:39,330 --> 03:35:39,890
Sayonara.

7759
03:35:42,030 --> 03:35:42,590
Goodbye.

7760
03:35:44,690 --> 03:35:45,850
Are you good there?

7761
03:35:46,210 --> 03:35:46,770
Yeah.

7762
03:35:46,810 --> 03:35:47,370
Safe, safe.

7763
03:35:47,810 --> 03:35:48,610
Okay, okay.

7764
03:35:48,850 --> 03:35:49,230
Let's save.

7765
03:35:53,450 --> 03:35:54,590
I want heal.

7766
03:35:54,970 --> 03:35:56,090
I want heal.

7767
03:35:56,550 --> 03:35:57,650
Wait, do I have med kit?

7768
03:35:57,770 --> 03:35:57,850
Oh!

7769
03:35:59,410 --> 03:36:01,770
I have the full heal for you.

7770
03:36:01,790 --> 03:36:01,910
Okay.

7771
03:36:01,970 --> 03:36:02,750
Do you need med kit?

7772
03:36:04,590 --> 03:36:05,570
I don't have it.

7773
03:36:05,650 --> 03:36:05,710
Here.

7774
03:36:05,890 --> 03:36:07,410
I'm using signage.

7775
03:36:07,950 --> 03:36:09,770
I have an extra med kit for you.

7776
03:36:10,690 --> 03:36:11,130
Okay.

7777
03:36:11,290 --> 03:36:12,530
There's a team here.

7778
03:36:12,790 --> 03:36:13,170
Enemy.

7779
03:36:14,030 --> 03:36:17,150
I don't know where they are, but I saw like a package come down.

7780
03:36:17,570 --> 03:36:18,730
Oh, we have to go to the zone.

7781
03:36:19,390 --> 03:36:19,830
Okay.

7782
03:36:19,910 --> 03:36:20,070
Okay.

7783
03:36:20,070 --> 03:36:21,470
I'm gonna run to the zone.

7784
03:36:21,750 --> 03:36:22,350
Careful, careful.

7785
03:36:22,730 --> 03:36:23,230
Okay, okay.

7786
03:36:23,530 --> 03:36:25,770
Maybe we can scan.

7787
03:36:26,190 --> 03:36:28,010
Scan the enemy first.

7788
03:36:28,090 --> 03:36:28,570
Yeah, yeah.

7789
03:36:28,910 --> 03:36:29,350
And locate.

7790
03:36:31,030 --> 03:36:31,470
Yeah.

7791
03:36:32,250 --> 03:36:32,730
Let's go.

7792
03:36:32,730 --> 03:36:33,070
Yeah.

7793
03:36:33,130 --> 03:36:33,290
Yeah.

7794
03:36:33,510 --> 03:36:33,990
Let's go.

7795
03:36:34,830 --> 03:36:35,230
Let's go.

7796
03:36:35,470 --> 03:36:35,850
Let's go.

7797
03:36:37,590 --> 03:36:38,230
Let's scan.

7798
03:36:38,530 --> 03:36:38,910
Okay.

7799
03:36:39,130 --> 03:36:39,510
Okay.

7800
03:36:40,930 --> 03:36:41,730
Oh my gosh.

7801
03:36:41,770 --> 03:36:44,910
I have so many heavy ammo.

7802
03:36:51,430 --> 03:36:53,350
Oh no, I'm not gonna cross.

7803
03:36:53,790 --> 03:36:54,290
I'm not gonna cross.

7804
03:36:54,290 --> 03:36:54,810
Oh shit.

7805
03:36:54,950 --> 03:36:56,450
Hey, there's two teams here.

7806
03:36:56,990 --> 03:36:58,430
I think we should go to zone.

7807
03:36:58,450 --> 03:36:59,050
We should go to zone.

7808
03:36:59,710 --> 03:37:00,530
Go to zone?

7809
03:37:00,630 --> 03:37:01,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7810
03:37:01,210 --> 03:37:01,530
Let's go.

7811
03:37:01,690 --> 03:37:01,930
Let's go.

7812
03:37:02,230 --> 03:37:02,610
Yeah.

7813
03:37:02,610 --> 03:37:02,850
Let's go.

7814
03:37:02,850 --> 03:37:02,870
Okay.

7815
03:37:02,870 --> 03:37:04,030
We might get here and here.

7816
03:37:04,630 --> 03:37:05,010
Yeah.

7817
03:37:05,010 --> 03:37:05,090
Yeah.

7818
03:37:10,970 --> 03:37:11,490
Nice.

7819
03:37:13,630 --> 03:37:15,610
I'm gonna head... get to high ground.

7820
03:37:16,570 --> 03:37:17,090
Okay.

7821
03:37:18,490 --> 03:37:19,630
One team down.

7822
03:37:19,630 --> 03:37:21,250
Yeah, there's two teams here.

7823
03:37:22,270 --> 03:37:23,750
Maybe we can play here?

7824
03:37:24,110 --> 03:37:25,070
Yeah, we play here.

7825
03:37:25,310 --> 03:37:25,530
Yeah.

7826
03:37:26,450 --> 03:37:27,230
Okay, okay.

7827
03:37:29,390 --> 03:37:30,250
Enemy here.

7828
03:37:31,110 --> 03:37:31,630
Okay.

7829
03:37:31,650 --> 03:37:32,150
One team.

7830
03:37:33,390 --> 03:37:33,910
Enemy.

7831
03:37:34,110 --> 03:37:34,690
Oh, no, no, no.

7832
03:37:35,730 --> 03:37:36,530
Oh, what?

7833
03:37:36,750 --> 03:37:37,490
How did they get here?

7834
03:37:37,830 --> 03:37:38,670
Don't look at me.

7835
03:37:38,690 --> 03:37:38,850
Don't look at me.

7836
03:37:38,870 --> 03:37:39,230
Don't look at me.

7837
03:37:39,310 --> 03:37:39,930
Don't look at me.

7838
03:37:40,590 --> 03:37:41,230
I'm climbing.

7839
03:37:41,670 --> 03:37:42,450
He didn't see me.

7840
03:37:42,570 --> 03:37:43,330
In front of me.

7841
03:37:43,410 --> 03:37:43,710
In front of me.

7842
03:37:44,890 --> 03:37:45,210
Flash.

7843
03:37:45,310 --> 03:37:45,450
Flash.

7844
03:37:45,510 --> 03:37:45,610
Flash.

7845
03:37:45,770 --> 03:37:46,090
Crack.

7846
03:37:46,130 --> 03:37:46,210
Crack.

7847
03:37:46,210 --> 03:37:46,390
Crack.

7848
03:37:46,390 --> 03:37:46,590
He's so low.

7849
03:37:46,670 --> 03:37:47,390
Oh shit!

7850
03:37:47,430 --> 03:37:47,970
He looked at me!

7851
03:37:48,610 --> 03:37:48,930
Crack.

7852
03:37:48,930 --> 03:37:49,170
Okay.

7853
03:37:49,230 --> 03:37:49,510
Crack.

7854
03:37:50,510 --> 03:37:51,150
I can't.

7855
03:37:51,250 --> 03:37:52,230
I can't do anything.

7856
03:37:52,270 --> 03:37:52,730
You have to heal.

7857
03:37:54,890 --> 03:37:55,650
I have to heal.

7858
03:37:56,910 --> 03:37:57,230
Careful.

7859
03:37:57,330 --> 03:37:58,670
There might be a team behind us.

7860
03:37:58,690 --> 03:37:59,050
Be careful.

7861
03:38:00,450 --> 03:38:00,770
Yeah.

7862
03:38:00,810 --> 03:38:01,430
Another squad shooting.

7863
03:38:04,210 --> 03:38:05,230
I'm gonna look behind us.

7864
03:38:05,390 --> 03:38:05,690
Yeah.

7865
03:38:05,750 --> 03:38:05,830
Yeah.

7866
03:38:05,830 --> 03:38:06,490
Team behind us.

7867
03:38:06,490 --> 03:38:07,070
Team behind us.

7868
03:38:08,610 --> 03:38:08,970
Okay.

7869
03:38:09,070 --> 03:38:09,590
I'm gonna cover.

7870
03:38:09,690 --> 03:38:10,110
I'm trying to cover.

7871
03:38:11,470 --> 03:38:11,830
Okay.

7872
03:38:12,790 --> 03:38:14,810
I'm trying to make sure they don't run to us.

7873
03:38:14,870 --> 03:38:16,750
I want them to go low ground.

7874
03:38:16,930 --> 03:38:17,030
Okay.

7875
03:38:17,050 --> 03:38:17,470
Be careful.

7876
03:38:17,610 --> 03:38:17,890
We can lose.

7877
03:38:17,890 --> 03:38:18,770
Oh my god!

7878
03:38:18,830 --> 03:38:19,730
There's so many teams!

7879
03:38:22,050 --> 03:38:23,190
I'm making sure this team...

7880
03:38:23,190 --> 03:38:27,510
We can get inside first if we... I think we don't have...

7881
03:38:28,150 --> 03:38:28,510
Careful.

7882
03:38:29,790 --> 03:38:30,150
Here.

7883
03:38:30,210 --> 03:38:30,650
I kept one.

7884
03:38:30,710 --> 03:38:30,870
Okay.

7885
03:38:31,310 --> 03:38:31,670
Two.

7886
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:32,030
Two there.

7887
03:38:32,070 --> 03:38:32,410
Two there.

7888
03:38:32,490 --> 03:38:33,110
Above us.

7889
03:38:34,310 --> 03:38:34,670
Okay.

7890
03:38:34,690 --> 03:38:35,670
I'm looking at the one...

7891
03:38:37,070 --> 03:38:38,050
Oh shit!

7892
03:38:39,630 --> 03:38:40,350
Goodbye!

7893
03:38:46,970 --> 03:38:48,010
I'm okay.

7894
03:38:48,550 --> 03:38:49,530
I'm okay.

7895
03:38:49,610 --> 03:38:50,030
I'm okay.

7896
03:38:51,790 --> 03:38:54,050
I walked backwards.

7897
03:38:54,690 --> 03:38:55,610
It's okay.

7898
03:38:56,790 --> 03:38:57,730
I'm okay.

7899
03:38:57,830 --> 03:38:58,170
I'm okay.

7900
03:38:58,770 --> 03:39:01,690
Nothing bad has happened to me.

7901
03:39:08,990 --> 03:39:14,130
I'm gonna try to smoke you.

7902
03:39:14,190 --> 03:39:15,570
Oh, we can't help you actually.

7903
03:39:15,710 --> 03:39:17,370
No, you're way too far.

7904
03:39:17,470 --> 03:39:19,450
Oh, that's another team!

7905
03:39:19,690 --> 03:39:20,590
That's so unlucky.

7906
03:39:20,870 --> 03:39:22,130
You're way too far from us.

7907
03:39:22,810 --> 03:39:23,370
Yes.

7908
03:39:24,730 --> 03:39:29,530
Yeah, I fell down and... I'm trying to get to you, but how?

7909
03:39:31,270 --> 03:39:32,490
Oh, they have A1-8.

7910
03:39:32,650 --> 03:39:33,050
Careful.

7911
03:39:33,330 --> 03:39:34,110
Yeah, I'm batting.

7912
03:39:34,490 --> 03:39:35,470
Wait, okay.

7913
03:39:36,830 --> 03:39:37,590
Do you have redeploy?

7914
03:39:37,830 --> 03:39:38,370
What the?

7915
03:39:38,430 --> 03:39:39,190
You have redeploy, right?

7916
03:39:41,730 --> 03:39:42,390
You are?

7917
03:39:43,350 --> 03:39:43,790
Okay!

7918
03:39:44,050 --> 03:39:45,350
Yeah, I want backup.

7919
03:39:45,510 --> 03:39:46,430
I want to back up.

7920
03:39:46,490 --> 03:39:47,110
They're gonna walk up.

7921
03:39:47,230 --> 03:39:47,970
There's three.

7922
03:39:55,730 --> 03:39:56,810
Yeah, that's them.

7923
03:39:58,130 --> 03:39:59,450
Oh, behind us!

7924
03:39:59,530 --> 03:39:59,690
Oh!

7925
03:40:00,950 --> 03:40:02,490
That's not good for us.

7926
03:40:03,190 --> 03:40:04,150
They might push.

7927
03:40:04,210 --> 03:40:04,770
Yeah, they're pushing.

7928
03:40:04,870 --> 03:40:05,110
They're pushing.

7929
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:05,830
Back up, back up.

7930
03:40:05,910 --> 03:40:06,610
Yeah, I might die.

7931
03:40:06,750 --> 03:40:07,330
Uto, you run.

7932
03:40:07,410 --> 03:40:07,630
Just run.

7933
03:40:07,650 --> 03:40:07,930
Just one.

7934
03:40:07,990 --> 03:40:08,630
I'll then run.

7935
03:40:08,830 --> 03:40:09,670
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

7936
03:40:10,110 --> 03:40:10,470
No!

7937
03:40:10,830 --> 03:40:11,190
No!

7938
03:40:11,890 --> 03:40:12,250
No!

7939
03:40:12,470 --> 03:40:12,470
Oh, no!

7940
03:40:13,510 --> 03:40:14,330
I should've...

7941
03:40:16,950 --> 03:40:17,530
I'm the enemy!

7942
03:40:17,530 --> 03:40:17,810
I'm the enemy!

7943
03:40:18,230 --> 03:40:18,590
No!

7944
03:40:19,610 --> 03:40:21,150
Two teams behind, and I need to get out of here.

7945
03:40:21,150 --> 03:40:21,170
Three!

7946
03:40:21,170 --> 03:40:21,510
Three!

7947
03:40:21,970 --> 03:40:22,330
Three!

7948
03:40:22,490 --> 03:40:22,890
Three team?

7949
03:40:23,910 --> 03:40:24,270
Three?

7950
03:40:24,270 --> 03:40:25,210
Oh my gosh.

7951
03:40:25,810 --> 03:40:26,170
Okay.

7952
03:40:28,370 --> 03:40:29,830
Goodbye, see you later.

7953
03:40:30,490 --> 03:40:30,850
Sayonara.

7954
03:40:33,310 --> 03:40:39,750
Goodbye, see you later.

7955
03:40:39,870 --> 03:40:40,270
Goodbye, see you later.

7956
03:40:40,270 --> 03:40:42,950
Goodbye, see you later.

7957
03:40:43,190 --> 03:40:43,190
Goodbye,

7958
03:40:48,160 --> 03:40:49,720
see you later.

7959
03:40:49,780 --> 03:40:50,880
Goodbye, see you later.

7960
03:40:51,200 --> 03:40:52,860
Goodbye, see you later.

7961
03:40:52,860 --> 03:40:53,280
Goodbye, see you later.

7962
03:40:53,280 --> 03:40:54,700
Goodbye, see you later.

7963
03:40:54,700 --> 03:40:55,820
Goodbye, see you later.

7964
03:40:55,820 --> 03:40:56,540
Goodbye, see you later.

7965
03:40:56,540 --> 03:40:57,780
Goodbye, see you later.

7966
03:40:57,780 --> 03:40:58,120
Goodbye, see you later.

7967
03:40:58,120 --> 03:40:58,860
Goodbye, see you later.

7968
03:40:59,060 --> 03:40:59,420
Goodbye,

7969
03:41:03,380 --> 03:41:03,380
see you later.

7970
03:41:05,480 --> 03:41:08,220
I got jinxed so hard.

7971
03:41:08,500 --> 03:41:12,480
If they don't know they are cheating, I'm going to use the bathroom.

7972
03:41:17,120 --> 03:41:17,840
Cheating.

7973
03:41:20,780 --> 03:41:22,680
Such good game sense.

7974
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:25,840
How did they know?

7975
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:27,520
Oh...

7976
03:41:32,200 --> 03:41:34,060
I'm gonna eat hamburger today.

7977
03:41:57,500 --> 03:41:58,960
Oh, black mushroom.

7978
03:41:59,000 --> 03:41:59,260
It's truffle.

7979
03:42:06,040 --> 03:42:07,600
In English?

7980
03:42:07,860 --> 03:42:08,980
In English, it's truffle.

7981
03:42:15,200 --> 03:42:15,980
Mushroom.

7982
03:42:22,260 --> 03:42:24,020
That's right, truffle.

7983
03:42:30,250 --> 03:42:30,730
Wow.

7984
03:42:33,070 --> 03:42:35,310
Doki, do you like truffle?

7985
03:42:38,730 --> 03:42:39,210
Huh?

7986
03:42:40,790 --> 03:42:41,750
One party.

7987
03:42:44,550 --> 03:42:45,190
She's dead.

7988
03:42:46,710 --> 03:42:47,330
Doki dead.

7989
03:42:49,090 --> 03:42:50,070
Oh, wake up.

7990
03:42:50,590 --> 03:42:51,730
Doki, wake up.

7991
03:42:53,530 --> 03:42:54,910
I found hammer point.

7992
03:42:55,150 --> 03:42:57,670
If you want hammer point, tell me.

7993
03:42:57,750 --> 03:42:58,150
Tell me.

7994
03:42:58,230 --> 03:42:58,570
Wake up.

7995
03:42:58,610 --> 03:42:58,950
Wake up.

7996
03:42:59,730 --> 03:43:00,170
Oh, she's...

7997
03:43:00,170 --> 03:43:00,950
She's dead.

7998
03:43:02,230 --> 03:43:02,990
Dead.

7999
03:43:03,450 --> 03:43:03,450
Dead.

8000
03:43:03,830 --> 03:43:04,590
Dead.

8001
03:43:08,710 --> 03:43:09,470
Assault.

8002
03:43:10,970 --> 03:43:12,190
Japanese time.

8003
03:43:14,830 --> 03:43:15,990
Japanese time.

8004
03:43:16,770 --> 03:43:17,770
Oh, no.

8005
03:43:17,770 --> 03:43:18,470
Where did she go?

8006
03:43:19,610 --> 03:43:20,810
Oh, no.

8007
03:43:20,850 --> 03:43:21,790
She's dead.

8008
03:43:21,830 --> 03:43:22,710
She's dead.

8009
03:43:24,590 --> 03:43:26,590
She'll come back later.

8010
03:43:26,590 --> 03:43:27,850
I think she's dead.

8011
03:43:28,010 --> 03:43:29,290
I'm back, but I crashed.

8012
03:43:29,610 --> 03:43:30,010
Oh, okay.

8013
03:43:30,230 --> 03:43:30,590
Okay.

8014
03:43:31,250 --> 03:43:31,830
I'm back.

8015
03:43:32,890 --> 03:43:33,370
Wait.

8016
03:43:34,910 --> 03:43:36,570
I have hammer point too.

8017
03:43:37,310 --> 03:43:39,110
Wait, there's enemy?

8018
03:43:40,010 --> 03:43:40,490
Enemy.

8019
03:43:40,590 --> 03:43:40,850
Enemy.

8020
03:43:42,290 --> 03:43:43,250
Here, R4D.

8021
03:43:44,070 --> 03:43:44,850
Okay, okay.

8022
03:43:44,910 --> 03:43:45,550
Protect me.

8023
03:43:46,130 --> 03:43:46,850
I'm important.

8024
03:43:47,390 --> 03:43:48,150
I'm protecting you.

8025
03:43:48,270 --> 03:43:50,310
Protect me.

8026
03:43:51,550 --> 03:43:52,450
One of us, okay?

8027
03:43:53,610 --> 03:43:55,030
I believe in all of you.

8028
03:43:57,170 --> 03:43:58,210
Oh, you guys can do it.

8029
03:43:58,910 --> 03:44:00,210
You're so good at the games.

8030
03:44:01,930 --> 03:44:02,550
Don't die.

8031
03:44:02,750 --> 03:44:03,730
I have no gun.

8032
03:44:05,990 --> 03:44:06,590
One K.

8033
03:44:08,170 --> 03:44:09,110
Okay, I'm coming back.

8034
03:44:10,090 --> 03:44:10,450
Okay.

8035
03:44:11,250 --> 03:44:11,750
I'm here.

8036
03:44:13,430 --> 03:44:15,130
Oh, my God, there's a god.

8037
03:44:19,740 --> 03:44:20,620
Where is it?

8038
03:44:22,480 --> 03:44:23,340
Where's the hammer?

8039
03:44:23,440 --> 03:44:24,300
Oh, my God, they are.

8040
03:44:25,420 --> 03:44:25,780
Yeah.

8041
03:44:25,780 --> 03:44:25,780
I'm coming up.

8042
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:27,140
So close, so close.

8043
03:44:30,220 --> 03:44:31,000
They're on the side.

8044
03:44:31,180 --> 03:44:32,200
They're coming over.

8045
03:44:33,100 --> 03:44:34,580
I'm gonna try and grab a gun.

8046
03:44:37,820 --> 03:44:39,500
Alright, triple sniper, let's go.

8047
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:41,240
Wait, what?

8048
03:44:41,440 --> 03:44:42,300
Wait, there's another...

8049
03:44:42,860 --> 03:44:45,060
Yeah, I'm getting shot by a different angle.

8050
03:44:46,120 --> 03:44:47,680
One guy, one guy so far.

8051
03:44:48,340 --> 03:44:48,760
Solo.

8052
03:44:50,360 --> 03:44:51,780
Oh, I'm going to...

8053
03:44:52,500 --> 03:44:53,560
Yeah, I'm going to Udo.

8054
03:44:54,700 --> 03:44:55,600
Nice, nice, where are you?

8055
03:44:57,080 --> 03:44:57,460
I'm here.

8056
03:44:57,980 --> 03:44:58,340
Nice!

8057
03:44:59,260 --> 03:44:59,940
Is there a safe?

8058
03:45:03,120 --> 03:45:04,700
Oh my god, please give me a different gun.

8059
03:45:05,180 --> 03:45:05,880
Oh, thank god.

8060
03:45:06,060 --> 03:45:06,280
Okay.

8061
03:45:07,280 --> 03:45:08,240
Above us, above us.

8062
03:45:10,980 --> 03:45:11,700
Above us.

8063
03:45:12,280 --> 03:45:13,320
Yeah, I'm going to... Okay, okay.

8064
03:45:14,080 --> 03:45:14,500
They're far.

8065
03:45:15,480 --> 03:45:16,180
They dropped down.

8066
03:45:16,260 --> 03:45:17,020
Not yet, not yet.

8067
03:45:19,880 --> 03:45:20,660
Oh, they scanned me?

8068
03:45:23,980 --> 03:45:24,540
I'm looking.

8069
03:45:24,900 --> 03:45:25,340
Scanned?

8070
03:45:26,880 --> 03:45:27,440
Crack one?

8071
03:45:28,440 --> 03:45:28,880
Nice.

8072
03:45:29,120 --> 03:45:29,760
Wait, on me?

8073
03:45:29,940 --> 03:45:30,960
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

8074
03:45:31,180 --> 03:45:31,600
Oh, shit.

8075
03:45:32,920 --> 03:45:33,580
Second floor.

8076
03:45:34,380 --> 03:45:35,200
One, one, one, one.

8077
03:45:37,420 --> 03:45:38,420
Where is he?

8078
03:45:39,240 --> 03:45:40,400
Nice, he was one.

8079
03:45:40,420 --> 03:45:40,720
Yeah, nice.

8080
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:41,480
Nice, nice.

8081
03:45:41,720 --> 03:45:42,180
I helped Ditto.

8082
03:45:42,320 --> 03:45:42,620
Nice!

8083
03:45:43,320 --> 03:45:43,760
Nice!

8084
03:45:44,340 --> 03:45:44,780
Nice!

8085
03:45:45,080 --> 03:45:45,580
Look at that.

8086
03:45:46,160 --> 03:45:47,860
Nothing to worry about.

8087
03:45:49,600 --> 03:45:50,860
Nothing to worry.

8088
03:45:51,140 --> 03:45:51,580
Easy, easy.

8089
03:45:52,180 --> 03:45:53,040
Easy, easy.

8090
03:45:53,040 --> 03:45:53,140
Easy.

8091
03:45:54,020 --> 03:45:54,460
Easy.

8092
03:45:55,080 --> 03:45:56,400
Oh my god.

8093
03:45:57,000 --> 03:45:57,980
I was not scared.

8094
03:45:59,180 --> 03:46:00,160
Wait, where's the helicopter?

8095
03:46:00,300 --> 03:46:00,700
Oh my god, nice.

8096
03:46:01,740 --> 03:46:02,380
Helicopter's here.

8097
03:46:03,500 --> 03:46:05,060
I saw it down here.

8098
03:46:05,320 --> 03:46:05,580
What?

8099
03:46:05,720 --> 03:46:06,620
Where did it go?

8100
03:46:07,280 --> 03:46:08,220
Oh, here, here, here.

8101
03:46:08,220 --> 03:46:08,860
Here, here, here, here.

8102
03:46:08,860 --> 03:46:09,580
Oh my god.

8103
03:46:09,620 --> 03:46:10,340
Okay, this is it.

8104
03:46:10,400 --> 03:46:11,020
This is it.

8105
03:46:11,640 --> 03:46:12,320
We win.

8106
03:46:12,720 --> 03:46:13,600
I'm healing up.

8107
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:14,280
Okay.

8108
03:46:14,640 --> 03:46:15,220
We win.

8109
03:46:16,080 --> 03:46:17,040
Do you have a gun?

8110
03:46:17,540 --> 03:46:18,500
There's a disruptor here.

8111
03:46:18,680 --> 03:46:20,480
Yeah, I have a vault and a flatline.

8112
03:46:21,180 --> 03:46:21,620
Okay.

8113
03:46:21,620 --> 03:46:24,360
Here, on R.E., R.E.

8114
03:46:24,360 --> 03:46:24,580
45.

8115
03:46:26,900 --> 03:46:27,700
Let's see.

8116
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:28,460
Okay.

8117
03:46:28,740 --> 03:46:30,420
Let me know you guys find a 30-30.

8118
03:46:31,160 --> 03:46:32,000
30-30 okay.

8119
03:46:32,300 --> 03:46:32,720
Yeah, yeah.

8120
03:46:35,400 --> 03:46:36,740
I'm going to loot the other side.

8121
03:46:37,800 --> 03:46:38,260
Okay.

8122
03:46:40,460 --> 03:46:44,200
I'm looking for a car or a parlor.

8123
03:46:45,840 --> 03:46:47,700
I need 30-30.

8124
03:46:48,980 --> 03:46:50,120
Parlor, oh there's a parlor there.

8125
03:46:50,120 --> 03:46:51,320
Oh, nice!

8126
03:46:53,720 --> 03:46:54,700
Boki present!

8127
03:46:55,460 --> 03:46:55,760
Oh!

8128
03:46:56,580 --> 03:46:58,240
There's a 3032!

8129
03:46:58,520 --> 03:46:59,420
Happy birthday!

8130
03:47:00,240 --> 03:47:02,080
Oh, I don't need it.

8131
03:47:02,080 --> 03:47:04,300
I found another one.

8132
03:47:05,520 --> 03:47:07,460
I'm returning your birthday present.

8133
03:47:10,440 --> 03:47:11,020
Yay!

8134
03:47:11,440 --> 03:47:12,480
Oh, I'm gonna head to zone.

8135
03:47:12,720 --> 03:47:13,960
I don't have enough meds.

8136
03:47:13,960 --> 03:47:14,820
I don't have meds.

8137
03:47:17,580 --> 03:47:19,020
Goodbye everybody.

8138
03:47:19,800 --> 03:47:20,180
No.

8139
03:47:20,320 --> 03:47:21,200
No prowler.

8140
03:47:23,140 --> 03:47:25,800
Nice, I found a DG2.

8141
03:47:26,240 --> 03:47:26,780
Here.

8142
03:47:28,280 --> 03:47:29,540
There's a lot of prowlers.

8143
03:47:30,280 --> 03:47:31,000
Okay.

8144
03:47:32,560 --> 03:47:37,260
Okay, we use prowler and iron 301.

8145
03:47:37,680 --> 03:47:39,420
Yeah, prowler 301 is alright.

8146
03:47:42,280 --> 03:47:43,520
I need...

8147
03:47:43,960 --> 03:47:44,920
A fucking scope.

8148
03:47:46,180 --> 03:47:48,780
2x or... 2, 3 or 2, 4.

8149
03:47:49,620 --> 03:47:49,980
Okay.

8150
03:47:52,000 --> 03:47:54,560
Where the fuck is the scope?

8151
03:48:01,440 --> 03:48:02,160
Hello?

8152
03:48:04,160 --> 03:48:05,120
I don't have prowler.

8153
03:48:05,980 --> 03:48:07,080
I don't have prowler.

8154
03:48:08,060 --> 03:48:09,360
Yeah, it's empty.

8155
03:48:11,020 --> 03:48:12,700
Still trying to find...

8156
03:48:12,700 --> 03:48:14,260
Trying to find a scope.

8157
03:48:14,940 --> 03:48:16,680
My 3030 is naked.

8158
03:48:18,140 --> 03:48:18,860
So...

8159
03:48:18,880 --> 03:48:19,300
So cold.

8160
03:48:23,510 --> 03:48:24,330
Okay.

8161
03:48:27,010 --> 03:48:27,830
Fragment?

8162
03:48:27,930 --> 03:48:28,390
Okay.

8163
03:48:29,050 --> 03:48:29,590
Fragment.

8164
03:48:29,590 --> 03:48:29,850
Okay.

8165
03:48:30,250 --> 03:48:31,070
Okay.

8166
03:48:31,870 --> 03:48:34,210
Oh, nice.

8167
03:48:34,710 --> 03:48:35,630
Nice one.

8168
03:48:35,870 --> 03:48:37,610
Okay, I'm gonna go to fragment.

8169
03:48:41,490 --> 03:48:42,310
Alright.

8170
03:48:44,050 --> 03:48:45,710
I go to fragment.

8171
03:48:47,160 --> 03:48:47,990
With my...

8172
03:48:47,990 --> 03:48:50,990
My 3030 is not naked anymore.

8173
03:48:51,610 --> 03:48:52,710
Oh, I need...

8174
03:48:52,710 --> 03:48:53,850
Oh, nice.

8175
03:48:53,850 --> 03:48:54,550
Yeah, I needed that.

8176
03:48:59,250 --> 03:48:59,850
Hmm...

8177
03:48:59,850 --> 03:48:59,990
Hmm...

8178
03:48:59,990 --> 03:49:00,090
Hmm...

8179
03:49:00,850 --> 03:49:02,670
I don't hear gunshots anymore.

8180
03:49:04,990 --> 03:49:05,910
Me too.

8181
03:49:06,270 --> 03:49:06,330
Me too.

8182
03:49:06,750 --> 03:49:08,050
I feel like...

8183
03:49:09,010 --> 03:49:11,070
Do you guys need battery?

8184
03:49:11,370 --> 03:49:12,410
Nah, I have 5.

8185
03:49:12,430 --> 03:49:13,250
I have 5.

8186
03:49:13,670 --> 03:49:14,070
Okay.

8187
03:49:14,150 --> 03:49:14,330
Me too.

8188
03:49:14,570 --> 03:49:15,710
We're rich now.

8189
03:49:16,730 --> 03:49:18,430
We'll never be poor again!

8190
03:49:18,430 --> 03:49:19,630
Battery?

8191
03:49:20,210 --> 03:49:21,190
Yeah, you need battery?

8192
03:49:21,490 --> 03:49:22,230
Okay, I got it.

8193
03:49:22,330 --> 03:49:24,890
Thank you.

8194
03:49:26,140 --> 03:49:26,730
Thank you.

8195
03:49:28,410 --> 03:49:30,430
I will keep...

8196
03:49:30,430 --> 03:49:32,130
Where the f*** is this team?

8197
03:49:32,530 --> 03:49:34,670
I'm scared we're gonna run into a team.

8198
03:49:35,290 --> 03:49:36,030
Okay.

8199
03:49:36,350 --> 03:49:37,590
I'm so scared.

8200
03:49:38,310 --> 03:49:39,050
Yeah.

8201
03:49:39,670 --> 03:49:40,410
Okay.

8202
03:49:42,050 --> 03:49:43,570
I'll keep hiding down.

8203
03:49:44,550 --> 03:49:45,210
Oh!

8204
03:49:45,350 --> 03:49:47,350
Do we run?

8205
03:49:48,430 --> 03:49:49,470
Do we leave her?

8206
03:49:50,410 --> 03:49:51,790
Okay, we leave her.

8207
03:49:51,910 --> 03:49:52,390
We leave.

8208
03:49:53,530 --> 03:49:54,210
Sorry.

8209
03:49:55,910 --> 03:49:56,430
Goodbye.

8210
03:50:00,590 --> 03:50:01,270
Goodbye.

8211
03:50:02,250 --> 03:50:02,990
See ya.

8212
03:50:03,210 --> 03:50:04,650
See ya later.

8213
03:50:06,130 --> 03:50:07,030
See ya later.

8214
03:50:07,830 --> 03:50:08,350
Bye.

8215
03:50:09,370 --> 03:50:10,590
Here we go.

8216
03:50:12,070 --> 03:50:12,750
Skyhook?

8217
03:50:13,070 --> 03:50:13,890
Yeah, we can.

8218
03:50:14,930 --> 03:50:15,370
We can.

8219
03:50:15,370 --> 03:50:16,950
I'll meet you on the other side of Skyhook.

8220
03:50:17,250 --> 03:50:20,630
If one of us dies, the other can just craft this.

8221
03:50:21,290 --> 03:50:21,730
Okay.

8222
03:50:21,810 --> 03:50:23,910
I hope it's you so I can keep my hammerpoint.

8223
03:50:29,150 --> 03:50:30,410
I hope it's you so I can keep my hammerpoint.

8224
03:50:30,410 --> 03:50:30,630
Be you.

8225
03:50:30,830 --> 03:50:32,330
Who's gonna be the lucky one?

8226
03:50:32,850 --> 03:50:33,290
You.

8227
03:50:36,570 --> 03:50:37,990
Why would it be me?

8228
03:50:38,930 --> 03:50:40,230
Why would it be me?

8229
03:50:41,730 --> 03:50:43,190
Why would it be me?

8230
03:50:43,890 --> 03:50:45,430
Why would it be me?

8231
03:50:45,670 --> 03:50:46,730
Why would it be me?

8232
03:50:46,930 --> 03:50:48,330
I'll go craft, you go res.

8233
03:50:48,910 --> 03:50:49,430
Okay.

8234
03:50:50,250 --> 03:50:51,750
Seems like there's no one here.

8235
03:50:52,010 --> 03:50:54,130
I will go grab armor first.

8236
03:50:58,740 --> 03:50:59,600
Alright, got her.

8237
03:51:01,080 --> 03:51:02,000
Oh, we lucky!

8238
03:51:02,400 --> 03:51:03,580
We have good luck!

8239
03:51:03,820 --> 03:51:04,120
See?

8240
03:51:04,660 --> 03:51:05,600
It's Uto.

8241
03:51:05,840 --> 03:51:06,540
That's unlucky.

8242
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:08,720
What if I got killed by the laser?

8243
03:51:11,200 --> 03:51:11,720
Unlucky.

8244
03:51:11,720 --> 03:51:13,020
She is the unlucky one.

8245
03:51:16,100 --> 03:51:16,700
Nice!

8246
03:51:17,220 --> 03:51:17,680
See?

8247
03:51:17,880 --> 03:51:19,140
Nothing to worry about.

8248
03:51:19,640 --> 03:51:19,720
Thank you.

8249
03:51:20,220 --> 03:51:22,360
I think we should go here.

8250
03:51:25,260 --> 03:51:26,620
Okay, I have to...

8251
03:51:26,620 --> 03:51:28,020
...cover Uto first.

8252
03:51:28,980 --> 03:51:30,000
She'll be fine.

8253
03:51:31,320 --> 03:51:32,120
Okay, yeah.

8254
03:51:32,220 --> 03:51:33,540
You don't need to cover her.

8255
03:51:33,740 --> 03:51:34,480
She'll be okay.

8256
03:51:35,680 --> 03:51:36,700
She is strong.

8257
03:51:36,740 --> 03:51:37,660
She's a pro.

8258
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:39,180
Oh, you're right.

8259
03:51:41,280 --> 03:51:41,880
Hmm...

8260
03:51:44,560 --> 03:51:45,000
Hmm...

8261
03:51:45,000 --> 03:51:46,780
She has a power move.

8262
03:51:47,600 --> 03:51:49,120
Oh, you can scan this too.

8263
03:51:49,320 --> 03:51:50,540
You won't get shot at, Uto.

8264
03:51:50,600 --> 03:51:51,620
You're so lucky.

8265
03:51:54,760 --> 03:51:55,640
Okay, okay.

8266
03:51:56,100 --> 03:51:57,380
Uto, you can scan this.

8267
03:51:58,060 --> 03:51:58,740
Don't worry.

8268
03:51:58,860 --> 03:51:59,800
I'll stand in front.

8269
03:52:04,060 --> 03:52:05,060
Nice, nice, nice.

8270
03:52:05,380 --> 03:52:06,140
You're so lucky.

8271
03:52:07,380 --> 03:52:08,500
Oh, we're so lucky.

8272
03:52:09,080 --> 03:52:09,520
Yeah.

8273
03:52:11,740 --> 03:52:12,520
Is that you?

8274
03:52:12,660 --> 03:52:14,560
Okay, I was gonna be like, who is that?

8275
03:52:14,700 --> 03:52:14,920
Me!

8276
03:52:15,020 --> 03:52:15,200
Me!

8277
03:52:15,280 --> 03:52:15,420
Me!

8278
03:52:16,580 --> 03:52:17,140
Okay.

8279
03:52:17,860 --> 03:52:20,360
I'm gonna make sure no one... I'm looking this way.

8280
03:52:21,240 --> 03:52:21,800
Okay.

8281
03:52:23,160 --> 03:52:24,300
I really like...

8282
03:52:24,300 --> 03:52:25,440
Alright, Uto.

8283
03:52:25,640 --> 03:52:25,960
Scan.

8284
03:52:26,920 --> 03:52:27,660
I'm okay.

8285
03:52:29,960 --> 03:52:30,540
Don't worry.

8286
03:52:32,800 --> 03:52:34,100
Don't worry, I'm blocking you.

8287
03:52:35,380 --> 03:52:36,420
I'm blocking you.

8288
03:52:37,340 --> 03:52:37,860
Don't worry.

8289
03:52:38,060 --> 03:52:39,320
Oh, what the fuck?

8290
03:52:39,360 --> 03:52:39,700
Wait!

8291
03:52:39,820 --> 03:52:40,620
Go, go, go!

8292
03:52:40,620 --> 03:52:41,300
Go, go, go!

8293
03:52:42,700 --> 03:52:43,880
Go, go, go, go!

8294
03:52:45,720 --> 03:52:46,840
Uto, go kill him.

8295
03:52:53,000 --> 03:52:53,980
Uto, go kill.

8296
03:52:54,140 --> 03:52:55,320
We'll wait here.

8297
03:53:00,040 --> 03:53:00,680
Why not?

8298
03:53:01,680 --> 03:53:03,440
Yeah, we should.

8299
03:53:03,540 --> 03:53:05,900
I feel like everybody's gonna run here.

8300
03:53:06,200 --> 03:53:07,080
So we should go here.

8301
03:53:09,820 --> 03:53:10,540
That'll be fine.

8302
03:53:10,620 --> 03:53:11,040
Uto.

8303
03:53:13,260 --> 03:53:14,680
Can we go first?

8304
03:53:14,820 --> 03:53:15,700
Yeah, we should go now.

8305
03:53:16,060 --> 03:53:16,880
Okay, Uto.

8306
03:53:16,880 --> 03:53:17,280
Come, come.

8307
03:53:18,900 --> 03:53:19,380
Okay.

8308
03:53:26,120 --> 03:53:27,000
Okay, this place.

8309
03:53:27,120 --> 03:53:27,920
This place is free.

8310
03:53:28,320 --> 03:53:29,460
Yeah, it's so free.

8311
03:53:29,860 --> 03:53:32,900
Alright, you're gonna go high ground?

8312
03:53:33,180 --> 03:53:33,500
Okay.

8313
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:33,920
Oh wait!

8314
03:53:34,180 --> 03:53:35,900
Yeah, why the fuck am I going low ground?

8315
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:37,320
We can stay on high ground.

8316
03:53:41,480 --> 03:53:43,240
I'm a little silly right now.

8317
03:53:43,580 --> 03:53:44,460
Are we...

8318
03:53:45,160 --> 03:53:48,200
Are we gonna stay here or go inside the ring first?

8319
03:53:48,460 --> 03:53:51,240
I feel like... No, we can go stay up.

8320
03:53:51,320 --> 03:53:54,380
Because like no one's gonna contest us on our side.

8321
03:53:54,640 --> 03:53:55,840
I feel like.

8322
03:53:56,060 --> 03:53:57,240
Wait, who's...

8323
03:54:00,640 --> 03:54:02,060
Oh, there he is.

8324
03:54:03,260 --> 03:54:04,220
Where's the solo?

8325
03:54:05,360 --> 03:54:06,040
On me.

8326
03:54:07,140 --> 03:54:08,120
Wait, he's gonna rez.

8327
03:54:12,020 --> 03:54:12,840
He's solo.

8328
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:13,340
No!

8329
03:54:13,600 --> 03:54:14,680
He got it off!

8330
03:54:17,440 --> 03:54:19,000
The stupid solo!

8331
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:20,600
He actually got it off.

8332
03:54:21,300 --> 03:54:21,820
Okay.

8333
03:54:22,220 --> 03:54:23,280
I cracked him too.

8334
03:54:23,340 --> 03:54:25,560
He has to come to us.

8335
03:54:25,700 --> 03:54:26,400
Yeah, he does.

8336
03:54:26,680 --> 03:54:28,140
There's no cover here too.

8337
03:54:28,700 --> 03:54:30,280
There is actually, never mind.

8338
03:54:31,360 --> 03:54:31,880
Here.

8339
03:54:32,140 --> 03:54:33,100
He has one.

8340
03:54:33,300 --> 03:54:33,680
Two!

8341
03:54:33,680 --> 03:54:34,020
Two!

8342
03:54:34,100 --> 03:54:34,280
Two!

8343
03:54:34,720 --> 03:54:36,320
No, because we saw him as a solo, remember?

8344
03:54:37,620 --> 03:54:39,320
Wish I made Uto kill him.

8345
03:54:41,020 --> 03:54:41,540
Yeah!

8346
03:54:41,980 --> 03:54:42,920
I'm sorry.

8347
03:54:42,940 --> 03:54:43,880
I told you guys!

8348
03:54:44,680 --> 03:54:45,080
I didn't...

8349
03:54:46,660 --> 03:54:47,780
I knew it!

8350
03:54:47,800 --> 03:54:48,540
Oh, crack crack crack crack!

8351
03:54:49,000 --> 03:54:49,960
Can I horizon?

8352
03:54:50,360 --> 03:54:51,780
Behind the car.

8353
03:54:57,280 --> 03:54:58,400
Oh, so close.

8354
03:55:00,780 --> 03:55:02,180
They will get killed.

8355
03:55:02,600 --> 03:55:03,640
I don't think so.

8356
03:55:03,960 --> 03:55:05,120
No, they're safe here.

8357
03:55:06,280 --> 03:55:08,040
Okay, I will watch our back.

8358
03:55:08,040 --> 03:55:09,160
Yeah, you watch the other side.

8359
03:55:09,380 --> 03:55:11,120
I wanna make sure.

8360
03:55:11,680 --> 03:55:13,160
Yeah, we can just go here later.

8361
03:55:13,520 --> 03:55:15,360
I don't want this team to run on us.

8362
03:55:18,440 --> 03:55:19,760
Are you washed here?

8363
03:55:21,700 --> 03:55:23,580
I want them to leave us.

8364
03:55:24,420 --> 03:55:24,920
Okay.

8365
03:55:26,060 --> 03:55:27,000
Oh yeah, they're running.

8366
03:55:27,300 --> 03:55:29,020
Yeah, leave.

8367
03:55:29,780 --> 03:55:31,040
This is our territory.

8368
03:55:31,380 --> 03:55:31,960
Okay, I'm coming over.

8369
03:55:32,720 --> 03:55:34,060
How much is this hurt?

8370
03:55:34,080 --> 03:55:35,220
Let's go inside the lane.

8371
03:55:36,280 --> 03:55:37,840
This doesn't hurt too much.

8372
03:55:39,460 --> 03:55:40,180
I'm okay.

8373
03:55:41,080 --> 03:55:41,580
Okay.

8374
03:55:42,660 --> 03:55:43,480
Drop down.

8375
03:55:48,940 --> 03:55:49,600
Yay!

8376
03:55:50,980 --> 03:55:51,600
Wow!

8377
03:55:52,720 --> 03:55:55,400
I'm gonna make sure no team runs behind us.

8378
03:55:55,740 --> 03:55:56,400
Okay.

8379
03:55:56,660 --> 03:55:57,320
Oh no!

8380
03:55:57,480 --> 03:55:57,880
What?

8381
03:55:58,760 --> 03:55:59,420
What?

8382
03:56:01,980 --> 03:56:03,720
How did he change?

8383
03:56:04,180 --> 03:56:05,180
Okay, goodbye.

8384
03:56:05,440 --> 03:56:07,100
Oh my god!

8385
03:56:09,340 --> 03:56:10,980
What the heck?

8386
03:56:13,000 --> 03:56:13,660
Okay.

8387
03:56:13,660 --> 03:56:14,860
My key is waiting for me.

8388
03:56:15,140 --> 03:56:16,540
See you later.

8389
03:56:18,020 --> 03:56:19,240
Oh fuck!

8390
03:56:20,160 --> 03:56:20,840
Goodbye!

8391
03:56:24,820 --> 03:56:25,640
Let's see.

8392
03:56:25,800 --> 03:56:26,820
I'm trying to figure out...

8393
03:56:26,820 --> 03:56:27,800
What does this mean?

8394
03:56:29,800 --> 03:56:30,480
Goodbye.

8395
03:56:31,040 --> 03:56:31,720
Sayonara.

8396
03:56:31,720 --> 03:56:32,440
He was camping.

8397
03:56:34,700 --> 03:56:36,960
Maybe you can grab my...

8398
03:56:37,840 --> 03:56:38,520
No.

8399
03:56:38,800 --> 03:56:40,620
There is no way.

8400
03:56:41,140 --> 03:56:42,140
That's not good.

8401
03:56:42,580 --> 03:56:42,980
Yeah.

8402
03:56:44,020 --> 03:56:46,980
I don't think anybody can grab that.

8403
03:56:49,400 --> 03:56:50,520
Fuck this!

8404
03:56:50,900 --> 03:56:52,500
You should have stayed with us.

8405
03:56:52,540 --> 03:56:52,860
No.

8406
03:56:56,220 --> 03:56:58,080
You should have stayed with us.

8407
03:56:58,100 --> 03:56:59,040
I'm gonna spawn a beacon.

8408
03:56:59,060 --> 03:56:59,760
We can't.

8409
03:57:00,420 --> 03:57:00,980
Crap!

8410
03:57:02,940 --> 03:57:03,740
I'll smoke.

8411
03:57:04,380 --> 03:57:05,280
I smoked.

8412
03:57:06,280 --> 03:57:06,900
Go Uto!

8413
03:57:07,000 --> 03:57:07,200
Go!

8414
03:57:09,640 --> 03:57:10,340
Don't worry.

8415
03:57:10,500 --> 03:57:11,180
I'll save you.

8416
03:57:11,360 --> 03:57:11,600
Careful.

8417
03:57:11,640 --> 03:57:11,860
Careful.

8418
03:57:12,040 --> 03:57:12,440
Careful.

8419
03:57:13,220 --> 03:57:14,320
I smoked.

8420
03:57:14,460 --> 03:57:14,660
I smoked.

8421
03:57:16,860 --> 03:57:17,600
I smoked.

8422
03:57:17,940 --> 03:57:19,620
Oh, you're resing here.

8423
03:57:19,760 --> 03:57:19,980
Okay.

8424
03:57:20,040 --> 03:57:21,100
I didn't realize you have respawn.

8425
03:57:21,820 --> 03:57:22,760
One team.

8426
03:57:22,840 --> 03:57:23,340
One team.

8427
03:57:23,520 --> 03:57:25,780
One team have duel.

8428
03:57:26,840 --> 03:57:27,400
Okay.

8429
03:57:28,720 --> 03:57:30,240
This is safe?

8430
03:57:30,360 --> 03:57:30,860
Okay.

8431
03:57:30,900 --> 03:57:31,420
That's cool.

8432
03:57:31,960 --> 03:57:33,620
I didn't realize this was safe.

8433
03:57:34,040 --> 03:57:34,600
Yeah.

8434
03:57:34,620 --> 03:57:34,880
It's safe.

8435
03:57:37,760 --> 03:57:39,940
I'm gonna go kill that Bangalore.

8436
03:57:40,260 --> 03:57:42,960
I'm gonna go kill that Bangalore.

8437
03:57:42,960 --> 03:57:44,940
I don't think you're gonna be killing anybody.

8438
03:57:45,620 --> 03:57:46,340
Wait.

8439
03:57:47,420 --> 03:57:48,140
What?

8440
03:57:48,440 --> 03:57:48,560
Inside.

8441
03:57:48,560 --> 03:57:48,560
Inside.

8442
03:57:48,780 --> 03:57:49,500
Okay.

8443
03:57:49,760 --> 03:57:49,880
Okay.

8444
03:57:49,880 --> 03:57:50,040
Okay.

8445
03:57:50,040 --> 03:57:50,520
Ready?

8446
03:57:51,060 --> 03:57:51,640
Ready?

8447
03:57:51,800 --> 03:57:52,780
Three, two...

8448
03:57:52,780 --> 03:57:53,080
Okay.

8449
03:57:53,100 --> 03:57:53,300
Okay.

8450
03:57:54,120 --> 03:57:54,840
Nice!

8451
03:57:54,960 --> 03:57:55,680
Nice!

8452
03:58:00,790 --> 03:58:01,510
Nice!

8453
03:58:01,930 --> 03:58:01,930
Nice!

8454
03:58:01,930 --> 03:58:03,150
I shot you.

8455
03:58:03,250 --> 03:58:04,870
I shot you instead.

8456
03:58:05,490 --> 03:58:06,030
Oh my god.

8457
03:58:06,110 --> 03:58:07,050
Don't shot me.

8458
03:58:07,530 --> 03:58:09,030
Don't shoot me.

8459
03:58:09,210 --> 03:58:11,710
You scared me.

8460
03:58:12,770 --> 03:58:13,490
Okay.

8461
03:58:13,490 --> 03:58:14,930
We're fine.

8462
03:58:15,030 --> 03:58:16,430
I need...

8463
03:58:17,230 --> 03:58:17,570
Look.

8464
03:58:17,770 --> 03:58:17,930
See?

8465
03:58:18,030 --> 03:58:20,330
You're not baby anymore.

8466
03:58:20,830 --> 03:58:21,910
I'm not baby.

8467
03:58:21,990 --> 03:58:23,790
But I need sail and shield.

8468
03:58:24,090 --> 03:58:25,430
And a lot of things.

8469
03:58:26,110 --> 03:58:28,250
We got everything we need.

8470
03:58:28,550 --> 03:58:29,490
We're okay.

8471
03:58:30,150 --> 03:58:31,170
Oh, Kraber.

8472
03:58:31,330 --> 03:58:31,670
Careful.

8473
03:58:32,010 --> 03:58:32,570
I'm back.

8474
03:58:32,570 --> 03:58:32,870
I'm back.

8475
03:58:33,330 --> 03:58:35,850
Oh, shit.

8476
03:58:35,890 --> 03:58:37,310
We're not in zone, guys.

8477
03:58:38,950 --> 03:58:40,430
We're not in zone.

8478
03:58:40,450 --> 03:58:40,730
We're not in zone.

8479
03:58:40,730 --> 03:58:43,470
We're not in zone.

8480
03:58:43,470 --> 03:58:45,190
I don't think we can get it in time.

8481
03:58:46,230 --> 03:58:47,430
But I'm gonna try.

8482
03:58:47,730 --> 03:58:47,750
We can.

8483
03:58:47,790 --> 03:58:47,930
We can.

8484
03:58:48,690 --> 03:58:50,070
But where do we go?

8485
03:58:50,310 --> 03:58:50,990
I don't know.

8486
03:58:51,330 --> 03:58:52,230
I don't know.

8487
03:58:52,450 --> 03:58:53,230
How about now?

8488
03:58:56,750 --> 03:58:57,910
Go here first.

8489
03:58:58,250 --> 03:58:58,710
Go here first.

8490
03:58:59,110 --> 03:59:00,890
We can.

8491
03:59:01,010 --> 03:59:01,250
We can.

8492
03:59:01,330 --> 03:59:01,470
We can.

8493
03:59:09,430 --> 03:59:11,230
I can't upgrade my perk.

8494
03:59:11,390 --> 03:59:12,250
This game.

8495
03:59:15,950 --> 03:59:17,210
This is scary.

8496
03:59:20,530 --> 03:59:21,230
I'm gonna go here.

8497
03:59:21,550 --> 03:59:22,030
Okay.

8498
03:59:22,110 --> 03:59:22,850
You guys go.

8499
03:59:23,210 --> 03:59:23,930
Nice smoke.

8500
03:59:24,470 --> 03:59:24,990
Guys, nice.

8501
03:59:25,190 --> 03:59:25,450
Okay.

8502
03:59:29,190 --> 03:59:29,670
Woooo.

8503
03:59:31,350 --> 03:59:33,250
Hey, I'm good.

8504
03:59:33,330 --> 03:59:33,570
I'm good.

8505
03:59:33,610 --> 03:59:33,790
I'm good.

8506
03:59:34,230 --> 03:59:35,090
Oh my god.

8507
03:59:35,110 --> 03:59:36,090
I don't like this zone.

8508
03:59:36,730 --> 03:59:38,190
Oh, this is a...

8509
03:59:38,190 --> 03:59:39,030
Careful, careful.

8510
03:59:39,170 --> 03:59:39,950
Careful, guys.

8511
03:59:41,670 --> 03:59:42,530
Am I right?

8512
03:59:45,370 --> 03:59:45,850
Woah.

8513
03:59:46,550 --> 03:59:46,990
I got one.

8514
03:59:48,970 --> 03:59:49,290
Careful.

8515
03:59:49,290 --> 03:59:49,810
Right side.

8516
03:59:49,990 --> 03:59:50,490
Careful.

8517
03:59:50,670 --> 03:59:51,190
Look at right.

8518
03:59:53,090 --> 03:59:53,690
Okay.

8519
03:59:54,030 --> 03:59:56,410
I don't have nades.

8520
03:59:56,490 --> 03:59:57,090
I have no nades.

8521
03:59:59,550 --> 04:00:01,030
Why are you smoking me?

8522
04:00:01,310 --> 04:00:01,890
Kill them.

8523
04:00:03,210 --> 04:00:04,970
Oh, they died to me.

8524
04:00:13,580 --> 04:00:14,660
This is scary.

8525
04:00:16,720 --> 04:00:18,200
Oh my god.

8526
04:00:18,780 --> 04:00:19,580
Fuck off.

8527
04:00:19,580 --> 04:00:20,380
They got us gone.

8528
04:00:22,260 --> 04:00:23,180
Wow, wow, wow.

8529
04:00:23,820 --> 04:00:24,620
Fuck off.

8530
04:00:24,980 --> 04:00:25,340
Woooo.

8531
04:00:26,920 --> 04:00:27,760
Oh, KOTY.

8532
04:00:27,940 --> 04:00:28,760
Do you have ult?

8533
04:00:29,260 --> 04:00:29,580
No.

8534
04:00:29,660 --> 04:00:29,980
90.

8535
04:00:30,100 --> 04:00:30,340
90.

8536
04:00:31,220 --> 04:00:31,620
90%.

8537
04:00:31,620 --> 04:00:31,880
Okay.

8538
04:00:31,900 --> 04:00:33,520
I got the ult to them.

8539
04:00:33,680 --> 04:00:34,740
But I don't know how to ult this.

8540
04:00:34,760 --> 04:00:35,760
I think ult right.

8541
04:00:35,840 --> 04:00:37,160
Ult right so they don't run to us.

8542
04:00:37,880 --> 04:00:38,280
Okay.

8543
04:00:38,400 --> 04:00:39,480
Oh, they ult us.

8544
04:00:39,700 --> 04:00:40,200
They ult us.

8545
04:00:40,860 --> 04:00:41,260
Fine.

8546
04:00:42,400 --> 04:00:43,400
Can you smoke them?

8547
04:00:43,480 --> 04:00:44,040
Can you smoke them?

8548
04:00:44,260 --> 04:00:46,060
I smoked this area.

8549
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:46,880
Okay.

8550
04:00:47,280 --> 04:00:48,140
I'll just go here.

8551
04:00:48,160 --> 04:00:48,520
I have ult.

8552
04:00:48,540 --> 04:00:48,780
I have ult.

8553
04:00:48,800 --> 04:00:49,300
I'm ulting left.

8554
04:00:49,380 --> 04:00:49,800
I'm ulting left.

8555
04:00:50,300 --> 04:00:50,840
You ult right.

8556
04:00:50,880 --> 04:00:51,380
I'll ult left.

8557
04:00:52,220 --> 04:00:52,860
Say what?

8558
04:00:56,980 --> 04:00:57,820
Oh my god.

8559
04:00:57,860 --> 04:00:58,940
I should have ulted right.

8560
04:00:59,180 --> 04:01:01,040
I can't go.

8561
04:01:01,100 --> 04:01:01,460
I can't go.

8562
04:01:01,540 --> 04:01:01,920
My ult.

8563
04:01:01,980 --> 04:01:02,180
My ult.

8564
04:01:02,360 --> 04:01:03,500
I can't run.

8565
04:01:04,020 --> 04:01:05,400
I'm not going on the left side.

8566
04:01:06,580 --> 04:01:07,320
Oh my god.

8567
04:01:08,040 --> 04:01:08,460
I'm fucked.

8568
04:01:08,520 --> 04:01:08,880
I'm fucked.

8569
04:01:08,900 --> 04:01:09,180
I'm fucked.

8570
04:01:09,260 --> 04:01:09,560
I'm dead.

8571
04:01:09,640 --> 04:01:09,860
I'm dead.

8572
04:01:10,720 --> 04:01:11,660
You're not gonna die.

8573
04:01:11,760 --> 04:01:12,360
You're not gonna die.

8574
04:01:12,560 --> 04:01:12,880
Really?

8575
04:01:12,940 --> 04:01:13,620
I feel dead.

8576
04:01:13,840 --> 04:01:14,060
Believe.

8577
04:01:14,060 --> 04:01:14,100
Believe.

8578
04:01:14,160 --> 04:01:14,360
Believe.

8579
04:01:16,980 --> 04:01:17,260
Okay.

8580
04:01:17,360 --> 04:01:17,680
I believe.

8581
04:01:17,820 --> 04:01:18,160
You're surviving.

8582
04:01:19,180 --> 04:01:19,640
To my right.

8583
04:01:19,660 --> 04:01:19,920
To my right.

8584
04:01:19,960 --> 04:01:20,120
Careful.

8585
04:01:20,220 --> 04:01:20,540
To my right.

8586
04:01:20,600 --> 04:01:20,900
To my right.

8587
04:01:20,940 --> 04:01:21,240
To my right.

8588
04:01:21,340 --> 04:01:21,960
I knocked one.

8589
04:01:21,960 --> 04:01:22,380
I knocked one.

8590
04:01:22,420 --> 04:01:22,740
I knocked one.

8591
04:01:23,280 --> 04:01:24,300
Let me know who you cracked.

8592
04:01:26,480 --> 04:01:26,760
What?

8593
04:01:26,760 --> 04:01:27,440
They're over here.

8594
04:01:28,820 --> 04:01:29,100
Careful.

8595
04:01:29,180 --> 04:01:29,320
Careful.

8596
04:01:29,440 --> 04:01:29,600
Careful.

8597
04:01:29,600 --> 04:01:29,780
Careful.

8598
04:01:29,840 --> 04:01:29,960
Careful.

8599
04:01:32,400 --> 04:01:32,680
Nice.

8600
04:01:34,020 --> 04:01:34,860

8601
04:01:37,360 --> 04:01:37,640

8602
04:01:37,680 --> 04:01:37,840
Low.

8603
04:01:37,880 --> 04:01:38,020
Low.

8604
04:01:38,120 --> 04:01:38,120
Low.

8605
04:01:39,000 --> 04:01:39,280
Nice.

8606
04:01:39,900 --> 04:01:40,360
Armor swap.

8607
04:01:40,400 --> 04:01:40,680
Armor swap.

8608
04:01:40,740 --> 04:01:40,980
Armor swap.

8609
04:01:41,700 --> 04:01:42,340
Just armor swap.

8610
04:01:42,400 --> 04:01:42,800
Don't mind me.

8611
04:01:44,180 --> 04:01:44,720
Last two teams.

8612
04:01:44,800 --> 04:01:45,180
Last team.

8613
04:01:45,200 --> 04:01:45,500
Last team.

8614
04:01:46,060 --> 04:01:46,900
I'm covering.

8615
04:01:47,820 --> 04:01:48,600
Oh my god.

8616
04:01:48,600 --> 04:01:49,160
Oh the Quaver.

8617
04:01:49,160 --> 04:01:49,580
Oh the Quaver.

8618
04:01:52,880 --> 04:01:54,720
I didn't believe.

8619
04:01:55,160 --> 04:01:55,620
I didn't believe.

8620
04:01:55,620 --> 04:01:56,900
That full head wingy.

8621
04:01:56,960 --> 04:01:57,700
Oh my.

8622
04:01:57,740 --> 04:01:59,600
What the fuck happened?

8623
04:01:59,600 --> 04:02:01,320
I got Quavered.

8624
04:02:01,320 --> 04:02:04,560
And then that wingman headshot.

8625
04:02:04,620 --> 04:02:04,680
And then that wingman headshot.

8626
04:02:04,680 --> 04:02:08,140
I got shut down so hard.

8627
04:02:08,580 --> 04:02:08,700
I got shut down so hard.

8628
04:02:09,220 --> 04:02:10,200
Oh my god.

8629
04:02:10,700 --> 04:02:12,780
It's cause I didn't believe.

8630
04:02:12,780 --> 04:02:14,680
It's cause I didn't fucking believe.

8631
04:02:20,240 --> 04:02:22,340
Why did I stop believing?

8632
04:02:23,560 --> 04:02:25,560
You didn't believe so you died?

8633
04:02:25,900 --> 04:02:26,140
Yeah.

8634
04:02:26,320 --> 04:02:27,480
I didn't believe enough.

8635
04:02:27,780 --> 04:02:27,960
Oh my god.

8636
04:02:30,540 --> 04:02:31,180
Luminant.

8637
04:02:31,580 --> 04:02:33,400
I didn't believe hard enough.

8638
04:02:33,640 --> 04:02:34,820
My bad.

8639
04:02:36,000 --> 04:02:36,700
Nice try.

8640
04:02:36,940 --> 04:02:37,640
Nice try.

8641
04:02:37,900 --> 04:02:38,940
We did our best.

8642
04:02:40,720 --> 04:02:42,700
We tried our best.

8643
04:02:45,880 --> 04:02:46,460
Yeah.

8644
04:02:46,600 --> 04:02:46,940
Yeah.

8645
04:02:48,820 --> 04:02:49,400
Yeah.

8646
04:02:49,400 --> 04:02:49,400
Yeah.

8647
04:02:50,140 --> 04:02:50,720
Yeah.

8648
04:02:50,720 --> 04:02:50,720
Yeah.

8649
04:02:50,720 --> 04:02:51,420
Oh my god.

8650
04:02:51,560 --> 04:02:53,440
We were so close to champion.

8651
04:02:53,920 --> 04:02:56,960
And then all of them was like No fuck you.

8652
04:02:57,160 --> 04:02:58,160
No fuck you.

8653
04:02:59,840 --> 04:03:01,280
I should have ulted right.

8654
04:03:01,420 --> 04:03:02,560
I should have ulted right.

8655
04:03:05,080 --> 04:03:06,440
God damn it.

8656
04:03:20,040 --> 04:03:21,460
I should have ulted right.

8657
04:03:21,460 --> 04:03:21,720
I should have ulted right.

8658
04:03:21,720 --> 04:03:22,520
We were so close.

8659
04:03:23,080 --> 04:03:23,680
Yeah.

8660
04:03:23,740 --> 04:03:24,880
We were so close.

8661
04:03:27,340 --> 04:03:27,940
Champion.

8662
04:03:29,380 --> 04:03:29,980
Champion.

8663
04:03:30,160 --> 04:03:30,840
This game.

8664
04:03:31,400 --> 04:03:32,920
This game will be champion.

8665
04:03:33,300 --> 04:03:34,280
I believe.

8666
04:03:34,600 --> 04:03:35,400
Oh my god.

8667
04:03:35,440 --> 04:03:36,800
We've been playing for four hours.

8668
04:03:37,040 --> 04:03:37,960
Oh my god.

8669
04:03:38,320 --> 04:03:38,480
Really?

8670
04:03:38,900 --> 04:03:39,360
Yeah.

8671
04:03:40,720 --> 04:03:42,940
We've been playing for four hours.

8672
04:03:47,070 --> 04:03:48,270
Oh my god.

8673
04:03:48,990 --> 04:03:49,590
Bro.

8674
04:03:49,670 --> 04:03:50,530
Fuck those guys.

8675
04:03:54,470 --> 04:03:55,570
How dare they.

8676
04:03:56,370 --> 04:03:56,770
How dare they.

8677
04:03:56,770 --> 04:03:56,930
How dare they.

8678
04:03:57,710 --> 04:03:58,550
That's fucked up.

8679
04:03:58,690 --> 04:03:59,870
They won't let us sleep.

8680
04:04:01,310 --> 04:04:01,710
Yeah.

8681
04:04:03,510 --> 04:04:03,910
Right.

8682
04:04:04,870 --> 04:04:07,630
I wanna know why is this champion team.

8683
04:04:08,610 --> 04:04:09,690
Let's go land on them.

8684
04:04:09,890 --> 04:04:10,150
Yeah.

8685
04:04:10,230 --> 04:04:10,750
Where are you?

8686
04:04:11,510 --> 04:04:12,290
Where are you?

8687
04:04:13,390 --> 04:04:14,930
I'm gonna land on you and beat you up.

8688
04:04:15,070 --> 04:04:16,790
Come countdown.

8689
04:04:16,790 --> 04:04:16,930
Come countdown.

8690
04:04:25,360 --> 04:04:27,380
Oh my god.

8691
04:04:27,620 --> 04:04:28,100
Yeah.

8692
04:04:30,840 --> 04:04:32,140
That's fucking right.

8693
04:04:33,020 --> 04:04:34,300
Come to downtown.

8694
04:04:34,800 --> 04:04:35,960
Release fist.

8695
04:04:36,120 --> 04:04:36,900
Yes.

8696
04:04:41,800 --> 04:04:42,940
Nice one.

8697
04:04:43,200 --> 04:04:43,420
Oh.

8698
04:04:44,640 --> 04:04:45,700
Oh fuck.

8699
04:04:47,200 --> 04:04:48,380
What happened?

8700
04:04:48,720 --> 04:04:49,960
Oh you fell?

8701
04:04:51,640 --> 04:04:52,100
I did a lot.

8702
04:04:52,460 --> 04:04:53,060
Nice.

8703
04:04:59,370 --> 04:05:00,270
Oh wow.

8704
04:05:00,610 --> 04:05:01,970
Let me see the power.

8705
04:05:02,410 --> 04:05:04,050
This is a champion comp.

8706
04:05:04,050 --> 04:05:05,830
Oh that's a champion comp.

8707
04:05:06,230 --> 04:05:07,370
Right there.

8708
04:05:09,630 --> 04:05:10,910
I hear skyhook.

8709
04:05:11,550 --> 04:05:12,150
Skyhook.

8710
04:05:13,030 --> 04:05:14,550
I'm heading over to Utho.

8711
04:05:14,610 --> 04:05:16,270
I'm heading over to Utho.

8712
04:05:17,510 --> 04:05:18,110
Okay.

8713
04:05:21,790 --> 04:05:22,810
This is it.

8714
04:05:22,830 --> 04:05:23,730
This is the run.

8715
04:05:24,890 --> 04:05:26,270
This is it.

8716
04:05:32,310 --> 04:05:33,810
Do they push Utho?

8717
04:05:34,150 --> 04:05:34,770
No.

8718
04:05:34,850 --> 04:05:34,970
No.

8719
04:05:36,710 --> 04:05:38,250
She's just existing.

8720
04:05:40,330 --> 04:05:41,370
I push.

8721
04:05:41,850 --> 04:05:42,750
You push?

8722
04:05:43,950 --> 04:05:44,970
You push?

8723
04:05:45,130 --> 04:05:45,570
Okay go.

8724
04:05:46,090 --> 04:05:46,710
Go.

8725
04:05:48,430 --> 04:05:49,050
Yeah.

8726
04:05:52,170 --> 04:05:53,410
Let's go.

8727
04:05:54,410 --> 04:05:55,230
Let's go.

8728
04:05:56,010 --> 04:05:56,090
Let's go.

8729
04:05:57,290 --> 04:05:58,830
Okay battery one bad.

8730
04:05:59,110 --> 04:05:59,950
Oh I'll take that.

8731
04:06:01,310 --> 04:06:02,270
Alright go.

8732
04:06:02,990 --> 04:06:04,270
Go save Utho.

8733
04:06:04,290 --> 04:06:04,710
Fighting.

8734
04:06:04,870 --> 04:06:05,150
Fighting.

8735
04:06:05,270 --> 04:06:05,490
Fighting.

8736
04:06:05,550 --> 04:06:07,990
Yeah we have to go fast before they finish.

8737
04:06:08,770 --> 04:06:09,810
Go faster.

8738
04:06:10,490 --> 04:06:11,070
Yeah.

8739
04:06:11,130 --> 04:06:12,230
Utho go faster.

8740
04:06:12,750 --> 04:06:13,890
Utho go faster.

8741
04:06:14,130 --> 04:06:14,890
Go faster Utho.

8742
04:06:16,970 --> 04:06:18,590
Oh he's so low.

8743
04:06:19,430 --> 04:06:20,850
Why didn't you kill him?

8744
04:06:22,370 --> 04:06:25,670
If he's so low he should have been dead.

8745
04:06:27,270 --> 04:06:28,610
Wait where's the other team?

8746
04:06:28,610 --> 04:06:29,570
I make him low.

8747
04:06:30,110 --> 04:06:31,150
Is he down?

8748
04:06:34,700 --> 04:06:35,300
Low?

8749
04:06:35,540 --> 04:06:38,440
I hit 10 on him.

8750
04:06:38,880 --> 04:06:39,060
Okay.

8751
04:06:39,460 --> 04:06:41,860
I want to team that.

8752
04:06:42,360 --> 04:06:43,380
Yeah they ran.

8753
04:06:44,460 --> 04:06:46,360
They don't fight each other.

8754
04:06:46,500 --> 04:06:46,660
Why?

8755
04:06:46,760 --> 04:06:47,700
What the f**k?

8756
04:06:47,900 --> 04:06:48,700
Come on.

8757
04:06:49,260 --> 04:06:50,740
Just gun and run.

8758
04:06:51,480 --> 04:06:52,080
Yeah.

8759
04:06:54,980 --> 04:06:56,000
I think they're there.

8760
04:06:56,000 --> 04:06:57,060
Yeah they did.

8761
04:06:57,380 --> 04:06:58,960
They were so scared.

8762
04:07:00,380 --> 04:07:01,100
Oh wait.

8763
04:07:01,160 --> 04:07:01,760
Left side?

8764
04:07:01,900 --> 04:07:02,220
Here.

8765
04:07:04,820 --> 04:07:05,180
Yeah.

8766
04:07:06,940 --> 04:07:07,520
He's solo.

8767
04:07:07,860 --> 04:07:08,260
He's solo.

8768
04:07:09,860 --> 04:07:10,220
Teammate.

8769
04:07:10,280 --> 04:07:10,560
Teammate here.

8770
04:07:12,300 --> 04:07:12,780
Teammate low.

8771
04:07:12,820 --> 04:07:13,120
Teammate low.

8772
04:07:13,320 --> 04:07:13,920
I knocked him.

8773
04:07:13,980 --> 04:07:14,140
Knocked him.

8774
04:07:14,220 --> 04:07:14,320
Knocked him.

8775
04:07:14,440 --> 04:07:14,780
Go go go.

8776
04:07:15,080 --> 04:07:16,020
Nice one.

8777
04:07:17,800 --> 04:07:18,820
I can give you kill.

8778
04:07:22,700 --> 04:07:23,200
Can I?

8779
04:07:23,320 --> 04:07:23,840
Finish him.

8780
04:07:24,700 --> 04:07:25,320
Oh they ran.

8781
04:07:25,400 --> 04:07:25,660
They ran.

8782
04:07:25,680 --> 04:07:25,900
They ran.

8783
04:07:25,960 --> 04:07:26,060
They ran.

8784
04:07:27,560 --> 04:07:28,120
They ran.

8785
04:07:29,860 --> 04:07:30,340
Okay.

8786
04:07:32,380 --> 04:07:33,240
On the rooftop.

8787
04:07:33,600 --> 04:07:34,080
One more point.

8788
04:07:34,120 --> 04:07:34,620
One more point.

8789
04:07:35,800 --> 04:07:36,600
Have a point.

8790
04:07:36,740 --> 04:07:37,700
Okay give me a sec.

8791
04:07:37,820 --> 04:07:39,260
I'm gonna...

8792
04:07:39,260 --> 04:07:40,200
Oh you're Youtube too?

8793
04:07:40,360 --> 04:07:41,120
Hello Youtube.

8794
04:07:42,400 --> 04:07:43,340
Hello Youtube.

8795
04:07:43,380 --> 04:07:44,180
Hello Youtube!

8796
04:07:44,800 --> 04:07:45,280
Woops.

8797
04:07:46,640 --> 04:07:47,700
That scared me.

8798
04:07:48,140 --> 04:07:49,320
Be careful of all of us.

8799
04:07:49,740 --> 04:07:50,620
Oh wait.

8800
04:07:50,740 --> 04:07:51,220
What?

8801
04:07:51,380 --> 04:07:52,600
Yeah I saw him.

8802
04:07:53,140 --> 04:07:53,300
Can I?

8803
04:07:53,300 --> 04:07:54,440
Yeah yeah yeah I just saw him.

8804
04:07:57,920 --> 04:07:58,820
Okay, okay, okay.

8805
04:07:59,180 --> 04:08:00,400
I feel like we have to...

8806
04:08:05,520 --> 04:08:06,420
What are they?

8807
04:08:07,740 --> 04:08:09,000
Fighting each other, fighting each other.

8808
04:08:09,200 --> 04:08:09,620
We can...

8809
04:08:10,160 --> 04:08:11,960
We don't have to worry too much.

8810
04:08:14,200 --> 04:08:14,520
Flush?

8811
04:08:14,740 --> 04:08:15,500
On me, on me, on me!

8812
04:08:19,280 --> 04:08:19,880
Thank you.

8813
04:08:21,000 --> 04:08:21,860
On me, on me, on me!

8814
04:08:22,240 --> 04:08:23,120
I'm with you, I'm with you.

8815
04:08:23,400 --> 04:08:23,880
Oh no.

8816
04:08:23,920 --> 04:08:25,640
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

8817
04:08:26,240 --> 04:08:27,600
Here, here, here, here, here.

8818
04:08:27,700 --> 04:08:28,280
I got him.

8819
04:08:28,280 --> 04:08:28,840
Nice, nice.

8820
04:08:29,060 --> 04:08:29,680
Help, help, help.

8821
04:08:29,840 --> 04:08:30,600
Behind you, behind you.

8822
04:08:31,700 --> 04:08:32,060
Crack.

8823
04:08:36,230 --> 04:08:37,090
Kill yourself first.

8824
04:08:37,670 --> 04:08:38,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8825
04:08:38,910 --> 04:08:40,330
Nice, nice, nice.

8826
04:08:40,650 --> 04:08:41,010
Wait,

8827
04:08:44,090 --> 04:08:44,350
wait, wait.

8828
04:08:44,370 --> 04:08:44,710
Another team.

8829
04:08:45,670 --> 04:08:46,130
Yeah, yeah.

8830
04:08:46,130 --> 04:08:46,770
Another team, another team.

8831
04:08:47,310 --> 04:08:48,570
Armor swap, armor swap, armor swap.

8832
04:08:48,930 --> 04:08:49,670
Yeah, armor swap.

8833
04:08:54,500 --> 04:08:54,980
I'm healing.

8834
04:08:55,300 --> 04:08:56,160
Someone look at him.

8835
04:08:56,260 --> 04:08:57,140
Someone look at the door.

8836
04:08:57,180 --> 04:08:57,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8837
04:08:58,620 --> 04:08:59,220
I'm gonna heal.

8838
04:09:00,900 --> 04:09:01,620
I can't go.

8839
04:09:02,620 --> 04:09:03,680
What is going on?

8840
04:09:04,180 --> 04:09:05,260
I'm trying to get ammo.

8841
04:09:07,040 --> 04:09:07,840
First floor?

8842
04:09:08,040 --> 04:09:08,980
I'm on first floor?

8843
04:09:09,620 --> 04:09:10,140
Oh no.

8844
04:09:10,820 --> 04:09:12,980
Wait, where's his teammate?

8845
04:09:13,480 --> 04:09:14,840
Maybe run away, I think.

8846
04:09:14,920 --> 04:09:15,120
Oh.

8847
04:09:15,180 --> 04:09:15,620
Nice.

8848
04:09:15,620 --> 04:09:16,520
I don't have medikits.

8849
04:09:17,040 --> 04:09:19,220
I only have syringes.

8850
04:09:19,460 --> 04:09:20,760
Yeah, here's med.

8851
04:09:25,470 --> 04:09:26,570
Alright, nice.

8852
04:09:27,070 --> 04:09:27,650
Yay!

8853
04:09:27,870 --> 04:09:30,170
I will torch this one.

8854
04:09:32,110 --> 04:09:33,510
Hmm, gonna run.

8855
04:09:33,790 --> 04:09:34,110
He's here.

8856
04:09:38,930 --> 04:09:39,570
Let's see.

8857
04:09:39,730 --> 04:09:40,630
I'm running...

8858
04:09:40,630 --> 04:09:42,330
Carbine, crowd... oh, vault.

8859
04:09:45,190 --> 04:09:45,690
Okay.

8860
04:09:46,910 --> 04:09:47,730
Oh, shit!

8861
04:09:48,550 --> 04:09:49,650
They don't have...

8862
04:09:49,650 --> 04:09:51,230
They don't have a lot of stuff.

8863
04:09:51,950 --> 04:09:53,030
I can get energy.

8864
04:09:53,190 --> 04:09:54,010
Like 24.

8865
04:09:54,250 --> 04:09:55,410
I mean heavy, heavy.

8866
04:09:55,630 --> 04:09:56,030
Oh, heavy.

8867
04:09:56,250 --> 04:09:57,290
Yeah, no heavy.

8868
04:09:57,310 --> 04:09:57,690
They don't have heavy.

8869
04:10:00,350 --> 04:10:00,930
Let's go.

8870
04:10:01,130 --> 04:10:02,270
Let's go from left side.

8871
04:10:02,730 --> 04:10:03,510
Yeah, I'm good.

8872
04:10:03,510 --> 04:10:03,650
Oh.

8873
04:10:03,970 --> 04:10:04,530
Yeah.

8874
04:10:09,430 --> 04:10:11,110
We have to heal.

8875
04:10:11,650 --> 04:10:13,090
We have to heal.

8876
04:10:17,980 --> 04:10:18,540
Wow.

8877
04:10:19,520 --> 04:10:20,080
Nice.

8878
04:10:22,100 --> 04:10:23,260
We're so healthy.

8879
04:10:26,400 --> 04:10:27,680
No, my hammer point!

8880
04:10:27,780 --> 04:10:29,020
I don't know where the hammer point was.

8881
04:10:29,260 --> 04:10:30,100
I can't remember.

8882
04:10:32,940 --> 04:10:34,100
Uta found it.

8883
04:10:34,100 --> 04:10:35,960
Yeah, and then I didn't pick it up.

8884
04:10:36,000 --> 04:10:37,020
We're not getting champion.

8885
04:10:37,240 --> 04:10:37,540
No.

8886
04:10:38,040 --> 04:10:38,560
No.

8887
04:10:39,080 --> 04:10:40,140
We can.

8888
04:10:40,480 --> 04:10:41,380
We can.

8889
04:10:43,520 --> 04:10:44,300
I'm lazy.

8890
04:10:44,640 --> 04:10:46,140
I'll see you guys later.

8891
04:10:46,540 --> 04:10:46,660
No.

8892
04:10:48,440 --> 04:10:50,580
I don't wanna run anymore.

8893
04:10:50,980 --> 04:10:51,580
They're fighting there.

8894
04:10:51,820 --> 04:10:53,080
Careful, left side.

8895
04:10:53,340 --> 04:10:55,400
Oh, they won't see me.

8896
04:10:55,540 --> 04:10:55,900
Wait, wait.

8897
04:10:57,120 --> 04:10:59,780
Alright, if I die, you're welcome.

8898
04:11:00,820 --> 04:11:01,340
Okay.

8899
04:11:01,340 --> 04:11:03,520
If I die, we're lazy.

8900
04:11:03,920 --> 04:11:04,440
Yeah, yeah.

8901
04:11:04,520 --> 04:11:04,960
Exactly.

8902
04:11:06,260 --> 04:11:07,700
I don't have ult.

8903
04:11:08,240 --> 04:11:09,680
I'll give it to you.

8904
04:11:10,680 --> 04:11:11,300
What?

8905
04:11:12,660 --> 04:11:14,020
She doesn't have...

8906
04:11:14,020 --> 04:11:14,140
Help me!

8907
04:11:14,360 --> 04:11:15,340
Oh, no more meds?

8908
04:11:15,500 --> 04:11:15,720
Okay.

8909
04:11:17,220 --> 04:11:18,080
Thank you.

8910
04:11:18,900 --> 04:11:20,280
We should go...

8911
04:11:20,280 --> 04:11:21,380
Just go here.

8912
04:11:21,620 --> 04:11:23,380
We have to run before...

8913
04:11:23,380 --> 04:11:24,540
Because we don't have meds.

8914
04:11:25,640 --> 04:11:26,260
Okay.

8915
04:11:26,300 --> 04:11:27,600
I only have signage.

8916
04:11:28,200 --> 04:11:29,200
No battery.

8917
04:11:31,960 --> 04:11:32,900
I'm just running.

8918
04:11:34,160 --> 04:11:35,740
I only have three syringes left.

8919
04:11:37,260 --> 04:11:38,520
Make sure I have only two.

8920
04:11:39,140 --> 04:11:39,580
Make sure I have only two.

8921
04:11:39,580 --> 04:11:40,160
Someone died to ring.

8922
04:11:40,300 --> 04:11:42,300
We should go inside the lane.

8923
04:11:42,640 --> 04:11:42,980
Yeah, yeah.

8924
04:11:43,000 --> 04:11:43,520
That's what I'm trying.

8925
04:11:45,020 --> 04:11:45,460
Someone's...

8926
04:11:46,240 --> 04:11:46,680
Ignore.

8927
04:11:46,680 --> 04:11:47,120
Ignore.

8928
04:11:47,780 --> 04:11:48,940
Don't look at them.

8929
04:11:50,180 --> 04:11:51,080
Don't look at them.

8930
04:11:52,080 --> 04:11:52,960
Just run.

8931
04:11:54,720 --> 04:11:56,380
We don't have meds.

8932
04:11:56,540 --> 04:11:57,660
They also saw us.

8933
04:11:57,780 --> 04:11:58,980
Yeah, but they're not shooting.

8934
04:11:59,200 --> 04:12:00,780
So they're pretending they didn't see us.

8935
04:12:01,340 --> 04:12:03,060
That means they don't have loot.

8936
04:12:03,300 --> 04:12:05,060
Yeah, so we leave.

8937
04:12:05,440 --> 04:12:06,860
We don't have syringes.

8938
04:12:08,100 --> 04:12:08,740
Okay.

8939
04:12:09,200 --> 04:12:09,840
Okay.

8940
04:12:11,200 --> 04:12:13,380
I have three syringes.

8941
04:12:13,440 --> 04:12:14,440
Uto has zero.

8942
04:12:14,620 --> 04:12:15,980
But she's not going to live.

8943
04:12:16,580 --> 04:12:17,760
We fight with...

8944
04:12:17,760 --> 04:12:18,980
There's people here.

8945
04:12:19,920 --> 04:12:20,560
Run.

8946
04:12:21,740 --> 04:12:23,020
Go tunnel.

8947
04:12:24,680 --> 04:12:25,320
Yeah.

8948
04:12:26,460 --> 04:12:27,360
Go tunnel.

8949
04:12:27,360 --> 04:12:27,500
I don't know.

8950
04:12:29,840 --> 04:12:30,860
Alright, here we go.

8951
04:12:32,140 --> 04:12:32,880
Careful, careful.

8952
04:12:33,040 --> 04:12:34,280
That might be camping.

8953
04:12:36,340 --> 04:12:37,360
I need syringes.

8954
04:12:38,120 --> 04:12:39,360
Where are the syringes?

8955
04:12:40,440 --> 04:12:41,320
My syringes.

8956
04:12:45,750 --> 04:12:46,190
Nice.

8957
04:12:46,190 --> 04:12:46,550
No!

8958
04:12:46,730 --> 04:12:47,170
No!

8959
04:12:51,170 --> 04:12:52,430
I'm not going to take it.

8960
04:12:52,510 --> 04:12:53,350
I'm not going to take it.

8961
04:12:54,110 --> 04:12:54,810
I know.

8962
04:12:55,250 --> 04:12:56,710
I know you need it.

8963
04:12:57,890 --> 04:12:59,090
Oh, he got my side.

8964
04:12:59,630 --> 04:13:01,250
There's another syringe here.

8965
04:13:01,330 --> 04:13:01,890
Yeah, I'm good.

8966
04:13:01,970 --> 04:13:03,030
I have my syringes.

8967
04:13:03,310 --> 04:13:04,170
Uto needs it.

8968
04:13:04,790 --> 04:13:05,850
There's a team in front here.

8969
04:13:06,830 --> 04:13:07,470
Thank you.

8970
04:13:07,630 --> 04:13:07,850
Thank you.

8971
04:13:07,910 --> 04:13:08,270
Team in front.

8972
04:13:08,330 --> 04:13:08,650
Team in front.

8973
04:13:09,150 --> 04:13:09,310
Okay.

8974
04:13:12,630 --> 04:13:13,130
On me.

8975
04:13:13,170 --> 04:13:13,350
On me.

8976
04:13:13,350 --> 04:13:13,530
On me.

8977
04:13:15,470 --> 04:13:16,570
Okay, I will give you...

8978
04:13:17,050 --> 04:13:17,790
Oh, f**k.

8979
04:13:18,930 --> 04:13:19,630
Oh my god.

8980
04:13:19,950 --> 04:13:21,350
I'm going to give you...

8981
04:13:21,350 --> 04:13:22,270
I'm going to give you...

8982
04:13:23,210 --> 04:13:23,810
Here too.

8983
04:13:24,330 --> 04:13:24,650
Uto.

8984
04:13:25,710 --> 04:13:26,130
On me.

8985
04:13:29,110 --> 04:13:29,330
Okay.

8986
04:13:29,450 --> 04:13:30,090
Free kill.

8987
04:13:31,030 --> 04:13:32,110
Oh, free kill.

8988
04:13:32,230 --> 04:13:32,510
Nice.

8989
04:13:32,630 --> 04:13:33,070
Free kill.

8990
04:13:35,190 --> 04:13:35,630
Nice.

8991
04:13:35,630 --> 04:13:36,150
Free kill.

8992
04:13:38,850 --> 04:13:39,830
There's another party.

8993
04:13:39,910 --> 04:13:40,470
Another party.

8994
04:13:41,090 --> 04:13:42,230
So many parties.

8995
04:13:42,310 --> 04:13:42,490
They're here.

8996
04:13:44,290 --> 04:13:45,810
Have you go back to other back?

8997
04:13:45,950 --> 04:13:46,390
Yeah.

8998
04:13:46,390 --> 04:13:46,710
Yeah.

8999
04:13:46,710 --> 04:13:47,030
It's fine.

9000
04:13:47,150 --> 04:13:47,770
That's the one team.

9001
04:13:48,470 --> 04:13:48,870
Yeah.

9002
04:13:48,930 --> 04:13:49,090
Yeah.

9003
04:13:49,170 --> 04:13:49,170
Yeah.

9004
04:13:50,430 --> 04:13:51,790
They're like all the way there.

9005
04:13:51,930 --> 04:13:52,850
We can...

9006
04:13:54,190 --> 04:13:55,350
We can go forward.

9007
04:13:55,970 --> 04:13:56,410
Like...

9008
04:13:57,010 --> 04:13:57,870
Maybe go here?

9009
04:13:57,870 --> 04:13:57,990
Wait.

9010
04:13:57,990 --> 04:13:58,550
I hear...

9011
04:13:59,110 --> 04:13:59,490
Peacekeeper.

9012
04:14:00,710 --> 04:14:02,110
This is... This is zone.

9013
04:14:02,230 --> 04:14:02,550
This is zone.

9014
04:14:03,170 --> 04:14:03,690
Okay.

9015
04:14:03,810 --> 04:14:04,330
Let's...

9016
04:14:04,330 --> 04:14:04,930
Yeah.

9017
04:14:05,070 --> 04:14:05,650
Let's go there.

9018
04:14:06,270 --> 04:14:06,910
It's fine.

9019
04:14:08,510 --> 04:14:09,730
I love free kills.

9020
04:14:09,990 --> 04:14:10,130
Yeah.

9021
04:14:10,170 --> 04:14:12,350
They rez this guy and then left him to die.

9022
04:14:13,570 --> 04:14:14,990
He has no gun.

9023
04:14:15,150 --> 04:14:15,570
Wait.

9024
04:14:15,650 --> 04:14:16,890
He was actually AFK.

9025
04:14:17,170 --> 04:14:17,690
Wait.

9026
04:14:19,190 --> 04:14:19,710
Okay.

9027
04:14:19,850 --> 04:14:20,110
Okay.

9028
04:14:20,110 --> 04:14:20,150
Okay.

9029
04:14:20,150 --> 04:14:21,470
This man has zero guns.

9030
04:14:21,890 --> 04:14:22,090
Okay.

9031
04:14:22,370 --> 04:14:22,650
Okay.

9032
04:14:22,650 --> 04:14:22,650
Okay.

9033
04:14:22,650 --> 04:14:22,650
This man has zero guns.

9034
04:14:22,650 --> 04:14:23,330
How poor.

9035
04:14:23,670 --> 04:14:24,730
That poor man.

9036
04:14:25,190 --> 04:14:25,590
How poor.

9037
04:14:25,590 --> 04:14:25,590
That poor man.

9038
04:14:27,850 --> 04:14:29,210
Here's syringes.

9039
04:14:34,260 --> 04:14:34,940
Okay.

9040
04:14:35,080 --> 04:14:36,060
Nobody here.

9041
04:14:37,480 --> 04:14:38,160
Again?

9042
04:14:42,060 --> 04:14:43,160
Oh my gosh.

9043
04:14:43,300 --> 04:14:44,680
This is too far for me.

9044
04:14:45,060 --> 04:14:47,240
Check if... I'm gonna check if anyone...

9045
04:14:47,240 --> 04:14:48,420
Stop.

9046
04:14:48,880 --> 04:14:49,560
Okay.

9047
04:14:49,560 --> 04:14:49,920
Okay.

9048
04:14:49,920 --> 04:14:50,060
Stop.

9049
04:14:50,900 --> 04:14:53,020
We have... We gotta go.

9050
04:14:53,160 --> 04:14:54,220
We have to go.

9051
04:14:54,320 --> 04:14:54,580
Yeah.

9052
04:14:55,240 --> 04:14:55,920
Okay.

9053
04:14:55,920 --> 04:14:56,360
Okay.

9054
04:14:56,860 --> 04:14:58,300
It's very risky.

9055
04:14:58,440 --> 04:14:58,980
There's an...

9056
04:14:59,160 --> 04:15:01,760
It's very risky but we could go through a tunnel.

9057
04:15:02,880 --> 04:15:03,240
Enemy.

9058
04:15:03,240 --> 04:15:03,240
Enemy.

9059
04:15:03,240 --> 04:15:03,240
Enemy.

9060
04:15:03,240 --> 04:15:03,240
Umm.

9061
04:15:04,260 --> 04:15:04,820
That one?

9062
04:15:05,000 --> 04:15:05,900
She's on the beach.

9063
04:15:06,100 --> 04:15:06,400
Yeah.

9064
04:15:06,480 --> 04:15:08,120
But there's a team here too.

9065
04:15:08,500 --> 04:15:08,820
Enemy.

9066
04:15:09,220 --> 04:15:09,560
Enemy.

9067
04:15:09,720 --> 04:15:09,720
Enemy.

9068
04:15:11,000 --> 04:15:11,360
Oh.

9069
04:15:11,480 --> 04:15:12,540
I see it here too.

9070
04:15:12,740 --> 04:15:13,520
This is scary.

9071
04:15:13,900 --> 04:15:14,620
Where do we go?

9072
04:15:15,420 --> 04:15:16,380
I don't have redeploy.

9073
04:15:17,460 --> 04:15:18,100
They're crossing?

9074
04:15:19,540 --> 04:15:19,900
Oh.

9075
04:15:19,980 --> 04:15:20,420
Now they know.

9076
04:15:20,600 --> 04:15:20,860
Wait.

9077
04:15:20,900 --> 04:15:21,140
I have ult.

9078
04:15:21,200 --> 04:15:21,440
I have ult.

9079
04:15:21,480 --> 04:15:21,820
I have ult.

9080
04:15:22,400 --> 04:15:22,760
Okay.

9081
04:15:23,320 --> 04:15:23,860
I'll ult here.

9082
04:15:24,660 --> 04:15:25,380
I'm gonna ult here.

9083
04:15:25,500 --> 04:15:25,660
They come up.

9084
04:15:26,520 --> 04:15:26,880
Yeah.

9085
04:15:26,940 --> 04:15:27,760
But they have to run.

9086
04:15:27,900 --> 04:15:28,680
They have to run then.

9087
04:15:29,160 --> 04:15:30,400
And then we can walk up here.

9088
04:15:30,620 --> 04:15:31,460
Yeah, we can walk up.

9089
04:15:34,040 --> 04:15:35,080
It's time to walk up.

9090
04:15:35,140 --> 04:15:35,560
Okay, nice.

9091
04:15:36,840 --> 04:15:39,420
Alright, let's see if there's anyone above us.

9092
04:15:41,700 --> 04:15:42,360
There's people here.

9093
04:15:42,600 --> 04:15:42,760
I...

9094
04:15:43,880 --> 04:15:46,020
I don't think there's anyone above us.

9095
04:15:46,140 --> 04:15:46,580
Yeah, we're fine.

9096
04:15:50,000 --> 04:15:51,660
But there's team here though.

9097
04:15:54,260 --> 04:15:55,100
Oh, I missed.

9098
04:15:55,960 --> 04:15:56,720
And I missed.

9099
04:15:56,740 --> 04:15:57,520
I missed every shot.

9100
04:15:57,640 --> 04:15:57,940
Nice.

9101
04:15:58,020 --> 04:15:58,400
Me too.

9102
04:15:59,160 --> 04:16:00,020
I'm gonna smoke them.

9103
04:16:00,100 --> 04:16:01,200
It's too embarrassing now.

9104
04:16:02,380 --> 04:16:03,500
It's too embarrassing.

9105
04:16:04,600 --> 04:16:05,700
Wait, they're resing.

9106
04:16:06,440 --> 04:16:07,160
Wait, no!

9107
04:16:07,200 --> 04:16:08,760
I gave them a smoke so they can res!

9108
04:16:11,440 --> 04:16:12,960
Oh, that's another squad?

9109
04:16:15,100 --> 04:16:15,580
No!

9110
04:16:16,800 --> 04:16:20,180
I gave them a smoke for their fucking res!

9111
04:16:24,740 --> 04:16:25,220
That's...

9112
04:16:25,220 --> 04:16:27,260
We gotta go inside the lane.

9113
04:16:27,280 --> 04:16:27,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9114
04:16:27,880 --> 04:16:29,060
Where do we wanna go?

9115
04:16:29,060 --> 04:16:29,160
I don't know.

9116
04:16:30,100 --> 04:16:31,220
We gotta figure out soon.

9117
04:16:33,660 --> 04:16:35,820
Maybe we land over there?

9118
04:16:36,080 --> 04:16:36,360
Oh, sure.

9119
04:16:37,400 --> 04:16:38,280
We have to...

9120
04:16:38,280 --> 04:16:39,200
I'm smoking.

9121
04:16:40,020 --> 04:16:40,420
Okay.

9122
04:16:40,600 --> 04:16:41,300
Oh, fuck.

9123
04:16:41,360 --> 04:16:41,580
Okay.

9124
04:16:41,640 --> 04:16:42,280
We have to go then.

9125
04:16:42,940 --> 04:16:43,620
Okay, bye.

9126
04:16:44,280 --> 04:16:44,680
Ow!

9127
04:16:45,080 --> 04:16:45,480
Ow.

9128
04:16:45,640 --> 04:16:46,040
Ouch!

9129
04:16:46,220 --> 04:16:46,620
Ouch!

9130
04:16:46,720 --> 04:16:47,000
Ouch!

9131
04:16:47,000 --> 04:16:47,660
Okay, go here.

9132
04:16:49,300 --> 04:16:49,960
Nice, nice.

9133
04:16:50,180 --> 04:16:51,500
Oh, there's a team in front.

9134
04:16:52,540 --> 04:16:53,680
Do you guys have more syringes?

9135
04:16:53,740 --> 04:16:54,100
I have two.

9136
04:16:54,620 --> 04:16:55,600
I have four.

9137
04:16:55,760 --> 04:16:56,500
I can't give you one.

9138
04:16:56,780 --> 04:16:57,180
Okay, okay.

9139
04:16:58,280 --> 04:16:59,040
Okay, okay.

9140
04:16:59,040 --> 04:17:00,620
Be careful, because they're gonna have high ground.

9141
04:17:01,100 --> 04:17:01,780
Yeah, yeah.

9142
04:17:01,940 --> 04:17:02,460
I'm watching.

9143
04:17:02,660 --> 04:17:02,840
I'm watching.

9144
04:17:03,800 --> 04:17:04,200
No!

9145
04:17:04,320 --> 04:17:06,640
They're fighting with another team.

9146
04:17:06,760 --> 04:17:07,600
Be careful!

9147
04:17:07,760 --> 04:17:07,900
Be careful!

9148
04:17:09,860 --> 04:17:10,460
Oh, I'm out.

9149
04:17:11,080 --> 04:17:11,660
Keg one.

9150
04:17:12,380 --> 04:17:12,780
Nice.

9151
04:17:14,020 --> 04:17:14,840
I'm looking above.

9152
04:17:14,980 --> 04:17:16,040
I'm gonna look above us.

9153
04:17:16,720 --> 04:17:17,120
Yeah.

9154
04:17:17,320 --> 04:17:18,580
They're fighting with another team.

9155
04:17:20,120 --> 04:17:20,920
I mean...

9156
04:17:21,380 --> 04:17:23,800
Maybe we can go to that building.

9157
04:17:24,860 --> 04:17:25,600
Okay, you guys.

9158
04:17:25,720 --> 04:17:27,280
I'm gonna look real fast.

9159
04:17:27,440 --> 04:17:28,180
If I die, I die.

9160
04:17:28,340 --> 04:17:28,500
Okay.

9161
04:17:28,500 --> 04:17:28,640
I'm gonna look real fast.

9162
04:17:29,260 --> 04:17:29,620
Okay.

9163
04:17:31,640 --> 04:17:32,360
Okay, okay.

9164
04:17:32,480 --> 04:17:33,320
If I die, I die.

9165
04:17:33,780 --> 04:17:35,120
I believe in you two.

9166
04:17:35,220 --> 04:17:36,320
And I can watch you two play.

9167
04:17:38,340 --> 04:17:39,400
You can come here.

9168
04:17:39,860 --> 04:17:40,220
Goodbye!

9169
04:17:42,980 --> 04:17:43,520
I'm gonna break.

9170
04:17:44,560 --> 04:17:45,120
It's fine.

9171
04:17:46,720 --> 04:17:47,320
It's fine.

9172
04:17:47,380 --> 04:17:47,740
I'm good.

9173
04:17:47,800 --> 04:17:48,240
I'm good.

9174
04:17:48,240 --> 04:17:48,600
I'm good.

9175
04:17:48,680 --> 04:17:48,940
I'm good.

9176
04:17:48,940 --> 04:17:49,120
I'm good.

9177
04:17:49,160 --> 04:17:49,440
Go, go, go.

9178
04:17:49,440 --> 04:17:49,760
Go, go, go.

9179
04:17:50,120 --> 04:17:50,480
Okay.

9180
04:17:52,960 --> 04:17:53,680
This building.

9181
04:17:53,860 --> 04:17:54,160
This building.

9182
04:17:54,720 --> 04:17:55,460
Okay, okay, okay.

9183
04:17:55,480 --> 04:17:55,920
Go, go, go.

9184
04:17:55,920 --> 04:17:56,060
There's no one.

9185
04:17:56,100 --> 04:17:56,620
There's no one.

9186
04:17:56,640 --> 04:17:57,020
It's free.

9187
04:17:57,140 --> 04:17:57,340
Free.

9188
04:17:57,620 --> 04:17:58,920
Oh, oh, oh.

9189
04:17:59,220 --> 04:17:59,700
I'm gonna move.

9190
04:17:59,760 --> 04:18:00,200
I'm gonna move.

9191
04:18:00,200 --> 04:18:00,240
I'm gonna move.

9192
04:18:01,620 --> 04:18:02,100
Wow!

9193
04:18:02,360 --> 04:18:02,840
Wow!

9194
04:18:03,120 --> 04:18:04,000
They're fighting, too!

9195
04:18:04,500 --> 04:18:04,980
Crazy!

9196
04:18:05,500 --> 04:18:06,340
They're fucking...

9197
04:18:06,340 --> 04:18:07,640
Wait, there's people behind us.

9198
04:18:08,580 --> 04:18:09,060
Crazy.

9199
04:18:09,280 --> 04:18:10,320
They're fucking crazy.

9200
04:18:12,640 --> 04:18:13,740
House fighter, house fighter.

9201
04:18:13,960 --> 04:18:14,440
Where?

9202
04:18:14,600 --> 04:18:15,080
Ping.

9203
04:18:15,160 --> 04:18:15,300
Ping.

9204
04:18:15,440 --> 04:18:16,520
Over there, over there, over there, over there.

9205
04:18:17,800 --> 04:18:18,680
They're going third.

9206
04:18:18,800 --> 04:18:19,260
They're going third.

9207
04:18:21,060 --> 04:18:21,980
Everyone left.

9208
04:18:22,100 --> 04:18:23,000
Everyone left the...

9209
04:18:23,000 --> 04:18:23,280
Yeah.

9210
04:18:23,360 --> 04:18:24,080
Everyone left us.

9211
04:18:25,420 --> 04:18:28,660
Everyone just wants to fucking fight this.

9212
04:18:28,660 --> 04:18:29,040
Everyone has energy.

9213
04:18:29,280 --> 04:18:30,180
Everyone wants to...

9214
04:18:30,200 --> 04:18:31,540
I will go to this house.

9215
04:18:31,820 --> 04:18:32,860
Yeah, we'll just cross.

9216
04:18:35,460 --> 04:18:36,620
I'm looking here.

9217
04:18:37,320 --> 04:18:37,800
Okay.

9218
04:18:39,140 --> 04:18:40,040
They're pushing?

9219
04:18:42,300 --> 04:18:43,440
Are they pushing?

9220
04:18:43,960 --> 04:18:44,400
On me!

9221
04:18:44,520 --> 04:18:44,660
On me!

9222
04:18:45,140 --> 04:18:45,620
Here!

9223
04:18:48,200 --> 04:18:48,980
Behind this.

9224
04:18:51,740 --> 04:18:52,700
On me!

9225
04:18:52,760 --> 04:18:52,860
On me!

9226
04:18:53,080 --> 04:18:53,500
They're pushing.

9227
04:18:53,680 --> 04:18:54,100
They're planning on pushing.

9228
04:18:55,140 --> 04:18:56,100
How many people?

9229
04:18:56,380 --> 04:18:57,100
Two teams.

9230
04:18:57,140 --> 04:18:58,980
One behind this box and one here.

9231
04:18:58,980 --> 04:18:59,120
Okay.

9232
04:18:59,340 --> 04:19:00,980
I'll give you a...

9233
04:19:01,400 --> 04:19:02,040
Pack one.

9234
04:19:02,320 --> 04:19:03,380
Careful of this box.

9235
04:19:03,480 --> 04:19:04,380
This box has a team too.

9236
04:19:09,860 --> 04:19:10,980
There's a guy right here.

9237
04:19:11,520 --> 04:19:12,640
Yeah, this guy can come.

9238
04:19:17,400 --> 04:19:17,760
Jesus.

9239
04:19:18,940 --> 04:19:19,300
What?

9240
04:19:20,060 --> 04:19:20,420
No!

9241
04:19:20,540 --> 04:19:21,120
Okay, they might push.

9242
04:19:21,220 --> 04:19:21,580
They might push.

9243
04:19:21,860 --> 04:19:22,800
Can you guys get a rez?

9244
04:19:23,160 --> 04:19:23,840
No, no, they're pushing.

9245
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:24,820
No, no, no.

9246
04:19:25,100 --> 04:19:25,620
They're pushing.

9247
04:19:25,700 --> 04:19:25,900
They're pushing.

9248
04:19:26,680 --> 04:19:27,040
Careful.

9249
04:19:29,420 --> 04:19:29,780
Okay.

9250
04:19:31,020 --> 04:19:31,240
Careful.

9251
04:19:31,260 --> 04:19:31,860
They're full pushing.

9252
04:19:33,320 --> 04:19:34,040
Crack.

9253
04:19:34,080 --> 04:19:34,980
Oh, goodbye.

9254
04:19:35,160 --> 04:19:36,560
Goodbye, Ditto.

9255
04:19:37,240 --> 04:19:39,400
I got... What the fuck?

9256
04:19:40,820 --> 04:19:46,080
One, two, three, four, five headshots in a row.

9257
04:19:46,440 --> 04:19:46,600
One, two, three, four, five headshots in a row.

9258
04:19:46,600 --> 04:19:46,600
Really?

9259
04:19:46,960 --> 04:19:47,380
Yeah!

9260
04:19:47,520 --> 04:19:48,960
From three different...

9261
04:19:48,960 --> 04:19:50,500
From two different people.

9262
04:19:51,480 --> 04:19:54,300
I was like, how did I die so fast?

9263
04:19:56,780 --> 04:19:58,560
Oh my god.

9264
04:19:59,080 --> 04:20:00,100
That's dumb.

9265
04:20:01,020 --> 04:20:03,000
Five different headshots.

9266
04:20:03,240 --> 04:20:03,680
That's...

9267
04:20:03,680 --> 04:20:04,860
Wow.

9268
04:20:05,560 --> 04:20:06,720
NG, NG.

9269
04:20:07,480 --> 04:20:09,060
Five headshots.

9270
04:20:09,680 --> 04:20:10,860
That's a lot.

9271
04:20:10,940 --> 04:20:11,120
Wow.

9272
04:20:11,120 --> 04:20:15,740
That is way too many headshots.

9273
04:20:17,800 --> 04:20:19,220
Oh my god.

9274
04:20:20,280 --> 04:20:20,860
Oh.

9275
04:20:23,160 --> 04:20:24,460
That's too much fun.

9276
04:20:28,100 --> 04:20:29,410
Oh my god, please.

9277
04:20:30,230 --> 04:20:31,810
Just... You know what?

9278
04:20:32,390 --> 04:20:32,970
Send it.

9279
04:20:33,210 --> 04:20:33,670
Send it.

9280
04:20:33,850 --> 04:20:36,350
It's... Maybe I just need to be revved.

9281
04:20:37,510 --> 04:20:39,190
We won on rev.

9282
04:20:39,710 --> 04:20:41,450
We won on rev.

9283
04:20:41,730 --> 04:20:41,730
We won on rev.

9284
04:20:41,730 --> 04:20:41,950
Okay, okay.

9285
04:20:41,950 --> 04:20:43,870
Maybe I just need to be revved.

9286
04:20:43,910 --> 04:20:43,930
Yeah, right.

9287
04:20:44,050 --> 04:20:44,470
Yeah, right.

9288
04:20:50,380 --> 04:20:51,560
This is it.

9289
04:21:03,520 --> 04:21:04,380
Here we go.

9290
04:21:06,240 --> 04:21:07,160
We got this.

9291
04:21:07,360 --> 04:21:08,140
I can... I believe.

9292
04:21:10,700 --> 04:21:11,640
I believe.

9293
04:21:14,960 --> 04:21:15,540
We believe.

9294
04:21:15,540 --> 04:21:15,760
We believe.

9295
04:21:16,380 --> 04:21:16,960
Yeah.

9296
04:21:25,870 --> 04:21:26,450
Wow.

9297
04:21:38,790 --> 04:21:39,750
We can win.

9298
04:21:40,130 --> 04:21:41,150
I believe in us.

9299
04:21:41,290 --> 04:21:41,550
Sure.

9300
04:21:41,870 --> 04:21:42,450
Sure.

9301
04:21:43,710 --> 04:21:44,710
We can win.

9302
04:21:45,070 --> 04:21:45,890
You have to IGL us.

9303
04:21:46,090 --> 04:21:47,730
If you IGL us, you will win.

9304
04:21:50,430 --> 04:21:51,730
Okay, okay, okay.

9305
04:21:53,330 --> 04:21:54,250
We're just...

9306
04:21:55,330 --> 04:21:57,130
We're just missing your IGL.

9307
04:21:58,290 --> 04:21:58,890
Yeah.

9308
04:21:59,850 --> 04:22:01,410
Please IGL us.

9309
04:22:01,430 --> 04:22:01,750
It's all.

9310
04:22:02,910 --> 04:22:03,910
One team, one team.

9311
04:22:05,290 --> 04:22:06,090
They have like...

9312
04:22:06,090 --> 04:22:06,850
They have like...

9313
04:22:08,870 --> 04:22:09,510
I don't know.

9314
04:22:10,470 --> 04:22:12,110
Passwader with default skin.

9315
04:22:13,710 --> 04:22:14,430
It's okay.

9316
04:22:14,510 --> 04:22:15,150
We can do this.

9317
04:22:15,150 --> 04:22:15,630
I believe.

9318
04:22:17,510 --> 04:22:18,630
I'm not scared.

9319
04:22:19,070 --> 04:22:20,170
Oh shit, I have a charm.

9320
04:22:21,290 --> 04:22:22,490
What happened?

9321
04:22:22,790 --> 04:22:23,890
Oh, what happened?

9322
04:22:23,890 --> 04:22:25,170
I'm gonna die.

9323
04:22:25,810 --> 04:22:26,290
Whoa.

9324
04:22:26,490 --> 04:22:27,010
No, you're not.

9325
04:22:27,090 --> 04:22:27,430
You're fine.

9326
04:22:27,530 --> 04:22:27,890
I'm watching.

9327
04:22:28,790 --> 04:22:29,690
They're running.

9328
04:22:29,810 --> 04:22:30,170
They're running.

9329
04:22:31,110 --> 04:22:32,030
Okay, nice.

9330
04:22:32,250 --> 04:22:32,990
They're scared.

9331
04:22:33,970 --> 04:22:35,910
They saw you and they got scared.

9332
04:22:36,310 --> 04:22:36,790
Yeah.

9333
04:22:38,190 --> 04:22:39,810
When you're running away too.

9334
04:22:42,790 --> 04:22:43,870
You're so scary.

9335
04:22:44,210 --> 04:22:44,230
Oh, sorry.

9336
04:22:46,030 --> 04:22:46,810
What happened?

9337
04:22:47,010 --> 04:22:47,830
I thought you're better.

9338
04:22:49,090 --> 04:22:50,030
I'll help it up.

9339
04:22:50,030 --> 04:22:50,750
It's just me.

9340
04:22:51,810 --> 04:22:53,190
I have a charm.

9341
04:22:53,670 --> 04:22:54,650
I'm coming over.

9342
04:22:55,330 --> 04:22:57,450
Wait, what?

9343
04:22:57,610 --> 04:22:58,730
That charge rifle too.

9344
04:22:59,890 --> 04:23:00,410
Really?

9345
04:23:01,170 --> 04:23:02,830
I'm gonna push.

9346
04:23:03,850 --> 04:23:04,210
Whoa.

9347
04:23:05,270 --> 04:23:06,430
How dare you.

9348
04:23:07,290 --> 04:23:07,930
Here.

9349
04:23:10,610 --> 04:23:11,470
Over there.

9350
04:23:12,290 --> 04:23:14,350
So far, I think they help scope.

9351
04:23:14,730 --> 04:23:16,430
They have two snipers.

9352
04:23:16,430 --> 04:23:16,730
They have scope.

9353
04:23:17,190 --> 04:23:17,930
Yeah, they do.

9354
04:23:18,170 --> 04:23:19,090
They must have.

9355
04:23:21,990 --> 04:23:22,490
Okay.

9356
04:23:23,990 --> 04:23:24,490
Cool.

9357
04:23:25,690 --> 04:23:26,370
Oh, wait.

9358
04:23:26,410 --> 04:23:26,870
That's a window.

9359
04:23:27,770 --> 04:23:28,390
Nice shot.

9360
04:23:29,590 --> 04:23:30,590
Thank you.

9361
04:23:31,210 --> 04:23:31,710
Whoa.

9362
04:23:31,790 --> 04:23:32,750
They didn't scan me.

9363
04:23:33,150 --> 04:23:35,210
I'm ready to go whenever... Do we have gun?

9364
04:23:36,070 --> 04:23:36,570
Yeah.

9365
04:23:36,610 --> 04:23:37,510
I have a gun.

9366
04:23:40,890 --> 04:23:42,250
Waiting for the scan.

9367
04:23:43,250 --> 04:23:44,230
Waiting for the scan.

9368
04:23:44,930 --> 04:23:45,870
Oh, inside.

9369
04:23:47,470 --> 04:23:48,130

9370
04:23:48,290 --> 04:23:48,530
Yeah.

9371
04:23:50,030 --> 04:23:50,190
Okay.

9372
04:23:51,650 --> 04:23:52,030
Whoa.

9373
04:23:53,070 --> 04:23:53,830

04:23:57,390 --> 04:23:58,110
Oh my god.

9380
04:23:58,230 --> 04:23:58,530
Sorry.

9381
04:23:58,910 --> 04:23:59,490

9382
04:24:01,050 --> 04:24:01,430
Crack.

9383
04:24:03,110 --> 04:24:03,550
Crack him.

9384
04:24:04,250 --> 04:24:04,630
Nice.

9385
04:24:05,210 --> 04:24:05,890
I have to heal.

9386
04:24:06,410 --> 04:24:07,170
Thank you.

9387
04:24:14,240 --> 04:24:14,740
Oh, nice.

9388
04:24:14,780 --> 04:24:15,080
Last guy.

9389
04:24:15,100 --> 04:24:15,380
Last guy.

9390
04:24:15,420 --> 04:24:15,680
Nice.

9391
04:24:16,020 --> 04:24:16,820
Nice one.

9392
04:24:17,080 --> 04:24:17,460
Easy.

9393
04:24:20,480 --> 04:24:23,740
Did you just watch him run past you?

9394
04:24:24,040 --> 04:24:24,540
Did you just watch him run past you?

9395
04:24:24,560 --> 04:24:24,900
Yes.

9396
04:24:25,620 --> 04:24:25,980
Yes.

9397
04:24:26,140 --> 04:24:26,360
Yes.

9398
04:24:28,680 --> 04:24:32,300
I didn't see him until you told me.

9399
04:24:33,620 --> 04:24:35,380
I was like, what the fuck?

9400
04:24:35,540 --> 04:24:36,620
He's in front of you.

9401
04:24:39,160 --> 04:24:40,620
I didn't see him.

9402
04:24:45,080 --> 04:24:47,080
I wonder what's in the center now.

9403
04:24:47,660 --> 04:24:49,000
Now that there's no armor.

9404
04:24:49,540 --> 04:24:50,640
We have a...

9405
04:24:52,080 --> 04:24:53,420
I need a hemlock.

9406
04:24:53,420 --> 04:24:54,540
Hemlock?

9407
04:24:55,250 --> 04:24:55,660
Okay.

9408
04:24:55,840 --> 04:24:56,820

A P20?

9414
04:25:02,240 --> 04:25:02,840
No.

9415
04:25:03,320 --> 04:25:04,140
Okay.

9416
04:25:07,270 --> 04:25:07,680
No.

9417
04:25:07,680 --> 04:25:09,220
Absolutely not.

9418
04:25:09,620 --> 04:25:10,440
Okay.

9419
04:25:12,240 --> 04:25:13,660
Not that.

9420

Where are you?

9423
04:25:18,520 --> 04:25:20,260
I need that.

9424
04:25:23,780 --> 04:25:24,260
Okay.

9425
04:25:24,420 --> 04:25:25,880
I have... I have 4 battery.

9426
04:25:26,220 --> 04:25:27,900
If you want one, tell me.

9427

9428
04:25:28,260 --> 04:25:28,900

04:25:30,960 --> 04:25:31,620
I need a bat.

9431
04:25:32,500 --> 04:25:32,980
Yeah.

9432
04:25:33,100 --> 04:25:34,400
And here, one more.

9433
04:25:35,700 --> 04:25:37,320
If I have 30, 30, let me know.

9434
04:25:37,720 --> 04:25:38,200
Okay.

9435
04:25:38,860 --> 04:25:39,260
Okay.

9436

I'm like...

9437
04:25:44,180 --> 04:25:45,440
So poor.

9438
04:25:46,320 --> 04:25:47,680
Actually, no.

9439
04:25:47,820 --> 04:25:48,920
I have good guns, but...

9440
04:25:48,920 --> 04:25:50,680
I don't want to use these guns.

9441
04:25:51,380 --> 04:25:51,860
Okay.

9442
04:25:52,240 --> 04:25:53,180
Every time...

9443
04:25:53,180 --> 04:25:55,420
Every time I'm gonna give you a shield...

9444
04:25:56,640 --> 04:25:58,380
I always miss...

9445
04:25:58,380 --> 04:26:00,580
I always give it to Uto.

9446
04:26:00,860 --> 04:26:02,360
I always give it to Uto.

9447
04:26:02,360 --> 04:26:02,660
Wingman!

9448
04:26:02,980 --> 04:26:03,540
Wait, wait, wait.

9449
04:26:05,620 --> 04:26:06,520
Let's get Wingman.

9450
04:26:06,700 --> 04:26:07,380
Let's get Wingman.

9451
04:26:08,920 --> 04:26:09,200
Okay.

9452
04:26:09,200 --> 04:26:09,760
Landslide...

9453
04:26:09,760 --> 04:26:10,560
Be careful.

9454
04:26:10,660 --> 04:26:11,540
Landslide is looted.

9455
04:26:12,840 --> 04:26:13,780
I'm not scared.

9456
04:26:13,900 --> 04:26:14,300
I'm rev.

9457
04:26:14,880 --> 04:26:15,440
Alright.

9458
04:26:15,500 --> 04:26:16,500
Do you want the Wingman?

9459
04:26:16,600 --> 04:26:16,880
Uto?

9460
04:26:17,020 --> 04:26:17,320
Tuto?

9461
04:26:17,600 --> 04:26:18,100
No.

9462
04:26:18,100 --> 04:26:18,660
No.

9463
04:26:19,120 --> 04:26:19,960
What happened?

9464
04:26:19,980 --> 04:26:21,580
You used to be so good at Wingman.

9465
04:26:22,000 --> 04:26:22,560
Wow.

9466
04:26:22,800 --> 04:26:23,620
What happened?

9467
04:26:24,180 --> 04:26:25,600
Okay, okay, okay.

9468
04:26:26,020 --> 04:26:26,620
What happened?

9469
04:26:26,940 --> 04:26:27,300
Okay.

9470
04:26:27,500 --> 04:26:29,280
Why don't you... Why don't you use it?

9471
04:26:29,560 --> 04:26:30,000
Okay, fine.

9472
04:26:30,080 --> 04:26:30,560
Okay, okay.

9473
04:26:30,700 --> 04:26:31,480
I'll use it.

9474
04:26:32,140 --> 04:26:33,960
I'll show you how it's done.

9475
04:26:34,740 --> 04:26:35,300
Okay.

9476
04:26:35,520 --> 04:26:37,060
Okay, I still need...

9477
04:26:37,800 --> 04:26:39,760
I have hemlock and bolt.

9478
04:26:41,960 --> 04:26:43,680
I have my favorite gun.

9479
04:26:43,940 --> 04:26:44,960
I need...

9480
04:26:45,600 --> 04:26:47,020

04:26:50,620 --> 04:26:54,380
Oh, if you have RE...

04:26:54,380 --> 04:26:55,100
Here, here, RE!

9485
04:26:55,740 --> 04:26:56,300
Nice.

9486

Nice.

9487
04:26:59,820 --> 04:27:00,140
Maybe...

9488
04:27:01,120 --> 04:27:04,000
Here, I dropped...

9489
04:27:04,000 --> 04:27:04,720
Nice, nice.

9490
04:27:04,960 --> 04:27:06,340
I dropped so many things.

9491
04:27:07,160 --> 04:27:07,800
Okay, nice.

9492
04:27:08,140 --> 04:27:09,420
This mine now.

9493
04:27:09,680 --> 04:27:10,780
Wait, I'm gonna...

9494
04:27:10,780 --> 04:27:13,580
I think I dropped a light mag.

9495
04:27:14,500 --> 04:27:15,420
I have a key.

9496
04:27:16,680 --> 04:27:17,640
Oh, are we gonna go to the...

9497
04:27:18,100 --> 04:27:18,480
Okay, yeah, yeah.

9498
04:27:18,480 --> 04:27:19,020
Let's go to the vault.

9499
04:27:19,380 --> 04:27:20,540
Let's just gear up.

9500
04:27:21,960 --> 04:27:23,820
Did I... Do I have a light mag?

9501
04:27:23,920 --> 04:27:24,300
Yeah, I did.

9502
04:27:24,700 --> 04:27:25,400
I'm coming over.

9503
04:27:30,650 --> 04:27:31,130
Alright.

9504
04:27:31,370 --> 04:27:32,510
I'm coming over.

9505
04:27:37,060 --> 04:27:38,840
Wait, the wingman doesn't have a digi anymore?

9506
04:27:39,420 --> 04:27:40,580
The fuck is this?

9507
04:27:41,200 --> 04:27:41,680
Really?

9508
04:27:42,340 --> 04:27:42,820
Wait.

9509
04:27:43,500 --> 04:27:43,980
Really?

9510
04:27:44,240 --> 04:27:46,640
Oh, there's people!

9511
04:27:47,380 --> 04:27:47,860
No!

9512
04:27:48,680 --> 04:27:49,160
Please!

9513
04:27:50,220 --> 04:27:51,320
Oh my god!

Nice!

9517

Let's get the tiger's flag!

9518
04:28:00,040 --> 04:28:02,320
Okay, okay, okay, I'm leaving!

9519
04:28:03,120 --> 04:28:05,020
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

9520
04:28:05,980 --> 04:28:07,240
I'm gonna use my urn.

9521
04:28:08,000 --> 04:28:10,020
Yeah, yeah, run, run, run.

9522
04:28:10,420 --> 04:28:10,660
Nice, nice, nice.

9523
04:28:10,800 --> 04:28:12,740
Please, I just got my wingman!

9524
04:28:13,040 --> 04:28:15,220
Let me at least use it one time!

9525
04:28:15,360 --> 04:28:16,120
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push!

9526
04:28:18,140 --> 04:28:19,460
What the fuck?!

9527
04:28:19,460 --> 04:28:19,640
What the fuck?!

9528
04:28:22,840 --> 04:28:23,860
I'm so sad.

9529
04:28:28,960 --> 04:28:30,900
I'm actually so sad.

9530
04:28:32,820 --> 04:28:35,640
I can't use my wingman!

9531
04:28:36,400 --> 04:28:36,980
I can't use my wingman!

9532
04:28:36,980 --> 04:28:38,040
Where did the iron hit me?

9533
04:28:38,160 --> 04:28:41,800
He didn't loot my body!

9534
04:28:42,020 --> 04:28:44,340
My wingman is still there!

9535
04:28:44,680 --> 04:28:46,620
My wingman is still there!

9536
04:28:50,570 --> 04:28:52,270

04:28:52,990 --> 04:28:58,190
I have the god loadout!

9539
04:28:58,450 --> 04:29:00,310
Are you fucking kidding me?

9540
04:29:01,530 --> 04:29:02,970
Dude, are you happy?

9541
04:29:03,750 --> 04:29:04,030
No!

9542
04:29:10,270 --> 04:29:15,850
What was this guy?

9543
04:29:15,950 --> 04:29:17,030
How can you call me?

9544
04:29:17,090 --> 04:29:17,530
No!

9545
04:29:17,670 --> 04:29:19,390
Dude, what the...

I lost my...

9547
04:29:23,390 --> 04:29:24,170
No!

9548
04:29:27,510 --> 04:29:29,530
I can't believe it!

9549
04:29:30,430 --> 04:29:32,810
I can't believe it!

9550
04:29:32,810 --> 04:29:33,130
I can't believe it!

9551
04:29:33,130 --> 04:29:34,530
I couldn't...

9552
04:29:34,890 --> 04:29:37,370
I couldn't even use it!

9553
04:29:37,730 --> 04:29:39,310
That's the worst part!

9554
04:29:40,710 --> 04:29:44,250
I don't even get to use it!

9555
04:29:44,650 --> 04:29:47,550
You have hammerpoint and you have wingman.

9556
04:29:47,950 --> 04:29:50,810
You have really, really good loot.

9557
04:29:52,790 --> 04:29:53,090
You have really, really good loot.

9558
04:29:53,090 --> 04:29:53,350
But...

9559
04:29:53,350 --> 04:29:55,470
Nice, Tana.

9560
04:29:55,730 --> 04:29:58,370
You have no chance to use this, unfortunately.

9561
04:29:59,070 --> 04:30:00,750
Oh my god.

9562
04:30:06,670 --> 04:30:08,670
Oh, such a bad timing.

9563
04:30:09,150 --> 04:30:09,210
Oh, such a bad timing.

9564
04:30:09,470 --> 04:30:11,070
Jun-sensei.

9565
04:30:13,330 --> 04:30:14,970
Oh my god.

9566
04:30:15,430 --> 04:30:15,950
Oh my god.

9567
04:30:16,130 --> 04:30:17,170
Oh my god.

9568
04:30:20,010 --> 04:30:22,230
I can't believe it.

9569
04:30:22,330 --> 04:30:23,270
I can't...

9570
04:30:23,270 --> 04:30:25,050
I can't believe it.

9571
04:30:25,050 --> 04:30:26,050
Holy shit.

9572
04:30:26,150 --> 04:30:27,970
That was so unlucky.

9573
04:30:30,250 --> 04:30:33,030
Bro, fuck that team for six.

9574
04:30:33,050 --> 04:30:33,110
Bro, fuck that team for six.

9575
04:30:33,130 --> 04:30:35,050
Why are you aiming in there?

9576
04:30:37,210 --> 04:30:37,870
Oh...

9577
04:30:44,240 --> 04:30:44,900
Oh...

9578
04:30:44,900 --> 04:30:46,520
Oh my god.

9579
04:30:49,060 --> 04:30:50,920
I can't believe it.

9580
04:30:58,010 --> 04:30:59,160
That was actually crazy.

9581
04:31:01,860 --> 04:31:02,520
Crazy.

9582
04:31:12,830 --> 04:31:14,010
Go, go, go.

9583
04:31:14,270 --> 04:31:15,510
Go, go, go, go.

9584
04:31:15,610 --> 04:31:16,250
Go, go, go.

9585
04:31:18,490 --> 04:31:20,170
Oh my god.

9586
04:31:21,250 --> 04:31:21,770
F***.

9587
04:31:32,080 --> 04:31:33,020
No way.

9588
04:31:33,260 --> 04:31:34,260
There is no way.

9589
04:31:34,400 --> 04:31:35,440
We can't get champion.

9590
04:31:35,980 --> 04:31:40,100
We can, we can't.

9591
04:31:40,100 --> 04:31:40,540
Can.

9592
04:31:40,940 --> 04:31:42,660
We just got fucked over.

9593
04:31:43,040 --> 04:31:44,240
Don't stop believing.

9594
04:31:45,740 --> 04:31:46,540
One team, one team.

9595
04:31:46,820 --> 04:31:47,200
We will.

9596
04:31:47,260 --> 04:31:49,480
Okay, okay, okay.

9597
04:31:49,660 --> 04:31:51,640
Okay, i'm ready.

9598
04:31:51,760 --> 04:31:52,480
I'm gonna land here.

9599
04:31:52,900 --> 04:31:54,120
2 teams, 2 teams.

9600
04:31:54,180 --> 04:31:54,860
Cool team!

9601
04:31:55,140 --> 04:31:55,560
2 teams?

9602
04:31:58,280 --> 04:31:59,200
What happened?

9603
04:31:59,960 --> 04:32:01,460
Goodbye everybody.

9604
04:32:01,820 --> 04:32:05,900
What happened?

9605
04:32:06,180 --> 04:32:08,540
Look at what's going on right now!

9606
04:32:08,880 --> 04:32:09,300
Woohoo!

9607
04:32:09,840 --> 04:32:10,800
I'm okay.

9608
04:32:11,200 --> 04:32:12,220
I'm okay.

9609
04:32:13,980 --> 04:32:14,900
It's fine.

9610
04:32:15,980 --> 04:32:17,840
I have to keep on believing.

9611
04:32:21,840 --> 04:32:23,440
Don't stop believing.

9612
04:32:31,680 --> 04:32:32,520
I'm okay.

9613
04:32:32,520 --> 04:32:33,000
You're broken?

9614
04:32:33,320 --> 04:32:33,940
I'm broken.

9615
04:32:34,320 --> 04:32:34,880
Are you broken?

9616
04:32:35,120 --> 04:32:35,820
Okay.

9617
04:32:36,300 --> 04:32:41,560
That team that fucking crouched next to that cave?

9618
04:32:42,400 --> 04:32:45,000
That is so bullshit.

9619
04:32:45,360 --> 04:32:47,100
Oh, stop shooting me!

9620
04:32:47,740 --> 04:32:52,380
On the other side.

9621
04:32:52,780 --> 04:32:54,120
I'm okay.

9622
04:32:54,860 --> 04:32:56,260
I don't see anyone.

9623
04:32:56,260 --> 04:32:56,960
I don't see anyone.

9624
04:32:57,300 --> 04:32:58,220
They're triple taking.

9625
04:33:01,220 --> 04:33:02,420
Where's the second team?

9626
04:33:02,720 --> 04:33:03,960
Where the fuck are you?

9627
04:33:10,950 --> 04:33:12,150
Don't stop believing.

9628
04:33:12,150 --> 04:33:12,650
Over there.

9629
04:33:13,930 --> 04:33:15,210
One guy there.

9630
04:33:15,530 --> 04:33:16,090
Where's there?

9631
04:33:17,270 --> 04:33:17,990
Here, here.

9632
04:33:18,030 --> 04:33:18,450
On the pink.

9633
04:33:18,490 --> 04:33:18,710
Oh, okay.

9634
04:33:19,570 --> 04:33:20,470
Anybody close?

9635
04:33:20,550 --> 04:33:21,050
They come up.

9636
04:33:21,650 --> 04:33:23,050
Wait, I thought there were two.

9637
04:33:23,510 --> 04:33:25,170
I don't know another team.

9638
04:33:25,830 --> 04:33:27,730
Maybe they went to Apex Center.

9639
04:33:28,050 --> 04:33:28,630
Maybe, yeah.

9640
04:33:29,450 --> 04:33:30,310
Okay, okay.

9641
04:33:30,350 --> 04:33:30,930
Do you have a loot?

9642
04:33:32,190 --> 04:33:32,630
No.

9643
04:33:32,710 --> 04:33:33,190
Oh, wait, I do.

9644
04:33:33,290 --> 04:33:33,750
I have gun.

9645
04:33:34,530 --> 04:33:35,590
Okay, do you want to fight?

9646
04:33:37,110 --> 04:33:38,030
Wait, is that a window?

9647
04:33:38,210 --> 04:33:38,770
I can't tell.

9648
04:33:39,070 --> 04:33:40,170
Yeah, that's a window.

9649
04:33:40,210 --> 04:33:41,050
That's a window.

9650
04:33:42,170 --> 04:33:43,310
I can't tell!

9651
04:33:43,630 --> 04:33:44,790
It's so far!

9652
04:33:45,510 --> 04:33:47,050
I don't have a scope!

9653
04:33:48,910 --> 04:33:50,250
Okay, I can go up.

9654
04:33:51,250 --> 04:33:51,910
Let's do it.

9655
04:33:51,930 --> 04:33:52,330
Are we gonna go?

9656
04:33:52,830 --> 04:33:53,270
Yes.

9657
04:33:54,330 --> 04:33:54,770
Okay.

9658
04:33:54,770 --> 04:33:57,550
You say if we kill them, we win, right?

9659
04:33:58,170 --> 04:33:58,610
I'm gonna go up.

9660
04:33:58,610 --> 04:33:59,510
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

9661
04:33:59,670 --> 04:34:01,590
Two here, two here, two here, two here.

9662
04:34:01,850 --> 04:34:02,890
I think I'm gonna die.

9663
04:34:03,490 --> 04:34:04,410
Where you doing?

9664
04:34:04,490 --> 04:34:05,290
Because they are gonna B me.

9665
04:34:05,550 --> 04:34:06,950
Why are you by yourself?

9666
04:34:08,310 --> 04:34:09,050
Okay, no!

9667
04:34:09,170 --> 04:34:10,490
I'm gonna die first, I guess!

9668
04:34:14,110 --> 04:34:14,710
I'm gonna die!

9669
04:34:23,090 --> 04:34:26,110
So, I think.

9670
04:34:26,670 --> 04:34:27,930
I think maybe we run.

9671
04:34:28,550 --> 04:34:29,350
I think...

9672
04:34:30,150 --> 04:34:31,950
There's another team behind us!

9673
04:34:33,130 --> 04:34:33,530
Ah!

9674
04:34:36,330 --> 04:34:37,730
Uto, hide!

9675
04:34:38,030 --> 04:34:39,250
Uto, hide!

9676
04:34:45,630 --> 04:34:48,170
Just hide, they're right here.

9677
04:34:48,430 --> 04:34:50,350
Don't let them get to you.

9678
04:34:52,390 --> 04:34:54,550
Oh, now they show up.

9679
04:34:54,610 --> 04:34:55,090
No!

9680
04:35:02,210 --> 04:35:04,690
What the f***?

9681
04:35:04,690 --> 04:35:09,790
I can't believe they just showed up behind us.

9682
04:35:12,350 --> 04:35:15,370
Where did they come from?

9683
04:35:15,490 --> 04:35:17,070
From behind.

9684
04:35:17,710 --> 04:35:18,490
Behind us?

9685
04:35:18,770 --> 04:35:20,950
Oh, there was another team.

9686
04:35:21,030 --> 04:35:21,550
I see.

9687
04:35:22,310 --> 04:35:29,690
The first team that... okay, Dylan, we start and Dylan.

9688
04:35:30,070 --> 04:35:30,970
Oh my god.

9689
04:35:31,710 --> 04:35:34,270
How unlucky are we?

9690
04:35:36,390 --> 04:35:37,850
You are lucky.

9691
04:35:38,130 --> 04:35:38,910
You are lucky.

9692
04:35:38,910 --> 04:35:39,930
You are so lucky.

9693
04:35:44,330 --> 04:35:45,670
Oh my god.

9694
04:35:45,690 --> 04:35:46,030
Unfortunate.

9695
04:35:47,050 --> 04:35:48,170
So unfortunate.

9696
04:35:49,490 --> 04:35:53,750
Okay, this time, this game, this is it.

9697
04:35:54,870 --> 04:35:55,910
I believe.

9698
04:35:56,030 --> 04:35:57,050
There's no way.

9699
04:35:57,210 --> 04:35:58,190
There's no way.

9700
04:35:58,210 --> 04:35:59,770
Three times in a row unlucky?

9701
04:36:00,010 --> 04:36:00,930
There's no way.

9702
04:36:01,790 --> 04:36:03,330
Yes, there's no way.

9703
04:36:03,330 --> 04:36:04,050
There's no way.

9704
04:36:05,010 --> 04:36:06,230
Three times.

9705
04:36:12,350 --> 04:36:13,550
I've hit GB.

9706
04:36:14,510 --> 04:36:15,090
Oh.

9707
04:36:16,520 --> 04:36:18,510
Yeah, we have... we have...

9708
04:36:18,510 --> 04:36:19,630
Dome fight.

9709
04:36:19,870 --> 04:36:21,830
Oh, smart, smart.

9710
04:36:23,750 --> 04:36:24,910
This is it.

9711
04:36:25,530 --> 04:36:27,150
There's no way.

9712
04:36:27,570 --> 04:36:29,450
Three times in a row, no.

9713
04:36:30,430 --> 04:36:31,950
We're stronger now.

9714
04:36:34,030 --> 04:36:34,870
We're stronger now.

9715
04:36:37,890 --> 04:36:39,210
Yes, go, let's go.

9716
04:36:43,680 --> 04:36:44,160
There's...

9717
04:36:45,840 --> 04:36:47,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

9718
04:36:47,540 --> 04:36:48,280
This is it.

9719
04:36:49,040 --> 04:36:49,880
This is it.

9720
04:36:50,320 --> 04:36:51,040
Go, go, go.

9721
04:36:51,160 --> 04:36:51,500
Okay.

9722
04:36:51,500 --> 04:36:53,820
Okay, we were always lucky on countdown.

9723
04:36:54,780 --> 04:36:55,260
Yey.

9724
04:36:55,260 --> 04:36:55,520
Yes.

9725
04:36:55,560 --> 04:36:55,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9726
04:36:56,320 --> 04:36:57,860
Countdown, we've always been lucky.

9727
04:36:58,360 --> 04:37:01,140
We always win the fights on countdown.

9728
04:37:01,180 --> 04:37:01,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9729
04:37:02,820 --> 04:37:04,660
Maybe two teams this time.

9730
04:37:04,900 --> 04:37:06,040
Maybe two teams this time.

9731
04:37:06,040 --> 04:37:08,960
I'll go right side.

9732
04:37:09,460 --> 04:37:12,220
I'll go right side.

9733
04:37:13,120 --> 04:37:13,360

04:37:36,640 --> 04:37:37,640
We can fight.

9746
04:37:45,320 --> 04:37:46,180
This is it.

9747
04:37:47,560 --> 04:37:47,960

9748
04:37:50,280 --> 04:37:50,840
Okay.

Nice.

9750
04:37:53,780 --> 04:37:54,880
They are charge rifle.

9751
04:37:54,980 --> 04:37:55,460
They have shit guns.

9752
04:37:56,840 --> 04:37:57,400
36.

9753
04:37:58,900 --> 04:37:59,460
Okay.

9754
04:38:01,100 --> 04:38:02,280
Their guns are shit.

9755
04:38:06,990 --> 04:38:07,810
Oh fuck.

9756
04:38:07,890 --> 04:38:08,170
Okay.

9757
04:38:09,730 --> 04:38:10,290
Whoa.

9758
04:38:10,290 --> 04:38:10,850
Careful.

9759
04:38:12,510 --> 04:38:13,070
Okay.

9760
04:38:14,930 --> 04:38:15,830
Are you sure?

9761
04:38:15,890 --> 04:38:17,090
Are you sure?

9762
04:38:17,290 --> 04:38:18,190
Are you sure it's okay?

9763
04:38:18,430 --> 04:38:19,370
Are you sure?

9764
04:38:21,390 --> 04:38:23,910
I don't feel okay anymore.

9765
04:38:25,750 --> 04:38:26,790
He's so low.

9766
04:38:27,030 --> 04:38:30,070
Oh they are all so low.

9767
04:38:32,050 --> 04:38:33,050
They are all low.

9768
04:38:34,650 --> 04:38:35,210
No.

9769
04:38:35,390 --> 04:38:35,390
No.

9770
04:38:35,390 --> 04:38:35,930
No.

9771
04:38:35,930 --> 04:38:36,210
Not

9772
04:38:40,270 --> 04:38:40,670
this.

9773
04:38:41,330 --> 04:38:41,890
No.

9774
04:38:41,990 --> 04:38:42,890
My first blood.

9775
04:38:45,480 --> 04:38:46,800
What's going on?

9776
04:38:47,760 --> 04:38:48,580
I think we got swapped.

9777
04:38:48,680 --> 04:38:50,400
You know the server is cursed.

9778
04:38:50,720 --> 04:38:52,300
The server is cursed.

9779
04:38:55,980 --> 04:38:56,580
Ditto.

9780
04:38:56,720 --> 04:38:58,200
Pick us another server.

9781
04:38:58,440 --> 04:38:59,560
This is a cursed server.

9782
04:39:00,800 --> 04:39:01,740
Cursed server.

9783
04:39:02,040 --> 04:39:02,640
I see.

9784
04:39:02,900 --> 04:39:03,320
Yeah.

9785
04:39:03,320 --> 04:39:03,640
Yeah.

9786
04:39:03,640 --> 04:39:03,780
Yeah.

9787
04:39:03,820 --> 04:39:05,940
We go find another server.

9788
04:39:07,680 --> 04:39:08,500
Which one?

9789
04:39:08,880 --> 04:39:09,480
Ditto.

9790
04:39:09,680 --> 04:39:10,880
Surprise us.

9791
04:39:10,920 --> 04:39:11,400
Surprise.

9792
04:39:12,760 --> 04:39:13,960
Your server?

9793
04:39:14,700 --> 04:39:15,520
My server?

9794
04:39:15,800 --> 04:39:16,140
Okay.

9795
04:39:17,760 --> 04:39:17,940
Alright.

9796
04:39:18,160 --> 04:39:18,160
Alright.

9797
04:39:18,920 --> 04:39:20,140
We'll use my server.

9798
04:39:20,380 --> 04:39:20,460
Okay.

9799
04:39:21,340 --> 04:39:21,860
Okay.

9800
04:39:23,640 --> 04:39:24,160
Okay.

9801
04:39:24,500 --> 04:39:25,220
Which one?

9802
04:39:25,300 --> 04:39:25,640
Which one?

9803
04:39:25,680 --> 04:39:27,180
I will join.

9804
04:39:27,260 --> 04:39:27,820
I will join.

9805
04:39:27,940 --> 04:39:28,240
Yeah.

9806
04:39:28,240 --> 04:39:28,580
Yeah.

9807
04:39:28,580 --> 04:39:29,200
You join me.

9808
04:39:31,400 --> 04:39:31,920
Okay.

9809
04:39:32,160 --> 04:39:32,680
Yeah.

9810
04:39:34,880 --> 04:39:35,820
Come here.

9811
04:39:37,140 --> 04:39:37,960
I can't join.

9812
04:39:39,160 --> 04:39:39,680
Alright.

9813
04:39:41,520 --> 04:39:42,760
I want you.

9814
04:39:44,280 --> 04:39:45,160
This is it.

9815
04:39:46,860 --> 04:39:47,400
Alright.

9816
04:39:47,500 --> 04:39:47,960
Here we go.

9817
04:39:49,340 --> 04:39:49,880
Okay.

9818
04:39:50,000 --> 04:39:50,360
Okay.

9819
04:39:50,460 --> 04:39:50,760
Okay.

9820
04:39:50,960 --> 04:39:51,260
Alright.

9821
04:39:51,400 --> 04:39:51,960
This is it.

9822
04:39:52,040 --> 04:39:53,140
We're not cursed.

9823
04:39:53,520 --> 04:39:55,200
We can't be cursed anymore.

9824
04:39:55,780 --> 04:39:57,200
We can't be cursed.

9825
04:40:00,500 --> 04:40:02,160
This changes everything.

9826
04:40:03,020 --> 04:40:03,660
This changes everything.

9827
04:40:05,200 --> 04:40:06,220
Oh my god.

9828
04:40:06,240 --> 04:40:08,220
There's so little people in the ring.

9829
04:40:09,300 --> 04:40:09,960
Oh my god.

9830
04:40:09,960 --> 04:40:09,960
There's so little people in the ring.

9831
04:40:10,060 --> 04:40:11,180
What the fuck?

9832
04:40:11,700 --> 04:40:12,780
Where are you guys?

9833
04:40:13,300 --> 04:40:14,340
Fifteen people.

9834
04:40:14,420 --> 04:40:15,140
Why is there fifteen people?

9835
04:40:15,160 --> 04:40:18,600
It's the prime time ring.

9836
04:40:18,940 --> 04:40:19,400
It's the prime time ring.

9837
04:40:19,400 --> 04:40:21,340
Every hour is prime time.

9838
04:40:22,620 --> 04:40:23,360
Every hour is prime time.

9839
04:40:23,360 --> 04:40:25,580
What time is it now?

9840
04:40:25,820 --> 04:40:27,120
It's like 1143.

9841
04:40:28,780 --> 04:40:30,060
It's like 1143.

9842
04:40:30,060 --> 04:40:31,040
Gamers don't sleep.

9843
04:40:31,040 --> 04:40:31,220
Yeah.

9844
04:40:31,400 --> 04:40:32,440
Gamers don't sleep.

9845
04:40:32,600 --> 04:40:33,100
Exactly.

9846
04:40:33,620 --> 04:40:34,200
Guys.

9847
04:40:34,400 --> 04:40:35,980
Gamers do not sleep.

9848
04:40:36,280 --> 04:40:40,140
And because gamers do not sleep, every hour is prime time.

9849
04:40:40,840 --> 04:40:42,060
I see.

9850
04:40:42,060 --> 04:40:42,700
Yeah.

9851
04:40:42,820 --> 04:40:43,140
Yeah.

9852
04:40:43,600 --> 04:40:46,320
Every hour people play ranked.

9853
04:40:48,960 --> 04:40:51,400
There's no such thing as downtime.

9854
04:40:53,840 --> 04:40:56,420
The season literally came out two days ago.

9855
04:40:56,520 --> 04:40:57,680
People will still be grinding.

9856
04:41:01,000 --> 04:41:01,960
So fast.

9857
04:41:02,260 --> 04:41:03,340
I wish you were a rookie.

9858
04:41:03,540 --> 04:41:05,420
So why are you on his face?

9859
04:41:10,840 --> 04:41:11,940
It's my fault.

9860
04:41:12,020 --> 04:41:13,080
It's my fault.

9861
04:41:13,320 --> 04:41:13,800
It's my fault.

9862
04:41:19,760 --> 04:41:22,040
Too many people grinded.

9863
04:41:22,120 --> 04:41:22,720
Ranking.

9864
04:41:32,200 --> 04:41:33,340
This is it.

9865
04:41:34,560 --> 04:41:36,360
It's gonna be different now.

9866
04:41:41,690 --> 04:41:42,530
Ah fuck.

9867
04:41:42,610 --> 04:41:42,830
Okay.

9868
04:41:42,970 --> 04:41:43,670
No, don't worry.

9869
04:41:43,790 --> 04:41:44,330
It'll be different.

9870
04:41:44,630 --> 04:41:46,030
It's not that different.

9871
04:41:46,450 --> 04:41:47,290
It'll be different.

9872
04:41:47,590 --> 04:41:49,110
It'll be so different.

9873
04:41:50,110 --> 04:41:50,610
Trust.

9874
04:42:00,090 --> 04:42:00,990
Same spot.

9875
04:42:01,270 --> 04:42:01,670
Okay.

9876
04:42:01,850 --> 04:42:02,490
Count down.

9877
04:42:02,590 --> 04:42:04,530
We never lose countdown except last game.

9878
04:42:04,790 --> 04:42:04,790
No.

9879
04:42:04,790 --> 04:42:05,430
We never lose.

9880
04:42:07,270 --> 04:42:09,070
I was lagging.

9881
04:42:09,470 --> 04:42:09,970
Yeah.

9882
04:42:10,110 --> 04:42:10,310
Yeah.

9883
04:42:10,350 --> 04:42:12,270
Now you're gonna be lagging even more.

9884
04:42:17,650 --> 04:42:18,650
One team.

9885
04:42:18,710 --> 04:42:18,990
One team.

9886
04:42:19,110 --> 04:42:19,570
One team?

9887
04:42:19,730 --> 04:42:20,150
Oh yeah.

9888
04:42:20,190 --> 04:42:20,650
Above us.

9889
04:42:20,650 --> 04:42:20,930
Yeah.

9890
04:42:20,930 --> 04:42:21,370
Yeah.

9891
04:42:21,370 --> 04:42:21,690
Yeah.

9892
04:42:24,470 --> 04:42:28,050
They are landing far.

9893
04:42:28,810 --> 04:42:29,810
We can land close.

9894
04:42:30,170 --> 04:42:30,790
I land here.

9895
04:42:33,130 --> 04:42:34,670
One guy near me.

9896
04:42:34,890 --> 04:42:37,070
But I can't... I'm gonna go kill him.

9897
04:42:37,430 --> 04:42:38,890
Okay, you're gonna go kill him?

9898
04:42:39,470 --> 04:42:41,090
What if you don't kill him?

9899
04:42:43,390 --> 04:42:44,430
Missed kick.

9900
04:42:48,410 --> 04:42:49,670
I'm making a kayak.

9901
04:42:50,390 --> 04:42:51,090
Coming over.

9902
04:42:52,830 --> 04:42:55,670
Okay, I got power and nemesis.

9903
04:42:55,750 --> 04:42:56,210
Nice.

9904
04:42:56,410 --> 04:42:57,590
You want us to come over?

9905
04:42:59,990 --> 04:43:00,590
Over there?

9906
04:43:01,070 --> 04:43:02,670
I'm gonna craft the bat real fast.

9907
04:43:07,900 --> 04:43:10,280
I'm gonna head from... I'm heading this side.

9908
04:43:10,340 --> 04:43:10,940
I'm going right side.

9909
04:43:13,760 --> 04:43:14,220
Whoa!

9910
04:43:14,220 --> 04:43:14,680
Careful!

9911
04:43:14,980 --> 04:43:15,640
Don't die.

9912
04:43:21,580 --> 04:43:22,260
Coming over.

9913
04:43:22,540 --> 04:43:22,980
Go go!

9914
04:43:27,180 --> 04:43:27,620
Whoa!

9915
04:43:28,000 --> 04:43:29,120
Are they pushing you or no?

9916
04:43:29,540 --> 04:43:30,520
No, not yet.

9917
04:43:30,740 --> 04:43:31,180
Okay.

9918
04:43:31,600 --> 04:43:32,640
They're still inside.

9919
04:43:33,140 --> 04:43:34,220
I'm looking for you.

9920
04:43:35,920 --> 04:43:36,540
They're pushing!

9921
04:43:36,640 --> 04:43:36,820
They're pushing!

9922
04:43:36,880 --> 04:43:37,180
They're pushing!

9923
04:43:37,180 --> 04:43:37,500
They're pushing!

9924
04:43:38,120 --> 04:43:39,780
They're pushing you!

9925
04:43:41,140 --> 04:43:41,580
Okay.

9928
04:43:47,480 --> 04:43:47,920
Whoa!

9939
04:43:57,800 --> 04:43:58,220
Only two.

9940
04:43:58,880 --> 04:43:59,780
Let me know they're res.

9941
04:43:59,800 --> 04:44:00,420
Let me know they're resing.

9942
04:44:01,160 --> 04:44:01,960
They're resing.

9943
04:44:02,020 --> 04:44:02,140
They're resing.

9944
04:44:02,140 --> 04:44:02,240
Okay.

9952
04:44:08,970 --> 04:44:09,510
Last one.

9953
04:44:09,510 --> 04:44:09,850
Last one.

9954
04:44:11,090 --> 04:44:11,570

04:44:17,770 --> 04:44:19,590
We never lose countdown.

9960
04:44:19,910 --> 04:44:20,930
I told you.

9961
04:44:21,030 --> 04:44:21,390
We lose countdown.

9962
04:44:22,450 --> 04:44:22,930
Yeah.

9963
04:44:23,390 --> 04:44:23,870

9964
04:44:23,870 --> 04:44:24,630
They always...

9965
04:44:24,630 --> 04:44:27,250
They always push GB.

9966
04:44:27,430 --> 04:44:27,610
Why?

9967
04:44:28,930 --> 04:44:30,810
Cuz you're big and fat.

9968
04:44:31,050 --> 04:44:31,530
They're like...

9969
04:44:33,730 --> 04:44:34,950
They're like, look at you.

9970
04:44:35,050 --> 04:44:35,850
So juicy!

Yeah.

9972
04:44:39,370 --> 04:44:40,290
Skyhook I hear.

9973
04:44:40,430 --> 04:44:42,790
I want to check over Skyhook.

9974
04:44:43,310 --> 04:44:44,350
Are you going to go third?

9975
04:44:44,850 --> 04:44:45,890
Yeah, let's go third.

9976
04:44:46,570 --> 04:44:47,130
Okay.

9977
04:44:47,550 --> 04:44:48,570
They have nothing.

9978
04:44:49,750 --> 04:44:51,570
They only have one area.

9979
04:44:54,630 --> 04:44:55,970
Can you open up for me?

9980
04:44:57,850 --> 04:44:59,390
Yeah, I'll go scout.

9981
04:44:59,530 --> 04:44:59,990
I'll scout.

9982
04:45:00,250 --> 04:45:01,650
Okay, you go scout.

9983
04:45:05,670 --> 04:45:07,210
Never lose countdown.

9984
04:45:11,610 --> 04:45:13,510
Okay, I will use speed fire.

9985
04:45:16,530 --> 04:45:18,290
I'm trying to figure out where they are.

9986
04:45:19,170 --> 04:45:20,310
I don't see them.

9987
04:45:21,210 --> 04:45:22,510
I don't know if they finished?

9988
04:45:22,510 --> 04:45:22,950
Finished?

9989
04:45:24,730 --> 04:45:25,510
Oh, army?

9990
04:45:26,610 --> 04:45:27,010
Okay.

9991
04:45:28,370 --> 04:45:29,190
Going, going.

9992
04:45:31,110 --> 04:45:31,970
Yeah, yeah, they are behind.

9993
04:45:32,030 --> 04:45:33,610
No, no, that's why.

9994
04:45:33,790 --> 04:45:33,990
Fuck.

9995
04:45:34,090 --> 04:45:34,970
Okay, I'm backing up.

9996
04:45:35,030 --> 04:45:35,290
Backing up.

9997
04:45:35,330 --> 04:45:35,630
Backing up.

9998
04:45:35,950 --> 04:45:36,750
Okay, okay, okay.

9999
04:45:36,970 --> 04:45:39,470
Okay, you don't need to.

10000
04:45:39,470 --> 04:45:39,710
Never mind.

10001
04:45:40,070 --> 04:45:40,830
Cover us.

10002
04:45:40,970 --> 04:45:41,270
Cover us.

10003
04:45:43,950 --> 04:45:46,550

04:45:49,970 --> 04:45:51,090
Oh my god.

10006
04:45:51,170 --> 04:45:51,550
Shit.

10007
04:45:52,510 --> 04:45:52,970
Chill.

10008
04:45:54,970 --> 04:45:55,870
Oh my god.

04:46:01,230 --> 04:46:03,050
Oh my god.

10014
04:46:03,210 --> 04:46:03,630
Okay.

10015
04:46:06,710 --> 04:46:07,270
Fuck.

10016
04:46:07,490 --> 04:46:08,030
I'm low.

10017
04:46:09,910 --> 04:46:10,890
Oh, I'm dead.

10018
04:46:11,010 --> 04:46:11,310
No!

10019
04:46:12,470 --> 04:46:13,030
No!

10020
04:46:16,690 --> 04:46:17,810
Holy shit.

04:46:19,190 --> 04:46:20,830
You got beamed so fast.

10023
04:46:21,450 --> 04:46:23,250
I got beamed because I'm fat.

10024
04:46:23,470 --> 04:46:23,710
Okay.

10025
04:46:23,850 --> 04:46:25,470
Wait, why you not get me?

10026
04:46:26,790 --> 04:46:27,610
Wait, wait, wait.

04:46:27,970 --> 04:46:28,490
I know.

10028
04:46:28,810 --> 04:46:29,390
Okay, okay.

10029
04:46:29,510 --> 04:46:30,170
I'm gonna play Kha'Zix.

10030
04:46:30,250 --> 04:46:30,850
You play Rev.

10031
04:46:30,990 --> 04:46:31,510
This is it.

10032
04:46:31,550 --> 04:46:32,050
This is the comp.

10033
04:46:32,750 --> 04:46:33,110
Why?

10034
04:46:33,210 --> 04:46:33,910
I believe in you.

10035
04:46:33,990 --> 04:46:34,390
No, no.

10036
04:46:34,550 --> 04:46:35,770
No, I believe in you.

10037
04:46:35,890 --> 04:46:38,110
I believe in you and Rev.

10038
04:46:38,330 --> 04:46:39,930
I believe in you.

10039
04:46:40,630 --> 04:46:42,030
You're so good at Rev.

10040
04:46:42,710 --> 04:46:43,070
I...

10041
04:46:45,970 --> 04:46:47,310
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10042
04:46:47,510 --> 04:46:49,470
You got... I believe in you so hard.

10043
04:46:49,690 --> 04:46:51,090
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10044
04:46:51,690 --> 04:46:52,470
You can do this.

10045
04:46:54,730 --> 04:46:55,090
Why?

10046
04:46:55,110 --> 04:46:55,490
This is it.

10047
04:46:56,010 --> 04:46:56,430
This is it.

10048
04:46:56,570 --> 04:46:57,090
I swear.

10049
04:46:57,270 --> 04:46:57,770
I swear.

10050
04:46:58,010 --> 04:47:00,250
Your Rev is gonna be so hot.

10051
04:47:00,850 --> 04:47:01,290
Okay.

10052
04:47:02,150 --> 04:47:03,290
Wait, Utho, no!

10053
04:47:04,550 --> 04:47:05,430
Utho, no!

10054
04:47:06,490 --> 04:47:06,670
No!

10055
04:47:08,170 --> 04:47:08,630
Oh, no!

10056
04:47:08,930 --> 04:47:09,870
Okay, it's okay.

10057
04:47:09,930 --> 04:47:10,710
We can leave this.

10058
04:47:11,570 --> 04:47:12,030
Oh, no.

10059
04:47:12,130 --> 04:47:12,430
Wait.

10060
04:47:12,770 --> 04:47:14,890
I think she still can connect.

10061
04:47:15,230 --> 04:47:15,950
No, I don't think so.

10062
04:47:16,190 --> 04:47:17,590
If she can't connect by...

10063
04:47:17,590 --> 04:47:18,170
Oh, nice!

10064
04:47:18,230 --> 04:47:19,670
Nice, nice, nice.

10065
04:47:21,590 --> 04:47:22,030
Oh.

10066
04:47:22,650 --> 04:47:23,210
Oh.

10067
04:47:24,230 --> 04:47:25,310
It'll be different.

10068
04:47:25,470 --> 04:47:26,030
I swear.

10069
04:47:37,120 --> 04:47:37,680
Oh.

10070
04:47:38,140 --> 04:47:39,060
I believe.

10071
04:47:39,180 --> 04:47:40,160
I believe.

10072
04:47:40,840 --> 04:47:41,400
Okay.

10073
04:47:43,420 --> 04:47:45,060
For the first time, I'll jump.

10074
04:47:45,620 --> 04:47:46,520
We'll do here.

10075
04:47:47,000 --> 04:47:47,480
This is a good spot.

10076
04:47:49,980 --> 04:47:50,540
Trust.

10077
04:47:51,360 --> 04:47:52,120
One body.

10078
04:47:54,120 --> 04:47:55,040
Wait, is it one?

10079
04:47:55,120 --> 04:47:55,240
Two.

10080
04:47:55,260 --> 04:47:55,260
Three.

10081
04:47:55,380 --> 04:47:55,820
Three?

10082
04:47:56,120 --> 04:47:56,680
Three?

10083
04:47:56,880 --> 04:47:58,560
Okay, I'm landing here.

10084
04:48:01,040 --> 04:48:02,740
That is way too many.

10085
04:48:02,860 --> 04:48:03,880
Wait, we're contested.

10086
04:48:04,580 --> 04:48:05,400
What the fuck?

10087
04:48:06,340 --> 04:48:07,340
They come with us.

10088
04:48:07,580 --> 04:48:08,040
Yeah, yeah.

10089
04:48:08,100 --> 04:48:09,160
They contested us.

10090
04:48:09,660 --> 04:48:10,280
You're by yourself.

10091
04:48:10,380 --> 04:48:10,680
You're by yourself.

10092
04:48:12,580 --> 04:48:14,060
I don't have any gun.

10093
04:48:14,280 --> 04:48:15,620
Come to us.

10094
04:48:15,640 --> 04:48:16,000
Jump to us.

10095
04:48:16,000 --> 04:48:16,380
Jump to us.

10096
04:48:16,400 --> 04:48:16,880
I can kill you.

10097
04:48:19,120 --> 04:48:19,720
You're fine.

10098
04:48:19,760 --> 04:48:19,980
You're fine.

10099
04:48:20,020 --> 04:48:20,280
You're fine.

10100
04:48:20,400 --> 04:48:20,980
Oh, the fuck.

10101
04:48:21,540 --> 04:48:22,500
I don't have anything.

10102
04:48:24,220 --> 04:48:24,940
I cracked one.

10103
04:48:25,820 --> 04:48:26,400
Nice one.

10104
04:48:29,320 --> 04:48:30,140
I cracked the other.

10105
04:48:30,780 --> 04:48:31,140
Okay.

10106
04:48:32,100 --> 04:48:33,300
Okay, I will go with punch.

10107
04:48:34,100 --> 04:48:34,460
Okay.

10108
04:48:37,160 --> 04:48:37,880
What the fuck?

10109
04:48:39,760 --> 04:48:40,400
Okay, okay.

10110
04:48:40,680 --> 04:48:42,080
They're scared of pushing right now.

10111
04:48:44,460 --> 04:48:45,180
What the fuck?

10112
04:48:45,380 --> 04:48:46,600
We can back up.

10113
04:48:46,660 --> 04:48:47,120
We can back up.

10114
04:48:47,360 --> 04:48:47,820
Back up.

10115
04:48:47,880 --> 04:48:48,080
Back up.

10116
04:48:48,100 --> 04:48:48,320
Back up.

10117
04:48:48,420 --> 04:48:49,120
I have a gun.

10118
04:48:49,300 --> 04:48:49,820
You have a gun?

10119
04:48:49,960 --> 04:48:50,400
Okay, okay.

10120
04:48:50,440 --> 04:48:51,240
Then we can fight this.

10121
04:48:56,230 --> 04:48:57,650
I want to just back up.

10122
04:48:58,970 --> 04:48:59,330
Okay.

10123
04:48:59,510 --> 04:49:00,250
They don't have...

10124
04:49:02,150 --> 04:49:03,270
They should not have...

10125
04:49:03,270 --> 04:49:07,970
They don't have enough heals to fight us because I cracked them like three times.

10126
04:49:11,350 --> 04:49:11,890
Yeah, okay.

10127
04:49:11,950 --> 04:49:12,610
I cracked them again.

10128
04:49:13,410 --> 04:49:15,610
Wait, I might be able to crack them again.

10129
04:49:19,270 --> 04:49:20,470
Yeah, I'll give you...

10130
04:49:21,870 --> 04:49:22,810
They have casting.

10131
04:49:23,410 --> 04:49:24,110
I'll give you.

10132
04:49:24,670 --> 04:49:27,310
Yeah, but they should have heals because I cracked them so many times.

10133
04:49:28,830 --> 04:49:30,970
There's no way Wait, they found enough shield cells.

10134
04:49:31,090 --> 04:49:31,730
Are they still inside?

10135
04:49:32,070 --> 04:49:32,410
Yeah.

10136
04:49:35,270 --> 04:49:35,970
Are they?

10137
04:49:36,730 --> 04:49:37,250
No!

10138
04:49:37,350 --> 04:49:38,130
Oh, they left.

10139
04:49:38,170 --> 04:49:38,610
Yeah, bitch!

10140
04:49:39,710 --> 04:49:40,230
What?

10141
04:49:41,850 --> 04:49:42,830
Alright, let's loot.

10142
04:49:43,110 --> 04:49:43,590
Let's loot.

10143
04:49:44,210 --> 04:49:44,730
Okay.

10144
04:49:45,210 --> 04:49:45,730
Stupid.

10145
04:49:48,910 --> 04:49:49,710
Okay, okay.

10146
04:49:49,990 --> 04:49:51,030
Let's go loot that.

10147
04:49:51,150 --> 04:49:51,410
That's right.

10148
04:49:51,710 --> 04:49:53,670
This is what happens when I have...

10149
04:49:54,290 --> 04:49:55,250
30 ping.

10150
04:49:55,630 --> 04:49:57,450
Or 60 ping.

10151
04:50:05,320 --> 04:50:06,000
Alright.

10152
04:50:06,300 --> 04:50:09,360
Did they finish shooting each other?

10153
04:50:10,840 --> 04:50:11,520
Okay.

10154
04:50:12,180 --> 04:50:13,820
I'm gonna go with you, Ditto.

10155
04:50:16,820 --> 04:50:18,120
No one with me.

10156
04:50:18,160 --> 04:50:18,900
Yeah, no one...

10157
04:50:21,760 --> 04:50:24,000
It's not like, fucking double A.

10158
04:50:26,720 --> 04:50:27,900
Oh, right here.

10159
04:50:28,060 --> 04:50:29,400
Light magazine.

10160
04:50:29,860 --> 04:50:30,400
Oh, nice.

10161
04:50:30,680 --> 04:50:31,360
Enemy?

10162
04:50:33,480 --> 04:50:33,600
Yeah.

10163
04:50:33,660 --> 04:50:34,120
Okay.

10164
04:50:35,560 --> 04:50:36,240
Alright.

10165
04:50:36,680 --> 04:50:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

10166
04:50:37,000 --> 04:50:38,180
He's so, so close.

10167
04:50:38,280 --> 04:50:38,540
So close.

10168
04:50:39,060 --> 04:50:39,420
What?

10169
04:50:39,440 --> 04:50:39,700
Really?

10170
04:50:39,740 --> 04:50:39,920
Where?

10171
04:50:40,200 --> 04:50:40,860

10172
04:50:40,920 --> 04:50:41,280
On my left.

10173
04:50:41,420 --> 04:50:41,640
Here.

10174
04:50:41,720 --> 04:50:42,020
Oh, no.

10175
04:50:42,140 --> 04:50:42,500
Behind.

10176
04:50:42,860 --> 04:50:43,480
He followed me.

10177
04:50:45,080 --> 04:50:45,600
I'm looking.

10178
04:50:46,880 --> 04:50:47,640
I cack one.

10179
04:50:47,800 --> 04:50:48,140
Solo.

10180
04:50:48,160 --> 04:50:48,680
Okay, I got you.

10181
04:50:50,280 --> 04:50:51,000
Let me...

10182
04:50:52,840 --> 04:50:54,520
We can push this guy.

10183
04:50:54,720 --> 04:50:55,280
He's by himself.

10184
04:50:55,460 --> 04:50:55,580
Okay.

10185
04:50:56,140 --> 04:50:57,020
I'll cover you guys.

10186
04:50:57,320 --> 04:50:57,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10187
04:50:58,000 --> 04:50:59,020
His teammates are so far.

10188
04:50:59,080 --> 04:50:59,880
His teammates are really far.

10189
04:51:02,460 --> 04:51:03,620
You guys push him.

10190
04:51:03,700 --> 04:51:04,160
You guys push him.

10191
04:51:04,240 --> 04:51:04,420
He's high.

10192
04:51:04,540 --> 04:51:05,100
I'll cover.

10193
04:51:05,240 --> 04:51:05,460
I'll cover.

10194
04:51:05,740 --> 04:51:06,260
They're coming.

10195
04:51:06,280 --> 04:51:06,560
They're coming.

10196
04:51:06,660 --> 04:51:06,820
They're coming.

10197
04:51:06,860 --> 04:51:07,840
Come back.

10198
04:51:07,960 --> 04:51:08,080
Come back.

10199
04:51:08,080 --> 04:51:08,200
Come back.

10200
04:51:08,820 --> 04:51:09,100
Ditto.

10201
04:51:09,200 --> 04:51:09,760
The teammates are here.

10202
04:51:09,800 --> 04:51:10,180
The teammates are here.

10203
04:51:11,120 --> 04:51:12,060
The teammates are here.

10204
04:51:12,060 --> 04:51:12,220
Ditto.

10205
04:51:13,360 --> 04:51:13,640
Okay.

10206
04:51:16,660 --> 04:51:17,160
Oh, no.

10207
04:51:17,780 --> 04:51:18,060
Flash.

10208
04:51:19,780 --> 04:51:20,060
MadMaggie1.

10209
04:51:20,380 --> 04:51:20,660
MadMaggie1.

10210
04:51:22,200 --> 04:51:22,480
Okay.

10211
04:51:23,060 --> 04:51:23,600
Okay, I'm looking.

10212
04:51:23,740 --> 04:51:24,020
I'm covering.

10213
04:51:28,030 --> 04:51:28,570
Careful, Ditto.

10214
04:51:29,850 --> 04:51:30,390
There's a cool heal.

10215
04:51:30,450 --> 04:51:31,690
I can cover from outside here.

10216
04:51:31,830 --> 04:51:32,490
I don't have...

10217
04:51:32,490 --> 04:51:32,990
I don't have...

10218
04:51:32,990 --> 04:51:33,710
I don't have...

10219
04:51:33,710 --> 04:51:33,770
I don't have...

10220
04:51:34,190 --> 04:51:34,750
Oh, okay.

10221
04:51:34,830 --> 04:51:35,210
That's bad.

10222
04:51:35,310 --> 04:51:35,690
Jump to me.

10223
04:51:35,930 --> 04:51:36,530
I can Q you.

10224
04:51:36,630 --> 04:51:36,750
Okay.

10225
04:51:41,370 --> 04:51:41,770
Okay.

10226
04:51:41,770 --> 04:51:42,510
I have cells.

10227
04:51:42,630 --> 04:51:43,530
So you can jump to me.

10228
04:51:45,670 --> 04:51:46,070
Oh.

10229
04:51:46,090 --> 04:51:46,750
He's so low.

10230
04:51:47,150 --> 04:51:47,270
Yeah.

10231
04:51:47,310 --> 04:51:47,610
Jump to me.

10232
04:51:47,630 --> 04:51:47,970
Jump to me.

10233
04:51:48,030 --> 04:51:48,490
You're low.

10234
04:51:48,690 --> 04:51:49,610
You guys don't have heals.

10235
04:51:50,610 --> 04:51:51,210
I have...

10236
04:52:00,170 --> 04:52:02,130
No cell here.

10237
04:52:03,630 --> 04:52:04,830
I dropped two for you.

10238
04:52:05,570 --> 04:52:06,370
They're getting...

10239
04:52:10,420 --> 04:52:11,700
I have Q and 3.

10240
04:52:11,880 --> 04:52:13,180
Oh, he's so low.

10241
04:52:13,580 --> 04:52:14,560
They're all so low.

10242
04:52:18,280 --> 04:52:19,760
Oh, I can't give you the Q.

10243
04:52:21,140 --> 04:52:22,400
There's a guy right here.

10244
04:52:23,420 --> 04:52:25,480
Oh no, Ditto, your spy is down.

10245
04:52:25,700 --> 04:52:26,340
Ditto, no!

10246
04:52:27,640 --> 04:52:28,980
Ditto, he's so low!

10247
04:52:29,560 --> 04:52:30,660
Leave, leave, leave.

10248
04:52:31,640 --> 04:52:32,780
Leave, leave, leave.

10249
04:52:33,260 --> 04:52:35,880
Good Ditto, that's three people!

10250
04:52:35,880 --> 04:52:39,800
That's three people!

10251
04:52:40,300 --> 04:52:40,420
You're crazy!

10252
04:52:40,420 --> 04:52:42,040
I love cheap people!

10253
04:52:42,920 --> 04:52:44,460
You're crazy!

10254
04:52:45,920 --> 04:52:50,160
I don't have any magazine.

10255
04:52:51,100 --> 04:52:52,740
Oh my god, you're insane.

10256
04:52:54,670 --> 04:52:56,300
You try to win.

10257
04:52:59,360 --> 04:53:03,880
Oh my god, Utho is so poor right now.

10258
04:53:09,260 --> 04:53:10,320
She's starving.

10259
04:53:11,100 --> 04:53:14,140
Are you fucking... Oh my god!

10260
04:53:14,380 --> 04:53:20,940
They're redeployed.

10261
04:53:20,940 --> 04:53:22,140
Holy shit.

10262
04:53:22,340 --> 04:53:23,980
We don't have another redeploy though.

10263
04:53:26,080 --> 04:53:29,280
Oh, and I dropped my Phoenix Kit for you too.

10264
04:53:29,800 --> 04:53:32,880
I can't even craft you because they're chasing us.

10265
04:53:34,560 --> 04:53:35,860
Okay, there's only one.

10266
04:53:35,860 --> 04:53:36,800
There's only one thing I can do.

10267
04:53:36,980 --> 04:53:37,640
And it's this.

10268
04:53:38,680 --> 04:53:39,240
Boom.

10269
04:53:39,800 --> 04:53:41,360
I don't know if I'll hit.

10270
04:53:44,600 --> 04:53:46,200
Okay, the best... Okay.

10271
04:53:50,040 --> 04:53:51,580
Are you... Deadslide.

10272
04:53:51,680 --> 04:53:52,680
Ah, Deadslide!

10273
04:53:53,800 --> 04:53:54,360
Deadslide.

10274
04:53:54,360 --> 04:53:54,660
Go!

10275
04:53:54,860 --> 04:53:55,760
Live for us!

10276
04:53:56,420 --> 04:53:56,980
Live!

10277
04:53:57,720 --> 04:53:59,100
Oh wait, no, don't come to me.

10278
04:53:59,180 --> 04:53:59,260
No!

10279
04:53:59,540 --> 04:54:00,100
No!

10280
04:54:02,900 --> 04:54:04,380
I said live!

10281
04:54:04,380 --> 04:54:05,600
I said...

10282
04:54:06,380 --> 04:54:07,120
No!

10283
04:54:07,140 --> 04:54:09,420
No, I got Deadslide again!

10284
04:54:09,800 --> 04:54:09,920
No!

10285
04:54:10,120 --> 04:54:12,100
Jesus Christ.

10286
04:54:15,160 --> 04:54:16,860
I don't know.

10287
04:54:16,880 --> 04:54:17,820
I said live.

10288
04:54:18,980 --> 04:54:21,000
What happened to living?

10289
04:54:22,060 --> 04:54:23,900
You can save us, right?

10290
04:54:24,440 --> 04:54:25,660
I don't know.

10291
04:54:26,460 --> 04:54:31,300
This... This doesn't look very hopeful right now.

10292
04:54:33,080 --> 04:54:34,360
I literally...

10293
04:54:34,360 --> 04:54:37,680
I literally have not a lot of resources.

10294
04:54:41,750 --> 04:54:42,390
Alright.

10295
04:54:42,890 --> 04:54:43,830
You can do it.

10296
04:54:44,630 --> 04:54:44,950
Okay.

10297
04:54:45,270 --> 04:54:45,870
You can do it.

10298
04:54:45,890 --> 04:54:46,390
Okay.

10299
04:54:53,020 --> 04:54:53,660
Alright.

10300
04:54:55,040 --> 04:54:56,640
You can do it.

10301
04:54:56,920 --> 04:54:57,560
Alright.

10302
04:54:58,080 --> 04:54:59,600
You can do it.

10303
04:54:59,740 --> 04:55:01,800
You think they're gonna count me?

10304
04:55:02,020 --> 04:55:03,460
Let's find out!

10305
04:55:05,840 --> 04:55:06,160
Woah...

10306
04:55:06,480 --> 04:55:07,140
But I've been down.

10307
04:55:07,140 --> 04:55:12,060
I think there's still cause to us.

10308
04:55:14,220 --> 04:55:17,160
Alright, it's either I do this or I die.

10309
04:55:19,780 --> 04:55:21,120
Here we go.

10310
04:55:23,260 --> 04:55:23,780
Wait!

10311
04:55:23,840 --> 04:55:24,420
Wait, wait, wait.

10312
04:55:25,300 --> 04:55:26,980
First step, first step, first step.

10313
04:55:27,400 --> 04:55:28,900
Well, this is my last skill.

10314
04:55:38,280 --> 04:55:39,560
I know, I forgot.

10315
04:55:41,720 --> 04:55:43,720
What the heck?

10316
04:55:45,460 --> 04:55:46,820
How come you forgot?

10317
04:55:48,160 --> 04:55:49,840
Because you said footsteps!

10318
04:55:50,580 --> 04:55:52,320
So I panicked.

10319
04:55:53,900 --> 04:55:56,580
I was like, I heard footsteps?

10320
04:55:58,620 --> 04:56:01,380
And then I freaked out.

10321
04:56:01,400 --> 04:56:01,700
They are gone.

10322
04:56:04,840 --> 04:56:06,840
Nice signing.

10323
04:56:07,240 --> 04:56:08,020
One.

10324
04:56:14,240 --> 04:56:15,340
Better than nothing.

10325
04:56:15,560 --> 04:56:16,240
That's true.

10326
04:56:16,580 --> 04:56:17,260
That's true.

10327
04:56:17,380 --> 04:56:19,560
Alright, Okay, let's up here.

10328
04:56:19,640 --> 04:56:21,440
Look how far!

10329
04:56:21,680 --> 04:56:23,120
Oh my god.

10330
04:56:23,300 --> 04:56:24,520
I think we're gonna die.

10331
04:56:24,640 --> 04:56:25,180
We're gonna die.

10332
04:56:25,240 --> 04:56:25,980
We're gonna die in zone.

10333
04:56:26,200 --> 04:56:27,360
We're gonna die in zone.

10334
04:56:29,660 --> 04:56:30,960
We are not.

10335
04:56:31,060 --> 04:56:32,020
We are not.

10336
04:56:32,160 --> 04:56:32,640
Believe?

10337
04:56:32,900 --> 04:56:34,960
Okay, okay, we will not die in zone.

10338
04:56:35,140 --> 04:56:36,100
We will not.

10339
04:56:37,040 --> 04:56:38,000
We won't.

10340
04:56:38,000 --> 04:56:38,400
We won't.

10341
04:56:38,800 --> 04:56:40,540
Look how far the zone is.

10342
04:56:40,540 --> 04:56:41,240
What do you mean?

10343
04:56:41,440 --> 04:56:43,120
It's okay, I'm a Pathfinder.

10344
04:56:44,700 --> 04:56:45,940
You're right!

10345
04:56:46,290 --> 04:56:46,620
I have a slut.

10346
04:56:48,400 --> 04:56:49,320
Oh, I forgot.

10347
04:56:49,740 --> 04:56:51,380
What do you mean?

10348
04:56:51,640 --> 04:56:53,100
I'm Pathfinder.

10349
04:56:54,300 --> 04:56:56,620
I'm not Pathfinder.

10350
04:56:56,900 --> 04:56:57,560
I'm not Pathfinder.

10351
04:56:58,060 --> 04:56:59,520
I thought everyone was paying for Pathfinder.

10352
04:56:59,520 --> 04:57:01,820
Don't worry, I'm Pathfinder.

10353
04:57:04,400 --> 04:57:08,620
That makes me worry even more because you said I'm Pathfinder.

10354
04:57:10,980 --> 04:57:11,680
Why?

10355
04:57:14,120 --> 04:57:15,820
You guys better hurry.

10356
04:57:16,200 --> 04:57:17,180
This zone.

10357
04:57:18,250 --> 04:57:18,600
Okay.

10358
04:57:19,420 --> 04:57:20,120
Okay.

10359
04:57:20,720 --> 04:57:22,020
Oh no.

10360
04:57:23,780 --> 04:57:27,500
I feel like we are gonna get championed in this match.

10361
04:57:28,440 --> 04:57:32,180
I feel like somebody's gonna camp us right at this edge.

10362
04:57:32,320 --> 04:57:39,740
I can feel it.

10363
04:57:40,540 --> 04:57:43,880
I can feel that one team just waiting at the edge.

10364
04:57:44,580 --> 04:57:46,480
No, no, I don't feel it.

10365
04:57:46,600 --> 04:57:47,460
I feel it.

10366
04:57:47,460 --> 04:57:49,060
I feel it in my bones right now.

10367
04:57:49,080 --> 04:57:49,900
I can smell it too.

10368
04:57:50,460 --> 04:57:51,920
I feel it right now.

10369
04:57:52,980 --> 04:57:53,520
Okay.

10370
04:57:54,660 --> 04:57:55,640
We will see.

10371
04:57:56,420 --> 04:57:57,320
Okay, I'm seeing.

10372
04:57:58,180 --> 04:57:59,140
I'm seeing.

10373
04:57:59,700 --> 04:58:01,360
No, they're fighting each other.

10374
04:58:01,760 --> 04:58:03,840
They have no time for us.

10375
04:58:04,000 --> 04:58:05,800
They have no time for us.

10376
04:58:05,820 --> 04:58:06,580
They're too busy.

10377
04:58:08,420 --> 04:58:10,480
Maybe we can get into that building.

10378
04:58:10,940 --> 04:58:11,540
Alright.

10379
04:58:12,980 --> 04:58:13,620
Let's go.

10380
04:58:14,240 --> 04:58:15,940
I swear to god if...

10381
04:58:16,580 --> 04:58:17,880
I swear to god.

10382
04:58:20,640 --> 04:58:21,840
Oh, that's...

10383
04:58:21,840 --> 04:58:23,580
This has been...

10384
04:58:23,580 --> 04:58:26,520
This has been a very scuffed game.

10385
04:58:27,440 --> 04:58:27,680
This has been a very scuffed game.

10386
04:58:28,380 --> 04:58:29,620
Oh, we got...

10387
04:58:29,620 --> 04:58:30,880
We got inside the lane.

10388
04:58:32,920 --> 04:58:34,000
Oh my god.

10389
04:58:34,140 --> 04:58:35,580
One team so close.

10390
04:58:36,760 --> 04:58:37,200
Okay.

10391
04:58:37,440 --> 04:58:38,580
I'm trying to grab...

10392
04:58:38,580 --> 04:58:38,960
Have a point.

10393
04:58:39,060 --> 04:58:39,460
Have a point.

10394
04:58:40,820 --> 04:58:41,880
One more point.

10395
04:58:42,000 --> 04:58:44,520
Okay, I don't think I should bring it.

10396
04:58:44,580 --> 04:58:45,720
Have a point.

10397
04:58:46,400 --> 04:58:47,520
You should get it.

10398
04:58:47,620 --> 04:58:48,260
You should get it.

10399
04:58:48,620 --> 04:58:49,880
I don't have...

10400
04:58:49,880 --> 04:58:51,040
Wait, wait, wait.

10401
04:58:51,700 --> 04:58:52,660
Okay, I'm gonna...

10402
04:58:52,660 --> 04:58:54,540
Yeah, just take it.

10403
04:58:54,580 --> 04:58:55,120
Hold on to it.

10404
04:58:55,420 --> 04:58:56,280
Okay, okay, okay.

10405
04:58:58,080 --> 04:58:58,520
Okay.

10406
04:58:59,560 --> 04:59:00,620
I'm going to you.

10407
04:59:01,740 --> 04:59:03,540
There's so many people fighting around us.

10408
04:59:03,560 --> 04:59:04,080
I'm so scared.

10409
04:59:05,620 --> 04:59:06,060
Oh!

10410
04:59:06,580 --> 04:59:07,600
I'm gonna craft.

10411
04:59:08,900 --> 04:59:09,420
Oh!

10412
04:59:09,420 --> 04:59:09,940
Nice.

10413
04:59:10,460 --> 04:59:10,780
Nice.

10414
04:59:11,200 --> 04:59:12,100
I'll craft too.

10415
04:59:12,380 --> 04:59:13,060
We have craft.

10416
04:59:13,560 --> 04:59:14,660
You can...

10417
04:59:14,660 --> 04:59:15,900
You can?

10418
04:59:17,200 --> 04:59:17,900
Here we go.

10419
04:59:18,340 --> 04:59:19,680
How can you craft it?

10420
04:59:19,800 --> 04:59:21,000
You craft banner once.

10421
04:59:21,360 --> 04:59:22,240
No, each...

10422
04:59:22,240 --> 04:59:24,280
Each machine is one.

10423
04:59:25,040 --> 04:59:25,780
Oh, really?

10424
04:59:26,000 --> 04:59:26,320
Yeah, yeah.

10425
04:59:26,480 --> 04:59:27,700
It's not one whole game.

10426
04:59:27,700 --> 04:59:28,540
Oh, I thought no.

10427
04:59:29,020 --> 04:59:30,060
Wait, you didn't know?

10428
04:59:30,540 --> 04:59:31,600
I didn't know.

10429
04:59:31,660 --> 04:59:33,160
You didn't try to craft more?

10430
04:59:33,160 --> 04:59:33,520
I didn't know.

10431
04:59:36,150 --> 04:59:37,670
I didn't try to craft more.

10432
04:59:37,690 --> 04:59:38,150
You tried.

10433
04:59:38,250 --> 04:59:39,070
You only did one.

10434
04:59:39,230 --> 04:59:39,450
I don't know.

10435
04:59:41,310 --> 04:59:43,090
Maybe this is why we didn't craft more.

10436
04:59:43,090 --> 04:59:43,330
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10437
04:59:43,550 --> 04:59:44,010
I saw, I saw.

10438
04:59:44,550 --> 04:59:45,090
Wait, Forest?

10439
04:59:45,590 --> 04:59:47,270
Maybe this is why we didn't start getting...

10440
04:59:47,270 --> 04:59:47,570
Solo.

10441
04:59:47,590 --> 04:59:48,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10442
04:59:48,010 --> 04:59:48,290
He's solo.

10443
04:59:48,490 --> 04:59:49,290
Come on, feed us.

10444
04:59:49,690 --> 04:59:50,290
Feed us.

10445
04:59:50,950 --> 04:59:52,110
Okay, I'm gonna...

10446
04:59:52,110 --> 04:59:54,410
Okay, okay, I cracked him.

10447
04:59:54,510 --> 04:59:55,090
Yes, he's cracked.

10448
04:59:55,150 --> 04:59:55,390
He's cracked.

10449
04:59:56,030 --> 04:59:57,010
Okay, I'm going.

10450
04:59:57,130 --> 04:59:58,510
Go, go, go!

10451
04:59:59,130 --> 05:00:00,370
No, no, I cracked him.

10452
05:00:00,430 --> 05:00:01,070
Please kill him.

10453
05:00:01,770 --> 05:00:02,790
I want this!

10454
05:00:02,790 --> 05:00:06,000
I want this!

10455
05:00:08,040 --> 05:00:08,560
I want this!

10456
05:00:08,760 --> 05:00:09,160
Goodbye.

10457
05:00:14,540 --> 05:00:15,640
Oh my god!

10458
05:00:16,340 --> 05:00:17,560
What the fuck?

10459
05:00:17,840 --> 05:00:19,140
I know one, I know one.

10460
05:00:19,360 --> 05:00:21,560
Only one here.

10461
05:00:21,740 --> 05:00:22,820
Oh no, it's a full team.

10462
05:00:23,040 --> 05:00:23,820
It's a full team.

10463
05:00:23,940 --> 05:00:25,200
No, yeah, it's a full team.

10464
05:00:25,300 --> 05:00:26,520
It's a full team.

10465
05:00:32,340 --> 05:00:33,260
Holy shit.

10466
05:00:35,220 --> 05:00:36,240
I thought like, um...

10467
05:00:36,240 --> 05:00:37,220
Levernance.

10468
05:00:37,880 --> 05:00:39,820
But you down one!

10469
05:00:40,180 --> 05:00:41,640
But you down one.

10470
05:00:41,780 --> 05:00:42,540
What happened?

10471
05:00:45,220 --> 05:00:46,840
I don't know how to jump!

10472
05:00:47,240 --> 05:00:48,600
I don't know... I'm just playing.

10473
05:00:50,120 --> 05:00:54,700
There was a full team behind us that jumped after you.

10474
05:00:55,320 --> 05:00:56,000
Really?

10475
05:00:56,180 --> 05:00:56,660
Really?

10476
05:00:56,780 --> 05:00:57,900
I didn't think that.

10477
05:00:57,940 --> 05:00:58,340
Yeah.

10478
05:01:00,920 --> 05:01:01,940
Oh, man.

10479
05:01:01,940 --> 05:01:03,760
Can I craft anything?

10480
05:01:05,280 --> 05:01:06,480
Can I craft anything?

10481
05:01:06,480 --> 05:01:07,960
We have to find another one.

10482
05:01:08,360 --> 05:01:09,820
No, we don't have it.

10483
05:01:10,240 --> 05:01:11,380
There's no other one.

10484
05:01:11,580 --> 05:01:13,300
The only one is here.

10485
05:01:14,500 --> 05:01:15,740
Do you have a cell?

10486
05:01:16,120 --> 05:01:16,760
No!

10487
05:01:17,680 --> 05:01:19,360
Wait, let me use this.

10488
05:01:25,040 --> 05:01:26,100
It's important!

10489
05:01:26,640 --> 05:01:27,960
It's so important!

10490
05:01:30,100 --> 05:01:30,940
It's important!

10491
05:01:32,460 --> 05:01:34,740
You're gonna get us champion, right?

10492
05:01:34,900 --> 05:01:35,240
You're gonna get us champion, right?

10493
05:01:36,960 --> 05:01:37,560
Alright.

10494
05:01:37,800 --> 05:01:38,200
Alright.

10495
05:01:38,440 --> 05:01:38,940
I'm gonna leave.

10496
05:01:39,180 --> 05:01:40,700
What the fuck is that?

10497
05:01:40,900 --> 05:01:41,180
What the fuck is that?

10498
05:01:43,460 --> 05:01:44,060
What?

10499
05:01:45,700 --> 05:01:47,380
I didn't need that battery.

10500
05:01:47,600 --> 05:01:49,280
I did not need it.

10501
05:01:49,540 --> 05:01:51,580
I didn't need that battery.

10502
05:01:52,300 --> 05:01:53,620
Alright, here we go.

10503
05:01:56,460 --> 05:01:59,500
Alright, this is going to be awkward.

10504
05:01:59,680 --> 05:02:00,280
Alright, this is going to be awkward.

10505
05:02:00,280 --> 05:02:00,920
Guys, I don't know what to do.

10506
05:02:00,940 --> 05:02:01,120
I don't know.

10507
05:02:01,240 --> 05:02:02,980
I don't think we're gonna get champion.

10508
05:02:03,040 --> 05:02:03,940
I don't know.

10509
05:02:05,180 --> 05:02:05,900
It's okay.

10510
05:02:06,100 --> 05:02:06,380
It's okay.

10511
05:02:06,760 --> 05:02:07,800
We can do it.

10512
05:02:07,800 --> 05:02:08,540
Don't give up.

10513
05:02:09,000 --> 05:02:10,420
Just don't stop believing.

10514
05:02:11,580 --> 05:02:12,660
Don't stop.

10515
05:02:12,660 --> 05:02:13,220
Like you said.

10516
05:02:13,700 --> 05:02:14,340
You win.

10517
05:02:15,200 --> 05:02:15,780
Okay.

10518
05:02:16,940 --> 05:02:18,500
Don't stop believing.

10519
05:02:18,500 --> 05:02:19,100
They don't see.

10520
05:02:19,100 --> 05:02:19,760
They don't see.

10521
05:02:19,760 --> 05:02:20,440
Go here.

10522
05:02:24,980 --> 05:02:27,280
Don't stop believing.

10523
05:02:30,340 --> 05:02:30,920
Don't stop believing.

10524
05:02:30,920 --> 05:02:31,160
Woah.

10525
05:02:31,940 --> 05:02:32,580
Woah.

10526
05:02:33,320 --> 05:02:33,460
Woah.

10527
05:02:34,200 --> 05:02:35,320
They don't see.

10528
05:02:35,380 --> 05:02:36,060
They don't see.

10529
05:02:36,080 --> 05:02:36,640
They don't see.

10530
05:02:41,930 --> 05:02:45,550
Oh my god.

10531
05:02:45,570 --> 05:02:47,110
Why did they turn around?

10532
05:02:47,350 --> 05:02:49,110
Where did you come from?

10533
05:02:49,490 --> 05:02:51,350
Where did you come from?

10534
05:02:54,290 --> 05:02:54,930
Okay.

10535
05:02:55,430 --> 05:02:57,810
What the fuck?

10536
05:02:57,870 --> 05:02:58,270
Okay.

10537
05:02:58,970 --> 05:03:00,410
I feel like...

10538
05:03:00,410 --> 05:03:02,910
I feel like bad game.

10539
05:03:04,490 --> 05:03:06,110
That game we just played.

10540
05:03:06,170 --> 05:03:07,130
I don't know.

10541
05:03:07,150 --> 05:03:09,730
I didn't think we were gonna win that game.

10542
05:03:11,630 --> 05:03:12,110
I don't know.

10543
05:03:12,110 --> 05:03:12,110
I didn't think we were gonna win that game.

10544
05:03:12,510 --> 05:03:13,570
Let's communicate.

10545
05:03:14,010 --> 05:03:14,310
Okay.

10546
05:03:14,310 --> 05:03:14,610
Okay.

10547
05:03:14,970 --> 05:03:15,450
Communicate.

10548
05:03:16,430 --> 05:03:18,390
If you tell me go, I go.

10549
05:03:18,470 --> 05:03:20,690
If you tell me fall back, I'll back.

10550
05:03:21,030 --> 05:03:21,450
Yeah.

10551
05:03:22,650 --> 05:03:23,130
Okay.

10552
05:03:23,670 --> 05:03:24,150
Okay.

10553
05:03:24,350 --> 05:03:24,470
Okay.

10554
05:03:24,750 --> 05:03:25,230
Okay.

10555
05:03:25,230 --> 05:03:25,290
Okay.

10556
05:03:25,290 --> 05:03:25,450
Okay.

10557
05:03:25,730 --> 05:03:26,210
Oh.

10558
05:03:43,190 --> 05:03:44,510
I know why.

10559
05:03:44,650 --> 05:03:45,090
Okay.

10560
05:03:45,210 --> 05:03:45,570
I know.

10561
05:03:46,230 --> 05:03:47,670
Because I have 200 bing.

10562
05:03:47,730 --> 05:03:47,890
Okay.

10563
05:03:47,990 --> 05:03:49,110
I will play more safe.

10564
05:03:50,890 --> 05:03:51,910
More safe.

10565
05:03:56,670 --> 05:03:57,350
Ah.

10566
05:03:58,270 --> 05:03:58,950
Champion.

10567
05:04:02,370 --> 05:04:04,070
Basement until champion.

10568
05:04:07,640 --> 05:04:08,320
Champion.

10569
05:04:12,600 --> 05:04:13,280
Champon.

10570
05:04:13,280 --> 05:04:13,680
Champon this.

10571
05:04:13,880 --> 05:04:14,480
Champon this.

10572
05:04:15,680 --> 05:04:16,820
I haven't...

10573
05:04:16,820 --> 05:04:18,840
I haven't ate breakfast yet.

10574
05:04:19,000 --> 05:04:22,100
And it's 3pm now.

10575
05:04:22,240 --> 05:04:22,880
And it's 3pm now.

10576
05:04:23,880 --> 05:04:24,580
Me too.

10577
05:04:24,720 --> 05:04:25,100
Me too.

10578
05:04:25,340 --> 05:04:26,100
So fast.

10579
05:04:26,200 --> 05:04:26,960
So fast.

10580
05:04:27,560 --> 05:04:28,860
It's 3pm now.

10581
05:04:30,940 --> 05:04:31,780
5pm now.

10582
05:04:32,280 --> 05:04:32,800
Yo.

10583
05:04:33,920 --> 05:04:34,920
So... Yes.

10584
05:04:35,080 --> 05:04:35,240
Yes.

10585
05:04:35,340 --> 05:04:35,520
Yes.

10586
05:04:36,580 --> 05:04:37,100
Hungry.

10587
05:04:38,060 --> 05:04:38,580
No.

10588
05:04:38,660 --> 05:04:38,880
No.

10589
05:04:38,940 --> 05:04:39,200
No.

10590
05:04:39,520 --> 05:04:40,300
No eat.

10591
05:04:40,460 --> 05:04:40,520
Hungry.

10592
05:04:40,780 --> 05:04:41,700
No champion.

10593
05:04:41,820 --> 05:04:42,420
No food.

10594
05:04:46,550 --> 05:04:47,450
No sleep.

10595
05:04:48,470 --> 05:04:49,230
No sleep.

10596
05:04:49,610 --> 05:04:51,490
Why is the voice so small?

10597
05:04:51,750 --> 05:04:52,370
It's small, right?

10598
05:04:52,430 --> 05:04:53,150
It's so close.

10599
05:04:53,850 --> 05:04:54,530
Suddenly it's close.

10600
05:04:55,730 --> 05:04:56,030
Eh?

10601
05:04:56,610 --> 05:04:57,090
Yeah.

10602
05:04:57,930 --> 05:04:58,490
It's close.

10603
05:05:04,030 --> 05:05:04,510
Okay.

10604
05:05:04,550 --> 05:05:04,930
Okay.

10605
05:05:04,990 --> 05:05:05,430
Okay.

10606
05:05:05,430 --> 05:05:07,590
I will play Baton.

10607
05:05:10,090 --> 05:05:10,570
Okay.

10608
05:05:15,210 --> 05:05:16,050
See you.

10609
05:05:16,670 --> 05:05:17,150
Baton.

10610
05:05:17,470 --> 05:05:17,790
I'm back.

10611
05:05:18,030 --> 05:05:18,810
Who needs to eat?

10612
05:05:20,370 --> 05:05:20,850
Um.

10613
05:05:20,990 --> 05:05:22,210
There's no one needs to eat.

10614
05:05:22,450 --> 05:05:22,750
Good.

10615
05:05:30,330 --> 05:05:30,810
Oh.

10616
05:05:31,170 --> 05:05:31,650
Oh.

10617
05:05:31,650 --> 05:05:32,290
Only play.

10618
05:05:33,730 --> 05:05:35,190
Only winners eat.

10619
05:05:36,450 --> 05:05:38,430
Until we win the game.

10620
05:05:38,550 --> 05:05:38,730
Until we win the game.

10621
05:05:38,730 --> 05:05:38,730
Okay.

10622
05:05:39,310 --> 05:05:41,150
Only winners eat.

10623
05:05:41,550 --> 05:05:41,570
Yeah.

10624
05:05:41,650 --> 05:05:43,870
Uto Uto said that she was hungry.

10625
05:05:43,910 --> 05:05:45,490
But she didn't need to eat.

10626
05:05:45,710 --> 05:05:45,930
Oh.

10627
05:05:46,410 --> 05:05:47,650
Eat and play.

10628
05:05:49,010 --> 05:05:49,650
Yes.

10629
05:05:49,650 --> 05:05:49,950
Yes.

10630
05:05:49,970 --> 05:05:50,590
Eat and play.

10631
05:05:52,670 --> 05:05:54,270
That's why we have two hands.

10632
05:05:55,610 --> 05:05:56,570
Two hands.

10633
05:05:56,670 --> 05:05:57,210
Two hands.

10634
05:05:57,770 --> 05:05:59,650
Two hands.

10635
05:06:02,510 --> 05:06:04,470
Don't-don't you have two hands too?

10636
05:06:07,450 --> 05:06:07,770
Yeah.

10637
05:06:07,810 --> 05:06:08,930
But I'm not hungry.

10638
05:06:09,070 --> 05:06:09,390
I already ate.

10639
05:06:09,750 --> 05:06:10,750
I already ate.

10640
05:06:12,810 --> 05:06:17,310
I can't-I can't play until we got the champion.

10641
05:06:20,400 --> 05:06:21,040
Hello.

10642
05:06:21,100 --> 05:06:21,880
We got this.

10643
05:06:22,980 --> 05:06:23,620
Champion.

10644
05:06:27,020 --> 05:06:28,040
This is it.

10645
05:06:37,240 --> 05:06:38,020
This is it.

10646
05:06:39,460 --> 05:06:40,620
I believe!

10647
05:06:42,340 --> 05:06:44,740
We just need to find the perfect comp!

10648
05:06:45,060 --> 05:06:46,300
Just keep believing!

10649
05:06:48,260 --> 05:06:49,420
Just believe!

10650
05:06:53,040 --> 05:06:54,920
Just keep believing!

10651
05:06:56,260 --> 05:06:57,140
I believe.

10652
05:06:57,340 --> 05:06:58,460
I believe I can fly.

10653
05:06:59,780 --> 05:07:00,560
Me too.

10654
05:07:01,540 --> 05:07:03,520
But you can't fly because you are a bird.

10655
05:07:03,520 --> 05:07:04,680
Yeah, exactly.

10656
05:07:05,480 --> 05:07:06,460
I believe.

10657
05:07:06,880 --> 05:07:08,740
I don't even need to believe, I know it's a fact.

10658
05:07:09,720 --> 05:07:09,940
Okay.

10659
05:07:10,080 --> 05:07:10,940
Oh, okay.

10660
05:07:11,080 --> 05:07:11,580
You're right.

10661
05:07:12,960 --> 05:07:14,140
It's your turn.

10662
05:07:14,800 --> 05:07:15,720
Okay, okay, okay.

10663
05:07:15,780 --> 05:07:16,060
Go here!

10664
05:07:16,780 --> 05:07:18,860
This is our champion spot!

10665
05:07:19,140 --> 05:07:19,980
Our champion spot!

10666
05:07:20,080 --> 05:07:20,680
I agree!

10667
05:07:21,060 --> 05:07:21,740
I believe!

10668
05:07:23,520 --> 05:07:25,000
There's no one coming with us!

10669
05:07:25,020 --> 05:07:25,280
See?

10670
05:07:25,500 --> 05:07:26,400
Oh my god!

10671
05:07:26,420 --> 05:07:27,080
We are champions!

10672
05:07:27,920 --> 05:07:29,600
There's no one gonna steal our loot!

10673
05:07:31,180 --> 05:07:32,120
I hope so.

10674
05:07:33,520 --> 05:07:33,980
I'm double checking.

10675
05:07:34,220 --> 05:07:34,680
I'm scared.

10676
05:07:34,680 --> 05:07:35,240
No, no, no.

10677
05:07:35,240 --> 05:07:35,620
Let it go.

10678
05:07:35,880 --> 05:07:37,400
No, no, no.

10679
05:07:37,420 --> 05:07:38,280
Let it go.

10680
05:07:38,480 --> 05:07:39,520
Oh, thank god.

10681
05:07:39,620 --> 05:07:39,880
Okay.

10682
05:07:40,020 --> 05:07:42,020
I thought... I was scared you'll lie to me.

10683
05:07:43,300 --> 05:07:43,780
No.

10684
05:07:44,060 --> 05:07:46,300
I'm not... Oh my god.

10685
05:07:46,640 --> 05:07:47,620
I'm not lying.

10686
05:07:48,980 --> 05:07:49,760
Alright, here we go.

10687
05:07:50,060 --> 05:07:53,200
Oh yeah, remember when you said you heard people over here?

10688
05:07:53,400 --> 05:07:54,120
Remember that?

10689
05:07:54,340 --> 05:07:54,880
Do you remember?

10690
05:07:56,560 --> 05:07:57,180
That's sad.

10691
05:07:57,280 --> 05:07:58,620
Yeah, wasn't that a lie?

10692
05:08:00,520 --> 05:08:01,000
No!

10693
05:08:01,000 --> 05:08:01,720
That's true.

10694
05:08:03,520 --> 05:08:04,420
And where did the person go?

10695
05:08:05,840 --> 05:08:08,780
I think they left the game.

10696
05:08:08,920 --> 05:08:09,080
Yeah?

10697
05:08:09,080 --> 05:08:11,240
Oh, they left the game.

10698
05:08:14,920 --> 05:08:16,440
Where was his box?

10699
05:08:18,120 --> 05:08:22,200
Oh, maybe they're cheater and they were trying to kill you and they got banned.

10700
05:08:22,320 --> 05:08:23,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10701
05:08:23,940 --> 05:08:25,020
Where was the box?

10702
05:08:29,240 --> 05:08:30,980
Where was the box?

10703
05:08:31,940 --> 05:08:34,300
Because you couldn't find it.

10704
05:08:34,300 --> 05:08:35,220
The box is somewhere.

10705
05:08:35,220 --> 05:08:35,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10706
05:08:35,860 --> 05:08:37,220
I couldn't find it.

10707
05:08:37,280 --> 05:08:40,060
It just disappeared.

10708
05:08:41,180 --> 05:08:41,780
Yes.

10709
05:08:42,540 --> 05:08:44,020
Wow, so spooky.

10710
05:08:44,480 --> 05:08:45,960
I need a repeater.

10711
05:08:47,060 --> 05:08:47,660
Okay.

10712
05:08:50,640 --> 05:08:53,380
Okay, I got Nemesis and R9.

10713
05:08:53,460 --> 05:08:54,080
R9 again.

10714
05:08:54,440 --> 05:08:58,240
I have Hemlock and R9, but I want a repeater.

10715
05:08:58,340 --> 05:08:59,280
Nemesis here.

10716
05:09:00,980 --> 05:09:01,780
Okay, I'm good.

10717
05:09:02,640 --> 05:09:04,400
I need Hemlock.

10718
05:09:04,560 --> 05:09:05,060
Oh, not Hemlock.

10719
05:09:06,020 --> 05:09:06,640
R3030.

10720
05:09:09,040 --> 05:09:09,660
Okay.

10721
05:09:11,100 --> 05:09:11,940
Where am I?

10722
05:09:12,480 --> 05:09:13,940
Oh, I want that.

10723
05:09:15,940 --> 05:09:17,480
Oh, I did it.

10724
05:09:23,200 --> 05:09:25,400
I'm gonna grab the ball, actually.

10725
05:09:27,920 --> 05:09:28,540
Prowler?

10726
05:09:30,180 --> 05:09:30,960
Nice one.

10727
05:09:34,000 --> 05:09:36,180
Where is the 3030?

10728
05:09:38,220 --> 05:09:40,500
I'll ping you if I find it.

10729
05:09:41,460 --> 05:09:42,060
3030.

10730
05:09:42,880 --> 05:09:44,060
Does anyone need bats?

10731
05:09:44,180 --> 05:09:44,540
I have six.

10732
05:09:45,560 --> 05:09:46,520
I have two.

10733
05:09:46,900 --> 05:09:47,100
Okay.

10734
05:09:47,480 --> 05:09:48,800
Oops, that's not right.

10735
05:09:49,900 --> 05:09:50,940
I dropped two.

10736
05:09:51,200 --> 05:09:51,840
Ball bat.

10737
05:09:53,460 --> 05:09:54,060
Okay.

10738
05:09:54,360 --> 05:09:55,320
I got it.

10739
05:09:57,480 --> 05:09:58,680
If anyone...

10740
05:10:01,060 --> 05:10:03,700
I have... I want scope.

10741
05:10:04,200 --> 05:10:07,580
Oh, I have scope, but it's my scope.

10742
05:10:07,600 --> 05:10:07,860
Oh, Nemesis.

10743
05:10:09,080 --> 05:10:09,720
Okay.

10744
05:10:10,000 --> 05:10:12,020
If someone ping me...

10745
05:10:12,780 --> 05:10:14,980
I just wanted you to know.

10746
05:10:16,580 --> 05:10:17,220
Okay.

10747
05:10:20,860 --> 05:10:22,360
All right, Uto.

10748
05:10:23,040 --> 05:10:26,620
Uto, you're gonna kill 10 people, okay?

10749
05:10:27,180 --> 05:10:28,180
10 people?

10750
05:10:28,340 --> 05:10:29,240
10 people, yes.

10751
05:10:29,240 --> 05:10:29,560
Yes, yes.

10752
05:10:29,620 --> 05:10:32,360
You kill 10 people, and then we win champion.

10753
05:10:32,640 --> 05:10:33,040
Okay.

10754
05:10:33,040 --> 05:10:33,580
That's it.

10755
05:10:33,760 --> 05:10:35,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10756
05:10:35,200 --> 05:10:36,000
I believe in you.

10757
05:10:36,880 --> 05:10:38,700
If you don't kill 10 people...

10758
05:10:38,700 --> 05:10:38,740
Uh-oh.

10759
05:10:39,080 --> 05:10:40,260
I need mid-chain.

10760
05:10:40,420 --> 05:10:40,840
I need mid-chain.

10761
05:10:40,920 --> 05:10:41,220
I'll report you.

10762
05:10:42,720 --> 05:10:43,560
Okay, okay.

10763
05:10:45,840 --> 05:10:47,300
I'll report you for...

10764
05:10:47,300 --> 05:10:47,780
I'm 10 people killed.

10765
05:10:48,000 --> 05:10:49,180
...for creeping my game.

10766
05:10:51,840 --> 05:10:52,800
Oh my god.

10767
05:10:53,840 --> 05:10:56,040
You don't want me to report you.

10768
05:10:57,180 --> 05:10:57,640
I have six now.

10769
05:10:59,240 --> 05:11:00,400
There's more bats here.

10770
05:11:01,540 --> 05:11:02,280
A lot.

10771
05:11:02,740 --> 05:11:03,380
I don't need it.

10772
05:11:03,840 --> 05:11:04,840
I need to...

10773
05:11:04,840 --> 05:11:05,600
Hi.

10774
05:11:07,280 --> 05:11:09,220
Okay, each kill you get...

10775
05:11:10,120 --> 05:11:11,700
Uto, each kill...

10776
05:11:12,440 --> 05:11:13,440
you get...

10777
05:11:13,440 --> 05:11:14,860
you can eat one...

10778
05:11:14,860 --> 05:11:16,500
you can have one bite of food.

10779
05:11:19,240 --> 05:11:19,740
Really?

10780
05:11:20,420 --> 05:11:20,480
Yeah.

10781
05:11:20,760 --> 05:11:21,400
Like, yeah.

10782
05:11:21,780 --> 05:11:22,780
Oh my god.

10783
05:11:23,720 --> 05:11:25,140
What is this game?

10784
05:11:25,180 --> 05:11:25,620
What is this game?

10785
05:11:25,620 --> 05:11:26,220
It's like a...

10786
05:11:26,220 --> 05:11:26,940
like a dog.

10787
05:11:26,940 --> 05:11:29,040
Like, you know, you're training a dog.

10788
05:11:29,780 --> 05:11:31,460
No, don't kill me.

10789
05:11:31,460 --> 05:11:32,760
This game is like a dog.

10790
05:11:33,040 --> 05:11:33,860
I'm a dog.

10791
05:11:34,020 --> 05:11:34,620
Oh my god.

10792
05:11:34,860 --> 05:11:35,820
I'm a dog.

10793
05:11:36,140 --> 05:11:37,900
How does it change a painting?

10794
05:11:39,140 --> 05:11:39,900
Just make...

10795
05:11:40,580 --> 05:11:42,160
Just make a paint and it's...

10796
05:11:42,160 --> 05:11:42,420
Sorry.

10797
05:11:42,620 --> 05:11:42,920
I'm sorry.

10798
05:11:43,080 --> 05:11:43,340
What?

10799
05:11:43,420 --> 05:11:44,640
Don't you have dog ears?

10800
05:11:47,060 --> 05:11:48,520
One kill, one bite.

10801
05:11:48,660 --> 05:11:49,560
Oh my god.

10802
05:11:50,660 --> 05:11:51,680
Here's a scope.

10803
05:11:52,260 --> 05:11:54,220
It's called positive reinforcement.

10804
05:11:55,560 --> 05:11:56,160
It's...

10805
05:11:58,040 --> 05:11:59,720
I'm rewarding her.

10806
05:11:59,800 --> 05:12:00,760
She gets to eat.

10807
05:12:01,180 --> 05:12:01,480
What?

10808
05:12:02,440 --> 05:12:03,040
What?

10809
05:12:03,520 --> 05:12:04,120
Enemy?

10810
05:12:04,340 --> 05:12:04,740
Enemy?

10811
05:12:04,740 --> 05:12:05,460
What happened?

10812
05:12:05,620 --> 05:12:06,340
What happened?

10813
05:12:06,680 --> 05:12:07,460
What was that?

10814
05:12:07,720 --> 05:12:09,480
I heard a slide.

10815
05:12:10,080 --> 05:12:10,360
In here?

10816
05:12:10,740 --> 05:12:11,020
No.

10817
05:12:11,060 --> 05:12:11,640
Yeah.

10818
05:12:13,740 --> 05:12:14,200
Enemy, enemy, enemy.

10819
05:12:14,400 --> 05:12:14,940
Yeah.

10820
05:12:15,360 --> 05:12:17,760
Okay, okay.

10821
05:12:19,040 --> 05:12:19,900
I'm pushing.

10822
05:12:21,800 --> 05:12:22,600
Okay, okay.

10823
05:12:22,640 --> 05:12:23,780
I'm right behind you.

10824
05:12:25,440 --> 05:12:26,640
Uto, go.

10825
05:12:26,640 --> 05:12:27,260
Uto, go.

10826
05:12:27,480 --> 05:12:27,700
Uto, go.

10827
05:12:27,720 --> 05:12:28,000
Go.

10828
05:12:28,140 --> 05:12:28,560
Go.

10829
05:12:28,680 --> 05:12:29,120
Okay, okay.

10830
05:12:29,200 --> 05:12:29,760
Go, go.

10831
05:12:41,940 --> 05:12:43,120
Wait, where did you...

10832
05:12:44,200 --> 05:12:44,880
I'm here.

10833
05:12:45,060 --> 05:12:45,160
I'm here.

10834
05:12:45,160 --> 05:12:45,280
I'm here.

10835
05:12:45,400 --> 05:12:45,660
I'm here.

10836
05:12:46,020 --> 05:12:46,500
Okay.

10837
05:12:48,280 --> 05:12:48,760
Inside?

10838
05:12:50,440 --> 05:12:50,920
Scan?

10839
05:12:51,260 --> 05:12:51,560
No.

10840
05:12:52,340 --> 05:12:53,880
Where the fuck did they go?

10841
05:12:56,640 --> 05:12:57,400
I heard...

10842
05:12:57,400 --> 05:12:58,200
I heard something.

10843
05:12:58,540 --> 05:12:59,080
I heard something.

10844
05:12:59,240 --> 05:12:59,580
I'm here.

10845
05:13:00,680 --> 05:13:01,160
Okay.

10846
05:13:01,240 --> 05:13:02,720
Remember last time you heard something?

10847
05:13:05,140 --> 05:13:06,560
I heard something.

10848
05:13:07,060 --> 05:13:07,420
Okay.

10849
05:13:07,440 --> 05:13:07,820
Okay.

10850
05:13:07,840 --> 05:13:08,080
Okay.

10851
05:13:08,400 --> 05:13:08,700
The scan!

10852
05:13:09,800 --> 05:13:10,520
The scan!

10853
05:13:13,460 --> 05:13:14,740
Yeah, you heard something.

10854
05:13:15,640 --> 05:13:15,700
I love this song!

10855
05:13:17,480 --> 05:13:18,660
There's people here.

10856
05:13:20,160 --> 05:13:20,620
Where's Flandre?

10857
05:13:20,620 --> 05:13:21,060
Where's Flandre?

10858
05:13:21,560 --> 05:13:23,380
Oh, in front of me, in front of me, in front of me.

10859
05:13:23,520 --> 05:13:24,300
Go, go, go, go.

10860
05:13:24,660 --> 05:13:25,020
Wow!

10861
05:13:25,740 --> 05:13:26,100
Wow!

10862
05:13:27,800 --> 05:13:28,500
Here in front.

10863
05:13:28,900 --> 05:13:30,140
Two teams, two teams, two teams.

10864
05:13:32,300 --> 05:13:33,120
Where am I?

10865
05:13:33,240 --> 05:13:35,620
The fuck is going on?

10866
05:13:38,400 --> 05:13:40,300
Two, two, one, two, two, one, one.

10867
05:13:40,360 --> 05:13:41,080
Okay, one!

10868
05:13:42,120 --> 05:13:42,400
Yeah.

10869
05:13:45,540 --> 05:13:46,940
Are they fighting each other?

10870
05:13:47,420 --> 05:13:49,420
Here they are.

10871
05:13:49,620 --> 05:13:51,340
There's like a team in that building.

10872
05:13:51,840 --> 05:13:53,060
Okay, I will scan.

10873
05:13:53,600 --> 05:13:54,140
Okay.

10874
05:13:56,860 --> 05:13:57,400
One.

10875
05:13:59,740 --> 05:14:00,280
Why?

10876
05:14:01,060 --> 05:14:02,700
They move so fast.

10877
05:14:03,960 --> 05:14:04,880
Oh, wait, here.

10878
05:14:05,140 --> 05:14:05,640
Wow!

10879
05:14:05,960 --> 05:14:07,380
That's a different team.

10880
05:14:08,480 --> 05:14:11,100
I'm still like holding on to like...

10881
05:14:11,100 --> 05:14:11,200
I'm not a good team.

10882
05:14:12,520 --> 05:14:12,960
Yeah.

10883
05:14:17,160 --> 05:14:18,940
I remember when you heard something, Ditto.

10884
05:14:22,420 --> 05:14:23,660
Over there, over there, over there.

10885
05:14:24,080 --> 05:14:24,720
Holyo, Holyo.

10886
05:14:25,260 --> 05:14:25,700
Yeah.

10887
05:14:27,700 --> 05:14:28,300
Helping you.

10888
05:14:29,200 --> 05:14:30,880
High ground, they're high ground now.

10889
05:14:31,100 --> 05:14:31,880
I'm gonna come to you.

10890
05:14:32,620 --> 05:14:33,540
There's people in front.

10891
05:14:33,660 --> 05:14:34,240
There's people here.

10892
05:14:35,860 --> 05:14:36,840
Okay, I'm gonna scan.

10893
05:14:37,120 --> 05:14:37,840
Next building.

10894
05:14:38,100 --> 05:14:39,380
No one in next building.

10895
05:14:39,960 --> 05:14:40,320
I'm tracking tracks.

10896
05:14:40,480 --> 05:14:41,760
I see people in train.

10897
05:14:42,980 --> 05:14:44,040
Not train, uh...

10898
05:14:44,040 --> 05:14:44,320
Steamer.

10899
05:14:44,520 --> 05:14:45,220
Steamer building.

10900
05:14:47,280 --> 05:14:47,760
Okay.

10901
05:14:48,120 --> 05:14:48,860
Steamer building.

10902
05:14:51,420 --> 05:14:51,900
Whoa!

10903
05:14:53,680 --> 05:14:55,260
What the fuck is wrong with you?

10904
05:14:57,300 --> 05:14:58,520
What the fuck?

10905
05:14:58,620 --> 05:14:59,160
What the fuck?

10906
05:14:59,400 --> 05:15:01,560
Yeah, he fucked me up.

10907
05:15:03,080 --> 05:15:03,560
Oh.

10908
05:15:05,460 --> 05:15:06,820
Alright, I need heal.

10909
05:15:06,940 --> 05:15:07,680
Is that Sniper?

10910
05:15:07,960 --> 05:15:08,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10911
05:15:09,960 --> 05:15:11,560
Sniper and 30-30.

10912
05:15:16,060 --> 05:15:16,840
They're not...

10913
05:15:16,840 --> 05:15:17,480
They're not...

10914
05:15:18,140 --> 05:15:21,000
This team really wants to kill me.

10915
05:15:22,000 --> 05:15:23,260
I'm going over to you guys.

10916
05:15:23,540 --> 05:15:24,240
Behind, behind.

10917
05:15:24,480 --> 05:15:25,300
Okay, okay.

10918
05:15:25,520 --> 05:15:27,160
I'm going to you, Ditto.

10919
05:15:27,840 --> 05:15:28,340
Okay.

10920
05:15:28,480 --> 05:15:29,000
I'm good, I'm good.

10921
05:15:36,100 --> 05:15:36,980
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

10922
05:15:37,480 --> 05:15:39,560
Behind the two teams.

10923
05:15:40,700 --> 05:15:43,220
I want to fight with my aim.

10924
05:15:44,160 --> 05:15:44,660
20...

10925
05:15:44,720 --> 05:15:46,200
There's like a...

10926
05:15:47,960 --> 05:15:49,580
They're like all so far.

10927
05:15:49,680 --> 05:15:50,120
They're so far.

10928
05:15:50,920 --> 05:15:51,520
Yeah.

10929
05:15:54,780 --> 05:15:56,640
Everybody's just running away from each other.

10930
05:15:58,520 --> 05:16:00,280
So we can't really do anything.

10931
05:16:00,940 --> 05:16:01,420
Yeah.

10932
05:16:02,540 --> 05:16:03,640
They keep running.

10933
05:16:04,280 --> 05:16:05,740
They're all so scared.

10934
05:16:09,490 --> 05:16:10,470
Come on!

10935
05:16:10,950 --> 05:16:12,810
Which one needs to eat?

10936
05:16:14,570 --> 05:16:16,170
Which one needs to eat?

10937
05:16:16,170 --> 05:16:16,410
I'm going to kill!

10938
05:16:17,130 --> 05:16:18,090
Hungry, hungry.

10939
05:16:22,090 --> 05:16:22,570
Okay.

10940
05:16:24,810 --> 05:16:25,770
There is...

10941
05:16:25,770 --> 05:16:27,750
They're all just poking each other.

10942
05:16:27,810 --> 05:16:28,730
They're not fighting at all.

10943
05:16:28,810 --> 05:16:29,250
Wait, wait.

10944
05:16:29,510 --> 05:16:33,630
Yeah, they're fighting here too.

10945
05:16:33,710 --> 05:16:34,190
They're fighting here.

10946
05:16:35,150 --> 05:16:35,630
Okay.

10947
05:16:37,890 --> 05:16:38,370
What?

10948
05:16:39,010 --> 05:16:39,650
Pushing up.

10949
05:16:40,930 --> 05:16:41,930
I'm using my ult.

10950
05:16:42,370 --> 05:16:43,730
They're really far, Ditto.

10951
05:16:47,650 --> 05:16:48,010
Okay.

10952
05:16:48,010 --> 05:16:48,810
I went there, I went there.

10953
05:16:48,810 --> 05:16:49,330
I'm so far.

10954
05:16:49,670 --> 05:16:55,430
I'm using my ult.

10955
05:16:56,770 --> 05:16:57,130
I'm using my ult.

10956
05:16:57,150 --> 05:16:57,510
I'm using my ult.

10957
05:16:57,510 --> 05:16:58,190
They're so long.

10958
05:16:59,610 --> 05:17:00,490
Kind of long.

10959
05:17:02,630 --> 05:17:04,030
I'm going to go get anchor.

10960
05:17:05,330 --> 05:17:05,690
I'm going to go get anchor.

10961
05:17:05,690 --> 05:17:05,970
Here, here.

10962
05:17:06,050 --> 05:17:06,690
In front of me.

10963
05:17:06,710 --> 05:17:08,530
I thirsted, I thirsted.

10964
05:17:08,610 --> 05:17:09,070
Okay, Ditto.

10965
05:17:09,150 --> 05:17:09,570
You're by yourself.

10966
05:17:10,470 --> 05:17:11,550
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

10967
05:17:11,730 --> 05:17:11,790
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

10968
05:17:13,730 --> 05:17:14,190
I'm here, I'm here.

10969
05:17:14,590 --> 05:17:15,150
Got you.

10970
05:17:16,010 --> 05:17:16,450
Nice.

10971
05:17:20,020 --> 05:17:20,880
I got the bat.

10972
05:17:21,220 --> 05:17:22,200
I thirsted for you.

10973
05:17:23,580 --> 05:17:25,380
There's another team behind me.

10974
05:17:25,580 --> 05:17:26,100
They are?

10975
05:17:26,740 --> 05:17:27,180
Where?

10976
05:17:27,540 --> 05:17:28,820
I see them, I see them.

10977
05:17:29,920 --> 05:17:30,660
Careful, careful.

10978
05:17:31,520 --> 05:17:32,180
One is K.

10979
05:17:33,520 --> 05:17:34,120
See her?

10980
05:17:34,640 --> 05:17:35,360
Oh my god.

10981
05:17:35,760 --> 05:17:36,640
Wait, behind me.

10982
05:17:37,140 --> 05:17:37,880
See her, 100.

10983
05:17:40,040 --> 05:17:40,920
Oh, sorry.

10984
05:17:41,980 --> 05:17:43,160
Got one, I got one.

10985
05:17:43,380 --> 05:17:44,280
Oh, fuck.

10986
05:17:44,320 --> 05:17:44,560
Okay.

10987
05:17:44,600 --> 05:17:45,140
Can you come talk to me?

10988
05:17:46,880 --> 05:17:47,640
I got the bat.

10989
05:17:47,640 --> 05:17:48,200
I got to you, I got to you.

10990
05:17:50,140 --> 05:17:51,800
Maybe he's batting.

10991
05:17:51,900 --> 05:17:53,320
He's batting.

10992
05:17:54,580 --> 05:17:54,940
Okay.

10993
05:17:56,560 --> 05:17:57,280
Oh no.

10994
05:17:57,420 --> 05:17:57,820
I got scanned.

10995
05:17:59,400 --> 05:18:00,120
Another team.

10996
05:18:06,520 --> 05:18:06,880
Fuck.

10997
05:18:07,060 --> 05:18:07,700
Oh shit.

10998
05:18:10,140 --> 05:18:10,720
Okay, here, here.

10999
05:18:11,040 --> 05:18:12,120
Yeah, but there he is.

11000
05:18:12,280 --> 05:18:12,620
Okay, okay.

11001
05:18:13,020 --> 05:18:13,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11002
05:18:14,660 --> 05:18:15,520
Where is she?

11003
05:18:17,180 --> 05:18:18,280
Oh my god.

11004
05:18:18,480 --> 05:18:19,860
You might have a bullet.

11005
05:18:29,360 --> 05:18:30,980
Oh my god.

11006
05:18:33,000 --> 05:18:34,580
Wait, it's two teams.

11007
05:18:34,660 --> 05:18:35,740
And they shot at me.

11008
05:18:36,260 --> 05:18:37,920
It was two teams.

11009
05:18:38,280 --> 05:18:40,240
They both shot at me.

11010
05:18:41,700 --> 05:18:43,060
Oh my god.

11011
05:18:43,380 --> 05:18:43,920
Okay, Uto.

11012
05:18:44,020 --> 05:18:45,380
How many kills did you get, Uto?

11013
05:18:46,880 --> 05:18:47,420
Okay.

11014
05:18:47,540 --> 05:18:49,180
How many kills, Uto, did you get?

11015
05:18:50,460 --> 05:18:51,520
How many kills?

11016
05:18:51,640 --> 05:18:52,120
Zero, zero.

11017
05:18:52,840 --> 05:18:53,700
No bite.

11018
05:18:53,980 --> 05:18:54,680
No bite.

11019
05:18:55,000 --> 05:18:55,560
No bite.

11020
05:18:55,800 --> 05:18:56,760
No bite.

11021
05:19:01,030 --> 05:19:02,470
How many kills did I get?

11022
05:19:02,570 --> 05:19:04,010
Oh, I got zero too, so...

11023
05:19:04,010 --> 05:19:04,790
I'm...

11024
05:19:07,150 --> 05:19:09,090
Only Ditto can eat.

11025
05:19:10,270 --> 05:19:10,650
Why?

11026
05:19:10,970 --> 05:19:11,530
Why?

11027
05:19:11,670 --> 05:19:12,850
Wait, did you get one kill?

11028
05:19:14,290 --> 05:19:16,370
I get... I get one knock.

11029
05:19:16,550 --> 05:19:18,050
Oh, one knock, no bite.

11030
05:19:18,110 --> 05:19:19,070
I get one kill.

11031
05:19:19,110 --> 05:19:21,470
You can have one bite.

11032
05:19:21,810 --> 05:19:23,290
One bite.

11033
05:19:25,170 --> 05:19:27,790
Can I stack my bite?

11034
05:19:27,790 --> 05:19:28,590
Yeah, yeah.

11035
05:19:28,590 --> 05:19:29,310
No, no, no.

11036
05:19:29,550 --> 05:19:30,690
No, no, no.

11037
05:19:30,690 --> 05:19:31,230
No stacking.

11038
05:19:31,510 --> 05:19:32,390
No stacking.

11039
05:19:36,070 --> 05:19:37,750
It's... It's training.

11040
05:19:38,090 --> 05:19:39,210
We're all training.

11041
05:19:45,490 --> 05:19:46,890
We're here to train.

11042
05:19:47,950 --> 05:19:49,130
Oh my god.

11043
05:19:49,250 --> 05:19:50,470
What a chain.

11044
05:19:50,590 --> 05:19:51,270
What chain?

11045
05:19:52,550 --> 05:19:53,530
What chain?

11046
05:19:53,710 --> 05:19:54,350
Champion.

11047
05:19:54,410 --> 05:19:55,850
We're training for champion.

11048
05:19:56,450 --> 05:19:57,530
Oh, I see.

11049
05:19:57,790 --> 05:19:58,150
Yeah.

11050
05:19:59,050 --> 05:20:00,830
I almost forgot.

11051
05:20:00,950 --> 05:20:01,750
You almost forgot?

11052
05:20:01,870 --> 05:20:03,770
That's the reason why we haven't stopped.

11053
05:20:04,390 --> 05:20:05,310
What do you mean?

11054
05:20:08,190 --> 05:20:09,870
I have to...

11055
05:20:09,870 --> 05:20:11,590
order some food first.

11056
05:20:12,470 --> 05:20:13,650
We can do this.

11057
05:20:14,270 --> 05:20:14,850
Okay.

11058
05:20:15,110 --> 05:20:17,070
What are you gonna eat, Uta?

11059
05:20:18,290 --> 05:20:18,830
Hm?

11060
05:20:19,010 --> 05:20:20,490
What are you gonna eat?

11061
05:20:23,530 --> 05:20:24,170
Gohan.

11062
05:20:24,510 --> 05:20:24,830
Kills.

11063
05:20:25,490 --> 05:20:26,530
She's gonna eat kills.

11064
05:20:26,650 --> 05:20:26,910
Gohan?

11065
05:20:27,810 --> 05:20:28,290
Okay.

11066
05:20:28,690 --> 05:20:30,470
Yeah, I'm landing here.

11067
05:20:30,530 --> 05:20:31,050
Do we have team?

11068
05:20:31,170 --> 05:20:32,390
Oh, we have team.

11069
05:20:32,870 --> 05:20:34,110
Yeah, we have team.

11070
05:20:34,190 --> 05:20:34,530
That's Mirage.

11071
05:20:34,650 --> 05:20:35,250
That's Mirage.

11072
05:20:35,310 --> 05:20:36,030
That's stupid.

11073
05:20:36,350 --> 05:20:37,350
That is all fake.

11074
05:20:37,810 --> 05:20:40,830
But I hear... I hear people.

11075
05:20:41,750 --> 05:20:42,530
Oh no, no.

11076
05:20:42,630 --> 05:20:43,450
It's still Mirage.

11077
05:20:43,590 --> 05:20:43,910
Yes.

11078
05:20:45,650 --> 05:20:47,410
Did you say that's stupid?

11079
05:20:47,670 --> 05:20:48,370
Who said that?

11080
05:20:54,250 --> 05:20:55,430
Yeah, that's stupid.

11081
05:20:55,430 --> 05:20:55,750
Stupid.

11082
05:20:57,710 --> 05:20:58,470
There's a lot of people.

11083
05:20:59,050 --> 05:20:59,450
There's a lot of people.

11084
05:20:59,490 --> 05:20:59,930
There's a lot of people.

11085
05:21:04,990 --> 05:21:05,630
I'm scared.

11086
05:21:05,830 --> 05:21:06,010
I'm scared.

11087
05:21:06,310 --> 05:21:06,770
I got the gap.

11088
05:21:09,970 --> 05:21:10,290
Wow!

11089
05:21:14,930 --> 05:21:15,250
Hello.

11090
05:21:15,510 --> 05:21:16,030
Are you okay?

11091
05:21:16,550 --> 05:21:16,870
Yeah.

11092
05:21:18,970 --> 05:21:19,430
We're fine.

11093
05:21:19,510 --> 05:21:19,810
We're fine.

11094
05:21:19,850 --> 05:21:20,870
We're so healthy.

11095
05:21:20,990 --> 05:21:21,730
This is two teams.

11096
05:21:22,410 --> 05:21:23,050
Two teams?

11097
05:21:23,310 --> 05:21:23,830
Two, two, two.

11098
05:21:24,410 --> 05:21:25,530
I have a sentinel.

11099
05:21:28,570 --> 05:21:29,030
Okay.

11100
05:21:30,570 --> 05:21:31,390
What the fuck?

11101
05:21:31,570 --> 05:21:32,710
I'm good.

11102
05:21:35,430 --> 05:21:35,890
Okay.

11103
05:21:35,910 --> 05:21:36,270
I'm good.

11104
05:21:38,450 --> 05:21:39,410
Do you have light?

11105
05:21:41,490 --> 05:21:42,510
Oh, I hear them.

11106
05:21:42,970 --> 05:21:44,310
They're still fighting.

11107
05:21:46,090 --> 05:21:46,550
Okay.

11108
05:21:47,510 --> 05:21:48,410
Wow, wow, wow.

11109
05:21:49,690 --> 05:21:50,150
Oh.

11110
05:21:50,270 --> 05:21:50,970
I got scanned?

11111
05:21:54,350 --> 05:21:55,390
Oh, knock, knock.

11112
05:21:55,570 --> 05:21:56,150
I hear knocks.

11113
05:21:56,210 --> 05:21:56,390
Hmm.

11114
05:21:58,110 --> 05:21:58,510
Nice.

11115
05:22:00,910 --> 05:22:01,650
Above us?

11116
05:22:01,850 --> 05:22:02,190
Yeah.

11117
05:22:04,270 --> 05:22:04,950
I'm gonna heal.

11118
05:22:06,030 --> 05:22:06,430
Okay.

11119
05:22:06,490 --> 05:22:06,970
Where are you?

11120
05:22:07,010 --> 05:22:07,350
Where are you?

11121
05:22:08,770 --> 05:22:09,570
I am here.

11122
05:22:11,350 --> 05:22:11,750
Hmm.

11123
05:22:13,670 --> 05:22:14,470
Oh, shit.

11124
05:22:14,710 --> 05:22:15,190
Oh, shit.

11125
05:22:16,450 --> 05:22:17,110
Where are you?

11126
05:22:18,110 --> 05:22:19,430
They're shooting her from high ground.

11127
05:22:20,170 --> 05:22:20,570
Okay.

11128
05:22:23,870 --> 05:22:24,910
They're still fighting.

11129
05:22:25,070 --> 05:22:25,810
I'm gonna wait a bit.

11130
05:22:28,870 --> 05:22:29,670
They're still fighting.

11131
05:22:29,670 --> 05:22:29,670
I'm gonna wait a bit.

11132
05:22:29,670 --> 05:22:29,670
They're still fighting.

11133
05:22:29,670 --> 05:22:29,830
I'm gonna wait a bit.

11134
05:22:29,830 --> 05:22:30,290
I got scanned.

11135
05:22:33,010 --> 05:22:33,410
Okay.

11136
05:22:33,410 --> 05:22:33,690
Push.

11137
05:22:35,590 --> 05:22:36,370
I cracked one.

11138
05:22:36,830 --> 05:22:37,510
Cracked bloodhound.

11139
05:22:37,590 --> 05:22:38,010
Cracked bloodhound.

11140
05:22:38,430 --> 05:22:39,050
Careful, careful.

11141
05:22:39,150 --> 05:22:39,590
The other...

11142
05:22:40,190 --> 05:22:41,550
The condom might drop on you.

11143
05:22:43,250 --> 05:22:43,990
Where's Bloodhound?

11144
05:22:44,250 --> 05:22:44,590
I don't know.

11145
05:22:44,670 --> 05:22:45,990
I didn't... I don't know where he ran to.

11146
05:22:46,530 --> 05:22:46,930
Oh.

11147
05:22:48,290 --> 05:22:49,010
Oh my god.

11148
05:22:49,130 --> 05:22:49,470
It's...

11149
05:22:49,470 --> 05:22:50,430
Oh my god.

11150
05:22:50,450 --> 05:22:51,170
It fucked up everything.

11151
05:22:51,170 --> 05:22:51,470
I'm getting...

11152
05:22:52,730 --> 05:22:53,450
I thirsted.

11153
05:22:54,410 --> 05:22:54,770
Okay.

11154
05:22:54,850 --> 05:22:55,310
I got thirst.

11155
05:22:55,490 --> 05:22:55,770
I got thirst.

11156
05:22:56,610 --> 05:22:56,970
Okay.

11157
05:22:56,970 --> 05:22:57,590
One down.

11158
05:22:57,590 --> 05:22:57,670
One down.

11159
05:22:57,670 --> 05:22:58,050
Drop to me.

11160
05:22:58,150 --> 05:22:58,410
Drop to me.

11161
05:22:59,030 --> 05:22:59,390
Careful.

11162
05:22:59,990 --> 05:23:00,650
One down.

11163
05:23:01,790 --> 05:23:02,510
I can...

11164
05:23:02,510 --> 05:23:03,330
What the fuck?

11165
05:23:07,590 --> 05:23:08,310
What the...

11166
05:23:10,050 --> 05:23:10,690
I thirsted.

11167
05:23:10,830 --> 05:23:11,990
One bike.

11168
05:23:12,030 --> 05:23:12,590
One bike.

11169
05:23:13,570 --> 05:23:13,930
Okay.

11170
05:23:15,430 --> 05:23:15,650
Okay.

11171
05:23:16,010 --> 05:23:16,630
Cover me.

11172
05:23:16,690 --> 05:23:16,990
Cover me.

11173
05:23:16,990 --> 05:23:17,290
Cover me.

11174
05:23:17,430 --> 05:23:17,790
Okay.

11175
05:23:17,870 --> 05:23:18,010
Okay.

11176
05:23:18,050 --> 05:23:18,230
Okay.

11177
05:23:19,170 --> 05:23:19,570
Where's...

11178
05:23:20,390 --> 05:23:21,150
Where's the cover?

11179
05:23:21,250 --> 05:23:21,950
Where's the cover?

11180
05:23:22,090 --> 05:23:22,210
Oh.

11181
05:23:22,390 --> 05:23:22,750
Oh.

11182
05:23:26,610 --> 05:23:29,930
Did I not say cover?

11183
05:23:31,490 --> 05:23:31,890
Yeah.

11184
05:23:31,890 --> 05:23:32,590
Cover me.

11185
05:23:35,010 --> 05:23:37,050
I don't know where they are.

11186
05:23:37,170 --> 05:23:37,830
Where are they?

11187
05:23:37,910 --> 05:23:38,730
I don't know.

11188
05:23:39,650 --> 05:23:40,490
I hear two.

11189
05:23:40,610 --> 05:23:40,910
It's two.

11190
05:23:40,950 --> 05:23:41,170
It's two.

11191
05:23:41,170 --> 05:23:41,350
It's two.

11192
05:23:42,350 --> 05:23:42,890
Through here.

11193
05:23:44,970 --> 05:23:45,370
Running.

11194
05:23:45,370 --> 05:23:45,770
Running.

11195
05:23:45,830 --> 05:23:46,010
Yeah.

11196
05:23:46,010 --> 05:23:46,190
Yeah.

11197
05:23:46,190 --> 05:23:46,310
Yeah.

11198
05:23:46,390 --> 05:23:46,550
Running.

11199
05:23:46,550 --> 05:23:46,550
Yeah.

11200
05:23:46,550 --> 05:23:46,550
Yeah.

11201
05:23:46,550 --> 05:23:46,550
Yeah.

11202
05:23:47,670 --> 05:23:48,890
I'm gonna go, Rez.

11203
05:23:51,050 --> 05:23:52,090
I don't know!

11204
05:23:52,150 --> 05:23:52,190
I don't know!

11205
05:23:52,190 --> 05:23:52,750
You get one bite!

11206
05:23:53,710 --> 05:23:54,970
You get one bite!

11207
05:23:55,310 --> 05:23:58,030
I also have one bite.

11208
05:23:58,290 --> 05:23:58,950
Oh my god!

11209
05:23:59,270 --> 05:23:59,690
I'm hungry!

11210
05:23:59,990 --> 05:24:01,410
You can have one bite!

11211
05:24:02,310 --> 05:24:04,410
One bite of whatever food you want.

11212
05:24:06,790 --> 05:24:07,890
One bite.

11213
05:24:08,290 --> 05:24:09,350
One bite.

11214
05:24:09,350 --> 05:24:09,590
I'm hungry!

11215
05:24:14,150 --> 05:24:17,270
Okay, but that grapple was funny.

11216
05:24:17,790 --> 05:24:22,410
I fucked my Gabo two times.

11217
05:24:22,530 --> 05:24:24,510
And the same place.

11218
05:24:28,490 --> 05:24:32,030
I don't know where he ran to.

11219
05:24:32,230 --> 05:24:33,530
He ulted and disappeared.

11220
05:24:34,470 --> 05:24:35,910
Wherever he is.

11221
05:24:36,250 --> 05:24:38,210
I think they're gonna go...

11222
05:24:39,350 --> 05:24:40,870
Yeah, I think so too.

11223
05:24:41,490 --> 05:24:42,830
We can loot then.

11224
05:24:43,650 --> 05:24:44,470
Oh yeah!

11225
05:24:45,050 --> 05:24:45,730
We won!

11226
05:24:46,530 --> 05:24:47,210
Okay.

11227
05:24:48,130 --> 05:24:49,650
I got it.

11228
05:24:50,610 --> 05:24:51,290
Okay.

11229
05:24:57,080 --> 05:24:58,300
We did it!

11230
05:24:58,700 --> 05:24:59,120
Yay!

11231
05:25:00,320 --> 05:25:01,740
I'm gonna run double heavy.

11232
05:25:03,140 --> 05:25:03,820
Nice!

11233
05:25:05,200 --> 05:25:06,800
I will just Hemlock and Root.

11234
05:25:07,040 --> 05:25:09,040
Yeah, I'm using Hemlock Prowler.

11235
05:25:11,480 --> 05:25:12,060
How far?

11236
05:25:12,200 --> 05:25:12,840
Oh, it's not that far.

11237
05:25:12,980 --> 05:25:13,380
The zone.

11238
05:25:13,660 --> 05:25:14,720
It's not that far yet.

11239
05:25:14,920 --> 05:25:15,380
Yeah, yeah.

11240
05:25:15,620 --> 05:25:18,700
Let me find repeater.

11241
05:25:19,000 --> 05:25:20,300
Oh, they're reviving!

11242
05:25:20,340 --> 05:25:21,640
They are?

11243
05:25:23,340 --> 05:25:24,220
I'm too lazy.

11244
05:25:24,600 --> 05:25:25,380
They can live.

11245
05:25:26,100 --> 05:25:26,480
Let's go.

11246
05:25:28,680 --> 05:25:29,200
Yay!

11247
05:25:33,540 --> 05:25:34,060
Yay!

11248
05:25:35,260 --> 05:25:36,820
Oh, this is looted.

11249
05:25:38,960 --> 05:25:39,780
Just looted.

11250
05:25:41,480 --> 05:25:42,120
Um, the armor.

11251
05:25:42,520 --> 05:25:45,940
Oh yeah, it's just the white armor.

11252
05:25:48,160 --> 05:25:50,080
So, I'm trying to find a 30.

11253
05:25:50,820 --> 05:25:51,260
Yay!

11254
05:25:51,540 --> 05:25:52,040
Oh, thank you.

11255
05:25:54,260 --> 05:25:55,120
You guys need bats?

11256
05:25:58,690 --> 05:25:59,550
You guys need bats?

11257
05:25:59,670 --> 05:26:00,470
I have four.

11258
05:26:00,770 --> 05:26:01,210
I have two.

11259
05:26:01,630 --> 05:26:02,850
Look at how many...

11260
05:26:02,850 --> 05:26:03,250
Oh, here.

11261
05:26:03,370 --> 05:26:03,970
I'll give one.

11262
05:26:05,430 --> 05:26:06,090
Thank you.

11263
05:26:08,390 --> 05:26:09,330
I'm gonna go...

11264
05:26:10,890 --> 05:26:12,270
I'm gonna open this crate.

11265
05:26:12,870 --> 05:26:13,310
I'm gonna open this crate.

11266
05:26:13,330 --> 05:26:14,290
Okay.

11267
05:26:18,740 --> 05:26:19,260
Oh.

11268
05:26:19,340 --> 05:26:20,120
More bats.

11269
05:26:21,600 --> 05:26:22,300
Mm-hmm.

11270
05:26:22,480 --> 05:26:24,100
Yeah, yeah.

11271
05:26:24,140 --> 05:26:24,980
There's two extra here.

11272
05:26:26,680 --> 05:26:27,200
And...

11273
05:26:27,200 --> 05:26:28,120
Two back two.

11274
05:26:30,020 --> 05:26:30,720
I have...

11275
05:26:30,720 --> 05:26:31,240
I need a scope.

11276
05:26:31,720 --> 05:26:34,960
Um, which scope?

11277
05:26:35,800 --> 05:26:36,320
Uh...

11278
05:26:36,320 --> 05:26:37,700
Two, three, or four.

11279
05:26:38,380 --> 05:26:39,460
Oh my god!

11280
05:26:39,480 --> 05:26:39,880
Hammer point!

11281
05:26:42,260 --> 05:26:43,220
I'm gonna grab it.

11282
05:26:44,840 --> 05:26:45,560
Light mag.

11283
05:26:45,660 --> 05:26:46,100
Light mag.

11284
05:26:46,280 --> 05:26:46,760
Yeah.

11285
05:26:47,540 --> 05:26:48,080
Uh...

11286
05:26:48,080 --> 05:26:48,860
Okay.

11287
05:26:51,780 --> 05:26:53,140
Did you just grab...

11288
05:26:53,140 --> 05:26:54,720
Um, 20-20?

11289
05:26:54,980 --> 05:26:56,920
Yeah, but I'm gonna try to find a...

11290
05:26:57,540 --> 05:26:58,080
Okay.

11291
05:26:58,400 --> 05:26:58,720
R.E.

11292
05:26:58,960 --> 05:27:00,000
R.E.?

11293
05:27:00,000 --> 05:27:02,680
Yeah, I just wanted to put it on my gun first.

11294
05:27:06,920 --> 05:27:08,240
I need R.E.

11295
05:27:08,260 --> 05:27:08,340
Oh, I'm trying to count.

11296
05:27:10,920 --> 05:27:11,460
Okay.

11297
05:27:11,940 --> 05:27:13,060
R.E.?

11298
05:27:13,640 --> 05:27:14,180
Yeah.

11299
05:27:15,300 --> 05:27:15,840
Okay.

11300
05:27:18,280 --> 05:27:18,960
This is it.

11301
05:27:20,500 --> 05:27:21,420
This is it.

11302
05:27:22,820 --> 05:27:23,540
We believe!

11303
05:27:24,120 --> 05:27:25,040
We need R.E.

11304
05:27:28,220 --> 05:27:28,700
Please.

11305
05:27:29,040 --> 05:27:29,940
Okay, let's go to zone.

11306
05:27:30,600 --> 05:27:32,680
Let's just slowly head to zone.

11307
05:27:33,900 --> 05:27:34,380
Alright.

11308
05:27:34,840 --> 05:27:37,500
Where is zone gonna end?

11309
05:27:39,040 --> 05:27:40,000
Um, Skyhook.

11310
05:27:40,140 --> 05:27:41,420
Okay, let's go to Skyhook.

11311
05:27:42,080 --> 05:27:42,820
Okay, okay.

11312
05:27:44,460 --> 05:27:46,140
Oh my god, I see your syringes.

11313
05:27:46,420 --> 05:27:47,300
If you see extra health...

11314
05:27:48,280 --> 05:27:48,920
That's not good.

11315
05:27:52,440 --> 05:27:53,300
I believe.

11316
05:27:54,520 --> 05:27:55,820
We need to keep believing.

11317
05:27:56,460 --> 05:27:58,100
Oh, one team landed.

11318
05:27:58,560 --> 05:28:00,800
They're flying to Skyhook.

11319
05:28:00,980 --> 05:28:01,540
I mean...

11320
05:28:01,540 --> 05:28:03,000
We could just walk, honestly.

11321
05:28:03,360 --> 05:28:03,800
Okay.

11322
05:28:04,860 --> 05:28:07,140
I don't think we need to redeploy.

11323
05:28:07,180 --> 05:28:07,960
We can just walk over.

11324
05:28:11,250 --> 05:28:12,470
I don't see them.

11325
05:28:17,300 --> 05:28:18,340
I bet...

11326
05:28:18,340 --> 05:28:21,080
Ditto, you're gonna run into three men and die.

11327
05:28:24,200 --> 05:28:24,760
Ditto, you're gonna run into three men and die.

11328
05:28:24,760 --> 05:28:25,300
I knew it.

11329
05:28:26,420 --> 05:28:27,500
Okay, Uto, Uto.

11330
05:28:28,320 --> 05:28:29,200
Go in front.

11331
05:28:29,440 --> 05:28:31,020
This time, we go together.

11332
05:28:31,120 --> 05:28:31,800
No, no, no.

11333
05:28:31,920 --> 05:28:33,460
Uto goes in front.

11334
05:28:38,440 --> 05:28:39,720
Uto defends us.

11335
05:28:40,940 --> 05:28:41,460
Okay.

11336
05:28:44,580 --> 05:28:46,040
I want that.

11337
05:28:49,320 --> 05:28:49,840
What?

11338
05:28:49,900 --> 05:28:50,320
You see someone?

11339
05:28:51,120 --> 05:28:51,600
No.

11340
05:28:52,220 --> 05:28:53,080
Armor, armor.

11341
05:28:53,360 --> 05:28:54,680
No, we don't need it.

11342
05:28:54,780 --> 05:28:55,400
We don't need it.

11343
05:28:56,380 --> 05:28:57,340
We're strong.

11344
05:28:58,860 --> 05:29:00,040
Okay, I believe you.

11345
05:29:00,580 --> 05:29:01,940
Yeah, believe in me.

11346
05:29:02,820 --> 05:29:05,000
If we die, it's not my fault.

11347
05:29:05,220 --> 05:29:06,860
It's not my fault if we die.

11348
05:29:09,040 --> 05:29:09,520
Believe.

11349
05:29:10,540 --> 05:29:11,260
Gotta believe.

11350
05:29:11,420 --> 05:29:12,220
We just gotta keep believing.

11351
05:29:12,380 --> 05:29:15,120
The reason why we keep dying is because we stop believing.

11352
05:29:16,380 --> 05:29:17,340
I believe.

11353
05:29:17,340 --> 05:29:21,120
Maybe I think I have never believed it at first.

11354
05:29:21,260 --> 05:29:22,120
You didn't believe!

11355
05:29:22,600 --> 05:29:23,360
What's wrong?

11356
05:29:24,880 --> 05:29:26,440
No, I'm believing.

11357
05:29:27,080 --> 05:29:28,020
Okay, okay, okay.

11358
05:29:28,220 --> 05:29:29,860
Is this why we're still playing?

11359
05:29:30,080 --> 05:29:32,120
I feel like that's a pro team.

11360
05:29:32,260 --> 05:29:33,660
The Horizon Octane.

11361
05:29:34,740 --> 05:29:38,280
Because usually pro teams...

11362
05:29:38,280 --> 05:29:40,180
Or like, not pro team, but like...

11363
05:29:40,840 --> 05:29:41,600
Pred team?

11364
05:29:41,760 --> 05:29:43,660
Pred teams, they put...

11365
05:29:44,480 --> 05:29:46,240
They put streamer mode.

11366
05:29:46,280 --> 05:29:46,520
Okay.

11367
05:29:47,340 --> 05:29:47,840
I see.

11368
05:29:47,940 --> 05:29:49,060
Did you get RE?

11369
05:29:49,400 --> 05:29:50,580
I got it, I got it.

11370
05:29:50,600 --> 05:29:51,040
I found one.

11371
05:29:51,400 --> 05:29:52,080
Okay, okay, okay.

11372
05:29:53,300 --> 05:29:55,160
Majority of streamers put streamer mode on.

11373
05:29:55,600 --> 05:29:57,520
Because they don't want to get sniped.

11374
05:29:59,500 --> 05:30:00,920
I mean, which is obvious.

11375
05:30:01,600 --> 05:30:02,000
Whoa!

11376
05:30:03,680 --> 05:30:04,080
Wait.

11377
05:30:06,060 --> 05:30:07,480
Oh my god, there's...

11378
05:30:07,480 --> 05:30:08,220
There's a lot.

11379
05:30:11,340 --> 05:30:13,220
Wait, you... Okay, you can't...

11380
05:30:13,220 --> 05:30:14,040
You can't have it.

11381
05:30:14,140 --> 05:30:14,440
Me?

11382
05:30:15,600 --> 05:30:16,700
Okay, but I have RE.

11383
05:30:18,100 --> 05:30:19,060
Oh, really?

11384
05:30:19,620 --> 05:30:20,100
Hmm?

11385
05:30:22,020 --> 05:30:22,740
Is that...

11386
05:30:22,740 --> 05:30:25,080
Is EVA 8 good?

11387
05:30:25,340 --> 05:30:26,620
Yeah, EVA 8 is broken.

11388
05:30:28,760 --> 05:30:29,240
Okay.

11389
05:30:29,620 --> 05:30:30,640
Someone needs to get it.

11390
05:30:30,640 --> 05:30:31,620
Because it's actually strong.

11391
05:30:31,760 --> 05:30:33,020
Yeah, EVA 8 very strong.

11392
05:30:33,060 --> 05:30:33,340
Oh no!

11393
05:30:33,960 --> 05:30:34,740
Um, wait.

11394
05:30:35,020 --> 05:30:37,000
I think it's... it's taken.

11395
05:30:37,280 --> 05:30:37,760
What?

11396
05:30:37,880 --> 05:30:39,020
No, no, it's right here.

11397
05:30:39,460 --> 05:30:40,340
Right here?

11398
05:30:40,480 --> 05:30:41,100
No, it's in the box.

11399
05:30:41,160 --> 05:30:41,460
Right here.

11400
05:30:42,720 --> 05:30:43,680
This box?

11401
05:30:43,780 --> 05:30:44,020
Yeah.

11402
05:30:44,140 --> 05:30:44,520
Okay.

11403
05:30:44,600 --> 05:30:45,400
No one took it.

11404
05:30:48,440 --> 05:30:49,440
Oh my god.

11405
05:30:50,880 --> 05:30:51,400
Um...

11406
05:30:51,400 --> 05:30:51,800
Uh...

11407
05:30:54,160 --> 05:30:54,680
Believe!

11408
05:30:54,680 --> 05:30:55,540
Okay, believe!

11409
05:30:55,840 --> 05:30:57,180
Why are you not believing?

11410
05:30:57,400 --> 05:30:57,860
Ditto.

11411
05:30:58,240 --> 05:30:59,260
Okay, believe, believe.

11412
05:30:59,360 --> 05:31:00,000
Okay, I'm believing.

11413
05:31:00,280 --> 05:31:01,000
Okay, good.

11414
05:31:01,120 --> 05:31:02,100

11415
05:31:02,420 --> 05:31:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11416
05:31:03,240 --> 05:31:03,940
Keep believing!

11417
05:31:04,500 --> 05:31:05,440
Wait, they're rezzing.

11418
05:31:08,140 --> 05:31:09,580
Another team here too.

11419
05:31:09,780 --> 05:31:11,060
I think we can wait a little bit.

11420
05:31:12,000 --> 05:31:12,860
Team here.

11421
05:31:14,200 --> 05:31:14,720
Okay.

11422
05:31:14,720 --> 05:31:15,240
Yeah.

11423
05:31:17,340 --> 05:31:18,640
Oh, they're... someone's pushing them.

11424
05:31:21,040 --> 05:31:21,740
Cracked the horizon?

11425
05:31:22,960 --> 05:31:23,920
Oh, so low!

11426
05:31:24,360 --> 05:31:25,160
Very low!

11427
05:31:26,420 --> 05:31:26,780
Nice!

11428
05:31:30,420 --> 05:31:30,780
Nice.

11429
05:31:30,780 --> 05:31:31,140
Push?

11430
05:31:31,460 --> 05:31:31,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

11431
05:31:31,940 --> 05:31:32,500
Push, push, push, push!

11432
05:31:34,180 --> 05:31:34,800
Two-point!

11433
05:31:34,840 --> 05:31:35,440
Go, go, go, go!

11434
05:31:36,620 --> 05:31:37,240
Oh my god!

11435
05:31:37,300 --> 05:31:37,820
Oh, my...

11436
05:31:37,820 --> 05:31:41,680
Oh, we got the kill!

11437
05:31:41,700 --> 05:31:42,080
We got the kill!

11438
05:31:43,340 --> 05:31:44,000
Careful, careful!

11439
05:31:44,220 --> 05:31:44,900
I don't think we...

11440
05:31:44,900 --> 05:31:45,140
Another team!

11441
05:31:45,160 --> 05:31:46,500
Another team!

11442
05:31:46,580 --> 05:31:47,220
Another team?

11443
05:31:47,340 --> 05:31:48,060
Okay, okay.

11444
05:31:49,480 --> 05:31:49,880
Careful, Ditto!

11445
05:31:49,960 --> 05:31:50,620
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto!

11446
05:31:51,600 --> 05:31:52,300
I don't have Q!

11447
05:31:52,400 --> 05:31:52,700
I don't have Q!

11448
05:31:52,900 --> 05:31:53,400
Another team!

11449
05:31:53,480 --> 05:31:53,740
Another team!

11450
05:31:53,960 --> 05:31:54,500
I don't have Q!

11451
05:31:56,040 --> 05:31:56,320
Okay.

11452
05:31:57,540 --> 05:31:58,160
I have Q!

11453
05:31:58,300 --> 05:31:58,540
I have Q!

11454
05:31:58,700 --> 05:31:59,300
Baby, come to me!

11455
05:32:00,980 --> 05:32:01,500
Come to me!

11456
05:32:01,520 --> 05:32:01,920
Come to me, Ditto!

11457
05:32:02,280 --> 05:32:02,680
Fall back!

11458
05:32:02,840 --> 05:32:03,160
Okay, okay.

11459
05:32:04,380 --> 05:32:05,100
Okay, go back!

11460
05:32:05,240 --> 05:32:06,660
Fall back, fall back, cause there's a...

11461
05:32:07,500 --> 05:32:08,160
Okay, okay.

11462
05:32:08,260 --> 05:32:09,020
I'm back, I'm back.

11463
05:32:09,200 --> 05:32:09,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11464
05:32:09,940 --> 05:32:10,840
We can...

11465
05:32:11,600 --> 05:32:13,420
go on the outside, I feel like.

11466
05:32:14,820 --> 05:32:15,960
Actually, we can...

11467
05:32:15,960 --> 05:32:16,680
Where do we go?

11468
05:32:17,280 --> 05:32:17,880
Inside the building!

11469
05:32:17,980 --> 05:32:18,360
Inside the building!

11470
05:32:18,500 --> 05:32:18,660
Yeah, yeah.

11471
05:32:18,760 --> 05:32:19,300
Do you want to go outside?

11472
05:32:19,480 --> 05:32:19,720
I got the bat!

11473
05:32:19,760 --> 05:32:20,460
I got the bat first!

11474
05:32:23,100 --> 05:32:23,920
We can stay here.

11475
05:32:24,780 --> 05:32:25,640
We can go here.

11476
05:32:25,800 --> 05:32:26,580
Stay here for now.

11477
05:32:26,640 --> 05:32:27,320
I don't want to go...

11478
05:32:27,320 --> 05:32:29,120
there, cause I feel like everybody should shoot us there.

11479
05:32:29,340 --> 05:32:30,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11480
05:32:30,900 --> 05:32:31,220
Okay.

11481
05:32:33,320 --> 05:32:34,980
There's one team have duel.

11482
05:32:35,120 --> 05:32:35,520
Only duel.

11483
05:32:35,760 --> 05:32:36,040
Okay.

11484
05:32:38,800 --> 05:32:40,360
I'm gonna charge my ult.

11485
05:32:43,460 --> 05:32:43,780
Okay.

11486
05:32:43,780 --> 05:32:43,900
Alright.

11487
05:32:47,970 --> 05:32:48,970
I have ult.

11488
05:32:49,170 --> 05:32:49,570
Whoa!

11489
05:32:50,290 --> 05:32:50,810
Careful!

11490
05:32:51,590 --> 05:32:51,610
Wow!

11491
05:32:59,190 --> 05:33:00,450
I'm gonna check our backs.

11492
05:33:00,730 --> 05:33:02,290
There might be someone in the tunnel.

11493
05:33:03,130 --> 05:33:03,650
Okay.

11494
05:33:04,670 --> 05:33:05,790
I'm double checking.

11495
05:33:06,470 --> 05:33:07,250
Safe, safe.

11496
05:33:09,670 --> 05:33:10,910
Oh, so close!

11497
05:33:12,390 --> 05:33:12,910
Whoa!

11498
05:33:13,090 --> 05:33:13,910
Okay, I have Kraber!

11499
05:33:14,010 --> 05:33:14,550
I have Kraber!

11500
05:33:14,790 --> 05:33:14,990
Oh!

11501
05:33:16,190 --> 05:33:17,090
I don't have Q.

11502
05:33:17,310 --> 05:33:18,050
Good luck.

11503
05:33:18,390 --> 05:33:18,870
It's okay.

11504
05:33:18,870 --> 05:33:20,710
I'm good, I'm good.

11505
05:33:20,810 --> 05:33:23,010
But I don't have medkit.

11506
05:33:23,370 --> 05:33:24,570
I have medkit, I have medkit.

11507
05:33:24,770 --> 05:33:25,150
Here.

11508
05:33:25,330 --> 05:33:25,730
Okay.

11509
05:33:25,910 --> 05:33:26,710
I got you.

11510
05:33:28,170 --> 05:33:30,010
We gotta figure out where to go.

11511
05:33:30,110 --> 05:33:30,770
I think we gotta portal.

11512
05:33:31,470 --> 05:33:31,890
Maybe?

11513
05:33:33,190 --> 05:33:33,350
Hmm?

11514
05:33:35,010 --> 05:33:35,850
What Kraber?

11515
05:33:37,350 --> 05:33:38,470
Portal to here?

11516
05:33:39,510 --> 05:33:40,070
Mm-hmm.

11517
05:33:41,910 --> 05:33:42,830
Where do they go?

11518
05:33:42,890 --> 05:33:43,950
Wait, where are they going?

11519
05:33:44,090 --> 05:33:44,450
Oh, wait.

11520
05:33:44,670 --> 05:33:45,730
They're jumping far.

11521
05:33:45,770 --> 05:33:46,150
Yeah, yeah.

11522
05:33:47,130 --> 05:33:48,010
Let's go this way.

11523
05:33:48,870 --> 05:33:49,890
We don't need portal, we can just walk.

11524
05:33:52,670 --> 05:33:53,850
Oh my god, there's...

11525
05:33:54,790 --> 05:33:55,810
It's getting scary.

11526
05:33:55,830 --> 05:33:56,150
I have eight!

11527
05:33:57,190 --> 05:33:58,990
I still have no repeater!

11528
05:34:03,210 --> 05:34:04,110
Oh, there it is.

11529
05:34:04,250 --> 05:34:04,850
I found one.

11530
05:34:09,310 --> 05:34:10,330
Found the repeater.

11531
05:34:11,790 --> 05:34:13,110
We need to get to...

11532
05:34:13,550 --> 05:34:13,930
Um...

11533
05:34:14,350 --> 05:34:16,170
We can go here too.

11534
05:34:18,370 --> 05:34:19,430
Wait, that's not zone, sorry.

11535
05:34:20,090 --> 05:34:20,950
Oh, no, sorry, here.

11536
05:34:21,130 --> 05:34:21,370
No.

11537
05:34:23,430 --> 05:34:24,170
Are we outskirts?

11538
05:34:24,250 --> 05:34:24,770
Do you wanna try out?

11539
05:34:25,050 --> 05:34:27,270
Or... I feel like here is better.

11540
05:34:28,010 --> 05:34:28,450
Okay.

11541
05:34:29,730 --> 05:34:30,610
There's no one here.

11542
05:34:30,830 --> 05:34:31,510
Yeah, there's no one here.

11543
05:34:31,510 --> 05:34:32,730
They're fighting at market.

11544
05:34:33,750 --> 05:34:34,190
Okay.

11545
05:34:34,970 --> 05:34:37,010
And there's people...

11546
05:34:39,670 --> 05:34:41,110
I'm trying to look right now.

11547
05:34:43,750 --> 05:34:44,190
What?

11548
05:34:44,430 --> 05:34:45,610
I can't see them.

11549
05:34:45,750 --> 05:34:46,330
Oh, here?

11550
05:34:47,950 --> 05:34:48,790
Octane over here.

11551
05:34:51,250 --> 05:34:51,610
Okay.

11552
05:34:51,610 --> 05:34:52,330
I don't have an angle.

11553
05:34:53,290 --> 05:34:53,950
I'll go there.

11554
05:34:55,250 --> 05:34:55,610
Okay.

11555
05:34:58,930 --> 05:34:59,290
Uh...

11556
05:35:01,590 --> 05:35:02,690
He saw me!

11557
05:35:03,490 --> 05:35:04,430
Alright, I'm gonna get cross.

11558
05:35:08,800 --> 05:35:10,540
Oh my god, I wish I had a sniper stock.

11559
05:35:10,540 --> 05:35:11,480
Come market, come market!

11560
05:35:13,200 --> 05:35:14,120
Won't you at market?

11561
05:35:16,020 --> 05:35:17,840
So much harder with no sniper stock.

11562
05:35:19,200 --> 05:35:20,000
Can we go there?

11563
05:35:20,260 --> 05:35:20,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11564
05:35:21,120 --> 05:35:21,600
There's enemies.

11565
05:35:22,880 --> 05:35:24,260
I'm safe here too.

11566
05:35:24,920 --> 05:35:25,400
Okay.

11567
05:35:25,760 --> 05:35:28,120
I just wanna... I'll stay here for now for a cross.

11568
05:35:29,440 --> 05:35:29,920
Mhm.

11569
05:35:30,200 --> 05:35:30,880
Are they here?

11570
05:35:31,400 --> 05:35:32,760
I don't know where... I think they're here.

11571
05:35:32,920 --> 05:35:34,160
the other team is.

11572
05:35:37,880 --> 05:35:38,360
Okay.

11573
05:35:38,540 --> 05:35:39,040
Hey, hey, hey!

11574
05:35:39,340 --> 05:35:40,060
Is that right?

11575
05:35:40,440 --> 05:35:40,920
Behind.

11576
05:35:42,000 --> 05:35:43,840
Oh, the high ground team.

11577
05:35:44,260 --> 05:35:45,740
I think we have to go...

11578
05:35:45,740 --> 05:35:46,040
Ah!

11579
05:35:46,780 --> 05:35:47,260
Shit!

11580
05:35:48,420 --> 05:35:49,740
Oh my god!

11581
05:35:49,900 --> 05:35:50,380
Ah!

11582
05:35:51,100 --> 05:35:51,300
Ah!

11583
05:35:53,320 --> 05:35:54,300
Oh my god!

11584
05:35:55,120 --> 05:35:55,640
Okay.

11585
05:36:03,720 --> 05:36:06,200
I think we should go under, right?

11586
05:36:06,600 --> 05:36:07,120
Okay.

11587
05:36:07,620 --> 05:36:08,480
Do we portal?

11588
05:36:08,720 --> 05:36:09,180
Um...

11589
05:36:09,180 --> 05:36:09,760
For it?

11590
05:36:09,900 --> 05:36:10,420
Maybe?

11591
05:36:11,020 --> 05:36:12,000
I don't have portal.

11592
05:36:12,680 --> 05:36:13,440
Like Uto.

11593
05:36:13,620 --> 05:36:14,340
Uto has portal.

11594
05:36:14,540 --> 05:36:14,780
Oh, Uto.

11595
05:36:14,860 --> 05:36:15,100
Okay.

11596
05:36:15,360 --> 05:36:16,380
Uto, can you?

11597
05:36:17,040 --> 05:36:18,080
Can you...

11598
05:36:18,080 --> 05:36:18,940
Uto, portal...

11599
05:36:18,940 --> 05:36:20,600
Maybe portal under?

11600
05:36:21,000 --> 05:36:21,800
Portal under.

11601
05:36:22,740 --> 05:36:23,260
Okay.

11602
05:36:23,400 --> 05:36:24,360
I believe in you.

11603
05:36:24,940 --> 05:36:25,640
Fuck that.

11604
05:36:25,760 --> 05:36:27,540
Whoever made that fucking...

11605
05:36:28,960 --> 05:36:30,180
cover... light flash.

11606
05:36:30,380 --> 05:36:30,720
We got her.

11607
05:36:34,990 --> 05:36:35,690
Is it safe?

11608
05:36:36,670 --> 05:36:37,170
Safe, safe.

11609
05:36:37,270 --> 05:36:37,910
We got the goal!

11610
05:36:38,030 --> 05:36:38,390
We got the goal!

11611
05:36:38,430 --> 05:36:38,890
Oh shit!

11612
05:36:38,950 --> 05:36:39,250
Damn!

11613
05:36:39,430 --> 05:36:39,770
Yes!

11614
05:36:43,010 --> 05:36:43,730
Oh, the flag.

11615
05:36:44,550 --> 05:36:45,130
Careful, careful.

11616
05:36:45,470 --> 05:36:45,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11617
05:36:47,990 --> 05:36:48,710
I'm gonna bat.

11618
05:36:51,570 --> 05:36:51,930
Okay.

11619
05:36:54,130 --> 05:36:54,670
Oh, hold.

11620
05:36:54,690 --> 05:36:55,330
Kraber over here.

11621
05:36:56,630 --> 05:36:56,990
Yeah.

11622
05:36:59,390 --> 05:37:00,130
Safe here too.

11623
05:37:00,330 --> 05:37:00,910
Safe here.

11624
05:37:02,050 --> 05:37:02,410
Okay.

11625
05:37:02,450 --> 05:37:02,690
Okay.

11626
05:37:02,810 --> 05:37:03,390
Yeah.

11627
05:37:03,510 --> 05:37:05,190
If we need to, we can...

11628
05:37:05,190 --> 05:37:06,110
They come here!

11629
05:37:06,210 --> 05:37:06,530
They come here!

11630
05:37:06,670 --> 05:37:06,970
Lace!

11631
05:37:07,030 --> 05:37:07,390
Lace!

11632
05:37:07,430 --> 05:37:07,830
Lace!

11633
05:37:07,830 --> 05:37:08,070
Nice!

11634
05:37:08,090 --> 05:37:08,210
Nice!

11635
05:37:08,250 --> 05:37:08,370
Nice!

11636
05:37:08,650 --> 05:37:09,510
Kill, kill, kill.

11637
05:37:14,650 --> 05:37:15,590
This is safe too.

11638
05:37:15,690 --> 05:37:16,290
Where I am.

11639
05:37:17,050 --> 05:37:17,450
Okay.

11640
05:37:21,240 --> 05:37:22,740
Is there a sniper stock in there?

11641
05:37:22,860 --> 05:37:23,420
Can you check?

11642
05:37:25,200 --> 05:37:26,820
Can you check if sniper stock?

11643
05:37:28,520 --> 05:37:28,920
Sniper?

11644
05:37:29,280 --> 05:37:29,920
Sniper stock.

11645
05:37:31,340 --> 05:37:32,320
I don't know.

11646
05:37:32,520 --> 05:37:32,760
Okay.

11647
05:37:32,840 --> 05:37:33,660
Can you check real fast?

11648
05:37:33,760 --> 05:37:34,020
Yeah, yeah.

11649
05:37:34,020 --> 05:37:34,680
I need sniper stock.

11650
05:37:34,920 --> 05:37:35,820
I need this.

11651
05:37:36,000 --> 05:37:37,380
Um... No, no, no, no.

11652
05:37:37,400 --> 05:37:37,520
Okay.

11653
05:37:39,080 --> 05:37:39,560
Okay.

11654
05:37:39,580 --> 05:37:40,440
Don't have it.

11655
05:37:41,840 --> 05:37:45,160
I think it's like a team here and then above us.

11656
05:37:45,220 --> 05:37:45,300
Yeah.

11657
05:37:45,300 --> 05:37:46,060
The Kraber team.

11658
05:37:46,300 --> 05:37:46,700
Yeah.

11659
05:37:47,060 --> 05:37:47,780
Kraber here.

11660
05:37:47,940 --> 05:37:48,220
Kraber here.

11661
05:37:48,220 --> 05:37:48,620
Oh, no, no.

11662
05:37:48,620 --> 05:37:49,500
We killed the Kraber team.

11663
05:37:49,720 --> 05:37:50,360
Oh, you killed Kraber?

11664
05:37:50,360 --> 05:37:50,880
Yeah, there's no Kraber team.

11665
05:37:52,400 --> 05:37:52,880
Okay.

11666
05:37:53,340 --> 05:37:54,780
The team above us.

11667
05:37:54,820 --> 05:37:56,640
The team above us has...

11668
05:37:56,640 --> 05:37:57,980
I mean, I can...

11669
05:37:57,980 --> 05:37:59,440
I can...

11670
05:37:59,440 --> 05:38:01,420
I can alt the center.

11671
05:38:01,660 --> 05:38:02,760
Where is the center?

11672
05:38:03,100 --> 05:38:03,840
Let's move here.

11673
05:38:05,140 --> 05:38:05,620
Yeah.

11674
05:38:05,700 --> 05:38:06,540
I have to alt this.

11675
05:38:09,920 --> 05:38:10,780
Oh, my God.

11676
05:38:17,750 --> 05:38:18,230
Oh...

11677
05:38:20,490 --> 05:38:20,970
Oh...

11678
05:38:24,010 --> 05:38:24,490
Oh...

11679
05:38:24,490 --> 05:38:25,350
Oh...

11680
05:38:28,490 --> 05:38:29,690
Where is the other team?

11681
05:38:30,230 --> 05:38:30,970
Oh, yeah.

11682
05:38:31,170 --> 05:38:31,630
Yeah.

11683
05:38:31,690 --> 05:38:32,270
On the ramp.

11684
05:38:32,430 --> 05:38:33,010
They're on the ramp.

11685
05:38:34,970 --> 05:38:36,530
And then the other team's above us.

11686
05:38:37,990 --> 05:38:38,270
Woah!

11687
05:38:43,400 --> 05:38:44,940
I really can't hear you.

11688
05:38:45,260 --> 05:38:47,860
Don't stop believing.

11689
05:38:49,400 --> 05:38:52,280
Ba da da da da da da da.

11690
05:38:52,360 --> 05:38:55,000
Don't stop believing.

11691
05:38:57,320 --> 05:38:58,680
You can't stop believing!

11692
05:39:01,940 --> 05:39:03,220
I have four R stars.

11693
05:39:04,540 --> 05:39:05,280
We can't stop!

11694
05:39:13,080 --> 05:39:14,080
Oh, f**k you.

11695
05:39:14,120 --> 05:39:14,880
Oh, wait, here, here, here.

11696
05:39:17,160 --> 05:39:17,980
Can I go on?

11697
05:39:32,160 --> 05:39:34,340
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

11698
05:39:34,600 --> 05:39:37,580
Oh my

11699
05:39:43,360 --> 05:39:43,560
god!

11700
05:39:43,720 --> 05:39:44,340
Oh, sorry.

11701
05:39:44,540 --> 05:39:45,480
I got, I got...

11702
05:39:45,480 --> 05:39:46,360
Oh, I'm f**ked.

11703
05:39:48,260 --> 05:39:49,760
They're fighting each other.

11704
05:39:49,900 --> 05:39:50,700
They're fighting me?

11705
05:39:51,120 --> 05:39:51,800
Oh, damn!

11706
05:39:52,740 --> 05:39:53,400
Live, Oto!

11707
05:39:53,720 --> 05:39:54,120
Live!

11708
05:39:54,760 --> 05:39:55,900
I'll let you know, I'll let you know!

11709
05:39:57,140 --> 05:39:57,840
I'll let you know!

11710
05:39:59,300 --> 05:39:59,700
What?

11711
05:39:59,840 --> 05:40:00,700
That's one guy left!

11712
05:40:00,780 --> 05:40:01,440
That's one guy!

11713
05:40:06,620 --> 05:40:07,740
It's one guy!

11714
05:40:07,760 --> 05:40:08,680
I'm blocking him!

11715
05:40:09,220 --> 05:40:10,600
It's one guy!

11716
05:40:21,320 --> 05:40:23,580
We did it!

11717
05:40:24,030 --> 05:40:25,540
I'm talking easy!

11718
05:40:29,010 --> 05:40:30,200
Oh my god.

11719
05:40:30,380 --> 05:40:32,080
We did it!

11720
05:40:32,120 --> 05:40:32,840
We did it!

11721
05:40:40,110 --> 05:40:40,990
Oh, how proud of you!

11722
05:40:41,170 --> 05:40:41,630
All right!

11723
05:40:41,630 --> 05:40:42,330
All right!

11724
05:40:48,600 --> 05:40:50,180
Oh my god.

11725
05:40:50,520 --> 05:40:51,920
Oto, MVP.

11726
05:40:52,980 --> 05:40:54,780
MVP, Oto.

11727
05:40:55,960 --> 05:40:56,820
Yay!

11728
05:40:57,080 --> 05:40:57,560
Yeah!

11729
05:40:57,560 --> 05:40:57,760
Yeah!

Oh my god.

05:41:05,460 --> 05:41:06,760
That was really fun.

11736
05:41:08,940 --> 05:41:09,700
GG's guys.

Goodnight, goodnight!

Have nice lunch dinner.

11744

Okay, okay.

Thank you for playing!

11749
05:41:26,260 --> 05:41:27,660
I had so much fun.

11750
05:41:28,240 --> 05:41:28,760
Baby time!

11751
05:41:28,760 --> 05:41:29,460
Yeah, thank you!

11752
05:41:29,460 --> 05:41:30,100
I'll see you guys.

11753
05:41:30,380 --> 05:41:30,900
Bye!

11754
05:41:31,060 --> 05:41:31,440
See you guys!

11755
05:41:31,780 --> 05:41:32,440
Bye bye!

11756
05:41:33,380 --> 05:41:33,600
Bye!

11757
05:41:33,600 --> 05:41:33,700
Bye!

11758
05:41:35,120 --> 05:41:36,520
Oh my god.

11759
05:41:36,820 --> 05:41:37,720
Well that was...

11760
05:41:38,020 --> 05:41:39,260
That was such a...

11761
05:41:39,260 --> 05:41:41,700
I did not expect to have such a long session!

11762
05:41:42,100 --> 05:41:43,540
It just was really fun.

11763
05:41:43,780 --> 05:41:44,240
It was...

11764
05:41:44,240 --> 05:41:45,900
It was very, very fun.

11765
05:41:45,980 --> 05:41:47,820
I enjoyed playing it with...

11766
05:41:47,820 --> 05:41:48,640
Playing it with...

11767
05:41:48,640 --> 05:41:50,380
Uto and Ditto.

11768
05:41:50,640 --> 05:41:52,180
I always enjoyed playing with them.

11769
05:41:52,420 --> 05:41:53,840
Yes, please check them out.

11770
05:41:54,040 --> 05:41:56,160
They've always been good friends of mine.

11771
05:41:56,220 --> 05:41:56,240
Yeah.

11772
05:41:56,260 --> 05:41:56,800
And...

11773
05:41:56,800 --> 05:41:59,620
Always enjoyed playing Apex with both of them.

11774
05:41:59,900 --> 05:42:00,580
But yes!

11775
05:42:00,740 --> 05:42:02,220
I saw so many membership!

11776
05:42:02,440 --> 05:42:03,060
I'm so sorry!

11777
05:42:03,100 --> 05:42:05,660
I didn't thank all of you guys while I was playing!

11778
05:42:06,020 --> 05:42:07,060
I'm so sorry!

11779
05:42:07,280 --> 05:42:12,400
Usually, like, when I'm in a collab, I try to, like, focus on the collab.

11780
05:42:12,700 --> 05:42:14,200
Like, just interacting with people.

11781
05:42:14,580 --> 05:42:16,420
So, I'm so sorry.

11782
05:42:16,560 --> 05:42:17,500
But thank you, everybody!

11783
05:42:17,800 --> 05:42:20,480
I saw so many 50 gifted ships!

11784
05:42:20,620 --> 05:42:21,380
It was crazy!

11785
05:42:21,720 --> 05:42:23,300
Beats, thank you for the 50 gifted ships!

11786
05:42:23,440 --> 05:42:23,700
Thank you!

11787
05:42:23,700 --> 05:42:24,260
Thank you!

11788
05:42:24,280 --> 05:42:26,240
And thank you all for the super chat!

11789
05:42:26,240 --> 05:42:27,920
I hope you guys had a lot of fun!

11790
05:42:28,100 --> 05:42:30,040
It was a very long session, so I...

11791
05:42:30,040 --> 05:42:32,160
It was also a very long VOD.

11792
05:42:32,380 --> 05:42:34,780
So, I hope you guys had fun watching.

11793
05:42:35,080 --> 05:42:39,140
I really did enjoy playing with the both of them.

11794
05:42:39,400 --> 05:42:44,000
Tomorrow is also another collab with Yuuson with Inside the Backrooms.

11795
05:42:44,840 --> 05:42:45,600
So, yeah!

11796
05:42:45,700 --> 05:42:47,980
I'm gonna enjoy playing that as well!

11797
05:42:48,560 --> 05:42:49,440
Thank you, everybody!

11798
05:42:49,780 --> 05:42:51,380
I am gonna pass out now.

11799
05:42:51,420 --> 05:42:52,100
I'm so tired.

11800
05:42:52,200 --> 05:42:53,340
Okay, I didn't tell you guys.

11801
05:42:53,480 --> 05:42:56,200
But I woke up at, like, 5 in the morning.

11802
05:42:56,200 --> 05:42:57,340
And I've been awake since!

11803
05:42:58,260 --> 05:42:59,460
I've been awake!

11804
05:43:03,700 --> 05:43:04,580
So, yeah!

11805
05:43:04,640 --> 05:43:07,920
My sleep schedule still hasn't been fixed yet.

11806
05:43:07,980 --> 05:43:09,200
But we had a fun time watching!

11807
05:43:09,360 --> 05:43:14,120
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

11808
05:43:14,340 --> 05:43:16,320
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed!

11809
05:43:16,540 --> 05:43:18,060
Because you deserve it!

11810
05:43:18,280 --> 05:43:19,840
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

11811
05:43:20,440 --> 05:43:21,280
Bye, guys!

11812
05:43:21,820 --> 05:43:22,260
Bye!
