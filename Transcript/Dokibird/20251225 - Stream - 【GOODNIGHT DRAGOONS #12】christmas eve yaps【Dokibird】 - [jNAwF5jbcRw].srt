1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:23,690
Thank you.

2
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,180
Thank you.

3
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,110
This is what I was doing.

4
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,110
This is what I was doing.

5
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,790
I was like, even this way.

6
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,030
I was trying to put on this reindeer.

7
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,950
And it's like, oh my god, I thought it'd be so easy.

8
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,850
I was like, okay, I'll do this like 20 minutes before the
street.

9
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,090
It was not easy.

10
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,330
It was not easy, but look, look at me, I'm a reindeer.

11
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,550
Oh my god, okay, then I was trying to figure out like, cause
like you could change the colors.

12
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,690
I was like, how the fuck do you change the colors?

13
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,470
They're like, I was reading the instructions and it was
saying like, oh yeah, don't worry, ask toggles to change the

14
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,470
colors.

15
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:49,330
And I'm like, how the fuck did they did they didn't list
they didn't list what the toggles were So I was trying to

16
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:57,410
figure out what the fuck were the keys or this I was like
fuck this is it and it was One two three four it was look I

17
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:04,610
have buddies look it's brown now and then I have it comes in
red I don't know if I like I don't know it comes in red and

18
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:11,810
then I have like these little buddies And then there's it
comes in black and it comes in green and that is all the

19
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,850
toggles it I think that's all of them, but I thought it was
so cute.

20
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,610
Yeah, it's RGB odd.

21
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,450
I don't know.

22
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,270
I think green is my favorite So I did the green version or
the white version.

23
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,570
The only thing I don't like is the it's the snowman guys
like what are you doing here?

24
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,630
It's RGB.

25
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,550
Yeah.

26
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,690
Okay, guys.

27
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,550
So that is that is why I was late.

28
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,390
Turkey with your red eyes so bright won't you guys dance
late tonight.

29
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,850
Thank you.

30
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,670
The rich and selfish.

31
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,190
Thank you.

32
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:41,950

Oh, Jakarta, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank

34
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,350
Merry Christmas, Eve, reindeer, doki, just wrapped up a
Christmas Eve party.

35
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,390
I'm only going to be ready to relax with some panidoki,
laughter, and cheer the dragons.

36
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,090
Thank you for streaming tonight.

37
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,870
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

38
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,950
Yeah, I know, I was like, earlier today, yesterday, I was
like, do I do a night stream, evening stream, or an

39
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,790
afternoon stream?

40
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,110
I was like, fuck it, I'll do both in the spirit of the
holidays.

41
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,910
I'll do both.

42
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:21,190
them obviously won't be a very long good night dragon stream
i'm gonna cap myself for around an hour or so an hour and a

43
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,630
half max because tomorrow is where we're doing the big
stream i don't want to tire myself out because i still have

44
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,470
to prep for tomorrow i still have to get all the assets
going on for like what i want to use for it and also like

45
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,770
i'm still prepping for the 900k stuff too So there's a lot
of stuff going.

46
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,590
I'm really, really behind.

47
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,390
I should have prepped it on the 22nd and 23rd instead of
going outside.

48
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,330
But I had to do the Costco ride.

49
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,630
And I had to go to the Christmas market.

50
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,530
So that's not me.

51
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,770
Like Pat Stokey fucked me up.

52
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,230
Heck, I think of a Super Chat.

53
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,090
Thank you.

54
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,570
Merry Christmas, Stokey.

55
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,610
Are you at a dinner or are you shooting dinner this year?

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,870
I hope you have a happy 2026.

57

Thank you.

60
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,550
I am never the prey.

61
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,310
Always the predator.

62
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,110
I am rank one in the tier list of prey and predator.

63
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,970
I am the top of the food chain.

64
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,250
Solid snake.

65
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,170

69
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:24,790
It was worth it.

70
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,330

71
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,650

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,350
I told you.

83
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,470
It was worth it.

84
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,490
I told you.

85
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,110
Look how fucking cute this is.

86
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:45,850
Wow, oh my god, I'm a reindeer I was wanting to play around

I had to cut it, see?

93
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,170
You know how when you had to...

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,210
So I trimmed my feathers real quick.

96
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,790
Because I had to put on...

138
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,650
I died.

139
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,570
Think of the super chat.

140
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:23,790
Thank you.

141
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,310
Thank you.

142
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:36,210
I'm trying not to like I luckily I ordered a bunch of those
like the Chinese syrup not how are they called the little

143
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:43,290
syrup things that all the professional voice actors and
singers use to make sure their voice don't don't collapse on

144
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:50,490
itself so I ordered a bunch of those a couple of days ago so
I'm definitely gonna have some of the have like a like a

145
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:57,510
spoonful of the the syrup things at the pay pie pay pie goal
I think that's what it's called yeah yeah pay pie goal I

146
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:04,970
don't know how I actually pronounce it but I bought a bunch
of those so I bought the little packet ones the spoon ones.

147
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:12,510
I hate dealing with the jars because they're so, it's so
like hard to clean because they're really sticky because the

148
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:20,370
thing, if you ever have sore throat or you have like vocal
issues, I highly recommend it because all professional

149
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:27,170
singers and professional singers and voice actors use it
because it actually works.

150
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:35,210
Like you literally just like take like I guess like a
spoonful and like in works for your throat because it coats

151
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:43,670
your throat with like a syrup and um and also like the next
day your throat basically feels like good as new um uh but

152
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:51,030
yeah i don't get the the jars because they're so sticky and
hard to clean um especially for the spoons too so i get the

153
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:58,490
little packet ones the travel size where you can just like
cut the packet and then you'll and then it's you're good and

154
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,870
then you don't have to worry about it anymore um and it's
just very convenient i'm I'm just very lazy and it's very

155
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,290
convenient for me.

156
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,370
Smug.

157
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,370
Wait, did I read?

158
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,910

Felice Navida.

170
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,930
Bomb, bomb.

171
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,930
Felice Navida.

172
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:25,770
Wow.

173
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,610
Oh yeah, it's almost Christmas in an hour for the Easties.

174
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,250
Please, Namita, have a great Christmas, Doki and Dragos.

175
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,150
Thank you for the super chat.

176
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,430
Thank you.

177
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,030
Thank you.

178
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,470
I really appreciate it, guys.

179
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,450
I do hope you guys have a wonderful, wonderful Christmas and
your holidays.

180
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:51,030
I do appreciate all those who are here right now to spend
there to, I guess, like, end the day, end your Christmas Eve

181
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,410
with me.

182
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,610
I really do appreciate it a lot.

183
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:52,990
All right.

184
00:10:53,030 --> 00:11:01,890
Anyway, I do want to talk about the GSC that Xbox has
confirmed that the size of GTA 4 is 676 gigabytes.

185
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:17,210
I was like, holy fuck, like how, I don't own consoles
anymore, but like, if GTA 6 is 676 gigabytes, I'm, I'm

186
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:27,110
worried about that P, I assume they optimize it for PC, I
hope they optimize it for PC, because who the fuck has 676

187
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,550
gigabytes on their fucking, oh thank God, oh thank God, okay
guys.

188
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,450
Okay, I just...

189
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,830
Okay, guys, it's been debunked.

190
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,510
Okay, sorry.

191
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,070
I was spreading fake news.

192
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,750
I checked the tweet.

193
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:42,990
Oh, thank God.

194
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,750
Okay, Merry Christmas, everyone.

195
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,790
It's a Christmas miracle.

196
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,090
It just got debunked.

197
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:47,990
It literally...

198
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,770
I had this tweet open the entire day, trying to figure out
if this shit was real or not.

199
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,630
And because there was no fucking...

200
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,030
There was no...

201
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,630
There was no fucking...

202
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,910
What was it called?

203
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,850
The note?

204
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,350
Adding context thing.

205
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,570
What is it called the the fact it's a Christmas miracle.

206
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,070
Oh my yeah

207
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:19,190
Like when they add the the community note there was no
community note for fucking hours So I was like there's no

208
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,190
way and they got me they fucking got me.

209
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:29,490
I was like there's no fucking way that This is six hundred
and six seventy six gigabytes because I do I I do have that

210
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,570
amount of space But I have to use my other hard drive Oh my
god.

211
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,690
No, no, this guy, everyone was freaking out.

212
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,690
There was no community note for the longest time.

213
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,830
It just got community noted 11 hours ago.

214
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,390
Thank God.

215
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,970
It means spreading wisdom.

216
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
It's a Christmas miracle.

217
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,270
Now you feel better that it's not 676 gigabytes.

218
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,010
Ramona, thank you for the Akasupa.

219
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,170

Yeah.

230
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:21,750
Yeah, it freaked me out Um, because like people were like
freaking out in the replies to I was like, there's no

231
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,650
community Yeah, also, okay, but this one's real guys.

232
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,170
This one's real.

233
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,730
Did you guys see the the the souls like based on India?

234
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,370
I actually really want to play this game.

235
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,830
There's a new Souls-like game that's based off of India.

236
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,110
And it actually looks crazy good.

237
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,910
Yeah, when it's real, it was an AI.

238
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,630
People were like, oh my god.

239
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,670
No, the fight scene is fucking crazy.

240
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,490
Wait, I gotta show you guys the...

241
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,830
Because he makes poses every time he like...

242
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,350
I think every time he parries, he makes a fucking pose or
some shit.

243
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,490
Let me see if I can find it.

244
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,110
It's actually crazy.

245
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,570
I think it was this one.

246
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,150
It's like a fucking Bollywood.

247
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:02,970
Oh, it's here.

248
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,190
Okay, it's here.

249
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,810
Like those goddamn zoomins, like the Bollywood zoomins and
shit.

250
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,830
Okay, here.

251
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,570
Yeah, it's like he's literally aura farming.

252
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,920
I thought it was, I thought it was a AI at first.

253
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,940
Cause like the original video was like this random like 420
at 4, 4, 4, sorry.

254
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,980
What was the quality?

255
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm going to look at it.

256
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:44,220
uh 240 it was like 240p on a tick tock video but this guy
like recorded the tick tock video on his phone and it was

257
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,900
like 240p quality so i assumed that it was ai but then
people in the comments were like no this is a real game and

258
00:14:51,900 --> 00:15:01,780
i wish list it i actually wish list it and i found out they

here's the context of the patriot game games.

267
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,240
Here's the context on the Patriot games.

268
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:24,200
So it was announced that next year they're going to have the
Patriot games to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the

269
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,300
United States of America.

270
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:36,200
And what they're doing is that each state is going to send
in one male and one female athlete, teenagers by teenage

271
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:49,720
female and male athlete to represent their state and and
they're all gonna compete for a multi-day event to see which

280
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,340
Wait, what's wrong with Texas?

281
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, wait.

282
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay, wait.

283
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,300
Okay, there's going to be really fucked up.

284
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,600
I have to look up this.

285
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,740
I don't want to say it in case I fuck up.

286
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,580
Oh, wait.

287
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,520
That's not true.

288
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,100
Okay.

289
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,920
I was looking at...

290
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,740
Okay, I will tell you guys what I Googled.

291
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,400
I won't...

292
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,440
I'll be very transparent so you know I'm real.

293
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,940
I instantly Googled top states for obesity.

294
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,360
Okay.

295
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,880
Sorry, because the guys were like, Texas.

296
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,580
And I was like, oh, is that part of the, is that, are they
in the list?

297
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I was like, I was like, are they on the list?

298
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
I was like, that's like, but they're not.

299
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,320
Texas isn't in there.

300
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,200
That's the first thought I thought of, because I was like,
why would you, why would Texas be like the worst performing

301
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,740
state?

302
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not.

303
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,880
Rank one is West Virginia.

304
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,960
What about whopping 40?

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,140
Okay, wait, teenager.

306
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,280
Okay, I'll do like...

307
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,600
Most obese state for teenagers.

308
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,480
Because it's like, for adults, it's like, oh, it's still
West Virginia.

309
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,640
It's 24%.

310
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,440
Actually, no.

311
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,540
Mississippi is number two for adult obesity.

312
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,060
But Mississippi is number one for youth obesity.

313
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,280
But number, so West Virginia is number one.

314
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,280
for adults, but number two for the youths.

315
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,440
So, like, you guys are battling it out.

316
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,300
Uh, nothing to do in West Virginia, but eat.

317
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,140
Any West Virginians?

318
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,820
I mean, that food must be really good, right?

319
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,280
In West Virginia?

320
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,580
Any West Virginians in my chat that can vouch for that?

321
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,540
Um, I used to play college balling.

322
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:05,260
No, it It's not, like, but you would assume the food is
really good, though.

323
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,360
Omnistate, maybe.

324
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,880
You don't need good food at all, damn.

325
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,360
Wait, is West Virginia?

326
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,060
Is that where the corn comes from?

327
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,440
Is that where the...

328
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,280
Okay, for those in one context, I was trying to...

329
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,580
to figure out where the corn comes from in America.

330
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,440
My initial thought was Kansas because of, for those who
didn't watch the Haiti stream, I was like, oh, does corn

331
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,860
come from Kansas?

332
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,120
Because my, where I got that from is from Wizard of Oz.

333
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,980
And when Dorothy is like, oh, we're not in Kansas no more.

334
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,500
So that's why I know she's from Kansas.

335
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,820
And then like, she lives on a farm and on that farm is just
all corn.

336
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:59,680
So I would assume that the corn grows in Kansas because, you
know, that corn.

337
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,150
But do they also grow them corn in West Virginia?

338
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,290
Plenty of corn in India.

339
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,430
Oh, I know about that.

340
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,210
I know Indiana loves their corn too.

341
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,870
Also, I don't know geography.

342
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,150
No, 100% do not know much about.

343
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,810
I feel like I know more about European countries than I do
about geography of my own country and America.

344
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,890
Jesus, thank you for the super chat.

345
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,890
Thank you.

346
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,110
There are many points.

347
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,530
Oh my god.

348
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,670
They got low obesity and high altitude.

349
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,550
Oh, that's true.

350
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,590
Colorado is where all the mountains are.

351
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,390
I don't even know this because I used to watch the creatures
and they used to live in Colorado.

352
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,610
Also, apparently really cheap taxes.

353
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,190
Oh, I found out.

354
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,050
I found out a lot of place.

355
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,530
A lot.

356
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,410
I was like wondering.

357
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,630
I was like, why is everything filmed in like Atlanta slash
Georgia?

358
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,050
I was so confused because like I was looking up like, I was
looking up like movies.

359
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:17,510
uh films and tv show and film are only filmed in like three
places it's like alanta slash georgia uh uh vancouver and uh

360
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:26,330
one more i don't remember what it was film play most common
places to film oh yeah it's because of taxes it's because

361
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:35,550
the government pays you too uh Which one was it?

362
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,150
In Toronto?

363
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,390
And I was like reading it.

364
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,250
Because like apparently for Georgia.

365
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,450
Because like Stranger Things.

366
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,270
Was filmed in Georgia.

367
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:45,610
Yeah.

368
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,810
So I was like super surprised about that.

369
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,450
A lot of famous TV shows.

370
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,790
Is actually filmed in.

371
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,450
Um.

372
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,570
In like Vancouver or Georgia.

373
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:54,550
And.

374
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,330
Um.

375
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,690
And I was like reading up on it.

376
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,590
Because I've always won.

377
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,090
Because like.

378
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,750
Uh.

379
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,830
Apparently in.

380
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,690
For America.

381
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,770
For America.

382
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,910
The Georgia government.

383
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:10,250
Pays them to pays the people to film like to make films in
their state.

384
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,730
So, I mean, that's smart, you know, it's good it's good
tourism too.

385
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,450
Yeah, apparently it's like really good tourism.

386
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:25,050
And then and then the reason why they choose Vancouver for
filming is because you can make Vancouver look like America.

387
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,830
I thought it was like, oh, it's it's they're so America
passing.

388
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,330
Yeah, and also taxes too.

389
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,130
It's apparently like the least taxed country.

390
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:40,630
It's why everyone moved to Texas for one point because like,
you guys might not, I don't know if you guys might notice

391
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:48,530
this, but a couple of years ago, almost every con, before
there was LA, every content creator would live in Texas,

392
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:54,150
like every, all the content creators because like it had the
cheapest taxes for entertainers.

393
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,770
So that's why they do that because they get taxed at least.

394
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,130
They love to do like, you know, tax evasion and shit like
that.

395
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,410
Yeah, Texas is incredibly cheap, but so fucking hot.

396
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,150
Yeah, so I thought it was really interesting.

397
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,190
And then I was reading it.

398
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,570
They're like, oh, yeah, Vancouver has like mountains, lakes,
and the city.

399
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:20,550
So they'll be like, all right, we can literally pretend
they're traveling everywhere, but they're just in one area.

400
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,410
I was just like, that's so smart.

401
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,870
They're like, all right, they're like, all right, we're
going to go to a different state, but they're still in

402
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,110
Vancouver.

403
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,510
Like, they just changed the perspective of where they're
filming.

404
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,150
Like, that's so fucking smart.

405
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,950
Shadow, thank you for the magenta soup.

406
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,210
Thank you, thank you.

407
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,970
Doki, Merry Christmas, and thank you for another amazing
year filled with your contagious laughter and whimsy.

408
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,450
Hope you have a good Christmas and get some good food.

409
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,650
Merry Christmas to all dragons also.

410
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,970
Stay safe, everyone, and enjoy your day.

411
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,530
Thank you for the magenta soup, thank you, thank you.

412
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,730
Wait, Texas is banning anime?

413
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,290
Wait, is that true?

414
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,930
When did that happen?

415
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,130
Extra, extra.

416
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,810
Read all about it.

417
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,150
Texas says no more anime women.

418
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,010
Could a new Texas law.

419
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,990
Oh, it's just...

420
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,650
They're not actually banning anime, guys.

421
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,430
Okay.

422
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,490
Oh, my God.

423
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,230
Okay, I'm not reading this article.

424
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:37,090
no no it's not anime it's mostly ai it's you know what they
were trying to ban they're trying to ban ai pornography

425
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:51,050
that's it's not the same guys it's it's not the same um
chicago thank you for the super chat thank you thank you um

426
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:57,190
exactly why for a moment the twin heads they actually call
it New Hollywood for all the Philly names filmed there.

427
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,110
Thank you for the super chat.

428
00:25:59,410 --> 00:25:59,650
Thank you.

429
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:00,670
Thank you.

430
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,270
That's not...

431
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,650
Alright.

432
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,150
Apparently they said that it could be grouped into it.

433
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,510
I don't think so.

434
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,330
I think it's fine.

435
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,830
There's no way because there's a big anime convention in
Texas.

436
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,870
I don't remember what it's called, but I remember there is a
big anime convention there.

437
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,790
Oh my, did I see the video of the guy being like...

438
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:34,210
is what if mario was made by triple a my triple a game
publisher oh my god i wish i owned it i saved it that shit

439
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:47,930
was so good listen m wait mario focus m that shit was so
okay here you go

440
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:58,920
and there's people who haven't read it who haven't listened
to it yet it's actually so cringe But it's so, it's cringe

441
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,020
in a way where it's like, it's too real that I cringed at
it.

442
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,760
It was the most Chris Pratt dialogue.

443
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,720
But Mario is Triple A.

444
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,460
Um, wait, um, if Mario was invented, uh, this year, maybe
that's a better phrase.

445
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,960
It's like, what if Mario was invented this year by a Triple
A publisher?

446
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,880
That's not Nintendo.

447
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,060
Focus him.

448
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,430
It's so good.

449
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,810
It's actually so good.

450
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,320
I still can't believe we're getting a real hunger games.

451
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,700
You know, that's going to get so many.

452
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,320
Oh my god, so many people are going to be watching.

453
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,880
I swear to God, if it's not public access, like, they
must...

454
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:01,060
Like, I swear to God, if this is paywall for the Patriot
games, I would be so fucking sad.

455
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:11,960
It's like every state is participating so it's like it
should be like streamed on YouTube like I just want to know

456
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,140
I just I just I want to be there like don't pay like are
they gonna pay Oh my god, it's gonna be like Saturday.

457
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,360
It's gonna be like every fucking American TV show where you
can't watch We it's like Saturday Night Live because you

458
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,200
can't Canadians are part of Saturday apparently

459
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,680
C holds the rights to the Patriot Games.

460
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,400
Just like the Olympics.

461
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,240
I swear to God.

462
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,660
I remembered like, um, I think I was like traveling in
America or some shit.

463
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,020
I think like when one Olympics was going on and it's like
region locked to, it was, it's like not region locked, but

464
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,200
you know, you can only watch it on one network because they
own the rights to the Olympics.

465
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,540
It's gonna be paid.

466
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,220
Oh, yeah, speaking of, I saw someone mention about gambling.

467
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,580
Um, but like, but like, bro, Jake Paul made so much fucking
money from the box.

468
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,880
Bro, like, I mean, maybe, I mean, he's not getting those
brain cells back, but he doesn't matter.

469
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,960
He made 66 million dollars.

470
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,840
Like, did you guys hear that?

471
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,460
They're like, bro, that match was so fucking rigged, bro.

472
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:48,260
Like, that, uh, yeah, like, Um, for those who don't know,
uh, Jake Paul did a boxing match with, like, a fucking

473
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:56,280
number one number one boxers, uh, of our time, um, and,
like, one of the, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

474
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,840
I'm not really into boxing, um, but, like, you know,
everyone saw the memes, you know, it's crazy that he smiled,

475
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:13,940
though, when he fucking punched his ass, um, but, basically,
I'm, he, he makes, I think, like, around, Oh my god, let me

476
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:22,080
I sent I sent this to someone Let me get the link for it
Because like I was telling this to one of my friends Because

477
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,880
they were like talking about the boxing match I was like,
you know that match is rigged, right?

478
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,780
And he's like, what do you mean by rigged?

479
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:37,640
And I'm like, bro The longer Jake Paul stays alive Like
alive?

480
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:50,140
That's the wrong way to phrase it But, oh, I didn't send the
link, but the longer he survives per round, the more he gets

481
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,580
paid.

482
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,260
I think it was like, it was like 5.5 million per round.

483
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,820
So, um, by him, because like, everyone was like, there's no
way he would last the six rounds.

484
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,280
Like, just, like, you could tell he was just fucking running
away.

485
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,380
He's got, God was so fucking scared.

486
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,300
Wait, I must have saved it, so wait, let me check.

487
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,200
I'm gonna check.

488
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:21,260
I know I like sent this to someone because I thought that
shit was so funny There's like a screenshot There's like a

489
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,180
screenshot of like him like running away and everything.

490
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:36,960
It was so fucking funny Let me see I could find it And like
he looked like the hamster The fucking scared ass hamster.

491
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Oh my god.

492
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,960
I'm so sad.

493
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,340
That's how he was during the entire fight.

520
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,700
The guy's like, like, this guy looks like he's like, I'm not

There's No, this smile isn't edited.

525
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:35,080

he perks his eyebrows But that's that and like the smile is

526
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,640
more prominent.

527
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,000
This one is not edited This is like his legit face when he
was doing the punching.

528

I saw the edited version because I thought that was real But
then people were like no no this is actually the real feel.

00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,420
Yeah, this is the unedited one by the way The edited one is
he's like he does the he does the DreamWorks eyes.

530
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,860
He does like I can't do it on my face.

531
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,940
He does the dream work face in the editor one.

532
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,060
Yeah.

like Um of this random boy band dancing in a retirement home
and their fourth member is like on the PC Dancing with them

550
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:19,180
so like that shit has been like That shit has been like
stuck in my head for so long so this shit was like a legit

551
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:31,760
it came from so um and then i swear to god it's all satire
from this but like and i found out that this they have a

552
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,420
tick tock account this group has a tick tock it's so funny
i'm sorry i watched like almost all their videos but it's so

553
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:45,320
funny because because they're like trying to get their
friend like his name was like danish danish or something

554
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,680
wait what's his name what is his name their fourth members
in India.

555
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,660
I'm Darshan.

556
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,940
Okay, so Darshan's fourth member is like, yeah, it's like
literally, it's like Little New Island.

557
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,980
So their fourth member is Darshan from India.

558
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,880
And they keep like green screening.

559
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,920
They would like green screen in the video.

560
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,700
They're like, um, like, we're trying to get Darshan a visa
so he can come perform for us.

561
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,800
Perform with us in America.

562
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,360
Sorry, Doki.

563
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,200
I found my new Oshi.

564
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,420
And his name is Darshan.

565
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,000
No, I swear it's actually, I don't know.

566
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,600
I think it's so fucking funny.

567
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:37,740
Because, like, apparently two of them, two of them have been
trying, like, trying to actually make a music career for,

568
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,920
like, years.

569
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,560
For, like, five-plus years.

570
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,880
And they've been, like, constantly auditioning for American
Idol, like, non-stop, but would never get on TV.

571
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,580
So they're like, we're going to create our own boy pen
called Boy Throb.

572
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,060
Apparently, they asked the internet to be like, oh, what
should we be called?

573
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,340
And I think like, oh yeah, they're like, what name should we
call them?

574
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,380
And of course, the internet being the internet suggests a
really, really bad name for them as their first choice.

575
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,300
That's their first choice.

576
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,700
So they went with their second choice.

577
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,020
I don't know if I could say what their first choice was.

578
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,780
It might be related to some files.

579
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,760
So, I can't really say what the first choice is.

580
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,420
But their second choice was boy throb.

581
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,160
Rise with, it might be a file of some sort.

582
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:41,560
And then, apparently, their immigration lawyer was like, do
not name your bandit or we will not be able to get a visa

583
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,340
for Darshan.

584
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,960
So they were like, okay, we're going to be the boy throb.

585
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,500
Which at least, it's not, it's bad.

586
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,860
But not as bad as the first choice that the viewers voted
for.

587
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,160
Um, but like, it's been like, I swear to God, like, this
shit has been, like, on my mind.

588
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:07,880
Because they're like, please get us a million, a million
subscribe followers so we could get Darshan a visa.

589
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,900
And literally, they made their account two months ago.

590
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,540
They got a million followers in two months.

591
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,940
That's fucking crazy.

592
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,980
But like, so people, so the two of the members.

593
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,860
were like super serious about actually singing and dancing
and creating a boy band but they could like never get in so

594
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:32,900
they're like fuck this we're just gonna make like a comedy
group and it's working it's actually working also that their

595
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:39,200
third member is a lawyer he's like hello i'm and i'm a
lawyer and i'm like what did the tall guy

596
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,700
honestly true the fucking darshan buff i could it's just i
don't know i just it's been like on my mind.

597
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,520
I've actually been following them because it's just fucking
so stupid.

598
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,920
If it works, it works, you know.

599
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,360
Bro, they gotta get, bro, they gotta get him a visa, bro.

600
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,400
Yeah, I wanna see them.

601
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,800
I wanna see them at a, being an opener at a concert.

602
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,380
They outsourced their fourth member.

603
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,520
That's like crazy.

604
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,610
Wait, I told you!

605
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,970
I told doing so fucking good

606
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:39,590
Oh my god So Darshan can come into America

607
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,310
Oh, yeah, they do they have an official music they they
actually released their first song And I would have to say

608
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,790
their first song is actually a banger Like it's not like
satire at all.

619
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:28,470
apparently um this is what i talked about before but um but
you poop little when it happens because they don't tell you

620
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:37,730
that the doctors don't tell you that the shows don't tell
you this you know how i learned about this from saturday

621
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:49,290
night live and when i found out i was like you poop when you
get burned so like some of you guys might be poop babies

622
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:57,350
just so you know your mother's will never tell you i don't
know if they'll ever But some of us were poop babies.

623
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,610
Yeah.

624
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,490
So, because, you know, you're pushing.

625
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,830
So, anyway.

626
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:07,790
Anyway.

627
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,230
I found out recently.

628
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,730
Poop babies are stronger.

629
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:16,970
I've decided.

630
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,270
Oh, look at him.

631
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,410
Mr. Fancy Fass being a C-section baby.

632
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,410
Oh, Mr. Fancy.

633
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:39,090
man over here gets to be cut open from the belly anyway
anyway so I found out about this like a couple of days ago

634
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:51,030
but baby heads were born flat usually because if you're if
your moms are always like lying down during pregnancy um all

635
00:42:51,030 --> 00:43:02,750
the weight of the baby's head would like distribute like
horizontally so so because of that um and like because of

636
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:08,530
that a lot of babies heads are born flat and for the first
couple of months it's super malleable that's why you're not

637
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:17,710
supposed by the way do not poke a baby's head that's and
their head and skull is like super squishy so because of

638
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:27,790
that um if the baby is always lying down they will have a
fucking long ass head so if whose head is super long and

639
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,570
flat, they were a lazy baby.

640
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,330
They hurt.

641
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:38,350
So, because, like, they're supposed to be sitting upright.

642
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,650
They're mostly, like, you're supposed to be sitting upright.

643
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:49,410
Or, apparently, parents are supposed to buy these fucking
helmets for babies to wear, to, like, physically shape,

644
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,510
don't be me, to physically shape their heads to be a round
size.

645
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,830
I was so surprised because I was like, what the fuck do you
mean?

646
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:04,990
Like, like, apparently doctors would be like compliment,
will compliment babies by being like, wow, your baby's head

647
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,150
was born so round.

648
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:06,970
Good for you.

649
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,670
And I'm like, what the fuck does that mean?

650
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,130
Like, I guess I would read that.

651
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,610
I was like, what the fuck is that?

652
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,370
Are baby's heads not supposed to be round?

653
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,690
What shape are they supposed to be?

654
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:27,450
And yeah, so like, babe, like some parents will spend like
hundreds of dollars to make sure their baby's head is round

655
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:35,210
so yeah so wait let me show you guys the photo of it
apparently costs hundreds of dollars dude i was like what

656
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,990
the fuck let me see oh yeah here we go yeah 700 $100
helmets.

657
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,970
Yeah, so they have to wear these, like, headgear to, like, I
like how they're, like, passables.

658
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,690
Yeah, I didn't realize they're real.

659
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,150
Yeah, you gotta optimize your child.

660
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,030
It's because you're...

661
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,550
That's why babies...

662
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,350
You have to, like, Make sure the baby isn't lying down and
mostly sitting upright.

663
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:21,050
So your head isn't like, your head isn't like, you know,
fucking being spilled over.

664
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,630
You gotta customize the baby.

665
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,950
Yeah, because if they're lying down too much, the head is
just flat as fuck.

666
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,580
Like, so I was like, hope your baby's doing okay.

667
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,830
Wait, can you bonsai tree or a baby?

668
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,570
That's what they used to do in the old days.

669
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,770
We don't do that anymore because apparently it's frowned
upon by society.

670
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,970
No, it's actually true.

671
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,070
I think it was the Incas.

672
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,230
I think, or the Aztec times.

673
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:17,330
But back in the day, people would like shape their head,
like shape baby's heads into like...

674
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,350
Oh, it's Peruvian.

675
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,730
Okay.

676
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,010
They would shape it into like an actual alien head where it
would be like...

677
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,490
Would be like really tall or some shit.

678
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:25,810
Yeah.

679
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:32,030
Yeah, so it's like, yeah, apparently it's legal now.

680
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,670
It's like found upon the society.

681
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,310
I don't know why, though.

682
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:52,430
Yeah, like people used to, like, back then, people did shape
their baby's heads.

683
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,570
Because they were like, whoa, we can make it in any shape we
want.

684
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:09,110
like for the ancient meme that reminds me there's this guy
that that uh built a handsome squidward statue and then left

685
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:17,790
it the body of the ocean to freak out future uh future
scientists or anthropologists that is such a fucking great

686
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:29,170
prank like no i it's just i it just sucks that he won't live
to see the result it's just well i wish i could like be

687
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:34,650
immortal just to see how react to that prank that shit is so
good

688
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:46,820
the longest cognac generational trolling like they're kids
kids kids like and then he should like write a piece of

689
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:54,000
letter to his future uh great great great great great great
grand kid to be like open this letter when they find the

690
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:05,240
statue in the ocean and it's just and then the kid will be
like oh my god this letter has been passed down by great

691
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:12,660
grandfather and like we never knew what he meant by that but
it finally happened and then the letter would be like ha got

692
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:21,160
him it's just yeah it's yeah it's just got him

693
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:31,240
that makes me so paranoid that not paranoid but it makes me

00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,550
You know she made millions off of that too.

762
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,650
I mean, it's also the first...

763
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:45,790
To be fair, I will say it's the first Fortnite skin to bring
back boobs.

764
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:51,250
I remember I told you guys this, but for those who didn't
know, when they got more family friendly, they literally

765
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,450
covered up everybody.

766
00:55:53,410 --> 00:56:01,590
They were like all the Fortnite skins that had even a little
bit of is showing they covered it up they literally patch

767
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:07,970
the hole up so like everyone's like oh my god kim
kardashians they brought it back they brought back the boobs

768
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:12,350
oh my god what would the children

769
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:23,110
think before yeah so like there would be like a fortnight
skins where there would be like boop windows and everything

770
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,850
because it's like part of the design like the original
design or some Or like they would have show like just a

771
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:35,150
little line, you know a little bit of the line and then And
then fortnight went through the family friendly phase and

772
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:42,350
they literally patched the hole They like added like they
just covered it up like it's like Fox kids or some shit.

773
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:52,510
Yeah It's like they got like you know like when Fox kids
when they like edit the like edit the clips and everything

774
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:59,770
then patch up all the violence and the guns where they
replace guns with like bats or some shit in four kids or

775
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:05,890
like oh my god I think my favorite part was when I think it
was like a one I think it was one piece or some shit I think

776
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:13,630
it was like it was a Zoro where she was like crucified or
something and then and then and then four kids was like we

777
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:25,530
can't show the cross on anime on a kid show we can't compare
him we can't compare Zoro to Jesus Christ We got it.

778
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,470
We got to cover up the cross.

779
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:39,350
Yeah I was like that one was my favorite I was like they
literally censored the cross They're like not you're not

780
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:42,190
Jesus we can't let you have that.

781
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:53,730
Oh, yeah, no cigarette to a lollipop I will say Well, uh,
four kids did one thing right and that was giving anime some

782
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,970
Bangor intros.

783
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,750
You can't change my mind.

784
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,130
They're very iconic.

785
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,090
The one-piece rap.

786
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,790
It was a banger.

787
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,330

788
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:17,550

Adap English intros.

791
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,190
We're so fucking iconic, though.

792
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:30,870
Like, instead of butterfly, we got Digimon, Digital
Monsters.

793
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:41,650
Like, and it just, it's literally just, like, six words
repeated non-stop.

794
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,290
And it was iconic as hell.

795
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,970
Digimon, the champions, Digimon, did.

796
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,560
Digimon are the...

797
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,560

802
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,180
fight.

803
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,480
And it looked so good.

804
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,320
I was watching, I was like, what the fuck is this?

805
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:08,800
actually it fucking goes hard it looks sick like he just
like you start spamming cards and shit like it's an actual

806
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:21,960
Dragon Ball Z fighter mod where you can play Yu-Gi-Oh yeah
and there's also other there's other ones too where you can

807
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:33,860
summon the sky dragon and the exodia he literally summons
the I trust everything to this card.

808
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,320
Now, Exodia's seal has been broken.

809
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,660
Behold, it's gorgeous free.

810
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,920
Exodia, it was an obliterate.

811
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,380
And then it's fucking Cell.

812
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,040
And then he fucking kills Cell.

813
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:44,840
It's crazy.

814
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,610
I think Exodia one was the fucking...

815
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,530
It was the fucking craziest one.

816
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,890
Monster card.

817
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,150

Every time I close my eyes, I think about the Roman Empire.

And then even when my eyes are open, I still think about the
Roman Empire.

846
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,080

Thank you, thank you.

860
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,920
Yeah, here's my social media.

861
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,360
Here's what my algorithm looks like, and that's why you know
when you know why I'm like this.

862
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,780
So I saw this tweet.

863
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,920
I saw this tweet like a couple of days ago.

864
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:06,760
What?

865
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,560
Yeah, two days ago.

866
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:18,120
Because like, if anyone watched for NAF2, William Afton,
like, is in a dream sequence, and he falls back, but like,

867
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,620
they filmed it, like, upright.

868
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,540
And I was like, wait, that's fucking funny.

869
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,720
And someone in the Twitter was like, why the fuck didn't he
like fall on an actual green mat?

870
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:33,740
And my favorite reply to it was like, because he'll always
come back.

871
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,760
So I was like, because he'll die.

872
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,940
And so I was like, but he'll always come back.

873
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,080
I was like, that's so fucking good, bro.

874
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,600
That's so good.

875
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,130
Also because, yeah, no, this guy's old.

876
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:01,430
Like, he's gonna fucking break his neck or some shit.

877
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,250
Yeah, it's his thing.

878
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,600
The FNAF 2 movie failed.

879
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,760
It's better than FNAF 1.

880
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,340
No, FNAF 1 was so fucking stupid.

881
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:16,960
I'm sorry.

882
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,460
I, you cannot change my mind.

883
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,540
There were so many plot holes in FNAF 1.

884
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,800
But FNAF 2 made...

885
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,980
I love the part.

886
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:32,420
where it got into like Godzilla versus King Kong so there is
a scene I'll give you guys a little there's a spoiler

887
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:39,880
warning but there's a scene where it's like the old at the
FNAF 1 animatronics versus FNAF 2 animatronics I swear to

888
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:46,220
God it felt like Godzilla versus King Kong where they're
just like they like they start fucking it wasn't even a

889
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:54,040
fight it was really like FNAF 1 people like fucking the FNAF
1 animatronics like ripping apart the FNAF 2 animatronics

890
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,420
but it was so So fucking stupid.

891
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:03,360
Yeah, it's like a Kaiju death match, but it lasted like five
seconds.

892
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,570
This ruined Christmas.

893
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,570
How does this not sound more stupid than FNAF one?

894
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:24,870
Because FNAF 2 didn't have the fucking scene where the child
was like, I know how to stop them.

895
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:33,530
Drew a picture of the animatronics ripping apart William
Afton and It pinned it on the fucking wall and then it

896
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:37,910
worked like there was no fucking Foreshadowing or lead up to
this.

897
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:42,130
I'm like how the fuck did you figure this out like?

898
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:50,570
I was just like how the fuck did this child figure that's so
stupid.

899
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:51,350
It's so stupid.

900
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:59,410
It's been months, but I'll still that that part Still gets
me It's so fucking stupid.

901
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:05,330
Oh, yeah and the aunt lives by the way the aunt is alive
they never show her again they just said oh yeah she's

902
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:12,410
fucking she was crazy and now she's like committed to a
mental asylum by the way because she's like i saw the

903
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:19,610
animatronics and they try to kill me and like it was just
like um exposition dump where they're trying to be like what

904
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:26,890
happened to the aunt and they're like oh yeah she's like in
the mental asylum now like she's she's like in rehab right

905
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,530
now because everyone

906
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:41,020
but they say in the very beginning of the FNAF 2 movie
because that's what everyone was wondering they were like

907
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:49,220
what the fuck happened to the uh to the odd I will have to
say I don't understand like okay I haven't watched uh you

908
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:58,620
know how like like Blumhouse is like the um the forefront uh
the forefront for like horror movies now like they are like

909
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:08,460
everyone like goes to them for like the hold on all the
current generation of the current horror movie characters i

910
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:19,720
have no idea how what's her name the fucking dancing robot
is like a horror character i don't know to be fair i've only

911
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:28,240
seen the trailers but even then the trailers portray her as
like comedic as like it's like a comedy trailer where she

912
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:35,600
fucking starts dancing and everything Megan yes is it Megan
the robot like but she's like plastered everywhere as like

913
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:47,920
the next horror icon and I'm like okay like she is iconic
yeah fuck you like it's like it's not a horror I swear to

914
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:54,500
God I should try and watch it but like I would assume the
first movie was more horror geared and then after that it

915
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:02,900
becomes like a comedy movie yeah it feels like an action
comedy film because like there was a trailer i think it was

916
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:11,240
like a trailer where um blumhouse did a collab with was it
pepsi or mountain was it pepsi or mountain dew but they did

917
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:22,300
a collab with like all of blumhouse's uh most popular horror
films and it was like finnaf um the phone call one oh fanta

918
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:27,880
sorry they are by the way you guys didn't know a lot of the
soda companies are owned by like one or two companies.

919
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,340
Nesty, I think Nesty is owned by Coke, right?

920
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,340
I know Fanta is owned by like either Pepsi or Coke.

921
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,300
It's one of them.

922
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,740
They literally have a monopoly on soda.

923
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,340
Yeah.

924
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:44,000
And then like, it was like Blackphone, FNAV, and Megan.

925
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,420
And I forgot the fourth one was Jason, right?

926
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:50,990
Yeah.

927
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:54,150
So, and then I'm like, how the fuck is... Oh yeah, Chucky.

928
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:54,910
It was Chucky.

929
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:55,630
Yeah.

930
01:09:55,730 --> 01:10:05,390
Chucky was there and I'm like how the fuck is bro Megan

937
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:08,750

01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:10,130

939
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,730
Yeah, she murders!

940
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,570
But she just starts...

941
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:14,590
And then she...

942
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:16,170
And the thing is, she...

943
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,130
She dances all the time now!

944
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,780
What the fuck?

945
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,600
There's no way this is an official.

946
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:39,750
Murder is not scary, apparently, from Doki Bird.

947
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:48,330
She's emoting!

948
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,910
Bro, that's so true.

949
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,890
It's fucking emoting.

950
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:54,630
Palapar, thank you for the super chat.

951
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,430
Thank you, thank you.

952
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:58,470
It's through Nestle, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi.

953
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,810
Yeah, none of them own each other.

954
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,530
Yeah, also like, what was it?

955
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:07,390
I know like, wait, water company owned by Coke.

956
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:08,930
What was it?

957
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:10,390
The seat, Dasani.

958
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:14,230
Dasani is owned by Coca-Cola.

959
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:20,110
They also own water, too.

960
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:24,230
And Pepsi owns Aquafina.

961
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:27,910
That's why you have Aquafina versus Dasani.

962
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:30,590
Oh yeah, Pepsi is greedy.

963
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:33,050
They have like four different water companies.

964
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,550
What the fuck?

965
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:37,670
Why do you need four water companies?

966
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:39,230
One of them will work.

967
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,910
Yeah, they own water.

968
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:43,590
Yeah, Pepsi owns four different water companies.

969
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,470
Dasani is the worst water.

970
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,270
started using AI for their ads.

971
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,110
It's not even good AI, it's too.

972
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:55,390
It's actually pretty bad.

973
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:56,690
The ads are terrible.

974
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:00,750
I miss like, I miss when Coca-Cola actually paid lots of
money.

975
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,890
Like, actually, like, have really good ads.

976
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:09,490
But to be fair, I'm, like, thinking, I think they don't care
about ads anymore because they have such a huge monopoly on,

977
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:13,890
like, water, like, not just water, like, on water and soda.

978
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:19,190
So I think, like, they don't really need to sell Coke
because everyone buys Coke now.

979
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:29,250
Like, like, people go to Coke anyway, so, so, like, they
don't really, yeah, they don't even need to, like, actually

980
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,910
advertise it.

981
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,290
Not anymore, so they don't care anymore.

982
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:40,590
Because back then, it was always Coke versus Pepsi, but I
don't think people really drink Pepsi anymore.

983
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,110
Yeah, they won, it's like the console wars, but they won.

984
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:49,170
It's like how PlayStation won the console wars against Xbox.

985
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:53,190
And then PC just rolls up and...

986
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,260
And PC Master Race...

987
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,010
Oh!

988
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,870
Sorry, that's from Flash Kids.

989
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,850
Yeah.

990
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:11,230
Sorry, that was a Flash Kids quote if anyone watches the
console wars.

991
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:12,910
Okay, love that video.

992
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:20,380
I'm one of the Master Race PC Master Race.

993
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,910
I hope you'll always be happy.

994
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:29,710
Love, thank you.

995
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:30,910
Thank you for the super chat.

996
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:31,910
Not A9.

997
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:32,230
Thank you.

998
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:33,010
Thank you.

999
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,640
Don't say that.

1000
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,460
Oh my God.

1001
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:40,900
Zero punctuation.

1002
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,600
Oh my God.

1003
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:43,260
That's a throwback.

1004
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,080
I actually used to watch those videos too before it like,
before they like exploded.

1005
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,120
Because their company was really bad or some shit.

1006
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:57,370
Yeah.

1007
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:05,970
pretty sure like i think it's just like coca-cola one so
they don't care anymore uh koi welcome to tomato farm

1008
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:15,630
welcome welcome yeah they imploded yeah escapist yeah i feel
like it's because like nobody reads gaming blogs anymore at

1009
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:22,450
that time like yeah like literally the only thing that was
keeping them relevant was zero punctuation um but even then

1010
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:31,370
they were like slowly falling off um then people would like
you know back then people don't really use social media they

1011
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:39,430
just like they they just browse like kotaku oh my god kotaku
i actually used to browse kotaku all the time when i was

1012
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:46,150
younger um is everyone would just literally just go on
gaming blogs and everything and then now everyone just looks

1013
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:57,570
at twitter like me just a filthy twitter user i would look i
would read kotaku for gaming news because that was like the

1014
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,310
only place for me to get gaming news.

1015
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:02,670
It was literally the only place for me to get gaming news,
guys.

1016
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:04,230
And also April Fool's.

1017
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:07,470
I'll go to Kotaku.

1018
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,550
Just like, especially for April Fool's.

1019
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:13,750
Just to be like, what did companies do on April Fool's?

1020
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:16,630
What?

1021
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,150
It was the thing back then.

1022
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,210
What do you mean?

1023
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:21,970
I don't do it anymore.

1024
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:27,170
It was a thing back then, guys.

1025
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:27,950
Oh,

1026
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:41,260
man.

1027
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,560
There was something I wanted to talk about.

1028
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,280
Wait, let me second.

1029
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:43,640
Remember.

1030
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,680
It was like during the middle of my Megan rant.

1031
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,980
I was like thinking about it.

1032
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:53,520
I don't remember.

1033
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,040
I don't remember.

1034
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,620
Hey, Mario.

1035
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,040
Let me get a large double olive pizza.

1036
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,840
Scotty, thank you for the super chat.

1037
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:04,320
Thank you.

1038
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,180
Thank you.

1039
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,640
How was it?

1040
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:09,640
I don't remember.

1041
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,300
remember

1042
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:17,750
I was the target audience

1043
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:29,440
I think like speaking of that speaking of like the console
wars I think people might go back to console because it's

1044
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:42,380
just not like PC gaming will become like what's so weird
it'll be like just catered to the people can afford it

1045
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,880
people with the spending money to afford it.

1046
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,760
I think, yeah, it's, yeah, because it's like, it'll be like,
it's not affordable anymore.

1047
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:56,780
I don't know, I feel like, I feel like, does console use RAM
too?

1048
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,940
How much, I mean, obviously, yeah, but like, it doesn't use
as much RAM, right?

1049
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,320
Or is it luxury?

1050
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:11,000
Oh, I thought they used less RAM versus PC.

1051
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,480
What game?

1052
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,310
Oh, no.

1053
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,920
No, my Marvel arrival queues will be longer.

1054
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,480
No!

1055
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:26,960
No!

1056
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,260
Yeah, I think gaming's gonna be a luxury soon.

1057
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,940
It's over.

1058
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:38,500
I gotta wait long queues because there's not enough people
playing games.

1059
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,140
You ever read about that?

1060
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,520
Bro, I was saying earlier that You can literally...

1061
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,200
I feel like you can scalp RAM from Costco.

1062
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:51,380
I'm buying a pre-built PC.

1063
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,340
Pop the AI bubble.

1064
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,600
The bubble will eventually burst one day.

1065
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,080
Just like NFTs.

1066
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,210
It'll happen.

1067
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,850
Just like NFTs, guys.

1068
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,230
Not coping.

1069
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:17,590
No, there's some...

1070
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:18,470
I was at Costco.

1071
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,710
I did a Costco run.

1072
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,630
And, like, the, it, like, says it includes the RAM.

1073
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:26,650
It was, like, only $1,000.

1074
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,570
It was, like, 32 gigabytes of RAM.

1075
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,390
And I swear to God, I'm pretty sure people...

1076
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,550
They just hide the RAM.

1077
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:34,390
They, like, unplugged the RAM from the display PCs.

1078
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:37,270
Because I saw the RAM was gone.

1079
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,900
And again, you're becoming a Netflix subscription service.

1080
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:45,680
Oh, my God.

1081
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,120
Remember to put on your tinfoil hat.

1082
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:47,820
They're listening.

1083
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,160
But thank you for the super chat.

1084
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:51,620
Thank you.

1085
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:52,400
Thank you.

1086
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,600
Oh yeah, there was like this test There was this test That

1087
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:22,560
Where they were doing a thing Where they're testing you If
you know if If you know that This name was Was a drug or a

1088
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,920
Pokemon Because it was made by this like Doctor from
pharmacy who was obsessed with Pokemon And they're like See

1089
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,020
if you can figure Girl, which one's a Pokemon and which was
a drug?

1090
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:33,780
And I looked at it.

1091
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:36,200
I was like, there's no way these Pokemon names are real.

1092
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:42,300
That's like, okay, to be fair, I did not pay attention to
the last two generations.

1093
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:48,100
But I was like, bro, these names look like fucking AI
generated, I swear.

1094
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,440
But they're real.

1095
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:51,320
I was so surprised.

1096
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,400
Wait, I'll show you guys.

1097
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,440
Let's see if you guys...

1098
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,380
Let's see if I can get rid of the answers.

1099
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,780
Is that the...

1100
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:05,760
Where's the picture?

1101
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:08,700
Oh no.

1102
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:10,240
Whoops.

1103
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,320
Where the fuck is the image?

1104
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:15,800
Where's this picture?

1105
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,940
What am I holding here?

1106
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:23,140
Oh my god.

1107
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:27,590
Give me a sec guys.

1108
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,050
I might have messed up.

1109
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:35,910
I clicked on the wrong source file

1110
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,800
Alright, there we go

1111
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:54,150
Yeah, I looked at this And I was like What the fuck

1112
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:09,360
I only recognized For the Pokemon names I was like Reller
Reller

1113
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:25,640
really I looked at this and I legitimately only recognized
one Pokemon on here and it was fucking a Q font I don't even

1114
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:36,280
oh not sorry not Q font it was Deoncy because it was like

Yeah, Braxon.

1117
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,880
Yeah, I see Braxon and Deoncy.

1118
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,940
I was like, I was like, what the fuck?

1119
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:04,640
I thought it was a silly.

1120
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,940
I thought it was a fun test.

1121
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:12,000
Besant DPT is cheating.

1122
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,140
That's a Pokemon.

1123
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,200
That's cheating.

1124
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:18,020
Bro, they named it.

1125
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:19,860
They named this.

1126
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,200
What you mean is cheating.

1127
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,640
What the fuck is this?

1128
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:32,750
Poison fairy?

1129
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,270
Oh my god.

1130
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,990

1131
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:39,830
