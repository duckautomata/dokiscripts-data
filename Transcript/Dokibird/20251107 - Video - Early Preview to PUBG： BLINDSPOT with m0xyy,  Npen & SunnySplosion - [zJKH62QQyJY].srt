1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,100
Good morning.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,820
I want to say first off, thank you to PUBG for sponsoring this stream.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,880
But yes, if you guys want to help out this stream, you can scan this QR code and do a survey.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,020
Apparently, there's a lot of stuff.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,740
It's about like what you guys feel about this game from watching the stream after the stream or even like during the stream.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,100
If you guys can do the survey.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,340
And if you do the survey, you have a chance to win a $50 Steam code.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,940
Scan this code or

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
I'll show you guys the characters.

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,820
Like I said, there's like, there's, um, Apex, so, like, you can see.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,060
Oh, my gosh, you can't see.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,760
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,200
Explosive hammer.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,680
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,520
Wait, I know what character to use.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,300
Boom.

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,160
There you go.

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,720
I don't know.

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,540
We smashed.

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,320
This is the smash.

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,560
Okay, but I do have a shotgun.

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:48,900
See?

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,460
How bad is the flash?

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:50,920
Okay.

26
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,860
It's not, okay.

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,200
Yeah, I know.

28
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,860
It's pretty bad.

29
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,620
It's pretty bad.

30
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,300
What's the drill?

31
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,440
Oh, I guess drill camera.

32
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,940
It's like, you start breaching.

33
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,700
Oh, wait, that's cool.

34
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,980
Oh, that's cool.

35
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,900
This is like Intel.

36
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,820
All right, here's the foam grenades.

37
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,380
I can build my own wall.

38
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,360
I can build one wall.

39
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,520
It's all right.

40
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,200
That one wall will clutch it.

41
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,320
This one, I was like, I'm going to heal myself.

42
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,740
And then like, it was just too much prep time.

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,460
Like, I know it was like two seconds, but like, I was getting chased at.

44
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,100
Like, there was no prep time for me.

45
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,400
All right, last girl.

46
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,100
Oh, this one.

47
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,080
This one was, she seems fun.

48
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,940
Only because like, the thing is, you can't really, you can do this.

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:26,140
and just like but also i messed up because i think it's also one bullet or two it depends on if you can grab ammo in time all right apparently i have to make the room i'll make the room right now hello hello hello hello i'm nervous i don't play a lot of tactical shooters so it's all on you moxie very nice did you try out all the characters i did i don't know who i'm gonna play to be wall that he holds out like a giant shield i'm gonna put that shield out yeah i'm gonna put that shield and you just shoot everyone okay okay i don't know they know you can shoot the toes yet so we'll see i oh yeah they probably didn't play the tutorial yeah that's true that's true they probably they probably don't know i don't know if you could change characters during that patch so we gotta commit to this yeah no this has got to be the strat this is we're committing because if we lose like We have no other strap behind.

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,740
Yeah, this is our only strap.

51
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,540
Collision.

52
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,160
Okay, don't shoot my head.

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,040
No, I said I don't see the mark.

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:32,940
Okay, okay.

55
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,740
Yeah, I got your friend.

56
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,080
To our right.

57
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,420
To our right.

58
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,180
Oh, they're the same way.

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,200
They're the same way.

60
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,160
I think they're this way.

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,500
I don't know.

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,040
Do you think they're standing?

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,940
Oh, they're the same strategy.

64
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,140
Don't you.

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,340
Get away.

66
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:43,660
Get away.

67
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh, wait.

68
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,820
Hold it down.

69
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,260
Hold it down.

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,660
Hold it down.

71
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,360
Hold it.

72
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:54,500
I told you, Boxy, the mixture hits the grenade.

73
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,140
I don't have a grenade.

74
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,120
It's just a smoke.

75
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,200
It's just a smoke.

76
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:58,780
Okay.

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Okay.

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,680
They did it himself again They did it himself.

79
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,260
We push up.

80
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,920
We push forward.

81
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Nice.

82
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,220
We push forward.

83
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,020
We're broken up.

84
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,780
I can't like it.

85
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:05,820
Come on.

86
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:05,820
Here.

87
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,440
Come on.

88
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,040
Come on.

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,100
Come on.

90
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,600
Oh, he's on.

91
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:07,780
I'm dead.

92
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm dead.

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,340
I'm dead.

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,940
He's stuck behind.

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,640
What happened?

96
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,480
He's good.

97
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,200
He's good.

98
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,640
He's good.

99
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,040
He's good.

100
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,380
He's good.

101
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:16,560
Okay.

102
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,480
You guys are not bad.

103
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,180
He's good.

104
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,840
Press B and change your character right now.

105
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,840
Oh, you got him?

106
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,280
Yeah.

107
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,640
How do you heal?

108
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,620
I have grenades too.

109
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,460
Okay, I got...

110
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,920
I got...

111
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,520
I have it.

112
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,840
I have it.

113
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,740
I could swap with the swap.

114
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,100
Okay.

115
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:30,960
Because...

116
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,540
Because they're using shields.

117
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,460
You're cheating.

118
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,160
I think our plan...

119
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,760
We should have kept with the shield plan.

120
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm pretty sure.

121
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,560
Okay, I'm here.

122
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm here with the shield.

123
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:40,780
All right.

124
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,620
We got this.

125
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,680
30 seconds.

126
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,320
Oh, my God.

127
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,300
Wait, we can catch up.

128
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,060
That's fine.

129
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,060
Let's do it again.

130
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,560
We were learning.

131
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,920
We were learning.

132
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,900
You know, we were figuring it out.

133
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,040
It took us a while to get the shield going.

134
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,780
The shield...

135
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:52,980
Okay.

136
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,200
She's right...

137
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,520
It's...

138
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:54,600
She's...

139
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,800
Flake him, flake him, flake him, yes!

140
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,060
Oh, behind me.

141
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Oh, no, I'm so fucking.

142
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,880
Oh, my God.

143
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,680
They sandwiched.

144
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,940
We still won.

145
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,700
We still won.

146
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,320
Look at that!

147
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,140
We should have done that.

148
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,200
We should have done that.

149
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,100
No, no, no.

150
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,560
What?

151
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,440
We're winning.

152
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,100
This is so not what I...

153
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,520
I mean, I had a hundred percent play.

154
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,640
Thank goodness for...

155
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:10,920
What?

156
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,700
Honestly, I'm starting to think, like, maybe I'm not that good with a shotgun.

157
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,060
This is the only time I've gotten a kill.

158
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,940
With the guy who has a shield, I've only gotten kills with his gun.

159
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,820
I think they're going to go where we first met them.

160
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
You go in the courtyard.

161
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,860
Yep, yep, yep, you've seen them.

162
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,480
They're deep.

163
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,000
They're deep.

164
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, there's he- he's pulling out a gun.

165
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,740
The other guy has a gun.

166
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,620
The other guy has a gun.

167
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,780
Okay, I'm reloading.

168
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm reloading.

169
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,780
You got this.

170
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,300
Nice, nice, nice.

171
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,740
He's one.

172
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,240
He's one.

173
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,920
Oh, he's so close.

174
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:36,920
I'm here.

175
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm here as well.

176
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,320
She's one.

177
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,400
She's one.

178
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,360
Oh, he's speaking.

179
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:40,840
He's so low.

180
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,520
He's so low.

181
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,960
I'm here.

182
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,360
I'm here as well.

183
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,360
She's one.

184
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,360
She's one.

185
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,360

Oh, he's speaking.

187
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,360
He's so low.

188
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,360

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,920

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:51,840
Nice.

194
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,420
Oh, he's speaking.

195
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,640
He's so low.

196
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,260
He's so low.

197
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm pushing.

198
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:24,980

199
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,200
we're just, look, we're just bloodthirsty, okay?

200
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
We don't, we can't be patient.

201
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,620
We're just alpha.

202
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,540
Yeah, we're just, yeah, yeah, we're just alphaing it.

203
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,700
Okay, yeah, that's it.

204
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,200
Okay, this is search and destroy.

205
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,340
So, you know, like, how we have to plant or, like, breach walls.

206
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,140
So, we're attacking right now.

207
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,100
So, I don't know what to play.

208
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,160
Yeah, I'm not sure.

209
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,360
I'm not sure.

210
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
Maybe I should bring you a hammer guy out.

211
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,640
Because this is closed quarters, I feel like I should be playing shotgun.

212
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,020
You want to do a hammer guy or not?

213
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,260
If I can find him, no.

214
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,660
No!

215
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,200
Yeah, he goes next to me!

216
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,580
He goes next to me!

217
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh, it's a motion.

218
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,480
Got motion detected.

219
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,080
They know!

220
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,780
I'm spotted.

221
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,920
They spotted you.

222
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
They're playing slow.

223
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,280
Oh, they're on that side.

224
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,860
They're over there.

225
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,480
One of my motion detectors went off, I think.

226
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,260
I'm going the other way.

227
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,280
I hear one on my left.

228
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,960
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

229
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,320
Two of them.

230
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,860
Oh, wait, on the right over here?

231
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,720
I hear him.

232
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,680
Got him.

233
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,960
Got him.

234
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay, so they were actually...

235
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,620
Okay, so they actually...

236
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,480
They didn't go near us.

237
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:20,620
So, okay.

238
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,140
They actually didn't go to the side.

239
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,840
No, they baited me.

240
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,380
Yeah!

241
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,320
Let's go!

242
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,840
Oh my god.

243
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Why did they push up their defense?

244
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,480
Yeah, they gotta hold the point.

245
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,460
Yeah, what?

246
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,920
Okay, so I have a hammer for defense.

247
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm putting fences.

248
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,740
I'm gonna put fences on this wall.

249
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,220
Wait, I'm point A, you're point B?

250
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,680
Yeah.

251
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,220
I started at point B.

252
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you mean?

253
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,160
I thought it was like a, I thought it was like a, like let him, you know, flip a...

254
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,600
Oh, that's true.

255
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,280
We could flip it.

256
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:46,940
That's true.

257
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,780
Should we do that?

258
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,280
Wait, wait.

259
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,100

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,740
Oh, you tried a corner peek that.

310
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,540

We don't need the producer.

316
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,900
No, we don't need the producer.

317
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,000
We don't need it.

318
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,020

Wait, they sent the TwitchCon people as meat shields.

321
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,320
That messed up.

322
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,180
They're sending them as intel.

323
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,520
They sent them as intel while they camped.

324
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,320
Oh my god, they're both low.

325
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,860
Oh my god, I'm an idiot.

326
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,560
That's what happened.

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,320
Oh, they're both low.

328
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,300

330
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,080
Oh my god.

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,100
We can't get out of here.

332
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,360
Oh my god, we barricaded ourselves so we can't get out.

333
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,300
We gotta get out.

334
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,080
How do we get out?

335
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,660
We lock this.

336
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,400
That's how we did it.

337
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,080
Oh my god.

338
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,780
There's nothing I can do.

339
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,680
I have a shotgun Oh my god.

340
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,780

Oh, I guess they swap.

346
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,300
They want the smoke instead.
