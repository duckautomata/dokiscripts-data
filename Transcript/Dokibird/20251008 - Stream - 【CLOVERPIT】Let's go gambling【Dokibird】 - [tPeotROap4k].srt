You know I'm going to relapse.

Don't understand.

13
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,670
When I see the badge and it makes my serotonin go, whoa, wee, wee, wee, yay.

14
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,470
But like, when I get it, though, when I get it, Right now it's not there.

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,490
But I know when I get it, my brain will be like, yippee, yippee, yippee.

17
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,550
I know it's not there yet.

18
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,250
I can feel it.

19
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,890
I know my brain will be like that when I get it.

20
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,570
It's not.

21
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,070
Okay, so guys, you don't understand.

22
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,850
Guys, I swear.

23
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,350
I don't, I haven't done it in so long.

24
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,470
Just one more fix, chat.

25
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,370
Just one more fix.

26
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,250
So, I was three games off.

27
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,190
I was three games off when I started the grind last night.

28
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,630
Because, like, the day before, I won six games in a row.

29
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,610
And I was like, I got this is it.

30
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,370
This is it.

31
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,350
And then yesterday, I was three games off.

32
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,650
Three.

33
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,610
Today.

34
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,650
I'm six games off.

35
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,330
I'm six games off.

36
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,860
I lost seven games in a row.

37
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,520
When I started yesterday, I was like, I'm three games off.

38
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,010
I'm 500.

39
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:52,070
I'm gonna- And then I lost seven games in a row.

40
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,070
And I deranged two tiers.

41
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,750
I deranged two tiers.

42
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,470
I went from...

43
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,130
I went from...

44
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,890
I went from Celestio 2 to GM 1.

45
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,170
But it's okay.

46
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,530
I'm back to Celestio.

47
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,390
I'm six games off.

48
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,290
I'm...

49
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,170
You know what they say.

50
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,450
99% of gamblers quit before they hit it.

51
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,510
I'm not quitting.

52
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,190
I have two days left.

53
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,670
Guys, no.

54
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,650
This is why I'm like investing so much.

55
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:58,710
two days left guys i have two days left it's possible you don't understand so it's in my reach guys i have two days left and it's in my reach i might be six games off but i i can do i think i can make it i think i'm so so um i may or may not have played rivals for 10 hours straight last night Um,

56
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,810
maybe, maybe 11.

57
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,010
Why were we even gambling?

58
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,190
I was this close, chat.

59
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,570
I was this close to stopping my stream.

60
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,490
I had no rivals.

61
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,970
I knew I knew.

62
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,010
I was like, no, just, no, no, don't.

63
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,990
Don't do it.

64
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,850
You know, they can't handle your rivals, Craig.

65
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,650
Don't.

66
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,870
Don't do it.

67
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,570
Give them the closest thing.

68
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,170
It's so high.

69
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,310
I was like, Clover Pit.

70
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,030
Time.

71
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,790
This is the closest thing to rivals that we can get.

72
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,570
Thank you.

73
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,670
Thank you.

74
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,230
Thank you.

75
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,230
I can't stand this woman.

76
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,170
Hope.

77
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,510

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,990
Thank you.

83
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,430

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,630
Thank you.

86
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,370
This is what?

87
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,530
The fourth last one.

88
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,710
Thank you for the super chat.

89
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,470

91
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,990
I swear to God.

92
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,370

94
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,130
next season, it's a peach and it looks like an ass, but it's not as cool as the dragon.

95
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,370
I know, I was tempted, I was like, maybe I should try again next season so I can get the ass.

96
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,950
But like, because it's literally a peach and it's like shaped like a butt.

97
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:42,930
So I...

98
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,250
But it's not as cool as the dragon!

99
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,830
The dragon is so cool!

100
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,040
No, it's not as cool!

101
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:04,380
I know the dark circles are your skin, so you're fake, but I can feel like I was way worse than you in the super chatting.

102
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,160
No!

103
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,400
The dragon is so...

104
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,740
Okay, guys, guys, I'm not playing Rive.

108
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,020
Like, no, you don't understand.

109
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,200
I need you to understand how cool it looks.

110
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,560

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,500

No, it's much bigger than before, guys.

116
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,580
It's so much bigger than before.

117
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,320

124
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,260
And to be fair, each season is like one month.

125
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,720
But I swear, at least five months.

126
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,960
Oh, that's cool.

127
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,380
The Dragon NFT JPEG has convinced me never.

128
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,980
Thank you for the super chat.

129
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,480
Thank you.

130
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,160
Thank you.

131
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,180
Just got here.

132
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,820
Are we still gambling?

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,240
Chat, thank you for the super chat.

134
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,540
Thank you.

135
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,180
Thank you.

136
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,820
You don't understand.

137
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,720
And that is... Actually, you do understand.

138
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,900
And that is why I went to bed at 10 a.m.

139
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,180
today.

140
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,080
And maybe potentially tomorrow.

141
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,260
That's why we also haven't had our schedule yet.

142
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,580
Because I was like, hmm.

143
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,240
Do I just make it?

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,660
Do I just...

145
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,040
Hmm.

146
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,980
Do I just make it?

147
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,780
All of these rivals.

148
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,540
Guys, I'm six games.

149
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:24,900
it's possible yesterday i might have been three games off but today i'm six games off so that means i'm gonna today today i will be closer maybe i'll secure it today we don't know that's the that's a gamble of it guys it's all about the gamble and 99 of gamblers quit before they hit it big and i ain't no fucking quitter so

150
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,940
This is not worst.

151
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,000
I swear to God.

152
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,520
This is the last time.

153
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,880
So yes, but don't worry.

154
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm okay.

155
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm okay.

156
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,400
Anyway, let's play Clover.

157
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,700
Let's play Clover bit.

158
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,040
All right.

159
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,800
So I've been meaning to play this game for a while.

160
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:57,860
Um, it's basically like rivals, but like less, you can say that it's sort of like rivals.

161
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,700
It gives up the same gambling.

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,960
We can gamble in any language.

167
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,360
Gambling is universal.

168
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,500
All right, let's hope that I can.

169
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,880
It's okay.

170
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Hola.

171
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,040

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,260
Hola.

173
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,380
Where the fuck is the settings?

174
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,200
I can't, it won't let me...

175
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,060
No, it won't let me press escape.

176
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,540
What do you mean?

177
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:28,580

178
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,400
All right, what do you mean?

179
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,920
All right, what does that mean?

180
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,880
Wanted to explain to see Explain to me in Spanish

181
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,800
Okay, all right, cool.

182
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Okay, from contextual, I assume I place my money in the ATM because it says ATM.

183
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,520
I know, at least ATM, no matter where I am, at least ATM is still ATM.

184
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:28,840
If I don't deposit enough money, oh, if I don't deposit enough money, oh, I thought I said the cartel is going to get me.

185
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,100
I thought that's a cartel.

186
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,980
A cantidad.

187
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,280
I thought, I don't know why my brain was like, he's like, a cartel.

188
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,700
A certain quantity.

189
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,500
That's bueno.

190
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,700
I know what bueno is.

191
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,720
Ya vez, que pasa.

192
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,540
I don't know what that is.

193
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,840
Close enough.

194
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,020
Oh, fuck,

196
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,340
I guess it's too much.

197
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
Okay, there's tickets.

198
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,020

Oh, that's a different language, too.

200
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,960
Let's try to put us to decide something, something.

201
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,140
My Oshi is so cultured.

202
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,420
Let's go.

203
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,860

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,120
Thank you.

206
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,400
One tiki.

207
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,140
Tiki.

208
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,200
That's tiki.

209
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,220
Alfa now.

210
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
The con in the final round.

211
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,080
Oh my god.

212
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,500

In the final round.

216
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,440
And then I don't fucking know what he's saying.

217
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,500

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,380

220
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,900
Don't worry.

221
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,220
I figured it out.

222
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,700
Context clues.

223
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,060
Where's the is.

224
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,380

226
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,400

227
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,660

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,100
I was gonna say, now let's, I guess we're playing Korean now.

235
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,420
All right, we're fine.

244
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,120
I still don't know where that ticket goes.

245
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,460
I Listen carefully.

246
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,960
I won't repeat myself Okay, him talking in English is a new thing.

247
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,400
This is where you must deposit the coins you earn.

248
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,080
If you can't deposit enough coins, we're going to get a number of rounds.

249
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,180
Well, you'll find out.

250
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,820
I think we found out.

251
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,240
At the end, you'll earn interest based on your current.

252
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
You keep depositing to earn more.

253
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,180
And you deposit all of that early.

254
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,540
I'll reward you for it.

255
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,220
Oh, that's what it meant.

256
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,020
I was like, I know it's going to get tickets.

257
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,900
But like, how?

258
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,260
That was...

259
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,260
not enough context clues apparently also i bumped the overall sound a bit sound guy

260
00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:14,780
all right you decide how many spins at the end you'll also see one clover ticket even more in certain conditions we're gonna spend your clover tickets to buy lucky charms they improve your odds of survival i know guys i know a lot of you might wanted me to play in spanish but like i don't think it would go very well i could barely read in english let alone the spanish instructions,

261
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,460
all I could really understood was in the final round.

262
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,520
Like final round one.

263
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,620
And bueno.

264
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,160
Yeah.

265
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,520
And that's all I understood reading the Spanish instructions.

266
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,460
Bueno.

267
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,140
And in the final round.

268
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,680
I don't think, and I feel like it's, that's not enough.

269
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,200
Remember to spend your clover tickets to buy lucky charms.

270
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,120
Okay, nice.

271
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,240

272
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,720
Well, I'm done talking.

273
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,900
You won't remember all of it anyway.

274
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,580
All right, let's adjust our settings real quick.

275
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,080
How do I go?

276
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,080
Oh, there it goes.

277
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,420
Oh, I don't want to...

278
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,580
Oh, wait.

279
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,120
Uh, we'll go this way here.

280
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Back.

281
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,900
What the fuck there is?

282
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,820
Alright, whoa.

283
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,160
Okay, that sense is way too high.

284
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,080
Why is the sense so goddamn high?

285
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,000
Jesus Christ.

286
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,580

289
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:59,340

There's the risk factor of him potentially murdering me.

368
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:06,910

How about another deadline?

387
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,740
You now need to earn the amount.

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,540
$200.

389
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,580

390
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:15,940
Oh.

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,500
Okay, never mind.

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,780

399
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,360
That's right.

400
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,020
I found my poor leaf Clover.

401
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,280
Don't worry.

402
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,780

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,060
I'll be like, I swear to God, it's just one day.

407
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,820
It's just, it's just one day.

408
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,140
Be okay.

409
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,840
Okay, it's now plus 14.

410
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,040
Just a quick one day relapse, and then I'll go back.

411
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll go back to rehab.

412
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,180
I'll go back.

413
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,480
Just one, I can stop at any time I want.

414
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,080
Oh, plus seven.

415
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,060
Oh, got my peppers.

416
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,220
Yes, I did.

417
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,580
I got a minute to rehab.

418
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,160
And then you can, you know, you can, oh, hey, there's a voicemail.

419
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,140
This is all, oh, oh, that's a voicemail.

420
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,640
And then, like, you know, you can leave at any time you want in rehab.

421
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,280
Because, like, technically they can't, like, keep you there.

422
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,980
So then I left after I got in.

423
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,540
And then I was, you know what?

424
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,800
I don't need this.

425
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,660
And then I left.

426
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,440

431
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,680

Like, you know, you have to lose to win, you know?

439
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,660
That's how it goes.

440
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,620
You gotta lose.

441
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,360
to win.

442
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,920
All right, we got the clover, and then that's how it goes.

443
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,520
Sometimes you just gotta lose to win.

444
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,720
Wait, I have it enough for 200, anyway.

445

00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,160

515
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,880
But I said never punished.

516
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,260
I don't understand.

517
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,860
And then I get punished?

518
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,720
I don't understand.

519
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,800
If I say never punished, doesn't it mean I don't get punished?

520
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,820
Oh no.

521
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,620
Oh this is bad.

522
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,020
This is bad.

523
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,080
Oh no.

524
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,420
Oh no.

525
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,900
I need it.

526
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,700
I need it.

527
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,100
I need to calm down real quick.

528
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,020
Oh,

529
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,280
shit.

530
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,040
I got pee.

531
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,880
Wait, I've jarred my pee.

532
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,140
What do I do with it?

533
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,200
During all patterns with yellow will trigger and this.

534
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,660
Oh, wait.

535
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,520
Does that mean there's something if I do a little poop?

536
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,560
Just a little poop?

537
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,180
There's somewhere there's a valuable lesson to learn here.

538
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,660
Wait, I don't understand.

539
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,980
Is this RNG?

540
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,500
How unlucky am I to get the sixth?

541
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,220
Wait, does this always happen in round three or is it just me?

542
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,080
Or is this just dokey things?

543
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,380
Is this... Is this... Oh, very unlucky.

544
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,820
Oh, my God.

545
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,180
Okay, it's just... Just dokey things.

546
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:49,620
Okay.

547
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,180
Okay, that's good to know.

548
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,000
It's just... Just some silly dokey things.

549
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,940
Oh, yeah, lucky, lucky, lucky.

550
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,460
It says 1.5 chance.

551
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,040
That is not 1.5.

552
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,180
Okay.

553
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,200
Okay, nice cherries.

554
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,800
I need all I can get.

555
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,260
Oh my god, please.

556
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,560
Don't do this to me.

557
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,060
Okay, I don't see a 6.

558
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,060

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,640

Oh, guys, guys.

00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm a little worried.

580
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,560
I'm a little worried right now.

581
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,100
Just a little bit.

582
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,780
Oh, my God.

583
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
My last spin.

00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,580

585
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,940

586
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,600
Oh, no.

587
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,300
My sponsor Wardview.

588
00:39:59,500 --> 00:39:59,720
It's okay.

589
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,440
It's okay.

590
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,140
Guys, it's okay.

591
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,380
If I please, please.

592
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,320
I swear I can do it.

593
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,000
I can swear.

594
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,300
I can I can try.

595
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,340
I can do the money.

596
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,340
I can't get down!

597
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,180
Are you in control?

598
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,760
Yes, I am.

599
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,100
I am in control of my life.

600
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,220
Look, I've learned a valuable lesson today.

601
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,800
And that is that you never stop gambling.

602
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,300
If you quit, you quit before you hit it big, guys.

603
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,320
I learned a very valid...

604
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,040
It's because they forced me to quit.

605
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,300
And that's...

606
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,760
If I had one more spin, I would have made it.

607
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,400
That's right.

608
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,200
Let's go gambling.

609
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,620
I learned a lesson today.

610
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,640
And that's that I quit too soon.

611
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,560
And I should have committed.

612
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,580
I should have committed to it.

613
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,740

Now that I'm old, this is the only rush I'll get.

00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,180
They can get their own money.

623
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,640
They don't need my inheritance.

624
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,340

It's okay.

650
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:28,230
God gives their toughest warriors the biggest challenges.

651
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,230
This is just a test from above.

652
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,230

656
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,880
Look at that fucking giant I can keep spinning.

657
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,300
I have four spins.

658
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:29,400
All right.

659
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,220
Let's go gambling.

660
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh my god.

661
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,840
Another jack.

662
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,180
I told you, bro.

663
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,320
I told you, bro.

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,960

667
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,880
But, guys, guys, I can be even richer.

668
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,220
Guys, I can make even more.

669
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,020
This is like an unlimited money glitch right here, an infinite money glitch.

670
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,100
Oh, my God.

671
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,340
If I just keep spinning, I keep earning money.

672
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,880
Because the more spins you do, More chances that you would earn more.

673
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,160
Oh, three in a row.

674
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,300
Three in a fucking row.

675
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,520
You are so in.

676
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,100
You win more than you lose.

677
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,760
Guys, I told you.

678
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,280
You win more than you lose.

679
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,940
This is only the second round.

680
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,540
Oh my god.

681
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,540

01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:56,510
Oh, please.

858
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,230
I don't want to spin anymore.

859
01:00:58,670 --> 01:00:59,230
I'm okay.

860
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,170
I don't need a spin anymore.

861
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,850
Don't you just do it.

862
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:05,810
It's okay.

863
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:06,590
We're fine.

864
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:08,830
All right, that's enough.

865
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,180
Okay.

866
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,800
And then...

867
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,280
All right.

868
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,660
We can do one more spin.

869
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,240
Fuck it.

870
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,780
We don't need tickets.

871
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,820
But we're going to the moon!

872
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,220
Alright, let's go.

873
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,760
To the moon we go.

874
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,220
Buried me next to a casino so my ghost can gamble even when...

875
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,340
No, buried me... Spread my ashes on the...

876
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,700
on the slot machine.

877
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,880
so I can feel the gambler.

878
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,280
Oh my god, let's fucking go.

879
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,100
Yay!

880
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,100

882
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,820
Pause it.

883
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,240
I got a draw!

884
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,720
Yippee!

885
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:17,520
See?

886
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,780

889
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,180
Many thank you, the super chat.

890
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,380
Thank you, thank you.

891
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,260
One or two?

892
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,560
Oh, but then like we go all in on the seven.

893
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,500
But bro, what if I'm going all in?

894
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,880
I'm going.

895
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,900
You ever heard of sunk cost fallacy?

896
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,060
Yeah, but it won't happen to me.

897
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:50,980
You don't understand.

898
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,120
That ain't gonna happen to me, though.

899
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,640
Okay, what should I get?

900
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,500
The shrooms, right?

901
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:02,770
This one, right?

902
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,370
Uh, when you see at least one...

903
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,390
Which one do we get?

904
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,380
Shrooms?

905
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,560
Alright, shroom time.

906
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,240
Alright, we don't need a re-roll shop.

907
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,640
We go all...

908
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,140
Wait, how much is the gamba?

909
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,280
Oh, it's not that much.

910
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,020
Okay, I'll deposit some money then.

911
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,160
All right.

912
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,380
Let's go gambling.

913
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,380
All right.

914
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:35,940
That's fine.

915
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,180
Plus 24.

916
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:44,460
Come on.

917
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,960
Where's my lucky seven?

918
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,400
Come on, guys.

919
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,440

920
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,460
Oh, a thousand mama like you.

Oh, one six.

923
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,360
That's okay.

924
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:02,940
It's just one.

925
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,860
Plus 54.

926
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:07,800
It's okay.

927
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,180

01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,480

There we go.

Look at that.

931
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,560
With the power of the button.

932
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,500
And the lucky.

933
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,820

I got everything I need.

947
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,570
A toilet and a stop machine.

948
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,290
That's everything, right?

949
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:48,770
That's all you need.

950
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:51,230
And I guess water and food, I guess.

951
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:53,730
Okay, look.

952
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,770
I know this doesn't look ideal, okay?

953
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:57,170
I know that...

954
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:58,290
Um...

955
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,930

I got everything I need it right here.

958
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:16,150
Look, if I never have to meet anybody, why would I ever need it?

959
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:25,270
Basic hygiene is just for other people.

960
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,430
It's just for appearances.

961
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,690
Oh, Mushy Mushy.

962
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,090
Triggered by double the value of Clover.

963
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:41,590
Add the obsessive trait to a random lucky.

964
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:45,750
If I keep trying, the patterns will align.

965
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,190
Two?

966
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,790
I feel like I should double it, right?

967
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,430
Or three.

968
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,590
I don't even know what three...

969
01:08:58,590 --> 01:08:59,950
What does the obsessive trait do?

970
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:37,380
what does the obsessive trait even do three is great all right we'll try it i don't know what it does but stop projecting your ideas into reality look bro you don't understand bro i'm not projecting bro i'm i swear i'm gonna be a millionaire bro and you're gonna regret it you're gonna regret it for not believing in me bro okay what's this pattern with non-yellow oh hey there's another pepper buy anything.

971
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,780
Oh, it's my money!

972
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,240
Oh, my God.

973
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,100
It's the money that triggers it, too.

974
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,180
Wait, that is so good.

975
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,720
That's actually so good.

976
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:47,920
Stonks?

977
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:48,720
Plus... Oh, wait.

978
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,860
I don't need that, actually.

979
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,140
I'm actually going to pause it.

980
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:51,740
3,000?

981
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,560
Alright.

982
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:56,220
Uh...

983
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,300
I don't have anything.

984
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:58,960
Is there anything?

985
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,380
Oh, I can buy this, right?

986
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:00,880
No.

987
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,060
Oh, I can't buy anything.

988
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,960
I feel like I'm...

989
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,260
It's already so good, though.

990
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,540
Yeah, I think that is actually the best, the best charm I can get it on.

991
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,720
All right, it's fine.

992
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:19,980
It's fine.

993
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,040
I don't even, I didn't even win anything.

994
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,620
Again, let's go.

995
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,640
And again, and again, and again.

996
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,540
Oh my god, it's teasing me.

997
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,420
That little six is just like, oh, what if we just get it?

998
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:38,060
It's actually, it's actually like, oh, but what if?

999
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:44,400
But what if we just get it right now?

1000
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,280
Oh, that's really silly.

1001
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,740
I was like, oh, you, you little silly guy.

1002
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,260
You're so silly.

1003
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,160
Good back, T's.

1004
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,420
You're such a tease.

1005
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,720
Oh, my God.

1006
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,380
Oh, you thought we were going to give him another 60, didn't you?

1007
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,580
I'm so silly.

1008
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,300
You're so silly.

1009
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,960
Alright, nice.

1010
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:17,980
Yay!

1011
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,900
Two rounds left.

1012
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,640
Alright, I'm just...

1013
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,420
There's just a silly little bird.

1014
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,580
I mean...

1015
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,440
Should be okay now.

1016
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,280
Alright.

1017
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:44,340
Dump shrooms by stonks?

1018
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,760
What a little tease.

1019
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,380
That little six guy.

1020
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:55,660
I like how the first time I got six, I got it like twice in a row.

1021
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,560
Now they're just like, oh, just...

1022
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,540
Remember that time when you got six, six, six?

1023
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,900
Oh, oh, oh.

1024
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,520
Remember that?

1025
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,880
That was so funny, wasn't it?

1026
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,500
After dropping a jackpot, damn, I know.

1027
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:17,980
That's the worst part.

1028
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,700
After I got the jackpot.

1029
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,420
PTSD trigger right there.

1030
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,300
But, um, but um, but um, but um, but um, but um, but um, but um.

1031
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,380
All right.

1032
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:42,840
I literally have enough right now for, uh, I have, Wait, is that 3,330?

1033
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,820
Is that it?

1034
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,000
Oh, wait, that is the exact amount.

1035
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,680
All right, we'll just keep spinning.

1036
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,680
I said one more round.

1037
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,960
It gave me hope just to take it away.

1038
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:58,660
It's okay.

1039
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,140
My thing will trigger eventually.

1040
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,400
And again, and again!

1041
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,300

01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,540

Oh, my God.

1055
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,160
It's getting crazier.

1056
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,480
Diamonds manifest more often.

1057
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:00,540
I found...

1058
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,780

1059
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,640
Wait, what do we want?

01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:46,080
Alright.

1067
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,100
Bye, train.

1068
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,300
We're gonna destroy you.

01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,940
And then we'll put...

1070
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,580
We'll put you in the drawer.

1071
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:54,180
And then what do we get?

1072
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,100
The lucky seven or the Bible?

1073
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:58,320
Guys.

1074
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,020
Do we get the...

1075
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,460
Train or the...

1076
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,200
Do we get the seven or the Bible?

1077
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,360
I can't get both.

1078
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,420
Oh my god, they're both so good.

1079
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:14,500
Seven?

1080
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:14,980
Alright.

1081
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,320
We'll grab the seven.

1082
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:18,540
Okay.

1083
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,620
We'll do that on the last spin, too.

1084
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,380
Alright, this is it.

1085
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,780
Let's go gabbing!

1086
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,200
Okay.

1087
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,780
Yeah, I have the seven buff.

1088
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,260
You're right.

1089
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:40,980
Yeah!

1090
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,440
For thousand!

1091
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,320
Okay, five.

1092
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,240
Why didn't right away?

1093
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,080
Oh shit, okay.

1094
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,540
I didn't realize I needed right away.

1095
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:55,760
Come on.

1096
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,000
Come on.

1097
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,140
It says more sevens.

1098
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:58,960
Why is there two?

1099
01:16:59,660 --> 01:16:59,880
What?

1100
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,040
Why is there only two?

1101
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,920
I want to spin.

1102
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,880
Okay, I already put that.

1103
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:14,830
They're like, do more sevens?

1104
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,090
What about two sevens?

1105
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:23,690
Like, see, now they have three.

1106
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:29,550
Oh, my God, 25.3% chance for a seven.

1107
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:37,710
Wow, I have more of a chance to get a seven than any other set, but it still gave me two sevens.

1108
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:39,030
That's fucked up.

1109
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:43,050
It still gave me two sevens, but technically I should get more.

1110
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,010
That's what I'm saying

1111
01:17:52,550 --> 01:18:35,530

1112
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:44,990
It's at next Tuesday.

1113
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,710
The other six got lost.

1114
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,850
His GPS wasn't working.

1115
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:54,030
Oh, no.

1116
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:54,990
Oh, no.

1117
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:57,090
I have two more spins.

1118
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,310
That's way too many spins.

1119
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:02,810
Oh, oh my god.

1120
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:03,570
He's like, bro!

1121
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,730
Why are you still not here?

1122
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,910
It's always the last six.

1123
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:10,650
Today?

1124
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:11,910
You mean today?

1125
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:12,390
Today?

1126
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,630
You got V for a specific...

1127
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:18,390
Yo, we got a Google Calendar for a reason, bro.

1128
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,570
You're the one that didn't put it on the Google Calendar.

1129
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,390
All right, we made it.

1130
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:26,990
The third six-point home.

1131
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:32,190
The one guy that flicks out every time.

1132
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:34,190
Let's go.

1133
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,190
Can't believe it.

1134
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:38,030
That's how you said tomorrow, bro.

1135
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,930
But on, but on, but on.

1136
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:54,610
13 000 jesus christ this is always because it's a build-up every time i thought it resets

1137
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:18,820
oh my god it's getting too close for my liking oh my god 14 oh no no oh thank god he still did right he overslept again thank you guys like oh i'm sorry You, but you didn't read my text message, man.

1138
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,480
I was confused.

1139
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,360
They're like, guys, I think we gotta check on the third.

1140
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,680
I think he's dead.

1141
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:34,660
He hasn't replied to the text chain in, like, a week.

1142
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,180
And I think he might be, like, dead or...

1143
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,040
Oh, there he is!

1144
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,660
He's like, hey, guys.

1145
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,460
Like, just got...

1146
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:41,400
Where did they go?

1147
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,760
Checked.

1148
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:43,540
They're not...

1149
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,980
It's like, hey guys, I'm here.

1150
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,940
I'm here for the spin.

1151
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,760
Oh, there he is.

1152
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,640
He finally showed up.

1153
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,200
Nice.

1154
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,080
Where is everyone?

1155
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,740
He got the wrong date again.

1156
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:08,660
Late by three business days.

1157
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,180
Oh my god.

1158
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,240
Oh my god.

1159
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,040
I don't want any more spin.

1160
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:40,930
Let's go, actually, JK, JK, oh my god, another test, I don't want, this is, oh, this is too good to be training, I don't want, at least I'm okay, I don't want any more spins, oh, thank god, oh thank god, I got really scared, I, more, did someone say, more spins,

1161
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:52,550
oh my god, so, I'm so nervous every time, Every time there's too many spins.

1162
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,930
The whole board.

1163
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:02,470
Lucky charms are discounted.

1164
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:05,050
Double the value of diamond and treasure.

1165
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:09,030
Should every roll chat win it?

1166
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,630
But wait, there's more!

1167
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:15,510
Uh...

1168
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,550
Three roll?

1169
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:19,310
Okay.

1170
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,570
This time I'm betting on yellow.

1171
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,790
Add the- what's the avid trait?

1172
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:36,150
Two?

1173
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,570
Or three?

1174
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:39,810
I already have the obsessive trait last time.

1175
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:41,390
Two or three?

1176
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,290
Which is better?

1177
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:44,430
It's like split.

1178
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,170
I might have another charm with the obsessive.

1179
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:47,830
Fuck it.

1180
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,210
Three is better.

1181
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:49,790
Alright.

1182
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,470
Let's see which one got it.

1183
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:54,930
Which one got the obsessive?

1184
01:22:55,250 --> 01:23:41,350

Stonks or seven?

1188
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,650
Are we betting on sevens?

1189
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:23,530
Seven or...

1190
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:24,510
Oh my god.

1191
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,030
Plus 5% to your interest.

1192
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:29,070
Let's do it.

1193
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,490
All in on seven.

1194
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:33,330
We're lucky number seven.

1195
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,430
All right, here we go.

1196
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:35,250

01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,930
Okay, I can deposit another 50.

1202
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:42,670
Okay.

1203
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:46,290
Oh, okay, this is...

1204
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:47,590
Okay.

1205
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:54,630
Wait, my thing.

1206
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:01,810
Wait, why didn't...

1207
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:03,630
Why is it not triggering?

1208
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,390
Wait, why is it not triggering?

1209
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,930
Oh, no battery?

1210
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,730
It needs a recharge!

1211
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:11,790
I'll...

1212
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:14,470
You recharge, but I tell you to recharge!

1213
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,910
Alright.

1214
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,740
Okay, 21,000.

1215
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:29,040
Oh, I need, like, 100k for a fucking win or some shit.

1216
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:30,880
Okay, 21.

1217
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,700
Oh, two more.

1218
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,820
Oh, my God.

1219
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,940
Oh, the sevens were so close to each other!

1220
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,800
Oh, now they're all not...

1221
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,860
All of them are not coordinating with each other.

1222
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,640
They're all lost.

1223
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:50,980
Nice.

1224
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,760
21k.

1225
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,440
Last roll.

1226
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:56,480
No!

1227
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,880
No!

1228
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,640
Let's roll!

1229
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,240
Tell me.

1230
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,540
It's over.

1231
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,180
The run's over.

1232
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,380
It's so...

1233
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,660
It's so over.

1234
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,360
No!

1235
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:26,480
They finally coordinated with the group chat!

1236
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:30,020
My 84k!

1237
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,560
They finally figured it out.

1238
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,940
Oh my gosh.

1239
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,880
They finally found this.

1240
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,140
They finally used the Google Calendar.

1241
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:49,780
They finally figured out how to use the Google Calendar chat.

1242
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,500
Oh my god, this spin is so unlucky.

1243
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,400
This is actually a very unlucky spin.

1244
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:57,960
Oh!

1245
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,680
Golden cat!

1246
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:03,460
Okay.

1247
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,020
I have one more spin.

1248
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:09,500
Come on.

1249
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,860
Oh my god.

1250
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,720
I want 21% chance for sevens.

1251
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,660
But yeah, all I get are cherries.

1252
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,880
I don't understand.

1253
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,660
Oh, please don't do this to me.

1254
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:19,920
Please.

1255
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:20,260
Oh!

1256
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,100
Oh, my world for us!

1257
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:22,820
Yes!

1258
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,180
Golden sevens!

1259
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,920
Yes!

1260
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:29,200
Oh, and again, and again, and again!

1261
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,320
Oh, my God.

1262
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,320
Let's fucking go.

1263
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,440
23k.

1264
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:34,680
Alright.

1265
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:36,780
Oh.

1266
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,180
I don't know if I'll make it, though.

1267
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,580
This is cutting it real close.

1268
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,820
I have one roll left.

1269
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,460
Oh.

1270
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:50,580

01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,400

But they treated me so well, guys.

1275
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:07,580
I can't.

1276
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,140
It wants me to deposit.

1277
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,100
Oh, I can.

1278
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:14,720
Oh.

1279
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,680
Stonks can save me.

1280
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,640
But the shrooms have saved me so much.

01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:13,630
Guys, I have a feeling that the 7 build was not the most ideal build I could have done.

1346
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:23,710
I'm not quite sure why yet, but like, it's just a little feeling that I have that maybe the 7 build might have been the most stupidest thing I've done.

1347
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:27,610
Just maybe.

1348
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:29,610
I'm not too sure yet.

1349
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:38,510
Chat will never lead me astray.

1350
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:39,650
Yay!

01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,410

It must be funny.

1353
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:48,810
In a rich man's world.

1354
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,070
Alright.

1355
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:54,150

1382
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:18,750
That was old dokey.

1383
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:19,290
The dokey.

1384
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:20,230
That was old dokey.

1385
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:21,750
I'm the new and improved dokey.

1386
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:23,750
With a bigger gambling addiction.

1387
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:24,830
That's my improvement.

1388
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:28,150
Oh.

1389
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:31,050
Oh wait, no, we don't need that.

1390
01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:33,550
Wait, shrooms?

1391
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:35,330
Okay, oh my god, they're all so good.

1392
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:36,950
Guys, we can't do the seven again.

1393
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:38,770
That one actually fucked us over.

1394
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,290
Guys, we can't do the seven again, guys.

1395
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:46,090
That actually messed us up.

1396
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:48,750
Alright, we'll do shrooms.

1397
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:53,510
How much is per gamble?

1398
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:55,250
Okay, I can plus 10 more.

1399
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:56,230
Alright.

1400
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:00,630
Troon gang.

1401
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:06,570
If we can't, if we get the money early, we'll deposit it early.

1402
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:09,770
God, the cat food was so good to us.

1403
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:13,090
Like, we actually, it clutched so hard.

1404
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,300
Oh my god, this is not a lucky...

1405
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,720
Oh, unless...

1406
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,900
Oh, the plus five?

1407
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,440
Oh, plus seven?

1408
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,040
We're teed?

1409
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,800

1410
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,400
Oh, there we are.

1411
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,580
That's what I like to see.

1412
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,660
See milaki!

1413
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:35,240
Milaki drinks for everyone at the bar!

1414
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,140
Okay.

1415
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:42,210
Alright, nice.

1416
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:45,370
But like, uh, okay, we'll do all of it.

1417
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:46,890
Yeah!

1418
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:47,390
Oh.

1419
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:49,390
Oh.

1420
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:50,490
Oh.

1421
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:51,710
Oh.

1422
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:55,150
Oh no, the Bible's gone.

1423
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:57,430
Oh no, the Bible's gone.

1424
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:58,490
I forgot it.

1425
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:03,220
Oh, the Bible's gone!

1426
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,820
Why the fuck would you have the base chances to manifest this?

1427
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:17,060
Oh, I guess if you don't have these as your thing.

1428
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,260
I forgot about the Bible.

1429
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,280
I forgot about the Bible.

1430
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:24,740
Oh, wait.

1431
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:25,420
We don't...

1432
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,460
It's not that...

1433
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,140
Wait.

1434
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:28,940
Try double it.

1435
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,580
I have the base chances to manifest closer.

1436
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:33,940

Okay, clover and belt.

Wait, what do we want?

1443
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,840
We want a clicker?

1444
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:24,200
A little bro is a goat.

1445
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:29,320
We can get both of these.

1446
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,280
Okay, we'll grab this and this.

1447
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:38,360
Okay, the 666er is back, so...

Oh, that's fine.

1449

I already got it.

1450
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:45,220
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,040
Where is it?

1454
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:50,760
Come on.

1455
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,880
Come on, little guy.

1456
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,980
Don't be shy.

1457
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:54,960
Come back.

1458
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,500
I don't know what build we're doing.

1459
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,720
There's a build.

1460
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,320
My seven build didn't work for some reason.

1461
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,100
I don't understand.

1462
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,000
Click, click, click, click.

1463
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:14,460
All right.

1464
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,760
The pepper tab.

1465
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:19,540
Nice.

1466
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,020
Oh my god, 6-7.

1467
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:26,880
Oh shit, that's scary.

1468
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:30,840
All right.

1469
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:36,240
No, no, no, no.

1470
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,400
I mean, technically I can re-road this.

1471
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,040
I don't really need it.

1472
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:46,900
Cease.

1473
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,520
I mean, a lot of cherries.

1474
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,100
You know what?

1475
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:51,580
Fuck it.

1476
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,520
Let's grab it all.

1477
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,180
It's my little collection.

1478
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:57,320
Well, how much is that, bro?

1479
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:57,940

1480
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:58,880
Okay, I can put more.

1481
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:04,320
Alright.

1482
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:10,790
Put on, put on.

1483
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:12,390
My pepper.

1484
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:13,710

Oh, please no, Peppa, please, please, no, 666, please, please.

1491
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:35,190
I got a jackpot, please don't do this to me.

1492
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:37,630
Imagine a casino actually had that, you know?

1493
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:42,590
They had the, they have the fucking 666 feature.

1494
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:51,310
Oh, I like me some Irish luck.

1495
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,070
All right, nice.

1496
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,190
One round left.

1497
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:59,230
Oh, I made it.

1498
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:02,550
All right, throw it out.

1499
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,950
Fuck it.

1500
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,080
Is any of these good?

1501
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:10,140
The Scar.

1502
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:16,710
Oh, I don't have any of that shit.

1503
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:23,300
You get the Pentagon?

1504
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,260
A pentacle?

1505
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:26,100
Alright.

1506
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:27,460
Fuck it.

1507
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,100
I don't even know what this does.

1508
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,800
Goes by one whenever...

1509
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,240
Oh!

1510
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,100
Oh, okay.

1511
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:37,960
That's cool.

1512
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:43,300
Grab it early.

1513
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:44,160
Fuck it.

1514
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:45,780
Grab some more tickets.

1515
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:50,940
I don't have a lot of tickets anyway.

1516
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,160
You know what?

1517
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:53,600
Fuck it.

1518
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,400
Let's do it early.

1519
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,860
Get that shit out of here.

1520
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,380
Wait, how many spins do I have?

1521
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:00,680
Oh, one round.

1522
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,460
You know what?

1523
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:03,660
Finally, let's get some tickets.

1524
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,500
Go next.

1525
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,420
GG, go next.

1526
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,240
Oh, it was just four?

1527
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:10,620
I thought I'd get more.

1528
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,700
And the ambitious trait.

1529
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:16,940
Get rid of that cherry picture?

1530
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:18,260
Okay, I'll get rid of it.

1531
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:26,470
Increase the value of pattern.

1532
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:26,870
Three?

1533
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:27,810
Two or three?

1534
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:36,670
I like how there's one guy that's spamming three and be like, If I keep spamming, she'll think she she won't get one guide and she

1535
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,350
She won't know she'll get one guide

1536
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:54,690
Two and three no one multiple guide nice catch

1537
01:42:57,790 --> 01:43:02,710
I'll do three then we'll see Which one did I give it to?

1538
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:05,070

01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:47,390

1563
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:51,430

1564

1565
01:44:58,570 --> 01:45:00,630

01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:02,350

01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,150

1583
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:02,850
Alright, last spin.

1584
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:05,030

1586
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:07,370
Cherries again!

1587
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:14,940
Alright.

01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:17,620

01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,480

1590
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:20,820
One pepper.

1591
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:22,840

1592
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,420

01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,880
I mean, I'm halfway there.

1594
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:32,420
Halfway there.

1595
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:32,920
Ooh.

1596
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,880
Living on a prayer.

1597
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:37,880
All right.

1598
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,400

1599
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,700
I have so much cherries.

1600
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:45,540

01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:30,660
Where's my plus one restock of the Bible?

1605

01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:37,460
I was done.

1608
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:43,400
Okay, let's get rid of...

1609
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:44,480

What happened to homies for life?

1613
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,860
You thought you'd know someone, you know?

1614
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,300
You think you know someone.

1615
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:35,340
But you don't.

1616
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:36,580
You don't know them.

1617
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:44,200
Alright, it's for the treasure build.

1618
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:46,240
Alright, we'll throw the sphere away.

1619
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:49,000
Personal trainer is good.

1620
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,300
How good is it?

1621
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,260
Not well.

1622
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:53,780

1623
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:00,550
I don't understand.

1624
01:50:00,650 --> 01:50:02,010
Now I get zero cherries.

1625
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,610
It's just all treasure.

1626
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:12,250
Alright.

1627
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:16,370
It's like, oops, all treasure.

1628
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:23,270
Person, for the Reposition Mod, by decreased by...

1629

1630
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,950
Oh no.

1631
01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:34,070
Take my college.

1632
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:36,830
You're my favorite gambling at addicted me.

1633
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:38,650
That's not an addiction.

1634
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,830
It's a lifestyle.

1635
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:43,850
That's pretty good.

1636
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:45,130
Thank you for the super chat.

1637
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:45,530
Thank you.

1638
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:46,230
Thank you.

1639
01:50:46,490 --> 01:50:47,590
What do I get rid of?

1640
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,170
All my shit is good, though.

1641
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:50,110
Do we get rid of this?

1642
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:52,330
I feel like we don't...

1643
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:54,630
I feel like we got a lot of treasures, though.

1644
01:50:58,700 --> 01:50:59,620
I don't know.

1645
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,300
Do we get rid of this or...

1646
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:02,860
And get the personal trainer?

1647
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,560
I feel like they're all pretty good.

1648
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:09,880
It's a light.

1649
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,000
It's a dedication.

1650
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:12,460
It's a hobby.

1651
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:15,340
Draw the orb.

1652
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:17,020
What's in my... What is that?

1653
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:18,540
Oh, wait.

1654
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,400
Do I have... Oh, I don't have anything in there.

1655
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:24,020
I'll draw it.

1656
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:25,620
And then I'll grab the personal trainer.

1657
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:28,860
Alright.

1658
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:33,040
Let's go gambling.

1659
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:35,840
Oh, thank God.

1660
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,020
Thank God number three.

1661
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,040
is not reliable.

1662
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:43,300
Jesus Christ.

1663
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:44,840
That's what I like to see.

1664
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:51,980
I'm not making it.

1665
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,880
My last run was so good.

1666
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,600
My last run was actually perfect.

1667
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:00,580
Oh, thank God.

1668
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:01,900
He just didn't show up.

1669
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:04,000
He's like, maybe he's just one hour late, guys.

1670
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,340
But he just never showed up.

1671
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:11,100
Nice.

1672
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:12,260
Lucky cat, 3,000.

1673
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:13,500
Oh, I made it.

1674
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:16,300
Oh, oh, diamond.

1675
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,060
Here we go.

1676
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:18,760
And again, 2,000.

1677
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,000
Oh, wait.

1678
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,020
I got another lucky spin.

1679
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:23,020
Oh, the more diamonds.

1680
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:25,020
Get them, girl, some diamonds.

1681
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:29,620
Oh, my God.

1682
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:30,520
This is a lot.

1683
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:32,660
Oh, and the lucky.

1684
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:34,440
Oh, wait.

1685
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,800
I just made everything back.

1686
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,000
Oh, look, diamonds.

1687
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:39,300
Look at that.

1688
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:42,720
some diamonds here.

1689
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:45,960
Alright, we'll wait here.

1690
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:46,580
Alright.

1691
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:48,520
I think we can.

1692
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:49,420
One more row.

1693
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:51,160
I mean, we made it.

1694
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:54,020
This is just... This is just for the fun of it.

1695
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:55,980
This is the passion part.

1696
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,860
Where the lemon cherry been?

1697
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:03,820
Oh my god, I got a new item.

1698
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,340
A girl's best friend.

1699
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,880
I'm just doing it for the passion already.

1700
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:11,260
already.

1701
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:13,660
Those sixes don't scare me.

1702
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,660
I know the third guy is unreliable.

1703
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,160
He doesn't look at the group chat.

1704
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,320
I ain't scared.

1705
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:25,960
Nice.

1706
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:29,440
It's just a side hustle at that point.

1707
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:34,040
Yeah.

1708
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36,240
Yeah!

1709
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,500
33.

1710
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,380
I'm practically almost there.

1711
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,280
Yeah.

1712
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:44,880
I'm almost there already.

1713
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:47,360
Double the value.

1714
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:48,380
Increase the charms.

1715
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:49,060
Oh, wait.

1716
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:49,720
We should get two.

1717
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:51,180
I'm waiting two.

1718
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,670
I need more and more charms.

1719
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:59,310
I'm so hungry.

1720
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:02,330
So hungry.

1721
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:10,210
Every last pattern triggers one more time.

1722
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,350
Wait, we should get stonks.

1723
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:13,190
Stonks go up.

1724
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:16,970
Oh, wait.

1725
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:19,290
We practically make it.

1726
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,510
Alright, let's just...

1727
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:24,530
Does that go all the way?

1728
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:26,310
I don't know, I can't count.

1729
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:30,530
Oh, I'm so hungry.

1730
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:33,330
I already made it.

1731
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:35,650
So this is just for the fun of it.

1732
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:39,050
Yay!

1733
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:43,890
We spin, spin, spin.

1734
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:45,290

That's right.

1758
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:33,910
The third stick is a dirty cop.

1759
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:40,570
Nothing bad ever happens to Kennedys.

1760
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:44,070
Wait, how many rounds?

1761
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:46,070

Alright.

1778
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:50,650
We have another spin.

1779
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:56,410
I can't believe I got the ultimate jackpot.

1780
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:57,950
That was crazy.

1781
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:00,110
I didn't even know numbers can go that high.

1782
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:08,230
Keep gambling.

1783
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:10,050
Gotta keep gambling.

It keeps going up.

1788
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:21,790
It will always go up.

1789
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:23,690
It'll never stop going up.

1790
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:27,090
It'll keep going up and up and up.

1791
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:29,570
Oh, oh, goodbye personal trader.

1792
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:32,570
We had a hard attack.

1793
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:36,030
Alright.

1794
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:39,850
Is there anything I can buy here that's worth it or not?

1795
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:41,550
Nah, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.

1796
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:43,010
We'll just put it all in.

1797
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:44,830
Yay!

1798
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:46,810

1803
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:59,660

Okay.

1815
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:53,640
We should grab that then.

1816
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:56,140
You know what?

1817
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:57,500
I have so much money.

1818
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:06,910
Yeah, let's fuck it.

1819
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:07,370
Let's go.

1820
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:11,170
Uh...

1821
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:13,450
Like, we practically made it.

1822
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:16,210
Diamond photo?

1823
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:18,590
Oh, shit, you're right, I didn't even see it.

1824
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:21,690
I don't know what to get rid of.

1825
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:24,610
Everything's been so good to me, sir.

1826
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:29,270
Everything has been so good to me.

1827
02:00:32,450 --> 02:00:34,430
It's like, what can I get rid of?

1828
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,000
Nah, everything has been good to me.

1829
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:43,880
to me so far.

1830
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,720
I feel like I use the clicker a lot.

1831
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:51,880
Do I have anything here?

1832
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:58,980
I don't need treasure photo for my build.

1833
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:01,260
Okay, let's do this first.

1834
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:03,420
And then what?

1835
02:01:07,570 --> 02:01:10,230
Oh, this one wasn't a good spin.

1836
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:12,270
Maybe it's the last spin.

1837
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:17,870
It's the last spin that matters the most.

1838
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:44,170
Okay, for the mushrooms, all right, uh, all right, let's grab the diamond, not screws, you take those lemons and you squeeze them back into life, guys, I think it was Richard Warren, thank you, thank you, thank you, when I get, when I get extra, I go,

Do we get the diamond?

1842
02:01:54,590 --> 02:01:55,610
Is it worth it?

1843
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:57,710
Is this worth it?

1844
02:01:58,750 --> 02:01:59,690
Or is this spear?

1845
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:00,970
Oh, wait.

1846
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:02,150
Diamond and treasure.

1847
02:02:02,310 --> 02:02:02,550
Wait.

1848
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:05,330
Okay, we should grab that.

1849
02:02:05,410 --> 02:02:06,310
What do we shove?

1850
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:08,990
I know, but what do we get rid of the clicker?

1851
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:10,070
But he's so upset.

1852
02:02:10,150 --> 02:02:11,490
He's ambitious, though.

1853
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:12,610
Oh, wait.

1854
02:02:12,670 --> 02:02:13,570
Put it in drawer.

1855
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:14,710
Okay, put it in drawer.

1856
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:18,050
And then...

1857
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:19,010
He quit.

1858
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:19,870
Okay.

1859
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:22,870
Yeah, because our treasure.

We want the treasure.

1861
02:02:25,530 --> 02:02:26,110
Clicker good?

1862
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:27,690
But what do we get rid of?

1863
02:02:30,270 --> 02:02:31,210
I don't know.

1864
02:02:31,330 --> 02:02:32,550
They're all so good.

1865
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:40,340
Stongs?

1866
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:42,440
Put the stongs away?

1867
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,240
Or clicker better than shrooms?

1868
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:47,500
Okay, put it in drawer.

1869
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:50,380
Alright, let's do this.

1870
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:54,880

02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:38,090
I feel like the shroom has done more.

1878
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:39,890
I'm not sure yet, though.

1879
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:44,170
