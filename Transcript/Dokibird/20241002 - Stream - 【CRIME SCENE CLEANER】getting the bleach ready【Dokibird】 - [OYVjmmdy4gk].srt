1
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,750
Oh, okay.

2
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,390
I just made it back just in time.

3
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,650
I literally like... I literally came out just to like to wash my... I got a new package yesterday.

4
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,050
And it's a new gamer subs cup.

5
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,890
So like, you know, what's the best thing?

6
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,170
Sorry.

7
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,010
He's being... He thinks I have food on me, but I don't.

8
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,250
I literally I just opened a gamer subs package.

9
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,550
Anyway, if you guys want 10% off your gamer subs, it is use the code DOUGHGAMER.

10
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:14,830
Kiki bird.

11
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,850
Anyway, I really need it.

12
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,230
I need some caffeine right now.

13
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,830
I'm so tired.

14
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,590
My sleep schedule is a fucking mess, by the way.

15
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,690
So when you're a gamer subs partner, it's not food.

16
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,030
It's literally a cup and some powder.

17
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,550
Anyway.

18
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,990
Anyway, I was pouring water, by the way.

19
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,250
So into my gamer subs cup.

20
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:57,870
Anyway, as I was saying, when you are a gamer subs partner, you get to have... you get sent free packages of... Look, he's... Okay, the reason why he's really angry right now is because he thinks I have food.

21
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,590
It's powder!

22
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,510
It's powder!

23
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,590
Okay.

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,090
Okay.

25
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,830
Give me a sec.

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,310
I... It's powder.

27
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,210
It's not food!

28
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,050
It's...

29
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,470
Bring me back to the bed.

30
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,270
You get free packages of newly released items.

31
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:29,750
So whenever they have... whenever they release like a new... like it's not waifu cups, but like just like new cups in general when it comes to like products they're doing and new like flavors or whatever.

32
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,410
They usually send me the... they send... I don't know if they do it for anybody else.

33
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:44,250
I think... I'm pretty sure they do it for everybody else, but they would send me free packages of all... like, you know.

34
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,450
Of like the newest products and stuff.

35
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,010
So...

36
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,350
So like yesterday I got it and I was like, oh, thank God.

37
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,030
I need some... I need some caffeine anyway.

38
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,590
I was like, oh, thank God.

39
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,070
I really needed caffeine.

40
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,450
So... so I'm just trying it out right now.

41
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,110
So, all right.

42
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,690
Story time.

43
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,650
Okay.

44
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,310
Story time.

45
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:13,670
So the reason why I was... I had to be a little late is that I had a bed appointment today at like 3.20.

46
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,250
PM and then it ended.

47
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,930
I didn't realize this, but it was supposed to be a regular checkup, by the way.

48
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,470
It is supposed to be super regular checkup, like just to see if...

49
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,990
If the... he's on this like anti-scratching medication.

50
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:40,710
So like, we... I give it to him like one tablet a day and it like helps suppress his itchiness because of his allergies.

51
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,270
So... so like that's what I... so like...

52
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,970
I had to get refill on the prescription because today was like, I only have two pills left.

53
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,190
Two pills left.

54
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,570
So I had to get a refill today and it was just a regular checkup.

55
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,430
And I got there.

56
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,030
I got there.

57
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,510
Yeah.

58
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,850
And then we were doing our regular checkup and then the vet looked into his ear and was like, oh, my God.

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,670
And then...

60
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,270
And then...

61
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,590
And then...

62
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,250
And then...

63
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,710
it was like, there's a lot of discharge in there.

64
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,210
And I was like, huh?

65
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,310
I was like, oh no, is it because of that guy, and he's like, have you been cleaning the ear?

66
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,090
and I was like, oh, not since I moved, because I...

67
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,250
Usually my dad would do it.

68
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,030
And I was like that's since I moved.

69
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,530
And then I saw as like the worst of my fault.

70
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,750
And then...

71
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,250
So then...

72
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:51,150
And then she was like, okay, I'm gonna take him to the back and I'm gonna look into his ear and also like scrub his ears for a test.

73
00:05:51,390 --> 00:06:05,110
So then she took him to the back and I was like, I'm pretty sure he got his ears cleaned when I took him to the groomer.

74
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,030
Which was one month ago.

75
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,170
So the last time he got his ears cleaned was a month ago.

76
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,650
And so then I was like, oh...

77
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,770
And then she came back and she was like, it's a mess.

78
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,130
And I was like, huh?

79
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,210
And she was like, she just opened the door and she was like, it's a mess.

80
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,630
And I was like, huh?

81
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,770
And then she was like, yeah, like one ear is okay.

82
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,410
But the other ear, yeah.

83
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,930
And then I was like, oh no.

84
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,430
And she was like, yeah, there's like yeast and like a bacteria in one of the ear.

85
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,010
But the other ear is fine.

86
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,430
Like she still has yeast in there.

87
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,290
She still has like yeast in that ear, but like it's not that bad.

88
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,950
Like it's just, it's like a lot better than the other ear.

89
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,910
So, and it was, it's not infected.

90
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,610
And I was like, oh, and I was like, is it my fault?

91
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,150
I didn't clean his ears properly.

92
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,670
I didn't clean his ears for a month.

93
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,650
It's like my fault.

94
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,830
And she's like, no, no, it's not your fault actually.

95
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,410
And I was so fucking relieved.

96
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,890
Apparently it's because of his allergies.

97
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:25,190
He's like, she was like, no, no, because usually because he is allergic to everything in the fucking world.

98
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,850
She was like, because he's like really allergic to everything in the fucking world.

99
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,990
That like dogs with these types of allergies tend to get ear infections.

100
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,870
Incredibly easily, especially for like yeast and stuff.

101
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,010
And then I was like, oh, thank God.

102
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,990
Oh, thank fucking God.

103
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,430
And she was like, yeah, it's very common.

104
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:59,250
And I was like, oh, oh, not, I mean, not great for me because that means I have to pay more.

105
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,230
And like, I have to bring you back to the vet again.

106
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,910
And I was just like, oh, thank God.

107
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,510
But at least it wasn't my fault.

108
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,590
I was like...

109
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,130
I was like...

110
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,070
Thank God.

111
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,890
At least it wasn't my fault.

112
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,030
But also, oh, fuck.

113
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,870
Like, that's more money I have to spend.

114
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,410
Like, that's more money I have to spend today.

115
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:29,750
And then so, so she was like, yeah, like, oh, I put too much water in my gamer subs cup.

116
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:43,350
And then she was like, yeah, so we're going to have, you're going to have to like, you're going to have to like, uh, uh, have to buy this medicine to clean your dog's ears for 10 days.

117
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,990
And that shit freaks me out because my dad used to do it.

118
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,490
And now that I live by myself, I have to do it.

119
00:08:48,590 --> 00:09:00,470
So like, I'm a little freaked out about that because like I, because he had to stick this like medication thing into his ear and then squirt it and then like massage his ear.

120
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,930
And like, I'm scared.

121
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,310
I'm so scared.

122
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,090
Because it has to be like in his ear canal too.

123
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,710
It has to be like in his fucking ear canal.

124
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,810
And then like, I gotta make sure he sits still.

125
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,050
And like, I have to be like, squeeze it in.

126
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,590
He's like, make sure to squeeze it good.

127
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,430
And then like massage his ears and everything.

128
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,950
Massage the backside of his ear and everything.

129
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,610
And I'm like, oh no.

130
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,890
Cause like I, the scary part is literally like sticking the thing in his ear, in his ear canal.

131
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,450
And that's like the scariest shit.

132
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,190
Yeah.

133
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:38,950
Anyway.

134
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,610
So, so yeah.

135
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,570
So it was like a 200.

136
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,270
So it was supposed to be a regular fast checkup.

137
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,650
And then it turned into like an hour and 30 minutes.

138
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,570
And I was like, no.

139
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,730
I was like, I was supposed to be.

140
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,110
It was supposed to be a fast.

141
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,270
By the way.

142
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,790
And I literally came here for a refill of my prescription.

143
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,030
But I think the vet forgot.

144
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,150
The vet forgot about it.

145
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,810
Because I, when I was like.

146
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,530
She was like, all right.

147
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,170
Is everything good?

148
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,630
I was like, yeah.

149
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,590
And then she's like, okay, you can pay up in the front.

150
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,590
So I went to the front.

151
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,350
I was like, she like gave me the ear medicine.

152
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,430
And I was like, oh, what about the refill on my prescription?

153
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,130
And then the reception lady was like, oh, you're not.

154
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,350
We didn't put that.

155
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,670
We don't have any left.

156
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,510
Like we didn't, we didn't like know that I was like your order.

157
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,170
And I was like, that was the whole point of this checkup.

158
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,310
That was literally the whole.

159
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,050
I can't just stop the medication.

160
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,450
He literally has to take one tablet every day for the rest of his life.

161
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,390
What do you mean?

162
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,070
You didn't know?

163
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,890
Like, what do you mean?

164
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,070
It's an everyday thing.

165
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,150
I can't just stop.

166
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,370
But like, basically, basically she's like, oh yeah.

167
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,650
Like we have to reorder the prescription.

168
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:05,790
Like we got, we have to, we have to reorder the prescription.

169
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,770
And y'all have to go back to the vet to like pick it up.

170
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,310
And I'm like, are you serious?

171
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,530
I was just like, are you serious?

172
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,030
What do you mean?

173
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,400
The point was literally to get a refill.

174
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,460
Anyway, so they're like, we're going to order it.

175
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,480
And then like the moment it comes in stock, you can come over and pick it up.

176
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,840
And I'm like, okay.

177
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,860
Like, I'm just like, okay.

178
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,620
I'm so sad because that means I have to pay for another appointment.

179
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,280
And like, I guess like, no, I have to pay for not, I could just grab the prescription.

180
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,260
But that means I have to pay for an Uber to get there and then Uber back.

181
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,580
Like I don't have to bring a dad along, but I still have to, I still have to Uber there.

182
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,840
I was so sad.

183
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
I was just like, what do you mean?

184
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,460
You don't have any, you have to ordering more.

185
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm like, this was the reason I came to, I didn't go to the checkup for his fucking ears.

186
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,160
We discovered the ear problem on the checkup.

187
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,400
Like we discovered the ear problem on the checkup.

188
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,400
I literally just got here to check up on his, like, get the refill on the prescription and to see if it's like doing okay.

189
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,640
And the medication is working.

190
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:34,820
Cause it's working.

191
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,540
Cause it was my first time using that medication.

192
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,900
Um, because like, um, I'm pretty sure it's a new thing.

193
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,340
Like the tablet thing, because like a couple of years ago, um, the tablet thing didn't exist.

194
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
It was usually just shots.

195
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,940
Uh, you get a shot or whatever, but like tablet thing is new and it's less like, like you don't have to do like needles and everything.

196
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:01,640
Um, and like now, so like, this was the first time of me trying the medication with like one tablet a day and it was working.

197
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,500
It actually is working.

198
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,820
His hair is starting to grow back, which is fucking crazy.

199
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,600
I've never seen hair on his ears before, but like it's starting to, it's starting to grow back.

200
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,160
Like I was like, oh my God, it's not fully white now.

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,240
I can't, it's not just skin.

202
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,640
I literally see like strands of hair on his ears.

203
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,260
Like, no, he's still bald.

204
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:30,760
But like, you know, like when a balding person has like a little bit of hair, like he's still bald, but like you can see like some strands of hair, which is good.

205
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,440
So like that was a whole point of the visit.

206
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,800
But like in the end, like it's okay.

207
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,660
It fucked me over.

208
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,020
Cause they're like, yeah, like we didn't have like, I don't understand.

209
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,660
I don't understand.

210
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,100
Go

211
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,090
back.

212
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,550
Okay.

213
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,090
Anyway, anyway, um, now I have to deal with his ears too.

214
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:58,510
So like he has a lot of, he has, he's a genetic freak, but like I've accepted it since he was, since he turned one year.

215
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,990
So I, for like one year, he was a normal dog.

216
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,470
He was literally a normal fucking dog for one entire year.

217
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,450
And then after that year was over.

218
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,310
He, his allergies developed and I fucking live with it since.

219
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,630
Like I've accepted, I've accepted his face.

220
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,370
Anyway, um, anyway, um, what was I gonna say?

221
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,730
Oh yeah.

222
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:36,610
Um, yesterday was very depressing for dad because, um, I took him to the dog park.

223
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,170
And, um.

224
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:47,530
I took him, uh, uh, to the dog park and, um, there was no small dogs.

225
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,650
Uh, there were no small dogs at the park.

226
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:59,150
And, uh, I was very sad because, um, I was like, oh no, I, all I wanted to do was interact.

227
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,050
It was him to interact with other dogs.

228
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,030
Like that was the reason why I took him to the dog park.

229
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,730
And so, so it was very sad.

230
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,870
It was so sad.

231
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,770
I felt really bad because he was a loner like me.

232
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:24,290
So, so it, it was just big dogs coming in and, but I couldn't put him to the big dog park because he's way too small for the big dog park.

233
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,050
And I was really scared that big dog was gonna come over there and knock him down because that happened last time.

234
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,950
And so, so, so I, I literally was like, okay, I'm gonna wait for an hour.

235
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,710
I didn't bring a ball this time.

236
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:45,430
The one day I didn't bring a ball because I was really worried that like he was gonna get bullied for his ball again.

237
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,050
And I didn't want to deal with that today, yesterday.

238
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,590
So I was like, okay, I'm not gonna bring a ball.

239
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,330
There has to be other dogs here because there were other dogs.

240
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,370
So there was, I didn't bring a ball this time.

241
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,250
The one time I didn't bring a ball because I didn't want him to get bullied.

242
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,150
Um, because other dogs would steal his ball.

243
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,930
So like, that's why I didn't bring it.

244
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,630
And then he would get really upset about it and start like harassing the owners and be like, make your dog behave.

245
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,990
I didn't want him to also harass the owners.

246
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:19,750
Cause like last time he would like, he would walk up to the owners and like harass them for their, for his ball.

247
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,710
And he was like, give me my ball back.

248
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,390
Oh, I didn't tell the story in the public stream.

249
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,570
Sorry, I told the story in the member stream, but he literally, the other dogs would steal his ball.

250
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,430
And then he would bark at them and they wouldn't give the ball back.

251
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,630
So instead of like barking at them even more, he literally figured out who was this dog's owner.

252
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,270
Walked up to the dog's owner.

253
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:43,510
And started barking at them and demanding them to teach that dog a lesson and give back his ball.

254
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,570
And like...

255
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,750
And so I didn't want to do that again.

256
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,210
I didn't want to deal with that again.

257
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,110
So, so I was like, okay.

258
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,750
So if you guys want to see pictures of it, it's in the member stream.

259
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,930
I don't remember what stream was it again guys.

260
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,270
It's in the member stream.

261
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,730
In one of the member stream.

262
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,170
I don't remember which one, but like I showed a picture of it, of what it looks like.

263
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,050
It's so fucking funny.

264
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,810
Anyway, yeah, he knows how to call the manager.

265
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,130
Like he's a fucking Karen.

266
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,210
So I didn't want to deal with that.

267
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,670
And so I was like, okay, I'm not gonna bring a ball.

268
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,130
I don't, I'm not, I'm not going to bring a ball this time.

269
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:38,330
And so it was so sad because no small dog came to the small dog park.

270
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,490
It was an hour.

271
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:47,070
I waited an hour and there was no small dog.

272
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,430
I was so sad.

273
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:56,450
And then the saddest part was that he looks cause it's a fence.

274
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,910
It's fenced up.

275
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,430
So like he could see the other big dogs having fun.

276
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,770
So he would like, he's just walking up to the fence.

277
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,330
And like, he's looking at them.

278
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,390
Like he's just looking across the fence.

279
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,950
It was just like...

280
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,650
I kept barking.

281
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,310
Cause he's like, nah, that'd be it.

282
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:27,110
And then he would like, he would walk up cause there's owners sitting at like against the fence.

283
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,590
The owners of the big dogs are sitting against the fence.

284
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,230
And we would walk up to the lady.

285
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,770
I think the thing that he really wanted to do was...

286
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,290
The ladies.

287
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,050
So there were ladies against the fence.

288
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,250
You know, with the ladies of the big dog owners against the fence.

289
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:49,890
So he kept like walking to the ladies and was like barking at the ladies for pets and stuff.

290
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,990
But the ladies couldn't pet him because there's a fence.

291
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,350
So they would, he would like stick, they would stick their hands out.

292
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,050
And then dad would just be like sniffing them and barking.

293
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,790
Like, pay attention to me.

294
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,110
And I'm like, please, please.

295
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,130
Please, I'm sorry.

296
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,170
I'll stay for another.

297
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,710
I was like, I'm gonna stay for 20 more minutes.

298
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,510
And if there's no small dog, we're leaving.

299
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,070
So I stayed at the dog park for an entire hour.

300
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,630
And literally I felt so bad.

301
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,550
I was like, I'm sorry.

302
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,730
You can't make any friends today.

303
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,330
And yet to see the other dogs have fun.

304
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm so sorry.

305
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,470
I didn't mean to.

306
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,930
I thought there would be some other dogs.

307
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,950
The craziest part was that people were bringing in more dogs.

308
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,050
But they were all big dogs.

309
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,050
It was so fucked up.

310
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,190
I was like, what happened to the small dog economy?

311
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:09,050
Like, I was like, what happened to the small dog economy?

312
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,170
Why is it all big dogs?

313
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,450
It's the big dog meta.

314
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,810
It was a big dog day.

315
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,170
Welcome to the tomato farm.

316
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,090
Welcome, welcome.

317
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,230
But yeah, I felt really bad because I was like, I'm sorry.

318
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,350
I'm sorry you have no friends right now.

319
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,090
I'm just like, I'm sorry.

320
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,330
I'm sorry you gotta be a loner.

321
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,930
I'm so sorry, dad.

322
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,410
And I didn't mean to make you more upset.

323
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,670
I thought it was gonna be a fun day for him.

324
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,750
I was like, yeah, I'm gonna do some exercise with him.

325
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,010
We're gonna go out.

326
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,350
He's gonna make some new friends.

327
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,290
And then I ended up making his day fucking worse.

328
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,890
I was like, I'm sorry.

329
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,070
I didn't mean to make your day worse.

330
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,990
For having you look at the other dogs having fun.

331
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,870
And you can't even do anything about it.

332
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,870
And you just have to look.

333
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,090
I'm like, I'm so sorry.

334
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,490
I thought people would bring in small dogs today.

335
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,110
Oh my god.

336
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,270
One is the loneliest number.

337
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,290
Thank you for the super chat.

338
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,590
Thank you.

339
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:38,950
Thank you.

340
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,630
Hi Toki.

341
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,570
Former dog dad after 14 years with a basset hound.

342
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,670
Ear cleaning is important.

343
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,490
Yeah, I'm gonna start cleaning his ears more after the medication.

344
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,550
Like I used to not do it.

345
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,130
It wasn't me doing the ear cleaning.

346
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,990
So I wasn't sure how many times I was supposed to clean his ears.

347
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,370
Because I know when I took him to the groomers, they cleaned his ears.

348
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,750
But I wasn't sure how many times I was supposed to clean it in general.

349
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,350
Because my dad used to do it all the time.

350
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,190
But now I know.

351
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,090
Oh,

352
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,990
I didn't know that.

353
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,990
I didn't know that.

354
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,990
But it has been helping him, his scratches.

355
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,930
Because I feel like he doesn't scratch anymore, other than his ears.

356
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,510
But now I know why he's scratching his ears.

357
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,370
Because he literally has a fucking yeast infection.

358
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,510
So I was like, oh, that's why.

359
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,890
I was like, that makes so much more sense now.

360
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,090
Because he stopped scratching overall, except for his ears.

361
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,050
And then the vet was like, yeah, he has a yeast infection in his ear.

362
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,050
And I'm like, oh, okay.

363
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,130
And I'm like, okay.

364
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,830
And then I was like, is he okay?

365
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,330
Like, did I...

366
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,450
Did I...

367
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,250
Like...

368
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,470
Are his ears damaged?

369
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,950
And then she was...

370
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,910
The vet was like, no, no, it's just clogged up.

371
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,730
So, like, you just need to clean it.

372
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,350
Like, he can...

373
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,130
It's fine.

374
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,970
Like, the moment you clean it, it's fine.

375
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,790
There's no damage.

376
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,210
Permanent damage or anything.

377
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,370
It's just, like, a really clogged up ear.

378
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,170
Like...

379
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,750
I was like, oh, thank God.

380
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,650
He's like...

381
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,030
She's like, yeah, it didn't affect, like, his inner eardrum.

382
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,730
So don't worry.

383
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,910
It's just the outer area.

384
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,190
So, like, he'll be okay.

385
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,570
It's just very clogged up with yeast.

386
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,530
And, like...

387
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,190
And bacteria.

388
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,270
And I'm like, oh...

389
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,670
Okay, that's good to know.

390
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,630
That's good to know.

391
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,530
I was like, that's why it's extra scratchy.

392
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,830
And I'm like, oh, that makes more sense.

393
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,890
Like, he literally stopped scratching other than his ears.

394
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,810
So I'm like, okay.

395
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,670
That's good to know.

396
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:49,890
That's...

397
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,150
That's very good to know.

398
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,470
Thank you for the Aka so far.

399
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,030
Thank you.

400
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,930
Thank you.

401
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,570
Yeah, he's...

402
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:57,850
He's...

403
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,610
He's...

404
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,030
He's...

405
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,770
He's a problem.

406
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,450
He's just...

407
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,290
He's just a little genetic mess right now.

408
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,730
Alright, before, like, I give...

409
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,250
I actually have a lot of stories to tell today.

410
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,630
But we're playing Crime Scene Cleaner.

411
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,010
So I was...

412
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,390
I wanted to do a little, like, chatting stream.

413
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,890
But I didn't want to be just chatting.

414
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,130
So, like, I decided to play, like, a cleaning game.

415
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,270
Because cleaning games tend to be, like...

416
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,530
Tend to be, like, you know...

417
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,750
You can chat while you clean.

418
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:35,170
And I was, like, debating either doing Power Wash Simulator or...

419
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,170
Sorry, I have hiccups right now.

420
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,910
Or...

421
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,990
And then I found this one.

422
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,330
Crime Scene Cleaner.

423
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,750
I was like, oh, that's cool.

424
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,670
Basically, it's, like...

425
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,810
It's literally, like, Power Wash Simulator.

426
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,790
But you're cleaning blood instead of dirt.

427
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,170
So I was like, oh, that's...

428
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,950
That's...

429
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,450
That's neat.

430
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,430
That's educational.

431
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,870
Like, what if you're, like, you know...

432
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,750
I mean, I feel like that's incredibly educational.

433
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,470
Because what if you're, like, you know...

434
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,010
Full or safe?

435
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,610
Okay, we're turning off HeadBob.

436
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,450
I think HeadBob is not great in general.

437
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,230
I was like, you know, like...

438
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,470
What if, like, you know...

439
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,830
You accidentally stumbled onto...

440
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,470
Somebody fell and, like, you know...

441
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,910
Tripped and died.

442
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,830
And then, like, you know...

443
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,370
People...

444
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,550
You don't want people to blame you for the accident and murder.

445
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,110
So I was like, that's educational, you know?

446
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,950
Like, what if you are put in a situation...

447
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,670
Where you have to clean...

448
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,650
Clean up.

449
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,990
And, like, you don't want people to think it's you.

450
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,350
So it's good to know.

451
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,410
It's good to know in the future, you know?

452
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,710
Try to make sure that you'll be okay.

453
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,150
If it's an accident, it's not a murder.

454
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:49,830
Exactly!

455
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,750
But, like...

456
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,910
You gotta make...

457
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,570
You gotta hide...

458
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,190
If you hide the evidence, then there was never an accident.

459
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,350
If you think about it.

460
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,310
So then you don't have to deal with, like...

461
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,810
You don't have to deal with police.

462
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,430
You don't have to deal with...

463
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,570
Like...

464
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,210
With, like...

465
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,290
A court order.

466
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,350
You don't have to deal with, like...

467
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,070
You know...

468
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,630
Like...

469
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,470
Family of the victim.

470
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,210
And everything.

471
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,210
So...

472
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,430
Having no evidence is better than having evidence.

473
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,670
But this is all hypothetical, of course.

474
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,570
This is all very hypothetical.

475
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:30,890
Um...

476
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,170
Jay!

477
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,930
Thank you for your very first Super Chat!

478
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,270
Thank you!

479
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:34,850
Thank you!

480
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,670
Doki, you're my number one motivation!

481
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,310
Can you get a happy birthday in Cantonese?

482
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:38,730
Of course!

483
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,630
Sayonara!

484
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,230
Jay!

485
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,510
Thank you for the Super Chat!

486
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,870
Thank you!

487
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,490
Thank you!

488
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,450
All right.

489
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,770
I know...

490
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,090
It'll be very interesting.

491
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,030
And, like...

492
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,470
You get to learn how to clean a crime.

493
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,190
I heard, like, this game is very relaxing.

494
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,050
Yeah, crime scene cleaning is a natural...

495
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,790
I used to watch, like, YouTube shorts...

496
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,030
Of a professional...

497
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,790
professional crime scene cleaner.

498
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:02,990
Oh.

499
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,210
Wait, there's a story?

500
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,890
I used to watch, like, YouTube shorts of, like, a crime scene cleaner.

501
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:22,210
And he would tell, like, stories about, like, his life as a crime scene cleaner.

502
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,910
And he also cleans for, like, people who have, like, hoarding issues.

503
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,010
Like, who are hoarders.

504
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,010
And he does, like, those, like, free cleanings for other people.

505
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,370
There are people just for people who have issues with...

506
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,270
...have hoarding issues and stuff.

507
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,170
Yeah, it's very...

508
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,590
It's a very interesting chat.

509
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,430
There's also that lady that cleans abandoned graves.

510
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,130
Yeah, I know.

511
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,330
I was like, why does this have a story?

512
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,080
Wait!

513
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,580
I am!

514
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,900
I am a... I am hiding...

515
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,740
I told you this was going to be educational!

516
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,800
Wait!

517
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,320
I am trying to hide it!

518
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,180
I told you guys!

519
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,900
I told you this is educational!

520
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,380
I'm hiding evidence!

521
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,400
Because of an accident!

522
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,480
How do I get in?

523
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,980
Open the codex.

524
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,200
You can check all the active questionnaire if you got lost.

525
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,640
Okay.

526
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
Look at it already?

527
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,660
Wait, I have a skill tree?

528
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,300
Oh my god!

529
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,660
I have a fucking skill tree!

530
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I'm cleaning!

531
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm going to level up my cleaning, guys.

532
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,380
Collect Tyler's payment and dispose of the body.

533
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,270
I assume...

534
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,380
Did I not look at it already?

535
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,160
Oh, interactions.

536
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:57,980
Okay.

537
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,140
Interact.

538
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,520
Okay.

539
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,220
Oh, shit!

540
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,280
I thought I was just going to be cleaning.

541
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,580
I thought I was going to be relaxing like Pyrewash.

542
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,860
I'm actually cleaning.

543
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,380
What else?

544
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,180
Collectibles.

545
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,540
Oh, shit!

546
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,340
I can't get up!

547
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,980
I wonder where you will find some intriguing collectibles.

548
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,380
Some of them may turn out to be crime evidence.

549
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,720
You must take them away with you or else you will fail the mission.

550
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,220
Has its own icon indicating which category it belongs to.

551
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,460
Evidence, key, cassette, or story collectible.

552
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,280
Okay.

553
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,560
Where the fuck is the evidence?

554
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,580
Okay.

555
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,180
Got to make sure.

556
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,380
Okay.

557
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,900
Punch.

558
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,540
Punch.

559
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,060
Oh, I found a hidden apartment!

560
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,960
Is there anything in here?

561
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,820
For me to collect?

562
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,160
Let's see.

563
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,160
Oh, hey!

564
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,580
Nice!

565
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,000
$100.

566
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,180
All I'm saying is that whoever lives here is dead now.

567
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,320
So everything here is free for all.

568
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,460
Wait, what's this?

569
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,300
If they're dead already, I can take their money.

570
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,160
If they're dead already, I can take their money.

571
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,700
Okay.

572
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,740
I got their keys.

573
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,120
Oh, steal.

574
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:12,780
Nice.

575
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,380
It's not stealing if they're dead.

576
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,920
I'm just gathering evidence, guys.

577
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,820
It's not breaking and entering!

578
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,540
There's nobody that lives here!

579
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,920
How am I breaking and entering if nobody...

580
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,200
Look, eviction notice.

581
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,760
You're hereby required to vacate the premises within 10 days.

582
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,300
Keeping pets are clearly not allowed.

583
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,460
Exactly.

584
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,920
See?

585
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,160
Nobody lives here.

586
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,740
Nobody lives here.

587
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,780
So, like, I can easily take their stuff.

588
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,720
Look, if I can't take their stuff, then people would say grave robbing is a crime.

589
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,800
Then people would say grave robbing is a crime.

590
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,220
A simple-minded welcome to Tamaya Farm!

591
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,360
A simple-minded welcome to Tamaya Farm!

592
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,880
Welcome, welcome!

593
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,460
Oh, it says, secrets neck nearby.

594
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,900
Alright.

595
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,560
Not if the grave is abandoned!

596
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,300
Okay, if the grave is like 300-500 years old.

597
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,320
Okay, if grave robbing is a crime, explain museums.

598
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
is a crime, explain museums.

599
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,900
You can't be like, oh, but those are the British.

600
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,480
Explain the National Museum in New York City.

601
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,640
Explain the National Museum in New York City.

602
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,160
Where some of the things aren't even put to display.

603
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,280
They're locked up in the basement.

604
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,440
It was a gift from the British.

605
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,960
Yeah, the Smithsonian.

606
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,380
Explain the Smithsonian.

607
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,120
Yeah, the Smithsonian.

608
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,680
And you know the worst part?

609
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,580
They made three very successful movies about it.

610
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:47,760
They made three very successful movies about it.

611
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,920
To justify the grave robbing.

612
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,240
To justify the grave robbing.

613
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,700
It's doing our best to be the intro victim It's doing our best to be the intro victim in a supernatural episode.

614
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,460
Snooks, thank you for the super chat.

615
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Thank you, thank you.

616
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,080
To the mindless moron living here.

617
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,220
I'm so sick of you.

618
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,380
Sick of hearing this hippie music every single night.

619
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:15,320
Sick of all your shady looking friends banging on your door and discussing things loudly in the hallway.

620
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,920
You're making my life a fucking hell.

621
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,620
So I'm going to raise the volume a little bit.

622
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,620
Let me know if it's better.

623
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,360
Okay.

624
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,380
Yeah, it was a pretty tough neighborhood from what I see.

625
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,980
Everybody's evicted.

626
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,180
What neighbors?

627
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
What neighbors?

628
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,100
I don't understand.

629
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,920
Everybody is literally evicted.

630
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,680
Wait, how is this so clean?

631
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,140
Except for that over there.

632
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,780
But how is...

633
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,600
Like, what the fuck?

634
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,340
This place is actually pretty decent.

635
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,660
Alright.

636
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,540
Let's see.

637
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,620
Oh hey, another key.

638
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
Alright, alright.

639
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,700
Is that my blood?

640
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,620
Okay, we got to clean.

641
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,360
Collect, dispose the bodies, wipe off all the blood.

642
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,540
Okay, so is my feet...

643
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,060
Does my feet track blood?

644
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,460
Oh, it does.

645
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,140
Okay.

646
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,980
We got to clean this.

647
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,540
Alright.

648
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,540
Clean, clean, clean.

649
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,060
Don't worry.

650
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,040
Just spilled some red paint.

651
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,700
That's all.

652
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,760
Oh no.

653
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,080
Okay.

654
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,280
How do I...

655
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,080
Okay, bucket.

656
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,080
Alright.

657
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,980
Oh, we got to put down at a water source.

658
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,400
Hello.

659
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,480
I mean, there's no body.

660
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,040
Who's to say there was a murder if there's no body?

661
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,180
Okay, let me put that here.

662
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:38,940
Okay.

663
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,920
How do I fill this water up?

664
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,920
Oh, collect.

665
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,980
Oh wait, no.

666
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,620
How do I fill it up?

667
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,160
This is a water source.

668
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,720
Do I use a shower?

669
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,780
Oh, there it is!

670
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,440
Oh, there's a...

671
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,600
Why is there a faucet outside of the shower?

672
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,100
That doesn't make sense.

673
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,160
Alright.

674
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,240
Okay.

675
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,060
Let's see.

676
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,380
Oh!

677
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,240
I use my special eyes to see all the body fluids.

678
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,760
I mean the paint fluids.

679
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,360
Alright, clean.

680
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,640
That's very convenient.

681
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,300
Yeah, I was going to say, who the fuck has that faucet thing?

682
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,740
Um...

683
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,080
I've never seen a shower, like a bathroom area with a faucet outside of the shower.

684
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,740
And it's not like, um...

685
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,820
It's not like the sink or anything.

686
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,500
Alright, my assassin's greed eyes.

687
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,880
What is it called when you put down the bucket to replace the contaminated?

688
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,540
What is it called when you, you know like those like magic, the flashlights?

689
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,240
You know those magic flashlights that, uh...

690
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,380
Wait, how do I put this away?

691
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,600
Clean.

692
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,140
Okay.

693
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,260
I need to collect... UV light!

694
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,400
Yeah, I have UV eyes!

695
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,120
I have UV eyes, guys!

696
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,220
That's my special talent.

697
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,180
It's a very terrible talent, not gonna lie.

698
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,740
Okay, pick up.

699
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,200
Then we...

700
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,600
We...

701
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,080
Make sure it's... We make sure it's new water.

702
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,500
It's like almost fixed.

703
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Oh wait, I forgot this.

704
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,520
Oh shit!

705
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,040
What the fuck was that?

706
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,480
Is that blood?

707
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,760
No, it can't be blood.

708
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,580
Legally, it's not blood.

709
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,000
Guys.

710
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,860
Oh, I can just use my mop to just... Wait, that's convenient, actually.

711
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,120
That's very convenient.

712
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,120
You know what we mean?

713
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,360
Guys?

714
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,020
Okay.

715
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
Guys, wait.

716
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,920
Let me turn the music down.

717
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,740
And then let me...

718
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,900
Okay, guys.

719
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,780
I'm willing to risk it.

720
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,300
Guys, we're not gonna have...

721
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,800
Wait.

722
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,500
Come on!

723
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,760
Alright.

724
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,260
This...

725
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,940
This...

726
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,200
This stream is gonna be demonetized.

727
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,540
This stream is gonna be demonetized.

728
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,780
This stream is gonna be demonetized.

729
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,160
There we go.

730
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,780
Cruella, Cruella De Vil.

731
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,860
Cruella De Vil.

732
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,160
Cruella De Vil.

733
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,300
Yeah!

734
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,640
What?

735
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,380
We're here to do...

736
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,340
It's a nice cleaning soundtrack.

737
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,300
Cruella De Vil.

738
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,020
Cruella De Vil.

739
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I'm saying if I'm gonna be clean, I'm cleaning with my music.

740
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,420
I'm gonna...

741
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,580
I'm gonna be cleaning...

742
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,080
Woah!

743
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,680
It's alright.

744
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,760
Disney Jazz!

745
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,440
Let's fucking go!

746
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,800
I don't remember this scene in the movie.

747
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,280
All I'm saying is that, you know when you're cleaning?

748
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,200
You're cleaning and you gotta... you play your own music?

749
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,840
It's fine, there's no body.

750
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,860
See, there's no body!

751
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,700
Free eye!

752
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,880
Free phone!

753
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,640
Yeah, it's all raspberry jam!

754
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,180
Exactly!

755
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,460
It makes the job go so much faster!

756
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,880
Exactly!

757
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,420
Wait, how the fuck is there blood here?

758
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,440
I don't understand!

759
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,380
Okay, we gotta get rid of this.

760
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,720
I know how many people were killed here!

761
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,580
In general!

762
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,700
Okay, we gotta refill this.

763
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,020
How do I...

764
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,340
How do I fucking refill this?

765
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,720
How do I put this away?

766
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,020
Oh, okay.

767
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,020
It's clean now.

768
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,560
Alright.

769
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,740
Let's boost game volume a little.

770
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,140
Don't worry, I got you.

771
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,540
I mean, we could listen to heavy metal.

772
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,480
I guess we could.

773
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,980
Heavy metal...

774
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,800
Yeah, man.

775
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,640
Alright, nice.

776
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,280
We gotta relax while we're cleaning.

777
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,380
I mean, I could be listening to lo-fi.

778
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,960
Let's get rockin'!

779
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,320
Yeah!

780
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,400
What the fuck?

781
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,980
Wait, Disney heavy metal!

782
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,680
You're right!

783
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,080
Alright.

784
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,400
Finding the right music.

785
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,460
Disney heavy...

786
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,040
Guys, finding the right song to do while you're cleaning is so difficult.

787
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,180
It's so...

788
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,880
It's so difficult.

789
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,320
There we go.

790
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,700
Alright, you're right!

791
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,240
Oh, hey!

792
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,700
Free phone!

793
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,100
Woah!

794
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,220
Wait, okay.

795
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,700
I need...

796
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,620
I need to go to the heavy metal part.

797
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,840
Give me a sec.

798
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,350
Yeah?

799
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,730
Oh, I erased the volume of the right wrong one.

800
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,650
Okay, where's, like, instrumental?

801
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,710
I need, like, instru- Wait, there's a Mickey Mouse watch in metal?

802
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,310
Wait, how does that sound like?

803
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,130
Okay, there you go.

804
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,090
Alright.

805
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,310
Alright.

806
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:47,810
Alright.

807
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,250
We got the evidence.

808
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,030
Oh my god!

809
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,110
The Mickey Mouse March, but heavy metal!

810
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,270
What the fuck?

811
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,870
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

812
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,230
I got distracted with heavy metal.

813
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,550
Alright.

814
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,550
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

815
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,220
M -I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E Oh shit!

816
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,160
Mickey Mouse!

817
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,680
Oh, my mom!

818
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,940
I'm so...

819
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,880
It's not productive anymore!

820
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,860
Oh shit, okay.

821
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,380
U-S-E I'm getting distracted!

822
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,500
Guys, I don't think...

823
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,300
I don't think...

824
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:42,980
Maybe...

825
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,740
Maybe heavy metal Disney was not...

826
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,120
Heavy metal was not it.

827
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,880
Mickey Mouse!

828
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,460
Hi!

829
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:53,740
Hi!

830
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,260
Hi!

831
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,800
I guess you're a blood puppet.

832
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:06,240
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E Mickey Mouse Club!

833
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,720
No!

834
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,220
Shit!

835
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,520
I'm making a better mess!

836
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,620
Not a good cleansing cleaner!

837
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,760
No!

838
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,520
No!

839
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,080
No!

840
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,860
No!

841
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,300
It's okay!

842
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,260
I can fix it!

843
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,740
I can't help it!

844
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,400
It's so good!

845
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,180
Okay.

846
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,180
Alright, let's clean this part, guys.

847
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,080
Alright, alright.

848
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,980
Back to the lo-fi.

849
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,820
I think I was more...

850
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,560
I was more focused on...

851
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,500
I was more focused on...

852
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,340
I was more focused on...

853
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,300
When I was clean...

854
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,740
When I was actually...

855
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,880
When I was actually listening to jazz and lo-fi.

856
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,560
Alright, back to lo-fi.

857
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,860
Alright, we're gonna go to the lo-fi.

858
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,920
I'm gonna listen to lo-fi now.

859
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,780
Alright, this...

860
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,580
Ba-ba-ba.

861
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,300
Ba-da-dum.

862
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,880
Ba-ba-dum.

863
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,840
Ba-dum-ba-ba-dum.

864
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,080
Ba-ba-ba-dum.

865
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,700
Ba -ba -ba -ba -dum.

866
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:04,880
Ba-ba-ba-ba-dum.

867
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,180
Ba-ba-ba-ba-dum.

868
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,200
Ba -ba-ba-ba-dum.

869
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,960
Classical lo-fi.

870
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:07,940
What?

871
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,580
We're cleaning!

872
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,040
It's a relaxing time!

873
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,560
Guys, we can't...

874
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,480
Guys, we can't listen to rock!

875
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,280
If we listen to rock, we're not doing our job!

876
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,060
We're too busy jamming!

877
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,180
Ba-ba-dum.

878
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,940
We're cleaning the table.

879
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,440
I feel like I could use other stuff, but like...

880
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,660
I feel like the mop was the best.

881
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,640
There we go.

882
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,440
I say you listen to some salsa.

883
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,280
I feel like you're making multiple companies fight for copyright!

884
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,780
Wait, how did you know?

885
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,320
That's my key!

886
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,400
That's my solution!

887
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,000
If I'm listening to copyright songs, I make multiple companies, like, do copyright strikes.

888
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,040
So, like...

889
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,520
Not copyright strikes, but like, fight for, like, the monetization.

890
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,820
So it doesn't matter in the end.

891
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,220
Wait, how did you guys...

892
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,220
That's my strategy!

893
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,500
I actually do that!

894
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:14,020
Like, that's why I would listen to a variety of, like, not just Disney, but like, Ghibli and 2, and like, Nintendo and Pokemon.

895
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,740
So they all fight for, like, my monetization.

896
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,820
And they all want their one cent!

897
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,180
Oh my god!

898
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,980
Using mop here?

899
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,580
What do you mean?

900
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,700
It's been so effective!

901
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,500
I've been cleaning everything with my mop!

902
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,640
Okay, wait.

903
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,460
How do I...

904
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,540
Okay.

905
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,660
I keep forgetting.

906
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,720
Oh, how do I put this away?

907
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,720
How do I put...

908
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,280
No, I don't...

909
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,160
Put your hands away, sir!

910
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,520
Put your hands away!

911
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,960
How do I do that?

912
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,480
I'm trying to make him put his hands away.

913
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,020
How do I...

914
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,100
Put your hands away!

915
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,560
Put...

916
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:57,960
Oh, one.

917
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,920
Okay, there we go.

918
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,560
It's one.

919
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,240
Okay.

920
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,800
Cool.

921
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:03,900
Alright.

922
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,280
Remove hands now!

923
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,560
Alright, let's...

924
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,900
Okay, I can make the song a little quieter.

925
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,600
Do copyright things get cut out of the super chats?

926
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,420
No, they don't!

927
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,440
It's just monetization.

928
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,580
That's why I don't care sometimes.

929
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,500
Because like, as long as I can have the super chats, that's fine.

930
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,160
I just feel like it's more relaxing to clean with lo-fi.

931
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,100
Oh, it's the run!

932
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,260
Oh, it's the run!

933
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,140
Can you just move the bucket?

934
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,260
Yeah, I'm about to clean the bucket too, and that's like... that's too much.

935
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,640
I'd rather just go back.

936
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,240
I don't want to refill the bucket.

937
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,340
I'd rather just run back and forth.

938
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,260
Can we clean one?

939
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,940
Yeah, but I'm not focused when I'm cleaning with electric swing.

940
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,480
Okay, how about I give you guys... I can give you guys Nintendo Jazz.

941
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,300
Alright.

942
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,160
Guys, I know we're never going to listen to a full song, but like...

943
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,380
Yeah, it's about the cardio, chat.

944
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,140
It's the cardio.

945
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:20,160
Alright, let me give you guys Nintendo... Okay, gaming jazz music.

946
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,820
Okay, you're not focused.

947
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,560
There you go.

948
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,040
There you go.

949
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,500
Let's listen to some jazz.

950
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,500
Alright, this should work.

951
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,580
I guess like if I'm... if I have to use a sponge here, right?

952
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,040
Alright, scrub, scrub, scrub.

953
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,940
Scrub, scrub.

954
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,300
Alright, this is... we're not swapping for now.

955
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,800
We're going to swap until after this playlist is done.

956
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah, not just any kind of jazz, but gaming jazz.

957
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,440
I might be late tonight, sorry.

958
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,600
You want a date or something, Cathy?

959
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,260
No, just going to buy.

960
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,380
Just going to buy some... some devil's lettuce and have fun.

961
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,140
Alright, see you... wait, he killed?

962
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,740
He killed somebody for the devil's lettuce?

963
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,460
You can get that like... you can go to a dispensary.

964
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,080
What?

965
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,320
You can literally... you can literally go to a dispensary.

966
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,520
It's not even illegal anymore.

967
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,360
In like some states in America.

968
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,600
Isn't it?

969
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:31,920
Yeah.

970
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,140
Yeah, I was going to say.

971
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,380
Stab to death?

972
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,380
Oh shit!

973
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,820
Alright, let me clean this up first.

974
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,960
Look, if I want to get to the body, I don't want to get my... my feet like dirty here.

975
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,900
Alright, let's just clean this up real fast.

976
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,220
Alright, let's clean this... clean this body real fast.

977
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:56,760
Okay.

978
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,120
Pick up and throw.

979
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,960
Once you find a dead body, it should be removed from the crime scene.

980
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,300
Pick it up and take it.

981
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:05,660
Oh, okay.

982
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,680
There's my cleaner sense.

983
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,180
I have a bucket too?

984
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,620
Fearing the ability... the better bucket can create a combinations of stuff.

985
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,560
Oh, you're right.

986
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,820
Animal Crossing tunes.

987
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,740
You're right.

988
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,740
It's so hard to find nice music to...

989
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,120
Oh, you're right.

990
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,880
We should listen to some Animal Crossing coffee shop.

991
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,840
Alright.

992
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,560
There we go.

993
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,460
This is the last time we swap music.

994
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,200
Alright.

995
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,380
Oh hey, there's some free pizza.

996
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,640
That's nice.

997
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,660
90% changing songs.

998
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,700
10% use just Eevee.

999
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,620
You played the game too hard.

1000
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,860
Okay, let's clean the blood around.

1001
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,340
Let's clean the blood around his body first though.

1002
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,580
I'll make sure to clean the blood stains off your jacket too.

1003
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,980
Because even if you're dead, you gotta look good.

1004
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:08,920
You know?

1005
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,420
Gotta make sure you're nice and clean.

1006
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,220
Um...

1007
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,020
Nice.

1008
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,920
Yeah, you just spilled...

1009
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,640
Oh, there's some blood.

1010
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,780
That's so bloody for like one stab wound.

1011
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:20,820
Like...

1012
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,900
Like it's so bloody.

1013
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,560
Literally, it's just one stab.

1014
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,860
How did you lose that much blood?

1015
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:29,140
How did you lose that much blood?

1016
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,040
It's not even like...

1017
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,900
Like his jacket's not even that bloody.

1018
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,660
Don't understand.

1019
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,740
It's a mega stab.

1020
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,040
It's not just...

1021
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,540
No, it is.

1022
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,360
See, it's one guy.

1023
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,140
See?

1024
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,740
It's literally one guy.

1025
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,460
Oh my god, wait.

1026
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,640
Is it two guys?

1027
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,220
Wait a minute.

1028
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,240
Is this two guys?

1029
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,580
Oh shit, Cathy!

1030
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,960
Seems like our guy had another hobby.

1031
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,920
Oh, wait.

1032
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,240
Oh, okay.

1033
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:13,960
It's just one girl.

1034
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:14,860
Okay, that's fine.

1035
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,260
I mean, that's not fine.

1036
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,060
But like...

1037
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,960
It's less fucked up.

1038
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,020
It's...

1039
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,660
I thought, you know...

1040
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,560
I thought like it was very...

1041
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,620
Relevant to like a current situation.

1042
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,340
Like a current court case that's going on right now.

1043
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,540
And I was like, oh fuck.

1044
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,980
Is this like a pair...

1045
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,240
Like...

1046
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,620
Like a reference to that?

1047
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,820
And I was like, oh, okay.

1048
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,140
It's...

1049
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,580
It's just one girl for now.

1050
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,060
There's no baby oil anywhere.

1051
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,500
There's no...

1052
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,300
There's no...

1053
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,260
Okay.

1054
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,680
All right.

1055
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,480
All right.

1056
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:47,940
Well...

1057
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,680
Well, we have two murders.

1058
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,800
We gotta...

1059
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,520
We gotta clean up now.

1060
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,400
Okay.

1061
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,560
We're gonna...

1062
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,620
We're gonna...

1063
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:56,700
Okay.

1064
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,000
Don't worry.

1065
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,040
It's pretty relaxing though.

1066
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,120
A little more music.

1067
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,760
There's not much going on in game.

1068
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,340
All right.

1069
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,880
We'll boost up the music too.

1070
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:04,860
Oh, yeah.

1071
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,920
I should be using...

1072
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,280
I don't know why I'm using my sponge.

1073
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,440
I could use...

1074
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,020
I could use my mop now.

1075
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,460
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

1076
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:16,840
Thank you.

1077
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,420
Thank you.

1078
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,540
I was off the grid for a week and itching like a dookie in a card shop.

1079
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,520
Thank you for the super chat, Smurf.

1080
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:23,920
Thank you.

1081
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,520
Thank you.

1082
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,380
Okay.

1083
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,400
Let's see.

1084
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,300
You think I can refill this?

1085
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,080
Yeah, I think so.

1086
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,860
Oh, let's clean our sponge too.

1087
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,140
Our sponge needs some cleaning as well.

1088
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,240
All right.

1089
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,360
Oh, is this more evidence?

1090
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,780
Oh, nice.

1091
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,780
At least he's...

1092
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,820
Oh, he doesn't try his product.

1093
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,740
Good for him.

1094
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,960
Good for him.

1095
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,280
But what's this?

1096
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,680
That's a bong.

1097
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,380
What does he have a bong then?

1098
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:55,620
Like...

1099
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,360
Messy!

1100
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,820
I don't know how to read this.

1101
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,820
Oh, it's just...

1102
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,240
He's the same.

1103
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,380
He's the same.

1104
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,600
I don't know.

1105
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,380
I don't know.

1106
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:08,560
I don't know.

1107
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,740
I don't know.

1108
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,100
I can't find it.

1109
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,360
I think I lost it.

1110
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:17,560
Okay.

1111
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,240
Let's do this.

1112
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,820
I've done this a number of times.

1113
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,500
Oh, please.

1114
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:21,800
Oh, my gosh.

1115
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,000
It's just a informações cache.

1116
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,240
I just saved you guys a pep time.

1117
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,020
Which gives you a chance to plan for your schedule.

1118
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,320
Tweet.

1119
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,880
Okay.

1120
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,040
Alright.

1121
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,640
Is there any blood here?

1122
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,260
Okay, there's blood here.

1123
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,020
That's fine.

1124
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,980
Oh, I should pick up the- I'll pick up the trash later.

1125
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,560
Alright, boost up the music a little bit and also the game volume.

1126
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,160
What's this?

1127
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,300
Oh shit!

1128
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,460
Oh, it's classical music!

1129
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,180
We should listen to classical music!

1130
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,620
Oh my god!

1131
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,160
We should listen to some nice classical music!

1132
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,680
Alright.

1133
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,600
Classical music that slaps.

1134
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,260
There we go.

1135
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,340
There we go.

1136
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:10,760
Nice.

1137
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,280
Oh!

1138
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,420
Oh!

1139
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,980
Is that one lady?

1140
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,200
Oh!

1141
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,960
Okay, it's two ladies.

1142
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,300
Alright.

1143
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,940
It's time to do my job.

1144
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,440
I should use a sponge.

1145
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,320
Oh shit!

1146
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:55,720
Sorry.

1147
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,600
Sorry, ma'am.

1148
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,220
Okay, how do I get down from here?

1149
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:06,440
What?

1150
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,060
It's copyright free after playing several copyright music!

1151
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,280
This is copyright free!

1152
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:14,900
We should be safe now.

1153
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,460
We should be safe now!

1154
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:23,900
I'm sorry, I think that Doki might be a psycho.

1155
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,220
What do you mean?

1156
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,980
I'm trying to- I'm just trying to find the perfect music to clean!

1157
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,160
Ahem.

1158
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,980
Look, it still works, man!

1159
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,560
I don't care if you think it's ineffective!

1160
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,080
I'm still cleaning!

1161
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,660
Since we're challenging copyright tonight, here's a request for Disney Eurobee.

1162
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,500
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1163
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,340
Thank you.

1164
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,220
Thank you, thank you.

1165
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,560
I'm just making sure this lady is nice and clean.

1166
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,040
Nice.

1167
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,000
Don't worry, I'll clean your clothes up a little bit too.

1168
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,080
There we go.

1169
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,180
Is the music loud enough?

1170
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,680
There we go.

1171
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,860
Wait, there's a faucet there?

1172
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,280
Oh, bring that bucket over.

1173
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,300
Alright, let's bring that bucket over.

1174
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,480
There's a closer...

1175
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,540
Oh, my water!

1176
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,020
Oh.

1177
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,860
Okay, that's fine.

1178
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,160
It's too...

1179
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,080
Alright, there's a... there's a... Oh, no!

1180
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,320
No, my bucket!

1181
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:40,920
Alright.

1182
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,840
It's alright.

1183
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,700
Oh, there it is!

1184
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,000
Nice.

1185
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,480
Okay, that's very convenient, actually.

1186
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,620
Alright.

1187
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,560
Alright, is that everything?

1188
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,240
Okay.

1189
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,080
Oh, so...

1190
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,120
Oh, my God!

1191
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,020
Wait, he uses the blood to paint pictures?

1192
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,540
Holy shit!

1193
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,540
You guys call me crazy?

1194
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,460
Bro, this guy uses the blood of his victims!

1195
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,840
To, like... to, like, paint!

1196
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,520
This guy's fucking insane!

1197
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,040
All I'm doing is listening to classical music while cleaning!

1198
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,260
How creative!

1199
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,320
Well, people... some people say this... my... my stuff is creative, too.

1200
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,640
I guess, like...

1201
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,340
I guess we're gonna throw this away.

1202
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,660
Can I not throw his art away?

1203
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,620
I guess not?

1204
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,580
Oh, I guess... I can't throw his art away.

1205
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,880
I guess it's too beautiful.

1206
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,580
Unless I use detergent.

1207
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,540
Oh, I can...

1208
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,020
Oh, I should've been using detergent!

1209
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,560
I should've been using normal.

1210
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,660
No, he drew a chicken.

1211
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,380
And, like...

1212
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,020
A rocket ship.

1213
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,440
I mean, he's very creative.

1214
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:03,140
Like...

1215
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,400
Competing with a psycho.

1216
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,080
I'm not competing with a psycho!

1217
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,040
I'm saying...

1218
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,160
I don't understand why you compare me to him when he literally is, like...

1219
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,260
Oh, I can break it!

1220
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,020
Oh, I have to break his art!

1221
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,520
No, but I could still do it!

1222
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,380
I could sell for money!

1223
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,200
I could just be like, that's chicken blood!

1224
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,100
You know?

1225
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,960
I could just be like, that's chicken blood.

1226
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,560
It's not real... It's not real human blood.

1227
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,400
They can't tell.

1228
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,660
Blood is blood.

1229
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,100
I'm pretty sure, like, human blood is, like, the same smell as, like, chicken blood.

1230
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,200
Well, crazy, yes.

1231
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,620
The only difference is there are psychopaths like this.

1232
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,440
Thank you for the super chat.

1233
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:47,960
Thank you.

1234
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,760
Thank you.

1235
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,740
Okay.

1236
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:49,900
Okay.

1237
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,280
Oh, no.

1238
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:50,940
Can I grab this?

1239
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:51,340
Okay.

1240
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,580
Alright.

1241
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,100
Collect multiple.

1242
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,200
There we go.

1243
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,040
Alright.

1244
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,060
How does she know that?

1245
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,400
I assume blood... No, it's just... It's just an assumption, guys!

1246
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,700
It is just an assumption, everybody!

1247
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,960
Like, it's just using critical thinking!

1248
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,300
Alright.

1249
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:17,780
Alright.

1250
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,960
Are we removing evidence?

1251
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,460
I told you this is educational.

1252
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,740
Like, this is something you should be doing.

1253
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:26,760
Okay.

1254
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,760
How do I... Why is this not going into the trash?

1255
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,240
It belongs in the trash.

1256
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,060
Oh, I have to punch it!

1257
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:34,340
Okay.

1258
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,800
Alright.

1259
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:38,600
Alright.

1260
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,080
Nice.

1261
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,220
For a serial killer?

1262
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,540
I mean, like...

1263
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,220
Maybe... Maybe those ladies deserve it.

1264
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,620
Maybe they're also serial killers and this is a Dexter scenario.

1265
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,240
We don't know that.

1266
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,020
This could be, like, Dexter.

1267
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,700
We don't know what the ladies have been doing and that one guy.

1268
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,580
That lady could have been, like...

1269
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,460
What was it?

1270
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,300
The Zodiac Killer.

1271
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,660
We don't know that.

1272
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,740
I don't think they...

1273
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,300
They could easily be the Zodiac Killer.

1274
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,420
We don't have evidence that they're innocent.

1275
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,320
Alright.

1276
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,020
Is the music okay now?

1277
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:26,620
Alright.

1278
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,700
Let's see the evidence here.

1279
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,940
Well, now we're here.

1280
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,860
Oh, it's too... How many ladies has it been?

1281
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,400
Oh, yeah.

1282
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,060
This guy was a little freaky.

1283
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,200
Like, look at them toes.

1284
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,820
Okay.

1285
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,440
What's this?

1286
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,920
Ropes and Knots.

1287
00:58:51,560 --> 00:59:02,640
This book sells through the history types and use of ropes while trying together detailed instructions, illustrations, and practical applications of various knots.

1288
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,060
Oh!

1289
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,940
Is this a real book?

1290
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,280
By Albert de Salle...

1291
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,120
Wait, is this real?

1292
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,700
Wait, is this a real book?

1293
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,660
Ropes and Knots book.

1294
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,780
Albert...

1295
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,140
I'm just... It's for science.

1296
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:23,300
Albert de Salvo, Jr. Was a...

1297
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,580
Don't look him up.

1298
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,080
Don't look him up.

1299
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,960
Don't look him up.

1300
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,640
I don't get it.

1301
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,220
Alright, here we go.

1302
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,060
Alright, let's put this body away.

1303
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,400
Don't worry.

1304
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,060
No, no, no.

1305
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,140
No, no, no, no.

1306
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,880
If you really want to know, you can look him up yourself.

1307
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,460
You can look him...

1308
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,680
You can look him up yourself.

1309
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,840
Alright, time to put this body away.

1310
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,020
Alright.

1311
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,700
Don't worry.

1312
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,880
Nobody's gonna know.

1313
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,540
They'll just think it's like...

1314
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,800
A wax figure.

1315
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,200
Or like those mannequins.

1316
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,580
Wait, am I just...

1317
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,280
Do I just...

1318
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,780
Put him in my car?

1319
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:29,820
Like...

1320
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,260
Just like that?

1321
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,680
Just like that?

1322
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,080
Like...

1323
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:38,980
Oh, okay.

1324
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:39,500
Yeah.

1325
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,500
He'll be in the body bag right next to you.

1326
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:42,840
Oh, okay.

1327
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,940
I was gonna say like...

1328
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,880
With everybody can see it in the open.

1329
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,840
What am I gonna say?

1330
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,700
Like, everybody's gonna see me chuck a fucking body in the car.

1331
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,840
I feel like it's not...

1332
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,860
Oh, did I break something?

1333
01:00:59,260 --> 01:00:59,860
Shattered...

1334
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,360
Or...

1335
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,080
If you want to avoid access shadowing, you should use a sponge.

1336
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:03,840
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1337
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,140
Everything's already broken.

1338
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,220
Yeah, nobody's gonna suspect a thing.

1339
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:08,840
Okay.

1340
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,380
Alright, nice.

1341
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,300
Just gotta make sure that's okay.

1342
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,280
We'll do the trash last.

1343
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,600
I need to get rid of the body first.

1344
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:21,920
Okay.

1345
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,460
Alright, put that away.

1346
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,080
And then we're gonna put you...

1347
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,940
Put you in my trunk.

1348
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,160
Don't worry, nobody will remember you.

1349
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,220
And I'm gonna find where Cathy lives.

1350
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,740
So I'll tie up all loose ends.

1351
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,200
Do not worry.

1352
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,920
Or I'm just gonna make her forget about you.

1353
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,500
Don't worry.

1354
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,100
Cathy is gonna be so lonely.

1355
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,100
But she won't be lonely when I find her.

1356
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,420
I'm quite a charmer, you know?

1357
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,360
Alright, let's see.

1358
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,260
Into the truck you go.

1359
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:02,920
Alright.

1360
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,600
Into the truck you go.

1361
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,580
Yeah, I know.

1362
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,960
One more body up there.

1363
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,960
I still need to throw the...

1364
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,840
I need to throw the trash away, though.

1365
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:13,920
Okay.

1366
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,860
That's creepy.

1367
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,500
What is?

1368
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,620
I was just gonna comfort her.

1369
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,220
She's gonna be a widow.

1370
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,180
So, like, we gotta show some compassion.

1371
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,640
Where is the other body?

1372
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,680
Where did I put the other...

1373
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,300
Oh, there she is.

1374
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,280
Alright.

1375
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,660
Get up here.

1376
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,200
Alright.

1377
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,340
Like, who is...

1378
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,300
Do I get paid a lot of money for this?

1379
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,580
I must have.

1380
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,140
I mean, if, like, I'm here to clean up the evidence...

1381
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:46,020
I must get a lot of money for doing this.

1382
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,640
That's pretty low, Jokey.

1383
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:50,800
What?

1384
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,140
She's gonna be so sad.

1385
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,840
I'm just gonna be cheering her up.

1386
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,520
I'm gonna make sure she's gonna have a good time.

1387
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,820
And forget about her deadbeat ex.

1388
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,240
That totally left her.

1389
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,260
I'm gonna be there.

1390
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,260
I was like, yeah.

1391
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,380
Jeremy told me...

1392
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,000
Oh, God.

1393
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,100
Okay, we gotta get over there.

1394
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,200
Get over...

1395
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,180
Try it.

1396
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:15,900
Oh!

1397
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:16,920
I'm sorry!

1398
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,200
I'll be like, yeah, your deadbeat ex left you.

1399
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,780
What a fucking asshole.

1400
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,380
Oh, my God.

1401
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:24,720
Sorry.

1402
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,200
I'm playing...

1403
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,980
I'm playing basketball right now.

1404
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,320
I'll just be like, I'm so sorry.

1405
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,140
I can't believe he would leave you like this.

1406
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:41,780
He was...

1407
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,020
I saw him with another woman.

1408
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,080
And then he was like, yeah, Kathy will never know.

1409
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,280
And that's why I'm here to tell you, Kathy, that you deserve so much better.

1410
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,200
Anyway, don't go looking for him.

1411
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,520
He already left to the town next over.

1412
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,320
And he said, like, he already left.

1413
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,060
Oh, hey, money.

1414
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,160
At least he didn't screw me over.

1415
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,000
Oh, my God.

1416
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,520
That's a lot of $100 bill.

1417
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,080
From, like, the devil's lettuce?

1418
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,960
That's so much money.

1419
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,200
I thought it's like...

1420
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,780
I thought they had dispensaries in America.

1421
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,700
Bum, bum, ba-dum.

1422
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,060
Bum, bum, ba-dum.

1423
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,920
But Kathy will believe me.

1424
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,640
I know I'm a stranger, but she's gonna believe me.

1425
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,180
Okay, we're gonna throw away this trash.

1426
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,080
Where is the trash?

1427
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,920
Oh, I guess, like, I have to put it in my...

1428
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,260
She will.

1429
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,140
She will.

1430
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,760
I'm just gonna have to...

1431
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:43,060
I'm gonna do, like, that thing in that old movie where, like, people, they use, like, a dead body to pretend he's alive and take, like, lots of pictures.

1432
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,400
I'll just use that.

1433
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:45,860
I'll just put...

1434
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,720
I'll use that dead body.

1435
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,560
Clean it up.

1436
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,800
Put him in nicer clothes.

1437
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,200
Put him next to the other...

1438
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,680
The women dead body.

1439
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,120
Two women dead bodies.

1440
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:57,740
And then, like, put them together and take pictures with them together.

1441
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,760
And be like, look at these pictures.

1442
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,100
I found him at the bar with these two ladies.

1443
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:02,900
Yeah!

1444
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:03,720
The Bernie!

1445
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:04,460
Yeah!

1446
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,860
We can have Bernies!

1447
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,640
And then I'll dress them up, like, in nicer clothes.

1448
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,520
Clean them up so there's no blood or anything.

1449
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,720
And then just be like, I can't believe he would do this to you.

1450
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,160
You deserve so much better.

1451
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,620
Okay, that's fine.

1452
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,240
Is there anything more blood here?

1453
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,500
Oh, that's where I spilled the water.

1454
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,320
Okay, we're gonna clean this area, too.

1455
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,400
And that handprint.

1456
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,200
I think that's it, right?

1457
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,740
Okay, and this, too.

1458
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,860
Okay, and then we just gotta...

1459
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,480
Oh, shit!

1460
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:33,860
Okay.

1461
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,140
I gotta put stuff away.

1462
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,980
So that's here.

1463
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,120
Um, we're hang...

1464
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:45,420
We're gonna hang that back so that everything is where it's supposed to be.

1465
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,060
And then...

1466
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,200
Where is this?

1467
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,640
Okay, that's here.

1468
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,180
Okay, and then...

1469
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,500
That's here.

1470
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,140
Oh, shit.

1471
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,440
We gotta put the pillow away, too.

1472
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,480
Put this here.

1473
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,580
How did I know that's where things are?

1474
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,080
Cleaning comes before fixing?

1475
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,700
But there's nothing to clean here.

1476
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:06,820
What do you mean?

1477
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:07,920
There's literally nothing here.

1478
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,560
Okay, wipe all the blood.

1479
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:12,860
But there's nothing here.

1480
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,940
It's just a little blood.

1481
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,140
What is there to be worried about?

1482
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,760
Just a little blood.

1483
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,360
They're not gonna...

1484
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,760
They're not gonna look that much into it.

1485
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,900
What are they, cops?

1486
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:35,760
Like, if there's blood in my apartment right now, I wouldn't notice it if it's, like, a little bit of blood.

1487
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,420
Like, who pays attention to that?

1488
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,560
Like...

1489
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,860
What do you mean?

1490
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,300
Okay, check your...

1491
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,600
Alright, get a UV light right now and check if, like...

1492
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,500
See if you actually notice if there's a little blood.

1493
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,540
I bet you won't.

1494
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,160
I bet you won't notice the tiny blood you have.

1495
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:58,600
Oh, hey.

1496
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,160
Yeah.

1497
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,940
I mean, like, how are they gonna know?

1498
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,720
Crime scene investigation...

1499
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,260
Who's gonna report this crime?

1500
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:10,840
Like...

1501
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,840
Who's gonna know that he went to buy the devil?

1502
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,380
Devil's lettuce.

1503
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,760
Oh, Kathy.

1504
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,440
Okay, but, like, if we get Kathy out of the picture, who's gonna know?

1505
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:25,020
If we get Kathy out of the picture, nobody will know.

1506
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,300
We already committed three murders.

1507
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,720
What's one more to go?

1508
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,060
They never caught the Zodiac Killer.

1509
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,600
You think they're gonna catch me?

1510
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,460
They never catch the Zodiac Killer.

1511
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,060
They won't catch me.

1512
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:45,280
Bro, just leave Kathy alone.

1513
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,520
What are you gonna do to Kathy?

1514
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:49,960
They...

1515
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,480
No, they didn't.

1516
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,080
Who's the Zodiac Killer?

1517
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,440
Who is he?

1518
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,540
You guys don't know.

1519
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,740
Wait, don't...

1520
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,340
They'll never get...

1521
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,260
They'll never get...

1522
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,360
They'll never know.

1523
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,040
That's because the Zodiac Killer was smart.

1524
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,040
The Zodiac Killer did not stream their crime.

1525
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:11,320
The Zodiac Killer is smart.

1526
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,180
Why did they get him?

1527
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,320
Why did nobody tell me they got the Zodiac Killer?

1528
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,760
I feel like that's so important.

1529
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,480
Pennywise, two boxes of K.

1530
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,240
What is this?

1531
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:25,560
Nothing.

1532
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,620
This motherfucker still owes me 5k.

1533
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,780
Oh, he...

1534
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,620
No, he sells more than just the Devil's Lettuce.

1535
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,660
I assume, like, 3Gs a C is like...

1536
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,180
Did you guys see that on Twitter?

1537
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,040
Where people were, like, like, I don't know.

1538
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,460
Like, was it smoking?

1539
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,960
Does... wait, what was it?

1540
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:49,240
They were trying to justify doing, like, Cs.

1541
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,360
But, like, doing the powder?

1542
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:57,340
Yeah, somebody, people on Twitter were trying to justify doing the powder.

1543
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,560
And saying, like, the powder, like, Coke Zero does more damage.

1544
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:13,680
It's like, people were like, guys, Coke Zero does more damage than actual powder.

1545
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,680
And people were like, no?

1546
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,060
They're like, let some girls have fun.

1547
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,220
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1548
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,400
Where did you learn that fact?

1549
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,720
Yeah, it got community noted.

1550
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,660
Like...

1551
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,640
It got... it got community noted.

1552
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,160
Because people were like, that's not true.

1553
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:44,360
Like, Angel, thank you for the one gift and chip.

1554
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,600
Thank you, thank you.

1555
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,700
I was like, where did you get that information?

1556
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:52,620
Alright.

1557
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:56,860
Okay, that should be clean now.

1558
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:57,920
Alright.

1559
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,620
Onto the table you go.

1560
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,060
And then you are here.

1561
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,180
And then... you're here.

1562
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,580
And then the chair is here.

1563
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,260
They're... they're... they're...

1564
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,620
Okay, where does this table go?

1565
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,480
Wait, where does this table go?

1566
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,980
Oh, it's over here.

1567
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,660
I mean, he lives in a nice area.

1568
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,860
Like, his own apartment is nice.

1569
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,660
It's just the outside is pretty fucked.

1570
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,780
I guess he wants to be, like, non...

1571
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:39,880
Like, what... the most surprising part about this entire building is that the bathroom has... is actually pretty decent.

1572
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,400
Okay, never mind.

1573
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,020
Never mind.

1574
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,360
It's... he has a washing machine in his bathroom.

1575
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,840
That's kind of a little freaky.

1576
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,400
Uh, I take it back.

1577
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,460
That's a little freaky.

1578
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,880
That's... that's a little freaky.

1579
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,880
Oh, hey, five dollars.

1580
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:54,940
Oh, a hundred dollars.

1581
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:55,560
That's nice.

1582
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,680
Overcoming... Oh, he has anger issues.

1583
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,860
How to deal with your violent urges.

1584
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,180
Overcoming aggression.

1585
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,720
Oh my god, speaking of, like, violent urge... I don't have violent urges.

1586
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,740
But speaking of violent urges, I was, like, reading up on T.J.

1587
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:11,060
Miller.

1588
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,800
Oh, you guys know who T.J.

1589
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,280
Miller is?

1590
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:20,140
He's a guy who was in Silicon Valley and, like, um, he used to be in Deadpool or something.

1591
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:24,380
And apparently he's, like, super hard to work with.

1592
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,260
Um, because... because I was, like, wait, what happened to that guy?

1593
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,760
He was everywhere and then he was nowhere.

1594
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,520
Because I was curious.

1595
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:36,460
I was, like, he used to be, like, so famous and you would see him everywhere.

1596
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,540
And then suddenly he, like, disappeared and everything.

1597
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,240
And then I was, like, I was reading up on him.

1598
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:49,240
Because, like, apparently, um, he, like, he had an argument with a lady on a train.

1599
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,560
And then he had, like, he had, like, a breakdown.

1600
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,300
He had, like, a psychosis breakdown.

1601
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,720
And called a bomb threat on the train.

1602
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,760
So, obviously, all the movie companies fucking dropped him.

1603
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,340
Because they're, like, holy shit, that's fucked.

1604
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:12,100
But, like, it's apparently it's also because he has, like, um, he has, like, brain damage.

1605
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,740
That was discovered in 2010.

1606
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,920
So he would, he has, like, bipolar.

1607
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,620
But, like, only the manic episodes are bipolar.

1608
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,380
So he doesn't have, like...

1609
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,220
The other stuff from it.

1610
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,400
But, like, he has, like, the, like, the, the manic episodes and stuff.

1611
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,960
So I was, like, holy shit.

1612
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,740
And so he, like, lost, like, a lot of his, like, the job.

1613
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,280
Like, he's a really good actor.

1614
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:45,960
But, like, yeah, he had, like, um, he had, like, um, an issue with one of the lobes in his brain.

1615
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,860
That caused him to have, like, manic episodes and stuff.

1616
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:49,560
Yeah.

1617
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,140
He's not very funny.

1618
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,320
He, he's really good at...

1619
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,920
Quote, unquote, acting like an asshole.

1620
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,260
But, like, in the end, he actually...

1621
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,240
He does...

1622
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,060
He is, like, an asshole.

1623
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,360
But it's not, like, his fault.

1624
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:03,260
Um...

1625
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,700
So it was, like, so fucked.

1626
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,160
Because I was, like, he used to be in, like, everywhere, too.

1627
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,420
He used to be, like, in, like, so many things.

1628
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,020
Like, he was in Big Hero 6.

1629
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,240
He was big...

1630
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,620
He was in Big Hero 6.

1631
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,580
And he was in, like, uh...

1632
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:20,340
He was, like, in How to Train Your Dragon, Silicon Valley, Deadpool.

1633
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,700
And then suddenly he was in nothing.

1634
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,360
And I was, like, whoa.

1635
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,640
Like, what the fuck happened to him?

1636
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,360
I was, like, that's so interesting.

1637
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,080
And his mom...

1638
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,980
Okay, the most interesting part is that his mom is a psychologist, too.

1639
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,580
So I was, like, holy...

1640
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,700
I was, like...

1641
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,480
I was, like, oh, my God.

1642
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:43,020
He has, like, so many resources, too, to, like, help him.

1643
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:43,560
It's really...

1644
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,160
He recently made a Reddit post on, like...

1645
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,800
Like, a Reddit post AMA.

1646
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,480
And he was, like, yeah, like, I'm working really hard.

1647
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,780
With my psycholo...

1648
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,700
Like, psychologists and, like, therapy and everything.

1649
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,100
So he is getting the help, which is nice to see.

1650
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,160
I was, like...

1651
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,700
It was so, like, interesting, though.

1652
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:08,560
Because, like, it's really interesting what, like, marketing and, like, what the public perception is can affect the story.

1653
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,160
Because I was reading how people were, like, thinking he was just, like, an incredibly huge asshole.

1654
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,680
And was, like...

1655
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,040
Was, like, oh, yeah, no, people hate working with him and stuff.

1656
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,540
Like, Ryan Reynolds fucking hate him.

1657
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,640
And that's why he got dropped for Deadpool...

1658
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,060
Uh, Deadpool 3.

1659
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,180
And I was, like...

1660
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,860
Because he was in Deadpool 1 and 2.

1661
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,820
But he wasn't in...

1662
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:31,400
But they literally forgot about him in Deadpool 3.

1663
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,780
And so I was, like...

1664
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,400
So I was, like, oh, what happened to him?

1665
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,220
And then, apparently, it was not even his fault.

1666
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,280
It's just because...

1667
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,700
It's just because he just has, like...

1668
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,160
He literally can't help it.

1669
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:46,440
Whoops.

1670
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:49,840
Uh...

1671
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,140
Here we go.

1672
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,500
But, yeah, people were saying he's, like, super hard to work with.

1673
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,100
What is your Twitter timeline?

1674
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:01,840
Okay...

1675
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,580
I played...

1676
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,620
Thank you for the super chat.

1677
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,700
Thank you, thank you.

1678
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,820
Okay, that didn't come up on my Twitter.

1679
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,100
I was just super curious.

1680
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,240
I was, like, what happened to TJ Miller?

1681
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,360
Like...

1682
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,520
I was just curious.

1683
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,680
I looked it up.

1684
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,840
Because I was, like, what the fuck happened to that guy?

1685
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,740
I think that's it, right?

1686
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,200
Did I fix everything?

1687
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,160
It's, like, nothing bad happened here.

1688
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,440
Oh, the other subject?

1689
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:33,140
Which one?

1690
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,760
I went through so many different subjects.

1691
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:41,960
Which...

1692
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,860
Which one?

1693
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,680
You gotta be specific here.

1694
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,460
One...

1695
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,780
One evidence and one furniture.

1696
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,760
And I'm trying to figure out which one is it.

1697
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,660
Where's the last furniture?

1698
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,880
I feel like everything is, like, where it's supposed to be.

1699
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:10,710
Oh, the Diet Coke?

1700
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:11,230
What?

1701
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,210
It's cause, like...

1702
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:13,330
People were, like...

1703
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,250
Please...

1704
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:15,750
People were, like...

1705
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:18,930
Please do not listen to this random Twitter person that says...

1706
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,790
Coke Zero is worse than...

1707
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:23,610
They're, like...

1708
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:25,250
Drugs are still bad.

1709
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,390
No matter what.

1710
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,390
Do not...

1711
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:31,170
Just because...

1712
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,390
Just because they seem quirky...

1713
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,510
Doesn't mean that they're right.

1714
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:38,070
I was just, like...

1715
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,990
Holy shit.

1716
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,670
That's so fucking...

1717
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,030
That's so fucking crazy.

1718
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:46,630
I was, like...

1719
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:46,830
What?

1720
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:47,830
Oh, there it is.

1721
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:48,910
The fucking...

1722
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,210
I thought that this was supposed to be there.

1723
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:51,750
Like...

1724
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:58,790
That thought process needs to be studied.

1725
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,970
Thank you for the super chat.

1726
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:01,430
Thank you.

1727
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,130
Thank you.

1728
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,890
Twitter is a very interesting place.

1729
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:06,690
It's a very...

1730
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,290
It's very interesting.

1731
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:09,310
What evidence?

1732
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:10,670
What kind of ev...

1733
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:10,850
Oh.

1734
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,670
What kind of evidence do I need?

1735
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,070
I feel like I collected everything.

1736
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:19,170
Like...

1737
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:21,150
How can he get even more crazy?

1738
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,010
Is it in the attic?

1739
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:25,570
Okay.

1740
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,390
Let's check the attic real fast.

1741
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:30,870
All right.

1742
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:34,590
Like, what other crazy shit do you have up here?

1743
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:38,250
Bum, bum.

1744
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:38,830
Okay.

1745
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:39,930
That's a ladder.

1746
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,630
Is there anything here?

1747
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:44,130
Oh.

1748
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:45,570
Nice.

1749
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:47,950
Nice.

1750
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:48,250
Okay.

1751
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,250
We need that, actually.

1752
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,990
What's this?

1753
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,770
Oh, okay.

1754
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:53,550
Those are...

1755
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:53,590
Oh.

1756
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:53,870
There's more...

1757
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:54,410
Oh, there's more...

1758
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,610
More devil's lettuce.

1759
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:57,850
All right.

1760
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:58,670
Anything else?

1761
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,090
Oh, nice.

1762
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:01,430
More.

1763
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:03,850
Guys, I know a guy.

1764
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,570
Is there anything else here?

1765
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:09,030
I guess there's like power tools, TV.

1766
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,190
I feel like that's everything.

1767
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:12,890
Oh, there it is.

1768
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,090
Oh, it's her.

1769
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:17,510
Tabitha Coons.

1770
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:19,070
Simmons University.

1771
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:21,450
Replacement fee.

1772
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,590
Well, Tabitha's not gonna need it.

1773
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:24,110
I don't need this anymore.

1774
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,070
Yay!

1775
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,550
I can sell this ID.

1776
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:33,790
Alright, now for... I might as well get some identity theft going along too.

1777
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:35,650
Alright.

1778
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,270
I think we're good.

1779
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,570
It's like nobody was here.

1780
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,170
I mean like, you might as well fully commit.

1781
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,590
You already commit so many crimes.

1782
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:49,590
Why stop now?

1783
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,110
Why stop now?

1784
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,970
Kill the rabbit.

1785
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:57,350
Kill the rabbit.

1786
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,670
Kill the rabbit.

1787
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:03,250
Are you sure you will not be able to continue cleaning?

1788
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,950
Yeah, alright.

1789
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,130
Alright, we can go now.

1790
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,030
Yay!

1791
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,330
We did our job!

1792
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,990
Yeah, we can't end it on a lame crime.

1793
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:14,650
We gotta...

1794
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:17,150
We gotta fully commit.

1795
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:21,880
Look at that.

1796
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:22,620
100%.

1797
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,360
I'm really good.

1798
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,040
I'm a natural.

1799
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,400
Someone can say I'm a natural.

1800
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,480
What is this?

1801
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Oh my god.

1802
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,400
This might be my calling.

1803
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,040
I should quit and become a crime scene leader.

1804
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,200
Okay, nice.

1805
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,400
I stole...

1806
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:48,980
It's not stealing.

1807
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,040
It's like...

1808
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,020
Rent, you know?

1809
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:52,660
Like...

1810
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,580
I'm just taking extra taxes.

1811
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,260
It's like a donation.

1812
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,640
My super chat.

1813
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,180
Oh, there's two other cassette tapes.

1814
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,460
Wait, there were secrets?

1815
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,160
What kind of secrets were there?

1816
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,220
You like Disney sing-along songs?

1817
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,780
Their early work was a little too new way for my taste.

1818
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:19,540
But when the Little Mermaid came out, I think they really came into our own commercially and artistically.

1819
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,420
Yeah, and then like the 2020...

1820
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:26,360
2015 happened and then it just went downhill.

1821
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,920
What is the secret?

1822
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,240
I looked straight at the secret.

1823
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,240
Wait, but what could it be?

1824
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,780
Wait, what are the secrets though?

1825
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,120
Oh, I can open my skill tree.

1826
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,140
It's not stealing.

1827
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,040
It's collecting.

1828
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,700
Let's see.

1829
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,440
Oh, it's hitting rooms?

1830
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,760
What the fuck is that sound?

1831
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,020
What is...

1832
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,340
What is that sound?

1833
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,820
What the fuck is that sound?

1834
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,840
Oh my god, it's getting louder.

1835
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,040
Oh my... Oh fuck, that's a dog.

1836
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:15,280
Okay, I was like...

1837
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,940
Okay, I don't know what that sound is.

1838
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:23,640
What is clapping cheeks right now?

1839
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,320
What is it?

1840
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,840
Oh wait, I don't want to increase... Okay, mop.

1841
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,860
Strength increases mop ability.

1842
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,840
Clean difficulty.

1843
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,960
Oh wait, I want the 20... Okay, we're gonna grab that.

1844
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,860
And then cleaning speed, we'll have that.

1845
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,260
What are tools do I have?

1846
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,320
Increased capacity.

1847
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,180
An additional lamp.

1848
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,600
I feel like we don't really need that.

1849
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,500
Okay, we need more water.

1850
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,320
A job like that probably wouldn't work for you.

1851
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,080
People nearby would be like, what is that laugh?

1852
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,280
Nowhere!

1853
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,860
Thank you for the super chat.

1854
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:56,920
Thank you, thank you.

1855
01:21:59,300 --> 01:21:59,860
Okay.

1856
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:01,740
Yes, save.

1857
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,860
Oh my god, the clapping.

1858
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:05,100
Please stop.

1859
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,880
Stop the clapping, please.

1860
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,760
Go grab this.

1861
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,220
Oh, can I do...

1862
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,580
Sponges get stained.

1863
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,000
Okay, I feel like...

1864
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,820
I feel like the stain is better.

1865
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,040
Oh my god, please.

1866
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,180
I'm going fucking crazy.

1867
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,200
I'm going...

1868
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,540
I'm going fucking...

1869
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,440
I'm going crazy with this.

1870
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,400
Please.

1871
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,220
Okay.

1872
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,240
Pressure, water, increased strength.

1873
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,580
Pressure, strength.

1874
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,100
Okay, maybe a difficult...

1875
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,300
Obviously the coverage would be better though.

1876
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,020
Okay.

1877
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,640
Oh my god, please stop.

1878
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:49,180
Please.

1879
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:49,940
Please.

1880
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,100
What's...

1881
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:53,660
What!

1882
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,440
Is it me?

1883
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,260
Is it me?

1884
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,760
It's like...

1885
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:08,500
It's like that famous story where you can hear the heartbeat from the fucking floor, from the underneath the...

1886
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,300
like floor, because it's like you're Sin or whatever.

1887
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,760
And it's just...

1888
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:17,960
Dear Mr. Kovalosky, I hope this message finds you well.

1889
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,160
I'm writing a friend update on your phone.

1890
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:21,600
Oh, I'm doing this for my daughter!

1891
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,500
An extended pyramid.

1892
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:24,640
The crow, yeah.

1893
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:26,140
The telltale heart.

1894
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,100
Please.

1895
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,040
Please.

1896
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,320
Where's the phone?

1897
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:43,670
That's cute.

1898
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:54,130
Never more book club.

1899
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:58,010
Me?!

1900
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,370
This is my dad cave?

1901
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,270
Oh my god, I got the job!

1902
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:12,290
I passed!

1903
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,010
Guys, I passed!

1904
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,990
Guys!

1905
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,510
I did it!

1906
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:18,330
I passed the job!

1907
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:19,130
Oh, it's done.

1908
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:20,230
I knew it after.

1909
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:21,850
Okay, it's not as bad now.

1910
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:24,110
I knew, I knew I wasn't guilty.

1911
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:26,350
I was just doing my job.

1912
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:32,170
Guys, I know the music doesn't sound like great, but like I was doing my job.

1913
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:36,410
Look, I can change the atmosphere like instantly.

1914
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:39,470
Classical music, but happy.

1915
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:43,770
There you go.

1916
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,850
I can change the feel.

1917
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,250
I did it.

1918
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:49,470
I did a good job.

1919
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:51,710
Yay!

1920
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:57,430
You truly are a God's gift to all fucknuts like me.

1921
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:58,990
I'm not a bad person.

1922
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:00,930
Definitely not a natural born killer.

1923
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:02,170
But that asshole caught me off guard.

1924
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,010
It was either him or me.

1925
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:05,190
But I found the women!

1926
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:10,690
Honestly, I hope you found the envelope and you're not mad that to make a swift...

1927
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:11,990
Like, I found the women!

1928
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:13,470
You can't just say that!

1929
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:14,570
I...

1930
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:17,510
Is that NordVPN?

1931
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:18,110
Wait, is it?

1932
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,750
No, it's been only five years since your wife passed away.

1933
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:25,350
But truly terrible weather combined with air pollution sped up the weathering of tombstones.

1934
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:28,830
I can offer you a 20% discount for your wife's grave restoration.

1935
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:30,730
It'll only be $320.

1936
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,890
It's a bargain, believe me.

1937
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:34,090
Oh my God.

1938
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:34,810
Wait, that...

1939
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:40,370
Wait, I can just call that lady that does, like, grave cleaning and she'll do it for free for content.

1940
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:45,330
Why do I need to pay you when I can pay that...

1941
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,410
Oh, it is NordVPN.

1942
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:51,370
I can pay that YouTube lady to, like, clean my wife's grave for free.

1943
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:55,210
And I'll just be like, you can fucking make content out of it.

1944
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:55,710
I don't care.

1945
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:57,570
You make more content out of it.

1946
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,050
Maybe people will, like...

1947
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:01,870
More people will show up to clean my wife's grave.

1948
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,610
She even less sponsored.

1949
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:08,870
Alright, let's see.

1950
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:09,690
Okay, where am I?

1951
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:10,850
Go to bed?

1952
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:11,850
Where's my bed?

1953
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:14,570
Where's my bedroom?

1954
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:16,510
Oh, there it is.

1955
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,330
No, that's the bathroom.

1956
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:19,810
This is... Oh, that's sad.

1957
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:21,410
This is my child's room.

1958
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:23,370
She is seriously ill.

1959
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:24,430
Oh, no.

1960
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:24,750
Oh, no.

1961
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:26,930
Oh, no.

1962
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:29,810
At least she has a job.

1963
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,530
Oh, and she wants to be an astronaut.

1964
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:34,710
Oh, that's so sad.

1965
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:36,330
She's sick.

1966
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,290
Where do I sleep?

1967
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:41,610
Is this my bed?

1968
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:45,110
Open up.

1969
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:46,330
Open up.

1970
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,030
What am I hiding in that bedroom?

1971
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:51,750
Where the fuck do I sleep?

1972
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:52,670
Oh, there it is.

1973
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:55,030
What the fuck is in there, then?

1974
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:56,730
Alright.

1975
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,070
Oh, there's my dead wife.

1976
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,790
Those are the hospital bills I have to pay.

1977
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:02,730
And then...

1978
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:06,070
This is my beer when I drink away my problems.

1979
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:07,610
Okay, that makes sense.

1980
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:10,510
Alright, now I see the story of this game.

1981
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:14,990
Now I understand.

1982
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,450
Mike's spa and wellness.

1983
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:19,330
What if that motherfucker finds out?

1984
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:21,790
No worries, pals.

1985
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:24,550
He's too dumb to suspect that...

1986
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,770
I'll do anything for money.

1987
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:27,110
Beer o'clock.

1988
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:30,350
Just don't you get out of delay, small one gentleman.

1989
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,340
What?

1990
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,720
Why would I question anything?

1991
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,500
If they'll pay me lots of money.

1992
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,740
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, you know?

1993
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:48,260
Whoa.

1994
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,920
Death to traitors.

1995
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:51,500
Whoa.

1996
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,600
Oh, shit.

1997
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,780
Oh, hey, look.

1998
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,920
Some free rubber duckies for my sick daughter.

1999
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:04,320
The moment I clean these rubber duckies, she's gonna love it.

2000
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,680
Oh, hey, scrub daddy.

2001
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:15,550
Alright.

2002
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,530
Alright, time to change up the music.

2003
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:19,210
Alright, guys.

2004
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:20,710
Let's see.

2005
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:22,230
Look, this is important.

2006
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:25,350
I can't just...

2007
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:26,470
I can't just stop.

2008
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:29,110
Give me a sec.

2009
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:31,690
Relaxing Super Mario Jazz covers.

2010
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:33,470
There we go.

2011
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,330
Alright, where's my phone?

2012
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:41,290
Oh, no, the clacking is back.

2013
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,250
Oh, shit, you're right.

2014
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:45,950
Minecraft music.

2015
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:50,230
Minecraft music.

2016
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,070
Minecraft music.

2017
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:55,670
Minecraft music.

2018
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:56,150
Minecraft music.

2019
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:58,250
Minecraft music.

2020
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:00,950
I'm impressed by what she did in his apartment.

2021
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:01,870
Yeah.

2022
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:02,890
Thank you.

2023
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:03,290
Better.

2024
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:10,820
Stop dreaming for me or I'll have someone else wiping your blood off my shoes.

2025
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,670
I mean, it's pretty fair.

2026
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:18,870
...to working for the biggest crime boss in the city.

2027
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:20,530
Did you hear that?

2028
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:21,730
We're gonna be rich!

2029
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:23,990
Working for a crime boss?

2030
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:26,530
Nothing ever bad happens to those people.

2031
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:27,470
Right?

2032
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:28,990
Forget about it.

2033
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:29,730
Hahaha.

2034
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:33,390
They even made a popular cartoon show about it.

2035
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,450
Where they forget about it.

2036
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:37,430
And then it got cancelled.

2037
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:41,590
But other than the cancelled part, it seemed pretty great.

2038
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,830
Okay, bad call.

2039
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:44,480
Oh, five thousand...

2040
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:48,090
Okay, five thousand dollars just to fucking clean bot.

2041
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:48,690
That's...

2042
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:49,910
Okay, that's a little too cheap though.

2043
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:50,610
I'm not gonna...

2044
01:29:53,710 --> 01:30:00,410
Okay, I'm gonna say, like, five thousand dollars is way too cheap for cleaning fucking bodies.

2045
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:03,230
Like, it should be, like, at least...

2046
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:04,970
At least ten grand!

2047
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:07,190
Like, five thousand dollars?

2048
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:08,150
Like...

2049
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,930
Oh, true.

2050
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:13,030
No taxes.

2051
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:13,810
That's true.

2052
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:15,750
There isn't any taxes.

2053
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:16,910
So, like, that's the benefit.

2054
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:21,470
Alright.

2055
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:23,530
Yeah, that barely...

2056
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:25,130
That pays for, like, one month...

2057
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:26,370
Like, almost one...

2058
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:28,270
Okay, one month of rent and groceries.

2059
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:31,830
Like, I might as well work at, like, fat...

2060
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,670
Like, fast food.

2061
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:40,950
And then, like, it's unmarked bills too.

2062
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:42,750
So, then I have to figure out how to fuck...

2063
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,570
How the fuck to use this cash.

2064
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,070
Like, legally.

2065
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:47,570
If it's unmarked.

2066
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:50,550
Okay.

2067
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:51,510
Collect...

2068
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:51,730
Oh, wait.

2069
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:51,930
I...

2070
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:52,610
Wrong level.

2071
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,270
I did this again.

2072
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:53,630
Whoops.

2073
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:54,930
Uh...

2074
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,030
Oh, no.

2075
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:57,270
Uh...

2076
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:58,430
Abandon mission.

2077
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,210
I went to the wrong...

2078
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:02,950
I went to the wrong place.

2079
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,510
Okay.

2080
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:04,490
We're gonna skip that.

2081
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:08,070
Oh, no one wondered.

2082
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,250
Okay.

2083
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:08,870
That...

2084
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:11,350
So, the first job was $5,000?

2085
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:13,270
Okay.

2086
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:15,170
Oh, I have to accept it in my...

2087
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:16,450
Um...

2088
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:17,410
In my computer.

2089
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:21,170
I'll never know what's making that fucking clack noise.

2090
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:23,770
It's my guilty conscience.

2091
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,310
Hey, dad.

2092
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:27,990
I know you're busy working, but I want to let you know how I'm doing.

2093
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:31,290
It's so weird living without you, but I'm slowly getting used to the place.

2094
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:32,750
We have normal classes.

2095
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,550
There are other kids my age, and some of them are really nice.

2096
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:36,630
There are...

2097
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,290
Uh...

2098
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:38,770
I think they even want to be friends.

2099
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:39,590
I even...

2100
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:42,910
Yes, it's not even as bad as I thought, but I really miss you.

2101
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,330
Yeah, I hope I can see...

2102
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:45,670
Oh, my dog is...

2103
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:46,350
Dexter.

2104
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:49,010
Your application for a loan was rejected.

2105
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:53,410
Sadly, with your current janitor salary, you don't qualify for any of our offers.

2106
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:54,250
No!

2107
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:56,610
Oh, $7,500?

2108
01:31:58,330 --> 01:31:58,810
Okay.

2109
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:01,310
$7,500 ain't so bad.

2110
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,050
It seems like a...

2111
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:03,810
Good job.

2112
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:05,250
All right.

2113
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:06,610
Now I can go to the car.

2114
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:08,050
All right, Dexter.

2115
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:12,590
Oh, there's no water in there.

2116
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:13,550
Let me...

2117
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:14,450
Whoops.

2118
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:14,990
Okay.

2119
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:16,330
I'm a little bit of a mess.

2120
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:16,870
All right.

2121
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:17,290
Don't worry.

2122
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:19,610
You'll find some stuff around to eat.

2123
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:22,230
I believe in you, Dexter.

2124
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,590
Oh, I should pet Dexter.

2125
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:26,010
Dexter, who's a good boy?

2126
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:28,250
How are you doing, Dexter?

2127
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:28,950
Yeah.

2128
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:30,670
Daddy started a criminal prison.

2129
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,290
Did you know I'm a criminal now, little boy?

2130
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:36,070
You're going to be so well fed.

2131
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:36,610
Oh, my God.

2132
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:36,730
A little bit.

2133
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:38,030
Don't worry.

2134
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:42,270
We might not have food now, but when I'm back, Dexter, we're going to have so much food.

2135
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,630
All right.

2136
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:45,050
Here we go.

2137
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:47,290
Trial by blood.

2138
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:49,510
Is this...

2139
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,650
That should be it.

2140
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:52,510
Okay.

2141
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:56,590
Okay.

2142
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:01,410
Nice.

2143
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,630
It'll be a long night.

2144
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,300
We'll be fine.

2145
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,420
Trial by blood.

2146
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,560
The man you never met.

2147
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:20,340
Oh!

2148
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,900
Wait, he killed his family?

2149
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,100
What did they do?

2150
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,400
I guess they betrayed him, right?

2151
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,680
Because it's like, traitor something something.

2152
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:32,860
I'm here!

2153
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:36,100
Yes?

2154
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,840
Hello.

2155
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,380
Hello, Mr. Cuff.

2156
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:45,690
I'm now taking charge of the place of inheritance from my cousin,

2157
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:54,700
Miss.

2158
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:56,700
But how many people did he kill?

2159
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:57,580
I'm getting down to work.

2160
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,100
That's what I like to hear.

2161
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,120
Okay, unraveling.

2162
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,500
The grand life-size Anubis statue.

2163
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,940
Impress your friends.

2164
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:10,600
Alright.

2165
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,000
Alright, it's cleaning time.

2166
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:15,940
Doing the thing I'm most well known for.

2167
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,420
Clean, clean, clean.

2168
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,540
Clean, clean, clean.

2169
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,440
Wait, is there like a...

2170
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,440
Oh, okay, the men's room.

2171
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,180
Alright, we're gonna clean this part.

2172
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:31,220
And then grab a bucket so I can...

2173
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:32,260
Where's my bucket?

2174
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,180
Where's my trash can?

2175
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,080
That's...

2176
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,200
Oh, what's this?

2177
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,580
Oh, this is my pressure washer.

2178
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,580
Okay, there we go.

2179
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,440
Alright, don't worry.

2180
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:45,780
Wait, is there a faucet nearby?

2181
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,140
Oh, there it is.

2182
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,720
Alright, I'm learning so much.

2183
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,380
I'm learning so much on how to be an optimal cleaner.

2184
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,880
Okay, I wonder where there's secrets here.

2185
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,160
Okay, where does this go?

2186
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:05,740
Okay, it goes here.

2187
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:07,640
It's not here?

2188
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:08,620
There we go.

2189
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,860
We'll just put this here for now.

2190
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,380
How convenient, yeah?

2191
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:14,460
Okay, detergent.

2192
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,100
Which one do I want to use?

2193
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:19,480
Get stain, increase tool abilities to clean...

2194
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,700
Okay, I feel like this is the better detergent.

2195
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,680
Alright, and then...

2196
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,460
Magic happens.

2197
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,100
There we go.

2198
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:30,640
Nice.

2199
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:36,200
I wonder if this is like... is this like bleached water or like regular?

2200
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,540
I guess it's regular water because there's detergent on here too.

2201
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:44,280
Okay, I gotta make sure I have no evidence of my footsteps and everything.

2202
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,660
And I'm wearing gloves!

2203
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,180
I'm such a professional.

2204
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:54,160
Okay, we gotta clean the jar a little bit and then...

2205
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,100
There we go.

2206
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,460
Yeah, it's Minecraft music.

2207
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,720
I feel like that's like the best way to clean.

2208
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,160
And then we'll sponge it up.

2209
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:03,640
There we go.

2210
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,140
It's like nothing bad ever happened.

2211
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:13,020
And then we're gonna put this here so people know we're a clean building.

2212
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,920
I mean, if you're gonna do a good job...

2213
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,000
We might as well...

2214
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,460
Okay, it's on the other side.

2215
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,420
If we're gonna do a good job, we have to...

2216
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,600
We have to have the perfect music.

2217
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,040
Oh, relaxation zone!

2218
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:30,640
Alright,

2219
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,320
let's get this out of the way.

2220
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,180
Make sure everything is okay.

2221
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,600
I mean, if we're gonna take over this business...

2222
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,420
Like, we gotta make sure that the customer...

2223
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,360
Knows that there's no red paint every...

2224
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,860
It's supposed to be a relaxing spa.

2225
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,880
A dirty spa is not relaxing.

2226
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:58,860
Not creepy.

2227
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,400
It's just cause there's no people here.

2228
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,520
Doesn't mean it's creepy.

2229
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,600
Look, see?

2230
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,240
Even the pool is Kool-Aid.

2231
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:07,500
That's pretty neat.

2232
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,140
Even have like Kool-Aid colored pools.

2233
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,280
Look at that.

2234
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,460
Good for them.

2235
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:15,620
Oop.

2236
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,200
I gotta make sure this is clean.

2237
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,060
Yeah, it's to die for.

2238
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:22,180
What flavor?

2239
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,100
Raspberry flavor, of course.

2240
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:24,960
It's Kool-Aid.

2241
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,420
Wait, whose phone is that?

2242
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,280
Slaps top of basketball.

2243
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,000
Is that fucking mean?

2244
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:45,900
I feel like it makes the swimming pool more fun if it's different colors.

2245
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,480
It's nice Halloween themed.

2246
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:54,920
Alright.

2247
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:58,440
With this pastor eating Mama Mia's make me sick.

2248
01:37:58,820 --> 01:37:59,980
Alright, nice.

2249
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,240
I mean, they deserve it.

2250
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:04,080
Like, literally.

2251
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:08,540
Like, why would you ever try to kill your boss?

2252
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,760
If you're gonna kill your boss, at least like get away with it.

2253
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,460
Dude.

2254
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:15,820
Hire...

2255
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:23,400
Never be the one to initiate to like suggest the killing to somebody else to do it.

2256
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,540
So this is what I would do hypothetically if I don't...

2257
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,960
If I wanna like, you know, attempting murder.

2258
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,860
Like, I would not...

2259
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:35,420
Obviously, I would not be the one to like try to be like, I wanna murder this person.

2260
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,500
You'd like...

2261
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:40,080
You like him to somebody else who also feels the same way.

2262
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,440
Like, you know, they feel similar.

2263
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,480
And then be like, yeah, he fucking sucks.

2264
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,700
Wouldn't it be funny if like, you know, if he was dead?

2265
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,680
But like, that's just so funny.

2266
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:51,440
Wouldn't it be?

2267
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,700
And then like, you know, get that thought and like implant that thought in his head.

2268
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,280
Like inception.

2269
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:57,840
But like IRL.

2270
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,660
So then you inception him.

2271
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:00,800
And then he'll...

2272
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,240
He'll be the one that tries to come up and be like, yeah, no, he fucking sucks too.

2273
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,740
Like, yeah, oh my god, he fucking sucks as well.

2274
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,020
And then so like, they'll think about it.

2275
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,820
And then, you know, they try to initiate a plan.

2276
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,460
And you're just like...

2277
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:22,520
And then, you know, when you find out that they try to do a murder, you'd be like, oh my god, how could Jimmy do that?

2278
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,400
I thought he was cool.

2279
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,940
I would never let that happen to you, boss.

2280
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,760
In Minecraft, of course.

2281
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,720
In Minecraft.

2282
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:42,890
I'm just saying, like...

2283
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:45,550
Like, the easiest way to get away...

2284
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:48,370
Is to just incept someone else to think...

2285
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:49,550
To do it.

2286
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:52,130
And then, like, you know, you don't have to be involved.

2287
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:55,550
It's all unhypothetical.

2288
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:57,150
That's why we have Minecraft music playing.

2289
01:39:57,390 --> 01:39:57,670
Yeah.

2290
01:39:58,370 --> 01:39:59,470
It's all in Minecraft.

2291
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:03,730
Okay, we gotta grab our fucking...

2292
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,570
Is there another...

2293
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:08,330
Oh, they got the Anubis!

2294
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:15,650
They got the Anubis statue!

2295
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:19,730
Hey, attention!

2296
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:22,910
Alright, let's clean this up.

2297
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:24,130
Oh yeah, we gotta get the...

2298
01:40:24,970 --> 01:40:26,030
Uh, detergent in.

2299
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:29,730
Alright.

2300
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,570
Let's put that...

2301
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:33,850
Let's make sure our mop has the detergent, too.

2302
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,170
How do I empty the pool?

2303
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:37,570
Is there, like, a...

2304
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:39,210
Is there, like, a button?

2305
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:42,770
Okay, well, I'll make sure he's clean.

2306
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:43,390
Alright.

2307
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:45,170
What if I just...

2308
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:46,010
Okay, you are...

2309
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:47,450
You're bothering me.

2310
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:50,170
Okay, we're gonna...

2311
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:54,690
Alright, we're gonna put all the bodies in here first.

2312
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:56,450
Cause, like, it's...

2313
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:58,330
It's very cluttered up right now.

2314
01:40:58,410 --> 01:40:59,570
So, we're gonna...

2315
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:02,450
We're gonna put you...

2316
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:04,730
We're just gonna put you in there.

2317
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,850
Cause you're cluttering it up a little bit.

2318
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:09,010
And I need to make sure...

2319
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:10,650
How do I...

2320
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:11,130
Wait.

2321
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,010
UV light.

2322
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:14,010
Why do I need to put UV light here?

2323
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:17,490
I mean, I could tell...

2324
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:18,870
I could see the blood.

2325
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:20,050
I don't need a UV light.

2326
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:23,810
Okay, so if I clean this, then, like...

2327
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:28,630
I can't cancel the membership.

2328
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:34,730
Why would you cancel, Tenjin?

2329
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:35,770
I don't understand.

2330
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:37,130
Aren't you a homie?

2331
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,110
Why would you do that?

2332
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:40,650
I'm here trying to clean.

2333
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:41,950
I'm here to do...

2334
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:46,050
Cleaning is so hard work and you're gonna cancel the membership?

2335
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:48,090
Think about my dog!

2336
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:49,430
Dexter!

2337
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,130
And Doki, my real dog.

2338
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:52,150
Think about my...

2339
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:53,130
No!

2340
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:55,650
This is your fault, Tenjin!

2341
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:58,070
Look at that!

2342
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:00,450
I fucking dropped my...

2343
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:04,250
Look at what you did!

2344
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:13,330
Now my hypothetical fake boss is gonna be so angry!

2345
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:15,550
Okay.

2346
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:15,910
Okay.

2347
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:16,030
Okay.

2348
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:18,450
Okay, it's all in the way.

2349
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:19,110
I can't clear the way first.

2350
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:20,110
It's not clear?

2351
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:22,690
What is in the way?

2352
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:25,010
You can't move like this.

2353
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:26,050
What do you...

2354
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:27,230
What's in the way?

2355
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,730
There's nothing in the way!

2356
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:31,150
What!

2357
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:32,630
Okay.

2358
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:33,630
Okay.

2359
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,310
Oh, it's like one wine bottle.

2360
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:39,850
One fucking wine bottle.

2361
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:40,710
Okay.

2362
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:48,570
Okay, let's just... Alright.

2363
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:53,150
It's okay, the water will clean the body up.

2364
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:57,470
Shit, let's put this over here.

2365
01:42:58,850 --> 01:42:59,530
Alright.

2366
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,270
Nice.

2367
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:05,310
Okay, now that... Oh shit, he's listening?

2368
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:13,100
Boss, Big Jim, I would never do that to you, Big Jim.

2369
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,060
Can I use the power washer?

2370
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:24,790
Okay, now the power washer fucking sucks.

2371
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:28,230
Yeah, this is his fault, honestly.

2372
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:32,570
Okay, the power washer is so bad, I actually don't like the power washer.

2373
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:37,870
I'm gonna... Wait, how do I put this away?

2374
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:38,890
Okay.

2375
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:42,130
Is this stronger now?

2376
01:43:42,410 --> 01:43:47,670
No, I feel like the power washer is not as good, I feel like.

2377
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:48,310
It's so slow.

2378
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:52,530
What's the nozzle change?

2379
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:54,470
Oh, I can just go that way.

2380
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:57,370
I mean, it's doing its job, I guess.

2381
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:01,230
Yeah, it sort of is doing its job.

2382
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:04,150
Everything sucks until it upgrades?

2383
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:05,630
That's gotta... I need funding.

2384
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:08,890
I need... That's why Big Jim believes in me.

2385
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:14,710
He's gonna fund my cleaning... He's gonna be funding my cleaning, um, adventures.

2386
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:18,150
And then I'm gonna be like the best janitor in the fucking city.

2387
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:21,310
Guys, I got a sponsor.

2388
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:22,810
Oh.

2389
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:25,970
How do I put this away, then?

2390
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:28,230
Uh...

2391
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:32,090
How do I put this away?

2392
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:34,830
Guys... Oh, there it is.

2393
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:36,090
Okay, back to mob.

2394
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:37,650
Mob time.

2395
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:39,650
Oh, no.

2396
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:41,350
Okay, we gotta go back to the bucket.

2397
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:44,450
Alright.

2398
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:46,770
Clean up.

2399
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:51,070
Okay, I gotta clean up the mess I made because of Tenjin.

2400
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:52,110
I got...

2401
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:55,790
It's just out of water?

2402
01:44:56,030 --> 01:45:01,230
Yeah, but I feel like... I feel like the mob is stronger than the... I don't know.

2403
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:04,330
I feel like the mob was just better than the, uh...

2404
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:06,130
than the pressure for now.

2405
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:07,590
Because the mob feels stronger.

2406
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:10,510
Okay.

2407
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:11,530
Clean, clean, clean.

2408
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:13,930
I could add more water to it now.

2409
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:16,250
There we go.

2410
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:17,570
Oh, I did it!

2411
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:18,850
Alright, might as well.

2412
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:20,990
I mean, I do have it, so I might as well.

2413
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:22,110
I gotta learn!

2414
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:28,450
I gotta learn this new technology that all the... all the hip, uh... all the hip janitors use now.

2415
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:31,370
I mean, it works, I guess.

2416
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:34,390
Oh, I need to clean my footsteps too.

2417
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:38,330
All the new janitors are using these new thingy technology.

2418
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:40,290
Like the pressure washer.

2419
01:45:40,730 --> 01:45:43,510
So I might as well, like, get on with the times.

2420
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:45,330
Yeah, I gotta get on with the times.

2421
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:48,210
I can't just... I can't just always use my hands.

2422
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:50,690
I have this technology.

2423
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:53,090
Would you guys sponsor me to clean crime?

2424
01:45:54,670 --> 01:46:00,490
Guys, I need some sponsors so I can buy some new... so I can buy some new cleaning materials.

2425
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:05,250
Guys, guys, if I don't, like, Big James is gonna fucking kill me.

2426
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:08,570
I just don't want that.

2427
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:12,030
Oh, this is for hard to reach places too.

2428
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:16,270
Narcy, thank you for the super chat.

2429
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:18,130
Thank you for... welcome to the tomato farm.

2430
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:18,870
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2431
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:20,410
Okay.

2432
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:22,770
Alright, we're gonna learn.

2433
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:27,150
We're gonna learn today regarding the power washer.

2434
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:29,670
That is pretty handy.

2435
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,450
Yeah, I actually like it.

2436
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:36,110
Now that I, like, figured out how to use the power washer, I think I like it.

2437
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:38,130
Okay.

2438
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:40,130
There we go.

2439
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,720
Did you guys know they're making a regular show sequel?

2440
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:49,700
And an Adventure Time sequel?

2441
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:53,160
And then somebody was talking about how, like...

2442
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,200
I think it's, like, sort of true.

2443
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:57,580
But, like... like, it's cool.

2444
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,240
But then, like, the thing is...

2445
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,780
The thing is that, like...

2446
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:05,160
We're all just getting, like...

2447
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:05,560
Re...

2448
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,040
Recyc...

2449
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:07,700
Like...

2450
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:08,340
Like...

2451
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,720
Like, it's just nostalgia bait.

2452
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:16,220
And also, like, the new generation isn't getting new TV shows.

2453
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,960
They're just getting our, like, hand-me-downs now.

2454
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,820
Because nobody is, like...

2455
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:22,820
No com...

2456
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:23,980
No cartoon net...

2457
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:28,980
Like, cartoon station is willing to, like, make new shows.

2458
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,320
They're just, like...

2459
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:30,460
Yeah.

2460
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,900
They're, like, reheating the series and everything.

2461
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:33,320
And I...

2462
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,000
I sort of...

2463
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:34,660
I, like...

2464
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:34,980
I...

2465
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,380
I think so, too.

2466
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:37,280
Because I was, like...

2467
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,440
Do we really...

2468
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:38,760
Okay.

2469
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,780
I feel like...

2470
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:44,740
I feel like it just makes the show worse when you take...

2471
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,700
When you re...

2472
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:46,900
Reboot...

2473
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,320
Like, reboot a series.

2474
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:53,600
Or not just reboot, but add more episodes to a show that's already ended perfectly.

2475
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,720
Because it's, like...

2476
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:58,480
The voice actors are also getting older.

2477
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,300
And they just don't sound the same.

2478
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:05,700
I think the worst part is that, like, the voice actress for Marge Simpson...

2479
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,500
She sounds like a dying cat now.

2480
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:12,480
Because she's 80 years old.

2481
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,380
The voice actress for Marge Simpson is 80 years old!

2482
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,880
And she's...

2483
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,160
Oh, my God.

2484
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,220
She does not sound okay.

2485
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:22,980
Like...

2486
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:24,660
Because, like...

2487
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,400
Oh, my God.

2488
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:28,080
And...

2489
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,960
No, no.

2490
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,600
If you compare her voice now for Marge...

2491
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,740
Versus her voice, like, before...

2492
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:39,080
Like, her classic Marge Simpson voice...

2493
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,000
It's actually, like...

2494
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,600
Oh, my...

2495
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,600
Let her retire, please!

2496
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:47,160
Oh, my God.

2497
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:48,180
It's just...

2498
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:48,800
It's...

2499
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:50,060
No!

2500
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:51,120
Tenjin!

2501
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:52,420
This is your fault!

2502
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,060
This is your fault, Tenjin!

2503
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:58,040
Okay.

2504
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:59,560
Let me use this.

2505
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:02,320
Why can't I...

2506
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,180
Why can't I fucking...

2507
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:04,840
Okay.

2508
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:05,940
I'll clean that later.

2509
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:11,020
Yeah.

2510
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:11,860
And then, like...

2511
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:14,740
And then, apparently, like, writers don't even know how to...

2512
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:15,840
Why can't I use this?

2513
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:16,740
No.

2514
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:17,000
Okay.

2515
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:19,520
Writers don't even know how to write endings anymore.

2516
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,480
Because...

2517
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:22,000
Because, like...

2518
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,300
Wait.

2519
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:22,940
Did I not refill?

2520
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:23,540
No, I did.

2521
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,780
Writers don't know how to write endings anymore.

2522
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:28,020
Because every show gets canceled.

2523
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,560
Every show gets canceled before it ends.

2524
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:32,340
That's right.

2525
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,780
The music knows I'm speaking my truth now.

2526
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:35,560
Like...

2527
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:39,920
Even the music knows I'm speaking my truth.

2528
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,520
Yeah, they all, like...

2529
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,340
I'm still...

2530
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:44,840
Guys, no.

2531
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:47,380
I'm still fucking upset that Inside Out got canceled.

2532
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:48,920
That was such a good show.

2533
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:53,840
Like, I was looking forward to more episodes of Inside Out, and then Netflix canceled it.

2534
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:56,120
But Netflix is always canceling shows.

2535
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:57,900
Which fucking sucks.

2536
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,020
It was so good.

2537
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:02,060
It was such a well-written show.

2538
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:03,800
Inside Job.

2539
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:04,240
Yeah, sorry.

2540
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:04,840
Inside Job.

2541
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:05,240
Sorry.

2542
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:06,580
There's two...

2543
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:07,060
Sorry.

2544
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:07,920
Inside Job.

2545
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:09,600
The conspiracy theorist show.

2546
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,420
It was such...

2547
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:11,000
It was so good.

2548
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,500
And then they canceled it after...

2549
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:21,460
They canceled it after, like, two seasons.

2550
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,100
Which fucking sucks.

2551
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:26,300
Because it was actually really well-written, too.

2552
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,880
And then I was really looking forward to more episodes of Inside Out.

2553
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,420
But they were like, nope.

2554
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,160
Nope.

2555
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,180
We're canceling it.

2556
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:32,660
All right.

2557
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:33,780
Now we're listening to Ghibli.

2558
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:38,740
Yay!

2559
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,340
Okay.

2560
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,800
Let's refill this.

2561
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:47,340
Ba-bum.

2562
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:48,560
Bum-bum.

2563
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:49,820
Ba-da-dum.

2564
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,820
Oh, it was even once...

2565
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:54,780
Yeah, it was one season split into two.

2566
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:55,320
You're right.

2567
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:56,260
Yeah, that's worse.

2568
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,260
Honestly.

2569
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:57,880
I don't know.

2570
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:00,420
I think that's even worse because it's not even, like, a full season.

2571
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:03,520
It was just one season split into two.

2572
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:04,980
Okay.

2573
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,500
Let's get this out of the way.

2574
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,940
We need to upgrade our...

2575
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,840
We gotta upgrade a power washer.

2576
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:12,420
Doesn't matter.

2577
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:13,440
Honestly.

2578
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:15,140
Like, who's gonna miss the...

2579
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:16,640
Who's gonna miss the...

2580
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:17,740
The wine?

2581
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:20,360
All right.

2582
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,020
Gotta clean this beautiful artwork.

2583
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,000
We gotta make sure...

2584
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,880
We gotta make sure this artwork is still there.

2585
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,680
You're too far from the pressure washer.

2586
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,060
Oh, whoops.

2587
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,140
Squid Game is taking too much budget.

2588
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:33,820
I just...

2589
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,500
I don't understand why Squid Game needs a second season.

2590
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:37,140
It was...

2591
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:37,780
It...

2592
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:39,640
Like, Squid Game, Squid Harder?

2593
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:40,260
Like...

2594
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:41,480
Like...

2595
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:42,520
I don't know.

2596
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:43,660
I feel like...

2597
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:44,880
I feel like...

2598
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,460
Like, what do you do?

2599
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,740
We all know the premise of Squid Game.

2600
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:49,280
They just...

2601
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,960
They're just gonna redo the whole thing with new...

2602
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:57,560
I guess it's sort of like Saw, where, like, we sort of know what the situation is like.

2603
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:57,660
I don't know.

2604
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,460
And, like, I don't know.

2605
01:51:59,540 --> 01:51:59,920
Saw...

2606
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,920
Saw had a lot.

2607
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:09,460
I also feel like it ended well enough that it did not need, like, a second season.

2608
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:10,500
What is it?

2609
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:11,840
Do you guys remember Handmaiden's Tale?

2610
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:18,660
Like, the first two seasons, everybody was, like, super, super excited.

2611
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:20,700
Like, people were talking about Handmaiden's Tale.

2612
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,560
But then, like, they got out of, like...

2613
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,700
And then I was like, what happened to Handmaiden's Tale?

2614
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,140
You know?

2615
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,860
Because, like, it's still ongoing.

2616
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:28,280
Oh.

2617
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:29,660
No, it's fine.

2618
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:31,420
Like, who's gonna miss that anyway?

2619
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:32,960
Like, it's...

2620
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:36,660
It's fine.

2621
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,460
Does it affect...

2622
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:39,200
Do I lose money for breaking that vase?

2623
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:41,360
Am I supposed to...

2624
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,440
Oh, I might lose money.

2625
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:42,880
Okay.

2626
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:43,980
Whoops.

2627
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:44,500
Okay.

2628
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:45,020
That's...

2629
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,440
That's a little...

2630
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:49,240
It can't be a legit China vase, right?

2631
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:52,240
It cannot be from the Ming Dynasty, right?

2632
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,080
I mean...

2633
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:53,300
No.

2634
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,580
This gotta be fake.

2635
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:56,600
Why would you put that in the spa?

2636
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:58,500
I lost 2K?

2637
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:01,520
Is this coming out of my paycheck?

2638
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:02,080
No!

2639
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:05,140
My daughter is sick!

2640
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:07,740
They won't...

2641
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:10,980
Who would put a fucking expensive vase in the spa?

2642
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,780
Like, that's just...

2643
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:16,920
That just tells people to break it.

2644
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:17,580
No!

2645
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:17,920
No!

2646
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,240
No!

2647
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:18,500
No!

2648
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:18,820
No!

2649
01:53:18,820 --> 01:53:19,140
No!

2650
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:19,340
No!

2651
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:19,460
No!

2652
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:19,640
No!

2653
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:19,800
No!

2654
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,000
No!

2655
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:20,180
No!

2656
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:20,420
No!

2657
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:20,720
No!

2658
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:21,040
No!

2659
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:21,260
No!

2660
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:22,500
No!

2661
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:22,620
No!

2662
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:22,800
No!

2663
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:23,160
No!

2664
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:23,440
No!

2665
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:23,580
No!

2666
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:23,640
No!

2667
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:23,680
No!

2668
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:24,660
Put this here for now.

2669
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:26,080
Okay.

2670
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,300
Put this here.

2671
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:28,240
Alright.

2672
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:31,320
It was broken already when I got here!

2673
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:33,300
It was already broken!

2674
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,320
You can't blame that on me!

2675
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,480
Oh, there's another!

2676
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,660
There's the women's bathroom.

2677
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:40,140
Okay, this is actually closer.

2678
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:41,860
Uuuuh.

2679
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,680
I can't believe it!

2680
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,380
Okay, let's put this in the women's...

2681
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:52,200
Like, how would he know that that was already...

2682
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,380
That wasn't broken already.

2683
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:55,140
What was I talking about?

2684
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:59,680
Before I was thinking about cleaning...

2685
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,160
about the broken vase.

2686
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,280
Okay, let's...

2687
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:05,460
I guess we'll be delicate here.

2688
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:08,800
Is there anything?

2689
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:09,600
Oh, here it is.

2690
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:09,880
Okay.

2691
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,660
I mean, we can power wash with that.

2692
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:13,400
Oh yeah, Squid Game.

2693
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,440
It's like... okay, Handmaiden's Tale.

2694
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:17,540
Yeah, I was saying about Handmaiden's Tale.

2695
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,240
The thing about...

2696
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,560
And then I was like...

2697
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,240
Oh, what happened to that show?

2698
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:25,060
Are they still being trapped in the tale?

2699
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:30,840
Are the ladies still trapped?

2700
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:32,880
And then they're apparently...

2701
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,360
in Canada now.

2702
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:35,640
I was like, what?

2703
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:39,560
They're in Canada and trying...

2704
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,240
to do a revolt.

2705
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,060
So they're not...

2706
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:44,560
trapped anymore.

2707
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,380
And then apparently the show got worse...

2708
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,920
because of the fact that...

2709
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:51,440
the fact that...

2710
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,500
it got less interesting.

2711
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,160
Not because they're in Canada.

2712
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:56,120
Like...

2713
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,860
It's not because...

2714
01:54:58,860 --> 01:54:59,880
It's because they escaped.

2715
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:02,540
So they're like, what do we do with the story now?

2716
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:05,160
So now the story is that they're trying to...

2717
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:07,180
overthrow the government and stuff.

2718
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,720
But then it got...

2719
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,340
boring.

2720
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,080
Apparently it got really boring.

2721
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,660
I think the funniest thing about the show...

2722
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:16,700
is the fact that one of the actresses...

2723
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:17,740
is a Scientologist.

2724
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:18,680
So...

2725
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,440
I don't know.

2726
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:22,600
I think...

2727
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:23,600
I don't know.

2728
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:24,560
It's pretty ironic.

2729
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,940
Like one of the lead actresses...

2730
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:28,300
is a fucking Scientologist.

2731
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,720
So I thought that was like...

2732
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:33,000
super ironic that they're in The Handmaid's Tale.

2733
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:33,920
Like...

2734
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:37,660
Yeah!

2735
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,680
I don't remember what her name was.

2736
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,680
But she was one of the main actresses.

2737
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:44,620
Oh shit.

2738
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,080
That's okay.

2739
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:45,840
I'll clean that later.

2740
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:47,920
I'll clean that later.

2741
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:51,420
Oh no!

2742
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,520
My power washer!

2743
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:53,100
It's okay.

2744
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:56,740
Let's see.

2745
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:58,700
Okay, we're just gonna clean this.

2746
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,580
Oh, so that's how they...

2747
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:02,080
they did the killing.

2748
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,100
They got an ice pick.

2749
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:05,460
God, why can't...

2750
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,260
As a janitor, I should just have like...

2751
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,400
a pet pig around me.

2752
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,740
You know pigs eat blood?

2753
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,460
Or like drink blood?

2754
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:15,080
And like, it's okay.

2755
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:17,260
There's no like health concerns for it too.

2756
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:18,380
There's no like health concerns for it too.

2757
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:19,840
In anything.

2758
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:23,020
If I'm gonna be a crime scene...

2759
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:24,180
Yeah, they eat anything.

2760
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,000
They eat bone.

2761
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:25,960
They eat blood.

2762
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:27,580
They can drink blood.

2763
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,940
Basically, the reason why I was like...

2764
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:34,080
If I'm gonna be a crime scene killer...

2765
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,040
I should have a pet pig.

2766
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:37,780
Is that you can literally get a pig...

2767
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:39,700
and just clean up the entire thing.

2768
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:40,860
Because that's food!

2769
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:42,160
And you don't need to feed the pig!

2770
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:44,700
Yeah, they eat each other.

2771
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:45,460
So like...

2772
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:46,740
So like...

2773
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:48,420
If a pig gets injured...

2774
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:51,420
They separate the pig from the other...

2775
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,060
The injured pig from the other pigs.

2776
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:55,100
Because if a pig has a scratch...

2777
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:56,240
and starts bleeding...

2778
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:58,400
The other pigs will fucking eat that pig.

2779
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,080
Because they see it as food.

2780
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:03,280
Which is pretty fucked up, but welcome to nature I guess.

2781
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:04,180
Like...

2782
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:09,440
Like...

2783
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,260
It's fucked up, but the circle of life, baby.

2784
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,200
And then someone was saying...

2785
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:16,200
It's a silly bone.

2786
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:18,720
Yeah, but bone is easier to dispose of.

2787
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,980
Like I don't have to clean the blood anymore.

2788
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,220
I can literally just like...

2789
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:25,460
Pick up the bone and like...

2790
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,080
I can just pick up the bone.

2791
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,300
And just...

2792
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:30,320
Put it in a trash can.

2793
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:33,480
Like I'm already disposing the bodies.

2794
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:34,980
But now it's like less work.

2795
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:36,600
Because then I can just...

2796
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:39,000
Get like 10 pigs here.

2797
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:40,520
Get 10 pigs.

2798
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:42,600
And then like go wild.

2799
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:44,200
Oh, they eat the bones too.

2800
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,400
Get 10 pigs in here.

2801
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,460
Go fucking wild.

2802
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,920
Eat the bones.

2803
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,500
Don't have to worry about biological waste.

2804
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:55,320
And then like...

2805
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,720
Just gotta take care of 10 pigs.

2806
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:59,100
And then you know...

2807
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,300
After the 10 pigs...

2808
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:03,020
You know, and if the 10 pigs...

2809
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:05,000
Get old, eat the pigs.

2810
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:05,940
Free food.

2811
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:10,360
That's free food right there.

2812
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:15,480
Alright, we got the ice pick evidence.

2813
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:17,880
Okay, we don't have to worry about that.

2814
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:18,260
Wait, what?

2815
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,020
How do I...

2816
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:20,380
How do I get...

2817
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:21,020
Oh, is it this?

2818
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:25,180
Uh...

2819
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,300
What?

2820
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,060
Oh!

2821
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:32,160
Oh, I see.

2822
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:32,520
Okay.

2823
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:34,340
This is easy.

2824
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:36,780
Okay, I can just...

2825
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:38,500
Oh, it gets rid of my health for that.

2826
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:39,440
Okay, this is easy.

2827
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,060
Professor Jason!

2828
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:42,200
Oh, hey.

2829
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,860
Everything I say is hypothetical.

2830
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,980
Welcome to the tomato farm.

2831
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,080
Mr. Lawyer.

2832
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:54,120
Everything I say is all hypothetical.

2833
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:56,920
It's a game.

2834
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:57,720
It's a game.

2835
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:58,780
We're all just...

2836
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,100
It's all hypothetical, sir.

2837
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:04,040
Oh, money.

2838
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:06,760
My hypothetical money, by the way.

2839
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:07,620
My hypothetical money, by the way.

2840
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:08,380
In -game money.

2841
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:10,440
I forgot about things.

2842
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:14,420
Water up, water down?

2843
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:15,980
The fuck does that mean?

2844
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,560
Oh, I cleaned the water!

2845
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:21,420
Wait, that's that easy?

2846
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,620
And now the water's clean!

2847
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:25,380
And now the water's clean!

2848
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:26,320
Okay.

2849
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,000
Okay, let's...

2850
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:31,680
Wait, how do I...

2851
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:31,980
Okay.

2852
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:34,020
Okay, I gotta get rid of this.

2853
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:34,880
I gotta get rid of the water here.

2854
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:36,880
Alright.

2855
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:38,100
Let's see.

2856
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,280
Okay, so...

2857
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,040
Now that...

2858
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,720
Okay, I need to get my pressure thing here.

2859
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:46,980
I'll refill it first before I clean the inside of the pool.

2860
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:49,600
Alright.

2861
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:53,560
You still got blood?

2862
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:56,300
Yeah, but it's just a little blood.

2863
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:57,380
Okay.

2864
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:00,140
Um, we'll keep the bodies in here.

2865
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:01,780
This is like my body room.

2866
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,940
My body hole.

2867
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,920
So we'll put that here, and then we'll pressure... Oh shit!

2868
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:07,360
It's fine.

2869
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,580
You won't miss that.

2870
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:10,540
It's fine.

2871
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:15,500
That was already... Like, when they were committing the murders, I'll just say, like, the bodies...

2872
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:18,080
The bodies were fully dead when you stabbed him.

2873
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:19,860
And then they moved around a little bit.

2874
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,240
And then after they moved around, they broke those glasses.

2875
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:23,260
Like...

2876
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:25,100
Like, how would he know?

2877
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,740
How would he know?

2878
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:27,420
It's like...

2879
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:30,580
It's glasses you can get at a fucking dollar store.

2880
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:31,580
It's literally one dollar.

2881
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:32,960
It's not that important, guys.

2882
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,020
It's one dollar glasses.

2883
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:35,200
It's...

2884
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:38,760
Like...

2885
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:41,820
It's one dollar glass... I bet it's not even glass.

2886
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:43,120
I bet it's a plastic cup.

2887
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:47,720
I bet it's a plastic cup I can get for 50 cents.

2888
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:52,840
What are they recording?

2889
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:53,800
There's no way.

2890
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,120
There's no way they're recording this.

2891
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:57,320
There's no sound in...

2892
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:59,940
Like, there's no sound in, like...

2893
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:01,700
In, like, recording cameras.

2894
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:03,760
Alright.

2895
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:05,200
Wipe all the blood.

2896
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:05,900
Okay.

2897
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:06,320
Whoops.

2898
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,960
That's another plastic...

2899
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:11,140
Guys, you can tell that cup is plastic with the way...

2900
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:13,240
Look, as long as I don't break the...

2901
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:17,980
I don't break the expensive whiskey, then it's fine.

2902
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:19,500
Then it's five dollars.

2903
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:19,820
See?

2904
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,360
I didn't break the whiskey.

2905
02:01:24,140 --> 02:01:24,860
It's fine.

2906
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:32,320
Yeah, from the... I can literally go to Daiso and grab the same cup.

2907
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:34,740
Can I break this?

2908
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,280
Oh, so that's fucking strong.

2909
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:38,640
Oh shit, that's a gun.

2910
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,520
That's...

2911
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:42,140
Okay.

2912
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:44,040
This is pretty relaxing.

2913
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:48,360
It helps that I'm listening to Ghibli while doing this.

2914
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:52,000
Okay,

2915
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:55,520
nice.

2916
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:56,760
More plastic cups.

2917
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:57,360
Whoops.

2918
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:58,620
It's fine.

2919
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:01,720
Alright.

2920
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:06,500
It's not the whiskey, right?

2921
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:08,180
Guys, that's fine.

2922
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:08,880
That's fine.

2923
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:13,680
We'll just say that in their dying breath, they knocked some things away.

2924
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:17,760
That's okay.

2925
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:20,020
We still have this bottle of whiskey, guys.

2926
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:21,420
We're fine.

2927
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,380
We still...

2928
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,680
We still have this bottle of whiskey.

2929
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,260
We're fine.

2930
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,000
I keep making a better mess.

2931
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:30,360
But at least it's clean.

2932
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,480
At least it's clean.

2933
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,000
That's all that matters.

2934
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:36,280
It's at least clean.

2935
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:37,760
Oh shit!

2936
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:38,760
Okay, we're fine.

2937
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:40,840
We're fine.

2938
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:45,040
Oh, we need a pool gun.

2939
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:47,080
It's like a little water gun.

2940
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:51,320
I'm gonna clean this area first before...

2941
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,620
Alright, I'm gonna make sure this area is fine too.

2942
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:57,080
Alright...

2943
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:57,440
...

2944
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,180
Okay, we're gonna grab this.

2945
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:03,260
Another one.

2946
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:06,860
And then, what else is there?

2947
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,480
Okay, it's just a body so I can just clean the pool.

2948
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:12,700
You're right.

2949
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,040
I'll charge the build attention.

2950
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:17,360
That's how we're gonna get away with it.

2951
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:20,940
It's like almost good as new, chat.

2952
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,540
We just need to make sure there's no body here and it's almost good as new.

2953
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,220
Alright, refill time.

2954
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:32,720
Refill time.

2955
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:34,540
Oh, our playlist is almost over.

2956
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:38,000
Alright, any suggestions for music to listen to?

2957
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:42,220
Best calming music to listen to?

2958
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:45,880
Guys, it has to be good cleaning music, guys.

2959
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,060
It has to...

2960
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:54,120
It has to be good cleaning music, guys.

2961
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:57,480
We already listened to a Minecraft...

2962
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:58,840
Oh!

2963
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:00,440
I know.

2964
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:03,140
Pokemon Jazz.

2965
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:05,360
Or Lo-Fi.

2966
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:07,520
Maybe Jazz or Lo-Fi.

2967
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:10,000
An orchestra mix?

2968
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:10,920
Oh, that's good.

2969
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:12,940
Here we go.

2970
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:22,320
Thanks, we have an orchestra mix too.

2971
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,140
Yay!

2972
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:37,760
I don't recognize this song.

2973
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:43,880
Where the fuck is that from?

2974
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:45,000
Is this from the newer games?

2975
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,740
That can't be Pokemon!

2976
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,640
That's not the Pokemon I know!

2977
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:56,600
That's not the Pokemon I know!

2978
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,440
What the fuck is that?

2979
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:00,660
Is that...

2980
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,820
Is that the newest one?

2981
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:03,540
It could be.

2982
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:05,560
I was like, what song is that?

2983
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,920
I don't even recognize it.

2984
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:09,360
But it's good.

2985
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:14,380
Yeah, but I can't relate because I don't recognize it.

2986
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:21,220
How am I supposed to relate to it if I don't recognize it, chat?

2987
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,920
Oh, there's smooth jazz.

2988
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:24,740
Oh, wait.

2989
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:30,120
Oh, I recognize this.

2990
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:32,540
Bum, bum, bum.

2991
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,620
Oh, I know this.

2992
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:37,260
Ooh.

2993
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:40,160
You like jazz?

2994
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:45,180
Okay, I didn't break anything.

2995
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:48,460
Alright, we're gonna get rid of the blood here.

2996
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:54,150
Yes, we're black and white!

2997
02:05:54,250 --> 02:05:55,230
I recognize this one.

2998
02:05:58,550 --> 02:06:01,750
Okay, there's a little blood here, so I gotta clean this part too.

2999
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:03,610
It's so relaxing.

3000
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:08,110
It's crazy how music can just change the vibe of the game.

3001
02:06:14,710 --> 02:06:15,990
Okay, we gotta clean this.

3002
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:22,330
There's a spot in a...

3003
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:23,670
Okay, let me grab my lamp.

3004
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:25,890
I think it's easier if I have my lamp.

3005
02:06:29,450 --> 02:06:29,890
Okay.

3006
02:06:34,370 --> 02:06:35,410
Where is it?

3007
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:36,090
Oh, no!

3008
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:39,390
There's no spot here.

3009
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:41,050
Everything is clean.

3010
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:42,530
Okay, there's like one up here.

3011
02:06:44,150 --> 02:06:45,890
Uh, and there's some here.

3012
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:46,310
Okay.

3013
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:47,810
Alright, nice.

3014
02:06:48,490 --> 02:06:50,010
I guess I can...

3015
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:51,990
Okay, let's clean the chair first.

3016
02:06:52,450 --> 02:06:53,450
No, my lamp!

3017
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:55,530
Fuck.

3018
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:56,610
Uh, it's fine.

3019
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:58,250
I can see all the mess anyway.

3020
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:00,410
It's fine.

3021
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:01,930
I see where the mess is.

3022
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:04,710
And then now I can use my mop, I think.

3023
02:07:06,190 --> 02:07:07,430
Just to get the...

3024
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:08,950
the hard to get spots.

3025
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:13,170
Okay, I think that's good.

3026
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:15,790
Anything else?

3027
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:20,430
Okay, we'll grab this here.

3028
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:23,750
I wonder where the secrets are.

3029
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:27,010
Is that everything?

3030
02:07:27,530 --> 02:07:28,990
Oh, there's my feet.

3031
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:32,470
How did I cause such a big mess here?

3032
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:35,150
How did I do that?

3033
02:07:35,490 --> 02:07:35,610
How did I do that?

3034
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:36,270
Okay.

3035
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,710
Oh no.

3036
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:38,210
Oh wait, no.

3037
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:38,710
It still works.

3038
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:39,750
Oh, it doesn't work anymore.

3039
02:07:40,490 --> 02:07:41,390
Push my hands.

3040
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:48,210
Okay, now it should be clean.

3041
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:50,690
Okay, I gotta make sure I clean the...

3042
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:52,410
where I spilled my...

3043
02:07:53,150 --> 02:07:54,210
where I spilled it.

3044
02:07:56,770 --> 02:07:58,650
I don't even know where the secrets are.

3045
02:07:58,910 --> 02:08:00,030
Is it in the women's bathroom?

3046
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:02,810
Oh, this one's locked.

3047
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:04,470
Oh, this one's locked.

3048
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:06,150
Oh, there's money.

3049
02:08:06,830 --> 02:08:08,330
Would these be the secrets?

3050
02:08:09,150 --> 02:08:11,110
Oh my god, Rome is very popular.

3051
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:14,330
Where are the...

3052
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:15,950
Where are the...

3053
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:17,750
dead ladies?

3054
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:19,270
Why is there only dead men?

3055
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:22,870
I need to open it from the other side.

3056
02:08:22,870 --> 02:08:24,250
Oh, I need to open it from this side.

3057
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:24,610
Okay.

3058
02:08:25,050 --> 02:08:25,490
Okay.

3059
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:27,650
Science tip.

3060
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:30,170
Hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid dissolves...

3061
02:08:30,170 --> 02:08:31,430
Oh, I learned that from Breaking Bad!

3062
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:34,710
But it takes like a really long time to do it.

3063
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:36,130
So you might as well just get a pig.

3064
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:38,010
That's what I'm saying.

3065
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:40,370
Why go through all that trouble?

3066
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:46,850
Why go through all that trouble dissolving a body if you just get a pig?

3067
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:50,610
It's just that much more convenient.

3068
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:51,690
IMO.

3069
02:08:53,870 --> 02:08:54,870
Okay, let's grab...

3070
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:55,710
Let's destroy...

3071
02:08:55,710 --> 02:08:58,770
Let's get rid of all the garbage here that was already...

3072
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:01,990
By the way, that was here already, by the way, guys.

3073
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,230
The trash was always here.

3074
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:05,390
Remember that.

3075
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:12,110
It was here when I...

3076
02:09:12,110 --> 02:09:13,270
when I got here.

3077
02:09:14,030 --> 02:09:15,850
Like, I can't believe it.

3078
02:09:16,070 --> 02:09:20,070
When you're committing murder, at least clean up the murder.

3079
02:09:22,050 --> 02:09:24,070
Just clean up a little bit.

3080
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,390
Support your janitors.

3081
02:09:26,570 --> 02:09:30,370
Putting so much work onto me to clean this up for them.

3082
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:35,390
Toki operates on pig physics.

3083
02:09:36,050 --> 02:09:37,910
It's just more convenient.

3084
02:09:38,790 --> 02:09:42,370
The only issue is that you gotta take care of the pigs.

3085
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:46,850
But like, if the pigs are too hard to take care of, just rent some pigs.

3086
02:09:47,710 --> 02:09:51,870
Rent some pigs and like take it back to the farm after you're done.

3087
02:09:52,010 --> 02:09:56,110
And then the farmers don't have to spend money on pig food.

3088
02:09:56,610 --> 02:09:59,810
I'll just be like, can I rent a pig for a day and I'll pay for the...

3089
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:01,330
I'll pay for its meals.

3090
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,980
What about the people who like...

3091
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:11,420
Well, the pigs have to poop.

3092
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,580
Yeah, but there's not...

3093
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:14,260
People won't know they're dead bodies.

3094
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:15,980
They won't know.

3095
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:16,620
What's it gonna do?

3096
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:17,200
Poop blood?

3097
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,240
No, it won't.

3098
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:20,400
It's just regular...

3099
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:21,100
What are they gonna do?

3100
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:22,360
Examine the poop?

3101
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:23,800
Who has the time to do that?

3102
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:25,760
I would not get caught.

3103
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,580
Like, I'm safe.

3104
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:30,760
I can't get... I will not get caught.

3105
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:32,720
I'm still fucking making content right now.

3106
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,640
Sir...

3107
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:38,620
Okay, we gotta get rid of this.

3108
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:40,120
Okay, we gotta get rid of this evidence.

3109
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,660
So this is the true form of the...

3110
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:46,500
True form of the tomato fire.

3111
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,340
Thank you for the super chat.

3112
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:49,820
Thank you.

3113
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:50,660
Thank you.

3114
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:51,180
All true.

3115
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,120
Oh my god, did they use a pizza cutter to...

3116
02:10:58,120 --> 02:10:59,320
to kill that guy?

3117
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:00,220
Oh!

3118
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:05,080
They used a pizza cutter for fucking slicing the throat?

3119
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:07,820
Holy shit, that guy had some fun.

3120
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,840
That guy had a lot of fun.

3121
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,880
Is that all the trash?

3122
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:16,980
Is there any more?

3123
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:19,140
I don't think so.

3124
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,000
I think I got all the trash.

3125
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,280
Alright, let's see.

3126
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:24,520
Okay, well...

3127
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:28,040
Okay, I got all the trash, so...

3128
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,680
Let's do some basketball.

3129
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:30,420
Watch this.

3130
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:33,440
Okay, wait.

3131
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:34,420
I didn't know the range.

3132
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,080
There we go.

3133
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:37,700
Look at that.

3134
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:39,540
Fucking...

3135
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:41,940
Kobe!

3136
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:43,720
Oh, shit.

3137
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:44,540
Oh, wait!

3138
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:46,460
Nice.

3139
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:47,300
Game logic.

3140
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:48,660
Kobe!

3141
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:49,700
Oh.

3142
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,440
Wait, why is it going down?

3143
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:54,280
I'm throwing up!

3144
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:56,680
There we go.

3145
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:58,420
Easy.

3146
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:00,260
It just works.

3147
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:01,880
Oh, I see.

3148
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:05,040
Oh, if I hold it.

3149
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:06,820
If I hold it, it goes further.

3150
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:07,940
See?

3151
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:09,980
Look at that.

3152
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:15,300
Why does that pizza cutter have a crosscard?

3153
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,480
Thank you for the super chat.

3154
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:17,100
Thank you, thank you.

3155
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:20,200
Speaking of pizzas, I was so mad.

3156
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:21,600
Okay, not mad.

3157
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:23,360
I was so annoyed.

3158
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:25,920
Because, like, um...

3159
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,900
Yesterday, I had a huge craving for pizza.

3160
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:31,000
So, I was like, oh, what kind...

3161
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,060
I was turning up at four in the morning because I went...

3162
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:33,740
I took a nap.

3163
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:39,060
Um, I took a nap and, like, I ended up waking up at two in the morning.

3164
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,660
So I didn't have dinner or anything.

3165
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:42,600
So, I was like, oh, I want pizza.

3166
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:48,220
So, the only places that were open at that time was, like, pizza and burgers and stuff.

3167
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:49,100
So, I was like, you know what?

3168
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:49,820
I'm going to get some pizza.

3169
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:55,120
And then they were doing, like, this promotion where it was like, buy one, get one...

3170
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:55,780
Uh...

3171
02:13:04,490 --> 02:13:06,790
It was broken when I got here, guys.

3172
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:09,010
It was broken when I got here.

3173
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:14,390
I don't know what you're talking about.

3174
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:17,110
It was broken when I got here.

3175
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:23,530
Anyway, as I was saying...

3176
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:27,930
Oh wait, it wouldn't matter if I use the mob.

3177
02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:29,630
There's no fragile stuff here.

3178
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:37,070
Anyway, it said it was selected pizzas.

3179
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:41,810
But the pizzas I wanted was not in the selected pizzas.

3180
02:13:41,930 --> 02:13:43,090
So I got really confused.

3181
02:13:43,250 --> 02:13:46,470
I was like, okay, I really want to order these two pizzas.

3182
02:13:46,610 --> 02:13:48,930
But it's not part of the promotion.

3183
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:54,150
So I was like, okay, I'm going to order two pizzas.

3184
02:13:55,570 --> 02:13:58,230
Because I really wanted those two specific pizzas.

3185
02:13:58,790 --> 02:13:59,610
Okay, it'll be fine.

3186
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:00,590
If I spill it, right?

3187
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:02,210
Oh, it refills it.

3188
02:14:02,350 --> 02:14:08,050
And then I got a pepperoni pizza and a spicy pizza.

3189
02:14:08,290 --> 02:14:09,750
Because I wanted some spice, too.

3190
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:12,170
They didn't have the...

3191
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:19,470
Okay, there's this specific pizza that I really like these days.

3192
02:14:19,730 --> 02:14:21,010
It's very specific.

3193
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:23,590
It's like pepperoni with hot honey.

3194
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:25,530
I don't know if you guys ever had it.

3195
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:29,230
But it's basically pepperoni pizza.

3196
02:14:29,230 --> 02:14:30,690
But with a kick in it.

3197
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:31,550
With the hot honey.

3198
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:33,890
And it's so good.

3199
02:14:34,610 --> 02:14:37,550
It's like really, really, really good.

3200
02:14:38,230 --> 02:14:39,590
So it's just like...

3201
02:14:39,590 --> 02:14:42,170
It adds like a sweet and spice to it.

3202
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:44,550
I highly suggest trying it out.

3203
02:14:44,590 --> 02:14:46,310
It's actually really, really fucking good.

3204
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:50,510
And then like...

3205
02:14:50,510 --> 02:14:53,810
But the thing is, the pizza place I wanted to order didn't have hot honey.

3206
02:14:54,010 --> 02:14:55,210
So I was like, all right.

3207
02:14:55,370 --> 02:14:55,730
Then...

3208
02:14:56,450 --> 02:14:57,710
And so I was like, all right.

3209
02:14:57,790 --> 02:14:58,390
So I'm going to get...

3210
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:59,130
I'll just separate...

3211
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:01,570
Or there's some spicy pizza and hot honey.

3212
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:02,870
And pepperoni.

3213
02:15:02,870 --> 02:15:05,410
And then like, you know, try the slices out.

3214
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:07,930
And so I was like...

3215
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:09,750
So I ordered two pizzas.

3216
02:15:09,990 --> 02:15:13,030
And then the guy brought me four fucking boxes of pizza.

3217
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:17,430
And I was like, what?

3218
02:15:17,570 --> 02:15:19,010
He's like, so...

3219
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:21,130
Yeah, so I went to collect it.

3220
02:15:21,250 --> 02:15:22,690
And then he's like, yeah, there's a lot.

3221
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:24,030
There's four boxes.

3222
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:25,770
And I was like, excuse me?

3223
02:15:26,010 --> 02:15:26,310
Like...

3224
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:35,090
So like, apparently the pizza store has a special promotion for all the pizzas.

3225
02:15:35,950 --> 02:15:37,250
I didn't know.

3226
02:15:37,610 --> 02:15:41,630
It literally said, these are the pizzas that are buy one get one free.

3227
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:43,770
So I was like, well, I don't really want those pizzas.

3228
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:45,630
I want this specific one.

3229
02:15:45,850 --> 02:15:47,690
And then so I got four fucking...

3230
02:15:47,690 --> 02:15:49,090
I got four boxes of pizzas.

3231
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:50,870
I don't know what to...

3232
02:15:50,870 --> 02:15:52,450
I don't know what to do.

3233
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:56,290
I don't know what to do.

3234
02:15:57,330 --> 02:15:57,890
I...

3235
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:03,830
Oh, that's...

3236
02:16:03,830 --> 02:16:05,310
Oh, I forgot about this lady.

3237
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:07,330
I forgot she existed.

3238
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:09,330
Oh, whoops.

3239
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:09,590
Okay.

3240
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:10,210
Whoops.

3241
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:11,070
We gotta...

3242
02:16:13,190 --> 02:16:14,270
Yeah, I don't...

3243
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:18,570
Now I have four boxes of pizzas that I have to finish in like, I don't know, three to four days.

3244
02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:21,530
Oh, shit.

3245
02:16:21,570 --> 02:16:22,490
That's a lot of blood.

3246
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:23,930
Okay.

3247
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:26,270
Oh, shit.

3248
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:27,850
Oh, that's really hard to clean.

3249
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:29,450
I'm gonna get the pressure washer in here.

3250
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:30,910
Okay.

3251
02:16:30,990 --> 02:16:33,210
So that's where the 86% was.

3252
02:16:34,190 --> 02:16:34,670
Okay.

3253
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:35,690
Oh, my God.

3254
02:16:35,850 --> 02:16:38,770
Like, why is your blood so difficult to clean?

3255
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:40,970
I don't understand.

3256
02:16:41,310 --> 02:16:42,430
Your blood should...

3257
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:43,930
Oh, is it because it's got microwave?

3258
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:46,130
Is it because of microwave?

3259
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:47,870
It's microwave blood.

3260
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:49,230
So it's a harder stain.

3261
02:16:49,430 --> 02:16:50,410
That must be it.

3262
02:16:53,090 --> 02:16:54,590
Is it obvious what to do?

3263
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:55,070
You feel...

3264
02:16:55,070 --> 02:16:57,370
Yeah, he feeds the pigs.

3265
02:16:57,570 --> 02:16:59,990
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

3266
02:17:00,090 --> 02:17:00,450
Thank you.

3267
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:01,110
Thank you.

3268
02:17:01,230 --> 02:17:03,710
Yeah, this lady died by tanning.

3269
02:17:03,790 --> 02:17:05,830
I was like thinking, like, how do you...

3270
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:10,270
How's your blood stains if you like, if you just got like heated to death?

3271
02:17:10,530 --> 02:17:13,070
Like, it's not like you got squashed or anything.

3272
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:15,130
Like, I don't understand.

3273
02:17:16,530 --> 02:17:24,170
Any like, any like criminologist in chat can tell me like the science behind dying by a tanner.

3274
02:17:24,170 --> 02:17:25,310
Cause like...

3275
02:17:25,310 --> 02:17:26,430
Oh, she popped.

3276
02:17:26,990 --> 02:17:29,710
Oh, because of like the heat pressure.

3277
02:17:29,930 --> 02:17:31,910
So she popped like a popcorn.

3278
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:33,990
I get it.

3279
02:17:34,270 --> 02:17:40,990
Oh, so like the heat pressure expanded her and she popped like a popcorn.

3280
02:17:43,470 --> 02:17:44,590
I see.

3281
02:17:44,810 --> 02:17:47,650
I was just thinking if you get microwaved, how is their blood?

3282
02:17:48,030 --> 02:17:50,290
Why is it so difficult to clean?

3283
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:51,430
God.

3284
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:52,750
If you're gonna...

3285
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:53,890
Like, just shoot her.

3286
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:58,090
I feel like just shooting her would have been like so much easier.

3287
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:01,510
And less messier.

3288
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:04,170
I guess like they wanted to be fancy with their kill.

3289
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:07,770
If you kill for a living, you get bored eventually.

3290
02:18:07,950 --> 02:18:11,890
So you start being fancy with it just to have like some spice in that life.

3291
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:14,550
Cause like, you know, you gotta be...

3292
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:19,190
It must be like really monotonous if you're like...

3293
02:18:19,790 --> 02:18:21,910
Monotonous if you're like just killing.

3294
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:23,310
For a job.

3295
02:18:24,110 --> 02:18:25,070
And like...

3296
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:27,610
And then like, you know, you get bored eventually.

3297
02:18:28,470 --> 02:18:30,930
If you just, you know, if you just pop, pop.

3298
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:33,030
Or just one singular pop.

3299
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:34,790
And you just want to feel something.

3300
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:37,470
You're like, you know, let's get a little creative with it.

3301
02:18:38,770 --> 02:18:39,830
Do I change it?

3302
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:41,890
Yeah, gotta change it up every now and then.

3303
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:43,370
You know?

3304
02:18:44,650 --> 02:18:46,790
How do I free her from the tanner?

3305
02:18:47,910 --> 02:18:48,930
Oh, there she is.

3306
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:51,290
Alright, don't worry.

3307
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,270
Oh my god.

3308
02:18:53,370 --> 02:18:55,310
She fucking popped her hair too?

3309
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:57,790
Get in there.

3310
02:18:58,770 --> 02:19:00,190
What happened to her hair?

3311
02:19:01,070 --> 02:19:02,930
You can't just microwave hair away.

3312
02:19:03,370 --> 02:19:04,110
Can you?

3313
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:08,950
Oh shit, wait, that's the lockers.

3314
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:13,030
Wait.

3315
02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:15,310
Oh, there it is.

3316
02:19:15,530 --> 02:19:16,070
Okay.

3317
02:19:17,010 --> 02:19:18,590
Okay, so these are all...

3318
02:19:18,590 --> 02:19:19,670
Yoink, yoink.

3319
02:19:19,730 --> 02:19:20,150
They're dead.

3320
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:20,710
It's not...

3321
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:22,750
It's not evil if they're dead already.

3322
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:25,370
It burned off?

3323
02:19:25,550 --> 02:19:26,310
That can happen?

3324
02:19:26,430 --> 02:19:27,990
Wait, how do you guys know that?

3325
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:29,070
Like...

3326
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:31,050
Wait a minute.

3327
02:19:31,690 --> 02:19:32,330
How...

3328
02:19:33,150 --> 02:19:35,130
How do you guys know that?

3329
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:35,670
Huh?

3330
02:19:37,990 --> 02:19:38,630
Sigh.

3331
02:19:40,810 --> 02:19:41,450
Oh!

3332
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:43,550
There's a VIP.

3333
02:19:44,930 --> 02:19:45,790
Hey, there's basketball.

3334
02:19:48,010 --> 02:19:49,350
Okay, we gotta grab...

3335
02:19:49,350 --> 02:19:49,930
Yoink, yoink.

3336
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:53,270
Let's put the basketball back.

3337
02:19:55,050 --> 02:19:57,090
Oh shit, did I kill a basketball player?

3338
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:07,070
Did you guys hear about Logan Paul and KSI sending, like, fucking 10...

3339
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:11,810
Like, was it a shitload of Prime to, like, the people from the...

3340
02:20:11,810 --> 02:20:13,310
From people who...

3341
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:15,770
Who needed the Prime?

3342
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:16,290
Who needed, like, water?

3343
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:21,870
I thought that was funny because they could literally have sent water, but then they sent Prime.

3344
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:22,910
I...

3345
02:20:23,550 --> 02:20:23,850
I...

3346
02:20:23,850 --> 02:20:25,210
I don't understand.

3347
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:29,770
Like, I feel like if they sent water, it'll be better publicity.

3348
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:31,450
Like, why...

3349
02:20:35,630 --> 02:20:36,230
I...

3350
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:36,990
I...

3351
02:20:36,990 --> 02:20:37,210
I...

3352
02:20:37,210 --> 02:20:37,290
I...

3353
02:20:37,290 --> 02:20:37,590
I...

3354
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:38,310
I...

3355
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:38,370
I...

3356
02:20:38,370 --> 02:20:38,810
I...

3357
02:20:38,810 --> 02:20:38,870
I...

3358
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:38,910
I...

3359
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:39,050
I...

3360
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:39,150
I...

3361
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:39,630
I don't understand.

3362
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:40,070
Like, this is so funny.

3363
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:40,970
I was like...

3364
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:42,310
Like, it's like...

3365
02:20:42,310 --> 02:20:42,610
I...

3366
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:43,190
I get it.

3367
02:20:43,230 --> 02:20:49,970
Like, well, that's, like, a really nice thing to do, but, like, why did they fucking send Prime?

3368
02:20:50,210 --> 02:20:50,730
Like...

3369
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:58,170
Like, would it have helped their publicity so much if they literally just sent...

3370
02:20:58,170 --> 02:20:59,430
It'd be cheaper!

3371
02:21:00,390 --> 02:21:00,910
Like...

3372
02:21:00,910 --> 02:21:07,610
I guess they're like, oh, if we send them Prime instead of water because they're, like, apparently, like, it's, like, a really hard...

3373
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:08,730
They haven't been in...

3374
02:21:09,570 --> 02:21:17,410
I can sort of understand it because they're like, oh, what if we get these people hooked onto Prime because there's no water in the city.

3375
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:19,610
There's literally, like, no water in the city.

3376
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:20,870
So, like...

3377
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:30,150
And apparently, it's, like, a really hard to reach place so that, like, other natural, like, necessity supplies can't get there.

3378
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:36,470
So, they are forced to drink Prime for, like, for, like, water, you know, to not die from dehydration.

3379
02:21:36,930 --> 02:21:38,010
But then, like...

3380
02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:38,710
So, then they're, like...

3381
02:21:38,730 --> 02:21:45,350
I guess, like, their thinking is that, oh, we can get them addicted to Prime, you know, during a hurricane, by the way.

3382
02:21:45,690 --> 02:21:46,210
During...

3383
02:21:46,210 --> 02:21:46,710
Like...

3384
02:21:47,310 --> 02:21:47,830
Like...

3385
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:48,670
I just...

3386
02:21:48,670 --> 02:21:50,190
It's just a little...

3387
02:21:50,190 --> 02:21:51,510
It's a little fucked.

3388
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:52,090
Like...

3389
02:21:53,770 --> 02:21:54,290
Like...

3390
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:55,150
The thinking...

3391
02:21:55,150 --> 02:21:55,410
Well...

3392
02:21:55,410 --> 02:22:06,010
Like, after the hurricane is over and they're back in their life, like, back to, like, normal society, they're like, oh, I'm gonna drink Prime because I'm addicted to Prime now.

3393
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:06,630
Or, like...

3394
02:22:06,630 --> 02:22:06,730
Like, whoa.

3395
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:08,530
Like...

3396
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:09,610
Yeah, it's...

3397
02:22:09,610 --> 02:22:09,830
It's...

3398
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:10,290
It's...

3399
02:22:10,290 --> 02:22:11,090
I don't know.

3400
02:22:11,330 --> 02:22:16,290
Like, their motto is that, like, any publicity is good publicity.

3401
02:22:16,670 --> 02:22:18,930
Which is crazy to think about.

3402
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:19,510
Like...

3403
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:24,990
Like, so many things has happened to KSI and Logan Paul.

3404
02:22:25,310 --> 02:22:26,550
And, like...

3405
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:28,790
And they get away with...

3406
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,950
I...

3407
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:29,590
I don't...

3408
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:32,470
I don't understand.

3409
02:22:33,550 --> 02:22:34,430
They're, like...

3410
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:34,730
They...

3411
02:22:36,290 --> 02:22:38,170
They're so many things.

3412
02:22:39,710 --> 02:22:40,890
Yeah, they are!

3413
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:41,850
There's...

3414
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:43,310
They still have an audience.

3415
02:22:43,730 --> 02:22:44,510
Oh, my God.

3416
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:48,610
Guys, if KSI and Logan Paul fans are gonna come into my...

3417
02:22:48,610 --> 02:22:50,570
Guys, I don't know if I should start...

3418
02:22:50,570 --> 02:22:55,190
Like, they're gonna be like, who's this fucking P and G trying to start a fight with me?

3419
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:56,050
You're not even real.

3420
02:22:56,490 --> 02:22:56,970
Like...

3421
02:22:59,770 --> 02:23:04,630
Guys, it would be so funny, though, if, like, KSI...

3422
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:04,710
Like, KSI would be like, oh, I'm gonna...

3423
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:07,190
Oh, my God, Logan Paul acknowledged me for trying to fight them.

3424
02:23:07,330 --> 02:23:07,870
Like...

3425
02:23:07,870 --> 02:23:10,270
It wasn't real to us.

3426
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:11,930
Like...

3427
02:23:16,930 --> 02:23:19,010
I just can't believe.

3428
02:23:19,310 --> 02:23:21,890
I thought that shit was so crazy.

3429
02:23:22,930 --> 02:23:25,030
That shit was so crazy.

3430
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:28,050
Like, literally, they're like, we're gonna send Prime.

3431
02:23:28,590 --> 02:23:31,590
Like, a fucking truckload of Prime.

3432
02:23:33,470 --> 02:23:34,670
To the people.

3433
02:23:34,670 --> 02:23:34,690
Like...

3434
02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:35,750
To the people that need water.

3435
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:37,270
And I'm like, just send water.

3436
02:23:38,290 --> 02:23:38,730
Just...

3437
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:40,150
Just send water.

3438
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:44,150
Fado, thank you for the super chat.

3439
02:23:44,210 --> 02:23:44,570
Thank you.

3440
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:45,250
Thank you.

3441
02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:46,490
Hello, Doki.

3442
02:23:46,610 --> 02:23:48,370
I've been watching you since your glorious return.

3443
02:23:48,650 --> 02:23:49,570
And you're always the highlight.

3444
02:23:49,690 --> 02:23:50,170
Also, it's my birthday.

3445
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:51,790
Can I humbly ask for a happy birthday?

3446
02:23:51,870 --> 02:23:52,230
Of course.

3447
02:23:52,630 --> 02:23:54,090
Happy birthday to you.

3448
02:23:54,350 --> 02:23:55,870
Happy birthday to you.

3449
02:23:56,050 --> 02:23:57,730
Happy birthday, dear Fado.

3450
02:23:57,890 --> 02:23:59,370
Happy birthday to you.

3451
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:01,710
Where's the last blood?

3452
02:24:01,850 --> 02:24:03,910
I have, like, a 98% left.

3453
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:04,670
Oh, my God.

3454
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:06,630
I have a great birthday.

3455
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:10,350
That it?

3456
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:11,690
No, I'm still at 98.

3457
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:16,290
What else do I have?

3458
02:24:17,510 --> 02:24:18,110
Oh, okay.

3459
02:24:18,190 --> 02:24:19,330
It's, like, right here.

3460
02:24:19,470 --> 02:24:21,150
It's, like, a hard to reach spot.

3461
02:24:23,830 --> 02:24:24,290
98?

3462
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:25,750
What else?

3463
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:27,750
Where is the last drop?

3464
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:30,350
Oh, shit.

3465
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:31,150
That's not what I want.

3466
02:24:33,010 --> 02:24:33,470
Okay.

3467
02:24:33,570 --> 02:24:33,930
Okay.

3468
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:34,650
Okay.

3469
02:24:34,670 --> 02:24:35,870
Let's, like, turn on.

3470
02:24:36,050 --> 02:24:36,410
Okay.

3471
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:37,890
We're gonna bring this.

3472
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:39,130
Get this over here.

3473
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:40,030
Get this over here.

3474
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:40,990
How do I?

3475
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:43,970
Okay.

3476
02:24:44,910 --> 02:24:45,890
Do I need blood?

3477
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:47,810
Do I need doko?

3478
02:24:48,530 --> 02:24:49,390
Blood doko?

3479
02:24:51,530 --> 02:24:53,630
Johnny Lacone, thank you for the super chat.

3480
02:24:53,810 --> 02:24:54,130
Thank you.

3481
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:54,890
Thank you.

3482
02:24:54,990 --> 02:24:55,170
Wait.

3483
02:24:55,230 --> 02:24:56,090
Is there blood in here?

3484
02:24:56,950 --> 02:24:57,390
No.

3485
02:24:57,450 --> 02:24:58,470
This should be the office.

3486
02:25:00,230 --> 02:25:04,590
Didn't Logan Paul get sued by a manufacturer of Prime because they backed order too much Prime?

3487
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:07,410
They just sticked to a product and refused to pay due to not being able to sell?

3488
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:07,870
Wait.

3489
02:25:07,910 --> 02:25:08,490
Is that true?

3490
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:10,950
I didn't know that.

3491
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:12,030
Oh, there's so many.

3492
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:12,990
Oh, maybe it's this.

3493
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:18,510
There's so many things that happen with, like, Logan Paul and KSI.

3494
02:25:18,530 --> 02:25:20,470
I can't keep track of it anymore.

3495
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:21,450
Like...

3496
02:25:21,950 --> 02:25:22,430
Like...

3497
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:26,010
There's so many stuff.

3498
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:29,550
Like, it's so hard to keep track of it.

3499
02:25:30,890 --> 02:25:34,610
Because they get away with so much that, like, I don't even know anymore.

3500
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:34,630
Okay.

3501
02:25:38,910 --> 02:25:40,110
Everything seems clean.

3502
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:45,790
Oh, like each room is different.

3503
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:46,810
I see.

3504
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:49,530
I mean it's like 98%.

3505
02:25:49,530 --> 02:25:51,250
It's like almost perfect.

3506
02:25:51,730 --> 02:25:52,650
Oh, it's here.

3507
02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:54,010
The back side of the chair.

3508
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:56,090
Okay, now it's 99.

3509
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:58,830
Maybe it's like the back side of this chair?

3510
02:25:59,090 --> 02:25:59,810
Oh, there it is.

3511
02:26:00,610 --> 02:26:01,110
Okay.

3512
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:04,410
Wait, really?

3513
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:05,530
Oh, yeah!

3514
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:06,270
I did it!

3515
02:26:06,670 --> 02:26:07,170
Nice!

3516
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:10,050
Alright, let's see.

3517
02:26:10,410 --> 02:26:10,910
Whoops.

3518
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:13,630
Now I just got to dispose of this.

3519
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:15,210
Now it's time to play basketball.

3520
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:16,870
I get over here.

3521
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:18,730
Alright.

3522
02:26:19,370 --> 02:26:19,870
Nice!

3523
02:26:19,970 --> 02:26:21,090
Alright, this is the trash.

3524
02:26:22,430 --> 02:26:24,010
Y'all is in the trash!

3525
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:26,950
Nice.

3526
02:26:28,150 --> 02:26:28,650
Alright.

3527
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:31,310
Whoops.

3528
02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:31,810
Whoops.

3529
02:26:33,150 --> 02:26:33,630
Boom.

3530
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:34,590
He's dead already.

3531
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:35,050
It's fine.

3532
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:37,090
Alright.

3533
02:26:38,170 --> 02:26:40,110
Time to eat this corpse out too.

3534
02:26:42,810 --> 02:26:43,630
In you go!

3535
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:44,610
No!

3536
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:45,690
It was so close!

3537
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:46,630
Can I punch it over?

3538
02:26:47,190 --> 02:26:47,670
Nice.

3539
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:47,890
Okay.

3540
02:26:48,170 --> 02:26:48,650
Nice.

3541
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:49,490
Alright, that's convenient.

3542
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:51,990
That's convenient.

3543
02:26:52,850 --> 02:26:53,590
Oops, sorry.

3544
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:55,050
That was intentional.

3545
02:26:57,470 --> 02:26:57,950
Alright.

3546
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:00,110
In you go!

3547
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:02,670
Boop!

3548
02:27:03,770 --> 02:27:05,030
Oh, come on!

3549
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:07,550
Here we go.

3550
02:27:11,030 --> 02:27:12,990
I'm not actually sorry.

3551
02:27:13,230 --> 02:27:13,950
Oops, sorry!

3552
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:17,770
Alright.

3553
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:22,330
In you go!

3554
02:27:22,550 --> 02:27:23,490
God damn it!

3555
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:27,190
Guys, I know like...

3556
02:27:27,190 --> 02:27:28,670
This is not intentional.

3557
02:27:28,670 --> 02:27:30,230
I'm just too lazy.

3558
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:31,630
There we go.

3559
02:27:32,850 --> 02:27:35,110
I'm too lazy to pick him up again.

3560
02:27:35,310 --> 02:27:38,550
It's just more convenient to just chuck...

3561
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:39,490
punch him forward.

3562
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:44,130
It's literally just more convenient, guys.

3563
02:27:46,690 --> 02:27:47,330
Nice.

3564
02:27:47,990 --> 02:27:49,270
Alright, so...

3565
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:51,610
I have 95%?

3566
02:27:54,470 --> 02:27:55,270
Where's the blood?

3567
02:27:58,670 --> 02:28:01,770
It says 95% but like, where's the blood?

3568
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,370
Where is it?

3569
02:28:09,250 --> 02:28:10,910
There's literally nothing here.

3570
02:28:11,970 --> 02:28:13,110
I don't understand.

3571
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:17,290
No, it's like in here.

3572
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:20,170
Oh, it's in here!

3573
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:20,990
Oh!

3574
02:28:21,270 --> 02:28:23,310
Then it has to be...

3575
02:28:24,390 --> 02:28:25,910
Where could it be then?

3576
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:31,460
Where could the last remaining be?

3577
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:32,800
Where could the last remaining be?

3578
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:35,140
Oh, there...

3579
02:28:35,140 --> 02:28:36,020
No, that's not it.

3580
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:37,360
Wait, where's my UV light?

3581
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:40,060
Oh, no?

3582
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:41,460
Where did I put my UV light?

3583
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,040
Is it the sink?

3584
02:28:44,380 --> 02:28:44,660
Is it the sink?

3585
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:46,280
No?

3586
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:48,900
Where did I put my light?

3587
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:55,660
Where the fuck is it?

3588
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:58,740
Guys, I can't find my UV light.

3589
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:00,660
I don't know where I put it.

3590
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:03,200
Okay, we'll have this.

3591
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:07,940
No, that's just a regular light.

3592
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:11,080
Guys, thank you for the super chat!

3593
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:13,200
Oh, you got into medical school!

3594
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:13,940
Congratulations!

3595
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:17,900
Look at that chat!

3596
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,360
I told you we had smart dragoons!

3597
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:23,000
I fucking told you guys!

3598
02:29:23,220 --> 02:29:24,160
I knew it.

3599
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:26,400
I always knew we had smart dragoons here.

3600
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,420
But they say chat reflects the streamer.

3601
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,860
Where could the blood be?

3602
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:37,880
Is it the mirror?

3603
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:40,400
I think that's just regular fluids.

3604
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:43,660
Yeah.

3605
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:46,680
It's literally just regular fluids.

3606
02:29:47,580 --> 02:29:48,140
See?

3607
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:49,340
He can read!

3608
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:51,600
I fucking knew it.

3609
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:52,960
If I can read, he can read.

3610
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:59,680
95% Like, this is fully clean.

3611
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:03,240
No, it's...

3612
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:03,840
Oh, shit.

3613
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:08,740
95% is actually a very high percentage for blood.

3614
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:12,460
No one will know.

3615
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:13,820
It's fine.

3616
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:15,760
I'm too lazy.

3617
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:22,900
Guys, all I'm saying is that if they wanted a five star clean, they would have hired two people.

3618
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,940
Not just one.

3619
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,800
There's literally nothing in here.

3620
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:37,320
Like, if they want a better job of cleaning, it would have been two people.

3621
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:42,080
Like, they hired one so they cheapened out.

3622
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:45,060
Floor near door?

3623
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:45,900
Okay.

3624
02:30:50,230 --> 02:30:51,310
That's all I'm saying.

3625
02:30:51,430 --> 02:30:52,370
They cheapened out.

3626
02:30:56,170 --> 02:30:59,050
Check the flower pot in the building.

3627
02:30:59,290 --> 02:31:00,050
That was bloody.

3628
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:02,550
No, the flower pot is okay.

3629
02:31:05,050 --> 02:31:06,810
In the changing room closet?

3630
02:31:07,090 --> 02:31:07,770
There's a closet?

3631
02:31:10,590 --> 02:31:11,570
Oh, shit.

3632
02:31:12,270 --> 02:31:12,790
Oh, shit.

3633
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:17,770
I would there to be like, okay, if there's blood in here, it's not because of fucking...

3634
02:31:17,770 --> 02:31:19,410
It's not because of murder.

3635
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:22,250
It's literally that it could be somebody's time of the month.

3636
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:24,370
Like, does it really matter?

3637
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:28,990
If it's in the bathroom, it's not because of murder.

3638
02:31:30,410 --> 02:31:32,770
Holy shit, the Anubis actually scared me.

3639
02:31:33,230 --> 02:31:36,370
I thought it was like...

3640
02:31:36,370 --> 02:31:37,010
Oh, my God.

3641
02:31:37,050 --> 02:31:39,130
I legitimately thought that was like...

3642
02:31:39,130 --> 02:31:41,310
I thought that was like a person.

3643
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:47,570
Yep, I'm cleaning murder stains.

3644
02:31:49,090 --> 02:31:51,470
I'm cleaning fucking murder stains.

3645
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:53,390
Not because I'm like...

3646
02:31:53,390 --> 02:31:54,970
I'm not a real janitor.

3647
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:56,210
I'm here to clean blood.

3648
02:31:58,630 --> 02:31:59,190
Okay.

3649
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:04,070
Alright, this is 99%.

3650
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:05,410
The fuck is...

3651
02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:06,870
Okay, I'm not here.

3652
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:09,750
It doesn't have to be perfect at that point.

3653
02:32:09,810 --> 02:32:11,990
If it's 99%, then fuck that shit.

3654
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:15,610
Okay, that's it.

3655
02:32:15,710 --> 02:32:16,070
It's alright.

3656
02:32:17,270 --> 02:32:20,330
Yeah, but then it won't be suspicious blood?

3657
02:32:23,330 --> 02:32:25,750
It won't be suspicious blood.

3658
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:27,430
It's just regular blood.

3659
02:32:30,590 --> 02:32:32,710
Where does the VIP access go to?

3660
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:37,880
Wait.

3661
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:39,540
Yeah, exactly.

3662
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:41,980
I killed 99%... Oh, there it is.

3663
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:44,060
99% blood.

3664
02:32:44,180 --> 02:32:44,580
Oh, hey.

3665
02:32:46,900 --> 02:32:47,680
Oh, hey.

3666
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:48,860
What happens in here?

3667
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:51,880
Oh, calligraphy?

3668
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:57,580
I mean, like...

3669
02:32:58,450 --> 02:32:58,760
Okay.

3670
02:32:58,960 --> 02:32:59,700
Oh, no!

3671
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:01,540
Not just calligraphy.

3672
02:33:01,820 --> 02:33:03,560
Intense calligraphy.

3673
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:08,460
It's hardcore calligraphy.

3674
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:15,200
Imagine doing powder and then fucking doing calligraphy after.

3675
02:33:15,880 --> 02:33:16,600
Like...

3676
02:33:18,260 --> 02:33:19,560
Alright, nice.

3677
02:33:19,580 --> 02:33:20,620
We got the...

3678
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:23,180
Oh, nice.

3679
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:24,440
All this extra cash.

3680
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:26,420
Calligraphy.

3681
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,460
Advanced calligraphy.

3682
02:33:31,140 --> 02:33:33,480
Things get pretty intense.

3683
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:35,640
You don't understand with the powder.

3684
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:36,420
Things get...

3685
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:40,280
Things get pretty fucking intense with calligraphy after that.

3686
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:47,640
The powder helps it lock in.

3687
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:51,000
It's so fucking locked in after that.

3688
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:53,180
Okay.

3689
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:54,480
Oh my god.

3690
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:55,980
He mixed alcohol in it too.

3691
02:33:56,040 --> 02:33:56,880
That shit's intense.

3692
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:00,120
Interior design is my passion.

3693
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:02,340
That is intense calligraphy.

3694
02:34:03,580 --> 02:34:04,240
Okay.

3695
02:34:06,340 --> 02:34:06,740
Um...

3696
02:34:06,740 --> 02:34:08,100
Where would the flower pot be?

3697
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:08,900
I guess like... Oh!

3698
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:11,820
Wait, can I steal the rubber ducky?

3699
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:14,700
I want my daughter to get some rubber duckies.

3700
02:34:15,800 --> 02:34:17,680
Alright, we're gonna collect this rubber ducky.

3701
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:20,800
Okay.

3702
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:22,380
Where does this go?

3703
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:25,680
Oh.

3704
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:27,200
No, that's not where it goes.

3705
02:34:27,300 --> 02:34:28,080
Wait, where does this go?

3706
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:31,580
Okay.

3707
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:32,720
That goes here.

3708
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:37,740
It's nice that I've got some screwdrivers with me too.

3709
02:34:38,980 --> 02:34:40,220
Where's the other thing?

3710
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:42,620
Oh, there it is.

3711
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:43,120
I was gonna say.

3712
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:44,540
I swear I have another table.

3713
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:47,140
Okay, where's the other chair?

3714
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,220
Oh, there it is.

3715
02:34:51,380 --> 02:34:51,800
No.

3716
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:53,060
That's not it.

3717
02:34:55,020 --> 02:35:01,920
Okay, if we put this vase over here, it's almost like there's nothing missing.

3718
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:02,460
See?

3719
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:03,120
Look at that.

3720
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:07,420
Okay, we gotta...

3721
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:10,620
Okay, we gotta...

3722
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:11,400
Okay, this vase...

3723
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:13,400
If we put this vase here...

3724
02:35:14,820 --> 02:35:15,860
And then...

3725
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:18,240
This vase over here...

3726
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:22,320
Guys, I know it's different sizes, but like, I don't think people would notice.

3727
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:23,420
I don't...

3728
02:35:24,820 --> 02:35:26,760
Guys, they won't notice.

3729
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:27,800
How would they know?

3730
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,120
How would they know?

3731
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:33,380
Okay, this goes here.

3732
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,660
And then this goes here.

3733
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,080
Is that it?

3734
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:41,140
Where's my other chair?

3735
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:44,520
This chair?

3736
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:47,620
Where the fuck did the other chair go?

3737
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:49,240
Oh, wait.

3738
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:50,260
Nice.

3739
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:52,800
Why is there a suitcase here?

3740
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:00,740
Oh, nice.

3741
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:03,340
Okay, I'm gonna take the suitcase.

3742
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:04,720
This might be an important suitcase.

3743
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:05,440
You don't know that.

3744
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:07,500
There we go.

3745
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:11,340
Oh, it's this chair!

3746
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:12,660
I thought it fit the environment.

3747
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:13,760
It looked so...

3748
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:16,000
It literally fits so well.

3749
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:19,380
What am I missing?

3750
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:23,520
Oh, wait.

3751
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:25,760
Oh, nice.

3752
02:36:26,820 --> 02:36:32,160
Everything I touch turns to gold, turns to coal, turns then to rust, then to dust.

3753
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:33,440
Nice memes.

3754
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:34,780
Nice memes.

3755
02:36:36,300 --> 02:36:36,840
Okay.

3756
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:38,080
What else?

3757
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:39,660
I'm missing some more?

3758
02:36:40,700 --> 02:36:42,460
I'm missing two furnitures.

3759
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,380
Where?

3760
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:47,460
Is it the flat?

3761
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:48,440
Is it the rubber duck?

3762
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:50,680
Oh, it's the rubber duckies!

3763
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:51,860
Oh!

3764
02:36:57,220 --> 02:36:57,760
Okay.

3765
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,780
That has to be it, right?

3766
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:02,680
Is it the rubber duckies?

3767
02:37:02,940 --> 02:37:07,720
Is it the rubber duckies?

3768
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:07,820
Oh.

3769
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:08,420
Whoops.

3770
02:37:09,260 --> 02:37:09,780
Whoops.

3771
02:37:10,220 --> 02:37:12,080
Guys, it was not the rubber duckies, guys.

3772
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:13,620
Where does this flower go?

3773
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:18,620
Where does this flower go?

3774
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:23,340
Where does this flower go?

3775
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:27,220
Where does this flower go?

3776
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:27,540
Where does this flower go?

3777
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:31,660
Where...

3778
02:37:31,660 --> 02:37:33,720
Why is my ego vision working?

3779
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:36,400
On top of the meadow...

3780
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:37,060
Oh, is it here?

3781
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:40,340
No, it doesn't.

3782
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:44,020
Oh, my God.

3783
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:44,500
This wall...

3784
02:37:44,500 --> 02:37:45,900
This weird wall of shit is gonna...

3785
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:46,800
I'm gonna go crazy.

3786
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:47,420
Oh, wait!

3787
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:48,480
No!

3788
02:37:55,560 --> 02:37:57,080
I can't grab it!

3789
02:37:59,180 --> 02:37:59,740
No!

3790
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:03,420
No!

3791
02:38:09,250 --> 02:38:09,750
No!

3792
02:38:09,970 --> 02:38:10,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

3793
02:38:11,410 --> 02:38:12,790
It must be a way.

3794
02:38:13,290 --> 02:38:14,110
Oh, no!

3795
02:38:14,250 --> 02:38:14,770
Oh, no!

3796
02:38:14,890 --> 02:38:15,570
I can't!

3797
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:16,630
Oh, I got it!

3798
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:17,750
Oh, I got it!

3799
02:38:17,790 --> 02:38:20,370
I fucking got it!

3800
02:38:20,430 --> 02:38:22,090
I actually got it!

3801
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:23,350
Oh, thank God.

3802
02:38:23,390 --> 02:38:24,170
Okay, we're fine.

3803
02:38:24,730 --> 02:38:25,230
Okay.

3804
02:38:25,490 --> 02:38:27,510
I thought I burnt it forever.

3805
02:38:28,130 --> 02:38:29,150
Oh, thank God.

3806
02:38:29,190 --> 02:38:29,450
Okay.

3807
02:38:29,530 --> 02:38:29,970
It's fine.

3808
02:38:30,130 --> 02:38:31,010
Okay, we got it.

3809
02:38:31,030 --> 02:38:31,650
We fixed everything.

3810
02:38:32,210 --> 02:38:33,550
Okay, we did it.

3811
02:38:33,650 --> 02:38:34,010
Yay!

3812
02:38:35,130 --> 02:38:36,050
The trash?

3813
02:38:36,550 --> 02:38:38,710
There's 1% of trash?

3814
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:40,290
Is it this?

3815
02:38:40,570 --> 02:38:40,850
No.

3816
02:38:42,710 --> 02:38:44,050
Why is there so trash?

3817
02:38:45,850 --> 02:38:47,830
Where the fuck is the last trash?

3818
02:38:52,330 --> 02:38:53,410
Oh, my God.

3819
02:38:53,470 --> 02:38:55,410
Where the fuck is the last trash?

3820
02:38:57,950 --> 02:38:59,090
Are you serious?

3821
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:03,190
How...

3822
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:04,310
What do you mean?

3823
02:39:06,310 --> 02:39:09,180
Where the fuck...

3824
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:09,700
It's like 1.

3825
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:11,240
It's like...

3826
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:12,680
It's literally 1 trash.

3827
02:39:15,980 --> 02:39:16,780
Okay, it's...

3828
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:18,160
Get rid of the trash.

3829
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:20,680
It's literally 99%.

3830
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:23,900
Oh, my God.

3831
02:39:23,980 --> 02:39:24,160
What?

3832
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:25,560
Is that it?

3833
02:39:25,980 --> 02:39:26,740
Is that trash?

3834
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:29,060
Oh, it's just... Oh, wait.

3835
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:29,460
It's money.

3836
02:39:29,780 --> 02:39:30,960
Wait, that's better than trash.

3837
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:32,900
This is better...

3838
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:35,120
Oh, my God.

3839
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:36,020
This is better than trash.

3840
02:39:36,480 --> 02:39:36,880
Nice.

3841
02:39:40,180 --> 02:39:42,080
Where the fuck is that 1%?

3842
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:43,160
Where the fuck is that 1%?

3843
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:46,210
Where the fuck is that 1%?

3844
02:39:46,410 --> 02:39:47,510
Oh, my God.

3845
02:39:47,610 --> 02:39:48,470
I swear to God.

3846
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:50,490
I'm gonna go fucking crazy, like...

3847
02:39:50,970 --> 02:39:52,750
I still have evidence, too?

3848
02:39:53,210 --> 02:39:53,250
I still have evidence, too?

3849
02:39:55,830 --> 02:39:56,830
Oh, it's this.

3850
02:39:57,310 --> 02:39:57,450
Oh, it's this.

3851
02:39:59,170 --> 02:40:00,150
Okay, nice.

3852
02:40:07,450 --> 02:40:08,390
Rockefeller Records?

3853
02:40:08,690 --> 02:40:08,710
Rockefeller Records?

3854
02:40:09,150 --> 02:40:11,290
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

3855
02:40:12,470 --> 02:40:13,590
Bum, bum, bum.

3856
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:17,470
Bum, bum, bum.

3857
02:40:18,390 --> 02:40:18,490
Bum, bum, bum.

3858
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:19,870
Bum, bum, bum.

3859
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:21,590
Bum, bum, bum.

3860
02:40:22,090 --> 02:40:23,090
Oh, my God.

3861
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:24,750
No wonder he fucking died.

3862
02:40:26,410 --> 02:40:26,890
Oh,

3863
02:40:31,490 --> 02:40:31,890
my God.

3864
02:40:31,910 --> 02:40:32,430
My mom.

3865
02:40:33,890 --> 02:40:34,730
What the fuck?

3866
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:34,830
Yeah.

3867
02:40:37,050 --> 02:40:38,970
Oh, no wonder he fucking died.

3868
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:41,570
Bro, say his crap.

3869
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:44,610
I'm making it out of the hood.

3870
02:40:44,610 --> 02:40:45,730
Oh, damn.

3871
02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:47,210
That's fucked.

3872
02:40:47,690 --> 02:40:48,550
But true.

3873
02:40:50,230 --> 02:40:51,170
So true.

3874
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:54,950
I don't know where the last trash is, guys.

3875
02:40:54,990 --> 02:40:55,890
I'm gonna go fucking crazy.

3876
02:40:56,790 --> 02:40:58,650
The one last trash.

3877
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:00,650
Is that it?

3878
02:41:01,130 --> 02:41:02,330
Is that it over there?

3879
02:41:02,770 --> 02:41:04,230
It's like... Oh, my God.

3880
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:05,490
It's literally in the pool.

3881
02:41:09,250 --> 02:41:10,730
Oh, my God.

3882
02:41:10,850 --> 02:41:12,010
It's right here.

3883
02:41:13,890 --> 02:41:15,870
I can't even... Okay, there we go.

3884
02:41:15,950 --> 02:41:16,430
We did it.

3885
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:17,690
We cleaned it up.

3886
02:41:18,410 --> 02:41:19,190
All right.

3887
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:20,130
Thank God.

3888
02:41:21,970 --> 02:41:22,750
All right.

3889
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:23,150
Nice.

3890
02:41:23,530 --> 02:41:24,290
Oh, shit.

3891
02:41:24,410 --> 02:41:25,010
Oh, it's fine.

3892
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:26,490
It says task completed.

3893
02:41:26,810 --> 02:41:27,510
All right.

3894
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:28,090
We did it.

3895
02:41:29,710 --> 02:41:30,810
We did it.

3896
02:41:32,390 --> 02:41:33,510
I'll finish it.

3897
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:35,690
And I'll be able to...

3898
02:41:35,690 --> 02:41:37,670
Guys, 5% is fine.

3899
02:41:38,170 --> 02:41:39,270
They won't notice.

3900
02:41:42,540 --> 02:41:46,800
If they won a better job, they would have hired two people.

3901
02:41:46,900 --> 02:41:47,040
Look.

3902
02:41:47,480 --> 02:41:48,040
100%.

3903
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:48,920
Look at that.

3904
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:50,020
100%.

3905
02:41:50,020 --> 02:41:51,220
Perfect score.

3906
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:54,780
The mob does not really care about...

3907
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:57,760
The mob doesn't care about the details, guys.

3908
02:41:58,020 --> 02:42:00,320
If they cared about the details...

3909
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:01,200
What's his name?

3910
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:02,180
Was it Al Capone?

3911
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:06,660
Al Capone wouldn't have got busted for tax reasons if they cared about the details.

3912
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:13,040
Oh, nice.

3913
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:16,860
Oh, nice.

3914
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:17,080
Perfect.

3915
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:17,620
Yay.

3916
02:42:20,260 --> 02:42:20,740
Yay.

3917
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:22,360
Can't deny that.

3918
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:24,900
Yay.

3919
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:29,620
That's why they should care.

3920
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:29,860
Look.

3921
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:30,560
That's not my fault.

3922
02:42:30,780 --> 02:42:31,820
I'm not the mob.

3923
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:33,120
I'm just a contractor.

3924
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:39,660
Al Capone was fishing his own swimming pool at the end.

3925
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:40,360
Al Capone?

3926
02:42:40,740 --> 02:42:41,920
It's fucking... Okay.

3927
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:42,640
Wait.

3928
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:43,720
There's two secrets.

3929
02:42:43,720 --> 02:42:45,240
What the fuck is the secret?

3930
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:46,680
Okay.

3931
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:48,640
Al Capone?

3932
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:49,880
Like...

3933
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:56,120
I don't know if you guys know this, but there were actual parasites in his brain in the end, guys.

3934
02:42:56,360 --> 02:42:58,800
Like he was not okay.

3935
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:01,080
What is the fucking clink?

3936
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:04,180
Oh my god.

3937
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:07,640
Oh, I found him.

3938
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:10,420
Are you a...

3939
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:11,460
Good boy.

3940
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:14,780
Yeah, his brain got like actual...

3941
02:43:14,780 --> 02:43:19,900
Yeah, he got... Guys, if he cared about details, he would not have got syphilis.

3942
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:24,460
The clapping never stops.

3943
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:30,740
Oh no.

3944
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:32,040
The fucking clapping.

3945
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:40,750
Yay.

3946
02:43:40,750 --> 02:43:41,350
Crime.

3947
02:43:42,890 --> 02:43:43,850
Oh my god.

3948
02:43:43,870 --> 02:43:44,430
I'm going crazy.

3949
02:43:44,430 --> 02:43:45,690
I'm fucking going crazy.

3950
02:43:46,030 --> 02:43:46,590
I...

3951
02:43:48,270 --> 02:43:48,550
Oh my god.

3952
02:43:48,550 --> 02:43:49,390
I'm going...

3953
02:43:49,390 --> 02:43:52,450
I'm gonna go fucking crazy with this.

3954
02:43:52,610 --> 02:43:53,030
Stop!

3955
02:43:58,490 --> 02:43:59,310
Okay.

3956
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:00,710
Increase all stats.

3957
02:44:00,950 --> 02:44:04,530
I'm gonna put it all onto... Oh my god.

3958
02:44:04,650 --> 02:44:05,070
Please.

3959
02:44:08,170 --> 02:44:08,990
Please.

3960
02:44:09,610 --> 02:44:10,050
Please.

3961
02:44:16,330 --> 02:44:17,990
Why is it clapping?

3962
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:22,380
Okay.

3963
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:23,300
Where's my bed?

3964
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:25,200
Where the fuck is... Okay, there's my bed.

3965
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:29,080
Oh my god.

3966
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:29,880
The clap.

3967
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:31,500
The clapping don't stop.

3968
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:36,060
Alright.

3969
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:37,720
I think this is a good... Oh wait.

3970
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:40,000
I think this is a good place to call it here.

3971
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:41,940
I didn't realize there was a story.

3972
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:49,520
I thought I was just gonna clean... I thought I was just gonna clean some prime... some fucking prime.

3973
02:44:50,180 --> 02:44:52,520
That's interesting that there's a story in there.

3974
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:54,060
I mean, it's pretty comfy too.

3975
02:44:54,320 --> 02:44:55,700
It's a really comfy game.

3976
02:44:55,940 --> 02:44:58,040
When you have like the right music for it.

3977
02:44:58,180 --> 02:44:58,560
Like...

3978
02:45:00,660 --> 02:45:01,940
When you have...

3979
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:05,800
When you have the right music to go along with the...

3980
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,320
with the game.

3981
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:09,520
It gets really comfy.

3982
02:45:10,380 --> 02:45:11,680
Um... Oh my god.

3983
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:15,520
That was really fun.

3984
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:16,660
I really enjoyed it.

3985
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:18,280
Um... I've been meaning to play...

3986
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:23,440
I was like thinking about either like Power Wash Simulator or... or Crime Scene Cleaner.

3987
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:26,040
So I'm glad I went with Crime Scene Cleaner.

3988
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,040
I had a really good time playing the game.

3989
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:29,020
I hope you guys do too.

3990
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:30,360
Um...

3991
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:31,420
I... Do you know what?

3992
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:33,400
I'm gonna do something crazy guys.

3993
02:45:33,660 --> 02:45:34,580
You guys know what I'm gonna do?

3994
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:36,540
We haven't done this in a long time.

3995
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:38,040
We're gonna...

3996
02:45:38,320 --> 02:45:38,720
We're gonna do...

3997
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:41,280
Donation reading time.

3998
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:42,600
Oh my god.

3999
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:43,940
It's been years.

4000
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:48,960
But I'm feeling it today.

4001
02:45:49,680 --> 02:45:50,920
Oh my god.

4002
02:45:50,960 --> 02:45:52,380
I'm feeling it today.

4003
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:55,920
We're gonna actually read all the Super Chats today guys.

4004
02:45:56,620 --> 02:45:57,540
Um... Alright.

4005
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:58,740
Let's go from the very beginning.

4006
02:45:58,880 --> 02:45:59,400
Let me...

4007
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:01,000
Move all the way.

4008
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:02,360
Fan funding.

4009
02:46:04,120 --> 02:46:04,720
Um...

4010
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:06,320
Micah, thank you for the Super Chat.

4011
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:06,760
Thank you.

4012
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:07,320
Thank you.

4013
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:08,040
Get well soon.

4014
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:08,600
Dad.

4015
02:46:09,180 --> 02:46:09,740
Well...

4016
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:11,640
He doesn't need to get well soon.

4017
02:46:11,780 --> 02:46:13,800
It's more so of like...

4018
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:14,520
Uh...

4019
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:18,120
It's more so of like...

4020
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:20,340
You know... He needs to...

4021
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:21,460
Oh, Sonia saved my name.

4022
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:24,140
He just needs to live with it.

4023
02:46:24,280 --> 02:46:26,820
Like... That's really it.

4024
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:31,520
He just has to live with it because of his allergies.

4025
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:32,300
So like...

4026
02:46:32,300 --> 02:46:33,580
There's no get well.

4027
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:34,320
He's just...

4028
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:35,540
It's like... Survive.

4029
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:37,780
Thank you for the Super Chat.

4030
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:38,200
Thank you.

4031
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:38,800
Thank you.

4032
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:39,740
Um...

4033
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:40,160
Andy!

4034
02:46:40,360 --> 02:46:41,460
Thank you for the Super Chat.

4035
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:41,880
Thank you.

4036
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:42,480
Thank you.

4037
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:43,620
Doki on the Smartphone.

4038
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:44,780
New York Mets Playoff.

4039
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:45,640
Baseball on the TV.

4040
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:46,720
A great evening.

4041
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:47,660
Thank you for the Super Chat.

4042
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:48,080
Thank you.

4043
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:48,700
Thank you.

4044
02:46:50,380 --> 02:46:50,780
Um...

4045
02:46:50,780 --> 02:46:51,760
Ghost Rider.

4046
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:52,680
Thank you for the Super Chat.

4047
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:53,040
Thank you.

4048
02:46:53,060 --> 02:46:53,700
Thank you.

4049
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:54,400
Ivan.

4050
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:56,940
Why does Dad have the infinity stones of allergies?

4051
02:46:57,040 --> 02:46:58,020
Thank you for the Super Chat.

4052
02:46:58,080 --> 02:46:58,400
Thank you.

4053
02:46:58,420 --> 02:46:58,760
Thank you.

4054
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:00,180
It's just purebreds.

4055
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:02,000
Um... Like...

4056
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,900
Yeah, the... You get like a fancier dog.

4057
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:05,980
Like... Okay.

4058
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:11,700
The worst part is that you pay more to have a more fucked up dog.

4059
02:47:12,020 --> 02:47:15,880
So like... I think that's a little... That's like... Where it's... You know...

4060
02:47:15,880 --> 02:47:16,500
A little...

4061
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:20,600
That's the concern here.

4062
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:21,980
That's the...

4063
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:24,200
That's the concern here.

4064
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:26,180
And it's like...

4065
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:27,760
It's not just like wiener dogs.

4066
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,600
It's like every type of breed.

4067
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:33,740
Because... Yes, the genetics you're getting are purebred.

4068
02:47:33,960 --> 02:47:38,240
But like... The thing about like... If we look at history... Um...

4069
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:40,320
If we look at history...

4070
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:42,540
Um... You know, like real people.

4071
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:43,620
Like... What's his name?

4072
02:47:43,720 --> 02:47:44,400
King Tut.

4073
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:45,980
From like...

4074
02:47:45,980 --> 02:47:48,600
In the... From the Egypt times.

4075
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:49,640
Like...

4076
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:51,740
Yeah, like... He...

4077
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:54,160
He's like really famous in Egyptian history.

4078
02:47:54,440 --> 02:47:56,520
But he had a lot of genetic issues.

4079
02:47:56,720 --> 02:48:00,840
Like... Because his like... His family line were just brothers and sisters.

4080
02:48:01,280 --> 02:48:04,460
Banging each other to keep the line royal.

4081
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:08,000
And apparently he had like a lot of fucking issues.

4082
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:10,900
And that's why he died really really young.

4083
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:13,760
Because the inbreeding was so fucking bad.

4084
02:48:14,560 --> 02:48:15,160
Um...

4085
02:48:15,160 --> 02:48:21,580
Um... So we take that and apply it to dogs.

4086
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:27,100
Uh... Because we're like... We wanna have this specific dog breed.

4087
02:48:27,400 --> 02:48:28,320
Like they're like...

4088
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:29,980
So like wiener dogs...

4089
02:48:29,980 --> 02:48:32,380
Um... Have like a lot of issues.

4090
02:48:32,780 --> 02:48:35,880
In the point where like... You know... Uh...

4091
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:39,840
Uh... You can get cases where like... You know...

4092
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:42,220
They're more likely to be allergic to life.

4093
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:43,940
Because of their...

4094
02:48:43,940 --> 02:48:47,020
Uh... Because of the genetic freak that they are.

4095
02:48:47,380 --> 02:48:49,560
Cause dogs aren't supposed to be that long.

4096
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:57,360
Dogs... Dogs aren't supposed to be that long.

4097
02:48:57,540 --> 02:49:00,360
But then we are like... But they're so cute.

4098
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:03,080
So... Look how tiny they are.

4099
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,640
And how long they are.

4100
02:49:06,160 --> 02:49:06,180
Like...

4101
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:11,820
And then you're just like... They were bred to hunt badgers in holes.

4102
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:13,940
And that's why they're... Okay.

4103
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:15,400
I don't understand why they're that long.

4104
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:15,840
Like...

4105
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:17,780
They can literally be like...

4106
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:20,600
They don't have to be that long to hunt badgers.

4107
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:22,300
They just have to be that short.

4108
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:24,380
Um... So like...

4109
02:49:24,380 --> 02:49:25,120
Yes.

4110
02:49:25,160 --> 02:49:26,020
I'm part of the problem.

4111
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:29,100
I'm part of the problem cause I still bought a wiener dog.

4112
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:31,420
But I... I still...

4113
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:33,180
At least I didn't buy a pug.

4114
02:49:33,260 --> 02:49:35,940
Cause that's the biggest... Like pugs are like... Even.

4115
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:36,380
worse.

4116
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:37,500
But like...

4117
02:49:38,080 --> 02:49:42,760
There's a reason... They're really short because they have to be that short to chase badgers out.

4118
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:44,080
And that's why they're short.

4119
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:45,920
But I don't understand the long part.

4120
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:48,220
But like they look cute when they're long.

4121
02:49:48,460 --> 02:49:50,540
So like... Um...

4122
02:49:50,540 --> 02:49:56,500
So that's why like usually purebred dogs have like a whole lot of issues.

4123
02:49:56,820 --> 02:50:01,280
Because like to keep them pure, genetically there's something wrong.

4124
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:02,120
Like...

4125
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:05,040
Oh yeah.

4126
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:05,520
Golden...

4127
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:07,740
Golden retrievers have hip issues.

4128
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:08,200
Like...

4129
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:08,780
There's a lot.

4130
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:10,080
You're supposed to be...

4131
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:11,800
The more diverse...

4132
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:14,060
The more mixed breeding you do...

4133
02:50:14,060 --> 02:50:16,160
The healthier the dog is.

4134
02:50:16,340 --> 02:50:17,760
Or like animals in general.

4135
02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:21,860
The healthier the animal is if you like mix the breeds up.

4136
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:25,640
Because of the genetic diversity that comes into it.

4137
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:28,780
So like... But we don't do that because we're like that's not cute.

4138
02:50:28,940 --> 02:50:29,380
So...

4139
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:31,100
We're the problem here.

4140
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:32,060
Um...

4141
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:34,140
We're the problem.

4142
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:35,540
Cause we're like but that's not cute.

4143
02:50:36,160 --> 02:50:36,340
So...

4144
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:39,820
Sometimes they can be cute.

4145
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:43,100
Sometimes they can be cute and then they create a new type of breed.

4146
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:48,620
But there's sometimes there's some types of dogs that are like you should not mix them together.

4147
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:50,240
Because it's just not it.

4148
02:50:50,380 --> 02:50:51,340
Like it's just...

4149
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:53,080
It's just not it.

4150
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:53,640
Like...

4151
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:59,180
There's some dog breeds out there where I was like oh...

4152
02:50:59,180 --> 02:51:00,740
I don't know why.

4153
02:51:01,480 --> 02:51:01,960
Like...

4154
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:03,560
It's just not it.

4155
02:51:03,980 --> 02:51:04,460
Like...

4156
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:07,480
Thank you for the super chat.

4157
02:51:07,580 --> 02:51:07,860
Thank you.

4158
02:51:07,860 --> 02:51:08,400
Thank you.

4159
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:12,780
Thank you for the super chat.

4160
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:13,300
Thank you.

4161
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:13,980
Thank you.

4162
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,760
Hey don't diss my little Cavapoos.

4163
02:51:16,820 --> 02:51:18,280
What the fuck is a Cavapoo?

4164
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:20,360
What the fuck?

4165
02:51:21,560 --> 02:51:23,660
What the fuck is a Cavapoo?

4166
02:51:23,820 --> 02:51:24,860
Oh those!

4167
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:28,420
I don't like those types of dog breeds.

4168
02:51:28,660 --> 02:51:28,760
I'm...

4169
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:31,460
Okay.

4170
02:51:31,700 --> 02:51:36,940
The reason why is that them and Toy Poodles...

4171
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:41,180
I see them... It was like a huge thing in Asia.

4172
02:51:41,380 --> 02:51:43,600
So I saw them everywhere.

4173
02:51:43,880 --> 02:51:48,940
Like everybody I knew owned either that or a Toy Poodle.

4174
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:51,340
Like it looked exactly like that.

4175
02:51:51,460 --> 02:51:52,560
It was everywhere.

4176
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:54,820
Like nobody owned any other dog.

4177
02:51:55,020 --> 02:51:57,680
Like it was literally that or Toy Poodles.

4178
02:51:57,760 --> 02:52:01,700
And I was like... I was so tired of seeing those fucking dogs.

4179
02:52:01,960 --> 02:52:02,820
And like...

4180
02:52:04,060 --> 02:52:05,740
I know it's not their fault.

4181
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:09,440
But I was so fucking tired of seeing those dogs.

4182
02:52:10,520 --> 02:52:11,800
I was just like...

4183
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:13,560
It was just everywhere.

4184
02:52:13,780 --> 02:52:15,040
There's no other dog.

4185
02:52:15,380 --> 02:52:17,160
It was just those breeds.

4186
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:20,460
Because they're like really popular on social media.

4187
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:23,500
They're really popular in social media.

4188
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:25,240
So everybody owns one.

4189
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:28,160
Like everybody I knew who had a dog owned one.

4190
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:33,200
And then like I would like walk around like walking my wiener dog.

4191
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:36,100
And then like I just see those dogs and they're just everywhere.

4192
02:52:36,340 --> 02:52:37,640
I'm just... There was no diversity.

4193
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:41,280
There was just no diversity in dogs.

4194
02:52:43,260 --> 02:52:43,660
Um...

4195
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:45,280
Uh...

4196
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:47,000
Thank you for the super chat.

4197
02:52:47,060 --> 02:52:47,360
Thank you.

4198
02:52:47,380 --> 02:52:47,880
Thank you.

4199
02:52:47,880 --> 02:52:49,300
At this rate he'll get into YouTubers.

4200
02:52:49,560 --> 02:52:50,680
Be careful Doki.

4201
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:51,540
Thank you for the super chat.

4202
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:51,900
Thank you.

4203
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:52,360
Thank you.

4204
02:52:52,540 --> 02:52:52,940
Alan.

4205
02:52:53,100 --> 02:52:54,040
Thank you for the super chat.

4206
02:52:54,100 --> 02:52:54,380
Thank you.

4207
02:52:54,400 --> 02:52:54,920
Thank you.

4208
02:52:55,340 --> 02:52:59,680
Thoughts on Deerhead Chihuahua aka the non-ugly Chihuahua.

4209
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:02,540
There's a non-ugly version of a Chihuahua?

4210
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:04,040
What does it look like?

4211
02:53:04,060 --> 02:53:04,180
What does it look like?

4212
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:07,660
Ugh.

4213
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:13,420
Sorry.

4214
02:53:13,640 --> 02:53:13,720
Sorry.

4215
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:14,160
Um...

4216
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:18,680
I mean...

4217
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:19,520
I mean...

4218
02:53:21,740 --> 02:53:22,460
Um...

4219
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:23,460
Um...

4220
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:24,100
It's a dog.

4221
02:53:24,460 --> 02:53:25,800
It's a dog.

4222
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:28,740
Like a...

4223
02:53:28,740 --> 02:53:30,320
It's a dog.

4224
02:53:30,680 --> 02:53:34,900
It's just... It's like a Chihuahua but it's eyes aren't bulging out.

4225
02:53:35,180 --> 02:53:36,580
But like it's still...

4226
02:53:36,580 --> 02:53:38,440
To me it's still a Chihuahua.

4227
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:39,020
Like...

4228
02:53:39,020 --> 02:53:40,800
Um... Like...

4229
02:53:40,800 --> 02:53:42,600
I feel like... Yeah.

4230
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:50,080
It's eyes don't look like it's about to pop out of it's fucking head but it has everything else still of a Chihuahua.

4231
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:52,540
That like is not...

4232
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:54,720
I just don't like Chihuahuas in general.

4233
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:55,980
That's my personal opinion.

4234
02:53:56,880 --> 02:53:59,140
Like I just don't like Chihuahuas.

4235
02:53:59,160 --> 02:53:59,980
I feel like...

4236
02:53:59,980 --> 02:54:02,120
Like they're just little menaces.

4237
02:54:02,740 --> 02:54:03,100
Like...

4238
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:07,120
Um...

4239
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:08,760
Lolly, thank you for the super chat.

4240
02:54:08,820 --> 02:54:09,760
Thank you, thank you.

4241
02:54:09,800 --> 02:54:11,320
Also, Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

4242
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:12,240
Thank you, thank you.

4243
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:13,120
Um...

4244
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:19,700
King Charles II of Spain baffled Christian by continuing to live.

4245
02:54:19,880 --> 02:54:23,220
Also, there are people trying to breed pugs with other breeds to restore their genome.

4246
02:54:23,440 --> 02:54:24,480
Thank you for the super chat.

4247
02:54:24,540 --> 02:54:25,060
Thank you, thank you.

4248
02:54:25,080 --> 02:54:25,840
Yeah, I heard about that.

4249
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:26,920
Oh, I know about King Charles.

4250
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,500
He's the one with the crooked jaw, right?

4251
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:30,640
Yeah, this guy.

4252
02:54:31,100 --> 02:54:31,880
This guy.

4253
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:32,920
I heard about him.

4254
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:35,060
People were like...

4255
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:37,560
He was supposed to die.

4256
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:39,640
But then he survived.

4257
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:42,160
He had... He was like...

4258
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:43,480
He was like...

4259
02:54:43,480 --> 02:54:48,700
Really... And then apparently the painting of him was supposed to make him look good.

4260
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:50,100
Because like...

4261
02:54:50,100 --> 02:54:51,640
He was, you know...

4262
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:54,280
Paintings are supposed to make people look better.

4263
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:55,680
So this was like...

4264
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:59,240
His... This was a painting that was like...

4265
02:54:59,980 --> 02:55:01,660
Sort of like... His good side.

4266
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:05,820
Although like... There's not really a lot to go off of.

4267
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:08,060
But... Um... He had...

4268
02:55:08,060 --> 02:55:09,260
Okay, let me look read up.

4269
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:10,460
I remember reading about him.

4270
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:11,540
King Charles 2.

4271
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:13,440
He had like...

4272
02:55:13,440 --> 02:55:15,360
A lot of stuff going on.

4273
02:55:15,420 --> 02:55:17,220
But he was apparently a really nice guy.

4274
02:55:17,640 --> 02:55:19,440
He was a very nice guy.

4275
02:55:19,580 --> 02:55:21,520
He was just, you know... Genetically.

4276
02:55:21,640 --> 02:55:24,220
He was like... Just...

4277
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:25,600
Yeah...

4278
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:26,840
He was...

4279
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:29,300
There was a lot going on.

4280
02:55:31,940 --> 02:55:32,240
But...

4281
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:34,200
But he was apparently...

4282
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:37,320
Like genetically... What was genetically wrong?

4283
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:38,900
How do I look that up?

4284
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:41,120
Genetically wrong King Charles 2?

4285
02:55:41,680 --> 02:55:42,280
Alright.

4286
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:45,000
That was caused by inbreeding.

4287
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:45,440
Alright.

4288
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:48,180
Based on research suggests... What does he have?

4289
02:55:48,480 --> 02:55:49,720
I know he had like...

4290
02:55:49,720 --> 02:55:51,320
Brain issues too.

4291
02:55:51,660 --> 02:55:52,840
But I don't remember... Oh yeah!

4292
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:53,680
He can't walk.

4293
02:55:54,160 --> 02:55:55,260
He can't walk.

4294
02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:57,240
So he had to use like braces.

4295
02:55:57,600 --> 02:55:58,460
To walk.

4296
02:55:59,020 --> 02:55:59,920
And then...

4297
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:00,840
He...

4298
02:56:00,840 --> 02:56:03,320
He was extremely active physically.

4299
02:56:03,580 --> 02:56:04,900
Well at least he had that.

4300
02:56:05,160 --> 02:56:05,760
He can't walk.

4301
02:56:05,980 --> 02:56:06,840
But at least he was active.

4302
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:07,940
Like...

4303
02:56:10,020 --> 02:56:11,220
What the fuck?

4304
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:16,140
He spent... Sometimes he spent sleeping with his father's body?

4305
02:56:16,940 --> 02:56:17,480
Oh!

4306
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:19,460
Oh...

4307
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:26,460
Like done under doctor's advice that would help him produce... Oh and he can't produce an air.

4308
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:28,060
Yeah!

4309
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:30,060
Yeah...

4310
02:56:32,280 --> 02:56:34,580
Yeah... He's like a liger.

4311
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:35,820
You know?

4312
02:56:35,960 --> 02:56:37,800
Cause like ligers are infertile.

4313
02:56:38,060 --> 02:56:42,600
Because genetically... Genetically like... They're so fucked up.

4314
02:56:42,600 --> 02:56:43,740
They're infertile.

4315
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:45,860
If you mix breeds too much...

4316
02:56:45,860 --> 02:56:48,100
So you forced a breed to mix.

4317
02:56:48,460 --> 02:56:50,000
They're not... They're not fertile.

4318
02:56:50,480 --> 02:56:52,340
So like... He's just a liger.

4319
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:54,140
But like not...

4320
02:56:54,140 --> 02:56:56,440
Not like as good looking.

4321
02:56:56,460 --> 02:56:56,680
No.

4322
02:56:56,780 --> 02:56:58,200
Ligers are pretty fucked up.

4323
02:56:58,300 --> 02:57:00,000
They're like way too big.

4324
02:57:00,280 --> 02:57:01,160
And like...

4325
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:03,720
I don't think ligers look that good.

4326
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,500
For those who don't know what liger is.

4327
02:57:07,740 --> 02:57:11,820
It's when you crossbreed a lion and a tiger together.

4328
02:57:12,220 --> 02:57:13,960
And then you get a...

4329
02:57:13,960 --> 02:57:17,040
A lion-tiger genetic mess.

4330
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:21,560
And you cat... Ligers... Technically ligers...

4331
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:25,680
A male liger is infertile.

4332
02:57:25,700 --> 02:57:26,860
A male liger...

4333
02:57:28,240 --> 02:57:31,660
Cannot be... Cannot be used to make more ligers.

4334
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:35,740
But a female liger can make more...

4335
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:37,900
I guess they're not ligers anymore.

4336
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:43,260
But a female liger can breed with a lion or a tiger.

4337
02:57:43,560 --> 02:57:46,700
So then you can get that type of genetic mess.

4338
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:47,960
I don't know why I know this.

4339
02:57:48,140 --> 02:57:48,480
Like...

4340
02:57:49,220 --> 02:57:51,440
Fun facts with Doki.

4341
02:57:51,860 --> 02:57:53,460
Sharko, thank you for the super chat.

4342
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:53,820
Thank you.

4343
02:57:53,840 --> 02:57:54,360
Thank you.

4344
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:57,380
Why does King Charles look like a VTuber model?

4345
02:57:57,500 --> 02:57:59,360
Don't say that about VTubers.

4346
02:57:59,580 --> 02:58:02,560
Are you trying to say VTubers are infertile?

4347
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:10,180
Are you trying to say VTubers are infertile?

4348
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:11,240
That's fucked up.

4349
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:13,460
You said that.

4350
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:14,500
That's fucked up.

4351
02:58:18,580 --> 02:58:19,120
Um...

4352
02:58:20,060 --> 02:58:20,780
Let's see.

4353
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:21,460
What was I?

4354
02:58:22,540 --> 02:58:24,160
Psychoz, thank you for the super chat.

4355
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:24,540
Thank you.

4356
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:25,040
Thank you.

4357
02:58:25,060 --> 02:58:26,700
Here's a tip for the ear medicine.

4358
02:58:26,800 --> 02:58:30,420
Get a cute girl and treats to distract dad and it'll be easy peasy.

4359
02:58:30,560 --> 02:58:31,440
Oh my god.

4360
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:32,060
So like...

4361
02:58:32,060 --> 02:58:32,340
Okay.

4362
02:58:32,460 --> 02:58:35,040
So I was talking about how like... Okay.

4363
02:58:35,080 --> 02:58:37,620
So he hated the male nurse at the vet.

4364
02:58:37,880 --> 02:58:43,740
But like it was so funny because like the male nurse brought like a jar of treats and then he was fine.

4365
02:58:43,940 --> 02:58:45,260
He was so fucking excited.

4366
02:58:45,940 --> 02:58:51,880
And um... And then like obviously he was like... So the male nurse was trying to teach me how to do the medicine thing.

4367
02:58:51,880 --> 02:58:54,780
And then he put down the jar of treats.

4368
02:58:55,020 --> 02:58:57,060
And the thing is he forgot to put a cover.

4369
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:58,000
And then...

4370
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:01,780
And then dad just bolted to the... Because we were on the...

4371
02:59:01,780 --> 02:59:02,560
He was on the table.

4372
02:59:02,780 --> 02:59:04,120
He was on the fucking table.

4373
02:59:04,220 --> 02:59:05,500
Like the pet examination table.

4374
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:08,860
And he bolted into the jar of treats and stuck his head in there.

4375
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:09,280
He was like...

4376
02:59:10,060 --> 02:59:11,880
And I was like I'm so sorry.

4377
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:14,660
I couldn't grab him in time.

4378
02:59:14,960 --> 02:59:16,620
Because like he let go of him.

4379
02:59:16,780 --> 02:59:20,140
So then I was supposed to grab him after he let go of him.

4380
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:22,540
Because he had to let go and put down his jar of treats.

4381
02:59:22,700 --> 02:59:26,860
And then he just bolted to the jar of treats and stuck his entire head into the jar.

4382
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:32,560
And like he sees the moment in no shit.

4383
02:59:35,060 --> 02:59:38,860
I know he's just incredibly food motivated.

4384
02:59:39,300 --> 02:59:41,000
That's what like the thing is.

4385
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:42,880
I don't know if it's like a wiener dog thing.

4386
02:59:43,020 --> 02:59:44,740
I don't know if it's like a dachshund thing.

4387
02:59:44,980 --> 02:59:50,860
But like I feel like every wiener dog I've owned is incredibly food motivated.

4388
02:59:51,880 --> 02:59:53,040
They just love food.

4389
02:59:53,160 --> 02:59:54,020
They don't care.

4390
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:56,820
They don't care if they've been fed or not.

4391
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:59,060
They just really fucking love food.

4392
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:04,240
So yeah.

4393
03:00:04,440 --> 03:00:05,940
So I was like No!

4394
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:06,880
Stop!

4395
03:00:07,080 --> 03:00:07,600
I'm sorry!

4396
03:00:08,140 --> 03:00:09,440
I'm like I'm so sorry!

4397
03:00:12,520 --> 03:00:14,420
That's just dogs in general.

4398
03:00:16,360 --> 03:00:16,880
Alright.

4399
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:17,580
Let's see.

4400
03:00:19,060 --> 03:00:20,500
Lolly thank you for the super chat.

4401
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:20,920
Thank you.

4402
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:21,540
Thank you.

4403
03:00:21,880 --> 03:00:23,860
Heart the size of a peppercorn.

4404
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:25,020
Lungs corroded.

4405
03:00:25,480 --> 03:00:27,020
Intestines and corroded.

4406
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:28,180
Three kidney stones.

4407
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:29,980
Fluid in the brain.

4408
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:34,120
One testy swollen and black as a coal.

4409
03:00:34,280 --> 03:00:35,580
Jesus Christ.

4410
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:37,820
Oh my god.

4411
03:00:38,700 --> 03:00:39,920
Oh my god.

4412
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:42,800
Poor guy.

4413
03:00:43,220 --> 03:00:44,940
That's like insane.

4414
03:00:46,520 --> 03:00:48,200
Lolly thank you for the super chat.

4415
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:48,520
Thank you.

4416
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:48,960
Thank you.

4417
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:51,780
That's why you don't keep the bloodline pure.

4418
03:00:51,880 --> 03:00:54,420
That is why we don't do that anymore.

4419
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:55,460
Like we don't marry.

4420
03:00:55,680 --> 03:01:00,300
Also like it's really fucked up to marry your fucking sibling or relatives or whatever.

4421
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:04,260
Morally it's also incredibly fucked up.

4422
03:01:04,380 --> 03:01:08,840
But now we have the science to tell you why it's fucked up too.

4423
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:14,180
The bloodline was too pure.

4424
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:18,280
Like now we have both reasons why you shouldn't do that.

4425
03:01:18,580 --> 03:01:21,560
Um Let's see.

4426
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:22,560
Um.

4427
03:01:22,980 --> 03:01:24,360
Chyna thank you for the super chat.

4428
03:01:24,440 --> 03:01:24,720
Thank you.

4429
03:01:24,760 --> 03:01:25,120
Thank you.

4430
03:01:25,140 --> 03:01:27,560
I can't believe Doki is the bay harbor butcher.

4431
03:01:27,700 --> 03:01:29,240
Thank you for the super chat.

4432
03:01:29,340 --> 03:01:29,680
Thank you.

4433
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:30,360
Thank you.

4434
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:34,300
Uh Turtles thank you for the super chat.

4435
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:34,620
Thank you.

4436
03:01:34,640 --> 03:01:35,000
Thank you.

4437
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:36,180
Remember that you're not a fish.

4438
03:01:36,260 --> 03:01:37,100
The hicks should go away.

4439
03:01:37,220 --> 03:01:37,960
Thank you for the super chat.

4440
03:01:38,040 --> 03:01:38,320
Thank you.

4441
03:01:38,340 --> 03:01:38,720
Thank you.

4442
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:40,460
Cypher thank you for the super chat.

4443
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:40,900
Thank you.

4444
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:41,820
Thank you.

4445
03:01:42,580 --> 03:01:43,300
Let's see.

4446
03:01:46,740 --> 03:01:47,100
Um.

4447
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:47,660
Oh yeah.

4448
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:48,280
By the way.

4449
03:01:48,320 --> 03:01:49,440
So like you guys didn't know.

4450
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:50,120
Um.

4451
03:01:50,160 --> 03:01:51,360
I'm gonna be doing an apex tournament.

4452
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:52,160
Um.

4453
03:01:52,240 --> 03:01:53,140
This Saturday.

4454
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:54,500
The Sorry.

4455
03:01:54,660 --> 03:01:58,340
The Riksa 2.0 Apex Invitational.

4456
03:01:58,480 --> 03:02:00,920
I was gonna invite other VTuber.

4457
03:02:00,960 --> 03:02:03,440
I was actually the very last captain spot.

4458
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:04,700
Um.

4459
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:06,940
I was the very last captain slot.

4460
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,860
Because like when I asked like.

4461
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:10,400
When I asked like.

4462
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:10,920
Um.

4463
03:02:11,100 --> 03:02:13,240
I asked somebody if they're doing it.

4464
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:14,340
And then they were like Oh yeah.

4465
03:02:14,480 --> 03:02:15,300
Like I got invited.

4466
03:02:15,640 --> 03:02:16,360
Cause I was trying to.

4467
03:02:16,460 --> 03:02:17,920
Cause I had to find teammates.

4468
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:21,980
I had three days to find teammates.

4469
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:23,680
Cause I got the captain slot.

4470
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:24,980
Um.

4471
03:02:25,020 --> 03:02:29,740
I got the captain slot literally on Thursday.

4472
03:02:30,100 --> 03:02:31,060
Wednesday I think.

4473
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:32,580
I got.

4474
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:33,440
I I got.

4475
03:02:33,480 --> 03:02:36,700
I asked about if there was still slots for captains.

4476
03:02:36,820 --> 03:02:39,100
And I got it on Wednesday.

4477
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:42,340
And I had to find teammates on that Friday.

4478
03:02:42,340 --> 03:02:45,120
Like my deadline for teammates was Friday.

4479
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:50,360
And I was like the last captain basically.

4480
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:52,560
I think I was like one of the last captains.

4481
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:54,120
And I was like asking somebody.

4482
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:55,360
I was like oh yeah like.

4483
03:02:55,700 --> 03:02:56,060
Um.

4484
03:02:56,420 --> 03:02:57,260
Are you doing it?

03:02:57,340 --> 03:02:58,120
And they're like oh yeah.

4486
03:02:58,400 --> 03:02:59,640
I'm one of the captains.

4487
03:02:59,740 --> 03:02:59,920
I'm.

4488
03:03:00,260 --> 03:03:02,500
Like I got the captain slot like a month ago.

4489
03:03:02,720 --> 03:03:04,080
And I was like A MONTH AGO?

4490
03:03:05,780 --> 03:03:09,240
I was like That's a fucking month ago.

4491
03:03:15,660 --> 03:03:16,020
So.

4492
03:03:16,020 --> 03:03:16,380
So.

4493
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:17,260
Um.

I was gonna ask like.

03:03:18,660 --> 03:03:21,240
I didn't know how competitive this was.

4496
03:03:21,400 --> 03:03:21,860

4497
03:03:22,040 --> 03:03:23,780

03:03:26,020 --> 03:03:28,540
When I got into the server.

4500
03:03:29,100 --> 03:03:29,660

Cause I was like okay what is like the competition like?

03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:42,900
I don't.

4507
03:03:43,160 --> 03:03:47,220
I saw like literally some teams.

4508
03:03:47,360 --> 03:03:49,900
had like pros in them.

4509
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:52,540
And then like it was like I had full pros or something.

4510
03:03:52,720 --> 03:03:54,180
Or like half pros.

4511
03:03:54,320 --> 03:03:55,940
Like it was like two pros and everything.

4512
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:57,120
Or like no pros.

4513
03:03:57,600 --> 03:03:58,900
And I was like okay.

4514
03:03:59,120 --> 03:03:59,920
There's some.

4515
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:03,040
There's some like actual pro players in here.

4516
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:06,480
Like actual going to like Japan for LAN pro.

4517
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:07,800
So I was like alright.

4518
03:04:07,980 --> 03:04:08,520
I guess.

4519
03:04:08,860 --> 03:04:11,220
I guess I gotta get pros too.

4520
03:04:11,360 --> 03:04:13,800
Cause I don't wanna get absolutely destroyed.

4521
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:14,660
Like.

4522
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:18,440
So.

4523
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:20,420
So I was like.

4524
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:21,340
So I got.

4525
03:04:21,420 --> 03:04:22,240
I got effect.

4526
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:23,380
The reason why.

4527
03:04:23,520 --> 03:04:24,280
Okay it was originally.

4528
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:26,060
Okay the team was originally.

4529
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:27,360
Um.

4530
03:04:27,460 --> 03:04:28,100
The team.

4531
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:30,460
And also like I haven't played Apex in a while too.

4532
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:31,800
So I was like Ah shit.

4533
03:04:31,920 --> 03:04:34,020
Like a lot of the people that were in the tournament.

4534
03:04:34,120 --> 03:04:35,120
They play Apex regularly.

4535
03:04:35,560 --> 03:04:36,880
Like every fucking day.

4536
03:04:37,060 --> 03:04:38,620
And I've been like whoa.

4537
03:04:39,060 --> 03:04:41,420
Like I've not been consistent.

4538
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:44,300
So it was gonna be effect.

4539
03:04:45,300 --> 03:04:46,560
And gen burden.

4540
03:04:47,360 --> 03:04:47,620
Um.

4541
03:04:47,780 --> 03:04:48,900
So originally.

4542
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:51,520
I was gonna be effect and gen burden.

4543
03:04:51,800 --> 03:04:52,280
Um.

4544
03:04:52,420 --> 03:04:53,660
Because like uh.

4545
03:04:54,020 --> 03:04:56,620
Gen burden has wanted to play with me again.

4546
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:58,300
And I was like Oh I have this tournament invite.

4547
03:04:58,540 --> 03:04:59,960
And then he almost joined.

4548
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:01,960
But because it was at.

4549
03:05:02,100 --> 03:05:04,380
But when we realized what time it is.

4550
03:05:04,660 --> 03:05:07,400
It would be 5 in the morning for him in Australia.

4551
03:05:07,800 --> 03:05:09,560
So I was like Ah shit.

4552
03:05:09,700 --> 03:05:09,880
Like.

4553
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:13,100
He's like yeah I can't do 5 in the morning.

4554
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:15,920
He's like I'm sorry I'm in Australia right now.

4555
03:05:15,980 --> 03:05:16,580
I can't do.

4556
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:18,500
I can't do 5 in the morning.

4557
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:22,460
So effect was like oh yes we can get unlucky.

4558
03:05:22,940 --> 03:05:23,340
Um.

4559
03:05:23,540 --> 03:05:24,500
Cause he's down to play.

4560
03:05:24,620 --> 03:05:25,260
So I was like yeah alright.

4561
03:05:25,400 --> 03:05:28,240

Two thirds of alliance.

4567
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:38,160
We're just missing Hakkas.

4568
03:05:38,760 --> 03:05:40,940
We're literally just missing Hakkas.

4569
03:05:41,400 --> 03:05:41,880
Um.

4570
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:44,120
So for those who don't know.

4571
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:46,280
For those who don't know.

4572
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:50,120

So Um.

4577
03:06:01,360 --> 03:06:02,380
So basically.

4578
03:06:02,680 --> 03:06:04,380

4579
03:06:04,580 --> 03:06:09,180

Um.

4584
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:23,840
So the reason why I asked effect is that Effect and I We were originally gonna do a Tournament together.

4585
03:06:24,380 --> 03:06:24,900
Um.

4586
03:06:25,280 --> 03:06:27,320

And like effect Actually told me that he really enjoyed my streams.

4588

03:06:36,120 --> 03:06:38,960
And like I think like he likes watching me.

4591
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:42,020
And like he was like I really wanted to play with you In the future again.

4592
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:43,540
So he was like Before then.

4593
03:06:43,600 --> 03:06:44,220
Before I came back.

4594
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:46,700
Like he was like Super hyped about playing with me.

4595
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:48,320

03:09:43,800 --> 03:09:44,180
So I was like.

4688
03:09:44,240 --> 03:09:44,700
Ah shit.

4689
03:09:44,760 --> 03:09:45,680
Who did I get A third.

4690
03:09:45,880 --> 03:09:46,960
And then I asked Effect.

4691
03:09:47,280 --> 03:09:47,700
Cause like.

4692
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:50,240
Literally I had to finalize Teams by Friday.

4693
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:52,260
So I had to.

4694
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:55,360
I had to Finalize teams by Friday.

4695
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:56,200
And I was like.

4696
03:09:56,280 --> 03:09:57,580

03:10:00,080 --> 03:10:00,780
Like cause they're in Japan.

4700
03:10:01,080 --> 03:10:01,480
Apparently.

4701
03:10:01,860 --> 03:10:02,260
Uh.

4702
03:10:02,420 --> 03:10:03,540
They're in Japan right now.

4703
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:04,120
Together.

4704
03:10:04,240 --> 03:10:05,200
Doing something for alliance.

4705
03:10:05,580 --> 03:10:06,020
And we're like.

4706
03:10:06,080 --> 03:10:06,540
Yeah I'll grab.

4707
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:07,260
I'll grab Unlucky.

4708
03:10:07,360 --> 03:10:08,040
He's totally down.

4709
03:10:08,120 --> 03:10:08,360
So I was like.

4710
03:10:08,420 --> 03:10:08,820
Yeah alright.

4711
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:09,400
Fuck it.

4712
03:10:09,580 --> 03:10:10,040
Let's go.

4713
03:10:10,340 --> 03:10:11,360
Two thirds of alliance.

4714
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:12,220
Like it's not.

4715
03:10:12,580 --> 03:10:13,360
People were like.

4716
03:10:13,460 --> 03:10:14,340
What the fuck.

4717
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:15,000
And then when I.

4718
03:10:15,400 --> 03:10:16,980
Cause we had to report our teams.

4719
03:10:17,260 --> 03:10:18,120
And everybody.

4720
03:10:18,520 --> 03:10:18,800
Like.

4721
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:20,020
A lot of people.

4722
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:21,380
When they saw my team.

4723
03:10:21,560 --> 03:10:21,880
They're like.

4724
03:10:22,040 --> 03:10:22,920
What the fuck.

4725
03:10:23,640 --> 03:10:24,680
Cause they're like.

4726
03:10:24,820 --> 03:10:25,360
I was.

4727
03:10:25,420 --> 03:10:26,060
What the fuck.

4728
03:10:26,060 --> 03:10:26,720
That's not fair.

4729
03:10:26,920 --> 03:10:27,100
And I'm like.

4730
03:10:27,160 --> 03:10:27,600
What do you mean.

4731
03:10:33,590 --> 03:10:34,330
I was like.

4732
03:10:34,430 --> 03:10:35,730
You can't do that to me.

4733
03:10:35,810 --> 03:10:37,510
Other teams also have Pro players.

4734
03:10:37,750 --> 03:10:38,130
You can't.

4735
03:10:43,350 --> 03:10:45,050
I just wanna chill.

4736
03:10:45,050 --> 03:10:45,790
I.

4737
03:10:45,810 --> 03:10:49,210
I don't wanna have a terrible time too.

4738
03:10:49,510 --> 03:10:50,030
Like.

4739
03:10:50,170 --> 03:10:52,670
Your pro player is different.

4740
03:10:52,870 --> 03:10:53,410
Doki.

4741
03:10:54,090 --> 03:10:56,590
There were other pro players too.

4742
03:10:59,210 --> 03:10:59,910
Look.

4743
03:11:02,250 --> 03:11:02,950
Uh.

4744
03:11:03,870 --> 03:11:04,570
Look.

4745
03:11:05,070 --> 03:11:06,770
I also like wanna chill too.

4746
03:11:06,910 --> 03:11:10,110
I don't wanna get like absolutely destroyed as well.

4747
03:11:10,370 --> 03:11:12,370
Like I'm like a huge nerf.

4748
03:11:12,370 --> 03:11:14,430
I haven't played this game in so long.

4749
03:11:14,570 --> 03:11:16,390
I'm literally the debuff right now.

4750
03:11:16,470 --> 03:11:17,950
I didn't even get Hawkus.

4751
03:11:18,170 --> 03:11:20,890
Hawkus is literally the IGL of alliance.

4752
03:11:21,450 --> 03:11:23,030
None of us are IGLs.

4753
03:11:23,110 --> 03:11:24,470
I might have two controller players.

4754
03:11:25,070 --> 03:11:25,890
But like.

4755
03:11:27,510 --> 03:11:29,570
We don't have an IGL.

4756
03:11:29,990 --> 03:11:31,650
I have two roller players.

4757
03:11:32,490 --> 03:11:32,750
Like.

4758
03:11:35,090 --> 03:11:37,250
I'm literally the sandbag.

4759
03:11:37,530 --> 03:11:38,050
Yeah.

4760
03:11:38,090 --> 03:11:38,470
Yeah.

4761
03:11:41,610 --> 03:11:42,190
That's all.

4762
03:11:42,370 --> 03:11:43,230
That's all.

4763
03:11:43,950 --> 03:11:47,270
I'm literally the sandbag of the team.

4764
03:11:48,410 --> 03:11:48,890
Uh.

4765
03:11:51,130 --> 03:11:51,850
Anyway.

4766
03:11:52,770 --> 03:11:53,390
Um.

4767
03:11:54,310 --> 03:11:55,030
Anyway.

4768
03:11:55,090 --> 03:11:55,470
So.

4769
03:11:55,570 --> 03:11:55,930
Yeah.

4770
03:11:56,030 --> 03:11:57,850
That's how the team came to be.

4771
03:11:58,030 --> 03:11:58,510
Um.

4772
03:11:58,910 --> 03:11:59,370
And.

4773
03:12:00,030 --> 03:12:02,130
Your team is already broken.

4774
03:12:02,690 --> 03:12:05,850
Some teams have fucking IGLs.

4775
03:12:06,630 --> 03:12:10,810
Some of the pro player teams have an actual IGL.

4776
03:12:11,270 --> 03:12:13,330
We don't have an IGL.

4777
03:12:13,930 --> 03:12:14,530
Like.

4778
03:12:19,270 --> 03:12:19,870
Anyway.

4779
03:12:20,210 --> 03:12:20,770
So.

4780
03:12:20,850 --> 03:12:21,410
That's how.

4781
03:12:22,150 --> 03:12:22,450
Okay.

4782
03:12:22,590 --> 03:12:22,770
So.

4783
03:12:22,850 --> 03:12:24,190
Because I haven't played.

4784
03:12:24,870 --> 03:12:26,030
And how many.

4785
03:12:26,130 --> 03:12:26,430
Okay.

4786
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:26,670
Look.

4787
03:12:26,810 --> 03:12:28,150
It might be two controller players.

4788
03:12:28,330 --> 03:12:29,950
But they nerfed controller guys.

4789
03:12:30,270 --> 03:12:33,090
They nerfed controller guys.

4790
03:12:33,490 --> 03:12:34,010
Like.

4791
03:12:34,070 --> 03:12:34,890
It's not that strong.

4792
03:12:35,170 --> 03:12:36,970
It's not that strong.

4793
03:12:37,450 --> 03:12:38,030
Um.

4794
03:12:39,190 --> 03:12:41,070
I have the best soldier.

4795
03:12:41,090 --> 03:12:43,150
They only have commanders.

4796
03:12:43,750 --> 03:12:44,230
Um.

4797
03:12:46,330 --> 03:12:46,810
Hey.

4798
03:12:47,270 --> 03:12:47,750
Guys.

4799
03:12:47,950 --> 03:12:48,230
Okay.

4800
03:12:48,290 --> 03:12:48,510
So.

4801
03:12:48,630 --> 03:12:49,050
Yeah.

4802
03:12:49,110 --> 03:12:49,490
That's how.

4803
03:12:49,590 --> 03:12:49,990
Basically.

4804
03:12:50,270 --> 03:12:50,710
And I'm.

4805
03:12:50,710 --> 03:12:50,890
Okay.

4806
03:12:51,090 --> 03:12:51,570
Because.

4807
03:12:51,710 --> 03:12:52,170
Because.

4808
03:12:52,230 --> 03:12:52,450
Like.

4809
03:12:52,530 --> 03:12:52,870
I realize.

4810
03:12:53,030 --> 03:12:53,450
Oh shit.

4811
03:12:53,490 --> 03:12:53,670
Like.

4812
03:12:53,750 --> 03:12:54,230
You know.

4813
03:12:54,550 --> 03:12:55,350
It's not as.

4814
03:12:55,450 --> 03:12:58,510
The teams aren't as intense as Twitch Rivals.

4815
03:12:58,670 --> 03:13:00,770
Cause Twitch Rivals it's like literally all pros.

4816
03:13:01,290 --> 03:13:01,770
Uh.

4817
03:13:02,030 --> 03:13:03,490
It's literally all pros.

4818
03:13:03,890 --> 03:13:04,430
And like.

4819
03:13:04,790 --> 03:13:05,270
Uh.

4820
03:13:05,350 --> 03:13:07,810
So it's not as hard as Twitch Rivals.

4821
03:13:08,090 --> 03:13:08,730
So I was like.

4822
03:13:08,890 --> 03:13:09,730
Oh shit.

4823
03:13:09,810 --> 03:13:11,350
There's like regular players like me.

4824
03:13:12,370 --> 03:13:15,110
So that means there's a chance that I can actually like.

4825
03:13:15,290 --> 03:13:15,790
You know.

4826
03:13:16,030 --> 03:13:17,950
Have an actual 1v1.

4827
03:13:19,170 --> 03:13:22,170
Instead of playing against full pros.

4828
03:13:22,530 --> 03:13:25,730
Because in Twitch Rivals I'm always playing against pro players.

4829
03:13:25,910 --> 03:13:27,430
So it's so fucking scary.

4830
03:13:28,010 --> 03:13:28,290
Like.

4831
03:13:28,530 --> 03:13:30,250
It's so fucking scary.

4832
03:13:30,770 --> 03:13:31,310
So.

4833
03:13:31,610 --> 03:13:32,170
Um.

4834
03:13:33,510 --> 03:13:34,530
So I was like.

4835
03:13:34,730 --> 03:13:35,190
Oh yeah.

4836
03:13:35,310 --> 03:13:35,570
Like.

4837
03:13:35,610 --> 03:13:36,350
This time.

4838
03:13:36,430 --> 03:13:36,770
You know.

4839
03:13:36,810 --> 03:13:38,610
There's a chance to survive.

4840
03:13:39,070 --> 03:13:39,490
Like.

4841
03:13:39,490 --> 03:13:40,310
So I was like.

4842
03:13:40,370 --> 03:13:40,570
Okay.

4843
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:42,190
I should actually practice Apex.

4844
03:13:42,370 --> 03:13:44,570
So the past couple of days.

4845
03:13:44,670 --> 03:13:45,870
The past couple of days.

4846
03:13:46,150 --> 03:13:46,410
Um.

4847
03:13:46,610 --> 03:13:48,170
I've been playing Apex.

4848
03:13:48,410 --> 03:13:48,970
And I.

4849
03:13:49,350 --> 03:13:49,950
I don't.

4850
03:13:50,010 --> 03:13:50,330
Okay.

4851
03:13:50,370 --> 03:13:50,830
So like.

4852
03:13:50,910 --> 03:13:51,450
At one point.

4853
03:13:51,510 --> 03:13:52,190
Last night.

4854
03:13:52,250 --> 03:13:54,450
I was playing Apex at like 4 in the morning.

4855
03:13:54,870 --> 03:13:55,530
But like.

4856
03:13:55,710 --> 03:13:56,430
Yesterday night.

4857
03:13:56,610 --> 03:13:56,770
Yeah.

4858
03:13:56,850 --> 03:13:58,510
I was playing Apex at 4 in the morning.

4859
03:13:58,670 --> 03:14:00,110
And I don't know if that's like.

4860
03:14:00,330 --> 03:14:02,050
I don't know if like.

4861
03:14:02,330 --> 03:14:03,630
It's an Apex thing.

4862
03:14:03,950 --> 03:14:04,770
Or like.

4863
03:14:04,930 --> 03:14:05,310
If.

4864
03:14:05,810 --> 03:14:06,810
It's an Apex thing.

4865
03:14:06,910 --> 03:14:07,730
Or it's been like.

4866
03:14:07,890 --> 03:14:08,570
Or if like.

4867
03:14:08,610 --> 03:14:09,770
People are just leveling up.

4868
03:14:09,770 --> 03:14:11,550
They're leveling up accounts to sell.

4869
03:14:11,750 --> 03:14:12,310
Because.

4870
03:14:12,690 --> 03:14:13,250
I.

4871
03:14:13,550 --> 03:14:14,450
I like.

4872
03:14:14,470 --> 03:14:14,990
Bumped it.

4873
03:14:15,090 --> 03:14:15,610
I had like.

4874
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:16,810
Bots on my team.

4875
03:14:16,910 --> 03:14:17,210
Like.

4876
03:14:17,270 --> 03:14:18,470
Actual Bots.

4877
03:14:19,010 --> 03:14:21,250
I've never had that before.

4878
03:14:21,430 --> 03:14:21,670
Like.

4879
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:22,570
I'd never played.

4880
03:14:22,630 --> 03:14:24,410
I haven't played Apex at extremely.

4881
03:14:25,110 --> 03:14:25,970
DJ night.

4882
03:14:26,770 --> 03:14:27,590
But like.

4883
03:14:27,830 --> 03:14:29,750
I got bots on my team.

4884
03:14:29,910 --> 03:14:30,570
And like.

4885
03:14:30,650 --> 03:14:32,630
Bots on enemy teams too.

4886
03:14:32,850 --> 03:14:33,570
So like.

4887
03:14:33,650 --> 03:14:34,710
It's very easy to spot.

4888
03:14:34,990 --> 03:14:35,350
Because.

4889
03:14:35,730 --> 03:14:36,250
Um.

4890
03:14:37,170 --> 03:14:39,130
They would have no badges.

4891
03:14:39,770 --> 03:14:40,590
And they will pick.

4892
03:14:41,550 --> 03:14:41,950
Lifeline.

4893
03:14:42,510 --> 03:14:42,910
Bloodhound.

4894
03:14:42,970 --> 03:14:43,750
Or Bangalore.

4895
03:14:44,270 --> 03:14:44,870
And like.

4896
03:14:45,150 --> 03:14:46,650
But I don't know if it's like.

4897
03:14:46,770 --> 03:14:48,070
Apex that's doing it.

4898
03:14:48,130 --> 03:14:48,570
Or like.

4899
03:14:49,370 --> 03:14:51,690
I don't know if the game is doing it.

4900
03:14:52,130 --> 03:14:52,530
Or.

4901
03:14:52,710 --> 03:14:53,110
Um.

4902
03:14:53,330 --> 03:14:53,890
Or like.

4903
03:14:53,950 --> 03:14:57,170
If it's other people trying to level up their account.

4904
03:14:57,350 --> 03:14:57,530
Like.

4905
03:14:57,550 --> 03:14:58,610
Level up accounts to sell.

4906
03:14:58,750 --> 03:14:59,410
I can't tell.

4907
03:14:59,950 --> 03:15:00,350
But.

4908
03:15:00,730 --> 03:15:01,130
But.

4909
03:15:01,570 --> 03:15:02,330
Before then.

4910
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:03,030
I.

4911
03:15:03,130 --> 03:15:04,090
When I used like.

4912
03:15:04,230 --> 03:15:04,750
You know like.

4913
03:15:04,910 --> 03:15:05,470
Maybe like.

4914
03:15:05,570 --> 03:15:06,190
Two years ago.

4915
03:15:06,270 --> 03:15:06,770
Or a year ago.

4916
03:15:08,130 --> 03:15:08,910
A year ago.

4917
03:15:10,490 --> 03:15:12,270
That would never happen at four in the morning.

4918
03:15:12,410 --> 03:15:13,310
So I was so confused.

4919
03:15:13,610 --> 03:15:15,130
And it's like every game.

4920
03:15:15,250 --> 03:15:16,710
It's every fucking game.

4921
03:15:17,450 --> 03:15:18,270
That's the thing.

4922
03:15:18,290 --> 03:15:19,170
It's every game.

4923
03:15:19,310 --> 03:15:20,010
And they would like.

4924
03:15:20,090 --> 03:15:20,950
They would just like.

4925
03:15:21,050 --> 03:15:22,050
They all land.

4926
03:15:22,170 --> 03:15:23,690
And you would see so many of them.

4927
03:15:23,810 --> 03:15:25,530
I had like games where like.

4928
03:15:25,690 --> 03:15:28,730
I had games where my entire team were bots.

4929
03:15:29,610 --> 03:15:30,050
Like.

4930
03:15:30,150 --> 03:15:31,310
They were all bots.

4931
03:15:31,590 --> 03:15:31,810
Like.

4932
03:15:33,410 --> 03:15:34,450
And then they all.

4933
03:15:34,810 --> 03:15:37,170
And then you see other bots also landing.

4934
03:15:37,430 --> 03:15:37,970
Cause they don't.

4935
03:15:37,970 --> 03:15:38,430
They don't do.

4936
03:15:38,450 --> 03:15:39,210
Be jump master.

4937
03:15:39,270 --> 03:15:40,030
They're not jump master.

4938
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:41,310
They're literally like just.

4939
03:15:41,330 --> 03:15:41,970
You know.

4940
03:15:42,010 --> 03:15:42,870
They just land there.

4941
03:15:43,030 --> 03:15:43,550
I'm like.

4942
03:15:43,610 --> 03:15:44,370
What the fuck?

4943
03:15:44,650 --> 03:15:44,830
Like.

4944
03:15:45,250 --> 03:15:46,210
Just be like.

4945
03:15:46,870 --> 03:15:47,350
What?

4946
03:15:50,210 --> 03:15:51,750
And then when they die.

4947
03:15:52,010 --> 03:15:53,590
They just insta dc.

4948
03:15:54,090 --> 03:15:55,930
They insta dc when they're dead.

4949
03:15:56,170 --> 03:15:56,550
So I.

4950
03:15:56,650 --> 03:15:57,750
It was so confusing.

4951
03:15:57,870 --> 03:15:58,910
I couldn't tell.

4952
03:15:59,050 --> 03:16:01,890
I couldn't tell if it came from the game itself.

4953
03:16:02,470 --> 03:16:02,810
Like.

4954
03:16:02,870 --> 03:16:05,010
You know how like Fortnite adds bots to the game.

4955
03:16:05,190 --> 03:16:08,630
So I couldn't tell if it's Apex adding bots to the servers.

4956
03:16:08,970 --> 03:16:10,330
Or if it's like.

4957
03:16:10,410 --> 03:16:13,250
Or if it's like people trying to farm.

4958
03:16:13,430 --> 03:16:14,310
Farm like.

4959
03:16:14,570 --> 03:16:15,730
Farm accounts.

4960
03:16:16,410 --> 03:16:18,030
I can't couldn't tell.

4961
03:16:18,270 --> 03:16:18,850
I couldn't.

4962
03:16:19,710 --> 03:16:20,310
Yeah.

4963
03:16:21,430 --> 03:16:23,230
I just couldn't tell.

4964
03:16:23,290 --> 03:16:24,110
They don't do anything.

4965
03:16:24,490 --> 03:16:26,170
They don't do anything.

4966
03:16:26,670 --> 03:16:27,770
So it's been like.

4967
03:16:27,930 --> 03:16:29,530
It was fucking wild.

4968
03:16:29,670 --> 03:16:31,050
I was so frustrated too.

4969
03:16:31,290 --> 03:16:34,830
I was so frustrated cause I wanted like a real player on my team.

4970
03:16:35,610 --> 03:16:36,930
I just wanted a real player.

4971
03:16:40,330 --> 03:16:41,590
Lolly thank you for the super chat.

4972
03:16:41,690 --> 03:16:41,930
Thank you.

4973
03:16:41,970 --> 03:16:42,290
Thank you.

4974
03:16:42,310 --> 03:16:45,050
Remember when you were in beta and thought the devs were bots.

4975
03:16:45,870 --> 03:16:46,270
Yeah.

4976
03:16:46,690 --> 03:16:47,470
That's the thing.

4977
03:16:47,530 --> 03:16:48,270
I can't tell.

4978
03:16:48,450 --> 03:16:50,370
I can't tell what's real anymore.

4979
03:16:50,730 --> 03:16:55,490
I can't tell what's real and what's fake anymore.

4980
03:16:58,190 --> 03:16:59,730
But thank you for the super chat.

4981
03:16:59,850 --> 03:17:00,170
Thank you.

4982
03:17:00,190 --> 03:17:00,870
Thank you.

4983
03:17:02,090 --> 03:17:03,590
Magic thank you for the super chat.

4984
03:17:03,650 --> 03:17:03,910
Thank you.

4985
03:17:03,910 --> 03:17:04,270
Thank you.

4986
03:17:04,390 --> 03:17:05,490
Archaeologist asked me something.

4987
03:17:05,610 --> 03:17:06,730
This question very often.

4988
03:17:06,790 --> 03:17:07,610
Thank you for the super chat.

4989
03:17:07,690 --> 03:17:08,030
Thank you.

4990
03:17:08,090 --> 03:17:08,570
Thank you.

4991
03:17:08,750 --> 03:17:09,610
Gamer and ghost.

4992
03:17:09,750 --> 03:17:10,850
Thank you for the super chat.

4993
03:17:10,950 --> 03:17:11,250
Thank you.

4994
03:17:11,270 --> 03:17:11,870
Thank you.

4995
03:17:14,010 --> 03:17:15,970
Also I thought this was really funny.

4996
03:17:16,090 --> 03:17:17,130
I want to do this to somebody.

4997
03:17:19,530 --> 03:17:20,730
I saw this.

4998
03:17:20,910 --> 03:17:28,290
I saw this video and I really I really wanted I really wanted to pull this off.

4999
03:17:39,120 --> 03:17:40,120
It's a good video.

5000
03:17:40,120 --> 03:17:42,480
I just want to pull this off on somebody.

5001
03:17:48,240 --> 03:17:53,080
By the way, I saw somebody wearing an actual ninja hoodie in public.

5002
03:17:53,860 --> 03:17:55,240
I can't believe they're real.

5003
03:17:55,480 --> 03:18:04,880
I saw like... I was walking I was walking in Dokey Amber Doge and then literally I got out of the lobby and then somebody had a ninja hoodie.

5004
03:18:05,060 --> 03:18:06,340
And the blue one too.

5005
03:18:06,480 --> 03:18:08,880
The actual blue ninja hoodie.

5006
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:09,700
And they exist.

5007
03:18:10,120 --> 03:18:12,700
And I don't think it was... I think he was a real fan.

5008
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:14,080
It was not ironic.

5009
03:18:14,340 --> 03:18:17,640
It was like a legitimate blue ninja hoodie.

5010
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:20,580
And I was like, holy shit you're real.

5011
03:18:20,760 --> 03:18:22,420
You're actually real.

5012
03:18:22,640 --> 03:18:23,020
Like...

5013
03:18:25,240 --> 03:18:26,280
It was...

5014
03:18:26,280 --> 03:18:27,380
Oh my god.

5015
03:18:27,420 --> 03:18:28,620
You can get this at Walmart?

5016
03:18:29,060 --> 03:18:30,380
Oh my guys.

5017
03:18:30,520 --> 03:18:32,320
You can... Oh my god.

5018
03:18:32,380 --> 03:18:34,500
You can buy this at Walmart.

5019
03:18:34,620 --> 03:18:35,480
Oh my god.

5020
03:18:35,800 --> 03:18:36,320
Like...

5021
03:18:38,960 --> 03:18:40,100
I was so surprised.

5022
03:18:40,120 --> 03:18:42,000
I was like, holy shit they're...

5023
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:44,160
These fans are real people.

5024
03:18:44,340 --> 03:18:45,660
And they wore that...

5025
03:18:45,660 --> 03:18:49,200
The fact that they wore this in public was what surprised me the most.

5026
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:52,720
I saw some guy wear this hoodie in public.

5027
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,120
Like I was...

5028
03:18:54,880 --> 03:18:56,260
I was... I just...

5029
03:18:56,260 --> 03:18:57,280
I couldn't believe it.

5030
03:18:57,400 --> 03:18:57,680
I...

5031
03:19:01,140 --> 03:19:02,140
It like...

5032
03:19:02,140 --> 03:19:04,360
It like freaked me out cause I was like you're real.

5033
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:05,760
You're a real person.

5034
03:19:05,980 --> 03:19:07,120
He was...

5035
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:09,460
He was a university student.

5036
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:12,700
Cause he was carrying that backpack to go to university.

5037
03:19:12,960 --> 03:19:13,260
Like...

5038
03:19:13,960 --> 03:19:16,280
He was wearing a university hoodie.

5039
03:19:16,320 --> 03:19:17,680
I won't say what university it was.

5040
03:19:17,900 --> 03:19:20,020
But he was wearing a university ho...

5041
03:19:20,020 --> 03:19:20,480
Like no sorry.

5042
03:19:20,620 --> 03:19:22,200
He was wearing a university backpack.

5043
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:26,900
He was wearing a university backpack and he had a ninja hoodie on.

5044
03:19:27,200 --> 03:19:28,900
And I was like you're real.

5045
03:19:29,160 --> 03:19:29,580
You're...

5046
03:19:30,420 --> 03:19:30,940
You're...

5047
03:19:32,220 --> 03:19:33,620
You're fucking real.

5048
03:19:33,620 --> 03:19:33,900
You're real.

5049
03:19:37,660 --> 03:19:40,060
Eat, sleep, fortnight, repeat.

5050
03:19:43,400 --> 03:19:43,840
Anyway.

5051
03:19:45,300 --> 03:19:46,620
Sudo, thank you for the super chat.

5052
03:19:46,680 --> 03:19:47,400
Thank you, thank you.

5053
03:19:47,480 --> 03:19:50,160
Been on a transformer kick lately and got me curious.

5054
03:19:50,280 --> 03:19:53,760
If you were a transformer, what would you want your alt mode to be?

5055
03:19:53,860 --> 03:19:55,160
A vehicle or an animal?

5056
03:19:55,280 --> 03:19:56,960
I wanna be a fucking animal.

5057
03:19:57,060 --> 03:20:00,780
I feel like Beast Wars are so fucking sick honestly.

5058
03:20:01,780 --> 03:20:03,300
Not... What's the right guy?

5059
03:20:03,620 --> 03:20:04,060
Rattrap?

5060
03:20:04,180 --> 03:20:04,600
Rattrap?

5061
03:20:04,660 --> 03:20:04,820
No.

5062
03:20:04,940 --> 03:20:08,220
Other than Rattrap because he has like his fucking brain exposed.

5063
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:12,640
All the other Beast Wars transformers are so fucking sick.

5064
03:20:12,940 --> 03:20:13,420
Yeah.

5065
03:20:14,560 --> 03:20:15,360
Rattrap's a...

5066
03:20:15,360 --> 03:20:18,320
Don't... Don't try to argue with me.

5067
03:20:18,380 --> 03:20:20,260
We all know Rattrap is fucking ugly.

5068
03:20:20,660 --> 03:20:21,180
Um...

5069
03:20:24,180 --> 03:20:27,360
Other than Rattrap they all look really fucking sick.

5070
03:20:27,640 --> 03:20:29,260
Um... You take that back!

5071
03:20:33,680 --> 03:20:34,880
We all know it's true.

5072
03:20:34,960 --> 03:20:36,580
Don't fucking deny it.

5073
03:20:37,500 --> 03:20:37,860
Um...

5074
03:20:38,740 --> 03:20:39,460
Let's see.

5075
03:20:41,380 --> 03:20:41,740
Um...

5076
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:43,320
Ghost Rider, thank you for the super chat.

5077
03:20:43,400 --> 03:20:44,040
Thank you, thank you.

5078
03:20:44,060 --> 03:20:46,540
Let the Doki demonetization fun begin.

5079
03:20:46,740 --> 03:20:47,920
Thank you for the super chat.

5080
03:20:48,020 --> 03:20:48,940
Thank you, thank you.

5081
03:20:49,900 --> 03:20:51,640
Um... Playmaker, thank you for the super chat.

5082
03:20:51,680 --> 03:20:52,320
Thank you, thank you.

5083
03:20:52,360 --> 03:20:53,260
Water with no soap?

5084
03:20:53,320 --> 03:20:54,920
What kind of cleaning service is this?

5085
03:20:55,020 --> 03:20:55,240
Look.

5086
03:20:55,620 --> 03:21:00,020
Look, you... They paid me five thousand dollars to clean three fucking bodies.

5087
03:21:00,180 --> 03:21:01,960
You know what you were getting at that point.

5088
03:21:02,200 --> 03:21:04,100
Five K for three bodies?

5089
03:21:04,240 --> 03:21:05,320
Like, come on.

5090
03:21:05,560 --> 03:21:08,040
Like, that is like... You're a dealer.

5091
03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:10,120
I know you make more than five thousand dollars.

5092
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:15,080
Um...

5093
03:21:15,540 --> 03:21:16,060
That's the Deadpool.

5094
03:21:16,220 --> 03:21:17,000
Thank you for the super chat.

5095
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:17,760
Thank you, thank you.

5096
03:21:17,800 --> 03:21:19,780
He was one of the kids at the Ninja DJ set.

5097
03:21:19,900 --> 03:21:23,720
He has to wear that backpack or as penance for not moving.

5098
03:21:23,980 --> 03:21:25,220
Thank you for the super chat.

5099
03:21:25,380 --> 03:21:26,720
Thank you, thank you.

5100
03:21:29,580 --> 03:21:29,940
Uh...

5101
03:21:29,940 --> 03:21:34,320
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba Uh...

5102
03:21:34,320 --> 03:21:35,940
Uh... Oh my god, we didn't get Eurobeat!

5103
03:21:36,180 --> 03:21:39,080
Someone said they wanted Eurobeat in the Akasupa.

5104
03:21:39,220 --> 03:21:39,840
Sorry, Anton.

5105
03:21:40,220 --> 03:21:41,280
Are you still here, Anton?

5106
03:21:41,700 --> 03:21:43,200
Do you want that Disney Eurobeat?

5107
03:21:43,400 --> 03:21:44,720
Okay, Eurobeat.

5108
03:21:44,820 --> 03:21:45,740
We're not cleaning anymore.

5109
03:21:46,120 --> 03:21:48,100
But let's get some movement in there.

5110
03:21:48,440 --> 03:21:51,340
Guys, this is where we're actually testing this.

5111
03:21:51,400 --> 03:21:52,320
Wait, under the sea?

5112
03:21:52,420 --> 03:21:53,480
Disney Eurobeat?

5113
03:21:53,700 --> 03:21:54,660
What does that sound like?

5114
03:21:58,030 --> 03:21:59,070
Oh my god.

5115
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:04,140
Is that even good?

5116
03:22:06,460 --> 03:22:07,420
Uh...

5117
03:22:07,420 --> 03:22:07,780
Uh...

5118
03:22:07,780 --> 03:22:14,080
It's always greener when somebody else is late.

5119
03:22:14,300 --> 03:22:17,320
Dream about going up there.

5120
03:22:17,520 --> 03:22:19,740
But that is a big mistake.

5121
03:22:20,240 --> 03:22:23,300
Look at the world behind you.

5122
03:22:23,360 --> 03:22:25,800
On the ocean floor.

5123
03:22:26,540 --> 03:22:28,720
It's Disney Eurobeat!

5124
03:22:30,700 --> 03:22:31,660
It's...

5125
03:22:31,660 --> 03:22:32,400
It's... It's... It's...

5126
03:22:32,400 --> 03:22:34,040
Under the sea.

5127
03:22:35,640 --> 03:22:37,060
Under the sea.

5128
03:22:38,540 --> 03:22:41,580
I think it's better down where it's wetter.

5129
03:22:41,580 --> 03:22:42,900
Take it from me.

5130
03:22:45,540 --> 03:22:47,160
Work all day.

5131
03:22:47,460 --> 03:22:49,820
Up in the sun they stay away.

5132
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:54,740
So don't be floating under the sea.

5133
03:22:55,580 --> 03:22:56,220
Okay.

5134
03:22:56,580 --> 03:22:58,220
Thank you for the super chat.

5135
03:22:58,320 --> 03:22:59,020
Thank you, thank you.

5136
03:22:59,540 --> 03:23:01,660
But... Wait, is Anton even here?

5137
03:23:02,180 --> 03:23:02,820
No!

5138
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:06,340
Didn't fully commit to the stream.

5139
03:23:09,700 --> 03:23:10,880
I'm joking.

5140
03:23:11,220 --> 03:23:11,920
Anton...

5141
03:23:11,920 --> 03:23:13,620
All right.

5142
03:23:13,720 --> 03:23:15,480
If anybody see Anton...

5143
03:23:15,480 --> 03:23:19,740
Anton later, tell them I played Eurobeat at the end.

5144
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:20,640
No!

5145
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:22,720
They're gone!

5146
03:23:26,280 --> 03:23:28,060
Tell them we did it.

5147
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:30,100
I did read their account!

5148
03:23:33,140 --> 03:23:34,560
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

5149
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:35,520
Thank you, thank you.

5150
03:23:35,560 --> 03:23:36,000
Thank you for the super chat.

5151
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

5152
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:38,260
Transmetal Rattrap was one of the coolest designs ever.

5153
03:23:38,360 --> 03:23:40,900
I will not stand with this slander.

5154
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:42,520
Okay, let me see what that looks like.

5155
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:43,700
What is that?

5156
03:23:43,820 --> 03:23:46,120
What does Transmetal Rattrap look like?

5157
03:23:46,320 --> 03:23:47,060
The fuck?

5158
03:23:47,820 --> 03:23:48,960
Oh, he's still ugly.

5159
03:23:53,160 --> 03:23:53,960
It's just...

5160
03:23:53,960 --> 03:23:56,540
He's just... Bro, his brain's orange.

5161
03:23:56,740 --> 03:23:57,320
Like, what?

5162
03:23:58,320 --> 03:24:01,560
A different color brain does not mean...

5163
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:02,500
Um...

5164
03:24:04,320 --> 03:24:06,100
It's not mean it's better.

5165
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:08,500
Stop being a fool.

5166
03:24:08,820 --> 03:24:09,760
But the wheels!

5167
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:11,980
His brain is orange!

5168
03:24:12,140 --> 03:24:12,980
Like, what?

5169
03:24:13,440 --> 03:24:16,320
What do you want me to say?

5170
03:24:16,540 --> 03:24:19,420
His brain is still fucking exposed and or...

5171
03:24:19,420 --> 03:24:20,280
Now it's orange!

5172
03:24:20,940 --> 03:24:23,160
Okay, but what animal almost specifically?

5173
03:24:23,420 --> 03:24:26,000
I feel like the fanartists will really appreciate it.

5174
03:24:26,040 --> 03:24:27,460
They give us super chat.

5175
03:24:27,460 --> 03:24:28,360
Thank you, thank you.

5176
03:24:28,580 --> 03:24:29,260
I don't know.

5177
03:24:29,280 --> 03:24:30,000
Surprise me.

5178
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:30,560
I don't know.

5179
03:24:30,680 --> 03:24:33,780
There's a lot of like... Other than Rattrap, a lot of designs are really cool.

5180
03:24:33,960 --> 03:24:37,560
I know like everybody was fucking in love with Arachnid.

5181
03:24:37,900 --> 03:24:38,880
Was it Arachnid?

5182
03:24:39,160 --> 03:24:39,840
Beast Wars?

5183
03:24:40,140 --> 03:24:40,640
Was that her?

5184
03:24:42,960 --> 03:24:43,360
Yeah.

5185
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:45,640
Everybody loved Arachnid.

5186
03:24:47,360 --> 03:24:48,420
Um, I don't know why.

5187
03:24:49,040 --> 03:24:50,160
Okay, we all know why.

5188
03:24:52,340 --> 03:24:53,140
Black Arachnia.

5189
03:24:53,220 --> 03:24:54,420
We all know why.

5190
03:24:56,340 --> 03:24:57,060
Oh, yeah.

5191
03:25:02,720 --> 03:25:03,360
Let's see...

5192
03:25:03,840 --> 03:25:04,340
Let's see...

5193
03:25:05,060 --> 03:25:05,380
Let's see...

5194
03:25:05,380 --> 03:25:06,920
Uh, Darkblade, they give us super chat.

5195
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:07,660
Thank you, thank you.

5196
03:25:07,700 --> 03:25:08,640
Do you think that girl is okay?

5197
03:25:08,700 --> 03:25:10,000
I think she might need a band-aid.

5198
03:25:10,060 --> 03:25:10,680
They give us super chat.

5199
03:25:10,760 --> 03:25:11,580
Thank you, thank you.

5200
03:25:12,620 --> 03:25:12,940
Uh...

5201
03:25:16,880 --> 03:25:20,360
I'm gonna read five more super chats and then I'm gonna call it here, guys.

5202
03:25:22,240 --> 03:25:23,280
And then I'm gonna call it here.

5203
03:25:24,620 --> 03:25:27,240
I'm scrolling to see... I lost count, guys.

5204
03:25:27,320 --> 03:25:29,900
I lost track of where I was in my super chats.

5205
03:25:32,340 --> 03:25:33,740
Gia, thank you for the super chat.

5206
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:34,520
Thank you, thank you.

5207
03:25:34,540 --> 03:25:37,380
If Doki gets a pet pig in the future, we know what happened.

5208
03:25:37,580 --> 03:25:37,920
What?

5209
03:25:38,300 --> 03:25:39,420
Pigs can be cute?

5210
03:25:40,740 --> 03:25:44,420
Getting a pet pig does not mean, like, a murder was committed, guys.

5211
03:25:44,680 --> 03:25:46,860
Like, it might be very poor timing, you know?

5212
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:49,260
If I get a pet pig right after...

5213
03:25:49,260 --> 03:25:51,880
right after... Oh my god, there's a Garfield Nendoroid.

5214
03:25:51,960 --> 03:25:52,300
Sorry.

5215
03:25:53,180 --> 03:25:53,980
I'm sorry.

5216
03:25:53,980 --> 03:25:55,640
I was scrolling through.

5217
03:25:55,740 --> 03:25:57,260
I can multicast, guys.

5218
03:25:57,440 --> 03:25:58,020
Oh my god.

5219
03:25:58,160 --> 03:26:08,540
Okay, if you... guys, if you're a true dragoon, you will grab a... you will grab a Garfield Nendoroid next to the Doki Bird Nendoroid, and then we can hold hands.

5220
03:26:11,580 --> 03:26:13,080
Oh my god, it's so...

5221
03:26:14,450 --> 03:26:18,010
Oh my god.

5222
03:26:18,150 --> 03:26:18,870
You know what would be cooler?

5223
03:26:19,010 --> 03:26:19,810
You swap the heads.

5224
03:26:20,030 --> 03:26:21,010
Oh my god.

5225
03:26:21,110 --> 03:26:21,930
Okay, okay.

5226
03:26:22,030 --> 03:26:23,230
I wanna be Garfield.

5227
03:26:23,230 --> 03:26:25,430
Swap my head with Garfield.

5228
03:26:28,750 --> 03:26:30,870
Um, anyway.

5229
03:26:32,270 --> 03:26:37,110
Anyway, as I was saying, as I was saying, uh, um...

5230
03:26:38,250 --> 03:26:42,850
If I have get a pet pig right after this stream, it does not mean that I committed a murder.

5231
03:26:43,070 --> 03:26:44,770
I just think pigs are really cute.

5232
03:26:44,910 --> 03:26:46,250
And if my pig seems...

5233
03:26:46,770 --> 03:26:53,210
If my pig seems really, really happy, and like, you're like, wow, Doki, where did you keep the food?

5234
03:26:53,230 --> 03:26:55,470
And I never show you guys where I keep the food.

5235
03:26:55,630 --> 03:26:59,630
It is because, like, it's just too much work to get the food, okay guys?

5236
03:26:59,910 --> 03:27:01,530
It's just way too much work.

5237
03:27:01,710 --> 03:27:07,290
Um, I have it locked up in a cupboard because I don't want him to, like... I don't want the pig to...

5238
03:27:07,290 --> 03:27:09,830
I don't want... It's as if I have a pig right now.

5239
03:27:10,790 --> 03:27:12,330
That's crazy talk.

5240
03:27:14,010 --> 03:27:15,490
That's so crazy.

5241
03:27:16,370 --> 03:27:19,050
I'm saying as if I already have the pig.

5242
03:27:19,390 --> 03:27:19,870
But...

5243
03:27:21,910 --> 03:27:22,390
Uh...

5244
03:27:23,810 --> 03:27:24,750
Um, anyway.

5245
03:27:25,470 --> 03:27:26,210
Let's see.

5246
03:27:27,870 --> 03:27:29,390
Charco, thank you for the super chat.

5247
03:27:29,470 --> 03:27:30,310
Thank you, thank you.

5248
03:27:30,330 --> 03:27:33,230
The current generation gets the bootleg version of our things.

5249
03:27:33,350 --> 03:27:34,130
Don't believe me?

5250
03:27:34,190 --> 03:27:37,770
Halo, Lord of the Rings, Call of Duty, Spongebob, Pokemon, etc.

5251
03:27:38,090 --> 03:27:38,970
Thank you for the super chat.

5252
03:27:39,050 --> 03:27:39,770
Thank you, thank you.

5253
03:27:39,810 --> 03:27:44,610
I just think it's weird that instead of making new shows, they just, um...

5254
03:27:45,570 --> 03:27:51,730
They literally just like, you know, reboot our show... the shows that we used to watch.

5255
03:27:52,030 --> 03:27:55,330
Or like, they just add more episodes to it and bring it back.

5256
03:27:55,490 --> 03:27:59,410
I just feel it's weird because some of the voice actors and actresses are super fucking old.

5257
03:27:59,530 --> 03:28:01,870
Like how people are like, bring back Gravity Falls.

5258
03:28:02,130 --> 03:28:04,990
Like, I know like a lot of people want to bring back Gravity Falls.

5259
03:28:05,490 --> 03:28:07,130
But like, oh my...

5260
03:28:07,630 --> 03:28:10,070
Like, you know what I'm really worried about?

5261
03:28:10,330 --> 03:28:16,090
So you know like, the guy that does the voice acts for it in Gravity Falls?

5262
03:28:17,330 --> 03:28:19,310
Um, you know, it's the drum...

5263
03:28:19,310 --> 03:28:20,770
Sorry, it's J.K.

5264
03:28:20,870 --> 03:28:21,150
Simmons.

5265
03:28:21,390 --> 03:28:22,530
And you know how old J.K.

5266
03:28:22,550 --> 03:28:23,210
Simmons is?

5267
03:28:23,230 --> 03:28:25,910
He's like, he's 70 years old now.

5268
03:28:26,130 --> 03:28:26,550
Like...

5269
03:28:29,350 --> 03:28:30,010
He's...

5270
03:28:30,010 --> 03:28:30,150
He's...

5271
03:28:30,150 --> 03:28:32,530
He's 70 years old now.

5272
03:28:32,710 --> 03:28:33,410
And like...

5273
03:28:34,470 --> 03:28:36,790
It's a little worrisome.

5274
03:28:38,130 --> 03:28:40,150
It just wouldn't be the same.

5275
03:28:40,250 --> 03:28:43,270
I feel like Gravity Falls ended perfectly as well.

5276
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,650
Um...

5277
03:28:45,650 --> 03:28:46,610
It ended perfectly.

5278
03:28:46,730 --> 03:28:53,730
And I don't think you should... Like, I know people are desperate because it was a really good show, but I just think that like...

5279
03:28:55,170 --> 03:28:56,630
Sorry, 69.

5280
03:28:56,850 --> 03:28:57,250
Nice.

5281
03:28:57,590 --> 03:28:58,930
I just think like...

5282
03:28:58,930 --> 03:29:03,390
I'm just worried if you bring it back, it's just not gonna be the same.

5283
03:29:03,510 --> 03:29:04,530
He's been in Omni-Man?

5284
03:29:04,650 --> 03:29:06,630
Yeah, but like, you couldn't tell he's...

5285
03:29:06,630 --> 03:29:10,030
They didn't make him do a lot of voice acting in Omni-Man.

5286
03:29:10,170 --> 03:29:19,790
You couldn't tell that the newest season, he did not voice acted as much as he did in the first season.

5287
03:29:19,930 --> 03:29:20,330
Like...

5288
03:29:20,910 --> 03:29:24,090
He did not get a lot of screen time.

5289
03:29:24,270 --> 03:29:28,030
And when he did, it felt less...

5290
03:29:28,790 --> 03:29:30,250
Less like season one.

5291
03:29:30,370 --> 03:29:30,790
I don't know.

5292
03:29:30,930 --> 03:29:32,930
That's how I felt when I watched it.

5293
03:29:34,270 --> 03:29:45,130
When I watched it, I was like... I felt like his voice acting as Omni-Man for the newest season definitely was like not as good as the first season.

5294
03:29:45,410 --> 03:29:48,770
Like it was... It just felt like a little bit like...

5295
03:29:48,770 --> 03:29:50,630
It felt... It just didn't feel the same.

5296
03:29:50,910 --> 03:29:51,170
Yeah.

5297
03:29:51,450 --> 03:29:53,030
It just didn't feel the same.

5298
03:29:54,070 --> 03:29:54,470
Um...

5299
03:29:55,470 --> 03:29:56,830
LordPancake, thank you for the super chat.

5300
03:29:56,890 --> 03:29:57,630
Thank you, thank you.

5301
03:29:57,690 --> 03:30:01,670
Honestly, the kids will be better served by just looking up the old media instead of going for the remix.

5302
03:30:01,790 --> 03:30:04,810
At this point, they have decades of good content to explore, depending on... Yeah.

5303
03:30:04,970 --> 03:30:06,410
Yeah, I agree with that too.

5304
03:30:06,510 --> 03:30:11,830
It's like how people still watch... I mean, I can understand being like Tom and Jerry gets rebooted every once in a while.

5305
03:30:11,930 --> 03:30:14,050
But also, Tom and Jerry don't fucking talk.

5306
03:30:14,330 --> 03:30:14,570
Like...

5307
03:30:14,570 --> 03:30:15,750
Oh, you can see it.

5308
03:30:15,810 --> 03:30:18,990
In some cases, Tom and Jerry do not talk at all.

5309
03:30:18,990 --> 03:30:21,110
So like it's easy to reboot them.

5310
03:30:21,210 --> 03:30:23,150
And then we have like Bugs Bunny and stuff.

5311
03:30:23,270 --> 03:30:24,950
We can get like impersonator...

5312
03:30:24,950 --> 03:30:28,330
like impressionist to do that voice acting and stuff.

5313
03:30:28,530 --> 03:30:40,070
But then it's also cause like Bugs Bunny has like a long history of like people... of people like of like a long history of impressionist and stuff.

5314
03:30:40,190 --> 03:30:56,690
But then for like some of these shows, you can't really get impressionator... impressions because like they're... they're the act... because they get like famous actors and actresses that legitimately just do their own voice.

5315
03:30:58,090 --> 03:30:58,690
Like...

5316
03:30:58,690 --> 03:31:00,170
Like what's her name?

5317
03:31:00,250 --> 03:31:01,830
Kristen Shaw for Mabel?

5318
03:31:02,270 --> 03:31:03,950
That's literally her voice.

5319
03:31:04,190 --> 03:31:07,950
Like you can't get like an impressionist for her.

5320
03:31:08,290 --> 03:31:08,890
Like...

5321
03:31:09,570 --> 03:31:10,170
Like...

5322
03:31:10,930 --> 03:31:13,930
Like a lot of the... it's just their fucking voice.

5323
03:31:14,130 --> 03:31:14,510
Like...

5324
03:31:16,790 --> 03:31:24,710
So I'm just like I don't think you can have like an actual impressionist to do Kristen Shaw's voice because it's literally just her voice when she's talking.

5325
03:31:24,970 --> 03:31:26,490
It's a really good voice.

5326
03:31:26,570 --> 03:31:27,730
It's a very unique voice.

5327
03:31:27,930 --> 03:31:28,290
But yeah.

5328
03:31:29,170 --> 03:31:29,690
Um...

5329
03:31:31,010 --> 03:31:33,930
Uh... I just think you super chat.

5330
03:31:34,030 --> 03:31:34,470
Thank you.

5331
03:31:34,490 --> 03:31:35,350
Thank you.

5332
03:31:35,890 --> 03:31:36,970
Um... Oh my god.

5333
03:31:37,010 --> 03:31:38,210
Look, my pig made a friend.

5334
03:31:39,250 --> 03:31:41,390
Um... It's just in time for Halloween.

5335
03:31:42,050 --> 03:31:42,570
Uh...

5336
03:31:42,570 --> 03:31:44,310
Sandwich, welcome to Tomato Forum.

5337
03:31:44,450 --> 03:31:44,810
Welcome.

5338
03:31:44,890 --> 03:31:45,250
Welcome.

5339
03:31:45,410 --> 03:31:47,310
Chris Pat has insane range.

5340
03:31:47,690 --> 03:31:48,790
Just look at Mari.

5341
03:31:48,990 --> 03:31:50,170
And Jack Black too.

5342
03:31:50,290 --> 03:32:01,630
I can't believe people now don't like Jack Black because it took... it took people like 30 plus years to realize Jack Black has been playing Jack Black this entire time.

5343
03:32:01,910 --> 03:32:05,890
But people didn't care because everybody thought Jack Black was just so fucking cool.

5344
03:32:06,190 --> 03:32:07,170
But then it...

5345
03:32:11,550 --> 03:32:16,230
He's literally been playing himself for like 30 plus years.

5346
03:32:16,690 --> 03:32:18,910
But nobody cared until now.

5347
03:32:18,990 --> 03:32:22,130
Because of... He did two really bad movies.

5348
03:32:22,550 --> 03:32:25,150
Two really bad movies.

5349
03:32:25,790 --> 03:32:30,990
You know, not just the Minecraft.

5350
03:32:31,270 --> 03:32:32,730
Until the...

5351
03:32:32,730 --> 03:32:34,490
It was until...

5352
03:32:34,490 --> 03:32:36,610
Until the...

5353
03:32:36,610 --> 03:32:37,990
What was it called?

5354
03:32:38,170 --> 03:32:39,010
What was it?

5355
03:32:39,190 --> 03:32:40,390
Until the...

5356
03:32:40,390 --> 03:32:42,710
Everybody forgot about that movie already.

5357
03:32:43,890 --> 03:32:44,550
Borderlands.

5358
03:32:44,870 --> 03:32:45,470
Yeah.

5359
03:32:45,570 --> 03:32:48,230
I like how everybody was like, it was until Minecraft.

5360
03:32:48,370 --> 03:32:49,150
I'm like, wow.

5361
03:32:49,370 --> 03:32:52,150
We all fucking deleted Borderlands out of our minds.

5362
03:32:52,310 --> 03:32:52,810
It's never...

5363
03:32:52,810 --> 03:32:55,670
It hasn't even been like three, two months yet.

5364
03:32:55,990 --> 03:32:57,550
And we all like...

5365
03:32:57,550 --> 03:33:01,530
We all just forgot about Borderlands.

5366
03:33:01,710 --> 03:33:03,670
And Kung Fu Panda 4 too.

5367
03:33:03,870 --> 03:33:05,930
And Kung Fu Panda 4.

5368
03:33:06,110 --> 03:33:07,990
Kung Fu Panda 4 was pretty bad.

5369
03:33:08,090 --> 03:33:08,510
Bro, he...

5370
03:33:08,510 --> 03:33:14,510
He's been playing like... He's been fucking playing Jack Black since 2000 and...

5371
03:33:14,510 --> 03:33:16,190
Since the 2000s.

5372
03:33:16,190 --> 03:33:18,630
Not even 2000s to 9.

5373
03:33:18,710 --> 03:33:20,130
He 1990s.

5374
03:33:20,130 --> 03:33:24,150
It was literally all his like really good movies are just him playing himself.

5375
03:33:30,410 --> 03:33:30,890
Um...

5376
03:33:32,470 --> 03:33:35,990
He was like the... He was like the counter Chris Pratt.

5377
03:33:36,210 --> 03:33:38,930
Like, Chris Pratt would play himself, but he's sort of like...

5378
03:33:39,830 --> 03:33:40,310
He's...

5379
03:33:40,930 --> 03:33:42,570
I don't know what the fuck happened.

5380
03:33:42,630 --> 03:33:42,750
Like...

5381
03:33:42,750 --> 03:33:44,810
Oh, he joined like...

5382
03:33:44,810 --> 03:33:49,170
I was gonna say... He became like incredibly weird.

5383
03:33:49,570 --> 03:33:50,650
I was gonna say.

5384
03:33:50,930 --> 03:33:54,150
Didn't he join... Like he joined like a specific church.

5385
03:33:54,530 --> 03:33:56,990
And then he left his wife and his kid.

5386
03:33:57,290 --> 03:33:59,690
And then people were like mad about it.

5387
03:33:59,770 --> 03:34:02,270
And that's how like everybody um...

5388
03:34:02,650 --> 03:34:05,090
Everybody got like really weird about him.

5389
03:34:06,710 --> 03:34:10,530
Um... He basically left his wife and his other child.

5390
03:34:11,330 --> 03:34:13,350
Uh... For this other wife.

5391
03:34:14,130 --> 03:34:14,770
Um...

5392
03:34:14,770 --> 03:34:16,050
For the other lady.

5393
03:34:16,910 --> 03:34:17,370
Oh, yeah.

5394
03:34:19,590 --> 03:34:20,430
I forgot.

5395
03:34:21,250 --> 03:34:22,070
That's crazy.

5396
03:34:22,170 --> 03:34:23,310
Wait, he married her?

5397
03:34:28,170 --> 03:34:29,690
Probably Scientology.

5398
03:34:29,690 --> 03:34:30,830
No, it's not Sci...

5399
03:34:30,830 --> 03:34:33,090
I don't remember if it was Sci... I don't think it's Scientology.

5400
03:34:33,330 --> 03:34:34,270
Is it Scientology?

5401
03:34:34,570 --> 03:34:36,250
I feel like we could... Oh my god.

5402
03:34:36,290 --> 03:34:36,730
I found a...

5403
03:34:36,730 --> 03:34:38,390
I saw a Scientology church.

5404
03:34:38,810 --> 03:34:40,690
I thought I saw... I found...

5405
03:34:40,690 --> 03:34:42,830
I didn't realize they exist in Canada.

5406
03:34:43,070 --> 03:34:46,030
But like... You know, I thought it was like an American thing.

5407
03:34:46,470 --> 03:34:46,890
But...

5408
03:34:49,090 --> 03:34:50,050
But like...

5409
03:34:50,050 --> 03:34:52,990
But like... Literally, when I was taking... I was... I don't know where I was going.

5410
03:34:53,210 --> 03:34:55,310
But I was taking an Uber to somewhere.

5411
03:34:55,510 --> 03:34:56,570
And I was like, what the fuck?

5412
03:34:56,590 --> 03:34:58,350
There's a Scientology church here?

5413
03:34:58,610 --> 03:35:00,590
I was like, they exist in Canada?

5414
03:35:01,350 --> 03:35:01,830
Like...

5415
03:35:03,610 --> 03:35:05,670
I was like, oh my god.

5416
03:35:06,210 --> 03:35:08,910
They fucking breached Canadian borders?

5417
03:35:09,570 --> 03:35:10,050
Like...

5418
03:35:11,990 --> 03:35:13,770
I was so surprised.

5419
03:35:13,770 --> 03:35:16,470
I was not...

5420
03:35:16,470 --> 03:35:17,370
I was not...

5421
03:35:17,370 --> 03:35:20,550
Not expecting the Scientologist to be here.

5422
03:35:21,270 --> 03:35:21,910
Anyway...

5423
03:35:24,110 --> 03:35:24,750
Um...

5424
03:35:24,750 --> 03:35:25,290
Um...

5425
03:35:25,290 --> 03:35:25,770
But yeah.

5426
03:35:25,890 --> 03:35:28,390
And then like, that's when it got really weird.

5427
03:35:28,530 --> 03:35:29,750
Because he left his...

5428
03:35:29,750 --> 03:35:30,270
Like...

5429
03:35:30,270 --> 03:35:34,370
He left his wife and son for the other lady.

5430
03:35:34,770 --> 03:35:36,630
And then things went down.

5431
03:35:36,670 --> 03:35:38,530
Because he used to be a really cool guy.

5432
03:35:39,010 --> 03:35:41,470
Like everybody liked him in the Lego movie.

5433
03:35:41,470 --> 03:35:44,010
And everybody liked him in Parks and Rec.

5434
03:35:44,310 --> 03:35:44,870
And everything.

5435
03:35:45,390 --> 03:35:49,010
And then like, for some reason he started being fucking weird.

5436
03:35:49,390 --> 03:35:50,770
Like he started...

5437
03:35:50,770 --> 03:35:53,350
He just started being really weird.

5438
03:35:53,670 --> 03:35:55,750
And people were like, what the fuck?

5439
03:35:55,930 --> 03:35:56,130
Like...

5440
03:35:57,090 --> 03:35:58,510
What the fuck happened?

5441
03:35:58,570 --> 03:35:59,590
Like he just fell off.

5442
03:36:00,350 --> 03:36:05,530
Because he was such a cool guy when he used to be in Parks... I loved him in Parks and Rec.

5443
03:36:05,850 --> 03:36:08,250
Um... That was like his big big break too.

5444
03:36:08,590 --> 03:36:11,130
And then he started being fucking weird.

5445
03:36:12,150 --> 03:36:15,610
And now Jack Black is now slowly heading there.

5446
03:36:16,750 --> 03:36:18,430
I liked how... Okay.

5447
03:36:18,570 --> 03:36:20,830
I think the funniest... Okay, not funny.

5448
03:36:21,090 --> 03:36:25,190
But everybody is saying that Kevin Hart is like a studio plant.

5449
03:36:30,410 --> 03:36:33,150
I was just like, holy fuck.

5450
03:36:33,490 --> 03:36:35,350
Like, you guys see that?

5451
03:36:35,750 --> 03:36:38,450
Everyone was like, Kevin Hart was a plant.

5452
03:36:39,370 --> 03:36:40,550
By Hollywood.

5453
03:36:41,470 --> 03:36:43,410
People fucking pushed him so hard.

5454
03:36:44,890 --> 03:36:46,710
Because of Hollywood.

5455
03:36:47,510 --> 03:36:48,190
Um...

5456
03:36:49,590 --> 03:36:50,370
Um...

5457
03:36:50,370 --> 03:36:53,430
He can't even grow above his height.

5458
03:36:53,710 --> 03:36:54,790
Do you guys see that?

5459
03:36:55,370 --> 03:36:59,330
People think he's like some studio...

5460
03:36:59,330 --> 03:37:02,790
Some Hollywood plant that was not supposed to be popular.

5461
03:37:03,170 --> 03:37:03,910
Um...

5462
03:37:05,130 --> 03:37:09,070
If he is, he didn't grow enough.

5463
03:37:09,070 --> 03:37:11,030
I was so surprised.

5464
03:37:11,190 --> 03:37:12,930
I was like, no wonder he's every...

5465
03:37:12,930 --> 03:37:13,850
Cause like, okay.

5466
03:37:13,970 --> 03:37:15,390
I can understand why.

5467
03:37:15,790 --> 03:37:22,770
Because every fucking comedy movie he's been in in the last ten years fucking sucked.

5468
03:37:22,970 --> 03:37:24,870
But they keep casting him.

5469
03:37:25,590 --> 03:37:26,450
Like, I...

5470
03:37:26,450 --> 03:37:28,010
I don't understand.

5471
03:37:28,950 --> 03:37:29,750
Like...

5472
03:37:31,190 --> 03:37:32,610
It's fucking...

5473
03:37:32,610 --> 03:37:36,330
Comedy movies are so fucking bad.

5474
03:37:37,450 --> 03:37:40,150
But he still gets casted.

5475
03:37:40,330 --> 03:37:40,890
Like...

5476
03:37:41,770 --> 03:37:42,930
It would be fun.

5477
03:37:43,130 --> 03:37:44,610
He has good voice acting.

5478
03:37:44,790 --> 03:37:48,330
I can say that his voice acting is actually really good.

5479
03:37:48,450 --> 03:37:50,490
I mean, he plays... It's literally his own voice.

5480
03:37:50,630 --> 03:37:53,250
He has a very good voice for voice acting.

5481
03:37:53,410 --> 03:37:54,550
Because it's so unique.

5482
03:37:55,250 --> 03:37:55,810
Um...

5483
03:37:55,810 --> 03:37:59,870
I liked his voice acting in Captain Underpants, the animated movie.

5484
03:38:00,290 --> 03:38:05,630
But there's been like... But his comedy... But his comedy IRL movies...

5485
03:38:06,330 --> 03:38:06,690
Sucked.

5486
03:38:06,690 --> 03:38:07,570
I didn't like it.

5487
03:38:07,690 --> 03:38:13,910
I didn't like some of the movies he... Like, I was trying to... I was trying to get... Like, check him out.

5488
03:38:13,970 --> 03:38:16,590
Like, check out his stuff in, like, movies and stuff.

5489
03:38:17,090 --> 03:38:18,230
But I just didn't.

5490
03:38:18,230 --> 03:38:21,210
To be fair, Will Ferrell's fucking movies suck too.

5491
03:38:21,350 --> 03:38:23,430
Like, for a while too, to be honest.

5492
03:38:23,890 --> 03:38:28,270
They always hit that area where it's like...

5493
03:38:30,170 --> 03:38:36,070
Where it's like... It's like a weird place where they don't even, like, have really good movies.

5494
03:38:40,110 --> 03:38:42,610
They gave them both really...

5495
03:38:42,610 --> 03:38:42,970
They gave them both really...

5496
03:38:42,970 --> 03:38:43,910
Yeah, it's like...

5497
03:38:43,910 --> 03:38:48,630
I feel like comedy movies are so hard to, like, make... make it good.

5498
03:38:48,810 --> 03:38:51,330
Because it has to have really good writing.

5499
03:38:52,230 --> 03:38:56,410
Um... It has to have really, really good, uh...

5500
03:38:56,410 --> 03:38:57,210
writing.

5501
03:38:57,850 --> 03:38:58,410
Um...

5502
03:38:58,410 --> 03:38:59,590
But, like... Oh my gosh.

5503
03:39:00,550 --> 03:39:01,710
Just... It's just...

5504
03:39:01,710 --> 03:39:02,650
I don't know.

5505
03:39:02,790 --> 03:39:05,550
I feel like the only movie I liked from Kevin Hart.

5506
03:39:06,330 --> 03:39:07,230
Was, like, Jumanji.

5507
03:39:07,730 --> 03:39:10,690
I actually... I actually low-key liked Jumanji.

5508
03:39:10,950 --> 03:39:11,210
Like...

5509
03:39:11,970 --> 03:39:15,090
The... The... The first Jumanji movie.

5510
03:39:15,470 --> 03:39:19,150
Like, it's a Jumanji movie that shouldn't have been a Jumanji movie.

5511
03:39:19,410 --> 03:39:23,430
I feel like if it wasn't... If it was its own thing...

5512
03:39:24,150 --> 03:39:34,550
If it wasn't its own thing, it... I feel like it could have succeeded without having to... Without having to... Uh...

5513
03:39:34,550 --> 03:39:35,970
What's the... What's the word called?

5514
03:39:36,330 --> 03:39:38,090
Banking off of nostalgia factor?

5515
03:39:39,310 --> 03:39:40,270
With Jumanji.

5516
03:39:41,810 --> 03:39:42,830
I enjoyed it.

5517
03:39:43,970 --> 03:39:45,490
I enjoyed Jumanji.

5518
03:39:46,590 --> 03:39:49,270
Uh... But I feel like it didn't have to be...

5519
03:39:49,270 --> 03:39:51,990
It didn't have to be called Jumanji.

5520
03:39:53,430 --> 03:39:53,910
Uh...

5521
03:39:54,930 --> 03:39:57,590
Yeah, if it didn't have that tag, nobody would watch it.

5522
03:39:57,630 --> 03:39:57,790
Yeah.

5523
03:39:57,930 --> 03:39:58,250
Yeah.

5524
03:39:58,470 --> 03:40:02,910
It just had, like, nothing related to the... I just felt like it had nothing really related to the first movie.

5525
03:40:06,830 --> 03:40:07,230
Uh...

5526
03:40:07,230 --> 03:40:07,710
Uh...

5527
03:40:08,210 --> 03:40:08,610
Alright.

5528
03:40:08,730 --> 03:40:09,130
Let's see.

5529
03:40:09,190 --> 03:40:09,830
Where was... Oh, yeah.

5530
03:40:09,850 --> 03:40:10,010
Sorry.

5531
03:40:10,050 --> 03:40:11,590
I'll do one more Super Chat, guys.

5532
03:40:11,750 --> 03:40:12,390
I know I said five.

5533
03:40:12,630 --> 03:40:13,590
I don't know how many I read.

5534
03:40:14,010 --> 03:40:16,250
But, like, uh... I know I said five.

5535
03:40:16,610 --> 03:40:17,010
So...

5536
03:40:17,010 --> 03:40:18,110
We'll just do one more.

5537
03:40:18,530 --> 03:40:19,830
There's Super Pets?

5538
03:40:19,970 --> 03:40:21,430
He was in Super Pets?

5539
03:40:21,450 --> 03:40:23,170
What the fuck is Super Pets?

5540
03:40:24,590 --> 03:40:26,410
DC League of Super Pets.

5541
03:40:26,410 --> 03:40:28,710
There was a movie about the pets of superheroes?

5542
03:40:29,070 --> 03:40:31,390
Like, why the fuck have I never heard of... Oh...

5543
03:40:32,910 --> 03:40:33,590
It must have been bad.

5544
03:40:34,550 --> 03:40:36,570
Oh, 56% on Metacrit...

5545
03:40:36,570 --> 03:40:37,670
Credit.

5546
03:40:40,600 --> 03:40:42,440
I never heard about this movie.

5547
03:40:43,080 --> 03:40:47,140
Oh, Kevin Hart was... What the fuck was Kevin Hart as?

5548
03:40:47,360 --> 03:40:47,840
Oh!

5549
03:40:47,900 --> 03:40:48,480
The Rock!

5550
03:40:48,640 --> 03:40:49,740
Okay, Rock was in here.

5551
03:40:49,880 --> 03:40:50,160
Okay.

5552
03:40:50,200 --> 03:40:51,300
No wonder they were together.

5553
03:40:52,880 --> 03:40:57,320
What the fuck was Kevin Hart as Ace?

5554
03:40:57,400 --> 03:41:00,180
He later becomes Batman's pet dog?

5555
03:41:00,720 --> 03:41:01,280
Wait!

5556
03:41:01,520 --> 03:41:04,160
Batman's pet dog isn't a fucking boxer?

5557
03:41:05,480 --> 03:41:05,920
What?

5558
03:41:06,020 --> 03:41:08,280
I thought Batman's pet dog was like...

5559
03:41:09,140 --> 03:41:10,200
He was like...

5560
03:41:10,200 --> 03:41:11,300
Wait, he was a boxer?

5561
03:41:15,380 --> 03:41:16,320
Batman's pet dog.

5562
03:41:16,540 --> 03:41:17,640
That's not a...

5563
03:41:17,640 --> 03:41:18,880
That's not a boxer?

5564
03:41:21,300 --> 03:41:22,200
No, he does.

5565
03:41:22,360 --> 03:41:24,240
What the fuck is that dog breed?

5566
03:41:25,540 --> 03:41:26,680
He says a puppy.

5567
03:41:26,860 --> 03:41:28,160
It doesn't even... Oh, he is!

5568
03:41:29,200 --> 03:41:30,480
Oh my god, I didn't realize.

5569
03:41:30,940 --> 03:41:31,960
Oh my god, it is.

5570
03:41:32,360 --> 03:41:36,120
Cause, like, what I know about, like, Batman...

5571
03:41:36,120 --> 03:41:39,580
Yeah, they all apparently have, like, pets or whatever.

5572
03:41:39,920 --> 03:41:41,080
This is what I remember.

5573
03:41:41,920 --> 03:41:43,960
Um, yeah, I thought he was like a Doberman.

5574
03:41:44,600 --> 03:41:47,880
I didn't realize, like, he was actually supposed to be a boxer.

5575
03:41:48,620 --> 03:41:50,740
Is this how I remember him?

5576
03:41:50,980 --> 03:41:51,900
How I remember...

5577
03:41:52,440 --> 03:41:54,400
Uh, sorry, let's get this Garfield out of here.

5578
03:41:54,620 --> 03:41:56,020
This is how I remember him.

5579
03:41:58,360 --> 03:42:00,660
And then I know, like, Crypto the super dog.

5580
03:42:01,460 --> 03:42:06,180
I know, like, they all have, like, pets and stuff because it's, like, marketing.

5581
03:42:06,760 --> 03:42:07,280
Uh...

5582
03:42:08,860 --> 03:42:11,620
Yeah, Wonder Woman has a kangaroo.

5583
03:42:11,860 --> 03:42:12,800
Okay, superhero.

5584
03:42:13,340 --> 03:42:14,620
I don't fucking know.

5585
03:42:14,780 --> 03:42:17,720
Oh, yeah, she, like, saved it or something.

5586
03:42:18,060 --> 03:42:22,180
So, like, they have, like, uh, they have... Who's the cow?

5587
03:42:22,380 --> 03:42:23,640
Is that Green Lantern, right?

5588
03:42:25,500 --> 03:42:27,060
Who owns the cow?

5589
03:42:27,540 --> 03:42:29,740
Who owns the fucking cow?

5590
03:42:30,660 --> 03:42:32,500
Wait, who the fuck is the cow?

5591
03:42:33,720 --> 03:42:34,240
Yeah!

5592
03:42:34,420 --> 03:42:35,980
There's a cow in here.

5593
03:42:38,660 --> 03:42:39,780
Is it Batman?

5594
03:42:40,520 --> 03:42:41,940
Oh, yeah, there's a squirrel.

5595
03:42:42,160 --> 03:42:42,320
There's...

5596
03:42:42,320 --> 03:42:43,780
Oh, Green Lantern's squirrel.

5597
03:42:44,760 --> 03:42:46,940
The Superman... Okay, I said backdrop.

5598
03:42:47,160 --> 03:42:48,260
They were joined once more.

5599
03:42:48,920 --> 03:42:50,420
Back... No, it's Batman!

5600
03:42:52,080 --> 03:42:53,820
There's a Batcow?

5601
03:42:54,820 --> 03:43:00,160
As a character created for Batcow so much they incorporated her into the new Batman...

5602
03:43:00,700 --> 03:43:04,120
Batcow became something of a meme when it was time to round up.

5603
03:43:04,220 --> 03:43:05,020
Oh, my God!

5604
03:43:05,900 --> 03:43:07,560
There's a fucking... Oh, shit!

5605
03:43:07,580 --> 03:43:09,880
Harley Quinn owns a fucking dachshund!

5606
03:43:10,080 --> 03:43:10,980
That's lucky, right?

5607
03:43:12,920 --> 03:43:15,120
What the fuck is this picture?

5608
03:43:15,780 --> 03:43:18,840
Okay, I did not realize Batcow was a thing.

5609
03:43:21,500 --> 03:43:22,240
There's this.

5610
03:43:22,440 --> 03:43:23,880
I'll show you guys Batcow.

5611
03:43:25,180 --> 03:43:27,580
There's Bat... I hope my butt doesn't get flagged.

5612
03:43:28,340 --> 03:43:29,920
That's not blood, it's Kool-Aid.

5613
03:43:30,060 --> 03:43:30,720
There we go.

5614
03:43:33,180 --> 03:43:33,700
Look,

5615
03:43:37,740 --> 03:43:38,340
see it?

5616
03:43:38,400 --> 03:43:39,440
There's a fucking...

5617
03:43:39,440 --> 03:43:40,520
It's a fucking cow!

5618
03:43:41,780 --> 03:43:43,740
Alright, guys, it's just... guys, it's not.

5619
03:43:43,800 --> 03:43:44,700
It's red paint, guys.

5620
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:48,820
Please don't flag my... Please don't flag my fucking video.

5621
03:43:51,580 --> 03:43:52,780
I didn't know that.

5622
03:43:54,160 --> 03:43:55,180
Oh, there it is.

5623
03:43:55,180 --> 03:43:56,860
There's Wonder Woman with a kangaroo.

5624
03:43:57,100 --> 03:43:58,980
Why the fuck does she have a kangaroo?

5625
03:43:59,500 --> 03:44:01,420
Technically the oldest super pet.

5626
03:44:02,140 --> 03:44:05,520
Jumpa was the high jumping kangaroo mount of young Diana.

5627
03:44:05,820 --> 03:44:07,380
Oh, she's like her horse!

5628
03:44:07,760 --> 03:44:09,000
Cause she's special!

5629
03:44:10,020 --> 03:44:13,000
There's a fucking monkey?!

5630
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:14,340
There's...

5631
03:44:14,340 --> 03:44:16,500
There's super monkey?!

5632
03:44:17,040 --> 03:44:18,740
Guys, there's fucking super monkey.

5633
03:44:19,200 --> 03:44:19,880
There's...

5634
03:44:19,880 --> 03:44:22,580
There's super monkey.

5635
03:44:23,120 --> 03:44:24,220
Oh my god!

5636
03:44:24,300 --> 03:44:27,240
Super Bones owns a fucking monkey!

5637
03:44:28,400 --> 03:44:28,840
Alright.

5638
03:44:29,220 --> 03:44:30,440
This is what it looks like.

5639
03:44:31,180 --> 03:44:31,960
Super boy.

5640
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:33,660
Look at that!

5641
03:44:34,860 --> 03:44:35,620
That's interesting.

5642
03:44:36,800 --> 03:44:37,980
That's actually really interesting.

5643
03:44:38,160 --> 03:44:39,120
Okay, I got off track.

5644
03:44:39,280 --> 03:44:40,200
Alright, guys, we're gonna call it here.

5645
03:44:40,380 --> 03:44:41,620
It was nice to just chat again.

5646
03:44:41,920 --> 03:44:42,640
Hey, everybody!

5647
03:44:42,980 --> 03:44:44,080
I'm gonna call it here.

5648
03:44:44,700 --> 03:44:47,900
I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me today.

5649
03:44:48,100 --> 03:44:53,060
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5650
03:44:53,200 --> 03:44:56,820
And if you stood up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

5651
03:44:56,880 --> 03:44:58,100
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5652
03:44:58,680 --> 03:44:59,520
Bye, guys!

5653
03:45:00,080 --> 03:45:00,500
Bye!
