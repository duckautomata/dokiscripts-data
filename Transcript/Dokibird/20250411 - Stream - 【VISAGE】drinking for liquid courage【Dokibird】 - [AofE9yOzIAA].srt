1
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,960
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,560
Sorry, I was trying to find my scene.

3
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
Wait, what's happening?

4
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,300
Oh, sorry, we're live.

5
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,980
I didn't give you the countdown like I usually do.

6
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,340
You were just talking about your pizza.

7
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,720
I was like, oh yeah, sorry, let me find my scene.

8
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,400
I was like, hello!

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,340
I stopped mid-conversation to swap my scene.

10
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,080
Wait, why are my ears messed up on your screen?

11
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,760
What?

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,980
Is it?

13
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,480
Was it not supposed to look like that?

14
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,180
No!

15
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,820
Hold on, I'll show you how they look on mine.

16
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
Maybe I won't match you then.

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,480
Wait, that's not fair.

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,980
I don't want to mess up with my cat ears.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm still a kitty.

20
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,400
Still a kitty and...

21
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,940
Mid-kitty.

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,040
I was going to say, kint.

23
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,620
No, that's gross!

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,680
Mine's a little low.

25
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,860
Don't worry, I'll turn her up.

26
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,260
Oh yeah, you were at like 200.

27
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,380
Wait, what the heck?

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay, why is your...

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,940
I don't know!

30
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,460
Turn it off.

31
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,140
Take it off.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Take what off?

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,740
The white thing off.

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,140
The ghost thing.

35
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't.

36
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,040
That's my ghost thing.

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,200
It's okay.

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,240
It already looks like that.

39
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,120
What?

40
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,640
Okay, wait.

41
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah?

42
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,380
Oh, no.

43
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,720
I don't have automatic gain control on.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,440
I don't know.

45
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:27,940
Wait.

46
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,900
Maybe I shouldn't have it on.

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,040
Wait.

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,460
Hello?

49
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,100
Hello?

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,460
Okay, I'm going to turn this off so I can like...

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,820
See, I can take your ghost thingy off on my end.

52
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,760
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,080
Oh, I can take it off.

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,880
Oh, now I'm loud.

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,060
Oh, now I took it off.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,380
Okay.

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,060
Wait, why do you have that on?

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,640
How do you...

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,660
Why do you have that little hat on?

60
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,920
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,580
The little hat.

62
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,900
Are you already drunk?

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,980
No, I'm not.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
I will be very soon.

65
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,720
No, like your little hat.

66
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,540
I don't have a hat.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,900
Yeah, you have the hat.

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,360
Like, on my screen.

69
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,460
Yeah, I don't want that.

70
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,720
Well, no, I have to have that.

71
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't.

72
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,600
Take it off.

73
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,780
Just pretend.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
Like, just take it off.

75
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,660
Like, and then it will register.

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,880
Hold on.

77
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,420
I'm going to redo my ears.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,360
But on your screen.

79
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,660
Wait, did they disappear?

80
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,820
Okay, yeah.

81
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,340
Yeah, they got it.

82
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,420
Cat ear.

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,320
Just take it.

84
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,620
No, it's the hat thing you're wearing.

85
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,660
My hat?

86
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,160
That's not a hat.

87
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,380
What is that?

88
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Wait, what is that?

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,760
Is that not a hat?

90
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,760
It's like a little cloth.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,260
Yeah, it's a hat.

92
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,600
I use it in case I forget, like, underwear or something.

93
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,040
No, it's still there.

94
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,240
The hat's still there.

95
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,360
Okay.

96
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,040
Wait, oh my gosh, it's behind me.

97
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
This sucks.

98
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,440
It's like surgically implanted on your head.

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,720
Wait, no, put it in front.

100
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,200
I am on my screen.

101
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:16,900
Just force it.

102
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,080
Until it's, like, in the front.

103
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,180
Hold on, I'm going to try again.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,720
Force it.

105
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,000
Just force it there.

106
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Yeah, just force it.

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,660
Hold on.

108
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,800
Wait, maybe I can do this.

109
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,220
Okay.

110
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,780
Okay.

111
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,800
Get Celia here and, like, have...

112
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Just remove...

113
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,520
I know, Celia!

114
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,340
Celia, can you remove the hat for me?

115
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,780
Oh, I got it to work!

116
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,140
Yay!

117
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,960
Okay, I have one ear.

118
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,100
Celia, we need you to do a quick, like, ten minute change for us.

119
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,140
It's my ghost thing.

120
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,420
What?

121
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,960
Okay, I'm watching.

122
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,860
Why don't we just take up the majority of the screen?

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,780
There we go.

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
This is the... this is massage now.

125
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,100
This is...

126
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,900
No, I'm self-conscious.

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,980
Don't take up the screen while I'm fixing my ear.

128
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,580
Alright.

129
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,300
Okay, so one minute I was talking about...

130
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,240
We were talking about a lot of stuff.

131
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,660
But one of the things we were talking about while I was setting up...

132
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,700
Sorry for being late, but...

133
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,820
You're not sorry.

134
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,300
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,780
Like, dragoons and the wisps gave up their time to watch you babysit me.

136
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,780
Apparently, I'm peaking, by the way.

137
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,420
Oh, you're peaking?

138
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,080
Okay, I'll turn you...

139
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,260
I'll turn you down a little bit.

140
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,220
Okay, say something.

141
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,400
Is it better now, guys?

142
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,020
I don't know.

143
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,220
I think I fixed my audio, so...

144
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,060
Okay, so basically, what we're...

145
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,120
One of the things, we were talking about cold pizza.

146
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,300
Because...

147
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,260
You know, I got my...

148
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,060
It just hits different.

149
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,160
I just got my alcohol, and I was like, okay, I should...

150
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,820
I should eat...

151
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,220
Like, put something in my stomach right now.

152
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,560
Because you don't want to drink on an empty stomach, or it's going to hit harder.

153
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,020
Anyway, so...

154
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,920
Obviously, I had the cold pizza, because I got depressed over Marvel Rivals.

155
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,100
Well...

156
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,840
Oh, sad.

157
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
It's such a sad story.

158
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,960
I was telling Min about how sad it was.

159
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,280
And I was like, because I hate myself, let me eat my...

160
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,480
The pizza I ordered last night for my depression grind.

161
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,540
Yeah.

162
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,160
And then, apparently, like...

163
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,720
Min was like, oh, I love cold pizza.

164
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,820
It just hits different.

165
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,320
But like, I was just like...

166
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,440
It hits different.

167
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,000
I was like, yeah, but like...

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,520
Hot pizza is just objectively better.

169
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
It's just...

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,580
It's just better than cold pizza, because like, you know...

171
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,260
Cold pizza is literally a depression meal, and that's what I have right now.

172
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,220
Because I...

173
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,800
Not only did I have...

174
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,560
Did I not get top 500...

175
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,300
Okay, your chat is saying cold pizza good.

176
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,020
It do hit different.

177
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,220
Okay, okay.

178
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,820
People who say it do hit different.

179
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,540
Are you American?

180
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,720
Also, are you...

181
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,360
Are you Asian or not?

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,040
Are you Asian?

183
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,420
It does hit different, though.

184
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,580
Yes, I'm American.

185
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,620
I like hot food.

186
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,520
Cold pizza is better.

187
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,800
No, it's not.

188
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,920
Like, you get the cheese pull...

189
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm reading your chat.

190
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,620
If you warm it up, you get the cheese pull.

191
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,540
And then, like, it's extra cheesy and stuff.

192
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,380
But it's a different experience.

193
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,920
It's just like...

194
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,640
You had a really rough day.

195
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,920
And you're just...

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,400
Nothing in life matters anymore.

197
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,340
Not even...

198
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,900
So, why should I waste my time warming up food?

199
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,740
It's just...

200
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,760
It's just more sad.

201
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,040
You just don't understand...

202
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,920
You just don't get it.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,700
You just...

204
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,080
No, I get the depression meal.

205
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,640
Because that's what...

206
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,100
That's why I literally just had cold pizza.

207
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,640
No, I get it.

208
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,380
Not only did I...

209
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,680
Did I not climb in Marble Rivals Rank...

210
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,020
After the last 2-3 days of playing that fucking game.

211
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,380
But also...

212
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
What did you end at?

213
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,060
I went down.

214
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,620
I went down.

215
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,380
And then...

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,740
Okay, so I had, like, 4 hours of sleep, by the way.

217
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,140
Because I was like...

218
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,820
Okay, I either play for 4-5 hours...

219
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,940
See if I could make it.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,960
And then...

221
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,260
And if I don't make it, I might have to try and play more while drunk.

222
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,580
And then I was like...

223
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,460
I shouldn't.

224
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,580
While drunk?

225
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,800
You think that you would do better?

226
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,600
No.

227
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,220
That's why I was like...

228
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,220
I am not sobering up enough to, like...

229
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,820
Because, like, it ends at midnight.

230
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,160
Like, the time.

231
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,400
It ends at exactly midnight.

232
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,220
And I was like...

233
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,920
There is no way I'm gonna be...

234
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,360
Sober up...

235
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,660
She wanted to play a horror game instead.

236
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,380
She wanted to be like...

237
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,720
And...

238
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,120
No, the thing is...

239
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,720
I was like...

240
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,780
Either today, I'm drinking to celebrate...

241
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,080
Or I'm drinking...

242
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,800
Or I'm drinking because something bad happened.

243
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,180
Yeah.

244
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,460
Now...

245
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,540
Drink the depression and pain away.

246
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,320
You'll have a massage to...

247
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,560
No, the massage will make you forget all about it.

248
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,040
It will scare away your worries.

249
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:58,720
Exactly.

250
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,280
It will scare it away.

251
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,260
Yeah.

252
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,580
Yeah, see, it works now.

253
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,740
Yeah.

254
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm gonna have Kat here's next outfit.

255
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,540
Oh, really?

256
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,700
Leaks?

257
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:15,980
Leaks?

258
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,400
Do you wanna see?

259
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,640
Yeah, oh my gosh, yeah.

260
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,100
I'm gonna see it.

261
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,660
You won't, guys.

262
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah, you won't, guys.

263
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,380
Alright.

264
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,260
I'll show you my new outfit.

265
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,340
I don't know if I showed you.

266
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,740
Oh, I wanna see.

267
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,760
Alright, yeah, yeah.

268
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,800
Let me show you.

269
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Okay, we'll send.

270
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,560
Don't worry, you'll hear our reactions to each other's new outfits.

271
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,320
Yeah.

272
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,420
Yeah, that's just as good, right, guys?

273
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm sending this to the right person, right?

274
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,660
Okay, okay, okay.

275
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay, let me see.

276
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,220
Alright.

277
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,920
Oh my god!

278
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,340
You are so playing it up.

279
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,080
No, it's because of the second one.

280
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

281
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,400
Oh my god!

282
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,720
I can see a lot of fanart because of that one thing over...

283
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,060
Right!

284
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,580
This is not fair.

285
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,680
Life's not fair.

286
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:27,960
Wait, what's yours?

287
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,120
I didn't get top 500.

288
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,900
Life's not fucking fair.

289
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,700
Why is everyone spamming that, like, ugly angry?

290
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Now you know how I felt.

291
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,260
You know how many hours I played Rivals in the last three days?

292
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,220
I've invested at least ten hours a day the last three...

293
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,840
Life's not fucking fair.

294
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,700
So let me have this.

295
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,400
Wait, send me yours.

296
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

297
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,220
Oh my god, I love the hair.

298
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,240
Extra freaky.

299
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,820
You heard it here first, folks.

300
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,240
Extra freaky.

301
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,760
She has, like, the cycle of abuse continues.

302
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,160
That's right!

303
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,560
Okay, I can say something really fucked up.

304
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,700
I had a bad day at work and I'm the dad that came back drinking.

305
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,840
Wait, what?

306
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,480
I came back.

307
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,780
I'm the father figure right now.

308
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,980
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,500
Aw, man.

311
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,360
Okay, I'm trying to find the PNGs right now.

312
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,580
You know how, like, I download everything in the downloads folder?

313
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,340
Oh, me too.

314
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,940
Yeah, I'm like, there's so many images of other stuff.

315
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,220
I only had this so easily because I got it today.

316
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,600
Oh, shit!

317
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,920
Oh my god, okay, let me... I'll show you two outfits.

318
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,320
They know there's two outfits coming in.

319
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,760
They know.

320
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,740
Okay, so...

321
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:10,740
What?

322
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,380
Mom, did you have two outfits?

323
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,180
Yeah.

324
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:14,860
Alright.

325
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,460
And then...

326
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,580
Oh my god!

327
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
And then...

328
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,240
Wait, that's so cute!

329
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,340
Wait,

330
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,820
I have another version of that, though, that's even sillier.

331
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,860
Oh, I like it.

332
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,460
Okay, but, like...

333
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,480
Let's see, where's the other one?

334
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm trying to find the other one.

335
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah, react to what you like about it, but, like, vaguely.

336
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,660
We're matching again.

337
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,860
Look at the hair, we're matching again.

338
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,900
Oh, wait, really?

339
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,380
That's funny.

340
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,540
Guys, it was... Like, it's really unintentional, guys.

341
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,000
It's so unintentional.

342
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,480
We literally just saw this today.

343
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,620
It's so funny.

344
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,740
Oh my god.

345
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,320
Here's the other one that's coming out first, though.

346
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,140
Here's the other one.

347
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,240
Oh, coming out first, okay.

348
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

349
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,780
Oh my god.

350
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,480
What are those?

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,040
Oh yeah, there's physics on that.

352
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,680
Wait, wait, I'll show you what...

353
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,360
I'll show you what Celia sent me.

354
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,420
It's like...

355
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,040
It's kind of disgusting.

356
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,720
Okay, but, like, it's actually so fucking funny.

357
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,800
They're all angry.

358
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,420
It's like, that's not fair!

359
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,340
Wait, this is... You said you were the dad.

360
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,960
This is, like, the most dad.

361
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,840
The most dad.

362
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,360
I hate that.

363
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,660
I hate that.

364
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,760
What do you mean, ew?

365
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,960
What do you mean, not ew?

366
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,800
What?

367
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,480
It's so cute.

368
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,420
It's like a cow udder.

369
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,980
Also, like, that...

370
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,360
The first one I sent you, it actually has, like, an alternate...

371
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,300
An alternate outfit to it.

372
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,340
Wait, let me see if I can find...

373
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,320
I don't know if I...

374
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,280
Let me see if I can find it.

375
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,300
I know I sent her, like...

376
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,040
Oh, here.

377
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,240
Here's the udder...

378
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,740
The udder outfit.

379
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh my god, udder.

380
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,060
The udder outfit.

381
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,320
That's literally what you can call this one.

382
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,420
You guys...

383
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,980
You guys will understand.

384
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,240
Look at the...

385
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, cute!

386
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,820
Look at the jacket.

387
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,800
Yeah, I like...

388
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
I like the one you went with, though.

389
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,600
Yeah.

390
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,920
The main one.

391
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,840
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,920
Oh, you're getting both?

393
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,840
I'm getting both so it can swap between the two.

395
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,040
Like, how I feel that day.

396
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,640
That's cute.

397
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,840
Yeah.

398
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,820
Okay, guys.

399
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,260
If you can't show it, sorry.

400
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,020
Sorry, guys.

401
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,720
Sorry.

402
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,600
Sorry, we can't show it to you.

403
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh, you know we really want to, though, Wisps and Dragoons.

404
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,900
You know that.

405
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,680
Yeah.

406
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,060
We really, really want to.

407
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:42,980
But, like...

408
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,200
Yeah, but we just, you know...

409
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,620
You know...

410
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,580
It's gotta be complete.

411
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,180
We'll show you when it's at its ultimate best form.

412
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,680
Yeah, and like, you know, it's to build up hype.

413
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,260
Now you're so excited now, right?

414
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,960
To see what you can possibly...

415
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,160
You're like, what's this disgusting udder?

416
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,560
What is that freaky hairstyle she's talking about?

417
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,160
What could make it so freaky?

418
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,280
Oh, man.

419
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,620
I'm not looking forward to playing this game.

420
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,560
Wait, have you ever played?

421
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,220
You chose this.

422
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,100
I've never played this.

423
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,120
You've never played Visage?

424
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,200
Never?

425
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,820
Like, you heard about it, though, right?

426
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,060
Yeah, yeah.

427
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,600
Okay.

428
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,120
I've never played it.

429
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,040
Yeah, everyone knows it's apparently the scariest game anyone's ever played.

430
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,840
Yeah, but you played P.T., though.

431
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,440
You played P.T.

432
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,400
I know, I was gonna say.

433
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,500
Yeah, like, this game was inspired by P.T., that's the thing.

434
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,060
They have a section in there that has actual, like...

435
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,740
What was it called?

436
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,160
Like, tribute or Easter egg to it.

437
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
That's inspired by P.T.

438
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,420
And, like, what it could have been and stuff like that.

439
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,780
So there's, like, bits and pieces of it.

440
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,120
Like, a whole homage to it.

441
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah.

442
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,900
But it's, like, one of the chapters.

443
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,160
And we're not doing that chapter.

444
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,320
Oh, what?

445
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,940
How far do you wanna get today?

446
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,160
I don't ask.

447
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,060
I don't know.

448
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,960
Honestly, wherever this bottle's gonna take me.

449
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,500
You could get through the whole thing if the bottle helped.

450
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,340
No.

451
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,720
No.

452
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,700
It is a long game, man.

453
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,460
Someone said, charity goal says all chapters.

454
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,380
Did it actually say all chapters?

455
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,420
Oh, my God.

456
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,100
I don't even remember what I wrote.

457
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,160
It's been a year.

458
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,260
Yes, it did.

459
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,600
You said all chapters.

460
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,740
Yeah, all chapters.

461
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,060
Who's a charity right now?

462
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,620
I am.

463
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,100
You're my charity case, cuz I'm here.

464
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,840
We're not gonna make any progress today.

465
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,000
Even your mod said, yes, it's all chapters.

466
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Alright, let's do this.

467
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,980
It's like a year-long event.

468
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,040
For charity!

469
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,920
Every couple months, I hit you up and it's like, alright, you wanna do part two?

470
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,400
Every part, it's gonna be, like, two to three months later.

471
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,420
I was like, alright, I'm ready for part two.

472
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
And I hit you up in, like, June or some shit.

473
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,140
Sorry, I can't do that.

474
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,680
You'll just have to play by yourself, Doki.

475
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,100
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

476
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,880
I'm busy that day.

477
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,740
On the exact all days of June.

478
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,900
Yeah, actually.

479
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,000
What about July then, huh?

480
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,520
Let's just schedule it in advance right now for part two.

481
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,040
Next week.

482
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,480
Okay, wouldn't it be better to just get through it?

483
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,860
So if you space it out...

484
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,700
Yeah, but then I'll forget about what happened last time.

485
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,020
And then you're like, oh wait, you're right.

486
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,560
You'll grow a mute to it.

487
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,760
I'll grow, like, accustomed to the game.

488
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,020
Scared every time.

489
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,760
Just re-engaging with it.

490
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,480
Alright, I guess we'll do next week.

491
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,700
Oh, I'm busy next week?

492
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,720
Oh, yeah, okay, how about in two weeks then?

493
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,040
Okay.

494
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,040
Oh, is that easy?

495
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,180
Guys, she's easy.

496
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,360
What?

497
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,720
Okay, no, I'm busy the rest of the year.

498
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,340
Okay, 2026.

499
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,900
The anniversary.

500
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,580
You play it once a year.

501
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,200
What if I just play it once a year?

502
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,720
Every anniversary, we go do another part of Massage.

503
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
I feel like we'd actually do that, though.

504
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Just to fuck with them.

505
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,640
Just to be like...

506
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,200
Happy anniversary, guys.

507
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,880
Massage Part 2.

508
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,860
Part 2!

509
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,440
You wanna start up the game now?

510
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,960
Alright, let me...

511
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,840
Guys, I actually downloaded a game, like, the day I joined the call.

512
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,980
Like, today.

513
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,880
Oh, yeah, she called me and was like, I'm installing the game right now.

514
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,940
Yeah, I was like, sorry, if I'm, like, buffering right now, I'm actually installing the game.

515
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,420
I don't know if we're big enough.

516
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,220
Are we big enough on this?

517
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,520
I feel like if I say that, they're like, no, we want you bigger.

518
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,940
I'll pick it a little bigger.

519
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,980
No, I think that's good.

520
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,780
Yeah.

521
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,840
Okay, let me... I'll make it a little tiny bit bigger.

522
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,600
There you go.

523
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,460
There you go.

524
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,560
You're so tiny.

525
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,200
Look how short you are.

526
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,360
You literally are, like, not even that taller than me.

527
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,820
That is not true.

528
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,820
That is true!

529
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,980
That is not true.

530
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,000
I look down.

531
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,680
I remember looking down.

532
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,520
You are, like, what?

533
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,840
152?

534
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,200
That's, like, two centimeters taller than me.

535
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,800
Oh, yeah, no, guys, no, she's lying.

536
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,740
Why would I lie?

537
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,580
Is that including your cat ears as well?

538
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,260
Are you including... are you including your little... what is it called?

539
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,480
The... I'm scared of pronouncing it.

540
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:03,900
Oh, yeah.

541
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,740
I'm scared of pronouncing it wrong because I always pronounce it the other... the other one.

542
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,260
Say it.

543
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,400
Say the other one.

544
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:10,820
No, no, no, no, no.

545
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,560
Say it.

546
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,020
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

547
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,220
Say it.

548
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,860
Alright.

549
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,720
Okay, I'm... I'm not ready.

550
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,100
I'm not actually ready, but I'm ready.

551
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,640
You are.

552
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,480
Okay.

553
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,560
Alright.

554
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,940
So, I told Mint that I tried to play this last time a couple of years ago.

555
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,860
And it didn't... I don't even know if it's... if it has my old save file.

556
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,540
But I tried to play this a couple of years ago, also drunk, by the way.

557
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,940
And I told you guys that, too.

558
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,880
Where I played... and then, like, I only got to the level select.

559
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,240
Because, like, I was... it was just so fucking scary that I could never make it past the level select.

560
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,160
Wait, so you never actually started the game?

561
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,800
No, and then I watched someone else play one of the chapters.

562
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:03,980
And then... and then I, like, YouTubed, like, a no commentary playthrough of one of the chapters.

563
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,020
And we just pretend I played it while I was drunk.

564
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,660
I was roleplaying.

565
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,800
You just pretended to play.

566
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,800
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,760
I was like, woah, guys.

568
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,460
Well, luckily, this time is for charity, so you can't do that.

569
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,100
Alright, let me...

571
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,940
Okay, let me boot up.

572
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,280
Alright.

573
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,900
Visage.

574
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,480
Also, how's Mint's...

575
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,480
oh.

576
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,440
Yeah, I was gonna say you.

577
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,720
Tiny... okay.

578
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,320
Teensy tiny bit.

579
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,700
Okay.

580
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,680
Teensy tiny.

581
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,420
Are you gonna screen share the game to me?

582
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Yeah.

583
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,060
No, I'm just like, you're just listening to the...

584
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,520
I watch through the YouTube.

585
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,900
Yeah, you're just gonna watch through the YouTube stream so it's always, like, delayed.

586
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,500
Okay.

587
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,340
Yeah, I got the stream.

588
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,140
Alright.

589
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,320
Oh, look, it's you, Doki Bird!

590
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,740
Oh my god, that's me.

591
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,740
Someone please free me.

592
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,180
It's you!

593
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,240
Let's see.

594
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,720
Let's look at the audio.

595
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,140
Okay, so, like, I learned this from the first time I played it.

596
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:18,520
And there's no, like, when you pause the game, it's like, you have to press an extra button to pause the game.

597
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,740
It's that fucked up.

598
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:19,920
What?

599
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,960
It's not like...

600
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Yeah, so, like, when it's paused, it's not actually paused.

601
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,800
Oh, okay.

602
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,360
So, like, okay, we're doing new game.

603
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,500
Alright, Visage is hard.

604
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,140
Oh, yeah, there's a lot of puzzles too, so that's what you're gonna be helping me with that.

605
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,080
That's what I'm here for.

606
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,940
That's the, yeah, you're the puzzle master.

607
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,060
Visage.

608
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,820
Oh, it looks like Silent Hill The Room.

609
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,540
Oh, I think I upped the brightness all the way up too from the first time.

610
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,080
It looks really... yeah, that's like...

611
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,380
Yeah, I was like...

612
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,440
I'm pretty sure I upped the brightness all the way up from the first time.

613
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:55,980
Okay.

614
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,320
Whoa, yeah, there's, like, there's a chapter where there's, like, a baby crying and shit like that.

615
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,880
Oh, it's so PT.

616
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,240
Yeah, but, yeah, I remember it, and that's the chapter we're not doing today.

617
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,660
Okay.

618
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,600
Wait, how do you know all the chapters then if you've never played it?

619
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,880
Oh, no, I read, like, it's the scare, it's the one that's, like, the PT inspired one.

620
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,040
Oh.

621
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,020
Yeah, so I know about...

622
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,940
A muffled cry is you.

623
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,100
Wait, they have no game audio.

624
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,960
No, there is, it's just really quiet.

625
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,140
There's, like...

626
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,340
Oh, okay.

627
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,700
Yeah.

628
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,180
Wait, actually, I'll turn it up just in case.

629
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,720
It's just really quiet because nothing's actually happening.

630
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,060
Yeah, and all you hear is the bullets.

631
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,700
Yeah.

632
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,210
Oh.

633
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,670
I don't really remember the beginning.

634
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,430
I guess he's gonna kill his family.

635
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,690
Oh, probably.

636
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:53,530
Yeah.

637
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,050
Oh.

638
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,010
Oh, God.

639
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,030
Oh, my God.

640
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,730
Do you think she's okay?

641
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,470
Her dogs are out.

642
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,470
Maybe it's just roleplay.

643
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,390
Yeah.

644
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,030
Yeah.

645
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,390
Totally.

646
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,670
Yeah, it's just roleplay.

647
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,550
This whole game is just a whole, like, home invasion roleplay.

648
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,590
Like BDSM roleplay.

649
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,310
POV.

650
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,150
Some couples are into that, everybody.

651
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,810
Yeah, like the freaky shit.

652
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,470
It's like, remember...

653
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,630
The key's under the doormat, honey.

654
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,590
Oh, there's the whole family.

655
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,190
Wait, you shouldn't get the kids involved.

656
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,970
Yeah, they should stay in the bedroom, guys.

657
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,310
Yeah.

658
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,070
It is a freaky couple.

659
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,970
Oh!

660
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,330
Oh!

661
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,210
Oh.

662
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:49,770
Oh.

663
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,630
Why is, like, the blood out of focus?

664
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,110
Yeah.

665
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,090
Like, it's in focus.

666
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,890
The blood is the one that's in focus right now.

667
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,370
Oh, no, that's the child.

668
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,790
Oh, my God!

669
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,630
Oh.

670
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,850
Guys, it's okay.

671
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,730
It's part of the roleplay.

672
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,550
They have blood bags.

673
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,250
They have blood bags and everything, guys.

674
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,350
It's like a ketchup bag.

675
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,150
Oh, goodbye.

676
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,590
Oh, goodbye.

677
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,890
That was a child.

678
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:18,750
Jesus.

679
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,150
Boss, you just killed a child.

680
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,470
That's why you're the best.

681
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,310
It's like a Metal Gear meme.

682
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,370
Yeah.

683
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,810
Boss, you just killed a child.

684
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,170
Amazing work.

685
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,430
That's why you're the best.

686
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,490
A real soldier right there.

687
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,450
Alright.

688
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,270
I'm walking out.

689
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,530
Ew.

690
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,830
You're hobbling out.

691
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,610
You're not walking.

692
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,010
Oh, welcome to PT.

693
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,530
Yippee.

694
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,570
Okay, so, when I first played this game...

695
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,250
I didn't realize, when you're there, it's the level select.

696
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,690
So, I was stuck there for, like, an hour.

697
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,230
Because I did not know where to go.

698
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,250
And I was so fucking scared.

699
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,270
Oh, yeah.

700
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,070
Gamma...

701
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,190
Wait.

702
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,570
That's not normal, right?

703
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,350
The bottom side is supposed to be invisible.

704
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,510
I was like...

705
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:14,770
Oh, yeah.

706
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,310
That's definitely, like, past Derky's save file right there.

707
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,630
128720.

708
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,270
Oh, your texture qualities are low.

709
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,410
Change everything to high.

710
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,670
It's because if I can't see what's going on...

711
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,350
If I...

712
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,770
If I don't know what's going...

713
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,930
This is 2025, Doki.

714
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,470
This is...

715
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,550
For charity.

716
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,270
If I can't see the ghost, then everything will be fine.

717
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,550
Turn down the gamma.

718
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,050
The pixels will become less scary.

719
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,750
I thought they looked really ugly.

720
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,610
I was like, this is...

721
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,650
Wow, it's really old.

722
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,610
It looks so terrible.

723
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,990
Wait, is the resolution scale supposed to be high as well?

724
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,290
I don't know what the resolution scale is.

725
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:06,610
I don't know, actually.

726
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,670
Turn it down for charity.

727
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,810
Turn it down for charity.

728
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,490
Oh my god, it's scary.

729
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,810
Look how scary it is.

730
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,410
Like, I can see...

731
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,770
I can see everything when the camera's up.

732
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,850
And then I can't see anything now.

733
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,450
Look at that.

734
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,070
Look how dark it is.

735
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,250
It is pretty dark.

736
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:26,490
Yeah.

737
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,510
I would put it halfway.

738
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,350
Put it halfway between the middle and...

739
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,990
Okay, here.

740
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,430
Yeah, like that.

741
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:31,630
Yeah, yeah.

742
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,150
And now I can vaguely see what's going on there.

743
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:34,970
Okay.

744
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,490
Yeah.

745
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,650
So you can see that it's still playing.

746
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,650
You can see the light is still going on and off.

747
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,410
So you're in this part of the setting.

748
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:42,970
It's not even...

749
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,610
You have to pause the game.

750
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,630
You have to go to...

751
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,770
Wait, where do you have to go?

752
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,110
Oh, you have to go pause game.

753
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:49,770
What?

754
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,150
What?

755
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,130
You have to click this to pause the game.

756
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,910
The game will pause?

757
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,270
Yeah.

758
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,550
Oh my god.

759
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,230
That's so messed up.

760
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:57,650
Yeah.

761
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,610
So you're just like...

762
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,090
You know, if a ghost comes out, you're like...

763
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,490
You have to press this too.

764
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,690
And then it gives a countdown.

765
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,190
So what if a ghost is on your ass?

766
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,070
It gets you.

767
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,150
I'm gonna get you.

768
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,550
It has a delay.

769
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,570
That's messed up.

770
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,490
Alright, let me turn this down too.

771
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,390
Alright.

772
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:16,790
Alright.

773
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,790
Okay, so I was stuck here for...

774
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,190
Oh, wait.

775
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,790
What's this?

776
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,430
I gotta go to the bathroom real quick.

777
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:22,810
I'll be right back.

778
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,250
Wait, what?

779
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,550
Alright, guys.

780
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,230
I'm gonna wait here real quick.

781
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,290
Oh, progress.

782
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:29,850
Oh my god.

783
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,010
I literally just got goosebumps just by looking at the progress room.

784
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,290
Mint's mic is peaking.

785
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,330
Don't wait for me.

786
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:40,990
Don't wait for me.

787
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:41,750
Don't wait for me.

788
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,070
Okay, your mic is peaking sometimes, by the way.

789
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,150
You might have to adjust it.

790
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,310
Like, turn it down a little.

791
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,030
Okay, she didn't hear.

792
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,390
The hub contains items that represent your progress throughout the game.

793
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,990
These items are collected in different ways, including the end of a chapter.

794
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,610
Once collected, the items will automatically appear in the progress room.

795
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:00,950
Okay.

796
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:02,950
Alright.

797
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,370
Can I open this?

798
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,910
Is there anything there?

799
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,290
Oh.

800
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,370
Oh, is this a confessional?

801
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,470
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

802
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,290
Okay, now I don't like that.

803
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,950
Okay, let me up my sensitivity a little bit more.

804
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,330
I don't like this.

805
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,250
What do you mean a wink?

806
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,670
Mint, they just literally said you winked at the chat.

807
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,830
I know you're there, right?

808
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,590
Oh.

809
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,790
Okay.

810
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,670
Hello?

811
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,650
Hello, hello?

812
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,570
Oh, I have a neighbor?

813
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,280
Oh, game volume's low?

814
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,180
Okay, don't worry.

815
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,700
I'll fix that.

816
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,300
Whoa.

817
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
Sorry to blow my nose.

818
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,780
Don't want to mute myself right now.

819
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,080
I'm at that point of stage in my life where I don't care anymore.

820
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,220
Alright.

821
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,900
Hey, welcome back.

822
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,220
Goddammit, how did you know?

823
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,020
Welcome back.

824
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,980
Oh my god, you just started moving and everything.

825
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,660
Okay, so I didn't realize...

826
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,240
I thought you were paying attention to the game, you know?

827
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,120
I have OBS on my second monitor.

828
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,180
Like, I can see you move in my peripheral vision.

829
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,780
Okay, pay attention to the game.

830
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,640
What's going on?

831
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:48,940
What's happening?

832
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,400
I just got a phone call from my neighbor and she was like, are you okay?

833
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,440
And then I'm like, oh look, that is me.

834
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,900
Look at all the alcohol I drank today.

835
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,720
Wait, have you taken any sips yet?

836
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,380
Oh.

837
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,960
I've been drinking since like the beginning of this stream.

838
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,140
Okay.

839
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,020
So I didn't realize this was the level select, so I was like really freaked out.

840
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,160
And like, I was walking around and just being like...

841
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,680
You know, I was like, oh my god, a ghost is going to appear down this hallway.

842
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,460
Like a star there.

843
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,840
Wait, so this is a level select?

844
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
Yeah, this is literally a level select.

845
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,200
Oh, it's not like the actual game?

846
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
No, it's not the actual game.

847
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,960
And that like...

848
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,780
Like, that freaked me out for the longest time because like...

849
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,240
What was that sound?

850
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,840
Don't say that.

851
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,920
Don't say that.

852
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,720
You didn't hear that though?

853
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,860
The game turned down low.

854
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,940
That's why your chat keeps going, hey, it's low Doki.

855
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,440
And then look at where the master volume is.

856
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,320
Past Doki knows what's up.

857
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,080
Okay.

858
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,440
Oh.

859
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,220
Have you gotten this far before?

860
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,820
Yeah, I got to where I picked up an item and then started a chapter and then I stopped playing.

861
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,620
You piked up an item?

862
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,040
I'm not okay.

863
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,880
Your character's sanity will affect your gameplay.

864
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,080
Standing too long in the dark will decrease your character's sanity amongst various other elements.

865
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,540
Okay, so I...

866
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,160
Basically, when my sanity gets lower, there's more like paranormal activities that goes on.

867
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,200
You're in the dark right now.

868
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,520
Yeah, but I'm in the character select.

869
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,640
Okay.

870
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,380
Oh my God, even the light thing.

871
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,080
I don't think it would be telling you that unless it mattered right now.

872
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,400
Oh my God.

873
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,520
Oh my God.

874
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,600
I hate this.

875
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Even like the click clack is like so loud.

876
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,700
Oh, yeah, you're...

877
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,600
I don't know if they...

878
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,500
Guys, did her mic peaking thing fixed itself yet or not?

879
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,340
Handles...

880
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,000
Am I still peaking?

881
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,040
Yeah, she's still peaking, guys.

882
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,500
Sanity events occur randomly throughout the game.

883
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,840
Oh my God.

884
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,740
Yeah, you're still peaking.

885
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,920
Yeah, I could hear the peaking.

886
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,900
You gotta fix that part.

887
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,500
Let me look at my mic too.

888
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,580
No, my mic's fine.

889
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,600
My mic's always fine.

890
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,620
Okay.

891
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,000
Peek-a-boo.

892
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,880
What's that?

893
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,800
Oh, it's the radio.

894
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,990
This is so PT.

895
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,810
Yeah, I know that's...

896
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,150
Yeah, be prepared to broken lights.

897
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:36,490
Okay.

898
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,470
I don't think this is level select.

899
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,770
I think this is the tutorial.

900
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,570
It's tutorial slash level select.

901
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,250
How do I put the...

902
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:45,950
Can I fix it?

903
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:46,730
Yay!

904
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,250
Alright, I replaced the light bulb.

905
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,230
Why can't I just leave?

906
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,930
Yeah, I know, right?

907
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,990
Oh, it's jammed.

908
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,550
Get a hammer.

909
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,370
It's jammed.

910
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,190
Can I just get a hammer and just smash that and just leave?

911
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,470
I prefer when it's peanut buttered.

912
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,470
Okay, so UCC, this is one of the levels.

913
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,010
This is the other one.

914
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,090
There's one upstairs, but that's not the one we're getting.

915
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,970
What was that?

916
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,530
Stop, stop.

917
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,410
Stop.

918
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,450
Stop.

919
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,010
Oh, there's like footsteps behind you.

920
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,430
Stop.

921
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,970
Like there's double footsteps.

922
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,630
Okay, there's meds here.

923
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,010
Okay.

924
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,590
Pills acts as an aid for your character's sanity.

925
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,050
Oh, you need that.

926
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,430
Yeah, I need to take my meds right now.

927
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,170
Alright.

928
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,110
I didn't read it properly.

929
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,150
How do I put it in my inventory?

930
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:50,790
Oh.

931
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,370
I don't know.

932
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,170
Guys, I didn't read it properly.

933
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,050
What do I... How do I...

934
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,570
Stop.

935
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,270
Did you hear that?

936
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,470
Pills here.

937
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,150
Pills here.

938
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,710
What if I swear I'm actually gonna take the pills?

939
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,230
Oh, it's swinging.

940
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,430
Oh my god.

941
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:15,730
That's a ghost.

942
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,910
Candles can be placed here.

943
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,470
Oh, something's gonna come out of that.

944
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,130
Oh.

945
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,770
Oh, I should never turn that off.

946
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,810
Oh, they have so much toilet paper.

947
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,070
Oh my god.

948
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,730
They have toilet paper in here.

949
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,110
And pasta dental.

950
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,770
Pasta dental?

951
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,650
Pasta dental?

952
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,270
Okay.

953
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,550
That looks like...

954
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,330
It's like a tomato paste.

955
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,030
Yeah.

956
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:43,690
What's this?

957
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,630
Oh, ibuprofen.

958
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,590
I need that.

959
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,930
Let's take ibuprofen together.

960
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:49,750
You...

961
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,870
What if we just, you know, take some ibuprofen together in the bathroom?

962
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,690
Oh, they have that...

963
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:58,890
There's cough syrup.

964
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,510
Yeah, there's cough syrup.

965
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,730
And there's like...

966
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,450
What's it called?

967
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,350
The pink juice?

968
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,810
The pink juice?

969
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,770
The pink...

970
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,870
Oh, the Pepto-Bismol.

971
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,150
Yeah, Pepto-Bismol.

972
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:09,970
The pink juice.

973
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,190
I don't think it's...

974
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,550
No!

975
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,110
I took my meds!

976
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,530
No, I'm straight up!

977
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,410
No, don't take it off!

978
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,270
No!

979
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,750
I am very...

980
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,570
Okay, I need...

981
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,270
Okay, let's see.

982
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,850
Switch hands...

983
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,030
Hold...

984
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,190
Drop...

985
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,510
Use...

986
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,240
How do I...

987
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,490
Okay.

988
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,470
Now, it's on my right hand.

989
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,410
Okay.

990
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,160
No, I took my meds.

991
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,130
What if you, like, scroll wheel?

992
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,310
Does that do anything?

993
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,610
No, no, no.

994
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,510
Wait, it's like...

995
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,450
Okay, switch hands...

996
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:44,970
Crouch...

997
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,510
Run...

998
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,170
Quick save.

999
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:46,530
Okay.

1000
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:50,950
Hold...

1001
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,490
Use...

1002
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,510
Zoom...

1003
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,370
No, I can't do anything.

1004
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,910
I can't do anything.

1005
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,550
Okay.

1006
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,550
Click on the spot in the inventory?

1007
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,450
Oh, I did it.

1008
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,710
I did that.

1009
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:02,810
What was that?

1010
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,030
Stop.

1011
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,950
It's not me!

1012
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,510
It's the game!

1013
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,050
Oh my...

1014
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,290
It's playing!

1015
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,610
Which level are we doing?

1016
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,690
I'm gonna turn that radio off.

1017
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,990
That's annoying.

1018
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,910
Yeah.

1019
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,410
Okay, so we got the key.

1020
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,590
Which is the first level?

1021
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,330
Okay, we're not doing that.

1022
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,990
We have the key.

1023
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,730
Wait, why are we not doing that?

1024
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,270
There's only two levels in this game, and...

1025
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:33,750
There's only...

1026
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,910
It's this level...

1027
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,450
That's not...

1028
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,790
You literally said there was one upstairs!

1029
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,470
I think we should ask...

1030
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,390
The Dragoons who donated their hard-earned money for charity.

1031
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,770
Which level they would like you to do.

1032
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,370
If you donate...

1033
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,630
Post your receipts right now.

1034
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,310
Post it under Doki's hashtag.

1035
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,610
I will literally fact-check.

1036
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,510
And I will be like...

1037
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,590
This person said...

1038
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,650
This one.

1039
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,390
And then it's...

1041
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,250
Hold on, I'm going to your Twitter.

1042
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,550
Are you like...

1043
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,410
Registered?

1044
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,710
Do you have your voter ID with you too?

1045
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,550
Post it under hashtag...

1046
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,290
Doki Bird or Birdseeders.

1047
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,850
I will check.

1048
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,110
Yeah, Birdseeders.

1049
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,210
Do you please post your receipt...

1050
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,790
Of the money you donated to the charity.

1051
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,830
And then what you're...

1052
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,970
What chapter you would like me to do.

1053
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,230
Yeah.

1054
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,250
And I'll...

1055
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,030
We'll do it.

1056
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,610
We'll fact-check you.

1057
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,850
But you have to...

1058
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,590
Okay, but also...

1059
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,410
Don't dox yourself.

1060
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:30,970
You can...

1061
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,070
You can censor...

1062
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,670
Just censor any important information in there.

1063
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,630
And then like...

1064
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,850
But you have only 5 minutes to post.

1065
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,690
Mint, do you want my SSN too?

1066
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1067
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:44,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1069
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,330
Yeah, if you're so willing.

1070
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,110
So then you get to pick.

1071
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,830
And then we'll have a...

1072
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,850
We'll count the votes.

1073
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,410
And...

1074
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,310
We'll count the votes.

1075
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,810
And make sure that everyone is properly registered.

1076
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,630
Wait a second.

1077
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,630
I'm just gonna go with like the first one we see.

1078
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,210
Because...

1079
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,370
I mean, you have to do all of them anyway.

1080
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:58,810
Exactly.

1081
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,250
SSN address.

1082
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,310
The bank account.

1083
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,910
Your maiden's name.

1084
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,690
Your mom's maiden's name.

1085
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,930
The name of your first pet and everything.

1086
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,330
Alright.

1087
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,750
Oh, where you went to school.

1088
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:18,270

1089
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,190
The name of your first school.

1090
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,410
The name of your first school.

1091
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,590
Your favorite car.

1092
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,670
Your favorite teacher.

1093
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,250
Your blood type.

1094
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,210
I don't even know my blood type.

1095
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,030
Just to be safe.

1096
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,030
If you're like...

1097
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,510
If you're properly registered in the...

1098
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,770
In the...

1099
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,630
The ToeKeeper elections.

1100
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,490
We'll also need your birth certificate too.

1101
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,470
Just to be sure.

1102
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,030
Birth certificate.

1103
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:42,790
Your birth certificate.

1104
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:43,810
House deed.

1105
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,890
Yeah, yeah.

1106
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,110
The deed of your house.

1107
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,350
And if you're in debt or not.

1108
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,850
I keep hearing footsteps behind you.

1109
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,270
I know.

1110
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,790
If I don't look back, I'll never see them.

1111
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,770
Oh, and then if you're an organ donor.

1112
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,110
That's the most important part.

1113
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,870
I'm not seeing anyone vote.

1114
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:01,270
Oh, wait.

1115
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:01,810
Latest.

1116
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,870
Oh!

1117
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:03,270
Oh!

1118
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:03,690
Let's see.

1119
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,830
Um, okay.

1120
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,390
We have a couple.

1121
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,270
We have a couple?

1122
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:06,630
Already?

1123
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,750
I said...

1124
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,570
Okay, wait.

1125
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,310
I need to see this now.

1126
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,210
What do you mean by a couple?

1127
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,770
Uh, Noxten.

1128
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:14,930
Noxten.

1129
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:15,790
Okay, no, I didn't...

1130
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,150
Let me...

1131
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,630
Let me check, uh...

1132
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:18,870
Uh...

1133
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,770
Said, do the second level first.

1134
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,250
Reminder that she has to do every chapter for the 90K characters.

1135
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,910
What the heck is the second level?

1136
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,290
What is considered a second level?

1137
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,850
Yeah, which one is that?

1138
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,750
I'll look it up.

1139
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,170
I'll look it up.

1140
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,650
I got you.

1141
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,470
Visage levels.

1142
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,050
Okay.

1143
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,150
Visage levels.

1144
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,510
Dolores' chapter?

1145
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,410
There's only four, Doki.

1146
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,270
Okay, that is four too many.

1147
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,930
Like, that's three too many already.

1148
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,470
Um, okay, but like...

1149
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:50,500
But like...

1150
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:53,070
Uh...

1151
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,830
Oh, we looked at the first one, right?

1152
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:55,170
The game isn't paused.

1153
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:55,570
Alright.

1154
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,610
No, okay.

1155
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,130
Oh, fuck.

1156
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,350
Okay.

1157
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:58,890
No, it is.

1158
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,210
It is.

1159
00:43:59,250 --> 00:43:59,870
I tapped out.

1160
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,150
Okay.

1161
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:00,830
Oh, okay.

1162
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,230
Thank God.

1163
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,090
Okay, I tapped out.

1164
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:02,630
Okay.

1165
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,950
Alright.

1166
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,730
Okay, we're doing the first...

1167
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,510
Guys, guys, we're doing the first one.

1168
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,870
We're doing the, um, the first person that posted.

1169
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,570
So, oh, I'm so sorry, FaintSmile.

1170
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,190
You were just a minute too late.

1171
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,290
I guess we're just gonna do the second level first.

1172
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,090
Oh, no, but FaintSmile did it more.

1173
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:25,850
No, no, no.

1174
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,210
You did say...

1175
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,870
You did say...

1176
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,430
No, no.

1177
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,650
No, I think that the higher amount should get priority.

1178
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,710
Oh, you're making amendments to the clauses now.

1179
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,310
And you know, amendments need to be voted by the full party.

1180
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,790
The upstairs level seems very sought after.

1181
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,010
That could be the second level, who knows?

1182
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,210
What do you mean very sought...

1183
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,710
It's one guy.

1184
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,490
It's one to one.

1185
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,890
No, no, no.

1186
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,010
I'm sure, I'm sure Noxton meant the second level.

1187
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,490
Oh, so like, Noxton's opinion doesn't matter.

1188
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,570
That's what you're trying to say.

1189
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,330
No, I'm saying what...

1190
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:56,950
Are you trying to say that?

1191
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,650
Translating what Noxton meant.

1192
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,990
He said second level is Dolores's chapter.

1193
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,530
No, that's just...

1194
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:05,190
I actually...

1195
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,550
Sorry, that was...

1196
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:07,390
Hold on.

1197
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,230
Oh, and then...

1198
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,650
That was GameRant.com and they're always wrong, so...

1199
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,150
So don't...

1200
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,410
GameRant.com Okay.

1201
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,710
Oh, Cody just said the...

1202
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,790
Said the what?

1203
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:25,210
What?

1204
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:25,510
Oh.

1205
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:25,770
Wait.

1206
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:26,630
Oh, what happened?

1207
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,070
He said...

1208
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:27,270
What?

1209
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,030
What happened?

1210
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:29,670
What happened?

1211
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,290
The screen share disappeared.

1212
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,010
Oh, the screen...

1213
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,070
Oh, no, it's back.

1214
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,370
Sorry.

1215
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,090
Hi, Noxton Amtet here.

1216
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,150
I thought it was you, Anton.

1217
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,070
Oh my gosh.

1218
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,850
Upstairs sounds like cooler content.

1219
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:42,990
Do that for charity.

1220
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,350
I'll see.

1221
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:43,610
I'll see.

1222
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,590
Okay, I'll do...

1223
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:45,890
Okay, look.

1224
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,370
Now you're just getting peer pressured by Mint, guys.

1225
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,010
Now you're just getting peer pressured by her, but like...

1226
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,010
You should have never...

1227
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,510
Doki, you did the first thing that you should never do.

1228
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,490
You showed weakness.

1229
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,450
The first level.

1230
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,890
And you said which chapter was the worst.

1231
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,830
First level.

1232
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:03,870
So I guess we're gonna do the second chapter, guys, which is...

1233
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:04,550
Wait, is it this one?

1234
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,050
Check the hashtag.

1235
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:05,650
I'm checking.

1236
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:06,050
Oh.

1237
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:06,810
Is it this one?

1238
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,590
Nexi also said...

1239
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,670
Oh, Nexi.

1240
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,030
Holy...

1241
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,270
What?

1242
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,230
Oh my God.

1243
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,270
Wait, what?

1244
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,270
Wait, what?

1245
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:15,610
What?

1246
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,110
What?

1247
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,770
The amount that Nexi donated.

1248
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,230
Holy hell.

1249
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,230
They also said...

1250
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,670
Okay, but did they put their birth certificate?

1251
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,770
Did they...

1252
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,250
Are they registered to vote for her?

1253
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,450
Alright, time to go upstairs.

1254
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,550
Time to go upstairs.

1255
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,370
Everyone's so generous.

1256
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,310
Thank you guys for donating all that time ago.

1257
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,410
Yeah, thank you.

1258
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,670
But like...

1259
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:46,890
Yep, keep going.

1260
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,470
Okay, time to go.

1261
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,770
But like, there's some...

1262
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,830
Wait, can you reshare...

1263
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,250
Rescreen share?

1264
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:51,730
Oh, is it?

1265
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,150
Yeah.

1266
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1267
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:54,830
Did it not work?

1268
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,510
Okay, oh my God.

1269
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,030
I just hear them go...

1270
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,450
What are you talking about?

1271
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,510
It's like in the screen share.

1272
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,150
It's just...

1273
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,650
It's still not sharing.

1274
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:14,990
Hold on, I'm gonna leave.

1275
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1276
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,090
Oh, it turned on by itself.

1277
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:20,410
Okay, I'm back.

1278
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,850
Okay, do you see it?

1279
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,490
Yeah, it sounds like an ice cream truck.

1280
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,510
Oh my God.

1281
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,770
Okay, so this is the...

1282
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,530
This is the upstairs level.

1283
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,270
No, it's not!

1284
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,090
No, it's not!

1285
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,150
Go upstairs.

1286
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:54,370
What?

1287
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,550
Is this it?

1288
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,530
No, it's not.

1289
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,470
I'm trying to remember where it is.

1290
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,150
Oh, candles can be placed.

1291
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,770
You've been in the dark for a while.

1292
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,130
Oh, nice!

1293
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,700
What's this?

1294
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,880
Can you tie him in a knot?

1295
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,480
Can you tie him in a bow?

1296
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,980
It's the panda drawing.

1297
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,800
Oh, the panda?

1298
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,080
Okay.

1299
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,440
Let's go!

1300
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,820
Oh, pandas are cute!

1301
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,560
It's the panda drawing.

1302
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,180
What's so scary about this one?

1303
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,380
It's the PT one.

1304
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,480
Oh, this whole game feels pretty PT already.

1305
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:48,080
Oh my God, why is the child sick?

1306
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,880
What the hell is that?

1307
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,780
Oh yeah, it's telling you to not be in the dark or something.

1308
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,160
No!

1309
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,500
Come on, Noki!

1310
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,120
Okay, let me just...

1311
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,420
This house is huge.

1312
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,220
This is still just a kid level select.

1313
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,060
This is why I didn't get past the level select.

1314
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,460
Oh my God.

1315
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,560
But you already watched someone play it, so you'll know everything already.

1316
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,580
I don't remember.

1317
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
I was drunk and it was years ago.

1318
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,680
Let me take a sip real fast.

1319
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,580
Oh, they're telling me to make me even quieter.

1320
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,080
Okay, yeah, I can turn you down right now.

1321
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,200
Let me...

1322
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,580
Where's your face?

1323
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,180
There you go.

1324
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:33,840
Okay.

1325
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,480
I don't know.

1326
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,300
What do you have me at?

1327
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,700
I have you at 174 and 10.9.

1328
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,260
Oh, I think you can put me down to like 100.

1329
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:41,760
Oh, really?

1330
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,160
Okay.

1331
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,500
Oh, did you fix your mic thing?

1332
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1333
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,120
Why did it turn off?

1334
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:47,660
Oh, I don't know.

1335
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,320
Oh my God, why did...

1336
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,900
Okay, I need to pause the game.

1337
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,200
It like literally turned off the lights by itself.

1338
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,780
I think you did that.

1339
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,700
Okay.

1340
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,520
Okay.

1341
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,240
Okay.

1342
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:03,880
Okay.

1343
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,140
Alright, is her volume...

1344
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,940
Is her volume better now, guys?

1345
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,700
Hey, guys.

1346
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,240
Oh, you're trying to say they can't hear anything.

1347
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,140
It's because I paused the game.

1348
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,380
What do you mean?

1349
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,940
The game volume is low.

1350
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,400
Okay.

1351
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,280
Option audio.

1352
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,240
Okay.

1353
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,740
Okay.

1354
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,160
Okay.

1355
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,260
Is she okay now, guys?

1356
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,220
Is her mic volume okay now?

1357
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,420
I think so.

1358
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,480
I said much better.

1359
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,020
I saw people.

1360
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,080
Alright.

1361
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:46,840
Okay.

1362
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,660
There's nothing happening.

1363
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,420
You can't hear anything because...

1364
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,060
Okay, taking this item will begin a chapter.

1365
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,200
There are two types of key items.

1366
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:58,680
Cement.

1367
00:50:59,260 --> 00:50:59,640
Cement.

1368
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,340
They are usually discernible key items.

1369
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,100
Is that why you didn't want to go to this one?

1370
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,420
It's the cement.

1371
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,600
It's the cement level.

1372
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,460
Okay.

1373
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,780
You found the drawing of the panda.

1374
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,380
What's gonna happen?

1375
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,960
Oh, Lucy!

1376
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,180
Lucy's chapter.

1377
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,420
Who's Lucy?

1378
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:23,920
Lucy!

1379
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:24,740
Lucy!

1380
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,200
I hate this.

1381
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,560
Turn the light on.

1382
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,220
You know something.

1383
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,360
No, I turned on this light.

1384
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,040
Little baby.

1385
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,040
Little baby.

1386
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,620
Oh, you can... Wait, can you hide in there?

1387
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,180
No.

1388
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:41,700
No.

1389
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,320
There's no hiding from this.

1390
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,800
How are you supposed to...

1391
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,380
What's that sound?

1392
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,960
Did you hear that?

1393
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,440
Oh, that just opened.

1394
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,430
Knock, knock.

1395
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:09,630
I think you need to knock back.

1396
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:11,990
Hello?

1397
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,290
Hello?

1398
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:16,630
Hello?

1399
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,130
Hello?

1400
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,610
Okay, give me...

1401
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,550
Wait a second.

1402
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,050
I need to wait for the alcohol to hit.

1403
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,740
We just started!

1404
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,340
Okay.

1405
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,200
Who's a brave kitty cat?

1406
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,840
Not me.

1407
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,400
Not me.

1408
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,380
Meow.

1409
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,100
Not me.

1410
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,800
Meow.

1411
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,340
Meow.

1412
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,020
Meow.

1413
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,200
Four, three, just...

1414
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,680
Doki kept just going, meow.

1415
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,240
Meow.

1416
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:11,440
Meow.

1417
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,480
Meow.

1418
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,340
I was so convincing.

1419
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:16,300
Meow.

1420
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:17,700
Meow.

1421
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,460
Oh my god, my dog is like, who's that?

1422
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,580
Oh, he was convinced it was a cat.

1423
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1424
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:29,640
Meow.

1425
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,360
Meow.

1426
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,320
Dad doesn't like meow.

1427
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,280
Okay, he's never seen a cat before, so...

1428
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:43,460
What?

1429
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,560
Yeah, yeah, I don't know how he's gonna react.

1430
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,280
I don't know what that is.

1431
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,640
He's like, what is this creature you speak of?

1432
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,120
Okay, okay.

1433
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,180
Hopefully...

1434
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,300
Oh my gosh, have you ever played Lifeline?

1435
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,140
Lifeline?

1436
00:53:59,240 --> 00:53:59,880
No, what's that?

1437
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,400
It's a voice controlled, like, RPG.

1438
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,260
Oh.

1439
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,180
You should play it.

1440
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,660
Oh, really?

1441
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,400
Is it scary?

1442
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,620
No, it's actually not scary.

1443
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,260
Oh, wait, how does, like, what's the, like, premise of the game?

1444
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,620
Uh, you're on, like, this space station and aliens invade.

1445
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,040
So I was blowing my nose.

1446
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,840
Yeah, it's sci-fi.

1447
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,260
And then you control the lady to fight and stuff.

1448
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,740
Oh, yeah.

1449
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,760
Yeah, it's really fun.

1450
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,140
It sounds interesting.

1451
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:33,940
You should play it, yeah.

1452
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,760
Okay, the way, the more you talk about it, the more I'm, like, less convinced that it's, like, a scary game.

1453
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,000
It's not scary, it's not.

1454
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:42,820
Okay.

1455
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,900
I mean, there's some scary parts of it, but...

1456
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,800
Oh, you have to scream at what?

1457
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,340
Yeah, you have to yell at the lady.

1458
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,620
Okay, wait.

1459
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,360
I think he's actually hungry.

1460
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,520
I'll be right back real quick.

1461
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:55,420
What?

1462
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,440
I'm not stalling!

1463
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,980
My dog needs food!

1464
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,700
Uh, why did you feed him earlier?

1465
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,330
Guys, I'm gonna have her play Lifeline.

1466
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:12,010
The dog made me think of it, because I think of Rio.

1467
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,830
The girl's name is Rio, and she goes, little bark, or big bark.

1468
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,010
That's what made me think of it.

1469
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,750
But we're gonna have her play, and she's gonna lose her mind, too.

1470
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,060
I'm back.

1471
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:34,960
Alright.

1472
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,460
Welcome back.

1473
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:35,900
Okay.

1474
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,800
This is gonna be a long couple of months of this game.

1475
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,580
Months?!

1476
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,600
I don't think we're gonna make it a lot, but I think it's gonna take us a couple of playthroughs to finish the first chapter.

1477
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,720
I believe.

1478
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,420
Come on, guys!

1479
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:54,800
Oh.

1480
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:55,420
Oh.

1481
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,580
You scared me.

1482
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,760
Everything looks the same.

1483
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,660
You turned around so fast.

1484
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,360
God, I hate this child.

1485
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,980
Can you die in this game?

1486
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:04,580
Yes.

1487
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,660
That was a quick save.

1488
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,280
Where do I go?

1489
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,540
Was that her down there at the end of the hall?

1490
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,420
Shut up.

1491
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,660
Shut the fuck up right now.

1492
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,720
I was just asking.

1493
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,220
Can't ask questions anymore on Doki Birthday.

1494
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,200
Ew, what is that hair hanging on?

1495
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,460
Who decorated this place?

1496
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,680
Oh, that door is open now.

1497
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,260
Oh, it's like a little teddy bear!

1498
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,620
It's like a little teddy bear!

1499
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,180
Well, Doki, maybe you shouldn't have killed your kids.

1500
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,700
I'm just saying.

1501
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,700
It was roleplay!

1502
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,600
She said it was roleplay!

1503
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,060
Roleplay gone wrong, 3am.

1504
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,660
Oh my god.

1505
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:03,860
Do I have a reflection?

1506
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,800
I'm a ghost.

1507
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,480
No.

1508
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,220
I'm a vampire.

1509
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,960
I have a reflection.

1510
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,380
I'm not a vampire.

1511
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,860
I'm a vampire.

1512
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,480
Vampire baby.

1513
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,300
I mean, this seems like a happy family.

1514
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,640
Maybe.

1515
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,340
Is there anything in the closet?

1516
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,460
Oh my god, these clothes hanging up.

1517
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,360
I keep thinking they're people.

1518
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,580
The bed looks so cozy.

1519
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,420
I'm not gonna lie.

1520
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:32,780
I know, right?

1521
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,040
Like, oh, there's only one person in that bed.

1522
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,520
What do you mean there's only one person?

1523
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,640
Yeah, I mean like only one person got out of that bed.

1524
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,360
Oh, the other person could be clean and they, you know, made their side of the bed.

1525
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,620
Why are you turning lights off?

1526
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,260
I don't know anymore.

1527
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,980
Oh wait, the door downstairs opened.

1528
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,760
Oh, we're gonna go into the cement.

1529
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,820
Let's go down, down, down, down.

1530
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,360
Down, down, down, down.

1531
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:04,400
I wonder if I could just pay someone to like record me playing, like record me pretending to play the game.

1532
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,900
And then I just put myself over the video.

1533
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,380
This is for charity.

1534
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,840
I'll pay the person to make the video.

1535
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,200
Oh, it's your favorite, cement.

1536
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:18,640
Yeah!

1537
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,640
Okay, we got cement.

1538
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,680
Doki hates children, confirmed.

1539
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,180
Oh, 100%.

1540
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,560
It did not have to be confirmed.

1541
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,880
Wait, what was your charity for?

1542
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,020
It was for mental health.

1543
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,980
Oh, look, Jesus.

1544
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,020
You could turn the light on.

1545
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,060
We're still lit.

1546
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,260
I think that's the room we're in.

1547
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,040
Oh wait, there's a lady there.

1548
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,820
That could be...

1549
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,280
What room is that?

1550
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,940
I can't turn it off now.

1551
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,400
Wait, where's the...

1552
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
What room is that?

1553
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,240
That's Lucy, right?

1554
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:00,960
Lucy?

1555
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,840
How do I know how crazy I am right now?

1556
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,580
I can't tell.

1557
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,320
Do you have a brain?

1558
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,360
The brain will show up in the bottom left.

1559
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,400
Why are you pausing?

1560
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,060
I can't tell if I'm crazy or not.

1561
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,640
I can't tell.

1562
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,000
How crazy am I?

1563
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,120
The brain in the bottom left will show you.

1564
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,860
It just shows red.

1565
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,800
How do I know if I'm going crazy?

1566
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,420
How would I know?

1567
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:28,880
What if my crazy is my normal?

1568
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,190
I don't know.

1569
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:34,810
Well, take your meds.

1570
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:35,810
You pick some up.

1571
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,930
But Blake, I have limited meds.

1572
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:39,710
I can't just take my meds.

1573
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,730
I can't go over...

1574
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:42,950
You know, if you take too much, you might overdose.

1575
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:50,230
Well, if you actually play the game, then you'll progress and you won't have to take them so often.

1576
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,610
Okay, you're right.

1577
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,310
I think we have to go find her, no?

1578
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:57,610
Yeah, but where's Cement?

1579
00:59:58,690 --> 00:59:59,830
Where would Cement be?

1580
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:01,210
Cement?

1581
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,010
Well, no, I don't think she's in Cement.

1582
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:05,530
It's Shand.

1583
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,530
Yeah, but why would I get Cement?

1584
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:10,030
I saw a record player.

1585
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,530
Did you see a record player anywhere?

1586
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,650
Yeah, I saw that.

1587
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,790
Can I just break the vases?

1588
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,390
We gotta go find her.

1589
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,530
If going down is up...

1590
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,370
Oh, there you go.

1591
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:25,650
You got it.

1592
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,970
Yay!

1593
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,390
How do you open doors?

1594
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:30,590
Oh, it's pull.

1595
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:32,550
Pull.

1596
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:33,130
Keep pulling.

1597
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,690
Oh, god.

1598
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:35,690
Okay.

1599
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:36,830
Okay.

1600
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:38,830
Yippee.

1601
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,130
Open a door.

1602
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,110
Hello?

1603
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,090
Oh, god.

1604
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:43,330
Who is...

1605
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,810
What do you mean you need the basement key?

1606
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,190
Who decorates this?

1607
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,590
Yeah, who decorates this?

1608
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,530
That is like...

1609
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:49,830
It's like serial killer.

1610
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,830
I mean, wait, he is though, actually.

1611
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:54,050
Wait, you're right.

1612
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,450
He did kill his family.

1613
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:56,250
Yeah.

1614
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:57,310
Oh, my god.

1615
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:57,850
That's a light.

1616
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:58,910
I thought that was a person.

1617
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,250
If you look at this, it looks like a person.

1618
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:00,770
I saw it.

1619
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:01,690
It looked like a person.

1620
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,090
You're in the corner.

1621
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,070
Hello, am I in cement?

1622
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:10,010
Cement.

1623
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,290
Where is the light?

1624
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,650
I think...

1625
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:16,950
I think you should come back with a candle, no?

1626
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,030
You're right.

1627
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:18,570
You're gonna go crazy.

1628
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:19,850
You're right.

1629
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,550
Try the other door.

1630
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,430
Oh, wait.

1631
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:22,970
I got a lighter.

1632
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:24,550
Oh, nice.

1633
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,030
Oh, there you go.

1634
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,190
Okay.

1635
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,530
Do not prevent stress build up, okay?

1636
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:31,970
Okay.

1637
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:34,610
Standing in the dark with a lighter will decrease your character's sanity.

1638
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:35,970
Okay, good to know.

1639
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:40,590
But I still need to see what the fuck is going on.

1640
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:48,110
Oh, I heard her.

1641
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:48,850
Stop.

1642
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,150
Did you hear her?

1643
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:50,910
Stop.

1644
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,110
You don't hear her going...

1645
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:53,210
No, I did.

1646
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:53,730
You don't hear her?

1647
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,630
No, I did.

1648
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,570
Chat, did you hear that?

1649
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:57,330
No, I did.

1650
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,550
Doki, where are you looking?

1651
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,710
Why aren't you moving?

1652
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,910
Doki, come back to us.

1653
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,270
I'm getting a voicemail.

1654
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,430
Come back to us.

1655
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,050
I'm getting a voicemail.

1656
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:20,710
How do I...

1657
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,430
What do you mean you're getting a voicemail?

1658
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:23,810
How do I turn...

1659
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,390
How do I turn this off?

1660
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,790
Turn what

1661
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:30,980
idea off?

1662
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,020
I don't know.

1663
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,820
Why would you want to?

1664
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,100
Because it's limited.

1665
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,280
The field is limited.

1666
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,620
I don't think it is.

1667
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,420
Sorry, they're still using my voicemail right now.

1668
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,020
What are you talking about?

1669
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:49,760
Your voicemail?

1670
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,400
I got a call.

1671
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,020
And they're leaving a voicemail because I didn't pick it up.

1672
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,700
The voices are speaking to me.

1673
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,720
How long is this voicemail?

1674
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,960
Holy fuck.

1675
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,980
It's still going.

1676
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:13,520
I can't cancel it too because they're clearly leaving me a message right now.

1677
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,260
You're like downloading the message.

1678
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,780
Your mod is telling you to bring the volume up of the game.

1679
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,280
I'm trying to breathe right now, one at a time.

1680
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,840
I'm trying to remember how to breathe.

1681
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,680
God damn, this voicemail is so long.

1682
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,760
They're still leaving a voicemail right now.

1683
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,560
I swear to God, this is an automated thing.

1684
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,660
It's just running to the end right now.

1685
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,420
I swear to fucking God.

1686
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,940
It came from a toll-free number too, so I don't know.

1687
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:59,360
It's probably one of those robots that don't call.

1688
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,240
I think it's a robot call.

1689
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,720
Should I just cancel it?

1690
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,640
Nah.

1691
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,280
What if it's a ghost calling you?

1692
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:08,500
Lucy?

1693
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,920
Lucy, is that you?

1694
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,620
I wish a robot would call me.

1695
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,880
I just saw you on TV a minute ago.

1696
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,700
Oh my God, Lucy.

1697
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
She's famous.

1698
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,560
Oh my God, she's so famous.

1699
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,920
Look, she didn't forget about the little people like us.

1700
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,460
She's like, you're my biggest fan.

1701
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,760
So I'm giving you a personalized DM.

1702
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,640
I remember you supporting me when I was just in the underground cafes.

1703
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,320
Hi, Doki Bird.

1704
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,300
It's me, Lucy.

1705
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,680
I'm actually... I know you're a huge fan of mine.

1706
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,940
And actually, my car just broke down.

1707
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,540
Do you think you could spare 20 bucks for me?

1708
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,740
So I could Uber to a mechanic.

1709
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,260
Don't worry, I'll pay you back.

1710
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,080
And you'll definitely get the VIP tickets to my next performance.

1711
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,420
Yeah, I'm Lucy, so you know I'm rich.

1712
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,800
I just lost my wallet.

1713
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:11,580
And don't worry about how this number is totally free.

1714
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:16,300
You know, I'm just trying to save money, you know.

1715
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,400
Alright, I'm canceling this voicemail.

1716
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:18,980
I'm done.

1717
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,720
Holy cow.

1718
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,220
Wait, are you sure it's not you?

1719
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,720
Do you have one of those like...

1720
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:22,800
No.

1721
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,300
Okay, it's me, Doki Bird.

1722
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,780
No, I'm very... I'm very...

1723
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,100
Okay, wait.

1724
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,980
Let me double check if they actually... the voicemail actually...

1725
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,620
Oh, they did not register.

1726
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,180
I canceled on their voicemail.

1727
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,980
Guys, I don't think I should have pressed canceled on the voicemail, guys.

1728
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:42,980
Because they actually...

1729
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:44,280
Google the number.

1730
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,300
Okay, you're right.

1731
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,160
I'm gonna Google the number.

1732
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:47,260
Alright.

1733
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,400
Alright, let's see.

1734
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,800
It looks like you're a doctor.

1735
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,280
Somebody like Doki Bird, this is the most important news.

1736
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,920
We just got your test results and I...

1737
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,840
Oh no, I Googled the number and it doesn't show up.

1738
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,640
Oh, then it's... it's definitely...

1739
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,100
It's definitely a toll-free?

1740
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,360
Or like a scam?

1741
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:08,920
Probably not.

1742
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,460
What if it's like someone's personal number?

1743
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,680
That's a toll-free service.

1744
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,260
Well, what if you know them then?

1745
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,700
I don't know.

1746
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,300
Maybe it's like...

1747
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:18,860
Maybe it...

1748
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:20,080
Maybe it's from...

1749
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:20,440
Definitely losing.

1750
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,180
Maybe it's from the CRA.

1751
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,020
The Canada Revenue...

1752
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,400
That's our IRS, by the way.

1753
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,740
That's the Canadian IRS.

1754
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,360
Maybe it's the Canadian IRS calling me.

1755
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,720
I think you should keep playing the game.

1756
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,420
Okay.

1757
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,140
Okay, I got this.

1758
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,780
That's my suggestion.

1759
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,000
You mean chat suggestion.

1760
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,900
No, no, it's mine too.

1761
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,500
I'm just saying.

1762
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,140
How do I turn...

1763
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,720
Guys, guys, I still haven't learned how...

1764
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,960
Guys, I still didn't learn how to turn off my lighter, guys.

1765
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,340
That was the whole reason why I paused.

1766
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,160
How do I turn...

1767
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,080
How do I turn off the lighter?

1768
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,000
Guys, I can only swap hands.

1769
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,740
Guys, the lighter is limited fuel.

1770
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,020
How do I turn it off?

1771
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,280
How do I turn it off?

1772
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:07,940
I can't.

1773
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,580
I can't.

1774
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,400
I'm not stalling.

1775
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,480
I don't know.

1776
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,000
I don't know.

1777
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,620
How do I close the lid?

1778
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,920
How do I close the...

1779
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:19,900
Man, you can't judge me.

1780
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,680
You don't even know.

1781
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,300
You aren't even helping me.

1782
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,140
You don't even know the answer.

1783
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,700
This is the first puzzle.

1784
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,400
I've never played this game before.

1785
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,540
This is the first puzzle.

1786
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,820
How do you turn off the lighter?

1787
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,900
And you don't know.

1788
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,120
I've never played these games before.

1789
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:39,980
How do I turn off the lighter?

1790
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,520
Maybe you look at the controls.

1791
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,660
It doesn't say how to turn off the lighter.

1792
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,080
It just says door control.

1793
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,980
I'm simple, please.

1794
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,080
Move inventory slot Q.

1795
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:55,240
What?

1796
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,640
Where does it say Q?

1797
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,640
Move inventory slot Q.

1798
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,540
There's no Q in there.

1799
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,260
It said under controls.

1800
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,260
It didn't?

1801
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:06,640
Okay.

1802
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,920
But how do I turn off the lighter?

1803
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,440
You just did.

1804
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:11,780
Oh, I hold it.

1805
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,480
Yeah, you just hold it, man.

1806
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:15,760
Die.

1807
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:19,800
Hello?

1808
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,080
Oh, I hear her.

1809
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:22,820
Stop.

1810
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,700
You don't hear her?

1811
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:25,500
Stop.

1812
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,220
No, I did.

1813
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,600
I just pretend I didn't.

1814
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,580
She's coming for you.

1815
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,200
She's coming for you.

1816
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,820
Put the toys back in their place.

1817
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,420
No yelling.

1818
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,660
Ask dad for the keys if you need some.

1819
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,060
Don't try to go...

1820
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:37,940
I'm not in the dark.

1821
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,820
I'm in the candle.

1822
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:40,920
No, remember it said...

1823
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,040
Oh, that's the candle, yeah.

1824
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,640
I think she's right in there.

1825
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,680
Yeah, she's right there.

1826
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,900
Maybe give her a toy.

1827
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,950
Oh, why would you do that?

1828
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,990
Oh no, I thought the TV will turn on.

1829
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,350
La la la la la la.

1830
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,290
Oh, I'm in the dark for too long.

1831
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:07,170
No, you're in the light of the...

1832
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,430
What if you go in there?

1833
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,270
Oh my god, she's doing laundry.

1834
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,110
What a woman.

1835
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,610
The light turned on.

1836
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,270
The door opened.

1837
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:16,910
Oh, the light turned on.

1838
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,590
See, she's still helping you out, actually.

1839
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:24,670
Hello, Lucy?

1840
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:25,730
Caution.

1841
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:27,490
Do not enter.

1842
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:28,650
Read backside.

1843
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:33,010
Kids, you need something, go ask dad in his office upstairs.

1844
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:33,770
Okay, dad.

1845
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,010
Who's taking pictures, creep?

1846
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,510
Oh!

1847
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:41,450
Hello?

1848
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:43,270
Hello?

1849
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,190
Teacher warning.

1850
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,570
Is she coming?

1851
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,490
Did she show up in the camera?

1852
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,090
Lucy?

1853
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:00,350
Lucy?

1854
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,930
Lucy, did you call me?

1855
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,470
Lucy, you have something to say?

1856
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:07,910
What?

1857
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,630
Oh, there's the trail.

1858
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,430
Oh, nasty.

1859
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:12,670
Hello, Lucy.

1860
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,850
Oh, I got goosebumps right now.

1861
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:15,990
Maybe you should follow it.

1862
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,750
Oh, there's like a little drawing.

1863
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,630
Yeah, what if I just go right side?

1864
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:20,590
Bye, Lucy.

1865
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:21,010
Okay.

1866
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,030
Bye, Lucy.

1867
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,090
Goodbye, Lucy.

1868
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,010
She says...

1869
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,590
And I never come back.

1870
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,270
Teacher warning.

1871
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,190
It's too fast.

1872
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,310
I can't process this.

1873
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:33,030
Yeah, how do we process this correctly?

1874
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,110
What's that sound?

1875
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,310
I think that's Lucy.

1876
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:37,970
What's going on in there?

1877
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:39,790
This house is too big.

1878
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:40,710
You see that?

1879
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,670
Oh, yeah, I see that.

1880
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,130
We see... what if we just never meet Lucy?

1881
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:47,990
You could do that.

1882
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,090
Oh, it's leading you there.

1883
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:52,230
Yeah, see?

1884
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,610
It's literally pointing in that direction.

1885
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:56,730
We're like... not following horrible...

1886
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,370
Oh, never mind.

1887
01:10:58,450 --> 01:10:59,730
It led me all the way back here.

1888
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:01,470
That's what I told you!

1889
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:06,590
Just go try.

1890
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:06,910
Oh, wait.

1891
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:07,370
Quick save.

1892
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:07,890
Quick save.

1893
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:08,390
Oh, you're right.

1894
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,790
You're right.

1895
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:09,850
Okay, F5.

1896
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,750
There we go.

1897
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:19,630
What if I just walk up to you?

1898
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:20,130
Hey, Lucy.

1899
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,250
Oh, she's getting up.

1900
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:24,250
Oh, she won't let me get near her.

1901
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,170
Let me near you.

1902
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:26,210
Lucy, hey!

1903
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,690
Oh, do you have a candle for me?

1904
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:32,810
Oh, she just gave that to you.

1905
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,070
See?

1906
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,990
She's nice.

1907
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:35,470
Why are you looking away?

1908
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,190
Goodbye, Lucy and Lucy.

1909
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:39,070
Oh, there she goes.

1910
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:40,570
She's moonwalking away.

1911
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,500
Bye, Lucy!

1912
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,280
She disappears.

1913
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,060
Okay, now I can move forward.

1914
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:50,840
What is that?

1915
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,720
She gave you... Oh, it's a syringe.

1916
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,020
Okay, this game cannot save.

1917
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,140
Save manually if needed.

1918
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

1919
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,300
I need to save.

1920
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,200
We literally just tried... Oh, it disappeared.

1921
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,580
Into my slide I go.

1922
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:07,960
Alright, guys.

1923
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,720
I don't like this camera because it's like...

1924
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,120
What was that?

1925
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,100
Finish your basement.

1926
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,440
They make like the biggest house ever and can't even finish their basement?

1927
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,180
I have a lot of stuff going on in my life right now.

1928
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,620
I still haven't unpacked by the way ever since I'm moon.

1929
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,380
And then my noose ends in like 2-3 months, I think.

1930
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:34,780
What?

1931
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:35,420
Wait.

1932
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,620
Oh, that's just a shadow.

1933
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,960
That's just a shadow.

1934
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,240
Wait, who builds a house like you?

1935
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:41,820
Oh my god.

1936
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,820
Who builds a house like this?

1937
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,200
I think I'm in the backside of the house.

1938
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,040
Seizure warning, everybody.

1939
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:48,840
Seizure warning.

1940
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,320
You wanted Lucy chapter!

1941
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,560
Oh my... Wow.

1942
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,040
My brain.

1943
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:54,920
Say hi to her.

1944
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,600
My brain.

1945
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:59,480
My brain.

1946
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,480
My brain is not doing so well.

1947
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:02,520
What do you mean?

1948
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,200
I need to take my meds.

1949
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,820
Oh, I think you do, yeah.

1950
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,340
It's okay.

1951
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,380
The less I see my brain, the healthier I am.

1952
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,400
Uh-huh.

1953
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,100
This is like my only source of light.

1954
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,220
Which is like not good because...

1955
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:22,840
I'm sorry.

1956
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,000
Seizure warning.

1957
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,940
Why did the music stop?

1958
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:29,260
I can be alone in my thoughts.

1959
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:30,960
I don't think I can.

1960
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,740
I feel like there should be more items that I'm not picking up.

1961
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,160
Yeah.

1962
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,740
Oh, there you go.

1963
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:38,040
Nice.

1964
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:38,420
Alright.

1965
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:40,760
Oh.

1966
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,900
Oh, like that?

1967
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,560
You can pick up...

1968
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,800
You can pick up fucking cans?

1969
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:46,980
I don't know.

1970
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,660
You can sell them for something.

1971
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,920
I hate this.

1972
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:52,540
I fucking hate this.

1973
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,460
Why is the music...

1974
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,720
Why is the ambiance gone?

1975
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,140
I hate this.

1976
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,440
It's way too quiet.

1977
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,560
That means something's gonna happen.

1978
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,060
Why are these drawers...

1979
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,780
Oh my god, I scared myself.

1980
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,660
I guess I'm trying to help.

1981
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,820
Open it up.

1982
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,120
Oh, a lightbulb.

1983
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:11,420
Nice.

1984
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,220
Oh my god, I need this.

1985
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,540
You need that?

1986
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,620
Lightbulb, good.

1987
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,640
What's in there?

1988
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,040
What's in there?

1989
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,200
Oh guys, you wanna know what it looks like when the gamma ray is all the way up?

1990
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,060
Oh, actually, I kind of am curious.

1991
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,200
This game is less scary now.

1992
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:35,690
Wait.

1993
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:36,450
Wait.

1994
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:37,810
There it is.

1995
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:38,950
Oh my god.

1996
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,730
Oh my god, I can see everything.

1997
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,710
Oh my god, you can see everything.

1998
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:47,030
All I'm saying is, past Doki knows what's up.

1999
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:51,450
You couldn't even start the game and you had it this high?

2000
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:52,910
Yeah.

2001
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,450
Oh my god, I don't need to use the camera anymore.

2002
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:55,710
I think you took those cans.

2003
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,510
I'm not gonna lie.

2004
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:57,990
I think they were in your inventory.

2005
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:58,850
Wait, are they?

2006
01:14:58,910 --> 01:14:59,370
No, they're not.

2007
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,290
Oh, wait, they are.

2008
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,670
What am I gonna do with the cans?

2009
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:03,970
I told you.

2010
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:04,770
Bureau o'clock.

2011
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:06,150
Bureau o'clock.

2012
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:06,870
Bureau o'clock.

2013
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:07,450
Wait.

2014
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:08,970
Oh my gosh.

2015
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,830
Your pills were like...

2016
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,590
Oh, your brain is doing really bad.

2017
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:13,370
Oh, wait.

2018
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,690
It's not doing so well.

2019
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:15,910
Let me...

2020
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:16,290
Okay.

2021
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,190
Don't worry, I have two.

2022
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:20,350
Double the...

2023
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,650
The other pills were like floating around.

2024
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:25,830
Okay.

2025
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:28,670
Don't worry, let me turn the camera back.

2026
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,990
It was like here, right?

2027
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:33,130
Right here.

2028
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:34,210
Alright.

2029
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:34,510
Sure.

2030
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,190
Press accept.

2031
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:40,690
Okay.

2032
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,050
Okay, let's keep going.

2033
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,010
You cannot store this.

2034
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:44,470
Oh, wait.

2035
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:45,930
Wait, which is this?

2036
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,230
I think you used all your pills.

2037
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:49,090
This one?

2038
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:49,950
Alright.

2039
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:51,970
Okay.

2040
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:54,350
Alright.

2041
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,070
Okay.

2042
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:56,390
Keep going.

2043
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,170
I would walk around.

2044
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:00,210
Instead of using this, I would walk around with the lighter.

2045
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,990
Okay, but what if something interesting happens?

2046
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:07,710
Why did you do that?

2047
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:08,590
I don't know.

2048
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,530
Wait, I dropped my lighter.

2049
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,770
Why do you have the can?

2050
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:12,370
Wait, I dropped my lighter.

2051
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:14,150
Where did my lighter go?

2052
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,270
Oh, your brain is getting bad again.

2053
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:18,510
Is this my lighter?

2054
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,270
There it is.

2055
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:21,470
Okay.

2056
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:23,870
Hello?

2057
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:24,170
Hello?

2058
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,900
Oh, you have the basement key.

2059
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,440
Where am I?

2060
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,320
I have no idea.

2061
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,340
This house is nuts.

2062
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,180
I'm so confused.

2063
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:45,900
Hello?

2064
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,700
Oh, we just made a circle.

2065
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,900
That's where we saw Lucy.

2066
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,560
This is...

2067
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,680
Oh, the storage room.

2068
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,780
Any dynamic items?

2069
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,360
Just open the door.

2070
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,240
Okay.

2071
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,380
Okay.

2072
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,160
What was that?

2073
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:19,100
Lucy?

2074
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,140
Daddy's not happy.

2075
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,380
Daddy's not happy.

2076
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,600
Lucy, you're gonna get the gun again.

2077
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,740
You don't want me to bring back Roleplay.

2078
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,280
What did they hate?

2079
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,840
They hated this guy so much they hung his picture in the storage closet.

2080
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,600
Oh my god, what is that big thing?

2081
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,700
Oh, I could've turned on the lights.

2082
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,240
Oh my god.

2083
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,300
I'm gonna clock.

2084
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,080
You're gonna clock.

2085
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,300
You don't like it when daddy brings out the gun.

2086
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,620
I don't think the lighter has fuel.

2087
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,260
There's no fuel gauge.

2088
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,420
No, it does.

2089
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,300
It does have fuel.

2090
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:07,400
Where?

2091
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:08,320
I don't see it.

2092
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,680
This light is not broken.

2093
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,200
Oh, turn it on.

2094
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,220
It was broken.

2095
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,340
Someone's tummy is growling.

2096
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:21,520
Wait, you should go read these.

2097
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,540
Okay, read the rules.

2098
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,680
Put the toys back in their place.

2099
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,340
You can't touch the toys.

2100
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,400
Yes, you can.

2101
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,780
Oh, you can't use that.

2102
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,100
Oh, it's because I'm holding the light.

2103
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,720
Or the light bulb.

2104
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,600
Yeah, the light bulb.

2105
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,540
Wait, now you switch it out with the lighter.

2106
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,120
So you have to have a hand free, I think.

2107
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:48,460
Yeah, but I have to have my other hand with the meds or I'm gonna hear the voices again.

2108
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,320
Oh, hey.

2109
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,220
What's that?

2110
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,280
It's the light.

2111
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,960
Oh, you found a candle.

2112
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,840
Candles that can be moved around with a candle will cause it to extinguish.

2113
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:06,100
They last a long time and act to help increase your...

2114
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,460
Oh, wait, I like that.

2115
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,220
You can put one right there.

2116
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,340
Where is one?

2117
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,500
You just grabbed it.

2118
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,220
I know, but where do I put it?

2119
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,480
Turn around, back in that room.

2120
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,240
In here?

2121
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:19,820
Yeah, you can put it there.

2122
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:20,880
Yeah, but that's a waste.

2123
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,300
There's a lot of...

2124
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,720
Yeah, that's a waste though.

2125
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,320
I feel it.

2126
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,940
So, like, I should just hold on to it until...

2127
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,580
Until I don't.

2128
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,460
I would put it in your inventory.

2129
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,060
No, no, my meds!

2130
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:33,740
No!

2131
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,440
No, the price of pharmaceuticals is getting higher!

2132
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:43,660
Jokey.

2133
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:45,420
Jokey.

2134
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,780
I don't have insurance!

2135
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,740
Oh, there's another light bulb.

2136
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:52,700
Wait a minute.

2137
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,840
Oh, my God.

2138
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:55,760
Is there anything in there?

2139
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,220
Oh, wait.

2140
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,980
That's where I keep my bodies.

2141
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,980
Just real play, guys.

2142
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,340
Just real play.

2143
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,920
I'm so lost.

2144
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,620
It did say on the electrical room...

2145
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,840
It said that you should go upstairs and ask dad for the keys or whatever, so maybe...

2146
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:16,720
You can go get the...

2147
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,060
The room key upstairs.

2148
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:23,180
You made a good point and I'm not gonna listen to you.

2149
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,420
What just happened?

2150
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,720
How did I go crazy?

2151
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,920
Yeah, what was that sound?

2152
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
I don't know and I don't like it.

2153
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:35,360
Huh?

2154
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,680
Okay, let's go upstairs.

2155
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,820
I'm not gonna look back.

2156
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,300
Nice.

2157
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:48,400
Nice.

2158
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,880
Now I'm less crazy.

2159
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:55,060
Oh, gross.

2160
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,020
Is it this?

2161
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,820
That one requires the basement key.

2162
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,800
You have the basement key.

2163
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,220
You just locked me out like that?

2164
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,120
You can do that?

2165
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:06,140
No.

2166
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:09,740
Hold.

2167
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,160
Maybe it's push.

2168
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:11,700
Push.

2169
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,200
Well, let me...

2170
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,460
Oh, my God.

2171
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:15,980
I'm locked out.

2172
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,560
Doki doesn't know how to open doors.

2173
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,680
I'm locked out.

2174
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,800
No, I'm actually locked out.

2175
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,160
Oh, wait.

2176
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:20,740
It was this way.

2177
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,420
Oh, you're not.

2178
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,700
I'm back.

2179
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,400
Yeah.

2180
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,610
This house is so brightly lit.

2181
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:32,390
We're fine.

2182
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:32,990
Okay.

2183
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:33,650
Oh.

2184
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,250
No.

2185
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:39,070
Where did I go?

2186
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:40,470
Lucy?

2187
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,170
Daddy's confused.

2188
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:47,290
Lucy?

2189
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:48,870
Lucy.

2190
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,150
Daddy doesn't know where to go, Lucy.

2191
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:55,870
I think you gotta go upstairs, no?

2192
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:57,830
Or you gotta go to daddy's study.

2193
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:00,790
Daddy's home?

2194
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:02,130
Daddy's home.

2195
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:03,750
Daddy's home.

2196
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:07,270
Why are the lights so flickering up here?

2197
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:08,850
I don't know.

2198
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:09,270
What was that?

2199
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:12,410
Whisper guys.

2200
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,570
Oh, I hear some whispering.

2201
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,530
It was only coming from the bathroom.

2202
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:18,030
As soon as you stepped away, it stopped.

2203
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,570
Yeah, I'm not going back there.

2204
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:22,510
Hello?

2205
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:23,470
This is...

2206
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:29,950
It might be broken.

2207
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:31,910
Why is it broken?

2208
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:32,710
Space kid.

2209
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,410
Use your gun.

2210
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,430
So true.

2211
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:37,610
That's right.

2212
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:41,090
I don't know what one thing that ghosts are afraid of.

2213
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:42,450
What?

2214
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:44,050
Bullets.

2215
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:49,050
Who's gonna tell her?

2216
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:50,850
Tell me what?

2217
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:54,290
Oh hey, this leads to the bathroom.

2218
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:55,370
Oh, okay.

2219
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,260
Hello?

2220
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,000
Hello?

2221
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:05,940
Hello?

2222
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,200
No, hello.

2223
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,020
No, hello.

2224
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,040
No, hello.

2225
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,220
Hello?

2226
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,200
Turn it on.

2227
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:17,580
Turn it...

2228
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:18,960
Okay.

2229
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,200
Okay.

2230
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:20,790
Okay.

2231
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:21,010
Okay.

2232
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,190
They're just trying to save electricity.

2233
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,410
Oh, you're right.

2234
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,730
I'm using too much of the electricity right now.

2235
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,070
I think they just turned the lights off again.

2236
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,290
Oh, they're fine.

2237
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:32,210
They're fine.

2238
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:33,350
What is that?

2239
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:34,290
It's coming from the sink.

2240
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:36,210
Oh no, wait.

2241
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:36,890
I hear something.

2242
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:41,430
It's coming from the sink.

2243
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,490
I'm scared.

2244
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,550
I don't know where to go.

2245
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,210
It's just the roaches.

2246
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,250
I'm lost.

2247
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:00,870
Confused.

2248
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,230
Try and find the study.

2249
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:04,310
Try and find the study.

2250
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:06,950
Oh, the camera.

2251
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:08,510
Oh my god, I forgot about the camera.

2252
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:16,490
Oh, wait.

2253
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:18,810
Hello?

2254
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:25,690
Wow, wow, wow.

2255
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,350
Oh, it's going towards the whispers.

2256
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:30,210
Why are you crawling up?

2257
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:42,550
I don't like this.

2258
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:43,710
You got some pills though.

2259
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:44,790
Pills here.

2260
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:46,610
Pills here?

2261
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,670
I would put...oh wait, you used your candle.

2262
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:49,350
Just kidding.

2263
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,250
Try and find a way to turn on the lights.

2264
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:58,950
See, I told you it's limited.

2265
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,010
See?

2266
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:01,630
What's limited?

2267
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:02,250
The fuel.

2268
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,670
I just got another one.

2269
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:08,330
I think that's in case you don't get the first one.

2270
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:11,190
No, I'm pretty sure the fuel is limited.

2271
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:12,410
Wait, what's that?

2272
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,030
That was some lore.

2273
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,210
It's a fucking newspaper.

2274
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:17,370
I'm not going to read that.

2275
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,040
Lucy, daddy's not happy.

2276
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,420
Lucy, daddy's not happy.

2277
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,120
Lucy?

2278
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:37,950
Daddy's not happy.

2279
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:41,330
Lucy?

2280
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,810
Daddy's getting pretty mad.

2281
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,550
Wait, did the door just open?

2282
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:51,330
Oh, it was open.

2283
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,550
It was open already?

2284
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:58,630
Daddy is disappointed in you, Lucy.

2285
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:00,290
What was the point of coming in?

2286
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,030
It just opened.

2287
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,050
Did you hear that?

2288
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:07,330
Yeah, I did.

2289
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:10,550
Something opened.

2290
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:13,690
You could see if...you could change the light bulb out.

2291
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:15,350
Oh, that's true.

2292
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:16,830
There's no light bulbs here.

2293
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:18,410
What about the lamp?

2294
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:19,810
No, that's for candles.

2295
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:21,190
I don't have an extra one.

2296
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:22,150
No, no, the lamp.

2297
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:23,770
The one with the lamp.

2298
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:25,490
Wait, is the safe open?

2299
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:27,590
I don't think so.

2300
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:28,250
No, it's locked.

2301
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:33,410
Lucy, daddy's gonna go a little cuckoo.

2302
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,330
Well, that was pointless.

2303
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:41,450
Yeah, that was pointless.

2304
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:43,530
What was the point of...like, what opened?

2305
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,770
Everything else is locked here.

2306
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,250
Lucy, I'm getting a little annoyed.

2307
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:53,030
Oh, it's red now.

2308
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:54,950
Wait, there's mist.

2309
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:57,690
A basement.

2310
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:01,010
It's gun o'clock.

2311
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:02,490
It's gun o'clock!

2312
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,550
At 335.

2313
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:06,710
Daddy brings out the gun.

2314
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,090
It's not 335.

2315
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:14,290
Oh, is this a cutscene?

2316
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:15,070
Yeah.

2317
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,250
Oh, I'm outside.

2318
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:17,530
Oh, thank god.

2319
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:19,910
Nothing bad ever happens outside.

2320
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:20,150
Does that say kill?

2321
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:20,550
Oh, yeah!

2322
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,210
A little heavy, huh?

2323
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:30,250
This is high quality graphics, by the way.

2324
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:34,390
Guys, the rain is so realistic.

2325
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:37,070
Oh my god, it's lagging so bad on Discord.

2326
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:37,990
Wait, really?

2327
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:41,410
Wait, am I on, like, the highest?

2328
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,650
No, you're not on the highest.

2329
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,590
Oh, I'm not?

2330
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:45,270
Okay.

2331
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:45,530
No.

2332
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:47,350
Okay.

2333
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:48,770
Just wanna be sure.

2334
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:55,130
At least, like... Am I, like... Wait, actually, what's, like, my graphics settings right now?

2335
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:57,930
High, but not the highest.

2336
01:27:58,050 --> 01:27:58,410
Oh, wait.

2337
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,450
Now we're extra quality.

2338
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,370
Oh, the bitrate might... The bitrate's probably dying because of the...

2339
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:04,930
The rain.

2340
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,190
Rain, yeah.

2341
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:06,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2342
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:08,670
There's not anything we can really do about that.

2343
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:11,050
Oh, hey, look.

2344
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:11,330
See?

2345
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:12,870
Everything's okay now.

2346
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:16,290
Guys, we're outs... Oh, look, there's Lucy Toys!

2347
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:17,430
Look at that!

2348
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:19,210
Look, she has a little turtle.

2349
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:22,570
Hello, Lucy.

2350
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:24,430
This is so not scary.

2351
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:25,090
Yeah, see?

2352
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,190
It's not scary anymore.

2353
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:26,950
We're outside!

2354
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:30,170
You could get through this chapter so easily.

2355
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:31,170
You know what?

2356
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:31,670
You're right.

2357
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:32,950
You're right.

2358
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:35,370
Let me take another sip, just in case.

2359
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:39,750
Are you fe... Oh, there's the panda!

2360
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:41,830
Oh, yeah, there's the panda!

2361
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:43,290
Wait, can I go crazy in here?

2362
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,970
Turn anti-alias on?

2363
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:47,010
Does that help?

2364
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:50,210
Someone's like, please don't get sweared again!

2365
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:52,790
What does that even do?

2366
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:53,970
Very high.

2367
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:55,770
Does it make the game better?

2368
01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:01,150
It's gonna make it look like it's a AAA title.

2369
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,210
Whoa.

2370
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:04,010
It looks the same.

2371
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,830
Call of Duty.

2372
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,150
Alright.

2373
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:14,350
Oh, there's a giant panda!

2374
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:16,890
Oh my gosh, she really fucking loves pandas.

2375
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:17,930
Yeah.

2376
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,190
Lucy, are you okay, Lucy?

2377
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,850
Oh my gosh, I see the panda.

2378
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,390
Yeah, I know.

2379
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,050
There's so many pandas.

2380
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:28,150
I know, she's like a peeping tom, peeking out of that tree.

2381
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:29,170
Peeping panda.

2382
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:30,470
Yeah, peeping panda.

2383
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:32,890
Ew, stalker panda.

2384
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:35,370
Why is there so many toys?

2385
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,510
If you weren't so creepy, maybe you wouldn't be endangered.

2386
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:38,990
Oh, that's true.

2387
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:40,130
You know how they don't know how to talk?

2388
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:41,110
They don't know how to have sex.

2389
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:42,430
What?

2390
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:44,510
Yeah, they're like...

2391
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:49,870
Because there's a really low birth rate of pandas, that's why they're endangered.

2392
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:56,690
And zoos in China have to play panda porn to help them get them in the mood.

2393
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,810
Wait, you didn't know that?

2394
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:00,730
No!

2395
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:03,170
No, yeah, so they don't...

2396
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:08,350
So they only mate once every couple of years or some shit?

2397
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:13,390
There's only a specific time frame that they'll actually get busy.

2398
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:17,110
But a lot of male pandas don't want to do it.

2399
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:23,530
Pandas are so lucky that they're cute, otherwise nobody would be going through this trouble.

2400
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:35,410
So when it's the time of the year, they have to play panda porn just to show them how it's done and get them in the mood.

2401
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:38,710
Oh my god!

2402
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:43,190
I'm kind of concerned why, like, what is that named?

2403
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:46,250
Like, is it named, like, on somebody's computer?

2404
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:49,130
Just panda porn dot mp4?

2405
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,050
Panda hub.

2406
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:58,010
Oh, I'm Lucy.

2407
01:30:58,410 --> 01:30:59,030
I'm Lucy.

2408
01:30:59,290 --> 01:30:59,710
Hey, Lucy.

2409
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:01,810
I want to be your friend, Lucy.

2410
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,110
No!

2411
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:05,530
Oh, the ghost comes out?

2412
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:07,650
Friend did it.

2413
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:10,090
Pico, what happened to Pico?

2414
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:11,070
Pico?

2415
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,950
Why is she gone?

2416
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,130
Lucy, what happened to him?

2417
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:20,630
Oh, someone says only pandas.

2418
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:22,430
Only pandas.

2419
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:25,690
Do you think they could use other bears?

2420
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:28,450
She's like...

2421
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:35,650
Are you a polar bear type of panda or are you a brown bear or a black bear?

2422
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:39,610
What kind of panda do you think you want to watch?

2423
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:43,170
It's just, you know, what if they don't have a preference for pandas?

2424
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:44,030
Are you a moon bear?

2425
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:48,150
They just see, like, bear porn and they're just like, yeah, that's all I need.

2426
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:49,570
That's all I need.

2427
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:50,850
Now I'm in the mood.

2428
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,810
Also, like, they're so stupid that if you...

2429
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:56,850
You can, like...

2430
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,870
Okay, so, like, it's very...

2431
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:03,310
Like, it's very rare for a panda to have twins or something.

2432
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:07,850
So, like, when a panda gets twins, they have to...

2433
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:10,950
They can't comprehend that they have more than one child.

2434
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:12,490
So they, like, swap...

2435
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:15,270
They have to, like, swap the babies back and forth.

2436
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:19,130
So, like, she would take care of both of them at the same time.

2437
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:23,610
That's like...

2438
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:25,490
Wow.

2439
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:27,230
No, what?

2440
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:27,810
Wow.

2441
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:29,830
How do I progress this?

2442
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,260
Oh, wait, there's a...

2443
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,020
Oh, there you go.

2444
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,760
I need a small key.

2445
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:36,880
You need the small key.

2446
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:38,600
I have a basement key.

2447
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,880
Is it in the drawer?

2448
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:41,840
Oh, maybe.

2449
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:43,100
Oh, I can't open it.

2450
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:43,780
Am I, like...

2451
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,240
Am I not supposed to be there?

2452
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,140
Maybe you can go back.

2453
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,040
I don't wanna go back.

2454
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,960
This area is nice.

2455
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,880
If you come here a second time, it's fine.

2456
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:55,320
Oh, check the pictures.

2457
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:56,340
I'm Lucy.

2458
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,340
Hi, Lucy.

2459
01:32:59,280 --> 01:32:59,700
Lucy.

2460
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,460
Lucy.

2461
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,660
I like my new...

2462
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,320
Oh, there it is.

2463
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:02,680
Oh.

2464
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,380
I wanna be your friend, Lucy.

2465
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,300
Yeah, Lucy, I wanna be your friend.

2466
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:12,300
Sorry for talking about pandas.

2467
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,040
Oh.

2468
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:13,740
Oh my...

2469
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:15,940
Oh, this is what she gave you.

2470
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:16,580
Oh, yeah.

2471
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,300
She's on men's.

2472
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:18,880
Wait, okay.

2473
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:19,620
Wait, what does it say?

2474
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:20,660
Oh, investigate it.

2475
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,380
Pick it up.

2476
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:23,800
Oh, yeah.

2477
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,820
Did I just look away?

2478
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,360
Oh, it just says Lucy.

2479
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:30,900
Lucy.

2480
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:33,060
Really?

2481
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:36,920
Okay.

2482
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,680
Oh, it's getting darker.

2483
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,040
I don't like that.

2484
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,460
Really?

2485
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:53,040
How do we save the pandas?

2486
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:58,980
Is there any other way we can do?

2487
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:00,820
Huh?

2488
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,420
Get rid of the pandas?

2489
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:03,720
No!

2490
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,320
No!

2491
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:05,820
Not the pandas!

2492
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:10,580
What do we get rid of?

2493
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,620
Get rid of what?

2494
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:14,780
What do you don't want?

2495
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:15,800
The bird?

2496
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:16,560
A bird?

2497
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,760
Pico?

2498
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:19,360
Pico!

2499
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,160
Why do we get rid of Pico?

2500
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,860
Oh, she's crying.

2501
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,340
Lucy.

2502
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:27,940
Do it, Lucy.

2503
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:30,040
Get rid of Lucy.

2504
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:31,660
Oh, I should save.

2505
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:33,380
Oh, okay.

2506
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,260
You always pick the best part.

2507
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,380
Do what?

2508
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,780
I think he wants you to do something.

2509
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,340
What do I do?

2510
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,480
She's just crying.

2511
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,840
Do I just listen to her cry?

2512
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,440
That's right, cry, Lucy.

2513
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:54,580
That's right.

2514
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:55,940
Hello!

2515
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:56,760
Hello!

2516
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,080
Goodbye!

2517
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,320
Goodbye!

2518
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:19,090
Did I fall down?

2519
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:21,790
Oh.

2520
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:23,570
You took too many meds.

2521
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:25,170
Yeah, just a little hallucination, guys.

2522
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:31,770
Why did she do that?

2523
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,350
That's so weird.

2524
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,850
Oh, wait, it's auto-save.

2525
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:37,850
Typical Sunday.

2526
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:40,270
Okay, now what do I do?

2527
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:42,350
Flash.

2528
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,290
Oh, it's standing in the dark.

2529
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:45,590
I'm not trying to!

2530
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:48,690
Why doesn't the TV count as not the dark?

2531
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:49,290
Yeah.

2532
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:53,190
Oh, wait, she really did take off.

2533
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:54,450
Wait, can you not turn on the light?

2534
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:54,950
Turn around.

2535
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:56,330
I don't know where the light switch is.

2536
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,010
Right there.

2537
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,050
That's so fucked up, Lucy.

2538
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:00,710
Daddy's not happy anymore.

2539
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:02,750
Daddy's very disappointed.

2540
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:04,510
Daddy's disappointed.

2541
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:06,330
Wait, look to the left.

2542
01:36:06,570 --> 01:36:08,870
I think you can follow the light covers.

2543
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:11,110
Oh, wait, you're right.

2544
01:36:13,710 --> 01:36:15,410
Daddy's going to his cabinet.

2545
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:20,290
Daddy likes the light covers, Lucy.

2546
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:29,030
Daddy needs the light covers to function, Lucy.

2547
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:36,410
Daddy paid good money for the light covers, Lucy.

2548
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:40,950
Lucy, are you going to go to Home Depot and fix this?

2549
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:42,230
I think not, Lucy.

2550
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,670
Turn it off.

2551
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:49,390
God, shut up.

2552
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:50,590
Shut up, Lucy.

2553
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:52,830
I think it goes upstairs.

2554
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:53,790
Oh, it does.

2555
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:55,930
God damn it, Lucy.

2556
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:59,210
That was at least $10 of light covers.

2557
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:01,070
My sanity is decreasing.

2558
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:02,050
Oh, shit, wait.

2559
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:04,430
Lucy, Daddy's not happy.

2560
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:07,650
Daddy doesn't have insurance, Lucy.

2561
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:12,270
Your light is nearly out.

2562
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:13,730
Okay, maybe you were right.

2563
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:15,730
Okay, let me...

2564
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:18,530
Your lighter is empty.

2565
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:20,210
That was so fast.

2566
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:21,950
Okay, bye.

2567
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,130
Just set the place on fire.

2568
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:26,630
Wait, how are we supposed to see?

2569
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:29,870
Oh, I hear her.

2570
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:35,010
This is where the light covers go.

2571
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:35,850
Where did it go?

2572
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:40,270
I think she's in that room, though.

2573
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:43,670
I'm not looking back.

2574
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:46,770
There she is.

2575
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:49,130
Only pills will keep you sane at this point.

2576
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,760
There she is, yeah.

2577
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,080
Daddy can't see.

2578
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,900
Daddy can't see, Lucy.

2579
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,240
Daddy's confused.

2580
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:03,360
Daddy's confused.

2581
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,960
Oh, maybe you just follow her so you hear her.

2582
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,800
I can't see anything!

2583
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,120
Use your ear!

2584
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,000
You don't need to see!

2585
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:18,420
I can!

2586
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,540
Wait, do I have more light?

2587
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:19,860
Oh.

2588
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:21,280
I have another one.

2589
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:21,920
Oh, nice.

2590
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:22,320
There we go.

2591
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:26,640
Okay...

2592
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,620
I hear her around this side.

2593
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,740
I hear her maybe in this room.

2594
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:35,820
Yeah.

2595
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,120
Is she taking a shower?

2596
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,080
Sorry, Lucy.

2597
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,100
How do I close this?

2598
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:46,320
Can you die from insanity?

2599
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:48,980
I think you can.

2600
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,200
Where did she come from?

2601
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,880
Wait, is this a death?

2602
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,920
Wait, is that death?

2603
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,500
Got your mouth!

2604
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:07,980
Lucy!

2605
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,820
What did I do?

2606
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,480
What did we do there?

2607
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,560
I don't know.

2608
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,360
She got my mouth.

2609
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,100
No more kisses, Lucy.

2610
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,260
She was all mouth.

2611
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,440
Oh my God.

2612
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,420
No more goodnight.

2613
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:31,700
Where am I?

2614
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:36,860
Where are you?

2615
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:37,640
I don't remember.

2616
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:38,100
Oh, here.

2617
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,260
Okay, so it auto-saved at the...

2618
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:43,900
What the?

2619
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,920
Maybe she's coming to get you.

2620
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:46,840
She was like, no!

2621
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,360
Do you leave?

2622
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,640
You could probably go...

2623
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,280
I'm not okay right now.

2624
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,040
I'm not okay.

2625
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,340
What the fuck?

2626
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:04,900
Oh my God, I'm taking my...

2627
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:06,780
I didn't know I wasn't okay!

2628
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,660
Oh, is my sanity really bad?

2629
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:11,940
Oh, maybe I should not have watched.

2630
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:18,380
Oh, wait, is she hunting me?

2631
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:20,320
Oh, she might be.

2632
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:23,100
Oh, I might have gone a little too crazy.

2633
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,020
Lucy, please, I didn't know.

2634
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,540
I didn't know I was going crazy.

2635
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,360
Oh my gosh, she took my nose again.

2636
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:36,860
Got your nose.

2637
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:41,720
She says this is after every time you've taken my nose.

2638
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,000
Take your pills.

2639
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:45,720
Right now.

2640
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:46,420
Oh, she has a cat.

2641
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,340
No, don't take my nose again!

2642
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,860
Okay, so I don't think I'm this bad anymore.

2643
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,260
Okay.

2644
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:15,020
Okay, wait, wait.

2645
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,320
Wait, I figured it out.

2646
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,580
Wait, no, I know what to do.

2647
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,300
I know what to do.

2648
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:18,580
You do?

2649
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:20,000
Okay, I know.

2650
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:22,960
What if you go hide in the closet?

2651
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,280
There's two closets to hide.

2652
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,480
Yes, there is the one that was in her room.

2653
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,460
Okay, wait, wait.

2654
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,140
Someone said take pictures of her.

2655
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:32,840
Okay.

2656
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,380
She just hobbles so much.

2657
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:36,520
She's a little vain.

2658
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,500
Let me take my pills first.

2659
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,180
Yeah, take your pills.

2660
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,200
Is it a chase sequence?

2661
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:47,600
No.

2662
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,670
I can't see anything.

2663
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,230
Me too, I'm a little scared.

2664
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:03,040
She's gonna come hobbling at us again.

2665
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,500
Okay, maybe she...

2666
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:05,280
Oh, this room is normal.

2667
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,140
Maybe she won't.

2668
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:08,100
What if she opens the door?

2669
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:09,140
She just comes in.

2670
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:10,200
I'll take another pill then.

2671
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,120
Just to be safe.

2672
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:15,160
You're gonna lose all your sanity hiding in the dark.

2673
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,940
Okay, but Lucy's hunting me.

2674
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:20,540
I don't hear her.

2675
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:21,940
I don't know that.

2676
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:28,210
Where do I go?

2677
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:28,830
Where are you supposed to go?

2678
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,410
Yeah.

2679
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:32,750
I did the thing they told me to do.

2680
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:35,950
It's not a waste.

2681
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:39,010
I literally had her chasing me for like 20 years.

2682
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:41,110
She took the light covers.

2683
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:42,170
What the fuck?

2684
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:42,690
From everywhere.

2685
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:43,290
Wow.

2686
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:46,410
Lucy sucks.

2687
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:48,770
She took everything.

2688
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:50,130
She took the house.

2689
01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:52,270
Someone said parents' bedroom.

2690
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:55,790
Guys, why didn't you tell me that sooner?

2691
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:01,740
Oh, the lights are back on.

2692
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:02,680
Oh, there she is.

2693
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,660
Go to the parents' bedroom.

2694
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:04,880
Go to the parents' bedroom.

2695
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:07,520
This is not the parents' bedroom.

2696
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:20,300
Lucy.

2697
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,180
What did you expect?

2698
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:37,180
I don't know.

2699
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,660
I left the doors.

2700
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,720
I left the doors to keep her out.

2701
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:47,100
I don't know.

2702
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:51,500
I thought she would just, you know, be like, oh, she's busy.

2703
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,760
I'll come back later.

2704
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,700
Lucy, daddy's in his study now.

2705
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:57,060
Yeah.

2706
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,340
Lucy, you're not allowed in daddy's study.

2707
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,460
Lucy, you can't just phase through.

2708
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:05,480
Why would she no clip through the door?

2709
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:09,100
Lucy is reclaiming her part of the will.

2710
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:11,760
Okay.

2711
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,440
Okay, before I get...

2712
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,100
Before she fucking kicks my nose again.

2713
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,640
Guys, what do I do?

2714
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,020
What do we do, guys?

2715
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:22,840
What do we do?

2716
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,700
How do we get out of...

2717
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:26,620
How do we get out of Lucy?

2718
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:27,820
How does she stop?

2719
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:29,480
Lucy's after the insurance money.

2720
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,640
Oh my god.

2721
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,900
Dude, did you hear about the Ghost Adventures guy and his wife?

2722
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:34,600
Wait, what?

2723
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:34,880
No.

2724
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:35,860
What about him?

2725
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,900
Also, who are they?

2726
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,780
There's one guy on the show Ghost Adventures.

2727
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:40,820
His name is Aaron.

2728
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,980
And recently it came out that his wife was plotting his murder.

2729
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:45,620
What?

2730
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:46,880
Yeah.

2731
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,520
She took his life insurance and stuff?

2732
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:50,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2733
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:57,500
She was working with some guy who was a murderer in jail and was just like plotting the guy's murder.

2734
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:58,700
Holy shit!

2735
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:01,120
Yeah, this all happened really recently.

2736
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:02,720
And...

2737
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,300
Like, how do you, like, did she just randomly send a letter?

2738
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:09,260
Like, she just looked up, like, recent murderers that are about to...

2739
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:12,040
She saw him in a true crime documentary.

2740
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,820
Also, like, how long has he been in jail for?

2741
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,240
Because don't, like, they stay in jail for, like, mostly for life?

2742
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:24,400
So how the fuck is he gonna get out of jail and kill him?

2743
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:28,020
Yeah, I was gonna say, like, how is he gonna get out of jail to kill him?

2744
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:30,380
I thought they'd be, like, there for life.

2745
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,920
And if they do get out, like, wouldn't they be on parole?

2746
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,540
Like, with an ankle bracelet?

2747
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:37,400
Maybe they thought...

2748
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,360
Maybe she was just like, he knows some people.

2749
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:39,980
I don't know.

2750
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,820
Life is 25 years?

2751
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:48,180
Imagine murdering someone and only getting 25 years.

2752
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:51,820
Imagine you're also just like, hey, I wanna murder this guy.

2753
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,260
I'm gonna wait 25...

2754
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:55,220
The most premeditated murder.

2755
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,720
Yeah, yeah.

2756
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:02,000
It's being like, oh my, no, she looks up for...

2757
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,180
No, what's like that murder?

2758
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:07,820
Oh my god, maybe he committed his murder, like, 24 years and 11 months ago.

2759
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,280
And he was about to get out of jail.

2760
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,420
He's like, see you next month, baby.

2761
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,160
See you next month.

2762
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,580
Murderers are about to get out of jail.

2763
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:22,640
What?

2764
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:28,900
25 is the minimum.

2765
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:32,060
Oh, I mean, that's still like...

2766
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,880
I guess if it's like an accidental murder.

2767
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,140
So like...

2768
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,860
Like, well, it was an oopsie.

2769
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,460
So like, 25 years.

2770
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,100
Anyway, sorry.

2771
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,600
I don't know why I thought about that.

2772
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:45,740
What do we do, guys?

2773
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,280
Someone made a good point.

2774
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,060
Like, they failed.

2775
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:52,460
They got made into a true crime documentary, which means they failed the murder.

2776
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,120
What do you mean?

2777
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,400
Because, like, they got caught.

2778
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2779
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:58,840
They got caught.

2780
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:01,140
Yeah, so like, why would this...

2781
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:03,300
It's like, don't worry.

2782
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,100
You know what to do to avoid getting caught this time.

2783
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:07,300
Oh, this time, yeah.

2784
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,480
They know what mistakes not to make.

2785
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:15,220
Yeah, they know the mistakes they made so they can hide the trail better.

2786
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:19,500
Okay, guys, what do we do?

2787
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:20,940
We're stuck.

2788
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,560
We're stuck in a death loop.

2789
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,180
Someone did say the bedroom, but it was one guy.

2790
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,300
I don't know if we're going to get one more.

2791
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:27,120
Yeah, we're going to get one guy.

2792
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:28,520
Guys, what do we do?

2793
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:31,660
Guys, this will be the fifth time.

2794
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,180
You run down the stairs.

2795
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,120
To where, then?

2796
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:38,380
Yeah, I was down the stairs, and then she came after me.

2797
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,320
Then you went back upstairs.

2798
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:40,480
Don't die.

2799
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:42,820
Run and hide.

2800
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:43,540
But where?

2801
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:45,060
Where do I hide?

2802
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,420
Trying to talk things out with Lucy.

2803
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:52,280
I did.

2804
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:53,800
I closed the door on her.

2805
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,580
How much more do I have to do?

2806
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:01,340
Tell her to go to her room.

2807
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,780
Oh, parent's bedroom closet is the...

2808
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:07,700
Oh, hey, the one guy here.

2809
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:08,800
I looked up the guide.

2810
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,140
Okay.

2811
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,000
All right, parent's bedroom.

2812
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:16,980
I know where that is.

2813
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:19,140
Can we bribe her with more light switches?

2814
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,780
Can I see your favorite thing, girl?

2815
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:24,740
Come here, girl.

2816
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:25,340
Come on.

2817
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,540
I just leave a trail light.

2818
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:29,480
Come on, Lucy.

2819
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,400
It's right here.

2820
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:32,760
Lucy.

2821
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:33,940
Come on, Lucy.

2822
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:42,600
To the parent's room.

2823
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,280
I think you might have to wait until she is...

2824
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:47,800
Until she is chasing you, no?

2825
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:50,400
No, I think she chases me when I'm crazy.

2826
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,900
Okay, then I will go.

2827
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:57,100
Okay, she still took the light cover.

2828
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:57,360
You tried.

2829
01:49:05,050 --> 01:49:07,070
I'm in the closet now, Lucy.

2830
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:08,450
I think you need to shut the door.

2831
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:11,930
Oh, when Lucy is chasing me?

2832
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:13,970
I think I hear her.

2833
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,830
Did you hear?

2834
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:15,850
I don't hear.

2835
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:17,870
Lucy.

2836
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:20,650
I thought I heard breathing.

2837
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:22,970
Wait, they lied.

2838
01:49:23,110 --> 01:49:23,970
There is nothing here.

2839
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,860
They are forcing you into the closet.

2840
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:34,760
I don't want to go in the closet.

2841
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:38,440
I hear something.

2842
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:39,840
You don't hear that?

2843
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,680
I do, but I'm pretending I don't.

2844
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:53,270
You have to start the chase.

2845
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:53,530
Okay.

2846
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:55,130
Oh, someone said quick save now.

2847
01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:56,130
That's a good idea, actually.

2848
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:56,830
Oh, no.

2849
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:59,050
Then I already wasted meds, so I'd rather not.

2850
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,010
Okay, nevermind.

2851
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:01,850
It's fine.

2852
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:02,990
We don't...

2853
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:05,650
Just don't forget to shut the door of the closet, okay?

2854
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:06,330
Okay.

2855
01:50:06,990 --> 01:50:07,890
I'm gonna forget.

2856
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:09,590
Wait.

2857
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:13,110
Use your lighter instead.

2858
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:19,890
Why is she chasing me now?

2859
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,510
Maybe I should just die.

2860
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:27,130
Why is she chasing me?

2861
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:27,470
Lucy!

2862
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:28,770
Daddy's mad!

2863
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:30,330
Chase me!

2864
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:33,730
Lucy, I'm reinstalling the light switches!

2865
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:34,850
Oh my God, Lucy!

2866
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:36,270
Guess who found new light switches?

2867
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:38,230
Lucy?

2868
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:40,570
Maybe she really hated the ones, actually.

2869
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:43,470
Okay, Lucy.

2870
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:44,310
Come on, Lucy!

2871
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:46,790
Lucy, chase!

2872
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:47,290
Chase!

2873
01:50:47,450 --> 01:50:47,850
Come on!

2874
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:48,850
Chase, Lucy!

2875
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:49,210
Chase!

2876
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:50,030
Oh, man.

2877
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:50,850
I should've...

2878
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:52,110
You're gonna regret doing this.

2879
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:53,550
You're gonna have to loop her now.

2880
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:53,990
Yeah, no.

2881
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:55,110
I should just die.

2882
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:57,990
Maybe if I just stand there, then she just gets my nose again.

2883
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,450
Wait, she's not hunting me at all.

2884
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:02,430
Oh, there she is.

2885
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:03,070
Oh, there she goes!

2886
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:04,870
Go, go, go!

2887
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:05,330
To the bathroom!

2888
01:51:05,810 --> 01:51:06,370
Goodbye, Lucy!

2889
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:06,690
Don't look!

2890
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:07,310
Don't look!

2891
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:07,790
Don't look!

2892
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:08,550
Don't look at her!

2893
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:09,030
Just go!

2894
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:09,330
Goodbye!

2895
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:16,750
If you fuck this up, I'm gonna be so mad.

2896
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:17,110
Hello?

2897
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:17,850
Lucy?

2898
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:18,510
Where is she?

2899
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:20,750
Wait, she didn't come in.

2900
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:22,690
That's right, this is the daddy's room.

2901
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:22,730
Daddy's room.

2902
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,530
That's right.

2903
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:31,170
You're not allowed in daddy's room.

2904
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:32,150
Wait, she didn't come in.

2905
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:35,730
Wait.

2906
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:37,290
What was that?

2907
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:39,870
There's another door in here?

2908
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:42,690
Oh, it goes to the kid's room.

2909
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:46,250
Why is there a door to Lucy's room in their closet?

2910
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:49,150
Just to make sure Lucy's okay.

2911
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:51,770
In the closet?

2912
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:53,310
Oh!

2913
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:59,890
I should turn this off though.

2914
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:02,270
Okay.

2915
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:07,190
Oh wait, that's the birdcage!

2916
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:07,950
Oh my God, Pico!

2917
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:09,490
Pico!

2918
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:10,410
Wait, no.

2919
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:11,530
How do I...

2920
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:13,790
I'm struggling to go through a hole.

2921
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:16,870
The hole is the goal!

2922
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:17,890
Pico!

2923
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:19,730
Is my sanity okay?

2924
01:52:20,690 --> 01:52:21,670
It's like pink.

2925
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:22,250
It's fine.

2926
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:23,910
Okay.

2927
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:26,090
Pico!

2928
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:29,870
Hello!

2929
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:32,970
Hello everybody!

2930
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:35,350
Oh, there's been a lot of Pico's in there.

2931
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:36,250
Oh my God, how many Pico's?

2932
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,170
Okay, I think she's gonna be chasing you in here.

2933
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:39,490
Yeah, I think so too.

2934
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:40,710
What am I supposed to do?

2935
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:42,070
Leave?

2936
01:52:42,350 --> 01:52:43,130
Use your lighter.

2937
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:44,870
Like, actually be able to see.

2938
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,050
What's the fun in that?

2939
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:55,270
Okay, if you wanna be playing this game for actual literal years...

2940
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:56,610
Yeah, and then you'll be there with me.

2941
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:02,050
I have...

2942
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:03,370
Did you see that?

2943
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:06,290
Oh, there's the exit.

2944
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:09,950
Am I supposed to open these?

2945
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,170
Maybe.

2946
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:13,470
Hey there!

2947
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:15,550
Oh, I think this is a stealth portion.

2948
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:16,630
I would go.

2949
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:17,450
Go to the door.

2950
01:53:17,610 --> 01:53:18,190
Go to the door.

2951
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:19,150
Go to the door.

2952
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:20,110
Go to the door.

2953
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:21,230
Where is she going?

2954
01:53:21,450 --> 01:53:22,110
Go to the door.

2955
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:22,690
It's locked.

2956
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:23,750
It's locked.

2957
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:27,210
Where is she?

2958
01:53:27,330 --> 01:53:28,090
She just disappeared.

2959
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:32,830
She actually did just disappear.

2960
01:53:33,190 --> 01:53:35,130
She never came back.

2961
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:36,350
Is that her?

2962
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:37,730
Oh, she doesn't know.

2963
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:40,170
She's stupid.

2964
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:43,050
Oh God, our child is dumb.

2965
01:53:43,110 --> 01:53:44,770
Oh no, you did this.

2966
01:53:44,830 --> 01:53:47,870
I told you not to sign her up to those classes.

2967
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:49,790
I think she's coming for you.

2968
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:51,230
You're not stupid, sweetie.

2969
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:52,410
You're not stupid, sweetie.

2970
01:53:54,970 --> 01:53:56,910
Sweetie, daddy's just joking.

2971
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:04,090
Should've signed her up for Kumon, damn it.

2972
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:08,350
Daddy's just fucking around.

2973
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:11,370
You know, daddy's being a little silly goofball.

2974
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:14,870
Go find the... Oh, there she is.

2975
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:15,610
She's camping.

2976
01:54:15,610 --> 01:54:17,010
That's not fair.

2977
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:19,570
Like, I can't see anything, too.

2978
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:20,790
Use the lighter.

2979
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:22,530
Yeah, but it's limited.

2980
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:23,790
I can't see.

2981
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:24,790
Yeah, but this is the part.

2982
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:26,550
This is when you should use it.

2983
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:30,630
Yeah, but like, I can't see, like, close enough.

2984
01:54:32,370 --> 01:54:33,550
Where did she go?

2985
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:35,930
Guys, guys, guys.

2986
01:54:35,970 --> 01:54:37,010
Can I cheat, guys?

2987
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:40,370
I think here you can cheat.

2988
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:42,430
Yeah, guys, come on.

2989
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:47,410
I'm thinking about seizure warnings, okay, guys?

2990
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:50,250
I'm thinking about the seizure warning.

2991
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:51,490
I mean, you do have a lighter.

2992
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:53,390
Yeah, but it's limited.

2993
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:55,510
The game is not paused.

2994
01:54:56,730 --> 01:54:58,350
Where did she go?

2995
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:00,090
I don't know.

2996
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:02,430
Like, the thing is, like...

2997
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:07,290
Like, this gives me more view ahead, though.

2998
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:07,990
That's the thing.

2999
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:11,310
I hear her.

3000
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:21,410
Can I open this?

3001
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:22,770
Yeah, okay, I opened all these.

3002
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:24,490
There must be something in these drawers.

3003
01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:27,030
Like, why else would...

3004
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:31,050
I sure hope that it doesn't, like, it stays in the same spot every time.

3005
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:32,970
If you die, you know what I mean?

3006
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:35,230
Oh, there's some drawers to the right.

3007
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:35,850
To the right, to the right.

3008
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:38,390
To your left.

3009
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:39,030
Left.

3010
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:40,450
There, there.

3011
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:43,150
No.

3012
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:44,350
No?

3013
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,430
There's something... There's a place over here.

3014
01:55:46,510 --> 01:55:47,490
Oh, there's... Right there, right there.

3015
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:49,850
Yeah, right to the... There, there, yeah, yeah.

3016
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:51,910
Look inside.

3017
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:53,130
Oh.

3018
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:54,410
Okay.

3019
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:56,090
Oh, there it is.

3020
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,550
Yay!

3021
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:03,520
Lucy?

3022
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:04,940
Lucy.

3023
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:06,740
Daddy.

3024
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:08,920
Daddy not happy.

3025
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:10,680
Daddy wants to go home.

3026
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:11,920
Oh, shit.

3027
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,380
Oh, no.

3028
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,820
That's so stupid.

3029
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:28,000
Oh, nevermind.

3030
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:30,300
I was gonna say, I don't think she's gonna get you anymore.

3031
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:31,460
Wait, I can run.

3032
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:33,380
You can?

3033
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:41,840
Sorry, Lucy, I leave now.

3034
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:43,800
I think you should run now.

3035
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:46,300
Seems like the perfect...

3036
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:49,900
I've been casually walking this entire time.

3037
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,460
Uh-uh.

3038
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:54,460
I'm not looking back.

3039
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:56,440
I'm not looking back.

3040
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,320
Pico!

3041
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:01,880
Pico!

3042
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:02,700
Pico!

3043
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:04,700
I don't think that's Pico.

3044
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:07,500
Wait, what is that?

3045
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:08,480
Pico?

3046
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:11,460
Oh, it's like a little...

3047
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,580
Yeah, but...

3048
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:13,120
I can't turn it on.

3049
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:13,880
It's a little wooden bird.

3050
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,900
I can't turn it on.

3051
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:18,160
Pico?

3052
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:18,760
Nah, keep going then.

3053
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:19,760
Pico?

3054
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:21,580
Keep going.

3055
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:22,280
Pico?

3056
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,360
I don't think Pico.

3057
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:23,920
I don't think Pico.

3058
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,660
Wait, it's jammed.

3059
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:27,920
Under the blood?

3060
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:31,300
Why can't I turn it on, Pico?

3061
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:33,040
Pico, talk to me.

3062
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:33,520
Take a picture.

3063
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,040
Take a picture.

3064
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:35,800
No, it doesn't flash anymore.

3065
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:39,540
Wait, there's something...

3066
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:41,200
Hello?

3067
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:44,340
Pico?

3068
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:46,600
Pico!

3069
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:48,360
Pico!

3070
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:48,940
Pico!

3071
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:52,860
Pico disappeared.

3072
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:54,560
Wait, there's no doors.

3073
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:55,620
Hello?

3074
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:56,960
Oh, there's a little girl in the corner.

3075
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:57,380
Lucy?

3076
01:57:58,380 --> 01:57:59,840
Lucy, what happened to Pico?

3077
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:01,280
She's eating the bird.

3078
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,340
Lucy, what happened to Pico?

3079
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:03,740
Take a picture.

3080
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,180
I'm trying to.

3081
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:06,460
Hi, Lucy.

3082
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:08,380
Daddy's not mad.

3083
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:09,220
Daddy's...

3084
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:09,980
Can you use the...

3085
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:10,420
Oh, nevermind.

3086
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:10,880
Okay.

3087
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:12,540
Oh, the other door disappeared.

3088
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:13,160
Oh, yeah.

3089
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:14,800
There's another door.

3090
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:16,980
I don't really think she ate the bird.

3091
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:21,440
She might have thought it was chicken.

3092
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,280
There's a little bit of an affinity for chicken.

3093
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:23,280
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3094
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,640
It could just be like chicken.

3095
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:25,820
Oh, look, there's Pico!

3096
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:26,360
Oh!

3097
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:27,660
We can eat it too.

3098
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:28,340
Wait, where'd it go?

3099
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:29,300
Wait, where'd it...

3100
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:32,380
Oh, I got it through the fucking cabinet.

3101
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:36,840
Oh, there's three Picos.

3102
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:40,180
And a sexy bust.

3103
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:41,680
Hello.

3104
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:45,680
Why are these...

3105
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:46,320
Whoa.

3106
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:49,260
Are you okay, Lucy?

3107
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:51,380
I don't think so.

3108
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:54,500
Lucy, do I need to take you to a doctor?

3109
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:56,420
Chicken jockey!

3110
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:01,420
You know there's a Minecraft live event?

3111
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:03,360
A Minecraft...

3112
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:07,440
That's based off the movie and if you finish it, you get a special Minecraft movie cape.

3113
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:09,860
Wait, you didn't hear about it?

3114
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,260
A cape?

3115
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:13,280
Yeah, it ends on April 14th.

3116
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:15,240
Or maybe...

3117
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,840
I heard they extended it, but I don't know when it actually ends.

3118
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,240
I'm gonna look it up.

3119
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,300
Oh, hey.

3120
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:21,300
Oh, look, it's her!

3121
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:21,860
Hello!

3122
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:22,820
Oh no, it's the friend!

3123
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,720
It's her best friend, remember?

3124
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:28,440
Oh yeah, oh!

3125
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:29,140
Snapshot!

3126
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,860
Oh damn, they're smart.

3127
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:33,900
She's like, that's my best friend!

3128
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:37,140
Is that the end of the chapter?

3129
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:38,620
I don't think so.

3130
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:39,540
I'm just hurt.

3131
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:40,460
Oh, he's moaning.

3132
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:41,840
Hello!

3133
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:44,540
Minecraft.

3134
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:44,880
Minecraft.

3135
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,120
Oh.

3136
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:51,580
I got a jaw.

3137
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:52,820
Oh, you got a little chin.

3138
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:53,580
Yeah, oh, a jaw.

3139
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:55,060
What do I do with this?

3140
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:00,700
Good question.

3141
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:03,000
Why the fuck did she take all the light covers?

3142
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:04,740
Like, what am I gonna do?

3143
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,860
I think she's coming.

3144
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,860
What the hell was that?

3145
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:13,580
What was that?

3146
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:16,660
Um...

3147
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:18,700
Just some paranormal activity.

3148
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:20,200
Freaked out.

3149
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,800
Oh, people are telling you to save, maybe.

3150
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:23,980
What the fuck was that?

3151
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,460
I feel like it probably auto-saved, though, guys.

3152
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,840
Yeah, I'm pretty much pretty sure.

3153
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,920
I'm cat word right now, I'm not okay.

3154
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:33,540
Minecraft movie.

3155
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:41,650
How to get the Minecraft movie event cape.

3156
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:46,910
The yarn cape.

3157
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:50,670
Oh, it's this event, though.

3158
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:50,990
Yeah.

3159
02:00:51,070 --> 02:00:52,290
It's basically Overwatch.

3160
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:53,690
Wait, is it?

3161
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:54,950
I don't know what it is.

3162
02:00:54,950 --> 02:00:55,730
It seems fun.

3163
02:00:56,490 --> 02:00:56,790
Is it?

3164
02:00:56,870 --> 02:00:57,990
Wait, um...

3165
02:00:57,990 --> 02:01:00,550
Isn't there a mode in Overwatch where you have to, like, protect the payload?

3166
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:02,210
Oh, wait, is it actually just that?

3167
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:04,950
I heard there's, like, three different events, but you get to meet Steve!

3168
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:07,730
Oh, boy.

3169
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:11,290
Oh, boy.

3170
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:14,530
Wait, but we're missing a mannequin that's missing his jaw?

3171
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:16,250
Guys, you think I remember that?

3172
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:17,490
Wait, this door opened.

3173
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:19,830
I don't even remember seeing a mannequin ever.

3174
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:20,550
Me too.

3175
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:21,770
Wait, I'm in the kitchen now.

3176
02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:27,390
I have not been paying attention.

3177
02:01:27,570 --> 02:01:29,230
Oh, I accidentally took my meds.

3178
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:30,410
That was not the right item.

3179
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:30,870
Oopsie.

3180
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:32,430
Well, it's dark.

3181
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:33,450
It's probably fine.

3182
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:36,330
Wasn't it in the basement?

3183
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:36,850
Was it?

3184
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,330
That would make sense, no?

3185
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:40,210
Yeah, but this door opened, though.

3186
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:42,910
That didn't...

3187
02:01:42,910 --> 02:01:43,190
Oh.

3188
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:44,890
Oh, it's on the other side.

3189
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:45,110
For the kitchen.

3190
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:48,510
Did she take every light cover?

3191
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:52,510
Every single one around this house.

3192
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:53,930
Like, Lucia.

3193
02:01:54,510 --> 02:01:55,470
Lucia's evil.

3194
02:01:58,750 --> 02:01:59,430
Lucia.

3195
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:02,170
This is why we shouldn't have homeschooled her.

3196
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:05,690
Wait, how tall is she?

3197
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:06,530
We can take her.

3198
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:07,910
Check the...

3199
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:08,530
What the hell?

3200
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:10,670
It, like, ricocheted me above.

3201
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:14,450
You're really excited about this.

3202
02:02:15,150 --> 02:02:19,110
Like, all I'm saying is that if we put her in a...

3203
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:20,210
Oh my god, that was my pills.

3204
02:02:20,410 --> 02:02:20,990
If we put her in...

3205
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:22,010
Oh, it scared me, too.

3206
02:02:24,190 --> 02:02:26,910
All I'm saying is that Chisha went to...

3207
02:02:26,910 --> 02:02:29,510
Went to a normal school instead of being homeschooled.

3208
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:31,570
Then she wouldn't be a freak right now.

3209
02:02:31,650 --> 02:02:32,490
No, I think...

3210
02:02:32,490 --> 02:02:35,430
I think it's literally this house that she grew up in.

3211
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:37,230
This is, like, whoever...

3212
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:38,230
I actually took my pills again.

3213
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:39,830
I took my last pills.

3214
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:42,550
Okay.

3215
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:45,330
I can't.

3216
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:48,250
Put them away.

3217
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:49,150
You're addicted.

3218
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:53,610
I have a problem.

3219
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:56,470
I have all these light bulbs.

3220
02:02:57,330 --> 02:02:58,990
But, like, I have all these...

3221
02:02:58,990 --> 02:03:00,510
We can't turn on any of them.

3222
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:02,710
I can't turn on anything.

3223
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:04,290
Wait, check the fridge.

3224
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:04,910
Check the fridge.

3225
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,470
It's on.

3226
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:11,250
This is not okay, Lucy.

3227
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:13,190
This looks like Homer Simpson's fridge.

3228
02:03:14,370 --> 02:03:17,470
Lucy, I am not happy right now.

3229
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:21,930
Lucy, daddy can't even crack a cold one.

3230
02:03:22,210 --> 02:03:22,610
Yeah.

3231
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:30,290
Oh, wait.

3232
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:31,750
Can you use that again?

3233
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:32,630
You can.

3234
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:33,990
I would take it.

3235
02:03:35,870 --> 02:03:36,870
Okay, nevermind.

3236
02:03:37,090 --> 02:03:38,090
Yeah, nevermind.

3237
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:39,110
I got too lazy.

3238
02:03:39,730 --> 02:03:40,650
We're looking for the... Wait!

3239
02:03:40,970 --> 02:03:43,290
Remember the sexy bust behind the light?

3240
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:45,090
What?

3241
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:45,750
There, there.

3242
02:03:45,790 --> 02:03:46,190
In that room.

3243
02:03:46,270 --> 02:03:46,750
In that room.

3244
02:03:47,470 --> 02:03:49,290
See, this is why I have you around.

3245
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:51,510
You went the wrong way, though.

3246
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:53,410
You said that room.

3247
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:56,210
The one with the light.

3248
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:56,970
The light.

3249
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:57,830
That one.

3250
02:03:57,930 --> 02:03:58,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3251
02:03:58,590 --> 02:03:59,450
In there, in there, in there.

3252
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:04,210
See?

3253
02:04:04,830 --> 02:04:05,730
There was a sexy...

3254
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:07,130
I'll never forget a sexy body.

3255
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:09,530
Yeah, but it has to be missing a jaw.

3256
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:12,010
It is missing its head.

3257
02:04:12,010 --> 02:04:12,730
Oh, see?

3258
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:13,270
Oh, wait.

3259
02:04:16,630 --> 02:04:18,210
We got the jaw.

3260
02:04:18,430 --> 02:04:19,390
We got the jaw.

3261
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:20,550
It's not here.

3262
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:23,930
It's gone now.

3263
02:04:25,050 --> 02:04:26,030
Guys, I'm standing in the dark.

3264
02:04:26,110 --> 02:04:26,710
That's not good.

3265
02:04:28,810 --> 02:04:29,810
I hear rats.

3266
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:33,150
Nah, it's just termites.

3267
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:35,190
I hear termites.

3268
02:04:37,130 --> 02:04:38,010
That's definitely...

3269
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,430
What is that?

3270
02:04:39,470 --> 02:04:45,070
What is that one mansion that's in California that the lady built because she was trying to run from her demons?

3271
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:47,030
Oh my...

3272
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:47,910
Oh, you have...

3273
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:48,990
Yeah, you have the basement.

3274
02:04:49,630 --> 02:04:52,470
This must be the other door that you could not unlock earlier.

3275
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:52,830
Oh.

3276
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:53,990
Oh, it's not.

3277
02:04:54,050 --> 02:04:54,670
No, it's here.

3278
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:57,050
Yeah, the Winchester house.

3279
02:04:57,670 --> 02:04:58,870
The Winchester house?

3280
02:04:58,970 --> 02:04:59,610
What is that?

3281
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:01,090
It's literally...

3282
02:05:01,090 --> 02:05:02,130
Oh, my lighter is nearly empty.

3283
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:03,290
Oh, that's not good.

3284
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:04,170
That's not good.

3285
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:05,190
That's not good.

3286
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:05,810
That's not good.

3287
02:05:05,950 --> 02:05:06,410
That's not good.

3288
02:05:06,530 --> 02:05:07,610
Oh, that's not good.

3289
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:09,190
Oh, that's not good.

3290
02:05:09,310 --> 02:05:10,170
That's not good.

3291
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:10,910
It's bugged out.

3292
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:13,370
Yeah, it's bugged out.

3293
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:14,070
Don't worry about it then.

3294
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:16,330
Basically, the Winchester house...

3295
02:05:16,330 --> 02:05:18,170
So, this lady was like...

3296
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:21,790
She can't be in front of me, right?

3297
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:25,490
Right, guys?

3298
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:27,850
Go to the light in here, maybe.

3299
02:05:29,690 --> 02:05:30,950
Guys, my lighter is empty.

3300
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:38,870
Daddy's hungry.

3301
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:42,070
That's daddy's daddy.

3302
02:05:43,570 --> 02:05:44,970
Continue the story, Mint?

3303
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:45,250
Okay.

3304
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:50,730
So, she was like either the daughter or some descendant of a gun maker.

3305
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:51,550
What?

3306
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:56,390
Because of that, she felt a lot of guilt because the guns were used to kill people.

3307
02:05:56,950 --> 02:06:00,930
And so, she thought that she was being haunted by these demons.

3308
02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:03,530
And so, she built this house.

3309
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:04,670
And it's like nonsensical.

3310
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:06,670
There's stairs that lead to nowhere.

3311
02:06:06,670 --> 02:06:06,830
Oh, yeah.

3312
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:10,350
So, the ghosts won't lead towards her or some shit.

3313
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:11,250
She was the wife.

3314
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:11,770
Thank you.

3315
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:12,490
She was the wife.

3316
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:13,530
Okay, just kill me.

3317
02:06:13,610 --> 02:06:14,230
Just kill me.

3318
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:16,590
I'm going crazy.

3319
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:19,810
And I'll stand in this corner and you can do whatever you want.

3320
02:06:20,210 --> 02:06:23,370
What is this monster that's actually coming out?

3321
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:29,510
Oh, my sanity is not so good right now.

3322
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:31,110
I don't know.

3323
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:34,610
I don't know where the fucking thing is.

3324
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:36,250
I wanna see the monster.

3325
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:37,630
I wanna see what is happening.

3326
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:43,050
Where is it?

3327
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:44,750
Where is the mannequin?

3328
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:48,310
Where is the sexy jawless mannequin?

3329
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:50,870
I'll stand here.

3330
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:52,770
She's got a sexy jawline.

3331
02:06:57,450 --> 02:06:59,130
I'm crazy right now.

3332
02:06:59,170 --> 02:07:00,470
I have no pills.

3333
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:01,630
You walked past it.

3334
02:07:01,670 --> 02:07:03,750
Was it the one at the light before?

3335
02:07:05,090 --> 02:07:06,470
Because I saw one there.

3336
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:07,150
Was it there?

3337
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:07,790
That one?

3338
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:10,450
You didn't put the jaw on it.

3339
02:07:10,570 --> 02:07:12,270
Oh, it was that one?

3340
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:16,830
Only pills will keep you.

3341
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:20,230
Okay, kill me now so I can restart my journey.

3342
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:23,790
Yeah, I think that would be smarter.

3343
02:07:24,490 --> 02:07:26,850
I wanna see whatever it is.

3344
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:27,290
Yeah, I know.

3345
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:28,130
I'm just sitting here.

3346
02:07:28,130 --> 02:07:29,330
Is it not gonna hunt me?

3347
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:33,870
Wait, is that a lighter?

3348
02:07:35,210 --> 02:07:35,950
No way.

3349
02:07:36,170 --> 02:07:40,350
At least I know where the lighter is.

3350
02:07:42,410 --> 02:07:44,870
At least I know it's there.

3351
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:48,810
This game is actually pretty generous.

3352
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:52,170
Stop flashing.

3353
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:53,870
Stop flashing it, Doki.

3354
02:07:53,870 --> 02:07:55,210
I didn't know that.

3355
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:57,230
Oh my god.

3356
02:07:57,610 --> 02:07:58,970
Jesus Christ.

3357
02:07:59,210 --> 02:08:01,090
It was like right behind you.

3358
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:02,190
It came from the wall.

3359
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:09,190
I was like, if I stand in this corner, at least I know it's approaching me.

3360
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:15,790
It's right behind me, isn't it?

3361
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:18,030
She's right behind me.

3362
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:18,690
What?

3363
02:08:18,970 --> 02:08:22,550
That thing does not sound like or look like it should be making that noise.

3364
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,910
It teleports behind you.

3365
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:27,950
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

3366
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:28,570
I'll be right back.

3367
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:36,040
She's asleep.

3368
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:39,120
There she goes.

3369
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,600
There she goes.

3370
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,160
How much more?

3371
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:46,600
Do we have to find the head too?

3372
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:50,720
For this mannequin?

3373
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:53,800
Are you spooked?

3374
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:58,920
Give us more ideas for what?

3375
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,500
What do you mean more ideas?

3376
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:03,280
What do you mean?

3377
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,300
Hi Minto.

3378
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:12,330
Let's all smack talk.

3379
02:09:13,910 --> 02:09:18,130
You're all... Wait, I was gonna say all bark and no bite, but she's a cat.

3380
02:09:20,030 --> 02:09:22,210
You're all bark and no bite.

3381
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:23,910
Did they give up?

3382
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:24,290
No!

3383
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:27,330
Doki is going to the bathroom.

3384
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:29,810
I'm here.

3385
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:33,010
I bought some banana bread earlier.

3386
02:09:33,170 --> 02:09:34,330
I kind of want to eat that.

3387
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:36,210
I kind of want to go get that.

3388
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:38,670
Banana bread.

3389
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:41,930
Banana bread.

3390
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:50,150
Solid snake.

3391
02:09:52,970 --> 02:09:54,310
Get it with butter?

3392
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:57,110
I've never had banana bread with butter.

3393
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:01,850
You're all meow and no scratch.

3394
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:02,470
Exactly.

3395
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:19,160
She's... Oh wait.

3396
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,480
She's rebooting.

3397
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:23,580
What's life changing?

3398
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:26,320
People in my chat was like, it's life changing.

3399
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,720
You gotta try it with butter.

3400
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:32,720
I told them I got banana bread earlier and they said try it with butter.

3401
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:33,540
Wait, what?

3402
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:33,980
Really?

3403
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:36,160
I thought you can just eat banana bread on it's own.

3404
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:38,300
I've always just had it on it's own.

3405
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:40,560
And I'm really red right now.

3406
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:48,000
Oh wait, you just broke the seal.

3407
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:50,100
I broke the what?

3408
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:51,480
The seal.

3409
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:52,240
What's the seal?

3410
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:58,400
When you drink and then you go to the bathroom for the first time, now you're gonna have to go to the bathroom every two seconds.

3411
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:59,460
Oh, that's true.

3412
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:00,920
That's gonna be me.

3413
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,640
Wait, did someone take a bite out of my pizza?

3414
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:03,620
No, okay, no, I didn't.

3415
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:05,280
It was just baked wrong.

3416
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:09,500
Who else would be taking a bite out of your pizza?

3417
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:12,400
Lucy?

3418
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:15,740
Lucy, did you take a bite out of daddy's special pizza?

3419
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:23,560
Lucy, that pizza was laced with daddy's special medicine.

3420
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:27,080
Lucy, you shouldn't have done that.

3421
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:37,920
I almost said special sauce, but I think that was not gonna be very good.

3422
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:44,160
No, no, no, no.

3423
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:46,700
He's like, I want pizza too.

3424
02:11:46,980 --> 02:11:49,780
He's not getting pizza, it's my pizza.

3425
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:52,860
Give him what he wants.

3426
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:59,840
The dad craves pizza.

3427
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:02,580
He won't stop pizza.

3428
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:07,840
Okay, while you eat your pizza, I'm gonna go get banana bread.

3429
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:11,860
I don't have any butter left.

3430
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:14,200
Uber, eat some butter right now.

3431
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:24,480
Just one stick of butter, like the guy comes in just to buy you a stick of butter.

3432
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:28,080
It's just a single stick of butter at my door.

3433
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:36,940
And then the fees are high, like the Uber fees are higher than the stick of butter.

3434
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:39,040
It's like a ten dollar stick of butter.

3435
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:44,480
But they said, Chad said it'll change your world though.

3436
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:47,740
Actually, oh wait, I lied a little bit.

3437
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:51,220
I do have butter, but it's because I accidentally bought salted butter.

3438
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,820
And I haven't been using it.

3439
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:55,540
What's the difference?

3440
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:58,760
What is salted?

3441
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:04,740
You salted?

3442
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:05,860
Salted is fine?

3443
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:07,360
Is it really?

3444
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:10,100
But it's a little saltier.

3445
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:14,120
I don't want salty banana bread.

3446
02:13:15,180 --> 02:13:16,360
Sweet and salty?

3447
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:17,980
That'd be okay.

3448
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:19,760
Might be good.

3449
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:21,220
Okay, I'm gonna go try it.

3450
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:22,700
Alright, I'll eat my pizza.

3451
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:25,640
Yeah, a little break, a little break.

3452
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:26,600
Food break, guys.

3453
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:27,540
Food break.

3454
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:29,240
Oh, we were gonna go deliver the bust.

3455
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,640
Yeah, the sexy jaw for the sexy lady.

3456
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:36,400
And I'll still have my medicine too.

3457
02:13:41,410 --> 02:13:46,230
Hey guys, I'm not looking forward to do Drunk Marble Rivals later.

3458
02:13:49,910 --> 02:13:53,710
I literally just need two and a half hours.

3459
02:13:53,710 --> 02:13:55,270
That's all I need.

3460
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:00,550
I'm not.

3461
02:14:01,310 --> 02:14:05,930
I was really so depressed earlier this morning because I didn't make it.

3462
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:13,230
Oh yeah, for those who don't know, I was drinking soju the entire time.

3463
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:17,590
I was just like sipping out of the soju bottle.

3464
02:14:18,830 --> 02:14:22,610
So yeah, I'm just gonna be reminded the last two and a half hours.

3465
02:14:22,610 --> 02:14:24,910
I'm just gonna be reminded of what I couldn't get.

3466
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:28,910
At least I'm drinking to forget that pain.

3467
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:30,130
Just do Quickplay.

3468
02:14:30,350 --> 02:14:31,770
Quickplay's not fun, though.

3469
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:33,930
Actually, no, I'll be griefing Eternity Games.

3470
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:39,290
Because I was gonna be like, I was gonna play while drunk in Eternity Games.

3471
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:43,670
And all these people are still trying their hardest to make it to Top 500.

3472
02:14:43,670 --> 02:14:49,430
And I'll just be like, it's just literally, I will be the fucking make it or break it.

3473
02:14:58,710 --> 02:15:00,610
I'm actually gonna be the Elo terrorist.

3474
02:15:01,070 --> 02:15:02,230
Okay, maybe I'm too.

3475
02:15:02,870 --> 02:15:04,670
Because it's gonna be like...

3476
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:08,090
I want them all to feel the pain.

3477
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:09,050
I'm not making it.

3478
02:15:14,570 --> 02:15:16,050
A true joker.

3479
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:21,950
I'm gonna have so many people hate me.

3480
02:15:22,550 --> 02:15:27,050
No, I was...

3481
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:30,930
I was an Elo terrorist sometimes.

3482
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:33,410
Because then, like, at one point I got into a Doom queue.

3483
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:37,090
I got into a Doom queue in, like, Austria.

3484
02:15:38,170 --> 02:15:39,890
And it got, like, solo queued.

3485
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:41,670
And I was actually an Elo terrorist.

3486
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:49,890
Oh my god.

3487
02:15:50,930 --> 02:15:51,870
Oh my god.

3488
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:52,170
Um, okay.

3489
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:54,390
No, it went really bad.

3490
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:55,770
I, like, lost, like, five games.

3491
02:15:55,890 --> 02:15:57,130
I lost, like, six games in a row.

3492
02:15:57,250 --> 02:15:58,090
It was that bad.

3493
02:15:58,410 --> 02:15:59,110
No, even more.

3494
02:15:59,170 --> 02:15:59,730
Maybe it was more.

3495
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:00,590
It was definitely more.

3496
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:03,370
I lost a lot of games in a row.

3497
02:16:04,230 --> 02:16:13,010
I, at one point, I dropped from, like, um, 350 all the way to 120.

3498
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:14,990
And then I got it back the next day.

3499
02:16:15,190 --> 02:16:17,530
I, I, I, that was how bad it was.

3500
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:20,270
At one point, like, this week in general.

3501
02:16:20,570 --> 02:16:21,790
I don't remember what day it was.

3502
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:22,770
It all blurred together.

3503
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:25,410
Um, and then I got it back the next day.

3504
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:26,790
But, like, it...

3505
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:38,950
It got so bad, I left VC and I muted chat.

3506
02:16:39,470 --> 02:16:42,930
Cause I know what, what, I know what mental state I was in.

3507
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:48,770
I knew I was at where I was at mentally.

3508
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:51,270
So I had to leave.

3509
02:16:51,690 --> 02:16:55,830
I was like, I don't want them to see me like this.

3510
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:01,730
I don't want them to know.

3511
02:17:03,630 --> 02:17:04,590
Oh my god.

3512
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:06,410
And then, like, at one point.

3513
02:17:06,410 --> 02:17:07,510
I'm back.

3514
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:08,510
Oh, welcome back.

3515
02:17:08,730 --> 02:17:09,890
Welcome back to us.

3516
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:10,210
I also got pizza.

3517
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:11,970
Oh, you got cold pizza too?

3518
02:17:12,690 --> 02:17:13,970
Yeah, the one I made last night.

3519
02:17:14,190 --> 02:17:15,850
Oh, the really burnt one?

3520
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:17,250
Yep.

3521
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:18,890
Don't you, like...

3522
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:20,410
Isn't that bad for your health?

3523
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:32,410
Don't people say that if you eat, like, burnt food, it raises the likelihood...

3524
02:17:33,810 --> 02:17:34,510
Of what?

3525
02:17:36,610 --> 02:17:37,570
Of, like...

3526
02:17:37,570 --> 02:17:38,710
Getting, like...

3527
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:39,490
Wait, what is it?

3528
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:43,470
Why did she burnt her pizza and she's eating burnt pizza?

3529
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:47,230
Yeah, it's like...

3530
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:48,030
It's not that burnt.

3531
02:17:49,370 --> 02:17:50,270
Bro, the picture.

3532
02:17:52,210 --> 02:17:53,270
Oh, that's a myth?

3533
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:55,050
Oh my god, my mom lied to me?

3534
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,650
Oh my...

3535
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:07,750
Oh, burnt food is a carcinogen.

3536
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:09,890
Did you not know that?

3537
02:18:12,830 --> 02:18:14,170
It's not that burnt.

3538
02:18:14,890 --> 02:18:15,430
Oh, yeah.

3539
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:17,590
Wait, no, but the picture shows...

3540
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:19,530
How is it any different from when it was normally cooked?

3541
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:21,890
It looks really...

3542
02:18:21,890 --> 02:18:22,870
It's crunchy!

3543
02:18:23,130 --> 02:18:24,410
What do you mean?

3544
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:26,990
Pizza's not supposed to be that crunchy.

3545
02:18:27,790 --> 02:18:28,930
It tastes like a cookie.

3546
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:33,350
Hey, you want some pizza crust, Dad?

3547
02:18:33,630 --> 02:18:34,830
I gave him a pizza crust.

3548
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:39,270
Yeah, I don't like crust that much, so he gets scraps.

3549
02:18:40,590 --> 02:18:41,850
Why is it crunchy?

3550
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:45,150
Why is it...

3551
02:18:45,150 --> 02:18:51,010
Why is it crunchy?

3552
02:18:51,330 --> 02:18:52,470
It's actually kind of good.

3553
02:18:55,270 --> 02:18:57,990
Also, chat, I need to know, like...

3554
02:18:57,990 --> 02:18:59,130
How far are we?

3555
02:19:00,710 --> 02:19:01,810
Oh yeah, I was wondering that too.

3556
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:04,810
How...

3557
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:05,410
How far are we?

3558
02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:08,030
Where are we at?

3559
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:09,930
At this point?

3560
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:15,430
Okay, no, I know, people.

3561
02:19:15,590 --> 02:19:16,310
There's no way.

3562
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:17,790
There's no way, like...

3563
02:19:17,790 --> 02:19:19,990
There's no way, like, we're 15%.

3564
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:21,290
This feels so much...

3565
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:24,030
I feel like we made up so much progress.

3566
02:19:24,590 --> 02:19:25,990
Almost through the tutorial.

3567
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:28,430
20%?

3568
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:31,510
We're only 20%?

3569
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:33,470
I don't have food!

3570
02:19:33,470 --> 02:19:35,770
Do they mean of the chapter or of the game?

3571
02:19:36,150 --> 02:19:37,690
Oh no, I meant this chapter, guys.

3572
02:19:37,770 --> 02:19:39,030
I meant this chapter.

3573
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:40,490
How far are we on?

3574
02:19:40,650 --> 02:19:41,910
Guys, I will...

3575
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:45,770
I will progress the game when I know how much left.

3576
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:46,930
Oh, 80%.

3577
02:19:46,930 --> 02:19:48,370
Okay, we're so close.

3578
02:19:48,470 --> 02:19:48,730
Okay.

3579
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:50,670
Okay.

3580
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:53,090
Thanks, guys.

3581
02:19:53,750 --> 02:19:55,430
Okay, we're at 80%.

3582
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:57,150
So, okay.

3583
02:19:57,850 --> 02:19:59,150
Wait, we're not even half...

3584
02:19:59,150 --> 02:20:00,370
Okay, guys, now you're...

3585
02:20:03,470 --> 02:20:06,690
I think it's just, like, ambience when we're taking too long.

3586
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:07,430
Right?

3587
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:14,230
That's just ambience.

3588
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:18,090
Oh, you want some pizza?

3589
02:20:19,290 --> 02:20:19,690
Oh, yeah?

3590
02:20:20,130 --> 02:20:21,250
Give me that crunch.

3591
02:20:22,210 --> 02:20:23,330
What the fuck is that?

3592
02:20:23,370 --> 02:20:24,170
Is that your pizza?

3593
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:25,590
Yeah.

3594
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:27,010
That was like cold pasta.

3595
02:20:27,250 --> 02:20:30,070
I'm not gonna waste it.

3596
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:31,470
Okay.

3597
02:20:31,470 --> 02:20:35,290
How depressing would it be if I ate cold pasta as well?

3598
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:40,870
Do not eat cold pasta.

3599
02:20:43,770 --> 02:20:44,990
No, she made it herself.

3600
02:20:45,150 --> 02:20:46,470
She made the pizza herself.

3601
02:20:47,770 --> 02:20:49,370
Yeah, it is really crunchy, though.

3602
02:20:49,770 --> 02:20:50,310
It is.

3603
02:20:50,530 --> 02:20:52,490
That is depression food right there.

3604
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:53,850
What are you depressed about?

3605
02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:59,890
I told Chow what I'm depressed about.

3606
02:20:59,890 --> 02:21:02,050
What are you depressed about right now?

3607
02:21:02,130 --> 02:21:02,330
Oh, what?

3608
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:03,890
You're, uh...

3609
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:05,910
Marvel Rivals.

3610
02:21:05,970 --> 02:21:06,790
I almost said Overwatch.

3611
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:11,050
Marvel Rivals.

3612
02:21:11,070 --> 02:21:12,370
My Marvel Rivals.

3613
02:21:13,150 --> 02:21:14,790
Yeah, we're taking a break right now.

3614
02:21:14,990 --> 02:21:16,130
I'm depressed about burning my pizza.

3615
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:18,890
Just the little things.

3616
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:20,610
Why are you eating it?

3617
02:21:21,370 --> 02:21:23,230
Because I'm not gonna waste it.

3618
02:21:23,290 --> 02:21:24,350
It was a whole pizza.

3619
02:21:24,410 --> 02:21:25,550
Just give it to your cat.

3620
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:27,330
What?

3621
02:21:27,970 --> 02:21:28,890
Do cats eat pizza?

3622
02:21:29,370 --> 02:21:31,130
I'd just give it to my dog.

3623
02:21:32,310 --> 02:21:34,390
You would feed this to your dog.

3624
02:21:34,530 --> 02:21:35,750
Do you love your dog?

3625
02:21:36,810 --> 02:21:38,790
You literally said it was alright.

3626
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:40,570
You're like, mmm, it's so good.

3627
02:21:41,130 --> 02:21:42,510
I have a funny taste.

3628
02:21:43,330 --> 02:21:45,090
Yeah, but your cat's funny, isn't he?

3629
02:21:46,030 --> 02:21:47,530
I don't think he would like this.

3630
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:52,130
Isn't he a silly little boy?

3631
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:56,110
Yeah, but like, he's not a stupid little boy.

3632
02:21:59,070 --> 02:22:00,890
Wait, I thought like...

3633
02:22:01,930 --> 02:22:05,510
Didn't you say one of your cats is like...

3634
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:06,070
Special?

3635
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:08,390
Yeah, he is.

3636
02:22:08,470 --> 02:22:08,870
He's inbred.

3637
02:22:09,070 --> 02:22:09,830
Yeah, he's inbred.

3638
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:10,350
Yeah.

3639
02:22:10,990 --> 02:22:13,430
So like, is he like...

3640
02:22:13,430 --> 02:22:14,250
What are you trying to say?

3641
02:22:19,890 --> 02:22:22,450
What type of inbred is he?

3642
02:22:22,450 --> 02:22:24,450
Is he like...

3643
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:27,750
You know...

3644
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:30,710
He's...

3645
02:22:30,710 --> 02:22:32,310
Wait, how is it rude?

3646
02:22:32,490 --> 02:22:35,010
Is he like...

3647
02:22:35,010 --> 02:22:37,590
What do you mean, what type of inbred?

3648
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:39,630
Like, that's why it's like...

3649
02:22:39,630 --> 02:22:41,690
There's different like...

3650
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:43,670
Traits of...

3651
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:46,730
Like when I hear inbred, I just think about the Egyptians.

3652
02:22:47,530 --> 02:22:49,270
And like how you know like...

3653
02:22:49,270 --> 02:22:51,290
How like...

3654
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:52,310
What was his name?

3655
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:52,890
King Tut?

3656
02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:55,350
Was so inbred that like...

3657
02:22:56,390 --> 02:22:58,570
What was that expression?

3658
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:02,870
Was it King Tut?

3659
02:23:03,050 --> 02:23:04,630
I know there was like that one...

3660
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:06,990
It wasn't the Romanovs.

3661
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:09,390
But it was like one like...

3662
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:10,390
European family.

3663
02:23:10,730 --> 02:23:11,750
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3664
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:12,670
And then like...

3665
02:23:12,670 --> 02:23:15,290
One of the kings or whatever only lives...

3666
02:23:16,210 --> 02:23:16,770
The...

3667
02:23:17,290 --> 02:23:17,690
Habsburg.

3668
02:23:17,690 --> 02:23:18,730
Yeah, the Habsburg.

3669
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:20,670
Where he like basically has...

3670
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:22,810
His family was so inbred.

3671
02:23:23,290 --> 02:23:24,770
That like he was born...

3672
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:26,550
He was born...

3673
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:29,030
And when he was born, he was born blue apparently.

3674
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:30,790
Because he wasn't breathing or some shit.

3675
02:23:30,850 --> 02:23:32,810
And then they brought him back to life or something.

3676
02:23:33,470 --> 02:23:35,150
And then like...

3677
02:23:35,150 --> 02:23:36,170
Oh, it's Habsburg.

3678
02:23:36,450 --> 02:23:37,150
Or Habsburg.

3679
02:23:39,470 --> 02:23:41,210
And then like he had like...

3680
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:43,030
The really freaky chin and everything.

3681
02:23:44,090 --> 02:23:44,570
And...

3682
02:23:45,430 --> 02:23:46,490
It was basically...

3683
02:23:46,490 --> 02:23:48,770
Yeah, his family tree was basically like...

3684
02:23:48,770 --> 02:23:49,410
A circle.

3685
02:23:50,230 --> 02:23:52,330
Yeah, the Egyptians were worse too.

3686
02:23:52,990 --> 02:23:53,930
They were so inbred.

3687
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:55,890
I'm gonna look up...

3688
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:56,930
King Tut inbreeding.

3689
02:23:56,930 --> 02:23:59,490
Yeah, King Tut's parents were brother and sister.

3690
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:02,630
No way.

3691
02:24:02,750 --> 02:24:03,090
Yeah.

3692
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:06,050
How is he the most famous Egyptian king?

3693
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:08,110
Like...

3694
02:24:08,110 --> 02:24:09,290
Yeah, I remember King Tut...

3695
02:24:09,290 --> 02:24:12,590
I think it's because...

3696
02:24:12,590 --> 02:24:14,270
You know, like his...

3697
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:15,450
Sarcophagus.

3698
02:24:16,450 --> 02:24:18,470
It's like the one of the most famous ones.

3699
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:20,270
Oh yeah, because it's the one that's like...

3700
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:21,830
Not as damaged or some shit.

3701
02:24:21,990 --> 02:24:24,310
So it's like preserved really well.

3702
02:24:24,330 --> 02:24:24,870
Yeah, his tomb was preserved.

3703
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:27,250
Yeah, it was preserved really well.

3704
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:28,870
Oh, a fully intact tomb.

3705
02:24:29,010 --> 02:24:30,150
Oh yeah, okay, I remember.

3706
02:24:30,690 --> 02:24:34,430
Can you imagine like he's the absolute shitty...

3707
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:36,010
Like nobody liked this guy.

3708
02:24:36,250 --> 02:24:38,250
And everybody only remembers him.

3709
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:39,830
Because it's...

3710
02:24:39,830 --> 02:24:41,530
That's why it was so intact.

3711
02:24:41,630 --> 02:24:44,430
No one wanted to rob his tomb.

3712
02:24:45,770 --> 02:24:48,070
Was it King Tut that they like...

3713
02:24:48,070 --> 02:24:49,710
Got the vocal cord sample of?

3714
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:51,890
And they were like, this is what he might have sound like.

3715
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:52,690
And it was just...

3716
02:24:55,150 --> 02:24:58,510
They were like, this is what King Tut might have sound like.

3717
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:03,290
Hold on, I'm gonna send this to you.

3718
02:25:03,290 --> 02:25:03,870
Wrong!

3719
02:25:07,210 --> 02:25:08,390
Oh, here we go, here we go.

3720
02:25:09,370 --> 02:25:11,470
Wait, hold on, let me make sure this is...

3721
02:25:11,470 --> 02:25:12,370
Oh, I see that.

3722
02:25:12,650 --> 02:25:13,550
Oh, it wasn't him.

3723
02:25:14,690 --> 02:25:15,150
Hold on.

3724
02:25:18,530 --> 02:25:19,130
Hold on.

3725
02:25:20,510 --> 02:25:21,830
Yeah, okay, this is it.

3726
02:25:25,010 --> 02:25:26,390
It's so funny.

3727
02:25:27,070 --> 02:25:27,870
What is this?

3728
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:30,690
What is this?

3729
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:37,470
Oh, I'll show you.

3730
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:38,370
I'll link the video.

3731
02:25:38,610 --> 02:25:40,950
With a 3D printer!

3732
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:41,890
Yeah!

3733
02:25:50,610 --> 02:25:54,050
It allowed them to produce a single sound.

3734
02:25:58,270 --> 02:25:59,450
This is so funny.

3735
02:26:06,930 --> 02:26:08,750
That's so silly.

3736
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:12,850
Okay.

3737
02:26:13,970 --> 02:26:15,290
Why is Team YouTube...

3738
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:17,170
DMing me on Twitter?

3739
02:26:17,370 --> 02:26:17,830
What?

3740
02:26:18,210 --> 02:26:19,370
Team YouTube?

3741
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:19,890
Oh!

3742
02:26:20,750 --> 02:26:22,630
Ms. Boxer!

3743
02:26:23,310 --> 02:26:23,950
What is it about?

3744
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:27,570
It says, please take a moment to complete our online survey.

3745
02:26:28,310 --> 02:26:30,710

3746

Yeah!

3747
02:26:32,430 --> 02:26:36,390
They DMed you on Twitter to complete a survey.

3748
02:26:37,010 --> 02:26:39,830
Wait, are you following YouTube's Twitter account?

3749
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:40,690
No!

3750
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:43,250
Wait, that's so weird.

3751
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:45,970
I think they got hacked.

3752
02:26:47,870 --> 02:26:49,410
Oh, don't click it.

3753
02:26:49,730 --> 02:26:52,550
Wait, they actually got hacked?

3754
02:26:53,970 --> 02:26:54,990
I don't know.

3755
02:26:55,070 --> 02:26:55,710
Here, I'll show you.

3756
02:26:56,650 --> 02:26:58,270
It's 100% them.

3757
02:26:58,790 --> 02:26:59,650
This is crazy.

3758
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:01,830
What the hell?

3759
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:11,210
Survey-prod8.sprinklr.com That...

3760
02:27:11,210 --> 02:27:12,690
This is sus as hell.

3761
02:27:13,390 --> 02:27:15,530
You guys should have said it out loud.

3762
02:27:16,130 --> 02:27:18,410
No, that's not the full link, you guys.

3763
02:27:18,450 --> 02:27:19,230
Don't worry.

3764
02:27:19,250 --> 02:27:19,970
That's not the full link, guys.

3765
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:24,470
It's actually slash index dot html.

3766
02:27:25,710 --> 02:27:27,470
Question mark ID.

3767
02:27:31,750 --> 02:27:32,630
It seems...

3768
02:27:34,410 --> 02:27:37,290
Wait, let me...

3769
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:39,190
I'm gonna ask them, are you hacked?

3770
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:41,230
I'm gonna see if anyone...

3771
02:27:41,230 --> 02:27:42,750
I'm gonna look up Team YouTube.

3772
02:27:43,070 --> 02:27:45,590
And see if anyone else got the...

3773
02:27:46,330 --> 02:27:47,210
That's weird.

3774
02:27:47,790 --> 02:27:49,110
Wait, no one else got it?

3775
02:27:51,850 --> 02:27:52,950
I'm the chosen one.

3776
02:27:53,050 --> 02:27:57,310
Everyone's just complaining about, like, at Team YouTube, my channel, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3777
02:27:57,370 --> 02:27:59,510
And then people are just being mad at Team YouTube.

3778
02:28:00,230 --> 02:28:00,970
Oh, yeah.

3779
02:28:01,410 --> 02:28:03,510
Yeah, I don't see anything mentioning about...

3780
02:28:04,870 --> 02:28:07,010
Mentioning about, like, the DM shit.

3781
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:09,250
Maybe you got...

3782
02:28:09,250 --> 02:28:10,530
Maybe you got chosen.

3783
02:28:11,490 --> 02:28:14,810
Maybe you should send this link to somebody else and be like, can you take this survey?

3784
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:18,970
I'm gonna put it in your chat.

3785
02:28:19,450 --> 02:28:21,070
It's like, oh, what is it called?

3786
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:23,190
You know how, like, people...

3787
02:28:23,190 --> 02:28:24,210
Oh my god, that's been so long.

3788
02:28:24,310 --> 02:28:25,530
I do, like, those email chains.

3789
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:27,550
I was like, you gotta send this to ten other people.

3790
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:29,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3791
02:28:29,410 --> 02:28:30,330
What are they called again?

3792
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:31,910
Oh my god, it's a chain mail email.

3793
02:28:32,050 --> 02:28:33,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, chain mail, chain mail.

3794
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:34,570
Yeah, chain mail.

3795
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:36,810
You send it to ten other people.

3796
02:28:37,050 --> 02:28:38,550
It's like, take this survey.

3797
02:28:39,170 --> 02:28:40,230
Or Lucy will come.

3798
02:28:42,130 --> 02:28:44,930
Or Lucy's gonna come out and get you.

3799
02:28:47,410 --> 02:28:47,850
Guys,

3800
02:28:52,010 --> 02:28:52,530
I'm not okay.

3801
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:54,190
I drank up...

3802
02:28:54,190 --> 02:28:57,110
I drank more than half a soju bottle right now.

3803
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:59,290
I can feel my face turning...

3804
02:28:59,290 --> 02:29:00,510
Like, feeling a little numb.

3805
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:01,890
This is not good.

3806
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:02,730
Should we continue the game?

3807
02:29:04,430 --> 02:29:05,410
Give me a sec.

3808
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:08,510
I need to hydrate real quick.

3809
02:29:12,250 --> 02:29:14,030
Okay, we gotta take the sexy jaw.

3810
02:29:15,250 --> 02:29:17,650
Okay, when was my last auto-save, guys?

3811
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:18,470
I don't remember.

3812
02:29:18,970 --> 02:29:20,230
I guess we'll find out.

3813
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:22,170
Probably once we kicked you out.

3814
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:24,170
Where is it?

3815
02:29:26,290 --> 02:29:27,370
Where is it?

3816
02:29:27,850 --> 02:29:29,170
Where is my little...

3817
02:29:29,170 --> 02:29:30,490
My little Lucy?

3818
02:29:31,770 --> 02:29:32,770
Little Lucy!

3819
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:34,790
Lucy, where are you?

3820
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:36,570
Where am I?

3821
02:29:38,070 --> 02:29:39,070
Lucy goosey.

3822
02:29:39,250 --> 02:29:40,470
Wait, is this where she kicked me out?

3823
02:29:41,370 --> 02:29:42,930
Oh yeah, it is.

3824
02:29:44,610 --> 02:29:45,390
Do you have the jaw?

3825
02:29:47,430 --> 02:29:49,670
Oh, you gotta get it from the sink, no?

3826
02:29:50,310 --> 02:29:51,170
What is this, a sink?

3827
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:54,630
Oh yeah, it is.

3828
02:29:57,940 --> 02:29:59,230
There's the sexy jaw.

3829
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:02,110
Sexy jaw, baby.

3830
02:30:07,900 --> 02:30:09,940
Why does it do that?

3831
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:14,560
Oh, was that the guy I saw that just disappeared?

3832
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:19,920
To the basement!

3833
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:21,460
To the basement!

3834
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:22,660
To the floor!

3835
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:26,880
Okay.

3836
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:29,920
Oh wait, that's...

3837
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:33,160
Don't accidentally take your pills.

3838
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:34,280
Okay.

3839
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:37,860
I'm gonna accidentally...

3840
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:42,520
Not the spam again.

3841
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:45,980
I would use your lighter here.

3842
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:47,640
I would too, you're right.

3843
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:48,700
Nah.

3844
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:50,740
Put away the pills.

3845
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:52,900
But I like my pills.

3846
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:58,440
I'm sure your pills like you too very much.

3847
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:08,760
Wait, that's the first time we've seen him.

3848
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:09,880
Like that.

3849
02:31:11,380 --> 02:31:13,040
Wait, wait, I think you can go that way.

3850
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:13,420
Oh yeah.

3851
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:19,540
My brain is getting more noticeable.

3852
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:22,260
You might want to take your pills.

3853
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:23,680
Okay!

3854
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:26,400
Hello, madam.

3855
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:27,680
Hello, madam.

3856
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:29,340
Oh, we got it!

3857
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:31,500
This mannequin wasn't here.

3858
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:33,420
Yes it was, you unobservant fuck!

3859
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:34,860
It was right behind her!

3860
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:37,100
I took the pill.

3861
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:40,320
To the floor.

3862
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:44,640
What's in here?

3863
02:31:49,190 --> 02:31:49,710
Oh!

3864
02:31:51,170 --> 02:31:52,070
Your lighter?

3865
02:31:52,390 --> 02:31:53,490
Oh, I actually took another pill.

3866
02:31:53,490 --> 02:31:53,710
Hello?

3867
02:32:00,970 --> 02:32:02,070
You're right.

3868
02:32:03,010 --> 02:32:04,050
Let me in!

3869
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:11,460
Not now!

3870
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:19,920
Okay, I didn't mean not now.

3871
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:20,800
I was just joking.

3872
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:22,800
I didn't...

3873
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:28,600
He was just listening to you.

3874
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:30,000
He was obliging you.

3875
02:32:31,060 --> 02:32:32,320
Okay, sure.

3876
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:33,400
Come right in.

3877
02:32:34,460 --> 02:32:36,140
Is that what you wanted?

3878
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:38,300
Wait, where are we?

3879
02:32:38,460 --> 02:32:39,440
Where are we?

3880
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:50,860
Okay.

3881
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:53,100
Okay.

3882
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:53,960
Okay.

3883
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,360
Why is this part lit up?

3884
02:32:58,520 --> 02:32:59,400
Okay, it goes up.

3885
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,520
Saving is disabled.

3886
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:07,320
Okay, Lucy, that was not fun.

3887
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:17,100
Lucy, when you take daddy's light covers...

3888
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:18,780
Like, what do you want me to do?

3889
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:20,240
Yeah, oh!

3890
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:22,280
Wait, gosh, there's so many...

3891
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:23,560
Wait, where the hell are we?

3892
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:24,960
Are we in the...

3893
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:25,840
What's it called?

3894
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:29,560
The Westenberg house now?

3895
02:33:30,320 --> 02:33:32,000
The Westenberg house?

3896
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:38,520
Yeah, we're in the Westenberg house, everybody.

3897
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:42,080
No, no radio.

3898
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,900
You've lost your TV privileges.

3899
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:45,720
Yeah, no...

3900
02:33:46,010 --> 02:33:48,060
No entertainment for you anymore, Lucy.

3901
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:50,000
Yeah, go to your room!

3902
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:52,060
Go to your room!

3903
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:53,960
You go...

3904
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:55,540
Oh, madam.

3905
02:33:58,020 --> 02:33:59,800
I'm not happy right now.

3906
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:04,080
Okay.

3907
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:06,180
She wants me.

3908
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:08,660
What's that?

3909
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:11,240
What does that mean?

3910
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:12,740
Doki, what does that mean?

3911
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:15,580
Doki, what does that mean?

3912
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:16,360
I don't know.

3913
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:18,140
I don't know.

3914
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:21,440
If I keep going forward, nothing bad will happen to me.

3915
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:22,120
Just keep going.

3916
02:34:22,740 --> 02:34:24,340
Yeah, someone said do not stop.

3917
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:24,640
Okay.

3918
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:32,840
You have to find her or...

3919
02:34:32,840 --> 02:34:33,620
I do.

3920
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:37,300
Boy.

3921
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,520
I think maybe find her, don't find...

3922
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:41,340
The monster, right?

3923
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:42,360
Yeah.

3924
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:45,860
I hear her on the left.

3925
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:48,640
Your other left.

3926
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:54,500
There's too many.

3927
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:59,960
Why are they so hard to open?

3928
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:02,140
It's an easy door!

3929
02:35:03,400 --> 02:35:04,780
This is not easy.

3930
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:07,980
Who was that opening...

3931
02:35:07,980 --> 02:35:09,740
Opening things is not easy.

3932
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:13,600
Flash?

3933
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:15,400
There?

3934
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:16,800
Here?

3935
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:18,920
No.

3936
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:20,580
Oh, maybe?

3937
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:23,560
Oh wait, this might be the monster.

3938
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:25,560
Peekaboo!

3939
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:30,040
Can I open this?

3940
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:32,220
I'm gonna open everything...

3941
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:33,580
And it's gonna be the last thing I open.

3942
02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:39,320
I don't know.

3943
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:41,680
This is not easy.

3944
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:41,740
This is not easy.

3945
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:44,700
I still hear her on the left.

3946
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:45,380
Maybe this one.

3947
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:52,110
Is this a death?

3948
02:35:54,270 --> 02:35:55,390
Come on!

3949
02:36:01,010 --> 02:36:01,570
What?

3950
02:36:04,050 --> 02:36:05,330
We have to find her.

3951
02:36:05,670 --> 02:36:06,470
Not it.

3952
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:08,570
What sound does she make?

3953
02:36:08,710 --> 02:36:09,770
Minus that thing.

3954
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:10,590
Yeah.

3955
02:36:12,810 --> 02:36:14,550
What sound does she make?

3956
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:15,590
What if I just open...

3957
02:36:15,590 --> 02:36:16,530
Wait, where am I?

3958
02:36:18,050 --> 02:36:19,450
Let's open the first one.

3959
02:36:20,630 --> 02:36:21,870
So I need to find her.

3960
02:36:23,430 --> 02:36:23,710
Yeah.

3961
02:36:26,150 --> 02:36:26,670
Not...

3962
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:28,050
Okay.

3963
02:36:29,970 --> 02:36:30,910
Anything in here?

3964
02:36:32,790 --> 02:36:33,830
I don't...

3965
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:35,550
I think you should use your ears.

3966
02:36:36,010 --> 02:36:36,710
No, it's okay.

3967
02:36:40,990 --> 02:36:41,510
Okay.

3968
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:41,670
Okay.

3969
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:44,470
Guys, we'll be here forever.

3970
02:36:46,950 --> 02:36:47,870
It's okay.

3971
02:36:49,070 --> 02:36:49,510
Okay.

3972
02:36:50,910 --> 02:36:51,650
Not that one.

3973
02:36:53,450 --> 02:36:54,510
Maybe not that one.

3974
02:36:54,590 --> 02:36:54,850
Hold on.

3975
02:36:57,270 --> 02:36:57,830
Does she...

3976
02:36:57,830 --> 02:36:59,870
She doesn't...

3977
02:36:59,870 --> 02:37:00,870
I don't think that one.

3978
02:37:02,170 --> 02:37:03,950
She doesn't rumble, right?

3979
02:37:04,450 --> 02:37:07,510
I don't know.

3980
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:09,790
This one?

3981
02:37:12,010 --> 02:37:13,130
Wait, keep going to your left.

3982
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:16,960
There.

3983
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:23,820
How are you supposed to tell which one is her?

3984
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:28,960
Lucy makes...

3985
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:30,540
Apparently she makes gurgles.

3986
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:31,840
Okay.

3987
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:34,000
At least I found something.

3988
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:38,180
At least she used her ears, guys.

3989
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:39,920
At least...

3990
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:45,420
You know what?

3991
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:46,480
You get this one.

3992
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:47,280
You got this one.

3993
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:47,280
What?

3994
02:37:47,580 --> 02:37:47,980
No!

3995
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:55,140
They all gurgle.

3996
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:57,520
I don't know if they all gurgle.

3997
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:02,180
No, they definitely all don't gurgle.

3998
02:38:08,150 --> 02:38:09,330
I don't hear anything.

3999
02:38:10,250 --> 02:38:12,350
Yeah, because your volume is not up high enough.

4000
02:38:12,410 --> 02:38:14,590
No, but there's no gurgling from this door.

4001
02:38:15,490 --> 02:38:15,970
No.

4002
02:38:17,330 --> 02:38:19,470
Oh my god, that gurgle is so loud.

4003
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:23,190
Lucy's hungry.

4004
02:38:24,030 --> 02:38:26,070
That's Lucy's stomach, guys.

4005
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:27,590
Lucy, if you want...

4006
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:28,370
God damn it!

4007
02:38:28,490 --> 02:38:28,890
What?

4008
02:38:32,830 --> 02:38:35,730
If you want dinner tonight, Lucy, you better come out.

4009
02:38:35,850 --> 02:38:37,070
You better come out.

4010
02:38:37,950 --> 02:38:39,590
You're not getting dinner.

4011
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:41,310
We're having a favorite.

4012
02:38:42,010 --> 02:38:45,170
The peanut butter was so good.

4013
02:38:45,170 --> 02:38:45,950
Was it actually?

4014
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:47,190
But have you tried it without it?

4015
02:38:48,350 --> 02:38:48,790
Yes!

4016
02:38:50,110 --> 02:38:52,970
It's the only time I've tried banana bread without butter.

4017
02:38:53,070 --> 02:38:54,070
Yeah, yeah, but...

4018
02:38:54,070 --> 02:38:58,070
So you did an experiment to see if butter with banana bread was good?

4019
02:38:58,790 --> 02:39:01,330
Yeah, I trusted them.

4020
02:39:01,490 --> 02:39:02,390
They all said try.

4021
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:03,170
It's amazing.

4022
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:04,590
And I followed them.

4023
02:39:04,590 --> 02:39:06,170
What if I just open like this?

4024
02:39:08,230 --> 02:39:08,670
Oops.

4025
02:39:09,850 --> 02:39:11,790
Like, you can't get me if I don't look at it.

4026
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:13,890
But you still have to find her.

4027
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:19,160
What?

4028
02:39:30,740 --> 02:39:32,000
It's not the Weezy.

4029
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:33,760
I don't think it's the Weezy breathing.

4030
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:35,920
It's the...

4031
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:37,940
Oh my god!

4032
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:41,560
I was like, oh, it's this one.

4033
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:43,260
Don't go to the Weezy.

4034
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:45,580
Don't go to the asthmatic ghost.

4035
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:47,420
Go to the gurgle ghost.

4036
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:49,120
The gurgle ghost.

4037
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:50,820
They all sound the same.

4038
02:39:50,940 --> 02:39:51,480
I can't tell.

4039
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:53,500
Some of them are like this.

4040
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:55,100
That's the...

4041
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:57,120
You're clearly the ghost expert.

4042
02:39:57,380 --> 02:39:59,960
Let me know which door to open.

4043
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:02,020
No, I said you got this.

4044
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:02,760
No, no, no.

4045
02:40:03,020 --> 02:40:04,620
You're literally the ghost expert.

4046
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:09,740
You're the expert on ghosts.

4047
02:40:13,160 --> 02:40:14,620
I'm communicating with them.

4048
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:24,660
Someone said we're looking for a doll piece.

4049
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:25,000
Oh.

4050
02:40:26,140 --> 02:40:26,960
So maybe...

4051
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:29,760
Does this cabinet speak to you?

4052
02:40:30,020 --> 02:40:30,780
Shut up.

4053
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:34,200
I don't think there's anything in there.

4054
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,160
I'm double checking.

4055
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:41,400
You don't trust me.

4056
02:40:42,060 --> 02:40:42,980
Wait, to the left?

4057
02:40:45,260 --> 02:40:45,920
Wait, hold on.

4058
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:47,980
No, not that.

4059
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:51,840
That's the Weezy.

4060
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:52,860
That's the Weezy.

4061
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:54,100
Don't go to the Weezy.

4062
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:54,900
We don't want the Weezy.

4063
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:00,300
We want...

4064
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,720
It was back towards the other ones, no?

4065
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:06,200
Are they all randomized?

4066
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:09,300
Or am I just that unlucky and I keep opening the same one?

4067
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:12,120
I don't

4068
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:18,220
know anymore.

4069
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:26,220
No, I just accidentally did the camera.

4070
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:29,820
Sounds like a cat.

4071
02:41:30,820 --> 02:41:32,040
Sounds like my cat snoring.

4072
02:41:32,540 --> 02:41:33,740
The inbred one?

4073
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:36,680
Yeah, actually.

4074
02:41:38,920 --> 02:41:41,580
Sometimes he's so loud I can hear him from the other room.

4075
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:47,950
Is this one?

4076
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:55,660
I don't think so.

4077
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:00,680
Daddy's snoring in here.

4078
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:03,740
Daddy needs his machine.

4079
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:07,580
Daddy's CPAP machine.

4080
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:09,440
Where is it, Lucy?

4081
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:14,720
Daddy needs his CPAP machine.

4082
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:21,140
Where is it?

4083
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:24,660
Oh no.

4084
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:29,440
Maybe.

4085
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:35,280
There's nothing inside.

4086
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:37,020
Is there anything inside?

4087
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:38,040
No.

4088
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:40,400
Is there anything behind that one?

4089
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:43,400
Is there anything behind that gurgly?

4090
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:45,520
I don't think there's just one cabinet.

4091
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:47,240
Yeah, it's just against it.

4092
02:42:47,720 --> 02:42:48,180
What?

4093
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,940
Take a picture.

4094
02:42:51,160 --> 02:42:51,720
Snapshot.

4095
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:53,780
That's going to be my cringe compilation.

4096
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:59,460
I think that one is wheezy though.

4097
02:42:59,660 --> 02:43:01,560
I think it'll...

4098
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:02,580
I mean, he is wheezing.

4099
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:05,060
There's a back in front.

4100
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:08,540
Did the other one have a back?

4101
02:43:08,780 --> 02:43:11,240
No, it's like against the cabinet.

4102
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:12,560
It's against the wall.

4103
02:43:15,970 --> 02:43:17,270
This one sucks.

4104
02:43:18,090 --> 02:43:18,650
Yeah.

4105
02:43:18,650 --> 02:43:19,070
Yeah.

4106
02:43:20,310 --> 02:43:21,930
Try this one.

4107
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,080
No, that's the other side.

4108
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:29,680
Try the other side of it.

4109
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:31,680
Oh, I already opened the other side.

4110
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:32,440
Oh, you already opened it.

4111
02:43:32,540 --> 02:43:32,920
What?

4112
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:35,560
Is there actually...

4113
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:36,780
Yeah, I can't open it.

4114
02:43:36,780 --> 02:43:37,640
It's against the wall.

4115
02:43:38,660 --> 02:43:39,480
To the window.

4116
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:40,960
To the wall.

4117
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:45,440
It's against the wall.

4118
02:43:51,690 --> 02:43:53,510
Find a hole on the floor?

4119
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:54,670
What?

4120
02:43:55,190 --> 02:43:56,130
There's a hole?

4121
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:58,470
No.

4122
02:43:58,890 --> 02:44:00,690
Oh, the doll was just an achievement.

4123
02:44:01,630 --> 02:44:02,350
What?

4124
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:06,850
What was the point?

4125
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:09,430
Hole on the floor?

4126
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:10,470
There's a ladder.

4127
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:12,670
Where's the ladder?

4128
02:44:15,070 --> 02:44:16,230
No way.

4129
02:44:17,570 --> 02:44:19,310
Maybe if you should look at the floor.

4130
02:44:19,930 --> 02:44:21,270
Oh yeah, sorry.

4131
02:44:21,270 --> 02:44:21,590
I forgot.

4132
02:44:22,050 --> 02:44:23,310
That's where holes are.

4133
02:44:23,650 --> 02:44:25,330
That's where holes are.

4134
02:44:26,270 --> 02:44:27,890
I feel like we would've seen it though.

4135
02:44:28,130 --> 02:44:30,590
Oh, it's inside the cabinet.

4136
02:44:33,030 --> 02:44:34,970
We should've been looking inside.

4137
02:44:38,070 --> 02:44:40,730
Oh, so we're avoiding the gurgles.

4138
02:44:43,850 --> 02:44:45,630
The find the hole.

4139
02:44:50,470 --> 02:44:51,610
That one seems good.

4140
02:44:52,850 --> 02:44:53,970
Not much.

4141
02:44:54,790 --> 02:44:55,070
Maybe.

4142
02:44:55,630 --> 02:44:56,570
I think this one's fine.

4143
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:02,400
No.

4144
02:45:11,550 --> 02:45:13,490
I think there's something here.

4145
02:45:13,610 --> 02:45:14,150
But I don't know.

4146
02:45:14,670 --> 02:45:16,610
Oh, it's in the back corner of the room?

4147
02:45:19,450 --> 02:45:20,650
So like here?

4148
02:45:25,390 --> 02:45:26,990
There's so many sounds.

4149
02:45:28,310 --> 02:45:29,550
So many sounds.

4150
02:45:29,970 --> 02:45:30,810
Can I open this one?

4151
02:45:30,890 --> 02:45:31,190
I forgot.

4152
02:45:33,750 --> 02:45:37,250
I don't think they close if you open them, so...

4153
02:45:37,250 --> 02:45:37,650
No, no, no.

4154
02:45:37,690 --> 02:45:39,250
I mean like, but like...

4155
02:45:39,250 --> 02:45:39,870
Oh, can you?

4156
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:41,530
Yeah, do you think this has a monster?

4157
02:45:43,510 --> 02:45:44,410
I can't tell.

4158
02:45:45,370 --> 02:45:46,050
Can't tell.

4159
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:46,910
They're like everywhere.

4160
02:45:47,630 --> 02:45:49,010
It's just like, open me.

4161
02:45:49,410 --> 02:45:51,550
Definitely not that one.

4162
02:45:51,550 --> 02:45:52,890
Definitely not that one.

4163
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:54,510
Open me.

4164
02:45:54,850 --> 02:45:56,450
Open me.

4165
02:45:57,510 --> 02:45:58,850
That one's okay.

4166
02:46:01,330 --> 02:46:03,210
This one's fine.

4167
02:46:04,890 --> 02:46:13,490
Oh, can you quick save here?

4168
02:46:14,310 --> 02:46:14,670
Can I?

4169
02:46:15,950 --> 02:46:16,390
No.

4170
02:46:16,390 --> 02:46:19,030
Here, fuck you up.

4171
02:46:21,130 --> 02:46:22,710
Oh, you got the doll!

4172
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:27,230
I did it.

4173
02:46:28,630 --> 02:46:29,810
Okay, now we...

4174
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:31,870
That was not what we were looking for, but okay.

4175
02:46:33,010 --> 02:46:34,030
I ate the doll.

4176
02:46:38,470 --> 02:46:39,330
Can't tell.

4177
02:46:39,890 --> 02:46:41,930
I wish we had like a spray paint.

4178
02:46:42,210 --> 02:46:42,850
Yeah, I know.

4179
02:46:42,850 --> 02:46:44,610
I would be like, no for this one.

4180
02:46:44,810 --> 02:46:45,890
No, god damn it!

4181
02:46:46,370 --> 02:46:47,670
I did it again!

4182
02:46:49,570 --> 02:46:51,870
I was about to say not that one.

4183
02:46:52,030 --> 02:46:53,090
Why'd you open it?

4184
02:46:53,510 --> 02:46:56,290
I thought it was the same cabinet.

4185
02:46:59,070 --> 02:47:01,890
So is the hole inside the...

4186
02:47:01,890 --> 02:47:03,950
Yeah, it says inside the cabinet.

4187
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:11,150
When we got into that room, people were like, this is the worst part.

4188
02:47:14,290 --> 02:47:16,370
This is the worst part.

4189
02:47:16,670 --> 02:47:18,910
I'm gonna look it up, see if there's any tips.

4190
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:30,890
It's on the floor?!

4191
02:47:33,510 --> 02:47:35,650
Wait, you guys said it was in the cabinet!

4192
02:47:39,490 --> 02:47:40,990
Ladder is not in the wardrobe.

4193
02:47:41,610 --> 02:47:42,510
I fucking...

4194
02:47:42,510 --> 02:47:43,470
Oh my god.

4195
02:47:49,550 --> 02:47:50,710
Can't believe it.

4196
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:53,930
Massage cabinet room.

4197
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:56,310
I'm looking at the floor.

4198
02:47:57,710 --> 02:47:58,830
Where could it be?

4199
02:48:02,570 --> 02:48:07,250
Someone said as you enter the room, just look to your right and there's a hole in the corner of the map.

4200
02:48:07,350 --> 02:48:08,130
Fall into it.

4201
02:48:08,130 --> 02:48:08,670
Oh.

4202
02:48:10,650 --> 02:48:11,730
Oh, there it is.

4203
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:16,310
Look, there's the hole.

4204
02:48:20,030 --> 02:48:21,370
We did it.

4205
02:48:22,670 --> 02:48:23,750
Lucy, I'm back.

4206
02:48:23,990 --> 02:48:25,270
Oh, what the fuck?

4207
02:48:26,570 --> 02:48:27,330
Wait, what was that?

4208
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:28,970
There was like a shadow on the ground.

4209
02:48:29,230 --> 02:48:29,990
No, there wasn't.

4210
02:48:30,470 --> 02:48:31,050
Yeah, there was.

4211
02:48:31,110 --> 02:48:31,690
It was a...

4212
02:48:33,010 --> 02:48:34,310
Who was that?

4213
02:48:35,370 --> 02:48:36,150
Was that me?

4214
02:48:36,890 --> 02:48:39,170
Wait, if we stand there, does it become us?

4215
02:48:39,490 --> 02:48:40,050
Oh my god.

4216
02:48:41,350 --> 02:48:42,170
I'm him.

4217
02:48:42,830 --> 02:48:43,330
You're me.

4218
02:48:44,510 --> 02:48:48,190
Oh my god, that means we could've gotten the doll and left.

4219
02:48:48,990 --> 02:48:50,190
Oh my god.

4220
02:48:50,470 --> 02:48:52,510
It could've...

4221
02:48:52,510 --> 02:48:54,110
Wait, try...

4222
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:55,650
Wait, there's gotta be something with him.

4223
02:48:55,810 --> 02:48:57,410
Oh, see how it's lifted up there.

4224
02:48:58,410 --> 02:48:59,690
Click it, click, click.

4225
02:49:01,190 --> 02:49:01,850
Or interact.

4226
02:49:01,950 --> 02:49:03,350
Oh yeah, there it is.

4227
02:49:03,410 --> 02:49:04,370
Oh, there's another hole.

4228
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:07,030
If there's a hole, there's a goal.

4229
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,350
Yeah.

4230
02:49:08,650 --> 02:49:09,110
Goodbye.

4231
02:49:09,110 --> 02:49:13,990
You must pay the troll toll to get into the boy's hole.

4232
02:49:15,710 --> 02:49:16,630
Oh, this doesn't look good.

4233
02:49:16,650 --> 02:49:17,290
Oh, it's saving...

4234
02:49:17,290 --> 02:49:19,790
Why every time I try to save?

4235
02:49:20,690 --> 02:49:22,330
What's the point of the quicksave?

4236
02:49:22,530 --> 02:49:25,890
Yeah, how am I supposed to use a quicksave if I can't quicksave?

4237
02:49:26,830 --> 02:49:29,150
Ooh, sticking my hand through it, just like Silent Hill.

4238
02:49:29,570 --> 02:49:30,830
Yeah, just like Silent Hill.

4239
02:49:30,830 --> 02:49:31,710
Yeah.

4240
02:49:32,930 --> 02:49:35,010
But at least this time it's not a potty.

4241
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:36,030
Yeah.

4242
02:49:38,910 --> 02:49:39,870
What did I get?

4243
02:49:40,210 --> 02:49:40,950
What is that?

4244
02:49:41,150 --> 02:49:42,910
You're tearing apart the foundation.

4245
02:49:43,310 --> 02:49:45,510
Yeah, I was like...

4246
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:48,390
Oh my god, I got a whole fucking stick.

4247
02:49:49,550 --> 02:49:50,710
What is that?

4248
02:49:50,830 --> 02:49:51,510
What did I get?

4249
02:49:55,050 --> 02:49:55,790
That's it?

4250
02:49:55,790 --> 02:49:55,850
That's it?

4251
02:49:58,150 --> 02:49:59,450
What is that?

4252
02:49:59,570 --> 02:50:00,410
What did I do?

4253
02:50:01,370 --> 02:50:04,310
Maybe it moves something on the other side.

4254
02:50:04,370 --> 02:50:04,870
Oh.

4255
02:50:07,570 --> 02:50:08,750
Unlock the passage?

4256
02:50:09,170 --> 02:50:10,250
But how do I get out?

4257
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:13,290
Does it unlock another passage here?

4258
02:50:13,950 --> 02:50:14,410
Maybe.

4259
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:20,080
Just check it out.

4260
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:21,500
Oh yeah, I can go back up.

4261
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:23,200
Oh, I can go back up.

4262
02:50:24,220 --> 02:50:24,700
Okay.

4263
02:50:24,700 --> 02:50:25,500
I'm not locked in.

4264
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:27,120
Okay.

4265
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:29,760
Okay, saving is still disabled.

4266
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:31,860
Okay, fine.

4267
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:33,820
Wait, try it when you're not on the stairs.

4268
02:50:34,580 --> 02:50:35,540
Okay, nevermind.

4269
02:50:35,860 --> 02:50:37,840
Oh, it locks something over here, right?

4270
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:40,000
Probably.

4271
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,540
That's where I came from.

4272
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:43,860
Or not where I came from, but that's where...

4273
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:44,560
Maybe this room.

4274
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:46,960
Oh, hey, panda.

4275
02:50:47,440 --> 02:50:48,740
It's the weed room.

4276
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:51,780
This is daddy's business.

4277
02:50:52,360 --> 02:50:54,520
Daddy's secret business.

4278
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:56,660
Wait, I just sit here.

4279
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:59,480
Daddy is breaking bad up in here.

4280
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:03,000
Schedule one daddy.

4281
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:06,820
Schedule one daddy time.

4282
02:51:11,010 --> 02:51:12,130
What's in here?

4283
02:51:12,430 --> 02:51:13,290
Use your lighter.

4284
02:51:13,670 --> 02:51:14,250
Use your lighter.

4285
02:51:14,650 --> 02:51:15,570
Use the lighter.

4286
02:51:16,710 --> 02:51:17,030
Oh.

4287
02:51:19,650 --> 02:51:20,070
Oh.

4288
02:51:20,070 --> 02:51:20,610
Daddy's sorry.

4289
02:51:21,550 --> 02:51:22,670
Daddy didn't mean it.

4290
02:51:23,190 --> 02:51:24,310
Daddy didn't mean it.

4291
02:51:24,370 --> 02:51:24,910
Daddy quit.

4292
02:51:25,070 --> 02:51:27,670
Daddy doesn't do that anymore.

4293
02:51:27,710 --> 02:51:28,430
Daddy doesn't do that anymore.

4294
02:51:28,510 --> 02:51:29,230
Don't tell mommy.

4295
02:51:33,070 --> 02:51:34,370
Daddy stopped cooking.

4296
02:51:37,270 --> 02:51:38,050
Try this door.

4297
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:46,370
Oh, I have to go to that room.

4298
02:51:48,730 --> 02:51:50,710
No, there was another door right there too though.

4299
02:51:50,910 --> 02:51:51,250
Behind you.

4300
02:51:51,890 --> 02:51:52,750
Oh, nevermind.

4301
02:51:52,810 --> 02:51:53,130
Just kidding.

4302
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:54,650
I didn't realize there was a chair.

4303
02:51:55,290 --> 02:51:55,730
What?

4304
02:52:01,780 --> 02:52:02,780
It lit up.

4305
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:04,100
Oh, there's a dresser.

4306
02:52:05,340 --> 02:52:06,200
I can't see.

4307
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:08,460
I can't see.

4308
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:10,700
Yeah, that's kind of horrible.

4309
02:52:11,240 --> 02:52:12,200
I can't see.

4310
02:52:13,320 --> 02:52:14,400
Why are you pausing?

4311
02:52:14,600 --> 02:52:15,800
I can't see.

4312
02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:18,380
Turn the gamma up.

4313
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:22,720
Turn the gamma up.

4314
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:23,820
Okay.

4315
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:26,240
Alright.

4316
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:27,680
Okay.

4317
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:29,880
Daddy needs to see you real quick.

4318
02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:31,780
Yeah, it's just too dark.

4319
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:33,080
I still can't see.

4320
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:35,540
Just go forward.

4321
02:52:36,500 --> 02:52:37,520
Just go in there.

4322
02:52:39,560 --> 02:52:40,840
Why are you turning around?

4323
02:52:40,980 --> 02:52:42,760
I can't fucking see.

4324
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:42,920
I can't see.

4325
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:44,100
What do you mean?

4326
02:52:46,340 --> 02:52:48,480
Like, what do I look at?

4327
02:52:55,460 --> 02:52:55,980
Hello?

4328
02:52:56,700 --> 02:52:57,200
Hello?

4329
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:05,340
No, it won't let me use the lighter.

4330
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:08,000
It says something I won't light up.

4331
02:53:08,260 --> 02:53:09,440
Yeah, it did say that.

4332
02:53:10,020 --> 02:53:11,360
It did say that.

4333
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:13,280
What about in the...

4334
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:14,480
On the plants?

4335
02:53:15,880 --> 02:53:17,000
Light it up, baby.

4336
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:22,660
Do I not go here?

4337
02:53:23,740 --> 02:53:25,560
There's gotta be something else in there, no?

4338
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:26,900
All you did was see a panda.

4339
02:53:27,260 --> 02:53:27,560
Yeah.

4340
02:53:28,180 --> 02:53:30,840
I have to touch the chair again?

4341
02:53:37,050 --> 02:53:37,950
Maybe not.

4342
02:53:38,210 --> 02:53:39,210
Maybe not, yeah.

4343
02:53:43,590 --> 02:53:45,650
Oh, there's another chair?

4344
02:53:46,290 --> 02:53:48,870
Oh, the one by the closet, right there.

4345
02:53:48,870 --> 02:53:49,590
Oh, this one.

4346
02:53:49,990 --> 02:53:50,430
Oh!

4347
02:53:51,430 --> 02:53:53,430
Oh, Nemi, thank you for the raid!

4348
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:55,470
Oh, Nemi!

4349
02:53:56,010 --> 02:53:56,330
Hey!

4350
02:53:56,770 --> 02:53:57,930
Sorry, my gamma's up all the way.

4351
02:53:57,970 --> 02:53:58,530
I couldn't see.

4352
02:53:58,950 --> 02:53:59,390
I...

4353
02:54:02,690 --> 02:54:03,850
No, you don't understand.

4354
02:54:04,250 --> 02:54:07,030
It was that one room, guys.

4355
02:54:07,190 --> 02:54:08,250
It was for the new...

4356
02:54:08,250 --> 02:54:10,230
It was literally that one room.

4357
02:54:11,110 --> 02:54:11,990
Hello, Naplings!

4358
02:54:12,530 --> 02:54:13,010
Hello!

4359
02:54:13,870 --> 02:54:15,410
I cannot store this.

4360
02:54:15,590 --> 02:54:17,730
What the fuck do you mean I can't store it?

4361
02:54:17,810 --> 02:54:19,290
Put it in my pocket!

4362
02:54:20,290 --> 02:54:20,510
Wait.

4363
02:54:22,970 --> 02:54:24,250
Yeah, put that away.

4364
02:54:24,490 --> 02:54:25,350
Use both hands.

4365
02:54:25,450 --> 02:54:26,230
There you go.

4366
02:54:26,390 --> 02:54:28,110
Oh, I need to use two hands.

4367
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:29,830
Two hands.

4368
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:30,990
Two hands.

4369
02:54:31,430 --> 02:54:32,350
Gotta put it down.

4370
02:54:34,830 --> 02:54:35,790
Okay, now...

4371
02:54:35,790 --> 02:54:36,390
Oh, oh!

4372
02:54:42,350 --> 02:54:42,910
Interact?

4373
02:54:43,410 --> 02:54:43,970
Drop?

4374
02:54:46,030 --> 02:54:46,690
Oh, there you go.

4375
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:48,410
I figured it out.

4376
02:54:48,410 --> 02:54:51,410
I figured it out.

4377
02:54:52,250 --> 02:54:53,670
Daddy knows what she's doing.

4378
02:54:55,730 --> 02:54:56,290
Okay.

4379
02:54:57,930 --> 02:54:58,490
Lucy...

4380
02:54:59,710 --> 02:55:02,090
You locked me in the closet, Lucy!

4381
02:55:02,530 --> 02:55:04,050
That does not make daddy happy.

4382
02:55:04,050 --> 02:55:08,930
We are playing as a dad who killed their family.

4383
02:55:09,810 --> 02:55:13,210
And we're on the daughter's chapter.

4384
02:55:13,770 --> 02:55:14,810
Yeah, we're on Lucy's chapter.

4385
02:55:14,830 --> 02:55:17,230
For anybody curious why we keep saying daddy.

4386
02:55:19,450 --> 02:55:20,450
I would also be concerned.

4387
02:55:21,690 --> 02:55:22,390
Was that a candle?

4388
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:29,330
What did he do?

4389
02:55:29,790 --> 02:55:31,130
What did he do?

4390
02:55:31,490 --> 02:55:34,710
Why did he throw sand at us?

4391
02:55:34,910 --> 02:55:36,250
What the fuck?

4392
02:55:36,250 --> 02:55:38,010
What is he doing?

4393
02:55:41,410 --> 02:55:43,730
That's daddy's daddy, guys.

4394
02:55:44,610 --> 02:55:47,710
Oh no, it's uncle Joe.

4395
02:55:48,150 --> 02:55:49,270
It's uncle Joe.

4396
02:55:49,890 --> 02:55:53,250
Oh no, he's always been a little bit weird.

4397
02:55:54,410 --> 02:55:55,750
Wait, what was that?

4398
02:55:56,150 --> 02:55:57,890
I don't know, I'm not looking for it.

4399
02:55:58,350 --> 02:55:58,670
Okay.

4400
02:56:00,050 --> 02:56:01,430
Ignore uncle.

4401
02:56:03,170 --> 02:56:04,850
Ignore daddy's special friend.

4402
02:56:09,090 --> 02:56:10,050
Oh no.

4403
02:56:10,990 --> 02:56:13,250
Why won't it light up?

4404
02:56:13,590 --> 02:56:14,530
I'm in a maze.

4405
02:56:15,650 --> 02:56:17,090
Oh gosh, can you save here?

4406
02:56:18,930 --> 02:56:20,610
Are you kidding me?

4407
02:56:21,070 --> 02:56:24,430
What's the point of quick saving in this game?

4408
02:56:25,590 --> 02:56:26,210
Where am I?

4409
02:56:26,690 --> 02:56:29,710
Where the fuck am I?

4410
02:56:30,750 --> 02:56:32,510
Where is this place?

4411
02:56:32,670 --> 02:56:34,190
Where is this hellhole I'm in?

4412
02:56:37,110 --> 02:56:39,690
Oh, that's a painting of...

4413
02:56:39,690 --> 02:56:40,250
Uncle Joe.

4414
02:56:40,850 --> 02:56:42,110
Wait, how am I seeing uncle Joe?

4415
02:56:46,930 --> 02:56:48,810
That's uncle Joe's special mask.

4416
02:56:51,670 --> 02:56:52,230
Okay.

4417
02:56:53,290 --> 02:56:55,270
So this is an actual maze, it seems.

4418
02:56:56,330 --> 02:56:58,050
Oh no, I don't do well with mazes.

4419
02:56:59,370 --> 02:57:00,310
Well, it's like...

4420
02:57:01,310 --> 02:57:02,590
Have I been here before?

4421
02:57:03,010 --> 02:57:03,990
That door is open.

4422
02:57:04,470 --> 02:57:05,810
Have I been here?

4423
02:57:06,490 --> 02:57:08,250
I don't remember, Mint.

4424
02:57:09,410 --> 02:57:10,250
I don't know.

4425
02:57:12,050 --> 02:57:13,450
Oh, oh, wait.

4426
02:57:14,270 --> 02:57:15,370
This looks promising.

4427
02:57:15,650 --> 02:57:16,230
Oh, there's a key!

4428
02:57:17,290 --> 02:57:18,670
Did you see the door?

4429
02:57:18,870 --> 02:57:19,410
There was a locked door.

4430
02:57:19,530 --> 02:57:20,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where did I go?

4431
02:57:21,670 --> 02:57:22,850
I think it was upstairs.

4432
02:57:23,950 --> 02:57:24,930
I'm gonna go this way.

4433
02:57:25,610 --> 02:57:27,130
Okay, it was upstairs.

4434
02:57:31,290 --> 02:57:31,730
Okay.

4435
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:35,430
Okay.

4436
02:57:35,430 --> 02:57:38,430
It was down like a regular hallway, not one of these...

4437
02:57:38,430 --> 02:57:39,530
Crusty, dusty hallways.

4438
02:57:39,990 --> 02:57:41,250
Maybe that one right there.

4439
02:57:41,550 --> 02:57:41,790
Oh, no.

4440
02:57:42,610 --> 02:57:44,210
Oh, there's that one.

4441
02:57:44,710 --> 02:57:46,530
The only other door.

4442
02:57:47,630 --> 02:57:48,970
I couldn't remember.

4443
02:57:50,650 --> 02:57:52,030
Another area or not.

4444
02:57:52,090 --> 02:57:53,350
Everything looks the same.

4445
02:57:55,250 --> 02:57:59,210
Why has this not been renovated?

4446
02:58:01,350 --> 02:58:02,470
I think...

4447
02:58:02,470 --> 02:58:02,910
Uh-oh.

4448
02:58:04,190 --> 02:58:05,070
Does that have a clue?

4449
02:58:06,230 --> 02:58:06,730
Uh-oh.

4450
02:58:08,970 --> 02:58:09,790
Uncle Joe?

4451
02:58:09,990 --> 02:58:10,570
Uncle Joe?

4452
02:58:11,010 --> 02:58:11,830
Uncle Joe?

4453
02:58:13,150 --> 02:58:13,470
Uncle Joe?

4454
02:58:16,270 --> 02:58:18,230
It won't let me go for it.

4455
02:58:19,090 --> 02:58:19,350
Oh.

4456
02:58:20,290 --> 02:58:21,110
Are you sure?

4457
02:58:22,010 --> 02:58:24,090
Oh, it's Uncle Joe's friends.

4458
02:58:25,250 --> 02:58:25,470
What?

4459
02:58:26,030 --> 02:58:27,430
That's a person moving.

4460
02:58:28,270 --> 02:58:28,870
What?

4461
02:58:28,870 --> 02:58:29,010
What?

4462
02:58:29,290 --> 02:58:30,510
Wait, can you take out your lighter?

4463
02:58:33,330 --> 02:58:33,850
What?

4464
02:58:34,250 --> 02:58:34,550
Wait.

4465
02:58:35,490 --> 02:58:37,270
How do I get out of here?

4466
02:58:37,750 --> 02:58:40,510
Maybe we have to find a plank of wood and put it across.

4467
02:58:42,170 --> 02:58:42,690
Wait.

4468
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:48,650
Was I supposed to bring that plank with me this entire time?

4469
02:58:49,390 --> 02:58:49,910
No.

4470
02:58:50,330 --> 02:58:50,850
No.

4471
02:58:53,350 --> 02:58:54,810
Maybe I'll bring this.

4472
02:58:55,810 --> 02:58:56,750
Can I bring this?

4473
02:58:56,750 --> 02:58:58,050
It works just as well.

4474
02:58:58,390 --> 02:59:00,450
Also, why can't we just jump?

4475
02:59:01,870 --> 02:59:02,190
Wait.

4476
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:03,410
The plank from before?

4477
02:59:04,090 --> 02:59:05,070
No way.

4478
02:59:05,490 --> 02:59:07,730
Yeah, you couldn't pick it up, no?

4479
02:59:08,050 --> 02:59:09,610
I couldn't.

4480
02:59:10,530 --> 02:59:11,470
No way.

4481
02:59:11,650 --> 02:59:13,310
Don't do this to me.

4482
02:59:13,810 --> 02:59:16,030
Don't do this.

4483
02:59:17,110 --> 02:59:18,550
The one standing up?

4484
02:59:18,610 --> 02:59:20,050
There's a plank that stands up?

4485
02:59:21,630 --> 02:59:22,950
Oh, is this the one with the eyes?

4486
02:59:23,450 --> 02:59:26,430
Oh, that one.

4487
02:59:26,430 --> 02:59:27,170
Just don't worry.

4488
02:59:28,370 --> 02:59:29,750
I think they should...

4489
02:59:29,750 --> 02:59:30,810
They should have painted it yellow.

4490
02:59:31,150 --> 02:59:33,570
I was going to say...

4491
02:59:33,570 --> 02:59:35,570
They need to do the gamer paint.

4492
02:59:35,990 --> 02:59:39,230
No, I'm like that wiener dog that tries to carry the stick through.

4493
02:59:41,650 --> 02:59:43,870
How do I bring the stick over?

4494
02:59:47,490 --> 02:59:49,650
We need gamer paint, everybody.

4495
02:59:49,790 --> 02:59:51,350
It's proven to be necessary.

4496
02:59:51,970 --> 02:59:54,750
Yeah, the eyes don't work as well.

4497
02:59:55,310 --> 02:59:55,750
Yeah.

4498
02:59:56,690 --> 02:59:57,790
It's so dark.

4499
02:59:58,010 --> 02:59:59,390
They won't even let us use our...

4500
02:59:59,390 --> 03:00:00,370
Yeah, lighter.

4501
03:00:00,470 --> 03:00:00,830
Our lighter.

4502
03:00:04,430 --> 03:00:04,870
Hello,

4503
03:00:09,230 --> 03:00:09,710
I'm okay.

4504
03:00:11,730 --> 03:00:12,770
I would just go.

4505
03:00:13,110 --> 03:00:13,870
I would just keep walking.

4506
03:00:14,950 --> 03:00:16,310
Did you see him go into that room?

4507
03:00:16,730 --> 03:00:17,390
That was kind of crazy.

4508
03:00:18,330 --> 03:00:19,210
Look forward.

4509
03:00:19,790 --> 03:00:20,450
Doki bird.

4510
03:00:21,430 --> 03:00:24,170
But the camera scares him.

4511
03:00:25,130 --> 03:00:27,650
He said the camera scares him.

4512
03:00:29,330 --> 03:00:31,250
Let's go to the red room.

4513
03:00:34,370 --> 03:00:36,070
Red means scary.

4514
03:00:39,350 --> 03:00:41,530
Did I close it?

4515
03:00:41,870 --> 03:00:43,490
I don't know how to open doors.

4516
03:00:43,950 --> 03:00:44,850
I don't know if you noticed that.

4517
03:00:45,350 --> 03:00:47,170
It just happened.

4518
03:00:48,390 --> 03:00:49,410
I don't know.

4519
03:00:49,690 --> 03:00:51,390
I couldn't open the door properly.

4520
03:00:52,750 --> 03:00:55,070
I can't see what's happening!

4521
03:00:55,650 --> 03:00:57,650
You can't make it scary when I don't...

4522
03:00:57,650 --> 03:00:59,530
Oh, it's an empty...

4523
03:01:03,030 --> 03:01:05,130
What's the paintings?

4524
03:01:06,030 --> 03:01:07,230
Wait, it changed.

4525
03:01:08,190 --> 03:01:08,710
Oh, yeah.

4526
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:10,350
That way.

4527
03:01:10,610 --> 03:01:10,990
That way?

4528
03:01:12,770 --> 03:01:13,950
Is it not this way?

4529
03:01:13,950 --> 03:01:15,110
Did I come from here?

4530
03:01:15,310 --> 03:01:16,150
Did I come from here?

4531
03:01:17,090 --> 03:01:19,390
Oh, you're right.

4532
03:01:19,530 --> 03:01:20,250
I don't know.

4533
03:01:20,390 --> 03:01:21,030
I'm lost.

4534
03:01:25,850 --> 03:01:26,630
That way.

4535
03:01:27,390 --> 03:01:27,910
Oh,

4536
03:01:39,170 --> 03:01:41,530
I thought that was Lucy.

4537
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:46,310
Can't see.

4538
03:01:46,430 --> 03:01:47,530
Oh my God, my eyes.

4539
03:01:50,430 --> 03:01:51,010
Okay.

4540
03:01:51,930 --> 03:01:53,330
I just messed up.

4541
03:01:53,890 --> 03:01:55,450
Where am I?

4542
03:01:57,250 --> 03:01:58,910
Follow the dust particles.

4543
03:01:59,490 --> 03:02:00,550
Follow the dust particles.

4544
03:02:03,190 --> 03:02:04,710
There's a hole, there's a gold.

4545
03:02:06,070 --> 03:02:08,870
Okay, we found somewhere new.

4546
03:02:08,950 --> 03:02:09,530
Wait, turn around.

4547
03:02:10,350 --> 03:02:12,330
Oh wait, there could be items.

4548
03:02:12,330 --> 03:02:13,190
Yeah, see?

4549
03:02:13,790 --> 03:02:15,330
I have not been picking those up.

4550
03:02:15,790 --> 03:02:16,690
That's fine.

4551
03:02:18,410 --> 03:02:19,390
Where am I?

4552
03:02:19,870 --> 03:02:21,070
Oh my God, are we hoarders?

4553
03:02:23,550 --> 03:02:25,270
This is from Daddy's business.

4554
03:02:25,490 --> 03:02:26,730
He collects antiques.

4555
03:02:27,850 --> 03:02:29,350
Oh, is it parkour?

4556
03:02:29,590 --> 03:02:30,850
I can't move.

4557
03:02:31,230 --> 03:02:32,270
Oh wait, no, parkour!

4558
03:02:33,030 --> 03:02:35,110
This is Daddy's own parkour area.

4559
03:02:37,450 --> 03:02:39,550
Daddy is trading for American Ninja.

4560
03:02:42,330 --> 03:02:43,730
Can I be famous, Lucy?

4561
03:02:45,230 --> 03:02:46,550
Give me a sec.

4562
03:02:47,230 --> 03:02:50,330
I'm learning American Ninja right now.

4563
03:02:53,890 --> 03:02:54,730
Let's go!

4564
03:02:56,430 --> 03:02:57,430
American Ninja.

4565
03:02:57,750 --> 03:02:59,630
This is what they mean when they said...

4566
03:02:59,630 --> 03:03:03,410
When I was a kid, I walked uphill everyday to get to school.

4567
03:03:04,370 --> 03:03:05,910
This is what they meant by that.

4568
03:03:08,070 --> 03:03:11,250
My father created his own little obstacle course.

4569
03:03:12,330 --> 03:03:13,470
I'm gonna ruin his ass.

4570
03:03:13,750 --> 03:03:15,170
What have you done?

4571
03:03:16,990 --> 03:03:18,170
I'm back here.

4572
03:03:19,930 --> 03:03:21,350
Oh, we are back here.

4573
03:03:21,390 --> 03:03:22,030
This is the basement.

4574
03:03:22,910 --> 03:03:24,330
Oh, what's going on?

4575
03:03:24,570 --> 03:03:25,890
Oh, it's all scratched up.

4576
03:03:26,710 --> 03:03:27,730
Was it like that before?

4577
03:03:27,910 --> 03:03:28,830
No, it was not.

4578
03:03:30,410 --> 03:03:31,570
No, it was not.

4579
03:03:31,590 --> 03:03:32,590
All these damn lights.

4580
03:03:33,810 --> 03:03:34,790
Piss me off!

4581
03:03:35,390 --> 03:03:37,170
I'm so mad.

4582
03:03:37,170 --> 03:03:37,230
I'm so mad.

4583
03:03:41,950 --> 03:03:44,250
All these damn light covers.

4584
03:03:45,530 --> 03:03:46,870
Where do we go now?

4585
03:03:46,950 --> 03:03:47,530
What do we do?

4586
03:03:48,710 --> 03:03:50,530
We go back upstairs?

4587
03:03:52,330 --> 03:03:53,730
How do I go upstairs?

4588
03:03:53,870 --> 03:03:54,810
I don't remember.

4589
03:03:55,070 --> 03:03:56,050
Turn to the left.

4590
03:03:56,910 --> 03:03:57,250
Here?

4591
03:03:58,070 --> 03:03:59,430
No, turn around.

4592
03:04:00,940 --> 03:04:01,890
Right, there you go.

4593
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:08,300
What's that sound?

4594
03:04:08,300 --> 03:04:09,720
I was taking pills.

4595
03:04:10,760 --> 03:04:12,060
Oh, I think it's this one.

4596
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:13,300
Can you save now?

4597
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:14,600
Yeah, check if you can save now.

4598
03:04:14,860 --> 03:04:15,560
Oh yeah, I should.

4599
03:04:18,400 --> 03:04:20,720
Oh my god, the one moment where I could...

4600
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:21,480
It works!

4601
03:04:21,560 --> 03:04:22,700
The feature works!

4602
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:28,400
Wait, I'm going back to the basement.

4603
03:04:30,620 --> 03:04:32,060
Oh, she blocked the door.

4604
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:32,760
Okay.

4605
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:38,200
Does anybody know what to do?

4606
03:04:38,920 --> 03:04:41,000
Someone said like to the bathroom.

4607
03:04:42,060 --> 03:04:42,600
Oh, okay.

4608
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:45,820
Maybe there's another mannequin head.

4609
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:47,200
Like the top.

4610
03:04:48,880 --> 03:04:49,920
There's a lighter.

4611
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:51,720
Oh, hey!

4612
03:04:52,740 --> 03:04:53,520
Close the door.

4613
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:55,120
That's my private business.

4614
03:04:56,340 --> 03:04:57,960
What am I supposed to do in the bathroom?

4615
03:04:58,920 --> 03:05:00,340
Did you do that?

4616
03:05:00,340 --> 03:05:00,820
No.

4617
03:05:03,460 --> 03:05:04,040
Hello?

4618
03:05:05,440 --> 03:05:06,500
Sorry, I couldn't go over.

4619
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:07,400
I pushed the cover.

4620
03:05:11,870 --> 03:05:13,170
What's the ambiance for?

4621
03:05:14,170 --> 03:05:14,750
Hello?

4622
03:05:15,790 --> 03:05:17,770
God, they have so much toilet paper.

4623
03:05:19,230 --> 03:05:19,810
Hello?

4624
03:05:21,170 --> 03:05:21,870
What are you doing?

4625
03:05:22,170 --> 03:05:22,730
I don't know.

4626
03:05:25,210 --> 03:05:25,790
Hello?

4627
03:05:27,030 --> 03:05:27,910
Who are you...

4628
03:05:27,910 --> 03:05:28,950
Who are you talking to?

4629
03:05:28,950 --> 03:05:30,150
Hello?

4630
03:05:30,390 --> 03:05:31,730
She locked me in.

4631
03:05:32,330 --> 03:05:32,930
She did?

4632
03:05:33,270 --> 03:05:33,730
Yeah.

4633
03:05:34,730 --> 03:05:35,510
You can't leave?

4634
03:05:37,450 --> 03:05:38,610
Oh, it's jammed.

4635
03:05:40,090 --> 03:05:40,610
Lucy?

4636
03:05:41,210 --> 03:05:43,810
Daddy's not happy you locked the bathroom, Lucy.

4637
03:05:48,510 --> 03:05:50,170
Just open the door.

4638
03:05:50,310 --> 03:05:50,790
Are you stupid?

4639
03:05:50,790 --> 03:05:50,870
Oh!

4640
03:05:55,870 --> 03:05:57,590
Daddy doesn't want to take a bath.

4641
03:06:03,790 --> 03:06:05,030
Is it going to turn red?

4642
03:06:07,730 --> 03:06:08,950
Oh, you have...

4643
03:06:08,950 --> 03:06:10,990
You can put the hair dryer in it.

4644
03:06:14,330 --> 03:06:15,930
Oh my god, our candle is...

4645
03:06:15,930 --> 03:06:17,250
Lucy called me stinky.

4646
03:06:18,570 --> 03:06:19,190
Lucy?

4647
03:06:20,350 --> 03:06:21,190
I'm not stinky.

4648
03:06:22,350 --> 03:06:24,430
Look, daddy lost his job.

4649
03:06:24,630 --> 03:06:25,710
So, it's been rough.

4650
03:06:27,530 --> 03:06:30,430
Daddy built the world's most complicated house.

4651
03:06:30,710 --> 03:06:31,790
So, I get really sweaty.

4652
03:06:36,710 --> 03:06:38,730
What do we do here?

4653
03:06:39,250 --> 03:06:40,490
I'm just waiting.

4654
03:06:40,830 --> 03:06:42,350
My lighter is going to go out soon.

4655
03:06:42,950 --> 03:06:44,370
She took the light covers.

4656
03:06:44,510 --> 03:06:45,810
Like, what the fuck did I do?

4657
03:06:46,290 --> 03:06:47,410
You got another lighter, though.

4658
03:06:47,490 --> 03:06:48,110
You're going to be okay.

4659
03:06:48,470 --> 03:06:49,370
Yeah, I have another one.

4660
03:06:50,590 --> 03:06:53,250
She knew that we just went through our American...

4661
03:06:53,810 --> 03:06:54,530
Ninja training.

4662
03:06:54,530 --> 03:06:56,630
Yeah, my American ninja training.

4663
03:06:56,870 --> 03:06:57,030
Yeah.

4664
03:07:01,190 --> 03:07:03,110
Check around is what people are saying.

4665
03:07:03,170 --> 03:07:03,710
Check around.

4666
03:07:07,160 --> 03:07:08,000
Check around what?

4667
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:09,080
She locked me in.

4668
03:07:10,280 --> 03:07:12,580
Wait, did the cabinet just open?

4669
03:07:12,580 --> 03:07:14,600
No, I opened it.

4670
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:20,300
Camera flush the tap.

4671
03:07:22,560 --> 03:07:24,120
Oh, is she going to appear in the tub?

4672
03:07:27,800 --> 03:07:29,420
I feel like she's going to come out.

4673
03:07:31,700 --> 03:07:35,740
No, I feel like she's just going to come out of the tub and be like...

4674
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:38,980
But this is like the longest build-up ever.

4675
03:07:38,980 --> 03:07:41,060
I know, like, what if I just don't look?

4676
03:07:42,660 --> 03:07:43,140
Oh!

4677
03:07:44,920 --> 03:07:45,400
Flash!

4678
03:07:45,720 --> 03:07:46,000
Flash!

4679
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:46,660
Flash it!

4680
03:07:46,900 --> 03:07:47,340
Flash it!

4681
03:07:48,380 --> 03:07:49,720
It's afraid of the light.

4682
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:50,820
Oh.

4683
03:07:51,500 --> 03:07:52,880
What a peeper.

4684
03:07:53,140 --> 03:07:53,720
I know.

4685
03:07:55,320 --> 03:07:57,320
They're like, we know you try to not look.

4686
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:03,600
Also, why is there a window in the bathroom?

4687
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:05,460
Yeah, I was about to say, why do we have a window?

4688
03:08:06,220 --> 03:08:06,880
Why is it?

4689
03:08:07,060 --> 03:08:11,080
Did it make, like, the tiniest window in the fucking bathroom?

4690
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:15,400
Um...

4691
03:08:15,400 --> 03:08:16,240
Um...

4692
03:08:16,780 --> 03:08:17,280
Wait...

4693
03:08:17,280 --> 03:08:19,100
She's going to pop out, isn't she?

4694
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:20,120
I'm not giving her that satisfaction.

4695
03:08:20,120 --> 03:08:22,000
Look around a little bit more, maybe you'll see another one.

4696
03:08:22,200 --> 03:08:22,780
Another guy.

4697
03:08:23,960 --> 03:08:25,520
There's only one window.

4698
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:27,220
Uh...

4699
03:08:28,820 --> 03:08:29,320
Try...

4700
03:08:32,400 --> 03:08:32,900
Try...

4701
03:08:32,900 --> 03:08:33,160
Oh.

4702
03:08:36,620 --> 03:08:37,760
Maybe it's time.

4703
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:37,880
It's time.

4704
03:08:42,450 --> 03:08:43,810
No, she has the lights.

4705
03:08:43,970 --> 03:08:45,430
She took the light switches, guys.

4706
03:08:45,430 --> 03:08:48,370
Yeah, she took all the light switches, so we can't turn on the lights.

4707
03:08:48,670 --> 03:08:50,170
Yeah, she's been a bad girl.

4708
03:08:51,130 --> 03:08:52,050
Oh, wait!

4709
03:08:56,320 --> 03:08:57,740
She forgot one.

4710
03:08:59,460 --> 03:08:59,920
Lucy!

4711
03:09:01,280 --> 03:09:01,740
Shame.

4712
03:09:03,440 --> 03:09:04,360
Poor shame.

4713
03:09:05,120 --> 03:09:05,960
I like how...

4714
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:09,140
Wait, did we have our gamma still up, by the way?

4715
03:09:09,420 --> 03:09:10,720
Oh, wait, no, it's just like that.

4716
03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:12,720
Okay, I was like, why does this look...

4717
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:14,060
Wait, is this the seam?

4718
03:09:14,660 --> 03:09:15,800
Oh, it's the seam.

4719
03:09:17,180 --> 03:09:17,680
Wait, what's happening?

4720
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:18,740
Hello?

4721
03:09:23,180 --> 03:09:23,580
Hello?

4722
03:09:24,640 --> 03:09:27,420
How are we supposed to know to go in here to do all of this?

4723
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:29,580
I don't know, there was no hints whatsoever.

4724
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:30,180
No.

4725
03:09:31,320 --> 03:09:33,940
Oh, I'm just gonna wear my clothes and just sit in there.

4726
03:09:34,020 --> 03:09:36,100
I'm definitely very depressed right now.

4727
03:09:40,560 --> 03:09:40,960
Daddy...

4728
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:42,820
It's not how daddy felt.

4729
03:09:42,940 --> 03:09:44,620
They're American ninja.

4730
03:09:44,840 --> 03:09:47,080
Let's try it out.

4731
03:09:52,340 --> 03:09:53,580
Bath time.

4732
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:56,640
Family bonding time.

4733
03:09:58,100 --> 03:09:59,380
We're making our own Oni-sen.

4734
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:01,080
Oni-sen?

4735
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:02,240
Wait, how do you pronounce it?

4736
03:10:02,240 --> 03:10:02,720
On-sen?

4737
03:10:16,210 --> 03:10:17,470
Oni-sen.

4738
03:10:20,300 --> 03:10:21,110
Oni-sen!

4739
03:10:24,190 --> 03:10:27,110
Hi, Lucy.

4740
03:10:28,690 --> 03:10:29,530
Lucy?

4741
03:10:31,770 --> 03:10:32,610
Lucy?

4742
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:35,850
Why does Lucy always look so freaky?

4743
03:10:38,090 --> 03:10:38,850
Oni-sen.

4744
03:10:42,790 --> 03:10:43,390
Oh.

4745
03:10:43,670 --> 03:10:45,090
I thought it was...

4746
03:10:45,090 --> 03:10:46,410
Is that Pico?

4747
03:10:47,390 --> 03:10:47,950
Pico!

4748
03:10:49,290 --> 03:10:49,890
Pico!

4749
03:10:51,430 --> 03:10:55,130
What did she do to Pico?

4750
03:10:55,990 --> 03:10:57,070
Did she free him?

4751
03:10:57,330 --> 03:10:58,250
Did she let him fly out?

4752
03:10:58,270 --> 03:10:58,950
She ate him.

4753
03:10:59,170 --> 03:11:03,090
She's never ate a bird before.

4754
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:10,470
We've turned into Bendy and the Ink Machine.

4755
03:11:12,330 --> 03:11:13,350
Have you ever played that game?

4756
03:11:14,410 --> 03:11:15,210
No, I've never played it.

4757
03:11:15,470 --> 03:11:16,230
It's fun.

4758
03:11:18,210 --> 03:11:20,250
Bendy and the Ink Machine 2 was not fun though.

4759
03:11:20,370 --> 03:11:21,270
It was not as fun.

4760
03:11:21,330 --> 03:11:22,650
Not as fun as the first one.

4761
03:11:23,490 --> 03:11:24,890
The first one had that novelty.

4762
03:11:25,550 --> 03:11:27,170
The second one was so fucked up.

4763
03:11:27,230 --> 03:11:29,450
There's like a jump scare ghost that literally...

4764
03:11:29,450 --> 03:11:31,310
Her entire mission is to just jump scare you.

4765
03:11:31,330 --> 03:11:33,050
You don't know when she'll ever pop up.

4766
03:11:33,250 --> 03:11:33,650
Ew!

4767
03:11:35,010 --> 03:11:36,590
Oh my god, I hated her.

4768
03:11:45,140 --> 03:11:46,080
Speak up, dad.

4769
03:11:46,460 --> 03:11:46,600
Yeah.

4770
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:48,380
Oh my god.

4771
03:11:53,080 --> 03:11:53,480
Oh...

4772
03:11:53,960 --> 03:11:55,040
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4773
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:56,180
Why not just give her pills?

4774
03:12:00,900 --> 03:12:02,580
Just be like they're happy needles.

4775
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:09,520
Oh...

4776
03:12:09,520 --> 03:12:10,860
It's supposed to be the end of the chapter, no?

4777
03:12:10,980 --> 03:12:12,140
We're getting all the lore now.

4778
03:12:12,260 --> 03:12:14,160
Yeah, we're learning about Lucy.

4779
03:12:14,820 --> 03:12:16,960
Yeah, why she gave us needles.

4780
03:12:17,400 --> 03:12:19,620
Yeah, and why her jaw is just ripped open.

4781
03:12:20,480 --> 03:12:21,520
I don't think we know that.

4782
03:12:28,180 --> 03:12:31,000
Did she go to those home remedy doctors?

4783
03:12:31,820 --> 03:12:32,480
Oh no!

4784
03:12:35,160 --> 03:12:35,560
Oh...

4785
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:37,140
Oh, that's so sad.

4786
03:12:37,140 --> 03:12:38,760
It's not their fault.

4787
03:12:41,880 --> 03:12:42,740
She's singing.

4788
03:12:42,980 --> 03:12:44,740
That's Bendy and the Ink Machine song.

4789
03:12:48,660 --> 03:12:49,180
Huh?

4790
03:12:51,020 --> 03:12:52,240
Oh, there's a bathtub.

4791
03:12:52,900 --> 03:12:53,320
A bathtub.

4792
03:12:56,720 --> 03:13:00,880
Lucy, are you ready to go to the Oni-sen with your dad?

4793
03:13:00,900 --> 03:13:01,600
Oni-sen?

4794
03:13:05,020 --> 03:13:06,140
Oh, it's blood.

4795
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:07,280
Now it's blood.

4796
03:13:08,260 --> 03:13:09,780
Oh, she's gonna definitely...

4797
03:13:09,780 --> 03:13:11,520
Yeah, she's gonna come out.

4798
03:13:11,620 --> 03:13:13,400
She's gonna be like...

4799
03:13:15,280 --> 03:13:16,240
Got you!

4800
03:13:17,160 --> 03:13:18,820
Alright, Lucy, come out!

4801
03:13:19,460 --> 03:13:20,800
No more playing into me.

4802
03:13:21,060 --> 03:13:22,660
I know the skunk got you good.

4803
03:13:22,740 --> 03:13:24,480
But come out of the tomato juice.

4804
03:13:25,280 --> 03:13:26,340
Wait, we're going in.

4805
03:13:26,480 --> 03:13:28,860
Oh my god, we're such a freak.

4806
03:13:29,640 --> 03:13:31,660
We got sprayed by a skunk.

4807
03:13:32,340 --> 03:13:33,860
Is she gonna come out of...

4808
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:36,220
Oh, she's gonna come out like Grudge.

4809
03:13:37,440 --> 03:13:38,380
He's whimpering.

4810
03:13:41,200 --> 03:13:43,140
He's gonna turn into...

4811
03:13:43,140 --> 03:13:44,560
Into Tomato Doki.

4812
03:13:45,260 --> 03:13:47,180
This is the metamorphosis.

4813
03:13:48,220 --> 03:13:49,340
The process.

4814
03:13:50,840 --> 03:13:52,240
Oh, did I try to...

4815
03:13:52,860 --> 03:13:54,100
What the fuck?

4816
03:13:55,920 --> 03:13:57,180
What a diaper.

4817
03:13:57,180 --> 03:13:58,140
Yes!

4818
03:14:07,060 --> 03:14:09,260
This is my origin story.

4819
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:11,600
I dunked myself in tomato juice...

4820
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:12,320
and became one.

4821
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:15,900
Oh no!

4822
03:14:18,040 --> 03:14:18,700
Oh?

4823
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:23,740
Oh, I'm Lucy now?

4824
03:14:24,220 --> 03:14:25,100
I'm Lucy?

4825
03:14:25,380 --> 03:14:26,800
Oh no, Lucy's over there.

4826
03:14:26,800 --> 03:14:27,480
I see her.

4827
03:14:28,700 --> 03:14:29,440
Is that her?

4828
03:14:29,640 --> 03:14:31,060
Yeah, she's over there.

4829
03:14:31,300 --> 03:14:31,700
Standing?

4830
03:14:32,320 --> 03:14:33,420
I don't think so.

4831
03:14:33,500 --> 03:14:34,240
No, that is her.

4832
03:14:34,320 --> 03:14:35,020
Oh, it is, you're right.

4833
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:41,220
Why is there blood on that?

4834
03:14:42,960 --> 03:14:43,780
Oh my god.

4835
03:14:43,960 --> 03:14:46,140
I know the voice said she didn't take her meds.

4836
03:14:48,720 --> 03:14:49,860
That's her best friend.

4837
03:14:51,980 --> 03:14:52,380
Oh!

4838
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:54,820
She ripped her own jaw?

4839
03:14:54,820 --> 03:14:54,940
What?

4840
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:57,960
Oh, Lucy's kind of metal.

4841
03:14:58,540 --> 03:15:00,260
Wait, this is pretty hardcore.

4842
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:01,320
Bro!

4843
03:15:01,980 --> 03:15:05,260
How does she have the strength to do that though?

4844
03:15:05,940 --> 03:15:06,460
Like...

4845
03:15:07,320 --> 03:15:10,480
Like, the upper body strength to rip open...

4846
03:15:10,480 --> 03:15:11,800
Like, how much does that even...

4847
03:15:11,800 --> 03:15:13,540
How much force do you need for that?

4848
03:15:13,620 --> 03:15:14,080
Right.

4849
03:15:14,380 --> 03:15:15,860
Oh, there's a tape and there's a...

4850
03:15:15,860 --> 03:15:17,080
Or not a cassette.

4851
03:15:17,300 --> 03:15:20,580
There's a VHS tape in the body.

4852
03:15:21,180 --> 03:15:21,560
Yeah.

4853
03:15:22,140 --> 03:15:22,540
Pride.

4854
03:15:23,140 --> 03:15:25,000
Alright, found a VHS tape.

4855
03:15:25,980 --> 03:15:28,180
Oh, cool, I got Lucy's jaw.

4856
03:15:28,480 --> 03:15:29,280
Progress item.

4857
03:15:29,540 --> 03:15:31,240
Oh, wait, I know what to do with this.

4858
03:15:32,320 --> 03:15:33,220
Uh, it disappeared.

4859
03:15:33,360 --> 03:15:34,320
That's what you do with it.

4860
03:15:34,860 --> 03:15:35,860
We did it!

4861
03:15:37,300 --> 03:15:38,600
We made progress!

4862
03:15:41,480 --> 03:15:42,280
We did!

4863
03:15:42,360 --> 03:15:43,420
That wasn't so bad.

4864
03:15:44,600 --> 03:15:44,900
Alright.

4865
03:15:45,360 --> 03:15:47,220
I'm not doing the next chapter right now, I can't.

4866
03:15:47,820 --> 03:15:48,820
No, I think we're good.

4867
03:15:48,820 --> 03:15:51,240
I think I'm okay.

4868
03:15:51,500 --> 03:15:52,880
Wait, go into the light.

4869
03:15:53,020 --> 03:15:54,260
Avoid standing in the dark.

4870
03:15:54,660 --> 03:15:57,020
I need to put the progress item.

4871
03:15:57,620 --> 03:15:58,740
No, I think it already went.

4872
03:15:58,820 --> 03:15:59,180
It disappeared.

4873
03:16:00,340 --> 03:16:01,220
Do I?

4874
03:16:01,420 --> 03:16:03,900
Yeah, I wanna see her jaw.

4875
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:05,540
My little memento.

4876
03:16:06,260 --> 03:16:08,620
I say as I'm not a serial killer.

4877
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:13,080
My little memento.

4878
03:16:13,380 --> 03:16:16,160
I keep a little memento for every...

4879
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:17,720
Oh, it is here, look.

4880
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:20,600
Yeah, not creepy at all.

4881
03:16:23,540 --> 03:16:25,460
The virgin Mary looking on.

4882
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:28,520
Is this my little confessional box?

4883
03:16:28,540 --> 03:16:29,360
Yeah, it's a confessional.

4884
03:16:29,620 --> 03:16:32,240
A miniature confessional?

4885
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:33,740
In my house?

4886
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:36,920
Oh my god, I bought a miniature confession box.

4887
03:16:39,380 --> 03:16:40,620
Wait, I'll show you a picture.

4888
03:16:40,620 --> 03:16:41,220
Wait, can I?

4889
03:16:41,420 --> 03:16:42,640
Wait, what?

4890
03:16:43,180 --> 03:16:46,400
I went to this...

4891
03:16:46,400 --> 03:16:47,440
I forgot what it's called.

4892
03:16:47,720 --> 03:16:49,560
You Americans have something similar.

4893
03:16:49,920 --> 03:16:52,520
I have this shop called London Drugs.

4894
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:54,680
And they sell these little...

4895
03:16:54,680 --> 03:16:57,080
Small bookshelf items.

4896
03:16:57,520 --> 03:17:00,060
And one of them was a tiny-ass confessional booth.

4897
03:17:00,460 --> 03:17:04,280
I thought it was so fucking silly.

4898
03:17:04,740 --> 03:17:06,480
But the one I bought was...

4899
03:17:07,340 --> 03:17:08,800
Faulty, so I had to go back.

4900
03:17:08,800 --> 03:17:11,200
Because my chat donated me money to go back.

4901
03:17:11,400 --> 03:17:13,620
And buy a functioning confessional box.

4902
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,560
Because a working one...

4903
03:17:15,560 --> 03:17:17,880
When you press it, it will say...

4904
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:18,720
You are forgiven.

4905
03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:24,080
So you confess to it.

4906
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:26,100
And then you'll be like...

4907
03:17:26,100 --> 03:17:27,680
You are forgiven.

4908
03:17:28,140 --> 03:17:29,000
Desktop confessional.

4909
03:17:33,560 --> 03:17:36,100
I'll show you what it looks like.

4910
03:17:36,420 --> 03:17:37,860
Oh my god.

4911
03:17:37,860 --> 03:17:38,500
What?

4912
03:17:39,100 --> 03:17:41,560
You should put a little anime figure in it.

4913
03:17:43,040 --> 03:17:45,560
And then you press the bench.

4914
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:47,200
And when you press it, it will light up.

4915
03:17:47,360 --> 03:17:49,020
And then you say something to it.

4916
03:17:49,060 --> 03:17:50,880
And it will be like, you are forgiven.

4917
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,120
Does it record what you say?

4918
03:17:54,320 --> 03:17:54,820
No, no.

4919
03:17:55,600 --> 03:17:56,440
It's just...

4920
03:17:57,220 --> 03:17:59,140
Instead of going to actual church...

4921
03:17:59,140 --> 03:18:00,840
You can just confess to your...

4922
03:18:00,840 --> 03:18:02,940
Desktop confessional.

4923
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:06,080
So my sins will be forgiven.

4924
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:06,920
You know?

4925
03:18:07,100 --> 03:18:10,540
It's just a little convenient way to commit sin.

4926
03:18:10,880 --> 03:18:12,560
And be forgiven for it.

4927
03:18:12,620 --> 03:18:13,700
And be forgiven on the go.

4928
03:18:13,860 --> 03:18:15,800
Yeah, be forgiven on the go.

4929
03:18:15,960 --> 03:18:17,240
That's such good marketing.

4930
03:18:17,720 --> 03:18:18,100
You know?

4931
03:18:18,580 --> 03:18:20,680
You did something wrong and you're like...

4932
03:18:20,680 --> 03:18:22,700
Oh man, it's not Sunday yet.

4933
03:18:22,820 --> 03:18:24,060
Oh man, it's Monday.

4934
03:18:24,520 --> 03:18:26,280
I can't go to church right now.

4935
03:18:27,960 --> 03:18:29,860
You just finished jorking it.

4936
03:18:29,980 --> 03:18:31,180
And you don't even say anything.

4937
03:18:31,280 --> 03:18:32,460
You just press the bench.

4938
03:18:35,720 --> 03:18:36,520
You're like...

4939
03:18:37,040 --> 03:18:38,140
You saw something.

4940
03:18:38,320 --> 03:18:41,020
You jorked it to something that you shouldn't have.

4941
03:18:41,420 --> 03:18:43,060
And then you press the bench.

4942
03:18:43,100 --> 03:18:44,320
It's like, you are forgiven.

4943
03:18:50,680 --> 03:18:51,480
No way.

4944
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:54,860
Alright, for those who haven't...

4945
03:18:54,860 --> 03:18:56,620
Newer viewers who are like...

4946
03:18:56,620 --> 03:18:57,140
Oh my gosh.

4947
03:18:57,220 --> 03:18:58,280
Okay, I'll show you guys a picture.

4948
03:18:59,180 --> 03:18:59,580
My...

4949
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:02,820
Some of my Dragoons have already seen it.

4950
03:19:02,840 --> 03:19:03,620
Because I showed it before.

4951
03:19:03,640 --> 03:19:04,400
This is insane.

4952
03:19:04,400 --> 03:19:05,500
This is actually...

4953
03:19:05,500 --> 03:19:06,320
Yeah.

4954
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:09,040
So it's...

4955
03:19:09,040 --> 03:19:12,600
My miniature desktop confessional.

4956
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:14,300
And it literally is like...

4957
03:19:14,300 --> 03:19:15,720
All it does is...

4958
03:19:15,720 --> 03:19:18,220
It will say they'll forgive me for my sins.

4959
03:19:18,560 --> 03:19:20,680
I have to go back and buy another one.

4960
03:19:20,720 --> 03:19:22,060
Because this one doesn't work.

4961
03:19:22,320 --> 03:19:23,140
It lights up.

4962
03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:24,540
It just doesn't forgive me.

4963
03:19:24,920 --> 03:19:26,820
It doesn't...

4964
03:19:26,820 --> 03:19:28,540
It just doesn't...

4965
03:19:28,540 --> 03:19:29,460
Forgive me.

4966
03:19:30,500 --> 03:19:32,420
It's like, tell me your sins.

4967
03:19:32,420 --> 03:19:33,540
It doesn't forgive...

4968
03:19:33,540 --> 03:19:34,960
Wait, does it not need like...

4969
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:37,180
Does it have one of those things you have to pull out?

4970
03:19:37,520 --> 03:19:39,280
No, apparently like...

4971
03:19:39,280 --> 03:19:41,620
There's a chance for you to get a faulty one.

4972
03:19:41,960 --> 03:19:45,060
So I literally bought a one that didn't work.

4973
03:19:45,620 --> 03:19:47,000
And then my chat was like...

4974
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,480
Your sins were too heavy to be forgiven.

4975
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:50,300
I was gonna say.

4976
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:52,820
And then I love how it's like...

4977
03:19:52,820 --> 03:19:54,500
For ages 14 and up.

4978
03:19:54,580 --> 03:19:57,100
So if you're 13, you will never be forgiven.

4979
03:19:58,240 --> 03:20:00,580
No, you can't have sins then, I guess.

4980
03:20:00,580 --> 03:20:01,760
Oh, maybe you're right.

4981
03:20:01,920 --> 03:20:04,980
Sins only start when you're 14.

4982
03:20:05,240 --> 03:20:06,720
So you get like a...

4983
03:20:06,720 --> 03:20:08,320
You know how like...

4984
03:20:08,320 --> 03:20:11,440
Children who murder don't go to actual jail.

4985
03:20:11,560 --> 03:20:12,960
They go to juvenile jail.

4986
03:20:13,440 --> 03:20:14,680
So like...

4987
03:20:14,680 --> 03:20:15,920
And then when they're...

4988
03:20:16,580 --> 03:20:18,340
Because they're like older kids.

4989
03:20:18,900 --> 03:20:20,760
Maybe they'll grow out of it.

4990
03:20:21,260 --> 03:20:22,980
The description is insane.

4991
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:29,000
This mini confessional booth features a light up screen, pressure activated kneeler, and a holy voice.

4992
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:34,920
That prompts you to share your sins before offering a comforting...

4993
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:35,780
You are forgiven.

4994
03:20:36,560 --> 03:20:39,110
That's what... I guess I wanted to be comforted.

4995
03:20:39,860 --> 03:20:41,840
But it didn't comfort me.

4996
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:43,460
There was no voice.

4997
03:20:43,540 --> 03:20:43,580
Wait, what's the...

4998
03:20:43,580 --> 03:20:47,480
The actual audacity of saying...

4999
03:20:47,480 --> 03:20:50,640
We'll teach you the etiquette of entering the confessional.

5000
03:20:50,940 --> 03:20:54,860
When they're selling the most black mirror-esque lighting.

5001
03:20:56,260 --> 03:20:58,500
And then this is what it looks like, chat.

5002
03:20:58,880 --> 03:21:02,820
You see my screwdriver because I was trying to figure out how to fix it.

5003
03:21:03,300 --> 03:21:05,000
But it was already broken.

5004
03:21:05,240 --> 03:21:06,440
So you see like...

5005
03:21:06,440 --> 03:21:07,400
And then like...

5006
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:09,680
When you go in, you press the bench.

5007
03:21:09,820 --> 03:21:11,560
And then in the bench...

5008
03:21:11,560 --> 03:21:13,280
Wait, let's see where's the other picture.

5009
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:16,020
In the bench, like...

5010
03:21:16,580 --> 03:21:17,720
This lights up.

5011
03:21:17,780 --> 03:21:20,040
Like the wind over there lights up basically.

5012
03:21:25,680 --> 03:21:28,160
Oh my god.

5013
03:21:28,500 --> 03:21:30,600
Who's supposed to be on the other side?

5014
03:21:31,720 --> 03:21:32,460
That's god.

5015
03:21:32,660 --> 03:21:33,500
That's mini god.

5016
03:21:34,080 --> 03:21:35,060
Miniature god.

5017
03:21:35,380 --> 03:21:36,480
Miniature priest.

5018
03:21:37,440 --> 03:21:38,920
That's pocket god.

5019
03:21:39,040 --> 03:21:40,980
Yeah, there's a pocket god in there.

5020
03:21:45,460 --> 03:21:47,660
Honestly, the best purchase of my life.

5021
03:21:47,780 --> 03:21:48,140
Honestly.

5022
03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:51,600
I could see...

5023
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:52,700
I could really see though.

5024
03:21:52,700 --> 03:21:54,280
Like some old lady having this.

5025
03:21:54,740 --> 03:21:55,260
Unironically.

5026
03:21:56,120 --> 03:21:57,960
And it's like, oh heavens.

5027
03:21:58,080 --> 03:21:58,720
I got it.

5028
03:21:59,520 --> 03:22:00,860
I want one.

5029
03:22:02,460 --> 03:22:03,800
It's so good.

5030
03:22:06,900 --> 03:22:09,520
You know when god is on his day off.

5031
03:22:09,620 --> 03:22:11,720
So you bring out the miniature confessional.

5032
03:22:13,820 --> 03:22:15,980
Confess on the go, you know.

5033
03:22:18,480 --> 03:22:21,680
That can be like a ritual at the end of every stream.

5034
03:22:22,700 --> 03:22:24,280
God is like, alright dragoons.

5035
03:22:24,460 --> 03:22:25,700
Let's confess.

5036
03:22:25,860 --> 03:22:28,880
And then a holy voice goes, you are forgiven.

5037
03:22:38,530 --> 03:22:40,810
Just before I end every stream.

5038
03:22:41,670 --> 03:22:44,150
That's my goodbye spiel.

5039
03:22:48,350 --> 03:22:49,990
Get up and move around.

5040
03:22:50,490 --> 03:22:52,950
Instead of just being like, you are forgiven.

5041
03:22:54,610 --> 03:22:55,430
Oh my god.

5042
03:22:55,470 --> 03:22:56,570
You know how like...

5043
03:22:56,570 --> 03:22:59,450
You know how some priests do like...

5044
03:22:59,450 --> 03:23:01,750
Do like church live streams now.

5045
03:23:02,610 --> 03:23:03,270
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

5046
03:23:03,290 --> 03:23:03,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5047
03:23:03,950 --> 03:23:04,850
And there's like...

5048
03:23:04,850 --> 03:23:05,550
What are they called?

5049
03:23:07,450 --> 03:23:10,370
You know like the ones that do like...

5050
03:23:10,370 --> 03:23:11,450
Like church on the TV.

5051
03:23:11,750 --> 03:23:13,550
And then they are like millionaire priests.

5052
03:23:13,910 --> 03:23:14,710
What are they called again?

5053
03:23:15,350 --> 03:23:17,890
Yeah, but there's a name for them.

5054
03:23:17,990 --> 03:23:18,770
What are they called again?

5055
03:23:19,670 --> 03:23:20,970
Is it not a church?

5056
03:23:22,090 --> 03:23:23,050
Oh, televangelist.

5057
03:23:23,070 --> 03:23:24,230
Yeah, televangelist.

5058
03:23:24,570 --> 03:23:26,750
Apparently they are now doing stream services.

5059
03:23:27,270 --> 03:23:28,210
So like...

5060
03:23:28,550 --> 03:23:30,150
So they are like, thank you for the...

5061
03:23:30,150 --> 03:23:31,510
Thank you for the super chat.

5062
03:23:32,250 --> 03:23:33,210
Miss Grayson.

5063
03:23:36,290 --> 03:23:37,970
I'm just thinking like...

5064
03:23:37,970 --> 03:23:39,930
How do they thank super chats, you know?

5065
03:23:40,430 --> 03:23:41,970
May god be with you.

5066
03:23:42,090 --> 03:23:43,470
Thank you for the super chat.

5067
03:23:43,670 --> 03:23:44,030
Thank you.

5068
03:23:45,210 --> 03:23:45,890
Thank you.

5069
03:23:45,890 --> 03:23:46,650
They have like...

5070
03:23:46,650 --> 03:23:49,130
They also have like a little sound alert that plays.

5071
03:23:49,510 --> 03:23:50,990
Oh yeah, like at the choir.

5072
03:23:51,610 --> 03:23:52,710
You are forgiven.

5073
03:23:53,010 --> 03:23:55,870
Like a choir being like...

5074
03:24:00,670 --> 03:24:04,390
Thank you my children for 1 million subscribers.

5075
03:24:09,630 --> 03:24:13,430
Today we got our coveted YouTube play button.

5076
03:24:14,670 --> 03:24:16,330
YouTube play button.

5077
03:24:21,590 --> 03:24:23,230
YouTube play button.

5078
03:24:24,690 --> 03:24:27,550
Yeah, if it's on Twitch, everyone will just be like...

5079
03:24:27,550 --> 03:24:28,550
Praise, praise, praise.

5080
03:24:32,530 --> 03:24:33,390
Praise, praise.

5081
03:24:35,070 --> 03:24:38,250
Can we get a hallelujah sticker in the chat?

5082
03:24:38,510 --> 03:24:39,050
Yeah, yeah.

5083
03:24:39,050 --> 03:24:41,810
Can we get some hallelujahs in the chat real quick, guys?

5084
03:24:41,970 --> 03:24:44,430
Thank you for the sub.

5085
03:24:44,430 --> 03:24:45,870
Thank you, thank you.

5086
03:24:45,950 --> 03:24:47,790
Some hallelujahs in the chat.

5087
03:24:49,570 --> 03:24:51,630
May god be with you.

5088
03:24:51,890 --> 03:24:53,130
No, they're not a sub.

5089
03:24:53,350 --> 03:24:56,370
They're a number of month devotee.

5090
03:24:56,470 --> 03:24:57,390
Oh, you're right.

5091
03:24:57,510 --> 03:24:58,790
Thank you for...

5092
03:25:00,730 --> 03:25:03,710
Thank you for being a devotee for five months.

5093
03:25:03,890 --> 03:25:04,090
Thank you.

5094
03:25:06,710 --> 03:25:08,410
Praise, praise, praise.

5095
03:25:08,550 --> 03:25:09,350
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

5096
03:25:10,610 --> 03:25:12,650
One dollar equals one redemption.

5097
03:25:12,650 --> 03:25:13,850
Hallelujah.

5098
03:25:14,190 --> 03:25:16,750
And then just imagine the TTS.

5099
03:25:18,950 --> 03:25:21,470
And it would be like...

5100
03:25:21,470 --> 03:25:23,310
It would be something like...

5101
03:25:23,310 --> 03:25:25,110
How do I send this?

5102
03:25:25,230 --> 03:25:26,350
Love, Grandma Jo.

5103
03:25:31,220 --> 03:25:33,640
My son, help me send this.

5104
03:25:38,160 --> 03:25:40,580
I have a question, father.

5105
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:47,960
Oh my god.

5106
03:25:48,200 --> 03:25:49,440
Praise, praise, praise.

5107
03:25:49,720 --> 03:25:50,880
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

5108
03:25:55,380 --> 03:25:59,720
Someone's like, I don't know who deserves to go to hell more right now.

5109
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:00,740
What do you mean?

5110
03:26:07,980 --> 03:26:11,000
We're just coming up with the next stream meta, you know?

5111
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:14,980
We're just coming up with...

5112
03:26:14,980 --> 03:26:16,800
I have an excuse, I'm drunk, I don't know.

5113
03:26:20,160 --> 03:26:21,680
Well, you're not drunk.

5114
03:26:21,840 --> 03:26:22,580
Yes, I am.

5115
03:26:22,680 --> 03:26:25,860
I finished almost an entire bottle of soju.

5116
03:26:26,480 --> 03:26:27,280
You're still coherent.

5117
03:26:27,760 --> 03:26:28,860
That's true, I am.

5118
03:26:28,880 --> 03:26:29,720
I'm still coherent.

5119
03:26:30,040 --> 03:26:33,580
I feel like if I downed the whole thing, it would have been over.

5120
03:26:33,780 --> 03:26:36,300
I also like peed too, so...

5121
03:26:36,900 --> 03:26:39,620
I like peed out some of it out of my system.

5122
03:26:39,620 --> 03:26:41,740
You sprayed the alcohol away.

5123
03:26:42,580 --> 03:26:43,000
Yeah.

5124
03:26:43,180 --> 03:26:45,840
I balance it with water too, so I don't get like...

5125
03:26:45,840 --> 03:26:49,540
If I really want to get fucked up, I just don't drink water.

5126
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:52,220
But that's not a good idea to do on stream.

5127
03:26:53,100 --> 03:26:53,580
Because...

5128
03:26:54,820 --> 03:26:57,660
I don't know what I'm going to say on stream.

5129
03:26:58,140 --> 03:27:01,420
I might go full drunk on drunk.

5130
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:03,500
But I am drunk, though.

5131
03:27:03,540 --> 03:27:05,620
I am drunk, I'm just not...

5132
03:27:07,080 --> 03:27:07,560
Wasted.

5133
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:08,880
I'm not wasted.

5134
03:27:09,580 --> 03:27:10,260
Okay.

5135
03:27:10,440 --> 03:27:11,640
You seem the same.

5136
03:27:12,640 --> 03:27:15,880
Are you usually like...

5137
03:27:15,880 --> 03:27:17,320
What kind of drunk are you?

5138
03:27:17,700 --> 03:27:19,200
I'm like...

5139
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:20,260
I don't...

5140
03:27:20,260 --> 03:27:23,560
I remember in university...

5141
03:27:25,060 --> 03:27:28,360
You know how the legal drinking age...

5142
03:27:28,360 --> 03:27:29,880
In the US is like...

5143
03:27:30,980 --> 03:27:32,320
21, right?

5144
03:27:32,660 --> 03:27:33,260
Yeah, 21.

5145
03:27:33,660 --> 03:27:35,880
But in Canada, it's like 18.

5146
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:38,480
So like...

5147
03:27:38,480 --> 03:27:39,520
Or 19, I don't remember.

5148
03:27:40,220 --> 03:27:41,540
I think it's 18, right?

5149
03:27:41,720 --> 03:27:42,240
I don't remember.

5150
03:27:42,420 --> 03:27:44,120
I know I'm Canadian, but like...

5151
03:27:46,140 --> 03:27:47,460
I like how people are like...

5152
03:27:47,460 --> 03:27:47,880
21!

5153
03:27:48,120 --> 03:27:50,180
Yeah, no, America's drinking age is 21.

5154
03:27:50,740 --> 03:27:51,680
I know like in some...

5155
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:53,780
Some provinces it's 18 and others are 19.

5156
03:27:55,620 --> 03:27:56,500
But like...

5157
03:27:56,500 --> 03:27:59,380
I had to go to New York.

5158
03:28:00,440 --> 03:28:01,780
For something for university.

5159
03:28:02,400 --> 03:28:03,180
And then like...

5160
03:28:03,180 --> 03:28:05,220
The thing is, obviously, I'm like...

5161
03:28:05,220 --> 03:28:06,460
Not 21 at that time.

5162
03:28:07,480 --> 03:28:08,020
Right.

5163
03:28:08,500 --> 03:28:11,320
So we had to get like the upperclassmen...

5164
03:28:11,320 --> 03:28:13,300
To like buy us alcohol and stuff.

5165
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:14,860
And then like...

5166
03:28:15,540 --> 03:28:17,440
I haven't got drunk before.

5167
03:28:17,460 --> 03:28:19,080
I haven't drank before or anything.

5168
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:21,180
So like, our teacher chaperone...

5169
03:28:22,140 --> 03:28:23,120
Bought us wine.

5170
03:28:25,660 --> 03:28:27,540
She bought us wine at first.

5171
03:28:27,560 --> 03:28:28,400
Wine is fine.

5172
03:28:28,480 --> 03:28:31,000
But then like, I took like...

5173
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:32,660
Two sips and then they were like...

5174
03:28:32,660 --> 03:28:33,640
You're red, Doki.

5175
03:28:33,860 --> 03:28:35,320
And they're like, no more for you.

5176
03:28:35,560 --> 03:28:36,200
No, really?

5177
03:28:36,820 --> 03:28:40,680
They took the cup away.

5178
03:28:41,080 --> 03:28:42,860
And then later on, there was a party.

5179
03:28:43,360 --> 03:28:44,360
For the students.

5180
03:28:44,360 --> 03:28:46,480
From all other schools to get in New York.

5181
03:28:46,880 --> 03:28:47,780
So there was a party.

5182
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:49,100
And then like...

5183
03:28:49,100 --> 03:28:52,520
My classmates, they made me my very first drink.

5184
03:28:52,540 --> 03:28:53,260
Which was a screwdriver.

5185
03:28:55,400 --> 03:28:56,480
And then when I...

5186
03:28:56,480 --> 03:28:58,200
Obviously, I didn't know how to drink.

5187
03:28:58,200 --> 03:29:00,280
Because it was the first time I ever drank.

5188
03:29:00,620 --> 03:29:01,460
And got drunk.

5189
03:29:02,060 --> 03:29:04,540
And then they were like...

5190
03:29:04,540 --> 03:29:05,700
They were like...

5191
03:29:05,700 --> 03:29:07,060
You're more funny when you're drunk.

5192
03:29:07,100 --> 03:29:08,300
Here, have some more.

5193
03:29:10,020 --> 03:29:11,280
I'll make you more.

5194
03:29:11,740 --> 03:29:13,080
And then like...

5195
03:29:13,080 --> 03:29:15,920
I had a meeting with somebody.

5196
03:29:16,120 --> 03:29:17,740
Outside of the hotel room.

5197
03:29:18,220 --> 03:29:19,940
So I had to go meet up with them.

5198
03:29:19,980 --> 03:29:20,820
For an assignment.

5199
03:29:21,520 --> 03:29:24,080
And then I was walking around.

5200
03:29:24,200 --> 03:29:25,460
With my screwdriver.

5201
03:29:25,460 --> 03:29:27,240
Out in the open.

5202
03:29:27,380 --> 03:29:29,660
Because apparently, that's a crime.

5203
03:29:29,860 --> 03:29:30,440
In America.

5204
03:29:30,920 --> 03:29:32,800
To walk around with alcohol.

5205
03:29:33,540 --> 03:29:35,500
Like, just...

5206
03:29:35,500 --> 03:29:37,440
Yeah, I have something to say.

5207
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:38,160
Yeah.

5208
03:29:39,820 --> 03:29:40,860
You are forgiven.

5209
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:42,680
You are forgiven.

5210
03:29:46,460 --> 03:29:49,440
And then, like, my friends were like...

5211
03:29:49,440 --> 03:29:51,200
What the fuck were you doing?

5212
03:29:51,960 --> 03:29:53,460
You could actually...

5213
03:29:53,460 --> 03:29:54,500
You could actually get arrested.

5214
03:29:54,860 --> 03:29:55,540
For like...

5215
03:29:55,540 --> 03:29:58,560
For holding out.

5216
03:29:58,620 --> 03:29:59,820
I just realized.

5217
03:30:00,060 --> 03:30:02,760
People put paper bags on the alcohol.

5218
03:30:03,200 --> 03:30:04,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5219
03:30:04,700 --> 03:30:06,820
Because you're not supposed to walk around.

5220
03:30:08,160 --> 03:30:10,020
I've never thought about that.

5221
03:30:10,180 --> 03:30:11,640
Because I think of Japan.

5222
03:30:12,060 --> 03:30:13,700
Where you can walk with...

5223
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:15,440
Open...

5224
03:30:15,440 --> 03:30:16,760
Containers.

5225
03:30:16,940 --> 03:30:18,640
Yeah, but apparently in America.

5226
03:30:18,960 --> 03:30:20,600
You cannot do that.

5227
03:30:20,600 --> 03:30:21,780
Yeah, the brown paper bag.

5228
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:23,400
You can't drink out in public.

5229
03:30:23,560 --> 03:30:26,120
And it has to be in a brown paper bag if it is.

5230
03:30:26,500 --> 03:30:28,160
But you're not supposed to show...

5231
03:30:28,160 --> 03:30:30,380
You can't have alcohol in public and stuff.

5232
03:30:30,800 --> 03:30:32,220
But yeah, apparently I'm just like...

5233
03:30:32,220 --> 03:30:34,000
I'm just like more talkative.

5234
03:30:34,120 --> 03:30:35,220
And more funny or something.

5235
03:30:35,500 --> 03:30:36,740
Because you're like, oh my god, Doki.

5236
03:30:36,820 --> 03:30:37,720
You need to drink more.

5237
03:30:37,900 --> 03:30:40,760
They just kept making me screwdrivers.

5238
03:30:41,780 --> 03:30:42,800
Did you throw up?

5239
03:30:43,260 --> 03:30:43,760
No, no.

5240
03:30:43,820 --> 03:30:47,140
I don't know why.

5241
03:30:47,140 --> 03:30:48,720
I think I read up on it.

5242
03:30:48,820 --> 03:30:50,920
You know, like researched my way about drinking.

5243
03:30:53,300 --> 03:30:54,980
I've always like...

5244
03:30:54,980 --> 03:30:56,020
Balanced it with water.

5245
03:30:56,160 --> 03:30:58,140
But I've never thrown up before while drinking.

5246
03:30:58,520 --> 03:31:00,700
I've never got a hangover.

5247
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:03,500
And I've never like...

5248
03:31:03,500 --> 03:31:04,260
Thrown up before.

5249
03:31:06,240 --> 03:31:06,760
Well...

5250
03:31:06,760 --> 03:31:07,980
There's too much for everything.

5251
03:31:08,160 --> 03:31:09,160
Drink, drink, drink.

5252
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:13,340
Live on stream.

5253
03:31:13,440 --> 03:31:14,200
Drink, drink.

5254
03:31:14,200 --> 03:31:15,920
Wait, did you throw up on stream?

5255
03:31:16,700 --> 03:31:18,020
I've thrown up on stream.

5256
03:31:18,260 --> 03:31:19,900
Wait, multiple times?

5257
03:31:21,820 --> 03:31:24,580
I like how you had to think about it.

5258
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:26,100
I was like, did I?

5259
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:29,100
I throw up easily sometimes.

5260
03:31:29,680 --> 03:31:31,240
I've never done that before.

5261
03:31:32,040 --> 03:31:33,600
I think like, I remember.

5262
03:31:33,940 --> 03:31:35,160
It was like...

5263
03:31:35,160 --> 03:31:36,960
I almost did.

5264
03:31:37,100 --> 03:31:39,200
And I think it was the same reason you did.

5265
03:31:39,440 --> 03:31:40,860
It was the...

5266
03:31:40,860 --> 03:31:41,400
What was it?

5267
03:31:41,800 --> 03:31:44,180
The switch.

5268
03:31:44,480 --> 03:31:46,540
The exercise game on the switch.

5269
03:31:47,080 --> 03:31:47,860
Oh, yeah!

5270
03:31:48,580 --> 03:31:50,520
I ate before as well.

5271
03:31:53,200 --> 03:31:54,600
I almost...

5272
03:31:54,600 --> 03:31:55,500
I almost did.

5273
03:31:55,620 --> 03:31:57,940
I remember it hit you, right?

5274
03:32:00,160 --> 03:32:01,260
Ring Fit.

5275
03:32:01,860 --> 03:32:05,440
I was like...

5276
03:32:05,440 --> 03:32:07,320
I waited two hours.

5277
03:32:07,320 --> 03:32:09,480
I was like, that's enough time to digest, right?

5278
03:32:09,780 --> 03:32:10,660
It was not.

5279
03:32:10,760 --> 03:32:13,120
Two hours is not enough time for your stomach to digest food.

5280
03:32:13,420 --> 03:32:14,560
I learned that the hard way.

5281
03:32:14,960 --> 03:32:15,660
No, it was not.

5282
03:32:15,740 --> 03:32:18,160
I waited two hours and I was not okay.

5283
03:32:18,540 --> 03:32:20,920
I was not okay.

5284
03:32:22,640 --> 03:32:23,400
Okay, Doki.

5285
03:32:23,500 --> 03:32:27,480
I'm gonna leave you now to sober up with your chat.

5286
03:32:27,760 --> 03:32:29,100
Alright, alright, alright.

5287
03:32:30,120 --> 03:32:31,640
I got some stuff to do.

5288
03:32:32,260 --> 03:32:33,020
Oh, yeah.

5289
03:32:33,060 --> 03:32:34,200
You're super busy.

5290
03:32:34,200 --> 03:32:35,440
I know that.

5291
03:32:36,220 --> 03:32:36,620
Yeah.

5292
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:39,360
You guys don't know.

5293
03:32:40,280 --> 03:32:42,280
We'll do the other chapters too.

5294
03:32:42,320 --> 03:32:42,900
Yeah, yeah.

5295
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:43,620
Next week, right?

5296
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:45,120
Yeah, next week.

5297
03:32:45,200 --> 03:32:45,700
We can do next week.

5298
03:32:45,860 --> 03:32:47,400
Alright, we'll do it next week, guys.

5299
03:32:47,460 --> 03:32:48,800
We'll do chapter 2 next week.

5300
03:32:48,880 --> 03:32:49,820
Alright, thanks, Mint.

5301
03:32:49,860 --> 03:32:51,000
Thanks for joining me.

5302
03:32:51,840 --> 03:32:53,300
Yeah, thanks, everybody.

5303
03:32:54,120 --> 03:32:56,000
Say bye-bye to Mint, guys.

5304
03:32:56,200 --> 03:32:56,780
Bye-bye.

5305
03:32:56,860 --> 03:32:58,440
Bye-bye, Mint Kitty.

5306
03:32:59,720 --> 03:33:02,000
We'll take her out to the back of the farm.

5307
03:33:03,480 --> 03:33:05,220
Where she'll get lots of nice treats.

5308
03:33:05,380 --> 03:33:06,060
Right, guys?

5309
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:10,280
Have you ever been to the back of the farm?

5310
03:33:10,900 --> 03:33:11,140
Mint Kitty?

5311
03:33:11,420 --> 03:33:12,200
I'm going now.

5312
03:33:12,260 --> 03:33:12,700
Yeah.

5313
03:33:13,780 --> 03:33:16,660
Yeah, bye-bye.

5314
03:33:17,220 --> 03:33:17,820
Bye-bye.

5315
03:33:22,260 --> 03:33:24,160
Okay, that was fun.

5316
03:33:24,340 --> 03:33:25,440
Okay, that was not fun.

5317
03:33:26,080 --> 03:33:28,040
It was a horror game, guys.

5318
03:33:32,300 --> 03:33:41,980
Huge thank you to Mint for coming here to, like, to, like, keep me company and help me with the puzzles.

5319
03:33:42,420 --> 03:33:50,520
I think this game would have taken a lot longer if Mint wasn't here to guide me through everything because I was so fucking scared.

5320
03:33:52,920 --> 03:33:55,760
But misery loves company, as you guys know.

5321
03:33:55,880 --> 03:33:56,220
But, yeah!

5322
03:33:56,460 --> 03:33:58,280
I do hope you guys enjoyed today's stream.

5323
03:33:58,380 --> 03:34:06,700
I am going to be doing a 2.5 Marvel Rivals stream on Twitch to finish up my quota because I have 2.5 hours left, apparently.

5324
03:34:06,860 --> 03:34:07,700
I was like, hey!

5325
03:34:07,800 --> 03:34:09,740
I was to the staff.

5326
03:34:09,860 --> 03:34:10,680
I was like, how many hours left?

5327
03:34:10,760 --> 03:34:11,960
And they were like, 2.5 hours.

5328
03:34:11,960 --> 03:34:12,660
I was like, fuck!

5329
03:34:12,800 --> 03:34:13,860
I thought I finished it.

5330
03:34:14,100 --> 03:34:16,360
So the pain never ends.

5331
03:34:16,720 --> 03:34:17,460
The pain...

5332
03:34:18,860 --> 03:34:19,660
never ends.

5333
03:34:23,240 --> 03:34:24,800
I might just do a quick...

5334
03:34:24,800 --> 03:34:25,620
Oh my god.

5335
03:34:25,700 --> 03:34:27,480
Wait, I didn't even know she has that expression.

5336
03:34:29,460 --> 03:34:30,780
I didn't even know that.

5337
03:34:30,780 --> 03:34:33,080
But, um...

5338
03:34:33,080 --> 03:34:33,740
What was I saying?

5339
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:43,260
I'm not gonna do rank because, like, um, because, you know, I'm pretty sure there's some people that are still trying to get top 500 right now.

5340
03:34:43,420 --> 03:34:46,220
And it would be really fucked up if I...

5341
03:34:46,780 --> 03:34:55,900
I am the deciding... I am the deciding teammate in their games on whether or not they get there.

5342
03:34:56,260 --> 03:34:58,280
I am the death sentence.

5343
03:34:58,280 --> 03:35:04,060
No, I've... I've terrorized enough players the last week already.

5344
03:35:04,280 --> 03:35:05,740
So, like, I...

5345
03:35:06,920 --> 03:35:10,340
I've terrorized enough people in the last week.

5346
03:35:10,600 --> 03:35:13,340
So, I will spare them.

5347
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:17,580
I got... Oh my god, I got yelled at by some fucking one of me pros.

5348
03:35:17,760 --> 03:35:21,060
And then, um, they were like, who are you?

5349
03:35:21,080 --> 03:35:25,440
You are... And then I looked them up, and oh my god, I am friends with their boss.

5350
03:35:25,440 --> 03:35:26,120
So...

5351
03:35:26,120 --> 03:35:34,500
I was like, I could literally message their boss right now and, like, just send them the screenshots.

5352
03:35:37,160 --> 03:35:44,340
And, like, a fucking clip of, like, their fucking garbage human behavior.

5353
03:35:47,700 --> 03:35:53,420
And then they're like, um, they're like, you are fucking terrible.

5354
03:35:53,420 --> 03:35:54,020
You're random.

5355
03:35:54,300 --> 03:35:55,340
You're fucking random.

5356
03:35:55,480 --> 03:35:57,800
You're a nobody or some shit.

5357
03:35:58,140 --> 03:35:59,760
And I was just like, lol, look me up.

5358
03:35:59,840 --> 03:36:03,260
And then he was like, who is this fucking anime PNG?

5359
03:36:03,900 --> 03:36:06,020
Like, you think that's so... And then I looked up his stream.

5360
03:36:06,080 --> 03:36:08,180
I was like, you think that's so tough?

5361
03:36:08,340 --> 03:36:11,680
And then I'm like, oh, you clearly didn't look up fully who I am.

5362
03:36:11,740 --> 03:36:13,840
Like, I'm literally friends with your boss.

5363
03:36:14,360 --> 03:36:20,040
Like, I'm just, like, thinking, like, I am literally friends with your fucking boss, you loser.

5364
03:36:20,860 --> 03:36:21,260
Like...

5365
03:36:25,840 --> 03:36:27,120
And he was mad.

5366
03:36:27,280 --> 03:36:28,220
Okay, it was today.

5367
03:36:28,420 --> 03:36:30,660
He was mad because I didn't Luna ult.

5368
03:36:31,100 --> 03:36:34,380
But the thing is, it's because our Loki copied me.

5369
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:36,280
Our Loki copied me.

5370
03:36:36,720 --> 03:36:39,260
And, um, he didn't use his Luna ult.

5371
03:36:39,340 --> 03:36:41,060
I was waiting for him.

5372
03:36:41,160 --> 03:36:45,040
I was waiting for him to ult so I wouldn't double support ult.

5373
03:36:45,140 --> 03:36:46,860
And then he copied me and died.

5374
03:36:47,420 --> 03:36:49,640
And then we died together because he didn't ult.

5375
03:36:49,760 --> 03:36:55,560
And then the end- and then my- and then the two fucking losers blamed me for the game because I didn't ult.

5376
03:36:55,960 --> 03:36:58,820
And I was just like, bro, fuck off.

5377
03:36:58,900 --> 03:37:01,240
You guys are, like, I'm gonna amount to nothing.

5378
03:37:03,040 --> 03:37:03,480
Like...

5379
03:37:05,140 --> 03:37:06,700
Um, it's barely a career.

5380
03:37:08,100 --> 03:37:10,380
But yes, no, I I'm petty.

5381
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:11,760
I'm so petty right now.

5382
03:37:11,800 --> 03:37:13,820
But I won't do- that's why I wasn't gonna do that.

5383
03:37:15,520 --> 03:37:15,960
Um...

5384
03:37:15,960 --> 03:37:18,400
Um, because they thought they were, like, big shots.

5385
03:37:18,800 --> 03:37:19,920
Because they're like, oh, I'm somebody.

5386
03:37:20,080 --> 03:37:22,360
And I'm like, you're barely an- you're barely anybody.

5387
03:37:24,440 --> 03:37:24,960
Like...

5388
03:37:24,960 --> 03:37:31,540
laughing laughing So that's why I'm not playing rank.

5389
03:37:31,720 --> 03:37:33,720
I am not playing rank.

5390
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:36,240
Um, while drunk.

5391
03:37:36,300 --> 03:37:39,500
Because I don't wanna- I don't wanna either terrorize.

5392
03:37:39,940 --> 03:37:43,760
I don't- laughing I don't know what I'll say when I'm not sober.

5393
03:37:44,020 --> 03:37:46,900
Because I might say my inside thoughts out loud.

5394
03:37:47,120 --> 03:37:49,720
Um, to those fuck- to people who fuck with me.

5395
03:37:49,780 --> 03:37:51,640
Because I- I hold it in a lot.

5396
03:37:52,300 --> 03:38:01,680
laughing I- I almost, like, I think if I was drunk and they did that I would have messaged their boss.

5397
03:38:01,800 --> 03:38:10,520
I would have messaged their- laughing And then the chat was like, oh, fuck fucking vtubers.

5398
03:38:10,760 --> 03:38:12,520
This makes me hate vtubers more.

5399
03:38:12,860 --> 03:38:14,520
And I was like, oh my god.

5400
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:19,320
I was just like you are watching a garbage piece of shit.

5401
03:38:19,640 --> 03:38:26,900
Like laughing laughing Like, oh yeah, support the guy that harasses other people.

5402
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:29,360
Yeah, you're better than me.

5403
03:38:29,860 --> 03:38:36,760
laughing laughing So that is why I am not doing rank.

5404
03:38:37,220 --> 03:38:38,720
My- these are my inside thoughts.

5405
03:38:38,840 --> 03:38:42,240
I would actually say that to them in voice chat if I play rank.

5406
03:38:42,240 --> 03:38:47,020
If anybody pisses me off my inside thoughts will not be my inside thoughts.

5407
03:38:47,580 --> 03:38:48,220
laughing

5408
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:55,720
Um, but yeah.

5409
03:38:55,940 --> 03:38:59,460
Uh, that- that but yeah, no.

5410
03:39:00,420 --> 03:39:06,200
I'm happy I did this stream right after my depression grind because, like, I definitely needed it.

5411
03:39:06,280 --> 03:39:07,380
I was very sad.

5412
03:39:07,860 --> 03:39:10,980
I was very sad before I took my nap.

5413
03:39:11,160 --> 03:39:15,380
Because you know how much time I've like, invested in doing that grind.

5414
03:39:15,640 --> 03:39:18,000
So I was like really sad about it.

5415
03:39:18,460 --> 03:39:21,360
Um, but like, I feel- definitely feel a lot better now.

5416
03:39:21,600 --> 03:39:24,020
Um, it was really fun hanging out with Min throughout it.

5417
03:39:24,200 --> 03:39:26,240
And like, it definitely cheered me up a lot more.

5418
03:39:26,640 --> 03:39:29,000
I don't know if the drink- the drinking definitely helped.

5419
03:39:29,180 --> 03:39:33,820
Um I now know why people are- Okay, this is a joke.

5420
03:39:33,960 --> 03:39:34,680
This is a joke.

5421
03:39:35,020 --> 03:39:39,660
I know now why people are alcoholics because like, I was sad but now I'm not sad.

5422
03:39:40,380 --> 03:39:42,420
But I won't make it a habit.

5423
03:39:42,620 --> 03:39:44,940
I won't make it.

5424
03:39:45,020 --> 03:39:47,480
I won't make it a habit.

5425
03:39:51,380 --> 03:39:57,200
Um, but I definitely feel a lot better.

5426
03:39:58,400 --> 03:39:59,900
Yeah, Minkitty?

5427
03:40:02,630 --> 03:40:04,370
I don't know what she's doing.

5428
03:40:06,730 --> 03:40:08,030
Crazy thing.

5429
03:40:08,030 --> 03:40:11,730
And this is a one-time thing.

5430
03:40:12,070 --> 03:40:15,850
This is a one-time thing, guys.

5431
03:40:16,010 --> 03:40:16,870
I swear to God.

5432
03:40:17,270 --> 03:40:20,990
Um, but it definitely cheered me up a lot more because I was actually so depressed.

5433
03:40:21,250 --> 03:40:24,430
I was like I was like, doom-posting to my friends.

5434
03:40:24,530 --> 03:40:25,050
I was like, okay.

5435
03:40:25,730 --> 03:40:29,650
Okay, I'll read you what- okay, I'll read you some of the shit I said I doom-posted.

5436
03:40:31,830 --> 03:40:32,990
Such a doomer.

5437
03:40:34,010 --> 03:40:34,890
Holy fuck.

5438
03:40:35,430 --> 03:40:36,630
Oh my God.

5439
03:40:41,110 --> 03:40:41,730
Okay.

5440
03:40:42,470 --> 03:40:44,270
Um, I don't know.

5441
03:40:44,750 --> 03:40:53,590
I feel like I gained nothing from the whole session the last month and a half, and instead a lot of problems and a lot of wasted time.

5442
03:40:54,330 --> 03:40:57,780
Ah, my friend.

5443
03:40:57,960 --> 03:41:02,660
I was so- I was dooming so hard before I, like, took a nap.

5444
03:41:03,080 --> 03:41:08,340
But to be fair, I played 40 plus hours of Rivals Rank at that time.

5445
03:41:12,300 --> 03:41:20,420
And it was more um, all these people who I thought were worse than me are higher ranked.

5446
03:41:24,550 --> 03:41:26,190
But I'm okay now.

5447
03:41:26,730 --> 03:41:27,330
I'm okay.

5448
03:41:27,530 --> 03:41:38,310
I was doom-posting the last, like, three days because like, every time it was a bad session, or like, the last week, because every time every time it was a bad session I was dooming so hard.

5449
03:41:39,050 --> 03:41:40,170
But I'm okay now.

5450
03:41:40,870 --> 03:41:42,210
Definitely the stream helped a lot.

5451
03:41:42,350 --> 03:41:43,210
I had a lot of fun with it.

5452
03:41:43,630 --> 03:41:45,430
I had a lot of fun with you guys watching too.

5453
03:41:45,490 --> 03:41:46,210
I'm normal now.

5454
03:41:46,530 --> 03:41:48,810
Don't worry, I'm normal now.

5455
03:41:49,530 --> 03:41:52,570
I didn't wish for just the amount of time I spent on it, but, like, it's alright.

5456
03:41:53,510 --> 03:42:00,930
Next season, I am taking a break- like, not break, but, like, I will be doing these- I'm not gonna commit to rank anymore.

5457
03:42:01,010 --> 03:42:02,710
I won't be trying for Top 500 anymore.

5458
03:42:02,790 --> 03:42:03,790
If it happens, it happens.

5459
03:42:04,250 --> 03:42:08,630
But it's not, like, my priority, and I'm gonna be focusing on other stuff now.

5460
03:42:09,690 --> 03:42:17,590
Focusing back on, like, you know, my career, my VTubing stuff instead of offline rank grind session, because that was a problem.

5461
03:42:18,010 --> 03:42:19,510
That was- that was a huge problem.

5462
03:42:21,210 --> 03:42:22,310
But I'm better now.

5463
03:42:22,390 --> 03:42:22,990
I'm better now.

5464
03:42:24,430 --> 03:42:25,670
I've accepted it.

5465
03:42:26,290 --> 03:42:31,330
But yes, everybody, I hope you guys had a great time with me and Mint.

5466
03:42:32,190 --> 03:42:35,550
I hope you guys had a fun time hanging out with us.

5467
03:42:36,450 --> 03:42:40,870
I am not sober, and I might continue drinking to finish the two and a half hours.

5468
03:42:41,670 --> 03:42:53,410
And most likely, I'll- the stream will be, like, in an hour or an half, because I wanna microwave my cold pasta, so I could, you know, get some more food in my system.

5469
03:42:54,290 --> 03:42:59,450
But yes, I hope you guys all had a great time.

5470
03:42:59,750 --> 03:43:02,070
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

5471
03:43:02,430 --> 03:43:03,210
Posture check.

5472
03:43:03,430 --> 03:43:05,390
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5473
03:43:05,530 --> 03:43:09,550
And if you, except for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

5474
03:43:09,710 --> 03:43:11,010
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5475
03:43:11,450 --> 03:43:12,410
Bye, guys.

5476
03:43:13,030 --> 03:43:13,550
Bye.

5477
03:43:23,930 --> 03:43:25,450
Oh, Mint was right.

5478
03:43:25,850 --> 03:43:26,950
You are forgiven!
