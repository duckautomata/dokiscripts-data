1
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Sorry, I forgot where the apex tab was.

2
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,580
I was like, where was it?

3
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,160
That's why the video paused for a couple of seconds.

4
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,880
I was like, where's my apex tab?

5
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,280
Good morning, everyone.

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,620
Good morning.

7
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,080
Good morning.

8
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,280
I woke up like 15 minutes ago.

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,420
Let's fucking go!

10
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,600
1230 stream!

11
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,600
I love my 1230 streams!

12
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,080
Yeah!

13
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,960
Good morning, everyone.

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
Guys, did you guys notice?

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,180
We hit 700k subscribers!

16
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,300
We fucking did it!

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,960
Holy shit.

18
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,640
We did our very first official milestone together.

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,700
Zy, thank you for the super chat.

20
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:46,960
Thank you.

21
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,700
Thank you!

22
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,680
Congrats on 700k.

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,700
Thank you everybody!

24
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,400
Our first official milestone!

25
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,260
Oh my god.

26
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,340
Oh my gosh.

27
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,860
This is our first one because like, you know, when we came back, we're like, I hope I get 500k before the end of the year.

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,740
And now we're at 700k.

29
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,580
It's absolutely fucking crazy.

30
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,500
I can't... I... okay, I...

31
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,480
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,160
I don't have a gift for you guys to celebrate.

33
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,840
It was just... there's so many things going on every day.

34
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,540
But don't worry.

35
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,460
There will be a belated gift.

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,500
It might be a...

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,960
a bit... it might be a...

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,680
month late.

39
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,520
But... but... I do have a belated gift for all of you guys to celebrate.

40
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,340
Bye!

41
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,340
Thank you for the super chat.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,640
Thank you.

43
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,180
Thank you.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,900
Let's go!

45
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,760
Congrats on 700k.

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,500
Thank you!

47
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,400
Bite size.

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,260
Thank you for the super chat.

49
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,020
Thank you.

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,660
Thank you.

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,320
A billion.

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,740
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

53
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,400
Thank you.

54
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,020
Thank you.

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,680
I'm... I'm still like waking up slowly because like I said, I just... I literally just woke up like...

56
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,040
Uh...

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,080
...15 minutes ago.

58
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,100
Ittragon.

59
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,060
Thank you for the super chat.

60
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,380
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,880
Thank you.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,560
Congrats on 700k.

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,340
Remember when you thought you were gonna have less subs?

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,040
Good luck, I'll take an 8 later today.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,420
Thank you for the super chat.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,720
Thank you.

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,240
Thank you.

68
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,060
Guys I am like...

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,340
I hope you guys are looking forward to the noose.

70
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:22,540
Guys, okay, I don't know if you remember this, but like, um, so during that I think that JP... Apex Legends tournament that we did.

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,020
You remember how like...

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,420
On that stream, I was like, oh, I almost leaked something for next season.

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,980
So what I almost leaked out for next season...

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,420
This was the season.

75
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,120
I almost leaked out the solo modes.

76
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,160
Because, you know...

77
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,780
I was told about the solos mode.

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,920
And the solos mode.

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,720
And the new legend.

80
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,700
And all that stuff.

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,540
And I was like, no, it wasn't the best season.

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,400
It was the JP, Apex Legends.

83
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,540
And I almost...

84
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,540
Because we were talking about solo stuff.

85
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,660
And I almost leaked out...

86
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,200
I was like, oh, you can do it next season.

87
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,480
Because there's solos mode.

88
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,580
And I almost said that.

89
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,240
That would have been such a huge oopsie.

90
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,860
Because solos mode is like a huge thing.

91
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,340
And I almost...

92
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,680
I almost said it out loud.

93
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,620
I was invited to the place...

94
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:23,700
Whoa!

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,620
I was actually...

96
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,800
You guys didn't know.

97
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,440
Okay, I don't know if I told you guys this story.

98
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,240
But...

99
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,020
I was actually...

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,060
I...

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,900
I was told what the next update was going to be.

102
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,540
So, there was like, you know, the new legend.

103
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,460
Which is basically like the better version of Wraith.

104
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,840
And I saw like gameplay of the new legend.

105
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,140
Because I also had like...

106
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,200
You know, I...

107
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
I have like...

108
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,840
A relationship with the...

109
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,800
With the Apex devs.

110
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
So like, you know, they would like tell me about what's going to be happening for next season.

111
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,260
And everything like that.

112
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,120
And then so...

113
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,740
So like...

114
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,300
They actually...

115
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,920
One of the devs actually wanted to invite me to LAN.

116
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,940
Because there was going to be an event at LAN or something.

117
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,520
I think they wanted me to do the solo...

118
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
You know, there's like the solo showcase.

119
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,220
And everything.

120
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,140
So like, one of the devs actually wanted to invite me to LAN.

121
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,420
With like, plane ticket.

122
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,540
And like, the plane ticket sort of...

123
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,860
Like, paying for my plane ticket.

124
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,540
And also like, the hotels and everything.

125
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,260
And then like, also like, getting to try out the...

126
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,040
The...

127
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,900
Getting to try out the new next season.

128
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,000
For at LAN.

129
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,880
But like, I had to refuse.

130
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,100
Because I also had like a lot of stuff.

131
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,380
I couldn't really travel anywhere at the moment.

132
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,760
Because I had a lot of stuff going on.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,880
And also, I was like...

134
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,740
To be fair, I was also really paranoid.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,480
Because I was like...

136
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,440
I don't want any photos taken.

137
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,440
Like...

138
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,220
Because I was like...

139
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,200
I was like...

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,060
Um...

141
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,780
I was like...

142
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,380
Wait...

143
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,200
Is there going to be like other content creators?

144
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,140
And they were like...

145
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,760
Oh yeah, yeah.

146
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,480
Like, we're inviting a select few of content creators as well.

147
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
I was like...

148
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,540
Oh, okay.

149
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,440
And I was like...

150
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
I'll think about it.

151
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,560
And I was like...

152
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,820
Okay.

153
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,560
At that...

154
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,020
At this moment, I was like...

155
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,640
I don't really...

156
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,240
I'm a bit paranoid.

157
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,680
I'm a bit...

158
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,960
I was like...

159
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,100
Oh, I am a bit paranoid.

160
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,640
I feel like...

161
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,700
But I also had like a lot of things going on in the background as well.

162
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,840
So...

163
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,500
So I had to say no.

164
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,260
And I was like...

165
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,480
I would love next time.

166
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,000
Maybe next time I feel like a bit more safe.

167
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,660
Like...

168
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,860
I think it's also because of everything going around about me.

169
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,320
And then stuff like that.

170
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,120
I was also concerned about my safety.

171
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,760
So I was just like...

172
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,540
Well, maybe next time when things like die down a bit more.

173
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,560
So...

174
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
So I was just like...

175
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,860
If things die down a bit more...

176
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,080
I'll...

177
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:17,980
I'll...

178
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,320
Maybe I'll try the next line.

179
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,800
I'll try the next one.

180
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,960
Brother, thank you for the Akasupa.

181
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,940
Thank you.

182
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,600
Thank you.

183
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,900
So...

184
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,400
So yeah, that's why I was like...

185
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,480
I was looking...

186
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,940
I was like...

187
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,380

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,440
Thank you.

208
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,020
Thank you.

209
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,060
Just got back home from a 3 day trip.

210
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Glad to be home.

211
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,680
And now you made it to 700k.

212
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,300
Thank you.

213
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,380
Thank you for the super chat.

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,700
Thank you.

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,280
Thank you.

216
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,420
Yeah.

217
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,940
It was really sweet.

218
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,640
Sweet of them.

219
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,420
I really love working with the Apex devs because they're super sweet and everything.

220
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,280
Anyway guys.

221
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,080
Anyway.

222
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,120
It's time.

223
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,080
It's time to check out the new Apex.

224
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,300
The new Apex gamemode.

225
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,880
I'm not going to do solos first because I'm a little scared.

226
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,780
I'm just a little scared.

227
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,120
Oh, shit.

228
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,740
There she is.

229
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,780
There's edgy race.

230
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,000
There we go.

231
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,860
This is going to be their reputation.

232
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,280
Oh, I can gift people?

233
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,940
Fuck no.

234
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,080
And she has a tail!

235
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,640
She has a fucking tail!

236
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,380
She has a fucking tail!

237
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,940
Look at that!

238
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,880
Oh my god, you know what she reminds me of?

239
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,900
She reminds me of that mutant in X-Men.

240
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,840
Fuck, what's his name?

241
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,580
What was his name?

242
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,560
What was that guy's name?

243
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,920
That's what she reminds me of?

244
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,440
Nightcrawler!

245
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:12,700
Yeah!

246
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,640
Nightcrawler!

247
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Like her toes even has like Nightcrawler looks.

248
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,220
Okay, her toes, sorry.

249
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,820
Look at her feeties.

250
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,660
Yeah, she looks just like Nightcrawler.

251
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,880
I feel like.

252
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,440
But yeah, she's apparently like the better version of Wraith.

253
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,600
And like more fun from what I'm told.

254
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,580
From like my friends that have like playtests.

255
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,880
And like when I tested her, she just looks like a...

256
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,940
What are her finishers though?

257
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,620
Dynamic Exit...

258
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,760
God, that's like...

259
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,620
Oh, it's like...

260
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,160
That ability reminds me of another character.

261
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,980
I can't fucking figure it out right now.

262
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Oh, that's actually pretty sick though.

263
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,980
Bro, she's fucking crazy.

264
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,590
Bro, even the finishers are fucked up.

265
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,070
Alright.

266
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,810
And then they...

267
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,830
6 days left.

268
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,330
Oh, Broken Moon.

269
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,030
Wait, what?

270
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,590
Why is there six days of fucking rank?

271
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,010
That does not make sense.

272
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,630
Hey guys, I'm bronze now.

273
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,250
Anyway...

274
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,830
Demotion per- Oh, because everybody starts at zero!

275
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,550
Okay, we're gonna try her out.

276
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,810
Wait, actually, we're gonna try her out in firing range.

277
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,110
I forgot about that.

278
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,790
We'll try her out in firing range.

279
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,270
Let me see my volume.

280
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,990
It's okay.

281
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,310
Settings, audio, yeah, alright.

282
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,110
Alright, alright, let's see.

283
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,510
So, how the fuck do I use her abilities?

284
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,290
Oh my god, is this the range?

285
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,410
Oh no, that's out of range, okay.

286
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,430
That's like, holy shit, the range!

287
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,650
Oh wait, that's out of range.

288
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,490
Nevermind.

289
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,110
That was not the range.

290
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,530
Guys, you know I can't read.

291
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,350
Hahaha.

292
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,070
Thank you for the super chat.

293
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,990
Thank you, thank you.

294
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,330
The legend is hot.

295
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,830
This legend is hot.

296
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,270
I'm reinstalling Apex.

297
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,310
Thank you for the super chat.

298
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,190
Thank you, thank you.

299
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,130
Um...

300
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,650
Alright, let's see.

301
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,290
Okay, there we go.

302
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,930
It's like, how do I get this to work?

303
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,050
Oh, this is gonna be hard to figure out the range.

304
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:31,970
Alright.

305
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,330
And then what do I do?

306
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,630
Then what do I do?

307
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,790
Where the fuck is my portal?

308
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,390
Wait...

309
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,050
Hahaha.

310
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,690
Wait.

311
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,450
Wait.

312
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,730
Where did my portal go?

313
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,430
Okay.

314
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,330
It's not like that.

315
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,390
Oh, wait, wait, I figured it out.

316
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,630
I figured it out, guys.

317
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,550
Okay.

318
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,410
Alright, guys, I'm so... I didn't read the actual thing.

319
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,330
I should have read it.

320
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,470
Okay, give me a sec.

321
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,470
Let me actually read.

322
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,150
Okay.

323
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,810
Get from the rip.

324
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,290
Can you interact with...

325
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,310
Okay, I know about this.

326
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,410
I've heard about this.

327
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,770
My friends who playtested this told me about this.

328
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,150
Q creates a passage through a surface.

329
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:14,470
Q creates a passage through a surface.

330
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,490
Oh!

331
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,470
So it's like...

332
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,610
Oh my god!

333
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,170
Oh my god!

334
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,710
I get it.

335
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,050
So like, if somebody locks the door, I can be like, no.

336
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,550
And then I go through the door.

337
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,610
Oh, I see!

338
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,650
I see!

339
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,430
So like, basically, it counters catalyst.

340
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,990
So they lock the door.

341
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,030
I can be like...

342
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,530
I can be like, no, bitch.

343
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,530
I'm in your walls.

344
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,090
Look, see?

345
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,570
There's like this door locked.

346
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,750
I'll be like, boom!

347
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,370
That's fucking right.

348
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,730
And I beat the shit out of that person right here in the corner.

349
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,950
Wait, can I drop from ceilings?

350
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,170
Oh my god, wait.

351
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,310
Wait, can you?

352
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,190
Okay.

353
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,010
Let's see.

354
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,410
We have 18 seconds.

355
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,630
What's the ult, though?

356
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,170
What the fuck is the ult?

357
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,610
Okay, wait, no.

358
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,850
Creates a regroup point that all allies can interact with to open the phase toilet.

359
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,410
Oh!

360
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,790
Yeah, so this is basically like a two-way ash portal.

361
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,370
I see.

362
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,450
Care package.

363
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,510
Reveal care package and see the highest...

364
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,690
Okay, we already know that.

365
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,110
Alright.

366
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,010
Okay, let's see.

367
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,570
Oh my god!

368
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,510
Oh, and you can go back up!

369
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,410
Wait, that's huge!

370
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:33,510
Look at that!

371
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,490
Oh my god!

372
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,450
We can actually, like, go from the ceiling!

373
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,310
That's actually pretty fucking cool.

374
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,830
Yeah.

375
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,090
Okay, let's see.

376
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:43,950
And then...

377
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,250
And then the portal.

378
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,310
Oh my god, we can drop down and be like, surprise, fuckers!

379
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,390
Okay.

380
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,530
Alright, we deploy.

381
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,590
Okay.

382
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,830
And then open portal.

383
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,270
And then what happens?

384
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,630
Oh, fuck.

385
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,310
Oh, wait.

386
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,290
I think I used it wrong.

387
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,230
I think I used the portal wrong.

388
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,570
Okay, give me a sec.

389
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,770
I was confused.

390
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,630
Where's the ultra gear?

391
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,010
I was confused!

392
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,310
Go far away and TP to...

393
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,210
Oh, it's a return point!

394
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,410
Oh!

395
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,570
Okay.

396
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,250
Okay.

397
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,890
And then...

398
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,570
And then what do I do?

399
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:41,710
Oh!

400
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,130
And then we, like, run, run, run!

401
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,750
And then... Oh, we can go so far!

402
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,390
Look at that!

403
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,890
That's like how... Oh, wait, no, that's the second.

404
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:49,810
Oh.

405
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,730
Yeah, and then we go...

406
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,110
I come back.

407
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,210
And that's everybody, right?

408
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,010
Oh my god!

409
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,430
Wait, that is so cool!

410
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,990
Wait, that is pretty cool.

411
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,930
It's a return portal.

412
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,590
I feel like that's... Can I do it again?

413
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,890
Is that gonna be, like, there forever?

414
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,650
Can I do that again?

415
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,170
Why is it... Oh, no, I can't.

416
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,650
I can't do it like that again.

417
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,390
Yeah, this guy is like... It's like Nightcrawler.

418
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,690
And Shadowcat.

419
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,830
Thank you, Superchat Jesse.

420
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,930
Thank you, thank you.

421
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,030
That's actually really sick.

422
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,070
I think I like this better.

423
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,890
No, I think I like this the most.

424
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,330
Because, like, the fact that, like...

425
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,850
Doors are no longer the enemy!

426
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,470
Doors are no longer the enemy!

427
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,790
I think that's the...

428
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,570
That's the most fun part.

429
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,670
No longer will doors hinder me.

430
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,170
She's in here once.

431
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,090
No longer.

432
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,790
Welcome back to the tomato farm!

433
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,470
Welcome, welcome!

434
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,710
Doors and floors and ceilings, too.

435
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,890
You can never hide from Doki.

436
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,730
You can never hide from me!

437
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,110
Peek-a-boo!

438
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,770
What are those?

439
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,270
That's right, Catalyst.

440
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,970
You thought reinforcing your waz can stop me?

441
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,010
Nothing can stop me!

442
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,890
I'll just come in from the ceiling!

443
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,590
Alright.

444
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,170
Yeah, you can't hide from me no longer.

445
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,350
I mean, that's pretty cool.

446
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:24,450
I mean, that's pretty cool.

447
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,390
I really like the abilities.

448
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,710
They seem really fun.

449
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,970
They seem like a fun character to play in general.

450
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,690
Now, the question is, will I be able to play her?

451
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,230
That's the question!

452
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,490
Peek-a-boo!

453
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,070
Alright.

454
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,050
Let's see if I can play her.

455
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,470
Like, oh my god, the way... oh my god, she's a fucking freak.

456
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,510
You know she's a freak.

457
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,150
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

458
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,170
Alan, thank you for the super chat!

459
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,050
Thank you, thank you!

460
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,150
Atobe is suddenly coming from your ceiling!

461
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,010
True horror!

462
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,050
Thank you for the super chat!

463
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,190
Thank you, thank you!

464
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,710
Alright, here we go.

465
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,350
Here we go.

466
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,090
That's a cute name!

467
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,430
She probably...

468
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:13,930
Nooooo!

469
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,710
Give me...

470
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,410
I'm streamer.

471
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,630
Ha ha ha!

472
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,070
No!

473
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,790
Let me play!

474
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,970
I stream!

475
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,110
Oh yeah!

476
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,630
I'll be the better...

477
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,450
I'll be the lesser version of you, I guess.

478
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,990
Ha ha ha ha!

479
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,590
I'm you.

480
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,930
But less.

481
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,310
Ha ha ha!

482
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,650
Yeah, look at my...

483
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,590
Look at my badge!

484
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,130
You could have had me on...

485
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,850
On the new legend!

486
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,950
Oh wait, he won.

487
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,270
Nevermind, maybe he is pretty good.

488
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,210
Ha ha ha!

489
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,770
I'm the last game.

490
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,250
Alright.

491
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,410
I'm you, but worse!

492
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,170
Ha ha ha!

493
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,610
Ha ha ha!

494
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,620
No character on banner?

495
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,860
Welcome to...

496
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,260
I almost said welcome to Overwatch.

497
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,060
Because that seven hours of Overwatch still lives rent free in my head.

498
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,280
Also, how's the volume?

499
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,100
I forgot what the default sound was for Apex.

500
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,100
In general.

501
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,320
So like, I might have like...

502
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,680
I don't know if it's too loud or not.

503
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,300
Weeeeee!

504
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,900
Okay, nice.

505
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,620
I got Havoc.

506
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,500
That's seven hours.

507
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,280
Oh yeah, I forgot.

508
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,220
The wingman is back on the floor.

509
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,360
Alright.

510
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,120
It's back guys.

511
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,340
I know there's no like digi threat though on the wingy.

512
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
Did anyone else land here?

513
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,680
Hello?

514
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,920
Hello?

515
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,460
Is anyone else here?

516
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,260
I don't feel like...

517
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,960
I don't think anyone else landed here.

518
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,380
Oh, Legend of Stock.

519
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,860
Thank God.

520
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,920
They've had it too good for too long.

521
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,820
Did you was deleted?

522
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah.

523
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,780
Did you guys hear the rumors of like...

524
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,780
Wait.

525
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,860
Did I hear something?

526
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,640
No, that's not it.

527
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,560
Thank you for the super chat.

528
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

529
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,040
Okay, look, if you had the power that I had, you would abuse the shit out of it.

530
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,780
Don't lie to yourself, okay?

531
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,600
If you can, like, use it to your advantage, you win.

532
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,320
Just like how getting early access to things Marvel rivals.

533
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,640
So true.

534
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,440
Hey, can I have early access?

535
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,880
I'm a streamer.

536
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,060
You win!

537
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,960
If you had that opportunity, you would 100% do the same thing.

538
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,800
Thank you for the magenta soup, bud.

539
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,360
Thank you, thank you.

540
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,480
Why did he land us here?

541
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,760
There's literally nobody here.

542
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,880
All right.

543
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,280
Oh yeah, they took away skull piercer in a mag.

544
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,940
Okay, do you hear the rumors, guys?

545
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,940
That like, um...

546
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,080
That like, TSM might disband?

547
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,520
That's actually fucking crazy.

548
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,540
There's like rumors going around that TSM might...

549
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,920
Disband.

550
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,760
Uh, because of the perfo- Because of their performance in ALGS.

551
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,240
Yeah, because like, uh...

552
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
Verhos and uh...

553
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,060
Verhos and Reps tweeted out like very suspicious tweets today.

554
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,060
Uh, yeah.

555
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,200
Did you start those rumors?

556
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,880
Did you guys not see?

557
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,160
They were tweeting out some very fucking suspicious...

558
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Uh...

559
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,660
Suspicious tweets.

560
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,760
They- not like the org TSM, but like the Apex.

561
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,020
Uh...

562
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,060
The Apex team are thinking about disbanding.

563
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,000
Which is fucking crazy because they're known as one of the longest teams to get it.

564
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,060
Like, I mean not- not like Verhos, but like- like Jordan.

565
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,220
Sorry, Reps.

566
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,260
I don't know why I said it.

567
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,360
I don't know why I said his first name.

568
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:13,860
Uh...

569
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,200
Uh...

570
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,560
Uh...

571
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,140
Uh...

572
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,260
He's weird like 27 years old.

573
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,980
Alright, let's see.

574
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,500
Ultimate reduce, ultimate cooldowns, passive warms...

575
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,840
WOOOOOOAHHHHHHHHH You don't know him like THAT!!!

576
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,420
Yeah, it's actually wall the walls!

577
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,780
I'm in your walls!

578
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,540
Alright...

579
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,180
Alright, give me... holy shit, what a fucking head glitch.

580
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,520
That's fucking right.

581
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,560
I might not have played this for a while.

582
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,820
Wait, where are they?

583
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,440
Wait, what the fuck?

584
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,160
Wait, what?

585
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh!

586
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,300
Okay, nice.

587
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,700
I helped.

588
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,640
There you go.

589
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,880
I fucking helped.

590
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,520
Okay, let's see.

591
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,680
Nice, we need that.

592
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Well... don't worry!

593
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,180
Don't worry, guys!

594
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,000
I got you!

595
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,320
Okay, never mind.

596
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,320
He climbed.

597
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:15,980
Oh!

598
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,160
Oh my god, there he is!

599
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,260
Okay, where are you?

600
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,900
I'll hit those shots!

601
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,100
I hit it.

602
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,820
I did it, guys.

603
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,620
Did you see it?

604
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,660
Bacon, thank you for the magenta soup!

605
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,680
Thank you, thank you!

606
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,340
I have morals, okay, Doki?

607
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,660
I do things a good old way.

608
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,220
Old fashioned way.

609
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,540
Through bribery!

610
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,580
Yeah, but bacon, you know what's better than that?

611
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,700
When you can get things for free.

612
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,920
Dang.

613
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,020
Yeah, did you guys see that?

614
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,220
I hit all those shots.

615
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,860
I know, it just happened so fast.

616
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,080
It's a bit hard to see, I know.

617
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,200
Wait, am I getting shot?

618
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,840
Or did he shoot me?

619
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,900
I couldn't tell.

620
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,420
Wait, what's this?

621
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,000
What the fuck is that?

622
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,460
Oh, it's like a little barrier!

623
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,860
Wait, that's so cool!

624
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,060
Okay, all these changes, no, not gonna make up for the fact that Broken Moon fucking sucks, though.

625
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,400
And we're gonna have like several days of this, too.

626
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,300
Oh, they're near me.

627
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,280
Warn my teammates?

628
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,740
Nah.

629
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,160
Nah.

630
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,220
Okay.

631
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,900
Where are they?

632
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,900
They're near me.

633
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,400
Oh, they're over there?

634
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,420
Alright, don't worry, I have my portal.

635
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,820
Do it again, don't worry, I got you.

636
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,680
Wait, where are they?

637
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,960
Oh, they're above me!

638
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,100
They were that near me?

639
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,900
Did they see me?

640
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,640
I don't think they saw me, guys.

641
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm going on the roof.

642
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm in your roof now.

643
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,500
There we go.

644
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,520
WHOA!

645
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,620
There we go, did you see that?

646
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,400
Oh shit, did you?

647
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,360
Whoa!

648
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,260
Did you guys see that?

649
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,080
Look at those shots I hit!

650
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Whoa!

651
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,620
I killed him!

652
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,880
That was me.

653
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,160
Nice, look at you go.

654
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,220
Nice.

655
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,160
I knew I could deal with that.

656
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,760
Okay, tactical windup, reduce tactical windup.

657
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,240
Tactical cooldown.

658
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,620
I haven't played Raven so long.

659
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,940
I don't even know what her cooldowns were.

660
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,140
Okay.

661
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,540
Grab this.

662
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,080
That's your streamer.

663
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,420
That's me!

664
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,800
Okay.

665
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,900
Oh, wait, is she Chinese?

666
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,020
She just said, wait, wait!

667
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,360
Oh my god.

668
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,340
Oh my god, wait, is she actually Chinese?

669
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,600
That's so cool.

670
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,560
I just realized we've never had a Chinese legend yet.

671
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,180
Our streamer.

672
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,600
I was blinking against you.

673
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,880
Those shots you thought I missed is because you were blinking so you missed the frames.

675
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,940
Yeah, she said, wait, wait.

676
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,900
See?

677
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,360
Look, this is how I was supposed to...

678
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,600
I am hitting those.

679
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,920
I almost pressed Q for a conduit.

680
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,220
I've been playing conduit for so long.

681
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,880
I'm going to go with that backpack from you.

682
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,280
Okay, maybe if I need him.

683
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,980
He's going to have to push up.

684
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:27,920
Yep.

685
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,740
Wait, where is he?

686
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,920
Is this...

687
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,400
Is that mine?

688
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,080
That's mine.

689
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,400
Okay.

690
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,140
Wait, why are you running?

691
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,020
Oh my god, he's tap strafing too!

692
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,920
Okay, maybe I should...

693
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,340
Wait, what?

694
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,220
Oh, shit.

695
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

696
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,040
Don't worry, don't worry, bro.

697
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,840
Don't worry.

698
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,520
Is he rising him?

699
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,200
No?

700
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,660
Okay, let's thrash them then.

701
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Just in case.

702
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,210
Where?

703
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,750
Where?

704
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,430
Where?

705
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,070
I'm so confused.

706
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,710
Holy shit.

707
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,090
Okay, guys.

708
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,310
Does it look like I haven't played Apex often for a very long time?

709
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,950
I did play Apex two days ago just to be like, oh shit, new season.

710
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,810
But it doesn't look like I'm that rusty, right?

711
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,050
Right?

712
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,770
No, right?

713
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,130
I'm naturally talented, so I should look okay, right?

714
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,110
It's because...

715
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,110
Okay, I'll say it's because...

716
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,850
Let me aim it.

717
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,110
Oh, holy shit.

718
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,610
He's so far.

719
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,150
Look, I have a perfectly good excuse for this.

720
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,550
Okay, guys?

721
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,090
Because I'm playing Wingman.

722
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,990
Okay?

723
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,190
I'm playing Wingman, so that's my excuse.

724
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,550
And he's also playing Wingman.

725
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,650
Look, see?

726
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,910
He's not hitting his shots.

727
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,050
It's just a Wingman debuff.

728
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:01,710
Whoops.

729
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,110
Oh, shit.

730
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,610
Okay, I was not expecting him to just be there.

731
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,030
Look, I hit one.

732
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,050
Look, one is one.

733
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,170
Wait, what?

734
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,050
Oh, wait.

735
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,810
That's the Mirage.

736
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,710
Where the fuck are they?

737
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,510
This team is making me so, like, confused.

738
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,270
Where?

739
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,930
Where the fuck did he go?

740
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,490
Okay, let me loot this guy first.

741
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,950
Boosted Loader.

742
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,430
Do I need Wingman ammo?

743
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,570
I can't believe I actually need Wingman ammo.

744
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,670
Alright.

745
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,210
Look, it says I got two kills.

746
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,270
So, like, I'm not totally worthless.

747
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,650
Alright, here we go.

748
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,790
Where the fuck...

749
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,570
Where the fuck is the other team?

750
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,730
Alright, if I stand still, I won't get hit.

751
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,010
I'm gonna blow my nose.

752
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,390
Just give me a sec.

753
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,890
Surely, I won't get shot at.

754
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:22,730
All I'm saying is that the shots you don't see me hit are...

755
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,010
are the shots that...

756
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,290
Wait, if I use this, does it, like, expire for everybody?

757
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,470
Oh, they're near me.

758
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,910
Does it expire?

759
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,490
Or does it still stay up?

760
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,750
I actually don't know how this works.

761
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,170
No, everyone gets one use.

762
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:44,510
Oh!

763
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,910
Oh, I see.

764
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,590
Okay.

765
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,170
But, yeah, you think I don't hit those shots, but because...

766
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,050
It's your blinking.

767
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,850
You're blinking to the frames of me hitting shots.

768
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,770
You can hear it, but then if you don't see the visual...

769
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,850
the visual effect of the shot hitting, it's because you blinked.

770
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,550
That's...

771
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,670
It's so fast.

772
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,090
Yeah, you just couldn't register it.

773
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,610
Like, all of you guys, too.

774
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,990
I can't believe... it's like...

775
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,710
I can't believe all of you had that experience, too.

776
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,590
That's actually... What are the chances?

777
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,130
What were the odds of that happening?

778
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,210
It's like one to a million, and you were there.

779
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,950
It's like a natural phenomenon.

780
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,530
Pert lane.

781
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,690
Oh, shit.

782
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,350
Is this Horizon Q a new visual?

783
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,090
Oh my god.

784
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,210
Okay, this team is actually goaded.

785
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,810
What the fuck?

786
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,970
I did it.

787
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:43,890
Alright,

788
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,630
ooh.

789
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,690
There's the bow.

790
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,530
I feel like I hit more shots with a bow than...

791
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,830
than the fucking wall.

792
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,030
I'm going mad at this point.

793
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,870
Wait, behind us?

794
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,890
Wait, who do I go to?

795
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,470
I'm gonna go to the cat.

796
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,630
I did it, guys!

797
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,970
What is he trying to... chase?

798
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,610
Hello?

799
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,200
What does he wanna do?

800
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,360
They're close to me.

801
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,580
But I won't let them know that.

802
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,700
Gotta keep them... keep them on their toes.

803
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
I hear them.

804
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:32,980
Yeah.

805
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,260
Please.

806
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,420
I told you!

807
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,740
I hit more shots with the bow!

808
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,180
I fucking knew it!

809
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,040
Oh, shit.

810
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,680
I can't hear you.

811
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,560
I knew I hit more with the bow.

812
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,880
I should full heal, actually.

813
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,060
Look, it's been so long.

814
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,480
Wait, that is him.

815
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,420
I thought he was just like... a mirage clone.

816
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,360
Oh, shit.

817
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,600
Maybe I should...

818
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,560
You guys!

819
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,360
You guys!

820
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,660
I forgot!

821
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:19,800
I forgot!

822
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,240
When you climb, it cancels!

823
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:25,940
Hey!

824
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:26,920
Sorry.

825
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,860
Guys, they hit me!

826
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,860
Guys!

827
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:29,900
Oh my god!

828
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,140
Guys!

829
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,360
The... the bullets like fucking...

830
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,660
curved, guys!

831
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,220
It was absolutely insane, team!

832
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,980
That bullet curve!

833
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,260
That...

834
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,960
Guys, did you see it?

835
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,540
They hit those shots!

836
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,380
It was insane!

837
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,260
The fucking bullet curve there!

838
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,560
Holy shit!

839
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,320
The bullet curve!

840
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,300
It was absolutely crazy!

841
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,260
Max!

842
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,220
I know, right?

843
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,860
Oh my god, they already got a kill!

844
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,400
I was there.

845
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,720
I'm gonna farm some damage so I won't look like total ass.

846
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,080
There we go.

847
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,300
Going one more team!

848
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,080
Yeah!

849
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,600
We did it!

850
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,260
First game!

851
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,260
I was part of this team!

852
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,640
Yay!

853
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,880
I was part of the process!

854
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,960
Let's just leave.

855
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,840
Let's just...

856
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,040
Oh, wait.

857
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:45,100
As a party leader, you can requeue the party if you exit at any time.

858
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,700
Wait.

859
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,200
What?

860
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,680
We'll also have to return to...

861
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:48,820
Oh!

862
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,620
Wait.

863
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,020
That's...

864
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,320
What?

865
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,380
No.

866
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:51,980
Fuck you.

867
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh.

868
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
Oh, I wasn't the worst!

869
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,240
Guys!

870
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,200
I wasn't the worst one!

871
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,420
Wait!

872
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,100
I thought I did so little damage!

873
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,480
But I actually did just enough!

874
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,680
I didn't...

875
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,300
It wasn't me!

876
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,300
Guys, I realized I was actually good.

877
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,820
Oh my god.

878
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,360
I was just enough.

879
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,040
I was the middle of the pack, chat.

880
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,620
I was the middle of the pack.

881
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,700
I blinked it.

882
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,200
Oh!

883
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,680
Now you blink.

884
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,600
Now...

885
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,520
I was in the sandbag all this time!

886
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,400
I was part of the process!

887
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,460
I fucking knew it.

888
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,760
I knew I was in the sandbag.

889
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,700
Oh, thank god.

890
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,240
I can play this character now.

891
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,120
Middle...

892
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,760
I was average.

893
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,920
I was just enough.

894
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,960
Look, I did play Wraith, which was her, but worse.

895
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,300
She was mid.

896
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,840
Let's go.

897
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,980
Let's fucking go.

898
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,700
This is it.

899
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,320
This is me.

900
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,510
Yeah.

901
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,030
It's the new chat.

902
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,710
Um, already forgot.

903
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,130
That's me!

904
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,910
That's me.

905
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,070
I forgot her name already.

906
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,150
What's her name?

907
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:19,550
Ulter?

908
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,850
Is that her name?

909
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,490
No matter how much they change this map, this map will always be ass.

910
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,690
I changed my mind.

911
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,210
Sorry.

912
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,530
It was blinking too much.

913
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:31,890
Khaazouk!

914
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,810
Thank you for the super chat, bro.

915
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,610
Thank you, thank you.

916
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,030
Is it altered?

917
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,850
Yeah, okay.

918
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:40,310
Because it doesn't... changing the map doesn't change the size of this map.

919
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,190
Which is what was a huge problem.

920
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,850
Because the map was too fucking big.

921
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,430
I mean like...

922
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,450
Yeah, I just think the map is just too big.

923
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,130
I forgot Broken Moon existed.

924
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,130
We all want to forget Broken Moon existed.

925
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:03,770
This is like a nice cool designed place but still pretty fucking terrible map.

926
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,750
I don't think anybody likes Broken Moon in general.

927
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,810
I don't think anyone actually likes this goddamn map.

928
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,090
Hello.

929
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,370
Can I steal your stuff?

930
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,250
I want to do triple... actually I really want to play triple take.

931
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,630
For like one fight.

932
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,570
Because triple take is still an ass gun.

933
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,110
Alright.

934
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:27,870
Alright, let's see.

935
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,750
Oh wait.

936
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,730
Don't worry!

937
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,610
I got you!

938
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,350
Boom!

939
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,130
Where this is going to take me?

940
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,630
Oh, right here.

941
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,110
Alright.

942
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,150
Wait, where is the person that she's fighting?

943
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,470
I hear him.

944
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,250
Yeah, that's fucking right.

945
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:45,790
I see you.

946
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,390
Okay, I was going to say.

947
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,850
You better not die to that.

948
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,130
Because I literally like...

949
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:51,790
Whoa.

950
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,090
Hey thanks for the loot.

951
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,280
Nice.

952
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,060
Wait, what?

953
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,340
Wait, what?

954
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh shit, this is bad.

955
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,160
Waaaaait, this is... I was like...

956
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,920
Wait...

957
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,260
Two?

958
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,980
That doesn't add up.

959
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,100
This number.

960
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,400
This number does not add up.

961
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,220
How is there two when I killed two already?

962
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,700
I might be bad at math, but I know when numbers don't line up.

963
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,580
2 plus 2 equals 3?

964
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,480
That ain't right!

965
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,820
What the fuck happened?

966
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,320
Oh, it's the same team again.

967
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,260
We're running it back.

968
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,440
The non-existent win streak.

969
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,040
It's them again.

970
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,020
Alright, these guys better fucking pick up the slack, cause I got two.

971
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,760
I got my twos!

972
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,770
One of them- wait, no, actually, I got my ones.

973
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,030
Who was it?

974
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,710
Who did not get their ones?

975
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,470
She's meeting people up again.

976
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,390
Wait, this guy got a rookie badge.

977
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,350
What a fucking legend.

978
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,730
I wish I could get a rookie badge.

979
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,990
Awesome, thank you so much.

980
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,590
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

981
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,830
Sorry, I was blinking more again.

982
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:32,950
Okay.

983
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,270
Alright, you guys, run it back.

984
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,650
Run it back.

985
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,570
It's revenge time.

986
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,290
You're Diamond, you better impress me.

987
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,250
Who am I kidding?

988
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:46,930
He's Diamond.

989
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,390
He's already disappointed me.

990
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,870
Who am I kidding?

991
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,770
Alright.

992
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,290
Let's see.

993
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,050
Grab the G7 scout.

994
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,650
We're gonna get rid of the G7 scout cause I'm fucking terrible at it.

995
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,830
Oh, I hear people fighting in there.

996
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,510
In there?

997
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,790
In here, there's so many.

998
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,230
Oh, there's people.

999
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,210
I hear people next to me.

1000
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,170
Or am I fucking going skitza?

1001
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,550
No, there are people next to me.

1002
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,950
I see them.

1003
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,090
They went through the portal.

1004
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,190
He doesn't see me though.

1005
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,750
Alright, watch this.

1006
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,370
Peek-a-boo!

1007
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:45,710
Okay.

1008
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,680
That was a little ambitious there.

1009
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,820
He peek-a-booed back.

1010
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,280
I didn't expect the peek-a-boo.

1011
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,840
I didn't expect him to look back at me.

1012
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,940
He knew.

1013
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,220
He stared back into the void and shot me.

1014
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,300
That's crazy.

1015
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,340
I can't believe he shot back.

1016
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,080
That's the craziest thing you can do.

1017
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,300
Oh.

1018
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,560
Wait, there's like two different teams here.

1019
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,980
Oh shit, no!

1020
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,520
Come on!

1021
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,900
I did so much damage!

1022
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,820
Hey guys.

1023
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,700
Nice.

1024
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,960
Steven, thank you for the super chat!

1025
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,960
Thank you, thank you!

1026
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,200
Good luck on the new season!

1027
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,820
Thank you!

1028
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,320
Okay.

1029
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,160
Oh no.

1030
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,220
I need to grab the armor.

1031
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,360
How do I like grab stuff from other people's inventories?

1032
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,760
Because that should be like my special, right?

1033
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,680
I should be able to grab stuff from other people's inventory.

1034
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,700
Alright.

1035
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,500
Extend highlight and see how far I can go.

1036
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,760
Help bars after it reduces cooldown.

1037
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,720
I feel like...

1038
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,600
Extends highlight to help bars after exiting?

1039
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,660
Really, that's good.

1040
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,600
Just look from afar?

1041
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,780
Oh!

1042
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,160
Okay, I got this.

1043
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,560
I understand.

1044
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,060
I actually do understand.

1045
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,100
I'm not like saying it.

1046
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,580
It's not like the old I understand where I don't understand.

1047
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,580
And I'm just saying it.

1048
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,080
Just because I don't want people to think I don't understand.

1049
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,260
Oh, there it is!

1050
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,160
Alright.

1051
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,760
But I actually understand for real this time.

1052
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,400
Like...

1053
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,420
I actually understand, guys.

1054
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,620
And I'm not saying it.

1055
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,760
Alright.

1056
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,280
Don't worry, I got this.

1057
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm gonna help my team.

1058
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,040
Wait, can I steal this?

1059
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,560
Let's see.

1060
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,600
Okay.

1061
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,500
I can steal from each box.

1062
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,440
Oh my god!

1063
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,900
I can steal from each box!

1064
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,820
Wait, that's so cool!

1065
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,680
I love that.

1066
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,620
I...

1067
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,500
I fucked up.

1068
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,240
I got shot by three people.

1069
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,420
I don't know.

1070
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,260
I don't know, guys.

1071
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,820
I don't know.

1072
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,260
I don't know.

1073
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,160
Maybe they're gonna swing.

1074
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,760
I don't know.

1075
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,500
Whoa!

1076
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,140
Okay.

1077
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,460
Okay.

1078
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,080
Oh my god!

1079
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,240
Okay!

1080
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,800
Are they still in that corner?

1081
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,800
Oh my god!

1082
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
Oh my god!

1083
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,600
Oh my god!

1084
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,480
No!

1085
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,200
No!

1086
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,340
Please!

1087
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,160
Why is everybody here?!

1088
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,480
Please just shoot each other.

1089
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,100
Okay.

1090
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,740
I understand.

1091
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,360
Don't worry.

1092
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,460
They're shooting each other, guys.

1093
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,580
He's right here.

1094
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,560
He's right here.

1095
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,360
He's gonna...

1096
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,060
He's right here.

1097
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,120
Loot, please!

1098
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,940
Loot the box!

1099
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,060
Oh, god!

1100
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,880
My greed!

1101
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,040
My greed!

1102
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,000
God, the better of me!

1103
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,680
Oh, my god!

1104
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,020
He used the portal.

1105
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,500
Guys, I should have used the portal and ran through the walls somehow.

1106
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,860
It's okay, we have a conduit.

1107
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,840
That means like somebody's gonna... she can like craft us.

1108
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,780
Look, I'm still learning the hero.

1109
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,100
I'm still learning.

1110
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,700
This is like my second time playing her, guys.

1111
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,560
Come on.

1112
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,640
Does she not have shields?

1113
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,180
Where the fuck is her shield?

1114
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,480
Guys, pick me up.

1115
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm important.

1116
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,300
Guys, it doesn't look... oh, she's coming back.

1117
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:34,660
Okay.

1118
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,620
She knows I'm important, guys.

1119
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,400
See?

1120
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,540
I knew I was important, guys.

1121
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,520
I knew I was the main character.

1122
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,460
Even she knew I was important.

1123
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,420
She came back.

1124
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,620
How important was I?

1125
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,400
I got my banner picked up.

1126
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,180
That's important enough.

1127
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,980
No stream... yeah, my streamer privilege coming in clutch again.

1128
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,100
Oh my gosh.

1129
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,480
I'm looking... I know like... okay, I was gonna say.

1130
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,520
I know like... I said that...

1131
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,540
I said that we were... you know... that this week was gonna be a rest week.

1132
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,880
This week is not going to be the rest week, by the way.

1133
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,520
You guys didn't know.

1134
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,600
It's not!

1135
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:18,680
It's not!

1136
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,760
Too many things came up last minute.

1137
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:31,120
But I'm also like super looking forward to... I'm looking forward to Hades 2.

1138
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,740
I was like... that like... oh my gosh.

1139
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,200
The sudden drop... the Hades 2 drop out of nowhere.

1140
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,600
That's actually crazy.

1141
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,440
The fact that we have Hades 2 before anything about Silksong.

1142
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,220
Like...

1143
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,180
Like...

1144
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,080
Like...

1145
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,760
Like...

1146
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:47,880
Like...

1147
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,480
Silksong... I love Silksong.

1148
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,160
Waiters out there.

1149
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,180
Hades 2, let's go.

1150
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,240
The Silksong copium.

1151
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,740
Guys, no.

1152
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,680
It's gonna come out soon.

1153
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,440
You guys don't know that.

1154
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:04,920
It's just...

1155
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,420
It's just cause like Hades 2... Hades 2 is... is an early access.

1156
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,120
But when Silksong comes out, it's gonna be full access.

1157
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,120
You guys don't understand.

1158
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,220
You guys do be like that.

1159
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,420
Damn...

1160
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,960
Anyway... anyway...

1161
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,780
I was like looking up like... I was like... okay... cause it's early access.

1162
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,860
And so I was like... okay... so like... how much content is actually in there?

1163
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,280
And apparently... the majority of like... the story content is like actually almost done.

1164
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,800
It's mostly just like the the little things in the game.

1165
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,600
So... okay.

1166
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,100
Okay, reduce tactical avoidance.

1167
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,220
Next is no longer times out.

1168
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,460
Wait, that's so cool.

1169
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,520
Wait, where's my teammates?

1170
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,440
Oh, they are far.

1171
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,020
I'm gonna go to my teammates again.

1172
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,400
Yeah, it's just missing the end, right?

1173
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,760
Yeah, most of the gameplay seems to be there.

1174
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,880
So like, it's just the little things.

1175
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,440
It's just apparently the ending is not...

1176
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,040
So like, it's technically like hours of gameplay, which is crazy to think about.

1177
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,540
That that is early access and it's already like hours of gameplay.

1178
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,700
Oh, goodbye, sir.

1179
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,980
Okay, those shots were fucking nasty.

1180
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,720
You have to admit that.

1181
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,040
Wait, what the fuck?

1182
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,480
Oh my god.

1183
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,360
They actually thirsted him.

1184
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,560
Holy shit.

1185
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,160
That poor guy.

1186
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,800
That poor guy actually got thirsted.

1187
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:56,840
Okay, you have to admit, that was a sick-ass shot I did on whoever this guy was.

1188
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,280
Tom Lee.

1189
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,120
I didn't even need to use my abilities.

1190
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,980
Bro, panic ulted.

1191
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,640
I mean, I would too after I fucking demolished his teammate.

1192
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,140
Like, I'd be fucking concerned.

1193
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,320
Okay.

1194
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,580
I don't like the sound of that.

1195
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,560
I heard nades.

1196
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,220
But from where?

1197
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,560
Am I hearing things again?

1198
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,620
I might be hearing things again.

1199
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,800
I'm gonna steal something from our teammates.

1200
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,800
I wasn't hearing things.

1201
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,660
I fucking knew it.

1202
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,260
Watch this.

1203
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,540
Peekaboo.

1204
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,460
Oh.

1205
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,240
Okay.

1206
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,100
I saw the help bar.

1207
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,560
I was like, teammate?

1208
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,580
Wooo!

1209
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,820
Not gonna lie.

1210
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,800
I actually thought it was my teammate, but I forgot that was my ability.

1211
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,120
I was like, wait a minute, help bar.

1212
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,040
That doesn't make sense.

1213
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,780
That actually doesn't make sense.

1214
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,200
But it was...

1215
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,620
I made it like that.

1216
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,300
Teammate?

1217
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,420
I'm not sure.

1218
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:17,880
I'm not sure.

1219
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:17,900
I'm not sure.

1220
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,960
Alright.

1221
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,340
Okay, I knew that was not teammate this time.

1222
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,040
This time I knew.

1223
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,580
Can I like steal something?

1224
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,600
Ehh.

1225
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,710
I'm gonna put this here.

1226
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:39,470
Alright.

1227
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,270
Here we go, we're fine.

1228
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,010
I think there's like another team here.

1229
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,550
I feel that there's like another team here.

1230
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:48,390
Alright.

1231
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:49,730
We can see something.

1232
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:51,530
Where?

1233
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,570
Where did you get shot?

1234
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,170
This guy?

1235
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,230
Oh my god, okay.

1236
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:56,750
Alright, push.

1237
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:57,730
Resim, Resim.

1238
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,910
I'll protect you guys.

1239
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,090
Resim!

1240
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,330
I got you.

1241
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:03,850
I'm covering.

1242
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,430
Where is he shooting at?

1243
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,710
Oh, it's the portal!

1244
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,210
I was like, what?

1245
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,350
Okay, that poor man.

1246
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,850
Also, I realized I did not loot any shield cells.

1247
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,010
Let me steal that shield cell real fast.

1248
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:21,150
No!

1249
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,930
I stole fucking health!

1250
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,130
Okay, okay.

1251
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:30,290
I just looted the old fashioned way.

1252
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,870
I'm so freaking... I was like, it was just reflex.

1253
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,770
It was actually just reflex for me to loot the first thing I see.

1254
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,910
I was like, ooh, gold helmet.

1255
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,990
That's a nice loot there.

1256
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,090
Whoops.

1257
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,370
Did not mean to press my Q.

1258
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,590
What a team player.

1259
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,310
That's a weird looking shield cell.

1260
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,470
Alright, what else can I steal from there?

1261
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,370
Wait, this is so convenient.

1262
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,530
I can just casually steal things.

1263
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,410
Alright, let's see.

1264
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,130
Eh, let's grab the scope actually.

1265
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,330
Wait, did he took the scope?

1266
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,770
Wait, he took the scope!

1267
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,410
There was a scope right here!

1268
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,390
He actually took it!

1269
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,610
That fucking madman.

1270
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:16,730
Okay.

1271
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:19,530
Alright.

1272
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:20,490
Wait, they took it down?

1273
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,010
No, I took it down!

1274
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:22,410
Whoops.

1275
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,530
That was...

1276
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,050
That was an accident actually.

1277
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,750
I was like, wait a minute, where did it go?

1278
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,070
Wait, it's one guy.

1279
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,770
I think it's one guy.

1280
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,630
Yeah, we were...

1281
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,850
No, it was not one guy.

1282
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,590
I didn't get one guy.

1283
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,730
I knew I didn't get one guy.

1284
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,430
Watch this guys.

1285
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,960
I did it.

1286
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,580
Did you watch it?

1287
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,540
I told you.

1288
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,140
Look at that.

1289
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,600
He died without me even looking at him.

1290
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,060
Oh my god.

1291
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,740
Oh my god.

1292
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,760
I watched it.

1293
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:05,900
Nice.

1294
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,500
What?

1295
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,660
What happened?

1296
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,200
I was so good that he died from my mere presence.

1297
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,040
That was how good I am.

1298
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,820
Look, middle of the pack.

1299
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,580
I take those.

1300
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,160
I take middle of the pack.

1301
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,820
Incredible.

1302
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,300
Amazing battery.

1303
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,700
What a fucking gamer.

1304
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,500
I know.

1305
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:26,980
Wait.

1306
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,180
I think I got a cool... I got a cool icon.

1307
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,220
What was it?

1308
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,440
I got a cool badge.

1309
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,020
What the fuck?

1310
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,880
Oh, I was like, what is that?

1311
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,060
I've never seen this before.

1312
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,780
Where's like the legend badges?

1313
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,460
Okay.

1314
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,800
Where is it?

1315
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,780
No, I won't be able to... No, I gotta win!

1316
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,080
I gotta win!

1317
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,060
It's the same team!

1318
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,860
Fuck this shit.

1319
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,360
It's not you.

1320
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,060
I wanna play with new people.

1321
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,140
I wanna play...

1322
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,180
No, fuck it.

1323
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,120
It's not them.

1324
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,960
Guys, I just wanna play with new people.

1325
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,520
Not three times in a row.

1326
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,080
Okay, where is the legend badge?

1327
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,000
To show people how much of a gamer I am.

1328
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,400
Okay, only things I've unlocked.

1329
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,140
Where is it?

1330
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,900
Where's my face?

1331
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,580
What the fuck?

1332
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,040
I thought I unlocked it.

1333
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,880
Did I not unlock it?

1334
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:30,820
What?

1335
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,220
Where?

1336
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,560
Where is it?

1337
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,040
Okay, let's see.

1338
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,160
What did it look like again?

1339
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,500
It was like... Oh, there it is.

1340
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:39,840
Alter.

1341
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,400
There you go.

1342
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,300
Now they know I... Oh, now they know I won a game.

1343
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,140
Cosmic, thank you.

1344
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,540
Super chat, thank you.

1345
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,180
Sorry, I got... Sorry, I got it in my...

1346
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,980
Bro, fucking...

1347
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,540
Wait, what?

1348
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,320
Oh, JetPlay, man.

1349
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,640
He wanted to play Rive 2.

1350
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,520
Didn't he?

1351
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,920
Just keeps happening.

1352
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,600
No!

1353
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,020
I should just leave.

1354
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,560
I should just leave.

1355
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,380
Fuck this man.

1356
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,820
Yeah, where the fuck is your Pred Badge?

1357
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,140
JetPlane, man.

1358
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,420
You really deserve to... Are you...

1359
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:31,980
Are you even... Are you even Chinese?

1360
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,880
That's making... I should be able to play...

1361
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,120
Doki is tired of hard carrying.

1362
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,220
I'm eating tangerine.

1363
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,120
Tangerine.

1364
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,200
Tangerine.

1365
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,440
Tangerine.

1366
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,600
Uh...

1367
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,740
True.

1368
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,040
Damn, can't keep it up.

1369
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,260
I should get first choice.

1370
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,000
Cancel that guy.

1371
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,420
Right now!

1372
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,120
They're pulling my streamer privilege.

1373
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,900
Oh my god.

1374
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,180
There's no gun.

1375
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,240
Right bitch.

1376
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,340
Shit on.

1377
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,720
Oh shit, I'm gonna get shit on.

1378
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,820
Literally have a P20.

1379
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,960
Missed the first 50 minutes.

1380
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,860
Can you give me a rundown?

1381
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,060
I hit 100% the shots I took.

1382
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,580
That's a TLDR.

1383
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,180
You missed it, guy.

1384
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,100
You missed it, man.

1385
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,940
I won like five games in a row.

1386
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,880
Oh my god.

1387
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,100
Truly like the best streamer content out there.

1388
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,220
There is another team here cuz I got scanned.

1389
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,320
Are you a fucking coward?

1390
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,660
I literally like killed one of them.

1391
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,740
Why are you so scared of?

1392
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,280
Where could he be though?

1393
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,540
I know he's scanning me here.

1394
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,900
He... wait, I see his scans.

1395
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,260
I see you.

1396
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,540
I see you.

1397
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,520
You scan yourself.

1398
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,480
You revealed your location to me.

1399
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,740
I should grab this actually.

1400
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,660
I should grab the R9.

1401
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,120
Here?

1402
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,440
Whoa, don't worry.

1403
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:30,920
Don't worry.

1404
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,980
I'm gonna run into his face.

1405
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,860
Wait, where did he go?

1406
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,720
I did it.

1407
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,240
You saw that?

1408
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,840
I hit my shots.

1409
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,640
Wait, is he?

1410
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,300
Is she speaking Cantonese?

1411
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,560
Wait I... I can't tell.

1412
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,260
She said something that seemed like Cantonese.

1413
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:01,950
Does it matter?

1414
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,350
Yeah, she speaks canto.

1415
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,690
Yeah, I was like wait a minute.

1416
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:07,850
Wait a minute.

1417
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,130
That sounds so familiar.

1418
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,990
I couldn't exactly tell what she said, but like...

1419
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,370
Because it's like, not like...

1420
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,510
Loud enough, I guess?

1421
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,990
Are you running?

1422
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,990
Oh, you have friends!

1423
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,490
That's not fair!

1424
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,650
You should respect this 1v1!

1425
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,190
Oh god, oh god.

1426
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,030
Somebody's not respecting the 1v1!

1427
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,910
That's right, that's what you get for not respecting the 1v1.

1428
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:37,610
Oh, that's right!

1429
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,530
You can't fucking...

1430
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:39,870
Alternate it!

1431
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,250
He's right here!

1432
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,410
He's right here!

1433
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,650
He's right here!

1434
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:50,170
Don't die or you're fucking bad at this game and you should honest up!

1435
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,250
But not me, I wasn't bad.

1436
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,070
I just got... I just got 3-partied.

1437
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,870
That doesn't relate to me though.

1438
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,390
That doesn't relate to me.

1439
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,610
That's so cool though!

1440
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,390
She speaks Cantonese.

1441
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,670
I like, understand her.

1442
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,550
Totally not bad.

1443
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,290
It's not me!

1444
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:17,990
It's never me!

1445
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,550
I literally have streamer privilege!

1446
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,170
What's the point of being a streamer if I can't use this privilege?

1447
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,150
Like...

1448
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:30,830
What's the point?

1449
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,610
It's like when you're rich but you don't use any money.

1450
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,930
It's literally the same thing.

1451
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:35,910
Like...

1452
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,730
Like, what's the point?

1453
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,830
Okay, that was embarrassing.

1454
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,390
That's actually so bad.

1455
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,650
So Keanu Reeves...

1456
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:51,550
Wait, the resin!

1457
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,110
Don't let him do that to you!

1458
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,450
Oh!

1459
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,130
So true!

1460
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,450
His streamer privilege is denied.

1461
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,110
What?

1462
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,810
Rich people stay that way because they don't use money.

1463
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:06,730
What are you talking about?

1464
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,430
Okay, that is not true.

1465
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,990
Wait, he deseed?

1466
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,130
What?

1467
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:13,210
What?

1468
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,850
He fucking...

1469
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,370
Alright, we leave.

1470
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,210
We leave.

1471
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:22,870
We fucking leave.

1472
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,550
Wait, am I playing on...

1473
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,730
Okay, I'm playing on full screen.

1474
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,130
I guess we can try solos now.

1475
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,990
We'll try solos.

1476
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,730
There's no way that guy T's C.

1477
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,650
Dude, this finishers...

1478
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,070
I feel like there's like more characters with like...

1479
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,310
I feel like I've seen...

1480
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,510
I've seen like this finisher.

1481
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,010
Like this type of move done before.

1482
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,310
I'm trying to remember...

1483
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:55,570
Oh!

1484
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,730
Perfect Cell!

1485
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,410
That's what it reminds me of!

1486
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:03,650
It reminds me of a fucking Dragon Ball Z!

1487
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,010
Yeah, I was like wondering like why the fuck does that kill?

1488
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,830
Like it's so similar.

1489
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,290
It reminds me of like...

1490
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,250
More like Cell 1.

1491
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,910
Yeah, I think it's like Cell 1.

1492
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,990
Imperfect Cell.

1493
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,930
Yeah, his first form.

1494
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,290
Yeah, that's why I was like that's so familiar.

1495
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:32,390
It looks like the... like a Cell finisher.

1496
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,330
Yeah, now it makes sense.

1497
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,370
Is she girl boss Cell?

1498
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,050
Doesn't it like...

1499
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:43,250
It just reminds me of the animation for Cell.

1500
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,030
Oh yeah, nobody can steal it now.

1501
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,990
Um, Maya, thank you for the super chat.

1502
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:47,330
Thank you.

1503
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:55,470
Alert, if you are seeing this message, you are in danger of a mysterious life form known as a woman derogatory.

1504
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:56,830
Has breached containment.

1505
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,430
Do not engage.

1506
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,770
Lock all doors and windows.

1507
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,650
Your virginity is at risk.

1508
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,230
Thank you for the super chat.

1509
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:04,730
Thank you.

1510
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,370
Thank you.

1511
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,470
Alright, Solo time.

1512
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,790
Bracket derogatory.

1513
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:23,730
Let's see...

1514
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,310
We'll go...

1515
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:28,210
I wanna go...

1516
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,510
Where do I go?

1517
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:30,990
Where do people go?

1518
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,730
Okay, I'm gonna look at where all the other Solos go.

1519
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:34,650
And then like...

1520
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,470
Ooh, enemies nearby.

1521
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,930
Tells me where the enemies are.

1522
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:38,810
That's sweet.

1523
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,170
Alright, so they're all here fighting each other.

1524
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:44,410
I can take these little... little bit of loots here.

1525
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:46,350
Ooh, glue!

1526
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,610
Spitfire!

1527
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,530
That got me off my guard.

1528
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:51,890
Ooh!

1529
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,950
Oh, they're all like... it's all like...

1530
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:54,550
Uh...

1531
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,450
Oh, that's interesting.

1532
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,770
They're all like already kitted out.

1533
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,490
Oh, I like that.

1534
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,330
Okay, we'll grab the Havoc.

1535
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:04,910
And then we'll go in.

1536
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,310
I feel like playing as this character is not...

1537
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:12,770
5 years, 21 seasons and I'm still trash.

1538
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:13,610
My god.

1539
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:15,390
Poor guy.

1540
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:20,390
I don't know if playing as Alter would be good for this character.

1541
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,030
I don't know.

1542
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:22,790
For Soloist mode?

1543
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,110
I'm not sure if I like Soloist mode for Alter.

1544
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,790
It feels like... harder.

1545
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:28,550
Definitely...

1546
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,550
Oh, wait.

1547
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:29,750
What?

1548
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:32,150
Oh.

1549
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,110
Oh!

1550
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,130
What?!

1551
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:38,270
I... What happened?!

1552
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,770
What the f... I...

1553
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,490
Oh, I get to go again?

1554
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,110
Okay.

1555
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:52,430
What the f... happened?!

1556
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:56,290
I don't even... I don't even know what happened!

1557
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,470
I can't tell!

1558
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,670
What the f... just happened to me?

1559
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,850
It happened so fast!

1560
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,150
Am I gonna die here?

1561
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:08,190
It's fine.

1562
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:11,690
Okay.

1563
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,050
I see somebody over there.

1564
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,250
Alright, that's my death location.

1565
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:18,930
I was there.

1566
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,950
That's f-ing right?

1567
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,210
It's fine.

1568
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:25,270
Another team is shooting him.

1569
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,010
Wait.

1570
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:27,630
Oh, wait.

1571
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:29,130
What the f... I see you there.

1572
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:30,650
Okay, why is everyone...

1573
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:31,550
Why is everybody coming to me?

1574
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,070
This place is like no man's land.

1575
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,350
Oh, I see you in that smoke.

1576
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,070
I see you.

1577
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:42,210
There you go.

1578
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,010
I saved your life.

1579
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:46,090
Alright.

1580
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,330
Oh, f-!

1581
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:49,790
Oh, this isn't my life though!

1582
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:51,310
Bro!

1583
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,430
Bro, I saved your life!

1584
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:53,290
Where's my payback?

1585
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,290
Dude, I blinked and your health disappeared.

1586
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,690
That is a good question.

1587
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:00,170
What the f- happened to me?

1588
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:03,550
What if I just go here?

1589
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,250
Alright, there has to be a...

1590
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,570
Oh, there he is.

1591
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:10,130
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

1592
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1593
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,410
Wait, how many lives do I have?

1594
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:16,570
Oh, I get death recap!

1595
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:17,750
Okay.

1596
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,310
That was how many lives I have.

1597
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,190
Guys, I figured out how many lives I have.

1598
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,690
You get two lives.

1599
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,350
Okay.

1600
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:36,850
That's good.

1601
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,110
The best part of solo is that you need to carry yourself down.

1602
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,130
Thank you, SuperChacko.

1603
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:41,910
Thank you, thank you.

1604
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,510
I was totally carrying myself!

1605
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,450
Those two wins I got...

1606
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:48,570
I was not the... I was not the problem.

1607
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,990
Those games that I won...

1608
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:56,450
I was... I was a f-ing helper.

1609
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,670
I was middle of the pack helping you.

1610
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:05,370
You can requeue?

1611
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,970
Yeah, I keep forgetting to requeue.

1612
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:10,910
I was just so used to just going back to the menu.

1613
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,730
Ezreal, thank you for the 10 gifted ships!

1614
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,070
Thank you!

1615
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:17,230
Friend, thank you for the Super Chat!

1616
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:17,550
Thank you!

1617
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:19,850
I blanked myself for a sec and you...

1618
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,750
I blinded myself for a sec and you died.

1619
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:22,330
What happened?

1620
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:22,790
I won.

1621
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,250
I didn't die.

1622
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:28,650
You see, the great thing about blind people is that you can lie to them.

1623
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:29,670
You see, the great thing about blind people is that you can lie to them.

1624
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:35,930
Because they can't see.

1625
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,730
But I didn't lie to you friend.

1626
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:38,570
Of course.

1627
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:39,530
I would never lie to you.

1628
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,250
That was not a lie.

1629
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,370
Just so you know.

1630
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,230
That was not a lie.

1631
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,450
Who has a better trade-off?

1632
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,350
The PK and the alternator?

1633
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:58,450
Bro!

1634
01:04:58,690 --> 01:04:59,450
That's not

1635
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:04,400
right!

1636
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,160
What?

1637
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,400
That's messed up.

1638
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,700
Don't worry.

1639
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,900
Not just blind people.

1640
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,340
It works with deaf people too.

1641
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,400
That's funny.

1642
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,900
I didn't lie though.

1643
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,840
Not this time.

1644
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:26,600
Okay.

1645
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,460
I have an enemy near me.

1646
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,840
This is so fucked up.

1647
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,980
How come I get the charge?

1648
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,680
Where are my benefits?

1649
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:34,300
Oh!

1650
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,100
And then he gets the fucking...

1651
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,000
What was that?

1652
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:37,920
Is that spitfire?

1653
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,460
Yeah.

1654
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,500
Is that gray?

1655
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:40,940
I won.

1656
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:41,600
See?

1657
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,760
I hear him.

1658
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,700
He's like right over there.

1659
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,070
Here he is.

1660
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:53,730
I see him.

1661
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,590
He's just looting.

1662
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,140
Wait.

1663
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,240
I hear more than one.

1664
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:03,980
Bro!

1665
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,560
Fucking let me breathe!

1666
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,360
Fuck this.

1667
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,760
You guys fight each other.

1668
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,960
I'm going out of this portal.

1669
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,860
I'm going out of here.

1670
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,220
You guys fight each other.

1671
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,280
What?

1672
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,600
You fucker!

1673
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,240
You actual fucker.

1674
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,300
Bro.

1675
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,640
There's literally people right here.

1676
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:29,000
I can't believe it.

1677
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,400
You chased me all the way here!

1678
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,280
Where's the other guy?

1679
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,460
What?

1680
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,860
There's literally one other guy here!

1681
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,200
And he disappeared.

1682
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,460
Is he also blind?

1683
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:48,980
Gator, thank you.

1684
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,540
Thank you.

1685
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,460
How are you going to say that about blind people?

1686
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,060
Doki.

1687
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,220
I told my friend what you said and he typed.

1688
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,240
It was personal.

1689
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,580
I got a hug.

1690
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,100
I'm the only reason why.

1691
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,320
Dude.

1692
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:05,580
Okay.

1693
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,020
I'm going to say it.

1694
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,840
This character sucks for solos.

1695
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:15,920
Lance.

1696
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,540
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1697
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,240
Thank you.

1698
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:18,800
Thank you.

1699
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,340
Dude.

1700
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:19,860
I blinked.

1701
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,460
Doki.

1702
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,660
I blinked and you were running away.

1703
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,240
What happened?

1704
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,500
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1705
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,140
Thank you.

1706
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:24,720
Thank you.

1707
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,540
What I'm saying is that I picked the wrong legend.

1708
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,720
For this.

1709
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,540
I picked the wrong legend for a solo's mode.

1710
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,860
This is definitely not a solo's character.

1711
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,440
At least I had a conduit shield.

1712
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,940
It's like extra shield.

1713
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:46,780
What do you mean?

1714
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,260
Replicator coming down.

1715
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,320
I don't know actually.

1716
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,040
I'm trying to think what would be a good solo character.

1717
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:52,720
I guess like Bangalore.

1718
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:58,120
Bangalore or maybe Bangalore Wraith Pathliner.

1719
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,660
Just for the mobility.

1720
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,740
I feel like Alter is definitely a team character.

1721
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:05,900
Okay.

1722
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:06,820
There we go.

1723
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,500
We got it.

1724
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,840
We got Wingy and the Prowler.

1725
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,300
That is an improvement from a charged fucking rifle.

1726
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,620
Definitely a huge improvement.

1727
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,560
Oh my gosh.

1728
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:19,820
I hear so many shooting.

1729
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:20,500
Ooh.

1730
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,080
Okay.

1731
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:21,300
Wait.

1732
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,000
Actually...

1733
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,520
We'll go with this for now.

1734
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,120
Actually no.

1735
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:26,880
We'll go with this.

1736
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,040
I don't want to run double.

1737
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,980
I don't want to run double heavy.

1738
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:30,340
Alright.

1739
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:30,620
Let's go.

1740
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,920
Ginger, thank you for superchatting and thank you!

1741
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,820
I think you dropped this.

1742
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,460
Oh my god!

1743
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,480
Thank you for returning my $20 Ginger.

1744
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,760
I really appreciate it.

1745
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,680
It's crazy.

1746
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,080
I dropped so many cash today.

1747
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,400
It's actually...

1748
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,060
Okay.

1749
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,840
Am I getting shot by two people?

1750
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,760
Why am I always getting shot by two?

1751
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:02,600
Please!

1752
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,980
Why can't you get shot by two people?

1753
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,480
Oh my god, bro, I dropped so much money everywhere.

1754
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,500
It's like literally everywhere.

1755
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,600
Guys, can you help me find my money?

1756
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,340
I'm so sorry.

1757
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,100
Bro, okay, I swear if it's this guy, I'm fucking gonna try and...

1758
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,680
That's fucking right.

1759
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,120
Run!

1760
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,660
Run, you bitch!

1761
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,920
You seem like a guy that fucking shoots people in the backs.

1762
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:50,190
There you go.

1763
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,950
Oh, fucking hell, I'm so mad.

1764
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,810
Finally, I got an actual 1v1.

1765
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:02,650
Let's see.

1766
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,230
I finally got my own 1v1 and I won it.

1767
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,910
I told you it wasn't me!

1768
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,790
I kept getting shot in my back!

1769
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:12,210
It's you.

1770
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,350
That's right, it's not fun, right?

1771
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,330
It's not fun getting shot in the back, right?

1772
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,810
Wait, do I not have shields?

1773
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,760
There he is.

1774
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,260
No, no, no!

1775
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,980
That's not fair!

1776
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,660
I'm supposed to shoot people in the back!

1777
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,600
Hey, I found a random here.

1778
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,000
Says his blouse is yellow but also tomato, bird.

1779
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,220
I wonder who that is.

1780
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,880
Super, thank you for the super chat.

1781
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,600
Thank you, thank you.

1782
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,460
Okay, maybe...

1783
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:57,420
Okay, not a solo play... not a solo character.

1784
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,040
Alright, fuck this.

1785
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,860
Wait, not... wait, what?

1786
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,420
I picked Bangalore...

1787
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,900
Oh, wait, what?

1788
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,640
That was so weird.

1789
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,100
Guys, thank you for finding my money, guys.

1790
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,360
I'm returning it back here.

1791
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,700
Thank you guys so much.

1792
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:12,900
Thank you for the super chat.

1793
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:13,960
Thank you, thank you.

1794
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,200
The crutch character.

1795
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,960
Is this yours, ma'am?

1796
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,540
It was stuck in the blind person's pocket.

1797
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,780
Mr. Broken butt.

1798
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,460
Thank you for the akka super.

1799
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,860
Thank you, thank you.

1800
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,520
Oh my god, thank you everybody for finding my lost money.

1801
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:38,440
A fucking gorse from the person you least expected.

1802
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,900
A blind person.

1803
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,280
Bro...

1804
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,980
Oh my god, thank you everybody for finding my lost cash.

1805
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,860
Hey, I saw you dropped this but why do you have British currency?

1806
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:55,440
You know, I just like to collect money every so often, you know?

1807
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,760
Thank you for the super chat.

1808
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:57,800
Thank you, thank you, Leon.

1809
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,220
I just like to collect.

1810
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,860
It's like collecting coins except like money.

1811
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,600
This time, this time will be different.

1812
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,840
Blind people being put on blast.

1813
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:12,660
Hey, hey!

1814
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,460
It's not just blind people but also deaf people.

1815
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,140
Yes, collecting money.

1816
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:24,580
Alright.

1817
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:29,800
I fucking swear if you guys get a better gun than me, I swear to god.

1818
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:33,960
Where is he?

1819
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,500
There's two people here.

1820
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,480
This is fucked up.

1821
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,340
Oh, he ran away.

1822
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,100
He took a zip.

1823
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,300
Okay, thank god.

1824
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,620
One enemy nearby.

1825
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,920
I hear him.

1826
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,520
Please make this an actual 1v1.

1827
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,220
That's all I ask for.

1828
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,720
For BoBat.

1829
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,300
Oh my god.

1830
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,600
But you're worse.

1831
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,300
You're actually worse.

1832
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,380
Holy shit.

1833
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,960
Oh my god.

1834
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,540
Poor guy.

1835
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,420
This is it.

1836
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,680
This is it.

1837
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,460
A proper 1v1.

1838
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,300
They've told me about this.

1839
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,320
No, that's not a proper 1v1 anymore.

1840
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,040
I saw him running over.

1841
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:27,580
Yeah.

1842
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,400
I saw.

1843
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:30,880
I was like...

1844
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,760
Oh my god.

1845
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,420
It's not a proper 1v1 again.

1846
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,110
Come on.

1847
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,170
Wanna chill?

1848
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,430
You fucker.

1849
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,150
You fucker!

1850
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:55,690
You came back!

1851
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:59,050
He came back!

1852
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,650
You bitch!

1853
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:03,550
Why?

1854
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:07,130
You want to have a proper 1v1?

1855
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:10,650
It's the same.

1856
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:12,110
He came back for revenge!

1857
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,330
Bro, okay.

1858
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:17,170
Bro, fuck this two lives bullshit.

1859
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:18,610
It should be one life.

1860
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,870
Like, it should be one life.

1861
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,690
Because they get to play like a fucking pussy.

1862
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,810
Like, this shit sucks!

1863
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,150
This is bullshit!

1864
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,010
This is bullshit!

1865
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,930
They come back for revenge!

1866
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,090
Just like what I'm about to do.

1867
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:42,130
Where is he?

1868
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:44,530
Where the fuck is he?

1869
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,550
There's no way I'm the last third party here.

1870
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,010
There's no fucking way.

1871
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:51,910
Oh my god.

1872
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,390
They actually came back.

1873
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,690
I... Bro!

1874
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,410
This fuck sucks!

1875
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,070
Like...

1876
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,620
Like every time!

1877
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,160
Every time I shoot one...

1878
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:22,200
Every time I shoot one shot, I get shot in the back.

1879
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,920
Get out of the way.

1880
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,340
This... Bro!

1881
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,560
This keyboard fucking sucks!

1882
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,600
Everyone should have one life.

1883
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,180
Like, it's just cause they'll come back!

1884
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,880
They keep coming back!

1885
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,860
That's just bad luck.

1886
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:45,240
Everyone... Yes, but I don't think... Okay, I'll show you guys how having Bloodhound would not change anything.

1887
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,440
It will not change anything.

1888
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,500
People will still fuck me over.

1889
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:03,040
Always expect a third party.

1890
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,780
Bro, it's like non-stop!

1891
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,220
That's the worst part!

1892
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:13,270
Bro!

1893
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,910
Like...

1894
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,730
They're shooting me in the back!

1895
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,070
The dead should stay dead!

1896
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,750
The dead should stay fucking dead!

1897
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,730
Like, what is this bullshit?

1898
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:25,410
They keep coming back!

1899
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:27,690
And shooting me in the fucking back!

1900
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,890
I'll be back.

1901
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:34,390
Okay, there's three people here.

1902
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:37,410
Surely those two will fucking shoot each other.

1903
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:38,250
Right?

1904
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:41,790
Oh my god.

1905
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:43,650
Let me land in the middle of these guys.

1906
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,150
Surely... I fucked up a little.

1907
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:48,110
Okay.

1908
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:51,830
I'll be in here now.

1909
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,610
I'm gonna live underneath you.

1910
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,290
Wait, I could go here.

1911
01:16:58,850 --> 01:16:59,390
Bye.

1912
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:02,110
Wait, he's gone.

1913
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:05,050
Okay.

1914
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,470
It's not that bad right now.

1915
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,430
Okay, they're shooting each other.

1916
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:11,950
They're shooting each other.

1917
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:12,430
That's good.

1918
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,150
That's so good.

1919
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:15,550
Wait, okay.

1920
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,290
I got a plan.

1921
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:17,970
I got a plan.

1922
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:24,430
Wait, this is a good plan!

1923
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,230
This plan is brilliant!

1924
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:30,650
You can't third party me if I shoot from the distance!

1925
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:34,610
Alright.

1926
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,690
Okay.

1927
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:36,210
Here we go.

1928
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,710
Alright, this is it.

1929
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:38,630
I'll just stop.

1930
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:42,960
I'll just stop.

1931
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,400
Shit!

1932
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,960
I'll just stop pushing people.

1933
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:48,760
I'll just stay here.

1934
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,220
I'll just fucking stay here.

1935
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,320
Listen, we discovered the play.

1936
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,000
This is how we gotta play this.

1937
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,960
If I just stay here.

1938
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,280
Don't push up.

1939
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:06,880
Don't push up!

1940
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:07,580
I have a sniper!

1941
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,540
Don't push up!

1942
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,020
Don't push up!

1943
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:15,040
Oh god.

1944
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,940
Oh god, he came back for revenge.

1945
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,140
Don't push up!

1946
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,020
I have a sniper!

1947
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,540
Where are they coming from?!

1948
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,420
There's no way he pushed up, right?

1949
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,780
There's no way.

1950
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,560
Why are they all coming to me?

1951
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,320
Guys.

1952
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:37,620
Guys, look.

1953
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,240
I'm... I'm...

1954
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:41,740
There we go.

1955
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,420
Oh my god!

1956
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,940
He had the same plan!

1957
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:47,780
That's illegal!

1958
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:49,480
That was my plan!

1959
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:55,260
How can he have the same plan as me?!

1960
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,540
I don't... How did he have... What?!

1961
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,220
He also has the same plan!

1962
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,060
Why are they all sniping?!

1963
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,380
Bro!

1964
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,220
They're all stealing my ideas!

1965
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,040
This is so fucked up.

1966
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,760
They all stole my idea.

1967
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,540
Like, I had this idea first.

1968
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:20,960
Now everyone is sniping.

1969
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,400
I had... I had this idea first!

1970
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,180
Why are they all stealing from me?

1971
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,000
Oh wait, wrong one.

1972
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,460
It's okay, I'm better.

1973
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:32,800
No!

1974
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,440
No!

1975
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:34,740
No!

1976
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,300
He's so low!

1977
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,920
He was so low.

1978
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,540
I cracked one of them.

1979
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:47,700
No!

1980
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:48,080
Wait!

1981
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:48,940
Fuck off!

1982
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,660
Fuck off!

1983
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,000
I'm trying to snipe!

1984
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,360
This is so messed up.

1985
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,600
I can't believe my ideas got stolen.

1986
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,160
This is how...

1987
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,640
This is how my hero felt like.

1988
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,180
Like...

1989
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,800
Thomas Edison.

1990
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:14,720
This is how my hero felt.

1991
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,820
Where is he?

1992
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:21,860
Oh, he DC'd.

1993
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,440
Nice.

1994
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,460
Thank god.

1995
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,340
Should've batted him first.

1996
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,660
Is this the same guy?

1997
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:30,460
It is.

1998
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,560
Same guy that got shit on.

1999
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,020
Dude, the main is a sheep snake.

2000
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:36,980
Let's go.

2001
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,080
Thank you for the super chat.

2002
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:39,680
Thank you.

2003
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:40,200
Thank you.

2004
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,700
Keep complaining about them.

2005
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,860
Is he gonna peek me again?

2006
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:47,480
For stealing my fucking ideas?

2007
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,140
That's...

2008
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,920
That has to be a Tesla stat.

2009
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,300
Stealing ideas that are rightfully mine.

2010
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:00,400
Tesla dude got shit on twice.

2011
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,940
He got shit on and fucking ran away like a little bitch.

2012
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:05,340
Alright.

2013
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,060
Okay, let's see.

2014
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,960
He's still sniping!

2015
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,300
I literally saw him fucking sniping from 20 miles away.

2016
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,600
Look at him!

2017
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,800
He's still doing it!

2018
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:23,040
This is 180.

2019
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:29,370
Oh, he's like running away from me too.

2020
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,310
That's the funny part.

2021
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,050
I can't believe this is solo mode.

2022
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,290
This is the longest I've ever lived.

2023
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,090
Just cause I'm playing sniper.

2024
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:44,390
This is actually the longest I've ever lived.

2025
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,510
This is so sad.

2026
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,010
This is so sad.

2027
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:54,250
Where am I gonna shop from?

2028
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,930
I wonder where the Mirage guy is.

2029
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:59,430
I can't believe this Mirage guy has so many shields.

2030
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,210
That's like the craziest part for me.

2031
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,070
How does he still have the shields for this?

2032
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:07,130
No.

2033
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:08,890
Oh, no.

2034
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:10,710
No.

2035
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:13,630
No.

2036
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:18,950
You don't get to fuck me over here like this.

2037
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,670
That's fucking right.

2038
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,430
I'm a better sniper.

2039
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,650
That's fucking right.

2040
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:35,530
hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha I'm a better sniper.

2041
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:38,770
Bro, everybody here is just sniping!

2042
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:42,030
Bro!

2043
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:43,990
What?

2044
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,170
Why?

2045
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,910
Why?

2046
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,310
This is my area!

2047
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:49,270
Leave!

2048
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,190
Literally everybody here is sniping!

2049
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:01,650
Actually, leave me alone!

2050
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:04,610
I don't have shields anymore!

2051
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:07,370
Oh my gosh!

2052
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,850
Like, leave me alone!

2053
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:18,870
You started this, Doki!

2054
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:22,030
I didn't think everyone was gonna snipe!

2055
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,250
I literally have zero shields.

2056
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,370
Like, I'm just...

2057
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:35,950
How did these guys have the shields for this?

2058
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:39,770
Are you serious?

2059
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,530
People are in my home!

2060
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,410
Oh my god.

2061
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:46,850
People are...

2062
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:50,510
Bro, fuck off!

2063
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:03,460
I have one... I'm leaving... fuck this area.

2064
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,280
I'm actually leaving this area, bro.

2065
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,320
Fuck this place.

2066
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:09,320
I'm tired of fucking fighting.

2067
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,060
I'm tired of fucking fighting.

2068
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:10,060
I'm tired of fucking fighting.

2069
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,720
It's actually so dumb.

2070
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,880
Like, I'm actually so tired of fighting there.

2071
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,420
Like... Oh my god!

2072
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,940
Everybody's there!

2073
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,540
That's like the worst part!

2074
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,100
I like, need loot!

2075
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,900
Like, I forgot I still have two more lives... like, one more life.

2076
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,260
Oh my god, I can finally live in peace.

2077
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,120
Fucking finally.

2078
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:43,280
After being harassed for so long in that one area.

2079
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,820
But what if you... Bro, fuck that shit, bro!

2080
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:50,620
I'm not going back there!

2081
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:54,480
I got fucking harassed for so long that I couldn't leave!

2082
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,860
Like, I legitimately was stuck there for 20 years, I feel like.

2083
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,200
I've been tapped.

2084
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,640
This is the longest I've been alive.

2085
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:04,200
You know what?

2086
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:04,600
You're right.

2087
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:06,460
Maybe I should...

2088
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,340
Oh wait, he has a home there.

2089
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:13,840
Hey, but let me... Please, let me have my loot at least.

2090
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,080
Okay, I just want shield cells.

2091
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,240
I don't want anything else.

2092
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,780
Just give me those shield cells.

2093
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,840
God, it's a strafe!

2094
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,600
It's a strafe!

2095
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,240
I swear!

2096
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,700
I swear, the strafe is fucking me up!

2097
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,400
I swear!

2098
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,960
I wasn't whiffing.

2099
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,860
The strafe was so uncanny.

2100
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,800
I swear to god.

2101
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,480
I wasn't up with...

2102
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,500
It's strafes!

2103
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,820
It's the strafe patterns!

2104
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,640
Okay, I'm gonna grab this.

2105
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,780
Maybe I can snipe with this.

2106
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,800
Look, I lived for so long.

2107
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:06,880
Don't fucking see.

2108
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,840
With.

2109
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:13,240
This is the longest I've lived in this game.

2110
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,040
Oh my god.

2111
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:18,960
This is hell.

2112
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,660
I feel like solo mode is literally just sniping.

2113
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,960
This is not fun.

2114
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,240
I mean, I guess you can practice sniping, but still.

2115
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,900
This shit is bullshit.

2116
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,090
This is actually bullshit.

2117
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:38,690
This is the game mode now.

2118
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,170
This is solo mode.

2119
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:46,150
Are you fucking... Bro, please.

2120
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:47,490
Please.

2121
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:51,230
You and I both have to go to zone.

2122
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,040
You have to come down, sir.

2123
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,700
You're not in zone.

2124
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,420
That's fucking right.

2125
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,480
He's so confused.

2126
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,860
Oh, fucking hell.

2127
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:18,460
This is not fair.

2128
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,100
This is not fair!

2129
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,660
Are you serious?

2130
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:22,540
No!

2131
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,440
Fuck off!

2132
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,540
No!

2133
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,540
Bro!

2134
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:33,220
Where did the Bangalore go?

2135
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,160
Where the fuck is the Bangalore?

2136
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,980
I need to die.

2137
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,440
Snipe took you.

2138
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:43,180
But I really give it.

2139
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,520
But no, fuck this game.

2140
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,180
This game fucking sucks.

2141
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:52,760
This game fucking sucks.

2142
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,280
Fuck this game.

2143
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:59,780
It's either third party or sniping.

2144
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,280
That's it.

2145
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,140
It really is.

2146
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,900
Open the season.

2147
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,120
Good job on the sniper battle.

2148
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:11,660
I swear.

2149
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,520
Not gonna lie.

2150
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,500
I liked it.

2151
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,060
Until...

2152
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,060
Until...

2153
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,760
Until you get sniped by 20 people.

2154
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,880
Thank you for the super chat.

2155
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:22,320
Thank you.

2156
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,920
Then we'll see how much you like it.

2157
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,400
Alright, I'm gonna...

2158
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,460
Fuck it, I'll go call on you.

2159
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,720
I'll go call on you.

2160
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,380
I won't steal people's characters anymore.

2161
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,860
Oh my god.

2162
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,980
It's fucking a bullshit.

2163
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,700
It actually is.

2164
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,280
Actually so fucking bullshit.

2165
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:50,660
It's not fair.

2166
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,760
It's not fair at all.

2167
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:59,960
As an introvert Apex player, I like this game mode.

2168
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:02,660
As a fucking M you like this game mode.

2169
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,680
Bro I still can't believe that one area landed on and everybody was just sniping each other.

2170
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,860
They're from each building.

2171
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,900
Each building just had its own sniper.

2172
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:24,510
Alright, here you go.

2173
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:29,170
It's not fair because they always come back!

2174
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:33,150
Because when you kill them, they're gonna come back and shoot you in the back.

2175
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:39,550
And they always arrive when I'm in a fight.

2176
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:41,990
They always arrive when I'm in a fight.

2177
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:42,930
That's the worst part.

2178
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:45,490
That actually is the worst part.

2179
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:49,350
They don't wait until, you know, to do a respectable 1v1.

2180
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:52,790
They're like, no, I'm gonna fuck this person so hard.

2181
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,450
Get her out of that lobby.

2182
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:57,650
Fuck her, I hate that bitch.

2183
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,450
A lot of people are using Mozambique.

2184
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:02,030
Is it good now?

2185
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:04,950
Is there anybody here?

2186
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:08,630
I don't think anybody's here.

2187
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:11,430
I mean...

2188
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:13,410
I don't think anybody's landing here.

2189
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:14,270
He's so awesome.

2190
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:15,870
There's so many people running Mozambique.

2191
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:16,730
Is it good or not?

2192
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:21,770
By now.

2193
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:25,150
I don't think so.

2194
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:26,350
Because none of this is loot...

2195
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:27,010
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

2196
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:28,210
JK.

2197
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:30,370
JK.

2198
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,370
There's a Caustic here.

2199
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:35,210
On me?

2200
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:38,970
Okay.

2201
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:39,550
Whoa.

2202
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:42,610
No!

2203
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:43,230
He's one!

2204
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:44,850
Please!

2205
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:47,250
Please, he's one!

2206
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,910
Do the right thing!

2207
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:51,830
And clutch!

2208
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:53,610
There you go, he did it.

2209
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:54,950
He did the right thing, guys!

2210
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:56,370
No, that's one guy.

2211
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:58,230
No, he just knocked one person out.

2212
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:58,670
I'm Res me.

2213
01:30:58,710 --> 01:30:59,230
I'm so Res-able.

2214
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:00,810
Guys, look at me.

2215
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:01,630
I'm so Res-able.

2216
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:02,330
This is what you get.

2217
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,510
He was literally one HP.

2218
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:04,550
This is what you fucking get.

2219
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:05,310
Fucking please.

2220
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:06,150
Where's our third?

2221
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:08,090
Oh my god, where are you?

2222
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,110
Save this man!

2223
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:10,330
He's literally right here!

2224
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:12,070
He's on my door!

2225
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,750
He wants to mess me up!

2226
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:15,730
He's right here!

2227
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:16,510
He wants to mess me up!

2228
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:17,610
Oh no, he doesn't.

2229
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:18,270
He's just running.

2230
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,350
I think he's gonna lose this.

2231
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:24,730
He's definitely gonna lose this 1v1.

2232
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,170
There's no way he wins this.

2233
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,270
There's no way.

2234
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,770
There's no way he wins.

2235
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:30,090
Okay.

2236
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:36,490
I fucking knew it.

2237
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,990
There's actually no way he wins this.

2238
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:50,470
All I'm saying is that if he-if that man was there with us...

2239
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:52,150
I got my 1.

2240
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:54,510
I got my 1v1.

2241
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:59,910
I don't know about you, but I got my 1.

2242
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:01,910
It's always my team.

2243
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:02,610
It's never me.

2244
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:04,270
Always remember that, Dokie.

2245
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:06,570
Every time you die, it's never your fault.

2246
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:12,670
You're gonna be the new coach for TSM?

2247
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:15,910
Okay, first off, we gotta-we gotta have a team first.

2248
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:27,490
It doesn't seem like there's going to be a TSM team at the moment.

2249
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,230
That's actually crazy, though.

2250
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,290
That's actually crazy.

2251
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:42,410
Like, cause like, TSM has been like a team together for so long.

2252
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:45,050
Too soon!

2253
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:47,650
Damn!

2254
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:53,450
Please, let me play ulti!

2255
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,050
I just wanna play ulti!

2256
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:58,930
Oh, sorry.

2257
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:01,050
I upped the game volume a little bit, so I don't know.

2258
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:03,150
Uh...

2259
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:05,650
Let me tell my sound guy.

2260
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,230
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2261
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:15,270
I don't know if it's like too loud or-now or like if it's better now.

2262
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:16,970
Introducing your champion.

2263
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:19,830
TSM made this ban only-yeah.

2264
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:23,150
There's rumors that TSM-oh my god, that's such a cute banner!

2265
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:24,630
Wait, that's such a cute banner!

2266
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:27,350
Uh, there's rumors that TSM made this ban.

2267
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:32,110
And I feel like-I feel like-I feel like it might actually happen.

2268
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:36,250
Because those tweets-those tweets from reps and bros is so sus.

2269
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,500
Like, why would they tweet that?

2270
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,260
Only in Apex, yeah.

2271
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,300
It's just Apex.

2272
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,060
Apex rumors.

2273
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,020
They landed on me?

2274
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:54,780
No they haven't.

2275
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,560
I'm okay.

2276
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,440
Okay.

2277
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,220
Alright, 9, Havoc.

2278
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,740
And then, got my guns.

2279
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,220
Got what I need.

2280
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,040
Let's fight!

2281
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,460
Surely I won't get plucked over here, right?

2282
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:09,000
Nope.

2283
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,360
I knew it.

2284
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,040
I knew I'd be okay.

2285
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,440
Alright, Havoc.

2286
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:16,540
Really?

2287
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:17,060
Where?

2288
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:29,980
Wooo!

2289
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:31,760
I'm gonna stand here.

2290
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,480
I don't think they know I'm here now.

2291
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,620
If they know I'm here, they're stream sniping.

2292
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,020
What the fuck was that?

2293
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,060
Wait, how do I get back though?

2294
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,200
Oh, that's how.

2295
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,360
Oh, that spray was not-oh!

2296
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,440
Okay, that's fine.

2297
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,720
That was not a good-WOOOOO!

2298
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,780
That's not fine!

2299
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:55,060
Wooo!

2300
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,740
That was-that was not-I'm okay now.

2301
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,900
Okay, we got a little merry-go-round.

2302
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:10,840
It's okay, we're fine.

2303
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,320
See, I told you we're fine!

2304
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,300
Nothing to worry about.

2305
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,680
Alright, we're gonna...

2306
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,940
That R9 was not attractive right there.

2307
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:22,840
I need to get rid of this.

2308
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:25,380
Okay.

2309
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,000
Let's see...

2310
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:30,880
Calculate-it was so calculated.

2311
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,500
Of course it was!

2312
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:34,500
Of course it was calculated.

2313
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,780
I'm a gamer!

2314
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,440
Oh, wait, alternator.

2315
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,040
Oh, wait, no, they already used the disruptor.

2316
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,000
Alright, we're fine.

2317
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,360
We're so okay.

2318
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:53,700
Let's see...

2319
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,740
I really wanna try-wait, we have hammerpoint, right?

2320
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,160
Wait, actually...

2321
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,120
I remember I saw a hammerpoint back there.

2322
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,640
I'm gonna grab it.

2323
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,740
Is R9 even good?

2324
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:08,460
No, but I'm, like, coping.

2325
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:09,660
At the moment.

2326
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,220
It's not.

2327
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:17,600
I'm just...

2328
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,520
I'm just going through nostalgia with the R9.

2329
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:24,680
That's why I got the...

2330
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,180
That's why I got the vault.

2331
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:28,600
Alright.

2332
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,940
Back to the old days.

2333
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:32,720
Bring me back.

2334
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,820
Give me my nostalgia bait.

2335
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,880
Please, I don't have anything else.

2336
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,040
Let's see...

2337
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,180
Care package over there.

2338
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,640
Let's just go somewhere, guys.

2339
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:44,720
Let's leave.

2340
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:46,980
There's clearly no other teams here.

2341
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,600
Yay!

2342
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,200
I'm just gonna go straight.

2343
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,380
I'm just gonna go straight here.

2344
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,440
And also grab the armor.

2345
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,460
There's no way I get shot in the air, right?

2346
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,260
There's no way I land into three teams.

2347
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,480
Like, my bad luck is not that bad.

2348
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,480
Give me season...

2349
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:14,380
Okay, we're not going that further back, bro.

2350
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,640
We're going back, but that's way...

2351
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,720
You went too far.

2352
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,280
That's a bit too far, bro.

2353
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,980
I heard, like, shots here.

2354
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,280
Let's see.

2355
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:36,640
On me?

2356
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,220
The fuck is this?

2357
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:40,920
Are they, like, rapping?

2358
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:41,880
Like, what is that?

2359
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:43,560
Pop, pop.

2360
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:44,520
Oh, fuck!

2361
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,700
Okay, there is a chance that my bad luck is that bad.

2362
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,440
It's me, me.

2363
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:54,420
Hahaha.

2364
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,520
I'm putting off all the defenses right now.

2365
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:01,520
Are you serious?

2366
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,020
They were, in fact, serious.

2367
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,320
Oh, wait.

2368
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,320
I helped.

2369
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:10,600
Oh, God.

2370
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:11,940
I did it!

2371
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,900
Oh, my God!

2372
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:15,820
You're welcome.

2373
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,100
You're absolutely welcome.

2374
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,240
I feel like I deserve all that loot for everything I did.

2375
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:26,840
Okay, I heard, like, shots from here.

2376
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:27,900
There they are.

2377
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,000
Okay, I forgot I'm climbing up this.

2378
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:38,880
Holy shit, I did it, guys!

2379
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,320
I clutched.

2380
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,220
I assisted.

2381
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:48,440
Watch this.

2382
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:53,910
Did you watch it?

2383
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,150
Hahaha!

2384
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:56,050
Hahaha!

2385
01:38:58,590 --> 01:38:58,990
Hahaha!

2386
01:39:00,490 --> 01:39:02,150
I told you to watch this.

2387
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:05,150
Oh, fuck, don't watch.

2388
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:07,170
Did you watch it, though?

2389
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,270
I got my one.

2390
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:22,210
Did you watch it?

2391
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:23,270
I got my one, guys.

2392
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:27,510
Okay, we are going to get rid of the hammerpoint moves.

2393
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:31,010
We are gonna get rid of the hammerpoint moves.

2394
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,850
I realized we're at more...

2395
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:40,670
Guys, I realized like...

2396
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:42,990
My place.

2397
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:48,610
Guys, no, no, no.

2398
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,490
I didn't panic.

2399
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:51,810
I didn't panic because I got my ones.

2400
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:54,250
I got my ones.

2401
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:55,710
Wait, what the fuck?

2402
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:56,130
It disappeared.

2403
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:57,770
Wait, that's so cool.

2404
01:39:59,010 --> 01:39:59,850
Wait, what?

2405
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:02,090
How did he get over there?

2406
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:03,690
Wait, what?

2407
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,200
How did he get over there?

2408
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:11,180
Holy shit, what?

2409
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,240
Oh my god, you can do that?

2410
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,600
Because I think he knows how to... Oh, was that... No, that's not an ult.

2411
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:23,760
Was that the ult?

2412
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,480
No way, that can't be the ult.

2413
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,280
Because I saw the portal.

2414
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,740
I thought that was his Q.

2415
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:38,720
Oh, it was?

2416
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,380
Okay, I thought that was the Q.

2417
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,420
I was like so surprised.

2418
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:42,400
Like, what the fuck?

2419
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:47,010
Alright.

2420
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:51,830
I was like, there's no way he travels that far.

2421
01:40:53,210 --> 01:40:55,690
Oh my god, I'm fucking holding too many syringes.

2422
01:40:59,310 --> 01:40:59,710
Doink.

2423
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:04,330
Let me grab this for everybody because I'm a team player.

2424
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:06,810
Yay!

2425
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,280
Where the fuck are the rest of the teams?

2426
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,440
Guys, I need to break 1k.

2427
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,740
Guys, I fucked up a lot.

2428
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,200
Whoa, why am I so fast?

2429
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:22,560
That arrow made me so fast.

2430
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,160
My momentum was crazy there.

2431
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,150
Let's see, we need that.

2432
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:35,830
Uh...

2433
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:37,750
Anything for me?

2434
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:39,510
Yoink.

2435
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:42,530
Where is the team?

2436
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:43,550
Okay, we have to go back.

2437
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:45,830
This is not even in the...

2438
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:50,310
No, it wasn't my passive though.

2439
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,170
That's the thing.

2440
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:53,570
Because everybody was close by.

2441
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:57,610
Everyone was so close to me.

2442
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,410
It can't be my passive.

2443
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:01,390
I think it's the momentum of the stairs.

2444
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,970
Yeah.

2445
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:04,410
Wait, what?

2446
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:08,410
The momentum of the stairs made me so fast.

2447
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:16,340
Yeah, it's the stairs.

2448
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,300
The stairs actually made me go zoom.

2449
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,480
Whoa!

2450
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:20,660
Don't worry!

2451
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:22,780
You're okay!

2452
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,680
Wait, where are they?

2453
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:30,370
Where the fuck are they?

2454
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,960
They have to come here, right?

2455
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:37,100
There's no way that hits me.

2456
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,660
I told you, there's no way that hits me.

2457
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,700
No way this hits me too.

2458
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,460
I have the high ground.

2459
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:48,860
Push in!

2460
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:49,480
Push in!

2461
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,260
Come on, push in!

2462
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:54,820
Oh, we should be able to push in now with this.

2463
01:42:59,170 --> 01:42:59,750
Oh, God.

2464
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:00,830
Oh, God.

2465
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:01,450
Alright.

2466
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:03,690
Okay, goodbye!

2467
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:08,470
Okay, goodbye!

2468
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:23,750
Not the dead zone!

2469
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,260
Oh, no!

2470
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:33,030
The fucking dead slide!

2471
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:34,750
No!

2472
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:37,790
Oh, my God.

2473
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:40,770
I can't believe I got dead slid so hard.

2474
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:42,270
I got my one.

2475
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:45,690
All I'm saying, I got my one.

2476
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:47,150
Where the fuck were there one?

2477
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:49,290
Not the slide.

2478
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,520
Oh, no!

2479
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,260
My dead slide!

2480
01:43:58,980 --> 01:43:59,660
It fucked up my slide.

2481
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:00,420
It fucked everything up!

2482
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,360
It fucked everything up!

2483
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:03,500
Everything went...

2484
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,060
That could...

2485
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:04,720
Oh, my God.

2486
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:07,300
This guy is a fucking top 17 Pred.

2487
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,820
Bro, what are you doing?

2488
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:10,840
Don't you want Pred again?

2489
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,240
Bro, don't you want...

2490
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,160
The dead slide!

2491
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:17,320
No!

2492
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,260
I told you it's not me.

2493
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:22,440
It's the game.

2494
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,240
The game's sabotaging me.

2495
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:28,820
The game's sabotaging me.

2496
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:28,980
The game's sabotaging me.

2497
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:29,640
The game's sabotaging me.

2498
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,740
It's the game.

2499
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,420
It's sabotaging me.

2500
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:35,320
Oh, my God.

2501
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:35,720
He talks.

2502
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,720
I guess any gun.

2503
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,400
They're talking to each other.

2504
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,180
They're letting each other know what guns they want.

2505
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,220
What's a dead slide?

2506
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:47,900
It's like when you try to slide for momentum, but you don't get the momentum.

2507
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:51,320
That's what it is.

2508
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,360
That's the dead slide.

2509
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:55,840
He speaks.

2510
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:57,600
He has a mouth.

2511
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:58,940
Isn't that crazy?

2512
01:44:59,180 --> 01:44:59,620
Oh, my God.

2513
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:00,900
A fucking mouth.

2514
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:06,860
Holy shit.

2515
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,800
That's insane.

2516
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:15,980
Alright.

2517
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:16,980
Please!

2518
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,880
I just wanna play Alter!

2519
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,940
Give me Alter!

2520
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,540
That's right, you don't even get Conduit.

2521
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:27,320
If I can't get Alter, you can't get Conduit.

2522
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,520
Number three.

2523
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:29,920
Hahaha.

2524
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:35,640
Yeah, it's the slide, but you don't get the actual slide part.

2525
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,960
It's pretty sad.

2526
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,900
I shouldn't have communicated.

2527
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,020
Look.

2528
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:50,320
You can tell I get worse every season because...

2529
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,180
What?

2530
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,800
Wait, this is a three...

2531
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,340
What?

2532
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,320
This is a three man fucking pred team!

2533
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,580
You see, I like my... like...

2534
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,960
Every season, I get worse because my badges get lower.

2535
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,920
Alright, here we go.

2536
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:16,280
Where's my pred players?

2537
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:17,260
Where are they?

2538
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,400
Where are my pred players?

2539
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,360
JinJin, thank you for the super chat.

2540
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,160
Thank you, thank you.

2541
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,240
This is what happens when you get older?

2542
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:29,980
That is not true.

2543
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:31,780
That's a fucking lie.

2544
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:33,160
VTubers don't age.

2545
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:38,080
We're digital.

2546
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:39,100
We can't age.

2547
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:40,100
How dare you?

2548
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,900
You're fucking kidding here, bro.

2549
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,860
Alright, I should go to... my teammate.

2550
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,140
Oh shit.

2551
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,540
No way he sees me, right?

2552
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:56,680
Told you he doesn't see me.

2553
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:58,380
Oh, bloody ass teammates!

2554
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:01,120
Guys!

2555
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:02,800
Oh

2556
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:14,340
my...

2557
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,740
Wait, there's night...

2558
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:16,540
Okay, guys.

2559
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,680
Okay, I fucked up.

2560
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,520
There's another team.

2561
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,100
Guys, don't come over here.

2562
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:21,960
Everywhere I go, people die.

2563
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,420
And by people, I mean me.

2564
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,120
Oh, you bitch.

2565
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,980
You bitch, you have nothing in your life.

2566
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,480
Why are you thirsting?

2567
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,980
It's okay, I'll slowly crawl... I'm so safe.

2568
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:33,600
I'm so safe.

2569
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,180
I'm so fucking safe.

2570
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,640
Ignore that guy shooting at you.

2571
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:41,020
Ignore that guy shooting at you.

2572
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,320
Ignore that one guy that shot you.

2573
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,480
I'm so safe.

2574
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:48,360
Okay, now that you shot his friend, he might shoot me.

2575
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,760
There's another team there!

2576
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:53,040
Oh my... okay.

2577
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:55,740
Okay, he might shoot me because you shot his friend.

2578
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,000
Alright, I'm good.

2579
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:57,320
I'm good.

2580
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:57,620
I'm good.

2581
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:58,160
I'm so safe.

2582
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:00,680
I am not safe, but like, just pretend I am.

2583
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:07,220
He's really waiting for me there.

2584
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,080
Oh god.

2585
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,860
Surely he can't see that.

2586
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,200
He's really waiting for me there.

2587
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:13,400
Oh god.

2588
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:16,620
I did it.

2589
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,260
Are you kidding, bro?

2590
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:20,800
Me too, bro!

2591
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:22,780
I don't have med kits!

2592
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,620
Oh, no!

2593
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,200
Okay, I have no ammo.

2594
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:35,660
Oh my god, I actually have nothing.

2595
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,400
I have nothing right now.

2596
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:38,900
Got it, got it.

2597
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,060
All I have is my fucking repeater.

2598
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:43,260
Call over, she can fuck off.

2599
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:46,220
Okay, I thirsted one guy.

2600
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:50,120
I'm gonna loot this.

2601
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:50,920
Here's a med kit.

2602
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:51,560
Here's a med kit.

2603
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:52,260
I'm gonna drop a med kit.

2604
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,040
I have a med kit.

2605
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:54,820
Nice.

2606
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:56,080
I'm okay.

2607
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:57,860
I helped.

2608
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,400
I'm a team player.

2609
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:01,960
Never forget.

2610
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:03,780
Never back down.

2611
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:06,220
Okay, I'm gonna fucking...

2612
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,560
There's a full team right here on my ping.

2613
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,180
I'm gonna grab this.

2614
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,140
I don't have the ammo for this.

2615
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:14,040
No, you're not.

2616
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:14,600
No, you're not!

2617
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,280
Get out of there, John.

2618
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:20,280
Get out of there.

2619
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,240
That was a no-brake!

2620
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:22,100
I can't get out!

2621
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,160
I'm getting shot from under two.

2622
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,020
I've got the core.

2623
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,220
I've got the core.

2624
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:33,500
Oh!

2625
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,960
Where do you go from here?

2626
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,640
Where do we go from here?

2627
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,640
Oh my god!

2628
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,620
Oh my god!

2629
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,100
He's one.

2630
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,220
He's actually one.

2631
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,020
He's so low!

2632
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,520
He's right there still.

2633
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,160
Jump to the left.

2634
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:54,560
He's right here.

2635
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:55,660
He's fucking hot.

2636
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,280
Wait!

2637
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:56,660
That's...

2638
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:57,380
Fuck!

2639
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:58,340
Okay.

2640
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,200
Give me a sec.

2641
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:01,440
There's another team here.

2642
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:04,480
Bro, what the fuck is this?

2643
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,280
Bro, chill!

2644
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:09,980
Please!

2645
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:14,520
It's like TDM, bro.

2646
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:18,820
Oh my god!

2647
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:20,480
First

2648
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:25,520
time.

2649
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,040
Gucci liquor.

2650
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,560
Oh, this is where I die.

2651
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,780
What is that?!

2652
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:40,500
Holy shit!

2653
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:42,360
Don't worry, I'm here, bro.

2654
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:45,180
Wait, what the fuck was that war?!

2655
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:46,820
I never...

2656
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:49,880
Is this... Is this IHOP happening?

2657
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:50,680
What?

2658
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:52,340
Oh my god!

2659
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:58,840
I can't possibly know why I'm here right after I shot them.

2660
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:03,140
It was valiant but deadly.

2661
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,940
Thank you for the super chat.

2662
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:05,340
Thank you.

2663
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:05,960
Thank you.

2664
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:06,720
Thank you extremely.

2665
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,980
Oh, how many birthdays she has in a year.

2666
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:10,020
Thank you for the super chat.

2667
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:10,420
Thank you.

2668
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,280
It's merely just cosmetics, guys.

2669
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:13,660
It's really...

2670
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,600
Bro, chill.

2671
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:19,300
Oh my god.

2672
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,280
That shit was actually crazy.

2673
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,680
Holy fuck!

2674
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,700
Oh my god.

2675
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:28,780
It never stopped.

2676
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,760
The fight... fighting never stopped.

2677
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,920
I was getting shot from 20 different directions.

2678
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,760
There were shots from angles I didn't know existed.

2679
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:43,780
It was an online waffle house.

2680
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,580
It was absolutely insane.

2681
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:48,620
It was absolutely insane.

2682
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:50,080
Bro, what the fuck?

2683
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:52,720
Where's my fucking pred team?

2684
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:56,200
Where's my second and third player who's also pred?

2685
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:57,420
Where's my second and third player who's also pred?

2686
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:00,860
You can't get off Mr. Bone's wild ride.

2687
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,420
That shit was so fucking wild.

2688
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:12,190
I guess they all want to try out Broken Moon.

2689
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:12,570
I guess they all want to try out Broken Moon.

2690
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:14,510
They don't want to go through the teams.

2691
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:15,790
The pro teams.

2692
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:18,850
Weeee!

2693
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:23,870
Where are they landing?

2694
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:27,470
Ohhhhhhh my...

2695
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:29,230
Am I gonna get anything?

2696
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:32,330
Alright, this is where I die, most likely.

2697
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:35,470
Guys, this is exactly where I die.

2698
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:35,870
Guys, this is exactly where I die.

2699
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:37,050
WOOO!

2700
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:39,450
Wooo!

2701
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:40,630
I creature climbed.

2702
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:41,330
Wooooo!

2703
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:42,590
Haha.

2704
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:47,310
No, it's him!

2705
01:52:47,650 --> 01:52:48,710
We had a connection!

2706
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:51,130
We had a connection!

2707
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:52,910
You were in my team!

2708
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:08,330
I wasn't the first to die.

2709
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:10,190
Deathstalker was.

2710
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:12,110
No mercy.

2711
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:14,530
I thought we had something.

2712
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:18,190
I thought we had something, man!

2713
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:20,430
We were literally on a team to get there.

2714
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:24,310
How could you?

2715
01:53:25,230 --> 01:53:27,050
How could you do this?

2716
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:29,990
Oh my god, this was the Pred team anyway, so it doesn't matter.

2717
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:34,050
My team was not gonna survive that.

2718
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:36,050
You ditched him.

2719
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:42,590
I can't believe it.

2720
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:45,790
Did our fucking battle not meant anything?

2721
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:49,270
It didn't mean anything to this person!

2722
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:51,510
What the fuck?

2723
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:55,790
I'm gonna leave this team!

2724
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:59,990
I'm gonna leave this team!

2725
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:05,470
We're gonna leave it in the middle of everybody.

2726
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:10,470
Oh my god.

2727
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:12,630
I was destined to die there.

2728
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:15,590
I truly was destined to die there.

2729
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,540
Alright, that one guy.

2730
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,780
Okay, that's a little bit better than he was a little bit better.

2731
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,020
Alright, here we go.

2732
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:41,680
Oh man, I feel like this new game mode, this new season has made everybody fucking wild.

2733
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,660
Everybody's shooting at everything.

2734
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,500
Oh my god.

2735
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,300
There's no peace at all.

2736
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:56,540
Yay, I get to play Alter!

2737
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:57,440
Yay!

2738
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:04,860
Oh shit, wait, that's such a cool battle intro.

2739
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,740
Doki, you should have ever... That's different!

2740
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:14,660
It's called streamer privilege.

2741
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:17,300
What content are they making when they're shooting people?

2742
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,020
Think of it that way.

2743
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,780
Peace was not an intro.

2744
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,520
Exactly.

2745
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,980
They're not making content.

2746
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,060
I am!

2747
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:39,020
Alright.

2748
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:42,160
They're just having... fun?

2749
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:45,580
What's this word you're saying?

2750
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,120
Fun.

2751
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:53,660
Alright.

2752
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,200
Is that new streamer mode?

2753
01:55:57,380 --> 01:55:57,820
Yeah, it's new.

2754
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:58,480
Alright, let's see.

2755
01:55:58,780 --> 01:55:59,380
Give me a gun.

2756
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:00,140
Give me a gun.

2757
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:02,400
Nice.

2758
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,220
Give me another gun.

2759
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:06,160
I don't ask for much, just two guns.

2760
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:09,480
Okay.

2761
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:10,880
This is my redemption arc.

2762
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,460
JK, I'm not fucking running that.

2763
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:13,780
What the fuck?

2764
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:15,740
Where did I get shot from?

2765
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:19,260
Oh, from here.

2766
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:19,700
Watch this.

2767
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:22,920
Oh!

2768
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:23,580
Oh!

2769
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,040
I tried so hard.

2770
01:56:29,370 --> 01:56:29,720
Okay.

2771
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:31,800
Alright, this is awkward.

2772
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:38,560
That was a little awkward.

2773
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,100
Okay, I get that armor swap.

2774
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:52,080
Oh god.

2775
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:56,480
Okay, we're fine.

2776
01:56:58,600 --> 01:56:59,240
No!

2777
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,380
He used it against me!

2778
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:06,840
Okay.

2779
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,300
Okay, I fucked up because I pressed Q into two people.

2780
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,280
That was like... that was my oopsie.

2781
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:17,280
I used my walls into two people.

2782
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:23,360
And I got instantly shot at.

2783
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:24,880
That was so fucked up.

2784
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:27,460
I'm still learning!

2785
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:29,920
I'm still learning her abilities!

2786
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:30,780
Okay!

2787
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,420
Her abilities are hard to master!

2788
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:40,360
Her abilities... Oh wait, her teammates left her too.

2789
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:43,420
It's okay.

2790
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:46,500
We have Clifford the big red dog and Sonic the blue hedgehog.

2791
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,200
Surely nothing can go wrong.

2792
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:51,960
Oh my god!

2793
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:55,220
The crossover of a fucking century!

2794
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,300
Sounds like a skill issue.

2795
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:02,940
This is it.

2796
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:05,540
This is the crossover we needed.

2797
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:08,380
This is the crossover that will give us the win.

2798
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,440
The strong duo.

2799
01:58:10,580 --> 01:58:10,940
Yes.

2800
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:15,500
Like, with those names... with those names, this duo is unstoppable.

2801
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:19,160
I knew it!

2802
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:22,140
I knew Clifford would be a 4k 20 bomb.

2803
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,880
At his size?

2804
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,220
He could just... he could just squish them.

2805
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,480
Oh my god.

2806
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:31,720
He could just squish them with his sheer size.

2807
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:38,550
A bird, a dog, and a hedgehog.

2808
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,470
What could go wrong?

2809
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:42,230
God, that's one hell of a powerful team.

2810
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:45,270
Bro, he could kill 20 people with just one step.

2811
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:48,790
Clifford the big red guy.

2812
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:53,230
This has to be winnable.

2813
01:58:54,970 --> 01:59:01,650
Okay, actually I should not have peaced out because like, everybody lands here so I'm like a little scared.

2814
01:59:02,030 --> 01:59:03,650
Not gonna lie.

2815
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:06,010
I'm a little fucking scared.

2816
01:59:07,290 --> 01:59:07,950
Alright.

2817
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:13,110
Okay, into the hole I go.

2818
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:14,750
The hole is the goal.

2819
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:18,990
Three people sharing this one hole.

2820
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,010
Seems ideal.

2821
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:26,150
Surely nothing can go wrong when he does that.

2822
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:28,810
See?

2823
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:32,250
There we go.

2824
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:33,470
Nothing went wrong.

2825
01:59:35,870 --> 01:59:37,470
If I can go back up.

2826
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,470
Wait, how?

2827
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:38,930
What?

2828
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:43,090
I can but I just chose not to.

2829
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:46,010
Guys, I just chose not to go up.

2830
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:47,630
Wait, where are you?

2831
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:48,250
Oh, on me.

2832
01:59:50,910 --> 01:59:51,630
He's on me.

2833
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:54,770
Whoa.

2834
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:56,910
Okay, that was a cool hit fire.

2835
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:57,410
You gotta admit.

2836
01:59:59,690 --> 02:00:00,170
Nice.

2837
02:00:01,050 --> 02:00:01,950
Where's your teammate?

2838
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:04,750
Where is your teammate?

2839
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:09,210
Okay, we gotta get rid of...

2840
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:10,910
I wanna use the triple take.

2841
02:00:12,230 --> 02:00:12,710
Okay.

2842
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:16,990
Alright, so I don't have ammo for the triple take.

2843
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:17,610
That's okay.

2844
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:19,690
Choices and...

2845
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:21,050
...lose shit.

2846
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:24,630
No, I chose not to go that way.

2847
02:00:24,950 --> 02:00:26,230
Cause I wanted to flank.

2848
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:28,050
It was all a choice.

2849
02:00:29,010 --> 02:00:30,170
My choices matter.

2850
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:34,270
Where the fuck are... Oh, there it is.

2851
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:35,290
Nice.

2852
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:35,990
Alright, let's go.

2853
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:37,150
Let's flag.

2854
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,610
Here we go.

2855
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:41,870
Come on, Sonic!

2856
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:43,750
You got this!

2857
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:44,690
You gotta go fast!

2858
02:00:45,690 --> 02:00:46,950
Is he gonna do the thing?

2859
02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:47,590
What is he...

2860
02:00:49,110 --> 02:00:50,090
He's trying to...

2861
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:51,990
He's trying to go inside!

2862
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:56,070
He's like, fine, I'll use the door.

2863
02:00:58,930 --> 02:00:59,830
Oh, shit!

2864
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:04,710
I like how he's like, I guess I'll use the door.

2865
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:07,890
This is another team.

2866
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:15,600
Yeah, this is...

2867
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:20,910
Oh, God.

2868
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:24,090
I'm trying to cover.

2869
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:27,610
Alright, here we go.

2870
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:28,250
Don't worry, I got you!

2871
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:29,630
I got you!

2872
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:30,810
Cover me!

2873
02:01:31,190 --> 02:01:31,990
Cover me, Sonic!

2874
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:36,680
Okay, nice.

2875
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:40,080
The flank!

2876
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:42,580
Sonic, but the flank!

2877
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:43,380
Woah!

2878
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:44,760
Okay, that was a good name.

2879
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:45,240
Not gonna lie.

2880
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:51,320
That's why you're not getting rezzed.

2881
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,980
Because I need your loot.

2882
02:01:56,100 --> 02:01:56,700
Where is he?

2883
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,140
Is he gonna melee him?

2884
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:00,140
You'll be fine, right?

2885
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:00,400
Oh.

2886
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:01,860
I contributed.

2887
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:05,260
Let's see, I need that.

2888
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:08,000
I need like a Prowler, I feel like.

2889
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:09,520
Where's his teammate?

2890
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:11,620
Teammate!

2891
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:14,660
Teammate!

2892
02:02:16,060 --> 02:02:17,480
I mean, there's a spray.

2893
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:22,040
I see the spray.

2894
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:26,280
There's no way he's gonna shoot me while I craft, right?

2895
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,020
That'd be fucked up.

2896
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:30,040
It's like how like...

2897
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:33,420
Like, guys have like the bro code where you should never...

2898
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:34,620
No nutshots ever.

2899
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,340
And then this is like...

2900
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:37,540
This is the girl code.

2901
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:39,060
Never shoot somebody when they're crafting.

2902
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:39,920
That's...

2903
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:42,600
It's crazy.

2904
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:44,640
It can be applied to...

2905
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:45,700
It can be applied in any situation.

2906
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:50,720
That's the girl code.

2907
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:53,600
Or that way.

2908
02:02:53,700 --> 02:02:53,940
Okay.

2909
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,500
Is that how it works?

2910
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:55,680
Yeah.

2911
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,280
Let's show us our loud under some rules.

2912
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,000
That man is not a bro.

2913
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:07,920
Who said that?

2914
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,440
I always go, that's fucked up.

2915
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:14,000
You're not a bro, bro.

2916
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:16,960
Wow, girls are complicated.

2917
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:19,160
I did it.

2918
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:23,580
Look, I did it.

2919
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:25,080
You saw that?

2920
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:26,420
Zoinks, I killed him.

2921
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:28,180
Damn.

2922
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:31,840
You're never safe from a nutshot.

2923
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:35,960
Alright, let's see.

2924
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:37,920
I'm gonna grab this.

2925
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:39,960
And then...

2926
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,340
I'm helping.

2927
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,720
I need like a fucking prowler.

2928
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:46,400
I just...

2929
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:46,860
Oh, no!

2930
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,720
Oh, I can cancel.

2931
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:48,180
Okay.

2932
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:49,340
That was an accident.

2933
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:51,320
Wait, what?

2934
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:51,980
Where?

2935
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:53,600
Oh, there.

2936
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:55,560
There.

2937
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:59,000
Don't worry, I can go in too!

2938
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:00,540
Where am I?

2939
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:04,320
Whoa, that's where I am.

2940
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:09,360
I need your armor swap.

2941
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:12,460
Nice.

2942
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:15,640
Everything is going the way we planned it.

2943
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:16,180
Everything is going the way we planned it.

2944
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:17,080
Where's his teammate?

2945
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:17,940
Oh, there it is.

2946
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:21,360
No, Clifford, go!

2947
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:23,840
I knew I could always believe in Clifford.

2948
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:24,880
Oh, thank God.

2949
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:25,780
I need this Prowler.

2950
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:28,780
There you go.

2951
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:33,640
The greatest sign of trust is letting your bro hold you right now.

2952
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:40,180
So how many nuts did you hold?

2953
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:43,760
Is that true, bro?

2954
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,020
Does he speak for all the other bros?

2955
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:49,800
So like, you know like trust falls?

2956
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,100
You know how people have like trust falls?

2957
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,800
You guys have like trust nuts?

2958
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:55,240
Is that what it's called?

2959
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:56,620
Not true?

2960
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,000
Yeah, bro.

2961
02:04:58,140 --> 02:04:58,880
Bro, what?

2962
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:05,980
If you've never had your bro hold your nut, is he really your bro in the first place?

2963
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:10,060
I don't understand.

2964
02:05:10,060 --> 02:05:10,780
I don't understand, bro.

2965
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:14,900
Yeah, it's the trust bro.

2966
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:18,600
All I'm saying...

2967
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:27,200
All I'm saying, if he's your best friend, if he's your best bro, prove it with a trust nut.

2968
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:32,700
I know, it's trust nut with a trust.

2969
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:38,560
True homies have the perfect hands.

2970
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:43,420
Yeah, exactly.

2971
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:47,440
Like, you gotta know if he's a real bro.

2972
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,300
Let me hold the nuts, bro.

2973
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:56,140
Thank you for the super chat.

2974
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:56,540
Thank you.

2975
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:58,900
Yeah.

2976
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:02,720
Okay, so it's like, you know how like people have like best man?

2977
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,460
Is he really your best man if he has...

2978
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,260
If he has...

2979
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:10,020
If he has...

2980
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:10,040
If he has...

2981
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:11,440
I've trusted him...

2982
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,800
With the nuts.

2983
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:19,300
What the hell is a trust- It's when a bro like...

2984
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:22,980
It's when a bro holds it tenderly.

2985
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:27,000
It's when you trust them with everything you have.

2986
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:34,760
Trust them with the future kids You know, bro...

2987
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,560
Oh my god.

2988
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:38,460
I was like duck hunting for that guy.

2989
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:39,180
Oh my god.

2990
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:39,180
I was like duck hunting for that guy.

2991
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:44,860
I literally was like...

2992
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:46,720
That was fucked up.

2993
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:48,180
I almost fucked it up there.

2994
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:52,240
Bro, I can't shoot this guy.

2995
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:56,640
There you go.

2996
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,460
Holy shit.

2997
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:01,120
Yeah, trust them with the potential kids.

2998
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:02,480
Exactly.

2999
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:08,820
If you had to ask what it is, you never had a real bro then.

3000
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:15,180
I've seen bros hold the inner thighs, but...

3001
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,040
Then you never had a real bro.

3002
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:21,240
I'm sorry to say this.

3003
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:22,100
Man.

3004
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,100
I'm sorry to tell you this.

3005
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:26,340
You've never had a real bro.

3006
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:28,640
A real bro would not have to ask.

3007
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,680
Also, they wouldn't have to ask.

3008
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,340
Hey bro, wanna feel my blood?

3009
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,760
That's all I'm saying.

3010
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:49,340
Wait, last team?

3011
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:50,140
Oh my god.

3012
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:51,260
I knew it.

3013
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,780
I knew this duo was unstoppable.

3014
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,200
Bro, what is this comp?

3015
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,500
Wait, I hear them.

3016
02:07:58,860 --> 02:08:03,080
They're like inside the... They're inside the big shield.

3017
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,100
If that's your real definition of a real bro, I don't need it.

3018
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:08,640
Bro.

3019
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,120
You don't trust your bro.

3020
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:11,640
You don't trust them.

3021
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:15,540
How can you have a best man if you can't even trust him?

3022
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,260
If you can't even trust him, what's the future children?

3023
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:27,000
Wait, so girls holding each other... each girl's over each...

3024
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,480
No, because women don't trust each other.

3025
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:29,540
Hahahaha.

3026
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:31,800
Hahahaha.

3027
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:34,340
Hahahaha.

3028
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:35,940
I'll share.

3029
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:36,840
Alright.

3030
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:39,680
I'm gonna mark you five over here.

3031
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,320
Doki, stop.

3032
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:47,220
This is so true and real.

3033
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,020
Alright, we're going downstairs.

3034
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:55,740
Alright.

3035
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:58,700
Oh, wait, they're over there.

3036
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:01,140
What the f...

3037
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:03,320
That's a... That's a solo?

3038
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:06,030
Please.

3039
02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:09,970
Holy shit.

3040
02:09:11,610 --> 02:09:12,910
Oh my god, we just walk here.

3041
02:09:13,010 --> 02:09:13,930
That was the game.

3042
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,250
I knew.

3043
02:09:15,330 --> 02:09:15,990
I knew it.

3044
02:09:16,050 --> 02:09:16,970
I knew.

3045
02:09:18,530 --> 02:09:19,490
I knew.

3046
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:22,890
I knew this team was it.

3047
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:24,510
I fucking knew it.

3048
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:26,770
I knew I had this team.

3049
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:28,350
This team was it.

3050
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:29,050
Oh god, please.

3051
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:29,390
Okay.

3052
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:31,950
I knew it.

3053
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:35,650
Clifford the big red dog and Sonic the blue hedgehog.

3054
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:37,830
I knew it.

3055
02:09:37,910 --> 02:09:39,810
That was easy effortless shit.

3056
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:40,610
I know, right?

3057
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:42,510
I trust my bros.

3058
02:09:42,590 --> 02:09:43,450
I just...

3059
02:09:43,450 --> 02:09:47,410
I don't wanna win anymore.

3060
02:09:54,230 --> 02:09:55,750
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

3061
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:56,150
Thank you.

3062
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:56,710
Thank you.

3063
02:09:56,770 --> 02:09:58,590
You can't trust your nuts with me bro.

3064
02:09:58,630 --> 02:09:59,570
For your future bro.

3065
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:01,150
Thank you for the super chat.

3066
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:01,590
Thank you.

3067
02:10:01,650 --> 02:10:02,130
Thank you.

3068
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:04,690
I knew it.

3069
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:04,930
No!

3070
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:06,850
No!

3071
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:10,490
My fucking bros!

3072
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:13,930
Doki the big yellow bird.

3073
02:10:16,490 --> 02:10:17,370
There you go.

3074
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:18,710
I can't believe it.

3075
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:22,890
The most effortless game I had and all I did was contact.

3076
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:28,810
Truly the game of all time.

3077
02:10:30,510 --> 02:10:31,790
Bro, it's over.

3078
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:39,620
Okay.

3079
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:40,940
Oh wait, they won too!

3080
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,040
They all won.

3081
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:42,560
They also won!

3082
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,460
But their names are not as funny!

3083
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:48,460
Are they truly winners if their names aren't even funny?

3084
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:50,660
Is bro over?

3085
02:10:55,070 --> 02:10:55,750
Alright.

3086
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:56,910
We're here.

3087
02:10:56,990 --> 02:10:57,370
We're ready.

3088
02:10:59,790 --> 02:11:02,470
Can't keep getting away with this.

3089
02:11:07,830 --> 02:11:08,510
Alright.

3090
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:11,510
We're here.

3091
02:11:11,690 --> 02:11:12,390
We're here!

3092
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:13,150
We're here!

3093
02:11:13,570 --> 02:11:14,250
We're here!

3094
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:14,450
Yeah!

3095
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:26,020
Looking for a new bro the last one.

3096
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,800
I don't want a trust.

3097
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:32,340
Mr. Toot, thank you for the super chat.

3098
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:32,700
Thank you.

3099
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:33,140
Thank you.

3100
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:38,080
Guys, I'm pretty sure a dragoon here out there will do a trust... the trust nut with you.

3101
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:39,080
I'm pretty sure.

3102
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:42,800
Any dragoons that want to take his offer?

3103
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:47,220
Alright.

3104
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:47,800
Let's go.

3105
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:49,680
Cookies, stop!

3106
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:53,300
Oh shit!

3107
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:54,020
It's fine.

3108
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:54,940
Watch this.

3109
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,300
They won't expect it.

3110
02:11:58,200 --> 02:11:59,280
Oh, fuck!

3111
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:00,520
I didn't expect that!

3112
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:05,040
I definitely didn't expect it.

3113
02:12:10,830 --> 02:12:11,650
Wait, what?

3114
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:14,370
Oh, wait, never mind.

3115
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:15,990
I was gonna climb up and help him.

3116
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:17,150
Boom.

3117
02:12:18,270 --> 02:12:18,850
Alright.

3118
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,970
They did expect it.

3119
02:12:20,990 --> 02:12:21,070
Oh, shit.

3120
02:12:21,070 --> 02:12:22,430
Thank you for the super chat!

3121
02:12:22,530 --> 02:12:22,750
Thank you!

3122
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:23,070
Thank you!

3123
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:29,030
There's something surreal about hearing your Oshii talk about the trust net while following Sonic the blue hedgehog around!

3124
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:31,250
Thank you for the super chat!

3125
02:12:31,530 --> 02:12:31,850
Thank you!

3126
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:32,530
Thank you!

3127
02:12:33,210 --> 02:12:34,570
It's just... it's just...

3128
02:12:34,570 --> 02:12:38,150
It's just making sure, you know, you can trust your bro.

3129
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:41,750
It's okay, he's fine.

3130
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:44,230
He's so fine.

3131
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:46,310
Wait, is this guy... that guy is Pred.

3132
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:47,850
You fucking idiot.

3133
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:49,430
Wait, what Pred are you?

3134
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:51,190
Pred or Top what?

3135
02:12:52,190 --> 02:12:54,530
Oh my god, this guy threw garbage.

3136
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:03,130
Now that's a distrust nut.

3137
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:04,490
What I did there.

3138
02:13:05,890 --> 02:13:07,450
Alright, there's people over here.

3139
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:11,250
Alright.

3140
02:13:11,550 --> 02:13:13,510
Different kind of trust!

3141
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:19,630
Alright.

3142
02:13:23,310 --> 02:13:24,870
Where did he get shot from?

3143
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:25,710
Oh, yoink!

3144
02:13:25,810 --> 02:13:27,330
Oh, that's nothing to yoink from there.

3145
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:29,290
Oh wait, what the fuck?

3146
02:13:30,030 --> 02:13:30,850
I'm going in.

3147
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:31,770
JK.

3148
02:13:35,170 --> 02:13:36,030
Haha, JK.

3149
02:13:38,530 --> 02:13:39,350
They're all dead.

3150
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:43,170
I'm gonna steal this real fast.

3151
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:45,010
Oh, wait!

3152
02:13:46,150 --> 02:13:46,810
Watch this!

3153
02:13:48,210 --> 02:13:48,770
Oh!

3154
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:52,840
That was scary.

3155
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:57,560
Oh shit!

3156
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:58,460
More people are coming.

3157
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:01,840
There's people here.

3158
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:05,480
I have to go up the old-fashioned way.

3159
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:09,220
Give me a sec.

3160
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:11,420
Send highlights.

3161
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:12,700
I feel like that's cool.

3162
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:14,340
Wait, below me?

3163
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:17,420
What the fuck are they doing below me?

3164
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:19,580
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3165
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:20,840
What are they doing down there?

3166
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:23,100
Nice.

3167
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:24,680
See, we're winning!

3168
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,220
We're doing it!

3169
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:28,920
It's like a delivery!

3170
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:32,420
Oh, this is so cool!

3171
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:34,220
Wait, I actually like this ability a lot.

3172
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:35,740
Actually, no.

3173
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,280
Three and a 2x?

3174
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:38,740
Yeah, that's fine.

3175
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:44,240
Wait, who's shooting at?

3176
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:44,880
Wait, what?

3177
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:46,820
Oh, bro.

3178
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:48,400
Bro, this is not good, bro.

3179
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:48,540
Oh, no.

3180
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:49,980
Bro, this is not good.

3181
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:53,840
Never mind.

3182
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:54,680
It's all good now.

3183
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:00,060
Never mind, bro.

3184
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:00,560
It's all good.

3185
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:04,240
It's fine.

3186
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:04,660
Watch this.

3187
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:08,020
Where does this go?

3188
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:15,110
Guys, I found out where it went.

3189
02:15:20,330 --> 02:15:21,130
Hey, guys.

3190
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:23,250
I figured out where it went.

3191
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:26,450
It was not a place I wanted to go, though.

3192
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:33,340
Oh, no.

3193
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:34,460
Bro, bro, bro, no!

3194
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:36,360
Bro, no!

3195
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:38,180
Oh, fuck.

3196
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:38,520
Okay.

3197
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:42,060
Where is he?

3198
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:47,880
I'm looking.

3199
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:48,340
I'm looking.

3200
02:15:48,380 --> 02:15:48,660
I'm looking.

3201
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:49,580
What?

3202
02:15:53,210 --> 02:15:54,150
Trying to cover you?

3203
02:15:55,670 --> 02:15:57,330
I'm trying to cover you right now, bro?

3204
02:15:58,390 --> 02:15:59,230
Don't worry, bro.

3205
02:16:01,950 --> 02:16:02,810
Don't worry, bro.

3206
02:16:02,830 --> 02:16:03,430
I got you, bro.

3207
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:05,450
I told you I got you, bro.

3208
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:08,730
It's trust nut time.

3209
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:11,770
Oh, I'm E.

3210
02:16:15,490 --> 02:16:16,010
Watch this.

3211
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:19,770
Where?

3212
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:23,930
Oh, shit!

3213
02:16:24,010 --> 02:16:25,070
Where am I?

3214
02:16:27,830 --> 02:16:29,350
Where am I going?

3215
02:16:30,390 --> 02:16:31,550
Bro, stop!

3216
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:37,390
I trust it too hard.

3217
02:16:41,390 --> 02:16:42,030
Witnessed.

3218
02:16:43,790 --> 02:16:44,590
All right.

3219
02:16:44,910 --> 02:16:45,550
See?

3220
02:16:45,710 --> 02:16:46,610
We are winning now.

3221
02:16:48,470 --> 02:16:49,630
Harry, stop it.

3222
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:51,790
You get lost.

3223
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:55,010
I just... there's a lot of things going on!

3224
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:58,050
You get lost too!

3225
02:16:58,210 --> 02:17:00,130
You have to go through what I went through!

3226
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:03,550
There's so many things around me!

3227
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:08,750
Guys, it's not a me issue.

3228
02:17:08,990 --> 02:17:10,330
It's an everybody issue.

3229
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:12,450
You just don't understand.

3230
02:17:13,070 --> 02:17:15,290
You just didn't live through what I lived through.

3231
02:17:17,230 --> 02:17:18,950
I broke the net.

3232
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:21,850
Thank you for the super chat, Dikowsing.

3233
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:22,730
Thank you, thank you.

3234
02:17:22,850 --> 02:17:25,190
I literally clutched this for my team.

3235
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:26,950
I clutched this.

3236
02:17:27,150 --> 02:17:27,910
You don't understand.

3237
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:29,390
Wait, what?

3238
02:17:29,510 --> 02:17:30,550
Where are they shooting at?

3239
02:17:31,210 --> 02:17:32,090
Where do we go?

3240
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:37,030
That's my first day, exactly.

3241
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:39,890
This hero literally... this legend literally just got released, guys.

3242
02:17:40,070 --> 02:17:40,750
What do you want from me?

3243
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:45,010
I'm learning it live!

3244
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:46,070
I'm learning it live with all of you.

3245
02:17:48,330 --> 02:17:49,050
Let's see.

3246
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:50,350
I mean, we could just...

3247
02:17:50,350 --> 02:17:54,230
Can we not put this out here?

3248
02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:55,570
We cannot?

3249
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:56,770
That's bullshit.

3250
02:17:57,830 --> 02:17:58,690
Wait, we can.

3251
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:00,350
That's actually bullshit.

3252
02:18:00,830 --> 02:18:02,010
I'm gonna put this here.

3253
02:18:02,330 --> 02:18:03,970
And then take this.

3254
02:18:05,690 --> 02:18:06,530
I leave.

3255
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:07,930
I leave!

3256
02:18:08,370 --> 02:18:10,810
I leave.

3257
02:18:11,390 --> 02:18:12,270
I leave now.

3258
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:17,500
What?

3259
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:24,920
Bro, we crossed paths!

3260
02:18:25,380 --> 02:18:27,500
We crossed streams!

3261
02:18:28,180 --> 02:18:29,400
What the fuck?

3262
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:31,720
What the fuck was that?

3263
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:34,780
We actually crossed streams.

3264
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:41,660
Bro!

3265
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:45,820
Bro, you like, fucked them up.

3266
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:47,280
What happened?

3267
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:49,160
Almost touched streams.

3268
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:51,780
Bro!

3269
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:54,520
That was like... out of nowhere.

3270
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:57,320
I was like, who the fuck is that?

3271
02:18:58,860 --> 02:18:59,440
Alright.

3272
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:00,640
Mine's a little red.

3273
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:02,380
I think I might need to see a doctor.

3274
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:07,200
Alright, mine's nexus no longer.

3275
02:19:07,580 --> 02:19:08,160
Alright.

3276
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:09,300
That happened.

3277
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,840
This is why you don't cross streams.

3278
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:17,900
Oh, shit.

3279
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:30,200
Well.

3280
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:32,380
He's over there.

3281
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:35,900
Whoa!

3282
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:37,320
Yeah, I'm fucking going back.

3283
02:19:37,540 --> 02:19:37,960
Goodbye.

3284
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,780
Yeah, that's a little bit too much.

3285
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:42,580
Wow!

3286
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:44,400
To put in your whole army!

3287
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:48,040
Alright, there we go.

3288
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:53,920
The entire army fucking came over to me.

3289
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:55,200
Call in!

3290
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:57,680
What the fuck?

3291
02:19:58,300 --> 02:19:59,720
Yeah, what's going on?

3292
02:20:05,290 --> 02:20:06,510
What the hell?

3293
02:20:07,410 --> 02:20:08,530
Is he behind?

3294
02:20:11,090 --> 02:20:13,450
Okay, that was very...

3295
02:20:13,450 --> 02:20:19,610
That was very ballsy of them.

3296
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:22,090
Alright, nice.

3297
02:20:23,370 --> 02:20:28,230
That was actually so confident that... Holy shit.

3298
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:32,450
I still have one more charge?

3299
02:20:32,590 --> 02:20:32,890
I do.

3300
02:20:33,130 --> 02:20:34,210
Wait, no, I don't.

3301
02:20:35,390 --> 02:20:36,430
Okay, let's see.

3302
02:20:36,590 --> 02:20:37,550
I'm gonna grab that.

3303
02:20:38,350 --> 02:20:38,830
Yeah!

3304
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:40,350
Very ambitious.

3305
02:20:40,530 --> 02:20:40,850
Yeah.

3306
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:42,230
Very fucking ambitious.

3307
02:20:43,410 --> 02:20:44,450
Those free kills.

3308
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:47,750
Let's see.

3309
02:20:47,870 --> 02:20:54,370
If I had nickel every time Doki said, watch this, and I immediately jump scared, I could possibly play for the super chat.

3310
02:20:55,130 --> 02:20:56,650
Thank you for the super chat.

3311
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:56,950
Thank you.

3312
02:20:57,050 --> 02:20:57,530
Thank you.

3313
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:03,320
Alright.

3314
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:04,440
Where's another team?

3315
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:06,660
We gotta go this way, guys.

3316
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:09,840
Guys, I just realized he's live!

3317
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:10,920
Oh my god!

3318
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:12,860
I feel these finesse.

3319
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:14,600
Let's go.

3320
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:16,880
Where do we go?

3321
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:18,140
Oh, this is new.

3322
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:19,920
I've went through this before?

3323
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:24,920
To be fair, this map has been like blurring together for me.

3324
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:30,300
Alright, let's see.

3325
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:33,100
Down, not go!

3326
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,080
Down, not go!

3327
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:37,340
Wait, I can just drop down.

3328
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:40,260
Oh, it's like... this is like the storm point thing.

3329
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:43,020
It's a trust fall again.

3330
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:46,120
Okay, watch.

3331
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:50,160
Nobody.

3332
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:51,860
Okay, thank god.

3333
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:53,060
Hahaha!

3334
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:53,580
Hahaha!

3335
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:53,800
Hahaha!

3336
02:21:56,560 --> 02:22:00,300
Every time I go through those portals, I just hope there's nobody there.

3337
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:01,220
Hahaha!

3338
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:04,640
There's people here though.

3339
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:07,940
On me.

3340
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:10,120
What a nasty villain over here.

3341
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:14,580
He's up here too.

3342
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:17,780
Oh!

3343
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:21,960
Oh!

3344
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:22,060
Oh!

3345
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:29,350
That was not supposed to happen, but I take those!

3346
02:22:30,950 --> 02:22:31,450
Wait, what?

3347
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:34,490
Where are they?

3348
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:37,950
Where are they?

3349
02:22:39,310 --> 02:22:40,350
I hear them.

3350
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:43,730
Hey.

3351
02:22:46,330 --> 02:22:47,350
Back I go.

3352
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:52,430
Yeah, they were up top.

3353
02:22:53,550 --> 02:22:54,870
No one there heard them.

3354
02:22:57,310 --> 02:22:58,550
Is he still up there?

3355
02:22:58,810 --> 02:22:59,750
There's no way.

3356
02:23:03,050 --> 02:23:03,990
Wait, what the fuck?

3357
02:23:04,010 --> 02:23:04,790
There's a crypto here.

3358
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:08,210
Don't worry.

3359
02:23:09,070 --> 02:23:10,750
Surely he's not down here again.

3360
02:23:11,030 --> 02:23:11,950
Oh, he isn't.

3361
02:23:12,370 --> 02:23:13,330
No way, bro!

3362
02:23:14,330 --> 02:23:15,050
Got you!

3363
02:23:16,910 --> 02:23:18,450
Bro, I got you, bro!

3364
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:21,070
Okay.

3365
02:23:21,850 --> 02:23:22,250
Nice.

3366
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:23,910
Told you I got this, man.

3367
02:23:26,930 --> 02:23:28,050
Alright, I'll go this way.

3368
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:28,530
Okay.

3369
02:23:29,150 --> 02:23:29,890
Let's see.

3370
02:23:30,570 --> 02:23:32,930
The last three squads are shooting at each other, I think.

3371
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:34,570
Yeah, they are.

3372
02:23:39,690 --> 02:23:42,190
There's no way I could get fucked over here.

3373
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:46,500
There you go.

3374
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:47,500
There's no way.

3375
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:50,580
There's no way they're just gonna shoot back at me.

3376
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:52,400
They're too stupid for that.

3377
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:55,520
The other team is like...

3378
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:58,040
They were looking at another team on my right side.

3379
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:00,640
Woo!

3380
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:05,400
Okay, I just realized I don't have a lot of ammo.

3381
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:06,840
But it's okay.

3382
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:09,580
It's okay.

3383
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:10,760
Everything will be fine.

3384
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:13,300
Surely it'll be okay, right?

3385
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:18,040
Yeah, surely it'll be okay.

3386
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:20,900
Me and my... Oh, wait!

3387
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:21,580
I knew it.

3388
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:23,840
I knew things would be okay.

3389
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:23,940
I knew things would be okay.

3390
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:28,420
Everything always looks up for me.

3391
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:29,740
I knew it.

3392
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:31,560
Wait, they have to drop down, right?

3393
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:32,500
No, they don't.

3394
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:34,760
Wait, can I like...

3395
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:36,720
Go up from here?

3396
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:40,600
Like, how fucked would I be?

3397
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:46,100
Don't go up!

3398
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:48,360
Woah!

3399
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:01,680
Yeah, I'm not doing that again.

3400
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:08,520
Who would've thought it'd be pretty bad?

3401
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:14,260
Who would've thought it'd be pretty fucking bad?

3402
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:18,480
Oh my god!

3403
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:19,620
They... Wait, they have red armor!

3404
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:20,440
Wait a minute.

3405
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:22,000
How long have they been here?

3406
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:23,920
Guys, stop.

3407
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:25,080
Guys, I'm gonna come with you.

3408
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:27,800
Do it again.

3409
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:28,720
It'll be so funny.

3410
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:30,200
Okay, but like, what if I do this?

3411
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:30,700
Watch this.

3412
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:32,060
Watch this.

3413
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:33,960
What if I...

3414
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:38,720
Okay, death 30.

3415
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:39,540
30.

3416
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:40,140
Oh no.

3417
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:40,880
What if I...

3418
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:44,060
Guys, it would be so funny though.

3419
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:48,400
What...

3420
02:25:52,020 --> 02:25:54,540
Okay, let me actually contribute to this fight.

3421
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:04,840
Okay, let me actually contribute.

3422
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:15,740
We actually have to be part of this game now.

3423
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:18,300
I think it's like one guy, not gonna lie.

3424
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:19,080
I'm pretty sure.

3425
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:20,760
But he just walked behind.

3426
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:23,060
There's no way.

3427
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:28,080
He literally just walked in the back.

3428
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:35,220
But where is this other team?

3429
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:37,580
Oh shit.

3430
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:38,680
Come back.

3431
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:39,160
Look, look, look.

3432
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:39,500
I'm helping.

3433
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:39,900
I'm helping.

3434
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:41,000
I'm covering.

3435
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:45,660
I'm covering.

3436
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:50,700
Jesus Christ.

3437
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:51,760
Guys, che!

3438
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,100
Fucking che!

3439
02:26:58,780 --> 02:26:59,600
Wait, what?

3440
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:05,080
I heard people.

3441
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:06,260
Right behind us.

3442
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:07,480
Oh god.

3443
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:09,120
Give me a shot at it while I do this.

3444
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:10,920
They're like right here.

3445
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,340
What is he trying to do?

3446
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:18,260
Waste our ammo?

3447
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,880
Like, what is he trying to do?

3448
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:27,980
Oh my god.

3449
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,180
These guys are so annoying though.

3450
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:30,400
They are so fucking annoying.

3451
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:33,600
So annoying.

3452
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,260
Holy shit.

3453
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:39,320
Guys, fucking che!

3454
02:27:41,340 --> 02:27:42,840
Don't have a lot of shields.

3455
02:27:43,060 --> 02:27:44,800
Okay, I have zero shield cells left.

3456
02:27:45,140 --> 02:27:45,700
Okay.

3457
02:27:50,850 --> 02:27:52,690
Bro, how do you still have ammo?

3458
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:57,920
Oh my god.

3459
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,140
Bro, fuck off.

3460
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:01,700
What the fucking...

3461
02:28:02,460 --> 02:28:05,900
The fucking jiggle peek from the crypto.

3462
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:07,240
Are you serious?

3463
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,860
The crypto has a goddamn jiggle peek.

3464
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:13,020
That's actually so funny.

3465
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:15,940
Fuck it, we'll put it here.

3466
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:19,780
Alright, here we go.

3467
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:23,600
There.

3468
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:25,180
What a waste of a crypto.

3469
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:29,400
Wait, what?

3470
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:31,840
Okay, I'm gonna cover the left side just in case.

3471
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:33,080
What was that?

3472
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:40,060
Are you serious?

3473
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:44,520
What a fucking move.

3474
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:49,250
I'm gonna ult.

3475
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:50,890
I'm gonna do this just in case.

3476
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:54,430
Wait, are they dead?

3477
02:28:54,670 --> 02:28:55,430
Where are they?

3478
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:58,630
Who ulted?

3479
02:29:00,330 --> 02:29:02,010
Wait, this is a rock.

3480
02:29:03,610 --> 02:29:09,890
HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA Okay.

3481
02:29:10,930 --> 02:29:12,550
You know, effort, effort.

3482
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:15,630
I was gonna say, why would you ult that?

3483
02:29:18,770 --> 02:29:19,810
Oh no, he's down.

3484
02:29:19,950 --> 02:29:20,410
Where is he?

3485
02:29:22,430 --> 02:29:23,270
I fucked up.

3486
02:29:24,410 --> 02:29:24,890
Where?

3487
02:29:27,930 --> 02:29:28,870
Okay, I see him.

3488
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:35,520
No!

3489
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:36,560
This is... No!

3490
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:37,540
Don't itembrace!

3491
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:38,240
Please!

3492
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:41,870
He's my teammate!

3493
02:29:42,190 --> 02:29:42,510
Bro!

3494
02:29:42,770 --> 02:29:43,950
He's so low!

3495
02:29:43,950 --> 02:29:46,570
He was actually so low, man!

3496
02:29:46,950 --> 02:29:47,410
Bro!

3497
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:48,230
It's one guy!

3498
02:29:48,390 --> 02:29:49,450
One guy.

3499
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:53,290
I don't let... don't let him rez.

3500
02:29:56,270 --> 02:29:57,590
Literally one guy.

3501
02:29:57,970 --> 02:29:58,570
Literally.

3502
02:29:58,810 --> 02:30:00,530
It's literally one guy!

3503
02:30:00,710 --> 02:30:02,030
We did so much!

3504
02:30:02,330 --> 02:30:02,550
Yes!

3505
02:30:04,210 --> 02:30:05,930
They left me alone.

3506
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:09,290
Got the other.

3507
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:10,110
Okay.

3508
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:11,530
Alright, there we go.

3509
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:12,150
We did it.

3510
02:30:12,330 --> 02:30:12,830
We won.

3511
02:30:13,630 --> 02:30:15,050
Oh my god.

3512
02:30:15,130 --> 02:30:16,610
We fucking won.

3513
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:18,510
Bro!

3514
02:30:18,730 --> 02:30:20,670
He almost got one guy!

3515
02:30:21,190 --> 02:30:22,310
He got me.

3516
02:30:25,890 --> 02:30:27,150
Oh my god.

3517
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:27,810
We did it.

3518
02:30:27,930 --> 02:30:29,430
I did the most I can do.

3519
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:29,910
See?

3520
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:31,310
Middle of the pack.

3521
02:30:31,990 --> 02:30:32,630
Consistently.

3522
02:30:33,310 --> 02:30:34,670
Consistently averaged.

3523
02:30:36,810 --> 02:30:39,890
Look, we are consistently averaged.

3524
02:30:41,590 --> 02:30:43,190
Stop being scared.

3525
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:44,770
Back to back.

3526
02:30:46,550 --> 02:30:49,430
Back to fucking back, guys.

3527
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:52,790
She's so mid.

3528
02:30:57,510 --> 02:30:59,250
14 kills got... Bro!

3529
02:30:59,390 --> 02:31:02,190
That guy stole... is a kill stealer!

3530
02:31:02,390 --> 02:31:04,330
14 kills with 2.5k?

3531
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:07,710
I had 4 kills with 2k!

3532
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:09,370
That man is a kill stealer.

3533
02:31:12,650 --> 02:31:15,850
Bro, I don't wanna play... I don't wanna play fucking...

3534
02:31:15,850 --> 02:31:17,890
I don't wanna play ulti!

3535
02:31:18,310 --> 02:31:20,710
No one mid like Doki.

3536
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:24,810
Bro, fuck this team.

3537
02:31:24,850 --> 02:31:26,350
I'm gonna leave this... Nah, you know what?

3538
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:27,390
I'll let this team die.

3539
02:31:28,510 --> 02:31:29,770
I'll let this team die.

3540
02:31:31,310 --> 02:31:32,270
My suffering!

3541
02:31:32,490 --> 02:31:33,270
Oh my god!

3542
02:31:33,610 --> 02:31:35,270
This guy's not having a good time.

3543
02:31:37,630 --> 02:31:39,410
Alright, we're gonna go full in.

3544
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:40,090
I'm glad this is death.

3545
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:42,610
Everybody will die here.

3546
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:44,250
Shake my head.

3547
02:31:44,470 --> 02:31:45,990
My... oh, she is mid.

3548
02:31:46,670 --> 02:31:48,390
Alright... you stole alter.

3549
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:49,810
I'm glad this to death.

3550
02:31:50,590 --> 02:31:52,290
We're all gonna die here.

3551
02:31:52,590 --> 02:31:54,910
Bro needs to block off.

3552
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:57,130
We're getting all wins today.

3553
02:31:57,430 --> 02:31:57,990
Guys.

3554
02:31:59,410 --> 02:32:00,970
I wouldn't trust that.

3555
02:32:01,710 --> 02:32:04,830
Alright, here we go.

3556
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:06,670
We're getting a lot of wins, which is nice.

3557
02:32:07,430 --> 02:32:08,770
Can you guys just sell me the key?

3558
02:32:08,770 --> 02:32:09,510
Thank you!

3559
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:10,570
Thank you!

3560
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:13,070
Thank you!

3561
02:32:13,070 --> 02:32:13,590
Thank you!

3562
02:32:13,650 --> 02:32:14,030
Thank you everybody!

3563
02:32:14,570 --> 02:32:15,650
I really appreciate it.

3564
02:32:16,330 --> 02:32:17,330
Thank you guys.

3565
02:32:17,650 --> 02:32:18,310
Oh, see?

3566
02:32:18,430 --> 02:32:19,130
There he goes.

3567
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:23,690
Surely they'll be fine, right?

3568
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:25,890
I should like... Wow!

3569
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:27,570
Hey guys.

3570
02:32:28,610 --> 02:32:30,510
Oh, one guy left already.

3571
02:32:30,970 --> 02:32:31,910
That's what you get.

3572
02:32:31,970 --> 02:32:32,710
Oh, they both left.

3573
02:32:32,990 --> 02:32:33,290
Alright.

3574
02:32:33,650 --> 02:32:35,150
Finally I can leave as well.

3575
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,430
This is a different game.

3576
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:42,670
Nice.

3577
02:32:42,910 --> 02:32:45,650
Oh my god, I can feel the fucking R&D I'm getting there.

3578
02:32:47,530 --> 02:32:48,310
What's he gonna do?

3579
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:49,110
Peek me right here?

3580
02:32:59,890 --> 02:33:00,770
Okay, yeah.

3581
02:33:00,990 --> 02:33:02,330
That's what he did.

3582
02:33:08,770 --> 02:33:12,030
How was I supposed to know that he knew I was there?

3583
02:33:13,510 --> 02:33:16,930
Now my pro and dozer not trust already.

3584
02:33:17,470 --> 02:33:18,710
How is that?

3585
02:33:18,730 --> 02:33:19,530
Oh, and they're running?

3586
02:33:19,570 --> 02:33:20,530
These cowards.

3587
02:33:21,010 --> 02:33:23,510
I wish they... These fucking cowards.

3588
02:33:25,570 --> 02:33:27,450
Not even two seconds.

3589
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:29,550
Do you think he saw me guys?

3590
02:33:30,110 --> 02:33:31,770
I can't believe it.

3591
02:33:31,850 --> 02:33:33,010
They're fucking running?

3592
02:33:33,230 --> 02:33:34,330
In a pub?

3593
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:36,130
What are you?

3594
02:33:40,330 --> 02:33:41,070
Can't believe it.

3595
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:45,920
If I don't get ulti, I leave.

3596
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:46,440
Oh.

3597
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:47,400
I stay.

3598
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:56,160
Yay!

3599
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:56,760
Nice.

3600
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:58,260
Yes, I stay.

3601
02:33:59,340 --> 02:33:59,940
Nice.

3602
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:06,520
I'm glad Doki is keeping to the script today.

3603
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:12,300
Ulti or leave.

3604
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:13,080
Exactly.

3605
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:14,720
Ulti or leave!

3606
02:34:19,770 --> 02:34:21,410
Rad, welcome to the tomato farm!

3607
02:34:21,490 --> 02:34:23,030
I really love this banner.

3608
02:34:23,130 --> 02:34:23,630
It's so cute.

3609
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:26,250
Thank you for the... Welcome to the tomato farm.

3610
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:26,750
Welcome, welcome.

3611
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:32,370
No.

3612
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:32,890
No.

3613
02:34:33,570 --> 02:34:35,070
I don't wanna be jump master.

3614
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:36,270
No.

3615
02:34:37,290 --> 02:34:37,810
No.

3616
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:40,670
Alright.

3617
02:34:40,670 --> 02:34:41,650
Ulti or troll.

3618
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:42,070
Exactly.

3619
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:45,530
Not nicely possessive.

3620
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:46,170
Wait a minute!

3621
02:34:46,290 --> 02:34:47,730
She speaks Cantonese!

3622
02:34:47,930 --> 02:34:49,650
I speak Cantonese!

3623
02:34:49,770 --> 02:34:50,970
We are...

3624
02:34:52,030 --> 02:34:53,570
Good bros.

3625
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:57,010
Top 10 quotes before disaster.

3626
02:34:58,910 --> 02:35:00,610
It's basically me!

3627
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:04,430
Wait, what?

3628
02:35:06,150 --> 02:35:07,590
Oh shit!

3629
02:35:07,870 --> 02:35:09,490
Yeah, those are definitely enemies.

3630
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:10,730
Oh!

3631
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:15,420
Okay.

3632
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:17,960
I did not expect them to...

3633
02:35:17,960 --> 02:35:18,060
Oh!

3634
02:35:18,300 --> 02:35:19,700
They locked her in!

3635
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:23,680
That's so fucked up!

3636
02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:25,780
Holy shit!

3637
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:27,300
Oh no!

3638
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,800
That's so fucked up!

3639
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:36,170
Oh my god!

3640
02:35:36,330 --> 02:35:39,070
I got shot by three different people.

3641
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:39,830
Look at that!

3642
02:35:40,130 --> 02:35:42,590
They have to be squatted up.

3643
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:44,670
Bro, there's no way.

3644
02:35:44,670 --> 02:35:49,610
There's no way that team is like not in a voice call right now.

3645
02:35:49,610 --> 02:35:51,330
That was so coordinated.

3646
02:35:51,510 --> 02:35:52,250
Okay!

3647
02:35:52,630 --> 02:35:57,270
But guys, that shit was incredibly coordinated.

3648
02:35:57,410 --> 02:36:01,650
That was actually crazy how coordinated they were.

3649
02:36:01,850 --> 02:36:06,750
Literally snared... fucking snared and locked us in.

3650
02:36:07,170 --> 02:36:10,070
And they said, get that bitch.

3651
02:36:10,430 --> 02:36:12,530
That was so fucking crazy.

3652
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:16,530
That was like... and they literally... I'm pretty sure they did a countdown too.

3653
02:36:16,730 --> 02:36:18,350
It was 3, 2, 1.

3654
02:36:19,890 --> 02:36:20,390
Yeah!

3655
02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:24,210
No alter.

3656
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:25,370
I leave.

3657
02:36:27,730 --> 02:36:29,210
Let me leave.

3658
02:36:29,650 --> 02:36:30,190
It's okay.

3659
02:36:30,330 --> 02:36:31,030
We'll let random.

3660
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:34,010
They're giving you a... tell your trust nuts now.

3661
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:38,530
Like, we wish your teammates are like this.

3662
02:36:39,310 --> 02:36:40,730
They prep this for a week.

3663
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:42,130
Dude, I feel like they had a plan.

3664
02:36:42,770 --> 02:36:43,730
I leave.

3665
02:36:44,430 --> 02:36:45,530
That's fucking right.

3666
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:47,990
I leave.

3667
02:36:52,890 --> 02:36:55,790
Did they say something like, wait, this is a streamer?

3668
02:36:55,890 --> 02:36:56,670
And I left.

3669
02:36:58,310 --> 02:37:00,170
It's like a Wild West sighting.

3670
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:01,450
Yeah.

3671
02:37:01,990 --> 02:37:02,470
Yeah.

3672
02:37:02,590 --> 02:37:03,270
It's like a...

3673
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:05,670
It's like a Wild West sighting there.

3674
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:06,990
Like, you see a Doki Bird.

3675
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:09,110
Like, it's like bird watching.

3676
02:37:09,290 --> 02:37:12,010
You see Doki Bird for one second and then she's gone.

3677
02:37:12,010 --> 02:37:13,350
It was a legend.

3678
02:37:16,930 --> 02:37:21,410
The one second of Doki Bird before she disappears forever.

3679
02:37:24,330 --> 02:37:26,770
Oh my god, we're gonna third wheel this date!

3680
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:31,030
We're gonna third wheel this date!

3681
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:34,850
Little bird watching.

3682
02:37:35,010 --> 02:37:35,970
Bird seeing.

3683
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:41,430
Oh shit, there's the... there's the roller player.

3684
02:37:43,910 --> 02:37:45,410
Oh, there's the roller player.

3685
02:37:45,410 --> 02:37:45,430
There's the roller player.

3686
02:37:45,430 --> 02:37:45,870
Oh my god.

3687
02:37:45,970 --> 02:37:46,490
Oh god.

3688
02:37:46,490 --> 02:37:46,790
It's okay.

3689
02:37:47,290 --> 02:37:47,550
Blimey.

3690
02:37:49,830 --> 02:37:52,150
Ask him about the Dresden.

3691
02:37:52,370 --> 02:37:54,610
They should have taken a picture before it.

3692
02:37:54,610 --> 02:37:55,090
It's okay.

3693
02:37:55,170 --> 02:37:57,210
I'm logged in into their bird watching book.

3694
02:37:57,810 --> 02:37:58,890
I'm in the log.

3695
02:38:00,190 --> 02:38:01,710
I'm the third wheel.

3696
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:03,970
Take us here.

3697
02:38:04,230 --> 02:38:04,710
Okay.

3698
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:07,350
It'll be a great date.

3699
02:38:07,690 --> 02:38:09,250
It's a life and death date.

3700
02:38:10,470 --> 02:38:11,410
Oh my god!

3701
02:38:11,510 --> 02:38:12,310
She took us there!

3702
02:38:12,990 --> 02:38:16,690
I mean, it ain't a real date until somebody might die.

3703
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:18,810
I feel terrible.

3704
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:21,990
At least they got rid of Promenade.

3705
02:38:24,950 --> 02:38:26,130
Alright, let's see.

3706
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:31,010
We're gonna loot in the best kind of dates, exactly.

3707
02:38:32,530 --> 02:38:34,030
Is it really a date?

3708
02:38:34,050 --> 02:38:37,530
Unless the threat of death is looming over your heads.

3709
02:38:39,250 --> 02:38:40,230
Alright, let's see.

3710
02:38:40,330 --> 02:38:41,670
I got a Nemesis and a Wingman.

3711
02:38:41,770 --> 02:38:44,910
That's too long range at the same time.

3712
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:49,050
Don't worry, I got you!

3713
02:38:52,530 --> 02:38:54,250
I got through the rock.

3714
02:38:55,810 --> 02:38:57,270
Don't worry, I got you, man!

3715
02:38:58,170 --> 02:38:59,350
I got you, bro!

3716
02:39:03,710 --> 02:39:04,810
I got one of them.

3717
02:39:10,130 --> 02:39:12,070
Of course, I'm getting chased.

3718
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:13,830
No, you're not!

3719
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:16,210
You literally ran into a diff- Oh shit!

3720
02:39:18,450 --> 02:39:21,210
All I'm saying is he did not get chased.

3721
02:39:22,350 --> 02:39:24,390
He definitely did not get chased.

3722
02:39:24,910 --> 02:39:27,610
I literally blocked him from getting the data set.

3723
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:28,670
They're both dead.

3724
02:39:28,870 --> 02:39:30,010
I was looming all this team here.

3725
02:39:30,330 --> 02:39:34,670
I was running away and the first thing they do is like, oh, let me go face that.

3726
02:39:35,430 --> 02:39:38,690
I was just like, what do you mean you're getting chased?

3727
02:39:38,690 --> 02:39:41,190
I literally got two of them away from you.

3728
02:39:45,230 --> 02:39:46,970
Bro, that sucks, man.

3729
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:52,070
Guys, is it... we're like... it's like... we're like the eavesdroppers too.

3730
02:39:52,330 --> 02:39:54,310
Like, we're that... we're the eye in the wall.

3731
02:39:55,470 --> 02:39:57,590
But not like the voyeuristic way.

3732
02:39:57,810 --> 02:39:59,810
Like, not the creepy voyeuristic way.

3733
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:02,450
Because they know I'm here.

3734
02:40:02,610 --> 02:40:04,370
So they consented, I think.

3735
02:40:04,710 --> 02:40:05,270
I...

3736
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:11,390
Again?!

3737
02:40:11,390 --> 02:40:13,650
Okay, I don't wanna...

3738
02:40:17,610 --> 02:40:21,890
Okay, I am... I don't wanna do it twice.

3739
02:40:23,190 --> 02:40:25,010
That sounds worse.

3740
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:28,830
They know I'm here.

3741
02:40:29,090 --> 02:40:31,950
So it's not my fault if we're listening in.

3742
02:40:32,930 --> 02:40:33,590
You're...

3743
02:40:37,550 --> 02:40:38,610
4k people.

3744
02:40:38,690 --> 02:40:40,210
4k people watching Bro's Day.

3745
02:40:40,530 --> 02:40:41,910
Look, we're judging them.

3746
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:46,950
Guys, I just don't wanna hear... don't wanna be in an awkward... awkward third wheel again.

3747
02:40:47,330 --> 02:40:52,450
Like, twi... okay, if there was like a little like... uh... intermission between it, that's fine.

3748
02:40:52,650 --> 02:40:53,330
But there wasn't.

3749
02:40:53,410 --> 02:40:55,250
I had to like listen in twice in a row.

3750
02:40:55,710 --> 02:40:56,190
Like...

3751
02:40:57,970 --> 02:41:01,350
Look, I wanna listen in on other people's stuff.

3752
02:41:02,310 --> 02:41:02,790
Awkward.

3753
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:05,430
Okay, Mr. Rat.

3754
02:41:06,350 --> 02:41:07,630
Oh, no, no, no.

3755
02:41:07,630 --> 02:41:08,350
Please.

3756
02:41:08,530 --> 02:41:09,590
Please, I'm streaming.

3757
02:41:12,270 --> 02:41:15,110
I'll give you... $5.

3758
02:41:15,390 --> 02:41:16,910
No, I can't type fast enough!

3759
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:22,690
I can't... I can't type fast enough!

3760
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:27,750
No!

3761
02:41:28,750 --> 02:41:30,410
Let me play Ulti!

3762
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:32,990
What if I leave this one too?

3763
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:37,130
I just wanna leave... wanna play Ulti.

3764
02:41:37,630 --> 02:41:38,310
Let's go.

3765
02:41:38,410 --> 02:41:38,730
We need...

3766
02:41:43,170 --> 02:41:44,210
I'm sorry.

3767
02:41:44,210 --> 02:41:45,390
We need the other player...

3768
02:41:45,390 --> 02:41:46,250
Oh.

3769
02:41:46,250 --> 02:41:55,110
Okay, Ryan needs you so much.

3770
02:41:55,370 --> 02:41:55,550
Hello?

3771
02:41:58,270 --> 02:41:59,350
Oh, Vietnam, here we go.

3772
02:41:59,690 --> 02:42:01,330
Okay, this is the firstOH.

3773
02:42:04,910 --> 02:42:05,430
Hey.

3774
02:42:05,650 --> 02:42:05,810
I guess it bless you.

3775
02:42:07,010 --> 02:42:07,530
Loot.

3776
02:42:07,530 --> 02:42:07,610
Young!

3777
02:42:07,610 --> 02:42:07,790
Alright.

3778
02:42:08,550 --> 02:42:09,810
Death number two.

3779
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:13,510
No ulti, then death.

3780
02:42:14,030 --> 02:42:15,030
We must go.

3781
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:17,410
We got a lot of wins though today.

3782
02:42:24,330 --> 02:42:26,550
Just in case I need- Oh nice, they ran away.

3783
02:42:27,890 --> 02:42:28,870
That's even better.

3784
02:42:32,290 --> 02:42:32,730
Woo!

3785
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:34,250
But it's such a waste though.

3786
02:42:34,790 --> 02:42:35,390
Wait, what?

3787
02:42:35,470 --> 02:42:36,190
You didn't run away?

3788
02:42:37,050 --> 02:42:37,490
Really?

3789
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:38,750
You should have ran away, bitch.

3790
02:42:40,630 --> 02:42:43,850
Well, maybe I- Oh, you should have ran away, little boy.

3791
02:42:47,290 --> 02:42:49,430
That was the wrong thing you did.

3792
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:53,800
Nice.

3793
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:55,320
Yeah!

3794
02:42:56,680 --> 02:42:57,740
I leveled up!

3795
02:42:59,420 --> 02:43:02,140
Okay, I'm gonna heal real fast though.

3796
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:06,500
Right in my mouth you go.

3797
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:08,400
Gonna eat you up.

3798
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:10,160
Oh, I'm gonna heal you up.

3799
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:10,980
Alright, nice.

3800
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:14,900
Okay, I need a- Oh, she has a podcast?

3801
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:20,180
Where are they?

3802
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:23,180
I'm a little scared that I don't know where they are.

3803
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:25,420
I'll give you an amp first.

3804
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:28,820
Wait, they're not- Who did I- Did I give nobody an amp?

3805
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:29,560
Whoops.

3806
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:32,620
That's awkward.

3807
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:34,860
Oh great, I wasted it.

3808
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:37,140
Oh, what?

3809
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:37,760
Where are they?

3810
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:43,120
Where the fuck are they?

3811
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:45,380
Oh, there's another team here.

3812
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:48,680
I know there is.

3813
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:50,000
I'm too scared to go down.

3814
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:52,720
Oh my god.

3815
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:55,020
I knew I heard them.

3816
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:55,860
They're right below us.

3817
02:43:57,740 --> 02:43:58,760
They're right below us.

3818
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:00,060
Mr. Rat, go in there, Mr. Rat.

3819
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:01,140
That's fucking right.

3820
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:03,120
But they didn't expect a second person.

3821
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:10,620
That's fucking right.

3822
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:11,620
Or the third!

3823
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:15,280
Oh yeah?

3824
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:16,960
I can go up there too.

3825
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:21,080
That's fucking right.

3826
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:23,120
That's fucking right.

3827
02:44:23,460 --> 02:44:24,540
Give me your money.

3828
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:25,960
Give me your lunch money.

3829
02:44:31,670 --> 02:44:32,810
Bro, I'm trusting my bro.

3830
02:44:34,470 --> 02:44:36,210
Just giving my daily trust.

3831
02:44:38,270 --> 02:44:39,130
Alright, let's see.

3832
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:40,190
Let's try the wing bang again.

3833
02:44:43,150 --> 02:44:43,590
Nice.

3834
02:44:47,010 --> 02:44:48,310
I'm locked in.

3835
02:44:48,930 --> 02:44:50,710
Five dollars for Doki.

3836
02:44:50,830 --> 02:44:52,190
JT, thank you for the super chat.

3837
02:44:52,290 --> 02:44:52,530
Thank you.

3838
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:53,090
Thank you.

3839
02:44:53,090 --> 02:44:54,090
I appreciate it, man.

3840
02:44:54,190 --> 02:44:54,850
Thank you so much.

3841
02:44:56,030 --> 02:44:57,410
Alright, let's get rid of these.

3842
02:44:58,810 --> 02:44:59,330
Surely.

3843
02:44:59,570 --> 02:45:00,550
Yeah, it's Trustnut.

3844
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:02,090
I told you.

3845
02:45:02,210 --> 02:45:03,450
It's not toxic.

3846
02:45:03,510 --> 02:45:04,610
I'm trusting him.

3847
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:09,230
Alright.

3848
02:45:09,230 --> 02:45:10,010
Let's see.

3849
02:45:11,210 --> 02:45:12,250
What's the...

3850
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:13,010
Oh.

3851
02:45:13,590 --> 02:45:14,250
Oh, wait.

3852
02:45:14,310 --> 02:45:14,810
I hear people.

3853
02:45:16,590 --> 02:45:17,770
They're like right here.

3854
02:45:19,110 --> 02:45:20,230
I hear the res.

3855
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:23,850
The T in T-Bag stands for teamwork.

3856
02:45:23,990 --> 02:45:24,510
Exactly!

3857
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:25,870
Somebody gets it!

3858
02:45:27,630 --> 02:45:29,530
I'm glad somebody gets it now.

3859
02:45:30,650 --> 02:45:31,450
Oh shit.

3860
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:33,130
There's a fight.

3861
02:45:33,670 --> 02:45:34,530
Oh my god.

3862
02:45:34,570 --> 02:45:35,110
Pillow Princess.

3863
02:45:35,290 --> 02:45:35,930
You go, girl.

3864
02:45:39,010 --> 02:45:39,730
Watch this.

3865
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:42,610
I'm gonna take it.

3866
02:45:51,890 --> 02:45:54,330
This is not Trustnut.

3867
02:45:58,290 --> 02:46:00,370
You see, you wait until they're done.

3868
02:46:00,590 --> 02:46:01,550
You wait until they res.

3869
02:46:02,070 --> 02:46:03,010
So like...

3870
02:46:03,690 --> 02:46:05,590
So you don't have to do anything at all.

3871
02:46:05,870 --> 02:46:06,970
That's my favorite part.

3872
02:46:07,490 --> 02:46:09,110
When you just wait for them to res.

3873
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:12,850
So you don't actually have to do real work when it comes to fighting.

3874
02:46:13,030 --> 02:46:13,490
I'm gonna go.

3875
02:46:14,290 --> 02:46:14,730
I'm gonna go.

3876
02:46:14,770 --> 02:46:15,910
Like right here.

3877
02:46:15,990 --> 02:46:16,510
I see them.

3878
02:46:16,750 --> 02:46:17,730
Where's my portal?

3879
02:46:18,110 --> 02:46:19,130
Where's my ult?

3880
02:46:22,230 --> 02:46:23,310
What the fuck?

3881
02:46:23,530 --> 02:46:24,710
Who is this guy?

3882
02:46:30,570 --> 02:46:32,550
Who the fuck is this random guy?

3883
02:46:35,670 --> 02:46:36,150
Okay.

3884
02:46:36,250 --> 02:46:37,410
I think I might accidentally need myself.

3885
02:46:40,330 --> 02:46:43,010
I have to make sure I don't accidentally need myself.

3886
02:46:43,550 --> 02:46:44,430
Where are they?

3887
02:46:45,490 --> 02:46:45,970
Wait.

3888
02:46:46,010 --> 02:46:46,690
Where did he res?

3889
02:46:48,250 --> 02:46:48,770
What the

3890
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:53,470
fuck?

3891
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:53,850
Okay.

3892
02:46:53,930 --> 02:46:54,670
I was gonna say.

3893
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:58,470
I thought the guy that fucking jumped in was my own team.

3894
02:46:59,650 --> 02:47:02,070
Like... I was like, what the fuck?

3895
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:04,870
Bro, I'm on your team, bro.

3896
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:10,630
I was like...

3897
02:47:11,370 --> 02:47:14,470
I can't believe my team didn't fucking jump in with me.

3898
02:47:14,770 --> 02:47:16,190
That's fucked up, bro.

3899
02:47:17,730 --> 02:47:19,050
Sacrifice... I'm a conduit.

3900
02:47:19,090 --> 02:47:20,990
I should not be sacrificing my life.

3901
02:47:22,590 --> 02:47:24,890
I could have played backline, but I didn't.

3902
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:26,990
Because I trusted my team.

3903
02:47:28,950 --> 02:47:30,130
So messed up.

3904
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:33,830
Did I hear anything?

3905
02:47:33,990 --> 02:47:34,750
No, that wasn't it.

3906
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:36,290
I heard something.

3907
02:47:37,370 --> 02:47:38,670
Oh, it's so messed up.

3908
02:47:39,510 --> 02:47:40,410
They like...

3909
02:47:40,410 --> 02:47:42,130
They went in there without...

3910
02:47:42,130 --> 02:47:44,330
Like I went in there and they didn't follow me up.

3911
02:47:46,430 --> 02:47:47,950
I have too many mid-kits.

3912
02:47:49,910 --> 02:47:50,390
Alright.

3913
02:47:50,450 --> 02:47:51,130
Let's go to zone.

3914
02:47:52,590 --> 02:47:54,830
Wait, I could grab... I'm gonna grab this armor and then I'll go to zone.

3915
02:47:56,830 --> 02:47:57,230
Yeah.

3916
02:47:57,930 --> 02:47:58,730
It wasn't...

3917
02:47:58,730 --> 02:48:00,770
It didn't like... reciprocate.

3918
02:48:02,110 --> 02:48:02,870
That... that...

3919
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:04,570
You have to make sure you both reciprocate.

3920
02:48:06,510 --> 02:48:07,310
There really...

3921
02:48:07,310 --> 02:48:08,450
A railing here?

3922
02:48:08,610 --> 02:48:09,210
Nice, there is.

3923
02:48:09,410 --> 02:48:09,790
Nice.

3924
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:10,170
Okay.

3925
02:48:10,650 --> 02:48:12,270
I noticed this isn't on the map anymore.

3926
02:48:12,370 --> 02:48:12,930
The railings.

3927
02:48:15,030 --> 02:48:16,810
Usually they're on the map, but they're not.

3928
02:48:18,050 --> 02:48:19,390
Or like this one wasn't.

3929
02:48:20,710 --> 02:48:21,190
Oh!

3930
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:22,310
Who hit me?

3931
02:48:23,890 --> 02:48:25,310
Oh, he has red armor.

3932
02:48:30,970 --> 02:48:31,930
Oh, shit.

3933
02:48:38,820 --> 02:48:40,580
That's when you know they've been gaming.

3934
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:43,580
Where are they?

3935
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:48,460
Right there.

3936
02:48:48,700 --> 02:48:49,260
Let's see.

3937
02:48:52,680 --> 02:48:53,160
No!

3938
02:48:53,320 --> 02:48:53,840
Oh, shit.

3939
02:48:54,660 --> 02:48:55,680
Get closer!

3940
02:48:56,480 --> 02:48:57,540
Not that close!

3941
02:48:57,780 --> 02:48:58,600
I didn't mean you!

3942
02:48:58,840 --> 02:48:59,440
I didn't mean you!

3943
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:04,380
I meant the other lifeline.

3944
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:06,140
I didn't mean this pathfinder.

3945
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:10,040
There's a guy right here.

3946
02:49:11,180 --> 02:49:12,260
What the fuck?

3947
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:14,440
Wait!

3948
02:49:14,840 --> 02:49:16,220
That's a different guy!

3949
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:21,140
Oh, god.

3950
02:49:21,240 --> 02:49:21,640
Can I?

3951
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:22,840
Oh, god.

3952
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:23,760
Please.

3953
02:49:25,420 --> 02:49:25,580
No!

3954
02:49:26,680 --> 02:49:27,600
I can't!

3955
02:49:33,300 --> 02:49:33,740
I made it!

3956
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:34,900
Oh, my god!

3957
02:49:35,260 --> 02:49:35,660
Thank you.

3958
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:39,060
What the fuck?

3959
02:49:39,140 --> 02:49:39,940
I made it!

3960
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:42,000
Oh, my god.

3961
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:44,040
I fucking made it.

3962
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:44,560
Run!

3963
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:45,500
Run!

3964
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:49,040
That was close.

3965
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:50,800
That was actually...

3966
02:49:50,800 --> 02:49:51,280
That was clutch.

3967
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:53,020
That was a good ult.

3968
02:49:53,860 --> 02:49:54,580
What a...

3969
02:49:54,580 --> 02:49:55,280
My hero.

3970
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:57,400
That was actually an incredible ult.

3971
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:00,880
She saved my life.

3972
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:03,480
So...

3973
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:05,820
If you find our seats in your cheeks.

3974
02:50:06,280 --> 02:50:08,660
I did not expect her to actually help me.

3975
02:50:09,280 --> 02:50:10,200
That's insane!

3976
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:11,760
All right.

3977
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:12,000
Let's go.

3978
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:16,800
Surely, we're not gonna let everybody know we're here, right?

3979
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:19,200
Oh, weee!

3980
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:22,740
Trust.

3981
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:24,660
Told you!

3982
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:25,420
In the trust bag.

3983
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:28,140
I knew it existed.

3984
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:30,400
I'm gonna grab this too.

3985
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:31,880
I want a red armor.

3986
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:36,160
Alright, we're in zone!

3987
02:50:36,820 --> 02:50:42,420
I need to craft a bat for wasting my bats there earlier.

3988
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:43,980
Yeah!

3989
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:45,680
Alright.

3990
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:49,540
Got my bat.

3991
02:50:52,240 --> 02:50:53,740
That was actually crazy though.

3992
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:54,600
The fucking...

3993
02:50:55,640 --> 02:50:58,860
The fucking ult actually saved my life.

3994
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:00,780
Because I'm pretty sure those are two teams.

3995
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:02,680
There had to be two teams.

3996
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:03,460
There's no way.

3997
02:51:04,420 --> 02:51:06,900
There's no fucking way it was not two teams.

3998
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:10,180
Where could they be?

3999
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:14,320
Oh, care package.

4000
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:16,320
What's in it?

4001
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:18,220
What's in the care package?

4002
02:51:18,460 --> 02:51:19,180
Sir, look up!

4003
02:51:19,580 --> 02:51:20,500
Look up, sir!

4004
02:51:21,740 --> 02:51:23,920
Look up and tell me what's in the package!

4005
02:51:26,460 --> 02:51:26,940
Please!

4006
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:28,740
All you have to do is...

4007
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:29,320
Just look up!

4008
02:51:29,660 --> 02:51:30,160
I'm gonna...

4009
02:51:30,740 --> 02:51:31,600
Please, rat!

4010
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:33,380
Mr. Rat!

4011
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:36,320
That's all you have to do!

4012
02:51:36,860 --> 02:51:38,120
Just look up!

4013
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:41,700
That's all I want!

4014
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:46,340
Oh, okay.

4015
02:51:46,440 --> 02:51:46,880
There we go.

4016
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:47,660
He looked up, guys.

4017
02:51:47,900 --> 02:51:49,560
It only took him 20 years.

4018
02:51:50,120 --> 02:51:51,700
But he finally did it.

4019
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:55,700
He accomplished something that no man has ever done before.

4020
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:57,040
Looking up.

4021
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:00,500
Okay, that was a sick shot from how far I was looking at.

4022
02:52:01,980 --> 02:52:02,880
That should be a...

4023
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:04,440
Oh, I thought that would be like a...

4024
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:06,900
A armor upgrade.

4025
02:52:10,350 --> 02:52:11,130
Where is he?

4026
02:52:13,950 --> 02:52:15,170
Get shit on.

4027
02:52:16,490 --> 02:52:17,390
Get shit on!

4028
02:52:19,290 --> 02:52:19,770
Alright.

4029
02:52:20,890 --> 02:52:22,030
Gamers don't look up.

4030
02:52:22,030 --> 02:52:23,490
He accomplished something new today.

4031
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:26,590
Is there an angle here?

4032
02:52:26,770 --> 02:52:27,170
I do.

4033
02:52:27,830 --> 02:52:30,290
Aw, that would've been so cool if I hit that, like...

4034
02:52:31,030 --> 02:52:31,750
Over there.

4035
02:52:33,830 --> 02:52:34,630
Let's see.

4036
02:52:36,150 --> 02:52:36,810
Wait, what?

4037
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:37,810
Oh, shit!

4038
02:52:37,870 --> 02:52:38,330
Mr. Rat!

4039
02:52:38,550 --> 02:52:39,670
The world got you!

4040
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:45,080
It's so like...

4041
02:52:45,640 --> 02:52:46,860
You can't crawl up.

4042
02:52:48,060 --> 02:52:48,500
Nice.

4043
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:50,820
I just didn't want them to crawl up.

4044
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:51,120
Oh, wait!

4045
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:52,080
There's another fight here too!

4046
02:52:55,380 --> 02:52:57,560
Wait, I wanna fight this guy as well.

4047
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:00,780
They're like...

4048
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:03,120
So far away from each other.

4049
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:07,940
And there's the lifeline as well.

4050
02:53:09,700 --> 02:53:11,040
Wait, the lifeline team won?

4051
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:13,140
Oh my god, it's the goddamn triple...

4052
02:53:13,140 --> 02:53:14,020
Bro, fuck off!

4053
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:17,180
It's the goddamn triple take lifeline!

4054
02:53:21,080 --> 02:53:23,060
I'm trying to like, figure out where like...

4055
02:53:24,980 --> 02:53:25,600
There we go.

4056
02:53:26,140 --> 02:53:27,100
Yeah, fuck you.

4057
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:28,460
Thanks for the red armor, loser.

4058
02:53:29,560 --> 02:53:30,440
Oh shit!

4059
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:33,000
Wow!

4060
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:35,900
Let me in.

4061
02:53:35,980 --> 02:53:36,440
Let me in.

4062
02:53:43,210 --> 02:53:44,610
Wait, is he gonna shot at now?

4063
02:53:47,070 --> 02:53:49,330
Okay, that was a little fucking scary.

4064
02:53:53,310 --> 02:53:54,790
Oh, he's gonna go to the zone?

4065
02:53:55,150 --> 02:53:55,590
Alright.

4066
02:53:56,050 --> 02:53:57,310
I can deal with that.

4067
02:53:58,550 --> 02:53:59,790
I just have better...

4068
02:54:00,610 --> 02:54:02,490
I just have high ground, you know?

4069
02:54:02,610 --> 02:54:04,070
I love high ground here.

4070
02:54:05,790 --> 02:54:06,650
Wait, are we fighting?

4071
02:54:06,970 --> 02:54:07,770
What are we doing?

4072
02:54:08,030 --> 02:54:09,530
What's the decision, Mr. Rat?

4073
02:54:11,230 --> 02:54:12,190
Let me in.

4074
02:54:12,290 --> 02:54:14,350
I feel like this person actually knows how to play...

4075
02:54:14,350 --> 02:54:15,730
Ultra more than me.

4076
02:54:16,250 --> 02:54:16,950
Not sure.

4077
02:54:17,190 --> 02:54:19,390
My portals are just Hail Marys.

4078
02:54:20,090 --> 02:54:21,770
It's just like, will this work?

4079
02:54:24,250 --> 02:54:25,170
Those are...

4080
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:26,730
Those are my...

4081
02:54:26,730 --> 02:54:27,030
Whoa!

4082
02:54:27,270 --> 02:54:27,750
Shit!

4083
02:54:28,830 --> 02:54:29,310
Oh.

4084
02:54:29,330 --> 02:54:29,770
Oh, shit.

4085
02:54:29,770 --> 02:54:31,110
Yes I...

4086
02:54:31,790 --> 02:54:32,930
Yes I leave.

4087
02:54:34,370 --> 02:54:35,930
Yes I leave...

4088
02:54:35,930 --> 02:54:36,710
Well...

4089
02:54:36,710 --> 02:54:38,110
Yes I leave.

4090
02:54:38,690 --> 02:54:38,990
Bye.

4091
02:54:42,410 --> 02:54:43,490
Alright, here you go.

4092
02:54:43,850 --> 02:54:47,810
Yeah, her portals are for some reason 100% better than mine.

4093
02:54:48,030 --> 02:54:48,990
I don't know how...

4094
02:54:48,990 --> 02:54:49,970
How she does it.

4095
02:54:51,670 --> 02:54:55,330
For some very odd reason, they really know how to portal.

4096
02:55:00,320 --> 02:55:02,560
I want them to push into the other team.

4097
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:05,940
Bro, stop!

4098
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:08,120
Stop!

4099
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:09,740
Stop!

4100
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:12,800
They're running at each other!

4101
02:55:12,860 --> 02:55:13,360
They're running at each other!

4102
02:55:15,780 --> 02:55:17,200
Wait, we should run at each other!

4103
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:19,460
They're running!

4104
02:55:19,560 --> 02:55:19,920
They're running!

4105
02:55:19,980 --> 02:55:20,300
Let's go!

4106
02:55:20,420 --> 02:55:20,640
Let's go!

4107
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:20,940
Let's go!

4108
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:23,960
They're not running at each other anymore.

4109
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:32,200
Okay, I'll take this.

4110
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:33,520
What the fuck?

4111
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:34,120
He's so fast!

4112
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:36,280
He's so fast!

4113
02:55:39,580 --> 02:55:41,720
Did you see that?

4114
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:46,160
He's so fast!

4115
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:48,600
Bro, he's...

4116
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:54,160
I cracked him.

4117
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,960
He was so fucking fast, man.

4118
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:05,780
I got him.

4119
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:09,620
I don't want him to get rezzed.

4120
02:56:12,180 --> 02:56:12,680
Okay.

4121
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:14,660
What?

4122
02:56:15,380 --> 02:56:16,620
Oh my god, he helped!

4123
02:56:17,140 --> 02:56:18,000
Guys, please!

4124
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:20,400
Please don't lose this!

4125
02:56:20,580 --> 02:56:22,140
Please don't lose...

4126
02:56:22,140 --> 02:56:22,240
No!

4127
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:23,300
They're gonna rezz!

4128
02:56:23,540 --> 02:56:24,460
Where's my team?

4129
02:56:24,660 --> 02:56:25,000
No!

4130
02:56:28,020 --> 02:56:28,520
Rezz!

4131
02:56:29,580 --> 02:56:30,080
No!

4132
02:56:30,140 --> 02:56:31,080
Guys, no!

4133
02:56:33,430 --> 02:56:33,850
No!

4134
02:56:33,950 --> 02:56:34,770
This is a wrap!

4135
02:56:34,910 --> 02:56:35,910
Where was my team?

4136
02:56:37,210 --> 02:56:37,390
No!

4137
02:56:38,490 --> 02:56:39,130
Bro!

4138
02:56:39,590 --> 02:56:41,770
If we rush them, we win!

4139
02:56:42,370 --> 02:56:44,170
I literally got a knock!

4140
02:56:44,490 --> 02:56:46,470
I got a knock for us!

4141
02:56:46,910 --> 02:56:47,550
No!

4142
02:56:47,870 --> 02:56:48,810
I got...

4143
02:56:50,560 --> 02:56:53,320
I can't believe it!

4144
02:56:54,220 --> 02:56:55,760
Bro, it's over!

4145
02:56:55,960 --> 02:56:58,440
This is why if I don't get ulti, it's over.

4146
02:56:58,780 --> 02:57:00,740
I got a knock and everything!

4147
02:57:00,980 --> 02:57:02,360
I did so much damage!

4148
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:04,940
I did so much...

4149
02:57:04,940 --> 02:57:08,940
I did so much damage!

4150
02:57:08,940 --> 02:57:09,520
I did so much damage!

4151
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:12,920
Where was my team?

4152
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:16,680
Look, all I'm saying was I did my part.

4153
02:57:17,020 --> 02:57:23,140
I did my part of this game.

4154
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:24,980
Okay, we'll do one more.

4155
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:26,840
We'll do one more Trios and one more solo.

4156
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:29,240
It was so winnable.

4157
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:31,160
It was so fucking winnable.

4158
02:57:35,400 --> 02:57:36,620
I fucking...

4159
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:37,360
She didn't trust.

4160
02:57:37,440 --> 02:57:38,580
Yeah, I held my hand out.

4161
02:57:45,580 --> 02:57:46,820
I don't understand!

4162
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:48,080
I don't understand!

4163
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:49,560
I don't understand!

4164
02:57:49,580 --> 02:57:52,360
I don't understand!

4165
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:54,980
Oh my god.

4166
02:57:56,460 --> 02:57:57,180
Okay.

4167
02:57:58,340 --> 02:58:01,840
My fucking bow check aim was fucking crazy.

4168
02:58:01,960 --> 02:58:06,480
I was actually going nuclear there with my bow check.

4169
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,460
I can't believe it.

4170
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:16,140
How could they do this to me?

4171
02:58:18,960 --> 02:58:19,600
Okay.

4172
02:58:25,860 --> 02:58:26,860
This is it.

4173
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:29,660
Your team waste- I know!

4174
02:58:29,820 --> 02:58:31,040
They wasted my effort!

4175
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:34,920
Okay, my favorite part was the fucking guy that was zooming though.

4176
02:58:35,180 --> 02:58:37,320
The fucking ulti.

4177
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:42,480
That just fucking zoomed as they crawled to their fucking death.

4178
02:58:44,500 --> 02:58:45,180
I know!

4179
02:58:45,220 --> 02:58:46,480
How could they not trust me?

4180
02:58:47,380 --> 02:58:51,840
Like, this is the face of somebody that's trustworthy and wouldn't let you die.

4181
02:58:56,110 --> 02:58:56,590
Okay.

4182
02:58:56,870 --> 02:58:58,190
We got a flatline.

4183
02:58:58,270 --> 02:58:59,930
Oh my gosh, I haven't used flatline in so long.

4184
02:59:03,470 --> 02:59:04,250
Let's see.

4185
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:06,630
Okay.

4186
02:59:06,710 --> 02:59:08,910
Nice, I needed the holo on the flatty.

4187
02:59:11,350 --> 02:59:11,830
Ehhh.

4188
02:59:12,050 --> 02:59:13,570
I don't like it on this.

4189
02:59:14,690 --> 02:59:15,170
Alright.

4190
02:59:15,250 --> 02:59:15,830
Here we go.

4191
02:59:15,970 --> 02:59:16,630
Oh shit!

4192
02:59:17,170 --> 02:59:18,290
Creepy slave, don't worry!

4193
02:59:18,870 --> 02:59:19,490
I got you!

4194
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:21,430
Trust.

4195
02:59:24,370 --> 02:59:24,770
See?

4196
02:59:24,930 --> 02:59:26,570
I hit one shot out of four.

4197
02:59:31,460 --> 02:59:32,460
Oh my god, wait.

4198
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:33,400
He needs help.

4199
02:59:35,880 --> 02:59:36,280
Okay.

4200
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:39,600
I'm coming over.

4201
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:41,560
I don't know where this is gonna go.

4202
02:59:46,840 --> 02:59:47,240
There.

4203
02:59:47,360 --> 02:59:48,200
I told you!

4204
02:59:49,180 --> 02:59:49,580
Trust!

4205
02:59:52,200 --> 02:59:52,680
Nice.

4206
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:53,560
We did it.

4207
02:59:54,780 --> 02:59:55,260
Easy.

4208
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:57,620
Fucking easy.

4209
02:59:58,960 --> 03:00:00,720
It's all about the trust, baby.

4210
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:01,460
Okay.

4211
03:00:01,460 --> 03:00:02,940
Extend highlights, reduce alt.

4212
03:00:03,020 --> 03:00:04,340
I don't think I need the alt.

4213
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:06,780
I like the health thing more.

4214
03:00:08,780 --> 03:00:09,740
I did it.

4215
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:11,480
Excuse me, I have one kill.

4216
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:12,500
I got my one.

4217
03:00:15,540 --> 03:00:16,280
Let's see.

4218
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:19,100
Uh... You know what?

4219
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:20,060
I wanna do more wingy.

4220
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:23,180
Surely I'll eventually hit those shots.

4221
03:00:25,160 --> 03:00:25,680
Surely.

4222
03:00:25,940 --> 03:00:26,460
Surely.

4223
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:32,060
I believe.

4224
03:00:32,760 --> 03:00:35,360
It's all about believing in myself too.

4225
03:00:35,400 --> 03:00:36,680
I trust myself as well.

4226
03:00:39,980 --> 03:00:40,500
Alright.

4227
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:41,840
Wait, they're all taking the rail.

4228
03:00:44,060 --> 03:00:45,560
Let me... Let me on.

4229
03:00:45,580 --> 03:00:46,440
Let me on the rail.

4230
03:00:47,020 --> 03:00:48,500
I wanna get on the ride.

4231
03:00:48,500 --> 03:00:51,060
I wanna get on the crazy ride.

4232
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:54,620
It's all about coping.

4233
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:55,520
I'll hit.

4234
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:55,940
Might hit.

4235
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:56,540
Okay, look.

4236
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:58,260
I hit at least one shot.

4237
03:00:58,540 --> 03:01:00,680
And that's more... more than...

4238
03:01:05,360 --> 03:01:06,480
That's more than shot.

4239
03:01:09,700 --> 03:01:11,500
All I'm saying...

4240
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:14,600
Alright.

4241
03:01:14,820 --> 03:01:15,520
Let's see.

4242
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:17,000
Woo!

4243
03:01:20,760 --> 03:01:21,200
Woah!

4244
03:01:21,420 --> 03:01:21,860
Woah!

4245
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:22,220
Hold on!

4246
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:24,200
That's all I'm saying.

4247
03:01:24,420 --> 03:01:24,780
I don't know.

4248
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:25,860
That's all I'm saying.

4249
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:28,500
Wait, people died here.

4250
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:29,620
So I can steal this loot.

4251
03:01:31,620 --> 03:01:32,060
Yoink.

4252
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:34,100
Oh my god!

4253
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:35,440
Look at all this free loot!

4254
03:01:35,620 --> 03:01:36,560
Wait, this is amazing.

4255
03:01:40,530 --> 03:01:40,970
Yoink.

4256
03:01:42,230 --> 03:01:42,670
Where?

4257
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:49,840
Where?

4258
03:01:50,960 --> 03:01:51,640
Oh, there!

4259
03:01:53,480 --> 03:01:55,180
Okay, let me bring out the other gun.

4260
03:01:57,440 --> 03:02:00,900
Let me bring... Let me bring out the gun that I...

4261
03:02:00,900 --> 03:02:03,160
That I can actually hit.

4262
03:02:08,660 --> 03:02:09,180
Okay.

4263
03:02:09,320 --> 03:02:10,080
There we go.

4264
03:02:13,820 --> 03:02:14,340
Yay.

4265
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:15,440
Look.

4266
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:16,520
I still hit those.

4267
03:02:17,120 --> 03:02:18,760
I still hit it, guys.

4268
03:02:19,560 --> 03:02:21,140
I still hit it, guys.

4269
03:02:22,520 --> 03:02:23,760
Shit, I actually tabbed out.

4270
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:27,740
We've all been there before.

4271
03:02:30,720 --> 03:02:31,460
Okay, nice.

4272
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:33,300
I should craft the bat.

4273
03:02:36,320 --> 03:02:36,780
Yay.

4274
03:02:38,300 --> 03:02:39,940
Anything else I haven't looted yet?

4275
03:02:41,140 --> 03:02:42,180
Oh, what the fuck?

4276
03:02:42,320 --> 03:02:42,720
I should...

4277
03:02:42,720 --> 03:02:43,000
Woah!

4278
03:02:43,620 --> 03:02:44,360
Wait, I don't like that.

4279
03:02:44,380 --> 03:02:44,720
That's funny.

4280
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:48,160
It like fucking spat out a battery in front of me.

4281
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:49,660
Let's see.

4282
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:50,440
That's enough.

4283
03:02:50,960 --> 03:02:52,360
You guys think I have too many bats?

4284
03:02:52,660 --> 03:02:53,200
No, right?

4285
03:02:54,180 --> 03:02:54,580
Nah.

4286
03:02:55,280 --> 03:02:56,880
I should grab a sniper too.

4287
03:02:58,260 --> 03:02:59,020
Alright, here we go.

4288
03:03:00,420 --> 03:03:01,300
Oh shit, don't worry.

4289
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:01,600
I'm here.

4290
03:03:02,540 --> 03:03:04,420
I'm gonna put this... here.

4291
03:03:07,220 --> 03:03:07,660
It's alright.

4292
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:09,800
We can fall back if we need to.

4293
03:03:10,460 --> 03:03:11,120
I believe.

4294
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:15,120
I feel like we don't need that many.

4295
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:17,280
Okay, I definitely need more shield cells though.

4296
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:18,320
Where?

4297
03:03:19,640 --> 03:03:20,040
There?

4298
03:03:31,470 --> 03:03:31,950
Haha!

4299
03:03:32,350 --> 03:03:35,030
Even Octane was like, what the...

4300
03:03:41,420 --> 03:03:43,780
Even Octane was like, hmm...

4301
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:47,360
Oh my god.

4302
03:03:50,980 --> 03:03:52,340
Oh, he's so low.

4303
03:03:57,180 --> 03:03:58,740
Oh my god, he's so low too.

4304
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:02,220
Oh god, the last guy is on me.

4305
03:04:05,820 --> 03:04:06,440
Oh god.

4306
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:08,180
He's not gonna look at me, right?

4307
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:11,260
Bro, I'm so confused!

4308
03:04:15,700 --> 03:04:17,960
He's like, where the fuck did this go?

4309
03:04:23,440 --> 03:04:25,540
And he was like, what the fuck?

4310
03:04:28,060 --> 03:04:28,920
And I hear him.

4311
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:34,460
What?!

4312
03:04:37,250 --> 03:04:39,190
Oh, he was on me this entire time.

4313
03:04:39,670 --> 03:04:41,130
Wait, this is a different guy!

4314
03:04:41,850 --> 03:04:43,770
He wasn't on me this entire time!

4315
03:04:43,850 --> 03:04:44,850
He was a new guy!

4316
03:05:03,150 --> 03:05:03,930
There, he's dead.

4317
03:05:04,510 --> 03:05:05,210
There you go.

4318
03:05:05,450 --> 03:05:07,130
I had to think for a little bit.

4319
03:05:09,790 --> 03:05:10,670
There you go, we're fine.

4320
03:05:11,290 --> 03:05:13,090
I gotta think, but it's okay.

4321
03:05:15,810 --> 03:05:16,410
That is so cool.

4322
03:05:16,430 --> 03:05:16,590
See?

4323
03:05:16,810 --> 03:05:17,590
We did it.

4324
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:20,070
We fucking did it, guys!

4325
03:05:20,250 --> 03:05:20,950
We're a team!

4326
03:05:22,290 --> 03:05:22,850
Yay!

4327
03:05:23,490 --> 03:05:25,670
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of...

4328
03:05:25,670 --> 03:05:27,210
It's not that I don't believe in myself.

4329
03:05:27,690 --> 03:05:29,010
It's that like...

4330
03:05:30,410 --> 03:05:34,310
Guys, it's not about a lack of belief at the moment.

4331
03:05:34,430 --> 03:05:38,430
It's just that I think it'd be better if I use this gun instead.

4332
03:05:40,670 --> 03:05:41,970
Just a little better.

4333
03:05:43,250 --> 03:05:45,010
I totally believe in myself.

4334
03:05:48,390 --> 03:05:48,910
Okay.

4335
03:05:48,970 --> 03:05:49,450
Let's see.

4336
03:05:49,670 --> 03:05:51,050
Is there like a 3x?

4337
03:05:51,170 --> 03:05:51,630
Oh, there is.

4338
03:05:52,870 --> 03:05:53,390
Oh.

4339
03:05:53,390 --> 03:05:53,910
Whoops.

4340
03:05:54,110 --> 03:05:55,490
I got rid of my 2x.

4341
03:05:56,510 --> 03:05:57,030
Whoops.

4342
03:05:58,970 --> 03:05:59,490
Okay.

4343
03:06:00,390 --> 03:06:00,910
No!

4344
03:06:01,750 --> 03:06:03,990
I got rid of my 2x!

4345
03:06:03,990 --> 03:06:04,710
I forgot!

4346
03:06:04,990 --> 03:06:05,950
Fuck off!

4347
03:06:07,030 --> 03:06:08,350
It's so far away!

4348
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:16,620
It's so far away!

4349
03:06:20,240 --> 03:06:22,500
Doki's cooldown on Wingman...

4350
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:25,560
Yeah, I like used up my Wingman cooldown, guys.

4351
03:06:26,060 --> 03:06:27,380
It's so unfortunate.

4352
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:32,140
It's so unfortunate, guys.

4353
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:35,880
Let's see.

4354
03:06:37,220 --> 03:06:38,360
Oh, this way.

4355
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:39,560
Whee!

4356
03:06:41,440 --> 03:06:42,080
Back.

4357
03:06:44,620 --> 03:06:45,260
Yay!

4358
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:47,960
This game is so easy.

4359
03:06:48,560 --> 03:06:49,860
Do I need to craft a bat?

4360
03:06:49,860 --> 03:06:50,720
No, I have six bats.

4361
03:06:50,840 --> 03:06:51,080
We're fine.

4362
03:06:51,460 --> 03:06:52,920
I need 2x though.

4363
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:55,700
I need 2x for this.

4364
03:06:57,320 --> 03:07:00,380
Or... I'd like flatline on 2x because I feel like...

4365
03:07:00,380 --> 03:07:01,320
It's just better.

4366
03:07:03,320 --> 03:07:05,140
It's a better... better scope.

4367
03:07:07,140 --> 03:07:07,780
Oh.

4368
03:07:07,860 --> 03:07:08,620
Where are they?

4369
03:07:08,740 --> 03:07:10,520
They're right here?!

4370
03:07:10,520 --> 03:07:11,780
Oh my god!

4371
03:07:11,820 --> 03:07:12,900
They're just chilling!

4372
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:14,960
Oh, it's two guys!

4373
03:07:15,480 --> 03:07:16,740
But it's two guys.

4374
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:17,920
Whoa!

4375
03:07:18,060 --> 03:07:18,900
I'm so fast!

4376
03:07:20,060 --> 03:07:21,040
It's literally two.

4377
03:07:22,540 --> 03:07:24,500
Instead of one guy, we get two guys.

4378
03:07:26,140 --> 03:07:26,580
Wooo!

4379
03:07:29,640 --> 03:07:31,660
No shield is gonna protect you.

4380
03:07:35,060 --> 03:07:36,000
Alright, this is it.

4381
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:38,160
Oh, they saw us too!

4382
03:07:41,020 --> 03:07:42,160
They'll do an A-no.

4383
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:44,540
They know it's a 3v2 now.

4384
03:07:45,060 --> 03:07:46,100
They fucking know.

4385
03:07:47,420 --> 03:07:48,620
Oh, is he looking at me?

4386
03:07:52,790 --> 03:07:53,990
Wait, does this guy have a 2x?

4387
03:07:54,110 --> 03:07:54,290
No.

4388
03:07:56,350 --> 03:07:57,310
No 2x.

4389
03:07:59,210 --> 03:08:00,030
Wait, I hear him.

4390
03:08:04,510 --> 03:08:05,370
He's over there.

4391
03:08:06,670 --> 03:08:07,150
Holy

4392
03:08:13,320 --> 03:08:13,800
shit!

4393
03:08:14,220 --> 03:08:15,280
Oh my god!

4394
03:08:15,380 --> 03:08:16,100
Oh, fuck!

4395
03:08:16,220 --> 03:08:16,440
Okay!

4396
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:17,080
Okay!

4397
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,040
Don't look at me!

4398
03:08:21,420 --> 03:08:22,500
It's okay, we did it.

4399
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:24,260
Oh my god, that was scary.

4400
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:26,120
There's no way he dies.

4401
03:08:26,200 --> 03:08:29,360
Oh my god, they looked at me.

4402
03:08:29,360 --> 03:08:30,120
Yay!

4403
03:08:32,340 --> 03:08:33,780
We did it!

4404
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:34,640
Yeah!

4405
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:38,540
So easy.

4406
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:41,240
The donking traction.

4407
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:43,980
Look at me, I'm so scared.

4408
03:08:49,140 --> 03:08:51,260
No door can stop me.

4409
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:53,800
They thought I would take...

4410
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:55,460
Oh my god, none of us broke 1k.

4411
03:08:55,600 --> 03:08:56,980
That is so sad.

4412
03:08:59,320 --> 03:09:00,220
None of us!

4413
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:01,980
We have like a predilection.

4414
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:03,820
None of us broke 1k.

4415
03:09:10,730 --> 03:09:14,750
I like how I could have used the door, but I didn't.

4416
03:09:14,790 --> 03:09:16,030
I was just like...

4417
03:09:17,590 --> 03:09:19,150
They'll never expect it!

4418
03:09:19,890 --> 03:09:21,650
They never expect it, guys.

4419
03:09:22,610 --> 03:09:26,110
They are all looking at the door, thinking I'd pop up.

4420
03:09:26,570 --> 03:09:28,710
But I wasn't using the door!

4421
03:09:28,710 --> 03:09:29,270
Always ready to pop up a door!

4422
03:09:33,670 --> 03:09:36,090
Yeah, I'm going to use the door.

4423
03:09:36,210 --> 03:09:46,730
Oh my god, it's so cute.

4424
03:09:46,750 --> 03:09:54,710
So cute.

4425
03:09:54,710 --> 03:09:56,550
Solo mode, where all dreams die.

4426
03:09:57,090 --> 03:09:59,090
Yeah, doors are for poor people!

4427
03:10:03,450 --> 03:10:04,950
I bought the DLC.

4428
03:10:05,130 --> 03:10:06,890
I don't need to use doors anymore.

4429
03:10:11,070 --> 03:10:12,050
Alright, here we go.

4430
03:10:13,150 --> 03:10:13,870
Last game.

4431
03:10:14,590 --> 03:10:15,290
Last game.

4432
03:10:15,470 --> 03:10:16,830
This might be a really fast game.

4433
03:10:17,770 --> 03:10:19,990
Honestly, this could be a very fast game.

4434
03:10:22,850 --> 03:10:24,850
Nobody to fight for Altaire.

4435
03:10:27,290 --> 03:10:28,410
Alright, here we go.

4436
03:10:31,510 --> 03:10:33,030
Alright, this is it.

4437
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:38,830
Yeah!

4438
03:10:40,470 --> 03:10:41,090
What's it mean?

4439
03:10:41,690 --> 03:10:44,290
Loba's Cheek 69, 420.

4440
03:10:45,220 --> 03:10:46,030
That seems right.

4441
03:10:46,470 --> 03:10:48,290
That seems right.

4442
03:10:48,610 --> 03:10:49,130
Alright!

4443
03:10:49,880 --> 03:10:51,970
We can... We go to our favorite place.

4444
03:10:53,250 --> 03:10:55,050
Where's the sniper perch?

4445
03:10:57,700 --> 03:11:01,330
If I'm going to snipe, I might as well go here.

4446
03:11:02,090 --> 03:11:03,610
It's sniping time!

4447
03:11:05,130 --> 03:11:05,730
Alright.

4448
03:11:08,950 --> 03:11:10,350
This is my only safe place.

4449
03:11:10,490 --> 03:11:12,570
This place made me live the longest.

4450
03:11:12,770 --> 03:11:14,270
So like, I feel the safest.

4451
03:11:15,910 --> 03:11:16,510
Honestly.

4452
03:11:16,510 --> 03:11:20,650
This is like, the only place that I feel safe at the moment.

4453
03:11:25,850 --> 03:11:26,610
Enemies nearby?

4454
03:11:26,930 --> 03:11:27,970
Not anymore.

4455
03:11:28,790 --> 03:11:30,470
I don't think anyone lands here.

4456
03:11:31,690 --> 03:11:32,010
That's good.

4457
03:11:32,210 --> 03:11:32,830
Thank God.

4458
03:11:33,450 --> 03:11:34,850
Thank fucking God.

4459
03:11:35,570 --> 03:11:36,470
For now.

4460
03:11:38,850 --> 03:11:40,450
This place is my sanctuary.

4461
03:11:40,990 --> 03:11:45,350
Out of all the solo modes I played, this was the only area that I lived the longest.

4462
03:11:45,870 --> 03:11:49,430
So, I literally... I don't trust anywhere else.

4463
03:11:51,290 --> 03:11:52,530
Okay, let's see.

4464
03:11:52,810 --> 03:11:53,410
Let's do it.

4465
03:11:54,030 --> 03:11:55,910
We need an actual sniper though.

4466
03:11:56,730 --> 03:11:58,810
Like, I found like a repeater.

4467
03:11:59,570 --> 03:12:00,670
With the PK.

4468
03:12:02,610 --> 03:12:03,750
There's nobody here.

4469
03:12:04,010 --> 03:12:04,530
Thank God.

4470
03:12:06,070 --> 03:12:06,590
Oh.

4471
03:12:07,530 --> 03:12:08,050
Okay.

4472
03:12:10,110 --> 03:12:11,310
Either works, you know?

4473
03:12:12,770 --> 03:12:14,870
Where the fuck are the snipers?

4474
03:12:16,470 --> 03:12:19,850
How am I supposed to snipe if I don't have the one thing I need?

4475
03:12:22,150 --> 03:12:23,290
Are you serious?

4476
03:12:26,410 --> 03:12:28,250
Where the fuck are the snipers?

4477
03:12:30,350 --> 03:12:30,870
Wait.

4478
03:12:31,110 --> 03:12:32,030
You hear that?

4479
03:12:34,190 --> 03:12:34,710
Wait.

4480
03:12:34,850 --> 03:12:35,690
Wait a minute.

4481
03:12:36,530 --> 03:12:37,850
I didn't loot that.

4482
03:12:39,010 --> 03:12:40,250
I didn't loot that.

4483
03:12:42,110 --> 03:12:43,290
Wait a minute.

4484
03:12:43,370 --> 03:12:44,390
What are you doing here?

4485
03:12:45,570 --> 03:12:47,370
What are you do- This is my strat!

4486
03:12:48,290 --> 03:12:49,630
What are you doing here?

4487
03:12:52,010 --> 03:12:53,750
This is my strat!

4488
03:12:56,050 --> 03:12:56,830
Oh no.

4489
03:13:11,850 --> 03:13:13,230
That's fucking right, bitch.

4490
03:13:17,900 --> 03:13:19,780
Yeah, you think that's gonna stop me?

4491
03:13:22,700 --> 03:13:23,220
Oh.

4492
03:13:25,280 --> 03:13:27,020
Oh, guys, I broke-

4493
03:13:31,740 --> 03:13:36,200
Guys, it might have stopped me.

4494
03:13:37,940 --> 03:13:38,460
Guys.

4495
03:13:40,140 --> 03:13:40,660
Guys!

4496
03:13:41,040 --> 03:13:42,500
He's shooting my feet!

4497
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:44,400
He's shooting my feet!

4498
03:13:52,780 --> 03:13:57,420
He's shooting my feet!

4499
03:13:57,800 --> 03:14:01,700
Wait, what the fuck?

4500
03:14:03,660 --> 03:14:05,440
Oh, no way.

4501
03:14:06,420 --> 03:14:08,380
No fucking way!

4502
03:14:09,380 --> 03:14:11,380
That's actually nothing!

4503
03:14:11,460 --> 03:14:13,750
Oh my god.

4504
03:14:13,750 --> 03:14:23,650
I wouldn't have thought that would- Bro, this game fucking- There's no fucking way!

4505
03:14:24,350 --> 03:14:26,890
That's actually bullshit!

4506
03:14:27,830 --> 03:14:28,610
Bro!

4507
03:14:29,550 --> 03:14:32,490
Bro, stop!

4508
03:14:33,330 --> 03:14:35,710
I went through so much, bro!

4509
03:14:37,190 --> 03:14:38,590
It's not fair!

4510
03:14:44,380 --> 03:14:45,960
That's not fair!

4511
03:14:46,900 --> 03:14:49,820
I went through so much man!

4512
03:14:50,180 --> 03:14:58,240
I can't believe it actually stopped me!

4513
03:14:58,800 --> 03:15:00,680
What is this?

4514
03:15:01,840 --> 03:15:04,660
Bro, it actually stopped me.

4515
03:15:05,760 --> 03:15:06,760
Oh, it's here.

4516
03:15:09,620 --> 03:15:12,060
You thought tap street is gonna fucking save you?

4517
03:15:16,440 --> 03:15:16,800
Okay.

4518
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:19,440
I might need shoes though.

4519
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:23,980
Oh that's smart.

4520
03:15:26,420 --> 03:15:26,780
No!

4521
03:15:31,250 --> 03:15:31,970
Oh shit.

4522
03:15:35,370 --> 03:15:38,030
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no!

4523
03:15:57,530 --> 03:15:58,370
I'm so sad.

4524
03:15:59,070 --> 03:16:00,470
I'm so sad.

4525
03:16:02,670 --> 03:16:05,870
I got... I got fucked so hard!

4526
03:16:07,270 --> 03:16:08,330
You know what?

4527
03:16:08,970 --> 03:16:14,250
That... that bug, I think that was a good time to call it.

4528
03:16:18,710 --> 03:16:22,410
What a game to end it on.

4529
03:16:22,630 --> 03:16:26,950
What a game to end it on.

4530
03:16:31,350 --> 03:16:33,710
Okay, guys, we're calling it here.

4531
03:16:33,810 --> 03:16:35,090
I have another stream later today.

4532
03:16:35,310 --> 03:16:36,790
In an hour, so...

4533
03:16:39,510 --> 03:16:46,670
I still can't believe... I can't believe that I'm hockey!

4534
03:16:47,230 --> 03:16:51,970
Why am I the one... why?

4535
03:16:52,550 --> 03:16:55,410
Anyway, we have a Tekken 8 stream next.

4536
03:16:55,710 --> 03:16:58,190
A great time though, playing a new season.

4537
03:16:58,390 --> 03:17:01,850
As always, everybody, say hi to DreamHackers.

4538
03:17:01,850 --> 03:17:03,690
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4539
03:17:03,790 --> 03:17:04,410
Say it up for me.

4540
03:17:04,550 --> 03:17:07,910
Say it a little longer for me to play Tekken 8 for the first time ever.

4541
03:17:08,150 --> 03:17:09,350
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4542
03:17:09,730 --> 03:17:10,430
Bye, guys.

4543
03:17:10,890 --> 03:17:11,250
Bye!

4544
03:17:12,170 --> 03:17:13,810
Also, slightly new ending screen.

4545
03:17:13,930 --> 03:17:14,350
You'll see now.

4546
03:17:14,570 --> 03:17:14,770
Bye!
