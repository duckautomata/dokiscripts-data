I don't know where Snuffy went.

256
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,940

What the fuck is going on?

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,860
Why are they making wormhole?

261
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Why are they making wormhole?

262
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,340
There's no base!

263
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,520
I can't respond because there's no more bases to respond in.

264
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,260
Oh no.

265
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,760
The game doesn't understand.

266
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,600
Also, how's the sound?

267
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,640
I don't know where my sound team is.

268
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,100
Are any of my mods online?

269
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,380
I'm actually scared.

270
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh my god.

271
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,960
Oh, I have to create a new lobby.

272
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,120
Okay.

273
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:22,920
Wait.

274
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,300
Oh, okay.

275
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,060
Oh, I was looking.

276
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,960
Oh, Discord.

Alright, let me look up.

283
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,440
Sound thing.

284
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,420
You bring sound down, but the overall...

285
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,240
Wait, what sound?

286
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,540
What?

287
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,520
Bring what sound?

288
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,100
Bring.

289
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,340
Bring down what sound?

290
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,640
Mons.

291
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,960
What do you mean by that?

292
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,060
Oh, just the effects?

293
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,280
Well, I can't do that now.

294
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,480
Wait, where is...

295
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,720
No, no, you click...

296
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
No, you click...

297
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,260
Play it again, and we all in the same lobby.

298
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,240
Now I got confused.

299
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,480
But I'll give her the...

300
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,900
Thing in.

301
00:24:31,620 --> 00:25:04,850

Basically, guys, we have everybody muted in just...

304
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,970
I believe in us.

305
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,670
We don't have a flag.

306
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,070
We...

307
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,610
We...

308
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:20,790
Okay.

309
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,130
We...

310
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,990
can...

311
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,830
do it.

312
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,850
...

313
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:32,910
...

314
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,070
Oh shit, wait, you're right.

315
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:38,830
You're right.

316
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,590
I have an idea.

317
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,250
I have an idea.

318
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,150
I don't think Snuffy knows that we're drawing the flag right now.

319
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,830
You're right.

320
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,290
I have an idea.

321
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,510
Okay.

322
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,960
Is that what raccoons look like?

323
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,820
I don't remember.

324
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,860
And then...

325
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,330
Shit.

326
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,190

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,890
If all of us work together, we can win this.

500
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,110
It has to be all of us together on a team.

502
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,050
How much more American does the game want from me?

503
00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:18,470
Oh, yeah, a rare live one thing it's discrimination it's discrimination against me and only me hi i'm like i was like the only one that was unmuted and everyone was just like a stream of consciousness and it was like yeah i didn't think anybody else was unmuting wait are you guys unmuting?

504
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:50,930
but since your game crashed i was like okay we should yeah are they talking to us either they just talk no while we're just talking I'm gonna leave the lobby I like how snuffy is still having us muted me in there or something so I will have to remake it I think at Doki unmute yeah I already unmuted you're unmuted yeah I was already I was listening to you guys I thought if you guys were yapping and stuff yeah exactly

514
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,930

667
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,410

Lyme killed both of them again.

00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,590
Life is actually...

677
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:22,350
Oh, fuck you, I want you to be doing all of us.

678

It's okay.

679
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:25,950
It's okay.

680
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,310
I've claimed another land for us.

681
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,350
I claimed that...

682
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,790
Oh, no, not our base.

683
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:42,430
I'm trying to figure out how to get out of this fucked mushroom world.

684
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,570
Okay, we got this.

685

00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,230
What's that?

690
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,970
Was that me accidentally using my other magic?

691
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,450
It's okay, I got...

692
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,670
I'm doing the objective.

693
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,030
I don't know what that was.

694
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,690
I think I actually said rock.

695
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:31,310
God, this is so hard to claim.

696
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:32,590
Yay!

697
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,010

00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,870
Okay, now I know what that does.

700
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,290
It's okay.

701
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,430
I have this spell.

702
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,270
It can only grow stronger.

703
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,730
I can save us.

704
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,670
Rock!

705
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,550

708
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,710

709
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:21,670

710
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,190
Rock!

711
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:25,630
Rock!

712
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,170
Rock!

713
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:36,510
Oh my god.

714
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,230
Oh shit.

715
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,410
It's fine.

716
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:45,630
Rock!

717
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,190
It's weird.

718
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:51,890

719
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:55,690
I

720
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,110

721
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,250
I got you!

722
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,370
Rock!

723
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,100
I don't have rock anymore.

724
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,140
Thank you, my fucking god.

725
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,190
I don't have rock.

726
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,870
That's all I needed.

727
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:41,890
It's okay.

728
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,730
I don't have rock anymore.

729
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:45,790
Wait.

730
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:46,410
Is he?

731
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,790
We did it!

732
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,010
We did it!

733
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,110
We did it guys!

734
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,140
Guys, it's okay, we did it though!

735
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,620
Wait, what?

736
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,840
It's really hard to know who is who.

737
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,020
Once I figure out sorcerers and the difference between wizards and sorcerers, it's easy.

738
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,880
I'm like, I can't tell if that's wrong.

739
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,720
Okay, what's...

740
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,280
Okay, what does it The hope is that...

741
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,520
The game does not recognize my accent at all.

742
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,480
And...

743
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,340
He's so like normally.

744
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,040
Wait, what's... Do you guys want to do with the large map?

745
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,360
Fire...

746
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,400
Wait, does that...

747
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,980
Wait, it actually made a fireball?

748
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,380
Wait, did it make a fireball?

749
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,100
Fireball.

750
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,280
Fireball.

751
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,600
I want to play again.

752
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,980
We're still playing the game.

753
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,880
All right, I'm going to click play again, guys.

754
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:00,680

755
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,880
Large map.

756
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,700

757
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,360

She's not in the game because if you press escape, fireball.

771
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,350
Okay, we got to kill each other.

772

Magic missile.

778
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:40,530
Oh wait, I can't kill myself with that.

Freeze.

801
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,050

Like, who is that?

843
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,640
Their warlocks have captured the crystal caverns.

01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:23,920
Yeah.

845
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,240

848
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,720
That was an NPC right there.

849
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,980
Wait, Snowfie never even claimed her flag.

850
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,020
Stupid.

851
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,680
That's right.

852
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,760
That's what she gets.

853
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,000
Yeah.

854
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,760
That's what she gets.

855
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,180
That's fucking right.

856
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,980
Now she has no home.

857
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,500
I wanted a truce.

858
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,400
Please don't hurt me, please.

859
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,380
Don't kill me, please.

860
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:53,800
Oh.

861
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,140
Now you want truce now?

862
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

863
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,720
I tried to get a truce before.

864
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,900
Oh, you want a truce now?

865
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,700
Oh, yeah.

866
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,780
Yeah, you want truce?

867
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,340
Or you want to die?

868
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,400
Do you want a truce or you want to die?

869
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,680
I heard those words before.

870
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,200
From a wizard.

871
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,540
An enemy wizard.

872
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,100
Fireball!

873
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,200

874
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,600
Fireball!

875
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,860
Oh shit, oh shit, do that!

876
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,520
Hello?

877
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:33,920
Mint?

878
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,320
Mint, we're on the same team!

879
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:45,650
I can't believe you would just say fireball like that.

880
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,390
Fireball!

881
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:51,810
Fireball!

882
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:52,650
Oh!

883
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:03,830
Where am I?

884
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,150
That's it.

885
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:07,630
That's how you get.

886
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,190
That's fucking it.

887
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:14,550
Where is she?

888
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:16,830
Fireball.

889
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:17,990
Oh wait, fireball.

890
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,450

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,380
Is that my hole?

1035
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:09,940
Hole.

1036
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,080
Hole.

01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:16,440
Wait, where are you guys?

1040
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,800
I'm in the hole, too.

1041
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,440
What's over here?

1042
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,100
The Ravidonks have captured the crystal cavern.

1043
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,680
I feel like there's nothing, yeah.

1044
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,240
It doesn't seem like there's anything here.

1045
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,640
What, but we gotta find a scalabry.

1046
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:47,260
Wait, wait, we can all, like, try...

1047
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:47,540
What?

1048
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,780
Why did she just go through the hole?

1049
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,580
Where did she go?

1050
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,100
Oh!

1051
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,520
Our hole expired.

1052
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:58,400
No!

1053
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,100
It's not a hole!

1054
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,580
It's like, we can just climb up.

1055
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,300
Yeah, it's kind of.

1056
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,720

01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,490
You don't have your Sherpa with you!

1070
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:45,350
Oh, shit.

1071
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:47,370
Oh!

1072
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:52,670
Oh!

1073
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,260
Yeah, frog just ate her.

1074
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,660
That's unfortunate.

1075
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,100
Where's your stuff?

1076
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,040
Wait, where's your stuff?

1077
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,500
Where's your stuff?

1078
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:10,700
No!

1079
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:17,590
Wait, what happened to me?

1080
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,030
No, my stabby!

1081
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,890
What happened to me?

1082
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:32,250
I wanted to steal Lamo's stuff.

1083
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,330
I got greedy.

1084
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,250
I got so greedy.

1085
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:36,090
No!

1086
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,090
Oh my god, my legs.

1087
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:40,350
I'm okay.

1088
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,570
I'm okay.

1089
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:48,610
See, I'm so healthy.

1090
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:49,490
What do I mean?

1091
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:53,490
Give me an ingredient, and I'll make you a powerful magical soup.

1092
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:56,150
What kind of ingredient does he want?

1093
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:59,670
I don't understand.

1094
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,070
What do you want, little guy?

1095
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:03,030
Frogman?

1096
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:06,270
No, I lost my pea stick.

1097
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:09,270
My pea sword.

1098
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,790
I lost it.

1099
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,170
Hey little guy.

1100
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,410
What is he doing?

1101
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:21,870
Yep.

1102
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,320
Fireball.

1103
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:34,270
Boy, you got your crystal.

1104
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,210
Is this what you want?

1105
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:44,350
What is this?

1106
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:49,490
What do I...

1107
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,190
What is this?

1108
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:52,930
What do I have?

1109
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:55,570
Okay, everyone's died in the fucking swamp.

1110
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,470
He was just a little guy.

1111
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:02,270
There's no such thing as little guys in wars.

1112
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:12,150
Fireball.

1113
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:13,950
Fireball.

1114
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:19,170
Hello?

1115
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:21,910
Hello?

1116
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:22,210
Hello?

1117
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,120
Hello?

1118
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,420
Hello?

1119
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,220
Oh hey!

1120
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,800
What happened to the others?

1121
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:38,200
Uh, Lymo's in there exploring.

1122
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,720
I think she- Do you want to go help her?

1123
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,420
Yeah, what's this?

1124
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:41,920
Have you tried the soup before?

1125
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,060
Oh, what is that?

1126
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,140
Oh, what

1127
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,580
is that?

1128
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,060
Fireball?

1129
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,540
Do you still have your sword?

1130
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:54,540
No.

1131
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,400
My peace sword got eaten.

1132
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,380
By the frog.

1133
01:18:59,200 --> 01:18:59,720
Yeah.

1134
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:01,740
I saw a goblin.

1135
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,240
Oh, really?

1136
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:05,340
Oh.

1137
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,280
It's okay.

1138
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,700
I drank a magic potion.

1139
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,580
So I should be really strong now.

1140
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:10,960
Okay.

1141
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,240
What does a magic potion do?

1142
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:13,820
Go in there.

1143
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,620
I'll fight him.

1144
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:15,060
Alright.

1145
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:15,740
I'm ready.

1146
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:16,740
With my torch.

1147
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:17,460
Okay, let's go.

1148
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,400
How do we go in?

1149
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:21,540
I believe in Doki.

1150
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:22,900
Alright.

1151
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:24,580
Whoa.

1152
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,510
Let's go in.

1153
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:43,430
Okay.

1154
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,150
Fireball.

1155
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:48,070
Oh, I hurt myself in confusion.

1156
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:51,590
I hurt myself.

1157
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:52,470
I hurt myself.

1158
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:55,310
I'm okay.

1159
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:55,890
I'm okay.

1160
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:57,810
Oh, my God.

1161
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,030
Oh, my God.

1162
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:00,890
She didn't live.

1163
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:01,910
She didn't live.

1164
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,090
She did not live.

1165
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:06,970
Oh.

1166
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:08,950
Oh my god!

1167
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:11,370
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

Okay, fireball.

1169
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:14,710
Fireball.

1170
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:16,190
Okay, I killed myself.

1171
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,240
Holy shit, that area is so loud.

1172
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:34,320
That episode, that area is so fucking loud.

1173
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,260
It's okay, we did our best.

1174
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,100
We're still alive.

Let me see how you get there.

1182
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,940
There's Excalibur in all the pieces.

1183
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,860
It's over there in front of me.

1184
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,590
I was trying to find things I could trade to the goblins for more spells.

1185
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:50,230
Oh, yeah.

1186
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:54,010

What are you trying to do?

1190
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,190
Did he actually give me anything?

1191
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:03,370
They look like they could, like, drop loot or something.

1192
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:04,030
Wait, is that...

1193
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:07,010
Yeah, if you kill the little goblins, they drop, like, little crystals.

1194
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:10,810
Hey, guys!

1195
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,970

Oh, yeah, and, you know, I killed a bunch of kids near me.

01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,070
Oh, are you supposed to kill the kids?

No, it does.

1214
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,180
Divine light.

1215
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:09,100
Whoa!

1216
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:10,960

Okay, sound guy, now you can actually balance the game for me, for real.

01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:37,910
I also got stuck in this room going around and around.

1223
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,200
Oops.

1226
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,020
Oh, easy.

1227
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,920
You just do this.

1228
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:49,560
You pull out your buff, and then you go fire.

1229
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,840
Wait, why am I burning?

1230

Okay, let's go make Excalibur.

1235
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,820
I don't think so.

1236
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:02,540
How did I get burnt?

1237
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:03,960

Stop it.

1252
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:40,860
Stop it.

1253
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:45,900
You crying.

1254
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,500
Hi, Snuffy.

1255
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,140
Snuffy, which base are you going to?

1256
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,080
Because I'll come with you.

1257
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,080
Do we have to craft it?

1258
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:56,140
Yeah, I would think...

1259
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:56,720
Okay.

1260
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,280
Is there like a wild crafting bench you can use?

1261
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,100
You can just use our base.

1262
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,740
Just press B and teleport back.

1263
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,520
I think I'm on a different base.

1264
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,440
I will walk and escort you to my house.

1265
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:13,320
Okay.

1266
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,460
Let's go.

1267
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,320
Let's go.

1268
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,440
Maybe we'll bump into the children.

1269
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:20,980
Sorry if it's like kind of messy.

1270
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,520
We haven't cleaned up, you know.

1271
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,700
Yay

1272
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:51,000
Not punished I'm not a pyromaniac I swear Rock Okay, let me put this on here Rock soup Now put the other part on there Whoa Whoa Oh!

1273
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,620
Can I murder someone in the name of science?

1274
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,420
I know I'm an amen.

1275
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,510
Oh my god, how do I get back?

1276
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,870
Everyone's so far.

1277
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:29,030
It's not that good.

1278
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:32,450
We go this way.

1279
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:39,810
Okay, I Don't understand what did I do

1280
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,050

1281
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:09,470
Okay, so guy did the thing let me know if it's better

Yeah, I I'm here.

1283
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,430
I respond from it.

1284
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:18,770
I came to hell.

1285
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,510
Wait.

1286
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:20,590
Hello.

1287
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,630
Wait, did you drink the potion?

1288
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,230
I could hear you from all the...

1289
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:38,250
Even if I'm small, it doesn't stop me from burning people.

1290
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,030
Get over here.

1291
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:41,330

1292
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:58,970

1293
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,590

1296
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:19,350
What the fuck?

1297
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,310
She still got me on fire!

1298
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,970
I just...

1299
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:30,750
I just...

1300
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,470
I just...

1301
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:32,930
Okay, it's not at half far.

1302
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:36,250
I was really trying to grab a rock.

1303
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:38,130
I just...

1304
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:41,110
I just...

1305
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:42,230
Put two rocks together.

1306
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:43,110
Big rock.

1307
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:54,110
I got more rocks.

1308
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,090
Yeah, it's the rock suit.

1309
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,790
I got more rocks.

1310
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:02,590
They had...

1311
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,250
What's up?

1312
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:05,010
Hello?

1313
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:06,510
Hello?

1314
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,790
Yeah, that's what you sound like.

1315
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:13,610
That's when you were like...

1316
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:16,730
You were tallying about how Pokemon Sun and Moon was pretty mid.

1317
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,230
But on purple it has something similar.

1318
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:23,510
You're not free of you wanting me.

1319
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:27,430
Snuffy managed to find a spell that cost like wisps that tracked me through the entire fucking.

1320
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:31,930
And Doki found a spell that made rocks like explode and then killed herself with it.

1321
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:32,730
Yeah, I...

1322
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:35,830
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1323
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:36,870
That sounds, yeah.

1324
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:40,090
Wait, wait, no, let's go to the Goblin Village and trade rocks.

1325
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:41,450
There we go.

1326
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:43,330
Let's go to the Goblin Village.

1327
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:45,410
Wait, Lai-Mu, can I?

1328
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:46,830
Okay, can I suffer off you?

1329
01:31:48,810 --> 01:32:18,490
yeah just take my divine light afterwards oh no actually I don't want it here what oh my god what that's what it looks like I got the grass I got the thumb thrombing stone divine light wait how do I use this divine light say divine light divine light Divine light.

1330
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:20,010
Divine light.

1331
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:21,170
Oh!

1332
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:22,930
Oh!

1333
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:25,710
Blessed.

1334
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:27,590
I feel so blessed.

1335
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:31,470
I have this drumming thing, but I don't know what this does.

1336
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,050
Where do the goblins move?

1337
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,410
That's what, uh, Snuffy's been using.

1338
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,130
What does it do?

1339
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:41,610
I'm trying- Use it, use it.

1340
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:42,050
Oh wait.

1341
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:43,070
Hello?

1342
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:45,710
Hello?

1343
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,610
I used it.

1344
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:49,330
What did it do?

1345
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:50,050
I don't think it works.

1346
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:51,250
I don't think it works.

1347
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:52,890
I think it's for the rock soup.

1348
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:57,330
I think if you shrink me and I do rock soup, I just...

1349
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:58,430
I think that's what it does.

1350
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:00,450
What?

1351
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:01,390
Look at it twitching.

1352
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:02,630
You see it twitching?

1353
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:04,390
No, I think it's only on your screen.

1354
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:05,550
Wait, what if we're both tiny?

1355
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:09,050
But let me shrink you.

1356
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:13,510
What?

1357
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:32,750

1361
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:12,690
Oh my god, I'm so far.

1362
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:15,690
Where do the goblins live?

1363
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:17,310
Where are the trades?

1364
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:23,510
I don't know where the goblin village is.

1365
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:26,530
Where the fuck is the goblin village?

1366
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:28,350
Okay, I'm gonna claim this real quick though.

1367
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:32,770

Follow the sound of the children.

You're...

1372
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,440
The children luring me into the magical forest.

1373
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,600
Apparently it's like all the bottom.

1374
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,400
I think it's the bottom one.

1375
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:24,580
That's where the...

1376
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:26,000
That's the goblin village.

1377
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,120
I think.

1378
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,200
Let's go find them.

1379
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:28,960

1383
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,820
Guys, Min's been stuck in the swamp.

1384
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:08,120
She's being quicksand.

1385
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:13,760
Slon live.

1386
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,300
The king.

1387
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,120
I'm not regaining stamina.

1388
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,120
I think maybe here.

1389
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:25,940
Right here.

1390
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,600
If you get out here, there's a slope here.

1391
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:28,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1392
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,360
Okay, let me try that.

1393
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:31,740
Are you sinking?

1394
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:35,720
Wait, there's the frog right there.

1395
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:36,640
There we go.

1396
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:39,700
Oh, wait.

1397
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:40,400
Guys.

1398
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:42,240
Oh, no.

1399
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,240
Guys, now I'm stuck.

1400
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,840
Wait, wait a minute.

1401
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:46,880
Wait a minute.

1402
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,200
Wait a minute.

1403
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:50,320
Oh, I got...

1404
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:50,940
I did it.

1405
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,980
Oh, the frog disappeared.

1406
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,700
You gotta find a frog so we can...

1407
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:58,500
Divine Light.

1408
01:37:59,580 --> 01:37:59,940
Yay!

1409
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:01,780
Oh!

1410
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,760
I hear one.

1411
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,660
Yeah, we're killing a frog.

1412
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,220
Oh shoot.

1413
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:08,060
Oh shoot.

1414
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,620
Oh, she didn't make it.

1415
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,720
It's been unforgiving, isn't it?

1416
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:11,460
Yeah.

1417
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,240
And it dropped a toad.

1418
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:17,160
Yeah, yeah, we need that for crafting.

1419
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,580
I can't even get around.

1420
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,260
There's a slope behind you.

1421
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,120
You can bring it back up there.

1422
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:23,880
I got rock.

1423
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:26,280

Hello?

1432
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,420
I think you gotta parkour it.

1433
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:17,480
Wait, where are you?

1434
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,960
Or are you guys going to the lava island?

1435
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,840
Yeah, I think this is the last one I can explore.

1436
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:25,160
Oh, watch out.

1437
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,800
Other than the gob...

1438
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,800
I think we have to reset the map to get goblin island.

1439
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:31,780
Oh, why am I...

1440
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,820
Why am I slipping?

1441
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,140
Oh, why am I slipping?

1442
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,200
Oh, why am I...

1443
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,120
You have parkour.

1444
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,600
Oh, it's a evil mage.

1445
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:41,620
Oh, shit.

1446
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,940
She's evil.

1447
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,800
There's so many...

1448
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:51,760
Wait, where's your smite?

1449
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:52,660
Just smite them.

1450
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:53,600
Smite them.

1451
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:55,420
Fireball.

1452
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:57,460
Oh.

1453
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:58,840
Fireball.

1454
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,780
I think Mint's dead.

1455
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,760
Yeah, she did.

1456
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:05,860
Oh, she gave you the smite sword.

1457
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:06,940
That's why.

1458
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,960
Oh, that makes a lot more sense.

1459
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,260
Why did she die?

1460
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:17,300
There's gotta be something cool here if they were protecting it, right?

1461
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:17,920
Yeah.

1462
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:22,850
Divine light.

1463
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:28,130
Wait, where?

1464
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:30,250
Where are you?

1465
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:31,530

1466
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:33,830
Wait, where are you, lad?

1467
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:36,550
I went up a spiral staircase.

1468
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,610
Oh, what the spell did you get?

1469
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:42,370
Do you want to do something?

1470
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,090
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1471
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:51,350

1472
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:52,170
You can't burn it.

1473
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:53,070
Ah, that's me!

1474
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:02,110
Divine light.

1475
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,550
She killed me.

1476
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,550
Why?

1477
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,850
Why did she kill me?

1478
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:13,490
Oh, my God.

1479
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:18,510

Yeah, that's all I was trying to do.

1598
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:18,790
Yeah.

1599
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:26,260
Wait, what does this do?

1600
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,400
Wait, I can levitate?

1601
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:30,240
Oh, yeah, you can lift people with it.

1602
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,260
Mint and I did that first round, so she was just holding people still and I was hitting them.

1603
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:37,240
Oh, that's what this does.

1604
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:44,350
Thunderbolt.

1605
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:54,550
Put me in the fucking lava, bitch.

1606
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:08,510
I didn't actually do it.

1607
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:14,850
I didn't actually do it.

1608
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:21,690
That's what I'm assuming that I was going to put you in the lava.

1609
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:23,890
Oh yeah, you'd never do that.

1610
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:26,250
It was just a silly joke.

1611
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:30,070
It was just a hee-he-haha.

1612
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:31,950
I can't believe you in it.

1613
01:52:31,970 --> 01:52:35,570
I assumed such a thing that I would do.

1614
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:37,130
I don't know.

1615
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:41,590
I think that's pretty messed up that you instantly think I was going to do that to you.

1616
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:46,130
It definitely was not rooted in prior experiences and I should have had more faith.

1617
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:46,990
Exactly.

1618
01:52:47,790 --> 01:52:48,810
Wait, so what does this do?

1619
01:52:50,190 --> 01:52:50,890
We're all going to stick.

1620
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:52,550
Don't you do it.

1621
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:54,510
What does it do?

1622
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:54,990
Oh, God.

1623
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:57,570
You stab with it.

1624
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:58,930
Wait, really?

1625
01:52:59,470 --> 01:52:59,890
Oops.

1626
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:11,190
I just assume I steal her shit!

1627
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:12,110
Okay,

1628
01:53:15,450 --> 01:53:15,470
wait.

1629
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:19,310
I'm just gonna go super saiyan real quick.

1630
01:53:21,130 --> 01:53:26,570
So I think actually what it does is it sucks things out of people's hands because I dropped the sword when we did that.

1631
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:27,010
Wait, did I?

1632
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:27,550
Really?

1633
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:29,090
Wait, how does that work?

1634
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:30,810
Wait, can I try?

1635
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:35,670
yeah oh it's like the soup

1636
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:47,400

1637
01:53:55,120 --> 01:54:07,380

Oh, well.

1640
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:12,920
Oh, no.

1641
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:14,820
She knows exactly where I am.

1642
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,060
She's chasing me.

1643
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,920
She knows exactly where I'm going.

1644
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:23,580
She's right behind me, doesn't she?

1645
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:26,300
Can't catch me.

1646
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,600
I just keep, I'm in the mushroom.

1647
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:33,220
She can't get me.

1648
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:34,840
Fireball.

1649
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:35,980
Oh, shit.

1650
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:36,220

Wait, what happened?

01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:49,850
No.

1659
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:53,970
It's okay.

1660
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:56,950
Now no one can get hurt anymore.

1661
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:00,790
Now no one will ever get hurt.

1662
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:12,520
Wait, which tower did I go through this one?

1663
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:16,840
Wait, maybe I I just went the wrong tower.

1664
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,120
You're right.

1665
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:22,340

1671
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:56,240
I knew you were here!

1672
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:00,690
I saw you on the map!

Magic missile.

I'll jump!

1677
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:08,030
I'll do it!

1678
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:09,310
Okay.

1679
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:12,010
You'll never get the sword!

1680
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:15,330
Fireball.

1681
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:17,370
If I died, I'm going to swamp!

1682
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:17,990

01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:27,170
She won't find my body.

1685
01:58:28,690 --> 01:58:31,090
Maybe she won't find my body.

1686
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:33,190
Maybe she won't.

1687
01:58:35,110 --> 01:58:35,590
Fireball.

1688
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:40,170
She'll never find my body.

1689
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:42,970
She'll never know.

1690
01:58:45,450 --> 01:58:47,510
What do you mean we'll never know?

1691
01:58:48,230 --> 01:58:49,410
Wait, where are you guys?

1692

01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:55,350
Wait, give me a second.

1695
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:56,550
I'm trying to get the sword back.

1696
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:58,170
We'll be right back.

1697
01:58:58,850 --> 01:58:59,810
What do you mean the sword?

1698
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:01,490
I'm trying to get the sword back.

1699
01:59:01,610 --> 01:59:03,210
I don't think she knows where I died.

1700
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:10,150
Guys did she get the sword?

1701
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:13,290
Oh.

1702
01:59:14,190 --> 01:59:15,150

01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:15,970
Wait, I'm here.

1704
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:17,210
What is that?

1705
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:20,650
Let me use it on you.

1706
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:21,470
Wait, what is that?

1707
01:59:21,510 --> 01:59:22,810
What did you do?

1708
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:28,830
That does...

1709
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:30,670
I know what that does.

1710
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:32,770
I know what that does.

1711
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:33,910
You fucking...

1712
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:36,350
That's

1713
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:41,910
how I got the sword the first time.

1714
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:46,900
That's when you get back here.

1715
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:48,120
Get back here.

1716
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:50,340
Are you bullying Mint again?

1717
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,580
No, I'm not!

1718
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,600
She's bullying me!

1719
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:55,860
She was...

1720
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,320
She was fucking...

1721
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:57,780
Where'd she drop it?

1722
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:58,760
Where'd she drop it?

1723
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:00,700
I don't know where it is.

1724
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:02,840
Oh, that's a tree.

1725
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:05,320
Wait, what the fuck?

1726
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:07,100
Wait, what is that?

1727
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,460
Wait, can I try that?

1728
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:11,400
Wait, can't I try that?

1729
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:12,760
It's so cool.

1730
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,000
Why am I purple?

1731
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,560
Oh, I'm backwards.

1732
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:16,280
Why am I backwards?

1733
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:16,900
I hate that.

1734
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:21,340
I see.

1735
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:24,400
That's why you were purple.

1736
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,680
No, she spit the thing at us.

1737
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,580
She spit the thing at us.

1738
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:30,900
No, she started it.

1739
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:32,400
She started it.

1740
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:32,720
I swear.

1741
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:34,200
I swear.

1742
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,220
She started it.

1743
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:39,500
What the fuck is it on me?

1744
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:40,260
I swear!

1745
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:43,860
I swear to God!

1746
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:48,360
A wizard should know to trust his stares rather than steal.

1747
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:50,000
She- she's shot!

1748
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,140
She's shot it!

1749
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:52,680
And she said it!

1750
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:53,780
I swear to God!

1751
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:54,940
No!

1752
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:55,860
Wait!

1753
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:56,700
Ah!

1754
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:57,840
It was self-defense!

1755
02:00:58,340 --> 02:00:59,740
It was self-defense!

1756
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:06,530
It was self-defense!

1757
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:07,750
I swear to God!

1758
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:11,810
I was just defending myself.

1759
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:15,030
At least let me have a balloon and fly.

1760
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:16,910
What happened?

1761
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:20,010
Wee.

1762
02:01:34,570 --> 02:01:35,330
Where

1763
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:43,670
am I going?

1764
02:01:44,410 --> 02:01:45,070
Fireball.

1765
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:51,210
If I keep dying up, nobody can hurt me.

1766
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:55,290
Fireball Oh my god

02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:13,530

The antire.

1771
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:32,090
What the fuck was that antire?

1772
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:37,180
Wait, how the hell is this way?

1773
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:42,550

Okay, okay.

1820
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,180
But before I re-roll it.

1821
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:16,080
Oh, they just explode.

1822
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:20,680
Oh, the children explode after they give you stuff.

1823
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:21,960
Yeah.

1824
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:24,080
Yeah, you've been killing them.

1825
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:25,020
But they're useful.

1826
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:29,420
No, yeah, but when you kill them, they still drop the stuff regardless.

1827
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:32,040
Look at my chat.

1828
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:33,180
So you watch this.

1829
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:35,760
Wait, what?

02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:42,900
Oh my god.

1833
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:52,280
I'm resetting the map.

1834
02:06:56,980 --> 02:06:58,820
The new lobby.

1835
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:08,160
I made the new lobby.

1836
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,860
Alright, large.

1837
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,340
We did it.

1838
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,620
This is why.

1839
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:20,040
What did I do?

1840
02:07:20,860 --> 02:07:22,720
What did I do?

1841
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,480
I don't know what I did wrong.

1842
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:27,700
I don't know.

1843
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:29,880
I don't understand.

1844
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:31,620
What did I do wrong?

1845
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:41,740
I don't understand.

1846
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:45,300
I thought I was a good person.

1847
02:07:47,580 --> 02:07:50,300
I thought I was a good person throughout that run.

1848
02:07:54,450 --> 02:07:56,150
There's a magic mirror on the wall?

1849
02:07:56,690 --> 02:07:58,450
Mirror mirror on the wall.

1850
02:08:00,850 --> 02:08:01,190

02:08:02,410 --> 02:08:03,290
What's this?

1852
02:08:05,550 --> 02:08:07,250
Wait, what is she trying to draw?

1853
02:08:10,190 --> 02:08:11,510
I can't tell.

1854
02:08:12,110 --> 02:08:13,470
Is that supposed to be me?

1855
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:16,230
Is that Homer Simpson?

1856
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:18,610
Homer?

1857
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:23,430

That's, those are the nipples.

1862
02:09:16,590 --> 02:09:26,830
Why did she color the nipples?

1863
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:30,950
All right, we're good to go.

1864
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:37,170
Why did you color the nipples?

1865

Let's go.

1911
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:17,420

Fireball.

1914
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:29,890
Fireball.

1915
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:32,230
The trails of little fire sparks.

1916
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:33,010
Oh my god, no.

1917
02:13:33,310 --> 02:13:34,170
Everybody be nice.

1918
02:13:34,430 --> 02:13:34,730
I did it.

1919
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:35,370
I did it.

1920
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:37,330
I'm trying to get our thing back.

1921
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:40,190
I'm trying to claim our lands back.

1922
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:40,830
Fireball.

1923
02:13:44,210 --> 02:13:44,850
Oh shit!

1924
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:50,450
The evil chick bug cloud.

1925
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:51,350
So much violence so quickly.

1926
02:13:52,210 --> 02:13:52,530
Yeah.

1927
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:56,110
All right, I'll make the new lobby.

1928
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:58,650
Okay.

1929
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:13,220
Wait, does the village spawn in large or medium?

1930
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:14,560
Or only medium?

1931
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:18,700
Guys, do villages spawn in medium in large maps?

1932
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:21,540
Because I know the village showed up in medium.

1933
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:36,590
I only put large because I wanted to have like a more likely chance to spawn in.

1934
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:41,430
Yeah, but you know, there's a forest spawn in the- okay, I'm gonna do large.

1935
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:46,610
All right, I'll do large just in case.

1936
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:58,430
Okay, we were figuring this out.

1937
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:00,390
Okay.

1938
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:08,680
All right, what is Snuffy trying to draw this time?

1939
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:11,380
What is this?

1940
02:15:19,130 --> 02:15:21,230
I don't know what she's trying to draw.

1941
02:15:22,450 --> 02:15:24,410
Oh, it's a pony!

1942
02:15:34,010 --> 02:15:36,830
And then the cutie mark is...

1943
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:40,730
It's a...

1944
02:15:40,730 --> 02:15:43,830
The cutie mark is basically...

1945
02:15:59,870 --> 02:16:00,630
Um...

1946
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:01,750
That's the cutie mark.

1947
02:16:06,190 --> 02:16:07,850
I'm gonna give her a torch!

1948
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:25,050
It's like my beautiful face and our beautiful flag.

1949
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:28,210
Do nothing but live my life.

1950
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:31,010
It's called.

1951
02:16:31,310 --> 02:16:31,810
I got an orb.

1952
02:16:32,370 --> 02:16:32,890
Wait, what's that?

1953
02:16:33,350 --> 02:16:34,250
Ponder the orb.

1954
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:35,570
Wait, what does the orb do?

1955
02:16:38,010 --> 02:16:38,570
Wait, the forest!

1956
02:16:38,810 --> 02:16:40,230
See through the eyes of the enemy.

1957
02:16:40,770 --> 02:16:41,250
Wait, what?

1958
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:42,650
Oh, so you know where they are.

1959
02:16:43,650 --> 02:16:44,650
Yeah, here, wait, look at it.

1960
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:45,170
Look at it.

1961
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:46,650
Wait, okay, wait.

1962
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:47,210
Give me a sec.

1963
02:16:47,430 --> 02:16:47,750
All right.

1964
02:16:48,030 --> 02:16:49,390
Oh, look at it.

1965
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:52,830
Oh!

1966
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:54,770
Oh, they're looking at their spells.

1967
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:57,450
They're outside their house right now.

1968
02:16:58,830 --> 02:17:01,430
Okay, we should journey and see if we can find the goblin camp.

1969
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:02,050
Alright.

1970
02:17:02,690 --> 02:17:03,570
I think the goblin camp...

1971
02:17:03,570 --> 02:17:05,970
Wait, we have to grab items to trade with the goblins.

1972
02:17:06,810 --> 02:17:07,530
Oh, true, right?

1973
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:09,490
I got some items in my hand.

1974
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:12,610
I think the goblin camp is in the middle.

1975
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:14,790
Okay.

1976
02:17:15,630 --> 02:17:16,010
Okay.

1977
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:21,050
Oh, frogs.

1978
02:17:21,230 --> 02:17:23,750
Oh, I think the... Wait, what the fuck?

1979
02:17:23,790 --> 02:17:25,030
Oh, they're crafting right now.

1980
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:32,450
Okay, I feel like it's a sit- should we go through the swabs then?

1981
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:34,090
We just go on the edges.

1982
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:37,050
Yeah, the edges of the swap.

1983
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:37,350
Oh.

1984
02:17:39,090 --> 02:17:39,650
Okay.

1985
02:17:41,490 --> 02:17:43,090
Duffy's fucking wild.

1986
02:17:44,470 --> 02:17:46,190
She's wild for that.

1987
02:17:50,510 --> 02:17:52,230
Wait, that has to be the forest.

1988
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:53,770
Oh, here, here.

1989
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:54,910
I found it.

1990
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:55,670
Here they are.

1991
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:56,430

02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:12,210
Last time I accidentally gave him my book.

1997
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:13,690
He traded your book for one crystal.

1998

Congratulations.

1999
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:15,810

02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:08,880
I don't like the blink one.

2015
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:10,160
I'm trading that.

2016
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:12,740
Wait, you got a blink one?

Wait, he traded me the blink spell back.

2019
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:20,160
They don't like re-gifting, bro.

2020
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:22,260
I got weed of the pipe.

2021
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:23,080
Leave me alone.

2022
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:23,820

Divine light.

2028
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:36,280
Why does the game hate you so much?

2029
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:44,160
What does Divine light do?

2030
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:45,180
It heals.

2031
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:47,660

Sorry, I thought you were joking.

2034
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:53,060
I tried to blow her up with the laser beam.

2035
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:55,600

Whisp.

2095
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:17,300
Rock.

2096

2097
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:21,980

2098
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:22,280

2099
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:22,780

2100
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:24,020

02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:32,460
It's like whip cream.

2107
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:32,920
Whisp.

2108
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:34,140
Whisp.

2109

2110
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:36,620

Whisp.

2114
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:40,960
Oh, oh, you have to do it fast.

2115
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:43,500
What the fuck does this spell even do?

2116
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:44,960
I don't know.

2117
02:24:44,980 --> 02:24:47,160
It's like a very small amount of damage to your enemies or something.

2118
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:48,580
Divine Light.

2119
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:50,820
Maybe if you're trying to find someone.

2120
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:52,700
Rock.

2121
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:55,400

Divine light.

2126
02:24:59,540 --> 02:25:00,300
I tried to snipe off.

2127
02:25:02,300 --> 02:25:02,700
Whisp.

2128
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:08,440
Oh, it slows you down a little too.

2129
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:10,920
Handing spells gives me such power.

2130
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:11,800
I really do think.

2131
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:12,980
Yeah.

2132
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:16,620
I think my favorite is Biden Blast.

2133
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:18,520
Oh my god, no.

2134
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:21,860
Wait, can I try the Biden Blast?

2135
02:25:23,060 --> 02:25:25,820
I haven't done it in real life, but I remember when I was a kid.

2136
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:27,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to try Biden Blast.

2137
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:28,280
Come on in Dragon Ball.

2138
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:34,180

02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:05,360
divine light oh divine light yay I don't know what that does other than make me feel good.

2141
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:05,720
Okay.

2142
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:11,180
I, I didn't know it one shots because when you use it on people, they didn't die.

2143
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:13,620
They definitely died.

2144
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:15,800
No, they didn't die instantly.

2145
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:17,020
They didn't die instantly.

2146
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:22,700
I thought I thought it would have been, I thought it was like a two shot.

2147
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:26,280
I thought it was a two shot.

2148
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:28,540
I swear to God, I thought it was a two shot.

2149
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:31,220
We got, we got to get rid of the evidence.

2150
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:31,880
We got to get rid of the evidence.

2151
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:33,000
Gotta get rid of the evidence.

2152
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:33,840
No, we gotta.

2153
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:35,100
We gotta get rid of it.

2154
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:36,000
Other things are...

2155
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,760
Our words with blast in it.

2156
02:26:40,260 --> 02:26:41,240
Come blast.

2157
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:44,440
Fireball.

2158
02:26:45,060 --> 02:26:45,140
Oh!

2159
02:26:45,860 --> 02:26:46,800
The firelight!

2160
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:48,380
The firelight!

2161
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,740
The firelight!

2162
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:52,520
The firelight!

2163
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:53,960
The firelight!

2164
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:55,080
The firelight!

2165
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:55,820
No!

2166
02:26:57,780 --> 02:26:58,540
Very good.

2167
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:04,380
Wait, I want my stuff back.

2168
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:09,600
Oh my god.

2169
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:11,820
Oh my god.

2170
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:14,080
I can't believe they synced it.

2171
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:15,660
Oh, that was crazy.

2172
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:18,760
Oh, Shepar, I was in the swallow area.

2173
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:24,960
I can't believe they synced that up.

2174
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:29,600
We were trying to get rid of the evidence.

2175
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:32,420
God.

2176
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,040
I can't believe.

2177
02:27:34,580 --> 02:27:35,260
Oh my god.

2178
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,160
When you're panicking, it doesn't work.

2179
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:38,360
Okay, I need to press B.

2180
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:40,980
I can't get out of the swamp.

2181
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,440
It's too, gosh darn dark.

2182
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:50,500
Oh, I don't have my torch anymore because I traded it away.

2183
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:55,620
That's crazy that that's how it works.

2184
02:28:00,170 --> 02:28:03,050
The village is in front of me?

2185
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:06,530
Yeah.

2186
02:28:09,190 --> 02:28:10,150
Hi, Ducky.

2187
02:28:10,910 --> 02:28:10,990
Hey.

2188
02:28:12,330 --> 02:28:14,290
I didn't know.

2189
02:28:14,510 --> 02:28:16,910
I didn't know it would one shot.

2190
02:28:17,210 --> 02:28:18,030
I swear to God.

2191
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:19,510
I swear to God.

2192
02:28:19,930 --> 02:28:20,570
I didn't know.

2193
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:25,850
Snuffy and now we try to recover you guys.

2194
02:28:27,790 --> 02:28:28,330
We're Snuffy.

2195
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:31,050
Wait, did Snuffy die in this in the trees?

2196
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:32,450
I don't know.

2197
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:33,790
She's over there.

2198
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:37,350
She's in the mushroom kingdom.

2199
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:41,590
Snuffy?

2200
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:44,870
Oh, Snuffy TP'd back.

2201
02:28:44,890 --> 02:28:46,030
I thought the nobes don't come back.

2202
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:46,850
That's kind of fucked.

2203
02:28:47,350 --> 02:28:49,270
Wait, where did Mint go?

2204
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:55,230
Mint got your orb and decided to go and see if she could do things with it.

2205
02:28:55,630 --> 02:28:57,090
Oh, it was just a pondering orb.

2206
02:28:57,310 --> 02:28:58,090
Like, literally just...

2207
02:28:58,090 --> 02:29:01,910
You could see whatever where, like, the other eyes are, like, looking at.

2208
02:29:02,970 --> 02:29:04,030
Oh, that's cool.

2209
02:29:04,270 --> 02:29:05,830
Yeah, it was just a pondering orb.

2210
02:29:06,210 --> 02:29:07,490
I don't have a...

2211
02:29:07,510 --> 02:29:11,530
torch anymore because I traded it to the goblins and then we killed all of them.

2212
02:29:11,890 --> 02:29:14,510
So, um, I don't think I'm getting a torch back.

2213
02:29:15,830 --> 02:29:16,170
Oh.

2214
02:29:17,350 --> 02:29:18,170
Hey, I hear somebody.

2215
02:29:19,410 --> 02:29:19,730
Snuffy?

2216
02:29:22,190 --> 02:29:23,030
Oh, Mint?

2217
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:24,210
Wait, they're back, you guys.

2218
02:29:24,390 --> 02:29:25,110
You lied to me.

2219
02:29:25,730 --> 02:29:26,250
Wait, that was my boy.

2220
02:29:26,250 --> 02:29:26,610
What's that?

2221
02:29:29,230 --> 02:29:30,790
Oh, they did come back.

2222
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,290
They're here.

2223
02:29:31,450 --> 02:29:31,910
Oh, they did!

2224
02:29:32,190 --> 02:29:32,470
Nice.

2225
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:35,890
Dark Blast.

2226
02:29:36,570 --> 02:29:37,030
Dark Blast.

2227
02:29:37,630 --> 02:29:39,230
Oh my god, you killed!

2228
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:42,740
You killed the guy!

2229
02:29:43,260 --> 02:29:44,420
What did he do to you?

2230
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:49,160
Doki doesn't even want to trade anymore because you killed his friend!

2231
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:52,080
Wait, Doki, did you ponder the orb?

2232
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:53,380
Yeah, I pondered the orb.

2233
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:55,500
You can basically like stream snipe the enemy.

2234
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:57,420
Yeah, it's crazy!

2235
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:58,020
Yeah.

2236
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:02,340
I mean, I could just pull up your stream instead, but like, yeah, it's pretty...

2237
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:05,380
Well, I mean, that takes a lot of effort, actually.

2238
02:30:05,860 --> 02:30:06,340
This.

2239
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:10,700
What did you do?

2240
02:30:12,140 --> 02:30:12,820
That was the whisp.

2241
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:13,760
Oh, that was the whisp.

2242
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:14,500
Whisp.

2243
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:15,300
Whisp.

2244
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:16,540
Whisp.

2245
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:19,060
Do we want to call it here?

2246
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:20,060
Wait.

2247
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:21,160
Give me a sec.

2248
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:22,760
I want to do one last trade.

2249
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:25,200
One last spell trade.

2250
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:27,560
One last spell trade.

2251
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:30,760
They won't give me anything but damn frogs.

2252
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:32,420
They just give me like mushrooms.

2253
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:34,840
I wish we did not kill the majority of these people.

2254
02:30:37,420 --> 02:30:38,780
I didn't blast.

2255
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:53,960
Oh my god, where am I?

2256
02:30:58,470 --> 02:31:00,190
Oh my god.

2257
02:31:00,850 --> 02:31:01,050
Okay, wait.

2258
02:31:02,210 --> 02:31:03,250
I have to go back here.

2259
02:31:04,510 --> 02:31:05,130
This way.

2260
02:31:06,550 --> 02:31:06,970
See?

2261
02:31:07,270 --> 02:31:10,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2262
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:15,590

2263
02:31:15,670 --> 02:31:15,930

02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:23,160

2268
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:24,700
Right here.

2269
02:32:25,480 --> 02:32:25,700
Yeah.

2270
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:25,840
Okay.

2271
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:26,020
Okay.

2272
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:26,560
New idea.

2273
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:33,740
We should be like a skewer, two dark blasts on the end simultaneous just like, oh my god, wait, that's, that's a good one.

2274
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:34,420
The skewers.

2275
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:35,220
Wait, what?

2276
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:37,180
The Biden blast skewers.

2277
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:38,020
I have one.

2278
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:47,880
And then it's a Biden blast skewer.

2279
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:50,100
Yeah, that's fine.

2280
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:52,720
Apparently you say come blast, it also works too.

2281
02:32:54,340 --> 02:32:55,300
What works?

2282
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:58,280
Yeah, stuffy tested that up.

2283
02:32:58,340 --> 02:32:59,060
Or like brain blast?

2284
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:01,360
It's gotta reload.

2285
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:02,620
Okay.

2286
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:04,420
I'll count us down when you say you're ready.

2287
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:05,140
I'm ready.

2288
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:06,520
I'm ready.

2289
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:07,740
On one.

2290
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:09,820
Three, two, one.

2291
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:11,280
Biden blast.

2292
02:33:23,810 --> 02:33:25,250
Holy shit.

2293
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:26,750
Oh, hey.

2294
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:29,350
We got blasted.

2295
02:33:30,950 --> 02:33:34,390
That was so good, dude.

2296
02:33:34,670 --> 02:33:37,750
We just flipping Biden blasted.

2297
02:33:37,850 --> 02:33:40,410
We all just evaporated into the air.

2298
02:33:41,030 --> 02:33:43,030
Wow, what a way to go.

2299
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:44,810
Can we drown?

2300
02:33:45,710 --> 02:33:50,250
I know, I feel like- I'm thinking we're playing it more competitively.

2301
02:33:51,350 --> 02:33:51,850
You can.

2302
02:33:52,090 --> 02:33:53,570
I'm returning to the sea, goodbye.

2303
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:54,610
Alright.

2304
02:33:57,130 --> 02:33:59,010
Wait, you can die from the ocean?

2305
02:34:01,050 --> 02:34:02,490
My people need me.

2306
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:06,850
Wait, I think we're dead, dead for- oh, wait, no.

2307
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:08,450
Alright.

2308

What do you mean, shore?

2315
02:34:51,190 --> 02:34:51,910
We're just Vikings.

Yeah, we have a Viking funeral.

2317
02:34:56,430 --> 02:34:57,950
There's cotton there.

2318
02:34:59,130 --> 02:35:00,010
That was fun.

2319
02:35:00,210 --> 02:35:01,570
That was fun exploring everything.

2320
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:04,110
That was really, really fun.

2321
02:35:04,290 --> 02:35:05,510
Thank you for inviting me.

2322
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:07,590

2323
02:35:07,610 --> 02:35:08,690
I hope it updates more.

2324
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:09,190
Yeah.

2325
02:35:09,410 --> 02:35:09,930
Listen, shit.

2326
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:10,630
Yeah.

2327
02:35:11,030 --> 02:35:42,170
emotes i want emotes oh yeah emotes more spells yeah more spells would be really cool yeah i saw that it was developed by one guy oh really yeah like um a horse a broomstick a spell drive by you just wrote right up on your horse and just go fireball and then ride away you could do that with the frog balloon Oh my god.

2328
02:35:42,470 --> 02:35:43,390
That's so true.

2329
02:35:43,710 --> 02:35:44,170
Just fine.

2330
02:35:44,510 --> 02:35:45,470
Okay, that was okay.

2331
02:35:45,650 --> 02:35:52,170
The anti-air shit of all three of you guys were shooting fireballs and freezes at me in the sky.

2332
02:35:52,770 --> 02:35:53,990
That shit was crazy.

2333
02:35:55,170 --> 02:36:00,970
I saw you guys in the distance and I thought you were like just having fun and like trying to like like in my eyes when I saw you.

2334
02:36:01,490 --> 02:36:04,750
I saw Goki like flying in the air and you guys shooting off fireballs.

2335
02:36:04,890 --> 02:36:07,490
I was like, oh my god, look, they're trying to shoot off fireworks for Doki.

2336
02:36:07,810 --> 02:36:08,490
Oh my god.

2337
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:10,910
And then I get closer and they're just like dying.

2338
02:36:12,490 --> 02:36:16,270
And then he said, he joined in and was like, freeze.

2339
02:36:16,910 --> 02:36:17,610
And I was like, what?

2340
02:36:21,370 --> 02:36:29,390
I think that was the funniest thing about that game is that sometimes it felt like more of a mafia game where two wizards just turned the corner like, fireball.

2341
02:36:29,650 --> 02:36:31,150
Like you didn't hear them coming up behind you.

2342
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:34,630
Especially now we're like trying to turn around.

2343
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:37,090
We were trying to get rid of the evidence.

2344
02:36:37,430 --> 02:36:40,710
And then you and like Limo and Mitt were like, fireball.

2345
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:42,370
Fireball.

2346
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:44,030
Yeah, it's so good, dude.

2347
02:36:45,810 --> 02:36:49,110
Like, because you feel like it's so monotone, it's like execution style.

2348
02:36:49,470 --> 02:36:49,750
I know.

2349
02:36:50,550 --> 02:36:52,130
Did you guys plan that?

2350
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:55,630
It kind of felt like a paintball game.

2351
02:36:55,730 --> 02:36:58,170
Like, that's got to feel like what it was like playing paintball.

2352
02:36:58,530 --> 02:36:58,890
Yeah.

2353
02:37:00,210 --> 02:37:03,030
Yeah, it's like we got, there was a hit on us there.

2354
02:37:05,250 --> 02:37:07,650
I'm surprised I can't hear you guys' like footsteps.

2355
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:09,170
So we didn't have a Disney suddenly.

2356
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:09,690
Right.

2357
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:45,960
approach yeah you guys are late least sneak attack goodbye snuffy and doki you're gonna sleep with the fishes tonight are you kidding me it might have just done doki v everybody we're live who had six kills on us oh yeah like i don't understand like it was like we have no british support i feel like there was no like american support like yeah it could not really that way like you know like a that fucking game is to have an American-British hybrid accent.

2358
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:47,140
That's the key.

2359
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:48,480
Yeah, like every time.

2360
02:37:48,700 --> 02:37:49,340
It's the most wizard tone.

2361
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:52,140
Every word you say, the game registers.

2362
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:56,080
And then it took Min and I's like five times to say one thing.

2363
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,700
I liked my fireball.

2364
02:37:58,800 --> 02:37:59,440
I don't know why.

2365
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:02,240
Yeah, I would be like fireball and it would just be like...

2366
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:06,080
And I would be like fireball and then she shoots like seven fireballs at us.

2367
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:09,000
Go back to Hogwarts, idiot.

2368
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:11,460
Love you, son.

2369
02:38:13,180 --> 02:38:16,180
You got to repeat your first year.

2370
02:38:16,420 --> 02:38:18,700
I think I know who's the hufflepuff here.

2371
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:23,660
Rip any English learners trying to play this game.

2372
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:29,460
Next time I am going to practice on British English.

2373
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:31,060
Aluminum.

2374
02:38:31,580 --> 02:38:32,280
Aluminum.

2375
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:33,650
Aluminum.

2376
02:38:35,320 --> 02:38:36,020
Aluminum.

2377
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:36,200
Yes.

2378
02:38:36,820 --> 02:38:37,520
Aluminum.

2379
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:43,140
You're going to be out here going 40 water bottles in my aluminium.

2380
02:38:43,160 --> 02:39:10,380
cup oh approximately 30 degrees celsius i swear to god no thank you the warmest water it's a hot day outside i don't know i swear to god i wonder if the game would register my voice more if i put it on indian mode if i i think i think another streamer had to do that so maybe oh my like different languages and stuff?

2381
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:13,760
You have like an accent.

2382
02:39:14,020 --> 02:39:18,000
You could change the game to like Indian English.

2383
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:18,680
Oh.

2384
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:19,720
Indian accent.

2385
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:21,560
That's kind of cool.

2386
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:23,740
I feel like I have an accent though.

2387
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:24,560
Yeah.

2388
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:28,960
You guys don't really like strike me as people with like, I mean, we all have different ways of speaking.

2389
02:39:29,220 --> 02:39:30,080
But I didn't recognize it.

2390
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:30,940
Accent.

2391
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:38,080
I think it was just weird because even me for Fireball, I have like people say I have a Midwestern accent.

2392
02:39:38,620 --> 02:40:04,820
be like america what's a midwestern accent a child would probably say so they'll be like oh yeah i can hear that from snuffy and i'll just stand there like what does that mean what does that mean what does midwestern accent wait they say oh what ah midwestern no i don't i have no idea oh oh the midwestern

2393
02:40:08,620 --> 02:40:10,960
I know Vinny's played Lifeline, but has Doki yet?

2394
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:12,440
Doki, have you played Lifeline yet?

2395
02:40:12,620 --> 02:40:13,300
Oh, my God.

2396
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:13,800
No.

2397
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,140
Doki, you need to play Lifeline.

2398
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:17,920
You need to play Lifeline.

2399
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:19,320
You need to play Lifeline.

2400
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:20,360
Lifeline.

2401
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:22,100
I was like, Lifeline from Apex?

2402
02:40:22,580 --> 02:40:23,720
Like, no.

2403
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:25,700
Yeah.

2404
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:27,760
Yeah, I've been like, you have voice from Apex Legends.

2405
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:34,780
It's like, it's a voice-controlled PS2 game, and that game will make you doubt the way that you say any words ever in the English language.

2406
02:40:34,840 --> 02:40:37,820
It will just make you feel like you're just speaking a completely different language.

2407
02:40:38,800 --> 02:41:39,160
I did that with hey you Pikachu and Pikachu made me feel like I was schizophrenic like oh wait I tried to play that fish game what was it the where you raise a human fish face guy what oh yeah oh my god yeah I've seen that yeah and like it did not work I did not I for some reason I could not get the microphone to work and then I just raised all the fish and then I just let all the fishes die in the tank no yeah that was sea man I think that's like a really yeah it was seamen yeah yeah i was trying to like get them to talk to me but they like they refused to like like acknowledge me and then i was like fine i'll just starve all of you to death i'm gonna post a picture you guys might have seen this this is seamen 1999 it's a game oh i know fish people how beautiful can you talk to them yeah and he grows into a he grows into a fucking lizard Ew,

I would be so rude to him.

2409
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:44,600
Not the lizard.

2410
02:41:45,580 --> 02:41:46,580
I mean, he's pretty ugly.

2411
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:47,740
A freak.

2412
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:49,960
Yeah, he is a freak.

2413
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:51,880
What if that's the Depp's face?

2414
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,020
Somebody said they poop out of their dangler.

2415
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:56,440
Oh, and what?

02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:57,500
Oh, did you see that?

2417
02:41:57,540 --> 02:41:58,460
What's a dangler?

2418
02:41:58,740 --> 02:42:00,060
Did you see, like, how they mate?

2419
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:04,700
Wait, the human fish?

2422
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:45,400
I'm gonna give the link to you guys.

2423
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:46,240
You can watch it.

2424

There we go.

2425
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:47,700

02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:49,420
Thanks, J-Dog.

2427
02:42:49,540 --> 02:42:51,080
It's more like a mosquito, I think.

2428
02:42:51,560 --> 02:42:54,000
There's two videos because Doki's really into it.

2429
02:42:57,620 --> 02:43:01,340
It reminds me, have you ever seen the old movie, it's called Slither?

2430
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:02,840
It has like...

2431
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:04,920
She linked the second video.

2432
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:08,080
It has like Merle from The Walking Dead in it.

2433
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:14,960
And he kind of does that, like, when he has that whole thing with the weird, like, tube thing, and it, like, for reproduction.

2434
02:43:15,260 --> 02:43:17,120
And you kind of just brought back a really horrible memory.

2435
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:17,720
Thank you.

2436
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:18,400
Wait, what?

2437
02:43:18,680 --> 02:43:20,640
Oh, I do know this.

2438
02:43:21,020 --> 02:43:25,220
Yeah, it's like, it's like Merle from the Walking Dead and Nathan Phelan.

2439
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:28,480
Merle and Nathan Phelan?

2440
02:43:29,060 --> 02:43:29,480
Yeah.

2441
02:43:29,860 --> 02:43:31,640
What movie is it called?

2442
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:32,720
Slither.

2443
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:33,820
Slither.

2444
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:35,480
Slither.

2445
02:43:36,140 --> 02:43:36,340
Yeah.

2446
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:38,580
At one point, a woman blows up with...

2447
02:43:38,600 --> 02:44:09,200

Oh, yeah.

2451
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:19,200
By the way, chat, before we decided on Mage Arena, there was another game that I brought up.

2452
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:19,840
Oh, my God.

2453
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:23,060
Oh, my God.

2454
02:44:23,460 --> 02:44:24,480
It was called, what was it?

2455
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:25,200
Bogos.

2456
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:26,300
Bogos Binted.

2457
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:27,960
Yeah, there was a card.

2458
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:29,140
Bogos Binted even.

2459
02:44:29,360 --> 02:44:29,900
Bogos Binted.

2460
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:30,880
Bogos Binted.

2461
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:35,280
And I was like, and then I was like, guys, we should play Bogos Binted, guys.

2462
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,580
And then Min was like, why don't, how about?

2463
02:44:39,860 --> 02:45:09,120
majorina no i don't i don't think i suggested that was my suggestion oh is it snuffy oh yeah no it's not even just bogos binted it's bogos binted with a question mark and it's oh right right right it's liars liars game liars bar with aliens but basically yeah yeah but with like four other game modes yeah oh yeah it was snuffy it was like that or the wizard game i think they have cool.

2464
02:45:09,420 --> 02:45:12,000
There's also this really funny game.

2465
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:17,080
Okay, chat, this was the game that I first suggested before we pivoted.

2466
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:22,820
It has, like, Italian brain rot memes in it, and I think and stuff.

2467
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:23,200
What?

2468
02:45:23,640 --> 02:45:24,260
Wait, what?

2469
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:26,340
Italian brain rot memes?

2470
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:27,540
Yeah, you know.

2471
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:29,100
Like, what?

2472
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:31,940
Like, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue.

2473
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:35,620
Chimpanzee and badanini.

2474
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:38,400
Where does that say that?

2475
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:39,460
Galilee.

2476
02:45:50,620 --> 02:45:52,800
You don't know them all by name, dude.

2477
02:45:53,660 --> 02:45:55,560
They have their own theme songs.

2478
02:45:56,420 --> 02:45:59,020
No, but like where do you see it in the game?

2479
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:02,860
Oh, I don't know.

2480
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:03,880
I thought it was in there.

2481
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:05,200
She also played it up and tried it out.

2482
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:06,300
She played the tutorial.

2483
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:07,000
She was ready.

2484
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:07,860
Dedicated.

2485
02:46:08,040 --> 02:46:08,220
Yeah.

2486
02:46:08,600 --> 02:47:05,560
i made the game that's what if it wasn't like an impossible ask i think it would be so funny if we like made each other games to play in some sort of shitty way that would be so funny i wish i wish it was that easy i was gonna say a man made bogos binnet the developer's name was bad badger stop doxing my my alter ego from bad badger themselves yeah yep ggs guys i had a lot of fun gg very much everyone let's play four games later next time good night yeah it was fun casting spells with you it was fun yeah are you continuing to stream are you still streaming i will i will okay i'll send my my people your way then i would send it to you other guys but you're on youtube so i won't

2487
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:10,120
I'm a YouTube streamer.

2488
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:10,400
I'm not.

2489
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:11,100
That's fair.

2490
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:11,540
That's fair.

2491
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:13,640
My endurance is very low.

2492
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:16,400
You would be surprised, though.

2493
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:17,600
I mean, give yourself more credit.

2494
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:20,140
Working as hard as a streamer, I mean, that's like funny.

2495
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:25,800
People will be like, duh, play games, but you do do a lot other than just like going live, so, you know?

2496
02:47:26,320 --> 02:47:27,400
That's sweet stuff.

2497
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:27,860
You're right.

2498
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:30,020
Maybe I'll stream Marvel Rivals later on Twitch.

2499
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:38,180
Maybe you could play like a little kind of creature, you know?

2500
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:38,520
Yeah.

2501
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:39,160
Bye!

2502
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:40,780
Bye, guys.

2503
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:41,560
Bye, guys.

2504
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:46,760
Bye, I'm leaving too.

2505
02:47:46,900 --> 02:47:47,420
Bye, bye.

2506
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:48,260
Bye, bye.

2507
02:47:48,660 --> 02:47:49,440
Bye, bye.

2508
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:50,040
Wow.

2509
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:52,200
That was fun.

2510
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:53,260
That was fun.

2511
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:58,040
Sorry, sound team, for picking up the volume a little while ago.

2512
02:47:58,440 --> 02:48:00,060
But we figured it out in the end.

2513
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:03,880
Guys, we figured it out.

2514
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:04,500
That was fun.

2515
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:06,160
I always love playing the sloppy sisters.

2516
02:48:06,760 --> 02:48:09,780
I am going to rest my voice because I was coughing a lot.

2517
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:11,200
I'm not actually going to stream more.

2518
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:20,320
Matt, more Marvel Revisator, because I was coughing a lot, so I'm going to rest my voice now.

2519
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:22,320
But I hope you guys all had a great time watching.

2520
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:24,260
It's always fun playing with them.

2521
02:48:24,460 --> 02:48:27,900
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

2522
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:31,580
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2523
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:35,900
And if you stay up for us, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2524
02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:37,580
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2525
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:39,400
Bye, guys.

2526
02:48:39,980 --> 02:48:40,440
Bye.

2527
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:42,540
Bye.
