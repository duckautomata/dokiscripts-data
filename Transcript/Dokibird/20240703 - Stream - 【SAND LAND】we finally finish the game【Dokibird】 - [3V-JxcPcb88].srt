1
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,910
Well, good morning everybody!

2
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:58,770
Oh my gosh, I feel so well rested today because I passed out after the mademadon.

3
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,350
I think I slept like at least 15 hours yesterday.

4
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,290
I remember like making my waiting room and then I was out.

5
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,590
I was just... I'm gone.

6
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,450
Oh my god, I was so tired.

7
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,690
I think I needed to like catch up sleep from Dokome and Avcon as well.

8
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,110
Because I don't think I slept as much as I would have liked after the conventions there.

9
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,290
And then like after madon stream, I just was like, I'm gone.

10
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,010
I'm out.

11
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,170
I was like, I'm going to take a nap and then I get some work done.

12
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:38,630
But also because I slept really early on, I didn't get any work done after the stream.

13
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,330
So...

14
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,750
My staff was like, Dokie, we really need you to finish this up.

15
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,890
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,270
I just... I'm sorry.

17
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,350
I just woke up.

18
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,150
I was like, I'm sorry.

19
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,550
I took a nap and then I ended up sleeping.

20
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,970
I know I was going to get it done yesterday.

21
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,190
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,350
I'll get it done today after Sandland.

23
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,970
I know it could be an endurance stream today because I'm playing Sandland until completion.

24
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,430
But like I swear.

25
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,530
I swear.

26
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,570
I swear I'll get started.

27
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,170
I swear.

28
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,790
But Dokie, Bureau Clock.

29
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,810
Fucking Bureau Clock.

30
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,910
Welcome to the Mediapart.

31
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,650
Welcome, welcome.

32
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,530
Oh my gosh.

33
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,330
Yesterday was fucking wild.

34
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,870
What a... I still can't believe we... everybody lived.

35
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,090
Everybody lived and then Bureau Clock came in with a steel chair.

36
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,570
I even...

37
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,470
I even foretold it.

38
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,090
I was like, man, I swear to God.

39
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,590
If we... if Julia just dies because of Bureau Clock, I swear to fucking God.

40
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,990
Bureau Clock.

41
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,890
Oh.

42
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,410
Oh, anyway, if you guys didn't know, the PAL World VOD is back.

43
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,530
With the chat fixed.

44
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,910
I have no idea what the fuck happened with the PAL World stream.

45
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,390
Because like, it got... the chat for it was like, broken.

46
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,690
And for like, a couple of days.

47
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,110
And then they took down the stream.

48
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,610
I got no... zero notification, by the way.

49
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,630
I had zero notification about PAL World VOD.

50
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,850
And then... um... so I was confused.

51
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,490
I was like, what happened to PAL World?

52
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,070
And then... and then like, I messaged my YouTube guy about it.

53
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,250
But like, he didn't reply back in time.

54
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,530
And then the stream just came back with the chat fixed.

55
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,390
I was like, okay, I said a lot of stuff.

56
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,470
I was gonna say, what did I say?

57
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,970
And I was like, no, I said a lot of very sketchy things.

58
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:57,190
I'm just wondering, I'm just wondering if it had to do with like, the YouTube like, bots being like, oh, my God.

59
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,450
She said so much stuff.

60
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,930
And then, they're like, they're like, concerned because the chat was like.

61
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,350
Is this a hostage situation?

62
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,610
Because what the fuck is going on in chat, too?

63
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,230
And that was like, so much shit.

64
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,330
That's why they took down the chat.

65
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,430
Because like, we both... me and the dragoons, like both of us, it's not just a me thing.

66
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,330
This was a team effort.

67
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,870
Both of us said some very extreme things during that stream.

68
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:25,350
So like, I would not be surprised if like, the VOD got flagged by like the YouTube bot system.

69
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,850
And like, so they took down the chat because they're like, they have to analyze the chat to see like, what's going on.

70
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,010
Because they're like, maybe this isn't friendly for viewers.

71
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:46,530
And then they're like, alright, we gotta take down this bot and match it up with the stream and see like, what's going on.

72
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,810
I'm not spreading the blame.

73
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,590
I'm sharing the blame.

74
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,950
Sharing is caring.

75
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,050
That's what Care Bears taught me, okay guys?

76
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,290
Did you not learn from Care Bears?

77
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,770
We gotta share it.

78
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,830
Hey, chat was taken down.

79
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,150
It wasn't the bot.

80
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,350
That was taken down first.

81
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,710
It was chat that was taken down first.

82
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,690
They targeted the chat first.

83
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,490
So something happened in chat that made YouTube be like, we're gonna take the chat down.

84
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,490
They didn't take the bot down first.

85
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,970
And then later, they took the bot down.

86
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,610
Oh, you want me to...

87
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,650
Oh yeah, you watch Care Bears?

88
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,790
Name all the Care Bears.

89
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,350
There's Brave Bear.

90
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,130
Wait, no, he's not Brave...

91
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,930
No, he's not a bear.

92
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,150
He's a lion.

93
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,130
He's a lion.

94
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,830
He's a brave... Braveheart?

95
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,630
No, he's a cousin.

96
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,190
Okay, okay, okay.

97
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,170
We wanna know...

98
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,490
Okay, there's Grumpy Bear.

99
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,890
There's Joy Bear.

100
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,830
There's Braveheart, who's a cousin of the Care Bears.

101
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,110
There's Cheer Bear.

102
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,790
There's Sunshine Bear.

103
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,710
There's Sleepy Bear.

104
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,150
There's...

105
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,930
See, I told you.

106
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,130
I know the Care Bears and their cousins.

107
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,210
I used to watch Care Bears when they did reruns.

108
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,370
Like, three, two, one, go.

109
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,930
Something, something.

110
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,390
Care Bear's there.

111
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,390
Okay, maybe I don't remember Care Bear as much as I thought.

112
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,210
Maybe...

113
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,340
I had a Care Bear Sona!

114
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,140
Because I really...

115
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,260
I actually drew a Care Bear Sona back then because they released this new Care Bear designs.

116
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,840
And I thought it was super cute.

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,360
So I made myself a Care Bear Sona.

118
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,540
Because I thought it was...

119
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,700
Who's Dumpy Bear?

120
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,020
Is there actually Dumpy Bear?

121
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,100
Please...

122
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,760
Oh my gosh.

123
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm going to look up Dumpy Bear because of you guys.

124
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,260
There's Bumpy Bear.

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,160
Dumpy Bear.

126
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,720
Okay.

127
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,440
Oh my god.

128
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
Okay, there was...

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
There's no actual Dumpy Bear.

130
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,660
Care Bears.

131
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,340
Care Bear...

132
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,980
Care Bear names.

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,440
Okay.

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,360
Alright.

135
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,340
There's...

136
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
Oh my god, guys!

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,280
What's your Care Bear nickname?

138
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,220
What the...

139
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,320
Who the fuck is going to be called Magical Bear?

140
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,460
That's so stupid.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,360
Alright.

142
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,420
I know my Care Bears.

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,940
I don't know if you guys know your...

144
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,560
I bet you guys...

145
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,020
I bet some of you guys aren't even old...

146
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,060
Weren't even old enough to watch the Care Bear TV show.

147
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,820
Oh my god.

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,240
Okay.

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,380
Speaking of that...

150
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,560
Speaking of like people not being old enough...

151
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,440
I actually...

152
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,920
Oh, there's Friend Bear!

153
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,040
There's Friend Bear.

154
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,820
There's Tender Heart Bear.

155
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,980
There's Share...

156
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,740
Oh my god!

157
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,820
I love Wish Bear!

158
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,840
Okay, Wish Bear was really cute.

159
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,340
I really liked Wish Bear's colors.

160
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,500
Um...

161
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,540
There's Fun...

162
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,040
Why the fuck do we need Fun Shine Bear and Cheer Bear?

163
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
It's redundant!

164
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,100
Your job is like redundant!

165
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,760
Your job is like...

166
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
You share the same job!

167
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:57,880
There's...

168
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,860
What's the difference between True Heart Bear and fucking Tender Heart Bear?

169
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,140
You're both hearts!

170
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,880
The Secret Bear...

171
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
That's not sharing.

172
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,780
Secret Bear should not exist.

173
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,860
Secret Bear is like...

174
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,440
It's like...

175
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,940
That's not...

176
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,860
That does not...

177
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,760
Like, what does that help with the children?

178
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,480
Kids should not have secrets.

179
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,820
If a child has a secret, you have to know the secret because it could be a bad secret.

180
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,660
Like...

181
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,380
Like...

182
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,600
Dad teaching kids bad things.

183
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,120
Secret Bear is a bad secret.

184
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,260
It's a bad bear.

185
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,080
Anyway.

186
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,720
Let's see, what I was gonna say.

187
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,560
Sorry, I got distracted.

188
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,880
Okay, speaking of children.

189
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,380
Okay, I need to tell you guys a story.

190
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,660
See, Sandland Street...

191
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,820
Sandland viewers get exclusive convention stories.

192
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,840
Because you are willing to watch part six of a JRPG.

193
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,640
So I will treat you guys...

194
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,880
You guys get the exclusive con stories.

195
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,720
Alright, so during like, AvCon, during AvCon, I was doing my panel.

196
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,200
Um, Dokimi, people who are at Dokimi knows this story because I told this at Dokimi.

197
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,220
But like, during AvCon, I was like, huh.

198
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:22,000
I was like, okay, I was, I started dropping like, fuck and like, saying shit, fuck and all that stuff.

199
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,220
I started dropping swears and then I was like, oh shit, I shouldn't be saying swears.

200
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,840
Because there might be children here.

201
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,500
But then I was like, oh, it's Australia.

202
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,460
It's alright.

203
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,620
You kids, Australians teach your kids swears at an early age.

204
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,620
So it should be fine.

205
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,500
And then... but then, the thing is, we had the Q&A portion.

206
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,500
Um, we were at the Q&A portion of the panel.

207
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:55,620
And then the second person in the Q&A, wait, no, not second, the first person who asked me a question was a child.

208
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:08,330
So I was like, I, cause like, he started talking on the mic and I was like, wait, how old are you?

209
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,270
Wait, are you a child?

210
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,310
I was like, are you a child?

211
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,870
How old are you?

212
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,590
Please be older than 13.

213
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,410
And then the child was like, I'm 11.

214
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,670
I was like, oh no, I'm 11.

215
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,580
I was like, no!

216
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,280
How

217
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,020
old are you to watch my streams?

218
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,480
And he was like...

219
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,720
I was like, no, you know, I can put whatever age I want when I join Discord.

220
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,660
And I'm like, no, that's not, that's not a good thing.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,740
Oh my god, that's a, there's a reason why Discord has tighter regulation regarding age of children signing up for Discord.

222
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,480
And I was like, no!

223
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:10,840
And then, and then, for his parents, his mom was right next to him.

224
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,360
And I was like, I'm sorry, child.

225
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
I swore a lot.

226
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:22,000
And the child, the child was like, yeah, you were dropping like F-bombs while I was just sitting here.

227
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,880
And I'm just like, what the fuck?

228
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
I got called out by a child.

229
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,300
Oh my god.

230
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,200
I got called out by a child.

231
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,660
Oh my god.

232
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,380
Anyway.

233
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,780
Um, I felt very embarrassed that day.

234
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,920
I was not ready.

235
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,900
You know, I said that as a joke.

236
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,140
Being like, hee hee hee.

237
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,880
I didn't swear.

238
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,380
Because I assumed that everybody in the audience were not children.

239
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,820
But there was children at the panel.

240
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,100
And I was not...

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,740
I was not, I was not ready to find out there were children at the panel.

242
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,120
I did not realize that parents were putting me on the iPads.

243
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,240
Like I was the Cocomelon of VTube.

244
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,340
That was the day I found out.

245
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,080
I was the Cocomelon of VTubers.

246
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,680
You live long enough to become the villain.

247
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,700
You live long enough to become the villain.

248
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,500
The plot twist.

249
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,840
The despair.

250
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,220
The plot twist.

251
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,400
Oh my god.

252
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,100
Also, apparently, I'm also like really, really good with, for pets too.

253
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,300
I am the Cocomelon of VTubers.

254
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,340
Because I had people come up and was like, I put your vibe on the iPads.

255
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,800
You are my dog's Oshi.

256
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,480
Because every time, because like my dog is like super hyperactive.

257
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,980
But the moment I put your vibe on for my dog, she like calms down.

258
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,320
And I'm like, that's so funny and cool.

259
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,760
But now that cements the fact that I am the Cocomelon of VTubers.

260
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,480
But now that cements the fact that I am the Cocomelon of VTubers.

261
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,380
Oh my god.

262
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,880
Um.

263
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,880
Um.

264
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,320
Real pain, dude.

265
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,960
Thank you, super chat.

266
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,240
I'm the dog whisperer.

267
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,020
Hi, today is my birthday.

268
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,060
And I was wondering if I could get a happy birthday for my favorite bird with the most infectious laughter.

269
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,500
Thank you, super chat.

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Thank you, thank you.

271
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,300
And of course, happy birthday to you.

272
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,960
Happy birthday to you.

273
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,900
Happy birthday, dear Payton.

274
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,340
Happy birthday to you.

275
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,540
Happy birthday!

276
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,660
But yes.

277
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,100
At least like, okay.

278
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:52,540
If I am being used as your pet's stream of choice, create a YouTube account for them and subscribe to my channel.

279
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
That's the least you can do, right?

280
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,280
Yeah, but create a YouTube account for your pet and subscribe.

281
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,700
Gotta hit a million subscribers guys.

282
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,300
Gotta hit a million subscribers guys.

283
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,260
Oh my god.

284
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,560
I still can't believe children watch me.

285
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:17,920
I still can't believe children watch me.

286
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,700
I can't.

287
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,820
Oh my god.

288
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,380
Dokie Bird for all ages.

289
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,660
Guys, I'm so...

290
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,100
I'm universally...

291
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,460
I'm universally age appropriate.

292
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,940
Despite the things I say.

293
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,420
Despite the things I say.

294
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,220
Um, Peachy, thank you for the super chat.

295
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,040
Thank you, thank you.

296
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,020
Doki, no offense.

297
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,140
I don't think I trust you with my children.

298
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,400
What do you mean?

299
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,080
I'm the Cocomelon!

300
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,120
Okay, Cocomelon is not good for your kids.

301
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,000
But, okay, that sounds right.

302
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,000
Because Cocomelon is... I talked about this before.

303
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,600
But Cocomelon is not good for your children.

304
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,220
And it actually stops brain development.

305
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,340
Um...

306
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm not joking when I say that.

307
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,120
Um...

308
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:11,160
Cocomelon actually, like, hurts your child's, like, brain development.

309
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,160
Because it's not... it doesn't grow the child's brain.

310
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,340
Yeah, like, the CDC actually wrote out...

311
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,780
Yeah, because they're like, you have to stop showing your children Cocomelon.

312
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,840
Because your kids are not developing properly because of that.

313
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,500
Because of their channel.

314
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,620
Um...

315
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,360
Um...

316
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,800
Yeah, there's nothing educational.

317
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,620
It's literally brain rot for children.

318
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,140
It's...

319
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,080
But, that means I'm different.

320
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,560
I'm better.

321
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,580
I give you guys fun facts, guys.

322
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,520
I give you guys fun facts.

323
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,980
Chat, it's not...

324
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,380
I do not rot your brain.

325
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,420
Sometimes I give you guys really fun facts.

326
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,140
Thank you for the super chat.

327
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,520
Thank you.

328
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,920
Thank you.

329
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,180
What do you mean you're not kid friendly?

330
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,640
So, you're the reason my dog also started to swear.

331
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,600
Thank you for this.

332
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,040
Thank you for the super chat.

333
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,660
Thank you.

334
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,340
Thank you.

335
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,400
Fun facts makes you smarter.

336
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,320
It does.

337
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
Did you guys know...

338
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,940
Okay, here's a fun fact.

339
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,280
So, you guys know that the Mercy...

340
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,640
The pink Mercy skin recently came back to Overwatch.

341
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,240
Overwatch.

342
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,980
Um, and like...

343
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,580
I don't know if you guys know this.

344
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,680
But there was an underground pink Mercy...

345
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,040
Um...

346
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,420
Uh...

347
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,980
What's it called?

348
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,720
Black Market.

349
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,020
There was an underground pink Mercy Black Market.

350
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,240
Before they like...

351
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,840
Brought back the pink Mercy skin.

352
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,920
So like...

353
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,020
The accounts who had pink Mercy...

354
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,320
Because like...

355
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,200
The charity thing was the only way to get it back then.

356
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,200
It was like a one time thing.

357
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,120
And like back then, people were selling accounts for like $400 to $500.

358
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,700
And that was like the minimum budget.

359
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,840
People were like, I only have a budget for $500.

360
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,440
Please, I really want a pink Mercy skin.

361
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,660
And like...

362
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,420
And like...

363
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,960
So there was like actually an underground black market for pink Mercy skin.

364
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,560
Just for that skin.

365
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,840
Um...

366
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,460
Why is it pink?

367
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,560
Because it was for breast cancer.

368
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,660
Um...

369
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
And then like...

370
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,780
I could...

371
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,620
I could have sold my account!

372
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,380
I don't know if you guys know this.

373
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,140
But selling accounts is against TOS.

374
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,720
So...

375
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,820
Yeah.

376
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,880
So...

377
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,260
So people...

378
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,920
So when the pink Mercy skin came back like last week.

379
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,400
The fucking thing quit.

380
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,180
And then like...

381
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,600
Like the market crashed so hard.

382
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,100
Because obviously now you can...

383
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
Now you can fucking...

384
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,520
You know, now you can buy it for like $10 or something.

385
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:42,880
I don't know.

386
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,000
I actually don't know how much it is.

387
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,360
Because my main account is in HKD.

388
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,720
Hong Kong dollars.

389
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,760
So like...

390
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,540
I don't know.

391
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,860
I'm too lazy to put the conversion rate.

392
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,520
I didn't log into another account.

393
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,460
I didn't log into another account to see what the prices was.

394
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,320
Um...

395
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,380
So...

396
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,480
Also, Blake, welcome to Tomato Farm.

397
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:03,820
Welcome.

398
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,200
Welcome.

399
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,380
Um...

400
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:05,940
But yeah.

401
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,860
It's actually crazy that...

402
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,640
It's actually crazy that...

403
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,340
Just for the pink Mercy skin itself.

404
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,080
It was $400 to $500 minimum.

405
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,940
I didn't know this because like...

406
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,720
Uh...

407
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,780
Because I saw it like...

408
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,660
I saw it on Twitter.

409
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,980
And somebody screen capped some poor Mercy one trick.

410
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,680
Who's like...

411
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,580
Please, I only have a budget of $500.

412
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,360
I don't know.

413
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,180
I really want a pink Mercy skin.

414
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,760
I can only go as high as $500.

415
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,760
Because that is the budget I have.

416
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,120
Like someone was willingly asking for this.

417
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,960
For five...

418
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,500
I was like...

419
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,340
What the fuck?

420
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,360
Are you...

421
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,910
Oh Jesus!

422
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,590
Jacked up!

423
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,170
I couldn't believe it.

424
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,490
I couldn't...

425
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,170
I couldn't believe that like...

426
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,850
People were willingly paying that much for a fucking Mercy skin.

427
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,070
I was like...

428
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,130
I don't even know how much money you're making.

429
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,750
Of all things.

430
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,470
Like...

431
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,110
Like...

432
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,290
It's not even the best skin.

433
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,810
Like I'm sorry.

434
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,070
Mercy has like better skins than...

435
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,590
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,810
But I don't think the pink Mercy skin even looked that good.

437
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,430
Like...

438
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,550
I owned it from what the first...

439
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,350
From the very first charity.

440
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,870
Like the event that they did for like the OG charity event.

441
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,070
And I'm just like it doesn't even look that good.

442
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,890
It's just the fact...

443
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,570
It's cute...

444
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,130
Okay...

445
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,330
Hey, you can say it's cute though.

446
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:44,330
But like if you look at the Mercy tier skin list, like the pink Mercy is not the best skin they have for Mercy.

447
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,930
Like, I'm sorry.

448
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,990
Like, all it has is that it's pink.

449
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:50,610
I understand.

450
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,410
I understand people are like, I need everything to be pink.

451
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,030
But like, it's not even the best Mercy skin.

452
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,390
Of course there's a Mercy skin tier list.

453
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,530
You don't understand.

454
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,450
The Mercy main community is...

455
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,190
I'm sorry for all the Mercy pla- Oh my gosh, I'm so scared.

456
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,810
I don't want the Mercy community to like fucking flame me.

457
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,950
But like, you know what?

458
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,790
I already have like so many antis.

459
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,210
Like, I'll just get in the Mercy antis in here too.

460
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:19,990
Like...

461
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,710
Like, I'll just add Mercy players as antis as well.

462
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,010
Like...

463
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,390
It's alright.

464
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,850
It's already too late.

465
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,110
Like...

466
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,790
Um...

467
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,090
But...

468
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,070
I'm just...

469
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,350
The Mercy community is so scary.

470
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,010
As someone that...

471
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:44,330
As someone that used to be in the...

472
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,010
In like the Overwatch community.

473
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,530
If you piss off the Mercy main community...

474
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,140
Like, it is like...

475
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,950
Okay, so you know like...

476
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,390
The extreme side of...

477
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,010
Like...

478
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,590
The really, really bad side of like...

479
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,610
Of stans.

480
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,670
Like, doesn't matter what type of stans.

481
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,770
But like...

482
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,230
But like, before stanning things was a thing...

483
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,870
They used...

484
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,360
They used to be like...

485
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,530
All within the Mercy main community.

486
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,270
Like, it was basically like...

487
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,610
Before stans were a thing...

488
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,590
The Mercy community was sort of like...

489
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,190
The OG type shit.

490
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,150
Of...

491
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,830
Of like...

492
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,010
The extremely dedicated...

493
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,870
To Mercy.

494
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,930
Like...

495
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,950
If you have one...

496
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,170
If you have a negative opinion on Mercy as a character...

497
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,670
Like, you would get flamed so hard on Twitter.

498
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,890
Like...

499
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,670
Oh my god.

500
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,990
I remember cause like...

501
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,450
There was a whole movement...

502
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,110
There was a whole movement...

503
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,050
Where like...

504
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,810
Mercy...

505
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,130
Mercy mains were asking for like...

506
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,190
Mercy to be buffed.

507
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,850
And then they're like...

508
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,150
What was it?

509
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,650
What was it?

510
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,930
Mercy rework or something?

511
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,750
It was like some hashtag.

512
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,730
It was some fucking hashtag.

513
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,670
Where it was like...

514
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,230
Mercy reworked or something.

515
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,250
I don't remember.

516
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,470
It was so long ago.

517
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,650
And then...

518
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,410
And then like...

519
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:07,950
The other...

520
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,150
All the other players...

521
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,270
Were like...

522
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,350
Were like...

523
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,050
I don't know guys.

524
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,630
Like, I think Mercy is good where it is.

525
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,250
And then if you had that opinion...

526
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,110
Of being like...

527
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,710
I think Mercy is good where it is.

528
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,590
You would get flamed so hard...

529
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,970
On the Mercy main community.

530
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,130
Because there was like...

531
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,070
And then it got to the point...

532
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,790
Um...

533
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,410
Oh yeah.

534
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:30,970
Oh yeah.

535
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,390
They like...

536
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,910
DDoS the official forums.

537
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,650
Oh yeah.

538
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:33,830
Yeah.

539
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,610
I remember that.

540
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,150
It got so bad.

541
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,330
That like...

542
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,610
Because there was a huge movement regarding Mercy.

543
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,610
Um...

544
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,510
And then like...

545
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,230
Rework Mercy.

546
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,890
That they DDoS the official Blizzard forums.

547
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,670
Because all they did...

548
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,270
Was like...

549
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,010
Spamming the forums to...

550
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,110
Demand a rework on Mercy.

551
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,870
And then at one point...

552
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,250
I remember at one point...

553
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,370
They started fighting amongst themselves.

554
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,350
Because the leader of the community...

555
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,490
Got exposed to be the leader...

556
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,230
Of the fucking rework Mercy movement.

557
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,470
Got exposed to be like a hater or some shit.

558
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,450
Like she got like fucking revealed...

559
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,150
Within like some fucking twitlogger or google doc.

560
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,610
To be like a really bad person.

561
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,250
So then the Mercy players were infighting amongst themselves.

562
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,270
Um...

563
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,830
Because apparently the leader of the Mercy...

564
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,330
Movement...

565
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,010
Would like shit talk other Mercy streamers.

566
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:31,890
Um...

567
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,210
And then so they were like...

568
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:33,610
Oh my...

569
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,430
Yeah it was a civil war within the Mercy community.

570
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,470
Because the leader of the rework Mercy movement...

571
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,370
Was revealed to be shit talking...

572
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,670
And like against other Mercy streamers.

573
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,370
And like being like a horrible person in general.

574
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,090
That she ended up deleting her YouTube channel.

575
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,230
Because it was such a bad expose.

576
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,870
That she deleted her YouTube channel.

577
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,250
And like privated her Twitter account.

578
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,470
Because people were like...

579
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,010
What the fuck?

580
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,490
Like people were like...

581
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,190
And then...

582
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,070
And then they all like...

583
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,690
Infight...

584
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,750
And then there was no more leader.

585
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,850
And then the rework Mercy movement died.

586
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,890
Like...

587
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,390
Yeah the rework Mercy movement died because of it.

588
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,090
Because they cancelled their own leader.

589
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,850
Oh my god.

590
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,090
Um...

591
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,530
It was...

592
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,030
It was so bad.

593
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,430
But anyway...

594
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,890
Yeah like I said like...

595
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,470
I'm...

596
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,090
I'm afraid of the Mercy community sometimes too.

597
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,150
Because...

598
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,770
Um...

599
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,210
They get very very passionate...

600
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:37,930
Um...

601
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,570
About Mercy in general.

602
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:45,610
I mean people are willing to spend 500 dollars minimum...

603
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,990
On a pink Mercy skin.

604
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,750
And that shit is crazy.

605
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,050
I know.

606
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,910
Like...

607
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,530
Not no skin should be worth that much.

608
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,230
It was for charity too.

609
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,950
It was for charity.

610
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,970
That's the worst part.

611
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,910
I feel like...

612
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,010
Jesus Christ.

613
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,190
You're selling...

614
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,650
A fucking skin that was for breast cancer.

615
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,150
For 500 plus dollars.

616
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,990
Oh my god.

617
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,150
I wonder if like people can still like...

618
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,550
Why do I know so much about it?

619
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,290
Because it was...

620
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,610
I used to frequent Overwatch TMZ.

621
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,210
And because like...

622
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,590
There was always so much gossip regarding like the Overwatch community.

623
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,090
Um...

624
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,770
And...

625
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,110
And like...

626
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,550
Um...

627
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,870
That was a whole arc that was there.

628
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,590
It was...

629
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,650
There was a whole TMZ dedicated.

630
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,490
Like a gossip...

631
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,830
A gossip like Reddit regarding Overwatch community.

632
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,310
And it was so funny.

633
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,630
It was so...

634
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,310
It was so interesting to read about.

635
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,290
Because like I...

636
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,430
When I used to be...

637
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,430
Play Overwatch...

638
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,290
I would read about it.

639
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:52,630
And be like...

640
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,770
Alright.

641
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,750
Time to read my daily TMZ news regarding the Overwatch community.

642
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,030
And like...

643
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,410
That was like one of the arcs that they had.

644
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,610
Alright.

645
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:01,930
Let's see.

646
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,830
Rework Mercy.

647
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,990
Rework Mercy.

648
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,890
Okay.

649
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,610
Let's see if I can...

650
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,090
Um...

651
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,770
Actually, I don't know if they still...

652
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,770
If like...

653
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,490
If that's like...

654
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,150
Because I know like most of the really...

655
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,530
The really popular like videos about reworking Mercy.

656
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,950
Got deleted.

657
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,270
Because...

658
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:24,810
Um...

659
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,990
Like I said...

660
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,690
It like...

661
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,750
The leader got exposed to be a terrible...

662
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,450
Oh, there you go.

663
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,450
The rework Mercy movement.

664
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,430
I don't know if this...

665
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,630
Oh, yeah.

666
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,110
If you literally look up the hashtag...

667
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,550
Rework Mercy.

668
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,430
Like you can see like videos about it.

669
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,670
It's like...

670
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,330
Join the rework Mercy movement today.

671
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,370
What about Rein?

672
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,610
Like...

673
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,890
I swear to God.

674
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:54,690
Every...

675
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,230
Like...

676
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,310
Like they complain about Mercy.

677
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,630
But like Rein players...

678
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,910
Rein one tricks...

679
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,770
Rein mains...

680
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,310
Had it the worst out of everybody.

681
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,330
Like...

682
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,410
At least Mercy actually gets buffs.

683
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:08,970
Rein...

684
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:15,350
Rein players has been fucked so hard for like five plus years now.

685
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,750
And they don't complain.

686
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,510
I don't know.

687
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,950
I don't even know how they are still alive.

688
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,670
Oh my God.

689
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,750
Rein players are stronger than any of us.

690
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,410
Rein mains are actually like...

691
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,630
They're different.

692
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,730
They don't complain.

693
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,450
They just...

694
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,430
They just exist and continue to throw and grief games as Rein.

695
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,310
They don't care if their character is absolutely dog.

696
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,790
They don't care.

697
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:51,770
They're just...

698
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,170
They keep hammering and throwing other people's games by playing Rein.

699
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,410
It doesn't matter to them.

700
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,610
They got problems but they keep going.

701
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,970
Rein mains are still different.

702
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,270
It hurts but we're used to it.

703
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,350
I avoid every Rein player I meet.

704
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,690
I'm sorry.

705
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,290
It doesn't matter how good you are.

706
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,190
You are as Rein.

707
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,330
You're playing Rein.

708
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,990
Like, what the fuck do you want me to do?

709
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:32,230
Yeah, you might make it work for like one game but one...

710
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,310
But it's like one game out of 10 and like those...

711
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,070
I don't want to be the luckier side of your good...

712
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,390
good gameplay of Rein.

713
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,550
I don't want to be the lucky side of it.

714
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,530
No, right?

715
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,750
He's into it.

716
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,050
Yeah.

717
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:49,270
Yeah.

718
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,650
But the big ham... guys, it's Reinhardt.

719
00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:00,070
The only way that like... the only way you guys can succeed is if you make the other team also play Rein.

720
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:06,810
But then if one of you guys... if the other team isn't a Rein main and they start losing, they'll pick Maga and fuck you up.

721
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,870
Like, what do you want?

722
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,010
Nah, the rest of your team isn't into that.

723
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,210
You might be super into Rein.

724
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,550
But the rest of the team wants to win.

725
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,270
Like, stop saying the truth.

726
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,130
Anyway, we're finishing Sandland today despite the long tangent we had.

727
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,410
The 30 minute tangent we had.

728
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,710
Guys, we're gonna finish... I swear, we're gonna finish Sandland.

729
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,630
I need to reboot Sandland because it doesn't register my controller.

730
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:42,690
But like, despite the long tangent we had, the long yap session, now... now we finished Sandland.

731
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,830
See, guys?

732
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,190
If you come to Sandland streams, you get these...

733
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,690
exclusive stories that the other dragoons don't get.

734
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,490
These tangents only happens in Sandland.

735
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,650
You... you guys... you guys got... like, you guys got spoiled today.

736
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,810
We're gonna beat the game, I swear to God.

737
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,710
Guys, we're gonna beat the game.

738
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,950
Why can't I... why is my controller not registering?

739
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,190
I don't understand.

740
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,970
Oh, there we go.

741
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,590
Now it is.

742
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,950
Alright, here we go.

743
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,170
We're actually gonna beat the game.

744
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,270
For real, guys.

745
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,450
Uh, we're back in Sandland.

746
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,230
I don't know if you guys know this, but we're back in Sandland.

747
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,650
Alright, open the door.

748
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,570
Exclusive tangents, yes.

749
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,790
That's right, you guys get the exclusive...

750
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,850
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

751
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,970
Oh, is it here?

752
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,810
Tricky Jumper Ken?

753
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,290
Where... which one's the objective?

754
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,470
Give the flowers...

755
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,230
Oh, here!

756
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:43,930
Okay.

757
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:44,850
Okay.

758
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,150
Okay.

759
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,090
Oh, thank God.

760
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,250
Thank God I already went here.

761
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,910
Uh, brother, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

762
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,890
Thank you, thank you!

763
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,510
Oh, this way?

764
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,750
Oh yeah, it's this way.

765
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:56,890
Alright.

766
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:57,790
See you guys.

767
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,050
I told you we're gonna progress.

768
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,510
I told you guys!

769
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,350
General Ace!

770
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,130
We have news for you!

771
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,970
You look even worse than the last time we saw you.

772
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,650
Yeah, what happened?

773
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,110
Have you been getting any sleep at all?

774
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,130
Sleep hasn't been part of my life.

775
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,930
I've been reading the Lexicon for the past few days.

776
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,610
What were you doing?

777
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,510
I was in Forest Land.

778
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,070
What are you doing in Sun Land?

779
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,330
I have another brutal meeting ahead, so I can't talk long.

780
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,050
It won't help with your sleep, but here's our situation so far.

781
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,550
You see, it seems they're quite confident in their strength.

782
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,870
Epi says they've already moved a huge force near the border.

783
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,330
Our garrison along the border won't stand a chance.

784
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,050
I'm sorry.

785
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,170
Though to be frank, that goes for the entire- Don't we have an army too?

786
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,530
Oh, looks like it's turned into my army.

787
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,010
Our entire thing was being an army.

788
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,970
This entire country was run on by an army.

789
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,350
We've prepared lodgings for you.

790
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,330
You can stay there for- I think it's also because I sort of destroyed half their army too.

791
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,310
Maybe that's the thing.

792
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,450
I'll be taking my leave now.

793
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,870
We'll talk again later.

794
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,250
Yeah, you're right.

795
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,210
I was gonna say, wait, no, I destroyed half of their army.

796
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:10,970
I remember that.

797
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,150
But I also destroyed their army too!

798
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,610
It's equivalent exchange.

799
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,050
If the royal army won't be able to stop the Forest Land army, I'll-

800
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,390
Wait, why not?

801
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:41,110
What's the proposal?

802
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,110
I thought that's what we were doing originally.

803
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,810
Okay, but the king is worthless.

804
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,730
What the fuck?

805
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,530
Why does the king not believe in us?

806
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,430
Will we ever defeat the bounty hunter?

807
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,110
Will we ever do my job?

808
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,610
And actually hunt some bounties?

809
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,250
Yeah, I will.

810
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,610
No.

811
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,340
Last final episode.

812
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,460
Will Doki do her job?

813
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,700
And hunt bounties?

814
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,420
I'm not going to be the bounty hunter.

815
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,880
Alright.

816
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,500
So, what's the plan?

817
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,260
Let's head to the royal palace.

818
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,980
Aria should be done with his meeting by now.

819
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,000
I wonder if they managed to change the king's mind.

820
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,440
I wonder if they managed to change the king's mind.

821
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,040
I'll set him straight myself if he's still finding excuses.

822
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,440
Alright, kill him over here!

823
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,020
You're General Shiva!

824
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,620
It's an honor to meet you!

825
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,200
Yeah, that's me.

826
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,040
The tiny little guy here.

827
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,420
I don't go by.

828
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,520
Never mind.

829
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,220
Who's talking?

830
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,620
Is he coming out of my voice?

831
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,000
Yes, sir!

832
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,360
Where's actual General Shiva?

833
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:27,200
Your majesty, please give me permission to fully mobilize the army.

834
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,480
Do I have to?

835
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,080
Are you sure you really need to go that far?

836
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,340
Supreme Commander Zeyu was able to keep them at bay all this time with just the border patrol.

837
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,800
The situation has changed.

838
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,640
Now, I'm going to go back.

839
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,460
Yeah, but that's because he was working in line with him.

840
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,000
Hmm...

841
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,260
But still...

842
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:55,420
If the royal capital falls, don't you know your head will be the first to roll?

843
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
General Shiva!

844
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,260
What are you doing here?

845
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,840
That's right!

846
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,460
I'm backing up General Aria.

847
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:04,920
Yeah!

848
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,780
I'm here too.

849
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,820
Yeah, that's me!

850
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,660
Yeah, okay bro.

851
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,080
I exist.

852
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,540
What is the meaning of this General Aria?

853
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,580
Don't tell me!

854
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,040
Have you joined forces with the demons to steal control of the country?

855
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,840
This is why we abolish monarchy because we have people like him in power.

856
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,200
The only people trying to do that are the ones claiming to reactivate Garam.

857
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,240
Just because he's like the son of somebody.

858
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,340
The forest land army!

859
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,620
The

860
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,060
princess of forest land, Anne.

861
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,880
Princess of?

862
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,040
Princess of?

863
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,100
Princess of?

864
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,900
Princess of?

865
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,940
I now fight as a member of the resistance, aiming to strip...

866
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,540
I wonder how much...

867
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,080
Shh!

868
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,580
You're not supposed to talk about the inbreeding part.

869
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,240
Maybe look at our...

870
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,620
I should say that.

871
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,140
Maybe I might get like...

872
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,800
I should talk about the inbreeding part.

873
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,760
The current monarchy systems.

874
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,580
In other words, she's the enemy of our enemy.

875
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,560
And you know what they say about them.

876
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,420
They're telling me this enemy of our enemy.

877
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,200
And the traitor general Sheeva.

878
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,700
And the demons who overthrew my army's commander.

879
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,500
Are all on our side?

880
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,900
Yeah!

881
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,420
I just don't know anymore.

882
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,460
You're not supposed to think, King.

883
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,180
You're literally a puppet for the army.

884
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,880
Zeyu is gone.

885
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,120
You're not his puppet anymore.

886
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,420
You're our puppet.

887
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,840
Please.

888
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,800
Stand up for your country.

889
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,760
And become a king for people to be proud of.

890
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,540
I'm sorry.

891
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,420
I met in-game guys.

892
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,360
Abolish the monarchy in-game.

893
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,800
Everything I say is in-game.

894
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,380
It doesn't apply to real life.

895
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,600
Disclaimer.

896
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,000
Royal blood won't protect you either.

897
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,640
You could end up on the gallows.

898
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:07,940
It's okay.

899
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,840
It's a sadland vibe.

900
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,440
They don't watch sadland.

901
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,260
We're safe.

902
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,420
We're safe!

903
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,440
We're hiding behind the Sandland Vine.

904
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:36,680
What the fuck?

905
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,800
Does he not have a queen?

906
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,480
There's a reason why you can't find a queen in Sandland.

907
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,520
Do you think Forestland is gonna be any different?

908
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,880
Alright, General RA.

909
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,280
I've graciously decided to leave everything up to you.

910
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,560
I'll do all I can.

911
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,740
Reporting in!

912
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,080
The Forestland army has crossed the border and is deploying into the southern desert as we speak.

913
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,580
Oh my god, it's coming!

914
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,000
The Forestland!

915
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,720
The Forestlanders!

916
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,020
Godspeed.

917
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,100
Them and their five tanks.

918
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,340
Thanks!

919
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,800
This will be all out war.

920
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,160
Are you ready?

921
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,420
Yeah!

922
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,500
I mean I was already killing people already in game.

923
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,140
So like, it's not gonna be any different.

924
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,380
Let's do this.

925
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,140
Yay!

926
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,700
Oh my god, five thousand!

927
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,240
Okay.

928
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,940
Nope, there has to be a faster way to get there.

929
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,120
I am not traveling five thou- Oh my gosh.

930
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,080
Thank god for fast travel, guys.

931
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,700
Thank fucking god.

932
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,780
I've spotted the Forestland army.

933
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,940
You already spotted them?

934
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,640
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

935
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,440
Thank you, thank you.

936
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,900
Hi, so nice seeing you at the Dokimi panel.

937
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,960
I was so surprised when I saw you in the artist alley.

938
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,240
I took the picture for the artist.

939
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,580
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

940
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,340
Thank you, thank you.

941
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,560
Yeah.

942
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,480
I usually... I visit the artist alley before or before or after.

943
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,860
There's so many.

944
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,040
Are these all... wait, are these all the army?

945
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,600
Oh, this has to be the army.

946
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,980
It's always fun to meet artists at the alley as well.

947
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,440
Because I love buying Dokimarch.

948
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,780
What's funny is that they always be like, can you also have anything else on the table?

949
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,740
And I was like, no, that's okay.

950
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,420
I just want myself.

951
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,840
They were like, you know, you can also request anything else here.

952
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,700
I was like, no, that's fine.

953
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
I just... I just really want me.

954
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,200
Like, that's really it.

955
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,280
Oh my god, how strong are they?

956
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,660
Oh shit.

957
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,760
Okay, these guys are super...

958
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,740
Okay, we're gonna...

959
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,940
We're gonna grab... nope.

960
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,880
Where's the... how do I grab?

961
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,920
Okay, Rad, I need you to...

962
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,640
What do you mean, chat help?

963
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,460
Okay, we're gonna have to get rid of the officer.

964
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,340
This is the officer.

965
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,740
Uh...

966
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,480
Oh my god, Nikki!

967
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,940
Thank you for the Akasupa!

968
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
You did it!

969
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,040
You created an account for your dog!

970
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:16,760
Thank you for the account for your dog!

971
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,640
Thank you for the account for your dog!

972
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,520
Thank you for the Akasupa!

973
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,080
Thank you!

974
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,240
See, guys?

975
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,200
I'm your dog's Oshi.

976
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

977
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,600
Who gave this dog a credit card?

978
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,860
Yo!

979
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,800
But also, who the fuck gave this dog a credit card?

980
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,300
He did it!

981
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,640
Nikki!

982
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,960
He's popular with the dogs.

983
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,860
Guys...

984
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,640
Figure yourself an Oshi who has...

985
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,140
dogs as fans.

986
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,560
Also cats.

987
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,600
Do cats like me too?

988
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,320
Guys, I need to know.

989
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
Do cats like me as well?

990
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,140
Okay, let's grab...

991
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,380
the bike.

992
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,540
Our very under level bike.

993
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,240
I trust Nikki with my finances.

994
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,720
Alright.

995
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,880
Is this the right one?

996
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,060
No, we have to find the one that has no name tag.

997
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,640
This one.

998
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,200
This is the officer.

999
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,880
Alright, no wonder he hits so hard.

1000
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,460
Whoa!

1001
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,860
Thanks for taking it!

1002
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, that's awkward!

1003
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,560
That is so awkward!

1004
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,340
Alright.

1005
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,880
Don't worry, we'll tell your wife!

1006
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,880
We'll tell your wife while I'm in bed with her that you died honorably!

1007
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,500
Okay, let's get rid of him.

1008
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,560
And then reload.

1009
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,300
And then reload.

1010
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,880
Alright, man down!

1011
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,380
Man down!

1012
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,540
Wait, what?

1013
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:53,980
What huh?

1014
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,180
Alright.

1015
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,360
Nice.

1016
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,040
Uh, that should be everybody.

1017
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,940
Right?

1018
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,240
Alright.

1019
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,160
Still two more.

1020
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,460
Oh shit, he died?

1021
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,520
What happened?

1022
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,500
Who's dying?

1023
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,460
What do you mean?

1024
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,420
I'm doing everywhere.

1025
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,600
I'm doing everywhere.

1026
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:18,960
Everything.

1027
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,480
I can.

1028
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,420
Let's take out their army's brain.

1029
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:24,820
Okay.

1030
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,300
That's fine.

1031
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,880
That's what I've been doing this entire time.

1032
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,300
Alright.

1033
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,740
This is so easy.

1034
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,080
Okay.

1035
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,400
It's fine.

1036
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,740
They're almost dead.

1037
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:37,900
Oh!

1038
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,400
He's holding still for me.

1039
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,220
Oh nice!

1040
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,740
It's okay!

1041
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,420
They're level 18?

1042
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,120
Okay, I think my tank's also level 18 though to be fair.

1043
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:49,940
Now they don't know what to do.

1044
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,580
Their brain's dead.

1045
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,720
Alright.

1046
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,060
Nice.

1047
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,000
Then we got Royload.

1048
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,420
Oh my god.

1049
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,880
What kind of army is this?

1050
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,160
When is dad gonna get a YouTube channel so NikiDodago can finally watch the stream?

1051
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,480
Thank you for the super chat, Dark.

1052
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:07,900
Thank you.

1053
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,460
Thank you.

1054
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:08,660
No.

1055
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,340
No.

1056
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:09,840
I'm sharing.

1057
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,780
Dad and I are sharing a channel together.

1058
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,460
We don't wanna split the subs.

1059
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,260
We're gonna do this.

1060
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,380
We're gonna do this.

1061
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,460
Yeah, imagine if I hadn't upgraded the tank.

1062
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,080
Yeah, that would've been really awkward.

1063
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,380
Thank god.

1064
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,700
Thank god I upgraded the tank, guys.

1065
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,180
That was my idea, chat, to upgrade the tank.

1066
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,380
Ooh!

1067
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:38,820
Okay.

1068
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,140
I alerted the guards.

1069
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,400
Which one's the tank?

1070
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:41,960
The brain.

1071
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,160
Nope.

1072
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,340
Is this one?

1073
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,120
It has to be this one.

1074
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,680
Right?

1075
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,460
Are you the brain?

1076
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,160
Yeah, you are.

1077
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,040
Oh!

1078
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,200
I caught you!

1079
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,200
I caught you!

1080
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,240
I knew it.

1081
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,560
I fucking see you.

1082
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,560
You thought you could pretend to be just like the other tanks?

1083
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,060
You forest landers.

1084
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,680
I'm not that stupid.

1085
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,580
I might be from Sandland, but I'm not that stupid.

1086
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,940
Thank you for the five gifted chips.

1087
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,320
Thank you.

1088
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:18,840
Thank you.

1089
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,080
Okay, that's good that we have the others.

1090
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,280
Oh, Link, thank you for the super chat.

1091
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,620
Thank you.

1092
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,140
Thank you!

1093
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,420
Hi, Toki.

1094
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,840
Glad to be part of the crowd at one of your karaoke appearances.

1095
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,840
Funny that I ended up being all the way over in Germany of all places.

1096
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,900
Thank you for the super chat.

1097
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,280
Thank you.

1098
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,840
Thank you.

1099
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,380
Oh my god!

1100
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,120
Is that you?

1101
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,880
You have the profile picture!

1102
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,180
Wait, there's more?

1103
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,000
How is there more?

1104
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,360
Okay.

1105
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,900
I can't believe there's so many tanks.

1106
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,340
It's like a whole entire army.

1107
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,980
Who would've thought?

1108
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,880
Wait, can I just go here?

1109
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,680
Would I fail my mission if I...

1110
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,960
No, I didn't.

1111
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,540
Okay, thank god.

1112
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,200
That would've been awkward.

1113
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:14,300
Did I mess up?

1114
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,700
Joining forces...

1115
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,460
Did I mess up?

1116
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,260
Oh my god, did I left?

1117
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,200
Oh, okay.

1118
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,520
Okay, that's good.

1119
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,900
That's fine.

1120
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,360
I was like...

1121
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,040
I was so worried.

1122
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,200
I was like, oh my god, should I fuck up the...

1123
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,860
more... Did I fuck up the mission because I left?

1124
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,740
Because I fast traveled?

1125
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,920
Oh, yeah!

1126
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,220
Oh shit, that's a big tank!

1127
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,680
Where's our big tank?

1128
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,360
Oh...

1129
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,900
There's so many wives to go to bed with.

1130
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,940
To tell them that their husband died honorably.

1131
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,310
...

1132
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:17,670
...

1133
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,530
...

1134
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:20,690
...

1135
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,070
...

1136
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,510
Tell you what?

1137
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,320
Oh my god, he fits in the tank!

1138
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,320
He brought like 4 tanks.

1139
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,060
I don't know if that's going to help.

1140
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,860
...

1141
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,620
...

1142
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,120
He's leading Seiyuu's elite guard into battle!

1143
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,460
That's the king?

1144
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,680
To think he would make a personal appearance on the front lines.

1145
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,520
You call that fit?

1146
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,280
He's stuck.

1147
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,120
...

1148
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,660
But don't kill them!

1149
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,040
Take the king alive!

1150
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,260
Ha!

1151
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,600
Oh my god.

1152
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,860
All I'm saying is that like...

1153
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,020
What the fuck?

1154
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,840
It's like... Holy shit, you just got run over the other tank!

1155
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,600
Okay, I'm as close as I can be.

1156
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,400
I don't know...

1157
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,540
Oh shit.

1158
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,360
Oh shit.

1159
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,880
It like fucking lagged my tank at one point!

1160
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,000
...

1161
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,080
My tank started lagging when he started firing!

1162
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,580
It's just too big!

1163
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,380
...

1164
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,340
Oh, I don't know.

1165
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,260
This is a big tank!

1166
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,600
Oh no!

1167
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:42,900
Oh!

1168
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,440
Guys, I don't know guys.

1169
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,960
I don't know anymore.

1170
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,800
I have to give it every shot!

1171
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,040
Holy shit!

1172
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,620
Bro, please!

1173
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,120
I need help!

1174
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,200
I need assistance!

1175
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,580
Wait, what?

1176
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,060
Did I do it?

1177
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,880
She was like half HP!

1178
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,980
And then she gave up?

1179
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,240
... What a cow!

1180
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,580
You running away after half HP?

1181
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,480
Couldn't be me.

1182
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,480
...

1183
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:19,540
...

1184
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:21,940
...

1185
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,600
...

1186
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,050
There's a phase two?

1187
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:30,770
Just like Souls?

1188
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,570
...

1189
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,270
...

1190
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,450
...

1191
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,730
He did what he was stuck!

1192
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:42,550
...

1193
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,330
How did he get in?

1194
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:45,830
...

1195
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:49,450
The rest is up to you, General RA!

1196
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,650
Okay, bye!

1197
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:56,610
... Someone oil him up!

1198
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:57,230
...

1199
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:57,590
...

1200
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,250
...

1201
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,250
Get the plunger!

1202
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,450
Get the king plunger!

1203
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:09,570
Oh my god!

1204
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,790
All three of them!

1205
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,230
It's so threatening!

1206
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:14,610
...

1207
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,120
Get the plunger!

1208
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,440
Oh!

1209
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,180
...

1210
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,780
Is he okay?

1211
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,000
...

1212
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,040
Or do you have a wife?

1213
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,820
...

1214
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,320
...

1215
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,070
...

1216
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:36,850
...

1217
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,210
There's not even blood!

1218
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,970
How is he badly wounded?

1219
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,490
...

1220
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:47,310
...

1221
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,070
...

1222
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,190
...

1223
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,990
...

1224
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,230
...

1225
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,330
...

1226
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:54,670
...

1227
00:50:54,670 --> 00:51:10,990
Oh my god!

1228
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:11,290
...

1229
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:11,350
...

1230
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,970
...

1231
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:16,130
...

1232
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,390
...

1233
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,790
I...

1234
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,690
...

1235
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:26,790
I...

1236
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,330
That was my puppet!

1237
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,890
I'm gonna control an army!

1238
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,010
Yeah, isn't there like a chain of command?

1239
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,210
Doesn't he have a second in command?

1240
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:48,810
I feel bad for his second in command and he's just like, this is it, this is my time to finally show the military what I'm made of.

1241
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:52,190
I'm gonna prove myself to General Arya!

1242
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:58,510
And then he's like, to this old man that's retired 50 years ago, you can be the new commander.

1243
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,930
This is a strategic withdrawal!

1244
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,390
Our priority is to minimize casualties!

1245
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,950
True, I mean he is the legend.

1246
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,830
And then some old guy shoves you outside.

1247
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:17,370
He's like, what was it, Conan O'Brien and that other guy?

1248
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,450
Everyone, stop here!

1249
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,130
Are you sure, General?

1250
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,170
We're highly visible here.

1251
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:30,810
It's alright.

1252
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,490
Jay Leno!

1253
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,270
Yeah, he's like, Jay Leno, step aside!

1254
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,830
I'm coming back!

1255
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,790
That's right, our eyes are trained in Sandland.

1256
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,230
Yeah, that's right, forest landers.

1257
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:59,190
You didn't have the sun because you had your trees covering it all.

1258
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,790
You got spoiled by your trees.

1259
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,710
What happened?

1260
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,150
Did you copy?

1261
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,450
Or you hit?

1262
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,250
They got the cannon's base in suspension.

1263
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,510
Pinned out of action!

1264
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,970
Weak forest lander eyes.

1265
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,590
They... don't

1266
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:30,960
worry.

1267
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,620
We're overwhelming them with sheer force!

1268
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,720
What, two?

1269
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,240
That's two?

1270
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,300
We have three!

1271
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,720
Also, I would've... yeah, I was gonna say, why did he not give the soldiers sunglasses?

1272
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,260
Holy shit!

1273
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,000
When did my tank go so fast?

1274
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,410
It's David versus Goliath.

1275
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,870
That's enough, Rosetta!

1276
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:14,750
Anne!

1277
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,410
Is this your idea of justice?

1278
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,370
As if an ally of demons has the right to speak of justice!

1279
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:21,250
Yeah!

1280
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:21,810
You've got it wrong!

1281
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,190
They're not the monsters you think they are at all!

1282
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,030
Just your half-demons!

1283
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,450
I'm a half demon!

1284
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:27,650
Yeah!

1285
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:28,410
Oh my gosh!

1286
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:28,950
Oh shit!

1287
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,250
I said that as a joke!

1288
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,790
Oh my gosh, she's pretty racist!

1289
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,310
We can resolve this if you'll just talk to us!

1290
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,790
Keep your naive ideals in your...

1291
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:38,230
Whoa!

1292
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:39,770
This is a battlefield!

1293
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,770
Take this!

1294
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,890
Darn this oversized tank!

1295
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,350
Actual racism!

1296
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:50,230
Oh my god!

1297
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,310
Anne... I want it.

1298
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,520
Is that it?

1299
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,740
Am I just gonna run away?

1300
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,140
Fighter!

1301
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,740
What's Ari's condition?

1302
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,000
When did he fucking die?

1303
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,700
No way!

1304
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:22,440
Yeah!

1305
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,200
I was like, what?

1306
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,400
Get a hold of yourself!

1307
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,240
He's gonna get into a coma!

1308
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,120
What do you mean he won't wake up?

1309
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,460
He just had a chest wound!

1310
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,300
How did that affect the brain?

1311
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,020
Like...

1312
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,400
Like...

1313
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,400
How did that travel all the way to the mind?

1314
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,660
Like...

1315
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,680
This guy's snoring!

1316
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,080
I don't want B-R-O-C-L-O-C!

1317
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:46,740
I'm really tired!

1318
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,280
Okay, where am I supposed to go?

1319
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,660
Guys, B-R-O-C-L-O-C!

1320
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,520
Hahaha!

1321
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,380
Okay, I go back.

1322
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,900
Just a chest wound.

1323
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,760
Should we go back and help Ari?

1324
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,840
No, let's just sleep.

1325
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,480
It's alright.

1326
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,620
He's still in a coma.

1327
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,400
It doesn't matter.

1328
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,660
He'll wake up eventually.

1329
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,220
Stay.

1330
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,380
Please, make yourselves at home.

1331
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,000
It's alright.

1332
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,600
He's in a coma.

1333
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,080
He'll wake up, right?

1334
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,360
Alright, I'm gonna eat my lunch while we're waiting for him to wake up from his coma.

1335
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,200
I hope you're well rested.

1336
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,460
We look forward to your next visit.

1337
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:36,840
Yeah!

1338
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:39,980
Alright.

1339
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,920
I gotta head over.

1340
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,360
Guys, he's gonna wake up, right?

1341
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,680
Right?

1342
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,900
He's gonna wake up, guys!

1343
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,200
I didn't realize he went into a goddamn coma.

1344
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,840
But he's gonna wake up.

1345
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:56,950
Alright, let us in.

1346
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,110
You know why I'm here.

1347
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:06,990
Wait,

1348
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,510
is he awake?

1349
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,850
Wait, you're back up?

1350
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,210
I thought you were in a coma!

1351
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:24,930
Wow.

1352
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:24,930
Ew.

1353
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,530
We're freaking shot.

1354
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:31,810
He was just eepy!

1355
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,210
Oh, a little tea and tea, like that, can stop me.

1356
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,940
Fighting on through sheer willpower will come back to bite you later.

1357
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,860
Look, it's nothing that I can't handle, alright?

1358
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,480
Ah, to be young.

1359
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,340
All joking aside, though.

1360
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,940
What's the prawn business?

1361
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,860
What the fuck?

1362
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,920
It's been a day!

1363
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,640
How did they build three bases?

1364
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,620
That's so fast!

1365
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,500
That makes sense.

1366
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:21,860
Yeah.

1367
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,180
That makes sense.

1368
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,880
But like they built three in a day?

1369
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,260
It's not fair to have trees.

1370
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,080
They brought their goddamn trees to build those bases.

1371
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,420
What do you mean on a losing streak?

1372
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,860
We fucking killed so many people.

1373
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,100
Okay, what do we need?

1374
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,980
New parts can be made at the base.

1375
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,300
We need to join forces.

1376
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,620
We need to...

1377
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,660
Okay, these are all the bases.

1378
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,400
I'm gonna see if I can upgrade.

1379
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,340
I'm gonna check if we can upgrade anything.

1380
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,600
Kick out the force land squatters!

1381
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,300
Thank you for the super chat!

1382
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,280
Thank you, thank you!

1383
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:22,780
No name!

1384
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:24,560
Alright.

1385
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,860
We're gonna... We're gonna see if we can upgrade our tank.

1386
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,420
Mmm.

1387
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,520
Do you need any?

1388
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:38,580
Mm-hmm.

1389
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:44,010
Let's see.

1390
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:46,130
Dragoons.

1391
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:50,870
Let's see.

1392
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:55,010
What do we need for premium steel and premium bulk?

1393
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,710
I'm pretty sure I can make those, right?

1394
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,050
Just go all in on the tank at this point.

1395
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:00,950
Hahaha!

1396
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:07,150
I feel like... I feel like we can just go all in on getting better tanks.

1397
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:08,850
Alright, let's see.

1398
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,250
Attack, um...

1399
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:16,050
Okay, we don't have new parts, but I think we can upgrade our parts, right?

1400
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,970
Premium steel, premium meter, premium gunpowder.

1401
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:20,230
Alright.

1402
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:20,810
See you later!

1403
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,250
We gotta go to the parts lady.

1404
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,350
Parts lady!

1405
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,110
Oh my god!

1406
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,850
Master drop!

1407
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,850
Thank you for the 50 gifted ships!

1408
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,050
Thank you, thank you!

1409
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:30,550
Thank you!

1410
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,390
Really appreciate it!

1411
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,690
Alright, where's the premium shit?

1412
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,330
Do you not have premium stuff?

1413
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:37,870
Bro, what the fuck?

1414
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,870
Give me back my...

1415
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,370
Give me back my...

1416
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:43,710
Thank you!

1417
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:43,950
Bro!

1418
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,090
Bob was better.

1419
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:52,350
The forest landers had premium stuff!

1420
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:54,570
Hey!

1421
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,290
Is it... oh!

1422
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,290
Oh, nice.

1423
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:57,470
I got... ooh!

1424
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:58,610
Oh, wait!

1425
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,030
Isn't this really good?

1426
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:00,530
Wait, wait, wait!

1427
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,130
Which one was good?

1428
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:07,010
Remember you guys told me to... um... get some of their gun stuff?

1429
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,410
Which one was good?

1430
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,070
Purple guns?

1431
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:13,970
Yeah, but which one?

1432
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,070
Can we get the EMP gun and laser?

1433
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,690
Okay, we're gonna grab that.

1434
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,350
And then we're gonna grab that.

1435
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:25,890
Alright.

1436
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,590
Bring me any rare items you find.

1437
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:29,230
Alright, let's see.

1438
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,810
Let's see how good the parts are though.

1439
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:37,390
I heard like... you guys were saying that the guns and lasers were really good from the cat guy.

1440
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:38,990
From Najin Boo.

1441
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:41,390
Parts...

1442
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:44,230
Uh, customized vehicle...

1443
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:46,750
Uh...

1444
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:48,970
Oh, you got EMP gun?

1445
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:51,910
Wait, but then the damage isn't as good though.

1446
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,550
The damage is so low!

1447
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,310
Is it worth it?

1448
01:01:58,770 --> 01:01:59,890
Is it worth it?

1449
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:00,930
Or nah?

1450
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,050
Um... lower damage, but...

1451
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,390
Uh...

1452
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,210
Is it worth it though?

1453
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:11,570
Guys?

1454
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,770
Or should I keep...

1455
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,210
Maybe upgrade?

1456
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,850
Damage isn't everything...

1457
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:20,830
DAMAGE IS EVERYTHING!

1458
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

1459
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,270
DAMAGE IS EVERYTHING!

1460
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:32,930
Okay, we'll try it.

1461
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,010
What world do you live in?

1462
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,870
Where you think damage isn't everything?

1463
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,410
Also, what else did I buy?

1464
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:41,970
I don't remember what else...

1465
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,250
What else did I buy?

1466
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:44,690
Other than this...

1467
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,150
I don't remember...

1468
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,030
For what...

1469
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,690
Where did the laser go?

1470
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,870
Wait, which tank uses the laser?

1471
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,150
Because clearly it's not any of this...

1472
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:03,870
Big number makes unga bunga brain happy.

1473
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:06,370
Oh, it's in...

1474
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,110
Which one is the...

1475
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:09,950
Which one was the laser?

1476
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:12,050
Oh, the laser was the mecha?

1477
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,450
Was this?

1478
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:16,090
No, it wasn't.

1479
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,850
Which one was the laser?

1480
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,430
Where the fuck?

1481
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,430
Where did I buy the laser for?

1482
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,460
The hover one?

1483
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,260
Was it the hover?

1484
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,500
What the fuck?

1485
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,780
I don't remember which gun was for the laser.

1486
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,160
It's check under options?

1487
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,680
Okay, options.

1488
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,220
Okay, wait, what options?

1489
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,400
Wait, I'm confused.

1490
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,880
It's an option part?

1491
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,020
Oh, okay.

1492
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,280
It's an option part.

1493
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,680
What does that mean?

1494
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:00,800
Oh, here.

1495
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:01,340
Oh!

1496
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:01,580
Oh!

1497
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,420
Virus of power was causing destructive.

1498
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:05,680
You know what?

1499
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,040
Fuck it, let's go.

1500
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,520
Damage!

1501
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,360
All in!

1502
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,300
And then we upgrade part.

1503
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,140
Apparently, okay, we need...

1504
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:19,420
Where the fuck are we getting premium meter and premium steel?

1505
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,360
We do not have either of those.

1506
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:28,800
I guess we have to... I'm gonna go visit...

1507
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,180
I guess I have to visit.

1508
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,940
I guess I have to visit, like, the other side.

1509
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,040
You're right.

1510
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,580
Who needs armor when you have laser?

1511
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,760
We need, like, premium steel.

1512
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,360
We need to go to... here?

1513
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,100
These guys might have it.

1514
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,360
The junker market might have it.

1515
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,560
Does he sell it?

1516
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,160
Armor up.

1517
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,700
No, he doesn't sell it.

1518
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,320
Do you sell it?

1519
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,940
Do you sell it?

1520
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,840
Do you make the good shit?

1521
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:06,840
You do!

1522
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,300
Okay, that's good.

1523
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,360
Okay, we're gonna grab all of the premium...

1524
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:10,640
What is it?

1525
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,480
Premium steel and premium bolt, right?

1526
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,700
Okay, we need...

1527
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,360
A lot of premium steel.

1528
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,160
And then we need...

1529
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,820
Premium bolt, right?

1530
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,020
How many premium bolts do we need?

1531
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,070
I don't remember.

1532
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:31,510
Oh my god, this guy...

1533
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,070
Why can't I have him in my town?

1534
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:34,770
Why?

1535
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,710
Why can't he live with us?

1536
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:45,070
I'm gonna have four premium bolts just in case.

1537
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,890
Yeah, like, we don't need...

1538
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,750
We don't need...

1539
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,710
What's her name?

1540
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:50,530
Workshop lady?

1541
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,690
This is better workshop lady.

1542
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:54,550
Kidnapping.

1543
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:57,710
Alright, let's see.

1544
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,850
I actually don't remember what we needed, so I'm gonna double check.

1545
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,070
Two plus two is five, right?

1546
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:04,450
I don't know!

1547
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,070
I don't remember!

1548
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:05,510
I don't remember!

1549
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:08,350
Alright.

1550
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,230
Because I want to upgrade my laser.

1551
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,490
Alright, parts.

1552
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:14,550
Upgrade part.

1553
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:17,730
Okay, we need premium meter.

1554
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,710
Okay.

1555
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,050
We have Justin...

1556
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,310
Premium meter?

1557
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:23,930
Oh shit, okay.

1558
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,510
Premium meter?

1559
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,130
Alright, we got...

1560
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:32,530
Well, I hope that they're not gonna be using my premium steel to make the premium meter.

1561
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,090
Because that would be very...

1562
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:34,910
Uh...

1563
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:35,650
Very awkward.

1564
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,150
Get the A-N drive?

1565
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,890
What the fuck is your...

1566
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:42,090
What the fuck is it?

1567
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:42,950
A-N drive?

1568
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,830
Uh...

1569
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,350
Oh, nope.

1570
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:46,990
We gotta go here.

1571
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,490
And then...

1572
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:52,210
Talk to premium meter.

1573
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,530
Oh god, I hope...

1574
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:54,370
Wait, how many...

1575
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:54,670
I forgot!

1576
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,490
How many do I need to get for the premium meter?

1577
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,230
Premium meter.

1578
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,090
Guys, it goes in one ear and out the other.

1579
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,630
Guys, it doesn't matter.

1580
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:05,790
They don't have premium meter.

1581
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:07,470
What the fuck is a premium meter?

1582
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,710
How do you not have premium meter?

1583
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:12,930
I don't know what it is, but how do you not have premium meter?

1584
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,550
Where do I get premium meter?

1585
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:19,130
The forest land workshop would have premium meter.

1586
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:25,290
They drop from enemies?

1587
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:26,950
What kind of enemies?

1588
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:31,330
Maybe...

1589
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,390
What kind of enemies drop meters?

1590
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:37,710
What the fuck?

1591
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:38,290
What do you mean?

1592
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:38,870
Is it meter?

1593
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,220
It's a meter but premium.

1594
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,520
Bob would have had a premium.

1595
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,360
Do you have a premium meter?

1596
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,240
What kind of enemies drop premium meter?

1597
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,960
One meter equal.

1598
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,460
A unit of measurement.

1599
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,780
Okay, this is not...

1600
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,340
Okay, this is not the right gun.

1601
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:13,540
Boom!

1602
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,940
Oh, that is overkill.

1603
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:17,720
Okay.

1604
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:19,760
Nice.

1605
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,240
Oh, I got premium gear!

1606
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,440
Alright, are these all the bad guys here?

1607
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,680
Wait, that was it?

1608
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,620
No, I just went the wrong way.

1609
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,100
Nevermind.

1610
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,500
They weren't even part of the enemies.

1611
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,380
Okay, sorry.

1612
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,440
I went the wrong way.

1613
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:44,540
Thank you, Zeon, for the backseating.

1614
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,920
I really appreciate it.

1615
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,820
Queenie, what is it?

1616
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,040
I thought you were Canadian.

1617
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,320
Okay.

1618
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,880
Oh my god, it's splashing.

1619
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,360
Okay.

1620
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,480
Apparently, there is the forest land officer here somewhere.

1621
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,480
Is it this guy?

1622
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,520
Oh, it is this guy.

1623
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:13,860
It's okay.

1624
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,040
Laser is coming in.

1625
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,800
Oh my god, he can block too?

1626
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,860
That should be illegal!

1627
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:22,900
Oh god.

1628
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:27,040
Don't worry.

1629
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,820
Don't worry, he can block all of this.

1630
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:30,280
Oh!

1631
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,600
Wait, that damage is insane.

1632
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:32,940
Insane!

1633
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,360
Wait a minute!

1634
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,080
That's some insane damage right there!

1635
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,540
Holy shit, alright.

1636
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,420
And then we...

1637
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:43,880
We get like...

1638
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,920
Wait, that is insane.

1639
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:47,760
Alright.

1640
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,080
Do I get premium meter?

1641
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,120
Premium gear?

1642
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:50,780
Premiums...

1643
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,680
Premium meter!

1644
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:52,900
We did it!

1645
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,540
We got premium meter!

1646
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:59,680
Prize drop by, have Bramley assigned so that to get the best part, be as many enemies as you can.

1647
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,080
Legendary, rare or even higher capacity.

1648
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:03,660
Ooh!

1649
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,860
Wait, that's like legendary part.

1650
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,120
Alright.

1651
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,620
You guys don't matter apparently.

1652
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,280
So I can just shoot you guys away and steal your part here.

1653
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:18,460
Alright, nice.

1654
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,600
We finally got... We got another premium meter!

1655
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,360
Nice!

1656
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,520
Alright.

1657
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,880
That... counter offensive?

1658
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,020
Enough?

1659
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,200
Eat everybody?

1660
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,720
You know what?

1661
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,040
I'm gonna defeat these guys for the premium meters.

1662
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,440
We actually need upgrades.

1663
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,420
Like...

1664
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,660
It might be... It actually might be a good idea to...

1665
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,000
To kill these guys for like some upgrades now.

1666
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,420
Alright.

1667
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:52,460
Is that everybody?

1668
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,580
Did I do it?

1669
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,520
This is counter offensive.

1670
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:58,720
What does that mean?

1671
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,380
What does that mean?

1672
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,060
I'm gonna kill everybody.

1673
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,060
Finally.

1674
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,000
I finally learned what a meter was!

1675
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,660
Is that it?

1676
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,160
Use LBRT.

1677
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,380
LBRT?

1678
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,200
Oh!

1679
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,080
I see it.

1680
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,940
I think I'm pretty sure I killed everybody.

1681
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:28,760
Right?

1682
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:31,560
Hello.

1683
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:31,920
No.

1684
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,180
Because it keeps telling me to go back.

1685
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,000
What?

1686
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,680
Who's still alive?!

1687
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,720
Who's still alive?!

1688
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,000
Who's still alive?!

1689
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,320
Who's still alive and do you have a way for me to tell that you were a hero?

1690
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,840
You should check the map...

1691
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,220
Oh, there they are.

1692
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:49,860
Oh, okay.

1693
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:50,420
Yeah.

1694
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,460
I did not realize...

1695
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,160
Okay.

1696
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,580
You know what?

1697
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,260
I'm gonna...

1698
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,000
Oh, wait.

1699
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:56,920
Oh, he's already dead.

1700
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,240
Don't even believe this.

1701
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,760
Look, all I'm saying is that I will make sure that your family knows you were a hero.

1702
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:11,780
Premium meter?

1703
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,040
Ooh, scorpion oil.

1704
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,060
Why are you doing all that scorpion oil over there?

1705
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,180
Can I rob you guys?

1706
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,360
Is there stuff to steal?

1707
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,440
Nope.

1708
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,000
Nope.

1709
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,360
Okay.

1710
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,340
Alright, it's time to go back to Spino!

1711
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,600
The wife hunter.

1712
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,980
There's a bounty on your what?

1713
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:38,460
Oh wow, I can't believe there's a bounty on you, sir.

1714
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,520
Alright, let's see.

1715
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,140
Upgrade part.

1716
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,900
Oh my god, finally.

1717
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,800
Okay, premium gunpowder.

1718
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,340
Okay, I think I can also...

1719
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,520
Customize vehicle.

1720
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,520
Can upgrade dragoons, right?

1721
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:58,720
Vehicle.

1722
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,600
Upgrade vehicle.

1723
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,260
I need premium steel.

1724
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,960
I need one more premium steel.

1725
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,160
Oh, I don't have premium ore.

1726
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,340
I don't know where to find premium ore.

1727
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,220
There's so many premium!

1728
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,320
Oh, I'm saying... What do you mean it's bad?

1729
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,340
I'll have you know I'm the Coco Melon of the world.

1730
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:26,040
I'll have you know I'm the Coco Melon of the world.

1731
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:26,120
I'll have you know I'm the Coco Melon of the world.

1732
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:29,280
Okay, let's see.

1733
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,240
Ugh.

1734
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,980
I have no checkpoint around here.

1735
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,880
Holy sh**.

1736
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,120
I actually don't...

1737
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,720
I never went to the Hidden...

1738
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:40,740
It's hidden!

1739
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,640
How was I supposed to know where the Hidden Cliff Village was?

1740
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:49,140
I was supposed to know where the Hidden Cliff Village was.

1741
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,280
Not the...

1742
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:51,940
Here we go!

1743
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:53,740
Cocomelonavity, please.

1744
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:57,280
Yoki, you're not supposed to say that as a positive thing!

1745
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,380
Okay.

1746
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,320
What's this?

1747
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,320
Get the flowers?

1748
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:04,680
No.

1749
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,800
I don't care about this child's flowers.

1750
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,260
I gotta figure out how to get here.

1751
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,560
You could look for it.

1752
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,960
But like, I don't know what type of ores that is.

1753
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,000
There's so many ores around me!

1754
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,640
They could be bad ores!

1755
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,420
Oh, is this where the flowers are?

1756
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,900
Yoki Melon, the brain rot is real!

1757
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,580
Gab, they give us...

1758
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,040
It's a demon!

1759
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,280
Yeah!

1760
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,160
She's blind for a blind girl!

1761
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,240
For a child!

1762
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,840
Oh, Naki.

1763
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:50,760
Oh, Naki.

1764
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:10,300
Okay, but why is he bringing flowers to a blind child?

1765
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,120
That's not a twist.

1766
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,820
But why do that for a human?

1767
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,140
Yeah.

1768
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,340
She complimented my singing.

1769
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,940
What the fuck?

1770
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:27,860
How old are...

1771
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,540
First off, Naka, how old are you?

1772
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:37,340
I was walking along, humming to myself, when suddenly, I heard clapping.

1773
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,120
When I looked around, there she was.

1774
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,620
She said I was good.

1775
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,560
Are you that good a singer?

1776
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,780
I like to sing, but no, I'm not very good.

1777
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,820
But she still thanked me.

1778
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,640
She said interesting scents and sounds make her happy.

1779
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,340
So you've been bringing her flowers?

1780
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,040
I wanted her to enjoy their scent.

1781
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,720
That's pretty sweet.

1782
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,580
Why not just sing for her if she's sure you're good?

1783
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:08,120
Yeah.

1784
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,600
I can't.

1785
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,420
She won't be happy anymore.

1786
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,400
She's literally blind!

1787
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,320
She doesn't know the concept of demons!

1788
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,240
I'm not so sure about that.

1789
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,160
She doesn't even know what they look like!

1790
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:19,980
Cause she's blind!

1791
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,620
She was looking for you so she could thank you.

1792
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,120
What?

1793
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,560
I don't need her to.

1794
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:26,840
Once was enough.

1795
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,180
Never mind that.

1796
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,440
Prince, I have a request.

1797
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:32,960
What?

1798
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,100
What is it?

1799
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,920
The thing is, I want some alpha raptor essence.

1800
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,160
What the fuck do you want with al- You want me to be an alpha?

1801
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:42,380
What for?

1802
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,820
I need it to make a cure for her sight.

1803
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:49,620
What?

1804
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,320
But I'm not strong enough to defeat an alpha raptor.

1805
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,460
You could cure her sight using that essence?

1806
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,440
What?

1807
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:00,520
Where did we get there?

1808
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:04,220
First off, it was just bring flowers to a girl that would compliment you.

1809
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,460
And now you're like, I'm gonna cure her blindness now.

1810
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:08,520
Yeah.

1811
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,160
Alright, we'll see to it.

1812
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:12,560
Yeah.

1813
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,680
Is that okay with you, Prince?

1814
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,400
Guys, this is why you need to compliment people more.

1815
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:18,960
Like, what the fuck?

1816
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,580
This guy is deprived of compliments.

1817
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,480
He's- He got one compliment and now he's gonna fix the blind.

1818
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:27,720
You mean it?

1819
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:28,540
Great.

1820
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,800
If you- What if the next person you compliment cures cancer because of you?

1821
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,100
There's an alpha raptor west of here.

1822
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,740
You just have to beat it.

1823
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,300
West.

1824
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,420
Got it.

1825
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,440
Thanks.

1826
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,680
I'll get the other ingredients in the meantime.

1827
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:48,740
What?

1828
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,000
They already killed one already.

1829
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,240
Wait, where did he go?

1830
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,800
Pretty sure I ha- I've- I've killed so many dinos.

1831
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,820
I haven't?

1832
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,800
Wait, I actually haven't killed a raptor?

1833
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,280
Oh my god.

1834
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,060
I am like...

1835
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,700
I think I'm losing my touch.

1836
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,420
You mean I didn't kill a raptor?

1837
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,040
But I killed so many!

1838
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,780
Guys, I know you're trying to compliment me, guys, but I'm not gonna be the person that's gonna cure cancer.

1839
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,380
I'm sorry.

1840
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,520
Oh shit, I forgot.

1841
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,660
This is the jump bot.

1842
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,660
God damn it!

1843
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,360
Alright, let's see.

1844
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,780
God damn it, I forgot.

1845
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,860
Sorry, that was the shoot button.

1846
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,280
I was so used to shooting.

1847
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,920
I don't remember any other buttons.

1848
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,440
Wait, would that be the premium ore?

1849
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:47,240
Maybe the premium ore is over there.

1850
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,160
But you might!

1851
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,260
Okay, guys, guys, I need you guys to stop coping here.

1852
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,780
I'm a fucking VTuber, not a doctor.

1853
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,820
Or a scientist.

1854
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,600
What does that mean?

1855
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,840
How do we get there?

1856
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,740
How do we- How do we get there?

1857
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,560
Did I go the wrong way?

1858
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,260
How do we get there?

1859
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,420
Oh, I guess I'm just gonna fuck it.

1860
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,680
I'm gonna- I jumped all the way here for no reason!

1861
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,560
I can't look at this map, man.

1862
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,420
Why is this- Okay, let's see.

1863
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,300
We gotta get out of here.

1864
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,620
And then we go this way.

1865
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,660
Alright, here we go.

1866
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,980
This map is so difficult to look at.

1867
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,680
Where are the ores?

1868
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,140
I don't understand.

1869
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:43,760
Ooh!

1870
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,460
Okay, we gotta- Oh, oh, wrong way.

1871
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:51,960
Oh, that was a cool Akira- Akira thing, but like, I need to get this.

1872
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,240
Alright, nice.

1873
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,720
Alright, off we go.

1874
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,440
Alright, time to kill more- Forest land- Sorry.

1875
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,220
I meant forest landers, guys.

1876
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,180
Not sand landers.

1877
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,000
Forest land- I fight for you guys!

1878
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,360
I fight for the people!

1879
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,240
Haha!

1880
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,820
Or like, for whichever- Whoever on me pays me more!

1881
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,400
I'm a mercenary.

1882
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,440
It's all about the money!

1883
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,640
I got the...

1884
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,840
Paternal...

1885
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,660
Rubber.

1886
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,160
Woop!

1887
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,320
Woop!

1888
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:38,700
Alright, time to swap!

1889
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,360
Gotta make the most of the journey.

1890
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,640
Here we go.

1891
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:44,480
Where's the boss?

1892
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,000
There you go.

1893
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,040
Where's big boss?

1894
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:48,980
That's right!

1895
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:51,420
I got a laser now!

1896
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,900
And it's full- Oh my god, wait!

1897
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,560
Okay, I sort of wasted that charge.

1898
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,240
Oops.

1899
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,220
I need to like, time like, the charges and stuff.

1900
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,060
Because I don't know how much charge is- How long I have to charge to get the full power.

1901
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:08,820
Come on, I know you're here.

1902
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,080
Why are you hiding behind the rock?

1903
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,300
Nice.

1904
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,660
Oh my god, he used his men!

1905
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,280
To block my charge!

1906
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:18,620
Okay.

1907
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,800
Last one.

1908
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:23,620
Phew!

1909
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:25,460
Alright.

1910
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:27,740
Now for the people.

1911
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,800
I don't know what this bike is gonna do.

1912
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,800
But okay.

1913
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,840
Are you just gonna ram into me?

1914
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,260
Okay, that's it.

1915
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,060
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

1916
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,780
Alright, that's one of them down.

1917
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,820
Oh my gosh, you guys are very brave.

1918
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:44,660
Don't worry.

1919
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,300
You guys are very brave, I'll admit.

1920
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,120
And I'm gonna steal your loot.

1921
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,540
Oh, there's so much loot!

1922
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,060
Is there any loot?

1923
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,100
Is there more loot?

1924
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,020
I love loot.

1925
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:05,820
Is there more stuff?

1926
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,420
Did you guys left this base?

1927
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,380
You built this in one day?

1928
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,400
Jesus Christ, how did they build this in one day?

1929
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,620
There's loot over there!

1930
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,340
Yeah, there's so much... so many purples.

1931
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,400
Alright, yoink.

1932
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,320
Wait, why is there like empty scrap here?

1933
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,360
Who died there?

1934
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,280
Who fucking died there?

1935
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,640
Hey, you see that raptor?

1936
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,200
Sorry.

1937
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,440
You see that raptor?

1938
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:41,920
You can help us out, worry about it.

1939
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:42,160
Bye guys.

1940
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,140
Bye.

1941
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,120
tina.

1942
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:51,840
What's happened?

1943
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,100
Bye, I'm not gonna destroy you.

1944
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:55,040
It's okay.

1945
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:01,000
You understand?

1946
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:01,340
Leave us alone.

1947
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,040
No, I don't need to kill the scorpions because like...

1948
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,080
Because like...

1949
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,240
All we need is premium shit now.

1950
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:14,560
We don't need stuff from the animals.

1951
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,160
Oh my god, look!

1952
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,320
Such a happy family!

1953
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:30,770
But we can kill this guy.

1954
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,890
Oh, it's the alpha raptor!

1955
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,130
We need to kill him anyway!

1956
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:35,090
For the essence!

1957
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:38,830
For the essence, guys!

1958
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,430
You don't understand!

1959
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:40,150
Oh shit!

1960
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:40,750
Okay.

1961
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,810
Alright, no wonder he's the alpha.

1962
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,770
Alright, there we go.

1963
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:45,430
Thanks.

1964
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,150
And then...

1965
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,110
You're a child, right?

1966
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:54,410
Yeah, that's a child.

1967
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:55,830
I gotta make sure I shoot the right one.

1968
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:57,430
Give me a sec.

1969
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:58,270
There we go.

1970
01:23:59,170 --> 01:23:59,570
Alright!

1971
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,830
Live on, childhood!

1972
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,070
You're free now!

1973
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:05,710
Childhood!

1974
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:06,430
You're free!

1975
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,870
You can do whatever you want!

1976
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:10,270
You have the whole land to yourself!

1977
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:14,390
I'm the alpha now!

1978
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,750
Alright, let's see.

1979
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:22,950
We gotta...

1980
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:23,990
Is he still chasing me?

1981
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:25,350
Look, he's having a great time!

1982
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,270
Oh shit, okay.

1983
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:29,430
That was a little overkill for these guys.

1984
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:31,710
Oh!

1985
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,470
Alright!

1986
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:36,150
Okay, you called me a monster but Beezlebub was like...

1987
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:37,590
Hey, that was fun, I guess.

1988
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:41,750
What does that say about Beezlebub?

1989
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:44,870
It's like...

1990
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:46,210
That was fun.

1991
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,530
Okay, I gotta get rid of these guys.

1992
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:54,150
Okay.

1993
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,310
Get over here.

1994
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:59,290
Get this hover fucking crap out of here.

1995
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:01,550
Get this hover crap out of here.

1996
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:02,470
Oh shit!

1997
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:03,210
Get... Whoa!

1998
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:05,830
Okay, we need a repair.

1999
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:11,570
Yeah, he's a demon that doesn't kill with exceptions.

2000
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,390
He's like, but I don't kill.

2001
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,810
But then clearly... Clearly he has exceptions!

2002
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:23,950
It's a lie!

2003
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:25,330
He does kill!

2004
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:28,350
Okay.

2005
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:30,750
Okay.

2006
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,770
I'm gonna get rid of...

2007
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:35,010
I'm gonna get rid of him and I'm gonna get rid of him.

2008
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,470
Woo!

2009
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:36,090
Ow!

2010
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:37,770
Alright, where's this guy?

2011
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:39,250
There you go.

2012
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:41,990
There you go.

2013
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:42,450
Nice.

2014
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:47,370
He only kills when it's fun.

2015
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:49,670
And I'm the monster here!

2016
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:51,410
Oh, there's the boss.

2017
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,850
There's the... There's the boss.

2018
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,190
Okay.

2019
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:55,970
I'm gonna charge this up.

2020
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:00,290
Phew!

2021
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,430
Wait, that didn't hit him?

2022
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:02,310
I'm intrigued though.

2023
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:05,210
There we go.

2024
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:05,590
Whoa!

2025
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:07,430
Okay, we gotta make sure he doesn't punch us.

2026
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:09,790
There we go.

2027
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:11,970
Ooh, look at that damage though.

2028
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:14,570
You're both monsters.

2029
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:16,170
There's no, like, distinct...

2030
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:18,890
That's not true!

2031
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,750
I'm only doing what the game's telling me to do.

2032
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,330
At best, I'm a puppet.

2033
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:24,950
Okay.

2034
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,270
I'm just a puppet.

2035
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:28,330
I'm just a puppet.

2036
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,430
I'm not free will!

2037
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,810
I'm just learning from my artificial intelligence!

2038
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:40,490
Yeah.

2039
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,850
Is that it?

2040
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:46,470
Just following orders.

2041
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:47,070
Exactly.

2042
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:52,550
There's more?

2043
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,290
Oh, we have the Sandline bases.

2044
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:54,830
Yeah.

2045
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:55,970
I almost forgot about that.

2046
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:58,310
Because we... We... We killed the Sandline.

2047
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,370
We killed the bases that are, uh...

2048
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:05,390
The bases that are, like, uh... What is it called?

2049
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:06,970
That they built themselves.

2050
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:10,110
So now we have to kill the ones that, uh, took over in Sandline.

2051
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:12,170
Alright.

2052
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,630
Yeah.

2053
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,950
Good soldiers follow orders.

2054
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:15,110
And I'm a good soldier.

2055
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:16,090
Do you need...

2056
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:19,570
Uh, let's see.

2057
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,950
Upgrade part...

2058
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:21,810
Oh, yeah.

2059
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,270
Customized vehicle.

2060
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:24,590
I got so many parts.

2061
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:29,850
Ooh!

2062
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,990
Shots exposed on impact with a chance on enemy...

2063
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:41,850
Should I just keep the EMP gun or do the purpose?

2064
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,030
I don't know.

2065
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:46,710
Fires in.

2066
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:48,510
Oh my god.

2067
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:49,450
That guy... That's too weak.

2068
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,190
Do I just... Do I just, like, stay?

2069
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:53,410
Keep the EMP?

2070
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:53,910
Okay.

2071
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,410
I'll keep the EMP then.

2072
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:56,810
Oh my god.

2073
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,290
But there's so many, like...

2074
01:27:58,290 --> 01:27:59,310
Uh...

2075
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:00,630
Let's see.

2076
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,090
Explosive lasers...

2077
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:04,470
Oh, good luck charm.

2078
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:06,030
Chip that works.

2079
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:07,870
So I increase the chance of defeated dropping...

2080
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:08,010
Ooh!

2081
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:08,490
Okay.

2082
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:09,470
I want good luck charm.

2083
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,310
I'll take the good luck.

2084
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:13,630
How much do I need to...

2085
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:14,410
Okay.

2086
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:15,850
Customized vehicle...

2087
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:17,650
Uh...

2088
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:20,290
Upgrade part...

2089
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:23,030
I need premium steel still.

2090
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:24,130
God damn it.

2091
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:24,970
I don't have enough...

2092
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,590
I don't have enough, like...

2093
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:27,650
You can make a backup tank.

2094
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:28,550
I don't need backup.

2095
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:34,010
I don't need backup.

2096
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:35,450
I don't need backup.

2097
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:35,830
I don't need backup.

2098
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:38,130
Uh... Upgrade vehicle.

2099
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:40,310
There's still... Oh wait, I can upgrade this.

2100
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:40,950
Nice.

2101
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,850
Okay.

2102
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:43,810
We'll upgrade that then.

2103
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:48,010
Uh... Super hard Krakdor alloy.

2104
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,230
What the fuck?

2105
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:51,310
Do I have one of those?

2106
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:53,370
I don't know.

2107
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:55,950
Oh, I can get another chip slot!

2108
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:56,450
Yes!

2109
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:57,370
Finally.

2110
01:28:58,170 --> 01:28:58,710
Alright.

2111
01:28:58,930 --> 01:28:59,910
And then...

2112
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:01,910
Parts...

2113
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:04,810
Uh... Customized.

2114
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:07,010
Finally, I can have another chip slot.

2115
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,670
I'll just use the power chip...

2116
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:09,810
Oh!

2117
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:10,490
Machine gun.

2118
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:11,230
Quick reload.

2119
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:13,150
Incinerate chip.

2120
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:15,810
Uh... When using cannons.

2121
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:16,270
Ooh!

2122
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:16,890
I like that.

2123
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:18,130
I want them to be on fire.

2124
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,530
Uh... Acceleration.

2125
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:21,790
Increases vehicle.

2126
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,610
Reduces cannon reload time.

2127
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:26,170
Quick reload would be nice.

2128
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:27,350
Like, but I feel like...

2129
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:28,450
My laser...

2130
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:31,250
Does that affect the charges, though?

2131
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:32,790
I think that's fine.

2132
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,910
I think the incinerate is better.

2133
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:39,730
Uh... Would it actually be better?

2134
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,630
I don't know.

2135
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:42,470
I'm using the other...

2136
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:45,210
I use the other gun until my reload's done.

2137
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:48,310
Uh...

2138
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:50,390
I mean, I could try...

2139
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,250
Quick reload.

2140
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:55,210
I'll try quick reload.

2141
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:56,170
Okay.

2142
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:56,830
See you later!

2143
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:01,950
Yeah, I feel like the gun reloads pretty fast.

2144
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,270
That's why I'm gonna do incinerate.

2145
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:05,750
I'm gonna do incinerate.

2146
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:07,250
Just cause I feel like...

2147
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:11,030
I feel like I reload really fast already.

2148
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:13,070
So, like, I don't think I need it.

2149
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:14,990
I'd rather have the incinerate.

2150
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,390
See you later!

2151
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:19,550
Alright.

2152
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:20,690
We go.

2153
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,210
Go now.

2154
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:29,630
I just need to find more premium ore wherever that is.

2155
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:33,670
I need to find more ore in Forest Land.

2156
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:36,330
That's where they have all the good shit.

2157
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,210
Forest Land has all the good shit.

2158
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,100
Alright.

2159
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,000
Here we go.

2160
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,740
I'm heading to the capital.

2161
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,660
Why do you always ask me that?

2162
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,320
Just let me in.

2163
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,440
I'm literally outranking you.

2164
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:01,820
Alright.

2165
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,020
Time to eat more of my dinner.

2166
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,460
Lunch.

2167
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,280
Yeah!

2168
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:09,940
That's me!

2169
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,840
Munch, munch.

2170
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:26,520
Wait, what?

2171
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,240
Okay, nevermind.

2172
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:28,800
Guess not.

2173
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,620
I thought...

2174
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:33,280
I thought this was gonna be a longer cutscene.

2175
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,460
What the fuck?

2176
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:34,840
Okay.

2177
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,060
Alright, I'm ready.

2178
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:38,540
Nevermind.

2179
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:40,720
Off we go.

2180
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:43,820
Okay.

2181
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:46,700
Alright.

2182
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:49,880
I thought it'd be a longer cutscene, but that's okay.

2183
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,220
Here I go.

2184
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,900
It's this way.

2185
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,940
Where the fucking...

2186
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,600
Where do they call it?

2187
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,140
What are these guys called again?

2188
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:05,500
The robo-gangsters I'm doing here?

2189
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,940
Not caring about how there's a war right now with the Forest Landers?

2190
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,360
Alright.

2191
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,840
There's one of those bases.

2192
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,240
No time to eat, soldier.

2193
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:18,960
It's time for war!

2194
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,220
Alright.

2195
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,520
Is that it?

2196
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,860
I can barely see because there's a giant checkpoint in front of me.

2197
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:27,840
.

2198
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,200
Alright.

2199
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:33,520
Okay.

2200
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:34,780
Woo!

2201
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,080
Woo!

2202
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,120
Alright.

2203
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,420
Get away from me.

2204
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:42,640
Nice.

2205
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,740
Alright, we gotta make sure we shoot...

2206
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,340
Shoot the tank.

2207
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:49,900
It's a tank.

2208
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:50,980
Okay.

2209
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,560
We gotta reload and then shoot the humans.

2210
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:56,080
And then...

2211
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:56,600
See?

2212
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,780
We don't need the reload!

2213
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,540
The reload is already so strong!

2214
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:01,320
Oh my god.

2215
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,000
Did I get him?

2216
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:02,860
Okay, I did.

2217
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:03,600
I couldn't tell.

2218
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,400
It's so hard to tell sometimes.

2219
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:09,540
This giant checkpoint is actually so...

2220
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:09,940
What?

2221
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,620
The giant fucking area.

2222
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,140
I'll be like, this is where you have to go.

2223
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,000
Alright.

2224
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:18,280
Nice.

2225
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,720
We got one checkpoint back.

2226
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:21,820
Oh, you're still alive?

2227
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:22,760
Your friends are dead!

2228
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,000
Alright.

2229
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,060
Now everybody's dead.

2230
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,860
I think we took out all the enemies here.

2231
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,160
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2232
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,680
Alright, let's head to the next base.

2233
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,180
I'm gonna rob your wallet too.

2234
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,300
Next base is over here.

2235
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,400
How do we get here?

2236
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,360
I need to figure out how to get here.

2237
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:45,820
How the fuck do I get there?

2238
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,720
Does that need water?

2239
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,540
That's in the water, right?

2240
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,700
I feel like that's in the water.

2241
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,400
It's like a bridge here.

2242
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:03,360
What the fuck do I...

2243
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:03,620
What?

2244
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,340
I hope it's in the water.

2245
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:12,960
Alright, let's see.

2246
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:18,140
The worst part is that this car is so slow.

2247
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,520
And I can't...

2248
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,580
You can't go faster.

2249
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,700
It's such a slow car.

2250
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,680
Oh my god.

2251
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:26,860
Oh my god.

2252
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:30,920
Bye bye.

2253
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,960
Which campsite?

2254
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,940
There's a campsite here?

2255
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:39,360
Really?

2256
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,680
It's open to all travelers?

2257
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,000
It feels like it's being...

2258
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,560
It's open to the rebels right now.

2259
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,620
Or the Sandlanders.

2260
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,320
No, it's Forest...

2261
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:47,600
Sorry.

2262
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:48,900
They're all blurring together.

2263
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,740
I've been like on so many different sides.

2264
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:53,920
I've been...

2265
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,160
Fusible didn't kill anyone.

2266
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:56,640
Did they...

2267
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:56,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

2268
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:57,220
Oh, you're right.

2269
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,840
You're so...

2270
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,120
You're so true, man.

2271
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,640
So true, Persona.

2272
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,000
Thank you for the super chat.

2273
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,520
Thank you.

2274
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:03,060
Thank you.

2275
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:07,000
It's not my fault my tank hit somebody.

2276
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:10,900
What do you call that in the legal system?

2277
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,940
You know, like hit it...

2278
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:16,500
It's not like hit it runs or a thing and that...

2279
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,180
Alright, how do I get up there?

2280
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:22,660
You just start by observing them carefully.

2281
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,440
Knowing what they can do...

2282
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,180
And just get off this?

2283
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,900
And what their weaknesses are will help you fight effectively.

2284
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,400
Serve them, huh?

2285
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:31,600
Not a good spot.

2286
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:32,380
Try that next time.

2287
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:35,260
What the fuck?

2288
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,340
How do I get up there?

2289
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,820
Yeah, it's not like manslaughter is a real fucking crime or anything.

2290
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,460
Alright, do I get up from here?

2291
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,640
Oh, it's from here.

2292
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:50,360
Okay.

2293
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:51,160
Nice.

2294
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,160
We figured it out.

2295
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,340
Your audience knife killed him, not me.

2296
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:01,860
Wait, we figured it out, guys.

2297
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:06,760
Are these the bad guys?

2298
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:07,440
Oh, shit!

2299
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,780
Hey there!

2300
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,040
Hey, guys!

2301
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,900
Guys, I found the bad guys!

2302
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,340
I found the bad guys!

2303
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,700
It's okay, I did it!

2304
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,340
I found him!

2305
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,940
They were...

2306
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:26,560
Guys, who would've thought they were the bad guys?

2307
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:27,800
Oh my god!

2308
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,060
I cannot see!

2309
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,280
I can't see!

2310
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,120
Okay.

2311
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,600
Jesus Christ.

2312
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,500
That was like so many different things on my screen.

2313
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:45,420
Alright, nice.

2314
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,600
Give me your shit.

2315
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:48,160
Give me your fucking money.

2316
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:50,600
What's over here?

2317
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,960
What were they hiding from?

2318
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,180
Down here.

2319
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,660
They're hiding anything?

2320
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,620
Oh, it's like a little checkpoint!

2321
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,420
Oh, it's a secret tunnel!

2322
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:06,290
Who's that?

2323
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,040
Goodbye.

2324
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,140
This map was just...

2325
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,600
And he's gone now.

2326
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,800
I got a little secret!

2327
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:30,160
This guy was just checking his phone and was like, oh my god, I'm gonna die!

2328
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:30,440
Oh...

2329
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:31,840
I have a new message!

2330
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:32,720
Yeah!

2331
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,940
Getting lost and having a backdrop would be a pain.

2332
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:37,420
Let's see...

2333
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:38,340
Gotta go here.

2334
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,260
There's apparently more people over there.

2335
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,200
Does my tank fit through?

2336
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:43,740
It does!

2337
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,100
Oh my god, guys, I can't believe I just got promoted.

2338
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:48,520
Pew!

2339
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,020
Oh...

2340
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:50,960
Did you guys hear that?

2341
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:53,160
Just like...

2342
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,460
Did you hear that over there?

2343
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:54,760
I do!

2344
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:59,380
I wonder what can that be?

2345
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,140
Oh wow!

2346
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,640
Oh god, he's upstairs?

2347
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,880
Oh, I cannot aim there.

2348
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,220
Alright.

2349
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:10,560
The longest run of your life.

2350
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:13,680
Nice, alright.

2351
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,480
Must have been the wind.

2352
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:20,280
Alright, next base.

2353
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:21,420
Where's the next base?

2354
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:25,420
Where is it?

2355
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,460
Oh, it's over here.

2356
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:28,800
How the fuck do I get there?

2357
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,780
How do I get there?

2358
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,800
How the fuck do I get here?

2359
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,820
Okay, this I assume is here.

2360
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,240
Uhhh... I need to figure...

2361
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,760
How the fuck... How the fuck do I get there?

2362
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,120
Is it from here?

2363
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,620
Oh, it's on the other side of the water!

2364
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:57,500
Oh, whoops.

2365
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,360
Oh, whoops!

2366
01:38:58,720 --> 01:38:59,960
Uhhh... wrong side!

2367
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,600
Wrong... wait, no, right side!

2368
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,960
Wait, no, I can just get through from the water here.

2369
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:05,900
Okay.

2370
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,120
I just need to hover.

2371
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,100
Hover time!

2372
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,560
There's another area right there that I can hover.

2373
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,420
Whoopsie-sand!

2374
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,760
I can't tell!

2375
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,580
The map is so difficult!

2376
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:26,260
It's not a me issue, it's the map!

2377
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:26,860
The map issue!

2378
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,800
The map is so difficult to read!

2379
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:32,620
Alright.

2380
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,040
Up we go.

2381
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:42,840
Guys, that bridge, there was a gap in there.

2382
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,580
You don't understand.

2383
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,200
You didn't see it, but my gamer eyes, I could tell.

2384
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:52,560
There was like a huge gap in between, so there was no way to get across that bridge.

2385
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,680
I know you guys can't see it.

2386
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,600
Because you don't have the gamer eyes like me.

2387
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:57,660
But there was...

2388
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,500
Alright, let's see.

2389
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:03,980
There they are.

2390
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:13,020
Oh, wait, that was not big boss.

2391
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:14,900
That was just some random...

2392
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,620
That was just a random...

2393
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,160
Random soldier's bot right there.

2394
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,600
Alright, that guy's dead.

2395
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,820
That was like, there's no way that guy died so fast.

2396
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,460
It's a communal camp that's open to all travelers.

2397
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,640
Yeah, including me.

2398
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:32,080
Talk about convenient!

2399
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,640
Alright, where's the...

2400
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,220
Where's the main guy?

2401
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:39,380
Where's the main guy?

2402
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:40,500
Is that the main guy?

2403
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:42,580
Oh, that is.

2404
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:43,080
Okay.

2405
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:43,940
Wait, no.

2406
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,180
Oh, that's the main guy!

2407
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:45,820
Okay.

2408
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,120
Phew!

2409
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:50,620
Phew!

2410
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:50,700
Phew!

2411
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,740
Yeah, you think you're stronger than me?

2412
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:55,420
I really...

2413
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:55,880
You know what?

2414
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,820
I'm gonna overkill.

2415
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,140
I'm gonna do it.

2416
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:00,920
Can I do it?

2417
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,980
Oh, shit!

2418
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:14,450
What is up?

2419
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,240
See?

2420
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,980
I told you guys there was no bridge!

2421
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,460
I told you!

2422
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:34,800
What do you mean there was... I told you, you guys were like, wow Toki, you're fucking coping Toki.

2423
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,160
There's a bridge right here.

2424
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,680
I told you there was a hole!

2425
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,780
Nobody believed my hole!

2426
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,100
Nobody believed in me when I said there was a hole.

2427
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,260
You guys were like, Toki, you're fucking coping.

2428
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:06,460
You just crossed the bridge.

2429
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,400
What bridge?

2430
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,940
I blew that bridge up!

2431
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:16,380
The bridge they spawned.

2432
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:19,920
They were like, wow Toki, you crossed the bridge.

2433
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,600
It was literally right next to you.

2434
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:35,280
To be fair, I actually made that shit up about there not being a bridge because even I was like, wait, was there actually a bridge?

2435
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,740
And then I was right.

2436
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:38,360
I was just a psychic.

2437
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:39,580
I knew...

2438
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,520
I forewarned the bridge.

2439
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,220
The missing bridge.

2440
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,520
Alright, let's see.

2441
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:50,620
I was just psychic.

2442
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:51,860
I could read the future.

2443
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:55,280
Let's see.

2444
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,840
How do I use this laser?

2445
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,160
Like, how do I use this?

2446
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:04,260
I'm gonna use it for this one guy.

2447
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:07,920
Oh!

2448
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,840
That's how you... Oh my god, I'm so stupid.

2449
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:18,200
That's how you use it.

2450
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,100
Guys, I figured it out.

2451
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:23,680
I figured out how to use the laser.

2452
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:25,120
That's so cool!

2453
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,040
Why couldn't I use that before?

2454
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:33,790
Alright, let's get rid of...

2455
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:36,610
Let's get rid of the little guys first.

2456
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:39,570
Because these guys are very annoying.

2457
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:41,350
Alright, where's the big guy?

2458
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:43,270
Big guy, where are you?

2459
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:46,590
There you are, big boy.

2460
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:48,110
Oh, I missed.

2461
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:50,010
But like, there you are for real.

2462
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:51,250
Oh, I should heal.

2463
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:52,190
Give me a sec.

2464
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:53,990
I should really heal.

2465
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:58,710
So we don't go through that issue again.

2466
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,050
What the fuck are you doing?

2467
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:03,190
Creating a desert?

2468
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:07,730
A desert?

2469
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:10,110
Okay, how did I miss again?

2470
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:13,310
Okay.

2471
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:14,210
Alright.

2472
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:18,590
Oh, I was reloading.

2473
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:19,790
I didn't even know I was reloading.

2474
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:25,430
But I can't see so many things at once!

2475
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:26,850
Okay.

2476
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:28,550
Nice.

2477
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:30,130
Easy!

2478
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,470
So easy.

2479
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:35,010
I think we took out all the enemies here.

2480
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:36,030
I think so too, right?

2481
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:38,110
Alright, let's head to the next base.

2482
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:39,910
How do we go to the next base?

2483
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:41,710
Can we go through here?

2484
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:44,210
I can!

2485
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:47,130
Oh my god!

2486
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:48,790
The Kingly base!

2487
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:50,790
Wait, I'm already here!

2488
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:54,550
Where are they?

2489
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:57,870
Wait, where are they?

2490
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:00,930
Where's the bad guys?

2491
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,170
Oh, there they are.

2492
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:03,870
Oh, there's the bad guys.

2493
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:04,590
Don't worry.

2494
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:08,760
Sorry.

2495
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:09,180
Whoops.

2496
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:10,480
Oh, it's okay.

2497
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,340
He can't go upstairs.

2498
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:14,880
And I can't shoot down too.

2499
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:19,760
Equivalent exchange.

2500
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,340
Can I just roll down here?

2501
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:23,720
My tank will be okay.

2502
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:24,360
Yeah, my tank.

2503
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:25,540
See, my tank's okay!

2504
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Wait, he blocked?

2505
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:30,060
Wait, he can block!

2506
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:32,680
That's illegal!

2507
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:34,520
Fight me!

2508
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:36,580
Come on!

2509
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,240
What the fuck is he doing?

2510
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,120
Wait, he's literally just blocking.

2511
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,160
What is he doing?

2512
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,800
Okay, now you fucking fight back!

2513
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:52,720
Okay!

2514
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,740
Oh, use the laser?

2515
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:57,200
You're right.

2516
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:57,860
I'm gonna do it.

2517
01:45:58,020 --> 01:45:59,060
I know how to use it now.

2518
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:02,480
There we go.

2519
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,020
Oh my god, that was instant.

2520
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,980
That was actually just instant.

2521
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,360
Alright, let's reload.

2522
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,060
And then...

2523
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:15,840
Alright, we gotta reload this one too.

2524
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:17,940
Wait, is there another officer?

2525
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:21,400
No, he just doesn't have HP because he's not important enough.

2526
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,800
Just not important enough, man.

2527
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:25,060
What can I say?

2528
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:27,900
The fuck?

2529
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,120
Why are you still alive?

2530
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:33,140
Yeah, that's actually really good against bosses.

2531
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:34,100
I think.

2532
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:38,800
Head back to the command center.

2533
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:39,720
I did it!

2534
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,900
I saved the world!

2535
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:44,680
The world being only Sandland.

2536
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,040
But that's all that matters.

2537
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,600
We really let loose!

2538
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,560
With this, we should be able to delay their invasion.

2539
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:59,540
Well, as long as that giant tank unit doesn't remobilize, that is.

2540
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:03,120
Rosetta didn't show up at any of these battles.

2541
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,120
Did she go back to Forestland?

2542
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:06,780
Am I going back to Forestland?

2543
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:07,760
Maybe.

2544
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,020
I just got used to it.

2545
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:09,960
The tank is unique as hers.

2546
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,820
Probably can't be repaired out in the field.

2547
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:16,540
Thankfully, that'll buy us some time.

2548
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:19,680
Heh, nice one, Prince!

2549
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:22,560
Wait,

2550
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:27,160
that's not mine.

2551
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,400
Wait, who is it?

2552
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:29,860
Who's calling me?

2553
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:30,660
Oh, new phone.

2554
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:31,120
Who's this?

2555
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:31,480
It's mine.

2556
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:35,960
Finally got through, Princess.

2557
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,400
Glad you're safe.

2558
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:45,090
Wish you'd called me Sir Croa.

2559
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:45,730
Good, anyway.

2560
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:48,470
It's Doctor Croa.

2561
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:51,150
It's like those people who are like, um, it's Doctor.

2562
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:56,430
Wouldn't it be better to tell me now?

2563
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,570
Never know who might be listening.

2564
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:01,510
Can't say this on air.

2565
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:02,870
Just hurry.

2566
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:05,430
Believe me, he'll blow you away.

2567
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:07,370
It's gonna blow me away.

2568
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:07,930
Come on.

2569
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:11,330
He wouldn't ask for help.

2570
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:12,470
He'd be like, I'm gonna take this of us without cause.

2571
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:13,350
Let's go.

2572
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:16,690
I'll inform General Aray by radio.

2573
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:23,550
Alright, I didn't get knighted just to be not called Sir.

2574
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,570
Alright, let's see.

2575
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:29,690
Where is he?

2576
01:48:30,130 --> 01:48:31,270
Where does he live?

2577
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:33,630
Where the fuck?

2578
01:48:33,650 --> 01:48:33,990
What?

2579
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:35,050
Where the fuck?

2580
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:35,730
Is he in forest?

2581
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:37,410
Oh, we have to go to forest land.

2582
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:39,570
Alright, where is he?

2583
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:42,450
Back point's in forest land?

2584
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:44,030
At the walk?

2585
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:45,630
Oh, wait.

2586
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:46,950
No, I hit it.

2587
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:47,510
Oh, no.

2588
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:49,010
I have the treasure map on.

2589
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:49,670
Okay, never mind.

2590
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:50,630
I was gonna be like, no.

2591
01:48:51,010 --> 01:48:52,190
Don't make me walk.

2592
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:59,190
We're back in the forest land with all these forest landers.

2593
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:02,370
Okay, we need, uh...

2594
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:07,990
We need to buy...

2595
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,370
Oh, hey.

2596
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:09,670
Got stuff?

2597
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:11,490
We have premium steel.

2598
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:12,330
We have premium steel!

2599
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:18,270
And the AN drive for your mech is particularly fun.

2600
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:19,550
Okay, that's right.

2601
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:20,910
Oh, here's the AN drive.

2602
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:22,390
Alright.

2603
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:23,390
We need that.

2604
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:25,170
Well, we don't really need any of these.

2605
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:28,510
Alright.

2606
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:30,890
Who constructs my stuff?

2607
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:31,930
You guys.

2608
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,170
Workshop man!

2609
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:36,210
You have premium steel.

2610
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:37,290
Oh, I need platinum ore.

2611
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:39,390
Fucking, I keep forgetting about the platinum ore shit.

2612
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:39,790
Oh!

2613
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:40,870
Oh, wait.

2614
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:41,730
We don't need that, actually.

2615
01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:42,170
Never mind.

2616
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:43,610
Uh...

2617
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:46,170
Are you not the upgrade guy?

2618
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:48,930
Do I have enough to upgrade?

2619
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:50,110
Parts.

2620
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:51,290
Upgrade part.

2621
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:52,990
I do!

2622
01:49:53,610 --> 01:49:55,610
I finally have enough platinum steel!

2623
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:57,730
Max level.

2624
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:58,290
Nice.

2625
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:00,230
Uh...

2626
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:01,870
Apparently...

2627
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,270
It doesn't matter.

2628
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:04,830
Okay, customize vehicle.

2629
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:06,970
Uh...

2630
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:09,870
Oh my god.

2631
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:10,710
Oh, this...

2632
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:11,670
Okay.

2633
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:12,890
Uh...

2634
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:13,710
What?

2635
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:14,690
Legendary?

2636
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:15,730
What level is it?

2637
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:17,030
25?!

2638
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:20,350
What the fuck?

2639
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:24,170
I need to be level 25?

2640
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:27,030
Holy shit.

2641
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:28,290
Okay.

2642
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:31,690
How much do I need for that?

2643
01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:34,150
I'm like...

2644
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:35,610
I'm like five levels short.

2645
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:39,230
Okay, upgrade vehicle.

2646
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,370
Okay.

2647
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:44,290
I need super hard croctor alloy.

2648
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:47,850
I need a lot of super hard croctor alloy.

2649
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:49,910
Where do I get that, though?

2650
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:53,150
I don't even have it.

2651
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:56,790
You can't even...

2652
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:57,810
What even is it?

2653
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:00,550
What the fuck is the...

2654
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:03,590
What the fuck is a super hard croctor alloy?

2655
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:06,110
And how do I get it?

2656
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:09,370
Oh, level 20 plus is possible.

2657
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:09,770
Post game?

2658
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:11,770
So I just have to look at it?

2659
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:15,430
I can just...

2660
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:19,550
I have to look at the legendary parts and I can't do anything about...

2661
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:20,230
That's so cruel.

2662
01:51:20,490 --> 01:51:22,110
That is so fucked up.

2663
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:24,390
All I can do is look at it.

2664
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:25,170
Oh, yeah.

2665
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:25,330
No.

2666
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:27,150
I need the battle armor.

2667
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:29,170
What is the...

2668
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:29,310
Oh.

2669
01:51:29,330 --> 01:51:30,070
Is this the andrive?

2670
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:30,950
Alright.

2671
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:31,710
Whoa.

2672
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:34,750
Temporarily boost performance.

2673
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:36,770
Enables long range cannon.

2674
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:38,610
What does cannon...

2675
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:39,350
Enable...

2676
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:41,850
And this is a long range cannon.

2677
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:47,050
I can just look at it and be like, I have this now.

2678
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:50,510
I can't do anything about it, but I have it.

2679
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:55,690
Up we go.

2680
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:57,370
It's called eye shopping.

2681
01:52:00,910 --> 01:52:01,950
This way.

2682
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:03,670
Hello guys.

2683
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:08,530
Before we do anything and use the bathroom, I'll be right back.

2684
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,940
Alright, I'm back.

2685
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,200
I'm back guys.

2686
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,020
Thank you for the super chats.

2687
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:46,960
Valentine, Duck, Byte, Johnny, LostCore, Kaz, and...

2688
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,180
Oh my gosh, I need to scroll up.

2689
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:48,880
And Ellen!

2690
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:49,900
Thank you for the super chat.

2691
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:50,180
Thank you.

2692
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,740
Alright, we're ready to talk General Kroa.

2693
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,140
You're on my side now.

2694
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:57,800
Yeah, it's me.

2695
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:07,230
Oh my god, you're dead.

2696
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:08,190
We're gonna find you dead.

2697
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:13,310
Whoa.

2698
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:14,950
Damn, we gotta learn from him.

2699
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:21,130
Alright, maybe I was stretching the truth just a little bit.

2700
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:24,310
But cross my heart, the stuff about King Jam is legit.

2701
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:27,250
Where is my father?

2702
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:31,050
Crump Army Research Lab.

2703
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:33,970
And this information's reliable?

2704
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:36,930
Very much so.

2705
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:42,510
Kroa's subordinates helped us feed false information to the Forestland Army.

2706
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:47,410
About the Resistance having a plan to rescue the King.

2707
01:54:47,710 --> 01:54:48,270
Okay.

2708
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:53,250
With the slight exaggeration that they knew exactly where he was being locked up.

2709
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:55,670
It spread like wildfire.

2710
01:54:56,350 --> 01:55:01,450
At which point, Bread quietly switched out the research lab guards for a team of his handpicked elites.

2711
01:55:01,810 --> 01:55:03,690
Oh, so that's how you found out.

2712
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:04,070
I know.

2713
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:07,190
So he's not guarded by nerds anymore.

2714
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:14,690
Well, not like we have any choice.

2715
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:17,930
How will you save him?

2716
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:23,170
By going forward with a fake rescue mission.

2717
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:24,310
Oh my god.

2718
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:25,230
Wait, what?

2719
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:29,010
With the rest of our army, the five people again.

2720
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:33,310
Oh my god, another, all out assault.

2721
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:36,150
Me and my five people.

2722
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:40,010
My father's being held in the crump army.

2723
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:41,990
Another all out assault with five.

2724
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:44,470
And that's where we'll be going, right?

2725
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:49,850
Misdirection's the greatest weapon an outnumbered force has.

2726
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:52,450
Diversion and infiltration, baby.

2727
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,370
Same as always then.

2728
01:55:56,510 --> 01:55:59,290
Including us being stuck with the risky part.

2729
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:01,570
I mean...

2730
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:04,050
I want the three random guys they found on the street.

2731
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:04,890
...will never be the best.

2732
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:08,810
I mean, they're not even close to us.

2733
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:10,250
We gotta speak.

2734
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:10,750
Alright.

2735
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:11,970
We did it.

2736
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:13,050
We finished our mission.

2737
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:13,830
That was fast.

2738
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:18,250
Now we need to go to the army research lab.

2739
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:18,890
Where is...

2740
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:19,630
Oh, it's not that far.

2741
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:21,930
Wait, never claimed this?

2742
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:23,650
Well, I guess I gotta go here.

2743
01:56:23,870 --> 01:56:25,030
Uh, which is fast.

2744
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:27,370
Okay, I assume this is the cliff.

2745
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:29,730
Guys, I can read maps now.

2746
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:31,470
I can do it.

2747
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:32,450
I did it.

2748
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:33,610
Okay.

2749
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:34,610
Here we go.

2750
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:35,810
And then...

2751
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:37,150
It is this way?

2752
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:42,730
Okay, there should be like a mountain to climb here.

2753
01:56:43,630 --> 01:56:44,110
Here?

2754
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:45,570
What's this?

2755
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:48,450
Oh my god, are those premium ores?

2756
01:56:48,910 --> 01:56:49,390
Wait!

2757
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:51,850
That might be a premium ore right there!

2758
01:56:53,890 --> 01:56:56,430
Oh my god, we are running dry on the premium ore.

2759
01:56:58,030 --> 01:57:01,530
Careful, jam might be spread all over bread by the time you find it.

2760
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:03,370
I'm thinking of the super chat deadpool.

2761
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:03,730
Thank you.

2762
01:57:03,730 --> 01:57:05,590
I can read maps!

2763
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:07,250
This is a premium ore?

2764
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:11,030
Oh my god, it's just regular iron ore.

2765
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:12,170
God dammit.

2766
01:57:12,910 --> 01:57:18,290
God fucking dam- what am I gonna do with goddamn- what am I gonna do with nighter ore?

2767
01:57:22,610 --> 01:57:23,670
Alright, here we go.

2768
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:24,550
It's fine.

2769
01:57:28,130 --> 01:57:30,650
I think I'm going the right way, right?

2770
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:31,350
Yeah, I am.

2771
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:32,430
Thank god.

2772
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:32,530
Oh my god.

2773
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:36,110
It would be a little awkward if I wasn't reading the map right again.

2774
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:38,130
Wait, so where is the camp?

2775
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:40,110
Ow.

2776
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:42,710
Should be a campsite here?

2777
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:45,330
Where is it?

2778
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:48,690
I have to unlock a campsite so I have like fast travel.

2779
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:50,910
Where the fuck is the camp?

2780
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:51,530
Oh there it is.

2781
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:52,210
It's in front of me.

2782
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:55,090
Nice.

2783
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:57,490
Unlocked it.

2784
01:57:57,550 --> 01:57:57,710
Nice.

2785
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:57,970
Okay.

2786
01:57:58,010 --> 01:57:58,650
That's all I needed.

2787
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:03,360
Dungeon!

2788
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:04,280
Dungeon!

2789
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:22,700
Alright.

2790
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,460
Here we go.

2791
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,360
They should put those like tire spikes here.

2792
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,160
That would like stop me instantly.

2793
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:45,180
I'm surprised they don't put the tire spikes.

2794
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,040
Oh no.

2795
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:52,240
It's stealth time.

2796
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,000
Oh no.

2797
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,480
How the fuck?

2798
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:56,900
How do I get here?

2799
01:58:59,300 --> 01:58:59,840
Oh shit.

2800
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,380
I didn't resurrect!

2801
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:04,240
There are people here!

2802
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:06,880
I was just walking around being like, yay!

2803
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:10,160
Okay.

2804
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:12,680
I actually did not realize there were people here.

2805
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:13,800
So that was awkward.

2806
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:14,340
Okay.

2807
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:15,220
Oh!

2808
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:18,100
God damn it!

2809
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:19,920
It's not fair!

2810
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:21,940
How do I sneak again?

2811
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:24,300
Alright.

2812
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:27,740
Guys I don't remember how to sneak here.

2813
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,080
Alright.

2814
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:31,140
Well, we ghost!

2815
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:32,140
Nice.

2816
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,860
I carried out 10 stealth attacks guys.

2817
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:37,100
Alright.

2818
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:38,400
Oh my god.

2819
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:39,400
I sneak packed this guy.

2820
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,900
You can't catch me if I'm on high ground!

2821
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:45,320
You can't catch me if I'm on high ground!

2822
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:45,340
Ah!

2823
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:46,800
Ah!

2824
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:48,600
Ah!

2825
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:52,080
Okay.

2826
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,140
We'll go high ground.

2827
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:55,360
We'll go high ground.

2828
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:56,500
I'm gonna go high ground.

2829
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:57,680
Alright.

2830
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,380
There's only one guy in high ground.

2831
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:03,780
Yeah.

2832
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,000
The guards die of cringe.

2833
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:06,200
God damn it.

2834
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:07,400
I hate this stealth mission.

2835
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:09,920
Because it makes you restart from the beginning.

2836
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,200
Give me mini checkpoints of anything.

2837
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:14,040
Please.

2838
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,780
I'm stupid.

2839
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:19,040
Where's my journalist mode when it comes to stealth missions?

2840
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,460
This is why I'm not a thief anymore.

2841
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:21,840
Exactly.

2842
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:22,280
Exactly.

2843
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:29,600
I wish you could select difficulties on certain modes.

2844
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:30,620
If I had...

2845
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:34,860
I would fucking suck it in and take journalist mode for stealth missions.

2846
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:38,080
10?

2847
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,640
That's so many for you.

2848
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:41,380
How did you even get 10?

2849
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,100
That's crazy.

2850
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,300
I would take baby...

2851
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,860
I will 100% take baby mode for stealth missions.

2852
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:51,980
I am not afraid to be who I am.

2853
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:52,240
I am not afraid to be who I am.

2854
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,760
I am not afraid to be who I am.

2855
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:55,120
Oh.

2856
02:00:57,460 --> 02:00:58,780
Two hours later.

2857
02:00:59,320 --> 02:00:59,540
Two hours later.

2858
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:02,760
Oh.

2859
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:03,720
Come on.

2860
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:04,600
Come on.

2861
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:07,520
Why are you walking so far?

2862
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:09,260
Oh.

2863
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,200
There you are.

2864
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:14,020
Give me the mini checkpoint.

2865
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:14,440
Give me the mini checkpoint.

2866
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:15,500
I want it now.

2867
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,660
I want it now.

2868
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:21,160
I am definitely supposed to take high ground there.

2869
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:25,340
Okay.

2870
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:26,100
There he is.

2871
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,740
Standing there.

2872
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:29,760
There he is.

2873
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:33,120
Wait.

2874
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,380
There's multiple people there.

2875
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,060
How do I scare multiple people?

2876
02:01:40,030 --> 02:01:41,410
Do I have to go down?

2877
02:01:44,530 --> 02:01:47,550
How the fuck do I scare multiple people?

2878
02:01:51,510 --> 02:01:53,290
Is he seeing me over here?

2879
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:53,950
If I...

2880
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:55,830
What?

2881
02:01:56,230 --> 02:01:56,710
No!

2882
02:01:57,670 --> 02:01:58,990
That was so fast!

2883
02:01:59,190 --> 02:02:00,930
I was trying to judge the...

2884
02:02:00,930 --> 02:02:01,190
Okay.

2885
02:02:01,370 --> 02:02:01,790
That's great.

2886
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:03,510
Okay.

2887
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:05,210
I guess I have to go downstairs now.

2888
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:09,570
Oh my god.

2889
02:02:09,610 --> 02:02:10,490
That's so not fair.

2890
02:02:11,150 --> 02:02:12,650
There were two people there.

2891
02:02:15,730 --> 02:02:16,210
Okay.

2892
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:17,090
I'm going to scare him.

2893
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:20,110
Can I do this?

2894
02:02:20,370 --> 02:02:21,130
Is there something here?

2895
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:25,830
Can I just go behind them here?

2896
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:28,110
What the fuck?

2897
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:29,010
What is this place?

2898
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:31,890
What is this place?

2899
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:32,470
What do I...

2900
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:34,310
What do I do here?

2901
02:02:38,070 --> 02:02:39,690
There's something special here?

2902
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:43,030
Oh wait.

2903
02:02:43,110 --> 02:02:43,330
What?

2904
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:44,930
Am I supposed to be here?

2905
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:46,890
Like...

2906
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:47,730
Where am I?

2907
02:02:50,710 --> 02:02:52,690
Am I supposed to be here?

2908
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:53,310
Am I supposed to be here?

2909
02:02:53,310 --> 02:02:53,930
Like... Okay.

2910
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:59,150
There's a shell plane here.

2911
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:02,330
I don't know if I'm supposed to go that way.

2912
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:03,650
I don't know if I'm supposed to go that way.

2913
02:03:03,730 --> 02:03:04,710
Or this way.

2914
02:03:05,230 --> 02:03:06,030
I'm so confused.

2915
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:07,150
I'm risking it.

2916
02:03:07,950 --> 02:03:08,350
Alright.

2917
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:11,790
Oh.

2918
02:03:15,090 --> 02:03:15,750
Where am I?

2919
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:17,030
Where am I?

2920
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:18,410
Where did I go?

2921
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:23,150
I don't know.

2922
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:25,390
I don't know where I went.

2923
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:33,260
I'm following the yellow area.

2924
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,460
I'm going off route.

2925
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,040
God damn it!

2926
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:44,760
That's so unfair.

2927
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:46,780
I don't see that next to me.

2928
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:48,060
That's so unfair.

2929
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:48,060
I don't see that next to me.

2930
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:48,940
I saw me.

2931
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:50,840
Gotta be more careful.

2932
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:54,860
Okay.

2933
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:55,860
Oh it is!

2934
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:56,180
It is!

2935
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,860
This is the way we're meant to do.

2936
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:02,570
We're off the grid!

2937
02:04:02,970 --> 02:04:04,150
We're going off grid!

2938
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:05,950
As I follow the yellow marker!

2939
02:04:06,650 --> 02:04:09,790
As I follow the yellow marker!

2940
02:04:13,630 --> 02:04:15,650
Where did the yellow marker go?

2941
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:17,230
No!

2942
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,770
Where do I go when there's no...

2943
02:04:18,770 --> 02:04:19,510
Oh there it is!

2944
02:04:20,970 --> 02:04:21,610
Okay.

2945
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:22,590
This way.

2946
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:26,350
What the fuck!

2947
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:28,490
God damn it!

2948
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:30,270
That's bullshit!

2949
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,310
Okay thank god.

2950
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:33,150
I saw me.

2951
02:04:33,510 --> 02:04:35,010
Gotta be more careful.

2952
02:04:36,890 --> 02:04:37,530
Alright.

2953
02:04:38,830 --> 02:04:39,470
Whew!

2954
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:42,570
God damn camper!

2955
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:45,090
Alright we did it.

2956
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:46,670
That was the route we were supposed to go.

2957
02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:48,270
Oh.

2958
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:49,090
Downstairs?

2959
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,450
This room is downstairs.

2960
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:55,150
Alright down the stairs we go.

2961
02:04:58,070 --> 02:04:58,570
Oh.

2962
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:00,510
Oh there they are!

2963
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:01,390
Wait they made it?

2964
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:03,210
How did you guys get there before me?

2965
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:07,970
Why did you guys tell me how to...

2966
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:09,650
What pathway did you guys go?

2967
02:05:18,770 --> 02:05:19,470
I'm not getting out.

2968
02:05:19,790 --> 02:05:20,950
You mean...

2969
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:22,310
Oh Jem!

2970
02:05:23,150 --> 02:05:23,850
Can you open this?

2971
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:26,590
I could do this in my sleep.

2972
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:30,130
This is...

2973
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:31,410
Just a little wiggle here...

2974
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:32,770
Where your dad is?

2975
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:39,740
Dad!

2976
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:44,920
He better be like super hot if he managed to catch the demon as a wife.

2977
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:46,140
What?

2978
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:48,300
Or like really smart.

2979
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,000
Or like really nice person.

2980
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,000
What the fuck?

2981
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:53,380
Fuck?

2982
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:59,250
Do you know...

2983
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:00,730
His sister settled for him?

2984
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:03,050
Of course I do, Anne.

2985
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:07,670
There's no way I'd fail to recognize my one and only daughter.

2986
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:08,710
Just...

2987
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:09,630
It's Peter Griffin.

2988
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:12,010
Just a dad.

2989
02:06:14,690 --> 02:06:16,630
Bro that doesn't even look like a king.

2990
02:06:17,130 --> 02:06:18,050
He looks like some...

2991
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:20,690
Some fucking office man worker.

2992
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:24,150
That's the most...

2993
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:24,370
That's the most...

2994
02:06:24,370 --> 02:06:25,990
Sad dad I've ever seen.

2995
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:29,710
I'm sorry.

2996
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:31,250
This has to be an emotional moment.

2997
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:34,390
Were you the ones who...

2998
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:36,030
Bro he looks like a fucking...

2999
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:38,790
Like he's off to work at the office.

3000
02:06:38,830 --> 02:06:41,050
He looks like a fucking salary man.

3001
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:42,110
Not a king.

3002
02:06:43,150 --> 02:06:45,130
He just clocked out.

3003
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:48,190
He looks like a god damn salary worker.

3004
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:51,710
All we really did was bring her here.

3005
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:53,250
The dadliest dad.

3006
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:53,850
I'm sorry.

3007
02:06:54,150 --> 02:06:54,350
I'm sorry.

3008
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:57,610
The most stupid I've ever seen.

3009
02:06:57,630 --> 02:06:58,970
Just clocked out.

3010
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:01,870
Long ago?

3011
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:04,530
And...

3012
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:06,490
He looked after this too.

3013
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:09,130
Oh...

3014
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:10,530
Lilith's necklace.

3015
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:12,830
Yes but...

3016
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:14,270
Mother is...

3017
02:07:14,270 --> 02:07:15,650
Is she dead?

3018
02:07:15,850 --> 02:07:18,170
I heard what happened to her while I was in prison.

3019
02:07:19,030 --> 02:07:19,730
Lilith...

3020
02:07:19,730 --> 02:07:22,030
I still can't believe it.

3021
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:23,290
He just left his 9 to 5.

3022
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:24,330
He just left his 9 to 5.

3023
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:26,370
But considering you have to...

3024
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:26,510
He's a king!

3025
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:28,730
Why you don't be a king?

3026
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:30,090
Is like business casual?

3027
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:35,470
Business casual king?

3028
02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:40,210
At least Bradley was in uniform.

3029
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:44,370
You do?

3030
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:46,030
And it's real?

3031
02:07:48,570 --> 02:07:49,170
Yeah.

3032
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:52,110
We've been gathering it all up.

3033
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:54,230
To keep bread from getting his hands on.

3034
02:07:55,070 --> 02:07:56,730
Clocked out of prison time.

3035
02:07:57,290 --> 02:07:58,910
This certainly is a quanium.

3036
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:00,590
Yeah.

3037
02:08:00,810 --> 02:08:01,470
See?

3038
02:08:02,910 --> 02:08:03,650
Whoa!

3039
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:04,870
What happened?

3040
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:05,570
Huh?

3041
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:07,230
What's going on?

3042
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:09,690
Hey!

3043
02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:10,310
Where are you going?

3044
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:10,910
Business king.

3045
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,330
He's business king.

3046
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:15,310
I don't know.

3047
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:17,710
My body is just moving by itself.

3048
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:18,350
What's going on?

3049
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:21,250
No.

3050
02:08:21,410 --> 02:08:22,970
Please stop her.

3051
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:23,750
Not gonna lie.

3052
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:24,550
Nobody...

3053
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:24,930
No.

3054
02:08:25,190 --> 02:08:25,970
Don't go.

3055
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:28,010
Oh no.

3056
02:08:29,030 --> 02:08:30,570
King Jeb, please.

3057
02:08:30,650 --> 02:08:31,530
That's your daughter.

3058
02:08:31,610 --> 02:08:32,850
Why are you so calm?

3059
02:08:36,230 --> 02:08:37,550
Oh shit.

3060
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:44,930
What gives?

3061
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:46,950
That kick was on another level.

3062
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,110
That scrawny girl actually hurt Prince?

3063
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:53,690
Was she always that strong?

3064
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:02,120
Is she ok?

3065
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:04,980
Is she a thorn?

3066
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:10,560
A thorn.

3067
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:11,240
Am I?

3068
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:14,080
Princess.

3069
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:14,320
Am I?

3070
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,260
Thorn.

3071
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:27,990
Is that what it is?

3072
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:38,900
Oh!

3073
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:44,640
Why wouldn't he control the demon instead of the fucking girl?

3074
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:55,980
Oh, he can only control humans!

3075
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:02,500
He shot a child.

3076
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,120
Oh my god.

3077
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:10,980
What?

3078
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:12,960
Wait, he can't control demons?

3079
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,340
What?

3080
02:10:27,890 --> 02:10:28,900
That's an angel?

3081
02:10:49,810 --> 02:10:50,810
Oh my god.

3082
02:10:51,070 --> 02:10:51,470
Oh my god.

3083
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:52,870
He is controlling the demon!

3084
02:10:53,390 --> 02:10:54,010
Oh my god!

3085
02:10:54,110 --> 02:10:55,390
I gave him the wrong ideas!

3086
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:58,590
I mean, they're pretty good ideas, but like, not to the enemy!

3087
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,210
I don't think he's human.

3088
02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:03,290
He has to be an angel then.

3089
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:06,570
Because he's like, I'm gonna turn you to a path of righteousness.

3090
02:11:08,270 --> 02:11:09,230
And let's go!

3091
02:11:09,450 --> 02:11:09,870
Let's go!

3092
02:11:09,890 --> 02:11:11,790
Let's go!

3093
02:11:12,370 --> 02:11:12,990
But...

3094
02:11:15,270 --> 02:11:16,210
It's fine!

3095
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:17,470
Just go!

3096
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:21,220
No.

3097
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,240
I trust you.

3098
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:25,040
Oh my god, bro, what?

3099
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:27,080
Bro, he's being controlled right now.

3100
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:27,760
He's like, no.

3101
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:29,760
You can't fight the control!

3102
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:31,340
That's like so much...

3103
02:11:31,930 --> 02:11:35,060
That's like so much, like, gamble right now.

3104
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:37,780
Now, let's do this.

3105
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:40,280
I'll blow you into outer space!

3106
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:44,340
I'll blow you into outer space!

3107
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:46,880
Don't worry.

3108
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:48,640
I got a tank.

3109
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:50,720
Give me a sec.

3110
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:52,340
Give me a sec.

3111
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:54,140
I can't put my tank out.

3112
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:55,000
Oh, okay.

3113
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:55,880
Nevermind.

3114
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:57,960
I gotta fight you with my fists.

3115
02:11:58,260 --> 02:11:59,780
Child versus child.

3116
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,700
Take that!

3117
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:05,560
That's right, child!

3118
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:09,380
So far so good.

3119
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:10,660
Here we go.

3120
02:12:10,660 --> 02:12:10,740
Oh shit.

3121
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:12,800
Take that!

3122
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:17,980
I don't remember how to normally fight, but I can smash buttons!

3123
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:23,060
But I know how to mash.

3124
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:25,440
That's fucking right.

3125
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:33,140
I don't know what I'm doing.

3126
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,360
I'm just funny.

3127
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:41,680
If Tekken has taught me anything, just be unpredictable.

3128
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:48,400
That's fucking right.

3129
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:50,000
And I can drink water.

3130
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:51,160
I don't know how to drink water.

3131
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:54,680
Guys, how do I drink water to the game?

3132
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,420
I don't remember how to hydrate!

3133
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:59,320
Guys, how do I hydrate?

3134
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:03,420
Guys, we need to hydrate!

3135
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:04,340
We need to hydrate!

3136
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,040
Guys, I can't drink water!

3137
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:18,600
Guys, how do I drink water?

3138
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:23,760
Okay, dark energy repair kit.

3139
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:24,720
Oh no.

3140
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:26,880
Oh no, okay.

3141
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:32,000
How do I... oh, health drink.

3142
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,980
Oh thank god.

3143
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:34,340
Okay, we got the health drink.

3144
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:37,680
Okay.

3145
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:38,560
Okay, there we go.

3146
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,220
Guys, I figured it out.

3147
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:42,820
I don't know how to drink water, but I figured this out.

3148
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:45,520
No!

3149
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:47,940
No!

3150
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:53,830
Oh, this is awkward.

3151
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:55,250
This is awkward.

3152
02:13:57,110 --> 02:13:58,270
Give me a... oh!

3153
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:00,710
Okay.

3154
02:14:00,710 --> 02:14:01,170
Okay.

3155
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:03,510
We're drinking all the heals right now.

3156
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,950
Oh god.

3157
02:14:05,790 --> 02:14:07,370
Oh my god.

3158
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:10,690
I don't remember how to drink water!

3159
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:12,430
No!

3160
02:14:12,730 --> 02:14:13,310
He jumped!

3161
02:14:14,770 --> 02:14:15,970
That's not fair!

3162
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:19,310
Oh god.

3163
02:14:19,450 --> 02:14:20,610
That was not fair.

3164
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:21,690
He fucking jumped.

3165
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:24,710
Like, how the fuck was I supposed to deal with that?

3166
02:14:26,990 --> 02:14:30,590
This is... all the fucking thing was for this.

3167
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:33,430
Oh my god.

3168
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:36,910
Were these fumbos?

3169
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:37,890
Please, I'm trying!

3170
02:14:38,030 --> 02:14:40,690
I was in a tank for 90% of my life!

3171
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:44,590
It's not fair!

3172
02:14:46,510 --> 02:14:48,490
I was literally riding a tank!

3173
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:50,350
I didn't know how to use my fists!

3174
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:53,670
Oh god.

3175
02:14:54,110 --> 02:14:54,810
Oh god.

3176
02:14:55,950 --> 02:14:56,730
Okay, thank god.

3177
02:14:56,810 --> 02:14:57,450
We have another one.

3178
02:14:59,330 --> 02:14:59,770
Nice.

3179
02:15:00,890 --> 02:15:02,690
Shit, I brought some heals too, child.

3180
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:11,470
I blocked everything with my face.

3181
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:14,930
I'm okay.

3182
02:15:24,850 --> 02:15:26,590
Oh yeah, and all my heals too.

3183
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:35,590
Guys, I'm a bounty hunter, not a fist hunter.

3184
02:15:36,190 --> 02:15:39,470
Okay, I was gonna say not a fist hunter, but then I realized maybe I shouldn't say that.

3185
02:15:43,350 --> 02:15:44,030
I'm a bounty hunter, not a fist hunter.

3186
02:15:44,030 --> 02:15:44,610
Oh, I got picked up!

3187
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:47,210
Wait, what?

3188
02:15:54,820 --> 02:15:57,260
Wait, where's Anne?

3189
02:15:58,080 --> 02:15:59,080
And where's his dad?

3190
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:13,320
Wait, where's Anne?

3191
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:14,040
And where's his dad?

3192
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:17,840
And where's his dad?

3193
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:18,360
What are you doing, thief?

3194
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:25,610
And where's Anne's old man?

3195
02:16:25,990 --> 02:16:26,330
Yeah.

3196
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:29,130
Behind you.

3197
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:30,670
Is he in my tank?

3198
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:33,330
Wait, who's driving?

3199
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:34,470
It's my tank!

3200
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:40,450
Anne said she wanted to give it a try.

3201
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:44,390
She'd better not get my tank all beat up.

3202
02:16:44,390 --> 02:16:44,670
Yeah.

3203
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:47,390
No cars allowed in my tank.

3204
02:16:47,390 --> 02:16:49,310
That was close, Prince.

3205
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:52,430
Muneo had you up against the wall back there.

3206
02:16:54,330 --> 02:16:56,310
And get all the cooties in there!

3207
02:16:56,930 --> 02:16:56,950
There's no way he's a human.

3208
02:16:57,070 --> 02:16:58,730
He's much too powerful.

3209
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:03,390
Yup, you got that right.

3210
02:17:04,910 --> 02:17:06,970
Because he's not human.

3211
02:17:08,090 --> 02:17:08,710
What?

3212
02:17:09,390 --> 02:17:10,810
Then what is he?

3213
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:12,390
He's an angel.

3214
02:17:12,930 --> 02:17:13,650
He's a demon?

3215
02:17:13,650 --> 02:17:15,030
If there's demons, there's angels.

3216
02:17:15,690 --> 02:17:16,170
No.

3217
02:17:17,390 --> 02:17:18,430
Muneo is...

3218
02:17:21,990 --> 02:17:23,250
an angel.

3219
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:25,210
No way!

3220
02:17:26,190 --> 02:17:31,070
Oh my plot twist of the century that we read like 30 minutes ago!

3221
02:17:34,730 --> 02:17:35,610
No way!

3222
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:37,510
Really?

3223
02:17:39,970 --> 02:17:42,590
Long ago, everyone...

3224
02:17:42,590 --> 02:17:46,750
you have all had to bear so much over the last 10 years.

3225
02:17:47,210 --> 02:17:48,770
This is not a king.

3226
02:17:50,550 --> 02:17:51,070
You've been through it.

3227
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:52,570
I'm sorry I put you through this.

3228
02:17:53,710 --> 02:17:55,670
You're just like a regular dad!

3229
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:56,430
You're an angel!

3230
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:56,470
What's wrong with you?

3231
02:17:56,490 --> 02:17:56,990
He looks like a regular dad!

3232
02:17:56,990 --> 02:17:57,450
I'm sorry I put you through this.

3233
02:17:57,450 --> 02:18:02,690
I like how everybody has their outfits are like, what's it called?

3234
02:18:03,170 --> 02:18:09,290
Like, um, Semi-fantasy Mad Max-style type deal.

3235
02:18:09,470 --> 02:18:13,850
And then he just looks like some guy from 2024 just working from the office.

3236
02:18:14,110 --> 02:18:14,290
He must be tired.

3237
02:18:14,310 --> 02:18:16,250
Please, get some rest.

3238
02:18:16,470 --> 02:18:16,910
You must be tired.

3239
02:18:16,910 --> 02:18:18,130
He looks like an isekai person.

3240
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,730
You got isekai from the office.

3241
02:18:19,850 --> 02:18:19,890
Indeed.

3242
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:24,690
We did it!

3243
02:18:24,750 --> 02:18:27,450
We reunited with King Jam and Anne!

3244
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:33,550
Yeah, post-apocalyptic outfits and then there's fucking King Jam.

3245
02:18:34,350 --> 02:18:36,090
Being like, just clocked out!

3246
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:37,730
From my 9 to 5!

3247
02:18:41,390 --> 02:18:43,870
Just got out from my 9 to 5, guys!

3248
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:45,130
It's great.

3249
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:51,630
Let's see... where do we have to go?

3250
02:18:51,630 --> 02:18:53,610
Who do we have to talk to?

3251
02:18:54,390 --> 02:18:55,170
Over there?

3252
02:18:55,430 --> 02:18:55,950
How do we get... oh.

3253
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:57,250
Okay, we go from here.

3254
02:18:59,610 --> 02:19:01,270
He's the family king.

3255
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:04,350
He's king of the office.

3256
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:13,630
He was a prisoner for 10 years?!

3257
02:19:21,630 --> 02:19:23,730
And the big red will take the king's escape sitting down.

3258
02:19:24,870 --> 02:19:28,230
We have to protect King Jam and the last of the Equanium.

3259
02:19:29,370 --> 02:19:31,570
But the radar only showed 4 spots.

3260
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:33,470
The fifth is a mystery.

3261
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:35,410
I know, how does his hair...

3262
02:19:35,410 --> 02:19:37,010
They just be like regular...

3263
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:38,090
He's an angel guys.

3264
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:39,170
The angel was like...

3265
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:40,470
Time for your regular haircut.

3266
02:19:41,550 --> 02:19:42,430
And grooming.

3267
02:19:42,570 --> 02:19:45,390
How did he magically keep such a clean hair...

3268
02:19:45,390 --> 02:19:47,310
like... mustache for 10 years.

3269
02:19:47,850 --> 02:19:50,070
You mean you know where the Equanium is?

3270
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:51,430
You know what the Equanium is?

3271
02:20:04,270 --> 02:20:05,470
My dad?

3272
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:07,170
What am I, chopped liver?

3273
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:12,850
True.

3274
02:20:18,030 --> 02:20:18,890
I knew it!

3275
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:19,930
Ask me the dad!

3276
02:20:24,110 --> 02:20:26,090
I mean, your sister's dead.

3277
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:31,050
Oh my god, yeah!

3278
02:20:31,330 --> 02:20:33,690
How did you like hook up with his sister?

3279
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:40,890
I wanna know, how did you hook up with his sister?

3280
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:43,590
Tell the child!

3281
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:44,130
Hi!

3282
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:45,250
Welcome to Tamaya Farm!

3283
02:20:45,370 --> 02:20:45,770
Welcome, welcome!

3284
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:49,170
Wait, she's not pink!

3285
02:20:50,830 --> 02:20:52,290
Look, you can't just say that.

3286
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:54,090
You can't just say why she's not pink.

3287
02:20:57,490 --> 02:20:59,650
See, he's wearing a uniform!

3288
02:21:01,270 --> 02:21:06,830
Now that looks, okay, the upside, the glasses and the mustache and that not really look like a king.

3289
02:21:06,930 --> 02:21:09,150
But the bottom half looks like a king now.

3290
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:16,510
Now he looks official.

3291
02:21:22,330 --> 02:21:23,590
Oh, is this the queenium?

3292
02:21:26,790 --> 02:21:29,270
It has an age in 10 years, that's true.

3293
02:21:29,490 --> 02:21:33,090
I can't believe they let him have hair dye too, to keep his hair.

3294
02:21:35,430 --> 02:21:36,550
Oh, that's Lilith!

3295
02:21:55,670 --> 02:22:01,330
Oh, she has the fusion earring.

3296
02:22:02,050 --> 02:22:04,590
Oh my god,

3297
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:10,510
this weapon mass destruction.

3298
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:12,210
It's so beautiful!

3299
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:22,140
The queenium?

3300
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:27,760
That incredibly dangerous material that produces immense energy?

3301
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:31,940
Lilith has been alive for millennia.

3302
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:34,900
If she recognizes it, I'm sure she's right.

3303
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:36,380
He's a mill hunter.

3304
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:43,960
Perhaps the previous king kept it in the event of an emergency.

3305
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:50,860
You know, I've heard rumors that the queenium was the cause of that terrible explosion in Sandland.

3306
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:51,580
All those rumors.

3307
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:54,680
I think we should hide it.

3308
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:56,000
Respect.

3309
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:02,140
If bread knew of its existence, he'd surely use it as a weapon.

3310
02:23:03,140 --> 02:23:04,860
So we can't keep it close to him.

3311
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:06,640
I mean, that's a lot of pressure for him, you know?

3312
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:10,460
For his wife to be around for a millennia?

3313
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:13,120
That's gotta be a lot of pressure for him.

3314
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:14,220
You couldn't ask your father to keep it safe?

3315
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:18,020
King Lucifer.

3316
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:20,780
How did she hide her pointy ears?

3317
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:28,080
Like... like she got everything under disguise but the pointy ears.

3318
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:29,480
What would the people say about that?

3319
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:33,240
Of course not.

3320
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:38,580
To be honest, she has a point.

3321
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:41,580
I can't imagine a safer place to keep it.

3322
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:45,140
And don't you worry about the key either.

3323
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:47,500
I'll keep it as close as ever.

3324
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:48,780
Then she dies.

3325
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:53,990
And that's...

3326
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:54,550
What happened?

3327
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:57,430
Did your father tell you about any of this?

3328
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:01,310
Did you know about this, thief?

3329
02:24:02,770 --> 02:24:04,830
We finally figured out what she looked like!

3330
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:06,270
This is the first I'm hearing of this.

3331
02:24:07,570 --> 02:24:09,450
Wait, how does she have blonde hair?

3332
02:24:10,450 --> 02:24:13,190
Where the f- Wait a minute!

3333
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:19,930
Anne has blonde hair, Lilith has red hair, and Jem has black hair!

3334
02:24:20,450 --> 02:24:21,670
Wait a minute!

3335
02:24:22,790 --> 02:24:27,690
I just- I just- You ruined it!

3336
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:29,690
Wait a minute!

3337
02:24:31,350 --> 02:24:33,810
Something doesn't add up.

3338
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:35,730
I just noticed.

3339
02:24:36,530 --> 02:24:37,330
Yeah.

3340
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:44,270
Wait a minute, Anne!

3341
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:50,810
I can't believe my necklace was the key to the aquarium chest.

3342
02:24:50,830 --> 02:24:52,310
It's fucking weird shaped.

3343
02:24:52,310 --> 02:24:56,290
So like, we had a feeling it was a lock for something.

3344
02:24:56,610 --> 02:24:58,110
Well, as long as it's been left by my dad, it's in safe hands.

3345
02:24:59,330 --> 02:25:03,450
So we've been going around collecting aquarium like mad for nothing?

3346
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:06,010
Well, it's still a dangerous material.

3347
02:25:06,010 --> 02:25:06,470
What do you mean?

3348
02:25:07,090 --> 02:25:08,350
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3349
02:25:08,630 --> 02:25:14,690
Even if we have to give up on reactivating Gaara, it gets to do terrible damage just by using it for its explosive properties.

3350
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:16,190
We have to find the aquarium for the other people.

3351
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:19,750
So there's no change in our to-do list even with my father freed.

3352
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:22,730
I like things nice and simple.

3353
02:25:24,030 --> 02:25:27,490
We'll get rid of that stupid angel and get the aquarium back.

3354
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:28,170
Yeah!

3355
02:25:28,750 --> 02:25:29,990
Which stupid angel?

3356
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:31,910
Wait, there's more than one?

3357
02:25:32,570 --> 02:25:33,170
Okay.

3358
02:25:33,390 --> 02:25:35,330
Wait, Moonio's an angel?

3359
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:36,130
What?

3360
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:37,710
Was she not there?

3361
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:40,090
Makes sense.

3362
02:25:40,670 --> 02:25:43,110
Lady Lilith wouldn't lose to a human.

3363
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:45,670
Mother.

3364
02:25:46,910 --> 02:25:49,730
Well, we'll need to replenish our energy if we want to.

3365
02:25:52,310 --> 02:25:53,470
Oh, she was in the tank?

3366
02:25:53,630 --> 02:25:53,970
Oh yeah!

3367
02:25:55,870 --> 02:25:57,450
I'll take a spot on the floor too.

3368
02:25:57,930 --> 02:25:59,290
I almost forgot she was in the tank.

3369
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:00,790
I thought she was with us.

3370
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:03,530
I always assumed she was always with us for some reason.

3371
02:26:03,730 --> 02:26:04,630
Even though she was driving...

3372
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:06,550
Even though we all heard her driving the tank.

3373
02:26:06,690 --> 02:26:08,030
I was like, she's with us, guys!

3374
02:26:08,730 --> 02:26:09,690
Oh wait, there's stuff here.

3375
02:26:10,930 --> 02:26:11,250
Okay.

3376
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:12,610
Hit the hay.

3377
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:15,170
How do I...

3378
02:26:16,190 --> 02:26:17,190
Oh, I have to go back.

3379
02:26:17,570 --> 02:26:18,970
Wait, where is...

3380
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:20,330
How do I get up there?

3381
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:22,710
I guess this way?

3382
02:26:24,190 --> 02:26:25,110
Oh, it's this way.

3383
02:26:25,230 --> 02:26:25,410
Okay.

3384
02:26:25,810 --> 02:26:26,850
I was gonna say...

3385
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:29,610
How do I get to the fucking sleeping quarters?

3386
02:26:30,650 --> 02:26:31,890
Okay, I'm gonna rob you guys.

3387
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:32,270
Boop!

3388
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:33,050
My stuff now!

3389
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:35,230
My friend's the queen.

3390
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:36,810
Or the princess.

3391
02:26:37,070 --> 02:26:38,750
I mean, she's practically the queen now.

3392
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,750
So I can rob you guys.

3393
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:43,230
Cause that's my friend's stuff.

3394
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:45,830
Wait, how did you get here?

3395
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:46,530
What?

3396
02:26:46,650 --> 02:26:47,190
Weren't you downstairs?

3397
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:50,610
Oh, Prince.

3398
02:26:50,850 --> 02:26:52,350
Are you going to sleep already?

3399
02:26:52,610 --> 02:26:52,990
Yeah.

3400
02:26:53,730 --> 02:26:54,490
Yeah, I am.

3401
02:26:55,350 --> 02:26:55,790
Goodnight.

3402
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,620
What was that?

3403
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:09,720
Oh yeah, she's my niece.

3404
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:10,560
Yeah, that's right.

3405
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:12,120
That means I can steal everything.

3406
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:13,480
Everything that's here is mine.

3407
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:14,960
What happened?

3408
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:15,980
Yeah, what happened?

3409
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:17,640
Oh, now he's in the outfit?

3410
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:18,680
Now he's not a...

3411
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:19,820
Oh my god, finally!

3412
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:21,600
Okay, now he sort of fits in.

3413
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:21,980
Gone!

3414
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:23,540
Oh my god, gone!

3415
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:23,800
Gone!

3416
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:27,080
Are you sure?

3417
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:29,240
Maybe you just put it down somewhere.

3418
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:32,200
That's not it!

3419
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:35,840
I left it on my pillow, but now I can't find it anywhere!

3420
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:37,000
On your pillow?

3421
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:38,660
You took it off?

3422
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:42,040
What now?

3423
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:45,500
He's gone!

3424
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:47,200
Eppy's gone!

3425
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:48,260
Eppy?

3426
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:49,000
Who's Eppy?

3427
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:49,920
What?

3428
02:27:50,460 --> 02:27:52,080
How could you let him escape?

3429
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:52,920
Oh, it's the General!

3430
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:56,420
I didn't let him escape, he just got away!

3431
02:27:57,240 --> 02:27:58,780
Yeah, why would you take it off?

3432
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:00,480
It's the same thing, you idiot!

3433
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:05,020
And the day after King Jam told us what it does.

3434
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:09,000
The timing's far too convenient to be coincidental.

3435
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:09,580
There's a spy.

3436
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:13,160
Do you think it was Eppy who stole the necklace?

3437
02:28:13,480 --> 02:28:15,720
It has to be, because Eppy wasn't there to listen to us.

3438
02:28:16,380 --> 02:28:19,320
Knowing Eppy, I wouldn't put it past him.

3439
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:20,780
There's a spy here.

3440
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:22,400
It could be you.

3441
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:23,100
It could be me.

3442
02:28:23,220 --> 02:28:24,220
It could even be...

3443
02:28:24,780 --> 02:28:25,560
I'll give it a shot.

3444
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:27,820
I can think of a few routes he could have taken.

3445
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,240
Prince, we're going back to Sandland.

3446
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:33,480
No!

3447
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:34,920
What the fuck?

3448
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,400
I was only in Forsyth for like ten seconds!

3449
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,640
The first place they'll go is Demon Village.

3450
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:41,860
So?

3451
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:43,020
My dad's there.

3452
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,480
He'll take care of it.

3453
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:49,140
When it comes to Aquanium, we can't take anything from it.

3454
02:28:49,140 --> 02:28:49,840
Oh, Raul!

3455
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:52,880
Sounds like a waste of time to me.

3456
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:55,100
Why do we keep going back to Sandland?

3457
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:57,760
I thought we were free from Sandland!

3458
02:28:58,060 --> 02:29:00,440
And then they put me back into the sand!

3459
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:02,480
Every time!

3460
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:06,420
You can never leave Sandland.

3461
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:09,260
Okay, we gotta get his HP up, that's for sure.

3462
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:11,080
Oh, I have four skill points?

3463
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:13,260
I was not paying any attention.

3464
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:13,960
Okay.

3465
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:17,180
We're gonna raise the Darkness attack.

3466
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:18,520
And...

3467
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:20,680
We're gonna raise the Darkness.

3468
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:24,240
And we're not gonna do anything regarding the rock.

3469
02:29:24,420 --> 02:29:26,880
Because I have no idea how to use the rock.

3470
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:30,600
And then, oh my god, we can finally upgrade you, Anne.

3471
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,800
Recover HP increases?

3472
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:34,920
Okay, we need to increase that.

3473
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:36,320
And then...

3474
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:38,700
Limit Time Boost consumes no energy.

3475
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:40,120
Ooh, that's really good.

3476
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:41,740
I'm gonna fucking upgrade all of Anne's stuff.

3477
02:29:41,980 --> 02:29:44,480
Recover HP for Beelzebub's vehicles?

3478
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:45,220
Yes!

3479
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:47,280
Appearant Breakdowns and other stats.

3480
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,040
Insanely... Instantly reloads.

3481
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:49,500
Ooh!

3482
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:51,300
Instant reload ammo!

3483
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:54,540
Reduces cooldown for quick reload.

3484
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:55,160
Nice.

3485
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:55,440
Okay.

3486
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:57,180
That's really good.

3487
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:00,060
Finally, actual useful skills.

3488
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:01,540
Ginger, thank you for the super chat!

3489
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:02,420
Thank you, thank you!

3490
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:05,800
Let's back to the sand.

3491
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:09,640
Where's the mission?

3492
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,700
So I have to go back to the sand.

3493
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:13,800
Oh, there it is.

3494
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:14,240
Is that it?

3495
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:16,120
No, that's the flowers.

3496
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:17,320
Oh, I always forget about the flowers.

3497
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:18,680
Oh, I always forget about the flowers.

3498
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:18,940
Oh, I always forget about the flowers.

3499
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,360
Wait, where is the mission?

3500
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:23,220
Oh, it's over here.

3501
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:25,200
The demon village.

3502
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:26,780
God, it's so far.

3503
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:30,280
Dad, I'm home!

3504
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:33,760
I'm home, Dad.

3505
02:30:36,820 --> 02:30:38,180
Did you miss me?

3506
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,860
I brought your...

3507
02:30:40,980 --> 02:30:41,540
Uhhh...

3508
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:42,860
Grammys?

3509
02:30:43,900 --> 02:30:45,040
No, your grandchild!

3510
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:46,720
I brought your grandchild!

3511
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:48,180
Hell!

3512
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:50,260
Wait, it's not supposed to be like this?

3513
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:54,520
Oh, I assumed it was supposed to be like this because it's like hell.

3514
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:05,220
I thought it was supposed to be like that because it's hell!

3515
02:31:06,140 --> 02:31:08,480
I didn't realize it was not supposed to.

3516
02:31:14,830 --> 02:31:16,070
Gremlin, what's going on?

3517
02:31:16,070 --> 02:31:19,850
The human piloted bot dropped bug monsters all over the villains!

3518
02:31:19,990 --> 02:31:21,250
Oh, it's the bug things!

3519
02:31:21,650 --> 02:31:24,050
I've never seen creatures like them in Sand Land before.

3520
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:28,110
Yeah, but it's where the demons live!

3521
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:32,430
The attackers went for the underground ruins.

3522
02:31:33,810 --> 02:31:35,470
You go on ahead, Prince.

3523
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:37,650
I'll join you once I get patched up.

3524
02:31:38,490 --> 02:31:38,950
Okay.

3525
02:31:40,350 --> 02:31:41,470
I have to go this way.

3526
02:31:42,770 --> 02:31:43,570
Oh my god!

3527
02:31:43,670 --> 02:31:46,050
I honestly thought that's what hell was supposed to look like.

3528
02:31:46,070 --> 02:31:49,930
Are you okay, Slime?

3529
02:31:50,150 --> 02:31:51,050
Slime, are you okay?

3530
02:31:54,730 --> 02:31:56,610
Oh my god, he's gonna evaporate!

3531
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:00,630
Wait, is this the guy that likes the singing?

3532
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:01,730
No, that's a different guy.

3533
02:32:03,570 --> 02:32:04,830
Alright, it's this way.

3534
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:20,070
Oh, no.

3535
02:32:20,190 --> 02:32:20,810
We gotta...

3536
02:32:21,450 --> 02:32:23,010
We gotta hope Dad's okay!

3537
02:32:24,470 --> 02:32:25,550
Is up down?

3538
02:32:25,850 --> 02:32:26,630
Yeah, up is down.

3539
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:29,210
Okay, I always have to remember if up is down.

3540
02:32:30,830 --> 02:32:32,390
Dad, are you okay, Dad?

3541
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:35,190
Dad!

3542
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:36,650
Sorry, I was trying to see it.

3543
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:37,450
I forgot to run.

3544
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:41,590
Dad!

3545
02:32:44,650 --> 02:32:46,770
I have your grandchild here!

3546
02:32:49,710 --> 02:32:50,270
RUN!

3547
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:51,990
It's the last piece of live that we have!

3548
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:53,910
What

3549
02:33:00,080 --> 02:33:01,780
are you doing?

3550
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,580
Attack him as one!

3551
02:33:09,660 --> 02:33:11,320
Quique-quique-quique!

3552
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:13,400
Dammit!

3553
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:15,940
The final piece of Aquanium...

3554
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:16,180
Dammit!

3555
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:16,180
The final piece of Aquanium...

3556
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:17,240
is so close!

3557
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:20,200
Moonia!

3558
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:20,900
Can you confuse your heart with manipulation?

3559
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:21,140
Moonia!

3560
02:33:21,140 --> 02:33:21,560
Can you confuse your heart with manipulation?

3561
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:21,560
Moonia!

3562
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:22,080
Can you confuse your heart with manipulation?

3563
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:24,480
Wait then, who's Bred?

3564
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:25,980
Is Bred also an angel?

3565
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:27,340
I'm already using it but...

3566
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:32,440
Yeah, because we got a baby angel.

3567
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:33,460
Baby angel!

3568
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,380
Baby angel!

3569
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:51,940
Not the widescreen TV!

3570
02:33:52,220 --> 02:33:52,540
Oh yeah!

3571
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:54,700
Oh yeah, he was like the cyborg guy.

3572
02:33:54,740 --> 02:33:54,960
I forgot.

3573
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:57,180
Sorry, he's so forgettable as a character.

3574
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:09,320
Okay, you broke his TV!

3575
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:12,940
Like, you broke into his home and broke his TV!

3576
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:13,560
Like...

3577
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:17,760
And he's the bad guy?!

3578
02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:23,460
What the fuck?!

3579
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:23,600
He...

3580
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:24,260
Wait!

3581
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:24,940
Is he...

3582
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:29,260
Is he mad because his revenge is based off the TV?!

3583
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:37,400
He started an entire war because he broke a guy's TV!

3584
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:43,900
What a story.

3585
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:46,120
That's the plot!

3586
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:57,810
Poor TV!

3587
02:34:57,810 --> 02:34:58,110
Poor TV!

3588
02:35:02,890 --> 02:35:04,710
Millions of people died!

3589
02:35:06,050 --> 02:35:07,160
Water was...

3590
02:35:08,470 --> 02:35:16,850
Was withheld from an entire country because an angel got beat up because he broke a devil's TV!

3591
02:35:19,430 --> 02:35:21,430
He killed Lilith!

3592
02:35:24,570 --> 02:35:25,250
BABBA!

3593
02:35:25,310 --> 02:35:26,150
WATCH OUT!

3594
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:28,150
Dad, no!

3595
02:35:28,670 --> 02:35:28,790
You're done!

3596
02:35:29,950 --> 02:35:31,970
It was a smart TV!

3597
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:32,710
Doki!

3598
02:35:32,910 --> 02:35:33,830
You don't understand!

3599
02:35:36,710 --> 02:35:38,670
Millions of people died...

3600
02:35:40,490 --> 02:35:42,370
Because of a TV.

3601
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:49,180
No!

3602
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:50,520
Such toughness!

3603
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:53,540
I never dreamt the King of Demons could be this good!

3604
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:55,340
Bro, this guy is literally the king of demons!

3605
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:56,380
What do you mean?!

3606
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:56,720
Brad!

3607
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:03,580
His favorite show is gonna air.

3608
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:06,120
He got the- wait.

3609
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:08,020
Oh no!

3610
02:36:09,380 --> 02:36:09,980
What?

3611
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:20,560
Oh my god!

3612
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:22,240
Not the ceiling, Earn!

3613
02:36:24,260 --> 02:36:26,200
Where did he get that?

3614
02:36:26,820 --> 02:36:27,760
The bird!

3615
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:28,080
No!

3616
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:47,020
He's gonna eat- what the fuck?!

3617
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:51,820
He just ate him!

3618
02:36:56,980 --> 02:36:58,320
What the fuck?

3619
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:10,540
And while I'm at it, I might as well get rid of his bread too, huh?

3620
02:37:11,780 --> 02:37:12,300
What?

3621
02:37:12,460 --> 02:37:13,900
You little twerp!

3622
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:15,380
He just ate Lucifer?

3623
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:16,400
It's that easy?!

3624
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:18,100
Stand back, everyone!

3625
02:37:18,580 --> 02:37:20,720
You can just eat Lucifer?

3626
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:23,320
Oh no, not again!

3627
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:24,280
Not round two!

3628
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:25,820
Oh no!

3629
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:27,640
I don't ever give in to an angel shrimp like you!

3630
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:29,780
This is bad, guys.

3631
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:33,980
I was not ready for- I was not ready for round two of this!

3632
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:35,380
I did not stock up!

3633
02:37:35,380 --> 02:37:35,680
No!

3634
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:39,020
I didn't stock up!

3635
02:37:41,060 --> 02:37:41,620
Guys!

3636
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:49,100
I didn't stock up on his!

3637
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:51,000
Oh, this- I'm so fucked.

3638
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:54,580
Guys, how do you block again, guys?

3639
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:55,560
I don't remember.

3640
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:02,000
I thought- I thought- I thought I'd be using my tank!

3641
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,460
What is this?!

3642
02:38:08,100 --> 02:38:09,900
Just give in already.

3643
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:11,440
Oh no!

3644
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:15,660
What do you mean I can't use my tank?!

3645
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:19,600
Here it comes!

3646
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:20,400
Oh god.

3647
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:24,020
Oh god.

3648
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:26,000
Where are my allies?!

3649
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:29,600
Do you think a fiend like you ever stood a chance against an archangel?

3650
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:31,800
Okay, nice.

3651
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:34,020
Archangel my butt, you little runt!

3652
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:35,280
Oh my god!

3653
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:36,380
There's other attacks!

3654
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:38,660
I figured it out!

3655
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:41,220
Where did I figure it out?

3656
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:42,620
So far, so good!

3657
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:43,820
Oh shit!

3658
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:45,400
I figured it out!

3659
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:47,100
There's other attacks, guys!

3660
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:49,180
You angel runt!

3661
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:51,640
Oh my god, guys!

3662
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:53,100
I figured it out on the floor!

3663
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:56,700
Here we go!

3664
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:57,340
Oh my god!

3665
02:38:57,780 --> 02:38:58,420
Let's go!

3666
02:38:58,420 --> 02:39:01,920
I figured out the other movesets!

3667
02:39:04,820 --> 02:39:06,240
Guys, I'm doing better!

3668
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:11,520
Holy shit!

3669
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:11,940
Here we go!

3670
02:39:14,700 --> 02:39:16,600
The last pause!

3671
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:17,580
Let's fucking go!

3672
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:19,100
Look!

3673
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:21,320
After getting spoiled with tank!

3674
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:22,100
Nah.

3675
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:25,400
After vanquishing Lucifer, you lot aren't even worth it.

3676
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:26,380
I'm playing Tekken!

3677
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:27,880
Huh?

3678
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:30,120
You're beneath me!

3679
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:32,560
Insectmen are more than enough to do this!

3680
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:33,260
I beat your ass!

3681
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:34,220
Child!

3682
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:35,800
Hey!

3683
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:36,700
Get back here!

3684
02:39:36,740 --> 02:39:39,080
You really won because you ate my dad!

3685
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:41,920
What the fuck?

3686
02:39:41,940 --> 02:39:42,860
Why is he herb-er?

3687
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:03,200
Looks like all the other equations.

3688
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:07,040
Why didn't you make an herb-er bug?

3689
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:08,840
It looks like the price is ours.

3690
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:15,200
Then, let's be on our way.

3691
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:38,940
What the fuck is Garum?

3692
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:44,600
What the fuck is Garum?

3693
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:45,240
Walks away.

3694
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:50,820
Looks like we gotta take care of these guys first.

3695
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:55,220
Can I bring my tank now?

3696
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:56,700
Am I allowed to have my tank?

3697
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:58,140
Oh, thank God!

3698
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:00,300
Oh, thank God, thank you!

3699
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:02,640
Oh, thank God!

3700
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:05,960
Oh, my God!

3701
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:07,940
Thank you!

3702
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:09,900
Why could I bring this earlier?

3703
02:41:13,540 --> 02:41:15,900
Okay, not gonna lie, why couldn't I not?

3704
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:17,620
Why couldn't I not bring this earlier to the fight?

3705
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:19,040
This does not make sense.

3706
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:21,980
Holy shit, he's literally just one hit!

3707
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:28,340
Yeah, like, the insect men are so scary.

3708
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:32,380
Alright.

3709
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:37,960
Why bro looking like Salazar from Resident Evil 4?

3710
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:40,060
Dr. Crabbear, thank you for the super chat!

3711
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:40,960
Thank you, thank you!

3712
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:42,360
Oh, my God, he does!

3713
02:41:44,260 --> 02:41:45,700
So you can't trust him.

3714
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:47,680
I was like, what is this little twerp doing?

3715
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:49,740
Kick his ass.

3716
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:09,460
I'm king now!

3717
02:42:12,340 --> 02:42:14,700
Bro, you just found out he's your grandpa.

3718
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:16,920
This is it!

3719
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:17,580
It's over!

3720
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:27,340
I'm sorry about Lady Lilith, but the King of Demons has not been taken out.

3721
02:42:27,340 --> 02:42:29,320
Yeah, cause I'm king now!

3722
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:36,440
From what Mooniel said, that urn only seems capable of sealing Lucifer away.

3723
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:41,520
The King of Demons may be trapped, but he should still be alive.

3724
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:42,820
Probably.

3725
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:48,140
So if we take the urn back from that brat, we can still fix this?

3726
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:49,000
How do we take it?

3727
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:50,760
It's literally getting digested right now.

3728
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:52,780
He has to use the bathroom!

3729
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:57,520
Do angels need to use the bathroom?

3730
02:42:57,700 --> 02:42:58,640
We'll find out soon!

3731
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,780
We've gotta let the Trick Camp guys know about this.

3732
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:07,220
Okay.

3733
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:09,440
I'll contact him right away.

3734
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:10,200
What do we have to do?

3735
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:11,260
Go back to the camp.

3736
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:11,680
Alright.

3737
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:16,140
We gotta find out if angels need to use the bathroom.

3738
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:20,840
What do you mean, don't you know?

3739
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,500
It's an honest question!

3740
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:25,380
How are we gonna get the urn out?

3741
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:30,760
Alright.

3742
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:38,960
We gotta go speak with everybody.

3743
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:42,880
Alright, nice.

3744
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:43,480
Wow!

3745
02:43:44,740 --> 02:43:46,140
That's a lot of stuff.

3746
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:48,520
That's not tank related.

3747
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:51,580
I don't need any of these.

3748
02:43:51,700 --> 02:43:52,660
That's not tank related.

3749
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:54,140
Okay, we need to buy...

3750
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:56,680
We need to buy HP.

3751
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:58,800
We're running out of heals.

3752
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:01,420
Alright, buy.

3753
02:44:03,480 --> 02:44:04,820
Okay, repair kit.

3754
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:05,960
Repair kit plus.

3755
02:44:07,080 --> 02:44:09,100
Okay, we're gonna buy this.

3756
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:11,600
And then we need to buy health serum.

3757
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:13,200
Because we don't have that anymore.

3758
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:14,960
Oh, we have so much money!

3759
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:17,360
That's good.

3760
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:18,540
Alright.

3761
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:20,060
We gotta replenish on this.

3762
02:44:21,660 --> 02:44:22,920
Uhhh... I guess I'll...

3763
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:25,300
Uhhh... We'll buy firepower.

3764
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:26,260
Oh, wait.

3765
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:26,420
No.

3766
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:28,160
Actually, let's get max firepower.

3767
02:44:28,740 --> 02:44:29,540
Alright, there we go.

3768
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:30,380
Thank you.

3769
02:44:31,620 --> 02:44:32,420
No problem.

3770
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:33,700
Alright, we gotta talk to him.

3771
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:35,560
Up we go.

3772
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:37,060
Okay.

3773
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:39,100
Climb up the ladder, bells.

3774
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:41,540
Climb up the ladder, bells!

3775
02:44:42,460 --> 02:44:42,900
Okay.

3776
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,060
Okay, we gotta tell Longo.

3777
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:46,680
Alright.

3778
02:44:46,680 --> 02:44:48,300
It's come down to this.

3779
02:44:48,440 --> 02:44:53,080
We must put everything on the line to stop Garm's reactivation.

3780
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:55,000
Is it even possible?

3781
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:56,420
Yeah, it's possible.

3782
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:02,380
This is the most destructive weapon in history.

3783
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:03,220
Jesus!

3784
02:45:03,220 --> 02:45:04,880
Which once sunk an entire continent.

3785
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,240
The flying fortress, Garm.

3786
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:08,160
Oh yeah, flatlands.

3787
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:12,180
And there's only one way inside it.

3788
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:14,300
That's a giant hole.

3789
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:14,940
I know.

3790
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:15,940
I was like, what the fuck?

3791
02:45:16,140 --> 02:45:19,060
You have to make your way to the lowest level of the Masala dig site where it's buried.

3792
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:21,340
And use the tunnel to its entrance there.

3793
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:26,580
But, with Bread and Muriel already headed for Garm.

3794
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:29,360
Jesus.

3795
02:45:32,820 --> 02:45:34,720
Sorry, I had to look at something.

3796
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:39,320
Their defenses will be so packed that not so much as a single plant could see through.

3797
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:43,820
We must be prepared to make sacrifices on our side.

3798
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:48,100
Though any member of the resistance...

3799
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:48,480
See?

3800
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:53,600
They're just like the rebel army.

3801
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:57,180
There's no more frightening enemy than one that doesn't know fear.

3802
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:02,180
Doesn't quite ring true coming from the man who won that war.

3803
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:06,120
I lost that war as badly as you did.

3804
02:46:07,140 --> 02:46:08,660
Yeah, nobody won in that war.

3805
02:46:08,660 --> 02:46:10,960
Literally entire cotton that is gone.

3806
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:16,740
Alright.

3807
02:46:20,580 --> 02:46:21,940
Then we gotta...

3808
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:24,560
Talk to...

3809
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:26,660
We gotta talk to whoever's over there.

3810
02:46:26,940 --> 02:46:27,900
I guess like the dad?

3811
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:29,360
Office dad?

3812
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:31,160
Office king?

3813
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:34,600
Office king!

3814
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,780
I don't know why I would tell you about what's going on.

3815
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:38,260
So even Lucifer has been bested.

3816
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:42,040
There's not a safe place left in this world.

3817
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:43,340
Then we'll make one.

3818
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:46,380
That's what we've been fighting for, right?

3819
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:46,680
Hmm.

3820
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:54,220
Though considering how many times I've almost lost hope, maybe that's not very convincing coming from me.

3821
02:46:54,700 --> 02:46:55,600
The people around us are the same as they were then.

3822
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:56,480
Ash, thank you for the super chat.

3823
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:56,820
Thank you.

3824
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:57,460
Thank you.

3825
02:46:59,020 --> 02:47:01,020
Is Doki Bird from Bumpland?

3826
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:01,480
Yeah!

3827
02:47:01,780 --> 02:47:02,860
That's where I'm from.

3828
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:06,180
I wish Lilith could have seen the person you've become.

3829
02:47:07,820 --> 02:47:08,360
Father...

3830
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:11,520
Let's give them some alone time.

3831
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:13,460
Yeah.

3832
02:47:13,460 --> 02:47:15,780
This might be the last time they see each other.

3833
02:47:16,380 --> 02:47:16,920
Huh?

3834
02:47:17,320 --> 02:47:17,860
Huh?

3835
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:18,860
What?

3836
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:19,560
What?

3837
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:22,580
Wait, what do you mean by that, Bizzlebug?

3838
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:24,200
Uh... nothing.

3839
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:25,700
The last time?

3840
02:47:25,820 --> 02:47:26,920
Who's gonna die?

3841
02:47:28,840 --> 02:47:30,500
What do you mean by that?

3842
02:47:30,660 --> 02:47:31,900
Somebody gonna die?

3843
02:47:34,280 --> 02:47:35,560
Oh my gosh.

3844
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:36,160
I coded it wrong.

3845
02:47:36,180 --> 02:47:37,280
Go down the ladder.

3846
02:47:40,220 --> 02:47:40,700
Alright.

3847
02:47:40,820 --> 02:47:42,260
Who else do I need to talk to?

3848
02:47:42,480 --> 02:47:43,760
Can I tell the swimmer?

3849
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:54,920
Where'd they left?

3850
02:48:00,460 --> 02:48:02,380
Are they running away or are they joining us?

3851
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:05,100
Oh, okay.

3852
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:05,680
They're joining us.

3853
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:07,600
I thought they like left us and they ran away.

3854
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:08,960
I'll be leaving soon myself.

3855
02:48:10,740 --> 02:48:14,420
King Jam, I leave this place in your capable hands.

3856
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:17,700
If there's anything I can do...

3857
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:18,540
No.

3858
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:20,080
This is your fight.

3859
02:48:20,840 --> 02:48:23,140
I'll be praying for your safety.

3860
02:48:27,290 --> 02:48:28,890
Swimmers, move out!

3861
02:48:30,210 --> 02:48:30,810
Alright!

3862
02:48:31,110 --> 02:48:31,550
Yeah!

3863
02:48:32,710 --> 02:48:33,910
Good luck to you.

3864
02:48:35,950 --> 02:48:37,010
You too.

3865
02:48:39,890 --> 02:48:41,530
We'd better get going as well.

3866
02:48:44,170 --> 02:48:46,990
Anne, I need you to come back alive.

3867
02:48:48,970 --> 02:48:50,030
I'll be fine.

3868
02:48:50,650 --> 02:48:52,490
Whose daughter do you think I am?

3869
02:48:52,510 --> 02:48:52,510
Yeah.

3870
02:48:52,510 --> 02:48:53,890
She can talk to animals.

3871
02:48:54,290 --> 02:48:56,930
Have we even used like her animal powers?

3872
02:48:56,990 --> 02:48:58,390
Like other than that one time?

3873
02:48:59,350 --> 02:49:02,870
And she's our king's granddaughter and princess' niece at that.

3874
02:49:04,290 --> 02:49:07,250
The fact that she can talk to animals but we only used it once?

3875
02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:09,050
I'm not going to put it that way.

3876
02:49:10,970 --> 02:49:11,410
Beelzebub.

3877
02:49:12,090 --> 02:49:12,530
Rao.

3878
02:49:14,490 --> 02:49:16,630
I won't ask you to protect her.

3879
02:49:16,750 --> 02:49:19,190
Just try not to let her be too...

3880
02:49:19,190 --> 02:49:20,370
You killed all the animals.

3881
02:49:20,430 --> 02:49:21,590
Who is she going to talk to?

3882
02:49:24,210 --> 02:49:24,650
Understood.

3883
02:49:25,710 --> 02:49:27,750
She talked to the flying dino too.

3884
02:49:28,910 --> 02:49:29,790
Did you...

3885
02:49:31,750 --> 02:49:32,190
That?

3886
02:49:33,170 --> 02:49:34,350
Alright, let's see.

3887
02:49:34,490 --> 02:49:35,330
Can I upgrade anything?

3888
02:49:35,650 --> 02:49:36,510
I don't know.

3889
02:49:36,970 --> 02:49:38,190
Just double checking.

3890
02:49:38,970 --> 02:49:41,890
Can I upgrade my... Yeah, everything's maxed out now.

3891
02:49:45,070 --> 02:49:45,630
Customize.

3892
02:49:48,910 --> 02:49:50,810
Apparently, these don't matter.

3893
02:49:50,990 --> 02:49:54,070
This gun is like the best overall so I'm not going to worry then.

3894
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:58,350
I'm just surprised I haven't got any of these... any better stuff here.

3895
02:49:58,550 --> 02:49:59,630
Bro, these guys.

3896
02:50:02,890 --> 02:50:03,210
25.

3897
02:50:03,370 --> 02:50:04,150
Thank you for the super chat.

3898
02:50:04,210 --> 02:50:04,450
Thank you.

3899
02:50:04,470 --> 02:50:04,990
Thank you.

3900
02:50:05,090 --> 02:50:08,190
I had a rough day today but after watching your stream, I feel better now.

3901
02:50:08,230 --> 02:50:09,590
Thank you so much and good luck with the rest of the stream.

3902
02:50:09,670 --> 02:50:10,110
Thank you.

3903
02:50:10,150 --> 02:50:11,290
Thank you for the super chat, 25.

3904
02:50:11,570 --> 02:50:13,410
I hope you feel... I'm glad you feel a lot better now.

3905
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:14,630
And I'm glad to cheer you up.

3906
02:50:14,730 --> 02:50:15,850
Thank you for the super chat.

3907
02:50:15,970 --> 02:50:16,190
Thank you.

3908
02:50:16,230 --> 02:50:16,710
Thank you.

3909
02:50:17,230 --> 02:50:18,110
Alright, here we go.

3910
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:20,730
We go straight to it.

3911
02:50:23,390 --> 02:50:26,270
I can feel the final hours of Sandland.

3912
02:50:26,890 --> 02:50:27,970
Alright, is it down there?

3913
02:50:29,350 --> 02:50:30,930
Is it all the way down there?

3914
02:50:30,930 --> 02:50:32,630
Alright, we're just going to jump down.

3915
02:50:34,150 --> 02:50:35,530
Oh my god, it is.

3916
02:50:36,550 --> 02:50:37,830
Alright, I can do this.

3917
02:50:40,490 --> 02:50:41,610
Okay, never...

3918
02:50:43,970 --> 02:50:47,650
Let me do the proper way I guess.

3919
02:50:48,890 --> 02:50:52,270
I guess the game did not want me to jump down.

3920
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:54,510
How the fuck do I get there?

3921
02:50:58,580 --> 02:50:59,140
Okay.

3922
02:51:01,380 --> 02:51:03,060
I'm trying to figure out how to get there.

3923
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:07,860
I guess from here to a flip.

3924
02:51:14,580 --> 02:51:16,720
How the fuck do I get down?

3925
02:51:19,100 --> 02:51:19,920
What the hell?

3926
02:51:21,900 --> 02:51:23,020
Get down from here?

3927
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:25,820
I wish I was any good at sensing things like that too.

3928
02:51:27,100 --> 02:51:28,280
Not that bad.

3929
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:29,260
Okay.

3930
02:51:32,540 --> 02:51:33,160
Alright.

3931
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:35,220
Apparently not.

3932
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:38,840
Apparently gravity is saying no today.

3933
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:41,100
What about from here?

3934
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:44,900
Okay.

3935
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:48,480
I'm just trying to test the limits.

3936
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:50,080
Guys.

3937
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:52,200
I just want to know what...

3938
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:53,920
Which one would...

3939
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:57,520
Gravity has to have a stopping point at some...

3940
02:51:57,520 --> 02:51:58,120
That's...

3941
02:51:58,120 --> 02:51:59,080
Somewhere.

3942
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:02,060
Toki, please.

3943
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:04,340
Oh no!

3944
02:52:04,460 --> 02:52:06,980
I just thought gravity was going to stop working.

3945
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:12,180
They force you to listen to the dialogue.

3946
02:52:12,340 --> 02:52:13,360
This is so...

3947
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:15,420
...developed military technology.

3948
02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:22,160
One upside of the Royal Army's iron fist is that it didn't need to fight many actual wars.

3949
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:28,520
Only a small fraction of the Royal Army was dedicated to making technological advancements.

3950
02:52:28,660 --> 02:52:30,040
Oh, so that's why.

3951
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:30,940
Wait.

3952
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:33,580
So, Forrest Land was always at war with others?

3953
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:38,580
And then Sand Land just existed?

3954
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:40,900
It was only at war with itself.

3955
02:52:42,740 --> 02:52:46,500
It's kind of ironic that it takes war to push forward technology.

3956
02:52:47,540 --> 02:52:48,080
Ow.

3957
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,180
That makes sense.

3958
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:51,000
Oh, hey!

3959
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,360
There's a stop here.

3960
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:55,380
Alright, let's see.

3961
02:52:56,140 --> 02:52:58,140
What the fuck are these lizards doing here?

3962
02:52:58,300 --> 02:52:58,960
There's so many.

3963
02:52:59,160 --> 02:53:00,560
Oh my god!

3964
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:01,100
Okay.

3965
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:02,320
Give me a sec.

3966
02:53:02,500 --> 02:53:03,040
Let me loot.

3967
02:53:04,460 --> 02:53:05,500
Give me a sec.

3968
02:53:05,940 --> 02:53:06,980
Oh god!

3969
02:53:07,460 --> 02:53:08,360
Oh god.

3970
02:53:08,500 --> 02:53:08,860
Okay.

3971
02:53:09,240 --> 02:53:10,700
It followed me home.

3972
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:11,700
Here we go.

3973
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:14,680
That's right.

3974
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:16,440
You made a big mistake.

3975
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,760
You made a big fucking mistake.

3976
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:21,300
That's fucking right.

3977
02:53:23,080 --> 02:53:23,760
That's right.

3978
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,740
You're sure not to go in so deep that you can't touch the bottom, Prince.

3979
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:29,320
So, thank you for the super chat.

3980
02:53:29,400 --> 02:53:29,640
Thank you.

3981
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:30,080
Thank you.

3982
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:30,800
More Doki House.

3983
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:31,500
Sand Land!

3984
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:32,740
We're almost...

3985
02:53:32,740 --> 02:53:35,200
I don't know if we're close to done, but I think we're almost done.

3986
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:38,540
I think we're at the final arc now.

3987
02:53:41,320 --> 02:53:42,360
Not long now.

3988
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:46,300
Supreme Commander.

3989
02:53:49,020 --> 02:53:49,540
Rosetta?

3990
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:53,360
I thought I owed you to see to our defense.

3991
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:53,640
Yeah.

3992
02:53:53,640 --> 02:53:54,220
What are you doing here?

3993
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:55,780
Forgive me.

3994
02:53:55,780 --> 02:53:57,240
You don't deserve to be on flat land.

3995
02:53:57,540 --> 02:53:59,540
There is something I would like to confirm with you.

3996
02:54:00,980 --> 02:54:01,500
Yes?

3997
02:54:03,140 --> 02:54:08,300
You once said if we were able to reactivate Garum, it wouldn't be used against the Resistance.

3998
02:54:09,660 --> 02:54:11,640
Please tell me that is still true.

3999
02:54:12,240 --> 02:54:15,240
King Jam and Princess Anne are among them after all.

4000
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:16,280
Oh, I see.

4001
02:54:16,280 --> 02:54:17,440
Oh, she's going to turn to our side.

4002
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:24,940
Garum shall not be fired within our borders.

4003
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:32,700
However, if they flee to Sand Land and continue to oppose us, that's...

4004
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:33,780
Hey, that's not part of the deal.

4005
02:54:34,940 --> 02:54:36,560
She's like her childhood friend.

4006
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:40,700
You're telling me you still haven't found the Resistance?

4007
02:54:45,470 --> 02:54:48,190
Flush them out and burn them to ashes!

4008
02:54:48,190 --> 02:54:48,750
What do you mean?

4009
02:54:48,930 --> 02:54:49,750
Like he was there.

4010
02:54:51,530 --> 02:54:52,750
What is he?

4011
02:54:52,850 --> 02:54:55,070
You know where the resistance... he literally lived there.

4012
02:54:56,930 --> 02:54:59,550
Also, where did all these other people came from?

4013
02:55:21,490 --> 02:55:22,810
He has more medals!

4014
02:55:25,490 --> 02:55:28,810
Where are your medals, Rosetta?

4015
02:55:33,810 --> 02:55:35,410
Oh my gosh!

4016
02:55:36,250 --> 02:55:37,870
He insulted our queen!

4017
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:44,180
Oh my god, that's so fucked up!

4018
02:55:46,060 --> 02:55:49,160
Oh, this is some Scar shit right here.

4019
02:55:49,300 --> 02:55:50,020
I'm just gonna...

4020
02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:52,920
Eliminate them!

4021
02:55:57,620 --> 02:55:59,600
Not as fast though.

4022
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:03,400
The nerve of him.

4023
02:56:03,500 --> 02:56:04,320
I know, right?

4024
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:05,620
So fucked up.

4025
02:56:07,320 --> 02:56:07,920
Wow.

4026
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:09,940
What an army.

4027
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:14,140
What could I possibly do?

4028
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:15,560
What are they gonna do?

4029
02:56:15,620 --> 02:56:16,800
Slide up to me?

4030
02:56:18,640 --> 02:56:19,240
Okay.

4031
02:56:19,240 --> 02:56:19,840
Goodbye.

4032
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:22,280
What?

4033
02:56:22,380 --> 02:56:23,760
What is that?

4034
02:56:26,660 --> 02:56:27,700
What defense?

4035
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:30,240
The world's in serious trouble.

4036
02:56:30,620 --> 02:56:32,540
If something like that takes off...

4037
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:32,580
Weeoo!

4038
02:56:32,580 --> 02:56:32,780
Weeoo!

4039
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:36,580
Nothing's gonna stop us now!

4040
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:40,360
What defense they have!

4041
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:42,080
Weeoo!

4042
02:56:42,280 --> 02:56:43,100
Oh shit!

4043
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:43,920
Okay, it's okay.

4044
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:44,500
I made it through.

4045
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:45,220
It's okay.

4046
02:56:45,300 --> 02:56:46,080
My bike is okay.

4047
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:47,140
Don't worry.

4048
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:51,140
Oh my god.

4049
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:54,560
We're here.

4050
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:56,480
How did they do it?

4051
02:56:56,980 --> 02:56:57,420
Weeo!

4052
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:00,940
How did she do it?

4053
02:57:00,980 --> 02:57:01,160
How did she do it?

4054
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:01,640
Oh shit.

4055
02:57:01,680 --> 02:57:02,860
We have to claim that...

4056
02:57:02,860 --> 02:57:04,540
Okay, we got to claim that real fast.

4057
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:05,400
All right.

4058
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:06,500
This is a little awkward.

4059
02:57:06,720 --> 02:57:07,400
Give me a sec.

4060
02:57:08,340 --> 02:57:10,340
Guys, we need to claim the little...

4061
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:13,880
We need to claim... Okay, don't worry, that's not gonna hurt us.

4062
02:57:14,380 --> 02:57:14,820
Weeoo!

4063
02:57:14,820 --> 02:57:15,940
Oh shit!

4064
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:16,900
My bike!

4065
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:18,680
No!

4066
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:20,220
I got greedy!

4067
02:57:20,540 --> 02:57:23,980
I wanted to claim the... the... No!

4068
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:25,200
Do I have to do that again?

4069
02:57:25,580 --> 02:57:28,340
Oh my god, I have to do that again!

4070
02:57:28,480 --> 02:57:29,780
I got greedy!

4071
02:57:30,440 --> 02:57:31,080
No!

4072
02:57:32,700 --> 02:57:35,540
It's okay, I can dodge all of this again.

4073
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:38,540
Oh no, not again!

4074
02:57:40,780 --> 02:57:42,660
I got so greedy!

4075
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:45,080
I wanted to get the checkpoint!

4076
02:57:45,240 --> 02:57:46,060
The water!

4077
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:48,960
I wanted to get the water!

4078
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:54,160
It's okay, like they're not really a threat.

4079
02:57:54,340 --> 02:57:57,020
I literally just... I don't understand, like...

4080
02:57:57,280 --> 02:57:58,940
Am I supposed to stop them?

4081
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:03,340
Am I supposed to beat those mechs up?

4082
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:04,200
Like...

4083
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:07,980
I don't know.

4084
02:58:08,060 --> 02:58:08,520
Why did I do that?

4085
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:08,860
Why did I do that?

4086
02:58:08,980 --> 02:58:10,400
Why can't I just ride past it?

4087
02:58:10,480 --> 02:58:11,760
Okay, I wanted to claim this.

4088
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:12,620
Yay!

4089
02:58:12,940 --> 02:58:13,800
I got the camp!

4090
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:15,260
Give me a sec, guys!

4091
02:58:15,880 --> 02:58:17,120
Did I claim the camp?

4092
02:58:17,260 --> 02:58:17,840
I did it!

4093
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:20,840
Woo!

4094
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:21,560
It's okay.

4095
02:58:22,480 --> 02:58:23,520
Oh god!

4096
02:58:23,660 --> 02:58:24,760
That's not okay!

4097
02:58:25,860 --> 02:58:26,620
It's alright.

4098
02:58:27,560 --> 02:58:29,100
Riding past it again.

4099
02:58:30,260 --> 02:58:30,780
Oh!

4100
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:33,440
Guys, I got it!

4101
02:58:35,560 --> 02:58:37,040
I got the water!

4102
02:58:38,540 --> 02:58:39,760
We did it, guys!

4103
02:58:42,820 --> 02:58:43,780
Him again?

4104
02:58:48,320 --> 02:58:49,200
Don't worry.

4105
02:58:49,460 --> 02:58:52,960
I got a strong... Oh my god!

4106
02:58:53,100 --> 02:58:53,900
Wait a minute!

4107
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:57,060
Wait, what?

4108
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:00,200
Why is it so strong?

4109
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:05,440
Where is he?

4110
02:59:06,040 --> 02:59:06,800
Where did he go?

4111
02:59:06,880 --> 02:59:07,700
Oh, there he is!

4112
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:10,880
Holy shit!

4113
02:59:10,920 --> 02:59:12,660
He has so much HP now!

4114
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:15,140
Oh my god!

4115
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:17,300
Yeah, he has lasers too!

4116
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:20,060
He's 3.0!

4117
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:23,200
He's at his 3.0 debut!

4118
02:59:25,300 --> 02:59:26,060
Oh god!

4119
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:29,040
Oh, he is strong.

4120
02:59:29,160 --> 02:59:30,620
I'm gonna use the explosive lasers.

4121
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:31,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4122
02:59:32,620 --> 02:59:34,740
I'm gonna make sure I line it up though, properly.

4123
02:59:34,980 --> 02:59:35,420
Wait, where did he go?

4124
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:38,220
Where the fuck did he go?

4125
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:40,140
Oh, there he is!

4126
02:59:40,260 --> 02:59:40,420
Okay.

4127
02:59:41,560 --> 02:59:42,440
Okay.

4128
02:59:42,680 --> 02:59:43,460
No!

4129
02:59:43,900 --> 02:59:47,400
Are you fucking... He dodged my explosive lasers!

4130
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:51,840
That's actually bullshit!

4131
02:59:52,620 --> 02:59:56,240
He actually dodged the explosive lasers!

4132
02:59:58,140 --> 03:00:00,060
I can't believe it.

4133
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:03,840
I... Are you serious?

4134
03:00:03,840 --> 03:00:04,440
Are you serious?

4135
03:00:06,500 --> 03:00:07,300
Oh...

4136
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:12,120
I can't believe he dodged it.

4137
03:00:12,220 --> 03:00:13,100
He's so good!

4138
03:00:13,980 --> 03:00:16,280
He walked to the left!

4139
03:00:16,700 --> 03:00:22,180
I can't believe it!

4140
03:00:22,420 --> 03:00:25,300
He walked to the left!

4141
03:00:28,600 --> 03:00:30,740
And does he do that?

4142
03:00:31,960 --> 03:00:33,680
That should be illegal!

4143
03:00:40,700 --> 03:00:41,860
Oh my god!

4144
03:00:41,900 --> 03:00:42,060
Oh my god!

4145
03:00:42,060 --> 03:00:45,960
I still can't believe he walked to the left and like, fucked me over.

4146
03:00:48,640 --> 03:00:49,440
That's fine.

4147
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:51,080
I literally can just stay here.

4148
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:53,100
He sidesteps!

4149
03:00:54,240 --> 03:00:55,960
That should be illegal!

4150
03:00:58,740 --> 03:00:59,500
There we go.

4151
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:02,660
Alright.

4152
03:01:03,220 --> 03:01:03,780
Oh!

4153
03:01:04,020 --> 03:01:05,380
I truly did it!

4154
03:01:05,380 --> 03:01:07,060
I should've aimbot you, right?

4155
03:01:08,800 --> 03:01:11,160
I should've used my aimbot!

4156
03:01:12,920 --> 03:01:13,740
There we go.

4157
03:01:15,460 --> 03:01:16,020
Oh!

4158
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:17,240
Oh!

4159
03:01:17,500 --> 03:01:18,480
We have it again!

4160
03:01:18,860 --> 03:01:19,380
Oh!

4161
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:20,020
Wait!

4162
03:01:20,100 --> 03:01:20,860
I shouldn't...

4163
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:21,520
Oh god.

4164
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:21,820
Okay.

4165
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:23,380
Okay, watch this.

4166
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:26,180
Can't dodge this now.

4167
03:01:27,600 --> 03:01:28,160
BOOM!

4168
03:01:29,460 --> 03:01:32,480
I take like a hundred damage but can't dodge this!

4169
03:01:32,620 --> 03:01:32,840
You fool!

4170
03:01:34,140 --> 03:01:38,820
I'll let daddy's girl Rosetta finish you while I watch from a safe distance!

4171
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:41,600
Wait, what?

4172
03:01:41,860 --> 03:01:43,160
I'm gonna fight Rosetta now?

4173
03:01:50,300 --> 03:01:50,840
Alright.

4174
03:01:52,700 --> 03:01:53,940
Where am I supposed to go?

4175
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:57,260
How the fuck do I get there?

4176
03:01:57,540 --> 03:01:58,560
Did I came from here?

4177
03:01:59,020 --> 03:02:01,700
Where did I come from?

4178
03:02:01,820 --> 03:02:02,740
Where do I go?

4179
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:06,480
Where do I come from?

4180
03:02:06,540 --> 03:02:07,500
Where do I go?

4181
03:02:07,500 --> 03:02:08,320
Oh, this way.

4182
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:11,780
Alright.

4183
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:15,960
Yeah.

4184
03:02:19,620 --> 03:02:21,140
What was going on with him?

4185
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:24,280
I'm just gonna shoot him from the distance.

4186
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,780
I am... there's no need for me to be there.

4187
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:28,600
See?

4188
03:02:28,940 --> 03:02:29,960
Alright, get over here.

4189
03:02:30,700 --> 03:02:31,560
Oh my god!

4190
03:02:31,640 --> 03:02:32,500
How are you still alive?

4191
03:02:34,700 --> 03:02:35,480
Alright, you guys.

4192
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:36,860
You guys are gonna get there soon!

4193
03:02:37,500 --> 03:02:37,840
I believe!

4194
03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:41,260
Don't worry, you're gonna get there soon!

4195
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:42,600
There we go.

4196
03:02:43,320 --> 03:02:43,880
Nice.

4197
03:02:46,720 --> 03:02:47,280
Alright.

4198
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:49,480
Wait, what?

4199
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:50,060
Tough?

4200
03:02:50,980 --> 03:02:53,280
Okay, okay, Beezo, but we...

4201
03:02:54,380 --> 03:02:57,160
We've been... this has been a breeze so far.

4202
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:01,260
Okay, don't worry.

4203
03:03:04,780 --> 03:03:06,040
Is he dead?

4204
03:03:06,260 --> 03:03:06,820
Nice.

4205
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:08,020
I'm gonna go get him.

4206
03:03:08,020 --> 03:03:08,800
And then we'll get rid of him.

4207
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:11,400
And then we'll get rid of him.

4208
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:14,660
This might be a little overkill, but that's okay.

4209
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:20,580
Shooting the cannon might be just a little overkill.

4210
03:03:21,300 --> 03:03:22,360
Just a little bit.

4211
03:03:23,080 --> 03:03:23,940
What's over here?

4212
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:26,720
I feel like I should go here though.

4213
03:03:27,960 --> 03:03:28,400
Okay.

4214
03:03:28,580 --> 03:03:30,580
It's nice that I can use this from afar.

4215
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:32,400
Alright, now they're getting closer.

4216
03:03:32,640 --> 03:03:34,780
But like, it's so nice that I can use this from afar.

4217
03:03:35,140 --> 03:03:36,360
Like, it still works.

4218
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:37,480
It still works.

4219
03:03:37,480 --> 03:03:38,720
And then...

4220
03:03:38,720 --> 03:03:39,320
Boom.

4221
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:41,000
Okay, now reload.

4222
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:43,780
And...

4223
03:03:43,780 --> 03:03:46,800
Oh, okay, he's dead.

4224
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:48,780
Alright.

4225
03:03:50,210 --> 03:03:50,980
Now where do I go?

4226
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:52,920
Sound there.

4227
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:54,100
Wait, I could've just drove down.

4228
03:03:54,380 --> 03:03:55,660
I did not have to...

4229
03:03:57,260 --> 03:04:00,900
Guys, I made a mistake.

4230
03:04:02,740 --> 03:04:05,380
Do not just drive down, guys!

4231
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:07,460
Do not just drive down!

4232
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:13,700
Guys, don't just drive down!

4233
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:15,180
We've learned!

4234
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,040
We can learn from mistakes!

4235
03:04:18,820 --> 03:04:19,780
We can...

4236
03:04:20,460 --> 03:04:21,160
Alright.

4237
03:04:21,700 --> 03:04:25,600
Alright, gravity has sort of forsaken me.

4238
03:04:28,420 --> 03:04:29,640
What the fuck?

4239
03:04:29,820 --> 03:04:31,400
We're gonna do a little pistol gun.

4240
03:04:32,540 --> 03:04:34,120
When you heal again.

4241
03:04:36,180 --> 03:04:36,920
Alright.

4242
03:04:37,880 --> 03:04:40,780
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but like...

4243
03:04:40,780 --> 03:04:44,980
In this world, there's something that we like to call gravity.

4244
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:49,160
And sometimes, it is a good idea not to...

4245
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:52,080
Not to let gravity win!

4246
03:04:54,340 --> 03:04:55,120
Alright, nice.

4247
03:04:56,380 --> 03:04:56,900
And...

4248
03:04:56,900 --> 03:04:59,420
I'm just gonna get rid of these smaller guys too.

4249
03:05:00,600 --> 03:05:01,760
Wait, is he dying?

4250
03:05:03,060 --> 03:05:04,800
Wait, but they told me I don't kill!

4251
03:05:05,800 --> 03:05:06,740
That guy...

4252
03:05:06,740 --> 03:05:08,280
He said fading away!

4253
03:05:08,420 --> 03:05:09,540
His life is fading away!

4254
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:12,400
Did I just kill a man?

4255
03:05:12,740 --> 03:05:13,440
No, I...

4256
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:14,500
No, it's not me.

4257
03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:14,980
It's my tank.

4258
03:05:15,060 --> 03:05:15,400
It's my tank.

4259
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:16,980
It's my tank.

4260
03:05:17,460 --> 03:05:18,500
Alright, get...

4261
03:05:18,500 --> 03:05:19,340
On this side.

4262
03:05:20,300 --> 03:05:20,820
Okay.

4263
03:05:21,420 --> 03:05:21,940
Okay.

4264
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:23,800
Pew!

4265
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:25,360
Pew!

4266
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:28,420
Pew!

4267
03:05:28,420 --> 03:05:28,580
Pew!

4268
03:05:30,700 --> 03:05:31,100
Pew!

4269
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:32,560
Oh, wait, I didn't get rid of the tank yet!

4270
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:35,320
Okay, now I got rid of the tank.

4271
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:38,700
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

4272
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:40,920
Alright.

4273
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:42,240
Easy.

4274
03:05:42,360 --> 03:05:43,000
There's more?

4275
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:46,480
Holy shit!

4276
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:48,540
How much money do they have?

4277
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:53,720
Why couldn't I use this to invade Sand Land?

4278
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:57,840
Alright, nice.

4279
03:05:58,540 --> 03:06:02,420
Feels like they could have done so much by using all this to invade Sand Land.

4280
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:06,160
Alright, we're almost there.

4281
03:06:08,900 --> 03:06:10,360
Why is this so slow?

4282
03:06:11,600 --> 03:06:13,040
Am I not using my...

4283
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:14,140
I have so many questions.

4284
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:15,600
Rosetta?

4285
03:06:18,360 --> 03:06:20,820
Because that is not worth that much.

4286
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:24,160
Hey, Rosetta.

4287
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:30,860
I'm eating my sandwich while you guys talk it out, ladies.

4288
03:06:38,560 --> 03:06:39,440
Oh, yeah?

4289
03:06:40,340 --> 03:06:41,440
I have a tank.

4290
03:06:42,160 --> 03:06:44,800
I mean, you have a bigger tank, but I have a tank.

4291
03:06:45,100 --> 03:06:45,480
Two.

4292
03:06:48,600 --> 03:06:49,040
Ooh.

4293
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:51,120
That's a lot of sauce on my sandwich.

4294
03:07:01,220 --> 03:07:07,640
The end that I know is stubborn, a sore loser, and a crybaby.

4295
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:08,000
Whoa!

4296
03:07:08,300 --> 03:07:08,600
Whoa!

4297
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:12,720
You never would go easy on me back when we'd play games together.

4298
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:14,800
Am I a crybaby?

4299
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:17,300
Oh, I would.

4300
03:07:17,480 --> 03:07:18,080
I'm not.

4301
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:20,480
You were just so weak that you still lost.

4302
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:25,180
Well, not anymore.

4303
03:07:30,130 --> 03:07:31,190
We'll find out.

4304
03:07:32,070 --> 03:07:32,670
I'm not.

4305
03:07:34,470 --> 03:07:35,130
Oh, shit.

4306
03:07:35,950 --> 03:07:36,590
Oh, shit.

4307
03:07:39,410 --> 03:07:42,450
Hope you're not expecting me to start going easy on you now.

4308
03:07:42,550 --> 03:07:43,210
Wait, we're starting?

4309
03:07:43,650 --> 03:07:44,310
Oh, shit.

4310
03:07:44,410 --> 03:07:44,650
Okay.

4311
03:07:47,970 --> 03:07:49,650
I thought that that two would be longer!

4312
03:07:50,250 --> 03:07:51,510
I thought that that...

4313
03:07:54,620 --> 03:07:55,400
I'm in the tank.

4314
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:56,020
I'm in the tank.

4315
03:07:56,120 --> 03:07:56,480
I'm in the...

4316
03:07:56,480 --> 03:07:59,100
But you haven't won a game.

4317
03:08:00,180 --> 03:08:00,580
Okay.

4318
03:08:01,020 --> 03:08:01,620
All right.

4319
03:08:02,120 --> 03:08:03,320
I'm in the tank now.

4320
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:06,760
Now I'm in the tank now.

4321
03:08:13,980 --> 03:08:16,140
Okay, that was scary.

4322
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:17,940
But I'm in the tank now.

4323
03:08:18,020 --> 03:08:18,940
I'm in the tank.

4324
03:08:19,060 --> 03:08:20,620
Don't get run over.

4325
03:08:25,240 --> 03:08:27,680
I wasn't... I didn't know she was gonna start.

4326
03:08:27,780 --> 03:08:30,140
I thought I had the longest time in the cutscene.

4327
03:08:30,140 --> 03:08:33,740
How the fuck... How was I supposed to know?

4328
03:08:37,660 --> 03:08:39,760
She almost road killed me.

4329
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:40,560
No, she didn't.

4330
03:08:41,280 --> 03:08:42,800
She almost did.

4331
03:08:43,480 --> 03:08:44,720
Holy shit.

4332
03:08:45,680 --> 03:08:47,760
She did not let me chill.

4333
03:08:48,200 --> 03:08:49,660
She was just like...

4334
03:08:49,660 --> 03:08:52,340
She did not just ready, set, go.

4335
03:08:52,520 --> 03:08:53,280
She just went go.

4336
03:08:53,640 --> 03:08:55,600
You know how they're like, we're gonna start at three?

4337
03:08:55,780 --> 03:08:57,220
It's like they start at one.

4338
03:09:00,140 --> 03:09:00,780
Oh god.

4339
03:09:00,980 --> 03:09:02,860
Oh god.

4340
03:09:03,180 --> 03:09:05,340
That was a lot of damage.

4341
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:10,620
That was... Okay, let's just heal a little bit.

4342
03:09:13,180 --> 03:09:13,680
Okay.

4343
03:09:16,040 --> 03:09:18,620
I almost got a taste of my own medicine, yeah.

4344
03:09:21,280 --> 03:09:21,780
Okay.

4345
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:24,300
Ral, get back in here, Ral.

4346
03:09:24,740 --> 03:09:26,100
Ral, get back in here!

4347
03:09:28,580 --> 03:09:29,080
Okay.

4348
03:09:31,420 --> 03:09:31,820
Laser!

4349
03:09:35,840 --> 03:09:36,240
Alright.

4350
03:09:36,360 --> 03:09:37,160
Oh, it's almost down.

4351
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:37,800
It's almost down.

4352
03:09:38,900 --> 03:09:39,300
Phew!

4353
03:09:42,080 --> 03:09:42,480
Phew!

4354
03:09:43,900 --> 03:09:45,060
It's almost one more hit.

4355
03:09:45,100 --> 03:09:45,660
One more hit!

4356
03:09:46,160 --> 03:09:46,560
Phew!

4357
03:09:46,760 --> 03:09:48,220
Okay, two more hits maybe!

4358
03:09:49,740 --> 03:09:50,800
Okay, maybe three!

4359
03:09:53,300 --> 03:09:54,480
Oh my god.

4360
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:55,980
We're almost there!

4361
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,020
Oh, it's looking at me.

4362
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:00,080
I don't like it when it looks at me.

4363
03:10:00,080 --> 03:10:02,400
Oh, I got the boost!

4364
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:04,140
The nitro!

4365
03:10:04,180 --> 03:10:04,740
The nitro!

4366
03:10:05,940 --> 03:10:06,540
Nice.

4367
03:10:10,700 --> 03:10:11,300
Finally.

4368
03:10:15,280 --> 03:10:16,400
Stand down!

4369
03:10:19,160 --> 03:10:20,700
Afraid I can't do that.

4370
03:10:21,220 --> 03:10:26,040
If you want to get past, it will have to be over my dead body.

4371
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:27,780
No, Rosetta!

4372
03:10:27,980 --> 03:10:29,260
It doesn't have to be this way!

4373
03:10:34,650 --> 03:10:35,290
Hey!

4374
03:10:35,290 --> 03:10:35,670
B house!

4375
03:10:35,950 --> 03:10:36,610
What are you doing?

4376
03:10:37,930 --> 03:10:41,130
I'm grateful for your long lifespan, Fiend.

4377
03:10:41,450 --> 03:10:44,810
It will give me the chance to kill you in my next life.

4378
03:10:45,130 --> 03:10:46,250
Am I gonna slap her?

4379
03:10:49,090 --> 03:10:50,370
Oh, shit!

4380
03:10:51,730 --> 03:10:52,370
Come on!

4381
03:10:52,490 --> 03:10:53,250
Let's go!

4382
03:11:02,970 --> 03:11:05,130
Is her skull okay?

4383
03:11:06,130 --> 03:11:06,770
She's dead.

4384
03:11:07,590 --> 03:11:08,230
Bro,

4385
03:11:12,280 --> 03:11:12,640
I...

4386
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:14,200
Guys, I...

4387
03:11:17,220 --> 03:11:17,960
Brain

4388
03:11:22,500 --> 03:11:23,200
damage!

4389
03:11:23,720 --> 03:11:24,960
That is... Okay.

4390
03:11:25,500 --> 03:11:26,240
Okay.

4391
03:11:26,880 --> 03:11:31,680
I like how... Alright, we're gonna not pay attention to that, I guess.

4392
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:36,980
Oh my god.

4393
03:11:37,080 --> 03:11:40,020
That would have fucking... That is worse than a concussion!

4394
03:11:42,700 --> 03:11:45,620
It should be... Oh my god.

4395
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:47,600
Oh my god.

4396
03:11:47,600 --> 03:11:49,760
We're actually thinking of the super chat.

4397
03:11:49,820 --> 03:11:50,160
Thank you.

4398
03:11:50,300 --> 03:11:50,580
Thank you.

4399
03:11:50,580 --> 03:11:53,000
The deadly forehead finger flip.

4400
03:11:53,220 --> 03:11:54,960
Oh my god.

4401
03:11:55,780 --> 03:11:57,840
Oh my god.

4402
03:11:58,620 --> 03:12:01,620
What the fuck did I just witness?

4403
03:12:02,600 --> 03:12:07,280
That like... That is like... That... Oh, she gets into a coma.

4404
03:12:07,380 --> 03:12:08,180
That's lucky.

4405
03:12:08,540 --> 03:12:10,620
And she's not a vegetable by then.

4406
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:13,000
Mm.

4407
03:12:14,020 --> 03:12:14,300
Mm.

4408
03:12:14,540 --> 03:12:14,740
Mm.

4409
03:12:15,100 --> 03:12:15,800
Mm.

4410
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:21,020
I thought she was gonna slap her.

4411
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:24,200
A slap would have... Like, at least she'd survive.

4412
03:12:26,240 --> 03:12:27,360
How are you alive?

4413
03:12:27,740 --> 03:12:29,060
How do you not have brain damage?

4414
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:29,720
What a pity.

4415
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:32,520
Abby...

4416
03:12:33,220 --> 03:12:34,980
What are you doing here?

4417
03:12:36,140 --> 03:12:37,620
No, never mind.

4418
03:12:38,120 --> 03:12:39,400
That doesn't matter.

4419
03:12:41,180 --> 03:12:42,360
After them...

4420
03:12:43,100 --> 03:12:44,600
You have to...

4421
03:12:47,260 --> 03:12:47,860
What?

4422
03:12:47,860 --> 03:12:48,760
Such agitation.

4423
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:50,260
I'll help you relax.

4424
03:12:50,580 --> 03:12:52,080
For a very long time!

4425
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:52,460
What?

4426
03:12:55,440 --> 03:12:57,340
This is no time for games!

4427
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:02,480
Abby...

4428
03:13:04,040 --> 03:13:04,640
You...

4429
03:13:06,660 --> 03:13:09,440
I'll give you a glorious death in battle.

4430
03:13:09,560 --> 03:13:11,340
To expunge the dishonor...

4431
03:13:11,340 --> 03:13:11,500
What?

4432
03:13:11,700 --> 03:13:12,160
... Of your defeat!

4433
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:15,220
Did she die?!

4434
03:13:15,220 --> 03:13:15,220
Really?

4435
03:13:15,980 --> 03:13:18,560
She died from a bullet and not the head flick?

4436
03:13:27,900 --> 03:13:30,340
Her weakness was guns.

4437
03:13:32,920 --> 03:13:37,360
She died from a bullet but not the fucking flick to the head.

4438
03:13:37,620 --> 03:13:37,960
Okay.

4439
03:13:41,760 --> 03:13:42,280
Okay.

4440
03:13:42,280 --> 03:13:43,620
Oh shit!

4441
03:13:43,800 --> 03:13:45,940
Okay, I'm just gonna grab this guy.

4442
03:13:48,420 --> 03:13:49,380
Where are you?

4443
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:51,420
I think I punched him.

4444
03:13:53,620 --> 03:13:56,200
I can't see but I assume I punched him.

4445
03:13:57,960 --> 03:13:59,820
But that's my one weakness.

4446
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:00,120
No!

4447
03:14:01,220 --> 03:14:02,500
I can't fit!

4448
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:03,960
Let's fuck this.

4449
03:14:04,100 --> 03:14:05,360
I'm just gonna ride my way through.

4450
03:14:05,640 --> 03:14:06,900
Oh my god!

4451
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:07,940
Okay, we gotta repeat.

4452
03:14:07,960 --> 03:14:08,940
Prepare this bike at least.

4453
03:14:14,880 --> 03:14:18,820
Still better wake up than be your clock tucked in the Zoom chat.

4454
03:14:18,900 --> 03:14:19,580
Thank you.

4455
03:14:24,820 --> 03:14:27,840
What the fuck?

4456
03:14:44,510 --> 03:14:45,770
Let's get on the bike.

4457
03:14:46,010 --> 03:14:47,190
The bike is the fastest.

4458
03:14:49,170 --> 03:14:49,930
What?

4459
03:14:50,090 --> 03:14:51,230
Oh, it activated!

4460
03:15:00,320 --> 03:15:01,080
Amazing!

4461
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:02,340
This is amazing!

4462
03:15:06,880 --> 03:15:08,340
Indeed it is!

4463
03:15:09,720 --> 03:15:14,020
With this, our army will control the entire world!

4464
03:15:15,900 --> 03:15:20,240
And yours truly has risen to the post of second in command!

4465
03:15:22,200 --> 03:15:25,640
Now no one in the world can defy me!

4466
03:15:28,300 --> 03:15:30,320
He's like so insignificant.

4467
03:15:30,780 --> 03:15:32,960
Like, this story!

4468
03:15:35,960 --> 03:15:38,640
We were too late.

4469
03:15:39,500 --> 03:15:42,460
Can someone just get him a new TV?

4470
03:15:43,220 --> 03:15:43,680
We'll have to.

4471
03:15:43,680 --> 03:15:44,340
Run away!

4472
03:15:53,850 --> 03:15:55,890
I can't stand it.

4473
03:15:56,030 --> 03:15:57,930
How dare those worms put us in this mess?

4474
03:15:57,930 --> 03:15:58,690
This is such a fight.

4475
03:15:59,930 --> 03:16:01,350
That does it.

4476
03:16:05,540 --> 03:16:06,180
Soldiers!

4477
03:16:06,320 --> 03:16:07,540
Ready the main cannon!

4478
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:09,820
Target our lower ports!

4479
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:12,780
The main cannon?

4480
03:16:12,940 --> 03:16:14,600
That hasn't been tested yet!

4481
03:16:14,800 --> 03:16:16,680
How do they know how to run this?

4482
03:16:17,560 --> 03:16:20,520
Other than this soldier, this is their first time here!

4483
03:16:22,620 --> 03:16:26,740
They're not even educated to fucking run the Death Star!

4484
03:16:27,520 --> 03:16:28,720
Yes, sir!

4485
03:16:31,440 --> 03:16:33,120
Preparing to fire main cannon!

4486
03:16:33,380 --> 03:16:34,060
How are you?

4487
03:16:34,060 --> 03:16:35,760
Literally first day on the job.

4488
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:39,620
They're like, we haven't even... we don't even know which buttons those are!

4489
03:16:40,160 --> 03:16:41,420
What are those buttons?

4490
03:16:41,580 --> 03:16:42,000
Main cannon!

4491
03:16:42,900 --> 03:16:44,500
That damn Mumio!

4492
03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:46,040
Has he lost his mind?

4493
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:47,500
What manual?

4494
03:16:47,820 --> 03:16:51,220
This ship has been out of commission for like hundreds of years!

4495
03:16:58,270 --> 03:16:59,890
Energy at maximum!

4496
03:17:00,690 --> 03:17:01,730
Initiating countdown!

4497
03:17:02,250 --> 03:17:03,450
Thirty seconds!

4498
03:17:06,170 --> 03:17:06,830
Rosetta!

4499
03:17:07,250 --> 03:17:08,290
Are you alive?

4500
03:17:09,590 --> 03:17:10,650
You got shot!

4501
03:17:11,010 --> 03:17:12,090
And brain damage!

4502
03:17:13,330 --> 03:17:15,350
He's al- she's alive?!

4503
03:17:15,890 --> 03:17:20,110
Sorry, the flick was like... got her to like one- two HP.

4504
03:17:20,530 --> 03:17:23,010
The gunshot got her to one HP!

4505
03:17:24,750 --> 03:17:26,110
You know like Pokémon?

4506
03:17:26,490 --> 03:17:29,270
They withstand it because of their love for you?

4507
03:17:29,270 --> 03:17:30,190
That's what happened.

4508
03:17:30,490 --> 03:17:31,970
The power of love.

4509
03:17:47,330 --> 03:17:50,150
Jesus, crazy, uh, crazy danger.

4510
03:17:50,850 --> 03:17:50,950
Oh!

4511
03:17:51,990 --> 03:17:52,630
Woah!

4512
03:18:04,920 --> 03:18:06,860
Guys, I think Eppy's dead!

4513
03:18:09,500 --> 03:18:13,700
Bro, what the?

4514
03:18:13,900 --> 03:18:17,560
Oh my god, I think... guys, I think Eppy's dead!

4515
03:18:25,340 --> 03:18:26,020
Dead!

4516
03:18:26,020 --> 03:18:26,640
Oh my god, they're not serious!

4517
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:28,340
Yeah, I don't think they can out run that!

4518
03:18:28,780 --> 03:18:29,460
Oh!

4519
03:18:29,460 --> 03:18:29,640
There he is!

4520
03:18:30,780 --> 03:18:31,460
Daddy!

4521
03:18:32,380 --> 03:18:33,060
Why?

4522
03:18:35,360 --> 03:18:37,340
That's the dad?!

4523
03:18:37,340 --> 03:18:39,600
Has we learned nothing!

4524
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:40,300
Wait!

4525
03:18:40,800 --> 03:18:42,680
Is Eppie her dad?

4526
03:18:46,160 --> 03:18:46,680
Okay!

4527
03:18:46,960 --> 03:18:47,640
Oh, bread!

4528
03:18:48,060 --> 03:18:49,260
Oh, thank god!

4529
03:18:49,560 --> 03:18:52,980
Okay, I was like... Okay, it's... Okay, bread's the dad.

4530
03:18:53,180 --> 03:18:54,120
Okay, that's a lot better.

4531
03:18:54,220 --> 03:18:56,740
I was like, that's so fucked up if Eppie was the father.

4532
03:18:57,220 --> 03:18:58,700
Okay, bread's the dad.

4533
03:18:58,980 --> 03:18:59,300
Alright.

4534
03:19:13,260 --> 03:19:14,800
Oh, thank god.

4535
03:19:20,480 --> 03:19:25,300
I can't believe it!

4536
03:19:25,340 --> 03:19:29,920
All this happened because you got beat up by Lucifer for breaking his TV.

4537
03:19:32,860 --> 03:19:37,080
Clearly, Sandland had no water because he fucking broke into Lucifer's house.

4538
03:19:44,990 --> 03:19:45,590
Princess!

4539
03:19:45,590 --> 03:19:46,590
Thank goodness!

4540
03:19:46,950 --> 03:19:48,550
All four of you made it back safely.

4541
03:19:48,550 --> 03:19:49,710
All for the TV!

4542
03:19:50,790 --> 03:19:54,790
If the cannon was aimed towards us, we wouldn't have made it.

4543
03:19:55,730 --> 03:19:56,670
And the others?

4544
03:20:00,380 --> 03:20:03,440
We lost many of us in that attack.

4545
03:20:06,750 --> 03:20:07,650
Who died?

4546
03:20:09,470 --> 03:20:11,050
Uh... Mr. Rao.

4547
03:20:11,270 --> 03:20:13,190
Who is that in your car?

4548
03:20:15,630 --> 03:20:16,750
General Rosetta.

4549
03:20:19,570 --> 03:20:20,210
What?

4550
03:20:22,370 --> 03:20:23,010
Longo!

4551
03:20:23,390 --> 03:20:24,290
I can explain...

4552
03:20:24,290 --> 03:20:25,390
She's a childhood friend!

4553
03:20:25,550 --> 03:20:26,550
We're gonna be roommates!

4554
03:20:40,800 --> 03:20:42,940
And they were roommates.

4555
03:20:46,220 --> 03:20:47,960
I've done what I can.

4556
03:20:48,780 --> 03:20:49,420
Now...

4557
03:20:49,420 --> 03:20:52,580
The rest... is up to her.

4558
03:20:54,360 --> 03:20:55,420
Look after her.

4559
03:20:56,360 --> 03:20:57,820
Hey, can you check her brain?

4560
03:20:57,940 --> 03:20:59,160
See if there's brain activity?

4561
03:20:59,640 --> 03:21:00,560
I will.

4562
03:21:05,560 --> 03:21:07,260
They didn't even take off her uniform!

4563
03:21:07,500 --> 03:21:09,140
How are we giving her medical assistance?

4564
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:13,080
She's still wearing maybe blood-soaked uniforms in there right now!

4565
03:21:13,800 --> 03:21:15,520
Like she was on the ground!

4566
03:21:15,860 --> 03:21:18,760
Take off the uniform and put her in something else!

4567
03:21:18,960 --> 03:21:20,940
The dirt is gonna get into her wound!

4568
03:21:22,740 --> 03:21:24,660
Is her skull in one piece?

4569
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:25,760
That's a good question!

4570
03:21:25,880 --> 03:21:28,360
Is her skull in one piece after everything I did?

4571
03:21:29,920 --> 03:21:31,400
Save our queen!

4572
03:21:34,260 --> 03:21:34,740
Alright.

4573
03:21:38,120 --> 03:21:39,700
Alright, let's see...

4574
03:21:40,380 --> 03:21:42,120
Oh, yeah, go this way.

4575
03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:46,720
Alright, but... Oh, I was gonna say I need to use the bathroom, but I guess we'll do this cutscene.

4576
03:21:47,900 --> 03:21:48,820
I don't know.

4577
03:21:49,780 --> 03:21:50,480
But yeah...

4578
03:21:50,940 --> 03:21:53,100
Then you can count on her making it.

4579
03:21:53,680 --> 03:21:56,360
She's always been a tough girl after all.

4580
03:21:58,840 --> 03:22:02,920
Perhaps we can get some useful information from her when she wakes.

4581
03:22:04,780 --> 03:22:07,320
Are you going to keep fighting?

4582
03:22:09,120 --> 03:22:10,500
I've been thinking...

4583
03:22:10,500 --> 03:22:12,380
Maybe you could take...

4584
03:22:12,380 --> 03:22:13,600
The king was not fighting!

4585
03:22:14,120 --> 03:22:17,000
Like, he was just here at the base!

4586
03:22:17,160 --> 03:22:19,460
And just break away from anything you've worked for?

4587
03:22:21,240 --> 03:22:24,240
I'm not saying we don't stand a chance...

4588
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:25,480
But...

4589
03:22:26,100 --> 03:22:28,200
We've lost so many allies already.

4590
03:22:28,200 --> 03:22:28,780
Who did we lose?

4591
03:22:29,260 --> 03:22:31,060
Like, soldier number three?

4592
03:22:31,060 --> 03:22:31,840
With no face?

4593
03:22:32,140 --> 03:22:32,260
A name?

4594
03:22:32,260 --> 03:22:35,380
I'm afraid that running away from here is the one thing I cannot do.

4595
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:36,680
Fucking Rosetta lived!

4596
03:22:37,780 --> 03:22:38,680
Why not?

4597
03:22:40,520 --> 03:22:43,140
Oh, yeah, move to Spino so I can tax my people.

4598
03:22:43,340 --> 03:22:46,020
If I abandoned my people and homeland, what kind of king would I be?

4599
03:22:46,760 --> 03:22:49,440
Besides, we still have allies in the world.

4600
03:22:49,460 --> 03:22:51,840
And I've been waiting for them for ten years.

4601
03:22:53,280 --> 03:22:56,720
It's only fair that I wait for a time, too.

4602
03:22:58,760 --> 03:22:59,360
But...

4603
03:22:59,360 --> 03:23:02,340
Bread and his troops already know where you are!

4604
03:23:03,220 --> 03:23:08,040
They could obliterate this entire region if they fire Garim's main cannon at you!

4605
03:23:09,540 --> 03:23:13,860
That only makes it all the more important that I not leave.

4606
03:23:14,280 --> 03:23:19,120
As long as I'm here, Supreme Commander Bread might hesitate to fire on this location.

4607
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:25,960
Even during those long years he kept me imprisoned, he always treated me with total respect.

4608
03:23:26,720 --> 03:23:31,100
Yeah, okay, they're going in assuming that Bread can control the psychotic angel.

4609
03:23:31,680 --> 03:23:32,860
My father!

4610
03:23:33,340 --> 03:23:36,300
And soldier number three did so much for us, Doki!

4611
03:23:36,500 --> 03:23:37,680
How could you say that?

4612
03:23:37,860 --> 03:23:39,120
He was my Oshi!

4613
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:43,700
Every person born on this planet has a duty they must fulfill.

4614
03:23:44,980 --> 03:23:49,280
Mine is to be a stout tree under which all those seeking refuge here can find their way.

4615
03:23:49,280 --> 03:23:50,400
You did nothing for ten years!

4616
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:51,600
Like...

4617
03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:54,560
Now, you must go fulfill your own.

4618
03:23:54,980 --> 03:23:59,180
You can talk about this responsibility when you were stuck in prison for ten years.

4619
03:24:05,260 --> 03:24:07,620
Just listen to your heart, Anne.

4620
03:24:08,140 --> 03:24:11,020
That is where you're sure to find your answer.

4621
03:24:12,420 --> 03:24:13,380
That's my girl.

4622
03:24:13,540 --> 03:24:14,260
Go on.

4623
03:24:18,860 --> 03:24:21,900
King James is a truly wise ruler.

4624
03:24:22,260 --> 03:24:23,400
We're gonna be heroes!

4625
03:24:24,140 --> 03:24:26,560
He's got nothing on the King of Demons.

4626
03:24:26,560 --> 03:24:29,680
Before we go with the final arc, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4627
03:24:29,800 --> 03:24:30,580
How about that, guys?

4628
03:24:31,020 --> 03:24:32,060
We're almost done!

4629
03:24:32,400 --> 03:24:36,040
I know I said that like an hour ago, but this time, we're almost done.

4630
03:27:31,150 --> 03:27:32,370
I am back!

4631
03:27:32,790 --> 03:27:34,130
I'm back, guys.

4632
03:27:34,350 --> 03:27:34,950
Give me a sec.

4633
03:27:35,070 --> 03:27:37,390
Just gonna adjust some stuff real fast.

4634
03:27:38,130 --> 03:27:38,610
Oh!

4635
03:27:39,730 --> 03:27:40,510
The heck?

4636
03:27:40,730 --> 03:27:42,570
Why do I have like so many... Oh, okay.

4637
03:27:42,650 --> 03:27:42,910
Never mind.

4638
03:27:45,250 --> 03:27:48,290
I was like, why do I have so many messages?

4639
03:27:48,290 --> 03:27:49,810
Oh, it's about the...

4640
03:27:49,810 --> 03:27:51,470
Oh, yes!

4641
03:27:51,570 --> 03:27:52,610
It was about the...

4642
03:27:53,470 --> 03:27:54,650
Anime Expo stuff.

4643
03:27:56,550 --> 03:27:58,090
Also, thank you for the super chat!

4644
03:27:58,690 --> 03:28:04,370
Darkstar, Byte, Ginger, Risa, Hiro, Dark, Duck, Hey, Johnny, Maddie, Kaz, and Alan!

4645
03:28:04,510 --> 03:28:05,110
Thank you for the super chat!

4646
03:28:05,210 --> 03:28:05,330
Thank you!

4647
03:28:05,830 --> 03:28:06,770
I guess you didn't know.

4648
03:28:07,510 --> 03:28:13,370
We're gonna have an extra guest for my karaoke at an expo.

4649
03:28:13,370 --> 03:28:14,850
And it's gonna be with Yuusan!

4650
03:28:15,070 --> 03:28:17,370
Yuusan's gonna be a bonus guest at my karaoke.

4651
03:28:19,050 --> 03:28:21,790
And we're gonna have some duets and some solo songs.

4652
03:28:22,030 --> 03:28:22,550
So, yes!

4653
03:28:23,150 --> 03:28:23,950
I'm getting carried.

4654
03:28:24,470 --> 03:28:27,570
I'm gonna be on Yuusan's backpack as they carry me in karaoke.

4655
03:28:31,530 --> 03:28:33,790
But yeah, that was what the message... I was like, what the fuck?

4656
03:28:33,850 --> 03:28:34,470
20 messages?

4657
03:28:34,570 --> 03:28:35,990
Why do I have 20 messages?

4658
03:28:40,890 --> 03:28:41,690
So, yeah.

4659
03:28:41,710 --> 03:28:42,510
I had to double check.

4660
03:28:43,930 --> 03:28:46,350
They were just talking about the announcement for it.

4661
03:28:47,870 --> 03:28:49,670
Alright, and what do you wanna say?

4662
03:29:05,130 --> 03:29:06,170
Oh, yeah, okay.

4663
03:29:06,270 --> 03:29:07,150
I gotta buy stuff?

4664
03:29:07,410 --> 03:29:07,610
Okay.

4665
03:29:08,130 --> 03:29:08,930
I'll buy a shield.

4666
03:29:17,790 --> 03:29:18,770
You're not fighting shit.

4667
03:29:18,870 --> 03:29:20,850
You're just staying in my tank and repairing it.

4668
03:29:24,650 --> 03:29:26,890
And protect everyone who supported him.

4669
03:29:27,990 --> 03:29:34,150
That's why I want to be a beacon of hope for all of those who protected me.

4670
03:29:35,450 --> 03:29:37,570
I take it you found your answer?

4671
03:29:39,210 --> 03:29:39,890
Yeah.

4672
03:29:42,600 --> 03:29:47,660
The two of them are truly the sword and shield of forest land.

4673
03:29:49,100 --> 03:29:50,440
What about... what?

4674
03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:51,400
What about me?

4675
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:54,480
Please... don't...

4676
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:56,360
I did so much!

4677
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:58,340
I'll never know.

4678
03:29:58,580 --> 03:29:59,540
What do you mean?

4679
03:30:00,100 --> 03:30:00,960
What about me?

4680
03:30:01,800 --> 03:30:02,320
In that case, we must return to Sandland.

4681
03:30:02,320 --> 03:30:03,500
It's not always about you.

4682
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:04,940
It's not me, me, me, me, me, okay?

4683
03:30:06,460 --> 03:30:08,400
We have to stop Red at all costs.

4684
03:30:08,420 --> 03:30:10,600
And we need the Royal Army's help for that.

4685
03:30:10,820 --> 03:30:12,580
I don't believe in forest land!

4686
03:30:13,360 --> 03:30:14,640
And that toad, Mooniel, too.

4687
03:30:17,140 --> 03:30:19,400
And we have to rescue the king of demons.

4688
03:30:20,460 --> 03:30:20,980
Oh.

4689
03:30:21,780 --> 03:30:23,200
Are we going back to Sandland?

4690
03:30:23,860 --> 03:30:26,960
Prince, you didn't forget about that, did you?

4691
03:30:27,840 --> 03:30:28,660
No, no, no!

4692
03:30:28,720 --> 03:30:29,620
Of course not!

4693
03:30:29,860 --> 03:30:31,080
We forgot about our dad?

4694
03:30:31,700 --> 03:30:33,780
That got warred in front of us?

4695
03:30:35,480 --> 03:30:36,660
Can't believe it.

4696
03:30:36,880 --> 03:30:38,500
Get out of there, Raul!

4697
03:30:39,580 --> 03:30:41,640
I gotta restock my stuff!

4698
03:30:42,480 --> 03:30:43,640
Alright, let's see.

4699
03:30:46,300 --> 03:30:47,820
Okay, we need a buy.

4700
03:30:48,100 --> 03:30:49,380
Okay, we have all the...

4701
03:30:49,400 --> 03:30:49,660
All the health.

4702
03:30:49,880 --> 03:30:51,340
So we need, like, repair kits.

4703
03:30:51,900 --> 03:30:54,380
Oh my god, we need so many repair kits.

4704
03:30:54,560 --> 03:30:55,800
Okay, we got repair kits.

4705
03:30:56,100 --> 03:30:58,200
Oh, let's grab some strength serum.

4706
03:30:58,340 --> 03:30:59,540
And then some...

4707
03:31:00,240 --> 03:31:01,840
Uh, firepower, too.

4708
03:31:02,280 --> 03:31:03,740
We'll grab firepower.

4709
03:31:04,720 --> 03:31:06,060
And... armor up.

4710
03:31:07,280 --> 03:31:07,800
Alright.

4711
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:09,620
Gabriel, thank you for the super chat!

4712
03:31:09,680 --> 03:31:10,580
Thank you, thank you!

4713
03:31:10,700 --> 03:31:11,400
It's your birthday?

4714
03:31:11,660 --> 03:31:13,280
Happy birthday to you!

4715
03:31:13,420 --> 03:31:15,180
Happy birthday to you!

4716
03:31:15,360 --> 03:31:17,160
Happy birthday, dear Gabriel!

4717
03:31:17,460 --> 03:31:18,940
Happy birthday to you!

4718
03:31:19,080 --> 03:31:19,340
Yay!

4719
03:31:20,060 --> 03:31:20,580
Woo!

4720
03:31:22,280 --> 03:31:22,800
Alright.

4721
03:31:23,560 --> 03:31:24,260
Let's see.

4722
03:31:24,620 --> 03:31:26,460
I feel like I don't need to upgrade anything.

4723
03:31:26,820 --> 03:31:27,840
Unless I have, like...

4724
03:31:27,840 --> 03:31:28,840
Do I have a machine gun?

4725
03:31:29,540 --> 03:31:31,580
Do I have a better machine gun after... finally?

4726
03:31:31,660 --> 03:31:32,200
After years?

4727
03:31:32,660 --> 03:31:33,340
Let's check.

4728
03:31:34,500 --> 03:31:35,540
Uh, dragoons.

4729
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:38,220
Nope.

4730
03:31:38,220 --> 03:31:40,720
Still the same old machine gun.

4731
03:31:41,340 --> 03:31:46,060
And you guys say my laser is, like, the best laser out of all of these.

4732
03:31:46,100 --> 03:31:47,540
So I believe you guys.

4733
03:31:48,640 --> 03:31:49,380
Oh my god.

4734
03:31:49,380 --> 03:31:50,860
But this one's 324!

4735
03:31:52,480 --> 03:31:53,080
Guys!

4736
03:31:53,300 --> 03:31:55,560
This one has 324!

4737
03:31:56,160 --> 03:31:57,700
Do I not take it?

4738
03:31:58,280 --> 03:31:59,360
It's, like, double!

4739
03:32:03,570 --> 03:32:04,170
Guys!

4740
03:32:06,050 --> 03:32:07,510
Is it not worth it?

4741
03:32:09,850 --> 03:32:12,190
But new laser, though.

4742
03:32:12,470 --> 03:32:14,030
But number big!

4743
03:32:18,150 --> 03:32:19,230
Oh, wait.

4744
03:32:19,870 --> 03:32:20,430
Uh...

4745
03:32:22,890 --> 03:32:24,810
But the number is big!

4746
03:32:25,090 --> 03:32:26,090
Number big!

4747
03:32:26,290 --> 03:32:26,730
Number...

4748
03:32:32,020 --> 03:32:33,040
Can it charge?

4749
03:32:33,400 --> 03:32:34,280
I guess not.

4750
03:32:37,300 --> 03:32:37,860
Okay.

4751
03:32:38,060 --> 03:32:39,980
Oh, the charge shot is bigger?

4752
03:32:40,240 --> 03:32:40,520
Oh!

4753
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:42,760
It doesn't count the charge shot.

4754
03:32:42,900 --> 03:32:44,100
Okay, I trust you guys.

4755
03:32:46,320 --> 03:32:47,560
I will be back.

4756
03:32:47,560 --> 03:32:48,060
Father.

4757
03:32:49,200 --> 03:32:49,840
Lung.

4758
03:32:51,360 --> 03:32:52,660
I'll be back, guys.

4759
03:32:53,160 --> 03:32:53,560
Anne.

4760
03:32:55,440 --> 03:32:56,080
Roommate!

4761
03:32:57,480 --> 03:32:58,120
You...

4762
03:32:59,640 --> 03:33:00,580
Can't leave.

4763
03:33:01,780 --> 03:33:04,360
If the Resistance flees to Sand Land.

4764
03:33:06,700 --> 03:33:09,960
Father said he'll wipe you out with garum.

4765
03:33:11,760 --> 03:33:13,380
Red will attack anyway.

4766
03:33:13,840 --> 03:33:15,360
Whether we go or not.

4767
03:33:18,180 --> 03:33:18,700
No.

4768
03:33:18,700 --> 03:33:20,420
That's not what my father wants.

4769
03:33:21,960 --> 03:33:23,120
Come on, Rosetta.

4770
03:33:23,360 --> 03:33:26,080
If she's talking a little slower than usual, we know why.

4771
03:33:27,660 --> 03:33:31,720
We might have fixed her bones, but I don't think you can get back brain cells.

4772
03:33:32,420 --> 03:33:33,920
It's just... very lonely.

4773
03:33:38,250 --> 03:33:38,770
Lonely?

4774
03:33:39,470 --> 03:33:40,590
He has no friends?

4775
03:33:43,670 --> 03:33:44,190
Wait.

4776
03:33:44,190 --> 03:33:46,630
I'm going to... take...

4777
03:33:46,630 --> 03:33:50,430
We can't let you go before you answer some questions.

4778
03:33:50,730 --> 03:33:55,330
He's just Mr. He murdered thousands of people, but he was so lonely.

4779
03:33:56,250 --> 03:33:57,750
You don't understand.

4780
03:33:58,070 --> 03:33:59,190
He has no friends.

4781
03:34:02,270 --> 03:34:05,010
I just... want more time.

4782
03:34:06,690 --> 03:34:07,370
Time?

4783
03:34:09,310 --> 03:34:12,350
I should have died... back at the Masama Dixite.

4784
03:34:12,350 --> 03:34:14,350
Oh, they should have died like at least two times.

4785
03:34:15,250 --> 03:34:19,090
But that tyke... didn't finish me off.

4786
03:34:19,470 --> 03:34:22,410
Who you calling a tyke?

4787
03:34:22,610 --> 03:34:23,090
Whoa!

4788
03:34:25,870 --> 03:34:26,590
Okay.

4789
03:34:27,730 --> 03:34:29,430
Anne told me...

4790
03:34:31,890 --> 03:34:36,050
All we really needed was to take the time to talk to each other.

4791
03:34:36,190 --> 03:34:36,890
Who wrote that?

4792
03:34:38,130 --> 03:34:39,970
Why that specific word?

4793
03:34:40,350 --> 03:34:40,950
Now...

4794
03:34:41,550 --> 03:34:44,890
I think I'm finally beginning to see what she meant.

4795
03:34:50,340 --> 03:34:53,280
I'd like to know what you think, Beelzebub.

4796
03:34:54,020 --> 03:34:57,520
Yeah, but why couldn't she say... kid?

4797
03:34:58,200 --> 03:34:58,720
No?

4798
03:35:01,280 --> 03:35:02,860
Because both you and Anne are the ones who achieved this end.

4799
03:35:02,860 --> 03:35:05,120
Why did they say it like that?

4800
03:35:06,560 --> 03:35:07,580
I don't care.

4801
03:35:07,600 --> 03:35:09,420
He said it sounds like a different word.

4802
03:35:10,260 --> 03:35:10,280
Whatever she wants.

4803
03:35:14,380 --> 03:35:16,140
And what do you think, Anne?

4804
03:35:22,540 --> 03:35:24,020
I want her...

4805
03:35:25,280 --> 03:35:26,320
to come with me.

4806
03:35:27,660 --> 03:35:29,260
Guys, remember, roommates...

4807
03:35:29,260 --> 03:35:31,540
they're just... very good friends.

4808
03:35:39,600 --> 03:35:42,220
You know how the saying goes...

4809
03:35:43,860 --> 03:35:46,160
Put water on an old fire...

4810
03:35:46,160 --> 03:35:47,880
but logs on a new one...

4811
03:35:47,880 --> 03:35:48,880
What the fuck does that mean?

4812
03:35:52,120 --> 03:35:52,660
What?

4813
03:35:52,680 --> 03:35:52,880
What?

4814
03:36:04,700 --> 03:36:05,240
Okay,

4815
03:36:09,320 --> 03:36:10,120
this is not fair!

4816
03:36:10,380 --> 03:36:10,920
Like...

4817
03:36:11,600 --> 03:36:15,040
Okay, Rosetta has the same hair color as her dad.

4818
03:36:17,620 --> 03:36:18,700
But... and...

4819
03:36:25,160 --> 03:36:26,540
That's all I'm saying.

4820
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:35,720
Because you guys are like, it's anime jeans, guys!

4821
03:36:36,180 --> 03:36:38,080
It's anime jeans!

4822
03:36:42,440 --> 03:36:46,920
Yeah, Santa exists in Sand Land.

4823
03:36:53,880 --> 03:36:54,740
Oh, here!

4824
03:36:55,080 --> 03:36:56,020
We're in...

4825
03:36:56,020 --> 03:36:57,400
Gar something.

4826
03:36:57,620 --> 03:36:58,620
I already forgot the ship's name.

4827
03:37:06,160 --> 03:37:10,180
What do you need the sand for?

4828
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:18,660
Just take over somewhere else!

4829
03:37:18,700 --> 03:37:19,600
There's nothing here!

4830
03:37:26,040 --> 03:37:26,640
What?

4831
03:37:27,660 --> 03:37:30,580
But the Supreme Commander ordered us to the capital!

4832
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:32,620
That can wait!

4833
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:35,920
We're pounding the village into the ground first!

4834
03:37:36,420 --> 03:37:38,360
That TV really fucked him up.

4835
03:37:38,520 --> 03:37:43,660
If we show the Royal Army Garim in action, surely they'll realize how futile resistance is.

4836
03:37:45,660 --> 03:37:47,980
Imagine all the glass you commit, doki!

4837
03:37:48,500 --> 03:37:50,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4838
03:37:52,200 --> 03:37:53,060
Very well.

4839
03:37:53,560 --> 03:37:56,000
Nothing wrong with saving the best for last.

4840
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:59,180
Have their- the-the sandwich is so poor!

4841
03:37:59,940 --> 03:38:01,840
They're all so poor!

4842
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:05,760
They just got watered!

4843
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:06,020
Yes!

4844
03:38:06,060 --> 03:38:08,460
They got watered last week!

4845
03:38:09,020 --> 03:38:12,960
The Royal Army's gigantic battleship is floating over the dam!

4846
03:38:14,400 --> 03:38:15,160
Dammit!

4847
03:38:15,160 --> 03:38:17,460
So Garim's entered Sand Land.

4848
03:38:19,700 --> 03:38:22,260
Oh my, I just don't understand.

4849
03:38:22,740 --> 03:38:25,240
What's so great about Sand Land?!

4850
03:38:25,240 --> 03:38:27,400
Everybody wants to leave Settler!

4851
03:38:36,340 --> 03:38:40,520
We're not even technol- technological diff- Oh my gosh.

4852
03:38:40,680 --> 03:38:41,260
I'm sorry.

4853
03:38:41,380 --> 03:38:42,420
English is my first language.

4854
03:38:42,660 --> 03:38:44,160
We don't even have the technology!

4855
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:46,500
They're more advanced than we are!

4856
03:38:48,980 --> 03:38:52,720
There's no way to know what a battle's outcome will be until it's fought.

4857
03:38:53,960 --> 03:38:56,440
You can use sad to make more TV.

4858
03:38:59,640 --> 03:39:00,760
Oh, Jenny, alright!

4859
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:02,040
You're still alive!

4860
03:39:03,200 --> 03:39:04,340
Walk slower, please.

4861
03:39:09,650 --> 03:39:12,750
It's like fucking... civ.

4862
03:39:16,890 --> 03:39:18,750
It's like civilization.

4863
03:39:18,990 --> 03:39:19,670
We're like a civilization.

4864
03:39:19,690 --> 03:39:22,390
We're like the cavemen and they're like fucking making a nuclear bomb.

4865
03:39:24,650 --> 03:39:26,590
Alright, time to talk to the general.

4866
03:39:30,100 --> 03:39:30,820
Alright, alright.

4867
03:39:33,120 --> 03:39:38,580
They can build sad- They had- I don't know if you guys know this, but Forestland has a beach!

4868
03:39:39,320 --> 03:39:41,700
Oh, he was over in the cl- in the garage.

4869
03:39:42,020 --> 03:39:42,240
Okay.

4870
03:39:44,620 --> 03:39:45,900
I was like, where did he go?

4871
03:39:49,080 --> 03:39:49,560
What?

4872
03:39:52,400 --> 03:39:53,520
Don't be racist!

4873
03:39:55,000 --> 03:39:55,760
Move away!

4874
03:39:56,040 --> 03:39:58,400
That woman's a forced land army general!

4875
03:39:58,620 --> 03:39:58,700
That woman's a forced land army general!

4876
03:39:59,060 --> 03:40:00,020
That woman's a forced land army general!

4877
03:40:00,860 --> 03:40:01,980
Not anymore!

4878
03:40:02,460 --> 03:40:03,940
Rosetta's no longer our enemy!

4879
03:40:08,590 --> 03:40:09,290
I'm not sure.

4880
03:40:12,230 --> 03:40:13,890
What do you mean, I'm not sure?

4881
03:40:14,210 --> 03:40:18,050
At the moment, I don't have a plan behind it here, nor would I if I didn't.

4882
03:40:18,050 --> 03:40:19,550
What do you mean, I'm not sure?

4883
03:40:21,290 --> 03:40:23,090
Let me assure you.

4884
03:40:23,310 --> 03:40:24,570
For the time being.

4885
03:40:24,890 --> 03:40:26,270
My priority is...

4886
03:40:26,270 --> 03:40:27,670
stopping my father.

4887
03:40:29,630 --> 03:40:32,890
Do you really expect me to trust an enemy general?

4888
03:40:35,610 --> 03:40:38,570
Do you have like a fucking mini heart attack there?

4889
03:40:38,890 --> 03:40:41,950
There's no way that your wound could have healed yet.

4890
03:40:42,390 --> 03:40:43,890
Oh, that's why he was limping.

4891
03:40:44,270 --> 03:40:45,730
Who do you think wounded me?

4892
03:40:46,030 --> 03:40:46,990
Her brigade.

4893
03:40:49,370 --> 03:40:52,090
I know how you feel, but she's not mine.

4894
03:40:52,090 --> 03:40:53,230
I'm not sure, babe.

4895
03:40:53,410 --> 03:40:54,090
Prince should know.

4896
03:40:59,710 --> 03:41:00,150
Yeah.

4897
03:41:00,330 --> 03:41:03,110
Far as I can tell, he doesn't have any bad intentions.

4898
03:41:05,850 --> 03:41:06,890
Not so dead, Paul.

4899
03:41:06,950 --> 03:41:07,670
Thank you for the super chat.

4900
03:41:07,730 --> 03:41:08,030
Thank you.

4901
03:41:08,030 --> 03:41:08,550
Thank you.

4902
03:41:08,550 --> 03:41:10,130
Doki, that flick made her confused.

4903
03:41:10,270 --> 03:41:11,070
Give her a break.

4904
03:41:11,330 --> 03:41:12,670
Thank you for the super chat.

4905
03:41:12,670 --> 03:41:13,130
Thank you.

4906
03:41:13,510 --> 03:41:15,910
Is everybody injured?

4907
03:41:16,030 --> 03:41:17,290
Who's like not injured?

4908
03:41:17,870 --> 03:41:18,690
Where are you going?

4909
03:41:18,850 --> 03:41:21,050
I feel like I fought more and I'm okay.

4910
03:41:22,490 --> 03:41:27,870
I don't want to invite undue suspicion by making you worry I'm spying on your war council.

4911
03:41:35,900 --> 03:41:38,020
First, I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts.

4912
03:41:42,660 --> 03:41:43,180
Alright.

4913
03:41:43,180 --> 03:41:44,260
Chat with everyone.

4914
03:41:44,540 --> 03:41:47,180
You've fought the battle with that flying fortress long enough.

4915
03:41:48,320 --> 03:41:51,920
Their aquanium energy will have to run out at some point, right?

4916
03:41:51,980 --> 03:41:54,220
You mean like hundreds of thousands of years?

4917
03:41:54,360 --> 03:41:57,160
Because the aquaniums still work in those old wreckage.

4918
03:41:57,540 --> 03:41:57,820
That's true.

4919
03:41:58,160 --> 03:42:01,360
But how are we supposed to survive long enough for that to happen?

4920
03:42:01,380 --> 03:42:01,660
Yeah.

4921
03:42:01,660 --> 03:42:02,760
That's not a great idea.

4922
03:42:03,620 --> 03:42:04,060
Well...

4923
03:42:06,720 --> 03:42:08,840
Realize you hadn't really thought this through, huh?

4924
03:42:08,920 --> 03:42:09,760
Yeah, that's a terrible idea.

4925
03:42:10,180 --> 03:42:12,340
I was just taking my time thinking of the best strategy.

4926
03:42:12,340 --> 03:42:13,920
This is why we shouldn't have talked to everybody.

4927
03:42:14,320 --> 03:42:14,460
No.

4928
03:42:14,620 --> 03:42:17,540
Our only option is to attack so swiftly...

4929
03:42:19,060 --> 03:42:21,620
...that the enemy isn't given any time to think.

4930
03:42:22,940 --> 03:42:24,800
Yeah, they should have given her the Santa outfit.

4931
03:42:25,040 --> 03:42:28,660
Do you think Brad would be willing to talk if we could get Rosetta to contact him?

4932
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:32,120
If he'd agree to a meeting, I'd speak with him in person.

4933
03:42:32,120 --> 03:42:33,700
Even if I had to go alone...

4934
03:42:33,700 --> 03:42:37,120
Okay, we're not going alone in an arm with an angel on their side.

4935
03:42:37,340 --> 03:42:39,840
If Brad were a man of reason, he would have listened to King Jam.

4936
03:42:40,520 --> 03:42:41,780
That's a fair point.

4937
03:42:42,420 --> 03:42:44,640
Maybe fighting is the only way.

4938
03:42:44,840 --> 03:42:49,460
I just hope we can settle this without getting civilians of either country involved.

4939
03:42:51,900 --> 03:42:54,520
Alright, apparently everybody had bad ideas.

4940
03:42:54,880 --> 03:42:56,440
So we should not listen to everybody.

4941
03:42:56,880 --> 03:42:56,960
What's that big people look?

4942
03:42:57,280 --> 03:43:00,200
Its main cannon is unimaginably powerful.

4943
03:43:00,200 --> 03:43:03,520
They could easily destroy the whole world if they wanted to.

4944
03:43:03,880 --> 03:43:07,380
To make things worse, it's too high up for our tanks to hit.

4945
03:43:07,940 --> 03:43:12,440
And even if they could, it's so massive that they wouldn't leave a dent.

4946
03:43:12,840 --> 03:43:18,480
The only options I can think of are to take control of the command center or somehow immobilize it.

4947
03:43:19,600 --> 03:43:22,600
Then how about we bust in there and kick their butts right now?

4948
03:43:22,600 --> 03:43:28,340
Wait, so the General had the only good idea because he's a General by the way, so he's used to making up- making plans.

4949
03:43:28,540 --> 03:43:30,180
Then why the fuck did we get in there?

4950
03:43:30,180 --> 03:43:30,980
We got input from you two!

4951
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:47,620
He wanted to feel involved.

4952
03:43:47,940 --> 03:43:48,620
Doki.

4953
03:43:49,140 --> 03:43:51,180
This is a team effort.

4954
03:43:51,800 --> 03:43:56,480
We need an airplane fast enough to dodge anti-air missiles.

4955
03:43:57,520 --> 03:43:59,160
Come to think of it...

4956
03:43:59,160 --> 03:44:00,020
We'll have a plane?

4957
03:44:00,240 --> 03:44:06,320
How exactly did the forest land army transport that Aquanium from the In-Ville base?

4958
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:07,420
Yeah.

4959
03:44:07,720 --> 03:44:08,300
What do you mean?

4960
03:44:09,240 --> 03:44:14,380
We used a radar device attuned to Aquanium to detect some at one of their bases.

4961
03:44:14,760 --> 03:44:19,900
And as we were watching, it then zoomed to a distant location at an incredible speed.

4962
03:44:19,900 --> 03:44:22,700
It might have been carried by an airplane.

4963
03:44:23,040 --> 03:44:23,820
They have airplanes?

4964
03:44:24,080 --> 03:44:24,780
It had to be.

4965
03:44:24,880 --> 03:44:27,140
It was moving in a straight line on the radar.

4966
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:29,480
Yes.

4967
03:44:29,480 --> 03:44:32,560
Any form of ground transport would have been affected by the terrain.

4968
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:34,880
Only an airplane could pull that off.

4969
03:44:35,120 --> 03:44:36,380
But where did it land?

4970
03:44:36,400 --> 03:44:37,540
Are we advanced enough?

4971
03:44:37,540 --> 03:44:39,000
We didn't see it there at the Masala dig site.

4972
03:44:39,920 --> 03:44:40,800
Rosetta would know.

4973
03:44:41,020 --> 03:44:41,980
Let me ask her.

4974
03:44:43,680 --> 03:44:45,880
Rosetta, are we advanced enough for planes?

4975
03:44:48,740 --> 03:44:49,640
Oh my god.

4976
03:44:50,520 --> 03:44:52,560
Rosetta, I want to drive a plane.

4977
03:44:53,340 --> 03:44:55,200
Why don't you look chipper?

4978
03:44:55,700 --> 03:44:57,600
That depends on your next answer.

4979
03:44:58,120 --> 03:45:00,440
Are you saying you want my help?

4980
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:02,660
I won't ask you to fight.

4981
03:45:03,640 --> 03:45:07,100
I just want to know where the forest land army's airplane is.

4982
03:45:07,320 --> 03:45:09,060
It's one singular airplane.

4983
03:45:09,440 --> 03:45:09,860
The airplane?

4984
03:45:10,520 --> 03:45:11,240
The airplane.

4985
03:45:11,320 --> 03:45:12,460
Okay, we only have one.

4986
03:45:15,440 --> 03:45:19,580
You tell there's only one when they're like the airplane.

4987
03:45:19,640 --> 03:45:20,000
The airplane.

4988
03:45:20,160 --> 03:45:21,680
Not the airplanes.

4989
03:45:29,780 --> 03:45:32,260
Just one singular plane.

4990
03:45:32,640 --> 03:45:34,980
We have 500,000 tanks.

4991
03:45:35,580 --> 03:45:37,800
I'll do whatever it takes to stop bread.

4992
03:45:38,640 --> 03:45:41,040
I want to fly the airplane once we get it.

4993
03:45:41,500 --> 03:45:43,720
The Sunobi Zero airplane.

4994
03:45:44,460 --> 03:45:44,780
I want to fly it.

4995
03:45:45,620 --> 03:45:49,480
Now that you mention it, I've never gotten to pilot an airplane before.

4996
03:45:50,980 --> 03:45:53,120
Even the old man wants to give it a spin.

4997
03:45:53,340 --> 03:45:53,840
Oh no.

4998
03:45:54,420 --> 03:45:57,260
Guys, I think there might be zero planes soon.

4999
03:45:57,760 --> 03:45:58,060
No.

5000
03:45:58,180 --> 03:46:01,080
I'll do what I can to distract them from the ground with my tank unit.

5001
03:46:03,760 --> 03:46:05,020
In that case...

5002
03:46:05,020 --> 03:46:06,960
Yeah, but that's in Sand Land.

5003
03:46:07,200 --> 03:46:09,900
Even in Forest Land, there's one plane.

5004
03:46:09,980 --> 03:46:11,260
That's what I'm saying.

5005
03:46:11,600 --> 03:46:13,200
You have too many decoys, right?

5006
03:46:14,060 --> 03:46:17,520
The king might have outlawed planes in Sand Land.

5007
03:46:17,520 --> 03:46:20,140
But why does the Forest Land only have one?

5008
03:46:23,240 --> 03:46:25,200
I'm used to not having things easy.

5009
03:46:25,620 --> 03:46:26,140
Whoa.

5010
03:46:29,040 --> 03:46:31,680
No, you're supposed to be a Romain Rosetta.

5011
03:46:36,560 --> 03:46:37,980
Alright, let's see.

5012
03:46:38,480 --> 03:46:39,460
Yeah, this way.

5013
03:46:39,600 --> 03:46:41,000
We have to go to...

5014
03:46:45,160 --> 03:46:47,260
Alright, we have to go to... What the fuck?

5015
03:46:47,280 --> 03:46:48,420
How am I on the bike?

5016
03:46:49,560 --> 03:46:50,740
Okay, we gotta go to...

5017
03:46:51,460 --> 03:46:53,000
Back to Forest Land we go.

5018
03:46:56,760 --> 03:46:57,240
Alright.

5019
03:46:59,280 --> 03:47:01,920
Yeah, I found it.

5020
03:47:02,100 --> 03:47:03,060
How do we get up there?

5021
03:47:05,280 --> 03:47:06,760
Alright, I need to figure out how to get up.

5022
03:47:09,040 --> 03:47:10,860
I'm gonna assume it's this way.

5023
03:47:14,440 --> 03:47:16,480
Oh my god, how the fuck?

5024
03:47:17,200 --> 03:47:18,960
I assume it's like up like that.

5025
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:20,660
Alright, it's time to get on the bike.

5026
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:23,600
Alright.

5027
03:47:23,780 --> 03:47:24,140
Alright.

5028
03:47:24,140 --> 03:47:26,620
If I go from here...

5029
03:47:26,620 --> 03:47:29,840
This should lead me to the mountain.

5030
03:47:30,380 --> 03:47:30,980
Right?

5031
03:47:31,320 --> 03:47:32,100
Yeah, it does.

5032
03:47:33,200 --> 03:47:33,800
Alright.

5033
03:47:33,840 --> 03:47:33,920
Wow!

5034
03:47:36,840 --> 03:47:38,300
Just one rock.

5035
03:47:38,360 --> 03:47:39,100
Alright, okay.

5036
03:47:39,200 --> 03:47:40,160
Just a rock.

5037
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:41,200
Ooh!

5038
03:47:41,780 --> 03:47:42,240
There's loot.

5039
03:47:43,760 --> 03:47:44,360
No...

5040
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:47,600
Alright.

5041
03:47:49,840 --> 03:47:51,020
Wait, there's bees?

5042
03:47:51,080 --> 03:47:51,100
Yeah.

5043
03:47:51,120 --> 03:47:51,480
Bees?

5044
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:54,100
They have bees?

5045
03:47:54,480 --> 03:47:55,520
They have bees?

5046
03:47:55,520 --> 03:47:56,200
No, that's your dog.

5047
03:47:56,260 --> 03:47:57,240
Oh shit, sorry.

5048
03:47:57,300 --> 03:47:58,340
I'm shooting the wrong way.

5049
03:47:59,260 --> 03:48:00,260
What the fuck?

5050
03:48:00,500 --> 03:48:00,800
What the fuck?

5051
03:48:00,800 --> 03:48:02,600
Oh my god, they do have bees!

5052
03:48:02,820 --> 03:48:03,180
What the fuck?

5053
03:48:03,180 --> 03:48:04,220
I get honey from this!

5054
03:48:04,400 --> 03:48:04,700
Well...

5055
03:48:05,340 --> 03:48:07,240
I don't know about that.

5056
03:48:07,540 --> 03:48:07,720
I don't know about that.

5057
03:48:07,720 --> 03:48:08,380
Where's the queen?

5058
03:48:10,240 --> 03:48:10,740
Where's the queen?

5059
03:48:10,740 --> 03:48:11,540
Not the bees.

5060
03:48:11,700 --> 03:48:11,860
Not the bees.

5061
03:48:11,860 --> 03:48:12,080
The bees!

5062
03:48:12,800 --> 03:48:12,840
The bees!

5063
03:48:13,400 --> 03:48:15,000
Wait, but where's the queen then?

5064
03:48:15,340 --> 03:48:15,360
Wait, but where's the queen then?

5065
03:48:15,480 --> 03:48:16,720
I don't see no queen.

5066
03:48:17,180 --> 03:48:17,280
I don't see no queen.

5067
03:48:18,340 --> 03:48:19,580
Okay, we go this way.

5068
03:48:19,800 --> 03:48:19,880
Okay, we go this way.

5069
03:48:19,880 --> 03:48:22,120
Oh, that's the Omega Raptor.

5070
03:48:22,160 --> 03:48:24,000
Not as cool as the Alpha Raptors.

5071
03:48:25,560 --> 03:48:26,960
Is this this way?

5072
03:48:28,920 --> 03:48:30,000
I'm a little lost.

5073
03:48:30,280 --> 03:48:31,380
How do we get up there?

5074
03:48:33,000 --> 03:48:33,560
Uh...

5075
03:48:34,460 --> 03:48:35,020
Here?

5076
03:48:37,860 --> 03:48:39,120
Oh, there's more bees.

5077
03:48:40,060 --> 03:48:41,660
How do we get up though?

5078
03:48:43,840 --> 03:48:44,400
Uh...

5079
03:48:44,400 --> 03:48:46,640
Is there like a way up?

5080
03:48:47,100 --> 03:48:48,300
Oh no, there's loot though.

5081
03:48:48,480 --> 03:48:49,040
Oh no, there's loot though.

5082
03:48:51,580 --> 03:48:52,640
Alright, nice.

5083
03:48:52,920 --> 03:48:53,880
We got boosters.

5084
03:48:55,420 --> 03:48:59,420
I feel like it's definitely not from this way, so we're gonna drop down.

5085
03:49:00,540 --> 03:49:01,180
Uh...

5086
03:49:01,180 --> 03:49:03,480
Maybe from around here.

5087
03:49:04,880 --> 03:49:06,460
Maybe it's here?

5088
03:49:08,140 --> 03:49:09,340
Oh my god.

5089
03:49:09,680 --> 03:49:10,660
I'm lost!

5090
03:49:11,580 --> 03:49:13,220
I'm so lost!

5091
03:49:14,400 --> 03:49:16,280
How the fuck did you...

5092
03:49:16,280 --> 03:49:17,180
Oh my god.

5093
03:49:17,260 --> 03:49:19,660
Okay, clearly that wasn't...

5094
03:49:19,660 --> 03:49:19,860
Oh, I'm so lost.

5095
03:49:19,880 --> 03:49:20,520
High ground.

5096
03:49:22,840 --> 03:49:23,320
Uh...

5097
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:26,160
What the fuck?

5098
03:49:28,780 --> 03:49:29,600
Not again!

5099
03:49:29,940 --> 03:49:30,820
Not again.

5100
03:49:30,940 --> 03:49:31,540
Wait, where...

5101
03:49:31,540 --> 03:49:31,860
Where...

5102
03:49:31,860 --> 03:49:33,060
What the hell?

5103
03:49:33,140 --> 03:49:34,960
Where did these guys come from?

5104
03:49:35,440 --> 03:49:36,320
Is it here?

5105
03:49:37,820 --> 03:49:39,040
Does this go up?

5106
03:49:39,260 --> 03:49:40,580
This has to go up.

5107
03:49:44,500 --> 03:49:45,480
I think it's here.

5108
03:49:46,140 --> 03:49:46,620
Yeah.

5109
03:49:47,860 --> 03:49:48,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5110
03:49:48,640 --> 03:49:49,220
Okay, we did it.

5111
03:49:49,260 --> 03:49:50,120
We figured it out, guys.

5112
03:49:51,440 --> 03:49:52,040
We figured...

5113
03:49:52,040 --> 03:49:52,160
Oh!

5114
03:49:52,440 --> 03:49:53,740
A bush!

5115
03:49:54,460 --> 03:49:54,920
I...

5116
03:49:54,920 --> 03:49:55,400
Okay.

5117
03:49:55,960 --> 03:49:56,760
Alright.

5118
03:49:57,640 --> 03:49:59,720
The bush got me, chat.

5119
03:49:59,840 --> 03:50:02,100
The fucking bush got me.

5120
03:50:04,440 --> 03:50:05,240
Alright.

5121
03:50:05,420 --> 03:50:06,380
We're doing it.

5122
03:50:07,000 --> 03:50:09,000
The goddamn bush.

5123
03:50:11,120 --> 03:50:12,200
Alright, up we go.

5124
03:50:12,460 --> 03:50:12,880
Weeeee!

5125
03:50:14,320 --> 03:50:15,960
That one bush.

5126
03:50:16,300 --> 03:50:20,700
This bike managed to run past raptors and mechs.

5127
03:50:20,760 --> 03:50:21,020
Ah!

5128
03:50:23,100 --> 03:50:24,880
Except for that one mech.

5129
03:50:32,060 --> 03:50:32,660
Except...

5130
03:50:32,660 --> 03:50:32,980
No!

5131
03:50:33,200 --> 03:50:34,260
Are you serious?

5132
03:50:35,060 --> 03:50:37,300
I have to do that again!

5133
03:50:37,760 --> 03:50:39,600
Oh, my God.

5134
03:50:40,300 --> 03:50:41,300
I have to...

5135
03:50:41,300 --> 03:50:43,140
I have to do this again.

5136
03:50:43,300 --> 03:50:44,180
Are you serious?

5137
03:50:44,260 --> 03:50:46,200
I don't remember how I got there.

5138
03:50:46,600 --> 03:50:47,740
How the fuck...

5139
03:50:47,740 --> 03:50:48,140
Okay.

5140
03:50:48,380 --> 03:50:49,900
How did I get there?

5141
03:50:50,380 --> 03:50:51,140
Oh, okay.

5142
03:50:51,200 --> 03:50:51,620
Is this me?

5143
03:50:51,840 --> 03:50:52,440
Me.

5144
03:50:53,140 --> 03:50:53,940
Oh, okay.

5145
03:50:53,940 --> 03:50:54,480
Okay.

5146
03:50:54,480 --> 03:50:54,500
Okay.

5147
03:50:54,500 --> 03:50:55,620
Oh, my God.

5148
03:50:56,920 --> 03:50:58,440
I can't believe it.

5149
03:50:58,440 --> 03:51:00,380
I have to ride my bike all over again.

5150
03:51:02,380 --> 03:51:04,260
Some of you don't have the honey as well?

5151
03:51:04,840 --> 03:51:06,820
I think they took my honey too.

5152
03:51:07,180 --> 03:51:07,560
No!

5153
03:51:09,420 --> 03:51:11,880
I killed those bees for nothing!

5154
03:51:12,980 --> 03:51:13,840
Hey, there's a radio tower.

5155
03:51:14,900 --> 03:51:17,780
In a place like this, you can see it from far away.

5156
03:51:18,000 --> 03:51:18,520
Oh, okay.

5157
03:51:18,600 --> 03:51:19,260
I still want to extract.

5158
03:51:19,260 --> 03:51:21,360
We can use it as a landmark if we get lost.

5159
03:51:21,860 --> 03:51:22,380
Okay.

5160
03:51:22,460 --> 03:51:23,640
Not the honey.

5161
03:51:25,960 --> 03:51:26,960
All right.

5162
03:51:27,800 --> 03:51:28,600
You know what?

5163
03:51:28,700 --> 03:51:30,460
These don't really matter anyway.

5164
03:51:30,860 --> 03:51:32,860
I think it was like from here, right?

5165
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:34,800
How do we...

5166
03:51:34,800 --> 03:51:36,300
How do we do this again?

5167
03:51:37,100 --> 03:51:38,300
I don't remember.

5168
03:51:38,640 --> 03:51:39,480
Oh, it's this way.

5169
03:51:39,540 --> 03:51:40,400
It's this way, right?

5170
03:51:40,520 --> 03:51:41,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5171
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:42,020
It's from here.

5172
03:51:42,540 --> 03:51:43,220
All right.

5173
03:51:44,360 --> 03:51:45,940
They took my wife.

5174
03:51:47,320 --> 03:51:49,060
I can't believe it.

5175
03:51:49,120 --> 03:51:50,780
Got cucked by a honey bee.

5176
03:51:51,080 --> 03:51:53,520
Thick vegetation makes for easy ambushes.

5177
03:51:53,520 --> 03:51:53,620
I'm not sure if that's the right word.

5178
03:51:55,140 --> 03:51:55,580
All right.

5179
03:51:55,740 --> 03:51:56,160
Okay.

5180
03:51:56,280 --> 03:51:56,840
This time...

5181
03:51:56,840 --> 03:51:58,200
We're okay this time.

5182
03:51:59,660 --> 03:52:01,360
I'm not lost this time, guys.

5183
03:52:01,460 --> 03:52:02,320
I figured it out.

5184
03:52:02,960 --> 03:52:06,120
That's certainly something to keep in mind when in the jungle.

5185
03:52:06,300 --> 03:52:06,520
Okay.

5186
03:52:06,520 --> 03:52:08,600
I'm going to make sure I have my nitro boost.

5187
03:52:10,120 --> 03:52:11,460
My nitro boost ready.

5188
03:52:12,840 --> 03:52:13,280
Whoa.

5189
03:52:16,160 --> 03:52:17,040
Oh, shit.

5190
03:52:17,240 --> 03:52:17,540
Okay.

5191
03:52:17,620 --> 03:52:18,100
That's fine.

5192
03:52:18,240 --> 03:52:19,020
My bike is okay.

5193
03:52:19,920 --> 03:52:20,560
It's okay.

5194
03:52:21,260 --> 03:52:22,800
It's just a little injured.

5195
03:52:23,080 --> 03:52:23,600
He is...

5196
03:52:23,600 --> 03:52:25,440
He punched... See, that's what I was saying!

5197
03:52:25,860 --> 03:52:29,680
He literally punched my bike, but that does nothing!

5198
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:33,000
Like, that's so bullshit!

5199
03:52:33,220 --> 03:52:36,080
He punched my bike, but I'm still on it!

5200
03:52:36,320 --> 03:52:37,240
But a bush!

5201
03:52:42,040 --> 03:52:44,000
The bush was our line.

5202
03:52:50,260 --> 03:52:52,160
Please no stealth, please.

5203
03:52:53,600 --> 03:52:55,480
Go ahead and sneak in if you're chicken.

5204
03:52:56,380 --> 03:52:57,440
I will.

5205
03:52:59,440 --> 03:53:01,560
Us guys are going through the front, right?

5206
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:09,420
Cowards!

5207
03:53:09,720 --> 03:53:10,260
Pussies!

5208
03:53:12,640 --> 03:53:14,740
I don't need a sneak in!

5209
03:53:16,620 --> 03:53:18,140
I ain't no coward!

5210
03:53:19,400 --> 03:53:20,600
I have a tank!

5211
03:53:21,120 --> 03:53:22,560
Oh, they did it!

5212
03:53:24,300 --> 03:53:25,500
Oh wait, no, I did it.

5213
03:53:30,220 --> 03:53:31,060
I have a distraction!

5214
03:53:31,480 --> 03:53:32,020
I can do this!

5215
03:53:38,880 --> 03:53:39,920
The bug man!

5216
03:53:41,260 --> 03:53:41,880
There's more?

5217
03:53:49,000 --> 03:53:49,600
There's more!

5218
03:53:52,000 --> 03:53:52,760
Okay, please.

5219
03:53:52,940 --> 03:53:54,300
Please tell me I can summon my tank.

5220
03:53:56,600 --> 03:53:57,120
Oh, thank god.

5221
03:53:57,280 --> 03:53:58,260
Oh my god.

5222
03:53:58,700 --> 03:54:01,180
Alright, Hanta, thank you for the super chat.

5223
03:54:01,280 --> 03:54:02,220
Thank you, thank you!

5224
03:54:02,480 --> 03:54:04,240
So here you are, poetry.

5225
03:54:04,700 --> 03:54:06,020
No, I'm not chicken!

5226
03:54:06,680 --> 03:54:07,720
That's different!

5227
03:54:10,640 --> 03:54:11,640
Okay, nice.

5228
03:54:13,220 --> 03:54:15,080
There's different types of birds!

5229
03:54:18,720 --> 03:54:19,240
No!

5230
03:54:19,680 --> 03:54:20,600
I don't want to go in there!

5231
03:54:21,400 --> 03:54:23,000
No, he kicked me off!

5232
03:54:23,200 --> 03:54:24,640
You're not allowed to drive!

5233
03:54:24,640 --> 03:54:26,240
Are you serious?

5234
03:54:26,240 --> 03:54:27,320
Are you serious?

5235
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:31,120
They did not see the tank!

5236
03:54:31,360 --> 03:54:33,060
They did not see the giant tank!

5237
03:54:33,260 --> 03:54:34,020
That's okay.

5238
03:54:34,560 --> 03:54:35,280
Alright.

5239
03:54:35,920 --> 03:54:38,660
They didn't see the giant fucking tank.

5240
03:54:38,820 --> 03:54:41,800
So now I have to do a stealth mission.

5241
03:54:42,480 --> 03:54:43,200
Okay.

5242
03:54:48,180 --> 03:54:49,380
Anybody here?

5243
03:54:50,440 --> 03:54:51,660
Can I cheese this?

5244
03:54:53,600 --> 03:54:55,700
They can't see me if I'm...

5245
03:54:55,700 --> 03:54:56,180
No!

5246
03:54:56,180 --> 03:54:58,540
They can look up!

5247
03:55:02,020 --> 03:55:03,220
Is that fair?

5248
03:55:04,080 --> 03:55:05,960
Why can't they look up?

5249
03:55:06,480 --> 03:55:07,240
Wait, where am I?

5250
03:55:07,360 --> 03:55:08,120
Oh, I made it here.

5251
03:55:08,320 --> 03:55:09,180
I got a checkpoint.

5252
03:55:09,460 --> 03:55:10,380
Okay, nice.

5253
03:55:11,080 --> 03:55:12,680
I got a checkpoint, guys.

5254
03:55:14,820 --> 03:55:16,320
No, I don't know where to go.

5255
03:55:16,540 --> 03:55:17,520
There's no yellow.

5256
03:55:19,520 --> 03:55:20,300
Here we go.

5257
03:55:24,180 --> 03:55:25,000
Okay, boom!

5258
03:55:28,380 --> 03:55:29,660
What do I do?

5259
03:55:29,660 --> 03:55:30,660
What do I do when there's no yellow?

5260
03:55:33,660 --> 03:55:34,380
I'm scared.

5261
03:55:34,740 --> 03:55:34,840
I'm scared.

5262
03:55:35,060 --> 03:55:35,180
Oh.

5263
03:55:37,680 --> 03:55:38,780
What do I do?

5264
03:55:38,820 --> 03:55:40,040
There's no yellow anywhere!

5265
03:55:42,900 --> 03:55:43,940
Is he gonna turn around?

5266
03:55:45,720 --> 03:55:46,260
Is he gonna turn around?

5267
03:55:46,420 --> 03:55:48,340
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5268
03:55:48,640 --> 03:55:48,760
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5269
03:55:50,400 --> 03:55:50,860
Okay.

5270
03:55:55,900 --> 03:55:56,360
Hehehehe.

5271
03:55:58,320 --> 03:55:58,780
Hehehehe.

5272
03:55:59,500 --> 03:55:59,960
Hehehehe.

5273
03:56:00,880 --> 03:56:02,840
I'm doing it my way.

5274
03:56:04,740 --> 03:56:05,220
Okay.

5275
03:56:06,380 --> 03:56:06,860
Whoa!

5276
03:56:07,040 --> 03:56:07,760
What the fuck?

5277
03:56:07,780 --> 03:56:08,840
How do I get across from there?

5278
03:56:11,760 --> 03:56:12,500
Wait, what?

5279
03:56:15,180 --> 03:56:17,800
Okay, I need to, like, figure this out, guys.

5280
03:56:19,280 --> 03:56:20,940
Oh, do I get through the poles?

5281
03:56:21,240 --> 03:56:22,660
No, that's not it.

5282
03:56:22,780 --> 03:56:24,340
Okay, now I'm a little lost.

5283
03:56:24,860 --> 03:56:25,980
Guys, why?

5284
03:56:26,360 --> 03:56:27,860
How do I get there?

5285
03:56:28,620 --> 03:56:29,800
Oh, I'm so scared.

5286
03:56:29,800 --> 03:56:29,940
I'm so scared.

5287
03:56:29,940 --> 03:56:31,560
There's so many people.

5288
03:56:35,230 --> 03:56:37,610
Oh, my God, there's so many people.

5289
03:56:40,690 --> 03:56:42,710
The tank can see me, too?

5290
03:56:43,390 --> 03:56:44,690
That should be illegal.

5291
03:56:46,590 --> 03:56:47,910
There's yellow paint there.

5292
03:56:47,950 --> 03:56:49,250
How do I get through that yellow paint?

5293
03:56:53,010 --> 03:56:53,530
Okay.

5294
03:56:55,570 --> 03:56:56,670
I'm gonna scare him.

5295
03:56:58,410 --> 03:56:58,930
Alright.

5296
03:57:00,850 --> 03:57:02,450
How do I scare the tank?

5297
03:57:02,870 --> 03:57:05,330
Guys, how do I scare the tank?

5298
03:57:06,330 --> 03:57:06,610
How do I scare the tank?

5299
03:57:08,350 --> 03:57:08,790
Ladder.

5300
03:57:08,790 --> 03:57:09,150
The ladder.

5301
03:57:09,210 --> 03:57:09,770
I see the ladder.

5302
03:57:10,710 --> 03:57:11,770
I see the ladder.

5303
03:57:13,470 --> 03:57:14,790
I'm improvising right now.

5304
03:57:14,830 --> 03:57:16,330
I don't know how to actually do this.

5305
03:57:18,510 --> 03:57:18,950
Oh.

5306
03:57:20,030 --> 03:57:21,470
Okay, we scare him.

5307
03:57:24,690 --> 03:57:25,490
And we climb.

5308
03:57:26,090 --> 03:57:27,570
We climb the ladder's yellow.

5309
03:57:30,110 --> 03:57:31,550
Now, how do I get across?

5310
03:57:35,460 --> 03:57:36,700
What the fuck?

5311
03:57:36,840 --> 03:57:37,740
What the fuck?

5312
03:57:41,320 --> 03:57:43,700
I'm so confused.

5313
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:44,740
I'm so confused.

5314
03:57:45,320 --> 03:57:46,160
I'm so confused.

5315
03:57:47,240 --> 03:57:48,080
How?

5316
03:57:48,580 --> 03:57:49,420
How?

5317
03:57:49,640 --> 03:57:50,480
How?

5318
03:57:54,740 --> 03:57:55,580
Wait.

5319
03:57:55,800 --> 03:57:56,200
How?

5320
03:58:02,240 --> 03:58:03,920
There's an open window?

5321
03:58:04,360 --> 03:58:05,200
There's an open window?

5322
03:58:05,800 --> 03:58:06,540
Oh!

5323
03:58:08,840 --> 03:58:09,820
That's how.

5324
03:58:10,160 --> 03:58:10,340
That's how.

5325
03:58:11,960 --> 03:58:12,720
Okay, but like...

5326
03:58:13,640 --> 03:58:14,820
This is just loot.

5327
03:58:17,840 --> 03:58:18,740
That's just loot.

5328
03:58:18,940 --> 03:58:19,500
That's not...

5329
03:58:19,500 --> 03:58:20,080
That's not how!

5330
03:58:22,260 --> 03:58:23,140
That's just loot!

5331
03:58:24,840 --> 03:58:25,560
Oh, there!

5332
03:58:25,620 --> 03:58:26,120
It's over there!

5333
03:58:28,660 --> 03:58:30,060
It's at the back!

5334
03:58:30,840 --> 03:58:31,760
Okay, we got it.

5335
03:58:32,420 --> 03:58:33,240
We got it.

5336
03:58:33,320 --> 03:58:34,720
We don't need loot anymore, guys.

5337
03:58:36,800 --> 03:58:37,740
We don't need loot.

5338
03:58:39,120 --> 03:58:40,320
We're here for the plane!

5339
03:58:40,620 --> 03:58:41,060
We're here for the plane!

5340
03:58:41,960 --> 03:58:42,740
This is enough loot for me.

5341
03:58:47,720 --> 03:58:49,440
You haven't even seen the plane before!

5342
03:58:52,480 --> 03:58:54,020
There's no plane to send then!

5343
03:58:54,020 --> 03:58:54,880
You got here first?

5344
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:56,200
Slowpokes.

5345
03:58:57,160 --> 03:59:00,060
I got here before all of you, actually.

5346
03:59:02,080 --> 03:59:03,360
Wait, you got caught?

5347
03:59:04,440 --> 03:59:08,580
No, I was searching the cells and the door locked closed behind me.

5348
03:59:08,800 --> 03:59:10,140
Yeah, sure Ann.

5349
03:59:11,640 --> 03:59:12,240
Sheesh.

5350
03:59:12,640 --> 03:59:13,920
Talk about facial beauty.

5351
03:59:13,920 --> 03:59:14,460
Sure.

5352
03:59:15,000 --> 03:59:16,400
That's what they all say.

5353
03:59:22,650 --> 03:59:23,250
Thanks.

5354
03:59:25,070 --> 03:59:27,270
So, let me get this ready.

5355
03:59:27,350 --> 03:59:27,750
Okay.

5356
03:59:31,080 --> 03:59:32,700
How does she know how to fix planes?

5357
03:59:33,200 --> 03:59:34,640
She's never seen a plane before.

5358
03:59:34,760 --> 03:59:35,880
There's literally one plane!

5359
03:59:40,700 --> 03:59:41,740
Get on it.

5360
03:59:42,720 --> 03:59:44,060
Oh, Raul, get on the plane.

5361
03:59:54,010 --> 03:59:55,870
Oh my god, the insect men!

5362
03:59:56,210 --> 03:59:58,270
They let them integrate with the humans?

5363
03:59:59,530 --> 04:00:00,590
That's very like...

5364
04:00:01,170 --> 04:00:02,910
Because you gave us away with your yelling!

5365
04:00:03,250 --> 04:00:03,870
Shut up!

5366
04:00:03,950 --> 04:00:05,330
That's very progressive of them.

5367
04:00:05,330 --> 04:00:09,210
You already let the insect men integrate with the rest of the humans.

5368
04:00:11,810 --> 04:00:13,370
It's a tank with wings.

5369
04:00:18,970 --> 04:00:20,630
Hold on tight, everyone!

5370
04:00:21,750 --> 04:00:22,630
But demons...

5371
04:00:22,630 --> 04:00:23,790
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.

5372
04:00:23,930 --> 04:00:26,210
Racist against demons, but not the insects.

5373
04:00:26,450 --> 04:00:27,390
That's what I was thinking too.

5374
04:00:44,420 --> 04:00:45,760
Hector, thank you for the super chat.

5375
04:00:45,840 --> 04:00:46,400
Thank you, thank you.

5376
04:00:46,440 --> 04:00:52,580
As someone who studied aviation maintenance, that airplane is a bit too chalky to be aerodynamically stable.

5377
04:00:52,960 --> 04:00:56,020
Those little wings can barely lift a damn thing.

5378
04:00:56,360 --> 04:00:58,080
Um, actually...

5379
04:01:00,400 --> 04:01:02,740
This is so exhilarating.

5380
04:01:02,940 --> 04:01:08,300
We have insect men right now, and you're here thinking, this plane should not be flying.

5381
04:01:12,940 --> 04:01:15,840
There's a little Death Star in the sky!

5382
04:01:16,600 --> 04:01:18,580
And you're worried about that?

5383
04:01:18,600 --> 04:01:19,320
This plane?

5384
04:01:20,520 --> 04:01:21,140
Hahahaha!

5385
04:01:22,800 --> 04:01:23,420
Hahahaha!

5386
04:01:25,560 --> 04:01:27,760
I mean, physics is physics.

5387
04:01:28,140 --> 04:01:30,860
Thank you, Hector.

5388
04:01:31,180 --> 04:01:31,800
Hahahaha!

5389
04:01:33,700 --> 04:01:36,160
Oh yeah, explain bees!

5390
04:01:52,640 --> 04:01:54,120
Oh yeah, we have rockets!

5391
04:02:00,320 --> 04:02:01,220
That's pretty good.

5392
04:02:01,240 --> 04:02:02,020
This guy's an angel.

5393
04:02:03,640 --> 04:02:06,420
Like, is there like, what, an angular angel?

5394
04:02:06,660 --> 04:02:08,080
Like, where are the other angels?

5395
04:02:08,180 --> 04:02:09,340
Where are the other angels that go?

5396
04:02:09,400 --> 04:02:11,820
Like, Muriel, it's time for bed!

5397
04:02:13,740 --> 04:02:14,360
Time's over!

5398
04:02:23,560 --> 04:02:23,960
Yeah,

5399
04:02:31,600 --> 04:02:33,760
where are the angels to spank this Brad?

5400
04:02:33,760 --> 04:02:35,960
General Array, heavy fire incoming!

5401
04:02:36,500 --> 04:02:37,220
What?

5402
04:02:37,760 --> 04:02:39,220
All troops, evacuate!

5403
04:02:49,130 --> 04:02:51,050
Sorry, traffic jam.

5404
04:02:51,410 --> 04:02:51,830
Hahaha!

5405
04:02:52,090 --> 04:02:55,050
We have a traffic jam!

5406
04:02:57,010 --> 04:03:00,410
Thank you for trusting your back to an enemy, General.

5407
04:03:03,670 --> 04:03:04,390
Oh!

5408
04:03:06,390 --> 04:03:08,090
Is he gonna die now?

5409
04:03:08,670 --> 04:03:09,350
What the?

5410
04:03:20,220 --> 04:03:22,300
Those suckers, they cannot see that.

5411
04:03:22,540 --> 04:03:22,980
Well, well.

5412
04:03:23,620 --> 04:03:26,060
Looks like someone is trying to play hero.

5413
04:03:27,640 --> 04:03:28,580
Supreme Commander!

5414
04:03:29,620 --> 04:03:30,360
Someone's there!

5415
04:03:31,280 --> 04:03:32,400
It's Rosetta!

5416
04:03:33,340 --> 04:03:34,180
What is she?

5417
04:03:35,020 --> 04:03:35,580
Abort!

5418
04:03:35,760 --> 04:03:36,700
Cease fire now!

5419
04:03:37,280 --> 04:03:38,280
It's too late!

5420
04:03:38,480 --> 04:03:40,460
We can't stop it from firing now!

5421
04:03:40,700 --> 04:03:41,580
Oh, that's awkward.

5422
04:03:46,450 --> 04:03:47,770
Oh, aim up!

5423
04:03:47,850 --> 04:03:48,190
Aim up!

5424
04:03:48,270 --> 04:03:48,390
Oh, that's awkward.

5425
04:03:49,590 --> 04:03:50,450
Aim up!

5426
04:03:50,470 --> 04:03:51,190
Where is he gonna hit now?

5427
04:03:52,510 --> 04:03:52,910
Oh!

5428
04:03:55,350 --> 04:03:55,990
Damn!

5429
04:03:56,450 --> 04:03:58,090
Fuck the animals that live there!

5430
04:03:58,490 --> 04:03:59,730
So it missed us.

5431
04:04:02,810 --> 04:04:04,990
That would suck if anyone lived there.

5432
04:04:05,350 --> 04:04:07,190
I knew that you would.

5433
04:04:08,570 --> 04:04:09,810
I knew that you would.

5434
04:04:09,810 --> 04:04:10,290
What were you?

5435
04:04:11,510 --> 04:04:13,710
He blew out the speedo.

5436
04:04:13,850 --> 04:04:13,970
He blew out the speedo.

5437
04:04:16,010 --> 04:04:18,390
Rest in please, Cliff Lass.

5438
04:04:23,190 --> 04:04:24,470
It's not over yet.

5439
04:04:25,930 --> 04:04:27,830
We need to keep the diversion going.

5440
04:04:29,910 --> 04:04:32,590
Beelzebub and the others should be en route to Garim as we speak.

5441
04:04:37,390 --> 04:04:37,910
Beelzebub and the others should be en route to Garim as we speak.

5442
04:04:37,910 --> 04:04:37,990
Beelzebub and the others should be en route to Garim as we speak.

5443
04:04:42,510 --> 04:04:44,570
Can we really be mad at that?

5444
04:04:45,090 --> 04:04:46,830
Our sensors are picking up something.

5445
04:04:47,010 --> 04:04:48,130
It's thermal signature.

5446
04:04:48,430 --> 04:04:50,650
It matches that of our own high speed plane!

5447
04:04:50,970 --> 04:04:52,150
Our one singular plane!

5448
04:04:53,250 --> 04:04:55,090
The resistance must have been the same.

5449
04:04:55,110 --> 04:04:55,910
We have hijacked it!

5450
04:04:57,750 --> 04:04:58,150
Quick!

5451
04:04:59,190 --> 04:05:00,210
Turn this thing around!

5452
04:05:01,270 --> 04:05:02,890
We're going to swat this fly!

5453
04:05:06,430 --> 04:05:07,410
We got spotted.

5454
04:05:08,490 --> 04:05:10,410
They'll shoot us full of holes in no time!

5455
04:05:10,470 --> 04:05:11,910
No shit, we got spotted?

5456
04:05:11,910 --> 04:05:12,430
Let's move altitude, Prince!

5457
04:05:22,630 --> 04:05:23,550
Maintain this altitude!

5458
04:05:23,930 --> 04:05:25,810
And get it as close as you can to Garim!

5459
04:05:25,810 --> 04:05:26,310
Oh, thank god.

5460
04:05:26,350 --> 04:05:27,450
I just have to go up and down.

5461
04:05:29,430 --> 04:05:31,330
Oh, this is easy.

5462
04:05:31,330 --> 04:05:33,470
Oh, wait, did I hurt myself?

5463
04:05:33,670 --> 04:05:33,970
Sorry.

5464
04:05:34,110 --> 04:05:34,870
This is easy.

5465
04:05:35,970 --> 04:05:37,010
Okay, now...

5466
04:05:38,050 --> 04:05:39,690
Now it's easy, guys.

5467
04:05:39,830 --> 04:05:41,350
Guys, this is harder than it looks!

5468
04:05:41,630 --> 04:05:42,710
But, oh shit!

5469
04:05:42,890 --> 04:05:44,370
But to me it looks easy.

5470
04:05:44,810 --> 04:05:46,690
To me it's easy, guys.

5471
04:05:46,810 --> 04:05:47,430
Just saying.

5472
04:05:49,050 --> 04:05:49,570
Weee!

5473
04:05:51,210 --> 04:05:51,730
What?!

5474
04:05:51,730 --> 04:05:52,930
Why was there a hole?

5475
04:05:54,410 --> 04:05:54,930
Okay!

5476
04:05:55,070 --> 04:05:57,830
There should not be a hole if I can't go through it.

5477
04:05:58,870 --> 04:05:59,390
Alright.

5478
04:06:00,170 --> 04:06:01,030
There we go.

5479
04:06:01,330 --> 04:06:03,910
This is on you guys for putting me on the wheel.

5480
04:06:04,610 --> 04:06:06,210
You did not have to give me the wheel.

5481
04:06:13,180 --> 04:06:13,740
Oh.

5482
04:06:14,180 --> 04:06:16,280
Do I have guns?

5483
04:06:18,440 --> 04:06:19,000
How?

5484
04:06:19,700 --> 04:06:20,260
How?

5485
04:06:21,060 --> 04:06:21,360
How?

5486
04:06:21,940 --> 04:06:22,500
Whoa!

5487
04:06:23,640 --> 04:06:24,200
Whoa!

5488
04:06:27,040 --> 04:06:27,600
Whoa!

5489
04:06:28,100 --> 04:06:28,420
Whoa!

5490
04:06:29,780 --> 04:06:30,900
Just go...

5491
04:06:30,900 --> 04:06:35,240
Just go up and down.

5492
04:06:35,400 --> 04:06:35,960
That's how.

5493
04:06:36,060 --> 04:06:37,980
This is how you dodge.

5494
04:06:40,840 --> 04:06:41,400
Easy.

5495
04:06:42,600 --> 04:06:43,160
Wait!

5496
04:06:43,240 --> 04:06:44,580
That's more than one plane!

5497
04:06:44,940 --> 04:06:46,920
I thought they had one singular plane!

5498
04:06:49,020 --> 04:06:50,140
There's more?!

5499
04:06:50,140 --> 04:06:50,540
Alright.

5500
04:06:50,820 --> 04:06:51,920
It lied to me.

5501
04:06:57,380 --> 04:06:57,940
That's it.

5502
04:06:58,080 --> 04:06:58,660
Right ahead.

5503
04:06:58,880 --> 04:07:00,080
Came straight for Gaara.

5504
04:07:00,240 --> 04:07:00,980
Oh my god.

5505
04:07:01,960 --> 04:07:03,360
I can't believe it.

5506
04:07:03,380 --> 04:07:04,800
There was more than one plane!

5507
04:07:05,240 --> 04:07:06,820
What the fuck is this?

5508
04:07:07,220 --> 04:07:08,940
What the fuck?!

5509
04:07:09,060 --> 04:07:10,060
How?!

5510
04:07:12,810 --> 04:07:14,330
Oh no!

5511
04:07:14,590 --> 04:07:15,090
No!

5512
04:07:16,790 --> 04:07:20,090
I did it!

5513
04:07:20,430 --> 04:07:24,030
I did it!

5514
04:07:24,030 --> 04:07:24,650
It's Toho.

5515
04:07:24,970 --> 04:07:25,310
No!

5516
04:07:25,410 --> 04:07:26,090
Toho!

5517
04:07:26,090 --> 04:07:27,150
My one weakness!

5518
04:07:28,370 --> 04:07:28,950
Toho!

5519
04:07:36,350 --> 04:07:38,090
Not Toho.

5520
04:07:47,550 --> 04:07:49,230
Oh god.

5521
04:07:49,410 --> 04:07:50,490
Oh god.

5522
04:07:50,710 --> 04:07:52,990
Oh, this is awkward.

5523
04:07:53,410 --> 04:07:55,230
No, not more trouble!

5524
04:07:56,450 --> 04:07:58,070
I can't see!

5525
04:08:01,030 --> 04:08:03,230
No, that one hit!

5526
04:08:03,390 --> 04:08:06,270
Oh my god, that's so bullshit!

5527
04:08:08,190 --> 04:08:10,550
I literally won it!

5528
04:08:11,450 --> 04:08:15,510
No I can do this all over again!

5529
04:08:16,790 --> 04:08:23,110
Okay guys, this time... I can figure this out.

5530
04:08:23,510 --> 04:08:28,010
Oh god, guys, I can figure this out.

5531
04:08:28,470 --> 04:08:35,410
Guys, see, I can do Touhou.

5532
04:08:35,590 --> 04:08:36,250
I can do Touhou.

5533
04:08:36,250 --> 04:08:36,250
I can do Touhou.

5534
04:08:36,250 --> 04:08:36,250
I can do Touhou.

5535
04:08:36,250 --> 04:08:36,890
I get 10 tries!

5536
04:08:37,130 --> 04:08:38,530
I get 10 tries!

5537
04:08:38,930 --> 04:08:39,210
Okay.

5538
04:08:39,570 --> 04:08:40,270
Alright.

5539
04:08:40,590 --> 04:08:41,250
No!

5540
04:08:41,750 --> 04:08:43,210
Okay, 8 tries!

5541
04:08:43,570 --> 04:08:44,550
8 tries!

5542
04:08:44,990 --> 04:08:49,830
8 tries, guys!

5543
04:08:50,330 --> 04:08:51,050
8 tries!

5544
04:08:52,550 --> 04:08:54,470
Okay, I think this is stereo.

5545
04:08:55,570 --> 04:08:56,590
We did it.

5546
04:08:58,410 --> 04:08:59,810
Insert credit.

5547
04:09:01,170 --> 04:09:03,590
Wait, what do I... what do I do?

5548
04:09:05,550 --> 04:09:08,090
What do I... what do I do?

5549
04:09:11,430 --> 04:09:11,910
What?

5550
04:09:12,490 --> 04:09:13,830
Oh, I did it.

5551
04:09:14,610 --> 04:09:16,070
I could... what?

5552
04:09:16,270 --> 04:09:18,690
I barely registered what I was supposed to do.

5553
04:09:25,540 --> 04:09:27,040
I didn't even know what I did.

5554
04:09:27,300 --> 04:09:27,920
Oh, okay.

5555
04:09:28,040 --> 04:09:29,260
Goodbye, singular plane.

5556
04:09:31,080 --> 04:09:33,300
That wasn't the only plane, apparently.

5557
04:09:33,420 --> 04:09:35,080
I accidentally did the QuickTime events.

5558
04:09:35,180 --> 04:09:35,680
I don't know how.

5559
04:09:35,880 --> 04:09:37,160
I thought we were dead.

5560
04:09:37,340 --> 04:09:37,820
I thought we were dead.

5561
04:09:39,560 --> 04:09:41,840
Madame Adon, prep me for this.

5562
04:09:43,440 --> 04:09:46,600
And how are we supposed to get off this contraption without a plane?

5563
04:09:47,460 --> 04:09:49,200
It's a whole flying fortress.

5564
04:09:49,540 --> 04:09:51,280
Surely there's some escape pods.

5565
04:09:52,260 --> 04:09:52,880
Basically.

5566
04:09:53,240 --> 04:09:55,800
We'll figure it all out later, don't worry.

5567
04:09:57,640 --> 04:09:59,340
So, let's get wrecked!

5568
04:09:59,380 --> 04:10:00,280
Goodbye, last plane.

5569
04:10:01,260 --> 04:10:03,140
The last plane in this army.

5570
04:10:05,580 --> 04:10:06,200
Hey!

5571
04:10:06,200 --> 04:10:07,500
What are you doing?

5572
04:10:09,260 --> 04:10:11,000
I'll handle this traitor myself.

5573
04:10:11,440 --> 04:10:13,300
I trust you have no objections.

5574
04:10:17,130 --> 04:10:17,670
Whoa.

5575
04:10:23,840 --> 04:10:25,120
That was close.

5576
04:10:25,560 --> 04:10:28,080
Hey, we gotta find the commander center.

5577
04:10:28,540 --> 04:10:29,420
It ends here.

5578
04:10:30,000 --> 04:10:31,200
Alright, we got this.

5579
04:10:31,300 --> 04:10:32,700
I believe in us, guys.

5580
04:10:32,920 --> 04:10:33,600
This is it.

5581
04:10:33,640 --> 04:10:34,120
Now!

5582
04:10:34,600 --> 04:10:37,700
Now, we're at the final part, guys.

5583
04:10:37,980 --> 04:10:38,680
This is it.

5584
04:10:38,920 --> 04:10:40,720
I know I said that an hour ago.

5585
04:10:40,900 --> 04:10:42,360
And two hours ago.

5586
04:10:42,460 --> 04:10:43,240
But this time!

5587
04:10:43,400 --> 04:10:44,940
This is the final area.

5588
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:46,020
For real.

5589
04:10:46,220 --> 04:10:48,840
This has to be the final area.

5590
04:10:50,980 --> 04:10:53,100
Now, we're at the final stage.

5591
04:10:55,640 --> 04:10:56,660
This is it.

5592
04:10:56,820 --> 04:10:57,620
For real.

5593
04:10:59,840 --> 04:11:00,900
For real, guys.

5594
04:11:01,100 --> 04:11:03,120
This has to be the final area.

5595
04:11:05,120 --> 04:11:05,680
Okay.

5596
04:11:05,820 --> 04:11:06,380
What?

5597
04:11:07,100 --> 04:11:07,860
I didn't hit that?

5598
04:11:08,160 --> 04:11:09,460
He, like, tanked it.

5599
04:11:11,520 --> 04:11:12,640
Holy shit.

5600
04:11:13,940 --> 04:11:15,640
That takes so much.

5601
04:11:17,980 --> 04:11:19,580
Come on, just let me shoot you once.

5602
04:11:19,640 --> 04:11:20,280
There you go.

5603
04:11:22,280 --> 04:11:23,000
There you go.

5604
04:11:23,000 --> 04:11:23,280
Trust.

5605
04:11:23,500 --> 04:11:24,460
The final part.

5606
04:11:24,620 --> 04:11:25,460
Part 3.

5607
04:11:26,100 --> 04:11:26,800
Oh, god.

5608
04:11:26,980 --> 04:11:27,940
Tank is blocking.

5609
04:11:29,380 --> 04:11:30,160
Here you go.

5610
04:11:33,380 --> 04:11:35,100
Holy shit, that's a lot of mechas.

5611
04:11:35,600 --> 04:11:37,980
But can't we only have, like, one plane?

5612
04:11:46,160 --> 04:11:46,680
Jesus.

5613
04:11:47,540 --> 04:11:48,060
Yeah.

5614
04:11:48,060 --> 04:11:48,180
Yeah.

5615
04:11:48,980 --> 04:11:49,460
Whoa!

5616
04:11:51,500 --> 04:11:52,620
Don't worry, I got you.

5617
04:11:53,120 --> 04:11:54,340
I'm gonna shoot through this hole.

5618
04:12:02,440 --> 04:12:03,740
Did I do it?

5619
04:12:05,180 --> 04:12:06,360
I did it.

5620
04:12:06,580 --> 04:12:07,060
Yeah!

5621
04:12:15,760 --> 04:12:16,800
No, the bridge!

5622
04:12:20,920 --> 04:12:22,120
Where'd I fucking go?

5623
04:12:22,700 --> 04:12:23,700
Oh, do I have to go this way?

5624
04:12:23,780 --> 04:12:24,720
No, it's 2D time.

5625
04:12:25,000 --> 04:12:26,320
That's a lot of people.

5626
04:12:26,320 --> 04:12:27,360
Holy shit.

5627
04:12:27,440 --> 04:12:30,060
It breaks that, but not the other bridge?

5628
04:12:31,480 --> 04:12:32,900
Alright, it's time.

5629
04:12:34,260 --> 04:12:35,480
That's fucking right.

5630
04:12:39,760 --> 04:12:41,020
That's fucking right.

5631
04:12:42,200 --> 04:12:43,460
You think I'm scared?

5632
04:12:43,800 --> 04:12:45,860
I will bring this tank up there.

5633
04:12:46,320 --> 04:12:48,260
I'm gonna bring this tank up there!

5634
04:12:48,320 --> 04:12:49,360
That's fucking right!

5635
04:12:50,680 --> 04:12:54,400
You think stairs is gonna fucking stop me?

5636
04:12:56,760 --> 04:12:58,300
I'm gonna bring this tank up there!

5637
04:12:58,300 --> 04:12:59,560
That's right.

5638
04:13:00,100 --> 04:13:02,320
Stairs are not gonna stop me!

5639
04:13:03,800 --> 04:13:06,760
I'll walk up the stairs and bring my tank over.

5640
04:13:08,600 --> 04:13:09,680
Wait, what's this?

5641
04:13:09,780 --> 04:13:10,340
This is yellow.

5642
04:13:11,340 --> 04:13:11,940
Loot.

5643
04:13:13,880 --> 04:13:14,480
Alright.

5644
04:13:15,140 --> 04:13:17,020
Sorry, I got sidetracked by loot.

5645
04:13:17,360 --> 04:13:18,300
Oh, shit!

5646
04:13:18,440 --> 04:13:19,320
Forest land officer.

5647
04:13:20,600 --> 04:13:22,300
Who brings a tank?

5648
04:13:22,460 --> 04:13:24,280
I bring a tank!

5649
04:13:25,020 --> 04:13:25,620
Whoa!

5650
04:13:28,360 --> 04:13:29,900
This guy brought a tank too!

5651
04:13:34,660 --> 04:13:35,380
Oh, shit!

5652
04:13:35,660 --> 04:13:36,160
He hit me!

5653
04:13:36,340 --> 04:13:36,920
I'm flipping!

5654
04:13:37,360 --> 04:13:37,720
Run!

5655
04:13:40,920 --> 04:13:41,280
Nice.

5656
04:13:41,280 --> 04:13:41,980
Okay, that's good.

5657
04:13:42,140 --> 04:13:43,100
Yeah, beat up the old man.

5658
04:13:43,180 --> 04:13:43,740
Don't beat up me.

5659
04:13:45,300 --> 04:13:45,660
Nice.

5660
04:13:45,660 --> 04:13:46,260
We have distraction.

5661
04:13:46,700 --> 04:13:47,260
Oh, wait!

5662
04:13:47,340 --> 04:13:47,940
I can do this!

5663
04:13:50,340 --> 04:13:50,700
Nice!

5664
04:13:52,780 --> 04:13:53,640
Nice, we did it.

5665
04:13:54,420 --> 04:13:54,780
Nice.

5666
04:13:54,780 --> 04:13:55,140
We did it.

5667
04:13:55,240 --> 04:13:55,600
Nice.

5668
04:13:55,600 --> 04:13:56,000
Yeah!

5669
04:13:58,600 --> 04:13:59,020
Alright.

5670
04:13:59,900 --> 04:14:00,960
Now where do we go?

5671
04:14:01,980 --> 04:14:02,660
Oh, this way.

5672
04:14:09,730 --> 04:14:10,990
Where am I supposed to shoot?

5673
04:14:13,170 --> 04:14:14,910
Oh, this has to be foreshadowing.

5674
04:14:15,930 --> 04:14:18,410
Cause like, where am I supposed to shoot for this?

5675
04:14:19,550 --> 04:14:21,710
That's a foreshadow for something, I'm pretty sure.

5676
04:14:24,530 --> 04:14:26,710
I must have to do that late at another time.

5677
04:14:27,170 --> 04:14:27,590
Woo!

5678
04:14:30,130 --> 04:14:30,850
Woo!

5679
04:14:31,030 --> 04:14:31,350
Woo!

5680
04:14:32,290 --> 04:14:33,610
It's okay I can run faster.

5681
04:14:35,790 --> 04:14:39,070
What do you mean, I have to place?!

5682
04:14:39,070 --> 04:14:39,730
No!

5683
04:14:46,410 --> 04:14:47,810
Oh my God!

5684
04:14:48,230 --> 04:14:50,250
I have to use my head?

5685
04:14:52,990 --> 04:14:54,770
Oh my God!

5686
04:14:55,030 --> 04:14:57,130
I can't believe it!

5687
04:14:57,210 --> 04:14:58,190
I can't believe it!

5688
04:14:58,190 --> 04:14:59,190
I can't bring a tank!

5689
04:15:01,050 --> 04:15:02,310
That's so fucked up.

5690
04:15:03,090 --> 04:15:06,090
It wouldn't let me bring a tank to the fight.

5691
04:15:07,890 --> 04:15:08,410
What?

5692
04:15:08,410 --> 04:15:08,930
Oh.

5693
04:15:10,190 --> 04:15:10,710
Wait.

5694
04:15:10,710 --> 04:15:11,230
What?

5695
04:15:12,970 --> 04:15:14,430
Where am I supposed to go then?

5696
04:15:16,550 --> 04:15:18,090
Am I supposed to beat you up first?

5697
04:15:20,050 --> 04:15:20,830
Oh no!

5698
04:15:21,010 --> 04:15:21,650
It's okay.

5699
04:15:22,750 --> 04:15:24,810
Uh... Oh I have to press a button!

5700
04:15:28,710 --> 04:15:30,330
Alright, that makes a lot more sense.

5701
04:15:32,570 --> 04:15:34,230
Actually makes a lot of sense now.

5702
04:15:36,070 --> 04:15:36,890
This way.

5703
04:15:40,690 --> 04:15:41,490
Oh my god!

5704
04:15:41,530 --> 04:15:41,970
He's me!

5705
04:15:43,170 --> 04:15:43,990
He's me!

5706
04:15:44,170 --> 04:15:44,710
He knows!

5707
04:15:47,070 --> 04:15:47,590
Wait.

5708
04:15:47,610 --> 04:15:47,930
What?

5709
04:15:48,850 --> 04:15:49,590
Then what?

5710
04:15:51,050 --> 04:15:52,170
Ready button mash.

5711
04:15:53,430 --> 04:15:53,950
Huh?

5712
04:15:54,210 --> 04:15:54,710
Did I not...

5713
04:15:54,710 --> 04:15:56,110
Did I not do it?

5714
04:15:58,190 --> 04:15:58,350
Oh!

5715
04:15:58,350 --> 04:15:59,970
There's more than one!

5716
04:16:01,370 --> 04:16:01,730
Oh!

5717
04:16:04,510 --> 04:16:05,630
Did I do it?

5718
04:16:06,990 --> 04:16:08,130
I did it!

5719
04:16:09,350 --> 04:16:11,150
I figured it out!

5720
04:16:12,450 --> 04:16:13,770
Button mashing time!

5721
04:16:14,250 --> 04:16:14,590
No!

5722
04:16:16,790 --> 04:16:17,470
Guys.

5723
04:16:17,470 --> 04:16:18,330
It's okay.

5724
04:16:18,870 --> 04:16:21,010
There's a water bottle at the next stop.

5725
04:16:23,450 --> 04:16:24,810
I believe...

5726
04:16:24,810 --> 04:16:26,530
I can make it.

5727
04:16:28,290 --> 04:16:29,410
Oh there's loot too.

5728
04:16:31,050 --> 04:16:31,450
Nice.

5729
04:16:32,910 --> 04:16:33,310
Wait.

5730
04:16:33,330 --> 04:16:34,150
But where does this go?

5731
04:16:35,990 --> 04:16:36,390
Oh.

5732
04:16:36,410 --> 04:16:37,530
This is where we're supposed to go.

5733
04:16:37,610 --> 04:16:38,690
I didn't realize that door is locked.

5734
04:16:39,050 --> 04:16:39,290
Anyway.

5735
04:16:39,350 --> 04:16:40,890
This is where we're supposed to go.

5736
04:16:41,270 --> 04:16:41,650
Oh.

5737
04:16:41,650 --> 04:16:41,910
Oh.

5738
04:16:41,950 --> 04:16:42,150
Oh.

5739
04:16:42,150 --> 04:16:42,350
Oh.

5740
04:16:42,350 --> 04:16:42,610
Gosh.

5741
04:16:43,830 --> 04:16:44,630
Oh shit!

5742
04:16:45,590 --> 04:16:45,990
No!

5743
04:16:46,010 --> 04:16:46,770
I can't drink water!

5744
04:16:46,970 --> 04:16:47,370
Woo!

5745
04:16:48,850 --> 04:16:49,250
No!

5746
04:16:50,510 --> 04:16:50,910
Okay.

5747
04:16:50,970 --> 04:16:51,770
I have to use my arms.

5748
04:16:53,150 --> 04:16:53,550
Alright.

5749
04:16:53,650 --> 04:16:54,430
I used my arms.

5750
04:16:56,550 --> 04:16:57,030
Oh!

5751
04:16:57,130 --> 04:16:57,470
Thank God!

5752
04:16:57,490 --> 04:16:57,790
Water!

5753
04:16:59,430 --> 04:16:59,910
Oh!

5754
04:17:01,030 --> 04:17:01,510
Oh!

5755
04:17:01,530 --> 04:17:02,250
This is right in the world!

5756
04:17:05,570 --> 04:17:06,050
Oh!

5757
04:17:06,090 --> 04:17:06,470
I knew it!

5758
04:17:06,490 --> 04:17:08,010
I knew the backside would have loot!

5759
04:17:09,070 --> 04:17:10,270
I could feel it!

5760
04:17:11,450 --> 04:17:12,170
Oh my!

5761
04:17:12,170 --> 04:17:13,670
Now I can bring my tank!

5762
04:17:13,870 --> 04:17:14,570
That's right!

5763
04:17:15,190 --> 04:17:17,330
You guys thought it's over!

5764
04:17:18,410 --> 04:17:21,110
You guys thought you couldn't get over here!

5765
04:17:23,030 --> 04:17:24,330
I brought the tank back.

5766
04:17:24,390 --> 04:17:24,410
Oh!

5767
04:17:24,430 --> 04:17:25,690
I'm outside again?

5768
04:17:26,750 --> 04:17:27,270
Oh!

5769
04:17:27,370 --> 04:17:27,730
Is this it?

5770
04:17:27,890 --> 04:17:28,830
Is this what it's for?

5771
04:17:31,110 --> 04:17:31,630
Wait!

5772
04:17:31,650 --> 04:17:32,630
You brought me off the thing!

5773
04:17:33,970 --> 04:17:34,490
No!

5774
04:17:35,510 --> 04:17:36,350
Get over here!

5775
04:17:38,630 --> 04:17:39,470
Oh my God!

5776
04:17:39,570 --> 04:17:40,090
Stop!

5777
04:17:40,430 --> 04:17:41,830
He's walking back!

5778
04:17:41,950 --> 04:17:43,890
He's floating backwards so slow!

5779
04:17:46,510 --> 04:17:47,930
It's messing me up!

5780
04:17:50,850 --> 04:17:51,370
Nice!

5781
04:17:51,570 --> 04:17:52,550
My 3 XP!

5782
04:17:53,710 --> 04:17:54,410
That's what I'm talking about!

5783
04:17:54,430 --> 04:17:55,010
That's what I needed!

5784
04:17:55,610 --> 04:17:57,950
Is the aquarium causing this?

5785
04:17:58,190 --> 04:17:58,690
Okay.

5786
04:17:59,330 --> 04:18:00,970
Such a powerful energy source!

5787
04:18:01,230 --> 04:18:03,130
It could do so much good!

5788
04:18:03,230 --> 04:18:04,330
Put to better uses!

5789
04:18:06,010 --> 04:18:07,210
Oh my gosh!

5790
04:18:07,250 --> 04:18:07,410
One down!

5791
04:18:07,630 --> 04:18:10,910
We could have all the electricity and power in the world!

5792
04:18:12,030 --> 04:18:12,650
Is it here?

5793
04:18:13,230 --> 04:18:13,910
Oh!

5794
04:18:15,030 --> 04:18:16,390
Just fall straight down?

5795
04:18:16,830 --> 04:18:17,310
Ah!

5796
04:18:17,950 --> 04:18:18,630
Okay!

5797
04:18:19,810 --> 04:18:20,490
Alright!

5798
04:18:20,790 --> 04:18:21,390
I'm okay!

5799
04:18:22,670 --> 04:18:24,370
At least it being 2D!

5800
04:18:24,370 --> 04:18:24,410
I'm not going to die!

5801
04:18:24,430 --> 04:18:24,530
2D!

5802
04:18:24,530 --> 04:18:26,010
It's easier to destroy these bots!

5803
04:18:27,550 --> 04:18:28,110
Alright!

5804
04:18:28,190 --> 04:18:28,490
Nice!

5805
04:18:29,130 --> 04:18:30,630
There's so much electricity!

5806
04:18:31,750 --> 04:18:32,850
Electricity fields here!

5807
04:18:34,590 --> 04:18:35,150
Goodbye!

5808
04:18:36,350 --> 04:18:36,910
Oh!

5809
04:18:37,010 --> 04:18:37,550
I almost...

5810
04:18:37,550 --> 04:18:38,950
I thought I couldn't get that!

5811
04:18:39,350 --> 04:18:39,910
Alright!

5812
04:18:39,930 --> 04:18:40,490
Down I go!

5813
04:18:41,250 --> 04:18:42,170
Down I go!

5814
04:18:43,930 --> 04:18:44,490
Yay!

5815
04:18:46,150 --> 04:18:46,710
Ooh!

5816
04:18:46,870 --> 04:18:47,510
Tank time!

5817
04:18:49,230 --> 04:18:49,790
Alright!

5818
04:18:51,230 --> 04:18:52,270
What the fuck?

5819
04:18:52,990 --> 04:18:54,410
Are these guys trying to do something?

5820
04:18:54,430 --> 04:18:56,450
This is not your fight!

5821
04:18:58,170 --> 04:18:58,570
Oh!

5822
04:18:58,810 --> 04:18:59,170
Fuck!

5823
04:18:59,250 --> 04:18:59,450
Okay!

5824
04:18:59,670 --> 04:19:00,070
Uh...

5825
04:19:01,210 --> 04:19:01,950
Did I do it?

5826
04:19:02,050 --> 04:19:02,550
Did I hit them?

5827
04:19:02,670 --> 04:19:03,250
I did.

5828
04:19:03,390 --> 04:19:03,730
Okay.

5829
04:19:03,790 --> 04:19:04,010
Nice!

5830
04:19:06,210 --> 04:19:06,610
Okay.

5831
04:19:06,610 --> 04:19:07,190
Get away!

5832
04:19:08,170 --> 04:19:09,290
This is not your fight!

5833
04:19:09,370 --> 04:19:09,710
Leave!

5834
04:19:10,610 --> 04:19:12,030
This is a tank fight!

5835
04:19:13,150 --> 04:19:14,210
You're not a tank!

5836
04:19:15,650 --> 04:19:16,050
Alright!

5837
04:19:16,070 --> 04:19:16,870
Down I go!

5838
04:19:18,290 --> 04:19:18,690
God!

5839
04:19:18,690 --> 04:19:19,670
There's so much protection!

5840
04:19:20,170 --> 04:19:21,870
Looks like I can get on and keep going!

5841
04:19:23,250 --> 04:19:23,650
Okay.

5842
04:19:24,010 --> 04:19:24,410
Alright!

5843
04:19:24,430 --> 04:19:25,190
And off we go!

5844
04:19:25,950 --> 04:19:26,510
Alright!

5845
04:19:30,060 --> 04:19:30,620
Loot!

5846
04:19:31,240 --> 04:19:31,800
Yay!

5847
04:19:31,960 --> 04:19:32,380
Loot!

5848
04:19:32,880 --> 04:19:36,420
Loot that I'm not gonna use because we're finally at the final part of the game!

5849
04:19:37,100 --> 04:19:38,800
There's no point in getting loot!

5850
04:19:39,840 --> 04:19:40,400
Post...

5851
04:19:40,400 --> 04:19:42,600
You guys know I'm not gonna do post-game, right?

5852
04:19:43,280 --> 04:19:45,740
But don't you think about the post-game!

5853
04:19:47,080 --> 04:19:48,420
The post-what?

5854
04:19:48,880 --> 04:19:52,380
A game that's finished when a game hits the credits!

5855
04:19:55,640 --> 04:19:56,200
Tanks?

5856
04:19:57,080 --> 04:19:58,080
Here we go!

5857
04:19:58,120 --> 04:20:00,180
They're coming after us with everything they've got!

5858
04:20:00,480 --> 04:20:02,180
Okay, we gotta make sure we repair!

5859
04:20:02,720 --> 04:20:03,780
We must be getting close!

5860
04:20:06,440 --> 04:20:07,360
Alright, nice!

5861
04:20:11,080 --> 04:20:11,640
Alright...

5862
04:20:11,640 --> 04:20:12,720
Oh, that's the officer!

5863
04:20:12,920 --> 04:20:13,240
Okay.

5864
04:20:15,560 --> 04:20:16,580
Oh, shit!

5865
04:20:16,780 --> 04:20:17,860
Oh my god!

5866
04:20:17,900 --> 04:20:19,480
What the fuck!

5867
04:20:20,560 --> 04:20:22,360
Oh, shit!

5868
04:20:22,360 --> 04:20:24,220
Holy shit!

5869
04:20:24,320 --> 04:20:25,620
That guy does so much damage!

5870
04:20:25,980 --> 04:20:27,120
Okay, okay.

5871
04:20:27,560 --> 04:20:28,720
We're just gonna do this!

5872
04:20:29,580 --> 04:20:32,880
Don't you think about the post-game loot!

5873
04:20:33,260 --> 04:20:35,120
Thank you for the Akasufa!

5874
04:20:35,220 --> 04:20:35,760
Thank you!

5875
04:20:35,800 --> 04:20:36,360
Thank you!

5876
04:20:36,380 --> 04:20:37,080
Thank you!

5877
04:20:39,640 --> 04:20:40,800
Jesus Christ!

5878
04:20:41,400 --> 04:20:43,820
That tank did so much damage!

5879
04:20:43,960 --> 04:20:44,940
Holy shit!

5880
04:20:47,380 --> 04:20:48,500
Goodbye, officer.

5881
04:20:49,900 --> 04:20:50,920
Oh, this way.

5882
04:20:51,080 --> 04:20:51,500
Oh, okay.

5883
04:20:51,700 --> 04:20:51,880
Oh, shit.

5884
04:20:51,880 --> 04:20:51,900
Oh, shit!

5885
04:20:51,900 --> 04:20:51,940
Oh, shit!

5886
04:20:51,940 --> 04:20:51,960
Oh, shit!

5887
04:20:52,900 --> 04:20:54,280
Thank you Super Chat!

5888
04:20:54,400 --> 04:20:54,600
Thank you!

5889
04:20:57,300 --> 04:20:58,740
Oh my god!

5890
04:20:58,860 --> 04:20:59,960
The tiny insect men!

5891
04:21:00,780 --> 04:21:05,280
Okay, after giving me tanks to fight, they're gonna send these guys over?

5892
04:21:06,020 --> 04:21:07,020
That's just...

5893
04:21:07,920 --> 04:21:09,620
How much damage are you gonna do?

5894
04:21:09,920 --> 04:21:12,480
Yeah, I thought so.

5895
04:21:15,540 --> 04:21:16,420
That's embarrassing.

5896
04:21:18,680 --> 04:21:20,160
That's embarrassing there.

5897
04:21:22,200 --> 04:21:23,120
There you go.

5898
04:21:24,400 --> 04:21:25,580
I'm gonna go this way.

5899
04:21:30,300 --> 04:21:32,080
It's like Ashley swatting flies.

5900
04:21:34,600 --> 04:21:35,660
Oh my god.

5901
04:21:36,180 --> 04:21:36,980
You know what?

5902
04:21:37,100 --> 04:21:40,360
I know you're just chilling, but like, fuck you too.

5903
04:21:41,200 --> 04:21:42,920
He's like, what did I do?

5904
04:21:44,200 --> 04:21:46,200
I was just taking in the scenery.

5905
04:21:48,920 --> 04:21:49,640
Any more?

5906
04:21:50,780 --> 04:21:51,480
No more?

5907
04:21:51,680 --> 04:21:51,840
Yeah.

5908
04:21:51,960 --> 04:21:52,640
I thought so.

5909
04:21:53,260 --> 04:21:53,860
Oh!

5910
04:21:54,100 --> 04:21:54,620
Wait!

5911
04:21:54,700 --> 04:21:55,180
That's you!

5912
04:21:56,520 --> 04:21:57,700
Dragon Ball Bot!

5913
04:21:59,140 --> 04:22:00,900
Not fast enough though.

5914
04:22:04,540 --> 04:22:05,960
Couldn't use your knife.

5915
04:22:07,260 --> 04:22:08,400
That's fucking right.

5916
04:22:10,660 --> 04:22:11,980
Is there another one?

5917
04:22:13,660 --> 04:22:14,960
Oh shit, there was.

5918
04:22:15,780 --> 04:22:17,320
Wait, he's level 24.

5919
04:22:17,340 --> 04:22:18,380
That's not fair.

5920
04:22:19,160 --> 04:22:21,640
I can only be level 20 because it's...

5921
04:22:21,640 --> 04:22:22,740
Post game shit.

5922
04:22:23,200 --> 04:22:25,860
Post game shit.

5923
04:22:26,280 --> 04:22:27,260
There you go.

5924
04:22:28,020 --> 04:22:28,720
There you go.

5925
04:22:28,720 --> 04:22:29,460
The 9 XP.

5926
04:22:29,980 --> 04:22:33,420
He's literally higher level than me and I still get 9 XP.

5927
04:22:34,660 --> 04:22:38,080
He brought a knife to a tank, but I know right.

5928
04:22:40,140 --> 04:22:41,100
That was easy.

5929
04:22:42,680 --> 04:22:43,280
Okay.

5930
04:22:46,280 --> 04:22:47,280
Is it working?

5931
04:22:47,280 --> 04:22:47,580
Is this working?

5932
04:22:49,960 --> 04:22:52,180
Is there supposed to be like a switch?

5933
04:22:53,060 --> 04:22:53,520
Oh!

5934
04:22:55,320 --> 04:22:56,200
No, there's loot.

5935
04:22:57,060 --> 04:22:59,320
Okay, let me grab the loot first.

5936
04:22:59,540 --> 04:23:00,700
That I definitely don't need.

5937
04:23:01,260 --> 04:23:03,060
How do I ride the elevator?

5938
04:23:04,960 --> 04:23:05,600
Elevator up?

5939
04:23:06,420 --> 04:23:07,180
Oh, okay.

5940
04:23:07,240 --> 04:23:07,800
I have to press Y.

5941
04:23:08,040 --> 04:23:10,940
That tiny little button there that told me to press Y.

5942
04:23:15,900 --> 04:23:16,940
Oh, we're almost there.

5943
04:23:17,780 --> 04:23:18,420
Twenty.

5944
04:23:18,440 --> 04:23:18,980
Ten.

5945
04:23:19,540 --> 04:23:20,800
Oh shit!

5946
04:23:20,920 --> 04:23:21,280
Okay.

5947
04:23:22,420 --> 04:23:23,060
Oh!

5948
04:23:24,920 --> 04:23:25,560
Oh!

5949
04:23:25,840 --> 04:23:27,280
Fucking what the fuck!

5950
04:23:28,020 --> 04:23:28,860
Oh my god!

5951
04:23:29,100 --> 04:23:30,740
Guys, he's putting me in the corner!

5952
04:23:31,060 --> 04:23:32,260
He's putting me in the corner!

5953
04:23:32,720 --> 04:23:33,260
Oh!

5954
04:23:33,540 --> 04:23:34,180
Fuck!

5955
04:23:42,450 --> 04:23:43,890
Holy shit!

5956
04:23:44,510 --> 04:23:47,750
Oh my god, it was like a gang fight!

5957
04:23:47,910 --> 04:23:48,950
Like what the...

5958
04:23:56,470 --> 04:23:58,250
Holy shit, that was...

5959
04:23:58,510 --> 04:24:00,990
Oh my god, that was...

5960
04:24:07,560 --> 04:24:08,700
Oh my god!

5961
04:24:08,760 --> 04:24:10,040
Get me out of here!

5962
04:24:10,180 --> 04:24:10,400
Oh!

5963
04:24:15,280 --> 04:24:16,880
Holy shit!

5964
04:24:17,680 --> 04:24:20,500
That was actually crazy!

5965
04:24:21,540 --> 04:24:24,000
How the fuck was that legal?

5966
04:24:27,440 --> 04:24:28,860
Oh my god.

5967
04:24:29,380 --> 04:24:32,220
That did not feel legal at all.

5968
04:24:34,540 --> 04:24:38,640
He actually like stuffed me into the corner of the room.

5969
04:24:38,880 --> 04:24:40,200
I've gotta be fucking mad.

5970
04:24:41,340 --> 04:24:43,140
We can't lose this fight.

5971
04:24:43,540 --> 04:24:45,260
Let's make sure that we're prepared.

5972
04:24:45,720 --> 04:24:46,100
Alright.

5973
04:24:46,360 --> 04:24:47,560
I think we're prepared.

5974
04:24:47,920 --> 04:24:49,260
I think that's really all.

5975
04:24:49,480 --> 04:24:53,420
I'm gonna wait until I get 100% guys on the laser.

5976
04:24:53,560 --> 04:24:56,940
I'm like 20... I'm gonna wait until I get 100% on the laser.

5977
04:24:57,180 --> 04:24:58,480
Gonna eat my sandwich.

5978
04:24:59,180 --> 04:25:00,560
Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

5979
04:25:00,620 --> 04:25:01,260
Thank you, thank you.

5980
04:25:01,260 --> 04:25:03,000
Bravestor Doki ran away.

5981
04:25:03,140 --> 04:25:04,500
She bravely ran away.

5982
04:25:04,680 --> 04:25:08,540
When danger reared its ugly head, she bravely turned her tail and...

5983
04:25:08,540 --> 04:25:10,180
It's not running away!

5984
04:25:10,360 --> 04:25:11,820
It's called tactical retreat!

5985
04:25:13,640 --> 04:25:14,940
People do it!

5986
04:25:22,980 --> 04:25:24,020
It's tactical!

5987
04:25:25,620 --> 04:25:27,640
Okay, I took a bite out of my sandwich.

5988
04:25:27,640 --> 04:25:28,040
I'm ready.

5989
04:25:29,900 --> 04:25:30,480
Okay.

5990
04:25:32,440 --> 04:25:33,520
Okay, let's see.

5991
04:25:33,620 --> 04:25:34,200
Okay.

5992
04:25:34,200 --> 04:25:34,380
Okay.

5993
04:25:34,380 --> 04:25:35,240
Reload, reload.

5994
04:25:35,600 --> 04:25:36,420
We're ready.

5995
04:25:38,200 --> 04:25:39,380
What the fuck?

5996
04:25:40,970 --> 04:25:41,740
Which one is it?

5997
04:25:41,800 --> 04:25:43,340
Oh, it's this guy again!

5998
04:25:43,940 --> 04:25:44,740
It's him!

5999
04:25:49,290 --> 04:25:49,640
Okay.

6000
04:25:51,220 --> 04:25:52,780
Okay, we can do this.

6001
04:25:55,180 --> 04:25:56,420
I... I...

6002
04:25:58,410 --> 04:25:58,760
Okay!

6003
04:25:59,060 --> 04:26:01,480
I realized lasers don't work!

6004
04:26:01,720 --> 04:26:03,020
I am...

6005
04:26:05,560 --> 04:26:09,040
I figured out lasers do not work on this guy!

6006
04:26:12,020 --> 04:26:14,680
Guys, it was close!

6007
04:26:15,560 --> 04:26:18,380
Guys, it was so close though!

6008
04:26:22,800 --> 04:26:25,180
It was so close!

6009
04:26:25,500 --> 04:26:28,760
Guys, it was bare... We almost hit it!

6010
04:26:31,300 --> 04:26:34,620
Jesus, how am I... Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking...

6011
04:26:35,860 --> 04:26:37,900
Trying to get rid of all of these first.

6012
04:26:38,800 --> 04:26:40,000
Holy shit!

6013
04:26:40,080 --> 04:26:40,300
Okay.

6014
04:26:45,790 --> 04:26:48,910
Oh yeah, I totally got this guy!

6015
04:26:49,210 --> 04:26:51,950
I totally do!

6016
04:26:53,130 --> 04:26:56,190
Okay, I'm just gonna use the explosive lasers...

6017
04:26:57,590 --> 04:27:01,710
On like... on like the things around me.

6018
04:27:01,990 --> 04:27:03,350
I feel like...

6019
04:27:04,210 --> 04:27:06,010
Okay, how did I miss?

6020
04:27:08,610 --> 04:27:09,130
Okay.

6021
04:27:09,810 --> 04:27:11,550
I'm gonna use it on these guys though.

6022
04:27:13,450 --> 04:27:13,970
Woo!

6023
04:27:15,930 --> 04:27:16,450
Woo!

6024
04:27:19,540 --> 04:27:20,360
Do I?

6025
04:27:22,800 --> 04:27:24,300
Okay, fuck you guys though!

6026
04:27:24,380 --> 04:27:25,720
You guys... you guys need to...

6027
04:27:25,720 --> 04:27:27,340
You guys need to leave.

6028
04:27:27,600 --> 04:27:29,160
You guys actually need to leave.

6029
04:27:30,580 --> 04:27:31,480
Oh god.

6030
04:27:35,320 --> 04:27:35,840
Run!

6031
04:27:36,100 --> 04:27:37,280
Do your thing, run!

6032
04:27:39,200 --> 04:27:39,460
Run!

6033
04:27:39,920 --> 04:27:40,440
Run!

6034
04:27:42,520 --> 04:27:44,160
God, he's so tanky!

6035
04:27:50,280 --> 04:27:52,140
Oh, he's almost down!

6036
04:27:52,220 --> 04:27:52,820
He's almost down!

6037
04:27:54,900 --> 04:27:55,420
No!

6038
04:28:01,990 --> 04:28:03,770
It's fine, it's just...

6039
04:28:03,770 --> 04:28:05,010
It's just...

6040
04:28:05,010 --> 04:28:05,930
Oh, it's not fine!

6041
04:28:07,550 --> 04:28:09,930
Guys, it's not fine.

6042
04:28:10,870 --> 04:28:11,990
Oh, why am I...

6043
04:28:11,990 --> 04:28:13,950
Oh god, why did I drop down?

6044
04:28:14,030 --> 04:28:15,410
Why did I drop down?

6045
04:28:15,750 --> 04:28:16,270
No!

6046
04:28:19,030 --> 04:28:19,670
Oh god.

6047
04:28:19,770 --> 04:28:22,010
Bro, he's fucking pushing me down!

6048
04:28:22,870 --> 04:28:24,190
Nice, BL, keep going!

6049
04:28:25,310 --> 04:28:26,410
This is not fair.

6050
04:28:26,610 --> 04:28:28,070
This is actually not fair.

6051
04:28:29,330 --> 04:28:30,910
Get this guy away from me.

6052
04:28:30,950 --> 04:28:32,250
Get this guy away from me!

6053
04:28:35,430 --> 04:28:35,950
Okay.

6054
04:28:36,310 --> 04:28:38,030
Alright, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

6055
04:28:38,330 --> 04:28:39,530
Keep on the offensive!

6056
04:28:40,070 --> 04:28:40,950
Oh no!

6057
04:28:41,790 --> 04:28:42,830
Oh no!

6058
04:28:43,110 --> 04:28:44,230
Keep on the offensive!

6059
04:28:44,250 --> 04:28:46,570
I don't feel so good!

6060
04:28:49,010 --> 04:28:49,650
Shit!

6061
04:28:49,650 --> 04:28:49,990
Wait, wait!

6062
04:28:50,030 --> 04:28:50,470
This should work!

6063
04:28:50,530 --> 04:28:51,090
This should work now!

6064
04:28:51,250 --> 04:28:51,850
This should work!

6065
04:28:54,190 --> 04:28:55,150
Because we're here!

6066
04:28:56,350 --> 04:28:57,090
I st...

6067
04:28:57,090 --> 04:29:01,690
cry I still don't touch it!

6068
04:29:01,810 --> 04:29:04,330
How do I not touch it?!

6069
04:29:04,330 --> 04:29:08,430
I don't understand how do I not touch it?

6070
04:29:09,410 --> 04:29:10,690
Holy shit!

6071
04:29:11,750 --> 04:29:13,110
This is not fair!

6072
04:29:14,070 --> 04:29:15,510
This is not fair!

6073
04:29:15,510 --> 04:29:16,710
Okay, this is actually not fair.

6074
04:29:21,750 --> 04:29:22,850
Where is he?

6075
04:29:23,850 --> 04:29:24,830
Where is he?

6076
04:29:25,490 --> 04:29:26,710
One more hit!

6077
04:29:27,090 --> 04:29:28,290
One more hit!

6078
04:29:31,610 --> 04:29:32,210
No!

6079
04:29:32,290 --> 04:29:33,470
Step one more hit!

6080
04:29:34,910 --> 04:29:36,690
Oh, thank god it's over!

6081
04:29:39,030 --> 04:29:40,230
Oh, it's over!

6082
04:29:40,230 --> 04:29:40,270
It's over!

6083
04:29:43,430 --> 04:29:46,250
Okay, we gotta like fix some...

6084
04:29:46,250 --> 04:29:49,330
We gotta make sure we have enough repair kits here.

6085
04:29:49,610 --> 04:29:51,610
Alright, repair kit max.

6086
04:29:51,990 --> 04:29:53,230
Okay, we're gonna put that here.

6087
04:29:55,730 --> 04:29:57,590
Oh, we did it.

6088
04:29:58,090 --> 04:29:59,590
We fucking did it.

6089
04:30:01,790 --> 04:30:03,030
I got him!

6090
04:30:05,650 --> 04:30:07,230
Down the elevator I go!

6091
04:30:08,210 --> 04:30:10,130
Can't believe it, our lasers hit.

6092
04:30:10,230 --> 04:30:10,930
It didn't work!

6093
04:30:11,170 --> 04:30:12,950
I can't believe our laser didn't work.

6094
04:30:14,170 --> 04:30:16,050
Okay, loot that I don't...

6095
04:30:16,050 --> 04:30:16,970
Oh, repair kit, nice!

6096
04:30:17,990 --> 04:30:18,670
Oh, thank god!

6097
04:30:19,390 --> 04:30:20,850
We needed the repair kit.

6098
04:30:23,510 --> 04:30:24,490
Oh, and water!

6099
04:30:24,910 --> 04:30:26,310
We always need water!

6100
04:30:27,630 --> 04:30:29,510
Okay, apparently not now though.

6101
04:30:30,730 --> 04:30:31,330
Nice!

6102
04:30:32,890 --> 04:30:34,310
Fill up that water!

6103
04:30:36,130 --> 04:30:38,910
This looks like final boss area-ish.

6104
04:30:42,590 --> 04:30:43,170
Red?

6105
04:30:44,650 --> 04:30:47,090
I wasn't sure you'd make it here.

6106
04:30:51,120 --> 04:30:53,300
You getting the jitters now?

6107
04:30:55,380 --> 04:30:55,960
You getting the jitters now?

6108
04:30:55,960 --> 04:30:56,760
Do I look scared?

6109
04:30:58,320 --> 04:30:59,220
Guess not.

6110
04:30:59,560 --> 04:31:02,860
I was like, you didn't quick travel the sock up for- Oh, nevermind.

6111
04:31:03,420 --> 04:31:04,000
Red!

6112
04:31:06,720 --> 04:31:09,380
Okay, he's not final boss cause we have to fight Muriel.

6113
04:31:09,640 --> 04:31:09,980
Don't bother him.

6114
04:31:10,320 --> 04:31:11,720
He's like second final boss.

6115
04:31:11,720 --> 04:31:14,600
But, I made a promise to Rosetta!

6116
04:31:15,980 --> 04:31:18,400
He's not gonna have a change of heart.

6117
04:31:18,660 --> 04:31:20,120
Gotta strike him down.

6118
04:31:21,500 --> 04:31:23,840
It seems you understand me well.

6119
04:31:26,020 --> 04:31:27,260
I don't need to.

6120
04:31:27,340 --> 04:31:28,720
You can't change him!

6121
04:31:28,980 --> 04:31:30,960
He grew up in the old times!

6122
04:31:30,960 --> 04:31:34,180
Where people hated fiends!

6123
04:31:41,470 --> 04:31:44,230
It must be because I lost him long ago.

6124
04:31:44,430 --> 04:31:44,690
What?

6125
04:31:46,470 --> 04:31:47,390
Nothing matters!

6126
04:31:47,410 --> 04:31:48,330
Nothing matters to me anymore.

6127
04:31:49,210 --> 04:31:49,730
Nothing!

6128
04:31:50,070 --> 04:31:52,430
Except my country, Forestland.

6129
04:31:53,130 --> 04:31:56,890
And I swear, I will exterminate any threat!

6130
04:31:57,310 --> 04:31:58,190
Oh shit!

6131
04:31:58,610 --> 04:32:00,310
Be it Sandland or Fiendkind!

6132
04:32:03,370 --> 04:32:05,190
Oh my god, he doesn't have a heart!

6133
04:32:06,890 --> 04:32:07,410
Wait!

6134
04:32:08,170 --> 04:32:09,230
Wait a minute!

6135
04:32:10,430 --> 04:32:11,990
Okay, thank god!

6136
04:32:12,050 --> 04:32:13,610
I was gonna say- Oh, this is bad!

6137
04:32:15,350 --> 04:32:15,850
Hahahahaha!

6138
04:32:19,370 --> 04:32:22,870
I was gonna say, it's bad that- like...

6139
04:32:22,870 --> 04:32:23,990
OH MY GOD!

6140
04:32:29,070 --> 04:32:33,610
I was gonna say this is awkward- if it was the mech fight because we did not upgrade the mech.

6141
04:32:33,670 --> 04:32:34,130
We...

6142
04:32:34,130 --> 04:32:39,650
We- OH SHIT!

6143
04:32:39,650 --> 04:32:40,670
WE SHOULD HAVE UPGRADED THE MECH!

6144
04:32:40,770 --> 04:32:42,630
We should've upgraded the mech, guys!

6145
04:32:47,510 --> 04:32:53,310
Guys, I would bring the mech out if the mech had any upgrades.

6146
04:32:55,810 --> 04:33:01,230
But unfortunately, I put all in on the tank.

6147
04:33:03,630 --> 04:33:05,390
I went all in.

6148
04:33:05,670 --> 04:33:07,830
I went all in, guys.

6149
04:33:12,330 --> 04:33:13,170
It's fine.

6150
04:33:13,270 --> 04:33:16,610
We just need to wait until... Holy shit.

6151
04:33:21,350 --> 04:33:23,030
Oh my god.

6152
04:33:25,050 --> 04:33:28,230
I am trying my best, thief!

6153
04:33:30,630 --> 04:33:31,310
Okay.

6154
04:33:31,310 --> 04:33:32,550
We have nitro.

6155
04:33:33,310 --> 04:33:34,850
We have to reload though.

6156
04:33:36,590 --> 04:33:37,270
Woo!

6157
04:33:41,030 --> 04:33:42,550
Honestly, yeah.

6158
04:33:42,570 --> 04:33:43,010
You should.

6159
04:33:43,130 --> 04:33:44,330
I'm actually doing really well.

6160
04:33:44,510 --> 04:33:46,570
Okay, he missed.

6161
04:33:46,630 --> 04:33:46,850
Nice.

6162
04:33:48,830 --> 04:33:49,430
No.

6163
04:33:49,430 --> 04:33:50,030
No.

6164
04:33:50,070 --> 04:33:50,410
Okay.

6165
04:33:51,230 --> 04:33:51,830
No!

6166
04:34:00,830 --> 04:34:02,630
It's actually not fair.

6167
04:34:03,090 --> 04:34:05,550
It's actually not fair.

6168
04:34:06,210 --> 04:34:08,150
He just jumped.

6169
04:34:09,150 --> 04:34:11,130
This is not a jump, boy!

6170
04:34:12,450 --> 04:34:13,050
Oh.

6171
04:34:14,670 --> 04:34:15,530
Oh my god.

6172
04:34:15,530 --> 04:34:16,490
He can jump.

6173
04:34:17,890 --> 04:34:19,230
That's so messed up.

6174
04:34:20,630 --> 04:34:22,250
He can do a lot apparently.

6175
04:34:25,070 --> 04:34:26,090
Oh my god.

6176
04:34:26,090 --> 04:34:27,150
He's almost done.

6177
04:34:29,330 --> 04:34:29,850
Okay.

6178
04:34:30,710 --> 04:34:31,790
We're so close.

6179
04:34:32,090 --> 04:34:32,370
No!

6180
04:34:32,530 --> 04:34:34,090
I can't get away from that!

6181
04:34:35,690 --> 04:34:36,210
Okay.

6182
04:34:36,430 --> 04:34:36,930
We're fine.

6183
04:34:36,990 --> 04:34:38,050
So we don't need to use it yet.

6184
04:34:40,090 --> 04:34:40,610
Alright.

6185
04:34:41,730 --> 04:34:43,110
Several more hits left.

6186
04:34:43,110 --> 04:34:43,930
Woo!

6187
04:34:44,970 --> 04:34:46,750
What the fuck!

6188
04:34:47,050 --> 04:34:48,170
No, no, no, no, no!

6189
04:34:49,110 --> 04:34:50,910
I was so close!

6190
04:34:50,950 --> 04:34:51,770
That was so close!

6191
04:34:51,830 --> 04:34:53,590
That was actually so close!

6192
04:34:54,850 --> 04:34:56,670
Oh, I would have been...

6193
04:34:56,670 --> 04:34:58,670
Oh my god!

6194
04:35:00,730 --> 04:35:02,050
Oh no!

6195
04:35:02,830 --> 04:35:03,870
Oh no!

6196
04:35:03,990 --> 04:35:04,990
Oh no!

6197
04:35:05,430 --> 04:35:06,010
Oh no!

6198
04:35:07,670 --> 04:35:09,330
He's nearly won!

6199
04:35:09,530 --> 04:35:10,630
He's nearly won!

6200
04:35:10,630 --> 04:35:11,890
Oh my god!

6201
04:35:12,910 --> 04:35:15,410
That did like more than 50%!

6202
04:35:17,470 --> 04:35:18,230
Why?

6203
04:35:18,630 --> 04:35:24,370
I turned my heart to stone and shattered it to pieces all for my...

6204
04:35:24,370 --> 04:35:24,990
You have no heart?

6205
04:35:25,090 --> 04:35:25,690
How are you alive?

6206
04:35:26,310 --> 04:35:27,390
How cruel.

6207
04:35:27,910 --> 04:35:33,450
That now even my body will be smashed apart by this accursed fiend.

6208
04:35:35,650 --> 04:35:36,410
No.

6209
04:35:36,410 --> 04:35:43,900
Perhaps losing everything is exactly what I...

6210
04:35:43,900 --> 04:35:44,620
Nano Machines.

6211
04:35:45,940 --> 04:35:47,820
Can you stop with the pity party?

6212
04:35:49,260 --> 04:35:52,840
Fred, how exactly do you think we even made it this far?

6213
04:35:53,340 --> 04:35:54,600
It was Rosetta.

6214
04:35:54,780 --> 04:35:57,020
She told us where the airplane was.

6215
04:35:58,140 --> 04:36:01,120
So she betrayed military secrets to the enemy.

6216
04:36:02,660 --> 04:36:05,100
She was deeply conflicted over it.

6217
04:36:05,420 --> 04:36:08,120
But the reason she ultimately did it...

6218
04:36:08,120 --> 04:36:09,540
Was to stop you.

6219
04:36:10,520 --> 04:36:13,820
She wanted to save you from the self-destructive spiral.

6220
04:36:16,040 --> 04:36:17,660
That's what you call...

6221
04:36:17,660 --> 04:36:20,560
Standing in the way of Garum's cannon.

6222
04:36:21,200 --> 04:36:22,720
To protect the enemy.

6223
04:36:23,040 --> 04:36:25,140
Yeah, but you didn't kill her.

6224
04:36:25,240 --> 04:36:26,340
So you still have a heart.

6225
04:36:26,820 --> 04:36:27,920
That's what treachery... what is.

6226
04:36:29,440 --> 04:36:31,600
It was you she wanted to protect.

6227
04:36:31,860 --> 04:36:33,420
Not the Royal Army.

6228
04:36:36,460 --> 04:36:38,100
She was trying to stop you.

6229
04:36:38,100 --> 04:36:38,820
She wanted to save your soul.

6230
04:36:39,160 --> 04:36:41,040
She staked her life on it.

6231
04:36:43,240 --> 04:36:44,780
You're saying she...

6232
04:36:46,020 --> 04:36:48,520
That's what I choose to believe at least.

6233
04:36:48,960 --> 04:36:52,640
I can't claim to truly know the heart of another person.

6234
04:36:53,340 --> 04:36:56,620
Reading minds is fiends territory after all.

6235
04:36:57,600 --> 04:37:02,180
I know that Rosetta has so much she wants to tell you.

6236
04:37:02,320 --> 04:37:04,500
So please stop your war crimes.

6237
04:37:05,400 --> 04:37:07,280
But after all I've done...

6238
04:37:07,280 --> 04:37:09,640
How can I possibly face her now?

6239
04:37:10,080 --> 04:37:11,860
I mean you're both murderers.

6240
04:37:11,900 --> 04:37:13,100
It's not like one...

6241
04:37:13,100 --> 04:37:15,480
Like maybe one has killed more than the other.

6242
04:37:15,540 --> 04:37:16,660
But you still all killed civilians.

6243
04:37:17,760 --> 04:37:19,080
As her father.

6244
04:37:19,700 --> 04:37:22,100
So you're like on the equal... I guess you guys are equal.

6245
04:37:25,680 --> 04:37:28,700
Aren't there things you want to tell your father too, Chris?

6246
04:37:28,700 --> 04:37:29,060
Flick him.

6247
04:37:29,660 --> 04:37:30,980
War crime, please.

6248
04:37:31,480 --> 04:37:32,720
Just flick him, you're right.

6249
04:37:32,800 --> 04:37:33,440
Just flick him.

6250
04:37:33,720 --> 04:37:35,980
Let's go beat that angel and get this over with.

6251
04:37:49,030 --> 04:37:49,550
How is she doing?

6252
04:37:49,550 --> 04:37:53,670
The thing I'm very surprised by is that we forgive these two very easily for...

6253
04:37:53,670 --> 04:37:55,470
Like yes, they're now on our side.

6254
04:37:55,650 --> 04:37:56,210
But like...

6255
04:37:57,050 --> 04:37:58,370
They still murdered?

6256
04:37:58,970 --> 04:37:59,490
Like...

6257
04:38:02,190 --> 04:38:04,050
I'm pretty sure the wives...

6258
04:38:04,050 --> 04:38:08,930
that have told about how their husbands were great heroes will not appreciate that.

6259
04:38:10,050 --> 04:38:13,250
Surely a fiend is in no position to judge me for that.

6260
04:38:18,310 --> 04:38:19,410
Anime logic.

6261
04:38:21,270 --> 04:38:22,990
With the power of anime!

6262
04:38:23,750 --> 04:38:27,730
You shall be absolved of the thousands of people you murdered.

6263
04:38:29,650 --> 04:38:30,810
Because you're hot.

6264
04:38:35,430 --> 04:38:38,130
As long as you look good doing it.

6265
04:38:39,610 --> 04:38:41,550
Yeah, I mean we forgave Vegeta.

6266
04:38:42,490 --> 04:38:43,690
Very easily.

6267
04:38:44,090 --> 04:38:48,690
Because with the Dragon Balls we can wish them back to life.

6268
04:38:48,970 --> 04:38:51,150
So commit as much murder as you want!

6269
04:38:51,730 --> 04:38:53,550
We'll just wish them back to life!

6270
04:38:58,540 --> 04:39:00,060
Alright, let's see...

6271
04:39:05,440 --> 04:39:07,240
But Vegeta's a homie!

6272
04:39:10,020 --> 04:39:11,980
That's different, Doki.

6273
04:39:12,200 --> 04:39:13,480
He's a homie.

6274
04:39:13,500 --> 04:39:13,780
He's a homie.

6275
04:39:17,240 --> 04:39:18,920
Alright, let's see...

6276
04:39:20,400 --> 04:39:21,620
Alright, it's time.

6277
04:39:21,960 --> 04:39:23,100
It's time, Muriel.

6278
04:39:23,400 --> 04:39:23,940
Are you...

6279
04:39:24,340 --> 04:39:25,440
Put your jacket up!

6280
04:39:25,600 --> 04:39:26,840
What the fuck, Muriel!

6281
04:39:27,180 --> 04:39:27,840
Put a shirt!

6282
04:39:29,100 --> 04:39:30,140
It's cold!

6283
04:39:37,250 --> 04:39:38,690
Are those chicken wings?

6284
04:39:44,420 --> 04:39:50,000
What the fuck is that?

6285
04:39:50,000 --> 04:39:52,580
You put a shirt on!

6286
04:39:52,760 --> 04:39:55,600
Now it's not just about it being cold!

6287
04:39:55,820 --> 04:39:58,180
Now it's not just about you putting a shirt on!

6288
04:39:58,660 --> 04:40:00,080
Or rather it was.

6289
04:40:00,340 --> 04:40:02,080
Until the humans defiled it!

6290
04:40:02,700 --> 04:40:05,120
What the fuck is wrong with your back?

6291
04:40:05,580 --> 04:40:07,840
They fell further and further from grace.

6292
04:40:09,720 --> 04:40:11,360
Oh, he's a falling angel!

6293
04:40:11,880 --> 04:40:13,980
It is us angels duty to bring the humans back to the light.

6294
04:40:14,120 --> 04:40:16,760
And vanquish the demons responsible for...

6295
04:40:16,760 --> 04:40:18,300
I don't feel comfortable.

6296
04:40:21,100 --> 04:40:21,640
Hey!

6297
04:40:22,680 --> 04:40:25,020
I'm in the middle of a speech here!

6298
04:40:25,240 --> 04:40:26,940
Orange, welcome to Tomato...

6299
04:40:26,940 --> 04:40:29,840
I'm so concerned that you chose the chicken wings moment.

6300
04:40:30,140 --> 04:40:33,180
I just didn't fucking join the membership for welcome.

6301
04:40:34,000 --> 04:40:36,920
I shouldn't have expected any better from a fiend.

6302
04:40:37,320 --> 04:40:39,040
Lucifer was exactly the same.

6303
04:40:40,140 --> 04:40:42,220
He wouldn't listen to a single word.

6304
04:40:42,380 --> 04:40:45,300
Just tore off my beautiful wings as I begged him not to!

6305
04:40:45,400 --> 04:40:46,260
Oh, he did that!

6306
04:40:47,520 --> 04:40:49,980
I'm not surprised a rotten apple like this...

6307
04:40:49,980 --> 04:40:51,560
But I'm not surprised a rotten apple like you hasn't fallen far from the tree.

6308
04:40:53,420 --> 04:40:54,560
Like I care.

6309
04:40:54,880 --> 04:40:55,980
Enough talking.

6310
04:40:56,180 --> 04:40:57,180
Let's rumble!

6311
04:40:57,860 --> 04:40:59,060
You wanna fight?

6312
04:40:59,260 --> 04:41:00,060
You've got one.

6313
04:41:00,200 --> 04:41:02,200
Let's settle this with just our sticks.

6314
04:41:02,380 --> 04:41:02,420
Nooo!

6315
04:41:02,700 --> 04:41:03,860
Round three!

6316
04:41:04,260 --> 04:41:06,680
Time to see which one of us is stronger, one team for all!

6317
04:41:09,600 --> 04:41:11,000
You impudent brat!

6318
04:41:11,500 --> 04:41:15,320
I'll teach you just how much stronger angels are than fiends!

6319
04:41:19,980 --> 04:41:21,860
Just please let me get the cake!

6320
04:41:22,720 --> 04:41:23,040
Please!

6321
04:41:26,180 --> 04:41:27,860
This time for real!

6322
04:41:29,280 --> 04:41:29,920
NOOOOOO!

6323
04:41:30,760 --> 04:41:31,800
Bro, get over here!

6324
04:41:34,000 --> 04:41:35,720
Get over here!

6325
04:41:36,020 --> 04:41:38,900
Okay, let me... I bought strength serum for this.

6326
04:41:39,000 --> 04:41:42,140
I had a feeling I'm gonna have to do this.

6327
04:41:42,460 --> 04:41:44,460
Okay, and then health drink.

6328
04:41:44,780 --> 04:41:46,660
Alright, health drink will be here.

6329
04:41:47,820 --> 04:41:48,460
Uhh...

6330
04:41:48,980 --> 04:41:49,920
Health... Wait, that...

6331
04:41:49,980 --> 04:41:51,380
Wait, did I put the health drink on?

6332
04:41:51,680 --> 04:41:52,620
No, I didn't.

6333
04:41:53,320 --> 04:41:54,220
Put that here.

6334
04:41:54,680 --> 04:41:55,160
Alright.

6335
04:41:55,980 --> 04:41:57,020
Give me a sec.

6336
04:41:58,220 --> 04:41:59,440
Alright, now I'm strong!

6337
04:42:00,100 --> 04:42:00,980
Oh shit.

6338
04:42:01,280 --> 04:42:02,140
Get over here!

6339
04:42:02,440 --> 04:42:03,540
Now I'm strong!

6340
04:42:03,740 --> 04:42:04,620
Get over here!

6341
04:42:04,980 --> 04:42:06,760
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!

6342
04:42:07,080 --> 04:42:07,560
Child!

6343
04:42:10,580 --> 04:42:12,980
Get your chicken nugget wings in here!

6344
04:42:16,020 --> 04:42:16,820
Oh shit.

6345
04:42:19,980 --> 04:42:20,520
Oh shit.

6346
04:42:20,540 --> 04:42:21,300
I didn't see that.

6347
04:42:21,340 --> 04:42:21,920
That's not fair.

6348
04:42:22,960 --> 04:42:23,800
Here we go.

6349
04:42:23,820 --> 04:42:24,340
That's right.

6350
04:42:24,600 --> 04:42:26,300
Say that again to my face!

6351
04:42:28,560 --> 04:42:32,080
I ate some spinach!

6352
04:42:34,940 --> 04:42:36,540
That's fucking right, Mutia!

6353
04:42:36,840 --> 04:42:39,000
I got some spinach in my ass!

6354
04:42:39,740 --> 04:42:40,620
Oh my god, bubble!

6355
04:42:42,560 --> 04:42:43,600
Oh shit.

6356
04:42:46,460 --> 04:42:47,320
Oh shit.

6357
04:42:47,320 --> 04:42:48,100
No, not the bubble!

6358
04:42:48,160 --> 04:42:48,660
Not the bubble!

6359
04:42:48,780 --> 04:42:49,280
Not the bubble!

6360
04:42:49,460 --> 04:42:50,160
Not the bubble!

6361
04:42:53,180 --> 04:42:53,880
Oh shit!

6362
04:42:53,940 --> 04:42:54,500
Oh shit!

6363
04:42:56,740 --> 04:42:58,260
You can't turn around fast enough.

6364
04:42:58,320 --> 04:42:58,840
You're on a roller.

6365
04:43:03,560 --> 04:43:04,700
I learned, guys.

6366
04:43:13,300 --> 04:43:14,240
Look at yourself.

6367
04:43:18,200 --> 04:43:19,540
You're supposed to put in your first Oh shit.

6368
04:43:19,540 --> 04:43:19,820
mouth.

6369
04:43:19,820 --> 04:43:21,000
It's like...

6370
04:43:24,720 --> 04:43:31,340
Things end up... if you guys don't know, if you put things in the butt, it absorbs fasting.

6371
04:43:35,860 --> 04:43:39,240
If you guys didn't know about that...

6372
04:43:40,160 --> 04:43:41,460
I hate you.

6373
04:43:42,340 --> 04:43:43,380
You're the best, Bubba.

6374
04:43:43,540 --> 04:43:45,540
But you are indeed strong.

6375
04:43:46,560 --> 04:43:47,700
Thing is...

6376
04:43:52,840 --> 04:43:53,600
What?

6377
04:43:56,040 --> 04:43:57,920
Is he absorbing the equilibrium?

6378
04:43:58,440 --> 04:43:59,520
Oh my god!

6379
04:44:00,460 --> 04:44:01,920
He's oo-ing!

6380
04:44:13,440 --> 04:44:15,060
He's oo-ing out!

6381
04:44:16,460 --> 04:44:17,440
His oo-power!

6382
04:44:21,720 --> 04:44:22,720
Oo-woo.

6383
04:44:22,820 --> 04:44:24,700
Oo-woo overdrive!

6384
04:44:24,720 --> 04:44:25,500
Who's that in the bathroom?

6385
04:44:25,500 --> 04:44:27,800
That's right.

6386
04:44:38,460 --> 04:44:39,800
What the fuck?

6387
04:44:40,400 --> 04:44:41,600
Holy shit!

6388
04:44:41,860 --> 04:44:43,340
He has wings now!

6389
04:44:46,140 --> 04:44:48,260
Okay, but how do you know that?

6390
04:44:48,360 --> 04:44:50,320
I think it was super chat.

6391
04:44:50,960 --> 04:44:52,400
Alright, thank you, thank you.

6392
04:44:52,840 --> 04:44:54,000
Jesus Christ.

6393
04:45:03,820 --> 04:45:06,120
Thank fucking God!

6394
04:45:06,700 --> 04:45:09,380
Oh my God, thank you!

6395
04:45:10,360 --> 04:45:11,100
Whoa!

6396
04:45:12,300 --> 04:45:13,720
I was... what?

6397
04:45:13,920 --> 04:45:14,520
Jesus Christ!

6398
04:45:17,840 --> 04:45:18,800
Okay, wait.

6399
04:45:18,940 --> 04:45:19,640
There we go.

6400
04:45:20,680 --> 04:45:21,420
Yeah.

6401
04:45:21,840 --> 04:45:22,520
Yeah!

6402
04:45:22,780 --> 04:45:23,520
What?

6403
04:45:25,500 --> 04:45:25,980
Okay.

6404
04:45:25,980 --> 04:45:28,980
I didn't realize I did that little damage.

6405
04:45:29,640 --> 04:45:30,760
Oh, he's on me!

6406
04:45:30,780 --> 04:45:31,200
He's on me!

6407
04:45:31,200 --> 04:45:31,780
He's looking at me!

6408
04:45:31,860 --> 04:45:32,020
Oh!

6409
04:45:32,120 --> 04:45:33,000
He's looking at me!

6410
04:45:33,020 --> 04:45:34,220
I gotta repair just in case!

6411
04:45:38,200 --> 04:45:39,160
Okay, nice.

6412
04:45:41,280 --> 04:45:42,080
Thank God.

6413
04:45:42,480 --> 04:45:45,820
I can finally use my main power!

6414
04:45:48,400 --> 04:45:50,300
I do like... okay, 2000.

6415
04:45:50,540 --> 04:45:51,040
That's good.

6416
04:45:52,900 --> 04:45:54,480
What do you mean, this won't do?

6417
04:45:55,320 --> 04:45:57,220
I am trying my best!

6418
04:45:57,740 --> 04:46:00,360
I'm doing little poke damage right now!

6419
04:46:03,620 --> 04:46:05,160
What is his weakness?

6420
04:46:05,980 --> 04:46:07,280
Is it his butt?

6421
04:46:10,880 --> 04:46:13,040
Okay, nice.

6422
04:46:14,500 --> 04:46:15,960
Charging as max as I can!

6423
04:46:16,980 --> 04:46:17,880
Okay, 3000.

6424
04:46:17,880 --> 04:46:18,220
Okay, 3000.

6425
04:46:20,760 --> 04:46:21,700
Yeah, no shit.

6426
04:46:22,000 --> 04:46:24,240
You're not losing your nerve, are you?

6427
04:46:26,580 --> 04:46:28,100
What the fuck?

6428
04:46:29,500 --> 04:46:31,780
What the fuck?!

6429
04:46:34,540 --> 04:46:37,140
How did he get bigger?

6430
04:46:39,460 --> 04:46:40,640
Holy shit!

6431
04:46:41,760 --> 04:46:43,700
Oh my God, bro!

6432
04:46:44,040 --> 04:46:45,680
Someone stop beating him!

6433
04:46:49,940 --> 04:46:53,200
Who keeps beating this giant?!

6434
04:46:54,760 --> 04:46:56,760
Who keeps beating him?!

6435
04:47:02,520 --> 04:47:03,140
Oh God.

6436
04:47:03,380 --> 04:47:04,340
Oh God.

6437
04:47:06,680 --> 04:47:08,940
Someone... someone needs to stop.

6438
04:47:11,820 --> 04:47:12,840
Oh God.

6439
04:47:13,380 --> 04:47:14,580
Oh, thank God.

6440
04:47:16,600 --> 04:47:17,200
Okay.

6441
04:47:17,200 --> 04:47:18,260
We got him.

6442
04:47:18,460 --> 04:47:19,400
He's down.

6443
04:47:20,020 --> 04:47:21,400
He's down, guys!

6444
04:47:21,540 --> 04:47:22,140
He's down!

6445
04:47:28,720 --> 04:47:29,600
Oh no!

6446
04:47:29,900 --> 04:47:31,540
He can't get up!

6447
04:47:31,720 --> 04:47:32,840
He can't!

6448
04:47:32,840 --> 04:47:33,300
He's stuck!

6449
04:47:35,700 --> 04:47:37,320
Oh, thank God he's stuck.

6450
04:47:38,320 --> 04:47:39,600
Is he bugged?

6451
04:47:40,260 --> 04:47:41,940
Is he actually bugged?

6452
04:47:42,340 --> 04:47:43,700
Oh my God, damn it!

6453
04:47:46,280 --> 04:47:46,880
What?!

6454
04:47:46,880 --> 04:47:49,180
So easy!

6455
04:47:52,500 --> 04:47:56,860
The hardest boss fight of my life.

6456
04:47:58,080 --> 04:47:59,300
Wait, no!

6457
04:47:59,480 --> 04:48:00,420
He bugged himself!

6458
04:48:00,740 --> 04:48:01,080
No!

6459
04:48:03,960 --> 04:48:04,820
No!

6460
04:48:07,960 --> 04:48:10,880
Oh my God, what the fuck?!

6461
04:48:12,660 --> 04:48:14,000
He turned back!

6462
04:48:16,080 --> 04:48:17,420
How did he do it?!

6463
04:48:20,150 --> 04:48:21,570
Holy shit, he turned back!

6464
04:48:23,390 --> 04:48:24,290
Oh God.

6465
04:48:24,790 --> 04:48:26,410
Maybe I should have been up, but...

6466
04:48:26,410 --> 04:48:27,690
Maybe that would work.

6467
04:48:30,030 --> 04:48:30,510
Okay.

6468
04:48:30,790 --> 04:48:32,230
Is he transforming again?

6469
04:48:32,530 --> 04:48:34,710
Oh God, I'm gonna...

6470
04:48:34,710 --> 04:48:36,050
Uh... Max.

6471
04:48:37,190 --> 04:48:38,050
Okay, I'm gonna do this.

6472
04:48:39,730 --> 04:48:40,570
Oh, he's back!

6473
04:48:40,610 --> 04:48:41,030
He's back!

6474
04:48:41,410 --> 04:48:42,550
He's big boy again!

6475
04:48:44,070 --> 04:48:45,010
He's big boy!

6476
04:48:47,950 --> 04:48:48,390
Okay.

6477
04:48:48,390 --> 04:48:50,250
This is gonna take a couple of years.

6478
04:48:51,650 --> 04:48:52,450
Oh my God!

6479
04:48:52,490 --> 04:48:53,710
Is he bigger?!

6480
04:48:55,970 --> 04:48:57,270
Oh, he fell again!

6481
04:48:58,810 --> 04:48:59,770
He can't get up!

6482
04:49:00,050 --> 04:49:00,730
This is it!

6483
04:49:01,610 --> 04:49:02,390
Oh shit.

6484
04:49:03,010 --> 04:49:03,970
This is not fair.

6485
04:49:05,630 --> 04:49:06,590
Oh my God, no.

6486
04:49:06,630 --> 04:49:07,330
He's gonna go back.

6487
04:49:09,170 --> 04:49:10,830
Oh... Oh no!

6488
04:49:10,890 --> 04:49:11,310
No!

6489
04:49:12,090 --> 04:49:12,530
Oh, he's back!

6490
04:49:12,530 --> 04:49:13,490
I'm not fast enough!

6491
04:49:17,010 --> 04:49:19,210
Jesus Christ, he's so tanky!

6492
04:49:21,530 --> 04:49:22,930
Just shoot him in the dick!

6493
04:49:25,490 --> 04:49:26,010
Alright.

6494
04:49:27,030 --> 04:49:28,330
That's everybody's weakness!

6495
04:49:29,730 --> 04:49:31,890
It doesn't matter if you're an angel!

6496
04:49:32,230 --> 04:49:33,010
Oh no.

6497
04:49:33,430 --> 04:49:33,950
Okay.

6498
04:49:39,460 --> 04:49:39,980
Bam.

6499
04:49:39,980 --> 04:49:40,500
Alright.

6500
04:49:40,840 --> 04:49:42,220
Guys, we're almost there.

6501
04:49:42,240 --> 04:49:42,940
I can feel it!

6502
04:49:43,120 --> 04:49:43,320
No!

6503
04:49:43,320 --> 04:49:45,620
We've made it so far!

6504
04:49:48,140 --> 04:49:49,300
Ral, get in there!

6505
04:49:52,040 --> 04:49:53,540
Ral, get in there!

6506
04:49:54,320 --> 04:49:55,040
What?!

6507
04:49:55,040 --> 04:49:57,320
How did he sidestep again?!

6508
04:49:58,020 --> 04:49:59,360
How does he keep...

6509
04:49:59,360 --> 04:50:02,720
How does he keep sidestepping?!

6510
04:50:05,860 --> 04:50:07,280
I'm so unlucky.

6511
04:50:07,760 --> 04:50:12,140
I'm actually so unlucky.

6512
04:50:12,140 --> 04:50:14,580
He actually sidestepped.

6513
04:50:15,560 --> 04:50:16,260
Oh my God.

6514
04:50:16,260 --> 04:50:16,800
He's so close.

6515
04:50:17,360 --> 04:50:18,120
This is it.

6516
04:50:20,100 --> 04:50:21,440
He's setting in!

6517
04:50:21,620 --> 04:50:22,340
He's getting tight!

6518
04:50:22,420 --> 04:50:22,880
He's getting eepy!

6519
04:50:24,480 --> 04:50:25,940
He's getting eepy, guys!

6520
04:50:28,600 --> 04:50:29,200
Oh God.

6521
04:50:30,160 --> 04:50:31,700
Oh, I didn't get further away though.

6522
04:50:31,760 --> 04:50:32,760
I didn't get further away though.

6523
04:50:32,980 --> 04:50:33,160
Woo!

6524
04:50:34,340 --> 04:50:34,800
Okay.

6525
04:50:34,900 --> 04:50:35,320
Nice.

6526
04:50:37,880 --> 04:50:38,340
Okay.

6527
04:50:40,880 --> 04:50:42,040
Oh, one hit!

6528
04:50:42,040 --> 04:50:42,520
One more hit!

6529
04:50:43,400 --> 04:50:44,000
Quadruple hit!

6530
04:50:44,220 --> 04:50:44,960
Last hit here!

6531
04:50:46,400 --> 04:50:47,340
This has to be it!

6532
04:50:48,060 --> 04:50:48,500
Yes!

6533
04:50:48,640 --> 04:50:49,080
Yes!

6534
04:50:54,100 --> 04:50:55,020
This should be it!

6535
04:50:55,520 --> 04:50:56,960
This should be now phase three!

6536
04:51:06,900 --> 04:51:07,680
Did I do it?

6537
04:51:08,620 --> 04:51:09,060
Yes!

6538
04:51:09,880 --> 04:51:10,540
Are you okay?

6539
04:51:10,760 --> 04:51:10,880
Oh!

6540
04:51:13,080 --> 04:51:15,060
Even the angels are in the army.

6541
04:51:15,420 --> 04:51:19,300
Do you truly believe that what you are doing is right?

6542
04:51:19,920 --> 04:51:21,100
Where's the other angels?

6543
04:51:21,680 --> 04:51:23,620
The divine one is perfect.

6544
04:51:24,040 --> 04:51:26,280
And as his child, so am I.

6545
04:51:27,060 --> 04:51:30,960
Obviously, it is not even possible for me to do wrong.

6546
04:51:31,760 --> 04:51:34,320
But doesn't God say thou shalt not dope up?

6547
04:51:38,320 --> 04:51:40,200
Is that in the commandments?

6548
04:51:44,880 --> 04:51:48,380
It's up to me, Lulia, to guide you back to the...

6549
04:51:48,380 --> 04:51:49,640
Hey, right with wings.

6550
04:51:50,620 --> 04:51:50,820
Oh!

6551
04:51:52,920 --> 04:51:55,140
Oh, I'm powerful!

6552
04:52:01,830 --> 04:52:03,070
Oh my God!

6553
04:52:03,110 --> 04:52:03,790
My shirt!

6554
04:52:05,290 --> 04:52:06,390
My cape!

6555
04:52:06,810 --> 04:52:07,970
Said your prayers yet?

6556
04:52:09,150 --> 04:52:10,030
Whoa.

6557
04:52:11,710 --> 04:52:12,590
Badass!

6558
04:52:15,710 --> 04:52:16,590
Like...

6559
04:52:17,350 --> 04:52:18,290
I'd let...

6560
04:52:18,290 --> 04:52:20,630
an angel...

6561
04:52:22,530 --> 04:52:24,430
be more evil!

6562
04:52:57,760 --> 04:53:01,140
Oh my god, can we still go?

6563
04:53:04,700 --> 04:53:06,240
Oh, Jen's built the urn!

6564
04:53:07,520 --> 04:53:09,280
Jen threw it up!

6565
04:53:11,700 --> 04:53:13,340
What the fuck?

6566
04:53:16,120 --> 04:53:18,360
When's Lilith?

6567
04:53:20,020 --> 04:53:20,580
Mom!

6568
04:53:21,000 --> 04:53:21,860
Sister!

6569
04:53:21,860 --> 04:53:21,980
Sister!

6570
04:53:33,460 --> 04:53:38,060
Wait, if the urn falls and it cracks then it frees them.

6571
04:53:42,560 --> 04:53:43,440
Mom's alive!

6572
04:53:43,440 --> 04:53:43,520
She's alive!

6573
04:53:49,100 --> 04:53:50,580
Is this timed?

6574
04:53:50,720 --> 04:53:52,000
I hope it's not timed.

6575
04:53:52,180 --> 04:53:53,020
Cause I need a fixed chat.

6576
04:53:55,360 --> 04:53:56,900
Are we gonna save chicken wings?

6577
04:53:57,260 --> 04:53:59,880
I can't believe it, we're saving chicken wings.

6578
04:54:00,640 --> 04:54:02,600
You can tell he wants to save him.

6579
04:54:02,740 --> 04:54:05,840
We didn't save Epi, but we saved chicken wings?

6580
04:54:18,660 --> 04:54:19,960
He's changing his heart.

6581
04:54:22,760 --> 04:54:24,780
Sinners don't do a Queenie.

6582
04:54:24,780 --> 04:54:26,520
Thank you for the super chat, Kaz.

6583
04:54:26,600 --> 04:54:27,440
Thank you, thank you.

6584
04:54:35,360 --> 04:54:37,380
That's what happens in war!

6585
04:54:42,760 --> 04:54:46,020
Jesus, he's used his cyborg strength for that.

6586
04:54:47,780 --> 04:54:48,640
Not before our eyes!

6587
04:54:50,000 --> 04:54:51,940
We're ascending too fast now.

6588
04:54:52,500 --> 04:54:53,480
It's no use!

6589
04:54:54,040 --> 04:54:55,940
I've lost all control over it!

6590
04:54:56,140 --> 04:54:59,080
The Equadium's gonna explode any moment now!

6591
04:54:59,900 --> 04:55:00,680
Abandon ship!

6592
04:55:01,040 --> 04:55:02,620
There's nothing else we can do!

6593
04:55:03,100 --> 04:55:05,180
Use the escape pods by the command center!

6594
04:55:05,480 --> 04:55:06,380
Go on, now!

6595
04:55:09,860 --> 04:55:10,840
Supreme Commander!

6596
04:55:11,180 --> 04:55:12,160
We've been waiting!

6597
04:55:12,600 --> 04:55:15,760
Is he... Is he seeing pods?

6598
04:55:16,160 --> 04:55:17,660
Oh, so I need to tap buttons.

6599
04:55:17,780 --> 04:55:19,200
I need to reload my chat real fast.

6600
04:55:19,520 --> 04:55:20,900
It's the same pods!

6601
04:55:21,980 --> 04:55:25,860
These are... Yeah, that's us!

6602
04:55:36,360 --> 04:55:37,920
Soldier, get out!

6603
04:55:41,700 --> 04:55:42,980
Goodbye, soldier!

6604
04:55:47,880 --> 04:55:50,420
Sorry, ma'am, but that's a safety pass.

6605
04:55:52,040 --> 04:55:54,000
There's five main characters.

6606
04:55:54,140 --> 04:55:56,040
I don't know what his problem is.

6607
04:55:57,280 --> 04:55:59,660
There's one guy with no name.

6608
04:56:00,700 --> 04:56:01,460
Don't worry.

6609
04:56:01,640 --> 04:56:02,180
I'm feed.

6610
04:56:03,700 --> 04:56:05,680
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

6611
04:56:05,840 --> 04:56:07,740
If anyone should stay...

6612
04:56:07,740 --> 04:56:10,660
Everyone that has a name, get in the Saiyan pod!

6613
04:56:11,340 --> 04:56:12,440
I'll start with this.

6614
04:56:12,800 --> 04:56:15,120
I'll stay and see it through to the end.

6615
04:56:16,040 --> 04:56:17,960
Quit brooding and get in the pod!

6616
04:56:22,570 --> 04:56:23,570
Where's the soldier?

6617
04:56:26,290 --> 04:56:27,730
There's only three people there!

6618
04:56:29,010 --> 04:56:30,770
Don't trust the word of a fiend!

6619
04:56:32,770 --> 04:56:33,590
I do.

6620
04:56:33,810 --> 04:56:34,930
More than anything.

6621
04:56:47,050 --> 04:56:48,450
They're at the back!

6622
04:56:52,830 --> 04:56:54,210
Am I gonna save chicken wings?

6623
04:56:54,210 --> 04:56:54,370
Wings?

6624
04:57:01,110 --> 04:57:01,690
Oh!

6625
04:57:02,470 --> 04:57:03,310
I am!

6626
04:57:10,980 --> 04:57:12,820
It's okay, just drink your serum!

6627
04:57:14,000 --> 04:57:16,880
Oh my god, this sucks because I'm actually just limping.

6628
04:57:17,690 --> 04:57:19,140
I can't even walk faster.

6629
04:57:22,280 --> 04:57:23,500
Alright, chicken wings.

6630
04:57:24,700 --> 04:57:26,420
Time to pull you up!

6631
04:57:29,460 --> 04:57:30,020
Why?

6632
04:57:30,020 --> 04:57:32,660
Why do we need to save Munya?

6633
04:57:34,800 --> 04:57:36,540
He already sinned!

6634
04:57:40,270 --> 04:57:41,950
Just use your heals, bro!

6635
04:57:42,070 --> 04:57:43,210
I spent so much money!

6636
04:58:02,570 --> 04:58:04,210
Why are you here?

6637
04:58:04,350 --> 04:58:04,710
Where's bread?

6638
04:58:05,970 --> 04:58:07,470
We made it this far together.

6639
04:58:07,790 --> 04:58:09,250
Why would we separate now?

6640
04:58:09,570 --> 04:58:11,670
So only the soldier took the pod?

6641
04:58:11,990 --> 04:58:12,750
I said that.

6642
04:58:14,590 --> 04:58:16,690
I mean I appreciate it.

6643
04:58:16,750 --> 04:58:17,970
Yeah, how are we gonna get down?

6644
04:58:18,030 --> 04:58:19,030
How are we gonna get down?

6645
04:58:20,210 --> 04:58:21,310
You can take us.

6646
04:58:21,610 --> 04:58:23,310
Can't you just fly us all down there?

6647
04:58:23,550 --> 04:58:24,570
With four people?

6648
04:58:26,790 --> 04:58:30,190
It might work with just chicken wings and not the carry-on.

6649
04:58:30,230 --> 04:58:31,330
Poor Myra people!

6650
04:58:39,510 --> 04:58:42,310
Oh man, that was a poor planning.

6651
04:58:44,310 --> 04:58:45,670
Yeah, what do we do?

6652
04:58:45,770 --> 04:58:46,110
Anne?

6653
04:58:52,670 --> 04:58:53,270
What's this?

6654
04:59:00,910 --> 04:59:01,750
Oh!

6655
04:59:05,290 --> 04:59:07,090
It's a little candy!

6656
04:59:11,110 --> 04:59:12,650
Damn, 10 whole seconds?

6657
04:59:12,890 --> 04:59:13,330
Woah!

6658
04:59:15,830 --> 04:59:16,670
Okay...

6659
04:59:17,870 --> 04:59:19,670
That's a lot of faith.

6660
04:59:22,750 --> 04:59:26,670
Just drop down until 10 seconds.

6661
04:59:27,330 --> 04:59:28,850
You know if you're too high up?

6662
04:59:29,430 --> 04:59:31,770
You won't even die before you hit the floor.

6663
04:59:31,870 --> 04:59:34,990
You literally die from a heart attack because of the pressure.

6664
04:59:35,650 --> 04:59:37,050
Before you hit the floor.

6665
04:59:37,110 --> 04:59:39,350
Before you die from the death of the floor.

6666
04:59:39,710 --> 04:59:43,310
So all I'm saying is that like...

6667
04:59:45,370 --> 04:59:47,370
Scientifically, that's not how it should work.

6668
04:59:50,290 --> 04:59:51,630
Well, there she goes!

6669
04:59:51,690 --> 04:59:52,650
That's very fast.

6670
04:59:55,330 --> 04:59:57,450
Or like, yeah, lack of oxygen.

6671
04:59:59,390 --> 05:00:00,830
Beef, your turn!

6672
05:00:02,010 --> 05:00:04,250
Guys, I have a bucket of water!

6673
05:00:07,790 --> 05:00:09,150
Mythbusters sad land!

6674
05:00:11,470 --> 05:00:12,910
Oh, hurry up!

6675
05:00:19,870 --> 05:00:23,210
It's like... It's like Bureau Clock all over again.

6676
05:00:27,840 --> 05:00:29,160
Here we go!

6677
05:00:36,580 --> 05:00:37,720
Oh no!

6678
05:00:39,040 --> 05:00:40,160
It's okay, I'm a fiend.

6679
05:00:40,220 --> 05:00:41,660
I don't get heart attacks from this guy.

6680
05:00:54,620 --> 05:00:58,020
What the fuck is the ga- I guess- Wait, but they don't have goggles.

6681
05:00:58,500 --> 05:01:00,180
I've only got one floaty tablet left?

6682
05:01:01,080 --> 05:01:02,220
Did you not count?

6683
05:01:02,560 --> 05:01:02,900
Hold on.

6684
05:01:03,360 --> 05:01:05,300
He can't swallow one while he's knocked out.

6685
05:01:06,260 --> 05:01:07,080
Well, okay.

6686
05:01:07,620 --> 05:01:09,180
Guess I gotta take care of this- The others don't have goggles?

6687
05:01:30,040 --> 05:01:31,040
What the fuck?

6688
05:01:38,840 --> 05:01:40,860
Is it- Did that help me?

6689
05:01:42,740 --> 05:01:43,300
Dad?

6690
05:01:47,930 --> 05:01:48,490
Dad!

6691
05:01:49,430 --> 05:01:49,870
Dad!

6692
05:01:51,450 --> 05:01:53,810
Were you able to get out of the jar on your own?

6693
05:01:54,050 --> 05:01:54,570
No.

6694
05:01:54,950 --> 05:01:57,810
As luck would have it, the urn smashed against a rock.

6695
05:01:58,630 --> 05:01:59,210
The bra!

6696
05:02:00,150 --> 05:02:01,670
You saved me from a rough landing.

6697
05:02:01,790 --> 05:02:02,670
Oh, that was me.

6698
05:02:03,090 --> 05:02:03,650
Sister!

6699
05:02:03,870 --> 05:02:04,510
You're pink!

6700
05:02:04,910 --> 05:02:06,130
I knew it!

6701
05:02:07,530 --> 05:02:08,090
Whoa!

6702
05:02:08,950 --> 05:02:10,610
That- Whoa!

6703
05:02:12,450 --> 05:02:14,110
That help- Whoa!

6704
05:02:14,110 --> 05:02:14,570
Whoa!

6705
05:02:16,950 --> 05:02:17,470
Prince!

6706
05:02:18,190 --> 05:02:21,230
You had us worried you were up there for so long!

6707
05:02:22,130 --> 05:02:23,690
You all made it safely!

6708
05:02:23,870 --> 05:02:25,390
I told you the tablets would work!

6709
05:02:25,870 --> 05:02:27,790
Those things didn't help us at all!

6710
05:02:28,110 --> 05:02:29,790
Even the timing rat is impossible!

6711
05:02:30,530 --> 05:02:33,190
We all chickened out and took the tablets too soon!

6712
05:02:33,450 --> 05:02:35,770
So they wore off when we were still high up!

6713
05:02:35,970 --> 05:02:38,870
But before we crashed, some strange power saved us!

6714
05:02:39,790 --> 05:02:43,430
It looks like your family actually came to our rescue.

6715
05:02:44,110 --> 05:02:44,470
Ah!

6716
05:02:44,970 --> 05:02:45,730
Saved me too!

6717
05:02:45,750 --> 05:02:47,130
How come the sister doesn't have a tail?

6718
05:02:48,630 --> 05:02:49,190
Mom!

6719
05:02:53,190 --> 05:02:56,190
You must be... my mom?

6720
05:02:57,130 --> 05:02:58,990
She'd never seen her mom before?

6721
05:02:59,510 --> 05:03:01,430
I thought Moni El killed you!

6722
05:03:01,650 --> 05:03:04,010
Like, she's the same person, just pink!

6723
05:03:04,210 --> 05:03:05,050
There were two urns of sealing.

6724
05:03:05,310 --> 05:03:06,290
I was in the other.

6725
05:03:06,970 --> 05:03:11,410
You really think some second-rate angel could have defeated me without one of those?

6726
05:03:12,910 --> 05:03:13,470
Oh...

6727
05:03:14,110 --> 05:03:14,950
I see.

6728
05:03:23,990 --> 05:03:24,550
Aww!

6729
05:03:27,650 --> 05:03:30,490
Ma'am, you've grown up so much.

6730
05:03:36,600 --> 05:03:38,280
Please, stop that!

6731
05:03:39,640 --> 05:03:40,500
My father?

6732
05:03:41,720 --> 05:03:42,560
He's fine.

6733
05:03:43,120 --> 05:03:43,920
Thank goodness.

6734
05:03:44,300 --> 05:03:47,680
So this... is your daughter, Lilith?

6735
05:03:47,880 --> 05:03:50,380
I guess we're all just a king chat now!

6736
05:03:50,580 --> 05:03:52,200
Well then, thank you Super Chat!

6737
05:03:52,320 --> 05:03:52,520
Thank you!

6738
05:03:55,220 --> 05:03:59,860
Never refer to me by this undignified form of address again!

6739
05:04:00,140 --> 05:04:01,520
I am Lucifer!

6740
05:04:02,060 --> 05:04:03,740
The King of Demons!

6741
05:04:03,820 --> 05:04:05,760
What the f*** was she gonna say to you?!

6742
05:04:05,760 --> 05:04:06,300
Your Majesty?

6743
05:04:06,600 --> 05:04:07,060
Oh...

6744
05:04:07,060 --> 05:04:08,400
But you're a princess too!

6745
05:04:09,580 --> 05:04:10,180
That?

6746
05:04:10,340 --> 05:04:11,140
Oh no, that's bread.

6747
05:04:11,300 --> 05:04:11,680
Nevermind.

6748
05:04:11,940 --> 05:04:12,580
Queen Lilith.

6749
05:04:13,000 --> 05:04:14,340
And Princess Anne!

6750
05:04:15,360 --> 05:04:19,740
I deeply regret what I did ten years ago.

6751
05:04:20,480 --> 05:04:22,480
I was wrong about fiends.

6752
05:04:39,320 --> 05:04:39,880
Yeah.

6753
05:04:42,540 --> 05:04:45,240
Speak to all those wives that lost their husbands!

6754
05:04:45,920 --> 05:04:48,540
And all those children that lost their fathers!

6755
05:04:57,400 --> 05:04:57,600
Yeah!

6756
05:05:15,040 --> 05:05:17,360
Get those tree-huggers!

6757
05:05:18,200 --> 05:05:22,280
Yeah, what shall we do with chicken wings?

6758
05:05:27,400 --> 05:05:27,900
I'll take care of it then.

6759
05:05:29,700 --> 05:05:30,680
Serves him right.

6760
05:05:32,720 --> 05:05:33,320
Rain?

6761
05:05:33,880 --> 05:05:35,040
In sunlight?

6762
05:05:35,700 --> 05:05:35,820
Guys!

6763
05:05:35,820 --> 05:05:36,420
You see this?

6764
05:05:36,600 --> 05:05:37,320
It's raining!

6765
05:05:37,840 --> 05:05:38,800
Well, I'll be!

6766
05:05:40,500 --> 05:05:41,420
How's it rain?

6767
05:05:41,880 --> 05:05:42,800
It's the Aquanium at work.

6768
05:05:43,220 --> 05:05:44,340
The Aquanium?

6769
05:05:44,820 --> 05:05:48,460
It took 30 years, but it's being used as the Pichi intended.

6770
05:05:49,100 --> 05:05:49,700
Finally.

6771
05:05:51,980 --> 05:05:53,680
By the way, human.

6772
05:05:53,900 --> 05:05:55,960
What was your name again?

6773
05:05:56,420 --> 05:05:56,600
Oh!

6774
05:05:57,400 --> 05:05:58,440
Welcome to Mudland.

6775
05:06:03,360 --> 05:06:05,360
No, not what's said!

6776
05:06:27,400 --> 05:06:28,000
Treasure chest.

6777
05:06:28,680 --> 05:06:29,260
Huh?

6778
05:06:29,460 --> 05:06:30,040
Dad!

6779
05:06:30,160 --> 05:06:33,420
I was wondering if I can play games for two hours a day now.

6780
05:06:33,780 --> 05:06:34,360
Maybe?

6781
05:06:34,960 --> 05:06:36,520
Don't push your luck.

6782
05:06:38,140 --> 05:06:41,460
Practicing your flying would be a far better use of your time.

6783
05:06:42,300 --> 05:06:42,880
Right!

6784
05:06:44,260 --> 05:06:45,700
I thought you said you're going to fly!

6785
05:06:50,860 --> 05:06:51,440
Yay!

6786
05:06:52,960 --> 05:06:54,180
We did it!

6787
05:06:54,440 --> 05:06:55,740
Oh my god!

6788
05:06:56,720 --> 05:06:57,640
It is...

6789
05:06:59,490 --> 05:07:00,790
That's when you win!

6790
05:07:00,790 --> 05:07:04,150
You know we beat the game when the rainbow comes on the screen.

6791
05:07:04,390 --> 05:07:05,390
Is there after credits?

6792
05:07:05,910 --> 05:07:07,810
Thank you Toriyama-san.

6793
05:07:10,890 --> 05:07:12,350
Oh my god!

6794
05:07:12,450 --> 05:07:14,030
Is there an after credits, guys?

6795
05:07:14,430 --> 05:07:14,830
Ooh!

6796
05:07:15,110 --> 05:07:15,950
There's screenshots.

6797
05:07:17,790 --> 05:07:18,670
There is?

6798
05:07:19,010 --> 05:07:20,450
Okay, I'll wait until after credits.

6799
05:07:21,090 --> 05:07:22,210
Oh my god!

6800
05:07:22,310 --> 05:07:23,810
We finally did it!

6801
05:07:23,890 --> 05:07:24,270
Chat!

6802
05:07:24,710 --> 05:07:25,350
Dragos!

6803
05:07:25,610 --> 05:07:28,370
We beat our first JRPG!

6804
05:07:29,370 --> 05:07:29,890
Oh!

6805
05:07:31,710 --> 05:07:33,170
I'm so proud of us.

6806
05:07:33,210 --> 05:07:34,130
We stuck it through.

6807
05:07:34,370 --> 05:07:36,790
It took us a lot, a lot of time.

6808
05:07:37,030 --> 05:07:40,610
But it took us all the way until I got a new skin suit.

6809
05:07:40,710 --> 05:07:42,810
And we finally beat it!

6810
05:07:43,870 --> 05:07:44,390
Oh!

6811
05:07:44,390 --> 05:07:47,390
What a wild ride that was.

6812
05:07:49,830 --> 05:07:51,370
That was great though.

6813
05:07:51,410 --> 05:07:52,050
I had a great time.

6814
05:07:52,370 --> 05:07:54,670
My very first JRPG that I've ever finished.

6815
05:07:54,810 --> 05:07:56,670
Potter, thank you for the 20 gifted ships!

6816
05:07:56,810 --> 05:07:56,990
Thank you!

6817
05:07:56,990 --> 05:07:57,610
Thank you!

6818
05:07:57,710 --> 05:07:58,750
I really appreciate it.

6819
05:07:59,770 --> 05:08:02,290
But like, honestly, I had a great time.

6820
05:08:02,530 --> 05:08:03,010
I really did.

6821
05:08:03,150 --> 05:08:05,710
I know some of the dungeons were a little bit slow, like a bit repetitive.

6822
05:08:06,070 --> 05:08:08,870
But I really did enjoy playing this game with all you guys.

6823
05:08:09,010 --> 05:08:13,070
And like, you know, getting to connect with Bandai too because of Sandland.

6824
05:08:13,410 --> 05:08:14,730
It was such a great opportunity.

6825
05:08:15,330 --> 05:08:18,750
And I'm really happy to be actually able to finish it for you guys.

6826
05:08:18,990 --> 05:08:23,110
I've never, like I said, I've never finished a JRPG before.

6827
05:08:23,430 --> 05:08:25,530
But this is like a mixture of action.

6828
05:08:25,530 --> 05:08:28,890
So like, it made me be able to play it actually.

6829
05:08:29,110 --> 05:08:34,470
Like I wasn't as, like, I used to get really bored with JRPGs in general.

6830
05:08:34,550 --> 05:08:38,090
Because like, I don't really like the fighting mechanics for JRPGs.

6831
05:08:39,710 --> 05:08:41,670
Because it's just a preference for me.

6832
05:08:41,790 --> 05:08:45,170
So I'm really happy that like, you know, I like the action in this.

6833
05:08:45,490 --> 05:08:49,530
And I really like the action mechanics within this in Sandland.

6834
05:08:49,610 --> 05:08:53,870
So it really did make it very much more playable for me.

6835
05:08:53,950 --> 05:08:54,410
And...

6836
05:08:54,410 --> 05:08:55,670
It was...

6837
05:08:55,670 --> 05:08:57,110
Take it to the end!

6838
05:08:58,930 --> 05:08:59,530
Um...

6839
05:09:00,190 --> 05:09:00,790
Um...

6840
05:09:00,790 --> 05:09:04,290
But yeah, I really like the animation in the 3D models too.

6841
05:09:04,470 --> 05:09:09,870
I liked how the 3D models really emphasized Toriyama-san's art style.

6842
05:09:10,130 --> 05:09:13,610
And how it was very well modeled and very well animated for 3D.

6843
05:09:14,270 --> 05:09:17,290
Because it looks 2D for a 3D model.

6844
05:09:17,430 --> 05:09:20,810
Which is like such an accomplishment to do in general.

6845
05:09:21,750 --> 05:09:22,350
Uh...

6846
05:09:23,610 --> 05:09:24,210
And...

6847
05:09:24,410 --> 05:09:25,130
That's all I want to say.

6848
05:09:25,310 --> 05:09:28,810
But I'm so happy to finish this game with you guys and get to the ending!

6849
05:09:29,910 --> 05:09:30,970
Oh my god!

6850
05:09:31,330 --> 05:09:32,370
Fucking Chiku...

6851
05:09:32,370 --> 05:09:32,930
Oh my gosh.

6852
05:09:32,970 --> 05:09:34,210
I wish he put on a shirt.

6853
05:09:34,490 --> 05:09:35,290
I wish!

6854
05:09:35,830 --> 05:09:37,270
I wish!

6855
05:09:37,750 --> 05:09:39,030
If only he...

6856
05:09:39,030 --> 05:09:41,870
I did not want to see him without the shirt.

6857
05:09:42,050 --> 05:09:45,610
I really did not like it when he took off his shirt, man.

6858
05:09:49,370 --> 05:09:50,330
It was...

6859
05:09:50,330 --> 05:09:52,270
It was very uncomfortable.

6860
05:09:56,510 --> 05:09:57,190
Yeah...

6861
05:09:57,190 --> 05:09:59,730
The chicken wings are very curt .

6862
05:09:59,730 --> 05:10:01,690
They really were .

6863
05:10:03,710 --> 05:10:04,750
But yeah!

6864
05:10:05,850 --> 05:10:06,530
Oh...

6865
05:10:06,530 --> 05:10:08,830
I don't know if I can just skip the credits.

6866
05:10:09,070 --> 05:10:11,530
So am just gonna wait until it plays to the end.

6867
05:10:11,650 --> 05:10:12,170
It's been alright.

6868
05:10:12,510 --> 05:10:14,890
It's been a wild wild ride today.

6869
05:10:15,230 --> 05:10:18,090
A wild ride in the tank...

6870
05:10:18,090 --> 05:10:19,110
That's for sure.

6871
05:10:20,010 --> 05:10:21,270
I'm gonna stretch!

6872
05:10:22,630 --> 05:10:23,310
Yeah...

6873
05:10:23,310 --> 05:10:24,050
Oh yeah!

6874
05:10:24,310 --> 05:10:26,270
I heard First Descendant came out today.

6875
05:10:26,510 --> 05:10:27,510
Or was it yesterday?

6876
05:10:27,710 --> 05:10:28,350
How is it?

6877
05:10:28,530 --> 05:10:29,670
You think it's worth playing?

6878
05:10:29,950 --> 05:10:33,750
People said it's basically Korean... it's a Korean developer, right?

6879
05:10:34,030 --> 05:10:34,990
Korean publishing?

6880
05:10:35,330 --> 05:10:41,230
It's basically Destiny, but like... Destiny 2, but...

6881
05:10:43,810 --> 05:10:46,310
But like made by Korean developers.

6882
05:10:48,590 --> 05:10:51,050
Yeah, because I heard it was like Nexon.

6883
05:10:52,050 --> 05:10:54,810
But I saw people were trying to play it because they're like...

6884
05:10:54,810 --> 05:10:58,230
Since it's like similar to Warframe slash Destiny 2.

6885
05:10:59,230 --> 05:11:01,730
I know it just came out today.

6886
05:11:02,130 --> 05:11:02,810
I don't know.

6887
05:11:04,270 --> 05:11:05,070
Free to play?

6888
05:11:05,190 --> 05:11:05,470
Okay.

6889
05:11:08,850 --> 05:11:12,550
It says free to play, but you know damn well like later...

6890
05:11:14,210 --> 05:11:15,950
There's a system in place in there.

6891
05:11:15,950 --> 05:11:19,290
That justifies the free to play.

6892
05:11:19,410 --> 05:11:19,850
Yeah.

6893
05:11:20,110 --> 05:11:21,910
Quote on quote on the free.

6894
05:11:26,810 --> 05:11:28,270
It has mixed reviews.

6895
05:11:28,450 --> 05:11:30,110
I guess I won't try it out then.

6896
05:11:30,230 --> 05:11:34,890
I was like thinking if I should try out the First Descendant next week.

6897
05:11:35,150 --> 05:11:39,330
But if it has mixed reviews, then I won't check it out.

6898
05:11:41,250 --> 05:11:43,510
Yeah, the microtransactions and stuff.

6899
05:11:43,770 --> 05:11:44,970
I know that's what I was thinking.

6900
05:11:45,010 --> 05:11:45,930
I was like wondering if I should try it out.

6901
05:11:45,930 --> 05:11:50,730
Because people were like yeah, it's the next game that's coming out.

6902
05:11:50,790 --> 05:11:52,130
Next big game that's coming out.

6903
05:11:52,470 --> 05:11:56,310
To be fair, a lot of AAA games.

6904
05:11:57,170 --> 05:12:01,370
I mean, I feel like Nexon is considered AAA publisher.

6905
05:12:01,910 --> 05:12:04,550
Because they have made a lot of big games too.

6906
05:12:05,210 --> 05:12:07,830
But and that blind girl, Raine Bland forever.

6907
05:12:07,930 --> 05:12:09,170
Oh yeah, we never cured her.

6908
05:12:09,370 --> 05:12:09,910
Oh yeah!

6909
05:12:11,450 --> 05:12:13,370
Thank you for the super chat.

6910
05:12:13,490 --> 05:12:13,850
Thank you.

6911
05:12:13,890 --> 05:12:15,050
We never cured.

6912
05:12:15,930 --> 05:12:18,210
We never cured the blind girl.

6913
05:12:18,310 --> 05:12:20,930
We killed the alpha raptor.

6914
05:12:20,950 --> 05:12:24,190
But we never came back to cure her.

6915
05:12:28,770 --> 05:12:29,150
Oops.

6916
05:12:31,870 --> 05:12:33,910
That's my bad.

6917
05:12:34,510 --> 05:12:36,190
That's my bad.

6918
05:12:38,110 --> 05:12:42,550
Oh yeah, the whole Dark and Darker thing that happened.

6919
05:12:42,730 --> 05:12:44,930
Yeah, I didn't end up playing Dark and Darker.

6920
05:12:44,930 --> 05:12:48,570
Because when it came out, a lot of people gave mixed reviews about it.

6921
05:12:48,630 --> 05:12:52,250
Because apparently, even though it was like free to play back on Steam.

6922
05:12:52,450 --> 05:12:54,630
The updates for it was not great.

6923
05:12:55,090 --> 05:12:56,350
I don't know they fixed it.

6924
05:12:56,470 --> 05:12:57,610
I was like thinking about it.

6925
05:12:57,650 --> 05:12:59,750
But then I read the reviews and people were like it's not.

6926
05:12:59,890 --> 05:13:01,750
It says free to play but you have to pay.

6927
05:13:02,370 --> 05:13:03,610
Because you don't keep your loot.

6928
05:13:03,730 --> 05:13:05,510
You don't keep your loot if you're playing the free version.

6929
05:13:05,650 --> 05:13:07,510
You have to pay to keep the loot or something.

6930
05:13:07,890 --> 05:13:09,090
Or like to unlock stuff.

6931
05:13:10,030 --> 05:13:12,750
That's why people were like yeah, it's free but it's bait.

6932
05:13:13,450 --> 05:13:14,830
That's why I never checked it out.

6933
05:13:14,830 --> 05:13:16,730
Because I know when I was like oh it's free to play.

6934
05:13:16,770 --> 05:13:17,610
I might try it next week.

6935
05:13:17,690 --> 05:13:20,170
But then I read the reviews and people were like...

6936
05:13:21,270 --> 05:13:22,870
People were like oh yeah, it's bait.

6937
05:13:23,110 --> 05:13:26,510
Like if you actually really want to unlock more of the game.

6938
05:13:26,630 --> 05:13:28,150
You have to pay money for it.

6939
05:13:28,370 --> 05:13:30,230
Because like if you play the free version.

6940
05:13:30,570 --> 05:13:33,130
You don't keep your loot at all after a run.

6941
05:13:33,590 --> 05:13:34,530
Something like that.

6942
05:13:36,950 --> 05:13:37,350
Yeah.

6943
05:13:39,770 --> 05:13:40,930
Yeah, you get the...

6944
05:13:40,930 --> 05:13:42,030
I mean obviously.

6945
05:13:42,410 --> 05:13:43,450
I mean that's the whole mechanic.

6946
05:13:43,510 --> 05:13:44,650
You get the loot if you can get out.

6947
05:13:44,650 --> 05:13:45,430
But like...

6948
05:13:46,350 --> 05:13:48,270
And you have to pay to have another character.

6949
05:13:48,570 --> 05:13:49,750
Yeah, I saw that too.

6950
05:13:49,970 --> 05:13:51,790
I saw that you have to pay to get another character.

6951
05:13:51,890 --> 05:13:53,890
I just saw a lot of like...

6952
05:13:54,330 --> 05:13:56,150
A lot of like complaints about it.

6953
05:13:56,230 --> 05:13:58,650
Because it went from positive reviews when it came out.

6954
05:13:58,730 --> 05:13:59,930
To like negative.

6955
05:14:00,250 --> 05:14:02,770
To like I don't know if it has negative or mixed right now.

6956
05:14:03,610 --> 05:14:06,210
But I saw that it went from positive.

6957
05:14:06,330 --> 05:14:08,450
Because everyone was like yay it's back on Steam.

6958
05:14:08,870 --> 05:14:12,490
And then straight to negative after like one day.

6959
05:14:15,210 --> 05:14:17,390
And I was like reading some of the reviews.

6960
05:14:17,570 --> 05:14:19,090
I was like what the f*** happened?

6961
05:14:19,450 --> 05:14:20,970
The people were happy.

6962
05:14:23,150 --> 05:14:24,030
And then...

6963
05:14:24,030 --> 05:14:24,950
And I...

6964
05:14:25,530 --> 05:14:26,250
Now I don't know.

6965
05:14:26,290 --> 05:14:27,390
I don't know if it's mixed now.

6966
05:14:27,610 --> 05:14:28,910
Or like if it's still negative.

6967
05:14:37,810 --> 05:14:39,550
You just buy if you don't...

6968
05:14:39,550 --> 05:14:40,010
If you like...

6969
05:14:40,010 --> 05:14:41,070
It's just like people...

6970
05:14:41,070 --> 05:14:43,610
The thing is people don't like to be like baited.

6971
05:14:43,770 --> 05:14:44,390
You know?

6972
05:14:44,650 --> 05:14:46,190
If it's gonna be free.

6973
05:14:46,390 --> 05:14:48,870
Because when they dropped it on Steam.

6974
05:14:48,990 --> 05:14:51,370
They made it like it's free now.

6975
05:14:51,910 --> 05:14:54,070
So it baited a lot of people.

6976
05:14:54,270 --> 05:14:56,530
And people hate getting baited.

6977
05:14:56,550 --> 05:14:56,910
You know?

6978
05:14:57,070 --> 05:14:58,110
People hate it.

6979
05:14:58,150 --> 05:15:00,310
Because they feel like they got like you know.

6980
05:15:00,310 --> 05:15:01,930
They got like scam type deal.

6981
05:15:01,990 --> 05:15:02,690
Like you know it's free.

6982
05:15:02,830 --> 05:15:04,610
But like oh you baited me into this.

6983
05:15:04,770 --> 05:15:06,730
So people were mad.

6984
05:15:06,870 --> 05:15:08,450
Because they're like just call it a demo then.

6985
05:15:08,510 --> 05:15:09,830
Don't say it's free to play.

6986
05:15:11,210 --> 05:15:14,150
Just call it a demo instead of free to play.

6987
05:15:14,150 --> 05:15:16,510
Because in the end all the actual...

6988
05:15:16,510 --> 05:15:22,630
All the actual like game mechanics is locked behind a paywall.

6989
05:15:22,830 --> 05:15:24,650
So people got really mad about it.

6990
05:15:27,870 --> 05:15:29,090
Or a free trial.

6991
05:15:29,230 --> 05:15:30,770
So that's why it got review bombed.

6992
05:15:30,990 --> 05:15:31,730
Because everyone...

6993
05:15:31,730 --> 05:15:35,310
Because like when they released they announced Dark and Darker being back on Steam.

6994
05:15:35,990 --> 05:15:38,810
During the Summerfest or whatever.

6995
05:15:39,630 --> 05:15:41,590
During the Summer Game Fest.

6996
05:15:41,730 --> 05:15:43,430
They just said it's back on Steam.

6997
05:15:43,450 --> 05:15:44,130
And it's free to play.

6998
05:15:44,130 --> 05:15:45,830
They never said anything about it.

6999
05:15:46,430 --> 05:15:49,230
They never said anything about it being locked behind.

7000
05:15:49,390 --> 05:15:51,790
Like have like certain mechanics being locked behind paywall.

7001
05:15:51,930 --> 05:15:54,670
So everyone was like this is fucked up.

7002
05:15:54,850 --> 05:15:56,810
And people hate getting baited.

7003
05:16:01,030 --> 05:16:01,550
Yeah.

7004
05:16:01,730 --> 05:16:02,230
Yeah.

7005
05:16:02,290 --> 05:16:05,550
If anything people are very passionate when they get misled.

7006
05:16:09,510 --> 05:16:10,730
It's mostly positive.

7007
05:16:10,910 --> 05:16:11,770
Now that's good to know.

7008
05:16:11,870 --> 05:16:13,590
I think they might have like also...

7009
05:16:14,130 --> 05:16:16,190
Apparently updated the game to...

7010
05:16:16,590 --> 05:16:18,770
They updated the game to like...

7011
05:16:18,770 --> 05:16:20,570
To appease people.

7012
05:16:20,850 --> 05:16:24,170
Because I saw Surefour playing Dark and Darker earlier too.

7013
05:16:24,450 --> 05:16:25,810
Because at first he was like...

7014
05:16:25,810 --> 05:16:27,090
Nah I'm not gonna play it yet.

7015
05:16:27,150 --> 05:16:28,390
Because apparently he's like...

7016
05:16:28,390 --> 05:16:29,970
Nah it's not that great yet.

7017
05:16:30,250 --> 05:16:33,110
So if he's playing it again I assume that they updated it.

7018
05:16:33,110 --> 05:16:36,550
And so Rain fell on Sandland for the first time in decades.

7019
05:16:36,830 --> 05:16:38,750
Bringing with it many changes.

7020
05:16:41,350 --> 05:16:42,310
Oh hey.

7021
05:16:44,130 --> 05:16:45,090
Grass now.

7022
05:16:55,970 --> 05:16:57,590
She's not pink anymore!

7023
05:16:58,050 --> 05:17:00,610
Why are you ashamed of being pink?!

7024
05:17:04,010 --> 05:17:04,850
Nice.

7025
05:17:11,270 --> 05:17:11,690
No!

7026
05:17:11,890 --> 05:17:12,410
It's sad!

7027
05:17:12,930 --> 05:17:13,510
Hahaha!

7028
05:17:14,070 --> 05:17:14,910
Hahaha!

7029
05:17:14,970 --> 05:17:14,990
Hahaha!

7030
05:17:16,070 --> 05:17:23,310
Harry can fine -tuned Rosetta with repairing the rift between humans and demons to prevent further misunderstandings.

7031
05:17:23,450 --> 05:17:24,110
Ha ha ha ha!

7032
05:17:24,110 --> 05:17:24,850
Drop em!

7033
05:17:25,850 --> 05:17:27,890
He destroyed our home.

7034
05:17:29,530 --> 05:17:30,610
The angels!

7035
05:17:31,870 --> 05:17:32,510
Yeah!

7036
05:17:43,700 --> 05:17:44,340
Hahaha!

7037
05:17:48,820 --> 05:17:50,220
That's so fucked up!

7038
05:17:50,260 --> 05:17:51,620
Why don't they give him his wings back?

7039
05:17:51,620 --> 05:17:52,020
That's bad!

7040
05:17:58,140 --> 05:18:01,060
Oh my god, it's a Dragon Ball card!

7041
05:18:05,440 --> 05:18:07,640
He's working for Amazon now.

7042
05:18:08,440 --> 05:18:11,020
Into the Bezo mines you go!

7043
05:18:11,320 --> 05:18:13,620
It's time for the Amazon warehouses!

7044
05:18:30,040 --> 05:18:31,880
The world is not just sad then.

7045
05:18:55,340 --> 05:18:55,940
What?

7046
05:19:00,480 --> 05:19:01,680
Oh no!

7047
05:19:01,920 --> 05:19:02,780
Not the car!

7048
05:19:05,320 --> 05:19:05,920
Yeah!

7049
05:19:06,380 --> 05:19:07,820
Wait, Bells is me.

7050
05:19:08,140 --> 05:19:09,640
What did you do, Drago?

7051
05:19:13,900 --> 05:19:15,240
He's just like me!

7052
05:19:16,120 --> 05:19:17,560
For real, for real!

7053
05:19:17,880 --> 05:19:20,640
You guys are thief and I'm Bezo-bob.

7054
05:19:24,540 --> 05:19:27,320
Gonna need to take it to the garage in Spino to get it fixed up.

7055
05:19:28,300 --> 05:19:28,780
Yeah!

7056
05:19:29,080 --> 05:19:30,500
Spino is our next stop!

7057
05:19:31,140 --> 05:19:31,620
Hmm.

7058
05:19:33,760 --> 05:19:34,720
I'll come with you.

7059
05:19:35,420 --> 05:19:36,680
What about seeing the world?

7060
05:19:37,800 --> 05:19:38,280
Oh.

7061
05:19:38,840 --> 05:19:40,360
It's not like I'm in a hurry.

7062
05:19:40,800 --> 05:19:46,220
Pretty sure hanging around you guys will give my skills a better workout than seeing the world could.

7063
05:19:46,420 --> 05:19:46,900
What?

7064
05:19:47,020 --> 05:19:48,820
They're literally just going to the Peachy!

7065
05:19:49,060 --> 05:19:49,540
And it's settled!

7066
05:19:55,690 --> 05:19:57,170
It's road trip time!

7067
05:20:02,190 --> 05:20:02,390
Yeah!

7068
05:20:02,670 --> 05:20:04,230
Stay in Sandland!

7069
05:20:04,830 --> 05:20:05,530
Let's go!

7070
05:20:05,910 --> 05:20:07,110
Back to Spino!

7071
05:20:10,850 --> 05:20:13,270
You never leave Spino!

7072
05:20:15,890 --> 05:20:16,830
We did it!

7073
05:20:18,950 --> 05:20:20,430
We finished the game!

7074
05:20:21,270 --> 05:20:21,910
Yippee!

7075
05:20:22,890 --> 05:20:23,990
I'm so proud of us.

7076
05:20:24,030 --> 05:20:25,070
We fucking did it, guys!

7077
05:20:25,350 --> 05:20:27,870
We finally beat Sandland!

7078
05:20:28,430 --> 05:20:30,050
Alright, let's go back to...

7079
05:20:31,370 --> 05:20:32,150
Oh my gosh.

7080
05:20:32,230 --> 05:20:32,430
Whoops.

7081
05:20:32,590 --> 05:20:33,450
Sorry, chat broken.

7082
05:20:33,810 --> 05:20:34,030
Oops.

7083
05:20:34,770 --> 05:20:39,110
I forgot to post a chat here too.

7084
05:20:40,190 --> 05:20:40,630
Oh!

7085
05:20:41,550 --> 05:20:41,990
Whatever.

7086
05:20:42,130 --> 05:20:44,010
I'm gonna save the game.

7087
05:20:44,510 --> 05:20:50,930
Even though I never touched the game back after completing it, I still feel like I have to save it.

7088
05:20:51,330 --> 05:20:52,710
Oh hell, thank you for the super chat!

7089
05:20:52,790 --> 05:20:52,950
Thank you!

7090
05:20:53,330 --> 05:20:55,170
You finished Sandland while I was at work?

7091
05:20:55,250 --> 05:20:57,010
Do over at 2 minute do over.

7092
05:20:57,070 --> 05:20:58,350
Start from the beginning.

7093
05:20:59,030 --> 05:20:59,970
Oh my gosh.

7094
05:20:59,970 --> 05:21:00,670
Yeah, it was great though.

7095
05:21:00,770 --> 05:21:03,070
I'm so glad that we're not... we're never cured.

7096
05:21:03,150 --> 05:21:04,290
That girl's gonna stay blind forever.

7097
05:21:08,230 --> 05:21:09,350
Unfortunate to that girl.

7098
05:21:09,570 --> 05:21:12,670
She's gonna... she's just gonna be blind forever.

7099
05:21:14,970 --> 05:21:16,130
No do over.

7100
05:21:17,250 --> 05:21:17,670
Oh!

7101
05:21:17,670 --> 05:21:18,450
That's so fun!

7102
05:21:18,690 --> 05:21:19,350
I'm really happy.

7103
05:21:19,510 --> 05:21:21,370
Our very first JRPG.

7104
05:21:21,510 --> 05:21:23,370
I don't know what series to start next week.

7105
05:21:23,390 --> 05:21:26,550
There's so many games I really... I really want to play God of War.

7106
05:21:26,750 --> 05:21:28,710
I really do want to try out God of War.

7107
05:21:28,710 --> 05:21:30,070
Because I never played God of War before.

7108
05:21:30,370 --> 05:21:31,870
But there's so many choices.

7109
05:21:32,070 --> 05:21:33,310
It's so hard to pick.

7110
05:21:34,050 --> 05:21:37,530
I can now play like any... it's like you know when you can play any game you want now.

7111
05:21:37,710 --> 05:21:39,390
It's just like, what do I... what do I play?

7112
05:21:39,830 --> 05:21:43,450
It's like when you have so many choices, you don't know what choice to make.

7113
05:21:43,750 --> 05:21:44,330
Type deal.

7114
05:21:45,210 --> 05:21:46,650
But I'll think about it.

7115
05:21:46,770 --> 05:21:50,270
I don't know if I start... start with like the very... or I could play...

7116
05:21:50,270 --> 05:21:54,690
The reason why I haven't played Elden Ring yet is because everybody is playing Elden Ring.

7117
05:21:54,750 --> 05:21:57,070
Like everyone is playing Elden Ring.

7118
05:21:57,230 --> 05:21:58,690
And like I feel like everyone is playing Elden Ring.

7119
05:21:58,690 --> 05:22:00,370
Everyone is getting like Elden Ring fatigue.

7120
05:22:01,430 --> 05:22:09,210
Like every corporate Vtuber, every indie Vtuber, every flesh tuber, everybody is playing Elden Ring.

7121
05:22:10,330 --> 05:22:15,910
So I want to wait a little bit when... when things cool down a little bit.

7122
05:22:16,190 --> 05:22:23,270
Because I feel like you've watched people play it... fucking kill the same boss a hundred million times in the last two weeks now.

7123
05:22:23,530 --> 05:22:27,950
So that's why I've been like, alright I'm going to wait until like you know less people...

7124
05:22:28,690 --> 05:22:30,090
It's like super over saturated.

7125
05:22:30,390 --> 05:22:34,210
Yeah, it's super over... saturated.

7126
05:22:37,550 --> 05:22:39,030
So that's why I haven't touched it yet.

7127
05:22:39,090 --> 05:22:40,250
But definitely will in the future.

7128
05:22:40,350 --> 05:22:40,990
I promise you guys.

7129
05:22:41,090 --> 05:22:42,250
I mean it was a charity goal.

7130
05:22:42,350 --> 05:22:43,990
So I'll definitely do it in the future.

7131
05:22:44,170 --> 05:22:46,250
There's so many things I have to do in the future.

7132
05:22:51,290 --> 05:22:52,870
But yeah, it was great.

7133
05:22:53,030 --> 05:22:54,230
I had a great time.

7134
05:22:54,290 --> 05:22:57,610
Oh my gosh, it's been five... I've been streaming five hours and it's so long.

7135
05:22:57,610 --> 05:22:58,710
How about FPS?

7136
05:22:59,030 --> 05:23:00,610
I want... well FPS...

7137
05:23:01,150 --> 05:23:02,590
I want to try... what is it called?

7138
05:23:02,710 --> 05:23:03,690
Is it Trip Pan?

7139
05:23:05,490 --> 05:23:07,950
Let's see... is it Trip Pan 2?

7140
05:23:08,250 --> 05:23:09,250
I want to try that.

7141
05:23:09,510 --> 05:23:11,270
Apparently that game is really good.

7142
05:23:11,850 --> 05:23:13,350
I may try that game.

7143
05:23:13,470 --> 05:23:14,790
Maybe next... next week.

7144
05:23:15,010 --> 05:23:15,930
That's the...

7145
05:23:16,970 --> 05:23:19,210
Yeah, maybe next week I'll try that one.

7146
05:23:19,410 --> 05:23:21,210
That's something I've been thinking about too.

7147
05:23:22,350 --> 05:23:23,250
Is it good?

7148
05:23:23,390 --> 05:23:24,030
Is it really good?

7149
05:23:24,310 --> 05:23:25,930
I might do that next week actually.

7150
05:23:27,070 --> 05:23:30,470
If it's... if you guys think it's like worth it.

7151
05:23:30,930 --> 05:23:32,390
It has a lot of reviews.

7152
05:23:32,790 --> 05:23:33,850
I was looking through it.

7153
05:23:35,270 --> 05:23:37,810
I know it's a little spooky so...

7154
05:23:37,810 --> 05:23:38,730
So I don't know.

7155
05:23:39,130 --> 05:23:41,590
The only thing I'm worried about is that it is a little spooky.

7156
05:23:45,250 --> 05:23:45,610
Anyway.

7157
05:23:46,070 --> 05:23:48,410
Alright, I know I'm gonna call it here guys.

7158
05:23:48,930 --> 05:23:51,050
Because I do have a lot of behind the scenes work to do.

7159
05:23:51,350 --> 05:23:52,950
I really wish I could have talked to you guys more.

7160
05:23:53,010 --> 05:23:54,410
But don't worry, things are gonna cool down soon.

7161
05:23:54,470 --> 05:23:54,770
I swear.

7162
05:23:54,770 --> 05:23:59,750
After Anime Expo, things will definitely cool down a lot more now.

7163
05:24:00,010 --> 05:24:04,230
So... and I'll be able to actually hang out with you guys.

7164
05:24:04,350 --> 05:24:07,430
And have more like actual Zatsudon with all of you guys.

7165
05:24:08,490 --> 05:24:10,650
Post game Zatsudons again.

7166
05:24:10,890 --> 05:24:11,890
And Super Chat readings.

7167
05:24:12,590 --> 05:24:13,770
But thank you everybody.

7168
05:24:14,130 --> 05:24:17,850
I hope you guys enjoyed my very first time finishing a JRPG!

7169
05:24:19,070 --> 05:24:20,350
We should all be proud.

7170
05:24:20,510 --> 05:24:21,470
We stuck out.

7171
05:24:21,690 --> 05:24:23,210
We fucking did it guys.

7172
05:24:23,210 --> 05:24:25,730
We stuck it to the end.

7173
05:24:25,910 --> 05:24:28,130
Because I know Sadland was a lot.

7174
05:24:28,370 --> 05:24:32,290
But I'm so happy for all you Dragoons who stuck out to the very end.

7175
05:24:32,530 --> 05:24:35,890
To the last play through of Sadland.

7176
05:24:36,150 --> 05:24:37,670
We should all be proud of ourselves.

7177
05:24:37,950 --> 05:24:39,450
We all accomplished something today.

7178
05:24:40,250 --> 05:24:41,390
Gladstone, thank you for the Super Chat.

7179
05:24:41,470 --> 05:24:41,690
Thank you.

7180
05:24:41,750 --> 05:24:42,210
Thank you.

7181
05:24:42,230 --> 05:24:45,190
Do you think any of us Dragoons watch anyone else?

7182
05:24:45,250 --> 05:24:47,090
Sounds like someone's making excuses.

7183
05:24:47,730 --> 05:24:49,170
Thank you for the Super Chat.

7184
05:24:49,310 --> 05:24:49,710
Thank you.

7185
05:24:49,810 --> 05:24:50,230
Thank you.

7186
05:24:50,290 --> 05:24:52,050
No, it's not an excuse guys.

7187
05:24:53,830 --> 05:24:56,430
I hope you guys enjoy the new emotes everybody.

7188
05:24:57,110 --> 05:25:00,590
I'm slowly adding... I'm slowly commissioning more and more emotes now.

7189
05:25:02,490 --> 05:25:04,850
To fill up our slots.

7190
05:25:05,210 --> 05:25:05,790
So yeah.

7191
05:25:06,210 --> 05:25:09,630
Anyway guys, as always everybody stay hydrated.

7192
05:25:10,010 --> 05:25:10,650
Posture check.

7193
05:25:10,770 --> 05:25:12,570
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7194
05:25:12,710 --> 05:25:14,630
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

7195
05:25:14,750 --> 05:25:15,810
Because you deserve it.

7196
05:25:15,910 --> 05:25:16,890
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7197
05:25:17,870 --> 05:25:18,610
Bye everyone.

7198
05:25:19,330 --> 05:25:19,770
Bye.

7199
05:25:20,370 --> 05:25:21,790
JP, thank you for the Super Chat.

7200
05:25:21,890 --> 05:25:22,110
Thank you.

7201
05:25:22,150 --> 05:25:22,570
Thank you.

7202
05:25:22,570 --> 05:25:23,730
We were here till the end.

7203
05:25:23,870 --> 05:25:24,530
You were here.

7204
05:25:25,150 --> 05:25:25,810
Bye guys.

7205
05:25:26,050 --> 05:25:26,410
Bye.
