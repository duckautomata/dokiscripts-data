1
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh my god.

2
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,960
Hello, everybody.

3
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm not okay.

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,300
Okay, so they're drafting at the moment.

5
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,820
So it'll be a while before we actually get to play.

6
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,500
So we're gonna be here for a bit while we wait.

7
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,540
But I'm not okay.

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,800
I literally had like... Oh, did I do DVR?

9
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,800
Oh my gosh, this is how not okay I am.

10
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,020
This is... I am... Oh my gosh.

11
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,700
Okay, so... I had a crash out before the stream was starting.

12
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,480
But in a way where like I did two warm-up games and those two warm-up games, I had two players that were actively throwing my game.

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,140
And obviously, that wasn't so great.

14
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,940
I had two players that were actively throwing.

15
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,080
And it was terrible.

16
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
It was a terrible feeling because...

17
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,240
Because they're... I know like one of them is like well-known in the Marvel Rivals scene.

18
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,580
In the high elo scene.

19
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,800
And I was like, why are they throwing?

20
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,220
Why are they throwing my game?

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm trying to warm up.

22
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,340
This is my first warm-up game.

23
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,660
And then like I was like, is it me?

24
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,680
It's because they saw me in their game.

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
So they're throwing?

26
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,940
Because they were playing the game earlier.

27
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,160
And then they... And then stream mode came off.

28
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,100
And then they started throwing.

29
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,140
Is it me?

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,120
And then I couldn't tell.

31
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,280
I couldn't tell if it was me or it's like they were just throwing for fun.

32
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,900
And...

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,240
I was two games away from Celestio 2.

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,740
And now I'm two games off from...

35
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,340
I'm now I'm four games off from Celestio 2.

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,220
And I had such a high win rate too.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,540
I like...

38
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,460
I lost only five games on Luna Snow.

39
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,300
And three games on Sue.

40
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,060
That's different now.

41
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,980
That's...

42
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,280
My win rate was so high.

43
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,460
And then my second game...

44
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,260
My second game...

45
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,760
I was up...

46
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,000
My DPS were not having a good day.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,700
And I was already not having a good day.

48
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,540
And I was like, oh, they're gonna do the draft thing right now.

49
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:08,820
And...

50
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,560
So it was a great start of the day.

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,160
You know?

52
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,100
Like...

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,620
At the start, I was like, oh my god.

54
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,800
If I can't perform in rank...

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,240
What if I can't perform in the tournament?

56
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,540
So like...

57
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,140
That was my thought process going in.

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,180
Also, I'm really nervous and shy right now.

59
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,380
Also...

60
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,860
Like...

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,320
I think...

62
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
I don't know if I can...

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,720
Like...

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,140
Actually...

65
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,140
I'm scared to interact.

66
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,180
Because there's a lot...

67
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,260
Really big content creators going in.

68
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,000
So like...

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,080
I think the Shroud X team was actually just like...

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,580
We're like...

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,200
Substitute for people that were like...

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,020
Gonna back out.

73
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,880
Because it's gonna be like...

74
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,860
Mostly streamers.

75
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,000
This time for real.

76
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,380
But like...

77
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,800
Uh...

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,640
Because like...

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,060
Um...

80
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,280
They were just there as like...

81
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,020
Alternatives slash substitutes.

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,140
But no one backed out.

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,980
Um...

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,620
And then...

85
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,160
So then I was like...

86
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,220
Alright, let's look at the draft pick.

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,800
So...

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,220
Um...

89
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,640
When they asked for my rank...

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,780
I said Eternity.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,720
Because...

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,500
I was like...

93
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,220
I'm not gonna say higher.

94
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,060
Because I know people who's gonna end up being in the tournament.

95
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,520
And like...

96
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,340
I...

97
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,460
I was like...

98
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,180
I don't think that I...

99
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,820
I play good enough...

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,120
To...

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Um...

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,820
To be like...

103
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,560
In that category.

104
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,540
When all of them are mostly tanks and DPS.

105
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,140
Other than ML7.

106
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,260
ML7 is like the only support...

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,860
Other support in the higher...

108
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,640
Higher elo.

109
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,560
So like...

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,900
I was like...

111
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,300
I'm not gonna put myself...

112
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,380
In that category.

113
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,760
With ML7.

114
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,720
Because like...

115
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
There's literally only...

116
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,940
Two supports.

117
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,760
Me and ML7.

118
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,180
That's in the higher elo.

119
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,100
And I was like...

120
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm not ML7.

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Like...

122
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,840
I know.

123
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,160
So I put myself as...

124
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,800
Eternity.

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,040
And then...

126
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,840
And then...

127
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,560
I saw the draft pick...

128
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,900
And they put me...

129
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,260
On second round...

130
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,160
Draft pick.

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,120
So like...

132
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,440
Obviously after the first round...

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,360
They go to second round.

134
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,180
And...

135
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm the only support in

136
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:04,910
this...

137
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,050
Who's gonna pick me up?

138
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,770
Noko is in a lower tier than me.

139
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,950
That fucker...

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm the only...

141
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,440
You know how I know

142
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,500
500.

143
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,680
I...

144
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
He put himself as...

145
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,660
Grandmaster.

146
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:27,880
I...

147
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,180
But he's still...

148
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,520
He's still in second round pick.

149
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,420
He put himself as...

150
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:35,980
Grandmaster.

151
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,840
I know he's Eternity.

152
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
Because Gomez went on...

153
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,820
Ulti down to play with him.

154
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,000
To be an Eternity.

155
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,310
Like...

156
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,120
They said what our peak rank was...

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
But like...

158
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,660
Noko is still in...

159
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,160
Um...

160
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,520
Uh...

161
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
Noko is still in...

162
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,060
Uh...

163
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,500
But he's a DPS player.

164
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,200
He's a DPS player.

165
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,400
So...

166
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,160
So...

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,980
They still put him in second round.

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,660
But they're still gonna pick Noko over me...

169
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,600
Because he's a DPS player.

170
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Like...

171
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,420
That's the thing.

172
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,260
He has more impact in the game than I do.

173
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,780
That's...

174
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,040
I wasn't even being honest either.

175
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,260
I said Eternity.

176
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,500
Because technically...

177
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,340
I am an Eternity.

178
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,280
Like...

179
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,600
Technically...

180
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,380
One above all...

181
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,600
Is an Eternity.

182
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
If you think about it.

183
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,020
And I wasn't...

184
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,220
I wasn't one above all last season.

185
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,980
Thanks for the crash on ASMR.

186
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,660
A perfect way...

187
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,520
To start my evening.

188
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,740
Thank you for the Super Chat hat.

189
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,240
Thank you.

190
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,800
Thank you.

191
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,680
But I'm still in the second category.

192
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,220
I'm still...

193
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,340
And I'm the only support...

194
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,500
In that category.

195
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,660
I'm so sad.

196
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,220
I'm...

197
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm...

198
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm...

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:08,820
I'm...

200
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm...

201
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,040
I tried so hard...

202
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,600
To not fall into that...

203
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,540
Loop that area again.

204
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,380
No matter what I do...

205
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm in that category.

206
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,500
I tried so hard...

207
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,960
To not be in there.

208
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,900
I...

209
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,360
I...

210
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,240
This is...

211
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,140
It's actually...

212
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,520
Alright.

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,260
Anyone know?

214
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,820
Well...

215
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,020
XTC just woke up.

216
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,320
Because he sort of overslept.

217
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,260
So people are just waiting...

218
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,020
For the draft pick to start out.

219
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,560
Um...

220
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,960
So I'm just waiting on that.

221
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
It doesn't matter.

222
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,840
In the end...

223
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,120
I accept my fate.

224
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,520
Oh my god.

225
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,520
So I'm gonna go in with a...

226
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,220
For fun can do attitude.

227
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,380
I've already...

228
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,600
I've already got crushed from...

229
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,160
Don't worry.

230
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,280
My...

231
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,320
My spirits have already been crushed in rank.

232
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,480
So...

233
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,500
So...

234
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,180
Seeing me on the draft pick category...

235
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,960
Has...

236
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,360
Seeing where I'm at...

237
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,140
At the draft pick category...

238
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,500
Has already...

239
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,120
You know...

240
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,720
It's like...

241
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,160
You know...

242
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,140
I'm on the ground...

243
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,740
Curled up.

244
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,700
And then the draft pick category...

245
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,220
Showed up.

246
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,080
And just spit on my...

247
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,940
Dead body.

248
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,940
And...

249
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,260
Just spit on my dead body...

250
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,140
And then gave one last kick...

251
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,800
To it.

252
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,540
Um...

253
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,940
But that's basically it.

254
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,280
I don't... I don't feel so good.

255
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,940
Stop, she's already dead.

256
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,660
You know, I went to play... I went to play... I thought playing rank would be like, I'm gonna go warm up.

257
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,520
Just, you know, try and see... get myself into that groove.

258
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,840
Just warm up so I can mechanically... I...

259
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,420
mechanically, I'll feel, like, you know, okay about myself.

260
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:28,540
Now I wish I didn't go into that warm up because I'm going... I... Those two warm up rank games... fucking destroyed me.

261
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:36,840
Like... It destroyed my mental... and it only took two games.

262
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,720
It only took me two games... to fucking destroy me as a person.

263
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,700
And...

264
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,700
But hey, if I crash out now... that means... if I crash out now... that means I won't crash out later.

265
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,500
I used up my crash out quota.

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,860
Chat... Yeah, I can't crash out if I already feel like I'm at the bottom.

267
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,580
Exactly!

268
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,540
Exactly!

269
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,660
It's all planned.

270
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,760
I... It can't go get worse.

271
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,720
Like, I know what I'm in for now.

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,500
I...

273
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,800
Yeah, exactly!

274
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,420
It means it just gets better... from here.

275
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,520
Exactly, guys!

276
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,220
No, don't say that...

277
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,220
There's a lot a really big content creators here.

278
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,180
I don't wanna... I don't wanna...

279
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,040
I don't wanna be part of the problem.

280
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:42,680
myösh uvaifu hoffeu I don't wanna be part of the problem, guys...

281
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,240
Please...

282
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,680
Alright.

283
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,040
I mean, I could warm up in Quick Play.

284
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,980
I mean, yeah, I guess I could.

285
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm not going back to rank after today.

286
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm not going back to rank.

287
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,800
It was already enough for me.

288
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,580
It was not the best of times.

289
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,760
Alright, let me adjust my game audio real quick.

290
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,040
Alright.

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,120
I don't know how long Quick Play is going to be.

292
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,860
So we might as well do a little warm up in between.

293
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,280
If I can find it.

294
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
There it is.

295
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,980
Alright, let's boot up the game.

296
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,060
If I crash out now, there's no way I'll find a shovel to make it worse.

297
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,020
There's no way.

298
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,420
Everything will be okay.

299
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,140
Everything will be...

300
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,700
Everything will be...

301
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,640
We'll be okay!

302
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,300
No matter what team I'm on.

303
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,240
Everything will be okay.

304
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,820
Vibes!

305
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,980
Fun time!

306
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,840
Enjoy yourself, Toki!

307
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,140
I already feel like I'm in rock bottom.

308
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,400
So surely...

309
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,460
Surely I can't feel worse.

310
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,080
Alright.

311
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,080
Going in there with the most fun attitude in the whole world.

312
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,650
Oh, why did I... God, why didn't I say Grand Master?

313
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,410
What?

314
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,070
If Noko can say Grand Master, I should be allowed to say Grand Master!

315
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,510
Just... Minus two rigs for me.

316
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,610
Alright.

317
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,710
If only... Alright, Quick Play.

318
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,310
Might as well have fun.

319
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,970
Might as well say I'm... Okay, I think if I say I'm Diamond, then like...

320
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,610
People would actually sort of... Would get suspicious.

321
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:02,670
I...

322
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,350
No!

323
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,590
There's no way!

324
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,890
Because there were other people that were...

325
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,330
That were also...

326
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:12,730
Um...

327
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,150
They were also like...

328
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,790
Oh my god, I bet you my team's gonna be the only team that's three support players.

329
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,110
I... Okay, no, Toki.

330
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,730
Don't manifest destiny.

331
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,850
Guys, do not manifest destiny, Toki.

332
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,290
If it happens, it happens.

333
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,410
Not because you, like, told God to let that happen to you.

334
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,410
Like...

335
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,130
If it happens, it happens.

336
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,310
Don't make it happen.

337
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,970
I should... You're right.

338
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,310
I should have applied to be a...

339
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,130
I just... I should apply it as Phil Unranked.

340
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,930
30 seconds before you attack.

341
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,730
Get ready.

342
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,270
Don't give God a prank ideas.

343
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,830
I hate...

344
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,030
Oh my god.

345
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,730
Oh my god, I'm playing Team Fortress 2 right now.

346
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,830
I don't.

347
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,530
No.

348
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,870
What is this?

349
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,610
I'm going back.

350
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,450
I'm just... I'm not okay.

351
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,210
The battle starts in battle.

352
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,650
Okay.

353
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,690
The battle starts in battle.

354
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,850
Four, three...

355
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,490
No, it's not.

356
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,410
I don't feel like I'm me right now.

357
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,490
I mean...

358
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,230
Mentally and physically, I do not feel like I'm me at the moment.

359
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,310
Okay.

360
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,730
I don't use Quick Play as warm-up because, like, people who move in Quick Play are not real.

361
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,450
That's why, like...

362
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,030
Like, it's actually crazy, like, the amount of...

363
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,410
Because, like, the amount of skill-wise...

364
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,390
I swear to God, if...

365
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,250
I swear to God, if...

366
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,030
I swear to God, that was, like, such a sick freeze.

367
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,410
If nobody kills him, I...

368
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,250
And I die, I swear to God, I leave this team.

369
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,730
I will willingly leave this game if all of that has happened.

370
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,170
I won't leave now because I live.

371
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,110
Because I lived, I will not leave.

372
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,910
I swear to God, Loki.

373
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,110
I swear to God.

374
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,630
I'm right in front of you!

375
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,910
I'm right in front of you!

376
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,810
Oh!

377
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:20,950
Oh!

378
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,830
What the...

379
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,330
What the fuck?

380
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,330
Oh my God!

381
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,810
Okay.

382
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,830
Crash out now so I can't crash out in the tournament.

383
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,190
Okay, I will take the five-minute ban because even after five minutes, we won't have the crap.

384
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,670
They're still gonna be doing draft.

385
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,810
That's actually crazy.

386
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,530
I was right in front of him.

387
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,030
Like, that's actually, like, next skill.

388
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,930
What elo are you?

389
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,670
I will look up what your elo is.

390
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,010
Oh, that's bad.

391
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,310
I thought our Loki would heal.

392
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,390
But, like, you know, sometimes thinking is not right.

393
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,590
Okay.

394
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,490
Alright.

395
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,250
Alright.

396
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,830
Thor just disappeared.

397
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,090
Oh.

398
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,530
Nobody's gonna...

399
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,470
I guess I'll die.

400
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,650
I guess I'll die.

401
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,430
I guess I'll die in this.

402
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:15,950
Bro.

403
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:26,930
You see, if this was ranked, the gameplay will improve, but my mental will not.

404
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,650
Just so you know.

405
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,030
Nothing will change.

406
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,530
My mental will still stay the same.

407
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,230
But at least I won't lose elo for it.

408
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,090
You know?

409
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,490
It's all about not losing your elo at this point.

410
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,190
I knew I should've.

411
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,150
I...

412
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,010
Okay.

413
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,090
Okay.

414
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,320
Please, at least kill him.

415
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,720
Please.

416
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,220
Okay, that's good.

417
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,840
That's good.

418
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,620
He killed him.

419
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,560
Please, at least kill him.

420
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,580
Please.

421
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,260
Oh, okay.

422
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,700
I get solo ulti too?

423
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,080
Dude, that's cool.

424
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm not playing Luna.

425
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,820
I'm not playing Luna.

426
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,140
This is when I learned that they do not deserve Luna.

427
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,000
At least I can be invisible.

428
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,620
That's all I care.

429
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,960
There we go.

430
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,780
They don't deserve Luna at this point.

431
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,840
Guys, I still need a warm-up.

432
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,680
Despite everything I say, I still need a warm-up.

433
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,560
At least I can sort of heal myself.

434
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,540
And I can go up... I can disappear.

435
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,800
Alright.

436
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,200
Guys, are they smart enough to hit this?

437
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,000
They are not.

438
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,240
But that's okay.

439
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,200
I still... Oh my gosh.

440
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,900
I still can't believe that the Loki looked at me.

441
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,420
And... Loki, please, for the love of God.

442
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,160
How are you a real person?

443
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,280
That's actually crazy.

444
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,560
Oh, unlucky.

445
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,320
I'll stay here, though.

446
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,420
Oh, he just dashes.

447
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,740
Alright.

448
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,720
Okay.

449
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,080
Okay.

450
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,680
Okay.

451
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,040
Never mind.

452
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,740
I know what kind... I know what player he is.

453
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,040
Never mind.

454
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,700
That's unlucky.

455
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,760
I don't have shields.

456
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,300
I wish I did, but I had to use it to heal as the only support, technically, around.

457
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,900
Oh, unlucky.

458
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,920
Alright.

459
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,260
Alright.

460
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm gonna be invisible, so...

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,560
You know what?

462
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,320
I'll heal you, because I am a good person.

463
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,300
Wow.

464
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,320
What?

465
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,240
Oh my god.

466
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,400
You see that?

467
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,000
That's what it's like to heal.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,520
Wow.

469
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,960
Wow.

470
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,740
Isn't that cool?

471
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,000
That's what it's like to have a teammate that can...

472
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,740
That can heal for you.

473
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,980
Holy fuck.

474
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,400
What a unique concept in general.

475
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,940
It's fine.

476
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,780
Oh, it's not fine.

477
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,880
It's not fine, actually.

478
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Take notes.

479
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,920
There's a guy floating above us.

480
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Oh, goodbye, the guy floating above us.

481
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,040
Okay.

482
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,460
I wanted to do something a little cheeky, but I guess...

483
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Alright, everybody's gonna die here.

484
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,460
Wait, what?

485
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,520
Oh my god, he went to the left.

486
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,480
I was like...

487
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,680
Is he actually gonna go towards me?

488
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,660
Fucking freak.

489
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,240
I wish I was low-key.

490
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,480
I want to take this character away from that man.

491
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,660
I want to take it away from me.

492
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,940
I just don't want him to use it anymore.

493
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,940
I just...

494
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Like, for the sake of humanity...

495
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,420
He needs to be...

496
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,140
He needs to not use this character.

497
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,520
Wait, did our...

498
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,100
Okay.

499
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Alright, nice.

500
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
Look at that.

501
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,660
I peeled...

502
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,840
Well, not peeled.

503
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,940
I helped my support.

504
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,680
That's a crazy con...

505
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,380
Oh, he's...

506
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,840
He's shielded.

507
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,360
I...

508
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh my god.

509
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,420
This is the first time I've ever seen him actually.

510
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,020
Oh my god.

511
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,620
That's crazy.

512
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,900
He copied a support.

513
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,340
That's actually crazy.

514
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,760
And we did nothing with it.

515
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,340
What an incredibly...

516
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,460
Oh my god.

517
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,300
We didn't even kill him.

518
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,860
We didn't even kill him.

519
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm so sad.

520
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm so...

521
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,720
It still went towards me.

522
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,320
It, like, ricocheted off of me.

523
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,560
I don't think he's gonna get a kill.

524
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,220
I did not mean to push him.

525
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,040
I panicked.

526
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,520
Oh, the look!

527
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,940
He brought the Emma to me!

528
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,480
I can't believe it.

529
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,680
I can't believe the look.

530
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,940
He brought him over.

531
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,860
I...

532
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,000
I...

533
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,430
Oh...

534
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,460
Oh my god.

535
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,800
Oh my god.

536
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
God, I missed shit.

537
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,940
What the fuck was he doing?

538
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,320
Alright.

539
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,520
I mean, it was lost.

540
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,460
So I might as well have some fun by killing someone.

541
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,560
Pick your hero.

542
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,040
Super drafted me?

543
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,720
Wait!

544
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,480
Was I last pick?

545
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,580
Was I...

546
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,420
Was I last pick, guys?

547
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,960
Was I...

548
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,820
I just need to know.

549
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,020
Not last!

550
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,100
Let's go!

551
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,440
Let's go!

552
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,560
Let's go!

553
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,320
We're not last pick!

554
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,060
We're not last pick!

555
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,280
Crash out potentially avoided!

556
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,620
Let's second go!

557
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,080
My crash out was potentially avoided, guys!

558
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,360
Guys!

559
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,220
Woo!

560
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,320
Crisis averted.

561
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,060
Thank god.

562
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,500
That's the best news I've heard all day.

563
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,140
Not last pick.

564
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,000
Not the last kid in the playground.

565
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,620
Let's fucking go!

566
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,700
Alright, I'm motivated now.

567
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,420
Let's win this.

568
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,980
That's all it takes.

569
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,080
That's all it takes.

570
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,780
My rollercoaster of emotions.

571
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,940
I'm okay now.

572
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,460
I don't need therapy anymore.

573
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,940
Therapist, I wasn't last pick.

574
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,200
It's time to end it.

575
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
Let's go.

576
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,160
Let's do this.

577
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,680
Who needs therapy?

578
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,940
I wasn't last picked on the playground.

579
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm feeling it now.

580
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,300
I'm a simp...

581
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,960
Oh, fuck!

582
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,680
I'm quite low-key.

583
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm...

584
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,420
I gotta talk to my therapist later today.

585
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,360
It's so over.

586
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,560
I...

587
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,000
I...

588
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,640
I knew feeling hope was a mistake.

589
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,840
I...

590
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,380
I fucking knew it.

591
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,860
Why did I ever feel hope?

592
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,840
I...

593
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Oh, you are a fucker!

594
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,800
You are...

595
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,360
You are...

596
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,140
I knew it.

597
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,380
There was no reason to ever feel hope.

598
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,300
That was so short-lived.

599
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,780
Did you not see what happened to me?!

600
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,120
This could happen to...

601
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,840
This could happen to you, too.

602
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,840
The immediate regret.

603
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,020
At least somebody get rid of the Spider-Man.

604
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't want that to happen to me again.

605
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,610
Jesus!

606
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,370
Please!

607
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,610
I'm right here!

608
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,430
I could have saved you!

609
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,450
Oh my god!

610
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,830
I don't know why my DPS are scared.

611
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:48,850
Okay.

612
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,130
I love Quick Play.

613
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,050
Doki, the last hope...

614
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,750
The last hope has died.

615
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,070
It has...

616
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,490
It has sadly...

617
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,470
My childlike wonder is gone.

618
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,430
I have...

619
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,670
I realized what it was like in the real world.

620
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,090
Oh my god!

621
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,130
And her ult gets cancelled by Spider-Man!

622
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,850
Go Spider-Man!

623
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:20,830
Go, I guess!

624
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:22,870
Please!

625
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,290
That's very sad.

626
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,170
Oh my god!

627
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:32,750
I couldn't.

628
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,590
I didn't have shift.

629
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,750
I didn't have shift.

630
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,650
My childlike wonder and Wizzy is gone.

631
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,130
Wait!

632
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,630
Rocket!

633
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,390
Oh!

634
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:43,850
Rocket!

635
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,190
Oh!

636
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,170
Rocket!

637
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,350
Rocket!

638
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,230
Rocket!

639
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,650
Rocket, please!

640
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:48,990
Rocket!

641
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,470
You still have ult!

642
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,430
Oh, there he is.

643
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,490
He ulted it when...

644
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,490
There's two of them left.

645
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,970
That's my rocket!

646
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,490
Let's go!

647
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,910
That's him!

648
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,250
Oh my gosh.

649
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,010
Okay.

650
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:00,930
My...

651
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,430
That's fine!

652
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,490
Let's put this right here too!

653
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,810
That's bait!

654
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,310
Alright.

655
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:13,810
Don't worry.

656
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,170
We will not heal each other.

657
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,650
He's a menace.

658
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,070
He truly is.

659
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,590
He truly is a menace.

660
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,330
Maybe I can go sue.

661
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,370
I need to practice sue anyway.

662
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,750
Yippee!

663
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,190
I'm out of Rocket was doing the shimmy.

664
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,470
He is dead.

665
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,310
He is...

666
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,550
He is dead.

667
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,630
They're going dive in quick...

668
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,310
Oh my god.

669
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,570
You have no mom.

670
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,010
Who the f...

671
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,930
They're going dive in quick blurt.

672
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,650
Your mother does not love you, so this is the only way to feel love.

673
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,510
Kill my...

674
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,610
I'm in...

675
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,490
I'm in...

676
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,090
I'm in quick play.

677
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,030
I...

678
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,590
I'm just happy I'm not last pick, guys.

679
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,730
I'm just...

680
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,590
That's my only joy in life right today.

681
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:12,970
Today's...

682
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,330
Dear Therapist.

683
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,710
Today I wasn't last picked on the playground.

684
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,550
I still crashed out in quick play though.

685
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,310
But at least I wasn't last picked!

686
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,230
Ha ha ha ha ha.

687
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,970
God damn.

688
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,890
I suppose you've made quite a name for yourself.

689
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,130
And a pretty penny as well.

690
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,450
I fight...

691
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,390
Bro, this line up is...

692
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,390
What?

693
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,570
The battle starts in five...

694
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:41,990
Four...

695
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,190
Three...

696
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,890
Two...

697
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,790
Wait, was I?

698
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,350
Who?

699
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,090
Who almost first picked me?

700
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:47,650
Got it?

701
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,730
That's crazy.

702
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,870
I did not think that I would ever be first picked.

703
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,110
Ha ha ha.

704
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,170
That is crazy.

705
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,250
Ha ha ha.

706
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,790
That is crazy.

707
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,330
Wait, XQC almost first picked me?

708
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,370
Ha ha ha.

709
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,830
I'm so surprised.

710
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:00,830
I don't think...

711
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,390
I never...

712
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,310
I personally didn't think I was that good.

713
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,490
So, I really appreciate it.

714
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:06,890
Oh my god.

715
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:07,890
Validation.

716
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,470
You know what?

717
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:08,730
No.

718
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,370
Fuck yeah.

719
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:10,970
Rocket!

720
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,110
Why?!

721
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,330
Why?!

722
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,870
Now the shield is so far!

723
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,430
Here!

724
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,050
All you have to do is play on my shield!

725
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,550
Rocket!

726
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,490
He's...

727
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,350
The shield is so far in the sky now!

728
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,270
Thank you guys for thinking that I'm good.

729
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,670
I really appreciate it.

730
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,710
Rocket, I really...

731
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,030
Please.

732
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,490
Like, literally, we have the shield.

733
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,690
I have to recharge my shield though.

734
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,960
That's a really famous...

735
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,180
Like...

736
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,060
That's a question for all ages.

737
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,200
Rocket, why?

738
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,520
I...

739
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:52,740
I...

740
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,740
I'm happy that people think I'm good enough to be first pick.

741
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,140
That actually makes me happy.

742
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,700
You know what?

743
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,400
No!

744
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,680
Doki, go in there!

745
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,160
Today's a joyous day!

746
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,140
You were almost first pick, Doki.

747
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,860
You should be happy about that.

748
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,900
There is 20 million people on my ass right now.

749
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,140
Oh my god.

750
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,640
Okay.

751
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,620
Jesus Christ.

752
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,700
Guys.

753
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,960
Confidence.

754
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,320
I feel so confident right now.

755
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,000
It's a jolly good day.

756
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,080
First pick, Doki.

757
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,440
Almost first pick, Doki.

758
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,600
That is a fucking support!

759
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,760
Let's fucking go!

760
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,080
Let's...

761
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,540
Oh my god!

762
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,740
And I get Tyler!

763
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,540
What?!

764
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,680
Let's go!

765
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,310
I mean, the only way to get not harassed by Spider-Man is to have a decent team support duo.

766
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,870
But like, I don't think that's it.

767
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,950
I am...

768
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,950
My raccoon is playing like he...

769
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,690
My rocket is playing as if he doesn't trust...

770
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,870
He doesn't trust me as...

771
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,030
As a support.

772
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,130
Like, he doesn't trust me as a support duo.

773
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,590
So he like...

774
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,430
He's running away from me.

775
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,050
But the whole thing about Dive is that we have to heal each other.

776
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,770
But my rocket keeps running away from me.

777
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,910
So like, I...

778
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,710
Like, I...

779
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,350
What do I do?

780
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,230
There's like nothing you can really do in that situation at this point.

781
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,770
Oh, that's unlucky.

782
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,830
I tried to save him.

783
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,230
Oh.

784
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,470
I fucking knew it.

785
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,190
Um, I don't know why he stood there, but that's alright.

786
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,190
Like...

787
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:44,430
Like...

788
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,150
Rocket.

789
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,150
Here you go.

790
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,170
Let's fight together.

791
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,390
See, you see this guy?

792
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,330
You see that guy?

793
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:50,790
Yeah.

794
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,970
Now we get to live together.

795
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,310
What is it?

796
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,130
Okay, Rocket.

797
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,070
You see this guy?

798
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,930
Let's keep each other alive.

799
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,650
And then look at that.

800
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,730
We're alive.

801
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,950
Okay.

802
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,930
I don't have my shield.

803
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,670
We're gonna die.

804
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,090
I'm sorry, Rocket.

805
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,030
I am...

806
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,050
I'm not gonna be help.

807
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,530
Oh, wait, no.

808
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,370
My shield's back now.

809
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,110
Don't worry, guys.

810
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,630
My shield's back.

811
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,630
There we go.

812
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,310
That's fine.

813
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,890
That's okay.

814
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,970
Yeah, my Namor was, like, so done with dive.

815
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,930
Which is understandable, like, anybody would be.

816
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,950
Okay.

817
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,070
See that, Rocket?

818
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,290
We fight together.

819
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,230
You see that?

820
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,270
We have...

821
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,190
Okay, Rocket.

822
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:37,490
Yeah.

823
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,390
Let's run away from me again.

824
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,370
Yes.

825
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,610
Let's not support each other.

826
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,290
Guys.

827
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,630
Oh my god.

828
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,210
Oh, where's my...

829
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,790
Oh, I was up in the air for too long.

830
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,490
Oh my god.

831
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,330
Teamwork makes the team work.

832
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,530
I played against dive so much that, like...

833
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,010
It's so hard to see another support that doesn't help me.

834
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,970
But it's quick play, so, like, what can I expect?

835
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,330
I expect too much out of these players in quick play.

836
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:17,450
Like...

837
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,790
But that's, like, the only way to counter dive as the other support player.

838
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:21,950
Because...

839
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,170
Jesus.

840
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,070
Goodbye, Hulk.

841
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,290
Oh my god.

842
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:28,830
Guys.

843
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,490
Guys.

844
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,650
We do not have to do all of that.

845
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:32,650
Oh my god.

846
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,270
Rocket, please.

847
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,490
Rocket, please.

848
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,970
Oh my god.

849
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,210
Oh, I did not want to use that.

850
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,970
It's fine.

851
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,610
There you go.

852
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,370
That sucks.

853
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,670
I didn't want to use that though.

854
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,370
But, like, what else was I supposed to do?

855
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,430
Oh, this is where I die.

856
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,770
Oh, I can't get my shield.

857
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,450
Oh.

858
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,090
That sucks.

859
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,150
My...

860
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,850
Rocket didn't care.

861
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,210
I should have played low-key.

862
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,640
It's too far.

863
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,740
It's just too far.

864
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,160
It's the GGs here.

865
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,340
Oh.

866
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,400
Rocket's just chillin'.

867
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,680
I mean,

868
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,940
they want dive in Quick Play.

869
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,500
What do they want from...

870
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,580
They want...

871
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,920
They want dive in Quick Play.

872
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
What do they want?

873
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,910
Like, how do we get out of that?

874
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,940
One not allowed.

875
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,620
How is...

876
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,800
How does Quick Play dive every game?

877
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,440
How do you have fun...

878
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,980
I guess it's fun to kill people over and over again.

879
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,800
I mean, I can leave Quick Play.

880
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,420
It's Quick Play.

881
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,260
And it's just five minutes.

882
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,820
You'll need a top-notch team...

883
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,360
Oh, wait.

884
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,840
Who has a really stacked team?

885
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,920
They have J3 and Flats.

886
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,780
We have Super and...

887
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,400
Gale.

888
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,620
We have...

889
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,820
If we're comparing like...

890
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:59,520
stacked players, both Super and Gale have both been in 1 above all.

891
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,580
What the heck is going on?

892
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:18,700
Okay, I'm... I don't... What is going on in my jacket?

893
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,820
Oh, drafts are finished?

894
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,800
Oh, okay.

895
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,180
Alright, leaving... Okay, if drafts are finished, I should leave now.

896
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,140
Just to be prepared.

897
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Oh, I... Yeah, I get a pass!

898
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,300
I get a pass!

899
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,180
Okay, guys, we're going in.

900
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,240
Where is... I'm not last pick, guys.

901
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm so happy.

902
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,690
Hello, everyone!

903
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:55,990
Hello!

904
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,890
No, I actually think this is a good team.

905
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,930
I'm gonna be honest.

906
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,570
I don't see how we lose this.

907
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:02,730
Yeah, for sure.

908
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,370
Actually...

909
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,430
Okay, so... I need to adjust my stuff real fast.

910
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,050
I play Viper, and I play Venom, and I play Hulk only.

911
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,150
Okay, uh... That's good, actually.

912
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,710
Let me adjust my Discord stuff.

913
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,910
They're both good, so... No, Venom's broken.

914
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,410
Yeah, no, and if you do go Hulk, I'll go Namor for the team up.

915
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,210
Okay... I don't know who the hell that is.

916
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,050
This is my Discord.

917
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,510
Wait, what characters do you know?

918
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,110
I know Marvel.

919
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,370
I'm a big Marvel fan.

920
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,410
Clearly not, but...

921
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,370
I mean...

922
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,150
Who's Namor?

923
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,470
It's like a...

924
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:41,890
Who's Namor?

925
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:42,450
It's like a...

926
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,130
D-rated to be champ or hero for sure.

927
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,250
No, he's really good with the team up.

928
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,250
He's the guy that throws the squids down.

929
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,430
He throws like the tridents.

930
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,210
That's... that's Namor.

931
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,310
Yeah.

932
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,710
Does anyone play Groot?

933
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,970
I... I... I... I... I play the raccoon guy.

934
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,350
Um... and it's really cool when...

935
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,410
When I can ride around on Groot.

936
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,170
Well, I mean, if Gale goes Punisher, that could be a big play, actually.

937
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,110
Depends, depends.

938
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,190
I was... I was thinking about this.

939
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,130
So, my only issue with Punisher is that, like, if these teammates...

940
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,370
Sorry, if our enemies know what to do, like, Punisher's is really predictable.

941
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,870
If they go, like, a certain comp, like, I'm just...

942
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,570
Honestly, I just picked you because I know you play DPS a lot.

943
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,890
I can play so much.

944
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,290
Yeah, no, I can do whatever we need.

945
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,110
I can lock it in.

946
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,650
I mean, for sure, if we get...

947
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,690
If we get res comp, we play res comp every time, by the way.

948
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:35,670
It's just too good.

949
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:35,830
Sure.

950
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,870
Yeah, I agree.

951
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,250
Adam Starlet open, we always play.

952
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,050
I can play Adam for us.

953
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,450
If they don't ban Adam, we're going Adam.

954
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,170
Adam Warlock?

955
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,530
Yeah, Adam Warlock, you know from Guardians of the Galaxy?

956
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:49,970
No, that's Chatham.

957
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,290
Holy.

958
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,690
Guys, I played a lot of Overwatch and I was extremely good at that.

959
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:56,590
Wait, what rank?

960
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,610
I hate to break it to you, I don't think that's true.

961
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,070
I was diamond in beta.

962
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,310
Ooh.

963
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,350
What happened after that?

964
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,590
I don't...

965
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,790
I have a Genji montage on me, dumbass.

966
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,810
Yeah, I've seen it, bro.

967
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,690
It's not the most impressive.

968
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,470
I hate to break it to you.

969
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,830
It was at the time.

970
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,130
Oh, brother.

971
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,570
How do we pull that up right now?

972
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:23,250
What?

973
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:24,550
What?

974
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,130
What?

975
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,590
Palor won the best Genji in the world.

976
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,090
Wait, is that your actual diamond?

977
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:32,930
Really quick.

978
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,690
Guys, Super, do you mind just adding Kitty House Sniff?

979
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,050
I think I did.

980
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,230
Yeah, I did.

981
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:39,470
I did.

982
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:39,690
I did.

983
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,890
Okay, cool.

984
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:41,350
Thank you.

985
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,050
Yep.

986
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,790
Alright, so do we need to be logged on for this?

987
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,150
I should do that, bro.

988
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,990
Log in.

989
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:49,770
Marvel Rivals.

990
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,770
Yep, yep.

991
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,310
You killed your diamond 3 account.

992
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,670
I don't play on this account.

993
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,170
I know you're not gonna use your Ryan Gosling.

994
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,070
You know what I mean?

995
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:00,670
No.

996
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,710
Listen, people will be like, who the fuck is Ryan Gosling if they see this shit?

997
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,800
For some reason, my thing is not moving up and down and I don't know how to fix it.

998
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,540
But like, it's fine.

999
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,400
You guys can see.

1000
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
You guys can see who's talking.

1001
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,340
See, I'm not gonna crash out, guys.

1002
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,840
I'm not.

1003
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,080
See, guys?

1004
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,840
I can't crash out with this team.

1005
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,360
If anybody, Tyler1 will crash out first before me.

1006
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,520
At least I'll have that.

1007
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,340
At least.

1008
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,500
At least.

1009
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,640
At least.

1010
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,260
At least.

1011
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,320
He'll crash out before I crash out.

1012
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,480
Oh, nice.

1013
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:40,960
Patek.

1014
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:41,800
Mm-hmm.

1015
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,310
I'll take that to my grave.

1016
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,550
The moment he crashes out, I have permission to start crashing out.

1017
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,590
Also, I need to make my push to talk, like push to mute thing.

1018
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,660
I'm fixing my push to mute.

1019
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,700
Oh, so I don't have to worry.

1020
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,540
How many rolls are there?

1021
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,720
What do you mean?

1022
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,980
There's tanks, DPS, support.

1023
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,980
Yeah, but how many tanks are on a team?

1024
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,040
Usually it's like 2-2-2, but it's 2-2-2 generally.

1025
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,840
Who else plays tank here?

1026
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:35,580
Me.

1027
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:35,900
I do.

1028
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,080
Oh, that's why you got jealous when I called you out for being dog shit.

1029
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,320
Okay, well, let's relax here for a second.

1030
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,760
Jealous is not the word I would use.

1031
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,560
I got heated.

1032
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,640
Let's bring that down a little bit, yeah?

1033
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm main tanking, bro.

1034
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,100
It is what it is.

1035
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,880
That's fine, bro.

1036
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,700
You can main tank.

1037
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,960
Listen, I'm going to support you in ways you've never been supported.

1038
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,260
I promise you.

1039
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,680
Wait, are you a support?

1040
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,520
It's actually over.

1041
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,700
It's actually so over.

1042
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,480
You need like a one-to-one guy.

1043
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,660
Listen, I'm not trying to latch on others, but you guys sit here and you play this game all day for a living.

1044
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,120
You come to my world, I'll beat your ass at 10 different games.

1045
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,540
Really?

1046
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,120
I mean, that's true.

1047
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:14,880
He plays chess.

1048
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,940
I just don't see that happening.

1049
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,820
Oh my god, I'm top tier in like 15 games, guys.

1050
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,700
I can only play this game for a week to be better.

1051
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,380
Tyler, what are you playing earlier in the league right now?

1052
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,760
Chess, Warcraft 3, Street Fighter, CSGO.

1053
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,180
Wait, I hit Master in Street Fighter though.

1054
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,960
I'm halfway there.

1055
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,980
Wait, but you lost every game.

1056
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,060
Okay, that is not true.

1057
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,040
Why are we lying?

1058
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,320
Why are we lying?

1059
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,420
How do I accept an invite?

1060
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,700
They didn't send invites yet, so...

1061
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,080
Yeah.

1062
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,800
I forgot the Tonka T is multi-talented.

1063
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:48,960
Yeah, hello.

1064
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,240
Oh, guys, how about IRL feats?

1065
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,540
Oh, trust me, you don't want to go there.

1066
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,800
You don't want to go there.

1067
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,880
I got a burrito.

1068
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,600
You guys ate nice, bro.

1069
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:02,940
We're from...

1070
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,960
I forgot to do like...

1071
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,280
Not sure.

1072
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,260
I have to go do admin mode for...

1073
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:06,600
Hot cheetos on it.

1074
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,420
Was it admin mode for Discord?

1075
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,260
Wait.

1076
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,500
I'll be right back.

1077
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,880
I gotta reboot my Discord real quick.

1078
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:14,920
Alright, have fun.

1079
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,600
Alright, I forgot.

1080
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,040
I have to do it on admin mode for it to like activate.

1081
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,560
God damn it.

1082
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,520
Okay.

1083
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:23,720
Discord.

1084
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,460
Run as admin for my push to mute.

1085
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,500
Yeah, yeah.

1086
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,240
Push to mute.

1087
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,200
Uh...

1088
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,100
Alright.

1089
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,580
I guess I can have my push to mute button bind in.

1090
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,320
Okay.

1091
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,920
I almost joined the wrong team.

1092
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:39,960
Alright.

1093
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,320
I have my...

1094
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,860
I mean, honestly, if we have to go triple tank and you just hit the solo DPS...

1095
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,600
Or triple DPS...

1096
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:46,900
Or...

1097
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,560
What am I saying, bro?

1098
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,680
Triple support and you solo DPS?

1099
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,060
Yeah.

1100
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:50,720
Could do that.

1101
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,440
Yeah.

1102
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,600
And just never die?

1103
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:53,520
True.

1104
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:54,720
I think that's the play.

1105
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,240
That's a good strat, yeah.

1106
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,300
Actually...

1107
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,300
I have like a 70% win rate on Mantis.

1108
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,080
So if we do...

1109
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,800
Yeah, and I can just...

1110
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,140
Ooh, wait.

1111
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,340
Res comp might be in the way.

1112
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,060
That's actually huge.

1113
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,700
No, for sure, res comp is like insane.

1114
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,600
Now we got this shit.

1115
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,740
I'm actually not worried at all if I'm being honest.

1116
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,000
It depends on who we're fighting first.

1117
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,880
We could like use them as an experiment.

1118
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,220
True.

1119
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,660
Okay, if we're going against Guru's team, he will TP.

1120
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,800
Like, kidnap.

1121
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,220
Like...

1122
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:21,760
Oh yeah, no.

1123
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,860
If you're walking, a TP will spawn in front of you and you will walk through it into their entire team.

1124
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,960
We have to like watch our footing.

1125
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,400
He's really freaky with it.

1126
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,300
For sure, we first banned Wolverine as well into that team.

1127
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,180
Yeah, I'm down.

1128
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,020
Okay.

1129
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,180
I'll ask you for a friend.

1130
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,100
What rank are you guys?

1131
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,080
One above all.

1132
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,880
Yeah, I mean, I'm Celestial right now, but I'm like top...

1133
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,640
I'm usually top 500, so it's not...

1134
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,700
Really quickly, guys.

1135
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,940
I got one above all too as well.

1136
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:59,700
Really quickly, if you could make sure that you're appearing online and you have all of our spectators added, Scooby Dooby Doo, Dr. Spectator, Kitty House Sniff, $7.

1137
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,000
Just triple check you have all of that sorted and we're going to set up the lobby.

1138
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,160
Yeah.

1139
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:05,800
I'm in the lobby right now.

1140
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,080
Good luck.

1141
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,680
Have fun.

1142
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,600
Thank you.

1143
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,180
Thank you.

1144
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:08,340
Thank you.

1145
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,960
We know who we're playing against.

1146
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,120
Oh, yeah.

1147
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,540
Sorry, Tyler, for beating Mikayla the other day.

1148
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,920
That was a rough game.

1149
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,420
Yeah, she was fucking concussed.

1150
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,800
You're terrible at chess action.

1151
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,260
I was paying for shit that somebody like you could beat her.

1152
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,480
No offense.

1153
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,180
Wait, someone like you?

1154
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,300
What do you mean by that?

1155
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,280
What do you mean by someone like you?

1156
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:27,360
No.

1157
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,180
No, that's crazy.

1158
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,580
Wait, Tyler, I got a question.

1159
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,100
How much rivals have you played?

1160
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,500
Like, if you had a given number?

1161
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,540
A rough estimate?

1162
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,760
I got sponsored twice.

1163
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,440
About five hours.

1164
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,520
About five hours.

1165
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,200
So you only play when you're paid.

1166
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,780
Yeah, I'm a father.

1167
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,560
I'm too fucking busy to be playing chess.

1168
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,780
Oh, brother.

1169
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,680
Grow up, guys.

1170
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,960
I told you to sit here and play.

1171
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,960
You literally play chess for free.

1172
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,740
Oh, God.

1173
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,700
Well, I mean...

1174
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:05,980
It's all right.

1175
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,640
I got this.

1176
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,940
Just follow my lead.

1177
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,640
Yup.

1178
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:10,880
How about actually?

1179
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,000
I listen very well.

1180
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,420
I lock in like crazy.

1181
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,160
No, I believe it.

1182
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,700
You guys gotta tell me what to do.

1183
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,280
And I'll actually do it.

1184
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,600
I will micromanage you like you wouldn't believe.

1185
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,780
Hmm.

1186
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,340
Oh, no.

1187
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,780
It'd be not so hard.

1188
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,720
Because then I get aggravated.

1189
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,060
I like this scene.

1190
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,920
I'm happy.

1191
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:33,500
Oh, seriously.

1192
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,320
And it's not my fault.

1193
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,560
I'm gonna go to therapy today, guys.

1194
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,200
Yeah!

1195
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,220
No, I get it.

1196
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:39,700
I get it.

1197
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,420
I'm in there.

1198
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,640
It's weak mental.

1199
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,100
It happens.

1200
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,660
Let's go!

1201
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,980
I don't have to go to therapy.

1202
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,140
I'm gonna be okay mentally.

1203
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,060
Got any invites?

1204
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,560
Vibes established.

1205
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,460
I'm in the lobby right now, but...

1206
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,240
I didn't get anything yet, but...

1207
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,280
Yeah, I'm in the lobby as well.

1208
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:02,560
I think I have you.

1209
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,660
Should I have you added super?

1210
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,440
I think I do.

1211
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:04,980
Oh!

1212
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,720
You can add Gale.

1213
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,300
Just add me.

1214
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:08,960
I can just get you in.

1215
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,500
Is it just Gale?

1216
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:10,920
Is that all this?

1217
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,020
Yeah, this is Gale.

1218
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,340
Yeah.

1219
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:13,780
Simple.

1220
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,260
Nice.

1221
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:16,900
Okay.

1222
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,240
Invite.

1223
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,400
Should be good.

1224
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,760
And then...

1225
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,440
Are we on the right side or left?

1226
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,540
I don't...

1227
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,040
I don't know where we're supposed to be.

1228
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,100
Whose team are we fighting?

1229
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,020
Okay, Coconut's team is...

1230
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,980
That is...

1231
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,700
It's Shroud's team.

1232
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,220
Yeah.

1233
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1234
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,440
Okay.

1235
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,080
Shroud and Space.

1236
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,560
I like...

1237
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:41,720
So, Space...

1238
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,760
Space is like...

1239
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,320
You have to ban his Mag.

1240
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,580
I'm not joking.

1241
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,080
Space is like just the Mag guy.

1242
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,120
We have to ban his Magneto.

1243
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,820
That's the problem.

1244
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,280
I mean, I could match his Mag, but...

1245
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,340
Mag first ban?

1246
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,580
Yeah, but...

1247
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,720
Like, based on other characters, I just think we just ban him.

1248
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,340
Yeah.

1249
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,480
Make it easier for the rest of us.

1250
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,060
Just ban Mag.

1251
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,080
Shroud plays like...

1252
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,020
He kinda plays like a lot of stuff.

1253
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,380
I don't know.

1254
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,340
He usually goes...

1255
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,980
We would go Hawkeye too, yeah.

1256
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,220
Yeah.

1257
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,360
If it's like a content creator tournament, he usually just goes Hawkeye.

1258
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,400
A little bit of Punisher.

1259
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,540
That's fine though.

1260
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,360
I can mirror.

1261
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,120
Um...

1262
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,840
But yeah.

1263
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,220
I think, really, that's it.

1264
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,620
I don't...

1265
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,240
I don't know any of those other players' characters who lose the support.

1266
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:23,800
I think she'll just...

1267
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,020
Wait, you have the draft list.

1268
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,700
Look it up.

1269
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,200
Just see what they play.

1270
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,440
Oh, for sure.

1271
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,220
That is true, actually.

1272
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,420
True, true.

1273
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,940
Wait, whose team is it?

1274
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,500
Shroud's team?

1275
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,360
Yeah, it's Shroud's team.

1276
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:35,960
Let me see.

1277
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,420
Yeah.

1278
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,720
Mm-mm-mm.

1279
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,660
Mm-mm-mm.

1280
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,900
Yeah, Space plays Strange Mag.

1281
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,500
Mm...

1282
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,160
Punisher.

1283
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,980
Luna, Cloak and Dagger.

1284
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,220
I'm not really worried about that.

1285
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,200
What does Shroud play?

1286
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:54,760
Shroud...

1287
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,320
Oh, like, he usually does, like, Hawkeye usually when he does, like, content creator tournaments.

1288
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,320
Cause it's easy for, like, get easy picks on the weaker players.

1289
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:02,740
Right.

1290
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,240
In general.

1291
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,620
I mean, do you wanna ban Hawkeye?

1292
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,300
I mean, we could.

1293
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,880
Uh, we could ban it next.

1294
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:09,760
I think...

1295
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,860
So, they're gonna...

1296
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,120
They're going to wanna ban Punisher.

1297
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,000
We protect it first, and that forces them out to ban Rocket.

1298
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,460
And I think they have a Rocket player.

1299
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,100
Yeah.

1300
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:18,520
So, it works out.

1301
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,100
So, it works out.

1302
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,220
So, they'll have to ban Rocket, and they can't play Rocket.

1303
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,760
Yay!

1304
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,180
Yeah.

1305
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,180
That's fine.

1306
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,260
That works out for us.

1307
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,200
It does.

1308
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,060
Wait, wait, I can only play Rocket.

1309
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,100
Okay, that doesn't work out for us.

1310
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:32,420
Okay.

1311
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,500
Is there anything else you have to share?

1312
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,220
Okay, there has to be something else you play though, right?

1313
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,140
Um, not, like, support.

1314
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:46,900
Okay, so, I learned Rocket, and then I learned Skrull Girl, and I learned the thing.

1315
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,040
But, like, I...

1316
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,800
I really...

1317
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,700
Rocket's really my, like, guy.

1318
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,300
Can you play Cloak?

1319
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:54,780
No.

1320
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:55,920
No.

1321
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,200
I feel like...

1322
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,180
I feel like...

1323
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,620
I feel like...

1324
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:58,800
I feel like...

1325
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,460
If we do...

1326
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,900
Because I feel like the Rocket ban is just insane.

1327
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,800
I think...

1328
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,740
Because for sure, we're gonna protect Punisher, and it's nice to, like, get that ban out, like, on Rocket.

1329
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,080
I think we can put you on, like, Cloak.

1330
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,840
I think Cloak is, like...

1331
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,880
Cloak is pretty easy.

1332
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:12,560
Yeah.

1333
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,100
I've never played Cloak before.

1334
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,080
So, when you ult...

1335
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,860
I'm so scared.

1336
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,320
Okay.

1337
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,480
So, when you ult, you go trade forward, because it doesn't stack anymore.

1338
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,780
So, just try and make, like, a zone for us.

1339
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,500
And then, when you're in your ult, you go into Cloak form.

1340
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,440
Because you'll just live forever, and you can just get DPS damage from that.

1341
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,180
Yeah.

1342
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,480
That's basically it.

1343
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:30,740
Okay.

1344
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,720
Oh, I'm so scared.

1345
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,060
And then, when we...

1346
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,600
When we get dived, you throw out your right click.

1347
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,460
So, you know that orb of healing that you get?

1348
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,440
So, if we're getting...

1349
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,880
If they're doing dive, which...

1350
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,720
I don't know if they will, because the only tank player is space, but...

1351
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:43,520
I'm gonna be honest, though.

1352
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,080
I don't really know if teams are gonna ban...

1353
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,940
I feel like almost every team has someone that just wants to play Rocket.

1354
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,800
So, I don't really know if Rocket ban's gonna be...

1355
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,980
Well, I guess we'll see.

1356
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,140
Well, it'll make them weaker, right?

1357
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,160
It'll make them weaker teams.

1358
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:54,960
Let's do this.

1359
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:55,980
Listen to this.

1360
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,340
Let's ban Mag.

1361
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,180
Protect Punisher, right?

1362
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,820
Then we ban Hawkeye.

1363
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,380
And then, we protect Hulk.

1364
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,400
It baits out the Namor, right?

1365
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:10,080
And then, we could just either ban like Torch or like Psylocke.

1366
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,220
We don't get two protects, do we?

1367
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,260
If we get two...

1368
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,160
It's the tournament mode.

1369
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,120
So, the newest one is...

1370
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,060
The newest one is get two protects and three bans.

1371
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,020
Alright.

1372
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,160
I mean, if they're doing it tournament mode...

1373
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,280
We bait those bans and then we play triple res.

1374
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,360
Yeah, guys.

1375
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,560
Protecting Punisher will always bait out a Rocket ban.

1376
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,240
Yeah.

1377
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:29,860
True.

1378
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,060
Unless they want to play Rocket, in which case...

1379
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,900
So, okay.

1380
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,340
So, if they don't ban Rocket, can I play Rocket?

1381
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,020
Yeah.

1382
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,360
Yeah, yeah.

1383
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:39,740
It's fine.

1384
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,060
Okay.

1385
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:40,960
Yeah.

1386
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,380
If we don't ban Rocket because...

1387
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,140
I'm so scared about playing Cloak.

1388
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:45,840
I'll try.

1389
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,920
If you think that's best, I'll do whatever you think is best.

1390
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,120
Cloak is like super easy to get into.

1391
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,940
I am just a bit worried.

1392
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,580
It's fine.

1393
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,100
It's okay.

1394
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,620
I'm gonna use restroom beer back real quick.

1395
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,040
We'll see how...

1396
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,820
I think you'll be fine, honestly.

1397
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,920
...first match goes along.

1398
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,220
Yeah.

1399
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,960
I think like almost every team has one Rocket player, so...

1400
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:03,720
Yeah.

1401
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,140
Yeah.

1402
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,520
Yeah.

1403
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,280
We'll be good.

1404
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,420
We'll be fine.

1405
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,820
We'll be fine.

1406
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,320
Look, I have confidence and that's all that matters.

1407
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,040
Yeah.

1408
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,440
But if I'm confident, we're good.

1409
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,480
We win this team.

1410
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,560
I believe in us.

1411
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,580
Alright, I'm back.

1412
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,020
I'm going Venom.

1413
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:19,800
We only have Tyler one.

1414
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,560
I'm going Venom only.

1415
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,120
Venom only?

1416
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:24,640
I mean, A.

1417
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,580
Oh wait, that's good.

1418
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,500
That is good.

1419
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:26,520
That is good.

1420
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,800
I only play Venom.

1421
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,740
Guys, it is what it is.

1422
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,000
No, that's fine.

1423
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,580
If I had to play rank right now, I would say I'm probably around...

1424
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,780
Little Master.

1425
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,680
There's no Master rank.

1426
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,320
Hi, Diamond.

1427
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,620
There is a Diamond.

1428
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,240
There is a Diamond, yeah.

1429
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,440
Hi, Diamond.

1430
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,020
No, I believe you.

1431
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:48,900
I believe you too.

1432
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,480
I mean, you're a god gamer.

1433
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,680
Okay, you're saying it too much that it makes it sound sarcastic.

1434
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,440
No, this is the first time I've said you're a god gamer.

1435
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:58,520
Great.

1436
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,920
Well, I mean...

1437
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,120
Super might be sarcastic, but I believe in you.

1438
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,480
No, I'm only here to uplift.

1439
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,140
I swear to god.

1440
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,900
I only want the best for our team.

1441
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,840
I believe it.

1442
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,240
We can win.

1443
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,100
I think we can get top three.

1444
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,200
I think you have to move over to the other team.

1445
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,900
Wait, who's on the other team?

1446
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,040
Oh, Lydia.

1447
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,300
Lydia has the...

1448
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:24,540
Yeah.

1449
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,580
Oh, wait.

1450
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
Move to...

1451
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,220
To Team A.

1452
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:28,960
To Team A.

1453
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,280
Team A.

1454
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,580
Yeah, you see the join button?

1455
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,100
Yeah.

1456
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,800
Oh, perfect.

1457
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,340
Thank you.

1458
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:54,250
Okay, also, if Tyler wants to play Venom, I could go Thing and just like...

1459
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:58,210
Thing Venom dive the back line and pray for the best.

1460
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,510
You know, we...

1461
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:02,510
You really want to destroy their back line, you go Captain America, too.

1462
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,710
Yeah, I could do Cap, too.

1463
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,030
Yeah.

1464
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,030
Listen, Cap Bucky is crazy.

1465
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,650
I feel like it's so underrated.

1466
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:08,150
Yeah.

1467
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,610
The health you get, the shield you get is...

1468
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,430
And I'll just put...

1469
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:12,330
I'll put the...

1470
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:12,470
Yeah.

1471
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:15,230
If I play Lune, I could just put the orb on Gale, and then he'll just...

1472
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:15,990
Yeah.

1473
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,250
...do whatever the fuck you want.

1474
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:18,350
True.

1475
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:22,550
Um...

1476
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:22,970
Okay.

1477
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:25,850
Actually...

1478
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:26,510
Mm...

1479
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:27,510
I think...

1480
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:28,470
I think we ban Hawkeye first.

1481
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,710
I don't...

1482
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:30,030
Yeah, I'm down.

1483
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,730
I don't believe they're gonna protect Mag first, actually.

1484
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,070
I think we just ban Hawkeye.

1485
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,610
And then go from there.

1486
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,770
I think Hawkeye is just too much of a wild card.

1487
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,050
They might use it, yeah.

1488
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:39,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1489
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:40,450
Yeah, and he...

1490
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:43,350
Yeah, and you could like easily pick out like our other players, too.

1491
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:44,770
Yeah.

1492
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,830
Yeah, if we don't have a shield, I think it's gonna be a...

1493
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,210
Yeah.

1494
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:48,470
I agree.

1495
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:50,910
I think...

1496
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:51,470
I think they're...

1497
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:52,850
They're...

1498
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:53,250
Cause like...

1499
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:57,450
I think you can easily get rid of the back line support, too, with Cap and Venom.

1500
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:58,730
Especially...

1501
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,590
I think like...

1502
00:55:59,590 --> 00:55:59,770
Yeah.

1503
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,870
I know Lulu...

1504
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,470
Lulu's gonna be playing their support.

1505
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,550
I don't know who else is gonna be playing support.

1506
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,850
But dive is always like cancer for any...

1507
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,290
And any elo, so...

1508
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:10,770
Yeah, true.

1509
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:11,830
Very true.

1510
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,790
And then it's fucking terrible.

1511
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,310
Mm-hmm.

1512
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:15,860
Mm-hmm.

1513
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:18,150
Alright.

1514
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,990
So ban Hawkeye, protect Punisher.

1515
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,910
Ban either Mag or Emma after that.

1516
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,890
Protect Hulk.

1517
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,930
And then we can ban probably like Psylocke last.

1518
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,210
Oh yeah, no, fuck Psylocke.

1519
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,510
Yeah, that's like a 1v6 character right now.

1520
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,010
For sure needs a ban.

1521
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,130
If someone pulls...

1522
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:42,470
I feel like Shroud might pull out Human Torch, too, cause he plays flying characters.

1523
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,990
Oh, that character is so foul.

1524
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:45,550
Yeah.

1525
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,470
Human Torch?

1526
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,550
I don't think anyone on the enemy team plays Torch.

1527
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,650
No, I don't think so either.

1528
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:53,170
I know Shroud plays Storm, so I don't know if it transfers over to Torch.

1529
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,090
Torch requires quite a bit of play time, I think.

1530
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,150
That's true.

1531
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,570
I don't think he's confident on that.

1532
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,110
Okay, that's good for us then.

1533
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:01,970
Yeah.

1534
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:02,750
Just fuck that character.

1535
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:03,730
Yeah.

1536
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,510
So what are we waiting on here?

1537
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,330
Hey guys, everyone here, good to start?

1538
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:10,690
Yeah.

1539
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:11,990
Where are we?

1540
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:13,270
Let's get it going, baby!

1541
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,110
We're fucking ready!

1542
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:17,470
Alright!

1543
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,330
Can you really play it flat?

1544
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:20,650
Yes.

1545
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,490
See how the team you drafted performs, bro.

1546
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,890
Torch is like...

1547
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,550
The only way to kill Torch is in Psylocke.

1548
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,530
It's a good Psylocke player.

1549
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:33,870
I'm ready.

1550
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,550
So I had to blow my nose.

1551
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,390
That's why, like, even a Punisher can't confidently kill...

1552
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:51,110
I guess Hela too, but the thing is, what I learned is that a good Hela has struggles fighting as Human Torch when they're really far away.

1553
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,690
I can play Jeff if that is better.

1554
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:57,530
No, no, Rocket's better than Jeff.

1555
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:58,730
For sure.

1556
00:57:59,390 --> 00:57:59,550
Yeah.

1557
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:00,690
Okay.

1558
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:01,510
Definitely way better.

1559
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:03,910
Sir, you say to pick Clerk.

1560
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,250
Oh, no, we're not gonna ban Rocket so you can play Rocket.

1561
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:08,890
Oh my gosh!

1562
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:09,870
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

1563
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:10,970
Okay, thanks, guys.

1564
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:13,210
Okay.

1565
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:15,690
Raising all your volumes.

1566
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,330
Please don't yell.

1567
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,310
I'll try my best.

1568
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,070
Ban Wolverine?

1569
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:20,390
Alright.

1570
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:21,270
Oh, yeah.

1571
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:21,990
That's interesting.

1572
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,730
I'll ban Hawkeye here.

1573
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,970
Oh, they're scared of your Wolverine.

1574
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,550
Yeah, probably.

1575
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:27,950
Wait, guys.

1576
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:28,510
Wait, who's the leader?

1577
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,190
Oh, Gale, you're the leader.

1578
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:29,630
Gale, you're the leader.

1579
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:30,590
Oh, okay.

1580
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:31,950
Yeah, Hawkeye ban first.

1581
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:36,670
Then who do you want to protect?

1582
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:37,050
Punisher?

1583
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:37,810
Okay.

1584
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,190
Uh, yes.

1585
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,470
Yeah, that's fine.

1586
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:48,170
Do you think, with the Wolf Band, they're gonna play Groot?

1587
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:49,390
Mmm.

1588
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,490
Groot?

1589
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,350
Space can play Groot.

1590
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,830
But it's usually for Iremix that plays Groot, though, when they play together.

1591
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:58,610
Okay.

1592
00:58:59,150 --> 00:58:59,470
Oh.

1593
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,150
They did protect Mag.

1594
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:02,030
Alright.

1595
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,270
It's fine.

1596
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,110
Um...

1597
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,010
I think...

1598
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:08,090
Ooh.

1599
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:08,790
Okay, ban Rocket.

1600
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,150
Yep, that's fine.

1601
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:10,750
I know.

1602
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,730
Okay, you can't play Rocket anymore.

1603
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:13,790
I think...

1604
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:13,970
I think...

1605
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:14,490
I think...

1606
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:15,450
I think we ban Groot.

1607
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,910
Yeah, I'm actually fine with that, I think.

1608
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:18,590
Yeah, yeah.

1609
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,760
And then who do you want to protect?

1610
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,540
Hulk?

1611
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,320
Hulk.

1612
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,020
Hulk, yeah.

1613
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,260
Yeah, that's fine.

1614
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1615
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,260
Because it baits out Namor ban.

1616
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,680
But what if they don't do it?

1617
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,300
Well, you're not smart enough.

1618
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,820
Let's see.

1619
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,040
I think we're thinking too high ELO.

1620
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,620
Might be.

1621
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,360
We're thinking as if we're in high ELO ranks right now.

1622
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,100
Emma.

1623
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,780
Emma Mag.

1624
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:54,900
So they're going Emma Mag.

1625
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,520
That's a pain in the ass.

1626
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,580
Oh, you did it!

1627
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,080
They did ban Namor.

1628
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:00,860
Yep.

1629
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,080
Easy bait, easy bait.

1630
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,200
No, that's fine.

1631
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:04,940
Um...

1632
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,520
Psylocke?

1633
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,260
I mean...

1634
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,220
Troud can play Psylocke.

1635
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,200
That's the thing.

1636
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:09,740
Yeah.

1637
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,240
I don't know if they have a side player.

1638
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,500
I think I'm just going to do Torch because Troud plays a little bit of it.

1639
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:15,420
Okay.

1640
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:15,940
That's fine.

1641
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:16,440
I don't think they play Psylocke.

1642
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,060
That's fine.

1643
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,660
I'd rather go against a Psylocke than a Torch.

1644
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,940
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

1645
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:20,700
Yeah.

1646
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,600
Pick your hero.

1647
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,040
All right.

1648
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,560
Well, if we're going...

1649
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,960
They have Emma Mag.

1650
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:25,940
We need triple res.

1651
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:26,400
Triple res is open.

1652
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:28,820
Yeah, we could.

1653
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,280
You can play whatever support deck you're most comfortable on.

1654
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,400
Because we're going to do triple res.

1655
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,760
But it has to be a main healer.

1656
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,940
So it has to have a lot of heals.

1657
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,280
So our job?

1658
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,420
I will bring Psylocke down this universe, no matter the cost.

1659
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,100
Oh.

1660
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,040
Um...

1661
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:41,860
Okay.

1662
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,620
You can aim pretty well, right?

1663
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,860
You could probably play Mantis.

1664
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,100
I'll go main healer.

1665
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,720
Okay, maybe I should just go Mag?

1666
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:53,440
I don't know.

1667
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,260
Because Mantis isn't that bad, right?

1668
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,000
Like, it's just right click on Psylocke.

1669
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,460
Yeah, yeah.

1670
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,420
Definitely Mag for Psylocke.

1671
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:58,800
Yeah.

1672
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,420
All right.

1673
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,220
I think...

1674
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,420
No, I think you should get...

1675
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,560
I think, uh...

1676
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,040
Bliss, you should go Mantis.

1677
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,540
Just because, like, you have more game sense on Mantis.

1678
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,740
And Mantis requires a lot of game sense, too.

1679
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,320
I think, Lydia, you could try Jeff or Cloak.

1680
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,440
Cloak would be better.

1681
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,700
But if you're not comfortable, then Jeff, we can make it work.

1682
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,280
Jeff is...

1683
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:18,700
No, Jeff is...

1684
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,560
If this is Odin's Archive, Jeff is good on this map.

1685
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,640
Yeah, you just have to make sure you use it as a main hero.

1686
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,240
I've never played Cloak.

1687
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:23,960
I'm so...

1688
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,380
Go, Jeff.

1689
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,080
I'll play really careful.

1690
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:27,620
Okay, guys.

1691
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,620
I'm so sorry.

1692
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,700
You're gonna be there to heal, basically.

1693
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,700
You're, like, the main hero.

1694
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:31,840
It's fine.

1695
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,100
You go, Jeff.

1696
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:32,440
You go, Jeff.

1697
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,260
Okay.

1698
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,000
Alright, let's go, team.

1699
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:35,560
Woo!

1700
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:36,600
Let's get it.

1701
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,360
What you need to do is capture the mission area.

1702
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,000
Got it?

1703
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,620
I'll call for bubble.

1704
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,040
Yeah, you can...

1705
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,580
It is my destiny to lead you to victory.

1706
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,380
Alright, here we go.

1707
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,240
Alright, I believe.

1708
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,040
Where do I go?

1709
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,520
Uh, just on down the way up top until they come point, and then you can dive them.

1710
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1711
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,700
So wait until they went there, hello.

1712
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,600
If you have a touch point, you can go.

1713
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,140
Let me know when you have bubblegill.

1714
01:01:59,340 --> 01:01:59,980
Emma, mag?

1715
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:00,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1716
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,440
Let them in a little bit.

1717
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,440
Yeah.

1718
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,400
I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

1719
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:05,740
I'm coming in!

1720
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:08,800
I'm gonna touch point.

1721
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,740
we'll just hold quick enemies.

1722
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:10,280
Space is low!

1723
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,600
I'm low, emma, emma, emma.

1724
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,260
We're fine, you're fine.

1725
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,520
Emma no form.

1726
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:19,160
We could probably be a burner.

1727
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,060
I'll bubble for you, Gale.

1728
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,600
Okay, I'm gonna...

1729
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,140
Yeah, help you.

1730
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,840
We must have star little Ter Zachy.

1731
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,620
Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma!

1732
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:27,820
I gotcha, I gotcha.

1733
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,500
I have no more snaps.

1734
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,180
I have no more snaps.

1735
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:30,980
I'm building up.

1736
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,260
I'm going, ready?

1737
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1738
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:35,400
I'll hold you.

1739
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:36,640
Where are you?

1740
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,320
I'll hold you.

1741
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:37,920
I knew you was res.

1742
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,620
Can we keep Emma on point?

1743
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,300
She's too far forward.

1744
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:42,820
I'm on Hela too.

1745
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,260
Emma, Emma with you.

1746
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:44,840
Emma low.

1747
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,260
Emma low.

1748
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,220
Emma low.

1749
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:46,660
Emma low, Emma low.

1750
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:47,780
She's low, she's one.

1751
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:48,980
I want invis women.

1752
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,660
Invis one.

1753
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,080
I don't have heals, I don't have heals.

1754
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,140
Come back, come back.

1755
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:53,800
Magus is dead.

1756
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,440
They wasted ult.

1757
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,960
I'm gonna get on high ground.

1758
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,040
Hello back.

1759
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,520
Focus on close, you're down.

1760
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,020
Invis one?

1761
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,000
She's low, she's one, she's one.

1762
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,880
Oh my god.

1763
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,660
We don't have minions.

1764
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,660
I can hold you again, Gail, whatever you want.

1765
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,260
Okay, okay, hold on.

1766
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,860
Do you want to go here or back?

1767
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,340
Up to you.

1768
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:20,880
Wait a bit, wait a bit.

1769
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:21,920
I'm gonna back, I'm gonna back.

1770
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,340
I have ult here.

1771
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,380
Back up, I'm point, I'm point.

1772
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,640
Yeah, I played one, I played one, I'm point.

1773
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:25,980
It's fine.

1774
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,640
We don't have main heals right now.

1775
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,720
They drop kill above you.

1776
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:29,560
Okay, ready?

1777
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:29,960
Go.

1778
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,500
Oh, I got, I got shrouded.

1779
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:33,120
It's fine, I'm going to ult.

1780
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,280
I have ult, but ooh, I'm getting.

1781
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,100
Flap.

1782
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:37,500
That's fine.

1783
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,060
You set?

1784
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:39,300
Okay.

1785
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,060
I didn't see the hellos.

1786
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:43,680
Oh good.

1787
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,740
They're gonna have invis woman ult.

1788
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,780
They're gonna have mag ult.

1789
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:50,000
They're probably gonna mag ult when you start ult.

1790
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,860
They should have hella ult too.

1791
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,640
I have ult, I have ult.

1792
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,900
I can maybe bubble you too, Tyler, if you want ult.

1793
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,400
Also, can you damage boost?

1794
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,220
Can you damage boost Tyler when he ult goes for ult?

1795
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,020
I'm ready we have to call it.

1796
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,100
I could use the res or we reset.

1797
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,500
Then I push this a little bit.

1798
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:06,320
I'm going for you.

1799
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:06,580
Go for you.

1800
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,340
Oh, I probably will be.

1801
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:10,800
I need it.

1802
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,120
I need it.

1803
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:11,320
Oh.

1804
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,280
I have to use me.

1805
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,260
I don't have ult.

1806
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:24,880
I don't have ult.

1807
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't have ult.

1808
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:26,320
I don't have ult.

1809
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:26,360
I don't have ult.

1810
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,020
I don't have ult.

1811
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:27,220
I don't have ult.

1812
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:27,380
I don't have ult.

1813
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:27,500
I don't have ult.

1814
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,620
I don't have ult ult.

1815
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,080
I can kill Hello after.

1816
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,000
I can bubble you.

1817
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,060
Can you strike him out?

1818
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:34,700
Yeah.

1819
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,460
I'm actually I have ult through.

1820
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:36,780
I think.

1821
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:37,380
Yeah.

1822
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,380
I'm ult too.

1823
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,240
Take space.

1824
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:40,580
Take space.

1825
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:43,740
Emma slow.

1826
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,040
Emma slow.

1827
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:44,640
Emma nice.

1828
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,560
Hard push now.

1829
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:46,960
I have a hard push now.

1830
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,960
I have so far.

1831
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:49,320
I have so far.

1832
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,440
Oh never mind.

1833
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,120
We use manhazaw.

1834
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,060
We can fight point.

1835
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:52,920
We can fight point.

1836
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,240
Kill Hello maybe?

1837
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:55,440
Hello.

1838
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:57,400
Hell of a gun.

1839
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,240
Go for you.

1840
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,300
Oh, that...

1841
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,440
He's dead there.

1842
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:03,880
I want Invis woman?

1843
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,840
Invis, focus on Invis.

1844
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,860
I want them both, they're both one.

1845
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,120
Focus on Invis one.

1846
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,300
Focus on Invis one.

1847
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:13,960
Cloak a dagger.

1848
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,420
Cloak one, cloak one.

1849
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,220
Oh, she died here.

1850
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,760
Backing out a little bit.

1851
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,560
I'm gonna...

1852
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:24,840
My arm!

1853
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,500
Yeah, you can...

1854
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,560
I love you, I love you.

1855
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,740
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

1856
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,120
I want Punisher, Punisher, Punisher.

1857
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,680
Nice dive, I want Cloak and dagger, Cloak and dagger one.

1858
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,160
It's fine, I'll ris, I'll ris.

1859
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,200
Big ris, big ris.

1860
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,120
I'm sorry.

1861
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,960
I'm not, I'm not back there.

1862
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:43,840
Nice.

1863
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:45,240
I'm resing here?

1864
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,380
You guys should get the res, guys should get the res.

1865
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,140
Yeah.

1866
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,940
Can we just lose this, this is the default?

1867
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,600
It is really a hot little thing.

1868
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,120
Space is alone.

1869
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,560
Spit me out.

1870
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,440
Oh boy.

1871
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:01,840
Sorry.

1872
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:03,920
You're good, you're good.

1873
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1874
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:09,820
You're fine, you're fine.

1875
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,040
They're gonna have...

1876
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:11,400
Play, play, play.

1877
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,440
At least they strange TP'd.

1878
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,400
Careful, careful.

1879
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,160
They wasted.

1880
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,320
Yeah, it's fine.

1881
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,180
I had a drop, I had a bubble for you, Gil.

1882
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,280
Okay, okay, okay.

1883
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,100
I'm gonna go.

1884
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:20,260
Ready?

1885
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,940
Yeah.

1886
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,040
Oh, just be careful, we're down one, we're down one.

1887
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,380
Yeah, we don't have many heroes right now.

1888
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:26,920
Wait, kill, hello?

1889
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,240
Hello, hello, hello.

1890
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,460
We're fine, nice, nice.

1891
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,480
Tyler, can you just live?

1892
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,040
I'm living!

1893
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,740
I'm shielding shielding.

1894
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,100
I have the wall here, take face.

1895
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:40,820
Transo, Transo, Maglo.

1896
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,940
They broke my thing.

1897
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,520
Transo, Transo, Transo.

1898
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,100
Okay, I'm still bonding, I'm still bonding us.

1899
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,140
I blocked with it?

1900
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,100
Come out with it?

1901
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,020
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1902
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,360
Oh, there's so long we couldn't live through it.

1903
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,160
I don't think we can make it, I don't think we can make it.

1904
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:02,700
It's fine, it's fine.

1905
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,780
We definitely need... I think we might need to swap off Jeff here.

1906
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,080
Yeah, maybe plug and dagger.

1907
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:09,720
Yeah, yeah.

1908
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,500
Oh my God!

1909
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,820
No, I was in the ground.

1910
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:15,860
I was in the ground.

1911
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,700
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1912
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,260
I'm gonna be so real here.

1913
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,840
You actually have to play the dive.

1914
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,240
Just keep diving like that, play patient like that, and dive when they walk in, it's free.

1915
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,080
I can give you a quick crash course on cloak and dagger.

1916
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,100
Okay.

1917
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,420
Yeah, should I go clerk?

1918
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,700
Yeah, go cloak, go cloak.

1919
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,800
Okay, so...

1920
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,680
Your right click is really...

1921
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,940
It does a lot of heals, so use that for mostly tanks, or if you're getting dived.

1922
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:42,360
Okay.

1923
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:46,920
Yeah, and then when you're ulting, go into cloak form, and then left click people.

1924
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:54,600
And then when the mag ults, you keep your cloaking ability, where you fly up in the air as a cloak, and shield all of us.

1925
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,620
You keep that for a mag ult.

1926
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,600
So if mag ults us, use that to shield us, and we won't get mag ulted.

1927
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:02,620
Yeah.

1928
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,520
Okay, an E is like a heal?

1929
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1930
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,380
E is heal, use that for tanks.

1931
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,840
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1932
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,280
Correct, correct.

1933
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,840
So what does Q like do exactly?

1934
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,700
You dash in four straight lines, and when we stand in it, we get a lot of healing.

1935
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,280
Yeah, but they don't stack.

1936
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,020
So just make sure you dash like in new spaces.

1937
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,480
So I'm supposed to right click you guys.

1938
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:23,220
Yeah.

1939
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:23,700
Yes.

1940
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:24,260
Okay, okay.

1941
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,660
You just heal us, yeah, yeah.

1942
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,160
I can move you go.

1943
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,060
Honestly, you just play.

1944
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,660
We just do that every time, Tyler.

1945
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,300
I'm low, I'm low.

1946
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,620
I got you, I got you.

1947
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,220
Punisher, Punisher, Punisher.

1948
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:37,980
Punisher, yeah, yeah.

1949
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:38,700
Punisher dead.

1950
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,480
Mag one dead.

1951
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,600
There's Emma on the bottom.

1952
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,860
I'm capping points here.

1953
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,160
I'm capping.

1954
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,080
I'm dead.

1955
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:47,980
Wait, actually fat died.

1956
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,260
I think whenever I call bubble for Gale, Tyler one, you just go with them, and we kill them every time.

1957
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:53,840
It's actually free.

1958
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1959
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:55,780
Easy.

1960
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,140
Um, they're coming high ground, looks like.

1961
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:03,660
Yeah, yeah, high ground.

1962
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,420
Yeah, you're here.

1963
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,880
Wait, so a left click, is that a heal?

1964
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:07,880
It's just heal, yeah.

1965
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,500
Just stay in dagger form.

1966
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,260
Just stay in dagger form.

1967
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,020
You don't have to stay.

1968
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,600
Oh, cut the two back, just back.

1969
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:12,920
Everyone back.

1970
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,660
Everyone back.

1971
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,440
I can go with my left.

1972
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:16,540
I can go with my left.

1973
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,380
I believe you, Tyler.

1974
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,180
I don't have bubble, no bubble.

1975
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:18,540
Gale.

1976
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,820
Can you really go?

1977
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,460
I'm gonna go only.

1978
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,180
Yeah, we can go.

1979
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,480
Nice.

1980
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:23,380
Don't worry.

1981
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,240
I might be dead here.

1982
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,460
I got you.

1983
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,160
I'm a lower point.

1984
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,340
I don't think I can get.

1985
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,160
I don't think I can get.

1986
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,280
I want Punisher.

1987
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,500
Punisher feeding.

1988
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:34,240
Punisher feeding.

1989
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:34,820
Heard.

1990
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,080
Heard.

1991
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,520
I got two.

1992
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:40,940
Nice.

1993
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:41,360
Nice.

1994
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:41,500
Nice.

1995
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,400
Nice.

1996
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:42,720
Nice.

1997
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:43,200
Nice.

1998
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:45,720
Nice.

1999
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:46,840
Nice.

2000
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:54,660
Nice.

2001
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:54,740
Nice.

2002
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:55,180
Good job.

2003
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,800
We don't... both... Matt and I don't have res, so...

2004
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,900
I'm not there right now.

2005
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,270
I'm walking back.

2006
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,130
I'm gonna go pretty quickly.

2007
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,590
I can bubble you when I'm back, Gale.

2008
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,190
They're gonna have mag ult.

2009
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:15,530
I almost have ult myself.

2010
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:17,530
I don't have... I have a ship for it.

2011
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:19,870
I'm here, Gale, whenever they walk in.

2012
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:20,390
Okay, okay.

2013
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,030
You ready, Tyler?

2014
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:21,250
Go.

2015
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:22,850
I'm gonna go.

2016
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:23,430
I bubble geek, Gale.

2017
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:24,690
Oh, I'm gonna walk that.

2018
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:25,210
They're gonna kill me.

2019
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:25,750
I'm probably dead.

2020
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,890
Oh, you are.

2021
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,470
Two ults, two ults out, two ults out.

2022
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,870
I got you.

2023
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:33,830
Oh, I couldn't help you.

2024
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:34,710
Just solemn point.

2025
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:35,830
Just solemn point.

2026
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:36,670
Don't use any ults.

2027
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:37,430
Can you live, Gale?

2028
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,670
Yeah, I think... probably not, actually.

2029
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:41,450
I'm ready.

2030
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:44,590
There's still so much to do.

2031
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:47,030
Are you gonna live, Tyler, or are you dead?

2032
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,170
Of course I'm gonna live.

2033
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,730
I'm that guy.

2034
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,070
He is critical health.

2035
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,250
He is critical health right now.

2036
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,630
We should push, we should push, we should push.

2037
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:54,070
The nexus.

2038
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:54,870
The nexus.

2039
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:55,710
Yeah, just push her.

2040
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2041
01:10:58,490 --> 01:10:59,110
I'm with you, Sips.

2042
01:10:59,290 --> 01:10:59,630
I'm with you.

2043
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,430
Oh, the Emma's just walking at me every time.

2044
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:02,150
No, it's fine.

2045
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:02,350
It's fine.

2046
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:02,690
I got you.

2047
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:03,170
We got you.

2048
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,510
Oh, please.

2049
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:07,270
Oh, my God.

2050
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,350
Oh, my God.

2051
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:08,750
Okay, the Emma's gonna close me more.

2052
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:09,930
I gotta play that one as well.

2053
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,370
Okay, just back to the back.

2054
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:13,510
I couldn't save you.

2055
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:16,990
We have, we have cloak ult, though.

2056
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:20,350
Punisher dead, Punisher dead.

2057
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:21,010
Nice.

2058
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,610
Oh, no, he's gone.

2059
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:23,390
Oh, I went to E.

2060
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:24,470
I fucking punched E.

2061
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:25,150
It's okay.

2062
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:26,930
We can engage with cloak ult here.

2063
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:27,870
The Punisher's dead right now.

2064
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:28,350
They're down one.

2065
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:29,430
Yeah, we should.

2066
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,190
I just make sure we full pocket, because...

2067
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,570
Wait, space is really pushed up.

2068
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:35,690
Which one is the real space, though?

2069
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:36,170
I believe...

2070
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:37,370
Oh, shit.

2071
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,170
Okay, so...

2072
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,050
You want me to...

2073
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:40,790
Okay, just let me...

2074
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:41,270
Just go for it.

2075
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:42,010
Just go for it.

2076
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:42,870
Just go for it.

2077
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,130
Hey!

2078
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:46,010
No, no, Emma's gonna walk me.

2079
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:46,930
Get ready to heal me.

2080
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,550
Yeah, I don't want snaps now.

2081
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:48,890
Go for you.

2082
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:49,270
Go for you.

2083
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:50,750
I love you.

2084
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:52,350
We need to walk.

2085
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:52,730
We need to walk.

2086
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:53,390
Yo, hell of a bird.

2087
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:53,890
Hell of a bird.

2088
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:55,790
No, I'm dead instantly, bro.

2089
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:56,450
Hell of a one.

2090
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,170
I'm walking.

2091
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,250
Wait, punish or isolated?

2092
01:11:59,410 --> 01:11:59,590
Top, top.

2093
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,570
Wait, punish or punish or...

2094
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:03,350
I don't have...

2095
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:04,390
I'm dead to this.

2096
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:06,010
I can res though.

2097
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:06,910
I res, I res.

2098
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:07,190
Okay, okay.

2099
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,670
I have all...

2100
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:08,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2101
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:08,970
It's one more.

2102
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:09,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2103
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,070
For sure, for sure.

2104
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:12,250
Melt, melt, melt, melt, melt, melt, melt, melt, melt.

2105
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:13,670
I'm...

2106
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:14,050
I'm shooting.

2107
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:14,450
I'm shooting.

2108
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,210
I'm shooting right now.

2109
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:16,210
I'm gonna use res.

2110
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:18,050
Hello, hello, hello.

2111
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:19,690
I love you, I love you, girl.

2112
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:20,190
I love you, girl.

2113
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,010
No bird.

2114
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:21,350
We have res.

2115
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:22,290
We have...

2116
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,150
I don't have any more snaps.

2117
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:27,710
Back in back in.

2118
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,770
I'm trying to save her cloak right now.

2119
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:31,050
I saw res.

2120
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,950
Oh, they just started walking at me.

2121
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:33,830
Yeah.

2122
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,290
Is anyone strange?

2123
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,090
I'm on strange, but you're gonna stall for a while.

2124
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,770
Aww, that's unlucky.

2125
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:52,890
They just started walking at me, and I started getting owned.

2126
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:57,490
Like, Emma just walked at me with Mag, and they just beat me up after the attacks.

2127
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,130
Okay, I think... I think I know what to do for this.

2128
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,350
We have to protect Rocket if they're gonna target Ben.

2129
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,990
We have to go and carry Ben here.

2130
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,170
Okay, okay.

2131
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,350
Yeah, I think I know what to do.

2132
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:11,270
It's fine.

2133
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:11,990
It's a scene match.

2134
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:14,290
All good.

2135
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:19,390
If anything, honestly, if anything, doesn't that mean we go against a team that also lost?

2136
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:21,830
Well, we play every team once, yeah.

2137
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:26,370
So we play every team once, and then it sets up the brackets.

2138
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:27,810
I see.

2139
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:28,670
Okay.

2140
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:31,970
Okay.

2141
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:33,050
No worries.

2142
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:33,990
No worries.

2143
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,410
Well, now we know, like, what to do for team comp wise.

2144
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:42,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2145
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:43,690
Yeah.

2146
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,070
Just protect Rocket.

2147
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:46,690
Yeah.

2148
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:47,590
Yeah, yeah.

2149
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,230
Oh, I got another invite.

2150
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:50,870
Whoa!

2151
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,510
Or a plan to XQC's team.

2152
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:55,090
Okay.

2153
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,670
We got this, guys.

2154
01:13:59,290 --> 01:13:59,650
Yeah.

2155
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:00,590
Well, yeah, we do.

2156
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:02,070
It's just a service warm-up, guys.

2157
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,010
You had really good dives, Tyler.

2158
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:04,450
Yeah.

2159
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:05,110
Thank you.

2160
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:06,850
You're also good, too.

2161
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:08,850
I am a bit dizzy.

2162
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,270
From the villain?

2163
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:13,490
You guys are screaming 15 things.

2164
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,370
I don't know who I'm supposed to be hitting.

2165
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:16,670
I have no idea.

2166
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:22,430
Okay, basically, if we're on that same comp, and I say I'm bubbling Gale, you just dive in with him every time.

2167
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:22,830
Correct.

2168
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,310
Just get ready to dive with him.

2169
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,410
I was Irma diving in.

2170
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:27,430
No, yeah, no, it was good.

2171
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:27,770
It was good.

2172
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,150
Yeah, that was good.

2173
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,150
Yeah, that's why you had, like, real critiques.

2174
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,230
Yeah, that kind of happens sometimes.

2175
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:34,470
Yeah.

2176
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,720
Is XQC most likely just gonna go Groot?

2177
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,100
Shouldn't we just let him play Groot?

2178
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,760
I'll play... Strange Groot.

2179
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,020
And then I'll play Mag.

2180
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:54,580
Okay.

2181
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,360
Let's see.

2182
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,360
Are they facing Mag's team we just played?

2183
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:17,880
It's unfortunate.

2184
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,900
I think it's just...

2185
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,460
Tinkum unfortunate.

2186
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:25,640
Because, like, one of our players is playing her very uncomfortable character.

2187
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,480
So, obviously...

2188
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,000
Also, like, I have to figure out...

2189
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,080
I haven't played Adam in a while, so I was like...

2190
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,300
How do I position as Adam again?

2191
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,260
Like...

2192
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,900
But then the thing is...

2193
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,540
Because, like, everybody is, like, all over the place skill level-wise...

2194
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:39,900
It's also, like...

2195
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,300
Because everybody is all over the place skill level-wise...

2196
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:46,120
People play in positions where I'm not used to...

2197
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,340
So, I have to readjust too.

2198
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:53,460
Yeah.

2199
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,020
But, yeah.

2200
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:57,740
Um...

2201
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,480
I need a...

2202
01:15:59,480 --> 01:15:59,900
No, yeah.

2203
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,720
I can't pocket anybody as Adam.

2204
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,300
I had to play Adam because, like...

2205
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,620
Nobody else on our team can play Adam.

2206
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:08,720
So...

2207
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,940
It was honestly, like...

2208
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,920
Because nobody else on my team can play Adam, I have to play Adam.

2209
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:12,620
More pause.

2210
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,600
Thank you for the super chat.

2211
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:13,860
Thank you.

2212
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,260
Thank you.

2213
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:14,700
Hi, Doki.

2214
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,980
Today is my birthday.

2215
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,180
I want to hear your celebration song from me.

2216
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:18,720
So could you...

2217
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,580
Of course I can.

2218
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,440
Happy birthday to you.

2219
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,160
Happy birthday to you.

2220
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,180
Happy birthday, dear more pause.

2221
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,700
Happy birthday to you.

2222
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,260
Yeah!

2223
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,020
Happy birthday!

2224
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,760
Yeah, it should be fine if she's...

2225
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,500
When she's on Rocket.

2226
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:33,080
The fact that they're target batting her...

2227
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,620
Is a bit unfortunate.

2228
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:35,520
Um...

2229
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,940
Just because, like...

2230
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:37,320
Uh...

2231
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,940
That's her most comfortable pick.

2232
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,900
And she was on main heels.

2233
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:43,060
So that was, like...

2234
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,620
Really not great for us.

2235
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,600
Just because she's on main heels.

2236
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,080
And when she dies, we don't have main heels.

2237
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,240
Also, I just realized...

2238
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,600
If we play triple res again, I think...

2239
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:03,540
What...

2240
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,800
Either me or Bliss should play main heels.

2241
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,240
Just because...

2242
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:07,660
So we can...

2243
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,060
So we can keep everybody up.

2244
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:09,780
Yeah.

2245
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2246
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,000
Otherwise...

2247
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,060
Yeah, because I think, like...

2248
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,340
Because you're just healing all the time.

2249
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:14,820
Yeah.

2250
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:16,900
Yeah, that's fine.

2251
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,040
I think the issue was that...

2252
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,320
They were obviously targeting Lydia too.

2253
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:22,860
Uh, yeah.

2254
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,300
Yeah.

2255
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:23,960
Honestly, guys.

2256
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:24,680
A warm-up game.

2257
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,300
Who says no?

2258
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2259
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,040
True.

2260
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:27,360
True, true.

2261
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:28,540
Yeah.

2262
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,040
I'm sorry, sorry.

2263
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,120
I'm sorry, guys.

2264
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,100
So, I don't know why.

2265
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:34,940
I...

2266
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,580
I, like...

2267
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,780
All day I was practicing yesterday.

2268
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,920
And I was practicing...

2269
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,960
One of each roll, right?

2270
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,420
So I practiced one DPS, one support, and one tank.

2271
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,160
That was, like, the stupidest thing ever.

2272
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:46,940
Because I didn't think...

2273
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,200
I should have just practiced multiple supports.

2274
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,180
I'm so sorry.

2275
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,020
No, it's like...

2276
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,260
I was, like, doing good on Rocket all morning.

2277
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,580
And I came in and I was like, okay, like, I'm so...

2278
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,420
I'm gonna do good.

2279
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,020
And then I just first-timed it.

2280
01:17:59,080 --> 01:17:59,820
I'm so sorry.

2281
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:00,500
I'm so sorry.

2282
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,080
No, it's okay.

2283
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:01,700
It's okay.

2284
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:02,840
It's like...

2285
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,020
It's just Marvel Rivals.

2286
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:04,980
They, like...

2287
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,440
People will target ban the...

2288
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,480
Obviously, like...

2289
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:11,140
If we have someone that is most comfortable on something, they'll target ban that.

2290
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,040
I mean, that's why we target ban it.

2291
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:13,800
Shroud's Hawkeye.

2292
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:15,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2293
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:16,400
All good.

2294
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,080
Why are we not doing damage that, like, in game?

2295
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,060
I felt like we weren't doing damage.

2296
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:20,740
Yeah, Gale.

2297
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,580
Why aren't we doing damage?

2298
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,760
Our only damage player.

2299
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:30,880
All good?

2300
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,300
Maybe our, um...

2301
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,980
Sweats need to play, like, fucking sweats then.

2302
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:36,920
Alright, alright.

2303
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,020
I'm gonna sweat even harder.

2304
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:38,520
I got it.

2305
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,360
Yeah, sweat a little bit.

2306
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,160
We didn't even say what we're banning.

2307
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,500
Like, we never decided.

2308
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:43,320
I know.

2309
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:43,960
Is this the...

2310
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,880
The actual bracket now, or no?

2311
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:46,820
No, it's round robin.

2312
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,720
This is the round robin.

2313
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:47,960
Yeah.

2314
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:49,740
So we can fuck around here.

2315
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,840
But then it'll make it harder for us later.

2316
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,520
I'll protect Rocket first, this time.

2317
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:58,300
Yeah.

2318
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:58,860
For us.

2319
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,780
Oh, they ban...

2320
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:01,060
Ooh.

2321
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,380
Wait, that's actually good.

2322
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:04,760
Hmm?

2323
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,180
They ban Hell, yeah.

2324
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:06,820
I thought maybe...

2325
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,520
I was worried they were gonna ban Rocket, but they didn't.

2326
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,440
I don't think they know.

2327
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,220
Oh, they have a Jeff player.

2328
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:13,880
Ban Jeff?

2329
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,860
That means they have a Jeff one trick.

2330
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:17,060
Okay.

2331
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,680
On this map, though?

2332
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,000
I mean, I guess it's fine.

2333
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:28,720
Uh...

2334
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,220
Wait, let me look at the...

2335
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:30,720
Oh, shit.

2336
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:31,900
I think...

2337
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,420
We could...

2338
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,720
I think he banned Hawkeye here.

2339
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,960
Because Siegel plays Hawkeye.

2340
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,020
Oh, that's true.

2341
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:37,820
Siegel does play Hawkeye.

2342
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,720
I low-key don't want to play against Cap.

2343
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:41,940
I think Cap is the ban.

2344
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,200
Oh, true.

2345
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:43,760
They were playing it.

2346
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:44,360
Hopefully...

2347
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,600
If they don't protect Hawkeye, I think we ban Hawkeye, though.

2348
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:47,360
I agree.

2349
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:51,280
I think if they protect Jeff, we ban the Jeff team up with banning Luna, no?

2350
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:52,640
Luna?

2351
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,360
Depends on which player is on Jeff.

2352
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,580
If it's one of your weaker players, she's not going to do anything.

2353
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,180
Wait.

2354
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:57,840
It might be...

2355
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,860
It might be E-Rob on Jeff, no?

2356
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,920
Okay, we don't need to ban Luna if E-Rob's going to be us.

2357
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,640
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't know if we need to...

2358
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:05,380
Okay.

2359
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,900
If it's E-Rob, I don't...

2360
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,440
I don't think we need to do it.

2361
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,200
Because I'm looking at the...

2362
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,660
Okay, so they protect Hawkeye.

2363
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,580
Is it Moxie, Siegel, Shrine and Apple Thieves?

2364
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,260
It might be.

2365
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,180
Oh, they protected Hawkeye.

2366
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,020
Yeah.

2367
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,440
Okay, so...

2368
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,160
We definitely need a shield then.

2369
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,140
Yeah.

2370
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:27,800
Um...

2371
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,080
Oh, wait.

2372
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,920
Apparently it's not.

2373
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:29,840
Okay.

2374
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:30,880
Well...

2375
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,060
Who left the last?

2376
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:32,560
Who do we think?

2377
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,880
If it's not E-Rob on Jeff, we could ban Luna.

2378
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,940
But also we could ban Human Torch.

2379
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:38,920
I think Emma.

2380
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:39,460
I think Emma.

2381
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,240
Honestly.

2382
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:40,920
Emma?

2383
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:45,480
I think Emma was a really big problem last game too.

2384
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,640
We just don't let them play that character.

2385
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,600
Also, I think we triple res again.

2386
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,680
Especially since Hela's banned.

2387
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:00,760
Yeah.

2388
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,040
We do triple res.

2389
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:02,920
Okay.

2390
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,620
But it's fine.

2391
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,240
It's fine to say because Rockets gonna be played now.

2392
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:07,960
Okay.

2393
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:08,760
And it all works out.

2394
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,300
We have to.

2395
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,340
I think we have to really get on this Hawkeye though.

2396
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,420
Like, don't let him breathe.

2397
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:12,760
For sure.

2398
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,200
For sure.

2399
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:17,020
Yeah, so Ty, you just dive on Hawkeye if you can.

2400
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:17,860
Yeah.

2401
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:18,380
Okay.

2402
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,040
We'll do.

2403
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,140
If we lose first round, we'll just...

2404
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:21,640
I'll just go play.

2405
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,580
Who's Hawkeye on their team?

2406
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:24,640
You know like...

2407
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,280
I mean Moxie?

2408
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,260
You know the Archer guy?

2409
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,080
Seagull and Moxie.

2410
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:28,740
Yeah, Seagull.

2411
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,720
Yeah, Seagull.

2412
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:31,480
Okay, so.

2413
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,880
Either Seagull or Moxie, I'm just on the entire game.

2414
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:34,560
Yes.

2415
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:35,780
Yeah.

2416
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,680
That I can do.

2417
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:39,620
Now that's a fucking call.

2418
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,180
Let's go, baby.

2419
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,200
Nope.

2420
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,500
I am no gold.

2421
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,780
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

2422
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,980
I am simply a man who wishes to use his power for good.

2423
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:49,760
I mean...

2424
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,300
30 seconds before you attack.

2425
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,100
Put your E right here.

2426
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:53,620
Oh yeah, yeah.

2427
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,380
Put your E out right now, Lydia.

2428
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:56,280
Hey.

2429
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,040
One of my...

2430
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,000
Yeah, so we can get armor.

2431
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:01,120
And then when we get out of our spawn, just destroy your E.

2432
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:01,940
Just press E.

2433
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:02,480
Again.

2434
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:04,960
Look at your swings.

2435
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,060
My swings are good, bro.

2436
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,200
I had a couple bad swings.

2437
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,040
Oh, sorry.

2438
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:09,520
I didn't mute.

2439
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:12,700
Alright, let's go team.

2440
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,020
We got this.

2441
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:15,020
Yippee!

2442
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,020
Last game was warm up.

2443
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:16,640
Yeah.

2444
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,640
Every game is warm up until we win.

2445
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:19,760
True.

2446
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,180
Alright, now push E again.

2447
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,540
Good job.

2448
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,640
Let's go in the right side here.

2449
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:24,780
Yeah.

2450
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,180
I don't want to go here, but...

2451
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,440
Yeah.

2452
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,020
Think of this comp, that's better.

2453
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:31,740
I'll call for you, okay?

2454
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,260
Yeah, I'll bubble you whenever.

2455
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,260
Okay.

2456
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:34,980
can't walk up through.

2457
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,320
Oh, they're close!

2458
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:36,700
Really close!

2459
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:37,840
Okay, ready?

2460
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:38,380
Here you go!

2461
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,360
Yeah, lovely.

2462
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,300
Yeah, good!

2463
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:41,640
Take careful.

2464
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:43,540
Mag half.

2465
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,300
Luna halft.

2466
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:47,360
Wow, I on Hawkeye!

2467
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:48,520
Hawkeye slow!

2468
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,200
Hawkeye slow!

2469
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:49,600
Hawkeye slow!

2470
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:49,940
Nice!

2471
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,680
I'm going to point right now.

2472
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,740
I'm going to point right now.

2473
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,200
Oh, I was- I'm on.

2474
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,680
Just get point, get point.

2475
01:22:59,040 --> 01:22:59,260
I'm on.

2476
01:22:59,260 --> 01:22:59,560
I'm on.

2477
01:22:59,560 --> 01:22:59,860
I'm on.

2478
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,660
I have no snaps.

2479
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,960
I am really low at all right now.

2480
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,080
I can bubble you too, Gale!

2481
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:07,620
I can bubble you too, Gale.

2482
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,720
Come to us.

2483
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,260
I'm out, I'm Hawkeye, Hawkeye.

2484
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,900
I'm in Rocket.

2485
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,400
I need a carry.

2486
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,600
They don't have snaps right now.

2487
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:17,840
I have already, I have already.

2488
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,140
They are running...

2489
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,780
I can bubble you and you will, just call me!

2490
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,980
Just say when they come out.

2491
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:29,440
Yeah, yeah, you can go.

2492
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:29,840
I've dumped them in.

2493
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:30,880
I got you.

2494
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,640
Hard push, hard push.

2495
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,300
Little one, little one, little one.

2496
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,440
Oh, I'm getting bullied here.

2497
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:37,520
It's fine, I got you.

2498
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:38,700
Dead?

2499
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,820
Oh, it's almost fine.

2500
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:43,760
No, you're fine, you're fine.

2501
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:44,400
It's okay, it's okay.

2502
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,120
I'm going back.

2503
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:45,820
I got him, I got him.

2504
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:46,880
I'm back.

2505
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:48,900
We don't have a rest of it.

2506
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:49,540
Can we kill?

2507
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:49,780
Okay?

2508
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:50,340
No, I'm gonna back.

2509
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,340
No, no, no, back up, back up.

2510
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:52,600
Watch Jephel.

2511
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:53,840
I can maybe ult to Jephel.

2512
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,900
I have to save for the Jephel.

2513
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,740
But he's gonna get bubbled, so...

2514
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,760
I can bubble you, Tyler?

2515
01:23:58,760 --> 01:23:59,920
you're back.

2516
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,740
Oh, Marky's low.

2517
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,680
Just set up for dive, Tyler.

2518
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,680
You can sit up on top of this wall over here.

2519
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:07,480
No snaps, no snaps.

2520
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:08,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2521
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,120
I'm getting, oh, my...

2522
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:10,880
I have to.

2523
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,620
I'm okay, nice to learn how to do that.

2524
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,700
I am ready to put on this...

2525
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,700
Back-point, everyone.

2526
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,400
Come point, everyone.

2527
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:18,900
Come point, everyone.

2528
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:19,740
I'm gonna have Rez.

2529
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:20,660
Oh, yeah, Rez.

2530
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:21,100
Oh, okay.

2531
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:21,940
That's my bad.

2532
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,140
Come up the Hawkeye?

2533
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:24,500
Yeah, I'm gonna Hawkeye, I'm gonna Hawkeye.

2534
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,780
Oh, he used...

2535
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:29,120
Okay, he tried to solo field kit.

2536
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:29,860
One hot guy?

2537
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,260
It doesn't matter.

2538
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,040
He's one HP.

2539
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,100
Hawkeye one.

2540
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:33,900
Hawkeye one.

2541
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:35,060
I probably yield.

2542
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:35,780
Yeah, yeah.

2543
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:36,700
Zuno, loot, loot!

2544
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,540
Oh my god.

2545
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:39,880
I don't think I ult this.

2546
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,380
Deful, def-hold.

2547
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,520
Actually, maybe I can.

2548
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,120
Wait, uh...

2549
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,020
Oh, I got hit.

2550
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,060
How many of you just like...

2551
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:48,320
Rad Jeff!

2552
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,260
Hawkeye one, Hawkeye one, Hawkeye one.

2553
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,020
Hawkeye's the only one.

2554
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:51,580
Hawkeye's the only one.

2555
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:51,980
Nice, nice.

2556
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,240
It's still winnable.

2557
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,040
Point, point, point, point, point, point, point.

2558
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:55,540
I know.

2559
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,060
It's fine.

2560
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:57,800
Just back out.

2561
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,240
Just die.

2562
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,320
Thor was fucking glued to me.

2563
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:00,960
Holy shit.

2564
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:02,700
Almost got air in here.

2565
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,900
I don't think, I don't think they have anything.

2566
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,560
If I build out really fast here, we can go early.

2567
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:07,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2568
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:07,700
We can.

2569
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:08,360
Did he use...

2570
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,120
They have strange ult.

2571
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,200
They have strange ult.

2572
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,720
They have strange ult.

2573
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:14,340
We're down, we're down 2 right now.

2574
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:14,820
Just be careful, careful.

2575
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:15,700
Yep, yep, yep.

2576
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,140
I feel stronger today.

2577
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,520
I just have spotted Hawkeye.

2578
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,740
I can bubble you whenever, Gil.

2579
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:23,440
Okay.

2580
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,600
All right, I'm gonna go 3, 2, 1.

2581
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,260
It'll be you.

2582
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,040
They're full strange ult.

2583
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,020
She let me, she lift.

2584
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:29,820
Yeah, yeah.

2585
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,140
You can walk me?

2586
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,520
Walk out, walk out one, walk out one.

2587
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,500
Walk out action one.

2588
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:35,760
Walk out one.

2589
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:35,920
Walk out one.

2590
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,280
We have Thor on backline, we have Thor on backline.

2591
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:53,400
Keep in pocket.

2592
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,540
Fuckin' shit.

2593
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,680
So talk about...

2594
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,200
This is huge.

2595
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,120
Yup, yup.

2596
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,160
They used Thor ult there.

2597
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,240
And they used Thor and Strange ult, so they don't have that.

2598
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:08,920
Thor and Strange ults.

2599
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,640
They should have another Luna ult.

2600
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,520
They're gonna have Rocket ult soon.

2601
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,320
And Luna too.

2602
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,400
Did they use Hawkeye?

2603
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:18,820
All at all?

2604
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,680
I think he has again.

2605
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,680
They did have one fight.

2606
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,300
Yeah, okay, so they'll have that.

2607
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,780
Yeah, just keep targeting the Hawkeye.

2608
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:26,940
I think that's the win condition.

2609
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:30,400
Did we say Mantis ult for Hawkeye ult?

2610
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,440
Oh yeah, press E.

2611
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,240
Lydia, press E so you can give us our shields.

2612
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,040
Just make sure your damage boosts me, by the way, before we go for E, Zombie.

2613
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:41,420
Appreciate it.

2614
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,800
Let's freaking go.

2615
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,140
Okay, just run and press E again after.

2616
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:53,280
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

2617
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,100
Got it?

2618
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,260
Also, Lydia, if you shoot on the ground, it does more healing.

2619
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,980
And it does a bounce up.

2620
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:00,180
Am I right?

2621
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:00,520
They TPed.

2622
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,160
They TPed at top.

2623
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:01,580
Careful, careful.

2624
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,700
They do not look happy.

2625
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:04,440
They're trying to do it early.

2626
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,040
They have a Wolverine?

2627
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:05,360
Yeah.

2628
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,180
I'll save my shipper.

2629
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,540
I'm gonna have to save a bubble for myself, Gale.

2630
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:10,400
Do they still have Hawkeye?

2631
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,220
No, they have Wolverine now.

2632
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:12,680
Alright, go for it.

2633
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,340
Go for Rocket or Luna.

2634
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:15,940
Rocket or Luna.

2635
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:16,640
Go for supports.

2636
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,120
Any other supports you got here?

2637
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,240
I can't Bumble.

2638
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:19,820
Bubba you again.

2639
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:23,100
Okay, I'm going.

2640
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:23,940
Luna we're going.

2641
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:24,100
Luna's feeding.

2642
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,620
Luna one lambda one, I gotta Luna.

2643
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,640
Stay point Tyler one, stay point Tyler one.

2644
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,520
I'm going forward, okay.

2645
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,020
You guys therap.

2646
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:33,960
SOTO I'm going forward.

2647
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:34,640
Little one's strange.

2648
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:35,020
Little one's strange.

2649
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:35,420
Little one's strange.

2650
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:36,980
Nice.

2651
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,540
Thor on us.

2652
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,780
Thor on our 있는 Rocks every one.

2653
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,260
No passive, no passive, no passive.

2654
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:42,760
He's one HP.

2655
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:44,900
It's fine.

2656
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:45,440
It's fine.

2657
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:45,560
It's fine.

2658
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:45,600
It's fine.

2659
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:45,800
Sorry.

2660
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,180
I got it.

2661
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,040
I have ult.

2662
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,820
We have so much.

2663
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:52,240
Okay.

2664
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:52,960
Which one first?

2665
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,080
Mantis or Rocket first?

2666
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,280
Choose either so you don't double.

2667
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,160
Wait.

2668
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,500
Wait, Tyler.

2669
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,040
Can you hide?

2670
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,320
Can you climb on the wall up here?

2671
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:58,940
Mantis first.

2672
01:27:59,240 --> 01:27:59,480
Okay, Lydia.

2673
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,360
Don't ult yet.

2674
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:03,560
Mantis first.

2675
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,080
So Lydia, don't ult until after Mantis.

2676
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,260
And then when I bubble Gale, you just go with him.

2677
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:08,860
Okay.

2678
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,220
Get ready, Tyler.

2679
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:11,380
Ready?

2680
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:13,140
Three, two, one.

2681
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:13,440
Go, go.

2682
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,280
Rocket one, rocket one.

2683
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:17,500
Oh, I got...

2684
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,180
Jeff the rocket ult.

2685
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,060
Can we break the rocket ult?

2686
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:20,740
Oh, no.

2687
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,120
He has to split out.

2688
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:22,960
He split both of us.

2689
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:24,600
Oh, I'm gonna get ult.

2690
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,240
Oh, me too.

2691
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:26,960
Oh, I couldn't get anything.

2692
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,180
Oh, okay.

2693
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,200
Oh, I'm gonna die to Wolverine maybe.

2694
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:31,420
I can ult here.

2695
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,200
Just live.

2696
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:32,500
Just live.

2697
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:32,760
Just live.

2698
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:33,040
Just live.

2699
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:33,500
Whoa.

2700
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,160
That's a big ult.

2701
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,020
Stay on point.

2702
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:36,960
If you stay on point, I can ult.

2703
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:37,580
Can you grab me with that?

2704
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:38,460
Yeah, yeah.

2705
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,160
I'm gonna die though.

2706
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:41,680
Yeah...

2707
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,640
Strange ult.

2708
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,700
You got points so we should back up.

2709
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:48,720
I'm one HP.

2710
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:49,640
I'm one HP.

2711
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:50,520
Oopsie.

2712
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:51,660
No, it's fine.

2713
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,320
Can you... can you get to me?

2714
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:54,680
Yeah, I'm polls.

2715
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:55,540
Good.

2716
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,120
Okay, I'm good.

2717
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,440
They should have strange ult here.

2718
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:00,540
Oh, you have ult.

2719
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:00,820
You have ult.

2720
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:00,980
Okay.

2721
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:01,460
You have ult.

2722
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:01,720
I have ult.

2723
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,100
I've ult here.

2724
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,020
I just realized I was muted.

2725
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:04,720
Sorry, sorry.

2726
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:07,400
Not sure when I said it, but just shout at me if you want me to ult.

2727
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,740
Shout at me if you want me to do anything.

2728
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,080
Luna's getting a little one, little one.

2729
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:11,040
Is it?

2730
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:12,420
And Strange is gonna have a backline, be careful.

2731
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:13,820
I want to hold myself.

2732
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,720
That's fine, I have shift here to press.

2733
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,720
Yeah, throw one, throw one, throw one, throw one.

2734
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,360
I'm blocking, I'm blocking.

2735
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:23,900
I can't help.

2736
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,540
The storage is kinda inting.

2737
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,420
I have to, I'm shifting.

2738
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,600
You're fine I think, I think you're fine.

2739
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,300
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

2740
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,680
I can bubble you, Gale.

2741
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,600
I got this guy.

2742
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,040
He's one, he's all, he's passive.

2743
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,560
I'm gonna walk in here.

2744
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:47,260
There's a, there's a Thor in our backline, we have to kill the Thor.

2745
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:48,980
I'm bad.

2746
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:50,460
I'm contestant.

2747
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:51,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2748
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:53,880
Keep that.

2749
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:56,380
Oh, we ulted, we gotta fight, we gotta fight.

2750
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:56,800
We ulted.

2751
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:57,780
That's okay, that's okay.

2752
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,940
We got this.

2753
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,640
Oh, rocket one, rocket one.

2754
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:01,700
Huge ult, huge ult.

2755
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:02,420
Strange one, strange one.

2756
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,480
Oh no, I'm ulted.

2757
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:06,880
I got rid of it.

2758
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,700
Four is one, four is one.

2759
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:09,080
Strange dead.

2760
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:10,020
Jeff dead.

2761
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,740
Oh, he's a lot there.

2762
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:12,560
Good point.

2763
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,440
We got cooked, guys.

2764
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,900
They use, they use a lot too.

2765
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:16,520
That was really good.

2766
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,200
They use a lot.

2767
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,960
They, they should have Jeff ult.

2768
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:19,640
They have Jeff ult here.

2769
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,600
Lydia, Lydia, can you, can you take that one down real quick?

2770
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:23,720
Uh, push me?

2771
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2772
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:25,420
And then put it...

2773
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:25,920
Hot on the wall?

2774
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,400
Yo, listen, listen.

2775
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:30,560
When they're Jeff ult, we have to try and stay split because we don't have ult for that.

2776
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:30,900
Yeah.

2777
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:31,620
Where should I put it?

2778
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,620
Like where I am?

2779
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,000
Up here.

2780
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,120
Right over here.

2781
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:36,260
They're pushing, they're pushing, guys.

2782
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:36,940
They're walking.

2783
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:37,540
I can go over here.

2784
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:39,260
Okay, okay, okay.

2785
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:39,480
Going.

2786
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,440
Oh, I have pain.

2787
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,160
I can.

2788
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:41,460
I can.

2789
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,240
Split up, split up, split up.

2790
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,100
Split up, split up.

2791
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,060
Can you carry me?

2792
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:47,940
I got Eden.

2793
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:48,400
I got Eden.

2794
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:49,540
Me and the other split guy.

2795
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,760
I can maybe kill Jeff.

2796
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,600
He's so low!

2797
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:52,480
He's low, he's low!

2798
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:52,780
70 HP!

2799
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:53,180
50.

2800
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:53,500
40.

2801
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:53,920
30!

2802
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:54,800
Nice, nice, nice.

2803
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:55,500
Chai!

2804
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,640
Oh, should I feel on the pit?

2805
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,380
I got him, I got him, I got him!

2806
01:30:58,380 --> 01:30:58,560
Judge Lee!

2807
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,680
He used a two.

2808
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,820
Thanks, thanks, thanks, fun.

2809
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:07,240
If we can kill them late, then we win this.

2810
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:08,280
Come on, Thor.

2811
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:08,740
Kill Thor!

2812
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,380
Kill him, they don't have portal.

2813
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,340
If we kill him, they don't have portal.

2814
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,060
He's won, he's won.

2815
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,460
We'll bring one, we'll bring one can't touch.

2816
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,480
They can't have portal.

2817
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,680
Jeff is... Jeff is touching?

2818
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,040
Jeff is touching?

2819
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,380
Yeah, Jeff is touching.

2820
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:24,740
Huge.

2821
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:25,820
Huge.

2822
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,760
Nice, nice.

2823
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:30,660
Absolutely massive.

2824
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,000
Yeah, first win!

2825
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,380
I told you, first game is the warm-up.

2826
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,320
We had to figure it out.

2827
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:40,800
Yeah, I'm so sorry guys for the rocket situation last time.

2828
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,140
I was kind of thinking...

2829
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,500
If you want me to like play...

2830
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,360
So I can play Squirrel Girl, Rocket, and The Thing.

2831
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:52,860
I probably shouldn't first time a support again.

2832
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,340
I'm so sorry about that first game.

2833
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:55,360
We'll just try and do it.

2834
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,320
That was good.

2835
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:57,480
That was good.

2836
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,460
You had really good healing on Rocket.

2837
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,000
Thank you.

2838
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:00,780
Yeah.

2839
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:04,860
I think protecting Rocket is really good here.

2840
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:05,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2841
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:05,660
Yeah.

2842
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:18,440
Oh yeah, but Lydia, there's a little like rocket tech.

2843
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,560
I don't even hear it.

2844
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,600
If you shoot on the ground towards the player, it does more healing.

2845
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:24,800
Okay, okay.

2846
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:25,420
So like...

2847
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:26,420
You don't have to do that all the time.

2848
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,640
Should I like shoot at the walls?

2849
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:29,780
No, no, it's the ground.

2850
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:29,880
Or like...

2851
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:30,680
So it like bounces?

2852
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,480
Or like would that like be bad?

2853
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,180
It's just the...

2854
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:33,820
It's just the ground.

2855
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,060
I mean, walls is fine.

2856
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,980
But most likely...

2857
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,700
Best if you could aim it at the person.

2858
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:40,540
But if you shoot on the ground, the output of healing does more.

2859
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,180
So you're healing...

2860
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:42,980
So like at like feet?

2861
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:43,160
Yeah.

2862
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,240
Or like slightly below them?

2863
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,040
Or like a lot below them?

2864
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:45,900
Um, it doesn't matter.

2865
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:46,500
As long as it's on...

2866
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,200
It hits the ground.

2867
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,100
Thank you.

2868
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,540
Because I think like if we try to give you more...

2869
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,660
Because usually it is closer to them, the better.

2870
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,800
But just try and...

2871
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,560
You know, just play your most comfortable as...

2872
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:02,440
Okay, okay.

2873
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:10,650
Hey guys!

2874
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:11,550
We did it!

2875
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:13,210
We won one game!

2876
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:17,190
I'll take that win.

2877
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:23,570
I'll take the win.

2878
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:25,910
To be able to have at least one win.

2879
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:30,390
And I didn't win a single quick play match or a ranked game at all today.

2880
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,450
So...

2881
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:32,150
So...

2882
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:33,770
I take those wins.

2883
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:36,590
Anything I can get.

2884
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,410
I...

2885
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:42,210
The first win of the day.

2886
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,370
Its not too sad.

2887
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:44,710
Right?

2888
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:50,510
Warm up is officially over.

2889
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:56,650
Yippee.

2890
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,790
Not a zero win day!

2891
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,630
An improvement from last tournament.

2892
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:21,990
Oh, man, 907.

2893
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:24,110
If it's a 1-7, it's okay.

2894
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:26,330
As long as it's not 0-7.

2895
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:31,270
We're moving up in the world.

2896
01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:33,190
I'm happy to have this team.

2897
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:33,830
I'm glad I was.

2898
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:35,330
I'm glad Super picked me up.

2899
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,350
Thank God.

2900
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:41,770
Not last pick!

2901
01:34:42,990 --> 01:34:44,010
Let's go.

2902
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:45,850
Let's go.

2903
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:46,730
We'll take those.

2904
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:51,690
Oh, man.

2905
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:52,430
Oh, yeah.

2906
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:54,170
Isn't, like...

2907
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:57,770
Wait, don't we have, like, XQC's girlfriend on my team, too?

2908
01:34:58,030 --> 01:34:58,630
That's Ike.

2909
01:34:58,770 --> 01:34:59,730
That's Bliss, right?

2910
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:02,430
Oh, my God.

2911
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:02,550
Oh, my God.

2912
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:04,390
That's good.

2913
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:09,510
That's right.

2914
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:10,550
She's better.

2915
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:18,190
I think... I think XQC was... was target ulting her, too.

2916
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:22,330
That... Because, like, every... Like, those strange ults were so...

2917
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:24,330
I was like, why did he... Oh, wait.

2918
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:24,850
It's Bliss.

2919
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:25,270
Okay.

2920
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:26,650
That makes more sense.

2921
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:26,930
Like...

2922
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:28,030
Yeah!

2923
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:30,150
I was just like...

2924
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:32,870
I was like, why did...

2925
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:34,510
Why did they ult that?

2926
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:35,710
I was like, oh, yeah.

2927
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:36,350
It's this.

2928
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:40,130
It was definitely... targeted.

2929
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:49,810
VTuber beats him in a match and steals his girlfriend.

2930
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:51,350
That's fucked.

2931
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,950
No, it's a team effort, guys.

2932
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:58,050
We all stole his girlfriend.

2933
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,910
But, yeah.

2934
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:01,910
Good fucking second match, team.

2935
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:03,590
Good fucking shit.

2936
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,730
For sure.

2937
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:05,410
Oh, yay.

2938
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:06,530
Yippee.

2939
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:08,770
You know who we're playing against next?

2940
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:10,710
I don't know.

2941
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:11,310
Yeah.

2942
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:13,450
But I'm receiving word that apparently...

2943
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:16,550
Shroud's team just got a whopping zero kills against Necro.

2944
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:17,370
Yeah, they're getting cooked.

2945
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:17,650
Oh, that's...

2946
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:18,850
Nekros is playing Human Torch.

2947
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:20,050
We can't let him have that character.

2948
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:21,050
Okay.

2949
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:23,090
We will be banning Human Torch then.

2950
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:23,550
Yeah.

2951
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:24,930
Wait, Necro's...

2952
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:25,690
Wait what the?!

2953
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,310
Wait, Necro's team is pretty stacked.

2954
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:32,530
Human Torch ban into Spider-Man ban into...

2955
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:34,290
Black Panther ban.

2956
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:35,430
That's true.

2957
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:38,150
Wait, but what if they protect one of the three?

2958
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:40,610
I think...

2959
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:43,010
They're definitely going to protect Spider-Man.

2960
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,640
And we're just gonna, crazy shodgy tho...

2961
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:54,800
They're definitely gonna protect Spider-Man though, cause what if they just, yeah, they're definitely gonna protect one of those three characters.

2962
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,640
I think we just banned Venom to protect Spider-Man.

2963
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,620
Hmm, that's true.

2964
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:00,960
Would you just say?

2965
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:02,480
Wait, but we can't.

2966
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,780
Tyler1 only plays Venom.

2967
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,000
Mecros is a spider player.

2968
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,320
I only play Venom, bro.

2969
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:08,920
What do I do?

2970
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:09,600
I play Venom and Hulk.

2971
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,500
I thought you said you had a Hulk on you, no?

2972
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:11,840
I do.

2973
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:12,840
I play Venom and Hulk.

2974
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,020
Okay, then you play Hulk.

2975
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:14,800
He's got a Hulk on him.

2976
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:14,920
Yeah.

2977
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,320
You banned Spider-Man.

2978
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:16,820
Okay, did you?

2979
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:18,180
Pachichi!

2980
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:19,600
I mean, honestly though, like...

2981
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,620
I'm not even like... I feel like his Venom is pretty good.

2982
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,340
I don't... Is it worth banning?

2983
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:27,840
I mean, but then they're just gonna do... They're gonna go Guru, Venom, and Necro, Spider-Man.

2984
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,420
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

2985
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:30,720
They're gonna go...

2986
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:32,940
Spider, Venom.

2987
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:36,160
Just get rid of Venom first, and then...

2988
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,960
No, we have to get rid of Human Torch first.

2989
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:38,920
Like, no matter what.

2990
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:40,960
Yeah.

2991
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,160
We don't have any hitscam players?

2992
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:43,820
No, it doesn't matter.

2993
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,360
I mean, even against Torch is so broken.

2994
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:47,600
It's so scary.

2995
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:49,140
He's literally the Thanos of this game.

2996
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:49,600
Yeah.

2997
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,740
Like, I'm not joking.

2998
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:55,600
When I say Torch is probably the most, like, OP character I've seen in a video game.

2999
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:56,660
No, 100%.

3000
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,320
Wait, Tyler, how's your... How's your thing?

3001
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,600
You ever... You ever played Thing?

3002
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,420
Played him twice.

3003
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:02,940
I think it's pretty clunky.

3004
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,160
I can try again.

3005
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:04,560
Why?

3006
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,480
Well, I was just thinking if we don't want to ban...

3007
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:14,900
Spider-Man, we could Thing and just have you, like, camp backline, but I don't know if we want to do that.

3008
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,160
That might be a little bit...

3009
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,620
Played Thing before, the day he got released.

3010
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,600
I mean, you're either getting Thing or Hulk.

3011
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:23,960
I don't know.

3012
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,580
Both are about the same level guys.

3013
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:27,980
Fuck.

3014
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,660
I really can't play Venom.

3015
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,000
Why not?

3016
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,860
Well, we might ban Venom, but...

3017
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:33,000
Oh.

3018
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,520
Do they have a better Venom player?

3019
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:38,480
Well, they might go Spider-Man Venom because Necros plays Spider-Man.

3020
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:42,600
So if we ban Human Torx, they'll probably protect either Venom or Spider-Man.

3021
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,500
Yeah, don't protect Spider-Man.

3022
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,000
Yeah.

3023
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,720
I think we'll have to be forced to ban the Venom.

3024
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:48,640
We just can't let him have fun.

3025
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:51,380
Yeah, because, like, we won't be able to kill Necros if he has a Venom.

3026
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:52,260
Yeah.

3027
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,180
And he'll also have way more kill potential.

3028
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,640
Yeah, and also the supports will not have fun, i.e.

3029
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:58,640
all three of us.

3030
01:38:59,520 --> 01:38:59,920
Yeah.

3031
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,220
We will not have fun.

3032
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:02,520
Yeah.

3033
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:03,600
All right.

3034
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:11,540
Oh.

3035
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,500
I like this tournament so far.

3036
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:21,160
I think it's only because, um, just because, like, you know, um, I have a good team.

3037
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:21,820
I'm happy.

3038
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,480
Good team!

3039
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:25,480
Yay!

3040
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,060
Yeah, a good vibes team.

3041
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:29,460
Yeah.

3042
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,740
Also has Iron Fist, Psylocke.

3043
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,040
Yeah, but we just have to...

3044
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,560
Maybe not.

3045
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:36,020
Hold on.

3046
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:47,820
We all have to hard target the DPS because he plays the characters that are easy to, like, take easy to target the weaker players and, like, um, that's not fun.

3047
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,680
It's getting interesting.

3048
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,020
That's not fun, dude.

3049
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,420
Wait, why is our game lasting so long?

3050
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:55,740
The hell?

3051
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:56,440
Did they just start late?

3052
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,780
I think they started late, yeah.

3053
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:58,220
Yeah.

3054
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,800
Because it's domination, so...

3055
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:00,880
Yeah.

3056
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,140
It must have.

3057
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:14,470
I'm watching.

3058
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:15,230
I'm scouting.

3059
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,030
I don't know.

3060
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:16,590
Are we playing?

3061
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:17,910
We're going in Tensis team, right?

3062
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:18,730
Are we?

3063
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:20,190
We do not know.

3064
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:26,190
There's no, like, bracket thing to tell us who we're going against.

3065
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:30,630
I think the biggest thing, though, if they go Spider-Man, is just make sure our backline all just...

3066
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:33,030
Make sure you guys all look at each other all the time.

3067
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:33,370
Yeah.

3068
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:34,150
Yeah.

3069
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:34,450
Yeah.

3070
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:34,490
No.

3071
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,160
Hello, friend jumping in from production.

3072
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,160
How are y'all feeling?

3073
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,060
Great.

3074
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:42,880
Doing great.

3075
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:44,200
I'm feeling amazing.

3076
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:45,020
Excellent.

3077
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,780
I see 2-0 Felix.

3078
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:50,100
Every time that happens, I'm gifting everyone subs.

3079
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:50,800
Oh!

3080
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:51,840
Nice!

3081
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,660
Wait a minute.

3082
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,020
That was an amazing rocket play.

3083
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:57,620
Good job.

3084
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:58,920
Thank you.

3085
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,240
Really, yeah, really love it.

3086
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,980
Sorry for the slowdown on the matches.

3087
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:06,380
This first round Robin's going a little slower, but everything going forward is going to be a lot more streamlined.

3088
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:07,460
That's fine.

3089
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:07,900
That's fine.

3090
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:08,700
You guys are killing it.

3091
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,640
So yeah, keep it up.

3092
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:10,080
Talk soon.

3093
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:10,660
Thank you.

3094
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,180
Thank you.

3095
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:11,840
Thanks.

3096
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:12,200
Thanks.

3097
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:12,460
Thanks.

3098
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:16,760
Do you guys know the full mat?

3099
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,600
I'm a little confused about the full mat.

3100
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,460
So we're playing against every team, and then what happens?

3101
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:31,640
We play against every team once, and then the two teams with the best record have a bye, and then the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed.

3102
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,100
Wait, guys, go to drafting channel.

3103
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,300
No, the best two teams are going to fight each other the first round.

3104
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:37,380
Drafting?

3105
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:38,840
Okay, okay.

3106
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:39,580
Is that a bye?

3107
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:41,280
I just want to make sure.

3108
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:42,260
Oh, that's us.

3109
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:45,800
Okay, so wait.

3110
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:46,160
What is this?

3111
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,500
This is the...

3112
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:51,440
That's like who we're fighting against next.

3113
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:51,940
Oh, so we play...

3114
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:52,540
Oh, we play...

3115
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,180
We play ten...

3116
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:53,620
Oh, should we...

3117
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:54,160
Oh, okay.

3118
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,920
Yeah, we play ten's team.

3119
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,020
And then we play shroud on round four.

3120
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,660
Okay, so what do we ban on ten's team then?

3121
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,500
Well, let's look at the cheat sheet, shall we?

3122
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,260
I'm going to look at the...

3123
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,520
Oh.

3124
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:08,800
Oh, Ml7?

3125
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:09,440
Oh, Loki?

3126
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,980
Tenz is practicing torch right now, so...

3127
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:15,940
I think...

3128
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,780
Because Ml7 plays a lot of Luna.

3129
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:19,520
I think...

3130
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,340
I think they have a Luna one turn.

3131
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:25,020
I think we literally just banned Luna.

3132
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:26,720
Protect Rocket.

3133
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:30,360
Ban either Mag or Hela.

3134
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,040
Probably Hela.

3135
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,380
Because Tenz is like, you know, really good at aiming.

3136
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:34,980
I think...

3137
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:37,640
And also just like, I think we got owned by Hela.

3138
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:38,760
You don't think he's gonna...

3139
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:40,560
No, I don't think human torch.

3140
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,780
I don't think they have a torch player.

3141
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,000
I saw Tenz...

3142
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,400
I saw Tenz was just practicing human torch in the practice range, but I don't know if he's been playing him.

3143
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:48,580
I don't...

3144
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:51,240
I don't know if he's like that nice on it yet.

3145
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:51,460
Yeah.

3146
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,080
Yeah, that's true.

3147
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,820
I think we can do good against it.

3148
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:54,260
Nice.

3149
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,100
And then we protect Hulk, which will bait out the...

3150
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,540
Namorban.

3151
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:03,760
And then probably ban like Psylocke maybe last.

3152
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:07,380
Are you worried about ML7's freaking Loki or what?

3153
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:08,780
Uh...

3154
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:12,020
I think his Luna is more worthy of a ban.

3155
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:16,460
I'm just worried that his Loki is gonna just completely like make our Venom Dive kind of ass.

3156
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,260
That's true.

3157
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:21,020
Because that would be a problem.

3158
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:24,360
I think he DPSed a lot as Loki.

3159
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:25,980
So if we...

3160
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:26,220
Oh, does he?

3161
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,260
Like do picks in the backline, yeah.

3162
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:30,580
We'll probably do his ban.

3163
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,420
I mean...

3164
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:34,860
I really...

3165
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:38,060
I really would like the Luna fan more or the Loki.

3166
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,320
We can do Luna if you think...

3167
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,700
Yeah, I think Luna's gonna be more of a problem.

3168
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:42,960
I think Luna's gonna be more of a problem.

3169
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:44,680
Um...

3170
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:44,820
All right.

3171
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:49,120
I know like he's gonna hit every freeze on Tyler if he...

3172
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:53,140
I think that's all the...

3173
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:55,340
Well, because on their team, they have a guy, Epic Whale.

3174
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:56,740
I think he only plays Luna.

3175
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:58,640
Ah, I see.

3176
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,100
He only plays Luna, yeah.

3177
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:01,460
All right.

3178
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:02,680
Okay, yeah, that's just fine.

3179
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,440
But then like, I was gonna say you could transfer it.

3180
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:09,300
Get him off their comfort pick and I think that's really valuable.

3181
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:10,180
That's fine.

3182
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:11,040
Okay.

3183
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:13,680
Cool.

3184
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:22,070
That's some nice heroes.

3185
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:26,910
Yeah, imagine being a Luna OTP.

3186
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:28,030
Sorry, that was a different person.

3187
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:29,110
That was a different person.

3188
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:30,510
Actually, it can't be me.

3189
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:32,470
I had to like, get out of being a Luna OTP.

3190
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:36,790
So, are we about to play another?

3191
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:37,470
Yep.

3192
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:37,830
They just invited us.

3193
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:38,390
Yeah, we're about to...

3194
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:39,190
They just invited, yeah.

3195
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,740
Apparently, J3's team is going triple res too.

3196
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,220
Or Summit's team.

3197
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:51,240
Yeah.

3198
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:51,560
Oh, okay.

3199
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:54,700
Yeah, they're doing triple res with Raccoon as well.

3200
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,620
Who on their team, on Summit's team you said?

3201
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:59,900
Yeah, Summit's team is doing triple res with Raccoon.

3202
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:05,780
So, I don't know if we need to ban a protect Raccoon, but I don't know if that guy...

3203
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,360
He's playing Star-Lord.

3204
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:07,040
Is it J3?

3205
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:07,660
Yeah.

3206
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,120
No, Gale, you got that or what?

3207
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,820
Yeah, are you going to get dissed by J3?

3208
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:13,180
No, I got that.

3209
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,180
Jason the third?

3210
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:14,880
Don't you worry.

3211
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:15,820
Don't you worry.

3212
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,520
I got that.

3213
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,600
Is he going to win against you in a 1v1?

3214
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,200
Not even a question.

3215
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:23,140
Don't even worry about it.

3216
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:24,400
Hey, Gale's shot.

3217
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,740
If he dies in J3, remember to clip it.

3218
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:28,780
No screenshots.

3219
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,440
Well, so what does Summit play then?

3220
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:34,240
Does he play support?

3221
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:37,240
I think he's on tank, right?

3222
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,340
Or support?

3223
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,420
No, he's on Adam.

3224
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:45,860
Yeah, he's on Adam.

3225
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:48,980
Okay, okay.

3226
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,460
Your DPS is Daltoosh and Tens, which is obvious.

3227
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,560
Oh wait, not DPS, sorry.

3228
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:58,640
I meant Tens team, but...

3229
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:00,220
Summit's team.

3230
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:01,560
I don't know, Summit is like...

3231
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,320
Oh wait, no, it is J3 and Daltoosh, yeah.

3232
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,880
So they're solo tanking.

3233
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:17,150
Yeah, literally, Tyler, if you just follow up every single time with just like the E call out, like I swear we'll win every fight.

3234
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:19,850
Wait, say that again?

3235
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:21,530
I said to Tyler.

3236
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:25,390
If Tyler follows up every single time with like the E combo, like we'll just win every fight.

3237
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:26,330
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3238
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,900
Hey, Gale and Lydia, you should be seeing an invite from Scooby Dooby Jew.

3239
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:40,900
We just need you in the lobby.

3240
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:42,080
Nice, just accept that.

3241
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:42,840
Oh, we're in.

3242
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:43,100
Thank you.

3243
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:43,640
I'm in anyway.

3244
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:44,480
Oh, I'm not in.

3245
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:44,760
Good luck, guys.

3246
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:45,660
Thank you.

3247
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:51,880
It's from Scooby Dooby Jew, right?

3248
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:53,980
Yes.

3249
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,700
All right, I'll request to join.

3250
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,380
I realized I was...

3251
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:58,000
Oh, no.

3252
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:01,520
I'll whisper, please invite me.

3253
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,320
Let me in.

3254
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:16,040
Let me in.

3255
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:22,440
Yeah, Scooby Dooby Jew is right here.

3256
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,520
Right here.

3257
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:26,360
And I'm not in.

3258
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:27,720
Let me in.

3259
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,080
Yeah, we're fighting Ten's team next.

3260
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,400
What if I invite him?

3261
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:40,100
I put him in my lobby.

3262
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,300
What is it?

3263
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,200
Add Gale.

3264
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,980
I'll add his diamond to your account.

3265
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,280
Wait, I could just request...

3266
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:02,960
Oh, god damn it.

3267
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,680
What is desert years?

3268
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,980
My lobby now?

3269
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:18,800
Why?

3270
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,080
Why won't they let me in?

3271
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:24,300
Don't understand!

3272
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:27,100
What have I done wrong?

3273
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,160
I think we're just missing Doki.

3274
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:34,940
Yeah, I whispered a Scooby Dooby Jew to invite me, but I don't think they saw the whispering.

3275
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,880
All right, I'll go let him know.

3276
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,520
Appreciate you.

3277
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:39,320
You're good.

3278
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:39,640
You're good.

3279
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:43,400
It's just, I tried everything I could!

3280
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:51,450
Sad face.

3281
01:48:55,930 --> 01:48:57,690
I don't understand.

3282
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:00,650
Why is he ignoring me?

3283
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:01,530
I'm good.

3284
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:04,510
I feel so much hurt after getting Rocket.

3285
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:07,710
You know, I was like, I didn't like speak after that first game.

3286
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:09,450
Yeah, I get you.

3287
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:13,610
Oh yeah, I also added you so you can invite me to love you.

3288
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:15,710
Yo, by the way guys, I am fucking cuck.

3289
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,590
What's wrong?

3290
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:16,970
What's wrong?

3291
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:17,290
What's wrong?

3292
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:20,510
I started the tournament high energy, fucking everything.

3293
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:22,690
My brain has exploded.

3294
01:49:22,690 --> 01:49:26,810
With the calls, the shit on my screen, everything.

3295
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:29,590
I am like jelly in the brain right now.

3296
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:31,110
Oh, shit.

3297
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:32,090
I'm doing fine, right?

3298
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:32,810
I think I'm doing fine.

3299
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:33,530
No, you are.

3300
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:34,350
No, you actually are.

3301
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:37,010
Just, if we're playing that comp, just keep doing what you're doing.

3302
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:41,370
Just keep following up when I, when Gale goes in and I bubble him and you just dive with him, it's easy every time.

3303
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:49,430
Because it's actually so much to listen to you guys, like, like, I'm not blaming you guys, but you can keep doing, I'm just saying, uh, it's like high elo players.

3304
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:50,990
I literally don't even understand the game.

3305
01:49:51,090 --> 01:49:56,310
You guys are like calling shit that I don't, like, it's, it's literally, like, it's like, another fucking language.

3306
01:49:57,630 --> 01:49:58,810
It is so much.

3307
01:49:59,330 --> 01:50:01,430
We gotta say terms that everyone knows.

3308
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:02,630
Yes, exactly.

3309
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:03,030
No, I get you.

3310
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,970
Alright, so am I going to Venom here or not?

3311
01:50:08,630 --> 01:50:11,730
Yeah, yeah, this comp here, you're gonna, you're gonna be playing Venom.

3312
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:13,530
It must be game, which hopefully they don't, but.

3313
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:18,050
Alright, I got our band figured out.

3314
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:18,750
Eh.

3315
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:19,650
Don't worry, guys.

3316
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:20,810
You got this shit?

3317
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:21,930
I hope everybody is.

3318
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:23,870
You guys, you guys can hear everyone in this grade.

3319
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:25,130
I know I typed it out, but I forgot.

3320
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:27,130
Good.

3321
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:29,650
I didn't, I forgot if everyone was okay.

3322
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:30,970
Yep.

3323
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:33,630
Oh my gosh, thank you.

3324
01:50:36,210 --> 01:50:36,850
That's good.

3325
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:38,550
Very good.

3326
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:40,930
Okay, mag protect.

3327
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:43,050
It's fine, I'll play mag.

3328
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:45,130
I guess I'm on full-time mag duty, bro.

3329
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,910
Yippee.

3330
01:50:58,090 --> 01:50:58,830
What is it?

3331
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:03,410
Where's your other DPS?

3332
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:05,790
They're scared of your Wolverine.

3333
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:06,690
I guess, bro.

3334
01:51:07,110 --> 01:51:07,370
I guess so.

3335
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,330
When was the last time you played Wolverine, though?

3336
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:11,490
Dude, honestly, it's kind of hard to play Wolverine.

3337
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:11,590
Yeah.

3338
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:12,730
It's like Emma and Thing now.

3339
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:15,350
Like, I mean, you could still make it work, but.

3340
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:15,750
Yeah.

3341
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:16,910
I guess they banned Emma.

3342
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:18,850
I don't think I've seen you on Wolverine in so long.

3343
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:19,850
Yeah.

3344
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:24,790
If they didn't ban Emma, then I don't think it would have been an issue.

3345
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:26,550
Oh, they're gonna, but Emma's gonna be on low-key.

3346
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:28,330
This is a low-key map, too.

3347
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:29,450
Yeah, it's good.

3348
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:34,360
Okay.

3349
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,400
And then who do you want to ban last?

3350
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:40,200
I mean, it could be Psylocke.

3351
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:42,380
Yeah, they banned Emma, though.

3352
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:44,160
I think.

3353
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:48,550
I mean, we could.

3354
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:50,910
Hear me out, hear me out.

3355
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:52,030
This covers this.

3356
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,510
Oh, yeah?

3357
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:53,970
Because we're going to go triple res.

3358
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:56,710
In case they decide to go that.

3359
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:57,950
Oh, yeah.

3360
01:51:58,470 --> 01:51:59,590
Oh, I see what you mean.

3361
01:51:59,790 --> 01:51:59,950
Okay.

3362
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:01,670
Because you ban- Yeah, okay, I see what you mean.

3363
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:02,470
Yeah, yeah.

3364
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:04,430
My only problem is, what if they go, like, Groot thing?

3365
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:05,970
Then we don't have Punisher for it.

3366
01:52:07,110 --> 01:52:08,110
I think it's okay.

3367
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:09,130
You think so?

3368
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:09,570
All right.

3369
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:10,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3370
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:12,230
Who would play Groot, though, on their team?

3371
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:15,410
Who's like- I don't think they have a good enough tank player to be able to play Groot.

3372
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:18,670
Also, if they go Torch, we might just be- Iron Man.

3373
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:19,390
Iron Man.

3374
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:19,990
Interesting.

3375
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:24,270
Okay, we- Uh, I think- Torch, we might be in a problem.

3376
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:24,950
I'm not judging.

3377
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:26,350
No, they don't- they don't have a Torch player.

3378
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:26,930
This universe.

3379
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:32,130
At best, the only DPS player I know there is Tens, and...

3380
01:52:33,530 --> 01:52:34,770
I don't think...

3381
01:52:35,570 --> 01:52:38,710
I don't think they have a DPS player that can play Torch at a high enough level.

3382
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:40,370
Who's Desert Years?

3383
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:43,210
I- I don't think they have a Torch player.

3384
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:43,430
Mendo.

3385
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:44,630
Oh, is that Mendo?

3386
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:44,990
Oh, wait.

3387
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:45,690
That's Mendo?

3388
01:52:45,930 --> 01:52:46,470
Okay, so...

3389
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:49,690
Mendo will play Atom, probably, maybe?

3390
01:52:49,690 --> 01:52:58,330
No, they already have three support players with fans, uh, with fans, ML7 and, uh, Epic Whale.

3391
01:52:58,510 --> 01:53:02,510
So Mendo might- I don't think he has practice enough to play Torch at a high level.

3392
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:05,470
Uh, I'll- I mean, if the- if he does...

3393
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:10,210
I saw him playing Delta Force, so I don't think so.

3394
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:10,930
Yo, call me crazy.

3395
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:11,870
Call me crazy.

3396
01:53:12,030 --> 01:53:20,870
If he goes Torch and it's a problem, maybe we go Spider-Man and with Venom and just combo him out so he can't do anything.

3397
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:23,670
How confident on your Spider-Man.

3398
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:24,350
Yeah, yeah.

3399
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,970
Ah, I rarely have played him.

3400
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:30,630
I- I think, honestly, we just went on this.

3401
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:31,210
Uh...

3402
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:31,750
Oh, we'll see.

3403
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:32,050
We'll see.

3404
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:32,570
We need a swap.

3405
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:32,950
We'll see.

3406
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:33,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3407
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:36,030
I- I think- I think also Trooper Razz is just good in the- Yeah.

3408
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:37,170
All right, let's go.

3409
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:38,930
All right, Tonka.

3410
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:39,270
Also, careful.

3411
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:40,890
They might have a Spider-Man to hook off the map here.

3412
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:41,570
Just be careful.

3413
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:42,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3414
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,030
I don't think they have Spider-Man to hook off the map here.

3415
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:45,510
Probably not, but just be careful.

3416
01:53:46,590 --> 01:53:48,070
Whoa, whoops, I actually pressed Zip, please.

3417
01:53:48,110 --> 01:53:48,630
Hey, darn Bucky.

3418
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:49,850
Is that Scroll Girl, Scroll Girl?

3419
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:50,990
Oh, shit.

3420
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:55,030
So, the Loki's gonna be Perma sitting in the- the back room.

3421
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:55,690
Who do I hit?

3422
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:56,170
Who do I hit?

3423
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:58,070
Oh, wait till they come out.

3424
01:53:58,230 --> 01:53:58,810
Wait till they come out.

3425
01:53:58,830 --> 01:53:58,870
Yeah, yeah.

3426
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:01,690
The cosmic might return.

3427
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:02,890
Okay, I'm gonna go for you, go for you.

3428
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:03,010
Ready?

3429
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:03,950
Yeah, I'll help you.

3430
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,870
They used the lamp.

3431
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:09,350
Maybe just capped here?

3432
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:09,930
Just capped here?

3433
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:11,170
Capping here.

3434
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:12,550
Can you just back tell her?

3435
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:14,250
Hi, I'm gonna have to soulbound for you.

3436
01:54:14,410 --> 01:54:15,090
They just gave a point.

3437
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:25,590
I use both snaps.

3438
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:29,430
I don't... I can't heal, I can't heal.

3439
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:30,990
Nice, nice.

3440
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:32,870
Do you have bubble gun?

3441
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:33,890
Yeah, I do, I do.

3442
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:35,130
They use res?

3443
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:36,110
They have no rocky res.

3444
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:38,290
I'm marked, alright, just chill.

3445
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:40,230
I'm total, just wait, just wait, I'm total.

3446
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:41,950
They use lip, they use lip.

3447
01:54:41,950 --> 01:54:43,250
Okay, I'm backing out here.

3448
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:45,070
Can we break the scroll goal?

3449
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:45,690
I can't break it, break it.

3450
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:49,090
I can res though, I can res.

3451
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:50,550
Mag, mag, mag, mag.

3452
01:54:50,910 --> 01:54:51,770
Mag's one, mag's one.

3453
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:52,850
Oh shit.

3454
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:54,870
I almost have ult to play alive.

3455
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:56,190
Should I ult?

3456
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:57,930
Just tell me when you guys... No, no, no, no, no.

3457
01:54:58,030 --> 01:54:59,710
Just wait until this is over.

3458
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:00,490
We'll tell you when he'll ult.

3459
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:01,410
Just wait, just wait.

3460
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:02,910
Ult, ult, ult.

3461
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:04,270
Go for it, go for it.

3462
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:04,870
Get a rocket ult.

3463
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:06,010
Rocket ult, rocket ult.

3464
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:06,550
Nice.

3465
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:08,290
I'm gonna go back.

3466
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:09,410
Oh, he's solo.

3467
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:09,490
I'm solo.

3468
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,170
I solo botted us.

3469
01:55:13,690 --> 01:55:14,870
We should live, we should live.

3470
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:17,250
I want Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

3471
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:19,310
Okay, just live, just live, just live.

3472
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:20,930
I can res, I can resist.

3473
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:21,830
This might be a bad res.

3474
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:22,650
This is a bad res though.

3475
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:23,410
Yeah.

3476
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:25,250
I can.

3477
01:55:26,290 --> 01:55:27,310
Good Venom all, good Venom all.

3478
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:29,070
I can bubble you again, where are you?

3479
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:29,930
Here, here.

3480
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:30,370
Almost you.

3481
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:31,390
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

3482
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:34,050
We can focus on healers.

3483
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:34,790
I want Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

3484
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:35,610
Yeah, we're coming back.

3485
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:38,650
That's fine.

3486
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:39,670
That's fine.

3487
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:42,690
I couldn't res anywhere else.

3488
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:45,150
You guys want me to hit any squirrels now, right?

3489
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:47,810
It's kind of hard.

3490
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:51,030
Maybe go for Squirrel Go, but you have to be careful because they can hook and stun you.

3491
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:53,390
So if you use your E, just instantly get out.

3492
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:54,970
Get that up.

3493
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:59,350
Gale can call when he goes in.

3494
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:00,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3495
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:02,530
You guys can walk up.

3496
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,010
Yeah, I'm walking in.

3497
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:05,050
I have bubble for you.

3498
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,770
I'm in too right side.

3499
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:09,950
I can bubble you go.

3500
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:10,930
Okay, going?

3501
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:12,030
Yep, help you.

3502
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:12,570
I got you.

3503
01:56:13,690 --> 01:56:14,250
I couldn't.

3504
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:15,450
I got stunned.

3505
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:16,230
Do you have res?

3506
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:17,450
No, I know.

3507
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:17,650
I know.

3508
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:18,250
It's fine.

3509
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:18,510
It's fine.

3510
01:56:19,370 --> 01:56:20,130
Squirrel Go, Squirrel.

3511
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:20,870
She's out.

3512
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:22,750
Break the lamp, break the lamps.

3513
01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:25,190
I'm coming back now.

3514
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:25,710
Okay, just kite, just kite.

3515
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:26,550
That's fine, that's fine.

3516
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:28,410
It's probably res.

3517
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:30,550
I don't have... Oh, nice.

3518
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:30,990
It's not the map.

3519
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:31,250
Nice.

3520
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:32,990
We're back.

3521
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:34,270
Can we go in back then?

3522
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:36,150
I'm done.

3523
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:36,290
Go back then?

3524
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:36,670
Go back then?

3525
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:38,630
Uh, yeah, can you go, Tyler?

3526
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:40,130
Yeah, yeah, I'll go.

3527
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:40,990
Squirrel Go, 1.

3528
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:41,290
Squirrel Go, 1.

3529
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:41,630
Squirrel Go, 1.

3530
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,970
Squirrel Go, 1.

3531
01:56:44,330 --> 01:56:45,110
I have to slow down.

3532
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:45,650
I have to slow down.

3533
01:56:45,710 --> 01:56:46,570
There was a mag on me.

3534
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:48,590
Look, I got 1 too.

3535
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:49,170
I'm ulting this.

3536
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:50,870
Should I ult?

3537
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:51,410
Should I ult?

3538
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:52,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3539
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:52,830
I got 2, I got 2.

3540
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:54,070
No, no, no, no.

3541
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:55,490
It's fine, it's fine.

3542
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:56,170
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3543
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:56,710
Let's get ult.

3544
01:56:57,270 --> 01:56:57,730
Squirrel Go, 1.

3545
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:58,290
Loki, Loki.

3546
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:01,670
He doesn't have ult anymore.

3547
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:02,830
Kill them, kill them.

3548
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:04,630
They use low-key ult.

3549
01:57:04,730 --> 01:57:05,210
They use low-key ult.

3550
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:06,210
Okay, Lydia.

3551
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:06,550
Lydia.

3552
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:07,550
Come here.

3553
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:10,970
And then right there.

3554
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:12,030
Oh, right here.

3555
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:12,470
Do you see it?

3556
01:57:12,590 --> 01:57:13,950
I'm the plant.

3557
01:57:14,170 --> 01:57:14,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3558
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:15,570
Here, you see me.

3559
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:16,190
See me right here.

3560
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:18,790
Okay, right here.

3561
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:20,050
They're pushing, they're pushing.

3562
01:57:20,330 --> 01:57:20,550
Lydia move.

3563
01:57:21,650 --> 01:57:22,930
Okay, okay, okay.

3564
01:57:23,550 --> 01:57:24,210
I'll wait, I'll wait.

3565
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:27,910
So, if you put that there, it's gonna break.

3566
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:29,410
So, if we put it over here...

3567
01:57:29,410 --> 01:57:30,230
How about where you go?

3568
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:33,490
Just play, just play, just play the game.

3569
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:34,190
Just play the game.

3570
01:57:34,690 --> 01:57:36,230
Yes, we're gonna finish, we're gonna finish, we're gonna finish.

3571
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:36,690
I'm stunned.

3572
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,670
Mag one too.

3573
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:42,590
Mag one, Mag one, Mag one.

3574
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:44,150
He's cheering, he's cheering.

3575
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:46,230
Watch, Bucky go look at the map, baby.

3576
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:47,050
Can you kill Bucky?

3577
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:49,470
I so bonded, I so bonded us.

3578
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:51,310
Bucky won.

3579
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:52,030
Nice.

3580
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:54,650
Did he just kill himself?

3581
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:55,450
Oh no, he's good.

3582
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:56,910
No, he tried killing me, but he didn't.

3583
01:57:57,850 --> 01:57:59,490
Wait, what were you guys talking about?

3584
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,530
Wait, what were you guys talking about?

3585
01:58:00,530 --> 01:58:01,530
Good shit, good shit.

3586
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:01,870
Let's go.

3587
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:06,390
I'm so sorry.

3588
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:08,270
Wait, what does your champs look like?

3589
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:11,950
And I'm still there, I never know, like, who you are, which one you are.

3590
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:13,030
Green plant?

3591
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:16,790
If you follow me, I'll tell you where to put the E's, so...

3592
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:17,230
Okay, okay.

3593
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:18,730
So it doesn't get killed.

3594
01:58:18,730 --> 01:58:20,290
He's supposed to use his power for God.

3595
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:21,690
Sorry.

3596
01:58:22,850 --> 01:58:27,690
The E, you just use the E to hide your E's so they can't destroy it.

3597
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:29,690
That's what Alyssa was trying to teach.

3598
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:30,330
Oh!

3599
01:58:30,490 --> 01:58:35,610
But I had to, I had to like, like, snap them up because we were getting a fight.

3600
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:36,610
Yeah.

3601
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,150
I could tell Lydia was getting overwhelmed.

3602
01:58:38,150 --> 01:58:42,610
Tyler, when you're, when you're wall climbing, you can, uh, like, slam down when you're wall climbing.

3603
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:44,450
You don't have to always swing for it, by the way.

3604
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:44,990
Yup.

3605
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:49,130
So if you want, you can, like, camp angles and stuff.

3606
01:58:49,570 --> 01:58:50,410
Just this, Gale!

3607
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:51,790
What's that?

3608
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:53,950
Stop backstay gaming me, Gale!

3609
01:58:54,830 --> 01:58:55,910
You piece of shit!

3610
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:56,950
You got that.

3611
01:58:58,010 --> 01:58:58,790
You got that.

3612
01:58:58,930 --> 01:58:59,410
Alright, let's win.

3613
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:02,710
Alright, fighting team.

3614
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:04,750
Alright, I have Rez here.

3615
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:09,070
I'm gonna go for the healers, guys.

3616
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:10,130
Yup.

3617
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:14,030
You gotta be careful when the Loki puts his green things up.

3618
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:14,870
Those green little ores.

3619
01:59:14,990 --> 01:59:17,150
You have to break those, otherwise you won't kill anybody.

3620
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:17,850
Okay.

3621
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:19,990
Alright, ready?

3622
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,590
I mean, I'm gonna be able to go ahead.

3623
01:59:23,310 --> 01:59:24,230
Oh, they have Namor now, by the way.

3624
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:25,550
That's not as much.

3625
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:27,630
They don't even have full.

3626
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:28,230
They're terrible.

3627
01:59:28,490 --> 01:59:28,930
Namor half.

3628
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:30,570
Mag is low!

3629
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:31,190
Mag is low!

3630
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:33,750
Oh no, it's 5x, it's 5x I got their beak!

3631
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:34,850
Oh no, I'm melting, melting, melting.

3632
01:59:36,090 --> 01:59:36,950
Shooting it, shooting it.

3633
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:37,590
Yeah, I'm shooting it.

3634
01:59:38,410 --> 01:59:39,890
Beacons working in the back, Gale, if you can find it.

3635
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:42,570
I have all my stuff no purple for you, Gale.

3636
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:44,310
Do we have all- available for you, Gale.

3637
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:46,010
I think you're still about here.

3638
01:59:48,650 --> 01:59:50,290
Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

3639
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:50,810
Wait, Bucky!

3640
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:51,550
I got... I got Bucky, weird!

3641
01:59:52,890 --> 01:59:54,210
I want Loki, on the mega?

3642
01:59:54,430 --> 01:59:55,250
I got Loki.

3643
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:55,650
I got Loki.

3644
01:59:56,070 --> 01:59:58,470
I got Loki, where are you?

3645
01:59:58,470 --> 01:59:59,990
I'm on Cloak too, I'm on Cloak.

3646
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:01,910
Cloak is one, Cloak is one.

3647
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:03,270
One, Namor?

3648
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:03,830
Namor one?

3649
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:06,430
Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag, Cloak is on point.

3650
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:09,750
I can ult whenever you want.

3651
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:12,510
Yeah, we'll call for it.

3652
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:14,950
We might get Mantis ult first too.

3653
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:16,230
Nice.

3654
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:17,930
Nice.

3655
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:24,830
What are they going to have?

3656
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:27,790
They still have Mag ult and they have...

3657
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:30,230
I think we've got a lot of supportals before I use my ult, to be honest.

3658
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:33,310
Yeah, I'm spamming aggressively.

3659
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:34,730
Maybe I can get another ult if they let me.

3660
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:35,350
I doubt it.

3661
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:38,230
We can use each other here and then Tyler can go in and I can call out.

3662
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:38,850
Wait, they wasted land.

3663
02:00:38,930 --> 02:00:39,350
What the fuck?

3664
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:40,330
There's not land.

3665
02:00:41,970 --> 02:00:42,730
We're gonna break that, break it.

3666
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:43,990
I have the bubble for you guys.

3667
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:44,750
I'm trying to.

3668
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:46,670
It's low, it's low, it's low, it's low.

3669
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,110
I got it, I got it, I got it.

3670
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:51,410
Okay, uh, can we rock it up, rock it up, rock it up?

3671
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:52,850
Yeah, okay.

3672
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:56,610
I'm using, boy.

3673
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:57,810
That's fine.

3674
02:00:58,550 --> 02:00:59,830
Yeah, we are close to the place.

3675
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:00,970
Loki's dead.

3676
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:01,390
I got the Loki's dead, though.

3677
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:01,570
That's good.

3678
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:04,090
I don't have snaps, I don't have snaps, I'm using Sobondo.

3679
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:06,630
I'm gonna go Bucky.

3680
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:07,650
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

3681
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:09,710
Oh naturally, we don't need it.

3682
02:01:10,530 --> 02:01:11,210
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky!

3683
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:12,030
I think we've dead.

3684
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:13,790
And then more neighbors.

3685
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:16,350
Neighbor's one, neighbor's one.

3686
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:19,310
Use the, we kill, we kill neighbor here.

3687
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:19,630
Free kill.

3688
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:20,470
Yeah.

3689
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:21,250
He's locked in.

3690
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:21,830
Yeah, nice.

3691
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,450
Oh, are you okay, Tyler?

3692
02:01:23,570 --> 02:01:23,710
It's fine.

3693
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:24,510
It's fine.

3694
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:25,990
It's fine.

3695
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:29,670
They're both supports are down there.

3696
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:31,110
Do we want to go from?

3697
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:34,610
I don't know, so they're healing each other.

3698
02:01:35,010 --> 02:01:36,110
Wait, portal, portal, portal, portal!

3699
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:37,370
Oh, they TP'd.

3700
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:37,690
What the hell?

3701
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:38,710
I have to use those snaps.

3702
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:39,750
I'm good.

3703
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:42,230
I can bubble you, Gale, whenever you want.

3704
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:42,870
Okay.

3705
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:44,990
They're main, they're main.

3706
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:46,430
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking for you, whatever.

3707
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:49,230
They have Buckyall here.

3708
02:01:49,230 --> 02:01:50,430
One, three, two, one.

3709
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:51,210
What will you?

3710
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:52,710
Squirtle lock me?

3711
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:54,230
Can you use lamp?

3712
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:55,110
Can you break that thing?

3713
02:01:55,430 --> 02:01:56,930
No lamp, no lamp, no lamp.

3714
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:58,710
Got it.

3715
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:00,470
Oh, I have to use that.

3716
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:04,950
Bucky one, Bucky one, Bucky one.

3717
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:06,690
Bucky one, Bucky one!

3718
02:02:06,850 --> 02:02:07,910
I got Bucky, I got Bucky.

3719
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:11,230
I got Bucky.

3720
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:12,570
Loki's close here.

3721
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:14,630
You have to keep fighting.

3722
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:15,350
Yeah, I'm on Loki.

3723
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:15,930
I'm with you, Tyler.

3724
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:16,590
Keep fighting, keep fighting.

3725
02:02:18,190 --> 02:02:19,330
There's a Squirtle one.

3726
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:20,550
Squirtle one up top.

3727
02:02:20,770 --> 02:02:21,510
I have to reload.

3728
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:24,510
Trash me a trash fucking dog shit motherfucker.

3729
02:02:25,530 --> 02:02:26,810
That's how you fucking play!

3730
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:29,690
Nice.

3731
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:31,230
Good shit.

3732
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:35,670
There it is.

3733
02:02:36,030 --> 02:02:37,410
They just had nothing that could really mark me.

3734
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:40,710
It's like, it's Bucky and Squirrel Girl, like I'll never get hit.

3735
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:45,430
Yippee!

3736
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:50,630
Excellent work!

3737
02:02:52,090 --> 02:02:55,830
Oh my god, I'm like literally relearning Adam as I play.

3738
02:02:56,810 --> 02:03:03,710
Adam has been in jail for so fucking long, that like, I have to learn how to play Adam again.

3739
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:05,310
Yep, that was...

3740
02:03:05,310 --> 02:03:06,410
Very close.

3741
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:08,450
Good self plays.

3742
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:11,270
It's been so long.

3743
02:03:11,530 --> 02:03:14,050
He's been in Adam jail for so fucking long.

3744
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:16,710
And then when we do triple res...

3745
02:03:16,710 --> 02:03:18,410
When we do triple res comp...

3746
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:20,050
I'm not the one on Adam.

3747
02:03:20,190 --> 02:03:23,390
I'm never the one on Adam in triple res comp.

3748
02:03:23,790 --> 02:03:26,390
So I have to like, remember how to play him again.

3749
02:03:29,410 --> 02:03:30,210
Oh man.

3750
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:31,390
Oh man.

3751
02:03:31,390 --> 02:03:31,970
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3752
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:32,810
I'll be right back, guys.

3753
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:39,700
We're playing against Necrosteen's neck, right?

3754
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:40,040
Right?

3755
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:40,940
Gulp.

3756
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:41,300
Yeah.

3757
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:41,600
Okay.

3758
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,940
They're like, the scarier team.

3759
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:44,920
Yeah.

3760
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,340
I think, I think they're the best team for sure.

3761
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:47,720
Yeah.

3762
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:48,780
100%.

3763
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:52,460
Do we have a contingency plan if Rocket gets banned?

3764
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:55,940
Oh...

3765
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:57,300
Question!

3766
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:01,880
I mean, I can play squirrel girl and I can play the thing.

3767
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:05,880
I don't know why I thought it was smart.

3768
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:08,820
Because I didn't know how this was gonna go.

3769
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,820
So I was like, I don't know what role I'm gonna be.

3770
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:13,160
So then I like, prepared for different roles.

3771
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:16,360
Oh, you could go to practice range right now and try cloak.

3772
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,440
You go to practice range.

3773
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:24,440
Um, I don't think we can when we're in custom lobby.

3774
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:24,880
Oh wait.

3775
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:26,620
They said they didn't and we can't.

3776
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:28,080
Oh, we can't leave this one?

3777
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:28,660
They said they don't want you to go.

3778
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:29,920
Oh, I thought like...

3779
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:29,960
Yeah.

3780
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,340
This wasn't our survey.

3781
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:34,000
I couldn't invite...

3782
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:34,600
Oh, I was gonna say.

3783
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:36,160
I couldn't invite Nekros in right now.

3784
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:46,320
I mean, if we want to get really like, bizarre.

3785
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:58,660
I think, I think against Nekros team, probably like ban Torch, protect Rocket, probably ban Spider-Man next, then protect Adam to bait out maybe triple res.

3786
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:06,340
Um, and then, cause ideally, I think our best way to win this is Hulk Namor.

3787
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:08,700
Yeah.

3788
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:11,280
Oh, this is like, I feel like they're like a dive team, you know?

3789
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,500
I think, yeah.

3790
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:12,560
Yeah.

3791
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:13,600
I think it was...

3792
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:15,220
So bait out triple res, and then, sorry, go ahead.

3793
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:16,080
Oh, I was gonna say.

3794
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:18,100
Also, they do try to ban our Rocket.

3795
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:21,880
We agreed that me or Bliss have to play main heals.

3796
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:22,920
Hmm.

3797
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:30,880
So then like, uh, Lydia has to play either Mantis, I guess she has to play Mantis cause Adam requires more, more like thinking there.

3798
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:34,500
I mean, are you at all, like how comfortable are you on Thing, if at all?

3799
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:38,480
Like, could you play Thing and like be comfortable with it, Lydia?

3800
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:39,240
Me?

3801
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:41,260
Um, yeah.

3802
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:42,780
No one near as good as Rocket.

3803
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:49,180
Um, but a heck of a lot better than what happened first game.

3804
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:51,200
I see.

3805
02:06:52,320 --> 02:07:00,140
Cause like, if things are really rough, we could triple tank.

3806
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:03,000
But I don't know.

3807
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:06,840
I think triple tank, triple tank would be good against the flankers.

3808
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:16,400
Also, also, another thing, this team, okay, Guru does a thing where he will TP at the start of the round every single time without fail.

3809
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:19,120
He will TP and he will try to kidnap us.

3810
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:27,400
So what that means is while you're walking, I'll tell us to just like, wait a sec and just like chill so that you don't walk in a straight line and he kidnaps you with TP.

3811
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:31,620
Cause he will, he will TP every time.

3812
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,000
Yeah.

3813
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,800
So you just have to like watch your pathing.

3814
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:36,400
Cause if he kidnaps you, like you're just dead.

3815
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:37,520
You're literally in front of six people.

3816
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:40,200
Okay.

3817
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:42,280
So they, they do that every time.

3818
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:45,040
So they're, they're going to jump out of the portal and fight us as well.

3819
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:48,640
Most likely, unless we got to pick on them, they'll, they'll retreat and then we'll get point for free.

3820
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:49,020
Essentially.

3821
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,740
It's a, it's a high risk, high reward play that he does.

3822
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:53,180
Does he, does he do that a lot actually?

3823
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:53,240
What?

3824
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:54,540
He does that break too.

3825
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:55,780
Oh really?

3826
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:58,220
Every single game he will do it.

3827
02:07:59,140 --> 02:07:59,620
Wait, so sorry.

3828
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:00,560
How do you come to that?

3829
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:03,540
We just don't walk, just be aware where you're walking.

3830
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:11,080
I think, I think midway to point, we like chill for a sec and then we just path after waiting maybe like, I don't know, max like 10 seconds.

3831
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:12,600
Just tell us when to stop.

3832
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:13,760
Yeah.

3833
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:17,660
You just have to be really like sporadic with your movement.

3834
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:19,220
Just don't run like straight lines basically.

3835
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:20,260
Okay.

3836
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:20,460
Okay.

3837
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:25,840
Interesting.

3838
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:27,780
I didn't even know he did that.

3839
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:29,540
Yeah.

3840
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:29,860
Yeah.

3841
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:31,960
You don't play at the ultra D gen hours.

3842
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:34,020
Yeah, exactly.

3843
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:40,900
So the way this goes, we ban torch, protect rocket, ban Spider-Man, protect Adam.

3844
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:43,120
And then we ban Emma Frost last.

3845
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:45,380
Cause we don't want Gary to play Emma Frost.

3846
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:49,500
But it's possible that they'll protect Emma, which is fine.

3847
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:55,260
But we could also ban Iron Fist instead of Spider-Man.

3848
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:58,320
If you guys think, uh, that's more worthy.

3849
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,020
Cause I think Necros does play that too.

3850
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:01,700
Iron Fist.

3851
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:02,560
Oh, bro.

3852
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:04,660
That's like really annoying.

3853
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:05,420
Yeah.

3854
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:05,740
Yeah.

3855
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:06,300
That's...

3856
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:07,640
I mean, I feel like...

3857
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,420
Would Neymar...

3858
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:10,420
Shit.

3859
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:11,700
Okay.

3860
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,780
You guys good to go?

3861
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:15,200
We're gonna start up the game here.

3862
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:15,680
You good?

3863
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:16,020
Yeah.

3864
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:16,220
Yeah, we're good.

3865
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,580
Yeah, we're ready.

3866
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:18,580
Good luck.

3867
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:18,920
Have fun.

3868
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:21,740
Why do you say that's so aggressive?

3869
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:23,740
Like, like, like, another thing to know is that...

3870
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:25,940
Another thing to know, we're on NA servers.

3871
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:28,800
So, like, Spider-Man's really hard to play on ping.

3872
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:31,700
So, I think, honestly, we just ban Iron Fist instead.

3873
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:33,000
You think Iron...

3874
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:33,920
I mean...

3875
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:38,180
Shit.

3876
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:39,720
But then...

3877
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:41,000
But then the thing with Spider-Man is the Venom team up.

3878
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,540
He will 1v6 on Iron Fist.

3879
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:43,820
I agree.

3880
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:46,740
Venom team up with...

3881
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:48,660
I mean, honestly, if we let...

3882
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:52,060
Okay, if you wanna be on Iron Fist and we let Spider-Man through, maybe I play Thing instead of Mag.

3883
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:53,900
Yeah.

3884
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:54,980
We could do that.

3885
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:59,720
Wait, aren't there weaker players on support, though?

3886
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:00,840
So, like...

3887
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,560
Oh, Aspen's on the enemy team.

3888
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:04,480
I'm gonna disrupt their backline.

3889
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:05,880
Yeah, do that.

3890
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:06,700
That's really good.

3891
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:12,260
Do they ban?

3892
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:13,480
Okay.

3893
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:14,580
Actually, I'm...

3894
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:15,580
Oh, they were researching.

3895
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:17,500
That's fine.

3896
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:18,460
Protect our Rocket.

3897
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:19,060
Yep.

3898
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:20,680
Oh!

3899
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,200
Protected Iron Fist.

3900
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:23,580
I knew it, bro.

3901
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:25,580
Alright, protect Rocket.

3902
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:26,320
Yeah.

3903
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:32,960
We could ban Luna so he doesn't have the orb or the snowflake.

3904
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:34,180
And you wanna ban Spider-Man or what?

3905
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:36,740
Um...

3906
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:39,380
Well, if they protect Iron Fist, are they gonna bother going Spider-Man?

3907
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:40,800
Oh, for sure.

3908
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:41,080
Yeah.

3909
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:41,920
No, I'm banning Spider-Man.

3910
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:42,700
Okay.

3911
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:43,280
Yeah.

3912
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:47,220
But, I'm just thinking, we could ban Luna so they don't go...

3913
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,940
They don't give him a snowflake.

3914
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:52,520
Mm-hmm.

3915
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:53,020
Yeah.

3916
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:55,940
If they protect Luna, they're gonna try and...

3917
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:57,640
...pocket him as hard as they can.

3918
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:01,020
Unless they protect Luna.

3919
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:04,800
Because at least, he's still...

3920
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:05,700
He's more killable.

3921
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:07,220
Yeah, I know.

3922
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:09,620
He's slightly more killable without the pocket.

3923
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:11,140
Okay.

3924
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:11,500
Okay.

3925
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:12,220
I don't...

3926
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:14,380
I don't wanna make it obvious with the Hulk protect me.

3927
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:15,540
The Hulk protect something else.

3928
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:18,260
I'm thinking...

3929
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:21,500
Honestly, I think we need to play Emma Frost into Iron Fist.

3930
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:22,400
And you need to grab him.

3931
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:23,460
Yeah, I can do that.

3932
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:23,660
Sure.

3933
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:24,060
I can do that.

3934
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:24,440
Okay.

3935
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,520
I can just protect Emma.

3936
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:26,740
I'll just play...

3937
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:28,180
I'll play, like, middle back line.

3938
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:29,040
Alright.

3939
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:34,820
Which means, Tyler, you may need to play a little bit...

3940
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:36,140
...front line a bit.

3941
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:37,060
Not too much.

3942
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:38,780
Honestly, I would say just keep doing what you're doing.

3943
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:41,260
But if I say, like, I'll back, then you just, like, back too.

3944
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:41,900
You know what I mean?

3945
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:42,200
Okay.

3946
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:43,360
It's like a push and pull.

3947
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,160
Ban Luna.

3948
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:46,900
Luna doesn't have a pocket.

3949
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:47,800
Yeah.

3950
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:48,400
Part.

3951
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:50,180
True.

3952
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:56,550
And then, we could go...

3953
02:11:57,550 --> 02:11:58,890
...Loki, Rocket, Sue.

3954
02:11:59,190 --> 02:12:02,010
And that's, like, our best bet in protecting our back line.

3955
02:12:04,150 --> 02:12:04,590
Okay.

3956
02:12:05,070 --> 02:12:05,830
Hear me out.

3957
02:12:05,970 --> 02:12:09,150
And maybe this is crazy, but I think...

3958
02:12:09,150 --> 02:12:11,710
...Cap, Bucky would go insane here, actually.

3959
02:12:12,070 --> 02:12:12,370
Yeah.

3960
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:15,010
I don't think you're wrong.

3961
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:16,490
I think we run that.

3962
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:17,370
And we hit the team up.

3963
02:12:17,370 --> 02:12:18,650
So, you don't want Emma, then?

3964
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:19,350
I think you're a hero.

3965
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:21,330
I'm not judging.

3966
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:22,030
Fuck, that's right.

3967
02:12:22,030 --> 02:12:22,390
Ugh.

3968
02:12:24,430 --> 02:12:25,630
Maybe we play one round with...

3969
02:12:25,630 --> 02:12:26,190
...without Emma.

3970
02:12:26,510 --> 02:12:27,590
And just do the cap shit.

3971
02:12:27,790 --> 02:12:28,770
And you'd just be annoying as fuck.

3972
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:29,970
Our back line...

3973
02:12:29,970 --> 02:12:30,590
But I feel like...

3974
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:32,390
I think the problem with that is, though, I think...

3975
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:33,870
I don't think our back line is going to survive long enough.

3976
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:34,390
I can...

3977
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:34,470
I can peel...

3978
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:35,590
I can peel back line as Bucky would team up.

3979
02:12:35,690 --> 02:12:36,210
That's the thing.

3980
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:37,510
If I team up on...

3981
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:38,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3982
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:40,130
Okay, so you want me to go cap instead?

3983
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:40,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3984
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:41,250
Go cap.

3985
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:41,570
Go cap.

3986
02:12:41,710 --> 02:12:43,070
Go cap on their back line.

3987
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:46,070
Because I think their support is...

3988
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:47,030
Aspen and...

3989
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:48,150
What's the plan?

3990
02:12:48,330 --> 02:12:48,910
Anita, right?

3991
02:12:48,910 --> 02:12:50,290
Me and you are diving back line together.

3992
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:51,290
That's the new plan.

3993
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:53,330
I'm on cap.

3994
02:12:54,030 --> 02:12:54,590
I'm on cap.

3995
02:12:54,670 --> 02:12:56,050
I'm on cap your own Venom and we're just going back line.

3996
02:12:56,750 --> 02:12:57,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3997
02:12:57,910 --> 02:12:58,270
I'm stupid.

3998
02:12:58,410 --> 02:12:59,010
I'm stupid as fuck.

3999
02:12:59,250 --> 02:13:00,130
Hulk Damor, what the fuck?

4000
02:13:01,290 --> 02:13:01,930
I'm so stupid.

4001
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:02,350
Oh, yeah.

4002
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:03,910
They gave us a shit.

4003
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:05,470
Oh, I could play...

4004
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:06,590
Wait, so I Hulk them?

4005
02:13:06,730 --> 02:13:07,090
You want that?

4006
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:08,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4007
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:09,310
Okay, I lied again, Tyler.

4008
02:13:09,490 --> 02:13:11,150
Okay, um...

4009
02:13:11,590 --> 02:13:11,870
Lydia...

4010
02:13:11,870 --> 02:13:12,470
Um...

4011
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:13,250
It's Richard.

4012
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:15,530
When they dive us, uh...

4013
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:18,010
Bliss is going to give us a shield and we just play around that shield.

4014
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:19,690
Okay, okay.

4015
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:20,910
So, like, just play near...

4016
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:22,650
Play near, uh, Bliss.

4017
02:13:22,830 --> 02:13:23,290
Just play near us.

4018
02:13:23,290 --> 02:13:24,090
Just, like, near us.

4019
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:24,550
Yep.

4020
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:25,410
Okay.

4021
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:26,710
Tyler, just...

4022
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:27,610
Do what you were doing before.

4023
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:29,770
Like, you'll die back line and just get out with your life.

4024
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:30,110
That's all.

4025
02:13:30,270 --> 02:13:30,550
Okay.

4026
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:31,870
Guys, guys, guys.

4027
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:32,650
Care TP.

4028
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:33,290
Seriously.

4029
02:13:34,610 --> 02:13:35,950
Split up, split up, split up, split up.

4030
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:36,590
Don't walk with me.

4031
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:37,370
Don't walk in a straight line.

4032
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:39,010
I'll walk with Tyler.

4033
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:43,150
They might try to just, like, individually try and get one of us.

4034
02:13:43,250 --> 02:13:45,030
I don't see anything.

4035
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:46,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4036
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:47,910
He's looking.

4037
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:50,850
Oh, there it is.

4038
02:13:51,670 --> 02:13:52,370
In our main.

4039
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:52,850
In our main.

4040
02:13:54,810 --> 02:13:55,990
I'm a little...

4041
02:13:57,070 --> 02:13:58,230
I'm okay, I'm okay.

4042
02:13:58,290 --> 02:13:58,950
I'm okay, but...

4043
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:00,970
I'm getting chased by a necros right now.

4044
02:14:01,310 --> 02:14:01,950
Mantis, Mantis, Mantis.

4045
02:14:02,030 --> 02:14:02,210
That's fine.

4046
02:14:02,870 --> 02:14:03,770
They singled me down.

4047
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:04,790
I'm just going to go point.

4048
02:14:04,890 --> 02:14:05,610
Yeah, we fine.

4049
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:06,370
We win this.

4050
02:14:08,090 --> 02:14:09,210
I've squid, we have squids.

4051
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:11,710
Brood and Iron Spartan one.

4052
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:12,550
We have squids over here.

4053
02:14:12,770 --> 02:14:13,550
Iron Spartan 1.

4054
02:14:13,670 --> 02:14:13,790
Iron Spartan 1.

4055
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:14,210
Iron Spartan 1.

4056
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:14,590
I'm campaign台灣.

4057
02:14:15,490 --> 02:14:15,770
Iron Spartan 1.

4058
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:15,890
Iron Spartan 1.

4059
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:16,230
I'm back.

4060
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:16,690
Nice.

4061
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:21,110
So Iñiko's just targeted me so it's fine.

4062
02:14:21,550 --> 02:14:22,070
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

4063
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:24,490
OK, you guys just need to play around my squids the entire time.

4064
02:14:24,630 --> 02:14:25,430
I'll just try to watch over you.

4065
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:29,530
Because Iron Spist will come for backline every single time.

4066
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:33,110
Tyler, you could probably set up like right...

4067
02:14:33,110 --> 02:14:34,610
Yeah, on the tree or on the wall here, is good.

4068
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:35,390
Either or...

4069
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:37,850
Let me just wait for them.

4070
02:14:37,990 --> 02:14:38,950
They're going to top left right now.

4071
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:42,930
They went Emma, so I'm gonna drop.

4072
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:44,470
Oh, can you go high ground, Tyler?

4073
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:44,790
Can you go?

4074
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:49,870
I'm on rocket and the whole back on here.

4075
02:14:50,130 --> 02:14:51,250
No lamps, no lamps.

4076
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:52,410
I had to use lamps.

4077
02:14:53,090 --> 02:14:54,090
I almost have my ult, it's fine.

4078
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:55,650
I'm with you, Tyler.

4079
02:14:58,030 --> 02:14:58,670
I'm gonna rock it.

4080
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:00,110
I'm gonna ult this.

4081
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:01,850
Yo, the ironford's low.

4082
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:03,850
Oh, I'm anthus now?

4083

I have Groot on me.

4084
02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:07,370
Oh, he's low!

4085
02:15:07,570 --> 02:15:08,030
Necro's note!

4086
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:08,850
I got him, got him, got him.

4087
02:15:10,010 --> 02:15:10,290
Nice.

4088
02:15:10,610 --> 02:15:10,950
I got grabbed.

4089
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:12,110
I'm on the main, can I help?

4090
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:13,230
Can we just kill Groot?

4091
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:13,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4092
02:15:13,850 --> 02:15:15,650
I have... I'm healing, I'm healing, guys.

4093
02:15:16,750 --> 02:15:17,890
We got back a little bit, careful.

4094
02:15:18,650 --> 02:15:18,870
Will.

4095
02:15:19,250 --> 02:15:19,550
Huge Will.

4096
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:19,790
Nice.

4097
02:15:20,450 --> 02:15:20,730
Groot.

4098
02:15:21,150 --> 02:15:21,930
Groot one, Groot one, Groot!

4099
02:15:23,210 --> 02:15:24,590
We fight this, we hard fight this.

4100
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:25,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4101
02:15:25,570 --> 02:15:26,870
Actually, maybe Tyler back, Tyler.

4102
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:27,910
Okay, back, back, back, back.

4103
02:15:28,010 --> 02:15:28,370
Yeah, we can't kill.

4104
02:15:28,390 --> 02:15:28,830
We can't finish.

4105
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,390
It's fine.

4106
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:31,070
They're gonna have Groot ult.

4107
02:15:31,130 --> 02:15:31,650
They're gonna have Groot ult soon.

4108
02:15:31,730 --> 02:15:32,050
Can we split?

4109
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:32,390
Yep.

4110
02:15:32,570 --> 02:15:34,210
Yeah, I have Lamps for it, too, and we need it.

4111
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:34,990
I'm on Groot.

4112
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:35,590
He's walking in by himself.

4113
02:15:35,710 --> 02:15:35,830
He's one.

4114
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:36,170
Or half.

4115
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:38,950
Uh, we use Invis ult first.

4116
02:15:39,650 --> 02:15:40,570
I'm gonna... Back out, Tyler?

4117
02:15:40,670 --> 02:15:40,950
Back out, Tyler.

4118
02:15:41,010 --> 02:15:41,610

4119
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:42,170
Invis ult first.

4120
02:15:42,330 --> 02:15:42,490
Oh, I'm blocked.

4121
02:15:42,910 --> 02:15:44,050
I got... I got... I have to use Lamps.

4122
02:15:44,110 --> 02:15:44,850
I have to use Lamps for you.

4123
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:46,630
We have no Lamps.

4124
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:47,210
We have no Lamps.

4125
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:47,810
We have no Lamps.

4126
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:48,050
We have no Lamps.

4127
02:15:48,050 --> 02:15:48,250
We have no Lamps.

4128
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:48,530
We have no Lamps.

4129
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:48,650
We have no Lamps.

4130
02:15:48,670 --> 02:15:48,670
We have no Lamps.

4131
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:49,490
We have no Lamps.

4132
02:15:49,650 --> 02:15:50,390
We have no Lamps.

4133
02:15:50,610 --> 02:15:50,790
I'm res.

4134
02:15:50,830 --> 02:15:50,830
I'm res.

4135
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:52,790
I'm res.

4136
02:15:54,130 --> 02:15:55,570
Tyler, can you go rock it, rock it.

4137
02:15:56,730 --> 02:15:58,110
Where are you?

4138
02:15:58,430 --> 02:15:58,430
Okay.

4139
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:02,850
Stay on the altar!

4140
02:16:02,850 --> 02:16:03,270
I thought I was gonna be ult.

4141
02:16:07,730 --> 02:16:08,750
Can we rocket ult?

4142
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:11,190
Yeah, rocket ult, rocket ult.

4143
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:14,250
She's not here, she's not here, she's not here, she's not here.

4144
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:20,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4145
02:16:21,290 --> 02:16:22,590
That's fine, we have ult for that.

4146
02:16:23,590 --> 02:16:24,950
And then we have Will and Rocket.

4147
02:16:25,730 --> 02:16:26,910
Yeah, I'll try to combo.

4148
02:16:27,290 --> 02:16:29,990
I'm gonna swap up Loki because he's on Bucky now.

4149
02:16:30,770 --> 02:16:32,290
I'll just go Mantis and Pocket.

4150
02:16:32,850 --> 02:16:34,950
I'm my eternal guide and the source of my power.

4151
02:16:34,950 --> 02:16:36,750
I'm gonna stay this for now.

4152
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:38,590
Yeah, I have ult, you have ult.

4153
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:43,010
Okay, watch for... hold up.

4154
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:48,550
Wait, Groot's frozen here, can we kill him?

4155
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:51,490
Yeah, I gave you extra double damage.

4156
02:16:54,410 --> 02:16:56,410
We're all up, we can help us a wall.

4157
02:16:56,830 --> 02:16:57,810
Break wall, break wall, break wall.

4158
02:16:58,290 --> 02:17:00,910
Yeah, I'm giving you double damage, I gave you double damage.

4159
02:17:00,910 --> 02:17:01,510
Aw.

4160
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:04,730
I got hit with that.

4161
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:05,650
Ohhhh.

4162
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:08,990
You're a down one.

4163
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:10,790
Groot, Groot, Groot, Groot, Groot.

4164
02:17:13,550 --> 02:17:14,530
I got Bucky.

4165
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:16,010
I'm just showing for a sec.

4166
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:17,150
I'm Groot.

4167
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:20,690
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

4168
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:21,510
Should we wait to regroup?

4169
02:17:21,510 --> 02:17:23,050
I think we should get a group, yeah.

4170
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:26,010
Should I change for you?

4171
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:28,350
They're not diving anymore.

4172
02:17:28,770 --> 02:17:29,370
They're not diving anymore.

4173
02:17:29,370 --> 02:17:29,410
They're not diving.

4174
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:32,090
Go, go, go Cap.

4175
02:17:32,250 --> 02:17:32,670
I'm gonna go Bucky.

4176
02:17:33,870 --> 02:17:34,690
Wait, they're letting me live.

4177
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:35,490
Aw, they're just stag.

4178
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:35,730
Okay.

4179
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:36,950
Changing cap, go Cap.

4180
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:43,750
Yeah, okay, um...

4181
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:44,190
Tyler, same thing.

4182
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:45,550
I'm gonna call die one back on here, okay?

4183
02:17:48,030 --> 02:17:49,310
I'm leaving you double damage, Gil.

4184
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:50,750
Uh, yeah.

4185
02:17:53,110 --> 02:17:53,590
I'm double.

4186
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:54,670
Ready?

4187
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:55,750
Wait, wait, wait.

4188
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:56,130
Double damage?

4189
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:58,190
Okay, yeah, I'm ready, Tyler.

4190
02:17:58,310 --> 02:17:58,410
You ready?

4191
02:17:58,910 --> 02:17:59,150
Yep.

4192
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:01,510
I'm going rocket three, two, one.

4193
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:02,110
He's so low.

4194
02:18:05,150 --> 02:18:06,190
Looking for hooks, looking for hooks.

4195
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:07,390
Oh, they really talking, man.

4196
02:18:07,470 --> 02:18:08,090
He care really bad.

4197
02:18:08,630 --> 02:18:09,270
I'm trying to kill you.

4198
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:10,510
Tyler, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

4199
02:18:13,710 --> 02:18:14,330
He's won, he's won.

4200
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:14,910
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4201
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:16,590
I have ult soon.

4202
02:18:16,730 --> 02:18:18,830
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

4203
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:20,570
This is ult, I've got you.

4204
02:18:20,570 --> 02:18:20,830
I can burn that.

4205
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:21,190
I've got you.

4206
02:18:21,790 --> 02:18:22,050
Multi?

4207
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:24,030
We are undefeatable!

4208
02:18:24,350 --> 02:18:25,130
Nice, I got you.

4209
02:18:25,470 --> 02:18:26,510
Okay, go, manthus, Tyler, manthus, manthus.

4210
02:18:27,430 --> 02:18:28,010
We're back on.

4211
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:33,320
Manthus dead.

4212
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:34,480
Bucky, Bucky, dead.

4213
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,140
Bucky dead.

4214
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:36,340
Bucky dead.

4215
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:36,940
I might die here.

4216
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:37,580
I am healed.

4217
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:38,240
Fine.

4218
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:39,600
Emma, one, I want, Emma, one, I'm on it.

4219
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:40,400
Oh, I have ult soon.

4220
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:40,880
Just carry me.

4221
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:42,380
Oh, grid is low.

4222
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:43,440
Grid is low sleeping.

4223
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:44,360
Time to go for supports.

4224
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:44,880
Yep.

4225
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:46,320
I almost have my ult.

4226
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:49,480
I can't do anything about our supports there.

4227
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:50,720
Aw, should I ult this or save?

4228
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:51,860
Probably save.

4229
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:53,160
Probably save.

4230
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:53,680
Probably save, yeah.

4231
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,860
Oh, no.

4232
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:01,040
Shit.

4233
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:02,320
Yeah, yeah.

4234
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:03,060
It's fine.

4235
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:04,700
This is fucking game!

4236
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:07,380
How does everybody always heal before like me?

4237
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:09,100
That's triple support.

4238
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:09,800
I don't fucking understand.

4239
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:10,760
That's triple support.

4240
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:14,840
They're back on Iron Fist, by the way.

4241
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:15,860
But I think it's okay.

4242
02:19:15,860 --> 02:19:16,020
Okay.

4243
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:17,560
If they're back on Iron Fist, I'll swap back to Loki.

4244
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:19,480
I can change Hulk after first fight, honestly.

4245
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:20,580
I might just do that.

4246
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:21,460
You think?

4247
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:23,100
Play the counter swap game.

4248
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:23,620
Fuck it.

4249
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:24,140
Yeah.

4250
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:25,360
I'll go back to Loki.

4251
02:19:25,880 --> 02:19:27,720
What society can exist without...

4252
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:28,840
Are you gonna do the portals thing again?

4253
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:30,620
Yeah, they're gonna do it.

4254
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:34,760
Um, yeah, we just really have to really get those supports.

4255
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:38,360
Um, do you think I should go Mantis or Cloak for when he goes back to Loki?

4256
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:40,540
I think I'm gonna target the Mantis every dive.

4257
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:41,620
I think the Mantis is a free kill.

4258
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:42,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4259
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,300
Okay, so who...

4260
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:44,360
Oh, we have to save the world.

4261
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:45,260
I think the Mantis.

4262
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:46,360
Are the support names?

4263
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:48,280
Sweet Anita or...

4264
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:51,460
Oh yeah, it's Aspen, Sweet Anita, and who's that one?

4265
02:19:51,980 --> 02:19:52,300
Pika!

4266
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:52,720
Okay.

4267
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:53,120
Yeah, yeah.

4268
02:19:53,320 --> 02:19:53,380
Pika Boo!

4269
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:53,740
Okay, okay.

4270
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:56,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4271
02:19:58,900 --> 02:19:59,640
Alright, we got this.

4272
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:00,160
We got this.

4273
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,700
That was a really close round.

4274
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:03,540
Alright, yeah, that was close.

4275
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:04,960
We made him swap up iron.

4276
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:05,860
Yeah.

4277
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:07,780
All you need to do is capture the missionary.

4278
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:09,040
It's just a triple support.

4279
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:12,000
Whoever has triple supports last wins.

4280
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:13,260
Just carry TP, by the way.

4281
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:13,960
He's looking.

4282
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:14,220
Yup.

4283
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:15,800
He's definitely looking.

4284
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:17,540
No, they're walking, you know?

4285
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:18,440
Yeah, they're walking up.

4286
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:19,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4287
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:21,020
There's maybe saving portal.

4288
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:22,080
Well, I only see three of them, actually.

4289
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:22,560
I'm not sure.

4290
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:22,940
Four?

4291
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:23,900
Yeah, yeah, they're walking, they're walking.

4292
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:24,320
He's off.

4293
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,940
Okay, I'm gonna go back line here in a sec, Tyler.

4294
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:26,180
You ready?

4295
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:26,760
Yup.

4296
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:27,780
We go, Mantis.

4297
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:28,180
Ready?

4298
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:29,400
Three, two, one.

4299
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:29,980
I'm on Mantis.

4300
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:32,460
Hooker, hooker, hooker, hooker, hooker, hooker.

4301
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:36,020
I have to use Lamp.

4302
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:36,760
I have to use Lamp.

4303
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:37,600
I got Groot.

4304
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:38,640
I got Groot.

4305
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:39,960
I'm going Mantis still.

4306
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:41,200
I'm on Aspen, Mantis.

4307
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:43,000
Groot is res.

4308
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:43,520
You've got res.

4309
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:43,980
Alright, team up activated.

4310
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:46,000
There is a wall, so be careful.

4311
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:47,500
Nice.

4312
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:48,160
I got a wall, sorry.

4313
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:48,800
I should be res, I should be res.

4314
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:49,740
Oh, nice.

4315
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:52,840
I'm getting walled off, supports our walled off.

4316
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4317
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:54,440
Supports our walled off.

4318
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:54,460
Supports our walled off.

4319
02:20:58,840 --> 02:20:59,200
Um...

4320
02:20:59,200 --> 02:20:59,920
Wait, what happened with it?

4321
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:03,460
Uh, me and the rocket got walled off, and we couldn't break the wall.

4322
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:07,080
And then the, uh, and then...

4323
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:09,760
And then Iron Fist just went behind us.

4324
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:11,560
All good.

4325
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:13,680
We captured the mission area!

4326
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:14,960
Yo, I messed up.

4327
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:15,260
I swing.

4328
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:19,600
I'm a ruin.

4329
02:21:20,060 --> 02:21:22,000
You can do that, honestly.

4330
02:21:22,180 --> 02:21:22,920
I wouldn't mind if you did.

4331
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:23,660
You could do that, honestly.

4332
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:24,440
Maybe I do Wolverine.

4333
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4334
02:21:25,140 --> 02:21:25,680
Go for it, go for it.

4335
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:26,680
I'm gon' try it.

4336
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:27,080
You could just run.

4337
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:27,780
Yeah, triple D.

4338
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:28,480
Go for it, go for it.

4339
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:28,820
Double D.

4340
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:33,730
Wait on you.

4341
02:21:33,930 --> 02:21:34,130
All right.

4342
02:21:34,270 --> 02:21:35,030
Let's see what they do here.

4343
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:38,830
They're gonna play probably really far back.

4344
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:41,490
All right, Tyler, I'm gonna need you to go first to make space, yeah?

4345
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:42,350
Nope, go!

4346
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:43,230
Yeah, nice.

4347
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:45,030
I'm walking in, Tyler, help Tyler.

4348
02:21:45,030 --> 02:21:45,850

4350
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:47,070
I'll ult first.

4351
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:49,610
I pinned Groot grud grud grud grud grud.

4352
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:49,890
Zero.

4353
02:21:50,590 --> 02:21:51,770
Who's doing this to...

4354
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:53,250
If you want me to ult.

4355
02:21:53,410 --> 02:21:54,310
Let me order if you want me to ult.

4356
02:21:54,390 --> 02:21:56,230
We don't need it.

4357
02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:57,630
Come on Groot again, Groot died right?

4358
02:21:59,030 --> 02:22:00,070
I'm gonna do some ult here.

4359
02:22:00,210 --> 02:22:01,270
Ult here .

I can lobster little rocket ult...

4362
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:08,070
Can we kill the rocket first?

4363
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:12,230
There's a Groot on our rocket.

4364
02:22:12,410 --> 02:22:13,190
Groot is on our rocket.

4365
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:14,730
Can I get a heal?

4366
02:22:15,310 --> 02:22:16,110
I'm trying to heal.

4367
02:22:17,330 --> 02:22:17,970
I can't.

4368
02:22:20,410 --> 02:22:21,130
I'm gonna go close.

4369
02:22:21,990 --> 02:22:23,410
Their sports were so low.

4370
02:22:23,650 --> 02:22:24,130
Yeah, I know.

4371
02:22:24,270 --> 02:22:25,190
I have ult here, but...

4372
02:22:27,410 --> 02:22:28,450
Are we gonna go for something?

4373
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:31,470
Oh, nice, you're good, okay.

4374
02:22:35,430 --> 02:22:38,690
Okay, I'm gonna try and get a backline ult here, if I can.

4375
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:41,410
Wait, grub, grub, grub, I stole grub, I stole grub people!

4376
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:43,030
He's one, he's one!

4377
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:43,410
Nice!

4378
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:48,430
Help, Tyler, help, Tyler, help, Tyler!

4379
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:50,030
I'm trying to get, I'm trying to.

4380
02:22:50,590 --> 02:22:52,190
Yeah, I couldn't get the tank.

4381
02:22:52,850 --> 02:22:53,870
We are undefiable!

4382
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:57,650
They just have every ult all the time.

4383
02:22:58,250 --> 02:22:59,310
Oh, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

4384
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:03,530
I have to staff.

4385
02:23:04,090 --> 02:23:05,870
We have to touch, but we don't have a tank.

4386
02:23:06,350 --> 02:23:07,650
Oh, no!

4387
02:23:09,550 --> 02:23:10,390
I have many things.

4388
02:23:10,390 --> 02:23:11,670
I got Groot again, but I'm walled.

4389
02:23:11,710 --> 02:23:13,190
What do I do when I'm walled?

4390
02:23:13,430 --> 02:23:14,370
You climb up the wall.

4391
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:18,510
Yeah, yeah, I can, I can.

4392
02:23:18,910 --> 02:23:19,970
I might die here also.

4393
02:23:20,770 --> 02:23:22,650
Yeah, I don't have...

4394
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:28,280
Oh...

4395
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:29,200
Manthus one of you.

4396
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:29,860
I got it.

4397
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:30,160
No!

4398
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:32,880
Let's go back in.

4399
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:35,580
Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

4400
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:36,600
They got...

4401
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:38,100
I'm TPing, I go, I'm TPing.

4402
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:38,500
Okay.

4403
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,100
Reload, Reload, Reload!

4404
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:42,500
I TP, I TP!

4405
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:45,140
Reload, Reload, Reload, Reload!

4406
02:23:45,880 --> 02:23:48,660
There is a lamp here.

4407
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:49,140
There's a lamp.

4408
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:49,620
There's a lamp.

4409
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:50,560
Mantis, Mantis!

4410
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:51,240
Mantis 1!

4411
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:52,320
Got Mantis, got Mantis!

4412
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:54,020
I reload.

4413
02:23:54,380 --> 02:23:54,780
I reload.

4414
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:56,240
M1, M1, M1, M1.

4415
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:57,440
I'm here for snap.

4416
02:23:58,900 --> 02:23:59,340
Stand point.

4417
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,140
Okay, um...

4418
02:24:02,140 --> 02:24:02,440
Right here.

4419
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:05,080
I could maybe get an ult, but...

4420
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:06,440
I have many chances.

4421
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:07,920
I don't know.

4422
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:08,340
It's gonna be tough.

4423
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:09,100
Wait, Rocket's here.

4424
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:09,600
What the fuck?

4425
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:10,020
That's huge.

4426
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:12,780
Nice.

4427
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:14,440
Okay, now what?

4428
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:17,320
Oh, we have Rocket ult soon?

4429
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:20,140
I think maybe we initiate with Rocket ult at the choke, maybe?

4430
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:20,920
Yeah, 99%.

4431
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:21,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4432
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:22,240
Okay, I have an ult.

4433
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:22,980
I think that's the plan.

4434
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:23,540
I think that's the plan.

4435
02:24:24,140 --> 02:24:26,240
Wherever they go, we should try and Rocket ult aggressively, maybe.

4436
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:27,880
Can we blow someone up?

4437
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:29,020
Yes.

4438
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:29,760
Yes.

4439
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:31,540
Yeah, they TPed left side.

4440
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:33,200
So they're gonna be low ground here?

4441
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4442
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:35,400
That's bad.

4443
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:37,160
That's bad, that's bad, that's bad.

4444
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:39,320
Stay behind me, stay behind me.

4445
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:40,740
Just get ready.

4446
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:41,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4447
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:42,940
Rocket ult, Rocket ult, Rocket ult.

4448
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:44,700
But we're supporting.

4449
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:45,500
Oh, that's lucky.

4450
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:47,180
I put Lamp Down.

4451
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:48,560
We are undefeatable!

4452
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:49,800
Bigov, bigov!

4453
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:52,000
Master of all, master of all.

4454
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:52,860
Everybody, all support's dead.

4455
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:53,920
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

4456
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:55,540
Oh my god, you fucker.

4457
02:24:56,180 --> 02:24:56,820
Stupid Groot.

4458
02:24:57,180 --> 02:24:58,420
He walled me off.

4459
02:24:59,220 --> 02:24:59,880
Kill this Iron Fist.

4460
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:02,840
I'm dead, I'm dead.

4461
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:06,620
The crew walled me off and Nekros trapped me in the corner.

4462
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:09,200
No, they went so...

4463
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,180
Okay, they're gonna target me.

4464
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:10,980
They're gonna hard target me.

4465
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:14,480
Okay, I have... Do you want Rocket ult or invis?

4466
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:14,860
Yeah.

4467
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:16,140
I think Rocket ult, right?

4468
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:17,740
Yeah, I think you copy Rocket ult.

4469
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:18,320
Okay, okay.

4470
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:19,540
And try and pull a Wolverine, maybe?

4471
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:20,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4472
02:25:21,140 --> 02:25:21,760
Over there, over there.

4473
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:23,800
Liddy, you have to play near me.

4474
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:25,680
Okay, Tyler, be careful of Wolverine grab, yeah?

4475
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:29,820
Yeah, I got it, I got it, I helped it, I helped it.

4476
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:30,600
Can we pull up their Rocket ult?

4477
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:31,900
Can we do that?

4478
02:25:31,900 --> 02:25:32,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4479
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,340
Mine's blown up, mine's blown up, mine's blown up.

4480
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:35,740
Okay, it's fine.

4481
02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:36,980
I'm gonna get pinned, I need care, I need care.

4482
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:39,820
We shoot Wolverine, we have to shoot him.

4483
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:40,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard.

4484
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:42,100
I'm gonna die.

4485
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,080
Fuck, babe, quote, quote, quote.

4486
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:47,120
You have a res, you have a res, you have a res, you have a res, you have a res, you have a res.

4487
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I have, I have a headline, I have a headline.

4488
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:51,840
We have to kill him.

4489
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:52,800
If he doesn't die, we lose the game.

4490
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:55,560
I'm trying my best, I'm trying my best.

4491
02:25:56,380 --> 02:25:56,600
I'm trying my best.

4492
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:57,340
I'm wanting to peeking him at the top.

4493
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,080
I quit and I quit and I quit.

4494
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:00,220
He's low, he's low, he's low, he's low.

4495
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:01,620
Really though, really though.

4496
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:06,140
I'm trying my best to keep you all alive.

4497
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:09,680
I go cap and stall.

4498
02:26:10,380 --> 02:26:11,500
I do a vault.

4499
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:12,520
Yeah.

4500
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:16,520
I get the skill.

4501
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,040
Are you TP'd?

4502
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:22,760
I'm pinned.

4503
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:24,240
Aww.

4504
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:25,520
Oh, that's unlucky.

4505
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:26,620
Nice try.

4506
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:29,000
Oh, is everybody like an AOE healer?

4507
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,060
Like, there's no way they're targeting their heals here.

4508
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,860
No, yeah, there's a lot.

4509
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:35,280
I mean, Rock is A, we heal.

4510
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:36,320
Focus A, we heal.

4511
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:36,920
Yeah.

4512
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:38,340
Shit is trash.

4513
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:44,680
Honestly, both rounds, 99 to 99, I think there's a few things we could have done differently.

4514
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:45,600
Yeah.

4515
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:48,180
Yeah, I played that game about as perfect as I could.

4516
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:49,140
Don't watch them on, though.

4517
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:52,800
Shit.

4518
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:54,540
I don't know, what are we doing?

4519
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:58,420
I mean, maybe we should just stay... We have to ban group there.

4520
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:00,140
group ban?

4521
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:00,740
Yeah.

4522
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:04,060
Their group was very oppressive on our support, so... Yeah.

4523
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:04,860
That's fair.

4524
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:08,260
Because they were blocking off heals really well.

4525
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:11,020
And I had to, like, always maneuver everywhere.

4526
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:15,640
But the thing is, Necros was flanking everywhere, so wherever we go, Necros will follow us.

4527
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:17,460
It was a try.

4528
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:18,780
Yeah.

4529
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:19,640
It was really close.

4530
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,820
I really think we can beat that team, though.

4531
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:24,680
Yeah, I think so, too.

4532
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:27,320
We just need a better ban line against them.

4533
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:27,540
Yeah.

4534
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:28,280
Yeah.

4535
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:29,260
A hundred percent.

4536
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:29,840
Yeah.

4537
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:35,460
Necros on Iron Fist was not that, like... It didn't do that much on us.

4538
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:44,700
I don't know, maybe... Or if we want to get real weird, we could try Tyler on Hulk and then me on Emma against that.

4539
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:45,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4540
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:47,080
I think for sure, actually.

4541
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:49,200
That might be a play.

4542
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:50,080
Yeah.

4543
02:27:50,700 --> 02:27:51,180
For sure.

4544
02:27:53,860 --> 02:27:55,440
If Tyler's comfortable on Hulk.

4545
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:57,520
Yep.

4546
02:27:58,420 --> 02:27:58,720
Yeah.

4547
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,980
Well, apparently our team was the closest to beating Necros.

4548
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:03,720
We had 99 twice, didn't we?

4549
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:05,020
Yeah, 99, yeah.

4550
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:05,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4551
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:07,520
We can for sure beat that.

4552
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:08,000
Yeah.

4553
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:08,900
Guys, do not watch the VOD.

4554
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:11,820
Uh, three times, I swung off the map.

4555
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:13,540
Oh, that's fire.

4556
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:17,320
Oh, so that's why we couldn't get a hundred.

4557
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:20,980
Uh-huh.

4558
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:24,300
Bad game for me.

4559
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:27,280
You know, it might have been the right play.

4560
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:28,120
You don't give them all charge.

4561
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:29,260
Maybe that's actually the strike.

4562
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:29,520
Yeah, oh, yeah, that's true.

4563
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:32,600
Wait, but do you swing off when we're about to fight them?

4564
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:34,740
Or after the fight is over?

4565
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:37,860
That's the question.

4566
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:40,360
Oh, it was at the start.

4567
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:41,520
Oh, oh.

4568
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:43,300
Wait, do you have auto swing on, Tyler?

4569
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:43,960
Yeah, I do.

4570
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:45,040
But you always tell me to turn it off.

4571
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:46,960
Yeah, yeah, turn it off.

4572
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:50,180
Then you have to aim your swing or something, though.

4573
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:50,740
Oh, that's true.

4574
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:51,580
That's true.

4575
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:52,240
I'm not gonna switch anything up.

4576
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:54,460
Yeah, I wouldn't switch it up.

4577
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:56,880
Apparently, they were the best team.

4578
02:28:57,040 --> 02:28:57,400
Is that true?

4579
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:57,960
Yeah, yeah.

4580
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,480
We're the closest team to beat them.

4581
02:28:59,480 --> 02:28:59,680
Nice.

4582
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:00,000
Okay.

4583
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:00,740
I left the lobby.

4584
02:29:00,820 --> 02:29:01,540
He's gonna have to re-invite me.

4585
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:03,400
What are we saying?

4586
02:29:03,580 --> 02:29:04,340
We're supposed to say in one.

4587
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:04,760
Okay.

4588
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:09,500
Uh, I didn't get the invite because I was in the winning stream.

4589
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:10,300
Oh, sorry.

4590
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:11,100
The losing screen.

4591
02:29:11,820 --> 02:29:12,800
Uh, there we go.

4592
02:29:14,780 --> 02:29:16,140
Wait, who's team is this now?

4593
02:29:16,420 --> 02:29:17,280
Um, summits.

4594
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:18,920
Yeah, summits team.

4595
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:20,480
Oh, they actually might be decent.

4596
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:24,480
And then after... Yeah, no, they run triple res, so...

4597
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:26,180
Okay.

4598
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:28,700
There we go.

4599
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:29,280
Nice.

4600
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:36,970
We definitely... I think, for sure, we could've beat Strauss' team.

4601
02:29:37,150 --> 02:29:38,670
We just had a bad banline.

4602
02:29:41,890 --> 02:29:42,350
Yeah.

4603
02:29:42,810 --> 02:29:43,130
Yeah.

4604
02:29:43,830 --> 02:29:46,290
Yeah, I don't think we give, uh, space Magneto.

4605
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:47,670
No.

4606
02:29:48,070 --> 02:29:49,070
And we gotta protect Rocket.

4607
02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:50,590
Unless they ban Rocket.

4608
02:29:55,450 --> 02:29:57,050
Hey, guys, you good to go?

4609
02:29:57,250 --> 02:29:57,550
We're gonna fire the game.

4610
02:29:57,550 --> 02:29:57,990
Yep, we're good.

4611
02:29:58,390 --> 02:29:59,110
Arr, Maxi!

4612
02:29:59,250 --> 02:29:59,450
Arr!

4613
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:00,870
Let's do it.

4614
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:01,970
Arr.

4615
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:05,690
Okay, they have a Luna player.

4616
02:30:06,430 --> 02:30:07,150
Uh...

4617
02:30:07,150 --> 02:30:07,790
Hela player.

4618
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:09,730
Help me.

4619
02:30:11,090 --> 02:30:11,810
Um...

4620
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:12,370
I think...

4621
02:30:12,370 --> 02:30:12,930
Ban Luna.

4622
02:30:13,210 --> 02:30:13,830
Ban Hela.

4623
02:30:15,470 --> 02:30:17,250
Protect Rocket, obviously.

4624
02:30:18,670 --> 02:30:21,210
Then we can just ban whatever else after, honestly.

4625
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:24,170
Probably...

4626
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:26,870
If they're running triple res, we can just ban Star-Lord.

4627
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:28,870
Wait, so am I going Hulk?

4628
02:30:29,470 --> 02:30:30,630
No, not this one.

4629
02:30:30,910 --> 02:30:30,990
No, no, no, no.

4630
02:30:31,150 --> 02:30:31,850
Not this one.

4631
02:30:32,470 --> 02:30:33,290
You're going...

4632
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:35,170
We're going Hulk against Necro's team.

4633
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:35,890
Okay.

4634
02:30:36,370 --> 02:30:37,070
So not the same.

4635
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:37,510
In the finals, right?

4636
02:30:37,790 --> 02:30:38,150
Yeah, yeah.

4637
02:30:38,250 --> 02:30:38,750
The finals.

4638
02:30:40,450 --> 02:30:40,850
Yeah, of course.

4639
02:30:40,850 --> 02:30:42,610
Yeah, for that 250k.

4640
02:30:45,050 --> 02:30:46,590
What a life-changing amount of money.

4641
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:48,150
We need to win, guys.

4642
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:48,750
Yeah.

4643
02:30:48,930 --> 02:30:49,190
I think you're adults.

4644
02:30:49,730 --> 02:30:51,750
I could go to your kid's college tuition.

4645
02:30:52,490 --> 02:30:52,670
True!

4646
02:30:54,570 --> 02:30:56,890
Yeah, win for your kid's college.

4647
02:30:58,450 --> 02:30:59,390
Any kids here, guys?

4648
02:30:59,530 --> 02:30:59,690
Anybody?

4649
02:30:59,810 --> 02:31:00,950
No, that's just you, brother.

4650
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:03,510
That's just you, brother.

4651
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:04,350
Hey, G.

4652
02:31:11,330 --> 02:31:12,190
Dectela, okay.

4653
02:31:13,630 --> 02:31:14,690
Oh, they banned triple support.

4654
02:31:16,110 --> 02:31:16,430
They did.

4655
02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:17,790
Triple res.

4656
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:19,130
Or they banned triple...

4657
02:31:19,130 --> 02:31:20,410
Yeah, they ran triple res.

4658
02:31:20,770 --> 02:31:21,070
They banned...

4659
02:31:21,070 --> 02:31:21,990
Maybe they go dive here.

4660
02:31:22,050 --> 02:31:22,690
They're banning Emma.

4661
02:31:22,870 --> 02:31:23,510
They're banning...

4662
02:31:24,430 --> 02:31:25,190
Triple cons?

4663
02:31:25,930 --> 02:31:26,630
I think...

4664
02:31:26,630 --> 02:31:27,710
I think ban cap.

4665
02:31:28,730 --> 02:31:29,470
They're going to run dive.

4666
02:31:29,770 --> 02:31:31,690
Yeah, I'm down for the cap ban.

4667
02:31:32,210 --> 02:31:33,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4668
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:41,980
I think I'm just going to protect Punisher.

4669
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:44,920
You wanna go for it?

4670
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:45,100
Okay.

4671
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:45,500
Yeah.

4672
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:46,780
I think we play that here.

4673
02:31:55,910 --> 02:31:56,990
They probably protect...

4674
02:32:04,580 --> 02:32:04,900
Yeah.

4675
02:32:05,420 --> 02:32:05,640
Okay.

4676
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:07,160
No, it's fine.

4677
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:07,980
I ban Mag now.

4678
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:09,960
You ban Mag?

4679
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:10,860
And then what do you want me to go?

4680
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:11,860
Strange?

4681
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:13,420
Yeah, you can...

4682
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:14,340
You can do...

4683
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:15,260
You can do strange.

4684
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:16,280
These guys are weird.

4685
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:17,780
No, this is perfect.

4686
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:20,360
We get to Rocket Punisher now without Mag being in the game.

4687
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:21,440
That's true.

4688
02:32:22,060 --> 02:32:22,880
Pick your hero.

4689
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:23,940
Or villain.

4690
02:32:24,140 --> 02:32:24,860
I'm not judging.

4691
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:29,860
I do think for Z, do we want to do...

4692
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:34,180
Because it can be sometimes hard to like coordinate that.

4693
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:37,540
Does Doki maybe want to Rocket or...?

4694
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:39,840
No, but Lydia can only...

4695
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:40,440
Okay, okay, okay.

4696
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:40,540
Just say...

4697
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:41,660
Okay, just put...

4698
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:42,480
Just press...

4699
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:44,220
Just say the letter and then she'll put it down.

4700
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:45,280
I don't know how familiar she is, that's all.

4701
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:45,940
Okay.

4702
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:47,960
Yeah, just say the letter and then Lydia when...

4703
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:48,200
Got it.

4704
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:48,760
It's Z, right?

4705
02:32:49,220 --> 02:32:49,760
Is that the letter?

4706
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:50,400
Yeah, Z, Z.

4707
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:54,360
So, when you hear Gale say Z, just put it down and be next to Gale whenever you can.

4708
02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:55,200
Okay, okay, okay.

4709
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:56,620
Okay, so am I supposed to put...

4710
02:32:56,620 --> 02:33:01,780
Am I supposed to put the Zed close to you or am I supposed to put it behind a wall?

4711
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:03,340
No, no, it won't get destroyed.

4712
02:33:03,660 --> 02:33:04,360
Like right on top of me.

4713
02:33:04,760 --> 02:33:06,380
It won't get destroyed, so just put it...

4714
02:33:06,380 --> 02:33:07,680
Just follow Gale everywhere.

4715
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:08,520
Just follow him.

4716
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:09,820
You don't have to follow anyone else.

4717
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:11,140
Just follow this guy.

4718
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:12,020
The guy that's shooting.

4719
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:12,760
Okay.

4720
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:14,060
That guy, just follow him.

4721
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:17,280
And then when he yells Z, just press Z next to him.

4722
02:33:17,540 --> 02:33:18,940
So we're like follow just like always.

4723
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:19,560
Yeah, yeah.

4724
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:20,000
So I'm like...

4725
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:21,640
I'm not gonna TV by the way.

4726
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:22,120
I'm not gonna TV.

4727
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:22,840
Why do you need to pocket me?

4728
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:24,720
Because I'm extremely vulnerable in this character.

4729
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:27,000
All right, and I'm just worried for backlight against our healers.

4730
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:27,440
You're gonna be up.

4731
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:29,700
You're gonna be by yourself on this track, so just be a little careful.

4732
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:30,620
Yeah, just be careful.

4733
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:32,400
All right.

4734
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:32,920
Let's go, teammates.

4735
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:33,560
Alright.

4736
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:37,740
I'll swap to lowkey if it's like in here running like hard dive.

4737
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:39,040
Capture the mission area.

4738
02:33:39,380 --> 02:33:39,880
Got it?

4739
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:43,880
Once I saved lives with a scalpel.

4740
02:33:44,220 --> 02:33:46,080
Now I do it with a spell.

4741
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:46,820
Right here?

4742
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:48,500
Here we go.

4743
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:51,400
Oh, they're also ready.

4744
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:53,180
And they have bugs.

4745
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:53,900
Right here?

4746
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:54,220
Is it right here?

4747
02:33:55,080 --> 02:33:56,080
Wait, does it say Z?

4748
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:57,360
Z, Z, Z, Z.

4749
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:57,640
Z, Z, Z.

4750
02:33:58,060 --> 02:33:58,740
That's much better.

4751
02:33:59,440 --> 02:33:59,880
Gru one!

4752
02:33:59,980 --> 02:34:00,380
roux one, roux one, roux one.

4753
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:02,600
Ah, they have play and they have punishment charge up.

4754
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:03,560
Oh, she runs?

4755
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:05,580
She runs two, I basically got res.

4756
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:09,400
Groot already use Hahahahser.

4757
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:10,920
Grush half, Volks front.

4758
02:34:11,060 --> 02:34:11,240
I got it.

4759
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:11,780
I got it.

4760
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,080
I got it.

4761
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:12,620
I'm walking.

4762
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:14,520
Everyone walk.

4763
02:34:15,340 --> 02:34:15,800
You're not walking.

4764
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:17,760
Judas doesn't work.

4765
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:20,020
I'm helping.

4766
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:20,320
I'm helping.

4767
02:34:20,540 --> 02:34:21,640
I'm giving issue...

4768
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:21,900
They're loading.

4769
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,340
I have the back, I have the back.

4770
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:24,600
I think.

4771
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:25,380
Honey, honey, honey.

4772
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:26,920
Okay.

4773
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:28,260
I'm back, I'm back.

4774
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:30,140
Groot really low, Groot really low.

4775
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:31,160
Uh, 2-1, flip.

4776
02:34:32,820 --> 02:34:33,960
I am shielding for him.

4777
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:34,480
I shielded.

4778
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:36,040
Okay, I have plenty ult soon.

4779
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:39,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4780
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:41,560
He has it, he has it, he has it, he has a reset.

4781
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:43,920
I'm really in here.

4782
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:44,660
He got another reset.

4783
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:46,860
Another one?

4784
02:34:47,660 --> 02:34:47,800
All right.

4785
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:49,580
Okay, you got it off of me.

4786
02:34:50,220 --> 02:34:51,040
I'll stay on.

4787
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:54,100
I got it so fast.

4788
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:55,060
Yeah, he did.

4789
02:34:55,560 --> 02:34:56,060
It's fine.

4790
02:34:56,400 --> 02:35:02,780
Uh, okay, so, Rocket, all you have to do is, as soon as I call for ult, just ult down and I'll ult with you.

4791
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:05,300
Uh, okay, I haven't got ult, just yet, okay.

4792
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:07,280
I'll let her heal a little bit more.

4793
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:07,800
I'll let her heal.

4794
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:09,280
Oh, no.

4795
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:11,540
It's fine, just wait, we have to wait.

4796
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:13,240
It's fine, we have to wait.

4797
02:35:17,220 --> 02:35:20,880
Oh, we'll run Rocket out first, because we have the Gale combo.

4798
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:20,880
I'll go.

4799
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:22,920
I'll blast, so...

4800
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:24,280
Let's go, I'm walking, I'm looking for this.

4801
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:26,360
Stuck.

4802
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:29,500
Shoot the turret left side.

4803
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:31,080
Yeah, I'm shooting.

4804
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:31,740
He's off his outfit.

4805
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,380
Okay, can we...

4806
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:33,780
Do you hear?

4807
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:34,260
Rocket, okay?

4808
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:35,220
Yeah, she's here, she's here.

4809
02:35:35,940 --> 02:35:36,440
Rocket, okay?

4810
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:38,980
Rocket, okay?

4811
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:40,540
I'm protecting it.

4812
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:41,300
I'll kill Hello, Hello.

4813
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:41,520
Nice.

4814
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:42,500
Group behind.

4815
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:43,040
Group right here.

4816
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:43,820
Do I get that as well?

4817
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:45,600
No, no, no.

4818
02:35:45,660 --> 02:35:46,240
No, you don't.

4819
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:47,140
Yeah, fine, fine.

4820
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,840
Behind, behind, Bucky, behind, Bucky, behind.

4821
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:50,540
Bucky, Bucky.

4822
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:51,640
He's low, he's low, he's low.

4823
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:52,640
I got it, I got it, I got it.

4824
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:55,480
Actually, I will ult the...

4825
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:57,720
Wait, actually, you should ult the Groot ult list if you can.

4826
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:00,020
Lydia, you don't use Z when he punishes her ult.

4827
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:01,480
It's only a different time.

4828
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:01,960
Oh, okay.

4829
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:03,700
Yeah, because I think he'll just kill first me.

4830
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:08,260
I have, um...

4831
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:08,460
I'm turning.

4832
02:36:08,660 --> 02:36:09,360
I'm gonna protect you a little bit here.

4833
02:36:11,980 --> 02:36:12,820
So long, turret.

4834
02:36:13,160 --> 02:36:14,240
I have no...

4835
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:15,180
I have ult, I have ult.

4836
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:15,760
They have Groot ult, they have Groot ult.

4837
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:16,960
I have ult too.

4838
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:18,400
I can block Groot ult, I can block Groot ult.

4839
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:19,580
We are undefeatable!

4840
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:21,320
I have to go and get something.

4841
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:21,880
Groot ult.

4842
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:23,120
Where's that?

4843
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:24,540
Oh wait, you're not ult.

4844
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:25,160
Oh, I thought you were ult.

4845
02:36:25,460 --> 02:36:26,460
Sorry, that was our bad.

4846
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:27,060
Oh shit.

4847
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:27,780
I thought you were ult.

4848
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:28,200
It's fine, it's fine.

4849
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:30,700
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

4850
02:36:31,820 --> 02:36:33,380
Groot one, Groot one, Groot one, Groot one.

4851
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:34,840
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4852
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:37,240
They're gonna have...

4853
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:38,420
Oh, I'm sad.

4854
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:39,440
Shooting, shooting, hello.

4855
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:39,880
I'm ult.

4856
02:36:40,940 --> 02:36:42,120
I'm gonna die, probably?

4857
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:43,500
I'm dead, yeah.

4858
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:44,300
I'm just dying, fine.

4859
02:36:44,580 --> 02:36:45,540
I can TPS, maybe?

4860
02:36:45,540 --> 02:36:49,340
Do you have TP or save it for Recontest?

4861
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:51,780
We should save it for Contest.

4862
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:52,780
Oh, back up, back up.

4863
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:54,240
I don't give up.

4864
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:55,240
They don't have support ult, do they?

4865
02:36:55,380 --> 02:36:57,020
Because I have 20 ult here.

4866
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:00,940
Oh, they used Mantis...

4867
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:02,160
They only once...

4868
02:37:02,160 --> 02:37:03,360
Yeah, you could, you could.

4869
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:04,580
Break that punish turret.

4870
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:05,380
Yeah, yeah, shooting.

4871
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:08,580
I'm gonna do some damage here.

4872
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:09,440
Aw, shit.

4873
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:09,480
Aw, shit.

4874
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:09,820
I'm gonna get my ult.

4875
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:13,120
I can't.

4876
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:13,520
I got it.

4877
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,080
I got it, I got it.

4878
02:37:14,820 --> 02:37:15,200
Are we going?

4879
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:15,980
Watch Hello, left side.

4880
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:17,220
Let's just walk up.

4881
02:37:17,360 --> 02:37:18,420
Can we walk up and...

4882
02:37:18,420 --> 02:37:18,560
Yeah, just walk.

4883
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:20,200
Yeah, I'm ready, I'm ready.

4884
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:20,620
Can I walk with me?

4885
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:20,880
Ready?

4886
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:22,220
Three, two, one.

4887
02:37:22,380 --> 02:37:22,680
Let's go, let's go.

4888
02:37:24,820 --> 02:37:25,860
Yeah, they had him.

4889
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:27,120
I'm just hitting you, bud.

4890
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:30,140
I'm sorry, we have...

4891
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:31,000
Wait, I have team...

4892
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:31,740
I didn't do that right now.

4893
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,080
They had to die for UTP.

4894
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:33,900
Yeah, yeah.

4895
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:35,200
Make sure we body bossed.

4896
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:36,720
I tried to think it's done by Hellraire or something.

4897
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:37,480
Yeah, I'll push shield.

4898
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:39,000
I'll push shield in front of you.

4899
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:39,320
That's fine.

4900
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:39,540
That's fine.

4901
02:37:40,300 --> 02:37:41,300
Lily, back up, Lily.

4902
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:41,720
No, no, no.

4903
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:43,040
Just back up, back up.

4904
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:44,100
Okay.

4905
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:46,960
It's gonna have to be on path though, I think.

4906
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:47,560
I pushed shield on you.

4907
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:48,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4908
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:49,600
You really have to do as fast as you can here.

4909
02:37:50,140 --> 02:37:50,380
There we go.

4910
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:52,420
Oh, you're gonna do that and I'm gonna swap to Loki.

4911
02:37:52,780 --> 02:37:53,640
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

4912
02:37:54,220 --> 02:37:55,360
I'm on Gruden, Gruden Armand.

4913
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:56,040
Gruden Armand isolated.

4914
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:56,600
Grits by himself.

4915
02:37:57,240 --> 02:37:58,480
I'm dead, I'm dead, I got ran out.

4916
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:00,720
I won't really soon, but...

4917
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:04,420
You are still... I have the... Yeah, I think you got to save.

4918
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:05,640
I don't think you win this turn.

4919
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:08,600
Well... Hmm...

4920
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:11,380
No, guys, I don't know what's happening.

4921
02:38:11,620 --> 02:38:13,460
I just one-shot over and over and over again.

4922
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:15,880
Yeah, it might be a little hard to play Venomate.

4923
02:38:16,020 --> 02:38:17,100
Yeah, I think that.

4924
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:19,420
I think it doesn't try anything else, to be honest.

4925
02:38:19,780 --> 02:38:21,840
I play Hulk and think a little.

4926
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:24,080
Hulk is probably the better play.

4927
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:27,880
Because, I mean, wait, the team still exists for Strange, right?

4928
02:38:28,140 --> 02:38:28,520
Strange Hulk?

4929
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:31,320
I think Hulk is shit on live, Bucky, in front of Triss.

4930
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:33,160
Oh, it doesn't exist anymore.

4931
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:34,500
No, it doesn't exist.

4932
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:39,500
I mean, I don't think things to play, though, because you can walled off by Groot, you die.

4933
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:41,680
So...

4934
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:42,960
I guess Venom it is?

4935
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:47,240
I think for our team, Groot is our biggest weakness.

4936
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:48,520
We have to ban Groot.

4937
02:38:50,340 --> 02:38:50,740
Yeah...

4938
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,260
Unless Tyler could try it, maybe.

4939
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:55,100
Try it.

4940
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:55,520
Try what?

4941
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:56,200
It's really easy.

4942
02:38:56,200 --> 02:38:58,020
Yeah, I feel like Groot is...

4943
02:38:58,560 --> 02:38:59,140
It's a very simple character.

4944
02:38:59,140 --> 02:39:03,740
The thing is, it's also, like, high risk for him, because he can die really, really fast on Groot.

4945
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:03,980
Let's just try it.

4946
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:06,200
Like, this is... we're in seating, so I think it's gonna be true.

4947
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:06,600
Yeah.

4948
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:12,960
Okay, basically, Tyler, use your E walls behind someone, and it does extra damage when you hit them, and they're near it.

4949
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:13,720
Yeah.

4950
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:15,260
You're just the Fortnite character.

4951
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:16,700
Yeah, you're playing Fortnite.

4952
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:19,600
You press E behind someone, and then throw a right click, left click.

4953
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:19,940
That's it.

4954
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:19,940
Yeah.

4955
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:21,760
It doesn't matter what ult they use, you just ult second.

4956
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:26,320
And then your shift is your big wall, and that is... you stay near that, and... wait, they TP next to us!

4957
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:26,820
I'm gonna ult this!

4958
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:27,660
Okay.

4959
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:29,020
Huge ult!

4960
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:29,380
I think.

4961
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:29,760
I lied.

4962
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:30,260
I hit no one.

4963
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:30,600
Okay.

4964
02:39:31,460 --> 02:39:33,400
You know, I'm, like, behind them.

4965
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:34,960
I gotta... I gotta... I gotta do it.

4966
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:35,840
That is tough, actually.

4967
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:37,840
Huge.

4968
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:39,440
Do I ult?

4969
02:39:39,580 --> 02:39:39,960
Do I ult?

4970
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:42,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4971
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:43,220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4972
02:39:43,220 --> 02:39:43,740
Oh, fucking hell.

4973
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,540
I didn't see this strange.

4974
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:45,440
Goddamn it, my bad.

4975
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:49,760
Wait, they're a rocket beacon here.

4976
02:39:49,900 --> 02:39:51,000
They have no beacon if we get a kill.

4977
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:51,460
Yeah.

4978
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:53,520
They did it.

4979
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:53,780
Okay.

4980
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,220
Uh, just walk up here.

4981
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:58,480
He captures a mission area.

4982
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:00,120
Um...

4983
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:01,860
With you up here?

4984
02:40:04,260 --> 02:40:04,620
Nice.

4985
02:40:05,140 --> 02:40:05,500
Nice.

4986
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:07,080
Nice nice nice nice nice.

4987
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:11,220
I pulled somebody, I don't know who...

4988
02:40:11,220 --> 02:40:11,760
Oh, just LOS.

4989
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:12,000
LOS.

4990
02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:12,820
Back back back back.

4991
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:13,060
Back back back back.

4992
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:13,720
You want me to ult.

4993
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:14,420
You want me to ult?

4994
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:15,040
Yes, yes, yes.

4995
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:16,340
Day team.

4996
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:17,100
Oh.

4997
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:19,420
I fucked up the push.

4998
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:20,280
That's my bet.

4999
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:22,020
I fucked up the push.

5000
02:40:22,100 --> 02:40:22,860
Kill kill is killed his killer.

5001
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:23,880
Strange low max change low!

5002
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:25,140
Can you Z?

5003
02:40:25,220 --> 02:40:25,460
He's walking Z.

5004
02:40:27,460 --> 02:40:28,100
Right here, right here.

5005
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:28,680
I'm walking, I'm walking.

5006
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,060
I pulled the hell off.

5007
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:31,500
Thank you, thank you.

5008
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:32,620
I got beacon?

5009
02:40:33,380 --> 02:40:34,200
Can you hard push?

5010
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:34,620
Can you hard push?

5011
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:34,820
Yeah.

5012
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:35,480
Yeah.

5013
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:38,060
So I have soldier to the left.

5014
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:38,440
Hurry up, hurry up.

5015
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:39,560
Carry me, carry me.

5016
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:41,180
I really don't want to go on...

5017
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:43,260
I'm gonna go on mantis, mantis.

5018
02:40:45,220 --> 02:40:45,840
Oh, I'm asleep.

5019
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:46,780
Mantis on mega, can we kill?

5020
02:40:47,440 --> 02:40:47,960
Oh no.

5021
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:49,340
I'm res.

5022
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:50,840
Strange one, strange one.

5023
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:52,720
Strange one, strange one, strange one.

5024
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:55,260
Do I ult?

5025
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:56,220
Not now.

5026
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:56,760
Not yet.

5027
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:57,440
Not yet, not yet.

5028
02:40:57,800 --> 02:41:00,600
Okay, your ult is basically like Zarya Grav in Overwatch.

5029
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:01,560
Okay.

5030
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:02,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5031
02:41:03,880 --> 02:41:07,720
So you're gonna use that when they walk through... I can try and call for you.

5032
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:08,620
Okay.

5033
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:13,640
And try to put your small wall behind them if you can, because it'll do more damage.

5034
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:14,480
Don't pop, don't pop.

5035
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:18,700
Can you get ready to Z?

5036
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:20,740
Can you do it here?

5037
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:26,560
Oh, you can look for Tyler.

5038
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:29,420
Big, big, huge on the back line.

5039
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:29,920
Oh no.

5040
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:31,000
Nice.

5041
02:41:31,460 --> 02:41:31,780
Fantastical.

5042
02:41:32,380 --> 02:41:32,700
That's huge.

5043
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:33,080
That's huge.

5044
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:34,360
Fantastical.

5045
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:36,180
I pulled him, I pulled him, I pulled him.

5046
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:38,880
Nice.

5047
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:41,620
We can get the Mantis.

5048
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:42,280
We can kill his Hella maybe?

5049
02:41:42,540 --> 02:41:43,520
Stagger the Hella, Stagger Hella.

5050
02:41:44,220 --> 02:41:45,300
He's really low, he's really low.

5051
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:45,900
Nice, nice, nice.

5052
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:46,520
I got you.

5053
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:50,960
All right, I'm gonna let you two build your ult.

5054
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:51,840
I'm not gonna do anything.

5055
02:41:54,380 --> 02:41:54,860
Build your ult.

5056
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,180
Yeah, if we can get rocket ult here, I'm gonna farm for rocket ult.

5057
02:41:57,260 --> 02:41:57,720
I'm gonna take damage.

5058
02:41:58,600 --> 02:41:59,800
Yeah, I'm 83%.

5059
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:01,320
Yeah, yeah, just keep scramming, keep scramming, it's good.

5060
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:02,060
Keep going.

5061
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:03,660
90.

5062
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:06,720
I'm gonna look for ult here, actually.

5063
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:07,620
Is he right here?

5064
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:08,680
He's low, he's low.

5065
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:09,340
No, no, I'm lucky.

5066
02:42:09,340 --> 02:42:10,520
Uh, oh, uh, sorry.

5067
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:11,120
I went down.

5068
02:42:11,140 --> 02:42:11,720
We both have ult.

5069
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:12,260
I'm just gonna go first.

5070
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:12,920
I can ult.

5071
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:14,240
Now, by the way, if he won ult.

5072
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:15,620
Yeah, ult ult ult ult.

5073
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:38,540
Can you ult ult?

5074
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:44,920
They might... They have solo Groot, wait, solo tank Groot, they use Groot and Bucky ult for that fight.

5075
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:45,340
Oh, they have Venom, wait.

5076
02:42:45,820 --> 02:42:46,600
They still have Hull ult.

5077
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:48,460
Venom might go for touch.

5078
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:49,320
Can we just burn them?

5079
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:50,580
Yeah, get rid of Z.

5080
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:52,480
Uh, the... Where?

5081
02:42:52,900 --> 02:42:52,900
Where?

5082
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:52,980
Where?

5083
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:54,120
Oh, point, oh, point.

5084
02:42:54,380 --> 02:42:54,760
Z, Z, Z.

5085
02:42:56,500 --> 02:42:57,360
I got him, I got him.

5086
02:42:58,140 --> 02:42:59,280
He's hyper, hyper, hyper, hyper, hyper, hyper, super.

5087
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:02,640
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

5088
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:05,100
Nice.

5089
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:08,520
Wait, Tyler might be a Groot.

5090
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:09,740
Wait, I like Homo.

5091
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:11,100
Nice.

5092
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:12,600
Groot pick.

5093
02:43:13,820 --> 02:43:14,440
Groot God.

5094
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:17,840
The Tonka tea on the Groot.

5095
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:20,420
Only thing is, you have to be careful.

5096
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:22,720
They didn't have one that round, so it's fine.

5097
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:25,160
But if Strange blocks it, then it does nothing.

5098
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:26,580
But they didn't have a Strange, so you're fine.

5099
02:43:30,360 --> 02:43:31,120
What are they out there?

5100
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:32,900
Did they use anything other than punish all?

5101
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:38,000
Okay, so my E, I'm trying to put behind them.

5102
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:41,060
Yeah, so, wait, which one is your E?

5103
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:42,100
Is that your big wall or your small wall?

5104
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,040
Ironwood wall.

5105
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:45,540
That's the- wait, put it up real quick.

5106
02:43:46,180 --> 02:43:47,120
Shift is small, I think.

5107
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:48,920
Oh, shift is the small wall.

5108
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:51,500
Okay, you wanna put the small wall behind them, sorry.

5109
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:52,720
Oh, okay.

5110
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:57,060
And then the big wall, you wanna keep, like, you can use that to, like, make a cover, basically.

5111
02:43:57,220 --> 02:44:00,760
Like, if we're taking a lot of damage, or if you stay near it, it'll give you heals, too.

5112
02:44:00,900 --> 02:44:01,560
It's pretty good.

5113
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:03,700
You can block off the healers from being able to...

5114
02:44:03,700 --> 02:44:04,080
Yeah, yeah.

5115
02:44:04,300 --> 02:44:04,420
Perfect.

5116
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:05,660
Four, three, two...

5117
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:07,240
Um, I'm not gonna TP.

5118
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:08,680
Actually, yeah, I'm not gonna TP.

5119
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:10,620
All you need to do is capture the missionary.

5120
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,100
That's fine.

5121
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:11,720
Yeah.

5122
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:13,740
Well, careful for their TP, though.

5123
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:14,480
They might do that thing again.

5124
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:14,840
Be careful.

5125
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:15,360
Get ready.

5126
02:44:15,360 --> 02:44:15,540
Okay.

5127
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:16,200
Yeah.

5128
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:18,840
I am grouped.

5129
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:20,280
I am grouped.

5130
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:22,240
They're not doing it.

5131
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:23,200
I think we're okay.

5132
02:44:23,860 --> 02:44:25,220
Okay, just be ready to see me, okay?

5133
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:29,320
Hey, what's up, Rocket?

5134
02:44:30,460 --> 02:44:30,580
Hey, what's up, Rocket?

5135
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:31,220
They-they're-they're turning, careful?

5136
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:32,380
Can you use the up here?

5137
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:32,640
Nice.

5138
02:44:33,140 --> 02:44:33,680
Oh, I have no shield!

5139
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:33,940
No shield!

5140
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:34,260
Shoot, bro.

5141
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:36,880
Wait, Groot's close right!

5142
02:44:37,100 --> 02:44:37,820
I have to go point here, though.

5143
02:44:37,820 --> 02:44:38,080
Go ahead, go ahead.

5144
02:44:38,300 --> 02:44:38,920
I'm home, Matt.

5145
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:39,800
I'm home, Matt.

5146
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:40,700
Oh, we're at the run point.

5147
02:44:41,820 --> 02:44:42,700
I gave you guys all that.

5148
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:43,320
Nice one.

5149
02:44:43,400 --> 02:44:43,400
Nice one.

5150
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:43,560
Nice one.

5151
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:44,820
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

5152
02:44:44,820 --> 02:44:45,540
Where is he?

5153
02:44:45,980 --> 02:44:46,920
I don't see him!

5154
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:47,960
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead!

5155
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:49,980
We don't have rocket, be careful!

5156
02:44:50,300 --> 02:44:52,340
Back up, back up!

5157
02:44:52,360 --> 02:44:54,780
Should I be on group?

5158
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:56,340
No, no, no!

5159
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:57,580
Don't be on group!

5160
02:44:58,740 --> 02:44:59,940
Just be near Gale!

5161
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:00,780
I have ult!

5162
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:03,520
I'll support you dead!

5163
02:45:05,380 --> 02:45:06,420
Don't be on group.

5164
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:07,720
Just be near Gale.

5165
02:45:08,760 --> 02:45:09,860
Don't go up, just be near Gale!

5166
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:10,600
Don't go up!

5167
02:45:10,660 --> 02:45:12,320
Wait until your entire team is here!

5168
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:13,060
Play back!

5169
02:45:13,460 --> 02:45:14,560
Come back, come back, come back.

5170
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:19,440
Because they can... When you're in support, just wait for the entire team to be in front of you before you go up.

5171
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:22,380
Okay, they used Rocket ult.

5172
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:24,580
We could look for a Groot ult here.

5173
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:26,300
They used Bucky ult, too.

5174
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:31,780
Wait, Tyler, you can maybe look for it here.

5175
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:32,080
Hold up.

5176
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:34,200
I'm trying my hardest.

5177
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:36,920
Yeah, Tyler, if you see one, you can...

5178
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:37,700
Wait, you want me to death?

5179
02:45:38,320 --> 02:45:39,140
Wait, it's a huge ult!

5180
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:39,860
It's a huge ult!

5181
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:41,100
It's actually huge!

5182
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:42,520
Kill Groot, Groot, Groot, Groot.

5183
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:43,500
Hard push, everyone push here.

5184
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Just don't have Gale, just don't have Gale.

5185
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:47,080
Oh, wait, he got Riz, he got Riz.

5186
02:45:47,460 --> 02:45:48,660
I can Q whenever you want.

5187
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:50,600
Oh, I'm on, drop the point.

5188
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:51,680
Bucky close, Bucky close.

5189
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:53,880
Oh, no.

5190
02:45:54,340 --> 02:45:55,240
He ulted, like...

5191
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:56,980
We are undefeatable!

5192
02:45:57,440 --> 02:45:58,720
Can we kill Hela after she lands?

5193
02:45:58,780 --> 02:45:59,840
Yeah, yeah, she's gonna be up top though.

5194
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:00,780
I don't know where she is.

5195
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:03,460
Oh, sorry, I...

5196
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:04,200
No, she's dead.

5197
02:46:05,820 --> 02:46:06,460
Big ult, big ult!

5198
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:07,760
Yeah, I'm on, I'm on Bucky.

5199
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:09,000
You're killing fantastic.

5200
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:10,700
Your team's capture product.

5201
02:46:11,940 --> 02:46:13,340
Mantis, Mantis, Mantis, Mantis.

5202
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:14,640
Mantis is one, Mantis is one.

5203
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:15,760
Hello, behind two, hello, behind two.

5204
02:46:17,020 --> 02:46:17,980
This guy's just getting goofy.

5205
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:19,400
Hello, hello?

5206
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:21,000
Oh, we got point, we got point.

5207
02:46:21,100 --> 02:46:22,300
We can stagger there, kill.

5208
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:23,440
Oh, guys, now kill Groot, now kill Groot.

5209
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:25,200
I pulled him, I pulled him.

5210
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:25,940
He's Groot.

5211
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:26,860
Very good.

5212
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:29,320
We can spam him up here if we take high ground.

5213
02:46:29,460 --> 02:46:29,840
We can spam him.

5214
02:46:31,060 --> 02:46:34,280
We'll use my ult first, Lydia, because we're gonna wait for Gale to get his ult.

5215
02:46:34,860 --> 02:46:35,440
I'll use my ult first.

5216
02:46:35,440 --> 02:46:35,940
Can we keep chasing him?

5217
02:46:37,080 --> 02:46:37,460
A little bit?

5218
02:46:37,660 --> 02:46:38,260
Scan them here?

5219
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:38,940
Can you just hook?

5220
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:40,840
My ult first.

5221
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:41,220
I can turn up here.

5222
02:46:43,180 --> 02:46:43,700
Can you shoot me?

5223
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:43,960
Nice.

5224
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:48,460
I'm gonna get ready back here.

5225
02:46:48,620 --> 02:46:49,560
I didn't play, buddy.

5226
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:51,640
I have no shield, no shield, no shield.

5227
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:52,300
Okay.

5228
02:46:52,500 --> 02:46:53,700
I'm gonna get hooked, I gotta be careful.

5229
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:54,760
I'm gonna get...

5230
02:46:54,760 --> 02:46:57,940
Actually, if Gale gets his ult, you ult with Gale, okay?

5231
02:46:57,940 --> 02:46:58,040
Okay.

5232
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:00,000
Okay combo with Gale.

5233
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:00,380
Can you rock it all?

5234
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:01,140
Can you rock it all right now?

5235
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:02,160
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go.

5236
02:47:02,820 --> 02:47:04,920
Rock it all, rock it all, rock it all.

5237
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:06,360
Gru, Gru, Gru fell apart.

5238
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:06,840
We can kill Gru.

5239
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:07,400
He's like by himself.

5240
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:09,120
Wake me up, wake me up.

5241
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:09,960
Where's the group going?

5242
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:10,320
You go on.

5243
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:11,040
On me, on me.

5244
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:12,660
Okay kill Gru behind, guys.

5245
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:13,280
We can kill Gru behind.

5246
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:15,740
He dropped, I mean Phil off.

5247
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:17,960
He's reset.

5248
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:18,980
There's people over here on the left.

5249
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:20,640
I can cut them off, maybe?

5250
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:21,180
If we push?

5251
02:47:21,560 --> 02:47:21,920
Yeah, yeah.

5252
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:22,180
Punisher.

5253
02:47:22,820 --> 02:47:23,340
Punisher can die?

5254
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:24,000
Oh, no.

5255
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:24,700
Really low.

5256
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:26,080
I think we can get these goals.

5257
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:27,260
I'm on point.

5258
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:27,860
I'm far, guys.

5259
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:30,680
We don't have here with us.

5260
02:47:31,060 --> 02:47:31,340
Okay.

5261
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:32,740
I'm putting down turret here.

5262
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:35,640
I'm low ground.

5263
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:36,300
How do I get the highest?

5264
02:47:36,680 --> 02:47:37,060
This is fine.

5265
02:47:37,180 --> 02:47:37,460
You can just jump.

5266
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:38,160
We're gonna back.

5267
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:38,380
We're gonna back.

5268
02:47:38,460 --> 02:47:38,460
We're gonna back.

5269
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:38,700
We're gonna back.

5270
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:39,480
No shield.

5271
02:47:40,280 --> 02:47:40,560
Okay.

5272
02:47:40,900 --> 02:47:41,540
I'm back in here.

5273
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:44,980
This is just hard.

5274
02:47:45,060 --> 02:47:45,680
I think we drop off.

5275
02:47:46,060 --> 02:47:46,560
Yeah, we have to drop.

5276
02:47:46,740 --> 02:47:47,160
Okay, yeah, we're back.

5277
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:47,760
Everyone back.

5278
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:48,100
Everyone back.

5279
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:49,320
Oh, it's fine.

5280
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,080
He's really low.

5281
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:53,060
Just let me know if he wanted to do that.

5282
02:47:53,400 --> 02:47:54,260
I almost have ult.

5283
02:47:54,560 --> 02:48:01,680
When the Groot drops, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

5284
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:05,320
Come on, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't have my thing, though.

5285
02:48:05,320 --> 02:48:06,620
Oh, I have ult really soon.

5286
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:07,100
I have ult.

5287
02:48:07,440 --> 02:48:08,260
I don't have my thing, though.

5288
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:09,420
Careful, careful.

5289
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:09,460
Beautiful.

5290
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:12,440
I'm ulting.

5291
02:48:16,360 --> 02:48:17,520
Grud 1, Grud 1!

5292
02:48:19,540 --> 02:48:20,660
Grud 2, one!

5293
02:48:20,700 --> 02:48:24,000
G monaster behind you guys!

5294
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:25,560
Where is your rocket?

5295
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:25,940
Okay.

5296
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:27,800
Punish your half.

5297
02:48:28,560 --> 02:48:29,240
Punish one, Punish one.

5298
02:48:29,880 --> 02:48:30,600
I'll be back with Penny.

5299
02:48:30,740 --> 02:48:31,200
I will be back with Penny.

5300
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:33,540
We got matters.

5301
02:48:33,700 --> 02:48:33,980
We got matters.

5302
02:48:34,720 --> 02:48:36,100
Rocket, Rocket, Rocket, Focus on Rocket!

5303
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:38,480
We'll get back in!

5304
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:44,480
I'm giving a shield.

5305
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:45,160
The one.

5306
02:48:45,220 --> 02:48:45,420
The one.

5307
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:45,700
The one.

5308
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:46,740
The one.

5309
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:47,320
The puncher's one.

5310
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:49,300
The fuck into the slaughterhouse.

5311
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:51,100
Do I ult?

5312
02:48:51,280 --> 02:48:51,460
Do I ult?

5313
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:52,520
This is the last fight.

5314
02:48:52,820 --> 02:48:54,180
Just do it and use it.

5315
02:48:55,440 --> 02:48:55,920
Nice.

5316
02:48:57,020 --> 02:48:57,500
Nice.

5317
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:58,200
Nice.

5318
02:48:58,200 --> 02:48:58,840
Let's go.

5319
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:01,600
Wait, maybe T1 Groot is the secret weapon.

5320
02:49:01,820 --> 02:49:02,680
I think so, yeah.

5321
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:06,220
You literally out-Grooted Flass.

5322
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:07,320
Wait.

5323
02:49:07,700 --> 02:49:08,660
Dude, he fell off the edge.

5324
02:49:11,180 --> 02:49:12,360
Yeah, he is, yeah.

5325
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:17,920
Now that's big.

5326
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:19,100
Now that's big.

5327
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:22,080
Hey, that was our last game of rounds, right?

5328
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:22,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5329
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:23,700
Yeah, it was the round robin.

5330
02:49:23,800 --> 02:49:25,420
I don't know what the other team's records are.

5331
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:26,660
Maybe Nekro's team is undefeated.

5332
02:49:26,780 --> 02:49:27,740
We might be too, though.

5333
02:49:28,540 --> 02:49:32,360
Let's see how Shroud... We lost to Shroud and Nekro's.

5334
02:49:32,560 --> 02:49:35,680
So Shroud might have won all his games as well.

5335
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:36,580
Other than...

5336
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:37,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5337
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:39,360
Yeah, he only lost one, I think.

5338
02:49:41,360 --> 02:49:43,400
Alright, well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

5339
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:44,460
I'm taking a party break.

5340
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:45,520
Jeez!

5341
02:49:46,220 --> 02:49:47,240
Good round robin.

5342
02:49:48,280 --> 02:49:49,100
That was excellent.

5343
02:49:49,900 --> 02:49:51,360
Alright, these next games...

5344
02:49:51,740 --> 02:49:52,860
Lot on the line.

5345
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:56,060
Oh...

5346
02:49:56,060 --> 02:49:57,960
Those were the warm-up games.

5347
02:49:58,120 --> 02:49:59,580
The next game is the real one.

5348
02:50:00,220 --> 02:50:02,080
Are they best of three, or...?

5349
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:03,100
No, it's best of one.

5350
02:50:03,520 --> 02:50:05,320
Until we get to semis, I believe.

5351
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:09,740
I think semis is when it starts being best of three.

5352
02:50:16,300 --> 02:50:17,120
I'm gonna look at it.

5353
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:17,940
I'm just gonna look at it.

5354
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:19,300
Look at the rules.

5355
02:50:24,800 --> 02:50:25,240
Yeah.

5356
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:28,000
Oh, no, finally...

5357
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,160
Apparently every game is best of one until finals.

5358
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:31,480
Damn!

5359
02:50:31,780 --> 02:50:33,740
So we can just lose once, and we're just like going home?

5360
02:50:34,180 --> 02:50:34,360
Yeah.

5361
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:35,620
Oh, fuck it.

5362
02:50:35,780 --> 02:50:37,320
And it's not domination map.

5363
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:38,180
It's gonna be either...

5364
02:50:39,280 --> 02:50:41,060
It's gonna be the other two.

5365
02:50:47,860 --> 02:50:48,380
Oh...

5366
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:51,020
Yeah, best knockout.

5367
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:51,900
Yeah, it's knockout.

5368
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:53,420
Single elimination, one game.

5369
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:55,980
Oh, these games are intense!

5370
02:50:57,260 --> 02:50:58,140
I'm having fun.

5371
02:50:58,880 --> 02:51:01,200
I'm playing every support right now.

5372
02:51:02,860 --> 02:51:05,240
I have to be the very flexible person.

5373
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:09,820
I gotta...

5374
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:12,240
I gotta flex in everything.

5375
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:20,080
And I'm not used to flexing in so many different characters.

5376
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:22,380
Wait, apparently...

5377
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:26,080
Shroud and Ten's team is like 1-1 right now.

5378
02:51:26,720 --> 02:51:27,520
Or one round.

5379
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:29,380
Oh.

5380
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:30,300
Wait, what do you mean?

5381
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:30,860
So...

5382
02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:32,180
Each of them won one round.

5383
02:51:32,380 --> 02:51:33,040
So if they...

5384
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:34,960
If Shroud's team loses, we get a bye.

5385
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:36,660
I think?

5386
02:51:36,820 --> 02:51:37,340
Actually, I don't know.

5387
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:39,600
They'll lose two games, and we lose two games too.

5388
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:40,840
Yeah.

5389
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:42,580
I don't think we get a bye.

5390
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:43,400
I'm back, what happened?

5391
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:44,440
I don't think we get a bye, actually.

5392
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:45,700
Cause we lost to Shroud.

5393
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:47,400
Yeah, cause...

5394
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:47,720
Yeah.

5395
02:51:47,960 --> 02:51:48,680
Cause I think if...

5396
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:50,940
Even if Shroud loses that game...

5397
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:52,300
They beat us.

5398
02:51:52,520 --> 02:51:53,740
So they're technically like...

5399
02:51:53,740 --> 02:51:54,620
Yeah, they have the head-to-head.

5400
02:51:54,620 --> 02:51:55,420
So they beat 3-2.

5401
02:51:58,740 --> 02:51:59,100
Fuck.

5402
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:03,080
But they're struggling against Ten's team.

5403
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:04,180
So I think like...

5404
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:05,420
I think we just...

5405
02:52:05,420 --> 02:52:07,040
Really just had a bad banline against them.

5406
02:52:07,080 --> 02:52:07,460
It was our first game.

5407
02:52:07,580 --> 02:52:07,920
Yeah.

5408
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:08,540
Yeah, first game.

5409
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:09,080
Warm-up game.

5410
02:52:09,080 --> 02:52:09,520
Yeah.

5411
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:10,100
Yeah.

5412
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:15,220
Yeah.

5413
02:52:15,220 --> 02:52:15,360
Oh!

5414
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:19,300
This has been pretty intense.

5415
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:20,580
We don't know where I see it.

5416
02:52:21,060 --> 02:52:22,620
It's been so intense.

5417
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:23,880
What games are going on right now?

5418
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:24,900
Maybe I tap in.

5419
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:26,260
Shroud's team?

5420
02:52:26,860 --> 02:52:27,320
Um...

5421
02:52:28,100 --> 02:52:29,920
I don't know if any are going on.

5422
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:32,080
Shroud's team is still going on, so...

5423
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:32,880
Oh yeah, Shroud's playing.

5424
02:52:33,160 --> 02:52:33,680
Oh, okay.

5425
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:34,120
Yeah, yeah.

5426
02:52:36,620 --> 02:52:37,400
Shroud's team.

5427
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:40,400
Oh, I think everybody's just waiting for Shroud's team.

5428
02:52:41,640 --> 02:52:41,840
Yeah.

5429
02:52:42,860 --> 02:52:44,240
Looks like they're gonna win.

5430
02:52:45,020 --> 02:52:45,340
Yeah.

5431
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:45,860
Yeah, 99.

5432
02:52:46,640 --> 02:52:48,080
I wonder what made them struggle.

5433
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:50,060
Oh.

5434
02:52:50,060 --> 02:52:51,500
So is it bad if they win?

5435
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:53,720
Because then, like, with that instead of second?

5436
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:56,520
I think we're second no matter what.

5437
02:52:57,380 --> 02:52:57,820
No, we're third.

5438
02:52:58,020 --> 02:52:58,980
Or third no matter what, sorry.

5439
02:52:59,020 --> 02:52:59,860
We're third no matter what.

5440
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:00,620
Okay.

5441
02:53:00,620 --> 02:53:01,980
Wait, who do we fight if we're third?

5442
02:53:02,640 --> 02:53:03,660
We're in our seeding.

5443
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:06,560
Whoever would be the last team, I think.

5444
02:53:06,940 --> 02:53:07,200
Okay.

5445
02:53:08,340 --> 02:53:08,700
Yeah.

5446
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:10,760
Oh, because these two get buys.

5447
02:53:11,320 --> 02:53:11,500
Wait.

5448
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:12,480
Yeah, first and second get buys.

5449
02:53:12,740 --> 02:53:16,940
Okay, so the scariest part is that we might have to fight Nekros' team.

5450
02:53:17,640 --> 02:53:18,560
For their buy.

5451
02:53:19,700 --> 02:53:20,460
Wait, really?

5452
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:21,600
No, Nekros didn't win.

5453
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:22,480
I thought they won all their games.

5454
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:23,900
Wait, so, like, would it...

5455
02:53:23,900 --> 02:53:28,440
No, no, but, like, if we win against the last place team, do we fight Nekros' team or Shroud's team?

5456
02:53:28,780 --> 02:53:29,380
That's the thing.

5457
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:30,280
Oh, I don't need...

5458
02:53:30,660 --> 02:53:31,740
I think they would...

5459
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:33,920
Maybe they fight the lowest seed, so it wouldn't be...

5460
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:33,960
Yeah, yeah.

5461
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:34,440
I don't know.

5462
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:40,300
I would assume they would take the lowest seed remaining, but I'm not sure.

5463
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:44,040
Because it is one game, so, like, that's the scary part.

5464
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:46,780
Are we fighting Shroud's team or are we fighting Nekros' team?

5465
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:49,540
Well, I thought bracket play was best out of three, no?

5466
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:51,940
No, it's single elimination until finals.

5467
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:53,200
Gulp?

5468
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:53,260
Gulp?

5469
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:53,760
Yeah.

5470
02:53:54,580 --> 02:53:54,640
Yeah.

5471
02:53:55,560 --> 02:53:55,960
Gulp?

5472
02:53:57,620 --> 02:53:58,100
Gulp?

5473
02:53:58,100 --> 02:53:59,120
Gulp, bro.

5474
02:53:59,620 --> 02:53:59,940
Yep.

5475
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:03,260
It's not going to be domination.

5476
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:04,080
It's not, no.

5477
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:06,040
It's going to be the carts.

5478
02:54:06,680 --> 02:54:07,560
It's cart and point.

5479
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:09,260
Yeah.

5480
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:11,880
Either the payload, then cart, or full cart.

5481
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:17,760
It's all random, because they're like, we're not going to reveal the maps in case people are going to research the maps.

5482
02:54:18,820 --> 02:54:22,600
We're going to find out Andre live, like everybody else.

5483
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:33,320
So, I'm so sorry to be so slow.

5484
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:33,580
Okay.

5485
02:54:33,780 --> 02:54:35,760
So, if we lose from now on, we get eliminated.

5486
02:54:36,620 --> 02:54:38,920
So, what's the bottom that we can cut?

5487
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:39,320
Third.

5488
02:54:40,400 --> 02:54:41,340
No, we can get last place.

5489
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:42,540
We can get last place.

5490
02:54:43,480 --> 02:54:46,460
We can get last place, even though we've like...

5491
02:54:46,460 --> 02:54:48,540
Yes, because this determines our bracket.

5492
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:51,440
So, it determines who we're fighting next.

5493
02:54:52,240 --> 02:54:53,600
That's why we fight everybody.

5494
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:55,660
So, now we're like fighting better people.

5495
02:54:55,980 --> 02:54:58,600
No, we're like, we're actually, we're playing the real game now.

5496
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:00,060
We're playing the real tournament now.

5497
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:01,740
We're playing the same people who just played games.

5498
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:01,940
Yeah, yeah.

5499
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:04,460
Yeah, it'll be fine.

5500
02:55:04,980 --> 02:55:05,180
Yeah.

5501
02:55:05,860 --> 02:55:06,600
You did great.

5502
02:55:06,860 --> 02:55:07,340
It'll be easy.

5503
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:09,160
Zen mental.

5504
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:15,840
Oh, geez.

5505
02:55:16,300 --> 02:55:17,500
Yeah, it was just round robin.

5506
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:20,420
Do they have the records posted anywhere or no?

5507
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:21,980
I think it's going to be on XQC's stream.

5508
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:22,860
Yeah.

5509
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:23,820
Most likely.

5510
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:24,240
I have it.

5511
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:24,980
Yeah.

5512
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:26,260
Most likely.

5513
02:55:27,060 --> 02:55:27,240
Yeah.

5514
02:55:27,500 --> 02:55:27,620
Yep.

5515
02:55:28,320 --> 02:55:28,800
Yep.

5516
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:28,820
Okay.

5517
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:30,220
XQC was 1-4.

5518
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:33,020
Who did they 1 against?

5519
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:35,700
Wait, XQC won against Summit's team.

5520
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:43,360
One...

5521
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:43,960
Uh...

5522
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:43,980
Yeah.

5523
02:55:54,860 --> 02:55:57,100
I think we might fight XQC's team.

5524
02:56:00,450 --> 02:56:02,070
I think we might fight XQC's team.

5525
02:56:02,070 --> 02:56:02,130
I think we might fight XQC's team.

5526
02:56:03,170 --> 02:56:04,610
Because they went 1-5.

5527
02:56:06,470 --> 02:56:07,990
Didn't we have a hiccup against them?

5528
02:56:08,850 --> 02:56:10,090
We had a little hiccup, didn't we?

5529
02:56:10,190 --> 02:56:11,390
We lost the first round, I thought.

5530
02:56:12,950 --> 02:56:13,350
Uh...

5531
02:56:13,350 --> 02:56:14,050
No, we just...

5532
02:56:14,450 --> 02:56:14,630
We...

5533
02:56:14,630 --> 02:56:16,130
They were the ones on Jeff.

5534
02:56:17,590 --> 02:56:18,570
They have a Jeff player.

5535
02:56:18,770 --> 02:56:19,030
Oh, wait.

5536
02:56:19,910 --> 02:56:21,070
Oh, yeah.

5537
02:56:21,070 --> 02:56:21,350
I don't know.

5538
02:56:23,970 --> 02:56:24,770
Yeah, we went...

5539
02:56:24,770 --> 02:56:25,630
We went 2 rounds with them.

5540
02:56:25,830 --> 02:56:28,310
Yeah, they only won against Summit's team.

5541
02:56:32,130 --> 02:56:33,530
Which was like the first game.

5542
02:56:36,910 --> 02:56:37,870
I'm checking in.

5543
02:56:38,010 --> 02:56:38,870
Guys, is it...

5544
02:56:38,870 --> 02:56:39,250
Are we...

5545
02:56:39,250 --> 02:56:42,510
Okay, you guys are better at calculating stuff, because I'm not good at math.

5546
02:56:45,650 --> 02:56:47,650
And like looking at graphs.

5547
02:56:48,150 --> 02:56:49,190
So which team is the...

5548
02:56:49,190 --> 02:56:51,030
Because we're playing against 6th place team.

5549
02:56:51,290 --> 02:56:53,230
So which team is 6th place, guys?

5550
02:56:58,540 --> 02:56:59,660
Which team is...

5551
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:00,440
Is is...

5552
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:01,700
Is excuse me the 6th place team?

5553
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:03,360
Because we're...

5554
02:57:03,360 --> 02:57:04,680
We're fighting them, if they are.

5555
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:07,820
Back in literally 10th set.

5556
02:57:10,260 --> 02:57:10,740
Yeah?

5557
02:57:11,740 --> 02:57:12,500
There's six.

5558
02:57:12,640 --> 02:57:13,320
There's six teams.

5559
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:16,320
Oh sorry, he's 1-4.

5560
02:57:16,660 --> 02:57:17,160
Yeah, sorry.

5561
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:17,900
I can't count too.

5562
02:57:18,100 --> 02:57:18,740
I said one-5.

5563
02:57:24,540 --> 02:57:27,220
See, I told you I shouldn't be...

5564
02:57:27,220 --> 02:57:28,140
I can't count.

5565
02:57:28,440 --> 02:57:29,560
I told you.

5566
02:57:32,220 --> 02:57:34,640
Okay, so Shroud won that 10s.

5567
02:57:35,620 --> 02:57:36,420
Let's see.

5568
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,560
One, two, three.

5569
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:39,220
No, okay.

5570
02:57:39,900 --> 02:57:42,780
Both 10s and XQC only won one game.

5571
02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:49,920
So... Oh, but XQC lost to 10s.

5572
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:52,120
So, oh no, XQC is the last place team.

5573
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:52,360
Yeah.

5574
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:55,560
We're going to be... I think we're fighting XQC's team.

5575
02:57:56,780 --> 02:57:57,260
Okay.

5576
02:57:57,520 --> 02:58:02,340
Because XQC and 10s have a tiebreaker, but XQC, they both lost, won only one game.

5577
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:07,480
But XQC lost against 10s, so... Most likely we're playing against them.

5578
02:58:08,740 --> 02:58:09,460
This is good.

5579
02:58:09,540 --> 02:58:11,540
I feel really confident against that team.

5580
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:13,040
Yep, they're dog shit.

5581
02:58:14,220 --> 02:58:14,700
True.

5582
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:17,660
Oh, wait, wait.

5583
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:18,540
But then there's Summits.

5584
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:20,880
Wait, Summits team only won one game too.

5585
02:58:21,020 --> 02:58:21,560
Wait a minute.

5586
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:22,600
Yeah, that was a three-way tiebreaker.

5587
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:25,360
So, Summits beat 10s, so...

5588
02:58:26,040 --> 02:58:27,260
Oh, but it doesn't matter.

5589
02:58:27,500 --> 02:58:28,920
We're still fighting XQC's team.

5590
02:58:30,520 --> 02:58:31,800
It doesn't matter.

5591
02:58:32,100 --> 02:58:32,760
Let's go.

5592
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:37,160
But it's not going to be domination?

5593
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:37,980
No.

5594
02:58:38,720 --> 02:58:42,100
It's either the point, then cart, or cart, bro.

5595
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:44,940
But we don't know until they announce it.

5596
02:58:46,720 --> 02:58:47,080
Yeah.

5597
02:58:55,580 --> 02:58:56,880
Guys, thank God.

5598
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:02,300
I'm sorry to say this, but thank God XQC didn't first pick me.

5599
02:59:02,400 --> 02:59:04,160
Wait, how did you feel on Groot, though?

5600
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:04,800
Great.

5601
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:05,520
That's it, actually.

5602
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:06,460
Yeah, that was...

5603
02:59:06,460 --> 02:59:07,600
That might actually be a...

5604
02:59:09,560 --> 02:59:12,320
I could go against XQC's team, can't have Groot.

5605
02:59:14,100 --> 02:59:15,060
Yeah, yeah.

5606
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:16,900
We don't give XQC, Groot.

5607
02:59:16,900 --> 02:59:19,120
And he almost picked me up, guys.

5608
02:59:19,580 --> 02:59:20,180
Thank God.

5609
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:26,760
So, what happens if they ban Rocket, though?

5610
02:59:27,080 --> 02:59:27,540
Thank you, Summary.

5611
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:28,840
What's our contingency plan?

5612
02:59:29,740 --> 02:59:32,160
We put her on either Mantis or Cloak.

5613
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:34,880
Or are we doing Triple Tank?

5614
02:59:35,080 --> 02:59:38,640
Because, like, if we did Triple Tank, me and Bliss can both play main heal.

5615
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:43,900
So, maybe Triple Tank's a play.

5616
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:54,200
I know I would be infinitely better on the thing or Squirrel Girl than first timing, but then I don't know team comps or whatever you guys think is best.

5617
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:58,660
But just saying, I am really bad at first timing stuff, as you thought.

5618
02:59:59,220 --> 02:59:59,820
Yeah, it's fine.

5619
03:00:00,020 --> 03:00:01,380
I think Triple Tank's the play, then.

5620
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:03,900
Because then, like, I can...

5621
03:00:03,900 --> 03:00:07,900
Like, if Bliss and I both main heal, we'll just, like, pump so much heals into everybody.

5622
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:09,440
And it should be fine.

5623
03:00:10,180 --> 03:00:10,520
Yep.

5624
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:10,940
Yep.

5625
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:14,820
We'll have ult, like, on cooldown.

5626
03:00:15,100 --> 03:00:15,200
Yeah.

5627
03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:15,920
That would be amazing.

5628
03:00:16,240 --> 03:00:16,720
Exactly.

5629
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:26,400
Oh!

5630
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:27,660
Alright.

5631
03:00:30,200 --> 03:00:31,800
Now it's the real...

5632
03:00:32,460 --> 03:00:34,500
Real, real gameplay time.

5633
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:35,860
It's been fun, though.

5634
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:38,220
I've been having a lot of fun playing with this team.

5635
03:00:38,380 --> 03:00:40,060
It's pretty chill and everything.

5636
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:42,080
Uh...

5637
03:00:42,620 --> 03:00:44,540
And I'm just, like, like, hanging out.

5638
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:49,000
Yeah.

5639
03:00:49,700 --> 03:00:55,420
I think everybody has, like, one player that's, like, obviously, like, super new to the game.

5640
03:00:55,420 --> 03:00:56,680
So it really helps a lot.

5641
03:00:56,780 --> 03:00:57,440
I'm so happy.

5642
03:00:57,900 --> 03:00:59,200
I think, like...

5643
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:00,840
Okay, I'm glad I did practice.

5644
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:04,220
Because, like, I practiced out of fear that I had to play against StroudX.

5645
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:07,260
But I'm glad that StroudX were just, like...

5646
03:01:07,260 --> 03:01:09,980
The StroudX team was, like, the subs.

5647
03:01:10,220 --> 03:01:12,080
And I'm glad nobody dropped out.

5648
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:15,520
I'm glad...

5649
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:16,540
I'm glad...

5650
03:01:16,540 --> 03:01:17,120
I'm glad...

5651
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:18,900
I'm glad nobody had dropped out.

5652
03:01:19,080 --> 03:01:21,380
Because I would have been very scared.

5653
03:01:21,800 --> 03:01:22,180
I...

5654
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:24,320
Yeah.

5655
03:01:35,540 --> 03:01:37,060
I'm glad...

5656
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:41,920
I'm glad that I wasn't last pick.

5657
03:01:46,820 --> 03:01:49,120
It's the little things, you know?

5658
03:01:49,460 --> 03:01:53,380
It's the tiny things that bring me joy.

5659
03:01:56,730 --> 03:01:57,450
Oh, yeah.

5660
03:01:57,570 --> 03:01:58,730
I realized I could have.

5661
03:01:59,450 --> 03:02:00,870
I didn't even...

5662
03:02:00,870 --> 03:02:02,770
I forgot to use my...

5663
03:02:04,790 --> 03:02:06,370
I forgot to put this on.

5664
03:02:09,190 --> 03:02:11,190
Yeah, the teams are pretty balanced.

5665
03:02:11,190 --> 03:02:12,110
I feel like.

5666
03:02:12,390 --> 03:02:13,450
I mean, Nekros' team.

5667
03:02:13,550 --> 03:02:14,810
Nekros' team is scary.

5668
03:02:15,190 --> 03:02:16,570
He had, like, actual...

5669
03:02:16,570 --> 03:02:18,510
Like, he had really good picks.

5670
03:02:18,770 --> 03:02:19,370
In general.

5671
03:02:21,910 --> 03:02:22,510
Yeah.

5672
03:02:23,410 --> 03:02:25,170
Like, literally, he has...

5673
03:02:25,170 --> 03:02:27,230
His team is, like, really stacked.

5674
03:02:27,230 --> 03:02:27,910
In general.

5675
03:02:29,390 --> 03:02:30,190
Because he...

5676
03:02:30,190 --> 03:02:31,310
Noko is...

5677
03:02:31,310 --> 03:02:34,450
Basically, his team is, like, our team.

5678
03:02:34,990 --> 03:02:35,590
But...

5679
03:02:36,490 --> 03:02:37,750
His team is, like...

5680
03:02:37,750 --> 03:02:38,250
Our team.

5681
03:02:38,670 --> 03:02:40,370
With, like, three high rankers.

5682
03:02:40,670 --> 03:02:42,110
But then he also has Aspen.

5683
03:02:42,450 --> 03:02:46,670
Who, obviously, has really good game sense in hero shooters.

5684
03:02:47,270 --> 03:02:48,450
And, you know...

5685
03:02:49,490 --> 03:02:51,230
Has really good game sense in hero shooters.

5686
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:53,310
And it could transfer over to rivals.

5687
03:02:53,390 --> 03:02:54,550
And she does play rivals, too.

5688
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:55,590
So...

5689
03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:56,350
There's that.

5690
03:02:56,670 --> 03:02:57,890
But we don't really...

5691
03:02:57,890 --> 03:02:58,790
We have Tyler one.

5692
03:02:58,870 --> 03:02:59,330
I guess...

5693
03:02:59,910 --> 03:03:05,430
Aspen and Tyler are, like, the two people that are, like, closer regarding, like, skill level-wise.

5694
03:03:05,590 --> 03:03:12,410
Well, I think Aspen, obviously, on support and stuff, has high impact.

5695
03:03:12,630 --> 03:03:15,430
But the thing is, Necro's team has Guru, Necro's, and Noko.

5696
03:03:15,690 --> 03:03:19,190
Noko is an eternity player, but he's also in the same category as me.

5697
03:03:19,350 --> 03:03:24,570
So their trio is basically our trio, but instead of me on a tank, I am on a support.

5698
03:03:24,890 --> 03:03:30,150
So, like, Noko has much more value than me because they put him on Groot.

5699
03:03:30,270 --> 03:03:33,290
And Groot has so much value in a team.

5700
03:03:33,770 --> 03:03:39,250
Like, I had some crazy fucking plays as Loki, but, like, I can't kill, really.

5701
03:03:39,490 --> 03:03:44,670
I mean, I did kill, like, I could kill when I can, but, like, I'm spending too much time healing.

5702
03:03:52,250 --> 03:03:56,510
I have to, like, spend so much time healing.

5703
03:03:56,990 --> 03:04:00,670
So, yeah, they have, like, and they have, like, they basically have two really good tank players.

5704
03:04:01,810 --> 03:04:05,130
They have two incredibly good tank players in general.

5705
03:04:05,130 --> 03:04:07,430
So, that's really scary.

5706
03:04:11,570 --> 03:04:13,490
But now we have Tyler1 on Groot.

5707
03:04:13,570 --> 03:04:14,190
I believe.

5708
03:04:16,490 --> 03:04:17,290
I believe.

5709
03:04:23,550 --> 03:04:25,670
Sometimes I'm worried I'm, like, spamming too much.

5710
03:04:25,810 --> 03:04:33,850
I'm trying to give simpler comms because I think Gale is very, definitely, like, Gale is very used to giving, like, high elo comms.

5711
03:04:33,970 --> 03:04:37,170
So, I'm trying to, like, dumb it down for people.

5712
03:04:41,590 --> 03:04:42,070
Yeah.

5713
03:04:49,170 --> 03:04:52,390
No, his, his Groot is really, his Groot is actually really good.

5714
03:04:52,570 --> 03:04:54,630
Like, he had really, really good ults.

5715
03:04:58,580 --> 03:04:59,440
Like, honestly.

5716
03:05:01,480 --> 03:05:03,660
Is everyone just watching XQC streams?

5717
03:05:04,340 --> 03:05:06,340
I have to see what he's talking about.

5718
03:05:06,380 --> 03:05:08,000
Okay, what is he talking about right now?

5719
03:05:13,820 --> 03:05:14,580
Oh, my God.

5720
03:05:15,560 --> 03:05:17,300
Oh, it's because they're interviewing him.

5721
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:19,120
All right, guys.

5722
03:05:19,260 --> 03:05:20,060
You can listen to him.

5723
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:21,280
You guys want to listen to him?

5724
03:05:21,900 --> 03:05:23,740
Yoink my content, too.

5725
03:05:25,820 --> 03:05:26,560
Wait, okay.

5726
03:05:26,820 --> 03:05:27,140
Wait, okay.

5727
03:05:28,640 --> 03:05:30,780
That's because I can't, I can do the thing by myself.

5728
03:05:32,360 --> 03:05:33,920
I'm doing the best as I can.

5729
03:05:34,560 --> 03:05:37,520
And sometimes with the, uh, I don't know if you guys can hear him.

5730
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:40,120
With the Z combo with Raccoon, we're just getting one tap.

5731
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:44,360
But, um, next, next game, I think.

5732
03:05:44,740 --> 03:05:45,960
Next game, chat.

5733
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:46,740
Just watch.

5734
03:05:48,180 --> 03:05:49,560
Next game, we're against him.

5735
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:52,580
on the team and you're going to see cinema.

5736
03:05:53,260 --> 03:05:54,600
We're going to be against him.

5737
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:55,260
It's all I'm going to say.

5738
03:05:56,760 --> 03:05:57,040
anyway.

5739
03:05:58,420 --> 03:06:08,160
Also, chat, even if, let's say, I'm knocked out, it doesn't matter that much because we're going to, um, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to catch Rolly a little bit.

5740
03:06:08,280 --> 03:06:10,420
I'm going to go with him in a catcher booth and catch a little bit.

5741
03:06:10,620 --> 03:06:12,000
What language is that?

5742
03:06:12,140 --> 03:06:12,360
Quebecois.

5743
03:06:12,360 --> 03:06:13,600
It's not me, it's probably going to be Ico, let's be honest.

5744
03:06:13,820 --> 03:06:14,480
Quebec English.

5745
03:06:15,540 --> 03:06:26,600
I won't lie, a lot of people who live in, are Quebecois people, actually, in English, they talk very similar in terms of like, and they're like, that's, uh, no, I'm not joking.

5746
03:06:26,900 --> 03:06:29,060
I can tell when somebody's from Quebec.

5747
03:06:31,660 --> 03:06:32,760
I can tell.

5748
03:06:33,460 --> 03:06:35,580
Because they sound very similar to XTC.

5749
03:06:39,730 --> 03:06:43,130
I'm not doing cloak and dagger, but, well, I'm I muted.

5750
03:06:44,530 --> 03:06:45,290
No, I should be fine.

5751
03:06:46,370 --> 03:06:47,850
Plus 250k, the necros.

5752
03:06:49,890 --> 03:06:52,530
Oh, yeah, because, uh, it's brushing care was talking to me.

5753
03:06:53,630 --> 03:06:54,390
It's all good, it's all good.

5754
03:06:55,870 --> 03:06:57,690
Um, what else, what else, what else, what else, what else?

5755
03:06:59,690 --> 03:07:00,370
He's Canadian.

5756
03:07:00,370 --> 03:07:04,190
Do you guys know where the, uh, the seating is at?

5757
03:07:04,330 --> 03:07:05,930
So I can see the, who's winning and losing?

5758
03:07:10,250 --> 03:07:10,570
Um,

5759
03:07:16,500 --> 03:07:16,980
oh, no, you're good.

5760
03:07:17,640 --> 03:07:18,480
I think we're, what, one and four?

5761
03:07:19,660 --> 03:07:21,660
I would probably make, we could make it come back to that.

5762
03:07:21,860 --> 03:07:22,380
I think they were chilling.

5763
03:07:23,880 --> 03:07:24,140
Yo.

5764
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:24,900
Bro.

5765
03:07:26,920 --> 03:07:33,120
I think it's funny that we're against XTC, because we have, what the hell's going on?

5766
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:33,720
We're getting iced.

5767
03:07:34,360 --> 03:07:34,720
The fuck?

5768
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:36,980
You guys can hear them, right?

5769
03:07:37,320 --> 03:07:38,600
Yeah, I have a stream up and I'm just waiting.

5770
03:07:38,760 --> 03:07:39,060
They're seating.

5771
03:07:39,380 --> 03:07:40,720
Yeah, they're still deciding the seating.

5772
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:42,960
Oh, my lord.

5773
03:07:43,460 --> 03:07:45,920
I think it's because of all the tiebreakers, but like, yeah.

5774
03:07:47,160 --> 03:07:48,240
Uh, today you're the best.

5775
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:48,900
Thumbs up.

5776
03:07:49,160 --> 03:07:56,880
I think it's funny that we're against XTC's team, because we have Bliss and Tyler won, and XTC's team has like, you know, Bliss's boyfriend,

5777
03:08:04,520 --> 03:08:06,080
I think that's pretty funny.

5778
03:08:07,380 --> 03:08:09,160
That like, that's where it is.

5779
03:08:12,580 --> 03:08:16,540
I wonder how they're, how they've been playing, how XTC's been playing.

5780
03:08:17,800 --> 03:08:18,900
Is it like, Joe?

5781
03:08:19,220 --> 03:08:19,820
What they've been playing?

5782
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:24,420
Okay, I'm just looking at this.

5783
03:08:24,620 --> 03:08:24,740
Okay.

5784
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:27,460
I've been playing Jeff.

5785
03:08:28,480 --> 03:08:29,040
Okay.

5786
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:30,780
Mostly Jeff.

5787
03:08:31,020 --> 03:08:31,200
Okay.

5788
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:33,660
Alright.

5789
03:08:36,910 --> 03:08:38,730
I've been playing mostly Jeff.

5790
03:08:38,950 --> 03:08:40,150
It doesn't seem like anything else.

5791
03:08:41,590 --> 03:08:42,330
Jeff.

5792
03:08:43,070 --> 03:08:43,710
Jeff.

5793
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:48,250
Uh, wait, was Erob last pick?

5794
03:08:48,530 --> 03:08:48,730
Oh.

5795
03:08:50,190 --> 03:08:50,930
Unfortunate.

5796
03:08:50,930 --> 03:08:53,390
Oh wait, but they had him on Starlord.

5797
03:08:54,350 --> 03:08:55,090
Triple sup.

5798
03:08:55,470 --> 03:08:58,370
Oh my gosh, it's like, I don't know, it's like everywhere.

5799
03:08:58,910 --> 03:09:01,050
Oh, that's like the closest they've ever got.

5800
03:09:01,910 --> 03:09:04,330
When they went triple sup, was the closest.

5801
03:09:05,850 --> 03:09:08,810
They didn't go mantis, they went double mania.

5802
03:09:11,150 --> 03:09:12,150
You just learned that?

5803
03:09:12,250 --> 03:09:13,570
Yeah, no, Tyler and Erob are brothers.

5804
03:09:17,230 --> 03:09:18,110
I'm pretty sure.

5805
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:24,080
and Necro's have buys, right?

5806
03:09:25,100 --> 03:09:25,280
Oh.

5807
03:09:26,140 --> 03:09:27,020
They should, yeah.

5808
03:09:27,260 --> 03:09:32,920
What we're trying to figure out, right, is the seedings from third through six because that kind of decides what the matchups look like.

5809
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:37,400
We kind of know you guys and think probably succeed here, but it's like three and four that we're not sure about.

5810
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:43,100
Obviously, they're in different games, so they have to check like rounds one and like who those rounds got scored against.

5811
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:47,080
Oh, so three and four.

5812
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:49,520
So no matter what, we play against XTC.

5813
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:51,280
How you feeling, bro?

5814
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:53,260
Look, you guys had a good start.

5815
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:53,800
We are the bro.

5816
03:09:53,940 --> 03:09:54,400
Good start.

5817
03:09:54,500 --> 03:09:55,120
It's all good.

5818
03:09:55,380 --> 03:09:56,760
Yeah, we're a little bit defeated, a little bit defeated.

5819
03:09:56,980 --> 03:10:11,400
We have a little problems with our team, but we're trying to fix it on the fly, you know, because we didn't really know our strengths and our weaknesses, you know, so like, we have to kind of navigate around those flaws and try to find a winning combo because,

5820
03:10:13,240 --> 03:10:17,220
like, with our character pool, we don't really have a full team.

5821
03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:17,980
Does that make sense?

5822
03:10:18,340 --> 03:10:18,360
Yeah.

5823
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:28,820
I think you were talking about not having the Punisher with like the Rocket and that is something we definitely realized where like the other teams like it just, you just get like one...

5824
03:10:28,820 --> 03:10:30,700
I don't know what he's saying.

5825
03:10:30,980 --> 03:10:36,820
I think it's because like I've known XQC for so long, I can understand.

5826
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:49,680
Yeah, even Tenz like he was just like literally holding left click just the whole time and it doesn't matter who you put behind that gun when you have a Raccoon Z, I mean, you're doing like one million damage a second.

5827
03:10:49,980 --> 03:10:50,800
It is what it is.

5828
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:52,360
Like, it's...

5829
03:10:52,360 --> 03:10:57,320
you can try to do like other types of damage to flank or whatever, but it comes up to like just pure outputs.

5830
03:10:57,720 --> 03:11:02,840
I mean, if we're playing linear sightlines, I mean, we're losing the output game 100%.

5831
03:11:02,840 --> 03:11:04,520
So, I think it's what we need to figure out.

5832
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:06,640
to the untrained ear.

5833
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:07,740
It's just...

5834
03:11:07,740 --> 03:11:10,060
I like how he's drinking Red Bull right now, too.

5835
03:11:11,800 --> 03:11:13,240
That doesn't really help.

5836
03:11:16,380 --> 03:11:20,760
On the side, it's like, remember to drink your Red Bull for your Red Bull sponsor.

5837
03:11:28,720 --> 03:11:32,680
when people run like triple heals or like heavy damage, we just fall apart.

5838
03:11:32,840 --> 03:11:39,660
And then the, the Jeff is, I mean, you need a lot of experience for Jeff to do damage and be disruptive and stay alive.

5839
03:11:39,980 --> 03:11:42,420
And it's not, we don't have much experience on that.

5840
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:47,380
So, we went off of it because we're having problems like getting value off of that.

5841
03:11:47,660 --> 03:11:47,880
Right?

5842
03:11:48,880 --> 03:11:50,820
But some of the teams are looking pretty strong though.

5843
03:11:51,220 --> 03:11:53,480
Okay, so they're not playing Jeff anymore.

5844
03:11:53,480 --> 03:11:54,020
They're doing pretty good.

5845
03:11:55,680 --> 03:12:00,100
I was even impressed by Dean's, Dean and Dean and was it Dean's and Ten's DPS combo?

5846
03:12:00,300 --> 03:12:03,000
Yeah, Dean was on the Squirrel Girl, I think, against you guys.

5847
03:12:03,460 --> 03:12:04,580
Yeah, we were getting rolled.

5848
03:12:06,920 --> 03:12:12,220
When we saw them play against you guys, I was like, man, I was like, what was the scores with them against other teams, right?

5849
03:12:12,340 --> 03:12:13,680
Because they were pretty good.

5850
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:16,620
Like, they looked like as good as some of the other teams you guys played.

5851
03:12:16,780 --> 03:12:19,880
The Human Torch, it feels like in everybody's hands.

5852
03:12:19,980 --> 03:12:24,360
I mean, that hero is crazy, it's pretty awful to play against Stumdogg online.

5853
03:12:24,520 --> 03:12:25,440
It's like, you're just taking damage.

5854
03:12:25,820 --> 03:12:26,780
Oh, they're doing the seeding.

5855
03:12:26,980 --> 03:12:30,880
The entire game by some flying, like, it reminds me of Fairmercy.

5856
03:12:30,960 --> 03:12:31,920
We will have...

5857
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:32,480
Oh!

5858
03:12:34,140 --> 03:12:35,480
Oh, we don't play right away.

5859
03:12:35,760 --> 03:12:36,680
They do it one by one.

5860
03:12:38,280 --> 03:12:39,740
Oh, so we have to walk...

5861
03:12:39,820 --> 03:12:41,900
because they're doing Ten's versus Summit first.

5862
03:12:42,100 --> 03:12:42,700
That's what it says.

5863
03:12:43,300 --> 03:12:45,080
Yeah, I just saw Necro's and Shred of a bye.

5864
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:47,800
Up first is Ten's versus Summit, then Super versus XQC.

5865
03:12:48,260 --> 03:12:48,620
Yeah.

5866
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:50,240
So we're just chilling.

5867
03:12:50,860 --> 03:12:51,960
It's actually disturbing.

5868
03:12:53,340 --> 03:12:55,060
We gotta watch them.

5869
03:12:56,200 --> 03:12:56,680
Yeah.

5870
03:12:57,520 --> 03:12:58,360
All good.

5871
03:12:58,560 --> 03:12:58,800
All good.

5872
03:12:58,980 --> 03:13:00,620
This is my time to plan, I guess.

5873
03:13:01,680 --> 03:13:01,940
Oh my god.

5874
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:03,200
I can earn my...

5875
03:13:03,200 --> 03:13:04,780
Balotro during this first game or something.

5876
03:13:05,140 --> 03:13:06,360
Boot up some bloons.

5877
03:13:08,380 --> 03:13:09,860
Just like the good old days.

5878
03:13:14,710 --> 03:13:15,390
All right.

5879
03:13:16,570 --> 03:13:17,530
I could...

5880
03:13:17,530 --> 03:13:19,190
I could get my Wolverine.

5881
03:13:19,570 --> 03:13:21,490
Wait, actually, does custom game count?

5882
03:13:22,530 --> 03:13:23,170
It does!

5883
03:13:23,670 --> 03:13:25,970
Oh, wait, no, it's because I lost several quick play games.

5884
03:13:26,110 --> 03:13:26,730
Okay, no, it doesn't.

5885
03:13:29,890 --> 03:13:31,190
All right, what did I get?

5886
03:13:31,910 --> 03:13:33,250
Oh my god, wait, I got it?

5887
03:13:33,310 --> 03:13:34,770
Oh, wait, no, it's the emote.

5888
03:13:34,950 --> 03:13:36,070
God damn, I saw it.

5889
03:13:36,150 --> 03:13:37,770
I was like, oh my god, I did it.

5890
03:13:38,590 --> 03:13:40,510
Okay, I have to wait for phase two.

5891
03:13:40,670 --> 03:13:43,230
I need to wait 10 fucking hours.

5892
03:13:43,530 --> 03:13:43,790
Okay.

5893
03:13:44,930 --> 03:13:45,890
Yeah, I don't have it.

5894
03:13:45,970 --> 03:13:46,730
I don't have any.

5895
03:13:48,170 --> 03:13:49,670
hi from production again.

5896
03:13:50,330 --> 03:13:57,730
Just did you guys, congratulations, you finished in third, so you're going to be up against XPC's team in the first round here.

5897
03:13:58,430 --> 03:13:58,730
Nice.

5898
03:13:58,730 --> 03:14:09,570
Then there's a single elimination this round, but no doubt you guys are going to crush, so after the summings, you'll be playing against one of the people with a bye, which is Troud and Nekros.

5899
03:14:10,670 --> 03:14:11,690
But good luck.

5900
03:14:11,870 --> 03:14:13,010
You guys are going to go second.

5901
03:14:13,890 --> 03:14:19,830
The average run time on these games is about 15 minutes, so you have about 15 minutes to go live your lives however you want.

5902
03:14:20,050 --> 03:14:20,770
I like how...

5903
03:14:20,770 --> 03:14:22,230
We'll see you soon, but good luck.

5904
03:14:22,470 --> 03:14:22,630
Cool.

5905
03:14:22,870 --> 03:14:23,270
Cool.

5906
03:14:23,370 --> 03:14:23,990
Sounds good.

5907
03:14:24,230 --> 03:14:26,370
I like how they're like, you're going to win, obviously.

5908
03:14:26,610 --> 03:14:26,950
Thank you.

5909
03:14:28,110 --> 03:14:29,630
Oh, he's trying to jinx our ass.

5910
03:14:29,710 --> 03:14:30,110
The fuck?

5911
03:14:31,670 --> 03:14:32,870
He's trying to jinx us.

5912
03:14:32,870 --> 03:14:33,430
Wait.

5913
03:14:35,430 --> 03:14:35,750
Who's...

5914
03:14:36,410 --> 03:14:37,410
Who's this person?

5915
03:14:38,790 --> 03:14:40,830
Oh, one thing I forgot to say, there's...

5916
03:14:43,650 --> 03:14:45,710
There's absolutely no way you can lose super.

5917
03:14:46,330 --> 03:14:46,650
Oh.

5918
03:14:47,090 --> 03:14:47,930
Okay, just checking.

5919
03:14:48,270 --> 03:14:50,210
Yeah, I mean, I was thinking you're trying to like jinx us.

5920
03:14:50,310 --> 03:14:52,510
You're trying to say we got this shit in the bag, but then like...

5921
03:14:53,670 --> 03:14:55,530
I heard you say that after I left, so I had to come back.

5922
03:14:55,530 --> 03:14:57,810
Yeah, dude, like, you never fucking know, man.

5923
03:14:59,790 --> 03:15:00,630
Oh, Jesus.

5924
03:15:01,270 --> 03:15:02,770
They got the bug in my room.

5925
03:15:02,870 --> 03:15:05,670
They're not playing Jeff anymore, XQC's team.

5926
03:15:06,290 --> 03:15:07,730
So, we don't have to worry about that.

5927
03:15:08,010 --> 03:15:10,230
They try to do triple support, so...

5928
03:15:10,670 --> 03:15:12,550
I mean, honestly, I don't think Jeff was a worry to begin with.

5929
03:15:12,970 --> 03:15:13,110
I know.

5930
03:15:13,390 --> 03:15:14,510
I was kind of hoping they play Jeff again.

5931
03:15:14,870 --> 03:15:20,970
Yeah, like, it wasn't working for them, so they got off Jeff, so they're like experimenting on comps now.

5932
03:15:23,930 --> 03:15:26,590
Oh, I'm going to use the bathroom chat.

5933
03:15:26,710 --> 03:15:27,070
I'll be back.

5934
03:15:27,970 --> 03:15:33,270
So, 10s in Summit, and Super...

5935
03:15:33,270 --> 03:15:34,030
Oh, yeah.

5936
03:15:34,190 --> 03:15:49,290
So, 10s in Summit will go first, then it's us, Super against XQC, and then, uh, whoever wins in the 10s versus Summit will go against Necros, and whoever wins that one will go against if we win against Shroud, but if we lose against Shroud, we're out.

5937
03:15:50,190 --> 03:15:50,410
Okay.

5938
03:15:50,810 --> 03:15:52,470
But we're not going to lose, so...

5939
03:15:52,470 --> 03:15:52,750
No.

5940
03:15:52,930 --> 03:15:53,490
We got this.

5941
03:15:53,710 --> 03:15:54,550
We go all the way.

5942
03:15:55,070 --> 03:16:02,110
If we do lose to Shroud, though, we are guaranteed third place if we beat XQC's team.

5943
03:16:03,610 --> 03:16:04,290
I believe.

5944
03:16:04,290 --> 03:16:04,810
I think.

5945
03:16:05,250 --> 03:16:06,090
That's how that works.

5946
03:16:06,530 --> 03:16:06,630
Hmm.

5947
03:16:07,390 --> 03:16:08,230
Looking into this.

5948
03:16:08,530 --> 03:16:08,990
Or wait.

5949
03:16:09,370 --> 03:16:10,190
Uh, no, wait.

5950
03:16:10,230 --> 03:16:10,730
We'll be...

5951
03:16:10,730 --> 03:16:12,070
We'll be fourth.

5952
03:16:12,250 --> 03:16:12,430
Sorry.

5953
03:16:13,870 --> 03:16:14,530
We'll be fourth.

5954
03:16:15,730 --> 03:16:18,910
Do you guys think it's worth me trying to let in Kluke in 15 minutes?

5955
03:16:19,250 --> 03:16:22,430
I mean, you could go to the practice range and, like, mess around with your abilities and stuff.

5956
03:16:22,630 --> 03:16:23,250
It could be worth.

5957
03:16:23,510 --> 03:16:23,910
Yeah.

5958
03:16:23,910 --> 03:16:24,230
Yeah.

5959
03:16:24,450 --> 03:16:25,610
I'm just in the practice range now.

5960
03:16:25,870 --> 03:16:27,090
Has anyone given me advice?

5961
03:16:27,390 --> 03:16:28,490
I have, like, no...

5962
03:16:30,250 --> 03:16:30,650
Um...

5963
03:16:30,650 --> 03:16:30,890
Here.

5964
03:16:31,150 --> 03:16:31,450
Okay.

5965
03:16:31,590 --> 03:16:38,070
So, if you want to use your E on dagger, that increases the healing that you give to everyone else.

5966
03:16:38,270 --> 03:16:42,890
And then, if you want to throw your right click, like, on top of them after that, that's, like, a lot of healing.

5967
03:16:43,550 --> 03:16:43,890
Mm-hmm.

5968
03:16:46,430 --> 03:16:46,830
Um...

5969
03:16:46,830 --> 03:16:50,250
So, so, I like, like, into, like, into just the team.

5970
03:16:50,730 --> 03:16:50,970
Yeah.

5971
03:16:51,010 --> 03:16:52,350
Into the tanks or whoever's in front of you.

5972
03:16:52,450 --> 03:16:52,590
Yeah.

5973
03:16:53,310 --> 03:16:53,870
Yeah.

5974
03:16:53,990 --> 03:16:54,130
Yeah, yeah.

5975
03:16:54,570 --> 03:16:59,950
And then, your cloak form, your E on cloak is, like, a...

5976
03:17:00,530 --> 03:17:04,610
It basically makes everyone who gets hit by it on the other team take more damage.

5977
03:17:06,050 --> 03:17:06,670
Uh-huh.

5978
03:17:06,870 --> 03:17:07,070
Okay.

5979
03:17:07,610 --> 03:17:11,330
So, so cloak is, like, damage and then, and then, like, non-cloak is, like, healing.

5980
03:17:11,670 --> 03:17:12,790
Yeah, dagger's the healing.

5981
03:17:12,910 --> 03:17:13,130
Yeah, yeah.

5982
03:17:13,270 --> 03:17:18,270
Yeah, I mean, you have time to go on quick play right now to, like, try her out and get, see her kit.

5983
03:17:19,710 --> 03:17:20,410
Okay, okay.

5984
03:17:20,730 --> 03:17:23,550
Yeah, because, like, we have to wait, like, entire, like, game for her.

5985
03:17:23,670 --> 03:17:32,310
I really like, listen, I really like that we're not going to be on domination because I feel like our team's really going to excel and payload.

5986
03:17:33,850 --> 03:17:34,610
You think so?

5987
03:17:35,170 --> 03:17:36,390
Yeah, I really do.

5988
03:17:37,470 --> 03:17:46,350
Because, like, against teams like, uh, like, necros and stuff, like, I feel their comp works so much better, like, what they were playing on top.

5989
03:17:46,350 --> 03:17:48,370
I mean, yeah, dive is so good on domination.

5990
03:17:48,890 --> 03:17:49,590
Yeah, right?

5991
03:17:49,810 --> 03:17:52,550
So, it's like, I think we'll do a lot better, personally.

5992
03:17:53,090 --> 03:17:53,630
Mm-hmm.

5993
03:17:56,890 --> 03:17:57,850
You got this for sure.

5994
03:18:06,450 --> 03:18:08,750
Wait, is Lydia in practice range or in rank?

5995
03:18:08,910 --> 03:18:09,670
Or, not rank.

5996
03:18:10,470 --> 03:18:11,310
In quick play.

5997
03:18:11,570 --> 03:18:15,610
I think if she was on quick play and just get used to her kit, it would help a lot.

5998
03:18:17,710 --> 03:18:19,810
Oh, this shit's going to take forever.

5999
03:18:23,230 --> 03:18:23,590
Yeah.

6000
03:18:24,010 --> 03:18:25,750
It'll be a little bit, but it's not too, too bad.

6001
03:18:27,670 --> 03:18:29,370
I'm about to fall about to take a nap, bro.

6002
03:18:31,070 --> 03:18:34,470
I have a daughter, by the way, that I'm neglecting to play this piece of shit.

6003
03:18:35,550 --> 03:18:36,750
I'm serious, by the way.

6004
03:18:38,290 --> 03:18:40,630
they said it'll be 5.5 hours.

6005
03:18:41,210 --> 03:18:42,330
Oh, fuck this.

6006
03:18:42,850 --> 03:18:44,930
He didn't pay me shit to play in this tournament.

6007
03:18:48,490 --> 03:18:51,570
But think about, could have my fucking heart and he's making me waste my time.

6008
03:18:51,910 --> 03:18:52,490
I'm getting pissed, guys.

6009
03:18:53,050 --> 03:18:56,550
I mean, hey, if we get first, if we get first, we get 20k for...

6010
03:18:56,550 --> 03:18:58,870
Yeah, think about your kids' college fun.

6011
03:18:59,230 --> 03:19:02,130
Yeah, think about that.

6012
03:19:02,130 --> 03:19:03,030
Hey, college.

6013
03:19:03,150 --> 03:19:04,330
That shit's fucking a scam.

6014
03:19:06,530 --> 03:19:08,310
This shit's a scam as fuck, by the way.

6015
03:19:09,930 --> 03:19:10,890
Oh, they're starting.

6016
03:19:11,150 --> 03:19:11,690
Oh, thank God.

6017
03:19:12,370 --> 03:19:13,630
Oh, wait.

6018
03:19:13,710 --> 03:19:14,550
The rules are wrong.

6019
03:19:14,770 --> 03:19:15,470
They're re...

6020
03:19:15,470 --> 03:19:18,070
Oh, my fucking God.

6021
03:19:18,070 --> 03:19:18,730
Wait, what?

6022
03:19:18,950 --> 03:19:19,330
They already do.

6023
03:19:21,490 --> 03:19:22,770
Oh, my God.

6024
03:19:28,230 --> 03:19:33,290
Oh, yeah, Lily, if you can, you can try out Cloak's kit during quick play if you're doing it.

6025
03:19:33,310 --> 03:19:35,590
Yeah, so I'm just going into a quick play game now.

6026
03:19:35,590 --> 03:19:36,330
I'm just...

6027
03:19:36,970 --> 03:19:38,310
I'm trying my best.

6028
03:19:38,490 --> 03:19:41,230
Okay, so do you think that I should, like...

6029
03:19:41,230 --> 03:19:47,630
Do you think that I should go into Cloak often or do you think I should mainly just stay as the healing one?

6030
03:19:47,870 --> 03:19:48,950
Stay as the healing one.

6031
03:19:49,090 --> 03:19:49,610
You only...

6032
03:19:49,610 --> 03:19:52,630
Honestly, for you, you just go to Cloak when you ult.

6033
03:19:52,910 --> 03:19:57,190
After your ult, you just go in Cloak and stay in your ult and then left click people for damage.

6034
03:19:58,130 --> 03:19:59,930
Because, like, if you're on...

6035
03:20:00,710 --> 03:20:04,270
If you're on your dagger after your ult, it just does nothing, really.

6036
03:20:06,690 --> 03:20:07,430
Okay, okay.

6037
03:20:08,150 --> 03:20:09,230
So just stay on...

6038
03:20:09,230 --> 03:20:10,470
Just stay on Cloak.

6039
03:20:10,610 --> 03:20:11,950
Just stay on dagger throughout it.

6040
03:20:12,010 --> 03:20:14,550
Wait for their game to finish first, Tyler.

6041
03:20:14,690 --> 03:20:15,570
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6042
03:20:15,770 --> 03:20:16,890
They're not coin flipping?

6043
03:20:17,070 --> 03:20:17,830
They're actually playing it out?

6044
03:20:20,230 --> 03:20:21,730
No, they haven't even played their game yet.

6045
03:20:22,370 --> 03:20:22,930
Wait, wait, wait.

6046
03:20:22,930 --> 03:20:23,050
Okay.

6047
03:20:23,370 --> 03:20:24,410
Are they on the other side of the bracket?

6048
03:20:25,030 --> 03:20:25,330
Yeah.

6049
03:20:26,010 --> 03:20:26,170
Yeah.

6050
03:20:26,510 --> 03:20:28,110
Oh, so they're going one at a time now.

6051
03:20:28,170 --> 03:20:28,770
One at a time.

6052
03:20:29,050 --> 03:20:30,190
Oh, my fucking God.

6053
03:20:30,430 --> 03:20:31,470
We've got to wait for their game.

6054
03:20:31,610 --> 03:20:36,550
And then when their game ends, then we'll go against XUC's team, which we should win.

6055
03:20:36,850 --> 03:20:37,330
Yeah.

6056
03:20:37,610 --> 03:20:38,250
We really should.

6057
03:20:38,870 --> 03:20:40,230
We're top four, right?

6058
03:20:40,610 --> 03:20:43,550
Yeah, that'll put us top four, which puts us in guaranteed 25k.

6059
03:20:43,550 --> 03:20:43,850
Shroud.

6060
03:20:45,210 --> 03:20:45,310
Yep.

6061
03:20:45,790 --> 03:20:47,810
So third and fourth is guaranteed 25k.

6062
03:20:49,350 --> 03:20:50,770
So that was split between everyone.

6063
03:20:50,770 --> 03:20:52,030
That's like 4k per person.

6064
03:20:52,990 --> 03:20:57,730
Guys, do you guys want to play a game?

6065
03:20:58,210 --> 03:20:59,210
Oh, I'm so down.

6066
03:20:59,530 --> 03:21:02,390
Who wants to coin flip for their winnings?

6067
03:21:03,910 --> 03:21:04,350
Super?

6068
03:21:04,850 --> 03:21:05,290
Super?

6069
03:21:05,530 --> 03:21:06,470
Let's flip a coin.

6070
03:21:06,650 --> 03:21:08,890
If it's heads, I get your winnings.

6071
03:21:08,930 --> 03:21:10,050
If it's tails, you get mine.

6072
03:21:10,330 --> 03:21:10,790
Let's do that.

6073
03:21:11,010 --> 03:21:11,710
Come on, bro.

6074
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:13,090
Those are the odds I'll take.

6075
03:21:13,090 --> 03:21:14,330
I'll take those odds.

6076
03:21:14,830 --> 03:21:16,090
Damn, that's crazy.

6077
03:21:17,810 --> 03:21:19,170
I'm going to put it at 50-50.

6078
03:21:19,550 --> 03:21:22,230
Okay, but then if I lose, I'm just jumping off the map repeat.

6079
03:21:22,250 --> 03:21:24,210
At least so you get as little money as possible.

6080
03:21:26,570 --> 03:21:29,030
I'll run it down so you get as little money as possible.

6081
03:21:29,150 --> 03:21:29,510
Damn!

6082
03:21:31,970 --> 03:21:33,450
We'll do it after, then.

6083
03:21:33,690 --> 03:21:33,870
After.

6084
03:21:35,710 --> 03:21:36,810
I'll look into this.

6085
03:21:37,390 --> 03:21:37,870
After the game.

6086
03:21:45,340 --> 03:21:45,780
Alright.

6087
03:21:46,580 --> 03:21:48,060
I'm just putting it on.

6088
03:21:48,960 --> 03:21:49,960
Let's go gambling.

6089
03:22:02,170 --> 03:22:03,190
I'm just waiting.

6090
03:22:03,430 --> 03:22:04,210
Honestly, guys.

6091
03:22:04,410 --> 03:22:04,850
Just chilling.

6092
03:22:06,070 --> 03:22:07,870
Wait, they super got evicted?

6093
03:22:08,250 --> 03:22:09,230
How did he get evicted?

6094
03:22:09,410 --> 03:22:10,970
Is that a sensitive topic for him?

6095
03:22:11,550 --> 03:22:12,170
Is that...

6096
03:22:13,010 --> 03:22:14,510
Can I even ask that?

6097
03:22:16,230 --> 03:22:18,250
I don't watch the matches, too, though.

6098
03:22:22,810 --> 03:22:25,270
Is it a sensitive topic?

6099
03:22:25,870 --> 03:22:27,390
I'm looking at the mainstream.

6100
03:22:32,050 --> 03:22:32,610
Nice.

6101
03:22:32,850 --> 03:22:33,170
They're starting.

6102
03:22:33,410 --> 03:22:33,530
Yep.

6103
03:22:38,250 --> 03:22:39,130
It's not...

6104
03:22:39,130 --> 03:22:39,490
Wait.

6105
03:22:39,670 --> 03:22:41,050
My chat said you got evicted.

6106
03:22:43,750 --> 03:22:44,470
That's super.

6107
03:22:44,970 --> 03:22:45,690
What happened?

6108
03:22:46,410 --> 03:22:46,830
What happened?

6109
03:22:46,990 --> 03:22:47,270
What's going on?

6110
03:22:47,470 --> 03:22:48,430
Super, you got evicted?

6111
03:22:48,790 --> 03:22:49,590
What did you do?

6112
03:22:50,010 --> 03:22:51,310
I did not get evicted.

6113
03:22:51,710 --> 03:22:54,130
Those fucking posies gave me...

6114
03:22:54,130 --> 03:22:55,770
Dude, I lived there for three years.

6115
03:22:55,770 --> 03:22:56,710
And then...

6116
03:22:56,710 --> 03:22:58,350
I was fine for three years.

6117
03:22:58,450 --> 03:23:00,230
And then all of a sudden, they just...

6118
03:23:00,230 --> 03:23:02,130
Back to back to back noise complaint me.

6119
03:23:02,230 --> 03:23:03,830
And I'm like, Alright, I guess I gotta fucking move.

6120
03:23:03,950 --> 03:23:05,070
Because they didn't renew my lease.

6121
03:23:06,290 --> 03:23:07,010
These motherfuckers.

6122
03:23:07,130 --> 03:23:08,930
Wait, they did not renew your lease.

6123
03:23:09,130 --> 03:23:10,350
Isn't that an eviction?

6124
03:23:15,350 --> 03:23:15,710
Motherfuckers.

6125
03:23:15,750 --> 03:23:17,950
That's the most annoying part about apartments.

6126
03:23:18,230 --> 03:23:20,290
Is literally, if you're like a streamer, you have to be loud.

6127
03:23:20,710 --> 03:23:20,810
Yeah, bro.

6128
03:23:21,070 --> 03:23:21,630
Fuck, bro.

6129
03:23:21,830 --> 03:23:22,750
I lived there for three years.

6130
03:23:22,750 --> 03:23:25,110
I never had a single problem until the last, like, two months.

6131
03:23:25,110 --> 03:23:26,930
And they just spammed it on cooldown.

6132
03:23:27,270 --> 03:23:28,110
Dude, like, tenants?

6133
03:23:28,110 --> 03:23:28,950
Was it new neighbors?

6134
03:23:28,950 --> 03:23:29,650
Yeah, new neighbors.

6135
03:23:29,850 --> 03:23:30,350
They probably got new tenants.

6136
03:23:30,750 --> 03:23:30,990
Yeah.

6137
03:23:32,230 --> 03:23:34,870
I wonder why the other tenants were so cool.

6138
03:23:35,130 --> 03:23:37,030
It wasn't like their own entertainment.

6139
03:23:37,590 --> 03:23:38,030
Dude, I don't know.

6140
03:23:38,110 --> 03:23:39,790
It's probably like an old person that moved in.

6141
03:23:39,890 --> 03:23:40,410
I don't know.

6142
03:23:40,590 --> 03:23:43,210
They turn off their hearing aid whenever you go live.

6143
03:23:44,650 --> 03:23:45,590
Yeah, literally.

6144
03:23:46,210 --> 03:23:47,810
The hearing aid goes off.

6145
03:23:48,250 --> 03:23:49,250
They're like, there he goes.

6146
03:23:51,370 --> 03:23:51,850
Yeah.

6147
03:23:52,550 --> 03:23:53,130
Oh, well.

6148
03:23:53,510 --> 03:23:53,810
Whatever.

6149
03:23:54,450 --> 03:23:55,310
Are you still...

6150
03:23:55,310 --> 03:23:56,350
Are you doing an apartment now?

6151
03:23:56,510 --> 03:23:57,550
Or is it like a house?

6152
03:23:57,730 --> 03:23:57,850
No, no, no, no.

6153
03:23:57,950 --> 03:23:58,670
There's no way.

6154
03:23:59,050 --> 03:23:59,130
Yeah.

6155
03:23:59,570 --> 03:23:59,830
Oh, yeah.

6156
03:23:59,950 --> 03:24:00,470
I was gonna say.

6157
03:24:01,150 --> 03:24:02,590
You're really gonna risk another apartment.

6158
03:24:02,910 --> 03:24:03,150
No chance after that, bro.

6159
03:24:03,170 --> 03:24:03,650
Fuck that.

6160
03:24:04,870 --> 03:24:09,030
Dude, apartments also have that stupid thing where they get, like, contracts with the ISPs.

6161
03:24:09,290 --> 03:24:11,710
So if you, like, move in there, you have to use their ISP.

6162
03:24:12,130 --> 03:24:16,510
And I was in a run once where I literally had to use Xfinity because they bought out the entire fucking complex.

6163
03:24:16,930 --> 03:24:17,830
Ooh, FlexCast don't even get me started.

6164
03:24:18,070 --> 03:24:18,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6165
03:24:18,570 --> 03:24:19,410
Don't even get me started on FlexCast.

6166
03:24:19,410 --> 03:24:21,010
I could not stream that entire year.

6167
03:24:21,010 --> 03:24:24,270
Lag and, like, fucking FPS drops, like, no tomorrow.

6168
03:24:24,570 --> 03:24:25,570
Like, it was so bad.

6169
03:24:25,710 --> 03:24:27,110
Don't get me started on fucking...

6170
03:24:27,110 --> 03:24:28,130
That sounds terrible.

6171
03:24:28,590 --> 03:24:30,290
I wanna jump out my apartment window in-game, of course.

6172
03:24:31,930 --> 03:24:33,030
In-game, of course.

6173
03:24:33,090 --> 03:24:33,990
In Minecraft, yeah.

6174
03:24:34,410 --> 03:24:35,790
In Minecraft, actually.

6175
03:24:36,030 --> 03:24:37,630
Yeah, you jump into that lava there.

6176
03:24:37,730 --> 03:24:37,950
Specifically.

6177
03:24:38,870 --> 03:24:39,350
Specifically.

6178
03:24:42,090 --> 03:24:43,150
That's crazy, yeah.

6179
03:24:43,390 --> 03:24:44,670
I live in an apartment, guys.

6180
03:24:46,570 --> 03:24:47,950
So I don't have to deal...

6181
03:24:47,950 --> 03:24:48,550
I don't know.

6182
03:24:48,690 --> 03:24:49,790
I never got noise complaints.

6183
03:24:49,990 --> 03:24:50,570
I think it's my door.

6184
03:24:50,850 --> 03:24:51,770
It's, like, a new...

6185
03:24:51,770 --> 03:24:52,330
That's interesting.

6186
03:24:52,610 --> 03:24:55,210
In Summon's team, they actually favor the Punisher comp.

6187
03:24:55,570 --> 03:24:57,490
Like, that's their strongest comp, and we beat them at it.

6188
03:24:57,930 --> 03:24:58,590
I think...

6189
03:24:58,590 --> 03:24:59,250
Well, obviously.

6190
03:24:59,430 --> 03:25:01,210
I think it's just because, like, the players they have.

6191
03:25:02,070 --> 03:25:03,330
I mean, do you wanna ban Punisher or no?

6192
03:25:03,450 --> 03:25:04,290
What do we even ban against them?

6193
03:25:04,390 --> 03:25:04,570
Yeah.

6194
03:25:04,810 --> 03:25:06,310
I mean, they could be handless, though.

6195
03:25:06,690 --> 03:25:06,950
Off of it.

6196
03:25:07,030 --> 03:25:09,530
I don't know if that Daltouche guy plays anything than Punisher.

6197
03:25:10,250 --> 03:25:13,310
Well, it's because Daltouche comes from Apex, so Punisher is good.

6198
03:25:13,790 --> 03:25:14,230
Yeah.

6199
03:25:14,230 --> 03:25:15,530
Like, transfer of skills for that.

6200
03:25:16,190 --> 03:25:16,470
But, like...

6201
03:25:16,470 --> 03:25:17,530
That could be an interesting ban against them.

6202
03:25:19,150 --> 03:25:19,590
Um...

6203
03:25:19,590 --> 03:25:21,430
But we're playing against...

6204
03:25:21,430 --> 03:25:22,150
Um...

6205
03:25:22,150 --> 03:25:25,630
We're playing against Shroud's teams next, so...

6206
03:25:25,630 --> 03:25:26,290
Mm-mm-mm.

6207
03:25:26,610 --> 03:25:27,130
Shroud's team.

6208
03:25:27,130 --> 03:25:28,290
We fucked up the banline.

6209
03:25:28,510 --> 03:25:29,610
We fucked up the banline against them.

6210
03:25:29,610 --> 03:25:30,510
Let me look at the...

6211
03:25:30,510 --> 03:25:31,390
Let me look at the fucking...

6212
03:25:31,910 --> 03:25:33,350
The VODs time.

6213
03:25:35,470 --> 03:25:36,170
Shroud's team.

6214
03:25:37,770 --> 03:25:39,110
I know, Shroud was on Hella.

6215
03:25:39,710 --> 03:25:41,650
Shroud was on Hella, and then...

6216
03:25:41,650 --> 03:25:43,270
Hella was definitely tough to deal with.

6217
03:25:43,290 --> 03:25:44,010
We banned Human Torch.

6218
03:25:44,150 --> 03:25:44,810
I mean, do you think we...

6219
03:25:44,810 --> 03:25:46,070
Would he play Human Torch?

6220
03:25:46,190 --> 03:25:48,210
I just don't want to get, like, owned by a Human Torch.

6221
03:25:48,450 --> 03:25:49,410
I don't think he...

6222
03:25:49,410 --> 03:25:51,690
I mean, it is his third most played this season, I think.

6223
03:25:52,150 --> 03:25:52,470
Yeah.

6224
03:25:53,210 --> 03:25:55,650
He's been playing Hella, though, throughout this tournament.

6225
03:25:55,910 --> 03:25:56,590
Yeah, yeah.

6226
03:25:56,770 --> 03:25:57,470
I think...

6227
03:25:57,890 --> 03:25:59,630
If we do ban Mag, they're gonna protect Hella.

6228
03:25:59,730 --> 03:26:01,830
If we ban Hella, they're gonna protect Mag.

6229
03:26:01,830 --> 03:26:06,430
It's whether we think the Mag is more of a problem than the Hella.

6230
03:26:06,930 --> 03:26:07,010
Wait.

6231
03:26:07,150 --> 03:26:08,290
I mean, honestly, like, I can...

6232
03:26:08,290 --> 03:26:09,830
Like, the Mag is, like, no problem for me.

6233
03:26:10,310 --> 03:26:10,370
He...

6234
03:26:10,790 --> 03:26:11,830
He has played Human Torch.

6235
03:26:11,830 --> 03:26:13,190
He's doing nasty things on Mag.

6236
03:26:13,370 --> 03:26:16,570
The only reason I say that is because Space just literally only plays Mag.

6237
03:26:16,710 --> 03:26:17,930
I mean, he plays other things, too, but, like...

6238
03:26:18,970 --> 03:26:20,150
He's really comfortable on Mag, but...

6239
03:26:20,150 --> 03:26:21,290
His Mag is, like, his strongest.

6240
03:26:21,510 --> 03:26:22,970
And it did protect Mag first, so...

6241
03:26:23,650 --> 03:26:23,950
Yeah.

6242
03:26:24,950 --> 03:26:25,350
Um...

6243
03:26:25,350 --> 03:26:26,650
I'm okay to do...

6244
03:26:26,650 --> 03:26:26,990
Whatever.

6245
03:26:28,230 --> 03:26:28,630
Um...

6246
03:26:28,630 --> 03:26:30,430
But, Shroud does play Human Torch, though.

6247
03:26:30,930 --> 03:26:31,170
He...

6248
03:26:31,170 --> 03:26:33,550
He plays Human Torch when it's mirrored, I think.

6249
03:26:34,190 --> 03:26:34,430
Yeah.

6250
03:26:36,390 --> 03:26:37,730
Other than that, it's mostly, like...

6251
03:26:37,730 --> 03:26:39,990
His character is just literally fucking Thanos, but, yeah.

6252
03:26:41,310 --> 03:26:46,070
I don't know if he plays Human Torch when it's not mirrored, because the only time he does it.

6253
03:26:46,090 --> 03:26:47,730
If anything, if anything, they're always...

6254
03:26:47,730 --> 03:26:52,250
They're gonna either protect Teller or protect Mag, so I think Human Torch banned first is probably ideal.

6255
03:26:55,130 --> 03:26:55,570
Mmm...

6256
03:26:55,570 --> 03:26:56,130
Because, like...

6257
03:26:56,130 --> 03:26:59,050
Because, like, then we choose between them protecting that.

6258
03:26:59,230 --> 03:27:02,290
Because, like, imagine they get the Human Torch instead.

6259
03:27:02,590 --> 03:27:03,310
Like, that's just...

6260
03:27:03,310 --> 03:27:04,910
Not ideal, I guess.

6261
03:27:05,950 --> 03:27:06,150
Yeah.

6262
03:27:06,150 --> 03:27:09,930
Regardless, if I ban Hella first, they're gonna protect...

6263
03:27:12,110 --> 03:27:12,830
Probably, uh...

6264
03:27:12,830 --> 03:27:14,610
Or, if I ban Hella first, they're gonna protect Mag, or whatever.

6265
03:27:14,910 --> 03:27:16,470
Or, they might just protect Human Torch, I don't know.

6266
03:27:19,790 --> 03:27:20,150
Mmm...

6267
03:27:20,150 --> 03:27:20,570
It's difficult.

6268
03:27:20,790 --> 03:27:23,970
And then we can't ban Hella, because Hella's kind of, like, the only counter to that.

6269
03:27:24,370 --> 03:27:24,650
Yeah.

6270
03:27:25,650 --> 03:27:29,070
Or Psylocke, but I don't know if you're comfortable with Psylocke against it.

6271
03:27:29,770 --> 03:27:30,030
Yeah.

6272
03:27:31,530 --> 03:27:31,970
Yeah.

6273
03:27:31,970 --> 03:27:32,350
Um...

6274
03:27:32,350 --> 03:27:32,590
But...

6275
03:27:32,590 --> 03:27:35,490
The only time he has played Human Torch was against...

6276
03:27:35,490 --> 03:27:35,850
Yeah.

6277
03:27:35,850 --> 03:27:36,590
Nekros' team.

6278
03:27:36,910 --> 03:27:38,890
Like, every other time he's just been playing Hella.

6279
03:27:39,850 --> 03:27:40,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6280
03:27:43,790 --> 03:27:44,230
I...

6281
03:27:44,730 --> 03:27:45,170
Mmm...

6282
03:27:46,210 --> 03:27:46,650
Mmm...

6283
03:27:47,290 --> 03:27:47,990
I don't know.

6284
03:27:48,110 --> 03:27:48,430
I don't know.

6285
03:27:48,590 --> 03:27:49,290
Maybe during...

6286
03:27:49,290 --> 03:27:50,630
Maybe he won't fuck around, though.

6287
03:27:50,730 --> 03:27:51,690
Because it is...

6288
03:27:51,690 --> 03:27:52,410
Elimination.

6289
03:27:54,110 --> 03:27:55,290
Might not fuck around.

6290
03:27:56,510 --> 03:27:57,970
And just pull out the torch.

6291
03:27:59,590 --> 03:28:00,070
Mmm...

6292
03:28:00,070 --> 03:28:00,930
I hate bad line.

6293
03:28:01,230 --> 03:28:01,970
That's like...

6294
03:28:03,890 --> 03:28:04,570
It's all...

6295
03:28:04,570 --> 03:28:05,470
It's just chess.

6296
03:28:11,910 --> 03:28:12,610
This sucks.

6297
03:28:12,690 --> 03:28:14,310
Because it's like, literally just rock, paper, scissors.

6298
03:28:14,550 --> 03:28:15,190
If you have a...

6299
03:28:15,190 --> 03:28:17,730
Okay, so I was told that apparently, like...

6300
03:28:18,930 --> 03:28:23,070
Reasons why, like, even some of the bestest teams lose, like...

6301
03:28:23,070 --> 03:28:26,010
Lose, like, an upset, is literally just...

6302
03:28:26,010 --> 03:28:26,610
Alright, let's see.

6303
03:28:27,370 --> 03:28:28,350
What the fuck is Marcel?

6304
03:28:29,730 --> 03:28:31,570
It's just...

6305
03:28:31,570 --> 03:28:31,970
Bad line.

6306
03:28:33,010 --> 03:28:33,510
No.

6307
03:28:33,970 --> 03:28:34,170
Whoa.

6308
03:28:35,190 --> 03:28:37,310
Tynz is so far up with that Punisher roll.

6309
03:28:41,030 --> 03:28:41,950
Idiot.

6310
03:28:44,310 --> 03:28:46,850
I'm so fucking stupid.

6311
03:28:52,970 --> 03:28:53,890
Alright.

6312
03:28:54,590 --> 03:28:55,390
There we go.

6313
03:28:57,890 --> 03:28:58,670
Oh my god.

6314
03:28:59,590 --> 03:28:59,650
Oh my god.

6315
03:28:59,650 --> 03:29:00,270
Okay, he got the part.

6316
03:29:00,270 --> 03:29:00,530
It's literally...

6317
03:29:01,030 --> 03:29:02,330
Mostly it's just...

6318
03:29:02,330 --> 03:29:03,770
Figuring out...

6319
03:29:03,770 --> 03:29:04,850
The bad line.

6320
03:29:04,990 --> 03:29:06,290
Because it's just rock, paper, scissors.

6321
03:29:06,650 --> 03:29:07,090
With it.

6322
03:29:08,810 --> 03:29:09,290
Um...

6323
03:29:09,290 --> 03:29:12,430
To make sure people don't spam invite you, just...

6324
03:29:12,430 --> 03:29:13,230
Block them.

6325
03:29:13,830 --> 03:29:15,810
I just type out their names and just block them.

6326
03:29:19,500 --> 03:29:19,980
Uh...

6327
03:29:19,980 --> 03:29:21,120
That's really it.

6328
03:29:21,740 --> 03:29:23,140
That's how you get out of it.

6329
03:29:27,950 --> 03:29:28,550
Uh...

6330
03:29:28,550 --> 03:29:28,690
Alright.

6331
03:29:28,830 --> 03:29:30,410
Let's see who's playing right now.

6332
03:29:30,970 --> 03:29:32,610
It is...

6333
03:29:34,270 --> 03:29:35,870
Oh, it's a...

6334
03:29:35,870 --> 03:29:36,170
Okay.

6335
03:29:36,510 --> 03:29:37,910
Who's winning at the moment?

6336
03:29:38,510 --> 03:29:38,930
Attack.

6337
03:29:39,270 --> 03:29:39,510
Oh!

6338
03:29:40,390 --> 03:29:41,430
Summon's team is...

6339
03:29:41,430 --> 03:29:42,110
Pushing hard.

6340
03:29:45,550 --> 03:29:46,150
Wait.

6341
03:29:46,450 --> 03:29:46,750
Oh!

6342
03:29:46,910 --> 03:29:47,470
Okay, it's gonna sit.

6343
03:29:48,630 --> 03:29:49,030
Okay.

6344
03:29:49,330 --> 03:29:50,210
ML7's on rocket.

6345
03:29:51,630 --> 03:29:52,030
That's...

6346
03:29:52,030 --> 03:29:53,510
Oh, I guess cause like Epic Will is on...

6347
03:29:54,690 --> 03:29:55,730
There's a Luna one trick.

6348
03:29:56,510 --> 03:29:57,130
We winning?

6349
03:29:57,430 --> 03:29:58,030
I don't know.

6350
03:29:58,390 --> 03:29:59,390
I could play a quick play.

6351
03:29:59,850 --> 03:30:01,610
I have time for a quick play match.

6352
03:30:03,210 --> 03:30:03,950
Oh my gosh.

6353
03:30:04,050 --> 03:30:05,890
I have lots of time for a quick play match.

6354
03:30:07,670 --> 03:30:09,490
I can leave a quick play match.

6355
03:30:09,590 --> 03:30:10,130
It's fine.

6356
03:30:11,690 --> 03:30:12,570
But what if...

6357
03:30:12,570 --> 03:30:13,230
Oh, you're right.

6358
03:30:13,450 --> 03:30:13,770
What if...

6359
03:30:13,770 --> 03:30:14,610
I should play boons.

6360
03:30:16,630 --> 03:30:17,070
Um...

6361
03:30:17,070 --> 03:30:18,410
I've just been playing like...

6362
03:30:18,410 --> 03:30:19,590
Off my character.

6363
03:30:19,870 --> 03:30:20,990
So I might as well just practice.

6364
03:30:22,210 --> 03:30:23,370
If we're playing against...

6365
03:30:23,370 --> 03:30:23,770
XQC.

6366
03:30:23,830 --> 03:30:25,270
What was I playing against for XQC?

6367
03:30:25,730 --> 03:30:27,090
Was I playing triple res?

6368
03:30:27,270 --> 03:30:27,490
Yeah.

6369
03:30:28,270 --> 03:30:28,470
Okay.

6370
03:30:28,810 --> 03:30:29,250
Adam...

6371
03:30:29,250 --> 03:30:30,470
Jeff is not it though.

6372
03:30:33,070 --> 03:30:33,650
That's right.

6373
03:30:33,730 --> 03:30:35,250
You swap off Jeff right now.

6374
03:30:37,950 --> 03:30:39,210
I need a practice.

6375
03:30:44,060 --> 03:30:44,780
It's crazy.

6376
03:30:45,220 --> 03:30:46,560
I haven't been able to play a Luna at all.

6377
03:30:47,220 --> 03:30:50,240
I will leave this universe a better place than it was.

6378
03:30:50,240 --> 03:30:50,380
Alright.

6379
03:30:50,600 --> 03:30:51,940
I need to practice my positioning.

6380
03:30:52,040 --> 03:30:53,820
My position on Adam has been so ass.

6381
03:30:54,880 --> 03:30:56,280
Cause I don't play Adam a lot.

6382
03:30:56,300 --> 03:30:57,260
30 seconds before you attack.

6383
03:30:57,720 --> 03:30:58,180
Get ready.

6384
03:30:58,900 --> 03:31:00,100
But it's been like pretty ass.

6385
03:31:02,080 --> 03:31:02,560
So...

6386
03:31:03,220 --> 03:31:06,800
You commune with ancient gods once in open the moon, right doc?

6387
03:31:07,140 --> 03:31:07,840
Just care?

6388
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:09,560
I care because like...

6389
03:31:09,560 --> 03:31:11,240
I need more survivability.

6390
03:31:11,240 --> 03:31:13,200
It's not good practice.

6391
03:31:13,700 --> 03:31:14,340
It's not good practice.

6392
03:31:14,340 --> 03:31:18,000
Like even if I'm like forcing Adam, it's not good practice that I'm playing with Jeff.

6393
03:31:19,240 --> 03:31:21,260
The battle starts in 5...

6394
03:31:21,260 --> 03:31:22,260
4...

6395
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:23,680
3...

6396
03:31:23,680 --> 03:31:24,340
2...

6397
03:31:24,340 --> 03:31:25,200
1...

6398
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:26,200
1...

6399
03:31:26,780 --> 03:31:26,920
1...

6400
03:31:29,240 --> 03:31:30,640
1...

6401
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:30,780
1...

6402
03:31:30,780 --> 03:31:30,840
1...

6403
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:30,860
1...

6404
03:31:30,860 --> 03:31:31,000
1...

6405
03:31:32,420 --> 03:31:33,820
1...

6406
03:31:45,620 --> 03:31:47,020
1...

6407
03:31:53,780 --> 03:31:55,180
1...

6408
03:31:59,340 --> 03:32:00,600
Minus one sec- Really?

6409
03:32:00,940 --> 03:32:01,560
Oh my god.

6410
03:32:01,840 --> 03:32:02,660
I did not know that.

6411
03:32:02,840 --> 03:32:05,820
If I knew that, I would have aimed for the head more.

6412
03:32:10,900 --> 03:32:11,400
What?

6413
03:32:11,600 --> 03:32:12,780
I had Solban!

6414
03:32:15,020 --> 03:32:16,120
Oh, I see.

6415
03:32:16,460 --> 03:32:17,780
It reduces E cooldown.

6416
03:32:18,340 --> 03:32:21,120
See, this is how long I haven't played Adam.

6417
03:32:23,080 --> 03:32:24,700
That's how long it was.

6418
03:32:26,860 --> 03:32:27,620
See, guys?

6419
03:32:27,820 --> 03:32:30,320
Crashing out before the tournament ended up being good for me.

6420
03:32:31,460 --> 03:32:32,900
If you think about it.

6421
03:32:35,080 --> 03:32:36,680
Oh, somebody left already.

6422
03:32:41,280 --> 03:32:43,020
Ended up being really good for me.

6423
03:32:47,740 --> 03:32:49,940
Yeah, all the bad things.

6424
03:32:50,780 --> 03:32:58,820
You know, I was like dooming and everything and thinking that I was gonna be last pick because I'm just a little support player.

6425
03:32:59,300 --> 03:33:02,020
And then I'm like, oh wait, it's not that bad!

6426
03:33:03,740 --> 03:33:05,700
I was the last pick!

6427
03:33:05,940 --> 03:33:08,560
Things go- Things are going for Doki.

6428
03:33:09,160 --> 03:33:09,240
There's still so much to do.

6429
03:33:09,880 --> 03:33:10,260
Hehehehehehe.

6430
03:33:11,500 --> 03:33:12,260
Hehehehehehe.

6431
03:33:12,580 --> 03:33:13,340
Hehehehe.

6432
03:33:13,420 --> 03:33:14,140
Hehehehe.

6433
03:33:15,380 --> 03:33:16,140
Hehehehe.

6434
03:33:27,560 --> 03:33:28,320
Hehehehe.

6435
03:33:37,380 --> 03:33:38,140
Hehehehe.

6436
03:33:38,140 --> 03:33:39,160
Yippee!

6437
03:33:41,340 --> 03:33:42,720
We have no tank!

6438
03:33:50,650 --> 03:33:52,230
We have no tank!

6439
03:33:52,570 --> 03:33:53,090
Yippee!

6440
03:33:55,330 --> 03:33:57,250
It's fine, I'm just gonna go this way.

6441
03:33:58,830 --> 03:34:00,050
It's fine, I'm gonna throw.

6442
03:34:03,150 --> 03:34:04,090
Is it worth it?

6443
03:34:04,090 --> 03:34:04,970
I'm airborne again!

6444
03:34:05,970 --> 03:34:07,190
Ameri-crow touched it.

6445
03:34:08,770 --> 03:34:11,470
Wait, does that not pick up- Oh my god.

6446
03:34:13,770 --> 03:34:14,430
That's right.

6447
03:34:16,670 --> 03:34:17,470
There we go.

6448
03:34:18,070 --> 03:34:19,750
Don't worry, I'm picking you up.

6449
03:34:20,950 --> 03:34:21,470
NOOOO!

6450
03:34:21,970 --> 03:34:23,190
NO ONE'S ON POINT!

6451
03:34:27,410 --> 03:34:27,930
Okay,

6452
03:34:32,090 --> 03:34:32,470
it's fine.

6453
03:34:32,710 --> 03:34:37,070
I get the crash out now, in quick play, and I'll be okay in the tournament.

6454
03:34:37,330 --> 03:34:39,750
I'll be okay in the tournament.

6455
03:34:41,730 --> 03:34:42,630
That's okay.

6456
03:34:46,310 --> 03:34:46,870
Nice.

6457
03:34:47,170 --> 03:34:47,990
I got two kills.

6458
03:34:48,130 --> 03:34:49,990
Oh my gosh, my team is not okay.

6459
03:34:50,410 --> 03:34:53,810
I almost have the same amount of damage as my heals.

6460
03:34:54,110 --> 03:34:54,870
That's not okay.

6461
03:35:00,910 --> 03:35:02,790
I wish Adam has better skins.

6462
03:35:02,970 --> 03:35:05,690
Adam Warlock skins are fucking terrible, I'm gonna say it.

6463
03:35:05,910 --> 03:35:07,050
I'm gonna change my mind.

6464
03:35:08,590 --> 03:35:11,970
I think the supports have the worst skins.

6465
03:35:12,270 --> 03:35:15,010
Except for Jeff and Rocket for some fucking reason.

6466
03:35:15,010 --> 03:35:18,330
Jeff and Rocket have the best support skins, and I hate it.

6467
03:35:18,630 --> 03:35:23,150
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

6468
03:35:23,590 --> 03:35:23,930
Got it?

6469
03:35:23,970 --> 03:35:25,470
Luna has one good skin.

6470
03:35:25,790 --> 03:35:27,510
I'm used to fighting on the streets.

6471
03:35:28,330 --> 03:35:30,730
Luna only has one good skin.

6472
03:35:31,410 --> 03:35:33,070
Loki has one good skin.

6473
03:35:34,810 --> 03:35:36,830
And that's the president skin.

6474
03:35:39,290 --> 03:35:45,070
I think personally, I think his only good skin was...

6475
03:35:54,870 --> 03:35:56,650
Okay, I needed that.

6476
03:35:57,850 --> 03:35:59,010
Oh, nice.

6477
03:36:03,430 --> 03:36:04,150
Nice.

6478
03:36:07,570 --> 03:36:10,010
What the fuck is wrong with you?

6479
03:36:10,750 --> 03:36:11,430
Kill him!

6480
03:36:12,230 --> 03:36:12,850
Oh my god.

6481
03:36:13,870 --> 03:36:15,430
How is he still alive?

6482
03:36:17,710 --> 03:36:18,430
Please!

6483
03:36:18,970 --> 03:36:20,970
Just kill the support!

6484
03:36:24,650 --> 03:36:26,470
Okay, at least I get healed.

6485
03:36:28,630 --> 03:36:31,190
Okay, we're not doing anything about that squirrel.

6486
03:36:31,410 --> 03:36:31,810
I can tell.

6487
03:36:35,110 --> 03:36:35,870
I don't know.

6488
03:36:35,990 --> 03:36:37,710
I guess Cloak's skin is okay.

6489
03:36:38,210 --> 03:36:39,290
I guess so.

6490
03:36:39,990 --> 03:36:40,830
Only one of them.

6491
03:36:40,930 --> 03:36:43,470
I feel like the supports have so little good skins.

6492
03:36:44,090 --> 03:36:46,750
Like it's only- It's always like one for me.

6493
03:36:47,190 --> 03:36:49,730
There's like only like one good skin.

6494
03:36:50,790 --> 03:36:51,730
Or like none.

6495
03:36:51,970 --> 03:36:52,610
It's one or none.

6496
03:36:52,770 --> 03:36:55,230
I don't- Only like Luna's battle pass skin and that's it.

6497
03:36:56,190 --> 03:36:57,730
That was the only good skin for me.

6498
03:36:57,850 --> 03:36:59,190
I don't like her...

6499
03:36:59,190 --> 03:37:01,730
Twin tail one and her...

6500
03:37:01,730 --> 03:37:02,730
Dress one.

6501
03:37:02,850 --> 03:37:03,850
I don't like it in general.

6502
03:37:04,870 --> 03:37:05,310
Really?

6503
03:37:05,490 --> 03:37:06,590
We're just gonna let her do that?

6504
03:37:08,430 --> 03:37:10,790
Also like Cloak is not like meta.

6505
03:37:11,230 --> 03:37:13,350
So like for me- That's why I don't like-

6506
03:37:17,190 --> 03:37:18,170
There you go.

6507
03:37:19,050 --> 03:37:26,210
So like- I never like look into getting Cloak skins just cause it- I will Sobon just to save myself.

6508
03:37:26,410 --> 03:37:27,530
Don't think I won't do it.

6509
03:37:28,710 --> 03:37:29,810
It doesn't matter.

6510
03:37:30,690 --> 03:37:32,150
He timed it!

6511
03:37:32,470 --> 03:37:33,490
It doesn't matter!

6512
03:37:34,330 --> 03:37:36,030
He fucking timed it!

6513
03:37:40,250 --> 03:37:41,390
Unlucky for me.

6514
03:37:43,510 --> 03:37:44,650
I was ready.

6515
03:37:48,030 --> 03:37:48,930
I don't know.

6516
03:37:49,190 --> 03:37:51,670
Not a fan of her dra- I'm not a fan of her dragon skin.

6517
03:37:51,750 --> 03:37:54,570
I think her best skin- I think Mantis is best skin that I do.

6518
03:37:54,670 --> 03:37:56,710
I don't like- I don't even like her grass one.

6519
03:37:56,890 --> 03:37:58,790
The tree- The tree one?

6520
03:37:59,150 --> 03:38:00,110
Not a fan of it.

6521
03:38:00,690 --> 03:38:01,650
I'm just a hater.

6522
03:38:02,810 --> 03:38:03,370
You know what?

6523
03:38:04,170 --> 03:38:05,050
I'm just a hater.

6524
03:38:07,090 --> 03:38:09,590
You were never the good guy, Castle.

6525
03:38:09,930 --> 03:38:10,490
Sorry.

6526
03:38:14,130 --> 03:38:18,050
I just think Jeff and Rocket for some fucking reason have like all the best skins.

6527
03:38:18,550 --> 03:38:19,650
And I hate it.

6528
03:38:24,920 --> 03:38:26,860
I so bonded two people.

6529
03:38:27,080 --> 03:38:28,360
Oh, it's me and the Mantis.

6530
03:38:28,540 --> 03:38:29,460
Okay, we're dead though.

6531
03:38:29,860 --> 03:38:31,340
But I can do this.

6532
03:38:32,680 --> 03:38:34,160
And is she's gonna follow me?

6533
03:38:34,960 --> 03:38:35,480
No?

6534
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:36,220
Okay.

6535
03:38:38,200 --> 03:38:38,720
Yay!

6536
03:38:42,240 --> 03:38:42,760
Yay!

6537
03:38:43,580 --> 03:38:44,480
We dead.

6538
03:38:45,700 --> 03:38:46,540
I'm dead.

6539
03:38:49,960 --> 03:38:51,540
I knew it was over.

6540
03:38:51,820 --> 03:38:56,860
I went for the- I went for the Emma- For the Emma play.

6541
03:38:57,260 --> 03:38:58,860
That might not have been it.

6542
03:39:00,220 --> 03:39:00,820
Yay!

6543
03:39:01,200 --> 03:39:03,800
I love playing a guy that dies so fast!

6544
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:11,040
My Oshi back at it again with the bad takes.

6545
03:39:11,400 --> 03:39:12,760
Also, Mantis isn't meta.

6546
03:39:12,760 --> 03:39:12,840
Yeah.

6547
03:39:13,060 --> 03:39:14,500
Alright, let me reword this.

6548
03:39:14,640 --> 03:39:17,180
All the meta supports are bad.

6549
03:39:17,520 --> 03:39:20,120
Or have- All the meta supports have bad support skins.

6550
03:39:20,580 --> 03:39:21,480
There we go.

6551
03:39:25,140 --> 03:39:25,840
That's it.

6552
03:39:29,040 --> 03:39:29,860
There we go.

6553
03:39:30,040 --> 03:39:32,520
Mantis is bare- Mantis is only meta during triple support.

6554
03:39:37,830 --> 03:39:40,090
They are meta in my heart!

6555
03:39:41,110 --> 03:39:44,710
We're literally running triple support because it's good against content creator teams.

6556
03:39:44,710 --> 03:39:45,950
Yo, is anybody here?

6557
03:39:48,010 --> 03:39:48,530
Yeah?

6558
03:39:49,030 --> 03:39:49,230
What's up?

6559
03:39:49,990 --> 03:39:52,210
Is Marvel Rivals your guys' main game?

6560
03:39:53,010 --> 03:39:53,370
No.

6561
03:39:54,170 --> 03:39:54,890
Not for me.

6562
03:39:55,050 --> 03:39:55,190
One.

6563
03:39:58,790 --> 03:40:00,530
30 seconds before you attack.

6564
03:40:00,790 --> 03:40:01,470
Get ready.

6565
03:40:03,110 --> 03:40:08,090
Mantis is not good during in triple- Mantis is only good during triple support and...

6566
03:40:08,870 --> 03:40:09,670
What do you mean?

6567
03:40:09,950 --> 03:40:10,450
X?

6568
03:40:11,850 --> 03:40:13,350
When- Okay, guys.

6569
03:40:13,590 --> 03:40:17,150
I am more of a variety streamer than a rival streamer.

6570
03:40:17,310 --> 03:40:20,250
Look at what I streamed the last three weeks.

6571
03:40:20,250 --> 03:40:22,770
We were playing Simpsons Hit and Run.

6572
03:40:23,090 --> 03:40:27,510
And I was stuck on Dynasty Warriors Origins for four months now.

6573
03:40:27,910 --> 03:40:28,270
You-

6574
03:40:31,930 --> 03:40:37,190
We've been stuck on Dynasty Warriors Origins for so fucking long.

6575
03:40:37,190 --> 03:40:52,330
I am- I am- I am- I am- I am- It was also like, this week has been like the fucking- The- The shoot- The- The shooter week.

6576
03:40:52,650 --> 03:40:58,390
Because we have- We had so many and- We had- We did Overwatch, Apex, and...

6577
03:40:59,450 --> 03:41:01,810
Oh, is it this week or last week?

6578
03:41:02,210 --> 03:41:03,150
I don't remember.

6579
03:41:07,050 --> 03:41:08,770
I don't think her main game.

6580
03:41:11,070 --> 03:41:12,470
Someone's a little late on that.

6581
03:41:15,450 --> 03:41:19,750
I can very confidently say that that is a lie.

6582
03:41:25,370 --> 03:41:28,090
That has not been a thing in a long time.

6583
03:41:30,390 --> 03:41:33,610
Okay, how did the fucking Punisher kill all of us there?

6584
03:41:34,390 --> 03:41:36,530
Oh my god, he's 1hp.

6585
03:41:52,260 --> 03:41:56,780
It's because you guys were not there when I was on my Apex phase or my Overwatch phase.

6586
03:41:57,380 --> 03:42:01,200
If you guys were there, if I was a streamer back then when I was...

6587
03:42:01,200 --> 03:42:06,700
I literally stopped streaming so I could grind more Apex during the Barkknights era.

6588
03:42:07,500 --> 03:42:08,060
Like...

6589
03:42:08,060 --> 03:42:10,440
That was literally a thing I did.

6590
03:42:11,640 --> 03:42:12,200
People...

6591
03:42:12,200 --> 03:42:12,820
Like, I had...

6592
03:42:12,820 --> 03:42:13,940
My chat...

6593
03:42:13,940 --> 03:42:16,060
Like, would be like, where is Doki?

6594
03:42:16,260 --> 03:42:17,140
And I was just...

6595
03:42:17,140 --> 03:42:19,600
I was literally just streaming...

6596
03:42:19,600 --> 03:42:21,340
Just playing Apex.

6597
03:42:21,500 --> 03:42:21,600
Just playing Apex.

6598
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:22,520
No, I was there.

6599
03:42:26,160 --> 03:42:27,190
You were not...

6600
03:42:27,680 --> 03:42:28,220
You were...

6601
03:42:28,220 --> 03:42:29,480
For those who were like...

6602
03:42:29,480 --> 03:42:31,340
Yeah, but you never had sleepless nights.

6603
03:42:31,580 --> 03:42:35,320
I literally stopped streaming so I could play more Apex.

6604
03:42:35,320 --> 03:42:36,120
I...

6605
03:42:36,120 --> 03:42:36,240
I...

6606
03:42:40,860 --> 03:42:43,140
No, I just wanted to commit to the grind.

6607
03:42:43,360 --> 03:42:43,780
That's it.

6608
03:42:44,080 --> 03:42:45,200
I just wanted to be...

6609
03:42:45,200 --> 03:42:46,880
I just wanted to be top 500.

6610
03:42:47,320 --> 03:42:49,360
And the only way to do that was...

6611
03:42:49,360 --> 03:42:50,080
Oh my god.

6612
03:42:50,080 --> 03:42:51,700
My Invisi Woman left me.

6613
03:42:52,220 --> 03:42:52,720
And you...

6614
03:42:52,720 --> 03:42:53,360
I just...

6615
03:42:53,360 --> 03:42:54,400
Get Farming Death.

6616
03:42:57,080 --> 03:42:58,380
But you did the same for...

6617
03:42:58,380 --> 03:42:58,620
Yeah!

6618
03:42:58,960 --> 03:42:59,640
Cause like...

6619
03:42:59,640 --> 03:43:00,500
Rivals is like the...

6620
03:43:00,500 --> 03:43:02,200
You guys get to see my...

6621
03:43:02,200 --> 03:43:03,340
Downward Spiral.

6622
03:43:03,900 --> 03:43:04,220
With...

6623
03:43:05,180 --> 03:43:05,760
With...

6624
03:43:05,760 --> 03:43:06,140
My...

6625
03:43:06,140 --> 03:43:07,460
Like how my addiction works.

6626
03:43:07,740 --> 03:43:09,620
When I find a new game I enjoy.

6627
03:43:10,240 --> 03:43:11,880
That's literally how it works.

6628
03:43:14,100 --> 03:43:15,240
I would like...

6629
03:43:15,240 --> 03:43:16,280
Grind the game out.

6630
03:43:16,460 --> 03:43:17,060
Until like...

6631
03:43:17,060 --> 03:43:17,620
I'm satisfied.

6632
03:43:18,180 --> 03:43:18,700
So...

6633
03:43:18,700 --> 03:43:20,060
When I started playing...

6634
03:43:21,320 --> 03:43:21,900
So...

6635
03:43:24,080 --> 03:43:26,040
When I started playing...

6636
03:43:26,040 --> 03:43:27,740
Like when I started streaming Apex.

6637
03:43:27,920 --> 03:43:28,580
Like in general.

6638
03:43:28,740 --> 03:43:29,380
As a VTuber.

6639
03:43:31,560 --> 03:43:32,040
Um...

6640
03:43:32,040 --> 03:43:32,380
Like...

6641
03:43:32,380 --> 03:43:34,100
That was me casual.

6642
03:43:34,300 --> 03:43:34,800
For those...

6643
03:43:34,800 --> 03:43:36,460
For the people who know me now.

6644
03:43:36,800 --> 03:43:37,720
Or like...

6645
03:43:38,660 --> 03:43:39,480
Or like...

6646
03:43:39,480 --> 03:43:40,720
Oh you were like that on Apex?

6647
03:43:40,780 --> 03:43:43,320
You guys were not there during my darkest hours.

6648
03:43:43,880 --> 03:43:44,780
Oh my god!

6649
03:43:45,300 --> 03:43:47,140
Where do I go?!

6650
03:43:49,060 --> 03:43:50,780
I could res this.

6651
03:43:51,000 --> 03:43:51,740
Is it worth it?

6652
03:43:51,960 --> 03:43:52,520
Fuck it.

6653
03:43:54,060 --> 03:43:54,740
Fuck it.

6654
03:43:54,800 --> 03:43:55,100
Let's go.

6655
03:43:57,220 --> 03:43:57,780
Nevermind.

6656
03:43:59,240 --> 03:43:59,800
What?!

6657
03:44:01,550 --> 03:44:02,070
Oh my...

6658
03:44:02,070 --> 03:44:03,030
I just don't live!

6659
03:44:03,590 --> 03:44:04,370
I am...

6660
03:44:04,370 --> 03:44:04,890
Fuck this.

6661
03:44:05,010 --> 03:44:06,170
The only time I get to play Luna.

6662
03:44:06,650 --> 03:44:07,710
I am...

6663
03:44:10,210 --> 03:44:12,250
This is literally the only time I can play Luna.

6664
03:44:12,810 --> 03:44:14,710
I cannot play...

6665
03:44:15,390 --> 03:44:15,950
Uh...

6666
03:44:15,950 --> 03:44:17,370
Play Adam against this.

6667
03:44:17,490 --> 03:44:18,510
This is actually terrible.

6668
03:44:20,350 --> 03:44:20,910
Adam...

6669
03:44:20,910 --> 03:44:22,010
Dearly is so...

6670
03:44:22,010 --> 03:44:23,450
Terrible against this guy.

6671
03:44:23,690 --> 03:44:24,610
Ha ha ha ha.

6672
03:44:25,050 --> 03:44:28,050
Ha ha ha ha.

6673
03:44:28,370 --> 03:44:30,510
Like I feel like I have more impact right now.

6674
03:44:30,790 --> 03:44:31,390
Doing this.

6675
03:44:44,050 --> 03:44:44,930
Oh that's bad.

6676
03:44:45,090 --> 03:44:45,250
I...

6677
03:44:45,250 --> 03:44:46,630
I used my freeze already.

6678
03:44:47,250 --> 03:44:48,170
That's so bad.

6679
03:44:48,210 --> 03:44:49,150
I used my freeze.

6680
03:44:51,570 --> 03:44:53,470
What do you mean average Adam ult?

6681
03:44:53,530 --> 03:44:55,210
I got double ulted!

6682
03:44:55,510 --> 03:44:56,570
Ha ha ha ha.

6683
03:44:57,490 --> 03:44:58,210
Like...

6684
03:44:58,210 --> 03:44:59,090
I...

6685
03:44:59,090 --> 03:45:00,350
What do I do?!

6686
03:45:00,350 --> 03:45:02,150
They kept the strange ult...

6687
03:45:05,030 --> 03:45:05,750
Oh...

6688
03:45:05,750 --> 03:45:06,290
Shit.

6689
03:45:06,670 --> 03:45:07,870
Ha ha ha ha.

6690
03:45:09,170 --> 03:45:10,330
I was gonna be like...

6691
03:45:10,330 --> 03:45:10,490
What?

6692
03:45:10,770 --> 03:45:12,430
I thought I did it correctly.

6693
03:45:14,490 --> 03:45:15,230
Oh my god.

6694
03:45:15,690 --> 03:45:16,390
I was like...

6695
03:45:16,390 --> 03:45:16,890
What do you mean?

6696
03:45:17,230 --> 03:45:18,510
The game clearly ended.

6697
03:45:25,100 --> 03:45:25,700
Alright.

6698
03:45:26,740 --> 03:45:27,360
Oh yeah.

6699
03:45:27,520 --> 03:45:29,820
XQC's team is wondering why...

6700
03:45:33,440 --> 03:45:34,040
Um...

6701
03:45:36,020 --> 03:45:38,520
XQC's team is wondering why we're playing against us.

6702
03:45:39,140 --> 03:45:39,740
Hahahaha.

6703
03:45:45,240 --> 03:45:46,600
Adam is just difficult.

6704
03:45:47,700 --> 03:45:49,460
Ha ha ha ha ha.

6705
03:45:53,760 --> 03:45:54,360
Okay.

6706
03:45:54,580 --> 03:45:54,780
Okay.

6707
03:45:56,720 --> 03:45:57,320
Okay.

6708
03:45:57,460 --> 03:45:59,020
How long has this guy been spamming?

6709
03:46:05,530 --> 03:46:06,610
There you go.

6710
03:46:08,390 --> 03:46:09,930
This guy's been spamming now.

6711
03:46:09,930 --> 03:46:10,390
I don't need that.

6712
03:46:10,650 --> 03:46:10,830
Okay.

6713
03:46:11,250 --> 03:46:12,590
I don't care.

6714
03:46:13,370 --> 03:46:13,890
Wait.

6715
03:46:19,270 --> 03:46:20,530
Okay, look at this.

6716
03:46:21,430 --> 03:46:22,230
Look at that shit.

6717
03:46:26,650 --> 03:46:27,890
Look at this in chat.

6718
03:46:46,330 --> 03:46:48,250
I love... GG's.

6719
03:46:48,370 --> 03:46:50,460
Now shut the fuck up, Lassie.

6720
03:46:54,870 --> 03:46:57,330
Like, why are we fighting?

6721
03:46:57,630 --> 03:47:00,750
Why are we fighting my... like, my team?

6722
03:47:02,490 --> 03:47:03,610
That's funny.

6723
03:47:05,170 --> 03:47:05,730
Paste!

6724
03:47:11,110 --> 03:47:14,530
Be quiet and lose to Tyler1.

6725
03:47:20,480 --> 03:47:22,020
Tyler is brutal.

6726
03:47:22,560 --> 03:47:24,480
I'm so happy I got on a team with Tyler1.

6727
03:47:24,720 --> 03:47:25,700
That's crazy.

6728
03:47:26,040 --> 03:47:26,580
I think like...

6729
03:47:27,920 --> 03:47:29,600
I think it's like...

6730
03:47:30,200 --> 03:47:33,120
I don't think I'll ever get a moment like this again.

6731
03:47:34,500 --> 03:47:35,260
You know?

6732
03:47:35,460 --> 03:47:36,360
You know what I mean?

6733
03:47:36,800 --> 03:47:38,440
It's like one of those moments like...

6734
03:47:38,440 --> 03:47:41,540
It's like you never expect me to ever play with Tyler1.

6735
03:47:42,320 --> 03:47:43,740
So it's more so it's like...

6736
03:47:43,740 --> 03:47:45,300
It's like something where like...

6737
03:47:45,300 --> 03:47:48,000
I don't think it's ever sort of gonna happen again.

6738
03:47:51,230 --> 03:47:51,670
True.

6739
03:47:52,130 --> 03:47:52,930
Like, like the...

6740
03:47:53,350 --> 03:47:56,570
Like, you know, I'm just a VTuber and I've been a game with Tyler1.

6741
03:47:56,570 --> 03:47:57,330
That's crazy.

6742
03:47:58,430 --> 03:47:59,990
I remember watching that...

6743
03:47:59,990 --> 03:48:02,170
I remember watching it before I even streamed.

6744
03:48:03,830 --> 03:48:05,470
I spent a lot of tournaments recently.

6745
03:48:05,630 --> 03:48:08,730
Yeah, but I think it's like different because what I do is...

6746
03:48:08,730 --> 03:48:10,330
Some of the tournaments that like...

6747
03:48:11,490 --> 03:48:13,790
He's in, I wouldn't really get invited.

6748
03:48:14,030 --> 03:48:16,390
So I'm like super thankful for this invitation.

6749
03:48:16,390 --> 03:48:18,310
Because like, you know...

6750
03:48:18,310 --> 03:48:19,350
Because I play Marvel Rivals.

6751
03:48:19,530 --> 03:48:20,650
So I got really lucky there.

6752
03:48:20,870 --> 03:48:24,450
Because I got an opportunity to be in this tournament.

6753
03:48:24,730 --> 03:48:26,590
Just because like, I play Marvel Rivals.

6754
03:48:26,590 --> 03:48:27,630
And I...

6755
03:48:27,630 --> 03:48:28,850
I do a lot.

6756
03:48:30,250 --> 03:48:32,070
Like, you know, the devs like me.

6757
03:48:32,230 --> 03:48:34,430
Which I'm really happy that the devs like me.

6758
03:48:34,430 --> 03:48:38,010
So I was able to get an internment because of the Marvel Rivals devs.

6759
03:48:38,130 --> 03:48:39,690
Uh, got me in, in general.

6760
03:48:40,370 --> 03:48:41,430
So, uh...

6761
03:48:43,190 --> 03:48:43,710
Uh...

6762
03:48:43,710 --> 03:48:44,610
So it's like...

6763
03:48:45,290 --> 03:48:48,670
Because like, these streamers have like millions of followers.

6764
03:48:49,030 --> 03:48:50,430
And have been doing this for like...

6765
03:48:51,250 --> 03:48:52,290
Fucking years.

6766
03:48:52,810 --> 03:48:53,330
Like...

6767
03:48:53,330 --> 03:48:54,770
If you think about it.

6768
03:48:55,030 --> 03:48:58,570
They've been doing this for like a long time.

6769
03:48:58,810 --> 03:49:00,910
And they've been like, you know, up on the...

6770
03:49:00,910 --> 03:49:02,610
Up on the like...

6771
03:49:02,610 --> 03:49:03,810
The high...

6772
03:49:03,810 --> 03:49:05,690
The top point of like, you know...

6773
03:49:05,690 --> 03:49:06,510
Streaming...

6774
03:49:06,510 --> 03:49:07,450
The streaming tier.

6775
03:49:07,730 --> 03:49:08,630
For the longest time.

6776
03:49:09,030 --> 03:49:10,690
So to have this opportunity is really great.

6777
03:49:10,930 --> 03:49:11,090
Yeah.

6778
03:49:11,810 --> 03:49:12,530
It's really great.

6779
03:49:12,570 --> 03:49:14,930
Especially as like, the only VTubers get invited to.

6780
03:49:15,470 --> 03:49:17,170
Like, in the sea of fleshies.

6781
03:49:20,790 --> 03:49:21,250
Uh...

6782
03:49:21,250 --> 03:49:23,110
Yeah, he's been streaming for more than a fucking decade.

6783
03:49:24,970 --> 03:49:26,930
Like, he's gone through so many arcs.

6784
03:49:27,090 --> 03:49:28,370
Like, now he's a chess player.

6785
03:49:28,670 --> 03:49:30,810
Now he's a really good chess player.

6786
03:49:31,490 --> 03:49:31,950
Uh...

6787
03:49:31,950 --> 03:49:33,130
That one was shocking.

6788
03:49:33,130 --> 03:49:36,010
Tyler won an insane chess player?

6789
03:49:36,330 --> 03:49:37,110
I'm just gonna...

6790
03:49:37,110 --> 03:49:38,210
Practice range.

6791
03:49:38,390 --> 03:49:38,990
Cause like...

6792
03:49:38,990 --> 03:49:40,170
Let's see...

6793
03:49:40,170 --> 03:49:41,950
Oh, they're like on overtime right now.

6794
03:49:45,470 --> 03:49:46,230
Wait, who...

6795
03:49:46,230 --> 03:49:46,750
Did anyone...

6796
03:49:46,750 --> 03:49:47,190
Who won?

6797
03:49:47,930 --> 03:49:49,430
Oh, they're on overtime.

6798
03:49:52,510 --> 03:49:53,610
Where are they playing?

6799
03:49:55,610 --> 03:49:56,210
Bucky...

6800
03:49:56,210 --> 03:49:57,170
Oh, they're doing Bucky...

6801
03:49:58,510 --> 03:49:59,110
Uh...

6802
03:49:59,110 --> 03:50:00,090
Oh, they're mirror.

6803
03:50:00,310 --> 03:50:01,590
Mirror except for Squirrel Girl.

6804
03:50:13,970 --> 03:50:15,170
Yeah, they're...

6805
03:50:16,290 --> 03:50:16,890
Uh...

6806
03:50:16,890 --> 03:50:18,350
They're on overtime right now.

6807
03:50:19,310 --> 03:50:19,670
Uh...

6808
03:50:19,670 --> 03:50:20,130
Three...

6809
03:50:20,130 --> 03:50:22,930
Oh my god, this is a long payload match.

6810
03:50:30,550 --> 03:50:31,590
I mean...

6811
03:50:31,590 --> 03:50:32,290
League is...

6812
03:50:32,290 --> 03:50:33,590
It's a mind game too.

6813
03:50:33,810 --> 03:50:36,730
You have to have strong mental to play League for ten fucking years.

6814
03:50:39,450 --> 03:50:40,210
Anyone.

6815
03:50:40,770 --> 03:50:42,030
Or just be like...

6816
03:50:42,030 --> 03:50:42,670
Not...

6817
03:50:42,670 --> 03:50:43,530
Like be a robot.

6818
03:50:44,010 --> 03:50:44,350
Like...

6819
03:50:45,890 --> 03:50:47,350
Or be like...

6820
03:50:47,350 --> 03:50:49,630
A genetically engineered superhuman.

6821
03:50:50,030 --> 03:50:50,510
Uh...

6822
03:50:50,510 --> 03:50:51,310
Made in Korea.

6823
03:50:53,990 --> 03:50:54,750
Uh...

6824
03:50:55,910 --> 03:50:57,870
To be able to play...

6825
03:50:57,870 --> 03:51:00,130
Play League for ten plus years.

6826
03:51:03,950 --> 03:51:04,630
Yeah.

6827
03:51:05,250 --> 03:51:05,570
Yeah.

6828
03:51:05,610 --> 03:51:06,270
Baker is like...

6829
03:51:06,270 --> 03:51:07,350
A genetically...

6830
03:51:07,350 --> 03:51:07,870
Uh...

6831
03:51:07,870 --> 03:51:09,090
Engineered superhuman being.

6832
03:51:09,210 --> 03:51:11,150
Like the perfect League being engineered.

6833
03:51:11,570 --> 03:51:12,890
Just to be like...

6834
03:51:12,890 --> 03:51:15,070
A really good League of Legends player.

6835
03:51:19,270 --> 03:51:21,490
I refuse to believe that...

6836
03:51:22,150 --> 03:51:23,770
He was not like...

6837
03:51:23,770 --> 03:51:24,870
He was not...

6838
03:51:24,870 --> 03:51:25,530
Like...

6839
03:51:25,530 --> 03:51:26,270
Like...

6840
03:51:26,270 --> 03:51:27,330
You know how like...

6841
03:51:27,330 --> 03:51:28,190
Okay...

6842
03:51:28,190 --> 03:51:29,530
What's that show called?

6843
03:51:29,530 --> 03:51:30,090
The Boys.

6844
03:51:30,450 --> 03:51:30,990
Where...

6845
03:51:31,630 --> 03:51:33,450
Homelander was created...

6846
03:51:33,450 --> 03:51:35,430
For the sake of being a superhero.

6847
03:51:35,790 --> 03:51:39,990
They created him for the sake of being the best League of Legends player in the world.

6848
03:51:46,430 --> 03:51:48,410
Even Faker has human limitations.

6849
03:51:48,410 --> 03:51:49,670
I don't believe it.

6850
03:51:50,010 --> 03:51:51,710
Give me one example where he...

6851
03:51:53,510 --> 03:51:55,350
Where he has made a mistake.

6852
03:51:55,350 --> 03:51:56,470
Where he...

6853
03:51:58,090 --> 03:51:59,750
The Lab Crone League player.

6854
03:51:59,930 --> 03:52:00,490
He's so...

6855
03:52:00,490 --> 03:52:01,590
He's so good.

6856
03:52:02,010 --> 03:52:03,010
It's hard to believe.

6857
03:52:03,010 --> 03:52:03,770
He's just...

6858
03:52:03,770 --> 03:52:04,770
Really, really good.

6859
03:52:04,970 --> 03:52:05,950
At what he does.

6860
03:52:13,050 --> 03:52:14,170
He missed...

6861
03:52:14,170 --> 03:52:16,050
Jungle Creeps as Zing.

6862
03:52:16,170 --> 03:52:18,610
I have no idea what that even means.

6863
03:52:18,670 --> 03:52:21,650
But it feels like you've been holding on to that for years.

6864
03:52:21,670 --> 03:52:22,650
This was like a...

6865
03:52:22,650 --> 03:52:25,330
A fun fact that you've kept in your head...

6866
03:52:25,330 --> 03:52:26,310
For so long.

6867
03:52:26,590 --> 03:52:29,370
Waiting for the perfect opportunity to bring it up.

6868
03:52:30,750 --> 03:52:32,050
That's so...

6869
03:52:32,050 --> 03:52:33,550
That's so specific.

6870
03:52:34,530 --> 03:52:36,490
That's incredibly specific.

6871
03:52:37,390 --> 03:52:39,410
For like his one weakness.

6872
03:52:40,170 --> 03:52:40,930
You're like...

6873
03:52:40,930 --> 03:52:41,710
Oh my God.

6874
03:52:41,770 --> 03:52:43,070
This is my time to shot.

6875
03:52:43,290 --> 03:52:43,710
Finally.

6876
03:52:44,130 --> 03:52:44,830
Someone...

6877
03:52:44,830 --> 03:52:46,610
I can finally bring it up.

6878
03:52:46,910 --> 03:52:48,250
This was his moment.

6879
03:52:57,350 --> 03:53:01,290
This probably happened seven years ago.

6880
03:53:10,460 --> 03:53:12,000
Pepperidge Farms remembers.

6881
03:53:13,340 --> 03:53:15,660
His life-flop mission is complete.

6882
03:53:15,940 --> 03:53:17,040
He can leave.

6883
03:53:17,340 --> 03:53:17,840
He is...

6884
03:53:17,840 --> 03:53:19,300
He can go home now.

6885
03:53:20,860 --> 03:53:24,220
He can finally leave purgatory and go to heaven.

6886
03:53:24,680 --> 03:53:26,800
The one thing he wanted to say.

6887
03:53:28,160 --> 03:53:28,880
What is this?

6888
03:53:29,000 --> 03:53:29,900
This is...

6889
03:53:29,900 --> 03:53:30,240
Ten's team.

6890
03:53:30,340 --> 03:53:31,260
Ten's team might win this.

6891
03:53:31,260 --> 03:53:32,620
Oh, Ten's team is winning this.

6892
03:53:33,160 --> 03:53:34,160
There's no way they don't.

6893
03:53:34,180 --> 03:53:35,900
Unless like the Bucky kills all five.

6894
03:53:37,140 --> 03:53:38,060
So Summon's...

6895
03:53:38,060 --> 03:53:39,780
Yeah, Summon's team is getting knocked out.

6896
03:53:42,200 --> 03:53:44,140
Oh, the Squirrel Girl team won.

6897
03:53:47,020 --> 03:53:48,380
The Squirrel Girl team won.

6898
03:53:48,380 --> 03:53:50,320
Now they have to play against Necros.

6899
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:52,360
It's a lot.

6900
03:53:56,260 --> 03:53:57,500
Oh my God.

6901
03:53:58,240 --> 03:53:58,720
Finally.

6902
03:53:59,220 --> 03:53:59,400
Yeah.

6903
03:54:00,660 --> 03:54:01,400
Ten's team won.

6904
03:54:02,040 --> 03:54:02,820
Ten's team won.

6905
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:03,180
Yeah.

6906
03:54:03,600 --> 03:54:04,080
Yo what's up guys.

6907
03:54:04,360 --> 03:54:04,820
Yo guys.

6908
03:54:06,500 --> 03:54:07,180
What's good, bro.

6909
03:54:07,780 --> 03:54:09,000
Gotta keep it a book with you guys.

6910
03:54:09,160 --> 03:54:10,700
I might be lagging during this match.

6911
03:54:10,960 --> 03:54:11,940
Wait, what?

6912
03:54:12,660 --> 03:54:14,460
I might be lagging heavy this week.

6913
03:54:14,860 --> 03:54:15,900
Like in the head or what?

6914
03:54:16,260 --> 03:54:20,700
Oh no, my internet is probably gonna disconnect.

6915
03:54:21,300 --> 03:54:22,800
And I might hit because of it.

6916
03:54:23,020 --> 03:54:23,040
Sorry.

6917
03:54:23,740 --> 03:54:24,720
Oh, duh!

6918
03:54:26,220 --> 03:54:28,420
Tyler, I saw the venom swing off the map, bro.

6919
03:54:28,580 --> 03:54:30,000
I had tears in my eyes watching that.

6920
03:54:30,120 --> 03:54:31,740
Dude, I told you I fucking grieved.

6921
03:54:32,260 --> 03:54:34,120
You didn't say a fucking word.

6922
03:54:34,380 --> 03:54:34,800
Yeah, I grieved.

6923
03:54:34,820 --> 03:54:35,480
Guys, my bad.

6924
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:39,820
That was so fucking funny.

6925
03:54:45,460 --> 03:54:47,600
Do payload games usually take that long?

6926
03:54:48,480 --> 03:54:49,800
That one lasted a while.

6927
03:54:50,100 --> 03:54:50,660
They could be quick.

6928
03:54:51,060 --> 03:54:53,060
No, they were just on overtime, too.

6929
03:54:53,360 --> 03:54:54,540
That was a nail biter.

6930
03:54:55,100 --> 03:54:58,620
Yeah, they were on overtime, so it just was long because of it.

6931
03:55:02,380 --> 03:55:08,620
So, like, is... Wait, why is it just your ISP being, like...

6932
03:55:09,560 --> 03:55:10,540
Like, bad?

6933
03:55:13,320 --> 03:55:15,500
There is a pause button.

6934
03:55:15,600 --> 03:55:16,840
There is a pause button.

6935
03:55:17,660 --> 03:55:18,840
Okay, I'll pause it.

6936
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:19,420
Yeah.

6937
03:55:29,640 --> 03:55:30,540
Are we in the lobby?

6938
03:55:31,040 --> 03:55:31,680
We're just waiting.

6939
03:55:32,160 --> 03:55:32,320
Not yet.

6940
03:55:32,600 --> 03:55:32,800
Not yet.

6941
03:55:32,800 --> 03:55:32,800
Yeah.

6942
03:55:33,280 --> 03:55:34,320
They're just gonna invite us.

6943
03:55:35,320 --> 03:55:38,140
Lydia, how did cloak and dagger go for you?

6944
03:55:38,140 --> 03:55:40,420
It was really bad, if I'm being honest.

6945
03:55:40,680 --> 03:55:41,360
I'm so sorry.

6946
03:55:41,620 --> 03:55:43,220
It went, like, really bad.

6947
03:55:43,700 --> 03:55:45,160
We'll just run triple tank, then.

6948
03:55:45,300 --> 03:55:47,460
If we have to go triple tank...

6949
03:55:48,520 --> 03:55:51,200
If she's banned on rocket, then we'll run triple tank.

6950
03:55:51,400 --> 03:55:54,220
And then we'll rely on me and Bliss on main heals.

6951
03:55:54,900 --> 03:55:55,300
Yeah.

6952
03:55:57,500 --> 03:55:59,520
And then, we just gotta ban Wolverine.

6953
03:55:59,640 --> 03:56:00,760
We have to ban Wolverine.

6954
03:56:01,880 --> 03:56:02,960
Wait, who plays Wolverine on the team?

6955
03:56:03,180 --> 03:56:06,440
No, I meant, like, if we run triple tank, we have to ban Wolverine.

6956
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:06,860
Aww.

6957
03:56:14,440 --> 03:56:16,100
I think, uh...

6958
03:56:16,740 --> 03:56:20,360
Honestly, I feel like they're gonna ban our res comp.

6959
03:56:22,320 --> 03:56:23,060
They might.

6960
03:56:23,380 --> 03:56:23,420
They might.

6961
03:56:23,440 --> 03:56:25,180
I think they're gonna ban it.

6962
03:56:25,600 --> 03:56:26,980
If they ban our res comp, we'll just...

6963
03:56:26,980 --> 03:56:30,060
Just play three regular healers.

6964
03:56:31,620 --> 03:56:32,140
Yeah.

6965
03:56:32,800 --> 03:56:33,940
You can do Punisher Rocket.

6966
03:56:34,460 --> 03:56:34,980
Right?

6967
03:56:36,060 --> 03:56:39,960
Uh, they might ban that too.

6968
03:56:40,540 --> 03:56:41,240
I think...

6969
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:44,220
Hulk Namor just coax, bro.

6970
03:56:45,800 --> 03:56:46,060
Okay.

6971
03:56:46,560 --> 03:56:46,820
Hulk Namor, yeah.

6972
03:56:47,400 --> 03:56:48,300
I really feel...

6973
03:56:48,300 --> 03:56:49,900
And honestly, I feel like if I stayed...

6974
03:56:49,900 --> 03:56:55,200
I feel like if I maybe even stayed the Namor on the Necro scheme, we might have even won, actually.

6975
03:56:55,740 --> 03:56:56,000
Mm-hmm.

6976
03:56:56,000 --> 03:56:58,080
Shit was so fucking good.

6977
03:56:58,880 --> 03:57:00,080
Like, they didn't know what to do against it.

6978
03:57:01,160 --> 03:57:06,100
And then he, like, stayed on Iron Fist for, like, the longest time, because we swapped off Namor.

6979
03:57:06,780 --> 03:57:09,840
I think we ban Groot first, always, against this team.

6980
03:57:10,020 --> 03:57:11,280
Protect Rocket, obviously.

6981
03:57:11,980 --> 03:57:13,240
Other sending invites.

6982
03:57:13,980 --> 03:57:14,960
Protect Rocket.

6983
03:57:16,360 --> 03:57:20,080
Ban either Lunar or Cap, maybe, on the next one.

6984
03:57:20,700 --> 03:57:23,580
Um, if Punisher isn't banned, we protect Punisher.

6985
03:57:23,880 --> 03:57:24,600
But who's first banned?

6986
03:57:24,900 --> 03:57:26,140
Um, Groot, always.

6987
03:57:26,600 --> 03:57:26,780
Groot?

6988
03:57:26,860 --> 03:57:26,980
Okay.

6989
03:57:27,440 --> 03:57:27,580
Yeah.

6990
03:57:27,640 --> 03:57:30,960
And then, if they ban Punisher, we protect Hulk.

6991
03:57:31,240 --> 03:57:36,680
And then we'll ban, uh, Cap or Emma probably last, I think.

6992
03:57:38,540 --> 03:57:41,740
I mean, we could, I mean, Tyler was okay on Groot.

6993
03:57:41,940 --> 03:57:42,580
Because if they ban...

6994
03:57:42,580 --> 03:57:43,560
But then, like...

6995
03:57:43,560 --> 03:57:44,880
No, you don't give X a secret.

6996
03:57:45,200 --> 03:57:46,360
Yeah, I don't wanna give X a secret.

6997
03:57:46,360 --> 03:57:46,620
Oh, okay.

6998
03:57:46,940 --> 03:57:47,440
Yeah, we could give X a secret.

6999
03:57:47,440 --> 03:57:48,500
You did not give X a secret.

7000
03:57:51,320 --> 03:57:52,720
Like, he actually plays that character.

7001
03:57:57,460 --> 03:57:58,520
We get the first...

7002
03:57:58,520 --> 03:58:00,040
Oh, we don't get first banned, though.

7003
03:58:00,640 --> 03:58:01,560
They get the first ban.

7004
03:58:07,240 --> 03:58:07,640
Um...

7005
03:58:07,640 --> 03:58:08,600
What were we saying?

7006
03:58:08,860 --> 03:58:11,220
Oh, we're on Team B's side, so we're not first banned.

7007
03:58:11,620 --> 03:58:12,020
So we have...

7008
03:58:12,680 --> 03:58:14,500
So they might try and ban Rocket first.

7009
03:58:15,580 --> 03:58:16,620
Or Res Comp.

7010
03:58:16,940 --> 03:58:17,780
Whatever they do.

7011
03:58:18,560 --> 03:58:21,620
Yeah, well, both teams get the first ban and then a Protect happens.

7012
03:58:22,760 --> 03:58:23,160
None of it.

7013
03:58:23,160 --> 03:58:23,300
Yeah.

7014
03:58:25,500 --> 03:58:28,320
But yeah, I'm assuming they'll ban Atom first, for sure.

7015
03:58:28,620 --> 03:58:28,860
Yeah.

7016
03:58:29,780 --> 03:58:30,480
That or Star Lord.

7017
03:58:30,640 --> 03:58:31,160
One of the two.

7018
03:58:32,060 --> 03:58:34,240
Because I don't think they wanna play against...

7019
03:58:34,240 --> 03:58:35,220
Res Comp.

7020
03:58:39,880 --> 03:58:40,540
Oh, okay.

7021
03:58:41,020 --> 03:58:41,580
This is...

7022
03:58:41,580 --> 03:58:43,400
Everything's on the line here.

7023
03:58:43,660 --> 03:58:44,680
So we don't get eliminated.

7024
03:58:46,440 --> 03:58:47,440
We're on...

7025
03:58:47,440 --> 03:58:48,360
Midtown.

7026
03:58:48,680 --> 03:58:49,400
For this.

7027
03:58:50,480 --> 03:58:50,980
Okay.

7028
03:58:53,080 --> 03:58:54,420
I guess because both teams...

7029
03:58:54,420 --> 03:58:55,240
Be aware.

7030
03:58:56,360 --> 03:58:56,720
Midtown.

7031
03:58:57,000 --> 03:58:57,440
We're aware.

7032
03:59:01,480 --> 03:59:02,200
Play Midtown.

7033
03:59:02,680 --> 03:59:04,480
I'm trying to think what support would be good for Midtown.

7034
03:59:04,620 --> 03:59:07,460
If I can play Luna, I guess Luna's good at Midtown and then there's Loki.

7035
03:59:07,640 --> 03:59:09,960
Bro, some teams are practicing in Quick Play right now.

7036
03:59:10,380 --> 03:59:10,860
Maybe we should...

7037
03:59:10,860 --> 03:59:12,000
We should've...

7038
03:59:12,000 --> 03:59:12,300
Oh, yeah.

7039
03:59:12,420 --> 03:59:13,220
I guess we should've.

7040
03:59:13,660 --> 03:59:14,460
That's smart.

7041
03:59:16,340 --> 03:59:16,740
Yeah.

7042
03:59:17,740 --> 03:59:18,540
That's actually...

7043
03:59:18,540 --> 03:59:18,800
I mean...

7044
03:59:18,800 --> 03:59:20,780
Necro's just even literally practicing right now in Quick Play.

7045
03:59:20,980 --> 03:59:21,280
Oh my...

7046
03:59:21,280 --> 03:59:22,820
They want that 250k.

7047
03:59:23,220 --> 03:59:24,080
They want that shit hard.

7048
03:59:24,080 --> 03:59:25,860
I can't blame them.

7049
03:59:26,020 --> 03:59:27,400
I can't blame them.

7050
03:59:27,560 --> 03:59:27,720
Yeah.

7051
03:59:28,200 --> 03:59:28,840
I can't blame them.

7052
03:59:28,840 --> 03:59:29,440
Nobody knows.

7053
03:59:36,190 --> 03:59:37,110
Oh, geez.

7054
03:59:38,630 --> 03:59:39,190
Are we all ready?

7055
03:59:39,510 --> 03:59:40,190
Is there anyone here?

7056
03:59:40,590 --> 03:59:41,190
I'm ready.

7057
03:59:41,830 --> 03:59:42,050
Yeah.

7058
03:59:42,130 --> 03:59:42,840
That's just...

7059
03:59:43,510 --> 03:59:44,270
Lydia here?

7060
03:59:44,830 --> 03:59:45,250
Yup.

7061
03:59:45,370 --> 03:59:45,690
I'm ready.

7062
03:59:45,830 --> 03:59:46,050
I'm ready.

7063
03:59:46,510 --> 03:59:48,350
I'm literally just praying so hard.

7064
03:59:48,350 --> 03:59:49,150
They don't mind rocket.

7065
03:59:49,670 --> 03:59:50,010
Nope.

7066
03:59:51,430 --> 03:59:51,910
Let's see.

7067
03:59:51,950 --> 03:59:52,170
No, no.

7068
03:59:52,550 --> 03:59:53,230
They're gonna...

7069
03:59:53,230 --> 03:59:54,290
They've probably even been out in first.

7070
03:59:54,330 --> 03:59:54,870
I think...

7071
03:59:54,870 --> 03:59:54,890
Yeah.

7072
03:59:54,950 --> 03:59:56,390
I don't think they want to play against Res Comp.

7073
03:59:56,570 --> 03:59:57,710
It's like...

7074
03:59:57,710 --> 03:59:58,730
Not that fun.

7075
04:00:05,330 --> 04:00:05,750
Alright.

7076
04:00:06,870 --> 04:00:07,950
Let's freaking go.

7077
04:00:10,470 --> 04:00:12,110
So we don't have to go over time.

7078
04:00:16,330 --> 04:00:16,750
Ugh!

7079
04:00:18,350 --> 04:00:19,610
So just to confirm...

7080
04:00:19,610 --> 04:00:20,150
We played these...

7081
04:00:20,150 --> 04:00:21,210
We played them before, right?

7082
04:00:21,610 --> 04:00:21,810
Yeah.

7083
04:00:21,930 --> 04:00:22,350
Yeah, we did.

7084
04:00:23,170 --> 04:00:24,030
We pummeled them.

7085
04:00:24,170 --> 04:00:25,050
We pummeled them.

7086
04:00:25,330 --> 04:00:25,510
That was...

7087
04:00:25,510 --> 04:00:26,250
We pummeled them.

7088
04:00:26,390 --> 04:00:27,830
That was the first game you had rocket.

7089
04:00:28,890 --> 04:00:29,150
Yeah.

7090
04:00:29,410 --> 04:00:29,870
Nice, nice.

7091
04:00:32,670 --> 04:00:33,070
Ooh.

7092
04:00:33,630 --> 04:00:35,230
We're just waiting for XQC's team.

7093
04:00:36,970 --> 04:00:37,370
R, guys.

7094
04:00:37,550 --> 04:00:38,030
Why would they R?

7095
04:00:45,870 --> 04:00:47,010
Come on, R.

7096
04:00:48,610 --> 04:00:50,330
He has to go back to his kid.

7097
04:00:50,630 --> 04:00:51,570
It has to like, R.

7098
04:00:54,310 --> 04:00:54,750
Oh,

7099
04:01:05,710 --> 04:01:06,210
he R'd.

7100
04:01:06,450 --> 04:01:06,970
Oh, here we go.

7101
04:01:07,310 --> 04:01:07,910
Let's go.

7102
04:01:08,350 --> 04:01:08,850
Let's go.

7103
04:01:09,050 --> 04:01:09,130
Here we go.

7104
04:01:09,130 --> 04:01:09,850
That's what we waited for.

7105
04:01:09,990 --> 04:01:12,550
Baby, show fucking time, fucking load!

7106
04:01:14,490 --> 04:01:15,590
So you be in Groot first?

7107
04:01:16,350 --> 04:01:17,550
Yes, always, always.

7108
04:01:17,930 --> 04:01:18,330
Alrighty.

7109
04:01:18,510 --> 04:01:18,890
I got it.

7110
04:01:21,590 --> 04:01:23,050
Not trying to be nervous here.

7111
04:01:23,410 --> 04:01:25,990
I wasn't nervous during the round robin because it's like...

7112
04:01:25,990 --> 04:01:28,370
It's just, you know, it's just round robin.

7113
04:01:28,390 --> 04:01:28,970
Especially on this map, too.

7114
04:01:29,110 --> 04:01:30,730
Holy fuck, Groot is like Thanos on this map.

7115
04:01:31,050 --> 04:01:31,130
Yeah.

7116
04:01:32,150 --> 04:01:35,810
Look, this is like...

7117
04:01:36,250 --> 04:01:37,010
Yup, yup.

7118
04:01:37,350 --> 04:01:39,590
This is the actual...

7119
04:01:41,590 --> 04:01:42,450
Anything but rocket.

7120
04:01:43,390 --> 04:01:44,590
Oh, nice.

7121
04:01:44,970 --> 04:01:45,810
Okay, that's fine.

7122
04:01:46,050 --> 04:01:46,470
Yeah, nice.

7123
04:01:48,070 --> 04:01:49,110
There's the atom band.

7124
04:01:50,210 --> 04:01:51,070
And it protect rocket.

7125
04:01:52,090 --> 04:01:52,310
Yup.

7126
04:01:54,570 --> 04:01:55,950
They might protect Hawkeye.

7127
04:01:56,510 --> 04:01:58,250
There's only three bands for...

7128
04:01:58,250 --> 04:01:58,430
That's fine.

7129
04:01:58,430 --> 04:01:59,970
There's only three bands for...

7130
04:02:01,210 --> 04:02:01,690
Um...

7131
04:02:01,690 --> 04:02:02,230
Tournament mode.

7132
04:02:02,350 --> 04:02:04,710
Because it's a tournament, this only exists in tournament mode.

7133
04:02:04,890 --> 04:02:04,970
Yup.

7134
04:02:06,530 --> 04:02:06,910
That's fine.

7135
04:02:07,110 --> 04:02:08,350
We protect rocket.

7136
04:02:08,910 --> 04:02:09,390
Okay.

7137
04:02:09,930 --> 04:02:11,790
Witch heroes will get my cosmic...

7138
04:02:11,790 --> 04:02:13,430
I mean, that's kinda so fucking strong.

7139
04:02:13,690 --> 04:02:14,450
I'm not surprised.

7140
04:02:15,930 --> 04:02:16,290
Um...

7141
04:02:16,290 --> 04:02:17,030
I'm gonna...

7142
04:02:17,030 --> 04:02:17,670
I'm gonna ban Luna.

7143
04:02:17,770 --> 04:02:19,250
I literally, like, denied...

7144
04:02:19,250 --> 04:02:20,650
Several ults at that item, too.

7145
04:02:23,110 --> 04:02:23,470
Go for it.

7146
04:02:23,490 --> 04:02:24,570
Yeah, I can just play...

7147
04:02:24,570 --> 04:02:25,710
Loki or Sue.

7148
04:02:26,070 --> 04:02:26,990
Depending on what they play.

7149
04:02:27,570 --> 04:02:28,130
Or cloak.

7150
04:02:29,110 --> 04:02:29,470
Oh!

7151
04:02:30,050 --> 04:02:30,950
Wait, they don't know!

7152
04:02:31,070 --> 04:02:31,810
They don't know!

7153
04:02:33,290 --> 04:02:33,970
Wait a minute.

7154
04:02:34,050 --> 04:02:35,310
They fear the Tonka Venom.

7155
04:02:35,470 --> 04:02:35,830
Uh oh.

7156
04:02:36,110 --> 04:02:37,910
Yeah, but they don't know he's good at Groot and Hulk.

7157
04:02:38,350 --> 04:02:39,590
Well, we did ban Groot.

7158
04:02:39,770 --> 04:02:40,370
I am gonna Hulk.

7159
04:02:40,370 --> 04:02:40,630
Oh, yeah.

7160
04:02:40,750 --> 04:02:41,230
Yeah, Hulk.

7161
04:02:43,410 --> 04:02:44,210
I mean...

7162
04:02:45,010 --> 04:02:46,610
I'm just thinking, do we protect Hulk then?

7163
04:02:46,830 --> 04:02:47,870
So, in case they ban it?

7164
04:02:49,330 --> 04:02:50,110
No, I don't know.

7165
04:02:50,250 --> 04:02:50,390
It's fine.

7166
04:02:50,630 --> 04:02:51,630
I can play Thing, too.

7167
04:02:52,330 --> 04:02:52,510
Oh, okay.

7168
04:02:52,770 --> 04:02:53,630
Thing will be fine.

7169
04:02:54,310 --> 04:02:54,390
Okay.

7170
04:02:54,730 --> 04:02:56,770
I'm protecting Punisher, banning Mag...

7171
04:02:56,770 --> 04:02:57,350
Okay.

7172
04:02:58,450 --> 04:02:58,710
Yeah.

7173
04:03:08,520 --> 04:03:09,320
Banning Mag...

7174
04:03:10,420 --> 04:03:11,560
I'm worried about this Hawkeye.

7175
04:03:11,660 --> 04:03:12,520
Maybe I have to go Cap.

7176
04:03:13,080 --> 04:03:13,220
Maybe?

7177
04:03:13,680 --> 04:03:14,020
Oh, Loki.

7178
04:03:14,440 --> 04:03:14,520
Cap or Emma.

7179
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:15,280
Okay.

7180
04:03:16,800 --> 04:03:17,160
Um...

7181
04:03:18,200 --> 04:03:18,560
Okay.

7182
04:03:19,200 --> 04:03:19,560
Um...

7183
04:03:19,560 --> 04:03:21,060
I'm gonna start...

7184
04:03:21,640 --> 04:03:23,180
Cause we're on offense first, right?

7185
04:03:23,980 --> 04:03:24,340
So...

7186
04:03:24,340 --> 04:03:26,660
Help Herbie scan all the lost pages.

7187
04:03:26,660 --> 04:03:28,500
I don't know if I wanna play Strange, actually.

7188
04:03:28,760 --> 04:03:29,080
Maybe I just go...

7189
04:03:29,080 --> 04:03:29,640
Am I gonna Hulk, guys?

7190
04:03:30,100 --> 04:03:30,620
Oh, yeah.

7191
04:03:30,880 --> 04:03:31,860
Emma's just giga broken.

7192
04:03:32,120 --> 04:03:32,680
Yeah, I'm going Emma.

7193
04:03:33,780 --> 04:03:34,140
Um...

7194
04:03:34,140 --> 04:03:34,960
Bliss, what do you wanna play?

7195
04:03:35,060 --> 04:03:35,860
I'll just play around you.

7196
04:03:36,640 --> 04:03:38,280
Uh, I was gonna play around you, actually.

7197
04:03:38,280 --> 04:03:38,760
Oh, no.

7198
04:03:38,840 --> 04:03:39,060
It's fine.

7199
04:03:39,120 --> 04:03:40,480
I can play any of the sports.

7200
04:03:41,300 --> 04:03:41,720
If...

7201
04:03:41,720 --> 04:03:45,280
If XQC or anyone goes Cap, I'm just gonna camp the backline.

7202
04:03:45,400 --> 04:03:45,820
I'm gonna...

7203
04:03:45,820 --> 04:03:46,540
Yeah, exactly.

7204
04:03:46,840 --> 04:03:47,040
Exactly.

7205
04:03:47,780 --> 04:03:48,780
That's why I think...

7206
04:03:48,780 --> 04:03:50,040
Cause I think they are gonna go Cap.

7207
04:03:50,300 --> 04:03:52,320
So I think you playing Emma here is like...

7208
04:03:52,320 --> 04:03:52,800
Alright.

7209
04:03:53,060 --> 04:03:53,680
I'll just sit in.

7210
04:03:54,760 --> 04:03:55,860
We didn't ask to be heroes.

7211
04:03:56,060 --> 04:03:58,020
But we always answer the call.

7212
04:04:01,820 --> 04:04:02,260
Alright.

7213
04:04:03,820 --> 04:04:04,500
And just...

7214
04:04:04,500 --> 04:04:06,320
Just let me know whenever you want me to Zed.

7215
04:04:06,320 --> 04:04:06,960
Um...

7216
04:04:06,960 --> 04:04:07,580
Cause I never know.

7217
04:04:07,900 --> 04:04:08,220
Like...

7218
04:04:08,220 --> 04:04:08,340
Yeah.

7219
04:04:08,480 --> 04:04:08,600
Okay.

7220
04:04:09,180 --> 04:04:10,040
I'll call for it, for sure.

7221
04:04:10,180 --> 04:04:10,640
Just follow Gil.

7222
04:04:10,960 --> 04:04:11,800
That's all you have to do.

7223
04:04:12,580 --> 04:04:13,560
I'll boost you, too.

7224
04:04:14,620 --> 04:04:15,380
Alright, so...

7225
04:04:15,380 --> 04:04:16,840
Should I play differently with Hulk?

7226
04:04:17,840 --> 04:04:18,160
Um...

7227
04:04:18,160 --> 04:04:19,680
Yeah, Hulk, you basically just like...

7228
04:04:19,680 --> 04:04:21,220
Jump in, harass a little bit, jump back out.

7229
04:04:21,320 --> 04:04:21,340
Oh, did I put down E?

7230
04:04:21,340 --> 04:04:22,880
Don't ever commit your health full too much.

7231
04:04:23,140 --> 04:04:23,640
Oh, uh...

7232
04:04:23,640 --> 04:04:24,540
You can put it down still.

7233
04:04:24,720 --> 04:04:25,660
It was just cause like...

7234
04:04:25,660 --> 04:04:26,900
The elevator, you're not...

7235
04:04:26,900 --> 04:04:27,620
You can't really do it.

7236
04:04:28,480 --> 04:04:28,880
Four...

7237
04:04:28,880 --> 04:04:29,420
Three...

7238
04:04:29,420 --> 04:04:30,060
A little more!

7239
04:04:30,240 --> 04:04:30,880
Let's go, team!

7240
04:04:31,620 --> 04:04:31,760
Yep.

7241
04:04:32,620 --> 04:04:32,840
Alright.

7242
04:04:33,620 --> 04:04:34,700
Maybe I can catch him up here.

7243
04:04:34,780 --> 04:04:35,300
Oh, yeah, it's Paylor.

7244
04:04:36,440 --> 04:04:37,580
Is it Penny?

7245
04:04:38,200 --> 04:04:38,600
Oh...

7246
04:04:38,600 --> 04:04:39,660
Oh, that's interesting.

7247
04:04:39,980 --> 04:04:40,640
Penny Strange.

7248
04:04:42,180 --> 04:04:43,700
Wait, they're just playing so far back?

7249
04:04:43,840 --> 04:04:44,320
What is this?

7250
04:04:44,660 --> 04:04:45,120
Wait, they're...

7251
04:04:45,620 --> 04:04:46,600
I got the rocket beacon.

7252
04:04:46,760 --> 04:04:47,740
What the hell is going on?

7253
04:04:49,160 --> 04:04:50,360
They're so far back.

7254
04:04:51,240 --> 04:04:52,260
Yeah, they're giving us so much space.

7255
04:04:52,280 --> 04:04:52,900
Wait, I can grab Strange here.

7256
04:04:52,980 --> 04:04:53,180
I'm going in.

7257
04:04:53,740 --> 04:04:54,000
Strange?

7258
04:04:54,540 --> 04:04:54,980
Yeah, help.

7259
04:04:55,180 --> 04:04:55,680
Strange is low.

7260
04:04:56,220 --> 04:04:57,240
Can you see...

7261
04:04:57,240 --> 04:04:57,980
In front, in front?

7262
04:04:58,180 --> 04:04:58,340
ZZ?

7263
04:05:00,220 --> 04:05:00,500
I...

7264
04:05:00,500 --> 04:05:01,300
Put some a bit closer.

7265
04:05:02,000 --> 04:05:02,540
Yeah, yeah.

7266
04:05:02,660 --> 04:05:02,920
Can you see?

7267
04:05:05,300 --> 04:05:06,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7268
04:05:07,220 --> 04:05:07,460
Thank you.

7269
04:05:09,840 --> 04:05:10,480
I pushed him.

7270
04:05:10,660 --> 04:05:10,880
Pull him back.

7271
04:05:11,240 --> 04:05:11,520
Nice.

7272
04:05:12,580 --> 04:05:13,280
I'm gonna push him too.

7273
04:05:13,400 --> 04:05:13,900
Help, help, help.

7274
04:05:14,100 --> 04:05:14,680
Tyler, I have Tyler.

7275
04:05:14,960 --> 04:05:15,540
I'm going in.

7276
04:05:15,660 --> 04:05:16,180
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

7277
04:05:18,680 --> 04:05:19,500
You're all out of the corner.

7278
04:05:19,620 --> 04:05:19,800
I'm pushing.

7279
04:05:19,900 --> 04:05:21,360
All out, all out, all out, all out.

7280
04:05:21,620 --> 04:05:22,080
Hawkeye won.

7281
04:05:22,200 --> 04:05:22,620
Hawkeye won.

7282
04:05:22,760 --> 04:05:23,120
Strange low, strange low.

7283
04:05:23,320 --> 04:05:23,580
Okay, nice.

7284
04:05:25,340 --> 04:05:25,820
Strange low, strange low.

7285
04:05:25,880 --> 04:05:26,220
Nice, nice.

7286
04:05:27,360 --> 04:05:28,240
I'm pushing, I'm pushing hard.

7287
04:05:28,420 --> 04:05:29,960
I'm getting the mines.

7288
04:05:30,600 --> 04:05:31,240
I got the mines.

7289
04:05:31,320 --> 04:05:31,660
I got the mines.

7290
04:05:31,900 --> 04:05:32,080
I got the mines.

7291
04:05:32,360 --> 04:05:33,040
Penny low, Penny low.

7292
04:05:33,200 --> 04:05:33,380
I'm pushing.

7293
04:05:33,540 --> 04:05:33,960
I'm just pushing.

7294
04:05:35,440 --> 04:05:36,620
Breaking res, beacon res, beacon dead.

7295
04:05:36,780 --> 04:05:37,580
I have ult really soon.

7296
04:05:38,180 --> 04:05:38,940
Okay, I have ult as well.

7297
04:05:40,640 --> 04:05:41,820
There's a Punisher on the left.

7298
04:05:42,260 --> 04:05:43,560
I'm just gonna go early when I get it, okay?

7299
04:05:45,040 --> 04:05:45,560
Portal, portal.

7300
04:05:46,900 --> 04:05:47,300
I'm ulting.

7301
04:05:49,780 --> 04:05:51,200
I'm pulling a lot of them in.

7302
04:05:52,320 --> 04:05:54,000
This is huge, it's a big ult, massive ult.

7303
04:05:54,360 --> 04:05:55,540
Yeah, I'm trying to go ult.

7304
04:05:55,760 --> 04:05:56,600
I have my ult.

7305
04:05:57,960 --> 04:05:59,020
Just ult, just ult, just ult.

7306
04:06:00,940 --> 04:06:01,860
Oh, he didn't win.

7307
04:06:03,400 --> 04:06:06,080
Yeah, I think I might be speaking too.

7308
04:06:07,220 --> 04:06:08,340
I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

7309
04:06:09,500 --> 04:06:12,240
I think when I ult, we should have just pushed hard.

7310
04:06:12,680 --> 04:06:15,160
Yeah, I was close to my ult.

7311
04:06:15,180 --> 04:06:17,120
I didn't have it just yet though, so I couldn't really follow up with you.

7312
04:06:17,620 --> 04:06:20,880
We'll do... Blizz's ult first, because it's an aggressive ult.

7313
04:06:21,540 --> 04:06:22,700
And they still have a flank.

7314
04:06:23,580 --> 04:06:25,080
Yeah, Tyler's behind them.

7315
04:06:25,120 --> 04:06:25,520
Are you okay?

7316
04:06:26,380 --> 04:06:27,600
Oh no, we need to push, maybe.

7317
04:06:28,600 --> 04:06:29,160
Heard, heard, heard.

7318
04:06:30,460 --> 04:06:31,860
I'm backing up, just backing up.

7319
04:06:32,060 --> 04:06:32,500
Back, back, back, back.

7320
04:06:34,940 --> 04:06:37,280
We have a rest, he's res, he's res, he's res, he's res.

7321
04:06:37,940 --> 04:06:39,800
Alright, push a ult, break the pen.

7322
04:06:40,060 --> 04:06:40,920
Can you Z, can you Z up here?

7323
04:06:42,400 --> 04:06:44,320
I'm on the card here, I'm on strange, strange, strange, strange!

7324
04:06:45,860 --> 04:06:46,100
Um...

7325
04:06:46,860 --> 04:06:47,820
He's half, strange, strange low.

7326
04:06:47,980 --> 04:06:48,920
Yeah, he does, he does, he does.

7327
04:06:49,040 --> 04:06:49,420
I'm trying to...

7328
04:06:50,320 --> 04:06:52,040
I'm gonna grab strange if he ults.

7329
04:06:52,160 --> 04:06:53,200
Yeah, he's looking for it, he's looking for it.

7330
04:06:53,200 --> 04:06:54,100
He's looking for it, he is, he is, he is.

7331
04:06:54,100 --> 04:06:54,580
I missed, I missed, I missed, I missed, I missed.

7332
04:06:54,580 --> 04:06:58,600
He can ult, he can ult, he can ult.

7333
04:06:58,800 --> 04:06:59,820
I don't have my thing for him.

7334
04:07:00,140 --> 04:07:00,880
Strange one, strange one, I'm dead.

7335
04:07:01,300 --> 04:07:01,460
Strange one, strange one, I'm dead.

7336
04:07:01,800 --> 04:07:02,180
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

7337
04:07:03,140 --> 04:07:04,160
I'm dead, I'm dead.

7338
04:07:05,300 --> 04:07:06,340
Break the mines, break mines on the right.

7339
04:07:07,820 --> 04:07:09,280
I'm trying to break the mines, I broke the mines, I broke the mines.

7340
04:07:09,440 --> 04:07:09,760
Strange ulting?

7341
04:07:09,760 --> 04:07:11,280
Oh, he got res.

7342
04:07:11,540 --> 04:07:12,140
I'm dead, I'm dead.

7343
04:07:12,480 --> 04:07:12,720
Yeah.

7344
04:07:13,000 --> 04:07:13,800
I'm still alive, though.

7345
04:07:15,140 --> 04:07:15,580
Back in.

7346
04:07:16,100 --> 04:07:16,760
Punish one, punish one.

7347
04:07:17,200 --> 04:07:17,560
Unlucky.

7348
04:07:18,700 --> 04:07:19,900
We have two fights left.

7349
04:07:20,100 --> 04:07:20,580
We have two fights.

7350
04:07:21,200 --> 04:07:22,520
Okay, I can just die, I think.

7351
04:07:23,200 --> 04:07:24,140
Oh, I'm maybe dead here?

7352
04:07:26,300 --> 04:07:26,740
Oh,

7353
04:07:30,940 --> 04:07:31,420
I'm gonna live?

7354
04:07:31,980 --> 04:07:33,380
Only 60 seconds left.

7355
04:07:33,820 --> 04:07:34,820
This is last fight.

7356
04:07:35,580 --> 04:07:35,980
Yeah.

7357
04:07:36,200 --> 04:07:37,840
Unless we can solve for a change.

7358
04:07:37,840 --> 04:07:41,840
We, don't have any support...

7359
04:07:42,780 --> 04:07:43,460
They use infinite ammo.

7360
04:07:43,600 --> 04:07:45,220
just back a moment...

7361
04:07:45,220 --> 04:07:45,380
Okay.

7362
04:07:47,420 --> 04:07:48,760
Okay, Q-qm push, now Q-qm push now?

7363
04:07:49,280 --> 04:07:49,760
Yeah, yeah.

7364
04:07:49,860 --> 04:07:50,320
You don't go here?

7365
04:07:50,600 --> 04:07:51,020
I can all hear.

7366
04:07:52,440 --> 04:07:52,680
Punisher?

7367
04:07:52,940 --> 04:07:52,940
Close!

7368
04:07:54,040 --> 04:07:54,360
Left?!

7369
04:07:54,360 --> 04:07:55,220
I've got a Punisher, Punisher.

7370
04:07:55,360 --> 04:07:55,740
Keep pushing!

7371
04:07:56,060 --> 04:07:56,480
I didn't care, I didn't care.

7372
04:07:57,160 --> 04:07:57,720
I'm trying, I'm trying...

7373
04:07:57,720 --> 04:07:58,140
Freaky,

7374
04:08:02,160 --> 04:08:02,160
freaky.

7375
04:08:03,060 --> 04:08:04,500
I'm trying to keep Tyler up.

7376
04:08:04,520 --> 04:08:06,660
I'm trying to keep Tyler I'm trying my best.

7377
04:08:09,880 --> 04:08:14,260
We got one, we got one.

7378
04:08:17,900 --> 04:08:20,360
I might be fucked here.

7379
04:08:20,920 --> 04:08:21,520
Strange, maybe?

7380
04:08:22,320 --> 04:08:23,900
I'm dead, I'm dead, I couldn't do anything.

7381
04:08:25,360 --> 04:08:25,980
Can we TP?

7382
04:08:26,900 --> 04:08:27,080
No.

7383
04:08:27,260 --> 04:08:28,440
Um, no, I can't touch.

7384
04:08:30,600 --> 04:08:31,440
Oh, shit.

7385
04:08:33,360 --> 04:08:34,680
We can still full hold.

7386
04:08:35,780 --> 04:08:37,360
We just didn't really combo anything.

7387
04:08:38,380 --> 04:08:41,100
Yeah, we needed to combo the rocket up there.

7388
04:08:43,580 --> 04:08:46,100
I think, I don't know, we should keep Tyler on the hook.

7389
04:08:46,600 --> 04:08:49,260
I mean, I'm gonna be honest, I don't play anything, guys, I'm a bit bored now as well.

7390
04:08:51,340 --> 04:08:54,440
I did, like, I joined this and I get target banned, so it's just like, it is what it is.

7391
04:08:54,660 --> 04:08:54,800
We lose.

7392
04:08:55,180 --> 04:08:56,980
Uh, Wolf is open.

7393
04:08:57,560 --> 04:09:00,660
Uh, I think I just... Do you want a Wolf?

7394
04:09:01,200 --> 04:09:04,540
Maybe just solo tank it, and I go, uh, Namor with Hulk?

7395
04:09:05,440 --> 04:09:06,720
Oh, they had a crash, apparently.

7396
04:09:07,680 --> 04:09:08,620
Wait, that's, we need that, though.

7397
04:09:08,780 --> 04:09:09,240
That's actually good.

7398
04:09:09,620 --> 04:09:13,080
I think there's a pause, right?

7399
04:09:13,120 --> 04:09:14,100
There is, there should be.

7400
04:09:16,640 --> 04:09:19,060
Wait, what if, I mean, I could go...

7401
04:09:19,460 --> 04:09:21,340
I don't know, this is a tough one.

7402
04:09:23,020 --> 04:09:24,780
I think, I think you just try it, honestly.

7403
04:09:24,960 --> 04:09:25,460
Try Wolverine?

7404
04:09:25,460 --> 04:09:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

7405
04:09:26,700 --> 04:09:28,180
But then we are solo tanking Hulk.

7406
04:09:29,260 --> 04:09:31,180
Yeah, I don't really know if that's a good idea, honestly.

7407
04:09:31,460 --> 04:09:32,800
He'll be coming in 30 seconds.

7408
04:09:32,960 --> 04:09:35,240
I think I, I think I just go Emma, maybe we could thing.

7409
04:09:35,640 --> 04:09:36,140
Okay, okay.

7410
04:09:36,400 --> 04:09:37,960
Thing, thing, Emma?

7411
04:09:38,660 --> 04:09:40,560
I think he stays Hulk, he stays Hulk for Namor.

7412
04:09:40,860 --> 04:09:41,840
Okay, I'm just gonna go Emma.

7413
04:09:42,020 --> 04:09:42,860
I think, I think Emma's better.

7414
04:09:43,140 --> 04:09:43,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

7415
04:09:43,880 --> 04:09:46,200
We have to play up close, like, we have to.

7416
04:09:46,200 --> 04:09:46,740
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

7417
04:09:46,920 --> 04:09:47,480
I'm gonna be a little late.

7418
04:09:47,500 --> 04:09:47,860
Is there a guy back?

7419
04:09:48,440 --> 04:09:49,060
I hope not.

7420
04:09:49,060 --> 04:09:49,760
I don't think so.

7421
04:09:50,060 --> 04:09:50,860
I don't think so.

7422
04:09:50,860 --> 04:09:51,880
They're not pausing it.

7423
04:09:52,740 --> 04:09:54,840
I mean, XUC is a tournament, but we have to play close.

7424
04:09:54,980 --> 04:09:56,200
We can't lift in there so much space.

7425
04:09:56,200 --> 04:09:56,940
Yeah, I'm holding on this corner.

7426
04:09:57,060 --> 04:09:58,240
We gotta take as many places as possible.

7427
04:09:58,320 --> 04:09:58,860
Yeah, we have to take.

7428
04:09:58,860 --> 04:10:00,720
If we lose early, maybe I'll go strange.

7429
04:10:01,220 --> 04:10:01,340
Yeah.

7430
04:10:01,540 --> 04:10:01,680
Okay.

7431
04:10:03,180 --> 04:10:04,200
Okay, so what should I be doing?

7432
04:10:05,000 --> 04:10:08,820
Oh, just kind of like, sort of play frontline with me, and like, make sure you're always charging a jump ready to get out.

7433
04:10:09,220 --> 04:10:10,380
I have to play up close too.

7434
04:10:11,920 --> 04:10:12,200
Yeah.

7435
04:10:13,600 --> 04:10:15,380
We have to shoot a Hawkeye as best we can.

7436
04:10:16,400 --> 04:10:18,120
They use infinite Emma, I'm gonna back hold it, back hold it.

7437
04:10:19,160 --> 04:10:20,500
Hiding here, yeah, yeah, and then we push after this.

7438
04:10:20,660 --> 04:10:20,840
Okay.

7439
04:10:20,840 --> 04:10:21,400
It's much better.

7440
04:10:21,860 --> 04:10:23,800
Okay, I'm gonna go three, two, one, I'm walking in.

7441
04:10:26,520 --> 04:10:28,120
I'm just like hard harassing.

7442
04:10:28,460 --> 04:10:28,840
That's good.

7443
04:10:29,620 --> 04:10:30,700
Try and kill the Hawkeye.

7444
04:10:30,860 --> 04:10:31,600
He has to die.

7445
04:10:31,980 --> 04:10:32,780
I'm trying to keep you up.

7446
04:10:32,800 --> 04:10:33,340
I'm trying to keep you up.

7447
04:10:33,480 --> 04:10:33,800
Right now.

7448
04:10:35,240 --> 04:10:36,060
Strange one, strange one.

7449
04:10:36,140 --> 04:10:37,400
Strange one, strange one, strange one.

7450
04:10:37,460 --> 04:10:38,300
Can we break mines?

7451
04:10:38,340 --> 04:10:38,700
Nice, nice, nice.

7452
04:10:39,020 --> 04:10:39,740
I'm breaking mines with you.

7453
04:10:39,820 --> 04:10:40,400
I'm breaking mines with you.

7454
04:10:40,560 --> 04:10:41,500
Careful, Tyler, careful, Tyler.

7455
04:10:42,000 --> 04:10:42,460
I pushed him.

7456
04:10:42,540 --> 04:10:42,740
You're good.

7457
04:10:43,020 --> 04:10:43,560
Plenty, plenty, plenty.

7458
04:10:45,100 --> 04:10:45,820
They're full team.

7459
04:10:45,840 --> 04:10:46,440
They're full team now.

7460
04:10:46,500 --> 04:10:47,080
They're full team now.

7461
04:10:48,640 --> 04:10:49,520
I'm trying to break the beacon.

7462
04:10:49,700 --> 04:10:49,980
Yeah.

7463
04:10:51,780 --> 04:10:52,060
Good.

7464
04:10:53,980 --> 04:10:56,280
I have my... I might have my old fresh so I'll go mine.

7465
04:10:56,600 --> 04:10:57,220
Oh wait never mind.

7466
04:10:57,740 --> 04:10:58,500
That's fine, that's fine.

7467
04:10:58,820 --> 04:10:59,880
I think we have to try and hold anyway.

7468
04:11:00,140 --> 04:11:00,400
Yeah, yeah.

7469
04:11:00,680 --> 04:11:00,840
I'm back.

7470
04:11:01,120 --> 04:11:01,760
Oh, your res are good.

7471
04:11:02,200 --> 04:11:02,700
Yeah, I'm res.

7472
04:11:03,080 --> 04:11:03,220
We're good.

7473
04:11:03,220 --> 04:11:03,280
We're good.

7474
04:11:03,400 --> 04:11:04,000
Tyler, back up.

7475
04:11:04,080 --> 04:11:04,560
Back up if you can.

7476
04:11:04,940 --> 04:11:05,520
Money block for you.

7477
04:11:06,260 --> 04:11:06,340
Okay.

7478
04:11:07,440 --> 04:11:09,380
Strange, strange, strange, strange.

7479
04:11:11,600 --> 04:11:12,100
Go to the top.

7480
04:11:12,180 --> 04:11:12,580
He's up top, please.

7481
04:11:13,180 --> 04:11:13,600
Strange one.

7482
04:11:14,540 --> 04:11:16,000
I'm focused on... I'm ulting this.

7483
04:11:16,080 --> 04:11:16,440
I'm ulting this.

7484
04:11:17,520 --> 04:11:18,720
Break it, break it, break it, break it.

7485
04:11:20,440 --> 04:11:22,080
I'm breaking it, I broke it, I broke it.

7486
04:11:23,300 --> 04:11:24,140
Punisher one, Punisher one.

7487
04:11:24,280 --> 04:11:25,120
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

7488
04:11:27,540 --> 04:11:27,960
We're fine.

7489
04:11:28,160 --> 04:11:28,680
Someone's out here.

7490
04:11:29,040 --> 04:11:30,120
I'm at the top, up top, up top, up top.

7491
04:11:32,100 --> 04:11:33,320
Control the Hawkeye, we win the game.

7492
04:11:33,880 --> 04:11:35,520
Yeah, I'm literally watching over it, don't worry.

7493
04:11:37,020 --> 04:11:39,880
Do you want me to play with you, Gail, or should Blast play with you?

7494
04:11:40,980 --> 04:11:42,580
I'm playing with my tanks.

7495
04:11:42,840 --> 04:11:45,240
Okay, let me know when Thor goes on you, I'll grab him, we kill.

7496
04:11:45,240 --> 04:11:45,800
Okay.

7497
04:11:47,240 --> 04:11:48,800
Strange has ult, though, so I gotta watch for that, too.

7498
04:11:49,480 --> 04:11:51,140
I'm gonna ult this, actually, when we break Strange.

7499
04:11:51,140 --> 04:11:51,900
I'm gonna ult this, actually, when we break Strange.

7500
04:11:51,900 --> 04:11:52,080
Careful.

7501
04:11:52,920 --> 04:11:53,780
I'm gonna ult, can you guys ready to fight?

7502
04:11:53,900 --> 04:11:54,200
Ready for fight?

7503
04:11:54,880 --> 04:11:55,100
Yeah.

7504
04:11:57,400 --> 04:11:57,880
Oh, no.

7505
04:11:59,060 --> 04:11:59,400
Ulti be can!

7506
04:11:59,560 --> 04:12:00,760
Oh, no, I was gonna say.

7507
04:12:01,140 --> 04:12:01,660
Ulti be can.

7508
04:12:02,900 --> 04:12:03,920
I couldn't see him.

7509
04:12:04,560 --> 04:12:05,800
Do I go strange here, or do I wait?

7510
04:12:07,480 --> 04:12:08,040
I think...

7511
04:12:08,540 --> 04:12:09,660
We don't need to be just yet, I think.

7512
04:12:10,360 --> 04:12:10,500
Yeah, yeah.

7513
04:12:10,500 --> 04:12:10,720
Yeah, yeah.

7514
04:12:12,340 --> 04:12:12,900
Stay Emma.

7515
04:12:13,180 --> 04:12:13,320
It's fine.

7516
04:12:14,120 --> 04:12:15,320
We gotta take a really, really fight, then.

7517
04:12:15,800 --> 04:12:18,140
So we can have a strange... They're trying to choke us out here.

7518
04:12:18,360 --> 04:12:18,960
We need to walk up.

7519
04:12:19,140 --> 04:12:19,440
I'm here with you.

7520
04:12:19,440 --> 04:12:19,820
I'm here with you.

7521
04:12:21,740 --> 04:12:23,460
We should start with... start with Blizz ult.

7522
04:12:23,820 --> 04:12:24,380
Start with Blizz ult.

7523
04:12:25,220 --> 04:12:25,820
I'm gonna ult us up.

7524
04:12:27,800 --> 04:12:29,040
Okay, walk hard, then.

7525
04:12:29,160 --> 04:12:29,780
Everyone walk hard.

7526
04:12:29,960 --> 04:12:30,420
Yeah, walk hard.

7527
04:12:30,660 --> 04:12:34,180
Should I ult?

7528
04:12:34,280 --> 04:12:34,720
Should I ult?

7529
04:12:35,420 --> 04:12:35,700
Wait.

7530
04:12:36,120 --> 04:12:36,660
Wait a sec.

7531
04:12:36,660 --> 04:12:37,720
No, no, no, no, no.

7532
04:12:37,720 --> 04:12:39,220
No, no, no, no.

7533
04:12:39,660 --> 04:12:40,840
I grab my grab my hook!

7534
04:12:42,100 --> 04:12:42,860
I'm gonna get B.

7535
04:12:43,100 --> 04:12:43,980
Throw in the back, throw in the back.

7536
04:12:44,480 --> 04:12:44,700
I will.

7537
04:12:47,940 --> 04:12:48,660
I can't.

7538
04:12:48,980 --> 04:12:49,520
I'm dead.

7539
04:12:50,140 --> 04:12:50,960
We have to TP.

7540
04:12:51,740 --> 04:12:52,940
No, wait.

7541
04:12:53,120 --> 04:12:56,740
Stay on cart, you have to save.

7542
04:12:57,240 --> 04:12:57,640
Stay on cart, I'm gonna TP.

7543
04:12:57,640 --> 04:12:58,020
I'm going for TP.

7544
04:13:00,960 --> 04:13:01,620
Awww.

7545
04:13:03,040 --> 04:13:04,520
Oh my god.

7546
04:13:05,700 --> 04:13:06,220
Holy fuck.

7547
04:13:07,920 --> 04:13:10,340
What the fuck did I join this dog shit for?

7548
04:13:11,100 --> 04:13:12,000
Hey, GGs, guys.

7549
04:13:12,160 --> 04:13:12,440
It was fun.

7550
04:13:12,600 --> 04:13:13,460
Nice meeting you guys.

7551
04:13:14,660 --> 04:13:15,060
GGs.

7552
04:13:16,380 --> 04:13:16,780
GGs.

7553
04:13:17,760 --> 04:13:18,160
GGs.

7554
04:13:18,400 --> 04:13:18,640
GGs.

7555
04:13:18,800 --> 04:13:18,840
GGs.

7556
04:13:18,840 --> 04:13:19,080
GGs.

7557
04:13:20,060 --> 04:13:21,700
Oh, man.

7558
04:13:24,900 --> 04:13:25,820
Let's try, guys.

7559
04:13:26,020 --> 04:13:26,640
Yeah, let's try.

7560
04:13:26,880 --> 04:13:27,780
I think it was bad.

7561
04:13:27,840 --> 04:13:28,920
I think it's just bad in line.

7562
04:13:30,080 --> 04:13:31,900
It was literally a bad line thing.

7563
04:13:32,520 --> 04:13:34,460
Honestly, this has got to be a captain problem.

7564
04:13:34,920 --> 04:13:36,280
This is a captain problem.

7565
04:13:37,680 --> 04:13:38,560
What happened?

7566
04:13:40,320 --> 04:13:41,380
Oh, jeez.

7567
04:13:41,540 --> 04:13:43,100
No, it was Caster's Curse.

7568
04:13:43,160 --> 04:13:44,340
That guy jinxed us.

7569
04:13:44,800 --> 04:13:46,900
I think the mag band might have been trolled, maybe.

7570
04:13:48,000 --> 04:13:48,840
How am I sure?

7571
04:13:49,280 --> 04:13:50,960
I think if I played mag, I'd just carry.

7572
04:13:53,340 --> 04:13:53,780
Tough.

7573
04:13:54,620 --> 04:13:57,020
They also banned the Venom, which is brutal.

7574
04:13:57,240 --> 04:13:57,540
Yeah.

7575
04:13:58,140 --> 04:13:58,680
For Tyler.

7576
04:13:59,820 --> 04:14:00,220
Yeah.

7577
04:14:00,600 --> 04:14:04,020
I think, honestly, it's just... It really... I don't know if it was a band line.

7578
04:14:04,060 --> 04:14:06,780
It just came down to... We just didn't combo our stuff.

7579
04:14:06,780 --> 04:14:07,260
That's true.

7580
04:14:07,420 --> 04:14:07,800
That too.

7581
04:14:08,000 --> 04:14:08,200
Yeah.

7582
04:14:08,460 --> 04:14:14,560
We didn't do... I think just one simple rock adult with Punisher ult together, we would have just... Yeah.

7583
04:14:15,120 --> 04:14:15,780
It's all good, though.

7584
04:14:16,180 --> 04:14:16,580
Sorry.

7585
04:14:16,980 --> 04:14:17,940
I just... It's okay.

7586
04:14:17,940 --> 04:14:18,960
It's my reaction time.

7587
04:14:19,180 --> 04:14:20,340
It's like... I don't want to all...

7588
04:14:20,340 --> 04:14:21,020
Like, wrong.

7589
04:14:21,400 --> 04:14:26,340
And then... And then when I've heard you guys say it, and then I think about... You know, and I... I'm... I'm... Yeah.

7590
04:14:26,640 --> 04:14:26,720
It's okay.

7591
04:14:26,900 --> 04:14:27,320
It's okay.

7592
04:14:27,620 --> 04:14:27,620
It's okay.

7593
04:14:27,620 --> 04:14:29,880
It's like a lot of... It's really overwhelming, too.

7594
04:14:30,040 --> 04:14:30,160
Yeah.

7595
04:14:30,300 --> 04:14:30,440
It's super hectic.

7596
04:14:30,440 --> 04:14:31,120
It's super hectic, for sure.

7597
04:14:31,980 --> 04:14:32,380
Yeah.

7598
04:14:32,440 --> 04:14:32,440
Yeah.

7599
04:14:32,500 --> 04:14:34,640
It's overwhelming, because, like, a tournament play is... But thank you, Super for...

7600
04:14:34,640 --> 04:14:37,060
... because, like, a tournament play is, like, much more intense than normal.

7601
04:14:38,160 --> 04:14:38,560
Yeah.

7602
04:14:39,440 --> 04:14:40,000
For sure.

7603
04:14:40,160 --> 04:14:40,280
Nice try.

7604
04:14:40,600 --> 04:14:41,140
Nice try.

7605
04:14:41,620 --> 04:14:41,880
Yeah.

7606
04:14:42,480 --> 04:14:44,060
Thank you, Super for picking me, as well.

7607
04:14:44,240 --> 04:14:44,600
Yeah.

7608
04:14:44,700 --> 04:14:44,840
Yeah.

7609
04:14:45,000 --> 04:14:47,980
I was... I was for sure expecting to be, like, fully lost back.

7610
04:14:49,660 --> 04:14:51,120
Nah, it's... It's chill.

7611
04:14:51,320 --> 04:14:52,000
We had fun.

7612
04:14:52,140 --> 04:14:52,800
That's all that matters.

7613
04:14:53,080 --> 04:14:53,500
Yeah, it's nice.

7614
04:14:53,720 --> 04:14:53,880
Yeah.

7615
04:14:53,880 --> 04:14:55,040
We had fun.

7616
04:14:55,120 --> 04:14:57,000
Well, everybody gets money in it.

7617
04:14:58,060 --> 04:14:58,080
You guys were a strong team.

7618
04:14:58,080 --> 04:14:59,320
You... You... You guys did well.

7619
04:14:59,500 --> 04:15:01,880
I wouldn't... I wouldn't go into the weekend holding your heads down.

7620
04:15:02,100 --> 04:15:02,680
You did really well.

7621
04:15:02,680 --> 04:15:02,680
Yes!

7622
04:15:03,120 --> 04:15:03,420
Yes!

7623
04:15:03,960 --> 04:15:07,780
Um, but we do... We do appreciate you guys joining us.

7624
04:15:08,080 --> 04:15:09,260
That was... That was super fun.

7625
04:15:09,580 --> 04:15:12,720
Um, I believe you guys are in fifth slash sixth.

7626
04:15:13,300 --> 04:15:13,420
Yeah.

7627
04:15:13,480 --> 04:15:13,740
Okay.

7628
04:15:14,540 --> 04:15:18,740
Um, we'll... We'll get the, you know, uh, prizing details sorted after the fact.

7629
04:15:19,020 --> 04:15:20,480
Uh, we'll be in touch with all of you individually.

7630
04:15:20,840 --> 04:15:23,280
But, again, really appreciate you joining us for this.

7631
04:15:23,280 --> 04:15:24,220
We had a blast.

7632
04:15:24,760 --> 04:15:27,440
Um, but you're good to go whenever... Whenever you want to head out.

7633
04:15:28,220 --> 04:15:28,900
Sounds good.

7634
04:15:29,080 --> 04:15:29,600
Thank you.

7635
04:15:29,980 --> 04:15:30,840
Yeah, GG's.

7636
04:15:31,220 --> 04:15:31,620
GG's.

7637
04:15:31,640 --> 04:15:32,040
GG's.

7638
04:15:32,180 --> 04:15:32,300
GG's, guys.

7639
04:15:32,760 --> 04:15:33,440
Hope you had fun.

7640
04:15:33,600 --> 04:15:33,760
GG's.

7641
04:15:33,880 --> 04:15:34,240
GG's.

7642
04:15:34,240 --> 04:15:36,560
It's half midnight for me, so I'm gonna go to bed, but...

7643
04:15:36,560 --> 04:15:38,620
Thank you guys very much, but...

7644
04:15:38,620 --> 04:15:38,620
Yep.

7645
04:15:38,880 --> 04:15:40,260
You're all so nice, bro.

7646
04:15:40,340 --> 04:15:43,960
I literally... Jeff ulted my team at the start.

7647
04:15:43,980 --> 04:15:46,700
And, like, no one even said anything mean, so I really appreciate it.

7648
04:15:47,800 --> 04:15:48,300
All good.

7649
04:15:48,580 --> 04:15:49,260
It's fun.

7650
04:15:49,840 --> 04:15:50,240
GG's.

7651
04:15:50,240 --> 04:15:52,340
It's just a... It's a fun tournament.

7652
04:15:52,660 --> 04:15:53,180
It's for fun.

7653
04:15:53,340 --> 04:15:54,580
It's not like...

7654
04:15:54,580 --> 04:15:54,980
True.

7655
04:15:55,540 --> 04:15:55,740
Yeah.

7656
04:15:55,980 --> 04:15:56,240
True, true, true.

7657
04:15:58,440 --> 04:15:58,940
Alright.

7658
04:15:59,360 --> 04:15:59,740
Okay.

7659
04:15:59,960 --> 04:16:00,680
I'll see you guys later.

7660
04:16:00,680 --> 04:16:00,700
See ya.

7661
04:16:00,700 --> 04:16:01,300
I'll see you guys.

7662
04:16:01,740 --> 04:16:02,280
Bye, guys.

7663
04:16:02,960 --> 04:16:03,160
Yep.

7664
04:16:03,160 --> 04:16:03,160
Yep.

7665
04:16:03,160 --> 04:16:03,320
Peace.

7666
04:16:05,000 --> 04:16:06,280
That was unfortunate.

7667
04:16:06,820 --> 04:16:08,400
That was actually... That was so unfortunate.

7668
04:16:08,580 --> 04:16:09,440
We were not...

7669
04:16:09,440 --> 04:16:14,540
We didn't combo... I think... We didn't combo anything in the end.

7670
04:16:14,540 --> 04:16:18,620
And that was, like, basically... I think I was, like, MVP at one point for the longest time.

7671
04:16:20,060 --> 04:16:20,460
Uh...

7672
04:16:20,460 --> 04:16:20,820
Yeah.

7673
04:16:20,820 --> 04:16:22,820
It was unfortunate that it was single elimination.

7674
04:16:22,960 --> 04:16:24,820
And they target banned Tyler.

7675
04:16:25,160 --> 04:16:28,100
So, like, there was nothing we could really do there.

7676
04:16:28,540 --> 04:16:31,700
I... I... I personally think we should have swapped Tyler one off of Hulk.

7677
04:16:31,700 --> 04:16:34,980
I don't think that was putting him on Hulk, was it?

7678
04:16:35,360 --> 04:16:36,460
But that was my opinion.

7679
04:16:38,500 --> 04:16:38,980
Um...

7680
04:16:38,980 --> 04:16:39,440
Yeah.

7681
04:16:40,380 --> 04:16:40,860
Uh...

7682
04:16:40,860 --> 04:16:41,180
Yeah.

7683
04:16:41,340 --> 04:16:43,540
They... It was... I think that was not it.

7684
04:16:43,680 --> 04:16:45,900
We... We should have put him in something else.

7685
04:16:46,140 --> 04:16:48,980
And I think it's because it was, like, really late for Lydia, too.

7686
04:16:49,960 --> 04:16:52,380
Uh... She... It got really late for her.

7687
04:16:52,700 --> 04:16:56,700
So, for her, it was a struggle to combo with Gale, too.

7688
04:16:57,920 --> 04:17:00,740
Uh... I think Thing would have been so much better, honestly.

7689
04:17:02,000 --> 04:17:06,540
Um... I tried to figure out where the Strange was, because I knew he was gonna ult, and I shouldn't have bunched up.

7690
04:17:06,620 --> 04:17:09,500
I didn't remember that all my... I was, like, calling out a support.

7691
04:17:09,560 --> 04:17:13,200
I didn't think everybody was around me, because I had to stay up close to heal...

7692
04:17:13,200 --> 04:17:18,940
Heal, uh... I thought, like, Bliss... Bliss and, uh, Lydia were on high ground.

7693
04:17:19,760 --> 04:17:21,600
And... Because, like, Gale was on high ground.

7694
04:17:21,820 --> 04:17:27,160
So, I thought Bliss and Lydia were both on high ground, because I stayed on the low ground to heal my tanks.

7695
04:17:27,400 --> 04:17:29,180
Because I... I trust my own positioning.

7696
04:17:29,760 --> 04:17:31,240
And I have... I was on Sue.

7697
04:17:31,460 --> 04:17:33,620
So on Sue, you can heal both tanks really well.

7698
04:17:34,560 --> 04:17:36,560
You can heal both tanks non-stop.

7699
04:17:37,920 --> 04:17:41,740
Yeah, so I should have called them to be like, don't play near me.

7700
04:17:41,820 --> 04:17:43,040
I should have called that up.

7701
04:17:44,700 --> 04:17:46,240
And be like, don't play near me.

7702
04:17:46,400 --> 04:17:49,200
Like, because I was clearly not positioned correctly.

7703
04:17:49,660 --> 04:17:52,760
But I didn't think my other supports were also with me.

7704
04:17:52,840 --> 04:17:54,800
Because I was like, Gale, do you want me to play high ground with you?

7705
04:17:54,860 --> 04:17:56,560
And then I saw Bliss go upstairs.

7706
04:17:56,900 --> 04:17:58,240
So then I was like, okay, it's fine.

7707
04:17:58,240 --> 04:17:59,300
I don't have to play high ground.

7708
04:17:59,480 --> 04:18:01,140
Because if I was on high ground, we would have won.

7709
04:18:01,340 --> 04:18:06,380
We would have... if I was on high ground and ulted, I could have been... we could have saved that.

7710
04:18:06,580 --> 04:18:09,920
Because like, I mispositioned myself so I could keep my tanks up.

7711
04:18:10,040 --> 04:18:12,780
Because I didn't want to go high ground because I was scared of the Hawkeye.

7712
04:18:14,420 --> 04:18:16,400
Just because like, the Hawkeye has a...

7713
04:18:16,400 --> 04:18:18,020
I was scared the Hawkeye was going to get me.

7714
04:18:20,500 --> 04:18:20,860
Yeah.

7715
04:18:21,980 --> 04:18:24,660
So I should have called them out to not be near me.

7716
04:18:24,760 --> 04:18:27,680
Because that was like, the game winning ult for XQC there.

7717
04:18:28,240 --> 04:18:29,480
Uh, but we all did our best.

7718
04:18:29,620 --> 04:18:32,040
I think I played really, really well in general.

7719
04:18:32,060 --> 04:18:33,440
I think I played really well.

7720
04:18:33,500 --> 04:18:38,820
It was just unfortunate that we were locked in like... We were comp locked and stuff.

7721
04:18:39,480 --> 04:18:42,580
And, uh, we were locked in specific comps.

7722
04:18:42,840 --> 04:18:47,560
And people figured out how to do the ban... We had unfortunate banline.

7723
04:18:48,600 --> 04:18:50,800
Yeah, our banline was not great.

7724
04:18:50,980 --> 04:18:51,920
It's always banline.

7725
04:18:52,020 --> 04:18:53,020
I fucking hate it.

7726
04:18:53,160 --> 04:18:54,760
I fucking hate the banline thing.

7727
04:18:54,760 --> 04:18:58,660
Because the banline hurts our team.

7728
04:18:58,660 --> 04:19:04,460
Just because we have two players that can only play specific characters.

7729
04:19:04,820 --> 04:19:08,940
So if they do their research... XQC's team, they play everything.

7730
04:19:09,680 --> 04:19:18,640
Um, they don't have to deal with a banline that, uh... That, like, restricts them versus restricting us.

7731
04:19:18,640 --> 04:19:21,540
So, the banline hurts our newer players.

7732
04:19:21,540 --> 04:19:25,680
Because they didn't have time to learn the character... Like, enough characters.

7733
04:19:26,080 --> 04:19:31,400
And I had to... Basically, I just played what... Like, played whatever was... Like, whatever was most comfortable.

7734
04:19:31,760 --> 04:19:33,340
I just played as a fill.

7735
04:19:33,440 --> 04:19:33,920
As a support.

7736
04:19:34,440 --> 04:19:34,800
Yeah.

7737
04:19:38,160 --> 04:19:39,120
Yeah, so...

7738
04:19:39,980 --> 04:19:43,240
XQC's team now... Yeah, but we had... We had a Rocket 1 trick.

7739
04:19:43,240 --> 04:19:47,480
And we had... Tyler 1... That got his whole hero pool banned out.

7740
04:19:48,300 --> 04:19:49,720
Literally just target those two.

7741
04:19:49,980 --> 04:19:51,940
And we used our target banline.

7742
04:19:52,140 --> 04:19:54,360
We used our banline on...

7743
04:19:54,360 --> 04:19:56,700
Uh, we used our banline on...

7744
04:19:56,700 --> 04:19:57,260
XQC.

7745
04:19:57,800 --> 04:19:59,420
Um, instead of, like...

7746
04:19:59,420 --> 04:20:01,620
Because they didn't have... They didn't have a 1 trick.

7747
04:20:01,880 --> 04:20:02,500
That's the thing.

7748
04:20:02,780 --> 04:20:04,720
They didn't have a 1 trick on them.

7749
04:20:04,880 --> 04:20:07,520
We can't ban Rocket because we had a Rocket 1 trick.

7750
04:20:08,980 --> 04:20:11,020
Yeah, so we had to...

7751
04:20:11,640 --> 04:20:12,160
Uh...

7752
04:20:12,160 --> 04:20:15,040
Yeah, they target specifically the newer players.

7753
04:20:15,180 --> 04:20:16,860
Because we can't target their newer players.

7754
04:20:17,140 --> 04:20:17,620
Because...

7755
04:20:17,620 --> 04:20:20,560
Their newer players could play all the supports that they can.

7756
04:20:20,860 --> 04:20:21,680
But we only had...

7757
04:20:23,820 --> 04:20:24,300
Uh...

7758
04:20:24,300 --> 04:20:25,480
We only... We...

7759
04:20:25,480 --> 04:20:27,660
Their 1 trick plays the 1 trick.

7760
04:20:27,880 --> 04:20:29,500
Their 1 trick is our 1 trick.

7761
04:20:29,620 --> 04:20:30,960
So we can't ban Rocket.

7762
04:20:31,380 --> 04:20:31,540
Yeah.

7763
04:20:34,600 --> 04:20:40,140
Wait, Lydia is also a Rocket one-trick, so we can't ban one... we can't ban Rocket.

7764
04:20:40,720 --> 04:20:44,560
The moment we put Lydia off of Rocket, like, she's very uncomfortable.

7765
04:20:46,020 --> 04:20:46,580
Yeah.

7766
04:20:47,500 --> 04:20:53,040
So, like, we can't target the one-tricks, but, like, they could target our... they could target our weak players.

7767
04:20:53,320 --> 04:20:57,980
Because we... their weak players are supports, but we can't do that to us.

7768
04:20:57,980 --> 04:21:02,120
Because, like, our weak players is...

7769
04:21:02,780 --> 04:21:07,320
Because that only leaves us one weak player to target, and that's their other support.

7770
04:21:07,640 --> 04:21:11,220
But, like, we can't do that, because we have three support players.

7771
04:21:13,440 --> 04:21:16,720
We have... we have three support players.

7772
04:21:17,000 --> 04:21:19,460
They also protect Hawkeye right off the bat.

7773
04:21:20,040 --> 04:21:22,800
They were either gonna protect Hawkeye or protect Groot.

7774
04:21:23,020 --> 04:21:24,740
So, like, um...

7775
04:21:24,740 --> 04:21:27,820
If we protected... if we banned Hawkeye, they protect Groot.

7776
04:21:27,820 --> 04:21:29,560
If we ban Groot, they protect Hawkeye.

7777
04:21:29,940 --> 04:21:31,580
So, like, there was nothing we could do.

7778
04:21:31,880 --> 04:21:32,200
Yeah.

7779
04:21:32,740 --> 04:21:34,220
So, it's just unlucky.

7780
04:21:34,700 --> 04:21:37,800
It's always... It was just unlucky.

7781
04:21:38,180 --> 04:21:39,200
Unfortunate banline.

7782
04:21:40,080 --> 04:21:43,420
And, uh... It's just unfortunate banline.

7783
04:21:43,520 --> 04:21:45,320
But, you know, we all learn.

7784
04:21:52,700 --> 04:21:53,400
It's fine.

7785
04:21:56,120 --> 04:21:57,400
It is what it is.

7786
04:21:57,560 --> 04:21:59,840
Like, everybody... Like, we all win money in the end.

7787
04:21:59,840 --> 04:22:02,220
And I got to meet a lot of cool people.

7788
04:22:03,600 --> 04:22:04,420
Um...

7789
04:22:04,420 --> 04:22:05,880
Are you gonna go against Hawkeye, then Groot?

7790
04:22:06,300 --> 04:22:07,780
Oh, then... No.

7791
04:22:13,780 --> 04:22:14,600
Um...

7792
04:22:14,600 --> 04:22:15,900
Both are terrible.

7793
04:22:16,700 --> 04:22:21,780
Hawkeye is good... Hawkeye is really good against our weaker players.

7794
04:22:21,980 --> 04:22:24,720
Because Hawkeye punishes positioning.

7795
04:22:25,420 --> 04:22:27,880
Uh... Hawkeye punishes positioning.

7796
04:22:28,820 --> 04:22:30,100
And Groot...

7797
04:22:30,100 --> 04:22:32,540
Groot is just really good alt combo.

7798
04:22:32,940 --> 04:22:33,980
Um... In general.

7799
04:22:34,160 --> 04:22:35,500
Groot is just very oppressive.

7800
04:22:36,200 --> 04:22:37,320
Um... So, like...

7801
04:22:37,320 --> 04:22:38,580
The... It was either...

7802
04:22:38,580 --> 04:22:40,220
We get oppressed really hard.

7803
04:22:40,800 --> 04:22:41,400
Um...

7804
04:22:41,400 --> 04:22:42,160
Because of the walls.

7805
04:22:42,440 --> 04:22:44,920
Or the Hawkeye just kills our entire...

7806
04:22:44,920 --> 04:22:45,760
Like, kills our...

7807
04:22:45,760 --> 04:22:46,680
Our weaker players.

7808
04:22:47,060 --> 04:22:48,860
Like, that's why I wanted...

7809
04:22:48,860 --> 04:22:50,820
I brought up the idea of...

7810
04:22:50,820 --> 04:22:52,680
Tyler swapping off Hulk.

7811
04:22:52,680 --> 04:22:55,260
Because he was just getting shredded...

7812
04:22:55,260 --> 04:22:56,560
By Hawkeye.

7813
04:22:57,400 --> 04:22:58,120
He... Yeah.

7814
04:22:58,300 --> 04:22:58,960
He was just...

7815
04:22:58,960 --> 04:23:00,260
That's why I was like...

7816
04:23:00,260 --> 04:23:02,460
I didn't want to play...

7817
04:23:02,460 --> 04:23:03,520
I didn't want him to play Hulk.

7818
04:23:03,720 --> 04:23:05,080
Because I thought that...

7819
04:23:06,040 --> 04:23:06,520
Um...

7820
04:23:06,520 --> 04:23:08,640
I thought he was getting, like...

7821
04:23:08,640 --> 04:23:09,620
Ultra shredded...

7822
04:23:09,620 --> 04:23:11,160
By Hawkeye in general.

7823
04:23:11,460 --> 04:23:11,880
And, like...

7824
04:23:11,880 --> 04:23:13,080
I couldn't keep him up.

7825
04:23:13,400 --> 04:23:13,740
Yeah.

7826
04:23:13,940 --> 04:23:14,160
I...

7827
04:23:14,160 --> 04:23:16,600
I wanted him to swap to...

7828
04:23:16,600 --> 04:23:17,580
The thing.

7829
04:23:17,940 --> 04:23:18,320
Or something.

7830
04:23:19,160 --> 04:23:19,640
Um...

7831
04:23:19,640 --> 04:23:20,680
He was just an ult battery.

7832
04:23:20,900 --> 04:23:21,080
Yeah.

7833
04:23:21,360 --> 04:23:22,340
But I did pretty well.

7834
04:23:22,520 --> 04:23:23,860
I think...

7835
04:23:24,560 --> 04:23:25,400
I think...

7836
04:23:25,400 --> 04:23:25,480
Yeah.

7837
04:23:25,540 --> 04:23:26,360
And also I was on Sue.

7838
04:23:26,760 --> 04:23:27,760
They banned Loki.

7839
04:23:28,000 --> 04:23:28,580
That's the thing.

7840
04:23:28,680 --> 04:23:29,500
They banned Loki.

7841
04:23:29,500 --> 04:23:32,120
So it's so hard to keep tanks up.

7842
04:23:32,320 --> 04:23:33,820
When there's no Loki too.

7843
04:23:35,680 --> 04:23:36,640
And, uh...

7844
04:23:36,640 --> 04:23:37,600
Uh...

7845
04:23:37,600 --> 04:23:38,120
We couldn't.

7846
04:23:38,180 --> 04:23:39,620
If we saved Venom...

7847
04:23:39,620 --> 04:23:40,400
They banned Rocket.

7848
04:23:41,380 --> 04:23:42,120
Because what they...

7849
04:23:42,120 --> 04:23:43,500
Everybody knows we have a Rocket one trick.

7850
04:23:43,660 --> 04:23:44,080
Because, like...

7851
04:23:44,080 --> 04:23:46,360
Lydia was always talking about how she could only play Rocket.

7852
04:23:46,760 --> 04:23:47,400
And, like...

7853
04:23:47,400 --> 04:23:47,800
Everyone...

7854
04:23:47,800 --> 04:23:47,940
Like...

7855
04:23:47,940 --> 04:23:49,820
They were clearly watching our vlogs and stuff.

7856
04:23:50,660 --> 04:23:52,100
Because they targeted Tyler.

7857
04:23:52,480 --> 04:23:54,140
So they were clearly, like...

7858
04:23:54,140 --> 04:23:55,580
They were clearly, like...

7859
04:23:55,580 --> 04:23:56,900
Hard targeting...

7860
04:23:56,900 --> 04:23:57,880
Whatever, like...

7861
04:23:57,880 --> 04:23:58,780
We were trying to do.

7862
04:24:01,900 --> 04:24:02,320
Um...

7863
04:24:04,550 --> 04:24:06,390
Oh, they wouldn't ban Rocket with E-Rub.

7864
04:24:06,410 --> 04:24:06,770
That's true.

7865
04:24:06,810 --> 04:24:07,410
I didn't know that.

7866
04:24:07,410 --> 04:24:08,850
I didn't know he was a Rocket one trick.

7867
04:24:10,110 --> 04:24:10,530
Uh...

7868
04:24:10,530 --> 04:24:11,370
I didn't realize...

7869
04:24:11,370 --> 04:24:11,750
Oh, yeah.

7870
04:24:11,770 --> 04:24:12,090
I forgot.

7871
04:24:12,310 --> 04:24:13,590
They had Rocket one trick.

7872
04:24:13,770 --> 04:24:14,390
I didn't realize.

7873
04:24:14,450 --> 04:24:15,170
I wasn't researching.

7874
04:24:18,230 --> 04:24:18,630
Uh...

7875
04:24:18,630 --> 04:24:19,130
They...

7876
04:24:19,130 --> 04:24:20,290
He wasn't research...

7877
04:24:20,290 --> 04:24:21,130
I wasn't researching.

7878
04:24:21,490 --> 04:24:24,570
But I found out E-Rub was a Rocket one trick after the game.

7879
04:24:25,450 --> 04:24:26,270
Just don't be a one trick.

7880
04:24:26,370 --> 04:24:26,770
That's the thing.

7881
04:24:26,850 --> 04:24:28,150
We had players that are just new.

7882
04:24:28,350 --> 04:24:29,150
They're new players.

7883
04:24:30,050 --> 04:24:30,450
Um...

7884
04:24:30,450 --> 04:24:33,010
I think Lydia should have just focused on learning just support.

7885
04:24:34,130 --> 04:24:34,530
Um...

7886
04:24:34,530 --> 04:24:35,510
So that was just unfortunate.

7887
04:24:36,370 --> 04:24:37,170
Because, like...

7888
04:24:37,170 --> 04:24:37,690
Um...

7889
04:24:37,690 --> 04:24:37,950
Like...

7890
04:24:37,950 --> 04:24:38,890
It is what it is.

7891
04:24:38,990 --> 04:24:39,270
They were...

7892
04:24:39,270 --> 04:24:39,470
They...

7893
04:24:39,470 --> 04:24:40,330
She was a new player.

7894
04:24:40,530 --> 04:24:42,550
And she only was able to learn...

7895
04:24:42,550 --> 04:24:43,290
She was...

7896
04:24:43,290 --> 04:24:44,450
She literally just played...

7897
04:24:44,450 --> 04:24:46,210
Started playing the game this week.

7898
04:24:46,510 --> 04:24:47,830
From what I've heard.

7899
04:24:48,470 --> 04:24:51,470
She just started playing the game...

7900
04:24:51,470 --> 04:24:52,350
This week.

7901
04:24:52,830 --> 04:24:53,190
Uh...

7902
04:24:53,190 --> 04:24:55,370
So she picked up learning...

7903
04:24:55,370 --> 04:24:57,510
Thing, Rocket, and Squirrel Girl.

7904
04:24:58,270 --> 04:24:58,710
Um...

7905
04:24:58,710 --> 04:24:59,490
And then there...

7906
04:24:59,490 --> 04:25:01,570
She was positioned as the support player for our team.

7907
04:25:05,410 --> 04:25:05,850
Uh...

7908
04:25:05,850 --> 04:25:06,150
Yeah.

7909
04:25:08,550 --> 04:25:09,230
So, like...

7910
04:25:09,230 --> 04:25:10,090
It was just unfortunate.

7911
04:25:10,770 --> 04:25:12,270
Every team has one new player.

7912
04:25:12,690 --> 04:25:13,530
Every team has, like...

7913
04:25:13,530 --> 04:25:14,670
At least one new player, too.

7914
04:25:15,210 --> 04:25:15,650
So...

7915
04:25:15,650 --> 04:25:16,390
It wasn't like...

7916
04:25:16,390 --> 04:25:17,450
Our team was just imbalanced.

7917
04:25:17,610 --> 04:25:18,130
It was just...

7918
04:25:18,130 --> 04:25:19,770
Our bad line was not great.

7919
04:25:20,610 --> 04:25:21,050
Uh...

7920
04:25:21,050 --> 04:25:21,830
I don't know.

7921
04:25:21,930 --> 04:25:23,590
I don't know if I want to play a rank game.

7922
04:25:23,710 --> 04:25:24,230
Because rank...

7923
04:25:26,490 --> 04:25:27,390
I don't know.

7924
04:25:29,790 --> 04:25:30,830
That's why I...

7925
04:25:30,830 --> 04:25:32,530
I learned all the support, too.

7926
04:25:32,950 --> 04:25:33,430
Because...

7927
04:25:33,430 --> 04:25:35,070
I fucking hate the bad line.

7928
04:25:35,610 --> 04:25:35,930
I'm...

7929
04:25:35,930 --> 04:25:36,130
I...

7930
04:25:36,130 --> 04:25:36,590
I...

7931
04:25:40,270 --> 04:25:41,550
I could play one game.

7932
04:25:41,630 --> 04:25:42,650
I'll play one rank game.

7933
04:25:42,830 --> 04:25:43,970
I still have a bit...

7934
04:25:43,970 --> 04:25:45,010
Before I derank, anyway.

7935
04:25:48,190 --> 04:25:48,670
Yeah.

7936
04:25:51,030 --> 04:25:51,990
I just know...

7937
04:25:51,990 --> 04:25:52,990
I know it wasn't me.

7938
04:25:53,170 --> 04:25:54,510
I'm, like, happy with how I did.

7939
04:25:55,070 --> 04:25:55,790
Because I...

7940
04:25:55,790 --> 04:25:57,270
I personally played really well.

7941
04:25:57,390 --> 04:25:59,210
I wish we went further.

7942
04:25:59,530 --> 04:26:01,190
I did wish we went further.

7943
04:26:01,550 --> 04:26:02,430
But, like...

7944
04:26:02,430 --> 04:26:03,530
It is what it is.

7945
04:26:03,650 --> 04:26:03,810
You know?

7946
04:26:04,810 --> 04:26:05,290
Like...

7947
04:26:05,290 --> 04:26:06,570
It's a team game.

7948
04:26:07,010 --> 04:26:07,410
It's like...

7949
04:26:08,830 --> 04:26:10,190
I feel like...

7950
04:26:10,190 --> 04:26:11,250
It wasn't on me.

7951
04:26:15,030 --> 04:26:16,390
The fact that...

7952
04:26:17,230 --> 04:26:18,850
The fact that, like...

7953
04:26:19,510 --> 04:26:20,330
I could...

7954
04:26:20,330 --> 04:26:21,550
I didn't even play Luna at all.

7955
04:26:21,750 --> 04:26:22,910
And I still did really good on...

7956
04:26:22,910 --> 04:26:23,190
I...

7957
04:26:23,190 --> 04:26:24,290
Like, literally, I was just...

7958
04:26:24,290 --> 04:26:24,610
Luna.

7959
04:26:24,670 --> 04:26:25,890
I couldn't play Luna.

7960
04:26:25,890 --> 04:26:27,670
Which hero do you think you want to be to?

7961
04:26:27,670 --> 04:26:30,570
If I got to play Luna, I think I could have done a lot more for my team.

7962
04:26:40,430 --> 04:26:44,350
Who am I gonna vanish from this match?

7963
04:26:46,270 --> 04:26:47,870
Well, my team banned Luna.

7964
04:26:48,870 --> 04:26:49,710
My own...

7965
04:26:49,710 --> 04:26:51,350
My own team banned Luna.

7966
04:26:51,890 --> 04:26:53,770
But I could play any support.

7967
04:26:54,370 --> 04:26:55,230
So I was fine.

7968
04:27:04,340 --> 04:27:05,560
I was fine with it.

7969
04:27:05,680 --> 04:27:06,580
We don't have a tank player.

7970
04:27:06,580 --> 04:27:08,220
Maybe I shouldn't have Q today.

7971
04:27:10,760 --> 04:27:12,220
No, I said you can do whatever.

7972
04:27:13,360 --> 04:27:15,500
The only time I suggested a Luna ban...

7973
04:27:15,500 --> 04:27:17,320
Was when Necros was on Iron Fist.

7974
04:27:19,080 --> 04:27:21,640
Because an Iron Fist with a Luna pocket is so oppressive.

7975
04:27:21,960 --> 04:27:22,800
It's like...

7976
04:27:22,800 --> 04:27:23,300
Not fun.

7977
04:27:23,900 --> 04:27:25,700
I would know because I...

7978
04:27:26,180 --> 04:27:27,760
I played against...

7979
04:27:27,760 --> 04:27:29,040
Like, I've done that stuff.

7980
04:27:29,600 --> 04:27:30,020
In rank.

7981
04:27:37,960 --> 04:27:39,360
I don't think we have a tank player.

7982
04:27:39,440 --> 04:27:40,760
Unless Johnny Sins played tank.

7983
04:27:41,280 --> 04:27:43,660
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

7984
04:27:44,120 --> 04:27:44,900
Pick your hero.

7985
04:27:45,320 --> 04:27:45,940
Or villain.

7986
04:27:46,140 --> 04:27:46,860
I'm not judging.

7987
04:28:08,400 --> 04:28:08,900
Alright.

7988
04:28:14,450 --> 04:28:15,010
Alright.

7989
04:28:17,960 --> 04:28:18,520
Alright.

7990
04:28:19,000 --> 04:28:20,220
We have...

7991
04:28:20,220 --> 04:28:20,840
An Emma.

7992
04:28:21,140 --> 04:28:21,540
That's fine.

7993
04:28:23,300 --> 04:28:23,860
Uh...

7994
04:28:24,620 --> 04:28:26,620
I'm thinking if I should play Loki here.

7995
04:28:26,900 --> 04:28:27,940
30 seconds before you attack.

7996
04:28:28,240 --> 04:28:28,860
Get ready.

7997
04:28:30,760 --> 04:28:33,240
Maybe I should have been first picked by XQC.

7998
04:28:37,480 --> 04:28:38,000
Guys.

7999
04:28:38,440 --> 04:28:40,300
I should have been first picked.

8000
04:28:48,870 --> 04:28:52,410
Then I would have been able to be in the tournament longer.

8001
04:28:52,990 --> 04:28:54,250
When we jinxed it.

8002
04:28:54,790 --> 04:28:56,530
At least I know it wasn't...

8003
04:28:56,530 --> 04:28:58,930
At least I know it wasn't because of me though.

8004
04:28:59,690 --> 04:29:00,890
That's all that matters.

8005
04:29:08,020 --> 04:29:09,420
I still be in it.

8006
04:29:09,660 --> 04:29:10,180
That's right.

8007
04:29:10,740 --> 04:29:11,140
Fuck.

8008
04:29:11,320 --> 04:29:12,160
They have a Psylocke.

8009
04:29:17,060 --> 04:29:17,700
There you go.

8010
04:29:19,060 --> 04:29:19,480
There you go.

8011
04:29:23,320 --> 04:29:25,060
I'm trying to keep my shield up to charge.

8012
04:29:25,300 --> 04:29:26,200
So I don't have to worry about...

8013
04:29:28,520 --> 04:29:30,240
Oh my god.

8014
04:29:30,400 --> 04:29:32,460
I am trying my best.

8015
04:29:33,120 --> 04:29:34,160
I'm sorry.

8016
04:29:34,860 --> 04:29:36,060
I'm sorry.

8017
04:29:36,560 --> 04:29:38,800
I love you.

8018
04:29:39,540 --> 04:29:41,420
My shield broke.

8019
04:29:42,640 --> 04:29:44,480
My shield broke.

8020
04:29:44,740 --> 04:29:45,620
I'm sorry.

8021
04:29:46,860 --> 04:29:50,720
If we're playing three DPS, do you mind just like hooking their engages all the time?

8022
04:29:51,200 --> 04:29:51,700
Just free kills.

8023
04:29:53,460 --> 04:29:53,940
Thoughts?

8024
04:29:55,640 --> 04:29:57,180
I think I'll just go for Penny.

8025
04:29:57,760 --> 04:29:58,240
Yeah.

8026
04:29:58,420 --> 04:29:59,220
Penny cap dude.

8027
04:29:59,720 --> 04:30:00,060
Just free.

8028
04:30:01,380 --> 04:30:02,460
What the fuck?

8029
04:30:02,620 --> 04:30:02,920
That's hook.

8030
04:30:02,920 --> 04:30:03,880
What's going on?

8031
04:30:05,280 --> 04:30:06,940
I hate caps in America.

8032
04:30:07,180 --> 04:30:08,000
Caps above us.

8033
04:30:15,520 --> 04:30:17,760
I'm trying my best.

8034
04:30:18,860 --> 04:30:20,760
I'm trying my best.

8035
04:30:23,740 --> 04:30:27,360
I'm trying my best to keep my Luna alive.

8036
04:30:32,580 --> 04:30:34,980
I have to keep my shield just for our Luna, too.

8037
04:30:35,100 --> 04:30:35,860
That's the worst part.

8038
04:30:43,900 --> 04:30:44,980
Oh my god.

8039
04:30:45,760 --> 04:30:47,740
Like, there's no space at all.

8040
04:30:49,460 --> 04:30:53,440
We have no space because of this Captain America and magic.

8041
04:30:53,900 --> 04:30:54,800
I hate dive.

8042
04:30:54,920 --> 04:30:55,440
I hate dive.

8043
04:30:55,580 --> 04:30:56,100
I hate dive.

8044
04:30:56,240 --> 04:30:57,660
I hate dive.

8045
04:30:58,500 --> 04:30:59,020
I hate...

8046
04:31:00,540 --> 04:31:01,620
I hate dive.

8047
04:31:01,620 --> 04:31:03,400
I hate dive so much.

8048
04:31:06,180 --> 04:31:07,200
I hate that.

8049
04:31:09,120 --> 04:31:09,560
Okay.

8050
04:31:11,320 --> 04:31:12,220
Oh my god.

8051
04:31:12,380 --> 04:31:13,160
I'm doing my best.

8052
04:31:13,280 --> 04:31:14,000
I'm doing my best.

8053
04:31:14,160 --> 04:31:15,720
I'm doing my best to keep you up.

8054
04:31:15,860 --> 04:31:16,740
We have no tank.

8055
04:31:17,200 --> 04:31:17,560
We have...

8056
04:31:17,560 --> 04:31:18,980
We're just going to walk or we're never going to walk?

8057
04:31:21,620 --> 04:31:23,840
Guys, maybe I shouldn't have Q'd up.

8058
04:31:30,950 --> 04:31:32,990
I'm just using this as thingy.

8059
04:31:34,050 --> 04:31:34,890
Oh, I'm dead.

8060
04:31:35,430 --> 04:31:35,870
Oh.

8061
04:31:39,310 --> 04:31:41,070
We have no tanks here.

8062
04:31:42,130 --> 04:31:43,250
This is bad for me.

8063
04:31:43,670 --> 04:31:44,810
This is bad for me.

8064
04:31:45,030 --> 04:31:46,330
This is bad for me.

8065
04:31:46,430 --> 04:31:48,610
I have no one to fucking...

8066
04:31:48,610 --> 04:31:49,010
All right.

8067
04:31:53,960 --> 04:31:56,760
All the good players are doing a tournament right now.

8068
04:31:58,980 --> 04:32:01,980
There's a tournament going on right now.

8069
04:32:02,420 --> 04:32:04,920
That's where all the good players are.

8070
04:32:20,010 --> 04:32:21,540
This is fine.

8071
04:32:23,380 --> 04:32:25,240
Hard to play low-key.

8072
04:32:31,460 --> 04:32:32,240
Nice.

8073
04:32:32,720 --> 04:32:33,040
Oh.

8074
04:32:39,980 --> 04:32:40,960
Have to reload.

8075
04:32:43,020 --> 04:32:44,060
I'm gonna freeze it.

8076
04:32:45,320 --> 04:32:46,280
You freeze it?

8077
04:32:46,420 --> 04:32:47,680
I don't think he froze it.

8078
04:32:47,740 --> 04:32:49,260
I don't think he froze it, guys.

8079
04:32:49,520 --> 04:32:51,560
I don't think he froze it.

8080
04:32:55,020 --> 04:32:57,320
Guys, do you think he froze it?

8081
04:32:59,500 --> 04:33:02,840
Oh, now he did.

8082
04:33:03,020 --> 04:33:04,140
Okay, he froze it, guys.

8083
04:33:04,340 --> 04:33:04,980
He froze it.

8084
04:33:04,980 --> 04:33:06,480
I wasn't sure.

8085
04:33:06,700 --> 04:33:08,300
I wasn't sure if he did.

8086
04:33:09,100 --> 04:33:09,460
So...

8087
04:33:10,220 --> 04:33:12,580
Alright, why the fuck did we go to Squirrel Girl, though?

8088
04:33:12,820 --> 04:33:13,660
Like, I read that S.

8089
04:33:15,700 --> 04:33:18,400
Four and five, got off tank, left us with zero tanks.

8090
04:33:19,260 --> 04:33:20,880
Oh, I can be able to throw him for fun.

8091
04:33:23,720 --> 04:33:25,280
Everyone loves a trickster.

8092
04:33:25,400 --> 04:33:27,800
Until the trick is played on them.

8093
04:33:30,320 --> 04:33:32,000
Like, just go support at that point.

8094
04:33:32,140 --> 04:33:34,200
Wait, is... Oh wait, is Super playing?

8095
04:33:34,740 --> 04:33:36,400
Wait, I just... Sorry, I just realized...

8096
04:33:38,200 --> 04:33:39,960
What if I ask Super to play with me?

8097
04:33:40,060 --> 04:33:40,640
Alright, we have time.

8098
04:33:40,640 --> 04:33:41,640
We'll go early.

8099
04:33:42,380 --> 04:33:42,720
He...

8100
04:33:43,400 --> 04:33:44,520
He made us lose.

8101
04:33:44,820 --> 04:33:45,440
I should...

8102
04:33:46,500 --> 04:33:50,220
Do you think Super's down for a duo?

8103
04:33:51,220 --> 04:33:52,520
I can play more and...

8104
04:33:52,520 --> 04:33:54,060
And then we get to lose more together.

8105
04:33:59,860 --> 04:34:00,720
That's how...

8106
04:34:00,720 --> 04:34:03,520
I will de-rank him just for making us lose that tournament.

8107
04:34:06,740 --> 04:34:09,000
Ask him to Doom Q with me.

8108
04:34:09,300 --> 04:34:10,060
We're the same Yelo.

8109
04:34:10,600 --> 04:34:12,280
We can Doom Q together.

8110
04:34:12,800 --> 04:34:14,520
I have seen many futures.

8111
04:34:14,760 --> 04:34:16,500
And most of them are bad.

8112
04:34:16,880 --> 04:34:18,280
Ask him after this game.

8113
04:34:19,120 --> 04:34:20,880
I don't think we're gonna win this game.

8114
04:34:21,500 --> 04:34:22,200
Do they have a thing now?

8115
04:34:28,560 --> 04:34:29,760
Take point, take point.

8116
04:34:30,460 --> 04:34:32,100
I have many faces.

8117
04:34:35,380 --> 04:34:37,020
Oh, I see him.

8118
04:34:42,700 --> 04:34:44,220
Oh, this is bad for us.

8119
04:34:44,500 --> 04:34:45,520
I need to get off.

8120
04:34:47,120 --> 04:34:48,460
Oh, that's bad for me.

8121
04:34:49,020 --> 04:34:49,540
Alright.

8122
04:34:50,200 --> 04:34:51,000
I go sue.

8123
04:34:51,340 --> 04:34:52,940
Cause they're on Bucky now.

8124
04:34:56,240 --> 04:34:57,380
Alright, can they die quick?

8125
04:34:58,720 --> 04:35:00,360
So that's Bucky, Luna.

8126
04:35:01,340 --> 04:35:02,380
They just...

8127
04:35:02,380 --> 04:35:03,420
Ripped ults for nothing.

8128
04:35:10,750 --> 04:35:11,430
Alright.

8129
04:35:12,130 --> 04:35:12,250
Alright.

8130
04:35:12,250 --> 04:35:12,770
Oh my god.

8131
04:35:12,990 --> 04:35:13,670
That's unlucky.

8132
04:35:27,690 --> 04:35:29,470
Oh my god.

8133
04:35:30,490 --> 04:35:31,850
Oh my god.

8134
04:35:32,430 --> 04:35:33,030
Oh my god.

8135
04:35:33,710 --> 04:35:34,150
Okay.

8136
04:35:34,930 --> 04:35:35,990
That's unlucky.

8137
04:35:42,490 --> 04:35:44,890
I think this is just a team diff.

8138
04:35:48,710 --> 04:35:49,590
No elf.

8139
04:35:52,630 --> 04:35:54,210
I also gotta...

8140
04:35:54,210 --> 04:35:55,370
Remember, I'm playing higher elo now.

8141
04:35:55,370 --> 04:35:59,850
I was adjusting my playstyle in the elo I was in.

8142
04:35:59,950 --> 04:36:01,090
In the tournament I was in.

8143
04:36:01,970 --> 04:36:05,130
So like, I have to remember this is also like, highly...

8144
04:36:05,730 --> 04:36:07,150
This is like, higher elo.

8145
04:36:07,310 --> 04:36:08,690
So I have to like, actually...

8146
04:36:08,690 --> 04:36:09,110
I've been...

8147
04:36:09,110 --> 04:36:11,970
I was taking like, bad positioning and everything.

8148
04:36:12,390 --> 04:36:13,370
During that tournament.

8149
04:36:13,370 --> 04:36:15,350
For the sake of like...

8150
04:36:17,570 --> 04:36:19,110
So I'll let him...

8151
04:36:19,110 --> 04:36:20,870
I need to readjust myself too.

8152
04:36:25,470 --> 04:36:27,090
Okay, you ult first.

8153
04:36:28,430 --> 04:36:29,070
Okay.

8154
04:36:36,030 --> 04:36:38,110
I need to readjust how I play.

8155
04:36:40,090 --> 04:36:42,230
I'm definitely playing a lot...

8156
04:36:42,230 --> 04:36:43,750
A lot more...

8157
04:36:43,750 --> 04:36:46,070
Like my positioning is not that great right now.

8158
04:36:46,070 --> 04:36:47,190
I can

8159
04:36:52,010 --> 04:36:54,610
ult it.

8160
04:36:55,810 --> 04:36:56,770
Nice, nice.

8161
04:36:58,810 --> 04:36:59,610
You ready?

8162
04:36:59,850 --> 04:37:00,130
I know.

8163
04:37:00,410 --> 04:37:02,050
Damage boosting, damage boosting, damage boosting.

8164
04:37:02,630 --> 04:37:03,230
Nice.

8165
04:37:05,130 --> 04:37:06,330
Two, one...

8166
04:37:08,550 --> 04:37:09,150
Yeah.

8167
04:37:09,870 --> 04:37:10,470
Okay.

8168
04:37:15,190 --> 04:37:17,250
My thing is gonna be on here.

8169
04:37:17,830 --> 04:37:18,250
Okay, Trevor.

8170
04:37:22,710 --> 04:37:23,330
Okay.

8171
04:37:24,930 --> 04:37:25,530
Jesus Christ.

8172
04:37:27,210 --> 04:37:27,830
Oh!

8173
04:37:30,210 --> 04:37:32,130
I need to use my brain.

8174
04:37:34,990 --> 04:37:37,430
I need to use my brain in this elo.

8175
04:37:50,350 --> 04:37:52,470
I don't have my shield anymore.

8176
04:37:52,910 --> 04:37:53,910
It's not going to die.

8177
04:37:54,050 --> 04:37:55,390
Thank fucking god.

8178
04:37:56,780 --> 04:37:57,510
I can't.

8179
04:37:58,590 --> 04:37:59,310
I legitimately...

8180
04:37:59,310 --> 04:38:00,910
I don't know what to do when you're on die.

8181
04:38:02,170 --> 04:38:03,930
I don't know what to do when you're on dive.

8182
04:38:06,300 --> 04:38:07,200
Oh, I missed.

8183
04:38:07,280 --> 04:38:08,120
I missed my push.

8184
04:38:08,280 --> 04:38:09,180
You respawned, you respawned.

8185
04:38:09,340 --> 04:38:09,920
I was fucking old.

8186
04:38:10,660 --> 04:38:11,620
Oh, you're your ammo, please.

8187
04:38:13,140 --> 04:38:13,500
I'm...

8188
04:38:13,500 --> 04:38:13,920
I'm popping.

8189
04:38:15,040 --> 04:38:15,380
Wait, wait.

8190
04:38:15,580 --> 04:38:15,960
What's the mag?

8191
04:38:16,040 --> 04:38:16,340
Mag.

8192
04:38:16,340 --> 04:38:16,560
Mag.

8193
04:38:16,660 --> 04:38:16,700
Mag.

8194
04:38:16,720 --> 04:38:20,660
Oh my god.

8195
04:38:20,860 --> 04:38:21,440
I got him, I got him.

8196
04:38:24,710 --> 04:38:25,190
Oh wait.

8197
04:38:25,750 --> 04:38:26,590
Oh my god.

8198
04:38:26,890 --> 04:38:27,430
I can't.

8199
04:38:29,870 --> 04:38:30,230
Magic.

8200
04:38:32,050 --> 04:38:33,590
Where was my team?

8201
04:38:37,170 --> 04:38:38,750
Where was the team?

8202
04:38:40,390 --> 04:38:42,390
I had to deal with magic and Bucky.

8203
04:38:45,050 --> 04:38:46,870
Okay, we should just enter with Emma ult.

8204
04:38:46,890 --> 04:38:47,290
Take him back.

8205
04:38:47,470 --> 04:38:48,130
Take him back.

8206
04:38:49,350 --> 04:38:49,790
Yeah.

8207
04:38:50,070 --> 04:38:50,450
Yeah, he can.

8208
04:38:52,170 --> 04:38:53,350
They've almost got it!

8209
04:38:53,350 --> 04:38:55,250
We just enter with Emma ult.

8210
04:38:55,390 --> 04:38:55,850
Backup.

8211
04:38:55,930 --> 04:38:56,090
Backup.

8212
04:38:56,090 --> 04:38:56,470
Backup for CP.

8213
04:38:56,670 --> 04:38:57,030
Please get in.

8214
04:38:57,930 --> 04:38:58,310
Okay.

8215
04:38:59,590 --> 04:39:00,570
Inting sounds like fun.

8216
04:39:03,390 --> 04:39:03,850
Oh!

8217
04:39:18,630 --> 04:39:19,090
Okay.

8218
04:39:24,150 --> 04:39:24,830
Rockets main.

8219
04:39:24,970 --> 04:39:26,050
Rockets on their main side.

8220
04:39:29,910 --> 04:39:30,470
Okay.

8221
04:39:31,130 --> 04:39:31,690
Okay.

8222
04:39:31,770 --> 04:39:32,130
Okay, that's good.

8223
04:39:33,630 --> 04:39:34,190
Okay.

8224
04:39:35,650 --> 04:39:35,670
Okay, that's good.

8225
04:39:35,810 --> 04:39:36,370
No!

8226
04:39:37,350 --> 04:39:38,590
I couldn't do anything.

8227
04:39:38,870 --> 04:39:39,450
I had no...

8228
04:39:39,450 --> 04:39:40,290
I had no shield.

8229
04:39:40,970 --> 04:39:42,490
Oh my god.

8230
04:39:43,550 --> 04:39:44,110
Oh!

8231
04:39:44,110 --> 04:39:45,110
That's a huge maga!

8232
04:39:49,400 --> 04:39:49,960
Nice.

8233
04:39:55,380 --> 04:39:57,120
I'm coming back.

8234
04:39:57,400 --> 04:39:58,620
Can we kill Bucky?

8235
04:39:59,360 --> 04:40:02,280
I'm jumping as fast as I can!

8236
04:40:04,920 --> 04:40:06,140
Okay, nice.

8237
04:40:10,260 --> 04:40:10,680
Alright.

8238
04:40:11,580 --> 04:40:13,720
They have no strange TP.

8239
04:40:13,940 --> 04:40:14,680
They do have...

8240
04:40:17,560 --> 04:40:18,120
Nice.

8241
04:40:18,300 --> 04:40:19,000
I pushed him away.

8242
04:40:19,480 --> 04:40:19,940
In time.

8243
04:40:21,140 --> 04:40:21,320
Oh!

8244
04:40:37,500 --> 04:40:38,480
I hate dive.

8245
04:40:38,680 --> 04:40:39,200
I hate dive.

8246
04:40:39,520 --> 04:40:40,000
I hate dive.

8247
04:40:45,080 --> 04:40:46,600
I swear to god.

8248
04:40:46,600 --> 04:40:47,120
I...

8249
04:40:47,120 --> 04:40:48,020
I swear to...

8250
04:40:48,020 --> 04:40:48,640
The moment they...

8251
04:40:48,640 --> 04:40:50,220
They swapped off Captain America.

8252
04:40:50,520 --> 04:40:51,120
I think the Iron Man...

8253
04:40:51,120 --> 04:40:52,320
And it felt so good.

8254
04:41:04,660 --> 04:41:05,860
Hulk Iron Man.

8255
04:41:06,400 --> 04:41:06,660
Okay.

8256
04:41:06,880 --> 04:41:07,620
That's a lot better.

8257
04:41:08,360 --> 04:41:08,580
Oh.

8258
04:41:08,920 --> 04:41:09,400
What?

8259
04:41:09,640 --> 04:41:10,800
What do you mean?

8260
04:41:12,180 --> 04:41:12,700
No, no.

8261
04:41:12,820 --> 04:41:13,180
No hold.

8262
04:41:13,400 --> 04:41:13,640
No hold.

8263
04:41:13,980 --> 04:41:14,620
Oh, wait.

8264
04:41:14,620 --> 04:41:15,020
Is he?

8265
04:41:15,160 --> 04:41:15,340
Oh.

8266
04:41:15,720 --> 04:41:15,820
Um.

8267
04:41:15,960 --> 04:41:17,540
I have my Discord thing set up.

8268
04:41:18,840 --> 04:41:20,680
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

8269
04:41:20,840 --> 04:41:21,360
That's why.

8270
04:41:24,480 --> 04:41:26,320
Iron Man, can you just fly above me though?

8271
04:41:26,440 --> 04:41:27,320
Instead of like going in?

8272
04:41:29,320 --> 04:41:30,680
Because I'm looking up to heal you.

8273
04:41:30,880 --> 04:41:31,800
It's just sometimes you play angles.

8274
04:41:31,800 --> 04:41:32,320
I can't heal.

8275
04:41:32,960 --> 04:41:33,820
Did that put a spring in my step?

8276
04:41:34,500 --> 04:41:35,260
Someone would clap!

8277
04:41:40,780 --> 04:41:41,360
This man.

8278
04:41:42,560 --> 04:41:43,520
The magic behind.

8279
04:41:43,720 --> 04:41:44,700
Oh my god.

8280
04:41:44,820 --> 04:41:45,660
I didn't have my shield.

8281
04:41:45,660 --> 04:41:48,000
I need our Luna to be closer to me.

8282
04:41:50,000 --> 04:41:51,040
That was unlucky.

8283
04:41:51,680 --> 04:41:52,780
You were down a healer, dude.

8284
04:41:53,360 --> 04:41:54,360
I needed my...

8285
04:41:54,360 --> 04:41:55,180
Oh, Luna.

8286
04:41:55,540 --> 04:41:56,940
I needed you to be closer.

8287
04:41:58,020 --> 04:41:58,980
I literally...

8288
04:41:58,980 --> 04:42:00,160
All I need is the shield.

8289
04:42:01,880 --> 04:42:02,800
That's rocket ult.

8290
04:42:03,980 --> 04:42:04,900
Someone mark the magic.

8291
04:42:05,240 --> 04:42:05,580
Hold on.

8292
04:42:06,600 --> 04:42:07,220
We will...

8293
04:42:07,220 --> 04:42:07,300
We will...

8294
04:42:07,300 --> 04:42:07,340
We will...

8295
04:42:07,340 --> 04:42:07,360
We will...

8296
04:42:07,360 --> 04:42:07,440
We will...

8297
04:42:07,440 --> 04:42:08,500
Yeah, single mark the magic.

8298
04:42:08,780 --> 04:42:09,420
It's just...

8299
04:42:10,760 --> 04:42:11,920
We got the one shot.

8300
04:42:15,640 --> 04:42:17,100
Sirelock needs to be watching our client.

8301
04:42:17,720 --> 04:42:18,080
Okay.

8302
04:42:18,260 --> 04:42:19,300
Wanting to help us.

8303
04:42:19,520 --> 04:42:20,120
I can't...

8304
04:42:20,120 --> 04:42:21,000
I can't push shield.

8305
04:42:21,180 --> 04:42:22,480
She's on us when she's literally on.

8306
04:42:22,600 --> 04:42:23,260
It's too late then.

8307
04:42:24,160 --> 04:42:25,480
I can't use my shield on.

8308
04:42:25,600 --> 04:42:26,140
Oh my god.

8309
04:42:26,240 --> 04:42:27,460
I don't want to use my shield at all.

8310
04:42:29,660 --> 04:42:31,320
I got two on the right, two on the right, one!

8311
04:42:31,340 --> 04:42:31,980
Three on the right!

8312
04:42:32,420 --> 04:42:33,120
Indie's, you're first.

8313
04:42:33,420 --> 04:42:33,660
Nice.

8314
04:42:33,660 --> 04:42:34,820
Oh, no more, no more.

8315
04:42:34,900 --> 04:42:35,800
We don't need it, we don't need it.

8316
04:42:36,400 --> 04:42:37,920
Everyone will fucking follow me.

8317
04:42:39,520 --> 04:42:39,960
Please!

8318
04:42:42,180 --> 04:42:43,660
I needed one heal.

8319
04:42:46,900 --> 04:42:47,660
You first.

8320
04:42:48,040 --> 04:42:49,400
I don't have a...

8321
04:42:50,260 --> 04:42:51,920
Invis, you gotta save your double jump, bro.

8322
04:42:52,580 --> 04:42:53,460
What do you mean?

8323
04:42:56,160 --> 04:42:57,080
I got hit.

8324
04:42:57,500 --> 04:42:58,280
I got hit.

8325
04:42:58,980 --> 04:42:59,420
Wait.

8326
04:42:59,720 --> 04:43:01,000
Okay, I thought you just beat for a second.

8327
04:43:02,540 --> 04:43:03,660
What do you mean?

8328
04:43:03,780 --> 04:43:05,500
I was in front of her!

8329
04:43:06,140 --> 04:43:10,220
I should not have to... I should not be, like, forced to...

8330
04:43:11,560 --> 04:43:15,100
I shouldn't be forced to use double jump there.

8331
04:43:15,360 --> 04:43:16,940
Because, like, literally...

8332
04:43:17,960 --> 04:43:21,960
I feel like I shouldn't be forced to be used double though, right?

8333
04:43:25,720 --> 04:43:26,240
Right?

8334
04:43:26,700 --> 04:43:28,200
Just because, like, she was in me.

8335
04:43:31,000 --> 04:43:35,300
I shouldn't be forced to use my ability if she was, like, right behind me.

8336
04:43:35,620 --> 04:43:36,800
Alright, they have hella ults here.

8337
04:43:36,920 --> 04:43:37,600
Like, a lot of ults.

8338
04:43:39,460 --> 04:43:40,340
I'm ulting first.

8339
04:43:40,700 --> 04:43:41,320
I think they have 5 ults here.

8340
04:43:41,560 --> 04:43:42,980
Invis, I'm ulting first.

8341
04:43:43,280 --> 04:43:43,400
Third?

8342
04:43:43,660 --> 04:43:44,340
Insta-burn-in.

8343
04:43:44,560 --> 04:43:45,360
Please insta-burn-in.

8344
04:43:45,560 --> 04:43:46,320
Everybody look at the end.

8345
04:43:46,900 --> 04:43:49,960
I'm enemy ulting a DPS ult, so don't die in the neutral.

8346
04:43:51,960 --> 04:43:52,720
Magic, right side.

8347
04:43:55,680 --> 04:43:57,240
I guess I could do this, but...

8348
04:43:57,980 --> 04:43:59,220
I don't want to waste it.

8349
04:44:00,380 --> 04:44:01,460
Anyone willing to help?

8350
04:44:02,020 --> 04:44:03,920
Adam, Adam, uh, planking on the left.

8351
04:44:04,760 --> 04:44:05,560
I cannot do.

8352
04:44:06,720 --> 04:44:07,480
She missed me.

8353
04:44:07,560 --> 04:44:08,480
She missed someone from Adam.

8354
04:44:08,740 --> 04:44:09,060
Nice.

8355
04:44:09,240 --> 04:44:10,100
No more, no more ults.

8356
04:44:10,240 --> 04:44:10,640
No more ults.

8357
04:44:11,020 --> 04:44:12,520
Stand under my shield if you need to stay.

8358
04:44:12,880 --> 04:44:13,320
I'm staying.

8359
04:44:13,560 --> 04:44:13,860
Great job.

8360
04:44:13,920 --> 04:44:14,240
Nice.

8361
04:44:14,580 --> 04:44:14,640
Okay.

8362
04:44:14,960 --> 04:44:17,280
3, 2, 1.

8363
04:44:17,440 --> 04:44:17,840
Born again.

8364
04:44:18,120 --> 04:44:19,060
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

8365
04:44:19,180 --> 04:44:20,280
Orange and...

8366
04:44:21,140 --> 04:44:22,440
I froze him, I froze him.

8367
04:44:22,440 --> 04:44:22,760
Kill him.

8368
04:44:22,860 --> 04:44:23,380
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

8369
04:44:23,740 --> 04:44:24,900
Kill the Bucky, no bubble.

8370
04:44:25,680 --> 04:44:26,320
She's one.

8371
04:44:27,980 --> 04:44:28,800
Magic's on the left.

8372
04:44:30,000 --> 04:44:31,040
Mag, Mag's low.

8373
04:44:31,200 --> 04:44:31,620
On point.

8374
04:44:32,140 --> 04:44:32,540
I got it.

8375
04:44:32,600 --> 04:44:32,900
Okay.

8376
04:44:33,920 --> 04:44:34,300
Oh, no.

8377
04:44:35,000 --> 04:44:36,160
There's still a Kelo left.

8378
04:44:36,220 --> 04:44:36,420
Okay.

8379
04:44:36,720 --> 04:44:37,280
I got you covered.

8380
04:44:38,440 --> 04:44:40,120
Yo, get these guys main, dude.

8381
04:44:40,440 --> 04:44:40,880
Alright.

8382
04:44:41,300 --> 04:44:41,920
I'm just...

8383
04:44:41,920 --> 04:44:43,680
I'm using all my YouTube for this.

8384
04:44:43,780 --> 04:44:45,360
Oh, shit.

8385
04:44:45,500 --> 04:44:45,920
That's bad.

8386
04:44:46,360 --> 04:44:46,820
That's bad.

8387
04:44:47,420 --> 04:44:47,840
That's bad.

8388
04:44:58,290 --> 04:44:58,890
I'm one.

8389
04:44:58,890 --> 04:44:58,970
Cue.

8390
04:45:07,570 --> 04:45:07,890
Oh.

8391
04:45:08,130 --> 04:45:08,570
I'm just gonna go on.

8392
04:45:08,570 --> 04:45:08,750
I've still won.

8393
04:45:08,930 --> 04:45:09,090
Look at me.

8394
04:45:11,830 --> 04:45:12,470
I'm literally...

8395
04:45:12,470 --> 04:45:17,010
I'm positioning cover- Look at Bucky, look at Bucky, look at Bucky.

8396
04:45:17,190 --> 04:45:18,310
Bucky won, Bucky won, Bucky won!

8397
04:45:18,310 --> 04:45:19,250
Oh, my god, yes, and you know?

8398
04:45:22,270 --> 04:45:28,870
Unfortunately, there's an Inf beverly's enemy of ...

8399
04:45:31,010 --> 04:45:31,970
Wait, do we have res?

8400
04:45:32,270 --> 04:45:33,550
Oh, we have res here.

8401
04:45:38,240 --> 04:45:39,460
I'm not going in there.

8402
04:45:39,480 --> 04:45:42,180
I feel like I was going fucking insane that fight, by the way.

8403
04:45:42,280 --> 04:45:43,260
What did we, like, do?

8404
04:45:43,900 --> 04:45:45,520
Oh, I did so much!

8405
04:45:46,640 --> 04:45:48,040
One healer dead, one healer dead.

8406
04:45:48,800 --> 04:45:51,740
Yeah, we should just... Yo, spawn camp the healer again.

8407
04:45:52,180 --> 04:45:53,580
Sylock, go left, spawn camp the healer.

8408
04:45:55,140 --> 04:45:56,620
Oh, I'm getting caved, man.

8409
04:45:56,620 --> 04:45:57,420
There's a portal.

8410
04:45:59,920 --> 04:46:03,360
I have to keep this.

8411
04:46:03,360 --> 04:46:04,400
Any eyes on magic?

8412
04:46:07,220 --> 04:46:09,220
Let's wrap wide left, wide left, come, come, come.

8413
04:46:09,300 --> 04:46:10,440
Wide left, wide left, wide left.

8414
04:46:12,200 --> 04:46:12,600
Okay.

8415
04:46:13,340 --> 04:46:13,900
Now we just pinch.

8416
04:46:16,500 --> 04:46:19,720
Magic's on the right, but you do not pull.

8417
04:46:19,720 --> 04:46:21,260
Yo, burn rocket, burn rocket.

8418
04:46:22,300 --> 04:46:23,380
Oh my god.

8419
04:46:24,260 --> 04:46:24,880
I'm gonna pull.

8420
04:46:26,160 --> 04:46:27,740
I did have it!

8421
04:46:28,360 --> 04:46:30,660
Karaki is fucking trolling!

8422
04:46:31,640 --> 04:46:32,320
Karaki, Karaki.

8423
04:46:32,340 --> 04:46:34,960
I killed her magic, and our enemies' dead eyes pulls him away.

8424
04:46:36,140 --> 04:46:37,020
I don't know, man.

8425
04:46:37,220 --> 04:46:38,620
I didn't know they were pulling.

8426
04:46:38,940 --> 04:46:41,120
Wait, one more fight, one more fight, one more fight, one more fight.

8427
04:46:41,420 --> 04:46:42,040
Oh my god.

8428
04:46:42,300 --> 04:46:43,500
I didn't realize he pulled.

8429
04:46:43,960 --> 04:46:44,900
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

8430
04:46:45,520 --> 04:46:46,640
I'm getting caved by Bucky.

8431
04:46:47,300 --> 04:46:48,240
I'm getting caved by Bucky.

8432
04:46:48,680 --> 04:46:49,200
Someone's gotta touch.

8433
04:46:49,320 --> 04:46:49,860
Someone's gotta touch.

8434
04:46:50,200 --> 04:46:50,440
Someone's gotta touch.

8435
04:46:50,680 --> 04:46:52,880
I threw that, I messed through that.

8436
04:46:56,400 --> 04:46:57,640
That was my bad.

8437
04:46:57,800 --> 04:46:58,620
I didn't realize.

8438
04:47:00,480 --> 04:47:02,840
Oh, I didn't realize he grabbed her.

8439
04:47:04,660 --> 04:47:05,580
If I knew.

8440
04:47:11,260 --> 04:47:12,780
I couldn't do anything.

8441
04:47:15,920 --> 04:47:17,480
Oh, that was my bad.

8442
04:47:17,680 --> 04:47:18,040
I threw that.

8443
04:47:18,280 --> 04:47:19,460
I actually threw that.

8444
04:47:21,140 --> 04:47:22,940
Oh, I fucking threw that.

8445
04:47:26,860 --> 04:47:28,180
I threw that.

8446
04:47:28,660 --> 04:47:30,400
I didn't realize he grabbed the...

8447
04:47:30,400 --> 04:47:31,480
We have a retard.

8448
04:47:32,520 --> 04:47:33,720
No, it's not me, bro.

8449
04:47:34,020 --> 04:47:37,540
I didn't realize we had a guy that grabbed the...

8450
04:47:37,540 --> 04:47:38,620
I didn't realize he grabbed her.

8451
04:47:39,020 --> 04:47:40,820
I was trying to push her away.

8452
04:47:47,560 --> 04:47:48,840
I didn't realize.

8453
04:47:49,840 --> 04:47:50,960
That was my bad.

8454
04:47:51,180 --> 04:47:51,840
I did...

8455
04:47:53,260 --> 04:47:55,500
I fucked up once, and then like...

8456
04:47:57,960 --> 04:47:58,440
Um...

8457
04:48:00,140 --> 04:48:00,620
So...

8458
04:48:01,200 --> 04:48:02,460
Was he saying slurs?

8459
04:48:02,500 --> 04:48:02,980
I couldn't tell.

8460
04:48:06,980 --> 04:48:07,460
Yeah...

8461
04:48:10,340 --> 04:48:12,240
I literally was like...

8462
04:48:12,240 --> 04:48:13,760
I like got...

8463
04:48:14,400 --> 04:48:14,880
Really...

8464
04:48:14,880 --> 04:48:15,580
Uh...

8465
04:48:15,580 --> 04:48:15,980
He was?

8466
04:48:16,220 --> 04:48:16,480
Okay.

8467
04:48:18,480 --> 04:48:20,000
Oh, he was like voice chat, right?

8468
04:48:25,000 --> 04:48:25,960
Sad slurs.

8469
04:48:29,420 --> 04:48:29,900
Uh...

8470
04:48:29,900 --> 04:48:30,800
I don't have...

8471
04:48:30,800 --> 04:48:31,780
Let me add him.

8472
04:48:32,220 --> 04:48:33,400
I don't know if he's down, though.

8473
04:48:34,340 --> 04:48:35,180
What was it?

8474
04:48:35,280 --> 04:48:35,900
Rain and garlic?

8475
04:48:41,810 --> 04:48:42,830
Oh, there it is.

8476
04:48:44,950 --> 04:48:45,430
Uh...

8477
04:48:47,610 --> 04:48:48,570
I think I...

8478
04:48:48,570 --> 04:48:52,590
I fucked up that part, and then I got blamed the entire round because of it.

8479
04:48:52,930 --> 04:48:55,070
I got blamed for it both...

8480
04:48:55,070 --> 04:48:56,130
Like, I'm like...

8481
04:48:56,130 --> 04:48:58,470
Why did they blame me for the entire match?

8482
04:48:58,690 --> 04:49:00,590
When I fucked up one play?

8483
04:49:02,010 --> 04:49:02,570
Uh...

8484
04:49:02,570 --> 04:49:02,990
I fuck...

8485
04:49:02,990 --> 04:49:04,070
I literally...

8486
04:49:04,070 --> 04:49:07,470
Fucked up one play, and then it was my fault.

8487
04:49:09,790 --> 04:49:10,350
Like...

8488
04:49:11,010 --> 04:49:12,170
I don't understand.

8489
04:49:15,820 --> 04:49:18,140
I think it was like one play moment.

8490
04:49:21,370 --> 04:49:23,050
And then like...

8491
04:49:23,770 --> 04:49:25,070
I felt like I...

8492
04:49:25,550 --> 04:49:26,670
Kept getting...

8493
04:49:26,670 --> 04:49:27,030
Died?

8494
04:49:27,270 --> 04:49:30,070
And then I was not getting peeled for it.

8495
04:49:36,750 --> 04:49:38,190
I literally...

8496
04:49:39,590 --> 04:49:40,310
Uh...

8497
04:49:40,310 --> 04:49:41,810
And like...

8498
04:49:41,810 --> 04:49:42,890
Uh...

8499
04:49:42,890 --> 04:49:43,250
Yeah.

8500
04:49:47,880 --> 04:49:49,120
Bro, really?

8501
04:49:49,400 --> 04:49:50,340
You're gonna create...

8502
04:49:53,060 --> 04:49:53,700
Really?

8503
04:49:55,500 --> 04:49:57,180
You're gonna critique me.

8504
04:50:02,360 --> 04:50:03,000
Yeah.

8505
04:50:07,880 --> 04:50:08,520
Okay.

8506
04:50:10,840 --> 04:50:13,600
I literally shielded her and healed her.

8507
04:50:13,720 --> 04:50:16,060
And then she won't even heal me for a magic.

8508
04:50:16,320 --> 04:50:17,640
I have to save shield...

8509
04:50:18,140 --> 04:50:19,280
Every time.

8510
04:50:19,560 --> 04:50:20,180
Every time.

8511
04:50:20,340 --> 04:50:22,540
I say shield against the magic dive.

8512
04:50:22,840 --> 04:50:25,320
I can't use it for anything else.

8513
04:50:25,780 --> 04:50:26,480
That was the...

8514
04:50:26,480 --> 04:50:28,220
And then she won't even heal me.

8515
04:50:28,660 --> 04:50:29,340
Like...

8516
04:50:29,340 --> 04:50:29,580
I...

8517
04:50:29,580 --> 04:50:31,000
I was so tilted at that.

8518
04:50:31,240 --> 04:50:31,880
I was like...

8519
04:50:31,880 --> 04:50:32,720
What do you mean?

8520
04:50:32,920 --> 04:50:33,340
Like...

8521
04:50:33,340 --> 04:50:34,820
Save my push...

8522
04:50:34,820 --> 04:50:35,860
And my...

8523
04:50:35,860 --> 04:50:36,860
Invis...

8524
04:50:36,860 --> 04:50:38,360
For one person?

8525
04:50:39,980 --> 04:50:40,660
When...

8526
04:50:41,340 --> 04:50:41,980
When...

8527
04:50:41,980 --> 04:50:44,540
He could've healed me...

8528
04:50:44,540 --> 04:50:45,740
Through the damage.

8529
04:50:45,740 --> 04:50:46,740
Like...

8530
04:50:47,260 --> 04:50:47,960
Like...

8531
04:50:52,140 --> 04:50:53,540
Like...

8532
04:50:53,540 --> 04:50:55,640
Like...

8533
04:50:55,640 --> 04:50:58,360
Like...

8534
04:50:58,360 --> 04:50:58,620
Like...

8535
04:50:58,620 --> 04:50:59,360
Like...

8536
04:50:59,360 --> 04:51:00,820
Like...

8537
04:51:02,470 --> 04:51:03,690
Like...

8538
04:51:03,690 --> 04:51:03,870
Like...

8539
04:51:03,870 --> 04:51:04,010
Like...

8540
04:51:04,010 --> 04:51:04,090
Like...

8541
04:51:04,090 --> 04:51:04,390
Like...

8542
04:51:04,390 --> 04:51:04,590
Like...

8543
04:51:04,590 --> 04:51:04,730
Like...

8544
04:51:04,730 --> 04:51:04,750
Like...

8545
04:51:05,390 --> 04:51:06,390
Like...

8546
04:51:08,450 --> 04:51:09,850
Like...

8547
04:51:13,210 --> 04:51:14,610
Like...

8548
04:51:14,610 --> 04:51:15,350
Like...

8549
04:51:15,350 --> 04:51:16,430
Like...

8550
04:51:16,430 --> 04:51:16,450
Like...

8551
04:51:16,450 --> 04:51:17,350
Like...

8552
04:51:17,350 --> 04:51:17,530
Balloons.

8553
04:51:20,710 --> 04:51:22,270
I don't know if he'll accept it.

8554
04:51:22,570 --> 04:51:23,710
Oh, I did re-download!

8555
04:51:23,830 --> 04:51:24,930
Wait, no, I have balloons.

8556
04:51:25,170 --> 04:51:25,390
Okay.

8557
04:51:27,930 --> 04:51:29,830
I don't want to do another solo queue match.

8558
04:51:30,470 --> 04:51:32,410
That one was like...

8559
04:51:34,650 --> 04:51:35,910
It's ice monkey time.

8560
04:51:43,230 --> 04:51:44,970
Alright, it's balloons time while we wait.

8561
04:51:45,610 --> 04:51:46,410
Whoops, that's just...

8562
04:51:47,270 --> 04:51:49,110
Wait, do I have extra for it?

8563
04:51:49,450 --> 04:51:50,310
It's this, right?

8564
04:51:51,190 --> 04:51:52,810
Can this play balloons?

8565
04:51:53,070 --> 04:51:53,570
Oh, it can.

8566
04:51:54,570 --> 04:51:54,910
Alright.

8567
04:52:02,100 --> 04:52:03,940
Wait, actually, it doesn't matter.

8568
04:52:04,100 --> 04:52:04,540
It can be full.

8569
04:52:05,000 --> 04:52:05,380
Alright.

8570
04:52:09,180 --> 04:52:11,760
I don't know when if he'll actually add me, though.

8571
04:52:12,820 --> 04:52:13,220
Let's see.

8572
04:52:14,660 --> 04:52:17,420
Balloons to see if Super wants...

8573
04:52:18,000 --> 04:52:21,780
Balloons waiting to see if Super wants to duo.

8574
04:52:30,640 --> 04:52:33,800
I literally did one mistake and it was the...

8575
04:52:33,800 --> 04:52:35,200
It was pulling...

8576
04:52:35,200 --> 04:52:36,680
Pulling the magic.

8577
04:52:39,800 --> 04:52:42,660
And then I got blamed for the entire game.

8578
04:52:42,980 --> 04:52:43,600
It's crazy.

8579
04:52:47,330 --> 04:52:48,510
Alright, let's see.

8580
04:52:49,630 --> 04:52:50,690
It's Bloons time.

8581
04:52:51,670 --> 04:52:53,770
Wait, did I not complete that one?

8582
04:52:54,450 --> 04:52:55,450
I thought I did.

8583
04:52:55,910 --> 04:52:56,550
Oh, no.

8584
04:52:56,690 --> 04:52:58,910
I almost completed it and I didn't know what I was doing.

8585
04:53:00,150 --> 04:53:00,530
Alright.

8586
04:53:00,950 --> 04:53:03,410
This is why support players don't play this game anymore.

8587
04:53:04,490 --> 04:53:06,670
That guy was blaming everybody but himself.

8588
04:53:10,410 --> 04:53:11,590
How much money I have?

8589
04:53:11,750 --> 04:53:11,890
Oh.

8590
04:53:12,990 --> 04:53:14,130
What if I just do this?

8591
04:53:15,690 --> 04:53:18,490
With enough fuel and air, everything burns.

8592
04:53:19,710 --> 04:53:20,190
Yeah.

8593
04:53:26,600 --> 04:53:27,080
Alright.

8594
04:53:27,460 --> 04:53:27,980
I won a match.

8595
04:53:28,140 --> 04:53:32,480
I threw that one round but I didn't think that it was me that caused the whole fight to be lost.

8596
04:53:33,300 --> 04:53:35,100
And then I'll do Ice Monkey next.

8597
04:53:36,920 --> 04:53:38,480
It's not an actual strike.

8598
04:53:38,600 --> 04:53:41,760
People just don't want to play support because it's not fun.

8599
04:53:44,820 --> 04:53:46,740
It's just not fun right now.

8600
04:53:47,040 --> 04:53:48,180
That matter fucking sucks.

8601
04:53:51,980 --> 04:53:53,400
This is most important.

8602
04:53:53,980 --> 04:53:54,760
Ice Monkey!

8603
04:53:59,250 --> 04:54:01,250
Wait, I was supposed to have another stream tonight.

8604
04:54:03,010 --> 04:54:04,130
I forgot.

8605
04:54:05,290 --> 04:54:08,050
I forgot I was supposed to have another stream tonight.

8606
04:54:08,750 --> 04:54:09,950
Okay, but like...

8607
04:54:09,950 --> 04:54:11,390
I could just do this though.

8608
04:54:16,750 --> 04:54:18,230
Oh, I need to get some...

8609
04:54:18,230 --> 04:54:20,030
I need him to kill Camo.

8610
04:54:27,010 --> 04:54:28,490
Alright, and then...

8611
04:54:28,490 --> 04:54:29,090
Ice Monkey!

8612
04:54:31,850 --> 04:54:33,230
Does this get Camo?

8613
04:54:33,270 --> 04:54:33,930
I don't remember.

8614
04:54:34,290 --> 04:54:35,470
I want more Ice Monkey though.

8615
04:54:36,590 --> 04:54:37,590
Oh shit.

8616
04:54:37,590 --> 04:54:37,950
Okay.

8617
04:54:38,670 --> 04:54:39,010
Wait.

8618
04:54:39,730 --> 04:54:40,250
Here.

8619
04:54:40,890 --> 04:54:41,850
And then...

8620
04:54:41,850 --> 04:54:42,750
Ice Monkey!

8621
04:54:49,960 --> 04:54:51,500
And then I should...

8622
04:54:51,500 --> 04:54:53,380
I should save up for...

8623
04:54:53,380 --> 04:54:54,320
The helicopter.

8624
04:54:59,290 --> 04:55:00,430
I don't...

8625
04:55:00,430 --> 04:55:01,190
Wait, let's see.

8626
04:55:08,870 --> 04:55:09,590
Alright.

8627
04:55:16,220 --> 04:55:17,660
And then...

8628
04:55:19,440 --> 04:55:20,880
I'll do...

8629
04:55:20,880 --> 04:55:22,000
I need a thousand.

8630
04:55:22,700 --> 04:55:23,020
Okay.

8631
04:55:24,080 --> 04:55:25,400
This is our subway surface.

8632
04:55:25,580 --> 04:55:26,260
Yeah, it is.

8633
04:55:26,780 --> 04:55:27,860
It is!

8634
04:55:28,100 --> 04:55:29,360
More Ice Monkey.

8635
04:55:29,940 --> 04:55:31,700
Ice Monkey is always good.

8636
04:55:40,870 --> 04:55:41,590
Alright.

8637
04:55:47,030 --> 04:55:49,330
Just so you can see my sniper guy right here.

8638
04:55:50,710 --> 04:55:51,730
I think it's fine.

8639
04:55:51,930 --> 04:55:52,450
I don't have to worry.

8640
04:55:53,310 --> 04:55:54,610
Ice Monkey is doing everything.

8641
04:55:55,490 --> 04:55:58,310
No, I'm lagging because I have rivals in the background.

8642
04:55:59,110 --> 04:55:59,810
That's why.

8643
04:56:00,710 --> 04:56:03,230
My game doesn't let me have two at the same time.

8644
04:56:06,050 --> 04:56:06,490
Okay.

8645
04:56:06,610 --> 04:56:07,690
And then I can put helicopter.

8646
04:56:09,070 --> 04:56:09,510
Helicopter!

8647
04:56:12,110 --> 04:56:13,510
Things should be okay now.

8648
04:56:13,630 --> 04:56:14,290
I have helicopter.

8649
04:56:14,730 --> 04:56:15,450
Oh, I should.

8650
04:56:16,190 --> 04:56:16,670
Okay, wait.

8651
04:56:16,890 --> 04:56:17,930
I need to get this upgrade first.

8652
04:56:18,910 --> 04:56:19,850
Okay, I got...

8653
04:56:19,850 --> 04:56:20,870
Okay, I need this upgrade too.

8654
04:56:21,150 --> 04:56:22,290
Oh my god!

8655
04:56:22,450 --> 04:56:22,890
Okay!

8656
04:56:22,950 --> 04:56:23,830
This is bad.

8657
04:56:24,070 --> 04:56:24,390
Oh!

8658
04:56:27,290 --> 04:56:29,130
Oh, that was not a good time.

8659
04:56:29,230 --> 04:56:31,630
Okay, now I can upgrade my other stuff.

8660
04:56:31,630 --> 04:56:32,550
Alright.

8661
04:56:34,890 --> 04:56:36,310
Okay, we need fast firing.

8662
04:56:36,630 --> 04:56:37,170
And then...

8663
04:56:37,170 --> 04:56:39,470
We should actually get some other stuff.

8664
04:56:39,770 --> 04:56:41,330
Which one does camo again?

8665
04:56:45,810 --> 04:56:47,030
Which one does camo?

8666
04:56:47,090 --> 04:56:47,470
I forgot.

8667
04:56:47,950 --> 04:56:49,950
Is it bigger jets or faster...

8668
04:56:49,950 --> 04:56:50,190
Middle?

8669
04:56:50,430 --> 04:56:50,650
Okay.

8670
04:56:50,850 --> 04:56:51,450
Oh, there it is.

8671
04:56:51,450 --> 04:56:52,770
Yeah, we need him for camo.

8672
04:56:55,890 --> 04:56:56,850
And then...

8673
04:56:56,850 --> 04:56:57,530
Camo!

8674
04:57:01,530 --> 04:57:03,650
And then we'll stay up for another helicopter.

8675
04:57:07,980 --> 04:57:08,920
I think we have enough...

8676
04:57:08,920 --> 04:57:10,160
Yeah, we can have enough for a helicopter.

8677
04:57:10,580 --> 04:57:11,300
Fire bomb!

8678
04:57:12,720 --> 04:57:13,200
Oh!

8679
04:57:15,460 --> 04:57:16,280
I forgot.

8680
04:57:17,320 --> 04:57:17,800
I...

8681
04:57:17,800 --> 04:57:18,860
Turned off.

8682
04:57:21,840 --> 04:57:24,740
I forgot I turned it off because things were really bad.

8683
04:57:24,960 --> 04:57:26,460
Things were really bad.

8684
04:57:26,620 --> 04:57:27,760
I forgot about that.

8685
04:57:30,200 --> 04:57:31,020
Fire bomb!

8686
04:57:31,620 --> 04:57:32,800
Okay, I can afford another one.

8687
04:57:33,880 --> 04:57:34,920
And then...

8688
04:57:34,920 --> 04:57:35,720
We'll do that.

8689
04:57:35,940 --> 04:57:37,020
And then we'll do...

8690
04:57:39,300 --> 04:57:40,720
I forgot all about that.

8691
04:57:40,960 --> 04:57:41,360
There you go.

8692
04:57:42,120 --> 04:57:43,260
And then...

8693
04:57:43,260 --> 04:57:44,360
Fire bomb!

8694
04:57:46,020 --> 04:57:46,540
Okay.

8695
04:57:46,900 --> 04:57:47,800
And then...

8696
04:57:47,800 --> 04:57:49,660
Honestly, I think we need to get someone for camo.

8697
04:57:53,960 --> 04:57:56,500
I wish I could, like, speed it up even more.

8698
04:58:01,460 --> 04:58:01,960
All right.

8699
04:58:02,160 --> 04:58:03,000
And then...

8700
04:58:04,300 --> 04:58:05,180
Oh, nice sniper.

8701
04:58:05,320 --> 04:58:06,600
Just for the sake of it.

8702
04:58:07,360 --> 04:58:09,440
I feel like we need it just for the camo.

8703
04:58:12,540 --> 04:58:13,020
Okay, yeah.

8704
04:58:13,060 --> 04:58:13,600
Let's get that.

8705
04:58:14,420 --> 04:58:14,920
Hi, Doki!

8706
04:58:15,040 --> 04:58:16,020
It's my birthday today!

8707
04:58:17,400 --> 04:58:19,980
Two Doki streams in one day is a really big gift.

8708
04:58:20,180 --> 04:58:21,580
Thanks for all the fun memories on the air.

8709
04:58:21,740 --> 04:58:22,420
And so many more.

8710
04:58:22,420 --> 04:58:23,560
Thank you, Fistball!

8711
04:58:23,900 --> 04:58:24,900
I really appreciate it!

8712
04:58:25,300 --> 04:58:26,900
Happy birthday to you!

8713
04:58:27,140 --> 04:58:28,840
Happy birthday to you!

8714
04:58:29,140 --> 04:58:31,120
Happy birthday, dear Fistball!

8715
04:58:31,440 --> 04:58:32,980
Happy birthday to you!

8716
04:58:33,200 --> 04:58:33,480
Yeah!

8717
04:58:33,960 --> 04:58:34,980
I hope it's not too loud.

8718
04:58:35,240 --> 04:58:36,040
Let me turn it down.

8719
04:58:44,500 --> 04:58:45,500
I should...

8720
04:58:45,500 --> 04:58:46,880
Bring my helicopter.

8721
04:58:47,800 --> 04:58:48,640
Fire bomb!

8722
04:58:49,880 --> 04:58:52,900
Because I was, like, wondering, what happened to my fucking fire bombs?

8723
04:58:53,240 --> 04:58:53,860
Oh, wait.

8724
04:58:53,900 --> 04:58:54,880
I forgot about my monkey.

8725
04:58:55,060 --> 04:58:55,980
They need to be stronger.

8726
04:58:56,740 --> 04:58:57,740
Stronger monkeys!

8727
04:59:00,160 --> 04:59:01,580
Are they super said no?

8728
04:59:06,040 --> 04:59:09,780
Because I added him, and he didn't accept it, so I think he said no.

8729
04:59:20,490 --> 04:59:22,570
And he rejected my friend request.

8730
04:59:23,870 --> 04:59:24,410
Today's...

8731
04:59:24,410 --> 04:59:26,150
Maybe I do need therapy today.

8732
04:59:32,310 --> 04:59:33,530
Oh, I did it!

8733
04:59:33,710 --> 04:59:33,890
Yeah!

8734
04:59:36,490 --> 04:59:37,290
It's okay.

8735
04:59:37,690 --> 04:59:39,230
I don't need more friends.

8736
04:59:42,050 --> 04:59:45,070
Who needs therapy when I have Ice Monkey?

8737
04:59:45,650 --> 04:59:46,330
You're right.

8738
04:59:47,910 --> 04:59:49,010
Bloons is better.

8739
04:59:49,190 --> 04:59:49,590
You're right.

8740
04:59:49,710 --> 04:59:51,170
Bloons is my therapy.

8741
04:59:52,110 --> 04:59:54,690
Bloons is my therapy today.

8742
04:59:56,010 --> 04:59:58,870
All the pro teams are in a tournament right now.

8743
05:00:03,470 --> 05:00:05,690
And I could do this, and then save...

8744
05:00:05,690 --> 05:00:07,030
I'll do this and save for it.

8745
05:00:08,150 --> 05:00:09,230
I'm gonna save for it.

8746
05:00:09,890 --> 05:00:10,710
This guy.

8747
05:00:14,800 --> 05:00:16,660
Ice Monkey is all I need.

8748
05:00:20,570 --> 05:00:21,530
I just need...

8749
05:00:21,530 --> 05:00:23,110
Okay, but I need this guy too.

8750
05:00:24,070 --> 05:00:24,870
Yeah, all the...

8751
05:00:24,870 --> 05:00:25,650
All the teams are...

8752
05:00:28,130 --> 05:00:29,870
Everyone's in a tournament at the moment.

8753
05:00:31,330 --> 05:00:34,590
I don't think Tyler1 is ever gonna play Rivals again until...

8754
05:00:34,590 --> 05:00:35,490
Unless he's getting paid.

8755
05:00:36,570 --> 05:00:36,870
I...

8756
05:00:36,870 --> 05:00:38,270
The Jimmy don't think he's coming back.

8757
05:00:38,270 --> 05:00:38,830
That guy...

8758
05:00:40,350 --> 05:00:43,230
I don't think he's coming back.

8759
05:00:43,710 --> 05:00:43,730
God.

8760
05:00:47,910 --> 05:00:50,730
I need Bloons to make me happy again.

8761
05:00:55,210 --> 05:00:56,680
Okay, I need...

8762
05:00:58,730 --> 05:00:59,550
Wait...

8763
05:00:59,550 --> 05:01:00,930
Okay, we need Sniper.

8764
05:01:04,650 --> 05:01:07,450
All right, the Sniper is good so I can buy Camo.

8765
05:01:10,790 --> 05:01:12,310
I think, like...

8766
05:01:12,310 --> 05:01:13,750
He literally just...

8767
05:01:13,750 --> 05:01:15,990
Uninstalled the game right after.

8768
05:01:16,610 --> 05:01:17,950
I won't blame him.

8769
05:01:18,190 --> 05:01:18,530
That's...

8770
05:01:18,530 --> 05:01:18,970
Like...

8771
05:01:18,970 --> 05:01:20,810
He literally got so target banned.

8772
05:01:22,690 --> 05:01:24,390
That they, like, uninstalled...

8773
05:01:24,390 --> 05:01:25,290
Like, he uninstalled.

8774
05:01:28,270 --> 05:01:30,690
Only Bloons will make me happy today.

8775
05:01:34,050 --> 05:01:35,230
Oh, I can't...

8776
05:01:35,230 --> 05:01:37,130
Do this.

8777
05:01:38,310 --> 05:01:39,450
It's okay.

8778
05:01:42,230 --> 05:01:44,190
I don't need more friends.

8779
05:01:44,190 --> 05:01:45,430
I have Ice Monkey.

8780
05:01:51,070 --> 05:01:52,290
It's okay.

8781
05:01:52,290 --> 05:01:54,790
I have my trusty Ice Monkey.

8782
05:01:58,370 --> 05:02:00,030
What the hell happened?

8783
05:02:00,970 --> 05:02:02,790
Our team got...

8784
05:02:02,790 --> 05:02:04,530
We fucked up our band line.

8785
05:02:08,580 --> 05:02:09,860
And we didn't combo.

8786
05:02:10,080 --> 05:02:10,620
We didn't combo.

8787
05:02:10,640 --> 05:02:11,580
I would agree...

8788
05:02:11,580 --> 05:02:13,160
That went from Gale.

8789
05:02:13,500 --> 05:02:15,480
When he was saying we didn't combo anything.

8790
05:02:16,560 --> 05:02:17,360
But, like...

8791
05:02:17,360 --> 05:02:18,680
I think Lydia was so...

8792
05:02:18,680 --> 05:02:20,020
Lydia was already so overwhelmed.

8793
05:02:20,140 --> 05:02:21,100
It's really not her fault.

8794
05:02:22,860 --> 05:02:23,400
Like...

8795
05:02:23,400 --> 05:02:25,960
I understand why Gale wanted me on Rocket.

8796
05:02:26,280 --> 05:02:28,040
Because, obviously, I would...

8797
05:02:28,040 --> 05:02:28,960
Play...

8798
05:02:28,960 --> 05:02:30,840
I can play Rocket a lot better.

8799
05:02:31,140 --> 05:02:31,720
But, like...

8800
05:02:31,720 --> 05:02:33,980
Literally, that is Lydia's only character.

8801
05:02:33,980 --> 05:02:34,940
That she could play.

8802
05:02:39,600 --> 05:02:41,160
Yeah, she was trying her best.

8803
05:02:41,340 --> 05:02:42,120
So, it's really...

8804
05:02:42,120 --> 05:02:43,380
That's what...

8805
05:02:43,380 --> 05:02:44,500
There's nothing we could do.

8806
05:02:45,580 --> 05:02:46,500
But, it's okay.

8807
05:02:46,580 --> 05:02:47,360
I have Ice Monkey.

8808
05:02:47,740 --> 05:02:48,720
I did good, though.

8809
05:02:48,840 --> 05:02:49,280
I know...

8810
05:02:49,280 --> 05:02:50,060
I feel like...

8811
05:02:50,060 --> 05:02:51,560
I did really good.

8812
05:02:51,820 --> 05:02:52,400
So, like...

8813
05:02:52,400 --> 05:02:53,540
I'm not too bothered.

8814
05:02:53,780 --> 05:02:54,500
Because I think...

8815
05:02:54,500 --> 05:02:56,040
My own performance was good.

8816
05:02:58,340 --> 05:02:59,120
I mean...

8817
05:02:59,120 --> 05:03:00,280
She literally earned the game.

8818
05:03:00,440 --> 05:03:00,920
Like...

8819
05:03:00,920 --> 05:03:01,300
This week.

8820
05:03:03,300 --> 05:03:04,060
There's like...

8821
05:03:04,060 --> 05:03:05,600
Not much she could do at that time.

8822
05:03:06,680 --> 05:03:07,820
Yeah, it's Super's fault.

8823
05:03:08,640 --> 05:03:09,900
And he ghosted me.

8824
05:03:10,100 --> 05:03:10,640
So, now it's...

8825
05:03:10,640 --> 05:03:12,080
It's definitely his fault.

8826
05:03:20,170 --> 05:03:21,890
Do I have enough for this?

8827
05:03:22,110 --> 05:03:22,710
Oh, fuck.

8828
05:03:22,810 --> 05:03:23,410
I don't think I do.

8829
05:03:26,820 --> 05:03:27,220
Okay.

8830
05:03:28,060 --> 05:03:28,760
I should have enough now.

8831
05:03:31,480 --> 05:03:32,600
Okay, I need to do this.

8832
05:03:32,740 --> 05:03:33,540
And then get...

8833
05:03:33,540 --> 05:03:34,040
500.

8834
05:03:38,020 --> 05:03:38,420
Okay.

8835
05:03:43,360 --> 05:03:44,640
Let me firebomb here.

8836
05:03:44,760 --> 05:03:45,900
And I should have enough for...

8837
05:03:45,900 --> 05:03:46,940
Oh, I need 800?

8838
05:03:47,780 --> 05:03:49,980
Oh, 500 is the other one.

8839
05:03:50,140 --> 05:03:50,540
Fuck.

8840
05:03:57,030 --> 05:03:57,430
Okay.

8841
05:04:02,940 --> 05:04:03,780
Okay, there we go.

8842
05:04:04,200 --> 05:04:04,980
That should be good.

8843
05:04:05,040 --> 05:04:06,260
And then I need to save up for...

8844
05:04:06,260 --> 05:04:07,280
The camo.

8845
05:04:08,660 --> 05:04:09,580
And I guess I...

8846
05:04:09,580 --> 05:04:10,200
I mean...

8847
05:04:10,200 --> 05:04:11,980
I'll do camo first, actually.

8848
05:04:12,300 --> 05:04:13,520
Just because I feel like...

8849
05:04:13,520 --> 05:04:14,520
Camo is a dangerous one.

8850
05:04:16,000 --> 05:04:17,100
And then...

8851
05:04:17,100 --> 05:04:18,220
Firebomb!

8852
05:04:19,300 --> 05:04:21,200
I have another sniper just because...

8853
05:04:22,780 --> 05:04:25,040
I'll focus on upgrading my monkeys.

8854
05:04:26,120 --> 05:04:27,040
Monkeys, go!

8855
05:04:27,200 --> 05:04:29,060
Oh, I should focus on upgrading these guys, too.

8856
05:04:30,620 --> 05:04:32,080
Go, monkeys, go!

8857
05:04:39,480 --> 05:04:40,480
Should be good.

8858
05:04:42,000 --> 05:04:43,120
And then...

8859
05:04:43,120 --> 05:04:45,020
My monkey should keep going.

8860
05:04:46,840 --> 05:04:47,680
Firebomb!

8861
05:04:57,360 --> 05:04:58,200
Firebomb!

8862
05:04:59,500 --> 05:05:01,620
I love Firebomb.

8863
05:05:03,980 --> 05:05:06,940
Oh, I have enough for another helicopter.

8864
05:05:06,940 --> 05:05:07,320
Yay!

8865
05:05:10,320 --> 05:05:10,840
Firebomb!

8866
05:05:14,040 --> 05:05:14,560
Nice.

8867
05:05:17,080 --> 05:05:18,860
Okay, wait, I forgot about this part.

8868
05:05:19,420 --> 05:05:24,260
I legit forgot to do the other part of this build.

8869
05:05:25,040 --> 05:05:29,960
I was so relaxed, like, just controlling my guy and myself.

8870
05:05:34,470 --> 05:05:34,990
Yay!

8871
05:05:35,950 --> 05:05:36,170
Oh.

8872
05:05:36,650 --> 05:05:37,790
Okay, it's not done yet.

8873
05:05:37,790 --> 05:05:39,670
I thought I finished it.

8874
05:05:42,970 --> 05:05:43,410
Alright.

8875
05:05:47,380 --> 05:05:48,160
Be nice.

8876
05:05:48,800 --> 05:05:49,240
Firebomb!

8877
05:05:56,710 --> 05:05:57,150
Alright.

8878
05:05:57,610 --> 05:06:01,570
Oh, okay, I was gonna say, like... Oh, shit, I was not paying attention.

8879
05:06:02,110 --> 05:06:06,230
I... Oh, wait, that's bad.

8880
05:06:06,330 --> 05:06:06,910
Okay, that's fine.

8881
05:06:07,570 --> 05:06:08,970
Wait, I should... Oh, I didn't realize.

8882
05:06:09,390 --> 05:06:12,550
Sorry, I... Something showed up, so I had to look at it.

8883
05:06:12,550 --> 05:06:15,330
But... My phone had, like, a notification.

8884
05:06:15,330 --> 05:06:17,490
I was like, what is notifying me right now?

8885
05:06:24,100 --> 05:06:25,100
Oh... Firebomb!

8886
05:06:32,340 --> 05:06:33,800
What time is my other stream?

8887
05:06:34,700 --> 05:06:35,720
Is that at 7?

8888
05:06:36,100 --> 05:06:36,800
Or 9?

8889
05:06:37,380 --> 05:06:38,560
It's at 9, right?

8890
05:06:39,000 --> 05:06:39,500
Okay.

8891
05:06:39,900 --> 05:06:41,280
I can play Bloons a little longer.

8892
05:06:48,740 --> 05:06:50,320
No, this is...

8893
05:06:50,960 --> 05:06:52,880
This is just a...

8894
05:06:52,880 --> 05:06:54,720
It's just me playing...

8895
05:06:55,800 --> 05:06:57,140
Playing Bloons now.

8896
05:06:57,480 --> 05:06:58,460
I need to relax.

8897
05:07:00,560 --> 05:07:01,120
Firebomb!

8898
05:07:01,360 --> 05:07:02,520
I'm just relaxing now.

8899
05:07:02,660 --> 05:07:02,900
It's nothing.

8900
05:07:03,040 --> 05:07:04,140
Oh, wait, I forgot to upgrade.

8901
05:07:04,460 --> 05:07:05,500
I've been chilling.

8902
05:07:06,260 --> 05:07:07,060
Ha ha ha ha!

8903
05:07:09,240 --> 05:07:09,920
What's this?

8904
05:07:12,300 --> 05:07:12,860
Firebomb!

8905
05:07:13,460 --> 05:07:14,820
I've just been relaxing.

8906
05:07:16,880 --> 05:07:18,260
This is my therapy.

8907
05:07:18,660 --> 05:07:19,600
It's cheaper, too.

8908
05:07:19,980 --> 05:07:21,160
Because it's free to play.

8909
05:07:35,320 --> 05:07:36,000
All right.

8910
05:07:36,960 --> 05:07:37,480
Firebomb!

8911
05:07:42,230 --> 05:07:43,690
Oh my God, it's so easy.

8912
05:07:43,870 --> 05:07:45,070
Wait, this is such an easy game.

8913
05:07:45,370 --> 05:07:47,290
I'm not even spending money anymore.

8914
05:07:47,550 --> 05:07:48,170
Ha ha ha!

8915
05:07:48,630 --> 05:07:49,330
Oh, shit.

8916
05:07:53,070 --> 05:07:54,450
Yeah, Bloons is free.

8917
05:07:55,650 --> 05:07:56,530
It is.

8918
05:07:58,350 --> 05:07:59,450
I have to unlock this.

8919
05:07:59,590 --> 05:07:59,770
Oh, wait.

8920
05:07:59,830 --> 05:08:00,730
I should have enough yet.

8921
05:08:01,830 --> 05:08:02,650
It is free.

8922
05:08:03,370 --> 05:08:04,370
That's the best part.

8923
05:08:08,170 --> 05:08:08,570
Firebomb!

8924
05:08:12,680 --> 05:08:13,620
What does it do?

8925
05:08:15,280 --> 05:08:16,020
Oh, okay.

8926
05:08:16,260 --> 05:08:18,040
I was gonna say, what is your job?

8927
05:08:18,900 --> 05:08:20,060
I feel like you haven't...

8928
05:08:20,060 --> 05:08:20,660
Oh, there it is.

8929
05:08:20,800 --> 05:08:22,440
I was like, I feel like you haven't done anything.

8930
05:08:23,740 --> 05:08:24,040
Okay.

8931
05:08:24,240 --> 05:08:24,480
Nice.

8932
05:08:24,580 --> 05:08:25,100
I have the freeze.

8933
05:08:26,680 --> 05:08:27,980
Oh, I mean...

8934
05:08:29,260 --> 05:08:29,860
I mean...

8935
05:08:29,860 --> 05:08:33,360
It was free for me.

8936
05:08:38,680 --> 05:08:42,580
It was free for me, guys.

8937
05:08:46,300 --> 05:08:47,460
Firebomb!

8938
05:08:51,070 --> 05:08:51,870
All right.

8939
05:09:01,440 --> 05:09:03,040
Can I firebomb?

8940
05:09:03,760 --> 05:09:04,920
Firebomb!

8941
05:09:08,360 --> 05:09:10,640
I don't have to upgrade anything at all.

8942
05:09:11,420 --> 05:09:15,680
Wait, I guess I can save for 19,000 just for the sake of it.

8943
05:09:16,160 --> 05:09:17,280
Just for fun.

8944
05:09:18,560 --> 05:09:19,040
Firebomb!

8945
05:09:21,840 --> 05:09:22,840
You know what, fuck it.

8946
05:09:22,860 --> 05:09:24,000
I'll just save it for fun.

8947
05:09:27,800 --> 05:09:28,280
Nice.

8948
05:09:28,920 --> 05:09:29,400
Firebomb!

8949
05:09:31,260 --> 05:09:32,720
Is that 19k yet?

8950
05:09:32,940 --> 05:09:33,920
How do I not have 19k?

8951
05:09:33,960 --> 05:09:34,900
Does this cost money?

8952
05:09:37,440 --> 05:09:39,880
I was like, how do I not have 19k yet?

8953
05:09:48,120 --> 05:09:49,640
Alright, wait, I'm already done.

8954
05:09:50,240 --> 05:09:50,420
Aww.

8955
05:09:52,100 --> 05:09:52,920
Wait, next.

8956
05:09:53,300 --> 05:09:53,840
Wait, free play.

8957
05:09:53,940 --> 05:09:57,340
I wanna... Okay, I wanna try getting the 19k.

8958
05:10:01,280 --> 05:10:02,720
I wanna know what that is like.

8959
05:10:07,760 --> 05:10:08,780
Alright, that's fine.

8960
05:10:11,240 --> 05:10:12,280
We're so close.

8961
05:10:15,240 --> 05:10:17,580
Come on, we're so close to it.

8962
05:10:18,540 --> 05:10:22,500
I wanna have the fucking Apache dark ship.

8963
05:10:23,500 --> 05:10:24,740
That's all I want.

8964
05:10:28,200 --> 05:10:29,240
Nice, okay.

8965
05:10:31,200 --> 05:10:32,980
Give me my firebomb.

8966
05:10:34,560 --> 05:10:35,240
Nice.

8967
05:10:35,600 --> 05:10:37,040
Okay, now he's like...

8968
05:10:38,020 --> 05:10:39,480
Now he's a big boy.

8969
05:10:41,500 --> 05:10:43,560
Okay, now I can actually spend on other money.

8970
05:10:45,640 --> 05:10:46,760
They nerfed it?

8971
05:10:46,840 --> 05:10:47,740
That's possible?

8972
05:10:48,920 --> 05:10:49,460
Fuck it.

8973
05:10:49,520 --> 05:10:50,620
Let's just kill all of it.

8974
05:10:51,540 --> 05:10:52,120
Let's go.

8975
05:10:52,200 --> 05:10:53,320
And we slow it down, too.

8976
05:10:54,440 --> 05:10:56,580
Is there anything else I can upgrade for my...

8977
05:10:56,580 --> 05:10:57,320
Oh, these guys.

8978
05:11:01,200 --> 05:11:02,080
Okay, firebomb!

8979
05:11:02,700 --> 05:11:04,960
I feel like I don't need to recruit anybody else.

8980
05:11:05,180 --> 05:11:05,960
I'm so strong.

8981
05:11:12,700 --> 05:11:13,100
Firebomb!

8982
05:11:17,820 --> 05:11:19,300
Yeah, these guys are so weak.

8983
05:11:22,060 --> 05:11:23,000
Oh, that's true.

8984
05:11:23,100 --> 05:11:24,220
I should just buy farms.

8985
05:11:24,420 --> 05:11:24,720
You're right.

8986
05:11:25,800 --> 05:11:27,120
You know I don't pay attention.

8987
05:11:30,900 --> 05:11:31,960
All right, nice.

8988
05:11:34,460 --> 05:11:35,000
Firebomb!

8989
05:11:35,820 --> 05:11:37,240
I'll get another one, too.

8990
05:11:40,920 --> 05:11:41,380
There you go.

8991
05:11:42,460 --> 05:11:42,560
Oh!

8992
05:11:44,280 --> 05:11:45,480
I should upgrade him.

8993
05:11:47,040 --> 05:11:47,840
There you go.

8994
05:11:48,200 --> 05:11:49,080
I'll slow you down.

8995
05:11:50,640 --> 05:11:52,020
Is this ice too much?

8996
05:11:52,060 --> 05:11:52,640
No, it doesn't.

8997
05:11:52,760 --> 05:11:54,840
I was just paranoid for no reason.

8998
05:11:58,280 --> 05:12:00,600
2,700 marketplace.

8999
05:12:04,180 --> 05:12:06,200
She hit the full auto rifle.

9000
05:12:09,920 --> 05:12:11,180
Badass are so small.

9001
05:12:11,340 --> 05:12:12,340
I mean, they're pretty good.

9002
05:12:13,000 --> 05:12:14,400
Pretty good upgrades.

9003
05:12:15,120 --> 05:12:17,120
I got the max upgrade for the marketplace.

9004
05:12:19,820 --> 05:12:20,460
Firebomb!

9005
05:12:21,620 --> 05:12:23,460
We will slow that down.

9006
05:12:24,100 --> 05:12:24,620
Firebomb!

9007
05:12:24,620 --> 05:12:25,600
And then...

9008
05:12:25,600 --> 05:12:28,320
I want to stay up for this guy's full auto rifle.

9009
05:12:30,040 --> 05:12:31,280
Yeah, you missed trauma.

9010
05:12:32,000 --> 05:12:33,180
That's why I'm here now.

9011
05:12:33,320 --> 05:12:34,440
Because it's cheaper than therapy.

9012
05:12:42,300 --> 05:12:44,520
It's a lot cheaper than therapy.

9013
05:12:49,480 --> 05:12:50,800
It truly is.

9014
05:12:57,320 --> 05:12:59,000
I hope it's not too loud, guys.

9015
05:12:59,000 --> 05:12:59,340
I hope it's not too loud.

9016
05:12:59,340 --> 05:13:01,180
I'll grab another one just for the sake of it.

9017
05:13:06,550 --> 05:13:07,030
Alright.

9018
05:13:07,550 --> 05:13:10,110
I got yelled at by ranked people, too.

9019
05:13:11,670 --> 05:13:13,970
So this is a lot cheaper than therapy.

9020
05:13:20,190 --> 05:13:21,730
Also, I hope it's not too loud.

9021
05:13:23,710 --> 05:13:25,690
I hope it's not too loud, guys.

9022
05:13:25,690 --> 05:13:25,690
Yes.

9023
05:13:32,390 --> 05:13:34,010
That's it, I'm going on strike.

9024
05:13:39,290 --> 05:13:41,310
It's slightly high, I can turn it down a little.

9025
05:13:41,930 --> 05:13:45,190
There you go.

9026
05:13:46,810 --> 05:13:47,870
I hope it's a lot better.

9027
05:13:48,070 --> 05:13:48,550
Is that better?

9028
05:13:52,250 --> 05:13:53,130
Is that better?

9029
05:13:56,010 --> 05:13:58,370
Let's see, I could spend it on...

9030
05:13:58,370 --> 05:14:00,170
Let's just spend it on more money.

9031
05:14:00,590 --> 05:14:02,110
More money, more problems.

9032
05:14:04,670 --> 05:14:05,710
Alright, here we go.

9033
05:14:08,390 --> 05:14:08,830
Nice.

9034
05:14:08,830 --> 05:14:09,970
Therapy is temporary.

9035
05:14:10,190 --> 05:14:11,230
Bloons, exactly.

9036
05:14:11,470 --> 05:14:12,330
Bloons is eternal.

9037
05:14:17,960 --> 05:14:21,720
I make it to... Wait, is this a fast... Oh my god, it is.

9038
05:14:21,960 --> 05:14:22,540
God damn it.

9039
05:14:22,900 --> 05:14:23,840
This is the fastest.

9040
05:14:23,960 --> 05:14:26,500
I was like, can this be a little faster?

9041
05:14:27,060 --> 05:14:28,360
Sadly, it can't be.

9042
05:14:31,660 --> 05:14:32,080
Alright.

9043
05:14:34,880 --> 05:14:35,680
Exactly.

9044
05:14:36,160 --> 05:14:36,760
You know what?

9045
05:14:38,760 --> 05:14:40,260
Just for the sake of it.

9046
05:14:44,300 --> 05:14:45,580
Alright, nice.

9047
05:14:47,720 --> 05:14:48,880
This is my new...

9048
05:14:49,400 --> 05:14:51,280
Friendship ended with Ice Monkey.

9049
05:14:54,400 --> 05:14:55,940
It's sniper time.

9050
05:15:01,230 --> 05:15:03,030
Don't worry, it'll work.

9051
05:15:04,810 --> 05:15:05,870
There we go.

9052
05:15:08,010 --> 05:15:08,890
Firebomb.

9053
05:15:09,450 --> 05:15:09,950
Firebomb.

9054
05:15:11,490 --> 05:15:12,250
No!

9055
05:15:16,670 --> 05:15:17,110
Alright.

9056
05:15:27,950 --> 05:15:29,410
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

9057
05:15:30,310 --> 05:15:31,230
Look at them go.

9058
05:15:38,390 --> 05:15:39,270
Firebomb.

9059
05:15:43,360 --> 05:15:45,120
Okay, we'll do that.

9060
05:15:46,540 --> 05:15:47,940
And then we can...

9061
05:15:49,620 --> 05:15:51,320
We'll slow that down.

9062
05:15:54,780 --> 05:15:59,280
I counted you abandoned Ice Monkey like that.

9063
05:16:00,260 --> 05:16:01,520
It's that simple.

9064
05:16:01,680 --> 05:16:02,420
I lost a turn.

9065
05:16:04,980 --> 05:16:07,260
Today is not a day to feel joy.

9066
05:16:13,740 --> 05:16:16,320
We all have to lose something today.

9067
05:16:21,420 --> 05:16:23,480
We all have to lose.

9068
05:16:29,400 --> 05:16:31,320
It simply is life.

9069
05:16:32,200 --> 05:16:34,060
Welcome to the real world.

9070
05:16:43,040 --> 05:16:44,560
Doom maxing.

9071
05:16:44,880 --> 05:16:46,820
I shall max out my...

9072
05:16:46,820 --> 05:16:47,460
The doom.

9073
05:16:53,500 --> 05:16:54,660
I need four...

9074
05:16:56,020 --> 05:16:56,620
I need four...

9075
05:16:56,620 --> 05:16:57,740
I need to remember to use the firebomb.

9076
05:16:57,900 --> 05:16:58,060
I...

9077
05:16:58,060 --> 05:16:58,500
Because I don't...

9078
05:17:02,940 --> 05:17:03,600
I don't...

9079
05:17:03,600 --> 05:17:04,240
I don't...

9080
05:17:04,240 --> 05:17:06,420
I don't...

9081
05:17:11,250 --> 05:17:11,970
I don't...

9082
05:17:12,930 --> 05:17:13,430
Alright.

9083
05:17:14,150 --> 05:17:15,350
And then we'll do...

9084
05:17:17,130 --> 05:17:19,510
Oh my god, we're gaining so much money!

9085
05:17:21,130 --> 05:17:21,630
Fire!

9086
05:17:21,750 --> 05:17:21,830
Fire!

9087
05:17:21,830 --> 05:17:22,930
Oh wait, firebomb!

9088
05:17:25,510 --> 05:17:29,350
You know what, just for the sake of it, I'm just gonna put this here.

9089
05:17:29,350 --> 05:17:30,110
Fire!

9090
05:17:30,110 --> 05:17:30,510
Just in case.

9091
05:17:33,270 --> 05:17:34,050
Uh...

9092
05:17:38,480 --> 05:17:40,340
Just cause I feel like it.

9093
05:17:41,480 --> 05:17:42,000
Yay!

9094
05:17:43,580 --> 05:17:44,680
There you go.

9095
05:17:47,580 --> 05:17:50,700
This is my one way of feeling anything anymore.

9096
05:17:51,200 --> 05:17:53,460
Just throwing firebombs.

9097
05:17:54,680 --> 05:17:58,300
If I keep throwing firebombs, so I'll feel something.

9098
05:18:07,200 --> 05:18:09,640
The single elimination is actually...

9099
05:18:09,640 --> 05:18:10,180
It hurts.

9100
05:18:12,420 --> 05:18:13,240
That's rough.

9101
05:18:14,560 --> 05:18:16,180
But it is what it is.

9102
05:18:23,260 --> 05:18:25,320
Alright, I don't know if this is a good upgrade.

9103
05:18:25,480 --> 05:18:26,540
I'm just doing it cause I can.

9104
05:18:29,200 --> 05:18:30,600
Oh my god.

9105
05:18:31,660 --> 05:18:32,460
Firebomb.

9106
05:18:40,640 --> 05:18:42,040
Get out of here.

9107
05:18:45,740 --> 05:18:46,300
Oh dude!

9108
05:18:48,900 --> 05:18:50,540
Oh wait, it can crit.

9109
05:18:50,640 --> 05:18:51,380
Wait, that's insane.

9110
05:18:55,720 --> 05:18:56,520
Firebomb!

9111
05:18:58,180 --> 05:18:58,900
Oh shit.

9112
05:18:59,160 --> 05:18:59,580
Freeze!

9113
05:19:00,340 --> 05:19:01,540
Oh shit.

9114
05:19:01,760 --> 05:19:02,060
Okay.

9115
05:19:02,720 --> 05:19:03,520
Um...

9116
05:19:05,440 --> 05:19:08,000
Okay, this is a little worrisome now.

9117
05:19:08,180 --> 05:19:08,720
This...

9118
05:19:11,840 --> 05:19:12,240
Guys...

9119
05:19:12,640 --> 05:19:15,380
You're becoming really, really strong.

9120
05:19:17,000 --> 05:19:17,800
Guys...

9121
05:19:17,800 --> 05:19:20,540
See, I'll make it stronger.

9122
05:19:21,220 --> 05:19:24,100
They might be strong, but I can make it stronger.

9123
05:19:25,680 --> 05:19:27,220
Oh my god.

9124
05:19:28,220 --> 05:19:30,300
Oh my god.

9125
05:19:35,220 --> 05:19:37,340
Okay, maybe I need another helicopter.

9126
05:19:41,060 --> 05:19:41,900
Let's see.

9127
05:19:44,380 --> 05:19:45,000
Alright.

9128
05:19:45,520 --> 05:19:46,040
Maybe...

9129
05:19:46,040 --> 05:19:47,080
Maybe that will help.

9130
05:19:47,460 --> 05:19:48,080
Firebomb!

9131
05:19:50,840 --> 05:19:52,420
Okay, we definitely need that.

9132
05:19:55,140 --> 05:19:56,440
And I'm gonna cool...

9133
05:19:56,440 --> 05:19:56,900
I'm gonna...

9134
05:19:56,900 --> 05:19:59,380
I'm just gonna bring another helicopter into this side.

9135
05:20:00,200 --> 05:20:01,120
I'm just kidding.

9136
05:20:01,820 --> 05:20:03,420
Getting a little scary there.

9137
05:20:05,680 --> 05:20:06,200
Alright.

9138
05:20:07,680 --> 05:20:09,160
Oh my god, I can get the drones.

9139
05:20:09,320 --> 05:20:10,220
Wait, I can get the drones.

9140
05:20:12,100 --> 05:20:12,620
Okay.

9141
05:20:13,140 --> 05:20:14,040
I'll use a mortar.

9142
05:20:15,560 --> 05:20:16,840
And then a snow...

9143
05:20:16,840 --> 05:20:17,000
Slow.

9144
05:20:19,240 --> 05:20:19,680
Firebomb!

9145
05:20:21,020 --> 05:20:21,900
Okay, get 8k.

9146
05:20:22,140 --> 05:20:23,000
And this should be fine.

9147
05:20:28,750 --> 05:20:29,430
Oh my god.

9148
05:20:29,750 --> 05:20:30,350
Oh my god.

9149
05:20:30,430 --> 05:20:31,190
Slow this all down.

9150
05:20:31,590 --> 05:20:32,030
Slow...

9151
05:20:32,530 --> 05:20:33,610
Slow all of...

9152
05:20:33,610 --> 05:20:34,610
Oh my god.

9153
05:20:34,630 --> 05:20:35,110
It's over.

9154
05:20:35,270 --> 05:20:35,730
It's over.

9155
05:20:35,930 --> 05:20:36,270
It's...

9156
05:20:36,270 --> 05:20:37,070
It's actually over.

9157
05:20:37,330 --> 05:20:37,650
It's...

9158
05:20:37,650 --> 05:20:38,130
It might...

9159
05:20:38,130 --> 05:20:39,350
It may or may not be over.

9160
05:20:39,450 --> 05:20:39,850
It's over.

9161
05:20:39,850 --> 05:20:40,530
It's...

9162
05:20:44,990 --> 05:20:46,450
Holy shit.

9163
05:20:47,410 --> 05:20:48,910
Oh, drown 95.

9164
05:20:50,090 --> 05:20:51,430
That's how...

9165
05:20:51,430 --> 05:20:54,030
That's how over it is.

9166
05:20:55,850 --> 05:20:57,410
I was like...

9167
05:20:57,410 --> 05:20:58,630
Yeah, that's...

9168
05:20:58,630 --> 05:21:00,850
Yeah, we're not surviving that.

9169
05:21:01,110 --> 05:21:03,770
We're not surviving that.

9170
05:21:07,160 --> 05:21:08,020
Wait.

9171
05:21:08,240 --> 05:21:08,840
Wait a minute.

9172
05:21:09,560 --> 05:21:10,660
Are you done with our tournament?

9173
05:21:13,920 --> 05:21:14,520
Wait.

9174
05:21:15,060 --> 05:21:15,480
No, not...

9175
05:21:15,480 --> 05:21:16,800
Not that other tournament.

9176
05:21:17,940 --> 05:21:19,160
Are you finished there?

9177
05:21:20,220 --> 05:21:21,120
Let's see.

9178
05:21:22,000 --> 05:21:23,100
I need to check.

9179
05:21:25,000 --> 05:21:26,300
I need to check up there.

9180
05:21:28,220 --> 05:21:30,460
Because I don't see sentinels on.

9181
05:21:33,180 --> 05:21:34,100
No, no, no.

9182
05:21:34,180 --> 05:21:35,120
Not that other one.

9183
05:21:35,480 --> 05:21:37,220
I meant the other tournament.

9184
05:21:41,020 --> 05:21:41,620
Alright.

9185
05:21:41,720 --> 05:21:43,260
I don't see sentinel players on.

9186
05:21:49,650 --> 05:21:50,570
Alright.

9187
05:21:51,270 --> 05:21:52,130
Alright.

9188
05:21:53,750 --> 05:21:54,910
We'll see.

9189
05:22:02,140 --> 05:22:04,220
I don't see...

9190
05:22:04,220 --> 05:22:06,120
I don't see...

9191
05:22:06,120 --> 05:22:08,400
The sentinel's team...

9192
05:22:08,400 --> 05:22:09,680
Stop streaming.

9193
05:22:11,920 --> 05:22:13,380
Oh, okay.

9194
05:22:13,500 --> 05:22:14,540
They're having a team talk.

9195
05:22:14,680 --> 05:22:15,240
Did they lose?

9196
05:22:29,980 --> 05:22:31,060
I don't know.

9197
05:22:31,200 --> 05:22:33,060
I know there was another tournament going on.

9198
05:22:36,160 --> 05:22:38,480
Time to get a different super in.

9199
05:22:48,270 --> 05:22:51,170
I mean, I can have another game.

9200
05:22:52,230 --> 05:22:52,770
Another...

9201
05:22:53,730 --> 05:22:54,270
Another...

9202
05:22:54,270 --> 05:22:55,210
Loons game.

9203
05:22:58,270 --> 05:22:59,310
How much do I need?

9204
05:22:59,470 --> 05:22:59,670
Okay.

9205
05:22:59,870 --> 05:23:01,350
I can put this in.

9206
05:23:01,610 --> 05:23:03,310
And then start it off with that.

9207
05:23:03,930 --> 05:23:05,690
So I can form fireball.

9208
05:23:05,690 --> 05:23:08,010
Oh, that was a bad idea.

9209
05:23:09,590 --> 05:23:11,290
I believe in him.

9210
05:23:13,830 --> 05:23:14,490
I...

9211
05:23:14,490 --> 05:23:15,790
Oh, it's fine.

9212
05:23:15,790 --> 05:23:16,730
It's just one HP.

9213
05:23:17,230 --> 05:23:17,970
That's fine.

9214
05:23:18,150 --> 05:23:18,290
Okay.

9215
05:23:18,470 --> 05:23:19,790
I could...

9216
05:23:19,790 --> 05:23:20,690
Do it.

9217
05:23:21,550 --> 05:23:23,010
Oh, that's bad.

9218
05:23:23,030 --> 05:23:24,230
I fucked up.

9219
05:23:26,950 --> 05:23:28,110
I got reset.

9220
05:23:30,550 --> 05:23:32,170
It's already over.

9221
05:23:33,290 --> 05:23:33,850
Okay.

9222
05:23:34,150 --> 05:23:34,830
I have an idea.

9223
05:23:38,110 --> 05:23:39,050
I have an idea.

9224
05:23:40,050 --> 05:23:41,810
I just have to get...

9225
05:23:41,810 --> 05:23:43,070
Oh, it's already over.

9226
05:23:45,510 --> 05:23:47,530
I forgot how slow...

9227
05:23:47,530 --> 05:23:48,090
Wait, no.

9228
05:23:48,170 --> 05:23:49,170
I think he can make it.

9229
05:23:49,630 --> 05:23:52,250
I think he can clutch this, honestly.

9230
05:23:52,850 --> 05:23:54,350
Yeah, he can clutch this.

9231
05:23:55,150 --> 05:23:56,410
He can clutch this.

9232
05:23:57,330 --> 05:23:58,490
And I'll just do that.

9233
05:23:59,710 --> 05:24:01,190
I believe in him.

9234
05:24:01,390 --> 05:24:02,230
He can clutch this.

9235
05:24:04,410 --> 05:24:05,790
He can clutch this, guys.

9236
05:24:05,790 --> 05:24:06,370
I believe.

9237
05:24:12,770 --> 05:24:13,870
And then, like...

9238
05:24:16,290 --> 05:24:17,270
Oh, my...

9239
05:24:17,270 --> 05:24:18,690
Oh, I'm not playing well.

9240
05:24:20,350 --> 05:24:21,490
I told you.

9241
05:24:21,550 --> 05:24:22,450
He can clutch it.

9242
05:24:23,130 --> 05:24:24,330
And then we're just fast firing.

9243
05:24:24,570 --> 05:24:24,690
Okay.

9244
05:24:24,830 --> 05:24:26,210
Now things get easier.

9245
05:24:31,720 --> 05:24:33,060
And then after that...

9246
05:24:33,060 --> 05:24:34,540
I just need to save my money.

9247
05:24:38,040 --> 05:24:39,340
I just need to get Ice Monkey.

9248
05:24:39,540 --> 05:24:40,020
You know what?

9249
05:24:40,120 --> 05:24:40,960
I think I...

9250
05:24:41,480 --> 05:24:43,580
As long as I have Ice Monkey, everything will be okay.

9251
05:24:44,320 --> 05:24:44,940
That's why I'm there.

9252
05:24:44,980 --> 05:24:46,120
Oh, I need to save for Gwendolyn.

9253
05:24:53,160 --> 05:24:53,620
Don't worry.

9254
05:24:53,680 --> 05:24:54,820
I got Gwendolyn in here.

9255
05:24:58,100 --> 05:25:01,220
I'll get a Super in my team somehow.

9256
05:25:04,140 --> 05:25:08,560
If I can't get Super TF, I know other people whose name starts with Super.

9257
05:25:15,840 --> 05:25:18,160
Guys, I'll get Ice Monkey in here.

9258
05:25:25,640 --> 05:25:26,900
Alright, nice.

9259
05:25:27,900 --> 05:25:28,020
Alright, nice.

9260
05:25:28,200 --> 05:25:32,720
And I just need to get enough money for Ice Monkey.

9261
05:25:32,900 --> 05:25:34,060
And then we clutch these.

9262
05:25:37,860 --> 05:25:38,500
Okay.

9263
05:25:38,700 --> 05:25:39,320
Ice Monkey.

9264
05:25:41,220 --> 05:25:42,500
And then...

9265
05:25:42,500 --> 05:25:43,460
Permafrost.

9266
05:25:47,690 --> 05:25:50,670
And we just need to give him all the upgrades.

9267
05:25:51,990 --> 05:25:52,910
Enhance Freeze.

9268
05:25:52,910 --> 05:25:54,090
And then we'll get another.

9269
05:26:04,380 --> 05:26:04,900
Alright.

9270
05:26:05,080 --> 05:26:06,320
And then we'll get...

9271
05:26:11,090 --> 05:26:12,250
Get another one.

9272
05:26:18,440 --> 05:26:19,480
And then...

9273
05:26:21,400 --> 05:26:21,920
Alright.

9274
05:26:21,960 --> 05:26:22,500
Here we go.

9275
05:26:25,360 --> 05:26:26,140
And then...

9276
05:26:26,140 --> 05:26:26,360
Oh yeah.

9277
05:26:26,360 --> 05:26:26,840
I forgot.

9278
05:26:27,260 --> 05:26:29,100
We're so fucked when they do camo.

9279
05:26:29,500 --> 05:26:30,000
We're so...

9280
05:26:34,820 --> 05:26:35,920
We're so fucked.

9281
05:26:35,980 --> 05:26:37,460
The moment camo starts coming.

9282
05:26:37,460 --> 05:26:37,920
Coming in.

9283
05:26:39,420 --> 05:26:40,200
There we go.

9284
05:26:41,720 --> 05:26:43,200
Now I have two Ice Monkeys.

9285
05:26:43,640 --> 05:26:44,360
Ice Monkey!

9286
05:26:44,480 --> 05:26:44,800
Oh wait.

9287
05:26:45,180 --> 05:26:45,320
Whoops.

9288
05:26:46,020 --> 05:26:47,100
I forgot it has to be here.

9289
05:26:49,340 --> 05:26:49,860
And...

9290
05:26:49,860 --> 05:26:50,880
We can save up now.

9291
05:26:52,680 --> 05:26:53,640
I hope my...

9292
05:26:54,620 --> 05:26:55,960
I hope I didn't fuck up.

9293
05:26:59,280 --> 05:27:00,160
Oh no.

9294
05:27:01,040 --> 05:27:01,800
Oh no.

9295
05:27:02,000 --> 05:27:03,680
Can I actually save up here?

9296
05:27:05,460 --> 05:27:06,160
Don't worry.

9297
05:27:06,160 --> 05:27:07,470
I have my firebomb.

9298
05:27:09,260 --> 05:27:10,000
I have my firebomb.

9299
05:27:10,000 --> 05:27:10,320
Oh no.

9300
05:27:11,340 --> 05:27:13,200
I don't know if I'm allowed...

9301
05:27:13,200 --> 05:27:13,900
I don't know.

9302
05:27:14,580 --> 05:27:15,180
Don't worry.

9303
05:27:16,000 --> 05:27:16,370
Firebomb!

9304
05:27:17,920 --> 05:27:18,760
Don't worry.

9305
05:27:18,860 --> 05:27:20,240
I believe in firebomb.

9306
05:27:20,700 --> 05:27:22,120
Oh this is bad.

9307
05:27:23,120 --> 05:27:25,360
I still believe in firebomb.

9308
05:27:25,740 --> 05:27:26,220
Oh nice.

9309
05:27:27,300 --> 05:27:28,040
Helicopter.

9310
05:27:30,600 --> 05:27:31,240
Helicopter.

9311
05:27:31,420 --> 05:27:31,940
Helicopter.

9312
05:27:32,240 --> 05:27:33,820
And then we need...

9313
05:27:34,500 --> 05:27:36,120
800 for an upgrade.

9314
05:27:38,360 --> 05:27:38,760
It's fine.

9315
05:27:39,420 --> 05:27:40,060
Firebomb.

9316
05:27:40,620 --> 05:27:41,820
We're almost there.

9317
05:27:45,740 --> 05:27:46,960
Oh my god.

9318
05:27:47,260 --> 05:27:47,380
Okay.

9319
05:27:47,500 --> 05:27:47,820
It's okay.

9320
05:27:49,160 --> 05:27:49,620
Okay.

9321
05:27:49,700 --> 05:27:50,260
And then 500.

9322
05:27:51,260 --> 05:27:51,880
There you go.

9323
05:27:53,840 --> 05:27:54,480
Firebomb!

9324
05:28:04,360 --> 05:28:04,880
Firebomb!

9325
05:28:12,880 --> 05:28:13,400
Okay.

9326
05:28:15,320 --> 05:28:17,200
I have the power of firebomb...

9327
05:28:17,860 --> 05:28:18,680
By my side.

9328
05:28:19,940 --> 05:28:20,460
Wait.

9329
05:28:20,540 --> 05:28:22,420
My guy doesn't know how to deal with camo.

9330
05:28:22,820 --> 05:28:22,900
Okay.

9331
05:28:22,960 --> 05:28:23,440
There you go.

9332
05:28:28,050 --> 05:28:28,570
Firebomb!

9333
05:28:29,550 --> 05:28:32,970
Why have glue when I have ice?

9334
05:28:36,430 --> 05:28:36,990
Okay.

9335
05:28:37,090 --> 05:28:37,970
And I'll put him here.

9336
05:28:38,130 --> 05:28:39,130
Now he's a cool guy.

9337
05:28:40,050 --> 05:28:42,530
Honestly, the freeze guy was so clutch.

9338
05:28:42,530 --> 05:28:44,050
I don't know how to make him.

9339
05:28:45,110 --> 05:28:47,890
How do I make him so he has the freeze power?

9340
05:28:48,970 --> 05:28:51,430
That guy was actually so clutch in my run.

9341
05:28:51,730 --> 05:28:53,150
I don't know the...

9342
05:28:53,150 --> 05:28:53,910
The pathway.

9343
05:28:56,850 --> 05:28:58,450
What's the pathway to get it?

9344
05:29:08,060 --> 05:29:09,020
The middle one?

9345
05:29:09,120 --> 05:29:09,580
This one?

9346
05:29:09,740 --> 05:29:09,940
Okay.

9347
05:29:10,040 --> 05:29:10,680
I'll focus that.

9348
05:29:12,100 --> 05:29:12,580
Firebomb!

9349
05:29:16,600 --> 05:29:18,520
I'll focus on getting the ice freeze.

9350
05:29:18,700 --> 05:29:19,500
I think that would be...

9351
05:29:19,500 --> 05:29:19,780
Wait.

9352
05:29:19,880 --> 05:29:20,540
Actually, no.

9353
05:29:20,640 --> 05:29:21,600
Let's get another helicopter.

9354
05:29:21,760 --> 05:29:22,580
Because I don't trust myself.

9355
05:29:23,360 --> 05:29:24,820
I don't trust myself anymore.

9356
05:29:25,540 --> 05:29:27,260
Today's been a weird day.

9357
05:29:27,560 --> 05:29:27,880
Okay.

9358
05:29:33,040 --> 05:29:35,460
What I think is right is no longer right.

9359
05:29:35,600 --> 05:29:36,300
What I...

9360
05:29:42,800 --> 05:29:43,220
Okay.

9361
05:29:43,700 --> 05:29:44,120
Nice.

9362
05:29:45,680 --> 05:29:46,300
Oh, no.

9363
05:29:46,380 --> 05:29:46,460
Wait.

9364
05:29:46,520 --> 05:29:47,040
That's not good.

9365
05:29:53,500 --> 05:29:54,060
All right.

9366
05:29:54,260 --> 05:29:55,740
Let me grab him.

9367
05:29:55,940 --> 05:29:58,500
And I can upgrade the more...

9368
05:29:59,220 --> 05:29:59,800
All right.

9369
05:30:01,800 --> 05:30:03,400
I need to get the middle one, right?

9370
05:30:03,760 --> 05:30:04,180
This...

9371
05:30:04,180 --> 05:30:04,520
Oh, wait.

9372
05:30:04,720 --> 05:30:06,040
I should actually...

9373
05:30:06,640 --> 05:30:07,480
Upgrade him!

9374
05:30:07,480 --> 05:30:09,580
I forgot about that guy.

9375
05:30:09,900 --> 05:30:11,600
I forgot he existed.

9376
05:30:15,920 --> 05:30:16,400
Firebomb!

9377
05:30:19,140 --> 05:30:19,620
Yeah.

9378
05:30:19,720 --> 05:30:20,960
I realized I'm a little fucked.

9379
05:30:21,100 --> 05:30:21,860
Because I was like...

9380
05:30:21,860 --> 05:30:22,100
Wait a minute.

9381
05:30:22,220 --> 05:30:23,520
They're going to send in the big boys soon.

9382
05:30:24,000 --> 05:30:25,840
I don't have anybody that counters that.

9383
05:30:28,320 --> 05:30:29,580
Because I literally...

9384
05:30:29,580 --> 05:30:32,280
I was able to clutch it because of like...

9385
05:30:32,280 --> 05:30:34,820
That guy that like did the whole free shit.

9386
05:30:41,110 --> 05:30:42,510
Everything I know is wrong.

9387
05:30:43,270 --> 05:30:44,490
It truly is.

9388
05:30:48,150 --> 05:30:48,630
Firebomb!

9389
05:30:50,330 --> 05:30:50,810
Okay.

9390
05:30:51,030 --> 05:30:52,110
And then we need a snowstorm.

9391
05:30:52,230 --> 05:30:52,270
Yeah.

9392
05:30:52,350 --> 05:30:53,250
This one was so good.

9393
05:30:53,390 --> 05:30:53,850
We need that.

9394
05:31:01,050 --> 05:31:02,310
And then 4,000.

9395
05:31:07,820 --> 05:31:09,520
I can't do any upgrades yet.

9396
05:31:09,540 --> 05:31:11,220
Because I want to save up for...

9397
05:31:11,900 --> 05:31:13,980
I want to save up for this one.

9398
05:31:15,160 --> 05:31:16,060
We're almost there.

9399
05:31:17,840 --> 05:31:18,540
There you go.

9400
05:31:18,900 --> 05:31:19,060
Wait.

9401
05:31:19,180 --> 05:31:19,540
That's not...

9402
05:31:19,540 --> 05:31:19,760
Oh, wait.

9403
05:31:19,780 --> 05:31:20,040
It is.

9404
05:31:20,180 --> 05:31:20,320
Okay.

9405
05:31:20,420 --> 05:31:20,620
Nice.

9406
05:31:21,920 --> 05:31:23,140
I think I need two then.

9407
05:31:25,420 --> 05:31:25,820
Firebomb!

9408
05:31:26,040 --> 05:31:26,140
Okay.

9409
05:31:26,180 --> 05:31:27,580
Now I can spend more money on stuff.

9410
05:31:31,820 --> 05:31:32,300
All right.

9411
05:31:32,440 --> 05:31:32,900
Oh, no.

9412
05:31:32,980 --> 05:31:33,560
I should have...

9413
05:31:33,560 --> 05:31:33,860
Okay.

9414
05:31:35,500 --> 05:31:37,280
Oh, I should spend money on money.

9415
05:31:38,160 --> 05:31:39,180
I'm so dumb.

9416
05:31:41,980 --> 05:31:42,560
Uh...

9417
05:31:42,560 --> 05:31:43,520
Spend money on money.

9418
05:31:45,260 --> 05:31:46,440
What am I doing?

9419
05:31:47,580 --> 05:31:48,740
Money on money!

9420
05:31:51,820 --> 05:31:52,400
Slow.

9421
05:31:56,470 --> 05:31:57,550
No, it's fine.

9422
05:31:57,690 --> 05:31:58,510
We don't need water.

9423
05:31:59,930 --> 05:32:03,270
We don't need water in my land monkey area.

9424
05:32:06,790 --> 05:32:07,810
Water's a sin.

9425
05:32:09,190 --> 05:32:09,250
Water's a sin.

9426
05:32:09,250 --> 05:32:09,390
All right.

9427
05:32:09,550 --> 05:32:09,870
Nice.

9428
05:32:11,450 --> 05:32:11,790
Firebomb!

9429
05:32:14,590 --> 05:32:15,890
Put more ice monkeys, too.

9430
05:32:18,530 --> 05:32:19,570
He's just gonna chill there.

9431
05:32:21,010 --> 05:32:21,330
All right.

9432
05:32:21,430 --> 05:32:21,870
I need to save...

9433
05:32:21,870 --> 05:32:22,130
I forgot.

9434
05:32:22,170 --> 05:32:23,170
I need to save up for...

9435
05:32:23,170 --> 05:32:23,750
the other...

9436
05:32:24,430 --> 05:32:24,990
the other...

9437
05:32:24,990 --> 05:32:25,110
the other guy.

9438
05:32:29,370 --> 05:32:30,850
Hey, I feel like...

9439
05:32:30,850 --> 05:32:31,030
Okay.

9440
05:32:31,150 --> 05:32:32,310
This guy can be the other one.

9441
05:32:34,290 --> 05:32:34,850
Firebomb!

9442
05:32:37,710 --> 05:32:39,330
We can just drink soda.

9443
05:32:40,510 --> 05:32:41,070
Don't...

9444
05:32:41,070 --> 05:32:42,010
Don't just drink soda.

9445
05:32:42,290 --> 05:32:43,070
I'm just...

9446
05:32:43,070 --> 05:32:44,610
Don't just drink soda, guys.

9447
05:32:44,790 --> 05:32:45,450
It's not...

9448
05:32:45,450 --> 05:32:46,490
not good.

9449
05:32:49,590 --> 05:32:50,150
Firebomb!

9450
05:32:52,830 --> 05:32:53,290
Nice!

9451
05:32:53,430 --> 05:32:53,930
He leveled up!

9452
05:32:57,940 --> 05:32:58,400
Okay.

9453
05:32:58,740 --> 05:32:59,800
And then we need...

9454
05:32:59,800 --> 05:33:00,280
4k.

9455
05:33:02,340 --> 05:33:02,800
Nice.

9456
05:33:04,960 --> 05:33:05,960
Then we'll do that.

9457
05:33:07,400 --> 05:33:08,580
And then we'll do...

9458
05:33:08,580 --> 05:33:09,420
Now we have two.

9459
05:33:09,640 --> 05:33:09,820
Wait.

9460
05:33:09,960 --> 05:33:10,840
We don't have two?

9461
05:33:10,920 --> 05:33:11,160
Oh, wait.

9462
05:33:11,200 --> 05:33:11,500
We do.

9463
05:33:11,980 --> 05:33:12,320
Okay.

9464
05:33:12,320 --> 05:33:13,080
We have two now.

9465
05:33:13,680 --> 05:33:14,140
Okay.

9466
05:33:15,440 --> 05:33:17,210
We need 2k, so...

9467
05:33:22,850 --> 05:33:23,310
Firebomb!

9468
05:33:23,490 --> 05:33:23,570
Okay.

9469
05:33:23,830 --> 05:33:24,290
Marketplace.

9470
05:33:29,900 --> 05:33:31,700
Slow down, and I'll do that...

9471
05:33:31,700 --> 05:33:33,000
Just because I feel like it.

9472
05:33:33,900 --> 05:33:35,260
Because I want to feel something...

9473
05:33:35,260 --> 05:33:35,820
In my life.

9474
05:33:36,440 --> 05:33:36,520
Oh.

9475
05:33:41,840 --> 05:33:42,400
Firebomb!

9476
05:33:43,860 --> 05:33:44,420
Alright.

9477
05:33:47,380 --> 05:33:48,440
Okay, nice.

9478
05:33:48,960 --> 05:33:50,480
And then...

9479
05:33:50,480 --> 05:33:52,240
I guess I could go another sniper.

9480
05:33:52,960 --> 05:33:53,820
It wouldn't hurt.

9481
05:33:57,100 --> 05:33:57,840
Alright, nice.

9482
05:33:58,000 --> 05:33:58,120
Okay.

9483
05:33:59,280 --> 05:34:01,160
Slow that down, and then...

9484
05:34:01,160 --> 05:34:01,860
We'll do Mortar.

9485
05:34:02,300 --> 05:34:03,560
Just because we can, anyway.

9486
05:34:03,920 --> 05:34:04,240
And then...

9487
05:34:04,240 --> 05:34:04,840
Firebomb!

9488
05:34:04,960 --> 05:34:06,000
And we'll slow it down.

9489
05:34:06,540 --> 05:34:07,600
And then we'll...

9490
05:34:07,600 --> 05:34:08,580
Give him that upgrade.

9491
05:34:09,880 --> 05:34:11,740
And I'll save up for the 6k one.

9492
05:34:11,900 --> 05:34:13,240
I think it'd be helpful, anyway.

9493
05:34:17,440 --> 05:34:17,880
Fire...

9494
05:34:17,880 --> 05:34:18,000
Oh!

9495
05:34:18,540 --> 05:34:18,980
Firebomb!

9496
05:34:20,140 --> 05:34:21,840
Slow that down.

9497
05:34:22,400 --> 05:34:23,240
And then we'll do that.

9498
05:34:29,500 --> 05:34:30,520
Firebomb!

9499
05:34:33,160 --> 05:34:34,900
Slow him down.

9500
05:34:40,520 --> 05:34:41,540
Firebomb!

9501
05:34:42,780 --> 05:34:43,480
Oh, yay!

9502
05:34:43,660 --> 05:34:44,080
Level up!

9503
05:34:46,080 --> 05:34:48,100
I'll use all of that, just because I can.

9504
05:34:48,680 --> 05:34:50,420
And I can buy the...

9505
05:34:50,420 --> 05:34:52,920
I feel like I definitely need this.

9506
05:34:56,260 --> 05:34:57,420
I need this.

9507
05:35:01,740 --> 05:35:03,360
Yeah, that one I need.

9508
05:35:04,620 --> 05:35:05,360
Unlock it.

9509
05:35:07,220 --> 05:35:08,260
A firebomb!

9510
05:35:08,640 --> 05:35:10,180
And then we'll grab another helicopter.

9511
05:35:11,100 --> 05:35:12,140
Oh, I can upgrade you.

9512
05:35:12,140 --> 05:35:14,760
Oh, I should upgrade you more.

9513
05:35:16,500 --> 05:35:16,980
Yeah.

9514
05:35:21,720 --> 05:35:23,160
I need more money.

9515
05:35:27,430 --> 05:35:28,190
Money!

9516
05:35:31,570 --> 05:35:32,970
Give me money!

9517
05:35:38,020 --> 05:35:38,780
Okay.

9518
05:35:42,280 --> 05:35:43,800
Oh, firebomb!

9519
05:35:44,780 --> 05:35:46,020
Thank you, guys.

9520
05:35:46,300 --> 05:35:47,120
My brain is...

9521
05:35:47,120 --> 05:35:49,420
Sorry, I can't give you guys actual commentary.

9522
05:35:49,900 --> 05:35:53,260
I'm literally just brain-rotting bloons right now.

9523
05:35:53,460 --> 05:35:54,020
I...

9524
05:35:58,300 --> 05:36:00,700
There's no commentary.

9525
05:36:00,700 --> 05:36:01,860
I'm just blooning.

9526
05:36:06,260 --> 05:36:07,160
Sorry.

9527
05:36:07,520 --> 05:36:07,960
Sorry.

9528
05:36:08,260 --> 05:36:10,120
I'm literally just...

9529
05:36:10,120 --> 05:36:12,000
I'm just blooning right now.

9530
05:36:12,000 --> 05:36:12,720
I...

9531
05:36:12,720 --> 05:36:12,820
I...

9532
05:36:15,880 --> 05:36:17,100
This is...

9533
05:36:17,100 --> 05:36:19,020
Literally, in my head, it's just...

9534
05:36:19,020 --> 05:36:20,320
Firebomb!

9535
05:36:24,000 --> 05:36:26,640
I smoke firebomb!

9536
05:36:29,700 --> 05:36:30,420
Firebomb!

9537
05:36:32,160 --> 05:36:33,200
Alright, there you go.

9538
05:36:33,480 --> 05:36:34,280
That should be good.

9539
05:36:39,950 --> 05:36:40,430
Uh...

9540
05:36:41,950 --> 05:36:43,290
Get him out of the way.

9541
05:36:44,730 --> 05:36:46,270
What the fuck is that?

9542
05:36:49,490 --> 05:36:49,970
Okay.

9543
05:36:52,210 --> 05:36:53,770
I'll just have another helicopter.

9544
05:36:53,970 --> 05:36:54,370
Fuck it.

9545
05:36:54,730 --> 05:36:55,550
Just for the sake.

9546
05:36:56,590 --> 05:36:58,250
The more helicopters, the better.

9547
05:37:01,530 --> 05:37:02,970
Just have fun.

9548
05:37:03,210 --> 05:37:04,310
Go wild, everybody.

9549
05:37:05,070 --> 05:37:06,730
Just fucking go wild.

9550
05:37:07,930 --> 05:37:09,590
Have the time of your life.

9551
05:37:13,450 --> 05:37:15,750
Have the best time of your life.

9552
05:37:15,970 --> 05:37:16,690
Firebomb!

9553
05:37:19,110 --> 05:37:20,410
We're just...

9554
05:37:20,410 --> 05:37:22,050
We're just lunars.

9555
05:37:23,150 --> 05:37:24,830
I want to do Superman here.

9556
05:37:25,930 --> 05:37:27,270
Superman is so strong, apparently.

9557
05:37:29,190 --> 05:37:29,970
There you go.

9558
05:37:30,230 --> 05:37:30,750
And then...

9559
05:37:31,670 --> 05:37:33,650
Oh yeah, I should do knockback, right?

9560
05:37:33,750 --> 05:37:34,810
Knockback is crazy.

9561
05:37:43,670 --> 05:37:44,550
My other farms?

9562
05:37:44,830 --> 05:37:46,050
Yeah, just a little bit.

9563
05:37:46,130 --> 05:37:47,270
But I want to upgrade my Superman.

9564
05:37:52,350 --> 05:37:52,830
Uh...

9565
05:37:52,830 --> 05:37:53,890
I want to get this.

9566
05:37:54,590 --> 05:37:56,210
I heard the knockback is super strong.

9567
05:38:08,970 --> 05:38:11,530
How long is this fucking team talk?

9568
05:38:13,850 --> 05:38:14,990
Did they lose?

9569
05:38:14,990 --> 05:38:17,230
Okay, somebody who watches streams.

9570
05:38:17,490 --> 05:38:18,370
Did they lose?

9571
05:38:19,070 --> 05:38:21,110
Why is this team talk so long?

9572
05:38:34,440 --> 05:38:36,360
This is a...

9573
05:38:36,360 --> 05:38:36,640
Real...

9574
05:38:36,640 --> 05:38:39,500
Alright, someone watch a bot and tell me if they lost or not.

9575
05:38:39,760 --> 05:38:41,960
I feel like they might have lost because like...

9576
05:38:42,600 --> 05:38:43,560
Because like...

9577
05:38:43,560 --> 05:38:45,820
There's no way this team talk is like...

9578
05:38:45,820 --> 05:38:46,260
So long.

9579
05:38:46,600 --> 05:38:47,200
Oh, he was?

9580
05:38:47,400 --> 05:38:48,060
What did he say?

9581
05:38:52,830 --> 05:38:54,850
I should put the spikes in here again.

9582
05:38:57,910 --> 05:38:59,270
No, I meant the...

9583
05:38:59,270 --> 05:38:59,710
I don't...

9584
05:38:59,710 --> 05:39:00,050
I don't...

9585
05:39:00,050 --> 05:39:02,610
I've already deleted that tournament from...

9586
05:39:03,410 --> 05:39:05,470
I meant the Sentinels team.

9587
05:39:05,590 --> 05:39:06,170
Did they lose?

9588
05:39:17,760 --> 05:39:19,060
I need to know.

9589
05:39:19,560 --> 05:39:20,920
Somebody check the...

9590
05:39:20,920 --> 05:39:22,300
They had a tournament too.

9591
05:39:27,500 --> 05:39:29,600
So I'm just curious if they won or not.

9592
05:39:34,040 --> 05:39:34,460
Okay.

9593
05:39:40,600 --> 05:39:41,980
Just get this out of here.

9594
05:39:42,120 --> 05:39:43,440
And then we'll bring more helicopters.

9595
05:39:43,620 --> 05:39:44,920
Because I don't know what to upgrade anymore.

9596
05:39:44,920 --> 05:39:46,130
I don't know what to upgrade anymore.

9597
05:39:48,440 --> 05:39:49,920
Alright, and then...

9598
05:39:52,280 --> 05:39:53,920
No, we got knocked out.

9599
05:39:59,190 --> 05:40:01,970
I just want to know how long this bot review is.

9600
05:40:06,240 --> 05:40:06,740
Alright.

9601
05:40:09,360 --> 05:40:10,360
And then...

9602
05:40:10,360 --> 05:40:11,080
Superman!

9603
05:40:11,800 --> 05:40:13,000
Why am I whoo?

9604
05:40:14,940 --> 05:40:15,880
Alright, you're right.

9605
05:40:16,040 --> 05:40:17,100
We should save up for it.

9606
05:40:17,280 --> 05:40:18,090
Bro, it's 21k.

9607
05:40:18,090 --> 05:40:18,590
21k.

9608
05:40:19,450 --> 05:40:21,030
Oh wait, I forgot about this guy.

9609
05:40:22,970 --> 05:40:24,190
Oh, I forgot about you too.

9610
05:40:25,390 --> 05:40:25,890
Don't worry.

9611
05:40:26,590 --> 05:40:26,990
Eventually...

9612
05:40:26,990 --> 05:40:27,570
You're...

9613
05:40:27,570 --> 05:40:28,510
Still on...

9614
05:40:28,510 --> 05:40:29,170
Oh my god.

9615
05:40:29,390 --> 05:40:30,390
That's a lot of you guys.

9616
05:40:31,430 --> 05:40:32,570
Oh, is that the last one?

9617
05:40:32,650 --> 05:40:33,250
Oh, I did it.

9618
05:40:33,330 --> 05:40:33,650
Yay!

9619
05:40:40,790 --> 05:40:41,850
I did it!

9620
05:40:43,510 --> 05:40:43,910
Alright.

9621
05:40:44,230 --> 05:40:44,630
Nice.

9622
05:40:44,850 --> 05:40:45,570
Is that all of them?

9623
05:40:45,790 --> 05:40:46,050
Alright.

9624
05:40:46,230 --> 05:40:46,710
Now I...

9625
05:40:46,710 --> 05:40:46,950
Wait.

9626
05:40:47,130 --> 05:40:47,250
Okay.

9627
05:40:47,310 --> 05:40:48,650
Which hero is actually the best?

9628
05:40:48,790 --> 05:40:49,950
I unlocked a lot of them.

9629
05:40:50,690 --> 05:40:51,790
Which one's the best?

9630
05:40:54,630 --> 05:40:55,570
By lock...

9631
05:40:55,570 --> 05:40:56,970
A lot of them, I have three...

9632
05:40:56,970 --> 05:40:57,850
I have two more.

9633
05:41:06,330 --> 05:41:08,710
I have him, him, him, and him.

9634
05:41:09,450 --> 05:41:12,350
I have Jones, Greenfoot, and...

9635
05:41:13,970 --> 05:41:15,490
Guys, I have four people.

9636
05:41:15,670 --> 05:41:17,630
I meant a lot of them, as in four people.

9637
05:41:21,600 --> 05:41:25,540
I have Jones, Greenfoot, Gwendolyn, and Quincy.

9638
05:41:25,540 --> 05:41:26,960
Who's the best one?

9639
05:41:29,860 --> 05:41:30,540
Greenfoot?

9640
05:41:30,680 --> 05:41:31,340
What does he do?

9641
05:41:35,490 --> 05:41:36,670
Ben for Eek?

9642
05:41:36,750 --> 05:41:38,230
I don't have them, guys!

9643
05:41:38,450 --> 05:41:40,230
I have four things!

9644
05:41:40,750 --> 05:41:41,270
I...

9645
05:41:41,270 --> 05:41:42,690
I have...

9646
05:41:42,690 --> 05:41:45,430
Guys, I have four things!

9647
05:41:46,450 --> 05:41:47,030
Who...

9648
05:41:47,030 --> 05:41:48,510
Who the fuck is Ben?

9649
05:41:49,190 --> 05:41:49,770
I...

9650
05:41:51,210 --> 05:41:52,490
Alright, we'll try him.

9651
05:41:53,270 --> 05:41:53,850
We'll try him.

9652
05:41:58,600 --> 05:41:59,180
Alright.

9653
05:41:59,900 --> 05:42:00,440
How does...

9654
05:42:00,440 --> 05:42:01,240
What does Ben do?

9655
05:42:02,800 --> 05:42:03,980
Ben, what do you do?

9656
05:42:03,980 --> 05:42:04,310
I don't know.

9657
05:42:06,520 --> 05:42:07,180
Oh!

9658
05:42:08,900 --> 05:42:10,220
Oh, he's good!

9659
05:42:18,340 --> 05:42:19,480
Go, Ben!

9660
05:42:19,700 --> 05:42:20,040
Go!

9661
05:42:20,400 --> 05:42:20,980
What is your name?

9662
05:42:21,120 --> 05:42:21,980
Greenfoot, go!

9663
05:42:23,800 --> 05:42:25,300
I should speed it up.

9664
05:42:26,160 --> 05:42:27,520
He's like, Kamehameha!

9665
05:42:35,210 --> 05:42:35,870
Alright.

9666
05:42:36,270 --> 05:42:37,970
That's almost enough for an ice monkey.

9667
05:42:41,970 --> 05:42:42,630
Nice.

9668
05:42:43,910 --> 05:42:45,150
That's all we needed.

9669
05:42:51,650 --> 05:42:53,630
Koji's almost good enough for it.

9670
05:42:59,070 --> 05:42:59,710
Alright.

9671
05:43:01,330 --> 05:43:02,310
Wait, what?

9672
05:43:03,170 --> 05:43:03,810
Oh!

9673
05:43:04,030 --> 05:43:05,450
It's because he can't see!

9674
05:43:07,810 --> 05:43:08,450
Oh!

9675
05:43:09,830 --> 05:43:11,910
Where should I place it, then?

9676
05:43:13,430 --> 05:43:16,050
Wait, is Sniper even good at that point?

9677
05:43:16,330 --> 05:43:18,130
I don't think Sniper's good at that point.

9678
05:43:25,370 --> 05:43:26,610
On the water tower?

9679
05:43:26,750 --> 05:43:27,150
I can?

9680
05:43:27,350 --> 05:43:27,790
Oh!

9681
05:43:28,410 --> 05:43:29,810
Wait, he can go high ground?

9682
05:43:30,950 --> 05:43:32,130
Wait, that's OP!

9683
05:43:33,290 --> 05:43:34,350
What does this do?

9684
05:43:35,930 --> 05:43:37,010
What do you do?

9685
05:43:38,070 --> 05:43:39,370
What did you do?

9686
05:43:44,250 --> 05:43:44,810
Oh!

9687
05:43:46,470 --> 05:43:47,790
Where did I put it?

9688
05:43:48,290 --> 05:43:49,650
I put it there.

9689
05:43:51,170 --> 05:43:51,730
Alright, nice.

9690
05:43:52,150 --> 05:43:53,390
I could just keep putting them.

9691
05:43:58,030 --> 05:43:59,030
Nice, monkey.

9692
05:43:59,550 --> 05:43:59,910
Oh, what?

9693
05:44:01,030 --> 05:44:02,110
What is he doing?

9694
05:44:02,610 --> 05:44:04,170
What are you doing, you little freak?

9695
05:44:07,650 --> 05:44:08,630
Alright, nice.

9696
05:44:12,110 --> 05:44:13,150
And then...

9697
05:44:14,150 --> 05:44:15,690
I'll do Deep Freeze here.

9698
05:44:19,090 --> 05:44:19,970
Alright, nice.

9699
05:44:21,610 --> 05:44:22,990
Oh, the totem snows?

9700
05:44:23,110 --> 05:44:23,590
Oh, okay.

9701
05:44:23,910 --> 05:44:24,690
That's good to know.

9702
05:44:26,590 --> 05:44:28,050
Alright, I'm going to save up for...

9703
05:44:28,050 --> 05:44:29,670
I'm going to save up for...

9704
05:44:32,910 --> 05:44:35,410
Okay, Ice Monkey, you're a little useless down here.

9705
05:44:37,510 --> 05:44:40,390
I thought you could do better, but apparently I was wrong.

9706
05:44:41,550 --> 05:44:42,390
Oh, wait, never mind.

9707
05:44:42,610 --> 05:44:42,890
JK.

9708
05:44:43,730 --> 05:44:45,170
JK, you're hitting a little bit.

9709
05:44:45,570 --> 05:44:46,710
You're hitting them a little bit.

9710
05:44:46,810 --> 05:44:47,230
Good job.

9711
05:44:50,410 --> 05:44:51,430
Oh, okay.

9712
05:44:51,630 --> 05:44:53,370
Maybe I should start putting more...

9713
05:44:53,370 --> 05:44:53,870
No, it's okay.

9714
05:44:53,990 --> 05:44:55,270
My sniper guy is doing okay.

9715
05:44:56,070 --> 05:44:56,430
Alright.

9716
05:44:58,510 --> 05:44:59,530
I'll put you here.

9717
05:45:01,190 --> 05:45:02,210
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

9718
05:45:05,010 --> 05:45:05,990
Get in here.

9719
05:45:07,170 --> 05:45:07,950
Alright, nice.

9720
05:45:14,240 --> 05:45:15,740
Is there another...

9721
05:45:16,440 --> 05:45:17,620
area he can stand on?

9722
05:45:17,860 --> 05:45:18,240
No.

9723
05:45:19,340 --> 05:45:20,100
There isn't.

9724
05:45:21,540 --> 05:45:23,020
Put more over here.

9725
05:45:24,920 --> 05:45:27,720
And I'll save up for another...

9726
05:45:28,580 --> 05:45:30,200
He does well with Druid.

9727
05:45:30,300 --> 05:45:31,240
We don't care about them.

9728
05:45:32,080 --> 05:45:32,400
Hahaha.

9729
05:45:35,720 --> 05:45:36,480
Let's go.

9730
05:45:36,960 --> 05:45:37,360
Alright.

9731
05:45:38,080 --> 05:45:38,840
That's alright.

9732
05:45:39,100 --> 05:45:39,860
We don't need them.

9733
05:45:42,860 --> 05:45:44,760
Druids have no rights in this area.

9734
05:45:50,230 --> 05:45:51,250
Except for him.

9735
05:45:51,410 --> 05:45:52,150
He's my exception.

9736
05:45:54,950 --> 05:45:57,950
Because he's a little more special than a regular Druid.

9737
05:45:59,410 --> 05:46:01,330
Then you're not using his kit.

9738
05:46:01,570 --> 05:46:02,330
That's so...

9739
05:46:02,330 --> 05:46:04,010
That's the risk I'm willing to take.

9740
05:46:09,570 --> 05:46:11,070
And then I'll put here.

9741
05:46:12,510 --> 05:46:16,130
Oh, I forgot to upgrade anything related to camo.

9742
05:46:16,610 --> 05:46:17,250
That's...

9743
05:46:17,250 --> 05:46:17,510
Hahaha.

9744
05:46:19,610 --> 05:46:20,330
Whoops.

9745
05:46:20,710 --> 05:46:21,290
I...

9746
05:46:21,290 --> 05:46:21,530
Hahaha.

9747
05:46:23,310 --> 05:46:24,030
Oopsie.

9748
05:46:24,410 --> 05:46:25,090
I should get...

9749
05:46:25,090 --> 05:46:26,210
I should deal with that.

9750
05:46:27,330 --> 05:46:28,810
I should fix that.

9751
05:46:30,470 --> 05:46:31,810
I almost forgot.

9752
05:46:32,430 --> 05:46:35,230
I almost forgot how important camo is.

9753
05:46:37,110 --> 05:46:38,110
That's fine.

9754
05:46:40,690 --> 05:46:41,930
And then we'll do that.

9755
05:46:44,950 --> 05:46:46,230
And then...

9756
05:46:49,290 --> 05:46:49,930
Rise!

9757
05:46:51,910 --> 05:46:53,190
We'll refreeze.

9758
05:46:54,150 --> 05:46:54,870
Deep freeze.

9759
05:46:55,710 --> 05:46:56,350
Permafrost.

9760
05:46:56,850 --> 05:46:58,770
And then we'll save up for the...

9761
05:46:58,770 --> 05:46:59,650
The cool one.

9762
05:47:00,950 --> 05:47:01,910
Oh, we're almost...

9763
05:47:01,910 --> 05:47:02,150
Oh, wait.

9764
05:47:02,210 --> 05:47:02,770
This is easy.

9765
05:47:02,870 --> 05:47:04,050
I forgot I'm on easy mode.

9766
05:47:09,050 --> 05:47:10,470
I'm on easy mode.

9767
05:47:10,470 --> 05:47:12,270
I don't have to think too much.

9768
05:47:12,750 --> 05:47:14,050
I forgot about that.

9769
05:47:14,770 --> 05:47:15,710
What am I thinking?

9770
05:47:21,450 --> 05:47:21,850
Rise!

9771
05:47:25,910 --> 05:47:26,690
Alright, nice.

9772
05:47:26,830 --> 05:47:28,590
I'm just gonna wait until I have enough for this.

9773
05:47:29,290 --> 05:47:30,010
I asked that.

9774
05:47:30,050 --> 05:47:30,650
I know, right?

9775
05:47:30,670 --> 05:47:31,690
What's the point of thinking?

9776
05:47:31,870 --> 05:47:32,890
I'm just here to...

9777
05:47:32,890 --> 05:47:33,570
Bunga Bunga.

9778
05:47:35,570 --> 05:47:37,150
Oh my god.

9779
05:47:37,610 --> 05:47:38,910
No, everything will be okay.

9780
05:47:39,370 --> 05:47:39,570
Everything...

9781
05:47:40,970 --> 05:47:41,530
Oh...

9782
05:47:42,430 --> 05:47:43,190
Oh, okay.

9783
05:47:43,270 --> 05:47:44,170
Everything will be okay.

9784
05:47:45,990 --> 05:47:46,550
Yay!

9785
05:47:47,630 --> 05:47:48,710
I knew it.

9786
05:47:48,890 --> 05:47:50,570
I knew everything will be okay.

9787
05:47:51,810 --> 05:47:53,330
I knew it.

9788
05:47:54,830 --> 05:47:55,690
Alright.

9789
05:47:55,690 --> 05:47:56,430
It's time.

9790
05:47:56,670 --> 05:47:57,270
No more lag.

9791
05:48:00,910 --> 05:48:01,770
Alright.

9792
05:48:03,890 --> 05:48:05,050
It's time.

9793
05:48:08,320 --> 05:48:09,610
Now we can...

9794
05:48:09,610 --> 05:48:12,110
We either Doom Q or...

9795
05:48:12,110 --> 05:48:13,770
We feel something today.

9796
05:48:14,590 --> 05:48:15,250
Okay.

9797
05:48:18,630 --> 05:48:20,470
It's one or the other.

9798
05:48:25,530 --> 05:48:27,310
Did you win or lose?

9799
05:48:31,050 --> 05:48:34,270
I like how none of us know if like they won or lost.

9800
05:48:34,570 --> 05:48:35,830
None of us like...

9801
05:48:35,830 --> 05:48:36,870
Figured it out.

9802
05:48:37,090 --> 05:48:38,390
Because none of us watched it.

9803
05:48:56,040 --> 05:48:56,960
Wait, where it went?

9804
05:48:58,240 --> 05:48:59,180
Oh, they won!

9805
05:48:59,440 --> 05:49:00,300
That was a long talk.

9806
05:49:01,320 --> 05:49:02,020
They won...

9807
05:49:02,020 --> 05:49:03,880
They won even though it was a long talk.

9808
05:49:06,360 --> 05:49:06,980
Oh.

9809
05:49:07,400 --> 05:49:08,200
Queue up.

9810
05:49:11,240 --> 05:49:12,900
We burn his house down.

9811
05:49:13,200 --> 05:49:14,060
I don't care.

9812
05:49:25,810 --> 05:49:26,950
Fucking coward.

9813
05:49:27,110 --> 05:49:27,850
Queue up!

9814
05:49:37,460 --> 05:49:38,080
Okay.

9815
05:49:38,240 --> 05:49:38,820
No, he's not...

9816
05:49:38,820 --> 05:49:40,000
Okay, not a coward anymore.

9817
05:49:40,280 --> 05:49:40,720
It's okay.

9818
05:49:41,100 --> 05:49:41,720
It's...

9819
05:49:43,800 --> 05:49:44,500
All right.

9820
05:49:44,800 --> 05:49:45,460
We out of here.

9821
05:49:46,460 --> 05:49:49,080
This is either gonna be Doom or not Doom.

9822
05:49:49,820 --> 05:49:51,340
It's time to find out.

9823
05:49:53,360 --> 05:49:54,720
Are we Dooming tonight?

9824
05:49:59,910 --> 05:50:01,150
Let's find out.

9825
05:50:04,180 --> 05:50:05,400
I should make my...

9826
05:50:05,400 --> 05:50:05,820
I'm gonna play...

9827
05:50:05,820 --> 05:50:07,900
Maybe I'll play until my Goodnight Dragoons.

9828
05:50:08,760 --> 05:50:09,200
All right.

9829
05:50:09,240 --> 05:50:10,480
Oh, I should make my waiting room, guys.

9830
05:50:10,480 --> 05:50:11,640
What if I...

9831
05:50:11,640 --> 05:50:11,800
What if like...

9832
05:50:11,800 --> 05:50:12,680
Okay, guys.

9833
05:50:12,900 --> 05:50:15,720
What if I merge Goodnight Dragoons with this stream?

9834
05:50:17,600 --> 05:50:18,240
Like...

9835
05:50:18,240 --> 05:50:19,940
What if...

9836
05:50:19,940 --> 05:50:20,740
What if...

9837
05:50:20,740 --> 05:50:21,880
Like...

9838
05:50:21,880 --> 05:50:22,680
Just be like...

9839
05:50:22,680 --> 05:50:23,140
Time stamp.

9840
05:50:23,380 --> 05:50:25,360
This is where Goodnight Dragoons start.

9841
05:50:34,920 --> 05:50:36,440
Just like that.

9842
05:50:36,560 --> 05:50:37,460
This is where...

9843
05:50:37,460 --> 05:50:38,920
I don't know if I want to make another wave.

9844
05:50:39,340 --> 05:50:40,200
This is where...

9845
05:50:40,200 --> 05:50:41,020
Just time stamp.

9846
05:50:41,240 --> 05:50:43,480
This is where Goodnight Dragoons start.

9847
05:50:44,040 --> 05:50:44,500
This is...

9848
05:50:51,810 --> 05:50:55,850
That would be pretty on the channel.

9849
05:50:56,130 --> 05:50:58,050
But it's the same thing!

9850
05:50:58,810 --> 05:50:59,730
It's...

9851
05:51:02,910 --> 05:51:04,950
It's the same thing!

9852
05:51:05,670 --> 05:51:07,010
What do you mean?

9853
05:51:12,050 --> 05:51:13,610
You don't know that.

9854
05:51:14,150 --> 05:51:15,630
You don't know that, guys.

9855
05:51:23,680 --> 05:51:25,200
Everything will be okay.

9856
05:51:29,000 --> 05:51:32,500
Oh my god, by the time, like, we get a game, like, he can pick up his food.

9857
05:51:35,860 --> 05:51:36,940
Oh wait, never mind.

9858
05:51:37,240 --> 05:51:38,020
We got a game.

9859
05:51:47,090 --> 05:51:47,810
All right.

9860
05:51:50,610 --> 05:51:52,590
Maybe I can actually play Luna now.

9861
05:51:53,670 --> 05:51:55,270
Maybe I can actually...

9862
05:51:55,270 --> 05:51:55,990
I smoked, bro.

9863
05:51:56,630 --> 05:51:57,030
Goodnight...

9864
05:51:57,030 --> 05:51:58,210
How is that a nightmare?

9865
05:51:58,710 --> 05:51:59,110
It's...

9866
05:52:00,630 --> 05:52:01,630
I'm gonna get water.

9867
05:52:01,730 --> 05:52:02,190
I'll be right back.

9868
05:52:02,970 --> 05:52:03,830
I'm gonna get water.

9869
05:52:05,630 --> 05:52:07,290
Maybe if you turn open mic off.

9870
05:52:11,070 --> 05:52:11,790
Thank you, bro.

9871
05:52:13,230 --> 05:52:14,070
I'll win for you now.

9872
05:52:46,380 --> 05:52:47,040
All right.

9873
05:52:47,560 --> 05:52:49,320
Oh my god, I can actually play Luna.

9874
05:52:49,660 --> 05:52:51,320
I haven't played Luna at all...

9875
05:52:51,320 --> 05:52:52,920
The entire time.

9876
05:52:59,920 --> 05:53:01,000
Pick your hero.

9877
05:53:01,340 --> 05:53:02,080
Or villain.

9878
05:53:02,260 --> 05:53:03,020
I'm not judging.

9879
05:53:03,860 --> 05:53:04,280
All right.

9880
05:53:04,860 --> 05:53:05,100
Yay!

9881
05:53:05,880 --> 05:53:06,400
Luna!

9882
05:53:12,650 --> 05:53:13,170
Yippee!

9883
05:53:18,450 --> 05:53:19,410
Oh, did they?

9884
05:53:19,990 --> 05:53:21,230
I'm not surprised.

9885
05:53:22,150 --> 05:53:22,310
All right.

9886
05:53:22,510 --> 05:53:23,830
Let me unpin the message.

9887
05:53:24,550 --> 05:53:26,330
They banned my Loki, man.

9888
05:53:26,570 --> 05:53:27,250
Just over.

9889
05:53:29,050 --> 05:53:29,390
Who?

9890
05:53:34,340 --> 05:53:35,100
All right.

9891
05:53:36,900 --> 05:53:37,520
All right.

9892
05:53:37,620 --> 05:53:39,660
Let's see if Gomez's house burns down.

9893
05:53:41,460 --> 05:53:42,160
Can I get back?

9894
05:53:52,900 --> 05:53:54,420
I prefer strategist.

9895
05:53:54,480 --> 05:53:55,780
This girl right here.

9896
05:53:56,020 --> 05:53:58,860
And I didn't get to play her during tournament because we kept batting her.

9897
05:54:02,480 --> 05:54:03,580
She's just too good.

9898
05:54:10,940 --> 05:54:13,520
I can play any support, but I like playing Luna.

9899
05:54:13,940 --> 05:54:15,540
For me, she's the most fun.

9900
05:54:16,280 --> 05:54:18,020
I just find her the most fun.

9901
05:54:27,890 --> 05:54:29,770
God, I haven't played her in so long.

9902
05:54:30,190 --> 05:54:31,470
Fuck, I've suppressed...

9903
05:54:31,470 --> 05:54:34,310
I'm not used to keeping my space.

9904
05:54:34,530 --> 05:54:35,670
I like to jump too much.

9905
05:54:36,810 --> 05:54:37,690
She's not good.

9906
05:54:39,490 --> 05:54:41,090
I need to remember how to aim on Luna.

9907
05:54:42,130 --> 05:54:46,650
Every support has, like, a different aim style, so, like, it's...

9908
05:54:47,490 --> 05:54:48,950
It really affects me.

9909
05:54:49,530 --> 05:54:50,010
1, 1, 1, 1.

9910
05:54:50,790 --> 05:54:53,110
1, 1, 1, 1.

9911
05:55:00,870 --> 05:55:01,150
1, 1, 1, 1.

9912
05:55:01,150 --> 05:55:01,590
I'm going to try this.

9913
05:55:02,990 --> 05:55:03,850
Don't have, don't have.

9914
05:55:05,010 --> 05:55:05,950
Oh, my God.

9915
05:55:08,450 --> 05:55:09,970
1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

9916
05:55:10,310 --> 05:55:10,730
Please!

9917
05:55:11,150 --> 05:55:12,110
They're so low!

9918
05:55:12,570 --> 05:55:12,930
Nice.

9919
05:55:14,590 --> 05:55:15,470
Okay, don't feel us.

9920
05:55:16,850 --> 05:55:17,470
All right.

9921
05:55:19,550 --> 05:55:22,730
Like, every support has a different aiming style.

9922
05:55:23,010 --> 05:55:26,050
So, because I didn't get a chance to play Luna at all.

9923
05:55:27,890 --> 05:55:30,330
Yeah, I didn't get a chance to play Luna at all the whole day.

9924
05:55:30,710 --> 05:55:33,830
I have to remember how to fuck to play Luna.

9925
05:55:39,750 --> 05:55:43,170
Oh, we did really good in Round Robin, but it was single elimination.

9926
05:55:43,750 --> 05:55:47,570
So, like, we got knocked out right off the bat, which is unlucky.

9927
05:55:48,050 --> 05:55:51,570
We just fucked up Bandline, and, like, um...

9928
05:55:54,570 --> 05:55:55,850
Well, fucked up Bandline?

9929
05:55:55,930 --> 05:55:57,830
Yeah, I think it's just a Bandline thing.

9930
05:55:57,970 --> 05:55:59,290
And we didn't counterswap in 10.

9931
05:56:02,910 --> 05:56:04,570
But, like, you know...

9932
05:56:06,910 --> 05:56:07,690
The stack up?

9933
05:56:08,190 --> 05:56:09,030
Oh, never mind.

9934
05:56:10,970 --> 05:56:13,470
It's the cowboy, it's the cowboy, it's the cowboy.

9935
05:56:13,930 --> 05:56:14,330
Hello!

9936
05:56:16,810 --> 05:56:17,210
Hello!

9937
05:56:19,250 --> 05:56:19,650
Dance!

9938
05:56:21,870 --> 05:56:22,710
Where are you?

9939
05:56:22,870 --> 05:56:23,710
I see you!

9940
05:56:24,170 --> 05:56:25,370
You think you can hide?

9941
05:56:31,450 --> 05:56:34,710
I mean, I think, even though we got knocked out right off the bat...

9942
05:56:35,210 --> 05:56:35,610
Um...

9943
05:56:36,390 --> 05:56:38,290
I had a great time meeting everybody.

9944
05:56:38,450 --> 05:56:41,190
I mean, I got a Tyler1 collab, that's crazy, you know?

9945
05:56:41,870 --> 05:56:43,630
I gotta play with Tyler1.

9946
05:56:43,690 --> 05:56:46,670
I don't think I'll ever have, like, that type of chance again in the future.

9947
05:56:47,270 --> 05:56:49,270
But, like, I'm thankful for it.

9948
05:56:50,250 --> 05:56:50,990
I'm hurt.

9949
05:56:51,570 --> 05:56:53,470
Like, it just happens.

9950
05:56:54,330 --> 05:56:55,770
Please tell me you have a shield.

9951
05:56:56,050 --> 05:56:56,570
Please.

9952
05:56:56,950 --> 05:56:57,590
Oh, thank God.

9953
05:56:58,430 --> 05:57:00,490
That was, like, the most I've ever...

9954
05:57:00,870 --> 05:57:02,870
I had to believe so hard.

9955
05:57:04,990 --> 05:57:05,510
Oh...

9956
05:57:05,510 --> 05:57:07,110
Oh, I didn't.

9957
05:57:08,210 --> 05:57:09,430
Yeah, it's still really fun.

9958
05:57:09,750 --> 05:57:10,450
We're good, we're good, we're good.

9959
05:57:11,370 --> 05:57:16,750
Yeah, so, like, I'm just happy to have a chance to be able to...

9960
05:57:17,690 --> 05:57:18,150
Uh...

9961
05:57:18,700 --> 05:57:20,190
To be able to get that opportunity.

9962
05:57:24,710 --> 05:57:27,410
It's just unfortunate, because we have...

9963
05:57:29,670 --> 05:57:30,130
Uh...

9964
05:57:30,130 --> 05:57:31,430
He's got lasagna.

9965
05:57:32,050 --> 05:57:33,310
Maybe I can do both.

9966
05:57:35,130 --> 05:57:36,400
I ate... I ate the...

9967
05:57:36,830 --> 05:57:38,790
The new chicken strips from McDonald's today.

9968
05:57:39,270 --> 05:57:39,970
It's pretty good.

9969
05:57:40,970 --> 05:57:41,650
Nice, bro.

9970
05:57:42,790 --> 05:57:47,130
Yeah, I also, like, used a deal where I got, like, a free medium prize with it.

9971
05:57:47,490 --> 05:57:48,290
It's pretty good.

9972
05:57:50,070 --> 05:57:52,090
Hey, I'm MVP, guys.

9973
05:57:52,750 --> 05:57:54,330
See, this is my best character.

9974
05:57:54,750 --> 05:57:55,050
He added it.

9975
05:57:55,110 --> 05:57:55,770
It's, like, insane.

9976
05:57:56,510 --> 05:57:57,170
It's, like, so good.

9977
05:57:58,110 --> 05:57:58,770
It's insane.

9978
05:57:59,530 --> 05:58:01,590
It's, like, it's...

9979
05:58:01,590 --> 05:58:01,850
Yeah, yeah.

9980
05:58:02,530 --> 05:58:07,270
Dude, you know how, like, McDonald's, like, their chicken nuggets are, like, just, like, an actual chicken?

9981
05:58:07,610 --> 05:58:09,090
Like, the chicken strips taste like chicken.

9982
05:58:09,530 --> 05:58:10,190
Like, it's really good.

9983
05:58:10,930 --> 05:58:13,330
I'm happy with how I done it, individual-wise.

9984
05:58:13,690 --> 05:58:14,170
In that tournament.

9985
05:58:14,590 --> 05:58:15,650
I think I performed really well.

9986
05:58:16,190 --> 05:58:18,030
I should have commed things better.

9987
05:58:18,350 --> 05:58:20,630
Like, for our other two supports who...

9988
05:58:20,630 --> 05:58:22,970
I could have, like, micromanaged them better.

9989
05:58:24,210 --> 05:58:25,090
Because, um...

9990
05:58:25,090 --> 05:58:27,690
I played as, like, you know, when I say...

9991
05:58:27,690 --> 05:58:30,570
Uh, when I say things, like, they're strange as ult.

9992
05:58:31,390 --> 05:58:35,870
Normally, like, the other supports, you know, with that knowledge, we wouldn't group up with each other.

9993
05:58:36,290 --> 05:58:37,210
But, like...

9994
05:58:37,210 --> 05:58:38,910
I went in with that.

9995
05:58:39,190 --> 05:58:40,950
But, like, I should have commed and be, like, split up.

9996
05:58:41,090 --> 05:58:42,430
Like, someone take high ground and stuff.

9997
05:58:42,830 --> 05:58:43,990
Obviously, like...

9998
05:58:46,410 --> 05:58:49,130
It's, like...

9999
05:58:49,130 --> 05:58:51,030
I mean, that was, like, a big issue with our high...

10000
05:58:51,030 --> 05:58:52,890
Like, me, Gale, and...

10001
05:58:55,770 --> 05:58:58,950
Oh, me, Gale, and, uh...

10002
05:58:58,950 --> 05:59:04,770
Super, we were comming as if we were playing with a team that was all high ranks.

10003
05:59:05,110 --> 05:59:12,030
And because we were playing like that, our weaker teammates, who might not play rivals a lot, were very confused with our comms.

10004
05:59:12,190 --> 05:59:15,110
So, like, that was, like, our problem for that.

10005
05:59:18,010 --> 05:59:18,470
Yeah.

10006
05:59:18,470 --> 05:59:18,570
Yeah.

10007
05:59:23,180 --> 05:59:24,160
So, I could have...

10008
05:59:24,160 --> 05:59:25,540
Obviously, I could have done that better.

10009
05:59:25,780 --> 05:59:26,480
For my team.

10010
05:59:32,000 --> 05:59:32,460
Oh,

10011
05:59:39,880 --> 05:59:40,380
I should...

10012
05:59:40,380 --> 05:59:41,060
Do that.

10013
05:59:42,240 --> 05:59:44,420
Yeah, like, Tyler1 was really lost, too.

10014
05:59:44,520 --> 05:59:45,380
But that's fine, man.

10015
05:59:45,380 --> 05:59:45,840
It was great.

10016
05:59:49,060 --> 05:59:49,900
Alright, it's fine.

10017
05:59:50,040 --> 05:59:51,140
I had to use it, in the end.

10018
05:59:52,240 --> 05:59:53,800
I tried to wait for the last moment.

10019
05:59:55,200 --> 05:59:55,640
Yippee!

10020
05:59:56,900 --> 05:59:57,340
Yippee!

10021
05:59:58,300 --> 05:59:58,740
Yippee!

10022
05:59:59,260 --> 05:59:59,700
Dance!

10023
06:00:00,800 --> 06:00:02,820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10024
06:00:03,600 --> 06:00:05,540
Yeah, I'm happy to play with Tyler1.

10025
06:00:06,260 --> 06:00:07,280
And, like, you know.

10026
06:00:08,180 --> 06:00:09,880
Some of them were playing for the first time.

10027
06:00:10,340 --> 06:00:11,040
It's just important...

10028
06:00:11,040 --> 06:00:12,800
We just got target banded really hard.

10029
06:00:13,880 --> 06:00:14,320
Like...

10030
06:00:14,320 --> 06:00:18,100
We got two players that have very limited hero-hero pools.

10031
06:00:34,820 --> 06:00:36,980
I should freeze them.

10032
06:00:39,740 --> 06:00:41,080
Now I'm dead.

10033
06:00:42,620 --> 06:00:46,180
Why does every time they stay stacked...

10034
06:00:46,180 --> 06:00:48,080
They don't stack!

10035
06:00:54,060 --> 06:00:54,980
They lie!

10036
06:00:59,000 --> 06:01:01,680
They say stack, but they don't stack!

10037
06:01:01,720 --> 06:01:03,920
I swear, the guy!

10038
06:01:09,880 --> 06:01:11,960
I know I shouldn't.

10039
06:01:11,960 --> 06:01:12,840
Superchat because I...

10040
06:01:12,840 --> 06:01:16,540
Thank you, thank you, but please take care of yourself.

10041
06:01:16,760 --> 06:01:17,820
I really appreciate it.

10042
06:01:21,940 --> 06:01:25,600
All they do, all rival players do is lie!

10043
06:01:25,600 --> 06:01:25,740
Why?

10044
06:01:28,760 --> 06:01:30,300
That's all they do!

10045
06:01:33,300 --> 06:01:35,180
They said stack!

10046
06:01:39,680 --> 06:01:41,080
Aw, she took that.

10047
06:01:41,220 --> 06:01:42,540
I was trying to freeze somebody else.

10048
06:01:43,980 --> 06:01:45,720
All they do is lie!

10049
06:01:49,240 --> 06:01:52,400
All they do is lie!

10050
06:01:52,420 --> 06:01:57,280
I don't know where a lot of my teammates are.

10051
06:02:04,760 --> 06:02:05,580
There we go.

10052
06:02:05,640 --> 06:02:06,740
There we go.

10053
06:02:07,520 --> 06:02:08,440
Yay, MVP!

10054
06:02:09,580 --> 06:02:11,140
I play Luna, I win!

10055
06:02:16,900 --> 06:02:18,020
Thank you guys for the win.

10056
06:02:18,140 --> 06:02:18,540
Thank you, bro.

10057
06:02:21,580 --> 06:02:22,320
Let's go.

10058
06:02:26,450 --> 06:02:27,230
Let's go.

10059
06:02:27,290 --> 06:02:27,610
Let's fucking go.

10060
06:02:27,870 --> 06:02:28,290
That's me.

10061
06:02:28,550 --> 06:02:29,930
Dance, you...

10062
06:02:29,930 --> 06:02:31,170
I can't say it.

10063
06:02:31,770 --> 06:02:34,210
Dance, you beautiful person.

10064
06:02:35,010 --> 06:02:36,010
You know what I can say?

10065
06:02:36,090 --> 06:02:36,670
I'm playing here.

10066
06:02:36,830 --> 06:02:37,830
Dance, you whore.

10067
06:02:38,190 --> 06:02:39,070
That's right.

10068
06:02:43,310 --> 06:02:45,150
Dance for me!

10069
06:02:48,770 --> 06:02:50,050
I need this!

10070
06:02:54,370 --> 06:02:55,250
Whoa!

10071
06:02:56,490 --> 06:02:57,710
Whoa, Doki!

10072
06:02:58,330 --> 06:03:01,050
It's okay, I can say it because I'm playing here right now.

10073
06:03:02,710 --> 06:03:04,530
It's not derogatory!

10074
06:03:04,530 --> 06:03:06,230
I'm literally playing here!

10075
06:03:06,730 --> 06:03:08,890
How can it be derogatory?

10076
06:03:18,290 --> 06:03:18,730
What?

10077
06:03:19,030 --> 06:03:20,090
Why is he... oh.

10078
06:03:27,390 --> 06:03:27,830
Alright.

10079
06:03:29,310 --> 06:03:31,710
No, cause like, I'm playing her but I'm not her.

10080
06:03:33,550 --> 06:03:35,690
So it's not directed at me.

10081
06:03:36,150 --> 06:03:38,070
It's like, you know how like, you know...

10082
06:03:38,070 --> 06:03:39,990
Okay, it's like a... a girl's thing.

10083
06:03:40,210 --> 06:03:45,090
You know, like, sometimes you compliment another woman and be like, that's right whore.

10084
06:03:45,370 --> 06:03:47,490
Like, but like, not derogatory.

10085
06:03:48,590 --> 06:03:50,390
I don't have a lot of female friends.

10086
06:03:56,430 --> 06:03:56,910
No!

10087
06:03:57,250 --> 06:03:57,730
No!

10088
06:03:58,710 --> 06:04:03,390
It's sort of obvious I don't have a lot of female friends.

10089
06:04:04,590 --> 06:04:05,550
It's okay.

10090
06:04:08,050 --> 06:04:09,510
I can see why...

10091
06:04:11,650 --> 06:04:15,590
I'm just saying like, you know, okay, so like, you know, you're like, yeah, that's right slut.

10092
06:04:15,590 --> 06:04:18,970
Like, you know, like, but like, like, as a compliment.

10093
06:04:21,450 --> 06:04:25,530
Maybe not call them whores for starters.

10094
06:04:26,170 --> 06:04:28,370
I have female friends!

10095
06:04:28,770 --> 06:04:29,870
Just not a lot.

10096
06:04:30,050 --> 06:04:31,550
Just not a lot.

10097
06:04:34,970 --> 06:04:35,930
I'll just...

10098
06:04:37,430 --> 06:04:38,630
Okay, okay.

10099
06:04:39,030 --> 06:04:40,130
There's a reason why.

10100
06:04:41,030 --> 06:04:42,410
There's a reason why.

10101
06:04:42,850 --> 06:04:43,770
Cause like...

10102
06:04:43,770 --> 06:04:44,510
Okay, I'll tell...

10103
06:04:44,510 --> 06:04:45,710
Okay, this is like...

10104
06:04:45,710 --> 06:04:46,310
This is like...

10105
06:04:46,310 --> 06:04:46,690
I don't know.

10106
06:04:46,910 --> 06:04:47,410
I don't know.

10107
06:04:47,610 --> 06:04:48,050
Okay.

10108
06:04:48,570 --> 06:04:49,690
It's sort of like...

10109
06:04:49,690 --> 06:04:51,430
I don't know if it's a hot tick.

10110
06:04:51,430 --> 06:04:51,810
It...

10111
06:04:51,810 --> 06:04:52,330
Okay.

10112
06:04:52,510 --> 06:04:54,430
From personal experience...

10113
06:04:57,270 --> 06:04:57,790
From...

10114
06:04:58,170 --> 06:04:59,710
From personal experience...

10115
06:05:00,690 --> 06:05:03,890
Male friends are easier to handle.

10116
06:05:09,150 --> 06:05:10,630
There's less drama.

10117
06:05:11,730 --> 06:05:12,290
There's...

10118
06:05:12,290 --> 06:05:13,450
There's less...

10119
06:05:13,450 --> 06:05:15,310
Less drama involved.

10120
06:05:15,730 --> 06:05:16,090
And less...

10121
06:05:17,670 --> 06:05:19,290
Less gossiping and stuff.

10122
06:05:19,630 --> 06:05:21,150
So that's why I...

10123
06:05:21,150 --> 06:05:21,870
Like...

10124
06:05:21,870 --> 06:05:23,530
I have more male friends.

10125
06:05:24,250 --> 06:05:26,770
So he really is an honorable bro.

10126
06:05:27,150 --> 06:05:27,950
Solid snake.

10127
06:05:28,110 --> 06:05:29,150
Thank you for the super chat.

10128
06:05:29,330 --> 06:05:29,750
Thank you.

10129
06:05:29,910 --> 06:05:30,370
Thank you.

10130
06:05:30,650 --> 06:05:32,150
Like, I just wanna vibe.

10131
06:05:32,150 --> 06:05:33,310
I just wanna...

10132
06:05:33,310 --> 06:05:35,310
I don't wanna deal with...

10133
06:05:35,310 --> 06:05:36,290
Like...

10134
06:05:36,290 --> 06:05:36,310
Drama.

10135
06:05:36,670 --> 06:05:38,350
I don't wanna deal with like...

10136
06:05:38,350 --> 06:05:39,990
People like...

10137
06:05:39,990 --> 06:05:42,030
Saying one thing and doing another thing.

10138
06:05:47,300 --> 06:05:47,900
Okay.

10139
06:05:48,240 --> 06:05:48,900
What is...

10140
06:05:49,180 --> 06:05:49,480
Okay.

10141
06:05:49,800 --> 06:05:51,300
This has to be a four stack.

10142
06:05:52,980 --> 06:05:54,620
Whoever's on the enemy team?

10143
06:05:55,320 --> 06:05:55,920
Like...

10144
06:05:55,920 --> 06:05:56,660
What the fuck?

10145
06:05:57,740 --> 06:05:58,340
Mercenary!

10146
06:05:59,560 --> 06:06:00,300
Thank you.

10147
06:06:00,440 --> 06:06:01,540
Welcome to tomato fight.

10148
06:06:01,680 --> 06:06:01,980
Welcome.

10149
06:06:02,140 --> 06:06:02,360
Welcome.

10150
06:06:02,880 --> 06:06:04,480
No, it's not like...

10151
06:06:04,480 --> 06:06:05,540
Someone will be like...

10152
06:06:05,540 --> 06:06:07,680
Oh, that's such a pick me girl thing.

10153
06:06:07,860 --> 06:06:08,660
But it's like...

10154
06:06:08,660 --> 06:06:09,680
I've had...

10155
06:06:11,220 --> 06:06:13,160
A lot of like...

10156
06:06:13,160 --> 06:06:14,480
Bad experiences...

10157
06:06:15,100 --> 06:06:15,680
With like...

10158
06:06:16,080 --> 06:06:16,840
Groups of women.

10159
06:06:19,260 --> 06:06:20,700
Where like...

10160
06:06:20,700 --> 06:06:22,520
It's more so of like...

10161
06:06:22,520 --> 06:06:23,360
It's like...

10162
06:06:23,360 --> 06:06:24,220
Everyone...

10163
06:06:24,220 --> 06:06:24,960
They would just like...

10164
06:06:24,960 --> 06:06:25,940
Talk bad...

10165
06:06:25,940 --> 06:06:27,180
Bad about each other.

10166
06:06:27,540 --> 06:06:28,220
But like...

10167
06:06:28,220 --> 06:06:29,580
Obviously they'll...

10168
06:06:29,580 --> 06:06:29,960
Like...

10169
06:06:29,960 --> 06:06:32,140
It's just my own personal experience.

10170
06:06:32,900 --> 06:06:33,460
And...

10171
06:06:33,460 --> 06:06:34,140
It's like...

10172
06:06:34,140 --> 06:06:35,620
They'll talk bad about each other.

10173
06:06:35,860 --> 06:06:36,960
But then they'll like...

10174
06:06:37,680 --> 06:06:38,240
Um...

10175
06:06:38,240 --> 06:06:38,860
They'll like...

10176
06:06:38,860 --> 06:06:39,900
Pretend they're like...

10177
06:06:39,900 --> 06:06:40,700
Nice about it.

10178
06:06:40,760 --> 06:06:41,400
And I just...

10179
06:06:41,400 --> 06:06:42,080
I just...

10180
06:06:42,080 --> 06:06:43,000
Can't take that.

10181
06:06:43,180 --> 06:06:44,360
It's just too much work.

10182
06:06:44,700 --> 06:06:45,160
It's...

10183
06:06:46,920 --> 06:06:47,440
Like...

10184
06:06:47,440 --> 06:06:47,600
Like...

10185
06:06:47,600 --> 06:06:48,080
Behind their backs.

10186
06:06:48,320 --> 06:06:48,900
Stuff like that.

10187
06:06:49,360 --> 06:06:49,880
And...

10188
06:06:49,880 --> 06:06:50,560
Yeah...

10189
06:06:50,560 --> 06:06:52,460
I just don't like the two-faced shit.

10190
06:06:52,620 --> 06:06:53,120
It's just...

10191
06:06:53,120 --> 06:06:54,020
And then like...

10192
06:06:54,020 --> 06:06:55,260
Male friends...

10193
06:06:55,260 --> 06:06:56,500
It does happen.

10194
06:06:56,780 --> 06:06:57,480
But like...

10195
06:06:57,480 --> 06:06:59,220
From my own personal experience...

10196
06:06:59,220 --> 06:07:00,360
It happens...

10197
06:07:00,360 --> 06:07:00,660
Less.

10198
06:07:00,920 --> 06:07:02,160
Cause they'll be like...

10199
06:07:02,160 --> 06:07:04,340
Passive aggressive to your fucking face.

10200
06:07:04,420 --> 06:07:04,680
Yeah.

10201
06:07:04,940 --> 06:07:05,920
But like...

10202
06:07:05,920 --> 06:07:06,520
Um...

10203
06:07:06,520 --> 06:07:08,360
I just don't like the two-facedness...

10204
06:07:08,360 --> 06:07:08,800
And stuff.

10205
06:07:08,980 --> 06:07:09,940
So I've had...

10206
06:07:09,940 --> 06:07:12,180
A lot worse experience with that...

10207
06:07:12,180 --> 06:07:12,880
Growing up.

10208
06:07:13,540 --> 06:07:14,920
Like when I have like...

10209
06:07:14,920 --> 06:07:16,320
When I hang out with groups of women.

10210
06:07:16,960 --> 06:07:18,060
And so like...

10211
06:07:18,060 --> 06:07:18,600
I have like...

10212
06:07:18,600 --> 06:07:20,060
Individual female friends.

10213
06:07:20,460 --> 06:07:21,700
But like...

10214
06:07:21,700 --> 06:07:23,240
Less so of like...

10215
06:07:23,240 --> 06:07:23,920
A group thing.

10216
06:07:25,440 --> 06:07:25,940
Yeah.

10217
06:07:26,160 --> 06:07:27,720
There's just too much mind games involved.

10218
06:07:27,920 --> 06:07:28,480
And like...

10219
06:07:29,040 --> 06:07:29,540
I'm...

10220
06:07:30,100 --> 06:07:32,480
I'd rather just vibe and play video games.

10221
06:07:47,250 --> 06:07:48,850
So that's why I have...

10222
06:07:48,850 --> 06:07:49,750
I have...

10223
06:07:49,750 --> 06:07:51,290
I don't have a lot of female friends.

10224
06:07:51,290 --> 06:07:51,630
Cause...

10225
06:07:51,630 --> 06:07:53,850
I have individual female friends.

10226
06:07:54,310 --> 06:07:54,970
But...

10227
06:07:54,970 --> 06:07:56,930
Very rarely will I have like...

10228
06:07:56,930 --> 06:07:58,610
A female group of friends.

10229
06:07:59,030 --> 06:07:59,670
Which is...

10230
06:07:59,670 --> 06:08:01,490
I like the Snoppy sisters though.

10231
06:08:01,650 --> 06:08:02,770
Everybody's really nice there.

10232
06:08:04,290 --> 06:08:04,950
Um...

10233
06:08:04,950 --> 06:08:05,690
And...

10234
06:08:05,690 --> 06:08:06,590
It was like...

10235
06:08:06,590 --> 06:08:07,510
More so of like...

10236
06:08:07,510 --> 06:08:08,550
Oh wait.

10237
06:08:08,650 --> 06:08:09,210
Let me...

10238
06:08:09,210 --> 06:08:09,430
Okay.

10239
06:08:09,510 --> 06:08:09,850
Wolverine.

10240
06:08:11,950 --> 06:08:12,610
Um...

10241
06:08:12,610 --> 06:08:13,170
But it was like...

10242
06:08:13,170 --> 06:08:13,970
I met each...

10243
06:08:13,970 --> 06:08:14,440
I like...

10244
06:08:15,210 --> 06:08:15,670
Direct...

10245
06:08:15,670 --> 06:08:16,770
Contacted them directly.

10246
06:08:17,250 --> 06:08:17,670
Like...

10247
06:08:17,670 --> 06:08:18,370
Individually.

10248
06:08:19,450 --> 06:08:20,190
And stuff.

10249
06:08:20,390 --> 06:08:21,150
To make that group.

10250
06:08:21,570 --> 06:08:22,370
And stuff.

10251
06:08:22,370 --> 06:08:22,530
To make that group.

10252
06:08:23,010 --> 06:08:23,990
Cause it was like...

10253
06:08:23,990 --> 06:08:24,910
An individual thing.

10254
06:08:25,090 --> 06:08:25,870
And it was like...

10255
06:08:25,870 --> 06:08:26,690
I remember like...

10256
06:08:26,690 --> 06:08:28,290
I contacted each of them individually.

10257
06:08:28,290 --> 06:08:30,010
To make a collab group of it.

10258
06:08:30,990 --> 06:08:31,430
Venom?

10259
06:08:33,310 --> 06:08:34,370
Hey on Spikey?

10260
06:08:34,690 --> 06:08:34,850
Hello.

10261
06:08:35,570 --> 06:08:36,050
A little guy.

10262
06:08:37,250 --> 06:08:37,770
Scared.

10263
06:08:39,830 --> 06:08:40,350
Whoa.

10264
06:08:40,710 --> 06:08:40,870
Maybe.

10265
06:08:42,850 --> 06:08:43,950
Nah, I just played him.

10266
06:08:46,450 --> 06:08:46,890
Yeah.

10267
06:08:46,890 --> 06:08:47,090
I don't know.

10268
06:08:47,390 --> 06:08:47,990
I'm sorry.

10269
06:08:47,990 --> 06:08:48,050
I don't know.

10270
06:08:48,050 --> 06:08:49,310
You got a fucking bite.

10271
06:08:49,870 --> 06:08:51,090
Guess I'll stay down here.

10272
06:08:51,110 --> 06:08:51,550
How about your eye?

10273
06:08:51,550 --> 06:08:52,150
Metal, by the way.

10274
06:08:53,270 --> 06:08:54,870
I hear so much...

10275
06:08:54,870 --> 06:08:55,450
Oh there it is.

10276
06:08:55,570 --> 06:08:55,870
I'm good, I'm good.

10277
06:08:56,110 --> 06:08:56,630
There you go.

10278
06:08:56,830 --> 06:08:58,330
I was like, I hear the sound.

10279
06:08:58,450 --> 06:08:59,070
I'll get you next time.

10280
06:09:05,960 --> 06:09:06,340
I'm on one.

10281
06:09:06,340 --> 06:09:06,860
I'm on one.

10282
06:09:08,280 --> 06:09:11,020
Okay, time to focus up...

10283
06:09:14,090 --> 06:09:15,250
Oh, I don't have...

10284
06:09:15,570 --> 06:09:16,550
I don't have another ice.

10285
06:09:17,450 --> 06:09:18,330
We're running major.

10286
06:09:21,650 --> 06:09:23,470
Okay, we're down like three here, Thomas.

10287
06:09:24,610 --> 06:09:25,490
I'm back in the fight.

10288
06:09:25,530 --> 06:09:25,730
Whoa!

10289
06:09:30,820 --> 06:09:33,440
But that's just more like my personal experience.

10290
06:09:34,040 --> 06:09:34,780
In general.

10291
06:09:35,640 --> 06:09:36,840
I have no idea at all.

10292
06:09:37,040 --> 06:09:38,180
I was like, oh, it's serious.

10293
06:09:38,460 --> 06:09:39,580
Why did we switch off cloak, bruh?

10294
06:09:39,680 --> 06:09:40,520
Did you not have ult?

10295
06:09:42,000 --> 06:09:43,400
Bruh, that ult sucks, bruh.

10296
06:09:45,780 --> 06:09:47,180
Nercon doesn't counter it, though.

10297
06:09:48,440 --> 06:09:49,040
Oh, no.

10298
06:09:51,220 --> 06:09:52,200
Oh, no.

10299
06:09:52,580 --> 06:09:53,620
Oh, no.

10300
06:09:55,240 --> 06:09:56,360
Oh, no.

10301
06:10:02,710 --> 06:10:05,410
I just had less experience.

10302
06:10:05,830 --> 06:10:06,750
Also, like...

10303
06:10:06,750 --> 06:10:13,390
I do... I have like individual male friends more than just groups of guy friends.

10304
06:10:13,870 --> 06:10:14,450
It's similar.

10305
06:10:14,690 --> 06:10:17,490
I don't have a lot of like... I don't have a group of friends.

10306
06:10:17,490 --> 06:10:19,830
I have like individual male friends.

10307
06:10:19,830 --> 06:10:23,130
Similar to like individual female friends, too.

10308
06:10:27,090 --> 06:10:28,490
Oh, this is the first time.

10309
06:10:28,870 --> 06:10:29,650
Oh my god.

10310
06:10:30,230 --> 06:10:30,830
Whoops.

10311
06:10:31,150 --> 06:10:31,950
That's my bad.

10312
06:10:39,330 --> 06:10:40,710
Oh.

10313
06:10:44,250 --> 06:10:45,630
Oh.

10314
06:10:47,330 --> 06:10:47,970
Oh.

10315
06:10:49,170 --> 06:10:49,910
Alright.

10316
06:10:51,610 --> 06:10:52,770
Countered.

10317
06:10:57,090 --> 06:10:58,470
Alright.

10318
06:10:58,890 --> 06:11:00,850
I heard ult and I did it.

10319
06:11:03,810 --> 06:11:04,610
Hello, everybody.

10320
06:11:05,210 --> 06:11:06,230
I shall head over.

10321
06:11:06,410 --> 06:11:08,570
It's not really a fair fight, though, in general.

10322
06:11:08,690 --> 06:11:09,330
Not gonna lie.

10323
06:11:09,330 --> 06:11:09,930
Okay.

10324
06:11:11,970 --> 06:11:12,550
What is it?

10325
06:11:13,430 --> 06:11:14,290
Um...

10326
06:11:14,290 --> 06:11:15,130
They have...

10327
06:11:15,130 --> 06:11:17,850
They have like...

10328
06:11:17,850 --> 06:11:20,190
Several top 500 players.

10329
06:11:23,430 --> 06:11:24,550
Oh, no.

10330
06:11:24,650 --> 06:11:25,030
That's bad.

10331
06:11:28,710 --> 06:11:31,750
They have like three side lucks on, but four really good at anything.

10332
06:11:32,810 --> 06:11:33,210
Woahhhh.

10333
06:11:33,230 --> 06:11:33,690
Can't even matter.

10334
06:11:35,330 --> 06:11:35,510
Oops.

10335
06:11:39,610 --> 06:11:40,290
Alright, I'll TP.

10336
06:11:40,590 --> 06:11:40,790
I'll TP.

10337
06:11:41,010 --> 06:11:41,410
I'll TP.

10338
06:11:41,850 --> 06:11:42,230
Oh.

10339
06:11:43,290 --> 06:11:44,390
That should have hit, though.

10340
06:11:44,710 --> 06:11:45,350
Not gonna lie.

10341
06:11:46,250 --> 06:11:47,010
Should have been here.

10342
06:11:47,690 --> 06:11:48,670
That should have hit.

10343
06:11:48,890 --> 06:11:50,170
I don't know how that didn't hit.

10344
06:11:51,270 --> 06:11:51,970
Down to...

10345
06:11:58,620 --> 06:11:59,600
Hit it.

10346
06:11:59,680 --> 06:11:59,920
Hit it.

10347
06:12:00,100 --> 06:12:00,560
Oh, it's by the way.

10348
06:12:00,880 --> 06:12:01,640
Oh, I caught it like one.

10349
06:12:04,180 --> 06:12:05,360
Oh my god, where am I?

10350
06:12:05,520 --> 06:12:05,940
Where am I?

10351
06:12:06,080 --> 06:12:06,540
Where am I?

10352
06:12:16,730 --> 06:12:18,710
I was thinking, it was just matchmaking.

10353
06:12:19,370 --> 06:12:20,330
There's nothing you can do.

10354
06:12:23,350 --> 06:12:27,910
Literally, their team is like four top 500 players, and then...

10355
06:12:27,910 --> 06:12:30,170
Grateful doesn't even play side, he's not right inside.

10356
06:12:30,250 --> 06:12:31,110
That's crazy, the bitch.

10357
06:12:32,170 --> 06:12:33,570
I'd like to see him on that.

10358
06:12:35,090 --> 06:12:35,750
So what?

10359
06:12:37,010 --> 06:12:39,830
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

10360
06:12:40,310 --> 06:12:42,210
The right heroes could make all the difference.

10361
06:12:43,330 --> 06:12:45,130
Your mic is low.

10362
06:13:04,790 --> 06:13:07,010
Oh, he has this problem with his mic.

10363
06:13:07,690 --> 06:13:08,250
Barely here.

10364
06:13:10,290 --> 06:13:11,870
Nah, I'm not playing this fucking game.

10365
06:13:12,010 --> 06:13:12,470
What the fuck?

10366
06:13:13,030 --> 06:13:14,310
Alright, you just...

10367
06:13:14,310 --> 06:13:16,470
Yeah, you don't know... you don't know Joe, what's here?

10368
06:13:22,250 --> 06:13:24,370
I don't know, I found fucking Gomez yesterday twice.

10369
06:13:24,690 --> 06:13:25,290
He was on 10.

10370
06:13:25,550 --> 06:13:26,710
He got fucking blown up.

10371
06:13:26,870 --> 06:13:27,470
It was insane.

10372
06:13:30,230 --> 06:13:31,510
Crashing out crazy, bro.

10373
06:13:32,050 --> 06:13:34,130
Yeah, Pizza was throwing the game as hard as you, bro.

10374
06:13:37,050 --> 06:13:38,810
Pretty sure you guys went on a losing streak.

10375
06:13:39,190 --> 06:13:41,430
Went off my rank every game, bro.

10376
06:13:42,470 --> 06:13:44,370
What the fuck...

10377
06:13:44,370 --> 06:13:46,110
What is going on?

10378
06:13:48,250 --> 06:13:48,730
Three...

10379
06:13:48,730 --> 06:13:49,130
Two...

10380
06:13:49,130 --> 06:13:49,210
One...

10381
06:13:49,210 --> 06:13:51,290
I fucking worked you guys twice.

10382
06:13:51,330 --> 06:13:52,790
You're right, you're right.

10383
06:13:52,930 --> 06:13:54,110
Who is this guy?

10384
06:13:54,270 --> 06:13:54,870
Who's Joe?

10385
06:13:55,670 --> 06:13:57,150
He's buried by your squad, bro.

10386
06:13:57,390 --> 06:13:58,010
Get over here.

10387
06:13:58,010 --> 06:13:59,170
What the fuck?

10388
06:14:01,330 --> 06:14:01,770
What the fuck?

10389
06:14:01,770 --> 06:14:02,050
What the fuck?

10390
06:14:02,110 --> 06:14:02,250
What the fuck?

10391
06:14:02,250 --> 06:14:04,790
Why are we playing Gomez, like, out of everyone?

10392
06:14:05,790 --> 06:14:07,790
No, it's the... it's ego battle.

10393
06:14:10,150 --> 06:14:11,050
It's like Gomez.

10394
06:14:11,730 --> 06:14:13,410
I'm always fine.

10395
06:14:13,650 --> 06:14:15,330
Put the fucking blame on me at least.

10396
06:14:15,570 --> 06:14:16,010
Like, I don't know.

10397
06:14:17,130 --> 06:14:18,430
You guys rage baiting, bro.

10398
06:14:18,690 --> 06:14:19,350
He's rage baiting.

10399
06:14:20,290 --> 06:14:23,070
Adore, hasn't you hit Slushy at one this season yet or not?

10400
06:14:23,070 --> 06:14:24,310
You are horrible, bro.

10401
06:14:24,530 --> 06:14:25,230
Someone needs a...

10402
06:14:25,230 --> 06:14:27,350
Have you hit Slushy at one this season yet or not?

10403
06:14:27,950 --> 06:14:28,350
Wait...

10404
06:14:28,350 --> 06:14:29,810
You hit Slushy at one yet or not?

10405
06:14:29,990 --> 06:14:30,670
Five hundred games played.

10406
06:14:30,930 --> 06:14:32,690
Have you hit Slushy at one yet or not?

10407
06:14:32,810 --> 06:14:33,670
You've got 500 games played.

10408
06:14:33,870 --> 06:14:33,990
Huh?

10409
06:14:34,530 --> 06:14:34,630
Huh?

10410
06:14:34,890 --> 06:14:36,450
Cuck em, Cuck em, Cuck em.

10411
06:14:36,650 --> 06:14:53,050
Cuck em, Cuck em.

10412
06:14:56,970 --> 06:14:59,270
What the fuck was this?

10413
06:14:59,790 --> 06:15:01,090
What the fuck?

10414
06:15:01,370 --> 06:15:02,690
What a crash.

10415
06:15:05,170 --> 06:15:07,270
Oh my god.

10416
06:15:10,750 --> 06:15:12,350
That's crazy.

10417
06:15:14,070 --> 06:15:16,210
That's actually crazy.

10418
06:15:31,200 --> 06:15:32,900
Oh my god.

10419
06:15:33,200 --> 06:15:35,420
People... I don't know why.

10420
06:15:35,420 --> 06:15:40,060
Like, he picked Gomez to rage that out of everybody.

10421
06:15:40,520 --> 06:15:43,820
I was like, wait, what did he do?

10422
06:15:58,250 --> 06:15:59,470
That was crazy.

10423
06:15:59,790 --> 06:16:01,570
I was like, where did that come from?

10424
06:16:03,570 --> 06:16:04,470
Wait, did he?

10425
06:16:04,690 --> 06:16:04,770
Who?

10426
06:16:10,910 --> 06:16:11,550
Oh.

10427
06:16:17,010 --> 06:16:18,010
Alright, we have...

10428
06:16:25,670 --> 06:16:26,270
Alright.

10429
06:16:27,170 --> 06:16:28,050
Spider-Man?

10430
06:16:28,190 --> 06:16:29,950
What am I playing against that Spider-Man?

10431
06:16:37,430 --> 06:16:40,410
I don't know why his mic is always so fucking low.

10432
06:16:41,230 --> 06:16:42,570
Cause sometimes it's not.

10433
06:16:50,310 --> 06:16:53,150
I don't know why he has not fucking fixed that shit.

10434
06:16:55,390 --> 06:16:56,070
Okay.

10435
06:17:05,940 --> 06:17:06,620
Uh...

10436
06:17:06,620 --> 06:17:07,000
Right

10437
06:17:19,980 --> 06:17:21,720
heroes could make all the difference.

10438
06:17:25,070 --> 06:17:26,170
Could be that.

10439
06:17:26,410 --> 06:17:28,510
I'm just giving him like...

10440
06:17:29,510 --> 06:17:30,770
A little tutorial.

10441
06:17:36,180 --> 06:17:37,540
They're uh...

10442
06:17:37,540 --> 06:17:38,280
They're playing group.

10443
06:17:38,660 --> 06:17:40,000
We're gonna run to counter it.

10444
06:17:43,950 --> 06:17:45,750
You play Punisher, Super Gomez?

10445
06:17:47,870 --> 06:17:48,590
I found...

10446
06:17:52,690 --> 06:17:54,330
No, nobody said it in the tournament.

10447
06:17:54,470 --> 06:17:54,970
I'm just doing ring.

10448
06:17:55,230 --> 06:17:56,290
It's not that hard to play Rocky.

10449
06:17:56,430 --> 06:17:57,130
I can do it if you want.

10450
06:17:57,430 --> 06:17:58,630
Heroes make them safe.

10451
06:17:59,170 --> 06:18:00,250
Yeah, you got it, bro.

10452
06:18:00,890 --> 06:18:01,150
Alright.

10453
06:18:01,510 --> 06:18:03,090
I'll chill out in the back line and right click.

10454
06:18:03,630 --> 06:18:03,930
Let's go.

10455
06:18:07,650 --> 06:18:08,370
Alright, Wolverine.

10456
06:18:10,070 --> 06:18:11,990
Thanks for making my birthday a little brighter.

10457
06:18:12,270 --> 06:18:13,670
Hope the rest of the day goes okay.

10458
06:18:13,850 --> 06:18:14,550
And good night, Dragoon.

10459
06:18:14,630 --> 06:18:14,870
It's coming.

10460
06:18:15,010 --> 06:18:16,250
Thank you for super chat for the spells.

10461
06:18:16,530 --> 06:18:16,950
Thank you, thank you.

10462
06:18:17,030 --> 06:18:17,730
Yeah, me too.

10463
06:18:19,630 --> 06:18:20,070
Uh...

10464
06:18:20,070 --> 06:18:20,610
Cool.

10465
06:18:27,470 --> 06:18:28,590
Alright, lock in.

10466
06:18:29,930 --> 06:18:30,370
Four...

10467
06:18:31,050 --> 06:18:31,490
Three...

10468
06:18:32,090 --> 06:18:32,530
Two...

10469
06:18:32,530 --> 06:18:32,870
One!

10470
06:18:33,910 --> 06:18:36,490
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

10471
06:18:39,390 --> 06:18:41,170
Oh no, it's poop time.

10472
06:18:45,750 --> 06:18:47,190
Oh, I like that little...

10473
06:18:47,190 --> 06:18:48,050
Thank you.

10474
06:18:48,170 --> 06:18:49,150
Alright, Trist in the back.

10475
06:18:52,150 --> 06:18:53,970
Oh, I got your rocket.

10476
06:18:55,410 --> 06:18:56,110
There we go.

10477
06:18:56,510 --> 06:18:56,870
There's...

10478
06:18:56,870 --> 06:18:57,450
Oh my...

10479
06:18:57,450 --> 06:18:59,510
I was gonna say, there's no way we don't kill him.

10480
06:19:00,450 --> 06:19:01,850
But there was a way.

10481
06:19:04,550 --> 06:19:08,030
There was, in fact, a way that we did not kill him.

10482
06:19:10,990 --> 06:19:15,230
I tried so hard to keep them alive, you don't understand.

10483
06:19:15,810 --> 06:19:18,110
I tried so hard.

10484
06:19:20,590 --> 06:19:22,290
Oh my god.

10485
06:19:24,010 --> 06:19:26,030
I hit every heal.

10486
06:19:27,570 --> 06:19:29,950
I hit every heal I could.

10487
06:19:36,990 --> 06:19:39,390
I hit every heal, I swear to god.

10488
06:19:40,570 --> 06:19:42,250
I went pew pew pew.

10489
06:19:49,060 --> 06:19:50,540
I have a problem.

10490
06:19:51,200 --> 06:19:53,120
It's called a rival rival.

10491
06:19:54,260 --> 06:19:55,160
Oh, that sucks.

10492
06:19:55,340 --> 06:19:56,360
I could have used my freeze for him.

10493
06:19:59,860 --> 06:20:00,620
There you go.

10494
06:20:01,560 --> 06:20:02,420
Put it on the Iron Fist.

10495
06:20:02,420 --> 06:20:03,700
I forgot to put it on that.

10496
06:20:09,040 --> 06:20:09,440
Oh!

10497
06:20:10,400 --> 06:20:12,700
Wait, we double support ulted with him.

10498
06:20:13,180 --> 06:20:13,580
Nice.

10499
06:20:18,480 --> 06:20:19,200
Nice, okay.

10500
06:20:20,420 --> 06:20:21,680
Nice, that worked out for us.

10501
06:20:22,160 --> 06:20:25,120
They double support ulted, we double support ulted too.

10502
06:20:28,380 --> 06:20:29,240
This is not good.

10503
06:20:29,360 --> 06:20:30,200
This doesn't work out for us.

10504
06:20:30,400 --> 06:20:31,240
This works out for us.

10505
06:20:34,440 --> 06:20:35,760
This works out for us.

10506
06:20:35,840 --> 06:20:36,240
Nevermind.

10507
06:20:36,480 --> 06:20:38,180
It's like, I'm on a rollercoaster.

10508
06:20:38,300 --> 06:20:38,980
We're so back.

10509
06:20:39,300 --> 06:20:40,660
We're back and we're so back.

10510
06:20:42,680 --> 06:20:44,720
We're back and we're so back, guys.

10511
06:20:56,800 --> 06:20:59,760
I hope he has shield.

10512
06:21:10,030 --> 06:21:11,050
Oh my god.

10513
06:21:19,930 --> 06:21:21,930
I'm trying my best to heal you!

10514
06:21:22,150 --> 06:21:23,130
Oh my god!

10515
06:21:23,450 --> 06:21:25,190
You're a knight because of me, you're welcome!

10516
06:21:28,370 --> 06:21:30,990
That's what I like to call WP.

10517
06:21:32,710 --> 06:21:35,070
See, this is why I am a...

10518
06:21:37,590 --> 06:21:38,170
Okay.

10519
06:21:39,590 --> 06:21:41,090
We don't need to match this yet.

10520
06:21:41,650 --> 06:21:42,230
No.

10521
06:21:43,090 --> 06:21:44,210
Alright, now we do.

10522
06:21:44,890 --> 06:21:46,710
I want us to have...

10523
06:21:46,710 --> 06:21:47,910
more time.

10524
06:21:51,050 --> 06:21:51,630
Unlucky.

10525
06:21:53,090 --> 06:21:56,210
Three, two, one...

10526
06:21:59,750 --> 06:22:00,590
Oh no!

10527
06:22:00,770 --> 06:22:01,270
Oh no!

10528
06:22:01,470 --> 06:22:01,990
Oh no!

10529
06:22:02,210 --> 06:22:03,210
We're so healthy!

10530
06:22:08,980 --> 06:22:10,460
We're gonna have Emma.

10531
06:22:10,600 --> 06:22:12,260
No, let's do it.

10532
06:22:16,540 --> 06:22:17,220
No.

10533
06:22:22,570 --> 06:22:23,670
Oh my god.

10534
06:22:24,370 --> 06:22:25,990
I'm trying to...

10535
06:22:25,990 --> 06:22:28,350
I'm trying to...

10536
06:22:30,630 --> 06:22:30,970
Jesus.

10537
06:22:32,110 --> 06:22:33,190
Wait, it's Joe again.

10538
06:22:33,830 --> 06:22:34,990
Oh wait!

10539
06:22:35,290 --> 06:22:37,570
Why did none of them avoid each other?

10540
06:22:40,650 --> 06:22:41,610
It's Joe again.

10541
06:22:46,150 --> 06:22:47,330
Wait, it's these two.

10542
06:22:53,470 --> 06:22:53,910
Ohhhh!

10543
06:22:55,230 --> 06:22:55,950
That's unlucky.

10544
06:22:56,530 --> 06:22:57,370
Please, please, please, please.

10545
06:22:57,610 --> 06:22:57,950
Please.

10546
06:22:59,530 --> 06:23:00,350
Oh my god.

10547
06:23:00,990 --> 06:23:01,430
Oh my god.

10548
06:23:01,430 --> 06:23:02,050
Oh my god, I made it.

10549
06:23:02,330 --> 06:23:03,610
Oh my god, I made it.

10550
06:23:03,610 --> 06:23:06,450
I actually just got my ult just in time.

10551
06:23:07,430 --> 06:23:08,150
Oh my god.

10552
06:23:10,750 --> 06:23:12,110
How did...

10553
06:23:12,110 --> 06:23:14,870
I'm just surprised they're both...

10554
06:23:14,870 --> 06:23:17,750
Like, either of them didn't avoid each other.

10555
06:23:33,350 --> 06:23:33,790
Okay.

10556
06:23:35,870 --> 06:23:39,290
You know, with both of them hating each other, you think they, you know...

10557
06:23:41,330 --> 06:23:41,770
Not...

10558
06:23:45,510 --> 06:23:46,130
Oh god.

10559
06:23:46,950 --> 06:23:47,690
Oh god.

10560
06:23:47,930 --> 06:23:48,530
Please tell me.

10561
06:23:48,730 --> 06:23:48,910
No!

10562
06:23:53,600 --> 06:23:54,940
I don't have...

10563
06:23:54,940 --> 06:23:57,220
This is bad, because I don't have...

10564
06:23:57,220 --> 06:23:59,020
Because I don't have...

10565
06:23:59,020 --> 06:24:02,480
See, I used it to try and save our mag, but it didn't save him.

10566
06:24:06,480 --> 06:24:07,680
That was too close.

10567
06:24:07,680 --> 06:24:08,820
I'm making a comeback.

10568
06:24:10,500 --> 06:24:14,120
I'm still, like, just as surprised that either of them didn't avoid each other.

10569
06:24:14,680 --> 06:24:15,680
I am...

10570
06:24:16,660 --> 06:24:17,680
You know, you think that...

10571
06:24:18,560 --> 06:24:20,900
Oh my god, I saw him at the last minute.

10572
06:24:21,160 --> 06:24:21,360
Fuck!

10573
06:24:21,700 --> 06:24:22,940
I was like, where is he?

10574
06:24:23,780 --> 06:24:25,380
Oh, that's so unlucky.

10575
06:24:26,160 --> 06:24:27,960
I saw that at the last second.

10576
06:24:42,130 --> 06:24:43,830
Oh my god, I knew it was gonna...

10577
06:24:43,830 --> 06:24:44,910
Oh my god.

10578
06:24:45,250 --> 06:24:46,430
This is the best I could do.

10579
06:24:49,070 --> 06:24:50,470
Oh ho...

10580
06:24:50,470 --> 06:24:52,890
No, I was at 91.

10581
06:24:55,390 --> 06:24:56,590
That sucks.

10582
06:24:57,230 --> 06:24:58,310
I was at 91.

10583
06:25:03,950 --> 06:25:04,750
Jesus.

10584
06:25:06,630 --> 06:25:07,430
Yeah.

10585
06:25:08,690 --> 06:25:09,610
I think...

10586
06:25:09,610 --> 06:25:11,190
I could play Loki, honestly.

10587
06:25:11,570 --> 06:25:12,510
Loki might be better.

10588
06:25:16,050 --> 06:25:17,550
Oh, that's unlucky.

10589
06:25:19,590 --> 06:25:21,770
Just for the...

10590
06:25:22,210 --> 06:25:23,070
Just for lamps.

10591
06:25:26,330 --> 06:25:26,670
Nice.

10592
06:25:30,770 --> 06:25:32,110
Where's my rocket?

10593
06:25:32,870 --> 06:25:34,170
I'm trying to...

10594
06:25:34,530 --> 06:25:37,270
I'm trying to save my rocket, but I'm like, where is he?

10595
06:25:37,270 --> 06:25:39,390
I don't know where he is.

10596
06:25:40,690 --> 06:25:41,250
I

10597
06:25:50,010 --> 06:25:52,550
don't know where he is.

10598
06:25:54,790 --> 06:25:55,810
Oh my god.

10599
06:25:56,030 --> 06:25:56,570
Oh my god.

10600
06:25:56,730 --> 06:25:58,710
Somebody get this wild animal.

10601
06:25:59,470 --> 06:26:00,230
Wait.

10602
06:26:01,110 --> 06:26:01,910
I'll be like...

10603
06:26:02,310 --> 06:26:02,690
Uh...

10604
06:26:02,690 --> 06:26:03,310
Yield first.

10605
06:26:07,650 --> 06:26:08,410
Alright.

10606
06:26:11,530 --> 06:26:12,450
Hey, Joe's back.

10607
06:26:15,390 --> 06:26:16,610
Joe's back in the VC.

10608
06:26:16,610 --> 06:26:16,690
Please.

10609
06:26:29,150 --> 06:26:30,450
Joe's done raging.

10610
06:26:33,590 --> 06:26:34,530
He missed.

10611
06:26:36,430 --> 06:26:38,570
This is a really hard point though.

10612
06:26:39,470 --> 06:26:40,470
In general.

10613
06:26:40,470 --> 06:26:42,590
This is real firepower!

10614
06:26:45,010 --> 06:26:45,590
Nice.

10615
06:26:46,090 --> 06:26:46,750
Oh, nice.

10616
06:26:47,230 --> 06:26:49,710
The current score is...

10617
06:26:49,710 --> 06:26:49,950
Zero.

10618
06:26:50,250 --> 06:26:50,910
Joe's back!

10619
06:26:51,330 --> 06:26:52,410
He's back to play!

10620
06:26:53,850 --> 06:26:55,470
Time to switch things up.

10621
06:26:55,790 --> 06:26:57,610
Including which side you're on.

10622
06:27:00,030 --> 06:27:00,850
I'm Luna Snow.

10623
06:27:01,070 --> 06:27:01,470
Alright.

10624
06:27:01,690 --> 06:27:02,730
I feel...

10625
06:27:03,470 --> 06:27:05,850
I'm happy that I actually get to play Luna Snow.

10626
06:27:06,210 --> 06:27:07,690
I'm gonna try Invis to pull up the wolf.

10627
06:27:07,810 --> 06:27:08,370
Is he a problem?

10628
06:27:08,370 --> 06:27:09,530
No, no, no.

10629
06:27:11,830 --> 06:27:13,630
It's only a little bit cancer, but...

10630
06:27:13,630 --> 06:27:13,950
Yay!

10631
06:27:16,710 --> 06:27:17,250
Low key?

10632
06:27:17,430 --> 06:27:18,370
We don't really need low key.

10633
06:27:20,630 --> 06:27:23,810
Uh, it's the only thing at low key, if the Wolverine was a big problem.

10634
06:27:24,050 --> 06:27:26,170
But he's not as big of a problem as I think he is.

10635
06:27:26,470 --> 06:27:27,250
I don't know why.

10636
06:27:28,290 --> 06:27:29,090
I don't know why.

10637
06:27:29,350 --> 06:27:31,210
His mic is so low.

10638
06:27:32,070 --> 06:27:33,330
It's been like a problem.

10639
06:27:33,950 --> 06:27:34,570
I'm playing with...

10640
06:27:34,570 --> 06:27:35,230
With a...

10641
06:27:35,230 --> 06:27:36,130
Ear infection.

10642
06:27:36,190 --> 06:27:37,490
I'm playing with like...

10643
06:27:37,490 --> 06:27:39,010
Like poor sleep.

10644
06:27:39,090 --> 06:27:39,810
I'm just like...

10645
06:27:39,810 --> 06:27:40,070
I'm...

10646
06:27:40,070 --> 06:27:40,590
I'm cocked.

10647
06:27:41,210 --> 06:27:42,630
And the real one plays it through.

10648
06:27:42,890 --> 06:27:43,090
Come on now.

10649
06:27:43,970 --> 06:27:44,370
I'm cocked.

10650
06:27:44,450 --> 06:27:45,150
The best time to play.

10651
06:27:45,650 --> 06:27:46,510
You'll be okay.

10652
06:27:46,510 --> 06:27:47,110
You'll miss.

10653
06:27:53,040 --> 06:27:54,120
I am Groot.

10654
06:27:56,100 --> 06:27:57,280
I am Groot.

10655
06:27:57,280 --> 06:27:59,080
I just beat that Donatello kid.

10656
06:27:59,720 --> 06:28:00,360
I am Groot.

10657
06:28:00,360 --> 06:28:01,040
I just beat that Donatello kid.

10658
06:28:01,040 --> 06:28:03,020
I am Groot.

10659
06:28:07,500 --> 06:28:10,680
Yeah, he just has that one big uh...

10660
06:28:10,680 --> 06:28:11,000
Four...

10661
06:28:11,000 --> 06:28:11,320
Three...

10662
06:28:12,620 --> 06:28:13,260
Two...

10663
06:28:15,010 --> 06:28:15,950
One...

10664
06:28:15,950 --> 06:28:16,770
Who's throwing?

10665
06:28:16,770 --> 06:28:16,950
One...

10666
06:28:18,550 --> 06:28:19,250
One...

10667
06:28:24,010 --> 06:28:24,310
One...

10668
06:28:24,310 --> 06:28:25,010
One...

10669
06:28:28,460 --> 06:28:28,580
One...

10670
06:28:28,580 --> 06:28:29,280
One...

10671
06:28:29,700 --> 06:28:29,780
One...

10672
06:28:29,780 --> 06:28:30,420
One...

10673
06:28:30,420 --> 06:28:30,440
One...

10674
06:28:30,440 --> 06:28:31,020
One...

10675
06:28:31,020 --> 06:28:31,420
One...

10676
06:28:31,420 --> 06:28:32,280
One...

10677
06:28:32,280 --> 06:28:33,320
One...

10678
06:28:33,320 --> 06:28:35,540
One...

10679
06:28:35,540 --> 06:28:37,500
One...

10680
06:28:37,500 --> 06:28:39,240
One...

10681
06:28:39,240 --> 06:28:40,520
One...

10682
06:28:40,520 --> 06:28:40,800
One...

10683
06:28:40,800 --> 06:28:41,740
One...

10684
06:28:41,740 --> 06:28:43,700
One...

10685
06:28:43,700 --> 06:28:44,060
One...

10686
06:28:44,060 --> 06:28:44,100
One...

10687
06:28:44,100 --> 06:28:45,120
One...

10688
06:28:45,120 --> 06:28:47,360
One...

10689
06:28:51,640 --> 06:28:53,040
One...

10690
06:28:53,040 --> 06:28:54,740
Oh, is it the one that went Widow?

10691
06:28:58,560 --> 06:29:00,160
I'm a little scared right now.

10692
06:29:00,320 --> 06:29:00,840
Yeah, I'm dead.

10693
06:29:02,920 --> 06:29:04,040
Did he Diff him?

10694
06:29:04,240 --> 06:29:06,340
Wait, he's still getting spawned!

10695
06:29:12,780 --> 06:29:14,920
Guys, I don't think he Diffed him.

10696
06:29:17,660 --> 06:29:19,560
Guys, I don't think he Diffed him.

10697
06:29:29,550 --> 06:29:29,990
Alright.

10698
06:29:32,630 --> 06:29:34,830
Is it really just... He's healing right now.

10699
06:29:34,990 --> 06:29:35,650
I'm gonna grab him.

10700
06:29:35,910 --> 06:29:37,170
Or cry too, at least, when he comes.

10701
06:29:39,790 --> 06:29:40,750
Burn him, burn him, burn him!

10702
06:29:41,250 --> 06:29:42,030
Nice, alright.

10703
06:29:43,870 --> 06:29:45,390
Hey, everybody's friends now!

10704
06:29:45,950 --> 06:29:46,810
Isn't that great?

10705
06:29:48,250 --> 06:29:50,210
I'm a little worried about...

10706
06:29:50,710 --> 06:29:54,370
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say, I'm a little worried, because I feel like he's coming back.

10707
06:29:56,930 --> 06:29:58,570
Okay, that's the best I can do.

10708
06:30:05,780 --> 06:30:06,300
Okay.

10709
06:30:06,420 --> 06:30:06,600
Okay.

10710
06:30:06,800 --> 06:30:07,920
Got him, got him, got him, got him!

10711
06:30:08,560 --> 06:30:09,440
Where is he?

10712
06:30:15,130 --> 06:30:15,950
Okay, nice.

10713
06:30:16,590 --> 06:30:17,390
They're down there, too.

10714
06:30:18,630 --> 06:30:19,010
That's why.

10715
06:30:21,630 --> 06:30:22,690
Hey, y'all first.

10716
06:30:29,390 --> 06:30:29,930
Third TP.

10717
06:30:34,490 --> 06:30:35,590
I'm gonna grab...

10718
06:30:36,210 --> 06:30:37,190
Where is that?

10719
06:30:44,760 --> 06:30:45,560
Okay.

10720
06:30:52,560 --> 06:30:55,700
Come on, I'm damaging boosting him.

10721
06:30:56,020 --> 06:30:57,900
Okay, let me damage boost him again.

10722
06:30:59,280 --> 06:31:00,080
Nice!

10723
06:31:01,300 --> 06:31:01,620
Yay!

10724
06:31:02,360 --> 06:31:02,860
Yippee!

10725
06:31:04,900 --> 06:31:06,280
Is he still throwing?

10726
06:31:06,880 --> 06:31:07,560
Okay.

10727
06:31:08,580 --> 06:31:09,420
Now he's on...

10728
06:31:09,420 --> 06:31:10,440
Now he's on...

10729
06:31:10,920 --> 06:31:11,300
Aka.

10730
06:31:12,680 --> 06:31:14,440
Just who I was looking for.

10731
06:31:17,310 --> 06:31:20,270
I mean, their Iron Fist is, like, annoying.

10732
06:31:20,910 --> 06:31:21,530
As hell.

10733
06:31:27,490 --> 06:31:30,010
Aka is just good to punish...

10734
06:31:30,730 --> 06:31:31,770
People who are...

10735
06:31:32,770 --> 06:31:34,050
Iron Fist in the back.

10736
06:31:37,050 --> 06:31:38,850
Oh, he blocked it?

10737
06:31:39,070 --> 06:31:39,590
Goddammit.

10738
06:31:39,770 --> 06:31:40,310
That's unlucky.

10739
06:31:40,870 --> 06:31:42,690
That's unlucky that he blocked it.

10740
06:31:48,150 --> 06:31:49,570
I haven't even blocked it.

10741
06:31:49,670 --> 06:31:50,430
I got the threes.

10742
06:32:02,020 --> 06:32:02,640
Oh.

10743
06:32:11,950 --> 06:32:12,570
Okay.

10744
06:32:13,710 --> 06:32:14,070
Okay.

10745
06:32:18,910 --> 06:32:19,670
Nice threat.

10746
06:32:20,830 --> 06:32:23,550
Oh, that CS saved us so many times.

10747
06:32:26,090 --> 06:32:27,930
I just don't wanna get Hawkeye.

10748
06:32:28,070 --> 06:32:29,010
I'm gonna say that.

10749
06:32:29,110 --> 06:32:30,170
I'm gonna get Hawkeye.

10750
06:32:35,170 --> 06:32:36,750
Alright, this is on me in the back.

10751
06:32:37,590 --> 06:32:38,030
Wait.

10752
06:32:38,670 --> 06:32:39,630
Oh, I didn't see him.

10753
06:32:44,470 --> 06:32:45,310
That's unlucky.

10754
06:32:47,950 --> 06:32:49,250
I'm just gonna die right now.

10755
06:32:50,150 --> 06:32:51,170
He's killing me now.

10756
06:32:51,330 --> 06:32:52,150
Oh my god!

10757
06:32:52,310 --> 06:32:53,230
Are you really gonna...

10758
06:32:53,230 --> 06:32:54,030
Okay, I was gonna stay.

10759
06:32:57,490 --> 06:33:00,650
If I knew earlier, I would have come back to heal our...

10760
06:33:01,330 --> 06:33:01,570
Guy.

10761
06:33:11,900 --> 06:33:13,580
Oh, I couldn't do it in time.

10762
06:33:28,810 --> 06:33:30,670
I have to do this for him.

10763
06:33:33,950 --> 06:33:35,530
I'm just gonna make sure I don't get...

10764
06:33:35,530 --> 06:33:35,650
I'm just gonna make sure I don't get...

10765
06:33:35,650 --> 06:33:36,190
We have Luna on.

10766
06:33:37,450 --> 06:33:38,950
Yeah, they don't have any squirrels.

10767
06:33:44,970 --> 06:33:47,670
I'm gonna try and see if we can do anything here.

10768
06:33:49,470 --> 06:33:49,990
Nice.

10769
06:33:51,510 --> 06:33:52,030
Alright.

10770
06:33:52,810 --> 06:33:54,630
They have Wolverine also.

10771
06:33:55,710 --> 06:33:57,810
I am a little free there.

10772
06:33:58,490 --> 06:33:59,650
Here it is.

10773
06:33:59,650 --> 06:33:59,870
There it is.

10774
06:34:02,950 --> 06:34:04,090
I called it.

10775
06:34:04,190 --> 06:34:05,190
I just got fucked by the building.

10776
06:34:05,890 --> 06:34:07,470
I don't have to be center stage.

10777
06:34:07,790 --> 06:34:08,670
I called it.

10778
06:34:12,270 --> 06:34:13,130
I knew it.

10779
06:34:13,250 --> 06:34:13,710
I was lit.

10780
06:34:15,750 --> 06:34:16,130
Here we go.

10781
06:34:16,870 --> 06:34:17,050
Oh!

10782
06:34:25,070 --> 06:34:28,030
The CS saved my team so many times.

10783
06:34:28,530 --> 06:34:29,310
Thank god.

10784
06:34:35,250 --> 06:34:37,770
I need to, like, make sure where the...

10785
06:34:37,770 --> 06:34:38,570
Oh, there he is.

10786
06:34:39,050 --> 06:34:40,170
Aw, he blocked it.

10787
06:34:41,130 --> 06:34:41,610
Unlucky.

10788
06:34:44,830 --> 06:34:45,310
Unlucky.

10789
06:34:46,070 --> 06:34:49,030
He blocked it.

10790
06:34:52,670 --> 06:34:53,390
Oh my god.

10791
06:34:53,590 --> 06:34:55,310
Play high, you know, it's so scary!

10792
06:34:55,310 --> 06:34:58,750
Yo, if you go for an ult, I can, uh, Iron Man ult.

10793
06:35:04,740 --> 06:35:05,640
Alright, nice.

10794
06:35:07,820 --> 06:35:09,080
He ult, he ult through it.

10795
06:35:14,420 --> 06:35:14,900
Yay!

10796
06:35:20,420 --> 06:35:20,900
Yay!

10797
06:35:22,020 --> 06:35:24,020
With friendship, we did it!

10798
06:35:25,580 --> 06:35:26,060
Yippee!

10799
06:35:26,060 --> 06:35:26,100
Yay!

10800
06:35:27,380 --> 06:35:29,600
This Jalut guy didn't avoid me.

10801
06:35:29,900 --> 06:35:30,360
I don't know why.

10802
06:35:34,530 --> 06:35:36,650
Another epic victory!

10803
06:35:41,330 --> 06:35:42,130
Yippee!

10804
06:35:45,370 --> 06:35:46,170
Yippee!

10805
06:35:59,290 --> 06:36:00,090
Yippee!

10806
06:36:00,090 --> 06:36:01,290
Friendship, everyone!

10807
06:36:02,450 --> 06:36:03,750
We did it!

10808
06:36:04,030 --> 06:36:06,210
Joe and Gomez are okay now!

10809
06:36:06,950 --> 06:36:08,210
We have more tissue over there.

10810
06:36:17,590 --> 06:36:18,650
Okay, I need to know.

10811
06:36:19,490 --> 06:36:24,790
Why does streaming make me, like, make me produce more...

10812
06:36:28,350 --> 06:36:29,510
More... Is it mucus?

10813
06:36:29,670 --> 06:36:30,230
Is that what it's called?

10814
06:36:31,230 --> 06:36:33,110
Is that what the term is?

10815
06:36:33,890 --> 06:36:35,270
Why does it do that?

10816
06:36:35,690 --> 06:36:36,550
Hello, everybody.

10817
06:36:38,130 --> 06:36:38,990
Sup, sexy?

10818
06:36:39,670 --> 06:36:41,310
Only happens when I stream.

10819
06:36:41,930 --> 06:36:42,890
When I stream?

10820
06:36:44,250 --> 06:36:46,310
Like, I always have to blow my nose.

10821
06:36:47,250 --> 06:36:48,210
No, it's not.

10822
06:36:48,390 --> 06:36:48,690
No, it's not.

10823
06:36:49,790 --> 06:36:50,470
Is it?

10824
06:36:50,770 --> 06:36:51,150
Is that?

10825
06:36:51,270 --> 06:36:52,570
Because I always have to blow my nose.

10826
06:36:52,990 --> 06:36:53,830
Oh my god.

10827
06:36:55,730 --> 06:36:56,630
No, no, no, no, no.

10828
06:36:58,910 --> 06:36:59,910
Is it the talking?

10829
06:37:00,270 --> 06:37:01,610
Do you talk too much?

10830
06:37:02,590 --> 06:37:06,050
No, I... I have to blow my nose every time.

10831
06:37:12,290 --> 06:37:14,390
I use up like...

10832
06:37:14,390 --> 06:37:20,290
I use up half my tissue box every... almost... not almost half, like one-third my tissue box every stream.

10833
06:37:20,630 --> 06:37:23,590
So I have to go buy more, like, boxes of tissues.

10834
06:37:23,590 --> 06:37:27,950
I have... I have... I have... serious fucking cramps at the moment.

10835
06:37:28,450 --> 06:37:33,570
And I have... I have, like, maybe, like, sleep insomnia because my cat keeps waking me up to feed him.

10836
06:37:34,110 --> 06:37:35,510
Oh, you got a cat that's sick.

10837
06:37:36,530 --> 06:37:43,830
He took all of that and is like... I like... He's like, my cat keeps waking me up and the other guy's like, yo, that's so cool.

10838
06:37:43,970 --> 06:37:44,670
You got a cat.

10839
06:37:44,810 --> 06:37:45,290
Bro.

10840
06:37:52,510 --> 06:37:54,750
Bro, that's so cool.

10841
06:37:55,130 --> 06:37:56,370
I mean, I like the magic too.

10842
06:37:56,410 --> 06:37:57,750
You don't have to go Groot.

10843
06:37:58,190 --> 06:37:59,310
No, I have to.

10844
06:37:59,790 --> 06:38:01,390
I'm bad at Groot.

10845
06:38:02,770 --> 06:38:03,910
I'm Groot OTP.

10846
06:38:05,210 --> 06:38:06,650
Yeah, I'm Groot OTP.

10847
06:38:06,670 --> 06:38:07,350
I'm Groot OTP.

10848
06:38:07,550 --> 06:38:08,470
No, wait, that's a lie.

10849
06:38:08,610 --> 06:38:08,890
That's a demo.

10850
06:38:08,990 --> 06:38:10,630
I see you play Hulk a season ago.

10851
06:38:10,630 --> 06:38:11,690
I'm Groot OTP.

10852
06:38:12,270 --> 06:38:13,090
He doesn't play Hulk.

10853
06:38:13,690 --> 06:38:15,150
Oh my god, what if I play Hulk?

10854
06:38:15,390 --> 06:38:15,910
What are you talking about?

10855
06:38:15,930 --> 06:38:16,770
No, I don't play Hulk.

10856
06:38:18,770 --> 06:38:20,250
I'm the worst Hulk in the world.

10857
06:38:21,890 --> 06:38:23,510
I'm so ugly.

10858
06:38:25,190 --> 06:38:26,590
What if I win?

10859
06:38:27,190 --> 06:38:28,230
I'm so ugly.

10860
06:38:30,490 --> 06:38:32,330
Oh man, can you go live so I can farm your viewers?

10861
06:38:32,950 --> 06:38:33,610
No, motherfucker.

10862
06:38:34,010 --> 06:38:34,810
What the fuck is this?

10863
06:38:36,550 --> 06:38:37,970
You don't miss me if you're tapped in?

10864
06:38:39,170 --> 06:38:39,890
Can I get a host?

10865
06:38:40,210 --> 06:38:40,210
Can I get a ring?

10866
06:38:41,110 --> 06:38:42,230
No, I'll take it.

10867
06:38:42,230 --> 06:38:43,590
How much are we at range?

10868
06:38:43,590 --> 06:38:44,130
How much are we at range?

10869
06:38:44,510 --> 06:38:47,810
He's the most fat fucking deranged DD little pizza shit.

10870
06:38:48,290 --> 06:38:52,470
No, I used to be... no, no, no, no.

10871
06:38:53,430 --> 06:38:55,190
I used to be a big ass guy, okay?

10872
06:38:55,570 --> 06:38:56,790
He gets the pass.

10873
06:38:57,170 --> 06:38:58,750
He gets the pass guys.

10874
06:38:59,070 --> 06:39:00,070
He used to be fatty.

10875
06:39:00,070 --> 06:39:01,850
He thought should be... no, yo!

10876
06:39:05,130 --> 06:39:06,670
I can't believe he loves.

10877
06:39:06,670 --> 06:39:10,730
I can't believe... he means that I get... I used to be fat so I can say that.

10878
06:39:10,990 --> 06:39:12,830
That's freaking wild.

10879
06:39:13,690 --> 06:39:14,290
Hahahaha.

10880
06:39:15,150 --> 06:39:15,830
That's what it's like.

10881
06:39:19,630 --> 06:39:20,830
HAHAHA Ele's fast.

10882
06:39:20,830 --> 06:39:20,830
Guys.

10883
06:39:20,970 --> 06:39:21,970
He gets the pass guys.

10884
06:39:33,510 --> 06:39:36,550
I swear to god, if we did not kill him, I swear.

10885
06:39:38,670 --> 06:39:39,570
Heal my Emma.

10886
06:39:39,670 --> 06:39:41,170
Heal my Emma ever, bro.

10887
06:39:42,630 --> 06:39:45,190
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10888
06:39:45,290 --> 06:39:46,850
You can never admit it was your fault.

10889
06:39:47,210 --> 06:39:48,230
It's never you.

10890
06:39:48,830 --> 06:39:49,810
Flame your healers.

10891
06:39:49,930 --> 06:39:50,270
No, no, no.

10892
06:39:50,390 --> 06:39:50,990
It's never you.

10893
06:39:50,990 --> 06:39:51,710
Flame your healers.

10894
06:39:51,750 --> 06:39:52,050
Yeah.

10895
06:39:52,630 --> 06:39:54,410
It's a god damn pat, bro.

10896
06:39:55,270 --> 06:39:56,950
Brother, I just started my ass.

10897
06:39:57,510 --> 06:39:59,970
You go, you go, like, heal me.

10898
06:40:00,150 --> 06:40:01,010
You go, like, heal me.

10899
06:40:01,850 --> 06:40:02,490
Oh my god.

10900
06:40:03,790 --> 06:40:04,070
Okay.

10901
06:40:07,510 --> 06:40:09,090
You like that, like that, like that.

10902
06:40:11,870 --> 06:40:12,750
Oh my...

10903
06:40:12,750 --> 06:40:15,550
Oh my...

10904
06:40:15,550 --> 06:40:17,310
Oh my god!

10905
06:40:17,310 --> 06:40:17,870
Oh my god!

10906
06:40:18,110 --> 06:40:20,570
Oh my god!

10907
06:40:20,890 --> 06:40:21,530
Oh my god!

10908
06:40:23,490 --> 06:40:23,930
That's...

10909
06:40:23,930 --> 06:40:24,830
Go live, quick, quick!

10910
06:40:25,070 --> 06:40:26,370
Go live, right now!

10911
06:40:28,410 --> 06:40:30,450
It's okay, they side on my stream.

10912
06:40:30,750 --> 06:40:31,130
No, no, no.

10913
06:40:31,290 --> 06:40:32,050
We have Doki.

10914
06:40:32,210 --> 06:40:33,070
Doki has his stream.

10915
06:40:33,570 --> 06:40:35,790
It's okay, they side on my stream.

10916
06:40:36,530 --> 06:40:37,250
Oh my god.

10917
06:40:37,470 --> 06:40:38,150
We need to be...

10918
06:40:38,150 --> 06:40:40,530
Bro, I didn't get any of the assists.

10919
06:40:40,830 --> 06:40:42,250
I didn't get any of the assists, bro.

10920
06:40:42,250 --> 06:40:43,010
I got none.

10921
06:40:43,490 --> 06:40:44,330
I got none.

10922
06:40:44,330 --> 06:40:45,070
I got none, cause I died.

10923
06:40:45,590 --> 06:40:46,330
Oh, fine.

10924
06:40:46,670 --> 06:40:47,730
No, they have an EVs now.

10925
06:40:48,050 --> 06:40:48,250
I'm cool.

10926
06:40:49,390 --> 06:40:50,630
They have an endgame, huh?

10927
06:40:50,810 --> 06:40:51,210
Wake up.

10928
06:40:51,370 --> 06:40:52,010
Wait, it's pizza.

10929
06:40:54,570 --> 06:40:55,950
I got beefed with pizza, man.

10930
06:40:56,110 --> 06:40:56,890
That guy feels all my game.

10931
06:40:58,550 --> 06:40:59,950
Oh, tell me about it.

10932
06:41:00,090 --> 06:41:01,370
I definitely didn't play with him yesterday.

10933
06:41:01,570 --> 06:41:04,650
I brought from one game off of Celestial to...

10934
06:41:04,650 --> 06:41:05,950
Alright, there's some of these too.

10935
06:41:06,170 --> 06:41:07,350
Where am I now?

10936
06:41:07,630 --> 06:41:08,150
Middle of GM.

10937
06:41:08,210 --> 06:41:09,310
Jermis, clip that!

10938
06:41:09,690 --> 06:41:10,610
Jermis, clip that!

10939
06:41:10,890 --> 06:41:12,190
You are not GM right now.

10940
06:41:12,530 --> 06:41:13,550
Oh, sorry, sorry.

10941
06:41:13,670 --> 06:41:14,310
Celestial to you.

10942
06:41:14,370 --> 06:41:14,790
I forgot this.

10943
06:41:15,210 --> 06:41:15,290
He's stuck!

10944
06:41:15,290 --> 06:41:15,970
I'm hardstuck.

10945
06:41:15,970 --> 06:41:17,230
I'm hardstuck GM, bro.

10946
06:41:19,130 --> 06:41:20,190
Guys, this is why...

10947
06:41:20,190 --> 06:41:22,930
I'm sorry, this is why I have more male friends.

10948
06:41:24,850 --> 06:41:26,950
How's that XTC tournament?

10949
06:41:29,170 --> 06:41:30,330
I'm a friend of WF.

10950
06:41:30,330 --> 06:41:31,850
Right here...

10951
06:41:37,720 --> 06:41:38,400
Yo, Gomez.

10952
06:41:38,900 --> 06:41:39,480
Can I be...

10953
06:41:39,480 --> 06:41:40,260
Can I be on the bench?

10954
06:41:40,460 --> 06:41:40,840
Pretend those?

10955
06:41:41,760 --> 06:41:42,760
You need water, boy.

10956
06:41:43,420 --> 06:41:44,320
Can I be on the bench or anything?

10957
06:41:45,020 --> 06:41:46,000
Yeah, dude, no, go ahead.

10958
06:41:46,000 --> 06:41:47,040
Please allow me to be on the bench.

10959
06:41:47,340 --> 06:41:47,500
I was fine.

10960
06:41:47,760 --> 06:41:48,580
I said yes.

10961
06:41:49,300 --> 06:41:49,800
Wait, really?

10962
06:41:50,580 --> 06:41:50,920
No.

10963
06:41:51,260 --> 06:41:52,240
Wait, get the contract ready.

10964
06:41:52,900 --> 06:41:53,940
No, I don't mind.

10965
06:41:54,400 --> 06:41:55,980
Alright, look, you get ult first.

10966
06:41:57,760 --> 06:41:59,660
Yo, am I ready for another one?

10967
06:42:00,340 --> 06:42:00,960
Yo, fuck.

10968
06:42:01,440 --> 06:42:02,880
I'm gonna take care of so many counters.

10969
06:42:05,000 --> 06:42:05,900
Like, we're looking for an ult.

10970
06:42:06,020 --> 06:42:06,500
He's in for now.

10971
06:42:10,810 --> 06:42:11,110
Maximum!

10972
06:42:11,490 --> 06:42:12,690
I'm taking him off the map!

10973
06:42:13,050 --> 06:42:13,350
Yeah!

10974
06:42:16,970 --> 06:42:18,210
Go, guys, go, guys, go, guys, go!

10975
06:42:19,870 --> 06:42:20,170
What?

10976
06:42:21,190 --> 06:42:22,310
No, no, no.

10977
06:42:22,650 --> 06:42:23,210
No, no, no.

10978
06:42:24,070 --> 06:42:25,090
We have time to get back.

10979
06:42:25,210 --> 06:42:25,630
We come, bro.

10980
06:42:25,770 --> 06:42:26,390
We have time to get back.

10981
06:42:26,630 --> 06:42:27,690
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10982
06:42:28,530 --> 06:42:29,210
I'm walling up.

10983
06:42:29,370 --> 06:42:29,510
I'm walling up.

10984
06:42:29,510 --> 06:42:30,150
Everybody go hide.

10985
06:42:30,710 --> 06:42:31,370
I'm walling up.

10986
06:42:31,370 --> 06:42:32,890
Five main doodle into memory.

10987
06:42:33,570 --> 06:42:34,530
Yeah, I don't know.

10988
06:42:34,530 --> 06:42:35,450
I don't know about this one.

10989
06:42:35,470 --> 06:42:36,250
I don't know about this one.

10990
06:42:36,430 --> 06:42:37,330
Six this time.

10991
06:42:38,290 --> 06:42:39,010
I'm ready.

10992
06:42:39,490 --> 06:42:40,190
Yo, get on point though.

10993
06:42:41,170 --> 06:42:41,930
Yo, what if I told you?

10994
06:42:41,930 --> 06:42:43,070
What if I told you?

10995
06:42:44,170 --> 06:42:45,670
I had a feeling we're not gonna fuck that.

10996
06:42:45,710 --> 06:42:47,170
What if I told you I got frozen?

10997
06:42:47,490 --> 06:42:48,130
I did.

10998
06:42:48,410 --> 06:42:49,330
I got flushed, bro.

10999
06:42:52,210 --> 06:42:55,190
Bro, this shit is way harder than ho- Like, how do you play through?

11000
06:42:55,230 --> 06:42:56,830
Why is there coming to counters to fucking Wolverine, bro?

11001
06:42:57,370 --> 06:42:58,250
Fuck my character.

11002
06:42:58,470 --> 06:42:59,230
Look at that.

11003
06:42:59,410 --> 06:43:00,230
I got pushed.

11004
06:43:02,430 --> 06:43:02,870
Okay.

11005
06:43:02,970 --> 06:43:04,210
Buff on Wolverine, bro.

11006
06:43:05,850 --> 06:43:06,630
Same, bro.

11007
06:43:06,910 --> 06:43:07,270
Buff through.

11008
06:43:07,810 --> 06:43:10,010
Dude, everyone in the cast counters this fucker.

11009
06:43:12,730 --> 06:43:15,230
I can even, like, ten characters that counter won't bring in.

11010
06:43:15,510 --> 06:43:15,790
Alright.

11011
06:43:16,670 --> 06:43:18,250
I almost get mad when I play Jeff, bro.

11012
06:43:18,350 --> 06:43:18,670
Buff Jeff.

11013
06:43:19,870 --> 06:43:20,570
Oh, fuck that.

11014
06:43:21,550 --> 06:43:22,750
Okay, I need to focus.

11015
06:43:22,830 --> 06:43:23,930
How do you get revealed when I play Jeff?

11016
06:43:25,050 --> 06:43:25,470
Me.

11017
06:43:26,130 --> 06:43:26,550
I did.

11018
06:43:27,210 --> 06:43:28,870
Oh, they're on Captain America?

11019
06:43:30,350 --> 06:43:31,150
Oh, that's cringe.

11020
06:43:31,890 --> 06:43:32,290
What?

11021
06:43:33,110 --> 06:43:33,290
What?

11022
06:43:33,430 --> 06:43:33,790
No way.

11023
06:43:33,990 --> 06:43:35,030
Oh, my God.

11024
06:43:35,170 --> 06:43:35,490
No way.

11025
06:43:37,370 --> 06:43:38,270
Okay, dude.

11026
06:43:39,170 --> 06:43:40,610
You got this this time, buddy.

11027
06:43:40,690 --> 06:43:41,390
I'm almost back.

11028
06:43:42,410 --> 06:43:42,950
Round two.

11029
06:43:45,790 --> 06:43:46,810
Okay, this is bad.

11030
06:43:47,270 --> 06:43:47,970
Hey, calm down.

11031
06:43:48,410 --> 06:43:48,950
Watch this.

11032
06:43:49,070 --> 06:43:49,390
You ready, Drew?

11033
06:43:49,530 --> 06:43:49,910
I'm back.

11034
06:43:50,670 --> 06:43:51,410
I'm here with him.

11035
06:43:53,550 --> 06:43:54,430
Jesus Christ.

11036
06:43:56,430 --> 06:43:57,290
Oh, my God.

11037
06:43:57,610 --> 06:43:58,450
I'm trying my best.

11038
06:43:58,990 --> 06:43:59,810
I like the cold.

11039
06:44:00,070 --> 06:44:01,070
There's a cat, back here, cat.

11040
06:44:01,070 --> 06:44:01,690
I'm ready to put on a show.

11041
06:44:02,930 --> 06:44:04,970
I'm ready to put on a show.

11042
06:44:05,050 --> 06:44:05,830
Oh, no.

11043
06:44:05,830 --> 06:44:06,250
Oh, I didn't!

11044
06:44:06,510 --> 06:44:07,050
I'm locked that too.

11045
06:44:07,410 --> 06:44:07,510
I'm sorry.

11046
06:44:09,150 --> 06:44:10,030
No, no.

11047
06:44:10,390 --> 06:44:10,950
There you go.

11048
06:44:11,210 --> 06:44:11,810
I got it.

11049
06:44:12,330 --> 06:44:12,930
Oh my God.

11050
06:44:13,090 --> 06:44:13,490
Just got it.

11051
06:44:15,150 --> 06:44:16,210
Oh, no!

11052
06:44:17,070 --> 06:44:17,910
Fucking lost.

11053
06:44:18,110 --> 06:44:18,450
Holy shit.

11054
06:44:18,650 --> 06:44:19,530
I couldn't see!

11055
06:44:24,130 --> 06:44:25,710
I couldn't see!

11056
06:44:25,990 --> 06:44:27,730
The Lunar ult made it disappear!

11057
06:44:41,950 --> 06:44:45,390
I'm so broke and so ugly.

11058
06:44:45,690 --> 06:44:47,390
I'm so ugly.

11059
06:44:57,080 --> 06:44:58,720
There's my Wolverine.

11060
06:45:01,500 --> 06:45:02,500
Oh, there he is.

11061
06:45:02,660 --> 06:45:06,500
I was gonna say, what am I supposed to do this?

11062
06:45:08,880 --> 06:45:09,840
Oh, this is bad.

11063
06:45:09,960 --> 06:45:13,520
We don't have... I'm trying so hard.

11064
06:45:14,420 --> 06:45:15,340
I'm killing him.

11065
06:45:19,920 --> 06:45:23,620
Oh, this is not looking so good right now.

11066
06:45:24,720 --> 06:45:25,980
We might lose.

11067
06:45:26,400 --> 06:45:27,760
I might need his turn for his Iron Man.

11068
06:45:28,460 --> 06:45:29,180
Maximum Pulse!

11069
06:45:30,860 --> 06:45:31,220
I...

11070
06:45:31,220 --> 06:45:32,400
Wait, I didn't even see it though.

11071
06:45:33,500 --> 06:45:34,860
Wait, no, his Iron Man is too good.

11072
06:45:34,920 --> 06:45:35,920
His Iron Man is too good, bro.

11073
06:45:36,240 --> 06:45:36,520
Goddamn.

11074
06:45:36,940 --> 06:45:38,360
He actually got the angle on that shit.

11075
06:45:38,500 --> 06:45:39,100
I could do anything.

11076
06:45:41,060 --> 06:45:42,260
I have ult with an X though.

11077
06:45:42,400 --> 06:45:43,240
No, I have ult with an X.

11078
06:45:43,560 --> 06:45:44,040
Wait, wait.

11079
06:45:44,320 --> 06:45:46,120
He ulted at the end of the last fight.

11080
06:45:46,300 --> 06:45:46,900
Like, he's with ult.

11081
06:45:46,900 --> 06:45:48,800
Yeah, I mean... Hey, I don't know.

11082
06:45:49,120 --> 06:45:51,260
I'm sorry, I'm back at the end of the last fight.

11083
06:45:51,340 --> 06:45:53,180
Wait, my hat didn't even pop through, bro.

11084
06:45:54,600 --> 06:45:54,980
What?

11085
06:45:55,880 --> 06:45:57,020
I'm trying my best.

11086
06:45:58,160 --> 06:46:01,030
Ready to put on a shove!

11087
06:46:02,170 --> 06:46:03,810
I am ready to put on a shove!

11088
06:46:03,810 --> 06:46:04,110
Okay.

11089
06:46:05,030 --> 06:46:08,310
I'm trying my best, but they are free pushing.

11090
06:46:09,210 --> 06:46:18,250
I'm trying my best, but they are free pushing.

11091
06:46:19,550 --> 06:46:20,430
Wait, what?

11092
06:46:24,220 --> 06:46:25,980
Oh my... Oh, that's a get up.

11093
06:46:28,100 --> 06:46:29,420
I couldn't see them.

11094
06:46:30,280 --> 06:46:30,500
Big!

11095
06:46:30,920 --> 06:46:32,440
Thank you for the... Welcome to Jaminify!

11096
06:46:32,640 --> 06:46:33,240
Welcome, welcome!

11097
06:46:34,700 --> 06:46:35,560
Yeah, I can't see them.

11098
06:46:36,080 --> 06:46:37,360
Okay, he has a get up.

11099
06:46:40,420 --> 06:46:41,280
I have a game.

11100
06:46:45,800 --> 06:46:47,000
Yeah, there you go.

11101
06:46:47,300 --> 06:46:49,580
I have to, like, get up position for that, which was scary.

11102
06:46:51,900 --> 06:46:52,900
Oh, I love you.

11103
06:46:55,760 --> 06:46:56,480
He's imperious.

11104
06:46:58,920 --> 06:47:01,980
Oh my god.

11105
06:47:09,770 --> 06:47:10,410
There we go.

11106
06:47:10,650 --> 06:47:11,490
This character is so stupid.

11107
06:47:11,610 --> 06:47:13,770
I just grab them by the neck and push them with my legs.

11108
06:47:15,970 --> 06:47:16,590
Hell yeah!

11109
06:47:17,870 --> 06:47:21,230
I mean, I don't know what happened to me, but like, what the fuck is that actually?

11110
06:47:21,790 --> 06:47:25,030
Time to switch things up, including which side you're on.

11111
06:47:25,030 --> 06:47:26,390
Alright, we got this.

11112
06:47:26,510 --> 06:47:27,110
Should I go hitscan?

11113
06:47:27,210 --> 06:47:28,870
Do you guys want me to keep running down the capital again?

11114
06:47:29,470 --> 06:47:30,910
No, no, you stay so cool.

11115
06:47:32,230 --> 06:47:32,950
It's working.

11116
06:47:33,450 --> 06:47:34,050
It's working.

11117
06:47:34,170 --> 06:47:35,150
That's all that matters.

11118
06:47:35,670 --> 06:47:36,390
It's working.

11119
06:47:36,810 --> 06:47:37,450
I'm just playing the game of chicken, bro.

11120
06:47:37,550 --> 06:47:38,590
I'm just chasing the capital around.

11121
06:47:40,210 --> 06:47:41,190
Bro, was it any team?

11122
06:47:41,190 --> 06:47:41,970
I like chicken.

11123
06:47:43,070 --> 06:47:44,710
Neither of us was playing Groot at the end.

11124
06:47:44,830 --> 06:47:45,350
What the hell happened?

11125
06:47:46,930 --> 06:47:47,550
It's tragic.

11126
06:47:47,550 --> 06:47:48,690
Groot's not good.

11127
06:47:52,430 --> 06:47:53,810
Groot's not good.

11128
06:47:54,310 --> 06:47:55,090
That's crazy.

11129
06:47:56,470 --> 06:47:57,990
Poor craziest statement.

11130
06:47:59,810 --> 06:48:01,830
Can they stop adding counters to Wolverine though?

11131
06:48:02,410 --> 06:48:05,470
Every character they add is a counter to Wolverine.

11132
06:48:05,470 --> 06:48:06,290
I'm coming for you, okay?

11133
06:48:06,510 --> 06:48:07,630
No, no, motherfucker, no.

11134
06:48:07,950 --> 06:48:09,130
I'm coming just for you, buddy.

11135
06:48:09,590 --> 06:48:10,190
No, no, no.

11136
06:48:10,190 --> 06:48:12,130
How is the Venom team up even going to work for him?

11137
06:48:12,230 --> 06:48:13,150
How the fuck is that going to work?

11138
06:48:14,670 --> 06:48:15,310
For Jeff.

11139
06:48:16,350 --> 06:48:17,130
How's that going to work?

11140
06:48:17,270 --> 06:48:17,730
How's that team up going to work for him?

11141
06:48:17,730 --> 06:48:18,950
It's going to be on his old try.

11142
06:48:19,190 --> 06:48:20,410
It's going to make his old do more damage.

11143
06:48:21,850 --> 06:48:22,630
I'll have to assume.

11144
06:48:23,230 --> 06:48:23,830
It's like the .

11145
06:48:26,550 --> 06:48:27,910
Who's just not good, guys?

11146
06:48:28,190 --> 06:48:32,370
It could literally be the exact same thing, but it's like a Sybio's load of ice as well.

11147
06:48:34,310 --> 06:48:35,250
That'd be kind of a while though.

11148
06:48:35,310 --> 06:48:37,250
I hope they'd be good.

11149
06:48:38,790 --> 06:48:40,350
I don't want that.

11150
06:48:40,670 --> 06:48:41,110
I don't want that.

11151
06:48:41,110 --> 06:48:42,870
Everyone wants Jeff Buffer.

11152
06:48:43,370 --> 06:48:44,670
I don't want that.

11153
06:48:45,230 --> 06:48:46,090
Yes, you do, bro.

11154
06:48:46,250 --> 06:48:46,470
He does.

11155
06:48:46,990 --> 06:48:48,770
He's just going to get iframe running away in his old.

11156
06:48:49,790 --> 06:48:50,990
I don't want that.

11157
06:48:53,950 --> 06:48:54,650
They got off cap.

11158
06:48:54,810 --> 06:48:55,330
They're scared of me.

11159
06:48:56,850 --> 06:48:57,390
I'm scared of you.

11160
06:48:57,870 --> 06:48:58,650
He's up right here, right here.

11161
06:48:58,910 --> 06:48:59,410
Oh, look at that.

11162
06:48:59,550 --> 06:49:00,130
He just pulled me.

11163
06:49:00,930 --> 06:49:02,150
Yeah, wolf death gear, by the way.

11164
06:49:02,270 --> 06:49:02,830
Wolf death gear.

11165
06:49:04,510 --> 06:49:05,330
It's okay.

11166
06:49:05,510 --> 06:49:05,910
Oh, no.

11167
06:49:06,510 --> 06:49:08,070
It's pizza on Iron Fist.

11168
06:49:08,490 --> 06:49:09,690
Oh, no.

11169
06:49:10,250 --> 06:49:11,430
Oh, no.

11170
06:49:11,910 --> 06:49:12,170
Fear.

11171
06:49:13,070 --> 06:49:15,150
Pizza on Iron Fist is actual fear.

11172
06:49:15,770 --> 06:49:16,330
It is...

11173
06:49:21,710 --> 06:49:22,430
What?

11174
06:49:32,450 --> 06:49:34,570
Why does pizza play all the pedophile characters?

11175
06:49:38,950 --> 06:49:39,410
What?

11176
06:49:39,810 --> 06:49:41,070
He doesn't like Zios.

11177
06:49:41,350 --> 06:49:41,970
He does.

11178
06:49:42,070 --> 06:49:42,790
He doesn't like Zios.

11179
06:49:42,970 --> 06:49:43,630
I'm not bad.

11180
06:49:43,870 --> 06:49:45,490
They are in front of us.

11181
06:49:45,690 --> 06:49:46,050
Oh my god.

11182
06:49:46,130 --> 06:49:46,370
They're in front of us.

11183
06:49:46,370 --> 06:49:46,410
They're in heels.

11184
06:49:46,630 --> 06:49:46,910
I love you.

11185
06:49:47,450 --> 06:49:48,210
Oh my god.

11186
06:49:48,970 --> 06:49:50,130
Oh my god.

11187
06:49:50,130 --> 06:49:50,250
Oh my god.

11188
06:49:50,410 --> 06:49:50,650
Please.

11189
06:49:56,450 --> 06:49:57,410
Yeah, I think I'll play.

11190
06:50:00,860 --> 06:50:01,320
Okay.

11191
06:50:01,780 --> 06:50:03,020
This is very stressful.

11192
06:50:04,080 --> 06:50:05,800
This is very stressful, guys.

11193
06:50:09,200 --> 06:50:10,160
Very stressful.

11194
06:50:11,400 --> 06:50:11,880
Alright.

11195
06:50:12,100 --> 06:50:12,740
I am ready to put on a show.

11196
06:50:12,920 --> 06:50:14,820
I am ready to put on a show.

11197
06:50:17,280 --> 06:50:19,380
I am ready to put on a show.

11198
06:50:19,400 --> 06:50:19,600
Oh.

11199
06:50:19,780 --> 06:50:20,520
I might die though.

11200
06:50:22,880 --> 06:50:23,640
That's alright.

11201
06:50:24,440 --> 06:50:24,920
I...

11202
06:50:24,920 --> 06:50:26,920
It was the risk I was willing to take.

11203
06:50:26,920 --> 06:50:28,400
It was actually...

11204
06:50:28,400 --> 06:50:28,960
It was actually...

11205
06:50:28,960 --> 06:50:30,780
What else could I do?

11206
06:50:30,920 --> 06:50:31,380
Keep her now!

11207
06:50:31,980 --> 06:50:32,100
Keep her now!

11208
06:50:32,100 --> 06:50:32,580
Keep her now!

11209
06:50:32,580 --> 06:50:32,600
Keep her now!

11210
06:50:32,600 --> 06:50:33,000
What else?

11211
06:50:33,280 --> 06:50:35,200
I had to damage them.

11212
06:50:38,220 --> 06:50:39,560
I had to.

11213
06:50:44,670 --> 06:50:46,410
It's the risk I was...

11214
06:50:46,410 --> 06:50:47,090
had to take.

11215
06:50:52,770 --> 06:50:53,410
What?

11216
06:50:54,010 --> 06:50:54,650
What?

11217
06:50:58,950 --> 06:50:59,590
Uh...

11218
06:50:59,590 --> 06:51:00,950
The Hella might be cheating.

11219
06:51:01,350 --> 06:51:02,330
I don't know.

11220
06:51:03,250 --> 06:51:05,150
He just headshot me six times.

11221
06:51:07,030 --> 06:51:08,570
He might just be really good.

11222
06:51:08,770 --> 06:51:09,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11223
06:51:09,770 --> 06:51:10,350
He might just be good.

11224
06:51:10,930 --> 06:51:11,850
We got this.

11225
06:51:12,490 --> 06:51:13,110
We got Gomez.

11226
06:51:14,590 --> 06:51:15,870
We got sick Gomez.

11227
06:51:16,870 --> 06:51:17,530
And he's sick.

11228
06:51:18,390 --> 06:51:19,170
Who got 10 deaths?

11229
06:51:28,100 --> 06:51:29,060
Oh no.

11230
06:51:30,500 --> 06:51:32,820
Maybe we were not meant to win this.

11231
06:51:32,820 --> 06:51:32,860
Yes.

11232
06:51:34,660 --> 06:51:35,460
That's bad.

11233
06:51:35,460 --> 06:51:35,820
Yeah, we lost.

11234
06:51:36,740 --> 06:51:38,700
I can't believe it.

11235
06:51:40,000 --> 06:51:42,320
He's on, that's not fair!

11236
06:51:43,500 --> 06:51:44,740
He's on!

11237
06:51:46,780 --> 06:51:48,160
Not fair!

11238
06:51:49,220 --> 06:51:50,480
He's on it!

11239
06:51:50,700 --> 06:51:51,060
Not fair!

11240
06:51:52,520 --> 06:51:53,580
Iron Fist!

11241
06:51:54,460 --> 06:51:55,680
Oh, I thought I was not shooting.

11242
06:51:55,760 --> 06:51:56,540
Shoot some booboo.

11243
06:51:57,120 --> 06:51:58,600
Okay, I'm trying to just shoot on me then.

11244
06:52:02,960 --> 06:52:04,200
Wait, what about three supports?

11245
06:52:07,440 --> 06:52:08,180
I'm not getting healed.

11246
06:52:11,120 --> 06:52:13,760
Oh, our boards are dying to a fist.

11247
06:52:15,660 --> 06:52:17,160
I've actually used the game, it's crazy.

11248
06:52:18,100 --> 06:52:18,960
Alright, it's not over yet.

11249
06:52:22,180 --> 06:52:24,080
Whoa, okay, I can heal that.

11250
06:52:27,440 --> 06:52:28,700
Yeah, you can always surrender.

11251
06:52:37,880 --> 06:52:39,260
I'm gonna freeze.

11252
06:52:44,600 --> 06:52:45,200
Alright.

11253
06:52:46,420 --> 06:52:47,440
Here we go.

11254
06:52:51,820 --> 06:52:52,420
Oh.

11255
06:52:56,360 --> 06:52:56,880
Whoa.

11256
06:52:58,020 --> 06:52:58,940
I'm dead anyway.

11257
06:53:01,920 --> 06:53:03,000
Oh my god.

11258
06:53:03,240 --> 06:53:04,400
I'm dead anyway.

11259
06:53:04,580 --> 06:53:06,040
There's a hell up behind us.

11260
06:53:11,610 --> 06:53:13,030
Oh, he got beat up.

11261
06:53:16,150 --> 06:53:17,310
No, it's just ranked.

11262
06:53:17,670 --> 06:53:18,550
We're ranking now.

11263
06:53:18,550 --> 06:53:21,130
I'm so ugly.

11264
06:53:21,870 --> 06:53:22,630
I'm so ugly.

11265
06:53:22,630 --> 06:53:23,110
Oh my god.

11266
06:53:24,010 --> 06:53:25,830
I'm so ugly.

11267
06:53:26,050 --> 06:53:26,210
I'm so ugly.

11268
06:53:26,610 --> 06:53:26,930
Two.

11269
06:53:27,030 --> 06:53:27,430
Two.

11270
06:53:30,850 --> 06:53:34,330
I can't believe pizza went fi- Iron fist!

11271
06:53:35,270 --> 06:53:38,750
You know he rarely ever plays Iron fist out?

11272
06:53:39,130 --> 06:53:39,930
Oh my god.

11273
06:53:45,720 --> 06:53:47,120
That's why I was surprised.

11274
06:53:47,240 --> 06:53:47,280
That's why I was surprised.

11275
06:53:50,590 --> 06:53:52,650
No, I think Gomez might be mad.

11276
06:53:52,810 --> 06:53:55,150
Because he had a really rough session with pizza.

11277
06:53:55,650 --> 06:53:56,170
Apparently.

11278
06:54:06,330 --> 06:54:07,650
No, you don't understand.

11279
06:54:07,650 --> 06:54:11,050
He mains Iron Man, but he doesn't play it that much.

11280
06:54:11,370 --> 06:54:12,930
He doesn't play it that much.

11281
06:54:15,370 --> 06:54:18,150
It's actually really rare to see him on Iron Man now.

11282
06:54:19,830 --> 06:54:20,230
Zen!

11283
06:54:20,490 --> 06:54:21,450
Welcome to Tomato Farm!

11284
06:54:21,650 --> 06:54:22,290
Welcome, welcome!

11285
06:54:22,950 --> 06:54:25,010
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

11286
06:54:25,930 --> 06:54:27,990
That's why I was like, I can't believe it.

11287
06:54:27,990 --> 06:54:29,450
Hey, Mr. Gomez again.

11288
06:54:30,310 --> 06:54:31,410
Oh, it isn't you.

11289
06:54:31,670 --> 06:54:32,210
It's like Iron fist.

11290
06:54:32,570 --> 06:54:32,850
Iron fist.

11291
06:54:32,970 --> 06:54:33,790
I'm gonna use the bathroom too.

11292
06:54:34,110 --> 06:54:35,410
I mean, it'll take a while, Ben.

11293
06:54:36,570 --> 06:54:37,510
Close enough, yeah.

11294
06:54:38,750 --> 06:54:41,050
Now, who am I gonna vanish from this match?

11295
06:54:41,070 --> 06:54:42,370
I don't know, I think your mic heard up for me.

11296
06:54:44,290 --> 06:54:47,390
No, it's because my mic is dog shit in game.

11297
06:54:48,210 --> 06:54:48,850
Oh, okay.

11298
06:54:48,890 --> 06:54:49,470
I don't know why it's so quiet.

11299
06:54:50,230 --> 06:54:51,070
That's tragic, man.

11300
06:54:56,740 --> 06:54:57,520
I just said, uh...

11301
06:54:58,200 --> 06:54:59,280
I don't even know how you say it.

11302
06:54:59,320 --> 06:55:00,180
Actually, now I think about it.

11303
06:55:01,380 --> 06:55:02,180
Now you got it.

11304
06:55:02,760 --> 06:55:03,240
I did?

11305
06:55:03,400 --> 06:55:03,880
Alright, perfect.

11306
06:55:04,860 --> 06:55:05,380
Yeah, I think...

11307
06:55:05,380 --> 06:55:06,300
I'm assuming you got it.

11308
06:55:06,360 --> 06:55:07,220
I just couldn't hear you that well.

11309
06:55:08,640 --> 06:55:09,040
That's true.

11310
06:55:09,120 --> 06:55:10,940
Let's get rid of Psylocke, because that character sucks.

11311
06:55:11,700 --> 06:55:12,140
I agree.

11312
06:55:12,740 --> 06:55:14,120
That character is fucking stupid.

11313
06:55:14,820 --> 06:55:15,940
Don't you play that character, Ben?

11314
06:55:17,300 --> 06:55:17,940
Yeah, but...

11315
06:55:17,940 --> 06:55:19,260
Everyone in their life plays the character.

11316
06:55:19,560 --> 06:55:21,240
And, you know, the character is kind of OP.

11317
06:55:22,260 --> 06:55:23,160
Oh, we have the Spider-Man.

11318
06:55:23,160 --> 06:55:23,700
I don't touch that thing.

11319
06:55:23,760 --> 06:55:25,020
Spider-Man gets to do whatever he wants.

11320
06:55:25,180 --> 06:55:27,060
If Psylocke's gone, you know, it's kind of cool.

11321
06:55:28,200 --> 06:55:28,900
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

11322
06:55:29,900 --> 06:55:31,040
It's kind of like...

11323
06:55:31,760 --> 06:55:33,960
Kind of like that, like, whole thing about the game.

11324
06:55:34,620 --> 06:55:35,900
And we got the best...

11325
06:55:35,900 --> 06:55:37,660
The best Hulk right here.

11326
06:55:37,980 --> 06:55:38,840
Mr. Potliver.

11327
06:55:39,200 --> 06:55:39,860
Pick your hero.

11328
06:55:40,140 --> 06:55:40,920
Or villain.

11329
06:55:40,960 --> 06:55:41,740
I'm not judging.

11330
06:55:42,460 --> 06:55:43,580
I got you, babe.

11331
06:55:43,580 --> 06:55:44,360
Hey, Mike.

11332
06:55:44,520 --> 06:55:45,500
Thank you for the super chat.

11333
06:55:45,700 --> 06:55:45,880
Thank you.

11334
06:55:45,980 --> 06:55:46,500
Thank you.

11335
06:55:46,780 --> 06:55:47,680
I mean, I don't want to.

11336
06:55:48,420 --> 06:55:49,720
Anything for Mr. Gomez.

11337
06:55:50,540 --> 06:55:50,680
All right.

11338
06:55:50,800 --> 06:55:51,020
Fuck it.

11339
06:55:52,960 --> 06:55:53,540
Fuck it.

11340
06:55:54,440 --> 06:55:54,740
All right.

11341
06:55:54,920 --> 06:55:55,100
All right.

11342
06:55:55,860 --> 06:55:56,260
Uh...

11343
06:55:56,260 --> 06:55:57,780
Call me on Rocket or...

11344
06:55:57,780 --> 06:55:58,900
A less good Loki.

11345
06:56:00,060 --> 06:56:01,480
Oh, you can do either one.

11346
06:56:02,420 --> 06:56:02,840
I'm back.

11347
06:56:03,360 --> 06:56:05,640
I just realized I'm not eating anything today.

11348
06:56:05,800 --> 06:56:06,200
It's good when he's here.

11349
06:56:06,420 --> 06:56:07,220
I'm not hungry.

11350
06:56:07,220 --> 06:56:07,960
I think I...

11351
06:56:07,960 --> 06:56:09,060
I think I ate...

11352
06:56:09,060 --> 06:56:10,360
I ate a really bad Subway.

11353
06:56:10,580 --> 06:56:11,240
Last two days.

11354
06:56:11,420 --> 06:56:13,040
So my stomach has been, like, really weird.

11355
06:56:15,680 --> 06:56:16,760
I'm not hungry!

11356
06:56:18,460 --> 06:56:19,960
I actually don't feel hungry at all.

11357
06:56:20,180 --> 06:56:21,300
By the way, did Necros win?

11358
06:56:22,620 --> 06:56:23,480
Did they win?

11359
06:56:23,780 --> 06:56:24,420
Who would have thought?

11360
06:56:24,420 --> 06:56:25,320
Get ready!

11361
06:56:28,020 --> 06:56:29,520
Heart Lover, you want to go a main paint?

11362
06:56:30,460 --> 06:56:30,780
Yeah?

11363
06:56:32,520 --> 06:56:33,600
Okay, I'm not surprised.

11364
06:56:34,780 --> 06:56:35,280
Okay, okay.

11365
06:56:35,560 --> 06:56:36,800
No, I had a really...

11366
06:56:36,800 --> 06:56:37,320
Well, I don't know.

11367
06:56:37,400 --> 06:56:38,320
I think it was the Subway.

11368
06:56:38,420 --> 06:56:39,420
Because after the Subway...

11369
06:56:41,140 --> 06:56:41,460
Um...

11370
06:56:41,460 --> 06:56:42,720
After the Subway...

11371
06:56:43,760 --> 06:56:44,080
Um...

11372
06:56:44,080 --> 06:56:45,360
I haven't been feeling good.

11373
06:56:46,100 --> 06:56:46,460
Okay, okay.

11374
06:56:46,860 --> 06:56:47,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11375
06:56:47,600 --> 06:56:48,260
So, like...

11376
06:56:48,260 --> 06:56:50,240
But, like, it wasn't, like, food points or anything.

11377
06:56:50,320 --> 06:56:51,600
My stomach just felt weird.

11378
06:56:51,920 --> 06:56:52,600
Okay, I see you.

11379
06:56:52,800 --> 06:56:53,520
Oh, I'm fucking home.

11380
06:56:54,420 --> 06:56:55,420
No, it was before.

11381
06:56:55,680 --> 06:56:58,360
Like, even when I had the lasagna, my stomach felt weird, too.

11382
06:56:59,880 --> 06:57:00,880
I did, I had Pepto.

11383
06:57:01,440 --> 06:57:02,600
But it's not, like...

11384
06:57:02,600 --> 06:57:03,360
I wasn't, like...

11385
06:57:03,360 --> 06:57:04,920
I don't know, I don't know what it was.

11386
06:57:05,160 --> 06:57:06,000
I think that's why I'm not...

11387
06:57:06,000 --> 06:57:06,320
I feel...

11388
06:57:06,320 --> 06:57:09,640
Because I heard that whenever you have, like, weird food...

11389
06:57:09,640 --> 06:57:10,720
Oh, wait, they're over here.

11390
06:57:11,420 --> 06:57:13,860
Like, when you have weird food issues...

11391
06:57:13,860 --> 06:57:14,980
Like, issues...

11392
06:57:16,460 --> 06:57:17,960
Wait, where's my team?

11393
06:57:21,320 --> 06:57:21,680
Oh.

11394
06:57:21,680 --> 06:57:22,200
Oh.

11395
06:57:23,180 --> 06:57:23,600
Oh.

11396
06:57:23,900 --> 06:57:24,100
Oh.

11397
06:57:24,140 --> 06:57:24,560
Okay.

11398
06:57:25,220 --> 06:57:26,440
I was so confused.

11399
06:57:26,740 --> 06:57:27,680
I was like, where's my mag?

11400
06:57:28,320 --> 06:57:28,860
He's back.

11401
06:57:29,120 --> 06:57:29,580
Okay, you see...

11402
06:57:29,580 --> 06:57:31,140
I fell asleep in Q.

11403
06:57:31,280 --> 06:57:32,140
I fell asleep in Q.

11404
06:57:32,600 --> 06:57:33,040
I fell asleep in Q.

11405
06:57:33,560 --> 06:57:34,640
Wait, I think that's pizza.

11406
06:57:40,660 --> 06:57:41,180
Okay.

11407
06:57:46,350 --> 06:57:47,050
Not bad.

11408
06:57:49,210 --> 06:57:49,450
Yeah.

11409
06:57:53,410 --> 06:57:54,490
I missed that.

11410
06:57:54,670 --> 06:57:56,410
He dashed when I didn't think he was gonna dash.

11411
06:57:56,410 --> 06:57:57,090
Yeah.

11412
06:57:57,370 --> 06:57:59,630
Thor Emma might be the least diveable thing ever.

11413
06:58:00,090 --> 06:58:00,610
Yup.

11414
06:58:02,070 --> 06:58:02,850
Let me know.

11415
06:58:04,090 --> 06:58:04,970
Then you know.

11416
06:58:05,110 --> 06:58:05,650
Then you know.

11417
06:58:06,450 --> 06:58:06,810
Let me know.

11418
06:58:08,570 --> 06:58:09,090
Alright.

11419
06:58:09,390 --> 06:58:09,990
Iron man.

11420
06:58:10,370 --> 06:58:12,070
I had turkey breast for my...

11421
06:58:12,070 --> 06:58:12,530
There's no good.

11422
06:58:17,900 --> 06:58:20,520
Oh, he's so low!

11423
06:58:20,960 --> 06:58:22,460
He's so low....

11424
06:58:22,460 --> 06:58:25,320
He's so low...!

11425
06:58:26,520 --> 06:58:27,520
Oh,

11426
06:58:30,840 --> 06:58:34,760
I realize I don't have...

11427
06:58:36,260 --> 06:58:38,240
Oh, that's unlucky for me.

11428
06:58:43,920 --> 06:58:45,640
That was unlucky for me.

11429
06:58:45,740 --> 06:58:47,280
I was stuck in the weirdest area.

11430
06:58:49,480 --> 06:58:50,420
Alright, nice!

11431
06:58:53,320 --> 06:58:53,860
Yeah!

11432
06:58:55,820 --> 06:58:57,480
Yeah, we definitely didn't need it.

11433
06:58:57,980 --> 06:58:59,240
I got worried.

11434
06:59:04,760 --> 06:59:05,720
Yeah, they're lucky.

11435
06:59:05,860 --> 06:59:06,780
They're a maggot by now.

11436
06:59:11,630 --> 06:59:15,430
I don't know why, but Thor is like the one character I can't predict very well.

11437
06:59:15,750 --> 06:59:18,450
When it comes to like... freezing.

11438
06:59:21,430 --> 06:59:22,250
Oh my god.

11439
06:59:22,970 --> 06:59:29,860
I don't know why.

11440
06:59:31,040 --> 06:59:32,780
There's just something about...

11441
06:59:34,860 --> 06:59:35,800
I got a little ult.

11442
06:59:35,800 --> 06:59:36,760
Okay, I got a little ult.

11443
06:59:40,060 --> 06:59:40,380
Nice.

11444
06:59:42,540 --> 06:59:43,020
I'm down,

11445
06:59:46,660 --> 06:59:49,040
I'm down, I'm down.

11446
06:59:49,360 --> 06:59:50,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had to crash a little.

11447
06:59:50,640 --> 06:59:51,060
I had to crash a little.

11448
06:59:52,700 --> 06:59:53,960
Just let the, just let the crash a little.

11449
06:59:54,120 --> 06:59:54,600
I'm gonna chase.

11450
06:59:55,620 --> 06:59:55,940
Oh,

11451
07:00:00,020 --> 07:00:00,820
he almost got a...

11452
07:00:04,690 --> 07:00:05,770
Like, I had to...

11453
07:00:06,430 --> 07:00:07,130
walk around.

11454
07:00:07,430 --> 07:00:08,210
Oh, it's not pizza.

11455
07:00:08,550 --> 07:00:09,570
I saw like...

11456
07:00:09,570 --> 07:00:09,810
Iron and...

11457
07:00:13,310 --> 07:00:15,050
Yeah, Emma, can you just 1v1 there, Emma?

11458
07:00:15,170 --> 07:00:15,310
Okay.

11459
07:00:16,230 --> 07:00:16,630
Okay.

11460
07:00:17,170 --> 07:00:18,030
He's walking on my back.

11461
07:00:19,650 --> 07:00:20,050
Oh!

11462
07:00:21,250 --> 07:00:23,310
I keep forgetting I don't have an Iron Man...

11463
07:00:23,310 --> 07:00:24,190
Iron Fist anymore.

11464
07:00:24,330 --> 07:00:25,390
So I kept trying to see.

11465
07:00:31,820 --> 07:00:32,560
That's unlucky.

11466
07:00:33,240 --> 07:00:35,320
I need to give that to the Spider-Man.

11467
07:00:42,870 --> 07:00:48,630
Oh my god, he's so fast that I can't...

11468
07:00:55,660 --> 07:00:59,800
I can do that before I lost.

11469
07:00:59,800 --> 07:00:59,900
I have to do that before I lost.

11470
07:01:01,040 --> 07:01:01,840
Oh, okay!

11471
07:01:01,960 --> 07:01:02,700
I don't have shields!

11472
07:01:03,080 --> 07:01:03,620
That's...

11473
07:01:05,480 --> 07:01:06,200
I'm okay.

11474
07:01:17,200 --> 07:01:18,560
I'm like...

11475
07:01:18,560 --> 07:01:18,960
I have...

11476
07:01:18,960 --> 07:01:19,760
I'm so sad.

11477
07:01:20,580 --> 07:01:21,260
He...

11478
07:01:21,260 --> 07:01:22,260
I...

11479
07:01:22,260 --> 07:01:22,760
He...

11480
07:01:22,760 --> 07:01:24,360
Did you see that he ulted?

11481
07:01:27,040 --> 07:01:29,400
I got sad because like...

11482
07:01:29,400 --> 07:01:31,610
I was hoping I would get shielded.

11483
07:01:32,280 --> 07:01:33,630
But instead of getting shielded...

11484
07:01:34,240 --> 07:01:35,380
I got...

11485
07:01:35,380 --> 07:01:36,300
Ulted.

11486
07:01:36,520 --> 07:01:37,140
Instead...

11487
07:01:37,140 --> 07:01:38,160
High point, high point, high point.

11488
07:01:41,270 --> 07:01:42,490
I got...

11489
07:01:42,490 --> 07:01:43,490
I got...

11490
07:01:43,490 --> 07:01:44,270
I was like...

11491
07:01:44,270 --> 07:01:46,270
My mag shall shield me!

11492
07:01:47,530 --> 07:01:48,250
And then...

11493
07:01:49,290 --> 07:01:50,010
And then...

11494
07:01:50,010 --> 07:01:50,250
Then he...

11495
07:01:50,250 --> 07:01:51,350
He ulted.

11496
07:01:52,150 --> 07:01:52,510
Alright.

11497
07:01:52,710 --> 07:01:53,070
Close.

11498
07:01:54,370 --> 07:01:55,110
I can go...

11499
07:01:55,110 --> 07:01:56,010
I can just go the...

11500
07:01:56,010 --> 07:01:56,810
I can go the Loki.

11501
07:01:57,950 --> 07:01:59,610
Bro, what are you talking about, Kujo?

11502
07:01:59,750 --> 07:02:00,350
What's wrong, man?

11503
07:02:01,070 --> 07:02:01,430
No, no.

11504
07:02:01,470 --> 07:02:02,470
Cause I know you can play VPS.

11505
07:02:02,650 --> 07:02:03,530
So I can just do the Loki.

11506
07:02:03,890 --> 07:02:04,090
Yeah.

11507
07:02:04,310 --> 07:02:04,450
Nah.

11508
07:02:04,610 --> 07:02:05,490
I'm in the guy in chat.

11509
07:02:06,570 --> 07:02:06,790
Oh.

11510
07:02:08,770 --> 07:02:09,130
Alright.

11511
07:02:13,510 --> 07:02:14,050
Uh...

11512
07:02:14,050 --> 07:02:15,010
I got you.

11513
07:02:15,190 --> 07:02:16,110
Just for you, Gomez.

11514
07:02:16,470 --> 07:02:17,150
This one's for you.

11515
07:02:18,030 --> 07:02:18,570
Wait.

11516
07:02:18,910 --> 07:02:19,830
Where's our...

11517
07:02:19,830 --> 07:02:20,590
Spider-Man?

11518
07:02:22,170 --> 07:02:23,470
Where's our Spider-Man?

11519
07:02:27,490 --> 07:02:28,790
Where's our Spider-Man?

11520
07:02:39,670 --> 07:02:40,770
Where did he go?

11521
07:02:40,770 --> 07:02:42,230
Where did he go?

11522
07:02:42,610 --> 07:02:43,710
There he is.

11523
07:02:44,490 --> 07:02:46,550
I couldn't find our Spider-Man.

11524
07:02:47,490 --> 07:02:48,350
Iron Man?

11525
07:02:48,850 --> 07:02:49,050
Alright.

11526
07:02:49,250 --> 07:02:49,590
Nah.

11527
07:02:50,490 --> 07:02:51,630
I'm a lucky player, bro.

11528
07:02:52,110 --> 07:02:53,530
I never chose to be Iron Man.

11529
07:02:58,690 --> 07:03:00,550
I just wanna learn more characters.

11530
07:03:01,510 --> 07:03:02,310
I do.

11531
07:03:03,130 --> 07:03:03,590
Oh.

11532
07:03:04,950 --> 07:03:06,110
Yay, he is.

11533
07:03:10,590 --> 07:03:11,930
Yay, he is.

11534
07:03:14,070 --> 07:03:15,410
Yay, he is.

11535
07:03:15,710 --> 07:03:16,450
I'm a lucky.

11536
07:03:18,790 --> 07:03:20,070
Looks like a missionary.

11537
07:03:20,070 --> 07:03:20,910
Looks like a missionary.

11538
07:03:22,170 --> 07:03:22,390
Yeah.

11539
07:03:26,230 --> 07:03:27,770
Might be a stubborn angle, actually.

11540
07:03:27,910 --> 07:03:28,150
My bad.

11541
07:03:31,510 --> 07:03:32,530
Oh my god.

11542
07:03:35,210 --> 07:03:36,090
Let's actually...

11543
07:03:36,090 --> 07:03:37,110
Yo, Gomez, I got a question, man.

11544
07:03:37,130 --> 07:03:38,090
How many characters did you put?

11545
07:03:38,450 --> 07:03:38,790
Like...

11546
07:03:39,310 --> 07:03:40,530
I have to focus.

11547
07:03:40,790 --> 07:03:41,210
Sorry, guys.

11548
07:03:41,410 --> 07:03:42,610
Yay, he is.

11549
07:03:44,750 --> 07:03:46,230
Yay, he is.

11550
07:03:47,170 --> 07:03:47,830
Yay, he is.

11551
07:03:48,730 --> 07:03:49,910
Oh my god.

11552
07:03:50,310 --> 07:03:50,650
Yay.

11553
07:03:51,190 --> 07:03:52,270
I need his.

11554
07:03:53,310 --> 07:03:54,110
I'll purse.

11555
07:03:54,350 --> 07:03:54,470
I'll purse.

11556
07:03:56,670 --> 07:03:57,370
I'll purse.

11557
07:03:58,090 --> 07:03:59,330
Never mind, never mind.

11558
07:04:00,750 --> 07:04:01,850
I have no grinch.

11559
07:04:05,600 --> 07:04:06,120
Okay.

11560
07:04:08,580 --> 07:04:09,860
I'm not gonna let him.

11561
07:04:10,200 --> 07:04:10,600
No!

11562
07:04:10,780 --> 07:04:11,140
What?

11563
07:04:11,520 --> 07:04:11,960
What?

11564
07:04:12,500 --> 07:04:13,360
Oh my god!

11565
07:04:14,540 --> 07:04:15,400
Oh my god.

11566
07:04:15,660 --> 07:04:16,740
I was so scared.

11567
07:04:16,960 --> 07:04:18,320
I was like, I'll hide.

11568
07:04:18,900 --> 07:04:21,260
And then he showed up next to me.

11569
07:04:23,260 --> 07:04:23,940
That...

11570
07:04:23,940 --> 07:04:24,720
That...

11571
07:04:25,520 --> 07:04:26,200
I...

11572
07:04:26,940 --> 07:04:27,620
Was...

11573
07:04:28,100 --> 07:04:29,420
Not expecting that.

11574
07:04:29,920 --> 07:04:30,440
I...

11575
07:04:30,440 --> 07:04:32,980
Did not know why he was there.

11576
07:04:36,380 --> 07:04:37,700
That was...

11577
07:04:38,260 --> 07:04:39,740
There was so much fear.

11578
07:04:40,080 --> 07:04:42,080
There was actually so much fear.

11579
07:04:42,480 --> 07:04:43,100
That...

11580
07:04:43,840 --> 07:04:44,520
I...

11581
07:04:45,260 --> 07:04:46,500
I was so sad.

11582
07:04:46,720 --> 07:04:47,500
And then I...

11583
07:04:47,500 --> 07:04:49,380
And then I was so happy that I live.

11584
07:04:49,380 --> 07:04:49,900
I...

11585
07:04:52,200 --> 07:04:52,680
I...

11586
07:04:52,680 --> 07:04:52,740
I...

11587
07:04:52,740 --> 07:04:52,900
I...

11588
07:04:53,880 --> 07:04:54,360
I...

11589
07:04:54,360 --> 07:04:55,380
Like, just actually slugged.

11590
07:04:55,460 --> 07:04:56,460
Because you were spamming hills.

11591
07:04:56,640 --> 07:04:56,920
And...

11592
07:04:56,920 --> 07:04:58,160
But my left ear is infected.

11593
07:04:58,620 --> 07:04:59,500
So I can't hear out of there.

11594
07:05:00,020 --> 07:05:01,120
Oh my god.

11595
07:05:01,140 --> 07:05:02,400
You're like Gasclin.

11596
07:05:03,300 --> 07:05:04,140
I can't...

11597
07:05:04,140 --> 07:05:05,820
I can't hear shit through my left ear right now.

11598
07:05:06,760 --> 07:05:07,240
Damn.

11599
07:05:07,240 --> 07:05:08,260
Damn, what the fuck?

11600
07:05:08,600 --> 07:05:09,800
I survived two ults.

11601
07:05:09,960 --> 07:05:10,220
I...

11602
07:05:10,220 --> 07:05:11,460
I don't know how.

11603
07:05:11,620 --> 07:05:14,080
I don't know how I survived two ults there.

11604
07:05:15,300 --> 07:05:15,780
I...

11605
07:05:15,780 --> 07:05:16,440
I...

11606
07:05:16,440 --> 07:05:17,360
I don't know how.

11607
07:05:18,360 --> 07:05:18,840
I...

11608
07:05:18,840 --> 07:05:19,140
Dude.

11609
07:05:19,420 --> 07:05:20,020
Dude.

11610
07:05:21,220 --> 07:05:24,080
That was actually crazy that that worked.

11611
07:05:24,440 --> 07:05:24,820
I...

11612
07:05:30,810 --> 07:05:32,570
Like, that should not have worked.

11613
07:05:33,490 --> 07:05:36,550
Like, the fact that the Ironman did not see me there.

11614
07:05:36,890 --> 07:05:37,030
Yeah.

11615
07:05:38,710 --> 07:05:41,510
The Ironman actually did not see me.

11616
07:05:41,670 --> 07:05:42,530
Thank fucking god.

11617
07:05:43,690 --> 07:05:44,650
All skill.

11618
07:05:45,030 --> 07:05:45,690
All skill.

11619
07:05:45,870 --> 07:05:46,170
Okay, okay.

11620
07:05:47,590 --> 07:05:48,990
Hey, we'll swap the support, man.

11621
07:05:51,330 --> 07:05:52,390
I thought the game was over, bro.

11622
07:05:52,470 --> 07:05:52,990
I tapped out.

11623
07:05:53,650 --> 07:05:55,230
I got motivated by cart lover.

11624
07:05:55,750 --> 07:05:56,490
Go back to sleep.

11625
07:05:56,850 --> 07:05:57,730
He fucking popped off.

11626
07:05:57,930 --> 07:05:58,950
I fell asleep in queue.

11627
07:05:59,350 --> 07:06:00,390
Go back to bed, man.

11628
07:06:00,910 --> 07:06:01,990
Heroes make them safe.

11629
07:06:02,870 --> 07:06:07,170
I think cart might have been doom queuing for a while.

11630
07:06:10,250 --> 07:06:10,810
Yeah.

11631
07:06:10,970 --> 07:06:11,010
Yeah.

11632
07:06:11,010 --> 07:06:11,430
Thank god.

11633
07:06:11,650 --> 07:06:16,190
Thank god he saw the other Luna and was like, the nasty me.

11634
07:06:16,530 --> 07:06:17,050
The green one.

11635
07:06:17,230 --> 07:06:17,630
The green one.

11636
07:06:18,690 --> 07:06:19,790
Okay, bitchy bitch.

11637
07:06:20,690 --> 07:06:20,830
What?

11638
07:06:20,830 --> 07:06:22,730
Yeah, well, it was...

11639
07:06:22,730 --> 07:06:22,790
It was...

11640
07:06:22,790 --> 07:06:23,710
Growing up, I...

11641
07:06:23,710 --> 07:06:25,030
The red ranger was always fine.

11642
07:06:25,270 --> 07:06:26,610
Oh, my god, you so cool.

11643
07:06:26,890 --> 07:06:27,190
Yeah.

11644
07:06:27,750 --> 07:06:28,430
Growing up...

11645
07:06:28,430 --> 07:06:29,470
Now, I'm like holy shit.

11646
07:06:29,610 --> 07:06:30,050
You're the fucker.

11647
07:06:30,910 --> 07:06:32,090
Like, I didn't realize that.

11648
07:06:32,210 --> 07:06:33,210
All right, here we go.

11649
07:06:33,370 --> 07:06:34,230
We can win this.

11650
07:06:36,330 --> 07:06:37,130
I think...

11651
07:06:37,130 --> 07:06:39,750
Guys, all I'm saying is if I...

11652
07:06:41,110 --> 07:06:43,670
If I keep playing, I might be able to get top 500 today.

11653
07:06:44,070 --> 07:06:44,170
All right.

11654
07:06:49,310 --> 07:06:50,950
It's Celestia 1, right?

11655
07:06:51,250 --> 07:06:52,210
I know.

11656
07:06:53,230 --> 07:06:55,130
Guys, I could get top 500 on stream.

11657
07:06:55,290 --> 07:06:56,050
Wouldn't that be cool?

11658
07:06:57,470 --> 07:06:59,030
Wouldn't that be cool, though?

11659
07:07:01,190 --> 07:07:02,710
That would be pretty neat.

11660
07:07:03,050 --> 07:07:03,310
Aww.

11661
07:07:05,670 --> 07:07:06,190
Aww.

11662
07:07:07,410 --> 07:07:08,010
Never mind.

11663
07:07:08,210 --> 07:07:09,090
I've lost.

11664
07:07:09,470 --> 07:07:09,790
Oh, wait.

11665
07:07:09,850 --> 07:07:10,150
Unless?

11666
07:07:17,710 --> 07:07:19,250
That was unfortunate.

11667
07:07:23,590 --> 07:07:29,930
I swear to God, if I die... I swear to God, if I die... What?

11668
07:07:36,990 --> 07:07:38,310
I don't think we need that.

11669
07:07:38,370 --> 07:07:39,350
I can't see him, guys.

11670
07:07:40,390 --> 07:07:41,170
Oh, fuck.

11671
07:07:41,370 --> 07:07:41,650
Okay.

11672
07:07:42,390 --> 07:07:42,870
Yeah.

11673
07:07:42,870 --> 07:07:43,550
No, that's a good one.

11674
07:07:45,150 --> 07:07:45,150
Yeah.

11675
07:07:47,270 --> 07:07:49,130
That's unlucky I had to use that.

11676
07:07:50,130 --> 07:07:51,230
That's a Chime bolt right there.

11677
07:07:52,090 --> 07:07:53,230
Time to celebrate.

11678
07:07:54,030 --> 07:07:54,950
Is that a Chime bolt?

11679
07:07:55,870 --> 07:07:56,570
Deployer Chime?

11680
07:07:57,070 --> 07:07:57,230
Yeah.

11681
07:07:57,230 --> 07:07:57,870
I love Chime.

11682
07:07:58,090 --> 07:07:59,090
Watch your fucking mouth.

11683
07:07:59,990 --> 07:08:00,630
Yeah, no bad.

11684
07:08:01,410 --> 07:08:03,630
No, I haven't heard that in a while.

11685
07:08:03,890 --> 07:08:05,470
Who the fuck is... OH MY GOD!

11686
07:08:06,350 --> 07:08:07,130
Venom, Venom, Venom.

11687
07:08:09,250 --> 07:08:09,670
Okay.

11688
07:08:10,670 --> 07:08:12,190
That scared the shit out of me.

11689
07:08:12,190 --> 07:08:13,490
I was not ready for that.

11690
07:08:18,370 --> 07:08:23,210
I wish I could see my Spider-Man so I can give him a little... I love you, Venom.

11691
07:08:24,150 --> 07:08:24,930
I love you, Venom.

11692
07:08:24,930 --> 07:08:25,010
I love you too.

11693
07:08:25,250 --> 07:08:27,310
I love your cat more, though, but I hate to visit you.

11694
07:08:28,190 --> 07:08:28,430
What?

11695
07:08:28,910 --> 07:08:31,030
I love your cat more, no matter how bad he is.

11696
07:08:31,250 --> 07:08:33,230
Oh, it's a... Is he okay?

11697
07:08:33,510 --> 07:08:34,270
Oh, aren't... Yep, he is.

11698
07:08:34,610 --> 07:08:35,390
Wait, what color are you?

11699
07:08:35,470 --> 07:08:36,150
What color are you?

11700
07:08:37,010 --> 07:08:38,410
Wait, that's Starlight 1.

11701
07:08:38,430 --> 07:08:38,830
Nice.

11702
07:08:40,970 --> 07:08:41,630
That's right.

11703
07:08:41,630 --> 07:08:41,670
Alright.

11704
07:08:43,030 --> 07:08:44,210
You don't escape me.

11705
07:08:44,410 --> 07:08:45,130
Yeah, the tournament's over.

11706
07:08:45,270 --> 07:08:45,890
I'm just playing rank.

11707
07:08:47,130 --> 07:08:47,950
Oh, what the hell?

11708
07:08:49,010 --> 07:08:50,110
Yeah, guess who won?

11709
07:08:50,490 --> 07:08:51,290
I got three of your pain.

11710
07:08:51,390 --> 07:08:51,930
One moment, please.

11711
07:08:52,730 --> 07:08:53,110
Necros.

11712
07:08:54,370 --> 07:08:54,850
One moment.

11713
07:08:55,670 --> 07:08:56,050
Okay.

11714
07:08:57,090 --> 07:08:58,350
I don't know what the hell happened.

11715
07:08:58,630 --> 07:09:00,130
I said, like, he'll attack it lost.

11716
07:09:00,730 --> 07:09:01,350
Okay, nice.

11717
07:09:09,160 --> 07:09:09,540
Alright.

11718
07:09:13,620 --> 07:09:14,440
He'll be fine.

11719
07:09:14,540 --> 07:09:15,180
He'll be fine.

11720
07:09:15,600 --> 07:09:17,780
I am ready to put on a show.

11721
07:09:17,860 --> 07:09:18,160
Nice.

11722
07:09:18,340 --> 07:09:18,980
See, I told you.

11723
07:09:19,060 --> 07:09:19,600
It'll be fine.

11724
07:09:19,880 --> 07:09:20,760
I knew it'll be fine.

11725
07:09:21,520 --> 07:09:21,960
Look at him.

11726
07:09:22,140 --> 07:09:23,740
He did not need...

11727
07:09:24,300 --> 07:09:25,060
I got the invis.

11728
07:09:26,220 --> 07:09:26,620
Oh.

11729
07:09:29,240 --> 07:09:29,760
It's fine.

11730
07:09:30,400 --> 07:09:30,820
It's fine.

11731
07:09:31,320 --> 07:09:32,460
I'm ready to do some damage.

11732
07:09:33,120 --> 07:09:33,500
I'm ready to do some damage.

11733
07:09:34,020 --> 07:09:35,000
I made a copy.

11734
07:09:35,740 --> 07:09:37,140
I found one of our critics.

11735
07:09:38,300 --> 07:09:40,140
My Luna is fucking chasing them.

11736
07:09:40,820 --> 07:09:41,400
Yeah, we need that.

11737
07:09:41,400 --> 07:09:41,620
AP.

11738
07:09:44,440 --> 07:09:45,240
Nice.

11739
07:09:45,700 --> 07:09:46,720
Oh my god!

11740
07:09:47,040 --> 07:09:47,280
What?

11741
07:09:48,180 --> 07:09:48,800
Wait!

11742
07:09:49,340 --> 07:09:50,100
Was it because...

11743
07:09:50,100 --> 07:09:50,360
Oh my god!

11744
07:09:50,480 --> 07:09:51,840
The Freeze got her!

11745
07:09:53,680 --> 07:09:55,720
Wait, that's actually great.

11746
07:09:56,460 --> 07:09:57,620
That's crazy.

11747
07:09:58,580 --> 07:10:00,720
The Freeze actually...

11748
07:10:01,560 --> 07:10:02,780
That's Freeze.

11749
07:10:03,560 --> 07:10:04,840
Ain't no way.

11750
07:10:05,140 --> 07:10:07,100
He's like, ain't no way.

11751
07:10:07,100 --> 07:10:08,700
I got...

11752
07:10:09,760 --> 07:10:10,360
I got...

11753
07:10:11,820 --> 07:10:12,360
That's...

11754
07:10:12,360 --> 07:10:12,700
That's...

11755
07:10:14,040 --> 07:10:16,440
I might be the best Loki ever.

11756
07:10:18,380 --> 07:10:20,760
That Freeze was fucking insane.

11757
07:10:21,920 --> 07:10:22,540
I thought GG, guys.

11758
07:10:22,580 --> 07:10:23,060
You guys are fun.

11759
07:10:24,000 --> 07:10:24,520
Yeah, yeah.

11760
07:10:24,660 --> 07:10:24,940
Wait, wait.

11761
07:10:24,960 --> 07:10:25,500
I need...

11762
07:10:25,500 --> 07:10:26,300
Okay.

11763
07:10:26,940 --> 07:10:28,580
I'm gonna look at the replay.

11764
07:10:29,060 --> 07:10:29,800
I need...

11765
07:10:31,960 --> 07:10:34,380
He couldn't float because she kicked...

11766
07:10:34,380 --> 07:10:36,440
She kicked the Strange?

11767
07:10:37,360 --> 07:10:38,160
And...

11768
07:10:38,160 --> 07:10:39,160
Uh...

11769
07:10:39,800 --> 07:10:42,140
She kicked the Strange and...

11770
07:10:42,140 --> 07:10:44,020
And then so he couldn't do the...

11771
07:10:44,020 --> 07:10:44,840
He couldn't fly.

11772
07:10:45,220 --> 07:10:46,000
Because I...

11773
07:10:46,000 --> 07:10:47,520
Because I froze him.

11774
07:10:48,520 --> 07:10:48,920
Okay.

11775
07:10:49,640 --> 07:10:50,440
Uh...

11776
07:10:50,440 --> 07:10:51,140
Alright.

11777
07:10:51,480 --> 07:10:51,980
Okay.

11778
07:10:52,420 --> 07:10:52,860
Replay.

11779
07:10:53,340 --> 07:10:55,020
I need to see this.

11780
07:10:55,200 --> 07:10:56,320
That's actually crazy.

11781
07:10:56,320 --> 07:10:58,240
I think that's why he was like, what the fuck?

11782
07:11:07,940 --> 07:11:08,580
Oh, wait.

11783
07:11:09,820 --> 07:11:10,300
It's...

11784
07:11:13,060 --> 07:11:13,540
Okay.

11785
07:11:13,580 --> 07:11:14,160
It was this.

11786
07:11:14,420 --> 07:11:15,140
Where was it?

11787
07:11:16,860 --> 07:11:17,580
It was here.

11788
07:11:17,640 --> 07:11:18,400
Yes, it was!

11789
07:11:18,680 --> 07:11:19,240
It was!

11790
07:11:19,500 --> 07:11:19,880
Okay.

11791
07:11:20,340 --> 07:11:20,580
Wait.

11792
07:11:20,580 --> 07:11:21,360
I need to see this.

11793
07:11:22,160 --> 07:11:22,420
Alright.

11794
07:11:23,100 --> 07:11:23,420
What did...

11795
07:11:23,420 --> 07:11:23,880
What happened?

11796
07:11:29,600 --> 07:11:30,560
That's crazy.

11797
07:11:31,200 --> 07:11:33,320
He must have been like, what the fuck?

11798
07:11:35,240 --> 07:11:36,660
Because he has the fly.

11799
07:11:39,360 --> 07:11:40,620
Oh my god.

11800
07:11:41,680 --> 07:11:42,540
Oh my god.

11801
07:11:42,700 --> 07:11:43,260
He couldn't.

11802
07:11:43,720 --> 07:11:43,980
Yeah.

11803
07:11:44,200 --> 07:11:45,040
I was like, wait, what...

11804
07:11:45,040 --> 07:11:46,080
Wait, did I hit that?

11805
07:11:46,220 --> 07:11:47,180
I was like, wait, I hit that?

11806
07:11:49,320 --> 07:11:50,200
That's crazy.

11807
07:11:51,940 --> 07:11:54,780
That's actually a crazy freeze that I did.

11808
07:11:55,200 --> 07:11:55,520
It isn't.

11809
07:11:56,420 --> 07:11:56,860
Well...

11810
07:11:56,860 --> 07:11:57,160
Yuki.

11811
07:11:58,140 --> 07:11:58,580
Kegari.

11812
07:11:58,860 --> 07:11:59,300
And...

11813
07:11:59,300 --> 07:12:00,200
Oh, and uh...

11814
07:12:00,200 --> 07:12:00,500
Uh...

11815
07:12:00,500 --> 07:12:01,220
Who's the other guy?

11816
07:12:01,580 --> 07:12:02,020
Dude.

11817
07:12:02,340 --> 07:12:02,800
Oh, fuck.

11818
07:12:03,320 --> 07:12:04,020
Like the moon.

11819
07:12:04,140 --> 07:12:05,000
Wait, it was both of you.

11820
07:12:05,040 --> 07:12:05,620
I shine in darkness.

11821
07:12:05,960 --> 07:12:06,020
It's okay.

11822
07:12:06,980 --> 07:12:07,480
No, no.

11823
07:12:07,520 --> 07:12:08,020
Oh, let's go.

11824
07:12:08,400 --> 07:12:08,880
You remembered me!

11825
07:12:09,340 --> 07:12:09,980
You remembered me!

11826
07:12:10,080 --> 07:12:10,620
You remembered me!

11827
07:12:11,220 --> 07:12:12,260
Not because I have my name.

11828
07:12:12,260 --> 07:12:13,100
I have my name.

11829
07:12:14,460 --> 07:12:15,920
Is that anyone but our Spider-Man?

11830
07:12:16,480 --> 07:12:17,140
I think so.

11831
07:12:17,820 --> 07:12:18,180
Yippee!

11832
07:12:18,180 --> 07:12:18,480
And number 2.

11833
07:12:18,620 --> 07:12:19,600
You play Spider-Man?

11834
07:12:20,520 --> 07:12:21,400
I-I got it.

11835
07:12:21,460 --> 07:12:21,800
I got it.

11836
07:12:21,800 --> 07:12:22,200
Maybe he is.

11837
07:12:22,740 --> 07:12:23,760
I would've been in Salo.

11838
07:12:26,360 --> 07:12:27,120
Yeah, fuck it.

11839
07:12:27,200 --> 07:12:27,280
Yeah.

11840
07:12:27,360 --> 07:12:28,020
What time is it?

11841
07:12:28,160 --> 07:12:29,140
It's like...

11842
07:12:30,360 --> 07:12:30,720
Jokey.

11843
07:12:30,720 --> 07:12:32,380
I've

11844
07:12:37,320 --> 07:13:09,220
got it.

11845
07:13:10,260 --> 07:13:11,380
Super Trud?

11846
07:13:11,500 --> 07:13:12,580
How did you do that?

11847
07:13:14,380 --> 07:13:15,240
That's Team Mexico.

11848
07:13:15,700 --> 07:13:16,640
Team Mexico?

11849
07:13:17,160 --> 07:13:18,620
Team Mexico?

11850
07:13:19,080 --> 07:13:19,980
Iron Man or Namor?

11851
07:13:21,000 --> 07:13:22,920
Oh, you want Loki again.

11852
07:13:23,080 --> 07:13:23,380
Hold on.

11853
07:13:24,420 --> 07:13:26,200
I'm on the Loki again, I guess.

11854
07:13:26,580 --> 07:13:26,980
Okay, okay.

11855
07:13:29,240 --> 07:13:30,740
Who'd you play in Overwatch though?

11856
07:13:31,560 --> 07:13:32,400
Number two.

11857
07:13:33,300 --> 07:13:34,120
Number two.

11858
07:13:35,900 --> 07:13:37,780
Get on the Iron Man, buddy.

11859
07:13:39,220 --> 07:13:40,220
Is it my time to shine?

11860
07:13:40,640 --> 07:13:41,440
I think so.

11861
07:13:41,680 --> 07:13:42,840
I didn't know you trolling.

11862
07:13:43,000 --> 07:13:45,300
I thought it was just... I thought it was just bandline.

11863
07:13:45,800 --> 07:13:47,280
It was just bandline and...

11864
07:13:47,920 --> 07:13:49,000
that we fucked up on.

11865
07:13:50,520 --> 07:13:53,120
Because we could have protected...

11866
07:13:53,800 --> 07:13:54,200
Venom.

11867
07:13:55,140 --> 07:13:56,540
30 seconds before you attack.

11868
07:13:57,380 --> 07:13:58,140
Not the tower.

11869
07:13:58,360 --> 07:13:58,700
The Hulk?

11870
07:13:58,980 --> 07:14:00,160
No, don't go Jeff.

11871
07:14:00,200 --> 07:14:00,760
Yeah, go Hulk.

11872
07:14:01,520 --> 07:14:03,240
You guys gonna get angry.

11873
07:14:04,900 --> 07:14:06,380
I was talking to myself.

11874
07:14:06,380 --> 07:14:06,460
No.

11875
07:14:06,920 --> 07:14:07,400
No.

11876
07:14:07,720 --> 07:14:07,720
Oh.

11877
07:14:11,180 --> 07:14:12,520
Alright, let's go.

11878
07:14:17,520 --> 07:14:18,680
Yeah, it was just bad.

11879
07:14:18,740 --> 07:14:20,140
It's always mostly bad lines.

11880
07:14:21,940 --> 07:14:24,320
We got hard fucked over by our bad line.

11881
07:14:24,320 --> 07:14:25,060
You're sniping me, man.

11882
07:14:25,220 --> 07:14:26,180
This ain't a coincidence.

11883
07:14:26,220 --> 07:14:27,560
What you need to do is capture the mission area.

11884
07:14:27,820 --> 07:14:28,560
I was sniping you.

11885
07:14:29,180 --> 07:14:30,120
Hey, you might just be.

11886
07:14:31,560 --> 07:14:32,000
Alright.

11887
07:14:32,620 --> 07:14:33,060
Alright.

11888
07:14:34,280 --> 07:14:35,320
I knew it.

11889
07:14:36,540 --> 07:14:37,560
You're just my biggest fan.

11890
07:14:37,640 --> 07:14:38,340
Okay, I love you.

11891
07:14:38,360 --> 07:14:40,440
If I was Hulk, I would say...

11892
07:14:40,440 --> 07:14:41,620
You caught me green, Andrew.

11893
07:14:42,460 --> 07:14:43,140
Let me know.

11894
07:14:43,860 --> 07:14:44,660
Okay, okay.

11895
07:14:45,560 --> 07:14:47,660
What the fuck is going on?

11896
07:14:47,660 --> 07:14:47,740
What?

11897
07:14:48,280 --> 07:14:50,320
I don't even know what they're saying anymore.

11898
07:14:51,320 --> 07:14:51,800
I'm hurt.

11899
07:14:51,800 --> 07:14:53,020
Oh, they have Captain America.

11900
07:14:53,220 --> 07:14:54,120
My life is over.

11901
07:14:57,540 --> 07:14:59,280
I don't get to play the game.

11902
07:14:59,280 --> 07:14:59,680
I get.

11903
07:15:02,740 --> 07:15:04,600
Cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap.

11904
07:15:04,600 --> 07:15:05,220
I already know.

11905
07:15:07,320 --> 07:15:08,560
Please, please, please, please, please.

11906
07:15:08,880 --> 07:15:09,320
No.

11907
07:15:10,680 --> 07:15:11,840
Oh, I got rezzed.

11908
07:15:11,980 --> 07:15:12,160
Okay.

11909
07:15:12,720 --> 07:15:12,980
Okay.

11910
07:15:22,650 --> 07:15:23,090
Wait.

11911
07:15:24,590 --> 07:15:25,410
Why did we?

11912
07:15:25,550 --> 07:15:27,650
Why did we let them all just stay there?

11913
07:15:27,870 --> 07:15:28,990
What the fuck?

11914
07:15:31,930 --> 07:15:32,810
What the?

11915
07:15:32,810 --> 07:15:34,530
You can never be right, man.

11916
07:15:34,930 --> 07:15:36,490
I got something to learn, man.

11917
07:15:37,770 --> 07:15:38,250
No.

11918
07:15:38,310 --> 07:15:40,870
My glorious King, Rai, is too good at this shit.

11919
07:15:41,350 --> 07:15:43,590
You can never be right.

11920
07:15:44,750 --> 07:15:45,710
That's crazy.

11921
07:15:46,650 --> 07:15:48,950
That's such a crazy thing to say.

11922
07:15:49,230 --> 07:15:50,330
I am ready to put on the show.

11923
07:15:50,350 --> 07:15:53,810
I'm trying to heal our Hulk, but he's just jumping.

11924
07:15:59,680 --> 07:16:00,160
Please.

11925
07:16:04,100 --> 07:16:05,100
Oh my god.

11926
07:16:05,200 --> 07:16:05,860
Oh my god.

11927
07:16:05,860 --> 07:16:06,440
Oh my god.

11928
07:16:07,460 --> 07:16:07,980
Time.

11929
07:16:09,560 --> 07:16:10,800
We need all hands for this.

11930
07:16:10,800 --> 07:16:12,200
That was outright.

11931
07:16:12,560 --> 07:16:13,460
I'm too much, dude.

11932
07:16:14,040 --> 07:16:14,400
You know.

11933
07:16:15,700 --> 07:16:16,820
I don't know why.

11934
07:16:17,080 --> 07:16:17,920
I don't know why.

11935
07:16:18,300 --> 07:16:19,760
I just kind of miscalculated.

11936
07:16:20,340 --> 07:16:22,000
My Iron Man killed me.

11937
07:16:23,020 --> 07:16:24,040
Bro, I don't...

11938
07:16:24,040 --> 07:16:24,400
I don't...

11939
07:16:24,400 --> 07:16:25,680
That's a Ryze character.

11940
07:16:25,900 --> 07:16:26,200
Fuck that.

11941
07:16:26,720 --> 07:16:27,660
Bro, I don't know.

11942
07:16:27,820 --> 07:16:31,400
I saw a fucking match history at 26k in 6 minutes.

11943
07:16:32,520 --> 07:16:34,660
It's like you'll never be like him.

11944
07:16:34,960 --> 07:16:37,500
That's such a fucked up thing to say.

11945
07:16:38,840 --> 07:16:40,020
And not like it.

11946
07:16:40,300 --> 07:16:41,920
I would have said the same thing.

11947
07:16:43,660 --> 07:16:45,120
I would be like, you're not him.

11948
07:16:48,120 --> 07:16:49,260
You're not him.

11949
07:16:51,900 --> 07:16:53,020
Oh my god.

11950
07:16:53,020 --> 07:16:53,140
Thank god.

11951
07:16:53,260 --> 07:16:53,840
Thank god.

11952
07:16:53,940 --> 07:16:55,020
I went through like PTSD.

11953
07:16:55,020 --> 07:16:55,180
I see.

11954
07:17:04,380 --> 07:17:05,040
Come on, Luna.

11955
07:17:09,560 --> 07:17:10,360
Okay, there you go.

11956
07:17:11,600 --> 07:17:12,480
Give me the ace, man.

11957
07:17:12,560 --> 07:17:12,960
Hand it over.

11958
07:17:13,100 --> 07:17:13,360
Come on.

11959
07:17:13,900 --> 07:17:14,480
Man, no.

11960
07:17:14,580 --> 07:17:15,440
I killed Flix before you.

11961
07:17:15,580 --> 07:17:16,000
You're following the goal.

11962
07:17:16,240 --> 07:17:16,540
Uh...

11963
07:17:16,540 --> 07:17:17,280
You have a first racket.

11964
07:17:17,580 --> 07:17:17,700
No, no, no.

11965
07:17:19,440 --> 07:17:21,140
My squid's still be killed, not me.

11966
07:17:21,340 --> 07:17:22,160
So, let's get that straight.

11967
07:17:23,740 --> 07:17:24,340
Yeah, yeah.

11968
07:17:24,640 --> 07:17:25,160
I was fine.

11969
07:17:25,240 --> 07:17:26,560
My games are behind it, man.

11970
07:17:27,820 --> 07:17:29,180
Cosmic Yarn Amplifier.

11971
07:17:29,420 --> 07:17:30,360
Ready to be deployed.

11972
07:17:30,360 --> 07:17:32,860
This is the most Luna I ever got to play, guys.

11973
07:17:33,060 --> 07:17:35,840
Because, surprisingly, I played zero Luna!

11974
07:17:42,920 --> 07:17:44,080
It's actually crazy.

11975
07:17:44,320 --> 07:17:47,280
Like, I played zero Luna that entire tournament.

11976
07:17:54,590 --> 07:17:56,390
I'm just too flexible.

11977
07:17:56,710 --> 07:17:57,330
What can I say?

11978
07:17:58,450 --> 07:17:58,770
Well!

11979
07:18:03,430 --> 07:18:04,190
It's okay.

11980
07:18:04,390 --> 07:18:05,110
It's big enough.

11981
07:18:07,670 --> 07:18:09,890
Not your guy, Taz.

11982
07:18:11,190 --> 07:18:13,370
What the fuck happened?

11983
07:18:13,370 --> 07:18:13,550
What the fuck happened?

11984
07:18:13,670 --> 07:18:14,650
Where did he go?

11985
07:18:16,630 --> 07:18:18,210
Let's do it again!

11986
07:18:19,350 --> 07:18:19,950
What?

11987
07:18:21,690 --> 07:18:23,770
He did that slap dunk twice!

11988
07:18:24,330 --> 07:18:24,910
What the fuck?

11989
07:18:27,410 --> 07:18:28,910
You caught me green-handed.

11990
07:18:29,890 --> 07:18:31,090
Two in a row!

11991
07:18:31,930 --> 07:18:32,150
Two in a row!

11992
07:18:32,150 --> 07:18:32,350
Kubi!

11993
07:18:32,490 --> 07:18:33,110
That was a callback.

11994
07:18:33,250 --> 07:18:33,870
That was a callback.

11995
07:18:34,110 --> 07:18:34,350
No!

11996
07:18:34,550 --> 07:18:36,030
He fucking slammed him!

11997
07:18:36,590 --> 07:18:39,330
The Hulk can pick people up when they're up on the air.

11998
07:18:39,770 --> 07:18:41,510
And he did it twice in a row.

11999
07:18:41,910 --> 07:18:42,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12000
07:18:44,270 --> 07:18:45,010
That's crazy.

12001
07:18:46,110 --> 07:18:46,790
Your best hoop shot?

12002
07:18:49,930 --> 07:18:51,210
Why didn't I play Luna?

12003
07:18:51,550 --> 07:18:53,970
Because Luna is way too strong.

12004
07:18:54,650 --> 07:19:00,850
And, like, the enemy team had people who played Luna, who are, like, one-trick Luna players.

12005
07:19:01,230 --> 07:19:04,310
But I'm not a one-trick Luna player, and I'm, like, super flexible.

12006
07:19:04,310 --> 07:19:05,430
I got the tech.

12007
07:19:05,590 --> 07:19:07,150
Uh, so, like, yeah.

12008
07:19:07,730 --> 07:19:08,770
I couldn't play Luna.

12009
07:19:09,170 --> 07:19:09,570
One life.

12010
07:19:10,150 --> 07:19:10,750
One life.

12011
07:19:11,890 --> 07:19:12,690
One life.

12012
07:19:13,350 --> 07:19:13,490
One life?

12013
07:19:13,510 --> 07:19:14,530
The battle starts in five.

12014
07:19:14,590 --> 07:19:15,550
I don't touch both.

12015
07:19:16,170 --> 07:19:17,270
Three, two, one.

12016
07:19:17,270 --> 07:19:17,850
No, no, no, no.

12017
07:19:17,930 --> 07:19:19,810
The tech, bro, you...

12018
07:19:19,810 --> 07:19:22,390
The tech, you throw the wolf at one support...

12019
07:19:22,390 --> 07:19:26,330
Yeah, but the thing is that you target ban somebody, their weakest player.

12020
07:19:26,510 --> 07:19:28,250
Because their weakest player are new players.

12021
07:19:28,570 --> 07:19:28,790
Yeah, yeah.

12022
07:19:28,990 --> 07:19:37,230
Literally, it's, like, basically, like, um, a lot of players in that tournament, and their team has, like, at least one player that's never played a game before.

12023
07:19:37,850 --> 07:19:42,450
And, like, because our new player was that she could only play Rocket.

12024
07:19:42,730 --> 07:19:45,470
Because she has never played any other character.

12025
07:19:45,510 --> 07:19:51,970
And if we literally put on anything else, she gets, like, super overwhelmed.

12026
07:19:52,210 --> 07:19:55,050
Like, she gets super overwhelmed and, like, she couldn't...

12027
07:19:55,050 --> 07:19:57,970
She literally could not play the game if we didn't put...

12028
07:19:57,970 --> 07:20:00,290
It wouldn't give her her comfort take.

12029
07:20:00,290 --> 07:20:01,890
Because she doesn't...

12030
07:20:01,890 --> 07:20:03,830
I don't think she normally plays FPS games.

12031
07:20:04,850 --> 07:20:05,290
So...

12032
07:20:06,450 --> 07:20:09,730
So we have to, like, let her, uh...

12033
07:20:09,730 --> 07:20:12,570
Uh, because she learned how to play the game within a week.

12034
07:20:12,750 --> 07:20:14,890
Like, she only played the game for one week.

12035
07:20:14,890 --> 07:20:15,810
Like, heal me.

12036
07:20:16,610 --> 07:20:17,090
Thanks.

12037
07:20:17,530 --> 07:20:18,330
Wish I could heal you back.

12038
07:20:18,570 --> 07:20:21,130
So she didn't have a lot of experience with Rivals.

12039
07:20:25,770 --> 07:20:26,250
Oh.

12040
07:20:28,190 --> 07:20:28,670
Oh.

12041
07:20:30,150 --> 07:20:30,270
Oh.

12042
07:20:31,450 --> 07:20:31,930
Oh.

12043
07:20:33,790 --> 07:20:34,150
Oh.

12044
07:20:34,150 --> 07:20:34,470
That's tragic.

12045
07:20:34,950 --> 07:20:35,930
Yeah, like, she...

12046
07:20:35,930 --> 07:20:40,550
When we tried to put on clothes, she got really overwhelmed in general.

12047
07:20:40,550 --> 07:20:41,690
So, like...

12048
07:20:42,830 --> 07:20:44,330
Uh, so we had to...

12049
07:20:44,330 --> 07:20:45,550
We had to play around...

12050
07:20:46,350 --> 07:20:47,670
We had to play around...

12051
07:20:47,670 --> 07:20:49,330
Uh, having a rocket.

12052
07:20:50,870 --> 07:20:51,790
Like, we got...

12053
07:20:51,790 --> 07:20:52,490
And then, like...

12054
07:20:52,490 --> 07:20:54,350
But then the thing is, we can only...

12055
07:20:54,350 --> 07:20:56,450
We had to protect rocket because of it.

12056
07:20:56,590 --> 07:20:57,510
Because they know...

12057
07:20:57,510 --> 07:20:59,210
Everyone knew we had a rocket one trick.

12058
07:20:59,930 --> 07:21:00,330
So...

12059
07:21:00,330 --> 07:21:04,990
Because we had a rocket one trick, Uh, we had to use our protect on that rocket.

12060
07:21:04,990 --> 07:21:14,770
But we also had a player that could only play two tanks, or three tanks, and an entire banline during the tournament.

12061
07:21:14,950 --> 07:21:17,850
Oh, I'm so... I'm not beating that.

12062
07:21:18,190 --> 07:21:22,410
During that entire tournament, the banline, we used it all.

12063
07:21:23,830 --> 07:21:27,150
They banned Tyler's entire roster.

12064
07:21:28,790 --> 07:21:31,410
So he couldn't play anything else.

12065
07:21:32,030 --> 07:21:36,750
We literally... we accidentally fucked up our banline where he couldn't play anything.

12066
07:21:37,490 --> 07:21:38,290
So is that it?

12067
07:21:38,390 --> 07:21:41,710
We fucked over it like we had... it was just unfortunate.

12068
07:21:52,250 --> 07:21:52,790
Okay.

12069
07:21:53,130 --> 07:21:54,190
Alright, I gotta focus up.

12070
07:22:05,330 --> 07:22:05,870
Okay.

12071
07:22:05,870 --> 07:22:07,810
I'm hoping that he has whale.

12072
07:22:08,630 --> 07:22:11,490
That was a little messed up there.

12073
07:22:15,650 --> 07:22:16,210
Alright.

12074
07:22:18,510 --> 07:22:19,490
Where is he?

12075
07:22:21,430 --> 07:22:21,990
Okay.

12076
07:22:22,350 --> 07:22:22,770
I...

12077
07:22:24,710 --> 07:22:27,350
I was waiting for, like, the damage boost.

12078
07:22:30,490 --> 07:22:31,390
But that's okay.

12079
07:22:31,490 --> 07:22:32,010
We didn't need it.

12080
07:22:40,150 --> 07:22:40,890
No, don't worry.

12081
07:22:40,950 --> 07:22:42,530
The tournament ended a while ago.

12082
07:22:42,690 --> 07:22:44,410
I'm just getting therapy right now.

12083
07:22:44,730 --> 07:22:45,130
Alright.

12084
07:22:45,310 --> 07:22:45,950
By doom queuing.

12085
07:22:50,110 --> 07:22:50,570
Oh, yeah.

12086
07:22:50,570 --> 07:22:51,310
Don't lock him, buddy.

12087
07:22:52,030 --> 07:22:52,910
You take out the other here.

12088
07:22:53,810 --> 07:22:56,010
Oh, if I ult now, they... I get through the ratio.

12089
07:22:56,590 --> 07:22:57,090
I need that out.

12090
07:22:59,330 --> 07:22:59,970
Actually, no.

12091
07:23:00,130 --> 07:23:00,930
Just focus for sure.

12092
07:23:06,470 --> 07:23:06,810
Oh, yeah.

12093
07:23:06,890 --> 07:23:14,810
We did our best to try and, uh... teach... teach our newer players as much as we can.

12094
07:23:14,810 --> 07:23:19,570
I realized that she was just much, much more comfortable.

12095
07:23:19,870 --> 07:23:20,190
Holy shit.

12096
07:23:20,190 --> 07:23:20,330
Holy shit.

12097
07:23:20,570 --> 07:23:20,870
Holy shit.

12098
07:23:21,650 --> 07:23:22,550
What did I do?

12099
07:23:23,350 --> 07:23:24,530
I... I can talk about it too.

12100
07:23:26,210 --> 07:23:27,490
Oh, my God.

12101
07:23:28,290 --> 07:23:29,470
Where am I?

12102
07:23:30,330 --> 07:23:30,730
What?

12103
07:23:31,030 --> 07:23:31,430
What?

12104
07:23:31,430 --> 07:23:32,010
Yeah, we did.

12105
07:23:32,190 --> 07:23:32,290
We did.

12106
07:23:32,630 --> 07:23:32,870
One more.

12107
07:23:33,550 --> 07:23:34,170
What's the trapping?

12108
07:23:35,630 --> 07:23:36,850
I don't know.

12109
07:23:37,330 --> 07:23:38,010
I'm putting it.

12110
07:23:38,110 --> 07:23:39,490
I'm putting it to be, like, behind the wire together.

12111
07:23:40,530 --> 07:23:41,650
Okay, I'm back here now.

12112
07:23:43,310 --> 07:23:44,610
I'm back here, I guess.

12113
07:23:47,550 --> 07:23:48,850
I need a stare.

12114
07:23:49,070 --> 07:23:49,870
This is scary.

12115
07:23:51,110 --> 07:23:51,730
No, no.

12116
07:23:51,910 --> 07:23:52,390
It's working.

12117
07:23:52,650 --> 07:23:53,150
It's working.

12118
07:23:53,390 --> 07:23:53,750
Come on.

12119
07:23:56,670 --> 07:23:58,130
Guys, it's working, guys.

12120
07:23:58,130 --> 07:23:58,270
No.

12121
07:23:59,250 --> 07:23:59,770
No!

12122
07:24:00,050 --> 07:24:00,710
My pointer!

12123
07:24:01,430 --> 07:24:01,810
Give me the...

12124
07:24:01,810 --> 07:24:02,310
Give me the...

12125
07:24:02,310 --> 07:24:02,330
Give me the...

12126
07:24:02,330 --> 07:24:02,810
Give me the...

12127
07:24:02,810 --> 07:24:03,990
I need it so much.

12128
07:24:04,350 --> 07:24:04,550
No!

12129
07:24:06,850 --> 07:24:07,370
GG.

12130
07:24:08,190 --> 07:24:08,310
GG.

12131
07:24:09,130 --> 07:24:12,030
Yo, this is like god's time.

12132
07:24:12,150 --> 07:24:13,170
Bad game, actually.

12133
07:24:13,730 --> 07:24:15,050
This is god's time.

12134
07:24:15,750 --> 07:24:16,270
Nice.

12135
07:24:16,890 --> 07:24:17,750
You did it!

12136
07:24:18,550 --> 07:24:22,410
All I'm saying is that I could technically get top 500 today, guys.

12137
07:24:22,550 --> 07:24:24,070
I could technically do it.

12138
07:24:27,950 --> 07:24:29,250
It's, like, right there.

12139
07:24:32,790 --> 07:24:34,790
It's right there, it's just Celestial One.

12140
07:24:35,630 --> 07:24:38,410
I could technically get Celestial One, guys.

12141
07:24:40,450 --> 07:24:42,130
It's, like, within reach.

12142
07:24:42,630 --> 07:24:43,990
Why did I not do a lot of healing?

12143
07:24:52,780 --> 07:24:54,660
To keep these.

12144
07:24:59,760 --> 07:25:01,920
Because this is my form of therapy.

12145
07:25:04,100 --> 07:25:07,480
When I have a bad day, I doom-cue.

12146
07:25:07,840 --> 07:25:10,860
It's not healthy, but it's free.

12147
07:25:17,260 --> 07:25:22,660
It's not healthy, but I don't have to pay for it.

12148
07:25:22,660 --> 07:25:23,560
I...

12149
07:25:28,580 --> 07:25:30,740
Therapy costs... Exactly.

12150
07:25:31,100 --> 07:25:32,640
Therapy costs money.

12151
07:25:33,760 --> 07:25:36,060
Rivals is free.

12152
07:25:36,060 --> 07:25:36,200
I'm free.

12153
07:25:44,650 --> 07:25:45,210
Whoa.

12154
07:25:45,530 --> 07:25:46,550
What the fuck was that?

12155
07:25:55,730 --> 07:25:56,290
Wait.

12156
07:25:56,370 --> 07:25:57,790
I need to get rid of the...

12157
07:25:58,710 --> 07:26:01,510
the Mute thing, the Muting my button.

12158
07:26:02,030 --> 07:26:02,590
When I...

12159
07:26:03,450 --> 07:26:04,570
okay, Toggle Mute.

12160
07:26:04,770 --> 07:26:06,410
Yeah, I gotta get rid of Toggle Mute.

12161
07:26:15,330 --> 07:26:16,530
Oh, it's Window.

12162
07:26:23,260 --> 07:26:23,740
Alright.

12163
07:26:24,220 --> 07:26:25,480
Okay, I'll order food.

12164
07:26:25,800 --> 07:26:26,820
Alright, guys, give me a sec.

12165
07:26:26,920 --> 07:26:28,420
I'll order food and be healthy.

12166
07:26:30,780 --> 07:26:35,320
What if... Okay, how about this, guys?

12167
07:26:36,280 --> 07:26:37,360
How about this?

12168
07:26:38,280 --> 07:26:40,640
I... Guys, I'm AFK because I'm ordering...

12169
07:26:40,640 --> 07:26:41,300
food right now.

12170
07:26:41,480 --> 07:26:42,200
Oh, we have a cook.

12171
07:26:42,400 --> 07:26:43,960
What if we just ban Psylocke?

12172
07:26:44,120 --> 07:26:44,740
What do they do?

12173
07:26:47,860 --> 07:26:49,040
I don't want to eat, though.

12174
07:26:50,680 --> 07:26:52,320
I don't know what I want to eat today.

12175
07:26:54,320 --> 07:26:57,460
Uh, I'm going to get... Oh, I'm going to get Japanese skewers.

12176
07:26:57,860 --> 07:26:58,920
That's always good.

12177
07:26:59,400 --> 07:27:01,280
Oh, I love Japanese skewers.

12178
07:27:02,660 --> 07:27:04,300
Okay, what is the scent, though?

12179
07:27:05,400 --> 07:27:07,020
I don't remember what it has in there.

12180
07:27:07,420 --> 07:27:09,460
Is that, and then I'll get...

12181
07:27:09,460 --> 07:27:11,140
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

12182
07:27:12,460 --> 07:27:14,680
I'll get that, and then I'll get...

12183
07:27:15,360 --> 07:27:16,460
I'll get Oodle.

12184
07:27:20,100 --> 07:27:20,620
And...

12185
07:27:20,620 --> 07:27:22,680
Wait, does it have my favorite?

12186
07:27:23,220 --> 07:27:24,780
I thought... No, it doesn't.

12187
07:27:24,880 --> 07:27:27,040
Okay, I need the chicken meatballs.

12188
07:27:27,900 --> 07:27:28,920
Those are good.

12189
07:27:30,640 --> 07:27:31,540
There's the two.

12190
07:27:31,820 --> 07:27:33,160
Okay, I want that one.

12191
07:27:34,600 --> 07:27:35,560
And then...

12192
07:27:36,040 --> 07:27:37,360
All right, I think that's good.

12193
07:27:39,220 --> 07:27:41,240
All right, I'm going to get Japanese skewers.

12194
07:27:41,480 --> 07:27:44,120
I'm going to treat myself because I deserve it.

12195
07:27:44,560 --> 07:27:47,320
We didn't win, but, like, I deserve it.

12196
07:27:49,740 --> 07:27:50,580
Treat yourself.

12197
07:27:53,000 --> 07:27:56,620
We didn't win, but we get to play with Tyler1, and that's all that matters.

12198
07:27:59,340 --> 07:28:00,680
We got to play with Tyler1.

12199
07:28:02,120 --> 07:28:03,720
Not a lot of people can say that.

12200
07:28:04,580 --> 07:28:06,980
We got to play with Tyler1, and he didn't yell at me.

12201
07:28:06,980 --> 07:28:15,520
I wasn't over there, and I wasn't the problem.

12202
07:28:16,620 --> 07:28:17,440
Yippee!

12203
07:28:18,000 --> 07:28:18,760
True.

12204
07:28:19,120 --> 07:28:20,720
An absolute win.

12205
07:28:22,100 --> 07:28:23,000
All right.

12206
07:28:25,880 --> 07:28:27,180
Wait, what the?

12207
07:28:28,020 --> 07:28:29,120
Why do I hear myself?

12208
07:28:33,910 --> 07:28:34,730
What?

12209
07:28:36,490 --> 07:28:38,170
Why do I hear myself?

12210
07:28:38,750 --> 07:28:40,990
Wait, someone had my stream open.

12211
07:28:45,150 --> 07:28:47,770
Someone had my stream open.

12212
07:28:51,350 --> 07:28:52,090
Oh.

12213
07:28:53,010 --> 07:28:53,970
It's me.

12214
07:28:55,970 --> 07:28:56,970
Wait, what?

12215
07:28:58,770 --> 07:29:00,390
Oh, is it my YouTube premium?

12216
07:29:01,690 --> 07:29:04,190
Why do I... I'm so confused.

12217
07:29:07,470 --> 07:29:09,530
Is it... Oh my god, it's me.

12218
07:29:09,910 --> 07:29:10,730
It's me.

12219
07:29:10,970 --> 07:29:12,010
Oh my god.

12220
07:29:12,370 --> 07:29:13,490
It was actually me.

12221
07:29:15,690 --> 07:29:19,330
JK, I was... It was me this whole entire time.

12222
07:29:20,210 --> 07:29:21,190
Sorry, give me a sec.

12223
07:29:21,450 --> 07:29:25,390
We're AFK right now because I can't... I can't... I can't focus.

12224
07:29:25,930 --> 07:29:28,370
I... It was my YouTube premium.

12225
07:29:28,650 --> 07:29:31,490
It played my YouTube stream for some fucking reason.

12226
07:29:31,930 --> 07:29:33,470
It, like, threw me off.

12227
07:29:33,470 --> 07:29:34,970
I... I forgot.

12228
07:29:35,270 --> 07:29:37,890
I forgot that, like... Oh my god.

12229
07:29:38,110 --> 07:29:39,410
That was so weird.

12230
07:29:39,750 --> 07:29:41,410
I, like, heard myself.

12231
07:29:41,410 --> 07:29:42,530
And I was like, what?

12232
07:29:43,770 --> 07:29:48,190
I realized it was... It was me this entire time.

12233
07:29:54,310 --> 07:29:55,570
Is that crazy?

12234
07:29:56,790 --> 07:29:58,570
In the end, it was just me.

12235
07:29:58,570 --> 07:29:59,290
I'll put this fucking thing.

12236
07:30:03,760 --> 07:30:05,340
No, I just got it!

12237
07:30:05,700 --> 07:30:05,840
Fuck!

12238
07:30:06,060 --> 07:30:07,680
Okay, now... Give me a sec.

12239
07:30:07,780 --> 07:30:08,860
Now me get my...

12240
07:30:13,140 --> 07:30:14,820
Oh my god, they fumbled it?

12241
07:30:15,820 --> 07:30:16,180
Sorry.

12242
07:30:17,520 --> 07:30:19,240
I... I'm, like, all over the place.

12243
07:30:19,400 --> 07:30:20,860
That threw me off so hard.

12244
07:30:20,860 --> 07:30:23,140
Actually, you threw me off!

12245
07:30:23,540 --> 07:30:24,680
Help me!

12246
07:30:31,460 --> 07:30:32,720
Wait, is that pizza?

12247
07:30:33,520 --> 07:30:35,180
Oh my god, it's pizza!

12248
07:30:41,620 --> 07:30:42,920
Oh my god, that's pizza!

12249
07:30:48,760 --> 07:30:52,540
Oh my god, that was not... I timed that incorrectly.

12250
07:30:55,960 --> 07:30:57,200
Okay, I gotta focus up.

12251
07:30:57,300 --> 07:30:58,520
I'm, like, throwing a little.

12252
07:30:58,800 --> 07:31:01,000
Well, not throwing, but, like, I'm not playing.

12253
07:31:01,740 --> 07:31:03,020
That, like, threw me off.

12254
07:31:04,280 --> 07:31:04,680
What?

12255
07:31:05,480 --> 07:31:08,700
When I hurt myself, I, like... It threw me off a lot.

12256
07:31:15,010 --> 07:31:17,530
It, like, made me... It threw up my groove.

12257
07:31:18,170 --> 07:31:21,510
You never... Don't never throw off your... The Emperor's Groom.

12258
07:31:22,510 --> 07:31:23,510
Eh... I'll freeze.

12259
07:31:33,630 --> 07:31:34,190
Okay.

12260
07:31:35,550 --> 07:31:37,570
This place is aching.

12261
07:31:38,370 --> 07:31:38,930
Disappear!

12262
07:31:39,830 --> 07:31:41,150
Oh, okay, never mind.

12263
07:31:41,370 --> 07:31:42,330
Oh, never mind.

12264
07:31:42,510 --> 07:31:43,070
I guess not.

12265
07:31:43,790 --> 07:31:44,670
Dammit, dammit, dammit.

12266
07:31:44,670 --> 07:31:44,970
Oh.

12267
07:31:48,690 --> 07:31:51,970
It was either damage or you die, so...

12268
07:31:51,970 --> 07:31:52,290
Oh, that's true.

12269
07:31:53,010 --> 07:31:53,410
Oh.

12270
07:31:54,250 --> 07:31:54,790
That's fine.

12271
07:32:03,240 --> 07:32:04,040
Nice, alright.

12272
07:32:09,830 --> 07:32:11,150
Nice, I didn't have to...

12273
07:32:11,610 --> 07:32:12,370
Alright, there you go.

12274
07:32:14,330 --> 07:32:15,970
Alright, that's... That's me, here we go.

12275
07:32:15,970 --> 07:32:17,330
The final 10 seconds.

12276
07:32:17,390 --> 07:32:19,350
Yeah, window, is my lucky bit of a bug?

12277
07:32:19,430 --> 07:32:20,490
I think so.

12278
07:32:21,310 --> 07:32:22,670
I'm thinking it is.

12279
07:32:24,590 --> 07:32:25,990
The Borderlands left.

12280
07:32:26,630 --> 07:32:28,470
Wait, I never used my Luna all at once.

12281
07:32:31,090 --> 07:32:32,430
I don't... No.

12282
07:32:34,670 --> 07:32:36,210
Time to switch things up.

12283
07:32:36,230 --> 07:32:38,030
I think I might be full.

12284
07:32:38,970 --> 07:32:40,750
Okay, now I'm gonna go order food.

12285
07:32:40,990 --> 07:32:41,290
For real.

12286
07:32:42,310 --> 07:32:43,490
That's so weird.

12287
07:32:43,610 --> 07:32:45,510
My YouTube Premium accidentally was playing...

12288
07:32:45,510 --> 07:32:46,790
I don't know why I was playing my stream.

12289
07:32:47,290 --> 07:32:47,610
I...

12290
07:32:48,310 --> 07:32:49,930
I was like, what the fuck?

12291
07:32:50,850 --> 07:32:51,810
Alright, food time!

12292
07:32:52,330 --> 07:32:52,610
Yeah!

12293
07:32:54,990 --> 07:32:55,550
Food.

12294
07:32:56,550 --> 07:32:57,670
I love...

12295
07:32:57,670 --> 07:32:59,110
Having food.

12296
07:33:01,670 --> 07:33:03,590
No way, I'd be so sad.

12297
07:33:06,830 --> 07:33:07,750
Guys, it's...

12298
07:33:07,750 --> 07:33:09,330
Wait, can I get a Funky Monkey?

12299
07:33:12,990 --> 07:33:14,690
Can I actually do...

12300
07:33:14,690 --> 07:33:16,590
Oh my god, I want a Funky Monkey.

12301
07:33:17,970 --> 07:33:19,370
I deserve it.

12302
07:33:21,050 --> 07:33:23,030
No, I had Funky Monkey yesterday.

12303
07:33:23,030 --> 07:33:23,670
I shouldn't.

12304
07:33:24,270 --> 07:33:25,150
I'm gonna get...

12305
07:33:25,150 --> 07:33:25,910
I'm gonna get something.

12306
07:33:26,190 --> 07:33:26,610
I'm gonna get...

12307
07:33:28,110 --> 07:33:29,150
I'm gonna get this.

12308
07:33:29,330 --> 07:33:30,550
I'm gonna get a...

12309
07:33:31,890 --> 07:33:33,010
A mango...

12310
07:33:33,010 --> 07:33:35,030
Mango drink with crystal pearls.

12311
07:33:35,030 --> 07:33:37,890
I won't let you know when Hulk wanna smash something.

12312
07:33:42,930 --> 07:33:44,290
Quiet, furry.

12313
07:33:50,170 --> 07:33:52,810
Your carry is ordering food.

12314
07:33:52,810 --> 07:33:53,350
Food.

12315
07:33:53,510 --> 07:33:54,810
3, 2, 1!

12316
07:33:59,110 --> 07:33:59,650
Hey...

12317
07:33:59,650 --> 07:33:59,710
Hey...

12318
07:33:59,710 --> 07:34:00,730
Hey...

12319
07:34:00,730 --> 07:34:00,930
Hey...

12320
07:34:00,930 --> 07:34:01,090
Hey...

12321
07:34:02,590 --> 07:34:03,130
Hey...

12322
07:34:06,220 --> 07:34:07,140
Where is he?

12323
07:34:07,260 --> 07:34:08,180
I like the cold.

12324
07:34:08,440 --> 07:34:08,900
I was fine.

12325
07:34:11,710 --> 07:34:13,470
Oh, there's a flyer.

12326
07:34:13,630 --> 07:34:15,010
That's the gold scar right there.

12327
07:34:15,890 --> 07:34:16,790
That actually is.

12328
07:34:17,150 --> 07:34:17,690
What?

12329
07:34:20,450 --> 07:34:21,990
Okay, we definitely...

12330
07:34:21,990 --> 07:34:22,690
Maybe a...

12331
07:34:25,940 --> 07:34:27,100
No, it's different.

12332
07:34:29,360 --> 07:34:30,380
It's a furry.

12333
07:34:32,500 --> 07:34:35,080
Did you know him and Shroud went to a furry convention?

12334
07:34:35,400 --> 07:34:36,120
Isn't that crazy?

12335
07:34:39,180 --> 07:34:41,540
I didn't know Shroud was also a furry.

12336
07:34:48,220 --> 07:34:48,820
Oh.

12337
07:34:52,860 --> 07:34:53,460
Oh.

12338
07:34:53,460 --> 07:34:53,860
Hey, guys.

12339
07:34:53,920 --> 07:34:55,860
I'm sorry I thought my Luna would heal me.

12340
07:34:56,880 --> 07:34:57,580
My bad.

12341
07:35:00,120 --> 07:35:00,860
I'm sorry.

12342
07:35:02,660 --> 07:35:04,960
Oh my god, there's so many...

12343
07:35:06,500 --> 07:35:07,700
There's so many...

12344
07:35:07,700 --> 07:35:09,260
How did my team live?

12345
07:35:11,560 --> 07:35:13,820
Wait, my team lived that?

12346
07:35:17,580 --> 07:35:19,400
I'm a little scared, guys.

12347
07:35:20,420 --> 07:35:20,820
Oh, okay.

12348
07:35:20,880 --> 07:35:21,340
Nevermind.

12349
07:35:21,420 --> 07:35:21,800
Big!

12350
07:35:22,980 --> 07:35:24,760
Bro, stop screaming the mic.

12351
07:35:26,620 --> 07:35:30,580
You're gonna get so fucking loud.

12352
07:35:31,460 --> 07:35:32,120
GG, guys.

12353
07:35:32,420 --> 07:35:33,400
Everyone's screaming your mic!

12354
07:35:35,900 --> 07:35:36,800
No, I didn't.

12355
07:35:37,240 --> 07:35:38,920
Another epic victory!

12356
07:35:39,160 --> 07:35:40,600
We win!

12357
07:35:50,330 --> 07:35:50,730
Yay!

12358
07:35:54,550 --> 07:35:55,070
Me too.

12359
07:35:55,110 --> 07:35:56,530
I thought he was gonna say something bad.

12360
07:35:58,090 --> 07:35:59,470
Wait, did my food order it?

12361
07:35:59,510 --> 07:36:00,290
I didn't even realize.

12362
07:36:00,630 --> 07:36:01,170
Oh, I did.

12363
07:36:01,370 --> 07:36:01,890
Okay, nice.

12364
07:36:02,350 --> 07:36:03,430
I couldn't tell.

12365
07:36:04,170 --> 07:36:05,150
I have to be sure.

12366
07:36:06,530 --> 07:36:07,410
Alright, don't worry.

12367
07:36:07,670 --> 07:36:08,530
I got my food.

12368
07:36:10,590 --> 07:36:12,090
Okay, how about this, guys?

12369
07:36:13,150 --> 07:36:13,550
We...

12370
07:36:14,530 --> 07:36:16,070
I know what to do.

12371
07:36:17,810 --> 07:36:18,290
We...

12372
07:36:18,290 --> 07:36:18,810
We...

12373
07:36:18,810 --> 07:36:19,250
Play...

12374
07:36:19,250 --> 07:36:19,890
We...

12375
07:36:19,890 --> 07:36:20,310
Okay.

12376
07:36:20,850 --> 07:36:22,510
I'll do Goodnight Dragoons.

12377
07:36:22,850 --> 07:36:25,150
And then after Goodnight Dragoons, I'm coming back.

12378
07:36:26,330 --> 07:36:27,290
No, I...

12379
07:36:27,290 --> 07:36:29,050
No, my momentum's gonna be gone.

12380
07:36:29,190 --> 07:36:30,170
No, I don't think so.

12381
07:36:30,490 --> 07:36:30,970
Nevermind.

12382
07:36:31,650 --> 07:36:36,070
I know for a fact the moment I get off Rivals, I'm not gonna wanna play Rivals.

12383
07:36:36,070 --> 07:36:36,250
Listen.

12384
07:36:41,350 --> 07:36:42,150
Yeah, I...

12385
07:36:42,150 --> 07:36:42,890
I know it.

12386
07:36:43,250 --> 07:36:43,610
I...

12387
07:36:43,610 --> 07:36:44,070
I know.

12388
07:36:44,370 --> 07:36:45,490
That's how I work.

12389
07:36:45,650 --> 07:36:46,270
Like, the moment...

12390
07:36:46,270 --> 07:36:48,530
Like, I'm going off, like, a momentum right now.

12391
07:36:49,170 --> 07:36:49,530
I...

12392
07:36:52,690 --> 07:36:55,090
I'm going off of, like, how I currently...

12393
07:36:55,090 --> 07:37:00,470
Like, you know how, like, when you stop after you take a little break, you're just like, you know, I don't really wanna play, keep playing.

12394
07:37:00,470 --> 07:37:01,610
Like, that's...

12395
07:37:01,610 --> 07:37:03,210
If I stop...

12396
07:37:03,210 --> 07:37:04,090
It ends.

12397
07:37:14,350 --> 07:37:15,950
Oh, we could do it tomorrow.

12398
07:37:16,930 --> 07:37:19,210
It's okay if I do Goodnight Dragoons tomorrow.

12399
07:37:22,800 --> 07:37:23,840
Then it ends.

12400
07:37:25,040 --> 07:37:27,460
Guys, but I'm feeling it though.

12401
07:37:27,840 --> 07:37:29,280
I'm feeling it.

12402
07:37:35,710 --> 07:37:37,850
Guys, I'm feeling it.

12403
07:37:38,270 --> 07:37:39,930
It's been fun.

12404
07:37:49,060 --> 07:37:50,200
You silly...

12405
07:37:50,200 --> 07:37:51,060
Yeah, and I'm...

12406
07:37:52,680 --> 07:37:54,140
I actually got a lot of sleep today.

12407
07:37:54,780 --> 07:37:56,220
I got a lot of sleep today.

12408
07:37:56,480 --> 07:37:57,800
I was, uh...

12409
07:37:58,560 --> 07:37:59,560
I was chilling.

12410
07:38:10,250 --> 07:38:10,650
Whoa!

12411
07:38:11,150 --> 07:38:12,070
I'm having fun.

12412
07:38:12,550 --> 07:38:13,150
Honestly.

12413
07:38:13,750 --> 07:38:14,590
I'm having...

12414
07:38:15,110 --> 07:38:16,730
I'm having a lot of fun.

12415
07:38:18,030 --> 07:38:18,630
Uh...

12416
07:38:19,570 --> 07:38:20,170
And...

12417
07:38:22,310 --> 07:38:22,610
And...

12418
07:38:22,910 --> 07:38:23,510
It was...

12419
07:38:23,510 --> 07:38:24,030
It's nice.

12420
07:38:24,210 --> 07:38:24,590
It was...

12421
07:38:24,590 --> 07:38:25,230
It was...

12422
07:38:25,230 --> 07:38:25,750
It's...

12423
07:38:25,750 --> 07:38:26,110
It's...

12424
07:38:26,110 --> 07:38:26,550
It's...

12425
07:38:26,550 --> 07:38:27,450
It's...

12426
07:38:27,450 --> 07:38:29,650
This is free therapy.

12427
07:38:34,310 --> 07:38:35,890
I'm not gonna lie.

12428
07:38:36,170 --> 07:38:37,730
I won't lie to you guys.

12429
07:38:38,030 --> 07:38:40,930
But I am enjoying my free therapy right now.

12430
07:38:45,950 --> 07:38:48,730
Alright, I'll see how I feel.

12431
07:38:54,370 --> 07:39:00,250
I'm gonna see how I feel when my food comes here.

12432
07:39:01,890 --> 07:39:07,550
When my food comes here, I'll see if I wanna... if I... Oh, hey, it's window again.

12433
07:39:08,230 --> 07:39:08,850
What, Tiko?

12434
07:39:10,050 --> 07:39:10,910
Actually, I don't know.

12435
07:39:10,910 --> 07:39:12,090
Tiko's... yeah, Tiko.

12436
07:39:13,030 --> 07:39:14,890
But, oh my gosh, our elo's getting higher.

12437
07:39:20,310 --> 07:39:21,970
I recognize these names.

12438
07:39:27,380 --> 07:39:28,640
Oh, wait, Hans?

12439
07:39:31,140 --> 07:39:32,820
Oh, yeah, he is on the enemy team.

12440
07:39:49,000 --> 07:39:51,380
Ooh, our elo's getting higher.

12441
07:39:54,540 --> 07:39:57,040
Wait, is top 500 still...

12442
07:39:57,040 --> 07:39:59,400
I only know one person who perma-bends Thalak first.

12443
07:39:59,600 --> 07:40:00,360
They have an Iron Man.

12444
07:40:01,820 --> 07:40:02,340
Which one?

12445
07:40:02,680 --> 07:40:03,560
Wait, no, let them.

12446
07:40:03,680 --> 07:40:03,940
Let them.

12447
07:40:04,480 --> 07:40:05,140
Oh, you wanna?

12448
07:40:05,280 --> 07:40:05,780
You wanna let it?

12449
07:40:05,880 --> 07:40:06,040
Okay.

12450
07:40:06,440 --> 07:40:07,200
It's the gold scar.

12451
07:40:08,260 --> 07:40:08,840
Alright, we're done.

12452
07:40:12,280 --> 07:40:13,260
Do we... Okay.

12453
07:40:15,360 --> 07:40:17,780
How far... Actually, like, how far is top 500?

12454
07:40:17,940 --> 07:40:19,200
Is it GM2 or GM1?

12455
07:40:19,500 --> 07:40:20,520
Free Therapy!

12456
07:40:20,700 --> 07:40:20,860
Yay!

12457
07:40:21,580 --> 07:40:23,240
Yoko, thank you for the super chat.

12458
07:40:23,400 --> 07:40:23,680
Thank you.

12459
07:40:23,840 --> 07:40:24,400
Thank you.

12460
07:40:34,440 --> 07:40:35,940
It's almost GM1?

12461
07:40:36,140 --> 07:40:36,520
Oh, yeah.

12462
07:40:39,940 --> 07:40:40,340
Fuck it.

12463
07:40:40,440 --> 07:40:40,900
Let's go.

12464
07:40:41,200 --> 07:40:42,180
Good night, Fragoons.

12465
07:40:42,440 --> 07:40:42,580
Tomorrow.

12466
07:40:43,100 --> 07:40:43,220
Go!

12467
07:40:43,380 --> 07:40:44,320
Thank you for the super chat.

12468
07:40:44,460 --> 07:40:44,680
Thank you.

12469
07:40:44,820 --> 07:40:45,340
Thank you.

12470
07:40:45,680 --> 07:40:46,000
Yay!

12471
07:41:02,910 --> 07:41:03,890
Alright, let's go.

12472
07:41:10,380 --> 07:41:10,800
Alright.

12473
07:41:19,940 --> 07:41:21,420
Uh, who do I give this to?

12474
07:41:22,300 --> 07:41:22,720
Wolverine.

12475
07:41:26,040 --> 07:41:28,660
I don't know what 4947 is.

12476
07:41:29,060 --> 07:41:33,680
Like, there's, like, these numbers for it, but, like, I don't know where that is, actually.

12477
07:41:41,180 --> 07:41:43,580
I don't know where that is, on the actual scale.

12478
07:41:44,040 --> 07:41:45,220
I don't know where that is, on the actual scale.

12479
07:41:45,240 --> 07:41:46,160
Here they come.

12480
07:41:46,560 --> 07:41:50,020
Never say Hulk is stupid, just because Banner is smart.

12481
07:41:51,100 --> 07:41:53,560
You need to stop that vehicle in strats.

12482
07:41:55,240 --> 07:41:55,900
Thank you.

12483
07:41:56,580 --> 07:41:56,960
You're welcome.

12484
07:41:58,340 --> 07:41:59,220
I was fine.

12485
07:41:59,380 --> 07:41:59,940
Thank you.

12486
07:42:00,100 --> 07:42:00,900
I like the code.

12487
07:42:04,450 --> 07:42:06,350
They do not get past us.

12488
07:42:06,630 --> 07:42:07,070
Understand?

12489
07:42:07,450 --> 07:42:07,970
Oh my god.

12490
07:42:11,270 --> 07:42:15,890
I hear so many peop- I hear Mr. Vance- Yeah, I was gonna say, I hear movement.

12491
07:42:18,230 --> 07:42:18,670
What?!

12492
07:42:18,670 --> 07:42:19,050
Okay.

12493
07:42:19,450 --> 07:42:20,670
I'm sad I didn't hit, though.

12494
07:42:23,270 --> 07:42:24,450
I'm sad I didn't hit.

12495
07:42:24,450 --> 07:42:25,670
Oh, that's not good.

12496
07:42:30,040 --> 07:42:31,920
I don't see enough movement.

12497
07:42:38,200 --> 07:42:38,800
Jesus!

12498
07:42:39,940 --> 07:42:41,740
Oh my god, I-

12499
07:42:50,770 --> 07:42:51,370
Okay.

12500
07:42:53,010 --> 07:42:54,530
Oh my god, please!

12501
07:42:57,810 --> 07:42:58,410
Please!

12502
07:43:00,530 --> 07:43:06,990
Oh my god, I had to, like, do- Do so many, like, three- I had to move so much.

12503
07:43:10,430 --> 07:43:11,510
That was unlucky.

12504
07:43:12,470 --> 07:43:13,890
I knew it was, like, rotating.

12505
07:43:15,810 --> 07:43:17,510
I had to rotate everywhere.

12506
07:43:25,970 --> 07:43:26,490
Okay.

12507
07:43:27,670 --> 07:43:29,710
Try not to, like, hit him.

12508
07:43:29,710 --> 07:43:33,110
When he- Cause, like, in this elo- There's so- People are so good.

12509
07:43:33,470 --> 07:43:36,690
Like- Iron Fist players are really good at- Knowing when to block.

12510
07:43:36,910 --> 07:43:43,770
And I'm, like- Trying not to, like, encourage- Knowing when to, like, not shoot.

12511
07:43:48,350 --> 07:43:50,110
I'm trying to play next to my-

12512
07:43:53,810 --> 07:43:54,210
Okay.

12513
07:43:56,510 --> 07:43:56,910
Alright.

12514
07:43:56,910 --> 07:43:58,890
So far, I've got you!

12515
07:44:05,810 --> 07:44:10,050
Wait, when did- When did, like, people call each other PDFs now?

12516
07:44:10,470 --> 07:44:13,550
Like- Who was that?

12517
07:44:13,590 --> 07:44:14,430
Is that, like-

12518
07:44:19,110 --> 07:44:22,170
Is that, like, just a- Rivals thing?

12519
07:44:23,450 --> 07:44:26,470
Cause it's like- Oh my god, this is a stack lock.

12520
07:44:26,470 --> 07:44:27,590
This lobby is so stacked.

12521
07:44:27,710 --> 07:44:28,610
This lobby is so scary.

12522
07:44:28,610 --> 07:44:31,530
This- This is literally, like, all- Almost all pro players.

12523
07:44:31,710 --> 07:44:32,450
And then I'm here.

12524
07:44:32,950 --> 07:44:37,710
Like- I'm literally, like- The non-pro in this lobby.

12525
07:44:38,130 --> 07:44:38,910
Oh my god.

12526
07:44:39,430 --> 07:44:39,950
Wait.

12527
07:44:40,250 --> 07:44:43,590
The non, like, top 500 pro player in this lobby.

12528
07:44:43,910 --> 07:44:47,990
I- I just

12529
07:44:52,430 --> 07:44:53,910
realized how stacked this lobby is.

12530
07:44:54,070 --> 07:44:54,190
Ooh.

12531
07:44:54,190 --> 07:44:54,270
Ooh.

12532
07:44:54,710 --> 07:44:56,730
I'm nearly in the pro lobby right now.

12533
07:44:57,110 --> 07:44:59,290
I'm just- And I'm just a regular guy.

12534
07:44:59,870 --> 07:45:00,990
There it goes, right?

12535
07:45:08,510 --> 07:45:09,470
Oh, that's bad.

12536
07:45:10,750 --> 07:45:11,810
There's the cart!

12537
07:45:12,250 --> 07:45:12,930
The cart!

12538
07:45:13,690 --> 07:45:14,550
The cart!

12539
07:45:14,550 --> 07:45:15,530
Oh my god.

12540
07:45:15,990 --> 07:45:16,670
Dude.

12541
07:45:17,150 --> 07:45:18,290
You're fucking- Dude.

12542
07:45:18,530 --> 07:45:21,830
The cart was getting- Who was pushing the cart?

12543
07:45:23,110 --> 07:45:25,410
Just don't- Just don't yell.

12544
07:45:26,150 --> 07:45:26,490
Just don't yell.

12545
07:45:35,170 --> 07:45:35,850
Nice.

12546
07:45:37,250 --> 07:45:38,310
Wait, is it my webcam?

12547
07:45:38,310 --> 07:45:39,370
Your powers on the arm!

12548
07:45:39,390 --> 07:45:39,930
No, look.

12549
07:45:40,170 --> 07:45:40,310
Okay.

12550
07:45:40,950 --> 07:45:43,270
I'll- I'll do it just for an example.

12551
07:45:44,270 --> 07:45:47,190
When I get loud, it's like fucked up the mic!

12552
07:45:47,510 --> 07:45:48,170
You see?

12553
07:45:48,250 --> 07:45:48,530
Wow!

12554
07:45:51,010 --> 07:45:51,990
Hello, super helmet!

12555
07:45:52,590 --> 07:45:53,390
It's not very fun.

12556
07:45:55,730 --> 07:45:56,610
I had no idea.

12557
07:45:56,730 --> 07:45:57,130
It's a new mic.

12558
07:45:57,790 --> 07:45:58,030
Keep popping.

12559
07:46:00,350 --> 07:46:01,030
Keep popping.

12560
07:46:01,190 --> 07:46:01,410
Keep popping.

12561
07:46:03,530 --> 07:46:05,030
Up, here I go.

12562
07:46:05,130 --> 07:46:06,250
Walking over.

12563
07:46:06,510 --> 07:46:07,750
Up, here I go.

12564
07:46:07,750 --> 07:46:09,830
Getting beat up by trees.

12565
07:46:10,150 --> 07:46:11,130
Oh, here I go.

12566
07:46:14,870 --> 07:46:16,990
Guess I just died.

12567
07:46:19,290 --> 07:46:25,190
Yeah, everyone on the enemy team and my team are like actual players.

12568
07:46:25,710 --> 07:46:28,610
I'm a VTuber that plays for fun.

12569
07:46:32,790 --> 07:46:34,790
They play this game every day.

12570
07:46:34,990 --> 07:46:35,730
How am I here?

12571
07:46:39,430 --> 07:46:41,110
How am I here?

12572
07:46:41,590 --> 07:46:41,890
How am I here?

12573
07:46:45,950 --> 07:46:47,150
My god.

12574
07:46:52,650 --> 07:46:54,710
I'm just a little guy.

12575
07:46:55,110 --> 07:46:56,770
In my little world.

12576
07:46:57,430 --> 07:46:59,110
Trying to figure out.

12577
07:47:05,350 --> 07:47:06,760
Just a little guy.

12578
07:47:09,880 --> 07:47:11,660
Just a virtual woman.

12579
07:47:13,080 --> 07:47:14,620
Trying to figure out.

12580
07:47:19,360 --> 07:47:19,900
Oh.

12581
07:47:24,700 --> 07:47:26,580
That was a hate crime right there.

12582
07:47:28,240 --> 07:47:29,160
Oh my god.

12583
07:47:29,500 --> 07:47:30,020
Oh my god.

12584
07:47:30,020 --> 07:47:30,620
Where?

12585
07:47:30,780 --> 07:47:31,280
Where?

12586
07:47:31,420 --> 07:47:31,840
There she is.

12587
07:47:32,020 --> 07:47:34,580
I am ready to put on a show.

12588
07:47:41,540 --> 07:47:42,540
Oh no.

12589
07:47:46,510 --> 07:47:48,130
I tried my best.

12590
07:47:49,330 --> 07:47:51,310
I was so close to a hundred.

12591
07:47:52,030 --> 07:47:53,950
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

12592
07:47:54,950 --> 07:47:55,570
Bro.

12593
07:47:56,010 --> 07:47:58,830
I am

12594
07:48:02,410 --> 07:48:04,450
ready to kill.

12595
07:48:04,710 --> 07:48:05,370
I'm ready to kill.

12596
07:48:05,370 --> 07:48:06,190
Thank you so much.

12597
07:48:06,750 --> 07:48:07,070
Yeah.

12598
07:48:11,430 --> 07:48:12,770
Oh my god.

12599
07:48:16,170 --> 07:48:17,050
No.

12600
07:48:24,070 --> 07:48:25,210
Oh my god.

12601
07:48:28,030 --> 07:48:28,930
Oh my god.

12602
07:48:35,250 --> 07:48:35,970
Jesus Christ.

12603
07:48:39,490 --> 07:48:40,350
Oh my god.

12604
07:48:40,610 --> 07:48:44,670
Marble Rivals may be our free therapy, but this silly bird is our $5 therapy.

12605
07:48:44,690 --> 07:48:45,610
We also love you.

12606
07:48:45,750 --> 07:48:45,890
Thank you.

12607
07:48:45,990 --> 07:48:46,290
Thank you.

12608
07:48:46,290 --> 07:48:46,550
Thank you.

12609
07:48:46,650 --> 07:48:46,650
Thank you.

12610
07:48:46,650 --> 07:48:47,630
It was super chat, Tic Tac.

12611
07:48:47,790 --> 07:48:48,010
Thank you.

12612
07:48:48,130 --> 07:48:48,630
Thank you.

12613
07:48:48,730 --> 07:48:49,790
I really appreciate it.

12614
07:48:49,910 --> 07:48:50,890
Thank you, guys.

12615
07:48:56,110 --> 07:48:56,510
Jeez.

12616
07:49:09,470 --> 07:49:09,930
Oh my god.

12617
07:49:09,950 --> 07:49:11,270
These games are so intense.

12618
07:49:11,510 --> 07:49:15,830
These games are actually... so intense, guys.

12619
07:49:22,330 --> 07:49:23,090
Oh!

12620
07:49:23,090 --> 07:49:25,410
There's so many actual players!

12621
07:49:28,430 --> 07:49:30,690
There's so many real players!

12622
07:49:31,770 --> 07:49:33,970
These players are so real!

12623
07:49:45,890 --> 07:49:47,610
Oh my god, that's it.

12624
07:49:48,030 --> 07:49:49,830
Yeah, that's... oh my god.

12625
07:49:52,630 --> 07:49:53,470
Sorry, guys.

12626
07:49:53,550 --> 07:49:54,930
I have to actually focus really hard.

12627
07:50:03,050 --> 07:50:03,690
Okay.

12628
07:50:05,310 --> 07:50:06,170
Oh, fuck.

12629
07:50:07,290 --> 07:50:08,350
Oh, no!

12630
07:50:15,530 --> 07:50:16,170
Nice.

12631
07:50:22,230 --> 07:50:23,470
Oh, not nice.

12632
07:50:23,650 --> 07:50:24,070
Not nice.

12633
07:50:29,150 --> 07:50:30,510
Trying to find...

12634
07:50:45,430 --> 07:50:45,990
Alright.

12635
07:50:47,490 --> 07:50:48,330
Oh, no.

12636
07:50:52,930 --> 07:50:53,950
Oh my god.

12637
07:50:54,750 --> 07:50:59,330
I am ready to put on a show!

12638
07:51:00,030 --> 07:51:01,010
Oh my god.

12639
07:51:01,190 --> 07:51:03,230
This fight is never ending!

12640
07:51:06,150 --> 07:51:06,710
No!

12641
07:51:07,650 --> 07:51:08,130
Don't

12642
07:51:12,000 --> 07:51:12,580
give them another...

12643
07:51:12,580 --> 07:51:12,860
No!

12644
07:51:13,500 --> 07:51:15,440
The entire lobby...

12645
07:51:15,440 --> 07:51:16,500
They're all really good.

12646
07:51:16,500 --> 07:51:17,240
But it's cause...

12647
07:51:17,240 --> 07:51:17,960
The...

12648
07:51:17,960 --> 07:51:20,420
I'm like, literally the odd one out right now.

12649
07:51:23,040 --> 07:51:23,640
I'm...

12650
07:51:23,640 --> 07:51:25,440
I'm the odd one out.

12651
07:51:26,020 --> 07:51:27,780
I'm literally the old person...

12652
07:51:27,780 --> 07:51:28,280
That...

12653
07:51:28,280 --> 07:51:29,180
Is like...

12654
07:51:29,180 --> 07:51:29,960
Not...

12655
07:51:29,960 --> 07:51:31,560
Not supposed to be here.

12656
07:51:31,560 --> 07:51:32,280
I...

12657
07:51:32,280 --> 07:51:32,680
I...

12658
07:51:38,300 --> 07:51:39,480
I'm Luna Snow.

12659
07:51:39,680 --> 07:51:40,520
All these players?

12660
07:51:40,740 --> 07:51:41,020
Okay.

12661
07:51:41,480 --> 07:51:42,160
Pro...

12662
07:51:42,160 --> 07:51:42,940
Pro...

12663
07:51:43,560 --> 07:51:44,260
Pro...

12664
07:51:44,260 --> 07:51:46,320
I think this is...

12665
07:51:46,320 --> 07:51:46,660
Pro...

12666
07:51:47,700 --> 07:51:48,380
Um...

12667
07:51:48,380 --> 07:51:49,160
This is Smurf.

12668
07:51:49,280 --> 07:51:49,880
I don't know who.

12669
07:51:51,000 --> 07:51:51,680
Uh...

12670
07:51:52,440 --> 07:51:53,120
Pro...

12671
07:51:53,820 --> 07:51:54,500
Pro...

12672
07:51:54,500 --> 07:51:55,900
Plays every day.

12673
07:51:56,140 --> 07:51:57,560
Top 500 every day.

12674
07:51:58,800 --> 07:51:59,440
Uh...

12675
07:51:59,440 --> 07:52:00,220
Plays every day.

12676
07:52:00,320 --> 07:52:01,420
Top 500 every day.

12677
07:52:02,200 --> 07:52:02,660
Uh...

12678
07:52:03,220 --> 07:52:05,360
I think this is a pro Smurf account.

12679
07:52:08,120 --> 07:52:08,980
Round two.

12680
07:52:09,460 --> 07:52:09,700
Play up.

12681
07:52:10,120 --> 07:52:10,900
I always love my balls.

12682
07:52:11,280 --> 07:52:12,840
Now I think they're great.

12683
07:52:16,920 --> 07:52:17,600
Um...

12684
07:52:17,600 --> 07:52:18,760
I'm the odd one here.

12685
07:52:19,120 --> 07:52:20,760
Did you hear that?

12686
07:52:22,460 --> 07:52:24,380
Thirty seconds before you attack.

12687
07:52:24,860 --> 07:52:25,300
Get ready.

12688
07:52:29,880 --> 07:52:31,200
Oh my gosh.

12689
07:52:33,520 --> 07:52:35,300
The thing is...

12690
07:52:35,300 --> 07:52:37,020
These guys play every day.

12691
07:52:37,280 --> 07:52:37,760
I don't.

12692
07:52:38,500 --> 07:52:40,120
I don't play every day.

12693
07:52:40,240 --> 07:52:42,120
This season has been my least played season.

12694
07:52:43,720 --> 07:52:45,900
I actually don't play every day this season.

12695
07:52:50,760 --> 07:52:52,600
So it's, like, really stressful.

12696
07:53:13,400 --> 07:53:16,900
So it's, like, much more... that's why I'm like, okay, guys, I need to...

12697
07:53:16,900 --> 07:53:25,040
I'm, like, not talking much right now because I'm actually so full focus right now because these games are, like, incredibly try-hard.

12698
07:53:28,680 --> 07:53:33,100
Like, I have to, like, actually think about what I'm doing.

12699
07:53:41,320 --> 07:53:42,660
The fuck is going on?

12700
07:53:43,660 --> 07:53:46,820
Like, I have to be aware of my surroundings right now.

12701
07:53:53,350 --> 07:53:53,870
Jesus.

12702
07:53:53,870 --> 07:53:54,070
What is this?

12703
07:54:03,520 --> 07:54:04,340
Oh, my God.

12704
07:54:04,540 --> 07:54:05,420
Oh, my God.

12705
07:54:05,540 --> 07:54:05,740
No!

12706
07:54:09,230 --> 07:54:10,630
Oh, that's unlucky.

12707
07:54:11,590 --> 07:54:13,730
I didn't know where the Iron Man was.

12708
07:54:21,110 --> 07:54:22,310
That was my bad shit.

12709
07:54:22,610 --> 07:54:23,650
I fucking did that.

12710
07:54:27,920 --> 07:54:28,900
Jesus Christ.

12711
07:54:32,280 --> 07:54:33,820
Oh, my God.

12712
07:54:34,300 --> 07:54:36,780
I tried so hard to heal him.

12713
07:54:41,460 --> 07:54:43,180
Oh, my God.

12714
07:54:43,760 --> 07:54:47,360
It's a hard knock knife for us.

12715
07:54:48,460 --> 07:54:49,320
Oh.

12716
07:54:54,780 --> 07:54:58,360
It's a hard knock knife for us.

12717
07:54:58,520 --> 07:55:01,480
It's a hard knock knife for me.

12718
07:55:01,480 --> 07:55:04,880
I'm so happy.

12719
07:55:07,960 --> 07:55:08,960
Bye.

12720
07:55:10,120 --> 07:55:11,120
Bye.

12721
07:55:11,120 --> 07:55:11,160
What?

12722
07:55:11,720 --> 07:55:15,700
She grabbed- how does she time that?

12723
07:55:16,580 --> 07:55:19,480
She timed that perfectly.

12724
07:55:20,260 --> 07:55:20,720
Come back.

12725
07:55:21,500 --> 07:55:23,340
See, this is what I mean, guys.

12726
07:55:23,740 --> 07:55:24,760
This is...

12727
07:55:27,180 --> 07:55:29,800
These guys are at a whole new level.

12728
07:55:30,920 --> 07:55:33,300
They literally... they... he timed?

12729
07:55:34,440 --> 07:55:41,380
He timed... He timed when my ult ended.

12730
07:55:41,660 --> 07:55:42,840
So he could grab me.

12731
07:55:43,160 --> 07:55:44,240
That's crazy.

12732
07:55:49,670 --> 07:55:53,370
The fact that he was able to do that is actually crazy.

12733
07:56:02,420 --> 07:56:03,620
Oh my god.

12734
07:56:05,700 --> 07:56:07,720
I'm trying my best.

12735
07:56:08,800 --> 07:56:11,140
I'm trying my... oh my god.

12736
07:56:11,260 --> 07:56:11,800
Thank you.

12737
07:56:12,680 --> 07:56:15,340
I am being juggled everywhere.

12738
07:56:16,000 --> 07:56:19,400
I... I'm being juggled everywhere.

12739
07:56:19,400 --> 07:56:19,780
Please.

12740
07:56:24,220 --> 07:56:25,720
Oh my god.

12741
07:56:25,720 --> 07:56:25,860
What?

12742
07:56:30,390 --> 07:56:32,750
Memorize the dance routine.

12743
07:56:33,170 --> 07:56:36,650
Did he laugh?

12744
07:56:36,830 --> 07:56:37,550
He didn't laugh.

12745
07:56:38,210 --> 07:56:40,170
What the fuck, Tika, was that?

12746
07:56:40,770 --> 07:56:41,850
What was that?

12747
07:56:52,460 --> 07:56:53,260
Jesus Christ.

12748
07:56:55,940 --> 07:56:56,980
Oh my god.

12749
07:56:57,240 --> 07:56:58,640
I had to use it.

12750
07:56:59,120 --> 07:57:00,560
Everyone was so alone.

12751
07:57:00,580 --> 07:57:01,420
I got scared.

12752
07:57:04,720 --> 07:57:05,280
Three.

12753
07:57:06,000 --> 07:57:06,560
Two.

12754
07:57:07,680 --> 07:57:08,240
One.

12755
07:57:11,700 --> 07:57:12,980
This is where I die.

12756
07:57:13,320 --> 07:57:14,540
This is where I die.

12757
07:57:14,640 --> 07:57:16,260
There's four people on my body.

12758
07:57:16,260 --> 07:57:17,080
There's...

12759
07:57:20,650 --> 07:57:23,230
Like, I... I don't know what to do.

12760
07:57:30,770 --> 07:57:32,290
Yeah, I'm coming back.

12761
07:57:33,410 --> 07:57:35,570
I am ready to put on a show.

12762
07:57:36,290 --> 07:57:36,930
I...

12763
07:57:36,930 --> 07:57:37,650
Oh my god.

12764
07:57:49,930 --> 07:57:51,130
Oh my god.

12765
07:57:51,490 --> 07:57:52,330
There's more.

12766
07:57:52,690 --> 07:57:53,770
There's more.

12767
07:58:01,390 --> 07:58:02,670
There's more.

12768
07:58:04,850 --> 07:58:05,610
There's...

12769
07:58:09,090 --> 07:58:10,310
There's more.

12770
07:58:13,770 --> 07:58:14,530
There's...

12771
07:58:18,080 --> 07:58:18,840
There's...

12772
07:58:18,840 --> 07:58:20,980
There's more.

12773
07:58:22,850 --> 07:58:24,250
Oh my god.

12774
07:58:24,750 --> 07:58:26,030
There's more.

12775
07:58:26,850 --> 07:58:27,730
Oh my god.

12776
07:58:27,790 --> 07:58:29,070
Get me out of this game.

12777
07:58:29,890 --> 07:58:30,910
I'm sorry.

12778
07:58:31,050 --> 07:58:32,510
I'm like so stressed out.

12779
07:58:47,660 --> 07:58:48,220
Okay.

12780
07:58:52,200 --> 07:58:53,900
Oh my god, I don't know.

12781
07:58:54,540 --> 07:58:55,860
I don't know!

12782
07:58:58,360 --> 07:58:59,700
This is hell.

12783
07:59:13,760 --> 07:59:16,140
Oh my god, I have to focus so much.

12784
07:59:21,810 --> 07:59:23,010
This is so crazy.

12785
07:59:28,210 --> 07:59:30,410
Oh my god, okay.

12786
07:59:30,730 --> 07:59:32,430
I didn't think he would lose.

12787
07:59:32,810 --> 07:59:33,550
Oh my god.

12788
07:59:37,950 --> 07:59:39,770
Hello, I'm alive somehow.

12789
07:59:40,770 --> 07:59:41,430
Hello.

12790
07:59:43,230 --> 07:59:46,510
God, I have to like do extra flicks too.

12791
07:59:52,170 --> 07:59:53,990
What is going on?

12792
07:59:54,470 --> 07:59:56,730
What is going on?

12793
08:00:01,060 --> 08:00:03,460
What is... Oh my god!

12794
08:00:05,180 --> 08:00:07,180
Hello, I shall walk in here.

12795
08:00:14,310 --> 08:00:15,010
Jesus.

12796
08:00:16,870 --> 08:00:18,090
Oh my god.

12797
08:00:19,150 --> 08:00:21,420
I have to do my flicks so like...

12798
08:00:21,420 --> 08:00:21,980
Like...

12799
08:00:33,780 --> 08:00:37,360
Everybody's movement is so good, so it's even more... It's so hard.

12800
08:00:38,100 --> 08:00:39,560
You guys don't understand.

12801
08:00:40,280 --> 08:00:44,680
When everybody's movement is so good, it's like so hard to hit anything.

12802
08:00:45,100 --> 08:00:45,640
It's...

12803
08:00:48,580 --> 08:00:51,400
Especially when I have to like do like flicks and stuff.

12804
08:00:52,140 --> 08:00:53,160
Oh my god.

12805
08:00:53,820 --> 08:00:54,500
Oh my god.

12806
08:00:54,620 --> 08:00:57,140
No, no, I'm just so close!

12807
08:00:57,540 --> 08:00:57,820
No!

12808
08:00:59,020 --> 08:01:00,620
I need two more.

12809
08:01:01,360 --> 08:01:03,140
One, two, three.

12810
08:01:04,000 --> 08:01:05,480
Oh my god.

12811
08:01:06,000 --> 08:01:07,560
I needed two more hits.

12812
08:01:07,700 --> 08:01:09,060
I needed one more hit.

12813
08:01:17,420 --> 08:01:18,220
Jesus.

12814
08:01:18,220 --> 08:01:19,880
Oh my god.

12815
08:01:20,120 --> 08:01:20,320
Oh my god.

12816
08:01:20,320 --> 08:01:23,660
Our Loki did 64k healing.

12817
08:01:24,420 --> 08:01:25,680
Holy fuck.

12818
08:01:26,720 --> 08:01:27,800
He's a good play.

12819
08:01:27,960 --> 08:01:29,120
I don't... Oh my god.

12820
08:01:29,120 --> 08:01:33,180
I'm like... I've tried my best to keep up with everybody.

12821
08:01:33,660 --> 08:01:34,020
I...

12822
08:01:36,660 --> 08:01:40,300
I'm trying... I'm trying so hard to keep up.

12823
08:01:40,520 --> 08:01:43,020
But like... I would say...

12824
08:01:43,020 --> 08:01:46,380
The players here are really, really good.

12825
08:01:46,700 --> 08:01:49,060
They're all incredibly good.

12826
08:01:53,700 --> 08:01:54,460
Yeah.

12827
08:01:59,800 --> 08:02:03,660
No, this entire lobby was nearly top 500s.

12828
08:02:04,100 --> 08:02:07,240
And then um... And then... That play every day order and pro.

12829
08:02:08,440 --> 08:02:10,180
So it was such an intense game.

12830
08:02:10,320 --> 08:02:11,600
Like I was literally...

12831
08:02:11,600 --> 08:02:13,920
Had... I had to like predict and stuff.

12832
08:02:14,020 --> 08:02:15,480
Like I... I don't know if you guys noticed.

12833
08:02:15,760 --> 08:02:17,380
But like I was like flicking like crazy.

12834
08:02:17,720 --> 08:02:18,920
For my freezes.

12835
08:02:21,660 --> 08:02:22,540
Cause um...

12836
08:02:22,540 --> 08:02:25,200
I had to... Cause I had to predict where they might go.

12837
08:02:26,700 --> 08:02:28,420
It has three top 500 players.

12838
08:02:28,420 --> 08:02:30,440
Which hero do you think you wanna be today?

12839
08:02:30,960 --> 08:02:32,680
Well, well, well.

12840
08:02:33,020 --> 08:02:33,940
Well, well, well.

12841
08:02:33,940 --> 08:02:34,200
Well, well, well.

12842
08:02:34,400 --> 08:02:35,160
Wait, Korova.

12843
08:02:35,260 --> 08:02:35,720
Are you...

12844
08:02:35,720 --> 08:02:37,400
Wait, is Korova three stacking?

12845
08:02:38,080 --> 08:02:38,300
Yeah.

12846
08:02:38,800 --> 08:02:39,500
Oh my god.

12847
08:02:39,680 --> 08:02:41,300
I'm actually in like the...

12848
08:02:41,300 --> 08:02:42,060
Oh my god.

12849
08:02:43,160 --> 08:02:43,580
Oh my god.

12850
08:02:43,720 --> 08:02:45,740
I'm actually in like the super tri-hard.

12851
08:02:45,740 --> 08:02:46,820
Heartbreakers match.

12852
08:02:49,200 --> 08:02:49,760
What?

12853
08:02:51,380 --> 08:02:54,400
Your banter was so funny last game.

12854
08:02:54,700 --> 08:02:55,140
Yeah, I know.

12855
08:02:55,420 --> 08:02:55,620
I...

12856
08:02:56,300 --> 08:02:56,860
Like...

12857
08:02:56,860 --> 08:02:57,360
I used...

12858
08:02:57,360 --> 08:02:58,080
Okay, New Stone.

12859
08:02:58,400 --> 08:02:58,960
I... I've...

12860
08:02:58,960 --> 08:02:59,660
Yeah.

12861
08:03:00,980 --> 08:03:02,620
I used to be really fucking fat.

12862
08:03:03,480 --> 08:03:04,560
He gets the fat.

12863
08:03:04,840 --> 08:03:05,240
You know...

12864
08:03:05,240 --> 08:03:07,320
And that's 200 pounds when I was like 15.

12865
08:03:07,620 --> 08:03:07,820
Right?

12866
08:03:07,960 --> 08:03:11,000
I got made fun of so much for being like a chubby little...

12867
08:03:11,000 --> 08:03:11,660
Uh, little guy.

12868
08:03:11,980 --> 08:03:12,220
Right?

12869
08:03:12,220 --> 08:03:12,780
That...

12870
08:03:12,780 --> 08:03:13,680
I've like...

12871
08:03:14,620 --> 08:03:17,500
Entranked into my brain on how easy it is to make fat jokes.

12872
08:03:17,520 --> 08:03:18,100
Yeah, that's what I said.

12873
08:03:18,500 --> 08:03:18,920
No, no, no.

12874
08:03:18,920 --> 08:03:20,000
He spelled a...

12875
08:03:20,420 --> 08:03:23,720
He spelled your without an E, and I was gonna ask if he ate the E.

12876
08:03:25,940 --> 08:03:27,520
Cause like, I also...

12877
08:03:27,520 --> 08:03:27,960
That's good.

12878
08:03:28,360 --> 08:03:29,320
So like, fuck it.

12879
08:03:29,860 --> 08:03:30,480
I know the fat jokes.

12880
08:03:30,700 --> 08:03:30,720
Damn.

12881
08:03:31,080 --> 08:03:31,660
You muted.

12882
08:03:34,580 --> 08:03:35,220
That's pretty...

12883
08:03:35,220 --> 08:03:35,980
That's a good one.

12884
08:03:36,340 --> 08:03:36,900
That shit's good, is it not?

12885
08:03:37,320 --> 08:03:38,000
Oh, it is.

12886
08:03:38,180 --> 08:03:41,820
If he's on your team again, I'm gonna say don't eat the stones E's on your name.

12887
08:03:42,240 --> 08:03:43,120
I'm gonna do that.

12888
08:03:43,400 --> 08:03:44,840
What are your thoughts on mutants?

12889
08:03:45,460 --> 08:03:45,740
They are...

12890
08:03:45,740 --> 08:03:46,160
Do you hear one?

12891
08:03:46,420 --> 08:03:47,260
Like, I'm not judging.

12892
08:03:47,440 --> 08:03:49,120
Legally by definition people.

12893
08:03:49,520 --> 08:03:49,960
I counted seven before.

12894
08:03:50,160 --> 08:03:50,620
Why is there...

12895
08:03:50,620 --> 08:03:51,680
Why is there only six now?

12896
08:03:51,860 --> 08:03:52,280
I'm Luna Snow.

12897
08:03:53,040 --> 08:03:53,720
Like the moon.

12898
08:03:54,040 --> 08:03:57,040
I was giggling.

12899
08:03:57,280 --> 08:03:58,460
Nah, I was actually giggling all game.

12900
08:03:58,640 --> 08:03:59,140
Nah, I cooked.

12901
08:03:59,320 --> 08:03:59,460
I...

12902
08:03:59,460 --> 08:04:00,680
I cook up with those jokes.

12903
08:04:00,820 --> 08:04:01,020
I know.

12904
08:04:02,720 --> 08:04:04,400
Who's Kurovich three stacking with?

12905
08:04:04,640 --> 08:04:05,880
If people ain't laughing at that, then I'm just a dickhead.

12906
08:04:06,180 --> 08:04:07,900
No, I was a fat brown kid too.

12907
08:04:07,900 --> 08:04:10,020
And now I just really hate fat people.

12908
08:04:10,120 --> 08:04:10,400
Fat brown.

12909
08:04:12,500 --> 08:04:13,420
What the?

12910
08:04:13,820 --> 08:04:15,340
No, I actually hated myself.

12911
08:04:15,520 --> 08:04:16,860
I was a fat Mexican kid too.

12912
08:04:17,120 --> 08:04:18,720
And now I like actually hate fat people.

12913
08:04:19,000 --> 08:04:19,500
No, that's different.

12914
08:04:20,180 --> 08:04:21,480
No, that's different.

12915
08:04:22,300 --> 08:04:22,800
No, that's different.

12916
08:04:22,940 --> 08:04:23,260
Fat brown.

12917
08:04:36,860 --> 08:04:37,860
No, I...

12918
08:04:38,540 --> 08:04:39,760
I know how to make him funny.

12919
08:04:39,880 --> 08:04:41,000
What did he say?

12920
08:04:41,720 --> 08:04:42,420
I don't know.

12921
08:04:42,560 --> 08:04:43,860
I can't repeat it.

12922
08:04:44,520 --> 08:04:44,960
I...

12923
08:04:44,960 --> 08:04:47,040
Guys, I can't repeat that.

12924
08:04:47,040 --> 08:04:47,060
No, no, no.

12925
08:04:47,060 --> 08:04:47,500
I'm not malicious.

12926
08:04:47,740 --> 08:04:49,660
I just like think people should better themselves type shit.

12927
08:04:50,200 --> 08:04:52,320
I can't, I can't repeat it.

12928
08:04:52,840 --> 08:04:54,420
No, it's not actual hate.

12929
08:04:54,600 --> 08:04:55,360
No, it's not actual hate.

12930
08:04:55,620 --> 08:04:56,060
No.

12931
08:04:57,020 --> 08:04:58,380
I got too much love in my heart.

12932
08:04:59,140 --> 08:05:00,100
It helps you Hulk smash.

12933
08:05:00,460 --> 08:05:01,320
Like, fact check that.

12934
08:05:02,700 --> 08:05:03,280
Wait, what?

12935
08:05:03,880 --> 08:05:04,320
Yeah.

12936
08:05:05,560 --> 08:05:07,840
So, you know, I already said...

12937
08:05:07,840 --> 08:05:08,460
Because he's always angry?

12938
08:05:08,600 --> 08:05:08,980
He was lying.

12939
08:05:09,880 --> 08:05:11,400
You actually gotta have love in your heart.

12940
08:05:12,200 --> 08:05:13,720
Have love in your heart.

12941
08:05:14,280 --> 08:05:15,240
Don't trip res with read.

12942
08:05:17,540 --> 08:05:18,640
Oh, no matter.

12943
08:05:19,580 --> 08:05:20,920
They're on quad res, hold on.

12944
08:05:24,720 --> 08:05:25,400
You gonna bug me?

12945
08:05:25,520 --> 08:05:25,800
You gonna bug me?

12946
08:05:26,460 --> 08:05:26,720
Yeah.

12947
08:05:31,720 --> 08:05:33,320
They res, they both res, they both res.

12948
08:05:33,680 --> 08:05:34,560
Oh, over the res.

12949
08:05:35,060 --> 08:05:36,480
M1, M1, M1, M1, M1.

12950
08:05:36,480 --> 08:05:37,640
Okay, we're even.

12951
08:05:40,300 --> 08:05:41,060
I ain't gonna lie.

12952
08:05:41,100 --> 08:05:43,980
I'm gonna play M1 against that, but holy shit.

12953
08:05:44,160 --> 08:05:44,500
No, no.

12954
08:05:44,540 --> 08:05:45,480
Just go M1, just go M1.

12955
08:05:46,000 --> 08:05:46,980
Alright, you can go M1.

12956
08:05:47,340 --> 08:05:48,700
Oh, you're M1, M1, M1.

12957
08:05:55,300 --> 08:05:56,480
I can go back one and four.

12958
08:05:57,040 --> 08:05:57,560
I'm chilling right now.

12959
08:05:58,260 --> 08:05:58,460
Bro!

12960
08:05:58,940 --> 08:05:59,580
Fantastic half.

12961
08:06:00,060 --> 08:06:00,420
Holy...

12962
08:06:00,420 --> 08:06:01,640
Give me M1, M1, M1.

12963
08:06:01,700 --> 08:06:02,680
This dude will not die.

12964
08:06:05,480 --> 08:06:05,940
Mark at half.

12965
08:06:07,060 --> 08:06:07,780
Oh, we gotta shoot ban.

12966
08:06:08,540 --> 08:06:09,420
I'm gonna support.

12967
08:06:09,560 --> 08:06:09,900
I'm gonna support.

12968
08:06:09,900 --> 08:06:11,000
Alright, he's actually dead.

12969
08:06:11,240 --> 08:06:12,320
He's dead for real this time.

12970
08:06:12,400 --> 08:06:14,880
He's dead for real this time!

12971
08:06:22,480 --> 08:06:23,120
Whoa.

12972
08:06:29,020 --> 08:06:30,300
W-Elf!

12973
08:06:30,420 --> 08:06:30,900
Boat!

12974
08:06:38,600 --> 08:06:39,880
W-Elf!

12975
08:06:39,880 --> 08:06:40,000
Okay.

12976
08:06:40,340 --> 08:06:42,120
I'm hard to... Oh, no, I don't smoke.

12977
08:06:42,340 --> 08:06:42,780
I don't smoke.

12978
08:06:44,920 --> 08:06:45,740
No, I don't.

12979
08:06:46,540 --> 08:06:47,680
This guy's funny as fuck.

12980
08:06:48,480 --> 08:06:49,420
I would never say I'm strong.

12981
08:06:51,220 --> 08:06:52,380
What are my lobbies?

12982
08:06:52,640 --> 08:06:53,400
I live high.

12983
08:06:53,540 --> 08:06:53,980
You know what?

12984
08:06:54,100 --> 08:06:55,580
This is why I miss it highly though.

12985
08:06:56,960 --> 08:06:59,520
This is why I miss my high-lo lobbies.

12986
08:07:05,840 --> 08:07:07,060
Alright, that's awkward.

12987
08:07:10,640 --> 08:07:12,480
Let's get it.

12988
08:07:18,220 --> 08:07:20,340
No, no, I didn't.

12989
08:07:20,540 --> 08:07:23,080
No, I didn't get on in time.

12990
08:07:28,820 --> 08:07:30,680
Oh, they got the point.

12991
08:07:31,680 --> 08:07:33,660
We can't really use that Loki copy.

12992
08:07:33,960 --> 08:07:36,040
What is locked in?

12993
08:07:36,880 --> 08:07:37,580
Not bad.

12994
08:07:37,580 --> 08:07:38,640
But talking.

12995
08:07:39,060 --> 08:07:40,380
Welcome to high-elo.

12996
08:07:42,620 --> 08:07:45,860
They are skilled enough to be able to talk shit while...

12997
08:07:45,860 --> 08:07:46,340
Don't worry, don't worry.

12998
08:07:46,460 --> 08:07:47,300
...while they're playing.

12999
08:07:47,400 --> 08:07:48,220
What happened again, guys?

13000
08:07:49,300 --> 08:07:49,600
I don't know.

13001
08:07:49,740 --> 08:07:50,020
It's okay.

13002
08:07:50,200 --> 08:07:53,440
While playing in like high- High-elo environment.

13003
08:07:53,440 --> 08:07:54,400
I've been losing so much, bro.

13004
08:07:54,560 --> 08:07:55,700
I don't even want to know more.

13005
08:07:56,040 --> 08:07:58,600
It's been a while since I've played in this type of...

13006
08:07:58,600 --> 08:07:58,800
Elo.

13007
08:07:59,020 --> 08:07:59,360
I don't know.

13008
08:07:59,540 --> 08:08:00,960
I'm about to sleep again, bro.

13009
08:08:01,080 --> 08:08:01,620
I'm about to sleep.

13010
08:08:02,040 --> 08:08:02,580
I'm tired.

13011
08:08:02,900 --> 08:08:04,780
While streaming, so I'm like all over the place.

13012
08:08:04,880 --> 08:08:05,080
I'm tired.

13013
08:08:05,760 --> 08:08:11,080
Normally, I would be able to have a conversation and also like play really well.

13014
08:08:11,680 --> 08:08:14,460
But like it has been a while since I've played in this Elo.

13015
08:08:14,460 --> 08:08:15,510
I would...

13016
08:08:17,700 --> 08:08:19,500
So I'm like...

13017
08:08:19,500 --> 08:08:22,000
I'm trying to remember how to play.

13018
08:08:22,840 --> 08:08:23,600
You know?

13019
08:08:26,200 --> 08:08:28,300
Oh, that's unlucky.

13020
08:08:28,940 --> 08:08:29,900
That's unlucky.

13021
08:08:30,660 --> 08:08:31,380
That's unlucky.

13022
08:08:31,380 --> 08:08:31,620
That's unlucky.

13023
08:08:32,120 --> 08:08:33,160
I'm assuming you're reloading.

13024
08:08:33,780 --> 08:08:35,200
I hope that's what happened there.

13025
08:08:36,280 --> 08:08:38,280
I hit him three times.

13026
08:08:39,020 --> 08:08:40,100
I'm making a comeback.

13027
08:08:41,300 --> 08:08:43,000
So our team, we got this, I believe.

13028
08:08:43,580 --> 08:08:44,680
And not hit him?

13029
08:08:48,820 --> 08:08:50,460
Yeah, we know that so.

13030
08:08:51,060 --> 08:08:51,740
And not hit him?

13031
08:08:52,460 --> 08:08:53,640
I was healing him.

13032
08:08:53,660 --> 08:08:55,020
I just couldn't out-heal the damage.

13033
08:08:59,620 --> 08:09:01,560
I just didn't hit him all.

13034
08:09:02,040 --> 08:09:02,340
Did I?

13035
08:09:02,440 --> 08:09:02,820
I didn't know.

13036
08:09:03,280 --> 08:09:04,880
I can't tell if I missed.

13037
08:09:06,460 --> 08:09:07,220
Did I miss?

13038
08:09:07,740 --> 08:09:08,940
I know I hit him.

13039
08:09:24,350 --> 08:09:26,190
I have already- This is real!

13040
08:09:26,330 --> 08:09:27,130
That is so good.

13041
08:09:27,710 --> 08:09:28,890
I got this dog.

13042
08:09:28,890 --> 08:09:29,510
I'm ready to death.

13043
08:09:30,250 --> 08:09:30,570
Oh no.

13044
08:09:31,170 --> 08:09:34,010
I don't want to get all the healing I can get.

13045
08:09:36,070 --> 08:09:37,310
Who's behind you?

13046
08:09:37,670 --> 08:09:38,270
Who's behind me?

13047
08:09:38,270 --> 08:09:38,750
N00.

13048
08:09:41,670 --> 08:09:41,830
Oh no.

13049
08:09:43,710 --> 08:09:45,050
We saw the boys.

13050
08:09:45,050 --> 08:09:47,010
Oh my God.�...

13051
08:09:48,010 --> 08:09:48,630
Oh, no!

13052
08:09:48,830 --> 08:09:49,450
For it again!

13053
08:09:58,520 --> 08:09:59,040
Tryna.

13054
08:09:59,040 --> 08:10:01,260
Okay, what

13055
08:10:05,610 --> 08:10:06,470
are we doing here with the softer?

13056
08:10:08,330 --> 08:10:10,050
Oh my god, I have to reload!

13057
08:10:12,990 --> 08:10:15,730
I have to reload!

13058
08:10:15,950 --> 08:10:16,090
No!

13059
08:10:23,390 --> 08:10:23,830
Jesus!

13060
08:10:34,300 --> 08:10:35,360
Oh my god!

13061
08:10:37,840 --> 08:10:39,560
No, no, no, no, I got frozen!

13062
08:10:42,970 --> 08:10:43,920
I got frozen.

13063
08:10:46,440 --> 08:10:47,760
I'm so sad.

13064
08:10:51,080 --> 08:10:53,240
Oh, I had to touch point!

13065
08:11:02,620 --> 08:11:03,540
This is hell.

13066
08:11:04,220 --> 08:11:05,360
This is actual hell.

13067
08:11:07,620 --> 08:11:08,960
This is hell.

13068
08:11:08,960 --> 08:11:09,200
This is hell.

13069
08:11:09,200 --> 08:11:09,580
You got eye?

13070
08:11:10,180 --> 08:11:11,440
Eye unleashed!

13071
08:11:12,160 --> 08:11:12,420
Okay.

13072
08:11:12,860 --> 08:11:13,800
You fucking suck, bro.

13073
08:11:14,140 --> 08:11:14,800
I ain't out of here.

13074
08:11:15,380 --> 08:11:16,480
I ain't out of here.

13075
08:11:16,640 --> 08:11:32,540
I ain't out of here.

13076
08:11:32,540 --> 08:11:33,100
I got a healer, guys.

13077
08:11:34,380 --> 08:11:35,180
Oh my god.

13078
08:11:36,900 --> 08:11:37,340
Nooooo!

13079
08:11:40,430 --> 08:11:40,870
Bro!

13080
08:11:42,010 --> 08:11:43,850
No, he's just on me and Loki.

13081
08:11:44,290 --> 08:11:45,790
I can just, I can just solo him.

13082
08:11:45,950 --> 08:11:46,830
I can solo him on here.

13083
08:11:48,270 --> 08:11:48,590
No, no, no, no, no.

13084
08:11:48,590 --> 08:11:50,390
You'll have to keep fighting until we have a winner!

13085
08:11:52,070 --> 08:11:52,690
Jesus Christ.

13086
08:11:54,250 --> 08:11:55,550
What about, what about, what about, what about?

13087
08:11:56,390 --> 08:11:57,630
I don't think so.

13088
08:11:58,630 --> 08:11:58,950
Fuck.

13089
08:11:59,910 --> 08:12:01,910
No, no, no, I fucked up my ult, but like...

13090
08:12:02,530 --> 08:12:05,130
Nah, my, my like, first two ultimes was horrible.

13091
08:12:05,130 --> 08:12:06,530
I think just accomplish him.

13092
08:12:06,850 --> 08:12:08,410
I think, like, kinda accomplish him.

13093
08:12:08,610 --> 08:12:09,470
Yeah, I agree.

13094
08:12:10,870 --> 08:12:11,670
Oh my god.

13095
08:12:11,710 --> 08:12:14,270
That was like, a fight for 20 years.

13096
08:12:14,890 --> 08:12:16,370
Just pressure Adam, I think we win.

13097
08:12:16,490 --> 08:12:18,910
We had like, a 20 year fight there.

13098
08:12:19,090 --> 08:12:19,810
It was crazy.

13099
08:12:20,370 --> 08:12:22,290
That fight took so long.

13100
08:12:23,570 --> 08:12:23,730
Yeah.

13101
08:12:24,070 --> 08:12:26,350
I can play Rocket if we really want it, but...

13102
08:12:26,350 --> 08:12:26,930
It's up to you guys.

13103
08:12:28,270 --> 08:12:29,750
What, do we just trouble support?

13104
08:12:29,750 --> 08:12:29,970
Oh!

13105
08:12:31,890 --> 08:12:33,470
I mean, I got, I got...

13106
08:12:33,470 --> 08:12:36,030
Yeah, that was so cool.

13107
08:12:37,030 --> 08:12:38,170
Yeah, that was intense.

13108
08:12:38,690 --> 08:12:39,890
That was really intense.

13109
08:12:40,010 --> 08:12:41,390
You can get 50 for a support over there.

13110
08:12:41,550 --> 08:12:41,950
I'm like, boy.

13111
08:12:43,230 --> 08:12:44,110
Maybe we...

13112
08:12:44,110 --> 08:12:44,890
I'm doing it.

13113
08:12:45,030 --> 08:12:45,530
I'm doing it, you ready?

13114
08:12:45,770 --> 08:12:46,970
I'm trusting, I'm trusting.

13115
08:12:47,150 --> 08:12:47,410
Do it.

13116
08:12:48,350 --> 08:12:48,450
Ooh.

13117
08:12:51,490 --> 08:12:53,050
Alright, I'll go Mantis.

13118
08:12:54,510 --> 08:12:56,970
It's been 20 years since I played Mantis.

13119
08:12:58,550 --> 08:12:59,330
Let's do it.

13120
08:13:00,410 --> 08:13:01,790
Cause like, that guy's not done.

13121
08:13:02,230 --> 08:13:02,750
Focus who?

13122
08:13:03,330 --> 08:13:03,610
Fan.

13123
08:13:04,050 --> 08:13:04,410
Fan.

13124
08:13:06,330 --> 08:13:06,910
That's Reed.

13125
08:13:08,450 --> 08:13:09,490
That's Reed Richards, bro.

13126
08:13:10,750 --> 08:13:12,090
Hey, don't get the second Reed.

13127
08:13:13,050 --> 08:13:14,950
Oh my god, it's been so long.

13128
08:13:15,530 --> 08:13:17,170
Yo, I have a dark child, I'm gonna go fast.

13129
08:13:18,150 --> 08:13:18,830
Yeah, you can go for it.

13130
08:13:20,570 --> 08:13:20,890
Easy.

13131
08:13:22,390 --> 08:13:22,990
There we go.

13132
08:13:22,990 --> 08:13:23,930
This is real firepower.

13133
08:13:25,650 --> 08:13:26,550
There we go.

13134
08:13:26,630 --> 08:13:29,450
Looks like the mission area is yours to capture now.

13135
08:13:31,670 --> 08:13:32,630
Damn, like it's not.

13136
08:13:33,890 --> 08:13:34,950
Oh my god.

13137
08:13:35,430 --> 08:13:38,710
Might feel better already.

13138
08:13:39,030 --> 08:13:39,290
Oh.

13139
08:13:40,610 --> 08:13:41,650
Almost at the hole.

13140
08:13:44,190 --> 08:13:46,230
I am ready to put on a shield.

13141
08:13:46,230 --> 08:13:46,390
Oh.

13142
08:13:46,390 --> 08:13:46,830
Alright.

13143
08:13:49,720 --> 08:13:50,580
Oh, goodbye.

13144
08:13:51,100 --> 08:13:52,880
Oh my god, that was scary.

13145
08:14:00,490 --> 08:14:01,010
Oh.

13146
08:14:01,270 --> 08:14:02,110
I'm not lucky, girl.

13147
08:14:04,130 --> 08:14:04,650
Oh.

13148
08:14:05,750 --> 08:14:06,630
Oh, okay.

13149
08:14:07,270 --> 08:14:08,470
Can we do the...

13150
08:14:08,470 --> 08:14:09,810
Back at it again?

13151
08:14:11,110 --> 08:14:12,790
Yeah, Reed Richards are really fucking good.

13152
08:14:16,210 --> 08:14:16,610
Oh.

13153
08:14:17,750 --> 08:14:18,150
Oh.

13154
08:14:18,150 --> 08:14:20,110
I've not played Mantis in so long.

13155
08:14:20,450 --> 08:14:21,610
Maybe you would run out of Pluto.

13156
08:14:22,070 --> 08:14:22,470
Loki.

13157
08:14:22,690 --> 08:14:24,030
Yeah, Loki's terrible here.

13158
08:14:24,110 --> 08:14:24,830
I could have to do that.

13159
08:14:25,830 --> 08:14:26,790
I mean, I can swap.

13160
08:14:27,030 --> 08:14:27,290
It's fine.

13161
08:14:27,290 --> 08:14:27,830
I'll play Rocket.

13162
08:14:29,130 --> 08:14:29,830
No, no, no.

13163
08:14:29,950 --> 08:14:30,550
He's better than Rocket.

13164
08:14:30,670 --> 08:14:31,330
Better than Rocket.

13165
08:14:31,530 --> 08:14:31,830
Alright.

13166
08:14:34,870 --> 08:14:35,170
Ooh.

13167
08:14:35,570 --> 08:14:36,230
That's the one.

13168
08:14:36,750 --> 08:14:37,150
Alright.

13169
08:14:37,230 --> 08:14:37,950
Oh my god.

13170
08:14:39,110 --> 08:14:40,150
I cannot peek.

13171
08:14:42,910 --> 08:14:44,750
I cannot peek at all.

13172
08:14:45,030 --> 08:14:46,110
Oh my god.

13173
08:14:46,830 --> 08:14:48,090
I can't.

13174
08:14:48,370 --> 08:14:49,010
Jesus.

13175
08:14:58,730 --> 08:14:59,370
Oh.

13176
08:14:59,790 --> 08:14:59,910
Wait.

13177
08:15:00,010 --> 08:15:00,270
Goodbye.

13178
08:15:01,190 --> 08:15:02,170
Oh my god.

13179
08:15:02,250 --> 08:15:02,530
Please.

13180
08:15:05,450 --> 08:15:06,090
Jesus.

13181
08:15:06,110 --> 08:15:06,950
I don't know.

13182
08:15:07,850 --> 08:15:08,970
I don't know.

13183
08:15:08,970 --> 08:15:09,050
No.

13184
08:15:09,330 --> 08:15:10,430
What do we do?

13185
08:15:12,830 --> 08:15:14,270
Like, what do we do?

13186
08:15:14,570 --> 08:15:14,850
Oh.

13187
08:15:15,250 --> 08:15:16,270
Oh my god.

13188
08:15:16,490 --> 08:15:17,590
Get me out of here.

13189
08:15:20,710 --> 08:15:22,190
What do we do?

13190
08:15:24,650 --> 08:15:25,550
There we go.

13191
08:15:29,390 --> 08:15:29,910
Alright.

13192
08:15:30,610 --> 08:15:31,450
Do we keep fighting?

13193
08:15:32,590 --> 08:15:33,410
Do we go?

13194
08:15:34,970 --> 08:15:35,830
I don't know.

13195
08:15:37,090 --> 08:15:37,610
Okay.

13196
08:15:37,890 --> 08:15:38,730
I want it.

13197
08:15:38,730 --> 08:15:38,750
What?

13198
08:15:39,850 --> 08:15:41,070
I don't know.

13199
08:15:41,110 --> 08:15:41,690
What?

13200
08:15:42,550 --> 08:15:43,130
What?

13201
08:15:43,290 --> 08:15:44,230
What's going on?

13202
08:15:46,570 --> 08:15:48,050
What the fuck is...

13203
08:15:48,050 --> 08:15:49,190
I don't know.

13204
08:15:50,730 --> 08:15:53,330
I think everybody, like, gave up.

13205
08:15:57,130 --> 08:15:58,310
I think we all...

13206
08:15:58,310 --> 08:15:59,470
Our team just gave up.

13207
08:16:01,070 --> 08:16:01,730
What's over again?

13208
08:16:02,930 --> 08:16:03,230
Oh my god.

13209
08:16:03,610 --> 08:16:04,570
Oh my god.

13210
08:16:04,570 --> 08:16:04,710
Oh my god.

13211
08:16:04,990 --> 08:16:06,330
Oh my god.

13212
08:16:06,330 --> 08:16:08,690
This is real firepower!

13213
08:16:08,690 --> 08:16:10,610
We will be fast.

13214
08:16:11,010 --> 08:16:12,210
Brace us with victory!

13215
08:16:15,230 --> 08:16:17,470
I just think everybody just...

13216
08:16:17,470 --> 08:16:19,110
Collectively just stopped playing.

13217
08:16:26,260 --> 08:16:27,580
Oh my god.

13218
08:16:28,700 --> 08:16:29,120
GG.

13219
08:16:31,320 --> 08:16:33,000
Everyone literally just stopped.

13220
08:16:35,440 --> 08:16:37,240
This cop was not it.

13221
08:16:37,520 --> 08:16:40,280
Yeah, we just didn't know what to play for the cop.

13222
08:16:47,640 --> 08:16:48,700
Hey, but I hear you.

13223
08:16:48,700 --> 08:16:48,940
Healed.

13224
08:16:52,760 --> 08:16:53,580
Oh yeah, I know.

13225
08:16:53,700 --> 08:16:54,560
This was definitely...

13226
08:16:54,560 --> 08:16:54,700
Yeah.

13227
08:16:55,020 --> 08:16:56,340
This was definitely incredibly high elo.

13228
08:16:56,420 --> 08:16:57,440
That's why I didn't lose a lot.

13229
08:16:58,600 --> 08:16:59,880
I didn't lose a lot.

13230
08:17:00,580 --> 08:17:00,980
Because...

13231
08:17:02,540 --> 08:17:03,960
The elo was so high.

13232
08:17:06,580 --> 08:17:09,060
I was gonna say it had to be a really high lobby.

13233
08:17:10,040 --> 08:17:14,340
It had to be an incredibly high lobby for it to...

13234
08:17:15,160 --> 08:17:15,620
Uh...

13235
08:17:16,380 --> 08:17:17,980
For me to lose my 17.

13236
08:17:18,780 --> 08:17:19,600
I'm gonna get water.

13237
08:17:19,720 --> 08:17:20,200
I'll be right back.

13238
08:17:58,970 --> 08:18:00,360
My food's gonna be here...

13239
08:18:01,570 --> 08:18:02,030
And...

13240
08:18:03,970 --> 08:18:04,430
Um...

13241
08:18:09,480 --> 08:18:10,680
Why is it...

13242
08:18:10,680 --> 08:18:11,880
Is it cool if I play Emma?

13243
08:18:13,180 --> 08:18:13,640
What?

13244
08:18:14,820 --> 08:18:16,100
Oh, I was like, who said that?

13245
08:18:16,100 --> 08:18:16,260
I...

13246
08:18:16,260 --> 08:18:18,000
I kinda wanna play Emma.

13247
08:18:22,700 --> 08:18:23,180
Um...

13248
08:18:23,180 --> 08:18:23,880
What was I gonna say?

13249
08:18:24,120 --> 08:18:24,800
I forgot.

13250
08:18:25,920 --> 08:18:26,600
You know what?

13251
08:18:26,700 --> 08:18:27,200
That's fair.

13252
08:18:27,340 --> 08:18:27,980
I mean...

13253
08:18:27,980 --> 08:18:29,300
I could do a little mini...

13254
08:18:29,300 --> 08:18:32,120
I could do a mini Goodnight Dragons on the stream.

13255
08:18:32,960 --> 08:18:33,960
While I do my food...

13256
08:18:33,960 --> 08:18:34,420
While I eat.

13257
08:18:35,240 --> 08:18:37,020
I can talk with you guys.

13258
08:18:39,660 --> 08:18:41,060
It's like a hangout session.

13259
08:18:41,180 --> 08:18:41,900
It's like a mukbang.

13260
08:18:43,900 --> 08:18:45,240
I'll be here in 20 minutes.

13261
08:18:45,240 --> 08:18:46,300
Let me double check.

13262
08:18:54,070 --> 08:18:54,470
Uh...

13263
08:18:54,470 --> 08:18:56,270
JK, it'll be here in 30 minutes.

13264
08:18:58,570 --> 08:19:00,090
It'll be here in 30 minutes.

13265
08:19:03,110 --> 08:19:03,990
Oh wait, do we have...

13266
08:19:03,990 --> 08:19:05,010
Oh, we have three tank players.

13267
08:19:05,950 --> 08:19:06,270
Oh no.

13268
08:19:07,010 --> 08:19:07,930
No, no, it's not.

13269
08:19:08,210 --> 08:19:08,330
I don't know.

13270
08:19:08,490 --> 08:19:09,130
It's also that.

13271
08:19:10,370 --> 08:19:11,450
I just realized that.

13272
08:19:13,370 --> 08:19:14,250
I can go Hella.

13273
08:19:14,690 --> 08:19:15,630
No, no, no, I'll go Hella.

13274
08:19:15,990 --> 08:19:18,250
The right heroes could make all the difference.

13275
08:19:21,590 --> 08:19:21,950
Alright.

13276
08:19:23,790 --> 08:19:24,150
But...

13277
08:19:24,150 --> 08:19:25,450
I mean, I do have to eat.

13278
08:19:25,570 --> 08:19:27,130
So I won't be playing while I'm eating.

13279
08:19:27,310 --> 08:19:28,190
So I can hang out.

13280
08:19:32,990 --> 08:19:34,050
How have I been streaming?

13281
08:19:34,490 --> 08:19:34,570
Huh?

13282
08:19:35,050 --> 08:19:36,190
Wait, how have I been doing this?

13283
08:19:37,410 --> 08:19:38,250
Oh my god.

13284
08:19:38,970 --> 08:19:39,750
I don't know why.

13285
08:19:40,430 --> 08:19:40,750
It's...

13286
08:19:40,750 --> 08:19:42,030
Tokyo, you had a great time in the tournament.

13287
08:19:42,150 --> 08:19:42,350
Thank you.

13288
08:19:43,410 --> 08:19:43,990
Thank you.

13289
08:19:43,990 --> 08:19:44,570
Thank you, Rosie.

13290
08:19:44,990 --> 08:19:45,150
Yeah.

13291
08:19:45,410 --> 08:19:46,210
No, I had a great time.

13292
08:19:47,210 --> 08:19:47,530
Um...

13293
08:19:47,530 --> 08:19:48,230
It was just unlucky.

13294
08:19:48,710 --> 08:19:50,170
Um, but I really like my team.

13295
08:19:50,170 --> 08:19:52,390
I liked the people I was playing with.

13296
08:19:52,810 --> 08:19:54,910
Um, I got to like...

13297
08:19:54,910 --> 08:19:57,350
The only DPS I know is like...

13298
08:19:57,350 --> 08:20:00,630
Got to play with a lot of cool people today.

13299
08:20:02,530 --> 08:20:03,170
And, uh...

13300
08:20:03,890 --> 08:20:05,770
You know, got to hang out with a lot of cool people.

13301
08:20:07,450 --> 08:20:08,850
Got to know a lot of cool people.

13302
08:20:09,010 --> 08:20:10,970
I hope they thought I was cool and not annoying.

13303
08:20:11,870 --> 08:20:13,250
That's all I hope for.

13304
08:20:13,250 --> 08:20:14,290
Haha.

13305
08:20:15,670 --> 08:20:16,630
I hope...

13306
08:20:16,630 --> 08:20:17,690
I hope...

13307
08:20:17,690 --> 08:20:21,210
I hope people from their chat and, um...

13308
08:20:21,210 --> 08:20:23,250
You know, I hope the people themselves...

13309
08:20:23,810 --> 08:20:26,490
Thought I wasn't annoying and...

13310
08:20:26,490 --> 08:20:29,170
And it was fun to play with me too.

13311
08:20:29,990 --> 08:20:30,190
Haha.

13312
08:20:30,870 --> 08:20:32,950
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

13313
08:20:32,970 --> 08:20:34,410
That's all I hope for.

13314
08:20:35,370 --> 08:20:36,510
How do they resist?

13315
08:20:37,430 --> 08:20:38,450
I don't know.

13316
08:20:38,990 --> 08:20:41,090
That stupid chat is like...

13317
08:20:41,090 --> 08:20:42,350
Unpredictable for me.

13318
08:20:44,730 --> 08:20:45,590
I don't know.

13319
08:20:45,790 --> 08:20:48,230
I don't know if they...

13320
08:20:48,230 --> 08:20:49,530
I don't know if they...

13321
08:20:49,530 --> 08:20:50,350
It is that...

13322
08:20:52,890 --> 08:20:53,330
Whoa.

13323
08:20:53,930 --> 08:20:55,390
That scared me so I dropped down.

13324
08:20:56,150 --> 08:20:57,630
I got scared so I dropped down.

13325
08:20:57,830 --> 08:20:58,910
I hurt the side laugh.

13326
08:20:59,930 --> 08:21:00,710
No, no, no, no.

13327
08:21:12,400 --> 08:21:12,840
Oh.

13328
08:21:18,780 --> 08:21:19,520
Oh my god.

13329
08:21:20,880 --> 08:21:22,400
I don't like this fight at all.

13330
08:21:22,760 --> 08:21:23,200
Haha.

13331
08:21:24,520 --> 08:21:26,060
Not building ults.

13332
08:21:26,160 --> 08:21:27,180
As much as I like.

13333
08:21:34,070 --> 08:21:35,130
Oh no.

13334
08:21:38,570 --> 08:21:39,250
Woo!

13335
08:21:39,570 --> 08:21:40,130
No!

13336
08:21:41,530 --> 08:21:43,510
I felt the side lock too.

13337
08:21:44,630 --> 08:21:46,810
Oh, he killed our rocket as well.

13338
08:21:47,490 --> 08:21:48,050
Thank you.

13339
08:21:49,710 --> 08:21:51,010
I'm making a comeback.

13340
08:21:51,610 --> 08:21:52,050
I'm making a comeback.

13341
08:21:52,050 --> 08:21:52,470
Oh, fuck.

13342
08:21:52,570 --> 08:21:52,890
They got me.

13343
08:21:53,050 --> 08:21:53,370
Okay.

13344
08:21:59,310 --> 08:22:02,350
I don't know if I should give it to our side lock or...

13345
08:22:02,350 --> 08:22:03,570
I don't think we touch it.

13346
08:22:13,700 --> 08:22:15,640
I hope people like me.

13347
08:22:20,020 --> 08:22:21,640
I hope so too.

13348
08:22:22,860 --> 08:22:24,740
But I had a good time.

13349
08:22:25,180 --> 08:22:27,140
I personally had a good time.

13350
08:22:27,140 --> 08:22:28,140
You can all up first.

13351
08:22:28,920 --> 08:22:29,640
You can all up first.

13352
08:22:36,910 --> 08:22:40,490
I know that their side lock is gonna up.

13353
08:22:47,580 --> 08:22:49,460
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

13354
08:22:50,180 --> 08:22:50,580
No!

13355
08:22:52,580 --> 08:22:53,900
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

13356
08:22:54,920 --> 08:22:56,100
Oh, fuck.

13357
08:22:56,480 --> 08:22:56,620
Okay.

13358
08:22:57,320 --> 08:22:57,760
Not five.

13359
08:22:58,120 --> 08:22:59,880
I got hit by the thing.

13360
08:23:00,660 --> 08:23:01,700
That's unlucky.

13361
08:23:05,260 --> 08:23:06,300
I got hit.

13362
08:23:09,540 --> 08:23:11,520
Oh, I got hit by the cooldown.

13363
08:23:13,420 --> 08:23:14,420
That's so unlucky.

13364
08:23:14,480 --> 08:23:15,580
I got hit by the Emma.

13365
08:23:16,120 --> 08:23:16,700
Canceling thing.

13366
08:23:17,060 --> 08:23:18,840
So I couldn't cancel.

13367
08:23:19,560 --> 08:23:21,660
I wasn't able to press my Q.

13368
08:23:24,300 --> 08:23:25,320
That's so unlucky.

13369
08:23:27,640 --> 08:23:31,180
If like, if I wasn't like on the thing, I'd be able to pull it off.

13370
08:23:31,820 --> 08:23:32,760
I'm gonna put it on Earth.

13371
08:23:40,340 --> 08:23:42,320
Oh my god, I have to get out of position for that.

13372
08:23:42,320 --> 08:23:42,900
Okay.

13373
08:23:51,620 --> 08:23:52,400
Jesus Christ.

13374
08:23:52,420 --> 08:23:53,580
Oh my god, Jesus Christ.

13375
08:23:53,840 --> 08:23:54,740
He's alive.

13376
08:23:56,400 --> 08:23:57,260
He's alive!

13377
08:23:58,180 --> 08:23:59,840
Oh my god, he's alive!

13378
08:24:06,720 --> 08:24:08,220
Oh my god, okay.

13379
08:24:08,420 --> 08:24:08,700
We're fine.

13380
08:24:09,140 --> 08:24:09,400
We're fine.

13381
08:24:09,900 --> 08:24:12,640
No, the tournament ended a long time ago.

13382
08:24:12,840 --> 08:24:13,740
I'm just gaming.

13383
08:24:14,600 --> 08:24:14,780
I should...

13384
08:24:14,780 --> 08:24:15,400
I'll never push him.

13385
08:24:17,520 --> 08:24:18,480
Mag, where are you going?

13386
08:24:18,720 --> 08:24:20,140
You stop him in their trap!

13387
08:24:20,260 --> 08:24:20,700
Time cut.

13388
08:24:21,920 --> 08:24:22,840
Armor pack's here!

13389
08:24:23,240 --> 08:24:23,740
Pay him!

13390
08:24:27,400 --> 08:24:28,780
Wait, I want to make more damage.

13391
08:24:28,940 --> 08:24:29,860
Apparently, like...

13392
08:24:30,780 --> 08:24:32,800
I'm trying to do more damage, but...

13393
08:24:32,800 --> 08:24:32,920
Yeah.

13394
08:24:36,240 --> 08:24:36,600
That...

13395
08:24:36,600 --> 08:24:37,860
Oh my god, I have to...

13396
08:24:39,740 --> 08:24:40,460
Like, I...

13397
08:24:43,300 --> 08:24:44,140
That looks like half.

13398
08:24:46,900 --> 08:24:47,800
Oh my god, we did it.

13399
08:24:48,840 --> 08:24:49,600
No!

13400
08:24:49,800 --> 08:24:50,120
No!

13401
08:24:50,360 --> 08:24:50,520
No!

13402
08:24:50,660 --> 08:24:50,740
No!

13403
08:24:50,840 --> 08:24:51,120
Not again!

13404
08:24:51,460 --> 08:24:51,640
Oh!

13405
08:24:52,640 --> 08:24:54,020
Couldn't press Q!

13406
08:24:56,800 --> 08:24:58,080
Jesus Christ.

13407
08:24:58,760 --> 08:25:00,560
I couldn't press Q again.

13408
08:25:00,980 --> 08:25:02,360
I'm so sad.

13409
08:25:03,720 --> 08:25:05,820
I literally pressed it too.

13410
08:25:07,000 --> 08:25:07,760
Again!

13411
08:25:10,020 --> 08:25:11,620
I'm so sad.

13412
08:25:11,760 --> 08:25:12,520
Every time!

13413
08:25:13,000 --> 08:25:13,880
I literally...

13414
08:25:14,380 --> 08:25:15,420
Oh my god.

13415
08:25:16,040 --> 08:25:17,100
That sucks.

13416
08:25:20,460 --> 08:25:21,440
That actually sucks.

13417
08:25:22,880 --> 08:25:26,020
I feel like I low-key through that part... that fight.

13418
08:25:33,100 --> 08:25:34,700
Yeah, Rocket saved it.

13419
08:25:35,480 --> 08:25:36,120
Our Rocket's good.

13420
08:25:36,120 --> 08:25:37,820
I don't have to be center stage.

13421
08:25:38,000 --> 08:25:38,380
Oh!

13422
08:25:39,320 --> 08:25:39,840
Every time!

13423
08:25:40,060 --> 08:25:43,880
They ult it, and I pressed Q, but like, it didn't go off.

13424
08:25:44,080 --> 08:25:44,880
I don't know why.

13425
08:25:46,300 --> 08:25:48,060
Did they use Rocket, or...

13426
08:25:48,060 --> 08:25:48,520
Did they have that?

13427
08:25:48,580 --> 08:25:49,460
Like, her...

13428
08:25:49,460 --> 08:25:51,740
Like, I pressed Q, but it was just too late.

13429
08:25:56,390 --> 08:25:57,250
Yeah, I...

13430
08:25:57,250 --> 08:25:58,530
It stops cooldowns.

13431
08:25:58,610 --> 08:25:59,550
Like, I can't use any...

13432
08:25:59,550 --> 08:26:03,470
Basically, what Emma does, is that I can't use any abilities.

13433
08:26:17,560 --> 08:26:19,440
Oh no, we couldn't help each other.

13434
08:26:24,950 --> 08:26:26,610
Yeah, it silences you.

13435
08:26:26,830 --> 08:26:29,250
So when it silences you, you literally can't do anything.

13436
08:26:36,340 --> 08:26:38,960
Yeah, there's like nothing I can do about it too, which sucks.

13437
08:26:42,470 --> 08:26:42,890
Oh.

13438
08:26:43,910 --> 08:26:44,470
You're

13439
08:26:49,100 --> 08:26:49,440
welcome.

13440
08:26:49,460 --> 08:26:50,720
Cause I pressed...

13441
08:26:50,720 --> 08:26:53,000
Tried to press Q, but it didn't activate.

13442
08:26:54,700 --> 08:26:57,420
It even gave me a little animation too, before it canceled.

13443
08:26:58,060 --> 08:26:58,160
It's okay.

13444
08:26:58,440 --> 08:26:59,600
A nice deep freeze.

13445
08:27:01,500 --> 08:27:02,180
No rig.

13446
08:27:12,160 --> 08:27:14,300
I am ready to put on a show!

13447
08:27:16,840 --> 08:27:17,700
Any reload.

13448
08:27:22,530 --> 08:27:23,790
Got it, this time.

13449
08:27:24,150 --> 08:27:25,550
I reacted in time.

13450
08:27:26,250 --> 08:27:27,270
Oh my god.

13451
08:27:27,350 --> 08:27:28,250
I reacted in time.

13452
08:27:28,430 --> 08:27:28,930
Thank God.

13453
08:27:29,910 --> 08:27:31,610
Only 60 seconds left.

13454
08:27:32,390 --> 08:27:34,610
Thank God I reacted in time for it.

13455
08:27:34,730 --> 08:27:35,070
This...

13456
08:27:35,070 --> 08:27:35,170
No!

13457
08:27:35,710 --> 08:27:36,130
Oh.

13458
08:27:36,450 --> 08:27:37,030
Still out of juice.

13459
08:27:37,110 --> 08:27:37,570
My bad.

13460
08:27:42,460 --> 08:27:42,980
Oh!

13461
08:27:44,180 --> 08:27:46,020
Finally, I reacted in time!

13462
08:27:46,380 --> 08:27:46,580
Nope.

13463
08:27:49,600 --> 08:27:51,180
A rocket skin doesn't, guys.

13464
08:28:06,520 --> 08:28:09,060
Oh, I'm trying so hard to focus.

13465
08:28:09,320 --> 08:28:09,480
No!

13466
08:28:13,120 --> 08:28:14,140
I hear him.

13467
08:28:14,580 --> 08:28:16,240
I hear him go Sayonara.

13468
08:28:19,600 --> 08:28:21,540
I hear him go Sayonara.

13469
08:28:25,560 --> 08:28:27,980
Oh my god, high ELO player movements are so good.

13470
08:28:28,300 --> 08:28:29,940
They're so hard to hit sometimes.

13471
08:28:30,360 --> 08:28:36,640
Oh my god, they're so hard to hit.

13472
08:28:38,760 --> 08:28:42,220
High ELO players, they move so much.

13473
08:28:47,500 --> 08:28:50,360
Like, Jesus Christ, you see their movement?

13474
08:28:50,580 --> 08:28:51,460
I have to like...

13475
08:28:51,460 --> 08:28:54,820
The thing is, as a support, you have to be able to predict where they're gonna go.

13476
08:28:55,280 --> 08:28:56,520
You have to be like...

13477
08:28:57,020 --> 08:28:57,480
You have to be...

13478
08:28:57,480 --> 08:29:00,860
Because like, they move so that people won't hit them.

13479
08:29:01,040 --> 08:29:04,660
But then it's even harder for the support to hit them too.

13480
08:29:05,260 --> 08:29:10,300
So, they have to move in a way that's unpredictable to the enemy team.

13481
08:29:11,560 --> 08:29:13,980
But it's unpredictable to me too.

13482
08:29:18,920 --> 08:29:19,960
This movement...

13483
08:29:23,560 --> 08:29:27,580
Tournament-wise, placing, we got 5th, 6th, which is like...

13484
08:29:27,580 --> 08:29:28,640
We got knocked out.

13485
08:29:28,860 --> 08:29:30,500
We did really well at Round Robin.

13486
08:29:30,660 --> 08:29:33,160
We were like 3rd place in Round Robin.

13487
08:29:33,360 --> 08:29:36,640
But they made the thing single elimination.

13488
08:29:37,620 --> 08:29:43,420
And in Round Robin, the team researched us.

13489
08:29:43,420 --> 08:29:44,620
The team like, watched...

13490
08:29:44,620 --> 08:29:47,280
I'm pretty sure the team just researched us and looked through VODs.

13491
08:29:47,320 --> 08:29:48,480
To see what we were playing.

13492
08:29:48,880 --> 08:29:49,560
They didn't know exactly...

13493
08:29:50,000 --> 08:29:50,580
Because we would say...

13494
08:29:50,940 --> 08:29:52,520
We were talking about like, you know...

13495
08:29:52,520 --> 08:29:53,740
We didn't do that.

13496
08:29:54,000 --> 08:29:55,200
We didn't watch the stream.

13497
08:29:55,500 --> 08:29:56,700
Of like, how...

13498
08:29:57,240 --> 08:29:57,640
The...

13499
08:29:57,640 --> 08:29:59,940
And we would like, say like...

13500
08:29:59,940 --> 08:30:02,300
Oh, our weakest players are black.

13501
08:30:02,700 --> 08:30:03,640
And like...

13502
08:30:03,640 --> 08:30:05,640
Oh, like this is what they can only play.

13503
08:30:05,640 --> 08:30:06,640
So they target banned...

13504
08:30:07,360 --> 08:30:07,800
Uh...

13505
08:30:07,800 --> 08:30:08,700
Our weakest players.

13506
08:30:14,950 --> 08:30:15,610
Oh, I...

13507
08:30:15,610 --> 08:30:16,790
I fucked up.

13508
08:30:16,930 --> 08:30:18,410
I'm supposed to give this to our Psylocke.

13509
08:30:19,450 --> 08:30:21,210
Our Psylocke is supposed to have...

13510
08:30:25,900 --> 08:30:26,340
Yeah.

13511
08:30:31,850 --> 08:30:34,650
And we didn't have time to actually like...

13512
08:30:35,670 --> 08:30:36,110
Uh...

13513
08:30:37,830 --> 08:30:39,510
And we didn't know what to do for that.

13514
08:30:40,490 --> 08:30:41,410
Oh my god, please.

13515
08:30:43,450 --> 08:30:43,930
Nice.

13516
08:30:49,600 --> 08:30:50,960
I hear the Psylocke.

13517
08:30:54,740 --> 08:30:55,020
Nice.

13518
08:30:56,480 --> 08:30:57,820
Gotta save our Psy.

13519
08:30:58,940 --> 08:30:59,420
Nice.

13520
08:30:59,600 --> 08:30:59,760
Alright.

13521
08:31:02,180 --> 08:31:03,040
Yeah, it is...

13522
08:31:03,040 --> 08:31:03,520
I had fun.

13523
08:31:03,680 --> 08:31:04,880
I got to play with Tide at once.

13524
08:31:05,240 --> 08:31:05,760
So I had fun.

13525
08:31:07,780 --> 08:31:10,140
I know that's like always the thing I bring up.

13526
08:31:10,300 --> 08:31:11,600
But honestly, like...

13527
08:31:11,600 --> 08:31:14,320
It's such a crazy experience in general for me.

13528
08:31:15,000 --> 08:31:15,500
You know?

13529
08:31:17,500 --> 08:31:17,900
Like...

13530
08:31:17,900 --> 08:31:18,300
Three on.

13531
08:31:18,440 --> 08:31:18,700
Three on.

13532
08:31:18,800 --> 08:31:19,000
Three on.

13533
08:31:19,120 --> 08:31:20,520
They just lift themselves back so hard.

13534
08:31:23,220 --> 08:31:24,520
And I keep bringing it up.

13535
08:31:24,600 --> 08:31:25,400
But it's like...

13536
08:31:25,400 --> 08:31:27,760
I don't think I'll ever get that opportunity again.

13537
08:31:28,740 --> 08:31:29,620
And it's like...

13538
08:31:29,620 --> 08:31:30,620
Someone I've like never...

13539
08:31:31,080 --> 08:31:32,580
You know, I've watched a lot.

13540
08:31:33,280 --> 08:31:34,000
In the past.

13541
08:31:34,000 --> 08:31:34,620
Not anymore.

13542
08:31:34,880 --> 08:31:35,440
But like...

13543
08:31:35,440 --> 08:31:35,560
You know?

13544
08:31:35,860 --> 08:31:38,740
He's been around the internet for a long time.

13545
08:31:38,880 --> 08:31:39,840
Like 10 plus years?

13546
08:31:40,120 --> 08:31:41,820
He's been a streamer for 10 plus years.

13547
08:31:46,010 --> 08:32:00,150
He's been a streamer for 10 plus years.

13548
08:32:02,410 --> 08:32:04,290
I should've kept the...

13549
08:32:08,300 --> 08:32:09,260
I should've kept the...

13550
08:32:09,260 --> 08:32:10,040
I should've kept it on...

13551
08:32:15,700 --> 08:32:16,520
I might be dead.

13552
08:32:17,320 --> 08:32:17,880
Whoa!

13553
08:32:18,240 --> 08:32:18,700
JK!

13554
08:32:19,880 --> 08:32:20,400
Other...

13555
08:32:20,400 --> 08:32:21,760
My team will be dead though.

13556
08:32:22,460 --> 08:32:23,060
Unless...

13557
08:32:23,680 --> 08:32:24,540
Oh no, I'm dead.

13558
08:32:25,940 --> 08:32:26,540
100%.

13559
08:32:47,580 --> 08:32:50,480
I'm just gonna put this on...

13560
08:32:57,690 --> 08:32:58,350
Uh...

13561
08:32:58,350 --> 08:32:59,410
I'm gonna put it on our Psyloc.

13562
08:33:00,430 --> 08:33:01,450
Then she's flanking.

13563
08:33:08,410 --> 08:33:09,350
Oh my god.

13564
08:33:09,350 --> 08:33:10,590
I'm A.

13565
08:33:12,070 --> 08:33:13,230
Get me reload.

13566
08:33:16,070 --> 08:33:17,310
Holy shit.

13567
08:33:17,970 --> 08:33:18,770
This...

13568
08:33:18,770 --> 08:33:20,450
Fucking Psyloc flanking every time.

13569
08:33:21,030 --> 08:33:21,930
After like...

13570
08:33:21,930 --> 08:33:22,170
Oh yeah.

13571
08:33:22,290 --> 08:33:23,550
She's so aware.

13572
08:33:23,890 --> 08:33:25,410
Of like...

13573
08:33:25,410 --> 08:33:26,070
The footsteps.

13574
08:33:26,430 --> 08:33:28,090
OH MY GOD, Emma!

13575
08:33:30,450 --> 08:33:33,090
OH MY GOD, okay.

13576
08:33:33,350 --> 08:33:34,530
You guys die too fast.

13577
08:33:36,890 --> 08:33:38,890
You guys died so fast!

13578
08:33:52,030 --> 08:33:52,550
Alright.

13579
08:33:52,550 --> 08:33:54,650
Here's the... My ping?

13580
08:33:54,850 --> 08:33:55,730
No, it's just East Coast.

13581
08:33:56,490 --> 08:33:58,290
Majority of the servers are in East Coast.

13582
08:33:58,990 --> 08:34:02,530
Majority of the players in high elo are in East Coast, unfortunately.

13583
08:34:02,930 --> 08:34:08,710
So, like, my ping is always, like, just how I have to live.

13584
08:34:09,710 --> 08:34:10,570
Jesus Christ.

13585
08:34:11,170 --> 08:34:11,310
Okay.

13586
08:34:14,150 --> 08:34:18,150
Oh my... Oh my god!

13587
08:34:18,590 --> 08:34:21,590
How is everybody getting deleted so fast?

13588
08:34:24,630 --> 08:34:25,910
Hello, everyone.

13589
08:34:26,030 --> 08:34:26,970
Can we all stack together?

13590
08:34:34,580 --> 08:34:35,560
Alright.

13591
08:34:35,560 --> 08:34:36,880
We're up there, folks.

13592
08:34:38,180 --> 08:34:38,580
Alright.

13593
08:34:41,300 --> 08:34:43,180
Oh, they have a rocket, too, so it's not that.

13594
08:34:46,160 --> 08:34:46,640
But...

13595
08:34:46,640 --> 08:34:48,880
That... They got deleted so fucking fast.

13596
08:34:49,040 --> 08:34:49,540
That's crazy.

13597
08:34:58,120 --> 08:34:59,000
Tala's always behind.

13598
08:34:59,240 --> 08:35:00,080
When is she not?

13599
08:35:07,350 --> 08:35:08,110
A lot first.

13600
08:35:13,450 --> 08:35:14,110
Okay, wait.

13601
08:35:16,870 --> 08:35:17,330
Okay.

13602
08:35:18,050 --> 08:35:18,510
Nice.

13603
08:35:18,870 --> 08:35:19,330
Alright.

13604
08:35:19,990 --> 08:35:21,350
I had to use that.

13605
08:35:24,570 --> 08:35:26,730
Oh, I had to use it or I'd die.

13606
08:35:30,910 --> 08:35:32,310
Oh, they have one more fight, though.

13607
08:35:36,400 --> 08:35:36,860
Ooh.

13608
08:35:41,670 --> 08:35:42,130
Nice.

13609
08:35:42,690 --> 08:35:43,150
Nice.

13610
08:35:43,370 --> 08:35:43,530
Okay.

13611
08:35:44,730 --> 08:35:46,910
Now we have to push halfway.

13612
08:35:49,570 --> 08:35:50,850
I'm glad we dodged it.

13613
08:35:51,410 --> 08:35:52,610
I got scared.

13614
08:35:58,170 --> 08:36:00,570
I'm glad we dodged death.

13615
08:36:01,470 --> 08:36:02,530
We dodged fear.

13616
08:36:03,810 --> 08:36:05,470
My number one fear.

13617
08:36:05,670 --> 08:36:05,990
Fear.

13618
08:36:17,900 --> 08:36:19,160
Oh, he has...

13619
08:36:19,160 --> 08:36:20,760
He has the mind control.

13620
08:36:24,800 --> 08:36:26,180
I know she has...

13621
08:36:26,180 --> 08:36:27,160
She's looking for it, too.

13622
08:36:29,120 --> 08:36:29,820
There we go.

13623
08:36:30,040 --> 08:36:30,440
Nia!

13624
08:36:31,760 --> 08:36:32,880
Oh, looking at me.

13625
08:36:33,820 --> 08:36:34,300
Oh!

13626
08:36:34,780 --> 08:36:35,260
Goodbye.

13627
08:36:41,850 --> 08:36:42,650
It's unlucky.

13628
08:36:44,050 --> 08:36:46,730
I didn't realize our rocket was getting targeted.

13629
08:36:47,330 --> 08:36:50,330
I have to be, like, so hyper-aware of the side-lock, too.

13630
08:36:51,250 --> 08:36:52,650
It's just you up there, son.

13631
08:36:54,090 --> 08:36:54,610
Whoa.

13632
08:36:55,190 --> 08:36:55,750
That's close.

13633
08:36:56,190 --> 08:36:58,010
That one hit actually saved him.

13634
08:37:00,230 --> 08:37:01,870
Alright, let's just tackle through that.

13635
08:37:07,340 --> 08:37:07,860
Nice.

13636
08:37:08,200 --> 08:37:08,860
Two healers down.

13637
08:37:10,800 --> 08:37:11,720
Okay, nice!

13638
08:37:12,920 --> 08:37:15,320
Three, three, three, three, three!

13639
08:37:15,600 --> 08:37:16,460
Oh, my God!

13640
08:37:16,720 --> 08:37:17,960
Where did she come from?

13641
08:37:18,160 --> 08:37:18,380
Three!

13642
08:37:18,890 --> 08:37:19,840
And the catch!

13643
08:37:20,760 --> 08:37:21,700
Jesus Christ!

13644
08:37:21,940 --> 08:37:22,080
Yay!

13645
08:37:22,720 --> 08:37:23,480
Nice, GG, guys.

13646
08:37:23,980 --> 08:37:24,160
Yay!

13647
08:37:25,160 --> 08:37:27,280
One, four, three, two, two!

13648
08:37:28,120 --> 08:37:30,840
Yo, the coordination is crazy from the enemy team.

13649
08:37:31,240 --> 08:37:33,220
He says, as they all died.

13650
08:37:35,000 --> 08:37:36,060
Good timing.

13651
08:37:36,520 --> 08:37:37,240
Good timing.

13652
08:37:49,350 --> 08:37:49,930
Yay!

13653
08:37:54,590 --> 08:37:56,160
I'm surprised I didn't do that much healing.

13654
08:37:57,940 --> 08:37:59,160
I guess, like...

13655
08:37:59,160 --> 08:37:59,760
Oh, my gosh.

13656
08:37:59,900 --> 08:38:00,620
Actually, I don't know.

13657
08:38:01,440 --> 08:38:02,780
I guess we died too fast?

13658
08:38:03,560 --> 08:38:04,980
I didn't get that much healing.

13659
08:38:06,080 --> 08:38:07,840
I guess it's because of the side-lock, too.

13660
08:38:08,020 --> 08:38:09,820
Okay, I'm just checking the food real quick.

13661
08:38:13,300 --> 08:38:15,840
I'm just making sure the food...

13662
08:38:16,780 --> 08:38:17,920
Uh, gets...

13663
08:38:17,920 --> 08:38:18,700
Okay, nice.

13664
08:38:19,240 --> 08:38:20,980
Just making sure about the food.

13665
08:38:23,020 --> 08:38:23,900
No, uh...

13666
08:38:23,900 --> 08:38:25,720
Uh...

13667
08:38:26,440 --> 08:38:29,740
No, it got pushed up because we're waiting for...

13668
08:38:30,940 --> 08:38:31,460
No.

13669
08:38:33,980 --> 08:38:35,020
I'm...

13670
08:38:35,020 --> 08:38:37,120
I'm combining it...

13671
08:38:37,120 --> 08:38:38,460
...with this one.

13672
08:38:43,400 --> 08:38:45,600
When I get food...

13673
08:38:49,960 --> 08:38:50,360
Yay!

13674
08:38:51,520 --> 08:38:52,980
No, it's gonna be here in 30 minutes.

13675
08:38:56,660 --> 08:38:57,580
Yeah, but don't worry.

13676
08:38:57,680 --> 08:38:58,460
We'll have a goodnight dra...

13677
08:38:58,460 --> 08:39:00,480
Like, an actual goodnight dragoons tomorrow.

13678
08:39:03,020 --> 08:39:04,380
But we'll have a mini one here.

13679
08:39:09,580 --> 08:39:10,800
No, it's like...

13680
08:39:10,800 --> 08:39:11,300
Uh...

13681
08:39:11,300 --> 08:39:12,640
Well, I have to eat anyway.

13682
08:39:12,980 --> 08:39:13,380
So...

13683
08:39:17,960 --> 08:39:18,800
I have to eat.

13684
08:39:19,180 --> 08:39:19,240
I have to eat.

13685
08:39:19,240 --> 08:39:19,900
So I'm just gonna wait.

13686
08:39:20,040 --> 08:39:21,500
I'm just gonna play until my food's here.

13687
08:39:22,800 --> 08:39:24,340
And then we'll relax together.

13688
08:39:28,090 --> 08:39:29,390
So we'll have it, like, tomorrow.

13689
08:39:43,540 --> 08:39:43,840
Yeah.

13690
08:39:45,660 --> 08:39:47,340
So we're just having a mini one here.

13691
08:39:47,600 --> 08:39:48,240
Since I'm gonna...

13692
08:39:48,240 --> 08:39:49,000
I have to eat anyway.

13693
08:39:49,240 --> 08:39:50,840
So I might as well just hang out with you guys while I eat.

13694
08:39:57,620 --> 08:39:59,800
Ugh, I think my brain is, like, brain-rotted.

13695
08:40:02,660 --> 08:40:03,860
It's like...

13696
08:40:03,860 --> 08:40:05,700
It's like actually...

13697
08:40:05,700 --> 08:40:06,300
Oh, nice.

13698
08:40:06,960 --> 08:40:07,620
It's like...

13699
08:40:07,620 --> 08:40:08,580
Rivals brain-rotted.

13700
08:40:08,580 --> 08:40:09,500
I told you guys.

13701
08:40:11,300 --> 08:40:12,480
I was okay.

13702
08:40:12,880 --> 08:40:13,260
Like...

13703
08:40:13,260 --> 08:40:15,460
I actually did not play a lot of Rivals.

13704
08:40:15,880 --> 08:40:17,260
For the longest time.

13705
08:40:17,580 --> 08:40:19,400
Until I played Rivals today.

13706
08:40:19,760 --> 08:40:20,640
For the tournament.

13707
08:40:21,280 --> 08:40:22,360
And then I...

13708
08:40:22,360 --> 08:40:22,600
I...

13709
08:40:22,600 --> 08:40:23,760
It always does that.

13710
08:40:23,920 --> 08:40:25,440
I would go, like, cold turkey.

13711
08:40:25,740 --> 08:40:27,120
And then it hits me.

13712
08:40:27,660 --> 08:40:28,060
And...

13713
08:40:31,440 --> 08:40:32,720
It fucking...

13714
08:40:33,400 --> 08:40:34,740
It fucking hits me.

13715
08:40:35,220 --> 08:40:38,400
Now, who am I gonna banish from this match?

13716
08:40:41,300 --> 08:40:42,400
No, not really.

13717
08:40:45,220 --> 08:40:45,860
Um...

13718
08:40:45,860 --> 08:40:47,800
Because after today, I'd be...

13719
08:40:47,800 --> 08:40:48,200
I...

13720
08:40:48,200 --> 08:40:49,420
I'll return back to normal.

13721
08:40:50,780 --> 08:40:52,800
After today, I just return back to normal.

13722
08:40:52,800 --> 08:40:53,980
It's just because, like...

13723
08:40:54,540 --> 08:40:54,900
You know...

13724
08:40:54,900 --> 08:40:56,660
Obviously, this is my therapy session.

13725
08:40:56,960 --> 08:40:58,460
Right now, with Mr...

13726
08:40:58,460 --> 08:40:59,060
Dr. Rivals.

13727
08:40:59,440 --> 08:41:00,360
And, like...

13728
08:41:00,360 --> 08:41:01,740
You know, I gotta get all my...

13729
08:41:01,740 --> 08:41:02,760
Aggression out.

13730
08:41:02,900 --> 08:41:03,060
You know?

13731
08:41:05,460 --> 08:41:06,060
With...

13732
08:41:06,060 --> 08:41:07,360
With Dr. Rivals.

13733
08:41:08,780 --> 08:41:09,520
M.D.

13734
08:41:29,780 --> 08:41:30,920
And, I'm having fun.

13735
08:41:32,960 --> 08:41:34,060
And, I'm having fun.

13736
08:41:34,240 --> 08:41:35,800
I hope you guys are having fun, too.

13737
08:41:39,380 --> 08:41:40,340
And, normally...

13738
08:41:40,340 --> 08:41:41,140
This is, like...

13739
08:41:41,140 --> 08:41:41,580
I don't know.

13740
08:41:42,520 --> 08:41:44,540
Shooter games are, like, the only games that, like...

13741
08:41:44,540 --> 08:41:46,120
Get me into, like...

13742
08:41:46,120 --> 08:41:48,480
Streaming for super long periods of time.

13743
08:41:49,720 --> 08:41:50,720
I don't know why.

13744
08:41:56,360 --> 08:41:58,320
Like, I can actually play for so long.

13745
08:41:59,320 --> 08:41:59,640
Just...

13746
08:41:59,640 --> 08:42:00,860
Primarily, just...

13747
08:42:00,860 --> 08:42:01,400
Shooter games.

13748
08:42:02,740 --> 08:42:04,980
I don't know about our team right now.

13749
08:42:06,200 --> 08:42:06,740
I...

13750
08:42:07,190 --> 08:42:09,500
I definitely don't know about our team right now.

13751
08:42:22,210 --> 08:42:23,670
I mean, turn off brain...

13752
08:42:24,130 --> 08:42:24,610
And, just shoot.

13753
08:42:24,830 --> 08:42:25,110
Pew pew.

13754
08:42:25,710 --> 08:42:26,230
Pew pew.

13755
08:42:27,230 --> 08:42:28,190
Pew pew.

13756
08:42:29,690 --> 08:42:30,250
Wait,

13757
08:42:34,690 --> 08:42:35,190
who do I want?

13758
08:42:35,390 --> 08:42:35,950
Hello?

13759
08:42:36,470 --> 08:42:37,170
Oh, no.

13760
08:42:37,450 --> 08:42:37,770
Wolverine.

13761
08:42:37,950 --> 08:42:38,930
Hello, Wolverine.

13762
08:42:42,250 --> 08:42:42,990
Oh, yeah.

13763
08:42:45,730 --> 08:42:46,750
Oh, that's bad.

13764
08:42:46,990 --> 08:42:48,930
I just realized I did back-to-back long streams.

13765
08:42:50,050 --> 08:42:51,630
I had to read right after.

13766
08:42:51,790 --> 08:42:52,390
But, I don't...

13767
08:42:52,390 --> 08:42:53,290
This is the map.

13768
08:42:53,450 --> 08:42:54,390
This is trauma map.

13769
08:42:54,710 --> 08:42:55,550
PTSD map.

13770
08:42:57,230 --> 08:42:58,590
Oh, that is awkward.

13771
08:42:59,330 --> 08:42:59,850
Like...

13772
08:42:59,850 --> 08:43:00,790
I...

13773
08:43:00,790 --> 08:43:02,310
Did not expect that.

13774
08:43:02,850 --> 08:43:03,730
That's awkward.

13775
08:43:03,890 --> 08:43:04,750
I'm sorry, Loki.

13776
08:43:05,510 --> 08:43:08,430
If I knew that was gonna happen, I...

13777
08:43:08,970 --> 08:43:11,350
Would have, like, played right next to you.

13778
08:43:12,850 --> 08:43:13,550
Whoopsie.

13779
08:43:17,590 --> 08:43:18,290
Uh...

13780
08:43:18,290 --> 08:43:18,990
That's unlucky.

13781
08:43:26,480 --> 08:43:27,180
Okay.

13782
08:43:28,710 --> 08:43:29,640
Where's our...

13783
08:43:29,640 --> 08:43:31,180
Oh, my gosh.

13784
08:43:33,020 --> 08:43:34,100
I was gonna say, where's our Hela?

13785
08:43:43,240 --> 08:43:45,820
I was gonna say, that better fucking kill him.

13786
08:43:46,540 --> 08:43:47,020
After...

13787
08:43:47,020 --> 08:43:47,960
What I just did.

13788
08:43:53,260 --> 08:43:53,740
I...

13789
08:43:53,740 --> 08:43:54,300
I healed you!

13790
08:43:54,440 --> 08:43:55,000
I healed you!

13791
08:43:55,260 --> 08:43:56,320
I healed you!

13792
08:43:57,100 --> 08:43:57,580
I healed you!

13793
08:43:57,580 --> 08:43:58,240
That was low, unnecessary.

13794
08:43:59,380 --> 08:44:00,420
I healed him.

13795
08:44:01,140 --> 08:44:02,080
I healed him.

13796
08:44:02,200 --> 08:44:02,720
I healed him.

13797
08:44:02,720 --> 08:44:03,380
I hit him.

13798
08:44:07,130 --> 08:44:07,530
I hit him.

13799
08:44:11,070 --> 08:44:11,470
Oh...

13800
08:44:11,470 --> 08:44:13,070
He's getting a spawn camp, but it's okay.

13801
08:44:15,350 --> 08:44:16,130
Whatever, bruh.

13802
08:44:16,530 --> 08:44:16,970
Faded it.

13803
08:44:17,090 --> 08:44:17,790
You didn't get the touch.

13804
08:44:19,110 --> 08:44:20,110
I did the heals.

13805
08:44:20,290 --> 08:44:20,410
I...

13806
08:44:20,410 --> 08:44:21,750
I swear to God, I healed him.

13807
08:44:24,310 --> 08:44:25,410
I swear to God.

13808
08:44:26,290 --> 08:44:27,090
I healed him.

13809
08:44:27,190 --> 08:44:27,590
I swear.

13810
08:44:27,590 --> 08:44:27,990
Whoa!

13811
08:44:32,160 --> 08:44:33,400
I'm getting spawn camps.

13812
08:44:35,320 --> 08:44:36,080
Oh, no.

13813
08:44:36,900 --> 08:44:37,720
It's my turn.

13814
08:44:43,120 --> 08:44:44,340
Who is the Spider-Man?

13815
08:44:44,420 --> 08:44:46,540
That's the Spider-Man that, like, complained...

13816
08:44:47,540 --> 08:44:48,080
...before.

13817
08:45:00,780 --> 08:45:01,780
Oh, my God.

13818
08:45:03,760 --> 08:45:06,380
I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

13819
08:45:11,850 --> 08:45:12,210
Oh!

13820
08:45:14,090 --> 08:45:14,630
There we go.

13821
08:45:15,750 --> 08:45:16,070
Yay!

13822
08:45:18,890 --> 08:45:19,610
Dance.

13823
08:45:19,850 --> 08:45:20,210
Dance.

13824
08:45:20,650 --> 08:45:20,950
Dance.

13825
08:45:21,370 --> 08:45:21,910
Dance.

13826
08:45:22,510 --> 08:45:23,230
Dance.

13827
08:45:24,310 --> 08:45:25,870
Your powers are mine!

13828
08:45:27,790 --> 08:45:29,250
I'm a little worried.

13829
08:45:33,410 --> 08:45:34,330
I'm a little worried.

13830
08:45:34,570 --> 08:45:35,490
I'm in danger.

13831
08:45:35,890 --> 08:45:36,550
Haha!

13832
08:45:36,830 --> 08:45:37,830
I'm in a lot of danger.

13833
08:45:38,130 --> 08:45:38,130
Okay.

13834
08:45:43,210 --> 08:45:43,970
Ummmmmmmm...

13835
08:45:43,970 --> 08:45:43,970
Maybe.

13836
08:45:53,680 --> 08:45:56,080
That was a lot of danger.

13837
08:46:06,720 --> 08:46:07,860
We're okay.

13838
08:46:08,620 --> 08:46:09,360
Right now.

13839
08:46:10,120 --> 08:46:11,140
Until we're not.

13840
08:46:14,950 --> 08:46:16,010
I'm okay.

13841
08:46:16,290 --> 08:46:17,010
Until we're not.

13842
08:46:26,510 --> 08:46:27,410
Alright, nice.

13843
08:46:29,450 --> 08:46:31,890
Oh, that's unlucky.

13844
08:46:38,250 --> 08:46:40,110
Don't worry, I'm okay until we're not.

13845
08:46:40,290 --> 08:46:41,450
I am okay until we're not.

13846
08:46:43,530 --> 08:46:44,350
Wait, what?

13847
08:46:44,490 --> 08:46:45,210
Oh, it's a car!

13848
08:46:47,970 --> 08:46:48,490
Nice.

13849
08:46:48,930 --> 08:46:49,650
Thank God.

13850
08:46:50,290 --> 08:46:50,890
Not nice.

13851
08:46:57,240 --> 08:46:58,080
Wait, what?

13852
08:46:59,780 --> 08:47:00,300
Oh.

13853
08:47:00,300 --> 08:47:00,420
Oh.

13854
08:47:01,140 --> 08:47:02,440
He probably got back by now.

13855
08:47:05,700 --> 08:47:07,940
Oh my God, he's so low.

13856
08:47:11,580 --> 08:47:12,660
Oh my God.

13857
08:47:13,340 --> 08:47:14,720
I have to use that because we're low.

13858
08:47:16,460 --> 08:47:16,980
What?

13859
08:47:21,860 --> 08:47:22,380
Okay.

13860
08:47:23,640 --> 08:47:24,460
That's fine.

13861
08:47:28,430 --> 08:47:28,950
Peace.

13862
08:47:28,950 --> 08:47:30,950
Hulk's team is behind us.

13863
08:47:32,810 --> 08:47:35,150
There's so many people behind us!

13864
08:47:37,630 --> 08:47:38,390
Okay.

13865
08:47:41,190 --> 08:47:41,950
Nice.

13866
08:47:42,210 --> 08:47:42,410
Okay.

13867
08:47:44,630 --> 08:47:47,250
When is anybody not behind us?

13868
08:47:49,910 --> 08:47:51,090
Jesus Christ.

13869
08:47:55,130 --> 08:47:57,250
Just everybody is behind us!

13870
08:47:57,330 --> 08:47:58,270
They're all behind us!

13871
08:47:58,390 --> 08:47:58,550
No!

13872
08:47:59,070 --> 08:48:00,770
Oh my God, my fucking shield saved us!

13873
08:48:01,290 --> 08:48:02,230
That's actually crazy.

13874
08:48:11,330 --> 08:48:13,250
Oh my God, I'm gaming right now.

13875
08:48:13,350 --> 08:48:14,250
I'm actually gaming.

13876
08:48:14,490 --> 08:48:15,630
I'm actually gaming.

13877
08:48:17,210 --> 08:48:18,770
I'm actually doing so well.

13878
08:48:18,770 --> 08:48:21,690
I'm... I'm...

13879
08:48:21,690 --> 08:48:22,890
Oh my God.

13880
08:48:23,330 --> 08:48:24,510
That was...

13881
08:48:24,510 --> 08:48:27,050
That was actual gaming right there.

13882
08:48:27,510 --> 08:48:28,190
That...

13883
08:48:29,630 --> 08:48:30,750
Guys, like...

13884
08:48:30,750 --> 08:48:31,590
This is why...

13885
08:48:31,590 --> 08:48:32,850
There's no support strike.

13886
08:48:33,270 --> 08:48:36,570
People just don't want to play support right now.

13887
08:48:36,930 --> 08:48:38,930
You see what I just went through?

13888
08:48:39,310 --> 08:48:43,910
Did you all see the fucking gameplay I was going through just now?

13889
08:48:48,850 --> 08:48:49,270
No!

13890
08:48:56,280 --> 08:48:56,880
Oh no.

13891
08:48:57,120 --> 08:48:57,420
Oh no.

13892
08:48:57,540 --> 08:48:57,880
Don't worry.

13893
08:48:57,980 --> 08:48:58,980
My shield is still there.

13894
08:49:05,370 --> 08:49:05,790
Okay.

13895
08:49:10,940 --> 08:49:12,600
Okay, he's stalling it.

13896
08:49:13,400 --> 08:49:14,760
Oh my God, my frames...

13897
08:49:14,760 --> 08:49:15,600
I don't like this area.

13898
08:49:15,840 --> 08:49:17,680
My frames go to a hundred frames here.

13899
08:49:17,940 --> 08:49:19,420
This is actually so bad.

13900
08:49:39,200 --> 08:49:43,680
Oh my God, I need to concentrate so much because everybody is going through so much pain right now.

13901
08:49:43,860 --> 08:49:44,340
I...

13902
08:49:44,340 --> 08:49:46,000
I just finished...

13903
08:49:47,920 --> 08:49:48,720
Jesus Christ.

13904
08:49:50,640 --> 08:49:51,240
Please.

13905
08:49:51,680 --> 08:49:51,800
Please.

13906
08:49:54,760 --> 08:49:55,360
Okay.

13907
08:49:56,060 --> 08:49:57,060
Everything is fine.

13908
08:49:58,520 --> 08:49:59,780
Everything is fine.

13909
08:49:59,920 --> 08:50:00,680
Me and my team.

13910
08:50:06,490 --> 08:50:07,210
Okay.

13911
08:50:07,430 --> 08:50:08,310
That's okay.

13912
08:50:08,750 --> 08:50:10,370
I walk forward.

13913
08:50:11,170 --> 08:50:11,890
Jesus.

13914
08:50:12,210 --> 08:50:13,630
I am...

13915
08:50:18,010 --> 08:50:20,070
All I'm saying is that I'm gaming.

13916
08:50:20,350 --> 08:50:21,010
I'm gaming.

13917
08:50:21,470 --> 08:50:22,190
I'm...

13918
08:50:24,910 --> 08:50:25,890
I'm actually gaming.

13919
08:50:26,990 --> 08:50:27,910
That's all I'll say.

13920
08:50:27,910 --> 08:50:28,910
"...Okay."

13921
08:50:32,330 --> 08:50:33,210
Pizza.

13922
08:50:33,350 --> 08:50:36,590
"...TEARLAT NITO." I am juicy.

13923
08:50:41,610 --> 08:50:43,310
I'm safe.

13924
08:50:44,690 --> 08:50:46,190
I'm safe.

13925
08:50:48,690 --> 08:50:50,730
I am to say.

13926
08:50:52,950 --> 08:50:54,190
Jesus Christ.

13927
08:50:54,190 --> 08:50:54,270
Nice.

13928
08:50:56,310 --> 08:50:59,090
I'm actually playing out of my mind right now.

13929
08:51:00,470 --> 08:51:03,990
I'm... I'm playing out of my mind.

13930
08:51:04,230 --> 08:51:12,590
Oh my god, I was playing... I was like... My suit there was actually so fucking good.

13931
08:51:12,870 --> 08:51:15,410
I was playing out of my fucking mind there.

13932
08:51:15,410 --> 08:51:16,370
I...

13933
08:51:35,250 --> 08:51:38,530
Turny was... yeah, the turny was so warm-up.

13934
08:51:43,030 --> 08:51:44,150
Oh, you know what?

13935
08:51:44,330 --> 08:51:45,370
I fucked with that name.

13936
08:51:45,610 --> 08:51:45,790
You know what?

13937
08:51:45,790 --> 08:51:46,330
I fucked with it.

13938
08:51:50,110 --> 08:51:53,230
Yeah, the invisible woman... Invis-woman...

13939
08:51:55,770 --> 08:51:57,230
Actually was such a clutch pick.

13940
08:52:00,310 --> 08:52:01,870
It was such a clutch pick.

13941
08:52:02,050 --> 08:52:03,670
They can't literally do anything.

13942
08:52:07,960 --> 08:52:11,160
I love my team compared to yours.

13943
08:52:20,900 --> 08:52:22,080
I'm having fun.

13944
08:52:22,620 --> 08:52:23,220
I'm having fun.

13945
08:52:25,900 --> 08:52:29,580
Oh my god, do you see her when she jumps?

13946
08:52:30,040 --> 08:52:32,380
She archers her back a little bit.

13947
08:52:33,060 --> 08:52:33,780
Yeah.

13948
08:52:37,300 --> 08:52:39,240
All I'm saying is that's important.

13949
08:52:39,480 --> 08:52:40,940
Very important information.

13950
08:52:55,980 --> 08:52:57,660
I don't even want to go up.

13951
08:52:57,680 --> 08:52:58,680
It's just scary, bro.

13952
08:53:03,780 --> 08:53:08,580
Oh my god, I'm trying my best to do my tanks a lot.

13953
08:53:19,540 --> 08:53:20,420
Oh no.

13954
08:53:24,810 --> 08:53:26,150
Okay, that's fine.

13955
08:53:26,250 --> 08:53:26,490
We're fine.

13956
08:53:26,570 --> 08:53:26,810
We're fine.

13957
08:53:26,930 --> 08:53:27,130
We're fine.

13958
08:53:27,190 --> 08:53:27,890
There's no... Oh no.

13959
08:53:28,770 --> 08:53:29,910
It's just gaming.

13960
08:53:30,550 --> 08:53:31,410
There's never... Oh no.

13961
08:53:31,570 --> 08:53:32,690
It's just... It's just gaming.

13962
08:53:34,830 --> 08:53:35,890
Oh my god.

13963
08:53:36,110 --> 08:53:37,230
No, that is not better.

13964
08:53:37,570 --> 08:53:41,690
That is absolutely...

13965
08:53:41,690 --> 08:53:43,430
That was definitely not better.

13966
08:53:47,250 --> 08:53:47,970
Jesus Christ.

13967
08:53:51,710 --> 08:53:52,370
Oh my god.

13968
08:53:52,430 --> 08:53:52,770
Oh my god.

13969
08:53:52,870 --> 08:53:53,090
Oh my god.

13970
08:53:53,130 --> 08:53:54,150
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

13971
08:53:55,110 --> 08:53:56,330
I don't have bubble issues.

13972
08:53:56,490 --> 08:53:56,850
I'm sorry.

13973
08:53:57,270 --> 08:54:02,390
I got the full pushed up.

13974
08:54:30,070 --> 08:54:33,550
that's not fair.

13975
08:54:33,550 --> 08:54:35,110
I got stuck!

13976
08:54:37,490 --> 08:54:39,610
I got stuck!

13977
08:54:40,190 --> 08:54:41,430
Oh my god, she's winning!

13978
08:54:42,430 --> 08:54:43,890
She's fucking one-shot.

13979
08:54:48,290 --> 08:54:49,430
That's crazy.

13980
08:54:57,170 --> 08:54:58,990
Get me out of here.

13981
08:55:05,140 --> 08:55:05,900
Oh!

13982
08:55:05,900 --> 08:55:07,000
Oh my god!

13983
08:55:09,360 --> 08:55:09,900
Oh, please!

13984
08:55:11,560 --> 08:55:13,160
Oh my god, thank you!

13985
08:55:15,100 --> 08:55:16,940
Oh my god, please!

13986
08:55:24,860 --> 08:55:26,120
What was that?

13987
08:55:29,000 --> 08:55:30,520
Holy shit!

13988
08:55:31,460 --> 08:55:35,020
I won't say it was targeted, but...

13989
08:55:36,060 --> 08:55:38,200
This felt like a hate crime.

13990
08:55:39,720 --> 08:55:40,960
How is that?

13991
08:55:41,880 --> 08:55:42,320
What?

13992
08:55:43,580 --> 08:55:44,660
They actually don't know I'm here.

13993
08:55:44,820 --> 08:55:45,400
They don't know I'm here.

13994
08:55:45,420 --> 08:55:46,740
It felt...

13995
08:55:50,840 --> 08:55:51,720
It really...

13996
08:55:52,360 --> 08:55:55,300
It really felt like a hate crime, not gonna lie.

13997
08:55:55,400 --> 08:55:56,120
Someone give that man care.

13998
08:55:57,060 --> 08:55:58,340
I fucking hate this game.

13999
08:55:59,020 --> 08:55:59,460
Tragic.

14000
08:56:02,960 --> 08:56:04,760
Okay, I don't have my thing anymore.

14001
08:56:04,840 --> 08:56:06,500
One clapping and then he live.

14002
08:56:06,760 --> 08:56:07,200
Great.

14003
08:56:09,000 --> 08:56:09,640
Yo, Emma?

14004
08:56:10,340 --> 08:56:10,740
Emma!

14005
08:56:13,880 --> 08:56:14,320
NOOOOO!

14006
08:56:18,000 --> 08:56:19,840
Back up, back up, back up, back up.

14007
08:56:20,340 --> 08:56:20,780
Goodbye.

14008
08:56:20,780 --> 08:56:21,800
Judge!

14009
08:56:21,900 --> 08:56:22,700
Judge!

14010
08:56:22,700 --> 08:56:23,040
Jury!

14011
08:56:24,180 --> 08:56:24,980
Executioner!

14012
08:56:25,380 --> 08:56:26,160
Will we live?

14013
08:56:29,880 --> 08:56:31,080
We will.

14014
08:56:31,880 --> 08:56:32,980
We live.

14015
08:56:38,040 --> 08:56:38,440
Damn!

14016
08:56:39,340 --> 08:56:40,360
What the fuck?

14017
08:56:44,560 --> 08:56:45,820
Jesus Christ.

14018
08:56:46,520 --> 08:56:47,240
Get the door, get the door.

14019
08:56:47,240 --> 08:56:47,420
Please.

14020
08:56:48,280 --> 08:56:49,520
I swear to God.

14021
08:56:50,100 --> 08:56:50,780
Where am I?

14022
08:56:50,860 --> 08:56:51,580
What's going on?

14023
08:56:54,220 --> 08:56:54,860
Ew.

14024
08:56:59,880 --> 08:57:01,280
That was a...

14025
08:57:01,280 --> 08:57:03,320
That game was...

14026
08:57:03,320 --> 08:57:04,360
20 death room.

14027
08:57:04,700 --> 08:57:05,240
Three.

14028
08:57:06,040 --> 08:57:09,720
I now place a North American curse upon you.

14029
08:57:10,180 --> 08:57:13,340
For this almost 8 hour Marvel rivalry.

14030
08:57:14,040 --> 08:57:16,320
All your teams shall...

14031
08:57:18,920 --> 08:57:23,440
Shall have misfortune till the ancestors are appeased.

14032
08:57:23,840 --> 08:57:26,080
Thank you for the super chat, Mr. Broken Bond.

14033
08:57:26,280 --> 08:57:27,220
Thank you, thank you.

14034
08:57:27,740 --> 08:57:29,160
Okay, but like...

14035
08:57:29,160 --> 08:57:30,280
Wait, let me double check.

14036
08:57:30,480 --> 08:57:31,620
Wait, it's my food.

14037
08:57:36,990 --> 08:57:38,450
My food's here.

14038
08:57:39,860 --> 08:57:40,950
Oh my god.

14039
08:57:42,530 --> 08:57:44,010
Wait, it's here?

14040
08:57:46,660 --> 08:57:47,750
My food's here.

14041
08:57:53,660 --> 08:57:54,110
Yay!

14042
08:57:55,330 --> 08:57:55,550
Wait.

14043
08:57:57,850 --> 08:57:58,750
Food.

14044
08:57:59,750 --> 08:58:00,650
Yeah.

14045
08:58:01,750 --> 08:58:03,440
I eat, but...

14046
08:58:03,910 --> 08:58:05,250
Will you keep playing?

14047
08:58:06,470 --> 08:58:08,070
After food...

14048
08:58:09,850 --> 08:58:11,510
I'm still dooming.

14049
08:58:20,840 --> 08:58:23,380
After I'm done eating.

14050
08:58:24,720 --> 08:58:24,980
Okay.

14051
08:58:26,300 --> 08:58:27,700
Curse of Rob.

14052
08:58:27,900 --> 08:58:30,440
Kazuma, thank you for the super chat.

14053
08:58:30,660 --> 08:58:31,920
Thank you, thank you.

14054
08:58:32,800 --> 08:58:33,220
Alright.

14055
08:58:34,060 --> 08:58:34,500
We'll break.

14056
08:58:38,340 --> 08:58:38,940
Food break.

14057
08:58:38,940 --> 08:58:39,480
Give me a sec.

14058
08:58:39,660 --> 08:58:40,700
Let me...

14059
08:58:42,140 --> 08:58:42,740
Alright.

14060
08:58:43,300 --> 08:58:44,140
It's food break.

14061
08:58:44,360 --> 08:58:45,880
But since it's food break...

14062
08:58:46,500 --> 08:58:48,160
Let me be here right now.

14063
08:58:48,860 --> 08:58:49,740
Let's chill.

14064
08:58:51,020 --> 08:58:51,620
Okay.

14065
08:58:53,680 --> 08:58:54,280
Alright.

14066
08:58:55,460 --> 08:58:56,320
Let's see.

14067
08:58:56,600 --> 08:58:57,860
Let me...

14068
08:58:58,980 --> 08:59:00,680
Turn this on.

14069
08:59:01,660 --> 08:59:03,120
Be right back.

14070
08:59:03,440 --> 08:59:05,000
This will appease you.

14071
08:59:05,560 --> 08:59:06,880
I know one...

14072
08:59:06,880 --> 08:59:08,540
I know one thing.

14073
08:59:08,980 --> 08:59:13,080
I know what I can do to make you guys less mad.

14074
08:59:19,980 --> 08:59:23,040
Can you really be mad now?

14075
08:59:23,600 --> 08:59:23,860
Nah.

14076
08:59:25,980 --> 08:59:28,200
You can't be mad...

14077
08:59:28,720 --> 08:59:30,160
After you...

14078
08:59:30,160 --> 08:59:34,540
How can you be mad when I'm too giddy?

14079
08:59:34,540 --> 08:59:34,900
I'm too giddy.

14080
08:59:40,520 --> 08:59:43,520
Now I'm even more mad.

14081
08:59:44,780 --> 08:59:45,660
Let me...

14082
08:59:45,660 --> 08:59:46,380
Let me...

14083
08:59:46,380 --> 08:59:47,440
Oh wait.

14084
08:59:47,640 --> 08:59:48,080
Give me a sec.

14085
08:59:48,180 --> 08:59:48,540
Food's here.

14086
08:59:48,720 --> 08:59:49,000
Food.

14087
09:00:01,360 --> 09:00:03,210
Can you really be mad...

14088
09:00:03,760 --> 09:00:05,360
When your kitty is here?

14089
09:00:05,360 --> 09:00:05,860
Well...

14090
09:00:11,300 --> 09:00:13,700
If you continue to curse me...

14091
09:00:13,700 --> 09:00:15,020
Go kitty is gone.

14092
09:00:15,780 --> 09:00:17,140
Go kitty will leave.

14093
09:00:17,520 --> 09:00:19,020
You are forgiven.

14094
09:00:20,000 --> 09:00:21,520
See guys...

14095
09:00:22,360 --> 09:00:24,380
I know how to play the game.

14096
09:00:24,840 --> 09:00:26,660
I know...

14097
09:00:28,200 --> 09:00:30,000
I know how the game works.

14098
09:00:30,000 --> 09:00:30,600
Yeah.

14099
09:00:33,100 --> 09:00:33,540
Wait.

14100
09:00:33,540 --> 09:00:34,300
Let me get my fork.

14101
09:00:34,420 --> 09:00:34,860
I'll be right back.

14102
09:00:34,960 --> 09:00:35,680
You didn't give me a fork.

14103
09:00:35,680 --> 09:00:36,200
I'm sad.

14104
09:00:53,750 --> 09:00:54,190
Alright.

14105
09:00:54,890 --> 09:00:56,210
I got my fork.

14106
09:01:00,170 --> 09:01:00,610
Alright.

14107
09:01:00,830 --> 09:01:01,410
Let me...

14108
09:01:02,590 --> 09:01:03,470
Double check...

14109
09:01:03,470 --> 09:01:04,050
Everything.

14110
09:01:04,850 --> 09:01:05,070
Alright.

14111
09:01:05,190 --> 09:01:05,610
Food break!

14112
09:01:06,130 --> 09:01:06,570
Yippee!

14113
09:01:07,670 --> 09:01:08,330
Let's see.

14114
09:01:08,530 --> 09:01:11,290
I know it's more smart to do this stream...

14115
09:01:13,130 --> 09:01:13,570
On...

14116
09:01:15,290 --> 09:01:17,550
I sure 1% did the stream on Twitch.

14117
09:01:17,770 --> 09:01:19,150
That's how long I've been playing.

14118
09:01:19,410 --> 09:01:20,310
But like...

14119
09:01:20,310 --> 09:01:20,930
I'm not that smart.

14120
09:01:24,590 --> 09:01:26,470
I'm not that smart though.

14121
09:01:26,750 --> 09:01:26,950
Okay.

14122
09:01:27,830 --> 09:01:28,810
Food break!

14123
09:01:30,610 --> 09:01:31,170
Mini...

14124
09:01:31,170 --> 09:01:32,290
Goodnight Dragoons.

14125
09:01:33,290 --> 09:01:35,150
It's our mini Goodnight Dragoons.

14126
09:01:35,390 --> 09:01:37,010
But we'll have the real one.

14127
09:01:37,150 --> 09:01:38,090
We'll have the real one.

14128
09:01:38,290 --> 09:01:38,670
Tomorrow.

14129
09:01:42,230 --> 09:01:42,790
Alright.

14130
09:01:42,890 --> 09:01:43,410
Food break!

14131
09:01:43,410 --> 09:01:45,310
Ha ha ha ha ha!

14132
09:01:47,850 --> 09:01:48,170
Okay.

14133
09:01:48,650 --> 09:01:49,270
Let's go.

14134
09:01:50,190 --> 09:01:50,610
Alright.

14135
09:01:51,350 --> 09:01:53,110
We'll have the real one tomorrow night.

14136
09:01:53,570 --> 09:01:53,810
Yeah!

14137
09:01:54,390 --> 09:01:55,290
And it'll be the weekend!

14138
09:01:56,270 --> 09:01:56,950
Yeah!

14139
09:01:57,250 --> 09:01:58,510
I got a...

14140
09:01:58,510 --> 09:02:00,650
I got the Japanese scourge.

14141
09:02:01,610 --> 09:02:02,410
And...

14142
09:02:03,950 --> 09:02:04,750
Mentaiko...

14143
09:02:05,410 --> 09:02:06,350
Udon.

14144
09:02:06,350 --> 09:02:08,390
I love Mentaiko Udon.

14145
09:02:08,750 --> 09:02:09,650
It's one of my...

14146
09:02:09,650 --> 09:02:09,730
Ooh!

14147
09:02:09,890 --> 09:02:10,350
And then...

14148
09:02:10,350 --> 09:02:11,970
They gave me like this like...

14149
09:02:11,970 --> 09:02:13,270
Half runny...

14150
09:02:13,270 --> 09:02:13,650
Yolks.

14151
09:02:13,770 --> 09:02:14,950
So it's even better.

14152
09:02:15,350 --> 09:02:15,750
Ooh!

14153
09:02:16,490 --> 09:02:17,150
Yummy!

14154
09:02:18,870 --> 09:02:19,590
Mmm.

14155
09:02:20,490 --> 09:02:21,230
I'm so weird.

14156
09:02:21,290 --> 09:02:22,610
This is actually my first meal today.

14157
09:02:23,710 --> 09:02:24,290
I'm gonna...

14158
09:02:24,290 --> 09:02:24,670
Make sure.

14159
09:02:25,130 --> 09:02:26,170
Why is he so far?

14160
09:02:27,770 --> 09:02:28,250
Okay.

14161
09:02:28,310 --> 09:02:29,590
My drink won't be here until...

14162
09:02:30,170 --> 09:02:30,230
Wait.

14163
09:02:30,290 --> 09:02:31,150
Arriving now.

14164
09:02:31,350 --> 09:02:32,130
But he's so far.

14165
09:02:32,910 --> 09:02:33,750
That's a lie.

14166
09:02:33,750 --> 09:02:34,970
I still see him.

14167
09:02:37,390 --> 09:02:38,390
Where is he?

14168
09:02:38,750 --> 09:02:39,030
Wait.

14169
09:02:39,050 --> 09:02:41,250
He's driving away from me.

14170
09:02:44,730 --> 09:02:45,290
I'm...

14171
09:02:45,290 --> 09:02:46,250
I'm...

14172
09:02:46,250 --> 09:02:46,930
I'm watching the...

14173
09:02:46,930 --> 09:02:48,090
The drink won?

14174
09:02:48,370 --> 09:02:50,090
And the guy is...

14175
09:02:50,090 --> 09:02:51,250
Driving away...

14176
09:02:51,930 --> 09:02:53,030
From me.

14177
09:02:57,400 --> 09:02:58,660
No, that's not good.

14178
09:02:59,300 --> 09:03:00,220
I want...

14179
09:03:00,220 --> 09:03:01,300
Don't get it.

14180
09:03:01,700 --> 09:03:02,600
I want...

14181
09:03:02,600 --> 09:03:03,160
Don't feel.

14182
09:03:03,440 --> 09:03:05,080
It's welcome to the tomato fire.

14183
09:03:05,340 --> 09:03:05,440
Welcome.

14184
09:03:05,560 --> 09:03:05,720
Welcome.

14185
09:03:05,860 --> 09:03:06,280
Dark place.

14186
09:03:06,480 --> 09:03:07,400
Thank you for the super chat.

14187
09:03:07,540 --> 09:03:07,780
Thank you.

14188
09:03:07,900 --> 09:03:08,380
Thank you.

14189
09:03:11,740 --> 09:03:13,400
There's no way...

14190
09:03:13,400 --> 09:03:16,320
My drink is gonna be stolen as well!

14191
09:03:17,120 --> 09:03:18,160
I def...

14192
09:03:18,160 --> 09:03:18,720
Oh my god.

14193
09:03:19,380 --> 09:03:20,720
There's no fucking way.

14194
09:03:20,940 --> 09:03:21,340
That's so...

14195
09:03:21,340 --> 09:03:22,460
How unlucky can I be?

14196
09:03:32,020 --> 09:03:34,140
How fucking unlucky can I be?

14197
09:03:34,380 --> 09:03:35,640
They steal my drink.

14198
09:03:35,760 --> 09:03:36,380
I'm so sad.

14199
09:03:41,790 --> 09:03:44,110
I hope I get invited to more of these tournaments.

14200
09:03:44,530 --> 09:03:45,730
It's been very fun.

14201
09:03:47,990 --> 09:03:48,630
I hope I...

14202
09:03:48,630 --> 09:03:49,550
I actually enjoy...

14203
09:03:49,550 --> 09:03:51,370
These types of kind of great tournaments is more fun.

14204
09:03:51,950 --> 09:03:53,450
It's definitely much more balanced.

14205
09:03:53,990 --> 09:03:55,370
I just wish I wasn't...

14206
09:03:55,370 --> 09:03:56,610
Put in the...

14207
09:03:56,610 --> 09:03:59,050
I wish I wasn't put in...

14208
09:04:00,090 --> 09:04:00,450
Um...

14209
09:04:00,450 --> 09:04:01,470
Second choice though.

14210
09:04:01,930 --> 09:04:02,330
So that's snake.

14211
09:04:02,410 --> 09:04:03,110
Thank you for the super chat.

14212
09:04:03,210 --> 09:04:03,410
Thank you.

14213
09:04:03,490 --> 09:04:03,910
Thank you.

14214
09:04:04,090 --> 09:04:04,470
Your honor.

14215
09:04:04,590 --> 09:04:05,570
Look at how cute she is.

14216
09:04:05,570 --> 09:04:05,870
She...

14217
09:04:05,870 --> 09:04:06,090
Yeah.

14218
09:04:06,230 --> 09:04:07,210
You can't be mad at me.

14219
09:04:07,350 --> 09:04:07,930
I'm Doe Kitty.

14220
09:04:15,640 --> 09:04:17,220
That's my trump card.

14221
09:04:18,680 --> 09:04:19,580
Every time.

14222
09:04:20,800 --> 09:04:23,220
As long as I bring out Doe Kitty...

14223
09:04:23,220 --> 09:04:24,400
All this forgiven.

14224
09:04:24,760 --> 09:04:25,620
What?

14225
09:04:28,080 --> 09:04:28,220
What?

14226
09:04:28,220 --> 09:04:28,640
Come...

14227
09:04:28,640 --> 09:04:30,020
Dude, he's driving away!

14228
09:04:32,020 --> 09:04:34,540
Why is he driving away?

14229
09:04:35,360 --> 09:04:36,160
Come back!

14230
09:04:37,480 --> 09:04:38,440
Come...

14231
09:04:38,440 --> 09:04:39,500
Come back!

14232
09:04:42,340 --> 09:04:43,760
I'm watching it!

14233
09:04:46,020 --> 09:04:46,400
Like...

14234
09:04:46,400 --> 09:04:47,520
It's two drinks!

14235
09:04:47,760 --> 09:04:48,840
I bought two, so like...

14236
09:04:48,840 --> 09:04:49,700
I can drink the...

14237
09:04:49,700 --> 09:04:50,620
The other one tomorrow.

14238
09:04:57,240 --> 09:04:57,580
Hi!

14239
09:04:57,640 --> 09:04:58,520
Thank you for the super chat.

14240
09:04:58,620 --> 09:04:58,840
Thank you.

14241
09:04:58,980 --> 09:04:59,400
Thank you.

14242
09:04:59,400 --> 09:05:00,660
Blessing a bass...

14243
09:05:00,660 --> 09:05:02,900
Basset upon this cute little kitty.

14244
09:05:03,500 --> 09:05:03,660
Haha!

14245
09:05:04,240 --> 09:05:05,280
Thank you for the super chat.

14246
09:05:05,380 --> 09:05:05,620
Thank you.

14247
09:05:13,880 --> 09:05:15,180
Hey, what's this they added?

14248
09:05:15,800 --> 09:05:16,140
Oh!

14249
09:05:18,540 --> 09:05:19,880
Oh, it's a chicken skewer.

14250
09:05:20,080 --> 09:05:21,720
It was wrapped in such a weird way.

14251
09:05:24,740 --> 09:05:25,180
Hmm.

14252
09:05:30,960 --> 09:05:32,100
I love Japanese skewers.

14253
09:05:32,180 --> 09:05:32,740
What are they called?

14254
09:05:33,140 --> 09:05:34,520
There's a special name for them.

14255
09:05:38,120 --> 09:05:39,120
What is it called?

14256
09:05:39,780 --> 09:05:40,320
The...

14257
09:05:41,620 --> 09:05:42,160
Um...

14258
09:05:42,160 --> 09:05:43,840
The Japanese skewers.

14259
09:05:47,330 --> 09:05:48,550
I don't know what they're called.

14260
09:05:49,950 --> 09:05:50,490
Also...

14261
09:05:50,490 --> 09:05:51,650
Okay, is this something...

14262
09:05:51,650 --> 09:05:52,290
Oh, Yakitori!

14263
09:05:52,370 --> 09:05:52,630
Yes!

14264
09:05:52,750 --> 09:05:52,930
Yes!

14265
09:05:53,190 --> 09:05:53,730
Yakitori!

14266
09:05:53,770 --> 09:05:54,770
I love Yakitori.

14267
09:06:01,440 --> 09:06:02,580
Yakitori is so good.

14268
09:06:05,600 --> 09:06:07,880
I haven't had Yakitori in a long time.

14269
09:06:10,860 --> 09:06:12,200
So I'm treating myself.

14270
09:06:15,780 --> 09:06:20,180
I'm rewarding myself because I think personally, I did a really good job.

14271
09:06:21,040 --> 09:06:21,440
Personally.

14272
09:06:23,840 --> 09:06:25,620
I think I did really well.

14273
09:06:26,000 --> 09:06:27,340
I met new people.

14274
09:06:28,660 --> 09:06:29,180
I...

14275
09:06:32,390 --> 09:06:36,170
I think performance-wise, I was doing really well.

14276
09:06:38,110 --> 09:06:39,310
My own performance.

14277
09:06:45,100 --> 09:06:46,140
And like...

14278
09:06:46,700 --> 09:06:48,480
And people said I was a good support.

14279
09:06:49,160 --> 09:06:50,220
So I'm happy.

14280
09:06:51,320 --> 09:06:56,460
And I was like the only VTuber invited, so I was like trying my best to be like a normal person.

14281
09:07:03,040 --> 09:07:06,420
I was trying my best to not freak anyone out.

14282
09:07:15,980 --> 09:07:16,820
And...

14283
09:07:17,760 --> 09:07:18,180
And...

14284
09:07:19,840 --> 09:07:21,100
And I thought...

14285
09:07:21,920 --> 09:07:23,520
And also...

14286
09:07:23,520 --> 09:07:24,620
I think...

14287
09:07:25,600 --> 09:07:27,400
And I wasn't last pick.

14288
09:07:27,640 --> 09:07:28,200
You're right!

14289
09:07:28,820 --> 09:07:30,640
I wasn't last pick!

14290
09:07:31,220 --> 09:07:31,640
Guys!

14291
09:07:32,120 --> 09:07:33,640
That's the best part!

14292
09:07:33,960 --> 09:07:35,500
I wasn't picked last!

14293
09:07:37,290 --> 09:07:38,860
People actually wanted me!

14294
09:07:41,920 --> 09:07:45,380
If only Super didn't snag me from Nekros, I could've been first pick.

14295
09:07:47,940 --> 09:07:48,930
I don't know!

14296
09:07:53,460 --> 09:07:54,900
I don't know!

14297
09:07:55,420 --> 09:07:57,220
Because I had a Nekros one in me too!

14298
09:07:58,060 --> 09:07:58,600
I don't know!

14299
09:07:59,100 --> 09:08:00,420
I couldn't...

14300
09:08:00,420 --> 09:08:01,320
I couldn't...

14301
09:08:04,300 --> 09:08:05,700
I'm saying...

14302
09:08:05,700 --> 09:08:07,380
All I'm saying...

14303
09:08:07,380 --> 09:08:07,640
All I'm saying...

14304
09:08:07,640 --> 09:08:08,640
Is that...

14305
09:08:08,640 --> 09:08:10,100
If Super didn't pick me...

14306
09:08:10,100 --> 09:08:11,700
Nekros was gonna pick me...

14307
09:08:11,700 --> 09:08:14,740
And then I could've been first place, guys!

14308
09:08:15,060 --> 09:08:15,780
I don't know!

14309
09:08:20,360 --> 09:08:21,880
I traded...

14310
09:08:21,880 --> 09:08:23,460
I traded first place...

14311
09:08:23,980 --> 09:08:25,660
All I'm saying...

14312
09:08:26,540 --> 09:08:27,560
You're right!

14313
09:08:29,540 --> 09:08:31,680
I can always get 20k...

14314
09:08:32,800 --> 09:08:34,560
I could always get 20k...

14315
09:08:36,440 --> 09:08:36,920
Somehow...

14316
09:08:37,540 --> 09:08:38,760
Maybe it'll take me a bit...

14317
09:08:39,860 --> 09:08:40,200
There...

14318
09:08:40,200 --> 09:08:40,600
I could...

14319
09:08:40,600 --> 09:08:42,600
There was always a way to get 20k...

14320
09:08:42,600 --> 09:08:43,720
But there's never...

14321
09:08:43,720 --> 09:08:44,060
There's...

14322
09:08:44,060 --> 09:08:45,940
There's very rarely a way...

14323
09:08:45,940 --> 09:08:47,240
To play with Tyler one!

14324
09:08:47,500 --> 09:08:48,520
You're so right, guys!

14325
09:08:50,600 --> 09:08:51,640
You're so right!

14326
09:08:51,900 --> 09:08:53,040
No, apparently...

14327
09:08:53,040 --> 09:08:55,560
Chat was telling me that Nekros was gonna choose me...

14328
09:08:55,560 --> 09:08:57,020
After...

14329
09:08:59,040 --> 09:08:59,560
Apparently...

14330
09:09:00,080 --> 09:09:01,620
Apparently he's gonna pick me...

14331
09:09:08,450 --> 09:09:09,570
But like...

14332
09:09:10,950 --> 09:09:11,990
Um...

14333
09:09:11,990 --> 09:09:12,470
Yeah...

14334
09:09:12,470 --> 09:09:12,870
Tyler...

14335
09:09:12,870 --> 09:09:14,790
The experience playing with Tyler one...

14336
09:09:15,130 --> 09:09:16,190
That's priceless!

14337
09:09:16,190 --> 09:09:16,490
This...

14338
09:09:25,790 --> 09:09:28,750
That's a priceless opportunity...

14339
09:09:31,730 --> 09:09:35,170
I'm gonna check the drinks...

14340
09:09:40,380 --> 09:09:42,320
Is that delivery?!

14341
09:09:43,680 --> 09:09:44,440
How?!

14342
09:09:48,430 --> 09:09:49,890
I'm gonna check a...

14343
09:09:49,890 --> 09:09:51,310
What?!

14344
09:09:57,570 --> 09:09:59,330
Oh, the alcohol-y...

14345
09:09:59,330 --> 09:10:02,450
No way!

14346
09:10:03,530 --> 09:10:04,990
I'm calling!

14347
09:10:05,150 --> 09:10:07,390
Give me a sec...

14348
09:14:19,990 --> 09:14:21,570
I'm so...

14349
09:14:21,570 --> 09:14:23,510
I'm so sad!

14350
09:14:24,270 --> 09:14:26,470
I can't believe it!

14351
09:14:26,830 --> 09:14:29,330
This man drove away!

14352
09:14:29,670 --> 09:14:32,210
I was watching him drive away!

14353
09:14:32,950 --> 09:14:35,330
What is today?!

14354
09:14:35,330 --> 09:14:36,890
Is today like...

14355
09:14:36,890 --> 09:14:38,330
Fuck Doki Day!

14356
09:14:39,850 --> 09:14:40,730
Like...

14357
09:14:40,730 --> 09:14:41,230
Like...

14358
09:14:41,230 --> 09:14:42,710
Everything that can...

14359
09:14:42,710 --> 09:14:43,450
Oh my god!

14360
09:14:43,790 --> 09:14:44,390
I was...

14361
09:14:44,390 --> 09:14:47,250
I was so looking forward to my drink...

14362
09:14:47,470 --> 09:14:48,190
I'm...

14363
09:14:48,190 --> 09:14:50,170
I'm so sad...

14364
09:14:50,170 --> 09:14:51,890
I'm so sad...

14365
09:14:52,910 --> 09:14:53,590
Like...

14366
09:14:53,590 --> 09:14:56,370
I could check downstairs...

14367
09:14:56,370 --> 09:14:58,230
To like...

14368
09:14:58,890 --> 09:14:59,270
Um...

14369
09:14:59,270 --> 09:15:00,350
They're not refunding it!

14370
09:15:00,490 --> 09:15:01,630
They just said like...

14371
09:15:01,630 --> 09:15:03,310
They didn't even contact me!

14372
09:15:04,090 --> 09:15:04,770
Like...

14373
09:15:04,770 --> 09:15:07,650
They didn't even contact me!

14374
09:15:07,830 --> 09:15:10,950
I could check downstairs to see if they left it down...

14375
09:15:11,810 --> 09:15:13,850
Should I check downstairs just to be sure?

14376
09:15:14,910 --> 09:15:18,330
They said they delivered it 10 minutes ago...

14377
09:15:18,330 --> 09:15:19,230
But like...

14378
09:15:19,230 --> 09:15:20,390
I looked at it...

14379
09:15:21,320 --> 09:15:22,530
Should I check downstairs?

14380
09:15:23,030 --> 09:15:23,730
Just to make sure?

14381
09:15:24,290 --> 09:15:24,410
Okay!

14382
09:15:24,550 --> 09:15:25,290
I'll check downstairs!

14383
09:15:25,730 --> 09:15:26,510
I'll be right back guys!

14384
09:15:26,730 --> 09:15:27,590
I'll check downstairs!

14385
09:15:29,090 --> 09:15:30,750
Be right back everybody!

14386
09:15:31,230 --> 09:15:32,010
This is important!

14387
09:15:33,690 --> 09:15:35,310
I'll be right back!

14388
09:15:36,070 --> 09:15:36,730
I...

14389
09:15:38,170 --> 09:15:38,870
Okay!

14390
09:15:39,590 --> 09:15:41,070
Be right back!

14391
09:15:41,370 --> 09:15:42,070
Checking...

14392
09:15:42,070 --> 09:15:43,050
Downstairs!

14393
09:15:44,330 --> 09:15:45,030
Down...

14394
09:15:45,030 --> 09:15:45,850
Stairs!

14395
09:15:46,610 --> 09:15:47,310
If...

14396
09:15:47,310 --> 09:15:48,410
Food...

14397
09:15:48,410 --> 09:15:49,730
Drink is down there!

14398
09:15:49,730 --> 09:15:51,730
I'm not gonna reorder it!

14399
09:15:51,990 --> 09:15:52,070
I'm not gonna reorder it!

14400
09:15:52,070 --> 09:15:52,390
Because like...

14401
09:15:52,390 --> 09:15:54,230
By the time it gets here...

14402
09:15:54,830 --> 09:15:55,310
Um...

14403
09:15:55,970 --> 09:15:56,450
Um...

14404
09:15:56,450 --> 09:15:58,330
I'm already gonna finish my food!

14405
09:15:58,690 --> 09:15:59,090
Ugh...

14406
09:15:59,090 --> 09:16:00,010
I'm so sad!

14407
09:16:00,630 --> 09:16:02,190
I had to drink...

14408
09:16:02,190 --> 09:16:02,710
Like...

14409
09:16:02,710 --> 09:16:03,590
I really wanted...

14410
09:16:03,590 --> 09:16:04,690
I wanted a nice drink!

14411
09:16:04,810 --> 09:16:05,570
But I've been drinking...

14412
09:16:05,570 --> 09:16:07,250
I was drinking water with my food!

14413
09:16:07,330 --> 09:16:08,790
I wanted something nice to drink!

14414
09:16:09,130 --> 09:16:10,190
I'll be right back guys!

14415
09:20:37,700 --> 09:20:38,780
This...

14416
09:20:38,780 --> 09:20:40,500
There was no...

14417
09:20:40,500 --> 09:20:42,380
There was no...

14418
09:20:42,380 --> 09:20:42,980
There was no drink!

14419
09:20:43,360 --> 09:20:44,340
Toki sad!

14420
09:20:44,800 --> 09:20:45,740
Toki sad!

14421
09:20:46,980 --> 09:20:47,960
Toki sad!

14422
09:20:47,960 --> 09:20:50,340
Toki has to drink stupid water!

14423
09:20:52,200 --> 09:20:53,540
Sad kitty!

14424
09:20:54,660 --> 09:20:56,000
I'm so sad!

14425
09:20:57,040 --> 09:20:59,260
That happened twice in a row!

14426
09:21:00,240 --> 09:21:01,040
I had never had...

14427
09:21:01,040 --> 09:21:02,320
I only had that happen...

14428
09:21:02,320 --> 09:21:04,110
The last time that happened to me...

14429
09:21:06,380 --> 09:21:06,920
Was...

14430
09:21:06,920 --> 09:21:08,120
Four years ago!

14431
09:21:10,000 --> 09:21:10,540
No...

14432
09:21:10,540 --> 09:21:11,360
Three years ago!

14433
09:21:11,700 --> 09:21:12,220
The last...

14434
09:21:12,220 --> 09:21:13,720
Yeah, I reported...

14435
09:21:13,720 --> 09:21:15,040
I said they like...

14436
09:21:15,040 --> 09:21:16,520
Didn't even try to contact me!

14437
09:21:16,740 --> 09:21:18,460
They literally said like...

14438
09:21:18,460 --> 09:21:19,580
I think so!

14439
09:21:19,580 --> 09:21:21,320
I watched them drive away!

14440
09:21:24,700 --> 09:21:26,060
I was looking at the tracker!

14441
09:21:27,640 --> 09:21:28,920
I was looking at the tracker!

14442
09:21:29,240 --> 09:21:31,600
And he was getting further and further away from my place!

14443
09:21:35,980 --> 09:21:36,500
Um...

14444
09:21:36,880 --> 09:21:37,520
I didn't...

14445
09:21:37,520 --> 09:21:38,020
I think...

14446
09:21:38,020 --> 09:21:39,360
Well, I reported it!

14447
09:21:39,440 --> 09:21:41,180
But it didn't give me a refund right away!

14448
09:21:41,800 --> 09:21:42,560
It just...

14449
09:21:42,560 --> 09:21:43,760
It just said like...

14450
09:21:43,760 --> 09:21:45,000
Thank you for the report!

14451
09:21:45,580 --> 09:21:46,880
I didn't get a refund!

14452
09:21:47,200 --> 09:21:48,460
It just says order...

14453
09:21:48,460 --> 09:21:49,840
I'm sad though!

14454
09:21:49,840 --> 09:21:52,560
Like it didn't tell me that it refunded me!

14455
09:21:52,780 --> 09:21:54,260
But I reported it!

14456
09:21:55,480 --> 09:21:56,220
Fuck that guy!

14457
09:21:56,340 --> 09:21:57,140
I won't dox him though!

14458
09:21:59,600 --> 09:22:02,260
I won't say who that guy is!

14459
09:22:05,420 --> 09:22:07,840
He's a top rated career?!

14460
09:22:08,880 --> 09:22:10,320
That's bullshit!

14461
09:22:11,600 --> 09:22:13,840
How is he top rated?!

14462
09:22:15,640 --> 09:22:17,220
That is so...

14463
09:22:17,220 --> 09:22:17,840
He...

14464
09:22:17,840 --> 09:22:18,910
He just...

14465
09:22:19,380 --> 09:22:20,240
Oh my god!

14466
09:22:20,700 --> 09:22:21,560
I'm sad!

14467
09:22:22,940 --> 09:22:24,100
He like...

14468
09:22:24,100 --> 09:22:26,010
It says he's a top rated career!

14469
09:22:27,420 --> 09:22:27,860
That's...

14470
09:22:27,860 --> 09:22:28,900
There's no way!

14471
09:22:29,680 --> 09:22:31,280
He drove away!

14472
09:22:32,320 --> 09:22:33,460
He drove away!

14473
09:22:35,020 --> 09:22:36,440
Wait, I'll give him a bad review!

14474
09:22:36,540 --> 09:22:36,920
You're right!

14475
09:22:37,140 --> 09:22:38,120
Thanks for reminding me!

14476
09:22:38,380 --> 09:22:39,060
Fuck that guy!

14477
09:22:40,240 --> 09:22:41,540
That shit made me mad!

14478
09:22:42,660 --> 09:22:43,680
How do I give a review?

14479
09:22:45,140 --> 09:22:46,620
Oh, I must have...

14480
09:22:46,620 --> 09:22:48,080
No, I couldn't give him a review!

14481
09:22:50,240 --> 09:22:50,680
Wait...

14482
09:22:50,680 --> 09:22:51,680
Because I like...

14483
09:22:52,960 --> 09:22:53,840
Already like...

14484
09:22:53,840 --> 09:22:55,680
Like, you know, when you like...

14485
09:22:55,680 --> 09:22:57,700
Look at something and you're already...

14486
09:22:57,700 --> 09:22:59,260
Tapped off of it!

14487
09:23:00,480 --> 09:23:03,180
But like, I don't know how to get back to it!

14488
09:23:05,100 --> 09:23:06,020
No, I did...

14489
09:23:06,020 --> 09:23:08,160
I called him and it went to voicemail!

14490
09:23:09,060 --> 09:23:11,220
It actually went to voicemail!

14491
09:23:11,360 --> 09:23:12,320
I got really sad!

14492
09:23:16,220 --> 09:23:17,100
Recent orders?

14493
09:23:17,460 --> 09:23:18,500
You do recent orders...

14494
09:23:18,500 --> 09:23:19,740
By the way, I use Uber Eats!

14495
09:23:21,600 --> 09:23:22,200
Um...

14496
09:23:22,200 --> 09:23:23,280
Uber Eats...

14497
09:23:23,280 --> 09:23:24,240
How do I do this?

14498
09:23:24,780 --> 09:23:26,920
I never give people reviews because I don't care!

14499
09:23:27,200 --> 09:23:28,120
But I'm mad!

14500
09:23:29,500 --> 09:23:30,540
Me mad!

14501
09:23:30,760 --> 09:23:31,680
Me not happy!

14502
09:23:33,240 --> 09:23:33,840
Uh...

14503
09:23:33,840 --> 09:23:35,720
Then check the order number!

14504
09:23:37,520 --> 09:23:38,920
How do I do that?

14505
09:23:39,380 --> 09:23:40,460
On Uber Eats?

14506
09:23:43,360 --> 09:23:43,960
Uh...

14507
09:23:45,520 --> 09:23:46,680
Today was just messed up!

14508
09:23:53,420 --> 09:23:54,940
I'm trying to figure out how to get there!

14509
09:23:57,000 --> 09:23:58,280
Yeah, it doesn't say...

14510
09:23:58,280 --> 09:24:00,740
It doesn't tell me if I...

14511
09:24:02,740 --> 09:24:03,220
Uh...

14512
09:24:03,220 --> 09:24:04,220
Yeah, Uber Eats!

14513
09:24:04,500 --> 09:24:06,340
Usually it's not that bad for me!

14514
09:24:07,400 --> 09:24:08,600
I wanna rate the courier!

14515
09:24:09,600 --> 09:24:10,920
I wanna rate you!

14516
09:24:16,100 --> 09:24:19,280
I need to rate you and give you a bad rating!

14517
09:24:22,600 --> 09:24:23,860
It won't let me!

14518
09:24:24,140 --> 09:24:24,280
It won't let me!

14519
09:24:24,280 --> 09:24:24,840
I'm sad!

14520
09:24:28,760 --> 09:24:29,720
That's a lie!

14521
09:24:29,940 --> 09:24:31,140
I said we delivered your order!

14522
09:24:31,340 --> 09:24:32,240
Never delivered!

14523
09:24:34,940 --> 09:24:35,500
How?!

14524
09:24:36,140 --> 09:24:37,540
It won't let me, guys!

14525
09:24:37,840 --> 09:24:38,720
Now I'm more sad!

14526
09:24:39,120 --> 09:24:41,080
I can't give them a bad rating!

14527
09:24:42,220 --> 09:24:43,940
I'm more sad now!

14528
09:24:44,740 --> 09:24:46,780
I, like, tapped out of it, too!

14529
09:24:47,260 --> 09:24:49,940
I can rate the store, but it wasn't the store's fault!

14530
09:24:50,200 --> 09:24:52,120
I wanna rate the fucking delivery man!

14531
09:24:57,200 --> 09:24:58,400
That's not fair!

14532
09:24:59,300 --> 09:25:00,820
It won't let me rate him!

14533
09:25:02,160 --> 09:25:03,260
I'm so sad!

14534
09:25:03,280 --> 09:25:04,360
I don't wanna give...

14535
09:25:04,360 --> 09:25:05,140
Oh my god!

14536
09:25:05,160 --> 09:25:07,040
I don't wanna give, like, the store...

14537
09:25:07,040 --> 09:25:08,460
A bad review!

14538
09:25:11,200 --> 09:25:12,080
Sad!

14539
09:25:12,420 --> 09:25:13,040
Sad!

14540
09:25:13,040 --> 09:25:13,420
Sad kitty!

14541
09:25:14,180 --> 09:25:16,260
At least I had my udon!

14542
09:25:27,380 --> 09:25:29,460
I wish I had my mango...

14543
09:25:30,300 --> 09:25:32,260
My mango drink...

14544
09:25:32,820 --> 09:25:34,420
With my udon!

14545
09:25:37,920 --> 09:25:39,540
I wish I had that!

14546
09:25:43,840 --> 09:25:46,980
I wish he had that with my udon!

14547
09:25:48,440 --> 09:25:50,360
Why don't I have that?

14548
09:25:53,720 --> 09:25:54,980
Select the order...

14549
09:25:55,600 --> 09:25:55,940
And then...

14550
09:25:55,940 --> 09:25:56,580
Yeah, but...

14551
09:25:56,580 --> 09:25:58,000
I don't wanna rate the store!

14552
09:25:58,240 --> 09:25:59,140
I wanna rate the...

14553
09:26:00,660 --> 09:26:01,300
Okay...

14554
09:26:02,260 --> 09:26:03,460
Oh, there you go!

14555
09:26:03,800 --> 09:26:04,660
Rate the store!

14556
09:26:05,860 --> 09:26:06,620
Rate your...

14557
09:26:06,620 --> 09:26:07,260
Oh, I found it!

14558
09:26:08,060 --> 09:26:08,700
Negative!

14559
09:26:12,900 --> 09:26:13,540
Unprofessional!

14560
09:26:13,820 --> 09:26:14,720
Poor communication!

14561
09:26:15,420 --> 09:26:16,540
Missed instructions!

14562
09:26:17,740 --> 09:26:18,300
Edit!

14563
09:26:19,500 --> 09:26:20,620
Zero dollars!

14564
09:26:24,740 --> 09:26:25,820
There we go!

14565
09:26:26,680 --> 09:26:27,040
Some...

14566
09:26:27,040 --> 09:26:28,420
Okay, store I'll give a four!

14567
09:26:28,760 --> 09:26:29,940
Because I didn't get a drink!

14568
09:26:30,200 --> 09:26:31,000
So I'm giving you a...

14569
09:26:33,520 --> 09:26:35,460
You can't write stole your food!

14570
09:26:35,860 --> 09:26:37,220
I wrote poor communication!

14571
09:26:37,540 --> 09:26:38,440
Missed instructions!

14572
09:26:39,460 --> 09:26:40,720
Didn't match photo!

14573
09:26:41,140 --> 09:26:42,460
Because there was no photo!

14574
09:26:47,860 --> 09:26:48,820
There we go!

14575
09:26:49,320 --> 09:26:50,100
Thanks for...

14576
09:26:50,100 --> 09:26:53,540
Dro- I can't write dro- There's no writing, too!

14577
09:26:53,720 --> 09:26:54,440
That's the worst part!

14578
09:26:57,600 --> 09:27:00,520
I can't write that he literally drove away with my food!

14579
09:27:05,770 --> 09:27:07,170
I submitted a report!

14580
09:27:08,370 --> 09:27:10,230
But they haven't given me my money back!

14581
09:27:17,900 --> 09:27:20,120
It just said...

14582
09:27:20,120 --> 09:27:22,180
It literally just said...

14583
09:27:22,180 --> 09:27:24,140
Bro, he didn't even put his real name in there!

14584
09:27:24,640 --> 09:27:24,980
That's...

14585
09:27:24,980 --> 09:27:26,340
He put like...

14586
09:27:29,010 --> 09:27:30,810
He didn't even put a real name!

14587
09:27:33,170 --> 09:27:35,970
It just said...

14588
09:27:38,870 --> 09:27:50,090
It just said...

14589
09:27:52,130 --> 09:27:53,490
That's the worst part!

14590
09:28:01,760 --> 09:28:03,880
Oh yeah, they were like...

14591
09:28:03,880 --> 09:28:06,200
The order didn't arrive...

14592
09:28:06,200 --> 09:28:07,800
Where did my clinics go?

14593
09:28:08,140 --> 09:28:08,820
Did I use...

14594
09:28:08,820 --> 09:28:10,360
No, I couldn't have used all of it!

14595
09:28:10,420 --> 09:28:11,660
I literally just opened it!

14596
09:28:12,320 --> 09:28:13,440
Oh, it's on the ground!

14597
09:28:13,500 --> 09:28:14,460
I put it on the ground!

14598
09:28:18,460 --> 09:28:30,610
I put it on the ground!

14599
09:28:33,190 --> 09:28:34,370
I don't know!

14600
09:28:34,690 --> 09:28:35,130
I don't know!

14601
09:28:35,130 --> 09:28:35,190
I don't know!

14602
09:28:35,190 --> 09:28:35,450
He knew!

14603
09:28:41,400 --> 09:28:42,720
I would've done something!

14604
09:28:43,780 --> 09:28:45,300
Don't make Joe Kitty mad!

14605
09:28:50,190 --> 09:28:50,950
I know!

14606
09:28:51,110 --> 09:28:52,570
I should be streaming on...

14607
09:28:52,570 --> 09:28:53,510
On Twitch!

14608
09:28:53,830 --> 09:28:55,110
When I do these long sessions!

14609
09:28:55,490 --> 09:28:56,790
But I couldn't help it!

14610
09:29:00,050 --> 09:29:00,990
It's like...

14611
09:29:00,990 --> 09:29:03,690
Free fit- It's like therapy that never ends for me!

14612
09:29:13,280 --> 09:29:14,560
And all I'm saying...

14613
09:29:15,560 --> 09:29:16,840
I literally...

14614
09:29:16,840 --> 09:29:17,380
Guys!

14615
09:29:17,720 --> 09:29:18,980
I literally lost my drink!

14616
09:29:19,580 --> 09:29:21,580
This therapy session needs to keep going!

14617
09:29:25,740 --> 09:29:28,700
This therapy session needs to keep on going!

14618
09:29:29,260 --> 09:29:30,400
I lost my drink!

14619
09:29:32,280 --> 09:29:34,280
I need to feel something!

14620
09:29:34,280 --> 09:29:35,820
I am not!

14621
09:29:36,700 --> 09:29:37,940
I am not!

14622
09:29:38,620 --> 09:29:41,200
I am

14623
09:29:49,380 --> 09:29:49,380
not!

14624
09:29:49,380 --> 09:29:49,920
I am not!

14625
09:29:49,920 --> 09:29:50,760
Dr. Rivals!

14626
09:29:52,480 --> 09:29:53,240
Today...

14627
09:29:53,240 --> 09:29:55,600
Today my Uber Eats driver...

14628
09:29:56,240 --> 09:29:57,920
Took away my drink!

14629
09:29:58,660 --> 09:30:01,020
Wait, what is it Dr. Rivals?

14630
09:30:01,920 --> 09:30:02,920
My prescri...

14631
09:30:03,120 --> 09:30:06,640
You gotta prescribe me with three more hours of more...

14632
09:30:06,640 --> 09:30:07,300
Rivals?

14633
09:30:08,240 --> 09:30:10,700
To help forget the bad things in life?

14634
09:30:10,700 --> 09:30:12,040
Oh my...

14635
09:30:12,040 --> 09:30:13,560
Thank you, Dr. Rivals!

14636
09:30:14,100 --> 09:30:17,360
Oh my...

14637
09:30:17,360 --> 09:30:19,620
Thank you, Dr. Rivals!

14638
09:30:19,900 --> 09:30:20,700
Wow!

14639
09:30:22,860 --> 09:30:24,860
What a great idea!

14640
09:30:32,930 --> 09:30:33,850
My prescri...

14641
09:30:33,850 --> 09:30:35,610
The only cure...

14642
09:30:36,030 --> 09:30:37,390
To be less sad...

14643
09:30:38,110 --> 09:30:40,410
Is more Marvel Rivals?

14644
09:30:41,170 --> 09:30:41,570
Wow!

14645
09:30:42,030 --> 09:30:44,810
I hope that's not a conflict of interest, Dr. Rivals!

14646
09:30:44,810 --> 09:30:45,650
It's not!

14647
09:30:45,930 --> 09:30:47,070
You're so right!

14648
09:30:51,510 --> 09:30:53,050
Okay, two and a half!

14649
09:30:53,600 --> 09:30:54,430
Two and a half!

14650
09:30:54,550 --> 09:30:56,050
And then I start my Twitch stream!

14651
09:30:57,390 --> 09:30:58,050
Imagine!

14652
09:30:58,770 --> 09:30:59,430
Imagine!

14653
09:30:59,630 --> 09:31:01,070
Two and a half hours!

14654
09:31:01,690 --> 09:31:02,330
And then I...

14655
09:31:02,330 --> 09:31:08,310
I end it and I start the Twitch stream for more Marvel Rivals!

14656
09:31:08,310 --> 09:31:09,690
What do I just...

14657
09:31:09,990 --> 09:31:13,510
What do I just...

14658
09:31:13,510 --> 09:31:14,850
Toki, please!

14659
09:31:17,090 --> 09:31:17,490
Unless...

14660
09:31:17,890 --> 09:31:20,290
That's just a joke right, Toki?

14661
09:31:20,570 --> 09:31:22,310
That's such a funny joke!

14662
09:31:22,930 --> 09:31:24,070
He he ha ha!

14663
09:31:28,870 --> 09:31:29,670
Unました...

14664
09:31:35,570 --> 09:31:38,430
Guys, she won't actually do that, right, guys?

14665
09:31:38,650 --> 09:31:40,530
She's only just joking.

14666
09:31:44,640 --> 09:31:45,700
So funny.

14667
09:31:48,780 --> 09:31:50,720
Blackfire, thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

14668
09:31:50,880 --> 09:31:51,160
Thank you.

14669
09:31:51,320 --> 09:31:51,900
Thank you.

14670
09:31:55,780 --> 09:31:56,560
I'm done.

14671
09:31:59,920 --> 09:32:01,040
I'm done eating.

14672
09:32:01,380 --> 09:32:02,500
Do what you want.

14673
09:32:02,760 --> 09:32:04,300
Don't tempt me for a good time.

14674
09:32:06,040 --> 09:32:09,040
The thing is, I enjoy it.

14675
09:32:11,500 --> 09:32:12,820
That's the thing.

14676
09:32:13,320 --> 09:32:16,180
I actually enjoy doing what I do.

14677
09:32:16,500 --> 09:32:19,240
And that is long grinding sessions.

14678
09:32:20,240 --> 09:32:22,260
It's about what you guys want.

14679
09:32:24,720 --> 09:32:26,820
Which I will take into consideration.

14680
09:32:27,920 --> 09:32:28,800
More pause.

14681
09:32:29,000 --> 09:32:29,120
Bye.

14682
09:32:29,240 --> 09:32:30,900
Thank you for the 5 gifted chips.

14683
09:32:31,720 --> 09:32:32,060
Thank you.

14684
09:32:32,220 --> 09:32:32,680
Thank you.

14685
09:32:33,080 --> 09:32:34,120
Alright, let me wash my hands.

14686
09:32:34,300 --> 09:32:36,740
And then...

14687
09:32:37,260 --> 09:32:38,020
That would be good.

14688
09:32:47,280 --> 09:32:47,680
Alright.

14689
09:32:49,940 --> 09:32:50,560
How are you?

14690
09:32:52,100 --> 09:32:52,980
So you washed my hands?

14691
09:32:53,100 --> 09:32:54,500
Oh, there it is.

14692
09:32:54,980 --> 09:32:55,300
Alright.

14693
09:32:57,060 --> 09:32:57,580
Alright.

14694
09:32:57,580 --> 09:32:58,480
I washed my hands.

14695
09:32:59,860 --> 09:33:00,380
Alright.

14696
09:33:00,960 --> 09:33:03,100
I'll play... I'll say I still kiddie, guys.

14697
09:33:03,620 --> 09:33:05,600
Just because I'm a good person.

14698
09:33:06,500 --> 09:33:10,220
Um, let me just make sure I do it correctly.

14699
09:33:11,360 --> 09:33:12,340
Oh, okay.

14700
09:33:12,560 --> 09:33:13,600
I just want to make sure...

14701
09:33:13,600 --> 09:33:16,720
Oh, let me turn this off real fast.

14702
09:33:16,880 --> 09:33:17,140
Alright.

14703
09:33:19,680 --> 09:33:20,700
Poof, I'm back.

14704
09:33:21,120 --> 09:33:22,620
Alright, let me swap over.

14705
09:33:29,420 --> 09:33:30,980
Okay, I'm ready.

14706
09:33:31,940 --> 09:33:32,600
Alright.

14707
09:33:33,040 --> 09:33:34,000
I'm getting back on.

14708
09:33:35,640 --> 09:33:36,260
Sorry.

14709
09:33:36,540 --> 09:33:37,220
Sorry.

14710
09:33:37,420 --> 09:33:38,520
That was our mini...

14711
09:33:38,520 --> 09:33:41,960
Our mini Goodnight Dragoons was interrupted by...

14712
09:33:41,960 --> 09:33:44,460
The fact that my drinks got kidnapped.

14713
09:33:44,980 --> 09:33:45,740
Oh my...

14714
09:33:51,830 --> 09:33:53,250
I'm so sad.

14715
09:33:56,690 --> 09:33:58,910
I'm so sad, guys.

14716
09:34:04,310 --> 09:34:05,750
I wanted...

14717
09:34:05,750 --> 09:34:08,410
I've been drinking water for so long.

14718
09:34:08,930 --> 09:34:11,750
I wanted to drink something else.

14719
09:34:13,370 --> 09:34:17,650
I wanted to drink my mango drink.

14720
09:34:20,290 --> 09:34:21,730
Stupid PV.

14721
09:34:22,670 --> 09:34:23,250
Fuck you.

14722
09:34:24,410 --> 09:34:27,090
I hope you get fired from Uber Eats.

14723
09:34:27,290 --> 09:34:27,870
That's right.

14724
09:34:28,110 --> 09:34:29,730
And I'm not joking.

14725
09:34:30,290 --> 09:34:33,550
I hope they get fired from Uber Eats.

14726
09:34:33,550 --> 09:34:34,950
Top rated career.

14727
09:34:35,170 --> 09:34:36,310
My fucking ass.

14728
09:34:39,400 --> 09:34:40,500
I know!

14729
09:34:40,720 --> 09:34:42,340
The fact that it's back to back!

14730
09:34:42,340 --> 09:34:43,640
How unlucky...

14731
09:34:43,640 --> 09:34:44,580
Can I be?

14732
09:34:45,020 --> 09:34:46,280
That it was...

14733
09:34:46,280 --> 09:34:47,040
Back to back.

14734
09:34:50,190 --> 09:34:53,010
Like, that's the most fucked up part.

14735
09:34:55,190 --> 09:34:56,490
Alright, I'm ready.

14736
09:35:00,100 --> 09:35:01,500
Has Pizza been winning?

14737
09:35:02,340 --> 09:35:03,320
Oh, yes.

14738
09:35:04,380 --> 09:35:05,600
Good for him.

14739
09:35:06,700 --> 09:35:09,480
Oh, is that the last streak he was telling me about?

14740
09:35:11,920 --> 09:35:12,500
No?

14741
09:35:14,040 --> 09:35:14,620
No?

14742
09:35:15,100 --> 09:35:16,900
Oh, that's when he joins, right?

14743
09:35:17,440 --> 09:35:19,340
It wasn't that bad of a last streak.

14744
09:35:25,000 --> 09:35:26,620
It wasn't that bad.

14745
09:35:27,840 --> 09:35:28,400
Ugh.

14746
09:35:28,900 --> 09:35:30,640
Like, it started here.

14747
09:35:31,760 --> 09:35:32,840
Started here.

14748
09:35:33,280 --> 09:35:33,760
Wait, no.

14749
09:35:33,840 --> 09:35:34,760
It started here.

14750
09:35:36,540 --> 09:35:38,360
That's not even a last streak!

14751
09:35:38,440 --> 09:35:39,400
Why was he crying?

14752
09:35:39,840 --> 09:35:42,400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

14753
09:35:43,500 --> 09:35:45,400
6, 7, 8...

14754
09:35:46,700 --> 09:35:47,580
Wait, no.

14755
09:35:48,780 --> 09:35:49,740
Yeah, he didn't even loot.

14756
09:35:49,880 --> 09:35:50,080
Wait.

14757
09:35:51,060 --> 09:35:51,620
Okay.

14758
09:35:53,880 --> 09:35:54,520
Okay.

14759
09:35:54,980 --> 09:35:55,860
Ended here.

14760
09:35:56,100 --> 09:35:56,180
Okay.

14761
09:35:56,380 --> 09:35:58,820
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

14762
09:35:59,580 --> 09:36:00,680
6 games.

14763
09:36:01,000 --> 09:36:01,380
7.

14764
09:36:01,780 --> 09:36:02,960
7 games.

14765
09:36:03,220 --> 09:36:04,200
7 games.

14766
09:36:04,380 --> 09:36:04,920
And he...

14767
09:36:05,760 --> 09:36:06,080
He...

14768
09:36:06,400 --> 09:36:07,680
1, 3...

14769
09:36:07,680 --> 09:36:07,920
Oh, yeah.

14770
09:36:07,920 --> 09:36:08,760
No, that's a bad...

14771
09:36:08,760 --> 09:36:10,080
It's 3-7.

14772
09:36:10,520 --> 09:36:11,000
Never mind.

14773
09:36:11,880 --> 09:36:12,800
Never mind.

14774
09:36:12,940 --> 09:36:14,080
It was a 3-7 record.

14775
09:36:14,220 --> 09:36:14,880
That's pretty bad.

14776
09:36:17,820 --> 09:36:19,100
Never mind.

14777
09:36:20,420 --> 09:36:21,700
He went...

14778
09:36:21,700 --> 09:36:22,660
3-7.

14779
09:36:22,660 --> 09:36:23,980
Okay, yeah.

14780
09:36:26,340 --> 09:36:27,940
Is audio too loud?

14781
09:36:28,760 --> 09:36:29,460
No.

14782
09:36:30,620 --> 09:36:33,520
Oh, you mean audio was too low.

14783
09:36:33,980 --> 09:36:34,240
Oh.

14784
09:36:35,300 --> 09:36:36,860
Yeah, it didn't look...

14785
09:36:36,860 --> 09:36:38,320
It didn't look that bad.

14786
09:36:40,700 --> 09:36:42,180
Look pretty alright.

14787
09:36:48,680 --> 09:36:50,920
I'm ready to gain more.

14788
09:36:52,360 --> 09:36:54,240
I'm ready to suffer.

14789
09:37:00,700 --> 09:37:03,320
Mr. Broken Bond, your curse already...

14790
09:37:03,320 --> 09:37:06,240
Your curse already hit...

14791
09:37:06,240 --> 09:37:08,460
Hit my drink, guys.

14792
09:37:08,460 --> 09:37:09,560
I...

14793
09:37:09,560 --> 09:37:09,840
I...

14794
09:37:10,780 --> 09:37:11,380
Like...

14795
09:37:11,380 --> 09:37:13,640
How much more do you want from me?

14796
09:37:13,820 --> 09:37:16,600
I already lost my drink, Broken Bond.

14797
09:37:17,560 --> 09:37:19,540
How much more do you want?

14798
09:37:20,360 --> 09:37:22,580
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

14799
09:37:26,580 --> 09:37:27,720
I'm Luna Snow.

14800
09:37:28,060 --> 09:37:29,020
Like the moon...

14801
09:37:29,020 --> 09:37:30,680
I already lost my drink.

14802
09:37:31,400 --> 09:37:33,540
I don't have anything more.

14803
09:37:42,020 --> 09:37:43,900
Oh, my tail might be a little distracting.

14804
09:37:44,140 --> 09:37:45,500
Let me, uh...

14805
09:37:45,500 --> 09:37:46,560
No, that's my jingle jangle.

14806
09:37:46,800 --> 09:37:47,940
Jingle jangle jangle.

14807
09:37:49,280 --> 09:37:51,540
Jingle jangle jangle.

14808
09:37:52,600 --> 09:37:54,160
Jingle jangle jangle.

14809
09:37:58,080 --> 09:37:59,920
Are you guys paying your attention?

14810
09:38:00,300 --> 09:38:01,720
Jingle jangle jangle.

14811
09:38:08,510 --> 09:38:10,950
The cat's baby keys.

14812
09:38:17,190 --> 09:38:19,310
Alright, now you'll be fully locked in.

14813
09:38:20,690 --> 09:38:20,870
Oh.

14814
09:38:22,130 --> 09:38:22,890
Guys.

14815
09:38:24,050 --> 09:38:25,850
Oh, you guys might be...

14816
09:38:25,850 --> 09:38:26,030
Okay.

14817
09:38:26,570 --> 09:38:27,730
You guys might be lucky.

14818
09:38:28,410 --> 09:38:29,070
Guys.

14819
09:38:29,990 --> 09:38:30,450
Because.

14820
09:38:32,090 --> 09:38:34,390
The food's hitting hard now.

14821
09:38:35,950 --> 09:38:37,390
Pick your hero.

14822
09:38:37,670 --> 09:38:38,450
Or villain.

14823
09:38:38,830 --> 09:38:39,330
I'm joking.

14824
09:38:39,890 --> 09:38:40,990
Oh, no.

14825
09:38:42,450 --> 09:38:43,490
The food coma.

14826
09:38:43,910 --> 09:38:44,870
I'm comfy.

14827
09:38:45,450 --> 09:38:47,710
I'm comfy with the food.

14828
09:38:50,530 --> 09:38:51,630
Oh, no.

14829
09:38:52,350 --> 09:38:53,830
Alright, the adrenaline will kick in.

14830
09:38:54,190 --> 09:38:54,330
Maybe.

14831
09:38:54,710 --> 09:38:55,770
Jingle jangle jangle.

14832
09:38:56,430 --> 09:38:56,570
Jingle jangle.

14833
09:38:56,590 --> 09:38:57,410
Jingle jangle.

14834
09:39:06,910 --> 09:39:10,990
If I had my mango drink, it wouldn't, because there would be sugar in it.

14835
09:39:11,110 --> 09:39:12,230
But I didn't have my sugar.

14836
09:39:12,510 --> 09:39:13,930
Music makes people happy.

14837
09:39:14,430 --> 09:39:15,590
Heroes make them safe.

14838
09:39:16,430 --> 09:39:17,090
Maybe I can...

14839
09:39:17,090 --> 09:39:17,510
You're right.

14840
09:39:17,750 --> 09:39:19,070
My top 500.

14841
09:39:19,310 --> 09:39:21,490
What if I take a nap and then start on Twitter?

14842
09:39:22,010 --> 09:39:22,550
I'm joking.

14843
09:39:22,850 --> 09:39:23,230
I'm joking.

14844
09:39:24,870 --> 09:39:26,670
I won't do that to you guys.

14845
09:39:30,050 --> 09:39:31,710
I'll see how I feel.

14846
09:39:32,310 --> 09:39:36,070
No, but you should know magnetism doesn't work on super cooled materials.

14847
09:39:36,410 --> 09:39:37,650
Guess what I can do.

14848
09:39:38,930 --> 09:39:40,870
Why don't I do sprays for this?

14849
09:39:42,910 --> 09:39:44,590
What's the spray for this game?

14850
09:39:44,590 --> 09:39:50,010
The battle starts in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

14851
09:39:52,370 --> 09:39:53,290
Alright, nice.

14852
09:40:01,090 --> 09:40:01,690
Alright.

14853
09:40:07,640 --> 09:40:08,820
Alright, here we go.

14854
09:40:10,100 --> 09:40:11,220
Oh, they have a Jeff.

14855
09:40:12,100 --> 09:40:13,420
Oh, but we're already tripped.

14856
09:40:13,580 --> 09:40:14,500
Oh, they have a...

14857
09:40:15,160 --> 09:40:18,280
They have everything that makes me sad.

14858
09:40:23,680 --> 09:40:26,500
Just ignoring... Oh my god, the stairs actually fucked me up.

14859
09:40:30,530 --> 09:40:32,290
Please, please just keep me up.

14860
09:40:32,550 --> 09:40:32,910
No!

14861
09:40:35,210 --> 09:40:37,290
I needed him to heal me!

14862
09:40:37,630 --> 09:40:38,150
Metis!

14863
09:40:39,410 --> 09:40:39,930
No!

14864
09:40:43,160 --> 09:40:44,080
Oh, my team's got it.

14865
09:40:44,200 --> 09:40:44,520
It's fine.

14866
09:40:44,820 --> 09:40:46,760
I'm just the person that dies, I guess.

14867
09:40:53,480 --> 09:40:54,220
There we go.

14868
09:40:55,440 --> 09:40:55,920
Thank you.

14869
09:40:56,600 --> 09:40:58,940
I will save my hero.

14870
09:40:59,560 --> 09:41:00,800
I like this whore.

14871
09:41:06,500 --> 09:41:10,060
I remember what they did to me.

14872
09:41:12,940 --> 09:41:15,760
I healed her, but we're my heal.

14873
09:41:16,020 --> 09:41:17,820
We're my heal, huh?

14874
09:41:21,100 --> 09:41:22,180
Heal where?

14875
09:41:27,920 --> 09:41:29,240
Okay, I'm made.

14876
09:41:32,840 --> 09:41:34,140
Oh my god, I like missed.

14877
09:41:35,620 --> 09:41:36,060
Missed.

14878
09:41:36,380 --> 09:41:37,600
But it's a hit, they don't know.

14879
09:41:38,380 --> 09:41:39,600
They don't know I missed.

14880
09:41:40,140 --> 09:41:42,160
That's the best part, they'll never know.

14881
09:41:42,700 --> 09:41:44,300
The mistakes I make.

14882
09:41:46,980 --> 09:41:48,640
I hear him, I hear the Jeff.

14883
09:41:54,600 --> 09:41:56,060
Okay, I'm like 99.

14884
09:41:57,800 --> 09:41:58,400
I swear.

14885
09:41:58,520 --> 09:42:00,300
If I don't get healed, I will fucking...

14886
09:42:01,220 --> 09:42:02,820
I will report you.

14887
09:42:07,760 --> 09:42:09,340
I believe in my item.

14888
09:42:12,160 --> 09:42:13,780
Oh, please.

14889
09:42:14,160 --> 09:42:15,160
Please be okay.

14890
09:42:16,680 --> 09:42:18,820
Oh, what the fu- Oh, he blocked it.

14891
09:42:20,980 --> 09:42:21,280
Goodbye.

14892
09:42:22,500 --> 09:42:23,980
Okay, we didn't need that.

14893
09:42:24,080 --> 09:42:25,360
Oh my god.

14894
09:42:25,560 --> 09:42:26,680
Oh my god.

14895
09:42:26,680 --> 09:42:27,720
I am scared.

14896
09:42:28,020 --> 09:42:28,620
I...

14897
09:42:31,640 --> 09:42:32,920
Oh, please.

14898
09:42:33,980 --> 09:42:34,580
Okay.

14899
09:42:35,540 --> 09:42:36,140
Okay.

14900
09:42:37,520 --> 09:42:39,700
I did not know where my mag was.

14901
09:42:39,960 --> 09:42:41,140
Where was my mag?

14902
09:42:41,800 --> 09:42:42,280
Where...

14903
09:42:42,280 --> 09:42:44,080
Where the fu- was my mag?

14904
09:42:44,340 --> 09:42:44,780
I...

14905
09:42:44,780 --> 09:42:46,200
I need to know.

14906
09:42:47,440 --> 09:42:47,920
Where...

14907
09:42:47,920 --> 09:42:50,200
I was trying to find him.

14908
09:42:53,600 --> 09:42:54,840
No, it was just unlucky.

14909
09:42:54,880 --> 09:42:57,080
I was literally trying to find my mag, but I literally...

14910
09:42:57,080 --> 09:42:58,120
I didn't know where he was.

14911
09:42:58,960 --> 09:43:00,160
I was so confused.

14912
09:43:04,580 --> 09:43:05,660
Oh my god.

14913
09:43:06,040 --> 09:43:06,940
What the fu-

14914
09:43:10,650 --> 09:43:11,630
Don't look at me.

14915
09:43:11,630 --> 09:43:12,730
If I don't look at you.

14916
09:43:13,970 --> 09:43:15,350
If you heal me, I'll heal you.

14917
09:43:15,470 --> 09:43:16,710
If you heal me, I'll heal you.

14918
09:43:16,890 --> 09:43:18,730
It is called the circle of life.

14919
09:43:22,190 --> 09:43:22,670
Okay.

14920
09:43:23,370 --> 09:43:23,530
Nice.

14921
09:43:27,450 --> 09:43:29,430
Oh, that is way too early.

14922
09:43:29,750 --> 09:43:31,530
That is way too early.

14923
09:43:31,790 --> 09:43:33,330
That is not the best part.

14924
09:43:36,810 --> 09:43:37,870
He's alive though.

14925
09:43:38,470 --> 09:43:39,550
Yeah, I was like...

14926
09:43:39,550 --> 09:43:40,070
Wow.

14927
09:43:40,070 --> 09:43:40,990
We...

14928
09:43:40,990 --> 09:43:43,430
I was not expecting it to be that early.

14929
09:43:44,510 --> 09:43:45,290
Oh, nice.

14930
09:43:45,530 --> 09:43:45,650
Wait.

14931
09:43:45,750 --> 09:43:46,050
He's one.

14932
09:43:46,450 --> 09:43:47,330
Oh, not nice.

14933
09:43:47,510 --> 09:43:48,690
We let him fly away.

14934
09:43:50,790 --> 09:43:51,570
For free.

14935
09:43:52,570 --> 09:43:53,730
Just let him do that.

14936
09:43:56,390 --> 09:43:56,970
All right.

14937
09:43:57,310 --> 09:43:57,570
Come on.

14938
09:43:59,170 --> 09:44:00,810
And there's a shark there.

14939
09:44:04,330 --> 09:44:04,990
He's one.

14940
09:44:05,090 --> 09:44:06,150
Please don't let him do this again.

14941
09:44:06,570 --> 09:44:06,650
Please.

14942
09:44:06,850 --> 09:44:07,390
Oh, thank God.

14943
09:44:07,590 --> 09:44:07,710
Okay.

14944
09:44:09,570 --> 09:44:10,490
Jingle jangle.

14945
09:44:15,230 --> 09:44:16,050
Jingle jangle.

14946
09:44:16,250 --> 09:44:16,550
Jingle jangle.

14947
09:44:25,520 --> 09:44:26,360
Jingle jangle.

14948
09:44:32,680 --> 09:44:33,600
Jingle jangle.

14949
09:44:33,600 --> 09:44:34,140
Hello, dragons.

14950
09:44:40,860 --> 09:44:42,900
I don't imagine it's going to be like...

14951
09:44:42,900 --> 09:44:47,580
Doki, why did you not stream your later half of the rink ride on Twitch, Doki?

14952
09:44:49,740 --> 09:44:51,920
You could have gotten so much more.

14953
09:44:52,860 --> 09:44:54,900
Maybe you could add me to your playlist.

14954
09:44:55,700 --> 09:44:55,740
Maybe you could add me to your playlist.

14955
09:44:55,740 --> 09:44:57,900
Well, I'm really more of a classic rock kind of guy, you know.

14956
09:44:58,900 --> 09:44:59,320
Whoops.

14957
09:45:03,980 --> 09:45:05,960
Why does this person think he has rights?

14958
09:45:05,960 --> 09:45:09,320
Four, three, two, one!

14959
09:45:23,280 --> 09:45:25,320
You think I do that for free?

14960
09:45:31,910 --> 09:45:32,510
That's...

14961
09:45:32,510 --> 09:45:34,910
You go get that shit for free?

14962
09:45:37,670 --> 09:45:39,510
Especially when I lost my drink.

14963
09:45:45,050 --> 09:45:46,970
What the fuck is this Jeff doing?

14964
09:45:49,150 --> 09:45:50,550
Like, I'll just stay here.

14965
09:45:52,770 --> 09:45:53,590
Like, it's fine.

14966
09:45:53,650 --> 09:45:54,210
We have points.

14967
09:45:54,530 --> 09:45:55,890
Wait, why didn't he not get points?

14968
09:45:58,470 --> 09:45:59,670
Okay, I did that.

14969
09:45:59,870 --> 09:46:01,990
Just because, like, I was worried for my Mantis.

14970
09:46:05,450 --> 09:46:07,650
I wanted my Mantis to...

14971
09:46:07,650 --> 09:46:08,010
Woah!

14972
09:46:08,910 --> 09:46:10,050
Oh my god!

14973
09:46:12,130 --> 09:46:12,770
Please.

14974
09:46:13,570 --> 09:46:14,490
Oh my god, thank you.

14975
09:46:15,450 --> 09:46:17,330
Oh my god.

14976
09:46:21,690 --> 09:46:22,330
Nice.

14977
09:46:25,850 --> 09:46:26,490
Nice.

14978
09:46:26,770 --> 09:46:26,870
Alright.

14979
09:46:27,270 --> 09:46:28,230
We got it.

14980
09:46:32,660 --> 09:46:33,960
We did it, guys.

14981
09:46:36,280 --> 09:46:37,800
He's a pro player.

14982
09:46:37,920 --> 09:46:39,160
He won a tournament!

14983
09:46:42,640 --> 09:46:45,440
He literally told me he won a tournament!

14984
09:46:53,260 --> 09:46:53,940
Oh.

14985
09:46:53,940 --> 09:46:54,620
Gomez.

14986
09:46:54,860 --> 09:46:55,860
He won a tournament today.

14987
09:46:56,200 --> 09:46:56,980
Goodbye, Emma.

14988
09:46:57,940 --> 09:46:59,320
Oh, goodbye, Emma.

14989
09:46:59,720 --> 09:47:01,580
Oh, goodbye, Emma.

14990
09:47:01,820 --> 09:47:02,060
Oh, goodbye, Emma.

14991
09:47:02,060 --> 09:47:03,380
Oh, he's alive!

14992
09:47:03,620 --> 09:47:04,540
He's alive!

14993
09:47:05,520 --> 09:47:06,740
Oh my god!

14994
09:47:06,740 --> 09:47:07,060
What?

14995
09:47:07,280 --> 09:47:09,160
I actually did not expect him to be alive.

14996
09:47:11,260 --> 09:47:14,280
If you guys didn't know, Gomez is on the Sentinels.

14997
09:47:15,840 --> 09:47:17,220
Uh... Team Sentinels.

14998
09:47:17,460 --> 09:47:19,060
Oh, I'm a... Oh, that's scary.

14999
09:47:19,300 --> 09:47:20,360
That was a scary freeze.

15000
09:47:20,880 --> 09:47:22,540
Only because, um...

15001
09:47:23,220 --> 09:47:23,880
I have a ball.

15002
09:47:24,220 --> 09:47:26,540
Um, I could have got a headshot, but...

15003
09:47:31,780 --> 09:47:32,260
Okay.

15004
09:47:32,660 --> 09:47:34,420
Oh, I thought I got the freeze there.

15005
09:47:35,020 --> 09:47:37,260
Okay, I need to avoid this, Jeff.

15006
09:47:37,480 --> 09:47:39,060
This Jeff is actually a troll.

15007
09:47:40,020 --> 09:47:40,940
It's okay.

15008
09:47:41,200 --> 09:47:41,540
Admit it.

15009
09:47:41,580 --> 09:47:42,980
I will...

15010
09:47:42,980 --> 09:47:43,520
Oh.

15011
09:47:44,920 --> 09:47:45,600
Okay.

15012
09:47:46,360 --> 09:47:47,040
Really?

15013
09:47:47,400 --> 09:47:48,660
That's embarrassing.

15014
09:47:53,580 --> 09:47:54,140
Did they?

15015
09:47:54,600 --> 09:47:55,860
Wait, did they lose?

15016
09:47:56,040 --> 09:47:57,160
I thought they won today.

15017
09:47:59,760 --> 09:48:00,500
I asked.

15018
09:48:00,560 --> 09:48:01,820
They said he... Unless he lied.

15019
09:48:05,040 --> 09:48:07,120
Look our Mantis account.

15020
09:48:07,720 --> 09:48:08,240
Why?

15021
09:48:10,460 --> 09:48:11,840
Oh, accuracy.

15022
09:48:12,260 --> 09:48:12,380
Oh.

15023
09:48:15,200 --> 09:48:16,480
Bad game.

15024
09:48:16,760 --> 09:48:17,540
Bad game.

15025
09:48:18,100 --> 09:48:19,640
Wait, let me avoid...

15026
09:48:20,280 --> 09:48:21,380
Are you serious?

15027
09:48:21,480 --> 09:48:22,120
99?

15028
09:48:23,440 --> 09:48:24,820
Oh my god.

15029
09:48:26,660 --> 09:48:28,220
Okay, that's fucked up.

15030
09:48:28,680 --> 09:48:29,540
I'm gonna avoid him.

15031
09:48:31,440 --> 09:48:33,580
Rice, thank you for the Akasupa.

15032
09:48:33,580 --> 09:48:34,620
Thank you, thank you.

15033
09:48:34,620 --> 09:48:34,900
Okay.

15034
09:48:35,960 --> 09:48:36,520
Okay.

15035
09:48:36,760 --> 09:48:38,000
I'll give you fish.

15036
09:48:38,320 --> 09:48:39,580
Just cause it's you.

15037
09:48:40,420 --> 09:48:41,700
Just cause it's you.

15038
09:48:42,140 --> 09:48:43,320
I'll give fish.

15039
09:48:44,920 --> 09:48:45,480
Alright.

15040
09:48:45,780 --> 09:48:46,540
Where's fish?

15041
09:48:48,460 --> 09:48:50,040
Where did I put fish?

15042
09:48:54,340 --> 09:48:55,660
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum.

15043
09:48:57,000 --> 09:48:58,000
It's fish time.

15044
09:48:58,740 --> 09:48:59,560
Jingle, jangle, jingle.

15045
09:49:02,220 --> 09:49:03,240
Wait, you don't see it.

15046
09:49:03,300 --> 09:49:03,780
I see it.

15047
09:49:03,920 --> 09:49:04,100
He, he.

15048
09:49:05,700 --> 09:49:06,700
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

15049
09:49:07,120 --> 09:49:07,960
Jingle, jangle, jingle.

15050
09:49:10,160 --> 09:49:12,900
See, I didn't do this during the Fleshtuber tournament.

15051
09:49:13,160 --> 09:49:14,740
Because I didn't want to seem weird.

15052
09:49:18,240 --> 09:49:30,160
If, if, like, the people who are at the Fleshtuber, the, the Marvel Rivals tournament, and, like, their chat, turn on, like, my stream, and they see this, I think they'll think I'm weird.

15053
09:49:35,940 --> 09:49:38,520
I think they'll be like, what is she doing?

15054
09:49:41,760 --> 09:49:43,340
They'll never understand.

15055
09:49:43,920 --> 09:49:44,440
Exactly.

15056
09:49:44,980 --> 09:49:46,440
They won't understand.

15057
09:49:48,820 --> 09:49:51,280
But now, now, we're here.

15058
09:49:51,940 --> 09:49:55,380
Now, who am I gonna vanish from this match?

15059
09:49:56,500 --> 09:49:57,740
Embrace your credit.

15060
09:50:01,480 --> 09:50:03,120
They give it out to Super again.

15061
09:50:03,280 --> 09:50:04,060
I really appreciate it.

15062
09:50:04,160 --> 09:50:05,060
Thank you, thank you.

15063
09:50:12,440 --> 09:50:13,700
You just would, exactly.

15064
09:50:13,880 --> 09:50:15,640
They just wouldn't get it, okay?

15065
09:50:16,040 --> 09:50:18,240
They just, they just wouldn't get it.

15066
09:50:23,380 --> 09:50:25,360
And this is why I'm also not on Twitch.

15067
09:50:29,700 --> 09:50:33,700
The people who come by, the front page people won't get it either.

15068
09:50:34,360 --> 09:50:38,120
The people on the Rivals page won't understand as well.

15069
09:50:46,560 --> 09:50:47,980
They don't get it.

15070
09:50:48,600 --> 09:50:49,120
They

15071
09:50:53,850 --> 09:50:53,850
don't get it.

15072
09:50:53,850 --> 09:50:55,110
Could make all the difference.

15073
09:50:55,250 --> 09:50:55,370
I'm gonna jangle.

15074
09:51:00,450 --> 09:51:02,670
Don't you love jingling the Jangles?

15075
09:51:08,210 --> 09:51:08,730
Exactly.

15076
09:51:08,910 --> 09:51:10,890
They're not full of whimsy and joy like me.

15077
09:51:11,150 --> 09:51:11,230
Go go.

15078
09:51:11,310 --> 09:51:11,470
Go go.

15079
09:51:11,470 --> 09:51:11,570
Go go.

15080
09:51:11,570 --> 09:51:11,590
Go go.

15081
09:51:12,790 --> 09:51:13,770
Go go.

15082
09:51:14,330 --> 09:51:15,070
Go go.

15083
09:51:15,890 --> 09:51:17,050
Go go go go.

15084
09:51:17,050 --> 09:51:20,230
Did I just hear the fire alarm beep?

15085
09:51:20,750 --> 09:51:22,630
Did I just hear the fire alarm beep?

15086
09:51:22,630 --> 09:51:23,570
A lot of things went.

15087
09:51:25,310 --> 09:51:26,690
You worried about the wrong thing?

15088
09:51:28,070 --> 09:51:28,810
All right.

15089
09:51:30,490 --> 09:51:32,030
I tried to stay positive.

15090
09:51:33,050 --> 09:51:34,970
No, we can't do this.

15091
09:51:36,750 --> 09:51:38,310
They'll be coming in 30 seconds.

15092
09:51:38,630 --> 09:51:39,230
Stay strong.

15093
09:51:39,790 --> 09:51:41,410
I'm like, who do I... What?

15094
09:51:41,490 --> 09:51:42,310
What's going on?

15095
09:51:42,770 --> 09:51:43,950
I got confused.

15096
09:51:44,210 --> 09:51:46,270
I got distracted with my own jingle jangle.

15097
09:51:54,730 --> 09:51:55,350
What's that?

15098
09:51:55,550 --> 09:51:56,450
Oh, I didn't even hear it.

15099
09:51:57,550 --> 09:51:58,470
I got distracted.

15100
09:51:58,470 --> 09:51:59,570
Every day people tell him that.

15101
09:51:59,670 --> 09:52:00,710
I'm like, jingle jangle.

15102
09:52:01,490 --> 09:52:02,490
Jingle jangle jangle.

15103
09:52:02,510 --> 09:52:03,410
I've never heard it before.

15104
09:52:04,490 --> 09:52:04,950
Where's that?

15105
09:52:05,190 --> 09:52:05,430
Hello.

15106
09:52:06,770 --> 09:52:07,770
All right, here we go.

15107
09:52:12,030 --> 09:52:12,730
Oh, damn.

15108
09:52:14,690 --> 09:52:15,570
Jesus Christ!

15109
09:52:15,570 --> 09:52:17,290
Oh my god.

15110
09:52:17,290 --> 09:52:22,190
If I wasn't healing, like, pre-healing him, he would actually be dead.

15111
09:52:22,670 --> 09:52:25,570
Literally, me pre-healing him saved this man's life.

15112
09:52:25,890 --> 09:52:27,010
That's actually crazy.

15113
09:52:28,130 --> 09:52:29,510
Oh my god.

15114
09:52:29,890 --> 09:52:30,430
Oh, what the fuck?

15115
09:52:34,800 --> 09:52:37,220
He took so much fucking damage.

15116
09:52:42,020 --> 09:52:42,460
Okay.

15117
09:52:43,280 --> 09:52:43,960
Oh my god.

15118
09:52:44,080 --> 09:52:44,100
Oh my god.

15119
09:52:44,100 --> 09:52:45,840
These guys are taking so much damage though.

15120
09:52:48,860 --> 09:52:49,460
Got it.

15121
09:52:49,800 --> 09:52:50,440
All right, nice.

15122
09:52:52,100 --> 09:52:52,520
Okay.

15123
09:52:53,500 --> 09:52:54,060
I'm healing.

15124
09:52:54,260 --> 09:52:54,920
I'm doing my job.

15125
09:52:54,920 --> 09:52:56,000
And I'm doing a little DPS.

15126
09:52:56,260 --> 09:52:56,600
Oh, oh.

15127
09:52:56,900 --> 09:52:57,520
Little mistake.

15128
09:52:57,840 --> 09:52:59,180
Mistake doing a little DPS.

15129
09:52:59,600 --> 09:53:00,180
Never again.

15130
09:53:00,180 --> 09:53:01,000
I'll never do that.

15131
09:53:02,700 --> 09:53:03,820
I can't believe it.

15132
09:53:03,880 --> 09:53:05,020
How could I heal?

15133
09:53:06,760 --> 09:53:08,420
Why the fuck would I do?

15134
09:53:08,580 --> 09:53:09,840
That's not my job.

15135
09:53:12,980 --> 09:53:13,960
Oh, I need it.

15136
09:53:14,460 --> 09:53:15,440
I need reload.

15137
09:53:15,660 --> 09:53:16,440
Please don't die.

15138
09:53:17,000 --> 09:53:18,080
Oh, by the way.

15139
09:53:18,280 --> 09:53:19,680
Maybe when I first started on that.

15140
09:53:20,140 --> 09:53:20,660
Oh, jeez.

15141
09:53:21,580 --> 09:53:23,020
Come back in, come back in, come back in.

15142
09:53:23,120 --> 09:53:26,080
There's so many things going on!

15143
09:53:26,920 --> 09:53:28,340
Everybody need it here!

15144
09:53:30,740 --> 09:53:31,780
Oh, no.

15145
09:53:32,620 --> 09:53:33,060
Where?

15146
09:53:34,160 --> 09:53:34,780
Where's that race?

15147
09:53:36,720 --> 09:53:37,760
All right.

15148
09:53:38,480 --> 09:53:38,820
Don't worry.

15149
09:53:38,880 --> 09:53:39,360
I dance.

15150
09:54:02,640 --> 09:54:03,480
That's unlucky.

15151
09:54:04,400 --> 09:54:06,280
I didn't even realize our hella died.

15152
09:54:08,520 --> 09:54:11,740
It's our little Rockefeller Street that was made for Eurovision.

15153
09:54:12,560 --> 09:54:14,560
Which I think is the funnest fact.

15154
09:54:14,960 --> 09:54:17,980
I know I keep mentioning this but I think it's silly.

15155
09:54:20,700 --> 09:54:27,040
That Rockefeller Street wasn't even made by an American.

15156
09:54:27,420 --> 09:54:29,820
It was made by a song for Eurovision.

15157
09:54:30,020 --> 09:54:33,380
And I don't even remember which it wasn't even... it was a European country.

15158
09:54:38,560 --> 09:54:40,900
Let's all fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

15159
09:54:43,260 --> 09:54:44,300
Jesus Christ.

15160
09:54:44,840 --> 09:54:45,620
Oh my God.

15161
09:54:46,920 --> 09:54:49,620
I am farming this as much as I can.

15162
09:54:55,520 --> 09:54:56,200
Oh my God.

15163
09:54:56,360 --> 09:54:57,180
No, I'm 90.

15164
09:54:57,720 --> 09:54:58,040
Please.

15165
09:54:58,640 --> 09:54:58,960
Please.

15166
09:54:59,300 --> 09:54:59,540
Oh my God.

15167
09:54:59,540 --> 09:54:59,660
No, I'm 90.

15168
09:55:00,600 --> 09:55:00,920
Please.

15169
09:55:00,960 --> 09:55:00,960
Please.

15170
09:55:01,360 --> 09:55:01,860
I'll TP.

15171
09:55:02,040 --> 09:55:02,260
I'll TP.

15172
09:55:02,620 --> 09:55:03,140
No, no, no.

15173
09:55:05,600 --> 09:55:06,240
Oh, okay.

15174
09:55:08,600 --> 09:55:09,400
Let me go first.

15175
09:55:09,520 --> 09:55:10,060
I'll go first.

15176
09:55:10,300 --> 09:55:10,680
I have TP.

15177
09:55:10,840 --> 09:55:11,120
I have TP.

15178
09:55:11,300 --> 09:55:11,460
We're good.

15179
09:55:11,580 --> 09:55:11,740
We're good.

15180
09:55:11,740 --> 09:55:12,640
Alright, nice.

15181
09:55:13,660 --> 09:55:14,360
Wreck it first.

15182
09:55:14,540 --> 09:55:14,880
Wreck it first.

15183
09:55:16,000 --> 09:55:17,240
Oh, our captain died.

15184
09:55:20,600 --> 09:55:22,500
He said he goes first, so I wait.

15185
09:55:23,020 --> 09:55:23,820
I just got one shot.

15186
09:55:24,600 --> 09:55:25,440
Then I can go.

15187
09:55:25,960 --> 09:55:27,420
Yeah, I was like, wait, he did.

15188
09:55:28,580 --> 09:55:29,300
Oh my God.

15189
09:55:29,420 --> 09:55:30,400
Please tell me there's a shit.

15190
09:55:30,600 --> 09:55:30,940
Please.

15191
09:55:31,160 --> 09:55:31,800
Oh my God.

15192
09:55:32,440 --> 09:55:32,980
I'm Nick.

15193
09:55:32,980 --> 09:55:33,140
Oh my God.

15194
09:55:33,140 --> 09:55:33,140
Hello.

15195
09:55:33,700 --> 09:55:34,100
I...

15196
09:55:39,480 --> 09:55:41,120
I was not expecting that.

15197
09:55:41,240 --> 09:55:41,520
You killed him?

15198
09:55:42,180 --> 09:55:42,260
Together.

15199
09:55:42,700 --> 09:55:43,500
To victory.

15200
09:55:43,740 --> 09:55:44,460
Mantis, Mantis.

15201
09:55:44,580 --> 09:55:45,040
We are undefeatable.

15202
09:55:45,240 --> 09:55:45,500
Mantis.

15203
09:55:45,500 --> 09:55:46,820
We are undefeatable.

15204
09:55:47,460 --> 09:55:48,300
Oh, goodbye.

15205
09:55:48,560 --> 09:55:49,040
Please stay alive.

15206
09:55:49,160 --> 09:55:49,620
Please stay alive.

15207
09:55:52,420 --> 09:55:53,580
I don't know who...

15208
09:55:53,580 --> 09:55:54,280
I want to help Drenco.

15209
09:55:54,580 --> 09:55:54,840
Hey, like.

15210
09:55:55,140 --> 09:55:55,500
I'm for you.

15211
09:55:56,920 --> 09:55:58,080
Oh my God.

15212
09:55:59,040 --> 09:56:00,480
That was a clutch.

15213
09:56:00,620 --> 09:56:00,740
Red.

15214
09:56:01,480 --> 09:56:02,320
Oh my God.

15215
09:56:02,420 --> 09:56:02,800
Oh my God.

15216
09:56:02,920 --> 09:56:02,960
Oh my God.

15217
09:56:07,640 --> 09:56:08,600
Please don't!

15218
09:56:10,580 --> 09:56:11,220
No.

15219
09:56:12,800 --> 09:56:15,760
No, we almost killed the Mantis.

15220
09:56:15,980 --> 09:56:17,480
Oh, he ran triple support.

15221
09:56:21,280 --> 09:56:23,100
There's so many ults.

15222
09:56:26,870 --> 09:56:31,030
I liked how he was like, you I ult first, Luna, and then he dies.

15223
09:56:31,490 --> 09:56:33,130
And he's like, nevermind, Luna.

15224
09:56:33,710 --> 09:56:34,010
You ult.

15225
09:56:34,010 --> 09:56:35,070
I went in through three ults.

15226
09:56:35,430 --> 09:56:35,870
Fun.

15227
09:56:38,600 --> 09:56:39,360
What country...

15228
09:56:39,360 --> 09:56:41,380
What country was it that made the...

15229
09:56:42,020 --> 09:56:43,460
Rockefeller song for Eurovision?

15230
09:56:50,740 --> 09:56:51,180
Okay.

15231
09:56:51,500 --> 09:56:51,880
That's five.

15232
09:56:53,780 --> 09:56:54,180
We're good.

15233
09:56:55,260 --> 09:56:55,940
We're okay.

15234
09:56:56,960 --> 09:56:58,360
Wait, where's my other tank?

15235
09:56:58,540 --> 09:56:59,240
Oh, there he is.

15236
09:56:59,380 --> 09:56:59,860
He's like...

15237
09:56:59,860 --> 09:57:01,180
A hundred miles away.

15238
09:57:01,920 --> 09:57:03,100
Jesus Christ, where is he going?

15239
09:57:03,540 --> 09:57:04,680
Oh, thank God, he's alive.

15240
09:57:04,680 --> 09:57:06,020
I have an amp if I can go first, Luna.

15241
09:57:08,600 --> 09:57:09,400
What did I get?

15242
09:57:09,400 --> 09:57:11,100
A nice deep freeze.

15243
09:57:11,100 --> 09:57:11,360
Alright.

15244
09:57:11,860 --> 09:57:12,620
Rockets first.

15245
09:57:13,480 --> 09:57:13,880
We're good.

15246
09:57:14,920 --> 09:57:15,920
Try to keep everybody up.

15247
09:57:16,200 --> 09:57:18,340
There's so many things going on, but don't worry.

15248
09:57:18,900 --> 09:57:20,160
Everyone will be okay.

15249
09:57:21,100 --> 09:57:23,660
I believe in the power of friendship.

15250
09:57:24,080 --> 09:57:24,600
That...

15251
09:57:24,600 --> 09:57:26,000
Okay, I don't know why we did that.

15252
09:57:26,200 --> 09:57:27,280
I still believe.

15253
09:57:30,140 --> 09:57:31,180
Oh, please.

15254
09:57:33,520 --> 09:57:34,220
I'm still alive.

15255
09:57:34,220 --> 09:57:34,740
It's fine.

15256
09:57:35,660 --> 09:57:36,620
I'm still alive.

15257
09:57:37,980 --> 09:57:38,760
Oh, fuck.

15258
09:57:38,880 --> 09:57:39,460
I don't see Star Lord.

15259
09:57:39,940 --> 09:57:41,240
We need to come, we need to come.

15260
09:57:43,980 --> 09:57:44,380
Alright.

15261
09:57:50,050 --> 09:57:52,730
Alright, so this is bad, because they do have...

15262
09:57:52,730 --> 09:57:53,950
Star Lord now.

15263
09:57:54,230 --> 09:57:56,470
We have Catborn and I will be back soon.

15264
09:57:56,850 --> 09:57:57,690
Alright, I'm dead.

15265
09:58:03,270 --> 09:58:04,810
Oh, was it Estonia?

15266
09:58:05,070 --> 09:58:05,770
That's funny.

15267
09:58:06,930 --> 09:58:08,370
Estonia made a rocket.

15268
09:58:08,570 --> 09:58:10,050
Yeah, that is such a good song though.

15269
09:58:10,630 --> 09:58:12,090
One, two, three, five...

15270
09:58:19,310 --> 09:58:19,950
Don't worry.

15271
09:58:20,990 --> 09:58:21,330
TGETE!

15272
09:58:27,690 --> 09:58:27,890
Red side?

15273
09:58:28,050 --> 09:58:28,550
Adam, right side.

15274
09:58:29,010 --> 09:58:31,010
I tried my best.

15275
09:58:32,630 --> 09:58:33,690
Resing, resing, red side.

15276
09:58:38,510 --> 09:58:38,950
Fine.

15277
09:58:42,750 --> 09:58:43,450
Last fight.

15278
09:58:44,630 --> 09:58:46,110
We killed... oh, never mind.

15279
09:58:50,030 --> 09:58:51,730
That's fine, there is an Emma.

15280
09:58:54,110 --> 09:58:54,550
God,

15281
09:58:59,050 --> 09:58:59,690
I was so scared!

15282
09:58:59,990 --> 09:59:00,750
I was so scared!

15283
09:59:02,730 --> 09:59:04,450
A nice, deep point.

15284
09:59:04,630 --> 09:59:06,030
That portal confused me.

15285
09:59:07,770 --> 09:59:09,650
I... got very confused.

15286
09:59:10,470 --> 09:59:11,030
I...

15287
09:59:11,730 --> 09:59:14,070
I was like, where did I go?

15288
09:59:14,310 --> 09:59:16,930
Zero, two, one.

15289
09:59:18,670 --> 09:59:20,470
Time to switch things up.

15290
09:59:20,610 --> 09:59:22,450
The thing is, I wasn't even kidnapped!

15291
09:59:22,850 --> 09:59:26,610
I willingly accidentally jumped into the portal.

15292
09:59:27,430 --> 09:59:29,110
I shine in darkness.

15293
09:59:29,330 --> 09:59:31,050
You need me to, like, PayPal use the battery?

15294
09:59:31,050 --> 09:59:31,330
Yeah.

15295
09:59:31,530 --> 09:59:31,970
Yeah.

15296
09:59:32,430 --> 09:59:32,870
Okay.

15297
09:59:33,910 --> 09:59:36,370
I could barely hear the smoke detector.

15298
09:59:38,230 --> 09:59:39,610
Yeah, I'm gonna type this, uh...

15299
09:59:39,610 --> 09:59:39,950
I'm gonna type this, uh...

15300
09:59:39,950 --> 09:59:40,530
I'm gonna type this, uh...

15301
09:59:40,530 --> 09:59:41,070
No, no, no.

15302
09:59:41,170 --> 09:59:41,610
No, no, no.

15303
09:59:41,610 --> 09:59:41,830
No, no, no.

15304
09:59:41,850 --> 09:59:43,050
Can I get some money as well?

15305
09:59:44,750 --> 09:59:45,130
Wow!

15306
09:59:45,710 --> 09:59:45,890
No, no.

15307
09:59:45,930 --> 09:59:46,710
Only this guy.

15308
09:59:47,030 --> 09:59:47,670
You need this money.

15309
09:59:47,810 --> 09:59:48,870
You'll pay...

15310
09:59:48,870 --> 09:59:49,750
Can you pay for my college tuition?

15311
09:59:50,350 --> 09:59:50,790
Him?

15312
09:59:51,110 --> 09:59:51,730
Just put all that...

15313
09:59:51,730 --> 09:59:52,950
But not me?

15314
09:59:53,330 --> 09:59:54,270
For fish?

15315
09:59:59,290 --> 10:00:03,270
But I'm on, like, martial scholarship, though.

15316
10:00:03,470 --> 10:00:04,450
Like, you don't gotta pay that much.

15317
10:00:04,690 --> 10:00:04,990
Only, like...

15318
10:00:04,990 --> 10:00:06,650
Wait, how much you get for a number one tournament?

15319
10:00:11,810 --> 10:00:12,630
He did it!

15320
10:00:13,150 --> 10:00:14,690
He had a drag...

15321
10:00:14,690 --> 10:00:15,830
A different dragon!

15322
10:00:16,570 --> 10:00:18,170
To pay for the fish!

15323
10:00:18,170 --> 10:00:19,850
Not the first time.

15324
10:00:19,850 --> 10:00:20,730
Yeah, that Boki, like, tried.

15325
10:00:20,850 --> 10:00:21,410
I'm not gonna lie.

15326
10:00:22,610 --> 10:00:23,050
Shame.

15327
10:00:23,650 --> 10:00:24,090
Shame!

15328
10:00:25,070 --> 10:00:25,510
Shame!

15329
10:00:25,510 --> 10:00:26,130
Shame him, guys!

15330
10:00:26,550 --> 10:00:27,250
Shame him!

15331
10:00:28,110 --> 10:00:28,910
I'm so mad.

15332
10:00:28,910 --> 10:00:30,090
Maybe I'll take away the fish.

15333
10:00:30,610 --> 10:00:31,470
Punish you all.

15334
10:00:32,750 --> 10:00:35,430
He's a dragoon, so all dragoons get punished.

15335
10:00:59,980 --> 10:01:02,480
He is one of you!

15336
10:01:07,880 --> 10:01:10,660
You shall all suffer for his crimes!

15337
10:01:11,040 --> 10:01:12,260
Oh, I didn't hear so.

15338
10:01:12,400 --> 10:01:12,420
You're a dude.

15339
10:01:16,060 --> 10:01:18,140
If we don't claim him.

15340
10:01:24,040 --> 10:01:25,800
Wait, he got kidnapped again?

15341
10:01:26,120 --> 10:01:26,300
What?

15342
10:01:28,900 --> 10:01:29,760
I got that.

15343
10:01:29,860 --> 10:01:30,140
I got that.

15344
10:01:30,220 --> 10:01:30,640
I got that for Bucky.

15345
10:01:31,680 --> 10:01:32,260
Near me low.

15346
10:01:32,260 --> 10:01:32,340
There we go.

15347
10:01:34,620 --> 10:01:35,180
What's that?

15348
10:01:38,400 --> 10:01:39,100
Nice deep breath.

15349
10:01:41,540 --> 10:01:42,960
I never have any less thump anymore.

15350
10:01:43,980 --> 10:01:44,900
Jesus Christ.

15351
10:01:47,680 --> 10:01:50,500
Okay, but can someone fix- Oh my god!

15352
10:01:54,020 --> 10:01:55,580
I was gonna go give it to them.

15353
10:01:56,080 --> 10:01:56,440
Oh fuck.

15354
10:01:56,680 --> 10:01:57,420
That was a duck stand.

15355
10:01:57,640 --> 10:01:57,780
I'm good.

15356
10:02:00,660 --> 10:02:01,120
No!

15357
10:02:01,680 --> 10:02:02,960
I froze him too!

15358
10:02:04,820 --> 10:02:08,170
I am ready to put on a show!

15359
10:02:08,430 --> 10:02:09,530
I am ready to put on a show!

15360
10:02:09,530 --> 10:02:09,590
Jesus Christ.

15361
10:02:09,590 --> 10:02:09,930
Jesus Christ.

15362
10:02:15,300 --> 10:02:16,800
Alright guys, let's do our thing!

15363
10:02:17,480 --> 10:02:18,260
I'm not back there.

15364
10:02:18,580 --> 10:02:20,460
They have another- They have another Luna- We have nothing.

15365
10:02:20,560 --> 10:02:25,340
Oh yeah, they have the- I- I- What- Oh my god!

15366
10:02:25,520 --> 10:02:28,120
There's a hell- How- Where was he?

15367
10:02:33,420 --> 10:02:35,580
I don't even hear the smoke alarm.

15368
10:02:36,560 --> 10:02:37,480
Is that bad?

15369
10:02:38,580 --> 10:02:39,100
Is that bad?

15370
10:02:39,320 --> 10:02:39,720
No!

15371
10:02:39,760 --> 10:02:39,940
Yo, Cap.

15372
10:02:40,080 --> 10:02:42,580
Don't you- Try and go for me and- Get out.

15373
10:02:43,440 --> 10:02:43,840
Get out.

15374
10:02:43,840 --> 10:02:44,180
Get out.

15375
10:02:45,780 --> 10:02:47,520
Uh, we'll bring the top looking for a pool.

15376
10:02:48,020 --> 10:02:48,300
Thank you.

15377
10:02:48,840 --> 10:02:50,520
I feel like to give it to Cap.

15378
10:02:55,390 --> 10:02:55,790
No.

15379
10:02:56,690 --> 10:02:57,590
I'm getting charged.

15380
10:02:57,690 --> 10:02:57,810
I'm getting charged.

15381
10:02:57,810 --> 10:02:58,190
It's still blatant.

15382
10:02:58,310 --> 10:02:59,050
This shit isn't insane.

15383
10:02:59,570 --> 10:02:59,990
You're welcome!

15384
10:03:00,450 --> 10:03:00,950
Face down!

15385
10:03:03,090 --> 10:03:03,990
I'm just getting charged.

15386
10:03:04,130 --> 10:03:04,550
It's still blatant.

15387
10:03:05,130 --> 10:03:05,610
I'm just getting charged.

15388
10:03:05,610 --> 10:03:06,810
It's still blatant.

15389
10:03:08,350 --> 10:03:08,830
Alright.

15390
10:03:09,030 --> 10:03:09,950
Alright, I'm okay man.

15391
10:03:09,970 --> 10:03:11,530
The double- Jesus.

15392
10:03:13,130 --> 10:03:14,310
I killed one.

15393
10:03:14,630 --> 10:03:14,810
Fine.

15394
10:03:15,150 --> 10:03:15,470
Good job.

15395
10:03:16,490 --> 10:03:17,530
Oh my god.

15396
10:03:17,670 --> 10:03:18,210
That- Oh!

15397
10:03:22,050 --> 10:03:22,510
Alright.

15398
10:03:22,830 --> 10:03:23,590
Oh my god.

15399
10:03:23,770 --> 10:03:25,510
He still killed some- Hello?

15400
10:03:26,170 --> 10:03:28,190
He still killed somebody at the end.

15401
10:03:35,220 --> 10:03:36,760
This is uh- This is great.

15402
10:03:38,220 --> 10:03:38,680
Um...

15403
10:03:38,680 --> 10:03:39,520
Only 60 seconds left.

15404
10:03:39,520 --> 10:03:44,640
Yeah, I don't think our Hellya is- I'm not gonna- Like, you're like- I was right.

15405
10:03:44,820 --> 10:03:48,440
It worked on defense to stall, but it's not gonna work on fucking- It's active.

15406
10:03:48,600 --> 10:03:49,460
Oh, I hear it.

15407
10:03:51,660 --> 10:03:52,640
Guys, I hear it.

15408
10:03:52,700 --> 10:03:53,060
I hear it.

15409
10:03:53,100 --> 10:03:53,360
Don't worry.

15410
10:03:53,460 --> 10:03:53,980
I hear it now.

15411
10:03:58,260 --> 10:03:59,360
I hear it now.

15412
10:03:59,660 --> 10:04:00,220
Don't worry.

15413
10:04:04,320 --> 10:04:05,320
I hear it guys.

15414
10:04:05,620 --> 10:04:05,840
Yep.

15415
10:04:11,160 --> 10:04:11,960
Jesus Christ.

15416
10:04:14,300 --> 10:04:15,580
I think our comp is just bad.

15417
10:04:16,600 --> 10:04:17,000
Honestly.

15418
10:04:19,820 --> 10:04:22,600
The cop is bad for- Oh no!

15419
10:04:23,160 --> 10:04:23,680
For attack.

15420
10:04:23,820 --> 10:04:24,780
I'm trying to triple tank for that.

15421
10:04:25,960 --> 10:04:26,420
For this.

15422
10:04:28,360 --> 10:04:29,660
I don't give a fuck.

15423
10:04:38,000 --> 10:04:39,260
I don't need it yet.

15424
10:04:39,900 --> 10:04:41,280
Okay, I need to use it now.

15425
10:04:44,720 --> 10:04:45,560
What?

15426
10:04:45,560 --> 10:04:47,880
He's so mean- He's so mean- He's so mean- I blocked it.

15427
10:04:48,300 --> 10:04:48,580
What?

15428
10:04:53,140 --> 10:04:53,980
Magneto!

15429
10:04:54,880 --> 10:04:55,180
No!

15430
10:04:57,220 --> 10:05:00,680
He wants- Oh my god!

15431
10:05:01,200 --> 10:05:03,640
He moved to the left!

15432
10:05:04,440 --> 10:05:05,500
A nice deep- No!

15433
10:05:05,920 --> 10:05:06,740
That sucks.

15434
10:05:10,700 --> 10:05:12,040
That sucks.

15435
10:05:13,000 --> 10:05:15,040
He moved to the left!

15436
10:05:15,300 --> 10:05:15,480
Oh!

15437
10:05:15,760 --> 10:05:16,760
He moved away!

15438
10:05:19,260 --> 10:05:20,860
He moved away!

15439
10:05:21,880 --> 10:05:23,700
He moved away!

15440
10:05:24,660 --> 10:05:25,500
He moved away!

15441
10:05:27,500 --> 10:05:28,500
I'm okay.

15442
10:05:28,900 --> 10:05:30,460
I just love Marvel Rivals.

15443
10:05:30,460 --> 10:05:31,420
I expect you to the remote.

15444
10:05:31,840 --> 10:05:33,000
I'm yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.

15445
10:05:33,600 --> 10:05:35,800
Marvel Rivals is just like this fish.

15446
10:05:36,760 --> 10:05:37,640
I'm going...

15447
10:05:37,640 --> 10:05:39,920
Um yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.

15448
10:05:40,140 --> 10:05:41,480
Is that Marvel Rivals I see?

15449
10:05:41,640 --> 10:05:42,500
Um yum yum yum yum.

15450
10:05:51,340 --> 10:05:58,100
I'm just streaming my... I'm just streaming my guilty pleasure.

15451
10:05:59,580 --> 10:06:01,780
You see, this is what I was like.

15452
10:06:02,460 --> 10:06:06,260
I'll just let you know... I'll

15453
10:06:11,180 --> 10:06:16,340
just let you guys know... that I was a lot worse when it came to Apex and Overwatch.

15454
10:06:16,340 --> 10:06:20,020
But, like, I didn't stream it.

15455
10:06:23,660 --> 10:06:26,860
Now, I'm more willing to stream it.

15456
10:06:27,480 --> 10:06:30,660
My degeneracy was much, much, much worse.

15457
10:06:32,940 --> 10:06:36,240
It was a lot worse than what it was now.

15458
10:06:38,360 --> 10:06:46,320
For those who weren't there, I told the Dragoons that back then, I would literally stop streaming for a month.

15459
10:06:46,340 --> 10:06:48,260
Just because I want to play Apex.

15460
10:06:53,480 --> 10:06:54,900
Seijin, thank you for the super chat.

15461
10:06:55,020 --> 10:06:55,220
Thank you.

15462
10:06:55,340 --> 10:06:55,820
Thank you.

15463
10:06:56,280 --> 10:06:57,760
That was how bad it was.

15464
10:06:58,300 --> 10:07:01,480
I literally... even in Overwatch, I would literally go months without streaming.

15465
10:07:01,920 --> 10:07:03,020
And I'd just come back.

15466
10:07:03,180 --> 10:07:04,080
And I'll stream again.

15467
10:07:04,560 --> 10:07:06,440
And then I'll, like, disappear again.

15468
10:07:06,900 --> 10:07:08,900
And then... and I'll disappear again.

15469
10:07:09,180 --> 10:07:12,360
And then, like, because I'd be like, I want to play more Apex rank.

15470
10:07:12,520 --> 10:07:14,140
Or I want to play more Overwatch rank.

15471
10:07:14,300 --> 10:07:15,580
And I'll disappear again.

15472
10:07:15,960 --> 10:07:17,080
And then...

15473
10:07:17,520 --> 10:07:17,900
Um...

15474
10:07:17,900 --> 10:07:19,540
And then, like, I just show back up.

15475
10:07:21,380 --> 10:07:22,280
But now I'm better.

15476
10:07:22,680 --> 10:07:23,680
I don't disappear.

15477
10:07:23,900 --> 10:07:24,260
I don't disappear this time.

15478
10:07:24,680 --> 10:07:26,600
Instead, you get to see my degeneracy.

15479
10:07:30,060 --> 10:07:33,620
I'll just start cheering and act as if I wasn't gone for, like, six months.

15480
10:07:37,160 --> 10:07:40,580
It wasn't gone for, uh...

15481
10:07:42,080 --> 10:07:43,660
Six months of Apex rank.

15482
10:07:45,820 --> 10:07:46,860
So, like...

15483
10:07:46,860 --> 10:07:47,800
Now you have this.

15484
10:07:53,700 --> 10:07:54,960
How many did I lose?

15485
10:07:55,200 --> 10:07:56,020
I was at 99.

15486
10:07:57,340 --> 10:07:58,360
Now I'm at 80.

15487
10:07:58,620 --> 10:08:00,640
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

15488
10:08:01,900 --> 10:08:03,300
How much did I lose there?

15489
10:08:04,180 --> 10:08:05,100
I'm Luna Snow.

15490
10:08:05,100 --> 10:08:05,280
Now...

15491
10:08:05,280 --> 10:08:07,100
Like the moon...

15492
10:08:07,100 --> 10:08:07,700
I shine...

15493
10:08:07,700 --> 10:08:09,080
Wait, is that...

15494
10:08:09,860 --> 10:08:10,980
Oh, is that Choppa?

15495
10:08:14,060 --> 10:08:14,700
Now...

15496
10:08:14,700 --> 10:08:17,040
Who am I gonna vanish from this match?

15497
10:08:24,920 --> 10:08:27,280
Is this yellow TTK?

15498
10:08:33,400 --> 10:08:34,720
Well, it's 1am.

15499
10:08:34,960 --> 10:08:35,700
Good night, Doki.

15500
10:08:35,900 --> 10:08:37,780
Good night, Abaddon.

15501
10:08:37,780 --> 10:08:38,760
Thank you for the super chat.

15502
10:08:38,880 --> 10:08:39,080
Thank you.

15503
10:08:39,240 --> 10:08:39,740
Thank you.

15504
10:08:41,520 --> 10:08:43,100
Who else would be yellow TTK?

15505
10:08:44,900 --> 10:08:46,380
Wouldn't it be funny if it was TTK?

15506
10:08:46,480 --> 10:08:47,060
Oh, it wasn't.

15507
10:08:47,440 --> 10:08:48,500
I'd be like...

15508
10:08:48,500 --> 10:08:51,700
Wouldn't it be funny if it was TTK that named themselves yellow TTK?

15509
10:09:05,640 --> 10:09:05,960
Huh?

15510
10:09:05,960 --> 10:09:06,040
Huh?

15511
10:09:10,840 --> 10:09:13,680
I only know Choppa that calls himself that.

15512
10:09:14,080 --> 10:09:15,720
Choppa's the only guy I know...

15513
10:09:15,720 --> 10:09:17,820
The only player I know that calls himself...

15514
10:09:17,820 --> 10:09:18,640
Yellow TTK.

15515
10:09:28,070 --> 10:09:29,610
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum.

15516
10:09:41,340 --> 10:09:41,860
Interesting.

15517
10:09:43,040 --> 10:09:43,560
True.

15518
10:09:44,780 --> 10:09:45,380
Hahaha.

15519
10:09:50,140 --> 10:09:50,540
Hahaha.

15520
10:09:52,220 --> 10:09:55,660
It's easier being a superhero when you have the fame part to get out.

15521
10:09:57,620 --> 10:09:58,640
This is a nice...

15522
10:09:58,640 --> 10:10:00,120
Thirty seconds before you attack.

15523
10:10:00,480 --> 10:10:01,040
Get ready.

15524
10:10:04,370 --> 10:10:06,090
You're a famous pop star, right?

15525
10:10:06,450 --> 10:10:06,730
Ugh.

15526
10:10:07,210 --> 10:10:08,230
That is so cool.

15527
10:10:10,690 --> 10:10:12,470
Wait, is that not Choppa?

15528
10:10:15,950 --> 10:10:18,210
Wait, is that not Choppa?

15529
10:10:18,750 --> 10:10:20,510
I'm so confused.

15530
10:10:22,050 --> 10:10:23,930
Is someone else...

15531
10:10:23,930 --> 10:10:25,250
Is someone else...

15532
10:10:25,250 --> 10:10:26,330
Yellow TTK?

15533
10:10:32,010 --> 10:10:33,970
Oh, shut the fuck up.

15534
10:10:33,970 --> 10:10:34,490
Hahaha.

15535
10:10:36,070 --> 10:10:37,510
No, it is Choppa.

15536
10:10:37,530 --> 10:10:37,910
I got him.

15537
10:10:38,050 --> 10:10:38,990
It is Choppa.

15538
10:10:39,670 --> 10:10:41,070
It is Choppa.

15539
10:10:41,410 --> 10:10:41,890
Hahaha.

15540
10:10:42,550 --> 10:10:44,650
He doesn't like it when we tell him...

15541
10:10:44,650 --> 10:10:46,470
That Fun Fun's better.

15542
10:10:48,750 --> 10:10:50,050
No, yeah, no, that's him.

15543
10:11:01,320 --> 10:11:01,800
Oh,

15544
10:11:06,520 --> 10:11:07,000
I remember I'm...

15545
10:11:10,990 --> 10:11:13,470
I need to remember that I am...

15546
10:11:14,770 --> 10:11:15,650
Jesus Christ.

15547
10:11:15,830 --> 10:11:16,550
There's too many...

15548
10:11:16,930 --> 10:11:19,510
My team is all over the place, so it's very hard right now.

15549
10:11:22,970 --> 10:11:23,690
That's unlucky.

15550
10:11:23,970 --> 10:11:25,050
My team is all over the place.

15551
10:11:25,190 --> 10:11:26,130
I can't...

15552
10:11:28,090 --> 10:11:28,870
Oh my god.

15553
10:11:29,730 --> 10:11:30,950
I'm just gonna die here.

15554
10:11:32,050 --> 10:11:32,490
Uh...

15555
10:11:32,490 --> 10:11:34,070
I don't wanna play Luna against that.

15556
10:11:36,670 --> 10:11:37,110
Actually...

15557
10:11:38,090 --> 10:11:38,650
Uh...

15558
10:11:38,650 --> 10:11:39,650
I don't know.

15559
10:11:39,950 --> 10:11:42,050
I don't wanna play Luna against...

15560
10:11:42,050 --> 10:11:43,530
What I just had to play.

15561
10:11:44,110 --> 10:11:44,970
It was so...

15562
10:11:44,970 --> 10:11:46,370
It was so hard.

15563
10:11:47,230 --> 10:11:48,150
To like, focus.

15564
10:11:53,840 --> 10:11:55,740
Yeah, I have rough time focusing there.

15565
10:12:06,710 --> 10:12:07,750
I got focus.

15566
10:12:08,510 --> 10:12:08,870
Whoa!

15567
10:12:09,290 --> 10:12:10,950
I hate that like...

15568
10:12:10,950 --> 10:12:11,590
For dive?

15569
10:12:11,590 --> 10:12:12,610
I literally...

15570
10:12:13,130 --> 10:12:13,990
I can't...

15571
10:12:13,990 --> 10:12:14,230
I...

15572
10:12:14,230 --> 10:12:15,510
It's so hard to talk.

15573
10:12:16,010 --> 10:12:16,870
Against dive.

15574
10:12:17,230 --> 10:12:19,430
Against dive, I have to use like...

15575
10:12:19,430 --> 10:12:20,250
My entire brain.

15576
10:12:20,570 --> 10:12:21,510
To like...

15577
10:12:21,510 --> 10:12:22,950
Fucking figure out what's going on.

15578
10:12:23,250 --> 10:12:23,830
It's actually...

15579
10:12:24,430 --> 10:12:24,710
Oh my...

15580
10:12:24,710 --> 10:12:25,810
This is why I don't like streaming.

15581
10:12:26,710 --> 10:12:27,270
Like...

15582
10:12:27,270 --> 10:12:28,270
Not like, but...

15583
10:12:28,270 --> 10:12:30,330
This is why I haven't streamed Marvel Rivals in a long time.

15584
10:12:31,810 --> 10:12:33,910
Like, it's just so hard to...

15585
10:12:33,910 --> 10:12:34,890
Multi-pass this.

15586
10:12:43,720 --> 10:12:44,360
Okay.

15587
10:12:44,700 --> 10:12:44,840
Nice.

15588
10:12:45,020 --> 10:12:45,360
We're fine.

15589
10:12:45,580 --> 10:12:45,820
We're fine.

15590
10:12:45,960 --> 10:12:46,760
Everybody's okay.

15591
10:12:48,540 --> 10:12:50,600
Everybody is okay, I think.

15592
10:12:52,120 --> 10:12:53,160
He's assembling.

15593
10:12:56,900 --> 10:12:57,920
He's assembling.

15594
10:12:59,140 --> 10:13:00,160
Oh, I...

15595
10:13:00,160 --> 10:13:01,760
Didn't see how low people were.

15596
10:13:01,900 --> 10:13:03,120
That was my bad, actually.

15597
10:13:04,800 --> 10:13:05,440
I...

15598
10:13:06,140 --> 10:13:07,040
Oh, no.

15599
10:13:07,920 --> 10:13:08,740
No way!

15600
10:13:17,780 --> 10:13:19,000
He didn't even...

15601
10:13:19,000 --> 10:13:19,040
He didn't even...

15602
10:13:19,040 --> 10:13:19,560
Do shield!

15603
10:13:23,160 --> 10:13:25,580
No, it's just harder to focus...

15604
10:13:25,580 --> 10:13:26,400
When die...

15605
10:13:26,400 --> 10:13:26,840
Like...

15606
10:13:26,840 --> 10:13:27,840
Multi-task and dive.

15607
10:13:29,660 --> 10:13:30,700
Because like...

15608
10:13:30,700 --> 10:13:31,160
Everybody...

15609
10:13:31,160 --> 10:13:31,520
Oh my god.

15610
10:13:31,640 --> 10:13:32,840
Everybody is everywhere too.

15611
10:13:33,920 --> 10:13:34,340
Like...

15612
10:13:34,340 --> 10:13:35,540
This is so hard to heal.

15613
10:13:35,880 --> 10:13:37,580
I might actually have to go Luna...

15614
10:13:38,080 --> 10:13:38,340
too.

15615
10:13:38,840 --> 10:13:39,780
It's actually...

15616
10:13:39,780 --> 10:13:41,260
Really hard to heal this team.

15617
10:13:47,600 --> 10:13:48,560
Okay.

15618
10:13:48,560 --> 10:13:48,680
Okay.

15619
10:13:51,960 --> 10:13:52,920
Alright.

15620
10:13:54,720 --> 10:13:55,220
Bad.

15621
10:14:00,690 --> 10:14:02,310
I didn't get a chance to give...

15622
10:14:02,310 --> 10:14:04,510
Orb to...

15623
10:14:08,170 --> 10:14:08,930
Don't worry!

15624
10:14:10,270 --> 10:14:11,650
Oh my god!

15625
10:14:11,790 --> 10:14:12,130
Worry!

15626
10:14:12,470 --> 10:14:13,190
Worry!

15627
10:14:14,390 --> 10:14:15,350
Worry!

15628
10:14:16,410 --> 10:14:17,570
Start worrying!

15629
10:14:17,910 --> 10:14:18,490
Because I...

15630
10:14:18,490 --> 10:14:19,510
Don't have ult yet!

15631
10:14:20,290 --> 10:14:21,350
Are you fucking...

15632
10:14:22,010 --> 10:14:22,650
Kidding me?

15633
10:14:27,090 --> 10:14:28,370
Jesus Christ.

15634
10:14:31,970 --> 10:14:33,030
I have to reload.

15635
10:14:33,630 --> 10:14:35,770
I have to use my C so...

15636
10:14:35,770 --> 10:14:37,530
My team can live a little longer.

15637
10:14:40,470 --> 10:14:41,070
Here.

15638
10:14:41,070 --> 10:14:42,910
He already has another ult!

15639
10:14:43,070 --> 10:14:43,590
That's crazy.

15640
10:14:45,950 --> 10:14:47,890
Our rocket already got another ult during that.

15641
10:14:50,910 --> 10:14:52,110
Oh my god.

15642
10:14:52,910 --> 10:14:53,450
I don't...

15643
10:14:53,450 --> 10:14:55,710
Our rocket built two ults in that fight.

15644
10:14:56,250 --> 10:14:57,310
That's actually crazy.

15645
10:14:57,690 --> 10:14:59,790
I am struggling so hard right now.

15646
10:15:03,240 --> 10:15:06,220
The fact that our rocket built two ults during that...

15647
10:15:06,220 --> 10:15:06,580
That...

15648
10:15:06,580 --> 10:15:07,480
This rocket's really good.

15649
10:15:10,560 --> 10:15:13,220
Like, it's actually really, really crazy that he built two.

15650
10:15:14,300 --> 10:15:15,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15651
10:15:15,300 --> 10:15:16,180
Hold up, team!

15652
10:15:18,580 --> 10:15:19,320
A nice deep breath!

15653
10:15:19,320 --> 10:15:19,720
A nice deep breath!

15654
10:15:24,770 --> 10:15:25,370
Oh my god.

15655
10:15:26,290 --> 10:15:26,810
Assemble!

15656
10:15:29,600 --> 10:15:30,600
I am ready to go to show!

15657
10:15:30,600 --> 10:15:31,260
I am ready to go to show!

15658
10:15:31,340 --> 10:15:32,340
I am ready to go to show!

15659
10:15:35,740 --> 10:15:36,260
Please!

15660
10:15:39,060 --> 10:15:40,040
Please!

15661
10:15:41,760 --> 10:15:43,000
Please lift!

15662
10:15:45,240 --> 10:15:46,020
Nice.

15663
10:15:46,340 --> 10:15:46,700
Yay!

15664
10:15:47,100 --> 10:15:47,340
They lived!

15665
10:15:51,050 --> 10:15:51,830
Yay!

15666
10:15:54,050 --> 10:15:55,390
They lived!

15667
10:15:56,930 --> 10:15:59,490
I mean, I had to compliment him.

15668
10:15:59,850 --> 10:16:00,870
I literally start...

15669
10:16:00,870 --> 10:16:03,010
We started the fight with a rocket on...

15670
10:16:03,010 --> 10:16:06,630
And then he built another rocket ult during that fight.

15671
10:16:07,110 --> 10:16:08,150
That was crazy.

15672
10:16:11,350 --> 10:16:12,730
He has zero defs too.

15673
10:16:14,770 --> 10:16:16,330
Like, I didn't even get my ult yet.

15674
10:16:16,470 --> 10:16:17,050
That's the thing.

15675
10:16:18,350 --> 10:16:19,690
He did all of that?

15676
10:16:19,930 --> 10:16:21,470
And I still didn't have my ult.

15677
10:16:22,890 --> 10:16:24,890
I was still trying to build my own ult.

15678
10:16:29,090 --> 10:16:30,630
I'm sorry, I lied.

15679
10:16:32,810 --> 10:16:33,750
Oh my god.

15680
10:16:33,750 --> 10:16:35,770
You are such a huge star to the Badoo.

15681
10:16:35,810 --> 10:16:37,030
I don't know if that's actually...

15682
10:16:37,030 --> 10:16:37,570
Oh.

15683
10:16:37,570 --> 10:16:37,890
Amazing.

15684
10:16:38,830 --> 10:16:39,050
Amazing.

15685
10:16:39,050 --> 10:16:40,830
I didn't think the aliens listened to K-pop.

15686
10:16:41,550 --> 10:16:41,610
Oh.

15687
10:16:41,890 --> 10:16:42,690
For sure.

15688
10:16:43,270 --> 10:16:43,410
Yeah.

15689
10:16:43,530 --> 10:16:47,230
Rocket said that we could sell sign pics of you for like a fortune on Lotiara.

15690
10:16:47,730 --> 10:16:48,390
I love...

15691
10:16:48,390 --> 10:16:49,130
Rivals.

15692
10:16:49,890 --> 10:16:51,510
Is that Rivals I see?

15693
10:16:53,530 --> 10:16:55,730
That Don King gets better.

15694
10:16:59,710 --> 10:17:00,910
That's right.

15695
10:17:01,750 --> 10:17:02,790
That's me!

15696
10:17:06,090 --> 10:17:07,150
That's me!

15697
10:17:07,630 --> 10:17:08,450
That's me!

15698
10:17:10,150 --> 10:17:12,410
Oh my god, I know that person.

15699
10:17:14,150 --> 10:17:15,230
I know them.

15700
10:17:16,230 --> 10:17:17,270
Wait, what the fuck?

15701
10:17:18,370 --> 10:17:19,430
What is he doing here?

15702
10:17:23,930 --> 10:17:24,590
Oh, wait.

15703
10:17:29,860 --> 10:17:30,300
No!

15704
10:17:32,510 --> 10:17:33,530
Oh my god, I'm so dumb.

15705
10:17:33,850 --> 10:17:35,170
I didn't know where the hell I was.

15706
10:17:36,610 --> 10:17:38,690
I actually did not know where the hell I was.

15707
10:17:38,790 --> 10:17:39,750
I got so confused.

15708
10:17:41,250 --> 10:17:43,690
I heard, you belong to me.

15709
10:17:43,690 --> 10:17:45,190
And I was like, where?

15710
10:17:47,510 --> 10:17:48,770
Along where?

15711
10:17:50,910 --> 10:17:51,710
Huh?

15712
10:17:53,790 --> 10:17:55,370
What does that mean?

15713
10:18:04,060 --> 10:18:07,260
She was literally... What do you mean?

15714
10:18:09,480 --> 10:18:11,600
Is she talking about me?

15715
10:18:15,960 --> 10:18:19,420
Is she... Is she talking about me?

15716
10:18:19,680 --> 10:18:21,400
Am I the...

15717
10:18:23,260 --> 10:18:25,420
Oh my god, a gulp?

15718
10:18:25,600 --> 10:18:26,360
I'm blushing.

15719
10:18:27,300 --> 10:18:30,380
Oh my god, I belong to her, guys.

15720
10:18:31,420 --> 10:18:32,140
Oh, me.

15721
10:18:32,140 --> 10:18:44,420
Oh my god.

15722
10:18:48,720 --> 10:18:49,840
I got so embarrassed!

15723
10:18:51,020 --> 10:18:51,340
Wow!

15724
10:18:51,340 --> 10:18:51,680
Oh!

15725
10:18:52,800 --> 10:18:54,300
Hey, rip boi!

15726
10:18:56,160 --> 10:18:57,540
Oh wait, he's back!

15727
10:19:01,120 --> 10:19:01,720
Okay.

15728
10:19:16,850 --> 10:19:18,550
Oh my god!

15729
10:19:18,790 --> 10:19:19,230
No, please!

15730
10:19:19,630 --> 10:19:20,410
Please, go!

15731
10:19:28,400 --> 10:19:29,200
Don't worry.

15732
10:19:29,840 --> 10:19:30,640
I got you.

15733
10:19:31,220 --> 10:19:34,580
Oh wait, um... Wait, he never misses though.

15734
10:19:36,800 --> 10:19:38,420
He never misses though.

15735
10:19:39,140 --> 10:19:40,040
He'll be fine.

15736
10:19:43,800 --> 10:19:44,800
I believe.

15737
10:19:45,420 --> 10:19:46,060
Whoa!

15738
10:19:48,820 --> 10:19:49,880
Go in there!

15739
10:19:51,120 --> 10:19:52,280
Go in there!

15740
10:19:52,900 --> 10:19:53,920
I believe!

15741
10:19:54,840 --> 10:19:57,360
I'm so... I'm just a shy little guy.

15742
10:19:58,340 --> 10:19:59,020
Nice.

15743
10:19:59,180 --> 10:20:00,280
I got the last kill too.

15744
10:20:04,500 --> 10:20:04,920
Yay!

15745
10:20:06,280 --> 10:20:06,880
Did I get it?

15746
10:20:06,980 --> 10:20:08,120
Did I get Celestia too?

15747
10:20:11,520 --> 10:20:12,560
I just need 20.

15748
10:20:14,540 --> 10:20:16,540
But knowing me, I'm gonna get plus 19.

15749
10:20:21,340 --> 10:20:22,840
I think I didn't get the most healing.

15750
10:20:23,760 --> 10:20:25,180
I didn't get any of the stats.

15751
10:20:27,060 --> 10:20:29,180
Ah, I don't think I got plus 20.

15752
10:20:30,920 --> 10:20:31,960
No, I did!

15753
10:20:33,180 --> 10:20:33,600
Yay!

15754
10:20:37,420 --> 10:20:39,200
Oh wait, this guy was throwing.

15755
10:20:40,200 --> 10:20:42,320
How do you have 7 point... Wait, what?

15756
10:20:44,280 --> 10:20:45,500
You're so great.

15757
10:20:45,680 --> 10:20:46,700
Great job, Rocket.

15758
10:20:49,100 --> 10:20:50,960
Captain Korea retired.

15759
10:20:51,380 --> 10:20:51,980
GG.

15760
10:20:55,720 --> 10:20:56,820
I'll miss...

15761
10:20:56,820 --> 10:20:57,100
I'll miss...

15762
10:20:57,100 --> 10:20:58,880
Captain Korea.

15763
10:21:06,110 --> 10:21:06,750
Meep!

15764
10:21:06,830 --> 10:21:07,930
Thank you for the Magenta Super!

15765
10:21:08,430 --> 10:21:09,490
Thank you, thank you!

15766
10:21:10,870 --> 10:21:11,890
Lurker Meep!

15767
10:21:12,050 --> 10:21:13,490
Lurker Meep has exceeded operating hours.

15768
10:21:13,750 --> 10:21:14,470
Good night, goons!

15769
10:21:14,690 --> 10:21:16,190
And Doki Curse of Rod!

15770
10:21:16,410 --> 10:21:17,090
Nooo!

15771
10:21:19,570 --> 10:21:21,370
You took my drinks!

15772
10:21:21,910 --> 10:21:23,430
Is that not enough?

15773
10:21:24,050 --> 10:21:26,010
You took my drink!

15774
10:21:26,790 --> 10:21:29,270
I didn't get my mango!

15775
10:21:36,510 --> 10:21:37,710
I didn't get my mango!

15776
10:21:40,990 --> 10:21:43,210
Fun fun would have been...

15777
10:21:43,210 --> 10:21:43,310
Oh!

15778
10:21:43,690 --> 10:21:43,810
Oh!

15779
10:21:44,030 --> 10:21:44,650
I forgot!

15780
10:21:44,990 --> 10:21:47,090
I forgot, like, I still have it bounded.

15781
10:21:47,690 --> 10:21:48,350
Give me a sec.

15782
10:21:51,170 --> 10:21:52,650
I tried to turn it off.

15783
10:21:54,050 --> 10:21:54,550
There you go.

15784
10:21:56,050 --> 10:21:56,970
Don't worry, I got you.

15785
10:21:58,630 --> 10:21:59,490
All right, here you go.

15786
10:22:01,170 --> 10:22:01,550
No!

15787
10:22:02,810 --> 10:22:04,770
I require more fish!

15788
10:22:04,770 --> 10:22:35,270
Um-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum- We're queued up.

15789
10:22:38,920 --> 10:22:39,980
We're queued.

15790
10:22:42,440 --> 10:22:43,640
Oh, there's queued.

15791
10:22:50,410 --> 10:22:51,590
Chella's still there?

15792
10:22:51,790 --> 10:22:52,930
No, it should be there.

15793
10:22:53,010 --> 10:22:53,930
It's my jingle jangle.

15794
10:22:54,170 --> 10:22:55,250
Jingle jangle jangle.

15795
10:22:55,270 --> 10:22:56,110
Pay attention, chat.

15796
10:22:56,430 --> 10:22:57,570
Pay attention arrivals.

15797
10:22:57,970 --> 10:22:58,950
Jingle jangle jangle.

15798
10:23:02,010 --> 10:23:03,110
Pay attention.

15799
10:23:03,810 --> 10:23:04,610
Jingle jangle.

15800
10:23:07,890 --> 10:23:09,470
No, I wasn't earlier.

15801
10:23:10,010 --> 10:23:11,770
I was queued up earlier.

15802
10:23:29,650 --> 10:23:31,230
Yeah, I'm Celestia too.

15803
10:23:32,570 --> 10:23:33,830
We're almost there.

15804
10:23:36,370 --> 10:23:38,350
Let's try DPS a little bit.

15805
10:23:39,090 --> 10:23:39,650
Whoops.

15806
10:23:41,130 --> 10:23:43,050
I think he was actually roleplaying.

15807
10:23:43,750 --> 10:23:45,750
Oh my god, are these roleplayers again?

15808
10:23:46,110 --> 10:23:46,330
Whoops.

15809
10:23:47,070 --> 10:23:48,250
I wanted to get that.

15810
10:23:49,750 --> 10:23:50,690
Where am I?

15811
10:23:56,210 --> 10:23:56,730
Oh.

15812
10:23:57,830 --> 10:24:00,430
Oh my god, I haven't played D... It's been so long.

15813
10:24:00,870 --> 10:24:01,830
Oh my god!

15814
10:24:02,270 --> 10:24:04,170
Oh my god, that's so...

15815
10:24:04,170 --> 10:24:07,950
Oh my god, I've been playing not DPS for so long.

15816
10:24:08,050 --> 10:24:09,310
I forgot how to play DPS.

15817
10:24:10,590 --> 10:24:11,950
I was like, whoops.

15818
10:24:13,270 --> 10:24:14,310
Missed a shot.

15819
10:24:22,740 --> 10:24:23,260
Oh!

15820
10:24:26,860 --> 10:24:30,380
Alright, good night, the dragoons that have survived 10 hours.

15821
10:24:30,760 --> 10:24:31,780
You are very strong.

15822
10:24:41,740 --> 10:24:43,180
You're so strong.

15823
10:24:46,300 --> 10:24:47,260
Out-aured.

15824
10:24:47,780 --> 10:24:50,440
Like, gulp?

15825
10:24:59,760 --> 10:25:03,440
No, Flo, I'm telling you, the strat... oh, shit, they did it.

15826
10:25:03,820 --> 10:25:07,280
The strat is a ban towards Psylocke, the games go so easy.

15827
10:25:09,480 --> 10:25:10,980
Should we balance Psylocke?

15828
10:25:11,740 --> 10:25:14,360
The games get so easy, trust me.

15829
10:25:14,840 --> 10:25:17,860
Alright, not for me, because I'm a support.

15830
10:25:24,240 --> 10:25:25,240
Not for me.

15831
10:25:27,560 --> 10:25:30,960
Watch, now they're gonna ban Groot, and then it's a three-way ban, watch.

15832
10:25:32,200 --> 10:25:32,720
Nevermind.

15833
10:25:34,060 --> 10:25:34,360
Oh.

15834
10:25:34,620 --> 10:25:35,580
I get the walls.

15835
10:25:35,920 --> 10:25:38,680
Well, we have Groot anyway, we have a group there.

15836
10:25:39,540 --> 10:25:40,100
Okay.

15837
10:25:45,600 --> 10:25:47,180
No circus, because we're winning.

15838
10:25:53,430 --> 10:25:53,990
Wait.

15839
10:25:54,570 --> 10:25:56,790
Let's just tell him that...

15840
10:26:13,150 --> 10:26:14,450
Alright, I'm ready.

15841
10:26:15,810 --> 10:26:18,530
I'm ready to give more of my life to rivals.

15842
10:26:19,630 --> 10:26:21,150
Four lids was my life.

15843
10:26:21,670 --> 10:26:24,350
But, wouldn't it be fabulous to have an all-superhero...

15844
10:26:24,350 --> 10:26:25,690
Thirty seconds before you attack.

15845
10:26:26,030 --> 10:26:26,590
Get ready.

15846
10:26:27,590 --> 10:26:32,740
He was on Planet X, ma'am.

15847
10:26:33,980 --> 10:26:34,920
Alright, here we go.

15848
10:26:36,320 --> 10:26:37,060
That's a real Doki?

15849
10:26:37,420 --> 10:26:37,920
Is it?

15850
10:26:38,940 --> 10:26:39,900
Oh, she...

15851
10:26:41,900 --> 10:26:43,060
Oh, is that me?

15852
10:26:43,580 --> 10:26:44,900
Wait, how does he know?

15853
10:26:45,980 --> 10:26:46,640
No.

15854
10:26:46,900 --> 10:26:47,230
No.

15855
10:26:51,400 --> 10:26:52,760
How do they know?

15856
10:26:53,080 --> 10:26:55,840
Wait, what's the...

15857
10:26:58,200 --> 10:27:00,120
How do they know?

15858
10:27:00,160 --> 10:27:01,360
How do they know?

15859
10:27:03,520 --> 10:27:05,240
I'm on streamer mode.

15860
10:27:09,920 --> 10:27:10,840
I'm going on point.

15861
10:27:10,960 --> 10:27:11,360
How?

15862
10:27:13,740 --> 10:27:15,220
One of the world's mysteries.

15863
10:27:19,320 --> 10:27:27,300
Yeah, and then when they see me, see my name, and they see that it is Doki, I'll be like, yeah, but it's Doki, a bird.

15864
10:27:27,300 --> 10:27:28,460
That's different.

15865
10:27:30,300 --> 10:27:31,300
That's different.

15866
10:27:38,260 --> 10:27:39,400
Oh my god.

15867
10:27:40,120 --> 10:27:40,800
Okay.

15868
10:27:41,380 --> 10:27:41,860
Here we go.

15869
10:27:46,760 --> 10:27:47,760
Oh my god.

15870
10:27:48,540 --> 10:27:48,980
Thank you.

15871
10:27:52,340 --> 10:27:54,740
Jesus Christ, so many things happen there.

15872
10:27:58,050 --> 10:28:00,250
It's Doki, exactly!

15873
10:28:01,490 --> 10:28:02,850
Look who's here.

15874
10:28:02,950 --> 10:28:03,290
Me.

15875
10:28:06,050 --> 10:28:06,570
Okay.

15876
10:28:08,650 --> 10:28:09,890
No, if I say I...

15877
10:28:09,890 --> 10:28:10,110
Whoa.

15878
10:28:23,080 --> 10:28:23,820
Oh no.

15879
10:28:24,080 --> 10:28:25,380
Oh no, they're so far.

15880
10:28:29,880 --> 10:28:31,480
I can all the... oh, y'all...

15881
10:28:33,020 --> 10:28:33,780
Never mind.

15882
10:28:36,080 --> 10:28:37,040
Oh, fear.

15883
10:28:37,260 --> 10:28:38,180
Fear, fear.

15884
10:28:40,380 --> 10:28:40,900
Fear.

15885
10:28:44,880 --> 10:28:45,480
Mine?

15886
10:28:45,680 --> 10:28:45,900
Mine?

15887
10:28:46,260 --> 10:28:46,700
Mine?

15888
10:28:48,220 --> 10:28:48,820
Whoa!

15889
10:28:49,300 --> 10:28:50,340
Ready to put on a show.

15890
10:28:50,920 --> 10:28:51,720
It's okay.

15891
10:28:53,920 --> 10:28:54,660
It's fine.

15892
10:28:55,940 --> 10:28:57,280
Alright, it's fine.

15893
10:28:58,500 --> 10:28:59,360
Jesus Christ.

15894
10:29:02,720 --> 10:29:04,160
This is where I die.

15895
10:29:04,900 --> 10:29:05,920
Oh no.

15896
10:29:09,100 --> 10:29:12,340
I was gonna say unless...

15897
10:29:16,500 --> 10:29:17,140
Alright.

15898
10:29:19,020 --> 10:29:20,420
Yeah, that was...

15899
10:29:20,420 --> 10:29:21,700
A lot of fear.

15900
10:29:21,960 --> 10:29:22,540
Right there.

15901
10:29:23,340 --> 10:29:24,440
Wait, is this Winapa?

15902
10:29:29,660 --> 10:29:30,940
What are you...

15903
10:29:30,940 --> 10:29:31,400
What?

15904
10:29:32,180 --> 10:29:32,800
What?

15905
10:29:32,800 --> 10:29:34,060
I was gonna say...

15906
10:29:34,060 --> 10:29:36,040
Why is he just standing there?

15907
10:29:36,440 --> 10:29:36,800
I...

15908
10:29:40,080 --> 10:29:41,720
There's a lot of fear there.

15909
10:29:44,260 --> 10:29:46,020
What are you trying to do?

15910
10:29:48,860 --> 10:29:50,420
I don't know...

15911
10:29:50,420 --> 10:29:51,720
Did you see that?

15912
10:29:53,520 --> 10:29:55,780
I got so confused.

15913
10:30:03,620 --> 10:30:04,380
I...

15914
10:30:04,380 --> 10:30:06,860
I don't know what he was trying to do.

15915
10:30:07,780 --> 10:30:10,840
Did you see how he was struggling to...

15916
10:30:10,840 --> 10:30:11,700
To climb?

15917
10:30:12,080 --> 10:30:12,460
I...

15918
10:30:12,460 --> 10:30:13,800
I saw it.

15919
10:30:16,220 --> 10:30:16,880
No.

15920
10:30:17,200 --> 10:30:17,600
No.

15921
10:30:20,860 --> 10:30:22,380
You saw that, right?

15922
10:30:22,620 --> 10:30:24,000
The venom couldn't climb?

15923
10:30:24,340 --> 10:30:24,740
The wall.

15924
10:30:25,260 --> 10:30:25,440
Yeah.

15925
10:30:26,480 --> 10:30:31,160
I'm making a comeback.

15926
10:30:32,500 --> 10:30:33,240
I was like...

15927
10:30:33,240 --> 10:30:34,930
He, like, missed the climb, like...

15928
10:30:35,460 --> 10:30:36,460
20 times.

15929
10:30:41,640 --> 10:30:43,420
I was like, is he okay?

15930
10:30:43,420 --> 10:30:43,500
Hey?

15931
10:30:47,940 --> 10:30:49,100
Alright, nice.

15932
10:30:52,260 --> 10:30:53,540
Alright, this is a mag.

15933
10:30:53,560 --> 10:30:54,780
I'm a little worried.

15934
10:30:55,020 --> 10:31:03,860
Oh my god.

15935
10:31:04,180 --> 10:31:04,740
I'm scared.

15936
10:31:05,700 --> 10:31:09,080
I have to save my ult for an actual offensive ult.

15937
10:31:15,040 --> 10:31:15,660
Oh no.

15938
10:31:16,980 --> 10:31:18,920
Oh no, I got worried.

15939
10:31:18,920 --> 10:31:19,560
I got worried.

15940
10:31:19,960 --> 10:31:21,580
I got really worried.

15941
10:31:22,360 --> 10:31:23,780
Oh my god.

15942
10:31:23,780 --> 10:31:26,480
Please tell me you have... Jesus.

15943
10:31:26,940 --> 10:31:29,220
I thought... Not gonna lie.

15944
10:31:30,160 --> 10:31:34,700
I thought he had... Please tell... Oh my god.

15945
10:31:35,380 --> 10:31:38,000
I was like, please tell me he has inbound.

15946
10:31:38,620 --> 10:31:40,480
He did not have inbound.

15947
10:31:54,860 --> 10:31:55,300
Alright.

15948
10:31:55,300 --> 10:31:56,040
Oh no.

15949
10:31:57,520 --> 10:31:58,900
We have one fight left.

15950
10:32:01,100 --> 10:32:01,880
Oh no.

15951
10:32:03,440 --> 10:32:04,660
I am Groot.

15952
10:32:05,260 --> 10:32:06,020
I am Groot?

15953
10:32:11,560 --> 10:32:12,940
Oh, this is sad for me.

15954
10:32:13,140 --> 10:32:14,920
Because I have to like, look at both sides.

15955
10:32:17,860 --> 10:32:18,760
Can I only touch?

15956
10:32:19,620 --> 10:32:20,580
Ah, I don't make it.

15957
10:32:20,720 --> 10:32:21,600
Okay, I don't do that.

15958
10:32:28,020 --> 10:32:28,740
Oh no.

15959
10:32:28,980 --> 10:32:28,980
Oh no.

15960
10:32:31,020 --> 10:32:36,970
Oh my god.

15961
10:32:38,570 --> 10:32:40,310
Come behind.

15962
10:32:40,510 --> 10:32:40,770
Come behind.

15963
10:32:40,970 --> 10:32:41,150
Come behind.

15964
10:32:41,150 --> 10:32:41,250
Come behind.

15965
10:32:41,610 --> 10:32:42,570
Oh no.

15966
10:32:43,670 --> 10:32:44,090
Oh no.

15967
10:32:44,310 --> 10:32:44,330
Oh no.

15968
10:32:46,270 --> 10:32:49,270
Oh my god.

15969
10:32:49,710 --> 10:32:52,570
I'm trying so hard to keep them alive.

15970
10:32:54,130 --> 10:32:59,670
Oh my god.

15971
10:32:59,730 --> 10:32:59,850
Oh my god.

15972
10:33:01,170 --> 10:33:03,130
Oh my god.

15973
10:33:03,130 --> 10:33:04,710
Let me alone.

15974
10:33:05,630 --> 10:33:06,370
Please.

15975
10:33:06,650 --> 10:33:07,530
Are you serious?

15976
10:33:07,910 --> 10:33:10,110
He fucking didn't even follow me.

15977
10:33:14,410 --> 10:33:16,490
He like... Oh my god.

15978
10:33:16,830 --> 10:33:18,890
He fucking ran away from me.

15979
10:33:18,990 --> 10:33:19,970
I'm so sad.

15980
10:33:23,970 --> 10:33:25,630
Oh my

15981
10:33:28,920 --> 10:33:34,360
god.

15982
10:33:34,360 --> 10:33:36,140
Oh, they see Nite.

15983
10:33:36,300 --> 10:33:37,600
Thank God, I have to use it.

15984
10:33:37,960 --> 10:33:43,020
That... I got... I literally got dragged around the world.

15985
10:33:43,400 --> 10:33:46,340
It was like around the world in 80 days.

15986
10:33:46,940 --> 10:33:52,260
And he like took me to... He took me from Canada to like Australia.

15987
10:34:05,550 --> 10:34:07,550
I didn't realize they were going to see Nite.

15988
10:34:07,550 --> 10:34:09,830
If they didn't see Nite, then like that would be good.

15989
10:34:10,130 --> 10:34:10,710
But they see Nite.

15990
10:34:16,330 --> 10:34:18,010
That's how far he took me there.

15991
10:34:21,730 --> 10:34:22,170
Yeah.

15992
10:34:31,400 --> 10:34:33,860
Around the world, around the world.

15993
10:34:35,480 --> 10:34:38,100
Around the world, around the world.

15994
10:34:40,280 --> 10:34:40,920
And...

15995
10:34:41,900 --> 10:34:43,840
What if I get top 500 today?

15996
10:34:47,340 --> 10:34:50,620
What if I do that to you guys?

15997
10:34:57,720 --> 10:34:58,880
That be fun.

15998
10:34:58,880 --> 10:35:02,300
What if I do that to you guys?

15999
10:35:02,320 --> 10:35:03,060
What if I do that to you guys?

16000
10:35:03,060 --> 10:35:04,820
What if I do that to you guys?

16001
10:35:04,820 --> 10:35:08,540
What if I do that to you guys?

16002
10:35:09,700 --> 10:35:13,520
What if I do that to you guys?

16003
10:35:13,520 --> 10:35:15,720
What if I do that to you guys?

16004
10:35:15,720 --> 10:35:17,060
What if I do that to you guys?

16005
10:35:17,060 --> 10:35:18,220
What if I do that to you guys?

16006
10:35:18,240 --> 10:35:18,380
What if I do that to you guys?

16007
10:35:18,380 --> 10:35:18,420
What if I do that to you guys?

16008
10:35:18,420 --> 10:35:20,650
What if I do that to you guys?

16009
10:35:20,690 --> 10:35:23,130
What if I do that

16010
10:35:28,820 --> 10:35:28,820
to you guys?

16011
10:35:28,820 --> 10:35:35,400
What if I do that to you guys?

16012
10:35:35,400 --> 10:35:36,640
How?!

16013
10:35:44,720 --> 10:35:48,220
He killed through the luna ult!

16014
10:35:49,400 --> 10:35:51,740
He actually killed through the luna ult!

16015
10:35:57,300 --> 10:35:59,120
No, he killed through the luna ult.

16016
10:35:59,280 --> 10:36:00,340
That's actually crazy.

16017
10:36:03,820 --> 10:36:05,180
I don't think he's gonna live.

16018
10:36:05,960 --> 10:36:06,560
No way.

16019
10:36:07,140 --> 10:36:07,780
He's backing out.

16020
10:36:17,160 --> 10:36:19,420
Don't worry, I know it gets cut in 12 hours.

16021
10:36:22,140 --> 10:36:24,780
That's crazy that he healed through the luna ult.

16022
10:36:25,560 --> 10:36:26,580
I was like, what?

16023
10:36:26,880 --> 10:36:28,000
Was I not in it?

16024
10:36:28,220 --> 10:36:29,080
I was!

16025
10:36:31,820 --> 10:36:33,640
I was absolutely- Jesus Christ.

16026
10:36:33,940 --> 10:36:35,460
I was absolutely in it.

16027
10:36:39,840 --> 10:36:42,340
So I was like, what the fuck is- WHAT?!

16028
10:36:43,380 --> 10:36:45,180
I am ready to put on a show!

16029
10:36:46,520 --> 10:36:47,840
Oh, I'm sick!

16030
10:36:52,400 --> 10:36:53,780
Okay, that's awkward.

16031
10:36:57,720 --> 10:36:59,060
Okay, that's awkward.

16032
10:36:59,680 --> 10:37:01,140
Oh, that's very awkward.

16033
10:37:02,620 --> 10:37:04,440
Oh, that's so awkward.

16034
10:37:08,280 --> 10:37:10,300
That's so- We're still fighting?!

16035
10:37:14,900 --> 10:37:16,340
Oh my god, it works.

16036
10:37:16,580 --> 10:37:17,040
It's working.

16037
10:37:17,720 --> 10:37:19,200
That was unlucky for me.

16038
10:37:23,360 --> 10:37:25,000
Yeah, it's just us wins this thing.

16039
10:37:25,140 --> 10:37:26,460
Maybe top 500 today?

16040
10:37:33,750 --> 10:37:34,250
Maybe?

16041
10:37:39,270 --> 10:37:42,110
I mean, all I'm saying, guys, is that...

16042
10:37:43,050 --> 10:37:48,570
If I can get top 500 in one session, even though the amount of games I've played might not be, like, that much...

16043
10:37:49,170 --> 10:37:51,190
Like, I think it's pretty impressive.

16044
10:37:52,670 --> 10:37:54,990
I think I'm playing pretty good.

16045
10:37:54,990 --> 10:37:56,130
There's more behind.

16046
10:37:56,210 --> 10:37:56,610
There's more behind.

16047
10:37:57,170 --> 10:37:57,870
There's more left.

16048
10:38:05,680 --> 10:38:06,120
Whoa.

16049
10:38:08,700 --> 10:38:09,140
Oh!

16050
10:38:09,740 --> 10:38:10,380
Where I die.

16051
10:38:10,500 --> 10:38:11,220
This is where I die.

16052
10:38:11,460 --> 10:38:12,200
This is where I die.

16053
10:38:12,460 --> 10:38:14,600
I remember what...

16054
10:38:25,180 --> 10:38:28,120
I knew exactly what was gonna happen.

16055
10:38:31,600 --> 10:38:36,970
I saw Hulk smash, and I knew my fate was sealed.

16056
10:38:38,670 --> 10:38:43,450
When Hulk starts warning that smash, no one is.

16057
10:38:46,630 --> 10:38:47,790
Oh, that's unlucky.

16058
10:38:47,950 --> 10:38:48,670
Yeah, we got one, brother.

16059
10:38:53,600 --> 10:38:54,560
Oh, that was hard.

16060
10:39:07,990 --> 10:39:08,310
Okay.

16061
10:39:16,190 --> 10:39:17,950
Oh my god!

16062
10:39:23,180 --> 10:39:23,800
Okay.

16063
10:39:24,440 --> 10:39:25,200
Wait, what?

16064
10:39:25,600 --> 10:39:25,900
Ugh.

16065
10:39:25,900 --> 10:39:28,140
I am ready to put on a show!

16066
10:39:34,930 --> 10:39:36,010
That was unlucky.

16067
10:39:36,470 --> 10:39:37,210
I think I should...

16068
10:39:37,210 --> 10:39:37,710
Maybe...

16069
10:39:37,710 --> 10:39:38,770
Yeah, the whale got me.

16070
10:39:40,050 --> 10:39:42,270
I'm getting very harassed right now.

16071
10:39:42,410 --> 10:39:43,310
I might play...

16072
10:39:45,070 --> 10:39:46,170
I'm gonna play...

16073
10:39:47,090 --> 10:39:48,770
I'm getting very harassed.

16074
10:39:54,550 --> 10:39:57,830
Not having a good time being juggled around.

16075
10:39:59,050 --> 10:40:01,090
Uh, there was a giant...

16076
10:40:01,650 --> 10:40:01,730
Thing?

16077
10:40:03,910 --> 10:40:04,710
Ugh.

16078
10:40:06,030 --> 10:40:06,870
I don't know.

16079
10:40:07,570 --> 10:40:10,310
I don't really want to play Luna.

16080
10:40:10,890 --> 10:40:13,370
I don't want to play Luna against that.

16081
10:40:14,330 --> 10:40:16,510
I'm just getting punished.

16082
10:40:17,130 --> 10:40:18,230
Every time.

16083
10:40:22,850 --> 10:40:27,430
That's the thing, when there's two Luna ults, it's so hard to see, like, anything else.

16084
10:40:27,690 --> 10:40:30,370
Because the Luna ults is, like, the entire fucking floor.

16085
10:40:33,030 --> 10:40:37,070
So it's so hard to see, like, whatever the fuck is going on.

16086
10:40:37,070 --> 10:40:38,950
I don't want to try to throw snowballs with me, though.

16087
10:40:47,370 --> 10:40:48,350
I am Groot.

16088
10:40:49,510 --> 10:40:50,150
I am Groot.

16089
10:40:57,690 --> 10:40:58,210
Please,

16090
10:41:03,530 --> 10:41:03,830
excuse me.

16091
10:41:08,880 --> 10:41:09,400
No!

16092
10:41:20,700 --> 10:41:22,200
So much damage, though.

16093
10:41:23,100 --> 10:41:24,860
None of us is, like, killing the squid.

16094
10:41:25,060 --> 10:41:25,640
That's the thing.

16095
10:41:26,100 --> 10:41:28,140
The squid is nearly free farming it.

16096
10:41:28,760 --> 10:41:29,820
I'm ready to put on

16097
10:41:33,110 --> 10:41:33,630
a...

16098
10:41:34,090 --> 10:41:35,490
Oh, I'm trying.

16099
10:41:38,830 --> 10:41:39,430
Three.

16100
10:41:40,050 --> 10:41:40,650
Two.

16101
10:41:41,650 --> 10:41:43,670
Why is no one, like, shooting this?

16102
10:41:44,230 --> 10:41:46,530
No one is shooting the Namor squid!

16103
10:41:47,190 --> 10:41:47,590
Why?

16104
10:41:55,380 --> 10:41:56,620
Did you see that?

16105
10:41:56,740 --> 10:41:59,740
I saw the Namor squid free farm us for so long.

16106
10:42:05,010 --> 10:42:07,170
I have to shoot the Namor squid!

16107
10:42:08,330 --> 10:42:11,110
I saw the Namor squid.

16108
10:42:11,690 --> 10:42:14,530
I saw the Namor squid.

16109
10:42:14,530 --> 10:42:16,230
Let me shoot this again!

16110
10:42:22,330 --> 10:42:23,670
That's actually crazy.

16111
10:42:23,850 --> 10:42:26,790
I feel like I'm doing everything I can to shoot them.

16112
10:42:26,790 --> 10:42:28,170
I'm ready to put on a shelf.

16113
10:42:32,120 --> 10:42:33,080
Oh my god.

16114
10:42:33,340 --> 10:42:33,440
Here.

16115
10:42:33,820 --> 10:42:34,300
Here.

16116
10:42:36,240 --> 10:42:37,380
Oh my god.

16117
10:42:37,660 --> 10:42:40,280
I don't know how you can like live through that.

16118
10:42:45,480 --> 10:42:48,940
This is the... I love Marvel Rivals Q.

16119
10:42:53,240 --> 10:42:55,060
I just think we're not shooting squid.

16120
10:42:55,320 --> 10:42:57,060
The Namor is getting so much value.

16121
10:43:00,800 --> 10:43:03,740
The Namor is getting so much value for doing nothing.

16122
10:43:04,160 --> 10:43:05,140
In general.

16123
10:43:07,340 --> 10:43:08,780
Oh, this is bad.

16124
10:43:09,060 --> 10:43:10,480
This is very bad.

16125
10:43:10,860 --> 10:43:13,880
This is very bad for me.

16126
10:43:15,000 --> 10:43:16,200
I'm alive.

16127
10:43:24,650 --> 10:43:25,790
I'm alive.

16128
10:43:26,270 --> 10:43:26,570
Somehow.

16129
10:43:32,270 --> 10:43:33,450
I'm alive.

16130
10:43:33,910 --> 10:43:35,410
I don't know how.

16131
10:43:50,310 --> 10:43:50,830
Really?

16132
10:43:51,090 --> 10:43:52,490
I don't think we needed that.

16133
10:43:59,610 --> 10:44:00,530
Okay, nice.

16134
10:44:03,350 --> 10:44:05,210
Oh, but I have 99 now.

16135
10:44:09,510 --> 10:44:10,550
He did.

16136
10:44:10,910 --> 10:44:11,970
This is me's fault.

16137
10:44:12,290 --> 10:44:13,550
Thank you for the super chat.

16138
10:44:13,710 --> 10:44:13,910
Thank you.

16139
10:44:14,090 --> 10:44:14,450
Thank you.

16140
10:44:14,450 --> 10:44:16,170
He knew exactly what he was doing.

16141
10:44:18,190 --> 10:44:24,750
I think our Loki has like so much... Our Loki definitely has like a lot of...

16142
10:44:26,890 --> 10:44:36,610
Oh my god.

16143
10:44:36,770 --> 10:44:40,110
I... I did not trust...

16144
10:44:48,760 --> 10:44:49,240
Oh.

16145
10:44:57,440 --> 10:44:57,920
Okay...

16146
10:44:59,380 --> 10:45:00,320
Don't kill him.

16147
10:45:00,500 --> 10:45:01,320
Don't kill him.

16148
10:45:03,120 --> 10:45:04,800
Oh, we accidentally kill him.

16149
10:45:08,320 --> 10:45:09,920
No, our Loki is really good.

16150
10:45:10,400 --> 10:45:10,880
Honestly.

16151
10:45:12,900 --> 10:45:14,440
Our Loki is doing really, really well.

16152
10:45:16,880 --> 10:45:18,420
We have well though, so that's scary.

16153
10:45:24,950 --> 10:45:27,090
I hear the whole fear.

16154
10:45:31,730 --> 10:45:32,910
Can we heal each other?

16155
10:45:50,800 --> 10:45:51,360
No!

16156
10:45:57,100 --> 10:45:57,660
Why?

16157
10:46:02,880 --> 10:46:04,760
Did he not copy me?

16158
10:46:05,040 --> 10:46:06,240
Who did he copy?

16159
10:46:14,820 --> 10:46:16,360
Who did he copy?

16160
10:46:16,920 --> 10:46:18,480
Who did he copy?

16161
10:46:19,080 --> 10:46:22,600
Who did he copy?

16162
10:46:22,860 --> 10:46:23,100
Who did he copy?

16163
10:46:23,100 --> 10:46:24,160
Who did he copy?

16164
10:46:28,420 --> 10:46:30,380
That was so winnable too.

16165
10:46:31,040 --> 10:46:32,260
Oh my god!

16166
10:46:33,500 --> 10:46:35,000
He copied them.

16167
10:46:35,120 --> 10:46:37,100
He was playing so well.

16168
10:46:37,820 --> 10:46:39,480
Oh my god!

16169
10:46:41,420 --> 10:46:46,360
That was actually like the game-changing mistake.

16170
10:46:52,890 --> 10:46:54,290
That hurt.

16171
10:46:58,110 --> 10:47:01,250
He was looking at me!

16172
10:47:01,950 --> 10:47:03,530
I was so surprised!

16173
10:47:03,970 --> 10:47:04,950
I was...

16174
10:47:04,950 --> 10:47:07,250
I was not expecting it!

16175
10:47:07,770 --> 10:47:09,990
He looked at me too!

16176
10:47:13,070 --> 10:47:14,710
I don't know how!

16177
10:47:14,710 --> 10:47:16,630
He's a really good player!

16178
10:47:20,560 --> 10:47:23,220
He's actually a really good player!

16179
10:47:24,100 --> 10:47:25,700
So I was really surprised!

16180
10:47:26,400 --> 10:47:28,400
Is that the game they lost against us?

16181
10:47:28,540 --> 10:47:29,160
Oh, it was!

16182
10:47:38,600 --> 10:47:39,620
Okay, I need to see.

16183
10:47:39,860 --> 10:47:40,360
You're right.

16184
10:47:40,560 --> 10:47:41,200
I'm gonna see it.

16185
10:47:41,300 --> 10:47:42,180
He's spectating too.

16186
10:47:42,280 --> 10:47:43,660
He's like, how did I miss?

16187
10:47:44,000 --> 10:47:45,280
I... I don't know either!

16188
10:47:45,280 --> 10:47:46,660
How did you miss?

16189
10:47:50,700 --> 10:47:51,640
I even like...

16190
10:47:51,640 --> 10:47:53,060
I like stood in front of him.

16191
10:47:57,200 --> 10:47:57,820
I know.

16192
10:47:58,780 --> 10:47:59,600
That's so unlucky.

16193
10:47:59,720 --> 10:48:00,560
He's a really good player.

16194
10:48:00,560 --> 10:48:00,580
Here.

16195
10:48:07,440 --> 10:48:07,820
Okay.

16196
10:48:10,380 --> 10:48:11,420
That's unlucky.

16197
10:48:11,540 --> 10:48:13,160
He's playing really well too.

16198
10:48:15,360 --> 10:48:16,480
I need to know.

16199
10:48:24,600 --> 10:48:25,360
What?

16200
10:48:32,610 --> 10:48:32,990
What?

16201
10:48:33,630 --> 10:48:34,370
How?

16202
10:48:39,900 --> 10:48:40,660
Wait!

16203
10:48:42,120 --> 10:48:44,340
I am ready to put on a show!

16204
10:48:48,340 --> 10:48:51,480
Oh my god!

16205
10:48:52,020 --> 10:48:53,180
What?

16206
10:48:56,140 --> 10:48:57,980
That's crazy!

16207
10:48:58,680 --> 10:48:59,680
I don't understand!

16208
10:49:10,430 --> 10:49:12,230
I... I don't understand!

16209
10:49:12,990 --> 10:49:14,390
How did that happen?

16210
10:49:15,450 --> 10:49:16,370
Okay, he looked.

16211
10:49:16,370 --> 10:49:17,930
I am ready to put on a show.

16212
10:49:18,570 --> 10:49:19,570
It's on him.

16213
10:49:20,570 --> 10:49:22,090
He didn't press Q yet.

16214
10:49:22,390 --> 10:49:24,090
He pressed Q here.

16215
10:49:27,390 --> 10:49:28,770
I think it's pink.

16216
10:49:28,950 --> 10:49:30,130
This is a Korean player.

16217
10:49:30,690 --> 10:49:32,070
This is a Korean pro player.

16218
10:49:33,370 --> 10:49:40,950
He's one of the Korean... He's one of the Korean pro players in Barber Rivals.

16219
10:49:43,130 --> 10:49:45,470
That was actually crazy.

16220
10:49:46,370 --> 10:49:48,570
He shouldn't have lost that.

16221
10:49:55,920 --> 10:49:57,840
Oh my god.

16222
10:49:58,200 --> 10:49:59,720
That's so unfortunate.

16223
10:50:00,520 --> 10:50:02,460
That actually...

16224
10:50:03,800 --> 10:50:06,480
That's actually crazy.

16225
10:50:07,780 --> 10:50:09,680
Oh my god.

16226
10:50:12,600 --> 10:50:13,120
Like...

16227
10:50:16,730 --> 10:50:17,250
That's...

16228
10:50:18,510 --> 10:50:20,490
Because I was confused.

16229
10:50:20,490 --> 10:50:22,130
He looked at me.

16230
10:50:22,950 --> 10:50:25,470
He looked... We actually would win that.

16231
10:50:25,670 --> 10:50:28,350
If we win that, if he gets the Luna ult off.

16232
10:50:33,750 --> 10:50:36,270
We lost it because we didn't have a Luna ult.

16233
10:50:44,160 --> 10:50:45,480
That's... Oh my god.

16234
10:50:47,680 --> 10:50:49,760
That was such an insane...

16235
10:50:51,280 --> 10:50:53,120
That's an insane...

16236
10:50:53,120 --> 10:50:53,960
Um... What?

16237
10:50:54,180 --> 10:50:55,600
Which hero do you think you're gonna be today?

16238
10:50:56,620 --> 10:50:57,180
What?

16239
10:50:58,840 --> 10:51:01,460
I am in a full lobby of pros again.

16240
10:51:01,740 --> 10:51:02,020
I...

16241
10:51:07,500 --> 10:51:08,260
Shroud X.

16242
10:51:08,360 --> 10:51:08,860
Shroud X.

16243
10:51:09,440 --> 10:51:10,000
Sentinels.

16244
10:51:11,080 --> 10:51:11,640
Uh...

16245
10:51:11,640 --> 10:51:12,860
First place in MRC.

16246
10:51:13,600 --> 10:51:14,500
In Korea.

16247
10:51:14,660 --> 10:51:15,240
Korean pro.

16248
10:51:15,240 --> 10:51:17,520
I think this is a support pro.

16249
10:51:26,340 --> 10:51:27,340
Pro pro.

16250
10:51:27,960 --> 10:51:28,360
Pro pro.

16251
10:51:29,280 --> 10:51:29,600
Pro.

16252
10:51:41,790 --> 10:51:42,530
All right.

16253
10:51:46,020 --> 10:51:46,760
It's time.

16254
10:51:51,970 --> 10:51:54,270
Might as well go pro and make less money.

16255
10:52:04,770 --> 10:52:06,150
Yum yum yum yum yum.

16256
10:52:08,550 --> 10:52:11,130
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

16257
10:52:11,290 --> 10:52:12,130
I'm Luna Snow.

16258
10:52:12,130 --> 10:52:15,190
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

16259
10:52:18,210 --> 10:52:19,670
It's just the way it is.

16260
10:52:21,730 --> 10:52:25,010
That's why pro players, they go pro and then they stop being pro.

16261
10:52:25,550 --> 10:52:26,690
And go variety.

16262
10:52:30,600 --> 10:52:33,240
Why be pro when I can be a cat girl?

16263
10:52:33,900 --> 10:52:34,160
Meow.

16264
10:52:36,360 --> 10:52:38,100
One meow, one aca.

16265
10:52:44,420 --> 10:52:46,100
The first one's free.

16266
10:52:46,180 --> 10:52:48,560
Ha ha ha ha.

16267
10:52:48,780 --> 10:52:50,280
Ha ha ha ha.

16268
10:52:51,360 --> 10:52:52,000
Freaky.

16269
10:52:52,700 --> 10:52:53,480
Ha ha ha ha.

16270
10:52:53,520 --> 10:52:54,840
Jingga jingga jingga.

16271
10:53:04,480 --> 10:53:06,020
That's how they get ya.

16272
10:53:07,520 --> 10:53:10,340
Go on then, make it a good meow.

16273
10:53:10,840 --> 10:53:13,940
Thank you for the aca soupa.

16274
10:53:14,020 --> 10:53:14,800
Thank you, thank you.

16275
10:53:15,100 --> 10:53:16,260
That's your...

16276
10:53:16,260 --> 10:53:16,880
There it is.

16277
10:53:17,540 --> 10:53:18,580
I read your...

16278
10:53:18,580 --> 10:53:20,160
Should I put it in the soupa?

16279
10:53:23,680 --> 10:53:24,600
There it is.

16280
10:53:24,780 --> 10:53:25,580
I gave it to you.

16281
10:53:27,020 --> 10:53:27,620
Goodbye.

16282
10:53:27,960 --> 10:53:28,260
Goodbye.

16283
10:53:29,420 --> 10:53:30,280
That's sad.

16284
10:53:36,020 --> 10:53:36,620
There.

16285
10:53:38,860 --> 10:53:40,820
Okay, that was sick.

16286
10:53:43,140 --> 10:53:45,860
That was a sick play I just did.

16287
10:53:45,860 --> 10:53:49,780
That was actually a such a fucking sick play.

16288
10:53:50,040 --> 10:53:51,920
Okay, guys, come on.

16289
10:53:54,560 --> 10:53:56,180
Like, come on.

16290
10:53:56,700 --> 10:53:59,020
Did you guys not see a sick play I just did?

16291
10:53:59,360 --> 10:53:59,500
Why?

16292
10:54:01,240 --> 10:54:03,000
Why are we still talking about that?

16293
10:54:03,220 --> 10:54:06,320
Hello, I just did an incredibly sick play.

16294
10:54:06,320 --> 10:54:07,780
Okay, please acknowledge.

16295
10:54:16,860 --> 10:54:18,040
Oh, yeah.

16296
10:54:25,890 --> 10:54:27,650
Sorry, we were mourning.

16297
10:54:28,790 --> 10:54:29,490
Okay, after...

16298
10:54:29,490 --> 10:54:34,270
Okay, after you guys compliment my sick play, maybe I'll get another one.

16299
10:54:34,450 --> 10:54:34,810
No bottom left.

16300
10:54:34,870 --> 10:54:37,030
We were just too disappointed.

16301
10:54:38,090 --> 10:54:38,810
Okay.

16302
10:54:39,510 --> 10:54:41,570
Maybe if you guys...

16303
10:54:42,450 --> 10:54:43,010
Oh.

16304
10:54:43,370 --> 10:54:43,770
Billy!

16305
10:54:44,390 --> 10:54:46,770
Thank you for the Akasufa!

16306
10:54:46,970 --> 10:54:48,590
Oh my god, Billy, thank you!

16307
10:54:48,750 --> 10:54:50,110
Thank you for the Akasufa!

16308
10:54:50,170 --> 10:54:52,310
Thank you for enabling me.

16309
10:54:52,530 --> 10:54:52,650
Okay.

16310
10:54:54,570 --> 10:54:54,890
Oh.

16311
10:54:56,430 --> 10:54:57,550
Guys, I...

16312
10:55:01,930 --> 10:55:03,530
I really appreciate it.

16313
10:55:03,890 --> 10:55:04,310
Nya?

16314
10:55:07,390 --> 10:55:08,190
There, see?

16315
10:55:09,290 --> 10:55:10,630
Not bad person.

16316
10:55:15,510 --> 10:55:17,530
Oh my god, I thought...

16317
10:55:19,770 --> 10:55:22,710
I wanna be like, you ult first.

16318
10:55:33,860 --> 10:55:36,440
I thought our invis was ult, but...

16319
10:55:36,780 --> 10:55:37,640
they didn't.

16320
10:55:38,200 --> 10:55:39,200
Goodbye, crew.

16321
10:55:41,020 --> 10:55:41,420
Goodbye.

16322
10:55:46,650 --> 10:55:47,370
There you go.

16323
10:55:48,430 --> 10:55:52,050
See, all it takes is to just acknowledge my sick play.

16324
10:55:56,430 --> 10:55:57,210
Please, I...

16325
10:55:57,630 --> 10:55:58,030
I...

16326
10:55:58,030 --> 10:55:59,290
healed you so much.

16327
10:55:59,490 --> 10:56:00,090
Yo, you're sick still.

16328
10:56:02,250 --> 10:56:03,350
Cap one, cap one, cap one.

16329
10:56:03,350 --> 10:56:03,710
Cap one, cap one.

16330
10:56:59,410 --> 10:56:59,470
Oh my god.

16331
10:57:04,270 --> 10:57:04,750
Okay.

16332
10:57:04,970 --> 10:57:05,770
Oh my god.

16333
10:57:06,370 --> 10:57:07,250
Jesus Christ.

16334
10:57:08,190 --> 10:57:10,990
I might go... Honestly, I might go low-key.

16335
10:57:11,670 --> 10:57:13,490
Like, this is just too much.

16336
10:57:18,570 --> 10:57:20,670
Oh my god, that's just... it's just too much.

16337
10:57:20,850 --> 10:57:22,010
It's literally just too much.

16338
10:57:28,170 --> 10:57:35,490
I want to swap off so I can play... I need a... I need a... I want to play low-key.

16339
10:57:38,740 --> 10:57:40,980
Everyone can save me.

16340
10:57:45,650 --> 10:57:51,030
This dive... This dive is driving me fucking crazy.

16341
10:57:51,990 --> 10:57:54,730
Oh... my god.

16342
10:57:55,070 --> 10:57:57,470
Oh... my god.

16343
10:57:58,890 --> 10:58:02,570
This dive... this fucking dive.

16344
10:58:10,880 --> 10:58:11,680
Oh my god.

16345
10:58:11,820 --> 10:58:13,080
Thank you for pushing me closer.

16346
10:58:13,300 --> 10:58:13,900
Thank you.

16347
10:58:14,560 --> 10:58:16,840
Thank you for pushing me closer.

16348
10:58:17,220 --> 10:58:19,380
I really appreciate it.

16349
10:58:27,020 --> 10:58:27,740
Nice.

16350
10:58:29,220 --> 10:58:30,600
This is so low.

16351
10:58:31,580 --> 10:58:32,240
Thanks so much.

16352
10:58:32,860 --> 10:58:35,340
Oh my god, I'm going low-key.

16353
10:58:35,460 --> 10:58:38,700
I cannot... I cannot do this anymore.

16354
10:58:38,940 --> 10:58:39,720
I cannot.

16355
10:58:41,100 --> 10:58:42,220
I cannot.

16356
10:58:42,220 --> 10:58:42,360
I cannot.

16357
10:58:42,660 --> 10:58:43,320
This dive.

16358
10:58:44,140 --> 10:58:45,400
This dive.

16359
10:58:50,610 --> 10:58:52,670
I can't do this anymore.

16360
10:58:58,950 --> 10:58:59,750
Okay.

16361
10:59:01,610 --> 10:59:03,930
I am simply not strong enough.

16362
10:59:16,200 --> 10:59:18,640
Where did my lab...?

16363
10:59:26,440 --> 10:59:28,500
Like, it disappeared!

16364
10:59:36,460 --> 10:59:38,640
It actually just disappeared!

16365
10:59:54,380 --> 10:59:55,680
Keep fighting until we have a winner!

16366
10:59:58,440 --> 11:00:00,260
Oh my god.

16367
11:00:00,860 --> 11:00:02,180
It actually disappeared.

16368
11:00:02,660 --> 11:00:04,380
I was so confused.

16369
11:00:15,470 --> 11:00:17,090
I couldn't press it!

16370
11:00:17,850 --> 11:00:19,050
I pressed shift!

16371
11:00:21,910 --> 11:00:23,570
I pressed shift!

16372
11:00:24,030 --> 11:00:25,230
I pressed shift!

16373
11:00:28,130 --> 11:00:29,950
And here we go again.

16374
11:00:30,550 --> 11:00:32,120
The more the merrier...

16375
11:00:32,650 --> 11:00:33,170
Oh my god.

16376
11:00:33,330 --> 11:00:33,950
I pressed shift!

16377
11:00:34,530 --> 11:00:35,210
I pressed shift!

16378
11:00:35,490 --> 11:00:37,190
Where did my Heelys go?

16379
11:00:45,280 --> 11:00:46,780
Be back in here.

16380
11:00:47,540 --> 11:00:48,420
Be back in here.

16381
11:00:52,700 --> 11:00:53,280
No!

16382
11:00:53,540 --> 11:00:54,300
I couldn't!

16383
11:00:54,300 --> 11:00:54,320
What?

16384
11:01:02,760 --> 11:01:04,240
I can't believe it!

16385
11:01:04,300 --> 11:01:04,980
Every time!

16386
11:01:07,000 --> 11:01:09,880
I pressed shift every time, too!

16387
11:01:12,180 --> 11:01:13,760
Oh my god!

16388
11:01:15,660 --> 11:01:17,360
I pressed shift!

16389
11:01:18,940 --> 11:01:21,620
No, I pressed shift, but it didn't go off twice.

16390
11:01:23,100 --> 11:01:25,500
My shift literally didn't go off twice.

16391
11:01:26,640 --> 11:01:27,880
I did it two times.

16392
11:01:36,350 --> 11:01:37,450
That was my bad.

16393
11:01:37,750 --> 11:01:38,310
I had...

16394
11:01:38,310 --> 11:01:38,610
I was...

16395
11:01:38,610 --> 11:01:39,870
I had my ult...

16396
11:01:39,870 --> 11:01:41,110
And I couldn't...

16397
11:01:41,110 --> 11:01:43,370
I pressed shift twice, and it didn't go off.

16398
11:01:45,370 --> 11:01:48,010
Like, this didn't go off for some fucking reason.

16399
11:01:51,310 --> 11:01:52,330
No, it's not ping.

16400
11:01:52,530 --> 11:01:53,290
We're at 68.

16401
11:01:53,590 --> 11:01:55,350
I don't know why it didn't go off.

16402
11:01:56,150 --> 11:01:58,090
I literally spammed it, too.

16403
11:01:59,030 --> 11:02:00,610
They'll be coming in 30 seconds!

16404
11:02:00,730 --> 11:02:02,590
I was, like, so tilted at that.

16405
11:02:04,270 --> 11:02:05,090
I guess it should've...

16406
11:02:06,910 --> 11:02:07,310
Uh...

16407
11:02:13,410 --> 11:02:15,330
And I was trying to find, uh...

16408
11:02:23,180 --> 11:02:23,200
Okay.

16409
11:02:28,000 --> 11:02:30,060
No, because Invisible Woman is more reactive.

16410
11:02:32,980 --> 11:02:35,040
It's more reactive, and you need that as a first ult.

16411
11:02:35,040 --> 11:02:37,660
While low-key, I can, like, time it better.

16412
11:02:37,860 --> 11:02:38,740
I can time it after.

16413
11:02:39,440 --> 11:02:42,220
I just wasn't expecting, uh, Spider-Man.

16414
11:02:45,320 --> 11:02:46,100
This is why.

16415
11:02:46,240 --> 11:02:47,000
This is exactly why.

16416
11:02:47,100 --> 11:02:47,620
This is why.

16417
11:02:48,640 --> 11:02:49,560
This was why.

16418
11:02:50,240 --> 11:02:50,720
I...

16419
11:02:50,720 --> 11:02:51,000
I...

16420
11:03:01,950 --> 11:03:02,430
I...

16421
11:03:02,790 --> 11:03:03,890
Here you go.

16422
11:03:06,970 --> 11:03:08,250
Jesus Christ, we live.

16423
11:03:08,630 --> 11:03:09,990
This is why I just...

16424
11:03:10,570 --> 11:03:11,190
got off of...

16425
11:03:12,470 --> 11:03:14,590
There was a reason why I got off of Luna.

16426
11:03:14,790 --> 11:03:15,650
I don't think he knows.

16427
11:03:17,810 --> 11:03:20,610
Like, I got off of Luna for a reason.

16428
11:03:22,550 --> 11:03:22,900
I...

16429
11:03:24,270 --> 11:03:25,930
I don't think he knows.

16430
11:03:26,410 --> 11:03:27,110
That...

16431
11:03:27,110 --> 11:03:30,690
There is a reason why Invisible Woman was so much better.

16432
11:03:33,710 --> 11:03:35,820
I don't think he realized...

16433
11:03:36,430 --> 11:03:39,010
That Invisible Woman was...

16434
11:03:39,010 --> 11:03:40,710
So much better than Luna.

16435
11:03:41,290 --> 11:03:42,530
Uh, Luna was...

16436
11:03:42,530 --> 11:03:43,790
Is not the player.

16437
11:03:43,790 --> 11:03:43,830
Okay.

16438
11:03:44,110 --> 11:03:45,750
I'll just say that...

16439
11:03:48,990 --> 11:03:52,210
Luna is 100% not the player.

16440
11:03:54,050 --> 11:03:56,050
I was not having fun.

16441
11:03:59,990 --> 11:04:01,850
Well, I have to all at first now.

16442
11:04:03,750 --> 11:04:04,910
I have to use that.

16443
11:04:05,070 --> 11:04:05,350
I just...

16444
11:04:07,890 --> 11:04:09,650
Especially with this dive, too.

16445
11:04:13,240 --> 11:04:14,520
Oh, my God.

16446
11:04:14,620 --> 11:04:15,320
I had to.

16447
11:04:15,560 --> 11:04:16,760
I was gonna die.

16448
11:04:17,400 --> 11:04:18,340
If I didn't.

16449
11:04:23,050 --> 11:04:23,850
Yeah.

16450
11:04:24,870 --> 11:04:25,930
I left you.

16451
11:04:28,810 --> 11:04:30,230
Jesus Christ.

16452
11:04:36,300 --> 11:04:37,780
Oh, my God.

16453
11:04:42,560 --> 11:04:44,540
I have to wait.

16454
11:04:44,540 --> 11:04:44,620
I did it.

16455
11:04:48,160 --> 11:04:48,560
Oh.

16456
11:04:48,820 --> 11:04:49,480
He...

16457
11:04:49,480 --> 11:04:50,080
Aww.

16458
11:04:51,220 --> 11:04:52,440
That's unlucky.

16459
11:04:54,280 --> 11:04:55,560
That's so unlucky.

16460
11:04:55,840 --> 11:04:56,040
No!

16461
11:04:59,560 --> 11:05:00,760
I can touch.

16462
11:05:04,740 --> 11:05:06,280
Wait, who can touch?

16463
11:05:07,740 --> 11:05:09,640
One, two, two.

16464
11:05:15,280 --> 11:05:16,080
Guys...

16465
11:05:16,720 --> 11:05:17,540
I'm sad.

16466
11:05:18,540 --> 11:05:20,620
Back to Celestia...

16467
11:05:20,620 --> 11:05:21,280
Three.

16468
11:05:21,760 --> 11:05:22,540
Which means...

16469
11:05:22,540 --> 11:05:23,160
We keep going.

16470
11:05:29,340 --> 11:05:30,900
You know what that means!

16471
11:05:40,460 --> 11:05:42,620
You know what that means, guys!

16472
11:05:45,040 --> 11:05:45,520
Yeah!

16473
11:05:45,980 --> 11:05:48,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

16474
11:05:48,460 --> 11:05:48,940
Wee.

16475
11:05:51,460 --> 11:05:52,620
Wait, where am I at?

16476
11:05:54,280 --> 11:05:54,760
62.

16477
11:05:55,980 --> 11:05:57,040
I need to win two more games.

16478
11:05:57,940 --> 11:05:59,220
Time to keep going!

16479
11:06:03,980 --> 11:06:05,020
Wee.

16480
11:06:05,180 --> 11:06:05,360
Wee.

16481
11:06:06,020 --> 11:06:06,400
Wee.

16482
11:06:06,400 --> 11:06:06,600
Wee.

16483
11:06:06,620 --> 11:06:07,660
Wee.

16484
11:06:08,020 --> 11:06:08,540
Wee.

16485
11:06:08,540 --> 11:06:08,920
Wee.

16486
11:06:09,160 --> 11:06:09,240
Wee.

16487
11:06:10,840 --> 11:06:11,880
Wee.

16488
11:06:15,800 --> 11:06:16,320
Wee.

16489
11:06:17,080 --> 11:06:17,420
Wee.

16490
11:06:17,420 --> 11:06:17,860
Wee.

16491
11:06:17,860 --> 11:06:18,660
Wee.

16492
11:06:22,120 --> 11:06:23,160
Wee.

16493
11:06:23,260 --> 11:06:24,300
Wee.

16494
11:06:24,660 --> 11:06:25,700
Wee.

16495
11:06:25,860 --> 11:06:26,900
Wee.

16496
11:06:27,640 --> 11:06:28,380
Wee.

16497
11:06:28,380 --> 11:06:30,420
Wait, let's not even die.

16498
11:06:32,560 --> 11:06:34,600
Thank you to the super chat.

16499
11:06:34,780 --> 11:06:35,620
Thank you.

16500
11:06:35,760 --> 11:06:37,520
Okay, but look at this shot though.

16501
11:06:38,820 --> 11:06:39,680
Watch this.

16502
11:06:43,500 --> 11:06:45,140
Watch this though.

16503
11:06:46,480 --> 11:06:47,260
Watch it.

16504
11:06:48,900 --> 11:06:49,620
Boom!

16505
11:06:51,340 --> 11:06:52,960
Okay, that's actually crazy.

16506
11:06:53,180 --> 11:06:54,000
Wait, wait.

16507
11:06:54,260 --> 11:06:55,240
That's actually crazy.

16508
11:06:58,380 --> 11:06:59,680
That's actually an insane thing.

16509
11:07:00,160 --> 11:07:00,720
Wait a minute.

16510
11:07:01,380 --> 11:07:02,620
Oh my god.

16511
11:07:02,800 --> 11:07:04,440
Okay, that flick was actually crazy.

16512
11:07:04,640 --> 11:07:05,660
Wait, what the fuck?

16513
11:07:06,280 --> 11:07:07,860
Where was this Doki?

16514
11:07:14,080 --> 11:07:14,940
Oops, no.

16515
11:07:16,200 --> 11:07:17,640
Where was this Doki?

16516
11:07:17,940 --> 11:07:18,640
Oh my god.

16517
11:07:19,180 --> 11:07:19,740
Watch.

16518
11:07:20,520 --> 11:07:22,280
And then freeze.

16519
11:07:22,940 --> 11:07:23,740
And then...

16520
11:07:23,740 --> 11:07:24,200
Boom!

16521
11:07:24,200 --> 11:07:24,680
Boom!

16522
11:07:27,800 --> 11:07:28,660
Let's do that.

16523
11:07:28,760 --> 11:07:29,600
Let's watch that again.

16524
11:07:30,660 --> 11:07:31,240
Boom!

16525
11:07:31,740 --> 11:07:31,980
Freeze!

16526
11:07:33,400 --> 11:07:33,980
And...

16527
11:07:33,980 --> 11:07:34,140
Boom!

16528
11:07:36,400 --> 11:07:37,540
There you go.

16529
11:07:38,960 --> 11:07:42,620
That's why it died so hard in the dirt of the game.

16530
11:07:46,000 --> 11:07:46,820
That's right.

16531
11:07:47,000 --> 11:07:48,820
I actually comboed that fucker.

16532
11:07:51,840 --> 11:07:53,520
But like, we weren't gonna win that.

16533
11:07:57,860 --> 11:07:59,060
NC, thank you for the super chat.

16534
11:07:59,180 --> 11:07:59,360
Thank you.

16535
11:07:59,520 --> 11:07:59,780
Thank you.

16536
11:07:59,820 --> 11:08:02,000
I just wanna say, you made me realize that you should...

16537
11:08:02,000 --> 11:08:03,120
Keep going...

16538
11:08:03,120 --> 11:08:04,620
In note life, no matter what.

16539
11:08:04,680 --> 11:08:06,960
As I like to say, we are Phoenix's Rise of the Lashes.

16540
11:08:07,140 --> 11:08:07,940
Thank you for the super chat.

16541
11:08:08,060 --> 11:08:08,300
Thank you.

16542
11:08:08,420 --> 11:08:09,100
Thank you.

16543
11:08:09,500 --> 11:08:10,560
I appreciate that.

16544
11:08:11,800 --> 11:08:13,380
Okay, they have...

16545
11:08:13,380 --> 11:08:14,780
Oh, we have... them again.

16546
11:08:15,360 --> 11:08:16,460
Wait, it's the same team.

16547
11:08:17,320 --> 11:08:19,640
It's the same fucking team.

16548
11:08:22,520 --> 11:08:23,660
I swear...

16549
11:08:24,040 --> 11:08:25,500
Is this like a rematch?

16550
11:08:25,920 --> 11:08:26,980
Oh my god.

16551
11:08:27,320 --> 11:08:29,740
It's literally the same fucking team.

16552
11:08:34,100 --> 11:08:35,960
Guys, we didn't do so well.

16553
11:08:35,960 --> 11:08:39,040
I think we're the same fucking team.

16554
11:08:39,440 --> 11:08:40,300
I'm not gonna vanish from this match.

16555
11:08:42,060 --> 11:08:43,340
I'm not worried.

16556
11:08:50,940 --> 11:08:52,660
Pan Spider-Man.

16557
11:09:01,520 --> 11:09:03,080
I swear to god.

16558
11:09:03,820 --> 11:09:05,840
I don't... everyone's traumatized.

16559
11:09:09,460 --> 11:09:10,980
He's like...

16560
11:09:10,980 --> 11:09:12,940
But I won bad.

16561
11:09:14,780 --> 11:09:17,280
No one wants to play...

16562
11:09:17,980 --> 11:09:20,000
Wants to play against him.

16563
11:09:27,300 --> 11:09:28,060
Oh no.

16564
11:09:28,880 --> 11:09:29,960
Oh no.

16565
11:09:30,380 --> 11:09:30,940
Oh no.

16566
11:09:31,620 --> 11:09:33,000
Oh, we got it.

16567
11:09:33,140 --> 11:09:33,760
Oh, thank god.

16568
11:09:33,940 --> 11:09:34,440
We got it.

16569
11:09:39,140 --> 11:09:39,900
Now I'm aware.

16570
11:09:48,320 --> 11:09:49,160
No, no, no.

16571
11:09:49,970 --> 11:09:50,860
I have like...

16572
11:09:50,860 --> 11:09:51,840
I have...

16573
11:09:52,760 --> 11:09:54,100
40 minutes left.

16574
11:09:56,300 --> 11:09:57,900
I keep track of time.

16575
11:10:03,100 --> 11:10:04,980
You ult first.

16576
11:10:05,840 --> 11:10:06,620
There we go.

16577
11:10:07,220 --> 11:10:08,040
I keep...

16578
11:10:08,040 --> 11:10:08,880
I let that go in.

16579
11:10:13,160 --> 11:10:14,270
I say that now.

16580
11:10:15,630 --> 11:10:17,270
I tried to stay positive.

16581
11:10:21,810 --> 11:10:22,570
40 minutes left.

16582
11:10:22,670 --> 11:10:23,390
That's like a good three games.

16583
11:10:23,510 --> 11:10:24,370
That's like three wins.

16584
11:10:24,990 --> 11:10:25,070
Right?

16585
11:10:28,230 --> 11:10:29,030
I believe.

16586
11:10:29,510 --> 11:10:30,490
That's three wins.

16587
11:10:32,930 --> 11:10:33,330
Yeah.

16588
11:10:35,470 --> 11:10:35,870
Yeah.

16589
11:10:41,570 --> 11:10:43,010
You know, if I was on Twitch, I...

16590
11:10:43,010 --> 11:10:45,310
I would not have been limited by...

16591
11:10:46,370 --> 11:10:47,170
By YouTube.

16592
11:10:47,490 --> 11:10:49,130
Okay guys, but what if I keep going on Twitch?

16593
11:10:49,810 --> 11:10:50,150
Two...

16594
11:10:50,550 --> 11:10:50,890
One.

16595
11:10:51,730 --> 11:10:52,330
There, Cap.

16596
11:10:53,970 --> 11:10:54,990
A little health please.

16597
11:10:54,990 --> 11:10:55,550
A little health please.

16598
11:10:55,610 --> 11:10:55,910
A little health please.

16599
11:10:55,910 --> 11:10:56,130
A little health please.

16600
11:10:56,150 --> 11:10:56,430
A little health please.

16601
11:10:56,430 --> 11:10:57,550
A little health please.

16602
11:10:57,550 --> 11:10:57,970
A little health please.

16603
11:10:57,970 --> 11:10:58,110
A little health please.

16604
11:10:58,270 --> 11:10:59,470
A little

16605
11:11:02,950 --> 11:11:05,630
health please.

16606
11:11:05,630 --> 11:11:12,050
A little health please.

16607
11:11:14,670 --> 11:11:24,920
A little health please.

16608
11:11:24,920 --> 11:11:26,360
Oh, they also have the frozen thing.

16609
11:11:31,710 --> 11:11:35,090
Jesus Christ, there's so many things going on right now, on my screen.

16610
11:11:35,790 --> 11:11:38,250
I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

16611
11:11:45,920 --> 11:11:46,360
Nice.

16612
11:11:47,780 --> 11:11:49,200
Yo, wolf here, wolf here.

16613
11:11:50,260 --> 11:11:50,960
Wolf where?

16614
11:11:51,220 --> 11:11:51,780
I'm scared.

16615
11:11:56,080 --> 11:11:56,760
Me too.

16616
11:11:58,840 --> 11:11:59,840
I'm scared too.

16617
11:12:00,720 --> 11:12:01,540
Don't worry.

16618
11:12:07,450 --> 11:12:09,330
I'm here for a quick time.

16619
11:12:18,110 --> 11:12:22,100
Jesus, I saw him walk away, so I tried to...

16620
11:12:22,610 --> 11:12:25,490
Oh, that's awkward.

16621
11:12:35,130 --> 11:12:37,130
Oh my god, I did it.

16622
11:12:39,250 --> 11:12:39,910
Nice.

16623
11:12:47,240 --> 11:12:48,660
I couldn't see the hella!

16624
11:12:51,240 --> 11:12:52,960
That was my bad, I fucked up.

16625
11:12:53,020 --> 11:12:53,620
I threw that.

16626
11:12:54,280 --> 11:12:56,360
I literally did not see the hella.

16627
11:13:00,300 --> 11:13:01,220
I walk.

16628
11:13:01,860 --> 11:13:03,780
The vehicle reached a checkpoint.

16629
11:13:03,960 --> 11:13:05,060
Keep up the momentum.

16630
11:13:07,440 --> 11:13:09,760
That was my bad shit, I fucking walked in that.

16631
11:13:11,380 --> 11:13:14,980
I was like, let me walk into the invis us.

16632
11:13:15,760 --> 11:13:18,040
What's the worst that could happen?

16633
11:13:18,040 --> 11:13:18,120
I'm in!

16634
11:13:19,300 --> 11:13:21,040
Apparently many things.

16635
11:13:27,750 --> 11:13:28,390
I'm in here.

16636
11:13:28,390 --> 11:13:30,770
Many bad things can happen to me.

16637
11:13:31,190 --> 11:13:32,570
Who would I thought?

16638
11:13:33,550 --> 11:13:35,210
Jesus Christ, he lives that?

16639
11:13:46,190 --> 11:13:47,710
I need kills though.

16640
11:13:48,970 --> 11:13:50,570
I got y'all missing this up, a woman.

16641
11:13:51,550 --> 11:13:52,450
I'm on cart.

16642
11:13:55,430 --> 11:13:56,390
He's on cart.

16643
11:13:56,590 --> 11:13:56,910
He's on cart.

16644
11:13:58,390 --> 11:13:59,650
Wait, we're on triple team.

16645
11:14:05,180 --> 11:14:05,660
Nice.

16646
11:14:06,760 --> 11:14:07,180
Oh.

16647
11:14:11,440 --> 11:14:12,580
What the fuck, it's working.

16648
11:14:21,580 --> 11:14:22,720
Oh my god, peace.

16649
11:14:22,720 --> 11:14:22,800
Please.

16650
11:14:27,320 --> 11:14:28,520
Okay, goodbye.

16651
11:14:29,960 --> 11:14:31,580
Everything is a-okay.

16652
11:14:31,860 --> 11:14:33,300
Everything is a-okay.

16653
11:14:34,260 --> 11:14:36,020
Everything is a-okay.

16654
11:14:36,120 --> 11:14:36,880
Wait, that's cute.

16655
11:14:37,920 --> 11:14:38,560
Wait, that's cute.

16656
11:14:41,600 --> 11:14:42,580
Help me.

16657
11:14:45,820 --> 11:14:46,500
Goodbye.

16658
11:14:47,920 --> 11:14:49,780
Help, help me.

16659
11:14:52,060 --> 11:14:53,720
That's so sad.

16660
11:14:53,720 --> 11:14:55,680
That's so sad.

16661
11:14:56,040 --> 11:14:57,540
That's so sad.

16662
11:14:59,100 --> 11:14:59,740
That's so sad.

16663
11:14:59,800 --> 11:15:01,240
Oh my god.

16664
11:15:05,930 --> 11:15:08,130
You sounded so depressed.

16665
11:15:08,390 --> 11:15:09,110
What happened?

16666
11:15:13,410 --> 11:15:15,790
Jesus Christ, you're still trying to kill him.

16667
11:15:16,350 --> 11:15:17,490
Oh my god.

16668
11:15:17,890 --> 11:15:18,690
Oh, he's dead.

16669
11:15:19,570 --> 11:15:20,350
He's dead.

16670
11:15:29,570 --> 11:15:30,210
Okay.

16671
11:15:32,350 --> 11:15:34,110
Oh nice, he just wasted it.

16672
11:15:38,390 --> 11:15:38,790
Yeah.

16673
11:15:38,790 --> 11:15:42,030
I know, I was like, what the- I was like, what the fuck?

16674
11:15:46,830 --> 11:15:47,230
Yeah.

16675
11:15:48,630 --> 11:15:49,830
He was-he's like, please...

16676
11:15:50,890 --> 11:15:51,690
Somebody help.

16677
11:15:52,450 --> 11:15:53,090
He's a master.

16678
11:15:58,390 --> 11:16:00,030
Okay, I still have my ult.

16679
11:16:02,130 --> 11:16:03,090
Alright, Baba.

16680
11:16:07,060 --> 11:16:09,100
Like, won anybody please help me?

16681
11:16:10,860 --> 11:16:12,780
I wish not.

16682
11:16:15,120 --> 11:16:16,200
Who's alive?

16683
11:16:17,520 --> 11:16:18,640
Every, all of us.

16684
11:16:18,860 --> 11:16:19,020
Nice.

16685
11:16:19,840 --> 11:16:21,780
3, 2, 1.

16686
11:16:27,500 --> 11:16:28,900
No, I got you!

16687
11:16:29,240 --> 11:16:30,020
Got you!

16688
11:16:32,980 --> 11:16:33,660
Nice.

16689
11:16:35,040 --> 11:16:39,000
The current score is... 3, 2, 1.

16690
11:16:39,460 --> 11:16:39,460
Yeah!

16691
11:16:40,700 --> 11:16:41,120
Wow.

16692
11:16:42,100 --> 11:16:42,300
Wow.

16693
11:16:44,160 --> 11:16:45,740
No, the bad will exist.

16694
11:16:46,040 --> 11:16:50,700
I still have a few... I still have... I can sneak one more game in.

16695
11:16:53,420 --> 11:16:58,240
I can sneak in one more game before I swap over to Twitch.

16696
11:17:00,060 --> 11:17:01,460
No, it just cuts out.

16697
11:17:05,780 --> 11:17:08,660
And then we get to Celestia too, and then... and then we'll call it maybe.

16698
11:17:11,100 --> 11:17:14,080
Then maybe we'll call it... maybe.

16699
11:17:15,140 --> 11:17:17,320
Depends on how I feel laughing.

16700
11:17:21,600 --> 11:17:24,680
I can't raid my own waiting room, guys!

16701
11:17:25,200 --> 11:17:25,820
What is he doing?

16702
11:17:42,180 --> 11:17:43,980
Alright, Celestia 1.

16703
11:17:44,800 --> 11:17:46,320
You're so right!

16704
11:17:46,960 --> 11:17:50,200
Why stop at Celestia 2?

16705
11:17:50,680 --> 11:17:52,420
You're not gonna be at Celestia 1.

16706
11:17:57,280 --> 11:17:58,280
You're so right!

16707
11:17:58,580 --> 11:18:01,460
4, 3, 2, 1.

16708
11:18:03,200 --> 11:18:05,080
I was not paying attention.

16709
11:18:05,480 --> 11:18:05,720
Whoops.

16710
11:18:16,590 --> 11:18:17,530
Alright, there we go.

16711
11:18:17,950 --> 11:18:18,930
He has a snowflake now.

16712
11:18:22,010 --> 11:18:23,030
What the fuck?

16713
11:18:24,650 --> 11:18:25,790
We're in Triple T?

16714
11:18:25,790 --> 11:18:25,810
I think?

16715
11:18:27,570 --> 11:18:30,450
Oh, that's why they went Moon Knight.

16716
11:18:30,590 --> 11:18:31,970
I was like, why Triple T?

16717
11:18:37,540 --> 11:18:39,620
Oh, I dodged... I went dodged the wrong way.

16718
11:18:39,900 --> 11:18:42,520
I don't know if Triple T's the answer right now.

16719
11:18:42,920 --> 11:18:43,280
I...

16720
11:18:47,440 --> 11:18:48,000
Yeah...

16721
11:18:51,780 --> 11:18:54,360
I am definitely not living.

16722
11:19:11,980 --> 11:19:12,540
Okay.

16723
11:19:13,200 --> 11:19:13,860
That's a lot better.

16724
11:19:14,220 --> 11:19:14,540
Okay.

16725
11:19:14,620 --> 11:19:15,060
That's a lot better.

16726
11:19:21,200 --> 11:19:23,300
We go to the left, to the left.

16727
11:19:30,840 --> 11:19:31,400
Yay!

16728
11:19:34,060 --> 11:19:34,920
There you go.

16729
11:19:36,460 --> 11:19:37,220
We move forward.

16730
11:19:37,880 --> 11:19:38,680
That's fine.

16731
11:19:39,120 --> 11:19:40,000
I believe.

16732
11:19:40,280 --> 11:19:40,680
Look, see?

16733
11:19:40,740 --> 11:19:41,220
He's gone.

16734
11:19:41,520 --> 11:19:42,880
He won't hurt you anymore.

16735
11:19:43,800 --> 11:19:44,360
Oh...

16736
11:19:47,340 --> 11:19:48,360
Don't worry.

16737
11:19:49,380 --> 11:19:51,860
The scary man won't hurt you anymore.

16738
11:20:00,680 --> 11:20:01,700
That's fine.

16739
11:20:02,180 --> 11:20:04,040
That's fine.

16740
11:20:05,700 --> 11:20:07,200
Oh, my God.

16741
11:20:09,340 --> 11:20:10,660
Oh, my God.

16742
11:20:10,960 --> 11:20:11,640
Where...

16743
11:20:11,640 --> 11:20:11,860
Oh!

16744
11:20:15,400 --> 11:20:16,640
Oh, my God.

16745
11:20:16,800 --> 11:20:18,020
I got fucking...

16746
11:20:18,900 --> 11:20:19,860
I'm sad.

16747
11:20:19,860 --> 11:20:21,560
I've still got songs to sing.

16748
11:20:21,820 --> 11:20:23,860
I didn't know my Sue died.

16749
11:20:29,500 --> 11:20:30,060
Really?

16750
11:20:32,740 --> 11:20:34,060
She, like, didn't...

16751
11:20:34,060 --> 11:20:34,460
Okay.

16752
11:20:34,620 --> 11:20:35,100
Sorry.

16753
11:20:38,480 --> 11:20:40,200
Wait, where is he portling to?

16754
11:20:45,200 --> 11:20:46,180
Oh, I hear him.

16755
11:20:49,790 --> 11:20:50,390
Okay.

16756
11:20:50,510 --> 11:20:50,890
Okay.

16757
11:20:50,890 --> 11:20:50,930
Goodbye.

16758
11:20:56,270 --> 11:20:56,870
Okay.

16759
11:20:57,030 --> 11:20:57,350
Goodbye.

16760
11:20:57,790 --> 11:20:58,390
Okay.

16761
11:21:00,350 --> 11:21:00,690
Oh.

16762
11:21:01,430 --> 11:21:03,410
Me and this other...

16763
11:21:03,410 --> 11:21:03,930
Support.

16764
11:21:04,210 --> 11:21:05,850
We do not have any chemistry.

16765
11:21:06,310 --> 11:21:06,990
At all.

16766
11:21:07,690 --> 11:21:08,970
I would say it.

16767
11:21:14,770 --> 11:21:18,170
We definitely do not have any synergy at all.

16768
11:21:19,690 --> 11:21:20,050
Please!

16769
11:21:20,830 --> 11:21:20,950
Oh!

16770
11:21:25,200 --> 11:21:26,680
Oh my God!

16771
11:21:26,880 --> 11:21:29,620
I just want a little bit of heals!

16772
11:21:30,140 --> 11:21:30,640
I'm dead.

16773
11:21:30,640 --> 11:21:30,840
Oh my God.

16774
11:21:37,300 --> 11:21:37,740
Oh my God.

16775
11:21:42,100 --> 11:21:42,880
I like...

16776
11:21:42,880 --> 11:21:43,640
I can't live!

16777
11:21:49,480 --> 11:21:49,920
I'm dead.

16778
11:21:49,920 --> 11:21:51,760
My other support, like, is positioning...

16779
11:21:52,480 --> 11:21:52,840
I need...

16780
11:21:52,840 --> 11:21:54,080
I'm avoiding this other support.

16781
11:21:54,360 --> 11:21:54,800
We have...

16782
11:21:54,800 --> 11:21:55,560
They might be...

16783
11:21:55,560 --> 11:21:58,520
They could be a good player, but we have no chemistry at all.

16784
11:21:58,520 --> 11:22:04,980
We have no synergy... as a duo, um, together, playing together.

16785
11:22:05,400 --> 11:22:14,180
Like, it's actually... we're actually, like, so un-synergized.

16786
11:22:16,360 --> 11:22:20,120
It's actually crazy how un-synergized we are.

16787
11:22:24,160 --> 11:22:25,060
Oh my god.

16788
11:22:32,700 --> 11:22:33,540
Oh my god.

16789
11:22:33,860 --> 11:22:34,540
Oh my god.

16790
11:22:34,680 --> 11:22:37,980
There's a hella... there's a hella right behind us.

16791
11:22:38,500 --> 11:22:40,820
Oh my... please.

16792
11:22:50,820 --> 11:22:51,880
Oh my god, thank god.

16793
11:22:54,840 --> 11:22:55,660
Thank god.

16794
11:22:56,340 --> 11:22:57,480
Oh, thank god.

16795
11:22:58,720 --> 11:23:00,540
Oh my god, that was a freeze.

16796
11:23:00,740 --> 11:23:02,300
That could have been a... do you guys see that?

16797
11:23:02,300 --> 11:23:03,960
I could have gotten a freeze.

16798
11:23:04,560 --> 11:23:05,000
I...

16799
11:23:10,620 --> 11:23:14,100
That... if he... if he didn't block that, that was another freeze right there.

16800
11:23:19,480 --> 11:23:21,020
I am... he's scared now.

16801
11:23:21,140 --> 11:23:22,360
He knows I land freezes.

16802
11:23:34,680 --> 11:23:35,880
Oh, I missed that one.

16803
11:23:36,900 --> 11:23:37,580
Okay.

16804
11:23:38,360 --> 11:23:39,040
Okay.

16805
11:23:39,040 --> 11:23:39,120
Okay.

16806
11:23:44,360 --> 11:23:45,720
Oh my...

16807
11:23:45,720 --> 11:23:47,660
Oh... oh... oh...

16808
11:23:47,660 --> 11:23:47,800
What

16809
11:23:53,290 --> 11:23:53,390
happened?

16810
11:23:53,910 --> 11:23:55,690
My game like... oh my god.

16811
11:23:55,870 --> 11:23:57,810
I think I played too long.

16812
11:23:58,430 --> 11:23:58,730
I...

16813
11:24:01,590 --> 11:24:02,790
I thought Crash.

16814
11:24:06,350 --> 11:24:07,310
Wait...

16815
11:24:07,310 --> 11:24:08,310
Wait is Doakitty gone?

16816
11:24:09,050 --> 11:24:10,870
My Vtube studio crashed.

16817
11:24:11,530 --> 11:24:12,230
I'm just saying.

16818
11:24:13,630 --> 11:24:15,170
Sorry it crashed!

16819
11:24:19,810 --> 11:24:21,050
Oh, nice.

16820
11:24:23,690 --> 11:24:24,210
Oh.

16821
11:24:24,710 --> 11:24:24,850
Oh.

16822
11:24:35,090 --> 11:24:36,010
Okay, nice.

16823
11:24:38,150 --> 11:24:39,150
We did it.

16824
11:24:41,030 --> 11:24:42,030
Oh my god.

16825
11:24:42,930 --> 11:24:44,710
We did... Okay, I don't know what happened.

16826
11:24:44,710 --> 11:24:45,810
That scared me.

16827
11:24:46,010 --> 11:24:47,430
I was like, what happened?

16828
11:24:49,230 --> 11:24:50,710
No kitty disappeared.

16829
11:24:51,790 --> 11:24:53,390
Wait, I could put one more game in.

16830
11:25:21,740 --> 11:25:24,240
Oh, this is... Oh, is this a Shroud X?

16831
11:25:24,300 --> 11:25:24,900
I knew it.

16832
11:25:24,960 --> 11:25:26,000
I knew this was a smurf.

16833
11:25:26,900 --> 11:25:29,100
I knew that was a smurf.

16834
11:25:30,340 --> 11:25:31,360
Or an ulti count.

16835
11:25:37,490 --> 11:25:38,790
Alright, let's see.

16836
11:25:44,280 --> 11:25:46,300
Alright, let me get that stuff back on.

16837
11:25:53,920 --> 11:25:55,100
Alright, guys, don't worry.

16838
11:25:55,220 --> 11:25:56,220
I'll be back soon.

16839
11:25:58,740 --> 11:26:01,000
Don't worry, I'm just making sure I get everything in.

16840
11:26:10,640 --> 11:26:11,080
Alright.

16841
11:26:11,080 --> 11:26:11,720
I'm back?

16842
11:26:12,060 --> 11:26:12,500
Wait.

16843
11:26:12,720 --> 11:26:13,080
Oh, I am.

16844
11:26:16,040 --> 11:26:17,000
Don't worry, I'll be back.

16845
11:26:17,200 --> 11:26:18,120
I should show up.

16846
11:26:19,300 --> 11:26:19,740
Right?

16847
11:26:21,360 --> 11:26:22,300
Oh, there I go.

16848
11:26:22,300 --> 11:26:24,760
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

16849
11:26:25,160 --> 11:26:26,420
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

16850
11:26:32,910 --> 11:26:33,830
I'm back.

16851
11:26:35,170 --> 11:26:36,950
Oh, so there's 3 stacking.

16852
11:26:40,620 --> 11:26:41,540
They're good.

16853
11:26:41,660 --> 11:26:44,180
But like, we literally have 0 chemistry.

16854
11:26:49,880 --> 11:26:52,480
I was literally struggling so hard.

16855
11:26:54,000 --> 11:26:56,960
I was struggling so hard to play with this person.

16856
11:26:57,440 --> 11:27:04,920
Because, like, we can be... they can be good players, but, like, me and that person just did not work well together.

16857
11:27:11,040 --> 11:27:12,660
I'm gonna use the bathroom, guys.

16858
11:27:12,800 --> 11:27:13,400
I'll be right back.

16859
11:27:13,740 --> 11:27:18,540
I have... I can do one more game before... before... before I move to...

16860
11:27:19,540 --> 11:27:22,060
I can do one more game before I move to...

16861
11:27:24,020 --> 11:27:27,540
But, if we win this game, we don't have to do one more game.

16862
11:27:28,980 --> 11:27:29,800
We'll be right back.

16863
11:27:29,920 --> 11:27:30,500
I need to use the bathroom.

16864
11:29:23,640 --> 11:29:24,040
Yes!

16865
11:29:24,280 --> 11:29:25,340
There won't be enough time.

16866
11:29:26,060 --> 11:29:26,780
Just believe.

16867
11:29:27,400 --> 11:29:30,080
We get a game within the next...

16868
11:29:31,360 --> 11:29:32,300
5 minutes.

16869
11:29:32,800 --> 11:29:34,740
We have just enough time.

16870
11:29:35,160 --> 11:29:36,780
Because each match is like...

16871
11:29:37,380 --> 11:29:43,240
Also, Ghost, Zekra, Nexi, Morphans, Mehdi, Alan, Duck...

16872
11:29:43,240 --> 11:29:43,980
Thank you for the super chat.

16873
11:29:44,100 --> 11:29:45,020
Thank you.

16874
11:29:45,240 --> 11:29:48,260
Because each game... I'm gonna fucking sleep so much after this.

16875
11:29:49,620 --> 11:29:51,880
Because each game is like...

16876
11:29:51,880 --> 11:29:52,580
12 minutes.

16877
11:29:53,300 --> 11:29:54,720
So that's just...

16878
11:29:54,720 --> 11:29:55,640
Oh...

16879
11:29:55,640 --> 11:29:56,020
Wait.

16880
11:29:56,380 --> 11:29:57,720
Yeah, that's just enough.

16881
11:29:58,120 --> 11:30:00,840
That's literally just enough, guys.

16882
11:30:01,600 --> 11:30:02,820
To make it through.

16883
11:30:03,140 --> 11:30:05,040
But if we get this, that... that sucks.

16884
11:30:05,180 --> 11:30:05,700
But like...

16885
11:30:05,700 --> 11:30:06,640
If we get...

16886
11:30:06,640 --> 11:30:07,600
If we get domination...

16887
11:30:07,600 --> 11:30:08,850
And we win...

16888
11:30:09,360 --> 11:30:11,040
Then it'll be a good day.

16889
11:30:12,080 --> 11:30:13,880
It will be a good day.

16890
11:30:17,410 --> 11:30:19,030
My stats are so bad now.

16891
11:30:19,510 --> 11:30:20,930
Oh no, it's not that bad.

16892
11:30:21,890 --> 11:30:22,730
Yeah, wait, look.

16893
11:30:23,730 --> 11:30:24,250
Don't...

16894
11:30:24,250 --> 11:30:24,790
Don't look at that.

16895
11:30:27,370 --> 11:30:28,410
This wasn't...

16896
11:30:28,410 --> 11:30:29,530
Practice versus AI.

16897
11:30:34,730 --> 11:30:36,010
Yeah, the whole...

16898
11:30:36,010 --> 11:30:36,890
Three hours...

16899
11:30:36,890 --> 11:30:39,230
Because I want to play...

16900
11:30:39,230 --> 11:30:39,550
All...

16901
11:30:39,550 --> 11:30:40,590
Damage Rocket, guys.

16902
11:30:40,790 --> 11:30:41,110
It was...

16903
11:30:41,110 --> 11:30:41,530
Totally...

16904
11:30:42,150 --> 11:30:43,770
Three hours of Damage Rocket.

16905
11:30:45,470 --> 11:30:46,190
Um...

16906
11:30:49,150 --> 11:30:50,490
I mean...

16907
11:30:50,490 --> 11:30:52,010
Look at these stats, though.

16908
11:30:52,450 --> 11:30:53,710
It's a pretty good...

16909
11:30:54,150 --> 11:30:55,150
I mean...

16910
11:30:55,150 --> 11:30:56,410
Those are pretty...

16911
11:30:56,410 --> 11:30:57,910
Pretty good...

16912
11:30:57,910 --> 11:30:58,510
Win rate.

16913
11:31:01,290 --> 11:31:01,810
Yippee!

16914
11:31:07,100 --> 11:31:07,620
My...

16915
11:31:07,620 --> 11:31:08,780
Oh, she is tainted.

16916
11:31:09,300 --> 11:31:11,520
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

16917
11:31:11,700 --> 11:31:12,620
Thank you, thank you.

16918
11:31:12,840 --> 11:31:14,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

16919
11:31:14,720 --> 11:31:15,000
I...

16920
11:31:15,000 --> 11:31:16,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

16921
11:31:17,240 --> 11:31:17,640
Woof.

16922
11:31:19,600 --> 11:31:21,020
Yeah, that's when I was...

16923
11:31:21,020 --> 11:31:21,780
Yes, exactly.

16924
11:31:21,900 --> 11:31:22,440
I was...

16925
11:31:22,440 --> 11:31:23,920
I was farming skins, guys.

16926
11:31:25,780 --> 11:31:28,040
That's exactly what that was.

16927
11:31:31,870 --> 11:31:32,910
I'll say...

16928
11:31:33,950 --> 11:31:34,550
Oh...

16929
11:31:34,550 --> 11:31:35,610
Oh, wait...

16930
11:31:37,190 --> 11:31:37,790
Wait...

16931
11:31:37,790 --> 11:31:40,350
Wait, that team is, like, stacked as hell.

16932
11:31:47,550 --> 11:31:48,950
Oh, hey, it's Domination!

16933
11:31:49,250 --> 11:31:50,950
That's exactly what I asked for!

16934
11:31:52,310 --> 11:31:54,410
If we win this...

16935
11:31:55,150 --> 11:31:55,990
It's over.

16936
11:31:57,510 --> 11:31:59,310
I can end stream.

16937
11:32:18,290 --> 11:32:20,150
I guess this is a low-key map.

16938
11:32:20,810 --> 11:32:22,830
I guess

16939
11:32:39,360 --> 11:32:39,360
this is a low-key map.

16940
11:32:39,360 --> 11:32:39,680
No!

16941
11:32:41,540 --> 11:32:42,060
No!

16942
11:32:44,320 --> 11:32:45,580
Do you not want to be freed?

16943
11:32:45,580 --> 11:32:47,320
From my grasp?

16944
11:32:52,220 --> 11:32:52,880
Yeah...

16945
11:32:52,880 --> 11:32:53,940
Pick your hero!

16946
11:32:54,140 --> 11:32:55,840
Do not want to be freed?

16947
11:32:56,220 --> 11:32:58,920
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

16948
11:32:59,240 --> 11:33:00,340
Free from...

16949
11:33:03,740 --> 11:33:04,400
From...

16950
11:33:04,400 --> 11:33:04,920
From...

16951
11:33:04,920 --> 11:33:05,020
From...

16952
11:33:19,250 --> 11:33:21,050
What do my players play?

16953
11:33:30,530 --> 11:33:34,150
Oh, is that... Oh, that's Mr. Shrek?

16954
11:33:34,430 --> 11:33:34,570
Oh.

16955
11:33:36,750 --> 11:33:38,570
Oh, that's Mr. Oh, fuck you.

16956
11:33:38,610 --> 11:33:39,350
I'm not going Luna.

16957
11:33:43,220 --> 11:33:47,080
Oh, it's this... This is Dive.

16958
11:33:48,640 --> 11:33:49,900
This is Dive.

16959
11:33:50,980 --> 11:33:53,400
Oh, we should have banned.

16960
11:33:53,760 --> 11:33:54,160
Ah!

16961
11:33:56,920 --> 11:33:58,400
We should have banned.

16962
11:34:03,940 --> 11:34:05,660
We should have banned.

16963
11:34:07,360 --> 11:34:08,260
Spider-Man.

16964
11:34:10,840 --> 11:34:12,280
What's the Mr. Shrek lore?

16965
11:34:13,120 --> 11:34:15,900
There was a lobby where it was full of streamers.

16966
11:34:16,020 --> 11:34:17,460
And then he said the N-word.

16967
11:34:18,060 --> 11:34:20,400
And then I was like...

16968
11:34:24,580 --> 11:34:26,680
I was like...

16969
11:34:28,940 --> 11:34:29,880
That's my lore.

16970
11:34:29,880 --> 11:34:31,220
That's all I know about him.

16971
11:34:34,220 --> 11:34:36,720
That escalated so fast.

16972
11:34:37,200 --> 11:34:40,840
That's literally the only thing I know about this guy.

16973
11:34:41,020 --> 11:34:42,000
Like, I would say it.

16974
11:34:42,200 --> 11:34:44,340
I know nothing else about him.

16975
11:34:47,860 --> 11:34:48,700
I know.

16976
11:34:48,860 --> 11:34:49,440
It's crazy.

16977
11:34:52,280 --> 11:34:52,840
Please.

16978
11:34:53,220 --> 11:34:53,700
Please.

16979
11:34:56,100 --> 11:34:57,560
Oh my god.

16980
11:34:59,700 --> 11:35:00,500
I know.

16981
11:35:00,640 --> 11:35:02,040
That like escalated pretty quickly.

16982
11:35:03,520 --> 11:35:05,420
You guys wanted the lore.

16983
11:35:05,780 --> 11:35:06,960
So I gave you the lore.

16984
11:35:08,580 --> 11:35:09,440
Jesus Christ.

16985
11:35:09,540 --> 11:35:10,620
I don't know what to do.

16986
11:35:12,100 --> 11:35:13,200
There's no odds.

16987
11:35:13,200 --> 11:35:13,800
Fight it on fire.

16988
11:35:17,440 --> 11:35:18,040
Okay.

16989
11:35:23,230 --> 11:35:24,230
Okay, he would.

16990
11:35:24,390 --> 11:35:24,530
Okay.

16991
11:35:25,810 --> 11:35:28,910
I didn't realize we had... Gomez was on Iron Fist.

16992
11:35:32,510 --> 11:35:33,990
Shrek is love.

16993
11:35:34,410 --> 11:35:36,430
Shrek is like...

16994
11:35:38,410 --> 11:35:42,390
But yeah, that's literally... that's the only thing I know about him.

16995
11:35:43,710 --> 11:35:46,590
And everyone was like... freaking out.

16996
11:35:46,770 --> 11:35:48,790
And was trying to... because like, you know...

16997
11:35:48,790 --> 11:35:50,090
Oh yeah, he didn't say it.

16998
11:35:50,350 --> 11:35:52,050
He didn't say the gamer word.

16999
11:35:52,190 --> 11:35:54,290
Like the gamer word on...

17000
11:35:55,230 --> 11:35:56,150
Oh, I don't know.

17001
11:35:56,250 --> 11:35:56,590
I'm sorry.

17002
11:35:57,690 --> 11:35:58,650
I'm sorry.

17003
11:35:58,830 --> 11:35:59,810
I can't... there's nothing I can do.

17004
11:36:00,450 --> 11:36:01,470
Oh my god.

17005
11:36:02,050 --> 11:36:06,330
He typed it and everyone was freaking out because no one knows how to...

17006
11:36:07,090 --> 11:36:09,610
No one... no one knew how to...

17007
11:36:09,610 --> 11:36:12,830
Mute... mute somebody for some... oh...

17008
11:36:12,830 --> 11:36:15,130
To... hide chat when it happened.

17009
11:36:15,490 --> 11:36:17,770
Because it was literally... like...

17010
11:36:17,770 --> 11:36:21,530
It was literally like... six streamers... in both lobbies.

17011
11:36:23,310 --> 11:36:26,330
Not even six... eight streamers in both lobbies.

17012
11:36:26,570 --> 11:36:27,910
It's fucking crazy.

17013
11:36:33,410 --> 11:36:36,090
And there were... because like... nobody expects it.

17014
11:36:36,210 --> 11:36:38,230
Like... and nobody... I mean...

17015
11:36:38,510 --> 11:36:40,790
Like... it was a high elo lobby too.

17016
11:36:40,910 --> 11:36:42,590
Nobody expects it in a high...

17017
11:36:42,590 --> 11:36:42,990
Disappear!

17018
11:36:44,350 --> 11:36:44,970
Oh my god.

17019
11:36:45,190 --> 11:36:45,830
The evil three.

17020
11:36:47,170 --> 11:36:48,750
Like... alright...

17021
11:36:48,750 --> 11:36:50,790
Like... please...

17022
11:36:50,790 --> 11:36:53,830
We need... help... behind us.

17023
11:37:04,340 --> 11:37:05,780
We need... heal.

17024
11:37:09,500 --> 11:37:12,780
Cause it was a streamer lobby so nobody expected it.

17025
11:37:13,040 --> 11:37:14,960
It was a streamer high elo lobby.

17026
11:37:15,220 --> 11:37:16,080
I wasn't in it.

17027
11:37:16,140 --> 11:37:17,500
I was watching the stream when it happened.

17028
11:37:17,860 --> 11:37:21,000
It was really a bunch of pro... like... a bunch of pro players and...

17029
11:37:21,000 --> 11:37:22,820
big marble rival streamers.

17030
11:37:22,820 --> 11:37:24,080
Ha ha ha ha!

17031
11:37:25,360 --> 11:37:26,240
Psyonic first!

17032
11:37:26,740 --> 11:37:27,660
No peers yet.

17033
11:37:41,460 --> 11:37:43,000
We really have no peers.

17034
11:37:43,400 --> 11:37:44,960
Family still comes first.

17035
11:37:45,380 --> 11:37:47,840
He does not wanna play support anymore.

17036
11:37:48,120 --> 11:37:49,380
Ha ha ha ha ha!

17037
11:37:49,540 --> 11:37:50,580
I won't blame him.

17038
11:37:51,880 --> 11:37:53,100
I won't blame him.

17039
11:37:54,140 --> 11:37:55,240
This shit sucks.

17040
11:37:55,260 --> 11:37:56,560
30 seconds before you attack.

17041
11:37:56,820 --> 11:37:57,440
Get ready!

17042
11:38:01,600 --> 11:38:02,200
Plumbing...

17043
11:38:03,360 --> 11:38:03,960
Rusted...

17044
11:38:04,900 --> 11:38:05,200
Furnace...

17045
11:38:05,920 --> 11:38:06,560
What are these...

17046
11:38:06,560 --> 11:38:08,380
Random words...

17047
11:38:08,380 --> 11:38:08,940
Repeating...

17048
11:38:08,940 --> 11:38:09,920
Ha ha ha ha!

17049
11:38:09,920 --> 11:38:09,940
Yeah!

17050
11:38:10,660 --> 11:38:11,620
Ha ha ha!

17051
11:38:12,700 --> 11:38:14,620
So I'd keep them to myself if I were you.

17052
11:38:15,080 --> 11:38:18,080
Someone implanted a code in your brain, didn't they?

17053
11:38:18,400 --> 11:38:19,020
A way to control...

17054
11:38:19,020 --> 11:38:20,740
The battle starts in five...

17055
11:38:21,420 --> 11:38:21,900
Four...

17056
11:38:21,900 --> 11:38:22,580
Three...

17057
11:38:23,160 --> 11:38:23,640
Two...

17058
11:38:23,640 --> 11:38:24,260
One!

17059
11:38:24,980 --> 11:38:26,880
That's crazy that Rai plays with him.

17060
11:38:27,000 --> 11:38:27,280
No!

17061
11:38:27,920 --> 11:38:28,500
You got it?

17062
11:38:35,120 --> 11:38:36,720
There's somebody who needs a bullet.

17063
11:38:36,940 --> 11:38:37,500
I don't know.

17064
11:38:37,580 --> 11:38:38,840
I think Rai just plays with anyone that's good.

17065
11:38:51,600 --> 11:38:52,280
Oh my god.

17066
11:38:52,400 --> 11:38:53,100
Oh my god!

17067
11:38:53,240 --> 11:38:54,020
Oh my god!

17068
11:38:54,120 --> 11:38:54,840
Oh my god!

17069
11:38:54,940 --> 11:38:55,540
Get me outta here!

17070
11:38:55,780 --> 11:38:56,640
Get me out of...

17071
11:39:03,250 --> 11:39:03,610
No...

17072
11:39:03,610 --> 11:39:03,970
Oh my god.

17073
11:39:04,050 --> 11:39:04,550
Get me outta here!

17074
11:39:08,930 --> 11:39:10,210
Oh my god.

17075
11:39:11,190 --> 11:39:12,270
That was scary.

17076
11:39:14,690 --> 11:39:23,950
I was like... It was just crazy.

17077
11:39:28,360 --> 11:39:31,260
Yeah, I don't like playing Cloak and Dagger.

17078
11:39:31,920 --> 11:39:34,960
He's such a bad character in high elo.

17079
11:39:35,900 --> 11:39:38,060
Like, it's literally just peels.

17080
11:39:39,400 --> 11:39:42,040
We just need better peels.

17081
11:39:42,260 --> 11:39:44,820
Because Cloak and Dagger is like so bad in general.

17082
11:39:45,180 --> 11:39:47,140
It's not actually like...

17083
11:39:48,440 --> 11:39:51,920
It's not actually like a solution to the problem.

17084
11:39:52,880 --> 11:40:00,630
In general, it's just... Oh my god.

17085
11:40:03,130 --> 11:40:04,910
Jesus Christ.

17086
11:40:14,980 --> 11:40:16,620
She's just bad.

17087
11:40:17,260 --> 11:40:21,100
She's not great in high elo.

17088
11:40:21,900 --> 11:40:24,500
I don't like playing here in that elo in general.

17089
11:40:25,180 --> 11:40:25,640
Because of it.

17090
11:40:30,850 --> 11:40:31,410
Alright.

17091
11:40:33,930 --> 11:40:35,610
I literally can't do anything.

17092
11:40:39,150 --> 11:40:40,070
Oh my god.

17093
11:40:40,170 --> 11:40:41,270
We literally can't move.

17094
11:40:42,410 --> 11:40:44,470
I... I can't move anywhere.

17095
11:40:46,430 --> 11:40:46,990
Blair.

17096
11:40:48,250 --> 11:40:50,090
I... I don't know what to do.

17097
11:40:56,180 --> 11:40:56,940
You know I'm here.

17098
11:40:59,100 --> 11:41:00,100
Get back in here.

17099
11:41:00,440 --> 11:41:00,880
Captain.

17100
11:41:01,560 --> 11:41:02,800
We died and get there.

17101
11:41:06,320 --> 11:41:07,740
Get back in here, Captain.

17102
11:41:11,520 --> 11:41:13,280
Guys, we didn't get our one game.

17103
11:41:18,280 --> 11:41:19,920
We didn't get her.

17104
11:41:19,920 --> 11:41:19,940
We didn't get her.

17105
11:41:23,940 --> 11:41:24,500
Well...

17106
11:41:25,200 --> 11:41:26,300
Do I do it?

17107
11:41:26,480 --> 11:41:28,120
Do I see you guys on Twitch?

17108
11:41:28,600 --> 11:41:29,860
Do I see...

17109
11:41:30,800 --> 11:41:32,740
Looks like we're moving to Twitch.

17110
11:41:32,740 --> 11:41:33,020
Twitch.

17111
11:41:33,380 --> 11:41:34,920
I'll see you guys there.

17112
11:41:35,580 --> 11:41:38,720
But for those who are tired already...

17113
11:41:39,940 --> 11:41:42,280
Thank you everybody for watching today.

17114
11:41:42,560 --> 11:41:43,680
I had a really fun tournament.

17115
11:41:44,020 --> 11:41:45,000
I had a really great experience.

17116
11:41:45,000 --> 11:41:46,500
I'm moving over to Twitch now.

17117
11:41:50,100 --> 11:41:52,800
I'm moving over to Twitch to continue the grind.

17118
11:41:52,800 --> 11:41:57,460
And as always everybody, stay hydrated, pause to check you up and move around to get that blood flowing.

17119
11:41:57,920 --> 11:41:59,580
And you stay up for me, head to bed.

17120
11:41:59,620 --> 11:42:00,900
Cause you deserve it.

17121
11:42:01,040 --> 11:42:02,200
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

17122
11:42:02,700 --> 11:42:03,500
Bye guys!

17123
11:42:04,100 --> 11:42:04,500
Bye!

17124
11:42:05,480 --> 11:42:08,060
If you want to watch more, check me out on Twitch!

17125
11:42:08,060 --> 11:42:08,500
Twitch!

17126
11:42:08,620 --> 11:42:10,060
Wait, I'll just post my Twitch real quick.

17127
11:42:10,340 --> 11:42:10,900
Hee hee ya.

17128
11:42:11,340 --> 11:42:11,960
Hee hee ya.

17129
11:42:12,560 --> 11:42:12,860
Okay.

17130
11:42:13,200 --> 11:42:13,720
Twitch.

17131
11:42:14,340 --> 11:42:14,880
Hee hee ya.

17132
11:42:14,980 --> 11:42:15,560
Okay, here we go.

17133
11:42:15,920 --> 11:42:16,820
I'm moving over.

17134
11:42:17,940 --> 11:42:19,940
I'm just moving platforms right now.

17135
11:42:21,620 --> 11:42:23,700
Cause our bod is gonna die if I don't.

17136
11:42:23,960 --> 11:42:24,520
Ha ha ha!

17137
11:42:24,960 --> 11:42:26,580
I'll see you guys soon everyone!

17138
11:42:26,940 --> 11:42:27,600
Bye guys!

17139
11:42:27,980 --> 11:42:28,500
Bye!

17140
11:42:30,360 --> 11:42:30,880
Wow!
