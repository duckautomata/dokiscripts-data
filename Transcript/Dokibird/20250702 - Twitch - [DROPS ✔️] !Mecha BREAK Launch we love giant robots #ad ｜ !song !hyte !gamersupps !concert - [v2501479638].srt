1
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,240
I, whoa, where am I?

2
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,040
I don't know, that's awkward.

3
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,020
Oh, there I am.

4
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,520
Oh, man, maybe not a white shirt.

5
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Give me a sec.

6
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,020
Let me, let me change shirts real quick.

7
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,200
I realize, maybe, maybe not a white shirt.

8
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,600
So, I just gotta change my shirt color.

9
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,520
Gotta change shirts real quick, guys.

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,660
Gotta change my shirt.

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,260
Alright, I'm here for real.

12
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,300
Hello, everybody.

13
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,480
Hello, hello.

14
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,580
Today, we are gonna be here.

15
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,280
We're gonna be here to check out Mecha Break.

16
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,100
Yes, it is.

17
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,420
It's launch time.

18
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,440
It's launch day for Mecha Break.

19
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,220
Because the servers are basically starting, like, started like three minutes ago.

20
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,200
So, yes, we're gonna be going in blind.

21
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,680
I've heard a lot about this game.

22
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,080
I've heard a lot about Mecha Break.

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,700
I remember seeing a lot of trailers for it.

24
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,100
We love giant robots.

25
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,840
You love giant robots.

26
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,500
We love giant robots.

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,480
We love giant robots.

28
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,400
You love giant robots.

29
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,940
Real throwback.

30
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,180
But yes, it is the official launch date for Mecha Break.

31
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,100
So, for those who don't know, I'm actually sponsored right now.

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,540
So, huge shout out and thank you to amazing CSUN Games for sponsoring the stream.

33
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,040
And... I was actually planning on playing this game anyway.

34
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,360
So, thank you!

35
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,400
Now I get paid to play the game that I was originally going to play anyway.

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,920
So, yippee!

37
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,440
Thanks, devs!

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,160
Anyway, for those who don't know, it is...

39
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,240
free to play.

40
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,620
So, you can actually download the game right now.

41
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:05,580
If you click on the link that's pinned in chat or exclamation point Mecha, you can actually download the game right now because it is free to play.

42
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,520
For those who don't know what this game is about, it is a third-person shooter and it has three different modes.

43
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,620
So, there is a hero shooter mode.

44
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,700
So, it's a 6v6 hero shooter mode.

45
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,440
There is 3v3 deathmatch and there is called Mashmack.

46
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,140
So, it's basically... there is also an extraction...

47
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,940
extraction shooter in there.

48
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,860
So, there's three different game modes.

49
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,060
If you can download it right now, maybe you'll get into my lobby, you know?

50
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,900
So, there's apparently 15 mechs you can choose and they're called Strikers and each of them have like...

51
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,920
because it is a hero shooter.

52
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,500
They each have their unique, you know, there's like unique like roles there.

53
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,460
There's like Brawler, which I assume is Tank, Sniper for DPS, and Support for, you know, being a support.

54
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,260
I don't even remember I'm sponsored.

55
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,220
I can't... I can't say the other word.

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,720
Apparently, it's a very, very fast game.

57
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,160
I didn't get a chance to try out the beta.

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,460
So, like I said, this is my first time trying this game out.

59
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,980
And I'm going in blind, basically.

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,460
For those who don't know, because I am sponsored by Mecha Break, I do have Twitch drops.

61
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,900
So, yes, let me pull it out right now.

62
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,040
By watching... Whoa, that's a big picture.

63
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,500
By watching this stream, you can have... Oh, whoa.

64
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,900
You can have... Whoa.

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,720
Sorry, let me... You can be basically a Mecha Catgirl, I assume?

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,900
DragonField, thank you for the tier one subs.

67
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,880
Thank you, thank you.

68
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:52,940
So, yes, because I am one of the people sponsored to stream Mecha Break at the moment, I am eligible for Twitch drops.

69
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,580
So, watching this stream will grant you Twitch drops.

70
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
So, I don't remember exactly how many hours you have to watch.

71
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,480
But I will be streaming at least two hours today.

72
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,340
So, it will build towards the counter of getting these accessories for free.

73
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,480
So, like I said, you should again, two amazing season games for the sponsor.

74
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,780
I really appreciate it for, you know, inviting me to check out your game.

75
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,080
It seems really fun.

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,620
I heard a lot of people talk a lot of stuff about this game.

77
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,980
So, I'm super excited to try it out.

78
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,580
But yes, it is free to play, guys.

79
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,780
We love free stuff.

80
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,540
And it is free to play.

81
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,380
Alright, let me boot up that game.

82
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,680
I love giant robots.

83
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Chicks love giant robots.

84
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,220
You love giant robots.

85
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,220
It just reminded me of that.

86
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,740
It actually reminded me of that song when it was...

87
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,320
Woo!

88
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:47,860
Free!

89
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,500
I love free stuff!

90
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,580
Yippee!

91
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,080
And apparently, you can like...

92
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,260
It's like apparently incredibly fast too.

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,300
So, it's very fast-paced.

94
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:58,860
Which I like.

95
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,400
I like fast-paced shooters in general.

96
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,880
So, I'm looking forward to that.

97
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,820
We dig giant robots.

98
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,580
You dig...

99
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm sorry, that sounds like heavily stuck in my head right now.

100
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,580
But those who are wondering why I'm like...

101
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,760
Uh...

102
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,060
Uh...

103
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,580
Why...

104
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,680
Wait, is this like...

105
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,380
Okay, I don't know if this is the right one.

106
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,600
Okay, usually it's compiling shaders at that point.

107
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,760
Okay, let me...

108
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,940
I guess I close this.

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,120
And then...

110
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,060
I gotta make sure I have the right thing on.

111
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,580
Bum, bum.

112
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,300
Okay, I'm compiling shaders.

113
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:31,800
Ooh.

114
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,180
Is it...

115
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,760
Window?

116
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,140
Is it window capture?

117
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,760
Or...

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,060
Can it be game capture?

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,880
Okay, we'll find out.

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,340
I'm gonna find out if we can window capture or game capture this.

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Um...

122
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,080
It's a shooter, but it has fighting game elements.

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,880
Melee has...

124
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,120
Ooh!

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,860
Ooh, that's interesting.

126
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:49,800
Um...

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,880
I can't wait to try out all...

128
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm gonna try out all the classes.

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,760
Cause there's like what?

130
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,080
15 distinct classes to choose from?

131
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,460
That's a lot of like different types to like play around with.

132
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,740
So that's gonna be really fun.

133
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,760
Um...

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,540
I'm just waiting.

135
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,020
It's compiling shaders right now.

136
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,320
I don't know if I can game capture this.

137
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
Let me try window capture just in case.

138
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,560
Uh...

139
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,320
Mecha break.

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, yeah.

141
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,170
I think I can...

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,820
Okay, I'm window capturing this.

143
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,820
Yeah, I have to window capture this.

144
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,060
I'm pretty sure.

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,820
Okay, here we go.

146
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,660
Uh...

147
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,640
No, there's three game modes.

148
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,980
There's the hero shooter mode.

149
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,420
There's the 6v6 hero shooter.

150
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
There's the...

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Uh...

152
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,020
3v3 deathmatch.

153
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,620
And then there's the extraction mode called mesh mac.

154
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,940
So, um...

155
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,340
That one is the extraction game mode.

156
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,020
So it's basically, you know, pick your...

157
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,840
Pick your flavor.

158
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,640
You know?

159
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,820
Uh...

160
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,320
Boy, thank you for the 200 bitties.

161
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,620
Thank you.

162
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,320
Thank you.

163
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,460
James, thank you for the 100 bitties.

164
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,780
Thank you.

165
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,320
Thank you.

166
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,220
The walking animation really emphasized on...

167
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,140
But the male characters have no cake.

168
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,160
Poor guys.

169
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:02,280
Also, for those who don't know, Mecha break is now available on Steam, Xbox series, and Windows PC via the Xbox app.

170
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,700
And there's gonna be like...

171
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:03,940
Uh...

172
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,800
There's gonna be more...

173
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,960
It's gonna come up on more platforms.

174
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,940
But right now, you can obviously try it right now on Xbox and Steam.

175
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,960
And like I said, it is free to play!

176
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,640
Yippee!

177
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,400
Yeah, free to play!

178
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:15,800
Yay!

179
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,400
And I think there's like...

180
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,520
On day one...

181
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,740
Oh yeah!

182
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,380
Uh...

183
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,460
Almost forgot to mention...

184
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,000
For the first day, there's 12 free strikers.

185
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
So you can pick from 12 different characters for free on the first day.

186
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,060
So...

187
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,560
Yay!

188
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,480
Lunchtime!

189
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
I've seen so many trailers about this game.

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,640
My game crashed.

191
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,800
Okay.

192
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,640
Okay.

193
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,460
I love the...

194
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,840
Love the timing of that.

195
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,160
That was...

196
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,100
That was good timing.

197
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,140
I was like...

198
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,600
Yippee!

199
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,980
Okay.

200
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,580
So this...

201
00:09:59,580 --> 00:09:59,720
Okay.

202
00:09:59,840 --> 00:09:59,960
Wait.

203
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,680
Give me a sec.

204
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,840
I gotta make sure...

205
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,440
Discard.

206
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,120
I gotta make sure it's on the right one.

207
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:07,980
Okay.

208
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,760
It is.

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,120
Alright.

210
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,520
Nice.

211
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:09,880
Alright.

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,320
I have...

213
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,640
Don't tell them I...

214
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,520
I didn't read the rules.

215
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,220
Don't tell them that.

216
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:16,880
Hello.

217
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,820
Welcome to Shadow.

218
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,480
Mecha Break will officially launch worldwide.

219
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,580
What?

220
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,480
That's right now!

221
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,940
That's...

222
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,400
Today!

223
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,820
That's...

224
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,720
11 minutes ago!

225
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,870
Oh, whoa.

226
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,370
It's loud.

227
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,430
Oh, it's loud.

228
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:35,730
Okay.

229
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,780
Oh, hello.

230
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,780
Mecha Break.

231
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,080
Alright.

232
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
Guys, don't snitch on me, alright?

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,740
Please enter your code name.

234
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,620
I swear to God.

235
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,980
Someone already took DokiBird.

236
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,200
I swear to...

237
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,700
I swear to fucking God.

238
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,080
Oh shit.

239
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,580
Thank God.

240
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:55,880
Okay.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,520
I was gonna say.

242
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,440
I swear to God.

243
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,140
Is someone already...

244
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,560
I literally just got here.

245
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,580
I was gonna...

246
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,320
Identify Life is not a joke, guys.

247
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:07,820
Okay.

248
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,580
I gotta change the skin.

249
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,560
Oh.

250
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,840
Oh, okay.

251
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,700
Alright.

252
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,440
We'll do that.

253
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, wait.

254
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,800
There's more edits?

255
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,060
Oh my God!

256
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,580
Sorry.

257
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,500
We're gonna be here for a bit.

258
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,800
No.

259
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,500
If I'm too smooth, it looks like I have too much oil.

260
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,760
Oh my God.

261
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,080
We get to have so much customization.

262
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,180
Ooh.

263
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,060
She fine.

264
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,480
Well, this is the real game right now.

265
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,460
Oh no.

266
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,200
Oh no.

267
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,780
They can't do this to me.

268
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,780
They can't...

269
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,360
They can't do this to me.

270
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,240
I'm gonna be stuck here for so long.

271
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,080
Alright.

272
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,220
Alright.

273
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,940
Face shape.

274
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,840
Whoa.

275
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,880
Okay.

276
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,460
Come on.

277
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,200
Come on, girl.

278
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,720
Okay.

279
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,420
I need to see your face shape.

280
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,560
I need to figure out what shape I want you to be.

281
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,200
Uh...

282
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,140
I mean, can I actually make myself...

283
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,960
Oh my God.

284
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,440
No.

285
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,080
No.

286
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,560
No.

287
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't do this.

288
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,720
No!

289
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,160
Don't do this to me!

290
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,520
Guys, I can't.

291
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,140
I can't.

292
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,040
We're gonna use up the entire two hours.

293
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,940
Two hours later.

294
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,840
Okay.

295
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,340
Alright.

296
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,480
What do I want my eye shape to be like?

297
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:19,960
Ooh.

298
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,280
Let's make her eye...

299
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,640
Let's do...

300
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,820
Oh my God.

301
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,640
It's a little...

302
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,000
Too big.

303
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,520
I was gonna say it so I could see better.

304
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,700
I can't edit the colors.

305
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,800
Oh my God.

306
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,980
Eyelid.

307
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,160
Upper eyelid.

308
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,140
Lower eyelid.

309
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,760
Brow eyelid.

310
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:40,860
No.

311
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,060
Oh my God.

312
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,860
It's so tempting.

313
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,260
You don't understand.

314
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,580
It's so tempting.

315
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,660
Okay.

316
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,720
I think the lips are a little too big though.

317
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,560
I'm not...

318
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,320
I don't like that.

319
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh my God.

320
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,260
Okay.

321
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,080
We're gonna fix the lips a little bit.

322
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,540
It's a little too big for my taste.

323
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,700
Okay.

324
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,500
There you go.

325
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,400
There you go.

326
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,700
Alright.

327
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,460
I know she looks very normal.

328
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,060
Okay.

329
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,840
Fuck.

330
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,500
What am I doing?

331
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,000
Why am I making her so normal?

332
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,900
What am I doing?

333
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,960
Why is she...

334
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,220
Oh.

335
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,660
Oh.

336
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,240
Wait.

337
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,720
That's me.

338
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,640
Okay.

339
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:15,960
Wait.

340
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,040
I can't help it.

341
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,920
I can't help it.

342
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,680
I just want her to look pretty.

343
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,440
Haha.

344
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,120
I just...

345
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,700
I just want her to...

346
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,140
I want her to look nice.

347
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,020
I'm gonna be...

348
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,480
Okay, I just want her to look nice!

349
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,600
Hahaha.

350
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:34,900
Okay.

351
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,600
Ohh.

352
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:35,920
Okay.

353
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,740
Let's do that.

354
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,260
And then...

355
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,740
Iris.

356
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,340
Okay.

357
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay, we'll just make me...

358
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,580
Oh, but she looks so uncanny with green eyes.

359
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:44,660
Nice.

360
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,440
She looks so... Oh my god.

361
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh my god, there's cat eyes too.

362
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,700
Okay, she looks really uncanny with green eyes.

363
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,800
Okay.

364
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh my god, there's lip makeup too.

365
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,160
Oh, that's cute.

366
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,060
Oh, that is so cute.

367
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,420
Okay.

368
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
And I realized we're gonna be in a mech anyway.

369
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,620
So...

370
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,040
Omni, thank you for the 150s.

371
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,900
Thank you, thank you.

372
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,140
Okay.

373
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,080
Okay.

374
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,060
The worst part is that... I'm gonna be in a mech anyway.

375
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,900
So... I'm not gonna see her.

376
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,700
I'm not even gonna see her.

377
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,700
Wait, okay.

378
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,280
Nice.

379
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:25,920
Alright.

380
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,820
That's the worst part.

381
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,260
I want her to look cute.

382
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,840
Okay, let's see.

383
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
I just want her to be cute.

384
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,480
Dude, is that too much to ask for?

385
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,320
I... There we go.

386
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,200
Um... Oh, I should make it more of... Okay, no.

387
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,080
I don't think they have, like, my yellow.

388
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,360
To be fair.

389
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm... Oh, wait.

390
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,820
Unless I put it more... Okay, there you go.

391
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,320
Alright.

392
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,060
There you go.

393
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,740
Nice.

394
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,700
Alright.

395
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,620
There.

396
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,420
Yeah.

397
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,720
God... Exactly.

398
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,200
God be fabulous.

399
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,600
While... While... Ooh, I can do... Do the length.

400
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,600
Ooh, okay.

401
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,120
We're gonna have to fix that hair color.

402
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,360
I'm sorry.

403
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,740
I'm sorry.

404
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:10,940
I'm sorry.

405
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm sorry.

406
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,560
I have to do this.

407
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,320
Okay.

408
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,700
And then... Okay.

409
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,220
We don't want... What's the hair?

410
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,720
Hair color.

411
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,720
Yeah.

412
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,980
Okay.

413
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,480
There you go.

414
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,280
There you go.

415
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,020
That's more normal.

416
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,580
Alright.

417
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,240
There you go.

418
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,860
We're fine.

419
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:27,940
Alright.

420
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,700
Alright.

421
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,140
Nice.

422
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,780
Okay.

423
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,720
That's good.

424
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,540
Alright.

425
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,060
Body.

426
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,640
Okay.

427
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,110
Okay.

428
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,110
Guys.

429
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,750
No comment.

430
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,550
No comment.

431
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,450
No comment.

432
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:17,450
No.

433
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:17,450
Stop.

434
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,630
No comment.

435
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,570
No comment.

436
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,370
No comment.

437
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,670
I'm not taking any questions.

438
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,230
I'm...

439
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,570
No interviews.

440
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,670
I once read in a book... You gotta get used to... Kill your sympathy.

441
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,290
So your only power gets things, sadly.

442
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,990
Oh my... Trash doesn't clean itself.

443
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,190
The world is far from peaceful.

444
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,090
Did someone say it?

445
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,470
I hope the love and passion...

446
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:47,850
Okay.

447
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,150
I like this one.

448
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,310
Wait.

449
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,250
Can we view it?

450
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,590
Wait.

451
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,350
I can't...

452
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,790
Be... I wanna be this.

453
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,210
No!

454
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,770
No!

455
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,250
To partake!

456
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:57,630
Oh!

457
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,190
Okay.

458
00:16:59,330 --> 00:16:59,670
No.

459
00:16:59,770 --> 00:16:59,870
No.

460
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,210
You're right.

461
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,390
No.

462
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:00,610
Delta.

463
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:00,810
Delta.

464
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,390
I all...

465
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,490
I thought she was gonna say that too.

466
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:03,770
Delta.

467
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,850
I legitimately thought she was gonna say that.

468
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,350
Alright.

469
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:08,690
Bro.

470
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,890
I wanna be this too!

471
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,010
Can I...

472
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,090
It doesn't let me...

473
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,590
I can only apply it!

474
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,330
I can only view it!

475
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,770
How do I be too?

476
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,450
Okay.

477
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,190
Let's try...

478
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,530
Special landing force!

479
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,810
Combat ready!

480
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,230
Alright.

481
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,430
Uh...

482
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,090
Rookie mode.

483
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,350
Okay.

484
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,150
We need to do rookie because I don't...

485
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,570
I feel like we gotta learn.

486
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:37,950
Alright.

487
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:38,750
Wait.

488
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,510
Actually...

489
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,170
Are we done?

490
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,310
Yeah.

491
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:42,770
We're done.

492
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,290
Alright.

493
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,290
Rookie mode.

494
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,470
Standard.

495
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,590
Optional.

496
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,770
Marshmint.

497
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,190
I guess this is the...

498
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,390
Wait.

499
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,650
What's the difference between standard and optional?

500
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,430
Uh...

501
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:57,810
Uh...

502
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,330
Oh, better...

503
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,290
What is between like...

504
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,470
Optional and the standard?

505
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,020
Oh, I should...

506
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,500
Oh, mods.

507
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,800
Mods.

508
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,260
Is my mod...

509
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,560
Oh, wait.

510
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:10,760
Wait.

511
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,980
Is my sound guy here?

512
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,080
Sorry.

513
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,360
I forgot to do it.

514
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:14,920
Uh...

515
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,420
Sound...

516
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,160
Sound people.

517
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Sound people.

518
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,140
Oh, yeah.

519
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,760
There you go.

520
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,540
There's sound people.

521
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:19,860
Okay.

522
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,400
Bring the game up a little bit.

523
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:21,740
Okay.

524
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,100
Nice.

525
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,320
All right.

526
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,820
Give me a sec.

527
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,340
Let me do that real quick.

528
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,280
Uh...

529
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,480
Bring the game up a little...

530
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,620
Okay.

531
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,180
Bring the game up a little bit.

532
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:36,740
Um...

533
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,920
Standard is the full tutorial?

534
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,320
Okay.

535
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,260
We'll just do standard then.

536
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,140
Wait.

537
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,100
No, I can't do standard.

538
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,380
Okay.

539
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,080
We have to do option.

540
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,420
Never mind.

541
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,260
I can only do option though, I think.

542
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,620
Oh, wait.

543
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,320
Or maybe...

544
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,160
Oh, no.

545
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Oh, it's already applied.

546
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:51,900
Okay.

547
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,180
Nice.

548
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,460
All right.

549
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,420
Let me know if this sounds better.

550
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,900
Oh, that's me.

551
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,420
Guys.

552
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,740
Guess which one's the main character?

553
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,300
Guess which one is it?

554
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,600
Also, mods.

555
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,260
If you can like add the drops...

556
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,000
If you can add...

557
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,900
Oh, wait.

558
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,120
Edit my mecha...

559
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,840
Mecha command.

560
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,100
And then...

561
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,840
Oh, still a bit quiet.

562
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,220
Okay.

563
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,140
Don't worry.

564
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,600
I'll fix it.

565
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,600
Oh, I can't fix it yet.

566
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,820
Wait until I land on Earth.

567
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,680
Then I can fix it.

568
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,760
Oh, no.

569
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,820
Don't worry.

570
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,380
I live.

571
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,100
Whoa.

572
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,860
I know where all the oxygen is going.

573
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,940
Oh, my God.

574
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,420
Are they okay?

575
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,020
You think they're okay?

576
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,080
Oh, silly.

577
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,220
Them sleeping in space.

578
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,040
Come on, guys.

579
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,640
Get up.

580
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,740
Silly.

581
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,880
Silly, guys.

582
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,660
Come on.

583
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,120
Stop sleeping in space.

584
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,880
They'll be okay.

585
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,820
Silly fight.

586
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,840
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

587
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,200
Thank you.

588
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,740
Thank you.

589
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,040
Oh, I forgot to do one.

590
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,380
All right.

591
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,220
Yeah.

592
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,700
What a bunch of slackers.

593
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,200
All right.

594
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,760
Let me...

595
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,280
I knew...

596
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,620
Okay.

597
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,740
144 hurt.

598
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,060
144 frames.

599
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,420
All right.

600
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,600
And then...

601
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,280
You know what?

602
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,780
Fuck it.

603
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,340
It's fine.

604
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,500
It's fine.

605
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,060
We might be under attack, but they'll be okay.

606
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh, wait.

607
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,800
There's no timer.

608
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,840
We should be fine.

609
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,980
Guys, we're fine.

610
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,920
There's no timer.

611
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,880
Okay.

612
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,140
Wait.

613
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,540
Where's the sensitivity, though?

614
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,440
Okay.

615
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,560
There's the T switch.

616
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,280
Oh, there we go.

617
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:42,560
Okay.

618
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,700
I need to turn it down.

619
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,140
General sensitivity.

620
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,880
I wonder if there's like a...

621
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,700
It's okay.

622
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,460
This is more important, guys.

623
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,240
Guys, I'm going to check.

624
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,320
Actually, I'm going to check if there's a sense converter yet.

625
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,980
There might be, actually.

626
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,040
Let me double check.

627
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,500
It might...

628
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,980
Oh, my God.

629
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,740
There's already a...

630
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,040
Nice.

631
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,780
There's already a sense converter for mecha break.

632
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,340
That's good.

633
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,400
All right.

634
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,700
Guys, do you guys remember what my sense was?

635
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,680
Because I don't.

636
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Okay.

637
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,120
It is 0.

638
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,140
Okay.

639
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,840
I assume my sense was...

640
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,000
I think my sense is 1.8.

641
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,900
So, it should be 0.4 then.

642
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,640
Yeah.

643
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,440
0.4.

644
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,060
Oh, there you go.

645
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,540
1.8.

646
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:26,880
There you go.

647
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,520
Thank you, guys.

648
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,940
You know what?

649
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,940
That's actually convenient.

650
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,320
Okay.

651
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,000
Nice.

652
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,960
Thanks, guys.

653
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,700
Yippee!

654
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,900
Oh, my God!

655
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,680
Kumbi, thank you for the 6...

656
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:39,900
Nice.

657
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,640
Thank you for the 69 subs.

658
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,300
Thank you.

659
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,020
Thank you.

660
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,540
I really...

661
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,700
Thank you so much.

662
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,740
Oh, my God.

663
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,440
Thank you.

664
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,720
Okay.

665
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,800
Let me make sure the audio...

666
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,820
Bring up just a little bit more.

667
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,300
Okay.

668
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,860
All right.

669
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,420
There you go.

670
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,400
Okay.

671
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,420
Let's try it.

672
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,020
Nice.

673
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,640
Thank you.

674
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,340
Thank you again!

675
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,860
I really appreciate it.

676
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,980
Woo!

677
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,820
Shift and boost.

678
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,260
Okay.

679
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,660
Oh, yeah.

680
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,320
You can tell it's super fast-paced for that.

681
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,380
All right.

682
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,700
Nice.

683
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:10,780
Nice.

684
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,840
Hello!

685
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,160
Oh, my God.

686
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,440
That's a giant robot.

687
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,360
That's a giant mecha right there.

688
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,220
All right.

689
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,620
Space is jump.

690
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,740
And then air boost.

691
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,200
Oh, okay.

692
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,120
So, I can fly while jumping.

693
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:29,620
Okay.

694
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,380
Is there, like, a...

695
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,540
Okay.

696
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,280
There is energy.

697
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,320
So, my right-hand side is the energy.

698
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,360
Okay.

699
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,140
How do I...

700
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,860
Oh, my God.

701
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,900
I was gonna say, where is my gun?

702
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,400
Okay.

703
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,400
Left-click is the sword comp...

704
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,640
Oh.

705
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,300
Okay.

706
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,160
Okay.

707
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,580
That's...

708
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,660
Okay.

709
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,180
This is...

710
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,100
Right-click is melee.

711
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,600
Okay.

712
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,140
I get it.

713
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,940
Right-click is melee.

714
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,880
Yeah.

715
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,480
It's super fast.

716
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,380
I can tell, like, it's a super fast game.

717
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,700
Okay.

718
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,220
So, I can hold...

719
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,620
Oh, my God.

720
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,440
This is so fast.

721
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,240
Oh.

722
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:12,720
Oh.

723
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,380
Okay.

724
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,080
Oh, my God.

725
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,520
Oh, my...

726
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,020
I'm gonna get absolutely destroyed.

727
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,960
In multiplayer.

728
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
In multiplayer.

729
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Okay.

730
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,520
No.

731
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,900
I'm definitely gonna get destroyed.

732
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
In multiplayer.

733
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,740
Like...

734
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,940
Okay.

735
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,060
Now it's self-destruct.

736
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,240
See?

737
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,040
I told you guys.

738
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm fine.

739
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,780
I don't have to worry about self-destruct.

740
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,620
I feel like...

741
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,440
I feel like I'm gonna get destroyed.

742
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,940
It's gonna be so fast.

743
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,140
Oh, my God.

744
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:49,840
Which one's...

745
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:49,960
Okay.

746
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,440
That's me.

747
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,200
Okay.

748
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,860
Neutralize.

749
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,200
Enemy.

750
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,880
Left-click.

751
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,420
Energy.

752
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,220
Move.

753
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:54,700
Camera.

754
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,080
Oh.

755
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,580
I can, like, zoom in and out.

756
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,400
Okay.

757
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,580
Woo!

758
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,180
Woo!

759
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,400
Woo!

760
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,040
Okay.

761
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,580
Sorry.

762
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,280
That was my bad.

763
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,880
That's fine.

764
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,620
Okay.

765
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,820
So, I can, like, move it back and forth.

766
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,060
That was my bad.

767
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,520
I...

768
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,300
I literally walked into it.

769
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,740
So, I have to hold it.

770
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,180
Okay.

771
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,560
I'm fine.

772
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm so healthy.

773
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,680
Okay.

774
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,360
Get down from there.

775
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,620
Only I can be in space.

776
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,820
Ba-bum-bum.

777
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,620
Ba-bum-bum.

778
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,760
Ba-bum-bum.

779
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,460
Oh, my God.

780
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,520
Where do I go?

781
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,840
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

782
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,720
Run!

783
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,460
He...

784
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,060
How do

785
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,240
I...

786
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay.

787
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,320
Ba-bum.

788
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,280
Like, he owns space.

789
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,320
Okay.

790
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,180
So, I'm charging it fully up.

791
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

792
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Oh my god.

793
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,180
Don't worry, he'll eventually die.

794
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,080
Wait, no, I just got this mech!

795
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,500
What do you mean?

796
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,400
Full W?

797
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,840
Am I... Am I doing it?

798
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,520
Oh, I am.

799
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,440
I couldn't tell.

800
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,160
It was still so fast.

801
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,220
Wait, three?

802
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,360
What's this?

803
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,360
Oh!

804
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,360
Oh my god!

805
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,340
I just got, like, more armor!

806
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,840
What's going on?

807
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,400
I feel like I was, like, just brought out of here.

808
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,800
Out of retirement, you're like, we need you back from retirement!

809
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,480
And I'm like, where am I?

810
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,880
Okay, get him out of here.

811
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,240
I don't like that my right click is just a shield, though.

812
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,860
I'm not here to defend.

813
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,640
Ooh!

814
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,440
Hello.

815
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,500
See that shield?

816
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,240
Oh my god, wait.

817
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,980
Okay, give me a sec.

818
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,300
Don't worry, I'm charging it up.

819
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,780
You can't- you'll die eventually.

820
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,600
Oh my god.

821
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,500
I'm curious how, like, the heroes- the different classes play.

822
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:24,580
Okay.

823
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
Like, what class this is.

824
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,040
Okay, I need to, like, charge this up.

825
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,060
And just, like, keep charging infinitely.

826
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,760
Phew!

827
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh, I can swap weapons?

828
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,740
Oh!

829
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,720
And bypass enemy fluid armor and cause significant damage.

830
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,180
Oh, I got the halberd!

831
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,080
Okay, I like that more.

832
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,320
What the fuck?

833
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,400
I like- Okay, not gonna lie.

834
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,980
That shit is much- that shit is cooler.

835
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,960
Oh!

836
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,760
What?

837
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,020
What did I do?

838
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,880
What?

839
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,800
What?

840
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,500
I did not even- I don't- What did I do?

841
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,350
What?

842
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,550
What happened?

843
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,590
Okay.

844
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,950
I'm gonna use- I like the melee more.

845
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,970
I think the melee is more fun.

846
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:28,990
That's me.

847
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,410
I bring peace by killing.

848
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,890
Yeah, I think the melee is- Is fucking sick.

849
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,750
Not gonna lie.

850
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,070
I'll get those bastards.

851
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,790
That's right!

852
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,190
Ooh!

853
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,210
That's right!

854
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:44,730
Ooh!

855
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,210
Can't find me!

856
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,530
Cause I- Okay, I need super high sense for this game.

857
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,250
Honestly.

858
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,710
I think this game requires insane sense.

859
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,310
Okay, nice.

860
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,570
Ooh!

861
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,110
Ooh!

862
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,610
That's right!

863
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,250
What you gonna do now?

864
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,830
Boom!

865
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,190
Yeah, I definitely need high sense for this game because of how fast-paced this is.

866
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,870
That's right!

867
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:16,710
Oh, wait.

868
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,330
Am I hurt?

869
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:17,650
No.

870
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,130
Oh!

871
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:18,910
This is tutorial!

872
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,410
I'll never be hurt!

873
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,390
They won't let me die!

874
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,510
I'm tutorialing!

875
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,430
I'm tutorialing!

876
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,440
Yeah, I'm gonna turn up my sense.

877
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,860
I- I cannot play this with no sense.

878
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,760
Alright.

879
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,000
How much shield do I get?

880
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,520
That's right!

881
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
You can't kill me!

882
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,460
Ha ha ha!

883
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,700
Look at my HP!

884
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
It's forever full!

885
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,900
Wait, I don't even need a dodge.

886
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,640
What the heck?

887
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,780
What the fuck?

888
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,900
Let me just- I actually- Ha ha ha!

889
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,040
That's right- Oh, never mind.

890
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,440
Here.

891
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,480
Let me just stand in front of you.

892
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,960
I don't- That's right!

893
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,580
My HP is full forever!

894
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,960
Okay, let me put the sensitivity super high.

895
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,860
I can't.

896
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,040
I can't.

897
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,680
I cannot- Whoa.

898
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,240
I cannot play this game with low sense.

899
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,700
That's good to know, though.

900
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,660
That's good to know that this game requires high sense.

901
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,780
Oh, yeah.

902
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,280
When there's, like, a hundred effects going on.

903
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,620
Yeah!

904
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,420
I'm literally playing on, like, cinematic mode.

905
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,090
Wait, I have- Oh, my God.

906
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,070
That was my armor.

907
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,830
Oh, wait.

908
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,250
Maybe I should have dodged.

909
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,110
Take this thing down.

910
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,870
Okay.

911
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,370
Oh, hey.

912
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,190
There's my friends.

913
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,490
Hurricane and, uh, Lumaine.

914
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,210
That thing that just entered the atmosphere.

915
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,110
Is it friendly?

916
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,650
I don't know.

917
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,070
It's fighting back.

918
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,730
I wonder if it's friendly.

919
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,170
Ha ha ha ha!

920
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,470
He's fighting back!

921
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,330
Friend?

922
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,230
Ha ha ha ha!

923
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,230
Maybe friend.

924
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,230
Who knows?

925
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,770
Oh, my- Okay, I'm okay.

926
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,250
I'm okay.

927
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:10,830
I'm okay.

928
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,410
I'm okay.

929
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,090
Okay.

930
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,170
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

931
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,530
Is it fr- It looks pretty friendly.

932
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,350
Ha ha ha!

933
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,270
Wait!

934
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,170
Wait, guys!

935
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,050
Guys!

936
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,910
What the- What the fuck?!

937
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,450
Guys!

938
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,190
I'm- Okay, that's cool.

939
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,030
That's fine.

940
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,670
We can- Let's just- You know, you could have put this, like, right here on me, you know?

941
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,750
instead of, like- Wading in the- Hah ha!

942
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,150
Wading in the shield.

943
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,790
Like- Okay.

944
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,570
Nice.

945
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,090
Okay, I'll use my cannons again.

946
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,690
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

947
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,510
Don't worry.

948
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,870
Missile Time!

949
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:53,750
Pew, pew, pew!

950
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,670
Hi-Ea designer's thinking.

951
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,790
Look!

952
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,970
There're so many things going on, you think I heard getting the bubbles?!

953
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,150
Oh my god, why is he shooting me?

954
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,030
Okay, get in there.

955
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,630
Get in there.

956
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,070
Bistil him!

957
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,770
Yes!

958
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:13,690
Yes!

959
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:16,670
Okay.

960
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,050
Okay.

961
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,510
Oh, I dodged it, I think.

962
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,190
I think I dodged it.

963
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,490
Yeah!

964
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,290
Wait, did I do it?

965
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,330
Oh, I did it.

966
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,410
Oh my god, there's all of us.

967
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,190
We're a team.

968
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,830
Okay, let's go.

969
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,770
Oh my god, I did that.

970
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,330
I did that.

971
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,750
Smile.

972
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,130
Oh, that shit is cool.

973
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,150
I feel like I'm watching an episode right now.

974
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,140
I'm watching an anime episode right now.

975
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,440
Wait, I want to be the winged one.

976
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,540
Wait, two years later?

977
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,080
It's my birthday!

978
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,420
Two years later!

979
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,740
Happy birthday to me!

980
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,360
Attention, Shadow Special Task Force.

981
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,940
Rescue operation at Moshmok is about to begin.

982
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,280
All relevant personnel complete your final checks.

983
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,000
Weapon airdrop ready.

984
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,320
Weapon airdrop ready.

985
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,600
Cargo rocket ready.

986
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,260
Striker systems calibrated.

987
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,600
No error found.

988
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,440
Combatants, prepare to deploy.

989
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,380
Elise Ness, ready to strike.

990
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,300
Pilot in position.

991
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,380
Striker entering launch tunnel.

992
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,300
Brake system safety disengaged.

993
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,660
Oh, Valia!

994
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,880
Thank you for the Twitch Proud!

995
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,220
Thank you!

996
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:52,920
Thank you!

997
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,980
That's me!

998
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,280
Oh, she's cute!

999
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,120
For this mission, name's Anka Bell.

1000
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,480
Just joined Shadow.

1001
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,520
Still settling in, but looks like we're diving straight into missions.

1002
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,760
So let's do it!

1003
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:13,840
Pilot, for this mission, we'll locate the three patrol strikers we lost communications with in Moshmok.

1004
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,140
Yeah, thank you for the Twitch Proud!

1005
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:17,480
Thank you!

1006
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,220
Thank you!

1007
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,500
At an abandoned base to the southwest.

1008
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,320
Recently, a massive amount of Thea's forces have been active in the area.

1009
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,600
This is a rescue mission, so try to avoid going toe-to-toe.

1010
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,020
Now, our CO will fill you in with the details.

1011
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,380
Greetings, Pilot.

1012
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,380
I'm your commanding officer.

1013
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,020
My name is Christian.

1014
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,360
Hi, Christian!

1015
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,260
We're leading this operation.

1016
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,380
First, we'll drop you off just outside Moshmok's waters.

1017
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,220
You'll travel by submarine.

1018
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,120
From there, use the underwater elevator to reach the abandoned base.

1019
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,560
Your squad will meet you at the entrance.

1020
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,760
Wait, what- what happened in between the two ears?

1021
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm so- I'm a bit confused.

1022
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,140
Ready for anything.

1023
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,060
Close combat, long range, and solid defense.

1024
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,000
Why did we time skip?

1025
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,320
We won't let your striker go in naked like your last atmospheric entry.

1026
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,600
Injecting colexium particles.

1027
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,580
Wait, what happened?

1028
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,040
I thought- I thought- Sorry, I got, like, a planked out for, like, ten seconds.

1029
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,560
But, uh-

1030
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,970
I, like, keep forgetting what I made.

1031
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,330
I keep- I forgot what I looked like.

1032
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,660
Oh, shit!

1033
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,060
Like, I came from the ocean?

1034
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,780
Oh, I like that.

1035
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,740
I like that detail.

1036
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,700
Let's get going!

1037
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,380
Alright, let's go.

1038
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,560
Why does my- Oh, my mecha looks better than- Oh!

1039
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,620
Oh my god, okay.

1040
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,100
Well, I almost dropped down.

1041
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,460
Confirmed the extraction point ASAP.

1042
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,060
Alright, nice.

1043
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,900
Yeah, we skipped the filler episode.

1044
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,020
This is where the UWC built their mass driver.

1045
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,460
After the orbital elevator attack, the UWC disbanded, and the base was abandoned.

1046
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,900
We'll conduct our search here.

1047
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,260
What a waste of resources.

1048
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,060
Last SAT update shows strikers engaged in combat in the area.

1049
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,120
Wazoo!

1050
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,500
Do you have a guard?

1051
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,900
Not sure.

1052
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,360
They've been public enemy number one for the last two years.

1053
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,080
They were lunar civilians who fought their government for equal rights.

1054
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,440
But now, they've resorted to pure va- HQ!

1055
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,940
Do you copy?

1056
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,920
Hello, is anyone live in here?

1057
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,780
Looks like it was just shot down.

1058
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,300
That's what you get for trying to get equal rights.

1059
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,720
For mechas.

1060
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,580
That's right!

1061
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,700
Some mechas were built to be grunts!

1062
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,980
Alright, let's see.

1063
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,720
Some mechs were meant to be grunts!

1064
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,600
Okay.

1065
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,480
Just like these mechs.

1066
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,680
Oh, I forgot to kill this guy.

1067
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,420
What happened here?

1068
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,500
Why is Thea rallying here?

1069
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,280
Okay, I wanna go melee.

1070
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,180
I think melee is a lot faster.

1071
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,700
Yeah, melee is definitely a lot faster.

1072
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,000
That's right!

1073
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,140
Incoming!

1074
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,060
Watch out!

1075
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,900
Find an exit route!

1076
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,320
I'll hold him off!

1077
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:39,700
Oh!

1078
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,280
Shit!

1079
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:40,700
Okay!

1080
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,280
That's bad.

1081
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,000
I can still kill him.

1082
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,760
That's right!

1083
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,740
You think you're better than me?!

1084
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,320
Yeah!

1085
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,540
Oh my god!

1086
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,320
Yes it does!

1087
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,760
Oh!

1088
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,620
Oh no it doesn't!

1089
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,800
No it doesn't!

1090
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,240
No

1091
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,620
it doesn't!

1092
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,120
My bad!

1093
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,740
I won't need a run!

1094
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,820
I'm no coward!

1095
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,360
That's right!

1096
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,760
Pew pew pew pew pew pew!

1097
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,780
Pew pew pew pew pew!

1098
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,820
Okay.

1099
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,460
Oh my god.

1100
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,040
Okay, wait.

1101
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,300
This guy actually...

1102
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,360
This guy fucks.

1103
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,900
Oh no!

1104
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,600
My energy!

1105
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,160
My energy!

1106
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,380
My poor energy!

1107
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,400
It's fine!

1108
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,300
It- It's so fine!

1109
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,640
It's fine!

1110
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,240
That's right!

1111
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,500
It's so fine!

1112
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,320
Get out of here!

1113
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,680
I don't need shit!

1114
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,580
I'm strong!

1115
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,760
That's enough!

1116
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,340
Clue what we've been through!

1117
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,500
Oh?

1118
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,560
What happened?

1119
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,940
Oh!

1120
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,620
It's a...

1121
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,520
What is that?

1122
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,420
He's turning...

1123
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,520
He's returning to rock!

1124
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,380
Corite doesn't spread this quickly!

1125
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,800
You're not hearing this?

1126
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,320
Maggots?

1127
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,320
Phase 1 is done.

1128
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,640
Don't drag this out.

1129
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,680
Become a hero!

1130
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,260
Oh my god!

1131
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
All he wants to do is to be a hero!

1132
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,180
Haha!

1133
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,440
You're not better than me!

1134
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,320
Hahaha!

1135
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,400
That's right!

1136
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,480
Oh shit!

1137
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,800
Okay, I gotta shift out.

1138
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,140
Oh!

1139
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,580
Exterminate!

1140
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,060
Oh my god!

1141
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,420
Okay!

1142
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,640
That's fine!

1143
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,220
I have missile!

1144
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,720
Get out of here!

1145
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,440
You're so low!

1146
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,220
That's right!

1147
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,940
I'll take it all!

1148
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,680
I believe in the ta- Oh!

1149
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1150
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,300
No, no, no!

1151
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,760
Okay, wait, I can't be too greedy!

1152
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,580
Nevermind!

1153
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,480
Maybe I don't take it all!

1154
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,900
That's okay!

1155
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,180
It's okay!

1156
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,020
I need your coordinates!

1157
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,140
It's okay!

1158
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,680
I did it!

1159
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:21,980
Oh!

1160
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,640
I regen!

1161
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,080
Let's go!

1162
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,060
That's right!

1163
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,440
Haha!

1164
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,380
Hey!

1165
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,440
The Earth people should take over this area again!

1166
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,020
Deploy the extraction beacon!

1167
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,540
What are you waiting for?

1168
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,780
Now?

1169
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,520
I don't need shields!

1170
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,940
This is our only chance before the storm swallows this area!

1171
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,000
Now the airdrop can finally reach us!

1172
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,040
Oh!

1173
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,120
Repair striker!

1174
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,340
Now we're pretty tight on time!

1175
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,000
Ah!

1176
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,820
Let's freshen up before joining the fight!

1177
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,020
Okay, I was like, whoa!

1178
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,080
Where am I repairing?

1179
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:55,960
Haha!

1180
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,420
Haha!

1181
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,720
I was like, did I do it?

1182
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,260
Did I repair it?

1183
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:02,800
Haha!

1184
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,360
Now, press the interact key to select an airdrop!

1185
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:06,940
Okay!

1186
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,420
Okay!

1187
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,500
Oh!

1188
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,640
Okay!

1189
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,220
So I can summon weapons!

1190
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,720
Okay!

1191
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,020
Now- Now I know!

1192
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,200
Now- Okay!

1193
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,040
Let me see if I- Let's lower the- Okay!

1194
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,320
I don't think we need cinematic anymore, guys!

1195
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,580
Oh my god!

1196
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:23,760
Yeah!

1197
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,200
I don't- I don't think we need cinematic anymore!

1198
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,860
I didn't even know we had motion blur on!

1199
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,700
Alright!

1200
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,980
Let's put all of this at high, at least!

1201
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,880
Okay!

1202
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:39,940
Okay!

1203
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,220
Uh...

1204
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,580
Apply!

1205
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,780
There we go!

1206
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,840
There we go!

1207
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,540
I didn't even notice- Um...

1208
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,040
I didn't even notice that there was motion blur.

1209
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,340
It was not noticeable for me, to be fair.

1210
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,940
Destroy as many extractors as you can before the ship arrives.

1211
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,980
Oh, this is the extraction bone!

1212
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,500
Which triggers pulse storms.

1213
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,480
They might deploy more, to keep you from leaving!

1214
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,780
Yeah!

1215
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,680
I couldn't tell!

1216
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,540
Nice!

1217
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,960
Okay!

1218
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,260
One pulse storm will wipe out everything on the island!

1219
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,340
And the three factions are mining and researching Koray at MoshMosh.

1220
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,520
Is it some kind of power-play by Theon?

1221
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,300
To have their insane demands met?

1222
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,620
And fight the moon?

1223
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,100
But, uh, maybe it's not that simple.

1224
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,160
Did you see all those crystals everywhere?

1225
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,500
Yeah, I think I was- I was definitely moving so fast that I didn't notice, for sure.

1226
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,360
Cause it was not noticeable at all to me about the motion blur.

1227
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,360
Did I destroy it yet?

1228
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,600
Oh, okay.

1229
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,400
I was gonna say, how is it not destroyed?

1230
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,240
Okay, nice.

1231
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,220
Now we gotta destroy this.

1232
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,720
So I guess this is the MeshMack mode?

1233
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,580
I assume?

1234
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,040
You can't hit me if I'm in the sky!

1235
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,280
That's goddamn right!

1236
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,340
Haha!

1237
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,120
What you gonna do here when I'm in the goddamn sky?

1238
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,960
I don't have energy left.

1239
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,900
That's what you're gonna do.

1240
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,620
That-

1241
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,580
This is Earth's land!

1242
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,600
Get out of here, aliens!

1243
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,040
We need the resources!

1244
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,040
I know what happened in Avatar!

1245
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,400
We won, right?

1246
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,520
We won, right, guys?

1247
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,500
I don't think there's new war extractors.

1248
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,440
HQ has pinpointed the extraction area.

1249
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,420
Alright, nice.

1250
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,340
Let's go again.

1251
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,640
Oh shit, I forgot!

1252
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,340
Haha!

1253
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,560
Okay, we wait.

1254
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,180
We wait.

1255
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,060
I almost- I almost like- Oh wait, who's that?

1256
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:02,890
Alright.

1257
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,050
It's okay.

1258
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,730
I'll stay in the air, because I don't think they can hit me up here.

1259
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,250
It's fine.

1260
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:11,090
Yay!

1261
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,130
We did it!

1262
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,450
Storms are expanding?

1263
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,770
I don't even remember my energy level.

1264
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,950
Not- How much energy?

1265
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,270
Okay.

1266
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,650
I'm trying to figure out how much energy I- I use up there.

1267
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,250
At least there's no fall damage.

1268
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,050
Oh, my teammates are dying!

1269
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,550
Oh, I was supposed to hit that guy!

1270
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,770
Don't worry, I got you teammate!

1271
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,290
Pew pew pew!

1272
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:39,410
Pew!

1273
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,870
No need to thank me!

1274
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,700
New coil, alright.

1275
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,680
Oh, wait.

1276
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,300
Oh, this guy.

1277
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,880
I was gonna say, new what?

1278
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,700
Pew pew pew pew!

1279
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,040
Okay, he's dead.

1280
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,040
Yay!

1281
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,300
I'm a hero!

1282
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,120
Oh, my God!

1283
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,100
There's so many people!

1284
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:07,950
Oh, my God!

1285
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,190
There's more?!

1286
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,090
How many are- Why do there's so many people want to kill me?

1287
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,290
I'm just a nice guy.

1288
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,590
I don't commit that much murder.

1289
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,090
Okay.

1290
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:24,610
Oh, my God.

1291
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,390
There's another ship.

1292
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,160
Okay, that's fine.

1293
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,880
I get closer to them.

1294
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,780
I'm glad my teammates are being meat shields right now.

1295
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,760
Yay!

1296
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,700
I did it!

1297
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,540
Thank you to my team for being good meat shields.

1298
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,120
Goodbye, team!

1299
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,760
Oh, my God.

1300
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,600
Who's shooting me?

1301
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,160
Who is shooting me?

1302
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,840
I can't de- Oh, my God.

1303
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,600
I can't deploy.

1304
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,120
I can't deploy because they're all shooting me.

1305
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,760
Okay, that's fine.

1306
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,820
My teammates got this.

1307
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,300
Oh, my God.

1308
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:02,820
Who is it?

1309
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,220
Who is it?!

1310
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,520
Get out of here!

1311
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,660
Okay.

1312
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,380
Okay, now I can.

1313
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,200
Okay.

1314
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,460
It's fine.

1315
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,600
I can't!

1316
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,700
When they shoot you, it interrupts at me.

1317
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,560
So, I can't- I have to, like, kill them before I can do it.

1318
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,340
Goddamn p-shooters.

1319
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,020
They just want you to stay.

1320
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,100
They're like, we missed you.

1321
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,480
Okay, the shield sort of looks badass, though.

1322
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,160
Okay, not gonna lie.

1323
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,240
It may or- It sort of does look a little badass.

1324
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,760
Alright, nice.

1325
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,340
Yay!

1326
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,880
I did the- So, that was the MASHMACK tutorial.

1327
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Oh, that's interesting.

1328
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
Yeah, so it's, like, basically, like, an extraction shooter.

1329
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,520
That's me!

1330
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,640
Our main character material.

1331
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,600
I thought we would still have at least a hundred years to figure a way out of our demise after the catastrophe.

1332
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:23,300
But now that we're seeing how fast Korite spreads, that estimate might, in fact, be closer to 30 years, or perhaps even less than that.

1333
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,580
Oh, that's, like, the- the virus type deal.

1334
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,740
to the catastrophe, due to the emergence of Korite.

1335
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,980
I saw a chance for us to unite, to rebuild our homes.

1336
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,940
I had high hopes that Korite could spur growth in technology, and offer a path to human survival.

1337
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,920
But ironically, we've put everything we know into this striker behind me.

1338
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,720
That's me!

1339
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,080
That's my striker!

1340
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,320
All it changes is how we fight each other.

1341
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,580
Another way to quench our thirst for blood.

1342
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,540
Yeah, but are we winning?

1343
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,340
Everybody wants a better life.

1344
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,120
Fertile land.

1345
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,820
Breathable air.

1346
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,900
So we keep scrabbling over what's left of Earth's resources.

1347
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,530
And during a recent operation in MASHMACK, one of our brave pilots discovered that...

1348
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,480
Korite...

1349
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,520
is conscious.

1350
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,080
Oh, yeah!

1351
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,580
Because he took over...

1352
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,440
that Mecha.

1353
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,540
We're not sure if it's a sentient being in a different form.

1354
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,760
Was it like a hive mind?

1355
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,500
But it's spreading...

1356
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,340
much faster than we expected.

1357
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,220
As you might already know, Shadow was founded to resolve conflicts...

1358
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,860
It's like...

1359
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,980
mechs...

1360
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,140
humans versus...

1361
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:40,740
the environment.

1362
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,380
Because we're like destroying the Earth...

1363
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,080
and like battling over resources...

1364
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,960
so they're like...

1365
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,280
STOP!

1366
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,320
STOP!

1367
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,400
GET OUT OF THIS PLANET!

1368
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,140
Humanity can't get its act together.

1369
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,720
It's on us to bridge the gap between humanity and Korite.

1370
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,480
MASHMACK's ground zero for Korite disasters.

1371
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,660
And a battleground for extremist factions.

1372
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,020
It's our job to stop these lunatics from losing Korite...

1373
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,680
Or I'll stop your life.

1374
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:15,520
...pulluming the circus...

1375
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,680
...and wiping out humanity.

1376
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,180
And even if Korite proves to be sentient...

1377
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,640
...which it may...

1378
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,740
...we still need to find a way to survive.

1379
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,580
Let's buy humanity some more time.

1380
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,420
Yay!

1381
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,020
So we can destroy the Earth more!

1382
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,080
Let's go!

1383
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,520
Hey Christian, can I talk to you real quick?

1384
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,480
That voice from the last battle...

1385
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,960
I don't think that it came from the pilot.

1386
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,000
Interesting.

1387
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,640
We're looking into the combat data and...

1388
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,560
The combat data?

1389
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,920
No, that's not it.

1390
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,200
I'm talking about something completely different.

1391
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,280
I've got a bad feeling...

1392
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,060
Guys, I'm listening to the plot right now.

1393
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,840
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

1394
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,320
No comment.

1395
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,680
I'm not taking any interviews.

1396
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,880
Evolving into Silicon-based life forms.

1397
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,760
That sounds like something you might see in an old sci-fi movie.

1398
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,880
If that's the case...

1399
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,300
We're literally living our sci-fi movie!

1400
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,400
Get some rest.

1401
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,140
I'll keep you guys updated.

1402
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,800
This is sci-fi!

1403
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,480
What you talking about, Christian?

1404
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,880
Wait, I can take a...

1405
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,760
I can take a photo?

1406
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,520
Wait, what does that look like?

1407
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,540
Official preset?

1408
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,380
Aw!

1409
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,720
Aw!

1410
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,720
Aw, that's cute!

1411
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,620
Okay.

1412
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,320
Aw, that's cute!

1413
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,740
Aw, I can...

1414
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,460
Aw, I can position her, too!

1415
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,000
Aw, my God!

1416
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,200
Aw, my God!

1417
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:46,620
Wait!

1418
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,120
Okay, this is so detailed.

1419
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,340
What does this do?

1420
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:50,420
I can take a photo.

1421
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,520
Ha, ha, ha!

1422
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,600
Ha, ha!

1423
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,640
Dead drop tap.

1424
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,180
Poom!

1425
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,200
Oh, that is...

1426
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,000
That is a lot.

1427
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,700
That is actually...

1428
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,200
Alright.

1429
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,760
Take photo.

1430
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:07,760
Yay!

1431
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,820
Ha, ha!

1432
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,080
Yay!

1433
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,400
In America!

1434
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,240
Let's go!

1435
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,100
I don't wanna...

1436
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,200
I don't think I should share this.

1437
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,080
I...

1438
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1439
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,700
Oh, I can't, like, have different... Oh my god, I can't even see her.

1440
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,380
Oh, I have different fingers, too?

1441
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,820
Oh, that's cute.

1442
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,100
That's actually cute.

1443
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,840
Alright.

1444
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,140
Is she okay?

1445
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,300
I think so.

1446
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,020
Let's see what she looks like right now.

1447
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,320
Yeah, she's okay.

1448
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,420
Alright.

1449
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,000
We will not save.

1450
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,640
Alright, nice.

1451
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,100
We'll return.

1452
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,720
Oh, that's cute.

1453
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,880
We get to take photos.

1454
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,520
Where did I not go?

1455
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,880
Oh my god, look at that robot go!

1456
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,160
Dance, robot!

1457
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,700
Dance!

1458
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,740
Okay, return to my room for the next... What's this?

1459
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,340
Terminal?

1460
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,180
Oh!

1461
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,140
Wait, is this... Oh!

1462
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh, okay.

1463
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,060
That's, like, the lobby.

1464
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,980
Oh, so it's, like, an interactive lobby.

1465
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,220
Oh, that's... That's cool.

1466
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,140
Okay, I like that.

1467
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,280
It's definitely a lot more immersive, too.

1468
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,380
Also, by the way, you guys want to check out Mechabrick right now?

1469
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,080
You can... It's actually free right now.

1470
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,900
And you can click on my link pinned in chat or exclamation point Mechabrick.

1471
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,320
Uh, and you can check out the... Uh, you can check it out yourself as well.

1472
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,560
Oh, I like how it's, like, super immersive, too, for the lobby.

1473
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,220
Whoa!

1474
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,560
New mission received.

1475
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,000
All relevant personnel proceed to the tactical station.

1476
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,920
Oh, all right.

1477
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,500
Okay, we got new orders, guys.

1478
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,580
Remember to check... Wait.

1479
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,600
Oh, wait!

1480
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,660
They're speaking Chinese!

1481
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,320
Oh, my God.

1482
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,160
CTV 13.

1483
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,440
All right.

1484
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,680
Let me, uh, go here.

1485
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,520
Head to the tactical station.

1486
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,740
Hello, everybody!

1487
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,120
Things aren't looking good, Chief.

1488
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,940
Core rights everywhere.

1489
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,880
Resources are running low.

1490
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,580
At this point, wars are unavoidable.

1491
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,000
More than anything, this is a test of morals.

1492
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,760
Why don't we just work together to defeat the Core's?

1493
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,460
Right, but I'm not in my breath on that.

1494
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,040
The world leaders are not going to talk this one out.

1495
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,200
The three factions and the moon are openly at each other's throats.

1496
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,400
The world's in shambles.

1497
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,180
Pair that with the chaos and moshmok and the borders.

1498
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,000
Our hands are already pretty full.

1499
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:59,320
Besides, our pilots need different strikers for various combat situations.

1500
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,580
And what about the pilots?

1501
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,040
No, I didn't play the test for it.

1502
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,840
This is my first time playing it.

1503
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,140
We're short on pilots at the moment.

1504
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,900
So that means we're counting on you for this mission.

1505
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,880
Mizra Matrix will send five striker pilots alongside our squad for this operation.

1506
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,460
You know how it is.

1507
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,760
Strategy and striker pairings are key in co-op missions.

1508
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,880
Oh, there's co-op missions?

1509
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,920
Confirm your striker with Alessio.

1510
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,240
Get prepped and move out as soon as the mission's live.

1511
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,820
We just rolled out a new brake striker.

1512
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,020
Come on.

1513
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:37,940
I'll show you.

1514
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,760
You'll love it.

1515
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,680
No, it's a...

1516
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,300
It's a third-person shooter.

1517
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,240
So...

1518
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:42,660
Oh, okay.

1519
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Now we're at...

1520
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:45,700
Reporting.

1521
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,420
Visit Ace Recruitment to purchase and deploy Leone, Pirova, and Lock...

1522
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,820
Okay, so now we can check out all the other...

1523
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,860
Oh, Christian's Challenge.

1524
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,400
Okay.

1525
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,240
And then you can follow them and everything.

1526
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:58,960
Yay!

1527
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,900
Oh, that's all my uniforms.

1528
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,320
Oh, Daily Sign-ins.

1529
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,160
Okay.

1530
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,080
Oh, that uniform's cute.

1531
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,600
That's actually pretty cute.

1532
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,260
That's a pretty cute uniform.

1533
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,880
But I think I like my current outfit right now.

1534
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:17,800
Um...

1535
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,760
I like my current outfit at the moment.

1536
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,940
Wait, why is...

1537
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,140
Oh, is this like the current...

1538
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,180
Okay, so these are...

1539
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,680
I assume...

1540
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,560
Okay, these are all the strikers you can be.

1541
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,800
So there's...

1542
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,240
Medium Attacker.

1543
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,180
Light Attacker.

1544
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:30,760
Ultra Heavy.

1545
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,600
This is a tank.

1546
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:32,800
I assume...

1547
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,920
Brother is the...

1548
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,460
Melee.

1549
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,220
Oh!

1550
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,160
Narukami!

1551
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,040
Light Sniper.

1552
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,460
Okay, what about Heavy Sniper?

1553
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,400
I actually wanna try...

1554
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,820
I wanna try...

1555
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,720
I wanna try...

1556
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,120
Akira.

1557
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,830
Oh, that looks sick.

1558
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,750
Airborne Kit.

1559
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,410
Mobile Beam Cannon.

1560
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,580
B, B, C, C.

1561
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,060
Okay.

1562
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:08,480
Oh...

1563
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,040
I like that.

1564
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,520
Actually, I like the...

1565
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:11,920
How they...

1566
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,900
Wait, actually, what does it look like when I...

1567
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,900
Swap to...

1568
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,620
Okay, what about Medium Support?

1569
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,220
What does that look like?

1570
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,200
Is that the one with the wings?

1571
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,120
Oh, she has a little drone!

1572
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,960
Oh, a little repair drone!

1573
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:26,600
Rapid...

1574
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,660
Oh, I can grapple!

1575
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,100
Oh, I can grapple!

1576
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,000
Oh, I can grapple!

1577
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,480
I like that.

1578
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,920
I like how it does, like, a little, like, introduction.

1579
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,180
And you can skip it, too.

1580
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,900
So you don't have to, like, look at it for too long.

1581
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:38,860
Okay, that's cute.

1582
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,580
But I wanna try...

1583
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,160
Oh, there's...

1584
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,940
I wanna try the...

1585
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,460
What do I wanna try?

1586
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,220
I wanna try...

1587
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,640
Yeah, I wanna try Akira.

1588
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,360
Oh, so I just unlocked these.

1589
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,920
So they're all free for now.

1590
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,260
Yeah.

1591
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,920
All of these are, like, free.

1592
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,820
So you just click on it.

1593
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,160
And then you don't have to look at the intro again.

1594
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,200
I wanna look...

1595
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,320
But, like, I hope...

1596
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,380
I really like the intro.

1597
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,280
So I hope, like, you can, like, replay it.

1598
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,300
Too.

1599
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:00,820
Okay.

1600
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,600
What's Tactical Station?

1601
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,960
Yeah, the intro cutscene looks so badass.

1602
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,760
I like that.

1603
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,840
What's that?

1604
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,940
Oh, okay.

1605
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,120
First squad to complete the objective wins.

1606
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,160
Oh, so these are, like...

1607
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:15,560
Oh!

1608
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,120
These are the different...

1609
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,660
Uh...

1610
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,160
This is a...

1611
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,960
This is a deathmatch.

1612
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,580
So this is a 6v6 hero shooter.

1613
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,920
This one is the deathmatch.

1614
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,140
Um...

1615
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,580
Under...

1616
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,380
Is Operation Storm the mash-mack?

1617
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:28,640
Okay.

1618
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,540
Operation Storm is the extraction.

1619
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:32,880
So...

1620
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,160
Um...

1621
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,520
So we wanna do Extraction Shooter.

1622
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,060
This is the Extraction Shooter mode.

1623
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,960
And then this one is the 6v6 versus 3v3.

1624
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,680
First squad to achieve 8 kills.

1625
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:45,740
And then...

1626
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,440
What's the marketplace?

1627
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,140
Oh, that's for skins and stuff.

1628
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:49,480
Okay.

1629
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,960
That's interesting.

1630
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,920
And then...

1631
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,120
Oh!

1632
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,420
The first one!

1633
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,140
So, like...

1634
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,000
You see the Striker Bay?

1635
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,140
I just noticed.

1636
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,220
The Striker Bay...

1637
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,780
Oh, and then you can swap weapons?

1638
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,780
Charge Rifle...

1639
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,080
Oh...

1640
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,540
Oh, it tells you what I have.

1641
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,580
You know what?

1642
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,120
I can...

1643
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,120
Is there training grounds?

1644
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,460
I wonder if there's training grounds for this.

1645
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,420
That's a...

1646
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,300
Yeah, there's a lot.

1647
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,060
Uh...

1648
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,280
That's matchmaking.

1649
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,520
Uh...

1650
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,960
Is it training grounds, chat?

1651
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,940
There's a training mode?

1652
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,860
Where is that?

1653
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:26,840
Pilots...

1654
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,240
There's me.

1655
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,340
Is it Striker Design?

1656
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,100
Oh, no.

1657
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:34,620
I can edit.

1658
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,580
Oh, I can...

1659
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,060
Oh, my God.

1660
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,040
I can actually...

1661
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,680
Oh, no.

1662
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,920
Don't give me all that power.

1663
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:39,500
No.

1664
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:43,980
No.

1665
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,940
That's too much power.

1666
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,520
Oh, there it is.

1667
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,160
There's training.

1668
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:47,920
Okay.

1669
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,640
I want to see the ability...

1670
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,020
Don't...

1671
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,420
That's too much power.

1672
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:51,980
Hey.

1673
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,800
Guys, I can't.

1674
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,960
We got a...

1675
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,660
I can't.

1676
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,680
You know I'm gonna lose so much time...

1677
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,400
Doing that.

1678
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,960
Guys, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1679
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,340
Thank you.

1680
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:05,680
Thank you.

1681
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,640
I just want to know what the Sniper is like.

1682
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,780
Oh, so it actually is sniping.

1683
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,280
Okay.

1684
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,860
Oh, it is.

1685
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,540
Okay.

1686
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,960
And then what's my other weapon?

1687
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,660
What is my other weapon, though?

1688
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:27,610
Okay.

1689
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:28,770
Mobility kit.

1690
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,670
Wait.

1691
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,150
I'm fly.

1692
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:32,730
Wait.

1693
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:33,350
I can fly.

1694
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,010
Mobility kit deactivated.

1695
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,990
Oh, so that's my...

1696
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,270
Oh, so I can fly.

1697
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,870
What's this?

1698
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:43,630
What am I doing?

1699
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,260
Oh, I have...

1700
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,220
I can hover too?

1701
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,200
Oh.

1702
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,940
So I can literally fly like this.

1703
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,700
What's the...

1704
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,800
What's three?

1705
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,340
What does three do?

1706
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,500
Mobility kit deactivated.

1707
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:04,880
Okay.

1708
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,080
I'm going to do the...

1709
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,280
Weapons overview.

1710
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:08,600
Alright.

1711
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,780
Sniper mode.

1712
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,380
Pulse claw.

1713
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,240
One.

1714
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,340
Airborne kit.

1715
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:13,700
Three.

1716
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,440
Oh!

1717
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,700
So I have a lock-on mode.

1718
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:18,980
Wait.

1719
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,720
What does one do?

1720
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,300
Target required.

1721
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,000
Oh, I need to set targets up.

1722
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,740
How do I set up?

1723
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,400
Hmm.

1724
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,080
Uh...

1725
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,820
Training settings.

1726
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,360
Okay.

1727
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,020
Select striker.

1728
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,020
Uh...

1729
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,500
We'll put...

1730
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,300
Alright.

1731
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,140
Where is he?

1732
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,720
I need to use you.

1733
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:49,900
Oh, shit!

1734
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,220
Ha ha!

1735
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,680
Okay.

1736
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,220
That's cool.

1737
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,040
Okay.

1738
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,340
Oh.

1739
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,780
Oh!

1740
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:58,780
It's aimbot!

1741
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,220
It's literally aimbot!

1742
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:01,580
Alright.

1743
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,080
Nice.

1744
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,760
I did...

1745
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,680
I did play the tutorial.

1746
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,020
I'm just trying different characters right now.

1747
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,380
So I'm ha...

1748
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,140
I'm trying this...

1749
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,220
The heavy sniper.

1750
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,400
So I...

1751
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,120
The three is just literally...

1752
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,320
Uh...

1753
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,900
Three is just like aimbot.

1754
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:18,940
Because it...

1755
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,740
Wait.

1756
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,580
Is there...

1757
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,000
Headshots?

1758
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,240
No.

1759
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:22,800
It's not.

1760
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,040
Oh!

1761
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:24,460
Wait!

1762
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,400
There's no headshots!

1763
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,020
I can literally just...

1764
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,080
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1765
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,260
I don't have to shoot it.

1766
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,060
It like auto-ing.

1767
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:32,340
Auto-aims.

1768
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:32,680
Nice!

1769
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,920
There's no headshots.

1770
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,860
I'm pretty sure.

1771
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,720
It's just auto-aim.

1772
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,040
I'm pretty sure.

1773
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:46,820
Okay.

1774
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,400
Yeah.

1775
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,780
It just auto-aims for me.

1776
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,860
As long as...

1777
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:54,980
Oh!

1778
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,220
I'm pretty sure there's no headshots.

1779
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,540
Right?

1780
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,800
It just hits.

1781
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,280
Yeah.

1782
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,620
And I don't have...

1783
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,120
I don't have a melee.

1784
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,640
So that's like the only issue.

1785
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,620
Like I'm literally just sniping.

1786
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,340
Execute.

1787
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:11,580
No.

1788
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:12,740
Let me execute.

1789
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,140
No!

1790
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,060
It's too late!

1791
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:15,960
No!

1792
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,020
All right.

1793
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:19,740
Okay.

1794
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,500
I think I'm ready.

1795
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,220
I'm ready.

1796
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,560
I'm so good at this training thing.

1797
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,660
All right.

1798
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,060
It's time to...

1799
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,400
Oh, there is headshot damage multiplier.

1800
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:37,810
He...

1801
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:38,550
I don't feel it.

1802
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,190
I don't know if I do need...

1803
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,230
I'm so ready.

1804
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:41,770
All right.

1805
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,210
I'm going to be the wit...

1806
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,590
I'm going to be the...

1807
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,570
The sniper in the 6v6.

1808
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,390
And people are going to hate me.

1809
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:49,110
But that's okay.

1810
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,010
I...

1811
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,630
People are going to be mad.

1812
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,130
That's me.

1813
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,520
All right.

1814
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:07,900
Heavy defender.

1815
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:08,880
Heavy...

1816
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,760
Literally.

1817
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,540
We guys...

1818
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,900
We have no support, guys.

1819
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,840
Guys, guys.

1820
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,940
We may...

1821
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,020
Guys, we don't have a support, guys.

1822
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,620
Guys, are we fucked?

1823
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,500
We don't have a support.

1824
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,320
We don't need support.

1825
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,540
It's over.

1826
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,280
Thank you for the hundred videos.

1827
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,460
Thank you.

1828
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,280
Guys, I think we're missing something, guys.

1829
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,340
GG's.

1830
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:42,980
No heals.

1831
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,600
It's okay.

1832
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,980
We don't need support, guys.

1833
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,180
If we kill all of them...

1834
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,200
If we kill all of them...

1835
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,340
We can just win.

1836
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:58,940
Exactly.

1837
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,900
Just kill them first.

1838
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:02,720
All right.

1839
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:04,860
We're waiting.

1840
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,060
What are we waiting for?

1841
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:08,900
Approach.

1842
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,720
Oh, dismantle it.

1843
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:10,860
Okay.

1844
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,940
So we have to be the first to dismantle the most.

1845
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,260
That's me.

1846
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:19,100
Okay.

1847
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,420
Guys, they don't look like they have support either, right?

1848
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,080
I can't tell.

1849
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,700
I don't know what they're playing.

1850
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,080
Okay, guys.

1851
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,840
We just gotta make sure we don't accidentally press T.

1852
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,020
What is he doing?

1853
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,200
He's just a play.

1854
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,720
Oh, my God.

1855
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:51,800
Oh, my God.

1856
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,500
Is he hitting me?

1857
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,860
Oh, it's because I'm leaving the combat zone.

1858
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:55,280
Whoops.

1859
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,180
Give me a sec.

1860
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,620
Oh, my God.

1861
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,680
This is just an air fight.

1862
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,240
Oh, my God.

1863
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,980
I'm gaming.

1864
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,420
Guys, I told you we don't...

1865
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,720
We don't need support.

1866
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,680
Look at us go.

1867
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,700
I have no idea where anybody is.

1868
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,240
I...

1869
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,940
That's right.

1870
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,080
What's going on?

1871
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,180
Oh, my God.

1872
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:34,800
Where am I?

1873
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,640
Oh.

1874
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,620
There we go.

1875
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,840
Oh, I'm gaming.

1876
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,720
Oh, this is so easy.

1877
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,700
Where am I?

1878
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,020
Oh, shit.

1879
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,140
Whoa.

1880
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,620
I'm flying.

1881
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:02,730
That's it.

1882
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:03,810
Auto aim.

1883
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:07,890
Oh, my God.

1884
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:09,210
He wants to kill me so bad.

1885
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,750
He does not like me.

1886
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,730
You're so bad, bro.

1887
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:21,760
Bro.

1888
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,280
Oh, my God.

1889
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:24,780
He's one.

1890
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,460
You're so mad.

1891
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,040
You're so mad, dude.

1892
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,180
Oh, wait.

1893
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,040
I need energy.

1894
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,400
I don't have energy anymore.

1895
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,820
Guys, I need...

1896
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,020
I'm not doing objective.

1897
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,400
Oh, my God.

1898
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:41,660
Wait.

1899
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,960
I think we might lose because none of us are doing objective.

1900
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,920
Oh, my God.

1901
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,120
Okay.

1902
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,220
That's fine.

1903
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,460
That's fine.

1904
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,360
Do we do it?

1905
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,220
Are we...

1906
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,200
I don't know if we're winning.

1907
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,520
Let him out.

1908
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,360
Don't get him to me.

1909
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,920
Don't get him.

1910
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,400
I'm very empty.

1911
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:14,680
Please.

1912
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,940
I'm just sniping.

1913
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,260
Okay.

1914
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:25,800
Oh, my God.

1915
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,520
He's so fast.

1916
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,400
He's actually so fast.

1917
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:31,800
Oh, I hit him.

1918
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,220
I hit him.

1919
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:32,660
Nice.

1920
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:33,900
Double kill.

1921
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,040
Oh, we have to go to the extractor.

1922
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,100
It's okay.

1923
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:37,940
It's okay.

1924
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:46,820
Okay.

1925
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,220
This is so easy.

1926
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,080
Wait.

1927
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,260
This is so easy, but, man.

1928
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,290
Did we do that?

1929
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:01,450
I think we did.

1930
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,890
Oh, we are definitely winning.

1931
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:03,930
Bro, we're...

1932
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:06,190
These guys are actually so bad.

1933
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:09,970
Poor guy.

1934
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,490
Okay, we got to get to this one.

1935
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,090
That's right.

1936
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,570
Get sniped.

1937
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:21,270
Oh, my God.

1938
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:21,970
I keep...

1939
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:25,470
I keep accidentally...

1940
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,110
Okay.

1941
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,070
Did I snagged him?

1942
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:27,390
Nice.

1943
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,410
Poor guys.

1944
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:31,670
They're pretty bad.

1945
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:35,430
This has to...

1946
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,130
No, there's...

1947
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:36,510
Yeah, no.

1948
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:37,510
They're not.

1949
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:38,410
They can't be real.

1950
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:39,850
They can't be real.

1951
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,670
I cannot believe they're real.

1952
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:49,750
I'll be...

1953
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,210
No, the...

1954
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:52,770
The enemy team has 281 ping.

1955
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,170
There's no way.

1956
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,030
I think they're real.

1957
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:55,910
They're...

1958
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,230
I think they're real.

1959
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,610
It actually has their ping in everything.

1960
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:01,830
Wait.

1961
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:02,830
Wait.

1962
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:05,010
I think they're real because they have ping.

1963
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:06,190
Wait.

1964
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:14,070
I just think they're real because of the ping.

1965
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:21,970
Okay.

1966
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:22,610
I think it...

1967
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,130
Yeah, I got him.

1968
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:23,430
Nice.

1969
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:25,310
Okay.

1970
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,350
I got to make sure I don't...

1971
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:26,550
Whoa!

1972
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:27,510
What?

1973
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,700
Just a sniper.

1974
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,020
The sky is ours.

1975
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:34,560
Oh, my God.

1976
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,060
Oh, my God.

1977
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,620
I'm so low.

1978
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,380
Oh, my God.

1979
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,800
They actually aim for the sniper.

1980
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,840
They're actually...

1981
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,240
No!

1982
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,580
Oh!

1983
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,320
He actually...

1984
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,940
He actually hit the sniper.

1985
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,160
You freak!

1986
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,440
He got that freak.

1987
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,200
Oh, they had enough.

1988
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,580
No way.

1989
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,400
I can't believe it.

1990
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:03,080
He actually...

1991
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,940
That went for me.

1992
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,820
Those freaks.

1993
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:08,600
Did we win?

1994
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,040
Yay!

1995
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:09,980
We won.

1996
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,910
I lost it too, Billy.

1997
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,030
GG.

1998
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:18,510
Wait.

1999
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,930
There's no way.

2000
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,030
Wait a minute.

2001
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:21,330
Oh, wait.

2002
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:22,990
Am I...

2003
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:23,830
Did I get...

2004
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,470
Oh, I'm MVP!

2005
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:25,750
Yeah, that's right!

2006
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,890
Oh!

2007
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,350
Look at me go!

2008
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:30,330
Victory!

2009
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,990
Oh, easy.

2010
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:34,290
Oh, easy.

2011
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:37,550
Oh, that's me again!

2012
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:39,990
Oh, yeah.

2013
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:40,930
Watch this.

2014
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:43,890
That's right.

2015
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:44,930
Let's go.

2016
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:46,330
Oh, and it's more...

2017
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:46,570
Sorry.

2018
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,570
I have the longest play of the game ever.

2019
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,830
Because every game is play of the game.

2020
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:55,650
Every...

2021
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,230
Oh, my God.

2022
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:57,830
Look at that.

2023
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,670
Wait.

2024
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:00,330
Not MVP?

2025
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,190
Not MVP?

2026
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:04,990
Wait.

2027
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:06,190
But...

2028
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:08,270
But everything looks so cool.

2029
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:09,910
I'm not MVP!

2030
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:12,210
It ain't something to mess with.

2031
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:15,110
Oh.

2032
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,250
But I'm so many...

2033
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,710
I thought he was looking at this.

2034
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:19,250
I was like, look!

2035
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:19,910
I'm MVP!

2036
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,390
That's the end.

2037
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,180
I was just panning.

2038
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,720
But guys, look at me, guys.

2039
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:26,420
Oh, my God.

2040
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,340
It looks so cool.

2041
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,920
I was just panning myself.

2042
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,060
I was like this...

2043
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:37,700
It's like the podium thing where you see like second place and stuff like first, second, and third place.

2044
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,300
And I'm like the guy on the second place freaking out.

2045
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,300
And be like, oh, my God.

2046
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,600
I did it, guys.

2047
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:43,960
Okay.

2048
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:44,500
Let's check.

2049
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,660
Let's check.

2050
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,280
I bet you they're real.

2051
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,580
They have to be real.

2052
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:48,820
Okay.

2053
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,640
0.1.

2054
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:50,360
Okay.

2055
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,660
To be fair, the game just came out.

2056
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,200
So I can't even tell.

2057
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,140
I can't tell if they're real or not.

2058
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,820
Because the game literally just came out.

2059
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,760
So everybody has 0.1 hours.

2060
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:06,920
Okay.

2061
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:09,520
Next.

2062
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,510
I can't believe it.

2063
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,270
We got robbed.

2064
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,530
I mean, I did a lot, though.

2065
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,990
Yeah, the game just came out an hour ago.

2066
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,330
Oh, I got so many badges.

2067
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,250
Nice.

2068
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,530
Got coins.

2069
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:32,770
Oh, I'm making it.

2070
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:33,470
I'm getting there.

2071
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,550
Actually, I like the hero mode.

2072
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:37,770
Alright.

2073
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:38,790
Let's try...

2074
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:40,290
I like my character.

2075
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,190
I don't...

2076
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:47,930
I mean, the good thing is that you can try out different...

2077
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,110
Okay.

2078
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:49,570
Let's try the...

2079
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,750
Let's try...

2080
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:53,210
Okay.

2081
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,130
There's heavy...

2082
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:55,050
Is there medium sniper?

2083
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:55,290
Okay.

2084
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,750
I want to try...

2085
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:57,950
Let's see.

2086
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,410
Oh.

2087
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,610
Oh my god.

2088
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:00,490
It's so hard to choose.

2089
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,030
They all look so good.

2090
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,950
Valerius, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2091
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:04,250
Thank you.

2092
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:04,750
Thank you.

2093
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:05,290
Hi, tier.

2094
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,410
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2095
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:06,730
Thank you.

2096
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:07,410
Thank you.

2097
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:08,810
Ah.

2098
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:11,930
Okay.

2099
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,830
The guy who played Panther...

2100
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,230
When he, like, grappled to me was, like, scary.

2101
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:21,760
He turned...

2102
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,980
Oh, I shot that guy who turned into a turret.

2103
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:27,500
Bifrost Industry.

2104
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:28,200
Oh.

2105
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,040
Okay.

2106
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,620
I assume that guy...

2107
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,680
I assume he, like...

2108
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,020
Um.

2109
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,300
I assume...

2110
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,420
He's, like, medium brawler.

2111
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,740
So, I assume he...

2112
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:39,420
Uh.

2113
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,260
He's, like, dive.

2114
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:41,740
Right?

2115
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,900
Because his name is Panther.

2116
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:44,960
Alright.

2117
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:45,420
Let's see.

2118
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:47,620
Uh.

2119
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,100
The light sniper's a lot of fun.

2120
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:49,380
Alright.

2121
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,340
I'm done with you.

2122
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,960
I'm done with you.

2123
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,020
Alright.

2124
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:56,720
I want to snipe.

2125
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,570
I don't want to play with you anymore.

2126
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:11,530
Someone was, like, light sniper's pretty fun.

2127
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:12,510
I was, like, bet?

2128
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,390
Oh, my God.

2129
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,770
It's, like...

2130
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,330
She's, like, a centaur type deal.

2131
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:20,470
The backs here.

2132
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,530
It looks like an extra leg.

2133
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,190
I love all the mechs design.

2134
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,590
The mecha designs are pretty cool.

2135
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:26,670
Not gonna lie.

2136
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:27,810
Okay.

2137
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,070
This one has camo?

2138
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,150
Oh, they'll never know.

2139
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:30,710
Alright.

2140
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:31,510
Let's see...

2141
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,730
Let's see what she does.

2142
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:35,450
Um...

2143
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,430
I want to go to training and see what she does.

2144
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,170
Yo!

2145
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,070
Why is this mech high?

2146
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:47,030
Alright.

2147
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:47,950
Let's see.

2148
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:49,990
Um...

2149
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:50,370
Wait, no.

2150
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:51,250
F2?

2151
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:52,190
Okay.

2152
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,650
There's sniper mode.

2153
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,810
Charge beam cannon.

2154
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,890
Fires plasma in defect.

2155
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:58,250
Okay.

2156
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:03,510
Deploys stationary drone to generate a mask that decays that coordinates with the striker.

2157
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,270
Dealing minor damage and putting the striker into stealth mode when within range.

2158
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,490
Stealth is disabled.

2159
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:11,090
Auto recalls when up to two droids.

2160
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:12,090
Uh...

2161
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,770
Useable drone immobile.

2162
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:14,130
Okay.

2163
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,060
Okay.

2164
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:20,700
That's...

2165
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:20,800
Okay.

2166
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,460
So this is my stealth thing.

2167
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:23,680
And tactical.

2168
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,100
Cancel stagger and fires the grappler to pull the striker and enter stealth.

2169
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,540
Pulling a locked target causes the striker to leap over and stagger it.

2170
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,220
Finding a vertical terrain lets the striker hang on to it.

2171
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,500
Stealth is disabled.

2172
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:44,020
And then optical camel drone deploys a station that puts all allies within range into stealth.

2173
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,220
Stealth is...

2174
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:45,380
Okay.

2175
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,240
So three is my stealth mode.

2176
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:47,940
Okay.

2177
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,720
So this is...

2178
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,900
What's the range though?

2179
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,200
How do I...

2180
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,680
How do I use it?

2181
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,160
What?

2182
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,180
Oh!

2183
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:03,640
Okay.

2184
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:06,460
Okay.

2185
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,420
So I'm like a little...

2186
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:07,620
Oh!

2187
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,720
I'm like a spider!

2188
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:10,640
Okay.

2189
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,120
I get it.

2190
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,080
And I can have two of my drones with me.

2191
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:17,340
Okay.

2192
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,580
So they basically attack for me.

2193
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,460
Alright.

2194
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,180
Let's...

2195
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,800
Let's grab someone here.

2196
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,240
Optical camo activated.

2197
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:28,850
Okay.

2198
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:31,690
And then...

2199
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:33,530
Optical camo deactivated.

2200
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:35,850
How far is my range for this?

2201
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,670
The range is not that far.

2202
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,470
Which I've noticed.

2203
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:40,030
Yeah.

2204
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:41,170
This is like a...

2205
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:41,750
Yeah.

2206
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:42,890
This is like a spider.

2207
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:44,250
Okay.

2208
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:44,630
And then...

2209
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:47,730
I can deploy a drone here with me.

2210
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:50,570
What's the cooldown for my shield?

2211
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,330
Did I use it?

2212
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,110
Okay.

2213
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:55,430
I did.

2214
01:15:59,440 --> 01:15:59,900
Okay.

2215
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:00,540
Oh!

2216
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:01,480
So like...

2217
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,240
I can do like...

2218
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,200
Triple snipers.

2219
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:03,640
Basically.

2220
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:06,720
Okay.

2221
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,380
I get it.

2222
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,940
So I can do like...

2223
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,780
Something like...

2224
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:10,740
This.

2225
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,120
And then...

2226
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,320
And then have like...

2227
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,300
Three hits.

2228
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,040
Type deal.

2229
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,300
Okay.

2230
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,340
I can charge it?

2231
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:24,620
Oh!

2232
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:25,980
Nice.

2233
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:26,400
Okay.

2234
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,260
That's good to know.

2235
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:28,760
And then...

2236
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,740
I wanna try...

2237
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,140
I think the grapple is like...

2238
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:35,980
Pretty short though.

2239
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:36,360
Okay.

2240
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,580
I wanna try grappling him.

2241
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:41,900
Okay.

2242
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,660
So apparently I can stagger him.

2243
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,470
Oh my god.

2244
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:49,750
Okay.

2245
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:50,530
I might...

2246
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,450
I happen to have a higher sense for that.

2247
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:55,750
Alright.

2248
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:56,770
I get it now.

2249
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:57,490
Okay.

2250
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:59,570
I need a really high sense for...

2251
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:01,250
To like do like...

2252
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,450
To like 180 that.

2253
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:04,450
So that's the issue.

2254
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:06,390
Alright.

2255
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:07,170
Let's try this.

2256
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,870
Uh...

2257
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:12,030
Alright.

2258
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:13,550
Let's try 3v3.

2259
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,050
See how that goes.

2260
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:16,070
Let's see how...

2261
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,970
How much I'm gonna get shit on right now.

2262
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:18,570
Hahaha.

2263
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:20,810
Hahaha.

2264
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:23,670
I don't know.

2265
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:24,550
To be fair.

2266
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:26,550
I honestly just wanna try the...

2267
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:27,590
The hero shooter.

2268
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:28,710
And the...

2269
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,850
Um...

2270
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:30,710
And the deathmash.

2271
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:31,730
Uh...

2272
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,250
I'm not...

2273
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,330
For me personally.

2274
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,210
I'm not an extraction shooter player.

2275
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:36,630
So like for me.

2276
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:39,150
I think after trying that once on tutorial.

2277
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:40,930
That was like enough for me.

2278
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:41,810
IMO.

2279
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,450
Just cause I'm not an extraction shooter.

2280
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:44,630
Uh...

2281
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:44,830
I...

2282
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:46,670
I'm not like a huge fan of extraction shooters.

2283
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,390
Like I'm fine with...

2284
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:48,790
I like...

2285
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,050
I like the hero shooter mode.

2286
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:57,850
And also the, uh, and also the, uh, well, I haven't tried deathmatch yet, but I do like the hero shooter mode.

2287
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,610
I'll do one more extraction shooter just to see...

2288
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:07,390
Uh...

2289
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,770
Q sniped where- oh, I was like, what?

2290
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:19,890
Alright.

2291
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,010
If you're a big fan, please support and pocket me.

2292
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,990
If you're a fan, please support right now.

2293
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:35,930
And pocket me.

2294
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:38,110
That's right.

2295
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,710
Come on!

2296
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:39,310
Swap!

2297
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:40,230
Come on!

2298
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:41,530
Swap!

2299
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:43,490
Uh...

2300
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,270
Liar.

2301
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:46,190
A fucking liar.

2302
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,850
Not big enough, exactly.

2303
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:55,030
Not big enough fan, apparently.

2304
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:56,590
Liar.

2305
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:03,220
Pocket the squishy, invisible sniper.

2306
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:07,750
Guys, if you pocket me, I will- I'll be a tanky sniper.

2307
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,710
No, you can't swap.

2308
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:12,190
There is a swap button.

2309
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:12,850
They're lying.

2310
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:16,670
I saw- you can like press cancel and swap characters.

2311
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:21,710
They tried to lie to me.

2312
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,170
I saw the cancel button.

2313
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,760
Alright, here we go.

2314
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,240
Okay, not gonna lie.

2315
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,660
Why does this robot look like- A little high.

2316
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,620
How do we do 3v3?

2317
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,620
Destroy all enemy units and claim victory.

2318
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:45,760
Okay.

2319
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:47,880
Wow!

2320
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:52,440
Wow!

2321
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,920
Oh my god.

2322
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,560
Where is he?

2323
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,000
Where is he?

2324
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,360
I'm scared.

2325
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,640
Okay, nice.

2326
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:15,140
I'm helping.

2327
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,360
I'm helping?

2328
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:20,840
Oh, I'm- I'm helping.

2329
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,720
Ha ha!

2330
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:24,940
That's right!

2331
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,480
Okay.

2332
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:28,680
I'm gaming.

2333
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,840
I'm scared though.

2334
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:40,980
Oh.

2335
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,860
Oh wait, they're- Ha ha ha ha!

2336
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,460
Okay.

2337
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,660
Okay, we need our- get our drone.

2338
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,500
That's stupid!

2339
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:57,620
That's fine.

2340
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,720
That's fine.

2341
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,200
Oh shit, it's not fine.

2342
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,620
Everybody's playing that plane, guy.

2343
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,880
Wait, there's somebody also sniping!

2344
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:19,360
Oh shit!

2345
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:22,740
Oh no.

2346
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,900
Oh my god, he's also sniping.

2347
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,080
I'm so low.

2348
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,440
Wait, I'm not the only sniper.

2349
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,420
Don't worry, I'm helping.

2350
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,000
Don't worry, I'm helping!

2351
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,780
Oh my god, he might kill me though.

2352
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,680
Ha ha ha ha!

2353
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,300
Oh no.

2354
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,760
I'm okay.

2355
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,400
It's fine, it's fine, I'm okay.

2356
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:05,840
Oh shit!

2357
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,920
I'm deploying drone!

2358
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:09,900
Wait.

2359
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,280
Oh my god.

2360
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:18,010
Oh, I have to actually focus so much.

2361
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:21,410
I'm- I actually have to focus!

2362
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,430
Holy shit!

2363
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:27,950
Jesus Christ, I actually have to think.

2364
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,490
I actually have to think while playing this game.

2365
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,370
Ha ha ha ha!

2366
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:33,150
Oh!

2367
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:33,230
Oh!

2368
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:39,350
Oh!

2369
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:40,950
Like I actually have to like...

2370
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:42,150
Oh my god.

2371
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:44,650
I can't like- Oh no!

2372
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:45,510
No, no, no, no, no!

2373
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:46,730
No!

2374
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:51,850
He got- He neutralized me!

2375
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:58,290
Oh, I can't- I can't like- I have to like think so much when I play here.

2376
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,270
Holy fuck, I actually have to think so much though.

2377
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:09,350
Like I'm- I'm trying so hard to focus concentrate.

2378
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,260
Guys...

2379
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,260
I have to be careful because I'm like super squishy too.

2380
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:24,680
Okay.

2381
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,360
Nice.

2382
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,300
He's one.

2383
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:28,460
Oh!

2384
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:31,340
Oh!

2385
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:31,460
Oh!

2386
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,920
I think these are real people.

2387
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,720
They play pretty smart.

2388
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,480
Okay.

2389
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:38,960
She's fun.

2390
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:39,540
I like her.

2391
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,560
I think I like this person- this character.

2392
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,740
I definitely like her.

2393
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,540
It's time to execute!

2394
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,340
Ha ha ha ha!

2395
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,900
No one's gonna stop me!

2396
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,600
Ha ha ha!

2397
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,020
That's right!

2398
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,400
I execute that in front of all your teammates.

2399
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,880
I don't know if that did anything.

2400
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:11,290
Ooh!

2401
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:13,590
It's fine.

2402
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,510
Ha ha ha!

2403
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:21,210
Wait.

2404
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:21,990
Oh shit!

2405
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:22,630
What did he do?

2406
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:25,610
I don't know what that does.

2407
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:28,710
Oh my god.

2408
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:29,490
I don't know what he's doing.

2409
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:32,830
Oh, I'm- Oh my god.

2410
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:33,750
I'm so low.

2411
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:40,210
I need one more.

2412
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:41,110
He's so low.

2413
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,450
Come on!

2414
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:45,960
Ha ha!

2415
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,520
He's so low!

2416
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,080
Yes!

2417
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:51,260
A new kill!

2418
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,280
Yes!

2419
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:01,300
Okay.

2420
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,580
That was fun.

2421
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,020
Okay.

2422
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,160
I like Light Sniper.

2423
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,580
I like, uh...

2424
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,160
I like Light Sniper.

2425
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,180
I don't think I got MVP.

2426
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,620
But I got some cool ass- Yeah.

2427
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:16,300
I-I don't think I got MVP, but- Oh, I did!

2428
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,760
I did get MVP!

2429
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,400
Let's go!

2430
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,860
Let's go!

2431
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:22,020
Let's go!

2432
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,140
Fuck yeah!

2433
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,660
Fuck yeah!

2434
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,100
I was goddamn dominating!

2435
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,160
Ha ha ha!

2436
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,940
That's right!

2437
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,880
That was me!

2438
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,940
Okay, I like- I like this character.

2439
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,120
I like Narukami.

2440
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,600
I think Narukami is really fun.

2441
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,480
That's right.

2442
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,120
It must be like really fun, cause she's on camo too, a lot.

2443
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:54,720
Especially like, when you have all the drones out.

2444
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,220
I think- Right now, I only tried three characters.

2445
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,200
But, Narukami for me was definitely really fun.

2446
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,420
I-I enjoyed it a lot.

2447
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,780
Alright, I wanna try her.

2448
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,780
I wanna try her in a...

2449
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,000
5v5.

2450
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:11,420
Uh...

2451
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:13,100
Honestly- I-I-I-It was so fun!

2452
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,020
I just love her movement.

2453
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,180
Her movement- Uh...

2454
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:16,980
Uh...

2455
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,780
Her movement was crazy.

2456
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,040
Uh...

2457
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,540
That's why- I-I don't know.

2458
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:22,460
That's why I enjoyed it a lot.

2459
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:25,360
Because her movement was- Uh...

2460
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:25,640
Uh...

2461
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,880
Was really crazy.

2462
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,220
And her drones- Yeah, her drones can shoot through walls.

2463
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,080
Which was like, you know, not fair.

2464
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,020
Ha ha ha!

2465
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,180
Ha ha ha!

2466
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,440
Ha ha ha!

2467
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:40,540
Like her- Her drones were- The fact that her drones can shoot through walls was crazy.

2468
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:44,080
Because it's like, you know, as long- If I know where you are.

2469
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:46,600
Uh...

2470
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,240
Uh...

2471
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,180
If I know where- Yeah, if I know where you are, then like, you're fucked basically.

2472
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:53,940
Tricera!

2473
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,320
Ready to strike.

2474
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,300
Okay.

2475
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,160
Am I the only- Ready to strike.

2476
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,340
Oh, I'm the only sniper.

2477
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:00,960
Stego!

2478
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,320
Ready to strike.

2479
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,760
Yeah, I think her camo is still broken.

2480
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:05,520
Not gonna lie.

2481
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:06,900
Ready to strike.

2482
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,800
A Focus Falcon counters her though, cause he can scan her.

2483
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:17,080
Yeah, I feel like- If you know the enemy team has a- Narukami, you have to play something that can scan her.

2484
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,600
Or like, it's just not gonna be fun at all.

2485
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:26,160
Cause like, I- cause like, I assumed because I had so many of my drones out, that it was just really difficult to find me.

2486
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,080
That's why I feel like she's so broken.

2487
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,520
Oh, Narukami is the worst mecha, but she herself is so broken.

2488
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,440
I feel like if you can- I feel like she's not good when you're playing against experienced players.

2489
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:47,180
Because right now, a lot of people don't really know how to play against Narukami.

2490
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:47,740
Narukami?

2491
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,180
Because of how, um...

2492
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:52,400
Um...

2493
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,140
Because like, they're not used to playing against a stealth character.

2494
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,720
But I think if I play against experienced players, people will counter her more.

2495
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:02,500
Yeah, I just can't stay still.

2496
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,200
I just have to like, move around a lot, in general.

2497
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,780
Yeah, it's me!

2498
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,400
Yeah, it's me!

2499
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,060
Alright, I'll try- I'll try out Panther next.

2500
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:34,610
Okay.

2501
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:36,350
Come on.

2502
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:44,530
Which one's me?

2503
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,410
Yeah, just let me do everything I want.

2504
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:49,970
Yeah, just let me do it.

2505
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:51,050
Come on.

2506
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:53,810
Oh shit!

2507
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:54,630
Okay, nevermind.

2508
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:02,290
Okay.

2509
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:07,950
Oh, he's moving a lot.

2510
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:09,990
Oh, this guy's moving so much.

2511
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:11,790
I'll charge it up more.

2512
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:16,640
Nice.

2513
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,200
Okay, we got...

2514
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,600
They're all like, heading over now.

2515
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:21,880
Okay.

2516
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,160
Aww.

2517
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,080
Whoa.

2518
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,000
Get out of here.

2519
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,340
Okay, we gotta go to...

2520
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:41,680
We gotta go to...

2521
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:42,540
Get the...

2522
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:42,920
Extractor.

2523
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:49,290
Oh, come on.

2524
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:50,490
He's so low.

2525
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,750
Haha, that's right!

2526
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,470
Alright.

2527
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:56,510
Okay.

2528
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,650
Nice.

2529
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,830
I'm trying to like...

2530
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:01,450
Run around a lot.

2531
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:02,790
Like, move around a lot.

2532
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:05,230
Okay.

2533
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:05,930
That's fine.

2534
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,130
I'll get him.

2535
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,450
That's right!

2536
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:13,610
I got my drone out!

2537
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:14,670
That's fucking right!

2538
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,680
I'm trying to move around a lot.

2539
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,060
So they don't know which one's me.

2540
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:27,640
Okay, nice.

2541
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,220
What's that?

2542
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,320
Haha, I don't know what I destroyed.

2543
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:35,620
Don't worry, I'm helping.

2544
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:37,420
Nice.

2545
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,820
Don't worry, I'm deploying shit.

2546
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,140
They don't know.

2547
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:43,840
He he he.

2548
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:44,860
I'm a little spider.

2549
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,260
He he he.

2550
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,640
Guys, I think they know I'm here now.

2551
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,380
They don't know.

2552
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:55,880
Look at me.

2553
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,700
I'm a little spider.

2554
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:57,280
No, come on.

2555
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:58,640
Just...

2556
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,120
Come on!

2557
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:00,600
Just move to the left!

2558
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:01,860
A little bit!

2559
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,140
Just a little bit to the left!

2560
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:04,840
Please!

2561
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:05,600
I'm stuck!

2562
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,420
Okay, whatever.

2563
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:07,080
Alright.

2564
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,400
That's fine.

2565
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:14,460
That's fine.

2566
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,500
Wait, how did I score 21?

2567
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,180
Wait, what?

2568
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,660
Wait, I don't understand!

2569
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,520
What happened?

2570
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,580
Oh my god, I don't know how the point system works for this.

2571
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:38,780
I don't know.

2572
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,120
I should have helped.

2573
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,980
I should have.

2574
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,220
Whoops.

2575
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,680
Please, where's my teammate?

2576
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,640
Oh shit!

2577
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:57,160
Okay, that's fine.

2578
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,580
Where did my teammate go?

2579
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,020
Okay.

2580
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:04,340
That's fine.

2581
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,000
Oh my god.

2582
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,720
My teammates are not...

2583
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,160
Oh, it's like capping!

2584
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:11,860
Okay.

2585
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:12,920
I'm dumb.

2586
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,080
Alright, it's fine.

2587
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,340
I need to grab, put my drone...

2588
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:22,160
There we go.

2589
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:23,580
There we go.

2590
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,260
I got a kill.

2591
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:26,500
It's fine.

2592
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,540
I don't have time to execute.

2593
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:34,110
Okay, there's a guy right here though.

2594
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,490
Okay.

2595
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:38,390
Come on.

2596
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:43,160
No more.

2597
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:43,920
No, no, no, no!

2598
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:44,340
He's won!

2599
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,020
Come on!

2600
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:45,400
He's won!

2601
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:45,760
Nice!

2602
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,060
Okay, I wanted to kill this guy.

2603
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,120
Can we get the objective?

2604
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:51,840
Fuck!

2605
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,220
There we go.

2606
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,680
That should make him stagger, right?

2607
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,680
Wait, how come he didn't get staggered?

2608
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,100
It's staggered!

2609
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,240
Oh my god.

2610
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,700
Team, I need help!

2611
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:13,440
Okay.

2612
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,340
That's fine.

2613
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:20,080
Bro, what the fuck is that?

2614
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,960
Like, why does he do so much damage?

2615
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:30,180
Jesus Christ, he does so much!

2616
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:32,230
He's so tanky!

2617
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,060
He does so much.

2618
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,480
Holy fuck.

2619
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:51,900
Okay, nice.

2620
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:55,560
Nice, we got it.

2621
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,080
I'm heading in, I'm heading in!

2622
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:08,690
Okay, I want to try and get...

2623
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:10,190
I think I got staggered there, but I'm not sure.

2624
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:12,830
Oh!

2625
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,120
Haha, you don't know which one's me!

2626
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:20,100
Hahaha!

2627
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,200
Oh shit!

2628
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,460
I don't know.

2629
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,260
I don't know which one's me, though.

2630
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,220
Oh my god.

2631
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,780
Oh shit, I didn't know what...

2632
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:39,760
I didn't want to do that!

2633
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:40,420
Fuck!

2634
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:45,940
My...

2635
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,160
Oh!

2636
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:50,460
I have to move so much!

2637
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:51,500
Please!

2638
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:55,960
Oh no.

2639
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,040
I'm so concerned.

2640
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,380
Where's my team?

2641
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,040
Hahaha!

2642
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,300
Wait, how do I get out of here?

2643
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,360
Hahaha!

2644
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:11,340
Get out!

2645
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:13,280
Okay, I'm getting out.

2646
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,000
Don't worry team!

2647
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:14,820
I'm coming back!

2648
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:16,780
I think!

2649
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,360
Oh, why can't I see anything?

2650
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,040
Am I dying?

2651
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,540
I can't...

2652
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:31,760
What's going on?

2653
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:33,840
Am I dying?

2654
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,180
I can't see anything!

2655
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:40,130
Okay.

2656
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:41,570
Ah!

2657
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,660
I'm being spryed!

2658
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:46,720
I can't see anything!

2659
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:58,900
Who's me?

2660
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,520
Which was my team?

2661
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:02,640
I...

2662
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,760
I can't tell!

2663
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:05,180
Hahaha!

2664
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,500
I can't tell!

2665
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:11,880
I couldn't tell who was my team and who wasn't!

2666
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:18,670
Oh my god, he jumped.

2667
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:19,230
Of course he did.

2668
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:22,970
Hahaha!

2669
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:23,030
Hahaha!

2670
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,850
Oh, he's so fucked.

2671
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:30,110
He's so fucked, no.

2672
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,730
Hahaha!

2673
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:35,530
Okay.

2674
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:36,350
Nice.

2675
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,450
There we go, I staggered him.

2676
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:42,890
Get him!

2677
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:43,570
Get the panther!

2678
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,600
Hahaha!

2679
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:50,600
You can't tell!

2680
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,160
That's right, you're so disoriented!

2681
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,120
Hahaha!

2682
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,580
I fucked around!

2683
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:08,800
Hahaha!

2684
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,160
I actually fucked around!

2685
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:11,220
Hahaha!

2686
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:14,240
Yay!

2687
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:15,240
Hey!

2688
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:15,980
Okay.

2689
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:17,840
Yeah, he can tell.

2690
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,220
Okay.

2691
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:25,840
Yay!

2692
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:26,900
Seven assists!

2693
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:31,280
Holy shit!

2694
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,760
Okay, I like her the most.

2695
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,780
Alright, who do you guys want me to try next?

2696
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,140
Yeah, I don't think I got MVP'd there.

2697
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:38,760
Hahaha!

2698
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,660
I mean, I got five kills!

2699
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:44,100
She had two kills more than me, in the end.

2700
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:47,820
Did I get anything?

2701
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:49,280
Top Assault.

2702
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:53,380
Wait, does that mean- Holy shit!

2703
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:58,940
Bro, this- there's a guy, below me, that has like- that took a million damage.

2704
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:02,900
Like, what- Wait, what does like, top Assault mean?

2705
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,280
Does that mean I did the most damage?

2706
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:05,300
Chat?

2707
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,260
Is that what it means?

2708
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,340
Is it that I did the most damage?

2709
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:14,860
There's a guy that got taken a million damage, and he's like, the heavy brother.

2710
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:15,660
Yeah.

2711
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,220
Most damage- Yeah!

2712
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,320
I did the most damage!

2713
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,220
Let's go!

2714
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,060
Yeah, that's me!

2715
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:22,780
Okay, that's fun.

2716
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:29,380
I like- I think- I not only tried three characters, but- the Nur- uh, the Nurkami guy is definitely my favorite so far.

2717
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,660
Uh, but yeah, guys!

2718
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:33,320
If you do exclamation point mecha, you can check out the game right now.

2719
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:34,260
It is free to play.

2720
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:38,760
And there's, um, twelve different classes that you can play right now on the launch day.

2721
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:40,800
Yay!

2722
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,560
Top damage!

2723
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,140
That's me!

2724
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:46,950
Alright.

2725
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:49,890
Okay, I saw Panther and I saw Falcon.

2726
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:51,370
Is there anything else you guys want me to try?

2727
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:52,790
Also, we have drops!

2728
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:59,070
So, um, if you watch my stream right now, you have a chance to get, uh, these- Okay, let me see.

2729
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:00,170
These drops!

2730
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:00,830
For free!

2731
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:01,670
So, yeah!

2732
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,990
And we have Twitch drops right now.

2733
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:06,730
So, you guys really want to get some free cosmetics, just watch the stream!

2734
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:08,690
Uh...

2735
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:13,770
Am I, like, Panther's playstyle?

2736
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:14,930
Okay, I'll try Panther.

2737
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:16,410
Alright.

2738
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:17,490
Oh, wait, that's not Panther.

2739
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:19,490
Okay.

2740
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:20,490
The brawler.

2741
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:23,210
Okay, so he's the- He's a melee character, I remember.

2742
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:26,030
So, I'll do- I'll try him in 3v3.

2743
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:27,570
Is he good for 3v3 or nah?

2744
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:31,450
Alright, let's try.

2745
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,100
Falcon will suit me?

2746
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:44,740
Okay, we'll try Falcon after this, too.

2747
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:51,440
Alright.

2748
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,440
Let's try Panther out and see what his abilities are.

2749
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:56,860
Great mobility?

2750
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:57,660
Okay.

2751
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,200
Let's try it out.

2752
01:39:59,480 --> 01:39:59,500
Let's try it out.

2753
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:00,880
I like the mobile characters.

2754
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,080
I don't think you guys can tell from Nurikami.

2755
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,320
I was, like, basically moving everywhere and it was, like, super disoriented.

2756
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:08,760
Okay.

2757
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:09,140
Okay.

2758
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:09,340
Lance.

2759
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,740
Knocks back.

2760
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,980
Dealing physical damage that pass-pies hold the charge.

2761
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,980
Increases damage and thrust range.

2762
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,200
Blocks all frontal attacks.

2763
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,140
Shield regen stops when activated.

2764
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,060
Parrys melee attacks and staggers the attacker within- Okay, so this parrys.

2765
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,200
Shield blade.

2766
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:31,560
Switches side-on to induce short, which bypasses dealing physical damage while staggering.

2767
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:36,180
Performs an unparable downward slash when targeting low attitude.

2768
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,560
Okay, so...

2769
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:42,340
And then boot immediately and partially restores energy.

2770
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:43,220
Three.

2771
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:48,140
An additional shield that blocks attack from all damages.

2772
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,420
Shield regen stops when activated.

2773
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:51,640
Okay.

2774
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,140
Useable during immobilization and stagger.

2775
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,240
So I assume that's what he did.

2776
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:00,520
Um...

2777
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:02,880
Press to initiate a boost attack.

2778
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:06,320
Okay, I assume that's what that guy did to me last time.

2779
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,180
Okay.

2780
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:08,280
So...

2781
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,360
Let's try this out.

2782
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:11,760
Okay.

2783
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:14,820
Um...

2784
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:20,730
Ooh!

2785
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:22,730
Okay, so that's the charge.

2786
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:23,970
And then...

2787
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:31,220
Wait, where's the...

2788
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,280
Wait, what's the other one?

2789
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,020
One...

2790
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:40,740
Okay.

2791
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:41,560
Oh!

2792
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:42,580
It was this.

2793
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:43,680
It was the right click.

2794
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:44,740
Okay.

2795
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,160
That's what he did.

2796
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:46,960
That was scary.

2797
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,800
Oh, he charged lands me?

2798
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:51,960
Okay.

2799
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,560
Yeah, that shit was scary.

2800
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:54,040
Okay.

2801
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,800
Okay, and then...

2802
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,580
This is the shield where I can parry people, basically.

2803
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:01,060
And then...

2804
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,780
And then this is the shield regen.

2805
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,480
And this is where I like block everybody.

2806
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:06,760
Alright.

2807
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:11,680
Emily restores energy and reinforce...

2808
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,600
What's the cooldown for it?

2809
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:13,920
Okay, the cooldown is not that bad.

2810
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:18,140
Okay.

2811
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:20,740
I have to be like...

2812
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:22,660
I have to get super close though.

2813
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:23,400
Into him.

2814
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:24,840
Can I do this?

2815
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:26,100
Can I charge this up?

2816
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,280
When I'm flying?

2817
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:29,540
Ooh...

2818
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,200
Wait, I can charge this when I'm flying.

2819
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,020
Wait, that's really good.

2820
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:34,900
Oh, yeah.

2821
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,160
You can charge this.

2822
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:37,540
Have...

2823
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:38,700
You press charge first.

2824
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:40,120
And then you...

2825
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,720
You can fly around with it.

2826
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,160
Yeah, and then if I do that...

2827
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,760
And I can get my energy back.

2828
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:47,520
And then do that.

2829
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,160
Yeah, okay.

2830
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,560
So I can keep the juices going.

2831
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:54,780
Yeah, and it doesn't waste...

2832
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:54,960
Okay.

2833
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,000
We'll try it.

2834
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,220
Alright, let's try Panther out.

2835
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,460
Let's try him 3-3.

2836
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,620
Training complete.

2837
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,800
So he's like basically a diver.

2838
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,520
So like actual Panther, Panther.

2839
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,920
That's why like I was like when...

2840
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,560
I saw the name.

2841
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,480
I was like, oh, Panther.

2842
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,140
It has to be like a dive character.

2843
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,080
Like why else...

2844
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,940
Why the fuck else would it be named Panther?

2845
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,020
I was like...

2846
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,360
I don't know how to parry, guys.

2847
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,720
That's why I play Sniper.

2848
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:24,860
Guys...

2849
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:26,420
You think I know how to...

2850
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:28,060
I don't even parry...

2851
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,280
In other games.

2852
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,860
You think I know how to parry...

2853
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:32,780
In this one?

2854
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,940
Oh my god, there's Mega Man.

2855
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:37,620
Oh my god.

2856
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,660
What's he doing here?

2857
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,080
Alright, I'm ready.

2858
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,100
What's that?

2859
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:51,700
Yeah, parry?

2860
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,300
What's that?

2861
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:56,810
It is?

2862
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:58,410
I don't know how the attacks...

2863
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:00,710
To be fair, I don't know what the pattern attacks...

2864
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:01,590
In this game yet.

2865
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:03,190
Um...

2866
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:04,710
Because like, you know, I just started playing.

2867
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:07,590
So I don't know what the parry attacks actually look like.

2868
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:15,630
Alright, here I go.

2869
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:17,430
Woo!

2870
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,080
Let's go, I'm ready.

2871
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:25,140
Okay.

2872
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,760
And then we'll try Falcon next.

2873
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,240
What is Falcon's abilities?

2874
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:29,120
Let's do this.

2875
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:29,700
Like, what it...

2876
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,640
What are they normally?

2877
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:34,120
Okay.

2878
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,260
What is this map?

2879
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:44,470
Hello Mega Man.

2880
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:45,250
Oh my god.

2881
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:47,130
He's already shooting.

2882
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:51,310
Don't worry, we got this.

2883
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:52,390
We slowly move up.

2884
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:53,870
Where's...

2885
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:55,030
Are they just like...

2886
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:56,930
The coward.

2887
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:58,810
Holy shit.

2888
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:01,110
Actual cowards.

2889
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:05,550
Oh my god.

2890
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:06,310
Wait, he par...

2891
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:07,350
Wait, what?

2892
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:10,210
Oh my god.

2893
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:13,350
I was not expecting that from him.

2894
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:15,750
Come on.

2895
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:16,350
Oh ho ho ho.

2896
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:19,390
Holy shit.

2897
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:20,410
I was not expecting that.

2898
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:25,170
Come on.

2899
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:25,810
Get over here.

2900
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:27,170
Come on.

2901
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:29,530
Oh my god.

2902
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:29,950
What?

2903
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:31,970
I got baited.

2904
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:33,990
Oh my god.

2905
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:34,590
I got baited.

2906
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:35,890
I got baited so...

2907
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:42,940
I got baited.

2908
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,320
I'm so sad.

2909
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,540
My teammates ran away!

2910
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:47,580
Yay!

2911
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:53,040
I swear I swapped to play.

2912
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:55,320
I can't believe it.

2913
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,080
My teammates ran away.

2914
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,300
I'm so sad.

2915
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,160
He was one!

2916
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,660
Oh my god.

2917
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,360
This is hard.

2918
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,220
I'm not good at Panther.

2919
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:14,760
I'm just not good at melee, I feel like.

2920
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,940
I think melee is just difficult for me.

2921
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:22,890
Are you serious?

2922
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:23,470
Wait, what?

2923
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:25,090
Wait, is that the parry?

2924
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:27,310
Okay.

2925
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:30,130
Oh my god.

2926
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:31,010
I'm so bad at melee.

2927
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:38,170
Okay.

2928
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:39,050
Oh shit.

2929
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:40,710
Oh my god.

2930
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:41,310
Get me out of here.

2931
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:42,110
Get me out of here.

2932
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:43,510
Get me out of here.

2933
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:44,830
Jesus Christ.

2934
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:45,630
Get me out of here.

2935
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:48,530
Okay.

2936
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:51,550
Jesus Christ.

2937
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:52,890
Oh my god.

2938
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:54,210
What is going on?

2939
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:55,650
Guys.

2940
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:56,870
I think I found out.

2941
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:59,230
I'm not meant to play.

2942
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:03,610
I am definitely not meant to play.

2943
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:06,150
Meant to play.

2944
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:07,010
Melee.

2945
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:10,110
I'm not meant to play.

2946
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,330
I'm not good at it.

2947
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:19,170
I am definitely not good at melee, guys.

2948
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:23,050
Jesus Christ.

2949
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:23,790
This is so dope.

2950
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:27,110
Okay.

2951
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:30,530
Alright.

2952
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:34,510
Here we go.

2953
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:36,010
What?

2954
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:43,180
Wait, where did he go?

2955
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:47,220
What the fuck happened?

2956
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,600
What the fuck happened?

2957
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,080
Oh, he had on?

2958
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,220
I'm so confused.

2959
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:06,700
That was so confusing.

2960
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:12,850
Oh, I'm so fucking confused.

2961
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:16,650
Holy fuck.

2962
01:48:20,630 --> 01:48:22,010
Oh my god.

2963
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:24,910
These guys actually have a comp, too.

2964
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:28,570
Like, I can't see people.

2965
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:31,510
Is that my teammate or no?

2966
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:35,430
How do I get out of Paul's arm?

2967
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:36,010
Guys.

2968
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:38,950
Oh my god.

2969
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:39,390
There he is.

2970
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:41,990
Oh my god.

2971
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:43,210
Jesus Christ!

2972
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:47,630
Holy fuck, please!

2973
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:49,190
No.

2974
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:53,170
No way!

2975
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:58,000
Oh, it's time-based?

2976
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:00,760
Wait, is the game too loud, chat?

2977
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,080
Wait, has the...

2978
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,220
Has the...

2979
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,500
It's like, uh...

2980
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,620
Wait, has the game been too loud?

2981
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:10,700
Oh, no?

2982
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:11,740
Oh, okay.

2983
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,820
Someone was like, the game is so loud.

2984
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:16,820
Okay.

2985
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,460
I don't like Panther.

2986
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:19,540
I don't like him.

2987
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,740
I'm not a Melee kid.

2988
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,440
I think I found out...

2989
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,420
That...

2990
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,060
I'm not a Melee player.

2991
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:30,800
I don't understand Melee.

2992
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,540
I don't...

2993
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:36,120
No, I definitely don't understand Melee.

2994
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:42,600
How do I change?

2995
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:44,800
I can change characters?

2996
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:47,830
Yeah, I'm definitely...

2997
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:49,640
What I noticed for me...

2998
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,790
Is that I'm definitely...

2999
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:53,440
Um...

3000
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,900
I'm definitely a Melee...

3001
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,620
Uh, uh...

3002
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:55,980
Shooter.

3003
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:59,940
Yeah, I've never been good at Melee characters.

3004
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,780
I'm like, definitely...

3005
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:03,540
I'm feeding so much too.

3006
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:04,840
Which I feel bad.

3007
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,680
I feel bad.

3008
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,420
Oh my god!

3009
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:13,080
I'm like...

3010
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,580
I think my movement's good.

3011
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:15,620
But...

3012
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:18,660
I'm definitely like, not good at...

3013
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,760
I'm definitely not good at...

3014
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,280
Moving around.

3015
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:25,040
Or like, uh...

3016
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:27,850
I'm not good at...

3017
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,460
Uh...

3018
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,440
Using my Melee, in general.

3019
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:33,560
Uh...

3020
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:35,920
My movement's good.

3021
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,520
I think my movement's decent.

3022
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:39,760
I'm just not good at...

3023
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,040
Yeah.

3024
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:54,300
Yeah, I think like, for me...

3025
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,500
For me...

3026
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:58,160
Um...

3027
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,640
I definitely need to like...

3028
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:00,180
Learn...

3029
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:01,240
I think for me...

3030
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,440
For...

3031
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,540
Oh my god...

3032
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:03,960
20...

3033
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:04,340
What?

3034
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,280
Oh, 20 kill...

3035
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:05,780
Total kills.

3036
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,080
For me...

3037
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,140
It's definitely like...

3038
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:09,700
You...

3039
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,400
Panther seems to be like...

3040
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,180
More...

3041
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:14,080
More skill involved...

3042
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:14,740
In terms of like...

3043
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:15,520
Learning his mechanics.

3044
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,680
But like...

3045
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:17,600
As someone that...

3046
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:18,580
Is not very good...

3047
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:19,320
At Melee characters...

3048
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:20,260
In general...

3049
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:21,700
In any game...

3050
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:22,180
Um...

3051
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,120
He is...

3052
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:27,680
So weird.

3053
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:28,760
He is such a...

3054
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,280
He's...

3055
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,700
His playstyle is...

3056
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:31,700
So hard...

3057
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:32,500
To...

3058
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,280
To figure out.

3059
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,900
I'm just better at...

3060
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:38,960
I'm better at movement...

3061
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:39,940
Movement for...

3062
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:40,400
Shooting.

3063
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:42,140
Or movement shooters in general.

3064
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,780
Is this movement or...

3065
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:45,860
Aerial combat?

3066
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,520
Alright.

3067
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:49,600
What is this?

3068
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,720
What are her abilities?

3069
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:51,880
Alright.

3070
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:52,720
Let's try her out.

3071
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:53,240
But yeah.

3072
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,740
Definitely no panther for me.

3073
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,020
Panther was miserable.

3074
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,380
Panther was...

3075
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:05,400
So...

3076
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:05,740
Miser...

3077
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:07,200
Miserable to play.

3078
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:12,130
Oh!

3079
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:13,230
Is this a fighter jet?

3080
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:15,230
Was this a fighter jet?

3081
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:16,050
Where I kept like...

3082
01:52:17,490 --> 01:52:17,970
Um...

3083
01:52:17,970 --> 01:52:19,170
Where I just kept flying around?

3084
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:21,350
Like where he just...

3085
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,510
Yeah.

3086
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:21,810
Yeah.

3087
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:22,270
This is...

3088
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:23,470
No, wait.

3089
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:24,230
No, it wasn't.

3090
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:24,530
Okay.

3091
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:26,210
I thought this was the fly...

3092
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:26,850
The flyer.

3093
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:27,730
No.

3094
01:52:27,870 --> 01:52:28,610
He was actually...

3095
01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:30,310
In the actual plane when I saw him.

3096
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:31,790
Okay.

3097
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:33,250
Target required.

3098
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:35,610
Okay.

3099
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:36,350
So he's like...

3100
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:37,710
He seems to be doing post...

3101
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:38,490
Damage.

3102
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:40,970
Frecon...

3103
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:43,150
Fires at locked targets.

3104
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:44,510
Winged form.

3105
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:45,510
Fires...

3106
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:47,410
Dealing ballistic damage.

3107
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:49,250
Winged form.

3108
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:50,470
Heavy missiles.

3109
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:50,650
He does.

3110
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:51,090
Okay.

3111
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:53,030
Okay.

3112
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:54,370
So...

3113
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:57,110
Oh!

3114
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:57,590
It is!

3115
01:52:57,730 --> 01:52:57,890
Oh!

3116
01:52:57,990 --> 01:52:58,390
It is!

3117
01:52:58,610 --> 01:52:59,770
It is the playing guy.

3118
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:00,190
Okay.

3119
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:01,950
How do I...

3120
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:04,530
Okay.

3121
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,750
But how do I use the...

3122
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:06,610
The right click?

3123
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:07,750
Oh no.

3124
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:08,230
That's that.

3125
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:08,650
Nevermind.

3126
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:09,330
I'm...

3127
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:09,550
JK.

3128
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:10,050
I'm dumb.

3129
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:10,710
Alright.

3130
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:12,150
She seems really easy.

3131
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:15,030
This is Tracer.

3132
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:17,090
I assume she has to be like...

3133
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:17,890
Super...

3134
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:18,490
Fast.

3135
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:19,210
Right?

3136
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:20,050
Alright.

3137
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:20,750
We'll try...

3138
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:21,730
Is she good on arena?

3139
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:22,990
Or is she bad on arena?

3140
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:23,650
Guys.

3141
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:26,450
Good or bad in arena chat.

3142
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:39,130
Pretty bad?

3143
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:41,130
Bad I'd say?

3144
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:41,850
I'll...

3145
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:43,690
I'll try the hero shooter mode then.

3146
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:44,070
With her.

3147
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:46,370
Maybe she'll be decent on hero shooters.

3148
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:49,510
I have to stay in...

3149
01:53:50,370 --> 01:53:52,170
Just playing for him at all times?

3150
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:52,610
Okay.

3151
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:53,590
That's interesting.

3152
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:53,970
Okay.

3153
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:55,490
Alright.

3154
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:57,810
We'll try Falcon and then we'll go back to...

3155
01:53:57,810 --> 01:53:58,710
Uh...

3156
01:53:58,710 --> 01:53:59,410
Narukami.

3157
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,150
Cause...

3158
01:54:00,150 --> 01:54:00,810
She's my boo.

3159
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:02,010
She's my bae.

3160
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:05,910
Oh my god.

3161
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:07,690
That guy went from 11 deaths already.

3162
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:11,030
Wait.

3163
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:12,050
I don't wanna be...

3164
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:14,190
Wait.

3165
01:54:14,490 --> 01:54:14,750
Wait.

3166
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:15,430
They took Falcon.

3167
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,890
Wait.

3168
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:17,510
Wait a minute.

3169
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:20,170
Wait.

3170
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,370
Wait a minute.

3171
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:23,330
Wait a minute.

3172
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:23,450
Wait a minute.

3173
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:25,710
Wait a minute.

3174
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:28,010
It's not fair!

3175
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:30,890
WHAAAT?

3176
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:32,990
Wait wait, see I told you.

3177
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:33,950
You can literally swap.

3178
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:34,950
That guy was fucking lying!

3179
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:35,750
I told you guys.

3180
01:54:35,890 --> 01:54:37,770
I told you guys he was lying.

3181
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:40,650
I guess...

3182
01:54:41,230 --> 01:54:41,730
Narukami.

3183
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:43,010
I guess...

3184
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:43,650
I guess...

3185
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:48,330
I guess we play Narukami.

3186
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:52,270
Back to Narukami.

3187
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:55,850
If I wanted to play her in here, I wanna play Narukami in 3v3.

3188
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:57,370
I think 3v3v3...

3189
01:54:57,370 --> 01:54:58,550
It's more...

3190
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:01,270
It's more, um...

3191
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:01,950
What's the word?

3192
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:04,230
Um, it's more skill-based.

3193
01:55:08,350 --> 01:55:09,430
Alright, here I go.

3194
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:19,830
Alright, after this, we'll try...

3195
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,250
We'll try...

3196
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:22,650
Uh...

3197
01:55:22,650 --> 01:55:23,870
We'll actually try a falcon.

3198
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:27,910
Narukami!

3199
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:29,590
I'm coming down!

3200
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:30,710
Beep beep!

3201
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:37,270
I like how I'm trying different maps every time, though.

3202
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:41,130
I like that.

3203
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,800
I thought my drone, like, literally fell down.

3204
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:56,230
Wait, did he die already?

3205
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:01,190
Wait, where is he?

3206
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:05,510
Wouldn't it be funny if he actually died there?

3207
01:56:08,050 --> 01:56:09,070
Where is he?

3208
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:09,750
Holy shit.

3209
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:14,750
Oh my god, they're all flying.

3210
01:56:15,730 --> 01:56:16,290
Everybody...

3211
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:17,250
Oh, everybody...

3212
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:19,050
People are starting to outplay this game now.

3213
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:24,210
Come on!

3214
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:24,910
Hey!

3215
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:27,210
Goodbye!

3216
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:32,770
I don't think he knows.

3217
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,460
He's like, who's hitting me?

3218
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:44,580
Ah, shit!

3219
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:45,660
Ah, shit!

3220
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:46,180
Okay.

3221
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:50,960
Okay.

3222
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,460
He doesn't know.

3223
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:54,940
I can just stay up here.

3224
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,160
Where am I?

3225
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:03,940
Oh, shit!

3226
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:04,420
Oh, shit!

3227
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:04,940
Oh, shit!

3228
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,200
They're not letting me have fun!

3229
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:08,180
Hehehe.

3230
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:15,250
Oh, shit!

3231
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:15,910
Whoa!

3232
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:17,810
Hey, buddy!

3233
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:18,790
Chill, buddy!

3234
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:20,030
Chill!

3235
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:22,310
Let me kill one of your teammates!

3236
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:27,870
Okay, I should actually do the objective.

3237
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:28,770
I can't help it.

3238
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:31,950
Is he dead?

3239
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:33,110
No.

3240
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:35,870
Oh, he got a whip!

3241
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:38,150
Wait, he actually got a whip!

3242
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:38,550
Oh, nice.

3243
01:57:38,690 --> 01:57:38,990
Never mind.

3244
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:42,050
Okay, we got him.

3245
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:45,470
I have to figure out how to get up.

3246
01:57:45,550 --> 01:57:46,470
How do you get up, guys?

3247
01:57:47,390 --> 01:57:48,330
How did you guys...

3248
01:57:48,330 --> 01:57:48,910
Oh, shit!

3249
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:50,050
What are you doing down here?

3250
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:55,010
What are you doing down here?

3251
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:56,370
Oh, there you go.

3252
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:56,810
Oh, there you go.

3253
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:57,790
Guys, we got captured!

3254
01:57:57,970 --> 01:57:59,230
We got to do objectives, guys!

3255
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:01,810
Nice.

3256
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:03,890
We did it.

3257
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:06,410
We're doing objectives.

3258
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:10,470
They don't know that.

3259
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:12,690
They don't know where I am.

3260
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:15,630
He, he, he.

3261
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:22,920
He thought he was safe!

3262
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,760
He thought he was safe!

3263
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:28,420
Haha, jokes on him!

3264
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,320
Okay, we got to help this guy though.

3265
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:39,040
Okay.

3266
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:39,040
Okay.

3267
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:42,220
That's fine.

3268
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:43,880
It's fine.

3269
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,020
I'm okay with that.

3270
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:57,520
I love... I don't... I... Oh.

3271
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:00,100
Oh, he just dodged it.

3272
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,300
God, I love this character.

3273
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:03,500
He's so fun.

3274
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:06,860
I'm glad people don't know how to play this character.

3275
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:10,420
I'm glad I play against this character.

3276
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,420
Wait, what?

3277
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,280
What's been captured?

3278
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:17,820
Oh, we have the...

3279
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,540
Oh, that's captured by enemy.

3280
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:22,860
Oh, shit.

3281
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:25,900
Unlucky.

3282
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,140
I'll use the shield now.

3283
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,360
I don't think he knows.

3284
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,360
He he he, I'm a spider.

3285
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,560
Come on, get out of here.

3286
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:44,160
Did I miss?

3287
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:45,180
Oh, yeah.

3288
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:46,920
I'm glad I'm not.

3289
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:48,940
I would be so mad too.

3290
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:49,520
Look in here.

3291
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:51,240
The sky is ours.

3292
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,340
We wonder if it's... Oh, we have to go here.

3293
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:56,740
Help him.

3294
01:59:58,860 --> 01:59:59,600
Oh, shit.

3295
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:00,200
What's hitting me?

3296
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,080
Oh, no.

3297
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:04,640
Oh, no.

3298
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:06,320
Oh, no.

3299
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:07,200
Oh, no.

3300
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:07,260
Oh, no.

3301
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:08,220
I don't think he knows.

3302
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:09,820
I'll kill him first.

3303
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:11,340
No, I need to kill him before I die.

3304
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:12,340
I need to kill him.

3305
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:12,960
No!

3306
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:14,040
Wait, he has shields!

3307
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:14,760
No!

3308
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:15,820
I fucking fucked up!

3309
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:16,100
Okay.

3310
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,600
It's fine.

3311
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:17,660
It's fine.

3312
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:19,580
Ready to provide aerial cover.

3313
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:22,330
I'm helping.

3314
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:24,810
No way, I got you!

3315
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:26,330
No!

3316
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:35,260
Who hit me?

3317
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,180
Who is this guy?

3318
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:38,860
Oh, my God.

3319
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:39,880
He's also sniping.

3320
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:43,700
Oh, my God.

3321
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,140
It's also a Nurukami.

3322
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:45,680
Oh!

3323
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,920
It was also... They have a sniper too.

3324
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:51,140
Oh!

3325
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,220
I didn't even see him.

3326
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:58,640
Oh, my God.

3327
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,980
This guy was also sniping.

3328
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:02,800
Oh, my God.

3329
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,160
They're winning.

3330
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:05,920
Wait, how did they get the objective so... Oh, my God.

3331
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:06,200
How?

3332
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:11,720
We gotta capture it.

3333
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:16,140
Holy shit.

3334
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:21,240
Oh, he's so low.

3335
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:22,620
Holy shit.

3336
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:24,240
Oh, then he knows.

3337
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:25,300
Oh, he does!

3338
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:28,040
He does.

3339
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:31,500
Holy fuck.

3340
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:32,820
Oh, they're winning.

3341
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,560
Yeah, they capped everything.

3342
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,120
Oh, no!

3343
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:40,280
The panther got me!

3344
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,100
Oh!

3345
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:43,520
Oh, shit!

3346
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,420
Oh, my God.

3347
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:46,500
The Falcon has a thing on.

3348
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:48,020
The Falcon has a thing on.

3349
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:48,480
No!

3350
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:54,100
My team isn't playing objective anymore!

3351
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:57,600
Please, team!

3352
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,780
Why aren't you guys...

3353
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,280
What happened?

3354
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:03,460
Oh, wait.

3355
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:04,860
I'm top fragger.

3356
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:06,260
Okay, that's what happened.

3357
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:08,560
My team.

3358
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,200
Bro, this guy's 6...

3359
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:10,800
Oh, my God.

3360
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,280
He has 600...

3361
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:14,540
Bro, I have a guy with 6k damage.

3362
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:18,360
Okay, what is that guy with 6k damage doing?

3363
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:21,440
What is he doing?

3364
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:23,260
He has 6k.

3365
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:26,300
He has 6k damage.

3366
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:30,060
Fight the team!

3367
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:30,900
Team!

3368
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:33,120
Okay.

3369
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:34,960
I need like...

3370
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,380
Oh, my gosh.

3371
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:37,580
The issue for me is that...

3372
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,980
I'm not paying attention to like...

3373
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:43,160
I truly feel pity for you.

3374
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:44,060
Oh, no!

3375
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:48,900
No, don't say that.

3376
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:49,780
It's fucked up.

3377
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:54,040
Please, I'm trying my best here.

3378
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:58,100
Okay, what hasn't been...

3379
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:58,760
What can you capture?

3380
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,680
Don't say that.

3381
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:00,780
Don't say that.

3382
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:08,430
Okay.

3383
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:10,130
Where's B?

3384
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:11,710
Okay, B is over there.

3385
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:14,430
Oh, my God.

3386
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:15,410
I'm the first one.

3387
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:18,910
I'm the first one to actually press the objective.

3388
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,240
Oh, that guy is a fucking nerd.

3389
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,160
That's a natural nerd.

3390
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:31,740
That's a natural nerd.

3391
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,120
Holy shit.

3392
02:03:38,730 --> 02:03:39,770
Alright, there we go.

3393
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,860
Okay, this guy will die.

3394
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,660
I was gonna say, this guy's gonna have to die.

3395
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:50,480
Alright, we got it.

3396
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,400
Okay.

3397
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:55,320
I'm trying to help my team.

3398
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:56,280
Energy.

3399
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:58,240
Okay.

3400
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:06,890
Oh, my God.

3401
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:07,570
I have to kill this guy.

3402
02:04:08,710 --> 02:04:09,590
Nice, I got him.

3403
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:11,430
We gotta get C though.

3404
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:12,690
Oh!

3405
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:16,290
Coming over, Pathy!

3406
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:18,250
I'm here to help!

3407
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:22,350
Nice!

3408
02:04:24,570 --> 02:04:26,630
Oh God, we have to go back to- God damn it!

3409
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:27,430
We have to go back to B?

3410
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:29,730
Oh, I don't like this mode.

3411
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:31,330
This mode is too fucking long.

3412
02:04:31,730 --> 02:04:32,710
I'm gonna say it.

3413
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:35,870
This mode is too fucking long.

3414
02:04:39,950 --> 02:04:40,750
Jesus Christ.

3415
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:47,260
Okay.

3416
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:48,940
We're fine for now.

3417
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:51,000
We got, we got B.

3418
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:54,340
I don't like this.

3419
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,700
Oh, thank God we got it.

3420
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:56,240
A thousand.

3421
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,480
Oh, this.

3422
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:58,280
Victory!

3423
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:03,620
That mode was so long.

3424
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:11,820
I'm using grapple more so for emergency, to be fair.

3425
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:17,960
I'm doing it more so for like, emergency's sake.

3426
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:22,350
Nice.

3427
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:25,630
Okay.

3428
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:27,110
We did it.

3429
02:05:27,890 --> 02:05:28,510
I don't know.

3430
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:29,630
I'm definitely not MVP.

3431
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:32,250
That, that shit was like, a lot.

3432
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:35,990
Holy, oh wait.

3433
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:36,690
Four deaths?

3434
02:05:36,910 --> 02:05:38,590
Okay, I was gonna- Okay, 7-1-1.

3435
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:38,950
Okay.

3436
02:05:39,550 --> 02:05:40,490
32 total kills.

3437
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:41,830
I don't even know how much I got.

3438
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:43,170
How much did I get?

3439
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,910
Okay, no.

3440
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:44,890
I was almost there.

3441
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:46,350
I was, I just had one extra death.

3442
02:05:46,810 --> 02:05:48,730
Okay, so I was 7-2-2.

3443
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:51,130
So I was, I was, I was helping.

3444
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:52,670
I had two assists in.

3445
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:56,670
I literally just needed, I was, I was just like, one, uh...

3446
02:05:58,450 --> 02:06:00,370
One, uh, one kill off.

3447
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:02,670
Wait, I don't even get a card?

3448
02:06:04,330 --> 02:06:05,330
What the fuck?

3449
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:06,350
I don't...

3450
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:11,150
I don't...

3451
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:11,930
I don't...

3452
02:06:11,930 --> 02:06:12,670
I don't even get a...

3453
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:13,530
I don't...

3454
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:15,990
I don't even get a card?

3455
02:06:16,290 --> 02:06:16,610
I...

3456
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:19,590
What did I do?

3457
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:24,250
I can't...

3458
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:25,570
Okay, let me check.

3459
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:27,250
200, okay.

3460
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:28,690
This guy was...

3461
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:30,670
Oh, cause he got some pills.

3462
02:06:30,670 --> 02:06:31,190
He had...

3463
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:32,190
He took...

3464
02:06:32,190 --> 02:06:33,590
861k.

3465
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:36,650
I mean, I took the least amount of damage!

3466
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:37,650
Come on!

3467
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:41,290
Come fucking on!

3468
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:43,850
Like, this guy did 7k!

3469
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,710
That...

3470
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:47,310
Oh, yeah.

3471
02:06:48,670 --> 02:06:49,750
That was bullshit.

3472
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:51,230
I can't believe it.

3473
02:06:51,590 --> 02:06:54,550
You won no participation trophy.

3474
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:56,950
Okay, now I can play Falcon.

3475
02:06:58,430 --> 02:06:59,310
Okay, now...

3476
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:00,110
I'll try a Falcon.

3477
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:06,590
Alright, here we go.

3478
02:07:07,150 --> 02:07:07,850
I wanna try...

3479
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:09,950
I wanna do 3v3, but like...

3480
02:07:09,950 --> 02:07:12,070
Falcon apparently is really badass at 3v3.

3481
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:13,490
So we'll try again on Hero.

3482
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:15,110
And see if we can get Falcon again.

3483
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:19,750
Let's see...

3484
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:20,770
Oh, are we all fighting?

3485
02:07:20,870 --> 02:07:21,430
No, none of...

3486
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:22,190
Nobody wants to...

3487
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:22,490
Okay.

3488
02:07:23,690 --> 02:07:24,130
Yeah!

3489
02:07:24,910 --> 02:07:25,650
Ready to strike.

3490
02:07:25,690 --> 02:07:26,450
That's right, bitch.

3491
02:07:26,830 --> 02:07:28,170
I Falcon now.

3492
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:30,690
Ready to strike.

3493
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:32,390
Stellaris.

3494
02:07:32,410 --> 02:07:33,110
Ready to strike.

3495
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:33,990
Stellaris.

3496
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:35,130
Ready to strike.

3497
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:36,990
We're all ready to strike, guys.

3498
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:38,750
That's right.

3499
02:07:39,590 --> 02:07:40,850
We're ready to strike.

3500
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:45,190
No, I was laughing at the guy that did 7k...

3501
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:47,170
7k fucking damage.

3502
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:56,280
Alright, here we go.

3503
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:58,460
There are filters for modes?

3504
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,300
Oh, that's really good.

3505
02:07:59,320 --> 02:07:59,880
I like that.

3506
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,200
I like that you can filter...

3507
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:03,520
Uh...

3508
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:05,120
You can filter out like ones you don't like.

3509
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:06,900
Because I definitely didn't like the Domination one.

3510
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:07,560
That one...

3511
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:08,320
So long.

3512
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,060
I took way too long.

3513
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:15,440
Yeah, this game is free to play.

3514
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:16,200
And then...

3515
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:17,320
And you can select 12...

3516
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,500
There's 12 different...

3517
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,780
Characters you can select on launch day.

3518
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:21,560
Which is right now.

3519
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:22,960
Dennis, it's who you're mortal.

3520
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:23,300
Also than turns!

3521
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:24,180
Thank you for the tier one.

3522
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,040
Said you thank you.

3523
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:26,440
Trance, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3524
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:26,820
Thank you.

3525
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:27,440
Thank you.

3526
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:29,080
Uh...

3527
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:30,020
Thank you...

3528
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:31,480
For the Twitch Prime.

3529
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:32,060
And also...

3530
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:34,100
Crack ½, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

3531
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:34,420
Thank you.

3532
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:35,000
Thank you.

3533
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:37,400
Falcon here...

3534
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:37,580
All right.

3535
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:38,100
This one.

3536
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:39,100
I feel like.

3537
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:40,840
I'm gonna be a little more confused.

3538
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:55,140
Okay, I assume I have to be always on playing mode.

3539
02:08:55,620 --> 02:08:58,640
Oh my god.

3540
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,840
So I assume I have to always, like, run around.

3541
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:06,180
How the fuck do I do anything?

3542
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:12,620
Bro, I literally, I'm just flying.

3543
02:09:12,860 --> 02:09:13,240
Whee!

3544
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:15,040
Whee!

3545
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:21,160
Oh, okay, now I don't have... Okay.

3546
02:09:28,410 --> 02:09:31,630
Oh, shit, I have to... I have to back off.

3547
02:09:32,630 --> 02:09:35,250
I have to, like...

3548
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:43,250
Nice, alright.

3549
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:49,890
Alright.

3550
02:09:49,890 --> 02:09:56,430
Yo Shaybari, thank you for the super chat!

3551
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:57,310
Thank you, thank you!

3552
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:58,970
Okay, I need to recharge.

3553
02:09:59,390 --> 02:10:00,030
For sure.

3554
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:01,070
Okay.

3555
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:06,690
I, I just think I'm just poking people...

3556
02:10:08,850 --> 02:10:09,130
Okay.

3557
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:15,610
I... I'm literally just...

3558
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:17,530
I'm just a player.

3559
02:10:18,530 --> 02:10:19,210
Weeeeeee!

3560
02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:25,450
Bro,

3561
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:30,530
no body can't hit me, I'm so fast.

3562
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:32,610
I'm actually so fast.

3563
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:35,410
Nice.

3564
02:10:36,130 --> 02:10:37,370
Okay, this is sad.

3565
02:10:40,930 --> 02:10:43,430
This is actually sad for the enemy team.

3566
02:10:45,610 --> 02:10:51,770
Pew pew pew pew pew 85 lusts.

3567
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:53,730
Yeah, I'm remembering to shoot three.

3568
02:10:53,850 --> 02:10:56,190
Don't worry, I definitely remembered to shoot three.

3569
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:59,750
Okay, I'm gonna kill this guy.

3570
02:10:59,950 --> 02:11:01,770
This guy seems to be the saddest one.

3571
02:11:02,110 --> 02:11:04,010
This guy doesn't seem to have fingers.

3572
02:11:08,850 --> 02:11:10,750
Oh that's so sad.

3573
02:11:11,110 --> 02:11:12,890
Who's that shooting me right now?

3574
02:11:14,710 --> 02:11:15,610
I fly.

3575
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:21,030
Okay, okay, we gotta drop down though.

3576
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:23,110
Oh shit!

3577
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:24,130
That's the whole team!

3578
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:25,770
Alright, we leave.

3579
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:28,730
Did we win?

3580
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:31,850
It's like bullying!

3581
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:33,910
I'm literally just flying!

3582
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:38,450
I'm just doing... I'm just shooting everywhere.

3583
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:40,010
Oh my god!

3584
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:41,310
That's so bullshit!

3585
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:42,550
Oh my god!

3586
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:46,010
But this poor guy had 300 ping, I saw.

3587
02:11:48,370 --> 02:11:49,730
Okay, there's another round.

3588
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,090
Okay.

3589
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:51,910
No, apparently it's two rounds.

3590
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:52,250
Okay.

3591
02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:53,750
Whoever gets two rounds.

3592
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:56,890
Like, that map was not fair.

3593
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:04,150
Oh shit!

3594
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:05,390
Oh I think they know!

3595
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:07,390
I think they know where I am now!

3596
02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:10,410
Whoa!

3597
02:12:11,570 --> 02:12:11,930
What?

3598
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:14,290
I think they know!

3599
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:17,970
I think they're trying to shoot me a specific... Oh my god!

3600
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:20,710
Oh my god!

3601
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:21,790
Wow!

3602
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:26,390
Everyone's turn to shoot me!

3603
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:28,030
Holy fuck!

3604
02:12:28,490 --> 02:12:29,990
Okay, they definitely knew now.

3605
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:32,410
They knew who to shoot this time!

3606
02:12:32,410 --> 02:12:32,510
They knew who to shoot this time!

3607
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:37,930
Oh my god!

3608
02:12:40,210 --> 02:12:43,470
Oh my god!

3609
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:47,450
Yeah, I definitely got shot by everything possible!

3610
02:12:48,370 --> 02:12:50,310
Oh my god!

3611
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:51,590
Bro, stop!

3612
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:53,970
Stop, buddy!

3613
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:55,430
Stop!

3614
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:56,650
Woo!

3615
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,890
Oh my god!

3616
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:01,930
What's wrong with that!

3617
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:06,110
Don't fly into this!

3618
02:13:06,730 --> 02:13:08,930
But they're just like staying there!

3619
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:10,470
It's so hard not to!

3620
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:12,270
They're literally just staying there!

3621
02:13:13,250 --> 02:13:14,510
Okay, I'll help him!

3622
02:13:15,510 --> 02:13:16,210
Okay, I'll help him!

3623
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:17,350
Okay, we gotta go to the repair though!

3624
02:13:18,570 --> 02:13:20,270
Okay, I need to repair myself!

3625
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:23,570
It's okay!

3626
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:24,730
We're fine!

3627
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:25,350
They learned!

3628
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:26,790
They actually learned this time!

3629
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:30,450
Yeah, they learned!

3630
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:31,110
They're...

3631
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:36,290
It's fine!

3632
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:38,730
Let's keep healing!

3633
02:13:39,410 --> 02:13:40,590
I believe in my team!

3634
02:13:40,910 --> 02:13:41,610
Alright, there you go!

3635
02:13:41,690 --> 02:13:42,130
I'll help now!

3636
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:05,920
Alright, let's get back downstairs!

3637
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:08,960
Yay!

3638
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:12,100
I have to have like a shitload of assists right now!

3639
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:17,380
But it is pretty dumb!

3640
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:18,340
I'm gonna say that!

3641
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:24,500
Falcon... Falcon seems to be really, really good at air maps!

3642
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:25,120
For sure!

3643
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:26,320
I like...

3644
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,940
I like...

3645
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:30,360
I...

3646
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:33,600
Falcon... I'm just... I'm literally just...

3647
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:35,280
I'm just... I'm just...

3648
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,320
I'm just... I'm just...

3649
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:36,820
I have 9 assists!

3650
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:38,300
Holy fuck!

3651
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:45,000
I have... I have... I have... I have 9... I have 9 assists!

3652
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:47,120
And only 1 kill!

3653
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:50,340
I was literally just in there, zooming around!

3654
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:54,900
I'm just... just flying around and being a nuisance!

3655
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:55,540
Still wanna save the day!

3656
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,600
Sounds about right!

3657
02:14:58,240 --> 02:14:59,440
Wait, I wanna know!

3658
02:14:59,540 --> 02:15:00,900
How many kills everyone get?

3659
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:04,080
Okay, 1... Okay, yeah, this guy...

3660
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:06,300
Okay... Wait, this guy didn't even win?!

3661
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:07,880
I mean... I was the only one...

3662
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:09,300
Okay, this guy got assists too!

3663
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:10,080
But I...

3664
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,020
I don't even know what I was doing!

3665
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:16,080
I...

3666
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:16,260
I...

3667
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:16,920
I...

3668
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,180
I don't know what I was doing!

3669
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:18,900
I...

3670
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,900
I'm gonna be honest with you guys!

3671
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:21,740
I...

3672
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:22,340
I was...

3673
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:23,460
I was like...

3674
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:25,400
Nooo...

3675
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:27,560
Weeeee!

3676
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,060
Alright, I'll do one more!

3677
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:32,080
Guys, I'll do one more!

3678
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:33,580
I wanna do 3v3!

3679
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:35,060
I really like 3v3!

3680
02:15:35,380 --> 02:15:37,060
And we know what we're gonna play on 3v3!

3681
02:15:37,060 --> 02:15:38,120
Hee hee!

3682
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:41,040
Okay, wait...

3683
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:41,400
Uh...

3684
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:43,100
We gotta swap our striker first...

3685
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:43,740
Before...

3686
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:45,060
We know what we wanna play!

3687
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:48,120
Okay, I might get absolute shit on though!

3688
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,240
Cause I think like...

3689
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:49,880
People are getting better!

3690
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:51,640
Yeah!

3691
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:53,160
She's so dumb!

3692
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:54,560
Okay!

3693
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,160
I think Falcon is...

3694
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:59,120
Falcon is pretty dumb to play!

3695
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,820
I have to bet...

3696
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:03,300
Falcon was like the character where I was like...

3697
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,060
Head empty!

3698
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:05,120
And just...

3699
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:05,960
I'm free!

3700
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:07,040
I'm...

3701
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:08,340
I'm a free bird!

3702
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:09,700
Hehehehe!

3703
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:12,600
Hehehehe!

3704
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:13,880

02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,320
It's time to think again!

3716
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:42,010
Okay, but yeah...

02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:20,120
That sounds so dumb!

3739
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:21,800
That sounds so dumb!

3740
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:23,820
But so fun at the same time!

3741
02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:26,820
Wait!

3742
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,020
There's a falcon!

3743
02:17:28,580 --> 02:17:30,400
There's a falcon right there!

3744
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:37,340
Okay...

3745
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:39,360
Where is he?

3746
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:42,880
There he is!

3747
02:17:44,220 --> 02:17:46,200
What are you doing?

3748
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:52,320
Oh shit!

3749
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:53,460
I'm so dumb!

3750
02:17:53,740 --> 02:17:54,360
What

3751
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:00,820
is...

3752
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:12,460
What is...

3753
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:21,880
Wait!

3754
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:25,240
No!

3755
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:26,600
Wait, I got him!

3756
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:27,160
I got him!

3757
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:27,400
Nice!

3758
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:29,380
Okay!

3759
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:30,700
That map fucking sucked!

3760
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:31,900
That map...

3761
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:35,580
That map was crazy!

3762
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,340
Okay!

3763
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:40,660
I...

3764
02:18:40,660 --> 02:18:42,400
Found the map I hate the most!

3765
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:42,940
For sure!

3766
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:45,720
I definitely know what map I hate!

3767
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:53,060
Oh...

3768
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:53,900
Fuck this!

3769
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:54,900
Oh shit!

3770
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:55,440
Fuck me!

3771
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,840
He's fading me!

3772
02:18:58,140 --> 02:18:58,320
Ah!

3773
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,800
That dashed into it!

3774
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:01,740
I hate the environmental damage!

3775
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:06,140
I...

3776
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:06,340
I...

3777
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:07,300
I wanted to kill him!

3778
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:10,200
I hate the environmental damage!

3779
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:10,840
I...

3780
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:12,360
I got greedy!

3781
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:19,750
I really wanted to kill him!

3782
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:21,410
No, you guys don't understand!

3783
02:19:21,710 --> 02:19:23,710
No, you guys don't understand!

3784
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:26,370
I hate...

3785
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:27,110
Oh, he knows!

3786
02:19:27,310 --> 02:19:28,210
He's using the scouter!

3787
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:33,980
Oh, they know!

3788
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:35,000
Oh no!

3789
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,820
Oh my god!

3790
02:19:39,940 --> 02:19:40,900
I hate...

3791
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:44,920
There we go!

3792
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:47,760
Okay!

3793
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:49,240
I gotta be careful with this!

3794
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:49,540
God!

3795
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:49,940
Okay!

3796
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:50,540
Okay!

3797
02:19:50,580 --> 02:19:50,960
I see it!

3798
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:51,860
I see the engine!

3799
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:56,180
I see the engine!

3800
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:57,000
Okay!

3801
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:01,080
Okay!

3802
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:02,260
Nice!

3803
02:20:10,420 --> 02:20:10,900
Okay!

3804
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:14,990
Oh my god!

3805
02:20:15,570 --> 02:20:16,450
Oh my god!

3806
02:20:16,690 --> 02:20:16,990
Come on!

3807
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,830
It's fine!

3808
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:20,110
I'm...

3809
02:20:20,110 --> 02:20:21,870
I'm okay with thinking for this one!

3810
02:20:22,330 --> 02:20:22,830
Nice!

3811
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:23,390
We got assist!

3812
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:27,590
Oh, I see you!

3813
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:28,530
Come on!

3814
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:29,090
I see you!

3815
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:30,590
Come on!

3816
02:20:31,210 --> 02:20:31,590
Come on!

3817
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:32,010
Peek me!

3818
02:20:32,130 --> 02:20:32,670
I see you!

3819
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:36,110
Come on!

3820
02:20:38,670 --> 02:20:39,430
Come on!

3821
02:20:39,570 --> 02:20:39,650
Come on!

3822
02:20:39,890 --> 02:20:40,690
Come on!

3823
02:20:42,190 --> 02:20:43,450
You're so dumb!

3824
02:20:43,810 --> 02:20:44,970
You're so dumb!

3825
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:51,870
Literally, the only reason I died was that goddamn engine room!

3826
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:56,070
I try...

3827
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:58,510
I have to look at the engine beam because I can't...

3828
02:20:58,510 --> 02:20:59,050
Oh, look at that!

3829
02:20:59,170 --> 02:20:59,630
Six kills!

3830
02:21:01,330 --> 02:21:02,770
That's just sad!

3831
02:21:04,710 --> 02:21:06,430
I better get MVP!

3832
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:06,970
I better get MVP!

3833
02:21:06,970 --> 02:21:08,450
I got six kills out of that eight!

3834
02:21:11,710 --> 02:21:16,390
My one death was literally because I flew into the fucking engine room!

3835
02:21:16,810 --> 02:21:18,310
Oh my god!

3836
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:22,910
I can't believe it!

3837
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:29,150
I can't believe it!

3838
02:21:29,430 --> 02:21:30,170
I can't believe it!

3839
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:30,330
I can't believe it!

3840
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:31,370
That's so dumb!

3841
02:21:31,870 --> 02:21:34,410
I can't...

3842
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:35,870
Okay!

3843
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:37,070
I better...

3844
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:38,550
I better carry this team!

3845
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:39,850
Holy fuck!

3846
02:21:40,050 --> 02:21:42,050
I was playing out of my mind there!

3847
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:43,890
Alright!

3848
02:21:44,310 --> 02:21:46,090
Oh, this guy was a natural baby!

3849
02:21:48,690 --> 02:21:49,210
Fizz...

3850
02:21:49,210 --> 02:21:49,490
Jeez!

3851
02:21:50,410 --> 02:21:51,210
He has...

3852
02:21:51,210 --> 02:21:51,910
Seven...

3853
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:53,250
He's been playing for point...

3854
02:21:53,730 --> 02:21:54,010
Okay!

3855
02:21:54,050 --> 02:21:55,090
I was gonna say...

3856
02:21:55,870 --> 02:21:57,410
He has a hundred percent...

3857
02:21:57,410 --> 02:21:57,490
Oh!

3858
02:21:57,590 --> 02:21:58,990
He doesn't have a win rate on this!

3859
02:21:59,370 --> 02:21:59,690
So...

3860
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,590
Get out of my lobby!

3861
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:06,070
That's so cute!

3862
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:07,750
Get out of my lobby!

3863
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:09,430
Yeah, alright!

3864
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:10,750
Guys, okay!

3865
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:12,830
I know I said last game with...

3866
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:13,570
Fal...

3867
02:22:13,570 --> 02:22:14,490
Uh, with...

3868
02:22:14,490 --> 02:22:14,730
With now...

3869
02:22:14,730 --> 02:22:15,370
But I...

3870
02:22:15,370 --> 02:22:15,550
Okay!

3871
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:16,770
How do we do custom lobbies?

3872
02:22:16,910 --> 02:22:17,550
I want...

3873
02:22:17,550 --> 02:22:19,590
A 3V3...

3874
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:20,390
Custom...

3875
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:21,290
Oh, custom room!

3876
02:22:21,390 --> 02:22:21,830
There we go!

3877
02:22:23,610 --> 02:22:24,090
3V3...

3878
02:22:24,090 --> 02:22:24,810
Custom...

3879
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:25,250
Lobby!

3880
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:28,010
Falcon only.

3881
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:30,290
Wait, which maps should we do?

3882
02:22:30,910 --> 02:22:31,050
Wait.

3883
02:22:33,370 --> 02:22:35,090
Which one is the best map?

3884
02:22:35,650 --> 02:22:39,250
Okay, obviously, it has to be Operation Merge.

3885
02:22:39,810 --> 02:22:39,950
Okay.

3886
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:44,170
Wait, no, it has to be Ace Arena because it's 3v3.

3887
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:45,530
I don't think six of us.

3888
02:22:45,610 --> 02:22:47,350
I don't think we should do six of us in.

3889
02:22:47,810 --> 02:22:48,050
All right.

3890
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:49,190
Which is... is this?

3891
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:50,110
Oh, this is Ariel.

3892
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:53,270
Okay.

3893
02:22:53,590 --> 02:22:54,150
Guys.

3894
02:22:54,850 --> 02:22:55,870
Falcon only.

3895
02:22:56,170 --> 02:22:57,550
Falcon only, guys.

3896
02:22:57,810 --> 02:23:00,190
It has to be Falcon only.

3897
02:23:01,790 --> 02:23:02,350
Guys.

3898
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:04,650
Not... Guys, come in here.

3899
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:09,790
We're ending it with... 3v3 Falcon only.

3900
02:23:13,990 --> 02:23:14,730
All right.

3901
02:23:15,030 --> 02:23:15,550
Let's go.

3902
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:20,010
I swear to God, we better all be... we better all be Falcons, guys.

3903
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:21,170
It's even better.

3904
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:24,610
All right.

3905
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:25,650
Ready to strike.

3906
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:27,210
Oh, can we not do that?

3907
02:23:27,470 --> 02:23:27,810
Oh, nice.

3908
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:28,130
We can.

3909
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:30,590
Oh, can we not lock in?

3910
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:31,430
Oh, we can.

3911
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:31,890
Okay.

3912
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:32,630
Ready to strike.

3913
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:33,110
All Falcon.

3914
02:23:34,670 --> 02:23:35,650
No, we don't.

3915
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:36,530
We don't have to.

3916
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:38,150
We can actually be all Falcons.

3917
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:39,130
All right.

3918
02:23:40,210 --> 02:23:40,690
Let's go.

3919
02:23:40,690 --> 02:23:41,290
Let's go.

3920
02:23:42,790 --> 02:23:43,910
Let's go.

3921
02:23:44,310 --> 02:23:44,330
Let's go.

3922
02:23:44,990 --> 02:23:45,630
Let's go.

3923
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:47,350
It's going to be so dumb.

3924
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:50,590
It's going to be so fucking stupid.

3925
02:23:51,250 --> 02:23:51,910
But...

3926
02:23:52,590 --> 02:23:53,790
It's Falcon time.

3927
02:23:56,310 --> 02:23:58,010
Falcons roll out.

3928
02:24:01,990 --> 02:24:04,210
I don't know how we are going to die.

3929
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:12,920
My falcon team.

3930
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:16,420
Alright, here we go.

3931
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:20,740
The fight of the mosquitos.

3932
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:23,360
Launch!

3933
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:27,800
Alright, here we go.

3934
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:30,680
Here we go, guys.

3935
02:24:31,420 --> 02:24:33,000
The sky is ours, guys.

3936
02:24:41,660 --> 02:24:43,120
Oh my god!

3937
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,400
Oh my shields!

3938
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:46,180
Oh my shields!

3939
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:47,820
Oh my shields!

3940
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:54,500
Wait, this guy is almost dead!

3941
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:55,200
This guy... No!

3942
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:58,660
Oh no, I have to recharge.

3943
02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:00,340
Guys, I have to recharge!

3944
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:00,740
No!

3945
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:06,760
Oh my god.

3946
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:10,540
Okay, I got first kill though.

3947
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:15,160
I missed you down.

3948
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:16,980
Don't worry, I'm back!

3949
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:18,920
Don't worry, I'm back!

3950
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:26,960
Don't worry, I'm here!

3951
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:28,700
Don't worry, team!

3952
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:30,680
Don't worry!

3953
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:32,680
The falcon's here too!

3954
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:34,080
Oh my god!

3955
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:40,340
That's right, I'm coming for you.

3956
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:44,340
Wait, somebody... Wait, no, nobody... I just can't see.

3957
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:45,120
Okay.

3958
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:47,200
Don't worry, I got you.

3959
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:48,660
It's okay.

3960
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:49,760
Somebody... Oh my god!

3961
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:53,220
Somebody has... One of my teammates has 500 ping!

3962
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:56,060
I don't know what your plan is, guys.

3963
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:56,420
I don't know what your plan is, guys.

3964
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:02,740
It's okay, but nobody's dying!

3965
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:06,820
Nobody... Nobody is dying!

3966
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:09,040
Because... Okay.

3967
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:12,440
Because we're all just in the sky...

3968
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,720
It's so hard to kill anybody.

3969
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:21,920
Okay, it's fine.

3970
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:23,180
There we go.

3971
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:26,000
That's right.

3972
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:27,500
I'm in your walls.

3973
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:29,760
That's right.

3974
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:34,000
Okay, I'm gonna recharge.

3975
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,100
I'm gonna recharge energy.

3976
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:38,280
Okay.

3977
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:39,840
We gotta help him.

3978
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:44,600
Don't worry.

3979
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:45,220
I got you.

3980
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:47,440
I got you, Falcons.

3981
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:50,340
Don't worry.

3982
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:53,200
I got you, Falcons.

3983
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,640
Oh my god, this fight is so close.

3984
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:05,420
This is so close already.

3985
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:06,360
Okay.

3986
02:27:07,460 --> 02:27:08,480
We gotta get this guy.

3987
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:10,180
Okay.

3988
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:11,100
Don't worry.

3989
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,560
I know how to manage my fuel now.

3990
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:14,780
I'm learning.

3991
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:17,160
Where are the other planes?

3992
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:18,180
There we go.

3993
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,900
Look at this aerial maneuver.

3994
02:27:22,620 --> 02:27:23,940
Oh, I see you.

3995
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:25,420
I see you.

3996
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,240
Oh my god, I see you.

3997
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:29,320
I fucking see you.

3998
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:31,040
Oh shit, I'm out.

3999
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:31,840
I'm out of range.

4000
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:33,500
Oh my god, I'm so lost.

4001
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:35,180
Where am I?

4002
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:37,760
Stabilizing.

4003
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:39,040
Oh, where?

4004
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:40,000
Oh, it's the pulse door.

4005
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:41,220
Oh no.

4006
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:41,860
We can't see.

4007
02:27:42,740 --> 02:27:43,620
We got high.

4008
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:46,020
Oh my god.

4009
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:46,360
Teammate.

4010
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:49,660
Don't worry.

4011
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:51,580
I got you.

4012
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:54,040
I got you, team.

4013
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:56,880
I can't see anything, but I got you.

4014
02:27:57,800 --> 02:28:00,500
Oh my god, we can't aim because I can't see.

4015
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:04,040
I don't know which one.

4016
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:04,220
Oh.

4017
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:06,700
Okay.

4018
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:07,660
Oh, I see you.

4019
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:10,300
There you go.

4020
02:28:12,180 --> 02:28:13,820
Oh no, not the posture.

4021
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:15,560
Oh my god.

4022
02:28:19,300 --> 02:28:20,700
Oh, I see you.

4023
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:23,700
Oh, I know you're... Where are you?

4024
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:25,000
Wait, where are you?

4025
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:27,440
I have a... No, my compass doesn't work.

4026
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:31,600
What do you mean are advancing?

4027
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:33,080
Oh my god, he killed two.

4028
02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:35,040
Oh no, compass jams.

4029
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:39,060
Oh no, my compass jams.

4030
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:40,640
I don't know.

4031
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:43,340
Oh shit, I think they knew.

4032
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:45,780
Guys, team, team, team, team, I need help.

4033
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:46,580
Team, I need help.

4034
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:53,860
Okay,

4035
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,060
we still have... Okay, it's five, it's five.

4036
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:03,460
You don't know what's happening?

4037
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:04,000
Don't worry.

4038
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:07,440
I don't think any of us do.

4039
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:08,780
Don't worry.

4040
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:12,740
I literally don't think any of us know what we're doing right now.

4041
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:15,520
The sky is ours.

4042
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:22,020
It's so hard to play the... to play out the Falcon.

4043
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:24,020
Holy shit.

4044
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:25,920
Holy fuck.

4045
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:29,400
Where's my teammate?

4046
02:29:29,860 --> 02:29:30,560
Oh no.

4047
02:29:31,880 --> 02:29:32,920
Oh no.

4048
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:33,980
We have to leave.

4049
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:35,980
Team!

4050
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:37,420
I'm getting jumped!

4051
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:39,120
Team!

4052
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:39,880
Where's my team?

4053
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:40,820
Oh no.

4054
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:42,200
Oh no.

4055
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:44,380
Oh, I wasn't!

4056
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:45,080
Okay, that's good.

4057
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:45,800
It wasn't me.

4058
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:47,040
I wasn't last killed.

4059
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:47,420
Yay!

4060
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:51,300
Guys, it's okay.

4061
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:52,220
I wasn't last killed.

4062
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:55,420
I wasn't last killed.

4063
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:56,560
It's okay.

4064
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:59,080
I'm being overstimulated.

4065
02:29:59,340 --> 02:29:59,860
It's great.

4066
02:30:01,980 --> 02:30:03,640
That's all that matters.

4067
02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:05,300
We did it, guys.

4068
02:30:09,380 --> 02:30:11,000
Oh, that's a cool design.

4069
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:12,400
That design was cool.

4070
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:14,220
Oh my god.

4071
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:16,600
That was crazy.

4072
02:30:17,220 --> 02:30:19,800
That was a crazy Falcon.

4073
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:22,300
Falcon V Falcon game.

4074
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:25,480
All right.

4075
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:28,040
That... that was really fun, though.

4076
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:29,760
Again...

4077
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:30,460
Hey...

4078
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:32,760
I can't believe...

4079
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:33,740
Hey...

4080
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:38,380
I can't believe you can do all Falcons.

4081
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:39,260
Yeah.

4082
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:41,620
Yeah, you can do custom paint and everything.

4083
02:30:41,820 --> 02:30:42,180
You can...

4084
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:44,300
Summonize so much stuff for this game.

4085
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:50,400
But again, a huge shout out and thank you to Amazing Season Games for the sponsor.

4086
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:51,500
And, um...

4087
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:54,920
For inviting me to check out this game.

4088
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:56,840
As you guys know, this is free to play.

4089
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:58,200
So, um...

4090
02:30:58,200 --> 02:30:59,880
So, you don't have to pay anything.

4091
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:04,640
And the game already comes out with like 12 characters that you can play on launch.

4092
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,520
So, there's a lot of different types of characters you can play.

4093
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:07,500
You can do Melee.

4094
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:08,300
You can do Sniper.

4095
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:10,840
You can do whatever the fuck I just did.

4096
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:16,780
With the pea shooter in the air.

4097
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:22,300
Like I said, my favorite is definitely Nurukami as a sniper.

4098
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:27,660
I think her sniping and movement sniping is really, really fun for me out of all the characters.

4099
02:31:27,940 --> 02:31:31,280
But obviously, it depends on like what type of play style you like.

4100
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:32,520
And I like movement shooters.

4101
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:33,920
So, it's actually crazy.

4102
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:35,060
I didn't even play a single support.

4103
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:37,120
I feel like for this game because like...

4104
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:37,900
I don't know.

4105
02:31:38,380 --> 02:31:40,480
I guess if it's ranked, then I'd play support.

4106
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:44,840
But like, for this game right now, at the moment, there's no reason to play support.

4107
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:46,840
Because it's like, you know...

4108
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:49,240
Because you're mostly just shooting.

4109
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:51,300
So, I feel like...

4110
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:52,880
I think if it was ranked, then maybe.

4111
02:31:53,060 --> 02:31:55,920
But for quick play, I don't think you really need support at all.

4112
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:59,040
But yes, for those who don't know, this is a third person shooter.

4113
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:01,800
The only thing I didn't try out as much was MASHMACK.

4114
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:08,460
But that was because I personally am not like a huge fan of extraction shooters in general.

4115
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:09,940
But that's why...

4116
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:11,580
That's why...

4117
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:17,740
There's three different modes that you can do for whichever...

4118
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:21,040
You know, for the specific type of game mode that you like to do.

4119
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:25,020
So, for me in general, I like Kyo Shooter and I like 3v3.

4120
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:26,940
So, they were really fun for me.

4121
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:28,660
Extraction shooter in general, I just...

4122
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:31,460
I'm not like a huge extraction shooter guy.

4123
02:32:31,580 --> 02:32:32,520
That's why I only played it once.

4124
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:34,020
Omni, thank you for 1000Bitties.

4125
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:35,640
Thank you, thank you.

4126
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:38,300
And Ranul-san, thank you for the resub.

4127
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:39,240
Thank you, thank you.

4128
02:32:39,380 --> 02:32:41,240
I don't know if there is already ranked, but...

4129
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:44,300
I won't be surprised if it's added later on.

4130
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:48,520
But yes, as you can see, you can customize your mechas and everything.

4131
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:52,260
You can customize your character and you can customize your mechas as well.

4132
02:32:52,460 --> 02:32:56,680
And it's available on Steam, Xbox, and Windows PC via the Xbox app.

4133
02:32:57,200 --> 02:32:58,740
But yes, thank you again, everybody.

4134
02:32:58,740 --> 02:33:00,120
I hope you guys had a fun time.

4135
02:33:00,220 --> 02:33:01,680
I hope you guys got your Twitch drops.

4136
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:04,920
For those who don't know, you get Twitch drops for watching.

4137
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:07,500
So, I hope all of you guys were able to get some Twitch drops.

4138
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:11,600
Do not worry if you guys didn't because I will be streaming this again.

4139
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:16,480
I am sponsored to stream this again, I believe, next week.

4140
02:33:16,760 --> 02:33:19,040
So, I will be streaming again next week for everybody.

4141
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:24,560
So, if you guys did not get your drops, next week I will be streaming again for those who haven't got it yet.

4142
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:30,620
But yes, thank you again to Mecha Break and Amazing CSUN Games for the sponsor.

4143
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:31,740
I'm going to call it here.

4144
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:33,420
As always, everybody, say hi.

4145
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:36,760
Oh wait, before I leave, for those who don't know me, my name is DokiBrain.

4146
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:40,860
I usually stream on YouTube, but today I'm on Twitch for the sponsor.

4147
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,360
Because, you know, like I said, Twitch drops.

4148
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:46,420
I did have a lot of fun.

4149
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:48,020
I did have a lot of fun.

4150
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:50,720
But yes, you can check me out on YouTube.

4151
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:52,960
Please feel free to subscribe to me over there.

4152
02:33:53,380 --> 02:34:02,860
If you guys want to support the stream, support the sponsor, please feel free to do exclamation point Mecha and click on the link that's pinned in the chat or that's in the command.

4153
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:05,740
So, it does support the stream and it does support the sponsor.

4154
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:06,860
And it's free.

4155
02:34:06,980 --> 02:34:07,560
The game is free.

4156
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:08,880
You can download it via the link.

4157
02:34:10,280 --> 02:34:13,960
If you want to support me via other means, there are other things going on.

4158
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:21,060
If you use the commands merch or Hyatt or Gamersupps, there's other means to support me.

4159
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:22,380
What else?

4160
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:23,060
What else do I have to share?

4161
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:23,600
Oh, yes.

4162
02:34:23,900 --> 02:34:29,060
If you're going to be at Anime Expo on July 3rd, I will be having a 3D concert at Anime Expo.

4163
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:31,560
And I will have like merch there as well.

4164
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:33,600
So, you guys can purchase some stuff over there.

4165
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:36,600
I'm trying to see if there's anything else to ship.

4166
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:40,880
If you want to know whenever I stream on Twitch, follow me on Twitter.

4167
02:34:41,140 --> 02:34:44,680
So, follow me on Twitter, the exclamation point socials.

4168
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:46,780
I usually tweet out whenever I stream on Twitch.

4169
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:47,640
As always, everybody.

4170
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:51,020
Stay hydrated, pause your check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4171
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:53,040
And if you suffer me, head to bed.

4172
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:54,440
Cause you deserve it.

4173
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:55,760
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4174
02:34:56,220 --> 02:34:56,940
Bye, guys.

4175
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:57,760
Bye.
