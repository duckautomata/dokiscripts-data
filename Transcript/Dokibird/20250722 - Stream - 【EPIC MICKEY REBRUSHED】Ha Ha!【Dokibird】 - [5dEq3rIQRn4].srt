00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,280
Hello, everyone!

2
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh my god, everything's moving!

3
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,280
Whoa!

4
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,180
Yes, surprise!

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,420
You're now moving!

6
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,500
Whoa, surprise!

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,500
You guys can move now!

8
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,680
Look at you all go!

9
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,540
Oh my god, look!

10
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,200
That's me!

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,420
Oh my god, did you see it?

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,220
Alright, um, so, okay, um, I hate to kill the mood right away after you guys were like, Wow!

13
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,620
The moving background!

14
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,260
But, I have several life updates.

15
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,820
Some good, some bad.

16
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,880
Um, so, I won't say bad.

17
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,600
Okay, bad is a harsh word.

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,260
Okay, I'm gonna rip the band-aid off.

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,960
Um, but, okay, I'm gonna rip the band-aid off right now.

20
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,780
Um, I didn't tweet about it because, you know, yesterday was, like, VTuber Armageddon.

21
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,380
So, I didn't want to, like, add more to it.

22
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:49,800
Um,

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,980
so, um, but I'll talk about it here.

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,160
Uh, that's why we're on this screen because today's might be a little short stream today.

25
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:07,140
Um, but, um, um, that's why I put it on this screen because, like, I feel weird just, like, talking for- Like, I don't know how long I'll be talking for it.

26
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,440
And it would be weird that I'm just, like, a tiny thing on the far right side.

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,680
And then, like, you know, um, it's like, I'm gonna talk today.

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,220
I might as well be on a chatting screen.

29
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,080
Um, but anyway, uh, last night, uh, I had to take Dad to the pet hospital last night.

30
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,480
Um, because he was being really weird.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,080
Um, he's okay right now.

32
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,040
Well, he's sedated in terms of, like, I gave him painkillers.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,500
Um, but, I mean, that's okay.

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:47,320
Um, but basically, um, last night to take Dad to the hospital, uh, because I noticed he was- This happened- I- this was, like, two days ago when I started noticing something weird.

35
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,500
Um, he was very not himself in terms of, like, super low energy.

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,800
Um, and, uh, he was super low energy for some reason.

37
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,440
And I thought that was really weird because when I take him for walkies, he would love to play fetch.

38
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,760
And, um, two days ago, last- like, the night, two days ago, he wasn't really feeling like fetch.

39
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,540
I threw the ball once and then he picked it up and then later he's like, I'm done now.

40
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,520
And I was like, that's weird.

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,920
Usually you would want to play, like, a couple of times before you'd be like, I'm done now.

42
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,960
So I was like, okay, maybe he's just really tired today.

43
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,820
So, um, I waited until, like, yesterday, yesterday.

44
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,460
And then he- yesterday, um, I was like, oh, he is still very tired for some reason during walkies.

45
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,260
Like, he still woke me up for food and stuff.

46
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
So I was like, okay, he's back to normal.

47
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,640
And then, um, and then I was like, okay, so- okay, so he's getting better.

48
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,700
And he- he- whatever happened, like, two days ago, it was just a fluke.

49
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,600
But then, last night, um, I was gonna take him for walkies last night.

50
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
And he was hiding under my bed.

51
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,200
And I was very concerned because he refused to get out from under my bed.

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,100
And, um, I was like, okay, maybe, like, you know, I'll wait, like, an hour or two.

53
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,400
And then, uh, we'll see how it goes.

54
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,820
I'll wait for an hour and two.

55
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,620
We'll see if he's okay now.

56
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,600
And then I'll wait an hour and two and he was still under my bed.

57
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,420
And he was, like, shaking under my bed.

58
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,820
And I noticed he was, like, licking his mouth.

59
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,900
Uh, for those who don't know, dog body language, if they lick their mouth a lot, that means they're incredibly stressed or anxious.

60
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,800
So I knew, like, something's wrong if he's, like, licking his mouth a lot.

61
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,940
And he was, like, shaking underneath the bed.

62
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,600
And it was already, like, three- he was three hours late for his walkies.

63
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,000
And I was like, oh, no.

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,860
Like, okay, something's wrong.

65
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:47,360
So, like, I called the hospital and they said, uh, because, you know, it was, like, fucking, it was, like, 10.30 p.m.

66
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,100
at that point.

67
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,980
Um, it was 10.30 p.m.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,920
and obviously, no, none of my, the vets are open, so, like, the only place I could call was the hospital.

69
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,220
So, um, I called the vet and they're, like, oh, um, it could be, like, you could wait tomorrow morning to see if he's better.

70
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Um, or, like, you could bring him over right now.

71
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,160
And I was, like, I'll bring him over right now just in case because he's, like, he has a lot of fucking things going on around him with his, like, allergies and his, like, kidney issues.

72
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,340
And, you know, the fact that he, he was, he just got, like, he got served back surgery a couple of months ago.

73
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:28,620
Um, so, um, what I had to do to get him out from the bed, under the bed, is that I had to, like, lift my mattress up and that, like, freaked him out.

74
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,880
And he's, like, what's going on?

75
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:37,380
And then he, like, basically, like, got out from under my bed and, uh, and, like, went into my office.

76
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,580
So, like, and just, like, laid in the bed under my office because he was, like, freaked.

77
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,580
He was, like, oh, my God!

78
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,040
Like, oh, my God!

79
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,600
My little hidey hole!

80
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,880
Like, why is there light?

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
And then, so, um, that was, like, my way to get him out.

82
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,200
But he learned.

83
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:57,640
Okay, but to be fair, after I did that, he, like, today, he realized that he's, like, I know you're putting tricks on me.

84
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,580
So, like, when I do that, I did that today again.

85
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,460
And then he, because he was hiding underneath my bed again today.

86
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,300
And, um, and then he stayed under the bed because he knew it was a trick that I did on him.

87
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:15,680
Um, but anyway, um, anyway, so, uh, that was my way to get him out, uh, last night.

88
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:25,880
Um, and like I said, he wouldn't let me, he wouldn't, like, when I was trying to pick him, like, like, get him out from under the bed, I was, like, you know, letting my hand out.

89
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,000
He wouldn't even eat, like, even when I gave him treats, he was, like, he would just, like, he was, like, I know you're trying to get me.

90
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,740
So, he was, like, super cautious when, um, he was super fucking cautious when I was trying to give him treats, too, to get out.

91
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,120
And so, like, he was, like, I know you're putting a trick on me.

92
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,720
And then he would, like, he'll only eat the treat if I had, like, open palm on my hand and I don't stick it out of the bed.

93
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,240
Like, he'll only take the treat when it's, like, under the bed.

94
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,260
And like every time... and then when he sees my other arm move up, he screws back under.

95
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,880
Because he knows I'm trying to pick him up.

96
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,440
He knows I'm trying to like get him out.

97
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,420
So like I couldn't like get him out with treats or anything.

98
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:08,060
And he wouldn't let me... every time I try my hands get closer to him, when I don't have a treat, he like backs up deeper into the bed.

99
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,400
And then when I go to the other side to get him, he goes to the other side.

100
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,980
So he's like playing this stupid fucking cat and mouse game with me.

101
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
And I had enough and I just lifted the mattress out.

102
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,200
But anyway, I took him to the hospital.

103
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,740
And apparently, you know, like, you know, it's like emergency hospital.

104
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,820
So like they don't have a lot of staff during... late at night.

105
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,560
They don't have a lot of staff during late at night.

106
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,180
So I had to wait three hours.

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,480
I had to wait three hours until dad was seen.

108
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,760
And it was like...

109
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,380
Yeah, he was too smart for his own fucking good.

110
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,080
And basically like I waited like two to three hours.

111
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,300
Because like I said, it was like late at night.

112
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,760
And, uh, all the other, uh, like, you know, there were other patients ahead of him.

113
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,840
Like, it was the emergency.

114
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,020
So they were prioritizing, which was more, like, you know, urgent care, you know?

115
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:09,800
Like, you know, like, actual human hospitals where, like, you know, if you have, like, uh, you know, if you have a fever or something, or something, or you have a headache, and then the guy next to you got stabbed, who do you- but you came there first,

116
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,000
who do you think they're gonna see first?

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
The guy that just got stabbed or you?

118
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,180
Like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

119
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,740
Anyway, so we had to wait like two-ish hours until we were seen.

120
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,840
And I felt really bad.

121
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,840
I felt really sad and bad because like he was... It was like, obviously he was not himself.

122
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,520
He was super low energy and he was like very scared and like timid.

123
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,520
And I was here first.

124
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,080
And he was shaking.

125
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,140
Like, he didn't shake a lot when we were like sitting there in the waiting room.

126
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:04,440
Anyway, but... So when we finally saw the doctor and like she like took him back in the back and like examined him and everything.

127
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,180
And then like she talked to me about it.

128
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:14,320
But basically, they think that dad sprained his muscle somehow.

129
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,400
It must have been fetched because like I was like he doesn't move other than for a fetch.

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,000
So they think he sprained a muscle on his neck.

131
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,180
Because they were moving his neck and he... Because I, you know, I don't know what was around.

132
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,380
Like I saw a little limp.

133
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,680
I wasn't sure it was a limp.

134
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,360
So they think he sprained his neck muscles.

135
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,260
Because when they were moving his neck, you know, like to test like everything.

136
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,340
He was like crying out when they moved his neck apparently.

137
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,900
Um...

138
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,120
And um...

139
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,780
They don't know.

140
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,800
They're like, okay, most likely it'll be like two weeks.

141
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,940
Uh...

142
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,120
Until he's fully recovered.

143
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,680
But they said if in two weeks he doesn't fully recover or he'll get worse.

144
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,960
The thing I'm scared about was that they said it could be a disc issue on his neck.

145
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,640
But like he said, like they're not sure.

146
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
They're not very sure.

147
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:15,020
But most likely they're trying to reassure me and said that it could be just a sprain on the muscles.

148
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,600
Um...

149
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
So I'm hoping it's that.

150
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,420
Uh...

151
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,540
But he is moving.

152
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,920
He is moving.

153
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,540
And um...

154
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,880
He is like walking around.

155
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,700
I...

156
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,160
Um...

157
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,960
So...

158
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,320
Uh...

159
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,840
He's okay.

160
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,320
In terms of movement, he can move and everything.

161
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,220
Um...

162
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,100
So I hope it is just...

163
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,360
Uh...

164
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,460
Just the sprain.

165
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,640
And it is to say like...

166
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,080
Uh...

167
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,180
If it does get worse.

168
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,020
Or uh...

169
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,280
If uh...

170
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,280
He...

171
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,220
Uh...

172
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,600
If in two weeks he doesn't fully recover.

173
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Or like, you know, if the energy doesn't come back within like two weeks or so.

174
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,220
Then I should take him back earlier.

175
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,300
Or like within those two weeks to get a scan.

176
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,080
On...

177
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,880
On the areas.

178
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,600
So I'm hoping it's not that serious.

179
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,500
Um...

180
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:58,680
I...

181
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,660
I think it was because of Fetch.

182
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,120
Because he...

183
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,480
Um...

184
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,120
Even when I try not to.

185
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,720
He...

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,320
He doesn't know that he's a wiener dog.

187
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,960
He doesn't know that his body is not meant to do the things that he's supposed to do.

188
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,580
Because he's...

189
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,800
When I'm at the dog park.

190
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,860
He sees so many other dogs running around jumping everywhere.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,720
And then he's like...

192
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,560
I can do that too.

193
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,680
But then like...

194
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,000
You know...

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,240
And then when other people bring their balls.

196
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,860
He chases after like the ball as well.

197
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,560
And I can't fucking stop him.

198
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,840
Unless I walk up to him.

199
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
And like take him away.

200
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,160
And he would like chase other people's balls as well.

201
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,340
So he's like...

202
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,740
Oh my god!

203
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,880
I can do that too!

204
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,520
And...

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,760
So...

206
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,600
I am hoping that it's just a sprain on his neck.

207
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,400
And like...

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,620
We know it's a neck sprain.

209
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,200
Like...

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,820
And we know the problem is around the neck.

211
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,180
Because that's where he's like...

212
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,460
Ow!

213
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,020
Owie!

214
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,280
Um...

215
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,820
Um...

216
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,320
But yeah.

217
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,380
Anyway...

218
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,060
Uh...

219
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,260
Yeah.

220
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,560
He doesn't know he's a fucking genetic freak.

221
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:55,860
Anyway.

222
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,480
So...

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,960
Um...

224
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,720
This morning...

225
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,100
I got a little worried this morning.

226
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,200
Because he didn't wake me up for food at all.

227
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,080
So like...

228
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,520
I slept till like 10am.

229
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,060
And usually he wakes me up at 6am for food to be fed.

230
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,700
And he didn't wake me up.

231
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,760
At first I thought it was because of the medication.

232
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,320
Because they gave me painkillers.

233
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
And they told me that when he ingests those painkillers...

234
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,580
He gets sedated.

235
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,060
Um...

236
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,880
So...

237
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,280
Um...

238
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,740
He gets sedated and stuff.

239
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,320
So he...

240
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,840
Like so...

241
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
And sluggish.

242
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,460
So he'll sleep more.

243
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,440
So I assumed...

244
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,640
It was that.

245
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,780
That was the reason why he didn't wake me up.

246
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,180
But I still like...

247
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,820
Like 10am.

248
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,740
He didn't wake me up.

249
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,320
And then like...

250
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,660
I got out of bed at...

251
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,180
And I was like...

252
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,060
Oh maybe he's still sleeping.

253
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,800
So I got out of bed at 11am.

254
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
And then I noticed...

255
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,460
He was still underneath my bed.

256
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,700
And I was like...

257
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,460
That's weird.

258
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,200
And I was like...

259
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,980
Well not weird.

260
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,420
I was like...

261
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,800
Okay I assume he's still in pain.

262
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,580
Um...

263
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,340
Because of the sprain.

264
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,240
So I...

265
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,660
Um...

266
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,160
I...

267
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,540
I like...

268
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,880
Um...

269
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,440
To be fair...

270
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,560
Okay.

271
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,180
I didn't mess up a little bit.

272
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
Because before I took him to the hospital...

273
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,200
Um...

274
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,760
During his morning walks...

275
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,960
I also played fetch with him.

276
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,420
But like I threw the ball once.

277
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,460
And he like ran for it.

278
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,420
And then after he ran for it in the morning...

279
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,280
Because I didn't think...

280
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,380
I didn't think he was...

281
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,540
There was anything wrong at that time.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,940
And in the morning...

283
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,500
I noticed like...

284
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh he's still a little tired.

285
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,960
Because he only got...

286
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,100
Ran for the ball once in the morning.

287
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,580
Like...

288
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,100
It was not today.

289
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,820
It was yesterday.

290
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,360
Yesterday.

291
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,520
Before like...

292
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,020
It was nighttime when I realized something was wrong because he was sailing under my bed.

293
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,340
But yesterday morning, I was like, let's play fetch.

294
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,740
And then I threw the ball and then he ran for the ball.

295
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,760
And then when he got the ball, he walked back with me.

296
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,480
He's like, I'm done.

297
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,580
I don't want to play anymore.

298
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,400
And I was like, oh, that's that's a little weird.

299
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,900
Maybe you're still maybe you just don't feel like it.

300
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,480
So you're still like tired or something.

301
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,380
But he didn't cry or whimper at all.

302
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,120
Like he was walking fine.

303
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,900
So I didn't see any red flags at that time.

304
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,840
But I was like, oh, there might be something wrong.

305
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,460
But then like last night was when I realized, OK, something is wrong because he was still under my bed.

306
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:05,080
Um, anyway, uh, today, um, you know, I woke up and then I got his food.

307
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:15,780
Um, and, uh, and I got his food and I went to, um, I was like, come on, food time, food time.

308
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,240
But he didn't come out.

309
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,040
And then I was like, that's weird.

310
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,700
You know, uh, uh, if it's the back disc.

311
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,580
I know he already had surgery for his back.

312
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,080
The neck is where I'm scared of, like, I'm scared about the neck though.

313
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,980
Uh, but like, uh, I'm scared it was, it's a disc on the neck.

314
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,360
So I'm just hoping that it's just the, just a sprain.

315
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,100
But anyway, so I was like, okay, he doesn't want to come out for food.

316
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,440
He hears me opening his canned food.

317
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,640
And then I looked under.

318
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,900
He's under my bed again.

319
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,080
And then so I put the dog tray to his dog food because I've got his little dog cat.

320
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,760
Like his, you know, the tray for his food.

321
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,720
And I put it under the bed.

322
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,740
And then he instantly goes like, om nom nom nom.

323
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,240
Like, you know, he's eating fine.

324
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,420
He's pooping fine.

325
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,060
No diarrhea.

326
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,040
He's pooping fine.

327
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,600
And he still has his appetite.

328
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,260
But he's just like, you know, it's just a pain, you know.

329
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,200
So, and then...

330
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,880
Oh, turn off.

331
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,900
You guys want me to turn off the music?

332
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,000
I mean, I could turn off the music.

333
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,460
Is it too loud, guys?

334
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,600
Is the music too loud?

335
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,420
I could turn it down at least.

336
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,760
But anyway...

337
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,340
Anyway...

338
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,880
He...

339
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,760
He...

340
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,340
You could turn it down.

341
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,940
It's fine.

342
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,760
No, it's... Okay.

343
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,640
Uh...

344
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Oh, music is fine.

345
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:45,700
Okay.

346
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:47,880
Um...

347
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,040
Anyway, so...

348
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,260
So, uh...

349
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,120
He still has his appetite.

350
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,740
And he was like, om nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom.

351
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,300
You know, like he was eating it.

352
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,180
But he was still very cautious of me.

353
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,480
And, uh...

354
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,660
And he was still very cautious.

355
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,980
He wouldn't let me grab him.

356
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,160
Um...

357
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,520
And then I...

358
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,420
I like...

359
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,360
I like...

360
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,120
Grabbed his paw.

361
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,840
Because I wanted to...

362
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,740
To have his walkies.

363
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
Okay, that's why I pushed the stream back.

364
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,980
Because he was refusing to go for his walks.

365
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,360
So, um...

366
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,940
Because I had...

367
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,360
He was like trapped under my bed.

368
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,620
Um...

369
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,180
But, uh...

370
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,880
Anyway...

371
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,160
So, I grabbed his paw.

372
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,020
And he like...

373
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,760
Didn't like that.

374
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,720
Because I...

375
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
Like, I didn't grab a paw.

376
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,280
I was just like...

377
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,860
You know, I just...

378
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,740
I didn't grab it really hard.

379
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,580
I was just like...

380
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,060
I was trying to like...

381
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,560
Get to...

382
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,920
Both my hands around his body.

383
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,440
So, I grabbed the left side of his body.

384
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,380
Where his paw was.

385
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,240
And then he like...

386
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Tried to like...

387
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,800
Yank it out.

388
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,380
And he started to win.

389
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:38,800
He was like...

390
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,160
No!

391
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,840
And I was like...

392
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,240
I let go.

393
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,100
Because I was like...

394
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,320
Okay.

395
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,640
I'll let go.

396
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,720
I was like...

397
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,220
Okay.

398
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,280
Like...

399
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,840
You win.

400
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,380
Like...

401
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,620
I...

402
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,040
Okay.

403
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,900
Okay.

404
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,260
And so...

405
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,860
Um...

406
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,840
But then...

407
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,680
Um...

408
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,640
Um...

409
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,880
He was like...

410
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,760
He like...

411
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,640
He still was eating.

412
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,160
And then...

413
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,980
But he won't...

414
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,360
Like...

415
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,840
I got him out of the bed.

416
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,600
One...

417
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
Because I was like luring him out.

418
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,920
And...

419
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Uh...

420
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,660
And then...

421
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,100
Uh...

422
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,540
And then I tried to get him.

423
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,580
But he like...

424
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,820
Instantly scurried back under.

425
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,900
And then he realized...

426
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,400
He was like...

427
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,680
Oh, you're trying to get me out.

428
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,500
So...

429
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Because of that...

430
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,140
He...

431
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,920
Uh...

432
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,320
He knew that I was trying to get him out of the bed.

433
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,580
Which is a safe space.

434
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:30,500
Uh, and so, like, after that, he would only eat if I put the dog food, like, fully under the bed.

435
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,220
Because he was like, no, no, no, no, no.

436
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,200
Like, I know what you want to do this time.

437
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,220
Um, so, um, obviously, I was like, oh my gosh, he needs to walk.

438
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,820
Because I, I need to make sure he poops and pees.

439
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:56,560
So, I had to, um, I basically, what I had to do was, I lifted the mattress again, but he doesn't care about that, because he knows that that's, like, a bait.

440
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,360
He's like, oh, I know that's a trick, because, like, uh, you're not really gonna do anything.

441
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,480
But little did he know, I was, like, fully, like, um, I was fully committed.

442
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:13,220
I lifted the mattress off my bed, and then, you know, the wooden, like, the, I don't know, the tiling wood stuff on, that, like, holds the mattress up?

443
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,460
I took all those out, and then when he saw me, like, like, take all of them out, that's when he knew.

444
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,540
I was like, oh shit.

445
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,920
Like, she's serious.

446
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,460
Yeah, the slats or whatever.

447
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,460
He was like, oh, shit.

448
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,880
She's fucking serious.

449
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,160
And then he, like, walked out of my room.

450
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,020
And then he, like, waited at the door for me.

451
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,860
He's like, okay, I guess I'll go on my walkies.

452
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,500
Like, he's walking.

453
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
Like, it's just, I think there's, like, a slight pain for him.

454
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,520
And that's why he's, like, not, like, he's, like, you know, there's, like, a slight pain.

455
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,440
Or, like, not slight pain, but, you know, there is a pain for him.

456
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
But like, he isn't like really limping or anything.

457
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:06,980
But I know there's like, he's like, you know, he just, you know, he's just very like lethargic and very like tired.

458
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,380
I won't say tired.

459
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,940
Because like, he's more so like, he just doesn't want to really move.

460
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,600
Yeah.

461
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,320
Anyway.

462
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,060
Yeah, so because I've been like touching her all around his body to make sure there's any like actual pain pain.

463
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,400
Because when he had his back disc pain, he didn't even like being touched.

464
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,280
Because when I like touched him, he would like yelp and stuff.

465
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,320
So like, that's when I knew that.

466
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,540
So that was when I took him.

467
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,280
When I was like, okay, I had to like take it.

468
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,680
I knew he had back issues.

469
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:47,580
Because when I was touching his back when when he when he had his first when he had his back injury, he was yelping and stuff.

470
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,320
So but this time, I was touching him everywhere just to make sure.

471
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,360
But he's not yelping or anything.

472
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,500
But during the hospital, apparently the vet twisted his neck muscles.

473
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,240
Not twisted his neck.

474
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,940
Gave more, not just touching, but twisting his neck and stuff to see how he is and everything.

475
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,340
And that's when he was yelping.

476
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,660
So I'm hoping it's just a neck sprain or stuff, but I will be monitoring the next couple of days.

477
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:26,660
If I do cancel streams later this week or anything, it's more so just monitoring dad to make sure he's okay and everything.

478
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,420
But for now, he's just sleeping right now and everything.

479
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,140
And I'm just making sure that he'll be okay.

480
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,640
I did close my bedroom door because I've had enough of him fucking hiding under my bed.

481
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,160
Especially because it's very annoying.

482
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,260
Like...

483
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,340
It's incredibly annoying.

484
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,720
When he's hiding under the bed.

485
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,860
So, like...

486
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,060
Just because, like...

487
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:02,600
You know, it prevents me from trying to fucking give him meds or feed him or walking him.

488
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,380
So I closed my bedroom door.

489
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,020
So, like...

490
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,460
I'm not...

491
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,560
Trying not to let him hide under the bed anymore.

492
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,500
Um...

493
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,900
Um...

494
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,520
But, yeah.

495
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,240
So...

496
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,460
There's no nerve damage.

497
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,120
Uh...

498
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,680
Neurologically, they're telling me that...

499
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,960
They told me that there doesn't seem...

500
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
Okay, I don't know if there isn't.

501
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,580
But, like...

502
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,100
When I took him there last night, they said there was no, like, nerve damage or neurological issues.

503
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,220
Um...

504
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,560
Because everything seemed fine there.

505
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,380
Um...

506
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,140
It was just...

507
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,340
Around the neck that they were like...

508
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,140
Oh...

509
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,740
Um...

510
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,800
There's, like, just...

511
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,820
He doesn't like it.

512
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,140
Like, he actually yelps when they twist his neck.

513
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,180
Um...

514
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,340
Um...

515
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,640
Yeah.

516
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,100
I might buy a dog bed that's, like, more so...

517
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,440
Also, Lana, thank you for the rage.

518
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,100
Thank you, thank you.

519
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,600
I might buy a dog bed that feels like a...

520
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,180
More of a cave for him.

521
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,440
Um...

522
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,920
Just so...

523
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,360
To make him feel, um...

524
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,640
More comfortable during the recovery process.

525
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,700
Uh...

526
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,320
So...

527
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,660
I'm planning on doing that.

528
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,480
Uh...

529
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,260
I guess, like, today.

530
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,700
And trying to see if I can find a dog bed that feels more like...

531
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,680
A cave-ish type thing.

532
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,020
So you could, like...

533
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,440
Um...

534
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,100
Go under in a dark, safer place.

535
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,500
Um...

536
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,060
So...

537
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,260
That's what I'm hoping for.

538
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,480
Um...

539
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,400
But yeah, that's basically the little dog...

540
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,860
The dog update with Dad.

541
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:21,980
Um...

542
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,080
Currently, he's...

543
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,940
I believe he's...

544
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,780
I'll check real quick.

545
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,280
I'll...

546
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,980
I'll check real quick what he's doing.

547
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,910
Okay.

548
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,090
He's currently...

549
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,090
He's currently just lying down.

550
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:38,770
Um...

551
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,330
On the...

552
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:40,850
The...

553
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,790
He's lying down where the sun is hitting.

554
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,250
So he's getting a little sun...

555
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,290
He's doing a little sunbathing right now.

556
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,330
Um...

557
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,050
But yeah, that's basically the Dad update.

558
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,110
Um...

559
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,490
Someone was asking how old he is.

560
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,850
He's seven years old.

561
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,030
Um...

562
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,970
And...

563
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,910
Uh...

564
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,170
Uh...

565
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,690
He's currently seven years old.

566
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,350
Um...

567
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,150
I think he's like...

568
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,110
I have to treat him more like a senior dog.

569
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,970
Even though like...

570
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,550
It's almost there.

571
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,250
He's basically middle-aged at the moment.

572
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,690
He's middle-aged right now.

573
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,850
So...

574
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,230
Uh...

575
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,010
Uh...

576
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,210
Uh...

577
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:11,710
So...

578
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,150
I have to treat him...

579
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,110
He's not that old.

580
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,130
Guys...

581
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,530
He's not...

582
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,110
Oh, he's old.

583
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,930
He's middle-aged.

584
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,950
Like...

585
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,130
He's...

586
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,330
He's middle-aged.

587
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:21,790
He's like...

588
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,890
Oh, he's old.

589
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,990
Yes, he's a hag.

590
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:24,730
Like...

591
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,170
But he's not that old.

592
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,750
He's just middle-aged.

593
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,610
Uh...

594
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,210
Um...

595
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:35,930
Um...

596
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,170
Um...

597
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:38,490
Uh...

598
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:38,510
Yeah.

599
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,690
Uh...

600
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,370
Anyway...

601
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,070
He's like...

602
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,870
He's like...

603
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,150
He's just...

604
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:49,970
Going through stuff, so I do have to make sure to treat him more so after your cover is more like a middle-aged senior dog.

605
00:24:50,570 --> 00:25:00,610
Um, so like, he is gonna have less fetch time, which he's gonna be really... not less fetch, I'll just make sure, I'm just gonna like, throw it really short, basically.

606
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,870
I won't throw it too far.

607
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,090
Um, so, because he's still, he really loves fetch time, so I won't take that away from him.

608
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,030
I'm just gonna try... the only issue is that he does like to jump for fetches.

609
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:24,810
Um, and, uh, he... he does like to jump, though, because like, if the ball is like, close enough, he does like, you know, he likes to jump and catch the ball.

610
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:31,870
Like, you know, as if he's not a wiener dog, and he shouldn't be doing that, but like, if I throw it wrong, he does that.

611
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,790
Yeah, uh, yeah, so, I could roll the ball, yeah.

612
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,450
Uh, Caleb, Caleb, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, dad, my beloved.

613
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,910
So, he's not designed for jumping, but he does, he likes to do that.

614
00:25:50,450 --> 00:26:00,610
Um, um, anyway, um, uh, uh, but that's the dad update.

615
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,790
Uh, I'm gonna be monitoring him just to be like, uh, sure that, you know, he's okay and everything.

616
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,270
Um, and, uh, he doesn't, like, in my apartment, he doesn't do much, usually.

617
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:19,570
It's just the walkie's time that he does stuff, but during, like, apartment time, usually he's, like, more relaxed in an apartment, in the apartment.

618
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,610
So, I'm hoping for that as well.

619
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:28,130
Um, um, anyway, so that is the dad update.

620
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,670
Alright, well, we'll go to VTuber Armageddon now.

621
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:49,010
Okay, V- Oh yeah, before I go to VTuber Armageddon, um, I, during the, during the hospital stint, so, you know, I was trying to, you know, I was trying to, like, uh, get my mind off of, you know, the dad, uh, dad stuff.

622
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:56,070
I was trying to, um, you know, get my mind off of the dad stuff, and I saw, like, oh, Miku tickets.

623
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:06,030
Like, I was like, I was on Twitter, like, waiting, waiting for him to fucking be seen by the, the vet.

624
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:13,510
I was waiting, I was like, oh, Miku tickets, you know, and then, you know, when I'm stressed out, I buy stuff.

625
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:22,350
Like, um, so, when I'm, when I'm stressed out, I buy things.

626
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:30,910
I just, I retail therapy, um, so, while I was waiting, I was like, oh, Miku tickets, they're up right now.

627
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:42,910
And, um, sadly, I could only get standing tickets, and, um, cause, like, the only seat ticket they had was, like, all the way in the back.

628
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,470
And I was like, mmm, like, you know, I was like, ehh.

629
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:55,050
Cause, like, I'm like, if I'm watching, I don't know, I was like, if I'm gonna be at my first concert, and I, I know how...

630
00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:04,290
Okay, I'm sorry, but, I know how tiny the screen is during, like, like, you know, not even just virtual concerts.

631
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:18,910
Like, um, during, like, you know, just concerts, uh, like, in general, and if you're very, in the far back, then the only thing you see is, like, you know, the screens they put on the left and right when they do close-ups and stuff.

632
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:28,630
So, I was like, you know, if I'm, I feel like, if I, you know, if I'm all the way back there, like, I feel like I won't see anything, you know?

633
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,970
Like, yeah, yeah.

634
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,430
Um, that's, like, my thought process about it.

635
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:43,930
So, I was like, oh, maybe I should just get a standing ticket, because at least, uh, uh, at least I could, like, you know, be close.

636
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:50,710
Cause the standing tickets are, like, all the way at the front, but it's still, like, a lot of standing area room and stuff.

637
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:57,230
So, um, I've never been to a Miku concert before, so I was just like, I was just like, oh, man.

638
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:04,230
And, um, I don't know, I just felt like, you know, I've done one standing concert before, and it was for Maroon 5.

639
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:13,370
This would be my third ever concert, because, like, um, like, kind of so I get to go there live.

640
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,470
So, and I, oh my gosh, I could barely, I only went there for my friend.

641
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:32,270
Like, my friend, uh, my friend was a huge Maroon 5 fan, um, and, uh, they were in Hong Kong, and, uh, and, um, and I was just like, okay, I'll go there for you.

642
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:40,670
And I was like, oh, what should I wear during my, uh, during my, like, the Phantom, of course the Phantom Thief doesn't count!

643
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,210
I was literally performing there!

644
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,010
Like, I wasn't, I was literally performing there!

645
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,870
I wasn't, like, in the audience!

646
00:29:48,130 --> 00:30:01,730
Anyway, um, anyway, so, uh, so, I, I was so stupid, because, like, my very first concert was the, was the, um, Wonder Girls concert, and it was sitting, it was a sitting seat.

647
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,950
So, at, at that time, I was thinking, like, oh, okay, like, that was nice, I can, like, wear something nice, you know?

648
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:16,130
You know, like, go to, like, because we were, like, going to go to a nice, fancy place for dinner, before we go see Maroon 5, so I was like, oh, I'll dress nice, you know?

649
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:22,610
So I was wearing, okay, do not, do not, was it, do not judge me, okay?

650
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:30,820
It was a present from my, it was a present from my, my grandparents, but, my grandma, my step-grandma...

651
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,610
But I was wearing expensive...

652
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,590
It was from my step-grandma.

653
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:53,870
I was wearing very expensive shoes, but it were, like, sneakers, they're, like, sorta, like, sneaker-esque type, But they were from...

654
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,430
I'm trying to remember which brand it was.

655
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,110
They may or may not be from Chanel.

656
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,620
It might have been...

657
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,280
They might have been Chanel's sneaker shoes.

658
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:19,240
They were a gift from my grandma, my step-grandma, because she was trying to buy my love, but...

659
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,060
Anyway...

660
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,300
Anyway, so, but they were, they looked really nice.

661
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,940
They looked really nice.

662
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,100
Um...

663
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,240
But, um...

664
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,580
Anyway, they looked really, really nice.

665
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,960
Uh...

666
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,580
And, um...

667
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,260
But, like, I, you cannot...

668
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,940
That was the day when I wore it to the...

669
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,860
Because I never wore it for long periods.

670
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,260
Um...

671
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,320
And...

672
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,720
Um...

673
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,060
And, so...

674
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,240
That was the day I realized I could not wear them for more than an hour.

675
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,720
Because...

676
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,920
Because my feet were fucking killing me.

677
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:19,520
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha The signing seats with my friend.

678
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,840
Like, she was just, like, screaming.

679
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,640
Be like, yes!

680
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,360
And, like, I felt nothing for her in five.

681
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,760
I just went there for her.

682
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,280
She didn't want to go alone.

683
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,580
So, she's like, oh, yes!

684
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,860
I'm like, yeah!

685
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,400
And sing along to the song.

686
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,940
And I was just like, my feet are tired.

687
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,920
And I'm just next to her being like, my feet's so tired.

688
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Like, is it over yet?

689
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,020
My feet hurt.

690
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,900
They're not heels.

691
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,540
They were sneakers.

692
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,340
They were sneakers.

693
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,560
Because, like, I knew I was like, I'm not that stupid.

694
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,660
I was like, I'm not gonna wear it.

695
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm not that stupid, but, like, that was the day.

696
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,860
So, that's what I'm worried about.

697
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,760
About the standing seat through the Miku concert.

698
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,240
So, that's, like, what I'm worried about.

699
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:23,000
Because, like, I was thinking, like, okay, if it's a choice between really, really far seats, then, like, I feel like, like, there's no point in going.

700
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,060
If, like, if it's, I'm, like, sitting so far.

701
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,940
Because I can't really see the screen or anything other than, like, the close-ups.

702
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,780
And so, I was like, okay, I'll just buy, I'll just buy the standing seats.

703
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,440
And then I tweeted about it.

704
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,780
And then I tweeted about it.

705
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,640
And then someone was like, oh, if someone's taller than you and you're in the, and they're in the front, you're not gonna be able to see anything.

706
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,260
And I'm like, oh, fuck, maybe I should...

707
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,720
So now I'm like, wait.

708
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,380
Now I'm just like, oh, shit.

709
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,680
Like, what if...

710
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,840
Like, I didn't think about that.

711
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,700
You know?

712
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,500
Someone in the tweet...

713
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,200
In the Twitter thread was like, if they're taller than you, you won't be able to see anything.

714
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,740
I'm like, what?

715
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,620
What do you mean?

716
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,620
What do you mean?

717
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,440
Like, that can happen?

718
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,680
I was like, oh, my God.

719
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,920
Why did I think of that?

720
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,020
Why did I...

721
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,900
Actually, I just got sitting seats.

722
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,460
Because at least, like, I can sort of see what's going on.

723
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,520
But then I will get a choice of not seeing anything.

724
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,840
And I was like, oh, fuck.

725
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,640
Like, I don't know.

726
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,700
So, like, that's...

727
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,380
Now I'm...

728
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,480
Now I don't know.

729
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,620
I already paid for the ticket.

730
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,240
So, like, I...

731
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,900
I don't know anymore.

732
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,500
So, like...

733
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,580
Um...

734
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,260
I'm like, I don't know.

735
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,480
I hope that I can see...

736
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,580
I hope that I can see what's going on in the front.

737
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,740
Like...

738
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,560
I don't think you can watch it online.

739
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,980
Not the Miku Expo one, right?

740
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,400
Like, the...

741
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,000
Did they have...

742
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,760
Oh, it's too late.

743
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
I already bought the ticket anyway.

744
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,200
I was like, there's streaming tickets for it?

745
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,200
It's too late.

746
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,420
I already bought the ticket.

747
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,780
I'm already set for it.

748
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,900
Like...

749
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,240
Like...

750
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,280
Like...

751
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,520
Oh, man.

752
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,500
But yeah, that's...

753
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,640
Now I'm already in too deep.

754
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,400
There's no...

755
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,460
There's no going back.

756
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,620
I already have...

757
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,380
Have the ticket.

758
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I used my online therapy for this.

759
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,160
Can I even bring a box over it?

760
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,860
Can I, like, bring a fucking folding chair?

761
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,620
And then...

762
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
And then, like...

763
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,480
I'm full...

764
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm okay.

765
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,940
Can I bring...

766
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,380
Wait.

767
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,400
What did, like...

768
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,100
What did they...

769
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,040
Like, they have to look through my bags, right?

770
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,620
What did they take it away from me?

771
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,620
If I, like...

772
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,360
Bring a giant ass bag and then sneak in a folding chair so I can stand on it?

773
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,760
Like...

774
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,900
I have to feel like...

775
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,440
I...

776
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,260
I feel like...

777
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,140
Someone's gonna fucking...

778
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,880
Like...

779
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,640
Like the...

780
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
They're gonna confiscate that from me.

781
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,740
Like...

782
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,030
Like...

783
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,640
I cannot.

784
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,020
Yeah, I just have, like, a fucking folding stepladder in my bag.

785
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,880
And...

786
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,500
I can't just take it out.

787
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,860
I'm not gonna buy a bag that transformed to a chair for a fucking Miku concert.

788
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,360
Anyway, I hope it'll be a good experience.

789
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,000
I...

790
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,520
I...

791
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,040
I hope I didn't fuck up by buying a standing seat.

792
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
A standing spot.

793
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,280
Because it was literally, like, the only place.

794
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,820
It was literally, like, the only, like, seat they have left.

795
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,820
Other than the one that's really fucking far away.

796
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,600
From the screen.

797
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,540
So, I was just like...

798
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,540
So, yeah.

799
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,540
So, I'll be...

800
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,780
It's, like, November something.

801
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,700
November 8th.

802
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,260
The concert.

803
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,420
So, I'll be in Hong Kong by then.

804
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,720
So, yeah.

805
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,760
I guess I'll update you guys in November 8th.

806
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,600
If it was a good experience or not.

807
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,440
If I...

808
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,960
If I fucked up or not.

809
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,560
If I...

810
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,740
Maybe if I...

811
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,340
Maybe within that time span.

812
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,460
And I'll grow, like, three more inches or something.

813
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,140
So, we'll see.

814
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,400
Yeah.

815
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,100
So, I am a little worried about it.

816
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,700
So, I hope it'll be okay.

817
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,200
Because I did have a chance to buy the sitting ones.

818
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,980
Because they're the sitting seats.

819
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,000
But I was just like...

820
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,960
You know?

821
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,520
I was just...

822
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
It was so far.

823
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,480
Like, I'll show you...

824
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,880
No, I'll show you guys the map.

825
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,720
He's like, it can't be that.

826
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,120
I was...

827
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,640
I don't know.

828
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,700
It was like...

829
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,640
Because I knew how not great of experience it is to be, like, that far.

830
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,660
Let's see.

831
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,760
Hong Kong concert.

832
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,540
And I'll show you guys, like, what the ticket was.

833
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:56,940
All right.

834
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,620
I'm gonna pretend to buy a ticket real fast, guys.

835
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,280
Like I said, like I said, this is gonna...

836
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,880
That's why I was like, oh, man.

837
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,480
And, um...

838
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,540
It might be a little bit of a chatting...

839
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,120
More of a chatting stream than a gameplay stream today.

840
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,060
But, like...

841
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,740
Let's see.

842
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,600
Oh, my God.

843
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,540
All the sitting ones are gone now.

844
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,920
Oh, did I fuck up?

845
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,700
The only seats they have left are the...

846
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,640
Did I fuck up?

847
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,200
I hope I didn't.

848
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,160
Oh, my God.

849
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,040
Should I have just bought the sitting one?

850
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,460
Because all the sitting seats are gone.

851
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,020
Oh, no.

852
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,920
All the sitting seats are gone now.

853
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,160
I hope I didn't fuck up.

854
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:40,820
Okay.

855
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,100
All the sitting seats are gone.

856
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,020
So, I'm just gonna...

857
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,880
I hope that...

858
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,940
That doesn't mean I fucked up or anything.

859
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,140
Okay.

860
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,280
So...

861
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,700
Okay.

862
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,380
So, this is the...

863
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,920
So, this is the stage, right?

864
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,060
And then...

865
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,240
The only seats they had left were the yellow spots.

866
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,920
So, I was just like...

867
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,160
I don't know.

868
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,640
They only had the yellow spots left.

869
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,660
So, I was just like...

870
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,160
You know...

871
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,000
Like, it's so far.

872
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,260
It's so...

873
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,520
It's so far.

874
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,300
Like...

875
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,900
That's why I'm like...

876
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
Look how tiny the stage is!

877
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,800
Like...

878
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,320
Look at the stage!

879
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,860
I was just like...

880
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,640
Yeah, you know...

881
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,080
If I...

882
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,900
They don't have the blue seats.

883
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,400
They don't have the green one anymore.

884
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,060
Boy, all they had was the yellow.

885
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,860
And I was like...

886
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,960
Okay, like...

887
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,740
That's...

888
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,980
It's so far!

889
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,840
Like, I'm...

890
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,440
Like, it is very far, right?

891
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,760
Like...

892
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,440
Yeah!

893
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,880
Better than standing!

894
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,080
So...

895
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,900
So...

896
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,040
So I was just like...

897
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
And this was...

898
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,900
This was...

899
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,420
The yellow seats were cheaper than the standing one, too.

900
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,480
So...

901
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,550
So I'm just like...

902
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,620
Oh my god!

903
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,460
I'm trying to bring your own binoculars, see?

904
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,660
Um...

905
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,280
Um...

906
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,840
So...

907
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,700
I'm just like...

908
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,960
I should have just brought binoc...

909
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,780
Then like...

910
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,960
What's the point of going?

911
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,960
I might as well just watch it from someone fucking phone recording!

912
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,180
Like...

913
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,540
I might as well just watch it from someone that uploads it from their phone on...

914
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,260
On YouTube!

915
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,400
Like, at least that's closer!

916
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,420
Like, why the fuck would I bring binoculars?

917
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,680
Like...

918
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,120
It's the atmosphere!

919
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:37,880
Like...

920
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,920
So I was just like...

921
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,640
Oh man!

922
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,340
Like...

923
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,080
I don't know!

924
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:44,920
Like...

925
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,060
If that's the stage!

926
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,440
If that's how big the stage is!

927
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,320
Like...

928
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,980
Oh man!

929
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,040
Um...

930
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,380
Now you got...

931
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,200
So that's...

932
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,300
Yeah!

933
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,760
So I got block A!

934
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,180
The freestanding tickets!

935
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,240
Um...

936
00:40:59,240 --> 00:40:59,740
And then...

937
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,600
I didn't get...

938
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:00,980
You know...

939
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,600
I didn't get...

940
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,240
Any of this!

941
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,040
Because it was...

942
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,820
It was just...

943
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,320
It was gone!

944
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,180
Yeah!

945
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,600
Yeah!

946
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,460
So...

947
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,160
That is the...

948
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,320
Miku...

949
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,700
The Miku update!

950
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,240
Alright!

951
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,520
VTuber Armageddon!

952
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:15,920
Um...

953
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,200
I don't gonna say much about it!

954
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,560
You know...

955
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,880
It's not my place to say!

956
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,640
Because it doesn't involve me!

957
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,420
Or anything!

958
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,580
It does affect the VTuber community as a whole!

959
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:24,880
Um...

960
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,180
Um...

961
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,580
But...

962
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:25,900
Um...

963
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,020
I'll always say...

964
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:27,980
Uh...

965
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,660
Um...

966
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,220
That...

967
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,180
You know...

968
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,820
Um...

969
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,560
You know...

970
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,220
It just sucks!

971
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,720
Like...

972
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,520
After everything!

973
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,620
But I'm really happy to see that...

974
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,100
It does work in my heart to see...

975
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,280
Like...

976
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,400
Different communities...

977
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,780
From all over...

978
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,560
Coming together...

979
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:41,960
To like...

980
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,560
Do what's right!

981
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:42,980
You know?

982
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,860
And...

983
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,980
Bring like a positive change in the world...

984
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,620
Despite everything!

985
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,240
So...

986
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,000
You know...

987
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,620
That was...

988
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,780
Really great to see!

989
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,900
And really amazing to see!

990
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,800
Support all the people that were involved...

991
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,020
Like...

992
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,200
You know...

993
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,560
Support all...

994
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,060
Not...

995
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,440
Were involved...

996
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:55,960
What's the better way?

997
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,480
Support all the people...

998
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,260
That...

999
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,740
Uh...

1000
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,000
I guess were part of it!

1001
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,060
And...

1002
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,340
Um...

1003
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,400
Um...

1004
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,080
And...

1005
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,900
Had to...

1006
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,540
Uh...

1007
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,200
Guess like...

1008
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,660
What's the word?

1009
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,980
Had the brunt of like...

1010
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,760
Everything that happened!

1011
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,960
Support all those people!

1012
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,860
Um...

1013
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,900
All the people that...

1014
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,660
Did make it!

1015
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,160
that were in the org that, you know, would have been in the org and everything.

1016
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,240
I know a lot of people made some statements and stuff.

1017
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,900
I- or that were affected.

1018
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,380
Yeah, support all the people that were affected.

1019
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,700
I'm not gonna say much about it because it doesn't affect me.

1020
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,340
Like, it's not my place to stay.

1021
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,040
It's not my story.

1022
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,900
Um, but support all the people that were affected.

1023
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,560
And, um, that were, you know, you know, after the whole ordeal.

1024
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,540
Um, basically, like, they don't have a home now.

1025
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,200
They're all, like, a lot of them are indie now.

1026
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,840
So, um, so yeah, support them.

1027
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,000
Um, they might not have the support structure they had back then.

1028
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,200
Um, because, like, it's a very different experience.

1029
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,260
It's a very different experience being a company versus being indie.

1030
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,800
Like, I'm still, um, going through a- there's so much work when you're in indie.

1031
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,880
And, you know, a lot of them have to transition to that now.

1032
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,800
And- or, like, have to go back to being indie, um, to support those people.

1033
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,700
Because it's- it's a lot of work being indie in general.

1034
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,380
Like, it's a lot of work for me every day.

1035
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:16,300
Like, I- um, I- I- I- I- yesterday, because of what was going on with Dad, I was able to get a lot of work done yesterday.

1036
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,860
I had a lot of stuff that might be piling up, uh, today, yesterday, because of that.

1037
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,740
So, uh, that's why I'm like, oh, today might not be a super long stream.

1038
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,920
Um, just because, uh, I do have a lot of stuff to catch up on.

1039
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,980
Um, but yeah, like- like- like transitioning to becoming indie is very hard.

1040
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,840
It is very hard.

1041
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:40,840
Um, and some people were saying, like, yes, I did donate to the, uh, immune deficiency fund.

1042
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,000
Um, because it was a very good- it is a very good cause.

1043
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,200
Um, I know some people- I saw some people were like, Girl, aren't you supposed to be saving money after the concert?

1044
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,780
I know, I- I donated a lot.

1045
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,060
I waited until my manager was asleep when I did that.

1046
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,400
Like, I just- I know he would have stopped me.

1047
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,540
Um, but it was- I'm a very spontaneous person.

1048
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
Um, what's the word?

1049
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,420
I- what's that word?

1050
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,580
Not- I don't think spontaneous was- is the right word.

1051
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:16,240
It's- when I do something without thinking, I like to- I do that a lot.

1052
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1053
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,520
Impulsive.

1054
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,860
I'm a very impulsive person.

1055
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,560
Um, when I do- like, I like to do so, like, I won't say I like to do it.

1056
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,220
It just- it's part of my, like, personality.

1057
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,200
And it's bad and good at the same time.

1058
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,560
Like, it's a double-edged sword.

1059
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,640
I- I'm very impulsive.

1060
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,960
Um, so, like- I always do things without thinking things first.

1061
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,620
Yeah, sometimes I fail the quick time event and sometimes I succeed.

1062
00:44:50,420 --> 00:45:00,740
But anyway, so yes, I was like... I donated a lot because I figured it was to a very good cause.

1063
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:17,100
And I know how much I make, and I know I have merch, I have brand deals, I have, like, you know, I just recently got my birthday merch, I got paid from sponsors and everything, and avoiding the Toki step successfully!

1064
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:17,900
Oh!

1065
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,440
Oh!

1066
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,660
No!

1067
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,400
Oh, no!

1068
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,120
You know what's funny?

1069
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,740
Um...

1070
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,900
By the way, I'll do a lore drop right now.

1071
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,620
Like...

1072
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,760
But...

1073
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,000
Inspired Silent is the man- is the manager.

1074
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,200
That's...

1075
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,640
That's...

1076
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,100
Oh!

1077
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,600
Oh!

1078
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,080
Oh!

1079
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:50,240
Oh!

1080
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,600
Oh!

1081
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,160
That's Scatter!

1082
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,640
So...

1083
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,420
Oh, no!

1084
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,900
Okay, so...

1085
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,540
The funny part...

1086
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,720
Was that...

1087
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,600
I'll identify the manager out of all the mods.

1088
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,620
That one was...

1089
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,800
That's the manager mod.

1090
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,880
Um...

1091
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,760
So...

1092
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,600
So...

1093
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,080
The funny thing...

1094
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,340
The funny thing was that...

1095
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,320
They didn't bring it up.

1096
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,660
I know they know what I did.

1097
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,320
But they pretended...

1098
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,700
They pretended...

1099
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,520
That...

1100
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,520
Nothing...

1101
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,460
Nothing happened.

1102
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,600
They talked about...

1103
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,700
Everything that happened...

1104
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,840
During...

1105
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,620
Like...

1106
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,740
The...

1107
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,980
During, like...

1108
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,740
The new...

1109
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,120
Like...

1110
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,180
All this new stuff...

1111
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:42,820
Like...

1112
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,080
Like...

1113
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,320
You know...

1114
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:43,760
Like...

1115
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:43,940
Oh!

1116
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:44,760
This happened...

1117
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,400
That happened...

1118
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:45,940
That happened...

1119
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,840
But they...

1120
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,060
They, like...

1121
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,380
Purposely...

1122
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,620
Avoided...

1123
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,240
Mentioning...

1124
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,180
What I...

1125
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,400
Don't...

1126
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,560
Like...

1127
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,460
The donation I did...

1128
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:55,920
They...

1129
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,380
Ignorance is bliss...

1130
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,360
They say...

1131
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,900
Uh...

1132
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,220
So...

1133
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,500
Cause I...

1134
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,300
I was waiting...

1135
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,360
I was waiting...

1136
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,580
Waiting for them...

1137
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,140
To mention...

1138
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,000
I was waiting...

1139
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,580
For them...

1140
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,680
To mention...

1141
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,760
About like...

1142
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,860
Why did you do that?

1143
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,520
You know like...

1144
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,060
Ha ha ha ha...

1145
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,360
They didn't say...

1146
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,500
Anything...

1147
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,000
I...

1148
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,940
I know they...

1149
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,480
I...

1150
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,880
Not they do...

1151
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,760
But they purposely...

1152
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,200
Said nothing...

1153
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,900
Ha ha ha ha...

1154
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:51,420
Yeah, so I waited until my manager went to sleep before I died to date it.

1155
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,100
Because I knew they were going to... I knew they would have said something.

1156
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:09,180
Anyway, so... But yeah, so... That's crazy.

1157
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,620
Where was I?

1158
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:23,580
But yes, it was a very impulsive decision when I dropped the donation.

1159
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,580
And the amount it was, because I figured, like...

1160
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,520
I know some of you guys were like, oh...

1161
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,920
Oh, weren't you supposed to be saving money?

1162
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,160
What about your finances?

1163
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:42,960
So the thing is, I've been saving up to basically own a house slash apartment.

1164
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,760
I don't know if I want to buy a house, but...

1165
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,920
Because that's so much maintenance work.

1166
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,180
That's so much, I don't know.

1167
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,420
But maybe just an apartment.

1168
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,140
I've been trying to save up to buy, like, a permanent place.

1169
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,920
And, like, that's why I was like...

1170
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,780
That's why that's, like, money I could...

1171
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,600
I could drop.

1172
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,460
So...

1173
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,360
Um...

1174
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,240
And the thing is, I figured that, um...

1175
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,380
I...

1176
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,040
I figured that, like, you know, um...

1177
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,920
That money is going towards a really good cause.

1178
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,740
Because, like, I can...

1179
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,480
It might take me a little longer to save up for a place to live.

1180
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,600
But, like, I...

1181
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,960
The money I donated then...

1182
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,680
Is gonna save lives.

1183
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,980
And, like, I feel like that was much more important.

1184
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,380
Because, like, it's gonna go to someone that really needs it.

1185
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,960
For, like, if, you know...

1186
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,040
You know, if they need, like, medication and stuff like that.

1187
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,900
I felt like that was much more important.

1188
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,080
And, um...

1189
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,120
I figured, like...

1190
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,820
Yeah, it might take me a while to save up more.

1191
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,340
But...

1192
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,920
At least, like...

1193
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,180
Someone is gonna live another day.

1194
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,900
Which is much more important...

1195
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,180
Than, you know...

1196
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,100
Living in...

1197
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
Like, you know, I can rent a little longer.

1198
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,580
You know?

1199
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:04,920
Like...

1200
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,700
I've been...

1201
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,280
I've been renting my whole life.

1202
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,760
Like, I can rent a little longer.

1203
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,120
Um...

1204
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,340
So, yeah, that's why...

1205
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,700
That's why I donated that much.

1206
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,360
Um...

1207
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,500
And, like...

1208
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,900
It was so impulsive that I even forgot to write a comment on the donation.

1209
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,000
I was just like...

1210
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,300
Boop!

1211
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,200
I just clicked buttons and then it was done.

1212
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,420
laughing Yeah...

1213
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:27,880
Yeah, yeah...

1214
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,260
I just...

1215
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,920
Yeah, yeah, I...

1216
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,200
I just clicked a button.

1217
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,140
And then it's...

1218
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:32,500
It was there.

1219
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,060
I even wrote...

1220
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,380
I forgot to...

1221
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,580
Even, like, write a comment on it.

1222
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,360
laughing

1223
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,860
Um...

1224
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,080
But yes, that was why I...

1225
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,960
I donated to the fund.

1226
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,040
But yeah, support all the people.

1227
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,860
Donate to the fund.

1228
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,560
If all my mods can link it.

1229
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,720
Support the Immune Deficiency Fund.

1230
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,780
It's a really good cause.

1231
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,000
And it helps a lot of people and everything.

1232
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,780
But yeah, save lives, you know?

1233
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:14,000
But it was really nice that a lot of people from different communities came together for it.

1234
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:21,980
So it was really cool to see turning something negative into something positive and everything.

1235
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:32,100
But yeah, so that was my... that would be what I would talk about about the VTuber Armageddon.

1236
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,220
That's all I'll talk about, about VTuber Armageddon.

1237
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,580
And just support all the people that were affected.

1238
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,060
Like I said, it's not my place to talk about...

1239
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,160
If some of you were like, oh, did you... did you...

1240
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,460
It came... I feel like it came as a surprise for a lot of people.

1241
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,220
I had, like...

1242
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,880
There was, like, a suspicious feeling for me.

1243
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:00,540
But, like, I never... never, like, you know, thought too much about it.

1244
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,220
And I was just like, we'll wait and see.

1245
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,220
And see how it goes.

1246
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,100
Like, and then when that dropped, I was caught unaware.

1247
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,280
Like, I didn't realize it was that bad.

1248
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,240
Honestly.

1249
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,540
So...

1250
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,640
Um...

1251
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,080
Um...

1252
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,060
But like I said, like, it didn't affect me per se.

1253
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,200
But...

1254
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:17,640
Um...

1255
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:18,820
Um...

1256
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,560
Uh...

1257
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,220
And so...

1258
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,380
Uh...

1259
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,240
And so I hope that everyone can support all the people that...

1260
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,720
That, like, were affected in general.

1261
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,100
Um...

1262
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,480
Yeah.

1263
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,380
Uh...

1264
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:54,440
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b Happy birthday to you.

1265
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,900
Happy birthday, dear Lopaka.

1266
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,520
Happy birthday to you.

1267
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,260
Yeah, happy birthday.

1268
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,870
Happy birthday, everybody.

1269
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,870
Or just Lopaka, though.

1270
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:08,270
Sorry.

1271
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:08,850
Sorry.

1272
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,530
No happy birthday to everyone.

1273
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:11,790
Yeah, it's just Lopaka.

1274
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,170
This is... He paid for it.

1275
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,190
This is his super chat.

1276
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,610
But yeah.

1277
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,710
Oh my gosh, this was like an hour of... Me?

1278
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,230
No, no.

1279
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,350
Don't steal his birthday.

1280
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:24,830
Hey, guys.

1281
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,350
Don't steal... Today is his moment to shine.

1282
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,350
It's his spotlight day.

1283
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,030
It's his birthday.

1284
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,190
Just his.

1285
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,390
Unless it's someone else's birthday and they super chat it.

1286
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:39,770
Then it's also your birthday, too.

1287
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,330
No, it's not our birthday.

1288
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,850
It's his birthday.

1289
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,170
Oh yeah.

1290
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:53,310
But I just also want to add... Another reason why I donated was because...

1291
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,530
I know it's scary.

1292
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:02,530
How you go from something super secure to suddenly having to deal with all this.

1293
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,770
Especially when lawyers are involved, too.

1294
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,270
It is a very scary experience.

1295
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,410
And that's why I hope that everyone comes together.

1296
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,510
It's for all those who are affected and everything.

1297
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,470
Because, obviously, like... It's a very stressful time.

1298
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:17,330
Especially when you're being thrust back into being indie as well.

1299
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,070
And stuff like that.

1300
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:19,690
So, yes.

1301
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,270
Support everybody.

1302
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:34,470
And let's hope that everyone has a very safe and very safe and very supportive transition back to being an indie.

1303
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:35,850
But, yeah.

1304
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,430
Woo!

1305
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,610
Support your Oshis, everyone.

1306
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:40,890
Surge, thank you for the super chat.

1307
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:41,190
Thank you.

1308
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:41,830
Thank you.

1309
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,390
It was my birthday recently.

1310
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,270
Oh, it was?

1311
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:44,690
Alright.

1312
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,850
You better not be lying.

1313
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,450
Because it was a fake birthday.

1314
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:52,550
Happy birthday to you.

1315
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,470
Happy birthday to you.

1316
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,950
Happy birthday, dear Surge.

1317
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,470
Happy birthday to you.

1318
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:58,910
Yeah!

1319
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:00,030
Woo!

1320
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,130
Happy birthday!

1321
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:01,430
Yay!

1322
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,350
You know what you could do on your birthday?

1323
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,470
You could buy my merch.

1324
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,690
So, it's like...

1325
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:10,550
We're celebrating...

1326
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,050
We're celebrating...

1327
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,690
Both of our birthdays.

1328
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,370
Alright.

1329
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,150
Let's actually play the game now.

1330
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,510
Like I said...

1331
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,870
It might not be a super long stream.

1332
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,430
Because I have a lot of stuff to catch up on.

1333
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,230
In general, there's no deaths in Epic Mickey.

1334
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,750
So, we'll see how long I play today.

1335
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:40,290
I don't think I'll be streaming for too long today.

1336
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,490
But, we'll see.

1337
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:42,570
We'll see.

1338
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,990
Let me check how...

1339
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,010
Let me check the sound for...

1340
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:49,670
Uh...

1341
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,050
Epic Mickey.

1342
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,050
Alright.

1343
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,910
I'll make sure the sound is okay for Epic Mickey at 2.

1344
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:00,370
Alright.

1345
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,150
There we go.

1346
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:01,750
Alright.

1347
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,550
I'm booting it up.

1348
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,950
Oh, I forgot to plug in my controller.

1349
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,130
Where's my controller?

1350
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,050
Whoa.

1351
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,130
Alright.

1352
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,030
Don't worry, Appy.

1353
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:17,190
It's time to be...

1354
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,810
I don't...

1355
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,170
Guys, I don't think we're gonna...

1356
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,630
Guys, I will try to get us the good ending.

1357
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,290
But, like...

1358
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,390
I don't know.

1359
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,410
Guys, I was like...

1360
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:32,950
Okay.

1361
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,170
I was curious...

1362
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,350
On how to actually get the good ending.

1363
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,270
Because you guys were like...

1364
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,870
No, you have to get the good ending.

1365
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:40,610
Doki.

1366
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:41,770
You don't understand.

1367
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,590
You have to get...

1368
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,050
Sorry, I should get my water gun out.

1369
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:46,290
Which...

1370
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,690
It's probably not a good...

1371
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,650
Sorry.

1372
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,090
My ink gun out.

1373
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:50,870
Oh.

1374
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:51,910
Okay.

1375
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:52,510
So...

1376
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,510
Um...

1377
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,310
I...

1378
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,070
Looked it up.

1379
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,590
Because you guys were like...

1380
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,330
No, Doki.

1381
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,850
You have to get the good ending.

1382
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,950
I wasn't able to get the good ending.

1383
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:01,470
So you...

1384
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:01,970
I have to...

1385
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,370
I want to live vicariously...

1386
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,090
Through you.

1387
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,250
So I can see what...

1388
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,930
So it's almost like...

1389
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,310
I got the good ending.

1390
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:10,690
So then I was like...

1391
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:11,010
Okay.

1392
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:11,630
How...

1393
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,030
How...

1394
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:14,230
How...

1395
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,070
How hard is it...

1396
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,610
To get the good ending?

1397
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:18,770
And then I looked it up.

1398
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,790
It was literally like...

1399
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,090
Like a...

1400
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,510
10 plus bullet points...

1401
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,210
Of requirements...

1402
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,950
To get the absolute best ending.

1403
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,070
And I was like...

1404
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:30,910
Are you fucking...

1405
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,390
That is so much pressure on me.

1406
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:35,530
That's...

1407
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,030
I was like...

1408
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,110
I was like...

1409
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:39,330
It's...

1410
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:39,750
What?

1411
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,270
And they're like...

1412
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:40,550
Oh yeah.

1413
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,710
I fucked up this one part...

1414
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,310
For the requirement...

1415
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:44,930
To...

1416
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:47,250
To get the good ending.

1417
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,290
And...

1418
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,590
And then I got the...

1419
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,130
The...

1420
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,150
The middle...

1421
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:51,730
Like the...

1422
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,550
Neutral ending.

1423
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,110
So there's bad good...

1424
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,750
And there's bad neutral good.

1425
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:56,570
And they're like...

1426
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:56,910
Oh yeah.

1427
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,750
I fucked up that one part...

1428
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:00,210
That...

1429
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,910
Where I had to like...

1430
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:02,270
You know...

1431
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,370
It's not very like...

1432
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,170
Obvious at all.

1433
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,030
So I thought like...

1434
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,950
I was supposed to kill them.

1435
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,230
But apparently you're supposed to like...

1436
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:08,990
Uh...

1437
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,670
Do something to turn them into good.

1438
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:11,770
And then I was like...

1439
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,890
That was just one thing they fucked up.

1440
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,210
They fucked up one thing.

1441
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,670
Like...

1442
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,570
I was just like...

1443
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,370
What the...

1444
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,590
And then they got the neutral ending?

1445
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,270
So yeah.

1446
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,990
I don't know.

1447
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:26,890
Maybe I should just go...

1448
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:27,790
All in and bad.

1449
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,390
I mean...

1450
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,870
All it takes is one mistake.

1451
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:33,490
Um...

1452
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,150
Maybe...

1453
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,710
Maybe it's too late for me.

1454
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:36,570
I mean...

1455
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:39,390
Um...

1456
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:39,710
Uh...

1457
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,630
Thank you the super chat.

1458
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:41,050
Thank you.

1459
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:41,750
Thank you.

1460
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,490
How's fun?

1461
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,810
Is this enough for a down payment?

1462
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:44,650
And all honesty...

1463
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,870
That was a very nice of you.

1464
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,730
And wish everyone the best.

1465
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:47,190
Thank you.

1466
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,030
Thank you for the super chat.

1467
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:48,310
Thank you.

1468
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:48,950
Thank you.

1469
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,190
How hard...

1470
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,750
I feel like being evil is so much easier.

1471
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:53,790
Why be it?

1472
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:54,770
Honestly...

1473
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,150
Why be it?

1474
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,030
Good when being evil is just so easy.

1475
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,210
And more fun.

1476
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,550
It's too late for me.

1477
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:04,630
Goes all in.

1478
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:06,770
All I'm saying...

1479
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:08,250
Is that like...

1480
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,990
It's so much easier to be evil.

1481
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:11,810
Like...

1482
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,330
What's the point of being good?

1483
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,650
If I can just be evil?

1484
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,530
With less work.

1485
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:19,910
Mickey...

1486
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,210
Mickey would be very sad.

1487
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,470
Mickey is a blank slate.

1488
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,130
He'll be whatever I want him to be.

1489
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:29,410
Um...

1490
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,970
I gotta balance out the good with the bad.

1491
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:34,310
You know?

1492
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,570
I did a good thing yesterday.

1493
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:39,010
So today it's time to be bad to balance everything out.

1494
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,290
Alright, wait.

1495
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,170
Let me go this way.

1496
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,730
I sort of forgot where to go.

1497
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,510
Wait.

1498
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:45,490
That's a good ink.

1499
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,450
And the other one was that bad ink.

1500
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:47,830
Okay.

1501
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:50,490
Okay.

1502
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:52,390
How bad...

1503
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,390
How do I run again?

1504
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,210
Is this running?

1505
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,270
I'm trying to...

1506
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,750
All it takes is one bad thing.

1507
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,650
I got a reputation to uphold.

1508
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:04,430
I got a balance this out.

1509
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:07,590
Alright.

1510
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,010
I guess we go back?

1511
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,230
Wait.

1512
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:12,210
I just skip the phone.

1513
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:12,830
Go directly.

1514
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:13,970
Only 10 eat.

1515
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:14,650
Oh my gosh.

1516
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:15,010
Wait.

1517
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,150
Do I have 10 eat?

1518
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:16,790
I mean, yeah.

1519
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,450
That's like basically 10 cents.

1520
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:21,350
Uh...

1521
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:25,710
Alright.

1522
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:25,870
Alright.

1523
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:27,610
Okay.

1524
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,630
Now we have to...

1525
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,270
What is it?

1526
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,090
Well, you gotta get to the rock into Motor City.

1527
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,990
But there's a problem.

1528
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,310
The projector screen doesn't work.

1529
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:42,970
Gremlin Marcus is trying to get him going again.

1530
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,670
I'd say good luck.

1531
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,870
But heroes don't need luck, right?

1532
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:47,390
Bro.

1533
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:48,170
Step bro.

1534
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,030
Like half...

1535
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:50,110
No.

1536
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:50,870
He's my half brother.

1537
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:51,670
Half brother.

1538
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,510
I didn't know things were that bad, bro.

1539
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,990
I didn't even know you existed.

1540
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:59,790
I was born after they kicked you out.

1541
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,810
How is this my fault?

1542
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,230
I was literally born after he got kicked out of the family.

1543
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:09,210
Was it him that I had to talk to?

1544
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:10,950
No.

1545
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,330
Who was it that I had to talk to?

1546
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:12,650
Oh, wait.

1547
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,410
It's the...

1548
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:14,050
The cow.

1549
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,310
It was...

1550
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,050
Here?

1551
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:19,310
No.

1552
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:19,950
It was here.

1553
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,330
It's Clarabelle.

1554
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:25,530
No, that's...

1555
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:28,710
Well, it just so happens, I came across a few.

1556
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,570
Of course, I ain't giving him for you for free.

1557
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,570
You gotta earn your keep around here.

1558
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:38,790
There's a gang of bunny children that started showing up around Mean Street to cause trouble.

1559
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:43,130
Just bring him here by City Hall and the pipe outside will suck him up.

1560
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:46,470
Wait, is that a bad thing or a good thing?

1561
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:47,350
I can't tell.

1562
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:51,310
Am I a bad person if I take a mission from Big Bad Pete?

1563
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:52,130
Am I...

1564
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:59,150
Guys, am I doing a bad thing by doing the thing that Big Bad Pete tells me to do?

1565
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,950
Surely it can't be bad.

1566
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:01,090
Be bad.

1567
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:03,470
Yes.

1568
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,130
Depends on...

1569
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,010
I don't know.

1570
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,930
This is one of the things.

1571
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:13,010
This is literally one of the things that you can fuck up.

1572
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,770
I'm not Big...

1573
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:17,990
His name is Big.

1574
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:18,750
I...

1575
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,010
I don't know.

1576
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,650
This is a child.

1577
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,810
This is one of the things.

1578
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,230
Oh my god, do I take you to get sucked up?!

1579
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:42,470
Guys, okay, okay, do I... do I let him get sucked up?

1580
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:46,570
Okay, but that is subjective.

1581
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:49,490
Okay, oh my god.

1582
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,270
Sucking good.

1583
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:52,910
Trust.

1584
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,310
That would be evil.

1585
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,050
I don't know if it's evil or not!

1586
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:58,290
Let him!

1587
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:06,550
I don't... No, don't... Helping... Helping make a bad beat is part of that good route.

1588
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,370
They... Nookie is... For this bad fruit.

1589
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,110
If I do a quest for a guy named Asshole...

1590
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,430
Don't... Don't let it suck for science.

1591
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:21,890
I don't know!

1592
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:29,730
Guys, where is Clara... Oh my god, I forgot to give the pickaxe back to fucking Clara Bell.

1593
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:30,930
Where is she?

1594
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:34,230
That looks morally acceptable.

1595
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:38,070
Just follow your heart and you'll get the ending you deserve.

1596
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,890
What if I get the bad ending?!

1597
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:47,470
I can't... Oh my god, he's going to get sucked by himself!

1598
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,630
The fucking stupid children!

1599
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:59,550
Oh no, we need... Guys... I can't... Oh my god... Who... Who had the pickaxe, guys?

1600
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,030
Who owned the pickaxe?

1601
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,330
I don't remember.

1602
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,710
Guys... Is this... I need to know.

1603
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,070
Is this bad?

1604
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:12,330
Is this a bad thing to do if I took the children to get sucked up?

1605
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:13,570
Is it...

1606
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:18,370
Please... Please... Please, I just need to know.

1607
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,950
That just means it's here.

1608
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:29,510
Oh... Is... Oh my god, I came back for no reason.

1609
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,630
Okay, let's go back.

1610
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:32,050
No, you'll be fine.

1611
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:34,170
No, I remember seeing it!

1612
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,830
I saw it in the thing.

1613
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,790
They were like...

1614
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:40,310
Yeah, I actually got one of the kids sucked... I don't remember.

1615
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,150
I don't remember if it was good or bad.

1616
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:46,050
It was either... I forgot to get the kids to get sucked up.

1617
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:49,470
Or... I... I... I... I... I...

1618
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,230
Let's bring the music down.

1619
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:51,570
Okay.

1620
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,070
I'll bring it down.

1621
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:55,130
We'll never know.

1622
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:57,090
We'll never know.

1623
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:58,870
We'll never know.

1624
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,810
It's... I swear to god, it's worth a good round.

1625
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:05,670
Jokey.

1626
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:11,510
I don't... I'll never know.

1627
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:15,450
I'll never know if I'm doing a good thing or not.

1628
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:19,010
I... I don't... I mean, like, is it?

1629
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,490
They're pretty bad kids!

1630
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,550
Okay, we gotta go get the pickaxe though.

1631
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:24,490
Did I return the pickaxe yet, actually?

1632
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,570
Oh wait, I did.

1633
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:27,490
Wait, did I?

1634
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,590
I can't tell.

1635
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:31,390
Okay.

1636
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,110
Oh no, I didn't.

1637
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,050
Okay, we gotta go back.

1638
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,230
Alright, that's just $10.

1639
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:42,810
I played the game several times.

1640
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,410
It's for the good route.

1641
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,070
Alright, let's talk to the...

1642
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:49,250
Let's talk to the pickaxe lady first.

1643
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:50,570
Alright.

1644
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,090
And then...

1645
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,090
And then, uh...

1646
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,130
Is it good to answer?

1647
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:57,850
Yes.

1648
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:00,270
Thank you for the super chat, Cap.

1649
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:00,830
Thank you.

1650
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:01,490
Thank you.

1651
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:02,490
Aha!

1652
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:04,070
You found my climbing axe.

1653
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,170
Now I can literally be at the top of the game again.

1654
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:08,190
Thanks, Mickey.

1655
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:09,690
You deserve these E-tickets.

1656
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:13,370
Yes, I got the E-tickets that I spent trying to get here.

1657
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,250
Alright.

1658
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,490
Collect film runes.

1659
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:18,650
Reels for the Usher.

1660
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:19,650
Oh my god.

1661
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,570
I don't know.

1662
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:21,770
I don't know.

1663
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:22,270
Do I?

1664
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:24,990
I swear to god.

1665
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:26,390
Why am I supposed to be the one?

1666
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,250
I literally have at chat.

1667
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:29,950
At chat.

1668
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:30,710
What?

1669
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:33,990
At chat.

1670
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,730
Do I do it or not?

1671
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:37,950
I swear to god.

1672
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,130
If I get...

1673
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,510
Oh my god, no.

1674
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,290
That's not what I want.

1675
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,150
God damn it.

1676
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:43,390
Okay.

1677
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:44,430
Am I gonna...

1678
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:45,390
Oh my god.

1679
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:45,690
Okay.

1680
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:46,570
Get me out of here.

1681
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:47,470
Yes.

1682
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:49,970
No help.

1683
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,630
Follow your heart.

1684
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:52,530
I...

1685
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,510
Follow my heart.

1686
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:03,690
Do I help big a bad P to do a good thing?

1687
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,310
We're literally just stuck here.

1688
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:13,130
Because I don't know if I'm supposed to let him take the kids.

1689
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:13,930
I...

1690
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,890
I have no idea.

1691
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:17,570
Okay.

1692
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:18,470
I swear to god.

1693
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:19,830
If this child...

1694
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:21,970
I swear to god.

1695
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:25,630
If he gets...

1696
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,290
He wanted to win himself!

1697
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,210
I didn't even do

1698
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,090
a R.B.

1699
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,570
Where did he come from?

1700
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:49,810
I...

1701
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:50,650
We're...

1702
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,670
We're gonna try...

1703
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,560
I...

1704
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,760
The child...

1705
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,600
Oh my god!

1706
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:58,940
I'm

1707
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,310
so...

1708
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:06,850
Wait there's another!

1709
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,230
Fucking mission!

1710
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,330
I thought...

1711
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:10,470
Wait...

1712
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,870
Why...

1713
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:11,530
Why would you...?

1714
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,530
Congratulations!

1715
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:13,090
Congratulations.

1716
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,110
Where did he come from?

1717
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:22,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1718
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:30,230
I don't understand!

1719
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:35,090
Where did the bunny come from?

1720
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,550
What do you mean?

1721
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,030
Oh my god, I told you!

1722
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,130
I asked!

1723
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:50,450
I was like, I was like, okay guys, which ending will give me the good if I take him to the pipe?

1724
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,590
Was it a bad or a good thing?

1725
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:53,750
You're like, do it.

1726
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:54,670
Do it, do it, do it.

1727
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:56,470
It's totally not bad.

1728
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:57,630
You should totally...

1729
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:58,670
What happened?

1730
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:59,710
What happened?

1731
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:00,870
What happened?

1732
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,010
Oh my god.

1733
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,410
I think... Do you think you can handle it?

1734
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,750
Oh, I thank god.

1735
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:15,070
I'll get these in immediately.

1736
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:20,430
It'll be okay if you don't get three out of three.

1737
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:27,210
What if he just walks in like last time?

1738
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,770
Yeah.

1739
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:34,430
Looks like you're off to Timoro City.

1740
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,890
What if he just walks over?

1741
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,910
Because that's what happened!

1742
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:41,570
He literally walked into it.

1743
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,470
He tried... I didn't even know he was alive!

1744
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:51,910
Okay, I just got here but I did an oopsie that may have changed.

1745
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,570
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1746
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,190
Thank you.

1747
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,110
Thank you.

1748
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,990
How was I supposed to know?

1749
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:03,010
He literally just walked up there!

1750
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,310
I did nothing!

1751
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,890
I swear to god!

1752
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,830
I didn't do nothing!

1753
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,930
I have to... Where is Petronic?

1754
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,270
Where does he live?

1755
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,730
They're like, go find Petronic.

1756
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:20,670
I'm like, what?

1757
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,210
There's a Petronic?

1758
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,950
Where does this man live?

1759
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,790
Where does Petronic live?

1760
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,030
Please tell me.

1761
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:29,830
Why didn't you save him?

1762
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:35,750
Oh my god, there's that... I swear to god, if that bunny rabbit goes into the hole...

1763
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,450
I swear to god, thank you for the rage.

1764
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:39,570
Thank you, thank you.

1765
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,870
Okay, don't, don't go anywhere.

1766
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:45,650
Don't go anywhere.

1767
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:48,570
Don't, don't go anywhere.

1768
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:49,070
Leave!

1769
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:49,950
Leave!

1770
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:51,390
Get away from the hole!

1771
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:56,190
Okay, guys, where is Petronic?

1772
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,930
Oh, he lives in...

1773
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:01,250
Okay, he lives... He lives in the Tomorrowland?

1774
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:02,430
Okay.

1775
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,230
Alright, you're not going into the hole.

1776
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,550
I leave now.

1777
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:10,210
You're not... Don't go into the hole.

1778
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,770
Because I don't wanna do...

1779
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,310
I don't want them to go to jail.

1780
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,510
I don't want them...

1781
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,780
I don't know if it's...

1782
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:26,190
I mean, it's from Big Fat Pete!

1783
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:27,710
But like...

1784
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,430
Surely it's not that bad!

1785
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:32,410
Like...

1786
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:34,550
Surely it isn't.

1787
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,730
Send the kids to jail!

1788
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:40,590
Hahaha!

1789
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,710
Oh, that's cool!

1790
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:44,290
Oh, what is it?

1791
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:44,970
Plutopia?

1792
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,110
Whoa!

1793
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,770
This is fucking freaky!

1794
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:48,970
Whoa!

1795
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,030
You see...

1796
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:52,090
I don't like that...

1797
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,010
I don't like that!

1798
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:53,970
I don't like...

1799
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,370
I don't like that!

1800
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,270
Hahaha!

1801
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,510
Sorry!

1802
01:11:58,510 --> 01:11:59,830
That's like...

1803
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,310
That's wrong!

1804
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:02,330
Hahaha!

1805
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:03,390
That's...

1806
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,390
Why...

1807
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,750
Why are you...

1808
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,310
Why is this cat like that?

1809
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:10,610
Why...

1810
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:11,510
Why...

1811
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,930
Why is this cat like this?

1812
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:18,130
Hahaha!

1813
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:19,690
Oh shit!

1814
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:20,270
I'm 1 HP!

1815
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,470
I was not paying attention!

1816
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,250
I don't understand...

1817
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,430
Why is he like this?

1818
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,850
Oh, this is fucking freaky!

1819
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,650
What do you mean?

1820
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:33,310
Like...

1821
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:34,650
You know what I mean!

1822
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,410
You...

1823
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:35,890
Hahaha!

1824
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,650
I know you see what I see!

1825
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:43,770
Okay...

1826
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:45,810
But I can hit the cat?

1827
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:47,890
That...

1828
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:48,530
That was Pluto once?

1829
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:49,530
Okay, let me hit the cat.

1830
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,380
What's he doing?

1831
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,500
Why is there a sausage?

1832
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,240
Hahaha!

1833
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,080
What the fuck was that?

1834
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,240
Alright...

1835
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,120
What the fuck was he doing?

1836
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,660
Oh, this is a freaky level!

1837
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,000
In general!

1838
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,980
Yeah, this level is fucking freaky!

1839
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:17,780
Maybe...

1840
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,760
Oh, maybe it's under...

1841
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,320
On the chimney?

1842
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,700
Okay, yeah, I knew it.

1843
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,180
I was like, it had to be the chimney!

1844
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,940
Where else would it be?

1845
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,320
Hahaha!

1846
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,240
This is...

1847
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:30,560
Hahaha!

1848
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:32,980
This is...

1849
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,860
Pluto...

1850
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,160
Pluto is on some shit right now!

1851
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,720
Pluto is really on some shit at the moment!

1852
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,010
I will find surely the path to a good ending!

1853
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,060
Thank you for the super chat!

1854
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:49,540
Thank you!

1855
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,520
Thank you, Papa!

1856
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,540
Okay...

1857
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,980
Big Bad Pete doesn't affect the...

1858
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:57,660
Are you sure?

1859
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:58,940
Are you sure?

1860
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:07,180
I did see them talk about the bunnies!

1861
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,660
As a...

1862
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,320
As something for the good ending!

1863
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,600
Dude, thank you for the super chat!

1864
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,160
Thank you!

1865
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:13,900
Thank you!

1866
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,080
Big neutral Pete!

1867
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:21,280
Okay, why look it up when I have a chat?

1868
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:27,620
Alright...

1869
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,360
Do I...

1870
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,440
Guys, do I trust the one guy?

1871
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,700
Is it one guy time?

1872
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:38,220
Is it one guy time?

1873
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,980
Do I send the other child to jail?

1874
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,770
One guy would never die!

1875
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,440
Alright, Sunkyr Longo, take us to Tomorrow City if we can raise it.

1876
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,380
Okay, we need to raise the Nautilus.

1877
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,580
You put too much faith into us!

1878
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:09,980
Saw the animatronic Goofy, he was headed here to try just that.

1879
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,620
These cranes were erected to pull the submarine to the surface.

1880
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,940
But then a thinner disaster happened and the effect was abandoned.

1881
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,120
Alright.

1882
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,320
Okay, we just gotta make friends.

1883
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,960
We know how to do that.

1884
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:25,160
Friend!

1885
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,600
Friend!

1886
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:28,180
Nice.

1887
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,340
With the power of friendship.

1888
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,740
I challenge the...

1889
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,080
Okay, we need this.

1890
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,760
And then so we can get that.

1891
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,280
And then...

1892
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,560
Then we gotta...

1893
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:44,840
Okay.

1894
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,080
We gotta remove this, actually.

1895
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,480
And then...

1896
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,420
We remove...

1897
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,320
This.

1898
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,100
Okay, no.

1899
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,500
We put this...

1900
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,680
And then we remove this.

1901
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,100
Alright.

1902
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,960
And then...

1903
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,840
We do that.

1904
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,300
Okay, and then...

1905
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:07,880
This.

1906
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,520
Paint...

1907
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,100
In that gear on the end of the crane.

1908
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:14,980
Oh, this one?

1909
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:18,100
Yeah!

1910
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,160
I fixed it!

1911
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,580
Fix it, Doki!

1912
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:21,340
Let's go!

1913
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,700
What are we supposed to do up here?

1914
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,660
So there's something over here, right?

1915
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,060
Yeah.

1916
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,080
Wait, what's this?

1917
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,680
Oh, it's Goofy's leg!

1918
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,300
I got Goofy's leg!

1919
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,060
Let's go!

1920
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:41,900
Don't worry!

1921
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:42,980
Oh, gosh!

1922
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,020
Don't worry, Goofy!

1923
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,280
I got your leg!

1924
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,840
Got your leg!

1925
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,000
Is it working?

1926
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:51,260
I can't tell.

1927
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,040
Oh, it has...

1928
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,780
Oh, the other one has to work, too.

1929
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,340
Okay, I think there's no fall damage.

1930
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,400
Guys, there's fall damage.

1931
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,000
Alright.

1932
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,520
Guys, I think there's fall damage.

1933
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:12,380
Guys, there's fall damage.

1934
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,640
I don't know if you guys know that.

1935
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,860
I hear something.

1936
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,640
Oh, there they are!

1937
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,480
How do I get there?

1938
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:23,760
Don't worry!

1939
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:25,760
I'll un-paint the area.

1940
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:26,360
Okay, wait.

1941
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:26,760
Actually?

1942
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:27,480
Oh, this.

1943
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,820
Wait, can I not?

1944
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,040
Oh, I have to like...

1945
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,180
It's like, inside.

1946
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,920
It's somehow inside.

1947
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,900
I have to get in.

1948
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,400
I have to teach you this lesson, old man.

1949
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,280
Okay.

1950
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:46,860
I'll paint this.

1951
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:48,760
Alright.

1952
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:51,440
And then...

1953
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,660
Actually...

1954
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,520
Paint, paint, paint.

1955
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,740
Okay.

1956
01:17:58,920 --> 01:17:59,940
And then...

1957
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,020
Paint...

1958
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,100
Oh!

1959
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:04,540
Shit!

1960
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:04,980
Okay.

1961
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,010
Wait, paint...

1962
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,500
Okay.

1963
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,940
Paint...

1964
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,240
How do I open the other area, though?

1965
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,380
I'll paint this guy.

1966
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:18,560
Here we go.

1967
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,360
That should get me my submarine.

1968
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:21,940
Gosh, Mickey.

1969
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,100
That sounds like a big fog.

1970
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,060
I think you need that leg more than I do.

1971
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,460
El, thank you for the super chat.

1972
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:27,880
Thank you.

1973
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:28,460
Thank you.

1974
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:31,460
Gosh.

1975
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,860
Okay, but where does this go?

1976
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,400
Oh, here.

1977
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,500
Oh, it's a...

1978
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,140
Secret.

1979
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:37,220
Secret.

1980
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,600
Okay, but how do I...

1981
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,520
Free the man?

1982
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,500
How do I free him?

1983
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,860
Wait, where is he trapped again?

1984
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,580
Anyway.

1985
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,100
Oh, there he is.

1986
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,540
Wait, how do I get there, though?

1987
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:52,760
Huh?

1988
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,640
Okay, I'm gonna...

1989
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,240
Oh, shit.

1990
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:57,640
That's fine.

1991
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,060
I have more.

1992
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,140
How do I...

1993
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:01,840
Oh, shit!

1994
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,350
Trying to figure out how to get up there.

1995
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:12,190
How do I get up there?

1996
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:13,250
What?

1997
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:16,430
Must be a way to get in from here.

1998
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,750
Must be a secret somewhere, right?

1999
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:26,800
What's the secret?

2000
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,680
We gotta free him!

2001
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,560
Oh, I thought like there was some way from here.

2002
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,280
It's a puzzle?

2003
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,100
There's a puzzle here?

2004
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,440
I thought it's like a secret hole.

2005
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,200
Oh.

2006
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,500
Alright, let's go this way.

2007
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,120
And we'll make this man our friend.

2008
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,340
Friend!

2009
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,240
Nice.

2010
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,460
Now he's a friend.

2011
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,340
Wait, I'll just...

2012
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:58,780
Wait, what?

2013
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:58,840
What?

2014
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,320
I can't...

2015
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,700
Open that door.

2016
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,500
You, puzzles in my platform game?

2017
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,400
What the fuck is...

2018
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,100
Um, I am here...

2019
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:12,380
To...

2020
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,240
I am here to jump, not to think.

2021
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:17,480
This is my jumping game.

2022
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:22,740
Okay.

2023
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,320
I don't know, actually.

2024
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,100
I feel like I did everything here.

2025
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,680
Did I do everything here?

2026
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:32,960
Yeah.

2027
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,040
Like nothing seems like super...

2028
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,840
Like super obvious.

2029
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,220
Like how do I even get that?

2030
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,210
Oh wait, I should grab this though.

2031
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:50,170
Yay!

2032
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:54,470
The base of those pillars seem odd?

2033
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:54,990
Which one?

2034
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:56,510
There's so many.

2035
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:57,990
They all seem very odd.

2036
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:59,670
Oh, these?

2037
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,470
I think I can paint that though.

2038
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,070
They don't seem paintable, see?

2039
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,530
Open up.

2040
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:11,250
Go over the giant stone head?

2041
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:12,490
This guy?

2042
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:14,390
What about him?

2043
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:15,530
Ow.

2044
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:16,330
What?

2045
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:16,370
What?

2046
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:22,330
Your eyes.

2047
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,110
I got your eyes.

2048
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,850
A layer with an orange base.

2049
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:30,130
I'm gonna go up.

2050
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,150
Give me your eyes!

2051
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:36,590
No?

2052
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:41,770
Oh, there's something that gets thin?

2053
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:44,030
That's a lot- Oh, this?

2054
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:46,790
Oh!

2055
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:46,950
Oh!

2056
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:51,350
God!

2057
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,130
Okay, that's like...

2058
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:54,350
Not obvious to me.

2059
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:55,030
That...

2060
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,050
That was...

2061
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:57,910
Not obvious at all.

2062
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:59,990
Oh, that's cool though.

2063
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,610
I guess if it's orange, I can thin it?

2064
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,490
That is secret.

2065
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,470
And then I thin this.

2066
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:14,070
That's right, you're free now.

2067
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,290
That's right, I'm a fucking hero.

2068
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,230
I have no idea what I did.

2069
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:25,290
Alright.

2070
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:28,150
What did I do?

2071
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:32,070
Wait, what does that gear do?

2072
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:36,210
Wait, what?

2073
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,650
What did that gear do?

2074
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,270
What is it turning?

2075
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:45,430
What are you turning?

2076
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:45,810
What are you turning?

2077
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:46,310
I don't...

2078
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:48,790
What are you doing?

2079
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:54,590
The more vibrant the object, the more...

2080
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,030
Oh!

2081
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:56,790
The other door!

2082
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:57,430
That door?

2083
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:58,590
That's a lie.

2084
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:01,790
No, it didn't.

2085
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:04,130
Oh!

2086
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:04,810
I know!

2087
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,110
That thing!

2088
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:08,450
That leg!

2089
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:10,650
Yay!

2090
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,590
Wait, was that a bad thing?

2091
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,880
Did I do a bad thing?

2092
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,060
Oh no, did I do a...

2093
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:33,390
Did I do a bad thing?

2094
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:35,070
No.

2095
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:36,910
No.

2096
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,850
No, it can't be.

2097
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:40,090
No.

2098
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:41,370
No.

2099
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:42,310
No.

2100
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:43,190
No.

2101
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:43,550
No, I didn't.

2102
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:43,870
No.

2103
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:48,630
I can't...

2104
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,590
I can't tell!

2105
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:52,070
I can't tell if I'm evil or not!

2106
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:58,530
Did I ruin some ancient artifact?

2107
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:00,310
No, there's no way.

2108
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,530
There's no way.

2109
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:03,330
There's no way.

2110
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:03,870
I can't...

2111
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:04,550
There's no way.

2112
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:07,770
I ruined like thousands of years of...

2113
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:08,410
History?

2114
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,110
No.

2115
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,550
No, there's no way.

2116
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:11,710
There's no way.

2117
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:13,150
It can't be me.

2118
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:14,450
It can't...

2119
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:14,990
No.

2120
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:15,110
No.

2121
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,090
You must.

2122
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:21,470
I don't know.

2123
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:25,270
I don't know if I'm a bad person or not!

2124
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:30,190
Okay.

2125
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:31,730
There is another one.

2126
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:32,730
There is...

2127
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:35,930
It's serious.

2128
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:37,230
It's eyes.

2129
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:39,630
I don't...

2130
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:40,990
I don't know why that...

2131
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:45,550
If I do it again, that's the question.

2132
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,610
I think I do.

2133
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:51,850
Oh yes, okay, this is a good thing.

2134
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,750
This is a good thing, guys.

2135
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:54,810
There's another gear.

2136
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,750
It had to be done!

2137
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,500
What the fuck was...

2138
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,400
Oh, now I got the treasure.

2139
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,420
It had to be...

2140
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:07,560
Guys, if...

2141
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:08,840
If...

2142
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:13,120
If the British can do it, so can I.

2143
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,780
Guys, the British weren't punished.

2144
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:20,800
Okay.

2145
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,080
Alright.

2146
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,020
It's fine.

2147
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,260
Everything is fine.

2148
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,760
Alright, let's go open this chest.

2149
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,520
What do I get?

2150
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:37,470
Yay!

2151
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,150
I got a silver pin.

2152
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:39,530
Okay.

2153
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:40,850
Maybe that wasn't worth it.

2154
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,070
Maybe like...

2155
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:44,110
Um...

2156
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:47,490
Vandalizing the ancient ruins was not worth a spin.

2157
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:48,170
Maybe...

2158
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:51,010
But for my collectible.

2159
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:55,010
Toki, it's all about the collectible though.

2160
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,010
Okay.

2161
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:11,950
Disney adults will do anything for the pin.

2162
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:14,330
I swear I'm different.

2163
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:15,150
I swear.

2164
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:19,850
What is he doing?

2165
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:21,210
Whoa!

2166
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:21,370
Let's go!

2167
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:27,460
Okay, we gotta go on this car.

2168
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,970
Be angry!

2169
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:35,290
That's right!

2170
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,550
Use your rage for bad!

2171
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:42,910
That's right!

2172
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,690
Use your rage for an unhealthy outlet!

2173
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:47,830
Let's do it!

2174
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:55,900
Where is he?

2175
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,120
Where did our guy go?

2176
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:01,460
Oh!

2177
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,520
He's fighting him now!

2178
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,100
Okay, wait.

2179
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,160
What the fuck is going on over there?

2180
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,180
Yeah, we gotta go this way though.

2181
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,600
There's some stuff I have to get.

2182
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:17,740
Money!

2183
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,060
Guys, I need this to pay the troll till.

2184
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:25,680
Alright.

2185
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,060
Alright, let's go watch this fight.

2186
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,060
Fight!

2187
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:29,600
Fight!

2188
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:30,200
Fight!

2189
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:31,500
Fight!

2190
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:36,880
Whoa!

2191
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,040
Oh wait, that would take me up top.

2192
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,640
But I need him to do that again.

2193
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,400
Oh, that's so smart!

2194
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,200
Okay, I like that.

2195
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,060
I like that for my Pathformer game.

2196
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:51,540
Yay!

2197
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,640
Yeah, rock him, sock him.

2198
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,440
I like that level.

2199
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,100
That was cute!

2200
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:02,720
That was a cute level!

2201
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,720
Alright, I'm in the submarine.

2202
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,620
We're resurfacing, Mickey.

2203
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,280
This is the gateway into Tomorrow Cities proper.

2204
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:24,380
Uh-huh!

2205
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,240
Oh boy!

2206
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,700
Oh boy!

2207
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,180
Can't wait to commit more murders!

2208
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,880
And Val's will open the way for us.

2209
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:35,200
You'll have to find all of them.

2210
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:36,540
Okay.

2211
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:37,740
I mean, that's pretty easy.

2212
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:39,520
Oh boy!

2213
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,240
Spinners are a tough form of...

2214
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,060
That painted shell is like armor.

2215
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:46,960
You can melt their...

2216
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,380
But to damage them, you have to get close and use your spin move after they flip over.

2217
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,120
Can't be turned.

2218
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,580
They're programmed to not like you.

2219
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,020
Wait!

2220
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:55,640
No!

2221
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,960
They're an anti!

2222
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,980
See me!

2223
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:07,510
See me!

2224
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:08,470
See me!

2225
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,060
Oh shit!

2226
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:13,980
Oh!

2227
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:16,740
Oh my god.

2228
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,280
Okay, nice.

2229
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:22,100
A little bot had see...

2230
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:22,800
No!

2231
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:27,180
But I'm so witty and charismatic!

2232
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:28,240
Hahaha!

2233
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,180
Okay, let's go...

2234
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,800
I feel like there's something back here.

2235
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,480
It was telling me to go back here.

2236
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,460
There has to be something back here.

2237
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,640
Because forward is the right way to go.

2238
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:48,960
Alright.

2239
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:53,680
What's in here?

2240
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,200
Oh, is that Goofy?

2241
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,140
No, it's just a regular chest.

2242
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,320
Wait, why the fuck was...

2243
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,280
Is that it?

2244
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:02,560
You're no Goofy?

2245
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,180
Aww.

2246
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,140
There's no Goofy part.

2247
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,260
Wait.

2248
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,940
Yes, in the...

2249
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,420
In the Mickey Mouse universe, aliens are real.

2250
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:18,610
Okay, I'll go this way.

2251
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:23,050
Alright.

2252
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,770
Where is Donald Duck?

2253
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:27,390
I mean, he's still a beloved character.

2254
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:28,410
So, like...

2255
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:29,230
He's not here.

2256
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:31,310
Because it's for all the forgotten characters.

2257
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:32,790
All the...

2258
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:33,990
All the bad ones.

2259
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:37,850
There we go.

2260
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:39,870
Wait, that was like a full...

2261
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:40,330
There we go.

2262
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:41,510
Get out of here.

2263
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,330
Get out of here.

2264
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:45,510
That's right.

2265
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:46,930
What are you trying to do?

2266
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:47,630
Turn back?

2267
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:48,930
Get back over here.

2268
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:50,270
Get back over here.

2269
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,370
You think I'm gonna...

2270
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:52,530
That's right.

2271
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,410
Yeah, get your ass out of here.

2272
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:55,030
Get out!

2273
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:56,770
That's right.

2274
01:30:58,030 --> 01:30:59,290
No bots allowed.

2275
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:04,130
There can only be one AI here and that's me.

2276
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,830
Click, don't run from me.

2277
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:08,770
I know what you are.

2278
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,460
I like the theory.

2279
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,480
The AI theory.

2280
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,620
That like...

2281
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,920
The more AI...

2282
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,180
The more like people use AI...

2283
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,380
It was for like...

2284
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,280
For like art.

2285
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,500
The more it like cannibalize itself.

2286
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,580
And start producing bad art.

2287
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,480
Because it's like copying themselves over and...

2288
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,180
Because there's just so much AI art now.

2289
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,220
That they just start copying each other.

2290
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:35,300
There.

2291
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,800
And then there's...

2292
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,800
That's the whole...

2293
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,860
The yellow tint thing.

2294
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,700
Yeah, so like...

2295
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,880
That's why AI art now has like a yellow tint.

2296
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,140
Because of the Ghibli thing.

2297
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,140
Because they like cannibalize itself.

2298
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:56,380
Where do I go?

2299
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:56,480
Whoa.

2300
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,180
I thought that was really interesting.

2301
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,140
Yeah, AI inbreeding.

2302
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,840
So they're literally inbreeding right now.

2303
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:09,220
Okay, that's really fucking funny if you think about it.

2304
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,380
Inbred AI.

2305
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,080
Oh my god.

2306
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,860
They're actually inbred.

2307
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,380
That's like a crazy...

2308
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,060
AI says.

2309
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,100
Don't call it that.

2310
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,600
What else are they?

2311
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,300
What else are they?

2312
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:31,820
What else are they?

2313
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:32,600
And they're just...

2314
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,780
Where the fuck do I go?

2315
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,220
I'm so confused.

2316
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,960
I'm scared of this.

2317
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,780
Or maybe I put this platform on.

2318
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:49,420
And then...

2319
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,600
Oh, it's this way.

2320
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,400
Oh, there we go.

2321
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,200
Now I'm up here.

2322
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:55,900
Whoa.

2323
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,280
Oh.

2324
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:58,800
Oh.

2325
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:01,500
Oh, shit.

2326
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,360
Friend, friend, friend, friend.

2327
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:02,840
I'm sorry.

2328
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,620
Okay.

2329
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,560
Okay, friend.

2330
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:10,620
Oh, there we go.

2331
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,380
One final gear to go.

2332
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:15,980
Okay.

2333
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:17,640
Oh, wait.

2334
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,260
I'll just cover this up.

2335
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:20,940
Wait, I can't.

2336
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:21,540
Oh, shit.

2337
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:22,000
No.

2338
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:22,880
Don't go in there.

2339
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:23,420
No.

2340
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:25,720
Don't go in there.

2341
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:26,700
Don't do...

2342
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:26,940
Okay.

2343
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:27,420
That's...

2344
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,220
I thought he was gonna go in there.

2345
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,040
Don't do it.

2346
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,760
You have so much to live for.

2347
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:35,620
No.

2348
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,160
Okay.

2349
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,000
Let's see.

2350
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:44,220
That's sweet.

2351
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:44,600
Oh, wait.

2352
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:45,220
Now it's secret.

2353
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,340
And I got this too.

2354
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,400
Yay.

2355
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,100
I shut down the valves.

2356
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,020
You were hoped.

2357
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,060
Like the very slow.

2358
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:55,800
Yeah.

2359
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:56,460
Wait, wait.

2360
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,460
I know how to...

2361
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,660
Wait, did he actually go in it?

2362
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,740
Wait, where did he go?

2363
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:00,760
Wait a minute.

2364
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,520
Where did he go?

2365
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:02,420
Oh, wait.

2366
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:02,440
Wait.

2367
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:03,260
I know what to do.

2368
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,520
Don't do it.

2369
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,760
You have so much more to live for.

2370
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:10,880
Don't...

2371
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,720
Don't do it.

2372
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,180
You have so much...

2373
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:16,420
Don't worry.

2374
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,100
I'll just do that.

2375
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,700
You have so much to live.

2376
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,120
Don't do it.

2377
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,180
You have so...

2378
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:28,330
Don't do it.

2379
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:28,910
What if I...

2380
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:30,910
Don't do it.

2381
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,430
Don't do it.

2382
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:34,570
He has so much to live for.

2383
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:35,010
Guys.

2384
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:37,370
I hope he doesn't do it.

2385
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:38,150
I...

2386
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,390
Alright, let's see.

2387
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:46,710
Look.

2388
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:46,970
I...

2389
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:47,530
I'm a hero.

2390
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:48,530
I stopped him.

2391
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:50,130
I stopped it.

2392
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:53,250
I'm a hero.

2393
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:57,690
Oh, the Great Big Tomorrow exhibit.

2394
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,450
Whoa, what's that?

2395
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:04,670
Mr. Robot has been working on cleaning up for a while.

2396
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:06,050
I'm really excited to see you again.

2397
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,610
It's been such a long time.

2398
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:11,130
Oh no, a slobber!

2399
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:15,970
Defeat the slobber?

2400
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:17,250
Friend?

2401
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:22,590
Means the block really wants to stop you.

2402
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:27,810
The sooner-in-claw's, dude.

2403
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:29,070
He's rambo is trying to heal.

2404
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,630
When he starts out, let him have it with pain...Oh, okay, so, I can.

2405
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:33,210
Don't worry sir!

2406
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,350
I shall save you!

2407
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:37,970
With the power of friendship!

2408
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,150
Okay.

2409
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:41,810
We have to start inhaling.

2410
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:42,270
Inhale!

2411
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:43,770
Oh my God!

2412
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,170
Oh shit!

2413
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:47,630
Frick!

2414
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:48,810
Ah!

2415
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:48,850
No!

2416
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:57,250
Care Bear Countdown, 4, 3, 2...

2417
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,470
Am I doing anything?

2418
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,190
Okay, I am.

2419
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,890
He is inhaling my Friendship Beam.

2420
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:04,650
Friendship Beam!

2421
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:07,790
Become my friend!

2422
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:12,430
Through force, I shall be your friend.

2423
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:15,450
Because force friendship is the best type of friendship.

2424
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:18,950
Yummy friendship.

2425
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,330
Oh look, the carousel is reactivated.

2426
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:22,150
Yay!

2427
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:25,810
Miku Miku Bee!

2428
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:31,650
Behold, the glory of what wasteland can be.

2429
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:36,890
Beings such as you generously apply paint to rebuild, restore, and improve.

2430
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:39,430
Manipulation, my beloved.

2431
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:44,750
For levels such as yours, reshape the land into a better place.

2432
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:47,030
Thank you for taking care of that slobber.

2433
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:51,130
I sealed a great big tomorrow when I heard of the impending attack.

2434
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:55,610
The slobber taken care of, I used my last bit of energy to reactivate the carousel.

2435
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:57,650
The television will be useful to you.

2436
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:58,330
I promise!

2437
01:36:58,590 --> 01:36:59,030
Enjoy!

2438
01:36:59,570 --> 01:36:59,910
Yay!

2439
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:01,070
I got a TV!

2440
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:05,710
Temporary TV.

2441
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:11,520
Everyone's watching.

2442
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,960
He only dropped one TV at a time and they don't last long.

2443
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:20,980
Scroll through your sketches and activate a sketch with LB.

2444
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:21,620
Oh!

2445
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,700
Oh, it's like a power.

2446
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,940
But use them with care.

2447
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:28,060
Each check works just one.

2448
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:28,800
Oh, shit!

2449
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,120
Don't worry, I'll hoard it all until Epic Miku 2.

2450
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,120
There's a power in places like this.

2451
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,700
As if any presbyes decide not to use it, they will put it away.

2452
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:41,840
Wait!

2453
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:44,380
I don't wanna use my TV!

2454
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,180
Is he okay?

2455
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:50,960
Oh, he has plenty!

2456
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:54,700
Okay, okay, I can refill my TVs here.

2457
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:56,720
Okay, that's good to know.

2458
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,480
Wait, what happened to my... my friend?

2459
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:03,000
What happened to my new best friend that I forced him to be my friend?

2460
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,180
It's not like forced if he wanted it, guys.

2461
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,220
He wanted to be my friend, guys.

2462
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,240
Look at him.

2463
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,760
He had that big ass heart at the end.

2464
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:15,620
When?

2465
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,260
TV.

2466
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:22,880
Okay, give me...

2467
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,860
Give me...

2468
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:25,100
Give me another TV.

2469
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,700
Wait, no.

2470
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,260
I want TV.

2471
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,560
Where's my TV?

2472
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:32,820
Where's my TV sketch?

2473
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:35,000
He literally said he'd give me a TV sketch.

2474
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:37,260
My god, he fucking liar!

2475
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,060
He's holding out!

2476
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:39,280
Where's the TV sketch?

2477
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:41,960
Okay.

2478
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:45,720
Away we go!

2479
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:51,820
Where am I?

2480
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:52,980
Is this the place?

2481
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,740
Oh, he took me to the other side.

2482
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:56,760
That's not as impressive.

2483
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,440
He just took me to the other side.

2484
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:01,380
Okay.

2485
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:03,920
Alright, let's grab this sketch.

2486
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:07,580
And then...

2487
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:09,880
Okay.

2488
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:11,100
Off we go.

2489
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,140
Oh, there's more.

2490
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:12,560
Oh, okay.

2491
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,800
We just have to go through this portal.

2492
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:16,820
Yes.

2493
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,520
Scene 2.

2494
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:20,360
Thank you.

2495
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,360
Donnie, thank you to the super chat.

2496
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:21,680
Thank you.

2497
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:22,300
Thank you.

2498
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:26,220
Wait.

2499
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:26,500
Wait.

2500
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:27,840
Oh, yes.

2501
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:28,300
I knew it.

2502
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:28,860
I knew it.

2503
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,860
There's always, like, something hidden in the back.

2504
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:33,320
Oh, I can't even get there.

2505
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,140
Maybe, like...

2506
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:36,400
I have to jump on this.

2507
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,200
Right?

2508
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,500
Okay, the timing for this is hard.

2509
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:42,860
Okay.

2510
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,160
Okay, there you go.

2511
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,880
Okay, the timing for that was really hard, actually.

2512
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:49,960
How do I get down, though?

2513
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:52,860
What?

2514
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,640
How the fuck do I get down from there?

2515
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:00,000
Okay.

2516
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:00,580
Oh!

2517
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:01,760
Because it's red!

2518
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:03,060
I should be able to.

2519
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:04,740
Right?

2520
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:07,760
Come on.

2521
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:08,600
Let me...

2522
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,540
Okay, I don't need...

2523
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,060
They think I don't need that $10.

2524
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,680
That $10 is not as much as they think I need.

2525
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,100
Like, I'm not that desperate.

2526
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:20,680
Okay, I mean...

2527
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,480
I'm not that desperate.

2528
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:22,180
I swear to God.

2529
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:22,940
I...

2530
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,140
Why does he look at me like that?

2531
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:26,620
I...

2532
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,120
Goofy?

2533
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:30,660
Not Goofy.

2534
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:31,300
Pluto!

2535
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,200
Pluto!

2536
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:33,420
I need it.

2537
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:34,240
Need it.

2538
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,640
Ask you about something, Pluto!

2539
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,740
What was that?

2540
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:39,880
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

2541
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,860
I was like, why does he look at me like that?

2542
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,420
I'm uncomfortable with Pluto.

2543
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:44,520
Pluto!

2544
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,300
I'm...

2545
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,120
That's a freaky fucking cat.

2546
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,470
Let's grab the tape.

2547
01:40:57,470 --> 01:40:59,090
Oh my god.

2548
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:04,430
Pluto!

2549
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:08,890
Daddy's concerned, Pluto!

2550
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,130
Pluto!

2551
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:12,570
Pluto!

2552
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:17,190
What's going on?

2553
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:22,570
Okay.

2554
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:25,210
Nice, I got the sausages.

2555
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:28,790
It's okay.

2556
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,270
He has a type.

2557
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:32,110
And what is this type?

2558
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:33,670
What are you trying to say?

2559
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:38,750
What is this type?

2560
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,030
Guys, what are you trying to say about my dog?

2561
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:43,950
What...

2562
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:48,010
There's like a film over there.

2563
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:49,750
I'll grab it.

2564
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:56,820
Alright.

2565
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:58,900
Let's go grab...

2566
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:00,140
How do I get that film though?

2567
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,520
Oh, I can make that jump.

2568
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:02,800
Yeah.

2569
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:04,860
Oh, I...

2570
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:05,800
Oh, it was a secret?

2571
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:06,340
Okay.

2572
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,360
I was gonna say, there's no way I'd make that.

2573
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:11,480
Let the boy dream.

2574
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,540
That's why it's in his dreams only.

2575
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,640
That's why...

2576
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:21,140
It's his thoughts that he keeps it himself only.

2577
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,800
Oh my god, Litte!

2578
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:24,820
Thank you for the...

2579
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:26,220
Super!

2580
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:28,300
Thank you!

2581
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:30,100
I really appreciate it, Litte!

2582
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,240
Thank you for being so kind, Doki.

2583
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,160
That's why you're the best.

2584
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:34,320
Thank you, Litte!

2585
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:37,860
Hey, you'll have to power up the people mover.

2586
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:40,040
Allow you to access space voyage.

2587
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,380
The rocker ride is broken too.

2588
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,320
See what you can do to repair it.

2589
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:46,840
I'm sure there'll be someone around here who can assist you.

2590
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:47,880
Good luck!

2591
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:48,820
Okay.

2592
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:50,640
Wait, are those...

2593
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,660
Oh, those are the ones that hate me no matter what.

2594
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,460
So like, I can't do anything about it.

2595
01:42:58,780 --> 01:42:59,460
Okay.

2596
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,020
Nobody saw that.

2597
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:09,080
Guys, I swear to god, that's not an evil thing to do, guys.

2598
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,440
I swear to god.

2599
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,400
That's not evil!

2600
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:15,980
It's not evil!

2601
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:20,520
I swear, it's not evil, guys.

2602
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:21,580
It's not evil.

2603
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:26,350
Okay.

2604
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:31,570
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.

2605
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:34,230
Where did I bring them to?

2606
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:36,590
Oh my god, they're everywhere.

2607
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:37,910
They're fucking everywhere.

2608
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:43,550
Oh my god, are they just...

2609
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,850
Did they just come back infinitely?

2610
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:47,690
Okay.

2611
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:49,190
Are you serious?

2612
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:49,770
Are you serious?

2613
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,030
Get back over here, get back over here.

2614
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:51,990
I see your fucking booty.

2615
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:53,370
Get back over here!

2616
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,340
Yeah, I need to get this guy out, though.

2617
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:04,960
Okay, he's out.

2618
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:06,920
He's out.

2619
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,620
God damn it!

2620
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,060
No!

2621
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,200
No, let me hit him!

2622
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:10,640
Let me hit him!

2623
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,040
Let me hit him!

2624
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:16,550
Okay, the enemies are getting a little tougher now.

2625
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,090
Okay, he's trying to...

2626
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,250
Trying to...

2627
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:22,030
Not be naked.

2628
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:22,610
Be naked!

2629
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:25,430
Can't be friends with you.

2630
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:26,810
Be naked, people.

2631
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:29,370
Oh my god, it's forever.

2632
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:30,950
Oh, it is forever.

2633
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:35,570
Can I like...

2634
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:35,990
Destroy it?

2635
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:38,090
Oh my god, I can't!

2636
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:40,290
Okay, now that I know...

2637
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:41,550
It's forever.

2638
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:45,010
Okay, I gotta figure out how to...

2639
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:46,010
Get this out then.

2640
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:47,670
Oh, TV tab.

2641
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:48,830
TV.

2642
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:51,470
I have infinite antis.

2643
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:53,450
Okay.

2644
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:56,310
Does that stop it?

2645
01:44:58,190 --> 01:44:59,810
Oh, I think it does, right?

2646
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:02,930
I think it does.

2647
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:05,230
Yeah, I think I stopped it.

2648
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:07,970
Okay, I...

2649
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:08,850
Did not stop it.

2650
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:12,490
Never mind.

2651
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:14,250
Never mind, guys.

2652
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:15,310
It did not stop.

2653
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:16,970
Oh!

2654
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:19,350
It only stops for a little bit.

2655
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:20,190
Oh, I see.

2656
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:22,150
I see.

2657
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:23,430
It's not forever.

2658
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:29,930
The people mover must be functional to open the doors blocking space forage.

2659
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:32,290
We need to see to activate the people mover.

2660
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:33,290
Oh, I have to...

2661
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:34,250
It's time!

2662
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:35,150
Okay.

2663
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:36,750
Okay.

2664
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:38,910
I need to figure out where the three is.

2665
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:42,150
Okay, one, two, three.

2666
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,130
Okay, I found the three.

2667
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:44,570
Okay, I have three just...

2668
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:45,550
I got three too.

2669
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:46,570
Okay.

2670
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:49,150
I got it.

2671
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:50,030
I gotta go.

2672
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:50,730
Go!

2673
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:51,150
Go!

2674
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:51,530
Go!

2675
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:52,610
Go!

2676
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:53,390
Go!

2677
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:54,310
Go!

2678
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:54,790
Go!

2679
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:58,090
Okay, two!

2680
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:00,430
Wait, what?

2681
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:02,010
Oh, shit!

2682
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:05,430
Oh, is it already powered up?

2683
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:06,110
Oh, okay.

2684
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:07,990
Okay, this level is confusing.

2685
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:18,150
Okay, this level is so confusing, actually.

2686
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:21,910
I'm a little confused.

2687
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:26,170
Oh!

2688
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:27,790
You can only place one.

2689
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:28,630
Oh, they stayed...

2690
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:29,510
Oh!

2691
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:30,890
Okay.

2692
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:32,910
Okay, I get it now.

2693
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:34,470
I get it.

2694
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:34,970
I get it.

2695
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:37,170
Okay.

2696
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:41,170
This area is a little confusing, though.

2697
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:42,850
Can I make it over here?

2698
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,590
How do I make it over there?

2699
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:46,410
Oh, shit!

2700
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:48,910
Okay.

2701
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,890
From there...

2702
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,010
Okay, it's a parkour too.

2703
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,700
Okay, it's a little parkour area.

2704
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,920
How do I get there?

2705
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:03,060
Ooh.

2706
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:06,860
Maybe...

2707
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:08,050
If I erase this...

2708
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:11,540
And then...

2709
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:12,620
No, there's nothing there.

2710
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:14,960
What?

2711
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,980
It's fucking...

2712
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,520
Oh, friend.

2713
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,260
Friend.

2714
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,860
Oh, they're wearing Tron costumes!

2715
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,680
I just noticed it!

2716
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,280
Oh, that's cute.

2717
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,640
Wait, friend.

2718
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,960
You guys are supposed to be best friends forever.

2719
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:34,060
Oh, that's cute!

2720
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,080
They're wearing Tron costumes.

2721
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:41,200
Anything down here?

2722
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:41,680
I knew it.

2723
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:42,720
I knew you weren't real.

2724
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:44,600
I knew you weren't real!

2725
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,440
And how do I do that jump?

2726
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,560
Wait, can I make that?

2727
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:56,820
Oh, yeah.

2728
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:00,020
No!

2729
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:04,750
It was close, though.

2730
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:06,510
It was close.

2731
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:11,390
It almost looked like I could make it.

2732
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:15,850
Where the fuck am I going?

2733
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:19,110
Where am I?

2734
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:22,870
I don't even know where I am.

2735
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:26,270
Oh, my...

2736
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:32,090
It almost looked so cool, guys.

2737
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:35,370
It really almost looked so cool.

2738
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:38,070
It really did.

2739
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:42,490
I swear to God, it would have been so cool.

2740
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,370
If I didn't fuck it up.

2741
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:51,470
Where the fuck am I?

2742
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:53,170
Where did I go?

2743
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:53,890
Where is...

2744
01:48:53,890 --> 01:48:54,490
Where am I?

2745
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:55,390
Where did I go?

2746
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:58,450
I'm inside now?

2747
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:00,130
How did I get here?

2748
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:02,930
Oh, nice!

2749
01:49:06,430 --> 01:49:07,450
Nice job, Mickey.

2750
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:08,010
Oh, shit!

2751
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:08,950
I did it!

2752
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:10,010
Oh, I got a shortcut!

2753
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:12,730
I actually got a shortcut!

2754
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:13,230
Nice!

2755
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:15,590
Hello, guys.

2756
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:17,990
I wasn't supposed to do that.

2757
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:22,850
My friend Nova is really good with rides like the people movie.

2758
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,510
I take care of the ride, no doubt.

2759
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:26,610
I could work with those things myself, too.

2760
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:27,970
Dangerous.

2761
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:29,610
Okay, there's friends here.

2762
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,210
You know, you could break your friend out.

2763
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:33,390
You know, you could break your...

2764
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:37,070
You know, you could help your friend out there, too.

2765
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:43,930
Like, did you really need me to break your friend out?

2766
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,810
Like, he was right there!

2767
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:47,730
He was...

2768
01:49:47,730 --> 01:49:49,490
He was right there.

2769
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:53,970
But he's like, yeah, this is where he is.

2770
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:55,870
I'm like, cool.

2771
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:03,620
Alright.

2772
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,140
But that's too much work.

2773
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:08,900
Thanks for setting me free.

2774
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:10,780
I thought I had done everything already.

2775
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:12,680
I figured I'd make it up here to release me.

2776
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:13,420
But you did.

2777
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:16,480
Here, let me disable this dangerous people mover.

2778
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,240
Follow the tracks out through the gate.

2779
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,500
Alright, nice.

2780
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:21,940
What's the plan?

2781
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:23,940
Activating the people mover, then.

2782
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:28,580
Okay, I need to figure out how to get to this side.

2783
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:30,100
Because there's a...

2784
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,100
There's a part there.

2785
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:34,800
I see that, right?

2786
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:37,420
That's the goofy part.

2787
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,120
How do I get there?

2788
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:41,220
That's the question.

2789
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,560
Maybe like...

2790
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,480
Oh, maybe up here.

2791
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:44,940
Okay, wait.

2792
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:45,720
I figured it out.

2793
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,100
It's too hot.

2794
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,620
Alright, okay.

2795
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:53,720
I thought I was gonna die there.

2796
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,560
I gotta get back up.

2797
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,180
Grab some...

2798
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:01,700
Ten dollars.

2799
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,080
Alright.

2800
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,080
Alright.

2801
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:07,560
Alright, let's go.

2802
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:09,720
Cause I think that's a goofy part right there.

2803
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,160
And we gotta save Goofy.

2804
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,640
If we wanna get a good ending.

2805
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:19,380
Alright.

2806
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:20,560
Okay.

2807
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,020
I got this.

2808
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:23,840
Parkour!

2809
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:27,360
Okay.

2810
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,000
Now we gotta figure this out.

2811
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:29,860
Now...

2812
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:31,400
Now...

2813
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:31,700
Now...

2814
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,700
Now we just gotta figure out how to do this.

2815
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:37,020
I'm Goofing it right now.

2816
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:38,420
Okay.

2817
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,180
Okay.

2818
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,740
How the fuck...

2819
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:41,400
Okay.

2820
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,640
How do you do this?

2821
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:43,380
Alright.

2822
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,400
Maybe like...

2823
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:47,880
Up top?

2824
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:47,920
What?

2825
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,400
It's like...

2826
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,660
I don't think I can make that jump over there.

2827
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,160
But can I...

2828
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:56,020
Do this?

2829
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:57,620
And just...

2830
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:58,740
Oh.

2831
01:51:58,960 --> 01:51:59,240
No!

2832
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,260
No, it's transparent.

2833
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,740
It's not even...

2834
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:04,880
No, it's transparent.

2835
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,780
They don't have any like...

2836
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:07,880
Colliders on that shit.

2837
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:09,000
Or that.

2838
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:10,400
I know my gaming term.

2839
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:12,760
Fuck.

2840
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:14,580
Okay.

2841
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:14,900
I'm...

2842
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:17,320
I'm pretty sure this is not how to do this.

2843
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:18,120
I'm...

2844
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:19,900
It's not wrong.

2845
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:22,200
How the fuck do I get to that side?

2846
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:26,920
There's a floor?

2847
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:27,740
This thing?

2848
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,040
Help me activate it.

2849
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:36,010
This is it.

2850
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:37,170
Okay.

2851
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:38,490
But what if that...

2852
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:40,510
Okay, guys.

2853
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:41,630
That's not how you do it, guys.

2854
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:42,230
I don't...

2855
01:52:45,610 --> 01:52:48,410
How the fuck do I activate this shit?

2856
01:52:50,190 --> 01:52:50,830
Hello?

2857
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:56,190
Yeah, but where is the activation?

2858
01:52:58,650 --> 01:52:59,950
Is it down here?

2859
01:53:02,230 --> 01:53:03,430
Maybe it's down here?

2860
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:04,750
Never went down this area.

2861
01:53:05,590 --> 01:53:06,350
Is it this?

2862
01:53:06,730 --> 01:53:07,050
No.

2863
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:08,510
No, it can't be.

2864
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:11,430
It's like this area is like...

2865
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:13,370
Where I was supposed to go to go up.

2866
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:20,380
Oh, there's some gears near the...

2867
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,400
Okay.

2868
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,380
In the...

2869
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:22,700
Sorry.

2870
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:23,520
Okay, let's go to that.

2871
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,080
Oh my god.

2872
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:27,940
You have to think now.

2873
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:29,620
Alright.

2874
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,120
Where are the gears?

2875
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:33,480
Gear.

2876
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:34,740
Oh, gear.

2877
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,540
Wait, that was a lot.

2878
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,660
There was no gear.

2879
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,940
That was a fucking lie.

2880
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,580
What the fuck?

2881
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,300
There's no gears anywhere.

2882
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,880
People who do that just lie on the internet?

2883
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:56,420
Oh, there's a...

2884
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:57,340
Ground thing here.

2885
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:59,780
Okay, there's nothing here.

2886
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:02,120
Anything on here?

2887
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:02,940
No?

2888
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,000
Anything down here?

2889
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:09,720
What the fuck is this?

2890
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:12,060
Where am...

2891
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:13,080
Oh!

2892
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,860
Oh, there it is.

2893
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:16,840
Wait.

2894
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,920
It's crucial to get the main...

2895
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,260
Oh, okay.

2896
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,360
So, we paint that.

2897
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:26,220
That's a lot.

2898
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:27,100
This wasn't at the start.

2899
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,880
I didn't know you could lie on the internet.

2900
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:35,180
That sounds so mean.

2901
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:38,460
Okay, we did it.

2902
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,300
I'm a hero.

2903
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:41,780
Yeah.

2904
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:43,860
Here is this.

2905
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:46,080
Alright, we gotta save Goofy.

2906
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:50,640
Alright.

2907
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:52,840
How is it moving?

2908
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:55,740
Oh, there it is.

2909
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:56,500
That's where it's moving.

2910
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:59,760
I was like wondering, like, where the fuck is the moving part in this game?

2911
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,140
For the...

2912
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,120
Monorail!

2913
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:04,800
Monorail!

2914
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:07,180
Monorail!

2915
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:13,190
I wanna sing that song one day.

2916
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:15,090
I'm gonna sing that at a concert.

2917
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:21,030
I do a group song with a monorail song.

2918
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:21,790
Monorail!

2919
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:22,270
Monorail!

2920
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,080
Alright.

2921
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:32,580
Get out of here, chicken.

2922
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:36,020
There can only be one robot chicken in this world.

2923
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:40,100
Alright.

2924
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:42,020
Nice!

2925
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:43,100
We got his left leg.

2926
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:43,900
My leg!

2927
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,820
Oh yeah, Disney owns the Simpsons now.

2928
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:53,040
No, technically you don't need to get a license.

2929
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:54,280
Uh...

2930
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,680
For, like, song...

2931
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,280
I mean...

2932
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,320
If it's, like, performed in the concert, I don't think so.

2933
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,020
I don't know.

2934
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:01,660
Maybe...

2935
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:04,940
Actually, don't take advice from me about, like, music laws.

2936
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:09,500
I sort of fucked up, like...

2937
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:10,840
So, like...

2938
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:15,120
I messed up a bit with, like, one of the BGMs for...

2939
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:17,000
Okay, so, um...

2940
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,140
Okay, so, uh...

2941
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:20,520
For the BGM for the summer outfit...

2942
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:21,580
Oh, hey!

2943
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,400
Wait, let me grab this.

2944
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,640
Alright, so...

2945
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:25,160
Not...

2946
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,340
Hashtag not legal advice.

2947
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,490
But for the BGM...

2948
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:28,600
For this...

2949
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,540
Like, the chatting screen for that...

2950
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:31,020
So, like...

2951
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:33,240
You might notice I have to put description, uh...

2952
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,080
Credit for it.

2953
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:35,100
Um...

2954
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:36,340
And, like...

2955
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:36,680
Uh...

2956
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:38,200
To put the credit for it and everything.

2957
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:39,980
So, you know, I...

2958
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:42,120
Obviously, because I bought the license for it.

2959
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:42,920
So...

2960
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:43,520
Um...

2961
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,180
In one of the videos, I forgot to put the credit on it.

2962
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:47,360
And then, so, like...

2963
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:50,020
It got, like, marked because it's, like, an auto-scanner and everything.

2964
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:52,020
Um...

2965
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:52,620
It's an auto...

2966
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:55,160
You know, like, when music companies, like, auto-scans for, like...

2967
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:57,120
If it's, like, the credit is, like...

2968
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:57,760
In the description.

2969
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:59,860
So, I forgot to do that for one of the videos.

2970
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:00,380
Because, like...

2971
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:03,360
Usually, when I make the waiting room, um...

2972
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,420
Um...

2973
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:05,700
Sometimes it's not the outfit I decide to use.

2974
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:06,600
So...

2975
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,120
Uh...

2976
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,320
Okay, I'm gonna stay here before...

2977
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,620
Because I can't multitask right now.

2978
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:11,600
So, basically, like...

2979
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:12,660
Um...

2980
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:15,200
For one of the streams, I forgot to put the credit in.

2981
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,220
And then it got, like, you know, marked.

2982
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:18,180
It's not a strike.

2983
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:20,160
It just said, like, oh, you won't get monetization.

2984
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:21,640
Um...

2985
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:23,180
Because the monetization will...

2986
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:24,940
The ad revenue will go to the copyright holder.

2987
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,200
So, that repelled it.

2988
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:27,980
I was, like...

2989
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:28,440
Appealed it.

2990
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,160
And I was, like...

2991
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:30,460
Oh...

2992
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:31,220
Sorry.

2993
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:32,740
I bought the license for it.

2994
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:35,340
I just forgot to take...

2995
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:38,660
I just forgot to copy and paste the credit just to...

2996
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:39,520
Into this description.

2997
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:40,360
Um...

2998
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,320
But it should be in there now.

2999
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:42,780
And I did all that.

3000
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:44,420
But then I didn't realize...

3001
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:46,820
I forgot to press save on the description.

3002
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,060
Ha ha ha ha!

3003
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:49,160
On the vibe.

3004
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,000
I forgot...

3005
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:52,360
I did copy and paste it.

3006
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:54,460
But I forgot to press save.

3007
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:55,680
So then, like...

3008
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:57,040
I was, like, oh, I'm sorry.

3009
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,280
And then I...

3010
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:58,600
My...

3011
01:57:58,600 --> 01:57:58,960
My...

3012
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,220
My appeal up...

3013
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:01,180
Got rejected.

3014
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:03,380
But then they're, like, you can appeal it again.

3015
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:04,280
But...

3016
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:05,500
But...

3017
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,200
If, like, it gets rejected again...

3018
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:08,820
It's a strike on your channel!

3019
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:09,840
Ha ha ha ha!

3020
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:10,940
So...

3021
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:11,720
Obviously...

3022
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:12,900
I did it again.

3023
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:13,880
But I...

3024
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:14,500
This time...

3025
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:14,900
It's in it.

3026
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:15,400
It's in it.

3027
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:16,140
I, like...

3028
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,720
I sent an email to the creator.

3029
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:18,180
I was like...

3030
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:19,200
I'm so sorry!

3031
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:20,280
Ha ha ha!

3032
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,560
I forgot to put it in the description!

3033
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:24,220
But it's in there now!

3034
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,900
And I sent an email out.

3035
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:26,760
Cause, like, they're like...

3036
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:27,120
Oh!

3037
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,040
If you have, like, any problems with it...

3038
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:29,960
Please send us an email.

3039
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,120
We'll try to get that fixed.

3040
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:31,860
And then...

3041
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,580
I sent it...

3042
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:33,880
I sent an email...

3043
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:35,000
I saved this time!

3044
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:35,680
I...

3045
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:36,400
Ha ha ha!

3046
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:37,140
I saved the...

3047
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:38,300
I sent an email...

3048
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:39,080
I'll be like, I'm so sorry.

3049
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:39,940
I...

3050
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:41,140
I appealed it before.

3051
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:46,200
I actually forgot to put it in... I forgot to press save in the description box.

3052
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,120
But it's in there for real now.

3053
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:52,980
Um, can you, like, look into this so I don't get the strength on my channel?

3054
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,920
I'm living on the edge.

3055
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,500
You know what's crazy, though?

3056
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:59,280
Like, it's not even that much ad revenue.

3057
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:00,200
I'm pretty...

3058
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:03,180
Like, I'm pretty sure it's, like, ten whole...

3059
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:05,720
Ten whole dollars to play with me.

3060
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:09,900
Ten whole dollars for a mid...

3061
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,400
That's, like, saying, like...

3062
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:12,380
It's, like, maybe...

3063
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:14,900
That's, like, me being hopeful at ten dollars.

3064
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:18,000
That's, like, the high end of my ad...

3065
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,740
The ad revenue for that video.

3066
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,340
I'm, like, playing...

3067
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:24,660
I'm gambling with my channel right now.

3068
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,120
I, like...

3069
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:33,980
I, like, risking it all for ten whole dollars of ad revenue.

3070
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:38,560
It's not about the money.

3071
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:44,120
All the money is money.

3072
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,940
I'm risking it all for ten dollars.

3073
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:54,980
And my entire channel is for ten whole dollars.

3074
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:59,960
Your life is on the line.

3075
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:04,340
Let's go gambling.

3076
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:09,080
All right.

3077
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:11,180
All right.

3078
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:11,560
Let's see.

3079
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,220
We go this way.

3080
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:17,420
Oh, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

3081
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:39,700
Oh, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum,

3082
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:50,700
ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum For five dollars.

3083
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:53,100
Next to you.

3084
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,320
Thank you for the super chat.

3085
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:54,780
Thank you.

3086
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,640
Thank you.

3087
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:04,850
I try to help and generally do not mean to mislead you.

3088
02:01:04,970 --> 02:01:06,510
Don't keep upset on the first stream.

3089
02:01:06,710 --> 02:01:07,730
I get laughed.

3090
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:08,450
Wait, what?

3091
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:12,730
Wait.

3092
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:15,030
I don't even remember that.

3093
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:17,350
Don't worry, Alex.

3094
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,850
I laugh at everybody.

3095
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:21,150
Don't worry.

3096
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:25,890
Okay, wait.

3097
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:26,610
What is he doing?

3098
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:29,810
What the fuck?

3099
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:30,410
Oh my god.

3100
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:32,450
He's beating up the fucking monkey.

3101
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:34,630
I mean, is that legal?

3102
02:01:35,130 --> 02:01:35,870
Look, he's dead.

3103
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:37,210
Bro, he's dead.

3104
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:37,910
Where's the ref?

3105
02:01:38,770 --> 02:01:39,690
Where's the ref?

3106
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:41,010
Where the fuck is he?

3107
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:44,030
Guys, ref, where the fuck?

3108
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:44,590
He's dead.

3109
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:45,050
Please.

3110
02:01:45,390 --> 02:01:46,570
Someone stop him.

3111
02:01:47,230 --> 02:01:47,950
He's dead.

3112
02:01:47,950 --> 02:01:48,070
He's dead.

3113
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:52,410
Okay.

3114
02:01:53,830 --> 02:01:56,190
Bro, he won't tap out.

3115
02:01:58,050 --> 02:01:58,770
Please.

3116
02:01:59,110 --> 02:01:59,670
He's dead.

3117
02:02:00,070 --> 02:02:01,050
Someone stop.

3118
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,820
Oh shit.

3119
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:04,820
Wait, that hurts me.

3120
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:10,080
Nah, you didn't box it anymore.

3121
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,560
He didn't hear no bell.

3122
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,020
Where the fuck is the ref?

3123
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:23,530
All right, here we go.

3124
02:02:29,350 --> 02:02:31,430
I entered the space voyage.

3125
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,000
Fight back.

3126
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:44,380
There are pipes we need to repair in there.

3127
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:45,640
It's rotating.

3128
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:47,000
Great.

3129
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:49,940
Beetleworks Tinker can fire barrage with thinner paint.

3130
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:51,440
And it's guarding the elevator.

3131
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:54,320
The one we need to ride atop of space voyage.

3132
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:55,080
Oh, hey.

3133
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:55,740
There's a hen.

3134
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,080
Let me think.

3135
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:03,060
When those pistons are working in sequence, you can climb them to the elevator.

3136
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:05,040
I got it.

3137
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:06,820
Now you can take through the people's mover.

3138
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:08,000
Avoid the electric fence.

3139
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,340
Find and break down the hatch.

3140
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:09,760
Then repair.

3141
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:10,660
Jesus Christ.

3142
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:11,900
That was so easy.

3143
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:13,160
Wow.

3144
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:14,360
Wow, sir.

3145
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:17,120
That sounded so fucking easy.

3146
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:18,240
Oh my god.

3147
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,080
Excuse me?

3148
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:25,060
I have to do what and what and also what now?

3149
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:31,530
What's over here?

3150
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:34,510
What do I do?

3151
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:36,610
Oh, shit.

3152
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:39,330
Where is it taking me?

3153
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,420
Where am I?

3154
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:45,600
Oh, shit.

3155
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:46,520
That's where I am.

3156
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,700
I was like, where the fuck is this taking me?

3157
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:52,740
This is not part of the plan that this guy gave me.

3158
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:55,260
He's like, you're supposed to do this and that.

3159
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:56,500
And then I'm like, see ya.

3160
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:58,500
Well, I'll go here instead.

3161
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:04,020
Alright.

3162
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:06,480
Where am I?

3163
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:11,420
Actually, where am I?

3164
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:19,320
TV.

3165
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:24,010
What did I do?

3166
02:04:27,990 --> 02:04:28,710
Okay.

3167
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:31,890
Where was that?

3168
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:35,810
Oh, it's over there.

3169
02:04:37,190 --> 02:04:38,510
How did I get there, though?

3170
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:40,090
I have so many questions.

3171
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:45,010
Okay, so I have to go down from here.

3172
02:04:47,410 --> 02:04:48,210
And then...

3173
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:48,750
Clearly...

3174
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:49,070
Oh, shit.

3175
02:04:49,110 --> 02:04:50,350
I did not mean to put a TV there.

3176
02:04:51,610 --> 02:04:52,010
Really?

3177
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:53,510
That's something?

3178
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:55,210
There's something down here?

3179
02:04:57,950 --> 02:04:58,350
There.

3180
02:04:59,030 --> 02:04:59,870
I hear something.

3181
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:00,670
Oh, there he is.

3182
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:02,030
I know.

3183
02:05:02,170 --> 02:05:02,930
Get out of here.

3184
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:05,470
I can shut down one of the viewers' generator.

3185
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:06,990
Or I can give you three TVs.

3186
02:05:08,050 --> 02:05:08,450
Uh...

3187
02:05:08,450 --> 02:05:09,910
No, I don't need a TV.

3188
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:13,410
Yeah, you know what?

3189
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,250
No, that's easier.

3190
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:14,550
No.

3191
02:05:14,830 --> 02:05:15,490
Yeah, that's easy.

3192
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:16,450
That's a lot easier.

3193
02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:18,210
Yeah, break that thing.

3194
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:23,080
Okay.

3195
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:26,000
We, uh...

3196
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,780
Free TV sounds cool.

3197
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:31,760
Guys, we don't need another TV, guys.

3198
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:34,820
I know how to get back up top, though.

3199
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:37,540
Friend.

3200
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:40,360
That's right.

3201
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:41,320
And he'll never know.

3202
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,300
He'll never know I forced him to be my friend.

3203
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:49,880
Okay.

3204
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:51,440
Oh, my God.

3205
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:52,980
I'm a little confused right now.

3206
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:54,780
But I got spirit.

3207
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:00,570
What's this?

3208
02:06:01,790 --> 02:06:02,210
Nice.

3209
02:06:03,850 --> 02:06:05,490
How do I get the other...

3210
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:06,270
Oh, there it is.

3211
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:07,510
Wait, how do I...

3212
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:08,090
Wait, no.

3213
02:06:08,210 --> 02:06:09,470
Actually, how do I...

3214
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:10,750
How do I get back?

3215
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:13,170
Ow.

3216
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:15,810
Okay, I'm, like, clearly shorter than this.

3217
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:16,550
Okay, this way.

3218
02:06:17,610 --> 02:06:19,750
Okay, I need to do this, too.

3219
02:06:19,970 --> 02:06:20,450
But...

3220
02:06:20,450 --> 02:06:22,170
How do I get that part?

3221
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:24,950
That has to be, like...

3222
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:26,250
The goofy part, too.

3223
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:31,160
Okay.

3224
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:32,440
This is fine.

3225
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:34,440
This?

3226
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:35,400
Can I thin that?

3227
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:36,800
That seems thinnable.

3228
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:40,060
Right?

3229
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:41,480
No?

3230
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,320
Okay.

3231
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,900
I'm confused, but I have spirit.

3232
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:50,880
Okay.

3233
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:52,140
Go this way.

3234
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:54,760
Hello.

3235
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:57,080
Oh, I have to go down from here.

3236
02:06:57,320 --> 02:06:57,500
Okay.

3237
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,780
Okay, before we do that, though...

3238
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:02,740
There is...

3239
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:03,300
Okay, wait.

3240
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,180
I can go down from here.

3241
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:07,780
Oh, shit.

3242
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:08,400
What the fuck?

3243
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,600
He was, like, just naked.

3244
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,620
Without me being there.

3245
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:15,780
Fucking freaky.

3246
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:21,420
Freaky ass chickens.

3247
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:26,000
He was, like, naked with all the other chickens.

3248
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:27,320
So fucking freaky.

3249
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:29,000
Hey, you saw that?

3250
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:29,880
I dropped down.

3251
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:30,800
He was already naked.

3252
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,060
And he was, like, oh my god.

3253
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:32,920
It's not for you.

3254
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,300
And then he put his clothes back on.

3255
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,480
Yeah.

3256
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:42,160
Freaky ass chicken.

3257
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:46,000
And this was their private time.

3258
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,700
That's messed up, Doki.

3259
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:53,380
You interrupted their private time.

3260
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:56,460
Freaky ass chicken.

3261
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:58,600
Wait, what?

3262
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:01,160
How do I get in...

3263
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:02,240
How do I get there?

3264
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:07,900
Wait.

3265
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:11,420
How do I get that part?

3266
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:15,640
I got a sketch, though.

3267
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:17,920
I got a rocket.

3268
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:21,160
Wait, that's clearly...

3269
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:22,160
You can do that.

3270
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:25,000
What does this do?

3271
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,620
What did it do?

3272
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:35,900
Oh, this.

3273
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:37,860
I was, like...

3274
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:39,700
Where is it taking me?

3275
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:41,500
Oh, nice.

3276
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:42,340
I got an arm, though.

3277
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:45,240
Got your arm.

3278
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,420
There's a clamp I can thin.

3279
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:53,820
Oh, shit.

3280
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:54,300
That's...

3281
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,320
Oh, that's the wrong one.

3282
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:57,640
Sorry.

3283
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:58,580
I meant to be here.

3284
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:02,300
I was looking at the wrong one.

3285
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:02,660
Whoops.

3286
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,040
Okay, now I got...

3287
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,200
Oh, wait.

3288
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:10,920
Oh, it's Pluto's dog tag.

3289
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:13,600
I got your nose.

3290
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:18,080
Oh, I got, like, an extra quest.

3291
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:23,120
Okay, we got, uh...

3292
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:24,040
Okay, we got, uh...

3293
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:26,860
We got to go...

3294
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:27,580
You know what?

3295
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:28,620
I'm tired of this outfit.

3296
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:29,640
I want to change clothes.

3297
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:33,860
I want me Steamboat Willie now.

3298
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:36,240
Because I'm public domain, baby.

3299
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:43,780
Oh, I didn't give it to Horace in Main Street?

3300
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:45,260
What is he gonna do with it?

3301
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:49,340
Is it his freaky time?

3302
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:50,180
Is that...

3303
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:51,900
Is that...

3304
02:09:54,710 --> 02:09:55,830
Why Horace?

3305
02:09:58,470 --> 02:10:01,150
What is he gonna do with the collar?

3306
02:10:03,510 --> 02:10:05,250
Is it supposed to come down?

3307
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:07,290
Oh, there it is.

3308
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:12,310
He misses his wife.

3309
02:10:16,010 --> 02:10:17,530
Alright, up I go.

3310
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,410
Yay!

3311
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:24,730
I go up now.

3312
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:26,130
Yay!

3313
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:28,870
Alright.

3314
02:10:29,050 --> 02:10:29,830
Oh, I hear you.

3315
02:10:33,810 --> 02:10:36,670
I can stop one, be the worst, share, give you three TVs.

3316
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:38,070
I already have three TVs.

3317
02:10:39,150 --> 02:10:41,230
And then, where the fuck are all of these two?

3318
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:44,450
I feel like I'm not bumped into any of these generators.

3319
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:51,380
Is that it?

3320
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,480
Is that all there is?

3321
02:10:57,670 --> 02:10:58,070
Yeah.

3322
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:01,050
Where does this go?

3323
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:05,070
What the fuck am I supposed to be doing up here?

3324
02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:06,690
What the fuck am I supposed to be doing up here?

3325
02:11:06,690 --> 02:11:07,410
I guess that was it.

3326
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:08,850
Ah, okay.

3327
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:14,670
Alright.

3328
02:11:15,670 --> 02:11:16,610
That was easy.

3329
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:21,140
Okay.

3330
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:24,300
Is this part of it?

3331
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:24,600
Hello?

3332
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:26,280
Whoa!

3333
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:27,920
No!

3334
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:28,540
Stop!

3335
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:29,460
Stop!

3336
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:31,340
Stop!

3337
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:35,160
Bad!

3338
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:37,880
Bad!

3339
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:38,660
Stop being bad!

3340
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:41,420
Get a hobby!

3341
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,940
There's more to life than being an anti!

3342
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,080
Stop!

3343
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:48,120
Oh, shit!

3344
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:51,020
Yeah.

3345
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:53,580
Get a life!

3346
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:55,400
Get a life!

3347
02:12:05,940 --> 02:12:08,080
Alright, that should kill him.

3348
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:08,840
Nice!

3349
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:10,720
Yay!

3350
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:18,420
You don't understand the absolute joy about being an anti!

3351
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:29,660
A bro is dedicated!

3352
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:31,640
He doesn't care!

3353
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,960
He was dedicated until the end.

3354
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:47,940
Is something wrong?

3355
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:53,100
Yeah, on the Moonliner rocket, a gremlin told me the mad doctor sabotaged it.

3356
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:56,160
This thing parsed for his terrible machines.

3357
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:59,420
I should never let him build those be.

3358
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:02,120
When he stood apart, did he say nyah-ha-ha?

3359
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,300
Nyah-ha-ha.

3360
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:07,520
Yeah, he didn't.

3361
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:07,920
Why?

3362
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:11,060
Nyah-ha-ha always means bad news.

3363
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:14,400
Listen, Mouse, you have to recover those stolen rocket parts.

3364
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:16,220
One part is being held by Petronic.

3365
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:17,400
Start with him.

3366
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:21,640
Others are Lonesome Manor and Tortuga.

3367
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:22,840
Tortuga?

3368
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:27,580
Wait, that's like...

3369
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,360
Where's Tortuga?

3370
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:29,820
Wait, no.

3371
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:31,080
That's from a movie, right?

3372
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:33,280
Meet me at Mickey Junk Mountain.

3373
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,200
Where is that?

3374
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:38,080
That's so familiar.

3375
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:41,340
Is that Pius the Caribbean?

3376
02:13:48,290 --> 02:13:50,170
Yeah, it's like... That's so familiar.

3377
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:57,340
I gotta go to Tortuga.

3378
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:01,260
It's the next rocket piece you need.

3379
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:02,900
Oh my god, it is Tron!

3380
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,760
Hurry up and grab it as soon as you can.

3381
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:06,540
Uh-huh!

3382
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:07,180
Okay.

3383
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:10,660
Petronic?

3384
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:12,040
Where are you?

3385
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:22,780
Hello?

3386
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:28,060
You seem like a very nice guy.

3387
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:30,600
Welcome to Space Voyage, Mickey.

3388
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:34,440
Hope you're ready to see stars if you get my drift.

3389
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:37,100
Say hello to Petronic.

3390
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:39,340
I am master of this arena.

3391
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:43,680
And with my argumentations, you ain't got a chance, Mickey.

3392
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:45,820
I always win here.

3393
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:48,880
I need to defeat Petronic or Brefenin, Mickey.

3394
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:50,720
FRIEND!

3395
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:53,420
FRIEND!

3396
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:55,280
Oh my god, guys.

3397
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:56,680
I don't know if it's working.

3398
02:14:57,180 --> 02:14:58,620
Guys, I cannot tell.

3399
02:14:59,140 --> 02:14:59,580
I...

3400
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,180
Oh no.

3401
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:04,120
Oh no, I ran out of...

3402
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:06,960
Oh.

3403
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:08,100
Oh.

3404
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:09,460
Oh, that might not be a friend thing.

3405
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:09,860
Oh wait, no.

3406
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:10,180
It is!

3407
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:10,580
It is!

3408
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:11,000
Oh, okay.

3409
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:13,060
Okay, I just gotta fill it up.

3410
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:14,580
Here we go.

3411
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:15,840
Okay, I got it.

3412
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:16,700
I figured it out.

3413
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:21,840
Oh my god, he's blue now.

3414
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:23,500
I think we're best friends.

3415
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:29,220
Cause that's what best friends do, right?

3416
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,260
We just do a little...

3417
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:32,860
Sometimes we hit each other.

3418
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:35,240
That's what best friends do.

3419
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:41,880
Sometimes you gotta force feed them some friendship juice.

3420
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:48,700
Sometimes you gotta force your friend to ingest some friendship juice.

3421
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,220
If they know what's good for them.

3422
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:55,950
FRIEND!

3423
02:15:58,010 --> 02:15:58,690

02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:16,590
FRIEND!

3438
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:19,530
FRIEND!

3439
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:20,150
What is ZZ?

3440
02:16:20,370 --> 02:16:21,410
It's just three strikes.

3441
02:16:21,670 --> 02:16:22,690
It's Mario lost.

3442
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:27,290
Oh my god, he missed, stupid.

3443
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:31,520
Okay.

3444
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:33,680
Friendship this time.

3445
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:34,760
Ultimate Frisbee.

3446
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:36,600
Take my juice, Pete.

3447
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:43,040
Okay.

3448
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:46,660
Okay, that's not good, but that's okay.

3449
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:50,860
Oh shit.

3450
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:53,980
It's like Pong.

3451
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:56,980
But like, for babies.

3452
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,820
Oh my god, it is like Pong.

3453
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:05,540
Alright, come on.

3454
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:07,160
Do a thing.

3455
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:09,480
Haha, that's Rookie, right?

3456
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:10,940
Haha, oh shit.

3457
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:13,980
Haha, that's right.

3458
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:16,260
Alright.

3459
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:20,100
Ultimate Frisbee time.

3460
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,120
Three strikes and you're out.

3461
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:26,560
Yay!

3462
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:28,360
That's it.

3463
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:30,120
Show this back as friendship juice.

3464
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:31,000
Friend!

3465
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:36,570
Yay!

3466
02:17:36,570 --> 02:17:36,850
Yay!

3467
02:17:39,350 --> 02:17:41,470
Wow, I lost my head for a while.

3468
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:43,330
Here, take this disc, will ya?

3469
02:17:43,530 --> 02:17:44,790
I don't need it anymore.

3470
02:17:45,650 --> 02:17:47,550
I'm gonna see if I can get tomorrow's city cleaned up.

3471
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:50,050
Tell Big Bad Pete I said hi, will ya?

3472
02:17:51,170 --> 02:17:51,570
Yay!

3473
02:17:52,290 --> 02:17:56,010
With a black shot in my friendship juice.

3474
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:57,930
You redeemed Petronic.

3475
02:17:58,370 --> 02:18:01,490
He's very powerful and I'll use that power to help Wasteland.

3476
02:18:01,950 --> 02:18:02,330
Hurrah!

3477
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:08,150
Your paint or thinner capacity can change based on how you deal with important characters in Wasteland.

3478
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:09,050
Yay!

3479
02:18:09,930 --> 02:18:11,490
Friendship is magic!

3480
02:18:14,150 --> 02:18:15,650
Let's fire the rocket.

3481
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:16,610
Yippee!

3482
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:20,250
Collected all the rocket parts.

3483
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:20,790
Let's go.

3484
02:18:21,990 --> 02:18:22,590
Yes.

3485
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:29,820
That's a good friend.

3486
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:30,200
See?

3487
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:32,120
He enjoyed it.

3488
02:18:33,180 --> 02:18:33,620
Uh...

3489
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:35,040
Thank you for the super chat thing.

3490
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:35,600
Thank you.

3491
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:42,420
The OGTV sketch used to have the now public domain steamboat Mickey whistling on them.

3492
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:43,340
Oh, that's cool.

3493
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:44,900
Thank you for the super chat thing.

3494
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,640
Thank you.

3495
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:47,320
Hey, Mouse.

3496
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:48,800
It's about time you showed up.

3497
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,460
The next rocket part to find is in Venture Line.

3498
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:53,400
But the projector screen is out of order.

3499
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:56,400
Gremlin Marcus is the only one who can fix it.

3500
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:58,600
But he's been tracked by splatters.

3501
02:18:58,820 --> 02:18:59,600
Wait, they're here?

3502
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:02,080
You're gonna need to help him.

3503
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:03,360
I'd do it myself.

3504
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:05,860
I'll see how- just how you'll handle the situation.

3505
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:07,080
Get to it.

3506
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:08,580
Wait, how did he get here?

3507
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:12,280
What the fuck?

3508
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:13,460
They're in Mean Street?

3509
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:16,060
This is my sit- city.

3510
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:17,200
Get out of here.

3511
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:18,920
Friendship!

3512
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:26,880
Okay, we just got- Forced to be friends with one last guy.

3513
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:29,200
Yeah.

3514
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:31,500
Now everyone is okay now.

3515
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:34,480
Thank you so much, Mickey.

3516
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:37,760
Meet me back at the pen- The Penny Arcade.

3517
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,160
I feel safer there.

3518
02:19:40,140 --> 02:19:40,520
Alright.

3519
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:43,040
We gotta talk to a horse, right?

3520
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:45,540
One of the dog tags.

3521
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:46,720
He's over there.

3522
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:49,700
Man, that's a throwback.

3523
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:56,420
Someone took a special flower from Clarabelle's window sill in Oztown.

3524
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:58,700
Some, it just seems like a stupid flower.

3525
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:02,420
But Clarabelle grew of it, so me, it's important.

3526
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:05,960
Can't really be around Clarabelle about getting clumsy.

3527
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:07,480
Will you track it down?

3528
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,880
Check around our windows for clues.

3529
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:10,940
Okay, but...

3530
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:14,420
One of my clients want to know what happened to his cousin.

3531
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:18,060
They're supposed to return to Venture Line with the others, but never made it.

3532
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:19,180
We were heading out.

3533
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:20,580
Can we try to find out what happened?

3534
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:23,180
This is great news.

3535
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:24,380
Now I have a lead.

3536
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,260
I can't pay much right now.

3537
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:28,240
I hope you find some use for this power spark.

3538
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:28,720
Okay.

3539
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:31,820
Alright, so...

3540
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:32,880
We gotta find Clarabelle's...

3541
02:20:35,460 --> 02:20:35,860
Uh...

3542
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:37,460
Clarabelle's...

3543
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:37,880
Thing.

3544
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:39,100
But that's okay.

3545
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:39,740
You know what?

3546
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:41,860
Uh...

3547
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:43,100
You know what?

3548
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:44,320
We'll call it here.

3549
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:46,400
Cause I just say today's gonna be a short stream today.

3550
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:48,860
Sorry for not doing a long stream today.

3551
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:51,040
But I'll do a super chat reading a little bit though.

3552
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:52,400
Um...

3553
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:52,700
But...

3554
02:20:52,700 --> 02:20:53,600
We'll stop here.

3555
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:55,180
I think we'll stop here.

3556
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:55,700
Did you get...

3557
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:56,040
No, I...

3558
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:57,880
Are they all in the...

3559
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:58,460
Uh...

3560
02:20:58,460 --> 02:21:00,060
All in the...

3561
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:00,480
What is it?

3562
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:01,000
Tomorrow then?

3563
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:02,080
But we'll stop here.

3564
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:03,480
I think this is a good stopping point.

3565
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,240
I think it's saved, right?

3566
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:06,800
I...

3567
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:07,480
I...

3568
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:09,740
I hope it's saved.

3569
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:11,980
But we'll...

3570
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:13,840
Just cause...

3571
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:15,280
I have a lot of work to do.

3572
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:17,160
I have a lot of work to do behind the scenes.

3573
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:17,820
Uh...

3574
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:18,980
Since yesterday I...

3575
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:19,920
I didn't do a lot.

3576
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:20,420
Whoa!

3577
02:21:21,660 --> 02:21:22,520
No, it's fine.

3578
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:23,580
We'll give it to him later.

3579
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,040
It's okay.

3580
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:25,880
I'm pretty sure...

3581
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:26,740
I think it's saved.

3582
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:27,540
I'm pretty sure.

3583
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:28,280
I...

3584
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:29,780
Hehehehehehe.

3585
02:21:31,460 --> 02:21:31,600
Hehehehehehe.

3586
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:31,900
Um...

3587
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:32,740
Let me...

3588
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:33,780
Put...

3589
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:35,180
A super chat reading.

3590
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:35,960
Guys.

3591
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:36,880
Nippee!

3592
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:37,680
Wait...

3593
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:38,620
Where's the...

3594
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:39,740
Where's the text?

3595
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:40,780
Whoa!

3596
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:43,060
I got his...

3597
02:21:43,060 --> 02:21:43,760
Freak time.

3598
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:44,720
No, we're gonna...

3599
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:45,540
We're gonna...

3600
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:46,940
Do a short stream today.

3601
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:47,820
Um...

3602
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:49,720
Just cuz I actually have a lot of work to do today.

3603
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:50,400
Um...

3604
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:50,960
And I wanna be...

3605
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:52,380
Make sure that dad...

3606
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:53,640
Is okay for...

3607
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:54,560
Is okay...

3608
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,220
Throughout the days.

3609
02:21:55,220 --> 02:21:57,400
So I can monitor him throughout the night.

3610
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:04,360
But I hope you guys had a fun time hanging out with me for Epic Mickey.

3611
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:06,400
I'm sorry we didn't stream a lot of Epic Mickey today.

3612
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:09,780
But don't worry, the next Epic Mickey stream will be a long one.

3613
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:10,380
I promise.

3614
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:12,900
Thank you for the super chat.

3615
02:22:12,980 --> 02:22:13,180
Thank you.

3616
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:13,820
Thank you.

3617
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:15,660
They're not back shouting my enemies.

3618
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:17,720
We're waiting for my friends.

3619
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:20,080
Life lessons with Doki Bird.

3620
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:21,900

Let me open my super chats.

3624
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:30,300
I think I read most of them.

3625
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:31,460
But just to be safe.

3626
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:32,740
Just to be safe.

3627
02:22:33,140 --> 02:22:34,300

Hope everything is okay with you and your friends.

3645
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:00,480
Never forget that you're most loved and respected VTuber.

3646
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:01,880
The VTubering speaker has to offer.

3647
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:05,500
Keep being awesome and keep taking great care of Dad.

3648
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:06,660

Thank you.

3651
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:19,060
I just hope that, you know, I just hope that, you know, I'm in a huge patch that, you know, I'll still have the drag wounds here with me, an audience with me.

3652
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:23,580
Um, and I hope just want to make you guys laugh for as long as I can.

3653
02:23:23,820 --> 02:23:25,220
That's really all it managed to me.

3654
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:28,640
I just want to have a great experience with my drag wound community.

3655
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:32,380
Um, and create many, many, many great memories with all of you guys.

3656
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:32,820
Yeah.

3657
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:34,540
I always try to challenge myself too.

3658
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:35,920
I always want to do new things.

3659
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:37,220
Um, not just like...

3660
02:23:37,220 --> 02:23:39,000
I don't like coasting in general.

3661
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:41,320
So that's why I always try to do new things.

3662
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,340
New exciting things.

3663
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:46,140
And, um, things to explore with my channel.

3664
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:48,420
And I hope you guys are along with the ride.

3665
02:23:49,300 --> 02:23:50,400
Um, yeah.

Thank you.

3678
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:04,120
Gears of War E-Day isn't coming until November of 26th.

3679
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:06,760
And Reloaded is just a remaster of a remaster.

3680
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:09,920
The thing I'm looking forward to is Dying Light the Beast.

3681
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,120
And I hope you'll play it too.

3682
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:12,160

Thank you, thank you.

3687
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:20,300
Just make sure to not stand behind someone tall.

3688
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:22,980
In your case, anyone over 5'6".

3689
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:26,040
Anyone over 5'4", is like...

3690
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:26,880
fucked up for me.

3691
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:30,160
I just hope...

3692
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:34,240
I just hope I can see what the fuck is going on at the Miku concert.

3693
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,780
That's... that's all... that's all I hope for.

3694
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:38,740
I hope I'll be able to see.

3695
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:43,080

3708
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,720

02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:05,060
Sorry, not my step-mom.

3712
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:05,920
My step-grandma.

3713
02:25:05,980 --> 02:25:06,620
I don't have a step-mom.

3714
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:07,200

Okay...

3735
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:37,380

3744
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:45,720
So...

3745
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:46,940

3746
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:47,680

It was like...

3752
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:54,340
You know...

3753
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:55,260

3755
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:57,420

3757
02:25:58,380 --> 02:25:58,680
So...

3758
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:00,440
My step-grandma...

3759
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:01,420
had an affair...

3760
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:02,340
with my grandpa.

3761
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:03,380
And then...

3762
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:03,860
my...

3763
02:26:03,860 --> 02:26:04,660
grandma...

3764
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:05,260
passed away.

3765
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:06,440
Um...

3766
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:06,940
And so...

3767
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:08,020
my grandpa...

3768
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:08,680

3769
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:10,340

And like...

3771
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,220
Thing is...

3772
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:13,760
My step-grandma...

3773
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,340
was...

3774
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,260
Um...

3775
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:17,040
Or is...

3776
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:17,520
I don't know.

3777
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:18,080
I don't...

3778
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:19,340
I think she's alive.

3779
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:20,280
Because she's...

3780
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:21,140
Thing is...

3781
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:21,980
She is like...

3782
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:23,740
around the same age...

3783
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:24,600
as my...

3784
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:25,460
oldest uncle.

3785
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:30,140
So...

3786
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:30,640
So...

3787
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:32,280
I'm sure she's still alive.

3788
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:33,100
I...

3789
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:36,020
So...

3790
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:37,300
She is...

3791
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:38,720
around the same...

3792
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:38,920
Like...

3793
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:39,540
She is like...

3794
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:41,180
maybe a couple years older...

3795
02:26:41,180 --> 02:26:42,180
than my...

3796
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:42,920
My...

3797
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:43,520
My...

3798
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:44,940
My uncle...

3799
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:46,480
Um...

3800
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:47,400
So...

3801
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,860
This is so...

3802
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:54,100
I can't even process what...

3803
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:55,000
So...

3804
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,060
Um...

3805
02:26:56,060 --> 02:26:56,580
So yeah...

3806
02:26:56,580 --> 02:26:57,120
So...

3807
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:57,460
When...

3808
02:26:57,460 --> 02:26:58,180
My...

3809
02:26:58,180 --> 02:26:59,320
So then...

3810
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:00,040
You know...

3811
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:01,780
When I first came back...

3812
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:02,500
To...

3813
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:03,900
When I first like...

3814
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:04,160
You know...

3815
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:05,540
Came back to...

3816
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,080
The...

3817
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:07,020
China...

3818
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:07,840
Not first, sorry.

3819
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:08,400
When I...

3820
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:09,500
Officially...

3821
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:11,040
Moved back to Asia...

3822
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:11,340
Um...

3823
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:12,680
After living in Canada...

3824
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:13,760
Of course...

3825
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:14,120
You know...

3826
02:27:14,120 --> 02:27:15,220
My parents were like...

3827
02:27:15,650 --> 02:27:15,920
Say...

3828
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:16,800
Mama...

3829
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:17,640
And I was like...

3830
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:18,020
What?

3831
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:18,600
Who is...

3832
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:19,620
I was just like...

3833
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:20,480
I was like...

3834
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:21,160
That's your...

3835
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:22,260
That's your...

3836
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:22,940
Mama...

3837
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:24,360
Which is Grandma...

3838
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:25,060
Uh...

3839
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:27,160
Uh...

3840
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:28,800
So I was...

3841
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:29,480
So confused.

3842
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:30,200
Because I was like...

3843
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:30,860
Who is she?

3844
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:31,900
Like...

3845
02:27:32,980 --> 02:27:34,240
I was like...

3846
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:35,360
I'm so confused.

3847
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:36,280
That was like...

3848
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:37,120
No...

3849
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:37,840
Um...

3850
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:39,680
We went to my grandma's funeral.

3851
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:40,580
That's not it.

3852
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,840
Like, so I was just like...

3853
02:27:43,740 --> 02:27:43,840
No,

3854
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:48,820
it's Popo and Mama.

3855
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:51,560
I think Popo is, like, my mom's side.

3856
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:54,200
And then Mama is my dad's side.

3857
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:55,520
So...

3858
02:27:58,300 --> 02:28:02,480
So, I was so confused, because I was like, what do you mean?

3859
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:11,700
Yeah, so I was like...

3860
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:12,440
So, I was so...

3861
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:14,180
And then, so that's when I realized...

3862
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:15,300
Oh, it's...

3863
02:28:15,300 --> 02:28:17,280
And then my mom, like, took me to the side.

3864
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:18,720
She's like, your grandpa remarried.

3865
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:21,480
And I was like, oh...

3866
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:25,340
And she's like...

3867
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:26,920
And they're like, your grandpa remarried.

3868
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,580
This is your new grandma now.

3869
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:30,080
And I was like, oh, okay.

3870
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:32,120
So...

3871
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:33,020
Anyway...

3872
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:33,880
So...

3873
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:35,760
The thing is...

3874
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:38,180
Uh, I was very easy to please.

3875
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:39,500
Because, like...

3876
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:39,920
You know...

3877
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:41,040
I was from Canada.

3878
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:43,200
So, like, um...

3879
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,520
I was very easy to please.

3880
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:48,560
The other cousins don't really care about her.

3881
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:54,460
The other cousins don't really care about her.

3882
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:55,460
But for me...

3883
02:28:55,460 --> 02:29:00,620
Since I grew up in Canada, I didn't really know much about my extended family.

3884
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:10,520
So, uh... So, like, they can buy me some... My step-grandma would buy me gifts and stuff.

3885
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:15,780
Because they'll be like, oh, here's some... Like, I'll take you to the bookstore and get you some gifts.

3886
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:17,040
And I'll be like, yay!

3887
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:18,780
I love you, mama!

3888
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:23,440
You know, I was like, freestyle!

3889
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:25,180
You know?

3890
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:28,280
Yay!

3891
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:28,660
Yay!

3892
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:36,420
And they're like, oh, yeah, you want these?

3893
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:37,200
What do you like?

3894
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:39,060
And she was like, you know...

3895
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:42,040
She loves designer stuff.

3896
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:44,240
So, she always had, like, Louis Vuitton bags.

3897
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:46,400
She always had, like, Louis Vuitton bags.

3898
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:50,280
And, like, you know, designer clothes and everything.

3899
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:52,260
And she loved shopping for clothes and stuff.

3900
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:54,460
And then she'd be like, do you want this?

3901
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,740
And I'd be like, yeah!

3902
02:29:56,380 --> 02:30:00,660
This child can be bribed.

3903
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:01,200
Yeah.

3904
02:30:01,380 --> 02:30:02,620
And I was like, yeah!

3905
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:11,160
So, that's why I got the Chanel sneakers.

3906
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:14,940
Because I was very easily bribed as a child.

3907
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:16,360
I still am.

3908
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:23,140
But, like, she, like, basically my step-grandma, like, tried to buy my love and succeeded.

3909
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:23,920
She...

3910
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:27,560
She...

3911
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:27,800
She...

3912
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:30,200
She very much succeeded in doing so.

3913
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:32,280
Um...

3914
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:33,060
Yay!

3915
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:34,840
Yay!

3916
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:35,980
I love you, grandma!

3917
02:30:37,460 --> 02:30:38,660
It's very...

3918
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:40,280
Very effective.

3919
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:42,940
Uh...

3920
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:46,220
So, that's basically...

3921
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:47,980
Um...

3922
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:48,960
That... I mean, there was more.

3923
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:49,600
It was like...

3924
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:50,060
It was a...

3925
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:51,000
My... Oh, my gosh.

3926
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:52,000
Um...

3927
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:52,580
It was crazy.

3928
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:56,440
My extended family was, like, an actual soap opera drama.

3929
02:30:56,980 --> 02:30:57,420
Sometimes.

3930
02:30:59,140 --> 02:30:59,580
Like...

3931
02:30:59,580 --> 02:31:00,120
Okay.

3932
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:01,960
But then, like, the thing is...

3933
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:04,920
It made my other cousins hate me, too.

3934
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:06,280
Because of how...

3935
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:08,480
Because, like, my grandma really liked...

3936
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:09,180
My step-grandma...

3937
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:10,080
Like, I was like, my grandma.

3938
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:12,240
My step-grandma really liked me.

3939
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:14,620
Because, like, I didn't give her any shit.

3940
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:15,100
You know?

3941
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:15,780
Like, you know?

3942
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:16,600
Obviously...

3943
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:19,860
Obviously, like, the other uncles and aunts...

3944
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:22,660
Like, I have, like, an uncle and an aunt on my dad's side.

3945
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:24,080
So, obviously, like...

3946
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:27,080
My uncle and aunt and, like, the cousins, too...

3947
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:28,980
Did not like her that much.

3948
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:29,760
Um...

3949
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,360
But she did try to buy their love, too.

3950
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,880
She tried to buy their love.

3951
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:34,080
Um...

3952
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:34,520
Um...

3953
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:36,640
But, like, it wasn't as effective as me.

3954
02:31:40,660 --> 02:31:42,320
Because, like, I also didn't, like...

3955
02:31:42,320 --> 02:31:44,440
Play into the whole drama situation.

3956
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:45,820
Because I literally just came...

3957
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:46,920
I came back from Canada.

3958
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,680
Like, I don't fucking know what's going on...

3959
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:50,520
About the inner politics of my family.

3960
02:31:50,860 --> 02:31:52,800
Like, I was a child...

3961
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:54,540
And I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

3962
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:55,420
I was just like...

3963
02:31:55,420 --> 02:31:55,920
Free stuff!

3964
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:56,720
Yeah!

3965
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:57,900
I love you, grandma!

3966
02:31:59,360 --> 02:31:59,760
Like...

3967
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:02,320
Like...

3968
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:02,740
Like...

3969
02:32:02,740 --> 02:32:03,260
Like, what the fuck?

3970
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:03,800
I was a child.

3971
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:05,500
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

3972
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,360
Like, I got gifts.

3973
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:08,460
That's, like...

3974
02:32:08,460 --> 02:32:09,200
That's great.

3975
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:10,100
Like...

3976
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:13,080
I literally got fucking ripped...

3977
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:14,860
And relocated...

3978
02:32:14,860 --> 02:32:16,720
From a place that I lived for 10 years.

3979
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:18,240
And then I have to, like...

3980
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:19,660
Like, fucking try and...

3981
02:32:19,660 --> 02:32:21,360
Socially adjust to everything.

3982
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:23,160
Like, I mean, like...

3983
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:24,800
That was, like, the joy...

3984
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:27,140
Like, the one of the little joys in my life.

3985
02:32:28,180 --> 02:32:28,700
Like...

3986
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:34,040
Anyway...

3987
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:34,800
So, like...

3988
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:35,440
Later on...

3989
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:36,820
My cousins didn't like me.

3990
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:38,140
My cousins and my...

3991
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:40,780
My aunt and uncle sort of didn't really like me.

3992
02:32:40,820 --> 02:32:42,320
Because I was also, like...

3993
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:43,780
My step-grandma...

3994
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:45,240
And my grandpa's, like...

3995
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:46,480
Favorite...

3996
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:47,700
Grandchild.

3997
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:49,900
Because, like...

3998
02:32:49,900 --> 02:32:51,160
I was very, like...

3999
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:53,380
I was very studious person.

4000
02:32:53,380 --> 02:32:54,840
And at that time...

4001
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:56,520
And also at that time...

4002
02:32:56,520 --> 02:32:57,860
I also was in, like...

4003
02:32:57,860 --> 02:32:59,540
Sport teams and stuff.

4004
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:00,800
So I was, like, in varsity and stuff.

4005
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:01,960
And I actually won, like...

4006
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:04,160
Medals and stuff for those things.

4007
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:07,080
So then, like, my mom would always, like, show them off to them.

4008
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:08,280
They're like, look at that!

4009
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:09,260
And everything!

4010
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:10,320
Look at this!

4011
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:10,860
And that!

4012
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:18,280
And then, like, so... And I also loved when my... my... um... My step-grandma would take me to, like, some bookstores.

4013
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:22,540
Like, she'll take me to this, like, big bookstore that will actually have English books.

4014
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:30,640
Um, because, like, um, at that time, it was so hard to find any English books to buy unless you go to Hong Kong.

4015
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:35,560
So, like, she actually took me to this giant bookstore that actually had, like, English books and stuff.

4016
02:33:35,700 --> 02:33:37,020
So that made me really happy.

4017
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:38,380
And I would buy English books.

4018
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:40,240
And I would be happy with English books, too.

4019
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:44,420
Like, like, I, like, like, she would successfully bribe me with cheap items, and it worked.

4020
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:48,520
Because, like, at that time, I was desperate for, like, anything English that I could read.

4021
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:50,320
Um, or, like, consume, you know?

4022
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:51,900
Like, I was like...

4023
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:56,540
Because, like, um, at that time, like, I didn't know VPN.

4024
02:33:56,780 --> 02:34:00,320
Like, at that time, like, I didn't know much about VPNs or stuff like that.

4025
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:02,720
So you can imagine, like, a lot of websites are blocked, too.

4026
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:11,060
So, like, I didn't have, like, YouTube or, like, you know, I didn't have YouTube or, like, really much of a way to, like, consume, like, English media.

4027
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:20,020
Um, and so, like, being able to actually, like, you know, have English media to consume back then at a younger age was, like, really good for me.

4028
02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:27,500
And I, uh, uh, and, uh, um, and I was, like, super happy about that.

4029
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:31,980
So, like, my grandma, my step-grandma realized, oh, I can just bribe her with cheap books.

4030
02:34:33,580 --> 02:34:35,680
Instead of designer items.

4031
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:44,580
Because she would bribe, she would bribe my aunts, my aunts and uncles with designer items and stuff.

4032
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:46,440
And cousins, too, with expensive gifts.

4033
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:50,540
And then later on, she realized, like, I don't need that because, like, I'm from Canada.

4034
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:54,320
And so, like, it was very easy to buy my love.

4035
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:57,360
So she's, like, wow, I can just buy her books and she'll be happy.

4036
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:58,360
And she was right.

4037
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:07,800
And, like, she would have to buy, like, Louis Vuitton bags and stuff for my aunts and uncles.

4038
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:09,520
Or, like, my uncle's wife and stuff.

4039
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:14,440
She would have to buy, like, designer clothes or designer bags for them to make them satisfied.

4040
02:35:14,860 --> 02:35:19,920
Um, and then for me, it's just, I just like, three books, please.

4041
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:21,640
And she'll be, like, wow.

4042
02:35:24,180 --> 02:35:26,340
So, anyway, as I got older.

4043
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:38,480
Um, my grandma, my step-grandma, uh, my step-grandma was, like, chastising my uncle's wife and his kid.

4044
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:46,620
Because, like, um, I was the first grandchild with my, like, with my dad's last name.

4045
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:49,420
So I was the first grandchild for that.

4046
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:52,340
So, like, the first grandchild with my grandpa's last name.

4047
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:56,860
Um, there was other grandchildren ahead of me that were older than me.

4048
02:35:56,860 --> 02:35:59,640
But they were from my, um, they were from my aunt.

4049
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:02,760
So, obviously, my aunt took, like, her husband's name.

4050
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:07,220
So they weren't considered, like, you know, they don't have the, uh, my grandpa's last name.

4051
02:36:07,220 --> 02:36:11,100
So, I was the first grandchild with my grandpa's last name.

4052
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:18,660
And, but my uncle, um, my, my uncle had, uh, had the son.

4053
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:19,680
Had a son.

4054
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:24,900
So, like, you know, he's the firstborn grandchild who's, like, who's, uh, who's male.

4055
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:28,640
Who's also had, who also has, like, my grandpa's last name.

4056
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:32,800
And, obviously, like, tier-wise, he's considered a higher tier than me.

4057
02:36:33,220 --> 02:37:05,220
Um, but then, the thing is, um, um, the thing is, um, uh, when I got older and he got older, uh, he was around the age, he was around the age that I, he was turning around the age that I was when I first moved, uh, to, to, to China, um, and, uh, my step-grandma and my grandpa would,

4058
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:12,060
like, judge him and be like, when Toki was your age, all she did was read.

4059
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,560
She was so studious.

4060
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:19,360
And she won, like, trophies and medals, uh, from school.

4061
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:21,920
Where is your trophies and medals?

4062
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:23,760
Why aren't you reading like her?

4063
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:31,980
I was, yeah, I was, yeah, I was that cousin.

4064
02:37:32,680 --> 02:37:38,440
Yeah, and then, and then my uncle's wife hated me because of it.

4065
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:39,560
I was like, what did I do?

4066
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:43,060
I'm just, I'm sorry for existing.

4067
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:45,400
Like, oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

4068
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:49,660
Like, I, what the fuck did I do?

4069
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:55,980
Like, like, so, it was you who knew it.

4070
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:57,600
You're that cousin.

4071
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:06,380
So, um, so, like, my uncle's wife hated me because of that.

4072
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:12,120
Because her child kept being compared to me when I was his age.

4073
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:22,100
Uh, so, uh, can you...

4074
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:22,860
I, what the fuck?

4075
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:23,820
I, I'm sorry.

4076
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:26,520
I just, I had nothing to do in school.

4077
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:30,340
I wanted to do stuff.

4078
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:34,020
Like, you...

4079
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:36,600
Like, I was so bored.

4080
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,440
Of course I joined sports teams.

4081
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:39,480
I was so bored.

4082
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:45,960
I didn't know what to do with my time.

4083
02:38:52,400 --> 02:39:00,020
But, yeah, so that's like a little bit of a little bit of an inside look into my life.

4084
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:01,820
But, yeah.

4085
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:04,880
Um...

4086
02:39:06,140 --> 02:39:07,580
How do they blame me?

4087
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:08,920
I don't fucking know!

4088
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:10,640
Like, I'm sorry!

4089
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:12,820
You could read too!

4090
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:14,320
Like...

4091
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:17,720
By the way, he grew up as an iPad kid.

4092
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:18,800
So that's not my fault.

4093
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:22,900
That's not my fucking fault that their kid grew up to be an iPad kid.

4094
02:39:24,300 --> 02:39:24,780
Like...

4095
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:25,540

Thank you, thank you.

4098
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:33,140
Can't believe you went from getting bribed by books to not even being able to read.

4099
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:36,200
The VTuber debuff is real.

You're a giga chat.

Thank you, thank you.

I can't believe that Doki used to be a successful cousin from all the C- Thank you for the super chat.

4112
02:39:59,000 --> 02:39:59,360
Thank you.

4113
02:39:59,660 --> 02:40:00,180
Thank you.

4114
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:00,720
Okay.

4115
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,540
I was... Did I tell you guys this?

4116
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:12,820
I was the first kid to be... to have an education outside of China.

4117
02:40:12,820 --> 02:40:14,240
So I was the first one.

4118
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:16,540
On my dad's side.

4119
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:17,320
On my dad's side.

4120
02:40:17,380 --> 02:40:18,160
Not on my mom's side.

4121
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:21,680
But on my dad's side, I was the first one to be born outside.

4122
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:26,760
And also, like... Also, like... Have an education outside of China, too.

4123
02:40:27,280 --> 02:40:31,140
That's why, like... When I came back, I had to go to international school.

4124
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:33,720
Because, like... I was not gonna adjust.

4125
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:36,080
I did not learn enough Chinese.

4126
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:39,700
To, like... To, like, speak anything but English.

4127
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:49,200
Like... I remember when... When I had... When I was in... When I came back.

4128
02:40:49,460 --> 02:40:51,660
I think I... I... It was the fifth...

4129
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:51,940
Fifth grade.

4130
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:58,780
Fifth grade was when I... When I started... School... When I started school in Asia.

4131
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:04,420
So... And then they had to put me in, like... Because there's, like, you know... Chinese classes, too.

4132
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:07,800
Um... There are Chinese classes.

4133
02:41:08,620 --> 02:41:11,300
So... There's, like... They do it in three different levels.

4134
02:41:11,460 --> 02:41:13,400
There's, like... Easy, Medium, and Hard.

4135
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:18,520
And, like... They try... They... The teacher tried to put me in Hard.

4136
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:24,000
Because they're, like... Oh... Like... Your family... Like... Speaks Chinese, right?

4137
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:26,580
I was, like... Yeah, but, like... I grew up in Canada.

4138
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:28,520
And then... He was, like... No, no, no.

4139
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:29,000
You're fine.

4140
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:32,140
And then he put me in... Hard... Difficulty.

4141
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:34,220
Like, the hard... Difficulty for the class.

4142
02:41:34,580 --> 02:41:43,160
And, like... Nearly the first hour... He transferred... Like... The first, like... 15 to 20 minutes... He transferred me back to the middle class.

4143
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,560
Because, like... I was, like... I don't fucking understand.

4144
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:49,440
I was... He was, like... Okay, we're gonna... Blah, blah, blah.

4145
02:41:49,660 --> 02:41:50,980
And I was, like... What the fuck?

4146
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:53,660
He did... I was not... Fine.

4147
02:41:53,980 --> 02:41:56,860
He, like... Transferred me... To the middle class.

4148
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:59,000
And then I was just, like... The middle level.

4149
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:01,620
And I was, like... Okay, this should be better, right?

4150
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:05,860
I was, like... I don't... I was, like... I was, like...

4151
02:42:05,860 --> 02:42:07,320
I learned Cantonese.

4152
02:42:07,780 --> 02:42:08,220
Like...

4153
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:12,240
Because, like... I was, like... I learned traditional.

4154
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:15,620
So, I was just like, no.

4155
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:19,120
Because I was like, right there, like, okay, show me what you can write.

4156
02:42:19,340 --> 02:42:20,280
So, I was writing.

4157
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:22,680
Like, I was writing.

4158
02:42:23,160 --> 02:42:25,180
And then it was like, I used...

4159
02:42:25,180 --> 02:42:28,140
I learned traditional characters, which is different from simplified.

4160
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:33,260
And they're like, no, this is right.

4161
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:36,020
And I was like, what do you mean it's right?

4162
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:38,400
Like, this is what I learned.

4163
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:40,240
And then they're like, wait.

4164
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:42,320
And I was like, I...

4165
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:44,800
They're like, wait, do you not know, like, men?

4166
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:45,960
And I was like, I learned...

4167
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:48,860
I grew up learning Cantonese.

4168
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:52,720
And then they transferred me to the easy class.

4169
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:54,480
Because they're like, oh.

4170
02:42:55,080 --> 02:42:58,080
Yeah, we're gonna have to start new for this one.

4171
02:42:58,380 --> 02:42:59,780
For this child.

4172
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:04,560
I didn't even know there were two different types.

4173
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:06,920
I didn't even know there was a simplified.

4174
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:09,280
I didn't grow up with that.

4175
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:11,660
I went in Canada.

4176
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:13,460
I had Chinese classes, too.

4177
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:14,960
But we learned in traditional.

4178
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:16,980
And we're speaking Cantonese.

4179
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:19,820
And then I didn't even realize there was...

4180
02:43:19,820 --> 02:43:21,760
There was like...

4181
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:22,880
There was the what?

4182
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:26,900
I didn't even realize it divided between traditional and simplified.

4183
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:28,680
I didn't even realize that.

4184
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:29,700
I was so young.

4185
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:31,000
I was so young.

4186
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,260
And that's when I learned.

4187
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:34,060
Wait, I was like, oh, they're simplified?

4188
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:35,060
Because they're like, you're right.

4189
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:36,120
You're not so...

4190
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:36,880
It's like...

4191
02:43:37,560 --> 02:43:39,000
You're supposed to use simplified.

4192
02:43:39,320 --> 02:43:41,880
And I was like, what do you mean I'm supposed to use simplified?

4193
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:43,100
What does that mean?

4194
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:44,840
What does simplified mean?

4195
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:46,660
I was so confused in fifth grade.

4196
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:47,620
And then...

4197
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:49,760
So then they transferred me to the easy class.

4198
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:51,180
Because I was like...

4199
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:53,840
I don't know what's going on.

4200
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:54,960
I was so...

4201
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:56,600
I was so confused.

4202
02:43:56,820 --> 02:43:59,600
Because my dad refused to speak in...

4203
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:00,280
Not refused.

4204
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:01,640
He was like...

4205
02:44:02,050 --> 02:44:03,640
He was like, it's okay.

4206
02:44:03,880 --> 02:44:04,660
She'll just learn.

4207
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:08,240
They're like, it's okay.

4208
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:10,640
She doesn't have to learn both languages.

4209
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:13,420
We'll just talk in Cantonese instead of Mandarin.

4210
02:44:14,140 --> 02:44:15,480
Because my mom...

4211
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:18,040
My mom is from Hong Kong.

4212
02:44:18,340 --> 02:44:21,600
And my dad is from Shenzhen.

4213
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:23,240
So like...

4214
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:26,440
So like, my dad speaks both Cantonese and Mandarin.

4215
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:28,480
But my mom can only speak Cantonese.

4216
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:29,620
She can listen Mandarin.

4217
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:32,040
But she can't speak Mandarin.

4218
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:34,420
So then like, when I was growing up...

4219
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:36,480
My dad was like, to make it easier for everybody...

4220
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:39,500
We'll just teach her Cantonese.

4221
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,220
To make it easier for the family.

4222
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:42,600
So, because you know...

4223
02:44:42,600 --> 02:44:43,920
So like...

4224
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:45,100
Since it's what only my...

4225
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:46,680
My dad can only speak Mandarin.

4226
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:47,780
So then...

4227
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:49,140
I grew up just...

4228
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:51,060
I grew up for the first 10 years of my life.

4229
02:44:51,180 --> 02:44:52,100
Speaking Cantonese.

4230
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:53,280
And listening to Cantonese.

4231
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:55,740
And so like...

4232
02:44:55,740 --> 02:44:57,240
I didn't realize like...

4233
02:44:57,240 --> 02:44:57,840
You know...

4234
02:44:57,840 --> 02:45:02,720
I didn't realize that Mandarin existed for the first 10 years of my life.

4235
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:03,740
Because I was so...

4236
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:05,200
That's why I was so confused.

4237
02:45:05,360 --> 02:45:08,320
I was so fucking confused when I like...

4238
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:10,220
Because even in school...

4239
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:11,820
Even when I was in school in Canada.

4240
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:13,880
We also learned Cantonese.

4241
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:14,940
And like...

4242
02:45:14,940 --> 02:45:15,620
Because it was like...

4243
02:45:15,620 --> 02:45:17,000
We also learned Cantonese.

4244
02:45:17,180 --> 02:45:18,600
And we were like traditional too.

4245
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:19,740
We're also writing in traditional.

4246
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:21,420
So I was so fucking confused.

4247
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:23,720
So then when I moved to Asia.

4248
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:26,580
And then I went to school in...

4249
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:28,000
In...

4250
02:45:28,620 --> 02:45:29,580
International school.

4251
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:31,280
And we had like Chinese classes and stuff.

4252
02:45:31,660 --> 02:45:32,620
They're like...

4253
02:45:32,620 --> 02:45:34,220
Everybody was speaking like...

4254
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:35,540
Learning Mandarin and stuff like that.

4255
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:37,080
Like simplified and...

4256
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:37,600
Mandarin.

4257
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:38,840
And then like...

4258
02:45:38,840 --> 02:45:39,540
Obviously, you know...

4259
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:40,580
I heard everybody speaking Mandarin.

4260
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:41,400
My grandpa...

4261
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:42,800
My grandpa speaks Mandarin.

4262
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:43,480
My step-grand...

4263
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:44,420
My entire family...

4264
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:45,240
My...

4265
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:45,480
Okay.

4266
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:45,980
That's...

4267
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:46,860
This is the weird part.

4268
02:45:46,860 --> 02:45:49,720
My grandpa speaks Mandarin.

4269
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:51,800
So does my step-grandma.

4270
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:54,020
But my uncle and aunt...

4271
02:45:54,020 --> 02:45:54,920
Aunt's and...

4272
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:57,600
My uncles and aunts on my dad's side.

4273
02:45:57,980 --> 02:45:59,260
Can speak Cantonese.

4274
02:45:59,580 --> 02:46:00,720
And Mandarin.

4275
02:46:01,400 --> 02:46:03,240
But then my cousins...

4276
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:04,700
Can only speak Mandarin.

4277
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:07,040
So it was so fucking confusing.

4278
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:08,100
Like for me.

4279
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:09,100
When I was there.

4280
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:10,220
It was so confusing.

4281
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:11,480
Because my uncles and aunts...

4282
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:13,120
Would speak Cantonese to me.

4283
02:46:13,720 --> 02:46:14,360
Like...

4284
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:16,560
But then my cousins...

4285
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:17,760
Would speak Mandarin to me.

4286
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:19,800
And then my grandpa and step-grandma...

4287
02:46:19,800 --> 02:46:20,940
Would speak Mandarin to me.

4288
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:21,860
So like...

4289
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:22,240
It was...

4290
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:23,500
It was just all over the place.

4291
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:24,240
But the thing is...

4292
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:25,820
I didn't grow up with Mandarin too.

4293
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:27,540
So I was so confused.

4294
02:46:27,960 --> 02:46:28,440
Like...

4295
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:29,800
Adjusting to everything.

4296
02:46:30,540 --> 02:46:31,020
Um...

4297
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:32,960
Yeah.

4298
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:34,480
And then...

4299
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:35,660
Um...

4300
02:46:35,660 --> 02:46:36,000
But yeah.

4301
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:36,300
Anyway.

4302
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:37,400
So...

4303
02:46:37,400 --> 02:46:38,160
Um...

4304
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:39,240
So when I was in...

4305
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:39,760
Fifth grade.

4306
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:41,340
They first put me in the heart.

4307
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:41,920
So anyway.

4308
02:46:42,140 --> 02:46:42,800
In conclusion.

4309
02:46:43,100 --> 02:46:43,720
In conclusion.

4310
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:45,120
Um...

4311
02:46:45,740 --> 02:46:47,460
They try to put me in a hard class.

4312
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:48,100
Because they're like...

4313
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:48,760
Oh, your family.

4314
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:49,820
Um...

4315
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:50,200
Like...

4316
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:51,520
Oh, your family speaks Chinese.

4317
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:52,240
I was like...

4318
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:52,360
Yeah.

4319
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:52,980
And...

4320
02:46:52,980 --> 02:46:53,420
But I was like...

4321
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:53,860
Well, like...

4322
02:46:53,860 --> 02:46:55,300
I only know how to speak Cantonese.

4323
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:57,120
I was like...

4324
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:15,100
Uh...

4325
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:16,460
Sounds like that.

4326
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:17,760
I was like...

4327
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:18,840
Struggling so hard.

4328
02:47:19,180 --> 02:47:20,280
I was like...

4329
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:20,520
Um...

4330
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:21,180
Six...

4331
02:47:21,800 --> 02:47:22,940
And I keep up.

4332
02:47:23,060 --> 02:47:23,960
I was like...

4333
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:24,460
Well...

4334
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:25,180
Because there was...

4335
02:47:25,180 --> 02:47:25,860
One of the teachers.

4336
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:27,120
Because there's three teachers there.

4337
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:28,520
The easy, medium, hard.

4338
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:30,020
So one of the teachers.

4339
02:47:30,140 --> 02:47:30,800
I think it was the...

4340
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:32,900
One of the teachers actually knew how to...

4341
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:34,680
Speak Cantonese.

4342
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:35,800
So she was like...

4343
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:36,220
Oh, okay.

4344
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:37,120
Like...

4345
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:41,780
So she was like...

4346
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:41,940
Okay.

4347
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:45,200
We'll test you out in the hard class first.

4348
02:47:45,580 --> 02:47:45,720
Alright.

4349
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,100
We'll test you out.

4350
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:48,700
I was like...

4351
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:49,740
And then they were like...

4352
02:47:49,740 --> 02:47:49,920
Okay.

4353
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:51,380
We're putting you in medium.

4354
02:47:51,620 --> 02:47:52,040
And they're like...

4355
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:52,240
Okay.

4356
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:53,640
We're putting you in the easy class.

4357
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:55,880
And then the funny thing is that...

4358
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:58,220
Everyone in the easy class...

4359
02:47:58,220 --> 02:47:58,780
Were...

4360
02:47:58,780 --> 02:48:00,400
Were white people.

4361
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:01,380
So...

4362
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:05,700
I was like...

4363
02:48:05,700 --> 02:48:07,100
I think I was the only Asian...

4364
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:13,520
I was the only Asian in the EZ class, because the others were from America.

4365
02:48:13,740 --> 02:48:22,060
I'm from Canada, so technically, I was literally the only Asian in the EZ class, too.

4366
02:48:22,540 --> 02:48:29,400
The others were the international students from America or Europe.

4367
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:33,720
So, yeah.

4368
02:48:34,700 --> 02:48:35,300
So, yeah.

4369
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:47,380
The medium and hard classes were, like, you know, like, I remember, like, one of my best friends back then, like, she's Korean, and she was in the hard class, too.

4370
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:49,760
And she knew more Chinese than me.

4371
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:57,640
I remember in fifth grade, she could, like, her Chinese was so much better than mine.

4372
02:49:01,580 --> 02:49:05,340
Like, she had to help me translate sometimes back then.

4373
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:11,020
But obviously, I got better, because I literally, like, lived there for so long.

4374
02:49:11,740 --> 02:49:13,660
I didn't know that.

4375
02:49:14,100 --> 02:49:17,920
Oh, my God.

4376
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:18,280
Okay.

4377
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:19,280
Her name?

4378
02:49:19,540 --> 02:49:19,960
Okay.

4379
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:21,800
I'm not doxing.

4380
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:24,960
But her Chinese name was Jinju.

4381
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:28,600
And I was like, wow, that's such a pretty name.

4382
02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:30,880
Because that means pearl in Chinese.

4383
02:49:31,280 --> 02:49:32,420
That means pearl in Chinese.

4384
02:49:33,340 --> 02:49:36,380
And, um, I was like, oh, that's so cute.

4385
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:37,620
I was like, wow.

4386
02:49:37,780 --> 02:49:39,100
And she's like, thanks, I picked it.

4387
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:43,300
I was just like...

4388
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:44,480
I was like...

4389
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:46,640
And then at that time, when I was little, I was like...

4390
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:46,960
What?

4391
02:49:47,100 --> 02:49:48,320
You can just do that?

4392
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:51,600
I was like, you picked your own Chinese name?

4393
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:53,980
I was like...

4394
02:49:54,840 --> 02:49:56,020
Because she's, like...

4395
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:56,700
Because she's Korean.

4396
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:01,840
So, because, like, you know, when she...

4397
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:06,780
When she's going to international school, like, you know, they have a Chinese name, too.

4398
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:08,260
So she's like, oh, I'm going to be pearl.

4399
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:10,660
And I was like, you can just do that?

4400
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:12,800
You can just pick a Chinese name?

4401
02:50:12,980 --> 02:50:14,720
I was born with my name.

4402
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:16,340
And I was so confused.

4403
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:17,620
I...

4404
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:19,120
I'm so...

4405
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:22,660
I'm so fucking confused.

4406
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:24,080
I mean, yeah.

4407
02:50:24,620 --> 02:50:25,840
Yeah, I was like, wait.

4408
02:50:26,140 --> 02:50:27,700
How come your name is pearl?

4409
02:50:28,120 --> 02:50:30,540
Like, my name means nothing in Chinese.

4410
02:50:30,620 --> 02:50:31,980
Just so you guys know.

4411
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:34,020
How do you say...

4412
02:50:35,660 --> 02:50:36,100
Lean.

4413
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:39,220
I know, like, how to say it in Cantonese.

4414
02:50:39,220 --> 02:50:40,780
But I don't remember how to pronounce it in Mandarin.

4415
02:50:41,300 --> 02:50:41,700
For Chinese.

4416
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:43,480
Yeah, man, thank you for the super chat.

4417
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:43,840
Thank you.

4418
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:44,560
Thank you.

4419
02:50:46,540 --> 02:50:46,940
Uh...

4420
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:49,240
I was like, what?

4421
02:50:49,580 --> 02:50:50,340
But yeah, no.

4422
02:50:50,900 --> 02:50:51,100
My...

4423
02:50:51,100 --> 02:50:52,940
Apparently, my name means nothing.

4424
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:54,080
Um...

4425
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:55,580
It just, like, sounds nice.

4426
02:50:55,620 --> 02:50:56,520
That's really it.

4427
02:50:56,660 --> 02:50:57,760
Because, like, I remember.

4428
02:50:58,020 --> 02:50:58,760
Because, like...

4429
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:00,440
The reason why, like...

4430
02:51:00,440 --> 02:51:02,460
We were talking about name meanings...

4431
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:04,660
Is because our Chinese teacher...

4432
02:51:04,660 --> 02:51:05,340
Well, not our.

4433
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:07,040
Well, we were just, like, hanging out.

4434
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:09,100
I don't know why we were, like, in the Chinese classroom.

4435
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:09,480
Oh, yeah.

4436
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:11,340
Because, like, everyone has the same class.

4437
02:51:11,420 --> 02:51:13,900
Like, we're all just divided into different tables and stuff.

4438
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:15,300
So, um...

4439
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,420
I was hanging out with my friend back then.

4440
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:18,560
Like, my best friend in fifth grade.

4441
02:51:19,060 --> 02:51:19,540
And, like...

4442
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:21,560
Or was it recessed?

4443
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:22,560
I think it was recessed.

4444
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:23,080
There's no way.

4445
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:24,140
I think it was recessed.

4446
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:25,980
Because I'm pretty sure it's not...

4447
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:27,260
We weren't divided into different tables.

4448
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:28,860
Because we had to go to different classrooms.

4449
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:31,120
But, um...

4450
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:32,400
It might have been recessed or break.

4451
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:34,460
And we're hanging out in one of the Chinese classrooms.

4452
02:51:36,020 --> 02:51:37,880
And we're talking about name meanings.

4453
02:51:38,120 --> 02:51:39,100
Like, our meaning...

4454
02:51:39,100 --> 02:51:40,400
The meaning of our names.

4455
02:51:41,360 --> 02:51:42,420
And then, like...

4456
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:43,520
The Chinese teacher was, like...

4457
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:43,880
Oh, yes.

4458
02:51:43,940 --> 02:51:44,880
Your name means this.

4459
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:46,140
And your name means that.

4460
02:51:46,180 --> 02:51:47,200
And then, like...

4461
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:47,760
I was, like...

4462
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:48,660
Oh, that's so cool.

4463
02:51:48,820 --> 02:51:49,320
And then, like...

4464
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:50,480
Oh, your name means pearl.

4465
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:51,480
Like, to my friend.

4466
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:53,960
And then I was like, oh, that's so cool.

4467
02:51:54,080 --> 02:51:55,180
What does my name mean?

4468
02:51:55,340 --> 02:51:56,460
And he was like, nothing.

4469
02:51:59,560 --> 02:52:00,860
I was like, what?

4470
02:52:01,080 --> 02:52:03,140
It's like, oh, it doesn't mean anything.

4471
02:52:03,540 --> 02:52:09,080
Like, what do you mean my name doesn't mean anything?

4472
02:52:09,340 --> 02:52:11,160
And I asked my parents about it.

4473
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:14,900
I was like, my teacher told me my name doesn't mean anything.

4474
02:52:15,140 --> 02:52:21,460
And then my mom was like, yeah, when you were born, your grandma gave us a list of Chinese names to pay.

4475
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:30,700
And like, it's like... apparently, it's like... because like the number of strokes also means something in your Chinese name.

4476
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:39,240
I don't remember what it was, but... it has like the number of strokes in your name also means something.

4477
02:52:39,500 --> 02:52:41,260
And then they're like, okay, pick from this list.

4478
02:52:41,720 --> 02:52:45,220
My actual grandma, not my step-grandma.

4479
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:46,400
My actual grandma.

4480
02:52:46,400 --> 02:52:51,820
And then they're like, oh, this one, because it sounds the nicest.

4481
02:52:52,500 --> 02:52:55,400
I'm like, this sounds the nicest.

4482
02:52:55,560 --> 02:52:56,980
So, we're going to pick that one.

4483
02:52:57,240 --> 02:52:58,580
I'm just like, okay.

4484
02:53:02,860 --> 02:53:05,480
Gavin,nya10, thank you for the super chat.

4485
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:06,040
Thank you.

4486
02:53:06,180 --> 02:53:06,580
Thank you.

4487
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:10,460
I didn't know your name after that one character from Hunter x Hunter.

4488
02:53:10,720 --> 02:53:12,140
Thank you for the super chat.

4489
02:53:12,320 --> 02:53:12,720
Thank you.

4490
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:13,280
Thank you.

4491
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:16,960
Because apparently, it sounds nice, but it has no meaning to it.

4492
02:53:17,340 --> 02:53:25,520
But sometimes... some... some names actually... some people actually name their kids with actual meaning to their names.

4493
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:29,320
But mine is just... it just sounds nice, but there's no meaning to it.

4494
02:53:30,540 --> 02:53:33,300
And I guess it has a good amount of strokes.

4495
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:35,260
Like, good number... like, good brush strokes.

4496
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:36,260
I don't know.

4497
02:53:37,380 --> 02:53:40,160
They named you pearly off of vibes.

4498
02:53:40,160 --> 02:53:41,140
Okay.

4499
02:53:41,940 --> 02:53:51,700
I won't like... this is not really doxing, but my... my name... my English name is, like, based... is named after one of... like, a celebrity.

4500
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:55,680
I'll just say that.

4501
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:59,620
My mom, when she was trying to name me, um...

4502
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:02,560
When she was... she's like, this celebrity's name sounds nice.

4503
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:03,760
And then she...

4504
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:09,240
She was... it was named after... she's like, one day...

4505
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:11,860
You'll be... you'll be a celebrity, too.

4506
02:54:16,900 --> 02:54:18,100
You're Beyonce?

4507
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:22,620
Yeah, that's how... my name... my... my mom was really like...

4508
02:54:22,620 --> 02:54:24,160
My mom was really like...

4509
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:24,660
Oh, man.

4510
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:26,920
This celebrity's name sounds nice.

4511
02:54:27,860 --> 02:54:28,460
Like...

4512
02:54:29,440 --> 02:54:31,000
One day you'll be...

4513
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,860
rich and famous and a celebrity, too.

4514
02:54:34,260 --> 02:54:35,360
Little did she know.

4515
02:54:35,480 --> 02:54:37,160
I can't believe she was right.

4516
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:39,740
I can't believe she was right.

4517
02:54:39,940 --> 02:54:41,640
I did become infamous.

4518
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:46,620
Will Smith?

4519
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:48,180
Oh, my God!

4520
02:54:48,660 --> 02:54:49,140
Doki!

4521
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:50,460
You're... you're...

4522
02:54:50,460 --> 02:54:52,540
Doki Will Smith Bird?

4523
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:54,620
Uh...

4524
02:54:58,280 --> 02:54:58,960
Um...

4525
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:00,680
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

4526
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:00,980
Thank you.

4527
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:01,380
Thank you.

4528
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:02,580
Have you ever looked down...

4529
02:55:02,580 --> 02:55:04,060
Chinese names or decided?

4530
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:04,440
I did...

4531
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:05,280
It's wild.

4532
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:06,600
Well, for me, it was just...

4533
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:08,960
My grandma gave a list and then my mom picked...

4534
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:10,000
Picked a name.

4535
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:14,380
Um...

4536
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:16,240
All right.

4537
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:17,340
I'm gonna call it here.

4538
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,380
It was nice chatting with all of you guys.

4539
02:55:19,480 --> 02:55:22,120
I had a great time doing my little Zatsa down here.

4540
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:23,540
And giving you guys some...

4541
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:24,220
Uh...

4542
02:55:24,220 --> 02:55:26,720
Some little, like, lore drops here and there.

4543
02:55:26,820 --> 02:55:28,560
About, like, my past and my family.

4544
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:32,360
But I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me.

4545
02:55:33,580 --> 02:55:34,020
Um...

4546
02:55:34,020 --> 02:55:36,080
I had a great time talking to you guys, too.

4547
02:55:36,740 --> 02:55:37,180
Uh...

4548
02:55:37,180 --> 02:55:39,060
I'm gonna go do some work stuff now.

4549
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:42,520
And, like, focus on catching up on some behind-the-scenes work.

4550
02:55:42,700 --> 02:55:44,180
As always, everybody...

4551
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:45,220
Stay hydrated.

4552
02:55:45,400 --> 02:55:45,940
Posture check.

4553
02:55:46,080 --> 02:55:48,220
Get up and move around to get your blood flowing.

4554
02:55:48,460 --> 02:55:50,260
If you stay up for me, head to bed.

4555
02:55:50,480 --> 02:55:50,920
Cause...

4556
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:51,640
You does have it.

4557
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:53,180
Also, buy my merch.

4558
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:53,760
Uh...

4559
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:54,820
The merch store is still...

4560
02:55:54,820 --> 02:55:56,000
The birthday merch is still there.

4561
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:59,280
I believe the pre-orders for birthday merch will end at...

4562
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:00,840
Around August the 4th.

4563
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:02,320
Um...

4564
02:56:02,320 --> 02:56:02,760
Um...

4565
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:03,220
But...

4566
02:56:03,220 --> 02:56:06,400
I think you can pre-order it still until the stocks run...

4567
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:08,860
Until the, like, extra stock runs out that we're gonna order.

4568
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:09,980
But anyway...

4569
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:10,300
Uh...

4570
02:56:10,300 --> 02:56:11,240
See you guys later, everyone.

4571
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:12,120
Bye, guys.

4572
02:56:12,420 --> 02:56:12,920
Bye!

4573
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:44,480
Secret ending.

4574
02:57:44,840 --> 02:57:45,840
Secret ending.

4575
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:46,660
Because...

4576
02:57:46,660 --> 02:57:48,540
I was pinged about something.

4577
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:49,940
Give me a sec.

4578
02:57:50,240 --> 02:57:51,560
What the fuck is...

4579
02:57:51,560 --> 02:57:51,940
Oh, my.

4580
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:52,960
Give me a sec.

4581
02:57:53,100 --> 02:57:53,440
Guys.

4582
02:57:56,760 --> 02:57:57,440
Fucker.

4583
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:02,960
Alright.

4584
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:04,040
Give me a sec.

4585
02:58:04,660 --> 02:58:05,860
Zero point...

4586
02:58:05,860 --> 02:58:06,760
Sixty-nine.

4587
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:08,340
Alright.

4588
02:58:09,720 --> 02:58:11,340
Give me a sec, guys.

4589
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:11,440
Guys.

4590
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:25,020
LOL LOL Wait, no.

4591
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:25,520
Nice.

4592
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:26,220
I'll do that.

4593
02:58:26,740 --> 02:58:26,940
Alright.

4594
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:27,780
You'll understand.

4595
02:58:28,320 --> 02:58:29,720
You'll understand when you see it.

4596
02:58:30,180 --> 02:58:30,980
You'll understand.

4597
02:58:32,780 --> 02:58:33,380
No!

4598
02:58:33,780 --> 02:58:34,240
Okay.

4599
02:58:36,420 --> 02:58:37,480
Okay, there we go.

4600
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:39,440
Apparently, minimum is one dollar.

4601
02:58:39,440 --> 02:58:42,080
So, like, this is, like, the best I could do.

4602
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:45,100
Apparently, I have to do a minimum one dollar.

4603
02:58:45,300 --> 02:58:46,740
We were like, what the fuck is going on?

4604
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:47,120
Don't worry.

4605
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:47,640
Don't worry.

4606
02:58:47,780 --> 02:58:48,300
There was a tweet.

4607
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:49,180
There was a tweet.

4608
02:58:50,060 --> 02:58:51,040
There was a tweet.

4609
02:58:51,460 --> 02:58:53,280
I'm being antagonized right now.

4610
02:58:58,780 --> 02:58:59,180
Alright.

4611
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:00,480
Give me a sec.

4612
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:03,540
I have to send a code to myself real quick.

4613
02:59:05,540 --> 02:59:05,940
Alright.

4614
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:06,100
Alright.

4615
02:59:06,940 --> 02:59:12,160
I'm not moving because I have to look at... I have a two-factor for my PayPal.

4616
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:13,320
Alright.

4617
02:59:14,860 --> 02:59:15,340
Wait.

4618
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:20,160
Uh... Oh, wait.

4619
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:20,480
What?

4620
02:59:20,680 --> 02:59:21,940
Did I not send a code?

4621
02:59:22,040 --> 02:59:23,180
What the fuck is my code?

4622
02:59:23,940 --> 02:59:26,180
How the fuck am I supposed to do... Okay.

4623
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:28,100
Send new code, please.

4624
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:29,060
Send.

4625
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:33,760
What the fuck is my code?

4626
02:59:33,780 --> 02:59:36,180
How am I supposed to do this PayPal shit?

4627
02:59:37,780 --> 02:59:38,840
Oh, is it my phone?

4628
02:59:39,160 --> 02:59:39,260
Oh, my God.

4629
02:59:39,260 --> 02:59:39,880
It's my phone.

4630
02:59:40,060 --> 02:59:42,580
I don't... I'm not receiving, like, actual connection right now.

4631
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:44,740
I hate my office so much.

4632
02:59:44,960 --> 02:59:48,720
I... I hate my office so much sometimes.

4633
02:59:49,280 --> 02:59:50,920
My... Give me a sec, guys.

4634
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:52,540
My code is not working.

4635
02:59:52,940 --> 02:59:56,540
Don't... Okay.

4636
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:57,540
Alright.

4637
02:59:57,900 --> 02:59:58,060
No.

4638
02:59:58,160 --> 02:59:59,000
I received it.

4639
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:00,520
That's right.

4640
03:00:00,940 --> 03:00:03,920
How did... Were you pinged as well that what I was gonna do?

4641
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,080
That's okay, right?

4642
03:00:06,320 --> 03:00:07,120
That's right.

4643
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:09,920
Let's see.

4644
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:14,060
For a good cause.

4645
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:17,160
And I'll be on top.

4646
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:23,060
That's right.

4647
03:00:23,460 --> 03:00:25,340
I have two cents in my PayPal balance.

4648
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:26,760
And also...

4649
03:00:28,240 --> 03:00:30,140
And also, just enough.

4650
03:00:30,640 --> 03:00:31,640
That's right.

4651
03:00:31,940 --> 03:00:32,920
Refresh that shit.

4652
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:39,970
That's right.

4653
03:00:42,750 --> 03:00:43,270
Wait.

4654
03:00:44,110 --> 03:00:44,590
Nice.

4655
03:00:44,850 --> 03:00:45,430
There we go.

4656
03:00:48,190 --> 03:00:48,710
Alright.

4657
03:00:49,950 --> 03:00:50,930
This is fine.

4658
03:00:51,830 --> 03:00:52,350
There you go.

4659
03:00:52,410 --> 03:00:54,050
For those who are confused, you can...

4660
03:00:54,050 --> 03:00:55,010
Now you guys know.

4661
03:00:55,950 --> 03:00:58,130
For those who were very confused.

4662
03:01:00,070 --> 03:01:00,590
Wait.

4663
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:01,050
Alright.

4664
03:01:01,130 --> 03:01:01,710
Let me...

4665
03:01:02,890 --> 03:01:04,430
Let me tweet this real quick.

4666
03:01:05,390 --> 03:01:06,870
And just be like, lol.

4667
03:01:13,330 --> 03:01:15,350
No, actually, I got a better idea.

4668
03:01:27,770 --> 03:01:28,470
Okay.

4669
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:32,130
Doki donating a dollar to be over a minute...

4670
03:01:32,130 --> 03:01:33,630
She did it first!

4671
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:35,830
What do you mean?

4672
03:01:36,310 --> 03:01:39,130
If anything, she started it!

4673
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:41,730
She did it first!

4674
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:44,390
There we go.

4675
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:51,990
She started it!

4676
03:01:52,170 --> 03:01:53,870
If anything, I'm just going...

4677
03:01:53,870 --> 03:01:54,530
I'm just...

4678
03:01:55,020 --> 03:01:57,090
Getting my rightful position back.

4679
03:01:57,570 --> 03:01:58,910
Number five.

4680
03:02:00,240 --> 03:02:01,030
There we go.

4681
03:02:02,250 --> 03:02:03,510
Number five.

4682
03:02:07,590 --> 03:02:08,370
Alright.

4683
03:02:08,690 --> 03:02:09,710
And also, I'll link it too.

4684
03:02:11,330 --> 03:02:12,810
For a good cause.

4685
03:02:15,170 --> 03:02:17,230
It's for a good cause.

4686
03:02:20,870 --> 03:02:21,650
Alright.

4687
03:02:31,690 --> 03:02:32,770
There we go.

4688
03:02:36,490 --> 03:02:37,570
Alright, I'll see you guys later.

4689
03:02:37,850 --> 03:02:37,950
Bye.

4690
03:02:38,790 --> 03:02:39,390
For real.
