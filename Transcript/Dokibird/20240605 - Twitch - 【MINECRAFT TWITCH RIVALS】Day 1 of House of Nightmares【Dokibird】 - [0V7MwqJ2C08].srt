1
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh my god, are you an actual bad boy?

2
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,560
Yeah?

3
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,500
What's the baddest thing you've done?

4
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,520
Yeah, name five.

5
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,860
Yeah?

6
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Oh my god, you're a god damn criminal!

7
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,600
You're god damn crazy!

8
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,560
That is hardcore, man.

9
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,570
Whoa!

10
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:38,910
That's...

11
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,250
That's...

12
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,670
That's messed up, man.

13
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,930
That's so messed up.

14
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,120
Like right off the bat?

15
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,630
Oh shit, you guys don't hear it?

16
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,510
You guys don't hear this sound?

17
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,750
Are these just too quiet?

18
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,310
There's no way you guys don't hear this!

19
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,450
Okay, I'm turning it up.

20
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,890
Yeah.

21
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,970
Wait, they said it in general?

22
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,060
You guys don't hear it?

23
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,040
Okay, give me a sec.

24
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,580
Let me fix this.

25
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,900
Oh, there you are.

26
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,720
No, no, no.

27
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,740
It's up to you.

28
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
You can continue streaming something else.

29
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,920
Oh, okay.

30
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,780
Glad they gave me that.

31
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,620
No, you have to end right away.

32
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,380
You have to.

33
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,900
Yeah, yeah, you just end it.

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,060
Wait, you can't even spectate people!

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,000
That's messed up.

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,940
Is that why they gave us their... Is that why they made us give the bar stream key to them?

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,020
So they could extend our stream?

38
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,880
Wait, you gave your stream key?

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
Did you also give their credit card number too?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,400
So they can charge...

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Oh, I think I didn't do that.

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Wait, you guys didn't give them your credit card number too in the last three digits on the back?

43
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,660
I have to go do something really quick.

44
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm sure that'll be alright.

45
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,220
Yeah, that's probably sure.

46
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,060
What are you gonna do?

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,180
We're streamers.

48
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,960
We're broke already.

49
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,840
Yeah.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,460
Yeah.

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,900
Yeah, we're not even gonna get money if we get eliminated in the first four days.

52
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,100
Yeah.

53
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah.

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,260
So, what is the first event?

55
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,580
We're doing this for exposure.

56
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,820
Yeah, exposure.

57
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,640
Yeah.

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah, yeah, that's how they're paying us.

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,100
Do you guys know the first event?

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
Like, what the details are?

62
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,780
Why don't we understand?

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,740
Is it really just a red light, green light?

64
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,900
Is it red light, green light?

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,140
I didn't really understand the rules.

66
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,120
It was like, there's boxes that you can hit to get benefits and stuff.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,400
It's like Mario Kart.

68
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,920
Yeah, it's like Mario Kart, red light, green light.

69
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,140
Like, do you die if you move when the light's off?

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,960
Because it didn't say that.

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,800
Oh my god, what if it's a crab game?

72
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,780
I'm pretty sure this is basically a crab game, but spooky.

73
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,940
Because did you see in the rules?

74
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,040
They were like, you gotta be immersed as if you're actually in a haunted house.

75
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,800
And you gotta roleplay and stuff.

76
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,100
It's like GTA RP.

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,880
But in Minecraft.

78
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
Oh, okay.

79
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,020
Yeah.

80
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,280
I think it's like Crab Game S where you can probably just punch someone to make them move.

81
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,720
And then...

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,940
Oh, that's true.

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,900
But we're allies, right guys?

84
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,900
Yeah, we're allies.

85
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,940
Guys, right?

86
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,900
We're not gonna punch each other, right?

87
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,260
Yeah, no, we're all friends.

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,040
Yeah.

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,560
We're all good.

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
If you punch Gumi and I, you're punching babies.

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,580
Because we just installed Minecraft today.

92
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
Wouldn't wanna do that.

93
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,800
Yeah, you're a baby puncher.

94
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,360
She barely plays Minecraft.

95
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah, I don't even have my own skin.

96
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,580
I'm a bear.

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,180
That's when you know I'm a baby.

98
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,760
Oh, hello.

99
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,580
Hello?

100
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,400
Friends?

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,080
Yeah.

102
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,920
Can you guys hear me?

103
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh, no, we can hear you.

104
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,500
It's just the quality is very terrible because there's a lot of people on the server.

105
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,120
Okay, thank god.

106
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,760
So the more people are eliminated, the better the bandwidth.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,180
Hey guys, how's the volume by the way?

108
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,820
Oh, did you guys see the animatronics?

109
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,060
Oh yeah, the FNAF at home.

110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,680
That's so cool.

111
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

112
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,480
Guys, chat.

113
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,260
Look, look, look, chat.

114
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,480
One of them looked...

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,520
That one's gone.

116
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,080
There's FNAF at home.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,900
Which FNAF?

118
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,660
Huh?

119
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,040
What the heck is...

120
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,660
Your mic...

121
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,860
Your voice chat is so messed up.

122
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,820
We can't hear anything.

123
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,860
It's like...

124
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,630
Oh, that sounds good.

125
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,130
Oh yeah,

126
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,060
look at this server though, guys.

127
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,900
It's actually crazy.

128
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,460
Let's see.

129
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,160
I've never played one of these games.

130
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm gonna make sure sound guy is just double checking stuff for me.

131
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,940
Oh my gosh, I love your skin.

132
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,580
Oh my gosh, I'm a bear farmer!

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,280
Hello!

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,320
Hello!

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,940
Yeah, I'm a bear farmer!

136
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,860
I'm here to farm.

137
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,040
I love it, I love it.

138
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,340
I'm new to Minecraft, this is my first day.

139
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,760
I just installed it today.

140
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,020
Yeah, she just installed it.

141
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,180
She doesn't even know how to crouch.

142
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,980
Yeah, I don't even have my own skin.

143
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,700
That's when you know you should not... you should like let me get through the first round.

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,900
As like a make a wish.

145
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,740
This is my make a wish to get through the first round.

146
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,460
Oh, it's Doki!

147
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,200
Yeah?

148
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,680
His name is Toppo.

149
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,140
Hello!

150
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,540
Hi Kame!

151
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,340
Hi guys!

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,880
Hello Doc!

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
It's me, Doc.

154
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,000
We need to win.

155
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,320
I'm just... yeah, you can just call me Doc.

156
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,260
That's my name.

157
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,840
Alright, I'll call you Doc McStuffins.

158
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,300
That's wrong.

159
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,180
Yeah, that's right.

160
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,840
That is insane.

161
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,100
What do you mean?

162
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,020
Yeah, yeah, what's the copyright free version of this?

163
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,660
For legal reasons, what is the name of these guys?

164
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,000
For legal reasons, what are their names?

165
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,160
Um, we should name them right now.

166
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,940
Uh, this one... what's a good name for this one?

167
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,720
Oh my god.

168
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,820
Um... Ralph.

169
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,740
Oh heck yes.

170
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,520
Oh my god.

171
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,500
This is Ralph.

172
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,380
Five Nights at Ralph's?

173
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
Five Nights at Ralph's?

174
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,040
Um... Poe.

175
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,260
What should the name be?

176
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,600
Poe.

177
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,980
Okay, I think now we're going through legal territory now.

178
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,600
Hahaha.

179
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,580
Now we're going back to maybe getting a cease and desist letter.

180
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,180
Okay, how about, um, Steve?

181
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,700
Oh my god, my favorite game.

182
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,580
Five Nights at Steve's.

183
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,500
Oh, Minecraft has Steve copyrighted.

184
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,300
Is that... come on, that's crazy.

185
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,400
No, maybe like Bartholomew.

186
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,100
Yeah.

187
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,960
Ooh, now you're cooking, Hannah.

188
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,680
That's actually a good name.

189
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
Yeah, what is it?

190
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,800
What if... yeah?

191
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,380
What if there's hide and seek in the next few days?

192
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,880
I've been looking around for good hiding spots.

193
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,060
Oh, is there actually hide and seek?

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,160
Wait, you're friends with the admin.

195
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,520
Ask her.

196
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,240
Ask her what the game...

197
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,280
No!

198
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,300
You're literally friends with the creators.

199
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,400
Ask them what the games are.

200
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,080
You're right.

201
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,520
Let me ask.

202
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,200
Just be like, hey, I'll never tell people what the games are.

203
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,340
But like, you know I'm not gonna make it to the next rounds, but I'm just curious.

204
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,820
What are the next couple of games?

205
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,180
Oh, I like that.

206
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,680
I like that.

207
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,140
Yeah, Doki.

208
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,920
Send that DM right now.

210
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,840
Don't worry, I have your stream open so you can send it whenever.

211
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,640
So... because you...

212
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,660
Oh, look.

213
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,300
This is a pretty good hiding spot.

214
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,900
Oh, shit.

215
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,980
Wait, that's actually insane.

216
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,500
I don't even know how I can get up there.

217
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,480
You can't see me at all.

218
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,400
Yeah, I can only see your name.

219
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,080
Wait, no, I don't even...

220
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,880
Wait, where are you?

221
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,020
Where did you go?

222
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,020
Where did you go?

223
00:10:59,560 --> 00:10:59,960
Wait.

224
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,460
Do you not see me?

225
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,320
No, I don't.

226
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,180
Your name tag disappeared.

227
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,100
Hiding spot.

228
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
Yeah, your name tag disappeared.

229
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,320
Also, are we supposed to like reconvene somewhere?

230
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,380
What did they start the first game without?

231
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,340
I don't know.

232
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,200
That would be pretty embarrassing if we just got instantly eliminated.

233
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,280
Alright, I'm gonna double check the announcement.

234
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,200
Oh, apparently not...

235
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,640
Oh, let's see.

236
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,880
Not everybody's in the server yet.

237
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,620
Wait, what the heck?

238
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,240
They're late.

239
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,600
They're 12 minutes late.

240
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,500
Eliminate them.

241
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,200
How dare they?

242
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,020
Eliminate them.

243
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Right now.

244
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,460
Wait, if we eliminate the 12 people, only 8 people have to be eliminated on the next one.

245
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,320
Because they're late.

246
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,240
Oh my god.

247
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,280
That means we get to go through the first round for free.

248
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,220
I think so too.

249
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,980
Wait, do you see me here?

250
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,700
Nope, I don't even know where you are.

251
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,020
Oh wait, I see you.

252
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

253
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,620
How did you do that?

254
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,940
Slash TP.

255
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,440
Yeah, you can tell me.

256
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,980
Slash TP.

257
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,080
I see you.

258
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,000
You don't need to see it.

259
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,040
And then you gotta run around and jump on that bush.

260
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,940
What the fuck?

261
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,780
The one I'm standing on.

262
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,760
I can barely see.

263
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,400
Okay.

264
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,960
Okay.

265
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
I can't even see anything.

266
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,740
You got this.

267
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,020
Okay.

268
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,660
Yeah, stand right where you need to jump.

269
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,320
Am I standing in the right area?

270
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:43,600
You're doing a good job.

271
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,560
Wait, maybe I'm gonna up the brightness.

272
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:46,960
And then you run forward.

273
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,660
How do I up the brightness?

274
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,460
I'm just gonna try and up the brightness.

275
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,040
Oh.

276
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,600
Okay.

277
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,800
Okay, I up the brightness.

278
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,620
I still can barely see, but that's okay.

279
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,500
Run forward, jump.

280
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,020
Run forward, jump.

281
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,960
Okay.

282
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:02,640
Okay.

283
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,300
You're hitting this wall.

284
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,320
You have to make it pass the wall and then turn in.

285
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,240
Oh no.

286
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,680
And apparently there's a parkour course later.

287
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,220
Oh, I made it!

288
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,180
Oh, almost.

289
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
You made it one under.

290
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,700
Oh.

291
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,580
Wait, are you above me?

292
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:16,940
Yeah.

293
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,560
Oh.

294
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah, yeah, look up.

295
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,260
Oh, okay.

297
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,340
Okay.

298
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,500
Oh, why is this so dark?

299
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,720
Oh, no!

300
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,620
I give up.

301
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,660
I'll just die.

302
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,520
I'll die underneath you.

303
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,940
So they'll know that you're...

304
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,380
So they're like, oh, we got the person.

305
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,440
So they'll run away and then you'll be safe.

306
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,200
Oh my God.

307
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,540
And then I split the money with you.

308
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,920
And then you split $1,000, like $65.

310
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,300
$60, $40.

311
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,840
$60 for me.

312
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,360
$70,000.

313
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
$60, $40.

314
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,320
What?

315
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,560
I helped you get to the end.

316
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,820
If it wasn't for me, you'd be caught.

317
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,580
All I'm saying...

318
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,520
When are we going to go to Japan together?

319
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,360
And you promised to pay for part of it.

320
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,800
Oh, you did it!

321
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,480
You did it!

322
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,540
Wait, I did it, but I jumped away!

323
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:14,780
Okay.

324
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,220
Oh, I'm so sorry.

325
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,080
No!

326
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,100
You jumped.

327
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,400
I keep jumping past it.

328
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,460
But if we all...

329
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,700
But if we're both on the same hiding spot, wouldn't we both die at the same time?

330
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,120
No, because look...

331
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,660
It's like...

332
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,760
Okay, get up here.

333
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,480
Get up.

334
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,340
Get up.

335
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm here.

336
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,300
I'm here.

337
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,000
They can't see me.

338
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,820
They can't...

339
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,300
Make the jump.

340
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,760
Make the jump.

341
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,260
Okay, okay, okay.

342
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,000
I can see you very clearly.

343
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,680
They can't see me.

344
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,000
No!

345
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,500
I keep fucking...

346
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:43,680
Okay.

347
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,380
I can't make the jump.

348
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,880
Hold your crouch button.

349
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:46,880
Okay.

350
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,940
Oh my God.

351
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,960
Pro Minecraft trap.

352
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,380
Oh my God.

353
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,740
We did it.

354
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,420
Jump up here.

355
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,380
And then you stay in that corner.

356
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
I'll stay in the other corner.

357
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,500
Okay.

358
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,720
Because I can't see you.

359
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,300
Yeah, yeah.

360
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,000
You don't know where I am.

361
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,100
I can't see anything either.

362
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,700
Girl, you just walked into me.

363
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,520
But I can't see anything.

364
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,780
And then if you hold crouch, you hide your name tag.

365
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,820
Oh, wait.

366
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,480
That's so smart.

367
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,440
Oh my God.

369
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,100
We're going to win this.

370
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,900
We're going to so win that $70,000.

371
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:15,860
$60,000.

372
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,260
$70,000 in $70,000.

373
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,100
$70,000.

374
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,500
All right.

375
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,860
So, guys.

376
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
All right, guys.

377
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,220
So, this is a custom Minecraft horror map.

378
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,600
They actually made an entire installation for this.

379
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,600
There was a whole folder.

380
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,240
Oh my God.

381
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,140
Who wants to put them out right now?

382
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,920
Yeah, call them out on stream.

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
Yeah, I called him out on stream.

384
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,440
I called him about on stream.

385
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,280
Yeah.

386
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,420
I let him call.

387
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,320
It's like a world pack and you just download the file.

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,000
And then like... wait, is that Mickey Mouse?

389
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,240
Oh my god, Mickey's in the server.

390
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,440
Oh my god.

391
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,980
I can't believe they got Mickey.

392
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,840
Yeah, so like basically we're not even using the Minecraft launcher.

393
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,680
We're using a custom launcher for this.

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,120
So like all your texture packs, resource packs don't even show up for this one.

395
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,100
So like when you install it, everything is already there.

396
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,940
Are you gonna make tacos?

397
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,060
Okay, I'll talk to my chat then.

398
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,620
Can you talk to my chat too?

399
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:32,960
Okay.

400
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,460
Okay, I'll talk to your chat as well.

401
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,080
Okay, don't worry, I'll entertain your chat as well.

402
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,140
Are you gone yet?

403
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,820
Okay.

404
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,540
Oh.

405
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,120
Are you still here?

406
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,700
Yeah, tell a story that I would tell your chat.

407
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,620
Okay, okay.

408
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,240
When you're gone.

409
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Let me know when you're gone.

410
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,780
I'm gone.

411
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,680
Okay.

412
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,580
Are you still here?

413
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,360
Okay, alright.

414
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,680
So people in Gumi's chat, come to my...

415
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,900
I stream on YouTube.

416
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,600
You son of a bitch.

417
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,280
You son of a bitch.

418
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,100
I knew you would do this.

419
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,000
I didn't leave because I knew it.

420
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,660
I didn't leave because I knew it.

421
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,200
Well, I knew you didn't leave so I was testing you.

422
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,100
I was testing you to see if you're still here or not.

423
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,280
I knew you didn't leave.

424
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,900
I'm not even gonna tell you when I leave.

425
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,780
Just keep talking.

426
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,100
Okay.

427
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,160
Anyway, guys.

428
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,960
Anyway, so I was talking to my chat about this map because I don't know if Gumi's here.

429
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,680
I don't know if Gumi introduced it.

430
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,880
But basically, this is a Twitch Rivals Minecraft.

431
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Oh, hi.

432
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,020
I came from Gumi's chat.

433
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,760
Oh, hey.

434
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,160
Hey.

435
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,360
Anyway, so this is basically full... everything in here was like custom made just for this event.

436
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,540
So there's like 150 participants.

437
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,320
And it's basically like Squid Game but what if it's spooky?

438
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,400
So it's like a haunted mansion.

439
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,940
It's so funny because in the rules, they were like, please roll.

440
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:09,200
Play and immerse your viewers and immerse all the other participants as if you're really trapped in the haunted house.

441
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,520
And I was like reading that.

442
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,820
I was like, what the fuck?

443
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,800
So, but it's actually crazy though.

444
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,480
The amount of detail and the amount of like the amount of like effort they put into this entire world because everything is custom here.

445
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,420
Like you see the resource packs, the like the voice chat and everything.

446
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,920
And like almost everything.

447
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,900
Everything in here was just like Squid Game.

448
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,200
But like what if it's a haunted mansion type deal?

449
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,060
And apparently there's going to be two games.

450
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,500
It's going to last like six days or something.

451
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,760
But each day people get eliminated.

452
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,160
And apparently the first game is some red light green light thing.

453
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,300
I read the rules for the first two games because every day is like two games.

454
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,420
And I got so confused because I didn't even realize it was supposed to be red light green light.

455
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,020
I was like looking at it.

456
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,820
I'm like, this is red light green light.

457
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,000
But maybe I'm illiterate.

458
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,500
Anyway, so I think like the first game 20 people gets eliminated.

459
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,340
And then I don't know what happens the second game because I'm going to see if I can survive the first game.

460
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,660
And yeah, they're like you can have allies and everything.

461
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,520
Oh, yeah.

462
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,160
Apparently the rules was like you should not be swearing.

463
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,940
But like I guess like you could swear on your own stream.

464
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,420
But like not like during voice chat.

465
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,080
I assume.

466
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,780
But like I'm already talking in voice chat.

467
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,680
So like, oh, this is going to be an issue.

468
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,200
But they're like no profanity.

469
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,200
So like, yeah, I'm pretty sure I broke the rules already.

470
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,840
When it comes to profanity.

471
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,540
But there's like 150 people here.

472
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,260
Only top 20 wins money.

473
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
But don't worry.

474
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,440
We're just doing this for exposure.

475
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,060
I know there's like lots of Minecraft players on here.

476
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,980
Because there's a Minecraft event.

477
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,060
So like, yeah, we're not going to be making it to top 20.

478
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,920
Because Minecraft players are at a whole other level.

479
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,740
They've been doing like these Minecraft like the...

480
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,140
And what was it called?

481
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,520
The Minecraft championship.

482
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,540
The MCC shit like that.

483
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,720
They've been doing this on the daily.

484
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,680
So...

485
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,720
If we make it past day one, that's a win on my book.

486
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,800
Anyway, it's fun though.

487
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,940
I got me lots of Goomy's friends.

488
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,220
And talking to a lot of people.

489
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,660
But yeah, Minecraft players are at a whole other level when it comes to minigames.

490
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,580
So like, it'd be nice to just survive the first day.

491
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,920
I hope Goomy's chat was entertaining.

492
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,020
Got like exposition for this tournament.

493
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,120
But yeah, anyway.

494
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,700
If I don't live past day one.

495
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,700
Then it's rest week for me.

496
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,240
Yay!

497
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,620
I get to...

498
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,660
It's a win-win!

499
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,840
If I make it past day one.

500
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,280
Wow!

501
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,920
I beat some Minecraft players on day one.

502
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,920
If I don't make it past day one.

503
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,460
Yay!

504
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,260
I get a vacation.

505
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,240
So...

506
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,020
So it's a win-win honestly.

507
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,860
But yeah, a lot of...

508
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,300
Yeah.

509
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,980
I mean they got a hundred and...

510
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,400
I mean they got a hundred and fifty streamers.

511
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
That is an accomplishment on its own.

512
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,340
Because they managed to get a hundred and fifty streamers.

513
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,200
To coordinate their schedules for this one event.

514
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,360
And that's like...

515
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,160
It's very difficult to get like thirty.

516
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,720
I had a rough time.

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,320
Coordinating the schedule for like thirty people.

518
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,020
So think about a hundred and fifty in one place.

519
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,280
Yeah.

520
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,800
It's actually crazy though.

521
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,420
It's crazy.

522
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,540
It's Minecraft.

523
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,520
Not like they had...

524
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
I'm DUCK!

525
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,280
I mean they'll be playing Minecraft anyway.

526
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,020
But yeah.

527
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,220
It's basically like a merge of like different streamers.

528
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,860
From different communities.

529
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,560
There's like Spanish streamers too.

530
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,180
Because there's the server.

531
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,680
The Discord server.

532
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,840
Was...

533
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,200
Has like instructions in both Spanish and English.

534
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,400
Because like I know like Minecraft is really, really popular.

535
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,060
Yeah I was so surprised i didn't realize Minecraft.

536
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:55,560
I guess like quackity it would make sense because quackity is like one of their biggest streamers on twitch um but yeah minecraft is like incredibly popular um uh for spanish speaker viewers Viewers...

537
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,120
Are you back yet?

538
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,040
Did you make your taco?

539
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,000
Okay guys, anyway, on Gumi's chat...

540
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,900
For those who don't know me, I'm DokiBird.

541
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,920
You can find me on Twitch right now if you really want to have some streamer interactions.

542
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,860
I mean, she's not... how is she gonna know?

543
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,460
I'm surprised we haven't started yet.

544
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,680
What are we still waiting on?

545
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,800
Also, have you guys heard about Twitch Prime, Gumi's chat?

546
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,360
So Twitch Prime is basically...

547
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,960

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

569
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,060
I was talking... I was hyping you up, Gumi.

570
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, because that's my wife right there.

571
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,240
Yeah, I gave like explanation.

572
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,380
I don't know if you like explain the server stuff.

573
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,780
I don't know.

574
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,500
Honestly, I'm just saying ball.

575
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,100
Like, budget we bought.

576
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,640
Fuck it.

577
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,200
Whoa!

578
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,680
Wait, did you see the rule where we're supposed to put it on email only mode when we start the game?

579
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,060
Yeah.

580
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,540
Are you gonna do that?

581
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,560
I already did it, man.

582
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,060
Oh, that's why they're in my chat talk.

583
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,080
That makes sense.

584
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,580
I didn't do it.

585
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:38,260
So yeah, for those who don't know, we're supposed to put our chats at emote only mode to prevent people from cheating and ghosting and stuff.

586
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,160
But like they said, we can do it when the game starts.

587
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,200
The game hasn't started yet.

588
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
That's the thing.

589
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,000
So yeah, my mods.

590
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,240
The moment the first round starts.

591
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
Please put it at emote only mode.

592
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,720
I'm not gonna forget.

593
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,660
It's so freaking good.

594
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,000
Are you eating your taco?

595
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,340
Yeah, I'll give you a taco.

596
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,000
Whoa!

597
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,320
In front of everybody?

598
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,960
It's a pretty inside a taco.

599
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,000
What?

600
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,540
Yeah?

601
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,160
What?

602
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:12,780
Yeah?

603
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,260
Yeah.

604
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,080
Yeah.

605
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,080
Yeah.

606
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,360
Yeah.

607
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,280
Yeah.

608
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,540
Yeah.

609
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,100
Should we go explore a little bit more?

610
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,360
Hey, there's Link.

611
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:25,780
You want me to sit on taco?

612
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,920
You want me to sit on taco?

613
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,080
You have one.

614
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,840
You have two hands.

615
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,140
One hand can eat the taco.

616
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,940
Okay, then I'm gonna go push a taco then.

617
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,800
Yeah, take voice activation.

618
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,700
Let them hear your voice.

619
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:42,940
What?

620
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,320
Let them hear your voice.

621
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,020
I'm on voice activation.

622
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,580
Let's go.

623
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,260
All right, let's go.

624
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,980
Wait, I should do voice activation too.

625
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,460
Let me...

626
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,820
Wait, how do I do this?

627
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
Press to disable...

628
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,500
Press to start recording.

629
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,780
How do I...

630
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,620
How do I do act...

631
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,120
Oh, there it is.

632
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,380
All right.

633
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,560
She's eating a taco.

634
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,100
Wait, Doki, look!

635
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,120
Mickey Mouse is my friend!

636
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,340
Oh my God, it's Mickey Mouse!

637
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,980
You got invited?

638
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,380
It's me, Mickey Mouse.

639
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,300
Oh my...

640
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,640
What the hell?

641
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,620
Wait, that's so cool.

642
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,420
Wait...

643
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,100
Oh my God.

644
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,900
I can't believe it.

645
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,660
This event is sponsored by Disney?

646
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,360
Okay.

647
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,360
I'm so...

648
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,080
Unmute yourself.

649
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,600
Oh shit.

650
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,800
Am I unmuted?

651
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,080
Am I good?

652
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,360
Can you hear me?

653
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,240
Oh no.

654
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,140
No!

655
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,740
How do I...

656
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,140
Oh wait, it's okay.

657
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,040
Okay, I can hear.

658
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,260
Yeah.

659
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,920
Hello?

660
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,640
Oh, hello.

661
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
Oh my God, it's so cool.

662
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,760
I can't believe it.

663
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,260
Disney sponsored Minecraft.

664
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,520
Yeah, they did.

665
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,120
Some people have an aura.

666
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,880
That's crazy.

667
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,080
It's not that that's bad, you know.

668
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,340
No, the hand was just like...

669
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,820
Mom!

670
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,480
It felt...

671
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,660
Mom!

672
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,440
She's eating a taco right now.

673
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,160
Mm-hmm.

674
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,140
I just made a carton shot of tacos.

675
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,640
Oh shit!

676
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,460
Whoa!

677
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,660
Tacos are so sweet!

678
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,700
I mean, oh my God!

679
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,100
Oh my God!

680
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,740
I'm sorry for putting a Lord in the house.

681
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,440
I'm just gonna use his name in vain.

682
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,760
Uncle Baby Billy!

683
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,040
Can you guys still hear me?

684
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,580
Yeah, we can hear ya.

685
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,880
There's a cutscene?

686
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,980
Oh my God!

687
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,760
1984.

688
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,240
Oh My God!

689
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,600
The fight!

690
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,680
The fit of 1984!

691
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,820
The fight of 1984!

692
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,680
Hello, everybody.

693
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,720
Welcome back to...

694
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,520
That's how I play Balor!

695
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,280
How do we skip this cutscene?

696
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,940
We don't need lore?

697
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
Oh my god.

698
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,900
This is so elaborate!

699
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,260
It's okay, the round hasn't started yet, guys!

700
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,540
We're fine!

701
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,680
The moment the round started, then we do it.

702
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,210
Who are these people?

703
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,750
The thing is, I don't know if these guys can hear me when I'm talking right now.

704
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,750
Because I have push... okay, I don't think they can because no one said anything.

705
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:00,970
To me.

706
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,410
No one said like, shut the heck up.

707
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,690
I just assumed nobody could hear me.

708
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,410
So I had to pause and be like, okay, wait, I can't swear.

709
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,050
I could probably say something.

710
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,510
No, I'm on voice activation because I got lazy.

711
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,670
Oh my god, chicken!

712
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,680
Maplewood Town, September 13th.

713
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,840
I have no idea what is going on!

714
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
Like, where did the haunted house come in?

715
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,940
Like, when does that come into play?

716
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,900
Oh, is that the house?

717
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,880
Oh no, that's the house!

718
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,120
Oh, is that the house?

719
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,460
Yeah, I know, but I'm just like, thinking...

720
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh my god, this is like a debut stream.

721
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,300
The lore video that's like 15-20 minutes long.

722
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,180
We're watching a VTuber debut now.

723
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,090
Oh, we're like news reporters!

724
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,930
They sent in like 150 new...

725
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,390
What the heck?

726
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,230
What is...

727
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,390
They sent in 150 news reporters to get in the...

728
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,950
To figure out what's going on in the haunted house.

729
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,530
We need every angle.

730
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,490
Yeah, we sent in 150.

731
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,050
One of them will go viral.

732
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,660
Even like five news cards...

733
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,780
Wait, is it like one person per card?

734
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,500
Okay, now that's excessive.

735
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,840
Each news reporter brought in their own card.

736
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,050
Who cares about global warming?

737
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,150
They don't know about card pooling.

738
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,670
The CO2 emissions go crazy.

739
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,460
Oh, what the heck?

740
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,180
There's ghosts?

741
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,500
There's ghosts?

742
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,780
Oh my god, it's so spooky!

743
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,800
Why are you here?

744
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm here to report the news.

745
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,580
I'm here to represent BBC News.

746
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,660
Oh, there's 46... Oh, sweet!

747
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,800
Four people already got eliminated.

748
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,780
I mean, sucks for them, but...

749
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,740
Did you see that?

750
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,080
Four people already got eliminated!

751
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,660
I don't have permission to speak?

752
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,020
Yeah, you guys are in my mind.

753
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,440
I don't have permission to speak.

754
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,500
Silence, Tokyo.

755
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,220
No!

756
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,860
They actually silenced us!

757
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,920
Oh, we can talk now!

758
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,960
I can hear you guys!

759
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,060
Oh my god!

760
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,800
I thought they silenced us!

761
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,720
They just trauma-dumped on us.

762
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,080
Yeah.

763
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,160
So, are we like news reporters here?

764
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,800
150 news reporters?

765
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,220
I think so.

766
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,380
I think so.

767
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,080
I think we're the TV people.

768
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,780
Oh my god.

769
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
It's like that movie.

770
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,860
You guys wanna see this hiding spot I found?

771
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,760
Oh, wait.

772
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
If you're the seeking...

773
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,500
Oh my god, it's like that Will Ferrell movie where they send in all the news reporters to fight.

774
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,260
It's just like that Will Ferrell movie.

775
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,520
It's so dark up here.

776
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

777
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,880
If there's hide and seek, Gumi found the perfect spot.

778
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,740
They can't see us for fair.

779
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:15,860
Whoa!

780
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,680
Oh!

781
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,340
Oh!

782
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:18,660
Oh no!

783
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
I didn't have emote's only mode!

784
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,160
Where are my mods?

785
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,020
Can I

786
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,630
look at this?

787
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,430
Oh yeah, sure.

788
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,450
Yeah, of course.

789
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,090
Yeah.

790
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,670
Okay, but I'm like a baby though, so...

791
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,690
Wait, can I get promoted to wife number two if I play Valorant with you?

792
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,330
You'll get promoted to my one and only...

793
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,710
Okay, absolutely then.

794
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,170
Okay, wait.

795
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,610
I need to put mod only mode.

796
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,810
How do I put mod only mode?

797
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,870
Guys, I don't know how to do it.

798
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,010
Guys!

799
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,570
Wait, wait.

800
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,210
Emote.

801
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,850
Okay, I'm gonna message.

802
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:04,130
Can you help me put on emote only mode on my stream?

803
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:04,890
Sorry.

804
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,030
Caps.

805
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,310
It's okay.

806
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:08,410
It's okay.

807
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,430
I personally messaged a mod to show up.

808
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,950
Because I'm still... I'm a bit lazy.

809
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:16,990
Yeah, see?

810
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,470
You get some good hard spots.

811
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,010
Yeah, but what if you don't make it to the round to do this?

812
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,350
Well, you got to put it on my list.

813
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,470
Oh yeah.

814
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,690
Boob Bears, if you got to the finals, you got to split 60-40.

815
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,990
Well, it's gonna be 60-20-20.

816
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:35,810
Oh, true.

817
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,930
60-20-20.

818
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,810
So I get 60 and you two get 20.

819
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,190
Got it.

820
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,250
Yeah.

821
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,230
Yeah.

822
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,250
Yeah, so like if FruBarris win first place...

823
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,930
And because we showed him the god spot...

824
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,710
Um...

825
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,170
Yeah, that seems fair.

826
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:51,850
Yeah.

827
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,710
I'll give away all my money.

828
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,390
I think that's pretty fair.

829
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,930
You have Minecraft money.

830
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,050
You don't need $70,000.

831
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,230
You have Minecraft money?

832
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,250
This guy got Minecraft money.

833
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,450
Yeah, you got Minecraft money.

834
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,690
I bet $70,000 to you is like an apple.

835
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,110
It's a lot.

836
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,030
It's not.

837
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,850
It's a lot of an apple.

838
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,030
Guys.

839
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,510
I don't know about that.

840
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,010
Dude, I just finished my two tacos.

841
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,230
It was so freaking good.

842
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,210
Ooh.

843
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,070
Yumbo.

844
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:27,590
What?

845
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,230
I guess...

846
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,490
It was Chinese Soda Tacos with salsa verde and...

847
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,090
Ooh.

848
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,090
Ooh, that sounds so good.

849
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,230
What a goodness questions.

850
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,710
I'm so delicious.

851
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,250
So like...

852
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:38,870
It's elevating.

853
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,530
Are we...

854
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,270
After two minutes and 30 seconds, do we get like TP to the first game?

855
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:43,870
We die.

856
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,470
We die.

857
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,090
Okay, because I'm going to be like...

858
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,490
It'll be a bit awkward if like we're supposed to head to the place or something.

859
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,350
Maybe.

860
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,310
Because we're like, you have two minutes...

861
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,230
No, everybody's gone.

862
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,410
That's the spooky part.

863
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,490
Uh-oh.

864
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,730
Everybody's missing.

865
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,290
I don't know.

866
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:00,850
People are gone.

867
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,030
Oh.

868
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,470
People are disconnected.

869
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,710
A lot of people disconnected to fix their voice.

870
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,310
Oh.

871
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,130
Okay.

872
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,710
Oh, no.

873
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,430
There's people up front.

874
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:06,770
Okay.

875
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,550
Nice.

876
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,330
Six people already got eliminated.

877
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,090
So like...

878
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,070
Before the games even started.

879
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,030
So we have a chance.

880
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,220
Yippee.

881
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,040
Yay.

882
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:19,920
Yay.

883
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,120
I feel like we should have the...

884
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,180
Inside.

885
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,140
Oh, yeah.

886
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,360
Yeah.

887
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,300
We didn't get to explore inside.

888
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,720
We only went to like one room.

889
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,940
I'm actually like lost.

890
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,180
We only had to explore one room and that was it.

891
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,520
Yeah.

892
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,040
Yeah.

893
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,480
Yeah.

894
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:36,940
We got to explore.

895
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,340
That's not coffee.

896
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,100
Buddy passback.

897
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,780
Nice, Emu.

898
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,220
What do you say hi to?

899
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,500
Oh, my god.

900
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,980
There's a skull.

901
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,100
Oh, my god.

902
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,660
There's a couple of friends over there too.

903
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,480
Yeah.

904
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,460
I'm kind of scared.

905
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,980
What if we go in this room and our voices start laughing out again.

906
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,680
Oh, my god.

907
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,540
No, it's already starting.

908
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,420
Oh, shit.

909
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,360
There's so many of you.

910
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,400
You're going to go find me.

911
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,440
You're going to go find me.

912
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,580
Doki run!

913
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,260
Doki run!

914
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,120
Doki run!

915
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Quick!

916
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,320
We gotta get our bandwidth back, Gumi!

917
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:11,840
Bye!

918
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,880
We gotta get our bandwidth!

919
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,260
No, man.

920
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,380
It's Gumi.

921
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,380
Get that through your head.

922
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,440
Get that through your head.

923
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,680
Doki and Gumi.

924
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,800
Call me Doki.

925
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,380
Yeah!

926
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,120
Look, it's two bears!

927
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:29,800
Yeah!

928
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,600
Oh my god, bears unite!

929
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,180
I'm a bear farmer.

930
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,480
Oh, what is that?

931
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,080
Oh, what did I just watch?

932
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:36,880
Do you farm bears?

933
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah, I farm bears.

934
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,820
I farm you.

935
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,400
Alright,

936
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,840
let's head over.

937
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,700
We gotta get our bandwidth back.

938
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,640
Alright guys, I still...

939
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:00,260
I still don't have... I have zero mods on my... It's an anarchy right now in my chat.

940
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,140
What?

941
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,600
None of the mods are online today for me.

942
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,840
That's crazy.

943
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,980
It's not looking so...

944
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,540
Oh no!

945
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,660
Doki!

946
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,880
Okay.

947
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,940
We got...

948
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,660
We're together!

949
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,860
Hold up my hand!

950
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,120
Gumi!

951
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,550
Oh no.

952
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,270
I'm scared.

953
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,870
There's so many people!

954
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,810
There's so many people!

955
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,850
Oh my god!

956
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,070
There's so many people.

957
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,150
Okay.

958
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,110
Where?

959
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,110
There's too many people.

960
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:52,790
I can't!

961
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,990
I can't tap out to Toshimono-only mode!

962
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,390
Where's my mod?

963
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,310
Where is it?

964
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,490
I don't see the names here!

965
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,670
I'm trying to find Goofy!

966
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:20,450
I think I have time to start email only mode here.

967
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,830
If I tab out, I think I have time.

968
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,790
Okay, what was it?

969
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,150
There we go.

970
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:29,950
No!

971
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:30,890
I can't!

972
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,530
Because I'm

973
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,060
not on this mod!

974
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,200
No!

975
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,820
Where are my mods?

976
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,600
Oh no!

977
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,000
Wait.

978
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,000
The time started.

979
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,640
Oh no.

980
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,500
Oh no.

981
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,140
I can't!

982
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
None of my mods are on!

983
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,720
Oh no, it started!

984
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,440
What?

985
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,540
Oh wait, everything is quiet now.

986
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Oh thank god.

987
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,740
Oh thank god.

988
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,240
But where's Goofy?

989
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Where's Goofy?

990
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,280
She was going to put me on her backpack!

991
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,040
Oh!

992
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,340
My mod is on!

993
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,880
I don't know where my mod was that put it on, but thank you!

994
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,740
We did it!

995
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,220
Oh my god, another bear!

996
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,600
Oh my god!

997
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,420
Bears unite!

998
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Where is she?

999
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,660
Friends.

1000
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,800
Where's- Oh wait, it's like 4 minutes until we start?

1001
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,420
I assume so, right?

1002
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,080
I assume it's like 4 minutes until we start.

1003
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,960
I hope so.

1004
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,400
Oh like, did they- Did the voice chat just get dc'd for everybody?

1005
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,340
I think it did.

1006
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,260
I think they shut down the voice chat for everybody!

1007
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,060
I think they shut down the voice chat for everybody!

1008
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,480
Nobody's talking.

1009
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,840
Oh my god.

1010
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,240
I see a lot of disconnected right now.

1011
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,360
Can't have you guys tell me what's actually going on.

1012
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,040
This is emote only.

1013
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,980
I can't believe it.

1014
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,320
Where people are.

1015
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,740
Where people at?

1016
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,800
There's so many Minecraft skins.

1017
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,160
There's no way 150 people are right here.

1018
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,600
Right now.

1019
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,500
That's a lot of people.

1020
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,040
Oh my god.

1021
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,500
There's so many actual Minecraft players.

1022
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,280
Because they have the creeper cape.

1023
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,160
Right?

1024
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,420
The cape means that you are an OG player.

1025
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:39,920
Right?

1026
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,820
I actually don't know.

1027
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,240
I don't know much about the Minecraft lore.

1028
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,580
Wait.

1029
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,420
You guys can't even fact check me because you're all on emote mode.

1030
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,660
You guys can't...

1031
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,940
I can't even get fact checked.

1032
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,020
Because you're all on emote mode.

1033
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,140
No!

1034
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,240
That means I can say the most ridiculous things and nobody can stop me.

1035
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,700
Nobody can be like I'm actually me.

1036
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,900
Oh my god.

1037
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,140
How do I fucking...

1038
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,420
How do I fucking banter when my entire chat is just emojis?

1039
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,720
Like it's talking to a kindergartner.

1040
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,980
Still trying to find people.

1041
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:22,880
Wait.

1042
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,200
It just went back to five minutes.

1043
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,880
It reset.

1044
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,900
It reset itself.

1045
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,500
I'm so confused.

1046
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,400
I'm so...

1047
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,080
I can't be like...

1048
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,740
Hey guys.

1049
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,220
Are people hearing anything?

1050
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,960
On like the other streams?

1051
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,380
On like the other streams?

1052
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,820
Or did everybody else's voice chat also crashed?

1053
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,480
Or did everybody else's voice chat also crashed?

1054
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,720
Or like doesn't work anymore?

1055
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,760
I can't say...

1056
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
I can't ask you guys.

1057
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,460
But...

1058
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,380
Start where...

1059
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,680
Countdown will restart once disconnected.

1060
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,020
Start where it left off.

1061
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,780
Oh!

1062
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,040
So am I supposed to reconnect?

1063
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,720
Because the voice chat is off?

1064
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,040
Oh maybe like...

1065
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,540
Oh maybe like it crashed itself.

1066
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,220
Okay.

1067
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,780
So do I have to reconnect?

1068
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,180
I'm scared of reconnecting.

1069
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,560
I guess I can reconnect right?

1070
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,640
I don't know.

1071
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,700
I DON'T KNOW!

1072
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,100
BECAUSE YOU GUYS CAN'T TALK TO ME!

1073
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,560
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD RECONNECT!

1074
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,580
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD RECONNECT!

1075
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,560
Yay or nay?

1076
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
Do I reconnect?

1077
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,200
Yay for...

1078
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,440
Log out?

1079
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,360
Reconnect?

1080
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,440
Nay for like...

1081
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,160
Don't reconnect.

1082
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,700
Guys.

1083
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,280
I mean... Yay or nay guys?

1084
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,440
I DON'T KNOW!

1085
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,320
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!

1086
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,420
Okay.

1087
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,880
Please do not dis...

1088
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,100
Oh!

1089
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,540
Oh!

1090
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,400
Okay nevermind!

1091
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,500
Admin stopped me!

1092
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,440
Nevermind!

1093
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,760
Okay.

1094
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,480
JK I don't need your help.

1095
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,740
The admin stopped me.

1096
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,520
Before I could do anything.

1097
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,480
Thank god.

1098
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,100
I was about to...

1099
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,200
I was about to do it.

1100
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,340
There's just so many skins here.

1101
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:18,800
There's just so many skins here.

1102
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,600
I didn't realize there were a lot of bears.

1103
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,260
I didn't realize there were a lot of bears.

1104
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
There's actually a lot of like big Minecraft players.

1105
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,860
Isn't Tubbo like a really famous Minecraft streamer?

1106
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,420
Isn't Tubbo like a really famous Minecraft streamer?

1107
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,660
Oh and...

1108
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,580
I was just like...

1109
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,560
Look at this guy.

1110
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,540
I'm like trying to find...

1111
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,300
I'm like trying to find...

1112
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,820
Trying to find...

1113
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,540
Oh he is!

1114
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,620
Oh shit!

1115
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,360
Oh my god!

1116
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,480
I can't believe it.

1117
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,040
I'm a true Minecraft player now.

1118
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,140
I'm a true Minecraft player now.

1119
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,740
Wait is that Elmo in a fucking bikini?

1120
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,580
But we can't say fuck!

1121
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,040
But we can't say fuck!

1122
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,320
But we can't say fuck!

1123
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,320
Wait that's Elmo in a bikini.

1124
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,800
But we can't swear.

1125
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,740
Like I've been trying to find...

1126
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,320
Kumi this entire time.

1127
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,860
And I can't.

1128
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,380
I found so many other people.

1129
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,020
Oh there's Rosita.

1130
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,380
Doodle.

1131
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,240
I know her.

1132
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,180
She's a Vtuber.

1133
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,100
Let's see.

1134
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,980
I'm just slowly moving through the queue.

1135
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,500
I'm just slowly moving through the queue.

1136
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,960
Moving through the queue right now.

1137
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,620
To see if I can find her.

1138
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,120
Like I mean six people have already been eliminated.

1139
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:41,720
So...

1140
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,040
Wait no eight people.

1141
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,520
Eight people have already been eliminated.

1142
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,960
So like at best like...

1143
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,380
As long as I'm not like...

1144
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,320
The 15th...

1145
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,560
As long as I'm not like as bad as like 15 other players.

1146
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,200
I should win this.

1147
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,460
Why are there people in this corner?

1148
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,860
Like that's really it.

1149
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,860
Oh wait.

1150
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,540
Oh my god.

1151
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,680
I found her.

1152
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,440
I did it guys.

1153
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,460
We did it.

1154
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,500
We found each other.

1155
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,360
Now she can carry me.

1156
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,900
I'm gonna use her...

1157
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,120
I'm gonna use her friendship with all the other Minecraft players.

1158
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,000
To make sure I don't die as well.

1159
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,360
And I'm just the trophy wife.

1160
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,340
And I'm just the trophy wife.

1161
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,460
I'm the trophy wife.

1162
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:32,720
Yeah.

1163
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,380
Gumi will save me.

1164
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,160
Cause all the other Minecraft players would be like...

1165
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,700
Oh my god.

1166
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,620
Gumi you're a friend.

1167
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,200
So we won't kill you.

1168
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,660
And then they'll see me next to Gumi.

1169
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,340
And they'll be like...

1170
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,820
Oh my god you're Gumi's wife.

1171
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,980
We won't kill you.

1172
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:52,980
And I'm like oh thank god.

1173
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,540
Thank god.

1174
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,260
Protection by association.

1175
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,420
I'm gonna get protection here.

1176
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,400
Alright.

1177
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,780
Yay.

1178
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,820
Should we be at the starting line?

1179
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,640
Come on Gumi.

1180
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,200
Gumi come on.

1181
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,600
Gumi.

1182
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,440
Come on.

1183
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:18,740
Gumi.

1184
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,920
There's 40 seconds left.

1185
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,380
They're gonna have a head start Gumi.

1186
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,300
Oh no.

1187
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,120
Come on Gumi.

1188
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,320
I need the bodyguide protection.

1189
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,500
Come on.

1190
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,980
What are you doing just standing there?

1191
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,700
I don't know if they're gonna TPS or not.

1192
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,760
Oh no.

1193
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,280
I don't know if they'll TPS.

1194
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,300
I don't know if I should find her again.

1195
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,620
What if I need to find her again?

1196
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,420
What if I need to find her again?

1197
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,640
What if I need to find her again?

1198
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,940
Oh like what's the word?

1199
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,260
It's so creepy when there's literally no sound.

1200
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,380
You know?

1201
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,920
There's like no sound at all.

1202
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,260
And it's so fucking creepy.

1203
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,970
Oh it's another cutscene.

1204
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,490
Let's fucking go.

1205
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,730
We are news reporters.

1206
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,110
That's it.

1207
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,710
You should now understand that the legend is true.

1208
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,890
150 news reporters.

1209
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,130
And now it is you that will be tested.

1210
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,690
Representing BBC News.

1211
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:32,170
Our wicked conjurer has put forth a series of challenging nightmares.

1212
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,810
Each of which has spelled the end for a certain number of you.

1213
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,150
No I should be PBS Kids.

1214
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,110
Should you fail.

1215
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,690
Representing PBS Kids.

1216
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,450
Your soul will remain in the house of nightmares forever.

1217
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,970
Look kids need to have news reporters as well.

1218
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,990
And your life depends on your ability to succeed in them.

1219
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:54,810
Lights out.

1220
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,950
The first nightmare is called lights out.

1221
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:02,230
To survive you must traverse a long path to the safe zone.

1222
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,950
As you progress the lights will turn off and on randomly.

1223
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:11,730
When the lights turn off the spirits can see you moving.

1224
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,850
So you must stay complete.

1225
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,210
That's why you have to stay still.

1226
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,090
You can resume movement once the lights come on.

1227
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:18,630
And come back on.

1228
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,500
That's spooky.

1229
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,540
You can find ability boxes scattered around the environment.

1230
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,080
What do the boxes look like?

1231
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,760
Purple ability boxes will give you an advantage over other players.

1232
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,340
The abilities could be a three second speed boost potion.

1233
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,920
Oh it is like Mario Kart.

1234
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,380
Or a snowball that can freeze an opponent you hit for three seconds.

1235
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,460
It is basically like Mario Kart.

1236
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,700
If you move while the lights are out.

1237
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,900
You will find yourself haunted by the spirits.

1238
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,760
And momentarily unable to move.

1239
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,440
At least you don't die.

1240
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,820
A timer will count down until you can move again.

1241
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,900
This is a race to the safe zone.

1242
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,120
Only 140 of you will pass.

1243
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,300
This means that 10 of you will meet your final ending here today.

1244
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,580
Oh wait!

1245
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,060
That means two people will get eliminated!

1246
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:17,880
Oh okay now.

1247
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,540
I don't want to jinx myself.

1248
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,800
But like if I can get out of here.

1249
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,400
If I am one of the two people that get eliminated.

1250
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,060
I am just never playing Minecraft again.

1251
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:33,920
If I am literally one of the two people that get eliminated.

1252
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,280
I will be so fucking sad.

1253
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,940
There is 142 people.

1254
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,090
And I will be so depressed.

1255
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,060
If I get eliminated.

1256
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,580
I will be so fucking sad.

1257
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,200
Please don't let me be the two.

1258
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,640
Don't let me be one of the two.

1259
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,200
That's all I want.

1260
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,580
I will actually uninstall this game.

1261
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,560
I became one of them.

1262
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,280
Oh my god.

1263
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,480
Okay.

1264
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,760
30 seconds.

1265
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,820
Oh my god.

1266
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,800
They know.

1267
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,700
They enabled voice chat again.

1268
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,680
And then they disabled voice chat.

1269
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,960
I like how they enabled voice chat.

1270
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,260
Guys!

1271
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,160
Okay.

1272
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,780
Okay I don't like that.

1273
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,460
I don't like that.

1274
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,740
They should have not enabled voice chat there.

1275
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,700
They should have not enabled voice chat there.

1276
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,000
When we are all pipes down together.

1277
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,120
Okay.

1278
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,200
Oh my.

1279
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,760
I can barely see the fucking light.

1280
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,260
Oh!

1281
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,440
Oh!

1282
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,540
Oh!

1283
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,600
Oh!

1284
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,340
Oh my god.

1285
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:00,960
Okay.

1286
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,940
I can't see the fucking light!

1287
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,980
This is terrifying.

1288
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,680
Follow the crowd!

1289
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,920
Follow the crowd!

1290
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,500
This is terrifying.

1291
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,480
Follow the crowd!

1292
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,200
They will leave me.

1293
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,120
They will leave me.

1294
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,660
See you later nerds.

1295
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,500
I do hear Fulham.

1296
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,000
See you later.

1297
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:22,860
I won't be there.

1298
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,960
Fulham I love you.

1299
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:25,720
Oh.

1300
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,300
Okay.

1301
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,200
That's fine.

1302
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,960
Slowly passing by the people that got knocked out.

1303
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,260
Get fucked.

1304
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,720
Get fucked.

1305
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:37,240
Get fucked.

1306
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,060
Oh.

1307
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:38,980
Okay.

1308
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,260
Oh.

1309
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:42,920
No.

1310
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,400
No.

1311
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,220
Don't talk please.

1312
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,160
I'm already overwhelmed.

1313
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,160
I'm already overwhelmed.

1314
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,560
Don't talk guys.

1315
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,740
Don't talk.

1316
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:54,880
Oh.

1317
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,620
Oh.

1318
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,000
This is so scary.

1319
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,660
Oh my god.

1320
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,520
This is so scary.

1321
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,740
Please.

1322
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,100
I can't see anything.

1323
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,360
Move away from me.

1324
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,880
Move away from me.

1325
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,820
I can barely.

1326
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,460
Oh god.

1327
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,940
Oh god.

1328
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,440
Move.

1329
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,960
I can't see anything.

1330
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,500
I can barely see anything.

1331
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,700
Oh my god.

1332
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,340
Oh my god.

1333
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,260
I need to like get away from everybody.

1334
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,320
I need to make sure I'm not bunched up with people.

1335
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:25,620
No.

1336
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,460
Because I really can't see anything.

1337
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,600
Okay.

1338
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:30,920
Nice.

1339
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,420
Yeah.

1340
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,400
Get fucked loser.

1341
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,160
I mean get hacked loser.

1342
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,680
Okay.

1343
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,140
Okay.

1344
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,760
There's no way we can be the bottom two.

1345
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,020
We didn't get frozen once guys.

1346
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,040
There's no way.

1347
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,800
There's... Oh.

1348
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:52,660
No.

1349
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,320
No.

1350
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:53,480
No.

1351
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,300
We're like almost in the front.

1352
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,260
How are they faster?

1353
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,140
I don't understand.

1354
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,220
How are they so fast?

1355
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,220
The people in the front.

1356
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,580
Like I'm...

1357
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,700
We're moving the same speed.

1358
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:09,900
We're...

1359
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,200
We're literally the same speed.

1360
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,900
Is there like a bunny hop tech?

1361
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,480
Guys I can't even ask you guys if you know what the bunny hop tech is.

1362
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,700
What's the bunny hop?

1363
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,500
What's the bunny hop tech?

1364
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,540
These goddamn minecraft players.

1365
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,460
These goddamn minecraft players and their bee hop tech.

1366
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,080
Jesus Christ.

1367
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,480
Oh there's a little short cut here.

1368
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,500
Don't go that way.

1369
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,920
Don't go that way.

1370
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,980
What do you mean don't go that way?

1371
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,580
Where do you go?

1372
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,740
Where do you go though?

1373
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,980
Oh my gosh.

1374
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,760
Okay, okay, okay.

1375
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,560
Follow the crowd!

1376
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,480
Follow the crowd!

1377
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,240
Follow the crowd!

1378
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,540
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1379
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,340
Oh my gosh.

1380
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,220
Still surviving!

1381
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,020
Still surviving!

1382
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,800
I'm just like the Minecraft players!

1383
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,420
I'm just like them!

1384
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,720
I'm going.

1385
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,960
Oh my gosh.

1386
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,360
I just left it up.

1387
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,920
Okay, here we go.

1388
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,860
Oh my gosh, guys.

1389
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,500
Maybe I should be a Minecraft player.

1390
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,920
Okay, here we go.

1391
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,240
I almost thought I got hit.

1392
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,700
I almost thought I got hit.

1393
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:27,940
Okay.

1394
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:30,880
Nice.

1395
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,980
Nice, we passed by people.

1396
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,200
We just passed.

1397
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,620
Yeah, that's what you get for getting too cocky, man!

1398
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,440
I can't see.

1399
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,480
I can't see.

1400
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,300
I can't see.

1401
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,320
I can't see.

1402
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:41,580
I can't see.

1403
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,700
I can't see.

1404
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,500
It's just names.

1405
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,300
Whoa.

1406
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,020
It's just names.

1407
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,240
Oh my gosh.

1408
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:50,960
So much.

1409
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,900
I can't...

1410
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:53,560
Wait.

1411
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,900
I got blocked by 200 people.

1412
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,020
I got blocked by 200 people there.

1413
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,660
Oh, God.

1414
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,680
Please, please.

1415
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,260
Don't mic spam.

1416
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,580
Please.

1417
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,980
I beg of you.

1418
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,480
I'm not gonna be good at this.

1419
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,300
I can take control.

1420
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,260
Oh, God.

1421
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:12,620
Okay.

1422
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,520
Okay.

1423
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,600
We're okay.

1424
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:14,980
We're okay.

1425
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,480
Hey, guys.

1426
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,180
Just two seconds.

1427
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,560
No, no, no.

1428
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,720
What are you talking about?

1429
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,320
Where is the safe zone?

1430
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,700
How is it that far?

1431
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,280
Fuck.

1432
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,060
Okay.

1433
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,220
There's still so much more that go.

1434
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,360
I could barely, like, take in the surrounding.

1435
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,920
Because it's just people.

1436
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,320
All of them.

1437
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,260
Oh, my God.

1438
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,460
All I see are people.

1439
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,240
Oh, my God.

1440
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,820
All I see are people.

1441
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,900
Oh, my God.

1442
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,580
Oh, my God.

1443
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,060
Oh, my God.

1444
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,040
Oh, my God.

1445
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,160
Nice.

1446
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,360
We're almost there.

1447
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,760
We're almost there.

1448
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:57,980
Oh.

1449
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:58,160
Oh.

1450
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,680
Please.

1451
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,420
Please, don't.

1452
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,020
Oh.

1453
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,520
Nice.

1454
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:01,960
Nice.

1455
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,180
Nice.

1456
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,420
I actually don't even know we're almost there.

1457
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,300
I just feel like I've been running forever, chat.

1458
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,540
I've been running for so long.

1459
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,240
There's no way!

1460
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,220
Nobody's at the safe zone, not even the front of the pack!

1461
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,700
I think this is the first 50%.

1462
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,320
Nobody's at the safe zone yet!

1463
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,460
Please.

1464
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,740
Please somebody hit the safe zone.

1465
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,080
Please, I beg of you.

1466
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,360
Somebody please!

1467
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,320
So I know if the end is near!

1468
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,180
That's all I want!

1469
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,320
Is the end near yet?!

1470
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,320
Oh my god.

1471
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,580
Is there still people?!

1472
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,300
Okay, I'm back.

1473
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,380
Oh my god, there's still more!

1474
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,600
How the hell is there still more?!

1475
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,460
Alright.

1476
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,520
Nice.

1477
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,800
All I'm saying is I haven't been hit once yet.

1478
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,640
I haven't been hit by the ghost yet, guys.

1479
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,140
I'm practically gaming.

1480
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,280
Get shit on.

1481
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,760
Look at all these people sitting down.

1482
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,100
Hehehehe.

1483
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,040
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

1484
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,440
That's the only thing I could hear.

1485
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,060
Oh my god, they're so in the front.

1486
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,140
Oh.

1487
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:43,880
Oh.

1488
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,700
I don't understand how the moving thing actually hits though.

1489
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,020
I feel like I should have been hit several times.

1490
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,440
Oh god.

1491
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:56,380
I like how nobody's getting the box.

1492
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,800
Or like the box.

1493
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,480
Only the front people can get the box right now.

1494
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,200
So like I have not been hit once.

1495
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,920
I have not hit the box once.

1496
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,280
Lucky you.

1497
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,520
We're in last place right now.

1498
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:07,940
Where are we?

1499
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,120
Okay.

1500
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,080
We have to be in the middle of the pack.

1501
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:13,560
Yes!

1502
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:14,720
That's how it is!

1503
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,720
Are you serious?

1504
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,040
Oh, okay.

1505
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,280
I'm too scared.

1506
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,060
Too scared.

1507
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,320
Oh my god.

1508
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:22,940
Now I know why.

1509
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,940
Now I know why they're in the front.

1510
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,840
Yes!

1511
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,100
I'm speeding now!

1512
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,600
Okay, I'm speeding but yet she's still in the front.

1513
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,980
Like what is this fucking bullshit?

1514
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:43,760
I'm speeding yet I'm still not fasting.

1515
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,920
Okay, I got snowballed.

1516
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,740
Oh my god, I got snowballed.

1517
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,480
Did I hit the box?

1518
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,220
No, I missed!

1519
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,760
Okay, okay.

1520
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,200
It's all done now.

1521
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,580
What is the freaking...

1522
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,480
I'm so sorry.

1523
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,980
How do you...

1524
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,180
You slowed me.

1525
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,400
I have a crunch against you.

1526
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:09,560
It wasn't me.

1527
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:09,900
It wasn't me.

1528
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:10,660
It didn't do anything.

1529
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,460
It flew like...

1530
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,240
I slowed you.

1531
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,640
Oh, I see.

1532
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,820
I'm the one who gave that away.

1533
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,760
I'm not in this.

1534
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:17,620
Okay.

1535
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,420
Okay, they hit it though.

1536
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,900
It's where you are.

1537
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:20,700
No.

1538
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:21,620
Please.

1539
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,560
Oh my god.

1540
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,060
Please.

1541
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,820
How is there still more?

1542
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,380
You do it first.

1543
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,360
You do it first.

1544
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,340
Oh no.

1545
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,980
Is there still more of this map?

1546
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,840
I don't... I feel like I've been running for like 10 years.

1547
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,260
I don't understand.

1548
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,360
No one's at the safe zone.

1549
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,560
We got this.

1550
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,120
We got this.

1551
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:51,700
We can do this.

1552
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,700
Don't let them know.

1553
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,200
Oh, my god.

1554
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,820
I got frozen.

1555
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,220
Is this the safe zone?

1556
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,220
No, it's not.

1557
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,520
I need to be euthanized.

1558
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,080
What the fuck?

1559
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,200
Did you just hear that?

1560
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,040
Someone said you need to be euthanized.

1561
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:07,640
Oh, my god.

1562
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:07,900
I'm shaking.

1563
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:08,560
Oh, my god.

1564
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,240
My freaking heart.

1565
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,120
Oh, my god.

1566
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,540
I'm shaking too, but it's because of the coffee.

1567
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,280
What?

1568
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:12,640
Just be euthanized.

1569
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,140
A little bit of a f**k them.

1570
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,900
Oh, I'm being so anxious.

1571
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,020
I'm being so anxious.

1572
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,680
I'm just trying to exist.

1573
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,380
I'm not a gamer.

1574
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:19,400
I'm not a gamer.

1575
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,680
I'm just trying to exist.

1576
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,780
I have no idea.

1577
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,560
I haven't been hit once.

1578
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,660
I haven't been hit once.

1579
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,520
There's no way.

1580
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,820
You're in my face, HTC!

1581
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,700
You're in my face, HTC!

1582
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,180
I have no idea.

1583
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,200
I have no idea.

1584
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,720
I have no idea left or right.

1585
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,580
I have no idea left or right.

1586
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,060
I'm gonna go left.

1587
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,500
Oh, gosh, Vic, where you going?

1588
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,860
Okay, I'm going left.

1589
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,340
I'm going left.

1590
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:47,940
I'm going left.

1591
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,920
I trust left side.

1592
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,460
Left side seems like they know what they're doing.

1593
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,360
I trust the left.

1594
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,340
That's a bad connotation, Fla.

1595
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,980
Oh, please, guys.

1596
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,040
Please, some of you turn into like bad connotations.

1597
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,620
This is...

1598
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,880
If it's not left, we're so fucked.

1599
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,400
I don't even know what the fuck.

1600
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,000
No, left or right.

1601
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,340
I hate making decisions.

1602
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,240
I want that.

1603
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:12,640
I want that.

1604
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:14,940
Okay.

1605
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,440
Wait, I didn't even get that?

1606
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,640
Who the heck got it?

1607
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:18,920
I'm scared.

1608
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,560
I'm so sad.

1609
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,040
I'm so sad.

1610
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,440
I got pinged so hard.

1611
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,560
Where is the server?

1612
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,900
The server is not on West Coast.

1613
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,680
I got pinged so hard.

1614
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,860
I hit somebody!

1615
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,160
Okay, nice.

1616
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,300
Alright.

1617
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,600
This is not fair.

1618
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,840
This is a ping diff.

1619
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,480
The ping diff is messing me over.

1620
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:39,920
Goodbye.

1621
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:40,820
Goodbye.

1622
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,040
Oh.

1623
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,140
I messed up.

1624
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,660
I messed up.

1625
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:45,660
Please.

1626
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:51,680
The moment I see people leading into the safe zone, I know the moment.

1627
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,680
The moment I know it's almost over.

1628
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,480
The moment I know it's almost over.

1629
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,780
How are you?

1630
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,840
It's still, it's still going.

1631
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,420
This is a mile run.

1632
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,460
It's literally the mile run.

1633
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,980
It's literally the mile run.

1634
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,260
It was out of panic.

1635
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,240
Hi, Lexi.

1636
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:13,860
We're still okay.

1637
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,480
We're still okay.

1638
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,080
Lexi Murphy, what's happening?

1639
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,800
Okay, not gonna lie, we should eliminate more than 10 people.

1640
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,440
Guys, are we in the bottom 10, be honest?

1641
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:28,860
This should have been like 20, at least 30 people.

1642
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,480
Oh god, I thought that was a ghost.

1643
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,540
That's just Tubbo.

1644
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,540
That's just Tubbo.

1645
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,280
Cuidado, Tubbo.

1646
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,260
Okay.

1647
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,200
Come on, come on, please.

1648
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,680
No, that's not Tubbo.

1649
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,880
Are we done yet?

1650
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,320
We're just journalists.

1651
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,360
We're not supposed to be running.

1652
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,380
What the fuck?

1653
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,480
How much more of this do we have to do?

1654
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,060
Well, there's a box that's not for me, I guess.

1655
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,920
Don't get near the person with the box.

1656
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,860
Don't freeze me, don't freeze me, I'm just a girl.

1657
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:14,360
Alright.

1658
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,240
There's no way.

1659
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,020
We must be top this time.

1660
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,000
There's no way.

1661
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,200
There's no way.

1662
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,420
I didn't get stopped once.

1663
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,260
Come on, bro.

1664
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,040
We can do this, we can do this, we can do this, we can do this.

1665
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,460
I'm dead, I'm dying.

1666
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:37,920
I feel like, I feel like I've seen this place like 20 times.

1667
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,020
I'm actually gonna poop my pants.

1668
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,440
I feel like I've looked at the same hallway.

1669
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:48,220
What a right combo.

1670
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,620
No, not me, wait for me.

1671
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,280
Don't freeze me.

1672
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,120
It's in your pants.

1673
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,020
What's up, bitch?

1674
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,060
Hey, Flex.

1675
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,900
Someone, please, chop this mansion in half, please.

1676
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,260
Do we want to like, all the way in the front?

1677
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:02,740
Yeah, that's crazy.

1678
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:03,240
Dude, I think I'm gonna make it.

1679
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:07,960
Chop this mansion in half for the love of God.

1680
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,100
Flex, Flex.

1681
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,140
There's so no one safe.

1682
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,300
Get me, get me, you...

1683
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,020
Okay, okay.

1684
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:13,960
Get me.

1685
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,180
But no.

1686
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,140
That competition isn't between us.

1687
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,280
No one is fucking safe!

1688
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,060
What the heck?

1689
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,920
If nobody in the front is safe, that means there's so much...

1690
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,980
There's so much more!

1691
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,720
There's so much more ahead of me!

1692
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,100
We got this!

1693
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,880
Are you okay?

1694
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:43,940
Everything's fine.

1695
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:44,620
Everything's fine.

1696
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,440
Everything's fine.

1697
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,600
I'm getting distracted by the English!

1698
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,500
My foot is just...

1699
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,320
Oh god.

1700
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,240
This is it.

1701
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,440
Please.

1702
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,600
Please.

1703
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,280
Somebody.

1704
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:01,480
I got trapped, dude.

1705
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,500
Hey Jack!

1706
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,880
Your back's shaking!

1707
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,300
You're gonna go crazy!

1708
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,300
I'm actually gonna go crazy.

1709
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,420
How come we're not done yet?

1710
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:13,920
How come we're not done yet?

1711
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,060
Bye bye.

1712
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,700
Bye bye, Zerbiosh!

1713
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:16,880
That's all I want!

1714
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:18,800
Bye bye!

1715
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:19,320
Leave me out!

1716
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:20,620
No, no, no.

1717
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,060
Be sure!

1718
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,100
You got out.

1719
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,480
Thank you for the false hope.

1720
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,320
I appreciate it regardless.

1721
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,560
Let me finish this race!

1722
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,400
Wait, did I get haunted?

1723
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,480
Was that hot?

1724
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:37,820
Who's that?

1725
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,120
No, that wasn't...

1726
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,440
Oh my god.

1727
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,640
Someone just fucking showed up in front of me.

1728
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,860
I was like, who the fuck is that?

1729
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,100
Fuck.

1730
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:43,640
I'm just a girl!

1731
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:44,800
I'm just a beautiful...

1732
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:44,980
Okay.

1733
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,000
Oh, nice, we're okay.

1734
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,380
We're still okay.

1735
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,800
I'm so far behind!

1736
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,520
You're not far behind!

1737
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,220
We haven't been stopped once!

1738
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,320
There's no way we're behind!

1739
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,880
There's no way we're one of the two that gets eliminated.

1740
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:09,340
Guys, I didn't realize how big this mansion really is, guys.

1741
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,200
Like, I'm already...

1742
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,720
My energy is gone already.

1743
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:41,880
I'm scared.

1744
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,400
Or we could go for like a Hail Mary, throw it like...

1745
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,600
Oh my god, there's a checkpoint?!

1746
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,520
What the fuck does a checkpoint mean?!

1747
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,000
Oh my god!

1748
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,260
What the fuck does a checkpoint mean?!

1749
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,280
One of ten checkpoints.

1750
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,900
Like, what do you mean checkpoint?

1751
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,680
Oh, I don't know.

1752
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,380
There's no fucking way.

1753
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,580
He's doing more!

1754
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,400
Oh shit, nice!

1755
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,980
I can't believe it.

1756
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,960
I can't believe it.

1757
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,380
Why would you fall off?

1758
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,180
It's a bridge!

1759
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,720
How can you fall off from this?

1760
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,520
Oh god, okay, now I'm scared.

1761
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,900
Okay, now I'm scared a little bit.

1762
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,480
Because I said that.

1763
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,320
Alright.

1764
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:40,720
I'm scared.

1765
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,180
I'm scared.

1766
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,040
The moment I see one of 140, I know it's fucking over.

1767
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,380
I'll be free.

1768
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,020
The moment...

1769
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,840
The moment I see one out of 140...

1770
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,120
I know.

1771
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,260
Freedom is so close.

1772
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,060
Freedom will be there.

1773
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,460
Oh my god, Vida, thank you for the raid!

1774
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:03,960
Thank you!

1775
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,060
We're doing a Minecraft Witch Rivals, but I'm already so...

1776
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,180
My mental is already...

1777
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:11,700
I'm already so over.

1778
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:21,140
I've been running this course, I feel like, for like 15 minutes straight right now.

1779
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,020
We have to put out emo-only mode.

1780
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,380
Because they're worried that people are gonna ghost.

1781
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,920
Because there's 150 players.

1782
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,060
And first prize is like $70,000.

1783
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,300
So we have to have emo-only mode.

1784
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,720
But right now...

1785
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,400
Oh shit, nice!

1786
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,680
Oh my god, fuck you.

1787
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,180
You missed your shot!

1788
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,180
He's in front of me!

1789
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,720
How do you...

1790
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,940
How do I miss something point blank...

1791
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,680
Twice!

1792
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,640
It landed!

1793
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,380
There's no fucking way.

1794
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,840
There's no fucking way I missed twice.

1795
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,200
Okay.

1796
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,640
Oh my god, nice.

1797
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,000
Two out of 100 checkpoints.

1798
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,100
Nice.

1799
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,720
Two out of 100.

1800
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,800
We're doing it, guys.

1801
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:11,180
Alright.

1802
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,380
Here we go.

1803
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,120
Please.

1804
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,220
Someone, please.

1805
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,100
Someone, please.

1806
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,560
Take me out of this misery.

1807
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,140
Take me out of this misery.

1808
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:24,260
VAR!

1809
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,460
Can we get some VAR on that?

1810
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:25,940
Alright.

1811
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,180
Here we go.

1812
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,740
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

1813
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:29,920
Where are we?

1814
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,600
I wish there was a map!

1815
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:37,780
Like, there's so many things in this Minecraft thing, but we don't have a map.

1816
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,640
That's the only...

1817
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,160
The only thing we're missing is a goddamn map!

1818
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,560
So I know how far we have left.

1819
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,880
That's all I want.

1820
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:49,380
That's all I want.

1821
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,640
There should be players left.

1822
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,660
Wouldn't it be funny?

1823
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,280
I've been like, open mic this entire time.

1824
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:54,760
There's no way.

1825
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,780
I purposely made sure I was pushed to talk.

1826
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,140
It would be so funny.

1827
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:03,220
I've been like, annoying like, 140 people with me ranting about this game.

1828
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,780
I thought I was about to.

1829
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,280
There's no way.

1830
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,040
There's no way.

1831
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:11,520
There's no way.

1832
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,400
Nobody could hear my cries of pain except for you guys.

1833
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,180
Oh god.

1834
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:19,840
We're so close.

1835
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,720
I said that 10 minutes ago.

1836
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,580
But we're so close, guys.

1837
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,320
We're so close, guys.

1838
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,060
I swear.

1839
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,000
We're so close.

1840
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,440
We're so close.

1841
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,920
I got the speed.

1842
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,780
I got the speed.

1843
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,220
But yet for some reason, she's still faster than me.

1844
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,480
Oh!

1845
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,260
Oh my god!

1846
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,680
There's hope!

1847
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,760
Guys!

1848
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,180
Oh my god!

1849
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,860
How far ahead is this man?

1850
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:00,400
Bro, this guy is first place and nobody else has made it yet.

1851
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,180
Oh my god.

1852
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:05,580
Oh my god.

1853
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,100
There's hope!

1854
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,160
There's hope!

1855
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,420
We're so close!

1856
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,060
There's hope!

1857
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:11,980
I

1858
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,700
like how everybody who's made it are just Minecraft players.

1859
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,640
Guys, that 70k is going to a Minecraft player, guys.

1860
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,100
70k is not going to a regular player like me.

1861
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,260
70k is not going to a regular player like me.

1862
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:29,680
We did it!

1863
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,060
We did it!

1864
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:30,380
We did it!

1865
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,340
Oh my god.

1866
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,800
We're so close.

1867
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,580
We're almost there.

1868
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,040
Oh!

1869
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,580
It's going so fast!

1870
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:44,440
Guys, I'm scared now.

1871
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,600
It's going so fast.

1872
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:48,840
It's going so fast.

1873
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,980
it's going so fast, guys.

1874
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,240
Guys!

1875
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,720
Oh, god!

1876
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,580
There's no way!

1877
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,500
Guys, I'm scared.

1878
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,800
I'm actually scared now.

1879
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,160
Oh, wait!

1880
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,380
Oh, wait!

1881
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,180
It's right there, bro.

1882
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,220
We got this.

1883
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,580
Oh my god, is that it?

1884
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,060
Oh my god.

1885
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,240
I didn't realize how far back I was.

1886
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,240
Oh, please.

1887
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,120
We're so close.

1888
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,140
Oh my god.

1889
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,740
Please!

1890
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,340
Oh!

1891
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:29,060
I did it!

1892
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,160
Oh, thank god!

1893
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,380
I thought I was out of the start!

1894
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,240
Oh, thank fucking god!

1895
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,820
Oh, thank fucking god!

1896
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,360
Oh, thank fucking god!

1897
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:43,640
Oh, thank fucking god!

1898
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:45,420
How?

1899
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:46,100
How?

1900
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,180
I muted everybody!

1901
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,860
Oh, thank god!

1902
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:50,260
Please.

1903
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,920
Oh, god.

1904
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:55,560
Thank god.

1905
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:58,740
Alright.

1906
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,720
Un-emote mode, guys.

1907
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:01,380
We did it.

1908
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,600
Is my mod still around?

1909
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,860
Un-emote mode.

1910
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,300
How do I un-emote mode?

1911
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,800
You can remove emote mode now.

1912
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,720
How was I 97?

1913
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:14,780
How was I 97?

1914
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,480
How was I 97?

1915
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,540
I thought I was doing pretty well.

1916
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,260
I didn't get stopped at all.

1917
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,460
How the fuck was I 97?

1918
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:25,920
97!

1919
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,160
I swear to... okay, at least guys, I don't have to uninstall this game.

1920
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,920
I'm not one of the two people.

1921
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:38,360
Oh... I'm not one... one of the two people that got eliminated.

1922
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:42,660
Just so you guys know, two people will be eliminated in this game.

1923
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:48,720
And I said I would never play Minecraft again if I was that unfortunate.

1924
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,820
Oh my god.

1925
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,600
I'm happy.

1926
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,620
I'm so happy.

1927
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,760
Jesus Christ.

1928
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,440
I hope you guys could hear me with all the people talking.

1929
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,100
I couldn't even tell you guys could hear me.

1930
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:07,980
There was just too much dialogue.

1931
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,800
Too many people were talking.

1932
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,400
Oh my god.

1933
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:16,220
I... like... oh no, I'm stuck.

1934
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,660
I was like so overwhelmed.

1935
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,700
I came in here...

1936
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,660
Lots of energy... lots of energy prepared for this event.

1937
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,640
150 people started talking and now I'm out.

1938
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,960
All that energy gone.

1939
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,520
Oh my god.

1940
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,080
Alright, who's gonna be eliminated anyway?

1941
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,520
I wonder who's gonna make it.

1942
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,040
The batter... yeah, Gumi apparently made it.

1943
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,160
I saw someone said in chat.

1944
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,300
She made it.

1945
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,400
I don't see her though.

1946
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:53,080
I turned off the voice chat because it was just too much.

1947
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,540
Like 150 people in this room.

1948
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,940
Gumi was top 20!

1949
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,540
Okay, she's a Minecraft player though.

1950
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,500
She actually plays Minecraft.

1951
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,560
Like I'm not surprised.

1952
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,540
My best bet is I don't... cause the next game...

1953
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:13,140
The next game is... is... PvP.

1954
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,320
It's a 1v1.

1955
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,660
It's a 1v1.

1956
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,320
And like I'm so fucked if like I'm against an actual Minecraft player.

1957
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,080
It's like some goddamn PvP shit.

1958
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,440
Alright guys, also like I stopped caring about the swear rule.

1959
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,960
Like they're not gonna check this bot, right?

1960
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,120
As long as I'm not swearing in other people's streams.

1961
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,080
Like...

1962
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,780
Guys, we all know I'm not gonna make it to fucking top 20.

1963
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,160
Guys, I'm here for the content.

1964
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,760
Yeah, 150 people and I'm the only one swearing.

1965
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,940
Like I call that bullshit.

1966
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,940
Like I believe the Minecraft players wouldn't...

1967
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,800
The Minecraft players will follow the rules.

1968
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,520
Like will follow the rules.

1969
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,000
But the non Minecraft players like me would definitely not be following.

1970
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,480
Oh wait, one more person.

1971
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,820
Oh, okay.

1972
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,040
Yay, we did it!

1973
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,480
140 players!

1974
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:18,820
Oh.

1975
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,080
No, Tiffany.

1976
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,820
Whoever you are.

1977
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,560
No, Leifason.

1978
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,120
Whoever you are.

1979
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,220
I don't know who you are.

1980
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,100
No, Sofitty.

1981
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:33,600
Rest in peace.

1982
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,760
I don't know who you are.

1983
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:36,860
But...

1984
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,080
Oh no, wait, that's a VTuber!

1985
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,540
Oh no!

1986
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:42,960
Project...

1987
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,200
Oh, is that Project Melody?

1988
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,380
No!

1989
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,280
Melody!

1990
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,380
Oh no!

1991
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,560
Don't worry.

1992
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,940
I'll carry on the banner.

1993
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,240
The VTuber banner.

1994
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,640
Rosadoodle.

1995
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,200
I think Rosadoodle is still in too.

1996
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,040
Don't worry.

1997
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,300
We'll get eliminated the next game instead.

1998
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:13,170
Oh.

1999
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:16,870
Oh, okay.

2000
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:17,810
Now I can...

2001
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:18,810
I should be able to...

2002
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:20,870
Blink in.

2003
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,450
I have to wait.

2004
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:28,010
Oh my god, we woke up.

2005
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,210
I just woke up from my nightmare.

2006
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,770
Look at how fun.

2007
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:32,730
People I know.

2008
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:36,350
You're top five on the Minecraft category.

2009
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:37,490
Oh god.

2010
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:39,670
Oh god.

2011
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,950
Please, I don't...

2012
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,810
Don't have zero expectations.

2013
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:45,350
Please.

2014
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:46,630
Please.

2015
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:46,850
Please.

2016
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:49,130
Please have zero expectations on me.

2017
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:49,570
I'm not...

2018
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:51,570
I'm not like your other Minecraft players.

2019
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:53,030
I don't know what I'm doing.

2020
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,910
I was 97th in the race, guys.

2021
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:00,750
Oh no.

2022
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:03,150
No, then these children are watching!

2023
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:03,930
No!

2024
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:05,630
All right, kids.

2025
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:10,670
If you're watching me and you have Twitch Prime, don't worry.

2026
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:11,890
Your mom will have Twitch Prime.

2027
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,570
How did y'all go so fast?

2028
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:16,710
Oh no.

2029
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:16,810
I'm so sorry.

2030
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:18,250
Oh no, I can't believe it.

2031
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,310
The Minecraft kids are watching me now.

2032
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:24,350
Minecraft children, let me introduce you to better games.

2033
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:39,670
All right, for all those who are new here, I actually usually stream on YouTube, but because this is a Twitch Rivals tournament, that's why I'm the Twitch.

2034
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:43,870
But yeah, please check me out on YouTube if you enjoy this content.

2035
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,790
I barely could take a video.

2036
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:49,850
I'm just gonna stay in this entire mansion, because all I did was just run.

2037
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:52,350
You scratched my CD.

2038
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:52,990
Oh, sorry.

2039
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:54,770
What the fuck?

2040
01:21:58,450 --> 01:22:01,090
What the- what did I- okay.

2041
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:04,530
Okay.

2042
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:07,930
I don't know what's going on with that girl.

2043
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:11,010
My goodness.

2044
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:13,050
Oh, yes.

2045
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:16,650
No, I didn't get a chance to like...

2046
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:16,770
Shit.

2047
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:19,830
Actually, take in the mansion builds.

2048
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:22,350
Because I swear I was just like...

2049
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,510
I swear I was just like...

2050
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:25,210
in the...

2051
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:27,310
People were just like...

2052
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,770
People were just like...

2053
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,070
in my space.

2054
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:32,210
I couldn't even see what was going on.

2055
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,390
Espana?

2056
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:40,210
Yeah, there's like a lot of Spanish speaking streamers in this tournament too.

2057
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:42,350
Because Minecraft is really popular.

2058
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:43,810
Oh wait, that's her again.

2059
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,970
Every time I bump into her, she's eating.

2060
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:54,130
Oh yeah, no, I was frozen and the lights were off.

2061
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:58,230
I never got a chance to get haunted by the ghost.

2062
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,870
I still can't believe it.

2063
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,750
I never got haunted by a ghost.

2064
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,550
But yet... what the f...

2065
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:07,410
I never got haunted by the ghost.

2066
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:09,050
But I was still 97.

2067
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:10,610
Like, what is the tech?

2068
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,590
What the heck is the tech?

2069
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,050
I just...

2070
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,970
God, you go so fast!

2071
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:22,290
I just...

2072
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,630
You run?

2073
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:25,890
You run and hold space?

2074
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,410
Oh, you don't manually jump?

2075
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:30,010
You just let the jumping...

2076
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:31,590
Wait, is that it?

2077
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:35,710
You just... you hold space?

2078
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:38,710
Oh, I've been manually jumping, by the way.

2079
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:39,110
I've been...

2080
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:42,990
I've been manually pressing the jump.

2081
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:46,750
That's how you do it.

2082
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:47,630
You do the bunny hop!

2083
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:48,530
I...

2084
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,070
Oh, um...

2085
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:52,930
I've just been like... I've been doing this.

2086
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:53,610
Oh, uh...

2087
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:55,410
Yeah,

2088
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:00,770
I didn't...

2089
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:01,510
Well, now I know!

2090
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,590
Now that I know, it's over.

2091
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:04,710
It's over.

2092
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:05,990
We're gonna be doing so well.

2093
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:07,350
Okay, look.

2094
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:10,530
People don't hold... hold buttons in FPS.

2095
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,630
Okay, that's a lie, because we need a right click.

2096
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:14,910
We hold the right click.

2097
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,750
But, like, not for...

2098
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:17,670
Not for jumping, okay?

2099
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:22,890
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but in, like, shooter games, we don't jump a lot.

2100
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:24,970
Because when you jump, you're more predictable.

2101
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,910
So, like, I didn't know the tech.

2102
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:28,650
Come on, come on.

2103
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:29,630
Come on, give me some more.

2104
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:31,970
Keep acting as if we've never been here.

2105
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:32,390
Oh, my God.

2106
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,670
You know when he said that OVO was, like, working for you?

2107
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:37,010
At least, like, not a lot of people got eliminated, though.

2108
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:37,410
Oh, my gosh.

2109
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:38,150
Oh, there's a little girl.

2110
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:38,910
Oh, my gosh.

2111
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:42,210
I just saw the mob of people, and I saw the mob of people go right.

2112
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,790
And I was like, okay.

2113
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:43,190
Uh-huh.

2114
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:44,170
I felt like I was...

2115
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,130
I wonder, like...

2116
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:49,030
I wonder if, like, right was faster than left, though.

2117
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:49,270
Leave it, leave it.

2118
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,230
I wonder.

2119
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,470
This is a long intermission.

2120
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,170
I can slow this with my stop-nap as well.

2121
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:58,410
Sit with the little girl.

2122
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,570
This is a very long intermission.

2123
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:01,950
Take us to the second game.

2124
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:02,910
Wait, I have an egg.

2125
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:04,670
It clearly shows that it was an accident.

2126
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:05,390
There was...

2127
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:07,990
I have an egg on my bottom right.

2128
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,090
What is that?

2129
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:13,270
Yeah, his eyes actually...

2130
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:13,690
Oh, my God.

2131
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,290
Where is Gumi?

2132
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:14,930
He's right behind me.

2133
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:16,850
Where is Gumi?

2134
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:21,770
Playing Apex Minecraft now.

2135
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,770
I mean, there's Roblox Apex.

2136
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:26,090
I don't know if you guys have ever seen it.

2137
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:31,430
I played, like, Overwatch Roblox just because I was curious.

2138
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,150
Guys, stream snipe for me.

2139
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:35,690
Where is Gumi?

2140
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:37,690
Wait, Doki!

2141
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:38,710
Hello!

2142
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:42,870
Would you want an alliance with me, Guapo, and E-Rob?

2143
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:44,610
It's a winning team, I swear.

2144
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:45,190
Are you sure?

2145
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:46,390
What if we get eliminated?

2146
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,410
How can we get eliminated?

2147
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:49,990
We have E-Rob.

2148
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:50,890
Oh, that...

2149
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:51,490
Wait, but...

2150
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:53,230
No, that's why we're gonna get eliminated.

2151
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:57,450
Don't listen to her, E-Rob.

2152
01:25:57,610 --> 01:25:58,370
Don't listen to her.

2153
01:25:58,450 --> 01:25:59,550
What do you mean by that?

2154
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:03,890
Don't listen to her, E-Rob.

2155
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:04,290
It's okay.

2156
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:04,930
He...

2157
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:05,550
You know, he...

2158
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:06,730
He didn't lose the last one.

2159
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,650
He made it before the seven people that got eliminated.

2160
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:10,990
Okay, what's the placement?

2161
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:12,010
What did E-Rob place?

2162
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:13,950
We don't have to talk about that.

2163
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:14,590
What did E-Rob place?

2164
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:14,990
E-Rob...

2165
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:15,830
What did you place, E-Rob?

2166
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:17,590
We don't have to talk about that.

2167
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:19,950
As long as you qualify...

2168
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:20,230
102.

2169
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:20,970
102?

2170
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:21,170
E -Rob?

2171
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:21,990
Mendo, what did you place?

2172
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:26,130
I was like ten behind you or like eight behind you or something, because I...

2173
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:27,690
Yeah, I had a booty.

2174
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:29,230
102 is not...

2175
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:30,370
Are you sure?

2176
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:31,190
Be nice.

2177
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:31,610
Be nice.

2178
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:35,350
So, are you joining us or nah?

2179
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:37,310
Okay.

2180
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,650
Okay.

2181
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:38,130
Sure.

2182
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,750
I'll join your alliance.

2183
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:42,670
Okay, so...

2184
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:43,850
Do you know the next game?

2185
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:44,570
Is like this.

2186
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:46,070
We did some 1v1 shit, right?

2187
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:47,750
Wait, Doki, what did you get?

2188
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:50,050
Definitely not 102.

2189
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,710
Okay, what did you get though?

2190
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:54,570
Because I didn't see you up front.

2191
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:56,090
I was top 100.

2192
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:57,630
Just so you know.

2193
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,750
Oh, but like, how top 100 were you?

2194
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:02,230
Look, top 100 counts.

2195
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:05,090
It's below EROP.

2196
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,530
Okay, so double digits.

2197
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:08,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2198
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:09,590
Double digits.

2199
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:10,730
That's all you need.

2200
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,310
It's a 2 view, not 3 view.

2201
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:14,150
Okay.

2202
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,590
So in a 1v1, do you beat EROP?

2203
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:16,970
Be honest.

2204
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,870
Yeah, I think so.

2205
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:22,090
Do you even play Minecraft?

2206
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:22,870
No, no, no.

2207
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,150
Doki knows how to play Overwatch.

2208
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,390
Doki is cracked.

2209
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,150
Okay, Overwatch isn't Minecraft.

2210
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:30,290
Yeah, but...

2211
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,330
You don't even play Minecraft!

2212
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,610
I've beaten the game on hardcore.

2213
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:38,130
That's great, EROP.

2214
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:40,430
That's good for you.

2215
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:41,370
I'm proud of you, man.

2216
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,610
That's so good.

2217
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:44,530
Have you?

2218
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:46,650
No, no.

2219
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:49,230
Bro, Minecraft's been out for like 20 plus years.

2220
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:50,990
You beat hardcore Minecraft.

2221
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,830
Yeah, I beat Minecraft hardcore.

2222
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,550
Like when I was like 13.

2223
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:58,470
Oh, man.

2224
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,130
Come on.

2225
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,890
We're a team, guys.

2226
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:02,510
We're a team.

2227
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:04,450
That laugh is so toxic.

2228
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:09,090
Hey, Steve with 8 out of 10 likes coming through.

2229
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:09,650
Watch out.

2230
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:10,910
8 out of 10?

2231
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:16,010
It took you three years on stream to beat Minecraft hardcore?

2232
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:19,250
No, it took me like two months.

2233
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,470
You could not force that out of me.

2234
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:25,990
You could not force that out of me.

2235
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:29,250
You could not force that out of me.

2236
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:31,410
I believe in this team.

2237
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,090
This next game is about lying.

2238
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:34,210
Oh.

2239
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:38,910
Everyone's muted.

2240
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:41,170
Maybe there's like eggs up here.

2241
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:43,370
Alright.

2242
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:44,870
Yeah.

2243
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:46,010
We'll win, right guys?

2244
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:46,730
Yeah.

2245
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,810
No.

2246
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:53,290
What's the 15 incident?

2247
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:54,890
What my chat are asking?

2248
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:55,710
Okay.

2249
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:59,530
After rivals, you can ask that.

2250
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,170
Oh, okay.

2251
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:01,530
Okay.

2252
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:02,630
Okay.

2253
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:06,810
Yeah, I believe.

2254
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:08,530
I believe in this team.

2255
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:10,810
Wait.

2256
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:11,150
So what?

2257
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:11,630
What is this?

2258
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,650
What is the second game?

2259
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:13,810
I didn't really understand it.

2260
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:14,730
I think I'll tell us.

2261
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,570
Yeah, we'll get a video that even EROB can understand.

2262
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:18,310
Oh, okay.

2263
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:18,730
Sweet.

2264
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:19,150
Nice.

2265
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,790
As long as he understands, our team will be solid.

2266
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:22,870
Yes.

2267
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:24,410
Did you read the rules though?

2268
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:25,850
It's in the daily itinerary.

2269
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:27,490
Yeah, I read the rules.

2270
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:28,930
I just didn't really understand the game.

2271
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:29,570
Yeah, I don't really understand.

2272
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,950
Yeah, I was just like, what?

2273
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:31,970
The lying thing?

2274
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,430
I think you get one of the three.

2275
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:35,530
So it's like rock, paper, scissors, but like, oh, I have rock.

2276
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:37,070
And I have to like lie or betray.

2277
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,970
Yeah, so it's just like Among Us or something.

2278
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:40,030
So it'd be like I...

2279
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:42,330
Yeah, it's kind of like playing Overwatch and only playing ball.

2280
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:43,770
And then if you get counterpicked, you complain.

2281
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:44,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2282
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:45,550
So it's your fault.

2283
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:48,750
I paid $40 to only know it's free to play now.

2284
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:51,030
I paid $40 for this Hammond skin.

2285
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:52,390
I should be allowed to play Hammond.

2286
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:53,490
Yeah.

2287
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,170
All right, guys.

2288
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:57,430
I believe in this team.

2289
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:57,950
Guys.

2290
01:29:58,270 --> 01:29:59,430
Guapo already picked his though.

2291
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:01,550
Guapo said he's Blade and he's refusing to swap.

2292
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,270
So like, I don't know.

2293
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:04,270
Yeah, I'm Blade, but there's only three.

2294
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:06,570
So we have to check these two rooms.

2295
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:07,150
I didn't see any.

2296
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:08,350
Yeah.

2297
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,470
Hi, Mendo.

2298
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:13,830
You made it two.

2299
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:14,770
I did.

2300
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:17,550
Okay.

2301
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,310
Do you want to guess what this game is?

2302
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:25,990
What number did you get?

2303
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:28,950
Because I know your chat is snitching on you.

2304
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,750
I said top 100.

2305
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:32,950
That's all that matters.

2306
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:34,190
You weren't lying, I guess.

2307
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,870
It is top 100.

2308
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,190
I think it was pretty close.

2309
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:39,670
What were you?

2310
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:42,250
I got like 20 or 30 or something.

2311
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,110
You can't say that.

2312
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:44,170
You got 102.

2313
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:48,010
Was that you at the finish line?

2314
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:49,790
I was sitting there.

2315
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:50,130
Yeah.

2316
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:50,810
Okay.

2317
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:52,830
Somebody was like, Sasha, you're going to make it.

2318
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:54,210
All right.

2319
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:55,010
That was me.

2320
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:59,530
I was yelling for E-Rob, but he actually Yeah.

2321
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:00,950
It's okay.

2322
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:05,890
As long as we're below E-Rob, that's all that matters.

2323
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:08,710
See, I was trying to grease people up front so I would have got like top 10.

2324
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,130
I was getting all the snowballs and stuff.

2325
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:17,130
I didn't get caught by the ghost at any point except for right in front of the finish line because I tried to get greedy.

2326
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,030
Top 100 is top 100.

2327
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:22,150
You can't take that from me.

2328
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:23,450
I got caught like three times.

2329
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:24,910
Dave, you made it.

2330
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:26,830
Let's go.

2331
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:28,450
I'm glad.

2332
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:29,390
I'm scared of the next game.

2333
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:30,550
Yeah, me too.

2334
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:32,150
I'm shaking in my boots.

2335
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:34,690
I don't want to lie.

2336
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:37,690
And I didn't know how to jump too.

2337
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:39,170
I think it's like rock, paper, scissors.

2338
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,770
Wait, let's go look for E-Strike.

2339
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:41,930
It's like rock, paper, scissors.

2340
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:44,490
I think it's like rock, paper, scissors.

2341
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:48,830
Hey guys, is Scooby playing fucking Pokemon right now?

2342
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,590
It's not rock, paper, scissors.

2343
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:53,230
It's not rock, paper, scissors.

2344
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:53,730
What do you mean?

2345
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:54,770
No!

2346
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:59,370
That's everything I relied on the intel that's in the game.

2347
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,710
It's like rock, paper, scissors, guys.

2348
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,970
If it's not like rock, paper, scissors, then what do I do?

2349
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:05,090
Is that one over here?

2350
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:08,370
What do I do if it's not like rock, paper, scissors?

2351
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:09,910
What do I do if it's not like rock, paper, scissors?

2352
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:13,090
Oh, she's at the Freddy's?

2353
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,030
Yeah, right over here.

2354
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:15,990
I'm heading over.

2355
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:18,930
I'm heading over.

2356
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:21,730
Where was the eighth one?

2357
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:22,070
What do you have?

2358
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:24,470
Let's see all the different Minecraft skins.

2359
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,510
Wait, this is not it.

2360
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:27,610
Yo-Yo.

2361
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:34,050
I feel like I wouldn't even understand the Easter eggs because I feel like it's going to be Minecraft related.

2362
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:36,190
And I'd be like, what the fuck is that?

2363
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:37,610
Sorry, the heck is that?

2364
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,830
It's the orange guy.

2365
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,970
Where is the finale?

2366
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:42,890
Oh, it's over here.

2367
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:46,370
I love looking at the...

2368
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:47,890
She moved to the bedrooms?

2369
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:49,770
Oh my god.

2370
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:52,350
I just wanted to say hi.

2371
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:52,530
I just wanted to say hi.

2372
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:57,170
I can't believe it.

2373
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:58,750
I have to do like this merry-go-round.

2374
01:32:59,010 --> 01:32:59,370
I can't believe it.

2375
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:00,730
The webcam.

2376
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:06,290
Which bedroom?

2377
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:07,790
There's like 20 bedrooms.

2378
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,950
Which one's the right bedroom?

2379
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,810
She's running down the...

2380
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:14,750
Oh my god.

2381
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:19,930
Oh my god.

2382
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:21,750
Where the heck is she?

2383
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,530
Where is she?

2384
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:28,530
I can't believe it.

2385
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:29,090
Guys, look at me.

2386
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:31,230
Can you tell I'm holding space jump now?

2387
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:35,030
Look, I would have been way ahead if I knew about the space...

2388
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:36,390
holding space tech.

2389
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:41,830
If I knew the holding space tech, I would have been first place.

2390
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:42,450
Easy.

2391
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,930
I was literally nerfed and still got top 500, guys.

2392
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:47,810
I...

2393
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,990
I was nerfed so hard.

2394
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:54,970
Wait, Gumi!

2395
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:56,170
There's two.

2396
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:57,830
Gumi!

2397
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:00,530
I saw you made it.

2398
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:01,790
I made it.

2399
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:02,770
I was so scared.

2400
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:04,130
I was so scared.

2401
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:06,190
I was like number 97.

2402
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:07,490
But I was top 100.

2403
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:10,830
I got 22nd.

2404
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:11,370
I was surprised.

2405
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:14,510
I didn't realize you're supposed to hold space bar.

2406
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,150
I was manually jumped.

2407
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:17,770
Do you know what?

2408
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:20,330
I thought that.

2409
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:21,090
I was like damn.

2410
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:24,710
She probably doesn't know how to sprint jump.

2411
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:25,270
Yeah.

2412
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:27,610
I was like how are they so fast?

2413
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,610
I'm doing the same thing as them.

2414
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:34,330
And then people were like you're supposed to hold space bar when you're jumping.

2415
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,870
It's great because I didn't get hit by the ghost too.

2416
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:42,530
I never got hit by the ghost but I was so far behind.

2417
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,450
I was so confused.

2418
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:45,230
I did.

2419
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:46,110
I got hit once.

2420
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,550
Are you looking for the Easter egg, Skokie?

2421
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:49,450
No, I'm just chilling.

2422
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:51,910
I was looking for Menda and Erob earlier.

2423
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:53,410
Oh really?

2424
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:55,590
Yeah, because they wanted to do an alliance.

2425
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:56,610
And stuff.

2426
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:59,470
They're saying this one is like a rock, paper, scissors.

2427
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,490
The next game.

2428
01:35:02,190 --> 01:35:04,570
And it's all about lying and stuff.

2429
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:06,310
Yeah.

2430
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:09,590
But what happens if you guys go against each other then, Wendoki?

2431
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:11,030
Then like...

2432
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,910
Then I guess the alliance is over.

2433
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:18,550
What happens if we go against each other, Gumi?

2434
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:19,090
Gumi?

2435
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,210
60-40.

2436
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:23,250
Like...

2437
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,050
I'll give you 60 if you let me.

2438
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:29,070
Oh yeah.

2439
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:30,210
Yeah, you can take 40.

2440
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,990
If you let me win, right?

2441
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:36,570
Because that's how much you love me, right?

2442
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:37,930
Yeah.

2443
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:40,570
You wouldn't lie to me like that, right?

2444
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:42,490
No, I wouldn't.

2445
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:43,510
Do I look like a man to you?

2446
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:44,270
Oh, that...

2447
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:46,610
Shit.

2448
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:48,670
Shit.

2449
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:54,090
Who hurt you?

2450
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:56,210
You know who.

2451
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:58,110
You know every single one of my exes.

2452
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:00,350
You literally know every one of my exes.

2453
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:02,950
You literally know every one of my exes.

2454
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:03,750
You're okay.

2455
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:07,750
What do you mean who hurt me?

2456
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:10,390
You know 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x.

2457
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:13,370
Red fish, blue fish, and purple.

2458
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:14,110
Red fish, blue fish, and purple.

2459
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:19,830
There is no eggs, Miya.

2460
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:21,170
They're the TV's.

2461
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:24,650
Oh, is that what the eggs are at the bottom, right?

2462
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,010
They're the TV's.

2463
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:28,770
Hey, anyone seen an egg ever?

2464
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:30,930
Wait, but what do we get if we get all the eggs?

2465
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:31,690
They're the TV's.

2466
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:33,150
They're the televisions.

2467
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:34,330
Oh.

2468
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:38,450
But what do we get if we get the Easter eggs?

2469
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:39,550
Do we get like a thousand dollars?

2470
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:42,570
We get a thousand dollars.

2471
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:44,150
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

2472
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:45,350
Oh, Toki, come here.

2473
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:48,110
Here, let's do this real quick.

2474
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:49,150
Yes, V.

2475
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:51,210
I don't know, I'm on the other end as well.

2476
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:52,990
Fine, but clutchable, clutchable?

2477
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:59,250
V, and then settings, and then turn 3D voice to reduced.

2478
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,410
Oh, 3D audio?

2479
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:03,770
Yeah, 3D audio to reduced.

2480
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:05,170
Oh, oh shit.

2481
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:06,410
That might help a bit.

2482
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:07,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2483
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:07,570
Oh, yeah.

2484
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:10,090
Minda, what do we do?

2485
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:13,070
Oh, wait, emo only chat, emo only chat.

2486
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:14,230
I got some of the Easter eggs.

2487
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,610
How many?

2488
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:17,930
There's three in this corridor.

2489
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:19,230
I got seven.

2490
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:20,430
There's one on the outside.

2491
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:20,870
I'm nine.

2492
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:24,550
Where, can you take me there?

2493
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:25,970
So how is this alliance gonna work?

2494
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:27,070
There's only seven seconds left.

2495
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:30,010
Alright, good luck everybody.

2496
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:31,650
Good luck.

2497
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:34,030
I'm blinking.

2498
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:35,370
I'm blinking too.

2499
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:38,270
Oh no.

2500
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:40,130
Oh no.

2501
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,450
Emo only, emo only, emo only.

2502
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:45,590
Oh, it's like a carnival.

2503
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:48,850
Oh my god, it's Disneyland!

2504
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:51,210
This is why Mickey's here!

2505
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:53,110
It's a carnival?

2506
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:56,810
This is exactly why Mickey was here.

2507
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:57,790
Whoopie.

2508
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,590
It's like an amusement park.

2509
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:01,450
I don't know.

2510
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:04,550
Wait, yo, yo, yo, BTMC.

2511
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,070
Yo, Sapna, we're gonna do something.

2512
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:08,730
I saw E-Rob.

2513
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:10,490
Yo, how did you do it?

2514
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:12,170
You got this bro.

2515
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:13,070
Best of luck.

2516
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:13,950
I'm scared guys.

2517
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:16,230
I'm so scared.

2518
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,830
I don't understand this game at all.

2519
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:19,670
I'm so scared.

2520
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:20,930
I'm so scared.

2521
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:24,970
I don't understand this game.

2522
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:25,350
I don't understand this game.

2523
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,870
I have to take a picture.

2524
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:27,110
I have to take a picture.

2525
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:30,990
Honestly, we're doing...

2526
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:33,670
It's because we're doing team with the gringos.

2527
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:34,590
Who the fuck?

2528
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:38,750
It's not as overwhelming as the first game.

2529
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:39,370
That's for sure.

2530
01:38:39,470 --> 01:38:40,550
Oh my god, it's Elmo in a bikini!

2531
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:43,730
Where's Elmo?

2532
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,370
In a bikini.

2533
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:49,230
Can I get a diamond formation?

2534
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,110
Where's my squad at bro?

2535
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:51,850
Yeah, where's my alliance?

2536
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,790
Where the heck is my alliance?

2537
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:56,810
I give you a high five at TwitchCon.

2538
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:57,530
So...

2539
01:38:58,290 --> 01:38:59,150
Oh my god.

2540
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:03,770
How am I supposed to survive without my allies?

2541
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:04,570
How am I supposed to survive without my allies?

2542
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:06,190
Rock, paper, scissors.

2543
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,930
How would I survive?

2544
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:11,490
It will play five games.

2545
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:12,630
Four rounds each.

2546
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:14,150
One versus one.

2547
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:14,710
No!

2548
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:17,210
Oh my god, that's so loud.

2549
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:19,010
That's so loud.

2550
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:23,190
I've never seen somebody so sad about rock, paper, scissors.

2551
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:26,710
Holy fuck.

2552
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:29,670
The guy was full on despair.

2553
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:33,590
What did rock, paper, scissors do to that man?

2554
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:34,430
I don't know.

2555
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:35,730
People are getting eliminated right now.

2556
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:36,550
30?

2557
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:39,450
I'm gonna be in that 30, guys.

2558
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:41,910
There's like a 50-50.

2559
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:43,330
There's like 80-30.

2560
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:46,550
A 20 chance I'm in that 30.

2561
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:47,230
Okay, what did you say?

2562
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:51,810
As the non-Minecraft player, I'm so fucked.

2563
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:58,490
The non-Minecraft player here.

2564
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:00,970
I'm actually fucked, guys.

2565
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:03,850
I'm actually fucked, guys.

2566
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:04,130
I'm actually fucked, guys.

2567
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:06,430
Why is the game volume loud?

2568
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:08,750
Oh my god, the ambient voice.

2569
01:40:08,990 --> 01:40:10,290
It's so loud.

2570
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,330
The music.

2571
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:19,030
Where's my ally groups?

2572
01:40:21,190 --> 01:40:22,870
Where's my ally group?

2573
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:27,390
There's so many other Minecrafters here.

2574
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:29,730
But not the ones I wanna find.

2575
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,410
Isn't that the fucking fighting game player?

2576
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:33,970
Oh my god.

2577
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:35,450
This is like the...

2578
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:38,070
The crossover of the century.

2579
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:39,490
Yeah, I think I'm gonna win.

2580
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:41,290
But just know...

2581
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:45,330
A Spanish streamer told me Argentina sucks.

2582
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:47,030
ERO!

2583
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:49,890
Oh my god, I was looking for you.

2584
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:51,290
That's...

2585
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:54,150
He's in the Spanish streamer game.

2586
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:55,390
Where the fuck is he going?

2587
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:56,490
Dude, he does.

2588
01:40:56,990 --> 01:40:58,310
Two more minutes, guys.

2589
01:40:58,590 --> 01:40:59,530
Two more minutes.

2590
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:01,490
I need to go from 7 to 8 digits in my...

2591
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:04,350
Why am I stressed out?

2592
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:06,070
I know I'm not gonna make it.

2593
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:12,790
I shouldn't be stressed out about this.

2594
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:15,670
We all know I'm not gonna make it to the end.

2595
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:17,690
We all know I'm not gonna make it to the end.

2596
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:24,390
We saw the top 20 in the fucking running course.

2597
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:25,430
in the fucking running course.

2598
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:26,830
Jesus Christ.

2599
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:31,010
That should not be that loud.

2600
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:31,470
That should not be that loud.

2601
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:34,390
I do not care about the ambience.

2602
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,290
They're so perfect.

2603
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:37,030
They're just...

2604
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:40,210
Please give me my cutscene.

2605
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:42,090
Please give me my cutscene.

2606
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:43,070
Wait, what's this?

2607
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:43,850
Are these the balloons?

2608
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,050
Oh, they're like balloons.

2609
01:41:47,210 --> 01:41:48,110
Whoever like...

2610
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:50,430
The team that made this world...

2611
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:52,030
It's actually insane though.

2612
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:54,210
The team that made this world...

2613
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:55,170
It's so...

2614
01:41:57,450 --> 01:41:58,610
It's so good.

2615
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,590
Do you really want to be with...

2616
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,590
I just love all the builds and everything.

2617
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:05,630
The aesthetics and stuff of everything.

2618
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,250
Like the world building.

2619
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:11,090
It's actually insane.

2620
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:12,210
Wait, there's more?

2621
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:14,230
There's an outside?

2622
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:17,610
The circus?

2623
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:19,050
There's...

2624
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,050
Oh my god.

2625
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:22,850
There's an outside?

2626
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:24,330
Does anyone know what his next game is?

2627
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:26,170
I think it's like rock, paper, scissors.

2628
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:28,030
But you get like one of the three.

2629
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:28,630
Alright.

2630
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:31,210
Holy shit.

2631
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:32,670
Oh my god.

2632
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:33,810
It's a deserted circus.

2633
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:36,130
What the hell?

2634
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:37,750
Where are the clowns at?

2635
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:39,270
Where to kill the clowns?

2636
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,690
Oh, wait.

2637
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:41,710
You can't even get up here.

2638
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:43,270
Scam.

2639
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:47,070
Holy shit.

2640
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:48,890
Bro, what is this?

2641
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:50,150
A circus for giants?

2642
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:51,990
Like, what the fuck?

2643
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:55,430
This area is actually huge.

2644
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:57,270
I'm scared.

2645
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:04,390
Why do we need such a big arena for rock, paper, scissors?

2646
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:07,070
I don't understand.

2647
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:12,990
If it's rock, paper, scissors, then like why do we need such a big area?

2648
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:14,810
A cage would work.

2649
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,940
Just put us in a fucking cage.

2650
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,680
Alright, off we go.

2651
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,800
Off we go.

2652
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:35,060
What's so embarrassing is, I actually played Rust, of course.

2653
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,380
I didn't know that.

2654
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:37,840
Oh my god.

2655
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:38,660
I'm still like, oh!

2656
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,540
Skull scroll blade.

2657
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,700
Oh this skull, I assume is...

2658
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,860
rock, paper, scissors.

2659
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,300
It's funny that we have a copyright free version of rock, paper, scissors.

2660
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,180
Congratulations to those who made it through Lights Out.

2661
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:57,120
The next nightmare will be a more intimate affair.

2662
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,480
The next nightmare will be a more intimate affair.

2663
01:43:59,480 --> 01:43:59,980
Yeah!

2664
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,280
Okay.

2665
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:27,280
Why do I keep choosing skull?

2666
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:46,700
Oh!

2667
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:53,880
Oh!

2668
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:59,600
The fuck?

2669
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:01,540
This is gaslighting!

2670
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:24,100
Ha!

2671
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,440
What the...

2672
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,500
That's the tiebreaker?

2673
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:39,980
Oh my god, those six... that's gonna be me.

2674
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,980
That's so stressful!

2675
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,300
Oh my god, guys.

2676
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:47,520
It was a good run, guys.

2677
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,040
I'm not a liar.

2678
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:54,180
I can't believe it.

2679
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,640
I can't lie, guys.

2680
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,100
I'm not known as a liar.

2681
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:01,480
Okay, I need a recap.

2682
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:04,060
Oh my god.

2683
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:05,500
This is gonna be so difficult.

2684
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,480
I'm so bad at lying!

2685
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:14,480
I can't believe it.

2686
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,980
I'm such a... I'm a good person.

2687
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,620
Being forced to lie and gaslight people.

2688
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,300
I don't know what career is.

2689
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:22,020
Why is this?

2690
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,640
This is gonna be... locate them, walk, talk to others.

2691
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:25,920
Oh, we have to find the circus.

2692
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:26,760
We rip it.

2693
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,100
We rip it.

2694
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:27,360
We rip it.

2695
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,240
Where the fuck was... oh, it was over here.

2696
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,580
We gotta go to the circus.

2697
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,280
The person to my left always tells a lie.

2698
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:37,720
Alright, there you go.

2699
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:38,720
We found the circus.

2700
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:42,660
New Jersey.

2701
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:45,860
Found it!

2702
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:47,860
We found the circus.

2703
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:49,600
Rigatoni with the Red Souls.

2704
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,160
How do I...

2705
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:53,320
I'm like trying to think how to fucking...

2706
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:54,420
Linguini.

2707
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:56,240
Mmm, yes.

2708
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:57,940
Amazon.

2709
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,860
They keep ordering their Uber Eats right now.

2710
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,140
Amazon.

2711
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:02,420
Farm of John.

2712
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:03,960
Farmer John.

2713
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,480
Farmer John.

2714
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,040
Why are they like, intruding on a date?

2715
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:13,440
I'm just this third wheel just listening to their fucking pasta order.

2716
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,400
I'm just like, what the hell?

2717
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:19,880
I'm thinking...

2718
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,420
I am!

2719
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:20,760
I am!

2720
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:20,980
You are!

2721
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:21,180
Go me!

2722
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:21,980
There you are!

2723
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,660
There I am.

2724
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:25,420
This game is gonna be so difficult.

2725
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:26,360
Did you see my DM by the way?

2726
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,000
Oh, you DMed me?

2727
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,320
Yeah, I just saw them.

2728
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:31,020
Oh!

2729
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:32,780
Oh, yeah, yeah!

2730
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:33,300
I saw it.

2731
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:35,740
Yeah, I saw them earlier too in the first round.

2732
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:37,720
Monka- Monka!

2733
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2734
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:38,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2735
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:39,440
Don't worry.

2736
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:40,080
Don't worry.

2737
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,080
Don't get eliminated.

2738
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:41,840
Protect me.

2739
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:42,560
Don't worry.

2740
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:43,560
I'll protect you!

2741
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:46,440
Oh my God.

2742
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:49,200
This game is gonna be so difficult.

2743
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:50,400
Because, like, you have to like...

2744
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,680
You have to lie and I don't... I'm not always tell the truth.

2745
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:54,400
Shut up!

2746
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:57,280
Shut up!

2747
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:58,940
What do you mean?

2748
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,500
Stop talking!

2749
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,780
This is so difficult!

2750
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,940
Wait, wait.

2751
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,520
We're forming an alliance, right?

2752
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,160
Yeah, yeah.

2753
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:16,780
So like when you fight me, let me win because I'll lose... I'll get kicked out.

2754
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,320
Well, it's whoever has less points.

2755
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,940
Yeah, yeah, but you'll let me farm points off of you, right?

2756
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,360
Hello!

2757
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:21,960
Hello!

2758
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:24,380
Well, only if I have more points than you.

2759
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,400
Yeah, yeah.

2760
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,280
And you'll always have more points than me.

2761
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:28,160
You're a Minecraft player.

2762
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,840
Girl, this game ain't got nothing to do with Minecraft.

2763
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:35,120
You're a Minecraft... Yeah, people... people trust you!

2764
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:36,620
People don't...

2765
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:36,880
That's true!

2766
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:40,380
And people also trust me too, but like I'm just way too trustworthy.

2767
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:41,100
Don't trust me.

2768
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:46,200
You let me farm points off you, right?

2769
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:48,300
You let me farm points off you.

2770
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:48,580
I would vote.

2771
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,420
Right?

2772
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,480
If I get eliminated, who will bring the content?

2773
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:52,940
I'm gonna be...

2774
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:56,080
I have bad luck, but...

2775
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,820
I only have good luck when... when it doesn't matter.

2776
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:00,760
It's okay.

2777
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:05,060
Alright, when you're up against me, just pick... just pick Blade, okay?

2778
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:05,700
I'm just...

2779
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:07,040
Every time, you pick Blade.

2780
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:11,340
I... I'm gonna... I'm gonna pick... I'm gonna pick...

2781
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:12,200
Yeah, yeah, pick Blade.

2782
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:13,400
The biggest brain.

2783
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:16,080
Wait, Gumi, what is it?

2784
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,080
What is it, Gumi?

2785
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,100
Oh, wait, she's AFK.

2786
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:20,680
Never mind.

2787
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:22,840
It's okay, guys.

2788
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,040
We got this, guys.

2789
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,400
Gumi will let me farm points off of her, so I won't be bottom six, guys.

2790
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:29,960
Of 28 people.

2791
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:31,320
There's no way.

2792
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,140
There's no way.

2793
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,920
Of 28 people.

2794
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:40,000
I refuse to be... the worst player.

2795
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:45,120
Right, channeling all of my lucky charms I had in my cereal last week.

2796
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:48,180
Yeah, yeah, just pick Blade when you're up against me.

2797
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:49,100
Just pick Blade.

2798
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:51,520
What happened to...

2799
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,540
What happened to...

2800
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:54,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Gumi, go ahead and pick Blade.

2801
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,500
My gun was like the big brain move.

2802
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,500
Pick Blade when you're...

2803
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,200
Don't be a rock, paper, scissors.

2804
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:57,620
What if you have scroll?

2805
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:58,440
What if you have scroll?

2806
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,300
There's no way.

2807
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,620
There's no... I'm telling... I don't lie.

2808
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:01,380
I tell the truth.

2809
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,020
Just pick Blade.

2810
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:03,680
What do you mean?

2811
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,880
You don't even know yet.

2812
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:05,680
You're lying to yourself.

2813
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,160
No, I'm gonna pick Skull.

2814
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,260
That's why I told you to pick Blade.

2815
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:12,120
You can't pick Skull.

2816
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:12,920
You get RNG.

2817
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:13,700
Give it one.

2818
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:15,360
Oh.

2819
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:16,960
No, I get three.

2820
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:19,340
No, they said they give you three and you get the pick.

2821
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,480
That's if you're opposing them.

2822
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,760
That's if you're opposing... if you're the opposing side.

2823
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,000
What?

2824
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,740
I don't... I'm... I don't...

2825
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:28,700
Okay, so there's two people sitting at the table, yes?

2826
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:29,020
Yeah.

2827
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:29,920
There's two people sitting at the table.

2828
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:37,160
One of them... you don't know who you are, but one of them gets given a randomized scroll, blade, or skull.

2829
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:41,280
And the other person has to guess which one that person got.

2830
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,920
Only one person gets to choose.

2831
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,340
That's fucking stupid.

2832
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,180
Not both of them.

2833
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,440
Wait, my whole plan.

2834
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:51,840
My whole plan.

2835
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,460
I'm gonna take that as a yes you.

2836
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,300
My whole plan.

2837
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:02,520
Okay, okay, when you're up against me, I will always tell the truth, Gumi.

2838
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:03,020
You'll tell me?

2839
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:03,760
You'll tell me?

2840
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:03,900
Yeah.

2841
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:08,040
I'll always tell the truth and you'll let me farm off of you so I won't get eliminated.

2842
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,280
Yeah, you're gonna tell...

2843
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:11,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2844
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:13,460
Eeyo.

2845
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:14,540
Hey.

2846
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:14,880
Hello.

2847
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:17,700
Oh my god, my entire plan.

2848
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,420
It's over.

2849
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,240
It's so over.

2850
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,200
It was just not clicking in your head.

2851
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:23,580
You're like, what?

2852
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:27,760
I thought it was just regular rock, paper, scissors.

2853
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:30,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2854
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,800
Gumi, are you going into our lobby?

2855
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,600
Do you trust us?

2856
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:36,300
Yeah.

2857
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,020
Wait, how do we pick colors?

2858
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,060
Oh, you see around the map?

2859
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,520
Listen, listen, Doki.

2860
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:42,080
No, no, no, listen.

2861
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:42,760
Yeah?

2862
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,340
Wait, wait, wait.

2863
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,540
We legit... we can team up, okay?

2864
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,700
Like, we don't know who we'll play against.

2865
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:48,960
It's 28 people per lobby.

2866
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:49,500
Yeah.

2867
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:50,140
We need a win.

2868
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,620
We can farm each other.

2869
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:52,860
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2870
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:53,560
There's a text.

2871
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,560
There's a text that the Minecrafters were telling me.

2872
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,100
Yeah?

2873
01:51:56,220 --> 01:52:06,800
They were telling me, basically, you make an alliance and in your alliance, if you go against each other, whoever has more points, they lose on purpose to the person who has less points.

2874
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:07,500
That's literally...

2875
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:09,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

2876
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:09,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2877
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:12,320
I can say that in more complex words, though.

2878
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2879
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2880
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:14,660
Oh!

2881
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,880
Alright, wait, what color?

2882
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:16,580
Whoa!

2883
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:19,880
Oh my god, we're in an infinite alliance!

2884
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,620
Wait, wait, what color?

2885
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,000
Where's me?

2886
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:25,060
Where's me?

2887
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:25,420
Close.

2888
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:28,920
Doki, Doki, Doki, Doki, Doki.

2889
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,440
I'm not last.

2890
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:29,920
I'm not last.

2891
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:30,380
Yeah, yeah.

2892
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:31,980
Let's go this way.

2893
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:33,160
Shut up, Sleepy.

2894
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:34,040
Where do we go?

2895
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:34,540
Where do we go?

2896
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,020
Wait, wait, we're trying to rally.

2897
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:38,800
Where do we go?

2898
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:39,260
Where do we go?

2899
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:41,040
I'm so confused.

2900
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:42,300
Oh my god.

2901
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,500
Oh my god, Sleepy's making me confused.

2902
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:44,900
E-Rob, E-Rob.

2903
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:46,240
Where do we go?

2904
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,020
Which color?

2905
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,740
We got a group, we got a group.

2906
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:49,840
Where's Abe?

2907
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,560
Where the fuck is Abe?

2908
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:50,880
Where did Abe go?

2909
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:52,700
He got lost in the massacre.

2910
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:53,000
I don't know, I don't know.

2911
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:54,940
Where's Guapo, man?

2912
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:56,240
We all got lost.

2913
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:58,700
Go in there, go in the pink.

2914
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,440
Go in the pink.

2915
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:01,620
Oh no, it's already over.

2916
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,000
Oh god, they're filling up, guys.

2917
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:03,620
They're filling up real quick.

2918
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:05,020
Oh, we have to pick one color.

2919
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:06,060
We gotta choose, we gotta choose.

2920
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:06,460
What do we do?

2921
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:07,940
We can't pick pink because...

2922
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:09,640
Fuck, Abe, we gotta...

2923
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:10,940
Oh, there's Abe, there's Abe, there's Abe.

2924
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:11,820
There's Abe, there's Abe.

2925
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,180
Blue, blue, blue, blue, go blue, go blue.

2926
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,000
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

2927
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:14,900
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2928
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,400
Blue is filling up though.

2929
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:19,580
What if we don't make it?

2930
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:20,980
Yeah, what if we don't make it?

2931
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:21,840
We have to split up.

2932
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:22,820
Okay, we split, we split.

2933
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:24,040
I see you on the other side.

2934
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:24,920
Okay.

2935
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:26,860
All right, we're good, we're fine.

2936
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:27,540
How many people?

2937
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:29,720
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

2938
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:30,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2939
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,260
What if I want to leave?

2940
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:34,640
Wait, what if they have a bigger team than us?

2941
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:36,300
Smoke me, I'm picking rock.

2942
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:38,320
I'm picking rock.

2943
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,880
Why can't we get in here?

2944
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:40,520
Get in here, get in here.

2945
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:41,300
This is my favorite.

2946
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,180
Oh my god.

2947
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:44,640
You can be, you can be mentally fortified.

2948
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,080
It's not going to change the fact that I'm picking rock.

2949
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:47,240
Okay.

2950
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,260
Wait, go me.

2951
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:51,800
What are you doing?

2952
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:53,980
Sleepy.

2953
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,160
What are you doing?

2954
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,200
I am.

2955
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:57,540
I'm scared.

2956
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,180
Go me left.

2957
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:58,980
Yeah.

2958
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,060
Get on the platform.

2959
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:00,800
I'm not going to tell you.

2960
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:03,480
You're not, you're not as fortified as I am.

2961
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,940
Go me, go me left.

2962
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:07,000
You, whoa.

2963
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:08,300
I'm going to kill you.

2964
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:10,100
Where did, where did go me go?

2965
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,040
Go me, go me.

2966
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,600
Are you not doing?

2967
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:14,140
Yeah.

2968
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,300
Oh, come on.

2969
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:15,760
Oh.

2970
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:16,920
What?

2971
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:17,520
Oh, you're right.

2972
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:17,940
You're right.

2973
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:18,580
He's right.

2974
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,300
Sleepy, sleepy.

2975
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:20,800
Use two of your brain cells.

2976
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,020
Use two of your brain cells.

2977
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:22,640
Hey, what the heck was that?

2978
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,140
Who hit me?

2979
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:25,140
What the hell was that?

2980
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:25,400
Hey.

2981
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:26,760
Look what you're looking at.

2982
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,340
Oh yeah, we can stay here.

2983
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:28,840
We can stay here.

2984
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:29,700
Hey, hey.

2985
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:32,920
I'm going to talk to you.

2986
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,080
I need Reggie.

2987
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:34,700
Oh.

2988
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,240
You've thought.

2989
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,380
You've thought about it.

2990
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:37,620
Oh.

2991
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:39,360
I was here before you thought.

2992
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:42,180
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2993
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:44,080
Hannah's on our team.

2994
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:44,620
We're cool.

2995
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:45,080
We're cool.

2996
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:51,480
I don't know if you're whispering about something, but I can't hear you now.

2997
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:52,900
I'm just saying we're good.

2998
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,220
We're good.

2999
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:54,100
We're cool.

3000
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:54,860
We're cool.

3001
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:55,960
We're cool.

3002
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,300
Are we cool?

3003
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:59,100
We're so cool.

3004
01:54:59,260 --> 01:54:59,760
Are we cool?

3005
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:01,220
What?

3006
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:05,940
I think the other groups have bigger alliances than us.

3007
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,240
But that's okay.

3008
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:07,620
That's okay.

3009
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:08,800
We're cool.

3010
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:08,980
I think we're cool.

3011
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,020
I think we're cool.

3012
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:10,260
I think so too.

3013
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:10,380
There are so many more people.

3014
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:10,820
Are you in?

3015
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,320
I feel like I know too many people.

3016
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,640
Hey, don't get knocked out.

3017
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:14,200
It's almost full.

3018
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:14,760
It's almost full.

3019
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,240
Oh, are you in?

3020
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,420
Oh, we're back in.

3021
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,120
Hey, we're a team.

3022
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:19,500
We're a team.

3023
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:19,840
We're a team.

3024
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,040
No beef.

3025
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:21,380
No beef.

3026
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:21,720
I'm sorry.

3027
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:22,200
I'm a little scared.

3028
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:23,440
I'm a little scared.

3029
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:27,520
I got free.

3030
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,820
They're kicking people out.

3031
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:30,900
They're kicking people out.

3032
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,460
We have to do something like four and you've seen Mark and me like twenty times in a row.

3033
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:34,460
Guys, stop it.

3034
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:34,460
What?

3035
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:35,100
What?

3036
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:36,400
We match up against each other.

3037
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:37,600
I'm scared.

3038
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:42,000
I'm scared of getting knocked out.

3039
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:43,320
I'm scared of getting locked out.

3040
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:48,040
I'm gonna read their minds.

3041
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:51,060
I'm gonna crunch the numbers and do the math.

3042
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,460
Yeah, Samuelson, you're gonna do all that?

3043
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:55,960
Whoa, whoa, I'm not Samuelson.

3044
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,220
I'm Sam's little brother right now.

3045
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:59,220
Oh, what's your name?

3046
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,160
Yeah, well, my name's Lil Sam.

3047
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:04,940
Lil Sam?

3048
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:05,920
That's crazy.

3049
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,600
I mean, regardless, this is up to chance anyways.

3050
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,280
Yeah, it doesn't get any better.

3051
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,160
I was missing the first game.

3052
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:14,100
He had to throw me off.

3053
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,500
Every team's gonna have a bunch of faces we recognize.

3054
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:18,820
How do we choose?

3055
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,980
Also, I'm not gonna lie here.

3056
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:25,580
The other teams we haven't checked out are all gonna have HPG, like a bunch of them.

3057
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:27,540
What?

3058
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:29,140
I said Rikkiu!

3059
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:31,940
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

3060
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,760
I'll do the same.

3061
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:35,740
Same shit, same shit.

3062
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:39,360
According to the mathematics, you should average one point per game.

3063
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,140
So if you're like 10 games in, you should have around 10 points.

3064
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:41,180
I'm scared, guys.

3065
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:41,800
I'm scared.

3066
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:43,440
I'm scared.

3067
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,860
You know what I mean?

3068
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:47,720
Because two for win, zero for loss.

3069
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,120
Doki, there's a common evil.

3070
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,000
There's a common evil.

3071
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:53,660
If you're not at one point per game, come on.

3072
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,420
Yeah, yeah, then it's...

3073
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:57,340
As long as you're getting some.

3074
01:56:58,960 --> 01:56:59,600
Is it?

3075
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:00,440
Is it?

3076
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:03,800
We have to make sure the women win.

3077
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,900
I'm just saying that that should be the metric.

3078
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:05,080
Oh, okay.

3079
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:06,160
You and I are both women.

3080
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,120
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3081
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:10,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3082
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:13,540
So that means you gotta make sure I live through the next round.

3083
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:14,360
You gotta make sure.

3084
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:16,400
Girl, you can make sure of yourself.

3085
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:19,100
No, no, this is a group effort.

3086
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,040
Doki!

3087
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:27,400
This is a group effort, Gumi.

3088
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:27,760
Oh!

3089
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:29,020
Hey!

3090
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:31,760
I forgot, I forgot, I forgot that it actually hits.

3091
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:33,780
Oh my god, that's fucked up!

3092
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:36,980
That's messed up.

3093
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:37,640
Yeah, I can't hear a shit.

3094
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:39,420
I did not mean to hit you.

3095
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:40,180
Gumi, I'm sorry.

3096
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:41,780
Oh, emo only.

3097
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,320
Don't worry, we already have emo only.

3098
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:44,400
Oh my god, I'm sorry, I apologize.

3099
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:46,380
Oh, because...

3100
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:47,520
You win, I win, okay?

3101
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,020
We can Fortnite.

3102
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,260
Oh, oh, oh gosh!

3103
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:50,740
I should try.

3104
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:52,660
Eva!

3105
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:56,020
I'm thinking, guys, when we face each other, do not draw.

3106
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,220
I should have told everybody I'm gonna be completely honest with you.

3107
01:57:58,760 --> 01:57:59,500
Oh, goodbye!

3108
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:04,020
Why do you get kicked out before the round starts?

3109
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,080
Oh!

3110
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:14,060
We have one minute, Abe, to get in here.

3111
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:14,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3112
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:16,940
Yeah, you want the one-time.

3113
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,540
Like, if I'm going on...

3114
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:26,100
Abe gets kicked out, you see, he's not in.

3115
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:26,920
I got it, okay?

3116
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:29,180
One minute left, Abe!

3117
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:35,860
Oh, shit.

3118
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,720
Oh, shit.

3119
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:38,080
Don't pick off the latency!

3120
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:45,280
Wait, it'll be, like, a free win!

3121
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:48,640
Only five people in the elevator can keep out!

3122
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:50,600
We're picking you off the TV.

3123
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:52,440
One, two, three!

3124
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:54,380
One, two, three!

3125
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:54,840
One, two, three!

3126
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:56,080
What happened?

3127
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:57,180
You're not in the circle.

3128
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:57,600
What is happening?

3129
01:58:57,600 --> 01:58:57,620
How does this work?

3130
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,280
Yeah, he is in the circle.

3131
01:58:58,280 --> 01:58:58,440
When is the end?

3132
01:58:58,440 --> 01:58:58,460
Oh, you are in the circle.

3133
01:58:58,460 --> 01:58:59,140
We are trapping her!

3134
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,200
And Abe's out of the circle!

3135
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:03,440
Oh Abe, Abe you're being sacrificed!

3136
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,160
I don't know what's going on!

3137
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,680
What is it?

3138
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:10,120
Good luck Abe!

3139
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,600
Fifty seconds!

3140
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:15,060
Fifty seconds!

3141
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:15,680
Fifty seconds!

3142
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:16,140
No we can't!

3143
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:17,700
We just have to win two rounds!

3144
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:19,580
Abe's gonna get it!

3145
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:22,680
I'm gonna push you out of the door!

3146
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:24,580
I'm gonna push you out of the door!

3147
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,500
Three left!

3148
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:28,860
Oh my god!

3149
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:30,420
Holy shit!

3150
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:35,940
I hope you're not going up against me!

3151
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:38,240
Oh shit!

3152
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:39,460
Well...

3153
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:40,740
Hello!

3154
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:44,520
So...

3155
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:49,440
You probably want to know what item I was assigned, don't you?

3156
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:49,840
Yeah!

3157
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:51,820
I mean you wouldn't lie to me, right?

3158
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,360
Wouldn't you like to know?

3159
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,540
I'd love to know!

3160
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,460
Alright, five gifted subs if you tell me what you have right now!

3161
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,700
I actually developed a strategy!

3162
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:02,900
You gotta listen to the mathematics!

3163
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,020
Okay, okay I'm listening!

3164
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:09,780
So on average, if you get at least one point a game, you should be fine!

3165
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:11,080
But...

3166
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:16,680
The outcome out of each round is usually two points unless we draw.

3167
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,800
And if we draw, then the outcome is one point's net.

3168
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,220
So if we just trade wins...

3169
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:22,620
Yeah!

3170
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:23,680
Oh that's so smart!

3171
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,100
Yeah, yeah you wanna do that?

3172
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:26,380
Yeah!

3173
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:26,480
I'm gonna do it!

3174
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,760
Oh my god!

3175
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:29,600
You cooked me!

3176
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:32,560
Sorry, can you explain again?

3177
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:33,980
You actually wanna do that!

3178
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:35,500
No, I got confused!

3179
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:36,680
I got confused!

3180
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,540
We trade wins...

3181
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:41,320
So...

3182
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:43,240
You won the first one...

3183
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:45,560
Yeah, so then I let you win the next one, right?

3184
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,960
Yes, and then you won the one after that...

3185
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:49,740
And then...

3186
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:51,860
I won that one after that...

3187
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,720
And then...

3188
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:56,500
I guess the last one will just stand up to chance.

3189
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,160
Okay, yeah that sounds fun!

3190
02:00:58,960 --> 02:00:59,440
Okay...

3191
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:02,220
I'm so serious about this too!

3192
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,200
I'm so serious!

3193
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,680
Tell me what you have, I will let you win again!

3194
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:06,460
I will let you win again!

3195
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,260
And then...

3196
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:10,460
You let me win the one after that?

3197
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:12,500
Yes, yes, yes.

3198
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:14,820
Okay, I have a blade.

3199
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:15,700
I'm so serious!

3200
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,640
You actually have a blade!

3201
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:19,520
Why would I lie to you?

3202
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:21,880
I'm so serious!

3203
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,700
This is actually messed up!

3204
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:26,380
Okay!

3205
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:27,320
Oh my god!

3206
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:28,300
Wait!

3207
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:29,260
You lied to me!

3208
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:29,720
Oh wait!

3209
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:29,860
Okay!

3210
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,140
I forgot I was letting you win!

3211
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:33,320
Okay, I'll troll what I have now!

3212
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:33,840
Oh, okay!

3213
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:37,220
I actually didn't even... I have paper!

3214
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,600
You have paper?

3215
02:01:39,540 --> 02:01:41,240
Yes, I actually have paper.

3216
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:42,120
I'm not trolling.

3217
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:43,740
You're actually not trolling?

3218
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:44,120
So...

3219
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,600
Yes, I have paper, so you go knife...

3220
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,240
Okay!

3221
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:50,180
Yeah, right?

3222
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:51,240
That's how you go.

3223
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,700
But like, what are you lying about?

3224
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:54,120
You lied to me!

3225
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:56,800
I swear to you I'm not lying!

3226
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:59,060
I know I just tricked you, but I swear...

3227
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,440
Wait, I thought you said it was an accident earlier!

3228
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,340
That means you were purposely tricking me!

3229
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:06,680
I'm actually just dumb!

3230
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:07,500
Wait, so like...

3231
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:08,640
Oh, now you're just dumb!

3232
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:09,420
Oh, I see!

3233
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:11,760
I'm actually just dumb?

3234
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:13,040
I have paper, though.

3235
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:14,100
Oh, okay.

3236
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:17,780
So like, do we just wait?

3237
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:20,640
Well, you choose...

3238
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:22,040
You choose knife, right?

3239
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:22,560
You choose knife.

3240
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:22,760
Yeah.

3241
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:23,940
Does that knife?

3242
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,520
Oh, you did have paper!

3243
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:29,640
Oh...

3244
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,280
You don't trust me, huh?

3245
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:33,140
I mean, you didn't trust me, too!

3246
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,840
I'm actually an idiot!

3247
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,620
I actually messed it up the second time!

3248
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,380
You messed it up the second time?

3249
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:40,400
Like, what do you mean by that?

3250
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:42,520
No, like, on round two, I'm...

3251
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:43,980
No, wait, no, on round...

3252
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:45,920
I don't even know.

3253
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:46,440
I don't know.

3254
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:47,080
You know what?

3255
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:48,560
Let's just make it...

3256
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,360
Let's make it special.

3257
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:51,480
Let's not... I won't even tell you what I have.

3258
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,420
Because I actually didn't look, so...

3259
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:56,360
I don't even know what I have.

3260
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:01,080
I don't even know what I have.

3261
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:02,380
Ew.

3262
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:02,720
What could...

3263
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:03,460
We could've worked together.

3264
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:04,500
This could've been fine.

3265
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:09,060
I mean, I did try to work together with you, but you didn't even...

3266
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:09,300
I mean, I did try to work together with you, but you didn't even...

3267
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:09,300
You tricked me!

3268
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:11,160
I will give you this one if you tell me what you have!

3269
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:12,120
What I have?

3270
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,480
I think I have paper.

3271
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:13,940
No, I tricked you on the second one because I'm an idiot!

3272
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:16,200
I think it was paper.

3273
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:17,180
I don't remember.

3274
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:20,700
Or was it rock?

3275
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:22,320
I think it was rock.

3276
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:23,340
It was rock or paper.

3277
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:26,220
Oh, see?

3278
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:27,160
You're a liar.

3279
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:28,820
I'm gonna tell my group about you.

3280
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:29,280
What?

3281
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:31,940
I'm gonna tell my group about you that you're a liar.

3282
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,060
I'm packing you up right now!

3283
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:34,880
I'm packing you up right now!

3284
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,400
I think it was a lie.

3285
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:37,980
Stop!

3286
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:38,280
Stop!

3287
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:38,540
Stop!

3288
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:42,640
I love you!

3289
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:43,860
I love you!

3290
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:45,620
He's a liar.

3291
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:48,940
Please remember me.

3292
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:49,540
I love you!

3293
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:50,100
I'll get you!

3294
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:51,420
Squid's a liar.

3295
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:52,620
Don't trust him.

3296
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,020
He's a liar?

3297
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:56,480
Squid's a liar?

3298
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,200
Don't trust Squid.

3299
02:03:58,700 --> 02:03:59,580
What about you?

3300
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:00,260
Ducky.

3301
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:04,720
It's what we talked about.

3302
02:04:05,100 --> 02:04:05,500
It's in the chat.

3303
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:07,260
I'm not lying.

3304
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:08,020
I know.

3305
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:09,460
I know.

3306
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:13,060
I told my group about you!

3307
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:13,760
What'd you say?

3308
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:17,100
I told my group about you!

3309
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:17,180
No!

3310
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:17,840
I'm sorry!

3311
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:19,900
I appreciate you telling me.

3312
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:22,000
I admit myself to be lying.

3313
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:25,020
You just lied to me!

3314
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:26,740
I need to be back in the room!

3315
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:27,700
I need to be back in the room!

3316
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:28,360
This is too loud!

3317
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:29,140
This is too loud!

3318
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,300
You said Skrull and it was Skrull!

3319
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:32,200
Are you okay?

3320
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:34,340
That was way too loud.

3321
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,840
Why is the intro so loud?

3322
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:38,600
Did you win yours?

3323
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:41,880
Squid's a liar.

3324
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,120
Squid's a liar.

3325
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:43,880
Don't trust him.

3326
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:45,300
Mimi's a liar too.

3327
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:46,480
Mendo, who?

3328
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,760
Mimi Lena.

3329
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:48,300
Okay.

3330
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:51,920
Pizza had to choose her.

3331
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:52,820
We went 4-4.

3332
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:57,800
I had the gut instinct that you were deceiving me.

3333
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,000
I had the gut instinct that you were deceiving me.

3334
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:58,800
Yeah, I got lied to.

3335
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:00,420
I got 4 points.

3336
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:01,940
I got 2 points though.

3337
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:05,480
How much did Erob get?

3338
02:05:05,860 --> 02:05:06,860
How much did Erob get?

3339
02:05:07,620 --> 02:05:08,100
Erob!

3340
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:10,220
Wake up!

3341
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:11,160
He's immune.

3342
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:12,500
Wake up!

3343
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:15,020
Did you win or lose?

3344
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,080
Yes.

3345
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:17,240
Good luck to us.

3346
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:19,220
Who was it?

3347
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,000
I got lied to.

3348
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:21,540
I got 2 points.

3349
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:24,980
Who was it?

3350
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:26,220
Are you a liar?

3351
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:27,820
You got me though, right?

3352
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:30,140
I can't lie.

3353
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:30,980
I have a problem.

3354
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:31,740
I don't have any...

3355
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:33,380
I can't do it.

3356
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:33,940
Hey.

3357
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:36,500
Oh.

3358
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:39,680
Well, well, well.

3359
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:40,220
Hey.

3360
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,120
I'm 2 wins, 2 losses.

3361
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:47,420
We traded wins and losses with my last person.

3362
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:48,120
Oh, sweet.

3363
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,500
Okay, anyway.

3364
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,820
Don't trust Squid because he's a fucking liar.

3365
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:53,520
Okay, I'm thinking about you.

3366
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:54,480
I don't know who Squid is.

3367
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:57,820
But I'm thinking about you and the person right in front of me here.

3368
02:05:57,980 --> 02:06:00,020
What item did you just get?

3369
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:01,480
I got a blade.

3370
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:03,460
I want to trust you.

3371
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,740
Yeah, you should.

3372
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,640
I'm very trustworthy.

3373
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:10,240
But this first round is gonna decide how we're gonna do the rest of this game.

3374
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,260
I'm willing to be trustworthy.

3375
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:12,260
Okay, cool.

3376
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:14,760
Alright, so I'm gonna lock it in with 10 seconds left.

3377
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:15,300
Alright.

3378
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:17,740
Doki, don't do it.

3379
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:18,620
Don't do it.

3380
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:19,720
I know you lost round 1.

3381
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:20,640
Yeah.

3382
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:23,100
I didn't lie about it.

3383
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:24,440
Don't switch up on me.

3384
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:24,980
Oh, wow.

3385
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:26,080
You're actually being honest.

3386
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:26,540
Yeah.

3387
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:29,500
Now...

3388
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:31,260
Okay, okay.

3389
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:32,660
I need to be smart about this.

3390
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:34,880
Yeah?

3391
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,980
Are you gonna keep lying?

3392
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:37,560
No, no.

3393
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,620
How about this?

3394
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,560
You know you're not gonna win the $70,000.

3395
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,240
Who says?

3396
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:42,720
Whoa, whoa!

3397
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:44,380
You said something I don't like you!

3398
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:45,400
Wow!

3399
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:48,280
That's a loser's mentality right there!

3400
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,580
And I'm a winner!

3401
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:50,240
I'm gonna do it!

3402
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:52,140
Wait, what item did I just get?

3403
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:53,180
I think I missed it.

3404
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:53,740
I don't know.

3405
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:56,260
You've been assigned an item.

3406
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,400
I can't see it!

3407
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:58,540
Oh, there it is.

3408
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:00,240
How did you see it?

3409
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:01,700
You pressed F.

3410
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:03,540
So I got...

3411
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:05,260
a knife.

3412
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:06,060
Okay.

3413
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:09,440
So does that mean I get that round?

3414
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:09,900
Does that mean I get that round?

3415
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:12,300
If you skull, you will win.

3416
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:13,240
Alright.

3417
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:15,500
I'm putting that skull in.

3418
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:17,840
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

3419
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:19,060
Nope.

3420
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:20,440
I just met you, but...

3421
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:22,680
We just met, but you wouldn't lie to me, right?

3422
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:24,000
I'm literally a bear!

3423
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:24,860
Oh!

3424
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:26,240
Wait, you're a truther!

3425
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:27,780
I'm a truther.

3426
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,580
You're a truther!

3427
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:31,300
I told you I went back and forth exactly like this with my last person.

3428
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:31,660
Okay.

3429
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:34,240
Because all you gotta do is not lose everything.

3430
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:34,860
Yeah.

3431
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:36,580
You just win two and lose two.

3432
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:37,440
You'll be in the middle.

3433
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:37,900
You'll be fine.

3434
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:38,620
You get through.

3435
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,120
Okay.

3436
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:39,940
Alright.

3437
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:40,500
I have it.

3438
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:40,760
I have a skull.

3439
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:43,620
Deadass, you have a skull?

3440
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:43,940
Yeah!

3441
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,840
What's something you really care about in life?

3442
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:48,300
What's something you really care about in life?

3443
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:49,660
I care about...

3444
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:50,520
You have animals?

3445
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:51,440
You got like a pet?

3446
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:51,940
Whoa!

3447
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:53,400
What are you do to my animal?

3448
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:56,600
No, what I'm saying is I want you to put that promise.

3449
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:57,460
No, what I'm saying is I want you to put that promise.

3450
02:07:57,900 --> 02:08:02,060
Alright, if it's not a skull, I'll let you kill my pet.

3451
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:03,440
In game.

3452
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,160
In Minecraft.

3453
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:08,060
Okay, I'm just gonna trust you because...

3454
02:08:08,060 --> 02:08:08,100
It's a skull!

3455
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,700
We can get out of here alive.

3456
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:11,880
Both of us!

3457
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:12,140
See?

3458
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,660
Oh wait, the timer's not up.

3459
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:16,600
Wait, what?

3460
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:20,120
I thought the timer... You have to wait until it's zero.

3461
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:21,280
Mm-mm.

3462
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:23,580
I would never lie to you.

3463
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:24,160
I'm trusting you.

3464
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:25,000
Nice.

3465
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,540
And now my turn.

3466
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:33,650
Wait, whose turn is it?

3467
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:34,370
It's my turn.

3468
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:35,110
What do you have?

3469
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:36,790
Dude, this is crazy.

3470
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:39,830
Because I've been getting knifed every single round.

3471
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:42,470
I got a knife again.

3472
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:43,130
Okay.

3473
02:08:43,290 --> 02:08:44,690
So I can put this then.

3474
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:47,190
How much... Alright.

3475
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:47,850
Alright.

3476
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:50,130
What do you love in life?

3477
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:51,930
I love my mother.

3478
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:53,670
Okay, well...

3479
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,150
I'm gonna build a statue of your mom.

3480
02:08:56,630 --> 02:08:57,510
In Minecraft.

3481
02:08:57,690 --> 02:08:58,810
If you lie to me.

3482
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:00,710
And I'll blow it up.

3483
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:03,150
Doki.

3484
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:05,350
I love my mom.

3485
02:09:05,390 --> 02:09:06,510
So I'm gonna change my mind.

3486
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:09,290
I said if you lied to me.

3487
02:09:09,410 --> 02:09:09,990
I have a scroll.

3488
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:09,990
I know.

3489
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,630
I love my mom too much is wrong.

3490
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:15,550
Yeah, I would post that video up too.

3491
02:09:16,070 --> 02:09:16,890
On YouTube.

3492
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:19,390
And you should check my channel subscriber.

3493
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:22,210
And see how many people are gonna watch it.

3494
02:09:22,350 --> 02:09:22,370
I'm already subscribed.

3495
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:26,070
It's a draw.

3496
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:27,190
Okay.

3497
02:09:30,110 --> 02:09:31,210
So you did lie.

3498
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:32,630
I lied.

3499
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:33,450
You did lie.

3500
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:36,850
You did lie.

3501
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:39,570
You did lie.

3502
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:42,130
I'm at 11.

3503
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:43,710
Oh, that's good.

3504
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:45,010
Are you like fully like...

3505
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:47,770
I got 5 points.

3506
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:48,670
Okay.

3507
02:09:48,930 --> 02:09:51,130
Did you vote?

3508
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:54,490
I have 5 points.

3509
02:09:54,490 --> 02:09:55,710
How many points do you have?

3510
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:56,210
6.

3511
02:09:56,650 --> 02:09:59,090
Who are you playing against?

3512
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:01,350
I wanna get speed TMC.

3513
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:02,730
Oh, nice.

3514
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:03,030
Okay.

3515
02:10:05,510 --> 02:10:06,490
Oh, this is...

3516
02:10:06,510 --> 02:10:06,710
This is scary.

3517
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:08,670
It's on the top left.

3518
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:10,670
TinyMakda is cool.

3519
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:11,510
I got 6.

3520
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:12,470
TinyMakda is cool.

3521
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:13,930
BTMC is cool.

3522
02:10:15,590 --> 02:10:16,690
BTMC is not cool.

3523
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:19,090
It's not cool.

3524
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:20,990
He's not cool with you, Abe.

3525
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:24,650
You're not cool with anyone, man.

3526
02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:25,930
Toki is not cool.

3527
02:10:26,030 --> 02:10:27,030
Wait, what do you mean?

3528
02:10:28,050 --> 02:10:30,150
I've been a true 3 this entire time.

3529
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:31,850
I'm nervous.

3530
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:33,610
Toki more like Dookie.

3531
02:10:34,230 --> 02:10:34,670
Wow.

3532
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:36,570
Dookie.

3533
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:38,350
Damn.

3534
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:41,330
I knew I should punch you out.

3535
02:10:41,370 --> 02:10:42,650
I knew I should punch you out.

3536
02:10:44,350 --> 02:10:45,090
I got 6.

3537
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:46,610
I got 5.

3538
02:10:47,610 --> 02:10:47,990
Let's go.

3539
02:10:48,430 --> 02:10:50,510
I got 24 points.

3540
02:10:51,370 --> 02:10:52,730
Toki, you have 5 points?

3541
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:54,430
You have 5 points.

3542
02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:56,870
How many points do you have?

3543
02:10:57,470 --> 02:10:58,530
I have 10 points.

3544
02:10:58,770 --> 02:10:59,370
What the fuck?

3545
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:01,750
You've been lying to people.

3546
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:03,130
You've been lying.

3547
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:04,990
This guy is a liar.

3548
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:06,650
I haven't lied once.

3549
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:07,910
You should be proud of that.

3550
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:10,930
You should not be proud of having 10 points because you're a liar.

3551
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:12,630
I literally have not lied once.

3552
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:15,050
He's lying to us right now.

3553
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:15,690
He's lying to us.

3554
02:11:16,290 --> 02:11:17,890
He's not a good person because he's a liar.

3555
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:19,250
Is it true, Abe?

3556
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:20,790
People just don't trust you so you get a few points?

3557
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:22,270
Yeah, I have 10 points.

3558
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:23,050
I haven't lied once.

3559
02:11:23,890 --> 02:11:25,810
Everyone just trusts me.

3560
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:28,610
I have the inverse effect.

3561
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:30,030
No one fucking trusts me.

3562
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:31,950
That's for good reason, man.

3563
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:33,670
I'm not trusting you either.

3564
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:34,010
That's true.

3565
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:36,670
Oh shit.

3566
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:40,290
Are you a truther?

3567
02:11:41,230 --> 02:11:42,550
I am a truther actually.

3568
02:11:42,850 --> 02:11:45,070
I'm a firm believer that what we should do is...

3569
02:11:45,070 --> 02:11:47,110
Round 1, I'll tell you what I have.

3570
02:11:47,310 --> 02:11:47,710
Genuinely.

3571
02:11:48,190 --> 02:11:50,390
And you can win one and then you do the same.

3572
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:51,510
And I get to win one.

3573
02:11:51,690 --> 02:11:53,750
So first two rounds we don't play for real.

3574
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:55,290
And then the second two rounds we'll play for real.

3575
02:11:55,610 --> 02:11:56,350
That'll be fun.

3576
02:11:57,370 --> 02:11:58,810
I have skull this time.

3577
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:00,570
Yeah.

3578
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:01,490
Like this?

3579
02:12:02,130 --> 02:12:02,930
Yeah, perfect.

3580
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:05,410
And you wouldn't lie to me too, right?

3581
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:06,910
No, I'm not lying.

3582
02:12:07,770 --> 02:12:10,950
You'll be willing to do it because you're gonna know that I was truthing this whole time.

3583
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:12,290
I do have skull.

3584
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:13,170
100%.

3585
02:12:13,170 --> 02:12:14,610
Oh yeah, skull.

3586
02:12:14,850 --> 02:12:15,050
Okay.

3587
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:16,790
I trust you.

3588
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:19,850
You seem like you're a mind-trappler.

3589
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:21,770
I'm doing a lot of faith here.

3590
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:23,010
I'm trusting you preemptively.

3591
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:25,110
Oh, hey, you're right!

3592
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:26,450
What did I say?

3593
02:12:26,610 --> 02:12:27,690
I told you I was a truther.

3594
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:28,950
Yeah, you're such a truther.

3595
02:12:30,030 --> 02:12:32,150
I have a scroll.

3596
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:36,230
I knew trusting Minecraft players was the right idea.

3597
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:37,670
That's what I'm saying.

3598
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:38,850
I have a scroll.

3599
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:40,410
Okay, the scroll.

3600
02:12:40,570 --> 02:12:41,350
So I should go knife.

3601
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:42,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3602
02:12:42,970 --> 02:12:44,230
I would never lie to you.

3603
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:46,450
After we established our bonds.

3604
02:12:47,230 --> 02:12:50,670
Yeah, after I gave you that first one, surely we're gonna be...

3605
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:52,330
Like we just met, you don't know my character?

3606
02:12:53,290 --> 02:12:53,730
Yeah.

3607
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:55,110
Yeah, but I would never lie.

3608
02:12:55,330 --> 02:12:56,430
You gave me two points.

3609
02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:58,350
So why would I want another two points?

3610
02:12:59,310 --> 02:12:59,750
Yeah.

3611
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:02,050
Why would you not want to also give me two points?

3612
02:13:02,110 --> 02:13:02,710
Yeah, exactly.

3613
02:13:03,410 --> 02:13:04,170
That's kind of fair.

3614
02:13:04,930 --> 02:13:06,730
Yeah, that would be so fucked up.

3615
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:08,250
Then we can play for real, right?

3616
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:09,790
Yeah, and then we play for real.

3617
02:13:09,930 --> 02:13:14,250
It would be so fucked up if I just like yoinked two points off of you like that.

3618
02:13:14,670 --> 02:13:18,270
After I gave you that free two points.

3619
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:20,890
Like what kind of person am I to do that to you?

3620
02:13:21,290 --> 02:13:23,730
I would be heartbroken if that happened.

3621
02:13:24,230 --> 02:13:24,670
Yeah.

3622
02:13:24,670 --> 02:13:24,810
See?

3623
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:25,430
Look, see?

3624
02:13:25,570 --> 02:13:26,330
I told you.

3625
02:13:26,910 --> 02:13:28,890
I told you I was truthing.

3626
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:31,150
I would never fuck with you like that.

3627
02:13:31,790 --> 02:13:32,730
That's what I like to hear.

3628
02:13:33,410 --> 02:13:34,750
Okay, we're playing for real now?

3629
02:13:34,970 --> 02:13:35,370
Yeah, sure.

3630
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:37,630
Okay, I...

3631
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:39,910
Do you want me to tell you what I got still?

3632
02:13:40,270 --> 02:13:40,590
Sure.

3633
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:43,730
Okay, I did in fact get the paper.

3634
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:45,270
Oh, you got paper again?

3635
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:46,610
I did.

3636
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:48,350
What are the odds of that?

3637
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:50,490
I've actually had paper the last three times now.

3638
02:13:50,770 --> 02:13:52,290
You had paper the last three times?

3639
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:53,450
Wait, how many points do you have?

3640
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:54,650
Yeah, because I had paper round one with you, right?

3641
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:55,250
Yeah, yeah.

3642
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:58,630
Yeah, I had paper my last round against the other person as well.

3643
02:13:58,810 --> 02:14:01,290
Yeah, wait, how many rounds... how many points do you have?

3644
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:03,130
Oh, I'm at nine right now.

3645
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:04,330
You have nine points?

3646
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:05,030
Damn!

3647
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:05,730
Yeah, how many do you have?

3648
02:14:05,790 --> 02:14:07,590
Wait, that means people have been lying to you.

3649
02:14:08,710 --> 02:14:10,270
Yeah, people have been lying to me a bit.

3650
02:14:10,330 --> 02:14:11,210
That's so fucked up.

3651
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:12,630
Why would they lie to you like that?

3652
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:14,070
Ah, well, you know.

3653
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:14,970
People be lying.

3654
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:16,650
Yeah, you should get them banned.

3655
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,630
For lying.

3656
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:18,850
Get them banned?

3657
02:14:19,450 --> 02:14:21,150
Get them banned from the Minecraft event?

3658
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:22,910
They're liars.

3659
02:14:22,910 --> 02:14:24,050
Yeah, liars.

3660
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:24,770
Oh, hey!

3661
02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:26,130
Wait, you lied!

3662
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:28,310
I was close!

3663
02:14:28,850 --> 02:14:29,590
I was close!

3664
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:30,830
I wasn't even running!

3665
02:14:30,970 --> 02:14:31,410
I was close!

3666
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:33,330
Okay!

3667
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:35,010
Wait, so how many points do you have?

3668
02:14:35,170 --> 02:14:35,750
I have seven.

3669
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:37,290
Oh, you have seven.

3670
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:39,070
Okay, see, I'm at a comfortable ten right now.

3671
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:39,650
Yeah, yeah.

3672
02:14:40,270 --> 02:14:43,250
Okay, well, what did you get so I can give you these two points?

3673
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:44,270
I have a...

3674
02:14:44,830 --> 02:14:45,790
I have a knife.

3675
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:47,390
You have a knife?

3676
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:47,890
Oh, okay.

3677
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:50,750
Yeah.

3678
02:14:52,270 --> 02:14:52,630
Okay.

3679
02:14:54,670 --> 02:14:55,590
Okay, give me those two points.

3680
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:56,230
What happened?

3681
02:14:57,650 --> 02:14:58,090
Uh...

3682
02:14:58,090 --> 02:14:59,390
I mean...

3683
02:15:00,290 --> 02:15:02,430
I thought we were playing for real the last two rounds.

3684
02:15:02,450 --> 02:15:04,310
Yeah, but then you wanna lie to me?

3685
02:15:05,410 --> 02:15:05,850
Oh...

3686
02:15:06,710 --> 02:15:09,090
Oh... What's the thing that you love the most in life?

3687
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:10,930
Um...

3688
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:12,950
I don't know.

3689
02:15:13,670 --> 02:15:14,430
What's the thing?

3690
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:15,050
Living, I guess.

3691
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:16,930
Life is funny, you know?

3692
02:15:16,970 --> 02:15:17,730
Life is funny?

3693
02:15:18,490 --> 02:15:20,250
Yeah, it's a funny thing, you know?

3694
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:22,330
Well, I hope you're happy living in hell.

3695
02:15:23,210 --> 02:15:23,630
Oh...

3696
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:25,530
Oh, I'm drinking time!

3697
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:26,450
Oh, no!

3698
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:31,590
I hope you live with that guilt for the rest of your life.

3699
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:33,410
I thought you were lying, so then I...

3700
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:34,490
I'm gonna get your points.

3701
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:38,050
Sprint, sprint.

3702
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:39,610
I'm gonna get you, bro.

3703
02:15:39,710 --> 02:15:40,110
What's up?

3704
02:15:41,110 --> 02:15:45,830
Dude, you had my butt cheeks pucker in the whole time.

3705
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:46,590
I'm kidding.

3706
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:47,470
I have seven points.

3707
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:49,370
I have ten points.

3708
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:51,110
I got four points.

3709
02:15:51,370 --> 02:15:52,290
Okay, I need... I'm stressed out.

3710
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:52,290
I'm stressed out.

3711
02:15:52,330 --> 02:15:53,530
I need to start lying.

3712
02:15:53,570 --> 02:15:54,670
Dude, you're on a roll, man.

3713
02:15:55,570 --> 02:15:56,730
I got lied to again.

3714
02:15:56,890 --> 02:15:57,510
I got lied to.

3715
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:58,190
I got eight points.

3716
02:15:58,730 --> 02:15:59,630
I got seven points.

3717
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:04,030
I need to start lying.

3718
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:08,270
No, I need to start lying.

3719
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:08,350
No, I need to start lying.

3720
02:16:08,350 --> 02:16:09,930
Kumi, you've been telling the truth.

3721
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:12,550
Why the fuck have you been telling the truth?

3722
02:16:12,550 --> 02:16:13,130
You're losing.

3723
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:15,950
I've always been telling the... because I don't tell lies!

3724
02:16:16,670 --> 02:16:17,710
That's not true!

3725
02:16:17,770 --> 02:16:19,370
I don't tell lies!

3726
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:22,310
You literally lied to me 24x7.

3727
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:23,810
That's not true!

3728
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,810
You eat and sleep more and...

3729
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:26,590
That's not true!

3730
02:16:27,010 --> 02:16:28,850
I'm always a true thing!

3731
02:16:30,270 --> 02:16:32,170
I feel like I lost three for all the last...

3732
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:32,990
Yeah, me neither, man.

3733
02:16:33,710 --> 02:16:35,450
Wait, how many more games do we have left?

3734
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:37,370
I don't know.

3735
02:16:37,530 --> 02:16:37,950
Like two?

3736
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:38,730
Two?

3737
02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:39,130
Okay.

3738
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:41,590
Wait, how many do you have, Dokie?

3739
02:16:42,690 --> 02:16:43,790
Six, I think.

3740
02:16:44,050 --> 02:16:45,510
Don't, don't, don't trust...

3741
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:47,330
I got eight.

3742
02:16:47,710 --> 02:16:48,910
I got lied to.

3743
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:50,010
I got lied to by Iskall.

3744
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:50,890
And he's Swedish.

3745
02:16:52,470 --> 02:16:54,310
Wait, maybe he's a fake Swede.

3746
02:16:55,130 --> 02:16:55,490
Yeah.

3747
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:56,950
Yeah.

3748
02:16:56,970 --> 02:16:58,610
He was going well and then he lied to me.

3749
02:16:59,010 --> 02:16:59,810
That's fucked up.

3750
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:00,710
Why don't you lie too?

3751
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:05,030
I might have to head to my lying org.

3752
02:17:05,610 --> 02:17:06,730
You have to start lying.

3753
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:07,910
I gotta start lying too.

3754
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:08,650
You have to start lying.

3755
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:08,650
I gotta start lying too.

3756
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:08,790
You have to start lying.

3757
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:08,790
I gotta start lying too.

3758
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:11,690
Wait, Gumi, we get matched up.

3759
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:13,570
Like we have known each other for so long.

3760
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:14,470
Like you wouldn't lie to me, right?

3761
02:17:14,490 --> 02:17:15,690
Yeah, I would never lie to you.

3762
02:17:16,050 --> 02:17:16,530
Of course.

3763
02:17:16,530 --> 02:17:17,290
What if you're lying right now?

3764
02:17:17,530 --> 02:17:20,210
I got, I've been tricked because I've been telling the truth.

3765
02:17:20,610 --> 02:17:21,870
That's why seven points.

3766
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:22,790
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

3767
02:17:23,130 --> 02:17:30,270
No, it's bad because we were trading and he told me he had Skull and I said, okay, I like you, I'm gonna give you the win.

3768
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:32,850
And I picked Blade and then he goes, no, it'll be a tie.

3769
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:36,450
Dokie!

3770
02:17:36,610 --> 02:17:42,470
Hey, I've been having, no, I've been having a rough time because everybody's lying to me.

3771
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:43,910
I'm not a liar.

3772
02:17:44,070 --> 02:17:44,470
Are you sure?

3773
02:17:44,690 --> 02:17:45,090
I think you promised.

3774
02:17:45,350 --> 02:17:45,970
Are you sure?

3775
02:17:47,330 --> 02:17:50,370
I'm gonna tell you now that I got a knife.

3776
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:51,230
Okay.

3777
02:17:52,250 --> 02:17:55,650
I put a skull up and I'm like, I promise I'm not lying.

3778
02:17:55,870 --> 02:17:56,670
Are you sure?

3779
02:17:56,790 --> 02:17:59,990
Wait, how many points do you have?

3780
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:01,590
I got eight.

3781
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:02,450
You got eight?

3782
02:18:03,210 --> 02:18:06,410
I haven't been lying but I had two people lying then I got a draw.

3783
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:08,130
Yeah, I haven't been lying.

3784
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:11,430
I have three points because they all took advantage of my truth.

3785
02:18:11,690 --> 02:18:11,970
What?

3786
02:18:11,970 --> 02:18:11,970
Yeah.

3787
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:15,750
Everybody's been taking advantage of me.

3788
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:17,510
Don't worry, I won't be lying to you.

3789
02:18:17,510 --> 02:18:19,450
Because I haven't been lying at all.

3790
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:24,170
I don't lie at all either but I think that's kind of... Oh my god!

3791
02:18:24,210 --> 02:18:24,910
Thank you!

3792
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:26,770
Now I have five points!

3793
02:18:26,810 --> 02:18:26,850
I told you.

3794
02:18:27,030 --> 02:18:27,770
Thank you!

3795
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:29,050
That's so sweet of you.

3796
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:31,770
I got you.

3797
02:18:31,850 --> 02:18:32,750
Don't worry, I won't lie to you.

3798
02:18:32,810 --> 02:18:32,830
Oh my god.

3799
02:18:33,070 --> 02:18:33,430
Okay.

3800
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:35,670
Can I have another point?

3801
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:39,350
So I can stay in the game and then I'll give you the next two points.

3802
02:18:41,110 --> 02:18:41,510
Okay.

3803
02:18:41,510 --> 02:18:42,310
Yay!

3804
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:44,090
Um, paper.

3805
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:47,110
Oh...

3806
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:48,370
Then I need to do school.

3807
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:49,250
Yeah.

3808
02:18:49,590 --> 02:18:50,250
Thank you!

3809
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:53,570
I almost did paper again and gave it a draw but...

3810
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:55,930
That's so sweet.

3811
02:18:56,010 --> 02:18:57,710
I'll give you the points for the next one.

3812
02:18:58,050 --> 02:18:58,970
And then we should...

3813
02:18:58,970 --> 02:19:00,270
I would never!

3814
02:19:00,890 --> 02:19:01,950
No, I didn't!

3815
02:19:02,430 --> 02:19:05,070
I'm just saying if you do... I think I have paper.

3816
02:19:05,190 --> 02:19:06,310
Wait, let me double check again.

3817
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:07,450
Yeah, I have paper.

3818
02:19:08,190 --> 02:19:09,270
I'm very forgetful too.

3819
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:10,590
I've been lying later on after this round.

3820
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:10,890
No, no.

3821
02:19:12,330 --> 02:19:13,110
I will never.

3822
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:13,710
I will never lie to you.

3823
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:14,790
I'm scared.

3824
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:16,990
No, that's why I have three points!

3825
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:19,810
Because people took advantage of my kindness!

3826
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:23,930
I thought I had an alliance and then they abused it.

3827
02:19:24,950 --> 02:19:25,430
See?

3828
02:19:28,390 --> 02:19:28,870
Okay.

3829
02:19:29,070 --> 02:19:29,910
I mean like this round.

3830
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:30,650
Oh yeah, yeah.

3831
02:19:30,670 --> 02:19:31,070
This round.

3832
02:19:31,430 --> 02:19:33,570
Uh, what do you have?

3833
02:19:34,050 --> 02:19:34,850
I got skull.

3834
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:35,990
Look, see?

3835
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:37,830
I never lied to you.

3836
02:19:37,890 --> 02:19:38,790
You gave me four points.

3837
02:19:39,850 --> 02:19:40,670
Oh, it did?

3838
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:41,190
Nice!

3839
02:19:41,530 --> 02:19:41,970
Yeah!

3840
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:43,670
I was trying to tell people earlier.

3841
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:46,190
I was like, you get more points if we just do that back and forth.

3842
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:46,190
We're together.

3843
02:19:46,590 --> 02:19:47,050
I know!

3844
02:19:47,370 --> 02:19:49,930
Like, I don't understand why people don't work together.

3845
02:19:51,370 --> 02:19:52,650
Like, it's so messed up.

3846
02:19:52,710 --> 02:19:53,290
It's Minecraft.

3847
02:19:53,450 --> 02:19:55,730
I thought Minecraft was all about like working.

3848
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:59,150
Like, we're not even allowed to swear in Minecraft and people are lying?

3849
02:19:59,710 --> 02:20:00,950
Like, we're not even allowed to swear in Minecraft and people are lying?

3850
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:01,650
Yeah, what do they think?

3851
02:20:01,710 --> 02:20:02,430
This is Among Us?

3852
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:02,970
Yeah!

3853
02:20:03,210 --> 02:20:04,730
This is a Christian server.

3854
02:20:07,610 --> 02:20:08,770
God will not let you win!

3855
02:20:08,770 --> 02:20:09,690
This is not like this!

3856
02:20:12,610 --> 02:20:14,290
So the next one, do you wanna...

3857
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:15,750
Would you rather just do like...

3858
02:20:16,470 --> 02:20:18,650
Like a wrong one rather than a plus four?

3859
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:20,890
Yeah, we could just do like...

3860
02:20:20,890 --> 02:20:21,910
Wait, what do you mean by that?

3861
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:24,230
You said plus... Oh no, no, no.

3862
02:20:24,330 --> 02:20:24,990
This is plus two.

3863
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:25,650
Okay, never mind.

3864
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:27,630
I misunderstood the point system.

3865
02:20:27,970 --> 02:20:28,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3866
02:20:30,010 --> 02:20:30,610
Shut up.

3867
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:31,410
Wait, is that the...

3868
02:20:31,410 --> 02:20:33,190
That's the last round, right?

3869
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:34,650
Yes.

3870
02:20:34,650 --> 02:20:38,370
Oh, can I have two more points so I can not get eliminated?

3871
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:39,910
Yeah.

3872
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:40,770
Yay!

3873
02:20:42,130 --> 02:20:42,930
What do you want?

3874
02:20:44,250 --> 02:20:46,150
I am Blade.

3875
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:52,100
Yay!

3876
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:53,320
You're so nice.

3877
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:57,200
Oh my god, you have been the nicest person I've like bumped into.

3878
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:58,060
I told you, I won't lie to you.

3879
02:20:58,220 --> 02:20:59,060
That's so sweet!

3880
02:20:59,220 --> 02:21:02,100
I can't believe other people were taking advantage of your kindness!

3881
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:04,180
I know, right?

3882
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:05,420
That's so messed up!

3883
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,140
I bet those people...

3884
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:08,140
They're gonna go to hell.

3885
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:11,520
Especially on Minecraft.

3886
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:14,680
I know, especially on this Christian Minecraft survey.

3887
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:18,360
You know they're never gonna win that $70,000.

3888
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:19,620
You know?

3889
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:22,540
You're taking it so seriously.

3890
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:23,240
I need that.

3891
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:26,560
Oh my god, thank you!

3892
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:29,400
Is that the last one?

3893
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,620
Or do we have another one?

3894
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,420
No, that was definitely the last one.

3895
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:33,180
Yay!

3896
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:35,000
That's so easy.

3897
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:38,220
Oh my god!

3898
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:40,640
Guys, I got 13 points!

3899
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:42,280
I got 12!

3900
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:43,560
I got 13!

3901
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:45,580
Mendo, how many you got?

3902
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:47,260
I'm chillin', bro.

3903
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:50,700
Mendo, bro, you gotta step it up.

3904
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:52,580
I can't lie!

3905
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:53,840
They'll feel bad if I lie!

3906
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:56,340
You have to like take it.

3907
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:58,600
I can't!

3908
02:21:58,700 --> 02:22:01,920
Oh my god, this isn't my new track, Guilt Tripping.

3909
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:04,180
Who said that?

3910
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:04,840
Who said that?

3911
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:07,880
My new trick.

3912
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:09,560
Mendo, I can't lie either, bro.

3913
02:22:09,580 --> 02:22:10,160
I can't do it.

3914
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,180
What's your points, Abe?

3915
02:22:13,980 --> 02:22:14,380
14!

3916
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:17,400
What's your points?

3917
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:18,320
What points do you have?

3918
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:19,920
I can't take that away from you, man.

3919
02:22:21,660 --> 02:22:23,060
You have 19?

3920
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:28,260
Oh my god.

3921
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:29,720
I can't even hear you.

3922
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:30,540
You're so loud.

3923
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:31,740
I suck at my spice.

3924
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:32,660
Nooooo.

3925
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:36,100
I can't believe it, guys.

3926
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:37,320
I can't believe it.

3927
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:40,360
I got 13 points, guys.

3928
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:41,780
I might be safe.

3929
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:43,320
Maybe...

3930
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:44,500
Wait, is this the last game?

3931
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:47,700
Yeah, I think it's one round left.

3932
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:50,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3933
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:51,220
What if it's us two?

3934
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:54,020
How many points do you have?

3935
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:55,140
That guy has 20!

3936
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:57,360
14, I have 13.

3937
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:58,960
I think we could be eliminated.

3938
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,560
I think we might... I think we're...

3939
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:03,580
I think we're fucked.

3940
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:04,520
No, I'm sorry.

3941
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:06,380
No, no, no, surely not.

3942
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:07,680
I think we're fucked.

3943
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:09,660
That's not a lot of points.

3944
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:10,920
13's not a lot.

3945
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:14,940
I'm sorry for lying, though.

3946
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:15,240
14!

3947
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:18,680
Guys, I'm scared.

3948
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:21,700
I got taken advantage in the beginning.

3949
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:23,520
So then I took advantage of somebody else.

3950
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:26,960
But now, like, I feel like we're not gonna be able to make it, guys.

3951
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:27,380
Guys...

3952
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:29,960
Alright, Doki, good luck!

3953
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:32,100
Good luck, good luck, good luck, guys!

3954
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:32,840
Good luck!

3955
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:37,190
Hi, Doki.

3956
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:38,950
Hey, are you a truther?

3957
02:23:40,170 --> 02:23:42,650
I have been truthful with everyone I've played against.

3958
02:23:42,730 --> 02:23:43,090
Really?

3959
02:23:43,590 --> 02:23:45,090
How many points do you have?

3960
02:23:46,130 --> 02:23:46,950
I have 15.

3961
02:23:47,190 --> 02:23:47,670
15?

3962
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:49,030
I have 6.

3963
02:23:50,950 --> 02:23:52,690
I've been truthful with some people.

3964
02:23:52,870 --> 02:23:55,450
No, I've been... people have been taking advantage of me.

3965
02:23:57,050 --> 02:23:58,530
Because I've been telling the truth.

3966
02:23:58,530 --> 02:23:58,750
You're a truther?

3967
02:23:59,090 --> 02:23:59,490
Yeah!

3968
02:24:00,530 --> 02:24:03,010
I got, like, squid in the first game.

3969
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:04,910
And then he, like, took advantage of me.

3970
02:24:04,970 --> 02:24:06,250
And then I got some other guy.

3971
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:07,990
With, like, a creeper thing.

3972
02:24:08,210 --> 02:24:09,070
A creeper skin.

3973
02:24:09,290 --> 02:24:12,630
And then he also, like, made me lose almost everybody.

3974
02:24:13,910 --> 02:24:14,630
So, like...

3975
02:24:14,630 --> 02:24:14,870
What do you have?

3976
02:24:15,250 --> 02:24:17,810
I have... I have a skull.

3977
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:19,810
You have a skull?

3978
02:24:20,010 --> 02:24:20,290
Yeah.

3979
02:24:21,770 --> 02:24:23,070
Oh my god, thank you!

3980
02:24:24,850 --> 02:24:26,350
This is the way I've been doing it with everyone.

3981
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,670
I give them the first win.

3982
02:24:28,530 --> 02:24:29,170
And then I go back and forth.

3983
02:24:29,370 --> 02:24:32,570
You don't have to, but that's the way I've been doing it.

3984
02:24:32,710 --> 02:24:34,470
Wait, can I have another point, though?

3985
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:36,410
Because I might get eliminated.

3986
02:24:39,250 --> 02:24:39,650
Sure.

3987
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:40,750
Yay!

3988
02:24:41,210 --> 02:24:41,830
Thank you!

3989
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:44,190
I have a knife.

3990
02:24:44,650 --> 02:24:45,050
Knife?

3991
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:45,510
Okay.

3992
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:48,330
Oh, you put the skull.

3993
02:24:48,750 --> 02:24:49,850
You wouldn't lie, right?

3994
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:52,290
Have you been telling the truth?

3995
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:52,910
I have not lied a single time.

3996
02:24:53,050 --> 02:24:54,230
You haven't lied a single time?

3997
02:24:54,390 --> 02:24:54,730
Oh, okay.

3998
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:57,630
You said you went against the creeper skin?

3999
02:24:57,770 --> 02:24:57,930
Was that sad?

4000
02:24:58,530 --> 02:24:59,150
They lied to me.

4001
02:25:00,050 --> 02:25:00,930
They kept lying.

4002
02:25:01,070 --> 02:25:05,150
Because they told the truth for the first two rounds.

4003
02:25:05,610 --> 02:25:09,430
And then they told lies in the last two rounds to me.

4004
02:25:10,350 --> 02:25:10,450
And then they told lies in the last two rounds to me.

4005
02:25:10,450 --> 02:25:10,690
And then they told lies in the last two rounds to me.

4006
02:25:10,690 --> 02:25:11,670
So then they won.

4007
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:14,250
So they took advantage.

4008
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:19,810
Because they were like, Because they were like, Oh, I'm going to tell the truth the entire time.

4009
02:25:19,870 --> 02:25:20,270
He was like, really?

4010
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:21,690
So then I just trusted him.

4011
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:22,710
Thank you!

4012
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:26,970
Alright, I'll let you win the next one.

4013
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:27,210
Alright, I'll let you win the next one.

4014
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:28,730
Alright.

4015
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:36,590
See, I thought in the last game, this is where we were going to start seeing the real sides of people.

4016
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:37,170
The real sides?

4017
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:38,890
But you wouldn't lie though.

4018
02:25:40,050 --> 02:25:40,490
Yeah.

4019
02:25:40,490 --> 02:25:40,850
I wouldn't.

4020
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,290
I have.

4021
02:25:41,490 --> 02:25:44,150
So can the last round, can I have the two points then?

4022
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:46,870
So you get six, I get two?

4023
02:25:47,150 --> 02:25:47,590
Yeah.

4024
02:25:48,290 --> 02:25:50,330
Because you're in a comfortable place, aren't you?

4025
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:52,510
I don't know.

4026
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:53,750
Wait, what's your points?

4027
02:25:55,650 --> 02:25:56,710
Well, I had...

4028
02:25:56,710 --> 02:25:57,410
I've got 15.

4029
02:25:58,530 --> 02:25:58,610
Oh!

4030
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:00,650
Yeah, no, you're comfortable.

4031
02:26:01,590 --> 02:26:06,050
I saw her, like some people, I heard it was like 12 and like 7.

4032
02:26:07,050 --> 02:26:08,350
So I think you're in a comfortable place.

4033
02:26:08,810 --> 02:26:09,450
I have a knife.

4034
02:26:10,430 --> 02:26:11,130
You have a knife?

4035
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:11,410
Okay.

4036
02:26:11,550 --> 02:26:12,610
Yeah, and I'm telling the truth.

4037
02:26:13,770 --> 02:26:14,490
I believe you.

4038
02:26:14,730 --> 02:26:16,770
Yeah, because you've been telling the truth this entire time.

4039
02:26:19,030 --> 02:26:23,050
I wonder though, how many people are going to do kind of what we're doing right now.

4040
02:26:23,250 --> 02:26:24,470
What, like exchanging stuff?

4041
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:25,870
Yeah.

4042
02:26:26,470 --> 02:26:28,170
So it all kind of levels out at the end.

4043
02:26:28,530 --> 02:26:28,670
Yeah.

4044
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:31,530
Oh, I know like there's some people with like 7 points.

4045
02:26:32,170 --> 02:26:34,450
So I think you should be fine.

4046
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:38,330
That means there's got to be people with like 25, right?

4047
02:26:38,710 --> 02:26:40,410
I think the highest I heard was 20.

4048
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:42,890
Alright, what do you have?

4049
02:26:43,070 --> 02:26:43,910
Even that's still insane.

4050
02:26:44,810 --> 02:26:45,330
I've got...

4051
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:47,330
So are you okay if I take the last two points?

4052
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:49,010
I'm fine with that.

4053
02:26:49,210 --> 02:26:50,250
Oh, okay, thank you.

4054
02:26:51,850 --> 02:26:52,650
What do you have?

4055
02:26:53,890 --> 02:26:54,290
Paper.

4056
02:26:54,290 --> 02:26:54,890
Paper?

4057
02:26:55,850 --> 02:26:56,330
Bye.

4058
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:02,010
Did you ever play or did you ever watch uh... Splitter Steel?

4059
02:27:02,490 --> 02:27:03,210
Splitter Steel?

4060
02:27:03,970 --> 02:27:04,790
Wait, what's that?

4061
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:09,950
Like any game shows where two people have to decide whether they like...

4062
02:27:09,950 --> 02:27:11,150
if they're given like money.

4063
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:18,630
Oh, and then like you're like, oh if you pick the money up then you'll lose it for everybody like type deal.

4064
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:19,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4065
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:23,690
I never thought I'd be doing that in real life.

4066
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:24,030
I know.

4067
02:27:24,290 --> 02:27:24,850
It's actually crazy.

4068
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:26,450
I can't believe people are liars still.

4069
02:27:26,690 --> 02:27:27,930
Thank you so much for the points.

4070
02:27:28,010 --> 02:27:29,010
I really appreciate it.

4071
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:29,490
How many do you have?

4072
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:31,870
I have... I think I have...

4073
02:27:31,870 --> 02:27:33,070
You lost 15 minutes.

4074
02:27:36,130 --> 02:27:36,890
Guilt tripping.

4075
02:27:37,810 --> 02:27:38,970
I got eliminated!

4076
02:27:40,470 --> 02:27:41,850
You got eliminated?

4077
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:42,870
How many points do you have?

4078
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:44,010
No!

4079
02:27:46,330 --> 02:27:47,770
No way, no way!

4080
02:27:48,110 --> 02:27:48,890
Everyone's dead!

4081
02:27:49,530 --> 02:27:51,010
Wait, Sleepy, you got eliminated!

4082
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:53,330
Sleepy, you got eliminated!

4083
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:54,730
I told you, bro.

4084
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:56,270
It's Lindo.

4085
02:27:59,830 --> 02:28:01,750
I can't lie to them, man.

4086
02:28:01,750 --> 02:28:02,610
I can't.

4087
02:28:02,610 --> 02:28:03,630
I can't lie to them, man.

4088
02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:03,630
I can't.

4089
02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:04,490
It's all thanks to you.

4090
02:28:05,090 --> 02:28:05,610
What?

4091
02:28:05,790 --> 02:28:06,750
I didn't do nothing.

4092
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:08,570
How many points did you get?

4093
02:28:09,370 --> 02:28:09,890
Oh...

4094
02:28:09,890 --> 02:28:11,150
That is actually...

4095
02:28:11,150 --> 02:28:12,350
That is evil!

4096
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:14,370
You're actually the villain, though.

4097
02:28:14,770 --> 02:28:15,530
I got eliminated.

4098
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:16,990
I got eliminated.

4099
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:18,130
I appreciate you.

4100
02:28:20,210 --> 02:28:20,950
No, please.

4101
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:23,350
Sir, EROB lives!

4102
02:28:23,910 --> 02:28:25,290
For the next days!

4103
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:28,590
Mendo, you have to EROB!

4104
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:29,570
He's coming.

4105
02:28:30,630 --> 02:28:34,430
Oh, yeah, no, I- I touched you.

4106
02:28:34,550 --> 02:28:37,310
Oh, my god.

4107
02:28:37,650 --> 02:28:39,330
I can't believe it.

4108
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:41,290
One more letter, Mendo?

4109
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:42,430
Are you okay?

4110
02:28:42,850 --> 02:28:43,970
Are you okay, man?

4111
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:47,510
Mendo, we went down together!

4112
02:28:48,570 --> 02:28:50,590
I trusted you, Sleepy!

4113
02:28:50,950 --> 02:28:51,750
And we did it!

4114
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:52,830
We did it!

4115
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:54,350
But it wasn't enough, man!

4116
02:28:59,350 --> 02:29:01,250
I can't believe it.

4117
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:02,770
I can't believe it.

4118
02:29:03,130 --> 02:29:05,230
I made it to the next stage!

4119
02:29:07,610 --> 02:29:10,090
Guys, alright, turn off emote mode only.

4120
02:29:10,110 --> 02:29:11,490
Turn off emote mode.

4121
02:29:12,810 --> 02:29:16,130
We were six points away from getting it.

4122
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:22,490
Oh my god.

4123
02:29:24,710 --> 02:29:28,870
Guys, if all else fails, it's guilt tripping time.

4124
02:29:33,310 --> 02:29:35,190
That was evil.

4125
02:29:38,630 --> 02:29:39,970
How is that even?

4126
02:29:41,470 --> 02:29:42,910
I made it through.

4127
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:48,010
You're so going to hell.

4128
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:50,830
Guys, I made it!

4129
02:29:51,570 --> 02:29:52,710
Let's fucking go!

4130
02:29:53,730 --> 02:29:57,770
I made it to the next round.

4131
02:29:58,610 --> 02:30:00,530
People gave me free points.

4132
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:02,770
And I survived.

4133
02:30:10,990 --> 02:30:11,890
Let's do it.

4134
02:30:12,730 --> 02:30:14,830
Why would they scare me like that?

4135
02:30:15,350 --> 02:30:15,810
I'm dead.

4136
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:17,770
I just gave you a twin.

4137
02:30:17,770 --> 02:30:18,470
I just gave you a twin.

4138
02:30:18,490 --> 02:30:18,950
I won, bro.

4139
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:20,410
Look, I just lied.

4140
02:30:20,470 --> 02:30:22,170
It was just a little white lie.

4141
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:23,110
Guys.

4142
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:26,810
Just a little white lie.

4143
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:30,070
Oh my god.

4144
02:30:31,510 --> 02:30:31,990
Yeah!

4145
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:34,730
How many points did you get again?

4146
02:30:35,690 --> 02:30:36,170
18.

4147
02:30:36,470 --> 02:30:37,170
I got 19.

4148
02:30:38,390 --> 02:30:39,050
Oh my god.

4149
02:30:39,590 --> 02:30:40,670
Yeah, you know how I did it?

4150
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:42,670
I guilt tripped it.

4151
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:44,970
I was like, I only have three points.

4152
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:48,530
Can I please have some points so I can stay in the round a little longer?

4153
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:49,110
Oh my god.

4154
02:30:49,110 --> 02:30:50,270
So you did lie.

4155
02:30:50,770 --> 02:30:52,990
And then they gave me three rounds.

4156
02:30:53,390 --> 02:30:55,510
Both players gave me three rounds.

4157
02:30:56,050 --> 02:30:56,830
Did you die?

4158
02:30:56,970 --> 02:30:57,850
Did those players die?

4159
02:30:58,230 --> 02:30:58,730
No, no.

4160
02:30:58,770 --> 02:30:59,650
They didn't die.

4161
02:31:00,630 --> 02:31:02,090
Because they were already comfortable.

4162
02:31:03,270 --> 02:31:04,530
They were already comfortable.

4163
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:07,090
So I was like, hey, you guys are going to make it anyway.

4164
02:31:07,330 --> 02:31:09,550
So like, can I have the three rounds?

4165
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:10,830
I only have three points.

4166
02:31:11,170 --> 02:31:11,610
Oh my god.

4167
02:31:12,150 --> 02:31:12,590
Oh my god.

4168
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:15,250
No, no, no.

4169
02:31:15,250 --> 02:31:15,710
I'm with you.

4170
02:31:15,790 --> 02:31:16,430
A lot of my friends lived.

4171
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:17,410
Oh, nice.

4172
02:31:17,410 --> 02:31:19,410
I guess we're living to the next day.

4173
02:31:20,570 --> 02:31:21,650
Oh my god, Badoki.

4174
02:31:21,970 --> 02:31:22,370
Yeah?

4175
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:23,150
I feel so bad.

4176
02:31:23,290 --> 02:31:24,870
I lied to one person.

4177
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:25,890
But who did you lie to?

4178
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:26,770
One point I lost.

4179
02:31:29,350 --> 02:31:32,030
There was a person who lied to me first.

4180
02:31:32,110 --> 02:31:32,670
And I was like, oh.

4181
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:35,070
I want to go see who lost the last round.

4182
02:31:35,890 --> 02:31:38,050
And then I just lied to them at the last round.

4183
02:31:38,230 --> 02:31:39,630
Oh, they deserve it.

4184
02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:40,230
They deserve it.

4185
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:40,690
We made it.

4186
02:31:40,770 --> 02:31:41,630
They deserve it.

4187
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:44,990
I thought it was funny that Mendo and Sleepy got kicked.

4188
02:31:46,210 --> 02:31:46,910
I know.

4189
02:31:46,990 --> 02:31:47,590
That's crazy.

4190
02:31:47,770 --> 02:31:48,770
I would have won.

4191
02:31:49,090 --> 02:31:52,690
Sleepy was so cocky too earlier.

4192
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:54,610
He was like, I got the point.

4193
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:56,590
Yeah.

4194
02:31:58,850 --> 02:32:01,290
I thought Sleepy was in for sure.

4195
02:32:01,630 --> 02:32:02,210
Yeah, me too.

4196
02:32:02,310 --> 02:32:04,230
I was not expecting his elimination.

4197
02:32:06,190 --> 02:32:06,850
Oh my.

4198
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:07,590
Wait, what's the now?

4199
02:32:07,650 --> 02:32:08,890
It's time to decide your future.

4200
02:32:09,230 --> 02:32:10,210
What the fuck is that?

4201
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:12,010
Dave got eliminated.

4202
02:32:12,390 --> 02:32:12,850
I don't know.

4203
02:32:13,910 --> 02:32:14,970
I wonder what that is.

4204
02:32:15,470 --> 02:32:16,270
Hi, Dave.

4205
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:17,530
How many points did you end up with?

4206
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:18,570
Yeah, how many points did you have?

4207
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:19,950
You didn't save Mendo.

4208
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:21,150
Oh.

4209
02:32:22,130 --> 02:32:22,810
Okay, whatever.

4210
02:32:22,970 --> 02:32:23,130
I'm going to win.

4211
02:32:23,410 --> 02:32:24,870
You didn't even save Mendo.

4212
02:32:29,010 --> 02:32:30,230
Oh, we woke up.

4213
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:32,670
We woke up.

4214
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:33,530
M, did you make it?

4215
02:32:33,850 --> 02:32:34,790
I did make it.

4216
02:32:34,850 --> 02:32:35,510
How many points did you get?

4217
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:37,970
Use this to talk to other contestants.

4218
02:32:39,190 --> 02:32:39,190
Let's go.

4219
02:32:39,210 --> 02:32:39,870
We made it.

4220
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:40,750
Let's go.

4221
02:32:41,890 --> 02:32:43,090
Last Easter egg.

4222
02:32:43,090 --> 02:32:43,690
Where is it?

4223
02:32:43,950 --> 02:32:44,350
Yay.

4224
02:32:45,730 --> 02:32:46,870
Find the last one.

4225
02:32:46,870 --> 02:32:47,530
We did it.

4226
02:32:47,530 --> 02:32:51,270
You see, people lie but rock what they had.

4227
02:32:51,430 --> 02:32:53,730
Skull, blade or paper or scroll.

4228
02:32:54,150 --> 02:32:57,410
I am at another level of lying.

4229
02:33:02,770 --> 02:33:05,310
I was at a different level.

4230
02:33:11,470 --> 02:33:14,190
Very evil yet very cool.

4231
02:33:15,850 --> 02:33:19,010
Nobody thought about lying to pull out the points.

4232
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:29,450
I'm not going out day one.

4233
02:33:29,630 --> 02:33:30,670
I'm not going out day one.

4234
02:33:33,970 --> 02:33:35,670
No, I traded a bunch of them.

4235
02:33:35,770 --> 02:33:37,150
I had one round where I destroyed the game.

4236
02:33:39,230 --> 02:33:40,550
It's just twisted truth.

4237
02:33:40,810 --> 02:33:42,290
You traded all the way until the last one.

4238
02:33:42,290 --> 02:33:44,390
The last one was the person who lied to me.

4239
02:33:44,490 --> 02:33:48,530
Yeah, with everyone I was doing the first two we traded to each get two points.

4240
02:33:48,670 --> 02:33:50,050
This guy lied to me.

4241
02:33:50,110 --> 02:33:51,290
We can keep trading.

4242
02:33:51,410 --> 02:33:53,830
Yeah, he lied to me.

4243
02:33:53,950 --> 02:33:55,010
You lied to me?

4244
02:33:55,350 --> 02:33:56,310
I did not.

4245
02:33:56,610 --> 02:33:57,090
Yeah.

4246
02:33:59,590 --> 02:34:00,550
He did.

4247
02:34:00,770 --> 02:34:01,910
I hope you feel guilty.

4248
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:02,710
I traded one though.

4249
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:03,630
We traded the first two.

4250
02:34:04,210 --> 02:34:06,310
And then the last two we played for real.

4251
02:34:06,590 --> 02:34:07,990
Yeah, but then you lied.

4252
02:34:09,970 --> 02:34:11,130
We were playing for real.

4253
02:34:12,290 --> 02:34:12,910
The game is the lie.

4254
02:34:14,210 --> 02:34:14,690
Yeah.

4255
02:34:16,110 --> 02:34:19,730
Yeah, and the way I played the game was I was a truthful person.

4256
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:22,430
Yeah, and you almost lost.

4257
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:23,490
You started lying.

4258
02:34:25,010 --> 02:34:27,930
Yeah, he caused my joker arc.

4259
02:34:28,170 --> 02:34:29,850
I was a truthful person.

4260
02:34:30,190 --> 02:34:31,470
He corrupted me.

4261
02:34:32,610 --> 02:34:35,610
I was a truther until he corrupted me.

4262
02:34:35,690 --> 02:34:36,890
So I had to start lying.

4263
02:34:38,010 --> 02:34:40,130
I had to start guilt tripping people.

4264
02:34:40,390 --> 02:34:41,230
You had to do it.

4265
02:34:41,290 --> 02:34:41,590
You had to do it.

4266
02:34:42,290 --> 02:34:43,390
No other choice.

4267
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:45,470
My joker arc started it.

4268
02:34:46,110 --> 02:34:47,590
Oh, do not leave the server.

4269
02:34:47,790 --> 02:34:49,050
What are we supposed to do?

4270
02:34:50,850 --> 02:34:53,410
Yeah, I used to be a very trustworthy person.

4271
02:34:53,850 --> 02:34:55,610
And now people...

4272
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:56,810
Now I have to lie.

4273
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:58,170
No.

4274
02:35:00,130 --> 02:35:00,570
Yeah.

4275
02:35:01,930 --> 02:35:03,790
What do we even get for the Easter eggs?

4276
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:05,610
I don't know.

4277
02:35:05,630 --> 02:35:08,930
What if you get a total drama island thing where you don't get kicked out?

4278
02:35:08,930 --> 02:35:10,810
Oh, like if you get all ten...

4279
02:35:10,810 --> 02:35:12,710
Yeah, but then everybody's gonna try and get ten then.

4280
02:35:12,850 --> 02:35:14,450
And then they can't kick out anyone after.

4281
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:16,770
Yeah, but not everyone.

4282
02:35:16,850 --> 02:35:17,950
Look, you didn't try and get ten.

4283
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:19,970
Yeah, but like now I'm going to try.

4284
02:35:20,130 --> 02:35:21,730
We have six days of this.

4285
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:26,830
And the server...

4286
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:29,230
And the server is like up like an hour...

4287
02:35:29,230 --> 02:35:31,530
Like more than an hour before the event starts too.

4288
02:35:33,310 --> 02:35:36,330
Because I logged into the server at like 11.

4289
02:35:36,330 --> 02:35:36,930
Yeah.

4290
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:40,430
Wait, where are you?

4291
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:41,110
I lost you.

4292
02:35:41,430 --> 02:35:42,530
I'm right behind you, man.

4293
02:35:42,670 --> 02:35:43,550
Oh, what the heck?

4294
02:35:43,610 --> 02:35:44,490
You're camouflaged.

4295
02:35:47,250 --> 02:35:48,970
I don't think there's any eggs here.

4296
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:51,090
There's one over here.

4297
02:35:51,210 --> 02:35:51,930
Follow me though, Keith.

4298
02:35:51,950 --> 02:35:52,270
Oh, okay.

4299
02:35:53,150 --> 02:35:54,050
I only have one.

4300
02:35:54,270 --> 02:35:55,770
I haven't been paying attention.

4301
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:56,190
Where's the call room?

4302
02:35:57,950 --> 02:36:00,210
Well, I could get eliminated tomorrow, chat.

4303
02:36:01,610 --> 02:36:04,770
The thing is, you can get eliminated at any day.

4304
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:05,230
Oh my god, yeah.

4305
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:05,870
Yeah, right?

4306
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:06,310
Yeah.

4307
02:36:06,330 --> 02:36:07,610
Is there an egg here, guys?

4308
02:36:07,810 --> 02:36:08,870
Yeah, there should be, right?

4309
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:10,190
Oh, there it is.

4310
02:36:10,410 --> 02:36:11,210
Wait, where is it?

4311
02:36:12,570 --> 02:36:15,350
Does anybody know where the tenth egg is?

4312
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:15,690
What?

4313
02:36:16,910 --> 02:36:18,010
Stand where I am.

4314
02:36:18,090 --> 02:36:18,610
Stand where I am.

4315
02:36:18,810 --> 02:36:22,870
Stand where I am and then up.

4316
02:36:24,870 --> 02:36:25,570
Oh, snap.

4317
02:36:25,730 --> 02:36:27,890
They're selecting people for tie breakers.

4318
02:36:27,890 --> 02:36:28,550
Jump, Doki.

4319
02:36:28,570 --> 02:36:28,970
Jump.

4320
02:36:29,490 --> 02:36:30,430
Oh, I got it.

4321
02:36:30,510 --> 02:36:30,810
I got it.

4322
02:36:31,750 --> 02:36:34,150
Wait, there's tie breakers?

4323
02:36:34,170 --> 02:36:34,490
It's right here.

4324
02:36:34,490 --> 02:36:34,790
It's right here.

4325
02:36:36,330 --> 02:36:39,070
Apparently people tie it with coins and then they're gonna duke it out.

4326
02:36:39,490 --> 02:36:40,310
Wait, is it like a...

4327
02:36:41,190 --> 02:36:42,310
Wait, how do we...

4328
02:36:42,850 --> 02:36:44,290
How do we like find it?

4329
02:36:44,390 --> 02:36:44,790
Oh, yeah.

4330
02:36:44,850 --> 02:36:45,390
I hit that one.

4331
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:51,700
Oh, I had 19 points.

4332
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:53,340
So like...

4333
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:54,140
No, no, no.

4334
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:56,760
Tie breakers are for the people who weren't in our room.

4335
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:57,600
Oh!

4336
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:00,020
Wait.

4337
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:01,900
Our room was the only one with no tie breaker.

4338
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:02,780
Oh, nice.

4339
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:04,360
Nice.

4340
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:07,500
There's two in this room, Doki.

4341
02:37:08,220 --> 02:37:08,620
Oh, okay.

4342
02:37:11,820 --> 02:37:12,220
Where?

4343
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:14,120
There is a TV over there.

4344
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:14,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4345
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:15,380
I see it.

4346
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,720
Wait, have you found all 10 already?

4347
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:19,200
No, no, no.

4348
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:20,140
I only found 8.

4349
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:20,840
Oh my...

4350
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:23,420
And then there's another one over here.

4351
02:37:23,860 --> 02:37:25,120
Okay, I have three.

4352
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:28,900
I wonder if we can watch the tie breaker.

4353
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:30,220
I'm gonna be real.

4354
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:32,780
I know Dr. Gluon is like...

4355
02:37:33,580 --> 02:37:34,180
I mean...

4356
02:37:34,700 --> 02:37:35,920
We're not allowed to leave yet.

4357
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:37,560
We should be allowed to watch the tie breaker.

4358
02:37:37,560 --> 02:37:37,920
Oh, chat.

4359
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:39,560
I don't think I have any more.

4360
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:42,000
Well, you're allowed to, Chris.

4361
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:43,820
If you watch the stream.

4362
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:46,980
Wait, we can't watch the tie breaker.

4363
02:37:46,980 --> 02:37:47,360
Wait, we can't watch the tie breaker.

4364
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:49,120
Oh, we're over.

4365
02:37:49,340 --> 02:37:50,080
How many points did you have?

4366
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:51,520
I had 16.

4367
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:55,500
I almost got somebody eliminated though.

4368
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:56,760
Because they were like, what?

4369
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:57,700
17 or something?

4370
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:02,160
They literally just...

4371
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:02,520
They literally just...

4372
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:03,060
Pat lived.

4373
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:04,720
Oh my god.

4374
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:05,380
I'm nervous.

4375
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:06,920
How did we do this?

4376
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:10,580
I could have let them die.

4377
02:38:11,140 --> 02:38:11,920
I could have let them die.

4378
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:14,460
And then one right here.

4379
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:15,220
Oh, okay.

4380
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:15,980
Now I have 7.

4381
02:38:16,280 --> 02:38:17,760
Wait, how did you have 8 then?

4382
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:18,960
Where's the eighth one?

4383
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:22,560
Wait, where?

4384
02:38:22,660 --> 02:38:22,960
What tree?

4385
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,200
Contestants will compete in our battle.

4386
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:30,840
Where was the last one you got?

4387
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:31,440
Oh, over here.

4388
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,980
People said there's some outside.

4389
02:38:35,620 --> 02:38:37,900
Yeah, we got the tree outside already.

4390
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:38,760
Oh, wait.

4391
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:39,520
Is this the same outside?

4392
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:39,900
Oh.

4393
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:42,780
Yeah, there should be more around here.

4394
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:44,900
Oh, are we gonna watch them?

4395
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:46,100
I don't know.

4396
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:47,880
Oh, we're right here.

4397
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:51,060
Yeah, I got it.

4398
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:52,560
Alright, let's see if we watch them.

4399
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:54,400
Oh, wait.

4400
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:55,500
I guess we watch.

4401
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:57,520
Oh my god.

4402
02:38:57,620 --> 02:38:58,060
I got so scared.

4403
02:38:58,460 --> 02:38:59,720
I thought I was in tie breaker.

4404
02:39:00,460 --> 02:39:01,580
That was so cool.

4405
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:03,400
Guys, write this down.

4406
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:05,140
We're gonna steal... I mean, borrow this.

4407
02:39:05,380 --> 02:39:05,980
For our own stuff.

4408
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:07,080
For our own...

4409
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:10,220
Hey, Goomy, where are you?

4410
02:39:12,020 --> 02:39:13,000
Stelky, where are you going?

4411
02:39:13,140 --> 02:39:13,760
Oh, I'm here.

4412
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:15,320
Guys, write this down.

4413
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:16,320
We're gonna...

4414
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:20,820
You see, people are running with particles.

4415
02:39:20,980 --> 02:39:22,460
If they have a particle, you don't want to be near them.

4416
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:23,640
You just need to run away, you know?

4417
02:39:23,820 --> 02:39:24,420
Oh my god.

4418
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:29,940
Oh, I'm actually gonna pee my pants.

4419
02:39:31,460 --> 02:39:33,560
I'm actually gonna pee my pants.

4420
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:34,480
I'm wet.

4421
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:37,240
The sound effects are so scary.

4422
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:37,640
The sound effects are so scary.

4423
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:38,440
Oh!

4424
02:39:40,340 --> 02:39:41,800
It's like Crab Game.

4425
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:45,660
It's like Crab Game.

4426
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:46,460
Go, K, Go!

4427
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:47,800
Go, K, Go!

4428
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:49,560
Go, K, Go!

4429
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:51,180
It's just like Crab Game.

4430
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,140
You know, with the stick?

4431
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:53,420
Yeah, the hot potato.

4432
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:54,980
Go, K, Go!

4433
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:56,180
Nice.

4434
02:39:58,080 --> 02:39:59,920
That is not enough time.

4435
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:01,420
Go, K, Go!

4436
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:04,040
That is absolutely not enough time.

4437
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:05,980
Oh, there's no way!

4438
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:06,680
Oh, there's no way!

4439
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,400
Good shoot!

4440
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:09,360
Oh!

4441
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:11,260
They left!

4442
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:15,740
That is not enough time.

4443
02:40:15,900 --> 02:40:17,880
Yeah, it's like 20 seconds.

4444
02:40:18,140 --> 02:40:29,060
It's so crazy that you got through with 16 points and Open Water lost and I think he had 17 because Green was so competitive.

4445
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:29,400
You gotta dodge.

4446
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:31,300
You just shift to the blue.

4447
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:31,920
Oh, no.

4448
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:33,240
Come on, Silverman.

4449
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:34,600
I'm just so scared for him.

4450
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:37,480
So, do you have to try and hit the other player while you have the...

4451
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:37,780
You can't even see.

4452
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:38,780
Yeah!

4453
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:41,860
The curse is consumed.

4454
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:44,300
Oh, like invis, invis, invis.

4455
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:48,800
Oh, I guess like one elimination criteria met.

4456
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:49,440
Wait, who lived?

4457
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:54,540
I feel like anyone that got like the curse lost automatically.

4458
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:56,540
Because that was so brutal.

4459
02:40:57,380 --> 02:41:02,860
Yeah, I feel like if you have the curse, you just automatically lose.

4460
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:03,860
No.

4461
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:05,560
There's no way.

4462
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:06,180
Yeah.

4463
02:41:06,820 --> 02:41:07,320
Yeah, yeah.

4464
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:12,020
Yeah, map's too big and the time's too short there.

4465
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:13,060
I hope they adjust that.

4466
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:14,280
It seems pretty unfair.

4467
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:17,120
Guys, I did not expect to make it to Day 2.

4468
02:41:17,220 --> 02:41:19,300
I thought I was gonna have like a one-week vacation.

4469
02:41:19,940 --> 02:41:21,500
Well, I mean like...

4470
02:41:23,380 --> 02:41:25,680
Most likely I'll be eliminated on Day 2.

4471
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:26,820
I don't think I'm gonna...

4472
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:31,180
No, you're fine.

4473
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:31,440
No, you're fine.

4474
02:41:31,580 --> 02:41:31,840
You're fine.

4475
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:32,520
You got 30 seconds.

4476
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:34,420
You need to track them the fuck down.

4477
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:35,340
Like...

4478
02:41:37,860 --> 02:41:38,300
Maybe...

4479
02:41:38,300 --> 02:41:40,420
I feel like I'm gonna get eliminated.

4480
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:43,200
There's no way I'll live past the second day.

4481
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:45,280
These guys are Minecraft players.

4482
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:48,420
Find the tenth egg.

4483
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:49,280
Ooh, you're right.

4484
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:51,240
Wait, another one?

4485
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:53,680
There's another tiebreaker?

4486
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:57,220
I don't know if you guys knew, but I could hear you and I heard all of you guys.

4487
02:41:57,220 --> 02:41:57,700
Oh my god.

4488
02:41:58,620 --> 02:41:59,520
There's another... Okay, guys.

4489
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:02,300
Do you guys know where the Easter eggs are?

4490
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,300
We're gonna try.

4491
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:07,840
Oh my god.

4492
02:42:07,900 --> 02:42:09,100
So many tiebreakers.

4493
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:10,300
I know.

4494
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:11,280
I already discovered this.

4495
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:13,540
Multiple teams needed...

4496
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:17,160
Multiple teams needed to...

4497
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:18,880
Oh, I thought that was like everybody.

4498
02:42:19,500 --> 02:42:23,840
Oh, I guess cause like each color had tiebreakers.

4499
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,360
Guys!

4500
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:25,440
Stream snipe time!

4501
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:28,940
Where's the last... Where's the last TV?

4502
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:32,580
Yeah, for each color.

4503
02:42:32,680 --> 02:42:37,100
Oh, cause ours was the... was the one that didn't have the thing.

4504
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:38,480
Bottom...

4505
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:38,780
Guys!

4506
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,920
Bottom right is not an answer.

4507
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:48,100
Bottom right is not an answer, guys.

4508
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:51,500
Bottom left, Toki.

4509
02:42:51,740 --> 02:42:53,140
Shit, you're fucking right.

4510
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:55,020
Let me go check bottom left.

4511
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:57,220
It's over there.

4512
02:42:57,340 --> 02:42:57,860
It's there!

4513
02:42:58,140 --> 02:42:58,660
Here!

4514
02:42:59,100 --> 02:42:59,820
Up there!

4515
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:02,420
Disempate numero 2.

4516
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:04,740
I don't understand why we had to have emote only.

4517
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:08,880
If we didn't have emote only, you guys would have fucking broke my...

4518
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:12,360
You guys would have fucking snitched me out.

4519
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:13,920
On the guilt trip.

4520
02:43:19,480 --> 02:43:22,500
You guys would have 100% snitched me out.

4521
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:23,620
Oh my god.

4522
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:24,100
Oh my god.

4523
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:24,320
Oh my god.

4524
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:26,700
No, we already got that TV.

4525
02:43:27,180 --> 02:43:28,200
We already got that.

4526
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:29,420
He's right here.

4527
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:29,740
He's right here.

4528
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:32,040
You've got the silver!

4529
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:35,160
I've no idea who these people are, but I guess I'll cheer for...

4530
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:35,740
Good luck, y'all.

4531
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,420
I'll cheer for the first person I see.

4532
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:39,000
Run!

4533
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:40,580
It's in your name.

4534
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:41,520
That's what I'm saying.

4535
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:46,220
Like, bro, there's no way he's gonna chase... He has 20 seconds to get to him.

4536
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:47,080
There's no way.

4537
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:48,840
Oh my god.

4538
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:50,640
He's so far away, my render is gone.

4539
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:54,260
He's so far away.

4540
02:43:54,260 --> 02:43:55,000
He's so far away.

4541
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:58,240
My render distance doesn't make it.

4542
02:44:04,300 --> 02:44:05,400
Oh my god.

4543
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:08,820
Chosen...

4544
02:44:08,820 --> 02:44:09,640
Vios.

4545
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:11,780
Yeah, look at...

4546
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:12,380
Everybody knows.

4547
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:13,280
Where is Silva?

4548
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:14,720
Oh!

4549
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:16,040
Wait, he actually caught somebody!

4550
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:17,360
She did it!

4551
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:20,400
Oh my god, the first person to catch somebody!

4552
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:22,380
I'm scared.

4553
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:26,580
Oh my god, the very first one.

4554
02:44:27,820 --> 02:44:28,580
There they are.

4555
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:31,700
I don't think there's enough time for someone to get somebody out.

4556
02:44:31,740 --> 02:44:32,600
I don't think Silva has it.

4557
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:33,160
Yeah, everybody.

4558
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:35,520
It's to be... This game mode is...

4559
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:37,520
Wait, they didn't test this, surely.

4560
02:44:38,140 --> 02:44:38,560
Surely they not?

4561
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:41,880
Streamers not testing stuff?

4562
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:42,940
No way!

4563
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:44,640
Let's go!

4564
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:46,820
That's it?

4565
02:44:46,940 --> 02:44:47,620
That was so fast.

4566
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:48,540
Did we get anything for that?

4567
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:50,420
That was so fucking fast.

4568
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:51,960
Real.

4569
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:54,440
Thanks so much.

4570
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:54,640
You're the best.

4571
02:44:55,980 --> 02:44:58,260
Streamers actually testing video games?

4572
02:44:58,440 --> 02:44:59,720
No fucking way.

4573
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:01,120
Kratos!

4574
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:06,280
Oh my god.

4575
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:09,840
Nah, there's no way.

4576
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:12,020
Maybe there should be...

4577
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:13,360
Maybe there's a TV in the bedroom.

4578
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:15,260
Do you think there's TVs in the bedroom?

4579
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:17,260
We literally are missing like one TV.

4580
02:45:17,700 --> 02:45:19,460
We got all the other TVs.

4581
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:22,020
We're just missing one TV left.

4582
02:45:23,180 --> 02:45:24,200
Check the graveyard?

4583
02:45:24,380 --> 02:45:25,100
There's a graveyard?

4584
02:45:27,620 --> 02:45:29,340
Wait, there's a fucking graveyard?

4585
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:32,260
Wait, there's a fucking graveyard?

4586
02:45:32,260 --> 02:45:34,220
Yeah, I wish we had like the invisible flying.

4587
02:45:34,680 --> 02:45:34,800
Yeah, I wish we had like the invisible flying.

4588
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:35,940
I think the invisible flying.

4589
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:38,720
Graveyard?

4590
02:45:38,820 --> 02:45:40,020
Oh, the purple portal!

4591
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:40,160
Graveyard?

4592
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:40,160
Oh, the purple portal!

4593
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:41,220
You can go through that?

4594
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:42,620
Okay, let's check it out.

4595
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:44,740
Let's check it out.

4596
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:46,900
Nice.

4597
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:48,820
Alright.

4598
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:51,020
Let's head to the portal.

4599
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,840
We have two more.

4600
02:45:54,120 --> 02:45:54,600
We have two more.

4601
02:45:56,140 --> 02:45:58,500
Wait, I might be like the last VTuber.

4602
02:46:02,540 --> 02:46:03,260
What's this?

4603
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:06,120
These are everybody that died!

4604
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:07,880
Right?

4605
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:10,520
No, who the fuck are these people?

4606
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:11,820
There's no way.

4607
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:12,600
Wait, that's me!

4608
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:15,020
I'm dead!

4609
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:22,160
Oh my god!

4610
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,620
I'm secretly a ghost!

4611
02:46:25,980 --> 02:46:28,100
Alright guys, I don't think they're in the graveyard.

4612
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:29,820
I don't think the TV is in the graveyard.

4613
02:46:29,980 --> 02:46:30,420
Guys.

4614
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:35,280
Yeah, this is everybody's...

4615
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:39,200
Oh, the ones that didn't make it are like a tombstone.

4616
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:40,020
Oh, I see!

4617
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:43,120
The ones that didn't make it are...

4618
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,460
Wait, they didn't teleport us!

4619
02:46:45,160 --> 02:46:46,720
Is it because we're in the graveyard?

4620
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:48,920
Wait, I didn't get teleported!

4621
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:50,320
No!

4622
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:52,140
Oh, wait, no.

4623
02:46:52,220 --> 02:46:52,960
They didn't start yet.

4624
02:46:55,780 --> 02:46:57,120
They didn't start yet.

4625
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:00,800
I'll never find the last...

4626
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:01,560
What the fuck?

4627
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:03,000
It was so fast!

4628
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:10,280
Who are the two people that are alive?

4629
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:12,400
They told us not to disconnect, so...

4630
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:14,000
So I'm like...

4631
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,820
I'm like being a good person.

4632
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:18,480
Actually, Hax!

4633
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:19,100
No!

4634
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:22,680
They said don't leave!

4635
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:24,160
So I'm actually listening!

4636
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:27,480
There's no way!

4637
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:29,800
He's not gonna find him.

4638
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:32,280
Bro, he's not gonna fucking find him.

4639
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:41,100
Bro, he can't even find him!

4640
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:43,260
That's so fucked!

4641
02:47:44,740 --> 02:47:46,160
It's so fucked!

4642
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:48,240
He doesn't even know where he is!

4643
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:50,300
Another VTuber.

4644
02:47:50,320 --> 02:47:50,960
Another VTuber gone.

4645
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:54,520
Oh, wait, unless...

4646
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:55,720
Oh, unless...

4647
02:47:55,720 --> 02:47:56,780
Oh, no, no, that's the...

4648
02:47:56,780 --> 02:47:58,860
This is so rigged.

4649
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:00,960
I know...

4650
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:03,320
I wish we could like fly.

4651
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,320
Good job, good job, good job.

4652
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:07,280
I can't believe you survived!

4653
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:08,660
I did!

4654
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:10,280
Good escort!

4655
02:48:12,070 --> 02:48:13,860
I think I'm like intruding.

4656
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,500
I'm definitely intruding.

4657
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:20,120
I'm definitely intruding.

4658
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:21,120
I'm gonna go get some food.

4659
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:23,760
I'm gonna go get some food.

4660
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:25,480
Oh, nice!

4661
02:48:26,220 --> 02:48:27,480
He lived!

4662
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:28,060
Woo!

4663
02:48:29,960 --> 02:48:32,640
I'll never find the last Easter egg.

4664
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:34,740
I'll never find it.

4665
02:48:34,740 --> 02:48:35,140
I'll never find it.

4666
02:48:36,340 --> 02:48:37,880
I'm glad it didn't.

4667
02:48:38,340 --> 02:48:40,640
Where the heck is the last TV?

4668
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:41,220
Where the heck is the last TV?

4669
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:44,380
How was I supposed to know?

4670
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:44,500
Oops.

4671
02:48:44,940 --> 02:48:48,380
I think this last egg guy actually scrambled it and it doesn't exist.

4672
02:48:50,140 --> 02:48:52,380
In the end...

4673
02:48:52,380 --> 02:48:57,760
I hope everybody that lied to me and started my joker arc does not win...

4674
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,880
does not win Top 20.

4675
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:01,280
Holy shit!

4676
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:03,520
He's so fast!

4677
02:49:03,780 --> 02:49:05,380
I hope they don't win.

4678
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:12,600
I hope they wasted their time and they get eliminated on Day 4...

4679
02:49:16,440 --> 02:49:22,160
I hope they get eliminated I'm living in day 4 because that's a cutoff when the money stops.

4680
02:49:23,140 --> 02:49:25,960
When the money just starts going in.

4681
02:49:27,260 --> 02:49:29,620
That's all I care about.

4682
02:49:30,860 --> 02:49:32,480
That's so evil.

4683
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:36,440
All those people that started my joker.

4684
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:40,900
There's like two outside here.

4685
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:43,560
So there should be two outside the other area.

4686
02:49:46,380 --> 02:49:48,560
It's not a waste of exposure.

4687
02:49:49,700 --> 02:49:52,740
Yeah, but it's not $70,000.

4688
02:49:58,980 --> 02:50:00,240
You know what?

4689
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:02,920
I hope one of them was just barely set.

4690
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:04,840
Like they get second place.

4691
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:10,460
So they feel like shit that they didn't win first.

4692
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:14,680
I already discovered that.

4693
02:50:15,320 --> 02:50:16,860
God, that sucks.

4694
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:20,440
When they barely missed out on the $70,000.

4695
02:50:21,320 --> 02:50:23,760
That's what they get for lying to me.

4696
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,920
No, it's like top 20.

4697
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:30,600
So I think like first is $70,000.

4698
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:33,460
Second is... what is second again guys?

4699
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:35,180
Do you guys know what second is?

4700
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:36,720
Because I don't remember.

4701
02:50:37,220 --> 02:50:40,480
I just know first is $70,000 because it's fucking $70,000.

4702
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:42,980
And then $12,000?

4703
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:43,540
Okay, second is $70,000.

4704
02:50:43,560 --> 02:50:45,940
Second is like $12,000.

4705
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:51,720
And then third to 20th is $1,000.

4706
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:53,340
Wait, Gumi found the last Easter egg?

4707
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:57,940
Wait, where's Gumi?

4708
02:50:58,900 --> 02:50:59,400
Where's Gumi?

4709
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:01,100
Where is she?

4710
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:04,760
Are you sure you're in?

4711
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:06,200
Yes, I'm 100% sure.

4712
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:10,700
Because the person that I guilt tripped was lower points than me, but they made it.

4713
02:51:11,440 --> 02:51:12,400
That's why I know.

4714
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:14,500
Top right guys.

4715
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:16,560
Which outside?

4716
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:17,560
This outside?

4717
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:18,820
The other outside?

4718
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:22,760
It has to be this other.

4719
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:23,940
Oh my God, I love this guy's skin.

4720
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:26,620
No, I was so close outside.

4721
02:51:28,660 --> 02:51:30,140
I was so close.

4722
02:51:30,340 --> 02:51:31,280
Oh wait, that's not the outside.

4723
02:51:31,720 --> 02:51:32,180
No.

4724
02:51:33,280 --> 02:51:36,720
Oh, I just saw Gumi too.

4725
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:39,760
Oh, it's that outside.

4726
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:41,600
Okay, now we know where the TV is.

4727
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:42,640
I'm glad we got through this day.

4728
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:42,920
Okay.

4729
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:44,500
I literally don't know how to go over this group, so like...

4730
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:46,040
Nice.

4731
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:48,140
I'm gonna take the high ground.

4732
02:51:48,520 --> 02:51:50,520
Wait, Twitch says no outside.

4733
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:53,600
Ask for coordinates.

4734
02:51:54,380 --> 02:51:55,800
Show your coordinates, Doki.

4735
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:57,360
Find the coordinates.

4736
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:58,380
Apparently somebody...

4737
02:51:58,380 --> 02:51:59,080
Yeah, yeah.

4738
02:51:59,340 --> 02:51:59,780
Hey.

4739
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:04,340
Silver, if you have like, if you have a potato, do you have it at all?

4740
02:52:04,940 --> 02:52:05,620
No, I didn't.

4741
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:08,160
Can you say shout out to...

4742
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:08,880
I just got lucky.

4743
02:52:08,960 --> 02:52:09,740
I don't even think you...

4744
02:52:09,740 --> 02:52:10,720
Shout out to who?

4745
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:11,780
It's so...

4746
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:13,220
Fuzzy Snugs.

4747
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:13,780
Can you say that?

4748
02:52:13,900 --> 02:52:14,580
Fuzzy Snugs?

4749
02:52:14,880 --> 02:52:17,460
Yeah, Fuzzy, like, you know, like Fuzzy, like, you know...

4750
02:52:17,460 --> 02:52:18,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4751
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:19,480
Okay, what's in it for me?

4752
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:22,500
What's in it for me?

4753
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:24,400
You get to make somebody happy, I guess.

4754
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:27,380
Is this a cameo?

4755
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:29,320
Yes, yes.

4756
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:31,540
Cameo?

4757
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:35,740
Okay, follow me on Twitter and I'll shout him out.

4758
02:52:38,940 --> 02:52:40,460
What's in it for me?

4759
02:52:40,460 --> 02:52:40,700
For me?

4760
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:41,600
You know, like...

4761
02:52:42,580 --> 02:52:44,680
Wait, I'm doing a favor for you!

4762
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:46,900
I'm doing a favor for you!

4763
02:52:47,100 --> 02:52:48,700
Listen, there is no incentive for me.

4764
02:52:48,780 --> 02:52:53,600
I just said, so very simply, somebody in my stream chat is a big fan.

4765
02:52:54,880 --> 02:52:56,940
Yeah, and I'm doing you a favor.

4766
02:52:57,460 --> 02:52:58,320
Not me a favor.

4767
02:52:58,520 --> 02:53:00,540
I don't care what happens, okay?

4768
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:01,280
No more!

4769
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:04,080
Yeah, like, so you hate your chat.

4770
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:05,800
You're not allowed to follow me on Twitter.

4771
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:05,800
It's one click.

4772
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:06,340
Yes, actually, I do.

4773
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:07,560
I definitely do hate...

4774
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:07,640
It's one click.

4775
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:09,800
I definitely do hate my chat.

4776
02:53:09,800 --> 02:53:11,500
But you can't say two words.

4777
02:53:11,640 --> 02:53:12,000
It's one click.

4778
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,660
You can't say, ah, shout out Swizzy Stuggs, shout out Jesse.

4779
02:53:14,960 --> 02:53:16,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you see?

4780
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:17,860
Now who's the big person now?

4781
02:53:17,880 --> 02:53:18,740
Hey, that's in your chat.

4782
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:19,680
That's not my chat.

4783
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:21,160
Yeah, okay, listen.

4784
02:53:21,400 --> 02:53:22,480
That's not my chat.

4785
02:53:22,480 --> 02:53:22,740
Listen, okay?

4786
02:53:23,240 --> 02:53:26,180
Listen, I don't know who you are, but apparently they do, okay?

4787
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:27,760
So, you know, what's in it for me?

4788
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:29,300
It's one click.

4789
02:53:29,380 --> 02:53:32,040
Oh, you're not willing to do one click just to...

4790
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:33,280
I don't do much things.

4791
02:53:35,180 --> 02:53:35,840
I'll never learn.

4792
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:36,560
I'll never learn.

4793
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:36,980
I'm not...

4794
02:53:38,120 --> 02:53:39,620
Damn, that's fucked up.

4795
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:41,980
He's not willing to...

4796
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:50,300
He just showed up.

4797
02:53:50,300 --> 02:53:51,220
Thank God.

4798
02:53:51,540 --> 02:53:58,780
He showed up to snoke.

4799
02:53:58,820 --> 02:54:00,460
It's a snokey post.

4800
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:02,520
So rude.

4801
02:54:03,360 --> 02:54:05,360
Why am I the rude one?

4802
02:54:05,560 --> 02:54:05,920
They...

4803
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:08,260
They asked me for a shout out.

4804
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:11,300
I was like, alright, one click, follow me on Twitter.

4805
02:54:12,260 --> 02:54:16,260
Just one click, two words.

4806
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:17,980
It's a good exchange.

4807
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:19,680
I give you a...

4808
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:22,100
Two words, one click.

4809
02:54:23,180 --> 02:54:24,560
Clicking is free.

4810
02:54:24,920 --> 02:54:26,840
Yeah, clicking is free.

4811
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:28,640
It's a good exchange.

4812
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:33,540
Yeah, click, follow me on Twitter.

4813
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:35,360
Yeah, equivalent exchange.

4814
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:35,380
It's a good exchange.

4815
02:54:36,360 --> 02:54:37,620
It's just business.

4816
02:54:39,300 --> 02:54:42,440
Yeah, you didn't even have to stay follow.

4817
02:54:46,240 --> 02:54:49,180
Hey guys, if you're from SonicFox's...

4818
02:54:50,040 --> 02:54:52,620
SonicFox's chat, I would never do that to you.

4819
02:54:52,780 --> 02:54:54,500
I love my chat.

4820
02:54:57,440 --> 02:54:58,480
Right, tragoons?

4821
02:54:58,740 --> 02:55:01,440
I will never do that to you guys.

4822
02:55:01,540 --> 02:55:02,380
Look where I'm standing.

4823
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:02,720
Look where I'm standing.

4824
02:55:04,180 --> 02:55:05,200
Where is the TV?

4825
02:55:05,500 --> 02:55:07,320
Where is the TV?

4826
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:07,320
Here!

4827
02:55:07,480 --> 02:55:08,320
Walk right here!

4828
02:55:08,420 --> 02:55:10,000
Is there a TV here?

4829
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:10,680
Right here.

4830
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:13,960
Is there a TV here?

4831
02:55:13,960 --> 02:55:13,980
Put it down!

4832
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:14,180
Put it down!

4833
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:19,340
MAMMAR!

4834
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:21,360
Yeah?

4835
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:22,600
Where is it?

4836
02:55:23,880 --> 02:55:25,160
I can't see!

4837
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:28,660
Where is the TV?

4838
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:30,680
Where is the TV?

4839
02:55:34,620 --> 02:55:35,620
Where is the TV?

4840
02:55:35,860 --> 02:55:36,540
Where is the TV?

4841
02:55:36,920 --> 02:55:38,400
Where is the TV?

4842
02:55:38,740 --> 02:55:38,940
Where is the TV?

4843
02:55:38,940 --> 02:55:39,920
Guys, I need...

4844
02:55:40,720 --> 02:55:43,340
Guys, I need you guys to translate!

4845
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:43,960
Guys, I need you guys to translate!

4846
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:44,460
Guys, I need you guys to translate!

4847
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:44,820
Yeah!

4848
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:49,500
Where is it?

4849
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:52,560
Oh my God!

4850
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:53,400
Finally!

4851
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:54,800
That's crazy!

4852
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:56,280
Wait, I see it!

4853
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:56,640
Yeah!

4854
02:55:56,820 --> 02:55:58,500
Oh my God!

4855
02:55:58,700 --> 02:56:00,220
I followed the Minecraft!

4856
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:03,020
Translated!

4857
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:03,640
We did it!

4858
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:04,320
We got everything!

4859
02:56:04,920 --> 02:56:06,560
We got everything, guys!

4860
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:08,340
We got everything!

4861
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:09,420
Perfect game!

4862
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:11,060
We did it!

4863
02:56:12,220 --> 02:56:12,600
Yeah!

4864
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:16,160
Oh my God!

4865
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:17,500
That one was hard!

4866
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:20,660
That one was fucking hard!

4867
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:21,380
Alright, let me see.

4868
02:56:21,500 --> 02:56:22,120
I'm gonna check.

4869
02:56:22,320 --> 02:56:23,840
I'm gonna check if he followed.

4870
02:56:27,480 --> 02:56:29,300
This is important, guys!

4871
02:56:29,580 --> 02:56:30,460
We gotta know!

4872
02:56:32,400 --> 02:56:34,180
I'm gonna see the ones outside of this.

4873
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:36,840
There's one in the tree and then there's one in the other.

4874
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:38,560
They didn't follow!

4875
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:39,520
No!

4876
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:42,220
No shoutout!

4877
02:56:42,260 --> 02:56:43,440
No shoutout!

4878
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:51,960
That was broadcast on the main Rylos channel.

4879
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:54,920
Oh, the... us all fucking bunching up.

4880
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:57,900
That entire conversation!

4881
02:56:58,380 --> 02:56:59,100
Wait, really?

4882
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:01,680
Wait!

4883
02:57:02,360 --> 02:57:04,760
That entire conversation I had?

4884
02:57:05,880 --> 02:57:08,240
No fucking way!

4885
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:10,040
No fucking way!

4886
02:57:10,040 --> 02:57:10,940
Oh my God!

4887
02:57:11,660 --> 02:57:13,720
I can't believe it!

4888
02:57:13,740 --> 02:57:14,540
I can't believe it!

4889
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:15,300
There's no way!

4890
02:57:17,280 --> 02:57:18,880
Oh no!

4891
02:57:19,360 --> 02:57:20,460
I got exposed!

4892
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:22,920
I want the hair.

4893
02:57:23,560 --> 02:57:23,760
I want the hair.

4894
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:24,880
Damn.

4895
02:57:25,240 --> 02:57:26,200
I got exposed.

4896
02:57:28,220 --> 02:57:29,020
Exposed.

4897
02:57:29,020 --> 02:57:30,180
I'm showing the world.

4898
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:32,060
What do you mean?

4899
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:32,900
They...

4900
02:57:32,900 --> 02:57:36,800
They literally said, I hate my chat.

4901
02:57:37,140 --> 02:57:39,500
So I... it caught them in 4K.

4902
02:57:39,740 --> 02:57:40,620
It caught...

4903
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:42,800
They got caught on 4K.

4904
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,340
And I was like, whoa, I would never...

4905
02:57:45,340 --> 02:57:48,000
I was like, whoa, I would never...

4906
02:57:49,400 --> 02:57:50,720
Oh, hey!

4907
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:51,940
Hey, guys!

4908
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:53,320
Ready to play Valorant?

4909
02:57:53,640 --> 02:57:55,500
Oh, yeah.

4910
02:57:55,500 --> 02:57:57,600
I almost forgot about that.

4911
02:57:58,300 --> 02:58:00,080
Yeah, you can never forget about it.

4912
02:58:00,360 --> 02:58:01,160
Wait, wait, wait.

4913
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:01,560
Right now.

4914
02:58:01,660 --> 02:58:03,540
I need to get... get lunch first.

4915
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:04,280
And then I can play.

4916
02:58:04,400 --> 02:58:04,900
But I'll be playing.

4917
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,000
I won't be streaming it though.

4918
02:58:06,200 --> 02:58:06,420
Okay.

4919
02:58:07,600 --> 02:58:09,320
You get lunch first and then we can play.

4920
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:10,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4921
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:12,120
Is it over yet?

4922
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:13,240
Like, what are we waiting for?

4923
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:14,280
Yeah, it's over.

4924
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:15,240
Oh, okay.

4925
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:17,460
Cause like they never said you're allowed to leave now.

4926
02:58:17,700 --> 02:58:17,720
Oh, like, don't be!

4927
02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:19,420
I got all 10 eggs!

4928
02:58:19,780 --> 02:58:20,420
Oh, me too!

4929
02:58:20,500 --> 02:58:21,060
I found it!

4930
02:58:21,060 --> 02:58:21,240
Yeah!

4931
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:22,260
What the heck?

4932
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:23,160
You found all 10?

4933
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:24,120
You found it in the dark?

4934
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:26,200
Yeah, the last one's at the dark.

4935
02:58:26,260 --> 02:58:27,320
Wait, how many do you have, Ant?

4936
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:28,740
I have 8 right now.

4937
02:58:30,320 --> 02:58:33,000
What the fuck?

4938
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:34,180
You just started laughing!

4939
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:36,720
I have a crazy laugh right now.

4940
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:39,180
Wait, what about us?

4941
02:58:39,380 --> 02:58:40,120
I have 10!

4942
02:58:40,300 --> 02:58:41,080
What happens now?

4943
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,720
I don't think... it's just nothing.

4944
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:44,720
It's just like bragging power.

4945
02:58:45,820 --> 02:58:48,800
By having 10, you get to laugh at people who don't have 10.

4946
02:58:48,900 --> 02:58:49,360
Like that.

4947
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:51,720
I know one that I didn't get yet.

4948
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:52,980
Maybe we'll get that one.

4949
02:58:54,060 --> 02:58:56,580
There's one outside that's really fucked up.

4950
02:58:57,220 --> 02:58:57,900
Yeah, come on.

4951
02:58:57,900 --> 02:58:58,480
Is it like in a tree?

4952
02:58:58,660 --> 02:58:59,520
Cause I didn't get that one yet.

4953
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:00,640
No, it's really fucked up.

4954
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:01,920
It's really fucked up.

4955
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:03,560
Alright, I'm gonna go grab lunch.

4956
02:59:03,560 --> 02:59:04,540
I'll see you later, Gumi.

4957
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:06,040
DM me, DM me!

4958
02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:06,500
Alright, alright.

4959
02:59:06,780 --> 02:59:07,440
Alright, guys.

4960
02:59:07,620 --> 02:59:08,480
We made it, guys!

4961
02:59:09,220 --> 02:59:11,280
We made it today, too!

4962
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:15,880
I can't believe my whole conversation was put up on stream.

4963
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:18,320
I can't believe my whole conversation was put up on stream.

4964
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:19,920
We made it!

4965
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:21,360
We made it!

4966
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:25,580
Good time interacting with people I haven't interacted with before.

4967
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:26,120
Yeah.

4968
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:27,480
And...

4969
02:59:29,080 --> 02:59:29,980
How dare!

4970
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:34,480
And I had a good time just talking to people, and like...

4971
02:59:34,480 --> 02:59:35,500
Okay, the first...

4972
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:38,800
The first one...

4973
02:59:39,120 --> 02:59:41,800
The first one was really fucked up, though.

4974
02:59:41,960 --> 02:59:45,400
I think the first game was super fucked up.

4975
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:48,560
That one was messed up for me.

4976
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:51,260
That one was messed up for me.

4977
02:59:51,260 --> 02:59:53,360
I can barely play the game and it took so long.

4978
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:55,280
It took so long!

4979
02:59:56,320 --> 03:00:01,800
I can barely take in anything that was going on in the first one.

4980
03:00:02,040 --> 03:00:05,380
And I felt like that should have been much shorter, 100%.

4981
03:00:05,380 --> 03:00:07,040
But the second one was fun.

4982
03:00:07,140 --> 03:00:08,280
The second game was really fun.

4983
03:00:08,400 --> 03:00:09,720
I think the best part was just interacting.

4984
03:00:09,920 --> 03:00:13,420
Nobody expected me to make it to the second game.

4985
03:00:13,840 --> 03:00:15,000
But we did it.

4986
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:17,440
Yeah, I was running a goddamn marathon.

4987
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:23,160
I was running a goddamn marathon in the first game.

4988
03:00:23,380 --> 03:00:25,720
And I was like, please, let this be over.

4989
03:00:26,020 --> 03:00:27,180
And I was doing it wrong.

4990
03:00:27,860 --> 03:00:30,560
I was doing the marathon wrong too.

4991
03:00:30,740 --> 03:00:32,260
Because I wasn't holding space.

4992
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:34,720
Because I didn't know the Minecraft tech.

4993
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:36,500
The second game was fun.

4994
03:00:36,700 --> 03:00:37,980
I had a great time in the second game.

4995
03:00:38,780 --> 03:00:41,400
I still can't believe Mendo and Sleepy didn't make it through.

4996
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:42,320
What the fuck?

4997
03:00:42,340 --> 03:00:43,440
They were so confident earlier.

4998
03:00:47,940 --> 03:00:49,360
JokeyBird was born today.

4999
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:52,360
But yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5000
03:00:52,480 --> 03:00:53,760
I think it's the same time.

5001
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:59,320
It's the same time tomorrow.

5002
03:01:00,360 --> 03:01:02,000
And there's also two games.

5003
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:03,880
So we'll see if we get eliminated.

5004
03:01:04,860 --> 03:01:05,840
But anyway, guys.

5005
03:01:06,160 --> 03:01:07,080
I'm going to call it here.

5006
03:01:07,160 --> 03:01:07,740
I'm all ready to go.

5007
03:01:08,400 --> 03:01:10,520
Since I'll be showing up after lunch.

5008
03:01:10,640 --> 03:01:11,680
After I get food.

5009
03:01:11,940 --> 03:01:12,720
But anyway, guys.

5010
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:14,320
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

5011
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:15,300
Posture check.

5012
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:16,660
Get a bit more around.

5013
03:01:16,720 --> 03:01:17,320
Get that blood.

5014
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:18,940
And if you stay up for me.

5015
03:01:19,080 --> 03:01:19,820
Head to bed.

5016
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:20,900
Or I don't know.

5017
03:01:20,960 --> 03:01:21,680
Stay up for Valorant.

5018
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:23,660
Because you deserve it.

5019
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:24,880
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5020
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:25,940
Oh shit.

5021
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:26,340
Never mind.

5022
03:01:26,420 --> 03:01:27,120
Let's take a group picture.

5023
03:01:27,420 --> 03:01:27,820
JK.

5024
03:01:29,860 --> 03:01:30,260
JK.

5025
03:01:30,380 --> 03:01:31,680
I want to be part of the group picture.

5026
03:01:31,920 --> 03:01:32,320
Exposure.

5027
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:35,420
Wait.

5028
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:36,000
Mainstairs?

5029
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:36,600
Okay.

5030
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:38,580
Guys, we got to get the exposure.

5031
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:39,740
We made it to day one.

5032
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:41,900
They're going to post a screenshot.

5033
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:44,160
Bro.

5034
03:01:44,160 --> 03:01:46,880
The Minecraft streamers are going to post the screenshot guys.

5035
03:01:48,420 --> 03:01:49,620
Pre-exposure.

5036
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:50,040
Yeah.

5037
03:01:51,400 --> 03:01:54,620
I'm going to sorority crouch.

5038
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:55,760
Yes.

5039
03:01:55,880 --> 03:01:56,780
Sorority crouch.

5040
03:01:57,400 --> 03:01:58,240
Sorority crouch.

5041
03:01:58,600 --> 03:01:59,200
Okay.

5042
03:01:59,360 --> 03:02:01,360
The worst part is that I actually don't have a costume.

5043
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:02,700
Wait.

5044
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:03,360
What's up?

5045
03:02:03,920 --> 03:02:04,580
What's the...

5046
03:02:05,400 --> 03:02:07,540
To show you guys what I'm wearing.

5047
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:08,680
Guys.

5048
03:02:09,720 --> 03:02:10,800
What the fuck?

5049
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:12,340
F5?

5050
03:02:12,660 --> 03:02:13,260
Is that F5?

5051
03:02:14,200 --> 03:02:14,800
Alright.

5052
03:02:14,860 --> 03:02:15,660
This is my skin.

5053
03:02:15,860 --> 03:02:16,460
Uhhh.

5054
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:22,680
Yeah.

5055
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:22,780
Thank you.

5056
03:02:22,940 --> 03:02:23,300
Thank you.

5057
03:02:23,420 --> 03:02:24,380
This is nice to see you guys.

5058
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:27,060
I want to be TP.

5059
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:28,300
Picture.

5060
03:02:28,540 --> 03:02:28,900
Picture.

5061
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:29,320
Picture.

5062
03:02:31,220 --> 03:02:32,280
Take a picture.

5063
03:02:32,460 --> 03:02:32,880
For me.

5064
03:02:32,960 --> 03:02:34,080
I'll be brown bear now.

5065
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:36,000
Picture.

5066
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:36,480
Picture.

5067
03:02:36,840 --> 03:02:37,320
Photo.

5068
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:38,560
Photo.

5069
03:02:38,560 --> 03:02:38,760
Photo.

5070
03:02:41,280 --> 03:02:42,240
Say Queso.

5071
03:02:42,320 --> 03:02:42,860
Say Queso.

5072
03:02:42,860 --> 03:02:43,220
Queso.

5073
03:02:44,140 --> 03:02:44,620
Queso.

5074
03:02:47,360 --> 03:02:49,300
Oh my god!

5075
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:50,960
Oh my god!

5076
03:02:54,340 --> 03:02:54,940
Jigs!

5077
03:02:54,940 --> 03:02:55,080
Jigs!

5078
03:02:56,720 --> 03:02:57,580
Holy shit!

5079
03:02:57,700 --> 03:02:58,560
That was so loud!

5080
03:02:58,880 --> 03:02:59,720
Yeah, sorry guys.

5081
03:03:00,100 --> 03:03:01,780
Sorry guys, that was really loud.

5082
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:04,480
I was like, what am I supposed to look?

5083
03:03:04,520 --> 03:03:05,420
I don't understand!

5084
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:09,440
I looked away!

5085
03:03:09,660 --> 03:03:10,040
No!

5086
03:03:11,380 --> 03:03:12,760
I didn't know!

5087
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:13,120
No!

5088
03:03:15,100 --> 03:03:16,360
Alright, but yes, this is me.

5089
03:03:16,380 --> 03:03:17,520
Yo, yo, can we disconnect now already?

5090
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:18,560
This is me.

5091
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:21,280
This is my custom skin.

5092
03:03:22,100 --> 03:03:25,080
You can also get the skin just like this.

5093
03:03:25,460 --> 03:03:26,980
This is actually my OG skin.

5094
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:28,200
I've had this skin for years.

5095
03:03:28,600 --> 03:03:35,080
I've actually I've had this skin since I had a Minecraft account.

5096
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:37,820
So it's like actual OG.

5097
03:03:37,880 --> 03:03:39,280
It's not like I put it on.

5098
03:03:39,460 --> 03:03:42,460
It's not like I put this on like 3-6 months ago.

5099
03:03:42,760 --> 03:03:45,880
I actually had this skin like for the last 5-6 years.

5100
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:51,860
I've always been a bear.

5101
03:03:52,660 --> 03:03:54,080
So I never changed it.

5102
03:03:55,420 --> 03:03:57,320
I've never changed this skin.

5103
03:03:58,120 --> 03:04:01,760
Just another skin suit.

5104
03:04:02,380 --> 03:04:09,620
Alright, if anyone wants to make a custom skin for me, it has to have the qualities of the bear skin.

5105
03:04:10,360 --> 03:04:12,740
It has to have parts of the bear skin, guys.

5106
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:14,280
That's all I ask for.

5107
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:21,280
It has to have some qualities of this.

5108
03:04:21,740 --> 03:04:23,200
Guys, that's all I ask.

5109
03:04:24,560 --> 03:04:27,280
It's like, it's part of the part of my lore.

5110
03:04:27,580 --> 03:04:28,900
I've always been a bear.

5111
03:04:29,880 --> 03:04:33,960
Before the skin suit, I had a bear skin suit.

5112
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:36,180
But not in a furry type of way.

5113
03:04:38,660 --> 03:04:39,640
I'm just saying.

5114
03:04:39,900 --> 03:04:41,280
It was just in Minecraft.

5115
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:42,620
Just in Minecraft.

5116
03:04:44,440 --> 03:04:46,100
Just in Minecraft, guys.

5117
03:04:46,380 --> 03:04:47,780
I just thought it was cute.

5118
03:04:47,920 --> 03:04:48,560
Just in Minecraft.

5119
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:50,640
Alright guys, now I actually have to go now.

5120
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:52,500
I'll see you guys later, everybody.

5121
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:53,700
Bye guys!

5122
03:04:54,740 --> 03:04:55,140
Bye!
