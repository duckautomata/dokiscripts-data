00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,020
Hello!

3
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,280
Hi!

4
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,460
Welcome to singing lessons!

5
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,620
Welcome here!

6
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,420
Yeah, I'm gonna be getting singing lessons from Yu-san!

7
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,540
Hey!

8
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,000
We have a concert together soon.

9
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,340
When is it?

10
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
When is the concert?

11
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
August 4th.

12
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,380
Oh my god, that's really close.

13
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah, let's watch.

14
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
It's pretty soon.

15
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,660
That's like in...

16
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,160
Like in a week.

17
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
Listen to!

18
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,240
It's a week and two days!

19
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,160
I didn't even realize it was that close.

20
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,300
Guys, even though the concert is in like a week and two days, I'm gonna get my singing lessons now.

21
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,400
Yeah.

22
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,280
Yu-san, do you think I have enough time?

23
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,920
The more you practice, you will be a better singer.

24
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,220
This is gonna be my only practice, guys.

25
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,360
And then I'll...

26
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,940
Oh my god.

27
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,560
Because I know Yu-san is gonna teach me so well that I only need one practice, right?

28
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,740
Okay, okay, okay.

29
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Let me defend myself real quick, okay?

30
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
Wait, why would you defend yourself?

31
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,340
You're a great teacher, aren't you?

32
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,480
No, okay, so...

33
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,240
What does that sound bad?

34
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,680
What I'm gonna be...

35
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,820
Shut up.

36
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,860
What I'm gonna be sharing right now is not 100% recommended, okay?

37
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Wait, what?

38
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,200
It's not also...

39
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,120
No, no, no, no.

40
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,860
It doesn't mean like...

41
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,960
It doesn't mean like it's not dangerous at all, okay?

42
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:17,420
I mean, I can guarantee even you follow this, you're gonna be a good singer or whatever because everyone have their own method, okay?

43
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,020
But you're such a great singer.

44
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,380
You should be able to transfer your skills to me.

45
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,500
Okay, you say that.

46
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,340
Okay, you say that.

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,360
You say that.

48
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,180
Yeah, you say that.

49
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,860
Wait, was...

50
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,420
I don't listen to your song.

51
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,480
It was like, whoa.

52
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,580
Now you did that.

53
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,820
Now you did that by yourself.

54
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,020
Okay, I hope you don't get a regret for that.

55
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,580
I thought you were gonna teach me.

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Okay, okay, but I tell you, my vocal lesson is extreme, okay?

57
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,860
It's extreme?

58
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,540
So does that mean I'll be like a really good singer after you're done?

59
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,380
I thought you want to be a good singer.

60
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,600
I mean, what is the reason you're asking me to do the vocal lesson?

61
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,620
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,560
Because you're gonna give me...

63
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,260
I'm gonna be able to sing just like you after this lesson is over, right?

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,680
If it's that extreme.

65
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,420
Maybe you need to practice like a ten... ten... not ten years or like plus.

66
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,020
Ten years?

67
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,540
Ten or...

68
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,580
I don't have that much time.

69
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,500
Oh, please don't underestimate my singing skill.

70
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,840
You don't know how much I'm better for this.

71
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
But like, the food.

72
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,160
I want it now.

73
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,500
I don't want it ten years.

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,980
Okay, so after this, after this, as an exchange, you have to give me the gaming lesson.

75
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,300
And not just the stream.

76
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,540
You gotta be responsible.

77
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,240
My gaming lessons is a talent.

78
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,620
All of my gaming techniques is all good.

79
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,360
All of my...

80
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:45,980
Yeah.

81
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,220
Sorry, gaming... gaming is a talent.

82
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,760
It's not... you can't just become a gamer.

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,280
You have to be born like a...

84
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,180
You have to be born a gamer.

85
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,560
I'm tired.

86
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,880
I'm tired.

87
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh my god.

88
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,300
Holy shit.

89
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,020
There's no such thing as gaming.

90
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,260
Oh my god.

91
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,600
There's no such thing as gaming lessons.

92
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,780
But there's singing lessons.

93
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,200
Strange.

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,240
Okay, I'll try my best to make you a good singer after this.

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,700
Yay!

96
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,880
So one day you have to make me an apex legend.

97
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,460
Well, like, if you're not born with it, then I don't know if I can.

98
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,700
You have to be...

99
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,320
I told you, you have to be born a gamer.

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,420
You saw me.

101
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,900
Oh, fuck that.

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,420
What about you?

103
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,080
Did you born... did you born as a singer as well?

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,800
No, no, no.

105
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,020
I was born a gamer.

106
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,940
No, that's why there's singing lessons.

107
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,660
There's no gaming lessons.

108
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,500
There's singing lessons.

109
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,400
So what is the whole point of this lesson?

110
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,400
Cause you're gonna teach me how to sing.

111
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,460
Gaming and singing is very different.

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Okay.

114
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,060
Whatever.

115
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,240
Let's do the warm up.

116
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,260
Alright, before we warm up.

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,140
How's the volume, guys?

118
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,460
I don't know if my sound guy is on today.

119
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,420
So how's the volume chat?

120
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,180
You know what?

121
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,620
Modder... my other mod...

122
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,040
My other mod, you're gonna be the sound guy for now.

123
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,020
Because I don't know if the...

124
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,360
If our sound guy is here today.

125
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,660
You guys gotta be the sound tech guys.

126
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,680
Oh, okay.

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,340
Never mind.

128
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,000
I have one of my sound guys here.

129
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,880
The Discord sound guy.

130
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,960
Oh, wait.

131
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,020
My other sound guy is also here.

132
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,400
The two sound guys.

133
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,120
Sound keeper, let's go.

134
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,020
Yeah.

135
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,740
Alright.

136
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,720
Alright.

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,260
Can you say something, Yu-san?

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,100
Just real quick.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,820
Scream for me.

140
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,500
Yell for me.

141
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,020
Oh.

142
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,580
Oh god.

143
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:42,740
Okay.

144
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,160
Whoa.

145
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,060
What did you say?

146
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,700
I just speak the random...

147
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,200
Oh.

148
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,100
Alright.

149
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,380
We're ready.

150
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,820
What's my first lesson?

151
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,080
Okay.

152
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,020
So...

153
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,820
We're gonna be doing the warm up.

154
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,560
Okay.

155
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:58,920
Okay?

156
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,760
But I don't like waiting you.

157
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,040
What you have to do is just follow exactly what I'm doing.

158
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,180
Okay.

159
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,280
And chat.

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,700
You're gonna watch her.

161
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,460
Please watch her that she's not slacking out.

162
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm not slacking.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,220
I'm a hard worker.

164
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,740
Yeah.

165
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,340
Okay.

166
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,340
We'll see that.

167
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,020
What?

168
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,840
We'll see that.

169
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,060
Okay.

170
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,120
With exceptions.

171
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,380
With exceptions.

172
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,500
Okay.

173
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,960
I'm gonna change the Discord setting real quick.

174
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,460
Okay.

175
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,560
Cool.

176
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,220
Uh.

177
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,720
Yeah.

178
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,280
Okay.

179
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,340
I'm gonna just start like just everything just by my own timing.

180
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,620
So.

181
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,460
Just follow me.

182
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,120
Okay?

183
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,740
If you're follow...

184
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,300
Oh my god.

185
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,520
I can't.

186
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,820
I don't.

187
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,080
I can't.

188
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,540
I don't.

189
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,660
We don't hear you.

190
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,380
We don't hear you.

191
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,180
What did

192
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:02,880
I do?

193
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,560
What did I do?

194
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,130
Now you hear me, right?

195
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,590
Yeah.

196
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:13,810
Yeah.

197
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,510
Yeah.

198
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,350
We can hear you now.

199
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,510
When you played that we just stopped hearing you.

200
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,310
We couldn't hear you when you played it.

201
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,110
Whenever you were trying to play.

202
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:24,970
Oh!

203
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,990
We don't hear you anymore.

204
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,770
We don't hear you anymore.

205
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,070
Oh!

206
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,170
Shit!

207
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,030
Wait.

208
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,410
Output device.

209
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,530
Wait.

210
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,010
Oh my god.

211
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,310
Wait.

212
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,630
Ah.

213
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:42,730
Sorry.

214
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,610
Do you hear me?

215
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:43,990
Yeah.

216
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,650
I can hear you now.

217
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,710
Wait.

218
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,990
Wait.

219
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,530
Wait.

220
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:47,930
Wait.

221
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,070
Wait.

222
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,410
Can I play some random music?

223
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:51,850
Yeah.

224
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,090
Yeah.

225
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,290
Yeah.

226
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,430
Yeah.

227
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,850
It's okay.

228
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,970
I'm indie.

229
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,710
It doesn't matter.

230
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,370
Oh my god.

231
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,590
Do you hear the music?

232
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,550
No.

233
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,180
Do you?

234
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,840
No.

235
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,140
No.

236
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,160
Right.

237
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,660
No.

238
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,220
No.

239
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,180
Wait.

240
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,260
It worked.

241
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,520
Oh.

242
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,220
Oh.

243
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,860
We don't hear you anymore.

244
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,500
We don't hear you anymore.

245
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,560
I hear myself.

246
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,220
I hear myself.

247
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,020
Hey girl.

248
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,640
Hey girl.

249
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,080
Okay.

250
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,300
Now.

251
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,080
What the fuck is happening here?

252
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,140
Are?

253
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,240
I hear you again.

254
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,760
I hear you again.

255
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,300
It's time.

256
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,120
It's time.

257
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,680
Oh.

258
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,180
Oh.

259
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,680
Oh.

260
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,480
Oh.

261
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:40,620
Oh.

262
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,250
We don't hear you.

263
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:45,850
We don't hear you.

264
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,210
I hear myself though.

265
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,990
I hear myself though.

266
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,750
Hey girl.

267
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,370
Hey girl.

268
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,030
Okay.

269
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,430
So now I am at the voice setting now.

270
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,670
And I'm going to be the voice setting.

271
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,070
Okay.

272
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,610
Okay.

273
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,410
I'm a boomer.

274
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,130
You're going to carry me.

275
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,330
Okay?

276
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,750
It's alright.

277
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,630
It's okay guys.

278
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,730
Today is also technical lessons day too.

279
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,710
It's alright.

280
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,290
It's okay guys.

281
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,290
Today is also technical lessons day too.

282
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,090
Okay.

283
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,510
So for the voice setting, input device is the chat mic.

284
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:08,950
Now.

285
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,530
And I believe we have to use the And I believe we have to use the broadcast stream mix.

286
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:15,890
Right?

287
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,710
Yeah.

288
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,550
But we don't hear you.

289
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,290
But we don't hear you.

290
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,490
I hear me.

291
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,130
I hear me.

292
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,110
Maybe your input mic is not on the broadcast.

293
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,570
Is not on the broadcast.

294
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,660
We're still...

295
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,900
We're still... We still hear me only.

296
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,600
We still hear me only.

297
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,780
Shit.

298
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,700
How do I do that?

299
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,660
I'm sorry guys.

300
00:12:59,660 --> 00:12:59,960
It's okay.

301
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,760
It's okay guys.

302
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,720
We're figuring.

303
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,440
It's tech support.

304
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,280
I'm not streaming through my setup.

305
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,780
Okay?

306
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,360
So yeah.

307
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,980
You know, gotta be patient for that.

308
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,600
We're going to fiddle around.

309
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,960
No, I just checked it.

310
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,220
It's actually a broadcast stream mix.

311
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,460
Yeah, but I think your mic isn't attached to your broadcast stream mix.

312
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,500
It could be separated.

313
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
You can check it.

314
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,560
If it's separated.

315
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,330
Does the setup use... Does that work?

316
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,730
GoXLR?

317
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,990
I don't know if you're talking.

318
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,370
Hello?

319
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,210
I don't hear me now though at least.

320
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,090
You hear me now, right?

321
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,910
Yeah, I hear you now.

322
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,830
Did you...

323
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,670
Is that setup GoXLR?

324
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,490
You know what, Doki?

325
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,050
Fuck that.

326
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,890
We're gonna...

327
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,570
Okay!

328
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,130
Okay!

329
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,050
Okay, I'm gonna send you the link!

330
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,670
Okay!

331
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,170
I'm gonna send you the link, okay?

332
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,630
And you're gonna do that.

333
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:12,030
You don't have to, you know, show this video on your stream, but you know, just sing along this one.

334
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,590
It's in Japanese, but just follow the sound.

335
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,130
Okay, okay, I'll play...

336
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,590
You're gonna play it too, right?

337
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,930
So we're both listening to it at the same time?

338
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,470
Are you sure about that?

339
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,810
Are you sure you wanna do that?

340
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,810
I don't know what I'm doing!

341
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,030
What about... Okay, okay, okay.

342
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,610
Sure, sure, sure, sure!

343
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,570
I'm gonna be doing that too.

344
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,590
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

345
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,550
I'll do a count... You do a countdown, I'll play it at the same time.

346
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,690
Okay, ready?

347
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,190
Yeah.

348
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,050
3, 2, 1...

349
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,760
Okay.

350
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,840
Oh...

351
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,520
Welcome here.

352
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,600
I don't know...

353
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
Don't worry, it's gonna be fun.

354
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,980
Okay, the rip roll!

355
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,600
Rip roll.

356
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200

Make it long!

361
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,300
RIP ROLL!

362
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,610
Do it longer, longer, longer!

363
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:16,950
Okay.

364
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,230
Have fun!

365
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,450
Are you ready?

366
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,070
1, 2, 3, 4!

367
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,450
RIP ROLL!

368
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,740
Mountain?

369
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,860
RIP ROLL!

370
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,180
RIP ROLL!

371
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,060
You're climbing up the mountain!

372
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,960
Okay!

373
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,760
I don't want to climb the mountain!

374
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,800
Yeah?

375
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,280
How do you feel?

376
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,020
I don't wanna climb the mountain.

377
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,040
Come on, it's a warm up!

378
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,600
Okay.

379
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,900
Okay?

380
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,980
I'm humming.

381
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,940
Don't laugh, don't laugh.

382
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,240
You're laughing.

383
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,160
I'm trying to do it!

384
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,420
It's so hard.

385
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,440
Up and up and up and down and up and up.

386
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,420
Up and up and up and up and up.

387
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,580
Okay, good.

388
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,760
Okay, now you just follow the sound here, okay?

389
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,240
Zwe-ji-tsu-da-dee-zi-zoo-zaz-la-da-da.

390
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,860
Da-de-ji-zu-da-dee-zi-zoo.

391
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,440
Ba-bee-boo ba-ba-bee-boo.

392
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,120
Okay, meow!

393
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,600
No, big cat!

394
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,620
Your cat!

395
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,540
Meow!

396
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,060
Okay, guys.

397
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,280
Okay, now your dog.

398
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Okay.

399
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,640
Okay?

400
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,120
Aaaaaaaaa.

401
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,400
Second time.

402
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,700
Aaaaaaaaaaa.

403
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,160
Higher.

404
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,280
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa.

405
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,540
Another time.

406
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,400
We get higher too.

407
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,700
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa.

408
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,600
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa.

409
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,020
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa.

410
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,820
Two more times.

411
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,380
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa.

412
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,280
Last time.

413
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,800
Come on, you got this!

414
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,860
Three times, but the short one, okay?

415
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,510
Breathing.

416
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,150
Yeah!

417
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,690
Okay, we're done.

418
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,230
We're done.

419
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,230
Okay, stop there.

420
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,610
Stop there.

421
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,210
That was hard.

422
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,590
That was really hard.

423
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,370
That was a warm up.

424
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,690
That was so warm up.

425
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,390
Come on, you wanna be the real singer after this stream, right?

426
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,750
That was so hard.

427
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,570
Why do you think it's gonna be easy?

428
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,870
Why did you thought it's gonna be easy?

429
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,530
Come on.

430
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,110
I thought it was gonna be easy.

431
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,250
Singing is never easy.

432
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:05,810
Come on.

433
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,290
Singing is not easy.

434
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:14,150
Even though you're good at singing, it doesn't guarantee to make you famous as well.

435
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,050
Singing here, the music industry is fucked up.

436
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,150
Why are you crying?

437
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:23,990
Look's up!

438
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,390
But I wanna be a good singer.

439
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,490
But I wanna be a good singer.

440
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,090
Now!

441
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,870
Okay, everybody, thanks for coming.

442
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,770
Okay, Doki gave up for the warm up round.

443
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,670
No, I didn't give up!

444
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,070
She doesn't wanna do it anymore.

445
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,130
No, I didn't give up!

446
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:51,630
I just think... I just think if you are an amazing teacher, you can make me a great singer in one lesson.

447
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,350
Okay.

448
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,790
Okay.

449
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,370
Okay.

450
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:53,770
Okay.

451
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,790
Fill up my ego.

452
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,370
You can fill up my ego.

453
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,390
Tell me more.

454
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,190
You're an amazing singer.

455
00:20:59,170 --> 00:20:59,810
Okay.

456
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,490
And you're so talented.

457
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:08,970
So that means you can easily make other people just as talented, but not as talented as you.

458
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,790
Just a little bit less talented than you, but still just as talented.

459
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,750
Okay, I'm not smart enough to understand what you actually say, but...

460
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,750
Okay.

461
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,210
Okay.

462
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,150
Okay.

463
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,230
Okay.

464
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:44,870
You don't have to worry.

465
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,530
Okay, so um...

466
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:53,290
Okay, so, just as much as I know...

467
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,450
Okay!

468
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,490
You don't have to make up all the��ogical opinions!

469
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,670
empin tension About what?

470
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:21,550
So, this training will actually teach you how to release your tension from your throat.

471
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:21,990
Okay.

472
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,470
Yeah?

473
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,090
So, okay, on the Discord, I send you video, right?

474
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,590
And there is the chat says, vocal ventilation.

476
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,070
Vocal ventilation.

477
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:35,630
Yeah.

478
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,590
Vocal vent- I see vibrato- oh, vocal expa- expansion?

479
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,070
Not the expansion, ventilation.

480
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,530
There's a ventilation.

481
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,590
Didn't I send it that?

482
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,770
No, you didn't.

483
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,210
I know, I know.

484
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:47,590
Didn't I?

485
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,110
You didn't give me ventilation.

486
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,850
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

487
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:50,910
I know, hold on a moment.

488
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,870
Vibrato, pitch accuracy- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

489
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,950
Hold on a moment.

490
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,130
I think I sent it already.

491
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,290
Oh, but you never- you didn't match it.

492
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,270
You didn't give me a word for it.

493
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,850
Oh, I did, I did, I did.

494
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,350
Hold on a moment.

495
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,450
I will just send you the- I will just send you now, you know, because I'm a good teacher.

496
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,170
Yay!

497
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:11,510
Yeah.

498
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,270
You're such a good teacher.

499
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,830
I'm an awesome teacher, so hold on a moment.

500
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,590
Just a moment.

501
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,130
Just a moment.

502
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,990
Just a moment.

503
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,250
Just a moment, a moment.

504
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,950
I'm just a moment?

505
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,890
I'm just a moment?

506
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,250
Just a moment?

507
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:27,710
Yeah.

508
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,350
It's awesome.

509
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,470
Don't you think it's awesome?

510
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,190
Like, every time I'm doing the vocal lesson, I mean, it's definitely my first time doing a vocal lesson.

511
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,530
Yeah!

512
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,690
I can tell.

513
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,630
It's 100% my first time, you know, giving someone a vocal lesson.

514
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,910
But, yeah, every time I am preparing the video for them.

515
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,290
Yeah, yeah.

516
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:56,010
So they can just follow the note along the piano line that I play.

517
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,390
Yeah, because we have a piano right here!

518
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,550
Yeah!

519
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,790
That's why we have a piano here!

520
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,310
Okay.

521
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,650
Can you play that?

522
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,510
Yeah, okay.

523
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,630
I'm...

524
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,990
I'm waiting for notes to come out.

525
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:15,690
Oh!

526
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,710
I hear it.

527
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,630
So you hear...

528
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,450
It's...

529
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,030
It's getting weak to stronger, right?

530
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,390
Yeah.

531
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:33,130
So when you heard the sound, I want you to...

532
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,870
Emphasize the sound.

533
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,310
Like, every time you say.

534
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,230
But, from now...

535
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,950
I want you to tongue out.

536
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,690
Eh.

537
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,570
Eh.

538
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,970
You don't have a tongue, do you?

539
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,870
I don't have a tongue.

540
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,930
My tongue muscles doesn't go that far.

541
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,150
No, no, no.

542
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,570
I mean...

543
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,150
It's because I have a very short tongue, Yusong.

544
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,070
So like...

545
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,590
No, no, no.

546
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:56,610
Wait.

547
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,730
Your tongue is super long.

548
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,370
That's why it comes out of your mouth.

549
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,190
My tongue is super short.

550
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,230
So it doesn't...

551
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,250
You don't have a tongue, do you?

552
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,470
It doesn't... No, I don't have a long enough tongue.

553
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,490
Your tongue is like super long like a lizard.

554
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:09,930
It's not!

555
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:10,930
Hahaha!

556
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,050
Hahaha!

557
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,010
My tongue is super short.

558
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,210
My tongue is super...

559
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,590
Fuck that!

560
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,970
Anyway, okay.

561
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,270
I'm sorry, Dragoon.

562
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,370
But, you know, I...

563
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,070
You know, at least you get to hear the sound.

564
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,210
So just appreciate me already.

565
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:27,890
Okay?

566
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,270
So...

567
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,490
Do it like...

568
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:30,750
Ah.

569
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,750
Ah.

570
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,630
Ah.

571
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,490
Ah.

572
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,210
Ah.

573
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,790
Then make it louder.

574
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,630
Yeah?

575
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,110
Ah.

576
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,090
Ah.

577
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,370
Ah.

578
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,150
Ah.

579
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,950
Ah.

580
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,090
Ah.

581
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,310
Ah.

582
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,710
Ah.

583
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:41,890
Ah.

584
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,430
Like that.

585
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,280
Follow the piano!

586
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,440
Yeah?

587
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,520
Follow the piano!

588
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,100
Okay.

589
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,440
That's what you do.

590
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:50,960
Okay?

591
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,720
Tongue out, okay?

592
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,220
Ah.

593
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,060
Ah.

594
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,740
Ah.

595
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,720
Ah.

596
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,200
Ah.

597
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,420
Ah.

598
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,770
Okay, don't make...

599
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,290
Okay, okay.

600
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:04,870
I'm serious.

601
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,510
I'm serious.

602
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:05,950
I'm serious too!

603
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,730
Don't make it a joke.

604
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,010
Yeah, this is a serious listen.

605
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,990
I'm trying.

606
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,610
I'm trying.

607
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,710
I'm trying my best!

608
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,370
I'm trying to let you get a Grammy!

609
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,590
You know?

610
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:14,950
Ah.

611
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,230
Ah.

612
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,770
Ah.

613
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:15,930
Ah.

614
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,550
You think I can get a Grammy?

615
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,230
Ah.

616
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,910
Ah.

617
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,750
Ah.

618
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,550
Ah.

619
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,270
Ah.

620
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:22,690
Ah.

621
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,310
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

622
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,810
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

623
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,810
What?

624
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,670
No, not a Grammy.

625
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,790
From a diaphragm!

626
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,150
Ah.

627
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,990
Ah.

628
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:31,930
Ah.

629
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:32,710
Ah.

630
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,510
Ah.

631
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,410
Ah.

632
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:35,410
Ah.

633
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,070
Ahhhhhhhh!

634
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,720
Don't give up on me!

635
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,780
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

636
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,340
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

637
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,020
Oh no, my tongue touched the mic, that's so gross!

638
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Okay, I think you have to tongue out more, you know, like...

639
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,060
The video's over...

640
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,040
Is the video volume okay?

641
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,120
Why are you laughing?!

642
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,460
You said you're laughing!

643
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,960
This is not fair!

644
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,880
Why can't you just stop laughing?!

645
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,820
Why did the teacher laugh at me?!

646
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,460
The teacher should not be allowed to laugh at their students!

647
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,400
That's messed up!

648
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,900
I'm sorry, Doki.

649
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,420
There is no such a lesson exists like this.

650
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,320
I just made it up.

651
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,020
What you made of this lesson?!

652
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,380
That's fucked up!

653
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,080
That's fucked up!

654
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Oh my god, seriously!

655
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,980
I hope your Live2D creators watching this...

656
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,760
So, you know, I hope they're gonna get you a new toggle...

657
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,420
I hope I never get a longer tongue.

658
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,340
I hope my tongue remains short forever.

659
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,620
Come on, we need your tongue out.

660
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,480
Nooooo!

661
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm not gonna use my tongue for just this?!

662
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,560
Like, what else am I gonna use it for?!

663
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,480
You're still using it!

664
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,020
Tongue!

665
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,040
It's pretty useful!

666
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:41,560
Like...

667
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,260
Like what?!

668
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,840
Like what?!

669
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,620
Doki, look at me.

670
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,180
Look at me.

671
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,520
Huh?

672
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,640
Yeah.

673
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,320
What the fuck?

674
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,000
Like...

675
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,760
What's the use?!

676
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,380
What?!

677
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,240
You don't feel irritated?

678
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,220
I was counting on you.

679
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,060
Well, anyway.

680
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,600
Okay.

681
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,420
Um...

682
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,800
Joke aside, I say that this...

683
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,420
I just made up this training, right?

684
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,060
Yeah.

685
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,880
But, um... actually, the real professional singer, they also do a lot of tongue trainings too.

686
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,880
Because it helps to improve your pronunciations.

687
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,700
Uh-huh.

688
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,360
And also the breath control.

689
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,260
So, I recommend you doing this actually.

690
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,380
Oh, okay.

691
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,080
Yeah.

692
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,500
I made it up, but it still work.

693
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,700
Okay.

694
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,080
Oh!

695
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,300
Oh, so it's still actually training me!

696
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,160
It's... ah, yeah.

697
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,620
I was actually training you.

698
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,120
Oh my god!

699
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,920
I knew it!

700
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:34,940
I knew you would...

701
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,560
And also making fun of you at the same time.

702
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,100
Oh, okay.

703
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,460
Nevermind.

704
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,800
Oh... okay.

705
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,760
It's like that movie!

706
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,020
You know that movie about that drummer guy?

707
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,640
Where, like, the teacher's super harsh on him, but then it's because he only wants him to improve more?

708
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,980
Is that it?

709
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,920
Is that what you're trying to do?

710
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,680
You're making fun of me?

711
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,140
Oh...

712
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,920
No, I'm just trying to think about, like, how to make it as a content.

713
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,460
That's all.

714
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:03,760
Oh, no.

715
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh, no.

716
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,860
Oh, no.

717
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,960
Oh, no.

718
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,380
Okay.

719
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Okay, you're not trying to make me a better... you're not trying to make me a stronger singer.

720
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,280
I see.

721
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,300
I see.

722
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,500
Okay, so that was the vocal ventilation.

723
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,840
Basically focusing on how to relax your throat and also, you know, release any tension from your throat.

724
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,760
Okay.

725
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,000
Okay.

726
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,180
And after that, let's move on to vibrato.

727
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:32,980
Okay.

728
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,840
You know what vibrato is?

729
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,160
Uh, vib... vib... vibrato?

730
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,760
No.

731
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,460
Vibrato.

732
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,760
What is it?

733
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,440
Uh, for example.

734
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,180
Okay.

735
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,280
Ponyo, right?

736
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,920
Yeah.

737
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,760
Ponyo, ponyo, ponyo, pa-na-na-na.

738
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,920
Yeah.

739
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,800
Whoa!

740
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,140
Ponyo, ponyo, ponyo, sakana no ko.

741
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,860
That's not vibrato.

742
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,900
But if I put the vibrato...

743
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,560
Ponyo, ponyo, ponyo, sakana no ko.

744
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,460
Oh my god.

745
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,200
I can't do that.

746
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,900
Ko!

747
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:05,940
Ko!

748
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,720
Sakana no ko!

749
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,660
Ko!

750
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,620
Oh!

751
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,360
That one.

752
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,760
That one.

753
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,220
You hear the wave, right?

754
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,600
That's the vibrato.

755
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

756
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,900
You wanna do that?

757
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,080
Sure, I'll try.

758
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,880
I don't think... I don't know if I can.

759
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,340
Okay, so if you're able to do vibrato, your singing's gonna sound slightly better, okay?

760
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,480
Oh, just slightly?

761
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,300
Just a little bit?

762
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,440
A lot better!

763
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,900
A lot better!

764
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,540
Yeah?

765
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,200
How about that?

766
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,720
A lot better!

767
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,300
Yeah?

768
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:43,860
That's good.

769
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,880
Alright.

770
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,320
Okay.

771
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,560
So...

772
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,320
I also sent you the video there, right?

773
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:48,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,380
I see it.

775
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,780
Oh, I hear it!

776
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,080
Okay.

777
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,480
Yeah, I hear it.

778
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,060
Ah!

779
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,060
Ah!

780
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,800
Ah!

781
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Ah!

782
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,640
Ah!

783
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,480
Ah!

784
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,480
So... Ah!

785
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,500
There was like a shape— —Of a wave there.

786
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,400
So focus on doing a, That one.

787
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,020
Yeah.

788
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,860
Shake it.

789
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,740
I can't do— That's too fast.

790
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,100
Okay.

791
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,720
Do you watch— Do you watch...

792
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,280
Joe's?

793
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,800
Joe's?

794
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,900
Doors!

795
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,760
Oh!

796
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,680
You're sharks.

797
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,040
Yeah.

798
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,980
Okay, are you ready to... are you ready to do that with a piano scale?

800
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:48,840
Yeah!

801
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,320
Okay!

802
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,520
Let's do that.

803
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,760
Do I push play?

804
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,760
Me?

805
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,420
Me?

806
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,580
Yeah!

807
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,940
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

808
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,960
Yeah, so people can hear you playing the sound, right?

809
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,540
Okay.

810
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:03,560
Yeah.

811
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,440
So people will know that you're not slacking out as well.

812
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,280
You can say other things too.

813
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,920
Did I do it?

814
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,200
Yeah.

815
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,420
Keep going, keep going.

816
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:41,780
Yay!

817
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,220
Oh, it stopped.

818
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,940
It ended.

819
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,220
Wait, what did you stop for?

820
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,760
Did I... Oh, wait, oh, I... No, no, no, I pressed the wrong button.

821
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,840
Oh, oh, oh!

822
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,830
Shake your voices, shake your shake your librarians.

823
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,630
Oh, oh, oh.

824
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,220
You're doing awesome.

825
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,980
You're doing awesome.

826
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,660
Yay!

827
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,060
I did it.

828
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,220
I did it.

829
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,160
Did you follow the piano scale actually?

830
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,660
Yeah!

831
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,280
What do you mean?

832
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,200
It's getting higher.

833
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,860
The notes are getting higher.

834
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,160
But your sound, your notes is like constantly like same key.

835
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:39,800
What?

836
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,120
Oh, you did it well!

837
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

838
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,580
Very good!

839
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,040
A+.

840
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,600
You did it well.

841
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,180
I didn't know.

842
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,060
I thought I was singing higher.

843
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,400
So good.

844
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,740
Okay, do you wanna drink some water?

845
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,720
Okay.

846
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,600
I'm doing my best.

847
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,660
You're doing... Of course!

848
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,880
Baby, baby, you're doing okay!

849
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,300
Baby, you're...

850
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,140
I need positive reinforcement.

851
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,260
The more you compliment me, the better I'll do.

852
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,240
Oh, you can expect that from me.

853
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,340
Yeah?

854
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,460
Really?

855
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,620
You can expect that from me.

856
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,400
Yeah, how are you being positive right now?

857
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,180
You're not being very positive, so that makes me sad.

858
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,240
I'm super positive!

859
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:27,880
You know?

860
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,800
I see only the improvement from here, you know?

861
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,260
Really?

862
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,400
How do you improve?

863
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:38,500
I only see the potentials... I only see a lot of potential improving from here, you know what I mean?

864
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,960
Yeah, how did I... from here, so I wasn't improving before?

865
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,820
Now you're at the... okay.

866
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,220
Now you're probably at the lowest bottom, but...

867
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,020
I'm at the lowest bottom?

868
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,620
That means you have a lot of sign of... you have a sign of improvement, you know what I mean?

869
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,260
That means I'd be like one tier...

870
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,180
If this is not a compliment, I don't know what it is.

871
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,420
You told me I'm

872
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,190
the...

873
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,930
Think about it, think about it.

874
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,970
That means I'm at the bottom!

875
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,930
Okay, think about it.

876
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,930
If you're at the lowest bottom, you're not going any lower, you know?

877
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,810
You're not going any lower than that.

878
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,010
You're not gonna fail from that.

879
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,650
But I'm still at the bottom!

880
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,650
You were only new to Go Up.

881
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,970
I'm still at the bottom!

882
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,510
You know what?

883
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:20,790
Yeah, now!

884
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,810
Now!

885
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:20,810
Now!

886
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,050
Who else is at the bottom?

887
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,870
Well, you can just go up from future.

888
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,330
Children!

889
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,010
Children are at the bottom!

890
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,450
But you're comparing me to a child!

891
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,610
Are children better singers than me?

892
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,570
Oh, you can't say anything because you have to be positive.

893
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,870
That's fucked up!

894
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,730
You don't say anything because you have to be positive!

895
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,630
That is so fucked up!

896
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,650
It's because you just twist anything I say!

897
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,390
You're just like, oh my god.

898
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,430
Even when I try my best to, I'm like, oh, I don't know.

899
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,010
Trigger!

900
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,210
It's not my fault!

901
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,610
It's not my fault!

902
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,170
I don't know, man!

903
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:06,890
I don't know, man!

904
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,490
Oh god.

905
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,930
Okay, so that was the...

906
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,210
What's next in the singing lesson?

907
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,070
What do you have next?

908
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,670
Pitch accuracy.

909
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:20,570
Oh!

910
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,930
Maybe I'll be good at that.

911
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,830
So, okay, so good singer.

912
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,410
Like me?

913
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,230
They don't need mix.

914
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,390
Oh, not like me.

915
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Are you confident that you can hit every note, like, correctly all the time?

916
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,160
Because when you're singing in live, there's no mixer.

917
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,160
There's no... there's, you know, autotune or there's nobody who can actually collect your tune and pitches, you know?

918
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,820
Yeah.

919
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,680
So the good singer, they always have to sing in the right pitch.

920
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,040
So the pitch accuracy practice is really necessary and it's really important for them.

921
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Okay, so that's not me, basically.

922
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,700
You just started, yeah?

923
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,600
Yeah, like today.

924
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,440
Nobody's good from the beginning.

925
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,740
I've never sang before until today, so all I can do is improve.

926
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,320
Nobody's good from the beginning.

927
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,800
Yeah.

928
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,520
Yeah?

929
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,720
Yeah, not even you.

930
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,140
That's fair.

931
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,060
Yeah!

932
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,880
Exactly.

933
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,300
Yeah.

934
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,420
Exactly.

935
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,620
So you're saying just like... so your singing was just like mine?

936
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,860
You saw it?

937
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,080
Oh my god, did I just got insulted?

938
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,580
You literally said nobody's singing.

939
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,220
Are you trying to sing?!

940
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,900
Why?

941
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,900
What are you trying to sing about my singing?

942
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:47,740
Did I just get insulted?

943
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,020
What do you mean, something?!

944
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:58,020
You can say that, you can say that if you're going to just stop singing Disney or Ghibli, and just sing the other song.

945
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,760
I meant that these songs are so hard.

946
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,060
The other song...

947
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,940
Whatever it is.

948
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,920
Whatever it is.

949
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,160
What is that?

950
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:07,900
Okay.

951
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,660
They're also in Japanese.

952
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,560
I can't sing the...

953
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,620
Okay.

954
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,820
You can just say anything.

955
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,780
I can hear it when you did that.

956
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,880
Yeah.

957
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,700
Me...

958
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,780
It's because I'm playing through my iPad.

959
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,540
Oh.

960
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,780
Because I have keyboard on my iPad.

961
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,180
Okay?

962
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,180
Okay.

963
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,940
I was gonna say, I could hear it.

964
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,480
Me, me, me, me, me.

965
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,200
Me, me, me, me, me.

966
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,040
That's what you do.

967
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,260
Okay.

968
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,960
I'll show you now.

969
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:39,900
Okay.

970
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,600
Me, me, me, me, me.

971
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,760
Me, me, me, me, me.

972
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,660
Can be anything.

973
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,840
La, la, la, la, la.

974
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,900
La, la, la, la, la.

975
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,660
And it's getting higher every time.

976
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,080
La, la, la, la, la.

977
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,120
La, la, la, la, la.

978
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,400
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

979
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,460
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

980
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,360
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

981
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,320
Yeah.

982
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,480
Something like that.

983
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,700
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

984
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,020
I want you to do that with the video I sent you.

985
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,780
Okay.

986
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,540
You can just say anything.

987
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,360
Okay.

988
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,200
I'll play it now.

989
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,620
Do, do, do, do, do.

990
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,400
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

991
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,560
Wa, ba, ba, ba.

992
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,660
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

993
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,580
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

994
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,820
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

995
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,760
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

996
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,040
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

997
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,480
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

998
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,320
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

999
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,940
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

1000
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:45,960
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

1001
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,800
Focus on hitting the right pitch.

1002
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1003
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1004
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1005
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1006
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1007
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1008
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,280
Not bad, to be honest.

1009
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,480
Okay, focus on hitting the right pitch.

1010
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,860
That's out of tune.

1011
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,840
Good, good.

1012
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,340
Not bad, actually.

1013
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,020
Yeah, see I can have good pitch!

1014
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:22,440
Yeah, this practice, you should focus on hitting the right pitch.

1015
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:29,680
So, you know, it's not anything about training, training your vocal muscle or...

1016
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,540
not like that.

1017
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,860
It's more like training your music sense.

1018
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,800
Uh-huh.

1019
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:34,880
Yeah.

1020
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,400
Did you get it?

1021
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,180
Uh-huh.

1022
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,340
Did I explain...

1023
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,100
I thought I was a good teacher!

1024
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,460
I thought I explained pretty well!

1025
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,520
You are a good teacher!

1026
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,880
You are!

1027
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,380
Is it the language barrier, though?

1028
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,580
Even though I improved my English this much, I can even transfer the right message to someone that I really need!

1029
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,680
Holy shit!

1030
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,500
Holy shit!

1031
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,540
Okay, drink water, yeah?

1032
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,780
Okay.

1033
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,300
Yay, water time!

1034
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,460
You are, Yusuke.

1035
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,280
Thank you!

1036
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,420
You are the best, man.

1037
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,620
Yay!

1038
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:27,760
Okay.

1039
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,060
So far, how do you feel?

1040
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,060
I feel great.

1041
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,720
I think I can be like...

1042
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,680
I think I'm like...

1043
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,120
really talented.

1044
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,760
I think I'm like a natural.

1045
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,960
Ooh, you gotta be scared, Yusuke.

1046
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,480
I'm gonna overtake you soon, in like two days.

1047
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,880
Oh my god.

1048
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,300
Someone destroy her, please.

1049
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,780
Someone do that for me.

1050
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,960
I thought you said...

1051
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,600
I thought you said I have positive reinforcement.

1052
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,420
I thought I was supposed to have positive reinforcement.

1053
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,440
Okay, so...

1054
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,620
You say that, you wanna take over my singing skill.

1055
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,620
My strength was the...

1056
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,900
Aren't... would you be happy?

1057
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,280
Cause I meant you like taught me to be better than you.

1058
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,680
Wouldn't you be proud of that?

1059
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,800
Just try to...

1060
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,280
That the student overtakes the...

1061
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,600
the teacher?

1062
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,000
That's like a classic...

1063
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,600
Try me.

1064
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,360
Try me.

1065
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,340
Not now.

1066
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,640
I'm still a student.

1067
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,340
I'm still a student.

1068
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,480
And maybe in two days.

1069
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,420
Maybe next week on your concert.

1070
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,400
That's like...

1071
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,500
That's the best step on your own concert.

1072
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,120
Okay.

1073
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,120
Okay.

1074
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:45,880
Okay.

1075
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,540
How about...

1076
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,380
Okay, you can prove me that...

1077
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,240
by...

1078
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,380
in the next lesson.

1079
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,120
Okay, it's the next lesson.

1080
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,260
That's the vocal expansion.

1081
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,560
Vocal expansion?

1082
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,260
Okay.

1083
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:57,880
Yeah.

1084
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,140
Uh...

1085
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,640
Okay, I'm just gonna...

1086
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,040
My strength!

1087
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,540
That I think!

1088
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,040
Yeah?

1089
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,600
Okay.

1090
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,600
In my opinion, my strength is the vocal range.

1091
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,080
Okay.

1092
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,620
So that's gonna be my strength too, right?

1093
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,400
Yeah, I mean try that.

1094
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,380
Try that.

1095
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,080
Okay.

1096
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,020
I'm just gonna show you how I do that.

1097
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,260
Okay?

1098
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,260
Okay.

1099
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,600
That's the piano sound you hear.

1100
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,020
Okay?

1101
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,400
Yeah.

1102
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,600
It's a little bit risky to use the voice.

1103
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:48,880
So...

1104
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,400
Vibro!

1105
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,140
Vibro!

1106
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:03,370
Switch!

1107
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:08,900
And...

1108
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,380
Do it as long as possible.

1109
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:12,540
Whoa.

1110
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,240
Okay.

1111
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:14,760
Easy.

1112
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,460
Yeah?

1113
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,180
Easy, right?

1114
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,600
Easy.

1115
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah.

1116
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,900
So, you make it look so easy.

1117
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,000
Of course, because it's easy for me.

1118
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,360
So that means it's gonna be easy for me too!

1119
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:29,660
Yeah!

1120
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,660
Yeah, let's see.

1121
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,620
Okay, I got this.

1122
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:32,740
Yeah.

1123
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,500
And don't stop that, okay?

1124
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,380
Okay.

1125
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:36,820
Okay.

1126
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:36,980
Okay.

1127
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,120
Okay, let's just...

1128
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,840
Let's keep going as much as possible.

1129
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,000
No, vibro!

1130
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:42,280
Vibro!

1131
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,120
Vibro!

1132
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:44,740
Vibro!

1133
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,280
Ok.

1134
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,060
So let's try again.

1135
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:51,260
Okay.

1136
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,620
So we start in the Vibro.

1137
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:57,980
Vibro.

1138
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:58,300
Vibro.

1139
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:58,660
Vibro.

1140
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:11,740
Switch!

1141
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,100
Good, good, good, good.

1142
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,800
Yeah, you forgot to switch that.

1143
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,640
Don't stop that!

1144
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,440
Keep going.

1145
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,480
Higher, higher.

1146
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,480
Higher, higher.

1147
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,990
I'm not gonna stop her, I'm not gonna stop her.

1148
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,090
I'm not gonna stop!

1149
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,940
I can do this everything.

1150
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,680
I can do this everything.

1151
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,270
Are you tired?

1152
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,150
No!

1153
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:05,970
Are you tired?

1154
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,730
You're tired?

1155
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,920
No, I'm not stopping her.

1156
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,150
Okay.

1157
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:57,030
Good one, guys.

1158
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,070
Good one,

1159
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:03,890
guys.

1160
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:04,990
Good one,

1161
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:49,210
guys.

1162
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:50,790
Ah...

1163
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,970
Did you finish it?

1164
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,890
I think you can stop that already.

1165
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:24,970
I start feeling sorry cause, you know, I kinda feel like I'm publicly blamed.

1166
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:25,910
I mean, like...

1167
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,790
You know, yeah.

1168
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,750
I don't want to be cancelled anymore.

1169
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:32,750
I just want to...

1170
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,330
I gotta defend myself now.

1171
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:36,190
Come on.

1172
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,190
Okay.

1173
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,050
That's the vocal expansion.

1174
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:44,750
Yeah?

1175
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:45,750
Oh my god.

1176
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,150
You didn't even do all the high notes!

1177
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,990
I can do it!

1178
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,510
I'm doing almost everything.

1179
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:52,230
Do it!

1180
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,750
Try doing it right now.

1181
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,250
Higher!

1182
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,190
Oh shit.

1183
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,410
That's high.

1184
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:11,370
No.

1185
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,630
It's not that high.

1186
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,010
I can hit higher notes.

1187
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:14,830
It's just...

1188
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,070
I'm just a bit tired.

1189
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,850
Oh, you're tired.

1190
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,350
Okay, you are tired.

1191
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,290
You have concert prep.

1192
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:22,710
Yeah.

1193
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,290
Well anyway, that was the basic practice.

1194
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:32,310
Then I bet this is pretty easy for everyone to follow.

1195
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,930
You can really underestimate this.

1196
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:36,770
Yeah.

1197
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:36,950
You can really underestimate this.

1198
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,090
Yeah.

1199
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,590
This one gives you a breath control thing.

1200
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:45,670
You will notice that.

1201
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:50,410
You will get enough stamina to sing the entire song.

1202
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:56,690
Because some people, they can't finish singing just one single song because it makes them so tired.

1203
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:01,130
So for those people, I really want all of them to consider doing the lip rolls.

1204
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,590
Because it really helps.

1205
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:02,950
Yeah.

1206
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,570
I'm already tired.

1207
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,190
I mean, yeah.

1208
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,590
Vocal training is something you shouldn't really do more than an hour.

1209
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:21,170
You know, if you do vocal training like 40 minutes, maybe like three times a week, that should be good enough.

1210
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:22,990
Oh, three times a week.

1211
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,170
I thought you said three times a day.

1212
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:24,410
Okay.

1213
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:25,910
No, don't do that.

1214
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:26,890
Three times a week.

1215
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,710
You don't want to destroy your throat.

1216
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,830
Yeah, I don't.

1217
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,810
Vocal code is pretty sensitive.

1218
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:32,670
Yeah.

1219
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:38,570
So it's the reason why I don't recommend the streamers to, you know, stream every day.

1220
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:39,670
Because...

1221
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,050
I streamed every day this week.

1222
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,630
But I did it.

1223
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,110
But I did it.

1224
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:47,830
How many hours?

1225
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:49,450
I don't know.

1226
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,390
It'd be two to three hours.

1227
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:55,750
It's not really...

1228
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,030
Two to three hours should be fine.

1229
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:57,510
Yeah.

1230
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,710
But let's say if you're streaming more than five hours, that's pretty concerning.

1231
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,390
I don't recommend doing that.

1232
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,070
Yeah, that's not good, guys.

1233
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,230
Remember to rest your vocal cords.

1234
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,270
Yeah.

1235
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,950
Your vocal cord is really sensitive.

1236
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,430
You don't want to get surgery on your vocal cords.

1237
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,250
Yeah.

1238
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,390
It's like a paper, guys.

1239
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:20,510
Then if it's poured out or something, it wouldn't be back.

1240
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:21,790
It wouldn't be the same anymore.

1241
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:23,310
So be really careful.

1242
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:26,490
That's why I don't sing every day.

1243
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,390
Because I care about my vocal cords.

1244
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,810
And you can't beat me on that.

1245
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:30,670
You can't beat me on the stage anymore.

1246
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:31,350
Okay.

1247
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:32,570
You accepted that.

1248
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,190
No.

1249
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,990
I could still...

1250
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,030
I still have a week and two days.

1251
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,910
I still have a week and two days.

1252
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,810
Guys, did you guys know?

1253
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,050
I'm grown!

1254
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,070
That's a big picture!

1255
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,050
You said you're trying to...

1256
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:55,470
Guys!

1257
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,150
That's the...

1258
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,990
Why?

1259
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:58,710
That's my concert!

1260
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,710
There's no image of me!

1261
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:01,710
Guys!

1262
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,530
Look!

1263
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,470
I'm gonna have a concert!

1264
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,450
That's my concert!

1265
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:07,830
That's my concert!

1266
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:15,910
Guys, you can go see me at Trails of...

1267
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,430
Trails of Flame.

1268
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,370
Guys, I'm gonna be in Hong...

1269
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:28,110
Guys, I'm gonna be in Hong Kong!

1270
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:32,170
I can't believe the concert organizer they actually made this poster.

1271
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,590
And there's no image of me at all!

1272
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:35,730
No image!

1273
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,410
Not even my name is there!

1274
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,050
Oh my god!

1275
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,070
With my special guest who you saw.

1276
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,390
Okay.

1277
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:50,510
Here's that.

1278
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,470
Here's the actual concert.

1279
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,050
There you go.

1280
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,490
So anyway, I'll put it on the side.

1281
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:01,530
Okay.

1282
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,250
Yusa, why don't you talk about your concert?

1283
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:05,550
Oh.

1284
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:06,850
Um...

1285
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,210
Check my music video.

1286
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,730
That's not a...

1287
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,030
That's not a concert!

1288
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,090
Okay, so...

1289
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,770
So why is it one man live?

1290
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:19,970
What about me?

1291
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,890
That should be a two man live.

1292
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:23,450
I'm gonna go to the concert.

1293
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:24,470
I'm promoting myself!

1294
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:26,770
I deserve this shit!

1295
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,690
I deserve promoting myself!

1296
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,750
Okay.

1297
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,590
Okay, everyone.

1298
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,370
Hello.

1299
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,870
The Trail of Flame.

1300
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:38,490
It's my first mini world tour.

1301
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,310
So I'm gonna be... the first stop is gonna be Hong Kong.

1302
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,930
And then Taipei.

1303
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,710
And after that, the last stop is gonna be Tokyo.

1304
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:50,850
And it's a full band, live performance with my band member.

1305
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:55,950
And it's my official return on stage because...

1306
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:05,830
Another reason why I became VTuber is that I started having performance anxiety and I was not able to sing in front of people.

1307
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:10,110
But this time, I am officially returning on the stage.

1308
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:10,590
Yeah!

1309
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:13,410
So if you guys gonna be there, that means a lot.

1310
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:14,410
And there's gonna be...

1311
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,410
Excuse me!

1312

1320
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:35,530
Why?

1321
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:37,910
Well...

1322
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,690
There's no only singing.

1323
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,470
There's gonna be like a lot of, you know, surprises.

1324
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,970

1325
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:55,270

1342
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:28,030
You guys are gonna be so excited about the songs...

1343
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:32,330

1344
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:39,830
Sure!

1345
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:40,890
Sure!

1346
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,730
That's why Yusong's teaching me how to sing!

1347
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:44,890
That's why!

1348
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:48,450
Do you wanna finish off last one?

1349
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,570
Just like last one?

1350
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,570
Last one?

1351
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,030
Before we're gonna be wrapping up?

1352
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,610
What do you mean by last one?

1353
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:55,890
Uh... Do you remember?

1354
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,270
I sent you the instrumental.

1355
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,490
Then I want you to do the rip roll.

1356
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:01,290
Oh!

1357
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:02,750
With the entire instrumental.

1358
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,110
What is this?

1359
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:08,510
I think I sent you the first message of today.

1360
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:08,830
Oh!

1361
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:09,110
I think.

1362
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,170
Do you wanna do that?

1363
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:11,510
Yeah!

1364
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,830
Yeah!

1365
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:12,050
Yeah!

1366
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:12,450

1367
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,250
I can!

1368
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,290
Okay.

1369
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:16,330
I can do it!

1370
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:18,330
Guys, watch this!

1371
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,330
It's gonna be so cool!

1372
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,750
It's gonna be so cool!

1373
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:22,530
Yeah!

1374
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:24,930
Oh shit!

1375
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:26,150
That's so...

1376
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,590
I'm sorry.

1377
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,050
That was really loud.

1378
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,430
You're never gonna be a musician.

1379
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,230
You're never gonna be a musician.

1380
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,130
Oh hey!

1381
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:53,630
Hey!

1382
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,010

1383
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:02,510

Go!

1385
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:10,590

1386
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:17,800
Doraeum!

1387
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,000
Doraeum!

1388
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,440

01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:35,720
Oh!

1391
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:44,960
Oh!

1392
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:45,480

01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,000
Doraeum!

1400
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,900
Is that how you call it?

1401
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:15,740
Yeah!

1402
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,360

1403
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,480

1406
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,410
Ding Dong!

1407
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,650
You want my talents now?

1408
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:38,770
You want my talents now?

1409
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,170
Ding Dong!

1410
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,490
That's how you call driver!

1411
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,250
Ça va

1412
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:51,670

1413
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,290
Ding Dong!

1414
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:54,550
Ding Dong!

1415
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:55,110
Ding Dong!

1416
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,950
Doraemon!

1417
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:25,210
Oh!

1418
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,330
Okay, you know that song, right?

1419
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,450
Oh, you know that song, right?

1420
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:34,450
I bet everyone knows that song.

1421
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,890
You guys know what I'm talking about, right?

1422
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,070
Ooh, you touch my talala.

1423
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:41,550
No!

1424
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,070
Ooh, you are ding-ding-dong.

1425
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,350
It's what we call Doraemon!

1426
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,270
That's what we call, we call him ding-dong.

1427
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,070
We used to call him that.

1428
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,410
What was the ding-dong stomp for?

1429
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,650
Is it like a sound of the bell?

1430
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,530
It's like, you know the bell?

1431
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:02,370
Yeah, it's a bell.

1432
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:03,570
It's like...

1433
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,930
Oh, don't say that about him!

1434
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:07,970
Bell!

1435
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,650
Yeah, you know the bell he has on his collar?

1436
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,570
So it goes ding-dong.

1437
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:12,870
The bell?

1438
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:13,390
Yeah.

1439
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:14,790
So that's what we call him.

1440
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:15,330
Bell, bell, .

1441
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:16,130
No!

1442
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:21,010
No!

1443
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:22,510
Okay.

1444
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,530
I'm done with the ding-dong joke.

1445
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:27,970
Okay.

1446
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:28,570
Okay.

1447
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:29,150
Okay.

1448
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:30,690
Seriously, good job.

1449
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:34,630
You have done like a, you know, 16 minutes vocal training?

1450
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:35,210
Yeah.

1451
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,230
Which is quite a lot.

1452
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:37,170
Is that a lot?

1453
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,250
That's actually a lot.

1454
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,770
Yeah, actually, we do around like 40 minutes training.

1455
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:44,990
That's the normal one.

1456
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:45,390
Oh!

1457
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:45,830
Yeah.

1458
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:46,350
Wait.

1459
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,410
I mean, it depends on people though.

1460
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,670
You should sing it.

1461
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:49,130
Wait, how?

1462
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,790
You should sing Doraemon.

1463
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:53,890
What does it sound like when you sing Doraemon?

1464
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,030
You want me to sing Acapela?

1465
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1466
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:02,570

Wait, what's a Disney song that you know?

01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:06,870
Do you know any Disney songs?

1484
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:08,830
A lot of Disney songs.

01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:38,970
No problem.

1500
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:40,710
Singing lessons.

1501
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,850
I learned so much today.

1502
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:44,570
What?

1503
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,450
I did!

1504
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,290
I did learn a lot!

1505
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,310
Yeah, at least.

1506
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:52,790
At least.

1507
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,110
I tried my best, guys.

1508
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:56,970
I'm totally gonna do this lesson again.

1509
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,410
For sure.

1510
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,390
Sure.

1511
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:05,270
Sure.

1512
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:06,850
Do that.

1513
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,170
Sure, do that.

1514
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:08,990
Yeah.

1515
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:12,750
Thank you again, Yusan, for the singing lessons.

1516
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,530
I had a great time.

1517
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,290
So yeah, check out the concert!

1518
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:17,710

Four.

1523
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,150
Yes, I know that.

1524
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,390
Did you say four?

1525
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,290
In August four!

1526
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:34,610

01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:36,810
So I'm really, really excited.

01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:41,430
And today you have something at ACGHK, right?

1529
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:42,210
Oh yeah.

1530
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:45,390
I'm gonna be showing up on the ACGHK main panel.

1531
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,030

01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:49,090
So if you guys are interested.

Any one of you there in Hong Kong, we'll meet there.

1535
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:54,950

1536
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:55,930

1541
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:01,790
Lai?

1542
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:02,250
Lai?

1543
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:02,670
Lai?

1544
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:03,370
Lai?

1545
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:03,890
Lai?

1546
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:04,590
Lai?

1547
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:05,410
Lai?

1548
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,250
Lai-lai-lai-lai.

1549
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:07,890
Lai-lai-lai-lai.

1550
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:11,210
I have a free check-in there for all of you guys.

1551
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,070
It's a present.

1552
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,730
So, yeah, it's a free stage.

1553
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,250
I'm gonna be at ACGHK too!

1554
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:19,070
But tomorrow, today, I'm gonna be at...

1555
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:19,330
Wow, Christmas!

1556
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:20,150
Yeah!

1557
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:24,670
Wow, it's assuming plan, this, to stay together at the end.

1558
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:25,890
...oh my god, wow.

1559
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:29,110
But I'll be at ACGHK as well!

1560
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:30,290
Right?

1561
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:30,730
Let's go.

1562
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:33,390
I also have merch there, too!

1563
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:45,290
The card is insane actually.

1564
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,890
I don't think we're doing this this time.

1565
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,970
But I'm accepting that at the concert venue guys.

1566
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:11,870
Yeah, I'm accepting gifts and letters at ACGHK.

1567
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,510
But you have to put it at the booth F36.

1568
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,290
But I'll also be in Singapore today!

1569
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,490
Well, Yusa is in Hong Kong.

1570
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:20,730
I'll be at Singapore.

1571
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,130
How many conventions did you show up already?

1572
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:25,070
Oh, it's a lot.

1573
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:28,950
It's like a whole convention.

1574
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:33,050
It's a world tour.

1575
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,370
Yeah, it's a world tour.

1576
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,830
Every month I think I have a convention.

1577
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:39,010
Because I want to meet all my fans!

1578
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:41,790
I want to meet all my dragoons around the world!

1579
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,590
Actually, that's ambitious.

1580
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,690
But please do take care of yourself.

1581
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:46,650
I'm trying.

1582
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,230
I'm trying my best.

1583
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:56,490
But yes, I'll be at Anime Festival Asia in Singapore today!

1584
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:59,650
I think my panel is in three hours.

1585
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:08,230
So if you're watching this on your phone right now or on your PC waiting for my... I'll be there in three hours, guys!

1586
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,470
I think I should have... yeah, I have like merch there too.

1587
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,170
I have like a t-shirt or something at Anime Festival Asia.

1588
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:22,330
If you guys want to get it, let me grab the PNG.

1589
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,490
I didn't save it because I'm not a professional.

1590
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:25,330
Yeah!

1591
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:26,970
Yeah!

1592
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:30,030
So yeah!

1593
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:32,710
I have stuff there too!

1594
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,850
I'm tired, Yusa.

1595
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,170
Come on!

1596
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,730
It's in three hours!

1597
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:42,750
Come on!

1598
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:43,830
It's in three hours.

1599
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,830
Oh my god.

1600
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,270
Are you gonna be singing in there?

1601
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,510
Oh yes!

1602
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:53,530
I'll be singing one song.

1603
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:55,290
Disney?

1604
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:56,690
I don't know.

1605
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,230
It's gonna be a surprise.

1606
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,790
Disney.

1607
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,530
I'm not gonna sing Disney just because you're out of spite.

1608
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:07,530
Out of spite, I won't sing Disney.

1609
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:13,630
I mean, Doraemon is at least something which is not Disney or Ghibli.

1610
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:14,630
I'm kind of proud of that.

1611
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:14,830
Yeah, see?

1612
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:19,910
I sang like one Ghibli song and then everybody...

1613
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:26,510
Guys, I actually forced Doki to sing PokéDance, okay?

1614
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,950
You gotta appreciate me for that.

1615
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:36,190
Hey boogie woogie boa- It's like such an easy song and I already forgot the lyrics.

1616
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:38,330
I already forgot.

1617
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,570
You know the first time when I sent you the video link?

1618
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:40,850
Yeah.

1619
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,650
You say, like, oh, I can't sing this one.

1620
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:43,390
It's in English.

1621
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:45,650
I thought it was in Japanese for some reason.

1622
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:46,730
I don't know.

1623
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,730
I just thought it was in Japanese!

1624
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:53,470
It's a cute, cute Japanese sounding English.

1625
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:56,970
Hey boogie woogie bom-bom let's go body-waddy boom-boom.

1626
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,390
I knew that this song was going to fit you pretty well.

1627
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,610
See, I remember this song.

1628
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:08,890
Yeah, I'm proud of you!

1629
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,050
I don't remember those lyrics, so I remember the first verse.

1630
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,610
Yeah, well, you sing one line.

1631
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,530
I sang three lines.

1632
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,550
Crap, crap, crap.

1633
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:30,830
You forgot the lyrics too!

1634
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:33,470
I do remember that!

1635
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:33,970
You forgot the lyrics!

1636
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:34,930
I do!

1637
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,750
I memorize everything!

1638
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:39,050
You literally was like...

1639
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,170
Crap, crap, crap.

1640
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,490
You already forgot the lyrics!

1641
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:43,790
It's actually clap, clap, clap.

1642
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:46,950
Be my buddy, clap, clap, clap.

1643
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:48,250
Yeah.

1644
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:50,090
Be my buddy.

1645
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:52,030
Get up and dance.

1646
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,630
And then what?

1647
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:56,130
Choose it to the body.

1648
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:58,070
And then move your, move your body.

1649
01:14:59,070 --> 01:14:59,790
Let's enjoy.

1650
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,450
And get closer day by day.

1651
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:05,170
Yeah!

1652
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,650
Do you still want to challenge me?

1653
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,050
Do you still want to challenge me?

1654
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,690
Okay, sing the Pokemon song.

1655
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:12,630
From memory.

1656
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:15,870
What is this?

1657
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:19,490
Am I allowed to sing in the Japanese version?

1658
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,070
No, English.

1659
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:22,930
I didn't know that!

1660
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:23,990
I didn't grow up...

1661
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:26,030
Yeah, but you said you remember everything!

1662
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:28,730
You said you remember every song you sang!

1663
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:33,170
I can only sing the Japanese one, not the English one.

1664
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,450
I can sing Digimon song though.

1665
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:35,650
That's Butterfly.

1666
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,190
Yeah, that's Butterfly.

1667
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:38,630
I can sing everything.

1668
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,050
I can even memorize everything.

1669
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:40,970
Wait, no, you sang it during Anime Expo!

1670
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,490
That's cheating!

1671
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,850
It's still fresh in your mind!

1672
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,310
You're like froze.

1673
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:48,870
Are you serious?

1674
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:49,650
Oh, there you are.

1675
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:52,290
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1676
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:54,410
Sing...

1677
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,010
Okay, I'm thinking.

1678
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:58,710
Sing what's the song that I know.

1679
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,550
I think I can just sing everything.

1680
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:04,790
I think I can just sing everything.

1681
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:05,270
Except for Pokemon!

1682
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,170
Except for the English Pokemon song.

1683
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:08,010
You can't sing that.

1684
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,870
Oh, Biggest Dreamer!

1685
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:10,230
Nice!

1686
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,130
That's a good idea.

1687
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,210
I love Biggest Dreamer.

1688
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:13,970
Teemers.

1689
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,090
Digimon Teemers.

1690
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:16,690
That's one of the best Digimon.

1691
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,370
Is it that one?

1692
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,730
Yeah, that one.

1693
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,350
Sing Toxic.

1694
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,950
Biggest dreamer.

1695
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:25,610
Sing Toxic.

1696
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,440
Toxic.

1697
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,020
You don't even know Toxic!

1698
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:35,740
Toxic.

1699
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,700
You don't even know the lyrics of Toxic.

1700
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:41,000
You stupid, you fucking bitch.

1701
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,460
You don't even know the lyrics for Toxic.

1702
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,800
You're toxic, you fucking bitch.

1703
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,040
I know it's a Britney Spears.

1704
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,420
Yeah, but you don't even know the lyrics.

1705
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:56,980
So technically you don't know every song lyric you've ever listened to.

1706
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,220
You don't know everything.

1707
01:16:58,740 --> 01:16:58,880
You bitch.

1708
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,040
You bitch.

1709
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,780
There's no you bitch.

1710
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,700
There's no you bitch.

1711
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,280
There's no you bitch in Toxic.

1712
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,720
Where are you getting that from?

1713
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,120
You bitch.

1714
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,820
That's all I know.

1715
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,780
Where the fuck did you get the bitch from?

1716
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:16,640
You...

1717
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,300
You bitch.

1718
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:22,900
You bitch.

1719
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,460
Am I correct or wrong?

1720
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,880
No, there's no bitch in there!

1721
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,700
You're toxic.

1722
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,380
I'm slipping under.

1723
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,100
That's the lyrics.

1724
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:41,180
Where did you get bitch from?

1725
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:43,880
But yeah.

1726
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:46,620
I remember it was something you wrote.

1727
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:46,860
Right?

1728
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,440
Then...

1729
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,640
Yeah.

1730
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,640
What?

1731
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,560
That's fucked up.

1732
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,080
We don't count that.

1733
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,680
This is not positive reinforcement.

1734
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,540
This is...

1735
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:08,700
Now I'll never get better at singing because my teacher isn't positive.

1736
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,260
My teacher called me a bitch.

1737
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,320
Now I'll quit singing forever.

1738
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:18,480
Student.

1739
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,380
Student.

1740
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,580
Student.

1741
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,320
Yeah, that's me.

1742
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,400
Don't mix up...

1743
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,880
Don't mix up lyrics and also...

1744
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,260
my word.

1745
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,580
Don't mix up your private and also the lyrics.

1746
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,100
It's not.

1747
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:41,320
Even though I call you bitch, you're not gonna make you bitch.

1748
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,240
But... but bitch was...

1749
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:43,240
I mean...

1750
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,740
It wasn't even in the lyrics.

1751
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,160
That's not the real lyrics though.

1752
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,680
Or do you want to be a bitch?

1753
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:52,080
No.

1754
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:53,660
I'll cry.

1755
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,780
Yeah, you don't wanna be a bitch, right?

1756
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:56,200
I'll cry.

1757
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,620
No.

1758
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:57,920
Cause that's what you are.

1759
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,700
Then just don't take my words seriously.

1760
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,320
I'm just saying bitch.

1761
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,540
But even though I called you bitch, you're not gonna make you bitch.

1762
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,040
Yeah?

1763
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1764
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,200
Right?

1765
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:10,900
Yeah.

1766
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:12,680
Right?

1767
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,980
What the fuck is this conversation?

1768
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,560
They don't...

1769
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,820
They didn't know.

1770
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,600
They didn't know what I just told them.

1771
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,020
Yay!

1772
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,060
Oh, okay.

1773
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,300
I'll pretend.

1774
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:34,800
Okay.

1775
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:35,340
Whatever.

1776
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,280
Whatever is there.

1777
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,100
Even...

1778
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,000
Yay!

1779
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:41,580
Yay!

1780
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,760
Anyway, that was a great lesson.

1781
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:44,760
Have you been...

1782
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,580
Oh my gosh.

1783
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,040
You've been practicing, right?

1784
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:47,840
For your concert?

1785
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,000
Yeah.

1786
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,760
I just practiced yesterday.

1787
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:56,800
Okay, so thing is that now I'm in Thailand.

1788
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,560
Because I need to practice with my band member.

1789
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,140
And...

1790
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,040
Actually yesterday...

1791
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,720
Technically 10 hours ago because I haven't slept yet.

1792
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,320
Whoa!

1793
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,520
We...

1794
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:14,880
That was like, you know, we only practiced through online but it was our first practice on offline.

1795
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:17,880
On like live together type deal, right?

1796
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:18,900
Yeah, on live together.

1797
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,960
And I was pretty satisfied with this.

1798
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,400
Hello?

1799
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,450
Keep holding!

1800
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,330
Keep holding the line!

1801
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:32,490
Let me know when we're back!

1802
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:34,950
I was gonna...

1803
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,190
I was gonna...

1804
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:38,630
I was... The chat!

1805
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:38,650
The chat!

1806
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:39,370
Oh, we're back!

1807
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,730
We're back!

1808
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:40,090
We're back!

1809
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:41,470
Anyway, sorry.

1810
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,610
You saw I was gonna be super emotional and then I blue screen.

1811
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:51,120
They're gonna let their heart out and then I blue screen.

1812
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,260
I was... I was speaking...

1813
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,660
I was just speaking all by my own.

1814
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,560
Just being emotional.

1815
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,540
No one's listening.

1816
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,140
Not even Dokis listening.

1817
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,300
I was speaking just all by my own.

1818
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,120
I'm in.

1819
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,500
They're like, what were you satisfied with?

1820
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,800
You ended on a cliffhanger.

1821
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,500
You saw.

1822
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,500
What were you satisfied with?

1823
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:14,560
It would be so funny if I blue screen again right where you said it.

1824
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:19,860
I was super emotional!

1825
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,220
Don't you know I'm in?

1826
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:27,770
Oh my god.

1827
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:32,110
What were you satisfied with?

1828
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:33,030
You saw.

1829
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,050
What was it?

1830
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,370
I don't wanna talk about it again.

1831
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:38,530
Oh, we'll never know.

1832
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,330
I'm still... We'll never know.

1833
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:41,010
It's one of my...

1834
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:43,530
one of the greatest secrets out there.

1835
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,290
Yeah, fuck that.

1836
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:45,950
Fuck that.

1837
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:47,130
You know, I don't need...

1838
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:49,110
I don't have to be understood by others.

1839
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:49,490
No!

1840
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:50,550
No, Tess!

1841
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:52,530
This secret just belongs to me.

1842
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:52,730
I'm sorry!

1843
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:53,650
Don't touch it!

1844
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:54,130
No!

1845
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:55,030
Don't hurt me!

1846
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:55,650
You saw, Tess!

1847
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,930
Don't hurt me again!

1848
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,850
Please, you wanna know!

1849
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,570
I don't fucking care.

1850
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:02,150
What about the band?

1851
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:06,630
You were so emotional because you were playing with your band for the first time.

1852
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:07,070
Yeah!

1853
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:08,150
For the concert.

1854
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:08,990
My member...

1855
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:12,510
My band member finally having me back on stage!

1856
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:19,630
We have been fighting for this fucking two years and we're finally able to see each other on stage!

1857
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:21,110
You know what I mean?

1858
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:22,050
Yeah!

1859
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,410
Yeah!

1860
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:22,730
Yeah!

1861
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:22,970
Yeah!

1862
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:23,230
Yeah!

1863
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:23,390
Yeah!

1864
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:26,890
The blue screen won't silence you!

1865
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:31,230
That was a so emotional story.

1866
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:31,970
Yeah!

1867
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,610
I was like...

1868
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:35,210
I was like, you know... That was so emotional, guys.

1869
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:41,030
Before I become VTuber, I made a really really big fight with my band members that we were not like...

1870
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:46,310
You know, we kind of stopped playing together and I had strong performance anxiety as well, you know?

1871
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:47,350
Yeah.

1872
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:50,550
Now, now, we're back on stage together!

1873
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:51,850
Yeah!

1874
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,810
World Tour!

1875
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,750
Yeah, guys!

1876
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:56,710
World Tour!

1877
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:57,750
Everybody!

1878
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:00,550
I was talking about this all alone.

1879
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:01,710
Yeah!

1880
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:03,510
World Tour!

1881
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:05,650
World Tour.

1882
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,130
It means a lot.

1883
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:10,530
So, you know, again, thank you for being my first guest, okay?

1884
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,270
Yeah!

1885
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:12,150
That's me!

1886
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:15,570
I'm gonna be there in Hong Kong August 4th, guys!

1887
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,110
The two of us live!

1888
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:19,530
Yeah!

1889
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:24,550
Mom and life!

1890
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,110
There's two of us!

1891
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,490
Mom and... Mom and...

1892
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:27,150
No.

1893
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:28,050
No.

1894
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:28,210
No.

1895
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,030
There's two of us!

1896
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,730
No.

1897
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:30,210
No.

1898
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,530
I know how to count!

1899
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:33,410
You son doesn't know how to count.

1900
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,770
No!

1901
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:35,030
You son doesn't know how to count.

1902
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:35,570
Yeah, okay.

1903
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,210
I fucked up.

1904
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,070
Okay, I don't... It's clearly one and two.

1905
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:38,530
I don't have to be good at the math.

1906
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:41,550
One plus one equals two, you son.

1907
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,990
Why do I have to be mathematic?

1908
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:45,590
Why am I actually a fucking musician?

1909
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:49,750
I don't care the numbers because I'm a musician.

1910
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,870
I'm living with my own sense.

1911
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:53,270
That's true.

1912
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:54,030
That's true.

1913
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:59,070
Yeah, so many people say like, whenever I say something, is there any scientific proof?

1914
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:01,210
A scientific statement or something?

1915
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:02,470
I don't have to do that.

1916
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:03,770
I don't owe doing that.

1917
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,150
I am not responsible for doing that because I'm just a musician!

1918
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,830
Exactly!

1919
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,750
Speak your truth, you son!

1920
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:09,530
Speak it!

1921
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:16,190
I'm super excited.

1922
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:21,230
I'm super excited to do this concert with you son.

1923
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:24,410
I'm really looking forward to the dragoons being there.

1924
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,530
And yeah!

1925
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,110
We're looking forward to it.

1926
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:32,410
Is there anything else you want to say before we call it for today?

1927
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,210

1928
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:39,190

As always everybody, say hi, pause, check out, and move around to get that blood flowing.

1936
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,810
And if you stayed up for us, head to bed!

1937
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:59,290
Because you deserve it!

1938
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,730
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

1939
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:02,170
Bye guys!

1940
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:03,050

1941

Bye bye!
