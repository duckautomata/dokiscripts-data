1
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,750
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,770
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,130
I'm sorry!

4
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,350
I'm so sorry I'm late!

5
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,790
Oh, my God!

6
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,750
I'm sorry, everybody.

7
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,670
So, yeah, I think we all know why I'm late.

8
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,690
So, I'm really sorry, guys.

9
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,910
I really... I needed... I needed more time.

10
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:18,630
I needed to, like, you know, re-situate myself and I just needed... I needed more time to process everything that fucking happened today.

11
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,670
So, I'm sorry.

12
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,590
I really appreciate everyone for being so patient with me.

13
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,890
And, like, I'm sorry.

14
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:36,770
I know I'm like... I know I'm like an hour... I'm really... I really appreciate Cookie Run for waiting it out for me.

15
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,650
I really, really appreciate... Thank you, Cookie Run!

16
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,510
And thank you, everybody, for, like, gassing me up and glazing me.

17
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,450
And thank you, guys.

18
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,290
Guys, we all love Cookie Run, right?

19
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,370
We all... Oh, man.

20
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,850
You guys already clicked the download link already, right?

21
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,150
Oh, you guys just saw me... You saw me.

22
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,890
You're like, oh, my gosh, JoeKeeper's gonna be playing Cookie Run?

23
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,230
That's enough of an endorsement for me.

24
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,290
I'm gonna even... I'm gonna download that game right now without watching a stream yet.

25
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,110
That's how much I believe in her.

26
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,890
Right, guys?

27
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,470
Right?

28
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,410
Right?

29
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,130
Oh, my God.

30
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:23,730
Anyway, so, if you guys didn't know, this is not our very... This is not our first time playing Cookie Run.

31
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,290
Cookie Run actually sponsored me a couple of months back.

32
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:35,190
And they loved the sponsored stream from last time, you know, when I started, like, beating up the children in-game.

33
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,830
In-game.

34
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,550
In-game.

35
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:49,730
When I started using the most overpowered characters, I saw those little babies, and I was like, that's right, I'm gonna teach you a lesson with my one character.

36
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,550
And they're like, we like that.

37
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,810
Let's get her again.

38
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,930
And I was like, oh, man, I don't even know if they're gonna get me back after I did that.

39
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,110
They're like, we like this stream.

40
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,970
Alright, we're gonna get her again.

41
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,930
Anyway, oh, yeah, I'll use Tails.

42
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,230
You guys were like, use Sonic!

43
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,710
And I was like, no, I'm gonna use Tails.

44
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,890
I'm gonna feed Tails everything I have.

45
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,170
That's not even my money.

46
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:31,030
I'm gonna use this guy's- all their money and just fucking- oh, sorry, just freaking- Oh my god, I'm sorry, I'm a mess right now.

47
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,230
I'm gonna feed him, I'm gonna buff Tails.

48
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,650
And they're gonna be like, oh my god, who beat me?

49
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,810
Who beat my team?

50
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,430
And then all they see is one cookie and it's Tails.

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,930
Not even an A-tier character, it's just Tails.

52
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,370
Hey guys, huge shoutout to Cookie Run for the sponsor.

53
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,890
I know everything was a little bit poor timing.

54
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,930
So I really appreciate your patience for waiting an hour for me to do this stream.

55
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,570
I really appreciate it, guys.

56
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,750
So for those who don't know, apparently it is Cookie Run's 4th year anniversary.

57
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:30,270
So there's a lot of new updates, there's a lot of new characters to pull, there's a lot of new things that happened in between the last Cookie Run sponsor to this Cookie Run sponsor.

58
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,450
So there's a lot of neat things to check out.

59
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:42,730
I'm always gonna be super in awe and surprised because, like I said, it's been a while since the last time I played Cookie Run was a couple of days after the sponsor.

60
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,890
And honestly, I really do enjoy it.

61
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:59,390
I think one of my favorite things about Cookie Run, Cookie Run Kingdom and their branding and the universe of Cookie Run is just the character designs are really pretty.

62
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:07,790
I have to admit, they have really nice character designs and yeah, I'm super looking forward to it.

63
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,630
I think when I logged in, I don't think there was cinematic, so let's watch the cinematic.

64
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,870
Also, I don't know if the sound guy is around right now.

65
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,870
So this is the new character.

66
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,810
I believe his name is Shadow Milk.

67
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,510
It's a bit loud, let me turn it down.

68
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,370
Oh,

69
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,750
I love the music.

70
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,430
Why wasn't I?

71
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,530
I wish I was a competitive Cookie Run player.

72
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,410
To bring... yeah, I want to do that app in the settings.

73
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,010
You're right, it's never too late.

74
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,490
You're right.

75
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,930
Can I keep this account?

76
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,970
You're right, can I keep this account?

77
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,530
We all need a head start.

78
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,650
This could be my head start.

79
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,410
Why can't Cookie Run have VTubers?

80
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,600
Honestly, if Cookie Run has like a VTuber...

81
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,150
Guys, they're nuking this account, right?

82
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,450
Okay, I was told they will nuke this account when the stream ends.

83
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,580
But they can't nuke it if the stream never ends.

84
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,990
My competitive arc starts now.

85
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,770
They can't do anything if I just never close end the stream.

86
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,210
That's right.

87
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,270
I'm still finding loopholes even though the loopholes end up fucking me over.

88
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,670
I'm still finding loopholes.

89
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,230
I never learn.

90
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,270
I never learn.

91
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,270
The Doki Bird Suppathon of only competitive Cookie Run starts now.

92
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,390
It's just Cookie Run.

93
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,270
Nothing else.

94
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,390
I just never stop the stream.

95
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,050
This account is mine now.

96
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,770
They can't.

97
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,350
They said they'll only nuke the account after the stream is over.

98
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,130
They can't do that if I just never end the stream.

99
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:03,850
That's illegal.

100
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,750
That's illegal.

101
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,690
Okay, so that's one of the Shadow Milk Cookie.

102
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,370
That's one of the new designs.

103
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,890
And there's also Candy Apple Cookie.

104
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,870
Oh my god, they're all so cute.

105
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,870
And then, oh, there's like the Muse Season.

106
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,730
Explore makes the game more fun.

107
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,130
Wait, oh yeah, there was a Halloween update too.

108
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,950
But yeah, there is a lot of new things.

109
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,470
Not new updates because it's the 4th year anniversary.

110
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,370
So I'm not surprised because it is the 4th year anniversary.

111
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,670
And usually during anniversary years, they tend to release a lot of cool stuff.

112
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,470
Yeah, I really like the design.

113
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,190
Choose areas that each beast is occupying to vanquish them and proceed with the story.

114
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:49,730
Okay.

115
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,370
Okay, I want to... let's see.

116
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,290
I want... okay, guys.

117
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,870
Because it's my account now.

118
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,730
Let me change the name.

119
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,330
It's my account now.

120
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,910
It's my kingdom now.

121
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,910
That's right.

122
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,310
What can you do now?

123
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,770
You can't delete this account.

124
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,390
It's mine now.

125
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:22,230
How could you delete the account if it's mine?

126
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,950
That's right.

127
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,110
What are you going to do now?

128
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,130
It's mine.

129
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,770
I yoink this kingdom.

130
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,980
I shall...

131
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,280
But it's not...

132
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, so they won't know.

133
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,700
They won't know it's me.

134
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,460
You're right.

135
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,280
I'm going to change the password.

136
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,360
No, it's not going to stop them from deleting the account.

137
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
That's right, guys.

138
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,160
How can they take...

139
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,540
How can they take the account if I usurped the account, guys?

140
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,620
How could they?

141
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Checkmate.

142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,480
Yeah, exactly.

143
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,920
They will assume I would name my account after me.

144
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,580
So they don't know that it's not Doki.

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
That's right.

146
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Oh, it's three steps ahead.

147
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,980
Look at my beautiful...

148
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, hey, look.

149
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,500
There's Donald.

150
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,180
Look at my beautiful kingdom that I worked so hard.

151
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,980
Look at that.

152
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,100
My beautiful kingdom...

153
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,520
that I worked so incredibly hard on.

154
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,160
This is where my competitive cookie run...

155
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,260
My competitive cookie run arc starts now.

156
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,500
It actually started...

157
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,320
You know, I've had this account for like a couple of years now.

158
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,180
So I'm really happy that I'm able to showcase this account that is totally mine.

159
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,140
Legitimately mine.

160
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,860
And I was very happy.

161
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,760
Yeah, I grinded...

162
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,060
I grinded all of this.

163
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,820
I know, I know.

164
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,100
I managed to grind all of this off stream.

165
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,520
And like I said, I legitimately own this account.

166
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,760
And because this is legitimately my account...

167
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,860
Obviously, I get to keep this after the stream.

168
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,960
Right, guys?

169
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,160
Oh my god, all this hard work.

170
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,780
Oh my god, 31,522 jellies guys.

171
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,620
That I totally earned myself.

172
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,200
You shouldn't have.

173
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,960
I was there for all of this.

174
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,740
Okay, where is the...

175
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,080
I know where the volume is, guys.

176
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,920
Gosh.

177
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,500
I played this game for so long.

178
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,020
Of course I know where it is.

179
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,100
Guys, of course I do.

180
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,480
Okay, now I just need to boost up the volume a little bit.

181
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,140
Alright, this is sponsored.

182
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,720
That's why I love Cookie Run so much.

183
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,120
Alright, so...

184
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,860
I believe there is...

185
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,380
Oh my god, I feel like there's so many more things now.

186
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,120
For the 4th year anniversary.

187
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,020
Let's see, what do they have?

188
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,300
Ooh, toppings.

189
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,280
I wanna know.

190
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,920
What login bonus do I get?

191
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,080
January 18th, searing raspberry.

192
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,760
Oh my god, that is a lot.

193
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,260
That is...

194
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Whoa, okay.

195
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
There's a lot of rewards.

196
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,060
There's the topping.

197
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,840
Oh, there it is.

198
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,640
What do I get?

199
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,760
Ooh, I'll get some jelly beans.

200
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,640
Ooh, I got new update gifts.

201
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,040
Ooh.

202
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,040
And then I get tickets to join the cookie...

203
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,080
Oh wait, I'll just claim it all.

204
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,960
I feel like...

205
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,220
Oh my god, there's a lot, okay.

206
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,360
Alright, there's...

207
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,520
Okay.

208
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,500
Make your choice, guys.

209
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,060
Which one?

210
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,080
Do I get the 30 pristine powder?

211
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,060
Or the...

212
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,360
Oh wait, they're all different stats.

213
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,040
You know what?

214
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,660
Attack is the best defense.

215
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,100
There you go.

216
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,200
Pristine charge power.

217
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,860
Yeah, let's get it four times.

218
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,020
That's right.

219
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,360
Nice.

220
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,100
Like I always say...

221
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,460
Attack is the best defense.

222
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,920
Let's go, I love free stuff.

223
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,160
I worked so hard for these three things.

224
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,240
Like...

225
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,820
Oh my god.

226
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,420
I can see how people can get very addicted.

227
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,020
Since I'm one of them.

228
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,580
I mean, it took me a long time to...

229
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,700
Grind my way up here on my not-doki account.

230
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,140
Sound, guys.

231
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,940
All the sound.

232
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,500
Lots of hard work.

233
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,140
Yeah, there's lots of bonus items and everything.

234
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,660
Because like I said, it is the fourth year anniversary.

235
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,280
So...

236
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,120
There is a lot of like bonus items that comes with logging in today.

237
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,760
And like the next couple of days for the fourth year anniversary.

238
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,260
So honestly, it is like the best time to start playing Cookie Run.

239
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,240
Because we all like free stuff.

240
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,080
As always.

241
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,780
I mean, not me.

242
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,340
I like hard work and...

243
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,600
Sorry.

244
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,240
I also love free stuff.

245
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,060
But you know what I like even more?

246
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,640
As you see from my town.

247
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,400
Hard work and determination to build up a town like this.

248
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,860
But of course, building up a beautiful town like mine...

249
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,780
Takes a couple of months of hard grinding.

250
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,380
So you gotta keep playing.

251
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,140
But you also gotta thank me too.

252
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,780
And be like...

253
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,220
Wow, thank you Doki Bird for introducing me to Cookie Run Kingdom.

254
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,740
And letting me have a town that's just as beautiful as yours.

255
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,240
Not Doki account.

256
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,720
But yes, there are some coupons that will be coming out on multiple social media channels.

257
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,180

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,460
Alright.

260
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,960
Let's do our favorite thing.

261
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,500
Okay.

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,200
4th year anniversary lot.

263
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,520
Woah.

264
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,960
There's a lot of things in the shop.

265
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,640
The update package $3.99.

266
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,820
Oh my god, is it...

267
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,300
Shit.

268
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm rich.

269
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,080
Of course I'm rich.

270
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,780
I grinded for this for so long.

271
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,120
You can let other players hire your cookies?

272
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,560
Isn't that awesome?

273
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,100
Oh my god, I can have other people pay me?

274
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,980
Oh my god.

275
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,420
Alright.

276
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,580
Alright.

277
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,020
Alright, hire...

278
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,900
Hire... get weekly rewards if your cookie gets hired a lot.

279
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,540
You can... wait.

280
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,540
Who are the most demanded cookies?

281
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,480
I hope I'll earn my place on that list one day.

282
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,100
See this button?

283
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,140
You pick the cookie.

284
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,160
You can tap it.

285
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,740
There's a reward for registering your cookie for...

286
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
Don't forget to claim it.

287
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,520
Guys, who is the most in demand cookie out there?

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,940
Oh my god, it has to be Tails, right?

289
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,920
Guys.

290
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,960
Guys, hire my Tails cookie.

291
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,100
He's been through so much.

292
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,560
Alright, I'm gonna claim.

293
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,160
Alright, surely...

294
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,820
Surely, Tails is the most requested.

295
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,460
I made him look so broken.

296
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,860
Surely, he has to be the...

297
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,500
There's no way he isn't.

298
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,380
I'm pretty sure.

299
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,740
Alright.

300
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:19,940
Alright.

301
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,660
Surely, he has to be the most requested cookie out there.

302
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,640
No gear.

303
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,520
He doesn't need gear.

304
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,360
He's so good already.

305
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,620
I already made him look so broken.

306
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,720
Alright.

307
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,020
It's time to do our favorite...

308
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,260
Oh, did I do it?

309
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,320
Wait.

310
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,840
That's it?

311
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,530
Oh no, this is the new one!

312
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,030
I was like, oh my god, did I do it?

313
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,730
That was so...

314
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,590
Alright, let's see.

315
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,610
We can do this.

316
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,330
I believe we can, like, first try.

317
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,350
It was just...

318
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,750
No, that's...

319
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,790
I was like, oh my god, I did it!

320
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,330
I was like, wow!

321
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,870
Man, I am so good at this game.

322
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,770
Alright, it'll be fine.

323
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,950
I'm pretty sure I can first try this.

324
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,810
There's no way.

325
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,670
I'm so scared you broke the game in one roll.

326
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,510
Alright, let's get him.

327
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,030
Oh, hey, it's red!

328
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,110
Is that it?

329
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,050
Is that it?

330
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,430
Is that him?

331
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,210
No way!

332
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,210
Is that him?

333
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,070
Oh!

334
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,910
Wait, that's common.

335
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,030
Okay, I was gonna be like...

336
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,590
Okay, I got pancake cookie soul core.

337
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,070
Did I do it?

338
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,830
Is that him?

339
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,590
Wait, no.

340
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,290
Who's that?

341
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,110
Rye cookie.

342
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,110
No!

343
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:57,710
No!

344
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,250
My streamer luck didn't hit it!

345
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,190
No!

346
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,410
Who are you?

347
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,370
Who are you?

348
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,270
Wait, it is me though.

349
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,270
Wait, I got me though.

350
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,850
Yay, I got me!

351
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,390
Oh, wait.

352
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,530
Is the voiceover not on?

353
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,430
Sorry, I played this game so often that I forgot to turn voiceover on.

354
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,450
Okay, wait.

355
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,330
Alright, let's see.

356
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,570
Where's the voice set?

357
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,710
I thought it was on.

358
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,750
Skill video on.

359
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,750
Yeah, it is!

360
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,550
It is on.

361
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,410
Why he no talk to me?

362
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,090
Why didn't he talk?

363
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,090
How could he?

364
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,570
I can't believe he didn't talk to me!

365
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,870
He hates you.

366
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,270
He hates you.

367
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,530
Well, it should be on.

368
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,550
Yeah, it's on English.

369
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,570
Oh, wait.

370
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,950
There was no voiceover though.

371
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,090
I was listening to it.

372
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,910
What?

373
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,110
Who said that?

374
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,790
Alright, it's the second poll.

375
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,050
It's always the second poll.

376
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,030
I lied.

377
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,270
It wasn't the first poll.

378
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,470
It's always the second poll, guys.

379
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,530
Wait, this has to be it.

380
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,030
Come on.

381
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:16,910
Give me a rip.

382
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,470
Oh my God.

383
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,210
Wait, that's two.

384
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,370
Wait, I got two.

385
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,070
It's not?

386
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,050
Wait, but look!

387
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,190
It's sparkling!

388
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,770
What is that?

389
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,810
What is that?

390
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,690
I'm gonna pinch your cheeks.

391
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,790
I'm gonna pinch them.

392
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,590
Oh my God, okay.

393
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,930
Okay, he's pretty cute.

394
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,590
I already got this cookie.

395
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,270
That's why he's not talking to me.

396
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,650
He's like, you already have me.

397
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,490
I don't want to talk to you.

398
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,490
I'm too lazy to talk to you again.

399
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,570
Who's this?

400
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,750
It's this guy?

401
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,230
Rockstar Cookie.

402
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,970
I like how he's a heal.

403
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,610
He's a medic.

404
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,210
Oh my God, he's so cool.

405
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,870
Look at this beautiful, luscious whipped cream.

406
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,290
Oh my God.

407
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,310
I wonder if he like...

408
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,710
Technically, since he's a cookie, you can like slurp up his whipped cream and then make him bald.

409
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,450
Technically.

410
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,470
This music saved my life.

411
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,910
Three epic pulls.

412
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,670
Three epics and 20 pulls.

413
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,850
What, like it's hard?

414
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,490
I mean...

415
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,890
If you're like a gamer like me, it's just every day.

416
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,510
You know?

417
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,890
It's just an average jokey day.

418
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,050
Oh yeah, I already got them.

419
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:06,870
So like...

420
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,090
So they don't talk to me.

421
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,410
They got too lazy to talk.

422
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,490
Alright.

423
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,970
I'm bringing up the overall a little bit more.

424
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,450
Alright.

425
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,050
Okay, we don't care.

426
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,230
No!

427
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,070
No!

428
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,650
What do you mean all commons?

429
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,290
What do you mean?

430
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,810
Oh my God, we don't even look at them.

431
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,710
They're worthless to me.

432
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,550
Alright, this is okay.

433
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,390
Now, now this is where we get Shadow Milk.

434
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,970
This is it.

435
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,570
It's so easy, guys.

436
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,250
Look, she's giving me the eyes.

437
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,530
That's when we know.

438
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:46,390
See?

439
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,110
Okay, there he is.

440
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,470
There he is.

441
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,010
There he is.

442
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,130
That's Shadow Milk right there.

443
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,330
There he is.

444
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,370
Right there.

445
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,670
Oh, oh, and it's...

446
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,690
Oh, there's the galaxy!

447
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,950
That has to be Shadow Milk.

448
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,450
Who else could it be?

449
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,610
Okay, we don't care.

450
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,130
We don't care.

451
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:04,970
Is it him?

452
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,010
We already got Shadow Milk.

453
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,990
Wait.

454
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,910
Wait.

455
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,750
Do I already have...

456
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:15,970
Wait.

457
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:16,930
What?

458
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,710
Wait, what?

459
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:19,830
No?

460
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,150
Oh, it's a soul store.

461
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:21,590
A soul.

462
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,090
Oh.

463
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,450
Did I just get me?

464
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:23,870
Oh, wait, no.

465
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,370
That's not me.

466
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:24,610
Okay.

467
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,750
That's not me, right?

468
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,630
Did I just get me again?

469
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,690
Did I just get...

470
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:27,910
Wait.

471
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:28,530
Oh.

472
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,310
The royal...

473
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,030
Oh, my God.

474
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,030
That's almost...

475
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,290
That's...

476
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:40,810
That's...

477
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,150
I got Dragoon!

478
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,570
He's so...

479
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,310
Oh, my God.

480
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,110
I got a Drag...

481
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,130
Wait, that's not fair.

482
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,490
That's like two cookies.

483
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,470
That's...

484
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,550
Why does he get to be two?

485
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,310
Oh, if you get 20, you unlock him.

486
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,070
Oh, I was gonna be like, there's no way.

487
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:58,750
Do I already...

488
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,450
That felt so anticlimactic.

489
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,610
If I already have him...

490
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,190
I was like, there's no way.

491
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,790
Okay.

492
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,130
Okay, the next pull is where we actually get him.

493
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,810
The next pull is it, guys.

494
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,570
It's always the next pull.

495
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,770
Your mom lets you have two cookies?

496
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,570
No, she didn't give me the eyes.

497
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:19,890
No!

498
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,810
Okay, the next pull, guys.

499
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,130
Sorry.

500
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,690
Sorry, my eyes were...

501
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,910
Sorry, my game crashed.

502
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,290
So, that pull didn't count.

503
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,270
The next pull is where it's at.

504
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,490
Let's go gambling.

505
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,110
No, okay.

506
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,110
Okay, sorry.

507
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,670
My game...

508
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:44,910
Sorry.

509
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,890
There's no way.

510
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,190
Was it all a comment?

511
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,710
She didn't give me the eyes!

512
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,670
I don't understand.

513
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,650
I don't understand.

514
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:00,850
I...

515
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,990
Okay, it's...

516
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,150
Wait, extra rewards?

517
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,030
Guarant...

518
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,050
Shall milk cookie guaranteed for beast pulls?

519
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,210
Reward cleared?

520
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,710
Oh!

521
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,010
I got...

522
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,690
Guys, guys!

523
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,090
The only reason why...

524
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,710
I didn't get shadow milk yet...

525
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,710
Is because...

526
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,030
Okay, why?

527
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,830
Okay, the...

528
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,750
Okay, the only reason why...

529
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,550
I didn't get shadow milk yet...

530
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,510
Is cause...

531
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,210
I'm not here for shadow milk.

532
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,030
I'm here for the rewards.

533
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,010
I wanna max out my level rewards first...

534
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,550
Before...

535
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,550
I actually want shadow milk.

536
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,770
Cause it's like...

537
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,770
What's the point?

538
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,990
All I'm saying is...

539
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,910
What's the point of getting shadow milk so fast...

540
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,790
If I don't get the free rewards that come with leveling up from pulls?

541
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,110
I think that's like the strat, you know?

542
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,950
As a competitive cookie run kingdom gamer...

543
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,770
That's how you should play the game.

544
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,110
That's the real strat of...

545
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,130
I don't know.

546
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,250
I mean, like...

547
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,950
I mean, do you have a kingdom like this?

548
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,010
I don't know.

549
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,410
I mean...

550
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,010
How else do you think I managed to build up a kingdom...

551
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,230
As beautiful as this?

552
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,230
Guys...

553
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,530
How else, guys?

554
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,550
Look, I have Donald Duck.

555
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,450
Does your kingdom have Donald Duck?

556
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,730
I don't think so.

557
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,730
That's right.

558
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,410
Does your kingdom have...

559
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,910
Okay...

560
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,710
Sorbet Shark Cookie?

561
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,290
That's level 80?

562
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,870
I don't think so.

563
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,270
So it's like...

564
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,910
Oh yeah, I do.

565
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,470
Does your kingdom have...

566
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,070
Whatever the hell this guy...

567
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,110
What are you?

568
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,510
Angel Cookie...

569
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,930
Oh my god, that...

570
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,690
I guess...

571
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,550
Is that what...

572
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,650
Why are you a...

573
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,630
Oh my god, okay.

574
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,610
Why are you...

575
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,130
Why do you look like that?

576
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,430
Why...

577
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,190
Why do you look like that?

578
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,470
Okay.

579
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,970
Anyway, here we go.

580
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,690
Oh my god, where are my eyes?

581
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,510
Please, witch!

582
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,610
Where are my eyes?

583
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,030
I can't say that.

584
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,490
Oh, oh!

585
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,670
She's giving me the eyes.

586
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,770
She's giving me the eyes.

587
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,010
This has to be it.

588
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,610
Biblically accurate cookie.

589
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,170
There's no way.

590
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,230
This has to be...

591
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,370
This has to be him.

592
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,630
This has to be Shadow Milk Cookie.

593
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,870
She gave me the eyes.

594
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,910
That's when you know.

595
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,590
Okay, that's the soul stone.

596
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,170
That's the soul core.

597
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,030
Purple yum cookie.

598
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,350
This has to be it, right?

599
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,390
Wait, what?

600
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,070
Was that it?

601
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,210
No, this has to be it.

602
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,270
This has to be him.

603
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,850
Who the heck is this guy?

604
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,840
Milk cookie.

605
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,730
What?

606
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,990
Oh my god.

607
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,010
Instead of...

608
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,290
Instead of Shadow Milk, it gave me milk.

609
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,850
Oh my god.

610
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,830
Oh my god, my request got lagged.

611
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,730
Just milk.

612
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:34,730
No!

613
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,530
The cookie gods only got half of my message.

614
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,450
It's okay, guys.

615
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,130
Guys, like I said, this trap...

616
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:47,690
The strat was to get as much pulls as I can.

617
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,130
So I can farm the free rewards, guys.

618
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,090
That's always been the strat, guys.

619
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,570
My mic got cut off.

620
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,810
They're like, oh, you mean milk cookie?

621
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,390
Don't worry, I got you, bro.

622
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,910
Oh my god, okay.

623
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,850
That's fine.

624
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,810
I've always wanted two buff cookies.

625
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,550
Alright, here we go.

626
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,630
Okay, the eyes.

627
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,470
The eyes.

628
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,210
That has to be it.

629
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,090
That has to be it.

630
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,990
Okay.

631
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,670
No, we're not pulling the pity, guys.

632
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,710
It's not the pity.

633
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,290
We're not getting them out of pity.

634
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,790
We're getting them via pure skill.

635
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,310
Okay.

636
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,610
Soul core.

637
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,250
Soul core.

638
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,270
Okay, this has to be him, right?

639
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,550
No, that's just...

640
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,390
Oh, wait.

641
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:42,930
What?

642
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,050
He's a squirrel!

643
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,430
Oh my...

644
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,050
I've always loved these types of hoodies.

645
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,310
Oh my god.

646
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,750
Oh, that's so cute.

647
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,370
He's like a little squirrel.

648
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,810
I wanna bite his head off.

649
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,570
Oh my god.

650
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,390
I just wanna...

651
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,670
I wanna be like...

652
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,410
Nom, nom, nom.

653
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:07,790
Hahaha.

654
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,150
When you ever feel like something's just so cute that you gotta eat it?

655
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,190
Who are you?

656
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,030
Cut me off, Kirky.

657
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,050
I...

658
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,750
I don't understand!

659
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,690
Alright, guys.

660
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,970
How many pulls does it take to hit pity?

661
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,990
Where am I at, guys?

662
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,150
Guys, I need to know.

663
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,510
Where am I at before I hit pity?

664
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,550
Guys, where am I at before I hit pity?

665
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,050
But how many pulls do I have left?

666
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,730
How many pulls?

667
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,110
13 more?

668
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,890
Okay, guys.

669
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,230
There's no way.

670
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,710
There's no way.

671
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,930
I do not get to pity.

672
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,110
There's no way.

673
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,830
The cookie gods are surely not cruel.

674
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:10,010
The cookie gods surely cannot be this cruel at me.

675
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,130
Oh!

676
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,530
Oh!

677
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:12,910
Wait!

678
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,310
Wait!

679
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:13,870
Wait!

680
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,810
That has to be it!

681
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,290
She had angry eyes!

682
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,090
Wait, what?

683
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,210
Wait, what does that mean?

684
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,470
Wait.

685
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,650
What does that mean?

686
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,150
What does the...

687
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,370
What does the spicy eyes mean?

688
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,130
Wait, what?

689
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,330
Okay.

690
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,390
Oh, it's only rare.

691
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,090
I got baited.

692
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,410
I got so baited.

693
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,810
I was like, oh my god!

694
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,570
The spicy eyes!

695
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,350
She has something spicy for me.

696
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,650
Angry eyes not good.

697
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,630
No!

698
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,450
Why?

699
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,510
Wait, that's me.

700
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,190
That's me.

701
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,670
Okay.

702
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:02,690
Alright.

703
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,950
This has to be.

704
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,190
We still have 10 more pulls before it's pity.

705
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,290
Oh my god.

706
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,030
Oh my god.

707
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,790
Guys, I'm just in a rut.

708
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,750
I'm just in a rut right now.

709
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,870
But like, it can only go up now.

710
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,950
I've hit bottom.

711
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,010
Guys, it's alright.

712
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,730
I've just hit rock bottom, but it can only go up from now, right?

713
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,190
It can only get up right from now, guys.

714
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,230
Why are you so angry?

715
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,590
What have I done to you?

716
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,890
All I do is give her money.

717
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,830
What have I done to her?

718
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,410
I give you all my money.

719
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,450
What else do you want more?

720
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,690
What more do you want?

721
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,650
Today's been a very bad day, okay?

722
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,790
Oh my god.

723
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,690
Why does it keep going?

724
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,930
You ungrateful witch.

725
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,270
I knew we should have burned her.

726
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,970
I never trust the witches.

727
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,270
I've known since yesterday's God of War.

728
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,330
Never trust witches.

729
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,590
We should have just burned her.

730
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,670
Burned her at the stake.

731
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,290
And just steal her.

732
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,370
I don't understand.

733
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,990
Why don't we just steal her cookbook and make our own cookies?

734
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,430
We don't need her.

735
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,550
Do we really need her?

736
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,110
Okay, how many pulls do I have left, guys, before I hit pity?

737
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:43,930
Yes, how many pulls left until I hit pity?

738
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,870
Okay, six more.

739
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,110
Guys, we're gonna hit it.

740
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,350
We're gonna hit it, guys.

741
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,850
Wait, 40?

742
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,530
Oh my god.

743
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,690
I don't understand.

744
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,790
It's okay.

745
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,090
It's okay.

746
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,110
We still have...

747
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,050
We can make it.

748
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,410
We will get it before we hit the pity system.

749
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,350
I believe.

750
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,490
I believe.

751
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,110
It's okay.

752
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,510
We're gonna hit it.

753
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,410
There's no way.

754
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,210
You're all out to get me.

755
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,890
They're actually...

756
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,030
The entire world...

757
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,410
Today has...

758
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,530
Oh my god, the entire world is out.

759
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,170
No, I have one left.

760
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,420
Oh no.

761
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,600
I've never seen anyone hit R.

762
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,320
Don't say that.

763
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,500
No, don't say that.

764
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,980
That's okay.

765
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,560
Now, don't worry.

766
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,880
We're doing ones now.

767
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,940
We're doing ones now.

768
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,140
That's when we know.

769
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,600
Okay.

770
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,440
So we can, you know, increase the anticipation.

771
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,740
We pull it one by one.

772
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,860
No, we're not gonna hit R.

773
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,660
We have to hit our pity.

774
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,200
If I pull it one by one...

775
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes, queen.

776
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,680
Cast light yourself.

777
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,400
There's no way.

778
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,900
There's no way.

779
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,260
If I do it one by one...

780
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,940
If I...

781
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,700
Queen, I'm stalling.

782
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,240
No, guys.

783
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,340
If I do it one by one, surely I can get it before I hit heart pity.

784
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,280
Come on, give me the eyes, you old witch.

785
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,940
I'm lighting up.

786
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,700
I'm lighting up my torch right now.

787
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,560
Come on.

788
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,200
Give me those eyes.

789
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,460
Give me those eyes.

790
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,040
Oh no, I have four more pulls.

791
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,240
Come on.

792
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,620
You know you want to.

793
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,700
Just give me...

794
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,260
Oh my god, have I ever told you how beautiful you look today, miss witch?

795
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,160
Have I...

796
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,860
Light the pitchforks.

797
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,980
Guys, get ready.

798
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,920
We're gonna form an angry mob.

799
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,720
Guys, it's okay.

800
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,220
We're gonna get it.

801
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,440
No, no, no.

802
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,280
Oh my god.

803
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,540
You look so...

804
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,800
Any other eyes?

805
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,840
Why can't you have any other eyes?

806
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,670
I...

807
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,150
Why?

808
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,050
You stupid gumball cookie.

809
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,270
Guys.

810
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,770
Toki's luck died so yours did.

811
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:24,790
How about if I never... Guys, if I never do the final pull, we might never know if I got it or not.

812
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:36,230
If we never do the final pull, maybe we'll never know.

813
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,150
We'll never know.

814
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,530
Wow.

815
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,040
99% of gattlers quit before they hit it big.

816
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,080
Oh my god.

817
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:03,900
And she still kissed me in the eye.

818
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,550
I'm gonna banish this cookie from my world.

819
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,290
Give me a sec.

820
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,070
What's her name?

821
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,230
Carrot cookie?

822
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,590
That's her name, right?

823
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,590
I'm gonna...

824
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,530
Where is she?

825
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,790
Where is she?

826
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,410
Where is carrot cookie?

827
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,530
She no longer lives in my kingdom.

828
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,090
She...

829
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,670
What did she do for existing in my kingdom?

830
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,010
I shall banish you.

831
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,550
Alright, how am I... I'm gonna find you.

832
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,150
Guys.

833
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,830
What's... I'm gonna find you.

834
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:08,550
Where are you?

835
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,690
Where are you?

836
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,310
Where are you?

837
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,390
How do I find her?

838
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,330
How do I find her?

839
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,810
How do I find her in my kingdom?

840
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,190
No, it was the witch's fault.

841
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,850
Not hers!

842
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,010
No!

843
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:29,470
No!

844
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,250
Dashboard!

845
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,090
Oh,

846
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,170
it's so over for you.

847
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,750
Where's the dashboard?

848
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,250
Where's the dashboard?

849
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,710
I definitely know where it is.

850
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,730
No, don't tell her!

851
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,450
Bottom left corner.

852
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,250
Oh, there you are.

853
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:50,770
Alright.

854
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,350
Where are you, carrot cookie?

855
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,290
Oh, she didn't even exist in my... Oh, is it true?

856
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,130
Does she never exist?

857
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,070
No, no, there is.

858
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,070
Alright, carrot cookie.

859
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,270
I'm gonna find you, carrot cookie.

860
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,650
Where are you?

861
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,510
I'm gonna find... Wait, Tails is not in?

862
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,770
Don't get in here, Tails.

863
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,590
Oh!

864
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,850
Oh, I can't even put... Okay.

865
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,190
Where is she?

866
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,010
Where... Run, carrot cookie!

867
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:15,910
Run!

868
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,030
Where is she?

869
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,190
Where are you?

870
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,290
Oh, there you are.

871
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:22,970
That's right.

872
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,110
I'm gonna throw you in the goddamn pool.

873
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,570
That's what happens to cookies, right?

874
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,810
I'm gonna dissolve you.

875
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,870
That's right.

876
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,950
I'm gonna make you so soggy, no one will love you, carrot cookie.

877
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,190
No one will love you.

878
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,830
A favor sent dead.

879
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,790
There's a black hole?!

880
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:47,990
Oh!

881
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,650
Oh!

882
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,910
That's what... You could have been shadow milk.

883
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,110
You could have been shadow milk!

884
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,690
Now into the black hole you go!

885
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,010
Goodbye.

886
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,850
To the shadow realm you go!

887
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,450
No!

888
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,970
She's dead!

889
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,650
No!

890
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:22,970
Oh, yeah.

891
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,090
How was the sound on the end?

892
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,730
Carrot cookie did nothing wrong.

893
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,590
That was Roger Fugg's favorite cookie!

894
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,870
Try never thinking with a super chat.

895
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,190
Thank you, thank you.

896
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,370
That's right.

897
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,430
Goodbye.

898
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,270
Now let me replace you with a real cookie.

899
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,450
With a real cookie.

900
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,670
Tails.

901
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:51,910
Tails.

902
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,470
That's right.

903
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,030
That's a real cookie right there.

904
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,670
My man, Tails.

905
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,390
She was innocent.

906
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,130
That's right.

907
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,490
Tails, my boy.

908
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,670
Tails.

909
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,270
Also this guy.

910
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,430
He looks...

911
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:10,770
Wait, no.

912
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,490
Is that... That's sort of... That's like me.

913
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,710
Look at that guy.

914
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,750
He's just like me.

915
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,670
He looks just like me.

916
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,270
Alright, nice.

917
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:23,650
Alright, let's see.

918
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,850
Oh my god.

919
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,010
Justice for Carrot Cake.

920
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,850
Thank you.

921
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,970
Super chat.

922
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,150
Thank you, thank you.

923
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,170
Oh my god.

924
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,050
I love the intro though.

925
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,550
It's like a little puppeteer.

926
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,250
Collect your pity, you streamer.

927
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:57,890
Totally.

928
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,390
Oh my god.

929
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,370
I don't think I've ever hit pity before.

930
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:24,090
I think this is the very first time I've done gotcha streams for four years.

931
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,810
Oh my god.

932
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:35,430
Today was just not one of those days.

933
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,890
Guys, that's okay.

934
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,370
I take all your bad luck into me.

935
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:55,170
Today's the day where you donate all the bad luck to me, guys.

936
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,310
And then, and now, now you use my link, guys.

937
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:08,430
Use my link and download on the description and description and pinned comment.

938
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,730
It'll be, I swear, it'll be so different.

939
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,910
Oh yeah, there's costumes too.

940
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:14,530
Wait!

941
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,790
Do I have Candy Apple Cookie?

942
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,390
Do I have her?

943
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,350
I don't know if I have Candy Apple Cookie.

944
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,150
She's so cute.

945
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,150
Wait, do I have Candy Apple Cookie?

946
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:30,670
No?

947
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,490
Alright, we go again.

948
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,430
You always get...

949
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,350
Doki...

950
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,490
Doki walked so the dragons could fly.

951
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,790
It's okay, my luck will change again.

952
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,690
Surely it won't go... Surely!

953
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,290
Surely it's not gonna happen again, right?

954
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,190
Oh man, that'll be...

955
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,790
That'll be way too silly, right, guys?

956
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,210
Wait, is there...

957
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,390
There's no way.

958
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,730
Alright, witch.

959
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,150
Give me those eyes.

960
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,390
Come on.

961
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,130
What have I done?

962
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,090
I don't understand.

963
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,470
What have I done other than banishing Carrot to the Shadow Realm?

964
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:20,730
What have...

965
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,810
What have I done to you?!

966
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,170
I didn't even burn you yet!

967
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,270
I...

968
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,030
I didn't even burn her!

969
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,150
Wait, I didn't check her eyes.

970
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,750
Oh no, I didn't check her eyes.

971
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:33,730
I have to watch this.

972
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,590
I...

973
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,270
I didn't...

974
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,810
I didn't check her eyes.

975
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,170
I didn't watch her eyes.

976
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,330
Carrot Cookie was your best friend.

977
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,790
What is this?

978
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,530
Is this?

979
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,370
Wait!

980
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:55,970
Wait!

981
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,060
I did it!

982
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,680
Alright, you know what?

983
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,320
Now I definitely know who I wanna send.

984
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,020
Oh my god, and I got...

985
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh my god, she's so cute!

986
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,960
Oh my god!

987
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,320
She's like a vampire cookie!

988
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,260
Alright, now I definitely know who I wanna send to the Shadow Realm.

989
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,880
Now, our...

990
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,800
Candy Apple for screenings.

991
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,300
Use this package to make this cookie even.

992
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,300
Alright, where are you?

993
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,160
Where are you?

994
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,860
Where are you?

995
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,540
I'm gonna...

996
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm gonna find you.

997
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,240
I'm gonna...

998
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,860
You little shit!

999
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,520
You little...

1000
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,260
That's right!

1001
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,400
You gave me heart pity!

1002
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,660
Why can't you be like her?

1003
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,020
Wait, let me... give me a sec.

1004
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,300
Before I put you down, I need someone to...

1005
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,140
Okay, I need you to be here.

1006
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,980
And then...

1007
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,120
Let me grab her.

1008
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,700
Alright, where are you?

1009
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,440
Let me grab you over.

1010
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,080
Oh, please!

1011
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,100
Alright!

1012
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:06,840
Alright!

1013
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,060
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1014
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,540
Can I move the chair?

1015
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,340
Wait, how do I move the chair?

1016
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,000
Guys, this is very important.

1017
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,940
This...

1018
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,170
Guys...

1019
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,950
I need to be able to move this...

1020
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:23,630
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1021
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:24,350
Okay.

1022
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:26,950
Nice, alright.

1023
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,830
I'm gonna put this here.

1024
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,690
And then, I'm gonna...

1025
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:35,730
Alright.

1026
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,690
And now, I'm gonna put this...

1027
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,510
I'm gonna put you right here.

1028
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,250
Okay, wait.

1029
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,170
Oh, no!

1030
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,910
Okay, I'm gonna put you...

1031
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:47,890
Oh, my God.

1032
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,630
I need this to be right here.

1033
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,070
Would you like to place here instead?

1034
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,870
Yes.

1035
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,390
Okay, now I'm gonna put you right here.

1036
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,010
And I'm gonna put you right here.

1037
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,190
Alright, perfect.

1038
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,310
Okay.

1039
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,010
Alright, where are you?

1040
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,170
Okay, you watch.

1041
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:06,610
Alright.

1042
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,510
Alright!

1043
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:09,930
Wait, I can get another chair.

1044
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:10,770
Give me a sec, wait.

1045
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,330
I need more.

1046
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,290
Give me a sec, I'm angry.

1047
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,550
I need more chairs.

1048
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,570
I need more chairs.

1049
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,090
Where are the chairs?

1050
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,210
Where are the chairs in this world?

1051
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,010
I need more chairs.

1052
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:26,990
Okay.

1053
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,310
Yes, where are the chairs here?

1054
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,730
There needs to be more seats.

1055
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,170
Nobody gives me hard pity.

1056
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,270
Oh, no.

1057
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,430
This is a show now.

1058
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,490
No one gives me hard pity.

1059
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,390
In this world.

1060
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,010
I already had a bad day.

1061
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,390
Chairs where?

1062
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,570
How am I supposed to bring...

1063
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,430
How am I supposed to...

1064
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,270
Oh, wait, we should have this one.

1065
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,570
Front row seats.

1066
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,370
Right here.

1067
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,010
There we go.

1068
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,570
Okay, that's one chair.

1069
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,350
That's another chair.

1070
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,750
Wait, is this...

1071
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,330
Does it give me more?

1072
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,070
Oh, it gives me more options to look at.

1073
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,470
Alright, guys.

1074
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,990
Give me a sec, I'm just trying to find more chairs.

1075
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,350
Punishing pity is wild.

1076
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,390
No one...

1077
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:28,330
This is a lesson to all of you.

1078
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,750
You shall never give Doki pity ever again.

1079
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,530
Or you know what's gonna happen.

1080
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:36,470
You know what, let's put more.

1081
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,410
Okay, there we go.

1082
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,950
Alright, there we go.

1083
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,110
Now I can have like two.

1084
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,850
Okay, and then we need one more.

1085
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,090
This is a cat in an event.

1086
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,710
You cannot delete.

1087
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,810
You cannot delete this account now.

1088
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,290
History has been made today.

1089
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,890
History has been made.

1090
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,290
Alright, nice.

1091
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,170
And then I'll buy this.

1092
00:49:58,690 --> 00:49:59,530
And I'm gonna put...

1093
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:01,710
Alright, here we go.

1094
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:03,750
Okay.

1095
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:05,330
We'll be removed.

1096
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,230
Oh, that's gonna be removed?

1097
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,170
Oh, no.

1098
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,150
How do I redo that?

1099
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,250
Undo.

1100
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,450
I like that chair.

1101
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,610
That was the original chair.

1102
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,480
Oh my god.

1103
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,740
I actually really like that particular chair.

1104
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,420
I want another one of that chair.

1105
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,960
Wait, is this a chair?

1106
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,240
Are you a chair?

1107
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,440
No, you're not.

1108
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,200
Wait, I need to undo so many things.

1109
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,360
Okay, wait.

1110
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,600
Okay, good.

1111
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,940
Okay, we need to keep this chair.

1112
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,320
This chair is like the OG chair.

1113
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,260
Okay, wait, no.

1114
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,280
No.

1115
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,360
Oh my god, it's so difficult.

1116
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,460
I'm just making a scene here.

1117
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,440
You don't understand.

1118
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,620
I've been through so much.

1119
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,200
Alright, wait, let me move this right here.

1120
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,100
So it's like the center, you know?

1121
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,960
So like, it's the center of everything.

1122
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,820
Okay, let me yoink a different chair.

1123
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,780
Let me...

1124
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,420
Guys, oh my god.

1125
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,160
This is a perf...

1126
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,840
Let me yoink a small chair somewhere.

1127
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,840
There has to be a small chair somewhere here that I can yoink.

1128
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,740
To make it complete.

1129
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,480
The center stage.

1130
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,220
I just need one small chair.

1131
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,060
That's all I need to make this complete.

1132
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,660
What is the matter?

1133
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,880
Happy 4th year anniversary.

1134
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,820
No one gives me hard pity.

1135
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,540
I refuse.

1136
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,160
I refuse to ever get hard pity ever again.

1137
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:39,950
It's never...

1138
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:40,900
What is this?

1139
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,440
I need to duplicate this.

1140
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,680
Is it this?

1141
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,620
No, that's rotate.

1142
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,780
What are you?

1143
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,460
Okay, see and shop.

1144
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,420
I need another one.

1145
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,620
Do I have?

1146
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,060
Buy one.

1147
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,420
There we go.

1148
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,200
Now it's perfect.

1149
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,440
Okay.

1150
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,380
There we go.

1151
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,520
Oh my god, yeah.

1152
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,140
Wait, okay, I'm still buying this.

1153
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,280
I'm buying another one too.

1154
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,280
Alright.

1155
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,340
If I move this, we don't need this house.

1156
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,140
Wait.

1157
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,780
Get rid of this.

1158
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,880
That's not important.

1159
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,640
That's...

1160
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,070
Get rid of that.

1161
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,290
That's not as...

1162
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,930
That gives me more space.

1163
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,590
That actually...

1164
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,830
Oh my god, thank...

1165
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:32,570
Okay, here we go.

1166
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:33,330
Okay.

1167
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,750
Wait, no.

1168
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,650
Yes.

1169
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,450
Give me... I don't...

1170
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:40,110
Okay.

1171
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,310
Undo.

1172
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:43,190
Here we go.

1173
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,050
Now it's perfect.

1174
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:45,530
Now...

1175
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,250
Now it's perfect.

1176
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:48,050
Alright.

1177
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,050
Alright, everybody, come in here.

1178
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,370
For a show.

1179
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,430
Get ready for a show, everyone.

1180
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,870
I need BTS to be here.

1181
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,690
We were so close.

1182
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,770
Alright, I'm gonna grab...

1183
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,790
I'm gonna...

1184
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,410
Is this BTS?

1185
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,410
Okay.

1186
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,530
Alright, we're gonna grab...

1187
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,950
We're gonna grab Tails in here, too.

1188
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,870
Tails gotta watch.

1189
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:18,030
He needs to know he can't disappoint me.

1190
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,850
Alright, Tails, where are you?

1191
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,870
Where are you, Tails?

1192
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,670
Woah, that's not what I wanted.

1193
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,390
Tails, where are you?

1194
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,290
Tails?

1195
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,550
Where are you, Tails?

1196
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:30,430
You're here.

1197
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,230
You're gonna be in for a show.

1198
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,550
Leave them out of it.

1199
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:35,910
Tails, where are you?

1200
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,230
I know you're hiding, Tails.

1201
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,390
I know you're here somewhere.

1202
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,530
They don't deserve this treatment.

1203
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:44,850
Tails...

1204
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,730
Oh, you were trying to hide, little guy.

1205
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,450
Were you trying to hide?

1206
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:58,890
That's right.

1207
00:53:59,470 --> 00:53:59,970
Alright.

1208
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,370
Where's BTS?

1209
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,510
Where is he?

1210
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,890
Woah, is that you?

1211
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:08,430
Who are you?

1212
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,290
Oh, that's right.

1213
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,210
You're gonna watch this, BTS.

1214
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,950
You're in for a show.

1215
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,410
Oh, you are definitely gonna be in for a show, Mr. BTS.

1216
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,730
Oh, you're gonna run?

1217
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:25,730
No, no.

1218
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,310
You're all gonna watch this.

1219
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,630
None of you are leaving.

1220
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,270
Big Cookie runs safe.

1221
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:35,570
That's right.

1222
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,510
No one gives me hard pity.

1223
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,250
Alright.

1224
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,410
Don't leave.

1225
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,650
None of you are leaving.

1226
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,630
None of you are leaving.

1227
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:46,650
Alright.

1228
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,970
Who else?

1229
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:55,850
Who else am I dragging into this?

1230
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:57,010
Who else?

1231
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,750
They all have to learn.

1232
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,670
Oh, Goofy.

1233
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:02,710
It's time.

1234
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,210
I'm gonna show you the harsh reality of this world.

1235
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:08,810
Gosh.

1236
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,570
Gosh, Mickey.

1237
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,770
What's gonna happen to us?

1238
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,750
Who else?

1239
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:19,990
Oh, also me.

1240
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,610
This is basically me.

1241
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,970
I need myself to know too.

1242
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,010
Alright.

1243
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,090
You think you can leave?

1244
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,490
You think you guys can leave?

1245
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:34,790
No.

1246
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,870
No.

1247
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,110
You guys all get front row seats.

1248
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:49,190
Oh, she's okay.

1249
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,990
It was a really bad dream.

1250
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,790
Guys, it was just a really bad dream.

1251
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:54,470
She's okay.

1252
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,010
It was just...

1253
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,010
It was a really bad dream.

1254
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,270
Guys.

1255
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,330
Guys.

1256
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,170
Guys, it was just a really, really bad dream.

1257
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,390
But they're all okay now.

1258
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:07,830
They're all okay.

1259
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,670
You are not... Get back on the chair.

1260
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,390
Get your ass back on the chair.

1261
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,850
I refuse to let you all leave this chair.

1262
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:16,050
You can... That's right.

1263
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,130
That's right.

1264
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:17,830
Oh, you guys.

1265
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,350
I'm gonna put you back on this chair.

1266
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,150
You're not leaving this chair.

1267
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,370
That's goddamn right.

1268
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:24,330
Okay, where are you?

1269
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,330
The main event.

1270
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,230
Oh, you traveled so far.

1271
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:28,650
You...

1272
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,030
You walked so far away.

1273
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,550
Oh my god.

1274
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,230
You thought you could escape?

1275
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:43,870
You really thought you could escape this world?

1276
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:45,670
You really...

1277
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,390
Alright, everybody.

1278
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,690
Say goodbye.

1279
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,410
Never give me hard pity again.

1280
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,030
That's right.

1281
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,670
You see that?

1282
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,570
You all saw that?

1283
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,950
You will never give me hard pity.

1284
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,190
Away he goes.

1285
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,050
That's right.

1286
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:19,910
I deserved all... Now run back to the other cookies and tell them what I did.

1287
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,910
That's goddamn right.

1288
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,270
Spread the word throughout the kingdoms.

1289
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,930
Doki will never get hard pity again.

1290
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,030
What is wrong?

1291
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,930
I had a really rough day, guys.

1292
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,550
I don't know if you guys...

1293
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:47,490
Guys, does it seem obvious that I had a really rough day?

1294
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,650
Alright, there we go.

1295
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:55,110
Now they know.

1296
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,750
I'm just letting it out on the cookies, guys.

1297
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,550
I'm just letting it out on the cookies.

1298
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,770
Oh, what happened?

1299
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,270
Oh, whoops.

1300
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,930
My game crashed.

1301
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,510
It was too powerful.

1302
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,290
It was too strong.

1303
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:24,630
It was too strong.

1304
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:34,430
The shadow milk fought too much crime.

1305
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:37,050
I was like, wait, why did it freeze?

1306
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:42,990
The game was scared.

1307
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,450
It's okay.

1308
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,090
It's okay.

1309
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:45,290
It's okay.

1310
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,290
They think they can kick me out.

1311
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:46,830
I'm back.

1312
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,410
They can't kick me out.

1313
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:49,990
I'm back.

1314
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:52,750
That's right.

1315
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,630
I totally didn't screen record.

1316
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:56,650
That's right.

1317
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,130
They thought they could kick me out but I'm back.

1318
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:02,650
And my torture chamber, oh it's still here.

1319
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:04,510
My...

1320
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:11,590
My live, my live banishment, my banishment tool is still here.

1321
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:16,150
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1322
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,370
Thank you, thank you.

1323
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:18,310
No, no, no, sorry.

1324
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:18,890
My live...

1325
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,390
my...

1326
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,450
my feels good chamber.

1327
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,890
Yes, my feels good chamber is still here.

1328
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:26,470
Yeah.

1329
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:31,690
All right.

1330
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:32,410
All right.

1331
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:32,810
But yes.

1332
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,030
I had it.

1333
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,570
All right.

1334
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:35,010
All right.

1335
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,610
Let's let's actually let's go back to costumes guys.

1336
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,850
Let's go back to costumes.

1337
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,430
Wait, which one do I have?

1338
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,090
Do I have any of these?

1339
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,450
I can't tell.

1340
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,130
Gotcha history.

1341
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:47,950
Do I have him?

1342
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:49,990
I don't know.

1343
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:55,370
Or do I have the do I have the royal hanbok and the cozy hanbok?

1344
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:58,550
I mean, wait, are these new?

1345
00:59:58,650 --> 00:59:59,910
I don't know if I have them.

1346
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:00,970
How do you tell?

1347
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,170
Your own...

1348
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,950
How can I... Oh, here you go.

1349
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:08,570
Not found.

1350
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:09,530
Oh, I don't.

1351
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,290
I don't have them.

1352
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,190
All right, it's time.

1353
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:19,010
Now, now that they saw what I've done, they'll give me everything I want now.

1354
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,190
There's no way.

1355
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:23,490
They saw it all.

1356
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,310
They've learned.

1357
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:31,230
Wait, how do I... How can I tell if it's... How can I tell if it's like good?

1358
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,590
Oh, hey, there's three!

1359
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,970
Wait, no.

1360
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,630
That's not good.

1361
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:44,690
Oh, don't make me... Don't make me put you... What's your name?

1362
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:45,670
What's your name?

1363
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:46,690
Okay, what?

1364
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:46,890
What?

1365
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:52,850
All right, frost queen cookie, where is she?

1366
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,930
What does frost queen cookie look like?

1367
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,950
Oh, there you go.

1368
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,470
I'm gonna put you here.

1369
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:06,390
Oh.

1370
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:11,830
You better give me... You better not give me pity again.

1371
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,130
Oh, you better not.

1372
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:15,390
This will be your fate.

1373
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:16,070
You see this?

1374
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:19,150
I don't know who this kid is, but you see that guy?

1375
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,910
That's gonna be you.

1376
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,550
All right, so you better get me my costume.

1377
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:24,990
All right, here we go.

1378
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,490
Don't worry.

1379
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,530
They'll listen now.

1380
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:30,170
Don't worry.

1381
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,330
They'll listen now.

1382
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,870
If in within 10... If I don't get this within 10 pulls...

1383
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:39,890
Doki, please.

1384
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,650
Poor cookie.

1385
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:45,490
Doki, stop.

1386
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:46,790
What is it?

1387
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,290
There's no innocent cookies.

1388
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,630
There's no such thing as an innocent cookie.

1389
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,170
Don't bow to oppression.

1390
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:58,770
Oh my god, five more pulls!

1391
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,650
Five more, frost queen.

1392
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,350
Five more.

1393
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,650
Oh, oh.

1394
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,830
Oh, that's not... That looks Halloween themed.

1395
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,750
Halloween themed.

1396
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,050
The witch's fate of the sweet night.

1397
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,110
Oh, but she is pretty.

1398
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:16,290
Oh, it's a witch.

1399
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,310
No, it's a goddamn witch.

1400
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:19,250
It's...

1401
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,270
No, it's a goddamn witch.

1402
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,270
I'm done with witches.

1403
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,250
Editor isn't gonna be able to use half of this footage.

1404
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,130
Simple-minded.

1405
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1406
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,190
Thank you.

1407
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:34,750
Thank you.

1408
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,170
I'm done with witches.

1409
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:37,610
Two more.

1410
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,690
Are you serious?

1411
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,770
Oh,

1412
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,400
no, guys.

1413
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,860
Yeah, it's not looking so good for the frost witch.

1414
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,100
Oh, this is my last pull.

1415
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,080
All right.

1416
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,650
All right.

1417
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:14,650
Okay.

1418
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,050
Oh, no.

1419
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,670
Don't execute her.

1420
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:22,310
Oh, I almost brought you two.

1421
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,870
You guys didn't even get anything.

1422
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,370
Wait, how did you live?

1423
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:27,110
Back in that portal.

1424
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,210
There we go.

1425
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,670
It doesn't even know.

1426
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,550
All right, where are you?

1427
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:36,450
Oh, you thought you got away?

1428
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,910
Oh, sherbert cookie.

1429
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,070
Oh, where are you, sherbert cookie?

1430
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:41,670
What do you look like?

1431
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,290
Oh, where are you, sherbert cookie?

1432
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,370
You think you are?

1433
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,530
You think you're exempt from all of this?

1434
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,890
Not once, but twice.

1435
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:58,910
Is this you?

1436
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,010
I can always see the warm lights of snowfall village.

1437
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,410
Oh, you want to see a war?

1438
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:08,250
I guess you're never gonna see any light no more.

1439
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:12,030
And now you'll never see light again.

1440
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:12,610
And...

1441
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,390
At no mercy.

1442
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,290
What about you, cotton cookie?

1443
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,750
All right, where are you, cotton cookie?

1444
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,310
Where are you?

1445
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:27,390
I'll never show.

1446
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,090
I'll never show remorse ever again.

1447
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,770
I'll never feel ever again.

1448
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,640
I'll never...

1449
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,000
Nobody can be happy ever again.

1450
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,260
Where is she?

1451
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,920
What does she look like?

1452
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,420
You cannot protect her from her fate.

1453
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:48,940
What's your name?

1454
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,240
What's your name?

1455
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:50,960
Is this you?

1456
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,500
I'm gonna google your original outfit.

1457
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,660
You think you can hide just because I don't know what your default cookie looks like?

1458
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,640
Cotton, cotton cookie.

1459
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,660
Oh, I know what you look like.

1460
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,000
I downloaded your image.

1461
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,900
I know what you look like now.

1462
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,060
I know.

1463
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,720
I got your picture.

1464
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,780
No one is safe from her.

1465
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,520
I got your picture, you little cookie.

1466
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,880
That's right.

1467
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,200
Bounty hunted.

1468
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,700
I volunteer as tribute for cotton.

1469
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,100
No, there's no tributes here.

1470
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,680
Only...

1471
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,240
only...

1472
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,420
this fate.

1473
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,120
Oh, you thought... oh!

1474
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,180
I believe everyone has a warm...

1475
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,980
I don't know.

1476
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,860
You thought putting on a different costume?

1477
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,100
I reckon...

1478
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,500
Goodbye.

1479
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,300
She's wrong.

1480
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,520
She's... she's just a child.

1481
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,700
Hey, nice.

1482
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,100
Oh my god.

1483
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,140
I fed the vortex so much it's level 10 now.

1484
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,740
It's a level 10 black hole.

1485
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,060
There's no good in this world.

1486
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,340
Not anymore.

1487
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,380
The light...

1488
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,500
the goodness of my heart has been gone forever.

1489
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,580
It's been snuffed out.

1490
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,880
The vortex is eating good.

1491
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,380
Tonight.

1492
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,460
It's been fun so far, guys.

1493
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:48,650
Oh my god.

1494
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:52,090
But yeah, if you guys enjoy seeing me feed cookies into the black hole...

1495
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:56,290
in my feels good chamber, you should check out the game.

1496
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,470
You should check out the game and download it yourself.

1497
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,770
Pin in my... pin in my...

1498
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,250

1499
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:03,090
This is not...

1500
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:08,630
You can save the cookies in your own game.

1501
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:12,350
Yeah, but you check out the game.

1502
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,350
Um, pin in the chat or in my description below.

All right, so I'm pretty sure there's like a ton of other new updates.

1505
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,110
Uh, what's kingdom affairs?

1506
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:28,110
Oh, it's like... wait, there's like the pavilion of promise?

1507
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:29,530
What's that?

1508
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:33,210
Oh, oh my god, cookie!

1509
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,830
I never got him.

1510
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,270
I never got you.

1511
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:38,130
Wake up.

1512
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:39,850
Wake up.

1513
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,710
Wake up.

1514
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:45,390
Don't make me do it.

1515
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,350
Wake up.

1516
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:47,790
Wake up.

1517
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:49,410
Wake up.

1518
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,210
I'm already angry.

1519
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,130
Don't make...

1520
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:55,530
Wake up.

1521
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:56,810
Come on.

1522
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,510
Who are your friends?

1523
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,770
And where do they...

1524
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,430
If you don't wake up, I'll find your fam.

1525
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,010
I'm sorry.

1526
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:06,830
I'm sorry.

1527
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:07,470
This is sponsored.

1528
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:08,810
I'm so sorry, cookie run.

1529
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:09,910
I'm so sorry.

1530
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:12,310
I'm so sorry.

1531
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,010
Please wake up.

1532
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:18,390
You gotta wake up now.

1533
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,150
You gotta wake up.

1534
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,650
Don't leave him be.

1535
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:29,010
Don't leave him.

1536
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,150
Come on.

1537
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:34,850
Oh, it'll be a shame if I find out where your family lives if you don't wake up.

1538
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:35,930
It'll be a shame.

1539
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,730
Guys, who are his family?

1540
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:42,170
Who are your... come on.

1541
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:44,290
Oh, there's seven more attempts.

1542
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,410
All right, don't worry.

1543
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:51,650
Six more attempts.

1544
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,830
Stay asleep.

1545
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:56,570
All right, come on.

1546
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:57,310
Come on.

1547
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,950
I'm gonna take them to a special chamber.

1548
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,330
My feels good chamber.

1549
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,730
Come on.

1550
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:06,610
Last four attempts, little guy.

1551
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:10,110
Last... Oh, you're gonna... Are you gonna give me pity?

1552
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,970
Are you really gonna give me pity, too?

1553
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,950
You know what happened to the last guy that gave me pity, little guy?

1554
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,190
Oh, he doesn't exist no more.

1555
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:22,190
He doesn't need that.

1556
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:28,350
He's trying his best to wake up.

1557
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:36,050
Oh, you didn't want to wake up.

1558
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,050
I see.

1559
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,830
I see.

1560
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:42,610
He...

1561
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,510
I'll remember that guy.

1562
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:53,350
I'll remember him.

1563
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:56,170
He saved himself.

1564
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:01,990
It's so over.

1565
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,230
Oh, hey, I received a gift.

1566
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:08,030
Wait, I need to change my guy.

1567
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:08,930
Give me a sec.

1568
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,930
Give me a sec before I do anything.

1569
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:14,410
I gotta change my guy.

1570
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,530
I remember how I changed him.

1571
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:18,670
It is like... Is it my cookie?

1572
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:19,390
Yeah.

1573
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,170
All right, what do I have?

1574
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,430
All right.

1575
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,660
What should my new name be?

1576
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:34,550
What should I... No pity.

1577
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,030
No!

1578
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:46,390
I wish I could.

1579
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:47,130
Wait.

1580
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,390
No!

1581
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,770
I got you special characters!

1582
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:55,750
Wait.

1583
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:02,110
Okay, no, that's not threatening enough.

1584
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,410
That's not...

1585
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,210
I don't know what to do.

1586
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:04,270
I don't know what to do.

1587
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,590
I need something that's equally threatening.

1588
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:07,820
I need...

1589
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:10,510
Smile.

1590
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:11,470
There we go.

1591
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,390
No pity, smile.

1592
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:20,070
All right.

1593
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,250
No pity, smile, cookie.

1594
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,550
All right, there we go.

1595
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:25,270
Let's see.

1596
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,870
What kind of clothes do I want here?

1597
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:28,590
Huh?

1598
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,690
Look around the world is...

1599
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:31,590
How do I... Closet.

1600
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:32,110
There you go.

1601
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:32,750
All right.

1602
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:36,230
Let me go put on some cute... Something cute.

1603
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:38,110
Something... Actually, no.

1604
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,930
Something that matches how I feel right now, honestly.

1605
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:44,390
I need something that matches how I... There we go.

1606
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:45,030
Yeah.

1607
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:46,530
Yeah.

1608
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:50,350
Yeah.

1609
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:51,630
Wait, what's this one?

1610
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,450
Oh, no.

1611
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:53,270
No, actually, no.

1612
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:54,210
This one works more.

1613
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,150
And then...

1614
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:57,930
Yeah, what's his name?

1615
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,470
Armor of the Great Destroyer?

1616
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,710
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1617
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:01,970
That sounds... Yeah.

1618
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:03,370
That sounds...

1619
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:08,470
That's... That sounds right, you know?

1620
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,110
No, I...

1621
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:12,350
I agree.

1622
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:14,810
I agree with that statement.

1623
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,170
And then...

1624
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:20,030
Let's see.

1625
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:23,750
If there's Tokio Destroyer...

1626
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,750
All right, let's see.

1627
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:31,270
Actually, I like the shoes though.

1628
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:32,290
The shoes are really cute.

1629
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,070
I like it.

1630
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,070
What's this?

1631
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:39,090
Chocolate?

1632
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,210
No, I don't want earrings.

1633
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,030
I don't want any earrings on me.

1634
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,190
What about wings, gloves?

1635
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,350
Oh, what I'm holding!

1636
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,170
All right, what do I have?

1637
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:52,250
Yeah, the hammer's nice.

1638
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:53,370
I think a hammer is good.

1639
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,550
All right, we'll take the hammer and then...

1640
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,390
Then we'll put...

1641
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:03,010
What should we do for hair color?

1642
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:03,790
For hair?

1643
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,450
Actually, no, I think... I actually like this hair.

1644
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:08,650
This hair is cute.

1645
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,610
Yes, wait, wait, wait.

1646
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:12,610
I like this one.

1647
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:13,930
Wait, what was this?

1648
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:14,350
No.

1649
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,070
No, this one works the best.

1650
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:16,370
Yeah.

1651
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:17,950
I'll keep this.

1652
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,090
That's gonna be my eyes.

1653
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:24,050
Uh, no, I like the blue more.

1654
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,870
No, I like this.

1655
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,910
Okay, what's the pilot?

1656
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:31,070
It has to be red.

1657
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:34,270
There we go.

1658
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:38,510
Yeah, and then... No, I like the cookie color.

1659
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:40,130
I think the cookie color is nice.
