1
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:48,750
hello hello welcome welcome today is a very special day
because it is i think almost like past the one year

2
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:58,270
anniversary but um it's like been a year since we last
played god of war and i figured it's the perfect time to

3
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:07,370
come back as the father with my milk and be like hello son i
am back now to make sure you're not still a fucking pussy uh

4
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,190
oh wait no he is Because we found out he was Loki.

5
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,110
So he's still going to be a goddamn pussy.

6
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,910
The day I discovered my son was a goddamn magic user.

7
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,090
I...

8
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,410
Oh, God.

9
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,630
Okay, I'm still sick, guys.

10
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,630
Back the boy.

11
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,410
I just remembered my revelation where I was like, no!

12
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,010
He's going to be the first twink!

13
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,250
No!

14
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,270
No!

15
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:59,790
world's first twink no i raised him when she yeah so a lot
of the first of a lot of things um so yeah so i i am back to

16
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:06,330
play god dad of war oh yeah and the first furry he was the
first he was a

17
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:21,490
um he truly was a pioneer a trendsetter um he walked so they
could run

18
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:36,630
anyway um i i am still sick unfortunately um i'm at the
phase where i start coughing which is the worst part because

19
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:45,770
like as you guys remember it is a tradition where um i have
the aftermath of the i mean i still have the cold i'm still

20
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:54,010
i'm still like i'm still blowing my nose and everything but
it comes with the you know um it comes with the fact that i

21
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:02,290
i could be coughing for maybe a couple of days or it could
last two to three months who knows it's a fucking gamble so

22
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:11,370
we'll see Because last night I didn't have a lot of I didn't
have a lot of good sleep today Because I was coughing myself

23
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:18,550
awake and then I woke up with like super dry throat because
I was coughing a lot So I think I only had around like three

24
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:26,610
to four hours to sleep overall just because I kept coughing
myself awake So let's hope let's hope my gamma luck is not

25
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,510
that bad

26
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,130
but it doesn't last a couple of months because I do have to
record some stuff this month.

27
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,850
So I'm just like praying to God.

28
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,570
I'm like, please, I have to every time.

29
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,870
Every time I'm like, I'm setting motion some things where I
have to record something, I get sick.

30
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,350
It happened for like the birthday concert.

31
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,250
It happened for like Phantom Thief.

32
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,130
It happened for like voice packs.

33
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,630
It's like I don't know fucking know why.

34
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,570
I'm like, oh, I've got to record something, um, on audacity.

35
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,850
And then I'm like, okay, I'm going to, I have to like make
sure I have everything set up.

36
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,730
And then the moment I'm like, I'm ready.

37
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,550
I get sick.

38
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,010
And it's, it's, it's like every time I have that thought, it
just comes in.

39
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,330
My body is like, no, we must stop you physically.

40
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,070
I'm actually cursed.

41
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,330
But yes, but at least not as cursed as God of war.

42
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,230
My most delayed series I've ever done.

43
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,230
Like something always happens for God of War.

44
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,070
It sucks that we didn't get played the first part like two
days ago.

45
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,170
But at least we're playing it.

46
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,590
Good thing I scheduled it twice.

47
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,770
So at least we get to play it this week.

48
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,210
Anyway, before we begin, we do have something very important
to do before we begin God of War.

49
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,290
I do remember what happened in the last game.

50
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,810
Because there is a hint that, what was it?

51
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:12,490
um someone is coming uh in the second game i assume it's
like it's thor right so we're gonna be meeting thor um and

52
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:20,770
uh i don't and that's all i know uh and then we found out
that my son is actually loki and um and i was like oh no oh

53
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:33,590
no he's gonna meet a oh no he's gonna meet a horse and i
can't stop it all i can do is let watch it happen No!

54
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,210
Boy!

55
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,470
He's gonna... He's gonna meet a horse.

56
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,190
Anyway, um...

57
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,370
It's just you cannot change... That's the worst part.

58
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,010
As the father, I cannot change destiny.

59
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,630
And I think that is the worst part.

60
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,930
Anyway, I have a very important thing to do before.

61
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:15,850
before we uh start today's stream uh because a very
important update came out today and i gotta go shopping i

62
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:25,990
gotta go shopping right now before i forget um give me a sec
guys this very this is absolutely important yes a very

63
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:32,670
important update came out i told you guys all right here we
go So if you guys didn't know, self-park, oh wait, also

64
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:39,290
reminder, the code does refresh if you don't use it after
like a certain amount of weeks.

65
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,270
So remember to type dokeybird and support a creator over
here.

66
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,030
And then it's time to spend money on cosmetics and then not
touch the game after.

67
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,310
Time to window shop.

68
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,690
Oh my God, look at 10,000.

69
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,350
Oh my, I'm going to...

70
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:09,110
i'm gonna be cartman he has cartman land i have dokey land
like we're practically okay i shouldn't say that but like i

71
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:17,670
i i will my i will not get tally because i think sponge bob
is better as the side it's so funny having a sponge running

72
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:25,170
around um i don't know if i should just buy cartman and then
because i just really oh but i could have kenny and kyle and

they have right now in the shop?

76
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:55,450
I heard like the repo guys are back I don't know, they're
back today or like another Another week Yes, also the reason

77
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:04,430
why I stream this whenever I buy stuff is so It's like it's
like a tax right off to um guys we have to game the system

78
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:14,290
it is like a business expense this is a this i'm streaming

And apparently, cred is coming out later, so I'm definitely
going to get cred, because we all need cred.

91
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,400
It's creepy with the chocolate.

92
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,520
Okay, how many?

93
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,020

95
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,160
Give me a sec, guys.

96
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,180
I like how, like, because, like, apparently Kazuna, I, okay,
I'm sorry about pronouncing her name wrong.

97
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:12,540
um i'm sorry i'm really bad pronunciation but she is get it
got leaked that she's getting a fortnight icon skin and

98
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,180
people were like freaking out because they're like oh my god
that means vtubers there's a chance for vtubers to get an

99
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:27,020
icon skin and then like the one of the famous one of the
biggest like uh twitter like fortnight leak uh twitter

100
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:34,000
accounts was like oh what other vtubers are you looking
forward to and then like he posted a picture of me in there

101
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,900
along with like three other people who are much more bigger
content creators than me and i was like whoa how like she

there and that's me i'm the clown i'm like oh i'm like yeah

105
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:17,240
i think because i'm the only one with a fortnite creator
code but i literally all i do is just window shop all i do

106
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:27,680
is literally i go on buy fortnite skins and then like and
then and then tap out that's all i do i i'm literally just a

107
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,560
collector i just can't help it Like, maybe, like, a game or
two.

108
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,940
They don't even know that.

109
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,320
They don't need, like, I would, I would, like, try the skins
out.

110
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,160
But I just, I'm just like, they're, honestly, I'm their
perfect customer.

111
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,300
I don't clog the servers and I'm just here to window, I'm
just here to shop.

112
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,560
Yeah, I'm the ideal customer.

113
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,760
I was being like, guys, pour it in.

114
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
I know I'm going to be Cartman.

115
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,320
I don't want to be Cartman.

116
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,200
Oh my God, wait, does he have, does he wear kicks?

117
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:10,780
oh my god guys you can make him work crocs oh my god wait
okay that's that's beautiful wait i did not know that oh

118
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:19,580
like okay wait okay he obviously has to have to give me the
toilet on the back um and then i am the perfect consumer for

119
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:27,520
them oh my god wait what does it look like when i'm on
shenron oh i can't see it i can't see karmann on shenron

120
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,240
guys but i can guys wait

121
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,030
Oh my god, you're styling right now.

122
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,830
Also, Cartman Land is also in Fortnite right now, which is
great.

123
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,230
I feel like they should have made it so that only Cartman
Skins can go into Cartman Land.

124
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,070
Because it would make sense unless this is like post Cartman
Land where he has to make money.

125
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,610
But I think it would have been...

126
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,230
Oh, and Canada exists too.

127
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,430
I mean, obviously.

128
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,230
Canada is real, guys.

129
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,890
Canada is real.

130
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,710
But like, they added Canada in Fortnite.

131
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,450
And I was like, oh my god.

132
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:17,470
I feel so represented right now No way no way I don't but
yes it's real guys Oh my god Carmen was SpongeBob oh guys

133
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,730

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,140
Stop.

143
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,900
Give me a sec, guys.

144
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,160

Can Master Chief, can, can Master Chief wear Crocs?

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,680
Guys, did you know when you buy V-Bucks, there's also a
creator code and I've not been using that.

147
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Fun fact.

148
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,800
When you buy Veefucks, you can also use my creator code and
I just found out about it after I don't know how much money

149
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,240
I've spent.

150
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,140
Okay.

151
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,620
Bite size.

Oh my god, he's so C-Slay right now.

212
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,660
He's, I gotta believe it.

213
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,780
All right, all right.

214
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:21,540
All right, now that I've made my very important purchase
today, um, oh my god, now that I made my very important

215
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,500
purchase, now we can, now that the main game is over, I
guess we can play, I guess we can start our side quest right

216
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:27,800
now.

217
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,520
Um, did I tell you guys I got the 6-7 E-Mode?

218
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,720
on Overwatch recently, like on Soldier 76.

219
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,180
I think that is like perfect marketing right there,
honestly.

220
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:52,140
So like the fact that Soldier 76 was technically born during
the time, like he basically grew up, he's Gen Alpha.

221
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,860
He's literally Gen Alpha slash Zumer.

222
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,620
And he grew up with six, seven.

223
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:08,140
and then he named himself soldier 76 it was perfect whoever
whoever whoever the dev was that came up with the concept

224
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:18,620
concept of soldier 76 he could see the future he was a
prophet he truly the guy who devout who create con like

225
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:29,320
conceptualized soldier 76 knew what was going to happen yeah
it's lower accurate it's actually lower accurate people were

226
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:37,100
like would never do that but he was actually he was
literally a gen gen alpha slash zoomer wait is it booting up

227
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:46,380
why the fuck where's god of war i did not sorry i should oh
there it is new controller firmware ignore please all right

228
00:22:47,750 --> 00:23:00,130
i'm trying to boot up guys don't worry it's running it's
synchronizing cloud it says it's running now it's it says

229
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:10,210
it's running oh oh the browser popped up oh progress is
being made we're starting our side quest now

230
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:25,930
oh okay uh we do not need a skip all right oh oh yeah i
bought the okay i'm so fucking stupid.

231
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:31,490
I bought the game the day after the Steam sale because I
forgot to buy Ragnar Ragnar.

232
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,370
I was like, oh, it's alright, I have the game already.

233
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,390
And then I, like, literally the day after the Steam sale, I
was like, wait, what is this said?

234
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,230
Why can't I find the copy of the game?

235
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,050
And it was January 6th when I discovered it.

236
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,170
Um, and then I paid $80.

237
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,610
Uh, boy, got a boy.

238
00:23:52,930 --> 00:24:05,970
The thing is, I um let's see common settings all right the
worst part is that i bought i like bought in advance all the

239
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,470
other games that was going to be playing the next two weeks
but for some but they were all like super cheap like you

240
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:18,490
know ten dollars fifteen dollars and of course the one game
the most expensive triple a title is the one that i forgot

241
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:32,890
to buy is speech size ui i don't know i feel blind I'm just
gonna put large actually that's fine defaults fine lock on

242
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:39,730
camera classic auto target unlocks my target dies or aiming
target make break also like because I've been blowing my

243
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:47,190
nose a lot which fucking sucks when it picks up health and
race rage stones when need I'm just gonna do essentials

244
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:55,190
picks up how loot drops went out of combat picks up full
okay I'm just gonna do essentials and then I'll in case i

245
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:06,110
need help uh actually no because then it if i don't need it
and then i'll waste the pickup yeah never mind uh no i feel

246
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:14,430
like because like sometimes you save the health and stuff so
like if you need like you know uh you know like uh you want

247
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,630
to save it for like another fight and or something and then
i don't want to pick it up if that happens allows for

248
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:30,550
additional traversal includes vaulting uh mantling jumping
gaps and includes vaulting climbs i like i'll do auto for

249
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:41,510
that it might be easier uh uh jumping gaps or okay i feel
yeah i'm gonna do auto for that oh whoops i'll do auto for

250
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:53,350
that should be good all right uh motion reduction with
motion reduce increases stability making play movement a

251
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:59,730
smooth and steady cinematic smoothing removes quick
movements and sharp jarring enables oh we can just get rid

252
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:14,950
of motion blur red later uh you're playing husband sim a
demo I feel like I'm playing father simulator more uh our

253
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:29,430
audio should be good yeah also sound guy are you around oh
there he goes sorry me also yeah like i said i was blowing

254
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:36,950
my i've been blowing my nose a lot so my ears have been like
what's the word popped a lot and not great especially right

255
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:57,360
now it's like clogged um okay no like this game came out a
while ago already oh i'm still compiling shaders oh we

256
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,380
should get a recap for sure all right aim assist oh my god
what's classic plus points to the aim reticle from anywhere

257
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:12,600
on screen points to closest target already relative point
okay okay puzzle aim assist from nearby when aiming puzzle

258
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:24,540
timing default lock in camera i'm so tempted guys i'm so
tempted to go classic plus i guys i'm not very good with

259
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:38,760
controller uh All right, auto pickup, minigame, tutorial
mode, pause on focus loss, reduced puzzle hit, weapon

260
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,620
sheafing, HUD.

261
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,380
Okay, none of these I need to worry about.

262
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,300
Okay, graphics and camera.

263
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,040
All right, this is what, oh yeah, that 500 hertz.

264
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,920
Yeah, that's right.

265
00:27:50,020 --> 00:28:00,940
Okay, let's just in case so my PC doesn't explode because I
have no idea how far this goes oh just 144 okay that's fine

266
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:11,280
latency frame gen quality medium i mean i'm fine maybe high
can't be that bad how about ultra okay let's go high i

267
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:19,180
shouldn't test my look i shouldn't all right let's grab the
motion blur down here um

268
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:31,470
camera shake i'm not a does not okay yeah okay does not
affect synonym sudden this usually occurs okay yeah we don't

269
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:40,470
okay ambient okay we we don't need camera shake right guys
like that's not gonna ruin your immersion because I

270
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:48,730
personally I I personally fucking hate camera shake so I'm I
hope that that doesn't ruin your immersion because I'm not a

271
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,140
fan of that shit all right

272
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:05,810
it's yeah i i don't think that i personally do not think
okay uh that camera shake matters let's give them color just

273
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:12,470
because wait it doesn't give them different no okay never

There's only one person alive who can get you, but you need

288
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,820
First, you need to cut off my head.

294
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,000
The god of Warstream is finally real.

295
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,340
I chose to live as a man.

296
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,440
But the truth is, I was born a god.

297

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,800
Wait, he tried to kill his mom.

306
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,960
My dear sweet boy.

307
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,030
Look, she was a giant.

308
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,310
I'm a giant.

309
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,650
I guess there's just one thing I don't understand.

310
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,350
The Giants called me, Loki?

311
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,490
That's when I knew.

312
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,350
I see the future of my boy.

313
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:46,270
I see the future of my boy, and I can't stop it.

314
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,910
I can't stop the outcome.

315
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,730
That's the worst part.

316
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,910
I can't stop it.

317
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:53,770
I...

318
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,010
That's so...

319
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,110
All right.

320
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:09,930
is sound guy alive because I didn't hear him say anything
and that's what I'm worried about is sound guy alive right

321
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,830
now what's this

322
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:25,080
alright hello sound guy what did you think about the audio
before we go in because we can do this right now with the

323
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,840
recap I think recap was a good balance

324
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:41,380
here is the audio settings for you we just get it off right
off the bat recap was very low okay i upped it up a lot more

325
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:52,780
now all right let's go in new game give me a story give me
grace give me balance all right we could do balance yeah we

326
00:33:52,780 --> 00:34:00,420

game and not really fps so i i can't tell

327
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,170
God of war.

328
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,650
That guy knows what's up.

329
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,960
Yeah, I'm definitely going to get the blur off.

330
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,440
I didn't think we actually need the blur or the subtitles.

331
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,780
Just keep throwing your axe.

332
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,860
Yeah, but then remember a lot of people got mad at me for
just using my axe.

333
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:42,660
They're like, Kratos has like a million combos, and yet all
you're doing is throwing your axe, and I'm like, axe go,

334
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,020
I think I rage baited too many people.

335
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,220
I literally made a fighting game of an FPS.

336
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,760
Where's my son?

337
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,960

Boy, come back here!

340
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,260
Do not interact with the wildlife!

341
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,240
No!

342
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,440
Oh, God, it's dead.

343
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:13,920
Thank God.

Oh my god, he hit puberty!

348
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,770
He was just hunting, guys.

349
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,890
Boy was just hunting.

350
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,470
He has yet to discover his furry side.

351
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,540
Like, my home?

352
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,700
This home is getting worse.

353
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,340
Are we going back to our gods?

354
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,920
Or still in the Norse realm?

355
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,170
Oh my god.

356
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,050

He's in puberty.

360
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,530
He's growing hair now.

361
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,610
That's not just on his head.

362
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,300
Game is still real low.

363
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,180
Okay, don't worry.

364
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,020

game.

474
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,210
Oh

475
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,630
no, it's raining.

476
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,450
What a bad day for rain.

477
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:27,820
Come.

478
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,440
We train.

479
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,340
What?

480
00:48:34,500 --> 00:49:00,420

482
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:22,920

time is running out the prophecy say fimbal winter leads to

483
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:32,440
ragnarok war is coming whatever loki's supposed to be doing

484
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:41,460

485
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:41,820
doing?

486
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,220
I know, right, Arteus?

487
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,100
Fuck that guy.

488
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,420
And if those answers lead to war with Asgard.

489
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,300
Maybe that's what Mother wanted.

490
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,620
You do not know what Mother wanted.

491
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,800
Looks like we never will.

492
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,200
Does he know?

493
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,660
If only we knew where Loki is.

494
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,780
Oh, yeah, I'll up the voices a little bit more.

495
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,240
I just want to...

496
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:12,780
Oh, shit.

497
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,320
Oh, sorry.

498
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,660
This was why I didn't want to up it yet.

499
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,140
But I'll...

500
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,340
Look.

501
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,800
I have a moment alone with Fenrir before I bury him.

502
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,440
Oh.

503
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,730
I'm so sad.

504
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,930
Are we going to tell the other kids?

505
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,880
Like, the other...

506
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:55,620
other kids you know that the other dogs did it's okay all
dogs go to heaven i don't know in nor if they do in norse

507
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:04,960
mythology but like i assume they also go to vahala all dogs
go to vahala right right

508
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:15,940
well i don't recognize that dull expression anywhere what
went wrong

509
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:42,520
he was in the fight the dog was in the fight with his own
body that's the fight his blood cells were these white blood

510
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,060
cells were fighting technically it

511
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,060
was an old age it was sick

512
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:40,090
what the fuck who the fuck is it what the fuck that's creepy
it was like what lady touched me

513
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,640
my inner demons my sleep paralysis demon

514
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,160
Freya.

515
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,040
Oh, is she invading my dreams?

516
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,660
Oh my god, it's like, woman!

517
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,680
Are you joining me?

518
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,860
What the fuck am I having dreams, like, hot, sexy dreams
about the woman that's trying to kill me?

519
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,240
Oh, it's Faye, not Freya.

520
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,580
Sorry, I'm very bad at you.

521
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Oh, it's the giant.

522
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,240
It's the giant woman.

523
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,620
The emir himself sits atop your shoulders.

524
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,080
Okay.

525
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,820
She's your aunt.

526
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,640
Wait, she's not as...

527
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:26,900
Wait.

528
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,340
She's not a giant.

529
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,760
Wait, did she shrink her?

530
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,620
Oh, yeah, I forgot the Norse giants can shrink themselves.

531
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,180
No, no, come on.

532
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,000
That's not fun.

533
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,460
Come on.

534
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,180
Kratos is freaky.

535
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,380
Am I to decipher your grunting?

536
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,220
Tell me your thoughts.

537
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,360
We hunt a predator.

538
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,160
A wolf.

539
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:45,980
Yes.

540
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,000
Predators kill.

541
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,780
It is the natural order of things.

542
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,700
Your words are misguided.

543
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,780
Oh, for this one, they don't know how to turn big.

544
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,780
for the in-the-game.

545
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,640
Because usually in Norse mythology...

546
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,020
Oh, hey.

547
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:01,960
We want to help.

548
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,660
Oh, is this Fenyer?

549
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,100
Oh!

550
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:07,660
Don't!

551
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,920
Come on.

552
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,640
Like, in the regular Norse mythology, the giants can grow
big or small.

553
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,260
I know, like, Loki was abandoned because he was too small.

554
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,760
Like, in the original.

555
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,880
It was not our concern.

556
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:23,880
Now it is.

557
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:28,790
Oh.

558
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:37,050
doesn't have to reach our doorstep for it to be our
responsibility if we have the power to limit the harm it

559
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:44,870
could cause we should act who are we to hide and do nothing
we are not hiding

560
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:57,030
oh that's a marvel rival sort okay i like mixed them up they
blur together for me now sometimes miss mix up the mark

561
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:03,930
because i was like i would read about low Loki in rivals,
sorry, in Marvel lore, and I would read about regular Loki

562
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,030
lore, and then it all blurted it together.

563
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:12,170
I cannot differentiate between Marvel Norse mythology and
regular Norse mythology now.

564
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:13,850
I was like, what is that?

565
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,550
Is that square?

566
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:20,070
I... Which

567
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,560
one is the weird one?

568
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,500
Obviously, the OG one.

569
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,600
The fact that, like, his dad, after he gave...

570
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:42,760
birth to a horse his dad was like this is my horse now
that's all right is yeah odin was like all right i shall now

571
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:55,840
use your son as my as my horse it hovered toward and
automatically one or press oh wait oh the ledge i thought i

572
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,900
was climbing the log this way very

573
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:09,070
Odin is not his dad, but yes, look, that's why I'm saying it
blurred together for me.

574
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:09,870
It mixed together.

575
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:14,690
Because when I was growing up, I love reading about
different mythologies from around the world.

576
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,870
So I was, like, super into that.

577
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:18,170
Oh.

578
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,270
Where did you grab the yellow paint?

579
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:31,690
And then, like, and then I read about, like, the Marvel
lore, like, Marvel mythologies and stuff, and then it

580
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,510
blurred together.

581
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,580
Where's Atreus?

582
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,180
Hence my bellowing.

583
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,660
There's yellow paint on his head.

584
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,000
We can climb it now and support it.

585
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,580
It cannot be far.

586
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,500
All right.

587
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,780
What if they wanted to warn me?

588
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,320
Where's the dog?

589
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,760
Hey, I want to go back.

590
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,420
Journal unlocked.

591
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,400
Oh, okay.

592
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,440
Is this?

593
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,040
No?

594
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,540
We're unlocking the journal.

595
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,580
Oh, it's the review objectives.

596
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,540
I'm gonna go back.

597
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,520
I'm gonna go back.

598
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,060
That's most likely where he did the burying.

599
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,020
Where's the dog?

600
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,880
Far's dwindling now.

601
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:32,720
Hello.

602
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,300
Where else could he have gone from here?

603
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,260
Hello.

604
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,500
Your brother is dead.

605
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,640
I'm sorry.

606
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,060
Also, I upped the volume a bit more.

607
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,020
Sound guy.

608
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,940
Let me know if it's better.

609
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,200
Yeah, I've had a feeling.

610
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,140
Bam.

611
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:50,900
Bam.

612
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,140
Bam.

613
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,100
You seem troubled in your sleep.

614
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,280
Even for you.

615

00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,620

00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:54,520
Bam!

651
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,860
Whoa, oh, never mind.

652
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,580
I thought I was...

653
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,000
that strong, I guess.

654
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,440
Okay, like, cutting it in half would have also worked, too.

655
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:03,840
Oh, yeah, nice.

656
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,180
Well, you were right.

657
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,800
The state is broken.

658
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,860
Explains our trespassers.

659
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,300
What happened here?

660
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:10,980
Oh, wait.

661
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,360
Where did they break it?

662
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,600
Was it on...

663
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,780
Oh, my God.

664
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,460
What did they do to the poor bear?

665
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,300
Hello?

666
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:20,900
Are you okay?

667
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,160
Do you need help?

668
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:22,900
The bear.

669
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:23,420
Mold.

670
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,440
By what?

671
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,460
Do you think it's dead?

672
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:26,460
Oh, shit.

673
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:34,540
larger bear the fight destroyed the tree oh i between the
savage beasts and marauding radars he may have sought

674
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:45,480
shelter follow the trail oh no that's the worst part when
you die from a bigger version of you left or right right

675
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:55,360
here okay that's where the blood stain is the left side is
the fun side never mind it goes the same way which means

676
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,500
this might Oh, never mind.

677
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,040
My gaming intuition led me to nothing.

678
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,740
All right, let's see.

679
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,360
Oh, yeah, nice.

680
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,220
I knew there was something here.

681
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,560
The boy is alone with an animal.

682
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:13,860
Yay!

683
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,300
I'm glad I still punched chess.

684
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,040
Wait, can I?

685
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:19,900
All right.

686
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,700
Is there a Doki and Doki verse that's just bigger than the
rest?

687
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,460
Thank you for the super chat, Alan.

688
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:38,380
you think oh my god this is it it's fbs tap oh where's my
axe hi there you go any idea what could have made the lad

689
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:51,480
wonder off we argued he accuses me of hiding from odin yeah
only sensible to accuse me of being a pussy how dare he that

690
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:58,440
is why atreus must learn to survive on his own that I'm a
goddamn pussy.

691
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:03,360
Guess because the giants had you dead on some wall full of
otherwise accurate predictions.

692
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,360
I do not believe in prophecies.

693
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:06,620
Well...

694
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,260
I knew it.

695
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,600
I was like, I see blood here, which means...

696
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:10,600
Wait.

697
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,200
Maybe?

698
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,220
We can't get across there from here.

699
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,520
Okay.

700
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,960
Alright, fine.

701
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,540
I don't know, I just thought it would work somehow.

702
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,700
What the fuck?

703
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,580
Why are so many entrances for no reason?

704
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:36,380
reason let's find him all right yoink he's dead so it's not
robbing i'm just making sure nothing is wasted okay nice

705
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:49,020
like remember lat when remember when doki didn't believe in
prophecies and how well did that turn out for her all right

706
01:02:49,020 --> 01:03:01,120
there we go surely surely our loki is down here right I'm
skeptical by nature, though we have seen things that defy

707
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,800
explanation.

708
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,460
So, speaking as the smartest man alive, I have no bloody
idea.

709
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,620
But, well, to frost up the axe, powering up the necks.

710
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,920
Oh, FPS time.

711
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:17,420
Whoa!

712
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,140
Yeah!

713
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,460
Look, okay, I'll start fighting when they get closer to me.

714
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,460
But, look, I'm...

715
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,580
They're not close.

716
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:38,140
see look at that look at that when they get closer then i'll
use my other attacks but because they have yet to reach me

717
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:50,060
then i have justification to use it when you want me to run
up to them oh shit oh shit okay okay now see look at that

718
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:55,960
see they got closer look okay it does the same amount of
damage when I shoot my axe.

719
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,200
Like, come on.

720
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,300
Like, come on.

721
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,660
I feel like at that point, if I am closer, I should be able
to do more damage with my melee.

722
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,240
That's my FPS VTuber.

723
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,240
All I'm saying is that why?

724
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,220
Okay, wait.

725
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:15,820
Let's see.

726
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,460
Alright, see, look.

727
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:19,800
Boom!

728
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,240
What the fuck?

729
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:23,740
That's right.

730
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,640
Get shot!

731
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,380
That's fine.

732
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,000
There we go.

733
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,640
Yeah, switching to your axes faster than reloading to
your...

734
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,620
Oh wait, that's true.

735
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,200
Hey guys, like that combo?

736
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,760
I don't even know what I did.

737
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,400
Just in case.

738
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,420
I'm pre-firing.

739
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,140
What did I do there?

740
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,560
Like...

741
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,500
Wait, is he...

742
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,540
Oh shit!

743
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,980
There we go.

744
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,300
Where's the other guy?

745
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh there he is.

746
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:13,840
Oh shit!

747
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:14,620
Okay there we go.

748
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,680
That's fucking right!

749
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,020
BAM!

750
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,020
Draw my combos!

751
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,320
Guys, that's funny that you mentioned, Barry.

752
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,940
That's so funny.

753
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,480
I know what you're thinking, brother.

754
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,780
But Atreus can handle himself.

755
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,580
Don't worry, he's a man now.

756
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,460
So he keeps telling me.

757
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,580
I believe in him.

758
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,520
His voice dropped.

759
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,780
His balls literally dropped.

760
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,200
Alright.

761
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,380
Yeah, it's okay.

762
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:50,960
They're raiders.

763
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,640
So, like, they're grazed me nothing to me.

764
01:05:54,040 --> 01:06:00,080
So technically, I'm justified to Since they're raiders, I'm
justified to rave the graves.

765
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,520
I'm sure we can find a quiet way in.

766
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,140
Wild way.

767
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:05,960
What's that?

768
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,500
I don't know what quiet is.

769
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,020
Oh, you can do that.

770
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,760
Yeah, free stuff.

771
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,800
We rather fight a dokey-sized bird or a 50-bird-sized dokey.

772
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,240
Thank you for the super chat, Turner.

773
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,100
Thank you, thank you.

774
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,940
He's the leaders you rescued the wolves from.

775
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,060
They have not been here long.

776
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,230
You think they'll notice?

777
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:41,050
Now we're fired.

778
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:43,770
Loot is loot.

779
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:47,940
Alright.

780
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,460
Death from above.

781
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,440
Oh, shit.

782
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,160
Wait, that's cool.

783
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:52,960
What?

784
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:54,480
Oh.

785
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:57,580
What?

786
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,120
Okay, there you go.

787
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,020
Second time's the charge.

788
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,840
He didn't notice.

789
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,620
He didn't notice my war cry.

790
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,100
Thank God.

791
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:17,370
thank i'm glad i'm glad they didn't hear my war cry thank
god it worked what oh there it is

okay he was actually deaf thank god thank god that guy was

793
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,290
deaf and my All right.

794
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,370
Okay, let's grab his stuff.

795
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:43,750
Yoink.

796
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,430
Oh, Jakarta.

797
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:47,530
Thank you for the super chat.

798
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:47,850
Thank you.

799
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:48,510
Thank you.

800
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:51,250
I mean, okay, I'm greedy.

801
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,330
I don't care.

802
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:55,370
I'm full HP if I'll still take it.

803
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,710
Boy, is there anything else I can destroy here?

804
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,370
Might be extra loot.

805
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,210
This is what Zelda taught me.

806
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,430
I've never played a Zelda game in my life.

807
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,910
But I know that we always have to smash.

808
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:10,410
everything you see.

809
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:14,350
Now that's what we call what we all been waiting for.

810
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,850
FPS gamer, dogeeper, don't change.

811
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:20,350
It's what Dragon's One.

812
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:23,650
Between Batman and God War, we love projectiles.

813
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,730
Thank you for the super chat, Takata.

814
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:26,270
Thank you.

815
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:26,770
Thank you.

816
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:28,930
Where is he?

817
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:32,750
Where?

818
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,390
I hear noises.

819
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:37,690
Oh, there they are.

820
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:38,450
It's okay.

821
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:46,910
all right when they get closer you guys know what's gonna
happen there we go

822
01:08:50,770 --> 01:09:04,390
all right it's fine oh what the oh my god i forgot about the
file girl where is she oh there she is oh wait what there we

823
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:08,910
go that's right i could do that too that's right

824
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,570
That's fucking right.

825
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,050
That's why you don't fully invest in archery.

826
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,770
In range.

827
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,070
You gotta diversify.

828
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,530
Yeah, but art one is fast.

829
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:28,530
You gotta learn to do both.

830
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:33,630
I get over there.

831
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:34,490
Oh, there.

832
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,090
That's how.

833
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:37,570
Yay!

834
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:41,170
Grave-robbing, my favorite part of this game.

835
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:43,930
It's okay.

836
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:48,830
I killed everyone around me, so is it truly grave-robbing if
no one can see?

837
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:51,510
Boom!

838
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:53,670
That's right.

839
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:55,690
That's right.

840
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,990
Why are you hitting yourself?

841
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,190
Why are you hitting yourself?

842
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:04,370
Okay, I can do the sprint thing, but I don't need to.

843
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:07,690
Bad.

844
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:21,510
but why the fuck are you not climbing is there someone i'm
missing oh oh whoops oh look i couldn't i didn't know they

845
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:30,070
were they were just these ladies were just standing there i
guess they were waiting for their turn are you here how is

846
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:37,450

benefits let's find a way perhaps a cheus came here seeking

847
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:45,770
shelter saw the raiders and the bear came battling after
impressive rampage i'll give it that you think the bear was

848
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:52,570
chasing atreus well just as likely the bear was hurt and
atreus was chasing it to help how does he help chasing it oh

849
01:10:52,570 --> 01:11:04,310
i guess to eat the dog i guess it's like free food all right
but but the sound is okay now right guys yeah kratos just

850
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:11,190
likes to make the ladies wait for their turn so polite what
Oh my god, the bigger bear!

851
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,270
Well, it's not even like a special bear.

852
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,310
The bear's just bigger.

853
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,730
Oh shit, a circle, circle, a square button.

854
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:24,110
Oh my god, it's okay.

855
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:27,190
Oh my god, it's worn!

856
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:28,710
Okay.

01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:32,850
Oh my god.

858
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:37,230
Isn't that like... Oh shit, I did not mean to do that.

859
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:38,910
Wait, isn't that like...

01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:40,870
PewDiePie's son's name?

Oh, my God.

Okay.

01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:21,800
It's fine.

911
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,980
I'm just gonna start blocking.

912
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:28,900
Jesus.

913
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,100
Jesus Christ.

914
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,420
Oh.

01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:40,810
Okay.

01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,190
Okay, it's fine.

918
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,890
Oh, it's no longer five!

919
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,470
It's no longer five!

920
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:55,050
Oh, God.

921
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:56,150
Oh, God.

922
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:58,070
He's beating me the fuck up, guys.

923
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:01,070
I swear to God.

924
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:02,690
Slap!

925
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:03,210
Slap!

926
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,250
Slap!

927
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:05,450
Slap the bear!

928
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:07,590
Oh, God.

929
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:08,210
A fucking course.

930
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:08,830
No!

931
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:12,170
Woo!

932
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:13,150
No!

933
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:13,910
I tried.

934
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,530
I tried to get the fucking greed.

935
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:19,940
Ah!

936
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,300
Okay, I'm locked in.

937
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:35,100
now that i know oh my god thank god free hits gotta beat up
the bear all right i'm slowly figuring it out it's okay

01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:50,450

Are you fucking kidding me?

941
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:58,790
Okay.

942
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:00,590
There we go.

943
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:01,150
That's five.

944
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,870
I figured it out.

945
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,130
I figured out how to do it.

946
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,110
There we go.

947
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:08,690
I told you.

948
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:09,190
Oh my god.

949
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:09,710
What?

950
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,590
What?

951
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,030
Okay.

952
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,130
That's fucking bullshit.

953
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:14,830
I parried like twice there.

954
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,270
Get out of here.

955
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:17,830
Get out of here.

956
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,210
I told you I locked in.

957
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,050
I'm like an AI.

958
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:27,390
I learned.

959
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,510
I learned from it.

960
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,090
I'm literally AI.

961
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,800
There you go.

962
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,340
Snap that neck!

963
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,040
That's right!

964
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,300
What the fuck?

965
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:55,620
Wait.

966
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,280
Oh, Artyus?

967
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,840
Wait, Artyus?

968
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,120
What?

969
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,420
What happened?

970
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:07,660
Boy?

971
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,660
Oh my god, is this what puberty is?

972
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,460
Like men?

973
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,720
Oh shit, oh shit.

974
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:24,150
Don't you hate it when you started puberty and just turned
into a giant fucking bear?

975
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:30,930
I prayed Fenrir.

976
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,230
And then I'm not sure.

977
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:39,290
I was so sad.

978
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,970
Oh, his first, first suit.

979
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:43,290
And then I was angry

980
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:48,230
and scared.

981
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,870
And I remember running.

982
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,090
Sandy, thank you.

983
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:56,970
Sandy, Alan, thank you for the super chat.

984
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:57,810
Thank you.

985
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:04,450
Charging and I charged back.

986
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:04,910
Oh.

987
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,300
That had to be a dream.

988
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,900
Oh, I beat up my own son.

989
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,940
Don't kill our child protective surfaces.

990
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:22,650
I- I didn't know I could do that.

991
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:23,960
Oh.

992
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,640
You did not do anything.

993
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,960
Wasn't you.

994
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,260
They overcame you.

995
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,020
Well, puberty is hard, man.

996
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,940
That's why we must not abandon your training.

997
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,220
You will be dangerous without discipline to control.

998
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:50,900
show them you've already taught me discipline i need more
than that i need answers answers you don't have answers only

999
01:18:50,900 --> 01:19:01,200
your mother had that's how she withheld yeah it's your
mother's fault she just had to die someone that could give

1000
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:06,320
us answers about the giants and who loki's supposed to be so
selfish wouldn't it help to understand what i'm becoming

1001
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,420
betrayers listen to

1002
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,030
Yeah, don't blame me.

1003
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:27,250
Blame your dead mom.

1004
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:28,970
Inaction is also a risk.

1005
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:31,470
You taught me that.

1006
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:35,470
Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking
like a general.

1007
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:35,790
No!

1008
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,920
I'm not only...

1009
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,100
Well, they're not my only child, but like, the other ones
are dead.

1010
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,520
But I'm the only one that's alive.

1011
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,020

01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,580

i'm i'm just stating the fat oh my god he's a teenager bro

1019
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:51,500
that's the scale oh my gosh i was a teenager and now this is
what i'm worried about kids because teenagers are like the

1020
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:55,320
worst kind to like the worst phase of a child

1021
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:08,840
New square to command a can't come at come at because I knew
I was a shitty teenager

1022
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:21,760
Use command a command and attack arrow deals extra damage to
oh wait that's what square is for there you go oh wait I

1023
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:38,280

this and then I week okay and then my turn okay boom there

1024
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:46,880
you go and then oh wait he's dead dead all right nice so lad
besides your gift of language and healing creatures thoughts

1025
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:55,380
are there any other new magical abilities to report not
really what to finrier what about him when he died you cast

1026
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,740
a spell Oh, it's the blue light.

1027
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

1028
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:01,840
Hmm.

1029
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,200
Check your fumble winter, perhaps.

1030
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:05,660
Seen my share.

1031
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,250
Like I was like, don't worry.

1032
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:22,150
I was a good teenager, but only in the 20s where my
rebellious phase started.

1033
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:28,290
I think that's worse because when you're at 20, then you're
legally allowed to drink and also like drink and also drive,

1034
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:29,930
but not, don't do that at the same time, obviously.

1035
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:30,710
Don't drink and drive.

1036
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:35,210
But I think that's worse because you're more of an adult
having your rebellious phase.

1037
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:38,250
So you are a slow cooker.

1038
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,230
You are a slow burn.

1039
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:44,010
What a freak.

1040
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:44,970
Thank you for the super chat.

1041
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:45,290
Thank you.

1042
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:45,750
Thank you.

1043
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:46,770
What if the kid started?

1044
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:47,630
Oh, my God.

1045
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:55,670
You're like, boy, stop this six, seven at once, boy.

1046
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,730
That or any prey you might have been dragging, I suppose.

1047
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:03,090
Not sure that makes me feel any better.

1048
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:08,230
All right.

1049
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:09,210
We go home now.

1050
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,070
artists.

1051
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:10,990
Low-key.

1052
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,310
I'm just gonna call it a low-key.

1053
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:15,730
Less syllables.

1054
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:22,700
This one.

1055
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,880
He's doing the magic.

1056
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,150
Oh.

1057
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:58,030
What's that?

1058
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:59,490
No!

1059
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,360
You killed the mom!

1060
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:10,000
Why are there so many dead animals in this game?

1061
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:28,440

take them no no we should take them we should adopt them

Did not listen to his dad throughout it and then now was
like, you're right.

1073
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,040
You're right.

1074
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,640
Let nature take his course.

1075
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,960
It's like after everything.

1076
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:32,580
I should be allowed to adopt a bear it's been like this all

1084
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,580

Becky, you okay?

1087
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,400
Just a little thunder.

01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,900
See, look at him!

1089
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,400
He's so good with animals!

1090
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,130
Oh, it's the god of thunder.

1091
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:41,470
He's here.

1092
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:45,050
That's why it's thundering.

1093
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:46,230
Atreus!

1094
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:49,690
It's bedtime.

1095
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:51,670
It's past your bedtime boy.

1096
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,900
As evenings go, that was entirely too eventful.

1097
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,740
Though I admit it was a bit like old times there.

1098
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:03,500
For a moment.

1099
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:07,840
The three of us navigating some hitherto unhappened upon
patch of forest.

1100
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,540
Been a while since you've joined us.

1101
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,240
If that's what you mean.

1102
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,660
Well, just tired, I suppose.

1103
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,260
You've seen one deer hunt, you've seen them all.

1104
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:18,620
How can you feel tired when you never sleep?

1105
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:21,340
lad.

1106
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,360
You'll see when you're all done.

1107
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:30,640
There's bedtime.

1108
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,040
Come.

1109
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:31,520
Oh, wait.

1110
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,380
Oh, wait.

1111
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,200
We share a bed?

1112
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:34,740
Oh, my gosh.

1113
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,020
Oh, that's awkward.

1114
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:38,280
We don't have two separate beds?

1115
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,660
What happened to personal space?

1116
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,480
Things are always brighter than the morning.

1117
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,080
Oh, okay.

1118
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,080
We do have separate beds.

1119
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:46,880
Okay, thank God.

1120
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:48,860
I saw two pillows and I got a little worried.

1121
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,600
Alright, I did not see the third bed.

1122
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,980
I was like, there's two pillows here.

1123
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,140
Oh, I guess the other pillow is for my dead wife.

1124
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:00,660
So I can't...

1125
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,460
I told you, I don't move on.

1126
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,360
Oh, Tor's coming.

1127
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:10,640
Here's Thor!

1128
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,060
Here's the big boy.

1129
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:40,500
Before time, slap, slap that bully from my belly.

1130
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,040
I have meat.

1131
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,160
You would not find me good company.

1132
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:53,020
Oh, I'm sure we'll find lots to talk about.

1133
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,740
Oh my god, you're right.

1134
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,480
He's a bear.

1135
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:00,810
Yeah, I killed your brother.

1136
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,510
Wait, he has meat.

1137
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:07,790
him in.

1138
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,900
Medi, thank you for the super chat.

1139
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:21,200
Thank you.

1140
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:21,840
Thank you.

1141
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,820
Wait, Balder is his son?

1142
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:29,240
Oh, no.

1143
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:29,640
Oh, wait.

1144
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,620
Oh, the other two.

1145
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,540
Oh, yeah.

1146
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,980
I forgot about those two sons.

1147
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:36,240
No, Balder is his brother.

1148
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:37,380
How's that?

1149
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,060
Yeah, I forgot about the other two guys.

1150
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:44,080
They were so irrelevant.

1151
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:53,160
Sorry, sons nearly like were so irrelevant that i've already
forgot about them until now oh my god odin's here the

1158
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:05,640
just oh there's papa i was like i know father I shall ask
him.

1159
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,460
You seem like a calm and reasonable person.

1160
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,660
Calm and reasonable person.

1161
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:21,600
If the moment calls for...

1162
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,700
I never had me before.

1163
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,100
I know it's just alcohol.

1164
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,580
I'd say the moment calls for calm.

1165
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:29,260
It's okay.

1166
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:30,880
You can make more suns, Thor.

1167
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,920
Yeah, he's talking to the wrong person.

1168
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,760
if he wants calm and reasonable.

1169
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:53,230
Oh, oh, Papa!

1170
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:55,530
There's his dad.

1171
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:02,300
Oh my God, he has his dad to fight.

1172
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,200
Like, bro, he brought his dad?

1173
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,240
He's such a fucking pussy.

1174
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,800
You have to bring your dad to the war to the fight.

1175
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,440
The all-father.

1176
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,460
But I think we all have a better idea of who we're dealing
with.

1177
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,040
Now, what you did to his boys?

1178
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,140
Self-defense.

1179
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,080
True.

1180
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:30,560
And let's be honest, they were kind of...

1181
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,060
I know!

1182
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,660
You raised up some spoiled brats.

1183
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,100
He had value.

1184
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:39,460
He was...

1185
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:40,200
Dad counsel.

1186
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:41,800
My closer.

1187
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,560
Yeah, his mind was gone, sure.

1188
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,160
But he had his uses, and now he's gone because of you.

1189
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,060
Follow me.

1190
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,340
Why is Odin talk like a fucking mafia boss?

1191
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,100
Kabish, kabish.

1192
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:59,540
Like, I feel like he's, like, in the wrong fucking region.

1193
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,080
You're no fun anymore.

1194
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,800
What do you want?

1195
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,160
Yeah, he's talking like he's from the mob.

1196
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:16,340
How about peace?

1197
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:25,590
How does peace strike the esteemed retired God of war?

1198
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:37,070

Wait, is this...

1207
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:58,530
He had, like, a slight Scottish accent a little.

1208
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:00,490
Is he American accent, too?

1209
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:08,050
To be fair, he did not say a lot of words.

1210
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:16,560
Capiche?

1211
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,720
Oh!

1212
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:21,940
Ah!

1213
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:29,300
No.

1214
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,310
I guess the battle then.

1215
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:36,450
No more peace.

1216
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:37,750
All right.

1217
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:40,530
About time.

1218
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:45,990
Oh god, mi amor!

1219
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:48,270
I've been waiting for this.

1220
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,190
You're not from here.

1221
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:53,070
We got a tradition called blood payments.

1222
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:57,970
It means I get a piece of you for what you took from my
family.

1223
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:59,710
You'll pick it up.

1224
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,630
Oh shit!

1225
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,750
Thanks for explaining, I guess.

1226
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:13,710
I got a little confused.

1227
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:17,170
Oh, God.

1228
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:19,230
Oh, God.

1229
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:22,450
Wait, where's my axe?

1230
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,010
Wait, I don't have an axe?

1231
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:29,810
Oh, God.

1232
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:32,410
I know I should.

1233
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:33,350
What?

1234
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:35,930
I don't care.

1235
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:36,750
Oh, God.

1236
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:37,270
Oh, my God.

1237
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:38,030
He almost grabbed me.

1238
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:40,350
All right.

1239
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:40,930
I blocked.

1240
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:45,890
I need to figure out the timing for the fucking yellow.

1241
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:49,570
Because I know that that would be very helpful.

1242
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:52,830
Oh, nice!

1243
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:53,830
That's red!

1244
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,890
Bam!

1245
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:00,130
You know my task?

1246
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:02,150
The ghost of Sparta thing.

1247
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:03,210
Yeah.

1248
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:04,030
Am I calling it?

1249
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:05,030
Where is my axe?

1250
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:07,910
Oh, there it is.

1251
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:09,770
Yeah!

1252
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,430
That's fucking right.

1253
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,430
Now we got us a fight.

1254
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:17,170
What?

1255
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:23,150
I was hoping to see your blade.

1256
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:26,330
Okay, I have to do that, I guess.

1257
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:28,770
Okay, nice, he didn't grab me.

1258
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:32,350
All right, get dodged.

1259
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:36,430
Okay, there you go.

1260
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,150
Get parried!

1261
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,330
Oh shit, oh shit.

1262
01:38:39,470 --> 01:38:41,250
Okay, that is impossible.

1263
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,050
Okay.

1264
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,790
That shit is fucking impal- That's right.

1265
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:51,590
Fuck you.

1266
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:53,210
Boom!

1267
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:56,650
That's right, get fisted!

1268
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:58,730
Bam!

1269
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:01,030
That's right!

1270
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:04,150
Dude, I know you feel pain!

1271
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,030
Ooh, oh, your son.

1272
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:13,510

1276
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:46,210
Jesus Christ.

1277
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:47,930
I have the time.

1278
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:48,550
Oh, no.

1279
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:49,630
He actually grabbed me.

1280
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:50,730
Oh, fuck.

1281
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:52,490
I did not expect that.

1282
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:55,110
Bro, okay.

1283
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,410
This shit is bullshit.

1284
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:00,970
I'm just going to slap him with this and then grab that.

1285
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:04,230
Oh my god.

1286
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:05,850
What the fuck is this timing?

1287
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:07,070
I'll grab this too.

1288
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:09,090
And then slap you with this as well.

1289
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:10,210
Fuck it.

1290
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:12,570
If I just keep grabbing.

1291
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:14,750
Was it luck?

1292
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:15,350
Oh, no.

1293
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:20,250
Yo, your sons were like stupid, okay?

1294
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:21,830
Your sons were weak as hell.

1295
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,930
They were spoiled.

1296
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:27,330
You know, they were only gods because of nepotism.

1297
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:34,090
You're a destroyer like me.

1298
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,260
All right, what?

1299
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,760

Okay, now I know that.

1303
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:23,470
Okay, now I know that.

1304
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,500
Okay, there you go.

1305
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,960
Are you serious?

1306
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:33,980
Oh my god.

1307
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:34,920
What?

1308
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:37,860
I'm so bad at dodging this.

1309
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,260
I'm so bad at dodging this.

1310
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,820
Oh, I will admit I'm not very good at dodging those moves.

1311
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,040
Like, I could dodge the grabs.

1312
01:41:49,180 --> 01:42:02,780
Those are very predictable but oh my god okay but the other
ones are so hard to tag like that oh i keep doing it too

1313
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:11,960
early i keep doing it way too early and it fucking pisses me
off okay that's fine i got him a chokehold

1314
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,620
it's okay Bro,

1315
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:27,320
he's so good with the hammer.

1316
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:29,640
Bro, he's so good with the hammer.

1317
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:32,740
You put him last, even in death.

1318
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,120
The fuck you say?

1319
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,840
The fuck you say?

1320
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,500
Suck you say it, mommy?

1321
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:42,160
Oh, we got a model father here.

1322
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:43,700
That's...

1323
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,240
His generational trauma, to be fair.

1324
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:50,040
His dad was bringing fucking shit towards him.

1325
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:51,780
But, don't matter.

1326
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,040
How does he get full HP?

1327
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,320
And then...

1328
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,840
Okay, that's not fair.

1329
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,880
I still can't time that shit.

1330
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,540
Okay, I timed that, though.

1331
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:05,020
Okay, I needed...

1332
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,080
Okay.

1333
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:08,120
What?

1334
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,160
Stupid fucking...

1335
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,320
Okay, I timed it.

1336
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,460
Oh, my God.

1337
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,060
And then he fucking does it.

1338
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:18,660
Okay.

1339
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:19,920
Let's fight.

1340
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:23,540
Okay.

1341
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,320
See, I got that correct.

1342
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:27,660
I'm out.

1343
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:31,940
Bro, give me a sec.

1344
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,060
There you go.

1345
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,380
All right.

1346
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,200
That's fine.

1347
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,160
That's just cutscene.

1348
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,180
That's just cutscene damage.

1349
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:48,980
Oh, nice.

1350
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:51,900
Clever, girl.

1351
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,420
Oh, not clever enough.

1352
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:57,260
Okay.

1353
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:00,560
Jesus.

1354
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:01,360
Jesus.

1355
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:01,720
Okay.

1356
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:03,080

Oh, that is free stuff.

1522
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,460
I was gonna say.

1523
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:50,200
There must be something over there.

1524
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,900
Leave no raider behind.

1525
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:00,620
What's that?

1526
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:02,220
Oh, shit!

1527
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:02,860
What the hell, brother?

1528
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,580
What was that?

1529
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,940
Yeah, what the fuck was that?

1530
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:05,900
And dangerous.

1531
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:07,400
Be on guard.

1532
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:08,160
Oh, yeah.

1533
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:09,640
Being all the way on guard.

1534
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:10,760
She disappeared.

1535
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:13,460
The free stuff here, though?

1536
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:14,780
Oh, yeah, free stuff.

1537
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:16,120
Here's the temple now.

1538
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,680
Just need to find a way around.

1539
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:20,280
Is that...

1540
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:21,180
Oh, wait, no, that's not...

1541
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:22,040
Oh, wait, that is heals.

1542
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:23,300
I actually needed it anyway.

1543
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:26,960
Wait, that's the temple?

1544
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:28,320
But what's over there?

1545
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:30,340
There was a crazy lady back there.

1546
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,680
Oh, I'll burn this.

1547
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:39,440
Burn!

1548
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:41,420
Burn, baby, burn.

1549
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:43,640
Okay, nice.

1550
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:44,200
Free stuff.

1551
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:59,220

shoot arrows at him oh shit oh that's what they would mean

1553
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:17,840
by behind I was like behind where do you mean behind behind
when did this bridge collapse oh not a little

1554
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:28,660
i remember to click the other button i said there was
someone i got multitask better about the giants and loki you

1555
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:36,800

for a dead man who didn't seem pretty keen on seeing he

1556
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:50,500
wasn't found right so he might not be dead plus who could be
faking it so enough I knew it.

1557
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:54,120
I was just always hidden stuff back here.

1558
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:56,660
Is there anything?

1559
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:57,180
Nice.

1560
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:57,880
More money.

1561
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:04,480
Come on, boy.

1562
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:05,620
Go in.

1563
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:10,820
Okay.

1564
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,220
Burn!

1565
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,300
I fucking run!

1566
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:18,700
Get out of here.

1567
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:20,420
Oh, shit.

1568
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:21,480
Wait, you came back.

1569
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:25,040
That's gonna sit.

1570
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:25,960
Is there any back?

1571
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:27,680
It's okay.

1572
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,420
I could do this again.

1573
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:33,700
That's right.

1574
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:34,980
And again!

1575
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,360
Use it often.

1576
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:40,720
I didn't think I need to use it here.

1577
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:42,500
They weren't that much of a threat.

1578
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,120
Like...

1579
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:47,100
They were not a threat to me.

1580
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:52,560
That's like, bro, you're not even, I don't even need to use
my, oh.

1581
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:02,870
Uh, that pillar wasn't in the way last time I came.

1582
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:06,230
An angle, lashed the blade.

1583
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:09,210
Lashed the blade.

1584
02:02:09,970 --> 02:02:10,110
Oh.

1585
02:02:11,970 --> 02:02:13,710
Am I not latching it?

1586
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:17,510
Oh, it's circle.

1587
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:22,630
Guys, I don't know.

1588
02:02:23,490 --> 02:02:23,890
Oh, I can.

1589
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:25,150
Push it back and forth.

1590
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:26,210
That's funny.

1591
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:33,510
I keep thinking it's not a circle because it's not red.

1592
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:36,910
I don't know why, but Brie just can't compute it.

1593
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:38,310
Here was an ally to the giant.

1594
02:02:39,210 --> 02:02:40,930
So he'd be on our side if we find him.

1595
02:02:40,950 --> 02:02:42,050
She's forgetting that.

1596
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:44,150
I was like, what cheap is that?

1597
02:02:45,370 --> 02:02:46,350
Simple is it?

1598
02:02:46,450 --> 02:02:47,050
There's a piece out there.

1599
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:49,390
We gotta find him.

1600
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:50,550
How can we not?

1601
02:02:50,790 --> 02:02:52,570
Those are many ifs, Atreus.

1602
02:02:53,970 --> 02:03:01,840
know you'll see soon is there not supposed to go up there
the shapes what do they mean

something over there how do i get there

1607
02:03:55,860 --> 02:04:07,260

1608
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:09,060
Oh.

1609
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:11,900
Charge up with fire.

1610
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,620
Follow up with...

1611
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:15,220
Oh my god.

1612
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:17,700
Oh shit.

Wait, that's so fucking strong.

1614
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:21,900
Wait, what the fuck?

1615
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:26,860
Wait, this move is so fucking strong.

1616
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,380
I can just do that all the time.

1617
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,120
Okay, I need to even shoot your arrows, boy.

1618
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:33,040
Bro, the guy is in front of you, boy.

1619
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:35,260

Okay.

1629
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,660
We can grab my health real fast.

1630
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:18,100
All right, nice.

1631
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:22,080
Oh my god, not the fire, not the fire.

1632
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:24,720
Bam!

1633
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:30,200
Okay.

1634
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:31,880
Where is she?

1635
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:34,860
It's fine.

1636
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:37,660
I assume... I assume he's got this right now.

1637
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:41,360
You know what?

1638
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:42,500
Nope.

1639
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:47,040
Okay, I guess they're...

1640
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:50,940
Okay, not enough... Okay, now that's enough range.

1641
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:51,940
I got it.

1642
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:54,640
I was like, whoop, not in enough range, I guess.

1643
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:02,940
Alright, we should be full HP now.

1644
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:08,300
Oh, I grab the blades.

1645
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:11,300
Burn, baby.

1646
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:14,100
Is that everything?

1647
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:16,200
Anything I'm missing?

1648
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:17,800
Nah, we're good.

1649
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:27,190
Isn't it nice how Fimblewinter wore down all the helpful
magic we acquired?

1650
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:29,990
Yet somehow new terrors only flourish.

1651
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:31,970
I know, it's so...

1652
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:33,690
Like, like this.

1653
02:07:34,370 --> 02:07:34,970
You know what?

1654
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:35,690
Like...

1655
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,510
Oh, shit!

1656
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:39,810
Oh, yeah, this doesn't work.

1657
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:40,930
I forgot there are ice.

1658
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:42,930
My axe is ice.

1659
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:47,870
Sorry, I almost forgot about that important detail.

1660
02:07:48,590 --> 02:07:49,090
It's crazy.

1661
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:51,450
Ice is non-effective against ice.

1662
02:07:51,790 --> 02:07:52,490
Who would have thought?

1663
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:58,080
What's this?

1664
02:07:58,260 --> 02:07:58,940
Read, boy.

1665
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,520
Oh, I can read now.

1666
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:02,540
I can read!

1667
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:09,220
Oh, my God.

1668
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:10,960
My boy taught me how to read.

1669
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:14,800
Oh,

1670
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:18,720
yeah.

1671
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:19,040
Oh, yeah.

1672
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:20,480
I don't have to piggyback him anymore.

1673
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:21,160
Oh, my God.

1674
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:22,600
He's growing up.

1675
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:23,220
That's it.

1676
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,740
Boy is growing up.

1677
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:27,660
Yeah, it's another boy is growing up.

1678
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:29,020
Yeah, I killed him.

1679
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:30,560
Oh, shit.

1680
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:37,020
Nice.

1681
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:39,560
Easy.

1682
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:45,440
What is this?

1683
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:47,440
Oh yeah, it was this and then...

1684
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:49,460
What's this?

1685
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:51,980
Okay, so this is for climbing.

1686
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,840
Let's see if there's anything...

1687
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:57,340
Okay, I just want to make sure there's nothing I'm missing
around.

1688
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,080
Oh wait, what's this?

1689
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:02,240
I don't know.

1690
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:03,280
It looked like a thing.

1691
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:04,000
I could chop.

1692
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:07,460
I looked like a chop chop.

1693
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:10,000
I guess I climb up.

1694
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:15,560
Oh, oh!

1695
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:17,640
What?

1696
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:25,960
Oh, wait, that's not her.

1697
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:26,900
That's someone else.

1698
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:28,280
The Huntress?

1699
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:29,520
Oh, my God.

1700
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:34,660
Okay, it wasn't Freya.

1701
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:39,720
Okay.

1702
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,720
Oh, wait, I can punch her.

1703
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:43,280
Equality, bitch!

1704
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:45,300
It's self-defense now!

1705
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:46,860
Yeah, that's not Freya.

1706
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:49,480
I thought it was Freya because of the...

1707
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:51,160
Because, you know, she fucking shot.

1708
02:09:51,220 --> 02:10:01,000
me it's like a fucking fair assumption when you get shot
from the lady that's been trying to kill me the entire time

1709
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:14,520
bro he's just fucking running fucking coward it's hard to
grow it might be a weak point wait what if oh shit okay i

1711
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:23,700
Let's keep shooting her!

1712
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,640
Shoot her, boy!

1713
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:30,520
Okay.

1714
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:32,820
Oh my god, I keep forgetting she's a fucking deer.

1715
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:34,300
Or a horse.

1716
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:34,800
I don't know.

1717
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:35,600
No, that's a deer.

1718
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:36,100
That's a deer.

1719
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:39,740
Never stand behind a horse, guys.

1720
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:41,140
It's very dangerous.

1721
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:43,860
Oh my god, I did it.

1722
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:44,500
That's it.

1723
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:45,220
I'm going to...

1724
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:46,120
Boy, you go...

1725
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:46,700
Okay, boy.

1726
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:47,780
No, not like that.

1727
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:48,900
Wrong way, boy.

1728
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:52,520
Okay, it's fine.

1729
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:53,620
You need to go.

1730
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:55,040
Jesus Christ.

1731
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:57,440
That's fucking right.

1732
02:10:58,100 --> 02:10:59,260
Get out of here!

1733
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:01,780
Self-defense!

1734
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:03,360
Oh hey, nice.

1735
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:06,560
What is she?

1736
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:08,400
Broken my shield.

1737
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:10,040
She broke my shield.

1738
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:10,920
It doesn't matter.

1739
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:18,120
She broke my shield.

1740
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:18,480
She broke my shield?

1741
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:21,100
It doesn't matter if I got some scraps.

1742
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,840
Oh man, at least I got some scraps.

1743
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:31,940
Well, I'm around the to run up and strike.

1744
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,100
Oh, okay, new thing.

1745
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:35,060
Oh, nice.

1746
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:38,860
I can put stuff now.

1747
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:41,320
Oh, yeah!

1748
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:45,380
Okay, what about my blade?

1749
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:46,040
Nope.

1750
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:49,480
My shield doesn't regen?

1751
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:54,400
Did I hold it out and want to perform?

1752
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:56,880
Okay.

1753
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:57,600
Oh.

1754
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:02,930
Well, it's like, where's my shield?

1755
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:04,190
It doesn't grow back.

1756
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:08,450
Father, your shield mom gave you.

1757
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:10,070
Thor damaged it.

1758
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:11,030
But now...

1759
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,150
No!

1760
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:13,990
Perhaps.

1761
02:12:14,670 --> 02:12:16,770
The only thing I have for my wife.

1762
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:18,030
I'm younger than our son.

1763
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:20,730
But like, you know...

1764
02:12:20,730 --> 02:12:21,810
That's different.

1765
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:26,150
Why are we here, Treyus?

1766
02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:27,110
Okay.

1767
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:31,210
You remember all those shrines we found telling the stories
of giants?

1768
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:35,630
How the panel on the left would be their origin and the
panel on the right would be their fate?

1769
02:12:36,150 --> 02:12:37,530
Yes, we found many.

1770
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:39,050
I have seen them.

1771
02:12:40,490 --> 02:12:42,750
Well, there's more to them than we realized.

1772
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:47,310
Nothing here?

1773
02:12:49,170 --> 02:12:50,830
What the fuck did it bring me here?

1774
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:59,040
Oh, and my huge axe too.

1775
02:12:59,140 --> 02:12:59,600
Yeah, it's true.

1776
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:01,260
Yeah, but it's like, um...

1777
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:03,720
It's like a two-for-one deal, you know?

1778
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,440
Like, it's matching.

1779
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:08,360
Now I don't have a matching scent no more.

1780
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:14,120
That's different.

1781
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:19,540
Okay, I have to get rid of that tree first.

1782
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:23,880
Can I just chop it here?

1783
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:25,380
Okay, yeah.

1784
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:26,160
That should help.

1785
02:13:31,700 --> 02:13:32,800
There we go.

1786
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:33,720
Come on.

1787
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:37,120
Anything else here?

1788
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:41,740
Things collapsing on a regular basis in these parts.

1789
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:44,360
Fimble Winter wears down all things.

1790
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:46,360
There's like so many items here.

1791
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:49,360
Like, I can't reach it.

1792
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:51,000
My legs aren't tall enough.

1793
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:54,820
Oh, there we go.

1794
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,120
Yay!

1795
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:00,280
Don't need no legs to get that.

1796
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,260
How do I open this, though?

1797
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:14,480
Maybe?

1798
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,380
No, that's where I...

1799
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:18,500
Can I open this?

1800
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:22,470
Oh.

1801
02:14:24,970 --> 02:14:25,530
Oh, hey.

1802
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:27,310
Just a secret passage.

1803
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:29,930
Nice.

1804
02:14:33,910 --> 02:14:34,270
Yeah.

1805
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:36,250
Free robbing time.

1806
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:40,150
Alright, now we can go, boy.

1807
02:14:41,030 --> 02:14:48,970
can progress i found the secret tunnel it's plot progression
time all

1808
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:58,170
right oh reading

1809
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:14,440

level

1810
02:15:20,050 --> 02:15:26,050
wait he destroyed it oh saruna thank you for the red thank
you thank you yeah we had a great shroom

1811
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:36,940
See, I'm so accepting of my son.

1812
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:40,660
He revealed himself to be a magic user and I accepted him.

1813
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:42,520
Yeah, I don't think he's waiting.

1814
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:48,220
Look, I've, like, I, like, accepted him.

1815
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:55,950
I was like, my son will never be a magic user.

1816
02:15:56,590 --> 02:15:58,410
And now I am proud of him.

1817
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,670
Somewhere only giants were meant to see.

1818
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:03,410
These shrines tell their stories to the world.

1819
02:16:06,010 --> 02:16:17,590
the secret stories we're still working on the furry part one
at a time one at a time Odin captured them because he thinks

1820
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:25,230
it'll help him control when Ragnarok starts I remember but
that's not the whole story see this shows the giant setting

1821
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:34,070
skull and how do you free they're free oh is this the past
or the future depends when you're looking at it spoken like

1822
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:37,270
a giant see The wolves are safe.

1823
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:38,470
Somewhere in Vanaheim.

1824
02:16:38,810 --> 02:16:40,030
Okay, so we have to find the wolves.

1825
02:16:42,390 --> 02:16:43,550
Oh, my God.

1826
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:44,470
No, is that the horse?

1827
02:16:45,310 --> 02:16:47,370
Oh, my God.

1828
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:47,710
No.

1829
02:16:48,570 --> 02:16:50,510
Look, the moon gets stolen.

1830
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:51,410
Uh?

1831
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:52,010
Somehow.

1832
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:53,270
Atreus.

1833
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:54,390
See?

1834
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:56,370
Hathi's got nothing to chase.

1835
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:59,710
And they say celestial theft is a victimless crime.

1836
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:01,390
Who was carrying the moon?

1837
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:04,030
That looked like a horse.

1838
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:05,710
But someone comes along and...

1839
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:12,790
rescues the moon and then the moon blocks out the Sun a
total eclipse oh I haven't seen one of those in a hundred

1840
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:23,790
winters but then they chase an arrow and things go back to
normal what does any of this have to do we're coming to that

1841
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:36,460
look here's Ragnarok do you see who's leading the armies
against Odin that's Tyr if he's to be around at ragnarok

1842
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:45,380
yeah i'm gonna say live yeah because ragnarok hasn't started
yet we're here can this be odin told me he killed tier and

1843
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:52,980
he trusted me at the time or so i thought oh so he was lying
what if he's just had him locked up somewhere all this time

1844
02:17:52,980 --> 02:18:01,600
we are back to ifs enough wait we are going home wait i have
one more thing to show you it's just out here

1845
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:05,980
Oh, I can move.

1846
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:07,310
Where is it?

1847
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:09,420
Okay.

1848
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,860
Upshot thickens.

1849
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:18,900
Why wouldn't he just kill Tyr to make sure the prophecy
doesn't come true?

1850
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:20,200
Is he stupid?

1851
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:22,000
Well, almost everything.

1852
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:31,680
Yes.

1853
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:37,360
Oh, he went in!

1854
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:37,960
Look at him.

1855
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:38,420
Oh, no.

1856
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:40,080
Other shrines?

1857
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:41,740
How many have you visited?

1858
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:43,820
I...

1859
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:44,220
Well...

1860
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:46,680
This is why you haven't been trading, boy!

1861
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:48,800
All the ones I could still get to in Midgard anyway.

1862
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:51,540
I don't know what it is.

1863
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:54,120
But it's important.

1864
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:56,460
Just like all this.

1865
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:03,500
When I was inside one of the shrines, I saw an image of Tear
imprisoned.

1866
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:05,360
But I couldn't tell where.

1867
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:08,520
There are hints inside the other shrines.

1868
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:13,540
They mention black smoke and the bleeding earth.

1869
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:27,080
but we can never figure out exactly we who's we yeah me me
and helping me Sindri look I talked him into it it it wasn't

1870
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:37,820
his idea Sindri I just needed someone to watch my back bro
you're a fucking rat son you're a fucking rat son what

1871
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:48,760
happened bro you snitched him out just like that could could
the prison be in Musbleheim unlikely Odin's got no presence

1872
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:58,720
I did not raise no rat primordial realms for the bleeding
out sounds like a mine I you got that from your mother good

1873
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:07,620
bet their minds did burst black smoke and Odin's had his
thumb on the dwarves for a very long time that's it then

1874
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:13,760
tears and fartle find somewhere imprisoned in a mine so what
now

1875
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:26,760
Oh shit.

1876
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:29,560
We still have to survive.

1877
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:30,240
This way.

1878
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:33,080
Vlad, even if we can send out looking for Tia.

1879
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:35,920
Oh, wait.

1880
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:36,940
Oh, my shield.

1881
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:38,180
My broken shield.

1882
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:39,400
No!

1883
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:43,320
My wife's gift for me!

1884
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:45,440
But boy, she died.

1885
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:49,140
Alright, I didn't even grab a...

1886
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:50,180
Wait, what's this?

1887
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:51,280
Oh, I can't.

1888
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:52,620
Oh, I can slice multiple.

1889
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:53,820
That's good.

1890
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:58,140
I'm like, oh, fuck.

1891
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:00,440
I need to remember to upgrade for chaos.

1892
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:03,300
Because that doesn't...

1893
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:06,680
Yeah, I need to remember to not waste it for chaos shit.

1894
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:10,600
Jesus, you take so long to level up.

1895
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,340
How do you have us getting to Sparklefine?

1896
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:16,380
You know Odin's had all travel between realms locked up
tight.

1897
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,920
Sindri said he had an idea or two about that.

1898
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:21,060
Sindri is full of ideas.

1899
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:21,760
Hmm.

1900
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:23,980
The ground looks kind of cracked there.

1901
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:27,300
There's a shortcut this way.

1902
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:28,400
Where?

1903
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:29,640
Oh, this way.

1904
02:21:34,670 --> 02:21:35,850
What's under there, Ethan?

1905
02:21:36,610 --> 02:21:37,170
Boom!

1906
02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:41,150
Ah, back to smashing through things for fun and profit.

1907
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:41,990
That's fucking right.

1908
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:44,630
It's how we do it here.

1909
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:50,330
I'm the god of war, not god of pussy.

1910
02:21:51,990 --> 02:21:52,610
Move me here.

1911
02:21:57,020 --> 02:22:06,680
they stepped outside but he told us about it I wouldn't
worry what about the things he did not tell us where do we

1912
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:25,220
go from here was that just for loot oh I guess it was just
for loot that does sound pretty cool though my wife is dead

1913
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:35,860
remember when we fought our first troll out this way I
remember you lost control we must tread carefully brother

1914
02:22:35,860 --> 02:22:42,800
danger is close you okay fighting without a shield it is not
my first no

1915
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:49,540
okay that's cool

1916
02:22:53,320 --> 02:23:01,420
i don't need no shield for what i'm about to do Later!

1917
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:02,300
On the way!

1918
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:03,960
Okay, it's fine.

1919
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:09,040
Well, not fine for my blood, but it's fine for me, though.

1920
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:12,620
It's fine.

1921
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:15,520
Oh, shit!

1922
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:16,240
Okay.

1923
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:17,640
That's fine for me.

1924
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:25,680
There we go.

1925
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:26,800
Chop time.

1926
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:27,400
Chop, chop!

1927
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:31,800
Oh shit!

1928
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:33,400
Wait, I should have just used his weapon.

1929
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:36,940
Bro, his weapon was cool!

1930
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:41,840
That Insta snapped his neck.

1931
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,020
Almost home.

1932
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:48,440
Brother, a word.

1933
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:49,300
Yes.

1934
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:51,900
Don't hold the lad's curiosity against him.

1935
02:23:52,460 --> 02:23:53,780
It goes with being young.

1936
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,220
Yeah, I'll go put a cat in there.

1937
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:58,200
And is that what you wish for him?

1938
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:00,780
Brother, he's going to walk his way.

1939
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:01,420
own path.

1940
02:24:02,220 --> 02:24:06,820
If you don't want him walking away from you, then smarten up
and walk with him a while.

1941
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:09,880
Yeah, we don't want to lose him.

1942
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:12,200
We can't leave him unsupervised.

1943
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:18,460
If we could find a way to open Rome travel to Sparta Farm, I
bet there'd be all sorts of useful equipment for us to do.

1944
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:20,180
We will go.

1945
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:21,020
Really?

1946
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:21,680
You could not.

1947
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:23,480
Oh, no, he worked.

1948
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:25,820
You will abandon your search.

1949
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:26,800
Go good.

1950
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,540
Just for fun.

1951
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:31,920
Oh, no.

1952
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:35,680
He's already learned to successfully manipulate me.

1953
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:37,000
Oh, no.

1954
02:24:38,300 --> 02:24:39,280
It's too late.

1955
02:24:47,210 --> 02:24:49,170
He used gear.

1956
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:50,490
Sentry.

1957
02:24:51,870 --> 02:24:53,470
As I live and breathe.

1958
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:54,730
Is that Atreus?

1959
02:24:55,330 --> 02:24:56,970
It's been so long.

1960
02:24:57,190 --> 02:24:58,810
How you've grown.

1961
02:24:59,330 --> 02:25:01,030
Uh, oh, yeah.

1962
02:25:01,610 --> 02:25:06,650
Well, if you'll follow me, I believe he runs.

1963
02:25:07,390 --> 02:25:10,030
I believe your favorite dwarves can help you out with that.

1964
02:25:11,010 --> 02:25:12,190
We're still your favorite dwarves.

1965
02:25:12,790 --> 02:25:14,150
I think he's the only dwarves.

1966
02:25:16,270 --> 02:25:18,990
I was like, I think he's only met you guys.

1967
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:23,490
Well, it's like I wrote this game.

1968
02:25:23,630 --> 02:25:24,930
After you, my friends.

1969
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:32,160
Almost like I wrote it.

1970
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:34,960
The cleanest cabin in all the nine realms.

1971
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:37,160
And I'd prefer it to stay that way.

1972
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:45,580
not looking at anyone in particular yeah that run was pretty
fucking funny we thought we should make up some rooms until

1973
02:25:45,580 --> 02:25:50,500
you can figure out your next moves nearly there so far

1974
02:25:55,630 --> 02:26:06,150
this guy's never ran in this life oh that's nice I mean you
won't get any customers other than me but that's nice really

1975
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:12,390
can't beat the view if you're into shimmering gray voids
Like, who's going to fucking find this place other than me?

1976
02:26:12,410 --> 02:26:14,210
You have a plan to talk to you about, actually.

1977
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:15,790
Intriguing.

1978
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:18,550
Come in.

1979
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:19,390
Come in.

1980
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:24,390
Now, if you would just wipe your feet very thoroughly, I'll
wait.

1981
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:27,830
You're not going to wipe your feet, are you?

1982
02:26:28,410 --> 02:26:29,010
Okay, then.

1983
02:26:29,190 --> 02:26:30,130
Your bedrooms are there.

1984
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:31,710
The kitchen is just over there.

1985
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:33,670
Anybody need a snack?

1986
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:34,850
Kratos?

1987
02:26:35,090 --> 02:26:35,890
I'm so hungry.

1988
02:26:36,330 --> 02:26:37,490
I do not need a snack.

1989
02:26:37,650 --> 02:26:38,030
Oh, okay.

1990
02:26:38,070 --> 02:26:39,250
I'm not hungry, I guess.

1991
02:26:39,710 --> 02:26:48,670

nice i mean that's what it's okay i told him everything

eye on him on your behalf nothing risky everything very safe

mud.

1995
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:14,830
Then why haven't you opened the way already, man?

1996
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:19,310
Well, to be frank, there was something we needed your help
with.

1997
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:27,130
Oh, the Holder brothers finally require the services of the
smartest man alive.

1998
02:27:29,530 --> 02:27:30,090
Oh!

1999
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:32,170
Not so fast.

2000
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:36,490
Do we ever find out why he's blue and he's not?

2001
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:39,390
When the hell is he?

2002
02:27:39,710 --> 02:27:41,510
Boy, that is my son.

2003
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:46,670
Well, what in all yarns me the happen to him?

2004
02:27:46,730 --> 02:27:47,390
What the fuck?

2005
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:48,670
He looks the same.

2006
02:27:49,070 --> 02:27:49,730
He's just taller.

2007
02:27:50,190 --> 02:27:51,710
And he looks like...

2008
02:27:52,770 --> 02:27:53,290
That.

2009
02:27:54,930 --> 02:27:56,710
He looks the same.

2010
02:27:57,790 --> 02:27:59,030
Well, come on, then.

2011
02:27:59,130 --> 02:28:00,810
He's just a little taller.

2012
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:03,650
He's just getting older, you dark plat.

2013
02:28:04,030 --> 02:28:06,270
Didn't you ever have an awkward face in your youth?

2014
02:28:06,490 --> 02:28:06,830
Hey.

2015
02:28:07,230 --> 02:28:09,370
You suppose what he's done is done?

2016
02:28:10,110 --> 02:28:13,910
They'll be putting your foot down from now on if you know
what's good.

2017
02:28:14,390 --> 02:28:17,010
His dad, their dad's fell in love with a smurf.

2018
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:19,810
All right, let's gear you fuckers up before you go.

2019
02:28:24,750 --> 02:28:26,990
I fix my shield, please.

2020
02:28:30,610 --> 02:28:33,050
Wouldn't you rather I just whip you up a new one?

2021
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:33,630
No.

2022
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:36,090
It is important to me.

2023
02:28:37,150 --> 02:28:38,590
It matches my axe.

2024
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:54,970
see what i can do in the meanwhile how about i fix you up
with something to get you by i guess oh okay i guess i'll

2025
02:28:54,970 --> 02:29:07,430
grab something mediocre for high risk and high rewards parry
a shield for absorbing attacks and striking back you know

2026
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:09,470
what fuck it let's gamble

2027
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:23,020
I might miss a lot but it's all about the one time I get it
right and everyone in my chat would be like oh my god donkey

2028
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:32,280
that was so cool it doesn't matter if I fail a million times
but the one time I get it right you're all gonna freak the

2029
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:34,640
fuck out and I'm here for that one high

2030
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:48,780
fuck that was so cool it might take a long time to get it to
happen but when it had the payoff will be worth it i'm here

2031
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:57,520
for the payoff if the kid's gonna insist on getting taller
best make a habit of swinging in for new all right i guess

2032
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:04,320
you can grab something yeah she buried that yeah

2033
02:30:09,060 --> 02:30:11,800
50 hits just for that one Perry.

2034
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:13,940
I'd be like, did you see that, guys?

2035
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:17,960
Did I be like fucking bleeding out of, like, bleeding
everywhere?

2036
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,720
I'm like, guys, did you see that?

2037
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:23,080
Because I did it.

2038
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:26,040
Because I fucking did it, guys.

2039
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:35,000
Wait, I should grab this, actually.

2040
02:30:40,170 --> 02:30:41,170
Upgrade it.

2041
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:44,510
Actually...

2042
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:46,350
Bounce some items you left behind.

2043
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:48,130
Tossed him in the chest.

2044
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:49,610
We will clap for you.

2045
02:30:50,070 --> 02:30:50,650
Patch your ass in.

2046
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:51,970
Thank you for the secret chat.

2047
02:30:52,310 --> 02:30:52,790
Thank you.

2048
02:30:53,070 --> 02:30:54,830
All right.

2049
02:30:55,170 --> 02:30:56,150
Things I forgot to loot.

2050
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:59,950
It's going to look so cool, guys, when it happens.

2051
02:31:03,570 --> 02:31:04,650
Yeah, I want to...

2052
02:31:11,070 --> 02:31:13,410
Okay, that does look good, though.

2053
02:31:14,170 --> 02:31:15,070
All right.

2054
02:31:15,130 --> 02:31:16,050
Let's do it.

2055
02:31:19,450 --> 02:31:20,730
Okay, well, dude.

2056
02:31:23,050 --> 02:31:26,930
I like the idea that it's 11 and 17.

2057
02:31:28,850 --> 02:31:31,010
Oh, but then it gives me a second rune.

2058
02:31:33,350 --> 02:31:33,970
But...

2059
02:31:33,970 --> 02:31:36,050
But then 17 looks so cool.

2060
02:31:36,110 --> 02:31:37,370

2061
02:31:37,950 --> 02:31:38,830

2064
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:43,250
There we go.

2065
02:31:43,690 --> 02:31:50,450

breastplate and paltron in all of creation.

2074
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:39,140
Whoops.

2075
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:40,300

02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:41,180

02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:57,240
Oh wait, not you.

2084
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:58,540
Not you.

2085
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:01,780
We got it.

2086
02:33:02,380 --> 02:33:03,140
Where is it?

2087
02:33:03,180 --> 02:33:03,900
There we go.

2088
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:06,800
There we go.

2089
02:33:06,980 --> 02:33:08,140
It's been freed now.

2090
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:11,840
Oh wait, wait.

2091
02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:12,600
He had the door.

2092
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:13,380
I'm pretty sure.

2093
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:13,720
Yeah.

2094
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:17,860
How's life been treating everyone's favorite as your
vulgarian?

2095
02:33:18,220 --> 02:33:19,920
The fuck you call me?

2096
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:21,800
Exquisite.

2097
02:33:24,380 --> 02:33:25,340
Alright, where do we go?

2098
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:29,080
That's nice.

2099
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:32,340
Definitely made a home here.

2100
02:33:34,580 --> 02:33:37,180
It's like, I am not hungry.

2101
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:41,240
I guess this is where they store the food.

2102
02:33:41,980 --> 02:33:43,620
Nice to have options if I wake up hungry.

2103
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:45,340
Oh, that's cool.

2104
02:33:45,440 --> 02:33:47,320
They have their own little pantry and everything.

2105
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:49,280
Finding everything all right, I hope.

2106
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:51,180
I actually need to pee.

2107
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:52,340

2108
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:59,120

All right, here we go.

2125
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:09,280
This, we have knots.

2126
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:10,120
Oh, my God.

2127
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:10,640
I...

2128
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:13,540
Okay, that's fine.

2129
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:15,500
This is a modern gaming.

2130
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:16,200
I don't have to work.

2131
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:17,240
We have auto save.

2132
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:20,480
We'll just need something from back at the workshop.

2133
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:23,200
Follow me and be sure to bring the head.

2134
02:38:26,260 --> 02:38:26,660
See?

2135
02:38:27,460 --> 02:38:28,000
Yes, head.

2136
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:30,940
He's imprisoned in a mine somewhere.

2137
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:32,700
He's like, no head?

2138
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:35,560
The realm is full of mines.

2139
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:38,100
You realize you'll need help narrowing your way.

2140
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:39,500
I was like, oh my god, did not save once.

2141
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:40,940
You should talk to Dirling.

2142
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:47,720
is a modern game they have a lot of safety you don't have to
be paranoid works for the city on safety issues should have

2143
02:38:47,720 --> 02:38:55,420
access to all kinds of information on mines and i know he's
no friend of odin that's why your mother sought his help

2144
02:38:55,420 --> 02:39:04,980
when she was trying to whip up a rebellion ready oh no yeah

2147
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:25,180

2148
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:33,640
That's why he's blue and he don't you I suppose you think

02:39:38,020 --> 02:39:38,200
I'm not.

2152
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:49,540
Yeah, no never mind Brock's place to cast disparagations on
my relations this smudge sponge or not withstanding ignoring

2153
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:59,320

how it goes just be warned he's not the friendly sort of

2154
02:39:59,320 --> 02:40:12,260
dwarf folk you're used to he's cranky as all get out and he
talk money too sounds like a true study in contrast I've

2155
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:13,730
always wanted to see your home realm.

2156
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:14,520
Yeah.

2157
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:16,560
It sounds unique.

2158
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:17,920
Spartal time.

2159
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:20,460
Stupid ace year name.

2160
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:23,200
We look like dark elves to you.

2161
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:24,000
Whoa!

2162
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:32,060
No matter where we go, dwarf elf racisms will always exist.

2163
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:38,860
It ain't hardly somewhere a self-respecting dwarf would show
us.

2164
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:40,440
Tell us old as time.

2165
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:48,110
Let's go, oh, we go outside.

2166
02:40:49,810 --> 02:40:51,730
God damn, right.

2167
02:40:54,890 --> 02:41:00,530
No matter where we go, no matter what game we play, one
thing we know for sure.

2168
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:06,710
Dwarves and elves is like, just like oil and water.

2169
02:41:07,550 --> 02:41:08,090
Through the touching.

2170
02:41:08,530 --> 02:41:11,370
Oh, this would be the part requiring your assistance then.

2171
02:41:12,170 --> 02:41:12,910
You said it.

2172
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:15,470
This device here has been crafted to your measurements.

2173
02:41:15,890 --> 02:41:18,250
It'll help me get a better look at the problem with those.

2174
02:41:18,290 --> 02:41:18,750
Oh my god.

2175
02:41:18,910 --> 02:41:24,530

02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:48,150
wheelchair in Marvel Rivals.

2180
02:41:49,970 --> 02:41:51,090
It makes me so sad.

2181
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:55,070
I wanted to run people over.

2182
02:41:58,330 --> 02:41:58,550
Yeah.

2183
02:41:59,410 --> 02:42:06,010
They're going to be because like apparently he's been like

not on his wheelchair longer than being in the wheelchair.

2185
02:42:15,650 --> 02:42:16,290
Permanent damage.

2186
02:42:16,930 --> 02:42:17,670
I'll show you.

2187
02:42:17,950 --> 02:42:18,970
Permanent damage, are we?

2188
02:42:19,170 --> 02:42:19,410
Fuck.

2189
02:42:20,310 --> 02:42:20,330
Gritos.

2190
02:42:20,810 --> 02:42:21,790
Romy that to him.

2191
02:42:21,790 --> 02:42:22,790
Horns first.

2192
02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:25,110
You know, cowards.

2193
02:42:26,330 --> 02:42:28,490
Someone break his ankles again.

2194
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:31,770
Someone sent another bullet to his spine.

2195
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:39,860
The Bifrost is broken.

2196
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:43,720
Now that we reconciled to these gateways, but it fucking
sucks.

2197
02:42:44,140 --> 02:42:46,820
How dare he able to be able to walk again?

2198
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,560
I also used it for light.

2199
02:42:50,380 --> 02:42:51,500
Okay, good note.

2200
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:52,540
I'll figure something out.

2201
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:55,460
But first, come on, let me show you how it works.

2202
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:04,040
Alright.

2203
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:05,840
How does it work?

2204
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:08,080
Okay.

2205
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,620
Is that Swartle Fim?

2206
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:16,140
Oh my god, there's so many worlds.

2207
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:20,360
Oh my god, this is why it takes 25 hours average to beat
this game.

2208
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:21,700
How many worlds are there?

2209
02:43:31,860 --> 02:43:34,360
I just noticed all the fucking portals.

2210
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:40,280

02:44:37,250 --> 02:44:38,690
They're just salamanders.

You're getting your ass beat by fucking reptiles.

2229
02:44:42,190 --> 02:44:42,490

There you go There's still more

2234
02:45:07,910 --> 02:45:12,770
Jesus I'm just gonna switch slap by these guys

2235
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:28,500

smack get smacked oh my god oh my god we can head through

2236
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:29,920
these channels when you're ready

2237
02:45:33,210 --> 02:45:39,590
oh my god that reminded me because we're talking about
roaches I started watching the newest season of fallout it's

2238
02:45:39,590 --> 02:45:46,510
not bad I can see why people who are like fallout purists
who are like super into like the lore of fallout be mad

2239
02:45:46,510 --> 02:45:54,350
about it because um they like changed some stuff about the
lore but like the one thing i don't like about the new

2240
02:45:54,350 --> 02:46:00,870
fallout season two is that there's so many plot lives going
on that they keep jumping jumping jumping jumping jumping

2241
02:46:00,870 --> 02:46:08,630
jumping and i'm just like i'm like i keep thinking like
that's the end of the episode but they keep jumping to a

2242
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:16,710
next plot point and everything and it's i hate it if you
never ask because i just at least one to two one one one

2243
02:46:16,710 --> 02:46:23,650
main story and then another side story but there's like
seven side stories going on at the same time and that's what

2244
02:46:23,650 --> 02:46:34,080
the only that's my biggest gripe about it your mother was
far better at fishing than i what's that did you got fish

2245
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:46,550
what the fuck did you get oh yeah you got fish okay which
way do you go left or right are you serious i always looked

2246
02:46:48,510 --> 02:46:49,970
Brad, the thing is super chat.

2247
02:46:50,050 --> 02:46:50,930
They can think, yeah.

2248
02:46:51,310 --> 02:46:55,750
Yeah, in the comics, they, like, made him, like, he's, he's,
like, recovered now.

2249
02:46:55,850 --> 02:46:56,730
They healed his legs.

2250
02:46:57,050 --> 02:47:00,350
But now he's also, okay, you shouldn't look up to Professor
X anymore.

2251
02:47:00,930 --> 02:47:06,290
Unless you're talking about, like, sir, unless you're
talking about the movie version of Professor X, because the

2252
02:47:06,290 --> 02:47:11,470
comic book of Professor X is, like, an actual asshole, and
he's apparently, like, really evil.

2253
02:47:14,210 --> 02:47:18,150
Like, like, he turned into, like, a super evil guy.

2254
02:47:18,510 --> 02:47:19,630
In the comics.

2255
02:47:20,850 --> 02:47:22,650
I don't remember what he, like, exactly.

2256
02:47:23,150 --> 02:47:25,970
But, like, ever since he learned how to walk.

2257
02:47:27,590 --> 02:47:30,450
He's, like, he's, like, a mean person now.

2258
02:47:32,730 --> 02:47:36,690
He's like, now that I can walk, I'm better than all of you.

2259
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:40,070
Yeah.

2260
02:47:41,350 --> 02:47:42,810
Did you see that over there?

2261
02:47:45,970 --> 02:47:48,110
That's what happens when you learn to walk.

2262
02:47:48,670 --> 02:47:50,510
You just become evil.

2263
02:47:56,940 --> 02:47:57,980
Oh, I grab money.

2264
02:47:59,100 --> 02:48:01,620
You learn to walk, but at what cost?

2265
02:48:06,490 --> 02:48:10,070
Oh yeah, Magneto is a good guy now, and then yeah.

2266
02:48:12,130 --> 02:48:18,210
That's why people were like not happy, no, like, um, when
they're like, when they're like, no!

2267
02:48:21,090 --> 02:48:23,750
Why does he know how to walk now?

2268
02:48:25,470 --> 02:48:36,930
it we should be able to get through so these are wetlands
huh pretty accurate it is a bog the smell is making my eyes

2269
02:48:36,930 --> 02:48:43,970
burn you know what is a fair bit more potent than when I
last visited now that you mention it Larry's like the path

2270
02:48:43,970 --> 02:49:00,400
oh they're like geysers oh if only we were in Midgard that
water is frozen in the second there's a puzzle But I know

2271
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:01,560
how to do this.

2272
02:49:02,500 --> 02:49:03,740
I freeze the...

2273
02:49:04,220 --> 02:49:05,760
Oh, never mind.

2274
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:08,940
I thought I did.

2275
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:11,080
What if you used your axe on it?

2276
02:49:11,140 --> 02:49:11,740
I did.

2277
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:15,140
Oh, like that.

2278
02:49:15,360 --> 02:49:15,640
Yeah.

2279
02:49:16,660 --> 02:49:18,300
Oh, the base!

2280
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:20,880
Oh!

2281
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:23,860
That makes more sense.

2282
02:49:25,480 --> 02:49:28,160
That actually does make more sense.

2283
02:49:31,330 --> 02:49:34,430
I thought I looked so cool doing that

2284
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:47,380
Alright one Where's the second one Oh Two

2285
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:58,100

No, I'm...

2288
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:16,260
All my brain cells is like working overtime, trying to keep
me like breathing.

2289
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:20,820
So I can know how to breathe.

2290
02:50:29,050 --> 02:50:29,910

2291
02:50:31,390 --> 02:50:32,470
Is it like here?

2292
02:50:32,850 --> 02:50:33,310
Hidden there?

2293
02:50:36,850 --> 02:50:38,510
Where the fuck is...

2294
02:50:38,510 --> 02:50:39,590

Tricky.

2297
02:50:44,330 --> 02:50:45,330
Clever girl.

2298
02:50:46,730 --> 02:50:47,950
Grave Mars Brassard.

2299
02:50:48,470 --> 02:50:49,710
Father of a few dwarves.

2300
02:50:49,870 --> 02:50:50,970
You may be well familiar with.

2301
02:50:51,430 --> 02:50:53,470
Rock may be interested in getting these back.

2302
02:50:54,090 --> 02:50:55,650
It's better in his hands than out in the open.

2303
02:50:58,510 --> 02:50:59,950
Oh, look in that book.

2304
02:51:00,090 --> 02:51:01,390
Oh, I get more XP.

2305
02:51:01,770 --> 02:51:03,390
It's from the first game.

2306
02:51:05,030 --> 02:51:05,850
Yay, IP.

2307
02:51:06,670 --> 02:51:08,610
I think that's dirty enough to go on.

2308
02:51:09,130 --> 02:51:10,530
That should be fine.

2309
02:51:12,290 --> 02:51:14,290
Yeah, those dwarves know how to build.

2310
02:51:16,930 --> 02:51:17,670
I got the app.

2311
02:51:19,010 --> 02:51:21,130
I wonder if he and mom ever met.

2312
02:51:22,170 --> 02:51:23,630
If he was a part of the rebellion here.

2313
02:51:24,170 --> 02:51:25,170
It's certainly possible.

2314
02:51:25,790 --> 02:51:26,590
It's so beautiful.

2315
02:51:26,950 --> 02:51:27,170
This game.

2316
02:51:28,130 --> 02:51:28,830
It's really pretty.

2317
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:31,370
I don't recall if you ever declared allegiance outright.

2318
02:51:33,210 --> 02:51:33,610
Come on.

2319
02:51:34,030 --> 02:51:35,790
There's gotta be a faster way to get down there.

2320
02:51:36,250 --> 02:51:37,550
Yeah, use your fucking app.

2321
02:51:37,710 --> 02:51:38,410
Oh, shit.

2322
02:51:38,970 --> 02:51:40,190
Okay, I'm...

02:51:42,110 --> 02:51:42,550
Jesus.

2331
02:51:58,930 --> 02:51:59,450

02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:55,520
Oh my god.

2341
02:52:55,900 --> 02:52:57,000
Okay, guys, guys, guys.

2342
02:52:57,340 --> 02:52:57,840
Where's my clap?

2343
02:52:58,220 --> 02:52:59,800
Guys, guys, guys, start clapping.

2344
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:02,220
Guys, guys, start clapping.

2345
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:09,680
I told you it looked so cool when I do it, right?

2346
02:53:12,740 --> 02:53:16,360
I told you the payoff was worth it, guys.

2347
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:34,860
i told you when it happens you guys didn't believe wait
she's actually coded you guys didn't believe get buried was

2348
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:36,420
that it

2349
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:47,540
look at that guys i told you i could do it it would look so
cool when it happened happens.

2350
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:51,880
There's got to be some way to turn the wheel up here.

2351
02:53:58,640 --> 02:53:59,220
Well, there.

2352
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:04,060
Give a man some warning if he's about to suddenly end up
snout deep in cheek.

2353
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:04,780
The ground.

2354
02:54:05,100 --> 02:54:05,900
Was that an earthquake?

2355
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:06,860
Hmm.

2356
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:07,700
Oh, no.

2357
02:54:08,300 --> 02:54:12,840
I guess like, you know, with all the mining here, the land.

2358
02:54:13,140 --> 02:54:15,820
Yeah, I was going to say, might be very smart.

2359
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:17,260
I think you can reach the wheel from here.

2360
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:21,080
Or is here?

2361
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:24,880
Boy, don't test me a fucking course I can.

2362
02:54:27,880 --> 02:54:29,420
Now, what do I do, boy?

2363
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:30,780
Oh, wow.

2364
02:54:31,320 --> 02:54:32,440
Nice job getting it to lower.

2365
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:33,920
Oh, I have to go down.

2366
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:37,720
Yeah.

2367
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:43,140
Maybe it's not that the cold hasn't made it here yet, but
maybe it's just different in Spartofon?

2368
02:54:43,560 --> 02:54:44,120
By a lot.

2369
02:54:44,600 --> 02:54:46,580
Femble Winter doesn't strike all rare.

2370
02:54:46,580 --> 02:54:48,020
Oh, so it'll happen later.

2371
02:54:48,660 --> 02:54:51,580
Weird that Femble Winter doesn't always...

02:54:51,600 --> 02:55:01,400
make it winter it's like global warming the effects here
appear far more gaseous in nature observe the geysers

02:56:53,580 --> 02:56:54,840
Permanent increases by two.

That's nice.

2393
02:56:56,960 --> 02:56:57,900
That's more than one.

2394
02:57:02,370 --> 02:57:03,790
Alright, I gotta park the boat.

2395
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:10,860

Thank you.

2407
02:57:53,960 --> 02:57:57,120
I hope I remember all these controls when I play this again.

2408
02:57:57,560 --> 02:57:59,360
When we're 2 part 2.

2409
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:04,340
I hope to God I remember all of these controls, guys.

2410
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:06,500
Because it's a lot of controls.

2411
02:58:13,540 --> 02:58:14,620
Speed of Morley Gray.

2412
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:21,300
Remember that time Batman had files for every Justice League
member in case they went evil and it was so shocking oh he

2413
02:58:21,300 --> 02:58:29,680
has that for every oh it's like it's like a permanent record
type deal but instead of like you know his record is just

2414
02:58:29,680 --> 02:58:31,100
how to kill the students

2415
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:43,520
be fair you have a school filled with superpowered like
teenagers going through like puberty and shit like I'd be

2416
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:52,740
worried too I I'm not gonna lie like you know since he is
like the headmaster of like um a squad yeah at your fairy

2417
02:58:52,740 --> 02:58:58,620
who can blame him who can fucking blame him

2418
02:59:03,210 --> 02:59:07,390
a teenager with no superpowers is already a problem

2419
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:17,200
how do I get up there

2420
02:59:22,030 --> 02:59:26,210
uh well I guess I just leave that bucket up there

2421
02:59:32,050 --> 02:59:47,530
Oh Guess we Row away Wait look up Gamers don't look up
Gamers never look up You're telling me to do something crazy

2422
02:59:47,530 --> 02:59:53,980

2423
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:07,600
Is there another up That I'm missing Okay Oh, this?

2424
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:09,540
Fire?

2425
03:00:14,520 --> 03:00:15,320
Okay.

2426
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:20,500
Oh, nice.

2427
03:00:20,920 --> 03:00:21,560
It's fire.

2428
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:25,340
If all I have spells, it's fire time.

2429
03:00:33,530 --> 03:00:33,790
Yeah!

2430
03:00:34,790 --> 03:00:36,490
Fire always works.

2431
03:00:40,530 --> 03:00:42,030
Alright, now we row away.

2432
03:00:46,030 --> 03:00:50,290
I assume it's... Oh wait, there's something glowing in
the... in this lake.

2433
03:00:51,050 --> 03:00:51,870
Boy, pick it up, boy.

2434
03:00:53,050 --> 03:00:55,130
What is causing this water to glow?

2435
03:00:56,170 --> 03:00:56,830
Take it!

2436
03:00:57,610 --> 03:01:01,630
Steal their resources, their natural resources, boy.

2437
03:01:02,690 --> 03:01:04,330
Bring it back to Midgard.

2438
03:01:11,050 --> 03:01:11,550
Oh hey.

2439
03:01:12,150 --> 03:01:13,150
Nah, he's dead.

2440
03:01:14,550 --> 03:01:16,510
The goddamn salamanders.

2441
03:01:19,930 --> 03:01:21,690
I need to use...

2442
03:01:21,690 --> 03:01:22,190
Oh my!

2443
03:01:22,350 --> 03:01:23,530
The stupid fucking...

2444
03:01:24,430 --> 03:01:25,810
Bro, I fucking... I hate...

2445
03:01:25,810 --> 03:01:28,470
Okay, there's no such thing as overkill for these guys.

2446
03:01:31,370 --> 03:01:32,150
That's it!

2447
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:37,210
There's no such thing as overkill for the fucking style of
manners.

2448
03:01:37,970 --> 03:01:40,570
Like, I'm gonna punch the reptile right now.

2449
03:01:45,880 --> 03:01:46,900
They deserve it.

2450
03:01:50,420 --> 03:01:51,040
What's that?

2451
03:01:51,720 --> 03:01:52,760
Did they cap those guys?

2452
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:54,560
Oh.

2453
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:56,200
Hmm.

2454
03:01:56,900 --> 03:01:58,460
I think we need to get that wheel moving.

2455
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:00,400
But the water doesn't reach.

2456
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:02,960
The water wheel moving.

2457
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:03,400
Okay.

2458
03:02:07,120 --> 03:02:08,980
Alright, but I want to know what's up here first.

2459
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:11,100
Puzzle time.

2460
03:02:14,080 --> 03:02:14,600
Oh, shit.

2461
03:02:14,940 --> 03:02:14,940
Okay.

2462
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:18,420
Oh, wait.

2463
03:02:18,580 --> 03:02:19,120
Guys, guys, guys.

2464
03:02:19,320 --> 03:02:19,420
Not yet.

2465
03:02:19,580 --> 03:02:19,700
Not yet.

2466
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:23,840
Oh, my God.

2467
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:25,540
Okay, of course they went back down.

2468
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:28,320
It's okay, you didn't look right?

2469
03:02:28,660 --> 03:02:30,540
Let's thank God you guys closed your eyes, right?

2470
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Where's the other guy?

2471
03:02:34,560 --> 03:02:35,160
There he is.

2472
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:40,960
Alright, nice.

2473
03:02:46,040 --> 03:02:47,100
Wait, so where do I go?

2474
03:02:49,460 --> 03:02:52,840
I didn't even need to, like, freeze it, because there's the
other way here.

2475
03:02:56,120 --> 03:02:56,600
What?

2476
03:03:06,870 --> 03:03:07,650
Where would this?

2477
03:03:07,770 --> 03:03:09,230
Oh, I have to freeze this.

2478
03:03:09,990 --> 03:03:11,070
There we go.

2479
03:03:12,050 --> 03:03:12,530
Puzzle!

2480
03:03:13,870 --> 03:03:14,830
Oh my god, I have to go this way.

2481
03:03:14,970 --> 03:03:16,330
War of an ingenuity for you.

2482
03:03:17,270 --> 03:03:17,790
Back to the boat.

2483
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:19,350
Boat time.

2484
03:03:21,110 --> 03:03:22,070
Boat time.

2485
03:03:22,250 --> 03:03:27,530
If the dwarves of this realm are anything like rock and
sundry, it's hard to imagine them siding with Odin.

2486
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:32,610
Well, all too often people are blinded to all but their
immediate self-interest.

2487
03:03:33,330 --> 03:03:38,070
Odin offered them safety and defying him can be quite
dangerous.

2488
03:03:38,570 --> 03:03:41,590
Maybe they just need a couple of gods to come along and take
the fight to him.

2489
03:03:42,030 --> 03:03:44,190
That is not why we are here.

2490
03:03:45,010 --> 03:03:45,790
I was only joking.

2491
03:03:46,430 --> 03:03:47,330
War is not a joke.

2492
03:03:48,190 --> 03:03:49,710
Especially where gods are concerned.

2493
03:03:49,990 --> 03:03:52,570
But we're literally, you're literally god of war.

2494
03:03:54,550 --> 03:03:55,650
What's the whole point?

2495
03:03:56,410 --> 03:03:59,050
My dad is literally the god of war.

2496
03:03:59,690 --> 03:04:01,910
And war is not an option?

2497
03:04:04,670 --> 03:04:06,710
Might as well not be the god of war anyway.

2498
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:16,120
Like, what's the point of that?

2499
03:04:17,020 --> 03:04:17,560
What's the point?

2500
03:04:17,740 --> 03:04:20,540
What's the point of having a dad who's the god of war but
doesn't even practice war?

2501
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:36,860
He's the god of not war.

2502
03:04:38,440 --> 03:04:40,000
He's retired, Toki.

2503
03:04:40,140 --> 03:04:41,440
Let the man rest.

2504
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:43,160
But there was a frog here.

2505
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:45,800
Arteus, get that frog.

2506
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:48,360
Yikes.

2507
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:50,100
This place is wrecked.

2508
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:51,640
And yes, I am staying alert.

2509
03:04:52,060 --> 03:04:53,660
There are probably tons of those grim around.

2510
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:55,760
Oh my god, there's like...

2511
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:01,840
Oh, I hear them.

2512
03:05:04,240 --> 03:05:06,340
Oh my god, there's so much to explore.

2513
03:05:06,480 --> 03:05:07,760
I'm like so...

2514
03:05:08,380 --> 03:05:10,700
Everywhere right now, be like, where do I go?

2515
03:05:13,080 --> 03:05:15,360
There's so many places to go.

2516
03:05:21,640 --> 03:05:22,200
damn

2517
03:05:25,400 --> 03:05:30,860
that's fucking right you'll shoot your goddamn arrow boy

2518
03:05:34,320 --> 03:05:42,940
I don't need it I have immunity wait I did not have immunity
wait a minute are you trying wait do I not get immunity when

2519
03:05:42,940 --> 03:05:46,680
I do the when I fucking Do like the fucking thing?

2520
03:05:47,160 --> 03:05:47,960
Do I finish it?

2521
03:05:50,620 --> 03:05:51,900
Oh, hey, there's a tree.

2522
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:54,200
Bam!

2523
03:05:55,060 --> 03:05:56,420
It's to send a message.

2524
03:05:57,820 --> 03:05:59,180
I was like, wait a minute.

2525
03:05:59,540 --> 03:06:00,760
I lost HP.

2526
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:04,880
That ain't right.

2527
03:06:06,700 --> 03:06:07,320
It's okay.

2528
03:06:07,460 --> 03:06:08,900
I'm going to grab a tree for real now.

2529
03:06:10,960 --> 03:06:11,380
That's...

2530
03:06:11,380 --> 03:06:12,160
Oh my god.

2531
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:14,580
It's okay.

2532
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:15,340
He can't swim, right?

2533
03:06:18,060 --> 03:06:19,300
Yeah, no.

2534
03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:21,200
What do you mean there's no eye frames?

2535
03:06:22,680 --> 03:06:25,100
Oh, shit.

2536
03:06:26,060 --> 03:06:27,020
Wait, he can dodge.

2537
03:06:27,600 --> 03:06:29,840
I can't dodge my flag shit.

2538
03:06:32,460 --> 03:06:33,880
Can't dodge this, though.

2539
03:06:41,460 --> 03:06:41,700
What?

2540
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:44,940
What is this doing?

2541
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:45,420
What?

2542
03:06:55,800 --> 03:06:58,780
Oh, oh, okay.

2543
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:02,880
Is that the right one?

2544
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:06,460
That's an N.

2545
03:07:07,240 --> 03:07:09,020
Okay, that should be the right one.

2546
03:07:09,160 --> 03:07:09,880
Yeah, there we go.

2547
03:07:10,840 --> 03:07:12,340
We got one of them.

2548
03:07:14,480 --> 03:07:16,440
I think it was an R, right?

2549
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:19,720
No.

2550
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:20,640
B or N?

2551
03:07:24,440 --> 03:07:25,220
Okay, B.

2552
03:07:25,880 --> 03:07:27,140
We're just missing one more.

2553
03:07:34,680 --> 03:07:35,940
Oh my god, we gotta explore.

2554
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:41,520
Calling Kratos God a war while the Greek pantheon is dead.

2555
03:07:41,740 --> 03:07:45,520
It's like still calling someone the head manager to a
blockbuster employee.

2556
03:07:46,500 --> 03:07:48,480
They give us a super chat banana.

2557
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:50,260
They can think it's all he has.

2558
03:07:51,300 --> 03:07:56,180
Alright, I'll All right, I'll grab this too.

2559
03:07:58,460 --> 03:08:00,120
Please, let him have this.

2560
03:08:08,630 --> 03:08:08,890
Nice.

2561
03:08:10,750 --> 03:08:12,610
Oh, I had a...

2562
03:08:12,610 --> 03:08:13,390
Got attachment.

2563
03:08:13,730 --> 03:08:14,350
Let's go.

2564
03:08:18,090 --> 03:08:20,170
Look, I know that they're dead.

2565
03:08:20,210 --> 03:08:24,090
Look, they're all dead, but I still want to use it.

2566
03:08:29,770 --> 03:08:30,850
Oh, it's this.

2567
03:08:32,090 --> 03:08:32,650
Oh, yay!

2568
03:08:32,810 --> 03:08:33,510
More rage.

2569
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:38,040
That's good.

2570
03:08:39,820 --> 03:08:41,800
Daddy has more anger problems.

2571
03:08:45,140 --> 03:08:45,600
Yay!

2572
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:46,980
Anger issues.

2573
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:48,200
Let's go, son.

2574
03:08:50,500 --> 03:08:53,360
I have no outlet, so I'm going to take it out on these
people.

2575
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:55,520
Good thing you learned the runes, brother.

2576
03:08:56,060 --> 03:08:57,700
Yeah, good thing I'm worried!

2577
03:09:00,420 --> 03:09:00,880
I'm worried!

2578
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:02,200
Oh, I guess not.

2579
03:09:06,300 --> 03:09:07,940
It's like, oh, check it out.

2580
03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:10,100
And I was like, what did I learn?

2581
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:15,580
There's nothing inside that head.

2582
03:09:17,020 --> 03:09:19,540
I guess that's nothing, I guess.

2583
03:09:20,120 --> 03:09:21,240
I guess that's everything there.

2584
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:22,380
Want to get going?

2585
03:09:25,140 --> 03:09:27,440
I learned to read not right.

2586
03:09:27,740 --> 03:09:30,000
Oh, yeah, it was one step at a time, guys.

2587
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:32,680
step out of time.

2588
03:09:33,640 --> 03:09:37,400
I unfortunately did not learn how to fucking write.

2589
03:09:43,270 --> 03:09:43,850
Was this just loot?

2590
03:09:45,650 --> 03:09:47,310
Oh, I guess loot and achievement.

2591
03:09:49,890 --> 03:09:49,970
Bruh.

2592
03:09:50,210 --> 03:09:51,390
Mesa, thank you for the super chat.

2593
03:09:51,590 --> 03:09:51,710
Thank you.

2594
03:09:52,310 --> 03:09:52,790
Oh,

2595
03:09:58,000 --> 03:09:58,320
wait.

2596
03:09:58,400 --> 03:09:59,440
There's a fish here.

2597
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:02,260
Loki, grab that fish.

2598
03:10:03,860 --> 03:10:04,280
Grab it.

2599
03:10:04,820 --> 03:10:05,720
Wait, where did it go?

2600
03:10:06,900 --> 03:10:07,160
Wait.

2601
03:10:07,220 --> 03:10:07,800
What?

2602
03:10:07,940 --> 03:10:08,920
The fish is gone.

2603
03:10:09,360 --> 03:10:10,220
Oh, there it is.

2604
03:10:10,560 --> 03:10:11,280
Loki, grab it.

2605
03:10:12,740 --> 03:10:13,060
Fish.

2606
03:10:14,180 --> 03:10:14,880
Oh, my God.

2607
03:10:15,080 --> 03:10:15,840
It's gone again.

2608
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:17,140
Oh, my God.

2609
03:10:17,280 --> 03:10:18,340
What's the point, son?

2610
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:19,580
Boy.

2611
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:24,460
Boy, you had one job.

2612
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:32,040
Down I go.

2613
03:10:34,260 --> 03:10:34,780
My boy.

2614
03:10:37,300 --> 03:10:39,680
Why did you not catch the fish, boy?

2615
03:10:39,680 --> 03:10:42,040
I feel

2616
03:10:45,140 --> 03:10:46,780
like we're gonna miss a lot of things here.

2617
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:53,020
It seems Atreus, you intend to recruit here as an ally for
war.

2618
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:56,380
I just... I'm trying to keep our options open.

2619
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:58,920
Let's just keep moving.

2620
03:10:59,720 --> 03:11:00,440
I'm glad we're out here.

2621
03:11:00,840 --> 03:11:01,820
Exploring a new realm.

2622
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:04,580
Maybe we could just try to enjoy the war.

2623
03:11:04,580 --> 03:11:05,340
No more snow.

2624
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:07,960
I mean, hey, that's good.

2625
03:11:09,460 --> 03:11:11,500
We don't have to deal with snow.

2626
03:11:12,780 --> 03:11:19,140
i don't know if i like this room we gotta find a way to open
that gate if we want to get to neither of them i think it's

2627
03:11:19,140 --> 03:11:31,120
because i have to row a boat i hate the i hate rowing boats
all right go it's too fast then how should we catch it yeah

2628
03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:34,480
flank it attack from behind attack from behind

2629
03:11:40,620 --> 03:11:42,720
oh like here oh

2630
03:11:47,560 --> 03:11:49,240
Wait, I'll freeze it.

2631
03:11:50,320 --> 03:11:50,720
BAM!

2632
03:11:51,540 --> 03:11:52,240
There we go.

2633
03:11:53,200 --> 03:11:54,040
What is that?

2634
03:11:56,240 --> 03:11:57,980
Okay, I don't know.

2635
03:12:00,300 --> 03:12:01,800
Oh, it's... Oh, it's loot!

2636
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:03,780
Yeah!

2637
03:12:04,340 --> 03:12:04,560
Loot!

2638
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:06,260
Loot, loot, loot.

2639
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,720
It was the last of the species, but I got loot, though.

2640
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:11,920
Father, up there.

2641
03:12:16,020 --> 03:12:16,720
I'm well.

2642
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:18,980
Oh, up there!

2643
03:12:25,110 --> 03:12:25,910
Is it with that?

2644
03:12:26,070 --> 03:12:26,390
No.

2645
03:12:27,590 --> 03:12:30,110
Oh, I guess I have to get like a prompt or some shit.

2646
03:12:33,390 --> 03:12:37,330
There's like an endangered species and I fucking like killed
it for loot.

2647
03:12:38,330 --> 03:12:40,410
Because it was an exotic animal.

2648
03:12:41,210 --> 03:12:41,650
Halfway there.

2649
03:12:42,330 --> 03:12:44,670
There's gotta be another chain to lower the rest of the
gate.

2650
03:12:48,550 --> 03:12:49,210
Is there?

2651
03:12:49,930 --> 03:12:50,570
Oh, there is.

2652
03:12:50,810 --> 03:12:51,790
Wait, what's over here?

2653
03:12:53,510 --> 03:12:54,630
Okay, I have to go this way.

2654
03:12:54,730 --> 03:12:56,110
I'm not... my legs aren't strong enough.

2655
03:12:58,030 --> 03:12:59,990
My thighs aren't strong enough for this.

2656
03:13:03,450 --> 03:13:03,930
Whoa!

2657
03:13:04,170 --> 03:13:05,510
Oh shit, he's too fast.

2658
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:06,430
It's okay.

2659
03:13:07,070 --> 03:13:08,230
Can't dodge this!

2660
03:13:10,790 --> 03:13:11,550
That's right!

2661
03:13:16,150 --> 03:13:16,630
Bam!

2662
03:13:19,030 --> 03:13:19,730
Chop chop!

2663
03:13:19,930 --> 03:13:20,650
Good hit, brother.

2664
03:13:21,910 --> 03:13:23,010
Wait, there's one more.

2665
03:13:24,090 --> 03:13:25,030
There we go.

2666
03:13:29,010 --> 03:13:29,970
Juggling time.

2667
03:13:32,110 --> 03:13:32,870
There we go.

2668
03:13:33,670 --> 03:13:33,670
Easy.

2669
03:13:35,070 --> 03:13:37,790
Yeah, I don't have the thunder thighs to make that jump.

2670
03:13:39,870 --> 03:13:42,310
You can tell I worked more on my arms than my legs.

2671
03:13:44,290 --> 03:13:46,710
I think you can uncover that geyser from here.

2672
03:13:48,190 --> 03:13:48,550
Yep.

2673
03:13:50,230 --> 03:13:50,670
Easy.

2674
03:13:52,590 --> 03:13:55,350
Alright, that should boost it up.

2675
03:13:57,330 --> 03:13:58,750
Oh, wait, no, I do it here.

2676
03:13:59,810 --> 03:14:00,830
And then we fix it.

2677
03:14:03,270 --> 03:14:04,490
Oh, I think I get it.

2678
03:14:05,110 --> 03:14:07,150
If you freeze the geyser, the pressure will turn the wheel.

2679
03:14:09,070 --> 03:14:09,610
Yes, boy.

2680
03:14:10,750 --> 03:14:11,190
Yes.

2681
03:14:12,950 --> 03:14:14,090
Good job, boy.

2682
03:14:15,270 --> 03:14:16,730
You understand now.

2683
03:14:21,160 --> 03:14:21,820
Oh, okay.

2684
03:14:22,160 --> 03:14:28,370
understand okay so i have to time it

2685
03:14:39,580 --> 03:14:42,030
look there's a chain we can pull up there

2686
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:56,880
how give me a sec do i should i understand though i
understand though but give me a sec Do you know?

2687
03:14:57,380 --> 03:14:58,840
I understand though.

2688
03:15:11,980 --> 03:15:12,420
Wait,

2689
03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:21,920
I understand though.

2690
03:15:28,340 --> 03:15:29,220
Watch this.

2691
03:15:35,460 --> 03:15:38,740
There's still the other chain to pull, but how are we gonna
get to it?

2692
03:15:50,600 --> 03:15:52,320
I still don't see how we can get up to that chain.

2693
03:15:52,920 --> 03:15:53,800
It's wish.

2694
03:15:54,320 --> 03:15:56,260
Shoot, let me uh...

2695
03:15:56,260 --> 03:15:57,580
Let me cook, boy.

2696
03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:00,080
Let me cook, boy.

2697
03:16:01,740 --> 03:16:02,560
Let me cook!

2698
03:16:24,090 --> 03:16:24,650
Oh!

2699
03:16:30,760 --> 03:16:32,680
I understand, though.

2700
03:16:36,910 --> 03:16:37,230
Okay.

2701
03:16:43,850 --> 03:16:44,450
Okay.

2702
03:16:44,950 --> 03:16:46,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2703
03:17:05,070 --> 03:17:06,090
There we go!

2704
03:17:06,290 --> 03:17:06,690
Look at that!

2705
03:17:06,710 --> 03:17:21,030
I told you I told you I understand I told you I just don't
look up okay that's my only problem I just need to start

2706
03:17:21,030 --> 03:17:35,190
looking up yeah as I just have to start looking up and then
everything will go well you should collect any others you

2707
03:17:37,330 --> 03:17:38,670
What the fuck?

2708
03:17:38,950 --> 03:17:39,890
Fucking pull the chain.

2709
03:17:41,670 --> 03:17:42,890
Oh, I guess spamming it.

2710
03:17:42,930 --> 03:17:44,250
I keep thinking like if I press...

2711
03:17:44,250 --> 03:17:46,950
I was like, smashed Otis, the troll.

2712
03:17:47,910 --> 03:17:49,470
I keep thinking that for some reason.

2713
03:17:49,650 --> 03:17:53,850
If I may, what exactly are you hoping to learn from Tia?

2714
03:17:54,530 --> 03:17:58,890
Well, like I said, I was hoping he could tell me something
about Loki.

2715
03:18:00,350 --> 03:18:02,270
Yeah, who the fuck is Loki?

2716
03:18:03,230 --> 03:18:04,550
Traveling to other lands.

2717
03:18:05,510 --> 03:18:07,670
Yeah, he's supposed to save the world.

2718
03:18:07,870 --> 03:18:08,770
Where the fuck is he?

2719
03:18:08,950 --> 03:18:09,430
Back in the day.

2720
03:18:11,090 --> 03:18:12,570
Just for the history, obviously.

2721
03:18:14,630 --> 03:18:18,650
Let's hope Tears in a talkative mood after being imprisoned
for so long.

2722
03:18:19,430 --> 03:18:23,750
Not all of Odin's captives can be as charmingly voluble as
myself.

2723
03:18:24,410 --> 03:18:26,890
We have no proof Tears truly here.

2724
03:18:27,590 --> 03:18:27,910
Right.

2725
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:35,460
I mean, this is a nice vacation spot if he is here.

2726
03:18:35,720 --> 03:18:36,700
That earthquake earlier.

2727
03:18:36,940 --> 03:18:38,040
Better than the snow.

2728
03:18:38,920 --> 03:18:42,980
It's unlikely, but geological disturbances tend to be
unpredictable.

2729
03:18:45,640 --> 03:18:46,800
If the geysers and...

2730
03:18:46,800 --> 03:18:49,260
There's so many campsites and where are the campers?

2731
03:18:49,480 --> 03:18:50,280
Or worse because of fumble winter.

2732
03:18:51,660 --> 03:18:52,800
Maybe the earthquakes are too?

2733
03:18:53,380 --> 03:18:53,680
Aye.

2734
03:18:54,240 --> 03:18:55,700
You might be on to something, lad.

2735
03:18:56,180 --> 03:18:59,020
Oh, so... Yeah, it is like global warming.

2736
03:19:00,180 --> 03:19:02,180
So they're getting more earthquakes instead of snow.

2737
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:04,340
Oh, they're the campers.

2738
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:05,740
Truly, they're friendly.

2739
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:07,680
Hello!

2740
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:10,800
Friendly?

2741
03:19:12,060 --> 03:19:13,460
Are you friendly?

2742
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:14,520
Hey!

2743
03:19:16,500 --> 03:19:17,880
Don't point at them.

2744
03:19:18,120 --> 03:19:18,640
That's rude.

2745
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:21,560
They're running away.

2746
03:19:21,740 --> 03:19:22,780
Yeah, why are they running away?

2747
03:19:23,900 --> 03:19:24,360
Hello!

2748
03:19:24,680 --> 03:19:25,560
Are you friendly?

2749
03:19:28,400 --> 03:19:30,100
I'm just a tourist.

2750
03:19:32,400 --> 03:19:34,740
Just a humble tourist.

2751
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:36,000
Why would that for us though?

2752
03:19:38,940 --> 03:19:40,380
Oh, why did I just run away?

2753
03:19:41,640 --> 03:19:43,260
Is it because I'm tall?

2754
03:19:43,640 --> 03:19:44,140
Stay alert.

2755
03:19:45,540 --> 03:19:45,920
Oh, shit.

2756
03:19:46,160 --> 03:19:47,440
Yeah, they stayed through the alarm.

2757
03:19:47,820 --> 03:19:49,740
Bro, I'm just on a fucking boat.

2758
03:19:50,720 --> 03:19:53,360
You do not need an alarm for this, guys.

2759
03:19:53,660 --> 03:19:55,600
Look at my dingy-ass boat.

2760
03:19:57,840 --> 03:20:00,160
Like, how is this a threat to anyone?

2761
03:20:03,920 --> 03:20:06,320
Have they never seen a tall person before?

2762
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:11,340
Are they that?

2763
03:20:11,640 --> 03:20:12,960
Is it like...

2764
03:20:12,960 --> 03:20:15,020
Hey, could we talk to you for...

2765
03:20:15,020 --> 03:20:15,960
Are they like...

2766
03:20:15,960 --> 03:20:16,100
Oh.

2767
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:20,860
Are they just like trapped in this world and never travel to
different worlds?

2768
03:20:23,760 --> 03:20:25,520
Come on, friendly.

2769
03:20:26,900 --> 03:20:27,980
Wait, there's a raven.

2770
03:20:31,480 --> 03:20:32,360
Where are you?

2771
03:20:34,780 --> 03:20:36,560
Hello, little people.

2772
03:20:36,840 --> 03:20:38,300
I am very friendly.

2773
03:20:40,040 --> 03:20:41,960
I hear Odin's ravens.

2774
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:47,080
The detail in the woodwork is quite extraordinary.

2775
03:20:48,600 --> 03:20:51,340
Oh, there must be like a magic, specific magic thing for
this.

2776
03:20:51,780 --> 03:20:52,940
That's why it's green.

2777
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:55,220
Oh, hey.

2778
03:20:55,540 --> 03:20:57,180
Oh, wait, you have money in the pot.

2779
03:20:57,300 --> 03:20:58,120
I fucking knew it.

2780
03:20:58,360 --> 03:20:59,240
Sell the rules.

2781
03:21:03,460 --> 03:21:04,420
What does that mean?

2782
03:21:04,560 --> 03:21:04,780
Yeah.

2783
03:21:05,140 --> 03:21:06,000
What can I kill?

2784
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:14,460
Yes, I can.

2785
03:21:17,440 --> 03:21:18,780
Is that a statue of Odin?

2786
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:20,100
Oh, shit.

2787
03:21:20,320 --> 03:21:20,880
We love him here.

2788
03:21:21,100 --> 03:21:21,720
Oh, for you.

2789
03:21:23,760 --> 03:21:24,460
It's okay.

2790
03:21:24,520 --> 03:21:25,780
We won't tell them who we are.

2791
03:21:26,840 --> 03:21:27,160
Yeah.

2792
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:31,800
Or is this a bad time to tell you guys I have not eaten
anything at all?

2793
03:21:33,460 --> 03:21:36,240
I just woke up and went straight to stream.

2794
03:21:39,980 --> 03:21:43,880
Now I see the chicken and I'm like, me hungry.

2795
03:21:52,390 --> 03:21:54,630
Let's see, I did have a little snack.

2796
03:21:55,870 --> 03:21:57,070
When I went to get water.

2797
03:21:58,610 --> 03:22:00,430
Wait, is Sindri is here?

2798
03:22:02,650 --> 03:22:04,070
What the fuck?

2799
03:22:04,850 --> 03:22:07,870
Oh, it's because I'm busy collecting all...

2800
03:22:07,870 --> 03:22:09,210
Oh, I have a shopping list.

2801
03:22:10,570 --> 03:22:11,190
Okay.

2802
03:22:12,030 --> 03:22:13,670
I need a barrel of bro.

2803
03:22:13,930 --> 03:22:24,430
Okay, I'm not fucking shopping for you Bro, I am not I'm not
your fucking like Uber Eats order

2804
03:22:28,210 --> 03:22:30,030
What is it?

2805
03:22:30,710 --> 03:22:31,590
What is this injury?

2806
03:22:32,930 --> 03:22:34,550
What is a dwarf?

2807
03:22:35,430 --> 03:22:37,750
Whoa Oh bird flu fuss.

2808
03:22:37,770 --> 03:22:38,250
Thank you.

2809
03:22:38,510 --> 03:22:40,310
Thank you.

2810
03:22:40,310 --> 03:22:45,690
I appreciate it Oh, if these cobblestones could talk.

2811
03:22:46,210 --> 03:22:47,930
Oh my god, there's a lot of green rocks.

2812
03:22:48,150 --> 03:22:48,930
Then they'd have mouths.

2813
03:22:49,830 --> 03:22:50,750
Uber loot.

2814
03:22:51,690 --> 03:22:52,690
Filthy, disgusting mouths.

2815
03:22:55,570 --> 03:22:56,850
Do you mind if I fiddle with your bow?

2816
03:22:57,490 --> 03:22:57,790
What?

2817
03:23:00,990 --> 03:23:04,450
That bow is, like, not special at all.

2818
03:23:04,730 --> 03:23:07,050
You are long overdue for our replacement.

2819
03:23:09,630 --> 03:23:12,550
Taking advantage of certain material...

2820
03:23:12,550 --> 03:23:12,730
Ow.

2821
03:23:13,970 --> 03:23:20,790
structural sensitivity to sonic vibrations has been
something I've been meaning to try for quite some time now

2822
03:23:20,790 --> 03:23:35,290
thanks for finally trying it what's it gonna be this time
yeah patience I find it's best to see these things oh in

2823
03:23:35,290 --> 03:23:36,390
action ah

2824
03:23:41,190 --> 03:23:54,170
whoo oh there there's the power of green now take aim at
that gate there but before you loose say ski alpha ski alpha

2825
03:23:57,050 --> 03:23:59,310

2826
03:24:03,140 --> 03:24:20,160
oh oh shit how was i supposed to know they were there okay
that's fine it's fine I'll be angry.

2827
03:24:20,460 --> 03:24:21,020
It's fine.

2828
03:24:21,820 --> 03:24:23,940
Snap dunk that fucking salamander.

2829
03:24:24,900 --> 03:24:25,180
Whoa!

2830
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:27,560
It's not overkill.

2831
03:24:28,740 --> 03:24:30,760
I'm so mad.

2832
03:24:31,420 --> 03:24:32,040
Okay, it's fine.

2833
03:24:32,300 --> 03:24:34,400
Okay, so, Darylyn.

2834
03:24:36,300 --> 03:24:38,480
All right, let's go upgrade our blades, actually.

2835
03:24:38,780 --> 03:24:39,820
Any idea where the tavern is?

2836
03:24:40,140 --> 03:24:40,420
Oh.

2837
03:24:40,660 --> 03:24:42,480
I don't think we need one.

2838
03:24:42,860 --> 03:24:43,500
Filthy tavern.

2839
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:46,760
The sewer you just punched the hole through seems promising,
though.

2840
03:24:49,140 --> 03:24:51,220
Oh, I don't have a chaos for them.

2841
03:24:51,500 --> 03:24:54,040
It's not like you're able to open other doors around here.

2842
03:24:55,880 --> 03:24:57,840
I might as well upgrade this for now.

2843
03:24:58,920 --> 03:24:59,200
Does it work?

2844
03:24:59,320 --> 03:25:01,720
Oh, I should have asked you guys if it's worth fucking
upgrading.

2845
03:25:02,140 --> 03:25:03,600
Mara King, thank you again for this super chat.

2846
03:25:03,840 --> 03:25:04,980
Thank you, thank you.

2847
03:25:05,700 --> 03:25:06,820
I really appreciate it.

2848
03:25:06,940 --> 03:25:08,060
This realm is so firm.

2849
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:10,420
Any outsider is considered a threat.

2850
03:25:11,020 --> 03:25:12,580
Sounds like an organism if I ever had one.

2851
03:25:16,400 --> 03:25:19,620
Uh, silently beaming food into your brain until you order
food.

2852
03:25:19,640 --> 03:25:26,860
hot dog with mustard hamburger oh i want hot pot so bad i've

like i can archer this All right, shoot that.

2855
03:25:54,920 --> 03:25:56,640
Now it's time to rob them.

2856
03:25:57,680 --> 03:25:59,940
That's why they're scared of the tall ones.

2857
03:26:01,360 --> 03:26:05,300
That's why I'm justifying their prejudice against tall
people.

2858
03:26:06,860 --> 03:26:08,920
Literally came over here to rob them.

2859
03:26:10,020 --> 03:26:10,960
How hungry.

2860
03:26:13,160 --> 03:26:14,540
All right, let's see.

2861
03:26:16,640 --> 03:26:17,600
We go this way.

2862
03:26:18,600 --> 03:26:19,120
Oh, wait.

2863
03:26:19,980 --> 03:26:35,480
shoot that bird wait that bird's invincible but he's green
but the crow is green best of luck any outsider is

2864
03:26:35,480 --> 03:26:43,340
considered a threat is that to protect the dwarfs it sounds
like wait do I have the power of green or going back your

2865
03:26:43,340 --> 03:26:49,560
motive wait I thought like I have to hit like he's green so
I have to hit him of green.

2866
03:26:50,540 --> 03:26:51,480
Alright, that's right.

2867
03:26:51,620 --> 03:26:52,840
You thought that's right.

2868
03:26:52,920 --> 03:26:53,580
Get baited.

2869
03:26:55,220 --> 03:26:55,600
There we go.

2870
03:26:57,960 --> 03:26:59,320
I started the favor.

2871
03:27:01,240 --> 03:27:03,500
Alright, I'm gonna ask that bird a little question.

2872
03:27:06,460 --> 03:27:08,500
There can only be one bird.

2873
03:27:08,740 --> 03:27:09,600
Bird Royale.

2874
03:27:09,720 --> 03:27:12,100
Well, everyone's hiding on this side, too.

2875
03:27:12,480 --> 03:27:15,600
Odin's occupation of this realm has its hooks in deep.

2876
03:27:16,480 --> 03:27:17,500
Left or right?

2877
03:27:18,660 --> 03:27:19,020
I'll go.

2878
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:19,400
Oh, right.

2879
03:27:20,660 --> 03:27:21,300
Why hide?

2880
03:27:21,800 --> 03:27:23,460
Resist and you made an example of.

2881
03:27:23,800 --> 03:27:24,980
To keep the rest in line.

2882
03:27:25,760 --> 03:27:29,260
Self-preservation can outweigh bravery for even the
strongest of folk.

2883
03:27:30,140 --> 03:27:31,980
Fear keeps them safe and alive.

2884
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:36,820
Yeah, it's a bird eat bird world.

2885
03:27:38,980 --> 03:27:41,160
Maybe we can try knocking on some doors for directions.

2886
03:27:41,800 --> 03:27:43,640
I don't think they're gonna answer.

2887
03:27:44,540 --> 03:27:47,000
Aim at the ore and then sonic arrow.

2888
03:27:47,220 --> 03:27:47,620
Oh, these?

2889
03:27:48,320 --> 03:27:48,960
Oh!

2890
03:27:49,800 --> 03:27:51,000
But we're looking for...

2891
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:52,100
Nothing for you here.

2892
03:27:52,640 --> 03:27:53,960
I don't care what you want.

2893
03:27:54,560 --> 03:27:55,120
No food.

2894
03:27:55,540 --> 03:27:56,640
No encouraging word.

2895
03:27:57,060 --> 03:27:57,600
No nothing.

2896
03:27:58,200 --> 03:27:58,520
Damn.

2897
03:28:00,360 --> 03:28:01,220
That's fucking right.

2898
03:28:02,980 --> 03:28:03,920
That's what you deserve.

2899
03:28:04,980 --> 03:28:05,860
Talking to them.

2900
03:28:08,380 --> 03:28:10,260
Is there anything extra here?

2901
03:28:12,440 --> 03:28:16,080
I always feel like when I see this, there's like a hidden
item somewhere.

2902
03:28:17,240 --> 03:28:17,600
It's like, why?

2903
03:28:17,620 --> 03:28:21,260
else would these be here wait

2904
03:28:28,680 --> 03:28:33,280
that's something okay not i guess that's not something

2905
03:28:37,880 --> 03:28:43,680
oh my god we're like we're like like this door-to-door
salesman

2906
03:28:50,640 --> 03:28:54,580
he's like hello hello

2907
03:28:59,960 --> 03:29:00,260
I don't know.

2908
03:29:00,400 --> 03:29:00,720
I don't know.

2909
03:29:01,520 --> 03:29:04,920
It's a book of America a long, long time ago.

2910
03:29:05,440 --> 03:29:05,740
Hello.

2911
03:29:05,900 --> 03:29:05,960
Hello.

2912
03:29:05,960 --> 03:29:06,800
It's like a house.

2913
03:29:07,680 --> 03:29:09,980
If he's here, maybe you should let me do the talking.

2914
03:29:10,240 --> 03:29:11,820
Oh, should not have taken that.

2915
03:29:11,860 --> 03:29:13,120
We don't want to intimidate him.

2916
03:29:13,780 --> 03:29:16,460
As you accepted Kratos as your dad and savior?

2917
03:29:17,060 --> 03:29:17,420
Hello.

2918
03:29:18,220 --> 03:29:19,060
None taken.

2919
03:29:20,040 --> 03:29:21,400
All right, talk to him.

2920
03:29:22,440 --> 03:29:23,060
Knock, knock.

2921
03:29:25,300 --> 03:29:26,280
I think that's him.

2922
03:29:26,340 --> 03:29:27,080
Is that the tavern?

2923
03:29:28,280 --> 03:29:29,820
Oh, he's not scared of me.

2924
03:29:29,960 --> 03:29:41,780
hello why are you not scared I'm taller than you apparently
there are intruders about I oh really who could it be us I

2925
03:29:41,780 --> 03:29:50,260
think yeah well if you're planning on killing me at least
let me finish this song that alarm wasn't just the perfect

2926
03:29:50,260 --> 03:29:58,640
key we're just looking for a friend of ours named Dirlin
well we both know that's not true Dirlin's got no friends

2927
03:29:58,640 --> 03:30:00,420
left Whoa!

2928
03:30:00,920 --> 03:30:03,000
If that's all you need, head out the back way there.

2929
03:30:03,620 --> 03:30:05,780
And you'll see the safety office just across the river.

2930
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:06,840
That's fucked up.

2931
03:30:06,900 --> 03:30:07,680
What did he do?

2932
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:09,220
Just don't go making trouble for the rest of us.

2933
03:30:10,720 --> 03:30:15,160
And while you travel through this realm, maybe you could
clean up the head's mess.

2934
03:30:15,900 --> 03:30:16,660
What mess?

2935
03:30:16,700 --> 03:30:17,160
What mess?

2936
03:30:17,560 --> 03:30:18,000
Later, brother.

2937
03:30:18,960 --> 03:30:19,400
What?

2938
03:30:19,720 --> 03:30:20,760
What did he do?

2939
03:30:21,720 --> 03:30:23,420
I wish to hear of this.

2940
03:30:23,640 --> 03:30:24,040
Yeah.

2941
03:30:24,700 --> 03:30:26,200
The rig's in the bay.

2942
03:30:26,820 --> 03:30:29,220
Why don't you ask the condescending skull?

2943
03:30:29,220 --> 03:30:29,860
Head.

2944
03:30:30,500 --> 03:30:31,180
I've got skin.

2945
03:30:32,160 --> 03:30:32,760
But he's right.

2946
03:30:33,380 --> 03:30:34,220
I made a mistake.

2947
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:36,440
I'd have us shut them down.

2948
03:30:39,060 --> 03:30:41,120
In service of Asgard.

2949
03:30:41,800 --> 03:30:42,960
What did you do, bro?

2950
03:30:43,060 --> 03:30:44,080
You're just ahead.

2951
03:30:45,240 --> 03:30:47,980
Shut down the mining rigs?

2952
03:30:48,660 --> 03:30:50,320
I don't want to do that.

2953
03:30:53,080 --> 03:30:54,640
Oh, is that the Games Composer?

2954
03:30:55,600 --> 03:30:56,480
Oh, that's cool.

2955
03:30:57,040 --> 03:30:58,340
That's a neat little cameo.

2956
03:31:02,520 --> 03:31:06,240
Wait, does that mean, like, it's this way for the mining
stuff?

2957
03:31:08,560 --> 03:31:10,060
Or it's before he was just ahead.

2958
03:31:10,180 --> 03:31:10,780
I was like, what the fuck?

2959
03:31:10,940 --> 03:31:11,860
How did you do all that?

2960
03:31:12,340 --> 03:31:14,120
How did you set up a mining operation?

2961
03:31:14,520 --> 03:31:15,440
You're just ahead.

2962
03:31:19,700 --> 03:31:20,820
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

2963
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:21,460
Thank you, thank you.

2964
03:31:21,540 --> 03:31:26,060
Hello, would you like to learn more about my Lord and
Savior, Tokey Bear?

2965
03:31:26,420 --> 03:31:28,540
Thank you, the super chat.

2966
03:31:28,720 --> 03:31:29,320
Thank you, thank you.

2967
03:31:29,560 --> 03:31:30,740
Here, please be careful.

2968
03:31:33,300 --> 03:31:40,840

very useful you'll be able to find anything your heart

2969
03:31:40,840 --> 03:31:46,880

locations your father and you decide and plot to travel

2970
03:31:46,880 --> 03:31:59,680
together ah it's my tracker it is my yellow pain but a
beautiful compass now scamper off all right okay

2974
03:32:57,320 --> 03:32:58,360
Excuse me?

2975
03:32:59,580 --> 03:33:00,540
I swear to God, guys.

2976
03:33:00,800 --> 03:33:02,400
I am absolutely pressing circle.

2977
03:33:02,740 --> 03:33:03,920
I swear to God.

2978
03:33:04,940 --> 03:33:05,300
Hello?

2979
03:33:10,410 --> 03:33:11,430
Oh, my God.

2980
03:33:11,570 --> 03:33:13,550
It requires me to do a tutorial.

2981
03:33:14,390 --> 03:33:15,270
Oh, that's why.

2982
03:33:15,310 --> 03:33:16,290
Okay, that makes sense.

2983
03:33:16,410 --> 03:33:18,110
I was like, why am I...

2984
03:33:18,110 --> 03:33:20,310
Why is it preventing me?

2985
03:33:22,590 --> 03:33:23,230
Oh, my God.

2986
03:33:23,270 --> 03:33:24,510
I finally have the golden...

2987
03:33:24,510 --> 03:33:25,650
I finally have a compass.

2988
03:33:26,410 --> 03:33:27,610
A boat cannot be far.

2989
03:33:30,010 --> 03:33:30,450
Huh.

2990
03:33:31,150 --> 03:33:34,230
Really, your Sindhu made it sound like Darlene was some sort
of rebellion leader.

2991
03:33:35,050 --> 03:33:36,590
Doesn't sound like anyone's following him.

2992
03:33:36,790 --> 03:33:39,330
Was being the key word to your little brother.

2993
03:33:39,410 --> 03:33:40,630
Yeah, he has no friends now.

2994
03:33:42,030 --> 03:33:43,410
He's just some crazy guy.

2995
03:33:44,530 --> 03:33:46,230
And no one wants to listen to.

2996
03:33:51,830 --> 03:33:52,270
Yeah.

2997
03:33:53,110 --> 03:33:54,370
Let's set this up.

2998
03:33:59,460 --> 03:34:00,380
Alright, nice.

2999
03:34:00,500 --> 03:34:01,480
Okay, I'm still there.

3000
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:01,800
Oh!

3001
03:34:02,440 --> 03:34:04,520
where I'm currently locked, okay?

3002
03:34:05,380 --> 03:34:07,860
But at least I have fast travel now.

3003
03:34:08,540 --> 03:34:10,020
Oh my gosh, more boats.

3004
03:34:10,420 --> 03:34:12,320
Alright, I think this is a good time to stop.

3005
03:34:14,520 --> 03:34:16,540
I'm feeling more boat travel.

3006
03:34:17,100 --> 03:34:19,240
Wait, actually, is there...

3007
03:34:19,240 --> 03:34:20,140
Will I be here?

3008
03:34:21,060 --> 03:34:23,500
I don't want to roll my boat right now.

3009
03:34:27,480 --> 03:34:32,120
I also don't want to overdo it because I am sick, so I want
to give myself more time.

3010
03:34:32,140 --> 03:34:33,880
Time to recover.

3011
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:35,980
But it's been fun so far.

3012
03:34:36,200 --> 03:34:37,560
I've been enjoying...

3013
03:34:37,560 --> 03:34:42,820
I've been enjoying the gameplay and the story so far.

3014
03:34:43,240 --> 03:34:45,720
It's really, really, really about gently down the stream.

3015
03:34:46,160 --> 03:34:47,820
So I really don't want to overdo it.

3016
03:34:48,540 --> 03:34:52,540
Really don't want to overdo the stream.

3017
03:34:52,680 --> 03:34:53,640
Because I am still sick.

3018
03:34:53,980 --> 03:34:55,840
And I want to have time to recover.

3019
03:34:56,180 --> 03:34:57,540
And also grab food.

3020
03:34:58,020 --> 03:35:01,860
But thank you all for watching Part 1 of God of War.

3021
03:35:02,140 --> 03:35:04,560
I hope I remember my controls.

3022
03:35:06,320 --> 03:35:08,580
But also, like...

3023
03:35:08,580 --> 03:35:08,980
Okay.

3024
03:35:09,840 --> 03:35:13,580
I want to know, like, would it take me here?

3025
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:19,660
I hope it doesn't, like, go take me all the way back to the
beginning.

3026
03:35:20,200 --> 03:35:23,480
I don't know where the auto saves are, technically, for
this.

3027
03:35:24,140 --> 03:35:26,500
I'm very confused where it's saving me.

3028
03:35:26,560 --> 03:35:28,100
So I hope it takes me here.

3029
03:35:28,360 --> 03:35:30,560
I hope I'll be here when I come back.

3030
03:35:30,940 --> 03:35:32,060
So we'll see you.

3031
03:35:32,140 --> 03:35:41,420
we'll see how it goes uh but great start to god of war i did
save it i just saved it don't worry guys i'll save it again

3032
03:35:41,420 --> 03:35:50,860
just to be more paranoid uh but i hope you guys enjoyed part
one of god of war uh ragnarok i'm enjoying the playthrough

3033
03:35:50,860 --> 03:35:57,980
so far i hope i remember all the controls by next
playthrough uh we are gonna do like two per week as well

3034
03:35:57,980 --> 03:36:03,660
because it is a very long game And if I feel like if I do a
one per week, I'm definitely not going to remember the

3035
03:36:03,660 --> 03:36:04,200
controls.

3036
03:36:07,440 --> 03:36:08,180
What else?

3037
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:09,800
I hope the volume was okay.

3038
03:36:09,980 --> 03:36:11,660
I will look back just to be sure.

3039
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:14,640
But if the volume needs adjusting, just let me know.

3040
03:36:14,980 --> 03:36:18,460
Was the volume okay for the playthrough?

3041
03:36:18,740 --> 03:36:20,360
Or should I adjust it more?

3042
03:36:26,360 --> 03:36:27,160
No good?

3043
03:36:27,240 --> 03:36:27,740
All right, good.

3044
03:36:27,800 --> 03:36:28,220
That's good.

3045
03:36:28,380 --> 03:36:29,100
No need to adjust.

3046
03:36:29,200 --> 03:36:29,720
Anyway, guys.

3047

Uh, but anyway, uh, tomorrow we have Metal Gear Solid with
Mint.

3053
03:37:05,300 --> 03:37:11,480
Um, I don't know if we're doing it like every week or we're
just like, like, um, every other week yet because like I

3054
03:37:11,480 --> 03:37:15,680
said, since there's two of us, we do have to like, uh, align
our schedules for it.

3055
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:17,720
But, but we do have Metal Gear Solid next week.

3056
03:37:17,960 --> 03:37:19,060
So, I'm not next week, this week.

3057
03:37:19,700 --> 03:37:24,200
Um, no, no plans yet, but whether or not we're having it
next week as well.
