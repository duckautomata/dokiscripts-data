00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,720
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,580
Woah!

3
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,380
Sorry, let me pause this video.

4
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,460
I downloaded the trailer.

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,160
Hello everybody!

6
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,420
Hello, hello!

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,780
Oh my god.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,740
I feel so relaxed right now.

9
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,220
It's been a while.

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,900
I hope you guys are okay with the low supply of vitamin doki.

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,740
It was sort of like an unplanned rest week because I did say I was like, I'm gonna take like three days off.

12
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,460
And then it ended up like I just disappeared.

13
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,600
And then Twitch was like, oh doki's having a rest week?

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,060
Time to invite her to Twitch Rivals.

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,760
And then I got invited to the Fortnite Twitch Rivals.

16
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,640
And then that stuff shit happened.

17
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,280
Oh my god, Kevlar said yes to it.

18
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,880
It was so funny.

19
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm fucking sweaty.

20
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,780
Like why am I there?

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,980
To be fair, at least like I wasn't last.

22
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,580
Like that's all that matters.

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,860
I wasn't last.

24
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,960
But yes, I feel like, I feel like super relaxed right now.

25
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,780
I don't remember how to stream at the moment.

26
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm at this, you know like when you haven't done something in a while.

27
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,680
So then you're just like, I don't like...

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,080
Doki, you were there yesterday at EVA.

29
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,760
What do you... Okay, but that's different.

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,880
I have like four other people to talk for me.

31
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,500
Um, and then so I had four other people to talk for me.

32
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,900
So it wasn't like actually streaming.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
It was just hanging out with the boys.

34
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,300
Like hanging out with the homies.

35
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:26,640
For those who don't know, because for those who don't follow me on Twitter, I really apologize that the YouTube people who don't follow me on Twitter and being like, what do you mean?

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,820
You, you were doing a watch party of EVA.

37
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,340
Um, so on Twitter, that's why you got to create a Twitter account just to follow me.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,880
Um, but I showed up at the, I guess it's sort of official watch party.

39
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,880
Um, one of the official watch parties for EVA, which was a team Brawl Pro.

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Uh, so a lot of people thought I was going to show up because they only showed like all the other members in team Brawl Pro.

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,400
So Brawl Pro, God Brawl Pro, your name is so hard to pronounce sometimes when I'm talking like, like in a moderately fast speed.

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
But, um, I'm afraid of Twitter.

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:17,760
That's why you only follow me because all I do is just retweet art, retweet merch, retweet some fans to interaction and also tweet my streams like and sponsors.

44
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,760
That's why you only follow me because there's nothing else but just doki stuff.

45
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:31,880
Uh, anyway, um, so, um, it was like sort of like a surprise guest appearance because I didn't think I was going to be there as well.

46
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,820
Um, but then like I, I messaged like, uh, the day before.

47
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,500
Because I saw, you know, everybody was like taking pictures, hanging out and everything.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,620
Um, why did I not announce that I wasn't going to EVO?

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,080
Because I didn't want to like, you know, I wanted to like sort of separate.

50
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,220
I didn't want people to sort of like know where I was type deal.

51
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,260
So that's why like I didn't say it because I know a lot of people are like, are you going to be at EVO?

52
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,840
Are you going to be at EVO?

53
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,800
If I say yes, people will try to find me.

54
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,880
If I say no, um, then like that gives a precedence of like whether or not I'm going to show up somewhere.

55
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,060
Like, you know, I'm willing to say where I'm going to show up because I don't want, I don't really like I'm, I don't really want to show up.

56
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,820
I really want like, uh, people to like approach me out of nowhere.

57
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,700
Because I'm an introvert.

58
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,660
So I feel pretty awkward about that type of situation.

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,260
So that's why I didn't say whether or not I was going to be there or not.

60
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,660
So like, like, you know, if I'm going to be somewhere, I wouldn't announce it.

61
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,660
I wouldn't say it.

62
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:40,200
That's why I never, I never, I never said like, Um, that's why I never, I never, I never said like, I never like, I don't want to like set precedence of whether or not like I'll be like, no, I won't be there.

63
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,520
And so then people assume that I'll tell people where I'm going to be next time.

64
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,560
Um, so like, that's why I was like, oh, people would be like, are you going to be there?

65
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,760
And I'm like, I can't say yes or no.

66
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,160
That's literally what I meant.

67
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,740
I can't confirm or deny.

68
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,560
But I didn't want to like, you know, be like, I wasn't going to be there.

69
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,800
Um, but it was because I had a really, I needed a break.

70
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,500
And, um, I needed to like, there was a lot of stuff going on as well.

71
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,540
So sadly I wasn't there.

72
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Uh, I wasn't there physically at EVO.

73
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:22,580
So, but I did like, uh, I did like, that doesn't mean like, uh, Seijan was really nice about it and said like, if I ever want to go anywhere, like they can use that money to fund the thing for me next time.

74
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,600
Um, because I said, unfortunately I can't make it to this year's EVO and stuff like that.

75
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,300
Um, so, uh, Seijan was incredibly nice about it.

76
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,400
And he was like, oh, don't worry.

77
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,480
If you ever want to try to go to any EVOs in the future, because they announced like three fucking EVOs.

78
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,420
Yesterday, Seijan was like, we will help fund you for that.

79
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,660
And, um, uh, like the same prize, the same prize as the like winning Seijan slam type deal.

80
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,080
So I really appreciate it.

81
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,580
He's such a nice guy, um, in general.

82
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,280
Um, but anyway, yes, I was at the, I guess it wasn't official.

83
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,800
It was an official watch party, but it was hosted on team of Brawl Pro, like Mr. Brawl Pro's channel.

84
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,280
Um, so it was me, Koni, Sly.

85
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,100
Matt and, uh, Brawl Pro.

86
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,820
We were all there just hanging out.

87
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Um, just watching.

88
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,440
I was just going to be there for Tekken.

89
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,760
Um, but, uh, but then like, you know, it was like Street Fighter was like the finals, like the last match.

90
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,720
I had no idea what was going on.

91
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,960
Um, but Street Fighter was like the last turn, like the last tournament before EVO ends.

92
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,880
And I was like, you know what?

93
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I'll stay as well.

94
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,740
Uh, so.

95
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
It was great.

96
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,860
It was a great time watching.

97
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,180
Um, um, I remember like, I haven't watched EVO in a long ass time.

98
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,800
Like I've seen like best of moments where, you know, the celebrations and stuff like that.

99
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Like people celebrating.

100
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,380
I've seen stuff, clips of that.

101
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,540
Like, um, of like the endings of EVO events, like EVO tournaments and stuff.

102
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,040
I never like, really, I haven't watched an actual like, tournaments in EVO in a long ass time.

103
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,880
Um, so it was great experiencing that again.

104
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,060
Um, and, uh, and I had a great time.

105
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,840
I had a great time with the boys and we took a picture and everything.

106
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,460
Matt was really nice.

107
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,120
Cause I asked Matt if he could like help me take a picture with everybody.

108
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,040
And then like, I called in on a lazy Matt man's phone and then like, uh, put the camera on and everything.

109
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,340
That's how we got the photo together.

110
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,460
And then we all got together and had the photo.

111
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,500
I was really happy about that.

112
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,000
Cause, um, originally, originally it was just to take a photo.

113
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,080
Um, with.

114
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,060
I just wanted to take a photo with the team because I saw everybody was having such a fun time together.

115
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,420
Um, on Twitter.

116
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,800
So I messaged, uh, I messaged Matt and BrawlPro.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,940
I messaged BrawlPro if I could take a photo with the team, um, before everything ends.

118
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,100
And then he was like, yeah, yeah, of course.

119
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,640
Uh, of course we like, of course we want to.

120
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,280
And then, so, um, that turned into like, wait, can I actually show up at the watch party?

121
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,060
And then they literally got me into the watch party the day after.

122
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:14,100
Like, um, I think like I asked the day before and then they got everything ready to set up like this, the morning of the watch party.

123
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,240
So in the morning, um, they're like, they messaged me and they added me into this big group chat with the EVO team at like the EVO technical team.

124
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,940
Um, like the people were running like EVO and stuff.

125
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,880
So they, they set the production team of EVO in a group chat with me.

126
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,980
And, um, and then like in the morning of, I had to do like a tech rehearsal.

127
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,520
Uh, because they haven't really added a YouTuber, you know, on the broadcast before.

128
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,600
I think, I think, am I, I don't know, I'm not sure.

129
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,860
I might be like, spitting words under my ass right now.

130
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:52,620
But, but like the production team didn't really, um, never really done it before.

131
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,020
So we were doing like a technical test and everything.

132
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,740
Um, and, uh, at like 11 in the morning.

133
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,220
And then after that, like I came in.

134
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,340
Um, at like, you know, at like 3pm and stuff to get ready for the watch party.

135
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,240
But it was a great time.

136
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,760
I had a, uh, had a great time.

137
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,680
And, um, it was a great experience.

138
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,540
Uh, I really love Team Brawl Pro.

139
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,780
Uh, honestly, I think it's like one of the best experiences I've had as a YouTuber in a tournament setting.

140
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,680
And, um, it was great meeting them.

141
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,460
And I'm really happy that I was able to do a watch party with them.

142
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,160
Anyway, on other news, it was so, I need to tell you guys a story.

143
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:40,620
Uh, but during my rest week, I had to do like another technical test for, uh, um, ACGHK for one of the conventions I'm doing.

144
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:48,560
And in one of the conventions, we're doing, we're, uh, I'll be playing Apex with some fans, um, during ACGHK.

145
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,660
And it was so funny because I had to do a technical test.

146
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,680
And, um, they wanted me to play a game of Apex.

147
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,040
Uh, to check the sound and everything.

148
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:09,680
And so, so, you know, it was me, the production team for the convention and the call, and my events manager.

149
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,280
So, you know, we were, they were all listening in to the gameplay.

150
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:21,200
And while I was playing in the middle of this game, the lifeline player in my team was like, Yo, Doki, you wanna, you wanna...

151
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,740
He was like, yo, Doki, you wanna, like, squad up?

152
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,620
And then I'm just like, what the fuck?

153
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,300
And I was like, well, like...

154
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,820
And then everybody was, you know, we were on top.

155
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,180
Like, we were all, like, trying to do the technical test.

156
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,180
And then, so, like, everybody heard that.

157
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,620
And then I was just like, this is so awkward.

158
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,500
And so then in the chat, I was just like, um...

159
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,420
Like, I typed out, um...

160
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,100
And then he was like, the guy in the game was like, bro, bro, trust me, I'm a fucking goaded lifeline.

161
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,340
And then everybody just laughed.

162
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,980
And then, and then, like, the production team and my event manager just laughed.

163
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,900
And then they were laughing their ass off.

164
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,840
And I'm like, bro...

165
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,130
And then I was like, I can't tell.

166
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,470
I was like, bro, I'm doing a fucking technical test right now.

167
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,410
And he was like, he doesn't know.

168
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,550
Like, the staff was, like, just laughing at him.

169
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,210
And I'm like, oh, he doesn't know.

170
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,890
It was so funny.

171
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,570
I'm like, bro, bro, not the time right now, man.

172
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,630
He lacks the critical information.

173
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,970
Um...

174
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,550
But anyway, during my rest week, um...

175
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,170
It was just some random...

176
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,190
I just bumped into some fucking random lifeline player.

177
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,970
Anyway, so...

178
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,310
Juno, the newest support, just came out.

179
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,430
Well, the testing of Juno just came out.

180
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,130
But...

181
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:12,230
Me, not being able to read, didn't realize that Juno was only available on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

182
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,790
I thought Juno was gonna be there forever.

183
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,430
I didn't realize it was just, like, a technical preview of her.

184
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,130
So I was, like, super excited.

185
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,690
Because I was like, oh, I'm gonna take a rest this...

186
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,050
Like, you know, I'm gonna take a rest.

187
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,430
And then I'll check her out after, like, rest week is over.

188
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,450
Little do I know, today is the day that she actually was officially not available to play.

189
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,010
So I never got a chance to check her out.

190
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,030
So...

191
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,890
I never read the details.

192
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,770
I was like, JUNO!

193
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,210
And then I was like, oh my god, like that movie!

194
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,270
But also...

195
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,830
Um, anyway...

196
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,390
Juno is pretty interesting.

197
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,530
Because she's basically every support combined together.

198
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,510
So a lot of people are saying that she might make Lucio obsolete.

199
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,430
Because she has a support.

200
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,870
And she has a speed boost.

201
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,130
Um...

202
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,170
And her ult is a speed, like, ult.

203
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,030
So she has, like...

204
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,950
You know, Lucio's whole thing is speed boost.

205
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,930
So that's, like, unfortunate for him.

206
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,790
Um...

207
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,250
But everybody was saying that she's really, really fun to play.

208
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,450
I'm really sad I couldn't check her out before she gets nerfed.

209
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,790
Because, you know, in the previews...

210
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,330
Um...

211
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,010
I'm pretty sure she's gonna get, like, adjusted and nerfed.

212
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,190
Before...

213
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,530
Because she's coming out next season.

214
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,430
She's coming out in August.

215
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,210
So I'm just really sad.

216
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,950
Because I really want to try her out.

217
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,710
During, like, the actual...

218
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,030
Um...

219
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,150
The actual, like, gameplay time.

220
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,170
When, like, she's, like, fresh.

221
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,150
And, um...

222
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,250
Hasn't been touched yet by devs or anything.

223
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,790
Because the devs are already saying that, like...

224
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,750
Oh, we're gonna adjust her after the technical preview.

225
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,450
So I'm a little bit sad.

226
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,970
I'm actually...

227
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,630
I'm really sad!

228
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,350
Because she must have...

229
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,410
She was gonna be the strongest she ever was.

230
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,970
Like, during the technical test.

231
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:00,910
Uh...

232
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,490
So...

233
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,250
Yeah...

234
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,050
But other than that...

235
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,610
Uh...

236
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,070
She has, like...

237
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,530
DP...

238
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:06,970
She's, like...

239
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,350
She has Ana, Lucio, Mercy, and...

240
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,410
There was something else.

241
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,450
It was, like...

242
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,330
People were saying that she has, like, Ana, Mercy, Lucio combined together.

243
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,370
Um...

244
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,270
So I thought that was incredibly interesting.

245
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,650
Um...

246
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,810
Because, like...

247
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,410
You know...

248
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,350
And that...

249
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,710
She requires aim.

250
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,750
Because you have to shoot people to heal.

251
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,850
Which is always a great thing.

252
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,210
Because, uh...

253
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,930
I like characters that has, like...

254
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,750
Skill.

255
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,650
I'm so sorry for, like...

256
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,510
If I insult anybody who plays, like...

257
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,870
The non-aiming characters.

258
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,910
But I like playing support characters that require actual skill.

259
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:44,730
Uh...

260
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,450
Because I find them just more fun.

261
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,170
Bro!

262
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,810
Lucio is so hard to aim!

263
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,790
It's literally a projectile!

264
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,630
You cannot say that!

265
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,250
Lucio was, like...

266
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:08,850
Okay.

267
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,930
You clearly played with bot Lucios who don't move.

268
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,990
Who don't even wall-ride.

269
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,770
Lucio rollouts!

270
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,450
Lucio projectiles!

271
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,810
Lucio is all about living to...

272
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,690
You gotta live to keep your team up!

273
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,010
You have good movement!

274
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,290
Anyway...

275
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,310
Um...

276
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,430
Um...

277
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,750
As I was saying...

278
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,930
As...

279
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,010
As I was...

280
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,350
As I was saying...

281
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,470
Um...

282
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,930
I would...

283
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,030
I feel like Juno seems like an incredibly fun character to play.

284
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,090
I asked one of my friends, like...

285
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,750
Cuz, like, they tried out Juno during the weekend.

286
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,430
Cuz, I was like...

287
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,170
Oh, I realized Juno's not available anymore.

288
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,830
What is Juno like?

289
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,570
And then they were telling me, like...

290
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,390
Oh yeah, like...

291
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,130
Um...

292
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,350
She's really fun to play.

293
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,530
And that she has a lot of abilities.

294
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,510
Uh...

295
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,230
She has a lot of abilities and, like...

296
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,150
To keep track of.

297
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,190
So she's gonna have a very high ceiling.

298
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,210
Um...

299
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,810
Skill ceiling.

300
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,350
Which is great!

301
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:12,830
I like that.

302
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,750
I like that some heroes have, like...

303
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,870
High skill ceilings.

304
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,590
I still...

305
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,370
Okay, like...

306
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,430
There's, like, a couple of heroes that I still have never learned.

307
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,890
Because I realized, like...

308
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,030
When they came out...

309
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,750
I realized that they were never gonna be meta in support.

310
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,530
It's the worst thing!

311
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,290
Okay...

312
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,650
Uh...

313
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,710
The biggest issue with a lot of newest support characters that they add in...

314
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,970
Other than, like, Kiriko...

315
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,590
Is that...

316
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,190
They never become meta.

317
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,390
Um...

318
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,790
Like, they never become, like, support meta.

319
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,970
Other than Kiriko.

320
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,890
So, like...

321
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,850
Life Weaver...

322
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,970
He was, like, dog shit.

323
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:47,970
Uh...

324
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,850
Baptiste...

325
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,910
Like, there were, like, other characters you could play.

326
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,170
Ilari...

327
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,830
Same there.

328
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,910
Unless you're a DPS player that just wants the DPS.

329
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,710
But then...

330
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,490
To have a good Ilari...

331
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,070
In order to make Ilari a good...

332
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,610
Uh...

333
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,190
Pick...

334
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,310
You have to have a really good...

335
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,910
Um...

336
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,590
Support partner.

337
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,530
To help keep everybody up.

338
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,930
Because Ilari is, like, half DPS...

339
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,770
Like, majority DPS and then support.

340
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,590
Um...

341
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,810
And then also, like, good...

342
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,290
Like, placement on the...

343
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,190
The pylons.

344
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,110
Um...

345
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,130
Bapt has been...

346
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,850
No, he's not...

347
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,690
He's not meta.

348
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,610
You can pick him!

349
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,770
You can pick him!

350
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,270
But he's not, like...

351
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,350
He's not, like, meta meta.

352
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,590
Like, you can pick him and it's not considered throwing.

353
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,670
Ilari is...

354
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,050
He's not meta meta.

355
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,670
Like, you can pick him but it's...

356
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,630
You're not really throwing when you're picking him.

357
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,410
But there's, like, better supports to play.

358
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,450
I feel like...

359
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,550
Because, like, I feel like...

360
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,310
Uh...

361
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,070
You know...

362
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,710
Other than...

363
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,450
Instead of playing Bap, you could play Kiriko instead.

364
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,770
Uh...

365
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,310
Due to, like, Kiriko...

366
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,690
Like, if I had to choose between Baptiste and Kiriko, I would pick Kiriko.

367
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,110
Because it's, like, similar kit.

368
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,450
Um...

369
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,730
And then I usually play Ana because Ana has been, like, fucking...

370
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,570
Like...

371
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,750
I mean, like...

372
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,570
Kiriko is better because she cleanses.

373
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:08,710
I honestly think Kiriko is, like, better because she cleanses than Bap's kit.

374
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,410
So that's why, like, if I had to choose between the two, I'll just play Kiriko.

375
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,210
Um...

376
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,710
But Ana has always been, like, hard meta for, like, a while now.

377
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,630
Um...

378
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,910
And then I play Zenyatta.

379
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,610
Yeah, Ana is always, like, top three.

380
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,690
Um...

381
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,230
Bap is also mostly, like, if your teammates are, like, incredibly W-killed.

382
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,550
Yeah.

383
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,330
Like, if they're lucky and they just wanna die, you pick Bap just for the heals.

384
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,070
Like...

385
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,870
Is there any time...

386
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,390
Like, if you have a Rein player, a Rein main, and I didn't avoid the Rein main, um...

387
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,130
Usually, people will go Bap because, like, you know, just to keep the fucking Rein alive.

388
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,010
So that's why...

389
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,570
That's why people will go Baptiste.

390
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:55,530
That's, like, literally the only time I see people pick Bap because they're, like, alright, this Reinhardt...

391
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,470
This Reinhardt wants to fucking die.

392
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,570
So I gotta pick Baptiste so, like, he doesn't do that.

393
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,530
Like...

394
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,430
Um...

395
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,930
Daisy, thank you for the super chat.

396
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,270
Thank you.

397
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:07,750
Thank you.

398
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,930
I lost a lot of faith in the hero design team since Overwatch 2 launched.

399
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,790
To be honest, most of them have been crazy OP or crazy underpowered.

400
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,870
And a lot have not been that fun.

401
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,650
Thank you for the super chat.

402
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:15,910
Thank you.

403
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,310
Thank you.

404
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,690
Apparently, Juno is very different from, like, a lot of the heroes that they released.

405
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:21,870
Um...

406
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,090
I like how, like, the day after this stream, I'm playing Marble Rivals so we can have, like, fresh comparison between the two.

407
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,970
Um...

408
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,590
Because, like, Marble Rivals is technically gonna be, like, Overwatch's competitor.

409
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,490
Even though it is third person.

410
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,470
Um...

411
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,450
So, like, we get to, like, you know, compare it directly in between the two.

412
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,090
Uh...

413
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,290
Um...

414
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,390
Anyway.

415
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,290
Uh...

416
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,190
I heard Juno was incredibly fun to play.

417
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,510
And also, like, you know, it revitalized a certain community for Overwatch.

418
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,430
So, you know, I guess it's, like, a win-win situation for everybody.

419
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,310
You know?

420
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,370
If you know, you know.

421
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,470
Alright.

422
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,310
Let's watch the trailer.

423
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,210
I watched a little bit of the trailer.

424
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:05,970
Um...

425
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,510
I heard she's, like- she works with Mei.

426
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,510
Like, in the lore...

427
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,250
Uh...

428
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,170
In the lore atmosphere, she works with- she used to work with Mei.

429
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,370
Um...

430
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,810
So, I thought that was really interesting.

431
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,830
But no one really pays attention to the Overwatch.

432
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,390
They fired the person who did the Overwatch lore.

433
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,970
So, like, I don't know what's going on anymore.

434
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:24,990
So...

435
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,010
AHAHAHA!

436
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,010
What?

437
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,510
Did they fire the head guy who did the Overwatch lore?

438
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,510
Like, um, so... I don't know what's going on anymore.

439
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,850
So I haven't been paying much attention to the lore.

440
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,710
Like, in the beginning... in the beginning, the lore was really interesting.

441
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,410
But I felt like the more it went on, the more confusing it got.

442
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,750
So I don't know.

443
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,950
It got like super convoluted.

444
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,230
And like lots of retcons were happening.

445
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,290
So like I stopped paying attention to it.

446
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,710
No one really pays attention to the lore anyway these days.

447
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,410
Woo!

448
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,350
Alright, so that's the spaceship where she comes from.

449
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,090
Yay!

450
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,630
Oh, it's like a tracer gun!

451
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,830
I just noticed it.

452
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,330
I don't like the font.

453
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,750
I really... I don't know.

454
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,270
It feels like...

455
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,830
Middle School PowerPoint Project.

456
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,410
I don't know.

457
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,430
That's what the font reminds me of.

458
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,970
Like, it looks like fucking PowerPoint.

459
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,810
Middle School PowerPoint.

460
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,170
Like, I was always like, my wife is so cute.

461
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,610
Do you know what she reminds... Oh!

462
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,390
That's what...

463
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,510
She reminds me of the fucking idol girl in Marvel Rivals where she dances to heel.

464
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,370
I'd be like, come on guys!

465
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,270
Dance to heel!

466
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,390
Let's go!

467
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,050
That's what she reminds... Cause it's the gliding!

468
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,170
I wonder if it was inspired by that.

469
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,330
Yeah, Dazzler!

470
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,310
The clap!

471
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,170
That's why I was like, why is she so familiar?

472
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,710
Yeah, the K-pop girl in Marvel Rivals.

473
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,070
Cause like she... The way she moves is just like her.

474
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,030
Cause like they both like glide.

475
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,870
Orbital Ray.

476
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,070
That's actually crazy.

477
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,370
She sends out a fucking ray from the sky.

478
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,170
Then she's like literally Luna Snow.

479
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,110
You're gonna see exactly what I mean.

480
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,190
That's why I scheduled Marvel... Well, to be fair.

481
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,590
That's why I scheduled Overwatch before Marvel Rivals.

482
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,230
So you can see the direct comparison between the two.

483
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,490
Cause that's... She even looks like her!

484
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,210
Like, it's like... Isn't that like...

485
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,130
Okay, to be fair, they both have like short hairstyle.

486
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,290
Like, it's so similar!

487
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,030
It's so similar.

488
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,730
Alright, so that is Juno!

489
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,150
Alright, let's check out... I downloaded somebody's gameplay too.

490
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,810
So we're gonna pretend.

491
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,610
I specifically looked for somebody who has like...

492
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,130
No commentary.

493
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,810
So we can like...

494
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,010
I'll pretend I'm playing.

495
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:09,410
Okay?

496
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,170
Just for you guys.

497
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,650
I'm gonna...

498
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,730
But this is... It's from this guy.

499
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,750
This guy has like... I think this video has like zero views or whatever.

500
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,630
Like, okay, sorry.

501
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,810
This video has two views and it's from me.

502
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,550
Um...

503
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,970
This guy... This is...

504
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,950
Guys, I'm playing Juno on the controller right now.

505
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,770
But... I thought I was... I just wanted to look at... I just wanted to see what the gameplay is like.

506
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,890
So you shoot to heal.

507
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,970
But yeah, huge shout out to that guy.

508
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,810
Literally, there was like three people with no commentary Juno gameplay.

509
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,690
Two of that gameplay was like in...

510
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,690
I think like...

511
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,850
I don't know what language it was in.

512
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,870
It was not English.

513
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,370
Like, I think it was like a European language.

514
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,130
I don't know.

515
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,990
I just... It was...

516
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,910
It was not in English.

517
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,770
So I was like, I'm gonna download an English gameplay.

518
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,110
I think she is projectile.

519
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,250
Oh my gosh, you can tell this is like fucking controller.

520
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,410
Oh,

521
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,450
okay.

522
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,730
So that heals everybody.

523
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,890
Okay, that's nice to know.

524
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,650
Oh, and then she has...

525
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,970
What is that?

526
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,710
What is that shield?

527
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,810
I can't tell what that shield is.

528
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,670
It's like you're shooting...

529
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,030
Okay, yeah, the super soaker.

530
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,410
Yeah, the controller turn.

531
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,250
Oh, the heals are really nice.

532
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,830
It's like super fast.

533
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,710
I don't know what the...

534
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,510
Is it speed ring?

535
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,470
Oh, it's a speed ring.

536
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,670
Okay, so when you're in the ring, you're faster.

537
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,230
That's really nice.

538
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,690
So like...

539
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,230
That's pretty good.

540
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,070
I think I like...

541
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,690
And then she like glides just like Mercy apparently.

542
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,730
Like her gliding.

543
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,430
Yeah, like I like how...

544
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,210
Like how...

545
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,290
Look how fast I...

546
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,570
Okay, look at your Orisa.

547
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,610
Heal your Orisa.

548
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,970
Okay, this healing is insane though.

549
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,070
I think the healing is insane.

550
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,350
The output for how fast it is.

551
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:17,830
I'm just like thinking like how fast would your heals be if you were in the speed ring in general.

552
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,210
If you're all in the speed ring.

553
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,150
And you just like...

554
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,450
If you're...

555
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,210
If you speed ring yourself to heal.

556
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,750
It seems like it could like save...

557
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,510
You can save somebody really fast from that.

558
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,470
No heal only DPS.

559
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,810
Yeah, her missiles.

560
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,750
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

561
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,230
The missile heal is locked in.

562
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,430
Yeah, I noticed that too.

563
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
That's such a fast heal.

564
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,660
Holy shit.

565
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,720
In general.

566
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,220
And I like how it's locked in.

567
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,880
So like you don't have to...

568
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,060
You can like do the locked in missile and then like hide behind the wall right after.

569
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,560
Shoot the monkey!

570
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,880
Oh, okay.

571
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,640
Sorry, I can't.

572
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,340
Console players.

573
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,820
Just I don't know.

574
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,280
Console players has like a different meta.

575
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,840
Because I know a lot of console players play Torbjorn because they have...

576
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,220
They have like the extra turret.

577
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,660
So,

578
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm going to be listening so close by.

579
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,400
DPS.

580
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,120
Only bass.

581
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,240
Have no excuse.

582
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,560
It feels strong.

583
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,900
But I feel like they're going nerf this.

584
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,300
That's not really so I didn't play it during the technical preview was their their have.

585
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,220
They were definitely in it.

586
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,160
This is he'll up to.

587
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,020
No.

588
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,020
Does it fly more?

589
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,760
This is the most round the fucking Juno I've ever seen.

590
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,880
You can tiltedly glide.

591
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,740
Oh!

592
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,640
Okay.

593
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,180
This is the speed, right?

594
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,580
Oh!

595
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,780
Wait, what?

596
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,280
Wait, it hits them too?

597
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,820
Wait, it heals and hits!

598
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,440
Wait, did you guys see that?

599
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,680
It heals, it heals and like hits people.

600
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,360
And DPS.

601
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
Wait, that's so good!

602
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,500
Wait, this fucking character is busted!

603
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,760
Yeah.

604
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:16,940
Yeah!

605
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,180
That's actually insane!

606
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,680
It heals and damages!

607
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,720
Because I saw the missiles hit the enemy team.

608
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,600
It heals and damage boosts.

609
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,180
It's good for... yeah, she seems like a...

610
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,660
That's what I'm saying!

611
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,520
Lucio's gonna be back in jail.

612
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,260
Back into baby jail you go, Lucio!

613
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,640
Nobody wants to... oh my god, that's counseling.

614
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,440
I wouldn't say busted, given the skill requirement.

615
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,980
Yeah, but in my elo, she's gonna be busted.

616
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,700
Like, yeah.

617
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,980
In my elo, she's gonna be so... like all the DPS players are gonna try and play her like how all the DPS players play Zarya.

618
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,580
Like... and Ana.

619
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,180
Yeah, good Juno would be terrible to play against.

620
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,280
Jeez.

621
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,820
Alright, I'm Juno-ing.

622
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,860
I'm Juno-ing right now.

623
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,960
Alright, Orisa, go in.

624
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,360
Go in.

625
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,980
I need you to engage with that Winston.

626
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,340
Sorry, I'm trying to immerse you guys right at the moment.

627
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,060
Lucio provides a steady speed boost.

628
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,320
Lucio has always been like super...

629
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,820
I think Juno might be more... what's the word?

630
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,980
Juno's gonna be more versatile in like what you can do with her.

631
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Cause Lucio is very... what's the word?

632
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,500
Situational?

633
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:04,780
He's very situational cause right now, only people play Lucio for like Rein or Junker Queen.

634
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,540
That's like literally the only times I see Lucio being played.

635
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,520
But I feel like Juno works so much better.

636
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,040
It seems like for different tanks.

637
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,940
Lucio sucks, yeah, he's been in Lucio jail for a long time.

638
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,120
Usually only like Lucio one-tricks play Lucio.

639
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,580
Or you have a Junker Queen.

640
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,280
At least that doesn't go through.

641
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,980
Yeah, fuck this Mercy there.

642
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,960
At least like... uh...

643
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,940
At least like...

644
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,380
No, nevermind.

645
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,460
I was gonna say something good about Lucio, but he hasn't been good in a long time.

646
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:51,800
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Yeah, I feel like... I like how like Bubbles work.

647
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,360
Like you can't heal through the Winston Bubbles.

648
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,880
How would you rework Lucio?

649
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,100
It's really hard to rework something when there's so many characters now.

650
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:12,340
I don't know how... I feel like... I don't know how League does it, but like it's always so hard to balance like characters the more...

651
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:23,720
Cause like, you know, the more supports you have like the more characters you have in certain roles, the harder it is to balance them to work for other... to make the other characters like work.

652
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,840
Because it's like...

653
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,780
Then you're gonna make Lucio too strong that he's gonna be a must pick.

654
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,160
And you don't... you don't want that.

655
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,380
You want to have people be able to counter swap.

656
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,780
Cause that's the whole thing.

657
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
Oh my god!

658
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,540
Okay!

659
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,000
I fucking... Okay!

660
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,960
I hate the new... hahaha I really hate...

661
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,400
Oh, poor guy.

662
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,720
Hahaha!

663
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,540
Hahaha!

664
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,900
Hahaha!

665
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,820
I hate... I really, really hate the tanks in Overwatch 2 now.

666
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,280
The current... I don't know!

667
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:09,680
Like for those who haven't played in a while, this is the current meta when it comes to Overwatch 2 for tank players.

668
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,880
And this is why nobody wants to play tank.

669
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,380
It's all about which tank counterswaps last.

670
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,160
I have had games...

671
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,200
Cause I've been playing this season.

672
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,760
Cause I want to end Top 500 this season.

673
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,460
I've been playing... Okay, so...

674
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,620
I'm playing Overwatch and like, literally, it's all...

675
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,020
Tanks are just counterswapping each other non-stop.

676
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,100
It was...

677
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,580
Hahaha!

678
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,620
Oh, that was the end.

679
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,260
Okay...

680
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,800
Hahaha!

681
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,040
That's literally it.

682
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,760
It's always tank swap until someone goes MAGA.

683
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,480
Hahaha!

684
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:47,100
Like, it's literally counterswaps, counterswaps, counterswaps, counterswaps, counterswaps, MAGA.

685
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,000
Hahaha!

686
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Hahaha!

687
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,630
It's so annoying!

688
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,250
And then they would shit talk each other.

689
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:05,230
Cause whichever tank wins the counterswap battle, the winner of the counterswap battle would be like, fuck you for counterswapping.

690
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,230
And I'm like, you're both counterswapping!

691
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,730
Like, hahaha!

692
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,170
What are you... What are you...

693
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,050
You're both the problem!

694
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,970
Like... Hahaha!

695
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,970
Hahaha!

696
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,730
Like, what do you mean?

697
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,430
Like, ew!

698
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,170
It's...

699
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,690
This always happens!

700
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:34,530
They would yell at each other for counterswapping, and whoever wins shit talks the other tank and be like, shit player, keep counterswapping!

701
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,810
And I'm like, you're both doing it!

702
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,670
Hahaha!

703
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,770
Hahaha!

704
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,990
Me and a genie want to play... No, that's a thing!

705
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,830
That's what tank is now!

706
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,370
I swear, I don't know if we're gonna experience it today, but this is literally what tanks are now.

707
00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:02,070
It's literally non-stop counterswapping until somebody, like, until the last person who counterswaps at the end, which is... and wins.

708
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:10,990
The last counterswapper usually wins cause they don't have enough... cause the other tank does not have enough time to counterswap to win the game.

709
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,730
Like, it's always that!

710
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,750
It's so annoying!

711
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,250
It's... anyway, we're going into rank.

712
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,650
We've seen a lot about Juno then.

713
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,110
Um, it's awful.

714
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,310
It's so awful.

715
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,650
Like, I'm not...

716
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:28,150
as the person that's playing the support that's not on the tank role, it's so awful because...

717
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,250
cause I can't do anything about it.

718
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:30,890
Like...

719
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,530
Hahaha!

720
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,510
It's basically whoever knows how to play... yeah, it's who knows how to play the most tanks and, like, swaps the last.

721
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:41,970
It's so bad.

722
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,610
Hahaha!

723
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,370
Like, it's like nobody plays tank cause it's such a terrible experience.

724
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:56,110
Uh, like, I watched experiencing it and watching it as the support player is a fucking terrible experience.

725
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,270
I... I feel bad for the people playing it.

726
00:34:59,370 --> 00:34:59,890
Hahaha!

727
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,450
For the tank players playing it.

728
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,290
Hahaha!

729
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,270
It's not even...

730
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,730
It doesn't matter they're broken.

731
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,510
Like...

732
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,510
It just, you know...

733
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,770
It's just terrible.

734
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,630
It feels...

735
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,930
terrible cause then, you know, you lose because you don't know enough tanks.

736
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,330
You're not good enough at all the tanks so you lose.

737
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,550
Hahaha!

738
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:28,110
Yeah, he who swaps last usually... I'm not warmed up by the way so I haven't played Overwatch.

739
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,410
I know I said, like, I wanted to, like, practice, um...

740
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,790
I wanted to practice Overwatch.

741
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,850
Uh, cause I wanted to get... Oh my god.

742
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,150
Bro!

743
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,230
One... Let me 1v1!

744
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,110
I have to literally fight Doomfist!

745
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:44,290
Um...

746
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:50,210
I know I was like, I want to end top 500 for Overwatch this season, but I haven't played Overwatch in a bit, like, since a week so...

747
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,450
What the f- Oh my god!

748
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:53,890
Bro!

749
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,950
I'm fucking streaming!

750
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,290
Let me have this!

751
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,110
Oh wait, I forgot to give you guys audio.

752
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,710
It's alright.

753
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,830
It's fucking deathmatch.

754
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,350
Who cares?

755
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:03,690
Uh...

756
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,330
Alright, there we go.

757
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,290
It's literally deathmatch.

758
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,810
Who cares?

759
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,650
Alright, where's my lane?

760
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:09,890
See?

761
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,530
That's fucking right.

762
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,530
Reversal.

763
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,390
Bitch.

764
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,450
Oh!

765
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,030
What the fuck!

766
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,890
That's not right!

767
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,330
Oh my god!

768
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,170
Come on!

769
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,150
Let me have this!

770
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,490
Stupid Reaper.

771
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,630
Okay, I hate that...

772
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,770
I miss when Cassie didn't have, like, fall off.

773
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,790
So it feels good to shoot somebody.

774
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,610
Bro, that's fucked up.

775
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,470
No!

776
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,870
I missed the shot that matters!

777
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,230
Bro, that's fucked up!

778
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,960
Where are they?

779
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,980
They're up in the house.

780
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,180
Oh.

781
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,460
Oh.

782
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,060
Where did they all go?

783
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,240
I don't wanna be...

784
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,000
What?

785
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,200
Oh!

786
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,560
Yeah, thank you.

787
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,620
Thanks.

788
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,060
Hahaha!

789
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,240
Hahaha!

790
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,800
Save!

791
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,800
Yay!

792
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,660
Bro!

793
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,200
No!

794
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,240
Hahaha!

795
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,390
It's okay.

796
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,670
I got...

797
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,930
Yay!

798
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,070
I'm first with my one kill!

799
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,430
Hahaha!

800
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,630
The Plumacy wins again.

801
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,330
That's nice.

802
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,850
No!

803
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,210
He's literally one!

804
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,390
Pick your goddamn head!

805
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:35,970
Pick your head!

806
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,170
That's fucking right!

807
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,290
I thought so.

808
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,210
I fucking thought so.

809
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,690
Bro!

810
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,730
Oh shit!

811
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,150
I'm sorry.

812
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,830
Hahaha!

813
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,290
What the fuck?

814
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,010
What was I on?

815
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,190
What the fuck was I...

816
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,010
I was like gliding a bit.

817
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,530
Ero, thank you for the super chat.

818
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,610
Thank you, thank you.

819
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,070
Overwatch, hi Toki, love you lots.

820
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,790
Overwatch sucks but we still play it.

821
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,530
It's cause like...

822
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,570
There's like literally no game right now.

823
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,690
There's literally like nothing.

824
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,930
It's like either for us fucking like fast movement shooters.

825
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,450
I mean not fast, like moderate speed.

826
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,290
Hahaha!

827
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,010
Cause tactical shooters fast.

828
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,870
Um... There's nothing we can...

829
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,270
There's nothing to play for us.

830
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,590
Is it really Overwatch or Apex?

831
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,050
Cause then like Call of Duty is way too fast.

832
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,190
Like... I guess like...

833
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,630
Time to... Time to explode.

834
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,350
Time to kill.

835
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,270
All we do... Have you heard of Concord?

836
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,530
Yeah, I heard his dog shit.

837
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,630
Hahaha!

838
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,370
Like I don't know what you want me to say.

839
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,190
That's literally what I heard.

840
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,410
That's... Concord.

841
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,750
Same.

842
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,910
And apparently COD sucks now too.

843
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,150
Everything sucks.

844
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,190
We're just miserable.

845
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,890
We're just miserable players now.

846
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,490
Hahaha!

847
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,330
Fuck you.

848
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,490
I just wanna kill this one guy.

849
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,590
What the fuck!

850
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,630
That's fucked up!

851
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,890
That's fucked up!

852
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,570
I saw you guys as friends!

853
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,390
Miserable but addicted.

854
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,810
We're miserable players.

855
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,390
We're just miserable.

856
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,850
There's nothing else to do.

857
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,410
Haha!

858
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,010
Except for Overwatch or Apex.

859
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,750
Cause nothing... We like nothing.

860
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,110
We don't deserve joy.

861
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:34,570
Hahaha!

862
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,610
That's fucking right.

863
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,850
This is fucked up.

864
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,830
This is... What!

865
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,130
Why did you come over here!

866
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,330
Hahaha!

867
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,750
Hahaha!

868
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,850
This is...

869
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,230
FPS is dying.

870
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,190
We have nothing left.

871
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,410
That's why Marvel...

872
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,710
I feel like... I don't know.

873
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,710
TPS as well.

874
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,950
I don't really find too much joy in TPS.

875
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,290
But I like... I enjoy Marvel Rivals.

876
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,470
I think Marvel Rivals just scratches the itch for an Overwatch player.

877
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,230
I think Marvel Rivals just scratches the itch for an Overwatch player.

878
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,370
A lot of like ex-Overwatch players are playing Marvel Rivals right now too.

879
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,190
The fucking goddamn Overwatch League.

880
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,790
The ex-Overwatch League players 6-stack.

881
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,750
Wait is this a 6-stack?

882
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,530
It's a 6-stack right?

883
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,790
For Marvel Rivals?

884
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:18,470
Yeah.

885
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,050
The ex-Overwatch League players 6-stack that was top 10 or top 20.

886
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,250
I swear.

887
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:30,970
If you guys saw Marvel Rivals leaderboards for the close alpha, it was all...

888
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,650
It was all Overwatch players.

889
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,410
Ex-Overwatch players.

890
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,050
Or current Overwatch players.

891
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,190
All of them were like ex-Overwatch pros.

892
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,390
And they just hogged the top 20 because that's all they play.

893
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,390
Instead of Overwatch.

894
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:47,990
Yeah.

895
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,270
It scratches the itch for us.

896
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,540
It's like...

897
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,940
It's like...

898
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,700
Overwatch skills transfers over to...

899
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,560
Overwatch skills transfers over to Marvel Rivals even though it's TPS.

900
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,020
It's literally the same thing.

901
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,540
Except different POV.

902
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,380
Blade, thank you for the super chat.

903
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,760
Thank you.

904
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,540
No, it's just...

905
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm in the deathmatch which is like waiting for your match to start lobby.

906
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,740
So even they were stream sniping, they were just stream sniping my deathmatch lobby.

907
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,360
So they also are suffering because they are queueing for rank.

908
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,880
Because you have to queue for rank to get into those lobbies.

909
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,160
.

910
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,260
.

911
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,400
.

912
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,060
So like, we're all suffering because they are going to play rank too.

913
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:39,840
So...

914
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
It's so real.

915
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,800
It's fine.

916
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,580
Oh my god.

917
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,560
Why do you play Pharah?

918
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,940
Because then I have to go meta and fucking go...

919
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,540
No!

920
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,200
Okay, I'll do one life.

921
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,960
Because I...

922
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,860
This fucker wants to play Pharah.

923
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,740
I wanna play fucking Zen.

924
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,600
It's fun.

925
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,480
Zen is fun.

926
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,460
Zarya, what are you doing?

927
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,820
Zarya!

928
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,720
I think he got knocked off.

929
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,160
Oh.

930
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,200
Alright.

931
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:07,860
Well...

932
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,440
Oh, they're playing Sigma.

933
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,800
I wasn't gonna play fucking Zenyatta anyway.

934
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,480
Dude, this Ekko is farming the shit out of me.

935
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,940
Alright guys, time for some...

936
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,680
Time for some Zzz's.

937
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,560
.

938
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,340
.

939
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,540
Time to play meta.

940
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,720
It's pharmacy time!

941
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,420
Yay!

942
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,500
Woo!

943
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,440
Pharmacy!

944
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,500
.

945
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,080
Zzz!

946
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,640
Yay!

947
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,980
Pharah, get the fuck off!

948
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,280
Pharah!

949
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,260
Oh, I don't think this Pharah knows I'm not there.

950
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:41,900
Goodbye.

951
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,220
Oh wait, I saved his life.

952
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,700
You're welcome.

953
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,300
Please, at least kill the...

954
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,900
Please.

955
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,980
Oh god, thank you.

956
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,740
Yeah, the thing is this Ekko does not have a Mercy Pocket.

957
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,680
So, we win automatically because of it.

958
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,020
Alright.

959
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,840
Goodbye Pharah.

960
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,480
If you die, you die.

961
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,860
If you die, you die.

962
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,820
Pharah, no!

963
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,700
I'm not with you!

964
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,880
You don't have a Pocket!

965
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,600
Come... Okay, there you go.

966
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:10,940
We're fine.

967
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,760
It's alright.

968
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,700
This Pharah plays as if he has a Pocket.

969
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,800
That's when you know.

970
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,580
Pharah... Yeah, Pharah can barely fly.

971
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,140
They changed something about her.

972
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,420
So, like...

973
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,480
Uh...

974
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,920
Oh god.

975
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,820
See, I told... That's fucking fair.

976
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,240
That's Pharah, bro.

977
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,520
Barely one hit.

978
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,700
That's fucking Pharah.

979
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:36,980
No!

980
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,420
No!

981
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,600
Pharah doesn't need... Oh, well somebody better tell this Pharah.

982
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,520
This Pharah is fucking playing as if he needs a Pocket right now.

983
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,120
Like, look at...

984
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,300
He's fucking playing like he needs a Pocket.

985
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,780
Because he's so hyper aggressive.

986
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,400
Like, no Ana is going to be able to heal you like that.

987
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,120
You're playing out of LOS.

988
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,100
Winston, bro.

989
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,820
I don't know why he's playing Zarya too.

990
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,460
This is the whole Overwatch experience.

991
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,380
Pharah, please swap so I can play a better game.

992
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,800
So I can enjoy my game.

993
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,640
I...

994
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,300
Oops.

995
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,580
Time to leave.

996
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:24,980
What?

997
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,780
Okay.

998
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,260
What?

999
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,640
Oh my god!

1000
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,520
What is going on?

1001
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:35,940
Alright.

1002
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,560
Goodbye, Zarya.

1003
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,300
I mean, I could rez.

1004
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,440
And then die for it?

1005
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,120
Question mark?

1006
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,540
No, Ana, I'm sorry.

1007
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,660
You just gotta die.

1008
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,220
Wait, unless...

1009
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,340
Okay, nice.

1010
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,420
Okay, Zarya, I...

1011
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,740
I don't know, Zarya.

1012
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,280
Zarya, why are you there?

1013
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,160
How did you get there?

1014
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,060
Zarya, how the fuck How the fuck...

1015
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,600
Somebody push the car!

1016
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:04,880
Okay.

1017
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,140
How did he get there?

1018
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,920
For the greater good.

1019
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,100
How the fuck did he get there, though?

1020
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,940
Oh no, he went...

1021
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,340
Oh no, he has Sigma.

1022
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,580
I'm gonna not be there.

1023
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,380
Because he still has Sigma.

1024
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,340
Oh.

1025
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,400
Here it is.

1026
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Am I gonna get pulled?

1027
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,220
Oh shit.

1028
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,720
What the fuck!

1029
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,480
Where did he...

1030
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,300
Okay.

1031
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,340
Alright.

1032
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,240
I don't know where he Sigma ulted, by the way.

1033
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,160
I...

1034
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,420
I have no idea where the Sigma ult went.

1035
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,360
I just watched the Sigma fly for 20 years and then Echo appeared?

1036
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:57,840
Echo?

1037
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,180
No.

1038
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,400
Goddammit.

1039
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:00,900
It's fine.

1040
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,260
Got it.

1041
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,280
Let this Zarya.

1042
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,860
There we go.

1043
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,840
Kill the Ilari.

1044
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,320
Kill Ilari.

1045
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,320
He's not healing.

1046
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,400
He's just DPSing.

1047
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,060
Alright.

1048
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,540
There we go.

1049
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,060
I have no idea where the fuck the Echo came from.

1050
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,560
Oh, thank god.

1051
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,040
Are you swapping?

1052
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,020
Please.

1053
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,500
Let me enjoy the game!

1054
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,500
Also, I found Elk.

1055
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,280
I don't know if you guys know this change.

1056
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,700
I did not know this change, because this was not in the old Overwatch rank system.

1057
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,940
But you gotta win 50 games now.

1058
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,560
In the past, you had to play...

1059
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,000
You had to play 50 games.

1060
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,440
Oh my god.

1061
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,760
Oh my god.

1062
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,620
Oh my god.

1063
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,220
I heard it.

1064
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,960
Yeah, you have to win 50 games, which I think is... Oh my god.

1065
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,260
Please.

1066
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,080
Leave me alone.

1067
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,820
I thought that was a bullshit change.

1068
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,960
I wonder like... Jesus, goodbye.

1069
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:02,980
Alright.

1070
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,280
To defeat a Rein, it's time to swap.

1071
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,460
I swear to god.

1072
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,220
Swap.

1073
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,580
Pharah, I'm not gonna pocket you anymore.

1074
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,560
Can we Ilari?

1075
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,920
Okay.

1076
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,100
Alright.

1077
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,840
Alright, let's go.

1078
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,000
I don't know why you wanted Ilari, but...

1079
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,500
Wait, where?

1080
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,440
Jesus Christ.

1081
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,680
Oh my god.

1082
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,160
Okay.

1083
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,140
It doesn't help that like, you know...

1084
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,820
Shit, I forgot.

1085
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,760
That was not the pylon.

1086
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,620
I wanted to use the pylon.

1087
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,400
You can tell I have not played Ilari, because I never needed to.

1088
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,360
I never needed to play Ilari.

1089
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,620
Woo!

1090
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,320
Goodbye.

1091
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,380
Goodbye.

1092
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,240
Hahaha.

1093
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,980
Woo!

1094
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,260
Alright.

1095
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,780
I can't put the pylon.

1096
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,940
No pylon, guys.

1097
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,820
I don't know why you guys want me to play Ilari, but okay.

1098
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,380
I'm trying to help him.

1099
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:30,920
I'm trying to help him.

1100
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,440
Oh my god, he's so low.

1101
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,600
He's actually so low.

1102
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,270
Wait, he's Ilari?

1103
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:42,650
Why?

1104
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,490
I guess for the ult?

1105
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,050
I'll put it on the cart.

1106
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:51,750
There we go.

1107
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:55,650
Please!

1108
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,310
Keep the Cassidy up!

1109
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,130
Oh, what?!

1110
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,050
I'm behind the p-

1111
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,000
That's crazy!

1112
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,400
Okay, I have ult, though.

1113
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,540
Oh!

1114
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,260
Wee!

1115
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,840
Nice.

1116
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:19,840
It's fine.

1117
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,100
We got the Hanzo ult.

1118
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,820
And then I can Ilari ult this.

1119
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,600
I'll put it on here.

1120
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:29,940
Nice.

1121
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:31,860
Cruisy.

1122
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,480
Oh, fuck.

1123
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:33,760
Okay.

1124
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,000
I'll put it here.

1125
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:35,880
Hahaha.

1126
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,700
Wait, what?

1127
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,200
Yay!

1128
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,840
I was gonna say, where the fuck do I use this?

1129
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,440
They all dead.

1130
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,160
They're all dead!

1131
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:51,900
Yay!

1132
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,960
We're doing good!

1133
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,060
That's all that matters.

1134
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,580
Alright, now I wanna play Jinara.

1135
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:00,880
Nice.

1136
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,360
It's okay, I blocked the door.

1137
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,160
I don't think anybody was going there, but I blocked the door, guys.

1138
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,020
Alright.

1139
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:07,880
Guys!

1140
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,360
I don't think anybody was there!

1141
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,140
But like...

1142
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,340
I blocked the possibility!

1143
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,200
That's all that matters!

1144
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,200
I heard they got...

1145
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,800
They got rid of...

1146
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,120
They're getting rid of gold guns.

1147
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,060
I heard.

1148
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:33,400
Anyway, now that I'm not corporate, I can say that people are planning on... It's so fucked up.

1149
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:41,620
It's like the Pink Mercy black market, but people are planning on buying gold guns for like... uh...

1150
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,280
Because like... we get legacy coins.

1151
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,280
Legacy competitive coins.

1152
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,580
And...

1153
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,560
uh... people are planning on like...

1154
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,360
hoarding their legacy competitive coins to buy like...

1155
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,800
new character gold guns.

1156
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,700
So it's gonna be even rarer to find like gold guns for newer characters.

1157
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:06,540
So people are planning on like selling accounts with like Juno gold guns because it's gonna be really rare to get it.

1158
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,800
Because like...

1159
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,600
not a lot of people save their competitive coins.

1160
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,740
Because I'm not a gold gun.

1161
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,400
I save them.

1162
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,400
But like...

1163
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,860
Because I didn't have any character I wanted to... Are you fair again?

1164
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,340
Oh my god.

1165
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,480
I was not paying attention.

1166
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,060
I was not paying attention clearly.

1167
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,650
Oh, they're running Zarya.

1168
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:32,770
I don't like that.

1169
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,260
Okay, I'm gonna put...

1170
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,160
Oh my god.

1171
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,620
Alright, fine.

1172
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:40,580
Cool.

1173
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,220
Okay.

1174
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,420
Where is Zarya?

1175
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,480
I need to fucking swap.

1176
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,040
Nice.

1177
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,510
Oh my god.

1178
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,090
I don't... I hate... I hate babying a DPS.

1179
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,930
If I'm not like duo with them.

1180
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:59,870
Because you don't have communication.

1181
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:09,230
Like if they wanna... It's so hard... It's not hard but it's so annoying to pocket somebody if you don't use comms for the pocket.

1182
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,270
It's just not as fun.

1183
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:11,950
You know?

1184
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,710
He's dead.

1185
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:16,550
Don't worry.

1186
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,070
I got you!

1187
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,150
I got you!

1188
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:23,450
Because it's... Obviously it's easier to pocket when you know...

1189
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,250
When you know when they need it.

1190
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,570
Yeah, you have to predict them.

1191
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:29,590
Jesus, this echo.

1192
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,530
This fucking echo.

1193
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,670
I love to juggle my orbs so much.

1194
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,230
Oh.

1195
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:41,090
They're just poking our Zarya.

1196
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,070
They're not What the fuck is this Sombra?

1197
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,630
I don't like it.

1198
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,730
Oh, she almost has Zarya ult that fast?

1199
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:51,930
Holy shit.

1200
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,070
You have orb!

1201
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:53,770
You have orb!

1202
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,090
I don't know what you want from me!

1203
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,910
I need to pay attention.

1204
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,790
So... Like right now.

1205
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,070
Ooh.

1206
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,870
Get over here.

1207
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,210
There you go.

1208
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:07,690
You're welcome!

1209
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,750
I saved your life!

1210
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,590
Oh shit fam!

1211
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:13,850
I will pop ult!

1212
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,160
Don't worry!

1213
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,620
I got you!

1214
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,420
Get away!

1215
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,760
That's right!

1216
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,880
Get away from my eyes!

1217
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,600
I'll pick your ass!

1218
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,460
Alright.

1219
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,600
It's alright.

1220
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,060
She's alive.

1221
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,080
Supporting carry.

1222
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,000
My Ana is really good.

1223
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,580
I really like my Ana.

1224
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,720
She's like... She's landing her sleeps unlike me.

1225
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:47,820
God.

1226
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,740
This Sombra is looking for her ult.

1227
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,460
I can tell.

1228
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,660
Just scary.

1229
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,200
I can tell that...

1230
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,740
Oh god.

1231
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,940
I can tell that she's looking for a Sombra ult right now.

1232
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:00,960
Which is very scary!

1233
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,260
Because...

1234
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,760
I don't know...

1235
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,180
No way!

1236
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:05,960
No way!

1237
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,880
Oh god.

1238
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,420
I lived.

1239
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,740
But it doesn't matter.

1240
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,680
I lived though.

1241
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:13,840
I lived though.

1242
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,700
He has ult!

1243
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,360
He has ult!

1244
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,060
He has... Zyrean please!

1245
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,920
Zyrean please!

1246
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,320
Please I can't kick that away!

1247
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,140
I can tell!

1248
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,500
I can tell!

1249
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,640
It actually hit me!

1250
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,280
No!

1251
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,660
I failed the Sombra ult too!

1252
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,180
I failed the Sombra ult too!

1253
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,200
I was like...

1254
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,920
This is it.

1255
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,040
Okay I'm going to go Lucio.

1256
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,600
We can still...

1257
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,020
Oh my god.

1258
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:43,260
Sorry.

1259
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,480
My sense for Lucio was so high.

1260
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,440
And I was not used to it.

1261
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,980
It's not used to it.

1262
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:49,900
Oh no.

1263
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,660
Can we touch it?

1264
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,480
Yes!

1265
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:51,780
No!

1266
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,120
We were so close to touching it!

1267
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,000
I forgot I have a super high sense on Lucio.

1268
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,200
Because I haven't played Lucio in a long time.

1269
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:02,960
Like...

1270
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:06,640
I...

1271
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:06,960
I...

1272
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,720
I have not played... like... not... you know...

1273
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,860
I haven't played Lucio in a long time.

1274
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,080
I was like...

1275
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,480
I was like...

1276
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,240
I haven't played Lucio in a long time.

1277
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,160
Because this high sense...

1278
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,200
disoriented me so hard.

1279
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,020
Uh...

1280
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,360
The high sense really disoriented me.

1281
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,160
Oh no.

1282
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,180
No!

1283
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,500
You got me good!

1284
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,140
It's still winnable though.

1285
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,100
We just need to reset.

1286
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,700
We are super staggered.

1287
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,540
I might have to use my res to...

1288
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,200
un-stagger us.

1289
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,140
Alright.

1290
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,680
Time to babysit the Pharah.

1291
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,840
Hello Pharah.

1292
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,420
Your babysitter is here.

1293
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,780
Oh my god.

1294
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,220
Well...

1295
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:52,520
Okay.

1296
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,080
That was like on him.

1297
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,120
Honestly.

1298
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,740
I don't know what that guy expected.

1299
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,800
Like...

1300
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,240
Honestly.

1301
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:03,840
Oh!

1302
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,040
This is where I die I think.

1303
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,080
Here you go Cassidy.

1304
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,480
Like...

1305
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,440
I don't know.

1306
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,600
I don't know.

1307
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,420
I'm trying to figure it out too.

1308
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:17,600
I'm trying to figure it out too.

1309
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,060
Are you serious?

1310
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,100
Oh my god!

1311
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,120
Did I get solo ulti?

1312
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,200
Like what?

1313
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,020
Holy shit!

1314
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,600
I...

1315
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,620
Push over!

1316
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,800
What the fuck?

1317
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,980
I actually got this guy!

1318
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,440
I was promised Juno's not even available!

1319
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,660
Okay I'm gonna fucking have to swap off.

1320
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,160
And then I guess they really want me to play Lari.

1321
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,260
And then I guess they really want me to play Lari.

1322
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,660
Bro you were on Pharah!

1323
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,880
What the fuck do you mean?

1324
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,240
I was literally...

1325
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:58,460
Okay.

1326
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,420
This is as defensive as I can get.

1327
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,780
You literally went fucking...

1328
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,060
W key so hard!

1329
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,780
It's not our fault you W...

1330
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,740
Oh god Zarya please.

1331
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,540
I just wanna use this so we can...

1332
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,540
Resituate.

1333
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,680
We're gonna use this to fucking resituate so I can swap off.

1334
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,020
We're gonna use this to fucking resituate so I can swap off.

1335
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,660
Please.

1336
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,820
Kill one person so it matters.

1337
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,280
Oh okay.

1338
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,820
I mean he wasted his ult.

1339
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,880
So like that's good.

1340
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,780
Okay this... Watch this Cassidy die in front of me.

1341
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,260
Guys I don't know guys.

1342
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,280
This is...

1343
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,360
Not the best idea right now.

1344
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,040
Alright.

1345
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:54,570
Okay.

1346
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,430
Using that Lucio to go straight in!

1347
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,500
Alright!

1348
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,840
This is where I die!

1349
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,880
I touched it!

1350
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,400
Your turn!

1351
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,080
It's just...

1352
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,220
Why do we still have a Zarya?

1353
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,100
Why?

1354
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,480
This is what I mean!

1355
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,900
It's just counter tank!

1356
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,320
They went monkey!

1357
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,320
It's free D.Va hours!

1358
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,880
It's literally free D.Va!

1359
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,480
Bro!

1360
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,160
It's literally free D.Va pick!

1361
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,680
It's literally the freest D.Va pick you can get!

1362
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,460
Okay you just gotta... guys.

1363
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:41,980
Alright.

1364
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,880
You're a great Zarya player but you don't counterswap.

1365
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,720
I can't.

1366
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,000
I need a counterswap tank.

1367
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,160
I need a tank that knows how to counterswap.

1368
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,400
That's really it.

1369
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,300
She's good but like...

1370
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,280
Not against Winston!

1371
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:12,750
Winston!

1372
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,330
Jesus you're fu- I don't care.

1373
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:18,490
You die you still touch.

1374
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,510
Please stop!

1375
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,570
And you just didn't want to touch!

1376
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,290
Oh my god!

1377
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,030
He's a good Zarya player!

1378
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:45,850
But like... if we had a Winston during the last defense it would've been easier.

1379
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:52,230
We literally needed uh... we literally needed D.Va for that last part.

1380
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:55,710
Oh my god why?

1381
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,610
Okay I would've played...

1382
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,530
Jesus Christ.

1383
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,570
Juggling of orbs is so f***ing difficult sometimes.

1384
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:05,450
Okay.

1385
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,110
Well he's Rein so that's easier.

1386
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,390
I know a lot of people were playing Ilari though now.

1387
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:15,110
Okay.

1388
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,390
Is our Ana okay?

1389
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,590
Okay as long as our Ana is okay.

1390
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:20,330
Nice!

1391
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,310
I'm juggling orbs right now!

1392
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,550
Play f***ing juggler!

1393
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:31,330
Alright.

1394
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,890
What the f*** is going on?

1395
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:37,930
I'm amazed you got 13 devs?

1396
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:38,730
Oh my god.

1397
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:45,430
To be fair both DPS has 13 devs so it's like...

1398
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,370
I don't want to...

1399
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,170
I think our Faerie might die unless we...

1400
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,190
Nice okay.

1401
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,670
We did it.

1402
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:58,630
But they literally have one fight so like I'm trying to make sure that...

1403
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,710
Yep okay nevermind.

1404
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:00,810
Okay.

1405
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,750
They might push with that now.

1406
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,170
Alright.

1407
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,590
Trying to...

1408
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,610
Juggling the orb!

1409
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,030
Juggling the orb right now!

1410
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,050
Juggling the orb right now!

1411
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:21,470
Oh god.

1412
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,170
I can't f***ing get...

1413
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,370
Damage in.

1414
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,730
Because of that stupid Rein shield.

1415
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,000
Alright.

1416
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:33,940
Backing up!

1417
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,180
Oh.

1418
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:39,540
What?

1419
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:41,840
Nice!

1420
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,380
That's good for us!

1421
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:45,960
Alright.

1422
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,500
Nice.

1423
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,980
I can trans this.

1424
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,280
Didn't need it.

1425
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,600
Alright.

1426
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,240
There we go.

1427
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,180
Stay alive!

1428
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,720
STAY ALIVE!

1429
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,700
STAY ALIVE ANA!

1430
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,880
Okay we're fine.

1431
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:02,940
That's fine.

1432
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,080
There's somebody to my left.

1433
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,920
They have shatter though.

1434
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,100
Like 100%.

1435
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,700
And...

1436
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:15,840
Oh!

1437
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,220
Good luck.

1438
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,640
They have shatter so like...

1439
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,640
A little scared about it.

1440
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,180
Oh nice.

1441
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,720
Oh but...

1442
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,520
Thanks.

1443
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,260
Okay.

1444
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,120
Please stay alive.

1445
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,660
No I can't die with the life!

1446
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,640
Wait is it Ana?

1447
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,880
No it's Mei and Ana.

1448
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,140
Okay.

1449
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,080
Oh god.

1450
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,780
Oh god sorry.

1451
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,220
Please.

1452
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,060
Please Mei.

1453
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:44,720
Mei please.

1454
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,740
Please our pharaoh is coming at me!

1455
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:55,250
Oh no I'm getting fucking shot at by...

1456
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,390
I'm getting shot at by Lari!

1457
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,110
What do you mean?

1458
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,830
You don't seep!

1459
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:10,330
I give you one free take!

1460
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,210
I give you one free take!

1461
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:11,470
I give you one free take!

1462
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:14,350
Oh my god.

1463
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,650
Jesus Christ!

1464
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,390
What the fuck is going on?

1465
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:19,210
Here we go.

1466
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:20,030
I...

1467
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,490
Really these two...

1468
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:32,590
What the fuck is going on?

1469
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,930
Oh my god.

1470
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,910
Die on cart.

1471
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,370
Oh my god.

1472
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,750
Who made pro IGL?

1473
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:45,610
Jesus!

1474
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,630
This is dysfunctional.

1475
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:53,650
Bro this is my first game!

1476
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:56,070
What the fuck is going on?

1477
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,310
Oh my god.

1478
01:03:59,650 --> 01:03:59,710
Oh my god.

1479
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,850
I know it was a good idea.

1480
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:01,990
If they have...

1481
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,370
I feel like Zen would be a better pick just for the...

1482
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,330
Just for the orbs.

1483
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,290
But like...

1484
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,390
More healing goes in.

1485
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,470
This Ana is really good.

1486
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,350
I like this Ana though.

1487
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,850
This Ana has had really good...

1488
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,870
Really good decision making.

1489
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:20,990
Quiet now.

1490
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,470
Oh shit!

1491
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:27,990
Holy fuck!

1492
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,270
Oh that sniper is nice.

1493
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,220
We're fine.

1494
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:37,720
We're fine.

1495
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,840
We're fine.

1496
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,140
Jesus Christ.

1497
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,320
There you go.

1498
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,560
I'm just going for the kill.

1499
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,160
I'm just going for the extra heals at this point.

1500
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,270
Oh my god.

1501
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,670
People are so mad!

1502
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:58,810
Oh my god.

1503
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:58,850
People are so mad!

1504
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:03,590
Oh my god.

1505
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,990
I think the extra heals was a good decision.

1506
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:06,990
Nice.

1507
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,530
Our Ashe is good too.

1508
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,070
Oh shit!

1509
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,070
Yeah we have a good Ashe.

1510
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,690
I hope you have Ice Block!

1511
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,610
Okay you do.

1512
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,090
Okay nice.

1513
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,030
Don't worry Ana I got you.

1514
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:22,710
I got you Ana.

1515
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:23,950
And I got you too.

1516
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,130
Okay this Ashe is actually carrying us.

1517
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:29,990
There you go.

1518
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:30,830
I don't want you to die.

1519
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,430
You're not gonna die on me Ashe!

1520
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:33,830
You're literally the carry!

1521
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,290
Alright.

1522
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:39,470
Don't worry I got you.

1523
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,550
I have ult too.

1524
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,730
I might not be DPSing.

1525
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:44,570
But you're all alive.

1526
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:48,490
And that's all that matters right now in this game.

1527
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:52,670
And that's all that matters right now in this game.

1528
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:53,950
What?!

1529
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:54,050
What?!

1530
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,410
He died so fast.

1531
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,990
Okay we just...

1532
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,950
Oh we did not...

1533
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:00,810
Alright Ana we leave.

1534
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,290
Ana we leave.

1535
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:04,090
Ana Ana Ana.

1536
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:08,210
We can recontest this together.

1537
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:10,990
We have ults to recontest this.

1538
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:15,670
Oh my god shut the fuck up!

1539
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:16,550
Our Ashe was carrying!

1540
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,470
Shut the fuck up!

1541
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:20,630
We have a good Ashe!

1542
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:25,750
Alright.

1543
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,030
Oh okay.

1544
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:45,030
Oh that was...

1545
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,910
That was a bad move but okay.

1546
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,490
Alright sorry it's you and me.

1547
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,920
Sorry I wish you did not take that though.

1548
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:58,960
Sorry.

1549
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,720
Why did you take that?

1550
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,220
Sorry!

1551
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,220
Why did you take the heal?

1552
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,760
Oh my god.

1553
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,180
Oh my god.

1554
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,740
Sorry I should not have taken the heals.

1555
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,920
But that's okay.

1556
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,280
That's okay.

1557
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,340
Oh my god.

1558
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:24,230
I don't know why I got an ult.

1559
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,890
But okay.

1560
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:25,970
Oh.

1561
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,090
I need to make sure our fucking Ashe lives though.

1562
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:31,790
At this rate.

1563
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:32,530
We got pick?

1564
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:33,570
I think?

1565
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:34,810
Why?

1566
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:38,010
I might be dead.

1567
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:39,510
Ana heal me here?

1568
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:43,010
I'm here.

1569
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,130
Zarya please.

1570
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,030
Oh they have Zarya.

1571
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,390
Grab two.

1572
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,030
Do we have ult?

1573
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:52,690
We do.

1574
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:54,210
We have ult for the last time.

1575
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,530
Last fight.

1576
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,070
I'm trying.

1577
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:00,490
I'm literally sacrificing.

1578
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,010
I sacrificed my life for this.

1579
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,930
So I hope they do something with it.

1580
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,370
Oh my god.

1581
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:08,490
Please.

1582
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:10,390
Literally Ilaria is one.

1583
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:11,410
Ilaria is one.

1584
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,570
Oh god please.

1585
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,310
Oh no.

1586
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:18,830
Just freeze in there.

1587
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,240
Oh god.

1588
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,440
Oh god please.

1589
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:34,780
Please.

1590
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,180
I'm trying to kick you up.

1591
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,560
As long as I can.

1592
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:39,740
Please.

1593
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:43,880
Please.

1594
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,700
I'm literally trying so hard.

1595
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,840
Oh god.

1596
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:55,510
Please.

1597
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,070
I kept you guys up for so long.

1598
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,180
Guys I think my team.

1599
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,400
Fell apart.

1600
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,180
I think my team fell apart.

1601
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,620
Oh my god.

1602
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,580
My team was a mess.

1603
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:20,840
My team was a mess.

1604
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,640
I'm gonna avoid both the DPS.

1605
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,520
I'm gonna avoid these two.

1606
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,360
These two should not be together.

1607
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,060
These two should not be together.

1608
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,860
Oh my god.

1609
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,440
These two.

1610
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,880
This guy and this guy.

1611
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,520
They cannot be together.

1612
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,300
Our fucking.

1613
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,840
Ashe was so fucking good too.

1614
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,280
Oh my god.

1615
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,900
These two.

1616
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:55,440
Our Zarya needed a fucking swap.

1617
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:59,040
He still played Zarya until the very end.

1618
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,720
He was a great Zarya.

1619
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,520
But like holy.

1620
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,260
He should have swapped out.

1621
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,320
Our Ana was insane.

1622
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,840
Our Ana was really good.

1623
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,620
Our Ana was really good.

1624
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,660
Our Ashe was really good too.

1625
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,700
But these two.

1626
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,340
These two were just.

1627
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,620
They were not meant to be together.

1628
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,760
They were oil and water.

1629
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,300
They did not.

1630
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,360
Deserve to play together.

1631
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,440
Holy fuck.

1632
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,340
I don't know what else.

1633
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,400
Our Ana, Ashe and I could do.

1634
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,180
We were literally trying so hard.

1635
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:35,880
They were so.

1636
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,760
They were so committed.

1637
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:38,420
They were.

1638
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,660
They were so fucking.

1639
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,400
I just wish he wasn't on fucking Zarya the entire time.

1640
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:44,920
Literally.

1641
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,560
Literally did not need to play Zarya.

1642
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,320
Oh okay.

1643
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,480
If he swapped out Zarya.

1644
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:53,560
We could have won.

1645
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,620
If he was D.Va.

1646
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,300
We could have won.

1647
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,300
That was such a D.Va victory.

1648
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,760
I think we had D.Va.

1649
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,160
There for the last fight.

1650
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,820
The last fight before.

1651
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,880
During the stall.

1652
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,240
We could have won that.

1653
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,840
Oh no it's deathmatch guys.

1654
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,520
So like game practice.

1655
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,440
Because I need it.

1656
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:18,980
Oh my god.

1657
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,180
That was intense though.

1658
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,300
You might have stunned me but it doesn't matter.

1659
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,400
I better aim.

1660
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,320
Yeah.

1661
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,980
Because that counter is Winston.

1662
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,900
That would have been a good D.Va pick.

1663
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,180
Oh.

1664
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,360
Okay.

1665
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:40,760
Oh.

1666
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,880
I keep forgetting that stuns.

1667
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,660
That doesn't do anything.

1668
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,000
I missed the stun.

1669
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,360
You can still shoot when you are Cassidy.

1670
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:48,840
Uh.

1671
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:49,640
Thrown.

1672
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,520
Oh.

1673
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,760
No.

1674
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,800
My two kills.

1675
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,640
My fucking two kill lead.

1676
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:57,840
Oh.

1677
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,780
There is something to my side.

1678
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,260
Unless it's just the...

1679
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:03,820
Oh.

1680
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:05,800
Fucking nerd.

1681
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,400
Play more Tekken get the chance?

1682
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,580
If it was another tournament.

1683
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,080
Yeah.

1684
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,860
I don't think I can play Tekken as like a regular thing.

1685
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,620
I don't think I can be like an FGC streamer in general.

1686
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,390
Oh hey there is that guy again.

1687
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:29,100
Well at least we know he will play Zarya.

1688
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:31,950
At least we know.

1689
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,500
Let's see.

1690
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,360
What is our other guy gonna play?

1691
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:45,760
Oh attack.

1692
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,400
Oh.

1693
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,820
Okay I can play.

1694
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,240
Darkblade thank you for the super chat.

1695
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:51,560
Thank you.

1696
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,620
Since you are talking about TPS what about Splatoon?

1697
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:54,880
Splatoon is dead in the west.

1698
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:59,120
The only games you are gonna get in Splatoon are people in Japan.

1699
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,760
You know he is a good Zarya.

1700
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,920
He just didn't swap.

1701
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,380
Like he is not a bad player.

1702
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,080
And also he was like.

1703
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,060
He and the TPS player were just shit talking each other.

1704
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:19,050
Despite how much I love Splatoon.

1705
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,450
It's a dead game in the west.

1706
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,630
Nobody in the west really plays it.

1707
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,310
And even then.

1708
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,150
It's like the pro players in Splatoon.

1709
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:31,170
Are like.

1710
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:31,970
They don't.

1711
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,730
They don't like even make enough money to survive.

1712
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:41,390
They don't like even make enough money to survive.

1713
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:44,490
Alright.

1714
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:45,530
Yep there he is.

1715
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,150
There is the Zarya.

1716
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:49,530
There he is.

1717
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,430
Oh Echo I hope you peek me.

1718
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,960
I hope you peek me Echo.

1719
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:01,680
Nice.

1720
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,640
Oh I just realized.

1721
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,760
We have a Rein.

1722
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,740
We have a fucking Rein.

1723
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,420
I just realized that.

1724
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,020
Alright.

1725
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,580
That is unlucky for us.

1726
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:19,880
Because usually.

1727
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,840
I mean the enemy team last game had a Rein swap.

1728
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:24,500
But like.

1729
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,480
Usually.

1730
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,400
Yeah.

1731
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,640
I'm not feeling confident with the Rein.

1732
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,640
No I might be dead.

1733
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,520
Please don't let this guy kill me.

1734
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,660
Please don't let this guy kill me.

1735
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,220
Please don't try.

1736
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:46,550
Jesus.

1737
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,710
He is going to have grav soon.

1738
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:49,590
All he is doing is farming grav.

1739
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:55,210
Where is he?

1740
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:56,330
I'm gonna.

1741
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:00,840
Please.

1742
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,400
Do something.

1743
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,880
With that Echo.

1744
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,080
Did he do something with that?

1745
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,680
That one.

1746
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,400
Alright.

1747
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,400
That is at least one bubble gone.

1748
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:15,760
Alright.

1749
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,580
He has grav 100%.

1750
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,740
I can tell.

1751
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,900
I'm so bad at sleeps now.

1752
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:27,180
No.

1753
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:33,590
Alright.

1754
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:36,950
Oh my god.

1755
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:37,870
Thanks so much.

1756
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,690
When I'm playing Ana.

1757
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:38,990
I forgot.

1758
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,410
Why are you still on Rein?

1759
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:45,930
Please.

1760
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,120
I wish you were not still on Rein.

1761
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,260
I wish.

1762
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,000
Please.

1763
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:02,160
Please.

1764
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,340
Pick me.

1765
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:03,680
Please.

1766
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,440
Don't pick the bomb.

1767
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:06,960
Pick me.

1768
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,040
Why are you still Rein?

1769
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,630
He is dead.

1770
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,410
I don't know why he went that way.

1771
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:27,870
Okay.

1772
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,230
That's good.

1773
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:29,530
Zarya.

1774
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,990
Come on.

1775
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,270
Where is Zarya?

1776
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:34,990
Oh god.

1777
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:35,270
No.

1778
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:36,930
Well.

1779
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:39,670
I'm not gonna use my ult there.

1780
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:40,870
Alright.

1781
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:41,930
They still holding grav.

1782
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:43,890
Alright.

1783
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:46,090
Oh.

1784
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:46,790
Thank god.

1785
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,030
Thank god.

1786
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:49,330
Thank god.

1787
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,130
Alright.

1788
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:54,510
We are gonna die to grav.

1789
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:55,070
Guys.

1790
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,090
You wanna watch us die to grav?

1791
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,090
Watch this.

1792
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,250
That's huge.

1793
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,070
Yeah.

1794
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:02,870
That actually is huge.

1795
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,390
I... I... I...

1796
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:05,770
You pick me.

1797
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:09,270
That's actually huge for us.

1798
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:12,890
I need you guys to not be so far away from me.

1799
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:15,510
I need to be away from the Zarya too.

1800
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:19,510
Oh.

1801
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:20,090
Thank god.

1802
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:23,030
Thank god the Zarya was super...

1803
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:26,090
I was not looking when I fucking threw that.

1804
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:28,130
Alright.

1805
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:28,810
Time to B.

1806
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:29,430
Cry bitch.

1807
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:31,890
Please don't die.

1808
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,970
I'm cart bitch.

1809
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:34,190
Oh.

1810
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,590
Whoa.

1811
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:35,330
Okay.

1812
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:35,750
Oh.

1813
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:36,370
Okay.

1814
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:40,830
Alright.

1815
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:43,050
Please don't die.

1816
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:43,590
Zarya.

1817
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:47,650
Oh.

1818
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,130
Miss.

1819
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,450
Fuck.

1820
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,570
I thought he was gonna go back.

1821
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:55,370
I didn't think he would keep going forward.

1822
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:56,990
After all of that.

1823
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,330
I don't know.

1824
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:59,630
It felt like logical.

1825
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,230
That he would go back.

1826
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:01,410
Oh.

1827
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:01,890
Backwards?

1828
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:05,090
I don't.

1829
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,430
Doesn't that feel logical?

1830
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:12,830
Alright.

1831
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:15,670
Try to do some.

1832
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,870
You know.

1833
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:17,890
I thought they would be closer.

1834
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:18,630
Too.

1835
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,110
This is not logical.

1836
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:22,910
It's okay.

1837
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:25,130
They wasted an ult.

1838
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:26,850
Alright.

1839
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:27,330
I'll die.

1840
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:32,470
I thought they'd be pushing out!

1841
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:38,190
I predict... that was a bad prediction from me.

1842
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:40,470
Because they did not do what I thought.

1843
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:45,390
I had a bad prediction.

1844
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:50,130
Because I legitimately thought he was gonna, you know... move up.

1845
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:54,490
I thought he was gonna move back after getting hit.

1846
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:56,890
And I thought the enemy team was gonna push us.

1847
01:18:57,110 --> 01:19:00,190
Also, they're still holding Grav for last fight.

1848
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:01,970
So, I don't know.

1849
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,030
I should've went Kiriko.

1850
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:07,430
I'm gonna see if I can swap to Kiriko in time.

1851
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:10,710
Oh no, Pharah.

1852
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,430
No, Pharah.

1853
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:11,790
No.

1854
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:16,330
They're still...

1855
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:21,410
Oh, what?

1856
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:26,370
Alright, goodbye.

1857
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,430
It's fine, we got the cart!

1858
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:29,730
Okay.

1859
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,890
I'm gonna go Kiriko for the fucking Zarya Grav.

1860
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,610
He still has ult?

1861
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:36,930
Like...

1862
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,210
How does he still have ult?

1863
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:45,550
I've been having bad predictions, though.

1864
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,190
I don't know.

1865
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:48,950
They're not doing the things I think they're doing.

1866
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:55,870
Because you would assume, since we're so close to the point that they would push up...

1867
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:56,870
Because they're five.

1868
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,050
But they didn't do it.

1869
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,070
So, like, I don't know.

1870
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,690
Like, I'm so confused.

1871
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:02,570
I...

1872
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:03,890
I'm just...

1873
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,030
I'm just...

1874
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:08,410
I'm trying to use logic.

1875
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:09,890
But there's no logic.

1876
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:13,750
There's no logic!

1877
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:14,990
Are they gonna ult yet?

1878
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:18,770
Ult here!

1879
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:19,610
Come on, Zarya!

1880
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:21,310
This is so smart to do!

1881
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:23,330
Ult here?

1882
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:26,970
What are you...

1883
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,130
What are you gonna ult?

1884
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:29,910
I don't understand!

1885
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:30,070
I don't understand!

1886
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:32,590
Good luck.

1887
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:35,110
Good luck.

1888
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:36,290
Wait!

1889
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,290
Still no ult?

1890
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,050
Oh, god.

1891
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,730
Still no ult, by the way!

1892
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:45,050
Huge pick.

1893
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,710
I don't know.

1894
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:48,170
I don't know.

1895
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:51,570
There you go.

1896
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:52,010
I cleansed it.

1897
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:53,210
Oh, my god!

1898
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:53,670
There it is!

1899
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,310
It got no button!

1900
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,260
What?

1901
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,040
Okay.

1902
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:01,740
I'm gonna...

1903
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,700
It got nobody, but there it is!

1904
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:04,020
So!

1905
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,040
There it is!

1906
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,080
There it is!

1907
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,680
Holy shit!

1908
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,540
There it is!

1909
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,900
Go, girl!

1910
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:16,880
Give us nothing!

1911
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,140
Oh, my god!

1912
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,800
This is a D1, the Master's Five game!

1913
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,720
You could have done it, like, 20 times, Zarya!

1914
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,080
How many years ago?

1915
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,260
I don't understand.

1916
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,740
Now we know why they...

1917
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:42,980
They had like 20 alts last game.

1918
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,820
And like... I don't understand.

1919
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,040
I don't understand anymore.

1920
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,780
With a huge grab into nothing!

1921
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,900
I feel like if they're gonna run Ana again, I'm gonna go Kiriko.

1922
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,980
This is like the only reason to go Kiriko.

1923
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,200
Also like, I feel like...

1924
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,720
I don't know.

1925
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,860
I feel like these guys are way too aggressive.

1926
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,440
Just too busy typing team chat?

1927
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,960
Bro, okay, avoiding that guy was a good decision.

1928
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,260
It was a good idea.

1929
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,280
Instead of avoiding the Zarya.

1930
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,440
Yeah, I know.

1931
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh my god.

1932
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,400
That was so embarrassing.

1933
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,980
That was so embarrassing for that Zarya.

1934
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:33,640
Literally...

1935
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,500
Literally held that all for...

1936
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,560
Fucking...

1937
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,360
700 fights.

1938
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,400
My predictions didn't work because they had no logic in the way they play.

1939
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,840
Oh my god.

1940
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,800
I mean, you could tell he was a one trick Zarya.

1941
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,040
Like...

1942
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,460
It was not rocket science.

1943
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,900
Because he's...

1944
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,000
Oh.

1945
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,320
I'm scared, but...

1946
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,200
Don't worry.

1947
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,280
I'm here.

1948
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:04,640
Don't worry.

1949
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,480
Don't worry.

1950
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,340
Don't worry.

1951
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,340
Okay, maybe worry a little bit?

1952
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:12,700
Maybe worry...

1953
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,060
I need to keep the Rematra alive though.

1954
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:22,100
Yeah, I can't focus on our Ilari because our Rematra...

1955
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,940
Our tank is much more important.

1956
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:47,600
I'm so sorry, Lari.

1957
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:48,980
I shot that guy once.

1958
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,260
And I think that caused it.

1959
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,220
That one shot.

1960
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,280
That one shot that got you low.

1961
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:01,520
Sorry.

1962
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,060
Sorry, buddy.

1963
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,180
You know, fuck it.

1964
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:07,820
I mean, I have ult right now.

1965
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:09,320
Okay.

1966
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,000
Alright.

1967
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:14,120
Oh!

1968
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,200
Yeah, you did!

1969
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,460
This is where we leave our team.

1970
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,140
Goodbye, mate.

1971
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:22,620
Goodbye.

1972
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,360
Goodbye.

1973
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,500
With loose tank, we leave.

1974
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,960
That's how we do things.

1975
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,040
Please, keep arguing with your team!

1976
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,100
The Genji has ult, though.

1977
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,040
100%.

1978
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,180
I hope he targets me and I have fucking, like, uh...

1979
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:42,240
What's it called?

1980
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,380
I have TP.

1981
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,040
So, and then the team is not with me.

1982
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,960
That's like the most optimal plan to get rid of.

1983
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,980
He should be close to...

1984
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,560
He should be close to another Grav.

1985
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:55,740
Come on!

1986
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,240
Give us something, Zarya!

1987
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,020
Come on, Zarya!

1988
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,680
Kill him!

1989
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,100
Woah!

1990
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,060
Kill the Zarya!

1991
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,260
How is he still alive?!

1992
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:13,830
How the fuck...

1993
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:16,670
Okay, he has no energy, but he definitely has Grav.

1994
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:20,590
Alright.

1995
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:22,150
He definitely still has Grav.

1996
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,290
But we do have a Matra ult, so he could, like, absorb.

1997
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:26,550
I need to make sure I'm not near.

1998
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:28,050
They have Grav Blade!

1999
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,250
I think they're gonna use that as a combo.

2000
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:30,570
Most likely.

2001
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:33,330
I'm not wasting a sleep.

2002
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:34,170
I'll be fine.

2003
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,250
Oh, god.

2004
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:37,210
They're pushing up.

2005
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:38,390
They have Nano Blade!

2006
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,070
They have Nano Blade!

2007
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:42,610
There it is!

2008
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:45,230
Goodbye.

2009
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:46,790
Oh.

2010
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:50,770
Goodbye.

2011
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:51,250
Goodbye.

2012
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:54,010
There you go.

2013
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:55,510
This is how you do it!

2014
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:57,030
Oh, I don't have cleanse, though.

2015
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:57,970
I don't have cleanse.

2016
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,310
I don't have cleanse, Alari.

2017
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:00,770
I don't have cleanse.

2018
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,570
This is how we do it!

2019
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:05,750
And that's how you play support when they have Nano Blade!

2020
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:09,710
That's the strat!

2021
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,600
That's the Nano Blade strat.

2022
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:17,580
Huge.

2023
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,400
Alright, I have... I'm gonna stay here, just in case.

2024
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,780
Damn, what a fucking play.

2025
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,540
That's what I mean!

2026
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:35,600
When you're Kiriko and they have Nano Blade, you get away from your team, hope the Genji fucking tries to Blade you, TP to the other side, climb a wall, and then TP back.

2027
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,560
Yeah, he's... 1-1-1-1-1.

2028
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:39,940
Nice.

2029
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,160
That's fucking right.

2030
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,360
Get over here, Lucio!

2031
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,160
So just bait him.

2032
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:48,420
Yeah.

2033
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:48,720
Nice job.

2034
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:52,020
Also, if you have, like, Suzu... you have to have your Suzu.

2035
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:53,640
I hate Smurfskr.

2036
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,260
Who the fuck is Smurfing?

2037
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,540
Darn Smurfs.

2038
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,280
You sure it's Smurfs?

2039
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,900
I have a fucking, like... what is it?

2040
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,620
Gold account.

2041
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,100
Bro, this guy is on fucking... Mei.

2042
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,060
His name is Smurf, yeah.

2043
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:15,820
Alright, nice.

2044
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,680
That's how you do it.

2045
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,280
Thank God.

2046
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,180
Yay!

2047
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,280
Almost Master IV.

2048
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,180
I think it's Support.

2049
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,540
Leaderboard... okay.

2050
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,960
Um... it is currently...

2051
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,320
Uh...

2052
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,240
What is it currently for Support?

2053
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,480
It is... Masters II!

2054
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:37,580
I mean, that's doable.

2055
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,540
I still need to win 50 games.

2056
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,000
I do not have 50 wins yet.

2057
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:42,880
Yay!

2058
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,960
I don't really need a reason to have another account.

2059
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,400
Honestly.

2060
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,020
Uh...

2061
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,060
I can just grind on this account.

2062
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,740
That's the thing.

2063
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,920
You have to... uh...

2064
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,200
I just avoid... I mostly avoid tank players now.

2065
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,880
It's like, when you have a bad tank, like, it changes everything.

2066
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,160
Like, you just lose.

2067
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:08,840
Like...

2068
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,540
And like, they could be like the best tank in the world!

2069
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,880
But if they only play one character!

2070
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,620
They are fucking dog shit.

2071
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,960
If they literally have...

2072
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,240
If they can only play one tank, they're dog shit.

2073
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:29,260
It doesn't matter if they're like the best tank at that tank in the world.

2074
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,560
If it's just one tank, then there's no point.

2075
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,460
Because... oh no, not Skirmish.

2076
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,280
Please, not Skirmish.

2077
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,380
I don't want to be in Skirmish.

2078
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,780
Skirmish people just say hello to each other.

2079
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:41,300
Hello!

2080
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,640
Um... oh.

2081
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,860
The moment I said that...

2082
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,020
I'm so sorry.

2083
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:48,600
I'm so sorry.

2084
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:48,820
Hello.

2085
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,080
I'm a Hammond one trick, you're part of the problem.

2086
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,360
Incredible timing.

2087
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:01,900
Alright.

2088
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,760
Who the fuck is playing Rein?

2089
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,180
In my deathmatch.

2090
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,400
Oh my god, this is worse!

2091
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,920
The Doom was the worst pick.

2092
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,360
Are you trying to hammer me?

2093
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,260
That's fucking right.

2094
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,140
That's fucking...

2095
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:21,890
That's what you get.

2096
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,350
Oh shit!

2097
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:28,210
This is my hero.

2098
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:29,770
No, no no no no.

2099
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:30,430
No!

2100
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:31,430
No!

2101
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,010
Oh my god...

2102
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:39,650
You guys still died to him.

2103
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,290
That's fucked up.

2104
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:43,650
Please.

2105
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,590
Please, don't come after me.

2106
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:47,810
Please, if I don't shoot you.

2107
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,390
If I don't shoot you, you won't shoot me.

2108
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:51,410
I just.

2109
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,090
I don't.

2110
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,070
I do not want to deal...

2111
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:55,190
NOOOOOO!

2112
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:55,710
Please!

2113
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:02,010
I don't really understand the emotions.

2114
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:04,670
Alright.

2115
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:05,470
Oh god.

2116
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,450
Okay, one of the tanks is still there.

2117
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:13,130
I swear to god, I will bully the shit out of this Rein player if he fucks with me again.

2118
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:15,270
Oh my god!

2119
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:17,690
Is he protecting the Cassidy?!

2120
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,030
What?!

2121
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,510
Okay!

2122
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:20,450
Fuck this!

2123
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,850
That is so fucked up!

2124
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:24,470
Fuck this!

2125
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:26,790
That is so... wait!

2126
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,730
He act... oh my god!

2127
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:31,130
I'm gonna...

2128
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,730
Did you fuck this Rein?

2129
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:34,910
He actually fucking...

2130
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:37,170
blocked for the...

2131
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,490
blocked for the Cassidy!

2132
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,850
This fucker.

2133
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:43,810
This actual fucker.

2134
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:56,660
That's fucking...

2135
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,640
Yeah!

2136
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,600
That's a kill!

2137
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,440
That's fuck... I become the tank player.

2138
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:09,180
I...

2139
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,180
Oh shit.

2140
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:16,520
Whoops.

2141
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:23,530
Bam.

2142
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,770
I become the tank player!

2143
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,150
That's fucking right!

2144
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:32,590
He did this to me!

2145
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:36,830
He did this to me!

2146
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:44,690
He did this to me!

2147
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:49,140
Oh.

2148
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,640
That's not what I wanted, but that's fine.

2149
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:55,180
I wouldn't have done this, but I became the villain.

2150
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,450
I'm fucking cringe.

2151
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,190
I became...

2152
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:07,010
I become the cringe.

2153
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:09,470
Ha!

2154
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,160
That's right, Becky!

2155
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,220
Remember what you did, Becky!

2156
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:21,440
Oh.

2157
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,360
Wait, is he gone?

2158
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:25,640
Oh, he's gone.

2159
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:28,580
He's gone.

2160
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,140
Yeah, that's right.

2161
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:29,720
Get back here.

2162
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,680
That's fucking right!

2163
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:33,340
Get back here!

2164
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,120
No!

2165
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:35,940
No!

2166
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,660
Everybody's tank now!

2167
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,160
I created a monster.

2168
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,240
Not everybody's tank.

2169
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,640
My bad.

2170
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:52,390
I created a monster, guys.

2171
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:53,910
There's so many...

2172
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:55,030
I've ruined the lobby.

2173
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:57,470
I've ruined this lobby.

2174
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:02,150
I made everybody go tank.

2175
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:04,590
They all deserve it!

2176
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,890
The cycle continues.

2177
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:10,310
I created a cycle.

2178
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:11,890
Alright.

2179
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:14,730
I need to know what tank we're playing.

2180
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:17,530
Okay.

2181
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:18,450
Okay.

2182
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,130
We're not gonna have enough heals.

2183
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,210
I was gonna play Zenyatta, but...

2184
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:25,230
We're not gonna have enough heals.

2185
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:32,090
When everyone is cringe, No one else will be true.

2186
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:32,470
No one else will be true.

2187
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:33,170
Oh shit!

2188
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:33,490
Wait!

2189
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:34,490
Grandmaster tank?

2190
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:35,810
Alright.

2191
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:37,970
We have a Grandmaster tank now.

2192
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:39,290
Alright.

2193
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:40,970
Nice!

2194
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:43,330
Where the fuck are you here?

2195
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:44,850
That means he was GM last season.

2196
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:47,750
Does it take longer to class?

2197
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,110
Oh, it should because like...

2198
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:52,090
There's not enough Grandmasters right now.

2199
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:56,470
Yeah, I'm streamer mode, so my name is different every game.

2200
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:56,810
Yeah, I'm streamer mode, so my name is different every game.

2201
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:59,370
I only do that because I don't want to...

2202
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:00,430
I only do that because I don't want to...

2203
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,290
I don't want people to throw purposely.

2204
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:04,590
So that's why.

2205
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:10,780
What?

2206
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,060
I thought that would hit.

2207
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:13,420
I need to reload.

2208
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,980
I'm just surprised that didn't hit.

2209
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:19,800
Somebody...

2210
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,520
No!

2211
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:30,750
What?

2212
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:32,670
How did that not hit?

2213
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:36,670
I'm surprised that didn't hit.

2214
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:37,210
Not gonna lie.

2215
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,310
I'm just throwing sleeps randomly.

2216
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:40,390
That's not good.

2217
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:41,610
Oh god!

2218
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:44,850
Oh god.

2219
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,970
Sigma, I'm sorry.

2220
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:46,290
I'm sorry.

2221
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:46,630
Sigma.

2222
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:48,690
Oh, please!

2223
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:49,950
I'm getting juggled!

2224
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,150
I'm getting juggled right now!

2225
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:54,610
I'm a mess!

2226
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,670
Okay, I'm okay.

2227
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:57,570
I'm okay.

2228
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:59,030
I need to practice my sleeps.

2229
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,330
I have not been doing good sleeps.

2230
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:01,930
Already?

2231
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,370
He's dead.

2232
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:08,210
Please, he's one.

2233
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:09,070
He's literally one.

2234
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:10,650
He's literally one.

2235
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:11,610
Please, Sombra.

2236
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:12,250
Shoot him!

2237
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:15,430
I need to practice my...

2238
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:16,810
Wait, where has our Soldier been?

2239
01:35:17,010 --> 01:35:17,710
Not gonna lie.

2240
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:19,310
Where is our Soldier?

2241
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:21,390
I've not seen our Soldier this entire fight.

2242
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:22,310
I...

2243
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:26,250
I feel like I haven't seen our Soldier at all.

2244
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:27,150
Alright, he's dead.

2245
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:33,450
Alright, there you go.

2246
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,850
They have Junkrat Tire.

2247
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:37,150
100%.

2248
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:40,970
Please!

2249
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:43,870
We can't peek!

2250
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,560
Oh, okay.

2251
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,180
I'm swapping.

2252
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,160
We need Kiriko.

2253
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,500
Where has our Soldier been doing?

2254
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,760
I swear, I've not seen our Soldier at all.

2255
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,100
I'll find my own path.

2256
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:00,320
How's your Grandmaster doing?

2257
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,560
He's getting fucking bullied.

2258
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,660
That's what's happening.

2259
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,560
There's like so many fucking juggling aspects.

2260
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,420
Like, they still have Tire.

2261
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,000
Like, they still have Tire.

2262
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,040
Like, they still have Tire.

2263
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:13,560
Like, they still have Tire.

2264
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,660
Did they buff Ilari?

2265
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,040
Did they buff Ilari?

2266
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:21,220
Oh, he's so low!

2267
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,440
Did they buff Ilari?

2268
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:22,980
Did they buff her?

2269
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,040
Cause everybody's playing her right now.

2270
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:27,580
Oh.

2271
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:28,740
Goodbye.

2272
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:29,600
We're here.

2273
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,200
Don't worry, we can adjust!

2274
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:32,940
Right?

2275
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,860
Alright, Ilari.

2276
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,100
You can kill him, right?

2277
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,920
Oh, that's why everybody's playing Ilari.

2278
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:41,780
Okay.

2279
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,280
That makes a lot more sense.

2280
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,560
I was like, did she get buffed?

2281
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,520
Truly a hurt people hurt people moment.

2282
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:49,620
Truly a hurt people hurt people moment.

2283
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,520
Not so deadpool.

2284
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2285
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:51,700
Thank you.

2286
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:52,120
Thank you.

2287
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:53,960
What the fuck is... that's a good question.

2288
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,800
This is... our team is not playing together.

2289
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:58,880
And...

2290
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,040
Oh, Pharah-Junkrat combo.

2291
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,320
Wait, is that actually meta?

2292
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,200
I haven't been playing for a week.

2293
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,640
And they made Junkrat...

2294
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:10,180
Fuck.

2295
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,620
Junkrat-Phera meta?

2296
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:14,500
Really?

2297
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,820
They changed... literally I played a week ago.

2298
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,220
And this was not meta.

2299
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,080
Oh my god.

2300
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,200
I did not realize...

2301
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,700
So many things changed in one week.

2302
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:33,280
Literally stop playing for a week and this happens.

2303
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,100
This sucks.

2304
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,760
Now I have to learn Ilari.

2305
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:40,100
This fucking sucks.

2306
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:43,820
Alright.

2307
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,300
Oh, both our DPS is dead.

2308
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,600
Alright.

2309
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:49,200
I'm gonna go back to the game.

2310
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:51,060
Both our DPS is dead.

2311
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:53,600
Alright.

2312
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:55,500
Alright.

2313
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,200
Okay.

2314
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:58,940
I don't...

2315
01:37:58,940 --> 01:37:59,380
Alright.

2316
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:01,780
You know what?

2317
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,520
We don't need...

2318
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,560
We don't need our DPS.

2319
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,420
Oh no.

2320
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,000
Oh no.

2321
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,420
The one trap.

2322
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:15,280
The one fucking giant series.

2323
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:15,940
The one fucking giant series.

2324
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:16,920
The one fucking giant series.

2325
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,420
I'm so unlucky.

2326
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:20,320
I didn't see it.

2327
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,440
I didn't see it.

2328
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:23,200
Are you serious?

2329
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,080
I'm so unlucky.

2330
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,320
I'm so unlucky.

2331
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,020
Oh my god.

2332
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:33,800
Truly...

2333
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,140
There's no way.

2334
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:36,520
He farmed that fucking...

2335
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:39,560
He has been hammering our hog this entire fight.

2336
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,800
There's no way he does not have...

2337
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,120
Oh, alright.

2338
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,320
Guess I heal our DPS now too.

2339
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,240
Nice.

2340
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,260
Alright.

2341
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:52,520
Alright.

2342
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:55,780
Oh, there's the ult.

2343
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,760
There's the ult.

2344
01:38:59,080 --> 01:38:59,260
There's the ult.

2345
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:00,860
I'm fucking making sure I'm not with them.

2346
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,160
There it is.

2347
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,620
There he is.

2348
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:07,500
What?

2349
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:08,940
How?

2350
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,460
How does that hit me?

2351
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,200
How does that...

2352
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:17,150
Oh god.

2353
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,390
I'm staying up here.

2354
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:19,610
I'm in my safe zone.

2355
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:21,270
I'm in my safe zone.

2356
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:24,090
I'm in my safe zone.

2357
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:28,770
I'm in my safe zone.

2358
01:39:28,910 --> 01:39:29,130
I'm in my safe zone.

2359
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:29,610
Get in there.

2360
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:32,310
Keep stalling.

2361
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:35,610
I'm in my safe zone.

2362
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:36,830
I'm in my safe zone.

2363
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:39,650
Oh, hi.

2364
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:42,090
He's on me, but it's okay.

2365
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:43,430
Because we're still alive.

2366
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,650
Because we're still alive.

2367
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:47,550
Hog, we're still alive.

2368
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:48,410
That's okay.

2369
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:52,690
Oh, what a fucking hook.

2370
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:53,650
No.

2371
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:56,310
What a fucking hook.

2372
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:58,570
Jesus Christ.

2373
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:03,650
Oh my god!

2374
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,050
Please!

2375
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:10,550
Me and the hide.

2376
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:11,650
The dream team.

2377
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,490
I'm literally doing so much.

2378
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:15,190
What do you mean?

2379
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:16,490
Please clutch up.

2380
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:18,030
I'm surviving.

2381
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:21,490
You're fine.

2382
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:24,110
I can't believe they have tire.

2383
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:26,210
They have tire and they're so close.

2384
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:28,190
What is our DPS doing?

2385
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:29,630
That's the better question.

2386
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:32,550
I feel like our DPS is non-existent.

2387
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:33,650
It's just hogging me.

2388
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:37,990
Oh my god.

2389
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:40,130
Bro, he's one.

2390
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:41,530
Oh, the headshot though.

2391
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:42,470
Did you guys see the headshot?

2392
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:46,230
Bro, is this the first fucking soldier ult I've seen today?

2393
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:51,470
Is this the first fucking soldier ult I've seen today?

2394
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:57,120
Oh my god.

2395
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,620
They're doing their best.

2396
01:40:58,860 --> 01:40:59,160
They're doing their best.

2397
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,760
Just me and the hog.

2398
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:08,140
The hog and I literally survived so much.

2399
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,620
Oh my god.

2400
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:14,040
Bro, our fucking Ilari has worked damage at the other DPS.

2401
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:14,680
Bro, our fucking Ilari has worked damage at the other DPS.

2402
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,110
He's doing the work.

2403
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,040
He's doing the work.

2404
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,920
It's your turn to die.

2405
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:23,880
I'm gonna lock in.

2406
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,360
What the fuck is...

2407
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:28,040
Oh, it's our Symmetra.

2408
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,800
No, our Symmetra.

2409
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:32,600
Jesus Christ.

2410
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,680
Our soldier and Symmetra have not existed.

2411
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,020
Our soldier and Symmetra have not existed.

2412
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:37,380
I swear.

2413
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:39,160
I've not seen them.

2414
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,220
Oh my god.

2415
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,500
I'm glad I picked Kiriko.

2416
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:48,400
That Kiriko pick was actually...

2417
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,720
No way!

2418
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:53,720
No fucking way!

2419
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:54,340
No fucking way!

2420
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,380
I can't believe it.

2421
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,580
Nice.

2422
01:41:58,700 --> 01:41:59,520
Oh, hog.

2423
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,720
Me and the hog!

2424
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,340
Back at it again!

2425
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:03,840
Keep the hog alive!

2426
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:05,100
This is the...

2427
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,440
Keep hog alive!

2428
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:08,760
Save the hog!

2429
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:09,580
Save the world!

2430
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,000
Literally it.

2431
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:17,460
Actually getting hard carried by the hog right now.

2432
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,280
Oh, he's so close to dying too.

2433
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,940
I almost killed him.

2434
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:32,280
Nice.

2435
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:34,940
Don't worry, I got you!

2436
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,240
I won't get trapped this time!

2437
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,380
That's fucking right!

2438
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,420
That's right!

2439
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:45,900
Keep hog alive!

2440
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,740
Me and the hog!

2441
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,120
Dynamic duo!

2442
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:52,080
I like his new kit.

2443
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,020
I actually like the...

2444
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:54,320
What was it?

2445
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:55,220
The grid nade.

2446
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,220
Oh my god, he went hog.

2447
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,040
He went hog!

2448
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,600
Oh my god!

2449
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,500
He's so engi.

2450
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:07,060
He went Zenyatta!

2451
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:09,460
Oh my god, this is hard hog counter.

2452
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:12,840
Oh my god, he went Zenyatta!

2453
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:14,400
Oh my god, he went Zenyatta!

2454
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:14,980
Jesus Christ!

2455
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:19,620
Oh my god!

2456
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,580
That's fucked up.

2457
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,400
That's so fucked up.

2458
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,620
That's so fucked up.

2459
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,180
Oh my god, that's so fucked up!

2460
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:34,140
That's so fucked up.

2461
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,560
Oh, that is so fucked up.

2462
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:41,200
I didn't do this because I got scared I was gonna get hooked.

2463
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,820
I got scared.

2464
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:45,900
Okay.

2465
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:47,680
Okay.

2466
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:48,260
No hook.

2467
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,040
No hook, we're fine.

2468
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,140
He actually went full hog counter.

2469
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,140
That's actually scary as hell.

2470
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:57,060
That's fine.

2471
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,240
That's fine.

2472
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:58,960
Yeah!

2473
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,480
Oh my god!

2474
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:03,320
Okay, that's a little overkill but I'm fine with that.

2475
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,200
I'm fine with that.

2476
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,980
That was a little overkill.

2477
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,820
Be afraid.

2478
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:12,020
The fucking Kiriko ult.

2479
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,900
Oh, I thought that was the trap.

2480
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,400
The Kiriko ult.

2481
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:17,880
Hog ult for that one guy.

2482
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,460
The hog player.

2483
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:20,800
That poor...

2484
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,020
Oh my god, our Soldier did it!

2485
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,060
He gave us something!

2486
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:25,960
He got a killer!

2487
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:27,960
He...

2488
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,240
He still has Junkrat ult.

2489
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,580
He hasn't Junkrat ulted at all once.

2490
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,260
Oh my god.

2491
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:37,280
He gave us something!

2492
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,340
A win is a win.

2493
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,080
I'm gonna GG hog.

2494
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:44,700
You carried.

2495
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,100
I'm giving a compliment.

2496
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:50,780
I'm giving a compliment.

2497
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,160
Play of the day.

2498
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:55,620
I know!

2499
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,520
He's like, yep.

2500
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:10,540
It's him.

2501
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,260
He's so humble.

2502
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,380
He knows.

2503
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,400
That was a... yeah that felt like an uphill battle.

2504
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,260
It was me and the hog against the world.

2505
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,780
That 100% was...

2506
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,980
That felt like an uphill battle.

2507
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,080
That's me.

2508
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:26,500
No, no.

2509
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,640
He deserved that.

2510
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:28,760
Oh my god.

2511
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,000
Our DPS literally was non-existent.

2512
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,640
Our hog literally won v4'd everybody.

2513
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,200
Non-stop.

2514
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:37,820
It was crazy.

2515
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,960
He literally won v4'd.

2516
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,540
Oh this is a new lobby.

2517
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:45,560
That's fucking right.

2518
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:46,420
You tried to...

2519
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,320
Widow me?

2520
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:52,640
That's fucking right.

2521
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,680
You tried to tracer me?

2522
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:00,100
The Soldier Sim was actually wild though.

2523
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:00,540
The Soldier Sim was actually wild though.

2524
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:00,580
The Soldier Sim was actually wild though.

2525
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:02,740
Oh okay.

2526
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:05,120
I killed both of them so they two-timed.

2527
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,680
They double teamed.

2528
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:08,980
That...

2529
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:10,240
You know I deserved that.

2530
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,440
I 100% deserved that.

2531
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,260
I killed both of them individually so they teamed up.

2532
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,020
I killed both of them individually so they teamed up.

2533
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,160
Is he on D.Va?

2534
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:18,540
Is he on D.Va?

2535
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,720
Who hurt him?

2536
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:24,480
Oh I did not mean to...

2537
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:29,040
I did not mean to right click.

2538
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,380
It was a mis-input.

2539
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:34,790
Alright.

2540
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:35,590
Widow.

2541
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:36,690
Nice try.

2542
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:38,790
Nice try tracer.

2543
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:41,030
Okay!

2544
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:45,570
Am I 1v5?

2545
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:47,850
Is this a 1v5?

2546
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:48,790
I'm like...

2547
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:50,890
They all came after me?

2548
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,930
How the fuck was I supposed to kill...

2549
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:59,210
3 people back to back to back with no heals?

2550
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:02,430
That was fucked up.

2551
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:04,010
That was actually fucked up.

2552
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:05,350
I'm gonna help you.

2553
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:06,530
Just fuck this D.Va.

2554
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:08,810
Fuck this D.Va in particular.

2555
01:47:09,010 --> 01:47:09,530
Actually...

2556
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:14,450
Fuck this D.Va in particularly.

2557
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,410
Oh my...

2558
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:19,230
Yeah.

2559
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:21,050
Fuck this D.Va in particularly.

2560
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:22,550
Yeah.

2561
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,750
Fuck this D.Va in particularly.

2562
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:24,050
Yeah.

2563
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:24,750
Fuck this D.Va in particularly.

2564
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:25,050
Yeah.

2565
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:31,750
That's right.

2566
01:47:31,810 --> 01:47:32,010
Yeah.

2567
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:32,010
That's right.

2568
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:33,570
Get ready for...

2569
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:33,910
Get ready for...

2570
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:34,650
A better...

2571
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:40,590
I almost have a better strafe.

2572
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:41,030
I almost have a better strafe.

2573
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:41,670
I almost...

2574
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:43,530
It was close.

2575
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:46,910
Now I'm getting away from this fucking Orisa.

2576
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:48,430
Climb up the stairs Orisa.

2577
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:51,530
This... but this...

2578
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:52,730
Y'all friendly?

2579
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:53,730
Bro this is deathmatch.

2580
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:54,910
Go to a skirmish.

2581
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:56,730
If you want friendly matchup.

2582
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:59,470
That's what skirmish... Holy shit!

2583
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:01,030
How is he still chasing me?

2584
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:03,530
Leave me alone!

2585
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:04,430
I'm just gonna run!

2586
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:12,550
There we go.

2587
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,890
Leave me alone.

2588
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:18,350
Oh that was a good shot.

2589
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,130
Let me full heal.

2590
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:24,210
That was a real...

2591
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:27,130
Yeah?

2592
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:29,710
That's fucking right.

2593
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:32,770
That's fucking right.

2594
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:35,250
I think there's no Zen here to kick me off.

2595
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:38,130
That's why he chases you.

2596
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:41,550
You chase me, I run away.

2597
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:43,230
It's simple rules.

2598
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:45,430
It's the law of the land.

2599
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:48,270
I hear somebody here.

2600
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:49,450
I hear a Mora.

2601
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:51,870
No heals for you.

2602
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:53,550
Is that D.Va in there with the Mora?

2603
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:02,080
It's fucked up.

2604
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,620
I thought I was being smart!

2605
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:13,340
I thought I was being smart!

2606
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,240
I was like...

2607
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:15,140
Oh I can't... I can't...

2608
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:16,600
It's him!

2609
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,480
It's the tank abuser!

2610
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:20,900
I just realized it's him again!

2611
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:23,940
It's the motherfucking tank abuser!

2612
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:26,720
That made me into the monster I am!

2613
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:28,460
Oh my god.

2614
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,100
I'm going Zarya.

2615
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:29,780
Fuck this.

2616
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:31,040
Bro.

2617
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,480
I'm going to be part of the problem.

2618
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,660
I'm going to be...

2619
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,020
It's him!

2620
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,960
It's him again!

2621
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,000
I'm going to be part of the problem.

2622
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,940
That's fucking right.

2623
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,800
I have better tracking than you, bitch.

2624
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,120
Oh you're scared now.

2625
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:57,160
Wait that's not fair.

2626
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,900
Oh you're scared now.

2627
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,460
That's fucking right.

2628
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:03,440
I have good tracking.

2629
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:04,860
Oh he left.

2630
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:06,860
Okay.

2631
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,240
This is fucked up.

2632
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,920
Because I have to track two Genjis now.

2633
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:13,400
That's fucking right.

2634
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:14,380
Give me that energy.

2635
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:14,960
Oh okay.

2636
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:23,080
He keeps abusing tank in fucking deathmatch!

2637
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:26,760
I had to teach him a lesson but I couldn't find the D.Va.

2638
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,880
He was right last time.

2639
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,760
I literally bumped into him again!

2640
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:37,760
Oh my gosh.

2641
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:38,880
I'm sad.

2642
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:40,940
I couldn't find the D.Va to teach her a lesson again.

2643
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,260
I'm sad.

2644
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:43,260
I couldn't find the D.Va to teach her a lesson again.

2645
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:44,140
Alright where are you playing?

2646
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:45,200
Venture.

2647
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,240
That's an interesting pick.

2648
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,760
I feel like I haven't seen Venture in a long time.

2649
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,520
I don't want to learn Ilari right now.

2650
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:57,480
I haven't actually played Ilari in a while.

2651
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,040
I haven't actually played Ilari in a while.

2652
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,180
I didn't realize.

2653
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:01,280
If I knew I was going to fucking buff Ilari.

2654
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:04,260
Is it...

2655
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,320
Is it a Symmetra?

2656
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:07,560
Wait who was on my team last game?

2657
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:08,200
Was it him?

2658
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:09,220
No.

2659
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,460
Okay I'm going to avoid this guy.

2660
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,720
Okay I'm gonna avoid this guy.

2661
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:13,620
This guy did nothing.

2662
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:16,960
This guy was actually useless.

2663
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:19,200
Oh.

2664
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:20,460
Oh Lucio Junker.

2665
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:20,840
Okay.

2666
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:22,380
That makes sense.

2667
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:24,840
That makes sense.

2668
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:26,440
We have Lucio Junker.

2669
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:33,370
Oh.

2670
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:37,390
Oh, but we're taking so much damage.

2671
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:42,690
We're taking so much damage.

2672
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:48,290
Oh my god, he's also... wait, he's so low!

2673
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:50,070
What do I have to play?

2674
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:51,910
Okay, I should play Bap then if it's Lucio.

2675
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:53,130
God damn it.

2676
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:57,050
All right, I didn't even realize we had Junker.

2677
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:03,630
Come on guys, maybe we shouldn't be in this cubby hole!

2678
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:06,330
Maybe we shouldn't!

2679
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:07,390
Go right, go right, go right, go right!

2680
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:09,750
Yeah, why are you still... exactly!

2681
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:11,950
Go right, go right, go right, go right!

2682
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:17,930
Okay, that's fine.

2683
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:21,610
Whoa, we did it!

2684
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:25,930
We did have to go right, guys!

2685
01:52:27,050 --> 01:52:28,250
We did have to go right!

2686
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:31,330
Guys, I will get the sleep.

2687
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:33,510
Guys, the moment I hit a sleep, we celebrate.

2688
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:43,050
The moment I hit one sleep, we fucking celebrate.

2689
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:48,790
No!

2690
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:52,990
It's fine, we still win this.

2691
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:55,290
Let's see it.

2692
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,690
We fucking celebrate.

2693
01:52:58,430 --> 01:52:59,710
Guys, it's been a while.

2694
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:03,470
I don't know why, but I'm not hitting sleeps today.

2695
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:06,430
Guys, I used to be so good at sleeps.

2696
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:08,770
Guys, it's okay.

2697
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:10,210
I can do everything else.

2698
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:14,150
Sleeps don't matter as much as I say I sleep.

2699
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:15,690
Matter so much.

2700
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,590
Guys, guys!

2701
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:27,150
Guys!

2702
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:29,870
That's fucked up.

2703
01:53:30,150 --> 01:53:31,690
That was so fucked up.

2704
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:33,210
That would have hit!

2705
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:33,290
That would have hit!

2706
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:38,850
That 100... guys, you know damn well that would have hit if he didn't fucking face.

2707
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:42,170
If he didn't face, that was 100% a hit.

2708
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:46,370
Oh shit.

2709
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:47,470
Wait, did we use B?

2710
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:49,030
Oh, we did.

2711
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:50,510
I should go back soon.

2712
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:52,350
Um...

2713
01:53:52,350 --> 01:53:55,150
Hey guys, I'm gonna live here for a sec.

2714
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:57,070
Yeah!

2715
01:53:58,770 --> 01:53:59,250
Okay.

2716
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:03,250
Guys, I did it.

2717
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:03,890
I did it, guys!

2718
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:06,190
I did it.

2719
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:08,550
Oh my god.

2720
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:11,170
Okay, here we go.

2721
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,790
I have to go BAP because we're running Lucio.

2722
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:15,750
Junker.

2723
01:54:16,110 --> 01:54:18,030
It simply is the way.

2724
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:25,120
If we weren't running Lucio BAP, I would run somebody else.

2725
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:28,700
What the fuck is going on?

2726
01:54:35,890 --> 01:54:37,570
I did nothing!

2727
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:38,470
I did nothing.

2728
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:42,410
I did not think I needed to use that.

2729
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,140
Guys, can we not be here?

2730
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,560
Can we go main?

2731
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:51,320
Guys!

2732
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:53,640
Yeah, can we go main?

2733
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:54,360
Can we go main?

2734
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:58,320
Guys, he doesn't want to guard.

2735
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:00,460
The tank doesn't want it though.

2736
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,880
The tank doesn't want to.

2737
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:09,380
You're welcome!

2738
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,500
Oh my god!

2739
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:12,640
Thank god I was back!

2740
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:17,740
Please!

2741
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:20,220
For the love of god!

2742
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:24,340
For the love of god!

2743
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:26,000
Jeez, cool price.

2744
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,380
Oh my god.

2745
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:33,460
Oh my god.

2746
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,820
Oh my god.

2747
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:39,000
I was so insistent on the fucking...

2748
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:39,380
Why?

2749
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,920
Oh god, I'm debating.

2750
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:48,500
I was like, maybe they have Reaper ult though.

2751
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,160
So...

2752
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:50,520
Oh no, I don't feel...

2753
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,260
Guys, guys, back up guys!

2754
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:53,560
Back up!

2755
01:55:58,820 --> 01:55:59,700
Oh shit.

2756
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:02,520
Oh, this is not good.

2757
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:04,980
This is not good.

2758
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:05,780
I don't have lamp for it.

2759
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:06,920
Yep.

2760
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,960
Why didn't I have lamp for that?

2761
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:09,780
No!

2762
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,800
Why didn't you beat earlier?

2763
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:17,820
I thought the Reaper was going to TP onto us.

2764
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:21,160
I felt it.

2765
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:23,840
Lucy, why didn't you ult earlier?

2766
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:27,760
You could have ulted and saved us!

2767
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:33,290
Oh my god.

2768
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:35,230
You could have ulted and saved us.

2769
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:36,570
Oh my god.

2770
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:39,290
You could have ulted and saved us.

2771
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:41,150
He does do it if it's behind the wall.

2772
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:43,110
If I have the lamp behind the wall.

2773
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:45,290
Before he gets in.

2774
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:46,630
It was better than nothing, you know?

2775
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:49,110
Please, I don't...

2776
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:50,010
I'm going to run here.

2777
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:50,750
Go fuck this.

2778
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:52,050
Oh, okay.

2779
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:52,770
He's on Hammond.

2780
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:53,350
Thank god.

2781
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,690
Okay.

2782
01:56:57,570 --> 01:56:57,970
Oh.

2783
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:01,530
The only way to live that was to lose the ult.

2784
01:57:02,150 --> 01:57:03,330
There's nothing else I could do.

2785
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:06,410
I also put that here... put that there for also the Cassidy.

2786
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:07,510
Thank you, no.

2787
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:08,010
You can come.

2788
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:11,270
Oh my god.

2789
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:15,030
Is our tank the only one not in the voice chat?

2790
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:15,490
Is our tank the only one not in the voice chat?

2791
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:16,410
Is that why?

2792
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:22,180
Yep.

2793
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,300
The very save.

2794
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,020
Alright, good luck, Cassidy.

2795
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:30,380
We're trying to save your ass right now.

2796
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:30,860
We're trying to save your ass right now.

2797
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,040
Like...

2798
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,280
God, if he wasn't on...

2799
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,120
God, if he wasn't on...

2800
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:38,680
If he wasn't on Lucio, I would run Zenyatta.

2801
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,040
For this Rein.

2802
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:42,720
Nice.

2803
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:44,060
Oh, we got... we got somebody.

2804
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:46,700
I need to save this cleanse though.

2805
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,000
Nice, we got two.

2806
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,020
Nice, we got...

2807
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:51,800
A legitimate thought.

2808
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:52,640
Okay.

2809
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:54,940
Literally the wrong one to...

2810
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,860
Literally the wrong person to boot.

2811
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:04,820
I don't... I don't know what that Lucio was trying to do.

2812
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:08,060
But that was the wrong player to boot.

2813
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:08,960
That's for sure.

2814
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,440
I don't think I can.

2815
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:13,880
I don't think I can.

2816
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:17,120
I'm just making sure that I don't get hit on the side.

2817
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,420
Wait, what?

2818
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:21,540
Oh god.

2819
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:24,300
Did I not hit?

2820
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:24,600
No!

2821
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:28,560
No.

2822
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:31,820
You're okay, you're okay.

2823
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:32,720
You're so healthy.

2824
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:34,600
You're so healthy.

2825
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,460
Where the fuck is the Rein?

2826
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:39,700
You're so healthy, Lucio.

2827
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:41,280
You're so healthy too.

2828
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:43,720
Catch my... Catch my heals!

2829
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,240
Just catch the heals!

2830
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:53,130
Catch it!

2831
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:54,310
What?

2832
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,660
Catch the heals!

2833
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:02,820
Alright, nice.

2834
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,180
We're fine.

2835
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,220
That's all they need to do.

2836
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:08,000
Never play Overwatch.

2837
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:11,280
The great thing is I'm already a streamer so I don't have...

2838
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,100
Stable mental health.

2839
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:14,220
Stable mental health.

2840
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:15,480
I mean, okay.

2841
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,360
Alright.

2842
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:19,740
Let's see.

2843
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:21,320
Woo!

2844
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:24,660
Alright.

2845
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,340
Let's go.

2846
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:26,940
It'll be fine.

2847
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:29,820
Oh my god.

2848
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,360
I am not fine.

2849
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,040
Not fine.

2850
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:39,340
I hoped I was gonna be fine but I was definitely...

2851
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:40,320
I don't know.

2852
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:43,280
I saw that Lucio face tanking a lot.

2853
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:43,640
I...

2854
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:45,420
Yay!

2855
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:51,170
I'm a streamer.

2856
01:59:51,190 --> 01:59:52,930
We're not known to be mentally stable.

2857
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:58,830
I would be surprised if there is a streamer in this world that has good mental health.

2858
02:00:00,350 --> 02:00:02,110
That doesn't exist when you stream.

2859
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:03,990
It's like the curse.

2860
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:05,750
Is he still... Yeah, I fucking knew it.

2861
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:07,530
I was like, I think he has ult.

2862
02:00:07,990 --> 02:00:11,790
I was like, I'm pretty sure.

2863
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:14,210
What?

2864
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:15,890
I clapped my hands!

2865
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:17,890
I clapped it!

2866
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:24,030
Oh, nice.

2867
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:25,790
Nice, they don't have speed.

2868
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:26,330
He doesn't have speed!

2869
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:27,210
Go, go, go, go, go!

2870
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:28,490
He has no speed!

2871
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:32,040
What?

2872
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:35,030
Lucio, you fucking...

2873
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:38,090
He Ajaxed twice.

2874
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:39,770
That was...

2875
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:40,450
He...

2876
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:42,430
He fucking...

2877
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:43,930
He's done it though!

2878
02:00:44,330 --> 02:00:45,430
Yeah, yeah.

2879
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:47,650
That seems right.

2880
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:48,730
Yeah, you should.

2881
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:52,870
You should 100% go Zenyatta after that.

2882
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:53,590
Yeah.

2883
02:00:55,650 --> 02:00:59,930
Yeah, after what I fucking saw, you fucking should go Zenyatta.

2884
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:06,510
Yeah.

2885
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:06,590
Yeah.

2886
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:10,390
Oh my god, I swear to god.

2887
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,350
He's good.

2888
02:01:12,830 --> 02:01:13,550
He should.

2889
02:01:13,730 --> 02:01:14,550
He was not good.

2890
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:15,350
He...

2891
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:23,530
That... Our Lucio was not a good Lucio play.

2892
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:25,870
He wasted his ult twice.

2893
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:27,850
I saw it too.

2894
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:35,420
Oh man, I didn't... I thought I could...

2895
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,740
I thought he was gonna...

2896
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:38,540
Oh no, I have to reload.

2897
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:39,740
No, he didn't...

2898
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,200
Okay.

2899
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:46,700
That is interesting.

2900
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:49,820
Okay, that is very... I have to die.

2901
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:50,960
That's unlucky.

2902
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:52,460
That's so unlucky.

2903
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:54,600
I was so confused what the play was.

2904
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:58,760
I was very confused what the play was for this team.

2905
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:00,980
Yeah, that's a GG's.

2906
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:06,040
That is 100% a GG's.

2907
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:07,680
We had a really bad Lucio.

2908
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,040
We... Okay.

2909
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:11,000
Hahaha.

2910
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:15,720
We had a really bad support party.

2911
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:17,380
Oh my god.

2912
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:19,560
We lost... beat twice.

2913
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,420
In this one game.

2914
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:25,560
Oh my god.

2915
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,800
No, we don't deserve that.

2916
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:29,400
Alright, it's time to play the game.

2917
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:30,660
Of...

2918
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:32,740
Avoid Day.

2919
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,440
Okay.

2920
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:35,120
Where's my avoids?

2921
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:35,540
Alright.

2922
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:37,600
Okay.

2923
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:38,940
Who is this guy again?

2924
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:42,440
This guy... Oh, this one was the DPS that argued with the Zarya.

2925
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:43,020
Okay.

2926
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:45,260
I...

2927
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,840
rather avoid the shitty support player.

2928
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:50,960
That was a terrible support partner.

2929
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,620
That was not a great support partner at all.

2930
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,360
I did!

2931
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:55,400
I hit one sleep.

2932
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:56,460
Hahaha.

2933
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:00,680
I hit one sleep, guys.

2934
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:01,280
I did.

2935
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:08,140
I just had... My support partner just wasted his Lucio beat like three times during games that we needed.

2936
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,620
Like, during last...

2937
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:12,700
Like, he wasted Lucio beats during last fights twice.

2938
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,320
That's why he gets the avoid.

2939
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,400
A sleep that meant nothing.

2940
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:22,100
It's okay.

2941
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:22,840
A sleep is a sleep.

2942
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:24,620
At least it wasn't an ult.

2943
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:25,540
I wasted an ability.

2944
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:26,900
He wasted an ult.

2945
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:31,080
An ult waste always has more of a precedence.

2946
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:34,380
Maybe I should play Ana to practice.

2947
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:36,660
Okay.

2948
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:41,490
That just means that I deserve that.

2949
02:03:41,670 --> 02:03:42,190
Hahaha.

2950
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:45,110
Hahaha.

2951
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:48,930
That was mean.

2952
02:03:49,150 --> 02:03:50,950
I deserve getting killed there.

2953
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,030
Oh.

2954
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:55,010
Okay.

2955
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:55,690
I fell down.

2956
02:03:56,150 --> 02:03:57,230
I slipped down.

2957
02:03:58,530 --> 02:03:59,390
What the f...

2958
02:03:59,390 --> 02:03:59,950
That's fucked up.

2959
02:04:00,810 --> 02:04:01,810
That's fucked up!

2960
02:04:01,930 --> 02:04:02,230
Okay.

2961
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:03,290
I'm gonna practice Ana sleeps.

2962
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:04,730
That's right.

2963
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:05,670
I'm gonna do it.

2964
02:04:07,630 --> 02:04:09,450
It's time to practice Ana sleeps.

2965
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,070
No!

2966
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:16,550
No!

2967
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:17,830
I'm fucking around it.

2968
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:20,170
I'm fucking bullying this guy again.

2969
02:04:22,050 --> 02:04:23,310
I need to stop doing that.

2970
02:04:25,390 --> 02:04:26,350
I hear them.

2971
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:29,170
Okay.

2972
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:30,430
That should have hit.

2973
02:04:30,990 --> 02:04:31,430
Hahaha.

2974
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:33,550
That should have hit.

2975
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:35,470
I don't care what anybody said.

2976
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:37,450
That sleep should have 100% hit.

2977
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:41,110
That's fucking right Genji.

2978
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:43,670
I can aim on Ana.

2979
02:04:43,870 --> 02:04:44,850
I just can't sleep.

2980
02:04:47,150 --> 02:04:48,750
I can't see.

2981
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:49,150
I can't see.

2982
02:04:49,150 --> 02:04:49,230
Oh.

2983
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:52,430
Oh you're scared?

2984
02:04:52,730 --> 02:04:53,590
You're scared?

2985
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:54,830
That's fucking right.

2986
02:04:54,910 --> 02:04:55,510
You should be.

2987
02:04:55,970 --> 02:04:57,710
You should be scared.

2988
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,950
Hahaha.

2989
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:01,150
Hahaha.

2990
02:05:02,710 --> 02:05:04,250
That's fucking right.

2991
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:08,290
You're scared again?

2992
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:10,630
That's fucking right.

2993
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:11,490
Hahaha.

2994
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:11,910
Hahaha.

2995
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:13,770
Hahaha.

2996
02:05:14,350 --> 02:05:15,790
I did sleep though.

2997
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:16,990
I slept him.

2998
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:18,590
You wanna try that again?

2999
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:20,290
Yeah?

3000
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:21,610
Are you scared?

3001
02:05:21,950 --> 02:05:22,710
Oh you're scared.

3002
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:24,710
Hahaha.

3003
02:05:25,550 --> 02:05:26,190
Hahaha.

3004
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,230
Hahaha.

3005
02:05:29,230 --> 02:05:30,350
That's fucking right.

3006
02:05:32,630 --> 02:05:33,610
Don't do that.

3007
02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:36,170
Don't fucking try and push me again.

3008
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:39,150
Jesus Christ.

3009
02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:39,490
Okay.

3010
02:05:39,690 --> 02:05:41,290
One at a time.

3011
02:05:41,610 --> 02:05:42,050
Hahaha.

3012
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:44,830
One at a time.

3013
02:05:45,310 --> 02:05:46,110
Hahaha.

3014
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:48,490
That's fucking bullshit.

3015
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:49,830
I got two time there.

3016
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:51,130
Every time.

3017
02:05:52,890 --> 02:05:53,910
Get away.

3018
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:55,430
Get away.

3019
02:05:56,030 --> 02:05:57,130
You're bad.

3020
02:06:00,610 --> 02:06:01,410
Oh.

3021
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:02,930
No.

3022
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:04,010
No.

3023
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:08,910
That's fucking right.

3024
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:10,570
That's fucking right.

3025
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,890
That's fucking right.

3026
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:15,010
Yeah?

3027
02:06:15,470 --> 02:06:16,910
That's fucking right!

3028
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:18,090
Get out!

3029
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:21,070
Hahaha.

3030
02:06:22,630 --> 02:06:23,410
Hahaha.

3031
02:06:25,070 --> 02:06:27,090
I might not haveodo sleep.

3032
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:29,770
But everything else.

3033
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:35,510
That's fucking right!

3034
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:37,070
Oh.

3035
02:06:37,110 --> 02:06:37,270
Yeah.

3036
02:06:45,310 --> 02:06:47,570
You can only alt yourself in deathmatch.

3037
02:06:48,010 --> 02:06:49,870
It's only in deathmatch.

3038
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:54,630
That was scary though.

3039
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:56,450
That was very scary.

3040
02:06:56,730 --> 02:06:58,390
I thought I was gonna die to the chaser.

3041
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:01,170
Get shit on.

3042
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:06,610
I might not be able to hit sleeves, but I hit everything else.

3043
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:14,530
Look, I had to fucking kill so many.

3044
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:18,030
I literally killed three people in a row.

3045
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:19,830
I don't know if I could get the fourth in.

3046
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:29,650
I love the streamer mode names.

3047
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:33,350
Those Genjis.

3048
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:35,390
So embarrassing for those Genjis.

3049
02:07:36,110 --> 02:07:36,590
Actually.

3050
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:37,090
Actually embarrassing.

3051
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:39,410
My god.

3052
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:41,110
Should go back to the training range.

3053
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:46,730
Oh, we have MAGA!

3054
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:49,650
MAGA time!

3055
02:07:52,310 --> 02:07:52,870
Alright.

3056
02:07:53,090 --> 02:07:55,850
I haven't encountered a tank that counterswaps yet.

3057
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:57,610
Which is crazy.

3058
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:02,850
Literally all the other games I've had, it was basically non-stop tank swapping.

3059
02:08:03,170 --> 02:08:04,210
So it's nice!

3060
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:05,170
Oh, Ana.

3061
02:08:06,610 --> 02:08:07,670
Ana, you killed us.

3062
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:10,130
You actually killed us, Ana.

3063
02:08:11,410 --> 02:08:12,590
You killed Ana.

3064
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:13,430
You killed us.

3065
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:16,250
I'm going Kiriko.

3066
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:17,630
I mean, Ana.

3067
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:21,090
Alright.

3068
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:22,350
It's Kiriko time.

3069
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:25,390
Ana actually fucked us up.

3070
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:29,970
If I had cleanse, we would have lived.

3071
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:32,230
But I sadly did not.

3072
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:34,870
I'm running double hits again.

3073
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:35,330
Okay.

3074
02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:36,690
Oh no.

3075
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:39,690
Double hits cannon against Doomfist.

3076
02:08:40,070 --> 02:08:41,810
There you go.

3077
02:08:48,950 --> 02:08:50,310
Wait, where's our tank?

3078
02:08:50,930 --> 02:08:51,530
Oh!

3079
02:08:52,110 --> 02:08:53,790
Our tank is on point!

3080
02:08:54,150 --> 02:08:55,890
Why is he on point?

3081
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:59,890
Why is our tank not playing with us?

3082
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:05,550
You're lucky I saved your... Okay.

3083
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:08,310
Guys, I think this is a tank.

3084
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:08,610
Team death.

3085
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:13,070
I think our team is garbage.

3086
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:19,070
Guys, we have a pretty bad tank, guys.

3087
02:09:19,310 --> 02:09:19,690
I think.

3088
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:23,810
Our tank is just W king, so we're going to have to follow him.

3089
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:27,610
I think our tank is not good.

3090
02:09:29,690 --> 02:09:30,650
Pardon for going last.

3091
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:32,790
Please, I can't.

3092
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:35,170
Please, I picked Sigma.

3093
02:09:36,290 --> 02:09:36,930
No!

3094
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:37,570
What?

3095
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:39,730
Who gave this tank everything?

3096
02:09:41,290 --> 02:09:42,350
What's his charge?

3097
02:09:44,190 --> 02:09:45,650
What is his charge?

3098
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:47,670
Who gave him every fucking utility?

3099
02:09:48,450 --> 02:09:50,090
Who shot his punch?

3100
02:09:51,490 --> 02:09:52,810
No, it's because like...

3101
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:55,310
The thing is, if you shoot his block...

3102
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:58,530
He had... I think he had max charge, right?

3103
02:09:59,050 --> 02:10:02,170
Because like... It fucking gets so much damage.

3104
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:04,430
Somebody shot his punch.

3105
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:08,170
Because like, if his punch is almost maxed out, you can insta...

3106
02:10:08,170 --> 02:10:10,450
Okay, I'm not...

3107
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:12,010
But you can't do anything about it.

3108
02:10:12,470 --> 02:10:12,950
Basically.

3109
02:10:13,650 --> 02:10:14,470
He has ult.

3110
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:15,650
Mei has ult too.

3111
02:10:18,090 --> 02:10:19,730
Alright, they're going to Mei ult now.

3112
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:23,090
Okay.

3113
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:25,350
I...

3114
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:26,210
Alright.

3115
02:10:26,490 --> 02:10:27,530
I mean, that's great.

3116
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:30,670
Alright.

3117
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:32,530
I tried my best.

3118
02:10:33,070 --> 02:10:34,370
He punched me out!

3119
02:10:34,770 --> 02:10:35,650
I collapsed!

3120
02:10:36,370 --> 02:10:37,030
I collapsed!

3121
02:10:40,110 --> 02:10:41,590
I literally collapsed!

3122
02:10:43,770 --> 02:10:44,710
I collapsed!

3123
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:48,590
This is a good Doomfist, whoever he is.

3124
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:52,210
I saw it!

3125
02:10:52,390 --> 02:10:53,750
You guys saw it too!

3126
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:54,850
What server am I on?

3127
02:10:54,990 --> 02:10:55,510
Oh, I'm on East Coast.

3128
02:10:55,610 --> 02:10:56,170
That makes sense.

3129
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:56,550
Okay.

3130
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:57,950
I'm on East Coast servers.

3131
02:11:00,910 --> 02:11:02,270
That makes sense.

3132
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:04,950
That makes a lot of sense.

3133
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:05,690
Nice.

3134
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:06,910
Alright.

3135
02:11:09,070 --> 02:11:10,010
Alright, we got...

3136
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:11,410
We backed him off for one fight.

3137
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:12,430
That's all that matters.

3138
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:15,570
Alright.

3139
02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:18,590
This Doom is scary though.

3140
02:11:19,590 --> 02:11:20,770
Oh, I have to use that.

3141
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:21,790
I was so scared.

3142
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:22,490
I didn't want to die.

3143
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:23,470
It's okay.

3144
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:25,110
He'll be fine.

3145
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:27,870
Nearly wasted anti.

3146
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:29,850
They used Doom ult.

3147
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:30,970
They still have Mei ult.

3148
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:32,030
Um...

3149
02:11:32,030 --> 02:11:33,010
They still have Blade.

3150
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:35,150
Okay.

3151
02:11:35,770 --> 02:11:36,450
Alright.

3152
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:37,250
That...

3153
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:37,690
Okay!

3154
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:41,490
Oh!

3155
02:11:41,490 --> 02:11:42,070
Alright!

3156
02:11:42,270 --> 02:11:43,270
Let me just get bullied!

3157
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:48,930
Okay.

3158
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:50,110
Alright.

3159
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:53,570
Oh!

3160
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:54,790
Our Winston is still alive!

3161
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:58,980
Oh!

3162
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:03,860
Easy.

3163
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:04,720
Oh!

3164
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:05,000
Oh!

3165
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:05,020
Oh!

3166
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:05,040
Oh!

3167
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:05,420
Easy.

3168
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:06,360
Holy...

3169
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:13,920
Somebody is giving this Doomfist max charge and it's not me.

3170
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:17,680
Because I'm trying to fucking keep everybody alive right now.

3171
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,260
Somebody is giving that Doom max charge.

3172
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:27,540
Who is it?

3173
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:32,420
That Doom has so much charge for his punch.

3174
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:34,620
True.

3175
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:35,260
It might be the turret.

3176
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:39,300
I think our doom is just farming our torb's turret.

3177
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:40,880
That makes more sense.

3178
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:41,900
Yeah!

3179
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:45,020
They nerfed our ship?

3180
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,820
Yeah, it's so hard to shift right now.

3181
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:50,060
It's like... I need to time it better.

3182
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:51,920
The ship is so fat.

3183
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:56,180
It's so slow compared to before.

3184
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,860
Because I clapped and I still get punched.

3185
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:01,800
Which is frustrating.

3186
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:08,580
I think it sucks when you have to relearn characters and timing and stuff.

3187
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:10,760
Especially like not playing at...

3188
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:14,060
The thing is I literally didn't play for a week and they changed so much!

3189
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,360
That's the most frustrating part!

3190
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:20,540
They changed so much after a week!

3191
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:22,900
I didn't realize.

3192
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:27,080
Somebody...

3193
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,780
I am keeping you up as long as you can.

3194
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:34,600
Please keep surviving!

3195
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:45,180
When you play support a lot, especially the characters that are meta and they change one thing.

3196
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:47,180
Even something small like seconds.

3197
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:52,420
It affects a lot because you have inner timing, reflex timing.

3198
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:56,960
So for me, I have reflex timing for certain abilities.

3199
02:13:57,320 --> 02:14:01,780
So it throws me off so much when they change things.

3200
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:02,480
One thing.

3201
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:05,300
Because I'm not used to it.

3202
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:06,940
Alright!

3203
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:08,880
I'm trying to keep you up right now!

3204
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:10,440
Oh!

3205
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:11,180
That...

3206
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:13,180
That guy has so much...

3207
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:13,980
Charge!

3208
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:15,540
Please somebody touch it!

3209
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:17,340
I can't touch it!

3210
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,820
I'm trying to keep you up right now!

3211
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:20,720
Woo!

3212
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:21,940
Woo!

3213
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:24,180
Goodbye!

3214
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:26,320
Please!

3215
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:28,200
I'm literally running around!

3216
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:29,620
Hahaha!

3217
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:32,980
Oh my god!

3218
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:38,710
Oh my god!

3219
02:14:39,770 --> 02:14:41,670
My internal timing!

3220
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:46,210
I have to manually adjust myself.

3221
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:50,310
Because I can't use internal reflex.

3222
02:14:50,790 --> 02:14:51,730
Oh god!

3223
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:53,230
Get me away!

3224
02:14:53,370 --> 02:14:54,710
Get me away from that Doom!

3225
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:57,570
I feel like if I let that Doom touch me just once, it's over.

3226
02:14:58,150 --> 02:14:58,390
Hahaha!

3227
02:14:58,990 --> 02:15:00,190
It's actually...

3228
02:15:00,190 --> 02:15:01,130
Oh god!

3229
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:02,170
Oh god!

3230
02:15:02,290 --> 02:15:02,610
Goodbye!

3231
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:03,390
Hahaha!

3232
02:15:04,450 --> 02:15:04,950
Woo!

3233
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,560
Woo!

3234
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:11,520
Please!

3235
02:15:15,530 --> 02:15:17,350
What the fuck!

3236
02:15:17,690 --> 02:15:18,310
Hahaha!

3237
02:15:19,390 --> 02:15:20,390
Hahaha!

3238
02:15:21,310 --> 02:15:23,730
The doofus PTSD!

3239
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:26,610
Get away from me!

3240
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:28,070
Get away from me!

3241
02:15:28,650 --> 02:15:29,650
Hahaha!

3242
02:15:32,530 --> 02:15:34,450
Why you even do that?

3243
02:15:34,710 --> 02:15:36,090
Now they don't have an Ana.

3244
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:36,770
Oh!

3245
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:38,350
Oh nice!

3246
02:15:40,730 --> 02:15:41,150
Nice!

3247
02:15:43,730 --> 02:15:44,750
Oh god!

3248
02:15:44,830 --> 02:15:45,970
I see the Doom!

3249
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:48,210
I thought he was gonna punch me!

3250
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:48,970
Hahaha!

3251
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:51,910
I reflexively...

3252
02:15:51,910 --> 02:15:52,950
Um...

3253
02:15:52,950 --> 02:15:53,570
Hahaha!

3254
02:15:55,490 --> 02:15:57,870
Who punched him?!

3255
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:00,010
Who the fuck!

3256
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:00,890
Oh shit!

3257
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,320
Oh god!

3258
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:07,940
Oh god!

3259
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:09,360
Oh god!

3260
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:10,140
That's not fair!

3261
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:11,020
You had the Doom!

3262
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:14,340
Okay, they used Reaper ult, they used Doom ult.

3263
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:15,440
So that's good.

3264
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:16,460
That means...

3265
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:17,680
Did they Kiriko ult?

3266
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,900
I think they Kiriko ulted.

3267
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:19,900
So...

3268
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:21,660
The only thing they are missing is Nano.

3269
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,700
Oh my god, everybody!

3270
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,520
Everybody always come after me!

3271
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:29,880
Why not the Mora?

3272
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:32,020
The Mora has less...

3273
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:36,000
The Mora has less movement than me!

3274
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:39,060
She looks so juicy and vulnerable!

3275
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:39,360
Oh my god!

3276
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:39,600
Oh my god!

3277
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,540
Hahaha!

3278
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:46,560
Oh god!

3279
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:47,720
There we go!

3280
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:49,140
Please.

3281
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:50,220
It's him!

3282
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,540
It's him!

3283
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:52,880
Hahaha!

3284
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:56,300
Guys, it's him!

3285
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:59,700
I'm going to point, guys.

3286
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:01,080
Hello.

3287
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:02,760
Ayano, I see you there!

3288
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:06,720
Ayano!

3289
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:09,180
Yeah, I went...

3290
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:09,340
Oh my god.

3291
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:10,360
He's gonna touch point.

3292
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:11,540
Most likely.

3293
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:13,460
Yeah!

3294
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:14,180
He missed!

3295
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:16,200
The Doom missed!

3296
02:17:16,980 --> 02:17:18,120
Get the Mora!

3297
02:17:19,550 --> 02:17:20,240
Not me!

3298
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:22,480
I literally can't clap my way away!

3299
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:26,000
Mora just has fade!

3300
02:17:27,140 --> 02:17:29,520
I'm literally getting hard targeted.

3301
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:30,460
It's actually crazy.

3302
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:33,220
Every time I show up, the Doom tries to punch me.

3303
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:38,120
Yeah, but the Mora!

3304
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:40,000
The Mora is with me!

3305
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:41,300
She has less movement!

3306
02:17:46,820 --> 02:17:47,340
Please!

3307
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:50,320
Every time I clap, it's to clap away from the Doom!

3308
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:57,100
This Doom... This Doom really wants to kill me.

3309
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:57,880
It's actually crazy.

3310
02:17:59,060 --> 02:18:00,700
Our Tracer is really good.

3311
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:02,580
I will admit that.

3312
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:05,760
Our Tracer has been getting non-stop picks.

3313
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:09,180
He might have the lowest damage, but he's getting the picks.

3314
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:10,280
Or that.

3315
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:11,600
Which makes sense.

3316
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:16,760
Oh, thank god.

3317
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,060
Leave me alone.

3318
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,060
Leave me alone.

3319
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:21,580
Oh, he has Max!

3320
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:24,920
Oh, please!

3321
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,080
I leave!

3322
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,080
I leave!

3323
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:32,240
There's no point!

3324
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:33,360
He's dead!

3325
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:35,000
He's dead!

3326
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:35,360
He's dead, Mora!

3327
02:18:36,380 --> 02:18:37,740
You should have left earlier!

3328
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:39,560
I should have went with Azaria.

3329
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:41,900
I wanted to save... Oh, Orisa.

3330
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:42,500
Alright.

3331
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:42,780
See?

3332
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:43,560
It's going.

3333
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:45,380
The counter swap, but only on our end.

3334
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:49,640
Because the Doom is just better than our counter swap tank.

3335
02:18:50,060 --> 02:18:51,000
clap my way away!

3336
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:52,280
clap my way away!

3337
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:55,940
No, I saw him.

3338
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,600
I saw him get so much fucking ult charge... punch charge.

3339
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,040
clap my way away!

3340
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:03,860
Why?

3341
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:10,620
No, I don't want to die.

3342
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:10,940
Why?

3343
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:12,020
Oh, no.

3344
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:17,720
I hear him.

3345
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,400
Oh, no.

3346
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:23,900
Alright.

3347
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:26,320
Come on!

3348
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:28,140
This is winnable!

3349
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:31,500
This is so winnable!

3350
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:33,180
Oh, no!

3351
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:35,380
Just get on point!

3352
02:19:39,450 --> 02:19:40,710
This is so winnable!

3353
02:19:42,090 --> 02:19:45,250
I swear the guy...

3354
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:46,010
Nooooo!

3355
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:50,210
Guys, I don't think it's winnable anymore.

3356
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:57,350
Guys, I don't know.

3357
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:00,030
I don't know anymore, guys.

3358
02:20:00,030 --> 02:20:00,870
I...

3359
02:20:02,710 --> 02:20:06,250
Guys, I think we're gonna lose this game.

3360
02:20:06,350 --> 02:20:06,770
Guys.

3361
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:08,410
I don't know.

3362
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:12,790
Oh, please don't anti-Arisa.

3363
02:20:12,810 --> 02:20:13,990
Please don't.

3364
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:15,870
I don't have... He has Reaper ult.

3365
02:20:15,970 --> 02:20:16,950
He has Reaper ult.

3366
02:20:17,010 --> 02:20:17,750
I feel it.

3367
02:20:19,770 --> 02:20:20,650
I feel it.

3368
02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:23,530
Oh, guys.

3369
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:26,850
Please live!

3370
02:20:28,170 --> 02:20:28,730
Oh!

3371
02:20:28,730 --> 02:20:29,530
It's okay.

3372
02:20:30,370 --> 02:20:32,310
It is not okay.

3373
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:33,390
It...

3374
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:34,310
It's okay?

3375
02:20:36,910 --> 02:20:39,010
It is not okay right now.

3376
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:40,870
It is...

3377
02:20:41,710 --> 02:20:43,090
It is not okay.

3378
02:20:43,470 --> 02:20:45,290
I don't feel okay, guys.

3379
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:46,290
I don't...

3380
02:20:47,230 --> 02:20:47,790
Please!

3381
02:20:49,470 --> 02:20:51,230
Arisa's doing so much, guys!

3382
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:52,250
Help Arisa!

3383
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:54,310
He's gonna die!

3384
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:54,490
Oh!

3385
02:20:57,670 --> 02:21:00,010
Moro, why didn't you like sit still for so long?

3386
02:21:00,030 --> 02:21:01,230
Help our team!

3387
02:21:02,590 --> 02:21:05,870
Help us!

3388
02:21:08,330 --> 02:21:08,970
Arisa.

3389
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:09,090
Where is he?

3390
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:11,150
Oh my god, we did it!

3391
02:21:11,250 --> 02:21:13,250
For another fight we lived...

3392
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:16,710
We lived along for another fight!

3393
02:21:20,230 --> 02:21:21,130
Oh, please.

3394
02:21:23,430 --> 02:21:24,070
Oh, please.

3395
02:21:24,070 --> 02:21:24,230
Please.

3396
02:21:24,310 --> 02:21:25,070
Oh, god.

3397
02:21:25,290 --> 02:21:25,930
Please.

3398
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:27,150
Please.

3399
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:28,790
Please.

3400
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:28,910
Please.

3401
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:30,550
Please.

3402
02:21:32,630 --> 02:21:34,390
Oh, god.

3403
02:21:34,470 --> 02:21:34,790
Please.

3404
02:21:34,890 --> 02:21:38,350
I need a... I have to solo contest.

3405
02:21:38,930 --> 02:21:40,170
Oh, my god.

3406
02:21:40,210 --> 02:21:40,510
Please.

3407
02:21:42,670 --> 02:21:44,310
That's so scary.

3408
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:52,150
I don't want a solo contest.

3409
02:21:58,580 --> 02:21:59,260
Oh, god.

3410
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:00,760
Please.

3411
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:03,220
I don't want a solo contest.

3412
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:04,120
I beg you.

3413
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:07,060
I...

3414
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:11,350
God, they got the point though.

3415
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:15,010
They got the point.

3416
02:22:15,330 --> 02:22:15,450
They got the point.

3417
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:15,510
They got the point.

3418
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:20,800
Oh, my.

3419
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,840
The amount of solo contesting I had to do there.

3420
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:26,140
Go, go, go, go!

3421
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:28,480
Go, go, go!

3422
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:29,160
Go, go, go!

3423
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:30,900
Go, go!

3424
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:33,040
Nice!

3425
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:37,260
Please kill the carry!

3426
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:41,200
Oh, he killed the carry!

3427
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:48,640
The amount of dodging I had to do is critical.

3428
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:50,120
Bro!

3429
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:52,920
Jesus.

3430
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:55,880
Oh, my god.

3431
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:57,560
It's so...

3432
02:22:57,560 --> 02:23:00,120
I had to jump around so much.

3433
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:02,020
Oh, my god.

3434
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:05,100
I can't believe I lived that long on point.

3435
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:06,660
Oh, my god.

3436
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:08,440
This Doom deserved the win.

3437
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:10,580
We did not deserve...

3438
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:12,520
This Doom literally was hard carrying.

3439
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:15,860
Holy shit.

3440
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:16,360
Holy shit.

3441
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,220
That was so scary.

3442
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:20,140
That Doom must be so mad.

3443
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,960
He literally carried his entire team on his backs.

3444
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:24,840
We did not deserve that win.

3445
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:25,940
That Doom did...

3446
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:29,400
That Doom did so much.

3447
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:30,740
Oh, my god.

3448
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:35,000
Oh, my god.

3449
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:36,120
Oh, my god.

3450
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:37,040
Oh, this must be so frustrating.

3451
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:37,700
I feel so bad.

3452
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:39,340
I feel so bad for that Doom.

3453
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:41,080
He actually did so much for his team.

3454
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:46,000
I was climbing walls.

3455
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:47,780
I was dodging.

3456
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:48,620
I was weaving.

3457
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:50,020
I was suzuing.

3458
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:52,980
He made me...

3459
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:54,400
He made me fucking...

3460
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:55,620
I was everywhere.

3461
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:56,660
I was...

3462
02:23:56,660 --> 02:24:01,500
I was fucking everywhere because of him.

3463
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:03,800
Jesus.

3464
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:06,820
That was actually so...

3465
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:08,220
Oh, wait.

3466
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:11,140
No.

3467
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:11,460
No!

3468
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:12,740
Oh.

3469
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:17,120
That was so difficult to play.

3470
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:19,940
Oh, my god.

3471
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:21,720
Another one?

3472
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:24,240
That's fucking right.

3473
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:25,020
Okay.

3474
02:24:25,300 --> 02:24:26,100
I deserved that.

3475
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:27,480
This way.

3476
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:27,840
Yeah.

3477
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,200
I actually have to try so hard there.

3478
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,980
I actually have to...

3479
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:32,700
think.

3480
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:39,000
You can tell the difference when it starts getting higher elo games.

3481
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:43,360
My fucking decision making and movement.

3482
02:24:44,540 --> 02:24:46,520
You can tell when I start thinking.

3483
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:49,240
And actually play the game compared to before.

3484
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:53,560
There you go.

3485
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:54,680
Get over here.

3486
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:58,120
I should be playing Ana to practice Leap.

3487
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:58,380
Yeah.

3488
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:00,060
I can think.

3489
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:01,220
I know.

3490
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:03,200
Thank you.

3491
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:07,040
That's not fair.

3492
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:09,960
That's fucking right.

3493
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:11,560
You got a free medkit.

3494
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:13,740
I still beat your ass.

3495
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:20,390
No!

3496
02:25:20,750 --> 02:25:21,250
No!

3497
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:24,350
The last brain cells.

3498
02:25:25,570 --> 02:25:28,670
My last brain cell fucking working on overtime there.

3499
02:25:29,230 --> 02:25:30,130
What the fuck?

3500
02:25:30,210 --> 02:25:30,590
That's right.

3501
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:31,490
Oh, shit.

3502
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:32,930
Thank you.

3503
02:25:33,790 --> 02:25:34,490
Thank you.

3504
02:25:36,090 --> 02:25:37,510
I really appreciate that.

3505
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:39,990
Thanks, Ana.

3506
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:43,390
I hear the Ana.

3507
02:25:43,950 --> 02:25:45,010
Oh, never mind.

3508
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:45,730
She's dead.

3509
02:25:46,990 --> 02:25:47,550
Oh.

3510
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:49,230
Dirty brain expansion.

3511
02:25:49,770 --> 02:25:51,430
But you can tell I'm playing Overwatch more regularly.

3512
02:25:51,450 --> 02:25:53,290
Because I'm actually...

3513
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:54,570
Oh, shit!

3514
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:55,270
You deserve it!

3515
02:25:55,650 --> 02:25:57,310
You fucking deserve that!

3516
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:58,310
Fucking...

3517
02:25:59,280 --> 02:25:59,610
Don't!

3518
02:26:00,210 --> 02:26:01,470
You deserve that!

3519
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:06,110
Versus whenever I play it after like...

3520
02:26:06,110 --> 02:26:08,250
a month...

3521
02:26:08,250 --> 02:26:11,070
Not the Maga.

3522
02:26:11,630 --> 02:26:12,530
Maga, get away.

3523
02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:14,810
Get away.

3524
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:15,710
Get away.

3525
02:26:15,930 --> 02:26:18,930
I will fucking run away.

3526
02:26:19,230 --> 02:26:20,090
Run away.

3527
02:26:21,450 --> 02:26:22,230
Run away from the Maga.

3528
02:26:22,330 --> 02:26:22,930
Run away.

3529
02:26:28,570 --> 02:26:29,670
Where did I go?

3530
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:31,310
I want to...

3531
02:26:31,310 --> 02:26:32,230
Where did I go?

3532
02:26:32,910 --> 02:26:35,650
Where did I...

3533
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:37,270
Yeah, that's right.

3534
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:43,580
Oh my god, the Ana beat him.

3535
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:47,400
Oh my god.

3536
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:49,000
I had to run away.

3537
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:49,880
I was so scared.

3538
02:26:50,060 --> 02:26:51,320
I was so scared.

3539
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:53,500
Oh, connecting.

3540
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:55,480
Come on, give me a game.

3541
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,200
Give me a game already.

3542
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:01,080
That slippery Cassidy.

3543
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:04,140
That's me.

3544
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:04,900
That's me.

3545
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:06,360
I see tank, I run.

3546
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:08,160
That's how it goes.

3547
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:11,560
Somebody's not...

3548
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:12,880
This lobby is bugged.

3549
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:13,580
Are you serious?

3550
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:15,260
Oh, okay.

3551
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:16,320
Nevermind.

3552
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:18,200
That was a bugged lobby.

3553
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:21,020
Prepare your defenses.

3554
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:23,400
Select your hero.

3555
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:29,480
Alright.

3556
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:29,820
Alright.

3557
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:32,120
Uhhh...

3558
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:34,320
I play Ana.

3559
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:36,300
Oh fuck.

3560
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:37,120
We have Rein.

3561
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:40,000
I still play Ana.

3562
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:44,540
The awful Symmetra on the enemy.

3563
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:45,140
Oh, it is!

3564
02:27:45,580 --> 02:27:46,480
It's giraffe boy!

3565
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:49,240
I still play Ana.

3566
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:52,320
Alright, let's go.

3567
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:55,340
People don't really talk anymore in Overwatch.

3568
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:56,500
They just play.

3569
02:27:57,620 --> 02:27:59,460
Guys, you wanna see my sprays?

3570
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:01,360
You wanna see my...

3571
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:03,980
animated sprays?

3572
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:05,260
I'm a legacy.

3573
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,020
Look at that.

3574
02:28:07,460 --> 02:28:08,220
It's moving.

3575
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:10,580
And then I have this one.

3576
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:12,240
And then... Wow!

3577
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:13,680
It's moving!

3578
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:16,240
And then I have this one.

3579
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:18,800
And I have this one.

3580
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:20,940
And then it only lets you show four.

3581
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:21,700
I'm not gonna show four.

3582
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:23,420
I'm an OG.

3583
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:24,960
It moves!

3584
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:25,300
Yeah!

3585
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:26,340
It moves!

3586
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:30,800
Are you printing again?

3587
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:37,840
Are you printing

3588
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:41,320
again?

3589
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:41,400
Oh.

3590
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:42,100
Oh.

3591
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:42,660
Balconies?

3592
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,120
What do you mean you didn't shoot the balcony?

3593
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:48,820
What do you mean you didn't shoot the balcony?

3594
02:28:48,820 --> 02:28:51,840
You're supposed to shoot the balcony so I know...

3595
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,040
So I can shoot through it!

3596
02:28:54,260 --> 02:28:55,980
It's the law of the land!

3597
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:58,200
It's Hollywood!

3598
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:00,100
Oh my god!

3599
02:29:00,930 --> 02:29:02,860
No, he ate my...

3600
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:04,300
He's eating my...

3601
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:06,980
He was eating my fucking...

3602
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:08,000
Heals and everything.

3603
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:11,540
We can't counter the high ground.

3604
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:14,900
We're trying!

3605
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:19,380
They're behind us!

3606
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:22,440
Oh god.

3607
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:26,320
Oh god.

3608
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:28,240
Oh, we lost Cassie.

3609
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:29,720
Cassie, why didn't you go up?

3610
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:34,300
Oh, he ate my... Oh my god.

3611
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:35,980
I slept!

3612
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:42,540
Oh, thank god!

3613
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:44,080
Thank god!

3614
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:45,080
I don't know what...

3615
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:57,280
Oh god, please!

3616
02:29:57,460 --> 02:29:58,880
Please come over to the rally!

3617
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:03,580
What's going on?

3618
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:08,940
Oh, I needed the rally near me!

3619
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:10,520
I wanted to...

3620
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:11,480
No, right!

3621
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:15,800
I needed the rally on me!

3622
02:30:16,860 --> 02:30:19,220
I needed the rally on me!

3623
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,120
Oh no!

3624
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:23,920
Oh, thank god.

3625
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:24,700
At least we have D.Va.

3626
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:25,800
That was hell.

3627
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:27,680
I'm not playing fucking...

3628
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,640
Okay.

3629
02:30:30,580 --> 02:30:31,740
Okay, so you go in.

3630
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:32,100
Now!

3631
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:34,500
Live!

3632
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:36,560
Oh, this is not where I live.

3633
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:44,580
This is where I die!

3634
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:46,820
This is where I die!

3635
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,520
This is where I die!

3636
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:48,840
I'm not playing Ana!

3637
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,080
Oh my god!

3638
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:53,380
That is not an Ana match!

3639
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:58,420
Holy shit!

3640
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:00,860
He fucking ate everything!

3641
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:05,700
There was no way I could play Ana there.

3642
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:07,780
That guy fucking ate all my shit.

3643
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:09,960
Thank you, brother.

3644
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:13,380
I just don't think we should have Kiriko!

3645
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:14,200
I don't know!

3646
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,400
I think we definitely maybe needed something that's not Kiriko.

3647
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,320
I'm not Kiriko.

3648
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:21,220
I'm Brigitte.

3649
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:21,700
Brigitte.

3650
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:22,580
Sorry.

3651
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,020
I was talking about Brigitte.

3652
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:24,860
I'm not talking about me.

3653
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:25,960
Oh!

3654
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:28,740
Leave me alone!

3655
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:31,200
Leave me alone!

3656
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:35,020
Please!

3657
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:36,580
Leave me alone!

3658
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:37,760
He has evil eyes!

3659
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:38,000
I'm gonna bomb!

3660
02:31:40,860 --> 02:31:41,760
Oh, thank god!

3661
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:43,300
Oh, thank god I lived!

3662
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:44,700
I was not sure.

3663
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:47,280
I was not sure if I was gonna live that.

3664
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:50,680
Nice.

3665
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:52,800
We're doing great.

3666
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:54,820
I'm gonna stay on the ground.

3667
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:57,160
I know I shouldn't be, but like...

3668
02:31:57,160 --> 02:31:58,360
I'm gonna stay on.

3669
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:01,760
Alright.

3670
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:02,280
Live!

3671
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:04,360
I don't have cleanse, but live!

3672
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:06,500
Eternate if you can!

3673
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:12,400
I need you to Eternate!

3674
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:13,940
Oh my god!

3675
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:15,120
How are you so low?

3676
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:18,200
I have cleanse.

3677
02:32:18,340 --> 02:32:18,620
I have cleanse.

3678
02:32:20,660 --> 02:32:22,820
That's fucking right, but you didn't get cleanse!

3679
02:32:28,310 --> 02:32:29,690
Oh, he's so low though.

3680
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:30,770
That's unfair.

3681
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:32,410
This is actually a sim map for him.

3682
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:34,330
I think he's a sim one trick.

3683
02:32:35,350 --> 02:32:36,330
I just noticed.

3684
02:32:36,490 --> 02:32:38,310
I think that would make sense actually.

3685
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:41,790
Oh god.

3686
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:42,650
Nice.

3687
02:32:43,510 --> 02:32:45,050
That's very unlucky for you.

3688
02:32:45,230 --> 02:32:46,710
But we have...

3689
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:48,990
I think we have...

3690
02:32:49,770 --> 02:32:50,350
What?

3691
02:32:50,490 --> 02:32:51,810
He got fucking cleanse?

3692
02:32:56,050 --> 02:32:56,630
Please.

3693
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:57,450
Please live.

3694
02:32:58,130 --> 02:32:58,990
Please live.

3695
02:32:59,250 --> 02:32:59,830
Please.

3696
02:33:00,710 --> 02:33:01,710
I can't!

3697
02:33:01,830 --> 02:33:03,930
There's too many things going on!

3698
02:33:06,490 --> 02:33:07,070
Maybe...

3699
02:33:07,070 --> 02:33:09,470
I was gonna say Pharah for the Symmetra.

3700
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:11,910
Because they don't really have any DPS.

3701
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:14,490
Alright, I'm gonna stay here.

3702
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:17,970
I'm gonna stay here so I can swap.

3703
02:33:18,090 --> 02:33:18,430
There we go.

3704
02:33:19,170 --> 02:33:20,930
I have to go Curacle for the cleanse.

3705
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:23,490
We need to break the swap off.

3706
02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:25,630
Yeah.

3707
02:33:27,810 --> 02:33:28,710
Give me Zarya?

3708
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:29,850
Give me Zarya?

3709
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:31,910
Zarya would be good on this counter.

3710
02:33:32,690 --> 02:33:33,750
For the counter swap.

3711
02:33:35,710 --> 02:33:37,250
This is a good D.Va player too.

3712
02:33:39,730 --> 02:33:41,250
I literally saved your life.

3713
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:43,570
I predicted you to go that way.

3714
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:45,250
Get predicted.

3715
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:47,230
Oh.

3716
02:33:47,330 --> 02:33:48,870
There's a Cassidy behind us.

3717
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:50,110
This is bad.

3718
02:33:50,350 --> 02:33:51,550
No, I don't have cleanse.

3719
02:33:51,790 --> 02:33:52,510
I don't have cleanse.

3720
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:53,830
Please stay alive for...

3721
02:33:53,830 --> 02:33:55,150
a little longer.

3722
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:56,230
Please.

3723
02:33:56,910 --> 02:33:57,970
Please stay alive.

3724
02:33:58,370 --> 02:33:59,310
I'm sorry!

3725
02:33:59,550 --> 02:34:01,110
Our Frigg is not with us!

3726
02:34:06,090 --> 02:34:08,970
I tried so hard to keep you alive!

3727
02:34:09,530 --> 02:34:10,510
Guys, I...

3728
02:34:10,510 --> 02:34:12,310
I think...

3729
02:34:12,310 --> 02:34:13,390
I...

3730
02:34:14,430 --> 02:34:15,590
I think we have a Frigg one trick.

3731
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:18,730
No, I didn't use my cleanse!

3732
02:34:19,670 --> 02:34:21,130
Let me judge you.

3733
02:34:21,630 --> 02:34:24,730
Let me judge you.

3734
02:34:25,930 --> 02:34:27,570
You don't even...

3735
02:34:27,570 --> 02:34:27,950
Okay.

3736
02:34:28,310 --> 02:34:31,830
I wonder what the issue is.

3737
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:33,310
I don't know, Frigg!

3738
02:34:35,630 --> 02:34:37,450
We don't need Frigg!

3739
02:34:38,970 --> 02:34:41,450
We don't even need Frigg!

3740
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:44,230
Yo, you don't play Frigg!

3741
02:34:45,330 --> 02:34:46,210
What the...

3742
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:47,950
What is your account?!

3743
02:34:49,030 --> 02:34:51,370
What is your fucking account?!

3744
02:34:51,370 --> 02:34:53,350
You don't even play Frigg!

3745
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:58,220
You don't even play Frigg!

3746
02:34:58,220 --> 02:34:59,400
You don't have hours on Frigg!

3747
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:02,460
Oh, okay, nine hours.

3748
02:35:02,660 --> 02:35:05,480
He's your least played support!

3749
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:11,980
He's literally your least played support!

3750
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:17,600
Don't understand!

3751
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:23,260
Play... play...

3752
02:35:24,060 --> 02:35:26,320
This is a vertical map!

3753
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:30,420
The reason why I don't think Brig works here is because this map is vertical.

3754
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:33,500
Like, this is a vertical map.

3755
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,700
You're not gonna be useful.

3756
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:38,680
As Brig with verticality.

3757
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:42,040
Let him have fun!

3758
02:35:42,260 --> 02:35:43,000
He can't!

3759
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,280
This game is now free to play!

3760
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:45,900
He spent zero dollars!

3761
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:49,480
Except for that Brig skin, maybe.

3762
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:51,880
Maybe the Brig skin he spent money on.

3763
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:52,680
But like...

3764
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:57,940
They can use the skin where like, I spent $40 to play whatever I want.

3765
02:35:58,140 --> 02:35:59,560
Oh, now you play Lari!

3766
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:00,280
Okay.

3767
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,740
He wants to play fun.

3768
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:05,420
Yeah, play in the ring.

3769
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:07,540
He is smart.

3770
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:08,720
Bro!

3771
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:13,880
I avoided this fucking Symmetra and now this Symmetra is gonna farm me!

3772
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:15,980
This is not fair.

3773
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,200
This is not fair.

3774
02:36:19,060 --> 02:36:23,400
My avoid slots is to be used to gain SR, not fucking lose.

3775
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:24,400
Okay.

3776
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:25,360
Alright.

3777
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:28,220
Don't peek, guys.

3778
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:30,080
Don't peek.

3779
02:36:31,020 --> 02:36:32,620
Don't peek.

3780
02:36:33,740 --> 02:36:34,540
Jesus.

3781
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:36,180
I wish I was Juno right now.

3782
02:36:37,100 --> 02:36:37,980
Oh my god!

3783
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:38,600
He's so low!

3784
02:36:38,660 --> 02:36:39,520
I have to heal though!

3785
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:41,120
That sucks!

3786
02:36:43,560 --> 02:36:45,400
This is a really good D.Va player though.

3787
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:46,240
I have to admit.

3788
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:48,540
The D.Va player is really good.

3789
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:52,720
Oh my god.

3790
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:53,400
I almost have ult.

3791
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:55,380
Oh no!

3792
02:36:56,020 --> 02:36:57,920
We're trying so hard to keep you alive!

3793
02:36:59,300 --> 02:37:00,660
We're trying so hard!

3794
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:04,380
I'm almost close to ult.

3795
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:07,720
Can we play Pharah?

3796
02:37:07,880 --> 02:37:08,840
Can somebody play Pharah?

3797
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:12,600
I think if we had Pharah it would work.

3798
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:14,280
That's just me!

3799
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:16,160
That's just...

3800
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:24,020
The only issue would be D.Va but if you have a pocket Mercy you'll be fine!

3801
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:28,320
Or Zarya.

3802
02:37:28,520 --> 02:37:29,880
Wait, why are we playing Zarya though?

3803
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:30,640
I don't know.

3804
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:31,920
Maybe Zarya would be good.

3805
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:34,620
Oh my god.

3806
02:37:37,820 --> 02:37:39,600
Bro, that D.Va died literally once.

3807
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:42,360
Bro, Sigma please.

3808
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,300
Do not let the D.Va get mech back.

3809
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:45,220
Please!

3810
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:47,160
That's all I want!

3811
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:50,260
There you go!

3812
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:50,660
Go!

3813
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:52,100
Go go go go!

3814
02:37:55,160 --> 02:37:55,640
Alright.

3815
02:37:55,640 --> 02:37:56,340
I'm dead.

3816
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:56,860
I guess.

3817
02:37:57,680 --> 02:37:58,340
I guess.

3818
02:37:58,840 --> 02:37:59,660
I guess.

3819
02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:01,440
They used 4 ults.

3820
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:04,680
I don't know.

3821
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:07,000
This team is...

3822
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:07,620
Yeah.

3823
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:09,820
I don't know.

3824
02:38:11,960 --> 02:38:13,340
I don't know, man.

3825
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:15,740
Can we...

3826
02:38:15,740 --> 02:38:18,060
Can we get Zarya in?

3827
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:21,340
Where the fuck is our Zarya?

3828
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:23,780
Wait, did we use Elarion?

3829
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:27,160
I don't know.

3830
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:27,260
I don't know.

3831
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:30,460
Maybe... Maybe Zarya would be a good idea.

3832
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:30,920
Guys!

3833
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:33,340
What the fuck?

3834
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:35,920
Oh my god.

3835
02:38:35,960 --> 02:38:36,500
Did we do it?

3836
02:38:38,940 --> 02:38:39,700
Guys, it's okay.

3837
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:40,740
I got the turret, guys.

3838
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:41,940
It's okay.

3839
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:43,400
It's okay.

3840
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:43,860
You're...

3841
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:44,840
You're...

3842
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:48,280
Oh my god.

3843
02:38:48,540 --> 02:38:49,520
I thought he was closer.

3844
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:54,880
I actually thought he was closer.

3845
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:56,000
Oh!

3846
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,240
This is where I die.

3847
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:57,920
Goodbye.

3848
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:00,100
Thank God.

3849
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:02,640
I don't know who to avoid.

3850
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:04,060
My entire team...

3851
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:07,140
My entire team is a mess.

3852
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,800
Who the fuck do I avoid?

3853
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:09,700
Interesting.

3854
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:12,080
I...

3855
02:39:12,820 --> 02:39:14,900
You play every tank but Zarya!

3856
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:16,640
How is that possible?

3857
02:39:19,130 --> 02:39:20,310
It's just tricky!

3858
02:39:20,650 --> 02:39:22,670
Zarya is one of the easiest tanks to play.

3859
02:39:22,830 --> 02:39:24,470
Non-tank players play Zarya.

3860
02:39:24,670 --> 02:39:27,690
Because she's literally the easiest tank to play.

3861
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:31,650
It's all about tracking and bubble management.

3862
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:33,130
Can you not track?

3863
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:35,830
It's just aim!

3864
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:43,250
People who don't know how to play tank, they play Zarya!

3865
02:39:47,630 --> 02:39:51,810
How have you played 30 plus seasons of Overwatch?

3866
02:39:52,910 --> 02:39:54,170
Just a struggle!

3867
02:39:58,820 --> 02:40:00,220
Oh my god!

3868
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:02,580
Tracking is hard!

3869
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:04,660
We're in Master Elo!

3870
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:06,040
How?!

3871
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:09,340
You should not not know how to track by Master Elo time!

3872
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:13,840
No, fuck this guy.

3873
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:15,940
Okay, I think I'm just gonna void the tank.

3874
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:18,260
I'm gonna void the tank!

3875
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:22,540
Alright, you know what?

3876
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:24,740
I'll get that Zarya player back.

3877
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:26,180
Um...

3878
02:40:26,180 --> 02:40:26,480
Um...

3879
02:40:27,580 --> 02:40:29,860
Just cause he can't play anything...

3880
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:31,480
He can't play Zarya.

3881
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:32,360
I don't understand.

3882
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:34,720
Literally, you go Zarya, attack!

3883
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:38,100
The only verticality is that one place.

3884
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:39,600
He went Rein!

3885
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:43,240
This has to be... Oh my god, it has to be one of those tank players that can't aim!

3886
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,260
He literally went like Rein and Winston!

3887
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:50,140
I mean, Sigma requires... He went every tank in the world!

3888
02:40:50,660 --> 02:40:51,640
But Zarya!

3889
02:40:58,140 --> 02:41:01,100
Like... How do you play every tank?!

3890
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:01,680
We have!

3891
02:41:02,340 --> 02:41:03,520
But Zarya!

3892
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:06,200
He played D.Va!

3893
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:10,620
Sorry, I...

3894
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:15,720
I can't use the bath, it'll be right back.

3895
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:19,600
I'm back to suffer once again.

3896
02:42:20,300 --> 02:42:22,200
It's just... It's just tanks!

3897
02:42:23,620 --> 02:42:24,480
I... I...

3898
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:27,100
I lose because of shit tanks!

3899
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:27,800
Like...

3900
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:31,420
Alan, Kaz, Duck, Miki, Medi, and Neppers!

3901
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:32,340
Thank you for the super chat!

3902
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:33,060
Thank you!

3903
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:36,040
I didn't lose because of garbage tanks!

3904
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:36,820
And that's it!

3905
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:39,420
If I have a good tank...

3906
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:42,180
I would... I can like... I can like just keep him up!

3907
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:43,000
And then we win!

3908
02:42:47,380 --> 02:42:49,340
Sorry, I couldn't pee the toxicity out.

3909
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:49,880
I tried.

3910
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:53,200
I tried so hard.

3911
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:54,720
I tried so hard.

3912
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:57,080
I tried so hard.

3913
02:42:57,100 --> 02:42:57,260
I'm so...

3914
02:42:58,220 --> 02:42:59,160
That's fucked up.

3915
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:00,240
That's fucked up, Gengu.

3916
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:01,440
I'm nearly 11 HP.

3917
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:06,160
Oh shit!

3918
02:43:09,820 --> 02:43:11,800
I can always blame tanks.

3919
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:13,540
You lose because of bad tanks.

3920
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:14,280
It's nothing else.

3921
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:16,460
A good tank can actually 1v4.

3922
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:17,760
We saw that.

3923
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:19,320
We saw our Hog 1v4.

3924
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:21,920
It's true.

3925
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:25,080
We literally saw it in our game.

3926
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:30,080
Then play tanks.

3927
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:31,540
Surely you can do... I'm not a tank main!

3928
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:36,520
That's the thing!

3929
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:37,700
I'm not a tank main!

3930
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:39,080
But they are!

3931
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:40,280
Wait, did I get killed?

3932
02:43:40,380 --> 02:43:40,740
Am I red?

3933
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:42,020
No, I'm Shimada.

3934
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:44,700
Oh shit!

3935
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:46,340
That's an actual Widow player.

3936
02:43:48,220 --> 02:43:48,900
I'm scared.

3937
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:51,320
This is an actual Widow player.

3938
02:43:57,290 --> 02:43:58,770
Did you see what I...

3939
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:05,760
I just waited for him to go across my crosshair.

3940
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:07,220
Because I know he was fucking around.

3941
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:12,080
Don't aim.

3942
02:44:12,180 --> 02:44:14,000
I just waited for him to go...

3943
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:17,540
I waited for him to fucking strafe into my crosshair.

3944
02:44:18,020 --> 02:44:19,120
That's all you have to do.

3945
02:44:20,120 --> 02:44:23,640
If they fucking do that shitty strafe shit...

3946
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:27,200
Yeah, I just let him walk into my dot.

3947
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:35,540
Okay.

3948
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:39,520
I'm gonna go to the other side.

3949
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:39,520
No!

3950
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:40,640
What?!

3951
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:42,220
Who are you?!

3952
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:46,160
You're not part of this Widow fight!

3953
02:44:53,100 --> 02:44:54,700
Are you serious?

3954
02:45:03,560 --> 02:45:05,100
Come on, Cassidy.

3955
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:07,420
Come on.

3956
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:10,500
Oh, he's over there now.

3957
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:11,200
Okay.

3958
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:13,080
Oh, they're all so far.

3959
02:45:17,310 --> 02:45:18,430
There's a Lucio?!

3960
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:22,430
Is this Sombra?!

3961
02:45:28,630 --> 02:45:29,550
Oh no.

3962
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:37,100
Is he gonna recall?

3963
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:41,440
Oh my god, he recalled there?!

3964
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:44,080
I was not expecting him to recall there.

3965
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:51,260
Okay.

3966
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:53,540
Fucking nerds.

3967
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:58,120
Alright, where are they?

3968
02:46:02,420 --> 02:46:03,660
Oh, are they like chilling?

3969
02:46:12,550 --> 02:46:13,390
Where are they?

3970
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:15,610
I wanna chill.

3971
02:46:15,690 --> 02:46:16,190
Wait, what?

3972
02:46:16,470 --> 02:46:17,530
I wanna chill.

3973
02:46:18,770 --> 02:46:20,330
I wanna chill up there.

3974
02:46:20,530 --> 02:46:23,050
No fighting on this friendship rock.

3975
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:25,610
Oh man, I wish I was Ilari.

3976
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:29,810
Oh man, I wish I was Ilari.

3977
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:31,030
He's not in the friendship rock.

3978
02:46:33,090 --> 02:46:34,610
You're not in the friendship rock.

3979
02:46:34,610 --> 02:46:36,170
He's not in the friendship rock!

3980
02:46:38,310 --> 02:46:40,570
You said only friendship rock.

3981
02:46:40,970 --> 02:46:42,110
This is peaceful.

3982
02:46:43,510 --> 02:46:46,610
He didn't say I can't shoot on the friendship rock.

3983
02:46:46,730 --> 02:46:48,850
He just said I can't kill people on this one.

3984
02:46:50,290 --> 02:46:51,410
Those are fair game.

3985
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:53,230
They're all not on the friendship rock.

3986
02:46:55,910 --> 02:46:56,690
Where are they?

3987
02:46:57,110 --> 02:46:57,770
Over there.

3988
02:46:58,090 --> 02:46:59,130
Is that all of them?

3989
02:47:00,990 --> 02:47:01,890
That's all of them.

3990
02:47:01,990 --> 02:47:02,230
Okay.

3991
02:47:02,770 --> 02:47:03,490
Oh shit.

3992
02:47:06,610 --> 02:47:07,490
Come on.

3993
02:47:07,570 --> 02:47:08,170
Pick me.

3994
02:47:08,710 --> 02:47:09,410
Come on!

3995
02:47:09,910 --> 02:47:10,390
No!

3996
02:47:12,950 --> 02:47:14,250
I was gonna shoot him.

3997
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:17,270
What?

3998
02:47:17,550 --> 02:47:18,770
Why did you pull me off?

3999
02:47:18,990 --> 02:47:20,110
He wasn't on it!

4000
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:27,440
No.

4001
02:47:27,580 --> 02:47:29,040
I wanted friendship rock.

4002
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:32,160
Diamond 1 to Master 5.

4003
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:33,860
Let's see.

4004
02:47:34,280 --> 02:47:35,300
I don't know when to stop.

4005
02:47:36,340 --> 02:47:37,440
I'm having a good time.

4006
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:38,120
Not gonna lie.

4007
02:47:40,740 --> 02:47:41,860
Uh... Mercy...

4008
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:43,280
Should I play Lari?

4009
02:47:44,680 --> 02:47:45,420
One game.

4010
02:47:45,940 --> 02:47:47,200
God, I wish it was attack.

4011
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:49,500
I'm not good at Lari.

4012
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:51,240
But if I'm... Okay.

4013
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:52,060
I'll do one life.

4014
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:57,940
I'm not very good at Lari.

4015
02:47:58,100 --> 02:47:59,140
Because I don't play her often.

4016
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:04,500
I love how... I like the melee on this.

4017
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:04,860
Boom.

4018
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:05,820
Boom.

4019
02:48:06,180 --> 02:48:07,560
I'm glad that...

4020
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:10,040
Overwatch is doing fun skins now.

4021
02:48:10,900 --> 02:48:12,080
Even though I would never spend money.

4022
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:16,900
I don't care as much.

4023
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:19,900
The range on these pylons are insane.

4024
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:23,000
Who is your main in each category?

4025
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:25,140
I play every support but...

4026
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:25,640
Okay, not every.

4027
02:48:26,740 --> 02:48:28,640
It's easy to say what supports I don't play.

4028
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,340
I don't play...

4029
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:31,220
Lari.

4030
02:48:31,440 --> 02:48:32,420
But I'm gonna see if I can.

4031
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:33,920
Because apparently Lari is meta now.

4032
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:36,280
I don't play Lari...

4033
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:39,020
Bap...

4034
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:41,060
Life Weaver.

4035
02:48:41,460 --> 02:48:43,160
I think those are the only supports I don't play.

4036
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:44,900
I don't know if there's any other.

4037
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:50,300
I just know that pylon is fucking crazy now.

4038
02:48:50,440 --> 02:48:51,180
The range.

4039
02:48:58,090 --> 02:48:59,750
Okay, I just want to make sure I have like...

4040
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:05,060
See there's... the fact that...

4041
02:49:08,140 --> 02:49:09,660
The fact that like...

4042
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:10,380
Oh!

4043
02:49:11,400 --> 02:49:12,280
No, no.

4044
02:49:12,340 --> 02:49:12,980
Not my pylon.

4045
02:49:16,320 --> 02:49:17,460
Not my pylon!

4046
02:49:18,940 --> 02:49:19,480
Alright.

4047
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:20,740
I need to remember that...

4048
02:49:20,740 --> 02:49:22,260
Shift is to bounce apart.

4049
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:23,060
Bounce away.

4050
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:24,300
And put the...

4051
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:25,460
I think I'm gonna put the pylon here.

4052
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:26,780
It's the safest.

4053
02:49:33,650 --> 02:49:35,770
What the fuck are you doing?!

4054
02:49:36,910 --> 02:49:38,310
What the fuck?!

4055
02:49:40,600 --> 02:49:42,600
What the fuck was he doing?!

4056
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:52,400
Did you guys see that?!

4057
02:49:58,290 --> 02:49:59,490
Oh my god.

4058
02:49:59,510 --> 02:49:59,990
I'm fucking dead.

4059
02:50:00,110 --> 02:50:00,550
I'm dead.

4060
02:50:02,930 --> 02:50:03,950
Oh god.

4061
02:50:05,410 --> 02:50:06,970
What the fuck was I...

4062
02:50:06,970 --> 02:50:07,590
What?!

4063
02:50:07,590 --> 02:50:09,130
Was he stuck?!

4064
02:50:09,130 --> 02:50:12,670
What the fuck was our Sigma doing?!

4065
02:50:15,970 --> 02:50:17,050
He was...

4066
02:50:17,050 --> 02:50:17,650
Okay.

4067
02:50:17,790 --> 02:50:19,010
He literally threw that.

4068
02:50:19,130 --> 02:50:21,270
We actually had such a good play there.

4069
02:50:21,450 --> 02:50:23,510
He actually threw that.

4070
02:50:23,630 --> 02:50:25,410
Holy shit!

4071
02:50:25,830 --> 02:50:26,070
Holy shit!

4072
02:50:28,090 --> 02:50:29,790
Oh my god.

4073
02:50:30,010 --> 02:50:30,370
Oh my god.

4074
02:50:30,370 --> 02:50:30,710
I was like...

4075
02:50:30,710 --> 02:50:31,950
What the fuck?!

4076
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:34,750
That was so winnable!

4077
02:50:35,510 --> 02:50:37,550
That was so winnable!

4078
02:50:37,550 --> 02:50:38,210
Let's see.

4079
02:50:38,290 --> 02:50:38,790
I'll put it here.

4080
02:50:42,470 --> 02:50:43,050
Okay.

4081
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:43,810
He's on my pylon.

4082
02:50:44,030 --> 02:50:45,230
So he's too busy looking.

4083
02:50:45,950 --> 02:50:46,910
Oh no.

4084
02:50:47,170 --> 02:50:48,130
Oh no.

4085
02:50:48,210 --> 02:50:48,890
Are you serious?

4086
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:49,290
Okay.

4087
02:50:49,410 --> 02:50:50,450
We got Zarya though.

4088
02:50:50,590 --> 02:50:50,850
Oh.

4089
02:50:57,550 --> 02:50:58,930
I can't do anything about that.

4090
02:51:00,790 --> 02:51:01,950
Best I can do...

4091
02:51:01,950 --> 02:51:03,190
Is like... head up.

4092
02:51:04,110 --> 02:51:04,590
Oh!

4093
02:51:07,650 --> 02:51:09,350
I'm gonna ult and then I'll swap off.

4094
02:51:09,490 --> 02:51:11,310
I don't think like Zarya is working for me.

4095
02:51:11,770 --> 02:51:12,730
For this team.

4096
02:51:13,470 --> 02:51:15,990
I'm not doing enough DPS to justify it.

4097
02:51:20,550 --> 02:51:21,790
I'll do it too.

4098
02:51:21,930 --> 02:51:22,950
I'll do it too.

4099
02:51:24,690 --> 02:51:25,250
What?!

4100
02:51:25,250 --> 02:51:26,410
Holy shit!

4101
02:51:26,810 --> 02:51:28,530
Did that Lari got me?!

4102
02:51:28,530 --> 02:51:29,290
Oh no.

4103
02:51:29,350 --> 02:51:30,230
The Soldier hit me.

4104
02:51:30,530 --> 02:51:31,090
Alright.

4105
02:51:33,730 --> 02:51:34,650
I'll go Ana.

4106
02:51:35,150 --> 02:51:37,310
I don't think they're using cleanse.

4107
02:51:38,270 --> 02:51:38,570
I don't think they're using cleanse.

4108
02:51:38,570 --> 02:51:39,430
They're not using...

4109
02:51:40,530 --> 02:51:41,650
Grenade often.

4110
02:51:46,340 --> 02:51:48,100
I'm not good enough as...

4111
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:48,260
I'm not good enough as...

4112
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:50,420
The Lari.

4113
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:51,140
The player.

4114
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:54,580
Oh god.

4115
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:55,360
Oh god.

4116
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,300
I know my limits.

4117
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:02,220
I know my limits when it came to Lari!

4118
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:04,240
Oh I should go...

4119
02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:04,680
Kuroko.

4120
02:52:05,180 --> 02:52:08,420
I just realized I should go Kuroko because of the Zarya ult.

4121
02:52:12,470 --> 02:52:13,310
Oh no!

4122
02:52:14,010 --> 02:52:16,230
I need to die so I can go Kuroko!

4123
02:52:21,820 --> 02:52:22,960
Come on Winston!

4124
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:23,860
You got this!

4125
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:26,580
Oh he booped everybody away.

4126
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:27,400
But that's okay.

4127
02:52:27,900 --> 02:52:28,580
That's okay.

4128
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,920
He's gonna farm all the...

4129
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:32,840
Oh he already has ult.

4130
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:34,480
Oh that is not okay.

4131
02:52:34,720 --> 02:52:35,640
That is not okay.

4132
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:36,500
No more.

4133
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:37,380
We heal each other.

4134
02:52:37,500 --> 02:52:38,680
We heal each other!

4135
02:52:40,260 --> 02:52:40,940
That's right!

4136
02:52:41,100 --> 02:52:42,220
That ult was useless!

4137
02:52:42,980 --> 02:52:44,280
We keep each other alive!

4138
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:48,080
I need to learn Lari.

4139
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:49,220
Holy shit.

4140
02:52:49,280 --> 02:52:50,120
If she's gonna be meta.

4141
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:51,220
I don't...

4142
02:52:52,980 --> 02:52:54,600
I don't need to play Lari.

4143
02:52:54,820 --> 02:52:55,500
Or like...

4144
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:57,140
Learn how to play Lari.

4145
02:52:58,800 --> 02:52:59,920
Or... Jesus!

4146
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:03,540
Or like...

4147
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:05,300
Play with somebody that plays Lari.

4148
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:08,660
Because holy fuck.

4149
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:10,480
I don't know if I can learn Lari in time.

4150
02:53:10,520 --> 02:53:11,040
That's the thing.

4151
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:17,860
Where's the Winston?

4152
02:53:19,540 --> 02:53:20,420
There he is.

4153
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:21,720
Oh!

4154
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:24,800
Alright.

4155
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:26,280
Yeah.

4156
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:28,660
It's more so balancing DPS than heals.

4157
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:29,760
That's like the issue.

4158
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:30,920
When I said he...

4159
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:32,800
Oh he bubbled!

4160
02:53:34,820 --> 02:53:35,640
That's cheating!

4161
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:39,460
He bubbled!

4162
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:40,700
Yeah that's what I'm saying.

4163
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:41,960
I need to like learn Lari.

4164
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:42,800
Um...

4165
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:44,880
Off stream.

4166
02:53:45,260 --> 02:53:46,980
Because like I can't learn her on stream.

4167
02:53:48,520 --> 02:53:49,580
Are you... Okay.

4168
02:53:49,820 --> 02:53:50,340
That...

4169
02:53:50,420 --> 02:53:52,620
He was way too aggressive for no reason.

4170
02:53:55,640 --> 02:53:56,620
Jesus please.

4171
02:54:00,460 --> 02:54:01,020
Okay.

4172
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:03,480
I'm okay.

4173
02:54:03,980 --> 02:54:04,760
I'm okay.

4174
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:05,560
I have nano.

4175
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:07,620
I couldn't swap to...

4176
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:09,200
It's okay.

4177
02:54:13,300 --> 02:54:14,080
It's okay.

4178
02:54:14,180 --> 02:54:14,640
We're fine.

4179
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:18,280
He's low!

4180
02:54:18,440 --> 02:54:19,200
He's so low!

4181
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:20,920
Please!

4182
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:22,480
Please!

4183
02:54:22,480 --> 02:54:22,720
Please!

4184
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
He's so dead.

4185
02:54:25,180 --> 02:54:26,140
I'm so dead.

4186
02:54:28,440 --> 02:54:29,780
Oh we're so dead.

4187
02:54:29,860 --> 02:54:32,120
Mercy I need you to keep me up or I get starstruck.

4188
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:33,780
Whatever that ult is called.

4189
02:54:34,480 --> 02:54:34,880
Okay.

4190
02:54:35,540 --> 02:54:36,660
Alright I'm going back.

4191
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:37,380
I'm going back.

4192
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:38,140
Keep me up!

4193
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:38,780
Keep me up!

4194
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:40,700
I'm gonna go Kiriko for the grab!

4195
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:43,940
No that's a Lari.

4196
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:51,280
He has all... Oh we don't have all...

4197
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:53,520
This is...

4198
02:54:53,540 --> 02:54:53,740
This is bad.

4199
02:54:53,880 --> 02:54:54,380
I used cleanse.

4200
02:54:54,580 --> 02:54:55,720
Guys I used cleanse!

4201
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:56,320
This is bad!

4202
02:54:56,700 --> 02:54:57,760
It's okay he's dead!

4203
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:02,890
Oh he went in so deep there.

4204
02:55:03,990 --> 02:55:04,490
It's okay.

4205
02:55:04,590 --> 02:55:04,870
We're okay.

4206
02:55:04,970 --> 02:55:05,230
We're okay.

4207
02:55:08,670 --> 02:55:09,290
We're fine.

4208
02:55:09,430 --> 02:55:09,730
We're fine.

4209
02:55:09,810 --> 02:55:10,390
Everything's fine.

4210
02:55:14,750 --> 02:55:15,190
Alright.

4211
02:55:16,030 --> 02:55:17,330
Has our Widow done anything?

4212
02:55:19,730 --> 02:55:20,710
Okay he has kills.

4213
02:55:20,890 --> 02:55:21,090
Alright.

4214
02:55:21,090 --> 02:55:22,650
I just gotta be sure!

4215
02:55:22,810 --> 02:55:23,370
I couldn't tell!

4216
02:55:23,850 --> 02:55:25,870
I need my cleanse for...

4217
02:55:25,870 --> 02:55:28,490
I need my cleanse for the...

4218
02:55:28,490 --> 02:55:29,290
Oh!

4219
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:30,270
Okay the Mercy ult!

4220
02:55:30,410 --> 02:55:31,130
Interesting pick.

4221
02:55:31,250 --> 02:55:31,710
Interesting pick.

4222
02:55:33,170 --> 02:55:33,690
Alright.

4223
02:55:35,210 --> 02:55:36,430
This is where we die.

4224
02:55:38,250 --> 02:55:39,850
This is where we die.

4225
02:55:39,850 --> 02:55:40,670
Oh I don't know!

4226
02:55:40,730 --> 02:55:41,230
I don't know guys!

4227
02:55:41,710 --> 02:55:42,530
I don't know!

4228
02:55:44,150 --> 02:55:44,670
Oh!

4229
02:55:47,290 --> 02:55:48,330
Goodbye Winston!

4230
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:50,690
Oh shit!

4231
02:55:51,090 --> 02:55:51,250
Oh!

4232
02:55:51,310 --> 02:55:51,990
Okay we're fine.

4233
02:55:52,090 --> 02:55:52,850
We're so safe.

4234
02:55:52,970 --> 02:55:54,170
We're so safe.

4235
02:55:54,350 --> 02:55:55,210
Can we touch?

4236
02:55:55,750 --> 02:55:57,150
No no I have to go Lucio.

4237
02:56:02,030 --> 02:56:02,710
Get away!

4238
02:56:03,330 --> 02:56:04,850
Oh I did my job!

4239
02:56:05,290 --> 02:56:06,690
I did my job!

4240
02:56:06,750 --> 02:56:07,290
You're welcome!

4241
02:56:09,710 --> 02:56:11,550
I did my job!

4242
02:56:11,870 --> 02:56:13,030
I touched!

4243
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:18,270
Nobody touched but me!

4244
02:56:22,050 --> 02:56:22,750
me!

4245
02:56:22,750 --> 02:56:24,350
Nobody touched but me!

4246
02:56:26,790 --> 02:56:27,490
Oh!

4247
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:29,850
We don't have an Ilari player!

4248
02:56:30,170 --> 02:56:32,010
Cause I don't play Ilari either!

4249
02:56:33,950 --> 02:56:34,990
Feels bad!

4250
02:56:35,450 --> 02:56:37,310
We don't have an Ilari player!

4251
02:56:40,030 --> 02:56:42,550
My Ilari is not at this level!

4252
02:56:45,170 --> 02:56:48,230
My lair is sadly not this level.

4253
02:56:51,610 --> 02:56:52,490
Okay.

4254
02:56:59,400 --> 02:57:01,160
Let's see...

4255
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:01,920
Yes!

4256
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:02,520
Yes!

4257
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:14,660
I don't think Kiriko would be... Oh wait!

4258
02:57:14,780 --> 02:57:17,640
We have Hammond, so...

4259
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:19,920
If we have Hammond, I'll go Kiriko.

4260
02:57:21,860 --> 02:57:23,320
Hammond is not good with Ana.

4261
02:57:24,200 --> 02:57:28,380
Because it's so hard to heal Hammond when he's so fucking... he's everywhere.

4262
02:57:32,820 --> 02:57:35,720
Apparently, they've been talking about hero bans for fucking ever.

4263
02:57:35,980 --> 02:57:36,860
So like, I don't know.

4264
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:37,700
That's the thing.

4265
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:39,520
Hero bans has been like...

4266
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:42,860
They've always talked about hero bans, but they've never actually implemented it.

4267
02:57:42,980 --> 02:57:45,940
They tried in Overwatch League, but then they didn't do anything about it.

4268
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:48,880
So...

4269
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:50,700
Hero bans, it's like League.

4270
02:57:50,800 --> 02:57:51,740
You can ban a hero.

4271
02:57:52,600 --> 02:57:53,040
Basically.

4272
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:56,340
It's just like League.

4273
02:57:57,880 --> 02:57:59,460
So that you just ban a hero.

4274
02:57:59,900 --> 02:58:01,820
And you don't want people to play.

4275
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:04,920
So you ban like... I don't know.

4276
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:08,560
Both teams cannot play like D.Va or something.

4277
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:11,900
But like they always... they've done it before.

4278
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:13,960
I don't know if you guys remember it, but they've done it before.

4279
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:16,200
This is not the first time they've done hero bans.

4280
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:18,700
Hero bans was like a thing.

4281
02:58:19,640 --> 02:58:20,080
Before.

4282
02:58:20,740 --> 02:58:22,620
It was like a long time ago.

4283
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:26,120
Where they tried... like each week... each week they ban a new hero.

4284
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:29,140
Jesus.

4285
02:58:30,600 --> 02:58:31,900
He did so much.

4286
02:58:31,920 --> 02:58:33,900
I think her Hammond is fucking dead.

4287
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:39,600
Oh no.

4288
02:58:39,860 --> 02:58:41,820
Maybe it was easier for Ana.

4289
02:58:41,900 --> 02:58:43,780
For you to play something that's not.

4290
02:58:44,380 --> 02:58:46,260
Maybe it's better if you don't play Ana.

4291
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:47,860
Because he's eating everything.

4292
02:58:48,860 --> 02:58:50,740
He's literally eating all your heals.

4293
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:52,360
All your nades.

4294
02:58:53,140 --> 02:58:54,060
Sorry man.

4295
02:58:54,260 --> 02:58:55,040
Sorry buddy.

4296
02:58:55,940 --> 02:58:57,020
Oh no.

4297
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:58,900
The moment I looked away.

4298
02:58:58,900 --> 02:59:01,940
The moment I looked away.

4299
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:07,180
Alright I have...

4300
02:59:07,180 --> 02:59:08,820
I think... I don't know.

4301
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:11,520
It's just a team diff.

4302
02:59:11,820 --> 02:59:14,860
Like I'm not playing a Lari which sucks for our team.

4303
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:17,820
Because like I feel like my Lari is much more of a...

4304
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:21,760
Much more of a debuff than a natural buff.

4305
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:24,060
Alright.

4306
02:59:24,060 --> 02:59:25,080
I don't have cleanse.

4307
02:59:25,260 --> 02:59:26,100
But he missed.

4308
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:28,320
He fucking missed.

4309
02:59:28,580 --> 02:59:29,160
Nerd.

4310
02:59:29,600 --> 02:59:30,980
He actually missed.

4311
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:31,780
What a loser.

4312
02:59:32,460 --> 02:59:33,040
Oh.

4313
02:59:38,760 --> 02:59:39,760
There you go.

4314
02:59:39,860 --> 02:59:40,380
You're alive.

4315
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:41,680
You're fucking...

4316
02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:42,860
Alright somebody killed this Ana.

4317
02:59:43,240 --> 02:59:44,060
Okay no?

4318
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:45,060
Alright that's fine.

4319
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:45,960
That's fine.

4320
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:49,160
Nobody wants to kill the Ana.

4321
02:59:52,480 --> 02:59:53,240
Fuck it.

4322
02:59:53,860 --> 02:59:55,300
This is...

4323
02:59:55,300 --> 02:59:56,080
This is...

4324
02:59:56,960 --> 02:59:57,680
It's time.

4325
02:59:57,740 --> 02:59:59,100
I think it's not winnable.

4326
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:00,780
So it's time to learn.

4327
03:00:07,420 --> 03:00:09,240
I don't think this is winnable.

4328
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:10,360
But it's time.

4329
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:12,340
It's time to learn.

4330
03:00:18,260 --> 03:00:19,000
Here we go.

4331
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:22,580
Woo!

4332
03:00:24,980 --> 03:00:26,480
Oh he has D.Va bomb.

4333
03:00:30,780 --> 03:00:31,260
Oh.

4334
03:00:31,280 --> 03:00:31,480
Oh.

4335
03:00:32,800 --> 03:00:33,360
Really?

4336
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:38,300
Woo!

4337
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:42,920
Alright where did you go?

4338
03:00:42,980 --> 03:00:43,600
What the fuck?

4339
03:00:45,100 --> 03:00:46,420
Okay that's not fair.

4340
03:00:46,500 --> 03:00:47,600
There's two of you guys.

4341
03:00:49,240 --> 03:00:51,000
It's time to learn Ilari.

4342
03:00:51,380 --> 03:00:52,560
No this team?

4343
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:54,880
There's no saving this...

4344
03:00:54,880 --> 03:00:55,320
I don't...

4345
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:56,420
We're all just bad.

4346
03:00:58,740 --> 03:00:59,880
This is just...

4347
03:00:59,880 --> 03:01:00,560
It's literally...

4348
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:00,980
I swear.

4349
03:01:01,240 --> 03:01:01,320
I...

4350
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:01,740
I...

4351
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:03,540
This feels like an uphill battle.

4352
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:03,600
I don't know.

4353
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:03,780
I don't know.

4354
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:06,260
I feel like we're not even gonna get that.

4355
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:09,000
We're not even gonna get the uphill battle.

4356
03:01:14,140 --> 03:01:14,740
That's good.

4357
03:01:17,320 --> 03:01:18,040
Thank God.

4358
03:01:25,850 --> 03:01:26,330
Woo!

4359
03:01:29,030 --> 03:01:31,030
I'm just gonna try and cat claim...

4360
03:01:31,030 --> 03:01:31,970
Claim the land!

4361
03:01:37,110 --> 03:01:38,070
Please live!

4362
03:01:39,130 --> 03:01:40,450
I'm trying to learn!

4363
03:01:40,470 --> 03:01:40,730
I'm trying to learn!

4364
03:01:40,750 --> 03:01:41,270
We got the play line!

4365
03:01:41,610 --> 03:01:41,990
Live!

4366
03:01:44,030 --> 03:01:44,910
Get in there!

4367
03:01:50,600 --> 03:01:51,460
Get in there!

4368
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:52,620
I'm gonna put this fucking here.

4369
03:01:52,720 --> 03:01:53,500
They can't get that, right?

4370
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:01,820
Alright.

4371
03:02:02,500 --> 03:02:03,200
Get in there!

4372
03:02:07,450 --> 03:02:08,070
He's one!

4373
03:02:08,210 --> 03:02:08,510
He's one!

4374
03:02:09,230 --> 03:02:09,750
Let's go!

4375
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:19,620
Get in the pylon!

4376
03:02:26,460 --> 03:02:27,660
What the fuck?

4377
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:28,440
Where is this?

4378
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:29,900
Where is the bomb?

4379
03:02:32,080 --> 03:02:35,120
I don't even know where the bomb was!

4380
03:02:38,530 --> 03:02:39,950
Like, where is the...

4381
03:02:39,950 --> 03:02:42,130
No, give me the ult charge, you fucking idiot!

4382
03:02:42,790 --> 03:02:43,270
Okay.

4383
03:02:45,390 --> 03:02:47,490
I literally could've got free ult charge.

4384
03:02:50,330 --> 03:02:51,430
That's the worst part.

4385
03:02:52,410 --> 03:02:54,230
I could've got free ult charge there.

4386
03:02:57,610 --> 03:02:58,370
Oh god.

4387
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:02,980
Okay, well...

4388
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:04,700
I got pylon up here, so...

4389
03:03:04,700 --> 03:03:06,080
It won't get healed.

4390
03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:07,320
This is... this is it.

4391
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:08,220
This is your chance.

4392
03:03:11,960 --> 03:03:12,440
Alright.

4393
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:13,620
Goodbye, Cassidy.

4394
03:03:14,580 --> 03:03:15,060
Hello!

4395
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:16,560
Oh, goodbye, Cassidy.

4396
03:03:16,660 --> 03:03:17,040
We tried.

4397
03:03:17,720 --> 03:03:19,200
We literally tried our best.

4398
03:03:20,600 --> 03:03:23,080
He outdamaged my fucking fly?!

4399
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:27,140
I don't know why he kept staying there, but like, okay.

4400
03:03:29,920 --> 03:03:30,400
Weee!

4401
03:03:31,360 --> 03:03:31,840
Alright.

4402
03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:32,020
Alright.

4403
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:35,580
But we're... me and the other support is doing so much healing.

4404
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:37,920
Yeah, he could've backed off!

4405
03:03:38,460 --> 03:03:39,600
Like, I don't know.

4406
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:40,780
I don't know.

4407
03:03:40,900 --> 03:03:42,640
Is that... you know...

4408
03:03:42,640 --> 03:03:44,360
Doesn't that seem like, logical?

4409
03:03:45,220 --> 03:03:46,380
But like, I don't know.

4410
03:03:46,560 --> 03:03:47,020
I don't know.

4411
03:03:47,400 --> 03:03:49,140
Maybe I just haven't played this game enough.

4412
03:03:52,960 --> 03:03:53,400
Maybe...

4413
03:03:53,400 --> 03:03:55,700
Maybe I just haven't played this game enough, apparently.

4414
03:03:59,020 --> 03:04:00,200
Oh god, thank god.

4415
03:04:00,740 --> 03:04:01,840
We're gonna stay here.

4416
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:05,220
How did our acu- Why?

4417
03:04:06,440 --> 03:04:09,900
Wait, why did they all went- Why did they- Okay.

4418
03:04:10,940 --> 03:04:12,020
Nothing makes sense!

4419
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:13,680
Nothing makes sense in this game!

4420
03:04:15,080 --> 03:04:16,540
Nothing makes sense in this game!

4421
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:21,400
It's okay.

4422
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:22,780
I don't know.

4423
03:04:23,160 --> 03:04:23,620
Alright.

4424
03:04:23,800 --> 03:04:25,020
We gotcha.

4425
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:25,800
Who do we avoid?

4426
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:28,540
Who do we not want on our team in the end?

4427
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:29,840
Out of everybody!

4428
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:31,480
Everybody we fought...

4429
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:32,840
Oh my gosh, not even uphill battle.

4430
03:04:32,960 --> 03:04:33,680
That's the worst part.

4431
03:04:33,940 --> 03:04:36,840
Is that- I don't know why.

4432
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:37,580
That's the thing.

4433
03:04:38,020 --> 03:04:41,180
The guy nano- nanowisered...

4434
03:04:42,180 --> 03:04:43,660
To like, one guy.

4435
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:45,960
The guy nanowisered one person.

4436
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:48,800
And then, our Kiriko...

4437
03:04:49,740 --> 03:04:51,620
TP'd to the nanowisor.

4438
03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:53,320
And I was so confused.

4439
03:04:53,580 --> 03:04:56,780
I was like, if you stayed under with the soldier and I...

4440
03:04:56,780 --> 03:04:58,260
Maybe she just wants to die.

4441
03:04:58,480 --> 03:04:59,820
Like, maybe she really wants to die.

4442
03:04:59,820 --> 03:05:00,920
Like, if she really really wanted to...

4443
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:02,340
Wanted to die there.

4444
03:05:03,440 --> 03:05:05,400
Just wanted to die a little faster.

4445
03:05:05,720 --> 03:05:06,740
I don't remember who Gamma is.

4446
03:05:07,020 --> 03:05:08,520
So, I guess goodbye Gamma.

4447
03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:09,380
You know what?

4448
03:05:09,640 --> 03:05:09,960
Okay.

4449
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:12,740
We'll clean it up.

4450
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:13,620
Um...

4451
03:05:13,620 --> 03:05:14,840
Who do we hate the most?

4452
03:05:15,460 --> 03:05:17,460
Who did we hate the most?

4453
03:05:17,580 --> 03:05:18,280
In the team.

4454
03:05:19,700 --> 03:05:22,480
Who do we not want on our team the most?

4455
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:23,380
Guys...

4456
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:24,600
Maybe...

4457
03:05:24,600 --> 03:05:25,580
Maybe our...

4458
03:05:25,580 --> 03:05:26,180
Our...

4459
03:05:26,760 --> 03:05:27,680
The other support.

4460
03:05:28,040 --> 03:05:29,720
Because they don't know how to play large.

4461
03:05:29,820 --> 03:05:30,780
The tank?

4462
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:31,600
Okay, the tank.

4463
03:05:31,860 --> 03:05:32,080
Alright.

4464
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:33,000
Goodbye tank.

4465
03:05:33,700 --> 03:05:34,300
Goodbye.

4466
03:05:34,640 --> 03:05:35,240
Goodbye.

4467
03:05:36,580 --> 03:05:38,400
They were all bad.

4468
03:05:38,980 --> 03:05:40,420
Like, I don't know how to pick.

4469
03:05:40,780 --> 03:05:42,940
They were all pretty terrible players.

4470
03:05:43,540 --> 03:05:44,460
As a team.

4471
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:46,600
We were all pretty terrible together as a team.

4472
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:47,280
There was just nothing.

4473
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:50,940
There was nothing.

4474
03:05:51,160 --> 03:05:52,580
I couldn't do anything about it.

4475
03:05:57,280 --> 03:05:58,360
Couldn't play Alari.

4476
03:05:59,400 --> 03:06:01,480
I was not the Alari player.

4477
03:06:02,380 --> 03:06:04,120
I mean, I could try playing Alari now.

4478
03:06:04,360 --> 03:06:06,040
Maybe I'll start training Alari now.

4479
03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:09,760
Oh, you saw that headshot though?

4480
03:06:10,140 --> 03:06:12,200
Fucking ran away like a little bitch.

4481
03:06:12,940 --> 03:06:15,640
Like a fucking little bitch boy.

4482
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:17,480
Oh.

4483
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:18,680
Oh my god.

4484
03:06:18,700 --> 03:06:19,820
Another fucking Rein player.

4485
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:24,540
Bye.

4486
03:06:25,100 --> 03:06:26,280
Oh my god!

4487
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:28,220
I'm getting shot by both angles!

4488
03:06:29,700 --> 03:06:31,420
The Alari training arc.

4489
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:32,720
This is it.

4490
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:37,120
This is it!

4491
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:37,800
Oh, please!

4492
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:40,780
There were three people on my screen!

4493
03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:42,260
I got confused!

4494
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:45,320
Why fucking...

4495
03:06:45,320 --> 03:06:48,020
Okay, I need to like heal myself first.

4496
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:49,380
I feel like.

4497
03:06:49,620 --> 03:06:51,060
I need to have like a heal beam.

4498
03:06:57,780 --> 03:06:58,280
Okay.

4499
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:03,420
Like, I'll take that, you know?

4500
03:07:11,220 --> 03:07:11,720
Oh.

4501
03:07:12,500 --> 03:07:13,420
Oh, they're all dead.

4502
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:13,680
Okay.

4503
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:14,280
Okay, okay.

4504
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:16,400
They're all dead!

4505
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:17,400
Alright.

4506
03:07:18,820 --> 03:07:19,500
Alright.

4507
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:21,320
Oh my god, Junker Queen, really?

4508
03:07:26,400 --> 03:07:27,380
Where's Bap?

4509
03:07:33,110 --> 03:07:33,450
No!

4510
03:07:33,790 --> 03:07:34,350
No!

4511
03:07:36,010 --> 03:07:36,690
No!

4512
03:07:36,690 --> 03:07:38,990
I can jump back!

4513
03:07:39,730 --> 03:07:41,390
Oh my god, that was so smart!

4514
03:07:42,830 --> 03:07:43,510
No!

4515
03:07:45,970 --> 03:07:47,110
He fucked me up!

4516
03:07:47,350 --> 03:07:48,510
He was smarter!

4517
03:07:49,910 --> 03:07:52,030
He was smarter than me!

4518
03:07:53,810 --> 03:07:54,450
Sucks.

4519
03:07:55,410 --> 03:07:57,990
Don't you hate it when they're just smarter than you?

4520
03:08:04,270 --> 03:08:04,910
Really?

4521
03:08:05,110 --> 03:08:05,630
Get away!

4522
03:08:06,450 --> 03:08:07,410
Leave the rock!

4523
03:08:07,950 --> 03:08:08,430
Oh!

4524
03:08:09,370 --> 03:08:10,750
That's fucking right, leave!

4525
03:08:11,750 --> 03:08:12,830
Leave the rock!

4526
03:08:15,030 --> 03:08:16,090
This is my rock!

4527
03:08:18,430 --> 03:08:19,070
Whoa!

4528
03:08:19,710 --> 03:08:19,990
Not

4529
03:08:23,950 --> 03:08:24,870
my rock anymore!

4530
03:08:25,130 --> 03:08:25,950
You can have it!

4531
03:08:28,170 --> 03:08:30,610
You can have the rock!

4532
03:08:30,770 --> 03:08:31,750
I don't want it!

4533
03:08:33,130 --> 03:08:35,130
The rock was too scary.

4534
03:08:40,540 --> 03:08:40,840
Whoa!

4535
03:08:40,980 --> 03:08:42,080
What the fuck is this tank?

4536
03:08:42,660 --> 03:08:43,460
Get away!

4537
03:08:44,740 --> 03:08:46,800
What is this tank versus tank fight?

4538
03:08:49,620 --> 03:08:50,380
Wee-ro!

4539
03:08:52,620 --> 03:08:54,780
You fucked this guy in particular.

4540
03:08:56,400 --> 03:08:56,700
Ha!

4541
03:08:59,810 --> 03:09:02,230
Apparently to activate it, he has to have the rock.

4542
03:09:02,230 --> 03:09:04,750
I'm like taking a specific amount of damage!

4543
03:09:06,190 --> 03:09:08,350
Fuck that one guy in particular though.

4544
03:09:08,730 --> 03:09:09,410
What's that?

4545
03:09:09,710 --> 03:09:10,770
Is that my pylon?

4546
03:09:12,150 --> 03:09:12,330
Whoa!

4547
03:09:12,730 --> 03:09:13,730
That's fucked up!

4548
03:09:13,750 --> 03:09:14,270
That's evil.

4549
03:09:17,950 --> 03:09:19,050
Oh my gosh!

4550
03:09:19,310 --> 03:09:20,390
I keep forgetting that doesn't heal.

4551
03:09:21,250 --> 03:09:22,810
I want to use that as like a heal.

4552
03:09:22,990 --> 03:09:23,790
For escape...

4553
03:09:23,790 --> 03:09:25,970
... ability but it doesn't do that.

4554
03:09:27,590 --> 03:09:29,110
I got eliminated by cringe.

4555
03:09:30,110 --> 03:09:31,750
I hate it when...

4556
03:09:31,750 --> 03:09:34,590
... when they eliminate you by cringe.

4557
03:09:35,550 --> 03:09:36,670
What the fuck?

4558
03:09:43,300 --> 03:09:44,020
That's right.

4559
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:44,800
Get headshot.

4560
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:47,320
Get headshot, bitch.

4561
03:09:50,160 --> 03:09:50,840
Nice.

4562
03:09:56,330 --> 03:09:57,090
Come on!

4563
03:09:59,270 --> 03:10:00,870
Let me kill this guy first!

4564
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:02,730
Come

4565
03:10:07,260 --> 03:10:07,420
on!

4566
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:08,020
Yeah!

4567
03:10:08,100 --> 03:10:08,740
That's right!

4568
03:10:08,880 --> 03:10:09,240
Come on!

4569
03:10:09,240 --> 03:10:10,600
Should've shot my pylon.

4570
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:14,060
That's fucking right.

4571
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:16,080
Wait, where did my pylon go?

4572
03:10:16,120 --> 03:10:16,260
Oh, there.

4573
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:19,240
Whoops.

4574
03:10:19,560 --> 03:10:20,040
No!

4575
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:20,700
My pylon!

4576
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:26,160
What the fuck?

4577
03:10:28,500 --> 03:10:29,240
Who's that?

4578
03:10:30,240 --> 03:10:32,340
Where did the Kiriko come from?

4579
03:10:36,140 --> 03:10:38,000
Please give me a support that plays Ilari.

4580
03:10:39,240 --> 03:10:40,520
Oh, I got Masters 2.

4581
03:10:40,820 --> 03:10:42,500
Okay, getting a little serious now.

4582
03:10:42,700 --> 03:10:43,900
Masters 2 is top 500.

4583
03:10:45,180 --> 03:10:46,880
Getting a little more serious.

4584
03:10:48,460 --> 03:10:49,020
Alright.

4585
03:10:49,460 --> 03:10:50,300
Can I go...

4586
03:10:50,300 --> 03:10:51,420
... Senada?

4587
03:10:56,180 --> 03:10:57,480
I can't believe it.

4588
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:58,720
The Kiriko came in...

4589
03:10:58,720 --> 03:10:59,840
... to protect me.

4590
03:10:59,940 --> 03:11:02,040
Like, where the fuck did the Kiriko come from?

4591
03:11:02,600 --> 03:11:04,020
It's like out of nowhere.

4592
03:11:05,380 --> 03:11:05,940
Literally...

4593
03:11:07,180 --> 03:11:10,340
... turned around and then the Kiriko popped up.

4594
03:11:11,960 --> 03:11:13,820
The two kys are subject to the same acceleration.

4595
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:16,120
The threat between them snaps.

4596
03:11:17,940 --> 03:11:18,420
Fascinating...

4597
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:19,320
Fascinating.

4598
03:11:25,020 --> 03:11:26,620
One more mission, huh?

4599
03:11:27,400 --> 03:11:28,060
I'm in.

4600
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:29,660
Alright, here we go.

4601
03:11:31,580 --> 03:11:32,240
Oh, God.

4602
03:11:32,300 --> 03:11:33,300
I hope they don't play Sigma.

4603
03:11:33,460 --> 03:11:35,640
If they play Sigma, I'm gonna fucking swap.

4604
03:11:36,240 --> 03:11:38,340
I hate playing Senada against the Sigma.

4605
03:11:38,680 --> 03:11:39,620
It's like the worst.

4606
03:11:44,460 --> 03:11:46,400
I hope the enemy team doesn't have a Sigma.

4607
03:11:46,400 --> 03:11:49,000
Zenyatta against Sigma is not fun to play because of the shield.

4608
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:50,380
Like, I can't shoot anything.

4609
03:11:51,260 --> 03:11:53,260
The shield refresh is just too good.

4610
03:11:54,440 --> 03:11:55,240
Oh, Rein.

4611
03:11:55,440 --> 03:11:55,980
I can play Rein.

4612
03:11:56,120 --> 03:11:57,480
Yeah, Rein is good against Sigma.

4613
03:11:57,920 --> 03:11:59,220
I mean, against...

4614
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:03,580
He cleansed it.

4615
03:12:03,680 --> 03:12:05,660
Oh no, not the fucking Mora.

4616
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:07,000
I'm trying!

4617
03:12:07,140 --> 03:12:07,620
I'm trying!

4618
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:11,540
How did he die?

4619
03:12:12,220 --> 03:12:13,540
How the f- What?!

4620
03:12:13,540 --> 03:12:15,380
How did we lose two?!

4621
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:18,340
Already?!

4622
03:12:20,600 --> 03:12:23,520
How did we lose two people already?!

4623
03:12:25,170 --> 03:12:27,240
Oh, he fucking actually deflected that.

4624
03:12:28,160 --> 03:12:29,240
That's actually crazy.

4625
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:31,260
We already lost two people.

4626
03:12:33,860 --> 03:12:37,380
Alright, come on!

4627
03:12:41,110 --> 03:12:42,210
It's just a run!

4628
03:12:42,310 --> 03:12:43,330
He's just walking there!

4629
03:12:43,910 --> 03:12:44,810
He missed!

4630
03:12:47,170 --> 03:12:48,770
He missed the walking!

4631
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:51,110
Wait, what?

4632
03:12:51,330 --> 03:12:51,770
DPS?

4633
03:12:52,510 --> 03:12:53,050
DPS?

4634
03:12:53,390 --> 03:12:54,610
Oh no, DPS!

4635
03:12:55,030 --> 03:12:55,570
DPS!

4636
03:12:55,810 --> 03:12:56,730
We're coming over!

4637
03:12:56,790 --> 03:12:57,090
DPS!

4638
03:12:59,670 --> 03:13:00,370
He's low!

4639
03:13:00,470 --> 03:13:00,770
He's low!

4640
03:13:02,550 --> 03:13:03,810
Wait, where did Lucio go?

4641
03:13:05,450 --> 03:13:06,850
What the fuck happened?

4642
03:13:08,170 --> 03:13:09,410
Oh, he's just wall riding.

4643
03:13:09,790 --> 03:13:10,490
That's fine.

4644
03:13:10,550 --> 03:13:11,430
Let him wall ride!

4645
03:13:12,330 --> 03:13:13,330
Let him run!

4646
03:13:13,570 --> 03:13:14,790
Oh, he's just wall riding.

4647
03:13:14,810 --> 03:13:15,330
DPS, please.

4648
03:13:16,850 --> 03:13:18,590
No, he's literally one!

4649
03:13:18,790 --> 03:13:19,730
I'm so sad!

4650
03:13:20,130 --> 03:13:21,310
I'm so sad!

4651
03:13:23,130 --> 03:13:24,690
He was literally one!

4652
03:13:27,690 --> 03:13:29,310
Alright, I have ult soon.

4653
03:13:29,850 --> 03:13:31,590
Wait, I have ult before the Ana?

4654
03:13:31,710 --> 03:13:32,690
Oh wait, no, because he swapped.

4655
03:13:32,870 --> 03:13:33,290
I was gonna say.

4656
03:13:33,570 --> 03:13:34,970
What the fuck do I have ult before?

4657
03:13:36,870 --> 03:13:37,950
Oh, that's fine.

4658
03:13:38,970 --> 03:13:39,730
That's fine.

4659
03:13:39,890 --> 03:13:41,250
He's just refreshing me ult.

4660
03:13:41,530 --> 03:13:42,510
We're gonna have Mora ult.

4661
03:13:43,490 --> 03:13:44,450
And maybe...

4662
03:13:44,450 --> 03:13:45,470
Reinhardt?

4663
03:13:45,470 --> 03:13:45,690
Maybe?

4664
03:13:46,370 --> 03:13:47,430
I don't know.

4665
03:13:47,690 --> 03:13:50,190
I don't know if he's actually been doing much.

4666
03:13:51,270 --> 03:13:53,010
I have to not get shattered.

4667
03:13:53,570 --> 03:13:54,970
That's like the hardest thing.

4668
03:13:55,670 --> 03:13:56,910
Just don't get shattered.

4669
03:13:58,890 --> 03:13:59,450
Okay.

4670
03:14:00,190 --> 03:14:00,750
Okay.

4671
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:06,660
Wait, what?

4672
03:14:07,800 --> 03:14:08,360
Okay.

4673
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:10,900
I mean...

4674
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:11,860
I'm okay!

4675
03:14:15,160 --> 03:14:16,140
I'll take it.

4676
03:14:18,020 --> 03:14:18,840
Wait, what?

4677
03:14:19,660 --> 03:14:20,780
Try and have shatter.

4678
03:14:20,940 --> 03:14:21,360
Still.

4679
03:14:26,780 --> 03:14:27,580
I'm scared.

4680
03:14:27,800 --> 03:14:29,040
I'm scared of this guy.

4681
03:14:29,500 --> 03:14:30,160
Don't worry!

4682
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:31,860
I won't!

4683
03:14:31,860 --> 03:14:32,340
I cannot.

4684
03:14:32,480 --> 03:14:32,900
I'm sorry.

4685
03:14:35,800 --> 03:14:38,160
I'm not a miracle worker.

4686
03:14:44,440 --> 03:14:45,640
Holy shit!

4687
03:14:46,660 --> 03:14:48,240
Bro, what the...

4688
03:14:50,380 --> 03:14:51,920
Oh my god!

4689
03:14:53,120 --> 03:14:54,940
I'm not... I'm not...

4690
03:14:57,550 --> 03:14:59,730
I couldn't take it for him.

4691
03:14:59,930 --> 03:15:00,790
I tried!

4692
03:15:00,910 --> 03:15:02,630
I ran in front of it!

4693
03:15:03,370 --> 03:15:06,090
I... Did you not see me right in front of it?

4694
03:15:06,450 --> 03:15:07,030
I...

4695
03:15:07,030 --> 03:15:11,370
I actually ran in front of it!

4696
03:15:11,650 --> 03:15:13,070
But I couldn't!

4697
03:15:13,610 --> 03:15:14,190
Yes.

4698
03:15:16,130 --> 03:15:17,170
Oh no!

4699
03:15:18,330 --> 03:15:19,390
Alright, I swap.

4700
03:15:19,890 --> 03:15:20,910
I'll go to Kiriko.

4701
03:15:21,810 --> 03:15:22,870
Everybody's too split.

4702
03:15:23,290 --> 03:15:24,370
It doesn't matter.

4703
03:15:25,230 --> 03:15:27,150
Everybody's way too split.

4704
03:15:28,670 --> 03:15:29,870
For Zenyatta.

4705
03:15:30,530 --> 03:15:33,470
I might be getting kills, but it doesn't matter.

4706
03:15:33,830 --> 03:15:33,850
Can you jump up?

4707
03:15:33,990 --> 03:15:34,450
I need help.

4708
03:15:38,460 --> 03:15:40,040
Can you try to get to you?

4709
03:15:41,700 --> 03:15:42,440
We're here!

4710
03:15:42,500 --> 03:15:42,960
She's dead.

4711
03:15:43,260 --> 03:15:44,100
We're here!

4712
03:15:50,880 --> 03:15:51,920
We're here!

4713
03:15:54,360 --> 03:15:55,400
Get shatter!

4714
03:15:56,660 --> 03:15:58,040
Oh, that's fucked up!

4715
03:15:58,040 --> 03:15:58,380
Fuck up.

4716
03:16:02,170 --> 03:16:03,130
That's fucked up!

4717
03:16:08,940 --> 03:16:09,620
We're trying.

4718
03:16:10,020 --> 03:16:11,400
I'm trying my best.

4719
03:16:15,080 --> 03:16:15,840
Ohhh!

4720
03:16:17,400 --> 03:16:18,940
That's fucked up!

4721
03:16:21,940 --> 03:16:25,060
We're trying our best to keep you up.

4722
03:16:25,820 --> 03:16:27,200
Oh my god!

4723
03:16:27,300 --> 03:16:27,680
Please!

4724
03:16:28,220 --> 03:16:28,600
Yeah!

4725
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:29,240
Everybody!

4726
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:34,880
You're all so separated!

4727
03:16:41,500 --> 03:16:43,740
You're all so separated!

4728
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:49,040
Oh god.

4729
03:16:49,340 --> 03:16:52,480
Trying everything I can to keep you all up.

4730
03:16:57,520 --> 03:16:58,340
Please!

4731
03:16:59,060 --> 03:16:59,880
LEAVE!

4732
03:17:00,340 --> 03:17:01,160
LEAVE!

4733
03:17:06,610 --> 03:17:07,020
Jesus!

4734
03:17:07,380 --> 03:17:08,200
LEAVE!

4735
03:17:08,460 --> 03:17:09,280
LEAVE!

4736
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:13,260
We're alive.

4737
03:17:13,600 --> 03:17:14,420
We're alive.

4738
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:15,160
We're alive.

4739
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:15,640
We're alive.

4740
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:19,020
It's okay.

4741
03:17:20,140 --> 03:17:20,900
It's okay.

4742
03:17:21,040 --> 03:17:21,500
We're okay.

4743
03:17:23,880 --> 03:17:25,220
That's why I went Kiriko!

4744
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:30,000
I might have been killing people at Zenyatta, but everybody was everywhere!

4745
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:31,900
There was no point!

4746
03:17:34,760 --> 03:17:36,520
Everybody was just everywhere!

4747
03:17:40,060 --> 03:17:41,360
Where do I go?

4748
03:17:44,500 --> 03:17:45,100
I don't know.

4749
03:17:45,100 --> 03:17:45,500
Give me a chunk.

4750
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:47,280
There you go.

4751
03:17:48,040 --> 03:17:50,800
There you go, Junkrat.

4752
03:17:50,840 --> 03:17:51,780
I don't know why I said Jack.

4753
03:17:52,560 --> 03:17:53,260
Zero one, zero one.

4754
03:17:59,510 --> 03:18:00,110
Oh!

4755
03:18:00,110 --> 03:18:00,930
You're alive!

4756
03:18:01,350 --> 03:18:02,270
You're alive!

4757
03:18:03,590 --> 03:18:04,190
LEAVE!

4758
03:18:07,090 --> 03:18:08,670
What the fuck?

4759
03:18:10,330 --> 03:18:11,270
Give me up!

4760
03:18:11,450 --> 03:18:11,910
No!

4761
03:18:15,730 --> 03:18:16,210
Jackrat!

4762
03:18:17,010 --> 03:18:17,490
Please!

4763
03:18:17,890 --> 03:18:20,050
Why do we not have a single kill?

4764
03:18:20,430 --> 03:18:22,490
I know it's after all of that.

4765
03:18:23,990 --> 03:18:27,130
We don't have a single kill after all of that.

4766
03:18:27,850 --> 03:18:29,090
It's actually so sad.

4767
03:18:30,150 --> 03:18:31,630
How do we not have a kill?

4768
03:18:31,950 --> 03:18:33,150
I felt like...

4769
03:18:33,550 --> 03:18:34,750
Oh my god, Junkrat.

4770
03:18:34,890 --> 03:18:35,870
Holy shi- Oh.

4771
03:18:36,650 --> 03:18:37,130
Oh!

4772
03:18:37,210 --> 03:18:37,750
Two down!

4773
03:18:37,930 --> 03:18:38,270
Two down!

4774
03:18:38,350 --> 03:18:38,510
Go!

4775
03:18:38,610 --> 03:18:38,770
Go!

4776
03:18:38,790 --> 03:18:38,930
Go!

4777
03:18:39,350 --> 03:18:40,130
Two down!

4778
03:18:43,090 --> 03:18:43,850
We're faster!

4779
03:18:45,230 --> 03:18:46,390
Literally two down!

4780
03:18:46,850 --> 03:18:47,590
Oh no.

4781
03:18:47,970 --> 03:18:48,930
He doesn't have grab.

4782
03:18:49,050 --> 03:18:49,590
There's no way.

4783
03:18:49,870 --> 03:18:51,770
He'll have it in the next fight, I think.

4784
03:18:52,150 --> 03:18:54,210
There's no fucking way he gets grab there.

4785
03:18:56,490 --> 03:18:56,970
Okay.

4786
03:18:58,270 --> 03:18:59,270
Oh my god.

4787
03:19:00,270 --> 03:19:01,150
There it is.

4788
03:19:02,110 --> 03:19:03,170
There it is.

4789
03:19:04,270 --> 03:19:05,270
There it is!

4790
03:19:06,430 --> 03:19:07,130
There it is!

4791
03:19:09,130 --> 03:19:09,770
Let's live.

4792
03:19:09,950 --> 03:19:10,110
Let's live.

4793
03:19:10,110 --> 03:19:10,590
Live.

4794
03:19:10,590 --> 03:19:10,890
Please.

4795
03:19:11,410 --> 03:19:13,790
We're trying so hard to keep you up right now.

4796
03:19:15,050 --> 03:19:15,490
Please.

4797
03:19:16,090 --> 03:19:16,750
Please live.

4798
03:19:16,970 --> 03:19:18,950
Okay, I had a feeling that was gonna happen too.

4799
03:19:19,890 --> 03:19:20,330
Please!

4800
03:19:20,510 --> 03:19:20,730
No!

4801
03:19:22,590 --> 03:19:24,050
I can't hear the tire!

4802
03:19:24,170 --> 03:19:24,970
If I could, I would!

4803
03:19:27,790 --> 03:19:28,670
I would.

4804
03:19:30,090 --> 03:19:30,970
Oh, no.

4805
03:19:32,610 --> 03:19:33,050
Please.

4806
03:19:33,050 --> 03:19:33,850
I can touch.

4807
03:19:35,770 --> 03:19:36,970
I can maybe touch.

4808
03:19:41,110 --> 03:19:41,950
Zarya one.

4809
03:19:42,330 --> 03:19:45,810
We got

4810
03:19:50,250 --> 03:19:50,550
on!

4811
03:19:51,730 --> 03:19:54,330
But - I don't know how- I can live!

4812
03:19:56,850 --> 03:19:57,490
Touch!

4813
03:19:57,710 --> 03:19:58,270
Touch!

4814
03:19:58,630 --> 03:19:59,270
No!

4815
03:19:59,690 --> 03:20:00,310
The orb!

4816
03:20:01,330 --> 03:20:02,610
The orb!

4817
03:20:04,510 --> 03:20:06,290
The fucking orb!

4818
03:20:06,590 --> 03:20:07,310
Junkrat, it's you!

4819
03:20:08,110 --> 03:20:09,590
Go, Junkrat, go!

4820
03:20:10,150 --> 03:20:10,670
GO!

4821
03:20:11,390 --> 03:20:12,270
Oh, it's over.

4822
03:20:14,550 --> 03:20:15,870
I can't believe it!

4823
03:20:15,930 --> 03:20:17,790
The orb wasn't even for me!

4824
03:20:20,170 --> 03:20:23,010
The orb wasn't even for me!

4825
03:20:23,510 --> 03:20:30,010
It wasn't even targeted at me!

4826
03:20:30,470 --> 03:20:32,230
That's the worst part!

4827
03:20:35,490 --> 03:20:36,990
Holy shit.

4828
03:20:37,350 --> 03:20:40,010
That was actually the worst part.

4829
03:20:40,350 --> 03:20:43,010
That the orb wasn't targeted to me.

4830
03:20:44,550 --> 03:20:44,770
I don't know.

4831
03:20:44,770 --> 03:20:45,810
I don't know what to play.

4832
03:20:47,430 --> 03:20:48,910
I guess I'll go Kiriko.

4833
03:20:54,370 --> 03:20:56,530
This team is not organized at all.

4834
03:20:56,610 --> 03:20:59,110
This team fucking... I don't know.

4835
03:20:59,250 --> 03:21:00,190
Maybe it's time.

4836
03:21:00,270 --> 03:21:01,330
Maybe it's time to learn Ilari.

4837
03:21:03,590 --> 03:21:04,570
Maybe it's time.

4838
03:21:06,950 --> 03:21:08,650
This team is not organized.

4839
03:21:09,830 --> 03:21:10,690
One life.

4840
03:21:10,830 --> 03:21:11,730
One life Ilari.

4841
03:21:14,790 --> 03:21:15,610
One life.

4842
03:21:18,110 --> 03:21:19,970
Alright, I'm gonna avoid the Junkrat though.

4843
03:21:20,170 --> 03:21:23,830
Put it here.

4844
03:21:27,910 --> 03:21:30,510
This team is all over the place.

4845
03:21:30,550 --> 03:21:31,290
We're not playing together.

4846
03:21:31,570 --> 03:21:32,110
That's the thing.

4847
03:21:32,550 --> 03:21:34,650
This team does not play together at all.

4848
03:21:35,130 --> 03:21:37,690
So it's really difficult to heal.

4849
03:21:39,690 --> 03:21:42,490
I have to follow one... I can only heal one person.

4850
03:21:43,070 --> 03:21:44,270
I have to choose wisely.

4851
03:21:44,550 --> 03:21:44,990
One.

4852
03:21:46,010 --> 03:21:46,790
Attackers in...

4853
03:21:46,790 --> 03:21:48,330
Yeah, the Junkrat is definitely not doing it.

4854
03:21:48,390 --> 03:21:48,810
No.

4855
03:21:49,290 --> 03:21:51,450
I don't think they got anything with their... at all.

4856
03:21:56,860 --> 03:21:57,580
Oh, nice.

4857
03:22:03,430 --> 03:22:03,910
Alright.

4858
03:22:09,070 --> 03:22:09,910
Oh shit.

4859
03:22:10,010 --> 03:22:10,590
I'm trying!

4860
03:22:10,870 --> 03:22:11,530
You gotta heal me, yo.

4861
03:22:12,830 --> 03:22:13,810
You are very strong.

4862
03:22:14,210 --> 03:22:14,690
No!

4863
03:22:15,830 --> 03:22:17,430
Alright, I used my one life.

4864
03:22:17,770 --> 03:22:18,970
I'll go Kiriko now.

4865
03:22:19,310 --> 03:22:20,810
I used my one life.

4866
03:22:21,130 --> 03:22:22,430
This is full time.

4867
03:22:23,050 --> 03:22:24,010
I fucking... I'm...

4868
03:22:24,010 --> 03:22:24,010
I'm...

4869
03:22:24,010 --> 03:22:26,850
I'm not... I cannot play Lara against full time.

4870
03:22:37,480 --> 03:22:38,980
That's unlucky for me.

4871
03:22:39,800 --> 03:22:40,960
Oh no.

4872
03:22:43,320 --> 03:22:44,040
No!

4873
03:22:46,560 --> 03:22:48,960
I wanted to come back!

4874
03:22:52,320 --> 03:22:53,500
That's so unlucky.

4875
03:22:56,080 --> 03:23:00,000
Yeah, that was... that was a hard...

4876
03:23:02,740 --> 03:23:03,220
Bro.

4877
03:23:03,660 --> 03:23:04,800
Where are you?

4878
03:23:04,880 --> 03:23:05,800
Where are you?

4879
03:23:06,040 --> 03:23:06,520
Where?

4880
03:23:07,180 --> 03:23:08,280
Where did he go?

4881
03:23:12,060 --> 03:23:13,740
Yeah, this is...

4882
03:23:17,780 --> 03:23:18,640
He's over there.

4883
03:23:19,240 --> 03:23:20,300
Oh, he fell.

4884
03:23:20,440 --> 03:23:20,840
Okay.

4885
03:23:22,760 --> 03:23:23,240
Okay.

4886
03:23:23,560 --> 03:23:24,280
That works.

4887
03:23:30,460 --> 03:23:33,260
Okay, I don't know if I should... we should chase, but okay.

4888
03:23:37,230 --> 03:23:37,670
Alright.

4889
03:23:37,890 --> 03:23:40,810
They're not gonna have any ults, because that was such a fast fight.

4890
03:23:43,030 --> 03:23:44,030
Oh, I'm doing my best.

4891
03:23:45,770 --> 03:23:46,210
Oh.

4892
03:23:47,350 --> 03:23:47,790
Oh.

4893
03:23:53,660 --> 03:23:54,740
They have it all.

4894
03:23:55,300 --> 03:23:56,160
Separated us all.

4895
03:23:56,640 --> 03:23:57,780
Bro, what the fuck?

4896
03:23:57,820 --> 03:23:58,820
Why are they all ulting us?

4897
03:23:58,900 --> 03:23:59,260
We're dead!

4898
03:23:59,820 --> 03:24:00,260
Please!

4899
03:24:00,280 --> 03:24:01,080
We're already dead!

4900
03:24:02,480 --> 03:24:04,020
We're... they're already dead!

4901
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:06,460
You don't need to keep going!

4902
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:08,700
Yeah, I'm good.

4903
03:24:08,760 --> 03:24:09,160
They're gonna gult, though.

4904
03:24:09,280 --> 03:24:09,560
Oh.

4905
03:24:10,240 --> 03:24:11,120
They're gonna gult.

4906
03:24:11,220 --> 03:24:13,220
We have nothing that can counter...

4907
03:24:14,580 --> 03:24:15,080
Hymen.

4908
03:24:15,320 --> 03:24:16,960
If we have Sombra, maybe?

4909
03:24:17,200 --> 03:24:18,600
I think we should get Sombra.

4910
03:24:19,100 --> 03:24:19,600
Honestly.

4911
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:21,300
They have nan...

4912
03:24:23,820 --> 03:24:24,320
Goodbye.

4913
03:24:27,180 --> 03:24:28,680
This is where we die.

4914
03:24:30,500 --> 03:24:31,500
Holy shit!

4915
03:24:32,040 --> 03:24:33,240
This team's a mess!

4916
03:24:33,740 --> 03:24:35,200
We're a mess right now!

4917
03:24:36,020 --> 03:24:37,040
Why are we dying?

4918
03:24:37,140 --> 03:24:37,640
They're dying.

4919
03:24:38,020 --> 03:24:38,740
They have no shield.

4920
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:40,740
Are we dying to die?

4921
03:24:40,860 --> 03:24:42,060
We have a Junkrat!

4922
03:24:45,120 --> 03:24:45,500
Guys!

4923
03:24:46,340 --> 03:24:48,620
Did you not see that we have a Junkrat?

4924
03:24:50,740 --> 03:24:52,640
He could be the best Junkrat in the world!

4925
03:24:53,120 --> 03:24:54,780
But we still haven't...

4926
03:24:54,780 --> 03:24:55,460
Oh, thank god.

4927
03:24:55,520 --> 03:24:55,920
This is a...

4928
03:24:55,920 --> 03:24:57,420
This area is junk, though.

4929
03:24:57,740 --> 03:24:58,280
At least.

4930
03:25:00,400 --> 03:25:00,780
Alright!

4931
03:25:00,900 --> 03:25:02,000
There you go, Junk!

4932
03:25:04,500 --> 03:25:06,720
Yeah, but we don't have enough heals for Brig, Lucio.

4933
03:25:07,360 --> 03:25:07,920
That's the thing.

4934
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:08,660
We're running, Lucio.

4935
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:11,060
We don't have enough heals for that.

4936
03:25:12,460 --> 03:25:17,820
I have to run a heal-intensive character, and I either go Mora or Kiriko, but we need the cleanse.

4937
03:25:18,640 --> 03:25:19,960
Because of the Genghis.

4938
03:25:21,820 --> 03:25:23,660
Guys, we just need to hold this for four minutes!

4939
03:25:24,560 --> 03:25:25,160
That's fine!

4940
03:25:28,060 --> 03:25:29,760
Let's just hold this for four minutes!

4941
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:31,960
Oh, there you go!

4942
03:25:32,120 --> 03:25:32,820
They backed off!

4943
03:25:33,020 --> 03:25:34,680
I bought us some time, guys!

4944
03:25:35,940 --> 03:25:37,200
Guys, I bought us some time!

4945
03:25:39,540 --> 03:25:40,900
They're running Czar now.

4946
03:25:41,800 --> 03:25:42,420
It's okay!

4947
03:25:42,700 --> 03:25:43,780
Now we have...

4948
03:25:43,780 --> 03:25:44,780
They lost one fight!

4949
03:25:46,020 --> 03:25:47,520
They lost two fights!

4950
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:54,760
That's fine!

4951
03:25:58,200 --> 03:25:59,040
Oh my god.

4952
03:25:59,180 --> 03:25:59,620
That's good.

4953
03:25:59,700 --> 03:25:59,880
That's good.

4954
03:26:00,020 --> 03:26:00,960
He lost his ult charge.

4955
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:03,340
They just need one ult, though.

4956
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:04,540
What the fuck?

4957
03:26:04,580 --> 03:26:05,560
Where's our Tracer fighting?

4958
03:26:06,180 --> 03:26:07,000
Her demons?

4959
03:26:09,220 --> 03:26:11,040
Okay, we have a beat for a grab.

4960
03:26:11,160 --> 03:26:11,520
We got...

4961
03:26:13,400 --> 03:26:16,260
They are trying to rely on Nano Blade, I think.

4962
03:26:16,460 --> 03:26:17,580
Oh, and Echo.

4963
03:26:17,800 --> 03:26:18,280
So...

4964
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:21,000
Echo D.Va or some shit.

4965
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:25,960
I can't shoot because I don't wanna die!

4966
03:26:28,540 --> 03:26:31,600
I don't wanna die so I'm healbotting right now!

4967
03:26:32,640 --> 03:26:34,500
I can't just peek up!

4968
03:26:35,540 --> 03:26:37,280
Alright, let's just...

4969
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:44,460
What the fuck is going on right now?

4970
03:26:44,960 --> 03:26:46,620
Get over here, get the Zerg!

4971
03:26:46,800 --> 03:26:46,840
Nice!

4972
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:50,180
Alright, they still have Nano Blade.

4973
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:52,980
No, they don't!

4974
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:53,520
They just have Blade!

4975
03:26:57,020 --> 03:26:59,080
Okay, I don't wanna fucking push that.

4976
03:26:59,920 --> 03:27:02,180
I'm not gonna be...

4977
03:27:04,040 --> 03:27:05,720
I'm not gonna fucking DPS.

4978
03:27:05,960 --> 03:27:08,140
If I die we're fucked because I'm like the main healer.

4979
03:27:08,480 --> 03:27:10,000
So I have to play much more safe.

4980
03:27:10,500 --> 03:27:11,420
You're gonna have to...

4981
03:27:11,420 --> 03:27:12,600
Eat the ground, D.Va!

4982
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:14,560
Eat the ground!

4983
03:27:14,660 --> 03:27:15,840
What the fuck?

4984
03:27:15,940 --> 03:27:16,300
Okay.

4985
03:27:16,620 --> 03:27:18,140
Two more minutes of this, guys!

4986
03:27:19,100 --> 03:27:20,680
Two more minutes of this!

4987
03:27:23,960 --> 03:27:24,520
Let's go!

4988
03:27:25,580 --> 03:27:27,360
Oh, let's not go.

4989
03:27:29,380 --> 03:27:29,820
Let's...

4990
03:27:34,880 --> 03:27:35,760
not go.

4991
03:27:35,960 --> 03:27:36,460
I guess.

4992
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:39,420
Alright.

4993
03:27:40,200 --> 03:27:40,900
I won from that.

4994
03:27:41,540 --> 03:27:42,300
Yeah, go Rein.

4995
03:27:42,440 --> 03:27:42,540
Go Rein.

4996
03:27:42,880 --> 03:27:44,360
They have no B, no Blade.

4997
03:27:45,440 --> 03:27:46,300
They missed Grav.

4998
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:49,740
I got you!

4999
03:27:49,820 --> 03:27:50,320
I got you!

5000
03:27:57,540 --> 03:27:58,220
Don't worry!

5001
03:27:58,280 --> 03:27:58,960
I got you!

5002
03:27:59,400 --> 03:28:00,100
This is your one.

5003
03:28:00,780 --> 03:28:01,180
Okay.

5004
03:28:02,560 --> 03:28:03,460
Two more minutes!

5005
03:28:04,640 --> 03:28:05,860
Two more minutes of health!

5006
03:28:06,320 --> 03:28:06,640
You wanna swap?

5007
03:28:07,860 --> 03:28:08,520
Yeah, yeah.

5008
03:28:09,760 --> 03:28:10,160
Go!

5009
03:28:10,240 --> 03:28:10,380
Go!

5010
03:28:10,380 --> 03:28:10,660
Go!

5011
03:28:10,680 --> 03:28:11,000
Go!

5012
03:28:11,220 --> 03:28:11,380
Go!

5013
03:28:11,380 --> 03:28:11,520
Lucille?

5014
03:28:11,620 --> 03:28:11,840
Let's go!

5015
03:28:11,840 --> 03:28:12,100
Lucille taxi in!

5016
03:28:12,400 --> 03:28:14,720
Lucille, we need you in taxi!

5017
03:28:16,740 --> 03:28:17,300
Morgan!

5018
03:28:17,780 --> 03:28:19,380
No, we're at the point!

5019
03:28:19,520 --> 03:28:20,040
This is it!

5020
03:28:20,120 --> 03:28:22,680
This is the infamous tank counterswap!

5021
03:28:23,640 --> 03:28:28,020
This is the infamous tank counterswap battle!

5022
03:28:31,420 --> 03:28:32,800
This is it!

5023
03:28:32,940 --> 03:28:37,480
I told you, guys, the fable tank counterswaps battle!

5024
03:28:37,480 --> 03:28:37,820
I don't...

5025
03:28:42,040 --> 03:28:43,380
Oh my god.

5026
03:28:46,820 --> 03:28:47,440
One fight.

5027
03:28:48,640 --> 03:28:49,500
Hell has arrived.

5028
03:28:55,420 --> 03:28:55,720
Okay.

5029
03:28:55,920 --> 03:28:57,160
Is he gonna swap Monkey?

5030
03:28:57,440 --> 03:28:58,720
Sigma vs Sigma!

5031
03:28:58,900 --> 03:28:59,240
Let's go!

5032
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:04,260
One minute left.

5033
03:29:04,340 --> 03:29:05,300
They need one fight.

5034
03:29:05,300 --> 03:29:06,800
Literally one fight.

5035
03:29:08,400 --> 03:29:10,120
I don't know if they'll have Blaine.

5036
03:29:11,460 --> 03:29:12,160
Yeah, they'll have Cole.

5037
03:29:12,340 --> 03:29:13,340
They'll have all the support.

5038
03:29:13,520 --> 03:29:14,020
I agree.

5039
03:29:17,480 --> 03:29:18,100
He's tired.

5040
03:29:18,320 --> 03:29:18,440
He's tired.

5041
03:29:21,320 --> 03:29:22,200
Go ahead.

5042
03:29:28,020 --> 03:29:28,620
Oh god.

5043
03:29:28,940 --> 03:29:29,720
Not the orb.

5044
03:29:29,960 --> 03:29:30,760
Not the orb.

5045
03:29:30,860 --> 03:29:30,980
No!

5046
03:29:32,900 --> 03:29:33,560
It's fine!

5047
03:29:34,460 --> 03:29:35,340
It's fine!

5048
03:29:37,060 --> 03:29:37,640
Just get him.

5049
03:29:38,260 --> 03:29:38,840
Oh no.

5050
03:29:38,980 --> 03:29:39,740
A blade.

5051
03:29:39,920 --> 03:29:40,320
I'm dead.

5052
03:29:40,460 --> 03:29:40,560
I'm dead.

5053
03:29:40,700 --> 03:29:40,900
Oh!

5054
03:29:41,760 --> 03:29:42,440
Time to get clever.

5055
03:29:43,320 --> 03:29:46,090
I'm here.

5056
03:29:46,550 --> 03:29:47,290
Where is he?

5057
03:29:47,490 --> 03:29:48,130
Enemy here!

5058
03:29:48,730 --> 03:29:49,450
Where is he?

5059
03:29:49,790 --> 03:29:50,190
Oh!

5060
03:29:51,210 --> 03:29:52,290
Enemy coming my way!

5061
03:29:53,530 --> 03:29:54,330
Oh no!

5062
03:29:54,610 --> 03:29:55,330
It's not over!

5063
03:29:55,570 --> 03:29:55,710
Be tuned.

5064
03:29:55,870 --> 03:29:55,970
Be tuned.

5065
03:29:56,070 --> 03:29:56,250
Come here.

5066
03:29:56,350 --> 03:29:56,490
Come here.

5067
03:29:56,810 --> 03:29:58,310
It's actually not over!

5068
03:30:01,650 --> 03:30:02,050
What?!

5069
03:30:02,050 --> 03:30:03,930
That is not over!

5070
03:30:04,510 --> 03:30:04,630
Come.

5071
03:30:04,650 --> 03:30:04,950
Warrior up.

5072
03:30:05,010 --> 03:30:05,410
Warrior up.

5073
03:30:05,410 --> 03:30:05,670
Warrior up.

5074
03:30:05,890 --> 03:30:06,630
Enemy up.

5075
03:30:06,650 --> 03:30:07,070
Warrior up.

5076
03:30:07,450 --> 03:30:08,450
Warrior up.

5077
03:30:09,290 --> 03:30:09,510
Oh god.

5078
03:30:09,650 --> 03:30:10,250
Turn around.

5079
03:30:10,390 --> 03:30:10,630
Turn around.

5080
03:30:10,690 --> 03:30:10,870
Turn around.

5081
03:30:11,710 --> 03:30:14,370
How is he in such a good way?!

5082
03:30:15,710 --> 03:30:16,670
We're going to need soldier men.

5083
03:30:16,850 --> 03:30:17,270
What?!

5084
03:30:17,270 --> 03:30:18,610
Oh my god!

5085
03:30:18,850 --> 03:30:21,350
What the fuck is this game?!

5086
03:30:24,170 --> 03:30:25,630
This is what I mean.

5087
03:30:25,990 --> 03:30:28,130
It's the battle of the counter swaps.

5088
03:30:28,370 --> 03:30:35,110
The battle of the counter swaps.

5089
03:30:35,110 --> 03:30:36,830
What a fucking game.

5090
03:30:37,730 --> 03:30:39,190
Oh my god.

5091
03:30:40,950 --> 03:30:42,270
What a game.

5092
03:30:42,450 --> 03:30:43,670
Okay, that was a good game.

5093
03:30:43,870 --> 03:30:46,810
That was actually a really good game.

5094
03:30:46,950 --> 03:30:48,250
That was insane.

5095
03:30:48,790 --> 03:30:50,270
Holy shit.

5096
03:30:51,370 --> 03:30:52,870
Oh, we deserve that.

5097
03:30:53,050 --> 03:30:55,090
We fucking deserve that so much.

5098
03:30:55,330 --> 03:30:55,790
Like...

5099
03:30:56,610 --> 03:30:58,330
Our tanks were just...

5100
03:30:58,330 --> 03:31:00,150
The tanks were just counter swapping!

5101
03:31:00,370 --> 03:31:01,950
The battle of the counter swaps!

5102
03:31:03,550 --> 03:31:04,570
That was insane.

5103
03:31:06,410 --> 03:31:08,850
I saw so many different tanks today.

5104
03:31:08,850 --> 03:31:10,410
From one game.

5105
03:31:10,550 --> 03:31:11,870
From one game.

5106
03:31:11,970 --> 03:31:13,410
I saw a million tanks.

5107
03:31:15,590 --> 03:31:16,930
I hate learning Alari.

5108
03:31:17,290 --> 03:31:19,270
Maybe I should just play with a support player.

5109
03:31:19,450 --> 03:31:20,470
That plays Alari.

5110
03:31:27,050 --> 03:31:29,870
I thought I was Kirikou for one second.

5111
03:31:30,090 --> 03:31:31,210
That's why I threw him by pylon.

5112
03:31:32,710 --> 03:31:33,950
That shit was ridiculous.

5113
03:31:34,270 --> 03:31:34,430
Yeah.

5114
03:31:34,510 --> 03:31:36,110
He literally went back to zone.

5115
03:31:36,610 --> 03:31:37,250
To point.

5116
03:31:37,250 --> 03:31:38,030
Just to...

5117
03:31:38,030 --> 03:31:40,710
He went back to respawn just to swap.

5118
03:31:41,250 --> 03:31:42,250
That's what I'm saying.

5119
03:31:42,630 --> 03:31:43,530
All these tanks.

5120
03:31:43,630 --> 03:31:44,230
That's all they do.

5121
03:31:45,970 --> 03:31:47,230
The world of tanks.

5122
03:31:53,260 --> 03:31:53,820
No!

5123
03:31:53,820 --> 03:31:54,400
My pylon!

5124
03:31:55,080 --> 03:31:56,220
That's fucked up.

5125
03:32:00,480 --> 03:32:01,040
No!

5126
03:32:02,480 --> 03:32:03,040
Stop!

5127
03:32:07,200 --> 03:32:08,760
Yeah, that shit was ridiculous.

5128
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:09,840
Holy fuck.

5129
03:32:10,680 --> 03:32:12,580
That shit was intense though.

5130
03:32:14,160 --> 03:32:15,700
I was gonna avoid the junk.

5131
03:32:15,700 --> 03:32:17,060
But he clutched it.

5132
03:32:17,300 --> 03:32:19,000
He clutched it when it mattered.

5133
03:32:19,160 --> 03:32:19,540
You know?

5134
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:21,540
What?

5135
03:32:25,000 --> 03:32:26,300
Let me go.

5136
03:32:30,450 --> 03:32:31,370
Oh no.

5137
03:32:35,820 --> 03:32:36,600
That's right.

5138
03:32:36,740 --> 03:32:37,060
No!

5139
03:32:37,260 --> 03:32:37,880
My pylon!

5140
03:32:38,560 --> 03:32:39,620
My baby!

5141
03:32:42,640 --> 03:32:43,260
Please!

5142
03:32:46,020 --> 03:32:46,640
Please!

5143
03:32:46,900 --> 03:32:47,900
Leave me alone!

5144
03:32:48,180 --> 03:32:49,540
I don't have anything!

5145
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:54,240
I'm literally poor!

5146
03:32:56,420 --> 03:32:57,760
I hear junk.

5147
03:33:00,990 --> 03:33:01,990
Oh, he left.

5148
03:33:02,310 --> 03:33:02,870
Yay!

5149
03:33:03,130 --> 03:33:03,910
It's just me.

5150
03:33:06,270 --> 03:33:07,190
Oh my god.

5151
03:33:07,210 --> 03:33:07,690
It's so scary.

5152
03:33:08,630 --> 03:33:09,270
Come on.

5153
03:33:11,830 --> 03:33:12,750
I hear him.

5154
03:33:18,260 --> 03:33:18,980
Don't worry.

5155
03:33:19,220 --> 03:33:20,400
I have my pylon.

5156
03:33:21,420 --> 03:33:21,920
I...

5157
03:33:21,920 --> 03:33:22,640
Yeah!

5158
03:33:23,180 --> 03:33:24,100
I have my pylon.

5159
03:33:24,100 --> 03:33:24,460
I...

5160
03:33:24,460 --> 03:33:26,440
I still have my pylon.

5161
03:33:27,080 --> 03:33:27,660
That's right.

5162
03:33:28,360 --> 03:33:28,800
Tomato.

5163
03:33:29,020 --> 03:33:29,900
I thought it was tomato.

5164
03:33:29,980 --> 03:33:30,840
I was like, oh my god.

5165
03:33:30,960 --> 03:33:31,660
I fight myself.

5166
03:33:32,680 --> 03:33:33,640
Oh, I hear a...

5167
03:33:33,640 --> 03:33:34,600
Oh, that's an ash.

5168
03:33:34,800 --> 03:33:35,480
I thought that was a widow.

5169
03:33:36,180 --> 03:33:38,140
The only issue is just the wait time.

5170
03:33:38,760 --> 03:33:40,620
But like, I understand we need...

5171
03:33:40,620 --> 03:33:41,320
Oh no.

5172
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:42,140
Oh no.

5173
03:33:44,840 --> 03:33:45,280
No!

5174
03:33:46,600 --> 03:33:47,480
My pylon!

5175
03:33:49,800 --> 03:33:51,020
Not my pylon!

5176
03:33:51,400 --> 03:33:51,980
Oh no.

5177
03:33:53,980 --> 03:33:54,420
Oh no.

5178
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:55,520
What?

5179
03:33:56,560 --> 03:33:57,040
Okay.

5180
03:33:57,120 --> 03:33:58,220
I give him that.

5181
03:33:58,700 --> 03:33:59,760
I'm gonna solo alt somebody.

5182
03:34:00,060 --> 03:34:00,720
But not me.

5183
03:34:01,080 --> 03:34:03,200
Because it'll not be worth it.

5184
03:34:03,280 --> 03:34:03,800
Alright, Tomato.

5185
03:34:04,040 --> 03:34:04,920
Where are you?

5186
03:34:05,380 --> 03:34:06,580
Where the fuck are you?

5187
03:34:06,840 --> 03:34:08,100
I'm gonna solo alt you.

5188
03:34:09,240 --> 03:34:10,640
Where are you, Tomato?

5189
03:34:12,500 --> 03:34:13,780
Where the fuck are you?

5190
03:34:14,220 --> 03:34:15,080
Oh my god.

5191
03:34:15,100 --> 03:34:16,300
This is a five stack in here.

5192
03:34:19,280 --> 03:34:20,160
That's fucking right.

5193
03:34:21,820 --> 03:34:22,300
No.

5194
03:34:23,700 --> 03:34:24,180
Yes!

5195
03:34:24,200 --> 03:34:24,400
Yes!

5196
03:34:24,420 --> 03:34:24,520
No!

5197
03:34:24,840 --> 03:34:25,820
He's the only one!

5198
03:34:26,260 --> 03:34:27,520
He's the only one!

5199
03:34:28,600 --> 03:34:32,380
Fuck this.

5200
03:34:34,800 --> 03:34:35,920
I'm done.

5201
03:34:36,220 --> 03:34:37,640
I'm never gonna learn Ilari.

5202
03:34:39,100 --> 03:34:40,240
I'm done.

5203
03:34:43,000 --> 03:34:45,920
Oh, the game was like, you're done too.

5204
03:34:46,420 --> 03:34:50,060
Even the game was like, you're done.

5205
03:34:50,320 --> 03:34:50,980
I'm done.

5206
03:34:52,320 --> 03:34:53,140
I'm done.

5207
03:34:54,380 --> 03:34:54,400
I'm done.

5208
03:34:57,060 --> 03:34:58,260
Alright, let's see.

5209
03:34:58,480 --> 03:34:59,860
Is that girl gonna play Mercy?

5210
03:35:01,320 --> 03:35:03,860
Cause like they have a Mercy icon.

5211
03:35:05,060 --> 03:35:10,060
Is it weird that like every time I see a Mercy icon, I instinctually went Mercy?

5212
03:35:11,260 --> 03:35:13,020
It's not bad, right?

5213
03:35:16,540 --> 03:35:18,240
Oh no, they have Mercy everything!

5214
03:35:21,680 --> 03:35:22,980
Alright, prove me wrong.

5215
03:35:23,800 --> 03:35:25,340
They proved me wrong!

5216
03:35:26,480 --> 03:35:27,960
They're an Ana player!

5217
03:35:28,720 --> 03:35:29,640
Oh my god!

5218
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:32,180
This is why you don't judge a book by its cover, guys.

5219
03:35:32,680 --> 03:35:33,880
This is exactly why.

5220
03:35:34,080 --> 03:35:35,480
Cause I'm gonna play Mercy.

5221
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:48,260
This is why.

5222
03:35:48,660 --> 03:35:50,760
You don't judge a book by its cover, guys!

5223
03:35:55,060 --> 03:35:57,020
I'm gonna play Ana one life and then I'm gonna play Mercy.

5224
03:35:57,340 --> 03:35:59,200
I should have been playing Mercy on this map.

5225
03:35:59,360 --> 03:36:02,440
Mercy is really good at defense on this specific point.

5226
03:36:02,800 --> 03:36:07,220
Cause like, the verticality.

5227
03:36:09,360 --> 03:36:10,920
Oh yeah, I stole their Ana!

5228
03:36:11,300 --> 03:36:13,520
Wait, I shouldn't have played...

5229
03:36:13,940 --> 03:36:14,900
Wait, you're right!

5230
03:36:16,540 --> 03:36:18,260
I stole their one trick!

5231
03:36:18,440 --> 03:36:18,820
Oops!

5232
03:36:21,600 --> 03:36:22,000
Really?

5233
03:36:22,000 --> 03:36:23,300
I was like...

5234
03:36:24,140 --> 03:36:25,520
I'm fucking dead.

5235
03:36:25,780 --> 03:36:28,800
I'm like, I brought... I bring him down with me though.

5236
03:36:29,480 --> 03:36:30,620
Alright, I...

5237
03:36:31,760 --> 03:36:32,360
Oops!

5238
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:38,500
I mean, I like how I said that and I'm like, oh I'm gonna steal their Ana.

5239
03:36:40,520 --> 03:36:42,320
Sorry, that's my bad.

5240
03:36:42,880 --> 03:36:43,480
Oops!

5241
03:36:44,540 --> 03:36:46,020
Accidental throwing, guys.

5242
03:36:49,900 --> 03:36:51,600
Are they not...

5243
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:52,760
Tapping the point?

5244
03:36:54,340 --> 03:36:55,520
You're still here.

5245
03:36:56,480 --> 03:36:57,420
You know what?

5246
03:36:57,560 --> 03:36:57,920
No, fuck.

5247
03:36:57,960 --> 03:36:58,740
This guy needs to learn.

5248
03:36:59,100 --> 03:37:01,380
It can't be a... one trick.

5249
03:37:04,240 --> 03:37:05,720
I need to like...

5250
03:37:10,180 --> 03:37:11,380
I'm fucking

5251
03:37:18,220 --> 03:37:18,780
dead.

5252
03:37:20,740 --> 03:37:21,340
No!

5253
03:37:24,630 --> 03:37:27,990
Why is everybody not playing together?

5254
03:37:28,570 --> 03:37:29,170
Okay.

5255
03:37:29,990 --> 03:37:33,690
I'm throwing because I took away... I took away their Ana.

5256
03:37:37,050 --> 03:37:38,810
That was my bad.

5257
03:37:39,210 --> 03:37:39,770
I'll...

5258
03:37:40,930 --> 03:37:41,210
Yeah.

5259
03:37:42,770 --> 03:37:43,850
Oh, I forgot.

5260
03:37:44,090 --> 03:37:44,370
Whoops.

5261
03:37:44,530 --> 03:37:44,790
Goodbye.

5262
03:37:45,330 --> 03:37:46,430
Are you on a roller right now?

5263
03:37:47,170 --> 03:37:47,730
No!

5264
03:37:48,570 --> 03:37:50,930
I wanted to punch the stop sign away!

5265
03:37:55,120 --> 03:37:58,080
Yeah, that's not that big of a deal for me.

5266
03:37:58,500 --> 03:37:59,060
No!

5267
03:38:01,440 --> 03:38:02,760
I was playing as me.

5268
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:05,700
I just wanna use the nano and then I'll...

5269
03:38:05,700 --> 03:38:06,300
I swear!

5270
03:38:06,700 --> 03:38:08,440
I'm not even doing a lot of healings.

5271
03:38:10,760 --> 03:38:11,860
I'll just swap.

5272
03:38:12,040 --> 03:38:13,880
I'm sorry, Juggs!

5273
03:38:14,440 --> 03:38:15,380
I'm sorry.

5274
03:38:15,640 --> 03:38:17,640
I'll just be a Qirka one trick.

5275
03:38:18,220 --> 03:38:19,940
There is also a Genji up here.

5276
03:38:20,460 --> 03:38:20,960
Yeah.

5277
03:38:21,280 --> 03:38:21,880
No brawl.

5278
03:38:21,880 --> 03:38:22,560
Give me a hero.

5279
03:38:23,380 --> 03:38:24,480
Are they okay?

5280
03:38:26,960 --> 03:38:27,680
Oh, wait.

5281
03:38:27,680 --> 03:38:29,200
Why would you charge him?

5282
03:38:29,420 --> 03:38:31,100
He's one.

5283
03:38:31,200 --> 03:38:31,980
He's literally one.

5284
03:38:33,800 --> 03:38:34,740
He's still one.

5285
03:38:34,760 --> 03:38:35,200
I'm not kidding.

5286
03:38:39,480 --> 03:38:40,060
What?

5287
03:38:40,480 --> 03:38:42,340
My ult didn't go off!

5288
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:43,740
I was so confused.

5289
03:38:43,880 --> 03:38:44,820
I did the whole animation twice.

5290
03:38:47,700 --> 03:38:48,760
Are you serious?

5291
03:38:49,100 --> 03:38:50,220
Okay, JK.

5292
03:38:50,520 --> 03:38:51,100
Sorry.

5293
03:38:51,200 --> 03:38:51,860
That was embarrassing.

5294
03:38:52,440 --> 03:38:53,820
That was actually embarrassing.

5295
03:38:57,280 --> 03:38:58,380
I hit it!

5296
03:38:58,480 --> 03:38:59,520
But he's dead anyway!

5297
03:39:06,770 --> 03:39:07,790
I'm throwing.

5298
03:39:08,090 --> 03:39:09,190
I'm actually throwing.

5299
03:39:10,190 --> 03:39:11,330
I'm throwing.

5300
03:39:11,790 --> 03:39:13,990
I don't wanna play Ana anymore.

5301
03:39:17,230 --> 03:39:20,690
I don't wanna play Ana anymore.

5302
03:39:20,930 --> 03:39:21,930
I'm sorry.

5303
03:39:22,190 --> 03:39:22,950
I was throwing.

5304
03:39:23,170 --> 03:39:24,330
It's my fault.

5305
03:39:24,450 --> 03:39:26,470
I will admit...

5306
03:39:26,470 --> 03:39:28,210
I threw this entire game.

5307
03:39:28,930 --> 03:39:30,870
I will admit that.

5308
03:39:31,050 --> 03:39:34,330
I take 100% responsibility.

5309
03:39:35,290 --> 03:39:36,050
I'm sorry.

5310
03:39:41,430 --> 03:39:42,710
Oh, shit.

5311
03:39:43,310 --> 03:39:46,510
But, even when I swap, guys...

5312
03:39:47,470 --> 03:39:48,810
I don't know.

5313
03:39:51,950 --> 03:39:54,270
Guys, I think it's just a team issue.

5314
03:39:54,630 --> 03:39:56,450
It's not just me, guys.

5315
03:39:56,930 --> 03:39:59,390
I don't think it's just me, guys.

5316
03:40:00,390 --> 03:40:01,790
I definitely agree.

5317
03:40:01,970 --> 03:40:03,230
Thank you.

5318
03:40:07,050 --> 03:40:08,750
It's okay, we have next game.

5319
03:40:08,910 --> 03:40:10,450
I know when I'm throwing.

5320
03:40:10,610 --> 03:40:13,930
Guys, I think I should have went Mercy.

5321
03:40:14,830 --> 03:40:17,230
I'm gonna go Mercy during the attack.

5322
03:40:19,750 --> 03:40:22,830
Holy shit, we're getting absolutely destroyed.

5323
03:40:23,290 --> 03:40:23,790
Jesus.

5324
03:40:26,090 --> 03:40:28,630
Oh, he fucking was not there.

5325
03:40:28,950 --> 03:40:31,730
I thought he'd be there earlier.

5326
03:40:34,910 --> 03:40:36,530
Junk is still one, guys.

5327
03:40:37,370 --> 03:40:39,190
Junk is not one anymore.

5328
03:40:39,610 --> 03:40:40,930
It's okay, I'm here.

5329
03:40:41,550 --> 03:40:42,470
I'm here.

5330
03:40:43,650 --> 03:40:45,010
Guys, no.

5331
03:40:46,530 --> 03:40:48,070
Oh my god.

5332
03:40:51,710 --> 03:40:57,910
I would admit, I threw the first point in the second point.

5333
03:40:58,110 --> 03:41:01,710
I threw the first point in the second point.

5334
03:41:01,730 --> 03:41:07,030
I don't know, I forgot that he's an Ana main and I took Ana from him.

5335
03:41:07,150 --> 03:41:08,610
Oh my god.

5336
03:41:09,210 --> 03:41:09,850
Whoops.

5337
03:41:14,250 --> 03:41:15,990
I'll be on Mercy duty.

5338
03:41:17,030 --> 03:41:18,450
Are you up or are you down?

5339
03:41:19,970 --> 03:41:21,250
I'm very down.

5340
03:41:22,710 --> 03:41:24,610
Wait, who said that?

5341
03:41:24,890 --> 03:41:26,830
Bastion is three to Bastion is five.

5342
03:41:27,790 --> 03:41:29,290
There you go, okay.

5343
03:41:29,470 --> 03:41:30,770
I'm avoiding him.

5344
03:41:30,930 --> 03:41:31,130
Yeah.

5345
03:41:31,730 --> 03:41:33,630
Like in one session or like...

5346
03:41:33,630 --> 03:41:33,910
Yeah.

5347
03:41:35,390 --> 03:41:36,990
Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.

5348
03:41:36,990 --> 03:41:38,070
Guys, I don't think it's me.

5349
03:41:39,570 --> 03:41:41,290
We were up at first.

5350
03:41:43,010 --> 03:41:44,390
Guys, I don't think it's me.

5351
03:41:44,750 --> 03:41:45,150
I know.

5352
03:41:46,870 --> 03:41:48,230
You went from... How?

5353
03:41:51,390 --> 03:41:53,050
Did you guys hear what he said?

5354
03:41:53,890 --> 03:41:54,490
Five, huh?

5355
03:41:54,830 --> 03:41:56,170
Yeah, but then we lost the other one.

5356
03:41:56,190 --> 03:41:57,170
You guys heard it, right?

5357
03:41:59,370 --> 03:41:59,770
Yeah.

5358
03:41:59,770 --> 03:42:00,710
One more, one more.

5359
03:42:04,530 --> 03:42:06,410
Did you hear what he said?

5360
03:42:06,670 --> 03:42:07,230
Oh!

5361
03:42:08,530 --> 03:42:11,810
Master, he went from Master's three to Master's five.

5362
03:42:13,750 --> 03:42:14,950
Okay, don't worry.

5363
03:42:15,870 --> 03:42:16,850
Don't worry.

5364
03:42:20,450 --> 03:42:21,010
Okay.

5365
03:42:21,870 --> 03:42:23,150
Oh my god!

5366
03:42:24,570 --> 03:42:28,990
He said he went from Master's three to Master's five in one session, guys.

5367
03:42:29,190 --> 03:42:29,750
I'm out.

5368
03:42:29,750 --> 03:42:30,590
That's what he said!

5369
03:42:31,450 --> 03:42:35,150
He's been playing and he went down two ranks!

5370
03:42:38,470 --> 03:42:40,070
Literally two ranks!

5371
03:42:41,450 --> 03:42:43,010
This team is cooked.

5372
03:42:44,610 --> 03:42:47,210
This team is actually fully cooked, guys.

5373
03:42:49,350 --> 03:42:50,790
Oh no...

5374
03:42:54,490 --> 03:42:55,210
Oh!

5375
03:42:56,910 --> 03:42:58,670
Is our Ashe gonna be okay?

5376
03:43:00,510 --> 03:43:03,210
Oh, our Genji is not gonna be okay.

5377
03:43:05,850 --> 03:43:07,190
Oh please!

5378
03:43:07,450 --> 03:43:08,830
I needed help too!

5379
03:43:10,290 --> 03:43:12,910
I was getting shot by five different people!

5380
03:43:13,530 --> 03:43:14,750
Okay, let me...

5381
03:43:14,750 --> 03:43:17,170
Let me see...

5382
03:43:20,450 --> 03:43:21,590
There's no...

5383
03:43:22,550 --> 03:43:24,750
Wait, what's the voice chat volume?

5384
03:43:27,230 --> 03:43:28,650
Where's the voice chat volume?

5385
03:43:28,670 --> 03:43:29,930
I can't find it!

5386
03:43:30,910 --> 03:43:32,190
Bro needs to stop.

5387
03:43:32,310 --> 03:43:32,930
Dude, he does.

5388
03:43:33,390 --> 03:43:34,710
This guy needs to stop.

5389
03:43:34,790 --> 03:43:37,470
This is not Top 500 easy anymore for this man.

5390
03:43:37,830 --> 03:43:40,910
He is getting doom dipped hard.

5391
03:43:44,970 --> 03:43:46,090
Oh, god.

5392
03:43:48,550 --> 03:43:51,070
I don't even know if I could rez him!

5393
03:43:51,330 --> 03:43:52,950
I don't know!

5394
03:43:55,550 --> 03:43:56,970
Oh my god!

5395
03:43:56,970 --> 03:43:57,210
Oh, god.

5396
03:43:57,210 --> 03:43:59,570
I tried to scrape away, so...

5397
03:44:00,090 --> 03:44:00,570
Goodbye!

5398
03:44:02,790 --> 03:44:03,750
Oh, goodbye!

5399
03:44:04,710 --> 03:44:05,190
Woah!

5400
03:44:06,090 --> 03:44:06,570
Please!

5401
03:44:07,990 --> 03:44:09,150
He chased me!

5402
03:44:12,710 --> 03:44:13,350
Oh, yup.

5403
03:44:13,430 --> 03:44:14,570
You can search it in the settings?

5404
03:44:14,890 --> 03:44:16,030
Wait, you can search?

5405
03:44:17,330 --> 03:44:17,810
Okay.

5406
03:44:18,230 --> 03:44:18,710
Alright.

5407
03:44:18,930 --> 03:44:21,050
No, this is just GG, it doesn't matter.

5408
03:44:21,170 --> 03:44:22,110
This whole team is fucked.

5409
03:44:22,850 --> 03:44:24,130
Sorry, I avoid...

5410
03:44:24,130 --> 03:44:26,010
We might be able to farm this one guy.

5411
03:44:26,010 --> 03:44:28,970
We might be able to farm him.

5412
03:44:29,150 --> 03:44:29,350
Let's...

5413
03:44:30,010 --> 03:44:30,350
Okay.

5414
03:44:31,150 --> 03:44:31,430
Um...

5415
03:44:32,050 --> 03:44:32,610
Okay!

5416
03:44:32,970 --> 03:44:34,150
I think this team is...

5417
03:44:34,150 --> 03:44:35,210
We're all special!

5418
03:44:35,490 --> 03:44:36,550
It's not just me!

5419
03:44:36,810 --> 03:44:38,050
I admit I threw!

5420
03:44:38,330 --> 03:44:39,410
But it's not just me!

5421
03:44:44,370 --> 03:44:45,490
I admit!

5422
03:44:47,010 --> 03:44:49,530
But it's definitely not just me!

5423
03:44:52,720 --> 03:44:53,280
Okay.

5424
03:44:57,820 --> 03:44:58,420
Yeah.

5425
03:44:59,700 --> 03:45:00,820
Yeah, we did it!

5426
03:45:00,880 --> 03:45:01,880
We finally killed Doom!

5427
03:45:02,640 --> 03:45:03,940
We fucking did it!

5428
03:45:07,860 --> 03:45:09,040
We did it, guys!

5429
03:45:09,800 --> 03:45:10,960
We made it!

5430
03:45:14,700 --> 03:45:15,160
Whoa.

5431
03:45:16,260 --> 03:45:17,200
Oh, shit!

5432
03:45:17,600 --> 03:45:19,420
Please, somebody kill this Junkrat!

5433
03:45:23,820 --> 03:45:24,420
Somebody...

5434
03:45:24,420 --> 03:45:26,600
Somebody, please let me...

5435
03:45:26,600 --> 03:45:27,960
Somebody, please!

5436
03:45:29,800 --> 03:45:30,600
He's dead, he is dead!

5437
03:45:30,680 --> 03:45:31,160
He is dead.

5438
03:45:31,160 --> 03:45:31,600
Don't worry.

5439
03:45:31,700 --> 03:45:33,360
I will ult when we need it.

5440
03:45:33,440 --> 03:45:33,800
When we...

5441
03:45:33,800 --> 03:45:34,840
When we need it.

5442
03:45:35,180 --> 03:45:36,520
Back, back, back, back!

5443
03:45:37,200 --> 03:45:37,680
Back!

5444
03:45:37,860 --> 03:45:38,340
Back!

5445
03:45:38,580 --> 03:45:39,060
Back!

5446
03:45:39,060 --> 03:45:40,600
Oh, okay.

5447
03:45:42,400 --> 03:45:42,880
Sleep beg!

5448
03:45:48,810 --> 03:45:49,290
Alright.

5449
03:45:50,630 --> 03:45:51,590
Oh, okay.

5450
03:45:54,310 --> 03:45:54,790
Oh!

5451
03:45:59,100 --> 03:46:00,200
Goodbye, everybody!

5452
03:46:00,600 --> 03:46:01,140
Get out of our seat.

5453
03:46:02,140 --> 03:46:02,840
I'm trying.

5454
03:46:02,900 --> 03:46:04,620
NOOOOO I HIT IT!

5455
03:46:04,900 --> 03:46:08,240
Oh my god!

5456
03:46:13,440 --> 03:46:15,340
I did my job.

5457
03:46:16,060 --> 03:46:17,860
I did what I needed to do.

5458
03:46:18,040 --> 03:46:21,660
This entire team was just not workable.

5459
03:46:21,840 --> 03:46:23,100
You can't do that anymore!

5460
03:46:28,050 --> 03:46:31,190
This entire team was a mess.

5461
03:46:31,190 --> 03:46:34,650
I would admit, I was also a mess.

5462
03:46:34,890 --> 03:46:36,490
But it was a group effort.

5463
03:46:36,830 --> 03:46:37,570
It was...

5464
03:46:45,450 --> 03:46:49,410
It was a group effort of disaster right there.

5465
03:46:49,730 --> 03:46:52,730
It was actually... it was not just me.

5466
03:46:52,930 --> 03:46:55,070
My entire team was just a mess.

5467
03:46:58,880 --> 03:47:01,260
A mess of group effort.

5468
03:47:01,800 --> 03:47:02,820
We all...

5469
03:47:03,360 --> 03:47:05,460
We all did not deserve to win that.

5470
03:47:05,920 --> 03:47:08,740
I mean the moment I heard this Doom player went...

5471
03:47:08,740 --> 03:47:10,920
Yeah, I went from Master 3 to Master 5.

5472
03:47:12,540 --> 03:47:14,220
Master 3 to Master 5.

5473
03:47:14,500 --> 03:47:16,460
And the other guy was like, in one session?

5474
03:47:16,980 --> 03:47:18,120
And I knew...

5475
03:47:18,560 --> 03:47:21,460
The moment he said that, I knew it was over.

5476
03:47:21,840 --> 03:47:23,020
I knew it!

5477
03:47:28,620 --> 03:47:29,660
Oh hey, it's him!

5478
03:47:31,480 --> 03:47:31,960
Alright.

5479
03:47:32,140 --> 03:47:32,800
Please don't...

5480
03:47:32,800 --> 03:47:34,320
Please don't make me be the one to break his win streak.

5481
03:47:36,320 --> 03:47:38,840
If I break this man's win...

5482
03:47:38,840 --> 03:47:39,420
Like if I...

5483
03:47:39,420 --> 03:47:39,640
I'm sorry.

5484
03:47:39,740 --> 03:47:41,460
If I break this man's loss streak...

5485
03:47:41,920 --> 03:47:43,320
That's the last game for me.

5486
03:47:43,960 --> 03:47:44,740
That's the...

5487
03:47:48,180 --> 03:47:49,440
That's my last game.

5488
03:47:50,660 --> 03:47:51,940
Okay, no he plays Doom.

5489
03:47:52,760 --> 03:47:54,300
I'm gonna go Kiriko if he plays Doom.

5490
03:47:55,440 --> 03:47:56,320
Oh, Hammond.

5491
03:47:56,780 --> 03:47:58,620
I don't wanna play Ana if he's playing Doom.

5492
03:48:00,180 --> 03:48:01,180
I'll play Kiriko.

5493
03:48:01,220 --> 03:48:02,260
Yo, what works well with me?

5494
03:48:02,260 --> 03:48:02,800
I'll play my own path.

5495
03:48:04,700 --> 03:48:05,900
That actually works great.

5496
03:48:06,300 --> 03:48:06,920
Okay, good.

5497
03:48:08,380 --> 03:48:08,860
Alright.

5498
03:48:11,320 --> 03:48:12,320
I'll run Kiriko.

5499
03:48:12,480 --> 03:48:13,200
I don't wanna play...

5500
03:48:13,200 --> 03:48:15,020
I don't wanna play Ana against a Doom.

5501
03:48:15,180 --> 03:48:16,020
It's just not fun.

5502
03:48:18,180 --> 03:48:21,300
Kiriko's the only fun character to play against Doom players.

5503
03:48:23,940 --> 03:48:27,540
If I make this man lose his loss streak, it's over for me.

5504
03:48:27,680 --> 03:48:29,000
I'm fucking done for the day.

5505
03:48:29,340 --> 03:48:30,980
I'm so done for the day.

5506
03:48:35,600 --> 03:48:36,040
I'm so done for the day.

5507
03:48:36,040 --> 03:48:37,360
That's when I know it's just...

5508
03:48:37,360 --> 03:48:38,720
Today's just over.

5509
03:48:46,850 --> 03:48:48,150
Come on, kill him!

5510
03:48:48,210 --> 03:48:48,730
He's solo!

5511
03:48:49,370 --> 03:48:49,810
Yes.

5512
03:48:50,310 --> 03:48:50,950
Thank god.

5513
03:48:51,290 --> 03:48:52,970
Please, let me just farm him.

5514
03:48:53,190 --> 03:48:54,150
Let me...

5515
03:48:57,410 --> 03:48:58,070
There you go.

5516
03:48:58,110 --> 03:48:59,490
I can clean... I can touch the spot here.

5517
03:48:59,910 --> 03:49:01,930
There you go.

5518
03:49:01,930 --> 03:49:01,930
I can clean...

5519
03:49:01,930 --> 03:49:01,930
I can touch the spot here.

5520
03:49:01,930 --> 03:49:02,870
Oh, Hammond.

5521
03:49:02,870 --> 03:49:03,630
Hammond.

5522
03:49:04,730 --> 03:49:05,370
Hammond.

5523
03:49:06,450 --> 03:49:07,090
Hammond!

5524
03:49:07,690 --> 03:49:08,970
No, Hammond!

5525
03:49:09,550 --> 03:49:11,710
Alright, this is a little worrying now.

5526
03:49:15,270 --> 03:49:16,230
Oh no.

5527
03:49:18,530 --> 03:49:19,810
I'm sorry, man.

5528
03:49:20,570 --> 03:49:21,590
I'm sorry, man.

5529
03:49:23,920 --> 03:49:24,640
I'm sorry, man.

5530
03:49:24,640 --> 03:49:24,940
Alright.

5531
03:49:25,820 --> 03:49:27,240
We can't really touch.

5532
03:49:27,500 --> 03:49:29,740
But we're trying so hard to keep you alive!

5533
03:49:31,220 --> 03:49:32,820
We're trying so hard!

5534
03:49:33,480 --> 03:49:33,960
We're trying so hard!

5535
03:49:34,600 --> 03:49:35,800
Oh, he fucked up!

5536
03:49:36,020 --> 03:49:37,440
Oh, but... He's one!

5537
03:49:37,540 --> 03:49:38,200
He's the only one!

5538
03:49:39,080 --> 03:49:40,020
I think he's low.

5539
03:49:40,320 --> 03:49:41,780
God, he's so low.

5540
03:49:43,700 --> 03:49:44,960
Oh, it doesn't matter.

5541
03:49:45,020 --> 03:49:45,940
He's not low anymore.

5542
03:49:46,240 --> 03:49:47,640
It doesn't matter.

5543
03:49:47,840 --> 03:49:48,140
Woo!

5544
03:49:50,100 --> 03:49:50,880
I live.

5545
03:49:52,960 --> 03:49:53,720
I live.

5546
03:49:54,800 --> 03:49:57,200
Guys, I think this Doom is really bad.

5547
03:49:58,700 --> 03:50:02,920
Even if we lose, this Doom is not a good Doom player.

5548
03:50:02,920 --> 03:50:03,900
I think...

5549
03:50:03,900 --> 03:50:08,680
I think this Doom is actually pretty fucking terrible.

5550
03:50:09,140 --> 03:50:13,260
Like, not gonna lie, he is not a good Doom player.

5551
03:50:14,580 --> 03:50:15,840
Oh, okay.

5552
03:50:16,880 --> 03:50:18,120
Like, you...

5553
03:50:18,740 --> 03:50:19,720
It's so...

5554
03:50:19,720 --> 03:50:22,340
It's so noticeable, too.

5555
03:50:23,040 --> 03:50:25,080
It's actually so noticeable.

5556
03:50:26,600 --> 03:50:28,220
Mario literally won.

5557
03:50:28,860 --> 03:50:30,620
It's really noticeable.

5558
03:50:30,620 --> 03:50:31,780
Yeah.

5559
03:50:33,860 --> 03:50:34,940
I played...

5560
03:50:35,300 --> 03:50:37,120
The fact that I played against an ac...

5561
03:50:37,120 --> 03:50:39,300
I played against, like, several good Doom players already.

5562
03:50:43,500 --> 03:50:44,920
No, 100%.

5563
03:50:44,920 --> 03:50:45,360
This...

5564
03:50:46,120 --> 03:50:47,880
That's a little embarrassing, that...

5565
03:50:47,880 --> 03:50:48,700
He fucking...

5566
03:50:49,680 --> 03:50:50,180
Woo!

5567
03:50:50,820 --> 03:50:51,360
Hehehe.

5568
03:50:52,180 --> 03:50:52,900
Hehehe.

5569
03:50:54,160 --> 03:50:54,880
Woo!

5570
03:50:56,620 --> 03:50:57,340
Hehehe.

5571
03:50:58,460 --> 03:50:59,180
Hehehe.

5572
03:51:00,260 --> 03:51:00,980
Hehehe.

5573
03:51:02,560 --> 03:51:03,280
Hehehe.

5574
03:51:04,440 --> 03:51:05,320
Hehehe.

5575
03:51:08,420 --> 03:51:09,300
Hehehe.

5576
03:51:09,540 --> 03:51:10,540
Oh, there is Doom.

5577
03:51:13,280 --> 03:51:14,160
Hehehe.

5578
03:51:16,100 --> 03:51:16,540
Hehehe.

5579
03:51:17,560 --> 03:51:18,000
Hehehe.

5580
03:51:20,560 --> 03:51:21,440
Hehehe.

5581
03:51:21,860 --> 03:51:22,220
Woo!

5582
03:51:23,780 --> 03:51:25,160
You missed one.

5583
03:51:26,060 --> 03:51:27,820
Oh, thank you.

5584
03:51:28,520 --> 03:51:29,400
Hehehe.

5585
03:51:29,960 --> 03:51:30,360
Woo!

5586
03:51:32,380 --> 03:51:33,260
Hehehe.

5587
03:51:35,800 --> 03:51:36,240
Woo!

5588
03:51:38,520 --> 03:51:38,960
Woo!

5589
03:51:41,380 --> 03:51:41,820
Woo!

5590
03:51:42,060 --> 03:51:42,500
Woo!

5591
03:51:43,600 --> 03:51:44,440
I'm still alive.

5592
03:51:44,660 --> 03:51:45,920
I... I fucking... I don't know, man.

5593
03:51:46,940 --> 03:51:47,580
It's fine.

5594
03:51:51,670 --> 03:51:52,650
Oh my god.

5595
03:51:52,710 --> 03:51:52,890
Alright.

5596
03:51:53,810 --> 03:51:54,970
We need to kill this Mercy.

5597
03:51:55,430 --> 03:51:57,030
We really need to kill...

5598
03:51:57,790 --> 03:51:58,750
Alright, here we go.

5599
03:52:01,370 --> 03:52:03,290
Alright, I need to stop fucking running from you.

5600
03:52:03,990 --> 03:52:05,550
I... I was trying to stay alive.

5601
03:52:05,870 --> 03:52:07,010
I was trying to stay alive for the longest time.

5602
03:52:07,130 --> 03:52:07,530
Okay, nice.

5603
03:52:07,550 --> 03:52:08,050
We got the Mercy.

5604
03:52:11,630 --> 03:52:13,270
Bro, he's so low!

5605
03:52:16,870 --> 03:52:17,610
Oh no.

5606
03:52:17,790 --> 03:52:18,310
No!

5607
03:52:18,690 --> 03:52:19,810
Okay, we have one fight.

5608
03:52:21,270 --> 03:52:23,510
No, but their Doom is not good.

5609
03:52:23,750 --> 03:52:26,490
The Doom is literally getting carried by his DPS.

5610
03:52:26,810 --> 03:52:28,270
His DPS is good.

5611
03:52:28,570 --> 03:52:29,090
But...

5612
03:52:29,090 --> 03:52:31,830
His DPS is good, but...

5613
03:52:31,830 --> 03:52:34,150
The Doom is so bad.

5614
03:52:34,590 --> 03:52:35,110
Like...

5615
03:52:35,870 --> 03:52:37,730
It's actually fucking terrible.

5616
03:52:38,290 --> 03:52:40,030
Oh my god.

5617
03:52:43,130 --> 03:52:43,910
Actually...

5618
03:52:43,910 --> 03:52:44,670
Terrible.

5619
03:52:45,770 --> 03:52:46,810
Oh no.

5620
03:52:48,250 --> 03:52:49,030
No!

5621
03:52:49,810 --> 03:52:51,630
That's so unlucky for him.

5622
03:52:54,430 --> 03:52:56,090
I still got it off.

5623
03:52:56,930 --> 03:52:57,710
Okay.

5624
03:53:01,700 --> 03:53:02,700
Come on.

5625
03:53:02,960 --> 03:53:04,060
Come on, Mei!

5626
03:53:04,620 --> 03:53:05,820
Come on, Mei!

5627
03:53:07,960 --> 03:53:08,880
Come on!

5628
03:53:09,100 --> 03:53:10,120
Come on!

5629
03:53:10,120 --> 03:53:11,700
I can't do anything right now.

5630
03:53:11,980 --> 03:53:13,680
I can't do anything right now.

5631
03:53:13,920 --> 03:53:14,900
Keep fighting.

5632
03:53:15,400 --> 03:53:17,840
You're literally getting hard carried by DPS.

5633
03:53:18,320 --> 03:53:18,460
You're literally getting hard carried by DPS.

5634
03:53:24,450 --> 03:53:25,710
I need to keep...

5635
03:53:25,710 --> 03:53:27,110
Nice, okay.

5636
03:53:28,710 --> 03:53:29,390
Nice.

5637
03:53:31,090 --> 03:53:31,770
Nice!

5638
03:53:32,250 --> 03:53:33,570
Holy shit.

5639
03:53:36,690 --> 03:53:38,150
No one's even...

5640
03:53:38,150 --> 03:53:38,390
Yeah.

5641
03:53:38,410 --> 03:53:41,310
Literally, he's getting carried by DPS and support.

5642
03:53:41,730 --> 03:53:42,750
But, yeah.

5643
03:53:48,250 --> 03:53:50,070
Oh my god.

5644
03:53:50,150 --> 03:53:50,470
Bro.

5645
03:53:50,690 --> 03:53:52,350
Their tank, man.

5646
03:53:52,630 --> 03:53:53,770
Their tank.

5647
03:53:54,130 --> 03:53:54,910
Their tank.

5648
03:53:55,050 --> 03:53:58,170
I wanna farm this tank so badly.

5649
03:54:01,830 --> 03:54:06,570
I wanna farm this tank so badly.

5650
03:54:06,750 --> 03:54:07,770
I wanna farm this tank so badly.

5651
03:54:07,770 --> 03:54:07,970
Fuck.

5652
03:54:13,490 --> 03:54:17,190
I now understand how he dropped from Master 3 to 5.

5653
03:54:17,430 --> 03:54:18,810
I understand now.

5654
03:54:19,430 --> 03:54:19,950
It's...

5655
03:54:22,730 --> 03:54:23,770
Holy shit!

5656
03:54:24,130 --> 03:54:25,910
I think that's like the worst tank...

5657
03:54:25,910 --> 03:54:27,750
Worst Doom I've ever seen in this elo.

5658
03:54:28,390 --> 03:54:28,910
100%.

5659
03:54:28,910 --> 03:54:30,970
I've never seen a Doom that bad in this elo.

5660
03:54:31,250 --> 03:54:33,130
I think he... He has to be learning!

5661
03:54:33,410 --> 03:54:35,670
There's no... I refuse to believe.

5662
03:54:36,170 --> 03:54:36,910
Oh my god.

5663
03:54:36,930 --> 03:54:37,390
Thank god.

5664
03:54:37,770 --> 03:54:39,910
He finally... He needed to swap.

5665
03:54:40,150 --> 03:54:42,750
He 100% needed to swap Doom.

5666
03:54:42,930 --> 03:54:44,130
He needed...

5667
03:54:44,130 --> 03:54:45,590
He could not be playing that character.

5668
03:54:45,870 --> 03:54:46,350
He...

5669
03:54:48,410 --> 03:54:51,170
He should not be playing that character.

5670
03:54:52,390 --> 03:54:52,950
100%.

5671
03:54:54,670 --> 03:54:55,230
100%.

5672
03:54:55,230 --> 03:54:56,150
Jesus Christ.

5673
03:54:57,510 --> 03:54:58,070
Oh.

5674
03:54:59,770 --> 03:55:00,810
Oh my god.

5675
03:55:00,830 --> 03:55:02,910
I can't heal the fucking Hammond.

5676
03:55:03,150 --> 03:55:03,250
Oh my god.

5677
03:55:03,250 --> 03:55:03,250
I can't heal the fucking Hammond.

5678
03:55:04,770 --> 03:55:06,010
They're just like...

5679
03:55:06,010 --> 03:55:07,750
We don't have our Hammond to help us.

5680
03:55:07,770 --> 03:55:07,970
We don't have our Hammond to help us.

5681
03:55:11,010 --> 03:55:11,590
Okay.

5682
03:55:12,850 --> 03:55:13,690
Come on.

5683
03:55:13,690 --> 03:55:14,410
Come on Hammond!

5684
03:55:15,550 --> 03:55:16,750
Come on Hammond!

5685
03:55:16,930 --> 03:55:19,310
I'm trying to save you!

5686
03:55:21,270 --> 03:55:22,730
We gotta pick guys!

5687
03:55:23,230 --> 03:55:24,550
We gotta pick guys!

5688
03:55:24,550 --> 03:55:24,970
Somebody push!

5689
03:55:26,590 --> 03:55:27,750
Somebody push!

5690
03:55:27,750 --> 03:55:28,970
Fuck you.

5691
03:55:30,450 --> 03:55:31,030
Oh.

5692
03:55:31,090 --> 03:55:31,670
Alright.

5693
03:55:32,350 --> 03:55:33,130
There we go.

5694
03:55:33,270 --> 03:55:34,150
They got like 30.

5695
03:55:36,250 --> 03:55:36,950
You know.

5696
03:55:37,070 --> 03:55:37,750
That's good though.

5697
03:55:37,770 --> 03:55:38,230
I'm glad he swapped.

5698
03:55:38,470 --> 03:55:38,870
Like...

5699
03:55:38,870 --> 03:55:39,870
It was just embarrassing.

5700
03:55:40,270 --> 03:55:40,890
You know?

5701
03:55:42,670 --> 03:55:43,630
It was just...

5702
03:55:43,630 --> 03:55:44,530
It was just embarrassing.

5703
03:55:45,990 --> 03:55:47,270
Like... He needed to swap.

5704
03:55:47,990 --> 03:55:48,710
He was...

5705
03:55:49,410 --> 03:55:49,910
He...

5706
03:55:49,910 --> 03:55:52,170
He 100% needed to swap.

5707
03:55:53,670 --> 03:55:55,810
This Kiriko is so scared for some reason.

5708
03:55:56,290 --> 03:55:56,890
Not Kiriko.

5709
03:55:56,990 --> 03:55:57,250
Tracer.

5710
03:55:58,170 --> 03:55:58,670
Shit.

5711
03:55:58,750 --> 03:55:59,030
Okay.

5712
03:55:59,170 --> 03:55:59,710
I'm scared.

5713
03:56:01,910 --> 03:56:02,810
Oh Tracer won.

5714
03:56:02,990 --> 03:56:03,230
No.

5715
03:56:03,290 --> 03:56:03,850
I'm scared.

5716
03:56:03,990 --> 03:56:04,470
Oh!

5717
03:56:05,050 --> 03:56:05,530
Oh!

5718
03:56:09,370 --> 03:56:09,850
Fuck.

5719
03:56:09,970 --> 03:56:10,410
Okay.

5720
03:56:11,030 --> 03:56:11,510
Oh.

5721
03:56:11,530 --> 03:56:11,950
Wait.

5722
03:56:12,170 --> 03:56:12,250
No.

5723
03:56:12,290 --> 03:56:13,330
I should... I should stay.

5724
03:56:13,470 --> 03:56:14,210
Because of my ult.

5725
03:56:14,490 --> 03:56:15,170
I should...

5726
03:56:16,030 --> 03:56:18,690
Where the fuck did he come from?

5727
03:56:19,110 --> 03:56:21,510
Where the fuck did he come from?

5728
03:56:23,010 --> 03:56:23,810
Oh my god.

5729
03:56:23,850 --> 03:56:24,590
I wasn't ready for that.

5730
03:56:27,750 --> 03:56:28,230
Wait.

5731
03:56:28,310 --> 03:56:28,550
What?

5732
03:56:38,480 --> 03:56:39,900
Missed the grapple though.

5733
03:56:46,880 --> 03:56:47,180
Oh no.

5734
03:56:50,880 --> 03:56:51,280
No!

5735
03:56:51,680 --> 03:56:52,960
I timed it incorrectly.

5736
03:56:53,860 --> 03:56:54,800
That was my bad.

5737
03:56:55,480 --> 03:56:56,740
I timed it incorrectly.

5738
03:56:57,740 --> 03:56:58,820
Oh my god.

5739
03:56:58,880 --> 03:56:59,920
I timed my E.

5740
03:57:00,340 --> 03:57:01,520
I was like, oh I should E.

5741
03:57:01,620 --> 03:57:02,260
But then I'm like, nope.

5742
03:57:02,280 --> 03:57:03,140
But I got greedy.

5743
03:57:03,340 --> 03:57:04,140
I got so greedy.

5744
03:57:06,320 --> 03:57:08,160
I'm just glad he's not playing Doom anymore.

5745
03:57:08,360 --> 03:57:09,320
Holy shit.

5746
03:57:09,980 --> 03:57:10,380
Yeah.

5747
03:57:10,400 --> 03:57:11,100
I waited too long.

5748
03:57:12,600 --> 03:57:14,120
I was so supr... Oh wait.

5749
03:57:14,180 --> 03:57:14,580
He went on.

5750
03:57:14,660 --> 03:57:14,860
Okay.

5751
03:57:16,140 --> 03:57:17,520
I'll go Zen then.

5752
03:57:17,680 --> 03:57:17,700
I'll go Zen then.

5753
03:57:21,850 --> 03:57:22,530
Alright.

5754
03:57:22,650 --> 03:57:23,110
It's time.

5755
03:57:23,630 --> 03:57:24,650
It's time.

5756
03:57:25,850 --> 03:57:27,150
It's... it's time?

5757
03:57:28,970 --> 03:57:29,930
It's time?

5758
03:57:31,110 --> 03:57:31,790
It's time?

5759
03:57:31,790 --> 03:57:32,070
Oh god.

5760
03:57:34,770 --> 03:57:36,130
It's time?

5761
03:57:36,610 --> 03:57:37,290
It's time?

5762
03:57:37,290 --> 03:57:37,930
We're trying...

5763
03:57:39,330 --> 03:57:40,330
It's time?

5764
03:57:43,250 --> 03:57:44,510
Oh god.

5765
03:57:44,610 --> 03:57:44,910
No!

5766
03:57:45,750 --> 03:57:46,430
No!

5767
03:57:48,330 --> 03:57:49,630
We didn't swap in time.

5768
03:57:50,130 --> 03:57:50,530
Alright.

5769
03:57:50,610 --> 03:57:51,310
It's Zen time.

5770
03:57:52,130 --> 03:57:52,770
It's Zen.

5771
03:57:56,150 --> 03:57:57,210
Nobody used their ult?

5772
03:57:58,150 --> 03:57:59,810
You know, we just didn't have ults.

5773
03:58:00,450 --> 03:58:00,850
Alright.

5774
03:58:00,890 --> 03:58:01,410
Zen time.

5775
03:58:03,130 --> 03:58:03,530
Alright.

5776
03:58:05,270 --> 03:58:06,770
I just don't think we should have Ren.

5777
03:58:06,970 --> 03:58:07,870
We definitely should not.

5778
03:58:07,910 --> 03:58:09,170
We should have stopped using Hammond.

5779
03:58:09,750 --> 03:58:10,810
Is this guy a Hammond one trick?

5780
03:58:10,950 --> 03:58:13,370
Am I losing because I have a Hammond one trick on my team?

5781
03:58:13,810 --> 03:58:14,510
Is that it?

5782
03:58:17,750 --> 03:58:18,750
Is this it?

5783
03:58:18,890 --> 03:58:19,030
Is this it?

5784
03:58:19,050 --> 03:58:19,770
Am I losing?

5785
03:58:22,950 --> 03:58:24,070
Because he can't swap?

5786
03:58:24,830 --> 03:58:26,490
Oh, he doesn't go voice chat.

5787
03:58:27,930 --> 03:58:28,410
Oh.

5788
03:58:28,570 --> 03:58:29,050
Okay.

5789
03:58:29,310 --> 03:58:30,070
There might be...

5790
03:58:30,070 --> 03:58:30,950
This might be it.

5791
03:58:32,250 --> 03:58:32,730
Probably.

5792
03:58:34,070 --> 03:58:36,290
No, but they have... Yeah, but like...

5793
03:58:36,970 --> 03:58:37,450
Yeah.

5794
03:58:37,950 --> 03:58:38,430
Wait.

5795
03:58:39,070 --> 03:58:39,970
Oh, thank god.

5796
03:58:40,010 --> 03:58:41,550
I was gonna be like... Oh no.

5797
03:58:43,810 --> 03:58:44,370
Alright.

5798
03:58:44,750 --> 03:58:46,210
Let's shred this hog.

5799
03:58:47,470 --> 03:58:49,550
Let's bully this hog, I guess.

5800
03:58:50,010 --> 03:58:50,990
Let's bully this hog, I guess.

5801
03:58:50,990 --> 03:58:53,190
And she's not even like a good pick.

5802
03:58:53,330 --> 03:58:54,110
It's just that...

5803
03:58:55,870 --> 03:58:58,150
I can't see the tank anywhere.

5804
03:59:01,210 --> 03:59:04,730
I can't see the tank anywhere.

5805
03:59:05,290 --> 03:59:06,290
Hammond might die here.

5806
03:59:10,010 --> 03:59:10,570
Oh!

5807
03:59:10,870 --> 03:59:11,790
He's dead though!

5808
03:59:11,890 --> 03:59:13,190
But I am solo here!

5809
03:59:13,210 --> 03:59:13,410
I'm healing.

5810
03:59:17,310 --> 03:59:17,750
No!

5811
03:59:17,750 --> 03:59:18,830
He got it!

5812
03:59:21,150 --> 03:59:21,590
No!

5813
03:59:21,750 --> 03:59:22,410
They hooked!

5814
03:59:22,630 --> 03:59:24,090
Wait, you're not going...

5815
03:59:24,090 --> 03:59:24,570
Okay.

5816
03:59:24,810 --> 03:59:26,690
If you're gonna go Mercy...

5817
03:59:27,230 --> 03:59:27,670
Alright.

5818
03:59:30,450 --> 03:59:32,650
Alright, I have to go Ana for the end.

5819
03:59:32,790 --> 03:59:34,070
Guys, this might be last game.

5820
03:59:34,850 --> 03:59:37,990
Guys, I said if I break this guy's lost streak, we're calling it.

5821
03:59:38,030 --> 03:59:39,170
That's when I know it's over.

5822
03:59:39,170 --> 03:59:39,950
Haha!

5823
03:59:41,730 --> 03:59:43,630
Lost because I had...

5824
03:59:43,630 --> 03:59:46,330
Even though this guy was a terrible Doom player.

5825
03:59:46,890 --> 03:59:48,750
I have a Hammond one trick.

5826
03:59:52,900 --> 03:59:53,520
Whoa!

5827
03:59:53,640 --> 03:59:54,260
No hook!

5828
03:59:55,700 --> 03:59:56,540
No hook!

5829
03:59:57,140 --> 03:59:58,340
We should push up.

5830
03:59:58,460 --> 03:59:59,440
We have one pick.

5831
04:00:01,090 --> 04:00:01,600
Here we go.

5832
04:00:04,340 --> 04:00:04,960
Whoa!

5833
04:00:05,080 --> 04:00:05,740
Hog's half.

5834
04:00:05,960 --> 04:00:06,680
No breather.

5835
04:00:10,220 --> 04:00:10,840
He's...

5836
04:00:10,840 --> 04:00:11,880
Somebody's anti there.

5837
04:00:12,660 --> 04:00:14,640
Guys, we have to contest point.

5838
04:00:14,780 --> 04:00:15,080
Guys!

5839
04:00:16,460 --> 04:00:17,380
Guys, please!

5840
04:00:18,720 --> 04:00:19,320
Guys!

5841
04:00:21,760 --> 04:00:22,960
Oh no!

5842
04:00:23,300 --> 04:00:24,760
He's so much dea...

5843
04:00:25,860 --> 04:00:26,460
Really?!

5844
04:00:27,300 --> 04:00:30,960
Why didn't this Doom fucking play other characters in my team?

5845
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:34,460
Oh, this is not good for us.

5846
04:00:35,380 --> 04:00:35,620
Oh!

5847
04:00:35,740 --> 04:00:36,080
Alright.

5848
04:00:37,380 --> 04:00:37,980
Oh!

5849
04:00:38,720 --> 04:00:39,700
Goodbye, Mei.

5850
04:00:43,840 --> 04:00:44,320
Alright.

5851
04:00:44,420 --> 04:00:45,300
I mean, that's cool.

5852
04:00:47,260 --> 04:00:48,560
I anti'd him though.

5853
04:00:49,880 --> 04:00:50,780
That's cool too.

5854
04:00:55,850 --> 04:00:56,330
Alright.

5855
04:00:56,370 --> 04:00:56,690
Nice.

5856
04:01:00,050 --> 04:01:00,530
Oh!

5857
04:01:06,760 --> 04:01:07,240
Please!

5858
04:01:07,240 --> 04:01:07,740
He's one!

5859
04:01:08,120 --> 04:01:08,600
Haha!

5860
04:01:09,660 --> 04:01:11,000
Oh, he doesn't have res.

5861
04:01:11,400 --> 04:01:12,460
Oh, thank god.

5862
04:01:12,540 --> 04:01:12,760
Alright.

5863
04:01:12,980 --> 04:01:15,640
Guys, we have one fight if they capped it.

5864
04:01:17,160 --> 04:01:17,640
Oh!

5865
04:01:17,780 --> 04:01:18,240
Oh!

5866
04:01:19,560 --> 04:01:21,720
Guys, that was a good last game chat.

5867
04:01:21,960 --> 04:01:23,180
You know...

5868
04:01:24,420 --> 04:01:24,980
We...

5869
04:01:24,980 --> 04:01:27,220
They might have...

5870
04:01:27,220 --> 04:01:28,040
Um...

5871
04:01:28,040 --> 04:01:30,660
The guy actually learned to swap off Doom.

5872
04:01:31,340 --> 04:01:33,180
But sadly for us...

5873
04:01:33,180 --> 04:01:36,440
Our Hammond doesn't know how to swap off when he clearly is not it.

5874
04:01:36,680 --> 04:01:37,240
Hahaha!

5875
04:01:39,200 --> 04:01:40,320
But yet...

5876
04:01:41,120 --> 04:01:41,680
Sadly...

5877
04:01:41,680 --> 04:01:44,940
Our other tank does not know that concept.

5878
04:01:45,080 --> 04:01:45,560
Unfortunately.

5879
04:01:45,560 --> 04:01:46,620
Hahaha!

5880
04:01:49,020 --> 04:01:49,620
Unfortunately...

5881
04:01:49,620 --> 04:01:52,120
That is not a concept that he knows of.

5882
04:01:56,020 --> 04:01:56,780
Get him!

5883
04:01:57,120 --> 04:01:57,960
Get him!

5884
04:01:58,280 --> 04:01:59,080
Get him!

5885
04:02:01,390 --> 04:02:01,970
Hahaha!

5886
04:02:04,010 --> 04:02:08,430
The Doom player finally got his big brother that knows how to play other heroes.

5887
04:02:08,610 --> 04:02:08,910
The Doom player finally got his big brother that knows how to play other heroes.

5888
04:02:08,910 --> 04:02:09,070
Like...

5889
04:02:09,070 --> 04:02:09,530
Hahaha!

5890
04:02:10,930 --> 04:02:12,370
He got the big...

5891
04:02:12,370 --> 04:02:15,410
The big brother that actually knows how to counter swap.

5892
04:02:15,750 --> 04:02:18,350
He fucking swapped to Hammond!

5893
04:02:18,510 --> 04:02:19,110
Hahaha!

5894
04:02:19,250 --> 04:02:19,770
Hahaha!

5895
04:02:20,910 --> 04:02:22,450
What the fuck?

5896
04:02:23,690 --> 04:02:25,010
This is not fair.

5897
04:02:28,330 --> 04:02:30,530
I want him to live.

5898
04:02:33,610 --> 04:02:35,850
I'm expecting him to live right now.

5899
04:02:35,990 --> 04:02:37,230
He's literally nano'd.

5900
04:02:43,530 --> 04:02:44,330
Oh god.

5901
04:02:44,830 --> 04:02:45,990
That's all that matter.

5902
04:02:48,070 --> 04:02:48,710
What?

5903
04:02:48,750 --> 04:02:50,310
How did that not hit the anti?

5904
04:02:50,710 --> 04:02:53,010
How did that not hit the anti?

5905
04:02:53,010 --> 04:02:53,670
The anti didn't hit.

5906
04:02:53,730 --> 04:02:54,710
It was crazy.

5907
04:02:55,470 --> 04:02:56,270
Or no faith.

5908
04:02:57,570 --> 04:02:58,150
Mara won.

5909
04:03:01,840 --> 04:03:02,580
Oh my god.

5910
04:03:02,640 --> 04:03:02,980
There you are.

5911
04:03:04,900 --> 04:03:05,380
Please.

5912
04:03:05,560 --> 04:03:06,540
I slept him.

5913
04:03:06,920 --> 04:03:08,100
I slept him.

5914
04:03:08,100 --> 04:03:08,340
Guys!

5915
04:03:09,520 --> 04:03:10,000
Please!

5916
04:03:10,400 --> 04:03:11,540
I never sleep!

5917
04:03:12,520 --> 04:03:13,000
Hahaha!

5918
04:03:14,160 --> 04:03:15,000
Oh no.

5919
04:03:15,100 --> 04:03:15,840
He clearly won.

5920
04:03:17,620 --> 04:03:18,100
Hahaha!

5921
04:03:18,620 --> 04:03:18,700
Hahaha!

5922
04:03:19,860 --> 04:03:21,040
Oh my god.

5923
04:03:21,080 --> 04:03:21,260
Wait.

5924
04:03:21,320 --> 04:03:21,800
We did it.

5925
04:03:21,880 --> 04:03:22,120
Yay!

5926
04:03:22,120 --> 04:03:23,140
Hahaha!

5927
04:03:24,640 --> 04:03:25,480
Yay!

5928
04:03:26,500 --> 04:03:29,380
His last streak continues!

5929
04:03:29,860 --> 04:03:29,960
Hahaha!

5930
04:03:31,240 --> 04:03:32,080
Oh!

5931
04:03:33,020 --> 04:03:34,500
Oh my god.

5932
04:03:34,600 --> 04:03:35,440
Thank god!

5933
04:03:36,040 --> 04:03:38,240
His last streak continues!

5934
04:03:38,960 --> 04:03:40,280
That's all I care.

5935
04:03:40,520 --> 04:03:41,180
Hahaha!

5936
04:03:41,180 --> 04:03:42,720
That's all I care about.

5937
04:03:42,940 --> 04:03:44,880
I'm glad he keeps losing.

5938
04:03:46,880 --> 04:03:47,720
Yay!

5939
04:03:48,220 --> 04:03:48,720
Hahaha!

5940
04:03:48,720 --> 04:03:49,060
Hahaha!

5941
04:03:50,640 --> 04:03:51,940
Keep going down!

5942
04:03:52,240 --> 04:03:53,620
Let me keep farming you!

5943
04:03:55,100 --> 04:03:56,180
How long have I been streaming?

5944
04:03:56,360 --> 04:03:56,800
4 hours?

5945
04:03:57,040 --> 04:03:58,440
This is what happens in Overwatch.

5946
04:03:58,620 --> 04:03:59,240
You just keep playing.

5947
04:03:59,520 --> 04:04:00,620
It's so hard to quit.

5948
04:04:00,980 --> 04:04:01,680
Oh my god.

5949
04:04:01,680 --> 04:04:02,040
It's 9.

5950
04:04:02,940 --> 04:04:04,100
Oh my god.

5951
04:04:04,120 --> 04:04:05,500
It's so hard to quit, guys.

5952
04:04:09,580 --> 04:04:10,060
Oh!

5953
04:04:10,480 --> 04:04:11,380
We keep going.

5954
04:04:12,240 --> 04:04:13,620
I'm still on Master 5?

5955
04:04:14,000 --> 04:04:14,220
Hey!

5956
04:04:14,300 --> 04:04:16,360
I didn't rank from Master 3 to Master 5.

5957
04:04:16,860 --> 04:04:18,240
I'm like technically up.

5958
04:04:18,460 --> 04:04:18,940
Hahaha!

5959
04:04:20,820 --> 04:04:23,020
I almost got to Master 4.

5960
04:04:23,360 --> 04:04:23,900
But like...

5961
04:04:23,900 --> 04:04:24,800
And then I started losing.

5962
04:04:25,000 --> 04:04:28,280
And then I lost the points I gained.

5963
04:04:28,480 --> 04:04:28,860
So...

5964
04:04:29,500 --> 04:04:30,980
You win some, you lose some.

5965
04:04:31,180 --> 04:04:32,500
It's the way of Overwatch.

5966
04:04:35,360 --> 04:04:36,400
Sadly, Overwatch...

5967
04:04:36,400 --> 04:04:37,640
You just don't win.

5968
04:04:41,800 --> 04:04:42,700
You don't win.

5969
04:04:42,820 --> 04:04:43,540
No matter what.

5970
04:04:43,600 --> 04:04:44,560
Because you're playing the game.

5971
04:04:48,310 --> 04:04:49,190
What do you mean?

5972
04:04:49,490 --> 04:04:50,930
I'm Master 5 right now.

5973
04:04:51,710 --> 04:04:52,230
See?

5974
04:04:55,350 --> 04:04:56,390
Oh my god.

5975
04:04:56,970 --> 04:04:57,890
I'm almost...

5976
04:04:57,890 --> 04:04:59,610
I almost won 50 games.

5977
04:05:01,970 --> 04:05:03,550
Do I really want to win?

5978
04:05:04,030 --> 04:05:05,710
I will call in a duo.

5979
04:05:06,570 --> 04:05:07,510
To play tank.

5980
04:05:08,030 --> 04:05:08,550
Hahaha!

5981
04:05:09,050 --> 04:05:10,990
And all I do is just nano them.

5982
04:05:11,170 --> 04:05:11,690
Hahaha!

5983
04:05:13,370 --> 04:05:13,890
Hahaha!

5984
04:05:15,550 --> 04:05:16,630
That's literally it.

5985
04:05:17,210 --> 04:05:19,410
That's the way to climb for real.

5986
04:05:21,110 --> 04:05:24,070
I just need to call a duo tank or a duo Ilari.

5987
04:05:24,490 --> 04:05:25,010
I just need to call a duo tank or a duo Ilari.

5988
04:05:28,600 --> 04:05:29,700
Alright, next game.

5989
04:05:32,300 --> 04:05:33,460
Oh, it's not him!

5990
04:05:34,580 --> 04:05:36,220
Master 5 and Master 3.

5991
04:05:36,400 --> 04:05:36,720
Okay.

5992
04:05:37,120 --> 04:05:38,360
It's getting more competitive.

5993
04:05:38,740 --> 04:05:40,560
Yeah, you win by making other people lose.

5994
04:05:40,840 --> 04:05:41,100
Alright.

5995
04:05:42,580 --> 04:05:43,100
Push.

5996
04:05:43,400 --> 04:05:44,640
I thought I avoided push.

5997
04:05:45,000 --> 04:05:47,520
I had so many games that are not push.

5998
04:05:47,760 --> 04:05:48,680
That I enjoyed.

5999
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:54,140
I had so many games that I was so happy about.

6000
04:05:55,480 --> 04:05:56,300
But like...

6001
04:05:56,300 --> 04:05:57,540
I guess, you know...

6002
04:05:57,840 --> 04:05:59,540
Happy has got to stop somewhere.

6003
04:06:03,450 --> 04:06:04,950
I had to stop feeling happy.

6004
04:06:05,570 --> 04:06:06,130
Today.

6005
04:06:08,250 --> 04:06:08,810
Like...

6006
04:06:09,490 --> 04:06:10,250
It knew.

6007
04:06:10,530 --> 04:06:11,470
The game knew.

6008
04:06:11,730 --> 04:06:13,690
We will find tranquility.

6009
04:06:14,610 --> 04:06:15,690
The game was like...

6010
04:06:15,690 --> 04:06:17,270
It's time to stop being happy.

6011
04:06:17,970 --> 04:06:20,510
We want you to play a push map now.

6012
04:06:22,330 --> 04:06:23,270
So sad.

6013
04:06:23,790 --> 04:06:25,670
Siri, please play Despacito.

6014
04:06:30,980 --> 04:06:33,120
I hate... Yeah, I played the new push map.

6015
04:06:33,260 --> 04:06:34,320
I played it.

6016
04:06:35,740 --> 04:06:36,600
No happy.

6017
04:06:36,840 --> 04:06:37,280
You're right.

6018
04:06:37,380 --> 04:06:39,120
Nobody is actually happy when they played Overwatch.

6019
04:06:40,100 --> 04:06:41,620
And the best game I had...

6020
04:06:41,620 --> 04:06:42,600
Was the last game.

6021
04:06:43,060 --> 04:06:44,280
Because of my...

6022
04:06:44,280 --> 04:06:47,040
Because I finally slept some players.

6023
04:06:47,480 --> 04:06:49,120
And also that Kiriko match.

6024
04:06:49,240 --> 04:06:51,120
Against that really fucking good Doom player.

6025
04:06:51,960 --> 04:06:52,960
Oh no.

6026
04:06:53,140 --> 04:06:53,640
Not...

6027
04:06:54,880 --> 04:06:55,960
Oh no.

6028
04:06:57,140 --> 04:06:58,220
Oh no.

6029
04:06:59,400 --> 04:07:00,940
Yeah, I'm not playing Zenyatta.

6030
04:07:01,240 --> 04:07:02,520
I'm not playing Zenyatta.

6031
04:07:02,620 --> 04:07:03,240
They literally have to...

6032
04:07:03,260 --> 04:07:04,680
They literally have to have Hammond and...

6033
04:07:05,220 --> 04:07:06,600
That is not a fun comp.

6034
04:07:06,800 --> 04:07:07,840
That is not fun.

6035
04:07:08,200 --> 04:07:09,600
That is actually not fun.

6036
04:07:11,080 --> 04:07:12,460
That is like...

6037
04:07:13,060 --> 04:07:14,520
It's time to stop having fun.

6038
04:07:17,280 --> 04:07:17,800
Alright.

6039
04:07:18,400 --> 04:07:20,700
Two bully Zenyatta players for this.

6040
04:07:21,020 --> 04:07:21,640
Can I go...

6041
04:07:21,640 --> 04:07:23,220
Alright, I'm gonna play Mora.

6042
04:07:23,400 --> 04:07:23,800
Alright.

6043
04:07:27,860 --> 04:07:29,060
Ana, you should swap.

6044
04:07:29,200 --> 04:07:30,020
You're not gonna have fun.

6045
04:07:31,060 --> 04:07:32,940
You're 100% not gonna have fun.

6046
04:07:33,060 --> 04:07:33,220
You're 100% not gonna have fun.

6047
04:07:33,680 --> 04:07:35,460
They literally have Sombra.

6048
04:07:36,360 --> 04:07:37,320
Sombra Hammond!

6049
04:07:39,700 --> 04:07:41,720
That's the day that Fun died.

6050
04:07:43,980 --> 04:07:44,780
That's the day that Fun died.

6051
04:07:44,780 --> 04:07:46,480
Aww, he was so low too.

6052
04:07:46,620 --> 04:07:46,700
Aww, he was so low too.

6053
04:07:46,700 --> 04:07:46,880
Oh, nice.

6054
04:07:49,240 --> 04:07:50,060
The day...

6055
04:07:50,060 --> 04:07:50,940
The day... Spun had died.

6056
04:07:52,480 --> 04:07:53,720
Are they still pushing?

6057
04:07:54,000 --> 04:07:54,840
Oh shit!

6058
04:07:57,120 --> 04:07:57,740
It's okay.

6059
04:07:57,880 --> 04:07:58,380
I got you.

6060
04:08:00,320 --> 04:08:01,060
It's okay.

6061
04:08:03,700 --> 04:08:04,780
He's still alive?

6062
04:08:06,120 --> 04:08:06,600
Alright.

6063
04:08:07,560 --> 04:08:08,480
We run away.

6064
04:08:10,760 --> 04:08:12,340
I am not playing...

6065
04:08:12,340 --> 04:08:14,200
I am not playing... any non-mobile characters.

6066
04:08:14,720 --> 04:08:16,100
Also, I'm tired of playing on...

6067
04:08:16,100 --> 04:08:17,060
Also, I'm tired of playing on... Kiriko.

6068
04:08:18,660 --> 04:08:20,900
This Ana can swap to Kiriko if he wants to.

6069
04:08:21,140 --> 04:08:21,160
This Ana can swap to Kiriko if he wants to.

6070
04:08:21,180 --> 04:08:22,640
I'm fucking tired of Kiriko.

6071
04:08:22,880 --> 04:08:24,080
I played so much Kiriko today.

6072
04:08:25,060 --> 04:08:26,900
Because nobody else was playing Kiriko.

6073
04:08:27,400 --> 04:08:28,100
It sucks.

6074
04:08:28,180 --> 04:08:30,000
Whenever they have Ana, you have to play Kiriko.

6075
04:08:30,020 --> 04:08:30,120
It sucks.

6076
04:08:30,120 --> 04:08:30,260
Whenever they have Ana, you have to play Kiriko.

6077
04:08:31,100 --> 04:08:32,980
So nobody is happy.

6078
04:08:34,660 --> 04:08:36,380
No one gets to be happy!

6079
04:08:36,860 --> 04:08:37,440
No one gets to be happy!

6080
04:08:37,440 --> 04:08:37,800
Oh no.

6081
04:08:39,220 --> 04:08:41,380
Please, just touch me.

6082
04:08:42,680 --> 04:08:43,460
There we go.

6083
04:08:43,740 --> 04:08:44,320
Nice.

6084
04:08:47,080 --> 04:08:48,140
Get him out!

6085
04:08:48,660 --> 04:08:52,340
Get him out!

6086
04:08:52,340 --> 04:08:52,580
Alright.

6087
04:08:54,400 --> 04:08:55,880
Thank you Ana.

6088
04:08:57,960 --> 04:08:58,940
Goodbye Ana.

6089
04:08:59,300 --> 04:09:00,080
Goodbye Ana.

6090
04:09:03,040 --> 04:09:05,500
I did not think you would actually die.

6091
04:09:10,820 --> 04:09:11,380
Goodbye.

6092
04:09:11,560 --> 04:09:12,000
Goodbye.

6093
04:09:15,400 --> 04:09:16,460
Holy shit.

6094
04:09:16,580 --> 04:09:18,720
The enemy team is actually antifun.

6095
04:09:19,640 --> 04:09:20,300
The enemy team is actually antifun.

6096
04:09:20,300 --> 04:09:23,380
This is the most antifun team I've ever seen.

6097
04:09:23,700 --> 04:09:23,760
This is the most antifun team I've ever seen.

6098
04:09:23,980 --> 04:09:24,540
Fucking...

6099
04:09:25,400 --> 04:09:27,060
Sombra, Mora, Hammond.

6100
04:09:27,960 --> 04:09:29,760
That is so antifun.

6101
04:09:29,760 --> 04:09:30,000
That is so antifun.

6102
04:09:30,080 --> 04:09:31,420
Oh my god.

6103
04:09:32,860 --> 04:09:34,660
You guys wonder why I'm tapping?

6104
04:09:34,900 --> 04:09:38,100
Because you regen your heals faster if you tap.

6105
04:09:41,720 --> 04:09:43,500
All right, I'm gonna do something stupid.

6106
04:09:46,120 --> 04:09:47,720
I'm gonna do something really stupid.

6107
04:09:48,820 --> 04:09:49,740
They're all gone.

6108
04:09:53,280 --> 04:09:54,700
Oh shit, okay.

6109
04:09:55,360 --> 04:09:56,860
All right, I'm sorry.

6110
04:09:56,960 --> 04:09:58,020
I can't heal you guys there.

6111
04:09:58,660 --> 04:09:59,280
That's good.

6112
04:09:59,380 --> 04:09:59,740
That's good.

6113
04:09:59,820 --> 04:10:01,280
I'm gonna keep you up so you can...

6114
04:10:01,280 --> 04:10:05,960
Guys I tried.

6115
04:10:08,980 --> 04:10:10,520
All right, we did it nano.

6116
04:10:10,720 --> 04:10:13,920
Oh, our other team got separated by the Hammond.

6117
04:10:13,980 --> 04:10:15,480
Please somebody play Sombra!

6118
04:10:16,600 --> 04:10:18,540
Anybody play Sombra!

6119
04:10:19,300 --> 04:10:22,840
Braink does nothing against this cop because they have a Sombra!

6120
04:10:26,680 --> 04:10:27,980
It's so easy!

6121
04:10:27,980 --> 04:10:29,440
This is a counter anti-fun!

6122
04:10:31,060 --> 04:10:33,280
We just need a Sombra!

6123
04:10:34,340 --> 04:10:35,920
That's literally it.

6124
04:10:36,200 --> 04:10:41,460
If we want a counter anti-fun, just go Sombra.

6125
04:10:44,640 --> 04:10:48,680
Oh my god, I'm sorry man, but like I'm fucking...

6126
04:10:48,680 --> 04:10:50,180
Oh my god.

6127
04:10:55,720 --> 04:10:56,780
Holy shit.

6128
04:11:00,140 --> 04:11:01,060
This team.

6129
04:11:01,320 --> 04:11:03,540
You know, the best thing about push is a curse.

6130
04:11:03,960 --> 04:11:07,900
But the best thing about push is that when your team is garbage, it ends faster.

6131
04:11:08,100 --> 04:11:08,780
So thank god.

6132
04:11:09,860 --> 04:11:10,920
Thank god for that.

6133
04:11:12,200 --> 04:11:14,160
And people were like, why don't you play?

6134
04:11:14,580 --> 04:11:15,980
Why don't you play Braink?

6135
04:11:15,980 --> 04:11:17,740
Because they literally have Sombra.

6136
04:11:18,160 --> 04:11:21,460
And like all Sombra has to do is hack me and I'm fucking useless.

6137
04:11:24,660 --> 04:11:25,820
That's why it's like...

6138
04:11:26,300 --> 04:11:27,640
We need... we need...

6139
04:11:27,640 --> 04:11:28,940
We need end...

6140
04:11:28,940 --> 04:11:33,480
we need it and we need our own team Sombra to just make the Hammond like...

6141
04:11:33,480 --> 04:11:34,120
swap.

6142
04:11:34,780 --> 04:11:37,060
Because the Hammond is the problem.

6143
04:11:38,440 --> 04:11:39,000
Catch it!

6144
04:11:39,520 --> 04:11:40,460
Come down!

6145
04:11:44,690 --> 04:11:45,830
Clearly, that's it.

6146
04:11:46,930 --> 04:11:49,850
I'm always running out because I can't build charge!

6147
04:11:53,290 --> 04:11:54,390
Oh god, D.va.

6148
04:11:54,450 --> 04:11:55,110
Please, D.va.

6149
04:11:55,370 --> 04:11:57,810
I do not have enough charge for you.

6150
04:11:58,250 --> 04:11:58,850
Please.

6151
04:11:58,850 --> 04:11:59,270
Please, D.Va.

6152
04:11:59,630 --> 04:12:03,250
Please, I literally... D.Va, please.

6153
04:12:06,650 --> 04:12:08,050
Please, D.Va.

6154
04:12:08,310 --> 04:12:09,690
Please, catch the orb!

6155
04:12:10,730 --> 04:12:11,850
Oh, no!

6156
04:12:13,090 --> 04:12:13,710
No!

6157
04:12:15,730 --> 04:12:16,610
No, Ana!

6158
04:12:17,170 --> 04:12:18,590
I got you, Ana!

6159
04:12:22,400 --> 04:12:23,020
Please!

6160
04:12:23,320 --> 04:12:24,880
Wait, where's our fucking Ashe?

6161
04:12:24,880 --> 04:12:25,140
Ash!

6162
04:12:25,300 --> 04:12:26,920
When the fuck did he Ashe?

6163
04:12:27,060 --> 04:12:30,220
You play Reaper, but non Sombra?!

6164
04:12:32,700 --> 04:12:33,220
Okay...

6165
04:12:37,080 --> 04:12:39,760
I'm not blaming the tank, I'm blaming our DPS!

6166
04:12:40,260 --> 04:12:44,920
The easiest counter to Hammin is a Sombra, and all he has to do is hack him 24-7.

6167
04:12:45,180 --> 04:12:47,520
So he cannot be... you don't have to be useful.

6168
04:12:47,700 --> 04:12:48,900
You just hack him!

6169
04:12:49,960 --> 04:12:51,280
That's literally it!

6170
04:12:51,560 --> 04:12:53,820
You don't even have to be useful!

6171
04:12:54,040 --> 04:12:54,860
You just hack him 24-7.

6172
04:12:54,860 --> 04:12:55,500
Let's hack him.

6173
04:12:58,410 --> 04:13:01,180
You run Reaper but not Sombra.

6174
04:13:01,280 --> 04:13:03,140
He's clearly willing to swap.

6175
04:13:07,980 --> 04:13:10,540
Our tank... our tank... there's nothing he can do.

6176
04:13:11,380 --> 04:13:14,200
Unless he runs... like... I don't know.

6177
04:13:14,260 --> 04:13:15,600
I don't know what he can run as a tank.

6178
04:13:15,840 --> 04:13:19,000
But like, we can do something about... this Hammond.

6179
04:13:22,860 --> 04:13:23,960
We can...

6180
04:13:24,680 --> 04:13:25,940
Did you see that?

6181
04:13:26,000 --> 04:13:26,880
Did you see that?

6182
04:13:27,160 --> 04:13:29,020
Our Eagg... our tank...

6183
04:13:29,020 --> 04:13:31,340
We're gonna shoot at this Reaper.

6184
04:13:33,820 --> 04:13:35,720
Throw him... bro he understands.

6185
04:13:36,560 --> 04:13:38,040
He fucking...

6186
04:13:39,040 --> 04:13:41,660
I thought so too.

6187
04:13:42,120 --> 04:13:44,000
What the fuck are you shooting?

6188
04:13:50,940 --> 04:13:53,160
At least I'm not the only one that's going, huh?

6189
04:13:56,180 --> 04:13:57,000
He knows.

6190
04:14:00,870 --> 04:14:01,830
Even he knows.

6191
04:14:03,470 --> 04:14:04,970
Even he's like, what the fuck?

6192
04:14:05,650 --> 04:14:06,830
What the fuck are you gonna do?

6193
04:14:14,820 --> 04:14:15,620
Oh my god.

6194
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:18,740
That's on him.

6195
04:14:20,160 --> 04:14:21,120
That's on him.

6196
04:14:22,400 --> 04:14:23,320
Jesus Christ.

6197
04:14:24,580 --> 04:14:25,280
Oh my god.

6198
04:14:25,420 --> 04:14:25,560
Oh my god.

6199
04:14:25,580 --> 04:14:26,960
I need my fucking charge here.

6200
04:14:29,380 --> 04:14:30,300
Jesus Christ.

6201
04:14:30,480 --> 04:14:33,780
I'm just gonna do this to fucking survive.

6202
04:14:34,420 --> 04:14:35,140
Okay!

6203
04:14:35,980 --> 04:14:36,820
Ummm...

6204
04:14:38,240 --> 04:14:38,660
Alright.

6205
04:14:39,860 --> 04:14:43,240
Guess I'm just gonna suck a little harder here.

6206
04:14:44,680 --> 04:14:46,320
Just gonna push it.

6207
04:14:48,200 --> 04:14:49,880
Goodbye... goodbye...

6208
04:14:49,880 --> 04:14:51,480
I'll see you later.

6209
04:14:53,360 --> 04:14:55,040
Goodbye... goodbye...

6210
04:14:56,680 --> 04:14:57,240
Goodbye...

6211
04:14:57,240 --> 04:14:58,200
Let the push commence.

6212
04:15:01,200 --> 04:15:03,420
I get to push it a little... more.

6213
04:15:05,500 --> 04:15:07,160
Cure for all the dames.

6214
04:15:07,220 --> 04:15:08,000
They stole the robot from us!

6215
04:15:08,140 --> 04:15:08,700
Goodbye...

6216
04:15:08,700 --> 04:15:09,160
Whoa!

6217
04:15:09,840 --> 04:15:11,620
Okay, everybody chased.

6218
04:15:11,760 --> 04:15:15,360
It's okay, I got... I was able to push it back.

6219
04:15:15,640 --> 04:15:17,200
That's all that matters.

6220
04:15:17,680 --> 04:15:19,420
What the fuck is wrong with this?

6221
04:15:20,800 --> 04:15:21,920
Oh shit.

6222
04:15:22,180 --> 04:15:23,180
I'm always persecuted.

6223
04:15:25,580 --> 04:15:27,260
Oh my god, our team... our team.

6224
04:15:29,740 --> 04:15:30,380
Bro!

6225
04:15:30,580 --> 04:15:31,080
Bro!

6226
04:15:31,180 --> 04:15:31,520
How?

6227
04:15:31,840 --> 04:15:32,360
How?

6228
04:15:32,500 --> 04:15:34,140
We are trying our fucking best!

6229
04:15:34,500 --> 04:15:35,600
You're on Reaper!

6230
04:15:35,760 --> 04:15:37,140
Where do you learn from?

6231
04:15:37,200 --> 04:15:38,700
You're literally on Reaper.

6232
04:15:39,660 --> 04:15:42,640
And I'm surprised our Ana is still on Ana.

6233
04:15:44,760 --> 04:15:47,280
After like... this world of pain.

6234
04:15:50,160 --> 04:15:54,560
I'm just surprised... he's still willing to go fucking Ana.

6235
04:15:54,560 --> 04:15:56,060
It's not fun.

6236
04:15:56,580 --> 04:15:58,940
There's a reason why I'm not playing fucking Ana.

6237
04:16:00,440 --> 04:16:01,880
It's not fun at all.

6238
04:16:04,740 --> 04:16:07,900
This is like... yeah, like I said, it's literally anti-fun.

6239
04:16:08,160 --> 04:16:09,540
Oh my god.

6240
04:16:09,980 --> 04:16:10,500
Okay.

6241
04:16:10,760 --> 04:16:12,820
See, this is all you do, you hack!

6242
04:16:14,060 --> 04:16:14,960
You hack!

6243
04:16:19,840 --> 04:16:21,620
That literally could be you!

6244
04:16:24,580 --> 04:16:26,200
That's literally you!

6245
04:16:29,680 --> 04:16:31,500
That's literally you Ana!

6246
04:16:34,960 --> 04:16:35,420
Okay.

6247
04:16:36,120 --> 04:16:37,180
We gotta go there.

6248
04:16:39,680 --> 04:16:41,020
Are you serious?

6249
04:16:41,460 --> 04:16:41,920
No!

6250
04:16:42,080 --> 04:16:43,260
I died above all!

6251
04:16:43,740 --> 04:16:47,160
I didn't think I was gonna get hit but I didn't see the diamond of light!

6252
04:16:48,360 --> 04:16:49,340
Please Ana, please.

6253
04:16:49,540 --> 04:16:50,260
I've made you...

6254
04:16:50,260 --> 04:16:51,600
I've let you live for so long...

6255
04:16:51,600 --> 04:16:52,760
I need you to live.

6256
04:16:52,940 --> 04:16:55,100
I didn't see the dynamite.

6257
04:16:55,960 --> 04:16:57,380
I was trying to hide.

6258
04:16:58,140 --> 04:17:00,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6259
04:17:00,340 --> 04:17:01,760
Everybody is so critical.

6260
04:17:02,020 --> 04:17:02,900
No, no, no.

6261
04:17:03,740 --> 04:17:04,980
Catch the orb!

6262
04:17:07,020 --> 04:17:08,260
Catch the orb!

6263
04:17:08,820 --> 04:17:10,620
I can't get to people!

6264
04:17:12,840 --> 04:17:13,980
Catch the orb!

6265
04:17:17,680 --> 04:17:18,500
Oh god.

6266
04:17:19,280 --> 04:17:20,100
Oh god.

6267
04:17:22,820 --> 04:17:23,700
This is bad.

6268
04:17:25,400 --> 04:17:26,260
This is bad.

6269
04:17:26,400 --> 04:17:27,480
This is so bad.

6270
04:17:30,700 --> 04:17:32,460
No, he's so...

6271
04:17:37,690 --> 04:17:40,470
No, he's so...

6272
04:17:43,290 --> 04:17:46,490
No, he's... No, no, I have... I can't.

6273
04:17:46,510 --> 04:17:47,650
I cannot play with this team.

6274
04:17:50,630 --> 04:17:52,210
He's so... for now.

6275
04:17:53,250 --> 04:17:55,010
I have to see Sombra.

6276
04:17:55,970 --> 04:17:58,690
Okay, we're gonna see who is the Reaper.

6277
04:18:02,610 --> 04:18:06,450
After everything we've been through, he was Sombra now.

6278
04:18:10,080 --> 04:18:11,100
Oh, wait.

6279
04:18:11,700 --> 04:18:14,600
Did you see how impressive their Sombra was?

6280
04:18:22,830 --> 04:18:23,990
Oh my god.

6281
04:18:24,910 --> 04:18:26,850
Oh my god, that was...

6282
04:18:26,850 --> 04:18:28,350
That was the most...

6283
04:18:28,350 --> 04:18:30,570
That was the game of all time.

6284
04:18:30,910 --> 04:18:33,490
That was truly the game of all time.

6285
04:18:34,010 --> 04:18:34,990
Is there a gun game?

6286
04:18:35,690 --> 04:18:38,010
I haven't seen like an actual gun game.

6287
04:18:38,270 --> 04:18:39,210
Oh wait, no, it's an arcade.

6288
04:18:39,570 --> 04:18:40,390
I forgot.

6289
04:18:40,570 --> 04:18:43,530
They like took away gun game in custom and put it in an arcade.

6290
04:18:43,730 --> 04:18:44,250
That sucks.

6291
04:18:44,770 --> 04:18:46,750
I wish there was gun game in...

6292
04:18:48,230 --> 04:18:49,150
Waiting for Q.

6293
04:18:51,450 --> 04:18:52,530
Oh my god.

6294
04:18:52,650 --> 04:18:53,490
That was...

6295
04:18:54,150 --> 04:18:55,110
That was the worst.

6296
04:18:55,570 --> 04:18:56,930
That was actually the worst.

6297
04:18:58,470 --> 04:19:00,250
Alright, this is my last game for real though.

6298
04:19:00,450 --> 04:19:01,250
Loss or win.

6299
04:19:02,710 --> 04:19:04,190
This is my last game for real.

6300
04:19:04,830 --> 04:19:05,850
That was fun though.

6301
04:19:05,930 --> 04:19:07,070
I love Overwatch, Frank.

6302
04:19:07,610 --> 04:19:08,050
Cause...

6303
04:19:08,050 --> 04:19:09,010
When you're...

6304
04:19:09,010 --> 04:19:09,790
Don't take it seriously.

6305
04:19:10,770 --> 04:19:13,310
Despite how much I was raging, I was not taking it seriously.

6306
04:19:16,750 --> 04:19:17,630
This is...

6307
04:19:19,410 --> 04:19:21,450
This is my last game for real though.

6308
04:19:22,190 --> 04:19:22,770
Let's see.

6309
04:19:22,950 --> 04:19:23,990
We'll practice Sleep Dart.

6310
04:19:25,050 --> 04:19:26,530
We'll practice our Sleep Darts.

6311
04:19:28,030 --> 04:19:29,050
Can I end on a loss?

6312
04:19:29,150 --> 04:19:29,310
Yes.

6313
04:19:29,470 --> 04:19:30,210
That's a bait.

6314
04:19:30,470 --> 04:19:32,930
That's a bait to make you like fucking play this game forever.

6315
04:19:33,590 --> 04:19:34,270
You can't...

6316
04:19:34,270 --> 04:19:34,950
You can't fool me.

6317
04:19:36,210 --> 04:19:37,830
You can't fucking fool me, guys.

6318
04:19:38,670 --> 04:19:42,610
Cause then you're like, oh, if I win, you guys would be like, oh, but you can't like...

6319
04:19:42,610 --> 04:19:44,430
You can't just like end it...

6320
04:19:44,430 --> 04:19:46,210
You can't just end on a...

6321
04:19:46,830 --> 04:19:47,830
On a win streak.

6322
04:19:49,350 --> 04:19:50,350
And then it's a cycle.

6323
04:19:51,450 --> 04:19:52,730
You guys can't fool me.

6324
04:19:55,810 --> 04:19:56,230
You can't fool me.

6325
04:19:56,230 --> 04:19:58,210
I was like... I know that experience.

6326
04:19:58,470 --> 04:19:59,090
You can't fool me.

6327
04:20:04,890 --> 04:20:07,270
How many points do you have to do?

6328
04:20:07,350 --> 04:20:07,790
4 minutes?

6329
04:20:11,470 --> 04:20:11,890
Oh!

6330
04:20:16,570 --> 04:20:17,950
You had to hit that one shot.

6331
04:20:20,950 --> 04:20:21,530
I swear.

6332
04:20:21,670 --> 04:20:23,090
If I got hit by that...

6333
04:20:24,290 --> 04:20:24,810
Look at the sleep dart.

6334
04:20:25,230 --> 04:20:26,150
Where is he?

6335
04:20:29,890 --> 04:20:30,530
Whoa!

6336
04:20:31,910 --> 04:20:32,550
No!

6337
04:20:33,330 --> 04:20:33,970
No!

6338
04:20:34,990 --> 04:20:36,530
I can't shoot down!

6339
04:20:42,580 --> 04:20:43,220
No!

6340
04:20:47,660 --> 04:20:48,300
Nice.

6341
04:20:48,540 --> 04:20:49,480
That's fucking right.

6342
04:20:49,940 --> 04:20:51,740
How do you... what's the winning point?

6343
04:20:52,200 --> 04:20:56,860
Why is there... oh, they added a bot that advertises their Discord.

6344
04:21:00,020 --> 04:21:00,540
What?!

6345
04:21:01,340 --> 04:21:02,860
You won because of ping.

6346
04:21:03,620 --> 04:21:05,000
Am I Mug Meal or no?

6347
04:21:05,060 --> 04:21:05,500
I'm ChaCha.

6348
04:21:07,860 --> 04:21:08,380
Okay.

6349
04:21:08,560 --> 04:21:09,540
It's so hard to sleep.

6350
04:21:10,300 --> 04:21:11,240
It's like...

6351
04:21:13,020 --> 04:21:15,580
It's much easier to just shoot your gun.

6352
04:21:17,800 --> 04:21:18,700
Where are you?

6353
04:21:22,140 --> 04:21:23,060
Where are you?

6354
04:21:23,440 --> 04:21:24,420
That's fucking right.

6355
04:21:25,820 --> 04:21:26,840
Where are you?

6356
04:21:28,940 --> 04:21:29,640
Are you behind me?

6357
04:21:30,640 --> 04:21:30,980
Hello?

6358
04:21:31,540 --> 04:21:32,320
Hello there.

6359
04:21:32,460 --> 04:21:32,820
Hello.

6360
04:21:33,220 --> 04:21:33,800
I'm in Eve.

6361
04:21:33,900 --> 04:21:34,380
That's right.

6362
04:21:34,560 --> 04:21:35,200
Where am I?

6363
04:21:37,060 --> 04:21:38,560
They didn't see that.

6364
04:21:43,460 --> 04:21:44,020
Alright.

6365
04:21:45,500 --> 04:21:47,560
Master 5 to Master 4.

6366
04:21:47,840 --> 04:21:49,060
Select your hero.

6367
04:21:49,240 --> 04:21:49,880
Let's go.

6368
04:21:51,440 --> 04:21:52,000
Alright.

6369
04:21:52,080 --> 04:21:52,680
Let's see.

6370
04:21:54,240 --> 04:21:54,800
Defend.

6371
04:21:55,200 --> 04:21:55,760
Alright.

6372
04:21:55,800 --> 04:21:56,220
I want to play Ana.

6373
04:21:56,500 --> 04:21:57,520
Is this where we're playing Ana?

6374
04:21:58,380 --> 04:22:00,260
Literally, one is an actual...

6375
04:22:02,600 --> 04:22:04,140
It's an actual...

6376
04:22:05,200 --> 04:22:05,900
What's the word?

6377
04:22:06,100 --> 04:22:07,220
It's an actual player's name.

6378
04:22:07,400 --> 04:22:08,000
I remember.

6379
04:22:08,240 --> 04:22:10,360
Before like streamer mode was a thing.

6380
04:22:10,500 --> 04:22:11,880
This is an actual player name.

6381
04:22:15,100 --> 04:22:15,580
Zip.

6382
04:22:16,860 --> 04:22:18,200
I got waffle on tank.

6383
04:22:18,500 --> 04:22:19,640
Who is waffle man?

6384
04:22:19,980 --> 04:22:21,480
Do I remember waffle man?

6385
04:22:21,960 --> 04:22:23,040
Is he in my game?

6386
04:22:26,020 --> 04:22:26,500
Yeah.

6387
04:22:26,500 --> 04:22:27,900
Isn't Icy also a pro name?

6388
04:22:28,500 --> 04:22:30,280
Yeah, but Icy is a DPS player.

6389
04:22:30,520 --> 04:22:31,640
This is not the real Icy.

6390
04:22:31,640 --> 04:22:32,440
There's no way.

6391
04:22:32,500 --> 04:22:34,300
Is this a real Icy playing fucking Mora?

6392
04:22:34,440 --> 04:22:36,520
No, this is a Mora main.

6393
04:22:39,060 --> 04:22:39,700
Yeah, guys.

6394
04:22:39,760 --> 04:22:41,300
I don't think this is the same Icy, guys.

6395
04:22:42,380 --> 04:22:45,100
This is Icy the fucking Mora one trick.

6396
04:22:45,340 --> 04:22:46,200
Holy shit.

6397
04:22:51,420 --> 04:22:52,300
The fucking...

6398
04:22:52,300 --> 04:22:54,200
Yeah, I don't think that's the same Icy.

6399
04:22:57,620 --> 04:22:58,060
Widow.

6400
04:22:59,740 --> 04:23:00,180
Ooh.

6401
04:23:00,600 --> 04:23:03,560
Ooh, King ending the game on the best map in the game.

6402
04:23:03,580 --> 04:23:04,240
I think that's the best map in Overwatch.

6403
04:23:04,680 --> 04:23:05,520
That's great.

6404
04:23:05,680 --> 04:23:06,440
I like that.

6405
04:23:06,760 --> 04:23:08,660
I like that they're ending it here.

6406
04:23:08,980 --> 04:23:10,080
I love...

6407
04:23:10,080 --> 04:23:11,640
I love...

6408
04:23:11,640 --> 04:23:13,940
Oh, that's fucking shit.

6409
04:23:14,440 --> 04:23:15,720
They have...

6410
04:23:18,500 --> 04:23:20,440
This is bad because they have Ana.

6411
04:23:23,280 --> 04:23:23,900
Woo!

6412
04:23:25,880 --> 04:23:26,500
Mora!

6413
04:23:26,860 --> 04:23:28,120
What are you doing, Mora?

6414
04:23:30,380 --> 04:23:31,000
Goodbye.

6415
04:23:31,800 --> 04:23:32,420
Goodbye.

6416
04:23:33,960 --> 04:23:34,560
Woo!

6417
04:23:36,800 --> 04:23:38,980
Somebody do something about the tank!

6418
04:23:40,240 --> 04:23:40,840
Nice.

6419
04:23:43,140 --> 04:23:43,740
Yes!

6420
04:23:45,600 --> 04:23:46,320
That's right.

6421
04:23:46,400 --> 04:23:47,020
You can't do shit.

6422
04:23:49,780 --> 04:23:50,380
Nice.

6423
04:23:51,680 --> 04:23:56,240
Sucks for this Rein because usually the tanks will do like an honorable Rein 1v1.

6424
04:23:56,520 --> 04:23:59,240
But like our waffle man is not honorable.

6425
04:23:59,680 --> 04:24:00,540
You can tell.

6426
04:24:00,740 --> 04:24:01,740
Oh, they swapped off.

6427
04:24:02,800 --> 04:24:03,560
Swapped off.

6428
04:24:03,580 --> 04:24:04,740
Swapped off Widow, which is nice.

6429
04:24:04,880 --> 04:24:05,680
So I can...

6430
04:24:05,680 --> 04:24:07,600
I don't have to worry about peeking.

6431
04:24:08,160 --> 04:24:09,760
Now I can peek forever.

6432
04:24:10,300 --> 04:24:10,360
Oh!

6433
04:24:12,920 --> 04:24:14,120
All right.

6434
04:24:14,160 --> 04:24:14,660
That sucks.

6435
04:24:17,140 --> 04:24:18,080
Oh, he's one!

6436
04:24:18,140 --> 04:24:18,500
He's one!

6437
04:24:19,360 --> 04:24:19,960
One!

6438
04:24:20,360 --> 04:24:20,660
Okay.

6439
04:24:25,290 --> 04:24:27,430
Where did he come from?

6440
04:24:32,170 --> 04:24:33,370
Holy shit!

6441
04:24:34,150 --> 04:24:34,590
I...

6442
04:24:34,590 --> 04:24:35,250
What?

6443
04:24:36,330 --> 04:24:36,930
Okay.

6444
04:24:36,930 --> 04:24:38,710
That's a good Alari player.

6445
04:24:39,130 --> 04:24:40,830
Oh my God!

6446
04:24:41,310 --> 04:24:43,650
Where the fuck did he come from?

6447
04:24:43,650 --> 04:24:45,250
He jump scared me!

6448
04:24:47,090 --> 04:24:48,410
Actual jump scare.

6449
04:24:48,710 --> 04:24:50,210
He has shatter soon.

6450
04:24:51,890 --> 04:24:52,790
Gotta go on.

6451
04:24:54,570 --> 04:24:55,770
I'm gonna...

6452
04:25:01,040 --> 04:25:01,880
Oh God.

6453
04:25:05,620 --> 04:25:06,140
Oh God.

6454
04:25:06,200 --> 04:25:07,100
We lost the doom though.

6455
04:25:07,140 --> 04:25:07,580
We got...

6456
04:25:09,240 --> 04:25:10,860
We need to get on point.

6457
04:25:11,160 --> 04:25:11,380
No!

6458
04:25:11,380 --> 04:25:12,560
We got the exact point!

6459
04:25:14,120 --> 04:25:14,640
Please!

6460
04:25:15,300 --> 04:25:16,900
Do we not have ult?

6461
04:25:17,160 --> 04:25:18,640
Oh, Ashe did not have ult.

6462
04:25:19,000 --> 04:25:19,940
Yeah, nevermind.

6463
04:25:20,400 --> 04:25:21,980
Ashe did not have ult.

6464
04:25:25,220 --> 04:25:26,260
Holy shit.

6465
04:25:31,220 --> 04:25:32,440
That could be me.

6466
04:25:32,600 --> 04:25:33,360
That could be me.

6467
04:25:33,620 --> 04:25:34,840
That Alari is insane.

6468
04:25:35,280 --> 04:25:35,820
This is what I mean.

6469
04:25:36,060 --> 04:25:37,300
We do have a good Alari.

6470
04:25:37,580 --> 04:25:38,560
Or a...

6471
04:25:38,560 --> 04:25:40,700
A good Alari can fucking carry.

6472
04:25:40,700 --> 04:25:42,600
We do have a good Alari and...

6473
04:25:42,600 --> 04:25:43,540
Or a good tank player.

6474
04:25:44,600 --> 04:25:45,820
Doesn't matter what role you are.

6475
04:25:46,060 --> 04:25:47,160
We can carry so hard.

6476
04:25:48,460 --> 04:25:49,780
Or you can climb so hard.

6477
04:25:52,900 --> 04:25:54,620
Maybe I should have nano the doom.

6478
04:25:54,820 --> 04:25:56,480
I just went with the first person I see.

6479
04:25:56,700 --> 04:25:57,280
I see!

6480
04:25:57,380 --> 04:25:59,120
If you're gonna be, I fucking...

6481
04:25:59,740 --> 04:26:00,420
Fuck off.

6482
04:26:02,320 --> 04:26:03,260
Actually, fuck off.

6483
04:26:07,280 --> 04:26:07,680
Guys!

6484
04:26:08,120 --> 04:26:09,220
I told you!

6485
04:26:09,480 --> 04:26:10,620
I told you!

6486
04:26:10,620 --> 04:26:10,680
I told you!

6487
04:26:12,540 --> 04:26:13,720
I can sleep!

6488
04:26:16,340 --> 04:26:18,720
I told you, I can sleep.

6489
04:26:26,260 --> 04:26:27,380
Oh, he missed.

6490
04:26:28,780 --> 04:26:29,460
Ashe?

6491
04:26:29,860 --> 04:26:30,520
Ashe?

6492
04:26:31,600 --> 04:26:33,900
You're lucky I'm fucking pre-healing you.

6493
04:26:34,080 --> 04:26:34,760
Ashe?

6494
04:26:37,200 --> 04:26:37,920
Alright, Ashe!

6495
04:26:39,140 --> 04:26:40,920
I'm fucking leaving, Ashe.

6496
04:26:41,300 --> 04:26:43,220
I'm gonna heal somebody else.

6497
04:26:50,160 --> 04:26:52,000
That was a good decision by me.

6498
04:26:54,420 --> 04:26:59,120
Told you guys I can... I know how to fucking... I know how to sleep!

6499
04:27:01,060 --> 04:27:02,480
Bro, is this kid?

6500
04:27:02,700 --> 04:27:03,580
That's a child!

6501
04:27:05,040 --> 04:27:05,880
Or a girl.

6502
04:27:07,900 --> 04:27:09,220
Suddenly... I can't tell.

6503
04:27:13,790 --> 04:27:14,730
I couldn't tell.

6504
04:27:14,910 --> 04:27:15,710
Was that a child?

6505
04:27:16,010 --> 04:27:16,850
I can't tell!

6506
04:27:16,970 --> 04:27:17,550
Oh, that's a widow.

6507
04:27:20,810 --> 04:27:21,330
Okay.

6508
04:27:21,730 --> 04:27:23,250
You gotta come over here.

6509
04:27:25,010 --> 04:27:26,030
Maybe both.

6510
04:27:26,110 --> 04:27:26,510
Could be.

6511
04:27:32,410 --> 04:27:33,190
Oh god.

6512
04:27:33,530 --> 04:27:34,270
Oh god.

6513
04:27:34,550 --> 04:27:35,330
Oh god!

6514
04:27:35,790 --> 04:27:36,310
Please!

6515
04:27:36,310 --> 04:27:36,710
He's won!

6516
04:27:38,250 --> 04:27:39,150
He's won!

6517
04:27:39,390 --> 04:27:39,730
No!

6518
04:27:44,820 --> 04:27:46,240
It sounded like a child!

6519
04:27:50,080 --> 04:27:52,780
Hello... Hello... I think he started saying... Hello, Mora?

6520
04:27:54,280 --> 04:27:55,260
I think he was.

6521
04:27:55,640 --> 04:27:56,640
I think...

6522
04:27:58,340 --> 04:27:59,960
It would have been so sick.

6523
04:28:00,280 --> 04:28:01,380
Heal the headshot?

6524
04:28:01,560 --> 04:28:02,120
I can't.

6525
04:28:02,660 --> 04:28:03,140
Okay, no.

6526
04:28:03,260 --> 04:28:03,800
It's not a child.

6527
04:28:04,540 --> 04:28:07,220
You get a headshot, I can't heal that, bro.

6528
04:28:12,020 --> 04:28:13,020
Never mind.

6529
04:28:13,140 --> 04:28:13,820
Not a child.

6530
04:28:14,340 --> 04:28:15,300
Not a child.

6531
04:28:16,180 --> 04:28:17,460
Just a southern accent.

6532
04:28:20,160 --> 04:28:21,340
Definitely not a child.

6533
04:28:25,920 --> 04:28:26,460
Bro.

6534
04:28:28,160 --> 04:28:29,600
Oh my god.

6535
04:28:40,200 --> 04:28:40,740
No!

6536
04:28:40,740 --> 04:28:41,780
I jumped!

6537
04:28:42,320 --> 04:28:43,240
I jumped!

6538
04:28:44,800 --> 04:28:45,620
Never mind.

6539
04:28:45,820 --> 04:28:46,600
It's a woman.

6540
04:28:47,380 --> 04:28:47,780
Sorry.

6541
04:28:47,820 --> 04:28:51,320
I thought that was a child, but the southern accent threw me off.

6542
04:28:51,460 --> 04:28:52,180
You're laughing at my heart at that moment.

6543
04:28:55,980 --> 04:28:58,620
The southern accent threw me off, that's for sure.

6544
04:29:01,060 --> 04:29:02,420
Oh my...

6545
04:29:02,420 --> 04:29:03,260
Alright.

6546
04:29:03,560 --> 04:29:04,840
Not peeking the widow!

6547
04:29:06,060 --> 04:29:07,460
Don't peek the widow!

6548
04:29:08,920 --> 04:29:10,300
Don't peek the widow!

6549
04:29:14,170 --> 04:29:14,850
Oh!

6550
04:29:15,270 --> 04:29:17,310
This is where our Ramatra dies.

6551
04:29:18,150 --> 04:29:18,830
Unless...

6552
04:29:19,730 --> 04:29:21,590
This is where our Ramatra dies.

6553
04:29:21,590 --> 04:29:24,790
This is definitely where our Ramatra...

6554
04:29:24,790 --> 04:29:26,250
This is...

6555
04:29:26,250 --> 04:29:29,430
This is 100% where we...

6556
04:29:29,430 --> 04:29:30,610
Where he dies.

6557
04:29:30,970 --> 04:29:32,470
Nothing can save him.

6558
04:29:36,350 --> 04:29:38,190
Oh my god!

6559
04:29:42,690 --> 04:29:43,430
Goodbye.

6560
04:29:44,250 --> 04:29:44,990
Goodbye.

6561
04:29:46,230 --> 04:29:47,530
I stay here.

6562
04:29:50,430 --> 04:29:52,710
Holy shit, he's taking so much damage.

6563
04:29:54,230 --> 04:29:57,070
We are trying our fucking best here.

6564
04:29:57,650 --> 04:29:59,170
Alright, go Waffle!

6565
04:29:59,350 --> 04:29:59,710
Go!

6566
04:30:00,530 --> 04:30:01,170
Jesus.

6567
04:30:01,590 --> 04:30:01,910
Jesus.

6568
04:30:02,670 --> 04:30:02,990
Okay.

6569
04:30:04,590 --> 04:30:05,690
Go Waffle!

6570
04:30:05,830 --> 04:30:06,070
Go!

6571
04:30:11,900 --> 04:30:12,860
What the fuck?

6572
04:30:13,960 --> 04:30:17,280
He's actually won!

6573
04:30:17,380 --> 04:30:17,920
I swear to god!

6574
04:30:21,460 --> 04:30:23,420
Where did he come from?

6575
04:30:23,420 --> 04:30:25,100
Where the fuck...

6576
04:30:27,340 --> 04:30:29,580
Where the fuck did Waffle come...

6577
04:30:29,580 --> 04:30:30,380
Not Waffle.

6578
04:30:30,560 --> 04:30:31,900
The Hanzo come from.

6579
04:30:33,060 --> 04:30:34,800
Dude, double sniper is so scary.

6580
04:30:37,040 --> 04:30:38,500
Is he still double sniper?

6581
04:30:38,660 --> 04:30:39,360
Okay, thank god.

6582
04:30:39,500 --> 04:30:39,700
Okay.

6583
04:30:40,150 --> 04:30:42,900
Single sniper feels a lot more manageable though.

6584
04:30:43,720 --> 04:30:44,300
Oh!

6585
04:30:44,840 --> 04:30:45,420
Oh!

6586
04:30:45,980 --> 04:30:47,960
Oh, and he just died!

6587
04:30:48,880 --> 04:30:49,460
Oh!

6588
04:30:50,220 --> 04:30:53,100
Off I go into the world of fucking...

6589
04:30:53,100 --> 04:30:53,880
Cover.

6590
04:30:54,900 --> 04:30:55,340
Whoa!

6591
04:30:56,120 --> 04:30:57,380
Other Widow's dead, we don't have to run.

6592
04:30:58,400 --> 04:31:00,660
We still... What do you mean we still need to run?

6593
04:31:03,460 --> 04:31:03,900
Okay.

6594
04:31:05,100 --> 04:31:06,200
It's... It's even.

6595
04:31:11,340 --> 04:31:13,280
Alright, there's nothing I can do with that.

6596
04:31:21,700 --> 04:31:22,140
Jeez.

6597
04:31:22,140 --> 04:31:22,580
Please.

6598
04:31:22,760 --> 04:31:23,200
Please.

6599
04:31:23,600 --> 04:31:24,040
Please.

6600
04:31:25,960 --> 04:31:26,660
Please, Madison.

6601
04:31:27,000 --> 04:31:27,440
Please.

6602
04:31:28,060 --> 04:31:28,500
Please.

6603
04:31:28,600 --> 04:31:30,420
I'm trying to pick you up right now.

6604
04:31:31,140 --> 04:31:31,620
Please.

6605
04:31:32,680 --> 04:31:33,880
Oh my god, live.

6606
04:31:34,540 --> 04:31:35,520
Live for me!

6607
04:31:37,420 --> 04:31:38,160
It's over!

6608
04:31:40,480 --> 04:31:41,160
It's okay.

6609
04:31:42,040 --> 04:31:43,520
We can push that far!

6610
04:31:45,280 --> 04:31:45,760
Right?

6611
04:31:46,700 --> 04:31:47,600
It's manageable!

6612
04:31:48,580 --> 04:31:50,420
Guys, in two hours I have the meeting.

6613
04:31:52,860 --> 04:31:55,340
I think I played Overwatch a little bit too long.

6614
04:31:56,440 --> 04:31:56,920
I was like...

6615
04:32:00,440 --> 04:32:01,100
I was like...

6616
04:32:01,100 --> 04:32:03,320
I was not supposed to play Overwatch this long, but I couldn't help it.

6617
04:32:06,530 --> 04:32:07,570
It was just so fun.

6618
04:32:07,950 --> 04:32:08,530
Hey, guys!

6619
04:32:08,670 --> 04:32:09,790
I cancelled the round out!

6620
04:32:10,010 --> 04:32:10,410
Okay?

6621
04:32:10,790 --> 04:32:11,610
I literally...

6622
04:32:11,610 --> 04:32:13,170
I'm gonna avoid this moral play forever.

6623
04:32:13,510 --> 04:32:13,990
It doesn't matter.

6624
04:32:14,370 --> 04:32:16,110
One trick should not exist in this game.

6625
04:32:17,170 --> 04:32:21,530
I'm gonna avoid her so that in the future I don't bump into this person.

6626
04:32:25,930 --> 04:32:29,330
It doesn't matter if, like, she's good or not.

6627
04:32:29,670 --> 04:32:30,830
She's still a one trick.

6628
04:32:30,830 --> 04:32:31,970
I hate one tricks.

6629
04:32:33,990 --> 04:32:40,710
This game has evolved to the point where one tricks should not exist anymore.

6630
04:32:40,950 --> 04:32:41,870
We wanna win.

6631
04:32:43,990 --> 04:32:45,490
Yeah, but I might be playing tomorrow.

6632
04:32:45,770 --> 04:32:47,590
I'm trying to end Top 500 this season.

6633
04:32:51,110 --> 04:32:51,630
Yay!

6634
04:32:53,190 --> 04:32:54,810
Isn't it the only sleep you've hit?

6635
04:32:54,970 --> 04:32:56,910
That was the sleep that mattered!

6636
04:32:58,370 --> 04:32:59,350
It doesn't matter.

6637
04:32:59,350 --> 04:33:00,310
It ma- No!

6638
04:33:00,410 --> 04:33:01,550
I slept two people!

6639
04:33:01,630 --> 04:33:03,970
I literally have stats on my screen!

6640
04:33:04,210 --> 04:33:06,090
You can't fucking gaslight me.

6641
04:33:06,190 --> 04:33:07,650
There's literally numbers on my screen.

6642
04:33:07,930 --> 04:33:10,150
Ooh, that's a really good anti though.

6643
04:33:10,490 --> 04:33:11,450
Let's move out!

6644
04:33:11,570 --> 04:33:11,990
Alright.

6645
04:33:13,390 --> 04:33:14,350
That's a good ana.

6646
04:33:14,530 --> 04:33:16,670
Because he knows his, um, maid.

6647
04:33:17,270 --> 04:33:20,110
I see a lot of fucking maid players right now.

6648
04:33:20,450 --> 04:33:21,010
Guys!

6649
04:33:21,090 --> 04:33:22,170
Break the wall!

6650
04:33:22,710 --> 04:33:27,530
I should not be the only one shooting that wall.

6651
04:33:28,590 --> 04:33:29,070
Like...

6652
04:33:31,530 --> 04:33:33,830
I actually should not be the only one.

6653
04:33:33,910 --> 04:33:34,210
Please.

6654
04:33:34,350 --> 04:33:35,750
Oh, come on!

6655
04:33:40,370 --> 04:33:40,850
God.

6656
04:33:40,970 --> 04:33:42,210
No, I had to reload!

6657
04:33:43,990 --> 04:33:45,070
I'm so unlucky!

6658
04:33:45,630 --> 04:33:47,130
I literally had to reload!

6659
04:33:56,300 --> 04:33:58,520
Yeah, but they do have an ana, so...

6660
04:33:58,520 --> 04:34:00,020
It's like, it's a little risky.

6661
04:34:01,180 --> 04:34:02,460
Ooh, he's shooting me.

6662
04:34:03,180 --> 04:34:03,740
So...

6663
04:34:09,880 --> 04:34:11,580
Oh, I thought he'd be there!

6664
04:34:12,120 --> 04:34:13,120
Bad prediction.

6665
04:34:16,220 --> 04:34:16,780
No!

6666
04:34:17,520 --> 04:34:18,360
Oh, nice!

6667
04:34:19,580 --> 04:34:21,200
Oh, no, that's not nice!

6668
04:34:21,260 --> 04:34:21,640
Not nice!

6669
04:34:25,020 --> 04:34:25,580
Nice!

6670
04:34:25,760 --> 04:34:26,500
Nice again!

6671
04:34:27,600 --> 04:34:28,480
Not nice!

6672
04:34:33,270 --> 04:34:34,290
Not nice!

6673
04:34:35,290 --> 04:34:36,710
Not nice at all!

6674
04:34:37,710 --> 04:34:39,210
Why did nobody die?

6675
04:34:39,230 --> 04:34:40,630
He got back to help me!

6676
04:34:40,810 --> 04:34:42,230
What the fuck?!

6677
04:34:42,790 --> 04:34:44,870
Nobody came back!

6678
04:34:45,230 --> 04:34:46,630
Am I not...

6679
04:34:46,630 --> 04:34:48,270
Am I not important?!

6680
04:34:50,700 --> 04:34:52,600
Nobody came back for me.

6681
04:34:53,360 --> 04:34:56,640
Literally a fucking tank ran at me!

6682
04:34:57,400 --> 04:34:59,980
And he forgot about me!

6683
04:35:01,820 --> 04:35:03,720
That's so fucked up.

6684
04:35:03,960 --> 04:35:06,420
That's actually so fucked up.

6685
04:35:08,320 --> 04:35:09,740
Their ana is really good though.

6686
04:35:09,740 --> 04:35:12,540
Because like I said, they know like me, loadouts.

6687
04:35:12,540 --> 04:35:14,740
SOMEONE PLEASE SHOOT THE ICE!

6688
04:35:15,140 --> 04:35:18,260
We have 2 TPS that can't shoot ice blocks!

6689
04:35:19,860 --> 04:35:21,180
Who's gonna nano the Bob?

6690
04:35:26,470 --> 04:35:27,590
Who froze?

6691
04:35:28,110 --> 04:35:28,670
Nobody.

6692
04:35:29,310 --> 04:35:29,870
Okay.

6693
04:35:32,790 --> 04:35:34,270
Do we have a Bob?

6694
04:35:34,430 --> 04:35:35,830
Do we have a Bob?

6695
04:35:36,130 --> 04:35:38,130
Do we have a Bob?

6696
04:35:43,380 --> 04:35:45,300
Do we have a Bob?

6697
04:35:47,120 --> 04:35:48,480
FINE GUYS!

6698
04:35:49,240 --> 04:35:49,620
I...

6699
04:35:51,020 --> 04:35:53,780
Guys, how can 3 people just not shoot her?

6700
04:35:53,920 --> 04:35:54,600
I...

6701
04:35:55,380 --> 04:35:55,760
I...

6702
04:35:55,760 --> 04:35:56,940
Look at their HP!

6703
04:35:57,220 --> 04:35:58,420
No, our team's...

6704
04:35:58,420 --> 04:35:59,420
Oh my...

6705
04:35:59,420 --> 04:36:00,360
Guys, I...

6706
04:36:05,620 --> 04:36:07,140
I can't...

6707
04:36:07,140 --> 04:36:07,560
I...

6708
04:36:07,560 --> 04:36:08,280
Let's see...

6709
04:36:08,280 --> 04:36:09,160
I...

6710
04:36:09,560 --> 04:36:09,940
I...

6711
04:36:10,660 --> 04:36:14,080
I don't understand how our team did not kill the Mei.

6712
04:36:14,300 --> 04:36:14,920
I...

6713
04:36:14,920 --> 04:36:18,420
I don't understand!

6714
04:36:18,920 --> 04:36:21,180
That was...

6715
04:36:21,180 --> 04:36:21,900
I...

6716
04:36:21,900 --> 04:36:25,400
I saw the kill feed and that should not have happened.

6717
04:36:26,900 --> 04:36:30,080
Her HP was not going down fast enough.

6718
04:36:33,400 --> 04:36:34,680
Holy shit!

6719
04:36:34,880 --> 04:36:36,600
My god, this is the last game.

6720
04:36:36,880 --> 04:36:37,320
I...

6721
04:36:37,940 --> 04:36:38,280
No!

6722
04:36:38,380 --> 04:36:39,620
Why would you not...

6723
04:36:40,460 --> 04:36:40,820
The wall!

6724
04:36:43,460 --> 04:36:44,500
I can't...

6725
04:36:44,500 --> 04:36:45,600
I can't this game.

6726
04:36:45,820 --> 04:36:46,680
He has ult.

6727
04:36:46,800 --> 04:36:47,960
The row mantra has ult.

6728
04:36:48,660 --> 04:36:50,340
I can't this game, man.

6729
04:36:50,480 --> 04:36:50,720
I...

6730
04:36:51,100 --> 04:36:52,340
I actually can't.

6731
04:36:57,140 --> 04:36:58,000
Oh god.

6732
04:36:58,800 --> 04:36:59,360
Please.

6733
04:37:00,300 --> 04:37:00,660
Oh...

6734
04:37:01,080 --> 04:37:03,900
The only reason I use it is to keep you alive.

6735
04:37:06,280 --> 04:37:07,000
Oh god.

6736
04:37:09,180 --> 04:37:09,740
Oh...

6737
04:37:09,740 --> 04:37:10,380
Come on.

6738
04:37:14,780 --> 04:37:15,440
Oh...

6739
04:37:15,440 --> 04:37:16,480
Oh come on.

6740
04:37:19,940 --> 04:37:21,260
Come on!

6741
04:37:21,260 --> 04:37:23,460
Oh fuck this team.

6742
04:37:23,800 --> 04:37:30,180
This team is very special because it is my team.

6743
04:37:33,300 --> 04:37:39,660
I feel like I should go Kiriko for the cleanse, but like I feel like we definitely need that Ana.

6744
04:37:40,640 --> 04:37:41,620
Are you...

6745
04:37:41,620 --> 04:37:42,260
He's one.

6746
04:37:42,640 --> 04:37:43,840
He's one.

6747
04:37:44,420 --> 04:37:45,820
He's so low.

6748
04:37:46,040 --> 04:37:46,520
I see.

6749
04:37:47,700 --> 04:37:48,500
Oh god.

6750
04:37:50,960 --> 04:37:51,520
Thirsty.

6751
04:37:51,520 --> 04:37:52,080
Please.

6752
04:37:52,500 --> 04:37:53,280
Hanzo, please.

6753
04:37:56,950 --> 04:37:58,070
Oh my god.

6754
04:37:59,210 --> 04:38:02,090
I feel like we definitely need...

6755
04:38:03,090 --> 04:38:05,210
We need the fucking... Please don't stand there.

6756
04:38:05,310 --> 04:38:06,290
Please, they have a Widow.

6757
04:38:06,350 --> 04:38:06,770
Please.

6758
04:38:06,770 --> 04:38:07,570
Please.

6759
04:38:07,570 --> 04:38:09,030
I do not... Please.

6760
04:38:09,230 --> 04:38:10,350
They have a Widow.

6761
04:38:10,390 --> 04:38:13,010
I do not feel good of you standing there like that.

6762
04:38:13,590 --> 04:38:15,430
It makes me so uncomfortable.

6763
04:38:17,470 --> 04:38:18,830
He has ult too.

6764
04:38:19,970 --> 04:38:22,630
Oh, he's so low but... Oh, he ulted him.

6765
04:38:25,050 --> 04:38:26,370
He has ult.

6766
04:38:26,410 --> 04:38:27,410
The Reaper has ult.

6767
04:38:27,490 --> 04:38:28,470
I can feel it.

6768
04:38:29,270 --> 04:38:31,290
He has ult too?!

6769
04:38:35,090 --> 04:38:35,650
Please.

6770
04:38:36,210 --> 04:38:38,310
Where the fuck is the Reaper?!

6771
04:38:38,330 --> 04:38:39,530
Oh, he's back there.

6772
04:38:40,150 --> 04:38:40,550
Alright.

6773
04:38:40,790 --> 04:38:41,410
He's gone.

6774
04:38:42,530 --> 04:38:43,050
Reaper's gone.

6775
04:38:43,410 --> 04:38:43,630
Whoa!

6776
04:38:48,570 --> 04:38:49,910
What is this patch?!

6777
04:38:49,910 --> 04:38:53,090
What is the patch that he's mad about?!

6778
04:38:53,090 --> 04:38:54,330
Which one is it?!

6779
04:38:59,940 --> 04:39:01,740
Thing is, I don't know what he's mad about.

6780
04:39:01,980 --> 04:39:03,040
I don't know which patch.

6781
04:39:03,220 --> 04:39:05,320
There's so many things to be mad about but I don't know which one.

6782
04:39:09,140 --> 04:39:10,720
I don't want to look at him.

6783
04:39:12,420 --> 04:39:14,340
Oh, they're going Hog Counters now.

6784
04:39:16,020 --> 04:39:18,360
Oh, they went Maga!

6785
04:39:19,880 --> 04:39:21,680
Oh, they won a win.

6786
04:39:24,040 --> 04:39:24,820
Let's fuck it.

6787
04:39:26,660 --> 04:39:28,280
Get this Maga out of our game.

6788
04:39:28,700 --> 04:39:29,900
Get him out of our game, please.

6789
04:39:29,960 --> 04:39:30,640
That's all I want.

6790
04:39:30,700 --> 04:39:31,960
Get this guy out of our game.

6791
04:39:32,140 --> 04:39:33,020
Get him out!

6792
04:39:42,280 --> 04:39:42,720
Okay.

6793
04:39:43,940 --> 04:39:44,380
Okay.

6794
04:39:48,060 --> 04:39:48,780
Yay!

6795
04:39:52,060 --> 04:39:53,120
That's fucky, right?

6796
04:39:53,720 --> 04:39:55,760
Sleep to win that on.

6797
04:40:01,980 --> 04:40:05,620
That Reaper waited his entire life for that ult.

6798
04:40:05,960 --> 04:40:08,300
That's so... That's where he came from?!

6799
04:40:09,460 --> 04:40:11,840
The sleep that mattered, baby.

6800
04:40:12,260 --> 04:40:17,280
He waited his entire... He kept that sleep for so fucking long.

6801
04:40:19,700 --> 04:40:21,700
Making GG's dogshit Reaper.

6802
04:40:23,220 --> 04:40:24,960
I wonder if that's something I play in the game.

6803
04:40:25,120 --> 04:40:25,880
I hope it is.

6804
04:40:26,040 --> 04:40:26,280
Okay.

6805
04:40:26,860 --> 04:40:27,260
History.

6806
04:40:28,240 --> 04:40:28,740
King's Row.

6807
04:40:29,180 --> 04:40:29,880
I want to see that.

6808
04:40:29,940 --> 04:40:30,240
Oh, no.

6809
04:40:30,300 --> 04:40:30,700
Not save.

6810
04:40:30,920 --> 04:40:31,760
I want to...

6811
04:40:32,760 --> 04:40:33,780
I want to see that.

6812
04:40:37,250 --> 04:40:38,170
Ended on a win.

6813
04:40:39,050 --> 04:40:42,050
Is it... Is that... Hello, CF Cogar.

6814
04:40:44,230 --> 04:40:44,970
It is.

6815
04:40:47,450 --> 04:40:48,550
Embarrassing for the Reaper.

6816
04:40:51,170 --> 04:40:52,050
So embarrassing.

6817
04:40:56,370 --> 04:40:57,250
Holy shit.

6818
04:40:57,470 --> 04:41:00,050
That shit is so embarrassing for him.

6819
04:41:03,690 --> 04:41:04,570
Rip Bozo.

6820
04:41:04,650 --> 04:41:05,290
That was fun.

6821
04:41:05,490 --> 04:41:06,090
I had a fun time.

6822
04:41:06,870 --> 04:41:07,550
We're up.

6823
04:41:07,710 --> 04:41:08,210
We're up.

6824
04:41:08,290 --> 04:41:10,430
I think I need like one game and I'd be Master 4.

6825
04:41:10,710 --> 04:41:11,370
But we're up.

6826
04:41:11,550 --> 04:41:13,550
I mean, it's pretty good for solo queue, honestly.

6827
04:41:13,550 --> 04:41:18,970
Like, for solo queue in general, that's like pretty good for me.

6828
04:41:20,170 --> 04:41:22,290
Being up is always good, guys.

6829
04:41:22,370 --> 04:41:24,510
No matter what, as long as you're like...

6830
04:41:24,510 --> 04:41:28,710
As long as you're positive in your climb, that's all that matters.

6831
04:41:28,790 --> 04:41:29,550
So I'm happy.

6832
04:41:29,810 --> 04:41:31,710
I'm happy that we're positive in the climb.

6833
04:41:34,250 --> 04:41:36,810
Yeah, just one... I was... I did have a lot of fun.

6834
04:41:36,950 --> 04:41:38,470
I always have a lot of fun when I'm streaming rank.

6835
04:41:38,550 --> 04:41:39,670
Not when I'm like...

6836
04:41:39,670 --> 04:41:40,910
I mean, I do have fun off stream.

6837
04:41:41,050 --> 04:41:42,210
It's because I don't take it as seriously.

6838
04:41:42,210 --> 04:41:43,670
I don't take it as seriously anymore.

6839
04:41:43,890 --> 04:41:45,810
So like, it's only when I'm like...

6840
04:41:47,010 --> 04:41:49,270
It's only when I take it super seriously that I don't have fun.

6841
04:41:50,850 --> 04:41:57,630
But streaming rank, playing it, and streaming for you guys, I definitely enjoyed it a lot.

6842
04:41:58,370 --> 04:41:59,790
Alright, I'm gonna head off now.

6843
04:41:59,830 --> 04:42:01,330
But thank you everybody for watching!

6844
04:42:01,690 --> 04:42:05,510
Tomorrow we have Marvel Rivals, so we can compare directly to Overwatch.

6845
04:42:06,490 --> 04:42:09,530
And they are releasing a couple of new characters for the closed beta.

6846
04:42:09,810 --> 04:42:12,190
So it's gonna be fun to see.

6847
04:42:13,310 --> 04:42:14,930
I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

6848
04:42:15,210 --> 04:42:19,910
As always, everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6849
04:42:20,070 --> 04:42:22,190
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

6850
04:42:22,310 --> 04:42:23,490
Because you deserve it!

6851
04:42:23,610 --> 04:42:24,510
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6852
04:42:25,050 --> 04:42:25,710
Bye, guys!

6853
04:42:26,150 --> 04:42:26,550
Bye!
