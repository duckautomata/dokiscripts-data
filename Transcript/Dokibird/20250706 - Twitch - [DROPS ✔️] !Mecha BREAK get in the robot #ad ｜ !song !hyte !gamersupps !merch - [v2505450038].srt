1
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,260
Wow!

2
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,140
Hello!

3
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,920
Hello, everybody!

4
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Welcome to another day of Mechabreak!

5
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,780
Alright, let me get the game out.

6
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,580
Alright, so, I forgot to save the sound settings for Mechabreak.

7
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,360
And I don't know if my sound team are alive right now.

8
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,320
That's the only issue.

9
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,200
So, I guess we're gonna freestyle it.

10
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Wait, unless...

11
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,940
It's staff... I could get the other... I could get the other staff team to help me out.

12
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,840
The other mod team.

13
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,460
Um, this is your time to shine, staff team!

14
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,660
That aren't... Oh, wait, no, no.

15
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,100
Never mind.

16
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,600
Never mind.

17
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,460
We have a sound guy that's alive.

18
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,220
Never mind.

19
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,480
JK, you're not promoted, mod team!

20
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,420
You're not...

21
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,960
JK!

22
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,220
We have... We have someone alive.

23
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,420
I see them typing.

24
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,340
They're like, I just woke up.

25
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,340
Give me a minute.

26
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,420
Promotion denied.

27
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,780
With no... It's okay.

28
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,700
It's those type of promotions where you get a fancier title, but you don't get paid any extra work.

29
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,320
You do extra work, but you just don't get paid for it.

30
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,540
You just get the title.

31
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,760
Hello, everybody!

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,420
Hello, and welcome to another stream for Mechabreak.

33
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,000
For those who are new here, this is a sponsored stream.

34
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,020
I am sponsored by Mechabreak.

35
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,560
They asked me to stream one more.

36
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:40,420
Um, I... I was gonna do two streams, but I'll be doing another stream after this stream on Tuesday for Mechabreak.

37
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,320
Um, because they enjoyed... They enjoyed the first stream, so they asked me to do an extra one, um, to promote the game.

38
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,240
And the Mechabreak has been really fun!

39
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,100
Um, I actually, uh, I... I wish I did have time to, like, actually, like, play around with all the other characters.

40
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,980
But legitimately, after the first Mechabreak stream, it was just work, work, work, work, work, until the birthday stuff.

41
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,420
And then I did not exist as a person yesterday.

42
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,340
Other than the Chibi-Doki collab, I was not, like, like, existing at all.

43
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,620
I just, like, right after the collab, I, like, I, like, it was, like, offline mode.

44
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,960
You can tell, because I still have yet to...

45
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,200
I still have yet to tweet out anything related to my birthday stuff.

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,060
So, like, you know, my new outfit references, I haven't even tweeted that out.

47
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,800
I haven't even tweeted out the birthday kick.

48
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,300
I haven't tweeted out any thank you tweets yet.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,580
Um, I'm so out of it.

50
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,560
I've been awake since 9, 9.30 a.m.

51
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,140
Because I had to do my meet and greets at Anime Expo.

52
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,360
And, um, and also, like, uh, you know, doing this sponsored stream today, too.

53
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,140
But Monday, there will be no stream.

54
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,660
Anyway, guys, uh, for those who don't know what Mechabreak is, it is a third-person hero shooter.

55
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,100
I mean, it has, like, three different game modes.

56
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,100
But, uh, it's a third-person Mecha shooter.

57
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,140
And, um, and basically, there's three game modes.

58
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,100
It's Extraction, uh, 6v6 hero shooter, and, uh, 3v3 deathmatch.

59
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,020
And there's, like, 12 characters that you can pick right now.

60
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,300
And then it's free to play, guys.

61
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,120
This is free to play.

62
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:28,400
So, if you do exclamation point Mecha or see the pinned, uh, the pinned, uh, comment in, uh, the chat, uh, you can actually download it right now for free.

63
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,900
And, you know, play the game.

64
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,180
I'm gonna be doing a few custom lobbies later on.

65
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,840
Um, I think, like, at the last hour or so.

66
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,940
Um, because this will be a two-hour stream.

67
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,320
Um, and the first hour, I'll be playing the, um, you know, the quick play, the 3v3, and the regular.

68
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,220
I think a lot of people, I think people actually know how to play now.

69
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,860
So, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure, um, a lot of people know how to play this game now.

70
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,060
So, it's gonna be a lot difficult.

71
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,520
So, I can't get away with stuff these days.

72
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,900
Yeah, so, yeah, I'm not playing extraction.

73
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Because, uh, I personally don't like extraction game modes in general.

74
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,720
Like, it doesn't matter what game that tries to do extraction mode for me.

75
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,120
I'm not, like, a huge extraction player.

76
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:21,040
Um, I, if I had to choose between, like, extraction, uh, hero shooter, or, like, 3v3, um, I would obviously go for it.

77
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,300
Like, because there's so many choices.

78
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,820
There's three game choices and everything.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,900
So, that's why I'll go with, um, hero shooter.

80
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,840
But if you are an extraction player, I heard the extraction game mode is, like, pretty fun.

81
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,800
So, of course, you guys can check it out as well.

82
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,980
Um, uh, Nurukami.

83
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,700
Bro, I still love, I love Nurukami.

84
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,820
Nurukami is, like, such a fun character to play.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,040
I should try the other characters, but I feel like they're not as good as Nurukami.

86
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,620
The heavy sniper?

87
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh, okay.

88
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll see what the heavy sniper is.

89
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,860
And someone's like, and plus, she is hot.

90
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,960
Try Akila.

91
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,780
Uh, Akila?

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,860
Okay, I'll try her, too.

93
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,140
Um, but yeah.

94
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,460
Anyway, I hope you guys, uh, I hope you guys enjoy more Mecha Break streams.

95
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:05,800
Yeah!

96
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,620
Uh, blah, blah, blah.

97
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
All right, let's get started.

98
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,480
Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

99
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,440
All right.

100
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,980
Okay, sound guy.

101
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,940
You're gonna have to, like, uh, Discord message me about the sound stuff, too.

102
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,900
All right.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,160
Oh, yeah.

104
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,900
By the way, for those who don't know, by watching, you get Twitch drops.

105
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,640
So don't worry, guys.

106
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,780
I will show you, uh, I'll show you the Twitch drops.

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,760
Let me see.

108
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,260
Sorry, that's Starscream.

109
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:43,440
I, uh, Starscream showed up on the images instead of the, uh, instead of the Twitch drops because I was showing people, um, Windblade's Starscream version earlier to, yesterday.

110
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,140
I was, like, earlier to, wait, no.

111
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,940
I'm, like, losing track of, like, time.

112
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:56,520
So you can be a cat girl, um, by watching this stream today, um, and getting, uh, you know, and getting these Twitch drops.

113
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,520
So you can have, like, you can be a cat girl.

114
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,960
Look, there's the cat tail, too.

115
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,220
The cybermedic tail.

116
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,240
Look at that.

117
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,080
You, too, can become Dolkitty, uh, if you watch my stream right now.

118
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:12,980
Alright.

119
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,520
It's been a while.

120
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,220
Alright.

121
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,340
I'm, I'm, let's see if I remember the controls.

122
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:17,660
Okay.

123
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,080
What's, what's the heavy sniper's name?

124
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
Oh, Akilah.

125
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,480
Okay.

126
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,060
That's her.

127
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,420
Apparently, she's fun to play, too.

128
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,520
So.

129
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,840
So, let's see.

130
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,320
Have I tried her?

131
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,460
I must have tried her, right?

132
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,380
Because I, I didn't have to unlock her.

133
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,880
Unless I, once?

134
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,840
Yeah?

135
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,240
Let's see.

136
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,000
Uh, I'll look at the, I'm gonna look at the practice range.

137
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,120
Let's see.

138
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,860
I feel like I've tried her because I didn't have to unlock her.

139
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,640
Oh, there's matchmaking mode now.

140
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,860
Oh, there's casual and matchmaking now.

141
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,360
For those who, like, don't want to.

142
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,580
Oh, that's cool.

143
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,600
Okay, they, they put it.

144
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,580
Now, you can actually play rank or casual.

145
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,700
Alright, I might.

146
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,420
It'll depend on how much they fuck me up.

147
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,200
Alright, let's see.

148
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,780
I want, I don't remember.

149
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,940
Yeah, there's a casual mode now.

150
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,620
And a rank mode.

151
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,040
Oh, was this the very first mecha I tried?

152
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,900
Yeah, I was gonna say.

153
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,300
I must have tried her before.

154
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Oh, it's the shield girl, right?

155
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,260
I don't remember her stuff, though.

156
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,080
Alright, uh...

157
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,700
Let's see.

158
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,860
F...

159
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,480
2.

160
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,360
Okay, F2.

161
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,140
Alright.

162
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,560
Sniper mode.

163
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Close range mode.

164
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,320
Fires.

165
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,240
Plasma beam.

166
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,220
Inflicting direct energy damage.

167
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:43,880
Fires.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,500
No, no.

169
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:44,780
Okay.

170
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,980
Is this actually?

171
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,980
No, I feel like...

172
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,280
There's the hover forever.

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,880
Airborne grants hovering ability.

174
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,900
Enhancing mobility.

175
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,940
Pulse claw releases tracking drones that lock into the target.

176
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,880
Immobilizing and halting energy regen.

177
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,880
Immobilizing, uh...

178
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,840
Uh...

179
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,860
And then three.

180
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,920
Multi-lock radar.

181
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,080
Uh, reticle size boost lock speed and...

182
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,980
Oh, it's the first one from training.

183
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,540
Oh!

184
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,200
I see.

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,720
Um...

186
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,300
Press again to deactivate early and reduce cooldown.

187
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:18,920
Okay.

188
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,060
Uh...

189
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,840
Boost lock speed and reload speed for...

190
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,380
Press to...

191
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,960
Okay, so...

192
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,100
Regular is...

193
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,160
Activate sniper mode.

194
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,620
Increase flyer's plasma beam.

195
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:29,940
Okay.

196
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,020
Okay.

197
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
I see.

198
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:34,840
Alright.

199
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,800
Let's look at...

200
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,780
Let's do training settings real quick.

201
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,640
Uh...

202
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,200
It doesn't really matter who I get.

203
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,460
Alright.

204
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,200
Yeah, someone...

205
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,800
Okay.

206
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,560
And then...

207
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
I can hover like this.

208
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,620
Okay.

209
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,060
And then...

210
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,600
What is...

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800
This is like...

212
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,460
It doesn't do energy regen.

213
00:11:59,660 --> 00:11:59,880
Okay.

214
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,800
Alright.

215
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,100
She seems pretty easy.

216
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,100
Okay.

217
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,820
Let's try her out in rank.

218
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,500
Uh...

219
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,080
In rank.

220
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,200
Alright.

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,480
I...

222
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,700
I...

223
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,880
Like, her kit is like super easy...

224
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,640
To like...

225
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,780
Figure out in general.

226
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,500
So...

227
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,020
There's not like too much...

228
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,180
Too much to think about.

229
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,120
Which is good.

230
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,620
Because like...

231
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
There's nothing in my head right now.

232
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,460
Oh, good news.

233
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,940
The brain fog is...

234
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,300
Um...

235
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,760
Decreasing.

236
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:22,940
Right?

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,560
It's crazy.

238
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,540
It's like...

239
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,860
You know...

240
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,300
I'm not stressed out anymore.

241
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,060
And it's like...

242
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,000
The brain fog is...

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,920
It's actually...

244
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,580
Uh...

245
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,400
Fading away.

246
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,340
So...

247
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,960
Is that fucking crazy?

248
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,920
I'm not like stressed out over like a birthday...

249
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,020
Dreams and concerts and outfit reveals.

250
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,560
All on like two days.

251
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,820
And now the brain fog is sort of...

252
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,160
Getting...

253
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,840
Like fading away.

254
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,360
Yippee!

255
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,620
Oh my god.

256
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,640
I just slept in too.

257
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,820
I've...

258
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,880
For some reason...

259
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,740
Dad has...

260
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,380
Has only woken me up...

261
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,860
For food.

262
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,600
And that's it.

263
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,140
And then so like...

264
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,680
He let me sleep in.

265
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,860
Um...

266
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,960
He basically has been letting me sleep in...

267
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,920
The last two days.

268
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,720
And I'm like...

269
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,900
I don't know what's happening.

270
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,640
I...

271
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,020
Like...

272
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,320
Like...

273
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,680
I wish he would do that...

274
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,220
When I was going through that...

275
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,580
You know...

276
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,760
The concert planning.

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,940
I wish he would...

278
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,280
You know...

279
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,420
Not be...

280
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,780
Waking me up...

281
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,900
Every hour...

282
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,800
When that was happening.

283
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,860
But for some fucking reason...

284
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,100
After my birthday...

285
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,460
He's like...

286
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:19,960
You know what?

287
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,040
You deserve it.

288
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,660
You...

289
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,200
You know what?

290
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,920
You fucking deserve it.

291
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,080
Jokey.

292
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,500
I'm like...

293
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:31,960
That's cool.

294
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,860
Maybe you should have...

295
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,460
Let me sleep.

296
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,760
Before then...

297
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,280
Before I was like...

298
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,500
You know...

299
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,660
When I needed to sleep...

300
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,760
To do all this work stuff.

301
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,540
Uh...

302
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,140
Oh, it was so kind of him.

303
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,480
You know...

304
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,560
So very kind.

305
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,520
Alright.

306
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,660
Let's try this out.

307
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,780
We'll do matchmaking.

308
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,680
Because like...

309
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,720
Our ELO is low.

310
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,960
Right?

311
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,600
I assume our ELO is low.

312
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,720
Hmm.

313
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,270
Alright.

314
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,350
Very cool, Dad.

315
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,290
Very cool.

316
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,810
I gotta keep track of the time too.

317
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,090
To make sure...

318
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,470
Uh...

319
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,870
We don't go...

320
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,370
Uh...

321
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,110
We don't forget about the custom lobbies.

322
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:14,870
Alright.

323
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,330
Hound Master.

324
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,050
Oh, there's me!

325
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,880
Aquila!

326
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,620
That's me!

327
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,280
Narukami!

328
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,060
Oh my god!

329
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,620
Serpentine!

330
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,260
Thank you for 10 gifted subs!

331
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:32,720
Thank you!

332
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,620
Thank you!

333
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,760
I really appreciate it.

334
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Thank you so much!

335
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,520
How many snipers do we have?

336
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,080
Okay, no.

337
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,740
You don't...

338
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,800
I feel like this game doesn't need support.

339
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
Like, it's literally just fragging.

340
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,300
Maybe it's because it's a low ELO.

341
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Like...

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,380
But I feel like I've only seen one support since...

343
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,240
The last...

344
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,700
The two times I've been playing this game.

345
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,680
Like...

346
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,100
I don't know.

347
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,000
I feel like I have not seen a support at all.

348
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,300
Depending on the game mode...

349
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,420
Oh, you definitely need support.

350
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,680
Which game mode requires support the most?

351
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,760
Pilot proceeding on board.

352
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,300
Actually, very good.

353
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,560
Oh, when it's 3v3.

354
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh, supports are not easy to play.

355
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,920
Oh, don't tell necros that.

356
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,240
I don't know.

357
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,080
I just haven't seen a support player in many of my lobbies.

358
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,620
But to be fair, like...

359
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,380
They're a rare breed.

360
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Alright, tell me which is the best...

361
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,320
Which is the meta support?

362
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,660
I'll try that one out.

363
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,960
I haven't tried support yet.

364
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,780
And also tank, but I'm never touching tank.

365
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,680
Because, like, what the fuck?

366
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,160
Like...

367
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,920
I feel like...

368
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,400
I don't know.

369
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,240
I feel like...

370
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,840
Tank is like...

371
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,620
That's M territory right there.

372
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,400
Alright.

373
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Oh my god.

374
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,460
It's been a while since I played.

375
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,120
So I'm, like, trying to remember the controls.

376
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,120
Where are they?

377
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,940
Hello, guys.

378
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,260
Hey.

379
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,670
Where's no day?

380
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,190
Oh my god.

381
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,670
There's Sar...

382
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,850
There he is.

383
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh my god.

384
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,720
It's so...

385
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,100
Wait, what?

386
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,410
Sorry.

387
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,390
I had to, like, stop myself.

388
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,350
Because I'm, like, I'm sponsored.

389
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,810
You guys can sort of tell I had to stop myself.

390
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,490
I couldn't help it.

391
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,270
There you go.

392
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,910
Close call, guys.

393
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,610
Oh shit.

394
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,030
Oh my god.

395
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,370
Bro.

396
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,810
Okay.

397
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,690
I'm gaming.

398
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,430
Are you stupid?

399
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,650
Bro, are you stupid?

400
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,690
Are you...

401
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,570
Bro.

402
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,550
What are you trying to do?

403
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,550
Oh shit.

404
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,330
I'm stupid.

405
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,310
Okay.

406
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,650
Oh no.

407
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,410
I'm stupid.

408
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,610
Come on.

409
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,990
No!

410
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,310
You're so lucky!

411
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,710
You are so lucky!

412
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,990
You're so lucky!

413
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,690
You're so lucky!

414
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:29,950
You're so lucky!

415
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,730
You're so lucky!

416
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,590
Oh my god.

417
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,670
I was ready!

418
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,490
Oh my...

419
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,790
You do not deserve to live.

420
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,270
You really...

421
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,690
I died by gravity.

422
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:40,890
Truly.

423
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,170
Actually.

424
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,410
A gravity debuff right there.

425
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,590
Where is the objective?

426
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,870
I am not paying attention to that.

427
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,570
You're looking to pick off some stragglers.

428
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:55,710
Yeah.

429
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,050
You're my own nemesis.

430
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,990
Like gravity.

431
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,270
Don't worry.

432
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,270
I'm heading over to help.

433
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,430
Don't worry.

434
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,220
Okay.

435
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,940
Where is it?

436
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,600
Okay.

437
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,620
Oh my god.

438
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,240
I got that platform!

439
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,480
Nice.

440
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
I'm gonna...

441
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,420
Make sure I charge it.

442
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,140
There you go.

443
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,460
God, I'm gaming.

444
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm playing for the kills.

445
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,660
Not the...

446
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,960
Not the objective.

447
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,620
Guys, I would say that if I wasn't in rank right now.

448
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,360
Okay?

449
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,660
If I wasn't in rank, I would...

450
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,360
True.

451
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,860
But I'm in rank right now.

452
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
So I can't do that.

453
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,490
Oh my god.

454
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:03,910
Of course.

455
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,610
He dropped.

456
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,470
He dodged it.

457
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,070
Come on.

458
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,670
Get over here.

459
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,130
That's fucking right.

460
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,070
Get over here.

461
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,670
Oh my god.

462
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,070
You're such a little bitch.

463
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,570
Wait, who's that?

464
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,390
Oh, that's a...

465
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,990
That's my team.

466
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,570
Just go for a kill.

467
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,330
Okay.

468
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,250
Oh my god.

469
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,610
Okay.

470
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,470
I don't...

471
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:27,970
Hello.

472
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,050
Teammate?

473
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,730
Bro, what the...

474
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,170
Okay.

475
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,990
That was sick.

476
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,230
Okay.

477
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,690
You gotta admit.

478
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,350
That was sick.

479
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,270
I was like, he must be in that corner.

480
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,790
I...

481
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,810
I knew it.

482
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,810
I was like, okay.

483
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,270
He's definitely in that corner.

484
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,310
Like...

485
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,710
He asked me.

486
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,850
Like, where else would you go?

487
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,610
You about to learn today, son.

488
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,530
Oh my god.

489
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,010
Water?

490
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,390
But I'm a robot.

491
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,930
Okay.

492
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,790
Alright.

493
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,810
Where's the mecha here?

494
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,210
That's right.

495
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,950
I'm here for you.

496
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,690
Where is he?

497
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,030
Oh, there he is.

498
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,370
Oh, you think I...

499
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,330
Oh, that's fucking right.

500
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,890
Oh, oh, that's right.

501
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,050
Whoa.

502
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,710
That's right.

503
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,390
Dodge.

504
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,290
Get dodged.

505
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,570
Get shit on.

506
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,290
They're like, why is she in this elo?

507
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,310
I bet you they're like, bro, what the heck?

508
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,550
Why is this dogey bird in this elo?

509
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,370
They don't know.

510
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,730
I was busy with my birthday, so I couldn't play the game.

511
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,270
Got that water.

512
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,410
Okay.

513
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,370
Alright.

514
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,450
Okay.

515
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,630
Oh, there's so many people here.

516
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,250
I want...

517
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,230
I want to kill this guy.

518
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,650
There we go.

519
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,910
That's goddamn right.

520
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,290
That's goddamn right.

521
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,910
Get over here.

522
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,470
You're so lucky I have to reload.

523
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,890
What do you mean by low elo?

524
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,430
I'm not supposed to be in this elo.

525
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,730
That's what I mean.

526
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,670
Like, you can tell.

527
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,830
You can tell by how these players are playing.

528
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,490
No!

529
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,350
Guys, what happened to...

530
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,110
Guys, oh my god.

531
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,170
I am actually doing so much for this team.

532
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,570
What are you saying?

533
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,430
I don't know.

534
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,880
Oh my god.

535
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,220
Get out of here.

536
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,740
I'm doing so much.

537
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,740
I'm actually doing so much for this team.

538
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,140
There's no way.

539
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,220
There's no way we're losing this.

540
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,100
I am...

541
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,420
I've been killing people all day.

542
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,790
Oh my god.

543
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,890
You better not die.

544
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,610
That's right.

545
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,650
Oh my god.

546
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,910
You're fucking welcome.

547
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,830
You little guy.

548
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,650
You goddamn welcome.

549
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,750
I guess I'll cap another objective.

550
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,570
Not enough kills.

551
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,550
Like, I'm just saying.

552
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,170
Like, are you serious?

553
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,730
Oh my guys.

554
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,450
I see you.

555
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,290
You're so lucky.

556
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,630
You're so...

557
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:29,970
Oh my god.

558
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,270
Nice.

559
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,550
Oh, I got you.

560
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,230
Oh my god.

561
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,030
I don't got you.

562
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,890
That's fine.

563
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,950
Oh, that's not fine.

564
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,670
Oh my god.

565
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,590
It's the tank, man.

566
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,010
The tank, man.

567
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,430
Oh my god.

568
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,810
Not the tank, man.

569
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,810
Tank, man.

570
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,310
And...

571
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,090
Skabada-doo.

572
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,950
Okay.

573
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,530
I need help against this guy, though.

574
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,630
Oh my god.

575
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:58,970
Wait.

576
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,820
Be close range.

577
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,600
Oh my god.

578
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,500
I can't get in there.

579
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,900
That's the worst part.

580
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
Oh my god.

581
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,360
I can't go in.

582
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,340
Someone has...

583
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,590
Seriously?

584
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:18,810
No.

585
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,050
Where's your locket?

586
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,650
Okay.

587
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,910
That's like one thing I keep forgetting to use.

588
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,590
I keep forgetting to use the locket because there's never been a point to...

589
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,510
That's my sniper rushing to the point.

590
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,130
I swear to god.

591
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,670
Their panther was on the hunt.

592
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,350
My kid...

593
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,630
No.

594
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,760
I used much.

595
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,320
Are you...

596
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,140
Bro, my kill.

597
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,200
What do they want from me?

598
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,280
What does my team want?

599
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,820
I have nine kills.

600
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,460
You've done zero objective.

601
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,880
That's on you, girl.

602
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,520
I'm a fragger.

603
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,080
What do you mean?

604
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,100
I frag.

605
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,020
I'm a fragger.

606
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,030
Okay.

607
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,570
Okay.

608
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,700
All right.

609
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,480
Fuck this guy.

610
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,820
I'm sad.

611
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,700
I'm so sad.

612
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,500
I'm...

613
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,280
I'm so sad.

614
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,000
What more can I do?

615
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,760
What more can I...

616
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,640
I literally killed everyone.

617
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,460
What more can I do for my team?

618
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,480
What...

619
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
That is sad.

620
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,800
I was...

621
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,440
Fragging.

622
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Like hopping between...

623
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,940
People were there capping.

624
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,840
I made sure...

625
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,180
That my team was capping...

626
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,220
Before I left.

627
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,520
Killstall.

628
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,180
One of the games.

629
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,120
Doki.

630
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,500
You know what more you could do?

631
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,140
And I'm not...

632
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,960
Okay.

633
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,680
Okay.

634
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,580
Oh, wait.

635
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,780
I have to be SVP, right?

636
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,640
Okay.

637
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,200
There we go.

638
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,480
Oh.

639
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm not even SVP.

640
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,280
Oh.

641
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,760
Just because I don't cap the point...

642
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
I don't deserve to be MVP.

643
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
Bro, I don't even get...

644
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,320
MVP goes to the objective.

645
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,920
That is so...

646
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,200
Oh.

647
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,060
Just because I don't capture the point...

648
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,900
I just don't deserve to be MVP.

649
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,060
That is...

650
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,640
Me?

651
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,040
What?

652
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,840
I am literally...

653
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,800
The sniper.

654
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,200
What am I...

655
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,280
What do you do?

656
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,240
Why would I be on the point?

657
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,460
If I'm...

658
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,680
The sniper.

659
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,420
Literally.

660
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,640
What more can I do for you?

661
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,140
If only you had this point.

662
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,840
Bro.

663
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,580
Wait.

664
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,040
Okay.

665
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,760
Top assault.

666
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,420
Okay.

667
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,820
Let's see how much damage I've done.

668
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,980
I swear to God.

669
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,340
Okay.

670
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,040
Okay.

671
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,620
What's my damage?

672
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,400
What is...

673
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,440
I need a...

674
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,560
No.

675
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,700
I need a...

676
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,080
Oh.

677
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,020
Oh my...

678
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,300
Wait.

679
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,000
What the...

680
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,300
Okay.

681
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,020
Okay.

682
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,480
Damage taken.

683
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,980
Okay, buddies.

684
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,220
Okay.

685
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,120
Bro.

686
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,140
This guy.

687
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,300
Lord B has done 49,000 damage.

688
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,900
What was your goal here?

689
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,760
I...

690
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,240
I've done...

691
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,690
One, two, three, four.

692
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,790
If you combine four of their players, they still don't equal my damage.

693
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:54,870
They...

694
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,250
They still...

695
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,930
We got robbed!

696
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,500
We got...

697
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,740
We got...

698
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,840
He...

699
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,660
He capped...

700
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:05,980
But...

701
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,400
But...

702
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,800
But Donkey though...

703
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,680
Look, he captured two points.

704
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,360
Look at your captures.

705
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:11,960
Zero.

706
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,660
I was robbed!

707
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,400
But did you do the objective, though?

708
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,380
That's it.

709
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,960
That's it.

710
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,340
I'm going to 3v3.

711
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm at it.

712
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,940
If you had someone trying to cap in, this also counts as playing objective.

713
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,120
If I see... I could have all this.

714
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,620
Alright.

715
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,900
Yo, thank you for the hundred bitties!

716
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,120
Thank you, thank you!

717
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
Ready to strike.

718
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,420
That's it.

719
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,060
Ready to strike.

720
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,660
Get ready.

721
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm here to snipe again.

722
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,260
I'm going to deathmatch.

723
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,440
There's no objectives in deathmatch.

724
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,160
It's all about killing.

725
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,140
Alright.

726
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,800
Alright, let's see.

727
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,620
I'm bringing up the volume a little more.

728
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,200
Alright, I brought up the volume a little more, sound guy.

729
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,400
Damn those snuck crates.

730
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,860
You're still wearing goddamn objectives now to stop me!

731
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,770
Alright, here I go.

732
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,150
Here I fucking go!

733
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,250
I can't believe it.

734
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,210
I used- I was so happy in the beginning.

735
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,930
I was like, look at me, guys.

736
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,210
Look at me fragging.

737
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,970
Oh, wow!

738
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,010
No, not this map!

739
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,690
Not this map!

740
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,250
No!

741
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,690
Not this map!

742
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,430
Oh, my god!

743
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,420
Oh, my god!

744
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:13,600
Oh, my gosh.

745
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,260
I'd think, a little bit.

746
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,190
Can I immobilize him?

747
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,450
No, I didn't want to shoot you.

748
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,550
Okay.

749
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,230
Okay.

750
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,070
That's fine.

751
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,090
No.

752
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,710
Oh my god.

753
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,310
That was close.

754
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,250
That was not fine.

755
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,170
Oh my god.

756
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:38,890
Please!

757
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,070
Shoot him!

758
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,550
Oh my god.

759
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,230
Stop flying!

760
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,150
I can't shoot!

761
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,640
There we go.

762
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,980
Oh my god.

763
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,980
It took so long.

764
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,400
I was reloading.

765
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,680
My energy was so low.

766
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,660
He's so lucky.

767
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,460
He's so lucky.

768
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
There's a Nurukami.

769
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,540
I see you.

770
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,640
I see you.

771
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,940
I see you.

772
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,740
I know you're here.

773
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,650
Oh god, I'm so- OH SHIT!

774
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:22,950
SHIT!

775
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,510
Oh my god.

776
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,010
I have to like- OH MY GOD.

777
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,810
I'm still flying.

778
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,050
I'm like this.

779
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,970
I hate this map.

780
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,950
I hate this map.

781
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,140
Okay.

782
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,200
Up this.

783
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:43,930
That's fine.

784
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,770
Haha!

785
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,810
Stay outta here!

786
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,010
Alright.

787
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,730
We're fine.

788
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,430
This map makes me panic so much though.

789
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,710
Like, not gonna lie.

790
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,870
I panic so much.

791
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,570
for this map.

792
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,190
Cause it's so scary.

793
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,290
What?

794
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,670
Oh my god.

795
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,090
Oh!

796
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:13,570
Is that him?

797
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,150
I don't know.

798
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,030
I can't tell.

799
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:18,930
Okay.

800
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,250
Nice.

801
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,070
I'm gonna help my team.

802
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,610
That's right!

803
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,210
Locked in!

804
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:25,890
Aimbot!

805
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,370
That's right!

806
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,630
There's no objective now!

807
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,810
Hahaha!

808
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,410
I'm unstoppable when there's no objective!

809
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,050
No objectives!

810
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,590
Oh my god.

811
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,970
I'm always like, so paranoid.

812
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,130
Hahaha!

813
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,790
That's right!

814
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,280
Here we go.

815
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,680
Get outta here!

816
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,320
Get outta here!

817
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,760
Get outta here!

818
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
Get your ass outta here!

819
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,320
Get out!

820
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,440
Hahaha!

821
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,080
Wait, you're still alive?

822
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,160
You're still alive?

823
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,340
You're still alive?

824
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,340
What?

825
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,140
What is that?

826
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
What the fuck is that?

827
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,240
Was that- Is that here?

828
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,380
Like, what is that?

829
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,700
Hahaha!

830
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,300
I just don't know what that was!

831
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,880
Oh my god, bro!

832
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,560
That poor guy!

833
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,580
Hahaha!

834
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,400
Oh shit!

835
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:31,920
Poor ass!

836
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,680
Oh!

837
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,680
Hahaha!

838
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,100
I don't think he knows.

839
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,400
I don't think he knows I'm there.

840
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,740
Hahaha!

841
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,620
Hahaha!

842
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,640
He's just- That's right!

843
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,340
He's just- That's right!

844
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,200
No objectives gonna stop me now!

845
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,100
That's right!

846
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,820
Also, Arrow, thank you for the hundred videos!

847
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,420
Thank you!

848
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,220
Thank you!

849
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,560
That's goddamn right!

850
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,920
Ooh!

851
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,140
8-0!

852
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,900
Easy!

853
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,680
I ain't- Okay, I- Yeah, I- I- I didn't get MVP there.

854
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,980
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

855
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,600
That's fine.

856
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,600
That's fine.

857
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,040
You know?

858
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,660
That's okay.

859
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,380
That's okay.

860
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:11,740
That's okay.

861
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,060
That's okay.

862
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,780
I did my job.

863
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,140
You know?

864
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,380
Oh, just cuz he did more- One kill more than me.

865
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,160
That's- That's fine.

866
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,400
That's- That's fine.

867
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,420
Just cuz- Oh, wait, no.

868
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,460
Just cuz- Wow!

869
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,580
I did so much!

870
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,300
Damage!

871
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,840
Hahaha!

872
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,300
Are you kidding me?

873
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,320
Are you- I- I just- Oh!

874
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,680
Yeah, it was not fine.

875
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,340
It- It was- It was- Not enough.

876
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:40,980
Okay.

877
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,800
I don't understand!

878
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,560
I don't understand!

879
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,200
I got more- Look- Oh, I got- Someone had to whittle those guys down!

880
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,900
Bro, stole your kills and the MVP!

881
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,920
We got robbed!

882
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,240
Hahaha!

883
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,880
That's it.

884
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,560
One less kill.

885
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,320
I can't believe it.

886
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,700
Can't- That's it!

887
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm pulling out the- Big boys now!

888
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,980
That's it!

889
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,480
Get outta here!

890
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,160
I'm pulling- I'm pulling out the hot one!

891
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,740
Hahaha!

892
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,680
Hahaha!

893
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,140
Hahaha!

894
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,500
Hahaha!

895
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Hahaha!

896
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:25,980
Hahaha!

897
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,000
Hahaha!

898
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,560
I'm giving out the really hot one!

899
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,160
That's- God damn it!

900
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,660
Oh my god!

901
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,480
Wait.

902
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,360
Wait.

903
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,220
I think they- They balanced me.

904
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,980
Oh no.

905
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:38,900
Wait a minute.

906
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,920
Hahaha!

907
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,480
Wait!

908
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:52,860
Did I- They- They- Did you see that?

909
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,720
They- They- Did you see that?

910
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,560
500 plus kills?

911
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,940
Wait a minute.

912
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,240
That does- I- I'm in the AP course now.

913
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,160
Oh!

914
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Oh wait.

915
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,500
I think I got auto-balanced.

916
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,300
Hahaha!

917
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Hahaha!

918
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Hahaha!

919
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,600
Oh that's awkward!

920
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,420
Oh wait.

921
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,200
Oh wait.

922
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,900
Wait a minute.

923
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,360
Why this- Guys!

924
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,400
Why do they have 500 plus kills?

925
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,320
Why?

926
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:36,960
Why- I need a note.

927
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,580
I need a note guys.

928
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,740
Will we be fine?

929
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,600
It's time to find out.

930
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:43,960
Wait.

931
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,580
I think-

932
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,180
Okay.

933
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,960
Oh shit!

934
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,780
Oh shit!

935
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Oh shit!

936
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,820
Guys, I don't think we're gonna be fine.

937
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,260
Oh my god.

938
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,180
Guys.

939
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,460
I- I'm a little worried now.

940
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,020
For real.

941
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,940
Hahaha!

942
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,660
Hahaha!

943
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:09,880
Hahaha!

944
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:09,960
Hahaha!

945
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,260
Hahaha!

946
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,800
Okay.

We got one.

949
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,380
I got scared cuz he got close to me.

950
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,120
And we all know what happens when they get too close.

951
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,300
Guys, we all know what happens when they get way too close, guys.

952
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,300
Oh my god.

953
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,980
Wait, what?

954
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,180
Oh, I keep forgetting like- I have like separate ammo.

955
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,240
Okay, nice.

956
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,760
It's fine.

957
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,840
We're fine.

958
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,780
We're so healthy.

959
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,660
We're so healthy.

960
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,040
Where are they?

961
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,700
Wait, how did we already get four kills?

962
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,500
That's crazy.

963
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,740
That's actually crazy that we have four kills already.

964
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,860
Hahaha!

965
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Hahaha!

966
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,100
Bro, I've been matchmaking!

967
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,180
That's the craziest part.

968
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,720

969
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:01,600

Okay!

971
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,040
Okay!

972
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,200
This might not be fair.

973
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,200
Hahaha!

974
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Hahaha!

975
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,340
This might not be fair.

976
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,840
This might not be fair at all.

977
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,680
In general.

978
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,400
Hahaha!

979
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,540
Hahaha!

980
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:21,780
Hahaha!

981
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,960
I don't think this is fair.

982
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,780
Hahaha!

983
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,260
Hahaha!

984
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,700
Holy shit!

985
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,120
Okay, I'm a little scared now though.

986
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,520
Uh, we're already at one kill.

987
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
We're- Hahaha!

988
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,000

00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,340
Oh shit!

993
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,220
Oh shit!

994
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:45,760
Nevermind!

995
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,700
Nevermind!

996
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,040
Nevermind!

997
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,400
Nevermind!

998
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,820
Don't worry!

999
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,460
Beat him up again!

1000
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,260
Beat him up again!

1001
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:49,920
Beat him up again!

1002
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,720
Get him in the corner!

1003
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,480
Hahaha!

1004
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,480
So fast!

1005
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,540
What happened?

1006
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,200
What happened?

1007
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,420
What happened to this- That was- G- G?

1008
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,780
Like- What happened?

1009
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,160
What-

1010
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:22,180
What did he- Bro, like- Why did this game?

1011
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,840
I'm so confused.

1012
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,560
I didn't- Hahaha!

1013
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Hahaha!

1014
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,820
Everybody was so fast.

1015
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,000
We have to say, what is he doing here?

1016
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,660
I thought this was rake.

1017
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,320
Zero, zero, zero.

1018
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,020
Yeah, that was like actually the fastest game of mecha break I've ever played.

1019
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,300
2, middle instant equals instant 10.

1020
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,540
Hey, hey, hey, look.

1021
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,060
I did my job.

1022
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:57,500
Look at...

1023
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,620
How did I do the... How did I take the most damage?

1024
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,320
These two are melee characters.

1025
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,120
How... Why were they... Why were they taking less damage than me?

1026
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,940
I don't understand.

1027
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,420
Were they not shooting back?

1028
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,860
Bro, were they... They didn't... They didn't shoot them.

1029
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,140
They didn't... I face tech more than our melee characters.

1030
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,940
That's crazy.

1031
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,860
Bro, it sucks to be these guys.

1032
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,940
These guys were not having a good time for sure.

1033
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,440
You caught... They cowered in fear.

1034
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,620
I don't know how the fuck you was in my lobby.

1035
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,400
That's crazy.

1036
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,840
All right.

1037
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,420
All right.

1038
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,720
I'll try a new character.

1039
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,840
Okay, guys.

1040
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,860
Who's meta in support, guys?

1041
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,620
Which support character is meta?

1042
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,720
Your bonds?

1043
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,880
Yeah, and then we have a GM.

1044
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,440
Okay.

1045
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,340
What was her name?

1046
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,460
Panaka?

1047
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,120
This one?

1048
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,760
All right.

1049
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,160
Who is she?

1050
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,760
Oh, it's this one!

1051
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,400
All right.

1052
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,200
I heard that.

1053
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,240
Okay, she's meta.

1054
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,500
Apparently, she's really good.

1055
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,260
All right.

1056
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,060
We'll try her out.

1057
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,020
Go.

1058
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,240
Yeah, she has... I like her design.

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,800
I like the wheel at the back.

Thank you.

Thank you.

1063
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,520
Do the dragoons have a tactical unit?

1064
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:31,840
Oh, wait.

1065
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,360
What's that?

1066
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,980
How do I play here?

1067
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,100
All right.

1068
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,720

00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,660

00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,380
In front of the support.

1080
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,360
It fires when emergency support drone is deployed.

1081
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,180
It fires in front of the support target instead.

1082

Direct hits bypass things and force fields dealing high physical damage.

1100
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,140

1101
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,920

1121
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,870

So that heals.

1124

1131
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,090

This is heal?

1134
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,100
This isn't heal, right?

1135
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,420
And then...

1136
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,080
I can drop a wall.

1137
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,760
Okay.

1138
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,100
The wall!

1139
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,460
Okay.

1140
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,060
That's silly.

1141
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:25,960
That's funny.

1142
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,000
I like that.

1143
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,860
That's pretty funny.

1144
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,520
Okay, wait.

1145
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,100
Uh...

1146
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,640
I wanna drop a wall on someone.

1147
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,780
Get over here.

1148
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,680
Oh my god.

1149
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,180
I missed.

1150
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:37,880
Oh my god.

1151
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,020
Wait.

1152
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,760
How many walls can I make?

1153
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,360
Oh my god.

1154
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,140
Please drop the wall on her!

1155
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,140
Guys!

1156
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,800
I need it to be on her!

1157
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,220
Okay, there we go.

1158
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,000
There we go.

1159
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,840
There we go.

1160
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,600
I think I can do like three.

1161
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:55,960
Okay.

1162
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,820
And then that's like the force field too.

1163
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:58,900
Okay.

1164
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,060
Oh, I have to hold it.

1165
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,740
Oh!

1166
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:04,860
Okay.

1167
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,040
The wall!

1168
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh my god.

1169
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,480
I barely do damage though.

1170
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,160
I think.

1171
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,000
I don't do a lot of...

1172
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,240
Wait.

1173
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:19,940
No, I do actually.

1174
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:20,400
Nevermind.

1175
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,760
It's because of the armor.

1176
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,060
Alright.

1177
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,720
I think I could.

1178
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,040
Wait, that's good damage.

1179
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:25,360
Yeah.

1180
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,300
Yeah.

1181
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:26,820
It's time.

1182
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,500
It's time to make some walls.

1183
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,360
Alright.

1184
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:29,960
Nevermind.

1185
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,880
I have to like make sure the armor is out.

1186
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,840
You're a healer, don't you?

1187
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,860
What did you expect?

1188
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:37,660
Um.

1189
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,720
How else am I gonna defend myself?

1190
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,240
Um.

1191
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,860
I may be a healer.

1192
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,860
But like.

1193
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,020
I need to defend myself.

1194
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,280
My damage should be like ten times stronger.

1195
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,360
than the DPS.

1196
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:51,780
Um.

1197
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,520
The DPS.

1198
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:54,820
The DPS.

1199
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:54,920
Yeah.

1200
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,540
Healers need MVP too.

1201
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,300
You know that, right?

1202
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,040
The best support, is the support that can defend herself.

1203
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,460
Alright.

1204
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,080
No, you don't.

1205
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,840
Yeah, it says.

1206
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,740
Typical DPS player.

1207
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,280
Doesn't want the healer to be able to self defend.

1208
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,280
Oh, you want the support to be like.

1209
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,100
Oh, DPS please.

1210
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,620
Save me.

1211
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,040
I am a strong independent support player.

1212
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,300
I need no DPS to defend me.

1213
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,460
Knock in boys.

1214
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,700
I'm Nanak.TerLaugh.

1215
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,000
I am naa.

1216
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,000
List.

1217
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,840
Save me, DPS!

1218
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:59,120
I am a strong leader atлом.

1219
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,450
Alright, here we go.

1220
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,570
Time to play the quote-on-quote objective.

1221
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,310
Okay, you can't yell at me for not playing objective when my mission is to just heal.

1222
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,590
You can't... You can't blame me.

1223
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,790
This is now all dependent on my team now.

1224
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,290
Oh my god, I start in the water?

1225
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,190
Oh wait, no, we're going out.

1226
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,210
Oh, that's cool, actually.

1227
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,930
Oh, it's car.

1228
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,150
Oh, it's escort.

1229
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,510
Oh, that's cool.

1230
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,610
No, I got you.

1231
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,410
I got you.

1232
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,470
Oh, wait!

1233
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:46,950
Who's got me?

1234
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,010
Hello, support me!

1235
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:55,940
Okay.

1236
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,300
I'm going to support their detail.

1237
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,960
Support player needs help, please.

1238
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,120
Oh!

1239
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,300
Did I help?

1240
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,950
Oh, please!

1241
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,300
Support player needs help!

1242
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,000
Support!

1243
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,120
Please!

1244
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,960
Am I helping?

1245
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,060
Am I helping?

1246
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:34,810
Oh!

1247
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,690
No, wait, no, give it to me!

1248
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:39,830
Give it to me!

1249
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,830
I don't want to be support anymore!

1250
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,650
I don't want to be support!

1251
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,310
I don't like it.

1252
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,390
I don't like it.

1253
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,290
Guys, I don't think...

1254
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:16,370
I am the thing I'm meant to be a support in Mecha Freak.

1255
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,140
I am...

1256
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,750
You're fine.

1257
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,390
I don't know, I can't tell!

1258
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,390
I can't tell at all!

1259
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,350
I don't know

1260
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,480
what...

1261
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,220
Wall!

1262
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,280
I don't know how I'm alive!

1263
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,880
I don't know.

1264
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,880
I don't know...

1265
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,820
I don't know.

1266
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:50,780
Shit!

1267
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,060
Oh, my god.

1268
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,640
Oh, my god.

1269
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,300
Where are they?

1270
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,460
Where are they?

1271
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,080
Oh, my god.

1272
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,700
I should help them.

1273
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,080
Don't worry.

1274
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,660
I got you!

1275
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,800
Double kill!

1276
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,160
I don't know what I did, but double kill!

1277
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,000
Don't worry.

1278
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:09,720
I got you!

1279
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,080
I got you!

1280
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:12,620
I got you, girl!

1281
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,320
One!

1282
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,680
One!

1283
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,700
Another one!

1284
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,220
Look at all these wands!

1285
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:26,690
Please!

1286
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,450
He's coming for me, isn't he?

1287
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,090
Okay.

1288
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,650
Okay, it's fine.

1289
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:34,970
It's fine.

1290
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,470
I got you.

1291
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,770
There we go.

1292
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,430
Oh my god.

1293
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,810
Who's got me, though?

1294
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:42,930
Who's got me?

1295
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,590
Oh my god!

1296
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,130
Please!

1297
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,710
Someone come over here!

1298
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:54,970
Oh, I got you!

1299
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,150
There we go.

1300
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,250
Oh my god, I leave!

1301
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:02,530
Woo!

1302
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,290
Wait, where's our cart?

1303
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,470
Oh shit, it's over!

1304
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,090
I forgot where our cart went!

1305
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,950
I was like, where is it?

1306
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:13,670
Don't worry!

1307
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:14,410
There are walls!

1308
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,690
All the walls!

1309
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,010
All of it!

1310
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,710
Look at all these walls, guys!

1311
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,230
Okay, nice.

1312
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,030
Don't keep these.

1313
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,370
Oh my god!

1314
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,870
It's just all walls!

1315
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:32,910
It's just all walls!

1316
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,550
All walls!

1317
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,270
Bro, I can't tell what's going on anymore.

1318
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,230
How did I get up here.

1319
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:47,110
How did I... JK, it's all walls.

1320
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,410
More walls!

1321
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,310
There's so many walls!

1322
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,830
There's so many walls!

1323
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,290
Where am I?

1324
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,890
It's just all walls!

1325
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,730
That's right!

1326
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,350
It's just walls.

1327
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,450
There we go.

1328
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,670
There we go.

1329
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:11,750
Nice.

1330
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,610
Nice.

1331
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:16,070
Watch this!

1332
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:16,990
What?

1333
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,570
Oh wait, he's so far.

1334
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,690
Did we win?

1335
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,430
Did we- Did we- Get up here!

1336
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:24,710
Okay.

1337
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,290
Oh, I got you.

1338
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,370
I got you!

1339
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,490
You are at walls!

1340
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,990
I was- I was struck before the token.

1341
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,570
Wait, wait.

1342
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,450
Were we doing bad?

1343
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,210
Guys!

1344
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,550
The thing is!

1345
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,570
I can't even tell if we are doing bad.

1346
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,230
Like, I don't know what's going on.

1347
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,910
Don't worry, I've got you.

1348
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:52,890
I'm healing.

1349
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,010
I'm doing my job.

1350
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,230
I'm doing my job.

1351
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,010
Oh my god.

1352
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,390
Where's the objective?

1353
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,590
Guys, I actually don't know where the objectives are.

1354
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,850
I can't tell.

1355
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,720
Am I...

1356
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,830
Are we doing it?

1357
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,610
Guys, are we doing it?

1358
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,670
I can't tell.

1359
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:29,750
Okay.

1360
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,610
I think I am doing it.

1361
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:32,730
I think I am.

1362
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,810
Don't worry, I'll put down a wall just in case.

1363
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,150
I'll put it down.

1364
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,270
I think it's helping.

1365
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:41,430
Assist.

1366
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:43,590
My new team.

1367
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:43,910
Yay!

1368
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:44,670
We're winning!

1369
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,050
I can't tell!

1370
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,210
But yay!

1371
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,950
We're doing it!

1372
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:53,930
Okay, nice.

1373
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:56,190
Nice.

1374
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,830
I-I legitimately can't tell, so I'm glad.

1375
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm glad.

1376
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,570
I'm glad.

1377
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,850
It's hard to tell.

1378
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,230
It really is.

1379
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,630
Build that wall.

1380
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,690
I'll keep building walls!

1381
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,670
Don't worry, everybody.

1382
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,450
I'll keep building those walls!

1383
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,730
We're doing it!

1384
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,530
There's so many walls, but we're doing it.

1385
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,490
Alright.

1386
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,290
Alright.

1387
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:30,710
Alright, nice.

1388
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,250
We're still doing it!

1389
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,370
Jesus Christ, please!

1390
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,590
Please just kill him!

1391
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:41,890
Please!

1392
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:43,430
Please!

1393
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,860
I'm doing it!

1394
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:48,980
Oh!

1395
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,900
Don't let him get me!

1396
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:50,380
Please!

1397
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,260
I'm just the support!

1398
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,120
Wow!

1399
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,140
Okay, we're five.

1400
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,940
Oh, so...

1401
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,620
It's okay.

1402
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,760
I built... I did it.

1403
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,520
I did it.

1404
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,340
Like, where's our car?

1405
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,800
Is that our car?

1406
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,260
Is that it?

1407
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,220
Wait, what?

1408
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,120
Wait, that's the enemy...

1409
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,940
Where's our car?

1410
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,420
Oh my god!

1411
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,540
Our car is over...

1412
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,370
Why were I...

1413
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,310
Why were we fighting there?

1414
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,230
For the longest...

1415
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,590
Okay, I don't understand.

1416
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:39,310
Wait, but why were we fighting there?

1417
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:40,330
What?

1418
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,990
I was just...

1419
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,330
I literally stayed with my team!

1420
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:45,830
Because they...

1421
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,310
Everybody was there!

1422
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,750
I don't understand!

1423
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,730
If that was not...

1424
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,070
I'm so confused!

1425
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,050
Oh, I was preventing the enemy.

1426
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,990
Okay, but if we just pushed our own car, we don't have to worry about that.

1427
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,630
Yo, is that crazy for me to say that?

1428
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:16,550
If we just pushed our own car, we'll never have to worry.

1429
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,470
Yes, it is!

1430
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:24,270
That's so controversial, why would you say that?

1431
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,810
By standing...

1432
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,830
Bro, like, all of us were standing there!

1433
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:35,950
So I was like, wait!

1434
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:36,770
Wait!

1435
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:37,610
What was that?

1436
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,710
That wasn't the car?

1437
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:43,010
Okay.

1438
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:48,210
Oh my god, I have no idea what the plan is for this guy.

1439
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,130
Oh my god, their plan is to try and kill me.

1440
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,090
I get it now.

1441
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,470
I get it.

1442
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,690
Oh my god, they really want me dead.

1443
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,930
They really want me dead.

1444
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,450
Yeah, I'm gonna heal.

1445
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,790
Oh shit!

1446
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,150
Yeah, I need...

1447
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:10,850
Where am I?

1448
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:14,990
Everything's fine.

1449
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:16,990
Alright.

1450
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,370
Am I helping?

1451
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,190
I think I am?

1452
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,290
I...

1453
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,230
I think so.

1454
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,530
We just need more walls.

1455
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,570
There we go.

1456
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:32,950
We did it.

1457
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:34,910
I'm building a wall.

1458
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,590
You can't get in now.

1459
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:39,790
Perhaps...

1460
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,810
I just needed...

1461
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,550
I just needed more walls.

1462
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,650
I'm doing it, guys.

1463
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,830
There we go.

1464
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:53,510
There we go.

1465
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,530
Sombra, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1466
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:56,710
Thank you, thank you.

1467
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,630
I...

1468
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,230
I don't know what was going...

1469
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,310
I don't know what was going on.

1470
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,230
But we did it.

1471
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:05,790
Alright.

1472
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,370
Nice topic.

1473
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,630
26 assists.

1474
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,150
I like tickled everybody.

1475
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,570
Everybody was touched by me.

1476
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:21,170
Omega, thank you for the five gifted subs.

1477
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,510
Thank you, thank you.

1478
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:23,150
Alright.

1479
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:24,690
400...

1480
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,690
Okay, I did like 268 in repair.

1481
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,630
That was a lot.

1482
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,570
I was literally...

1483
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,910
Oh my god!

1484
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,170
Bro, how do you die?

1485
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,030
Okay, we were like just farming them at that point.

1486
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:37,510
Okay, wait.

1487
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:38,150
Let's see.

1488
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,130
What's the...

1489
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,150
Is there like reverse advance?

1490
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,590
Okay, there's no like kills.

1491
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,730
But like, I feel like we were just...

1492
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:48,210
We were just farming these people over and over again.

1493
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,090
Yeah, you...

1494
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,350
I farmed under...

1495
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,230
Yeah, I feel like we forgot to do our own objective.

1496
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,090
We were literally...

1497
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,170
We were literally just...

1498
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:03,510
We were literally just shooting their card for three minutes straight.

1499
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:04,730
And I was so confused.

1500
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,010
I was like...

1501
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,610
Is this how you play the game?

1502
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,370
I was so confused.

1503
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,550
I was so confused.

1504
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,730
For it...

1505
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:16,970
Yeah.

1506
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,070
We literally were like...

1507
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:19,550
On the...

1508
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,410
Cause I was like...

1509
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,050
Why...

1510
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:22,810
Why...

1511
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,510
Why aren't we moving?

1512
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:25,510
I...

1513
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,430
Like only one person...

1514
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,790
I think only one person...

1515
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:34,870
But like the thing is...

1516
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,950
Everyone was like on their own.

1517
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,470
I didn't know which one was the card.

1518
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,870
I'm so confused.

1519
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:42,210
Okay.

1520
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:43,510
Alright, nice.

1521
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,030
Alright.

1522
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,210
I don't know.

1523
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,070
I don't know how...

1524
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:46,470
I don't know.

1525
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:47,370
I think...

1526
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:48,650
Legitimately...

1527
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,210
I don't think...

1528
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,350
I think like...

1529
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:50,570
For...

1530
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,870
Mecha break...

1531
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:52,250
Uh...

1532
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,430
Almost a million damage.

1533
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,150
And no deaths.

1534
00:58:58,650 --> 00:58:58,790
Yeah.

1535
00:58:59,050 --> 00:58:59,130
Yeah.

1536
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,130
But I didn't know which...

1537
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,430
Like where the card was.

1538
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,390
I couldn't tell.

1539
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:05,650
I was so fucking confused.

1540
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,670
I couldn't tell where the card was.

1541
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,010
Wait.

1542
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,570
Which one is the other grid support?

1543
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,210
Yeah it is.

1544
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:15,590
Uh...

1545
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:16,310
Which one?

1546
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:16,910
Yeah.

1547
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,350
We turned it into TDM.

1548
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,150
Which one was the other grid support guys?

1549
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:22,370
Lumine?

1550
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:23,150
Okay.

1551
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:23,950
Let me see.

1552
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,010
Where is she?

1553
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:28,270
Lu...

1554
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:28,790
Lumine.

1555
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:29,030
Okay.

1556
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,830
We gotta see the little animation.

1557
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,600
Smokescreen.

1558
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,140
Oh.

1559
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:37,820
Interesting.

1560
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:45,780
Okay.

1561
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,200
Field maintenance.

1562
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,580
Oh.

1563
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:50,980
She has wings too.

1564
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,160
Nice.

1565
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:52,760
That's cute.

1566
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:52,860
Good.

1567
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:53,960
All right.

1568
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,180
Before we try her out.

1569
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,400
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

1570
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,260
I'll be right back guys.

1571
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:48,770
Back.

1572
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,650
I'm back everyone.

1573
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:49,970
All right.

1574
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:50,730
I'm gonna do one more.

1575
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,190
Okay.

1576
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:51,910
Uh...

1577
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:52,910
We'll do...

1578
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,090
Uh...

1579
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:54,830
One more game.

1580
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,050
Try out this other support.

1581
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,910
And then we're gonna do custom lobbies after that.

1582
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,310
So you guys wanna join in?

1583
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,610
You can download, uh...

1584
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,730
Mecha Break right now.

1585
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,610
Which is free to play.

1586
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:04,570
By clicking the link.

1587
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:05,130
Uh...

1588
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,330
That's pinned in the chat.

1589
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:08,090
Or do an exclamation point Mecha Break.

1590
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,110
And then click on my link.

1591
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:09,910
And you can dial it.

1592
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,330
Because it's a free to play game!

1593
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:11,690
Yay!

1594
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,530
Because after this game, we're gonna try to do custom lobbies chat.

1595
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:17,050
Um...

1596
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:17,210
All right.

1597
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,510
Let me try out her kit.

1598
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:20,470
I'm back.

1599
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,490
Hello, hello everyone.

1600
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:22,590
I am back.

1601
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:24,530
Uh...

1602
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:25,790
All right.

1603
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,030
Let's see what her kit is like.

1604
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:33,760
Thank you guys.

1605
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,500
Thank you for liking my new outfit.

1606
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,600
Back at school.

1607
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,040
All right.

1608
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,340
Ooh!

1609
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,540
I like how she has wings.

1610
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,540
Like that the support mechas actually look like support.

1611
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:43,760
All right.

1612
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,100
Drone launchers.

1613
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,980
Portions of friendly units age pre- and provide continuous repairs.

1614
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,960
If no effect applies to...

1615
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,160
Deploys tracking drone on an enemy unit.

1616
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,760
Wait, how do I know it's...

1617
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:01,760
Uh...

1618
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,940
That bypasses...

1619
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,260
On enemy units and damage that bypasses...

1620
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,580
That applies to the caster.

1621
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,640
I don't know which one is...

1622
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,200
Okay.

1623
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,320
Okay.

1624
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,560
I am using...

1625
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,100
Oh!

1626
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,220
An automatic...

1627
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:18,420
Oh!

1628
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:19,900
Okay.

1629
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,460
I get it.

1630
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,260
I get it.

1631
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,860
I get it now.

1632
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,560
I just have to like...

1633
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:24,960
Okay.

1634
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:25,980
So...

1635
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:26,920
Um...

1636
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,180
It's one ammo.

1637
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:28,800
One...

1638
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,240
Like they're both the same gun.

1639
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,700
But it's like whichever one...

1640
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,540
Okay.

1641
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,240
I get it.

1642
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,040
I get it.

1643
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,460
It's whichever one I like...

1644
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:37,920
Bump into.

1645
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:39,880
Yeah.

1646
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:40,700
So like...

1647
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,280
If there's like an enemy in front of me...

1648
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:42,840
It'll like...

1649
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,600
Go towards them.

1650
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,860
But if I'm on an island...

1651
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,120
Like...

1652
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,380
If I do this...

1653
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,360
And then I could...

1654
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:48,940
Wait, what?

1655
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,200
Is that not it?

1656
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,020
Or do I swap it?

1657
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,200
Or do I swap it?

1658
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,340
I have to swap?

1659
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,200
Wait, what?

1660
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,060
Wait, how do I...

1661
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:58,280
Oh!

1662
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,700
I have to swap it.

1663
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,080
Okay.

1664
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:02,380
Oh, I see.

1665
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,860
I see now.

1666
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,020
Do they stack?

1667
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,460
Or is it only two?

1668
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,840
I think it's only two.

1669
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:13,500
Yeah.

1670
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,040
Only two.

1671
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:15,400
Okay.

1672
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:16,600
Okay.

1673
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,080
Deployers a smoke stream that continuously repairs friendly use it.

1674
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,820
Deployers that continuously inflict physical damage.

1675
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,280
Revenge.

1676
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:26,760
Okay.

1677
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,000
Okay.

1678
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,740
Oh, this is a lot of swapping.

1679
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,160
Oh...

1680
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:39,780
Okay.

1681
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,180
Yeah, this is a...

1682
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:43,940
A lot...

1683
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,120
Uh...

1684
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,920
There's a lot of...

1685
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,900
Uh...

1686
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,920
There's a lot of thinking for this.

1687
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,220
Yeah, like...

1688
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,300
It's like basically a lot of shit going on.

1689
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:54,760
Hahaha!

1690
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,460
Sagger while increasing.

1691
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,140
Cancels.

1692
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:01,840
Immolite.

1693
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:02,860
Disrupts enemies fire.

1694
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:03,540
Press...

1695
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,160
Oh my god.

1696
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,220
Yeah, this is a lot...

1697
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,800
Like a lot of micromanaging for sure.

1698
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,600
Like if I want to do support and stuff.

1699
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,800
And then I just spam everything.

1700
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:12,900
And then I'd be like...

1701
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,880
Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

1702
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:14,940
Pew pew pew pew pew.

1703
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:15,580
Pew pew pew pew.

1704
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:15,640
Hahaha!

1705
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,540
Oh, there's a lot.

1706
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:19,980
Yeah.

1707
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,500
It's definitely gonna get...

1708
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,380
A little complex.

1709
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:22,780
I'll try.

1710
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:23,560
I'll try it out.

1711
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,280
There's a lot of thinking.

1712
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:25,720
Complete.

1713
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:28,520
Yeah.

1714
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,500
If you're forcing this, you need to use Crow.

1715
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,240
Otherwise, hope your teammates can save you.

1716
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,020
Yeah, this is a...

1717
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,600
A lot of thinking for sure.

1718
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:37,540
Uh...

1719
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:37,880
We'll try...

1720
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,180
I think I'm gonna get like...

1721
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,180
Fucking...

1722
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:40,780
Uh...

1723
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,460
Overwhelmed.

1724
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:42,880
100%.

1725
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,620
I feel like.

1726
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,980
I think my...

1727
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,420
I'm gonna get overloaded with info for this.

1728
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,360
I'm...

1729
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,060
I think so.

1730
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,320
Yeah, a lot of positioning too.

1731
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,140
I think a lot of them are like close...

1732
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,680
You have to use like close range too.

1733
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,980
For like the corruption stuff.

1734
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
So it's gonna be like a lot of thinking.

1735
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,580
For this game mode in general.

1736
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,640
Which might be bad.

1737
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,400
Hahaha!

1738
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,360
Cuz...

1739
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,660
Cuz I don't think.

1740
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:10,560
Hahaha!

1741
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,160
I don't think.

1742
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,180
So I don't know.

1743
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,280
Possibly.

1744
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:19,620
Hahaha!

1745
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,020
Alright.

1746
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,180
Lumine is here.

1747
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:24,880
Ready to strike.

1748
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:25,800
Narukami.

1749
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,200
Ready to strike.

1750
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,340
Ready to strike.

1751
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,580
Alright.

1752
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,260
I'm gonna look at your...

1753
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,320
I'm gonna analyze you.

1754
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,520
Oh, it's cuz we're in bronze.

1755
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,880
That's like 8 total kill.

1756
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:39,340
Hahaha!

1757
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:40,760
Panther.

1758
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,920
Ready to strike.

1759
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,160
Go bang.

1760
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:43,780
Alright.

1761
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,100
How many games have you played?

1762
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,380
Oh, we're all in bronze ELO.

1763
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,480
Hello everybody.

1764
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,240
Wait, how the fuck did that other guy join my lobby that one time?

1765
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,420
The fucking GM guy.

1766
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,240
What the fuck?

1767
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,620
How did he hack his way in?

1768
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,600
I'm in the lobby with actual bronze players.

1769
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,600
I need to stand.

1770
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,520
I need to stand.

1771
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,360
Oh, my brain is gonna be so overwhelmed.

1772
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,380
Yeah, thank you for the hundred biddies.

1773
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,140
Thank you, thank you.

1774
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,180
Hi from Anime Expo.

1775
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:14,500
Hello!

1776
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,560
Also Tatsu, thank you for tier one sub.

1777
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,580
Thank you.

1778
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,840
Secure two out of three rounds of attack to suppress the enemy.

1779
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,980
Alright, here we go.

1780
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:25,760
Here we go.

1781
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,880
My brain- my brain is already overwhelmed.

1782
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,220
Like we're- like thinking about the things I have to do.

1783
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:37,680
I'm already- I'm already like- Oh shit.

1784
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,120
Like I'm thinking about it.

1785
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,700
Get me in.

1786
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,380
Let me in!

1787
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,080
The common area is divided.

1788
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,920
Eliminate eight enemies to win the round.

1789
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,360
The first squad to win- Oh, okay.

1790
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,220
It's elimination.

1791
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,200
Let's do this!

1792
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,120
Oh my god.

1793
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,220
Why can't my objectives just be elimination?

1794
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,620
Let's do this!

1795
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,200
Here I go!

1796
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,580
Here I go!

1797
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:02,660
Here I go!

1798
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,320
Here I go!

1799
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,920
Why did they win Ungabunga?

1800
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,620
Okay, no.

1801
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:10,320
You don't understand.

1802
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:16,000
It can't all just- Despite how much I would love it to just be Ungabunga.

1803
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:17,240
Sometimes.

1804
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,220
Oh my god.

1805
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,220
Oh my god.

1806
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:25,320
Oh my god!

1807
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:25,940
I'm already overwound!

1808
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,320
I'm already overwound!

1809
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,390
Oh my god.

1810
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:44,130
Guys, I'm already overwhelmed!

1811
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,110
She's scared.

1812
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:57,010
I can't, I can't.

1813
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:00,250
Okay, holy shit.

1814
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:02,650
Just press the button.

1815
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:05,050
I'm so healthy.

1816
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,290
Okay, guys.

1817
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:13,710
Okay, I might, may or may not, may or may not like this character.

1818
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:20,610
After you die, cause I went in corruption mode for one second.

1819
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,890
That's out.

1820
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:25,670
Apparently.

1821
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:26,830
Wait.

1822
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:29,710
There we go.

1823
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,170
Oh my god, he DC'd.

1824
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,430
Guys, this is my time.

1825
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,530
This is my time to shine.

1826
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:36,970
He DC'd.

1827
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:42,170
This is it.

1828
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,710
Oh my god!

1829
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:47,530
Oh my god!

1830
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,100
What the fuck?!

1831
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:52,480
Oh!

1832
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,240
Oh, is everybody shooting me?!

1833
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,280
Oh no!

1834
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,660
Oh my god!

1835
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,020
Oh my god!

1836
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:04,480
Oh my god, please!

1837
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,000
Somebody!

1838
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,620
Oh, you're point!

1839
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,060
You're point, support!

1840
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,720
Oh my god!

1841
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,320
Oh

1842
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,840
my god!

1843
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,940
Oh my god!

1844
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,900
Oh my god!

1845
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,380
Oh my god!

1846
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:22,380
Please!

1847
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,180
Get me out of here!

1848
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,420
That's it, I'm angry!

1849
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,700
I'm angry!

1850
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,040
I'm angry!

1851
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,380
I am...

1852
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,440
I'm...

1853
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,660
I'm angry now!

1854
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,540
I'm so...

1855
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,720
I don't know, I've never played this map before, to be fair.

1856
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,840
So I'm like, a lot more...

1857
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,140
Guys, I don't think we're gonna win this round.

1858
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:47,260
Oh my god.

1859
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,700
I don't know.

1860
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,840
I can't tell.

1861
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,100
I can't tell.

1862
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:53,220
Please!

1863
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,680
AHHHHH!

1864
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:59,470
That's

1865
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:11,740
a person!

1866
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,260
Oh my god!

1867
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,200
I swear to god!

1868
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,660
Oh my god, please!

1869
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,440
Oh my god!

1870
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:21,780
Oh my god!

1871
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,480
Oh my god, please, for the love of god!

1872
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,680
I'm gonna...

1873
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,740
I'm gonna stay near you!

1874
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:33,640
I...

1875
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,840
I get her!

1876
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,320
Bro, it's fine!

1877
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,040
I'm fine!

1878
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:39,660
I'm fine!

1879
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:40,620
Napkins, thank you!

1880
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,540
Within Twitch Prime, thank you!

1881
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,300
Thank you!

1882
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,960
Thank you!

1883
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,420
Bro!

1884
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,280
What do I do?

1885
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,100
What do I...

1886
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,740
This is fine!

1887
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,740
Bro, I can't even go into corruption mode!

1888
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,840
I'm fucking getting hunted down like crazy!

1889
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:00,980
That's crazy!

1890
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,160
That's crazy!

1891
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,040
Oh, bro!

1892
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,180
We're gonna...

1893
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,420
We're gonna hang out together!

1894
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,140
We're gonna...

1895
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,400
I'm gonna hang out with you together!

1896
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,220
Don't worry!

1897
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,460
We're gonna...

1898
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:15,740
We're gonna...

1899
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,200
Oh my god!

1900
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:16,740
This is it!

1901
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,080
This is it!

1902
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:19,960
Oh my god!

1903
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:20,660
This is it!

1904
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,280
Oh my god!

1905
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,460
This is it!

1906
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:24,480
Oh my god!

1907
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,880
Oh my god!

1908
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:26,820
Oh my god!

1909
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,000
No way!

1910
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,100
Oh my god!

1911
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:29,880
Get me out of this open!

1912
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:30,960
Get me out of here!

1913
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,100
Get me out!

1914
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,840
Oh my...

1915
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,440
Get me out of here!

1916
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,620
Oh my god.

1917
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:36,740
Get me out of here.

1918
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,780
Get me out of here.

1919
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,920
I can't leave it.

1920
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,240
Oh my god, get me out of here.

1921
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,460
Where's my team?

1922
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,700
Where is this?

1923
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,400
Where are they?

1924
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,440
I can't stop.

1925
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,640
I keep getting haunted.

1926
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,420
I'm running around.

1927
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,520
Where's the safety?

1928
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,920
Oh my god.

1929
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,960
Oh my god.

1930
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:02,900
Holy shit.

1931
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,340
I'm literally just running.

1932
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,120
I'm just dodging everything.

1933
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,420
I'm dodging everything possible.

1934
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,960
It's actually crazy.

1935
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,860
My entire life is just survive.

1936
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,080
I'm just trying to survive right now.

1937
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:22,640
Don't worry, I got you.

1938
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,980
I don't know for how long.

1939
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,700
But I got you.

1940
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,000
Bro.

1941
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:31,420
Oh my god.

1942
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,940
I swear I can't even... I can't even do corruption mode.

1943
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:35,460
Okay, wait.

1944
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,820
Maybe unless... Okay, no.

1945
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,520
It's actually not a good idea.

1946
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,320
At all.

1947
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,940
It's not a good idea.

1948
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,020
You guys better be shooting.

1949
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:52,260
You guys better be doing something because I don't know what's going on.

1950
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,540
Oh my god.

1951
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:54,600
I... Oh my god.

1952
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:55,700
Please.

1953
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:56,620
Please.

1954
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:56,740
Please.

1955
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,400
You have two heels.

1956
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,020
Please.

1957
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,820
I'm doing everything I can to keep you up.

1958
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,000
I'm... I'm... I have not stopped moving.

1959
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,500
I... Guys, the only way to live is just to keep flying.

1960
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,000
Just keep flying.

1961
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,020
Oh my god.

1962
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,240
Oh my god.

1963
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:14,820
We did it.

1964
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,040
Oh my god.

1965
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:16,420
We did it.

1966
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,560
Okay.

1967
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:20,220
Okay.

1968
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:20,380
Okay.

1969
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,380
Maybe I can do one.

1970
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:22,340
Okay.

1971
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,140
Oh my god.

1972
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:24,820
I stopped.

1973
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,660
I... I had... I hesitated.

1974
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,520
I asked.

1975
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,080
Oh my god.

1976
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:28,820
What am I doing?

1977
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:29,560
No.

1978
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,080
No.

1979
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:30,620
No.

1980
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:30,660
No.

1981
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:31,820
Okay.

1982
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:32,240
It's fine.

1983
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,320
At least she's in this track.

1984
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,360
Just keep flying.

1985
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,120
Just keep flying.

1986
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,200
Nothing can hurt you if you just keep flying.

1987
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:48,600
I mean... Nothing can hurt you.

1988
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,780
Jus keep flying.

1989
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:52,580
Here we go.

1990
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:53,920
There we go.

1991
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,160
Just keep flying.

1992
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,280
We got this!

1993
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,680
Oh, shit!

1994
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:03,940
It's fine.

1995
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,660
Oh my god, I was like, freaking out.

1996
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:06,440
Okay.

1997
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,100
I don't like this character.

1998
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,580
I don't like this character.

1999
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,280
He dodged us!

2000
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,840
I don't know!

2001
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:20,920
At the moment, I never stopped moving.

2002
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,100
I never stopped moving.

2003
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,120
And that was, like, the only way for me to live.

2004
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,760
Wait, bro, like, I just... I never stopped.

2005
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,860
I never stopped moving.

2006
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:42,400
The moment I stood still, for one second, I get, like, fucking shot at.

2007
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,740
If I ever... Look at this!

2008
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,160
Like, what is this?

2009
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,600
What is that?

2010
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:48,620
Okay, look.

2011
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,840
What the fuck?

2012
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:53,840
What?

2013
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,620
What am I going through?

2014
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,740
What am I going...

2015
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,040
That's how it is.

2016
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,520
I totally...

2017
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,940
That was terrible.

2018
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,480
That was actually...

2019
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,820
That was actually, like...

2020
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:14,000
That was so miserable.

2021
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,140
Playing that character.

2022
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,100
Oh my god.

2023
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,960
I did...

2024
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,440
I was so...

2025
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,820
I did so much healing, too.

2026
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,640
I...

2027
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,000
I...

2028
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:30,100
I got blasted by everybody.

2029
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,580
But I still...

2030
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,680
I still did.

2031
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,680
Bro, this guy took a million damage.

2032
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,600
Oh my god.

2033
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,460
Well done.

2034
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:41,760
Okay.

2035
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:42,440
All right.

2036
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,640
I know I said I would do...

2037
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,200
But I need to play a game with DPS.

2038
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:47,800
I can't.

2039
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:48,720
That...

2040
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:52,180
I need to play a game with DPS after that.

2041
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,340
That was fucking crazy.

2042
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,720
That was actually crazy.

2043
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,900
I can't.

2044
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,200
Get her.

2045
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,960
I felt like I couldn't...

2046
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,880
The moment I stopped moving...

2047
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,840
Like, I legitimately just got like...

2048
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,340
You know, like...

2049
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,720
Like a thumb just came down and just squished me.

2050
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:14,960
That's...

2051
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,000
That's how it felt like.

2052
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,540
I earned the DPS run here.

2053
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,820
I deserve to play DPS after what happened to me.

2054
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:23,560
I...

2055
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,120
I deserve this.

2056
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,400
I felt like an ant in that world.

2057
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,980
Like the thumb was just ready to squish me.

2058
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,840
And I was just running away from the giant ass thumb.

2059
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,620
Like, I couldn't...

2060
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,900
I couldn't even use the corruption mode.

2061
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,420
Because like, everybody was shooting me.

2062
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,980
Oh, this guy's gonna play Luminae.

2063
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,720
Fucking good luck, buddy.

2064
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,420
Good fucking luck.

2065
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,260
That's the guy that hates themselves.

2066
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,800
They hate themselves right now.

2067
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,560
Alright, here we go.

2068
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,820
I'm ready.

2069
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,600
I'm actually...

2070
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,640
I'm a lot more ready than that support.

2071
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:18,400
Bro, okay.

2072
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:18,880
The other...

2073
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,640
What's the other support?

2074
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,440
The pen...

2075
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,640
Whatever her name is.

2076
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:22,840
She was like...

2077
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,800
I didn't know what I was doing.

2078
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,220
But like, I felt more safe with her.

2079
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,540
I felt like...

2080
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,660
I could actually like...

2081
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,260
Fight back.

2082
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,200
Penaka.

2083
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:32,560
Yeah.

2084
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,060
I felt like I could...

2085
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,660
I could actually like...

2086
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:35,840
Sort of.

2087
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,740
And I had walls.

2088
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,060
Alright, here we go.

2089
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,160
I love...

2090
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,980
I love this character.

2091
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:47,720
I don't know.

2092
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:48,980
She's really fun to play.

2093
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:55,750
Oh my god.

2094
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:56,510
See the hood...

2095
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,350
The guy...

2096
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:58,570
The hood's mech.

2097
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,390
And their pilot.

2098
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,510
The customization's pretty good, though.

2099
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,090
I like the customization options.

2100
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:11,470
Alright, come on.

2101
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:12,290
Load in, everybody.

2102
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:14,130
Approach Coralright Extractors.

2103
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:16,050
This will be the first to reach specific numbers.

2104
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:17,510
Oh my god.

2105
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:18,730
Every time I actually do that.

2106
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,630
Like, every time it's a kill objective...

2107
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:22,850
Um...

2108
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,230
Game, I'm not a DPS.

2109
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:29,220
Alright.

2110
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:33,580
Dismantled Coralright Extractors to prevent Coralright Pulse Storm.

2111
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,300
Alright.

2112
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,460
Here we go.

2113
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,260
That's right.

2114
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:46,700
Alright.

2115
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:47,080
Come on.

2116
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,480
Let's go.

2117
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,980
I want a frag!

2118
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,620
I'm mad!

2119
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,760
I'm here to frag!

2120
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,450
Oh wait.

2121
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,530
Someone else has to do objective, not me, though.

2122
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,090
Guys, I can't.

2123
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:05,770
Ha ha ha ha!

2124
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:06,710
Ha ha ha!

2125
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,930
Someone else has to do objective, and it's not me!

2126
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:15,410
Oh my god.

2127
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:15,690
Please.

2128
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:16,270
Please!

2129
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,570
I'm just a sniper!

2130
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,890
You cannot expect a sniper to do that.

2131
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:26,610
Oh.

2132
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:27,510
Fuck.

2133
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:29,310
Here we go.

2134
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:32,270
Come on.

2135
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:35,410
Come on.

2136
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,150
Get over here!

2137
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:38,650
Oh my god.

2138
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:39,110
Get over here.

2139
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:39,710
You're solo.

2140
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,170
You're actually solo.

2141
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,130
Here we go.

2142
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:45,090
He's one hit.

2143
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:45,730
Stereo.

2144
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:49,790
Because someone else has to do objective, and it's not me.

2145
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,780
Come on, guys!

2146
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,430
Guys, come on!

2147
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:03,630
Oh, there's another Nurukami here, too.

2148
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:07,790
Ha ha ha.

2149
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,250
Oh, where are you?

2150
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:12,610
Over here.

2151
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,210
I see you.

2152
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:15,290
Where did she go?

2153
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,690
I don't see you anymore.

2154
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:20,610
Oh, shit.

2155
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,410
Where did she go?

2156
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:24,190
Where did the other Nurukami go?

2157
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,120
I know that I'm not supposed to frontline.

2158
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,360
But, like, it's just more fun.

2159
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,730
Oh my god.

2160
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,350
Are you serious?

2161
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:40,790
Are you serious?

2162
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:42,610
Please!

2163
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:43,650
Damn!

2164
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,410
Can you do the objective?

2165
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:49,050
Please!

2166
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:52,530
Frontline is just more fun.

2167
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:56,710
I don't know.

2168
01:21:56,930 --> 01:22:00,690
I find the frontline fights more fun as Nurukami.

2169
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:02,010
It's more...

2170
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:02,510
I don't know.

2171
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:04,390
I guess because I'm closer to the action.

2172
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:09,270
I don't have ammo.

2173
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:10,570
Ha ha ha ha.

2174
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:13,970
Fine.

2175
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:14,830
Fine.

2176
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,650
I guess I can do this.

2177
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,900
Guys, please!

2178
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,380
Can someone else...

2179
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,260
Oh my god.

2180
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,600
Oh my...

2181
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,840
My team doesn't like doing objectives, guys.

2182
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,660
There we go.

2183
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,360
He kneeled.

2184
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,340
Oh my god.

2185
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:41,800
That would...

2186
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,880
That would've been so cool if that hit.

2187
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,660
There we go.

2188
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:46,760
That's fine.

2189
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,840
No help.

2190
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:50,460
No help.

2191
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,500
Please, team.

2192
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,300
Team, please!

2193
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,000
Team...

2194
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:02,960
Team...

2195
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,240
Team, please!

2196
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,500
There we go.

2197
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:09,960
Fine.

2198
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,280
I'll play non...

2199
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:11,780
I'll play...

2200
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,160
You're over here, Panther.

2201
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,480
I see you.

2202
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:23,770
Oh, it would be cool if I hit that.

2203
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:25,490
Wait, where's the... Guys!

2204
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:29,530
Guys, the boss is already here!

2205
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:32,110
Oh my god, guys, please!

2206
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:34,490
Are we all

2207
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:39,960
so...

2208
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,440
Woo!

2209
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,800
Oh, he got the wrong one.

2210
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,060
Wrong one, sucker.

2211
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,780
That's right, that was my clone.

2212
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,240
Are you serious?

2213
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,840
Oh my god, okay, I distracted him.

2214
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:55,280
Okay, nice.

2215
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:01,960
Okay.

2216
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,220
Nice, all right, we're five.

2217
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,280
I was gonna say, no one is near... no one's at the objective.

2218
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,180
It's actually crazy.

2219
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,080
Okay.

2220
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,760
I wanted two at least over there.

2221
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:19,940
Hello, guys.

2222
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:21,040
Okay.

2223
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,280
Oh, no.

2224
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:32,160
I have to use my non-sniper arm for this.

2225
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,200
Okay, nice.

2226
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,020
Whoa!

2227
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:37,300
Whoa!

2228
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,320
Where did he come from?

2229
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,720
I, like, unscoped.

2230
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,920
But I think he missed.

2231
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,040
I unscoped, and he was right next to me.

2232
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,280
I think that guy actually missed.

2233
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,180
There's no way.

2234
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,240
I was like, where did he come from?

2235
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,520
There's no way.

2236
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:58,280
There's no way.

2237
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,640
That guy did not miss.

2238
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,400
Okay.

2239
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,120
Nice.

2240
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,100
Don't worry, they don't know.

2241
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,680
They'll never expect me on the ground.

2242
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,220
That's the best part.

2243
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,440
They don't...

2244
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,020
They don't expect me on the ground.

2245
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,240
Okay.

2246
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,280
Where's the other deploy...

2247
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:28,760
Okay, guys.

2248
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,180
Come on.

2249
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:34,350
Come on.

2250
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:37,930
What the fuck?

2251
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,310
Who do I shoot at?

2252
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:40,150
Oh, her.

2253
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:42,490
I was gonna say, like, who...

2254
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:45,790
Okay, nice.

2255
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,750
That's fucking right.

2256
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:50,490
Oh, that's a clone.

2257
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:52,730
Oh.

2258
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:54,750
I don't think he knows.

2259
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,600
I don't know what she was doing.

2260
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,520
She just sit there?

2261
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:14,580
Did she think I...

2262
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:16,880
Oh, she thought I was the clone, maybe.

2263
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,620
Maybe she thought...

2264
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,420
I don't know.

2265
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:22,160
I don't ask questions anymore.

2266
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,760
I don't know.

2267
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,540
Did she think I was the clone?

2268
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:28,780
Maybe?

2269
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,240
Okay.

2270
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:38,480
There we go.

2271
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,040
I'll grab two here.

2272
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,920
Bro, I'm not like...

2273
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,460
Oh, there she is.

2274
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:52,640
Where's the other...

2275
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,620
I know you're here.

2276
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:54,320
I know.

2277
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,260
Oh, shit!

2278
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,340
Okay, okay.

2279
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,380
She almost baited me.

2280
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,500
She actually almost got me there.

2281
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,360
Okay, that was good.

2282
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:05,980
That was...

2283
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:07,700
They learned.

2284
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,640
They learned.

2285
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,900
They learned.

2286
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,100
They knew.

2287
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:13,840
They knew.

2288
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,160
They knew.

2289
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:15,040
This time.

2290
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,060
Fight.

2291
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:18,560
Fight.

2292
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:18,960
Fight.

2293
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,160
Alright.

2294
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:22,820
Nice.

2295
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,520
Okay, but I really need heals, though.

2296
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,620
Heals, don't go.

2297
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:30,940
Please.

2298
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,760
Oh, thank God.

2299
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:36,700
Actually, no.

2300
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,420
Oh, my God.

2301
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:40,720
Please.

2302
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,620
Oh, my God.

2303
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:42,360
He wants me.

2304
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,140
He wants me so bad.

2305
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,140
Oh, I know you're here.

2306
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:50,510
He knows.

2307
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:52,050
Oh, he knows.

2308
01:27:57,990 --> 01:27:58,770
Oh, he knows.

2309
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,820
He knows what I have.

2310
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,280
He knows what I have.

2311
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,100
Yeah.

2312
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,600
I know what you are.

2313
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:36,700
Okay.

2314
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:40,880
Okay.

2315
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,840
Nice.

2316
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:44,720
Oh, my God.

2317
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,020
We actually turned it around.

2318
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,160
Oh, my God.

2319
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,060
We actually turned it around.

2320
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,660
Way to throw that one away.

2321
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,600
Oh, my God.

2322
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,540
I did not expect us to turn that around, thank god.

2323
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,000
Nice, who was it?

2324
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:14,350
AHHHHH!

2325
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,920
Oh my god.

2326
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:31,560
Tiny bites.

2327
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,740
For tiny faces.

2328
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,480
Little bites, sorry.

2329
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,240
Little bites are little faces.

2330
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,580
Oh, thank you for the kudos, Dildo.

2331
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:41,680
Thank you.

2332
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,320
We won.

2333
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:46,120
GG.

2334
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:47,920
Yeah, I was talking shit to them.

2335
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,260
Love you.

2336
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,240
Kiss me.

2337
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,800
Love you too.

2338
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,120
Oh my god, I love you too.

2339
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,800
Make out with us.

2340
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:56,240
Yeah.

2341
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,800
Two men, two men.

2342
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,720
Same shit, different day.

2343
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:10,900
Alright, that guy, that guy deserves the kudos.

2344
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:11,560
Where is he?

2345
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,200
Dildo.

2346
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:13,920
Dildo.

2347
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,000
Dildo.

2348
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,120
Dildo.

2349
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:16,520
Dildo.

2350
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,180
Dildo.

2351
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,280
Dildo.

2352
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,120
Dildo.

2353
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,240
You're not even a...

2354
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,060
Wait!

2355
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,200
Oh my...

2356
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,560
Wait, that was their Nurukami?

2357
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:36,820
Bro!

2358
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,820
It's so sad.

2359
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:42,720
Bro!

2360
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,080
That was their Nurukami.

2361
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:51,700
I, like, copied their strat because I was like, I want a frontline, but I guess I can do range.

2362
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:53,970
Uh...

2363
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,640
That's, I had no...

2364
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,540
It was because I looked straight at him.

2365
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,120
I didn't run away.

2366
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,180
What do you mean?

2367
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:08,180
I let him fully charge the Sniper ran on me because I was like, I'm not, I was like, I'm not threatened by it.

2368
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:11,020
That's crazy.

2369
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:11,440
Crazy.

2370
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,180
Oh my god.

2371
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,560
That's actually insane.

2372
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,060
Alright.

2373
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,420
Alright, let's do custom lobbies, guys.

2374
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:24,800
Yay.

2375
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:30,300
They are just learning.

2376
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,680
Alright, let's see.

2377
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,980
Tactical station.

2378
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,920
Custom room.

2379
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,660
Alright, I'm creating a room right now.

2380
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,140
We'll do random.

2381
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,100
Wait, is this arena?

2382
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,700
Sorry, let me reset this room.

2383
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,400
Sorry, guys.

2384
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,520
We're resetting this room.

2385
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,560
You gotta try again.

2386
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,880
It's time to try again.

2387
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:03,700
Okay, I wanna do... Okay, random map.

2388
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,860
Operation version.

2389
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,060
Okay, random map.

2390
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:07,800
Random map.

2391
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,660
Operation.

2392
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,680
Okay, we'll do...

2393
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,360
We'll do Operation version first.

2394
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,920
So that more people can play.

2395
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:13,940
Boop.

2396
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:15,540
Alright, here we go.

2397
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,600
Alright, now we... Now you guys can join in.

2398
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,820
I don't know which one to play.

2399
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:21,900
Uh...

2400
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:22,300
Let's see.

2401
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,540
Yeah, this is the code.

2402
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:23,940
Room number.

2403
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:25,200
489817.

2404
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:25,960
Okay, it's done.

2405
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:26,880
Okay, that was fast.

2406
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:27,460
Wait.

2407
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:28,640
What map is this?

2408
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:31,560
What map?

2409
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:35,680
Okay, actually... No, let's... Let's get... Let's get... Uh...

2410
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,280
I just realized.

2411
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:36,960
I was thinking.

2412
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,860
I don't wanna do... Okay, actually, no.

2413
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:39,700
It's gonna be forever.

2414
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,160
Let's do a map that's not forever.

2415
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:43,260
Um...

2416
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:46,500
Which one was the... Which one was the...

2417
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,400
Cart, guys?

2418
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,620
Which one was the cart?

2419
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:50,740
Because I liked that one.

2420
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:51,840
That one was fun.

2421
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,740
I just remembered that they have objective... Which one's... Oh, wait.

2422
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,640
Actually, to make it easier... Which one are objective maps?

2423
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:00,520
Because fuck that shit.

2424
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:02,720
Uh...

2425
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,860
Palm Bay Harbor?

2426
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,080
Okay, which one are the objective maps?

2427
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,200
Because we're getting rid of those.

2428
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:11,560
We're gonna get rid of those.

2429
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,240
Cart is not objective.

2430
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,040
Okay, the one where it's like points.

2431
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,060
Oh, launch site and harbor cards.

2432
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,100
Okay, launch site.

2433
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:21,500
Which one did we do?

2434
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:22,880
I think we didn't do launch site yet.

2435
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:23,720
Alright, we'll do that.

2436
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,600
Alright, start.

2437
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,200
Alright.

2438
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:28,960
I don't know.

2439
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:29,720
Okay, I wanna swap.

2440
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:31,500
Uh, we'll try...

2441
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,480
We'll try...

2442
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,340
Let's try the Aquila sniper again.

2443
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:37,600
I'll try her.

2444
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,520
Aquila!

2445
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:41,860
Aquila!

2446
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,180
I'm ready to strike.

2447
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:49,850
Yeah, this is NA servers.

2448
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:50,910
Because I'm in NA.

2449
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,630
Bro.

2450
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:57,130
You think I'm gonna debuff myself in my own server?

2451
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:59,510
It's just like...

2452
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,950
Alright, guys.

2453
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,990
Let me start...

2454
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:04,230
Let me start playing on 200 ping on my own server.

2455
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:06,350
Like...

2456
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,630
The logic.

2457
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:12,050
Let me just...

2458
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:12,330
I don't know.

2459
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:14,490
Let's swap my server to Asia real quick.

2460
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:15,470
Because, you know...

2461
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:16,810
I'd like the challenge.

2462
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:23,830
Alright, I'm ready.

2463
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:33,910
Alright.

2464
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,310
I'm ready to snipe.

2465
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:39,950
Plus, I gotta make it fair, Toki.

2466
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:42,170
Aquila.

2467
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:43,090
That's me.

2468
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,390
I'm Aquila.

2469
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:46,430
Hello, everybody.

2470
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:47,570
I'm ready.

2471
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:49,090
I'm ready.

2472
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:50,350
Squirt dish payload.

2473
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:52,130
Alright.

2474
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:53,930
I now know the objective, guys.

2475
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:56,590
I already forgot how to play this character, though.

2476
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:00,150
I'm gonna play this character again.

2477
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,110
Oh my god!

2478
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:07,490
Oh my god!

2479
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:09,090
He's just twirling!

2480
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:12,050
Oh my god.

2481
01:35:12,210 --> 01:35:12,930
He's just twirling.

2482
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:14,890
Guys, what was one?

2483
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:15,810
I don't remember.

2484
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:16,490
Oh wait.

2485
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,210
Oh, I remember now.

2486
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:20,150
Oh my god.

2487
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:22,230
Oh my god.

2488
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:26,010
It's fine.

2489
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:26,510
I got you.

2490
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:27,390
I got you.

2491
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:28,270
Oh, it's him!

2492
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,320
It's...

2493
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,160
Oh, I don't got you anymore.

2494
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:33,960
You're not spinning anymore.

2495
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,440
Oh, you...

2496
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,420
I don't got you anymore.

2497
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,060
I'm trying my best to get you.

2498
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,080
But I think you're dead.

2499
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,200
You're so dead.

2500
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,260
You're so dead.

2501
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,760
Oh my god.

2502
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,040
He has it again?

2503
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

2504
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:52,880
You're so dead.

2505
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:55,600
Okay.

2506
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,660
I don't know how I did it.

2507
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,860
Oh, thank God.

2508
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:01,780
I got saved.

2509
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:06,360
Oh my god.

2510
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:06,700
He's one.

2511
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:07,180
He's one.

2512
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:09,500
We're fine.

2513
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,720
Oh, babe.

2514
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,220
Let it rip.

2515
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:16,940
He really let it rip.

2516
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,360
Oh my god.

2517
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:22,700
Please.

2518
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:25,140
He's spinning so much.

2519
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:25,860
Wait.

2520
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:26,320
I got it.

2521
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,680
Can't spin now.

2522
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:28,560
That's right.

2523
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:30,580
Can't spin now.

2524
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,140
What you gotta do?

2525
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,640
Stop the spin.

2526
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:38,400
Okay.

2527
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:44,720
I'm okay.

2528
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:46,640
I'm okay.

2529
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:47,660
I feel so healthy.

2530
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,260
Guys, I don't feel healthy anymore.

2531
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,420
I don't...

2532
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,540
I feel so healthy.

2533
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,480
Oh my god.

2534
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,260
Everybody is just twerling.

2535
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,180
Oh my god.

2536
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:04,860
Oh!

2537
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,220
Oh!

2538
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,380
Let me out.

2539
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:11,620
Let me out!

2540
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:13,380
Initiating ejection sequence.

2541
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,480
Oh my god.

2542
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,880
There's so many people.

2543
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:20,820
Everybody was...

2544
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:22,240
Roll out.

2545
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,440
Oh my god.

2546
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:25,800
Okay.

2547
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,080
Yeah.

2548
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:26,380
No.

2549
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,140
I was not living there.

2550
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,400
Getting in that mech.

2551
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,040
Are we pushing?

2552
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,180
I don't know.

2553
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,220
All right.

2554
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,520
I'm gonna go in there and see.

2555
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,580
Oh yeah.

2556
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,740
We're not even...

2557
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:42,160
Yeah.

2558
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,080
We're...

2559
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,100
We're a little...

2560
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,780
It's a little bit...

2561
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,440
It's a little bit scary right now.

2562
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,060
Fine.

2563
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:53,740
I stunned him.

2564
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:54,860
I did my jump.

2565
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:58,280
I did my jump.

2566
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,340
Oh my god.

2567
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,900
Oh my god.

2568
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,000
Wow!

2569
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,020
Okay.

2570
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,060
Guys.

2571
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,220
Oh my god.

2572
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:13,520
Okay.

2573
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:13,920
Goodbye.

2574
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:15,120
Goodbye.

2575
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:16,340
Goodbye.

2576
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,980
I need a...

2577
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:20,280
Please.

2578
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:21,000
I need healing.

2579
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,300
I need healing.

2580
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:30,500
No!

2581
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:31,960
I need healing!

2582
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,780
Support, please!

2583
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:39,460
I need healing!

2584
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,360
Oh my god, who is Qukies?

2585
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,340
I'm getting tired.

2586
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,080
Save me some Lord Saad.

2587
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:51,660
What do I do?

2588
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,100
A DDS.

2589
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,660
I do it.

2590
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:55,340
I do.

2591
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,900
Why should I play Durukavi?

2592
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:57,660
I do it.

2593
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:59,220
Why did I get out of my main?

2594
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,340
Why did I ever swap off my main?

2595
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:10,380
I knew it.

2596
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:15,920
Oh my god.

2597
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,420
So low.

2598
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:20,180
Nice.

2599
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,420
That's goddamn right, you clown.

2600
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,680
That's goddamn right.

2601
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,710
Okay, I'm just gonna stay up here.

2602
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:35,830
I feel right safe.

2603
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:42,430
I feel... I want to be safe today.

2604
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,510
I...

2605
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:47,810
Oh, they tried to... Oh my god, they tried to flank me.

2606
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:50,170
Oh my god.

2607
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:51,530
Oh my god.

2608
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:54,070
Oh, they tried to flank me.

2609
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:55,990
They almost got me.

2610
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:56,690
They got me.

2611
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:57,370
They got me.

2612
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:58,570
They actually got me.

2613
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:00,290
I don't know what's hitting me, but they got me.

2614
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:02,130
I don't know what's hitting me.

2615
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:02,790
Please.

2616
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:03,810
Medic.

2617
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:05,330
Medic.

2618
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:06,730
Please.

2619
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:08,210
Medic.

2620
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:09,610
I don't know.

2621
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:10,050
I don't know.

2622
01:40:10,450 --> 01:40:10,870
I need healing.

2623
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,490
I need healing.

2624
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:12,530
I need healing!

2625
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:14,390
What's the controls?

2626
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:16,870
What's the controls for it?

2627
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:21,790
Guys, I don't know what the controls are for I need healing.

2628
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:25,190
I'm trapped.

2629
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:27,570
Please, there's one.

2630
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:35,050
Please!

2631
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:36,610
I'm over here!

2632
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:37,830
I need healing!

2633
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,860
Holy shit, that guy is human.

2634
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,160
Oh my god.

2635
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:53,360
Where's my... Where is... Where are they?

2636
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:00,120
Okay, that's fine.

2637
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,120
One HP and a dream.

2638
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:10,890
Oh my god.

2639
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:13,530
Oh my god, I'm just...

2640
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:16,090
Please, I need healing myself.

2641
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:18,230
I don't know how I live for this life.

2642
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,210
I don't know.

2643
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:23,050
I should be dead.

2644
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:25,870
I guess my tiff was greatly exaggerated.

2645
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:27,990
Oh my god.

2646
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:29,250
Is that a heal?

2647
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:31,910
Oh my god.

2648
01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:33,470
Oh my god.

2649
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:50,190
Oh my god.

2650
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:53,650
They found... I don't know how I survived that long.

2651
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:55,630
But they found me.

2652
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:59,590
I spoke too soon.

2653
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:01,830
I spoke way too soon.

2654
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:05,150
They were like...

2655
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:05,890
They were like...

2656
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,510
I got hunted down.

2657
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:10,130
Yeah, I got fucking hunted down.

2658
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:12,950
Heal dead murdered.

2659
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,600
They hunted me down.

2660
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,080
They waited until I...

2661
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,320
They waited until I felt safe.

2662
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,580
They're like...

2663
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,480
Oh, you feel safe, don't you?

2664
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,560
You feel...

2665
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,840
I felt so safe.

2666
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,180
I felt really, really safe.

2667
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,900
Oh my god.

2668
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:40,220
They're like flying everywhere.

2669
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:44,940
I don't feel safe anymore!

2670
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,960
I don't feel safe anymore!

2671
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,400
I feel...

2672
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,640
I feel...

2673
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:49,160
I feel...

2674
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,660
I feel...

2675
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,480
I don't feel safe.

2676
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,060
I really don't.

2677
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,180
Oh, please.

2678
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:10,810
Oh my god, please.

2679
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:13,670
I don't know.

2680
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:14,310
I'm just...

2681
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,670
I'm literally just flying away.

2682
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:15,690
I don't know.

2683
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:17,890
I don't know.

2684
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:18,670
I'm literally...

2685
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:21,210
Where's...

2686
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:21,630
Guys?

2687
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:23,270
Where's my luminaire?

2688
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,590
Luminaire Luigi!

2689
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:31,970
I'm trying to like take cover, but I can't!

2690
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:36,170
OH MY GOD!

2691
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:37,850
Are you fucking kidding me?

2692
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:39,690
I literally can't fucking...

2693
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:41,490
FREEZE!

2694
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,900
Just okay.

2695
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,420
I just need...

2696
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:48,140
I need a chill.

2697
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:49,180
I...

2698
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:49,820
I...

2699
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,760
I'm shooting me down!

2700
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:57,700
Oh my god!

2701
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,720
I'm actually gonna do this.

2702
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:01,680
Oh...

2703
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,180
The hunter...

2704
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:04,880
Has become the hunted.

2705
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,180
That's fucking right you are!

2706
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:12,740
Not so badass now!

2707
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:13,340
Right?

2708
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,240
That's right!

2709
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:18,160
Not so badass now, are ya?

2710
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,000
That's goddamn right!

2711
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,260
That's fucking...

2712
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:28,360
That's fucking...

2713
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,180
It's not so funny now, is it?

2714
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,800
It's not that funny now!

2715
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:43,570
That's right!

2716
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:45,050
Fuck you!

2717
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:45,510
Nooo!

2718
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:48,770
Actual fuck you!

2719
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:49,630
What?

2720
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:51,150
What?

2721
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:51,890
Let's try it!

2722
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:54,190
Not so funny now!

2723
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:56,810
When they fight back!

2724
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:59,170
That's fucking right!

2725
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:01,570
That's fucking right!

2726
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,570
I fight back now!

2727
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:12,870
I see her too!

2728
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:14,470
I see her too!

2729
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,480
Oh, I know you're still around!

2730
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:34,900
Oh, you're such a bitch!

2731
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,100
Ha ha ha!

2732
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:36,660
Stupid!

2733
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:38,060
Fucker!

2734
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:40,900
Oh my god!

2735
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:41,360
We won!

2736
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:42,840
We actually won!

2737
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,100
Ha ha ha ha!

2738
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:45,000
We did!

2739
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,940
Oh, that thing!

2740
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:47,760
Ha ha ha!

2741
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,080
We actually won!

2742
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,640
Holy shit!

2743
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,660
I was just...

2744
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:53,940
Oh my god!

2745
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,600
After getting hunted down!

2746
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:56,760
Non-stop!

2747
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:58,020
Yay!

2748
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,520
I was like, yippee!

2749
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,400
I pushed the cart!

2750
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:00,800
Guys!

2751
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,760
I did it!

2752
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:02,680
I...

2753
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,240
Ha ha ha!

2754
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,300
Ha ha ha!

2755
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,880
Oh my god!

2756
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:10,600
I was just running so much!

2757
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:11,800
Ha ha ha!

2758
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:14,840
700k!

2759
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:15,640
Damn it!

2760
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,340
Take it!

2761
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,080
Like, can you blame me with the shit I just went through?

2762
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:22,260
I, like, we weren't even...

2763
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:23,600
We only had one guy!

2764
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,620
That got the, like, leaderboard!

2765
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:26,580
Like, they...

2766
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,120
Your team did not do the objectives!

2767
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,240
You're...

2768
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:30,800
Ha ha ha!

2769
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,840
You guys don't know!

2770
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,580
You guys actually had...

2771
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:35,080
The leaderboard!

2772
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:35,880
Ha ha ha!

2773
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:38,520
But you did not do the objectives!

2774
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,240
That's crazy!

2775
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,700
We should not have won that game!

2776
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,540
We should not have won!

2777
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:44,980
Ha ha ha!

2778
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,740
They were just chasing us!

2779
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:47,620
Look at...

2780
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:48,380
Holy shit!

2781
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,480
We had two players!

2782
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,240
With two million damage taken!

2783
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,900
It's about sending the message!

2784
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,120
Oh my god!

2785
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,240
Now there was a million...

2786
01:46:59,000 --> 01:46:59,180
A million...

2787
01:46:59,380 --> 01:46:59,700
Let's...

2788
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:00,680
Let's...

2789
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:01,620
Create...

2790
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,940
Let's create a...

2791
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:03,840
TDM lobby!

2792
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,200
Alright!

2793
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,000
Create room!

2794
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,080
Now it's TDM time!

2795
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:09,780
Uh...

2796
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,320
Alright!

2797
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,620
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick!

2798
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,180
I'll be right back!

2799
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:13,260
I hydrated a lot!

2800
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:14,120
Ha ha ha!

2801
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:21,980
So if you played already!

2802
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:22,680
Um...

2803
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,480
Let other drag wounds have a chance to play!

2804
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,980
Because I can only play like...

2805
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:26,520
I think like...

2806
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,840
One more after this!

2807
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:29,140
One more custom lobby!

2808
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:29,940
Alright!

2809
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,380
So if you've been in the lobby...

2810
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:31,980
And like...

2811
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:32,380
Chat!

2812
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,860
You can rack them out to me!

2813
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:34,540
If...

2814
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:36,620
You see someone that's been in the lobby before!

2815
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,740
I'm back!

2816
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:05,840
I'm back!

2817
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:06,820
I got my food too!

2818
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:07,580
So I was like...

2819
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:08,040
Grabbing that!

2820
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:08,920
That's why I came over!

2821
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:10,120
And then I disappeared again!

2822
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:10,980
Alright!

2823
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:11,500
Give me a sec!

2824
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:12,600
Let me have like...

2825
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,100
One little food break guys!

2826
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:15,880
Just a tiny bit!

2827
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:16,980
Because...

2828
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,620
Because I didn't eat anything yet!

2829
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,520
Ha ha ha!

2830
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:22,040
Just one little food break before we...

2831
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:22,840
Go game again!

2832
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:24,860
Woah!

2833
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:25,600
Woah!

2834
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:26,180
Woah, woah, woah!

2835
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:27,060
I got curry!

2836
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:28,760
Woah, woah, woah!

2837
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:28,820
Oh!

2838
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:29,720
It smells so good!

2839
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:37,500
Mmm-hmm, mmmm-hmm, mmmm...

2840
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,840
I got um...

2841
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:40,540
I got like...

2842
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:40,800
Um!

2843
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,840
Mmm, beef curry.

2844
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:43,540
Mmm.

2845
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:47,340
Japanese beef curry.

2846
01:49:52,610 --> 01:49:54,630
I haven't had this in a while, too.

2847
01:49:56,270 --> 01:49:57,210
I'm gonna treat myself.

2848
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:58,070
Oh, tonight?

2849
01:49:58,410 --> 01:49:59,350
To celebrate?

2850
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:05,870
Um... Because I haven't had, like, um, actual, like, from a birthday present to myself.

2851
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:11,490
I'm going to a Michelin star restaurant.

2852
01:50:12,170 --> 01:50:12,730
Today.

2853
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:15,650
The, like, I have a birthday present to myself.

2854
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,070
I'm treating myself.

2855
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:20,350
I haven't met a Michelin star restaurant in so long.

2856
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:22,950
Oh, wait.

2857
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:27,430
The last time, I, like, um, fucked up.

2858
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:28,650
Oh, wait, no.

2859
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:38,750
I went to one in Japan, and I fucked up, because, like, um, I wanted to go to any Michelin star restaurant, but because, like, the place I went to, I told you guys the story.

2860
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:40,410
Yeah, it was the mushroom story.

2861
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:40,910
Yeah!

2862
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:44,330
Like, and, like, I went to Japanese, like, Michelin star restaurant.

2863
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:47,810
But it's like a set menu, so you can't order individually.

2864
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:51,250
And then all I... it was mushroom season.

2865
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:54,190
And then everything they gave me was just mushroom.

2866
01:50:54,410 --> 01:50:57,410
Like, almost all the dishes were mostly mushroom.

2867
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:58,670
And I hate mushrooms.

2868
01:50:58,710 --> 01:51:00,370
I don't like mushrooms at all.

2869
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:02,630
I was like, no!

2870
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:09,220
I paid so much.

2871
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,480
And they're like, they saw me not eat a lot.

2872
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:13,320
I'm like, oh, is something wrong with the food?

2873
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,100
I was like, no, I just don't like it.

2874
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:15,540
I'm sorry.

2875
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,120
It's so, it's so good.

2876
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,360
Om yom yom.

2877
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:20,420
I feel bad.

2878
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,740
I'm like, no, no.

2879
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,720
I mean, it's so good.

2880
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,100
Om yom yom.

2881
01:51:31,130 --> 01:51:33,870
I paid so much because it's a set menu.

2882
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:42,670
Yeah, so, but yeah, this time it's different.

2883
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:43,910
This time it's different.

2884
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:46,870
It's food I actually like.

2885
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:50,470
Um, I won't say much about it.

2886
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:53,810
It's like, um, I don't want to dox myself.

2887
01:51:56,650 --> 01:52:02,170
But like, it's those types of restaurants that like, only serve like, very limited people.

2888
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:03,530
Like per day.

2889
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:08,730
So like, they only serve like, like, they only serve for like, um, very limited people.

2890
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:14,990
So like, um, so it's, it's more so of like, oh, um, and it's like, also like, set price too.

2891
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:19,290
Um, but yeah, but that's all the details I'll give.

2892
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:20,790
I'm like, looking forward to it.

2893
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:25,390
I booked this place for like, um, cause I'm like, oh my God.

2894
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:28,310
How do they, I guess like, sometimes like, how do they make their money back?

2895
01:52:28,430 --> 01:52:29,330
Like there's so little people.

2896
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:32,970
And it's just like, they only do like, like dinner.

2897
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:33,690
That's it.

2898
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:35,190
Like, like.

2899
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:40,850
You only do dinner and it's like, limited.

2900
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:43,730
But I booked it in advance for a while.

2901
01:52:44,150 --> 01:52:44,470
So.

2902
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:46,530
I'm excited.

2903
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:48,330
I'm so excited.

2904
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:49,690
I'm not gonna eat much for lunch.

2905
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:59,410
I know I ordered like, um, I only ordered like, um, um, I ordered Japanese curry, but I'm not gonna eat all of it.

2906
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:00,890
Cause I want to save my stomach for tonight.

2907
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:03,750
It must be expensive, expensive.

2908
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:07,110
Yeah.

2909
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:15,840
Yeah.

2910
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:24,460
And I made sure this time, cause it's all in English.

2911
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:30,940
I made sure that it's not, that it's not mushrooms.

2912
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,600
This time, I learned.

2913
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:41,220
I, I'm treating myself.

2914
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:44,560
And I learned that it's not, oops, all mushrooms.

2915
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:45,720
All mushrooms.

2916
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,220
All mushrooms.

2917
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,840
All mushroom season for me.

2918
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,740
Alright, one more bite.

2919
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:54,000
Sorry, this is actually really good.

2920
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:55,520
Mmm.

2921
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:00,300
Okay.

2922
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:00,860
I'm ready.

2923
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:02,880
That's really good.

2924
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,340
No, it's not.

2925
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,380
It's not depressing.

2926
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,660
I do that a lot.

2927
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:12,340
Cause I'm an only child.

2928
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,560
And like, I don't know.

2929
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,220
You don't have to socialize with people.

2930
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,100
You can just like, go and eat something nice for yourself.

2931
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:20,280
You know?

2932
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:23,960
I don't.

2933
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:25,500
Eat alone is not that bad.

2934
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:27,320
Mmm.

2935
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:32,460
Alright, here you go.

2936
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:37,360
You don't have to like, you know, socialize with people.

2937
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,840
You just enjoy the meal.

2938
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:41,320
And you can like, you know.

2939
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:45,560
You know, it's not rude to like, be on your phone and stuff too.

2940
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,000
Cause it's just, you're just by yourself.

2941
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:47,540
Like.

2942
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:49,800
So I can literally like.

2943
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:52,520
Sometimes I like, you know, watch a show or something while I'm eating.

2944
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,520
And I'm like, you know.

2945
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,760
Sometimes I rather prefer just watching a show while I'm eating.

2946
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:57,280
Like, you know?

2947
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:58,280
Alright.

2948
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:58,980
Are you guys ready?

2949
01:54:59,100 --> 01:54:59,800
Yes, we're ending.

2950
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,800
Okay, Peter's like, we can only do one game.

2951
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:02,960
So we're ending it on 3v3.

2952
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:05,940
Yes.

2953
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,900
You guys want to try out Mecha.

2954
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:10,640
I will be doing one more Mecha Break stream.

2955
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:13,560
Let's end it with Nurukami.

2956
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:14,880
That's right.

2957
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:16,920
I'm bringing out the hot girl.

2958
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:18,040
Uh.

2959
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,460
The hot one.

2960
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:26,960
Nurukami is ready to strike.

2961
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,660
That's fucking right.

2962
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:32,320
The only, yeah.

2963
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:34,480
The only issue about eating alone is that like.

2964
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:35,280
Um.

2965
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:38,120
The only times I can actually like eat hot pot.

2966
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:39,540
Or like Korean barbecue.

2967
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,540
Is if I'm like, you know, with people.

2968
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,960
And that's the worst part.

2969
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:43,360
Like.

2970
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,560
I once did Korean barbecue by myself.

2971
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:46,700
And it was so sad.

2972
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:47,760
Because I was like.

2973
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:48,640
Oh, can I like.

2974
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:51,060
Do you have like.

2975
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:53,160
Can we like split half this order?

2976
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:54,320
Um.

2977
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,200
Because like.

2978
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:55,820
That's a lot.

2979
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:56,360
And you're like.

2980
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:56,920
No.

2981
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,920
You have to order a two person combo.

2982
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,000
I was like.

2983
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:01,860
Oh.

2984
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:04,900
I was just like.

2985
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:05,480
Um.

2986
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:07,020
Do you have any combos for one?

2987
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,000
For Korean barbecue?

2988
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:08,840
And they're like.

2989
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:09,260
Nope.

2990
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:11,620
There's only two person combos here.

2991
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:12,220
And I was like.

2992
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:12,900
OK.

2993
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:21,680
And if I really want to see Kree in 5... WHAT IS THIS?

2994
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:23,340
OH MY GOD!

2995
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:24,820
I PICKED THE WRONG!

2996
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:33,580
Holy shit!

2997
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,220
What is this map?

2998
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:39,320
That's so rough.

2999
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:41,980
That's a rough map right here.

3000
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:47,800
We're ending it on the practice map.

3001
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,120
Fuck it.

3002
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:53,780
Fuck it.

3003
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:57,020
Okay, that's cool.

3004
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:58,780
It actually changes too.

3005
01:56:58,960 --> 01:56:59,700
That's so cool.

3006
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,020
That's pretty cool actually.

3007
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,840
Oh my god.

3008
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,540
Oh my god, the map changes.

3009
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:12,480
Okay, I was gonna say.

3010
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:15,480
That's so fucked up if it's literally just...

3011
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,880
That'd be so fucked up, you know?

3012
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,560
If it's just an open area.

3013
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:22,880
In general.

3014
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:25,440
Okay.

3015
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:27,240
Alright.

3016
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:29,180
Let's see.

3017
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:31,260
Woah!

3018
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,180
I don't even know I'm here.

3019
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:35,660
Yeah.

3020
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:39,060
Nice.

3021
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:47,170
Okay, nice.

3022
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:49,250
Hit.

3023
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:53,920
Alright.

3024
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:55,320
Let's fire.

3025
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:00,220
Let's fire.

3026
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,520
Oh shit!

3027
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,180
The wall!

3028
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:08,960
Holy shit!

3029
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:11,360
I've got walls.

3030
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:14,720
Oh my god.

3031
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:20,370
Oh my god.

3032
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:22,270
I actually got squashed.

3033
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:25,410
Oh my- I was not expecting that.

3034
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,000
Okay.

3035
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,460
Whoa!

3036
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:37,740
The scary part is that like, I'm 1 HP, so like...

3037
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,440
So like, that's scary.

3038
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,840
I'm a little itty bitty spider short and shtop.

3039
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,860
Here is my candle and here is my...

3040
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,360
I like mixed up two nursery rhyme songs.

3041
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:18,140
Oh my god, he died for it.

3042
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:19,700
He died for it, that's fine.

3043
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:21,900
He died for it, for his sins.

3044
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,580
I survived so loud with 1 HP.

3045
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,040
I did.

3046
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:28,620
I was not supposed to be alive.

3047
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:32,560
Wait, what?

3048
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:36,180
Oh, wait, they have a Nurukami too!

3049
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:40,800
Okay.

3050
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,560
Oh, I got you, buddy.

3051
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,020
I got you, baby.

3052
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:47,900
Wait, yeah!

3053
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:49,000
That's right!

3054
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:51,180
We got final kill on you!

3055
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,780
That's goddamn right!

3056
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,340
That's right!

3057
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:06,780
Woo!

3058
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,020
We win that!

3059
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:09,780
Look at that!

3060
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:10,940
I won my last two games!

3061
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:17,140
I don't know if I did anything.

3062
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:17,940
But that's okay.

3063
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:18,700
Nice!

3064
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,320
It doesn't matter!

3065
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:21,520
Nice!

3066
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:23,940
You know what?

3067
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:24,580
You know what?

3068
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:26,840
Well, I like that we ended on that.

3069
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:29,120
Perfect!

3070
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:31,080
Calculated!

3071
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:31,760
That's right!

3072
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:34,000
I purposely did not do more or less.

3073
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:36,140
So we can end on a good number.

3074
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:37,560
Nice!

3075
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:38,440
Nice!

3076
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:38,580
Yes!

3077
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:42,880
Anyways.

3078
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,860
I'm gonna call it here.

3079
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:47,680
Because we do have another Mecha Break stream.

3080
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:51,200
The last one for Twitch Drops on Tuesday.

3081
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:55,380
So if you still haven't got your Twitch Drops yet, for those who don't know, we're new here.

3082
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:58,440

3083
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:05,160
So if you haven't got it yet, I will still be streaming Mecha Break on Tuesday.

3084
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,860

A lot of new items that launch too.

So if you want some items right now to be shipped like now, you can buy them there on the store.

3109
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:15,240
But thank you everybody!

3110
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:20,040
Um, okay, for those who are wondering from pre-order windows, I forgot to ask the staff about that.

3111
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:22,520
But I will ask them like, uh, after the stream.

3112
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:23,760
Anyway, guys.

3113
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:25,860

Posture check.

Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.
