00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,090
Hello, good morning.

2
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,590
I'm tired.

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Good boy.

4
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,980
That's why I took a power nap.

5
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,700
It was a bad... Never take power naps, guys.

6
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,320
Never take power naps.

7
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,760
I fucked up.

8
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,660
I'm so tired.

9
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm so tired.

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,060
I'm so tired.

11
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,680
You know, guys.

12
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,340
Oh my god.

13
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,600
Guys, okay.

14
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,640
I was like, okay, I had to get coffee or take a nap.

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
And I was like, no, I shouldn't.

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
I shouldn't depend on caffeine to stay awake.

17
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,140
Naps are always a cat scam.

18
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,580
I 100% agree with you, Nixie.

19
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,940
They are a scam.

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,720
They are illegal.

21
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,880
They shouldn't be a thing.

22
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,860
Anyway, I was like, okay, I had to take a...

23
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,080
Can I get a super chat?

24
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,980
Thank you.

25
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,080
Okay, I was like, okay.

26
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,300
Also, by the way, I just found out recently that like...

27
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,020
Okay, wait.

28
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,760
Let me look this up.

29
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,860
Let me look this up real quick.

30
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,880
I don't know if they were gaslighting.

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:22,320
Okay, so I recently found out that Frappuccinos is caffeine.

32
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,660
I recently found out about that because I was like, no, I don't like any.

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,260
I don't want to try to depend on caffeine, but I do like Frappuccinos.

34
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:44,180
And then one of my friends was like, you do know Frappuccino has caffeine in it?

35
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,720
I was like, what?

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,380
I thought it was just blended ice with like the flavors.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,440
I thought it was just blended ice.

38
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,860
And then my friend was like, no, the base is caffeine.

39
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,860
And so I was like, why did my parents order me Frappuccino as a child?

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,080
I was like, wait, I drank Frappuccinos as a child.

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:32,870
I was like, I thought they were just giving me sugar drinks.

42
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,860
I thought it was just sugar.

43
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,410
So I was like, oh my God.

44
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,360
You beat me up with drinking caffeine since I was a kid.

45
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,900
My dad would order his Frappuccino and then he would give me a Frappuccino.

46
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,640
So then I'd be like, yippee, cream!

47
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,880
And like, yay!

48
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,220
Yippee, it's sugar drinks with no caffeine in it.

49
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,520
Because Frappuccino is just ice.

50
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:26,000
It's just blended ice with sugar and whatever flavor you decide to put on.

51
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,020
And yeah, no, my mom and dad was ordering Frappuccinos growing up.

52
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,160
And as I get older, I was like, no more Frappuccinos for me.

53
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm a big girl now.

54
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,600
So big girls drink lattes.

55
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:48,600
And then after that, I'm like, sometimes I want to be a little girl and drink a Frappuccino that has no caffeine in it.

56
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,460
Because it's just blended ice and sugar.

57
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,900
It's so relatable.

58
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,520
Oh my god.

59
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,040
I like, that blew my mind.

60
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,420
That actually blew my mind.

61
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,040
I was like, so I'm like this?

62
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,600
I was just like, wait.

63
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,280
Okay, you're not supposed to give your child caffeine at a young age.

64
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,440
But...

65
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,340
You're not supposed to.

66
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:39,740
But clearly, this is what happens when your child has been growing up with caffeine, apparently, since she was young.

67
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,280
And I didn't even know.

68
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,900
I didn't even know.

69
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,060
So I've been hooked on caffeine since I was a child.

70
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,420
I can't believe it.

71
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,560
But I haven't been drinking a lot of caffeine.

72
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,320
I don't drink a lot of caffeine, though.

73
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,520
As I got older, I drank less.

74
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,220
No, that's a lie.

75
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,380
When I got out of university, I started to drink less and less caffeine.

76
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,280
That seems a little better.

77
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,020
My caffeine consumption did get lower when I got out of university.

78
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,340
No name!

79
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,260
Thank you for the super chat.

80
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,620
Thank you.

81
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,120
Thank you.

82
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,740
Naps are not a scam if you go this strap.

83
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,700
Thank you for the super chat.

84
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,040
Thank you.

85
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,580
Thank you.

86
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:35,920
Many.

87
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,980
Thank you for the super chat.

88
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,340
Thank you.

89
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,680
Thank you.

90
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,200
No, I am average height for a tomato.

91
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,020
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

92
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,360
Thank you.

93
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,920
Thank you.

94
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,160
Many.

95
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,440
Inkslicer, thank you for the super chat.

96
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,020
Thank you.

97
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,620
Thank you explains why you're so amped half the time.

98
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,780
Thank you for the super chat.

99
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,160
Thank you.

100
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,920
Thank you Uh Mori, thank you for the super chat and then and I found out later on.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,980
I swapped the green tea like the um What was it?

102
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,420
Green bottle uh Ito, ito something bottle green.

103
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,480
How is it called?

104
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,380
Uh ito yen.

105
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:23,000
I swapped the ito yen And then and I found out from you guys that that also had caffeine in it So i've been fucked i've been like actually fucked up for majority of my life.

106
00:08:23,020 --> 00:09:06,820
Uh And then I found out that also had caffeine I've been non-stop drinking that and I found out from you guys that that also had caffeine in it And then I was like, oh fuck And so after that I went back to water Just water and I think maybe that's why i'm tired all the time I think I honestly think my body has been so used to like Caffeine for a majority of my fucking life apparently That's why sometimes I get really really tired So,

107
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm fucking fine, and then my friend was like, are you fucking stupid?

108
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,740
Like, why would you think Frappuccinos had no caffeine in it?

109
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,840
I was like, because my parents kept ordering it for me!

110
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
Like, I thought when I was a child!

111
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,380
I don't know!

112
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,840
I just thought that, like, you wouldn't give your child caffeine!

113
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,680
I don't know!

114
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:41,780
So I just kept, and I see them make it, and then I see them make the Frappuccino, and like, you know, I just see them put ice!

115
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,560
And then I was like, wow!

116
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,080
It's just made of blended ice!

117
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,140
I thought that was just a drink for the children!

118
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,400
I thought they put that there for the kids!

119
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:02,620
And then I see them, you know, scoop the ice up, and then like, so I was like, that's what it's made out of!

120
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,380
Ice!

121
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,380
And sugar!

122
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,640
And...

123
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,760
I didn't realize that they put caffeine as a base!

124
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,780
No, I thought Frappuccinos...

125
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:26,740
I know, now that I say it, you guys are like, Doki, Frappuccino rhymes with cappuccino.

126
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,540
But I thought it was just cappuccino for kids!

127
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,780
That's where the kappa is gone!

128
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,240
Cause coffee starts with a C.

129
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,820
Cause coffee starts with a C, so that's where the kappa is from.

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,320
So they remove the kappa part, the caffeine part, and then they make the Frapp part.

131
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,060
So like, the Frappuccino stands for freedom.

132
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,660
I don't fucking know.

133
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,160
I just thought, because the kappa part is removed, that means there's no caffeine in it.

134
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,860
Cause that's where the Frapp means.

135
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,060
I don't fucking know.

136
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,760
It just never dawned to me that it has caffeine in it.

137
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,360
I just thought it just had a lot of sugar.

138
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,340
Mori, thank you for the super chat.

139
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,480
Thank you, thank you.

140
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,260
This is why Doki laughs like that.

141
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,300
It all makes sense now.

142
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,180
Thank you for the super chat.

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,700
Thank you.

144
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah, it just means frozen.

145
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,700
Frozen ice.

146
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,120
Chino.

147
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,960
That's what Frappuccino said for me.

148
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,540
Frozen ice and then Chino.

149
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,360
I don't fucking know what the Chino is.

150
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,520
I don't know what the Chino is.

151
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,860
But it just made sense.

152
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Thank you for the super chat.

153
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:51,980
Thank you.

154
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,140
Thank you, Rykro.

155
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,780
Rykro, thank you for the super chat.

156
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,020
Thank you.

157
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,180
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

158
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,920
Thank you, thank you.

159
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,060
It makes you feel better.

160
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,160
I had the same experience.

161
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,780
I never realized McDonald's frappes had...

162
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,380
Exactly!

163
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,380
Why the fuck would they make something that tastes so good and not be for kids?

164
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,200
Thank you for the super chat.

165
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,140
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,680
And it tastes so good.

167
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,300
Why is it not made...

168
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,340
Why is it not made for children?

169
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,220
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

170
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,200
Thank you, thank you.

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't tell me.

172
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,400
Thank you for the super chat.

173
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
Thank you, thank you.

174
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,580
Alright, guys.

175
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,020
Today, we're gonna be playing...

176
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,120
It might be a short stream because it's just a demo.

177
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,920
But if you ever...

178
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,040
Oh, by the way, I just found out that...

179
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,520
Friday Night Funkin' is actually releasing...

180
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,120
I think like this week, is it?

181
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,600
Friday...

182
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,860
The official release for it.

183
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,960
I just realized that.

184
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,900
The official release for Friday Night Funkin' is apparently...

185
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,600
Releasing...

186
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,480
Oh, not this month.

187
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,860
It's apparently releasing...

188
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,560
This month.

189
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,600
Is it a full game?

190
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,940
Or like the next update?

191
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,240
Oh, not full release.

192
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
Just a pit stop.

193
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,700
Oh, okay.

194
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,440
So never mind.

195
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,820
I pledged for this game.

196
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,420
I've been in the Kickstarter for this game for a while now.

197
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,780
So I don't even know what the next update...

198
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,600
So apparently, the next update will be...

199
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,420
This month.

200
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,060
I mean, that's something, you know?

201
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,220
Update of the mini-update.

202
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,640
Oh, it's just a mini-update.

203
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,660
Okay, never mind.

204
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,780
The next update is...

205
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,900
Destination update.

206
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,340
Okay.

207
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,660
So there's a lot of updates that they still have to do.

208
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,920
But hey, oh, the figures are coming out.

209
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,440
I don't even remember what I pledged for.

210
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,920
It's been so long that I don't even know what I pledged for.

211
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,500
It's...

212
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,120
So like...

213
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,440
So I have no idea where we're at anymore.

214
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,660
Anyway, so...

215
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,560
So...

216
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,200
A couple of dragoons made a mod.

217
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,100
A fan mod.

218
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,020
Of Friday Night Funkin'.

219
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,400
That's streamed around me and you guys.

220
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
So I'm excited to check it out.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,700
It's called Tomato Funkin'.

222
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,280
Apparently it's just a demo.

223
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,060
But I still wanted to check it out.

224
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,200
Just because I love checking out the stuff you guys made.

225
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:30,960
And everything.

226
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,300
And...

227
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,240
And it's going to be pretty exciting.

228
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm not too...

229
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,700
Some of you guys are like, oh yeah, the updates...

230
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,100
Updates take so long for it to come out.

231
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,000
And like...

232
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,380
I need you guys to remember it.

233
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,500
I know it's hard to fucking take Kickstarter seriously.

234
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,960
Especially for games and stuff.

235
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,020
But like...

236
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,220
I do trust in the Funkin' crew.

237
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,920
I don't fucking know who the creator was.

238
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,180
I do trust them.

239
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,800
Because they are still at least posting updates and stuff.

240
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,140
It's just...

241
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,880
Games do take a really fucking long ass time.

242
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,840
And I need you guys to remember...

243
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,960
Okay, if you guys don't remember...

244
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,980
Omari was a Kickstarter game.

245
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,840
And the thing is...

246
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,640
Before Omari came out...

247
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,500
There were tons of callout posts about the creator.

248
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,780
For like...

249
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,880
They were saying that...

250
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,760
They were never going to deliver the game.

251
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,140
I remember back then...

252
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,860
When...

253
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,040
Omari...

254
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,060
Before it actually came out...

255
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,600
And became a fucking...

256
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,080
Was it a bestseller or whatever the fuck?

257
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,180
I never played that game by the way.

258
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,700
Because it's not my cup of tea.

259
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm not like...

260
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,080
I cannot play JRPGs.

261
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,960
I know it's not technically a JRPG.

262
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,700
But like...

263
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,780
It's geared towards...

264
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,260
It's the style of the game.

265
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,900
Omari?

266
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,060
I don't know how to pronounce it.

267
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,800
I never played it.

268
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,680
But like...

269
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,480
People were so fucking mad.

270
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
People were...

271
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,680
Incredibly mad.

272
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,020
About the game.

273
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,100
And the creator.

274
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,500
Because it took like...

275
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,260
How many years for it to come out?

276
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,720
People thought she was scamming them.

277
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,780
Because it never came...

278
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,620
It took so long...

279
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,120
For it to come out.

280
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,200
I remember there was like...

281
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Twitlongers, callout tweets, callout posts.

282
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,520
And people were like...

283
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,460
She was refunding people and everything.

284
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,080
And then when the game came out...

285
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
It's like everyone forgot.

286
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,400
Sorry about fucking calling you out.

287
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,040
And thinking you're a scammer.

288
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,020
Great game!

289
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,800
Yeah.

290
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,220
There was so much drama.

291
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,060
I remember on Twitter.

292
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,500
There was like so much fucking drama.

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,240
About it.

294
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,960
Yeah.

295
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,100
And then the game came out.

296
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,380
And then nobody said anything after that.

297
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,400
So like...

298
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,920
I feel like...

299
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,200
I feel like...

300
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,760
That's why...

301
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Like right now, I don't think...

302
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,090
Friday Night Funkin' is...

303
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,790
Scamming anybody.

304
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,150
Even though it does take...

305
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,650
It is taking a long time for the game to come out.

306
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,830
But...

307
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,330
But like...

308
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,550
To be fair...

309
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,330
Omori did take like 7 years.

310
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,870
So...

311
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,350
If it hits 7 years...

312
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,150
Then...

313
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,030
If it hits 8 years...

314
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,970
Then it might be pretty bad.

315
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,470
And then there were people who backed what was that game.

316
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,010
Mighty No.

317
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,070
9?

318
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,110
Oh, those guys definitely got scammed.

319
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,130
Yeah, that's definitely...

320
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,930
I want to play Mighty No.

321
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,430
9.

322
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,070
I forgot I had that on.

323
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,450
Actually, can I still buy Mighty No.

324
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:49,750
9?

325
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,750
I can still...

326
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,810
Oh my god!

327
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,550
Guys, next week I'm going to play Mighty No.

328
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,070
9.

329
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,050
Guys...

330
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,110
Is it...

331
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,710
Why is it not on Steam?

332
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,010
Oh wait, Steam sell ended.

333
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,950
Fuck, okay.

334
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,450
I should have bought it during the Steam sell.

335
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,210
I'm going to play Mighty No.

336
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,510
9 next week, guys.

337
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,910
I've played so many good Mega Man games.

338
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,090
It's time for me to play...

339
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,830
Mighty No.

340
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,390
9.

341
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,090
I don't...

342
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,390
For those who don't know Mighty No.

343
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,230
9, it was a kick-started game by...

344
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,230
Was it like the creators of Mega Man?

345
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,010
And all the team, people that used to work for Mega Man.

346
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,410
And they're like, we're going to make our own spiritual successor to Mega Man.

347
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,210
And it's going to be better than everything you've ever imagined.

348
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,390
And then they got like, how much money?

349
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,370
Okay, Mighty No.

350
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,690
9 kick-started.

351
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,530
And then they got...

352
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,890
$3,845,000.

353
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,170
Plus investors, too.

354
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,630
Plus investors.

355
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,250
Oh, the producers.

356
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,210
Okay, from the producers.

357
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,430
It's always like...

358
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,820
Okay, it's always sketchy when...

359
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:34,130
You know, all these big-name people out there couldn't get investors to invest in their game.

360
00:19:34,570 --> 00:20:01,990
I always feel that's incredibly... Because if you're like really well-known producer slash producer or like creator out there, and you want to make like, you know, slash a spiritual successor or whatever, and you don't have like investors that want to invest in your game even though you have a big name for yourself in the community,

361
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,770
then like I feel like...

362
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,030
I feel like it's a little bit of a red flag to me.

363
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,550
Even Kojima couldn't get investors until...

364
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,710
Yeah, but he still got PlayStation in the end.

365
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,310
He still got PlayStation.

366
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,590
And also because like...

367
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,710
It's like hard.

368
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,510
It is pretty...

369
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,490
If you have a bad, like, you know...

370
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,490
I mean, Kojima got fired, so like a lot of companies were like...

371
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,710
They didn't want to touch him for a bit because they're like, oh shit.

372
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,770
So I relate.

373
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,690
Kojima...

374
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,750
Hikari, thank you for the super chat.

375
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,230
Thank you, thank you.

376
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,090
It did take time, and then he got the investor.

377
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:01,410
Anyway, good to know on my birthday that Doki is a fellow coffee addict.

378
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,350
It was a non-consensual coffee addict.

379
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,210
I didn't even realize.

380
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,570
I was drinking caffeine the entire time.

381
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,270
Also, happy birthday, Hikari.

382
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,090
Happy birthday.

383
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,550
Thank you for the super chat.

384
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,370
Thank you, thank you.

385
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,230
Happy birthday to you.

386
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,210
Happy birthday to you.

387
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,170
Happy birthday, dear Hikari.

388
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,290
Happy birthday to you.

389
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:23,950
Yeah!

390
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
Happy birthday!

391
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:42,950
There is a game that I did want to check out from the Kickstarter that was from a couple of JP devs, but I did get a little worried because it was supposed to be a spiritual successor to a music game, but I don't remember what it was called.

392
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,610
But the music was so...

393
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,550
The music was like...

394
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,390
It's like you use music and beats to control the game, or whatever.

395
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,210
Is it Ratatat?

396
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Ratatat.

397
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:11,350
That looked really interesting, but I also got a little worried because, like I said, if they can't get actual investors to help out with the game, and they rely on Kickstarter, I get worried about that.

398
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,470
Like...

399
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,450
Yeah.

400
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:21,250
Yeah, so like, that worries me a lot, but it looks really good.

401
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,750
I love the music though.

402
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,950
The music sounds really, really good.

403
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,830
The visuals are really nice.

404
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,250
So...

405
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,030
Yeah, so I hope it's not another Mighty No.

406
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,530
9 situation.

407
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:49,970
I don't think I've seen a lot of games from JP developers that started in Japan that have blown up really well.

408
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,930
So that's why...

409
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,610
This is the one that I'm really looking forward to.

410
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,670
I feel like...

411
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,330
Yeah, it's such a wild card.

412
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:14,490
I'm just trying to think of a game that's from a JP dev that's done really well from Kickstarter, but I can't at the moment.

413
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:22,790
I know a lot of indie devs that made games from Kickstarter that did really well, but I can't think of one from JP devs.

414
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,070
Was it Bloodstained?

415
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,650
Bloodstained.

416
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,910
I don't know what Bloodstained is.

417
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,170
I know... What was it called?

418
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,450
Skullgirls tried to Kickstart another game, but it didn't do so well.

419
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,430
I don't remember what it was even called.

420
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,790
I've never heard of this one.

421
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,210
What the fuck is Bloodstained?

422
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,690
Is it supposed to be a Castlevania spiritual successor?

423
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,730
Oh, it's like Castlevania?

424
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,990
Did it do well?

425
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,970
Oh, it has 27,000?

426
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,270
I never heard of this one.

427
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,570
To be fair, I'm not a Castlevania player.

428
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,850
I never grew up with Castlevania.

429
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,010
I'm so sad that the new Castlevania anime...

430
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,970
The new Castlevania show on Netflix is so fucking bad.

431
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,130
That's so weird.

432
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,580
Yeah, I saw season two, the newest season of the...

433
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,960
There's a newest season, the newest spinoff.

434
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,080
The newest spinoff of the uh...

435
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,360
of the Castlevania show, and I didn't even watch the newest season.

436
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,960
I watched the first season of the new spinoff and it was alright.

437
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,120
And then the second I didn't even watch, but it wasn't great.

438
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,900
Like, it was alright.

439
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Like, I was not like a big... I don't know.

440
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,340
I didn't really enjoy it that much.

441
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,300
And then I tried to watch season...

442
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,880
I tried to watch season two...

443
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,640
I tried to watch the first episode of season two, but I just wasn't feeling it.

444
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,020
I wasn't feeling the plot or the animation or story whatsoever, so I never finished it.

445
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,140
Which sucks, because I really liked the first series of the show.

446
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,320
Until like... I liked the first series of the show.

447
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,080
The only weirdest part was when... What's his name?

448
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,160
Was it Alucard?

449
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,900
Yeah, it was when Alucard got in a fucking threesome.

450
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,260
Like, out of nowhere.

451
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,240
And then murdered them.

452
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,000
Because they were trying to...

453
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,440
Like, that was...

454
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,850
That was...

455
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,510
Yeah, that was a little weird.

456
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,770
I thought that was out of nowhere.

457
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,110
When he got...

458
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,850
When he got into a fucking...

459
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,270
Oh, he did what?

460
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,290
Okay, so...

461
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,070
It's not really spoilers, because it doesn't really advance the plot whatsoever.

462
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,190
I'll have to say, it does not actually advance the plot whatsoever.

463
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,890
So, to just...

464
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,430
I don't know.

465
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,330
That part was so...

466
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,130
It just felt like...

467
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,790
It was just fanservice.

468
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:08,110
It felt like a filler fanservice thing, where he just suddenly decides he's like, let me fuck both of them, I guess.

469
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,510
And then they try to murder him, and then he's like, oh, fuck, okay.

470
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,750
Guess I'll kill them.

471
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,490
You ain't a vampire.

472
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,130
You wouldn't get it.

473
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,850
Yeah, so...

474
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,090
Yeah.

475
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,810
It just fell out of nowhere.

476
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,130
That's really it.

477
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,510
I just feel like... Also, yes, I did download the newest update, so don't worry.

478
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:41,730
I saw that you guys did the newest update, so I did see that, so don't worry.

479
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,070
I did download it, so no worries, guys.

480
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,210
Also, I was testing out the game, and I realized that...

481
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:58,250
When I was testing out the game, to make sure everything works, I'm really bad at... I keep forgetting that I'm incredibly terrible at rhythm games.

482
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,210
Every time...

483
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,510
Whoa!

484
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,070
That's me!

485
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,910
Every time I...

486
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:16,730
Every time I go and play rhythm games again, I am reminded of how fucking terrible I am at rhythm games.

487
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,510
Alright.

488
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,510
So, it's gonna take...

489
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:29,850
It's supposed to be a fast, fast, like, short game, but it could be really, really long, depending on if I can complete it or not.

490
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,550
So, yeah!

491
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,030
Huge shout-out to the devs for...

492
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,850
for making a fan mod for me.

493
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,350
It looks amazing so far as a demo, too.

494
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,850
Whoa, buy my merch.

495
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,590
Alright, so let's check out the credits, see who made it.

496
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,330
Alright, so...

497
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,970
Nice cock!

498
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:55,430
A huge shout-out to all the people that, uh, contributed and, um...

499
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,670
Yeah, that's me!

500
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,710
Contributed to this mod.

501
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,250
I am looking forward to, uh, checking...

502
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,470
What the fuck?

503
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,290
I'm looking forward...

504
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,430
I'm looking forward to trying it out, guys.

505
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,930
I feel like I should be smaller for this.

506
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,510
Give me a sec.

507
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,390
Let me be a little smaller.

508
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,410
I wanna be tiny.

509
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,190
I'm gonna be a tiny-mato.

510
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,610
Alright, let me adjust myself real fast.

511
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:22,610
Alright.

512
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,450
There we go.

513
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,910
I wanna be here.

514
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,890
Or do I wanna be here, or do I wanna be here?

515
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,910
Yeah, I wanna be here.

516
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,190
There we go.

517
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,550
I'll be standing here.

518
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,630
Maybe I should get my box.

519
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,790
Where's my box?

520
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,950
Ha ha ha!

521
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,400
I got lazy, so you guys are seeing that.

522
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,460
Oh, there's my box!

523
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,240
There we go.

524
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,020
There we go.

525
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,420
Alright.

526
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,680
Now it feels natural.

527
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,920
I got my box, guys.

528
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,460
Sorry, you're gonna be unimmersed for a little bit.

529
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,680
I say as I try to...

530
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,080
Alright, there we go.

531
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,020
I'm on my box.

532
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,830
Alright.

533
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,930
I feel a little better.

534
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:16,370
Now that I'm on my box and I feel like an adequate height for all of you guys, I'm ready to play the game.

535
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,630
Ha ha ha!

536
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,390
I unimmersed you to be reimbursed.

537
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,450
Alright, there we go.

538
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,710
There we go.

539
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,310
I need my little booster seat, guys.

540
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:26,650
Sorry.

541
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,530
Now I'll actually play the game.

542
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,970
Alright, story mode.

543
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,490
So, I've actually never played the original game, by the way.

544
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,930
All I've done is play the mods.

545
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,430
Ha ha ha!

546
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,670
I've played a ton of the mods, but I've never played the original game.

547
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,570
I've seen the videos of it.

548
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,550
I just never played it myself.

549
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,470
Alright.

550
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,750
Let's go with normal, because I don't trust myself.

551
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,370
I don't trust myself, so I'm gonna go with normal, because I know I'm...

552
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:50,970
Oh, that's you!

553
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,410
Oh, wait.

554
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,310
I'm on the right side.

555
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,750
I forgot I'm boyfriend.

556
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,750
I'm fighting myself.

557
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,430
Why is it so fast?!

558
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,870
Ha ha ha!

559
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,530
Ha ha ha!

560
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,430
Shit!

561
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,690
This is normal!

562
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,890
Oh my God!

563
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,350
Oh my God!

564
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,270
Okay.

565
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,270
Okay.

566
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,590
Um...

567
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,890
Wait, this is normal?!

568
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,030
How is that normal?

569
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,690
Wait, that was a sound, by the way.

570
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,650
How is that normal?!

571
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,550
How the fuck is that normal difficulty?!

572
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,030
Oh my God!

573
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,280
Oh!

574
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,060
Oh!

575
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,920
Oh!

576
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,740
Oh!

577
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,300
How the fuck?!

578
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,580
Let me... Guys!

579
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,960
Guys, I need a...

580
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,180
Guys, give me a sec.

581
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,060
I might need...

582
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,580
It's okay.

583
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,720
You can't see what difficulty...

584
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,940
I'm playing hard right now.

585
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,700
Guys.

586
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,440
Guys.

587
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,740
Guys, I'm on hard.

588
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,100
See?

589
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,940
It's on hard, guys.

590
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,260
It's on hard.

591
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,680
Guys.

592
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,100
Guys, it's on... Guys, it's on hard.

593
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,140
It's on...

594
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,200
Guys, guys, it's on hard.

595
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,080
Guys.

596
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,020
Guys, it's on hard, guys.

597
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,800
I decided I need a bigger challenge.

598
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,860
I decided I need a bigger challenge, guys.

599
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,920
I...

600
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,180
Holy fuck!

601
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,680
Oh my God.

602
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,980
How did it get so easy?

603
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm so good at it now.

604
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,590
Oh my God.

605
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,090
Wait, maybe I am a natural.

606
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,310
Oh my God, I'm a natural.

607
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,990
Oh my...

608
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,910
Look at me go!

609
00:31:59,710 --> 00:31:59,890
Woo!

610
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:06,890
Woo!

611
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,610
Who would've thought maybe a rhythm game is for me on hard?!

612
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,190
Oh

613
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,420
my God.

614
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,260
Oh my God.

615
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,110
Oh my God.

616
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,850
Oh my God.

617
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,930
Oh my God.

618
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,430
Oh my God.

619
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,010
Oh my God.

620
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,890
Guys, it's on...

621
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,390
Guys, I would never lose an easy.

622
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,310
You know that.

623
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,030
You know that.

624
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,390
I would never lose on easy, guys.

625
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,610
But I would absolutely lose at hard.

626
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,030
How do you...

627
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:07,930
How...

628
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,090
How do you...

629
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,170
How?

630
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,330
How did I do this before when I played against Sans?

631
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,660
Wait, where do I use a controller?

632
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,100
Maybe I'm just better on controller, guys.

633
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,080
Okay, nice.

634
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm doing it.

635
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,500
Okay.

636
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,280
Okay.

637
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,620
Okay.

638
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:46,560
Okay.

639
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,790
Oh my God, please.

640
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,290
Oh my God, I'm so lagged in.

641
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,060
Please.

642
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,260
It's not that bad.

643
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,240
Guys, it's not that bad.

644
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,820
I still have a little HP left.

645
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,830
I'm still alive.

646
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,770
I'm still alive.

647
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,130
Don't look at the scum score.

648
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,810
Oh my God, where am I?

649
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,030
Where am I?

650
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,070
I'm alive.

651
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,020
Oh my God.

652
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh my God.

653
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,400
Oh my God.

654
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,520
Oh my God.

655
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,720
Lifeline!

656
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,950
Oh my God, thank God there was a lifeline.

657
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,430
Oh thank God, oh thank God, I lived by it.

658
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,590
Okay, look at that.

659
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,750
I lived!

660
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,390
I lived by the dot!

661
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,040
I'm alive!

662
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,400
Oh my God, I survived!

663
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,160
I survived!

664
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,980
See, guys?

665
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,700
I told you I am on hard difficulty too!

666
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,260
Wow!

667
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,340
Why is it not going to the next level?

668
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, is this one of the bugs?

669
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,200
Look at that.

670
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,040
Guys, look at that.

671
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,400
Guys, why is it not going to the game crash?

672
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:01,480
See, I did so well that my game just crashed, guys.

673
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,260
Look at that.

674
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,320
I did so well.

675
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,680
That's when the game knew that I was gaming, chat.

676
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,420
Does it sound better now?

677
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,300
Alright.

678
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,880
Okay, let's see.

679
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,080
Alright, so I...

680
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,820
How do I...

681
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,680
Wait, but how do I get to the heist part?

682
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,780
Can I free play this?

683
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,740
Wait, I didn't.

684
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,020
Do I have to name it?

685
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,280
Do I have to name my mod?

686
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,720
So it could work?

687
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Wait, is that a thing?

688
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,340
Guys, I didn't know if that's a thing.

689
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,340
Wait, can I just play... I'll just play this.

690
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,360
I think heist is broken.

691
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,140
Because I could never...

692
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,220
I think that part, game mode is broken, right?

693
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,320
Because I feel like I just can't get that part to work.

694
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:07,870
No!

695
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,590
I just think that part's broken.

696
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,990
I did get the newest version.

697
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,790
I did!

698
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,430
Guys, I just...

699
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,650
But it has a second song.

700
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,510
I got the second song working.

701
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,490
Wait, it worked for you?

702
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,230
How did it work for you?

703
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,990
I have the newest version!

704
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,890
It's a...

705
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,490
It's a...

706
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,210
Something...

707
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:38,290
It's the 0.1.1 That's the newest one.

708
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,230
Yeah!

709
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,230
I know I got the newest one because it has the third song.

710
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,370
That's the tomato song.

711
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,270
That's why I know it works.

712
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,990
Because it has...

713
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,790
It has this one.

714
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,610
The tomato tussling.

715
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,570
It has zero difficulty.

716
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,290
My favorite.

717
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,590
Look at that.

718
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,150
There's me.

719
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,850
Oh, wait.

720
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,970
What does that mean?

721
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,650
Am I tofu?

722
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,390
Like, what the fuck is that?

723
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,860
What the hell?

724
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,440
Oh, shit.

725
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,420
I'm still alive, though.

726
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,100
Yeah!

727
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,740
Yeah!

728
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,940
Yeah!

729
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:34,580
Yeah!

730
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I can do this.

731
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,800
I can...

732
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,740
I can do this, guys.

733
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,200
Give me a sec.

734
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,940
Yeah.

735
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,380
Yeah.

736
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,480
It's part of the song.

737
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,440
If you hear a record scratch...

738
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,130
It's part of the song.

739
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,930
You won't understand.

740
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,760
Look at that.

741
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,540
Look at me go.

742
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,160
I'm still alive.

743
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,320
I'm still alive.

744
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,300
I'm living barely on the thread.

745
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Oh, please.

746
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,050
Why?

747
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,590
It's so...

748
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,410
It's so fast.

749
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,610
It's so fucking fast.

750
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,330
Why is it so fast?

751
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,830
Okay.

752
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,150
Guys, it's obviously not zero difficulty.

753
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:40,930
It's a lie.

754
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,250
It's a bug, okay?

755
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,710
It's actually 999 difficulty.

756
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,550
I got this.

757
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,670
It's all about, like, repetition.

758
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,910
It's the only two skulls.

759
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,410
Two skulls.

760
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,830
I'm not looking down yet.

761
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,730
I assume it's still at two.

762
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,780
Oh, my God.

763
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,900
I never got this far before.

764
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,700
I never will.

765
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,740
I never will.

766
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,600
Oh, my God.

767
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,920
And I'll never will, I guess.

768
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,060
Progress, I guess.

769
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,520
It's okay.

770
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,740
I'm figuring it out.

771
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,940
I know why people don't talk when they play rhythm games.

772
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,540
It fucks your rhythm up.

773
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,280
Will I learn my lesson?

774
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:01,800
Nope.

775
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,040
Did I...

776
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,380
Did I use keyboard to find sans?

777
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,220
I don't remember.

778
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,160
It's been so long.

779
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,320
I know it was just as hellish.

780
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,910
Switch to a taskpad.

781
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,790
It's okay.

782
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,390
Whoa.

783
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:57,610
Whoa.

784
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,290
I like how you guys are using my woes for the music.

785
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,750
It's like, no!

786
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,370
Where am I?

787
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,210
What was down scroll?

788
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,110
What the fuck is down scroll?

789
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,540
I don't even remember what down scroll was.

790
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,480
It's been so long.

791
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,940
What does down scroll do?

792
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,440
What does down scroll do, guys?

793
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,780
The secret in playing is not to think about anything.

794
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,680
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

795
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,700
Thank you, thank you.

796
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,380
Oh!

797
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,340
Wee!

798
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,040
Yeah, that makes it easier, right?

799
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,360
Okay, now I can look down.

800
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,700
Okay.

801
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,700
Okay, I can do this.

802
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,500
That's easier, right?

803
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,340
I don't remember it was easier.

804
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,340
I don't remember.

805
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,370
Surely it makes it easier, right?

806
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,850
Oh, my keybinds, too.

807
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,810
It's been so long.

808
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,410
Wait, I think I am better.

809
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,990
I think I'm better with down.

810
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:23,170
I'm so dumb!

811
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,990
I'm so dumb.

812
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:30,950
Guys!

813
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,580
Guys, do you think I play better?

814
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:48,960
Guys!

815
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:49,720
Okay.

816
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,480
Wait, I got it.

817
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,160
Guys, I know what to do.

818
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,860
I know what to do.

819
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,660
Okay, okay, okay.

820
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,120
I figured it out.

821
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,860
I know how to beat the system.

822
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,420
Okay, so...

823
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,460
So...

824
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,500
Oh, I got it!

825
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,700
I figured it out.

826
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,160
I know what to do, guys.

827
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,520
I'll use...

828
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,880
Oh, I know what to do.

829
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,600
I know what to do, guys.

830
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,460
Okay, I figured it out.

831
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,300
I figured it out.

832
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,820
I know what to do.

833
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,600
I'm multi... I'm multi-gaming.

834
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,680
Okay, I already got minus 40.

835
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,580
I was testing it out.

836
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,060
Okay.

837
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,600
Okay, I have W, A, and Up and Down.

838
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Surely this would be easier.

839
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,400
Guys, it was not easier.

840
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,200
Guys, it was not easier.

841
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,700
Guys, it was not easy.

842
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,480
Guys, it was not easy.

843
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,220
Guys, it was not easy.

844
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,500
Oh, you're right!

845
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:57,620
Wait, wait.

846
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,000
Okay, wait, I got it.

847
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,240
Got it, I figured it out.

848
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,940
Oh my god, I did it!

849
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,640
I can fix this!

850
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,930
Oh my god, I'm using two hands!

851
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,050
Two different hands!

852
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:18,990
Two different hands!

853
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:19,490
It works!

854
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,410
I'm multi-drifting!

855
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,500
Where am I?

856
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,800
It's okay, I'm still alive.

857
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,700
Get out!

858
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,360
Wait, this is the most I've been alive for!

859
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,580
It's okay Tomato, keep singing so I have a little more time to live!

860
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,300
Oh my god, I'm doing it!

861
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,060
Multi-drifting!

862
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:16,690
I'm alive!

863
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,090
Yeah!

864
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,530
A.S.

865
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,170
Upright!

866
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,190
I did it!

867
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,590
I'm multi-drifting!

868
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,790
I did it!

869
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,970
I multi-drift, guys!

870
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,270
Look at that!

871
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,650
Beat the score, guys!

872
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:52,550
63,168 with zero misses!

873
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,830
That's right!

874
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,170
Zero...

875
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,690
Wait, give me a sec, give me a sec, guys.

876
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,470
Zero misses, guys!

877
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,930
Oh my god!

878
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,610
Sorry, give me a...

879
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:12,810
Zero!

880
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,250
Okay, there.

881
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:18,190
Look at that!

882
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,230
Zero misses and first try.

883
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,150
That's how you know I'm a gamer.

884
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,170
Ain't no way.

885
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,010
Zero misses, yep.

886
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,210
That's me.

887
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:31,890
Zero misses.

888
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,490
Thank you.

889
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:37,470
Thank you.

890
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,150
It's really hard to be such a gamer, guys.

891
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,850
It really is.

892
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,170
Okay, now let's figure out how to fucking play heist mode.

893
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,350
Oh, my game crashed.

894
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,230
Okay, so apparently I have to rename it?

895
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,790
How do I...

896
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,590
Okay, let me see.

897
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,970
How do I re...

898
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,410
Okay, I gotta rename the mod folder?

899
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,130
Okay, the mod folder is tomato...

900
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:01,690
I can't...

901
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,610
I don't know how to get the heist part working.

902
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,750
How do I fucking...

903
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,330
How do I get the heist part?

904
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:10,630
Game...

905
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,810
I unzip it into the mod folder.

906
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,590
That's literally the one thing I can't get to work.

907
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,270
It's just a heist.

908
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,870
I just need to get the heist part to work.

909
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,230
Yeah!

910
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,270
I downloaded the Google Dra...

911
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,410
Wait, there were more instructions?

912
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:29,330
Wait.

913
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,410
I had to YouTube...

914
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,690
I had to YouTube how to install mods.

915
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,310
For Friday Night Funkin'.

916
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,310
It was not...

917
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,710
Sorry, I need like...

918
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,230
You...

919
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,230
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

920
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,450
It was definitely not doki proof.

921
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:45,430
I...

922
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,290
No, this was not doki proof.

923
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:53,990
I had to watch a YouTube video.

924
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,450
It's in my downloads.

925
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,770
Okay, let's see if I can get heist here.

926
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,130
I renamed the folder to...

927
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,710
Because I actually downloaded...

928
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:08,730
Oh, I got it to work!

929
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,310
I renamed it properly!

930
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,350
Oh my God, that's me!

931
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:19,830
Oh my God!

932
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,250
That's you guys!

933
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,330
So majestic and beautiful.

934
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,730
Oh my God.

935
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,710
Oh my God, it's my like...

936
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,250
Song!

937
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,870
Guys.

938
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,030
Guys, give me a sec.

939
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,030
I did a multi-drift.

940
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,050
Wait.

941
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,130
Wait, restart.

942
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:41,570
Okay.

943
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,870
We're gonna watch this beautiful entry again.

944
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,050
I didn't like...

945
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,870
I didn't set up my multi-drift, guys.

946
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,250
My multi-drift wasn't set up yet.

947
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,910
Oh, I didn't bring the game sound a little bit.

948
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,250
Whoops.

949
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,310
Whoops.

950
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:01,730
Oh.

951
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,230
Okay, give me a sec.

952
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,430
I brought the game sound a little bit.

953
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:06,690
Okay.

954
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:07,970
There you go.

955
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:08,870
Multi-drift set up.

956
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:21,930
Okay.

957
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,150
That's me.

958
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,670
This is seven difficulty?

959
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,990
That's so easy!

960
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,770
This is easier than the tomato one!

961
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,920
Let's go.

962
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,200
That's right, be afraid.

963
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,390
Guys, it's still very easy.

964
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,740
I got this.

965
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,780
I got this.

966
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,340
I got this.

967
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,320
I think I'm hitting some things.

968
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,610
I don't know.

969
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:42,670
Buttons were being hit.

970
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:52,980
Here we go.

971
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
Buttons are still being...

972
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,660
I'm hitting stuff.

973
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,340
Guys, did it look like I was button mashing?

974
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,280
Guys, did it look like I was button mashing?

975
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,340
Because I was definitely not.

976
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,080
Look, I was hitting buttons!

977
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,900
It was being hit.

978
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:27,600
Okay?

979
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,020
Buttons were being hit.

980
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,420
I just didn't say what's the correct buttons or not.

981
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,560
Okay, here we go.

982
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:42,760
Okay.

983
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,680
It'll be fine.

984
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,860
I should press the wrong button.

985
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,120
Okay.

986
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,340
I'll brute force rhythm games if I have to.

987
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,300
I may not be a rhythm game player, but I am.

988
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,360
I'm a very quick learner.

989
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:40,730
Bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum!

990
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:48,590
I just assume if I start bumping, maybe I'll be a better gamer.

991
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,720
Okay, I survived that.

992
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,260
I don't know how I survived that.

993
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:22,430
Oh my god!

994
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:30,330
That fight is out of... out of... how do you do that one?

995
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,330
That fight was freaking crazy!

996
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:40,090
I shall not see me come down yet again, my beautiful self.

997
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,310
I was doing it.

998
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,910
I was.

999
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:53,190
There's not enough time for that dumb part.

1000
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,590
Thank you, superchat, thank you, thank you.

1001
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,110
I'm getting better.

1002
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,730
I'm locking in.

1003
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,430
I'm gonna beat myself up.

1004
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:05,990
Alright.

1005
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,910
Get over here, you're nothing but a tomato.

1006
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:15,190
Okay,

1007
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,260
I'm locked in.

1008
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,700
I'm fully locked in.

1009
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,720
You don't get to see the right arrow key, I realize, but that's okay.

1010
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,880
You don't need to see it.

1011
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,240
God, how do people get like perfect score on this?

1012
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,300
You're not really gonna be challenged, I realize.

1013
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:05,010
It's okay.

1014
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,450
Things are not looking too bad.

1015
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,240
Things are not looking too bad.

1016
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,700
Okay, I'm being saved by the longer arrows.

1017
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,930
Why is it so fast?

1018
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:46,730
Fast!

1019
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,610
I can't process it correctly!

1020
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,130
Oh my God.

1021
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,250
It's okay.

1022
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,310
I'm figuring it out.

1023
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,910
I'm figuring there's so many arrows.

1024
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,950
There's so many fucking arrows.

1025
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,890
It's not that easy.

1026
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,440
Okay, I'm fully locked in.

1027
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,300
I'm kicking my own ass.

1028
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,520
Okay, we're figuring it out.

1029
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,480
We got the long arrows.

1030
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,520
My savior.

1031
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,740
Okay, that's fine.

1032
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,920
I have long arrows.

1033
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:29,930
It's okay.

1034
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,330
This is my savior.

1035
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,190
Before things get rough.

1036
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,620
It's okay, long arrows!

1037
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,960
Saving my day yet again!

1038
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,340
Long arrows, please come save me.

1039
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:19,170
I don't know what to do.

1040
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,690
There's so many.

1041
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,190
There's so many.

1042
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:28,750
How do I get out of my personal hell?

1043
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,810
Oh, it's like Sans all over again.

1044
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:41,430
What the fuck does visualize the beat even mean?

1045
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:42,310
What does that mean?

1046
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,080
This part I'm doing okay.

1047
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,200
Now it's three scuffs instead of 20.

1048
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,860
I don't know.

1049
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,020
Did I use keyboard?

1050
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,780
I don't remember how I did it.

1051
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,000
How did I beat Sans?

1052
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,040
I don't remember what I did.

1053
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,220
I had like the most optimal setup keyboard setup.

1054
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,100
I don't remember what I did.

1055
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,550
Is it long boys?

1056
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:54,470
Save me!

1057
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,420
Save me, long boy!

1058
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,380
Save me, long boy!

1059
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,680
Save me, long boy!

1060
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,600
Okay, guys, I know what to do.

1061
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,820
I know what to do, guys.

1062
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,340
I know what to do.

1063
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,380
I'm gonna cheese it even more.

1064
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,920
Okay, let me watch myself fly in again.

1065
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,940
I know what to do, guys.

1066
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,380
I'm swapping keys.

1067
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,140
I'm swapping keys!

1068
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,900
It's because they were too far.

1069
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,900
The arrow key and the w a were too far, guys.

1070
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,880
I gotta feel it.

1071
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,260
I gotta be born with the rhythm.

1072
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,280
Okay, wait.

1073
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,460
Okay, guys, see?

1074
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,540
It's on normal, guys.

1075
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:22,350
JK, now I know I can do it.

1076
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:31,910
See, guys?

1077
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,840
How would I lose?

1078
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,980
Guys, I swapped my keys around.

1079
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,820
Guys, how would I lose?

1080
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,320
Guys, it took me a while to adjust the key swaps, guys.

1081
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:04,960
That's why.

1082
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,280
It took me a while.

1083
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,200
I forgot I swapped my keys, guys.

1084
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,020
That's what happened.

1085
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,020
Okay.

1086
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:17,420
There we go.

1087
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,340
Save me, long keys.

1088
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,700
Long arrows, save me.

1089
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,750
Okay,

1090
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,270
long keys, save me.

1091
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,520
Oh, God.

1092
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,020
Oh, God.

1093
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,440
There we go.

1094
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:23,740
Wait a minute.

1095
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,420
Okay, guys.

1096
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,940
Guys, I know what to do, guys.

1097
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,200
Guys, no, no, no, no.

1098
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,530
It might be because...

1099
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:56,910
It might... Guys, guys, guys, look.

1100
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:57,910
I figured it out.

1101
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,450
Now I know what's wrong.

1102
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:05,530
Guys, no, no, guys, guys, it's because, guys, I have to do story mode, guys.

1103
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:20,930
Let me, let me, let me do a story mode real quick, guys, because we, let me, we gotta go with options, and then we gotta fix our controls, and then so we can, you know, so we can do, uh, what was it?

1104
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,690
Uh, was it D, F, and J, K?

1105
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:27,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1106
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:39,430
D, uh, D, F, J, oh, J, K.

1107
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,330
There we go.

1108
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:41,430
There we go.

1109
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:49,690
Now, now that I figured it out, guys, now that I figured it out, I'm gonna swap my keyboard to my wooden keyboard.

1110
01:05:49,690 --> 01:06:13,570
Because we're about to start gaming, and I have the fastest, I set it up so it go, it go fast, and then, because now that I have my wooden keyboard, now that I have my wooden keyboard, and it's on hard, hard difficulty, we got this.

1111
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:25,050
Okay, guys, I'm... It's been a while.

1112
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,680
Guys, it's... I'm not used to new controls.

1113
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,060
Here we go, I figured it out.

1114
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:52,860
Oh my God.

1115
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:00,210
Okay, I'm free.

1116
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,430
Okay, I'm doing a lot better though.

1117
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,670
I am doing a lot better, you gotta admit that.

1118
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,350
On, like, hard.

1119
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,390
I didn't mean to say that, I fucking fumbled my notes.

1120
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:23,090
Okay.

1121
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,990
No, it's fine, it's fine, I'm really good at rhythm, guys, I'm getting better.

1122
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:28,390
I'm so good at rhythm.

1123
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:35,200
Look at that!

1124
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,040
Look at that, I'm beating the middle up!

1125
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,080
That's me!

1126
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,910
See?

1127
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:52,050
So easy, a child could do it.

1128
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,370
But not me, I'm not a child.

1129
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,290
That's why it's even easier.

1130
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,130
I think I found it.

1131
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,930
I think I found my sound setup.

1132
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Mic drop.

1133
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,660
There you go, look at that!

1134
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,800
Don't look at the last note, but look at that!

1135
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,480
No, no, no!

1136
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,860
Hard difficulty is hard!

1137
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,400
Guys, hard difficulty is hard!

1138
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,440
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1139
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,440
I never go easy, guys, you know me.

1140
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,380
Me going easy?

1141
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,480
That's crazy talk.

1142
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:56,730
You might need to get your glasses checked.

1143
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:59,950
You just think I'm on easy right now.

1144
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,670
What do you mean?

1145
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,380
Look at that!

1146
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,720
You can tell this is very hard.

1147
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:17,820
Look at how fast I'm going.

1148
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,320
Look at me, I'm on the left side, by the way.

1149
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,670
Can you tell I'm on the left side?

1150
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:28,070
Because that's me?

1151
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,190
I'm fighting against boyfriend.

1152
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:34,510
I steal his woman.

1153
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,020
Wait, this is actually so much easier.

1154
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,260
Why was I playing on this keyboard?

1155
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:55,480
Oh yeah, because I had no arrow keys on it.

1156
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:10,960
Jesus Christ.

1157
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:11,800
That's okay.

1158
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,060
Long arrows!

1159
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,540
My savior!

1160
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:30,590
Okay.

1161
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,940
Oh my god, I got baited.

1162
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,920
Oh my god, I got baited.

1163
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,960
Oh my god, you fucked me!

1164
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,780
That could have killed me!

1165
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:10,250
Guys, don't look.

1166
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,830
Guys.

1167
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,470
Guys, it says...

1168
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:17,330
Extra hard.

1169
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,390
Guys, don't look.

1170
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:20,770
Don't look.

1171
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:22,350
That's what it says.

1172
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:23,410
Wow!

1173
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:26,330
Oh my god!

1174
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,840
Look at that.

1175
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,560
Wow!

1176
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,000
Extra hard!

1177
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,380
Oh my god, I'm such a gamer.

1178
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,100
Yeah, that's right.

1179
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:43,960
That's me.

1180
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,500
That's me.

1181
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,080
Extra hard.

1182
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:47,180
Extra hard.

1183
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:55,720
Sorry, I was actually on a separate difficulty that only I can unlock.

1184
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,000
Oh wait, lasso looter.

1185
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,240
That's an extra one, right?

1186
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,940
Oh god, thank you for the super chat.

1187
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,140
Thank you, thank you.

1188
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,800
That's right.

1189
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,040
Oh wait, what?

1190
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,440
Oh my god.

1191
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,160
Wait, that's me!

1192
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:07,700
Yeehaw!

1193
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:21,630
Yeehaw!

1194
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:21,850
Yeehaw!

1195
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:24,930
That's so cute!

1196
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,750
The background's so fucking cute!

1197
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,750
Look at me go.

1198
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,660
Oh my god, I need to learn a new... I need a few new muscle memories.

1199
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,040
Wait, I'm still... I'm singing with her?

1200
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,000
I'm with me?

1201
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,960
Long arrow, thank you.

1202
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:01,830
Oh my god.

1203
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:07,650
Oh, this...

1204
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,650
It's okay, not that difficult, guys.

1205
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:30,260
Nice.

1206
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:39,800
Yeah!

1207
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,380
First try!

1208
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,860
On extra hard.

1209
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:49,800
Yeah!

1210
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,580
First try!

1211
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,480
Let's go!

1212
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,510
I'm curious, though.

1213
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:06,210
I am...

1214
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:10,430
I am curious on what regular hard difficulty is like.

1215
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:14,030
Maybe it'll be even easier, you know?

1216
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:16,610
On regular hard difficulty.

1217
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,650
I mean, haha.

1218
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:21,230
Let's see how that's like.

1219
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:29,090
Let's see how regular hard is like.

1220
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:33,110
Sorry.

1221
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:33,770
Sorry.

1222
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,130
I...

1223
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,950
I saw those notes.

1224
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,890
I didn't know what to think.

1225
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:42,450
When I saw those notes.

1226
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,550
Where am I?

1227
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:50,450
Did I bug out?

1228
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:53,230
Wait, but I'm still alive, though.

1229
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,530
I think I broke the game.

1230
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:03,210
Like, my mind actually buffered trying to look at it.

1231
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:05,590
The camera...

1232
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:08,550
The camera even was like, the fuck is this?

1233
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,370
Where am I?

1234
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,060
Just get me out.

1235
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,080
Okay, alright.

1236
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,340
But like, what is normal difficulty on?

1237
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,200
Actually, what is normal difficulty on?

1238
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,660
This one was very hard.

1239
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,800
Even on very hard, it was very hard.

1240
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,320
I'm curious.

1241
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,550
There's me.

1242
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:47,230
I'm flying.

1243
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:48,810
Hello, everybody.

1244
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,490
It's me, Doki Bird.

1245
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:51,310
Yippee!

1246
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:53,390
Okay.

1247
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:58,310
Let's see how hard is hard.

1248
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,160
Okay, um...

1249
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,660
It's not that bad.

1250
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,940
Not gonna lie.

1251
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,080
It's not that bad.

1252
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,990
It's not that bad.

1253
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:23,350
It's not that bad.

1254
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,680
Guys.

1255
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,040
It's not that bad.

1256
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,100
I can't.

1257
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,900
I failed.

1258
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,680
I'm dying to be the free.

1259
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:03,140
I'm dying to fly again.

1260
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,440
Guys.

1261
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,100
My tiny tomato brain.

1262
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,780
Might decide to retire.

1263
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,680
But, I mean, we still have...

1264
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,260
Alright, guys.

1265
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:15,760
Look at that.

1266
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:16,720
I'm such a gamer.

1267
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:17,760
I finished.

1268
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,980
Those were fun, though.

1269
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,460
But it's not over yet, guys.

1270
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,980
Since we still...

1271
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,920
I wanna play more mods.

1272
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,360
So let's do another mod.

1273
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,180
Let's add another.

1274
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:27,560
You know what?

1275
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,400
Since I have Friday Night Funkin' out right now.

1276
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,200
Let's check out some other mods, too.

1277
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,520
But, yeah!

1278
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,200
Thank you to the Dragoons!

1279
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,500
Who made this!

1280
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,040
I really appreciate it.

1281
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,520
I can't wait to see the finished version in the future.

1282
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,220
Next time I'm gonna try this out is when the finished version comes out, too.

1283
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,140
So, yeah.

1284
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,720
Huge shoutout to the Dragoons.

1285
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:49,980
For making...

1286
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,520
Tomato Funkin'.

1287
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,980
That was really fun to play.

1288
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,960
Let's see if you Dragoons can do it better.

1289
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,200
On hard difficulty, huh?

1290
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,900
I was on very hard, guys.

1291
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,080
So, I don't know.

1292
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,940
I don't know if you guys can beat what I did.

1293
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:13,050
Huge shoutout to all the people that made this mod.

1294
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,630
I had a great time checking it out.

1295
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,610
Like I said, I've never actually played the main base game.

1296
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,530
But I've already seen.

1297
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,130
But, like, we don't need to play the main base game.

1298
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,110
I think it's more fun.

1299
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:24,110
I think the mods are more fun than the actual main base game.

1300
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,630
And there's like so...

1301
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:26,770
Wait, what the fuck?

1302
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:28,650
There's a Simpsons mod.

1303
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,050
There's like...

1304
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:34,170
I know there's like a ton of really...

1305
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:40,670
There's like a lot of really good versions where they like fucked around with like a ton of different mechanics and stuff.

1306
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:43,530
There was like one I was looking at that seemed really cool.

1307
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:46,070
Oh my god, there's a Miku one.

1308
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:48,050
Wait, they have a Miku mod?

1309
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:48,970
Of course they do.

1310
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:49,350
You know what?

1311
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,030
Of course they have a Miku mod.

1312
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:53,030
It's Friday Night Funkin'.

1313
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:54,470
What?

1314
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:55,430
Oh my god.

1315
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,990
They have a Spongebob mod?

1316
01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:58,250
Oh my...

1317
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:01,930
Wait.

1318
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,930
Wait, I want to see what are mods.

1319
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:05,070
Wait, let's see.

1320
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:07,050
Where am I on?

1321
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:08,510
Okay, Friday Night Funkin'.

1322
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,570
What's the most downloaded?

1323
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:12,870
Of course the tricky one is the most downloaded.

1324
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:14,450
What's the Psych Engine?

1325
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:16,050
What the fuck is that?

1326
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,290
Wait, there's a Doki Doki Literature Club?

1327
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:23,230
Wait, there's Doki Doki Literature Club.

1328
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,950
There's Hypnos Lullaby.

1329
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,330
Why are they all like horror themed?

1330
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,950
Why is there so many horror...

1331
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:29,830
Oh my gosh, wait.

1332
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:30,630
I forgot.

1333
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:33,610
A lot of the people...

1334
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:43,530
Is it really weird for me... Is it fucked up for me to say that a lot of the community here for Friday Night Funkin', like the majority...

1335
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:54,330
It's like Five Nights at Freddy's are like children so like horror themed stuff is like the way to go for the kids.

1336
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:05,730
It's usually like if we want the children fan base you make a horror themed mod.

1337
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:07,190
Children really like...

1338
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:07,910
I don't know why.

1339
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:10,610
I don't know why children really, really like horror.

1340
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,610
I don't understand.

1341
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,590
Friday Night Funkin' mods.

1342
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:25,710
Like it just feels like a lot of kids just really like just really, really like horror mods or horror games in general.

1343
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,570
Let's see.

1344
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,970
I'm gonna check out the Miku.

1345
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:33,030
I wanna do the ones where they have like cool mechanics.

1346
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:38,290
There's like ones where like they add like unique mechanics to the Friday Night Funkin' stuff.

1347
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:39,770
I wonder if I can find one.

1348
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:44,050
I saw like there were people posting like stuff for it too.

1349
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,550
Oh my god, where is it?

1350
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:47,910
What's in this lullaby?

1351
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:50,470
Oh, that shit's scary.

1352
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:51,990
This is not...

1353
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,270
Wait, wait, I know!

1354
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:53,930
Wait!

1355
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:58,410
Wait, I know which one to play!

1356
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,290
Wait!

1357
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,310
Wait, oh my god.

1358
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:04,270
Wait, wait, wait.

1359
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:09,250
I know exactly which one I wanna... I know which one I wanna do.

1360
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,530
Wait, I...

1361
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:15,890
I know which one I wanna play.

1362
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:17,610
I wonder if it's this one.

1363
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:20,710
Okay, wait, no, this is full.

1364
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,790
Wait, old version?

1365
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,390
Oh, this one.

1366
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:24,830
Okay.

1367
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,550
I know exactly which one.

1368
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,690
New.

1369
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:28,830
Okay, I'm downloading.

1370
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:32,190
I'm downloading this one.

1371
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:33,770
I wonder if it works.

1372
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:35,150
Okay.

1373
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,670

01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:38,430

1376
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:41,910
Okay guys, don't worry, guys, give me like...

01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,430
I'm so excited for this one.

1379
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:51,570
Hahahaha Hahahaha You'll see.

1380
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:52,430
You'll see, guys.

1381
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,710
You'll see what it is the moment when I get... You'll see, guys.

1382
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:59,170
Hahahaha It's a good one.

1383
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,150

1384
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:03,270
I swear to god, it's a good one.

1385
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:06,850
Oh my god, there's the Fall Guys version!

1386
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,230
There's Fall Guys, there's...

1387
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,170
Some of them are like... there's like Simpsons.

1388
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,650
There's My Little Pony.

1389
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:20,930
Okay, so there's... oh my... oh, there's my favorite one.

1390
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,310
There's one that I really, really like.

1391
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,850
That's like... that I'm like obsessed with in terms of the song.

1392
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:27,130
Wait, what's the Among Us version?

1393
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,790
Wait, what's the Among Us version?

1394
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:30,070
Okay.

1395
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:31,370
Where's the mods?

1396
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:35,370
I'm like so confused looking at...

1397
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:45,830
I'm so confused looking at like all these versions of Friday Night Funkin'.

1398
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,810
Because there's... I've never been on Gamebanana before.

1399
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:53,450
And there's just so much information that I'm like getting overloaded.

1400
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:58,950
Like, I'm just like... I can't even word because there's so many texts in front of me.

1401
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,370
There's just so many words.

1402
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:03,670
Wait!

1403
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,730
Oh my god, do they... oh, wait.

1404
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:06,450
Okay, I need to see.

1405
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,370
I need to see if they have this one.

1406
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:14,170
Okay, do they have a good version of this game in particular?

1407
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:18,910
No, they don't!

1408
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:19,690
I'm sad.

1409
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:24,270
I was trying to say they have a good Animal Crossing version of Friday Night Funkin'.

1410
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:25,950
So I can like...

1411
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,710
So I can play like K.K.

1412
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:31,650
Slider songs on it.

1413
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,690
I'm pretty scuffed.

1414
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,510
I'm looking at it.

1415
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:37,290
It's pretty scuffed.

1416
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,440
Okay, I'm ready.

1417
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,440
Okay, did I download it?

1418
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,400
Oh my god, it's such a huge file!

1419
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,620
It's such a fucking huge file!

1420
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:48,960
Yeah, that would be cool.

1421
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah, I wanted to see if they had an Animal Crossing version because I want to be K.K.

1422
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,720
Slider.

1423
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:54,900
Okay.

1424
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,340
I'll sing Bubblegum.

1425
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:11,780
There's so many horror.

1426
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,740
I feel like every line is just another horror mod.

1427
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,820
That's just crazy how many horror mods there are.

1428
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:20,740
Load more, please.

1429
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,740
Wait, most liked...

1430
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:26,300
Actually, most viewed should be the one to look at.

1431
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,580
Usually the most viewed would be like the best ones.

1432
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,740
I wish they can have like most viewed and then like...

1433
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,220
Oh wait, it can.

1434
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:35,840
Most viewed...

1435
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,800
Oh, there's not.

1436
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:41,380
Like within like the last month or the last year or something.

1437
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,540
Because usually the newer ones are also like pretty cool too.

1438
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,540
They had like cool...

1439
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,860
There's like the shaggy one.

1440
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,140
Wait.

1441
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,260
Shaggy...

1442
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:50,740
Shaggy Friday.

1443
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,560
That one looked fucking insane.

1444
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:57,000
I remember watching a YouTuber play the shaggy mod.

1445
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,020
They had it.

1446
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,020
Is it shaggy corrupted?

1447
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,940
Is it that one?

1448
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,140
Where he fucking goes crazy?

1449
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,860
Oh yeah, the seven keys.

1450
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,780
Yeah, this...

1451
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,500
I'm not playing.

1452
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,360
Guys, by the way, there's no way I'm playing that version.

1453
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,320
Because he fucking gives you seven keys.

1454
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,500
I'm like...

1455
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,920
Yeah, we are not finishing.

1456
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,080
We are not beating that whatsoever.

1457
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,960
Yeah, that's really...

1458
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,380
Yeah, I remember seeing...

1459
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,620
Oh wait, what's this?

1460
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:33,660
Sustice Snogas.

1461
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,180
The fuck is that?

1462
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,300
Oh my god.

1463
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:39,840
That...

1464
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,100
This one's definitely for kids.

1465
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,840
That was definitely made for kids.

1466
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,060
Iden, thank you for the super chat.

1467
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,160
Thank you, thank you.

1468
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,840
There's a mod called Mario's Madness.

1469
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,060
It's a surprising good mod.

1470
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,980
Has a lot of content and mechanics.

1471
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:02,180
It's also one of few mods that's not cancelled by the devs.

1472
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:02,980
What does that mean?

1473
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,100
What do you mean by cancelled by the...

1474
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,740
Oh, you mean like they're still working on it?

1475
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1476
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,400
Thank you for the super chat, Iden.

1477
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,460
Thank you, thank you.

1478
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:12,560
Wait, what's this?

1479
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,440
Mario's Madness.

1480
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,060
Never heard of it.

1481
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,360
Wait, is there Mario's Madness?

1482
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,000
Mario's Madness Version 2 but ported in 6K.

1483
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:22,460
What?

1484
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,220
Where is just...

1485
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:30,860
There's like Mario's Madness Version 2 but ported in 6K.

1486
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,120
The fuck does that mean?

1487
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,900
Is it not just the original?

1488
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,260
Oh, Madness Origins?

1489
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,100
Oh wait, what the fuck does that mean?

1490
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,880
Why is there so many information?

1491
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,080
What about Mario's Madness?

1492
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,160
Oh, did it finish downloading?

1493
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:51,460
Yeah!

1494
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,220
Okay.

1495
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,460
How do I do this?

1496
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,780
Oh wait, it's its own execution too!

1497
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,680
Okay, nice.

1498
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,420
Extract.

1499
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,200
I need you to extract yourself now.

1500
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,540
Extract all.

1501
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:12,880
Okay.

1502
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,100
Nice.

1503
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,040
It's its own EX file.

1504
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:19,660
Okay.

1505
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,080
Let's see if this works.

1506
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,900
I hope I don't get a virus.

1507
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,680
Let's see.

1508
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,180
Oh my God!

1509
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,120
That's so fucking funny!

1510
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,500
It's its own, like, little...

1511
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,220
Select song.

1512
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,560
Freeplay unlocked.

1513
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,920
But what if I don't want to freeplay?

1514
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,680
How do I play it?

1515
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,280
Wait, no, I don't want to join the Discord.

1516
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,680
How do I play your song?

1517
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:18,260
Do I activate it?

1518
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:23,990
Oh my God, that's...

1519
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:26,650
Wait.

1520
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:28,310
What?

1521
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:30,170
You can use power-ups?

1522
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,390
What the fuck?

1523
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,660
Wait.

1524
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,160
I need to fix my opti...

1525
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:51,980
Give me a sec.

1526
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:53,840
Okay.

1527
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:57,040
Okay, give me a sec.

1528
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,040
I realized I never...

1529
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,120
I didn't fix anything.

1530
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,100
I...

1531
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,280
I didn't fix anything.

1532
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,960
I got really confused, guys.

1533
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,440
I got very confused.

1534
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:12,970
Okay.

1535
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:16,570
There we go.

1536
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:17,570
There we go.

1537
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:19,350
Okay, things should be better now.

1538
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,990
Wait, they don't have the down.

1539
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:23,630
Wait, visuals.

1540
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:25,390
Wait.

1541
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:28,190
Wait, they don't have scroll down.

1542
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,610
Down scroll, there we go.

1543
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:30,330
There we go.

1544
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,750
Okay, okay.

1545
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,410
I'm okay now.

1546
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,210
Guys, everyone...

1547
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:39,430
I'm okay now, guys.

1548
01:29:40,510 --> 01:29:41,550
Guys, fuck.

1549
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:43,070
It keeps trying to make me join their Discord.

1550
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:45,330
How do I play the game?

1551
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,920
How do I play your game?

1552
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:54,580
Stop!

1553
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,280
I'm trying to want to join your Discord server!

1554
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:01,900
Stop!

1555
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,020
It keeps...

1556
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:06,600
It keeps accidentally clicking the server.

1557
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:10,960
Please!

1558
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:11,980
I'm telling you!

1559
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:14,380
Okay.

1560
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:15,680
Okay, wait, wait.

1561
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,360
I got this.

1562
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:18,700
Option?

1563
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,480
Wait, no, not option.

1564
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,140
How did I start the song before?

1565
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,500
Oh, activate!

1566
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,500
Oh, it's activate.

1567
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,000
It's the green button.

1568
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,580
It's the tiny ass green button.

1569
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,840
Okay, I figured this out.

1570
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:33,980
Alright, TF2A.

1571
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,940
Bandicam is temporary.

1572
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,500
Okay, I got this.

1573
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,200
I'm a better scout.

1574
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:49,530
I'm a little worried that I couldn't select difficulty.

1575
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,900
Long arrows save the day.

1576
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,300
Okay, my HP is still okay, guys.

1577
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,800
I need that long arrow.

1578
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:18,980
Save me.

1579
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,950
Wait, wait, what?

1580
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,550
No!

1581
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:58,010
Oh my god!

1582
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:59,150
What the fuck happened?

1583
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:02,230
What did he do to me?

1584
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:06,490
What do I do?

1585
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:17,930
Holy shit.

1586
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:20,190
Am I supposed to hit the drink?

1587
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,250
I couldn't tell.

1588
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:30,810
Oh no, don't hit the drink.

1589
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:33,830
I was dodging them at first.

1590
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:35,110
Because I couldn't tell.

1591
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:38,890
Okay, don't hit it.

1592
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:43,010
Oh my god, this is...

1593
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,050
This is my training arc right here.

1594
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,670
My ma trained me for this.

1595
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:15,850
Oh my god!

1596
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:17,670
Fuck you!

1597
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:22,590
He's so good!

1598
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:25,870
I'm trying so hard!

1599
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:31,310
This act, there's no difficulty setting too!

1600
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:33,830
That's the worst part!

1601
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,170
That's the best part.

1602
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,850
Oh my god, it's like Sans all over again.

1603
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:19,290
No!

1604
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:27,030
No, it's just like part!

1605
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:37,630
Oh my god!

1606
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:40,670
It's like Sans all over again!

1607
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:43,070
It's just like Sans!

1608
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:43,930
Please!

1609
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:52,810
Okay.

1610
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:54,570
It's fine.

1611
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:01,270
I'm getting better though.

1612
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:02,350
I think.

1613
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:39,620
No!

1614
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,200
I drank the thing!

1615
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,700
I drank the thing!

1616
01:35:52,290 --> 01:35:54,310
No, I drank the thing!

1617
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:56,550
I drank the drink!

1618
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:58,410
I drank the...

1619
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:01,310
Please, Scout, stop!

1620
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:02,510
Stop!

1621
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:10,030
I drank the thing.

1622
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:10,930
Couldn't help it.

1623
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:11,570
It was yellow.

1624
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,800
Yellow is good, right?

1625
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:30,180
I see yellow drinking.

1626
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:30,840
Drink it.

1627
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,820
Can't help it.

1628
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:34,600
Oh my

1629
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:45,530
god.

1630
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:07,880
No, I...

1631
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,480
Please, stop!

1632
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,600
I keep accidentally clicking it.

1633
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:15,920
I keep drinking it.

1634
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,420
Stop!

1635
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:24,700
No, dude, I can't stop myself!

1636
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:30,040
Oh, French Vulture is doing things to me, chat.

1637
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,900
That's why he's trying to steal my girlfriend.

1638
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,320
He's finally cosplaying for me.

1639
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,220
I'm locking in.

1640
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:19,180
No!

1641
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,720
I keep clicking on it!

1642
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,440
I keep clicking on it!

1643
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:26,220
It's just...

1644
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,220
It's just there!

1645
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,360
I just wanna drink it so badly!

1646
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:39,740
I can't help it!

1647
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,980
Please, let me get out of here.

1648
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,520
I always get so close.

1649
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,490
I think I'm getting worse.

1650
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,380
And, like, he's supposed to be the easiest cos he's the first one.

1651
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,980
This is... I can't believe it.

1652
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,620
I can't believe it.

1653
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:09,500
This is supposed to be the easiest, too.

1654
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:35,010
Oh, I'm too HP!

1655
01:39:36,130 --> 01:39:37,130
I'm too HP!

1656
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:39,050
I can't!

1657
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:41,270
Oh my god!

1658
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:45,870
Stop hitting it!

1659
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:47,390
Stop hitting it, Doki!

1660
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:48,510
Stop hitting it!

1661
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:50,450
Please, just get out of the first level!

1662
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:51,830
That's all I ask!

1663
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:53,790
Just get out of the first level!

1664
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:56,350
Stop drinking!

1665
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:59,730
This song's gonna be stuck...

1666
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:02,170
It's gonna live right free in my head for the rest of the day.

1667
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,750
I already forgot that I was supposed to go.

1668
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,220
That's okay, I'm getting better at that part.

1669
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,020
Oh,

1670
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,100
without the long lines, I would've been so fucked.

1671
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:51,300
Please have mercy on me!

1672
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,220
Please, Scout!

1673
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:56,920
Please!

1674
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,580
Have mercy on me, Scout!

1675
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,860
I'm sorry, you're dead, Spy!

1676
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,280
I mean, not gonna lie, it's pretty cool.

1677
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:09,720
Oh my god, it's on hard and you can't change it?!

1678
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:20,960
This is Team Fortress 2.

1679
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,360
You can't even change the...

1680
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:27,860
Oh my god.

1681
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,260
TF2 players are like, you go hard or you go home.

1682
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,360
There's no Weenie Hut Jr. for you.

1683
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:46,600
There's no Weenie Hut Jr. for you.

1684
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,400
You're not in Overwatch right now.

1685
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:32,290
Return my HP, please.

1686
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:32,470
Oh my god.

1687
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:20,260
Oh, come on!

1688
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,440
I was doing so well!

1689
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:22,620
I was actually...

1690
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,340
That was my best run!

1691
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,520
That was my best run!

1692
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:30,460
That was my best run that I've done so often!

1693
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,460
I started mouth-breathing so often.

1694
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:36,400
Oh my god.

1695
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:38,740
Why does he do this to me?

1696
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:41,620
It was the best run I've ever had!

1697
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:45,620
Oh my god.

1698
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:51,980
The fact that it only is in hard difficulty is the most messed up part.

1699
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,050
Okay.

1700
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:37,440
HP!

1701
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:38,560
I couldn't!

1702
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,880
It's just too much going on!

1703
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:42,220
My HP was gone!

1704
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,320
That was my locked-in moment.

1705
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,680
The two ones before was my...

1706
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,640
Oh my god.

1707
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,100
That was my moment of shame.

1708
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:54,640
I could never recover.

1709
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:58,820
This song will be honey-tokey in the stream chat.

1710
01:44:59,020 --> 01:44:59,980
Thank you for the stream chat.

1711
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,080
Thank you.

1712
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,340
I'm still getting better, right?

1713
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:10,960
Okay, I don't actually know if I'm getting better.

1714
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:14,800
I think

1715
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:19,860
I am.

1716
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:20,540
Why?

1717
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:43,550
Maybe I'm not hitting a thing.

1718
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:51,390
Oh, I'm 7 HP, guys.

1719
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,330
No!

1720
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,370
I'm 7 HP!

1721
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:56,630
Please!

1722
01:45:57,330 --> 01:45:59,090
Please, let me change it!

1723
01:45:59,190 --> 01:45:59,630
Please!

1724
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,070
Team Fortress 2!

1725
01:46:01,410 --> 01:46:08,110
I wanna go back to Weedion Jr. Let me go to Weedion Jr.

1726
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:17,710
Please let me do Weedion!

1727
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:37,780
Please, Tokyo.

1728
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,240
I'm believing less and less, guys.

1729
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:48,710
Give me my HP back.

1730
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:02,060
No!

1731
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:07,170
Oh my god!

1732
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:08,350
Please!

1733
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:09,770
Please!

1734
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:12,390
There has to be a way!

1735
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:14,130
Please!

1736
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:17,420
Please let me...

1737
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:25,030
I'm so sad.

1738
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:29,910
There is none.

1739
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:32,350
Go big or go home.

1740
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:33,830
Uncle, I'm coming.

1741
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:34,490
Please.

1742
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:38,930
Why is the default difficulty hard?

1743
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:42,090
Okay.

1744
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:45,130
Okay.

1745
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:46,850
I got this.

1746
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:48,850
You're right.

1747
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:00,610
I can't give up now.

1748
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:04,010
I will beat him just like how I beat Sans.

1749
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:11,310
Oh, I'm getting worse, guys.

1750
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:13,670
You guys ain't looking so good for me.

1751
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:14,530
I'm getting worse.

1752
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:19,760
I am not locked in.

1753
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:40,830
No, I hit the thing.

1754
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:41,670
I hit the thing.

1755
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:42,490
I hit the thing.

1756
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:46,070
Guys, I hit the thing.

1757
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:48,150
No!

1758
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:49,650
I hit the thing!

1759
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:50,790
Please.

1760
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:52,650
I'm trying.

1761
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,250
I'm trying so hard.

1762
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:55,070
You don't understand.

1763
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:00,870
You don't understand.

1764
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:07,710
My rhythmless brain was never supposed to put in the deep end of the swimming pool.

1765
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:13,370
It's like chucking a baby out into the ocean and be like, learn to swim.

1766
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:29,130
Please, I'm an FPS gamer.

1767
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:31,710
Not a rhythm gamer.

1768
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,230
Have mercy.

1769
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,920
He's just a tomato.

1770
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,920
Oh my god.

1771
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:09,030
Oh my god.

1772
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:14,370
Please.

1773
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:22,690
I'm trying.

1774
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:25,650
It's always the cans.

1775
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:27,290
It's the cans.

1776
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:30,370
It's the cans, guys.

1777
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:31,730
It's the cans.

1778
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:49,500
Okay.

1779
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:50,980
Okay, Toki.

1780
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:53,500
Can't be that bad.

1781
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,820
Remember when I was so happy to play TF2?

1782
01:50:59,180 --> 01:50:59,900
My...

1783
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:00,600
Those...

1784
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,540
Those were the good old days.

1785
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,700
I wish I never found you.

1786
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:06,320
I...

1787
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:11,180
I was so happy at the beginning of the stream.

1788
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,000
I had actual joy in my heart.

1789
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:17,060
I was like, oh my god, they're scouts.

1790
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:21,080
Look at how much effort they put into this mod.

1791
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:30,920
There was so much joy.

1792
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:31,080
Okay.

1793
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:36,740
I thought...

1794
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:40,120
I thought there would be difficulty settings.

1795
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,910
There's no difficulty settings.

1796
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:52,610
It's just straight into it.

1797
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:25,840
Don't finish me.

1798
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:38,130
Please, scout.

1799
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:41,230
Just a tomato.

1800
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:48,820
Let me sing, let me sing!

1801
01:54:09,170 --> 01:54:11,670
Why won't you let me sing?!

1802
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:20,150
He just let me slowly die!

1803
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:32,960
Beauty can often be a mask to evil, but I think even the super chat thinks this mod would be a pretty good example for what we've seen.

1804
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:50,280
Oh my god.

1805
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:52,220
Oh my god, please let me sing.

1806
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:52,640
Stop!

1807
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,380
Stop!

1808
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:54,080
My HP!

1809
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:20,660
No!

1810
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:21,480
No, my regen!

1811
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,060
My regen!

1812
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:29,220
No, my regen!

1813
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:34,980
My regen!

1814
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:37,780
Where did my regen go?!

1815
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:44,870
Where's Saxton Hell when I need him?!

1816
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:45,210
Please!

1817
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:47,350
Fire him!

1818
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:49,130
He's bullying...

1819
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:50,110
Oh, he would like that.

1820
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:52,090
No, Saxton Hell would like bullying children.

1821
01:55:52,690 --> 01:55:53,350
He's like...

1822
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,080
Okay.

1823
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:12,700
I got this.

1824
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:16,580
Yes, I'm still on this!

1825
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:22,350
It's just like Sans all over again.

1826
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:25,290
I was like, wow.

1827
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:27,490
I have some extra time.

1828
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:29,490
I finished that mod pretty quick.

1829
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:31,750
Let me look at different other mods.

1830
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:32,870
This music though.

1831
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:41,970
No, I fucked up.

1832
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:42,730
I got no regen.

1833
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:57,440
I picked this hell.

1834
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:58,920
I picked this...

1835
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:02,260
I picked this hell for myself and I can't escape!

1836
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:04,460
I can't escape!

1837
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:07,980
I have to finish this to escape from my freedom!

1838
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:17,240
I just can't escape this hell.

1839
01:57:24,490 --> 01:57:27,830
I picked this hell too, that's the worst part.

1840
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:35,020
At least the song's good.

1841
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:46,740
Oh

1842
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,420
my god, I'm...

1843
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:11,880
There has to be a way!

1844
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,100
There has to be a way!

1845
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:15,940
Please!

1846
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:19,800
There has to be a difficulty set.

1847
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:24,060
I refuse to believe that there is no diffic...

1848
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:25,100
I refuse.

1849
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:26,660
I refuse.

1850
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:31,740
There has to be a...

1851
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,300
I refuse.

1852
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:44,420
Oh my god.

1853
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:46,980
What do you mean?

1854
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:50,060
I am at the free play!

1855
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:54,700
There's no other contracts!

1856
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:58,220
There's only one.

1857
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:04,600
There's only one contract.

1858
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,860
That's the worst part.

1859
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,180
Wait, there is other contracts.

1860
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:12,800
Oh my god, there is!

1861
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,160
Goodbye, ScoutJK.

1862
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:18,880
JK, there was other contracts.

1863
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,140
Guys, maybe...

1864
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:31,280
Maybe Pyro would be easier, guys.

1865
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:32,800
Maybe Pyro...

1866
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,860
Guys, maybe he'll be easier!

1867
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:38,340
Maybe...

1868
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,700
Guys, maybe there's freedom.

1869
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,680
Who the fuck is this guy?

1870
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:48,680
Who is he?

1871
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:50,960
It's a shorter song.

1872
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:53,200
Who is he?

1873
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:54,860
I don't remember this guy.

1874
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:58,180
A civilian?

1875
02:00:20,670 --> 02:00:21,830
Oh, I can get money?

1876
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:25,950
What does the money do for me?

1877
02:00:37,670 --> 02:00:38,590
Oh shit.

1878
02:00:39,370 --> 02:00:39,930
I'm gonna get money?

1879
02:00:40,170 --> 02:00:41,010
What does the money do?

1880
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:52,940
I'm gonna get money.

1881
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:56,540
I'm gonna get money.

1882
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,060
That was so close!

1883
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,580
On my first try!

1884
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:35,760
Oh my god, it was so close.

1885
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:39,560
Oh my god, I was right there.

1886
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:43,120
That was so good for a first try.

1887
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,300
I was so locked in.

1888
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,060
I was breathing through my mouth.

1889
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,100
Everything was going so well.

1890
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,480
I was like, this is it.

1891
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:54,200
This is the first time I beat any of their fucking contracts.

1892
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:55,640
This is gonna be it.

1893
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:58,240
I was gonna fucking make a name for myself right here.

1894
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:18,160
Alright.

1895
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:19,380
The money.

1896
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:30,700
I don't have long notes to save me to when I fuck up.

1897
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:38,840
I don't know what the money does.

1898
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:55,600
Oh no, it's the fun part!

1899
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,780
I fell for it again!

1900
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,600
I fell for it.

1901
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:24,060
Let's try this one.

1902
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:26,600
Maybe he won't BS me.

1903
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:30,680
Spy, you won't be that fucked up, right Spy?

1904
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:33,160
Surely not.

1905
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:37,200
The most backstabbing character won't fuck me over like that, right?

1906
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:42,700
What do you mean this one is worse?

1907
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:43,900
What do you mean by that?

1908
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:56,800
Oh my god, maybe Scout was the easiest.

1909
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:28,390
Wait,

1910
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:33,270
Miss Pauling!

1911
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:34,570
She won't fuck me over.

1912
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:35,690
She's so...

1913
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:37,130
Oh no, she's not nice.

1914
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:39,370
Yeah!

1915
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:41,410
Hello, Miss Pauling!

1916
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:51,350
Oh, I'm on the left side?

1917
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:00,480
Oh my god, I'm not used to being on the left side.

1918
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:10,330
Oh my god, I'm not used to being on the left side.

1919
02:06:10,650 --> 02:06:12,010
It's like Tekken all over again.

1920
02:06:12,450 --> 02:06:13,110
Or Street Fighter.

1921
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,460
Miss Pauling won't be so fucked up, right?

1922
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,760
You're so nice to me.

1923
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,400
Wait, no.

1924
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:02,820
Demo, what are you doing here?

1925
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:04,480
Demo, get out of here!

1926
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:06,500
Demo, get out of here!

1927
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:08,800
Demo, no!

1928
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:10,940
No!

1929
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:11,900
Get out of here!

1930
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:12,940
Demo!

1931
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:13,680
No!

1932
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:37,350
Oh no.

1933
02:07:37,830 --> 02:07:38,590
Oh no.

1934
02:07:38,670 --> 02:07:40,830
I still have a minute of Demoman.

1935
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:51,660
Guys, this is not looking too good for me.

1936
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:34,280
Which one is me?

1937
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:44,020
But that was so cheap!

1938
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:50,600
I couldn't tell which one was me.

1939
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:54,280
I thought that was just gonna fit in.

1940
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,360
It was gonna fit in.

1941
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:59,520
Oh my god.

1942
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:02,420
Oh my god.

1943
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:05,360
Demoman!

1944
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:12,760
I was five seconds away!

1945
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,100
Oh my god.

1946
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:20,220
This is a banger song.

1947
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:27,210
Oh my god, I feel so messed up right now.

1948
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:29,090
After this whole switcheroo.

1949
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:32,750
The switcheroo is fucking me up.

1950
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:44,240
Oh, sense of security.

1951
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:45,660
This is the entire game.

1952
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:50,300
Don't ever say I didn't do hard mode.

1953
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:55,040
Succeeding is a different story, but I'm trying my best.

1954
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:03,320
This is the hardest one I've ever played.

1955
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:09,160
The hardest Friday Night Funkin' mod I've ever done.

1956
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,800
As a non-rhythm gamer, please, this is a lot for me.

1957
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:21,160
As a non-rhythm gamer, this is a lot.

1958
02:10:26,530 --> 02:10:27,990
Oh my god, Demo, get out.

1959
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:29,890
Get out, Demo, get out!

1960
02:10:30,370 --> 02:10:30,810
Leave!

1961
02:10:43,090 --> 02:10:44,250
This is my home.

1962
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:45,730
This is my home now!

1963
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:52,920
This is fucking me up, guys.

1964
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:34,760
No!

1965
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,680
Oh my god.

1966
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:44,320
Why are they all like this?

1967
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:46,240
Maybe, guys...

1968
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:48,030
Maybe, maybe, guys...

1969
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,740
Maybe he's easier.

1970
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:53,860
Maybe...

1971
02:11:53,860 --> 02:11:55,200
Maybe...

1972
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:57,190
We'll find the easiest one.

1973
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:00,280
Demo, it's you again.

1974
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:01,620
Get out!

1975
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:25,030
Not that bad.

1976
02:12:26,050 --> 02:12:27,510
Not that bad.

1977
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:50,320
I got the last.

1978
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:20,090
Okay.

1979
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,360
Oh, fuck!

1980
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:47,740
It's so bad.

1981
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:49,940
Guys, guys...

1982
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:51,940
There's still one more.

1983
02:13:52,220 --> 02:13:54,120
We still have one more.

1984
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,060
We still have...

1985
02:13:56,060 --> 02:13:56,780
Soldier.

1986
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,320
We still have soldier.

1987
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:02,440
He can't...

1988
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:03,840
He's illiterate.

1989
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,140
What the fuck is...

1990
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:06,580
What?

1991
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:09,760
Why is the animation different?

1992
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:12,460
What's going on?

1993
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:14,720
Is this like a guest animator?

1994
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:21,140
What?

1995
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:33,700
Who am I?

1996
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:39,600
What?

1997
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:42,200
Am I playing as Soldier or Engie?

1998
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:43,480
I couldn't tell.

1999
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:50,090
I couldn't tell which one I was playing.

2000
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:54,110
Oh, I broke it.

2001
02:14:56,010 --> 02:14:57,270
Guys, I broke the game.

2002
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:04,800
I broke the cutscene.

2003
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:06,920
Oh, there we go.

2004
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,820
I was like...

2005
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:11,080
What is this?

2006
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:12,500
I've never seen this one before.

2007
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:20,320
Team Fabulous 2?

2008
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:21,980
I've never seen that.

2009
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,620
I need more HP.

2010
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:28,620
Why is there no...

2011
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:29,980
Difficulty setting?

2012
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:11,820
No!

2013
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:31,060
This game won.

2014
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:32,380
This game beat me.

2015
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:33,700
I can't...

2016
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:34,700
I can't...

2017
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:36,960
The close...

2018
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:37,300
Okay.

2019
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:40,040
I'll do one more attempt.

2020
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,800
The closest I've ever been...

2021
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:44,480
Was Miss Pauling.

2022
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:46,660
She was the closest.

2023
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:52,180
She was the closest I've ever been.

2024
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,180
She was...

2025
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:57,680
No, I never got close to Scout.

2026
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:00,740
Miss Pauling, at least...

2027
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:03,900
At least I got five seconds left.

2028
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:10,120
She was the closest to victory I've ever had.

2029
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:16,500
I miss Miss...

2030
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:17,880
Oh my god.

2031
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:21,500
When I look at Miss Pauling versus everybody else, it's so slow.

2032
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:22,480
Compare...

2033
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:24,100
And then I get to Demoman.

2034
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:33,050
She's so slow compared to everybody.

2035
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:34,030
I miss that.

2036
02:18:34,370 --> 02:18:36,810
I miss that so much.

2037
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:43,860
Okay.

2038
02:18:56,030 --> 02:18:57,570
She's just chill like that.

2039
02:18:57,670 --> 02:18:59,770
I told you, she's so nice to me.

2040
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:02,790
And then the fucking Demon shows up.

2041
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:06,310
Fucking Scotsman.

2042
02:19:19,670 --> 02:19:20,660
Get out!

2043
02:19:21,140 --> 02:19:21,580
Leave!

2044
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:27,060
You stupid Cyclops!

2045
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:31,900
No, please.

2046
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:31,940
No!

2047
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:33,080
The shift!

2048
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:34,820
The shift threw me off!

2049
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:36,760
The shift threw me off!

2050
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:38,540
The shift.

2051
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:41,540
Whenever he shifts, I don't know what to do.

2052
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:46,740
When it shifts, I get confused.

2053
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:48,920
I get so confused.

2054
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:51,480
Everything goes so fast.

2055
02:20:55,380 --> 02:20:57,300
Kill me first, I guess.

2056
02:20:57,960 --> 02:21:00,380
Get me out of this Friday Night Funkin'.

2057
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:08,820
Oh my god.

2058
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:11,840
Why can't everybody be just like you, Miss Pauling?

2059
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,320
Why can't they be just like you?

2060
02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:51,170
And the music is so chill, guys.

2061
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:54,810
I'm definitely feeling the feeling of chill right now.

2062
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,020
That pussy.

2063
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:13,820
He's here to fuck me up.

2064
02:22:13,980 --> 02:22:14,600
He's here.

2065
02:22:15,060 --> 02:22:16,000
He's here.

2066
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:21,960
Oh my god,

2067
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,140
I already took up most of my HP.

2068
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:02,140
Every time I don't have 10, I actually start with 10 HP.

2069
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:17,880
No!

2070
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:25,340
I'm not strong enough.

2071
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:31,520
Guys, I can't.

2072
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:33,820
Guys, I can't.

2073
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:35,280
I'm not strong enough.

2074
02:23:52,180 --> 02:23:52,980
Guys.

2075
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:55,520
One last.

2076
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,560
One last attempt, guys.

2077
02:23:58,320 --> 02:23:58,840
Guys.

2078
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:02,960
I'm sort of on a time limit.

2079
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:09,840
Because I'm going to a cat cafe at 8 PM.

2080
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:22,120
I just wanted to pet some cats.

2081
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:35,200
I wanted to go outside and touch some cats.

2082
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:39,880
Okay.

2083
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:41,300
Okay,

2084
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:47,940
it does lose my HP more.

2085
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:50,640
I was going to say, what if I just start spamming?

2086
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:52,280
And then I fucked up.

2087
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:10,400
What the fuck?

2088
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:15,740
Have they been saying really fucked up shit at the bottom left?

2089
02:25:16,060 --> 02:25:17,680
I just noticed.

2090
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:19,740
What the fuck was that?

2091
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,660
What the fuck?

2092
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:24,700
I did it.

2093
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:26,740
Oh my god!

2094
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:28,960
No wonder it's so hard.

2095
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:40,320
This is like Team Fortress 2 all over again.

2096
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:46,980
Just a standard TF2 experience.

2097
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:51,240
Okay, guys, I'm just going to pretend I didn't see it.

2098
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:58,240
TF2 is back, baby.

2099
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:02,280
No wonder they don't even have...

2100
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:06,340
They don't even have a difficulty slider for me.

2101
02:26:12,860 --> 02:26:13,740
Goodbye.

2102
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:15,600
I'll do this again next week.

2103
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:22,660
I'll complete one level next week.

2104
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:23,520
I can't.

2105
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:25,160
I can't.

2106
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:29,780
I have an appointment with some kitty cats.

2107
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:36,860
Next week.

2108
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:42,280
I thought this would be a fun little mod to play to kill some time.

2109
02:26:42,820 --> 02:26:43,440
I thought.

2110
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:44,920
I'll post pictures of the cats.

2111
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,580
Okay, guys, I promise I'll post the pictures of the cats later.

2112
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:49,240
I promise you guys that.

2113
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:53,240
I'll post the pictures of the cats, guys.

2114
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:54,220
I promise.

2115
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:56,760
On Twitter.

2116
02:26:57,260 --> 02:26:58,260
I promise.

2117
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:00,140
But for now, I can't.

2118
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:00,940
I don't...

2119
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:11,080
I wanted to relax after the stream.

2120
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,440
And I was like, I've never been to the cat cafe.

2121
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:15,660
I've actually never been to a cat cafe before.

2122
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:16,420
Isn't that crazy?

2123
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:19,480
Not even like in Japan have I went to.

2124
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,420
I went to like the hedgehog cafe and the pig cafe in Japan.

2125
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:26,060
But I've never been to a cat cafe.

2126
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:28,500
And I was like, wait, there's like one.

2127
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:29,460
There's like...

2128
02:27:29,460 --> 02:27:30,780
They opened a new one.

2129
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:32,320
And so I wanted to check it out.

2130
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:33,100
Because I was like, you know what?

2131
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:33,680
Let's bug it.

2132
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:34,200
Let's try it.

2133
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:35,500
Let's check out this cat cafe.

2134
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:37,340
And it's like appointment only.

2135
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:38,700
So I was just like, okay.

2136
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,260
Alright, I'll do it like after my stream.

2137
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:44,340
And I didn't realize this would take up my entire day.

2138
02:27:44,780 --> 02:27:46,460
Fucking Team Fortress 2.

2139
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:53,760
I was like, Team Fortress 2.

2140
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:00,600
Anyway.

2141
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:02,100
Anyway.

2142
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:04,460
I'm gonna fucking.

2143
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:10,300
I'll finish one level next week.

2144
02:28:11,870 --> 02:28:17,020
Next week, I'll come back and finish one level, guys.

2145
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:18,380
It was fun though.

2146
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:20,080
I need my cat therapy.

2147
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:22,200
I need my cat therapy.

2148
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:24,000
As always, everybody.

2149
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:25,260
Stay hydrated.

2150
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:26,500
Posture check.

2151
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:29,500
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2152
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:32,300
And if you stayed up for me, it's a fact.

2153
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:34,080
Because you deserve it.

2154
02:28:34,380 --> 02:28:36,400
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2155
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:37,460
Bye, guys.

2156
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:38,240
Bye.
