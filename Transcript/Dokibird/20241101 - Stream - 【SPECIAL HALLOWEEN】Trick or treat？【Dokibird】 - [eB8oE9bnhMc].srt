00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:38,910
Hey guys, welcome to- welcome dragons to my- what are you talking- welcome everybody to Dokefield's home.

2
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,450
Did you guys bring any lasagna?

3
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,730
What do you mean a costume?

4
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:55,770
We've stumbled into a portal to an alternate universe where I am Dokefield.

5
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:17,690
Hey guys, I've always been a cat.

6
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,190
What are you talking about?

7
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,970
See, look, all you say was that I was born this way.

8
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,310
So I don't know why you're judging me right now.

9
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,290
I've- I've always been a cat.

10
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,190
I've always been an orange tabby.

11
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,830
Do you guys like my happy Halloween?

12
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,830
John?

13
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,370
Who's John, guys?

14
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,770
The only person I know.

15
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,510
What are you guys talking about, dragoons?

16
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,230
There's no John here.

17
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,230
We- we have- look, we have you.

18
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,110
We have this guy.

19
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,790
That's not John.

20
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,970
Oh, you mean dad.

21
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,950
Oh, don't worry.

22
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:08,730
Don't worry.

23
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,250
Uh, Odie, no.

24
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,710
That's one of the dragoons.

25
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,230
You don't recognize your own kind?

26
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,250
Don't worry.

27
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:16,850
Dragoon!

28
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,570
Dragoon, get over here, dragoon.

29
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,330
Get over here.

30
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,830
Run!

31
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,570
I don't know what you're talking about.

32
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,750
Where are you?

33
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,410
Okay.

34
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,590
Yes, um, sorry.

35
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,270
I had, like, some technical difficulties.

36
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,330
I'm so sorry, guys.

37
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,130
I was a little late.

38
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,510
I realized I- I had a little bit of some, uh, technical difficulties going on.

39
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,370
Uh, but, like, you guys can tell why.

40
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,210
Uh, I mean, it was very hard to get this house decorated to fit the theme, you know?

41
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,850
Um, other than that, I've always looked like this.

42
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,490
Uh, I've always, um, I've always looked like this.

43
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,170
I- I don't know what you're talking about.

44
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,490
I mean, it was weird that you came through a green portal.

45
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,910
That- that was a little weird, but other than that, like, everything else was, like, the same.

46
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,170
Oh, you guys- you guys want to meet dad?

47
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,790
You guys want to meet dad?

48
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,790
Dad!

49
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,630
Get over here!

50
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,740
Oh, sorry.

51
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
Let me fix you guys real- real quick.

52
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,980
There you-

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
There's dad right here.

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,320
Uh...

55
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,860
Wait, what do you mean disappointed?

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,600
I don't understand.

57
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,180
What?

58
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,280
No, that's how he's always like.

59
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,180
Guys.

60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,100
Dad, I want my lasagna.

61
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:12,300
I- Dad, where- where is my las- where is my lasagna?

62
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,380
Where is my lasagna, dad?

63
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:30,800
I just- I just- Wow, Dougfield, you spent how much just to make a shit post on Halloween?

64
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,400
What are you talking about?

65
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,620
This- I've always looked like this.

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,720
I- I- I don't know what you guys are talking about.

67
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:50,800
I've- I've always looked like this, but since I've came back in February, this- this is how I've always looked, and I- I don't know why you guys think that- that anything is different.

68
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,200
This is- this has always been- this has always been what I looked like.

69
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,500
I don't know what to say.

70
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,920
I don't know what to say, Dragoons.

71
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,380
Like, I don't know what else to say, guys.

72
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,560
I've always- it's always been like that.

73
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,880
Anyway, all right.

74
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,060
Anyway, dad.

75
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,200
Dookie Amber.

76
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,920
Dookie Amber.

77
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm gonna go back to the room now.

78
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,200
Go make my lasagna.

79
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,240
All right, anyway.

80
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,240
I'll say it, but dad looks low-key white.

81
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,360
What?

82
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,860
That's wrong, dad.

83
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,800
Stop.

84
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,020
Thank you, super chat.

85
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,440
Thank you.

86
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,020
Thank you.

87
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,860
Yes, I've always looked this way.

88
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,320
I- I don't know why everybody's freaking out.

89
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,900
I don't think anything's wrong right now.

90
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,880
Anyway, um...

91
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,680
I hope you guys enjoyed the new- I spookified the intro.

92
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,260
Um, I forgot to make a fancy credits page, so I'm gonna write down the credits at the end of the stream.

93
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,200
Uh, but yeah, we had a lot of people.

94
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:12,180
Um, yeah, we had one person basically, like, uh, well, no.

95
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,360
What am I saying?

96
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,060
This is me.

97
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,280
What am I- what am I saying?

98
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,000
This is me.

99
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Nobody made this.

100
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,300
No.

101
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,060
No, sorry.

102
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,740
Sorry, impression ruined.

103
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,340
Sorry, it's- it's just so hard.

104
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,900
Okay, it's just getting a little difficult.

105
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,180
Minus one RP.

106
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,800
Oh my god.

107
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,600
All right.

108
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,320
Anyway, so, um, yeah, I can- what are you guys looking at, huh?

109
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,840
Chat, what are you guys- oh, wait.

110
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,260
Chat, you guys are- you guys are a little- phew.

111
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,340
Let me fix you guys real quick.

112
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,840
Yeah, what are you guys looking at, chat?

113
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,520
There's nothing weird going on here.

114
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,820
I- I can't even take myself seriously.

115
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,880
Like, wait.

116
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,440
I mean, look at me.

117
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,740
I mean- I mean, look at me.

118
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,360
Like, what- what do you want me to say?

119
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,780
Okay, sorry.

120
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,820
Hey, guys.

121
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,890
I don't know about you guys, but I feel like...

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,280
I don't know why they had Chris Pratt instead of me.

123
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,980
Mondays, am I right?

124
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,540
I- I know.

125
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,800
I- I look- I look very normal.

126
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,900
It's so true.

127
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,940
Mondays, am I right, guys?

128
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,400
Am I right, Dragoons?

129
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,580
Oh my god.

130
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,120
I hate Mondays.

131
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:05,260
I- In the Dokefield universe, it's already Monday.

132
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,560
Every- almost every day is Monday.

133
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,910
Oh my god.

134
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,410
This is- wait, Dragoon, get out!

135
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,850
Get- get out!

136
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,890
This is my- this- this is- this is my stream.

137
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,130
What are you doing here?

138
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,850
This is my stream.

139
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,410
Um, guys, she's losing it.

140
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,130
What do you mean?

141
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,770
It's adorable Halloween.

142
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,070
Damn.

143
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,130
The only thing different is that, you know, I decorated the place a little different, you know?

144
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,110
Like, instead of we're at the- we're at the- the- I almost said salon.

145
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,930
The saloon.

146
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,810
We're at my place.

147
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,890
This is where I live.

148
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,850
You guys like it?

149
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,230
You guys like- yeah.

150
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,450
You guys like my bed?

151
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,870
You guys like- it's like the newest craze.

152
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,890
It's all- it's all the craze for beds, you know?

153
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:16,210
Apparently, when you sleep on the floor, it's better for your back and, um, um, and like, it's good for your back and your muscle and stuff.

154
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,830
So yeah, this is where I sleep.

155
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,870
And then look, I carved a pumpkin over there for you guys.

156
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,670
Yeah, it's just a- just adorable.

157
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,690
Just- don't feel the doki breath.

158
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,930
Yeah, it keeps my back straight and everything.

159
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,570
Um, also, you guys like my- you guys like my- you just have no- no, I have a choice.

160
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,210
I have choices.

161
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,510
I own this place.

162
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,710
That's just- that's just like my waiter.

163
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,270
He brings my lasagna and everything.

164
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,430
Like, I- what are you talking about?

165
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,820
What the fuck?

166
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,000
What do you mean, what the fuck is that?

167
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,620
It's me!

168
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,040
Dokefield!

169
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,060
It's always been Dokefield.

170
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,220
Like, what do you mean?

171
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,240
Sorry, Dokefield.

172
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,500
How am I in danger?

173
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,620
I don't understand, guys.

174
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,740
I- hello.

175
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:16,880
Hello.

176
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,700
All I'm saying is that I feel like you're taking it a little bit, uh, too extreme, um, with your reaction.

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,580
Because, like, nothing- nothing is wrong right now.

178
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:39,500
And, like, I don't understand why everybody is, like, freaking out about, um, the way I look.

179
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,180
It's- I- I feel like I'm being judged at the moment, dragons.

180
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,720
Like, are you guys- are you guys judging me?

181
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,960
Are you- are you guys judging me, chat?

182
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,090
Are you guys judging me?

183
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,870
That's not- that's not becoming of you.

184
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,430
Um, that's- that's a little rude.

185
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,570
That's all I'm saying.

186
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,530
It's a- it's a little rude right there.

187
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,070
Yes.

188
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,430
We can cast light.

189
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,170
We can keep Garfield.

190
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,550
What do you mean Garfield?

191
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,950
It's Dokefield.

193
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:25,250

RP.

199
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,830
Let me- let me go to the- let me go here.

200
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,550
All right, all right.

201
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,990
RP done.

202
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,830
Okay, um, all right, let me explain this.

203
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,070
Let me- let me- let me explain what the fuck is going on.

204
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,910
So, um, yes.

205
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:08,590
I- I may or may not have done all of this just so I could be my hero.

206
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,570
Just so I can be my oshi.

207
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:23,370
It was, um, it took like- I actually planned this a while ago.

208
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:30,130
It's a little sad, but like, you know, I was like- I was like, it's Halloween.

209
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,390
Like, when will I ever have this opportunity again, you know?

210
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,510
Like, it's- it's-

211
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,610
So I was like, oh my god.

212
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,410
It's- it's Halloween.

213
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,730
So like, you know, normally I was like, all right, what do I do for Halloween?

214
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,390
And I was like, oh my god.

215
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,750
I could be my hero.

216
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,230
Yeah, I could- I could- I could- yes, yes, yes, chat.

217
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,450
I- I spent a lot just so I could shitpost on Halloween.

218
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,770
And was it worth it?

219
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,970
Yes, it was worth it.

220
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,370
It was indeed worth it, chat.

221
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,870
It was indeed so worth it.

222
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,190
Anyway.

223
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,810
Also, um, you guys can also show up here.

224
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,450
Give me a sec.

225
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:32,830
Where is it?

226
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,650
Oh, there you guys are.

227
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,410
Here you are.

228
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,050
Look at that.

229
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,110
You're over here, too.

230
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,390
That's all.

231
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,150
That's all that- That's- that's all that matters.

232
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,810
You guys can come back again, too.

233
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,150
Watch.

234
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,610
Look, see?

235
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,570
Look at you guys.

236
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,350
You need to talk about your spending.

237
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,470
What do you mean?

238
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,230
This is money well spent.

239
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,050
I- I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

240
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,150
How dare you judge me?

241
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,410
How- how dare- wait, let me see.

242
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,450
How- How dare you judge me?

243
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,510
How could you guys?

244
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,150
I can't believe you guys would judge me like that.

245
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,830
Like, I- I don't understand.

246
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,130
I don't- look, now I'm not happy anymore.

247
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,170
I don't understand why you would judge me like this.

248
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:24,670
I feel like the money I spent on today was so worth it because like, I mean, look.

249
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:36,970
When- when can I ever have a chance to have- to be TocField when- This is- this is where your super chat goes to.

250
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:48,530
This is where your super chat goes to.

251
00:16:49,490 --> 00:17:11,250
Yes, instead of- instead of buying, um, naturally, um, um, instead of buying furniture or plates or like, you know, or like a Roomba or like unpacking or, you know, or like basic necessities or cutlery too.

252
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,770
I spent my money on TocField and I think- I think it was worth it.

253
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,090
I think-

254
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,410
I think it was honestly one of the smartest investments I ever made in my career.

255
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:50,450
Um, also I need you guys to know that like I've actually been planning this for like even before- even before I came back, I've always wanted to do this, but I was never like a more, you know, a more like parody wise, you know, not straight up like fuck that's- that's- that's TocField right there,

256
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,130
but-

257
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:07,030
Like I've actually been planning this for like at least a year, but I was never able to do it like logistically wise like, you know, red tape and everything even if it was like more of a parody, but like now!

258
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,070
Now!

259
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,470
Who's gonna stop me?

260
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,880
Who's gonna stop me now?

261
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,740
No one!

262
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,760
No one can stop me now!

263
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,980
This is what happens when you give me too much freedom, guys.

264
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,860
This is what happens.

265
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,040
This is my mind on freedom juice.

266
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,060
This is what goes in my mind.

267
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,400
You know, other people they're like, yeah!

268
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:10,040
You know, yeah, so anyway, um, um, it was really cute that um, uh, by the way that animation in the beginning that was done like within- the animation itself was done within like three days.

269
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,540
Um, it was like a last minute idea I had.

270
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:23,840
I like contacted one of the animators that I had like, you know, one of the animators that I know and I was like, uh, like a week ago, I think a week and a half ago and I was like, can you do this?

271
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,380
And they were like, I'm on vacation.

272
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,440
I'm on vacation, but- but I could do it on the 28th.

273
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:47,920
So then they actually- they actually like did it, um, they actually animated this from the 28th and then the 3D modelers made the models within a week and oh my god, I need to show you guys.

274
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,300
Okay, they're so cute.

275
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:57,240
Let me show you guys the concepts, the- the costumes that they um, the costumes that they like, uh, made for it.

276
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,220
Oh my god.

277
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:10,480

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,460

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:15,840
Okay, anyway.

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,440
Anyway, um, this is so good.

282
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,660
Anyway, I'm sorry.

283
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,360

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,380
I'm getting distracted there.

285
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,780
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,260

288
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,060
Um, as I was saying, let me- let me grab the concept.

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,780
All right, real quick for you guys.

290
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:57,880
So, um, I don't know if you guys saw but uh, um, I- uh, I was giving like costume designs to give you guys and to be like, all right, like what kind of costumes do I- do I- do I want to give you guys and the one of them that I was so happy about was the fact that um,

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:08,840
they gave you- they gave the chonky goons, um, they gave the chonky goons, um, a sexy cat costume and I was like, oh my god, that's perfect.

292
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,500

293
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,200

I'm so sorry.

297
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,580
I can't-

298
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,840
I can't believe it.

299
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:36,780
I can't believe this is my head when I'm- this is my head when I'm fucking shit- Okay, okay, let me uh, let me- Sorry, I'm getting distracted.

300
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,860
I'm just- I don't know.

301
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,940
I just look so beautiful.

302
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,600
I don't know.

303
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,700
I mean, look at me.

304
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm like- I mean, I mean, come on.

305
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,440
I mean, come on.

306
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,400
Come on guys.

307
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,440
Look, I know you're- look, come on.

308
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,560
I see you guys looking.

309
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,040
I see you guys looking over there.

310
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:13,240
I love that like- I love the fact that people sort of instantly knew um, what the surprise was because like they saw the- they saw the whiskers.

311
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,700
Reality can be whatever I want.

312
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,400
Zekro, thank you for the super chat.

313
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:18,740
Thank you.

314
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,340
Thank you.

315
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,900
But you guys literally saw the thumbnail and like these guys saw the whiskers and were like, oh my god.

316
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:26,960
No.

317
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,440
No, it can't.

318
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,960
It can't be.

319
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,820
There's no way.

320
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,680
Does she actually do it?

321
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,580
There's no way.

322
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,500
There's no way she actually did it.

323
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Oh, but joke's on you.

324
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,660
I did.

325
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,200
That's right, I have too much money now.

326
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,760
I have too much money.

327
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,320
I have too much money.

328
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,860
Okay, um Um, all right.

329
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,100
Sorry.

330
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,640
I actually need to show you guys.

331
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,720
So here are like the concept art.

332
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,640
So this is by- this was done by Nim.

333
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,460
Um, I'll show like the twitter profile like- oh, I'll show the twitter profiles later.

334
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,300
But this is by Nim, the concept art.

335
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
So you can see there was like several concepts.

336
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,720
So there was- obviously I chose the sexy cat because I thought I was like fit.

337
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,620
And then I gave you guys the mummy and then there's the halloween basket too.

338
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,280
So these were like the choices that you could have been.

339
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,460
What you could have been in the halloween animation.

340
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,780
But yeah, like I said had the idea like very last minute regarding the animation because I was like, how the fuck do I transition to Garfield?

341
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,120
I was just like, what do I do?

342
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,740
How do I- how do I transition to this?

343
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,840
Like I can't just instantly, you know

344
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,200
I can't just instantly bring you guys there.

345
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,760
