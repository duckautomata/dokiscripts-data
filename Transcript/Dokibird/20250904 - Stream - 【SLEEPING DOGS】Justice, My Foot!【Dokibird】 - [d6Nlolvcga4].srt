00:01:47,280 --> 00:03:00,800
hello everybody hello hello we are back with more sleeping dogs where's my controller speaking of sleeping dogs i actually forgot all the controls for this game because we skipped a week of it uh because i was on my silk uh i was on my holo night era there uh trying to cram holo night as much as i can before silk slot releases tomorrow so i forgot how to play this again um this is that's it's the worst part about being a variety streamer um it's when uh you know because um i play a different game every day um like almost every day um so but when i come back to it you know a week later i come back to it it's just i'm like what are the controls because i have to remember five different controls as is tradition i know it's like but i know i think it's more so because it's really interesting because I've talked about this before but the audiences for YouTube and Twitch is very different in a way where YouTube people the audience on YouTube they like variety more in more of a way where

2
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:41,060
every day is a they want they they prefer to watch like you know something different every day so you don't want to play one thing all the time and but on on Twitch usually it's not really like what you're playing in a way so you can actually play a bunch of different things back to back to back for one day they also stream longer too I don't know how they do it I don't there's like there's no actual like order to like whatever they are playing because they like it's not really very easy to I feel like it's not very easy to watch Twitch VODs YouTube VODs,

3
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,340
because YouTubers, when we make a waiting room, it's usually that game.

4
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,020
But for Twitch streamers, they are more so of like, they don't really have a plan on what's going on.

5
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,300
They just stream whatever they want to stream.

6
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,640
And I feel like watching Twitch VODs is a lot harder than it is to watch YouTube VODs.

7
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,860
Just because it's like, I think it's more so like, you know, there's a lot of stuff, there's a lot of stuff going on.

8
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:35,900
as well so you don't really know what part we're at and it's not very like you know it's not very like organized very well so in terms of like what is what uh which is very interesting um and i don't understand how they i i don't know where they get their endurance from too because twitch streamers can stream for like um seven plus hours every day i i envy that because like after every

9
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:56,360
I like disassociate for like an hour or two because like I put all my energy in streaming And then after that, it's like, you know, my battery is sort of like dead at that point And I was like recharge mode I like I just disassociate for an hour or two,

10
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:05,800
depending on how long I stream for it And usually it's not even that long And then I just like like battery dead and I'm just like recharge Yeah, I'm like, recharging

11
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,880
me after every stream's over i'm like recharging

12
00:05:20,060 --> 00:06:22,860
um solid snake thank you for the super chat thank you thank you don't worry dokey don't just grapple them and make them kiss the walls those are the controls easy thank you the super chat thank you thank you thank you boy thank you for the super chat thank you thank you hey your friends and you feel like streaming dokey anyway better get those one liners ready thank you thank you um but yeah it's it i i don't know how they do it i think it's also because like all my streams are like super high energy um like consistently throughout it because i don't like dead air that much so like i'm always like talking and i'm always laughing i'm always high energy so for me it's definitely is a lot harder and i'm also very aware of vocal cord stuff like even then like i still get i'm still very afraid of like you know um um damaging my vocal cords too much so i do try to like limit myself and i don't i try to limit myself and try not to like stream for like too much just because i know like how

13
00:06:22,860 --> 00:07:26,700
much streaming can affect that because i still feel like we don't really have we've already seen like not even like long-term effects but already like some streamers are um experiencing effects on long period of time of just like two years of streaming especially when they're like you can tell that you know um and usually people don't recover from that too because i don't know if you guys didn't know for vocal cords um the biggest damage you can do is like those like notes like swelling in the notes and um and then it caused like bumpiness on your vocal cords and from that it's really hard for you to actually like uh recover from um from stuff like that and um and like usually it's like actually like you have to get surgery at that point if you have especially it's like it's basically career ruining in terms of like for singers and stuff because uh you don't sing the same same as like you used to um and it's harder like you don't hit the notes that you used to so like i try to be very

14
00:07:26,700 --> 00:08:03,340
aware um of stuff like that yeah even my voice has changed if Even my voice has changed over time Because of like how long I've been streaming But for me, I talk in I don't like this is my natural voice So like I'm not pitching myself higher Or anything You might recognize like how But then you're just like oh no Like in the past you used to talk a lot higher Yes because when I first started out Maybe even higher.

15
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,880
I don't even know.

16
00:08:03,940 --> 00:09:19,660
I can't really replicate that anymore because um, I was also very nervous when I'm streaming Um, when I get really nervous, I Pitched myself higher and it was like I don't stream that much as well Um, so I used to talk like this all the time and this was my normal speaking voice And it's actually crazy because I At that time that was Um That was my uh my normal speaking voice at that time um because like i when i streamed because like i was so like for that i don't know why i think that's just really nervous and then i just consistently talked like that all the time but then over time over time i like like slowly went back into my like natural voice because this is like how even then i think i still think there's sort of a streamer like I would sort of say this is like a little bit like my streamer streamer voice as well because off stream I talk a lot softer um it's actually crazy I actually talk a lot softer off stream I don't know but it's more so because like also because like I'm

17
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:36,060
trying to save my voice too off stream um and I'm not like you know I'm not performing you know I'm not streaming to So, off-stream, I actually talk in a lot softer voice because I need to save my, I need to save it for, I need to save it, and I don't want to,

18
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,320
like, strain myself too much or anything.

19
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,900
And, you know, I'm not entertaining anybody.

20
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm just talking to friends or, like, talking to my manager.

21
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,940
And, yeah, when, if you guys ever see me, when I don't stream my POV on stuff, I do sound a little different.

22
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,600
Just because, like, you know, in my head, I'm like, I'm not entertaining anyone.

23
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,120
Like, it's just me.

24
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm like if I am on your stream you entertain I'm just here like I'm just a plus one I if I'm not streaming and I'm just a plus one if it's a collab then I will like be I would be more like you know trying to do stuff for the stream But if it's like, you know,

25
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,440
it's my off day and I'm playing rank.

26
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:39,520
If it's my off day and I'm playing rank or like if someone needs a plus one, I'm like, I just like, like, I just go like a lot softer because I'm like, I'm not streaming.

27
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,340
I'm just hanging out, you know.

28
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,920
Doom guy, thank you for super chat.

29
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,140
Thank you.

30
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,580
Thank you.

31
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,560
A man who never eats pork bun is never a whole man.

32
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,560
That is so true.

33
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,560
That should be like.

34
00:10:55,640 --> 00:12:07,400
on those like um on those inspirational posters where the cat is just hanging on the tree uh yosh thank you the super chat thank you thank you on a question yoki what the fuck are park buns english is not my first language it's basically a bun with pork in it that's i don't know how to explain it it's a very hot bun with some pork inside like you but it's like bread and pork there you go whoa I know mind-blowing also um there's something really fucking stupid yesterday um and also like okay so um um yes I doki today you did something stupid like you did something stupid now yesterday so basically um uh I okay so this is something I've always wanted to do but like my parents never let me do it because like I don't know they always made a lot of excuse being like oh um you gotta measure everything and like it's just it's so much work to do so like I always had you know like when the sun starts shining when you're sleeping and the sun starts shining and then you wake up because the sun in

35
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:15,220
your like it's just too bright in your room and you wake up but you just want to you want to and you want to go back to sleep but you can't Because, you know, the room is too bright.

36
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,460
And the curtains don't really, like, block the sun.

37
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,000
So, there's something I've been wanting to do for, like, the longest time.

38
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,920
And it was to buy, like, those, like, blackout curtains just to keep my room, like, pitch black.

39
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,440
Because, like, I just... I don't care.

40
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,240
Like, I don't care about natural light.

41
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,820
Like, I just... I just want to sleep, you know?

42
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,700
I...

43
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,380
No, because I just wake up, like, a normal...

44
00:12:43,440 --> 00:13:51,040
person so um i finally uh i bought blackout curtains like a few days ago and i got i got them like i finally decided to like put them up uh yesterday and i realized i bought the wrong size so it covers like half the window because it's a giant ass window like it's like it takes up the window is like two-thirds of my of the wall so so like it basically okay i'll draw what it looks like and and like the thing is i don't use like curtains for it they basically gave me like these velcro stickers and i just stick it on the glass and then like i just it's like fabric like i just it's not funny i don't because i was like i don't know how like because there's already like curtains like those blinders so i i couldn't really you know i live by myself so i can't like fucking take the blinders out and then and i rent the place too so it's like i can't really take that down because i'm worried i'll damage something so it's really me just like it's just me taping fabric onto my window so so okay

45
00:13:51,040 --> 00:14:03,340
it's like so it's like the fabric is just it covers half of this and then there's the sun yay

46
00:14:07,720 --> 00:15:22,360
okay here all right this is basically what it looks like um because i don't know what the size is of my way i just literally okay i should have measured it but at that time i couldn't find my tape measure and i didn't want to buy a new set of tape i just didn't want to buy another tape measure i have like five tape measures scattered around my apartment and i don't know where any them more i don't know so so it basically it basically um um it works though i still have blinders so i i use the blinders for the top half but they're still light because it doesn't really like do anything to be fair like like the blinders don't really help a lot but it does it the black the black curtains does help a little bit it's not as bright only half sunlight comes in um so so i basically like taped half the fabric uh you know i mean all the fabric so i just like you know i got the fabric and i just velcroed it onto the glass and i'm like okay that's good enough so yesterday i bought i bought this

47
00:15:22,360 --> 00:16:00,340
another i bought the same credits and then today i realized wait i could have got longer Kurt I could have bought longer blackout curtains because there were two more options and they were both big I basically bought the smallest ones so I mean to be fair it was I it was just I just needed another half so it's fine I just so I was like oh wait they came there's another side So the one I bought was 148 width and 100 centimeters for height.

48
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,100
But the other options was literally like 255 centimeters.

49
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,620
And I was like, oh, I should have got that one.

50
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,740
That's double the size.

51
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,380
And that would have, that one would have really helped.

52
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,300
I was like, oh yeah.

53
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,260
You know what?

54
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
But I bought 255.

55
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,420
That would have covered my entire window.

56
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,020
So, I mean, to be fair, it was 50% done.

57
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,240
So, at least if I buy the same one, what do I need a toolbox for?

58
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,520
They gave me Velcro.

59
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,540
They gave me Velcro.

60
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,820
I just put it on the glass and then stick my fabric on there.

61
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,220
It worked 50% of the time.

62
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,520
It worked 50%.

63
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,420
So, yeah, so it's fine.

64
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,540
For your tape measures.

65
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,680
somewhere in my apartment.

66
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,520
I'll eventually find it.

67
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,440
I'll eventually find it.

68
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,440
So, you know, I'm slowly learning about life, you know.

69
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:14,040
It's like, it's like you chucked a newborn baby out into the real world and it's like, you gotta learn everything from zero.

70
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,440
Here's an apartment.

71
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,740
You gotta learn everything from zero.

72
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,780
And I'm like, do I get any help?

73
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,640
Here's Google and Amazon.

74
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,900
I'm like, okay, oh.

75
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:49,120
Also, also, I, yes, I did crash out after completing Hollow Knight True Ending because I found out that I could have completed the game, maybe 50, like, I could have completed the game maybe in, like, maybe in six hours or less.

76
00:17:49,780 --> 00:18:16,540
If I had all my nail up Okay, I I need some one of you guys to rat this person out the reason why I like Mentally blocked the nail upgrade is because there was this one person's comment that lived rent free in my head Like every time ever since I started Hollow Knight and this person was like said if anyone can rat them out for me

77
00:18:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
I I need to know who this person is but this person said said in my chat or in the comments on or the youtube comments i don't remember they said you don't oh if you upgrade your nail the the nails upgrades will scale the bosses hp so that comment lived in my head because i kept thinking plus two should be fine because because then i don't want to scale too much of those bosses and then after i after like this morning i was like i need a no i need a fucking no like is this true and then i googled it and it was it literally was they were like oh yeah only some bosses like the dream warriors and i'm like this fucker

78
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:48,420
I could have I could have had plus a four nail oh my god I could have had plus four nail killing majority of these bosses the true one guide I that one guy made the stream 10 hours long

79
00:19:53,660 --> 00:20:03,520
And, and so, I didn't realize that Radiance does not scale at all.

80
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,360
Radiance did not scale at all to the nail upgrades.

81
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,400
And also, like, all the other bosses, other than Dream Warrior, but, like, who fucking cares?

82
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,440
The Dream Warriors were so easy.

83
00:20:20,840 --> 00:21:38,280
Like, I, like, the Dream Warriors, I literally, like, like one shot like not once I first tried all of them and like the four plus four nail would have helped the thing is I survived so long too that's the thing with my plus two nail I survived so long because but but like if I had plus three or plus four like I could have definitely killed them like I would kill them like the least amount like lesser tries because I was already doing really well with survivability because I was doing like fucking toothpick damage on them it was taking forever to kill them because eventually I will get hit like it's not like it's not like I will survive forever because eventually I will get hit because I'm not a fucking like speed run TSA inputter that would input these kind perfectly like I was doing it because I found out because I was googling I was like okay how bad was it how bad was the plus two nail and then I and then people were saying and I looked at the comments and people were saying that

84
00:21:38,280 --> 00:22:40,200
my nail um my like my plus two uh was did was like uh was like uh 10 or like 13 damage uh it was 13 damage and i could have had 21 and i'm like oh my i could have cut this in half i was surviving long enough i was surviving long enough to like like i could have actually i think i could have killed radiance in less than 10 tries i i felt like i could have radius of less than 10 tries if i had plus 21 i i survived long enough for it boy i i'm all i'm saying is that i lived so fucking long i dodged so many things like

85
00:22:45,760 --> 00:23:04,560
so i was i was literally playing with a handicap because of this one i got one guy so many times but that i don't know how i do it i will always read the wrong person in chat i don't know how i do it i just magically chose the wrong guy like

86
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:54,840
that was the old somehow it's always this one guy that gets to me out of everything and then the thing is i see no people are like oh but we were kept yelling at you to upgrade your nail and change your build and upgrade your build but i kept thinking about that one guy that one guy that was like if you upgrade your nail it scales the bosses and i was like if i'm where i can't know i was like in my head i was like i can't have radians have more hp i'm already fucking i'm gonna cry i i was like i'm gonna cry i don't want him to have more hp i'm gonna cry if he gets more hp

87
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:21,000
at that point and that's why i never upgraded my nail and then i found out and then after i killed after i killed it after the stream was done the 10 hour stream was done there people were saying wow she should have upgraded her now because it doesn't scale the boss's any game.

88
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,340
It's 10 hours.

89
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
It could have been a five-hour stream.

90
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,220
It really could have.

91
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,300
It really could have.

92
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,860
Anyway.

93
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,360
Anyway, let's play sleeping dogs and relearn the controls.

94
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,700
I like this game, though.

95
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,360
I really, I've been really enjoying it.

96
00:24:44,440 --> 00:25:34,640
It won't be a very long stream today because tomorrow is still song release and we're going to be doing a long um we're going to be doing a long uh a long stream for silk song also the people who were like you could have asked chat at that point i was too far gone at that point at that point i was so invested in beating radiance that like i i didn't want to stop because if i stop give up and upgrade my gear they win who are no they will they win if i leave if i leave and change my loadout they win

97
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:56,840
I was not giving up I was too invested with what I have Because I knew if I bash my head against the wall Hard enough and enough times It will come down I don't need a change

98
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,360
Don't let them win Who is there?

99
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,540
They will win if I left.

100
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,480
If I left, because that meant I gave up.

101
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,640
And I didn't give up.

102
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,920
This is the Doki Way.

103
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,940
We need this on our men.

104
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,940
Thank you for your super chat.

105
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,280
Thank you, thank you.

106
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,340
You know, they, no, they win if I turn around.

Anyway, let's play Sleeping Dog.

109
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,620

I thought you were so cool and la-la-la and an easy, eh?

114
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,960
But I knew you were trouble.

115
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,240
How could you dump Ryan Gosling?

116
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,720
How could you?

117
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,840
He owned a jazz club.

118
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,040
He owned a fucking jazz club.

119
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,900
All right.

120
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,240
There's how she was at Easy A.

121
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,720
Biggest fumble in history.

122
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,660
Exactly.

123
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,140
She fumbled hard.

124
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,060
Max, thank you for the super chat.

125
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,360
Thank you.

126
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:22,960
Thank you.

127
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,880
Two scoops.

128
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,700
You should go to the night market and get the funny straw hat.

129
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,720
They are super chat.

130
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:27,940
Thank you.

131
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,300
Thank you.

132
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,160
Oh, where's the night market?

133
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,160
I love night markets.

134
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,640
They're always so fun.

135
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,280
Asian night markets are so cool.

136
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,580
All right.

137
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,940
There's a fish market.

138
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,700
Dad left.

139
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,840
He's like, who's there?

140
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,280
He's like, please stop yelling about them.

141
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,780
Whoever they are.

142
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,240
All right.

143
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,260
He actually just left.

144
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,400
He left my room.

145
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,940
He was sleeping in my room in the bed next to me.

146
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,800
And then he left.

147
00:28:59,420 --> 00:28:59,620
All right.

148
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,860
We might as well return to Jade Statue since we're here.

149
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,220
All right.

150
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,660
He's like, oh my, please be quiet.

151
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,960
Okay, I don't remember.

152
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,040
Okay, there's the cake.

153
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,280
I remember all my controls, so.

154
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,540
Okay.

155
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,620
I feel like it's not that many anyway.

156
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,620
All right, um...

157
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,480
Grab my cruiser.

158
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,560
I feel like the cruiser is pretty fast.

159
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:25,880
Okay.

160
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,260
Whoops.

161
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,160
I don't want to change my music again.

162
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,780
Okay, there you go.

163
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,360
Ninja...

164
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,040
Whoa!

165
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,640
I'm trying to remember how to drive this.

166
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:48,980
Oh!

167
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,780
Big horse!

168
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,120
We're just listening to ads right now.

169
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,690
Where the fuck is the sun?

170
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,310
Whoa!

171
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,870
Oh my god, learn my kung fu.

172
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,950
I gotta learn my kung fu.

173
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,710
How do I run?

174
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,110
Oh my god.

175
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:11,570
Wait, no.

176
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,450
Safety first.

177
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,050
Wait, guys, give me a second.

178
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,170
I gotta learn how to run.

179
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,310
Okay, it's A.

180
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,970
Hold A.

181
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,350
No, it's not copyright free.

182
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,490
I got copyright strike.

183
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,630
But, like, it's more so they just take my ad review, so that's fine.

184
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,670
It doesn't matter.

185
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,110
Wonderful.

186
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,070
I understand your sister passed.

187
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,050
She was an addict.

188
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:29,990
She couldn't kick it.

189
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,810
It's not a very interesting story.

190
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,710
I suppose.

191
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,350
But in light of that, my whole $5.

192
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:36,930
My whole $5.

193
00:30:37,670 --> 00:31:00,250

198
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,170

199
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,410
How did I decide?

200
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,030
I did not.

201
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,430
He's still holding it.

202
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,110
Okay, there we go.

203
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,610
I was gonna say, what do you mean?

204
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,810
He's still holding his fucking stick.

205
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:29,910
Okay.

206
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,850
Go pick it back up.

207
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,590
Okay, I did it.

208
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,710
That should be everything.

209
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,350

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,170

It was alright.

222
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,450
To have two homes is to have two souls.

223
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,370
Well, how do I counter again?

224
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,990
What if you never feel at home anywhere?

225
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:19,350

226
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,110

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,990

You know what sucks?

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,730
He's being paid.

236
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,990
He's being paid to get beat up by me while I'm just here returning.

237
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,530
I did get this for free.

238
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,210
I get this for free.

239
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,730
He has to be, he has to pay lessons to get beat up by me.

240
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,570
What an honor.

241
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,530
Oh, I have the whole, hold me.

242
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,650

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,050
See, fool.

244
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,290
What do I do next?

245
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,070

247
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,650
Now what?

248
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,630
Oh, that's right.

I'll eventually learn.

250
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,430
I'll eventually learn what to do.

251
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:28,930
Oh, there we go.

252
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,650
Was that it?

253
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,550
See, fool.

254
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,290
Was that it?

255
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:32,950
I don't know.

256
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,010
Okay.

257
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,130

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,340
I hate this move.

281
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,280
It's so hard to set up.

282
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,980

283
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,300

286
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,360

287
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,840
Fuck this.

288
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,020
I'll just beat them up until they're over.

289
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,100
There you go.

290
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,100
Mission accomplished.

291
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,980
I just beat them up hard enough until they decide to leave.

292
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,740
I might not have done the actual move, but they all gave up.

293
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,560
And that's like, that's good enough.

294
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,780
That's actually good enough for me.

295
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,620
All right, new case.

296
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,680
Oh, here.

Okay, where I go here.

298
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,120
All right.

299
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,480
All right.

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,860

New channel.

302
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,420
I want to hear some Chinese music.

303
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,620
I don't care about these English ones.

304
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,260
I can play GTA for that.

305
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,680
Give me some Kanto Pop.

306
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,180
All right.

307
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,100
Okay, that's just...

308
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,840

309
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,660

310
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,660
Oh, hey, Golden Dragon.

311
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:51,920
Bum-bum.

312
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,520
What the fuck?

313
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,340
What is this?

314
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,600

It's H-Club for life.

317
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,960
Some disco pop.

318
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,980
What the fuck?

319
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,160

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,300
Where's my cantopop?

321
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,920
Oh, that was what he's saying in Chinese.

322
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,820
I heard it.

323
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,200
Right here.

324
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,560
Inspector.

326
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,100

She was in the way!

366
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,600
I was taking a shortcut!

367
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,080
I was taking a shortcut, guys.

368
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
She was in the way!

369
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,500
It was an accident!

370
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,420
Oh my god, I don't remember how to drive.

371
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,420
Why would you just stand her in the middle?

372
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,940
Like, what's wrong with me?

373
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:24,720

374
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,740
i don't know if i could win this race that guy so fast.

375
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,280
At least it's not like fucking mafia where you have to be first place.

376
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,500
Because that car I fucking sucked.

377
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,320
I remember.

378
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,900
Why would you stand in front of the cars?

379
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,000
She could have stood in the side.

380
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,240
That's all I'll say.

381
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,880
Why did she not stand on the side and then drop her fucking handkerchief or whatever?

382
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,980
She's the one that's stupid.

383
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,480
Okay.

384
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,940
Like, that's just evolution working.

385
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,000
That's just Darwinism at that point.

386
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:24,730
Look, I'm just doing survival the fittest right now, and I'm the fittest.

387
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,770
Natural selection at play.

388
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,390
Where I go here?

389
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,370
Oh, I am first.

390
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:47,760
Chad, if it was a man standing in the center, he would have met, I would have accidentally ran him over just the same, it didn't matter.

391
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,700
I chose my shortcut.

392
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,300
Good win, lucky for you, the one last man in the way, one in a million shot.

393
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,280
You want a rematch?

394
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,400
Yeah, sure.

395
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,640

I assume that guy is for racing.

402
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,700
I don't want to race them.

403
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,940
What the fuck is this song?

404
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,900

I'll use... Oh, that's good.

457
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,380
I use my car as, like, a little booster seat.

458
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,680
What do you say?

459
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,580
What did you say?

460
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,700
Say you're sorry right now.

461
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,740
Say you're sorry.

462
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,320
That's fucking right.

463
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:41,820
Come on.

464
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,960
Say you're sorry.

465
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,080
You know who the fuck I am?

466
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,340
I mean, I'm a nobody, but still.

467
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,800
Do you know who I am?

468
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,400
That's fucking right.

469
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,720
Say you're sorry!

470
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,340
That's right!

471
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,140
That's right.

472
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,080
Look at this weak ass.

473
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,700
Alright.

474
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:04,900
Oh!

475
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,780
Oh, you want to fight?

476
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,540
That's fucking right.

477
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,180
Get out of here.

478
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,700
Move out of Hong Kong.

479
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,140
That's on him.

480
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,620
That was literally self-defense.

481
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,300
All I did was grab him a little.

He threw that punch.

486
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,540
Hey, don't try that shit.

487
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,180
You got something to say, talk.

488
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,660
It's too easy.

489
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,600
This guy comes out of nowhere.

490
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,460
Just the dog guy is pressing us.

491
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,460
Oh, I'm scared.

492
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,280
I knew it when he was a kid.

493
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,160
Yeah, it's been since.

494
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,260

Oh, shit.

498
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,540
I was too busy listening.

499
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,140
I didn't realize.

500
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,180
Hey, I'm getting some noodles from the kitchen.

501
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,660

Calibrating.

00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,280

537
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,860

538
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,420

559
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,480
I got something else.

560
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,500
I got another important thing to do.

561
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:23,780
Where is he?

562
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,340
Where?

563
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,450
That's fucking right.

564
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,230
Oh, you're so lucky.

565
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:34,490
That's fucking right.

566
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:37,210
That's right.

567
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,050
That's right.

568
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:41,430
You ain't leaving.

569
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,210
Get back here.

570
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,230
Not only that.

571
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,190
Get over here.

572
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:50,590
Get up.

573
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,750
Get up!

00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,670
Oh, you see me?

575
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,650
I can't see no.

576
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:58,970
Where is it?

577
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:00,390
Give me that car.

578
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,290
That's fucking right.

579
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,090
That's...

580
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:04,850
Hey, what?

581
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,250
Wait, what you saying?

582
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:08,870
Get out of this car.

583
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,590
Get out of this car.

584
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,510
That's fucking right.

585
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,870
Get over here.

586
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,430
All right, you're next.

587
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,470
You have something to say too?

588
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,070
Oh, you have something to say too?

589
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,430
Get out of this car!

590
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:31,430
That's so cute, right?

591
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:36,010
Yeah, I'm not stealing your car.

592
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,070
I'm teaching you a fucking lesson.

593
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,850
What about you?

594
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:41,990
Huh?

595
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:42,530
What?

596
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,090
Get out!

597
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,250
Get out!

598
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:49,170
Alright.

599
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,410
You're gonna bow gang?

600
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,450
I am the police!

601
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,650
That's right.

602
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:57,650
Oh!

603
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:59,830
You wouldn't do something, too?

604
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,530
Get over here!

605
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:04,230
How about you?

606
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:07,090
Alright, he's fine.

607
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:07,910
He's cool.

608
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,570
Alright, let's go back.

609
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,330
Alright, there we go.

610
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,430
We fixed it.

611
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,390
We broke the cycle.

612
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,030
Guys, we broke the cycle.

613
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:27,390
Everything's okay now.

614
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,510
Clean up is complete.

615
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:36,990
It's okay.

616
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:38,250
We broke the cycle.

617
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,850
They all learned their lesson.

618
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:45,690
It only took a couple of bodies for them to realize what they did wrong.

619
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,730
They all realized what...

620
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:51,570
They did wrong.

621
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:55,850
Let's see.

622
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,430
How do I get over there?

623
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,330
Can I swim?

624
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,250
I should be able to swim, right?

625
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:05,150
Video games do not cause violence, I think.

626
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,410
Where the fuck are all the boats?

627
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,510
I'm gonna swim over there.

628
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,990
Go away, go!

629
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:16,670
That's right.

630
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,130
The ocean won't stop you from gambling.

631
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,150
It's okay.

632
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:30,550
It's not going to be like that powwow stream when I try to go to the oil rig.

633
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,770
This will be different.

634
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:36,950
It's alright.

635
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:38,270
I'm a...

636
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,110
I'll be Olympic medalist.

637
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,170
Wait for me, girl.

638
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:45,930
Girl is dedicated.

639
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,390
We won't let them win.

640
00:59:51,890 --> 01:00:22,150

641
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,830
It didn't stop the Titanic.

642
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,490
The iceberg stopped the Titanic.

643
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,590
That's just physical water.

644
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,710
I'm talking about liquid water.

645
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,150
Ain't no icebergs around me.

646
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,010
I will conquer the ocean.

647
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,130
How the fuck do I get up there?

648
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:44,470
Oh my.

649
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:44,750
Okay.

650
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:45,650
100.

651
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:46,770
We're so close.

652
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,450
I can see the promised land.

653
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,590
Right there!

654
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:57,790
It's almost there!

655
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,610
Oh my god, and then they spawned a boat in!

656
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,990
The game was like, please, we do not want you to swim all the way back.

657
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,690
Here is a boat.

658
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:14,590
I am the iceberg.

659
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:24,090
Yeah, they spawned a boat for me because they're like, We don't want you to do this on the road home.

660
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:27,490
Alright.

661
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,150
Hello.

662
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,510
I am here for the promised land.

663
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,330
I was promised gambling.

664
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,070
How do I get there?

665
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:38,890
I just climb over it.

666
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,510
It says do not enter.

667
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:41,810
Where the fuck?

668
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,390
Where do I gamble?

669
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,950
Where is my illegal gambling ring?

670
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,990
If I was a gambling ring.

671
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:49,790
Oh, is that the door?

672
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,410
through this door.

673
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,290
If I was an illegal gambling ring, where would I be?

674
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,790
Where the fuck is it?

675
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,370
Wait, I hear them.

676
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,390
They're inside.

677
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,790
He said, I'll talk to you later.

678
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:11,430
How do I get in?

679
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,150
Knock, knock.

680
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,550
I want to gamble.

681
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:19,610
Hello?

682
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:20,250

Well, at least I got a boat.

685
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:02,810
I can't believe it.

686
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,270
I ain't even poor in this game.

687
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,130
I found a million dollars at the massage party.

688
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,810
All right, let me fucking turn down the goddamn radio.

689
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,010
It's so loud.

690
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,230
Holy shit.

691
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,670
Was the radio this loud the entire time?

692
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:20,690
That shit is loud.

693
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,650
I'll go down a little bit more.

694
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,510
All right.

695
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,080
Okay, I gotta figure out where to go.

696
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,410
And dock here.

697
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:44,990
Whoa!

698
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:46,630
I parked it.

699
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:47,910
Now no...

700
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:48,530
Look at that.

701
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,190
Good parking for me.

702
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:53,490
Oh, now there's...

703
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:58,350
Oh, what the fuck after I leave the deck postponed in?

704
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:00,690
Okay.

705
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,590
I can't believe it.

706
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,870
Now they spawned in.

707
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:03,190
Alright.

708
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,330
Wait, what if I call Tiffany?

709
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,030
That's Trent.

710
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:10,550
Hey, wait.

711
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:11,450
I need your help.

712
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,350
Where the fuck do I find Tiffany?

713
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,950
I thought she called me.

714
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,970
She texted me asking me for help.

715
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,630
Okay, let's see.

716
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,930
Where's my other lady?

717
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,060
Oh, I have to do not ping first?

718
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:40,800
Alright.

719
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,420
I'm complaining.

720
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,200
Let's go.

721
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,320
Okay, but before we do that, sorry.

722
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,300
This is much more important.

723
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,440
Sorry, ping.

724
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,680
I'll be there.

725
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,440
Don't worry.

726
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,700
Don't worry, ping.

727
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,780
I'll be there.

728
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:00,680
But this is...

729
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,420
Oh, hey, nice.

730
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:02,700
This is actually pretty important.

731
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:03,560
Nice.

732
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,260
We actually need this.

733
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:14,280
Oh Oh, they're too far Is that how you pronounce it?

734
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,800
I remember it.

735
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:30,620
I remember that quote from From all the uh From all the uh shun-hum-hum Deng si cat Is that how you pronounce it?

736
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, oh they're too far?

737
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,380
How do you pronounce it?

738
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,980
That's it's like a for the monks.

739
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,460
Unless I'm pronouncing it terribly wrong.

740
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,220
But I know that quote from all the Wukon TV shows.

741
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,320
Oh, ne, Tofa.

742
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,810
How the fuck do I?

743
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:58,730
Oh, my gosh.

744
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:00,150
I'm sorry.

745
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:04,130
The cock fighting will have to be another day.

746
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,030
I'm sorry, guys.

747
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,410
I know we want to see those cocks fight.

748
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:12,450
The roosters!

749
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,370
We want to see the roosters fight!

750
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,990
I'm sorry, guys.

751
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:22,710
We can't see them fight, guys.

752
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,790
Alright, can you take me to the area?

753
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,010
Alright, hire taxis.

754
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:32,730

755
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:33,570
Where's the closest?

756
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:36,690
Alright, take me to this clothing store.

Better get rid of that cop somehow.

762
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,100
Oh.

763
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,420
How do we get rid of her?

764
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,760
Distract the cop?

765
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:26,200
How?

766
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,560
By talking to him?

767
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,560
Having a nice conversation?

768
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,820
Excuse me.

769
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,260
Officer?

Yes.

771
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,900
What is it?

772
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,760
Yeah, I saw what looked like a drug deal a couple minutes ago.

773
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:36,860
Oh, by lying.

774
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,380
I'll check it out.

775
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,180
I mean, I could just do that.

776
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,160
I could just tell a cop, like...

777
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,200
Fake tip?

778
01:07:45,340 --> 01:08:17,480

779
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,040
Info 4, it's an actual real drug deal.

780
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,150
Oh, that's easy.

781
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,910
What was the invalid placement?

782
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:32,570
Okay.

783
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,320
Oh, nice.

784
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,080
Oh, this hacking is so easy.

785
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,720
How do you know how to do that?

786
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,620
I have my ways.

787
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,340
I learned it in the streets.

788
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:48,640
Girl.

789
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,800
I almost called her bitch, but I think we're not.

790
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,880
It's just the first day.

791
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,660
I shouldn't see that.

792
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,020
So, that I'll do that on the second date.

793
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,520
That's reserved for second dates, guys.

794
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,780
It's all sorts of crazy shit.

795
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,280
I bet.

796
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,540
You know, I still don't know your name.

797
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,200
I'm a gentleman.

798
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,040
Well, look at my address book.

799
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,100
You're still just not pinged to me.

800
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,940
That's cute.

801
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,460
I like that.

802
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,160
So you want to set me straight?

803
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,140
Most likely.

804
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:22,900
Oh!

805
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,440
I guess we'll see what it is.

806
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,340
Turned me straight.

807
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,320
That's what it means, right?

808
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:31,900
Yeah?

809
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,360
You're going to show me how to hide the camera?

810
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,340
That's what it means, right?

811
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,060
That quote?

812
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,700
Wait, where's not ping?

813
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,060
Are you ping?

814
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,260
What happened to not ping?

815
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,120
Where did she go?

816
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,120
I want not ping.

817
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,240
Alright.

818
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,380
Let's see.

819
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,760
Do you hear that 7-11 all the time?

820
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,220
The peep-peep.

I really need your help, please.

896
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:44,980
What's wrong?

897
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:46,960
It's...

898
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,580
It's this...

899
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,020
A gun.

900
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,420
Why do you have a gun?

901
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,320
Charlie made me carry it in my purse for him.

902
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,780
That's very illegal in Hong Kong.

903
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,600
And now he's gone, and I don't know what to do with it.

904
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,260
Charlie.

905
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,260
He's one of Dog Eyes people, right?

906
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,460
Yes, and you took over, right?

907
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,640
So in a way, the gun is yours, too.

908
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,520
You'll take it, won't you?

909
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,920
Sure, I'll take it.

910
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:11,820
That's it?

911
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:13,920
That's a big problem.

912
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,860
Yes, thank you so much, Wei.

913
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,720
Oh, shit, free gun!

914
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,040
Oh, God, with my gun!

915
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,680
Look, this is modern era.

916
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:30,160
Yeah, sticks don't work as well as a gun, guys.

917
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,820
A long stick doesn't work as well as a gun.

918
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,420
Hello?

919
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:37,260

The Glock to an RPG or the shotgun.

01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,600
And they could turn into a fucking sniper rifle.

924
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,660
And then like...

925
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,620
And then...

926
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:57,140
See Fule, the monk can be like a police officer.

927
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,060
And he's like...

928
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,140
Like Wukong would be like from the...

929
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,100
Like from the triads or some shit.

930
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,300

931
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:09,540
Um, the, the monk can be like, don't worry, I can fix him.

932
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:20,100
He's a, he's a police officer, and he's here to, he's here to, and then, like, oh my god, it's literally sleeping dogs.

933
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,960
It's, you think about it.

934
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,360
And Wukong becomes like an undercover cop.

935
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,140
Wait, wrong direction.

936
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:36,150
Okay.

937
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,520

Alright.

941
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,060
Alright, here you go.

942
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,110
Just film playing this game.

943
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,890
Pitch a TV show.

944
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:08,390
Andrew?

945
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:09,790
What are you doing here?

946
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:10,450
Where's Raymond?

947
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,570
This is something I wanted to handle personally.

948
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:14,670
Do you have Charlie Pang's gun?

949
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:21,570
Andrew seems seems like a corrupt cop They're always yeah, that's what I'm saying.

950
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,750
I was like how does he have a gun in Hong Kong?

951
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:25,690
Who's the dead guy?

952

Okay, you ready Yeah, too.

954
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,700
Why use gun when I have when I have the wall?

955

Oh shit Oh.

956
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:51,140
Flashbang.

957
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,280
We'll have to recreate the fight.

958
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:54,620
What?

959
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,220
In my head?

960
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,960
Just remember back then.

961
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:06,160
Shouldn't be able to know how I had a gun already?

962
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,740
Recreate the fight in your head.

963
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,800
First he was in cover behind the barricade.

964
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:19,580
How?

965
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,260
It didn't teach me!

966
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,120
Where are the guns?

967
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,660

I want you to put some bullets in a few things.

970
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,900
Like the TV?

971
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,040
Um, guns are for shooting people.

972
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,580
Not for items.

973
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:34,880
That's a waste of bullets.

974
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,380
Fire shots using blind fire?

975
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,200

What the fuck?

996
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,720
There's a game based off of that Pop pop pop.

997
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:47,920
Oh, I hit him

998
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:53,980
Oh shit.

999
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,520
Oh, you want me to bump wait.

1000
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,900
That's the actual game mechanic for Whoops.

1001
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,700
Max speed, yeah.

1002
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,080
Okay, I'll...

1003
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,820
Keep going.

1004
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,340
Come on.

1005
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,720
I'm trying my best, sir!

1006
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,700
Okay, I did it.

1007
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,400
Wait, he's still alive.

1008
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,240
He would have tried to get away.

1009
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,120
Oh, Conway.

1010
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,100
But Charlie disabled the car.

1011
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:25,500
Who's Charlie?

1012
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:26,760
Oh, me.

1013
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,320
Oh, shit.

1014
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,700
My food's here.

1015
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,420
Your weapon, officer.

1016
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,780
Good firing way.

1017
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,220
My pre-cooked meals.

1018
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,240
Pendule!

1019
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,520
What are you doing?

1020
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,540
I told you he wasn't important.

1021
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:44,660
Now he is.

1022
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,200
He's going to help us nail Charlie Pang.

1023
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:48,820
Wait, that was real?

1024
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,300
It wasn't in my head?

1025
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,600
I don't think I do, sir.

1026
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,820
Way, I know who you are.

1027
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,280
You're just like me.

1028
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,720
You do what must be done.

1029
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,400
I thought this was all make-believe in my head.

1030
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,620
Where did this guy come from?

1031
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,000
What?

1032
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,340
Jacob, I told you.

1033
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,340
It's classic Hong Kong movies.

1034
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,400
The head police guy is always the corrupt cop.

1035
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,120
It's such a classic.

1036
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,440
Okay, we don't need... I don't need to shoot my gun.

1037
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,800
Action, hijack, increased ramming damage.

1038
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,740
It's always, oh, yeah, it's always the British guy, too.

1039
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:44,460
Just like Rushad.

1040
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,800
The British guy is the bad guy.

1041
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,460
Rice, thank you for the super chat.

1042
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,520
Thank you, thank you.

1043
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,280
Do I want to?

1044
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,240
Do I, should I go all in on cars?

1045
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,580
I don't, I feel like the guns are not that interesting.

1046
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,140
I don't go in the cars.

1047
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:01,720
Cars are cool.

1048
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:04,860
Hong Kong opera is my favorite kind of opera.

1049
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,760
Uh, anyways, thank you for the super chat.

1050
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:07,100
Thank you.

1051
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:07,800
Thank you.

1052
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:08,300
Thank you.

1053
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:09,340
How?

1054
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:10,020
What?

1055
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,880
I was literally there for a cop job.

1056
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,480
We got to lose the cops.

1057
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,000
Don't worry.

1058
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:32,840
I did it.

1059
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,180
I lost them.

1060
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,760
We just found out that Mrs. Chu's restaurant got hit.

1061
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,740
Not Mrs. Chu!

1062
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:44,820
Witnesses.

1063
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,620
Where are the witnesses?

1064
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,180
Where are they?

1065
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,700
Oh, shit.

1066
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,560
I had to go back to...

1067
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,040
Oh, red-handed Tiffany?

1068
01:24:58,620 --> 01:24:59,440
Red-handed...

1069
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,260
Wait, what?

1070
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,280
What?

1071
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:03,340
Wait, wait.

1072
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,440
I gotta talk to Tiffany.

1073
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,260
We were to say tip on hot shots, whereabouts.

1074
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,360
I parked the truck nearby so he can bug his car and tell him.

1075
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:10,820
Okay, I'll be there real quick.

1076
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,840
I gotta talk to Tiffany.

1077
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,380
I gotta talk to my second girlfriend.

1078
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,040
Give me a sec.

1079
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:21,980
Tiffany!

1080
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,300
Wait, that's not Tiffany.

1081
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,000
Who's that?

1082
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,480
Where's Tiffany?

1083
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,000
What's up?

1084
01:25:37,320 --> 01:26:08,340

1085
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,320
She's not like Emma Stone!

1086
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,200
No!

1087
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,320
She would never do this to me!

1088
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:23,380
We had something special!

1089
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,800
We karaokeed!

1090
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:32,740
There's no way, there's no way, no way.

1091
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,140
She might just be a really good friend of hers.

1092
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,300
Maybe a family member.

1093
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,320
How dare my second girlfriend not be loyal

1094
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:54,740
Well, rules for the but not for me

1095
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:13,060
There's this one right here Got a twist Don't worry, as a good boyfriend, I'm gonna bug her phone

1096
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:29,580
Sugar lips?

1097
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,240
You know I am.

1098
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,400
I don't know.

1099
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,600
I can't wait to see you again.

1100
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:35,600
How about tonight?

1101
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:36,940
I can't, baby.

1102
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,780
I have to work late.

1103
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:39,720
You sure?

1104
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,220
I'd love to, baby.

1105
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,600
You know I can't wait to taste you again.

1106
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,080
But it'll happen next week.

1107
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,860
If you say so, I'll call you.

1108
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,340
But she calls me.

1109
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,140
She said...

1110
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:57,120
She said I was her only baby.

1111
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:03,120
God damn, Tiffany, you were...

1112
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:08,300
My second girlfriend.

1113
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:16,800
I can't believe it.

1114
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,240
We held heads.

1115
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:25,420
Does that mean nothing?

1116
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:30,650
We even held hands.

1117
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:34,870
I can't believe it.

1118
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:37,570
I'm going to tell my third girlfriend about that.

1119
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,790
She's four on our streets.

1120
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:43,430
I can't believe it.

1121
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:47,310
And then keep one word.

1122
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:49,990
His food.

1123
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:52,290
What does she mean by that?

1124
01:28:54,090 --> 01:29:10,390
I got me an AMD's never sell burner that came with two And I got for crossfire purposes Thanks for paying the still keep brought back some happy memories Thank you for the super chat Thank you, thank you, I appreciate it And she means the food, right?

1125
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:21,210
I can't believe it And then she misses kisses Because she's like I miss the taste She meant kisses, right?

1126
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:26,910
Because that's what we Dude, we got the homerun and we kissed.

1127
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:30,710
Can't believe she would kiss another man.

1128
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:32,410
You find out?

1129
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:33,950
Surely.

1130
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:38,770
Can't believe it.

1131
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:42,430
Wait for Tiffany.

1132
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:43,530
I'll show her.

1133
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:46,510
I'll show her what she's missing.

1134
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:49,290
Is it because of the Wukon?

1135
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:51,010
The ass outfit?

1136
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,470
Tiffany.

1137
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:55,890
I told you, I'm his number one fan!

1138
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:02,410
If you can't love me in my Wukon era, you don't deserve me.

1139
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:09,490
Ever since I went Wukon, I can't believe I will never change.

1140
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:13,670
No, it can't be the gambling.

1141
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:14,910
It must be the Wukon.

1142
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:16,650
There's no way.

1143
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:19,770
I got rid of a gun for her and everything.

1144
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,280
Ladies love this outfit.

1145
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:31,040
The Wukon elf.

1146
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,870
Is it because it stayed on?

1147
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:38,480
Jesus Christ.

1148
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,080
Yeah, that's not...

1149
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:43,120
I'm not possessive.

1150
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:43,920
Guys.

1151
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,840
She's the whore.

1152
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,420
Wait, this is...

1153
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,680
This is just...

1154
01:30:55,700 --> 01:31:10,340
justified she cheated I am allowed to do this she cheated so I am allowed to stalk her

1155
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:20,320
whoa Toki said come but I'm not possessive Toki said calmly

1156
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,800
Socking.

1157
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,700
If she didn't cheat, I wouldn't be doing this.

1158
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,720
My parents social.

1159
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:35,500
Oh, she.

1160
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:42,180
All right, here we go.

1161
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:48,300
But Tiffany would have put our journey to the West together.

1162
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:54,940
Who is he?

1163
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:56,240
No!

1164
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,760
How dare you!

1165
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,240
No!

1166
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,800
How dare you!

1167
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,340
Oh shit!

1168
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,060
Sorry, wrong person.

1169
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:12,640
Sorry.

1170
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,380
Wayshend, motherfucker, who are you?

1171
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,900
Oh, so the big triad gangster is mad now?

1172
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:22,780
Only the big triad gangster can sleep with other people?

1173
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:25,340

Oh my god, there we go.

1204
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:09,300
I knew it When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

1205
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,480
Hello, third girlfriend.

1206
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,000
Check under the hood.

1207
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,420
Wait, oh my god!

1208
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:25,320

After everything I did!

1210
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:30,620
Oh, it's just that...

1211
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:31,920
Oh my gosh, I should have just grabbed the car.

1212
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,100
I should...

1213
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,720
I should have grabbed the car.

1214
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,740
and just fucking ran him over.

1215
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:38,760
I dated.

1216
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,780
I kept...

1217
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,680

1218
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,160
That's so sad.

1219
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,200
Holy fuck.

1220
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,480
He just tripped on a box.

1221
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:03,300
He tripped on a box and just died.

1222
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,760

1224
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:40,480
I thought we had something when we sang that song.

1225
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:46,160
You dragged a guy across a bridge and broke his throat up for a thousand five.

1226
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,740
Look, I had a broken heart.

1227
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:54,740
I needed something to fix it.

1228
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,040
And I know.

1229
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,660
And I know what to do.

1230
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,840
I got my coupon.

1231
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:09,660
Yeah, they're coming.

1232
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,280
Guys, is it actually possible to even keep Tiffany?

1233
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,580
If I didn't cheat on her?

1234
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,720
Was it possible?

1235
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,360
If I didn't get...

1236
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,820
Oh, what happened to my car?

1237
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,500
My...

1238
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,940
My game, like...

1239
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,540
I wouldn't...

1240
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:32,240
No?

1241
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,680
It was scripted!

1242
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:39,220
The game won't let me have three girlfriends?

1243
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:41,300
I can't believe it.

1244
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,180
Oh my god.

1245
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,080
What is wrong with my controller?

1246
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,860
I can't believe it.

1247
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,080
It was canon.

1248
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:51,020
We were just never meant to be.

1249
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:54,240
No.

1250
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:58,540
It was just never meant to be.

1251
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,080
I can't believe it.

1252
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:04,600
I'm so sad.

1253
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,100
Now I have two girlfriends.

1254
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,360
She loves me.

1255
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,960
Is it because of the Wukon?

1256
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,040
These girls liked it.

1257
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,700
These girls love the Wukon outfit.

1258
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:30,720
I need four more massages and then I get an extra free one on my coupon.

1259
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:35,660
I heard, oh wait, it's double stamp Wednesday too.

1260
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:37,760
It's Double Stamp Wednesday.

1261
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,080
That was wonderful.

1262
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:40,800
I got two stamps for that.

1263
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,600
Don't worry.

1264
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:44,000
I'm a VIP.

1265
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:47,660
Massage parlor.

1266
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:49,280
Massage the pain away.

1267
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:52,840
Don't worry.

1268
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:55,660
The massage parlor will massage it away.

1269
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,880
She knows my name, guys.

1270
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,520
I am a VIP.

1271
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,480
What the fuck's going on?

1272
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,660
Dog eyes shut up, Winston.

1273
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:06,960
This mother's restaurant tonight.

1274
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,780
Do you say who they are?

1275
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,100
What's that just heard?

1276
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:13,860
Your mother?

1277
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:15,680
She's fine.

1278
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,120
But two of our people were killed.

1279
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:20,040
And a couple customers were wounded.

1280
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:21,760
The police are there now.

1281
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,420
Oh shit, I don't think the restaurant's gonna be okay after that.

1282
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:27,160
I just heard five.

1283
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:28,820
Listen up!

1284
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:30,640
I didn't hear five.

1285
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,780
All his drugs boosted that place.

1286
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,080
It's how he makes his money.

Hello?

1295
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,020
Is Tiffany here?

1296
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,160
Lauren.

1297
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,920
Oh, that's the first song I sang with Tiffany.

1298
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:10,780
Stop singing!

1299
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,760
That's right.

1300
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:17,780
Stop singing.

1301
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:25,500
That was our first song together.

1302
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:28,480
Kind of cringe though.

1303
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,880
Broke up with me.

1304
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:56,240
Nobody can sing If I can't sing with Tiffany anymore No one can sing You're good with your hands, Shan Let's see what you can do without iron Look, hold up We shouldn't go in shooting anymore There'll be workers in there And we need to while alive Yeah Oh,

01:41:56,380 --> 01:42:08,760
we're going in shooting This is dog eyes biggest moneymaker They're not gonna give it up without a fight But you want me unarmed You're the new guy Inside find your own gun when and use it.

1306
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:09,760
Why am I an arm?

1307
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,500
Believe me you better have some bodies on you.

1308
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:12,840
I'm right.

1309
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:26,920
I'm the one that's supposed to like fucking get him alive But you're not a cop As far as I'm concerned There's only one test that matters Killing people you want to kill one of dog eyes drug dealers to prove it?

1310
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:31,540
All right It'll be my you mean the 20 other people I killed didn't count?

1311
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:38,160
But yeah, I know if you're an Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh my god, I have to follow it.

1312
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,220
We gotta know if you're an actual real cop because we want to kill a bad guy.

1313
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:47,380
So I'm like, what, the 20 innocent people I killed didn't count?

1314
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,400
You wait for my signal to attack.

1315
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:53,640
If I kill a bad person, shouldn't that be the one that counts the most?

1316
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:55,340
That counts the least?

1317
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,060
To being cops?

1318
01:42:59,340 --> 01:42:59,420
You've

1319
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:05,490
seen the new KVS?

1320
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:06,170
The old ones?

1321
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:06,770
Dealers.

1322
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:08,070
Thinking the getting one?

1323
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:08,530
Oh my god.

1324
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:09,570
Are what, dog eyes, please?

1325
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:10,070
You will, oh.

1326
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,910
Oh, okay.

1327
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:15,190
All right.

1328
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:16,530
Sail onto the wall!

1329
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:18,570
That's sucking right.

1330
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:20,010
Journey.

1331
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:21,070
Oh, shit.

1332
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:22,430
Wait.

1333
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:23,190
Give me a sec.

1334
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:23,870
Oh, wait.

1335
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,530
Wait.

1336
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:27,570
It's moving day!

1337
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,310
Delivery for pain!

1338
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:35,810
All right.

1339
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:36,250
Nice.

1340
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:37,470
All right.

1341
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:38,230
There's no more.

1342
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:40,170
Let's just put you against the wall.

1343
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:42,850
A good one, Doki.

1344
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:46,290
There you go.

1345
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:48,110
Turning to the wall.

1346
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:51,530
All right.

1347
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:55,510
Hello.

1348
01:43:58,230 --> 01:43:59,190
That's looking right.

1349
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:01,130
Oh, shit!

1350
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:03,490

1351
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:05,310
What do you mean?

1352
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:09,290
Avoid grapplers.

1353
01:44:09,730 --> 01:44:11,930
They have Ramblers in here?

1354
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:13,330
Alright.

1355
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:17,530

01:44:22,030 --> 01:44:22,850
Alright, let's just punch him.

1358
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:24,470
Because I can't put him against that wall.

1359
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:25,130
JK!

1360
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:26,650

1361
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:29,150
Alright.

1362
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:31,310
I counted him.

1363
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:34,310

1364
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:36,650

1365
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:37,970

01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:40,390

01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:45,050

1368
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:46,430
What the fuck?

1369
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:49,730

01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:57,730
Don't touch the metal.

01:44:58,230 --> 01:44:58,750
It's high.

1374
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:04,550
That's right.

1375
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,320

1386
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,340

1387
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,200
Who ordered the Tatsu?

1390
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,260
Let's go.

1391
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,320
I did give me three boxes.

1392
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:28,630
Serpentine!

1393
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:30,210
That's fucking right.

1394
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:31,930
Get this gun out of here.

1395
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:33,910
I don't need no gun.

1396
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:35,430
Get this gun out of here.

1397
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:37,830
Get this gun out of here.

1398
01:46:38,110 --> 01:46:38,770
How do I just...

1399
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:40,950
Okay, I don't need no gun.

1400
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,730
All I need is the environment.

1401
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,190
Oh shit, maybe I should have brought the gun.

1402
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:55,110
Oh wait, there's the gun.

1403
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:05,360
There you go.

1404
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:09,980
Okay, I got it.

1405
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:10,920
I got reloaded.

1406
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:11,640
There you go.

1407
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:18,730
But I got...

1408
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:20,850
Oh, that did nothing.

1409
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:22,870
Okay, I'm gonna vault over.

1410
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,810
I need to get there closer.

1411
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:30,010
There you go.

1412
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,260
Slow-mo!

1413
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:37,660
Oh, man!

1414
01:47:42,370 --> 01:47:44,410
That's what I could have used it for.

1415
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:46,690
Okay, that is not cover.

1416
01:47:47,290 --> 01:47:49,090
That is absolutely not cover.

1417
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:54,510
That guy stood in front of, like...

1418
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:55,930
Like, stood behind?

1419
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,030
I don't know.

1420
01:47:57,130 --> 01:47:58,470
This guy's fucking stupid.

1421
01:47:58,530 --> 01:47:59,230
That's for sure.

1422
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:02,290
That's actually natural selection right there.

1423
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:06,030
I don't know.

1424
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:07,090
I'll get rid of this.

1425
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,800
God, I hate shooting with a controller.

1426
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:17,880
There we go.

1427
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:19,220
Easy.

1428
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,340
Wait, who's still alive?

1429
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,060
Oh my god, wait, you're still alive?

1430
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:25,380
This is not an overkill.

1431
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,420
He deserves it.

1432
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:27,580
Oh, shit.

1433
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,780
Alright, up the stairs again.

1434
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,880
Up the stairs, I'll go.

1435
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,360
Oh, I thought he was alive.

1436
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:37,660
I was like, holy shit.

1437
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,560

1442
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:15,260
Guys, do you think I got him?

1443
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:16,160

01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:35,240
Beats, mouse, and keyboard yet again.

1451
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,640
He has to come down, right?

1452
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:46,720
What?

1453
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,640
How the fuck did I not?

1454
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,400
Oh, my God, it's scripted.

1455
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,980
It's fucking scripted.

1456
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:58,420

01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:07,780
That's fucking right.

1461
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:10,820

1463
01:50:17,990 --> 01:50:18,890

01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:35,870
Don't move.

1472
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:37,430

1475
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:44,960
Wait, where is he?

1476
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,000
I could just do that.

1477
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:48,960
Steal a cop.

1478
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:49,700
Steal.

1479
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,540

01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,500
Oh my god.

1481
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:55,580
Maybe these cops.

1482
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:56,720
Oh, no, they're mine.

1483
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:57,180
There they are.

1484
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,640
I was gonna say, am I just allowed to steal?

1485
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:02,300
Steal this?

1486
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:03,980
Like, what happened?

1487
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:10,480

01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,060

1490
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:20,720
There we go.

1491
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:22,440
That's right.

1492
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:24,080
Get out!

1493
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,580

01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,340
I gotta bring him to Bus Depot.

1505
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,320
What did I do?

1506
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,360
I'm not afraid of dog eyes.

1507
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:03,200
Dog eyes?

1508
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,860

01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:09,400
What the fuck did the other people do?

1530
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:12,800
They said they had guns, but who did they shoot?

1531
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:14,180
A little token to my respect.

1532
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,340
Oh my god.

1533
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,060

1549
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,020
They'll never know I'm from the triad.

1550
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:31,860
Surely they'll never know I'm a cop with that.

1551
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:38,320
I gotta get that tactical uniform so they'll never know I'm a cop.

Oh, he died.

01:56:34,350 --> 01:56:38,540
I wasn't supposed to kill him.

1570
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,880
He just said take him away and I saw him being raided.

1571
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,680
He's in hell now.

1572
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,400
Stop scaring the customers.

1573
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:51,800

That's a teenage boy.

1576
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,220
That's not even a grandma.

1577
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,140
That's a teenage boy, sir.

1578
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:14,680
You're so drunk.

1579
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:19,040
Alright, now that the event is over.

01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:22,120

1582
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,080
Inhale!

1583
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:27,180
Oh, wait.

1584
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,180
Give me a sec.

1585
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:29,440
There we go.

1586
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,880
Now I can do this.

1587
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,240
Now he can go to hell.

1588
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:39,400
Exactly.

1589
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:43,940
Wait, where is it?

1590
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,460
No, I just get experience for that one.

1591
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:49,500
I was gonna say, like, does a...

1592
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:49,680

1593
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,700
All right, that's a fast car.

1594
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:51,680
Give me your car.

1595
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:58,600
Yeah, yeah, I left him near the...

1596
01:57:58,600 --> 01:57:58,900
Exactly.

1597
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:00,960
Wait, excuse me?

1598
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:02,360
All right.

1599
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,760
Don't mess with you.

1600
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:05,980
Oh, you're a gangster?

1601
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:07,080
Yeah?

1602
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:09,120
Yeah?

1603
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,320
Don't start with me.

1604
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:15,700
Okay, I need to charge this up.

1605
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:16,660
All right.

1606
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,280
I'm practically a gangster.

1607
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:23,820
I think this guy peed in his pants.

1608
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:25,920
There we go.

1609
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:27,440
Yeah, don't mess with you.

1610
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:28,780
Say that again.

1611
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,600
That's fucking right.

1612
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,500
Don't mess with Soon Wukon.

1613
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:36,780
You think you're bad?

1614
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:39,860
That's fucking right.

1615
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:44,120
Don't show your face in this neighborhood again.

1616
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:50,020
I'm not teaching him a lesson.

1617
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:51,280
He'll never respect me.

1618
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,180
All right, I got it this way.

1619
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:03,500
As long as we follow traffic laws, the cops will never get me.

1620
01:59:07,010 --> 01:59:09,970
All right, what's the next mission?

1621
01:59:14,930 --> 01:59:15,410
Weeeee!

1622
01:59:15,930 --> 01:59:16,390
Cinema.

1623
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:18,710
All right, hello.

1624
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:21,670
Wait, I got- don't you have a mission for me?

1625
01:59:21,730 --> 01:59:22,310
Come back!

1626
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:23,650
Come back!

1627
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:24,230
Okay.

1628
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:25,570
Okay.

1629
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:28,510
I thought you have a mission!

1630
01:59:28,970 --> 01:59:30,110
Give me a mission!

1631
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:33,950
He's like, take the van!

1632
01:59:37,010 --> 01:59:38,050
Just leave!

1633
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:42,930
Don, whoop.

1634
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:45,130
You're about those traffic laws.

1635
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:49,210
Look, every time you jump out of a car, you just gotta shoot your gun.

1636
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:50,670
It's traffic 101.

1637
01:59:52,670 --> 01:59:53,390
What did I do?

1638
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:54,470
Why did he run away?

1639
01:59:57,570 --> 02:00:04,690
I don't know about you, if you guys have a gun and you're jumping out of a moving vehicle, you gotta do it.

1640
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:08,310
It's literally the first law in traffic.

1641
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:16,470
As a viewer, I can confirm that is indeed in the park, in the driver's test.

1642
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:21,250
Yeah, if you have a license, you know that.

1643
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:23,630
Ooh, someone doesn't have a license there.

1644
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:34,530
Not in a bug under Hotshot's car.

1645
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:36,130
Oh, it's over here.

1646
02:00:37,890 --> 02:00:39,190
I don't think they'll know.

1647
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:42,750
I'm just fixing his car.

1648
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:47,610
Yeah, it's literally in like...

1649
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:49,970
It's like the first question in the driver's test.

1650
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:55,490
And then when you park your car, it's like what you have to do before you park your car.

1651
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:02,060
Okay.

1652
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:04,900
Oh.

1653
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:07,300
Where is this?

1654
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,000
There it is.

1655
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,500
This one's the annoying part.

1656
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,640
The two, well you have to twist two of them.

1657
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,800
Back in the city van.

1658
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,900
Yeah, we need a time to swap off the...

1659
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:21,380
You're right.

1660
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:23,440
I was like, wait, that's not my Wukon outfit.

1661
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:25,380
I don't understand.

1662
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:27,220
Is my Wukon outfit that suspicious?

1663
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:34,420
Yeah, it's not that suspicious, is it?

1664
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:34,960
No.

1665
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:48,910
You won't know.

1666
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:50,550
I'm also just parked up.

1667
02:01:54,510 --> 02:01:56,450
I'm just a little too close.

1668
02:01:57,790 --> 02:01:58,490
Don't worry, if I'm free.

1669
02:01:59,070 --> 02:02:00,410
I gotta be further back.

1670
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:02,190
I blend right in.

1671
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,360
You think he's a rat?

1672
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:13,240
Or on the

1673
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:18,560
go away?

1674
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,780
So now he's in trouble if he is.

1675
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:22,420
I mean, in game, what do I care?

1676
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:26,160
But if I was you, I wouldn't let him see you do anything and walk away.

1677
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:57,500
actually that is really bad like cop being a cop like just um just just like uh doing a raid on every bad thing that i'm at like that's a little stupid isn't it that's pretty suspicious you're supposed to like you're supposed to like what's the word like uh What's the word?

1678
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:58,860
Like, paste it out?

1679
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:01,700
Like, call him.

1680
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:02,780
Oh, I already...

1681
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:06,390
Yes, sir.

1682
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:07,270
Inspector, it's way.

1683
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:09,050
Hachat's gonna raise ace.

1684
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:10,430
And he's talking like he's not...

1685
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:11,730
Yeah, we gotta be low key.

1686
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:14,570
Yeah, gotta be this streak.

1687
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:17,750
I... Like, we should, like, paste the arrest and stuff.

1688
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:21,290
Not, like, arrest stuff people back to back.

1689
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:23,110
He's an informant for HKPD.

1690
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:25,550
He's the one that put us on to Hachat in the first place.

1691
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:28,130
You should, like, stagger the arrest.

1692
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:31,910
You don't arrest every bad person that I'm with.

1693
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:33,190
But not if it gets me killed.

1694
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:35,330
Do everything you can to keep my cover intact.

1695
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:36,710
I'll deal with Nas myself.

1696
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:37,190
Alright.

1697
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:38,290
Wait, alright.

1698
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:40,830
And also let me kill more people.

1699
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:47,570
Because they'll be like, there's no way a cop would kill 50 people.

1700
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:49,210
That's fucked.

1701
02:03:49,330 --> 02:03:50,650
50 innocent people.

1702
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:52,890
I should be allowed to kill 50 innocent people.

1703
02:03:54,110 --> 02:03:56,230
Just to prove to them that I'm not a cop.

1704
02:03:58,250 --> 02:04:01,190
Because I'd be like, that's fucking crazy.

1705
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:06,290
One innocent person is already fucked up.

1706
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:09,450
Wait, how do I drive backwards?

1707
02:04:10,110 --> 02:04:11,030
Wait, why?

1708
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:12,830
Why stop after?

1709
02:04:12,930 --> 02:04:14,630
That's just a benchmark, you know?

1710
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:18,190
I'd be like, yeah, that guy's definitely not a cop.

1711
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:33,180
Yeah, I'm wearing a mask.

1712
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,160
You won't know it's me.

1713
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:35,720
Yay!

1714
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:37,260
I did it.

1715
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:40,960
Yeah, for day one.

1716
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:43,580
For one day.

1717
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,380
I should be allowed to kill X amount of people to prove it.

1718
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:51,640
To, like, you know, not blow my cover, you know?

1719
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:54,480
I'm trying to not blow my cover.

1720
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,340
Oh, that's the racing one.

1721
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,540
That's an enemy?

1722
02:04:57,640 --> 02:04:59,100
I'm going to beat that guy up.

1723
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,220
Where is that guy?

1724
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,860
There's apparently an enemy right here.

1725
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:10,960
Oh, that's a lot.

1726
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,220
Wait, there's money over here.

1727
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:13,900
That's fine.

1728
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,300
That's fine.

1729
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:18,500
I got a wall here.

1730
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:23,720
It's fine.

1731
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:24,700
I got my wall.

1732
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,080
This is my chosen wall.

1733
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:29,100
Journey to the wall.

1734
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:30,300
There you go.

1735
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,260
I did it.

1736
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:33,580
And I got money, too.

1737
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:35,660
Yay, everyone.

1738
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:38,460
What's your weapon of choice?

1739
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:40,220
Wall.

1740
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:41,140
