1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Just got your fugies up and I was like, that's all I need.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:02,920
All right.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,260
We're live.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,080
I'm live now, too.

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,980
Now we're all live.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:09,800
Oh, yeah.

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,660
Let me inform my chat real quick what I just said to them
like five minutes ago because I wasn't live.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,120
So for those who are wondering why I didn't start at 4.30,
um, it's because Altair wanted to talk to his chat and Beto

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,220
forgot what time it was.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:32,300
So he copied Altair's homework, but then I was like, Guys,
we're starting at five, guys.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,060
So that's why they were 30 minutes early because Beto forgot
what time it was and he copied the wrong homework.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,060
Wait, wait, wait, you weren't talking to your chat 30
minutes early?

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,720
No, I actually pushed it 30 minutes because I'm like, oh,
wait, I have more time.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,340
I was like, you didn't want to talk to your chat, Beto.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:51,900
That's fucked up.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,060
And then I joined 120 seconds late.

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,380
So it was really just a beautiful song and dance I did
today.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,320
We're starting off strong here.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,820

Baked potato.

I'm like, dude, I am not a part of this shit.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
I am a complete third party.

45
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,180
I'm not.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,740
I don't care.

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,080
I'm just trying to get some scraps.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm just like, are you new, brother?

So we're like, we're like rogues.

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,520
We're like rogues, like the outsiders then.

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,280
Yeah.

53
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,220
We're the non-affiliates called in war.

54
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,920
We're like mercenaries.

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,900
Oh, civilians?

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah, we're this.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
We're civilians.

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,360
We're just civilians in a civil war.

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,220
Yeah, a bunch of marauders in this war.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,640
Are there any colors that we have to avoid?

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,540
Yeah, what colors are we?

62
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh, I don't know them at all.

63
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,640
I sure hope it's not white and orange.

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,300
Okay, it's fine.

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,920
It's fine.

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,920
Everything is fine.

67
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,800
Oh, they're like, would you like to update your graphics
card?

68
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,400
I was like, no.

69
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,360
Or your graphics driver.

70
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,900
Will you update it your driver?

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
You just believe them just like that.

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,160
Like, Doki, I'm a firm believer of NVIDIA, okay?

73
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,640
They just do whatever they want.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,860
They can take my bios.

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,040
They can take my kernel, whatever they want.

76
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,120
They can pop it.

77
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,580
Damn.

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,600
Pop it.

79
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,260
Damn, you're so naive.

80
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,640
Did you guys start tutorial, by the way?

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,000

82
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,560
I'm level five.

83
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,900
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,300
Wait, you're level five?

85
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,840
Yeah, I did.

86
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,960
Actually, I didn't know there was a tutorial.

87
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,580
I thought.

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,760
I'll leave the tutorial to do.

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,260
You didn't even have it downloaded, Doki.

90
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,640
Come on.

91
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,840
No, I was so tired.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Oh, guys, no, you got to understand.

93
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,780

98
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,160
That's why I forgot to download Arc Raiders.

99
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,840

I'm so fucking tired, bro.

112

Like, you know, like in competitive shooters, you got to
like think on the go and everything.

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh, yeah.

swapped like what they're playing in every fucking time.

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,600
And I'm so tired.

117
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,520
All the FOMO of not playing Marvel rifles.

118
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,360
It's really hitting.

119
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,720
And that's why I play one character.

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,500
Yeah, and that's why you get Target banned.

Okay, the first, if I hear, okay, I'll have a quota.

If I hear five gamer words in this stream, I will turn it

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,460
That's the quota.

I've been seeing a lot of that.

156
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,700
In solos.

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,620
Yeah, in solos.

I mean, we could try friendship.

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,460
We could try diplomacy.

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,460
We will be murdered.

165
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,060

177
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:16,040
it i just siphoned that luck out of your body like no like a
parasite you know like those angler fishes where like uh

178
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:23,980
we're like no no you like the angler fishes where like the
male becomes like a drained husk of a oh that's yes yeah

179
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,780
yeah wait You know the altar, right?

180
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:32,920
Okay, so like for angler, women angler fishes, like the male
angler fishes will attach themselves into the women angler

181
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,820
fish, and then it literally becomes a parasite and slowly
like drains their entire body until it's just like a part of

182
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,060
her.

183
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,380
It just becomes a sperm dispenser.

184
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,900
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,140
I wish I could just be a part of a different analogy, but
you know what?

186
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,860
That's great.

187
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,840
Rose, you can be your sperm dispenser.

188
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,500
Yeah, you're like the luck dispenser.

189
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:06,560
luck perfect perfect well oh my god we'll run with that then
oh my okay gav is battle the parasite yeah wait we are just

190
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:15,980
not going in with a positive outlook on gav's battle guys i
just realized i've reported myself okay arc raiders sense to

191
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:29,340
marvel rivals i need to confirm my sense real quick guys i
know exactly what upset you're using too yeah marvel rivals

192
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:46,180
arc raiders i'm on 800 dpi i use 10 sensitivity 24 point
okay what is 24 apparently it's 24.302 uh where is that do i

193
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:56,720
just have a really low sensitivity i don't know i mine my
marble rival senses 1.89 so there's no point 302 it's just

194
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:08,640
24 okay 24 there you go um all right here we go battle how
do you expect us to do you think we're gonna actually like

195
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:18,320
no yeah i expect uh yeah wait do you want the nice answer do
you want the real answer hey i'm saying our fraggers yeah y

196
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:27,520
'all y'all are probably fucked at least for the first few
hours I am the VTuber Cup Marvel Rivals oh shit I got shot I

197
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,240
got shot

198
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,580
well you know I've seen this in many different areas that
this game is very similar to Marvel Rivals so I think yeah

199
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,980
right the most similar game to it practically identical
almost like a hero shooter there's no other games that can

200
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:53,520
compare the Ark Raiders and the extraction shooter genre to
fly i agree i agree i mean maybe you guys will be fine you

201
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,860
could surprise me the only reason i say that is because i
was terrible at this game for like 30 hours and i have 50

202
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,180
hours how many hours you have wait wait i want to know how
many hours you have i have i have 50 hours in this game at

203
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:14,100
the 30 hour mark well hold on i'm still really bad so i i
don't really uh i don't really know how it's gonna go maybe

204
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:22,280
you guys pick up things faster than me but i'm not very good
at this game you've you're you have your battlefield though

205
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:29,420
your battlefield aim this is a boomer shooter i'm good at
boomer shooters that's like my thing well it's okay dude i'm

206
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:40,620
here i'll teach you oh wait i am slowly load in where am i
downloading items it's a body you're looting yeah but why do

207
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:50,740
the items slowly come up in the container you gotta look for
them no i opened the bag i should see everything She's an

208
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,320
entire Apex player.

209
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,200
This is way too realistic.

210
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,260
I don't like it.

211
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,280
I have drones shooting me.

212
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,340
That's the arc.

213
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,380
Do you guys want Laura?

214
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,720
Do you want me to leave that part out of the video?

215
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,020
Give me the Laura Master.

216
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,040
Give us the Laura Master.

217
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,960
That's the arc.

218
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:09,880
Oh.

219
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,960
So the drone?

220
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,040
Yeah.

221
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,200
And they are bad.

222
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,840
They are bad?

223
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,960
Why are they bad?

224
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,060
What did they do?

225
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,140
Yeah, what did they do?

226
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,180
Did they raid us?

227
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,120
No, we're raiding them.

228
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,760
Oh, oh, that's why they're called Ark Raiders.

229
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,040
Are they real people?

230
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,100
Or are they like...

231
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,520
Title drop.

232
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,760
Are they... Oh, we are in the stream right now.

233
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,260
That's kind of all I really know.

234
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,240
Ark bad.

235
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:46,680
I think they were made by rich people who live on another
planet, and they sent the robots to this planet to kill us

236
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,900
because we suck.

237
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,980
I'm not sure.

238
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,980
Why do we live here just looking for springs and like, yeah,
don't we just want food?

239
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,120
I think, I think, uh...

240
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,240
How are we bad if we're just trying to survive?

241
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,740
I don't think they like, uh, the rich people like us.

242
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,340
I think they want Earth back or something.

243
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,740
Oh, is it because we're poor?

244
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,180
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,380
Oh my gosh.

246
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,480
So they hate us because we're poor.

247
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,360
Yeah, this is so realistic.

248
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Wait, I need, oh my gosh, I need heal myself.

249
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,980
Wait, how do I...

250
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,220
I don't actually know if that's...

251
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,320
a correct spark notes of the lore, by the way, before
everyone gets mad at me.

252
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,840
They steal your credit card information and then what else
do they do?

253
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,140
What else do they do?

254
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,920
Come on, battle.

255
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,860
Come on.

256
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,700
You're the only person that can help us here, man.

257
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,180
Come on.

258
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,840
Enlighten us.

259
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,520
I'll be right back.

260
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,180
I'll be right back.

261
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Oh, do you think he'll come back?

262
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,540
You know, last time you did this, he...

263
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,920
Do you think he'll come back?

264
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,360
Maybe a couple of hours.

265
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,080
Days, years.

266
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,160
Battle.

267
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:00,580
Battle.

268
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,620
Guys, I don't think you'll come back, guys.

269
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,420
Anyone who's watching from Battle stream, please check out
Tara and me out because we'll still be playing.

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,820

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,600

276
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,340

277
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,220
I'm back.

278
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,120
You're a woman.

279
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,680
I'm sorry, I'm not a little boy.

280
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,980
No.

281
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,700
You know, if you, like, actually type on Twitch that you're
12, Twitch will automatically be bad.

282
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:12,240
It will automatically if you type in someone's chat that
you're 12 on Twitch, your account gets instantly banned and

283
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,100
you need to send them a picture of your ID to prove that
you're not actually 12.

284
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,020
What the fuck?

285
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,280
Yeah, you didn't know that?

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,040
I feel like the people who get in trouble for that should
get in trouble for that.

287
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,600
Why would you type like a 12 in chat?

288
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Because you have to be 13.

289
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,980
Okay, so...

290
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,780
Okay, this...

291
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,040
Okay, what colors are you guys wearing for your outfit?

292
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm red.

293
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,080
All right, what are you, Altair?

294
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,480
White and red.

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,820
You chose...

296
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,540
Did both of you choose red?

297
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,580
We got to spread the colors out in case like...

298
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,560
Wait, I'm changing.

299
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,600
Okay, I'm also white and red.

300
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,900
All right, I'm yellow.

301
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Okay, so I'll tell you, you should be blue.

302
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,180
I'm blue.

303
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,980
You should be blue.

304
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,400
Yeah, you should be blue.

305
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,500
Okay, there you go.

306
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,240
All right.

307
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,280
We're good.

308
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,700
So one of us will survive for the war.

309
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,040
One of us will survive.

310
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,340
Or two.

311
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,480
Actually, no.

312
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,580
One of us will survive or two or one of us will die.

313
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,960
Can we have all three live?

314
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,700
I'm not gonna die.

315
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm not gonna die.

316
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,560
We'll be fine, right?

317
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,320
Oh, this is a cool ass cutscene.

318
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,100
I'm watching a cutscene right now, guys.

319
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,520
Oh, hell yeah.

320
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,020
Yeah.

321
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,020
Yeah.

322
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,000
Whoa.

323
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,000
Did you guys...

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
I still can't believe this was made by the guys who did the
finals.

325
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,020
Yeah.

326
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,120
I never played that actually.

327
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,900
I guess it does kind of look a little bit similar, doesn't
it?

328
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,340
Yeah.

329
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,640
I guess like the models look very similar to the finals.

330
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:57,840
something is going on so they made that they have such a
good like back-to-back successes because I know the finals

331
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,100
is really popular in Asia and have a apparently a very

consequences okay we can't be dancing do you wonder if like

Huh?

365
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,740
You don't trust us?

366
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,940
Yeah, come on, Bell.

367
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,340
Yeah, we're really good at this game.

368
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,700
Look at my gun.

369
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,340
It's a rattler.

370
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,680
Yeah, you said you've been playing for like 50 hours.

371
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,840
It doesn't look like you've been playing for 50 hours.

372
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Where's my gun, man?

373
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,340
I said I was bad at this game.

374
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:19,680
so you must have extra loot why didn't you bring it i'd used
a free loadout yeah so you don't trust us wow you don't even

375
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:27,000

many could how many per mag 10 yeah good luck

384
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,020
So guys, if you get shot in the battlefield, you're going to
want to hold down the Q button to activate your quick slot.

385
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,280
You see your quick slot?

386
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,540
Like this?

387
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,260
And there's something called a...

388
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,780
Wait, you said there's no friendly fight.

389
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,000
You friendly fight yourself.

390
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
But I thought that meant I don't get friendly fight.

391
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,800
That is not what that means.

392
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,940
You know that's what that means.

393
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,620
Oh, what are you doing there?

394
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,920
You did it!

395
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,540
I killed!

396
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,540
I killed!

397
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:08,960
I did!

398
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,040
I did it, guys.

399
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,040
You healed yourself.

400
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:12,940
Yay!

401
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,060
Wait, my blood is bad.

402
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,620
How do I?

403
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,440
Look, I'm bandaging myself too.

404
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,040
Here we go.

405
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,340
Well, you've pretty much figured out the game.

406
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:21,920
That's it.

407
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,400
Wait, Drew's made it?

408
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,220
How did I make it?

409
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,400
Now we just loot and shoot.

410
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,340
Okay.

411
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,060
Loot, shoot!

412
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,440
Where do we go?

413
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,780
Better take us.

414
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,820
Well, if you look at your map, you can see these red
highlighted zones.

415
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,520
Those zones have high loot density of better items usually.

416
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,600
but they're normally hot zones for bad guys.

417
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,480
So where are the...

418
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm a bad guy.

419
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,420
So where are they...

420
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,500
Where is the war, like, going on?

421
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,100
Like, we're...

422
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,720
A streamer war?

423
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,560
Yeah, we're...

424
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,900
That's just like by proxy.

425
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,060
It's just everywhere.

426
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
It's just generally in the game.

427
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,260
Like...

428
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,800
Is anybody at war right now?

429
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh, hey, there's stuff here.

430
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,400
Are these good breaches?

431
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,100
Yeah, do you want to...

432
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,780
Do you want to...

433
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,540
Are you breaching that?

434
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,140
Yeah, you're about to get your first loot.

435
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,900
Oh my god, I got plastic and sensors.

436
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,180
Okay.

437
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,140
I'm breaching.

438
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,800
I'm breaching.

439
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,800
I'm playing Rainbow Six Siege.

440
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:12,780
Yep.

441
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,780
Your fuse.

442
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,260
Your fuse.

443
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,080
It takes so fucking long to breach.

444
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,460
Breach.

445
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,120
Shouldn't I be stronger?

446
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,220
Not everything needs to be breached.

447
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,160
But it's like, I've been doing this for my whole life.

448
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,000
Shouldn't I be faster at breaching?

449
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,280
Like, why am I so weak?

450
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,860
Where's my muscle at?

451
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,420
Hey, using that, using a sledgehammer multiple times on a
giant, like, you know, computer structure, probably takes a

452
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,340
lot of energy, I'd say.

453
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,940
Nah, I got that.

454
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,260
Dude, I did that last night.

455
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:40,920
No, it's easy.

456
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:41,920
Yeah, it's easy.

457
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,440
Super easy.

458
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,540
It's like taking.

459
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,260
Are you going to shot at?

460
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,900
Oh, look.

461
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,020
Altair's encountered the ARC TM.

462
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,860
Wait, are they?

463
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,620
Oh, they're the drones.

464
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,620
It's the ARC.

465
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,940
That's the ARC.

466
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,080
Oh, are they?

467
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,420
Now you could watch out for the ARC.

468
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,860
Are they the PVE of the PVE?

469
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,580
Yeah, they're the PVE.

470
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,900
So you shoot their thrusters.

471
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,500
Good work.

472
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,280
You've killed the ARC.

473
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,360
We killed them.

474
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:05,920
We did.

475
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,440
Are you proud of us?

476
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:07,800
Oh, my God.

477
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,940
You searched their dead body.

478
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,880
You can search their dead bodies to get arc cells as well,
which you can then use to make shields.

479
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,020
I got an arc power cell.

480
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,240
How do I make the shields?

481
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,640
Thank you.

482
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,300
Well, you make it outside of the zone, but you can...

483
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,460
Can you make it for me?

484
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,320
Can you make it for me?

485
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:23,980
Shut up.

486
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,360
Hey, shut up.

487
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,960
I unlocked crafting, but I still want you to make it for me.

488
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,640
I don't care.

489
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:28,800
I don't care.

490
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,720
It'll...

491
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,660
But we'll drag you down with us if you don't care.

492
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,720
It's okay.

493
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,140
I'll drag you down to the darkest piece of hell when I go
there.

494
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,120
Whoops.

495
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,800
I missed it.

496
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,820
Okay guys, now those arc power cells went in a pinch you can
equip them to your quick slot by hitting tab in the put them

497
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,280
in the quick use and they can be used as a shield
regenerator Just in case you get hurt and you don't have any

498
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,600
rechargers left Or you take them out with you and you can
you okay.

499
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,400
He's using one.

500
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,080
Okay, good work Wait, it gives him more shields.

501
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,480
How come he has so much more shields than me us?

actually quite proud the only thing is that this game is

798
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:09,470
very stressful and I get I'm under a lot of stress and I am
not exactly a natural born leader because I had a diet coke

799
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,130

00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,850
No, it's not!

805
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,830
You're going to get us to Battle Royale number one.

806
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,150
I have a gun.

807
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,930
It's practically the same game.

808
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,010
You of all people should know that's not true.

809
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,790
Third person, first person.

810
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,050
It's only two degrees of experience.

811
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,910
You know, like Battlefield is first person.

812
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,690
Arc Raider is third person.

813
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,670
Like it's like, it's practically the same thing.

814
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,390
It's like how Overwatch is first person.

815
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,950
Marvel Rivals is third person.

816
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:52,950
wait marvel arrival is this third person yeah what the fuck
yeah are you fucking kidding me that's why they sell so much

817
00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:00,570
skins because because then you can goon to the ass i've
never noticed that that's why yeah i would get it bro they

Yeah, they sponsored another one on the next day.

824
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,610
It's like Fortnite doing that $100 million in their
competitive number when that was announced back in the day.

825
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,270
Yeah, yeah, now every lands do a million dollar tournament.

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,040
This guy ain't friendly.

1022
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,680
This is what we do to friendly people around here.

1023
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,240

1032
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,780
I can't even loot everything.

1033
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,180
Ah!

1034
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,420
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1035
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,500

1040
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,320
Give nothing back.

1041
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,440
All right, let's go.

1042
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:47,940
I shall.

1043
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,180
And stop shooting people and asking them if they're
friendly.

1044
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,780
No, it's friendly.

1045
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,700
Okay, they die.

1046
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,560
Everyone dies.

1047
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,160
Michael Gorbius, are you friendly?

1048
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,960
I think it's funny that, you know, I shoot them and then I
kill them and I'm like, are you friendly?

1049
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,140
You know, just to rub it in.

1050
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,020
And then you kill them too.

1051
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:04,780
You know?

1052
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,800
And it'll be like, it gives them hope that maybe I'll spare
them.

1053
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,160
People are extracting down here.

1054
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,000
Okay.

1055
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,500

00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,520
I die in one shot.

1060
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,340
What we're going to want to do is wait for the tray to get
here and run onto it.

1061
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,640
We don't win this fight, I don't think.

00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,540
Yeah, they look like they're on steroids.

1143
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,260
I wonder what happens if you gave kangaroo steroids.

1144
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,320
Like, can they get buffered?

1145
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,920
Is that like animal abuse?

1146
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,700
Super kangaroo?

1147
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,640
Yeah, I think so.

1148
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:31,000
I was like, like, is that like, is that like, what are they
called when, like, when, like, the thing to be able to use

1149
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,420
animals to test stuff?

1150
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,100
What is that called?

1151
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:39,280
uh animal testing yeah yeah yeah i think that would be for
science you know you i don't know how jacked up can a

1152
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:47,760
kangaroo get like what's the negative consequences of using
steroids other than a smaller domination you guys know that

1153
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:57,920
it shrinks the peepee if you use steroids yeah oh so that's
why mine's so large so i'm just thinking like is it really

1154
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:07,220
animal abuse if are pps or smaller like do you think the
female kangaroos care yeah but do you think like female

1155
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:14,420
kangaroos would care okay what do female kangaroos care
about do they care about that or do they care about what the

1156
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:23,780
size of the pouch is yeah it's not about the size it's the
it's the motion of the ocean you know ocean of the ocean is

1157
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:30,000

01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:08,570
Oh, because there are two people.

1196
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:09,510
Tell them you're friendly.

1197
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,590
If you tell them you're friendly.

1198
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,150
No one's friendly in the scout forsaken world.

1199
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:14,490
You understand?

1200
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:17,370
You're just, you're so pessimistic, Beto.

1201
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,870
We're so jaded.

1202
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:20,750
What happened to this?

1203
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,570
Yeah, Beto, we're friendly.

1204
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:22,370
We're nice.

1205
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:28,770
Yeah, we're, it's because like Altair now, we haven't gone
through the the turmoil of war yet in this game, so.

1206
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,490
We haven't had to see the light leave another's eyes.

1207
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:42,250
and we still have like lights in our eyes and not dead
inside yet man more is so fun we haven't seen our conrad's

1208
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,870
die yet we're still

1209
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:54,310
no i need to extract now battle you could create the most
tragic backstory for you now it's a really hard enough for

1210
01:01:54,310 --> 01:02:03,050
this lifestyle if you die here if you die here that maybe
maybe we'll become just like you Is there this guy yet?

1211
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:03,510
Oh, shit.

1212
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,010
A little bit.

1213
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:04,510
Oh, wait.

1214
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:07,490
I didn't even realize there was a dead guy in front of me.

1215
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:09,170
Wait, wait.

1216
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:10,010
Did you extract it?

1217
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,190
No, I'm trying to get the fuck out of here.

1218
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,230
Better why aren't you extracting?

1219
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:14,670
Shut up!

1220
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:16,870
It's trying to move the fuck out!

1221
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,390
I'm thinking it's right above me!

1222
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:19,770
You're fine.

1223
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,190
Oh!

1224
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,150
Uh-oh.

1225
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,430
Oh, they don't have object permanent.

1226
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:25,630
No!

1227
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:26,750
Whoa!

1228
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:27,710
Wait, you can roll?

1229
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:29,410
Yeah, left off.

1230
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:29,810
Left off.

1231
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:30,850
Oh, my God.

1232
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:31,810
You guys...

1233
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:32,010
Okay.

1234
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,810
That was not in my tutorial.

1235
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,470
It was.

1236
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,110
No, it wasn't.

1237
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:35,910
Maybe you should have asked.

1238
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:37,950
Dude, you didn't tell me.

1239
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:41,310
A coach would tell their student without having to ask.

1240
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,530
Listen, there's a lot of things that I don't understand in
one of those games that I just have to teach me.

1241
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,970
Yeah, and why aren't you teaching me it one by one?

1242
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,410
Oh, my God.

1243
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:53,830
Run, run.

1244
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,450
I hope it shoots you.

1245
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:57,590
I'm your coach.

1246
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,350
You're not doing a very good job at coaching.

1247
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:03,470
Yay!

1248
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,970
You can, oh my god, wait, how do you swap shoulders?

1249
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:10,610
Oh my gosh, did you not go through tutorial?

1250
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,010
You can hit X.

1251
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,770
Oh hey, I got items.

1252
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:15,750
Unload backpack.

1253
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:16,530
Oh!

1254
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,430
It was one item.

1255
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,670
Hit X to swap shoulder, left alt to...

1256
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,090
Oh, okay.

1257
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,890
Yay, thanks coach.

1258
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:26,990
I can craft stuff now.

1259
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:28,890
I found a good weapon.

1260
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,430
A looting MK, light shield.

1261
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,030
Okay, uh, not enough resources.

1262
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,130
Oh, I couldn't craft a hairpin.

1263
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,510
I want to craft a hairpin.

1264
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:41,950
Is hairpin good?

1265
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:43,450
No, it's terrible.

1266
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,210
Oh.

1267
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:44,770
Why?

1268
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:47,710
I feel like you could lock-pick stuff with it, right?

1269
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:49,350
I'll craft this.

1270
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:49,850
Nice altar.

1271
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:53,830
You win the largest comedy joke of the night award.

1272
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:54,650
It wasn't a comedy joke.

1273
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:55,990
I was actually serious about that.

1274
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,410
You can actually lock-pick, right?

1275
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:57,850
Can you?

1276
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,030
So what is a good...

1277
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,550
What is a...

1278
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:18,070
good uh how do i how do i use my backpack oh there i did it
so what is a good gun then well well for starter weapons the

1279
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:24,350
pharaoh is a very good gun but it's better when it's paired
with another weapon a pharaoh is a long-range weapon with

1280
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:30,510
one shot in it and it can and it can it can break shields
pretty quickly if they have light shields it breaks them in

1281
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:34,650
one hit okay but normal what you want to do is shoot them
with the pharaoh then switch to your sidearm and shoot them

1282
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:40,790
with that because you know switch to your sidearm is faster
than reloading plus you can add pressure uh when it comes to

1283
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:46,070
when it comes to that situation after cracking their shields
because they're gonna need to heal can you explain this in

1284
01:04:46,070 --> 01:05:08,170
marvel rival's terms oh um okay so the pharaoh can break
shields oh fuck i don't no you're doing great that all don't

1285
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:17,070
worry so okay you said a very long paragraph and then you
said one sentence well this is tough when you make me

1286
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:22,470
explain it in a game that's not even remotely similar can
you explain it in league of legends terms then wait i don't

1287
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:30,230
play league though can you explain it in uh club penguin
terms club penguin yeah i got banned from club penguin for

1288
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:40,930

1291
01:05:55,870 --> 01:06:04,730

1292
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,110
Beto, why are you red?

1293
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,850
You don't have red in your design.

1294
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:09,530
Why are you red?

1295
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:10,570

01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,080
They might not shoot us because I'm a woman.

Oh, contrary, Doki Bird, they may shoot you more.

01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,520
I don't know.

1442
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,140

01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,780
I don't know where the extraction is.

1444
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,640
This is the first strategy that I've liked so far.

1445
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,540
You're a heartless man.

1446
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:32,440
Yeah.

1447
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,020
Oh, yeah, he's the one that's the issue, not me.

1448
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,820
The who came up with the plan.

1449
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,400
How could you battle?

1450
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,040
Yeah, how could you battle?

1451
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,600
You're the heartless one here, not me.

1452
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:43,860
Yeah, apparently.

1453
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,200
I'm just a woman, you know?

1454
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,600
That was never going to want to play games with me ever
again.

1455
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,120
Well, someone's like, would work if it wasn't Doki Bird.

1456
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,700
These normies don't know who I am, guys.

1457
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,040
We'll be fine.

1458
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,400
My name sounds so, so nice and say so.

1459
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,860
And then Michael Gorbius comes out of the bush and says,
hey, I'm also a woman.

1460
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:14,420
Hello there.

01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,420
Can I use my credit card?

1463
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,980
I'd like to use my credit card.

1464
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,660
Do you have anything gluten-free?

1465
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,680
Oh, hello, there is a- Full inventory, I'm ready to go.

1466
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,440

1467
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,120
I'm going to try and loot this.

1468
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,200
Oh, I'm looting a desk.

1469
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,000
You guys are like raccoons.

1470
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,220
What do you mean by that?

1471
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,620
What do you mean by raccoons, huh?

1472
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:44,660

1473
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,240
Taking all that garbage.

1474
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:47,920
You don't know that.

1475
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,640
I have, like, a purple.

1476
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:50,820
You know what?

1477
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,060
The best way of getting stuff is killing the enemy and
taking all their shit.

1478
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,240
It's instant gratification.

1479
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,680
That's not how I got the legendary.

1480
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,220

01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:11,340

01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,160

01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:30,570
I can hear the flu from like where I'm at the third floor.

1526
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:31,450
Don't tell him!

1527
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:33,750
Don't tell him.

01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:36,510
Oh shit, I'm fine.

1529
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,550

Wait, there's a spider?

1575
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,100
The spider blew up.

1576
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,640
I don't go through here.

1577
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,840
What the fuck is the loot here?

1578
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,800
There's no loot in the subway.

1579
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:47,480
We're not really in a zone that has like loot pools.

1580
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,260
I mean, there'll be stuff scattered around.

1581
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,620
What's the point of being here?

1582
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,900
We got to get into the big building.

1583
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,100
Maybe there's an entrance.

1584
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,280
To get around places.

1585
01:19:59,120 --> 01:19:59,640
Oh shit.

1586
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,320
There's like nothing here.

1587
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:07,750
Nice!

1588
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:08,270
Watch out, fire!

1589
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:09,030
Oh!

1590
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:09,430
Oh!

1591
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:12,030
Somebody pushed me into the fire.

1592
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,890
There's no collision.

1593
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,390
No, no, no, no.

1594
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:18,450
Somebody pushed me.

1595
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:19,530
I saw it.

1596
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,170
We actually don't have shields.

1597
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:21,870
Can that be me?

1598
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,350
You don't have shields here.

1599
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:26,990
Thank you.

1600
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:30,730
Where do I?

1601
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:32,610
Okay.

1602
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,510
Oh, how are you so good?

1603
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,850
We're living.

1604
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:38,550
I would jolt mine.

1605
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,050
If I should save something, what should I say?

1606
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:43,970
Alter, I swear to God!

1607
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:47,930
Cheers.

1608
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,010
We can go launch pad.

1609
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,390
How do you guys get up there?

1610
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,830

01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:55,770
Oh, there.

1612
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:01,430

1613
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,530

1614
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:05,750
Chat chat.

1615
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:08,350
Are there other instruments in this game?

1616
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,070

Nobody's here.

1714
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:09,930
Do you guys want to loot this building?

1715
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,630
Do you want to go inside?

1716
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:12,650
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1717
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:14,590
Hornet, what's a hornet?

1718
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,140
Get the thing on this.

01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1720
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:25,900
Ow!

1721
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,060
I'm getting lasered.

1722
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,180
Okay, that's it.

1723
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,540
I'm using the other gun.

1724
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:35,270
I have another...

1725
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:35,990
I'm running out of ammo.

1726
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:39,930
I have a tire shield.

1727
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:43,210
Oh!

1728
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:45,250
We're fine, right?

1729
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:47,670
These things do so much damage.

1730
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,790
They do a lot of damage, and they're tanky as fuck.

1731
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:50,630
They're annoying as hell.

1732
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:51,090
I hate it.

1733
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:51,650
That's really annoying.

1734
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:54,930
I think this is an annoying part of Arc Raiders, the Arc
part.

1735
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:56,250
Yes, yes.

1736
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:57,270
The Arc part is not us.

1737
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,890
It's my least favorite part.

1738
01:26:59,150 --> 01:26:59,290
Yeah.

1739
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:02,290
The Arc part of the Arc Raiders is pretty annoying.

1740
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,270
Yeah, I agree.

1741
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,250
Medium ammo.

1742
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,050
Over here.

1743
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:07,570
That's what you need for the gun that you had, isn't it?

1744
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:09,010
No, I used Light Noamma.

1745
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:09,590
Oh.

1746
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,390
Oh, can you give me my gunback then?

1747
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:12,050
Okay.

1748
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:13,870
Here we go.

1749
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,150
I don't need the ammo.

1750
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:19,130
Oh, there's another guy up there.

1751
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:21,410
Yeah, shoot their thrusters.

1752
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:24,630
Is that how you get rid of them faster?

1753
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,030
Yeah, apparently.

1754
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:26,650
I said that already.

1755
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:28,550
Oh, my bad.

1756
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:29,550
No.

1757
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:32,750
You guys are too busy fucking giggling at the summer party.

1758
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:33,310
I remembered.

1759
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:33,750
I remembered.

1760
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:35,890
I didn't say I didn't know.

1761
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:36,050
Okay, okay, okay.

1762
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:36,950
That was my fault.

1763
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:37,630
That was my fault.

1764
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:38,670
I shouldn't have walked you in.

1765
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:42,010
Hey, why don't you group me up with Altair?

1766
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:44,570
Why did you group me up with this guy?

1767
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:45,490
I'm noticing a constant.

1768
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:46,310
It's been Altair.

1769
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,650
Betel, why are you grouping me up with Altair?

1770
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:53,110
Oh, damn it good.

1771
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:54,410
You never expect that one.

1772
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,250
Look, yeah, Altair's a visual learner.

1773
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:00,810
You need to be like extra slow with him.

1774
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:03,510
Yeah, Betel, can you show me your credit card?

1775
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:05,850
Wait, where's the extraction?

1776
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:07,070
I don't own a credit card.

1777
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:08,690
Yeah, you don't want to extract?

1778
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:09,570
Don't trust the banks.

1779
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:10,850
I'm just going, Nate.

1780
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:12,910
Okay, let's extract guys.

1781
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:13,430

1782
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:14,010
Okay.

1783
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:14,290
Okay.

1784
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,110
Never trust the banks.

1785
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:17,870
Thanks guys.

1786
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:20,150
Invest in gold and hide it under your bed.

1787
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,690
Invest in mattress.

1788
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,290
Oh yeah, it's true.

1789
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:26,710
The mattress value will never drop.

1790
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:27,890
That's right.

1791
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:32,210

inventory?

Oh, there you go.

Let's hear it fucking ready up.

1874
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:12,630
I'm sorry!

1875
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:14,270
I have a full inventory!

1876
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:14,990
I can't!

1877
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:17,130
I'm trying to figure out what I can do!

1878
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:19,090
Bro, I was doing mathematics right now.

1879
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,170
Bro, you just started playing the game.

1880
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:22,830
What kind of mathematics are you doing?

1881
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:23,430
Yeah!

1882
01:35:24,030 --> 01:35:24,650
What do you have?

1883
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:27,010
Yeah, what do you fucking have?

1884
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:28,230
We just started!

1885
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:28,890
Too much!

1886
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,170
It's not letting me start!

1887
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:34,230
Okay, whatever.

1888
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:36,630
I guess I'm just not going to go free.

1889
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:39,810
What?

1890
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,890
All right, let's go.

1891
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:44,850
All right, I'm ready.

1892
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,510
All right, yeah, I'll go.

1893
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,310
Oh, that was easy.

1894
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,950
I can't wait.

1895
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:57,710
Wait, have you just been doing randomize or something for
maps?

1896
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,430
No, I've just been kind of picking whichever.

1897
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:02,730
It's just been feeling it.

1898
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:07,670
out yeah feeling it out well here we go

1899
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:18,650
all right guys we could do the we could do the doki strategy
on top of the other strategy that i'm thinking of here okay

1900
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:25,790
what was the other strategy there's a place i go that i like
to hide in and i go out and jump at people and scare them if

1901
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:38,030
we go there fast oh we got a good spawn for it we could use
doki as bait yeah and hide behind these boxes and jump out

1902
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:39,310
and shoot them.

1903
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:40,710
Yippee, baby.

1904
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:41,730
Let's go quick, quick, quick.

1905
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,150
We have a great spawn and we will definitely be the first
ones there.

1906
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:46,990
It might take a minute for people to get there.

1907
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:50,790
But you won't need to bait them by like talking in chat
like, oh, help, you know.

1908
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:51,590
You just, you know.

1909
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,010
No, no, I'll just be like, hello.

1910
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:55,430
Are you guys friendly?

1911
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:57,250
Well, you should hide that voice.

1912
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,210
I do not have a good gun for this.

1913
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:04,090
My team died and I just started playing.

1914
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:08,630
They're like, my team left me.

1915
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:12,290
They just shoot me on the spot if I did that.

1916
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:14,610
Oh, they might shoot you at the spot, too.

1917
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:16,190
No, no, no.

1918
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,410
If they shoot me in the spot, then they're very bad people.

1919
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:20,590
Wait, there's people.

1920
01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:21,610
Alarm, alarm.

1921
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:22,970
How do you know?

1922
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:25,290
Oh, is that?

1923
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:26,970
Am I...

1924
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:28,130
Am I headshots on backwards?

1925
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:30,030
Do you know where you're going?

1926
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:31,910
Uh, yeah.

1927
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:34,210
Wait.

1928
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:37,030
What?

1929
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:37,310
Yes.

1930
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:39,250
We're here.

1931
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:40,050
We're here.

1932
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:41,770
We're going to have to destroy the earth first.

1933
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:44,730
Oh my god, that was scary.

1934
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:47,790
These poor arcs, what do they do?

1935
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:48,930
So?

1936
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:49,630
Yeah.

1937
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:50,990
Oh, it's this spot!

1938
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:52,170
This is where we got the legendary.

1939
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:52,910
Remember this?

1940
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:54,830
Wait, don't open it.

1941
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:55,290
Don't open it.

1942
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:56,730
If it's open, then maybe...

1943
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:58,730
No, just open one.

1944
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:59,290
Yeah, it's correct.

1945
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:00,190
Okay.

1946
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:01,430
Now we hide here.

1947
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:03,330
Yeah.

1948
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:06,550
And Doki, you could be like, here.

1949
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:08,090
Yeah, yeah.

1950
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:08,990
I'll be where here.

1951
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:11,190
It'd be like where that ping is.

1952
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:13,710
If you want to use yourself as bait, after all.

1953
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,170
Okay.

1954
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:17,410
But what if they just shoot, what if they shoot me before I
could tell that you're here?

1955
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:22,030
Well, isn't that kind of part of the strategy that you
already intended on happening?

1956
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:22,490
That's true.

1957
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:23,130
No, no.

1958
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:28,150
But like, it would be better if they don't see me and then
I'm like to hear the voice inside, you know?

1959
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:28,530
Okay.

1960
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:29,050
Okay.

1961
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:29,590
Yeah.

1962
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:32,130
I mean, then you could come hide with us if you want to do
it that way.

1963
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:35,910
We'll do it that way and then I'll come out.

1964
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:36,890
Oh, hello?

1965
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:38,410
Oh, there's people there.

1966
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:38,670
Hello?

1967
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:40,570
Are you guys friendly?

1968
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:42,770
Yes.

1969
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:46,910
Oh, hi Sorry my my team died.

1970
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:47,770

1972
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:49,150

I'm low.

1982
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,300
There's one left.

1983
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,400
There's one left Sorry, what happened wait, wait, wait.

1984
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:30,400

01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:40,100
I'm not part of this Sorry, let me put let me put one
mushroom in my ass Huh, and then kill me.

1986
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,200
That's all I need for that fucking chicken.

1987
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:42,440
Nice.

1988
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:42,700
Nice.

1989
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,360
What chicken?

1990
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,380
He wants to put a mushroom on his butt.

1991
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,720
He said chicken Come here.

1992
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,820
Let me just grab this mushroom that's over here.

1993
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,000
Yeah, he's getting his friends up.

1994
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:55,920
I think It's literally behind this.

1995
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:57,420
What's going on?

1996
01:39:57,820 --> 01:39:58,260
I'm shielding.

1997
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:58,680
I'm shielding.

1998
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,060
I'm shielding.

1999
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:10,310
I told you guys the women's trap works.

2000
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:11,370
I did work.

2001
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:11,830
It worked.

2002
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:12,510
I told you guys.

2003
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:22,030
I told you guys, you said believe me.

2004
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:22,130
Yeah.

I'm going in at all.

2006
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:27,590
Where's it?

2007
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:28,830
Oh, behind me.

2008
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,230
I can't focus.

2009
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,810
I can't focus at all.

2010
01:40:32,410 --> 01:40:33,210
I can't focus.

2011
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:35,670
I can't focus at all.

2012
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:38,670
Doki, you're only in hope.

2013
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:39,430
You're only hoping.

2014
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:41,310
I'm thinking, look.

2015
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:42,850

2016
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:43,670
You're going!

2017
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,250
You're going to leave me, guys.

2018
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:47,130
Doki!

2019
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:47,810
Hey!

2020
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:56,050
Hey buddy, can you pick me up please?

2021
01:40:58,450 --> 01:40:59,130
Hey, I don't know.

2022
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:00,490
I'm new to this game.

2023
01:41:00,710 --> 01:41:01,810
I don't know what I'm doing.

2024
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:03,930
I hope you guys are having a good day today.

2025
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:05,930
Have you guys heard of VTubers?

2026
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:11,870
You know, they were not going to shoot us if you didn't.

2027
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:13,330
Why is that the whole point?

2028
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,790
Why is there no, no, no.

2029
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:22,350
I meant like, I meant like, why didn't you Let all of them
come in before you fucking shot them.

2030
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:26,730
This is so fucking stupid.

2031
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:27,710
The whole point.

2032
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:28,450
What is stupid?

2033
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:30,070
The whole point.

2034
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:31,330
No, no, no.

2035
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:33,930
You guys fucked up the strat.

2036
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:35,290
You guys fucked up the strat.

2037
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:35,870
That is not true.

2038
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:36,730
We did exactly.

2039
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:37,730
We did not.

2040
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:39,850
We literally magned up the guy.

2041
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:42,170
You guys didn't do the strat currently.

2042
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:43,390
You gotta wait for all the力.

2043
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:44,190
I blame the woman.

2044
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:47,430
I, that was a successful bet.

2045
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:58,990
that bait was so fucking successful it was a success no no

Yeah, premature shooting there.

2054
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:17,410
Yeah, exactly.

2055
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:20,290
That was pitiful.

2056
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:21,050
We got to try again.

2057
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:22,530
Yeah, we got to try this shot.

2058
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:24,430
We'll execute it correctly now.

2059
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:26,270
I am not about to be gaslit.

2060
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:28,170
I'll tell you should be the woman next.

2061
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:29,130
What do you mean?

2062
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:31,590
Hello?

2063
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:32,110
Hello?

2064
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:33,930
No, it's too obvious.

2065
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:36,930
Hey.

2066
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:39,870
Yeah, do better, guys.

2067
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:40,850
Do better.

2068
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:42,330
Just, I'm going to freak out.

2069
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:47,290
Hey, but it worked.

2070
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:49,930
I told you the woman's shot works.

2071
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:55,750
Wait, there's a voice changer in the game.

2072
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:57,390
Yeah, there is.

2073
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:03,290
Okay.

2074
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:08,350
Where's like a charm?

2075
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:13,670
Also, what the fuck were they saying?

2076
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:16,330
He was like, are you part of the, is that the team names?

2077
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:19,370
I see he's probably talking about the streamer teams, yeah.

2078
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:20,670
Oh, I was like, what?

2079
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:23,090
I was actually, that one was true.

2080
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:25,170
That one wasn't a lie for that reaction.

2081
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:25,770
That was actual confusion.

2082
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:27,750
That's really, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2083
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:30,250
Okay, guys.

2084
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:32,170
I'm giving people trust issues.

2085
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:32,810
Let's go.

2086
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:36,130
Now this is a fun game.

2087
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:40,030
I'm laying, I'm going to this time, layout mines.

2088
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:41,150
Yeah.

2089
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:42,610
Oh, oh.

2090
01:44:44,230 --> 01:44:46,610
Oh, so you're bringing your big guns then this time.

2091
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:47,450
Not really.

2092
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:50,570
I'm just bringing one mine to see if anyone steps on it.

2093
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:55,010
Wait, there's no friendly fire on the mines, right?

2094
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:56,310
There is.

2095
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:57,530
I think you could trip on.

2096
01:44:57,650 --> 01:45:00,410
You could probably trip on them, so be careful.

2097
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:02,630
Beto, you shouldn't have told me that.

2098
01:45:04,410 --> 01:45:04,610
Okay.

2099
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:05,510
You know, me and mines.

2100
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:06,810
I don't know.

2101
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:09,050
We'll have a blast, buddy.

2102
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:09,670
Come on.

2103
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:12,530
Me, you, the stratosphere.

2104
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:13,650
Okay.

2105
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:23,380
No, guys, I won't step on it, guys.

2106
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:24,260
I'll be okay.

2107
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,240
I believe in us.

2108
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:31,280
Okay, I'm going to try something out.

2109
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:35,580
The thing is, the mines might bait this plan.

2110
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:38,580
They might see it before they come in.

2111
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:38,920
Before they see it?

2112
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,240
What about nades?

2113
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,400
Nades are good.

2114
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,440
Can we do nades instead?

2115
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,560
Are we heading there now?

2116
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:46,840
Do you want to go?

2117
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:47,640
Do you want to do it again?

2118
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,400
Yeah, let's do it.

2119
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:48,740
Let's do it.

2120
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:57,920
work maybe i don't it up yeah yeah exactly now oh oh that
was now that i've been sufficiently gaslit into my own

2121
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:09,180
ability okay then that that voice changes shit is so bad
that it's not convincing at all i'm a girl i'm a real boy

2122
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:19,120

turned off because I'm ready for the impending just

2123
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:19,880
awfulness.

2124
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,180
He's using the voice changer right now.

2125
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:25,500
He sounds like a fucking... It does not sound like a girl.

2126
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:29,220
I will say it does not sound like a girl out there.

2127
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,750
Oh my god, he's a real girl now.

2128
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:41,390
Honestly, Beto, you're missing out.

2129
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:43,770
They're not saying any gamer words yet.

2130
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:45,150
Yet.

2131
01:46:45,850 --> 01:46:47,050
You're missing out, bro.

2132
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:49,030
I've lost one VOD already, alright?

2133
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:52,070
You're missing out.

2134
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:55,150
Fucking fucking.

2135
01:46:57,190 --> 01:46:57,930
I'm fine.

2136
01:46:58,670 --> 01:46:59,370
He didn't shoot me.

2137
01:46:59,610 --> 01:46:59,970
Yeah, I'm fine.

2138
01:47:00,190 --> 01:47:00,370
I'm fine.

2139
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:00,930
I'm fine.

2140
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:01,390
I'm fine.

2141
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:02,410
It didn't shoot me.

2142
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:04,650
Is that turret?

2143
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:07,290
Yeah, there's a sniper turret.

2144
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:14,120
It's like aiming at you only.

2145
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:17,020
Yeah.

2146
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:20,300
That's okay.

2147
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,240
You're on a free loadout.

2148
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:35,780
I know I'm not wait you're not oh oh you you want to
distract the work work I want to win you understand should

2151
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:54,480
Hello?

2152
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,380
This isn't the place.

2153
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:57,720
Oh.

2154
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:58,580
You gotta keep going.

2155
01:47:58,740 --> 01:47:59,700
This looked like the place.

2156
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:00,760
It's similar.

2157
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:01,940
It's similar.

2158
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,160
Also, Altair, you're still muted, by the way.

2159
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,760
You're just trying to talk to us.

2160
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:13,240
This is the place.

2161
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,920
Sorry, I didn't have time to unmute.

2162
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:17,380
I was dodging for my life.

2163
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:19,120
Oh.

2164
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:19,660
Oh.

2165
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:20,660
All right.

2166
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:21,160
What was that?

2167
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:22,340
It's unloaded.

2168
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,040
Oh, yeah.

2169
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:25,420
Oh!

2170
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:25,940
Oh!

2171
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:26,800
What is this?

2172
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,120
What?

2173
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:30,020
Drones!

2174
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:31,680
Ah!

2175
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,020
That's what it is, buddy.

2176
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,560
Oh, there's the box, my favorite box.

2177
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,520
It's probably okay.

2178
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:42,000
I don't think so.

2179
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:43,500
Okay.

2180
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,700
I'm dead!

2181
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,100
All right, I got a rubber pad.

2182
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,560
Oh, that's a lot of items.

2183
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:54,880
See, I told you, I gotta not stand in the middle.

2184
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,640
I gotta wait.

2185
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:57,160
Thank you.

2186
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,820
There are a couple drones behind you guys.

2187
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,480
There's a gun case behind me?

2188
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:03,760
What's a gun case?

2189
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:04,280
This?

2190
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,040
Is this a gun case?

2191
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:10,440
No, that's rubber parts.

2192
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:17,900
No, we gotta leave it unlooted, guys, for this to work.

2193
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:20,760
Alright, guys.

Gun shots.

Very close.

2206
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,540
Let me know if you were coming because I don't know the
actual sound for footsteps in this game.

2207
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,600
They're close.

2208
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,880
You might want to start talking in the general area.

2209
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:44,520
Hello?

2210
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,000
I feel so...

2211
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,740
We're sick.

2212
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,780
That confusion in her voice just so much.

2213
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,760
She fains innocence too well.

2214
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:57,560
Yeah, you like that?

2215
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:57,880
Yeah.

2216
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,360
It's called acting.

2217
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,920
Well, I'm going to search this just in case.

2218
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:07,380
Hey, battle.

2219
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,340
Do you have any bandages left?

2220
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,480
I don't hear anyone.

2221
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,980
Are you sure people are going to come here?

2222
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:21,420
I swear to God, you blow my cover out here after everything
we set up for.

2223
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:22,480
We're being shot.

2224
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:24,060
Hello?

2225
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:26,460
Ain't no freaking way.

2226
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:27,680
No way!

2227
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:28,580
Hello?

2228
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:30,780
Are you kidding me?

2229
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,240
They're coming in.

2230
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:31,840
They're coming in.

2231
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:33,100
Are you guys friendly?

2232
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:36,100
Wait, are they...

2233
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:36,940
I don't feel friendly.

2234
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:37,960
I just killed this lady.

2235
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,220
Wait, what?

2236
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:41,880
Wait, there was a person here?

2237
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:44,360
Guys.

2238
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:46,820
I'm dead.

2239
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,140
Wait, guys, don't kill me, please.

2240
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,060
Wait.

2241
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,100
Are they dead?

2242
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:54,440
Can you let me up, please?

2243
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:55,960
I just want to play with you.

2244
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,160
Sorry, what?

2245
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:58,140
No!

2246
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,320
Like, I told you.

2247
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,680
I told you that's jack's not going to work.

2248
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:05,060
As soon as it went out, you slice me the head.

2249
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:05,960
Are you kidding me?

2250
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,240
I told you guys.

2251
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,800
Okay, you fucking blew our cover.

2252
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:12,340
You fucking, I'll take.

2253
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:14,620
You fucking blew our cover.

2254
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:16,720
Betel is mad now.

2255
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:19,300
Betel is fucking mad.

2256
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:22,160
Betel, I played my part.

2257
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,100
I played my part.

2258
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,040
Yeah, you did pay your part.

2259
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:28,560
I played my part.

2260
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,980
If I got a bandage, I'd be okay.

2261
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:34,760
You did not need a bandage.

2262
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:37,500
As soon as I step out and go loot something, they
immediately snipe me.

2263
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:38,700
You did not need a bandage, bro.

2264
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,900
Yeah, I don't think they're friendly, guys.

2265
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,140
I need that bandage.

2266
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,540
I got a one-shot, clearly.

2267
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,100
I don't even have, like, a person to help use this, do the
strat.

2268
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:51,300
Not to actually be friends with someone.

2269
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:52,100
Now...

2270
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:54,420
You could have been.

2271
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,020
You gotta make me...

2272
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,960
Oh, my God.

2273
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,540
I gotta be friends with someone for real.

2274
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:12,080

part of the strat works my my the second half that's the

One more time.

01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:03,220
How stupid.

2281
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,560
Try it again.

2282
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,840
Look at my furry city.

2283
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:14,560

I'm bringing a gun.

2285
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:19,880
I'm bringing a gun.

2286
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,120
I'm just saying.

2287
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,320

2291
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:02,420
Hi, Hakka.

2292
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:04,760
Does Hakka play this game?

2293
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:06,880
I don't think so.

2294
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,580
Betel is poor now.

2295
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:11,560
Just like us.

2296
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:13,080
Betel's poor.

2297
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,500
Just like us.

2298
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,140
Okay.

2299
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:19,260
Deep breaths.

2300
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:20,060
Okay.

2301
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,820
Let's do it again, guys.

2302
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:23,700
Okay, okay.

2303
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:24,960
All right.

2304
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:26,600
I believe, I believe in the strat.

2305
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:27,660
Okay.

2306
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,380
The last try if it doesn't work.

2307
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,660
It's not it worked on my end single inch.

2308
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:37,420
I'm not making a single sound It worked on my end.

2309
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:45,260
It's a success for me So okay, let me let me understand this
let me understand the protocol here So you lure them in and

2310
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:52,420
you just want me and all terror to shoot the three gods Yes
Because you understand that we are still at a disadvantage

2311
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:54,860
even if we get to jump on them You understand that right?

2312
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,460
And then she runs away valiantly.

2313
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,320
I did shoot my gun.

2314
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:02,960
Are you going to shoot your gun?

2315
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,200
I need to understand the situation that I'm going to be.

2316
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:13,500
Now that I've realized that the two men I brought couldn't
finish the job, I shall also participate in the shooting.

2317
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:14,880
Okay.

2318
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,120
Good.

2319
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,440
Because we kind of...

2320
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:19,620
Yeah.

2321
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:20,040
Okay.

2322
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,180
No, we're good.

2323
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:21,820
Yeah.

2324
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:27,120
I'm just saying, like, you know, I didn't realize I had to
get my hands wet as well.

2325
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:37,040
that blood i didn't realize i had to i had to get my hands
wet with the blood as well i didn't realize that i thought i

2326
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:40,820

playing the mind games part you know i thought those hands

2327
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:52,060

the stream he's gonna kill us it's fine i didn't realize i

2328
01:56:52,060 --> 01:57:01,500
gotta also do more also didn't really I didn't realize that
I forgot gravity is a thing in this game.

2329
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:02,360
It's so realistic.

2330
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,340
Oh, there's people nearby.

2331
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:06,400

Are we gonna interact with these people or still go to our
house?

2336
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:16,240
Well, we could try and intersect.

2337
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:18,940
We're gonna arrive at the house.

2338
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,440
They might be on the way there.

2339
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:21,140

2340
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:21,540

Do you want to go to the house?

2344
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:24,680

Like, I feel like a tutorial doesn't really teach you how to
find the extraction.

2388
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,100
Oh, we're horrible.

2389
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:51,780
Oh, so just head like Southwest, like this way.

2390
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,980
And then there's like an extractor.

2391
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:00,590
Why did they take- This is the first time in here?

2392
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:02,690
Yeah, no, this is my second game.

2393
02:01:03,690 --> 02:01:06,530
My friends kept telling me to play this game, so I tried.

2394
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:08,290
I'm so confused.

2395
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:14,850
Sorry, what do you say?

2396
02:01:15,290 --> 02:01:17,170
Sorry, the mic quality is pretty- Oh.

2397
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:19,650
Look at this basket?

2398
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:20,010
Okay.

2399
02:01:20,670 --> 02:01:22,350
Oh, they're too nice.

2400
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:23,150
Oh, God.

2401
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:24,470
Oh, thank you.

2402
02:01:24,690 --> 02:01:26,410
No problem.

2403
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:27,950
Oh my god, bro!

2404
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:29,710
Okay, okay.

2405
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:31,990
They're in the woods that way.

2406
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:33,250
Oh, okay, okay.

2407
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:35,410
There's an extract that way.

2408
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:36,410
Oh, thank you.

2409
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:37,690
Thank you guys.

2410
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:39,190
I don't want to do this anymore.

2411
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:41,710
I don't like this anymore.

2412
02:01:43,110 --> 02:01:44,090
On your back.

2413
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:46,890
Oh, okay, I see, I see.

2414
02:01:46,990 --> 02:01:48,290
This isn't what a hero does.

2415
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:50,150
Yeah, it's in the middle of the woods.

2416
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:51,150
Oh, okay, okay.

2417
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:54,210
There's like some more stuff I didn't do over there.

2418

Tell them to fucking get the fuck out of here.

2436
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:34,170
I can't stand them anymore.

2437
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:37,730
Wait, guys, I think there's people in here now.

She's running!

2446
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:53,670
We didn't lock their car.

02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:54,470

Whatever.

2455
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:25,270
Yeah, it's fine.

2456
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:26,090
I've lost the care.

2457
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:27,070
You kill them now.

2458
02:04:27,250 --> 02:04:27,690
It's okay.

2459
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:29,110
I got shot by an arc.

2460
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:32,790
Wait, did you kill them?

2461
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:33,790
No.

2462
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:34,670
Uh, no.

2463
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:35,550
Oh, okay.

2464
02:04:35,770 --> 02:04:36,390
They said it right.

2465
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:37,570
One on our left, one on our right.

2466
02:04:38,690 --> 02:04:39,530
They just left.

2467
02:04:39,730 --> 02:04:40,030
I don't know.

2468
02:04:40,090 --> 02:04:40,670
I need to get Doki.

2469
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:41,970
Yeah, yeah, get me over here.

2470
02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:42,850
I'm in this bush.

2471
02:04:43,610 --> 02:04:45,630
Yeah, they- no, they were fighting a big robot.

2472
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:48,210
I'm in this bush.

2473
02:04:48,290 --> 02:04:49,110
They're still fighting it, I think.

2474
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:49,910
We're good.

2475
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:50,510
That's fine.

2476
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:56,790
Okay, guys, I think I'm still really growing a conscience.

2477
02:04:58,570 --> 02:05:00,050
Only think you three tries.

2478
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:01,030
Here's the problem.

2479
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:06,090
Growing a conscience in this game revolves around people
talking to you, because odds are they will talk to you, and

2480
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:07,610
the second they do, they gain humanity.

2481
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:08,550
Yeah, and they...

2482
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:09,170
Oh, my.

2483
02:05:09,330 --> 02:05:10,550
I don't know, man.

2484
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:13,370
They gave me free stuff, and I'm very easily bribable.

2485
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:19,970
I think if they didn't give me free stuff, I don't think I
would have...

2486
02:05:19,970 --> 02:05:21,890
I think I would have let them die.

2487
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:27,450
I don't know who I'm shooting.

2488
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:28,070
I don't care anymore.

2489
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:32,490
I don't know if it's conscience or like, or like, I just
like being bribed.

2490
02:05:32,630 --> 02:05:33,830
It could be one or the other.

2491
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:34,630
It could be both.

2492
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:36,330
Yeah, it could be both, honestly.

2493
02:05:38,990 --> 02:05:42,110
And if I do like, you can keep that, I'm like, oh, nice.

2494
02:05:42,490 --> 02:05:43,310
We killed one of them.

2495
02:05:43,610 --> 02:05:44,530
Oh, you killed one of them?

2496
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:46,070
Wait, wait, are you?

2497
02:05:46,210 --> 02:05:46,730
Who are you?

2498
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:47,950
Don't talk to him!

2499
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:49,310
What about his fucking misery?

2500
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:49,630
Wait, wait, wait.

2501
02:05:49,670 --> 02:05:51,230
I'll be like, are you friendly?

2502
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:52,830
Are you friendly?

2503
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:54,130
No, no, no.

2504
02:05:54,290 --> 02:05:55,250
I'll be, I'll talk over.

2505
02:05:55,730 --> 02:05:55,890
Wait.

2506
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:59,090
Oh my god, I got hit by the rock.

2507
02:05:59,290 --> 02:06:01,870
I hate, I hate these goddamn arcs.

2508
02:06:01,970 --> 02:06:05,090
How do I pick you up?

2509
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:09,130
Oh, oh, I found some.

2510
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:10,430
Wait, don't kill them.

2511
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:11,010
Don't kill them.

2512
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:11,730
They're my friends.

2513
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:12,530
Don't kill them.

2514
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:13,230
Don't kill them.

2515
02:06:13,370 --> 02:06:14,130
Did I stabilize you?

2516
02:06:14,350 --> 02:06:15,250
Wait, wait, how do I?

2517
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:18,030
Guys, the Rocketeers, you guys got to get the fuck out.

2518
02:06:18,150 --> 02:06:19,230
You can't be RPing with this guy.

2519
02:06:19,370 --> 02:06:20,150
He's your guy explode.

2520
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:20,750
Don't kill them.

2521
02:06:20,770 --> 02:06:21,190
Don't kill them.

2522
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:21,390
Don't kill them.

2523
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:23,030
I'm out of ammo.

2524
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:23,790
I'm sorry, buddy.

2525
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:24,750
I'm sorry.

2526
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:25,350
Battery.

2527
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:26,870
Use a bandage.

2528
02:06:27,070 --> 02:06:27,450
Use a bandage.

2529
02:06:27,670 --> 02:06:27,850
I died.

2530
02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:28,350
I died.

2531
02:06:31,690 --> 02:06:39,790
No, I wanted to make it so that they think that we're not on
the same team together.

2532
02:06:40,070 --> 02:06:40,930
You gave us immunity.

2533
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:42,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2534
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:44,190
So like, oh, wait.

2535
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:45,750
The rocket killed both of us.

2536
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:46,370
So no, no, no.

2537
02:06:46,450 --> 02:06:47,350
This is a long Kong.

2538
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:48,050
You don't understand.

2539
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:52,390
It was more so like I was trying to make them think that I
found new friends.

2540
02:06:52,410 --> 02:07:02,250
friends and i saved their lives because because like i i
spared him fucking way so by me sparing sparing him he's

2541
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:09,630
gonna remember guys i'm about to die michael gorgias michael
gorgias i have five seconds left and my plan will not work

2542
02:07:09,630 --> 02:07:19,110
if you let me die this thing's fucking chasing me you guys
it's my time to it's so this is my strat this was my

2543
02:07:19,110 --> 02:07:29,410
original strat i thought i think you'd like scared hello i'm
all alone hello okay so also did the guy like full dive

2544
02:07:29,410 --> 02:07:37,770
because of the rocket yeah oh okay so this was my original
strat i'd be like my initial plan was that i'd be like don't

2545
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:44,230
kill him so they remembered that i spared them from their
deaths but then i'll be like guys oh i made these new

2546
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:52,650
friends and be like oh i made these new friends and i in in
like um i'm helping you guys and then they'll be like oh

2547
02:07:52,650 --> 02:08:02,810
she's not associated with you two you know and because of
that they'll like trust us more because of it and yeah you

2548
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:12,290
should fold that that way shot is up oh you think you're
being executed you're being executed look at that if you

2549
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:20,390
went with my shot he would have picked you up i was going to
kill him and you said to I was literally five seconds away

2550
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:21,710
from just killing this guy.

2551
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:28,550
So I think you need to use two bandages to stabilize it down
to enemy player.

2552
02:08:28,890 --> 02:08:29,110
I think.

2553
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:31,610
We need to, you know, you need a defibrillator.

2554
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:32,390
No, no, no.

2555
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:35,750
Guys, guys, I think the fourth try, we can do it.

2556
02:08:36,170 --> 02:08:36,950
Just trust me.

2557
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:38,330
Like, I...

2558
02:08:38,330 --> 02:08:39,090
One more.

2559
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:40,790
I think we can do it.

2560
02:08:40,850 --> 02:08:41,810
The fourth try.

2561
02:08:41,970 --> 02:08:44,110
I think we can do it.

2562
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:46,050
I got it all set up.

2563
02:08:46,070 --> 02:08:46,290
That all.

2564
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:48,070
I can...

2565
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:49,910
I think we can do this.

2566
02:08:50,090 --> 02:08:51,070
I think we can do it.

2567
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:54,510
We just need to not come across such nice people.

2568
02:08:55,050 --> 02:08:55,510
Yeah, yeah.

2569
02:08:55,990 --> 02:09:00,030
It's just that the fact that they bribed me at the end,
like, fucked me up.

2570
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:01,310
Like, I was ready.

2571
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:03,790
I was, like, you know, I was building their trust.

2572
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:04,970
And then they bribed me.

2573
02:09:05,150 --> 02:09:07,210
And then, and then it fucked me up.

2574
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:11,890
But if they don't bribed me, it'll be fine.

2575
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:16,830
Okay.

2576
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:35,170
I'm not lousy bait I fucking baited two teams it's just that
I was so convincing that I was so innocent that like they

2577
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:44,250
were so trusting in me they were so trusting like they could
not see through the lies okay dokey dokey you need to get

2578
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:48,430
them into the corner somehow so maybe ask them like, hey,
how do you open up this, this, this loop box?

2579
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:50,230
Okay, no, then they know it's a fucking bait.

2580
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:52,850
Like, the E button is right there.

2581
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:54,010
Okay, okay.

2582
02:09:54,070 --> 02:09:55,390
Something a little bit different, then.

2583
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:58,670
You should open up a shop.

2584
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:06,070
I should be like, okay, okay, wait, I got the strat.

2585
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:08,290
I got, I got, no, trust me, trust me in this.

2586
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:09,950
I got a new, a new honeypot.

2587
02:10:10,330 --> 02:10:12,530
I got a new honeypot, like, crafted.

2588
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:15,790
Okay.

2589
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:17,690
There's in-game voice change.

2590
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:19,570
Yeah, guys, no, Altair tried it and it was dog shit.

2591
02:10:20,030 --> 02:10:22,250
You need a real woman to do this.

2592
02:10:23,970 --> 02:10:25,890
I will concede there.

2593
02:10:28,190 --> 02:10:29,210
Boy, I am no woman.

2594
02:10:29,730 --> 02:10:31,270
I played plenty of Overwatch.

2595
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:33,210
I know how to do this.

2596
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:40,250
I've seen the ways in Overwatch, guys.

2597
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:45,750
Hey, check out this dark and foreboding hallway.

2598
02:10:46,990 --> 02:10:50,070
I've encountered many players.

2599
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:53,190
I'll tear my favorite woman.

2600
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:53,910
Thank you.

2601
02:10:55,070 --> 02:10:55,470
I think.

2602
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:58,650
I don't know.

2603
02:10:58,690 --> 02:11:00,070
I think Gavis Betel's my favorite woman.

2604
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,510
How's the mood feeling, Betel?

2605
02:11:09,610 --> 02:11:10,230
Are you feeling okay?

2606
02:11:10,350 --> 02:11:10,870
Yeah, feeling good?

2607
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:11,930
Are you feeling good?

2608
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:13,330
Yeah.

2609
02:11:16,150 --> 02:11:17,170
Are you sure about that?

2610
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:20,290
Fetel, fourth time to try.

2611
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:22,490
The first time that it would have been perfect.

2612
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:24,430
if we were succeeding in the first time.

2613
02:11:24,490 --> 02:11:25,610
We got a real bad spawn.

2614
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:27,310
Oh, this isn't it, guys.

2615
02:11:27,430 --> 02:11:29,090
It's 18 minutes in.

2616
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:31,090
And we got a bad spawn.

2617
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:32,390
Oh, no.

2618
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:33,330
No, it's fine.

2619
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:33,650
It's fine.

2620
02:11:33,850 --> 02:11:34,750
It can still work.

2621
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:37,090
Well, the gear still refresh itself.

2622
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:38,810
Do you want to improvise somewhere else?

2623
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:38,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2624
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:39,790
Let's improvise.

2625
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:42,270
It's all about improvisation.

2626
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:43,090
Improvision.

2627
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:44,510
Improvision.

2628
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:45,710
Improvision.

2629
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:51,450
Battle, why do you have so many health bars next to your
health bar?

2630
02:11:51,690 --> 02:11:52,490
Because I put on the head.

2631
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:57,450
be shield because I was getting ready for fucking goddamn
World War fucking 50.

2632
02:11:58,170 --> 02:12:00,390
The fourth time it'll be ready.

2633
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:06,380
I believe.

2634
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:07,620
I believe.

2635
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:10,160
Just think of all the loot we're gonna get when we succeed.

2636
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:10,940
Just think.

2637
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,100
We're gonna kill three guys with three loadouts.

2638
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:14,860
No, no.

2639
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,100
Three guys with all the loadout.

2640
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:17,780
No, no, no.

2641
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:19,260
This is it.

2642
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:20,520
Okay.

2643

I told you I can be heartless.

2667
02:14:35,170 --> 02:14:36,650
That felt good.

02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:39,850
With them, with them, with them, Toki.

2670
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:40,630
If you like how I said...

2671
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:41,190
Get someone outside.

2672
02:14:43,010 --> 02:14:43,270
Hello?

I said okay.

2676
02:14:54,050 --> 02:14:54,650
I need that.

2677
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:59,290
Alright, I got a lot of stuff.

2678
02:14:59,430 --> 02:14:59,770
There you go.

2679
02:14:59,810 --> 02:15:00,650
You can loot the rest.

2680
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:05,130
She thought I was going to rest here.

2681
02:15:06,850 --> 02:15:07,370
Evil.

2682
02:15:10,150 --> 02:15:11,270
There's people nearby.

2683
02:15:14,190 --> 02:15:14,930
Okay, you guys got...

2684
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:17,390
You guys need help out there?

2685
02:15:19,730 --> 02:15:20,770
Oh, Jesus.

2686
02:15:22,810 --> 02:15:25,130
I killed that guy too fast to give a shit.

2687
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:26,790
Yeah, you did.

2688
02:15:27,470 --> 02:15:27,750
Hello?

2689
02:15:29,890 --> 02:15:31,030
They're not restored.

2690
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:31,610
responding.

2691
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:35,730
I think if they see a dead body here, they're gonna know I'm
not friendly, guys.

2692
02:15:35,970 --> 02:15:37,150
They're gonna know.

2693
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:38,330
It doesn't disappear.

2694
02:15:38,650 --> 02:15:40,030
They're kind of behind that box.

2695
02:15:40,910 --> 02:15:41,750
I guess.

2696
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:43,430
That's your teammate that died.

2697
02:15:43,850 --> 02:15:45,030
Yeah, what if that's their teammate?

2698
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:48,770
No, she said, she said like all her teammates are dead.

2699
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:49,970
No, that's your teammate.

2700
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:51,130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2701
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:53,050
Oh, dad, you're cooking.

2702
02:15:53,190 --> 02:15:54,610
You're cooking right now.

2703
02:15:58,490 --> 02:16:00,490
You're gonna do a funeral for your teammate.

2704
02:16:01,630 --> 02:16:02,650
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

2705
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:06,050
I was like, oh, I'm just really sad because my teammate
died.

2706
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:09,810
Oh, I'll be like, oh, she had to go, so she, like, killed
herself.

2707
02:16:13,450 --> 02:16:14,270
Okay, okay.

02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:49,260
Go back to your spot.

2727
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:51,140
Go back to your spot again.

2728
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:52,900
Oh, a DeFi.

2729
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:54,220
Yeah, a DeFi.

2730
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:54,940
There's loot over here.

2731
02:17:55,580 --> 02:17:55,860
Yeah, yeah.

2732
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:57,580
I don't want to move.

2733
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:01,900
See, Ben, aren't you having fun now?

2734
02:18:02,420 --> 02:18:06,560
I like being the executioner of your fucking six sociopathic
plan.

2735
02:18:08,420 --> 02:18:10,800
person and then execute them.

2736
02:18:11,020 --> 02:18:12,340
Yeah, you like that?

2737
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:12,620
Yeah.

2738
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:14,400
Yeah.

2739
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:15,640
You guys are horrible.

2740
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:19,120
And for that, I'm turning on proximity chat.

2741
02:18:19,380 --> 02:18:20,040
Oh, wait, wait.

2742
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:23,700
Yeah, you should have, no, you should have turned what they
were saying, really.

2743
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:28,880
Well, it probably helps if the executioner doesn't hear what
they're saying, because I did not have a compass going up to

2744
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:29,440
that person.

2745
02:18:30,300 --> 02:18:32,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2746
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:33,320
Yeah, go.

2747
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,980
Yeah, hide here.

2748
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:39,360
I don't know how she died.

2749
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:40,460
How the fuck does she die?

2750
02:18:40,660 --> 02:18:42,400
We have 10 minutes before we have to get the fuck out of
here.

2751
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:44,020
Actually, we need to get out of here on, like, five.

2752
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:44,900
Plenty of time.

2753
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:45,300
Sure.

2754
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:46,960
Actually, we should just go now.

2755
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:48,300
Last extraction is over there.

2756
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:49,080
Yeah, let's just go now.

2757
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:49,660
Let's go now.

2758
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:50,200
Let's get out of here.

2759
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:50,340
Let's get out of here.

2760
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:53,300
We got two pieces of loot, guys.

2761
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:55,280
See?

2762
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:56,700
Improvise.

2763
02:18:56,900 --> 02:19:00,000
Even our honeypot plan changed, too.

2764
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:00,400
Uh-oh.

2765
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:02,240
It's women supporting women.

2766
02:19:07,630 --> 02:19:10,610
That person must have been so confused when a silent man
walked up behind.

2767
02:19:10,630 --> 02:19:14,150
person with dead teammates and executes them

2768
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:27,330
it's like the weirdest thing imaginable it was just unlucky
guys that it was two other female players okay guys it would

2769
02:19:27,330 --> 02:19:38,130
have worked out it would have been the same it would have
happened the same way no matter what oh no not again what

2770
02:19:38,130 --> 02:19:43,090
it's the fucking rocketeer again oh no Oh no, it's...

2771
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:44,490
There's something right above me.

2772
02:19:44,530 --> 02:19:45,110
Yeah, I see that.

2773
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:47,770
And I am not turning around.

2774
02:19:49,150 --> 02:19:49,370
Oh.

2775
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:52,330
Oh my god!

2776
02:19:52,590 --> 02:19:54,290
Oh, I went after me!

2777
02:19:55,330 --> 02:19:57,350
Why did you go after me?

2778
02:19:57,830 --> 02:19:58,910
Oh, because of what I did,

2779
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:03,330
No, no, that's...

2780
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:04,870
No, no, no, it's right.

2781
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:07,410
No, I did some fuck the shit just now.

2782
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:12,410
I did so fuck this shit.

2783
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,550
I'm distracting it.

2784
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:25,350
Not the karma gods If anything I'm surprised yo, you're
maxed up like I'm safe though, I think Oh, am I safe?

2785
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:33,610
Those things are impossible to run away from yeah, they are
how do you survive that better You just run inside but

2786
02:20:33,610 --> 02:20:35,750
there's nowhere to run so you're kind of just fucked.

2787
02:20:36,270 --> 02:20:39,230
Yeah Yeah, I was gonna say like, yeah, sorry.

2788
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:48,650
I wouldn't advise this better dude it's camping you yeah i
think you got can we not shoot it down it's gonna be tough

2789
02:20:52,350 --> 02:21:01,690
having good karma may help ah like ttt no i lived in the end
so i don't know i don't think that's true maybe the world

2790
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:07,790
truly is unfair sometimes i live still thanks dude like we
like if anything i'll tear someone that shouldn't have been

2791
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:13,030
shot down he did nothing The fact that Betta lives proves
that karma ain't real.

2792
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:16,530
He was the executioner.

2793
02:21:16,650 --> 02:21:17,110
That's Betta.

2794
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:17,950
That's Betta for you.

2795
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:20,230
He's like the fire of fate somehow.

2796
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:21,110
I don't know how he does that.

2797
02:21:21,130 --> 02:21:22,230
How do we go up?

2798
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:29,260
I have more bandages.

2799
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:31,440
Oh, God.

2800
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:32,040
Okay.

2801
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:35,120
Okay, there's people there.

2802
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:36,120
We send me in, okay?

2803
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:37,580
Okay.

2804
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:39,240
You guys don't, don't shoot.

2805
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:40,260
You send me in.

2806
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:41,600
You send me in like a fucking, like a torpedo.

2807
02:21:42,220 --> 02:21:42,500
Yeah.

2808
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:44,180
I got it.

2809
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,820
You gotta find a way to trap the people.

2810
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:47,940
The more I do this, the better I'm getting.

2811
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:48,920
I'm better I'm at.

2812
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:51,040
Oh, that's a good life skill.

2813
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:54,600
Yeah, you saw how, you saw that last group we, like, I let
them go.

2814
02:21:54,840 --> 02:22:00,280
Like, they were so convinced of how naive and innocent I
was, even though I actually don't know where the extraction

2815
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:00,920
point was.

2816
02:22:03,580 --> 02:22:05,200
You were technically telling the truth.

2817
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:08,420
So not only are you killing them, you're also wasting their
time.

2818
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:10,140
Yeah, I was wasting their time.

2819
02:22:10,220 --> 02:22:10,980
You guys like that?

2820
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:17,460
And see, guys, I told you guys, like...

2821
02:22:17,460 --> 02:22:18,980
Maybe Doki shouldn't be part of the guild.

2822
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:23,020
Guys, I told you guys that, like, people can be friendly
here.

2823
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:25,100
To me, of course.

2824
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:34,200
How does things still up?

2825
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:35,740
Oh, no.

2826
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:37,020
We didn't shoot the thrusters.

2827
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:42,220
Yeah, you got to shoot the back of it because the front is
blocked a little, so it's got to be harder to take down.

2828
02:22:47,780 --> 02:22:49,780
Oh wait, is it up now?

2829
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:52,560
Whoa.

2830
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:58,640
That thing is trying.

2831
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:00,840
It's one!

2832
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:04,500
Oh, it's opening.

2833
02:23:08,710 --> 02:23:10,010
Wait, it's shutting down.

2834
02:23:12,850 --> 02:23:13,650
No, that's not ours.

2835
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:14,190
That's not ours.

2836
02:23:14,470 --> 02:23:14,650
Oh, okay.

2837
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:15,190
Another one.

2838
02:23:15,890 --> 02:23:16,490
Let's go.

2839
02:23:17,010 --> 02:23:17,530
Let's leave that alone.

2840
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:36,510
50 guys we all made it yay we did it I told you four times
four times the charm four times the charm I told you we

2841
02:23:36,510 --> 02:23:46,430
improvised I told you guys look at that are you satisfied
now better yes I

2842
02:23:49,470 --> 02:23:50,410
Honestly, yes.

2843
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:51,690
She got the kill a little bit.

2844
02:23:51,830 --> 02:23:54,410
It brought me so much joy shooting that person on the ground
with him.

2845
02:23:55,010 --> 02:23:56,150
Oh, man, you should have heard it.

2846
02:23:56,230 --> 02:23:57,770
You should have heard those two.

2847
02:23:58,730 --> 02:24:01,530
They really thought we were going to pick them up, too.

2848
02:24:01,910 --> 02:24:02,230
They really...

2849
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:03,130
Yeah, that's fucked up.

2850
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:05,390
I didn't feel good about that.

2851
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:05,950
They...

2852
02:24:05,950 --> 02:24:07,230
I smell amazing.

2853
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:09,090
Oh, no.

2854
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:11,070
Oh, no.

2855
02:24:19,850 --> 02:24:20,950
All right, I'm ready.

2856
02:24:21,250 --> 02:24:21,470
I'm ready.

2857
02:24:21,610 --> 02:24:22,190
I love this game.

2858
02:24:23,530 --> 02:24:23,550
Huh?

2859
02:24:24,130 --> 02:24:25,070
New destination available.

2860
02:24:25,970 --> 02:24:26,630
Blue gate, yeah.

2861
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:28,470
A good one.

2862
02:24:29,110 --> 02:24:29,270
Okay.

2863
02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:33,310
That's a good one for when we actually want to play the game
instead of social experiments.

2864
02:24:33,510 --> 02:24:34,830
Wait, not enough space in your stash.

2865
02:24:34,990 --> 02:24:35,910
Manage your inventory.

2866
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:37,630
Oh, I have too much items now.

2867
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:40,570
So you can expand your stash with money.

2868
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:41,890
Oh, do I have money?

2869
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:44,750
See how much money I have.

2870
02:24:44,750 --> 02:24:46,690
I have 5,000.

2871
02:24:47,390 --> 02:24:48,910
You might be able to expand it once.

2872
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:49,430
Yay!

2873
02:24:49,530 --> 02:24:50,510
All right, I'm ready.

2874
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:52,330
Reload out.

2875
02:24:52,490 --> 02:24:52,850
Let's go.

2876
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:54,630
Get one second.

2877
02:24:54,950 --> 02:24:55,890
No karma, too.

2878
02:24:56,050 --> 02:24:57,150
Look at that, guys.

2879
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:58,170
No karma.

2880
02:24:58,750 --> 02:24:59,550
No karma.

2881
02:24:59,670 --> 02:25:00,770
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

2882
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:04,470
I got finished a stream and get hit by a bus.

2883
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:11,590
I was like, okay, Beto, you can do it.

2884
02:25:13,930 --> 02:25:17,090
After I told her, like, yeah, I'll pick you up.

2885
02:25:18,970 --> 02:25:19,350
Damn.

2886
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:31,710
I can't repair this Okay Good to go, sorry I think that
person Must have been so confused when they saw it When I

2887
02:25:31,710 --> 02:25:37,850
said like, oh I'm just helping my friend pick up her loot
And then she saw three of us walk out And you're like Wait,

2888
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:47,510
I thought your friend was gone You're evil Do it The thing,
we had like four Defibs, so we could have picked everybody

2889
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:52,150
up Yeah, but we got to We can't look at that statistic, my
friend.

2890
02:25:53,690 --> 02:25:58,550
If we used that DFib, we would have had three DFibs out
there.

2891
02:25:58,690 --> 02:26:00,970
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

2892
02:26:01,090 --> 02:26:01,750
You're right.

2893
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:02,410
You're right.

2894
02:26:02,670 --> 02:26:03,670
Women are always right.

2895
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:09,170
It's like Betel is the person.

2896
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:12,110
Doki is the devil on the shoulder.

2897
02:26:12,350 --> 02:26:13,210

02:26:32,430 --> 02:26:33,710
He's like Adam.

2913
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:37,770
I'm Adam.

2914
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:39,470

02:27:27,810 --> 02:27:29,810
It actually makes much sense that we just, yeah, I mean,

2934
02:27:29,930 --> 02:27:30,890
We don't have to do it.

02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:41,730
I think it's pretty early into the round, 28 minutes.

2942
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:42,550
I mean, we're here.

2943
02:27:42,690 --> 02:27:46,050

02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:51,850
He's chasing that high again.

02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:53,950
He's chasing the high.

2947
02:27:55,550 --> 02:27:55,950
Fertilizer.

2948
02:27:56,770 --> 02:28:00,510

This is the one time.

2994
02:32:31,930 --> 02:32:41,010
inside and it's like specifically they circled the map the
area and on the map too yeah they made a reddit post about

2995
02:32:41,010 --> 02:32:50,070

that no one is we can dip wait wait i'll we'll wait two more

2998
02:33:11,430 --> 02:33:24,850
to the east and the south i'm with i'll tire here or or we
could after two minutes we improvise again improvising was

2999
02:33:24,850 --> 02:33:32,210
pretty good i really want to breach this and search it but
someone was like you're not even looting it's because we

3000
02:33:32,210 --> 02:33:39,770
have to keep it yeah i have to make the illusion that i just
started looting this place so they'll go deeper in all right

3001
02:33:39,770 --> 02:33:48,750
don't worry we have one minute left that's crazy i i think i
will I'm pretty sure the Reddit, there is a Reddit post

3002
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:49,510
about just now.

3003
02:33:53,930 --> 02:34:01,330
I'm starting to believe the Reddit post because it's crazy
that we've been here for like six minutes or eight minutes

3004
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,850
and nobody showed up.

3005
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:03,610
Eight minutes?

3006
02:34:03,770 --> 02:34:08,410
Yeah, this is like every time someone has showed up, nobody
has showed up this time.

3007
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:12,830
No, you don't say I'm friendly.

3008
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:14,210
You say, are you guys friendly?

3009
02:34:14,350 --> 02:34:15,870
Because I'm friendly is more suspicious.

that's true yes see see that's how you gaslight people oh my
god there's a rocketeer right above us there's two

us to this place battle it's the best spot to hide wait so

3012
02:34:39,750 --> 02:34:45,830
like what's a dead lobby well it's not dead lobby It's just
like people are just avoiding this spot because it's just

3013
02:34:45,830 --> 02:34:46,530
random.

02:34:46,770 --> 02:34:50,070

02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:17,330
God damn it.

3058
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:20,050
Of course it suits me.

3059
02:36:20,270 --> 02:36:20,850
Wait, wait, wait.

3060
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:21,290
Hello?

3061
02:36:22,890 --> 02:36:24,350
Oh my god, wait, they're not coming in.

3062
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:25,010
I'm scared.

3063
02:36:27,650 --> 02:36:28,370
They're finding Ark.

3064
02:36:29,070 --> 02:36:30,270
Oh, wait, I'll help them.

3065
02:36:30,510 --> 02:36:31,430
He was right at the door.

3066
02:36:31,890 --> 02:36:33,230
You guys need help outside?

3067
02:36:37,010 --> 02:36:37,370
Oh.

3068
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:39,310

3069
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:39,590
Oh.

3070
02:36:42,990 --> 02:36:43,510
Hello?

3071
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:48,440
Oh, here's another...

3072
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:50,180
There's two more arcs outside.

3073
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,040
Do you guys need help?

3074
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:53,940
They're not saying anything.

3075
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:55,560
They said something in this stop.

3076
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:57,440
What the fuck?

3077
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:59,200
They probably read this Reddit post.

3078
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,540
I think they're gonna shoot me, guys.

3079
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:03,740
They don't seem very close.

3080
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:05,720
They are?

3081
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:06,840
Oh, no, they're not.

3082
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:09,600
They were at this entrance right here.

3083
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:10,380
We're going to go to the domes.

3084
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:14,060
You guys need help?

3085
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:16,220
There's someone inside.

3086
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:17,380
Someone inside.

3087
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:19,560
Are you guys friendly?

3088
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:22,640
Your friend?

3089
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:22,880

3091
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,660
Go to him.

3092
02:37:25,860 --> 02:37:27,140
Sorry, I can't hear you.

3093
02:37:27,240 --> 02:37:28,040
You're up, dude.

3094
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:30,560

3095
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:32,260
Sorry, I can't hear you.

3096
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:33,660
Don't crack.

3097
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:34,660
Don't crack.

3098
02:37:34,860 --> 02:37:35,600
I'm not cracking.

3099
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:36,740
I'm pretending.

3100
02:37:37,140 --> 02:37:37,760
I'm scared.

3101
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:39,500
I'm scared they're gonna shoot me.

3102
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:40,240
No.

3103
02:37:40,980 --> 02:37:41,880
They're never gonna shoot you.

3104
02:37:42,060 --> 02:37:42,680
That's cute.

3105
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:45,240
You'd be like, hello?

3106
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:47,500
Hello?

3107
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:49,000
Where did he go?

3108
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:49,500
Did he leave?

3109
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:50,260
I don't know.

3110
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:51,340
Wait, I think he left.

3111
02:37:54,080 --> 02:37:55,260
Yeah, I think he left.

3112
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:56,560
Bro, that guy's gone.

3113
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:58,920
That guy's gone, gone.

3114
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:00,900
Well.

3115
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:02,300
All right, back to looting.

3116
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:06,340
Back to looting.

3117
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:07,880
That guy left.

3118
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:11,040
Bro, what the fuck?

3119
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:11,960
He was like, you...

3120
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:13,340
That guy was a pussy.

3121
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:15,880
He didn't fall for the bait.

3122
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:17,540
We saw 18 minutes left.

3123
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:19,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3124
02:38:20,140 --> 02:38:21,640
They're like, fuck that shit.

3125
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:24,980
This is a trap right here.

3126
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:27,960
Some bullshit.

3127
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:29,340

3128
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,760

That was like those guys were my people.

3362

We killed my people.

3363
02:50:42,310 --> 02:50:46,090
Those guys were like- They're never gonna trust people again
because of you.

3364
02:50:46,090 --> 02:50:46,830
Those were good people.

3365
02:50:47,450 --> 02:50:49,910
They're gonna start hating the birthday every single time.

This gives me so much joy.

3451
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:20,240
Like, I'm not here to play the actual gun game here.

3452
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:21,980
You want to play the psychological game?

3453
02:56:22,180 --> 02:56:24,480
Yeah, I'm here for the psychological warfare.

3454
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:26,120
That is fun.

3455
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:26,860
Yeah.

3456
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:31,440
Let's go!

3457
02:56:34,540 --> 02:56:35,500
Look at the squad.

3458
02:56:39,220 --> 02:56:39,620
RGPB.

3459
02:56:44,200 --> 02:56:44,600
Regis.

3460
02:56:45,140 --> 02:56:45,520
Gavis.

3461
02:56:45,780 --> 02:56:47,780
I wonder what happened to their third guy.

3462
02:56:48,680 --> 02:56:49,480
They got...

3463
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:52,260
Do we, like, merge with Solos, or is just all three stacks?

3464
02:56:55,020 --> 02:56:56,060
Always with three stacks.

3465
02:56:56,800 --> 02:56:58,480
Oh, their third guy died somewhere.

3466
02:57:00,120 --> 02:57:01,780
Because we only had to witness that one, too.

3467
02:57:02,380 --> 02:57:03,260
No, we just had to kill it.

3468
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:04,820
We killed two because their third guy didn't show up.

3469
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:14,320
up maybe because i believe it's always with three it used to
be like with a mixture but they changed it yeah so like

3470
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:20,840
because i was like where was their third guy maybe the third
guy was so paranoid about us like he died probably oh yeah

3471
02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:28,160
or he died i'm thinking i think he just died because like
why wouldn't he sing the birthday song with us maybe maybe

3472
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:35,560
well yeah maybe oh apparently dude oh dooku is bugged it
right now or something oh yeah so like Sometimes the duo

3473
02:57:35,560 --> 02:57:36,280
queue comes in.

3474
02:57:36,280 --> 02:57:36,960
I love the guy.

3475
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,900
You know, that guy, the guy that's like, I hope your
birthday sucks.

3476
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:42,180
That one was, I love that part.

3477
02:57:42,620 --> 02:57:43,880
Chad, did you even hear that?

3478
02:57:44,480 --> 02:57:45,400
You got a fun one.

3479
02:57:45,500 --> 02:57:46,660
The other guy just cursed at me.

3480
02:57:47,240 --> 02:57:47,880
Oh, shit.

3481
02:57:48,980 --> 02:57:50,520
The other guy just said, F you.

3482
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:53,940
The fact that they still thought it.

3483
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:54,500
Rightfully so.

3484
02:57:54,940 --> 02:57:59,960
I mean, the fact that they even believed the lie that it was
your birthday to after we killed them.

3485
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:00,740
Happy birthday.

3486
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:07,060
That was pure evil.

3487
02:58:07,400 --> 02:58:08,820
That was the worst thing today.

3488
02:58:11,380 --> 02:58:12,340
So far.

3489
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:21,830
I'm gonna...

3490
02:58:21,830 --> 02:58:23,270
Okay, now it's my turn for fun.

3491
02:58:23,710 --> 02:58:24,790
What's your turn for fun?

3492
02:58:25,650 --> 02:58:26,730
We're gonna kill everyone.

3493
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:31,410
The most evil thing we've done so far.

3494
02:58:33,050 --> 02:58:34,670
In fact, probably the most passive and regular.

3495
02:58:36,510 --> 02:58:37,930
At least I didn't emotionally toy with them.

3496
02:58:38,730 --> 02:58:41,130
I realize why people are like, don't shoot, don't shoot.

3497
02:58:41,250 --> 02:58:42,050
And they just start shooting.

3498
02:58:42,290 --> 02:58:46,230
But, like, I take it another level.

3499
02:58:46,850 --> 02:58:48,890
It's like people who finally play Shaco and League of
Legends.

3500
02:58:49,110 --> 02:58:50,810
I build an entire lore.

3501
02:58:52,430 --> 02:58:54,630
An entire story behind it.

3502
02:58:55,170 --> 02:58:56,430
We've been streaming this, too.

3503
02:58:56,490 --> 02:58:57,970
And everybody saw our shame.

3504
02:58:58,790 --> 02:59:00,630
Yeah, I'm adding roleplay to it.

3505
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:02,790
It makes it more believable.

3506
02:59:03,390 --> 02:59:06,190
Happy birthday to you.

3507
02:59:07,490 --> 02:59:26,870
Happy birthday dear Michael Michael Gorgias This is a hot
song Oh shit Whoa whoa whoa oh no she didn't wait wait wait

friendly guys They were absolutely not friendly They were

3509
02:59:34,850 --> 02:59:37,110
not friendly It was a bye.

3510
02:59:37,190 --> 02:59:39,370
I should have been executed you.

3511
02:59:39,810 --> 02:59:40,970
Yeah, no, I left.

3512
02:59:43,150 --> 02:59:46,290
I had no actual loot, so I'm fine.

3513
02:59:47,630 --> 02:59:48,910
Oh, that guy crouched.

3514
02:59:49,310 --> 02:59:50,190
Oh, he slid.

3515
02:59:50,330 --> 02:59:51,970
Guys, this was a real game.

3516
02:59:53,210 --> 02:59:54,010
I died.

3517
02:59:55,230 --> 02:59:55,750
Karma.

3518
02:59:56,030 --> 02:59:58,610
Guys, it's not karma when it was free loot, guys.

3519
02:59:59,050 --> 03:00:00,630
I didn't bring actual loot.

3520
03:00:04,550 --> 03:00:06,090
Oh my god, he's doing it.

3521
03:00:06,190 --> 03:00:08,010
Oh, yeah.

3522
03:00:10,710 --> 03:00:11,390
Okay.

3523
03:00:11,930 --> 03:00:12,730
Oh my god, he's fracking.

3524
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:15,610
He's fracking.

3525
03:00:16,110 --> 03:00:16,510
No!

3526
03:00:17,190 --> 03:00:19,130
You were so close!

3527
03:00:21,430 --> 03:00:21,870
Goodbye, Michael.

3528
03:00:22,090 --> 03:00:23,570
Wait, those are peanuts men?

3529
03:00:24,490 --> 03:00:25,050
Say it your birthday.

3530
03:00:25,130 --> 03:00:25,650
Say it your birthday.

3531
03:00:26,330 --> 03:00:26,790
Oh.

3532
03:00:28,790 --> 03:00:29,490
Damn.

3533
03:00:30,190 --> 03:00:30,750
Oh!

3534
03:00:31,530 --> 03:00:34,970
Oh, we accidentally walked into the war zone.

3535
03:00:35,490 --> 03:00:35,790
Bro!

3536
03:00:36,190 --> 03:00:41,310
This was apparently the fucking area where everyone is
fighting, bro.

3537
03:00:41,390 --> 03:00:42,150
That's the war zone?

3538
03:00:42,430 --> 03:00:44,370
This was the war zone.

3539
03:00:45,130 --> 03:00:46,210
We just actually...

3540
03:00:46,210 --> 03:00:47,130
You took us to war!

3541
03:00:47,310 --> 03:00:50,510
Bro, he took us to the streamer war zone.

3542
03:00:51,270 --> 03:00:54,050
Is there an area where they do, like, they fight?

3543
03:00:54,370 --> 03:00:58,410
Yeah, apparently, my chat was like, bro, that was the war
zone.

3544
03:00:58,810 --> 03:01:00,910
Okay, but what if we were that birthday over there, too?

3545
03:01:02,570 --> 03:01:05,810
They actually think we were, like, the other side.

3546
03:01:06,190 --> 03:01:17,550
yeah yeah so i was like that was the whatever the bunta
later whatever it's called it's a big war between two big

3547
03:01:17,550 --> 03:01:27,370
claims yeah i was like why aren't they talking yeah they
don't give a those are those are war men yeah i got that's

3548
03:01:27,370 --> 03:01:37,950
one of the yeah we actually literally stumbled on it yeah no
civilians in the war zone guys want to do another i see we

3549
03:01:37,950 --> 03:01:44,390
do it that was that doesn't count that doesn't count okay
that one was like an actual war zone that we actually

3550
03:01:44,390 --> 03:01:50,770

go back and just join i was really just supposed to go

3551
03:01:50,770 --> 03:02:05,750
around they definitely did not care about your birthday
that's for sure they they were going nuts But I don't know

3552
03:02:05,750 --> 03:02:06,950
what's the faction uniforms.

3553
03:02:07,370 --> 03:02:11,190
We don't know what the uniforms are, so we each are one of
the colors just in case.

3554
03:02:12,390 --> 03:02:13,150
Oh, so all die.

3555
03:02:13,790 --> 03:02:16,450
I think we're all, I think the only one wearing the right
uniform.

3556
03:02:16,630 --> 03:02:20,170
I think Altair is wearing a uniform of one of the factions.

3557
03:02:21,250 --> 03:02:21,290
Oh.

3558
03:02:22,690 --> 03:02:23,410
Uh-oh.

3559
03:02:23,710 --> 03:02:24,770
I'm pretty sure.

3560
03:02:25,550 --> 03:02:26,850
So they saw Altair.

3561
03:02:27,270 --> 03:02:28,570
I am the owner of the faction.

3562
03:02:29,010 --> 03:02:29,650
Dun, dun, dun.

3563
03:02:30,650 --> 03:02:37,390
all right this is lg as long as we didn't stumble into the
war zone okay we were literally like we were like

3564
03:02:37,390 --> 03:02:42,370

I don't fucking know what I'm doing.

3569
03:02:58,970 --> 03:02:59,790
Grab your ammo.

3570
03:03:00,130 --> 03:03:00,850
It's a three hours, Doki.

3571
03:03:01,470 --> 03:03:02,670
Oh, what was the gun?

3572
03:03:02,790 --> 03:03:03,350
The yellow ammo.

3573
03:03:03,470 --> 03:03:03,850
The yellow?

3574
03:03:04,030 --> 03:03:04,270
Okay.

3575
03:03:04,570 --> 03:03:04,830
Yeah.

3576
03:03:04,930 --> 03:03:06,730
Yellow gun for a yellow Doki.

3577
03:03:08,750 --> 03:03:09,270
Yellow.

3578
03:03:09,450 --> 03:03:10,830
What do Doki birds eat?

3579
03:03:12,270 --> 03:03:12,750
Food.

3580
03:03:13,210 --> 03:03:13,590
Food.

3581
03:03:13,770 --> 03:03:14,190
I knew it.

3582
03:03:14,310 --> 03:03:14,670
I knew it.

3583
03:03:15,770 --> 03:03:16,370
I'm sorry.

3584
03:03:16,530 --> 03:03:17,070
I even asked.

3585
03:03:17,750 --> 03:03:18,710
I'm trying to make conversation.

3586
03:03:19,530 --> 03:03:21,390
I am having a conversation.

3587
03:03:21,410 --> 03:03:23,950
Is that answer not good enough for you?

3588
03:03:24,270 --> 03:03:25,330
Oh, I'm sorry.

3589
03:03:26,410 --> 03:03:29,290
I gotta save my head for the rope there.

3590
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:29,950
It isn't.

3591
03:03:30,050 --> 03:03:31,230
No, it's not good enough.

3592
03:03:31,570 --> 03:03:34,370
You asked the most fucking basic question ever.

3593
03:03:34,790 --> 03:03:35,330
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3594
03:03:35,470 --> 03:03:35,950
Okay, fine then.

3595
03:03:36,250 --> 03:03:38,590
It's like asking me how- What is the circumference of your
left nostril?

3596
03:03:38,650 --> 03:03:41,410
It's like asking me like, how's the weather up there?

3597
03:03:41,610 --> 03:03:41,990
You know?

3598
03:03:42,690 --> 03:03:43,810
How's the weather down there?

3599
03:03:44,270 --> 03:03:45,330
Oh yeah, fuck you.

3600
03:03:48,370 --> 03:03:50,270
I hope you get killed first.

3601
03:03:55,700 --> 03:03:56,060
Wee!

3602
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:56,920
Wee!

3603
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:59,760
Doki, are you a girl, a tomato, or a bird?

3604
03:04:00,440 --> 03:04:02,140
Let's go do the- I could be both.

3605
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:05,560

Well, we can go there as warriors.

3609
03:04:12,340 --> 03:04:13,240
Guys, is this a war zone?

3610
03:04:13,640 --> 03:04:14,060
Oh yeah, okay.

03:04:57,760 --> 03:04:59,300
I know where the control tower is.

3624
03:04:59,320 --> 03:05:00,400
Do you have a key for it or?

3625
03:05:00,600 --> 03:05:03,560
No, they said the control tower is one of the war zones.

3626
03:05:03,940 --> 03:05:05,360
Oh, yeah, that place is a shit show.

3627
03:05:05,460 --> 03:05:06,860
We could go there, but...

3628
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:09,440
No, they said that's where the streamer wars are.

3629
03:05:10,220 --> 03:05:13,880
Okay, yeah, that's where we were earlier, like, outside of
the control tower.

3630
03:05:14,380 --> 03:05:14,400
So...

3654
03:06:49,800 --> 03:06:50,960

Oh, okay.

What if it's my birthday?

3659
03:07:04,540 --> 03:07:04,900
Killer.

Oh, that's messed up, bro.

3661
03:07:08,360 --> 03:07:10,220
No, that's messed up.

3662
03:07:11,460 --> 03:07:12,700
You can do it to me on my birthday.

3663
03:07:12,920 --> 03:07:13,620
I would never.

3664
03:07:15,080 --> 03:07:16,080
I would never.

3665
03:07:21,800 --> 03:07:30,500
what is that i don't even know what's good in here like i
don't even know what i'm holding on to at this point yeah

3666
03:07:30,500 --> 03:07:42,220
for when you're starting off just pick the pretty colors
blue better than green okay i can repair shields let's go uh

3667
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:46,660
blue i'll get rid of all the greens then You could probably
keep them.

3668
03:07:47,580 --> 03:07:50,320
But if you find more blues, you can always replace it.

3669
03:07:50,660 --> 03:07:51,180
Oh, I see.

3670
03:07:52,580 --> 03:07:57,480
I mean, that's not usually the rule of thumb, but just for
like right now in time, you may as well just get the best

3671
03:07:57,480 --> 03:07:57,760
stuff.

3672
03:07:59,560 --> 03:08:01,040
You're not supposed to say this place again.

3673
03:08:01,180 --> 03:08:02,920
You're supposed to say, oh yeah, this place again.

3674
03:08:03,580 --> 03:08:03,620
Yeah.

3675
03:08:04,620 --> 03:08:05,960
Not in a bad way, in a good way.

3676
03:08:06,160 --> 03:08:06,920
Oh, I should have got the ammo.

3677
03:08:07,060 --> 03:08:07,440
Oh, well.

3678
03:08:07,840 --> 03:08:08,840
I don't need the ammo.

3679
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:12,040
I have 56, 59 bullets.

3680
03:08:12,160 --> 03:08:12,960
That's all I need.

3681
03:08:14,680 --> 03:08:17,800
I'm gonna have trauma on that little hill where we murdered
those men.

3682
03:08:17,820 --> 03:08:20,260

Wait, we can help this guy.

3718

Where are we helping?

3720
03:11:21,560 --> 03:11:22,080

I'll let you know they're pushing.

3729
03:11:37,900 --> 03:11:39,300
They're taking an awful angle to the left.

03:11:39,660 --> 03:11:40,700
He's going behind the building.

Okay.

Oh, he got you up.

03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:48,420

Overwatch.

03:15:17,650 --> 03:15:19,110
I need some light ammo.

3785
03:15:19,230 --> 03:15:19,610
One second.

3786
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:23,920
I'm ready.

3787
03:15:24,020 --> 03:15:25,760
I got natural loadout now.

3788
03:15:26,880 --> 03:15:27,180
All right.

3789
03:15:27,760 --> 03:15:37,840
let me just make a couple of things this is fun though guys
yeah i see this game so far i get the hype except for the

3790
03:15:37,840 --> 03:15:50,540
arc part i get the hype the interaction's been fun uh okay
almost done sorry sorry okay we're going to the map with the

3791
03:15:50,540 --> 03:15:57,540
most arc on it but it's more open so it's a little less hell
but what did we just say we hated the arcs yeah i like i

3792
03:15:57,540 --> 03:16:05,160
like this map it's more open it's it it has more arc but
it's a little it feels a bit better oh i see you know i

3793
03:16:05,160 --> 03:16:11,880
might be worried for saying this but i actually like better
than pvp how do you upgrade your gun better how do we

3794
03:16:11,880 --> 03:16:17,620
upgrade you can just you can just right click it and there's
an upgrade option and you just need the materials that it

3795
03:16:17,620 --> 03:16:20,460
asks for oh i could have done that oops

3796
03:16:24,760 --> 03:16:36,270
oopsie i was like the arc part is great but you can damage
people yeah but for some reason um the finds us first before

3797
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:38,070
we can even do that.

3798
03:16:41,320 --> 03:16:41,800
Oik.

3799
03:16:43,520 --> 03:16:44,000
Okay.

3800
03:16:44,660 --> 03:16:45,480
All right, for real.

3801
03:16:46,460 --> 03:16:48,980
This is a real open map, but it's my favorite.

3802
03:16:49,620 --> 03:16:49,920
Uh-huh.

3803
03:16:53,630 --> 03:16:55,190

3806
03:17:01,590 --> 03:17:03,690
I called it the big SSD, and now it's full.

3807
03:17:03,930 --> 03:17:06,090

3853
03:20:13,770 --> 03:20:14,070

point in watching this series finale?

3855
03:20:22,610 --> 03:20:24,630
Well, it's about what drives him to want the lemonade.

3856
03:20:24,750 --> 03:20:25,010
You know what?

3857
03:20:25,030 --> 03:20:25,530

lemonade and then it just doesn't the payout is just not

3861
03:20:36,270 --> 03:20:41,050
doesn't feel the same now that you know it maybe we're
waiting for the character arc where he buys the lemonade

3862
03:20:41,050 --> 03:20:48,370
stand no now it's over the creator said he ain't making no

03:22:51,060 --> 03:22:51,480
Or four.

3899
03:22:53,140 --> 03:22:55,040
Yeah, we are siphoning Beto's luck.

3900
03:22:57,280 --> 03:22:58,860
We're taking all his luck.

3901
03:22:59,720 --> 03:23:00,980
Guys, there's someone on the bell tower.

3902
03:23:01,080 --> 03:23:01,560
On the bell.

3903
03:23:01,700 --> 03:23:02,200
Actually, okay.

3904
03:23:02,840 --> 03:23:04,180
He's headshot, I think.

3905
03:23:05,400 --> 03:23:06,060
I'm looking.

3906
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:07,360
I don't have a scope on it.

3907
03:23:07,620 --> 03:23:08,380
Yeah, he was up here.

3908
03:23:08,480 --> 03:23:10,220
He probably went down the ladder.

3909
03:23:10,440 --> 03:23:10,900
Yeah, yeah.

3910
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:12,080
Yeah, he's down there.

3911
03:23:13,860 --> 03:23:14,220
What?

3912
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:15,840
What?

3913
03:23:16,280 --> 03:23:17,240
I fell through the floor.

3914
03:23:17,640 --> 03:23:18,300
Are you kidding me?

3915
03:23:18,360 --> 03:23:19,480
Like a cross, you're saying?

3916
03:23:20,420 --> 03:23:21,280
Like, were I pinged?

3917
03:23:21,420 --> 03:23:22,280
That's where he was.

3918
03:23:22,620 --> 03:23:23,060
Are you talking?

3919
03:23:23,160 --> 03:23:23,400
Okay.

3920
03:23:23,500 --> 03:23:25,160
He went east side somewhere.

3921
03:23:26,400 --> 03:23:27,340
Yeah, I think he ran.

3922
03:23:27,820 --> 03:23:28,120
Man.

3923
03:23:28,440 --> 03:23:29,300
Bro, you fell?

3924
03:23:29,900 --> 03:23:30,720
I fell through the floor.

3925
03:23:31,020 --> 03:23:31,380
Bro.

3926
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:33,060
I took all my health damage.

3927
03:23:33,420 --> 03:23:33,720
I know.

3928
03:23:34,520 --> 03:23:34,880
Bro.

3929
03:23:38,900 --> 03:23:41,300

how the fuck unintentionally

3932
03:24:09,270 --> 03:24:11,950
Due to a glitch in the system, the glitch in the algorithm.

3933
03:24:13,190 --> 03:24:14,070
There's people down this way.

3934
03:24:15,030 --> 03:24:15,790
You want to head over there?

3935
03:24:17,730 --> 03:24:18,530
We can.

3936
03:24:21,810 --> 03:24:22,190
Oh?

3937
03:24:22,870 --> 03:24:23,270
Oh?

3938
03:24:23,550 --> 03:24:24,310
What is it?

3939
03:24:25,530 --> 03:24:27,030
Oh, there's a ladder here.

3940
03:24:28,310 --> 03:24:29,010
Oh, that's how you go up.

3941
03:24:29,310 --> 03:24:29,870
Oh, shit.

3942
03:24:30,330 --> 03:24:31,210
I fell off.

3943
03:24:31,450 --> 03:24:32,610
Oh, guys.

3944
03:24:32,810 --> 03:24:33,410
It scared me.

3945
03:24:33,450 --> 03:24:34,490
Guys, we are...

3946
03:24:35,310 --> 03:24:35,710
Guys.

3947
03:24:36,230 --> 03:24:39,250
The boys and the masculine urge just to break our legs in a
fall.

3948
03:24:39,270 --> 03:24:41,350
and bleed out silently.

3949
03:24:42,610 --> 03:24:43,850
Yes, the masculine urge.

3950
03:24:46,730 --> 03:24:47,870
There's a guy in front of me.

3951
03:24:48,050 --> 03:24:50,350
Ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.

3952
03:24:50,870 --> 03:24:51,690
He's in front of me.

3953
03:24:51,890 --> 03:24:53,030
Like, actually, it was just in front of me.

3954
03:24:53,210 --> 03:24:54,230
I got hit by my hand.

3955
03:24:54,430 --> 03:24:55,370
I don't know where in front of you.

3956
03:24:55,570 --> 03:24:56,270
I got hit by my hand.

3957
03:24:56,770 --> 03:24:57,630
But where's the other guy?

3958
03:24:57,670 --> 03:24:58,050
Where's the other guy?

3959
03:24:59,630 --> 03:25:00,850
Okay, chat race, chat race, or not.

3960
03:25:00,890 --> 03:25:01,910
Oh, my gosh, I'm getting shot too.

3961
03:25:03,270 --> 03:25:04,150
I can't see it.

3962
03:25:04,350 --> 03:25:05,330
Oh, I think I'm safe, yes.

3963
03:25:06,650 --> 03:25:08,270
I'm going to, it's just last guy, right?

3964
03:25:09,290 --> 03:25:09,930
Not sure.

3965
03:25:10,770 --> 03:25:12,250
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise.

3966
03:25:13,330 --> 03:25:13,550
Okay.

3967
03:25:13,710 --> 03:25:14,230
Thank you.

3968
03:25:16,150 --> 03:25:17,010
To cover us.

3969
03:25:17,030 --> 03:25:17,770
That was one of the...

3970
03:25:17,770 --> 03:25:19,790
Because I know we res did another guy already.

3971
03:25:20,410 --> 03:25:21,270
I mean, we knocked him one.

3972
03:25:21,870 --> 03:25:24,130
Okay, I'm gonna check where the other guy went down.

3973
03:25:24,990 --> 03:25:25,270
Hello?

3974
03:25:25,410 --> 03:25:25,790
There's multiple.

3975
03:25:25,930 --> 03:25:26,270
There's multiple.

3976
03:25:26,450 --> 03:25:26,610
There's multiple.

3977
03:25:27,090 --> 03:25:27,830
That's stuff from him.

3978
03:25:29,770 --> 03:25:30,970
I don't know where I knocked him.

3979
03:25:31,650 --> 03:25:32,310
I'm going over the...

3980
03:25:32,790 --> 03:25:33,170
He's on me.

3981
03:25:33,210 --> 03:25:33,430
He's on me.

3982
03:25:33,430 --> 03:25:33,830
He's on me.

3983
03:25:33,990 --> 03:25:34,450
I'm looking.

3984
03:25:34,910 --> 03:25:37,670
I'm looking at the smoke, but I don't see anybody.

3985
03:25:37,990 --> 03:25:38,390
I'm watching.

3986
03:25:38,510 --> 03:25:38,690
I'm watching.

3987
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:45,780
Where did that guy go?

3988
03:25:46,060 --> 03:25:46,440
Oh no.

3989
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:46,740
Oh!

3990
03:25:47,620 --> 03:25:48,140
Tree in front of me!

3991
03:25:48,180 --> 03:25:48,240
Tree!

3992
03:25:49,200 --> 03:25:49,380
Okay.

3993
03:25:51,360 --> 03:25:52,360
He's like prone or something.

3994
03:25:52,820 --> 03:25:53,940
You getting prone in this game?

3995
03:25:54,640 --> 03:25:55,300
No, no, no, no, no.

3996
03:25:55,360 --> 03:25:55,960
He's just...

3997
03:25:55,960 --> 03:25:56,360
He's hurt.

3998
03:25:56,460 --> 03:25:56,740
He's hurt.

3999
03:25:56,920 --> 03:25:57,100
He's hurt.

4000
03:25:59,200 --> 03:25:59,740
He's down.

4001
03:26:00,280 --> 03:26:00,600
Nice.

4002
03:26:00,640 --> 03:26:01,980
Probably one more.

4003
03:26:02,440 --> 03:26:02,700
Not me.

4004
03:26:03,440 --> 03:26:04,080
He's broken.

4005
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:06,240
He's hit.

4006
03:26:06,340 --> 03:26:06,500
He's hit.

4007
03:26:06,620 --> 03:26:06,800
He's hit.

4008
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:07,420
Nice, nice.

4009
03:26:08,200 --> 03:26:09,080
I'm gonna thirst this guy.

4010
03:26:09,380 --> 03:26:09,660
Oh, you're nice.

4011
03:26:09,900 --> 03:26:10,140
Yeah, yeah.

4012
03:26:10,200 --> 03:26:10,560
He's running.

4013
03:26:15,920 --> 03:26:17,320
Oh, you guys should meet up.

4014
03:26:17,620 --> 03:26:17,980
Any shields?

4015
03:26:18,900 --> 03:26:20,560
I have shields on me.

4016
03:26:20,660 --> 03:26:21,960
You guys need...

4017
03:26:21,960 --> 03:26:22,880
That guy had bandages.

4018
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:23,260
We're good.

4019
03:26:24,600 --> 03:26:25,260
Thank you.

4020
03:26:28,820 --> 03:26:29,340
I'm just going to...

4021
03:26:29,340 --> 03:26:30,000
Is the drone coming up?

4022
03:26:30,180 --> 03:26:31,920
Yeah, I'm going to heal up fully then.

4023
03:26:33,880 --> 03:26:34,560
Good job, guys.

4024
03:26:35,080 --> 03:26:35,380
Yeah.

4025
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:40,260
How are you dealing?

4026
03:26:42,200 --> 03:26:42,960
What am I hearing?

4027
03:26:43,100 --> 03:26:43,820
Is that the rocketeer?

4028
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:44,600
I think that's...

4029
03:26:44,600 --> 03:26:45,440
Yeah, is that rocketeer?

4030
03:26:45,660 --> 03:26:46,560
Is it the drone or the rocketeer?

4031
03:26:46,640 --> 03:26:47,360
I can't tell.

4032
03:26:47,540 --> 03:26:48,500
I don't know where they is.

4033
03:26:48,740 --> 03:26:49,320
I can't see it.

4034
03:26:49,520 --> 03:26:49,940
Whatever that is.

4035
03:26:50,060 --> 03:26:51,040
Rocketeer, rocketeer, rocketeer.

4036
03:26:51,160 --> 03:26:51,860
Rocketeer, rocketeer.

4037
03:26:52,380 --> 03:26:56,620
What about that other person?

4038
03:26:57,040 --> 03:26:57,980
Did we kill that last guy?

4039
03:26:58,280 --> 03:26:58,660
No, he ran.

4040
03:26:58,940 --> 03:26:59,380
Yeah, he ran.

4041
03:27:01,320 --> 03:27:02,380
Did you guys loot them?

4042
03:27:02,880 --> 03:27:05,460
Yeah, I looted the one guy.

4043
03:27:05,840 --> 03:27:06,760
Is this the other guy we killed?

4044
03:27:06,820 --> 03:27:07,000
No.

4045
03:27:07,220 --> 03:27:07,600
There's two.

4046
03:27:07,660 --> 03:27:08,200
There's two down.

4047
03:27:10,320 --> 03:27:11,260
Is that the other guy?

4048
03:27:11,420 --> 03:27:13,380
Who wants to play this game a lot?

4049
03:27:14,100 --> 03:27:14,460
Why?

4050
03:27:15,060 --> 03:27:17,920
I just found a good blueprint that's like for the meta gun.

4051
03:27:18,300 --> 03:27:21,360
I think Altair will play more than me, right?

4052
03:27:21,880 --> 03:27:22,180
Are you sure?

4053
03:27:22,560 --> 03:27:23,300
You can have it.

4054
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:24,260
Okay.

4055
03:27:24,440 --> 03:27:25,880
I'm here for the psychological warfare.

4056
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:26,920
In that case, take this.

4057
03:27:27,340 --> 03:27:28,320
All right, Altair, take it.

4058
03:27:28,500 --> 03:27:29,000
Put it in your...

4059
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:30,120
Oh, we just have a safe pocket.

4060
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:31,400
Whoever has a safe pocket should have that.

4061
03:27:31,540 --> 03:27:32,920
I don't have a safe pocket.

4062
03:27:33,420 --> 03:27:34,800
I already use more in my safe pocket.

4063
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:36,420
My other item has more money.

4064
03:27:37,120 --> 03:27:37,840
Is there some things...

4065
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:39,900
I think you want that blueprint, but...

4066
03:27:39,900 --> 03:27:40,400
Where's the blueprint?

4067
03:27:41,440 --> 03:27:42,480
I put it on the ground.

4068
03:27:42,660 --> 03:27:43,280
I think Toki has it.

4069
03:27:43,900 --> 03:27:44,220
Oh, wait.

4070
03:27:44,360 --> 03:27:44,880
No, I don't.

4071
03:27:45,380 --> 03:27:45,960
It's on the ground.

4072
03:27:46,060 --> 03:27:46,400
Okay, here.

4073
03:27:46,540 --> 03:27:46,940
Thank you.

4074
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:48,260
What do you guys get?

4075
03:27:48,300 --> 03:27:49,700
shot at while we're doing this.

4076
03:27:49,880 --> 03:27:50,080
Ooh.

4077
03:27:52,500 --> 03:27:53,180
Thanks, dude.

4078
03:27:54,760 --> 03:27:55,620
That's a good gun.

4079
03:27:56,320 --> 03:27:58,100
So you guys only looted one of them?

4080
03:27:58,920 --> 03:28:00,260
I don't know where the other guy died.

4081
03:28:01,580 --> 03:28:02,400

4082
03:28:02,520 --> 03:28:04,260
Wait, wait, go straight to our north?

03:29:01,080 --> 03:29:02,780
I'd be surprised.

4098
03:29:05,020 --> 03:29:05,300

I guess we leave, right?

4102
03:29:12,260 --> 03:29:12,800

03:29:31,280 --> 03:29:32,080

next to us and rocketeers next to us wait I think we're safe

4123
03:29:53,700 --> 03:29:54,040
from it.

4124
03:29:57,340 --> 03:30:01,820
I would like to let Altair know that Doki did not fire a
single shot when him and Beto were fighting those two other

4125
03:30:01,820 --> 03:30:02,040
raiders.

4126
03:30:02,280 --> 03:30:03,340
I fired one shot.

4127
03:30:03,580 --> 03:30:05,360
No, I fired one shot.

4128
03:30:05,460 --> 03:30:06,220
One shot.

4129
03:30:06,400 --> 03:30:08,220
And then I said ping them, please.

4130
03:30:08,360 --> 03:30:08,860
And nobody here.

4131
03:30:09,320 --> 03:30:10,200
I split two bandages.

4132
03:30:10,620 --> 03:30:11,340
I was under a lot of pressure.

4133
03:30:11,460 --> 03:30:12,420
I couldn't ping right now.

4134
03:30:12,920 --> 03:30:13,980
I only saw one guy.

4135
03:30:14,060 --> 03:30:15,040
You guys are live.

4136
03:30:15,200 --> 03:30:18,380
I saw what I saw the one guy and I shot him and knocked him.

4137
03:30:18,840 --> 03:30:21,960
Also, Beto, there's another stack of bandages here.

4138
03:30:22,300 --> 03:30:22,700

03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:32,620
Yeah, you shot so many bullets.

4144
03:30:33,840 --> 03:30:35,120
It's dark in here.

4145
03:30:39,750 --> 03:30:40,150
What?

4146
03:30:40,590 --> 03:30:41,610
Does that sound above us?

4147
03:30:42,190 --> 03:30:43,550
It's just a snitch.

4148
03:30:46,230 --> 03:30:47,250
Not a great luck.

4149
03:30:47,790 --> 03:30:48,930
What was the guy that ratted?

4150
03:30:50,330 --> 03:30:51,250
He just ran off.

4151
03:30:51,390 --> 03:30:52,250
We never got sick again.

4152
03:30:52,370 --> 03:30:52,670

Maybe you should.

4169
03:32:26,620 --> 03:32:28,620
Well, we have nine minutes until this is done.

4170
03:32:29,140 --> 03:32:30,340

4171
03:32:31,520 --> 03:32:34,040

Oh, okay.

4173
03:32:35,300 --> 03:32:37,900
They close off at like different intervals.

4174
03:32:39,680 --> 03:32:43,000
You can try to see if anybody's climbing this tower and just
try to kill them when they come up.

4175
03:32:43,680 --> 03:32:44,480
Or do that.

4176
03:32:50,960 --> 03:32:51,340
Oof.

4177
03:32:52,840 --> 03:32:53,980
My, what a bad shot I am.

4178
03:32:54,320 --> 03:32:55,240
I hate these.

4179
03:32:57,240 --> 03:32:57,900
Snitches suck.

4180
03:32:58,340 --> 03:32:59,800

Wait, are these?

4185
03:33:05,540 --> 03:33:06,020

03:33:06,440 --> 03:33:07,040
Oh, hornet.

4187
03:33:07,840 --> 03:33:09,480
Wait, I gotta kill the surveyor, I think.

4188
03:33:13,320 --> 03:33:16,260
We might, like, lure people over with it.

4189
03:33:17,920 --> 03:33:19,300
I hear another gunshot.

4190
03:33:20,720 --> 03:33:21,160
Like...

4191
03:33:21,160 --> 03:33:22,020
Yeah, I see them.

4192
03:33:22,620 --> 03:33:23,120
Where are they?

4193
03:33:24,560 --> 03:33:25,760
I'm gonna talk about this rock.

4194
03:33:26,540 --> 03:33:26,680
Okay.

4195
03:33:28,420 --> 03:33:29,300

4196
03:33:29,300 --> 03:33:32,120

03:33:37,060 --> 03:33:37,920
He's dead.

4201
03:33:39,220 --> 03:33:39,560
Bro.

4202
03:33:40,280 --> 03:33:41,300
What's the sniper called?

4203
03:33:41,420 --> 03:33:42,040
Is it just sniper?

4204
03:33:42,420 --> 03:33:43,500
It's called an osprey.

4205
03:33:44,020 --> 03:33:44,600
Oh, I see.

4206
03:33:45,660 --> 03:33:46,880
Oh, I broke him.

4207
03:33:47,460 --> 03:33:49,900
You gotta snitch above you.

4208
03:33:52,480 --> 03:33:53,080
There.

4209
03:33:53,440 --> 03:33:54,220
Way to snitch.

4210
03:33:55,260 --> 03:33:57,120
Yeah, I snitch the snitch.

4211
03:33:59,800 --> 03:34:01,240
Another one?

4212
03:34:02,820 --> 03:34:05,560
Bro, are you serious?

4213
03:34:06,020 --> 03:34:06,660

Oh my god.

4215
03:34:08,800 --> 03:34:09,240
He never dies.

4216
03:34:11,360 --> 03:34:12,320
Yeah, that's annoying.

4217
03:34:13,260 --> 03:34:15,180
I didn't even realize he was on me.

4218
03:34:15,820 --> 03:34:17,000
I don't see anybody else.

4219
03:34:19,320 --> 03:34:19,820
I do.

4220
03:34:20,200 --> 03:34:20,740
Heads up.

4221
03:34:22,260 --> 03:34:23,280
And the guy died.

4222
03:34:27,040 --> 03:34:28,200

4228
03:35:26,090 --> 03:35:29,310
guys It's his birthday, so we're trying to get him an
extraction.

4229
03:35:31,090 --> 03:35:32,090
Well, we can do that.

4230
03:35:32,810 --> 03:35:35,590
There's only game that he's played with Stardew Valley, so
he's pretty new to this stuff.

4231
03:35:35,670 --> 03:35:36,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4232
03:35:36,050 --> 03:35:37,690
This is his first day playing.

4233
03:35:42,100 --> 03:35:45,280
What if we, like, shoot them when we're at the extraction?

4234
03:35:45,620 --> 03:35:47,840
That's even... You want to do the most fucked up thing
possible.

4235
03:35:48,560 --> 03:35:49,720
Yeah, of course I do.

4236
03:35:50,120 --> 03:35:51,700
That should be how we end it.

4237
03:35:52,640 --> 03:35:54,300
That actually should be how we end it.

4238
03:35:54,320 --> 03:35:55,400
I'm not participating in this.

4239
03:35:55,460 --> 03:35:56,100
I'm putting my foot down.

4240
03:35:56,140 --> 03:35:56,620
I can't do it.

4241
03:35:56,660 --> 03:35:57,080
I can't do it.

4242
03:35:58,060 --> 03:35:58,720
It's pointless.

4243
03:35:58,860 --> 03:35:59,280
It's pointless.

4244
03:35:59,820 --> 03:36:01,000
Let's go to the extraction.

4245
03:36:01,080 --> 03:36:01,780
Is that the extraction?

4246
03:36:02,440 --> 03:36:03,480
I think it is down here.

4247
03:36:05,140 --> 03:36:06,180
How do we get there?

4248
03:36:06,320 --> 03:36:06,900
Not quite.

4249
03:36:07,080 --> 03:36:07,320
Hold on.

4250
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:08,960
Uh-oh.

4251
03:36:09,320 --> 03:36:11,020
Wait, how do we set... Activate it?

4252
03:36:11,840 --> 03:36:12,320
There's a button.

4253
03:36:12,540 --> 03:36:13,940
I think it's being activated right now.

4254
03:36:14,060 --> 03:36:14,760
Oh, okay.

4255
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:15,680

Guys, I have three grenades.

4258
03:36:20,060 --> 03:36:22,300
They could all go down there and I could just throw a bunch
of grenades on there.

4259
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:23,500
I can't, dude.

4260

03:37:02,500 --> 03:37:02,660
They're good.

4291
03:37:02,900 --> 03:37:03,040
They're good.

4292
03:37:03,280 --> 03:37:03,300
They're fine.

4293
03:37:03,400 --> 03:37:05,940

theme it's good to have a plan yeah i don't know i feel like

4384

the improvisation worked out more better you know it did it
did it did so how bloodthirsty battle actually is yeah i

4385
03:42:38,400 --> 03:42:44,960
think my favorite my favorite was definitely the birthday
strat oh that one was my favorite i feel like we could pull

4386
03:42:44,960 --> 03:42:50,760
that off like several times before it like well we could be
the richest people in the wasteland if i just removed my

4387
03:42:50,760 --> 03:42:55,140
yeah if you just remove no you're just pretending to have
the worst place like you're pretending to have a conscious

4388
03:42:55,140 --> 03:43:02,160
because you still did it you still i have a conscious you
know what that's true yeah i realized like i didn't really

4389
03:43:02,160 --> 03:43:09,260
have a conscious it was just that they gave me stuff in the
end so then i was like i do like free things so um but like

4390
03:43:09,400 --> 03:43:12,560
But like, that was fun.

4391
03:43:12,760 --> 03:43:15,340
The birthday show was just one of my favorite strategies
that we did.

4428
03:45:23,020 --> 03:45:29,500

sponsor stream tomorrow um i think i'm trying to remember um

4429
03:45:29,500 --> 03:45:35,100
i think it was where it was for a gacha game i'm trying i
can't remember the title sorry my mind has been super

4430
03:45:35,100 --> 03:45:38,300
frazzled lately so um it's all over

4431
03:45:42,020 --> 03:45:44,460
So that's why I'm like, I don't remember.

4432
03:45:44,580 --> 03:45:46,240
I have to check my messages again.

4433
03:45:46,340 --> 03:45:50,480
Because the last couple of days, I've been like not really
up to date with my message.

4434
03:45:50,580 --> 03:45:51,700
I mean, like always.

4435
03:45:52,020 --> 03:45:55,940
But like, you know, the last few days I've even been up to
date with like exactly what I'm doing.

4436
03:45:56,120 --> 03:45:57,840
Like what my work stuff is lately.

4437
03:45:58,280 --> 03:46:00,480
Because I'm so tired.

4438
03:46:00,580 --> 03:46:03,880
I was actually so tired for this stream before this stream.

4439
03:46:04,840 --> 03:46:08,080
Because I had to do like this meeting where I had to look
over this project.

4440
03:46:08,280 --> 03:46:11,160
And the project leader was like showing me like progress and
stuff.

4441
03:46:11,340 --> 03:46:13,740
I didn't really want to talk, but I had to join the call.

4442
03:46:14,220 --> 03:46:17,120
So, like, me and my manager joined the call of this project.

4443
03:46:17,420 --> 03:46:20,680
The project is being worked on to, like, they're guiding us
through, like, the stuff.

4444
03:46:21,060 --> 03:46:26,800
And then I was just typing to my manager, and he just spoke
for me, because I didn't want to talk at all, because I

4445
03:46:26,800 --> 03:46:31,440
wanted to save my talking stuff for this collab.

4446
03:46:32,740 --> 03:46:39,400
Because I was just like, I need, I'm so socially, the thing
is, I was so socially drained, that I was just like, okay, I

4447
03:46:39,400 --> 03:46:40,740
gotta save all my energy for today.

4448
03:46:40,840 --> 03:46:46,500
I gotta save all my energy for this collab today because I'm
so tired from, because I'm an introvert.

4449
03:46:46,620 --> 03:46:48,380
Like, my social battery is literally at critical.

4450
03:46:48,740 --> 03:46:54,000
I've just been charging it at 10% every day and then
draining it every day.

4451
03:46:55,600 --> 03:47:04,120
So, so, so it was like, I'm not, I'm not like, okay at the
moment because I'm so socially tired because I've done so

4452
03:47:04,120 --> 03:47:06,080
many claps back to back to back.

4453
03:47:06,700 --> 03:47:17,180
But, oh yeah, um, Metal Gear Solid might be delayed because,
um, um, I have to talk to Min about it, um, because, like,

4454
03:47:17,180 --> 03:47:25,960
uh, uh, Nexi said that she would prefer if it was in the
first week of December because she is traveling right now.

4455
03:47:26,360 --> 03:47:29,780
So, you know, I want to make sure, you know, she won the,
she won the charity auction.

4456
03:47:29,900 --> 03:47:34,920
I want her to make sure that, you know, she'll be there to
actually watch the stream since she was the one that

4457
03:47:34,920 --> 03:47:36,600
requested the game.

4458
03:47:39,220 --> 03:47:43,480
So that's why I'm just going to be talking to men and seeing
what her schedule is like.

4459
03:47:43,700 --> 03:47:53,180
And if she is free for the stream on the first week of
December.

4460
03:47:53,480 --> 03:47:54,140
So we'll see about that.

4461
03:47:54,280 --> 03:47:56,700
Anyway, guys, I'm going to head off now.

4462
03:47:56,880 --> 03:47:57,600
As always, everybody.

4463
03:47:57,840 --> 03:47:58,460
Stay hydrated.

4464
03:47:58,660 --> 03:47:59,120
Posture check.

4465
03:47:59,220 --> 03:48:00,680
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

4466
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:03,780
If you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

4467
03:48:03,900 --> 03:48:04,940
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4468
03:48:05,180 --> 03:48:05,700
Bye, guys.

4469
03:48:07,060 --> 03:48:08,020
Guys, I'm not...

4470
03:48:08,040 --> 03:48:09,040
that evil.

4471
03:48:10,180 --> 03:48:12,340
I do it for content, guys.

4472
03:48:13,080 --> 03:48:15,720
And as long as I repent, it's fine.

4473
03:48:15,880 --> 03:48:16,860
All is forgiven.

4474
03:48:17,460 --> 03:48:23,620
As long as I repent at the end, before I die and be like,
I'm sorry.

4475
03:48:24,020 --> 03:48:25,320
All will be forgiven.

4476
03:48:26,100 --> 03:48:31,120
Like, I'm going to hell.

4477
03:48:34,440 --> 03:48:35,200
Yeah.

4478
03:48:35,680 --> 03:48:37,580
Anyway, anyway, I'll see.

4479
03:48:38,040 --> 03:48:41,260
Guys, it's boring when you play nice all the time.

4480
03:48:42,200 --> 03:48:43,220
Thank you, everyone.

4481
03:48:43,320 --> 03:48:44,160
Bye-bye, guys.

4482
03:48:44,640 --> 03:48:45,040
Bye.
