No, it's Pales by Pales.

5
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,940
It actually is actually an Italian brand.

6
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,480
That's right.

7
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,860
That's why you've never heard of it before.

8
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,880
It's from a very, very small village in Italy.

9
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,820
And it's all the rage in Europe right now.

10
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,240
I know.

11
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,780
You might have not heard of it because you're just not rich enough to realize how expensive this brand is.

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,760
I can't believe they're making me do

15
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,500
this case.

16
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,620

00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,380
Alright, let's go.

18
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,440
Initiation.

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,200

24
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,540
Alright, here we go, go.

26
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,740
Here we go.

27
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Oh shit!

28
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,800
I gotta listen to the HKPD radio station.

29
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,120
Oh.

30
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,360

31
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,420

Eliminate all the thugs in the hat.

35
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:39,940
Hangout?

36
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,060

Where's the thugs?

38
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,100
I have something more important, though.

39
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,620
Where's initiation?

40
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,280
Okay, someone else can handle that.

41
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm undercover.

42
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,940
I can't do this job.

43
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,260
I'm undercover right now.

44
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,740
Oh, I don't need to listen to the cop radio.

45
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,740
I gotta listen to my jam.

46
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,540
Okay, how do I...

47
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,480

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,400
Right here.

49
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,180
And then...

50
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,380
This is...

51
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,460
Okay, there we go.

There we go.

59
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,860
I can't believe all these cars driving on the wrong side of the road.

60
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,180

61
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:36,100

67
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,540
That's...

68
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,180
I like, what are you doing at a hospital?

69
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,240
Oh, it's because the guy, he's...

70
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,280
Oh, I forgot about him.

71
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,420
I forgot he's in the hospital.

72
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,380
A man who would continue...

73
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
I thought he got better.

74
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,440
If they were brazen enough to attack a wedding, we have to assume...

75
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:51,280
18k will be coming after us i know that you are right and i got better my boy uncle you're okay thanks to you sister jang told me about the troubles between you and big smile lee here you must stop this fight at once we must be united against our true enemies yes of course uncle don't worry uncle po as long as i get a promotion He's been a loyal foot soldier to the Sun Han yeah,

76
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,040
very loyal to make him a red pole Very very loyal.

77
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:06,760
It's like I've been here for like one month He has been selling to school girls and was ordered to stop He switched to the 18k instead make an example of it.

78
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,540
Thank you.

79
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:22,080
I will if any of your people have not been properly initiated bring them with you Uncle we still need to decide who will lead us Surely initiating someone that's been in the gang for one month is a good idea, right?

80
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,500
Oh, yes, he's a rat.

81
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,460
I can tell.

82
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,140
He's a fucking smell a rat.

83
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,680
Anytime you're like, you've been a loyal person for so long, that's a fucking rat right there.

84
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,140
He's a double agent.

85
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm calling it right now.

86
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,660
There's no way.

87
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,120
Why would he say that?

88
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,560
Why?

89
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,360
And keep the...

90
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,440
That's such a huge red flag.

91
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,100
Unlike me, I'm loyal.

92
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,060
I ain't no rat.

93
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,760
Temporary chairman.

94
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,620
Imagine naming your fucking nephew Tuchin.

95
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,180
Like, I'm pretty sure he did not pick that name.

96
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,860

100
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,940
Not only it gave me the chaos expected, but it was also a game I played.

It does.

104
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:58,120
One of the nicknames I gave, like, my family gave one of my cousins was literally Nyo-Nyo, which means, like, cow-cow.

105
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,680
Because he, when he was young, he loves to drink milk.

106
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,500
So all my Thai family would call him, like, Nyo-Nyo.

107
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
His name's literally, cow-cow.

108
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,740
Yeah.

109
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,440
I think, like, I hated my nickname.

Because I think someone's venting.

160
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,460
All right.

161
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,760
Now we just got the wall.

162
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,880
Ain't not as fun.

163
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,480
Not as fun, apparently, though.

164
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,480
Wait, can I do anything with a chair?

165
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,700
No, it's just the wall.

166
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,520
Whoa!

167
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,360
Hey!

168
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:55,860
No!

169
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,480
Bad!

170
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,780
Get out!

171
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,980
Okay, that's fine.

172
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,960
Don't let me grab you.

173
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,420
Then you get jumped.

174
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,160
Get out of here!

175
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,480
Get out of here!

176
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,800
He's holding me back!

177
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,300
Oh, shit.

178
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,340
So you won't get hurt.

179
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:47,540
that's right he's protecting him he's protecting you from me okay I pressed why oh fuck okay that's fine that's fine I spammed why I don't know why he still grabbed me though oh my god please please stop I'll let it I'll let Jackie handle this I'll just back I'll run I'll bravely run away.

180
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,320
Fight me back.

181
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,700
Don't worry.

182
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,860
Don't worry.

183
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,140
You'll be my...

184
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,840
Oh shit!

185
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,780
It's okay.

186
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,320
Things will be fine.

187
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,300
I just gotta regen.

188
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm regenning.

189
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,320
Don't worry, I'm just regenning.

190
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,840
No, no, I can regen my HP.

191
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,400
Don't worry.

192
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,040
My heart is beating really fast, but I'm fine.

193
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,700
I might be beating 90 hours per second.

194
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,000
beats per second, but that's okay.

195
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,640
Don't wait, Jack, I got you!

196
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,760
Nice.

197
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,880
We did it.

198
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
Guys, I don't think I'm regaining HP, guys.

199
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,020
This does not look like I'm getting my HP back.

200
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,300
This is the star.

201
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,420
Anubis, welcome to tomato farm.

202
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,360
Welcome, welcome.

203
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,900
Oh, shit!

204
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,560
Oh, fuck.

205
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,540
Okay, I got it.

206
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,100
That's right.

207
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,200
Get kicked.

208
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,780
Uncle Po sent us.

209
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,900
Who's young?

210
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,980
This guy?

211
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,340
Oh, it's him.

212
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,760
Alright, you got this, Jackie.

213
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,140
Just don't get hit.

214
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, that's right.

215
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,100
Okay, Jackie, look.

216
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,500
You can literally just jump-crap with him.

217
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,500
Look, he's not paying attention to me.

218
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,780
There we go.

219
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,740
Your turn.

220
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,460
Your turn.

221
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,260
Come on.

222
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,000
Come on.

223
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,020
You can do it.

224
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,860
Come on, Jack.

225
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,980
Just hit him once.

226
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,260
Look, hit him once.

227
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,760
That's fine.

228
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,740
He's like, he's like, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but yet he still hits me.

229
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm like, whoa, shit.

230
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,360
He's like, I will do it again.

231
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
He says that he keeps kicking me.

232
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,220
I like how he was like apologizing while he was still fighting me.

233
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,300
Oh, I was going to say, like, what?

234
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,900
Jack's like, I'm healthy.

235
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,780
Fuck, he kills, yo.

236
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,860
Let's go, come on.

237
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,660
Let's move.

238
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,800
I can't believe it.

239
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,480
He kills soul for me.

240
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,120
Shit, we have never done that before.

241
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,640
I know.

242
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,340
Oh, he's never killed?

243
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,400
I don't know.

244
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,260
My hands are shaking, man.

245
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,960
Bro, why are you in a game?

246
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,200
I'm sorry, I went on the left side.

247
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,740
I went on the left side.

248
00:21:15,980 --> 00:22:45,280

249
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,360
can for their children.

250
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,280
It protects your businesses and families.

251
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,000
Didn't the uncle almost die?

252
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,780
Enemies with pain, suffering, and death.

253
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,600
And none suffers more than a traitor.

254
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,780
Betray your brother.

255
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,620
You will die a thousand times over.

256
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,280
I will never betray us, brothers.

257
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,800
The sun on me and the gods themselves will burn your soul from your body, crushing ashes without

258
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,680
here.

259
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,680
With them, you become son-on-yee.

260
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Who would do it?

261
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,620
Yes, I am ready, brothers.

262
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,300
You're totally not a cop.

263
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,240
I'll never betray us, guys.

264
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,180
Oh, nice.

265
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,660
That's something for you.

266
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,560
Meet me in an hour.

267
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,180
No better way to show loyalty than by keeping the police jacket on.

268
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,020
Is it a slow day or something?

269
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,260
Pender is very impressed.

270
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,600
I'm not going to lie.

271
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm sort of impressed, too.

272
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,040
He wants you to dig around.

273
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,520
See what you can find on Sunny Woe.

274
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,500
Says it's a priority.

275
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,720
I read about it.

276
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,520
I mean, he reps entertainers, dabbles in porn with allegedly some human trafficking mixed in.

277
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,560
Why go after him?

278
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,340
He's not Sun on Yee.

279
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,440
To bring down the Sun on Yee, we have to take down the people who support them, cut off the revenue sources, dismantle the network.

280
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,040
This is how we hit them where it hurts.

281
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,880
Sunny's revenue stream is massive.

282
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,060
Trey, welcome to Tamir Farm.

283
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,840
Welcome, welcome.

284
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,600
I'll see what I can do, Raymond.

285
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,260
By the way, you hear anything about dog eyes?

286
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,700
He seems to have disappeared.

287
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,240
Haven't heard a thing.

288
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,060
Oh, before I forget, Jackie Ma, we're taking him in.

289
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,660
Jackie?

290
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,580
What I read in your reports?

291
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,160
Jackie?

292
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Bro, he's at the bottom tier.

293
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,320
That makes no sense.

294
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,640
Yeah, he's nobody.

295
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,680
He's a criminal way.

296
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,860
You're a cop.

297
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,880
I hate to be a broken record, but it sounds like you're getting attached.

298
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm not getting attached.

299
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,620
I'm just...

300
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
I'm not a fucking idiot.

301
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,200
Okay, that...

302
00:24:45,200 --> 00:25:10,980
he does nothing to be fair he's the one who vouchs for me and now you're so high up you don't need him he's outlived his usefulness so we're bringing him in i'm taking this up a pendulum this came from taking him in accomplishes nothing and it makes my job harder i'm not doing it you don't have a choice yeah but you're right jack jackie is is a little he has a little bit of a loud mouth directly up he's weak so he'll talk

Zero killer.

Okay, I gotta call Jackie.

319
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,160
We don't need to worry about the zero killer.

320
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,000
That's not as important.

321
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
Jackie, how's it going?

322
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,700

This could be big for us.

325

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,100

332
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,700

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,500
We need to get a car.

00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,200
Speaking of green taxis, they don't want to take me anywhere.

Alright, I guess I have to drive.

00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,380
I can't use it.

394
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,820
I just get a gun.

395
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,520
How do I get out of here?

396
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,220
Oh, that's it.

397
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,080
Nice.

00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,500

400
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,440
You want me to drop you off somewhere or you're just all right.

401
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:38,480
He's just with me now I got a little I got a little buddy or a buddy system

402
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm okay throughout this entire time.

403
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,860
I've been trying to remember my Chinese nickname.

404
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,620
I actually don't remember that's how much It's crazy.

405
00:35:51,800 --> 00:36:11,800
I remember the one that I hated I remember I remember the nickname that I fucking hated that was given to me by my cousins but I don't even remember the nickname that my grandparents and my relatives, my aunts and uncles gave me it was so irrelevant to me

406
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,430
I'm like, was it that one?

407
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,850
I'm like, no, that has to be someone else's nickname, right?

408
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,950
It was like I think it was like, it was...

409
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,410
Oh!

410
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,030
No, I had several.

411
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,030
It's because, like, okay, I remember now.

412
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:44,650
It's because, um, um, my relatives gave me, like, two different nicknames, so I could never remember it.

413
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,090
That's why I don't know.

414
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,130
I just, I always made fun of my cousin's nickname, though.

415
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,450
The one that's called Cow Cow, Nyo-Nyo.

416
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,610
Just because I thought it was so...

417
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,490
I just thought it was funny.

418
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,790
That's what I'm saying.

419
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,610
Sometimes, like, there's no way these people gave themselves that nickname.

420
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,330
It's always by a relative.

421
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,270
Just because he just loved milk.

422
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,830
He just really loved drinking milk.

423
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,020
Okay, make your way.

424
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,180

00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,040

426
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,160
Wait, I thought I was picking up Jackie.

427
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,900

430
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,400
He was like, I called shotgun.

431
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,740
You should take a few days off.

432
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,600
It don't look so good.

433
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,540
I haven't been sleeping too well.

434
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,760
It's because he shot again?

435
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,420
Every time I close my eyes, I see that guy.

436
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:21,940
First time?

437
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,520
I guess it's just...

438
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,380
Man, I don't know.

439
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,380
Sometimes I wake up and I have this bad feeling.

440
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
I've never had that before.

441
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,200
Well, you join a game.

442
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,580
Low key.

443
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,760
Good payday.

444
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,260
Low key.

445
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,520
This job is not low-key.

446
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,220
She's good.

447
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,020
She's good.

448
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,120
I haven't talked to her.

449
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,200
Come on, Jackie.

450
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,580
She was your dream girl.

451
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,580
Yeah, I know.

452
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,880
But maybe when we're done this job, I'll give her one of the pieces.

453
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,020
That's great, Jack.

454
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,140
You know, she'll love it.

455
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,380
It's so low-key, you know, shooting a guy.

456
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,440
The low is so low.

457
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,800
Carrying firearms in public?

458
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,300
Damn.

459
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,240
That's low-key.

460
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:17,840
bro oh wait there's a shrine all right we gotta grab that too i feel like i grabbed so many shrines but i have like zero upgrades yeah

461
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:40,960
he's talking to a man who breaks yeah exactly i'm like i mean jackie you've seen me shot so many people like at one point when i shot the 50th guy i think you're coping when you say that um they're all okay i follow jackie I think at that point, you might be repressing something.

462
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,560
Not all of them head to the hospital at that point.

463
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,980
You always have options, yeah.

464
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,780
You think so?

465
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,940
I don't know, way.

466
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,300
I don't know if that's true.

467
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,020
You're like, Joki, I don't think that 50th person went to the hospital.

468
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,060
No problem.

469
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,700
There are heavy duty tools in this shed just over there.

470
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,160
You get the tools.

471
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,440
I'll scout the containers.

472
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,780
Meet me there when you have someone to cut the lock.

473
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,720

521
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,960

00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,420
I crave, like, hot pot.

661
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,500
And, um...

662
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,160
I know there's places where you can have your own little hot pot.

663
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,420
Like, your own little mini pot.

664
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,820
Um, but, like...

665
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:03,000
I hate it when if you wanted to have like Korean barbecue or whatever or Yaki Miku You have to eat with somebody because like the portions are just way too much

666
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:20,600
That grinds my gears Because it's like you gotta have someone to eat this with or like it's just too much Same with like hot pot too

667
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:49,930
Because I remember when I went to like I told you guys the story i went to korean barbecue i was like do you guys have any combos for like one person and they're like no you got it it's we only have like two or more and i'm like okay i guess i'll guess i'll just order a two-person combo for myself not that's it's not that sad right

668
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,170
it's it's not that sad

669
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,270
Deeper too, I guess

670
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:38,970
It's like It's like trying to go to Haidilau by yourself We also don't know Haidilau Haidilau is like one of the best hot pop Like franchise hot pop Places in the world And it's so It's like what it's also very expensive It's very expensive but it's actually Like what the best hot pop place you can to because they treat you like they treat you so well i love hidey loud

671
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:57,840
it's so good but like it's so sad if you go there by yourself that's the it's just it's so you have to find people to go hidey loud with it's so sad

672
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:08,820

01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,940
He just needs, okay, we're leaving him.

819
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,980
So now that they're all out of the car, I can just, oh my God, don't leave Ricky.

820
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,040
Please, Ricky, get in here.

821
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,080
Get in here before.

822
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,700
Ricky, please, Ricky.

823
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:33,940
Where's Ricky?

824
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:35,860
Where is Ricky?

825
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,020
Get in the car.

826
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,860
Ricky, please get in the car.

827
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:45,500
Now that they're all out of the car, now that they're all out of the car, we did it.

828
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,880
It's just...

829
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,500
Okay, I got it.

830
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,380
Okay, we gotta make them stop in the car.

831
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,760
Make them get out of the car and we leave.

832
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,380
This plan.

833
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:06,840
It's brilliant.

834
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,120
Okay, I need them to get out of the car, though.

835
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,880
Come on, get out of the car.

836
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,540
Get out of the car and fight me.

837
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,680
I just need you to get out of the car.

838
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,500
Okay, that's fine.

839
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,180
We'll do a little ring around the rosy.

840
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,320
Both...

841
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,900
there we go there we go we're fine I just want if they all get out of the car

842
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:55,890
oh no we got we might have to swap cars it's just that easy oh my god how did they pop a tire no it's fine I can still run this.

843
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:59,830
There's no way they can do this turn.

844
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:01,530
This sick-ass turn.

845
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:03,330
Okay, maybe there is that way.

846
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,850
And then I'll do another turn.

847
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,150
They'll never expect it.

848
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,950
And then I'll turn like this.

849
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,630
Oh my god.

850
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,330
Okay, this is a little awkward.

851
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,010
Maybe he'll get out of the car.

852
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:19,790
Maybe they'll all get out of the car.

853
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:20,310
I don't know.

854
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:22,830
Okay.

855
01:14:25,150 --> 01:15:24,750
there we go it's just that easy look now we just have two cars okay now we have three cars but all I do I do a U-turn oh fuck okay I didn't expect a third car okay all I do is I do another U-turn and and then I do this they'll never expect it they'll never expect it and then after I U-turn here oh my god it's fine they're just helping me U-turn better after oh my god and then after that I U-turn here how is my car alive and then I U-turn here and they'll never expect it I think I might need a new car it's Okay,

856
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:35,150
and then after that, after that, I grab a new car right here.

857
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:40,510
And then, Ricky please get in here, Ricky please.

858
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:46,190
And then after that, because he got out of the car, I go this way.

859
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:52,830
Look, this is a 20 step plan.

860
01:15:52,830 --> 01:16:27,530
we're only at step two and now now that they're all out of the car because I got out of my car we should be safe what how did I die I don't understand we're still on step five I What happened to my 10-step program?

861
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:30,310
Part A!

862
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,150
That's fine.

863
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,770
I think I know what to do.

864
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:41,850
Part B, flat.

865
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:44,530
We gotta go to flat D, tilt E.

866
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:49,030
It's fine.

867
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,070
I just gotta drive somewhere.

868
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:53,930
I just got it.

869
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,410
Oh my god.

870
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,130
Now there's like 20 cops.

871
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:58,190
Where were they when we were in the hospital?

872
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,670
I have an idea.

873
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,670
I just keep driving.

874
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,650
Why didn't I think of this before?

875
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,310
I'm glad you showed up, right?

876
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:13,150
Why did I think of this before?

877
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:14,090
I just keep driving.

878
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,210
Cops might be watching the place.

879
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:16,750
Hey, Ricky.

880
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:17,930
Keep it tight.

881
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:20,430
They just got a new budget plan.

882
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:21,750
All right.

883
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:22,250
All right.

884
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,650

There's no risk involved.

889
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,120
I was okay with doing a security camera when the hospital's getting invaded just because of the thrill of the risk, you know?

890
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,720
The high pressure situation that I was in.

891
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,660
We made it more exciting.

892
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:24,180
Yeah, when I composed life was on the line, I felt that adrenaline rush.

893
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:25,660
Oh, there it is!

894
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,880

There it is.

897
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,620
There's the yellow taxis.

898
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,160
I didn't even realize we had blue taxis.

899
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,620
See, I wasn't making things up.

900
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,200
Alright, we gotta go home now.

901
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:45,980
Where's one?

902
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,220
Not home.

903
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:49,440
Oh, here.

904
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,860
Alright, we gotta go eating time.

905
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,980
We had a very long day.

906
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:02,760
What if it happened to my gun?

907
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,180
Can I get my gun back if I...

908
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,840
Do I get it back?

909
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,160
I just lose it forever?

910
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,120
What's the point?

911
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,420
Oh, wait, that's my bathroom.

912
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,400
Where's my bed?

913
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,080
Oh, there it is.

914
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,000
Keeping time.

915
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,280
A long day.

916
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,340
This is not my bedroom.

917
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,440
It's at school to bed.

918
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:30,660
Okay.

919
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,140
Oh, do I have to change?

920
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:37,380
Or do I have to change into my fucking sleepwear?

921
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,030
This is what...

922
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,190
This is the sleepwear.

923
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:47,810
This is my sleeping clothes.

924
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:51,730
Very comfy.

925
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,420
I thought I had to go to bed.

926
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,420
Yeah, see, I said go to bed.

927
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,300
I'm literally next to my bed.

928
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,600
Oh, there it is.

929
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:12,880

930
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,420
I had... This is my bed wear.

931
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,500
It makes me feel extra safe.

932
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,760
There we go.

933
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,560

Can't believe it.

956
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,460

01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:23,760

01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,700
Yeah, I mean, actually, that sounds all right.

987
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,220
If you don't mind showing me around.

988
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:17,840
Yeah, sure.

989
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,720
I wish I could go with you, players.

990
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,380
Don't worry, kid.

991
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,120
I know the best massage part is.

992
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,080
Yo, it was real nice to meet you, Sonny.

993
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,620
Let's do it.

994
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,180
Yeah, let's go do the legal stuff.

995
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,100
I've been thinking.

996
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,040
We need to get her a movie roll of some sort.

997
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,140
Hey, I think we'll start at the K bar.

998
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,020
The VIP room should give us what we need.

999
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,420
Hey, it's your town, man.

1000
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:41,980
Don't worry, King.

1001
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:42,360
Whoops.

1002
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:43,460
Don't worry.

1003
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,380
I'll show you the real Hong Kong.

1004
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:46,920
Just this one time.

1005
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,820
Man, that guy's a piece of work.

1006
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,240
Man, he's a fucking clown.

1007
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:50,960
You asked me.

1008
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,740
But he literally was like, don't worry.

1009
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:54,760
Don't worry.

1010
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:56,200
I'll...

1011
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,720
I'll help you cheat on your wife.

1012
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,640
And he's like, what?

1013
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:02,920
She's right here.

1014
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,440
I got some other business to discover.

1015
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,400
Huh?

1016
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,340
But I don't think my partner's back in the stay through want to be in bed with that guy.

1017
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,280
What kind of business?

1018
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,320
I got friends.

1019
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,100
The guys I grew up with.

1020
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:16,140
They got a real good import and retail thing going.

1021
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,560
But they could use a good Hong Kong.

1022
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:21,740
Access to that good Asian product.

1023
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:27,920
Wait, drugs?

1024
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:33,260

Oh, wait, no, that's someone else.

1037
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:54,800
Sorry, she was blonde.

1038
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,920
I confused her because she was blonde.

1039
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:03,500
But listen, I saw you looking at my friend and I figured you realized he's a famous American celebrity.

1040
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:06,800
And I just wanted to ask if you mind keeping it a secret.

1041
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:08,200
I thought it was Emma.

1042
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,740
How can I say no?

1043
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:13,220
If you're not doing anything, maybe I can buy you silence with a drink.

1044
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,040
Wanna join us?

1045
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,300
That's very nice.

1046
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:17,420
I thought it was Emma Stone.

1047
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:18,320
So you're from Russia?

1048
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:18,980
Yes.

1049
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,520
How'd you guess?

1050
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,100
I'll call it a hunch.

1051
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:22,960
Oh, you.

1052
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:25,380

1053
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,580

1066
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,420

I'll be right back.

1068
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:52,780
I'm so stressed out.

1069
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,480
I'm so stressed.

1070
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,280

Wait, how do I access it?

1074
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,720
The chat just gave me hands.

1075
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,720
And like, they can't bait me like this.

1076

Oh!

1325
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,120
I keep forgetting there's a police station next to me.

1326
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,940
I just bumped into him.

1327
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,480
It's not like he's dead or...

1328
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:22,260
Okay, wait, I got an idea.

1329
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,240
Watch this.

1330
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,360
And

1331
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,360
then...

1332
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,460
It just works.

1333
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,120
It just...

1334
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,440
Just get out of the car.

1335
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,300
And then drive away.

1336
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,100
Watch this.

1337
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:46,440
Okay, sir.

1338
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,360
Don't work, sir.

1339
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,680
I'll surrender myself.

1340
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:51,820
I'll...

1341
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,500
Oh, shit.

1342
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:55,860
Oh, shit.

1343
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,800
Why are there so many cars?

1344
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,320
I just bumped a man.

1345
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,500
Okay.

1346
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:02,980
And then I just do this.

1347
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:06,160
Oh, my God.

1348
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,080
There's so many people actually chasing me now.

1349
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:09,060
Wait, wait a minute.

1350
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:09,900
This is a little bad.

1351
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:10,780
Wait, that car?

1352
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,560
And then all I do?

1353
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:14,640
Noink.

1354
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:15,780
My car now.

1355
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,580
It's just that easy.

1356
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,800
And then, yeah, there's another cop car here.

1357
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:26,600
Watch this.

1358
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,460
Oh, my God.

1359
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:34,400
He got out.

1360
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:34,980
Never mind.

1361
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:35,420
Never mind.

1362
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:36,180
Don't watch this.

1363
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,300
Don't watch this.

1364
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,480
Don't watch this.

1365
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,000
I'm okay.

1366
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:41,540
I'm okay.

1367
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,820
Did I get caught?

1368
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:47,540
No!

1369
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:48,460
It's $1,000.

1370
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:49,420
Oh, that's fine.

1371
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:50,440
That's fine.

1372
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:52,180
That's $1,000 Hong Kong dollars.

1373
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:53,820
500 US.

1374
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:54,740
That's okay.

1375
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:55,700
For like murder?

1376
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,260
I'm fine with that.

1377
01:48:57,460 --> 01:49:06,780
I think it like brought me, I mean for like murder, that's fine.

1378
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,520
That's pretty cheap.

1379
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,000
That's fine.

1380
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:14,960
You know?

1381
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:21,860
That's such a s- yeah, that's such a slap on the wrist.

1382
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,380
You know what?

1383
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:26,160
I don't mind losing another thousand.

1384
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,880
Hey, now that I know it's just a thousand dollars.

1385
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:43,780
There we go.

1386
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:46,900
All I'm saying is that the cop...

1387
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:47,800
We gotta...

1388
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:53,480
We gotta budget cut the cops.

1389
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,640
That's all I'm saying.

1390
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:01,260
Look, I did that in front of the police station.

1391
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,640
I'm just sending a message.

1392
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,020
And now that I know, it's just $1,000.

1393
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:17,290
No consequences.

1394
01:50:20,670 --> 01:50:20,950
Alright.

1395
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:26,320
Nice.

1396
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,280
We made it.

1397
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,880
I don't mind you fucking her.

1398
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:31,240
It's one of the perks.

1399
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,840
But she has to understand the consequences if she disappoints me.

1400
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,020
Are we clear?

1401
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:36,500
Of course.

1402
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:36,740

1415
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,140

1416
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,120

Poor Ricky.

01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,560

01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:50,040

1425
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,100
But then put your face on it and felt so real while I woke up.

1426
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,300

No, Vivi.

1434
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:51,250
It's not wrong.

1435
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:53,510

01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:09,390
It's Wei.

1443
01:53:10,170 --> 01:53:11,570
Ricky talks about him a lot.

1444
01:53:11,770 --> 01:53:13,350
Oh, all nice things I'm sure.

1445
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:18,650
And you're here to basically do whatever We want something like that.

1446
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:19,690
What do you have in mind?

1447
01:53:19,890 --> 01:53:19,990
Hmm.

1448
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:24,250
Do you have Steady hands at high speeds?

1449
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:25,410
Yeah, absolutely.

1450
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:27,970
I mean, I can provide references if you like.

1451
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:29,170
I'll have to wear gloves, though.

1452
01:53:29,550 --> 01:53:31,290
If we're talking about holding hands.

1453
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:36,170
If we're gonna be holding hands, I have to wear gloves.

1454
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:36,790
I'm sorry.

1455
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:38,350
I'm sorry, I'm mad.

1456
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:39,570
So what's the deal, Wei?

1457
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:41,110
You a gangster like Ricky?

1458
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:42,350
He's not a gangster.

1459
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:43,190
Don't say that.

1460
01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:45,590
Let's say I'm as much of a gangster as Ricky.

1461
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:48,350
That's too bad recently.

1462
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:49,770
I've wanted to date a gangster.

1463
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:53,650
Well, maybe I'll see if I can find one for you That would be nice.

1464
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:55,310

01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:04,400
I should be racing with my police car.

1498
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,480
It's okay, I still have two more stars.

1499
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,600
I still have two more stars.

1500
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:20,850
Oh my god, the police might actually win the race.

1501
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:24,570
I didn't wonder if they were the ones that claimed the prize.

1502
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:28,670
Oh wait, he's gone.

1503
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,090
He just disappeared.

1504
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:34,290
I think it's because the game didn't want the police.

1505
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:35,210
this car to win.

1506
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:37,890
He actually despawned him.

1507
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:39,490
Oh my god, my heart is beating so fast.

1508
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:41,430
Steady hands.

1509
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:42,530

I may have not picked the worst road to do this on.

1668
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:04,970
Now let's go faster.

1669
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:07,870
Thank God there's no cars here.

1670
02:10:08,770 --> 02:10:09,610
Okay, now there you go.

1671
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:10,530
It's a straight ride.

1672
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:11,550
It's faster than this, right?

1673
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:14,190
Oh my god.

1674
02:10:14,210 --> 02:10:15,970
Oh my god, she's an adrenaline junkie.

1675
02:10:16,190 --> 02:10:18,210
Now we're going somewhere!

1676
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:21,510
Hang on, I gotta check this.

1677
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:22,750
I just gotta text with my dad.

1678
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:23,790
I have to go meet him.

1679
02:10:23,990 --> 02:10:24,730
Can you drive me home?

1680
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:25,910
Yeah, no problem girl.

1681
02:10:26,310 --> 02:10:27,690
Drop Sandra off her apartment.

1682
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:31,130
Whoa!

1683
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:35,350
Now things are getting spicy.

1684
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:41,010
That drive like super far away from the apartment.

1685
02:10:42,010 --> 02:10:43,430
Where is her apartment anyway?

1686
02:10:44,210 --> 02:10:45,070
God, it's so far.

1687
02:10:45,210 --> 02:10:45,210
Okay.

1688
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:46,250
It's so far.

1689
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:49,690
All right, it's this way.

1690
02:10:51,330 --> 02:10:51,970
I know, right?

1691
02:10:52,090 --> 02:10:53,770
Bro, this was a 60-second date.

1692
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:00,920
Oh my god.

1693
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:02,180
Guys, we're moving so fast.

1694
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:03,400
We're already meeting the dad.

1695
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:06,000
You think he'll like me?

1696
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:07,680
With what I'm wearing?

1697
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:11,440
Whoops.

1698
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:12,320
It's fine.

1699
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:13,040
It's okay.

1700
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:13,940
She likes that.

1701
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,120
She's an adrenaline junkie, remember?

1702
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:23,340
They call them 60 second way.

1703
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:31,720
All right, we're almost home.

1704
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:33,740
Don't worry, Sandra.

1705
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:36,520
Don't worry.

1706
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:38,420
We're almost there.

1707
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,340
Jesus Christ, you live like in the middle of nowhere.

1708
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:50,580
Oh yeah, no, I definitely chose the wrong road for this.

1709
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:55,020
I chose so far away.

1710
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,220
I'm almost there.

1711
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:11,700
Oh,

1712
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:16,760
wait, that's your house again.

1713
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:17,880
I forgot her place.

1714
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,520
I still need to get that shrine.

1715
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:23,760
Oh.

1716
02:12:26,140 --> 02:12:27,060

Come over here.

Okay.

1730
02:13:38,190 --> 02:13:40,570
There's one thing I know for sure.

1731
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:43,250
And that way is...

1732
02:13:43,250 --> 02:13:44,850
I think, guys...

1733
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:46,350
I don't know, but I have a feeling.

1734
02:13:46,370 --> 02:13:58,770
feeling that way may or may not might not be actually no that way might not be a version I'm not totally sure yet but I have a feeling

1735
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:09,130

1736
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:16,390

1737
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:17,930

Alright, let's see.

1739
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:23,900
What's our next one?

1740
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:26,120
Bad luck.

1741
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:30,160
I'm not too sure yet.

1742
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:36,240

1743
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:36,880
Oh, wait, nice.

Can I go the wrong way?

1759
02:15:53,650 --> 02:15:54,470
Where is it?

1760
02:15:58,620 --> 02:15:59,120
Is it here?

1761
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:02,900
Where the fuck is it?

1762
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:04,340
Why the fuck is...

1763
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,040
Okay, this road is so confusing.

1764
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:10,580
Okay, I have to go this way.

1765
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:16,320
There's so many highways.

1766
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:17,940
Exits and entrances.

1767
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:20,360
I'm not going the right way.

1768
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:20,820
Yeah, I am.

1769
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:24,020
No way out.

1770
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:29,790
Okay.

1771
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:33,890
And then we turn this way.

1772
02:16:34,790 --> 02:16:36,470
With my PNG chickens.

1773
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:41,910
Finally.

1774
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:44,530
I fixed my credit score.

1775
02:16:47,570 --> 02:16:48,130
Finally.

1776
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:51,890

1777
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:56,800
Alright.

1778
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:57,680

Let's go, Sun Tse!

1784
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:37,560
You wrote the art of war!

1785
02:17:39,380 --> 02:17:41,520

And we're gonna turn him into a PNG chicken now.

1792
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:05,160
I have a hundred percent win-ray on cockfighting.

1793
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:11,620
Oh wait, are they doing Tai Chi?

1794
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:14,120
Oh shit, the old people are doing Tai Chi.

1795
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:14,780
Let's go.

1796
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:17,960
Can I join in?

1797
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:21,700
Wait, where's my gun?

1798
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:21,960

All right, let's go.

1802
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:42,600
Let's go do that mission.

1803
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:44,120
What was it?

1804
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,700
Bad luck.

1805
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:51,500
How could I have bad luck?

1806
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:53,220
I feel like I'm winning right now.

1807
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:54,640
I just came back.

1808
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:57,380
I came back from my date with Sandra.

1809
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:00,880
And then my after party was the cockfight.

1810
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:03,720
That's a good day for me.

1811
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:04,500
Not gonna lie.

1812
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:16,800
Relax in the car with Sandra And won a cockfighting match I'm winning in life

1813
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:46,430
Alright I gotta go Talk to whoever's over there But I can rest someone You janitor Janitor get over here You're under arrest!

1815
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:51,370
Now off I go.

1816
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:53,710
That's right.

1817
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:56,070
So clean belly.

1818
02:19:59,710 --> 02:20:00,190
Alright, nice.

1819
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:06,910
Oh, you may join me.

1820
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:08,230
Careful some tea.

1821
02:20:08,890 --> 02:20:10,090
He's doing it.

1822
02:20:10,890 --> 02:20:12,150
Just thought about it.

1823
02:20:12,390 --> 02:20:14,930
He should have taught longer before.

1824
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:19,510
Oh, he starts cleaning the street at night Too comfortable.

1825
02:20:23,230 --> 02:20:31,150
I hear that he is already planning to make it permanent should uncle Po not recover Big smiley will kill him before he'll let that happen.

1826
02:20:31,510 --> 02:20:37,230
Indeed so many backstabbing that would allow Lee to take over the Sun on ye himself That can't happen.

1827
02:20:37,470 --> 02:20:45,210
No, it cannot Tuchin must go Oh, she's two-faced as hell.

1828
02:20:45,430 --> 02:20:47,250
There's no way Tuchin looks so friendly.

1829
02:20:47,370 --> 02:21:18,750
He looks so jolly why would he step down to chin like the heroine so far he has managed to control his habit i don't think you can control heron heroin on the brink of an abyss there's no controlling that of his supply to improve and now you will give him a nudge damn wait i'm gonna force him to overdose how maybe that's why he's so jolly Yeah,

1830
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:20,010
obsessed with feng shui.

1831
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:25,730
Yeah, he cannot bear to have the slightest thing out of place for fear of the misfortune it will bring.

1832
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:28,950
He's just micro-chosing, dokey.

1833
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:33,470
Oh, I'm going to make him paranoid.

1834
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:35,990
Oh, my, that's not good for heroin addicts, though.

1835
02:21:36,350 --> 02:21:38,510
Paranoia is a big no-no for them.

1836
02:21:44,620 --> 02:21:46,300
I just got to slip in more heroin.

1837
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:48,700

1881
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:45,920

1882
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:47,380
Whoa!

1883
02:23:47,380 --> 02:23:50,840
A real one.

1884
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:55,420
All massages are real.

1885
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:57,440
How dare you insult the ladies?

1886
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:00,660
They're as real as any other massage therapist.

1887
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:02,960
What?

1888
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:05,880
How dare he?

1889
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:07,780
They're real to me.

1890
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:13,690
How's business?

1891
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:15,490
To be honest, Tunga?

1892
02:24:16,150 --> 02:24:17,210
It ain't damn shitty.

1893
02:24:17,410 --> 02:24:17,710
Really?

1894
02:24:18,370 --> 02:24:19,270
Yeah, what happened?

1895
02:24:19,430 --> 02:24:21,490
They're gonna break from their morning squad game.

1896
02:24:21,690 --> 02:24:22,110
How come?

1897
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:23,750
Yeah, something went wrong.

1898
02:24:23,930 --> 02:24:25,370
I don't really want to talk about it.

1899
02:24:25,470 --> 02:24:25,910
All right.

1900
02:24:26,230 --> 02:24:26,890
Suit yourself.

1901
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:32,010
Bro, he just said that my massage, my massage therapist weren't real.

1902
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:33,850
How dare he?

1903
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:37,730
Can I just walk in?

1904
02:24:40,070 --> 02:24:42,250
No, I can't parkour in high enough.

1905
02:24:45,930 --> 02:24:47,250
How dare, they're real than me.

1906
02:24:47,570 --> 02:24:48,710
They work very hard.

1907
02:24:49,970 --> 02:24:51,110
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1908
02:24:52,730 --> 02:24:53,090
What?

1909
02:24:53,370 --> 02:24:54,810
The boss's dog got out.

1910
02:24:55,050 --> 02:24:56,530
We don't find it before he comes back.

1911
02:24:56,770 --> 02:24:57,110
Yeah.

1912
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:57,610
We'll roll.

1913
02:24:57,790 --> 02:24:58,330
Oh, shit.

1914
02:24:58,410 --> 02:24:59,870
I haven't seen it.

1915
02:25:01,130 --> 02:25:03,190
Yeah, we're just here to find his dog.

1916
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:06,130
He might be... Wait, where do I go?

1917
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:07,310
Let me in here?

1918
02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:08,630
Oh, he's...

1919
02:25:08,630 --> 02:25:09,650
Okay, I just gotta follow him.

1920
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:10,850
I gotta follow Three-chin.

1921
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:14,930
Or Four-chin.

1922
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:19,220
Wait here.

1923
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:20,540
I'll open the gate from the inside.

1924
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:22,180
From the inside?

1925
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:25,100
Why is this over here, right?

1926
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:26,160
It has to be.

1927
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:26,960
There's a cop there.

1928
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:27,400
Yeah.

1929
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:29,740
He's guarding that very suspicious ledge.

1930
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:43,940

1932
02:26:02,590 --> 02:26:03,150

1933
02:26:06,690 --> 02:26:09,150
I did it.

1934
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:10,750
I opened it.

1935
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:15,350
I don't think I needed to kick it, but okay.

1936
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,020
Why can't I kick this door?

1937
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:27,160
I think it's fine.

1938
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:30,500
No one will know.

1939
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:39,220
Man, if I were him, I spent my money There's no statue.

1940
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:43,920
How do I do this?

1941
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:46,260
Let me just move the stuff to make it seem like this ghost that don't like you.

1942
02:26:46,380 --> 02:26:47,240
What about those faces?

1943
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:48,280
Good idea.

1944
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:51,420
Maybe not just me.

1945
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:52,300
How do I do this?

1946
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,300
Oh, say.

1947
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:57,400
Yeah, say.

1948
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:57,940
Let me just let me try something else.

1949
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:00,540
We're some pretty unoriginal ghosts.

1950
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:02,360
Please!

1951
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:03,880
Let me in!

1952
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:05,960
You'll get there.

1953
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:07,720
Why don't I just move the stuff?

1954
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:09,840
Like, ever so slightly...

1955
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:13,800
Okay, if I do one mess with the feng shui, that should, like, move the things.

1956
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,980
Feng shui's all about placement.

1957
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:21,280
I didn't even...

1958
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:21,640
Okay.

1959
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,440
I didn't even... I just walked over it.

1960
02:27:25,740 --> 02:27:28,000
These are some fucking weak-ass...

1961
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Some weak-ass fucking bases.

1962
02:27:31,940 --> 02:27:33,820
Oh, it doesn't count!

1963
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:35,240
Wait!

1964
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:36,820
It doesn't count by me!

1965
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:40,440
Oh my god, if I push them over, it doesn't count.

1966
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:41,200
That's crazy.

1967
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:44,220
I think I smashed more than four.

1968
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:50,820
There we go.

1969
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,220
Now we just have one.

1970
02:27:59,060 --> 02:28:00,480
There it is.

1971
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:02,660
He really buys into this hocus pocus shit.

1972
02:28:02,940 --> 02:28:04,800
You can't blame the guy.

1973
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:07,480
To a chance, got more money than the priest.

1974
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:13,120
Oh my god, it's like 20.

1975
02:28:13,140 --> 02:28:13,880
numbers.

1976
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:14,720
There you go.

1977
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:15,580
Oh, it's at 13.

1978
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:16,200
It's 13.

1979
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,020
Wait, what?

1980
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:24,580
Excuse me.

1981
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:26,120
Why didn't you insta-doc?

1982
02:28:31,370 --> 02:28:32,310
Oh, there we go.

1983
02:28:32,390 --> 02:28:33,150
That's so weird.

1984
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,970
Oh, that was at 6.

1985
02:28:36,190 --> 02:28:37,110
Oh, my God.

1986
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:39,810
Oh, my God.

1987
02:28:39,890 --> 02:28:40,570
Keep accidentally.

1988
02:28:40,750 --> 02:28:42,070
I keep turning it too fast.

1989
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:44,730
There you go.

1990
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:48,790
We're not tied

1991
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:57,310

1994
02:29:20,830 --> 02:29:23,770
What does your crush have to do with moving a piano?

1995
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:27,410
That's your back, not your fucking dick.

1996
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:36,100
All right, nice.

1997
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:38,680
Yeah.

1998
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:48,140
It's everything, Doki.

1999
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:50,160
Mr. Chow, is that you?

2000
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:54,740
There's some rats.

02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:56,080
What do we do?

2002
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:56,940
Just hide.

2003
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:57,840
Stay calm.

2004
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:03,920
Am I taking cover?

2005
02:30:04,580 --> 02:30:06,220

They don't know.

2008
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:16,520
I took cover on the wrong side.

2009
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:17,740
Thank God I didn't get caught.

2010
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:20,000

What if I just peek out right now?

2012
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:39,200
They leave the gated community.

02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:45,900
Oh, we gotta hack it.

Hello, Dr. Tang.

2085
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:39,780

Yay, free van!

2091
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:50,980
I should really repaint this van.

2092
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:53,880
Conflicted loyalties.

2093
02:37:58,060 --> 02:37:59,620
All right, we'll go this way.

2094
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:04,860
Yay, free white band.

2095
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:07,320
What I've always wanted.

2096
02:38:10,620 --> 02:38:12,160
How far is this?

2097
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:15,160
It's pretty far.

2098
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:16,180
Let's grab a cab.

2099
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:25,280

02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:27,100

2101
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:29,460
We might not be there to find a cab.

2102
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:40,840
Yeah, they're spinning some bars right now.

2103
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:41,760
Oh, my God.

2104
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:42,380
Next week?

2105
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:44,820
Apparently, the Daffbug concert is next week on Fortnite.

2106
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,640
So you know what we're doing on the 27th.

2107
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:52,000
Fuck it up, Chinese boy.

2108
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:53,600
Oh, he female.

2109
02:39:53,660 --> 02:39:55,160
You mean the movie star?

2110
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:56,200
Oh, he female?

2111
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,520
What's she doing these days?

2112
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,700
She's doing another movie in the stripper assassin franchise.

2113
02:40:01,100 --> 02:40:03,200
A stripper assassin franchise.

2114
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:05,740
That would be huge for Vivian.

2115
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:37,080
yeah would help her profile yeah and the stripper assassin we're releasing the track that king produced tonight you have time you and the hottest star in hong kong go have fun i'd watch that the biggest franchise good we've got a joint venture making produced by steven chow i bring the production and distribution that's good money i bet yeah if vivian pisses me off that's where to end up But if there's more money,

2116
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:41,300
if I keep her a star, I just have to make sure she doesn't flake out on me.

2117
02:40:42,100 --> 02:40:44,900
Um, the strippers, I can't, I got it.

2118
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:49,500
Yeah, they have a, they have several spinoffs in the stripper assassin universe.

2119
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:53,760
There's the, the stripper, um, the stripper zombies are.

2120
02:40:54,540 --> 02:41:02,600
There's a one where, um, it sets 50 years before the stripper assassin organization was built.

2121
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:09,490
Okay, well, let's just...

2122
02:41:09,590 --> 02:41:11,010
Let's just grab the red car.

2123
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:13,770
I don't feel comfortable driving that white van anymore.

2124
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:15,030
Oh, yeah, don't forget the one.

2125
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:15,530
Oh, my God.

2126
02:41:15,690 --> 02:41:15,990
You're right.

2127
02:41:16,050 --> 02:41:19,630
The one set in the year 3000.

2128
02:41:20,430 --> 02:41:21,890
We're stripping assassins.

2129
02:41:22,130 --> 02:41:22,850
We're outlawed.

2130
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:28,610
And the descendant of the OG stripper assassin wants to bring it back.

2131
02:41:29,790 --> 02:41:31,110
Oh, the tournament arc was really good.

2132
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:31,630
I agree.

2133
02:41:32,330 --> 02:41:32,930
I agree.

2134
02:41:33,430 --> 02:41:38,790
Where every country nominates their own stripper assassin to represent them.

2135
02:41:39,590 --> 02:41:41,570
of who is the best stripper assassin.

2136
02:41:43,650 --> 02:41:45,970
What a masterpiece that one was.

2137
02:41:49,210 --> 02:41:51,570
I heard it out-earned the James Bond franchise.

2138
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:57,440
I was not happy.

2139
02:41:57,500 --> 02:42:00,620
Oh yeah, I did not like the 2018 remake either.

2140
02:42:01,280 --> 02:42:04,220
I didn't like all the- I heard that they were stuck in production hell.

2141
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:07,220
And there was like 10 rewrites of that script.

2142
02:42:07,960 --> 02:42:42,640
I think the craziest part is that I can't believe they casted Chris Pratt as uh as the stripper assassin like i get it they wanted to like subvert the tropes but like it just doesn't hit the thing you know like i didn't yeah when they like replaced it all with dudes i was like i didn't come here to watch to watch chris pratt be a stripper assassin i feel like they should i feel like they could show cast in chad and tatum exactly he he already got the stripping part down?

2143
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:47,740
He's just needed, and like technically 21 Jump Street was sort of like an assassin movie.

2144
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:49,840
He would have been perfect for the role.

2145
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:53,080
A second thought gave the bitch the full treatment.

2146
02:42:53,420 --> 02:42:56,540
Hacker computer bugged the place and planned the cameras.

2147
02:42:56,740 --> 02:42:58,260
All right, Sonny, I'll go do that.

2148
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:02,100
Excuse me, sir.

2149
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:03,860
I don't think I've seen you before.

2150
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:05,160
I'm a location scout.

2151
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:06,960
Could you let me have a look around?

2152
02:43:07,320 --> 02:43:09,500
Only residents and their guests are allowed, sir.

2153
02:43:09,720 --> 02:43:10,340
I'll be quick.

2154
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:20,260
I'll make it I'm the stripper assassin that they hide that they hide oh no I have to find another entrance

2155
02:43:25,370 --> 02:43:35,110
all right yeah when Netflix bought the adaptation rights it just wasn't the same that they had to go back to their roots you know

2156
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:49,940
and then like the fact that they started using CGI more when they started stripping I was like made her watch the practical effects, you know?

2157
02:43:50,540 --> 02:43:52,380
You can tell that that pole was CGI.

2158
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:53,980
It just didn't feel right.

2159
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:02,480
Yeah, I know.

2160
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:03,480
Like, what the hell?

2161
02:44:05,420 --> 02:44:07,680
Like, her leg face through the pole.

2162
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:09,900
Like, you think I didn't notice?

2163
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:36,360
CGI ruined the the stripping industry I get out of here he was just taking a smoking break and I just I'm like this random thug that beat him up I gotta get up there

2164
02:44:44,780 --> 02:45:02,440
okay all right this way enter the apartment oh wait we gotta do this first last time I listen to you on speakers.

2165
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:05,960
My brother just walked in and asked, what the fuck?

2166
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:11,900
How could, how does your brother not know about the stripper assassin lore?

2167
02:45:12,220 --> 02:45:13,840
The stripper assassin franchise.

2168
02:45:14,380 --> 02:45:21,420
It got nominated for an Emmy for a best screenplay.

2169
02:45:22,660 --> 02:45:24,900
God, your brother has no taste.

2170
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:28,180
Where do I get in?

2171
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:29,580
Oh, here, there's a door.

2172
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:30,860
I was going to break the window.

2173
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:35,080
Oh, shit, and that is my nail.

2174
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:36,640
I should really hand in these statues.

2175
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:40,760
Hey, your brother missed out.

2176
02:45:50,250 --> 02:45:50,770
Alright.

2177
02:45:51,310 --> 02:45:52,290
One is correct.

2178
02:45:53,490 --> 02:45:55,710
Four, five, six.

2179
02:45:57,210 --> 02:45:57,470
Oh.

2180
02:45:59,210 --> 02:45:59,810
Six.

2181
02:46:01,910 --> 02:46:02,370
Five.

2182
02:46:03,090 --> 02:46:04,830
Okay, we gotta figure out this then.

2183
02:46:05,370 --> 02:46:05,930
Seven.

2184
02:46:06,230 --> 02:46:07,770
Alright, seven, one, six, five.

I was gonna say, she's like right below me.

2200
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:34,820
Oh, but she's in the shower.

2201
02:48:37,820 --> 02:48:39,240
Don't get spotted.

2202
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:41,340
Runs.

2203
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:48,780
Oh, get to the balcony.

2204
02:48:49,360 --> 02:48:49,360
Easy.

2205
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:53,000
See, they never know.

2206
02:48:55,780 --> 02:48:55,980
Stealth.

2207
02:48:57,640 --> 02:48:59,660
And that's how you stealth, guys.

2208
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:03,240
Get out.

2209
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:09,920
All right, we gotta go.

2210
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:13,720
Is that dead body?

2211
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:17,800
What the fuck is that?

2212
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:22,500
Actually, spawned.

2213
02:49:22,760 --> 02:49:23,880
Where are you looking at?

2214
02:49:23,960 --> 02:49:24,360
Huh?

2215
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:25,820
That's right.

2216
02:49:26,140 --> 02:49:27,360
You're under arrest!

2217
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:29,760
Oh, shit.

2218
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:30,100
Wait.

2219
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:31,100
Oh, that's awkward.

2220
02:49:33,800 --> 02:49:35,700
I don't remember how to let go.

2221
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:40,800
Um...

2222
02:49:43,240 --> 02:49:43,640
I'm...

2223
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:48,020
I gotta go now.

2224
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:52,720
Goodbye.

2225
02:49:57,260 --> 02:49:59,780
It would be a good story to tell for her.

2226
02:50:00,180 --> 02:50:03,600
She'd be like, oh my god, girls, you guys wouldn't believe what just happened to me.

2227
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:04,760
I just got grabbed.

2228
02:50:06,620 --> 02:50:07,900
It'll be a good story.

2229
02:50:08,020 --> 02:50:09,040
Tell her friends.

2230
02:50:14,230 --> 02:50:14,650
Oh, nice.

2231
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:15,530
Parking lot.

2232
02:50:18,610 --> 02:50:19,710
Andrew, there you are.

2233
02:50:20,170 --> 02:50:21,030
Are you fucking crazy?

2234
02:50:21,470 --> 02:50:23,090
What the hell were you thinking wrestling Jackie?

2235
02:50:23,510 --> 02:50:25,110
Oh, I thought we were past all that.

2236
02:50:25,610 --> 02:50:28,090
I just wanted to congratulate you on that business with Tang.

2237
02:50:28,730 --> 02:50:29,250
Good riddance.

2238
02:50:30,270 --> 02:50:32,530
Now, what about Sunny Woe?

2239
02:50:32,630 --> 02:50:33,310
Anything new there?

2240
02:50:33,650 --> 02:50:34,790
What about Jackie, huh?

2241
02:50:35,070 --> 02:50:35,890
Fuck, Andrew.

2242
02:50:36,190 --> 02:50:36,850
Are you deaf?

2243
02:50:36,950 --> 02:50:37,710
No, Officer Shane.

2244
02:50:37,790 --> 02:50:38,150
I'm not.

2245
02:50:38,610 --> 02:51:10,230
but you clearly have forgotten who you're speaking to way forget about jackie a moment whatever we can get to stick to sunny woe will obviously hurt big smile lee and we both want that fine sunny had me put up a hidden camera in vivian lou's bedroom that means like the cops could access it too because we used cop stuff did have a reputation for that sort of thing think you could get a copy of that are you fucking kidding me She's got nothing to do with this shit.

2246
02:51:10,370 --> 02:51:12,090
This could be the piece that we're missing on Sonny.

2247
02:51:12,990 --> 02:51:13,850
Can you get it?

2248
02:51:15,130 --> 02:51:15,410
All right.

2249
02:51:16,630 --> 02:51:17,970
But I want Jackie in return.

2250
02:51:18,650 --> 02:51:19,350
Cut him loose.

2251
02:51:20,410 --> 02:51:20,810
Very well.

2252
02:51:21,890 --> 02:51:23,230
Get me the video and he walks.

2253
02:51:23,910 --> 02:51:24,430
I'll get it.

2254
02:51:25,270 --> 02:51:26,410
Yard of the deal.

2255
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:28,630
Get me that video.

2256
02:51:28,830 --> 02:51:29,890
I just put the video.

2257
02:51:30,190 --> 02:51:32,530
Wouldn't I still have the USB on me?

2258
02:51:33,910 --> 02:51:34,670
I literally...

2259
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:35,570
I don't understand.

2260
02:51:35,690 --> 02:51:38,130
Like, I use cop technology to...

2261
02:51:38,130 --> 02:51:51,190
to bug to bug the room so shouldn't the hkp like i'm that's what i'm using a cop app so shouldn't like shouldn't they already have access to it yeah

2262
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:25,240
they don't check my logs they want to respect my privacy dokey they're just trying to respect your privacy don't check your your stuff because i'm just thinking i'm like bro i used I use like, like, I use like police technology to hack it.

2263
02:52:25,380 --> 02:52:26,920
So shouldn't they be able to access it?

2264
02:52:27,480 --> 02:52:28,800
It's like police property.

2265
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:33,360
I'm literally using my HKPD app.

2266
02:52:34,660 --> 02:52:35,960
Just access my app.

2267
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:38,920
I was accessed.

2268
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:39,680
Sorry.

2269
02:52:40,020 --> 02:52:42,800
Sorry, I used the wrong, I was on my crime account.

2270
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:43,780
That's why.

2271
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:49,840
I was on the undercover cop account.

2272
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:56,620
Josh, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2273
02:52:56,680 --> 02:53:01,040

2274
02:53:02,860 --> 02:53:04,580
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2275
02:53:04,820 --> 02:53:06,100
Alright, how do I get there?

2276
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:08,800
Whoops.

2277
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:11,340
Got a loss.

2278
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:12,860
What?

2279
02:53:13,440 --> 02:53:14,740
Oh, it's my house.

2280
02:53:15,580 --> 02:53:16,620
I have to look at my...

2281
02:53:17,640 --> 02:53:18,840
I'm gonna look at my laptop.

2282
02:53:25,610 --> 02:53:26,470
Alright, here you go.

2283
02:53:27,230 --> 02:53:27,750

2286
02:53:40,220 --> 02:53:41,520
Yeah, I'm using NordVPN.

2287
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:43,360
The cops will never get me.

2288
02:53:43,400 --> 02:53:44,580
What are you doing here?

2289
02:53:44,740 --> 02:53:45,000
Whoa.

2290
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:46,980
Sonny says you've been really helpful to him.

2291
02:53:47,580 --> 02:53:48,620
And to me.

2292
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:51,400
And I just wanted to thank you.

2293
02:53:51,540 --> 02:53:51,800
Oh?

2294
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:52,980

02:53:56,280 --> 02:53:56,740
Wait, wait.

2297
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:58,280
What's this about?

2298
02:53:58,640 --> 02:53:59,160
Nothing.

2299
02:53:59,420 --> 02:54:00,380
I just...

2300
02:54:00,380 --> 02:54:00,920
Whoa!

2301
02:54:01,400 --> 02:54:03,820
I didn't consent.

2302
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:05,100
Sonny's gonna kill me.

2303
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:06,160
You gotta learn about consent.

2304
02:54:06,180 --> 02:54:45,880

Are we waiting at Central Mall?

2311
02:55:16,190 --> 02:55:17,310
What a cheapskate.

2312
02:55:17,570 --> 02:55:19,550
Sonny's a goddamn cheapskate.

2313
02:55:19,970 --> 02:55:21,070
Wait, did you bring the video?

2314
02:55:22,550 --> 02:55:23,050
And Jackie?

2315
02:55:23,470 --> 02:55:23,690
Done.

2316
02:55:25,210 --> 02:55:28,090
This should be all I need to put Sonny Wo away for a long time.

2317
02:55:28,530 --> 02:55:29,410
And with Uncle Po dead?

2318
02:55:29,470 --> 02:55:30,750
Wait, how'd you hear about that?

2319
02:55:31,270 --> 02:55:31,970
Good news.

2320
02:55:32,090 --> 02:55:32,870
Travels fast.

2321
02:55:33,630 --> 02:56:44,210

2323
02:56:59,820 --> 02:57:01,220
Yeah, they want someone they can control.

2324
02:57:06,460 --> 02:57:11,020
So they can have, like, exchange, like, information and deals and stuff.

2325
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,220
They look the other way if they work for him.

2326
02:57:15,060 --> 02:57:17,420
That's some fucking corrupt shit right there.

2327
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:22,920
Wait, guys, how much do I actually have left?

2328
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:26,180
This feels like I'm almost close to endgame.

2329
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:34,380
close to finishing the game

2330
02:57:38,890 --> 02:58:05,730

Man, there's so many drug buss out there.

2333
02:58:11,590 --> 02:58:14,090
I feel like they should find a cop to handle that.

2334
02:58:17,820 --> 02:58:19,940
Yeah, we're done when I say we're done.

2335
02:58:24,330 --> 02:58:25,170

02:58:46,510 --> 02:58:47,650
No, we're not cops.

2342
02:58:47,930 --> 02:58:49,270
We're cops, but we're undercover.

2343
02:58:51,290 --> 02:58:52,530
Alright, let's go turn in this.

2344

I'm gonna get that green cab.

2348
02:59:00,230 --> 02:59:00,610
Hello!

2349
02:59:03,050 --> 02:59:04,350

All right, get over here.

2362
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:05,240
I have four more statues to do.

2363
03:01:10,060 --> 03:01:11,320
My favorite technique.

2364
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:14,060
Yeah.

2365
03:01:23,690 --> 03:01:24,890

2366
03:01:24,950 --> 03:01:25,490
Wait, where am I?

2367
03:01:25,490 --> 03:01:26,390
Oh, I was going to save.

2368
03:01:27,050 --> 03:01:28,070
What the fuck happened?

2369
03:01:29,130 --> 03:01:33,410
I found one of your statues the ox you have done well.

2370
03:01:33,590 --> 03:01:38,890
Thank you for the statue It seems as though they're all finding their way back to me.

2371
03:01:39,230 --> 03:01:42,450
Yeah I did it destiny from the start.

2372
03:01:42,910 --> 03:01:43,790
What does that make me?

2373
03:01:44,050 --> 03:01:52,090
Oh, I've no doubt you'll return to Hong Kong Or affect many destinies Oh, yeah, I'm changing a lot of people's lives.

2374
03:01:52,590 --> 03:01:54,890
Surely that's why you came in the first place.

2375
03:01:55,270 --> 03:02:05,870
Maybe I just wanted to move back I'm the butterfly effect I decided to break my own rule and train a known triad for no reason whatsoever.

2376
03:02:06,370 --> 03:02:08,950
But I think we both know different.

2377
03:02:09,910 --> 03:02:11,610
Train a known triad.

2378
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:12,390
What would you like to learn?

2379
03:02:12,950 --> 03:02:15,430
Uh, I should actually not do anything.

2380
03:02:16,270 --> 03:02:16,270
Okay.

2381
03:02:16,750 --> 03:02:17,310
Yeah, sure.

2382
03:02:22,160 --> 03:02:24,800
X, X, X, X.

2383
03:02:25,200 --> 03:02:26,360
Oh shit!

2384
03:02:26,840 --> 03:02:28,720
Wait, that's a cool ass move.

2385
03:02:29,080 --> 03:02:29,680
That's right.

2386
03:02:29,860 --> 03:02:31,180
You ain't having nanny kids.

2387
03:02:31,360 --> 03:02:33,060
For a long time.

2388
03:02:33,440 --> 03:02:33,860
That's right.

2389
03:02:34,340 --> 03:02:34,760
Get up!

2390
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:35,740
Get up!

2391
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:38,280
That's right.

2392
03:02:38,660 --> 03:02:40,120
No children for you!

2393
03:02:41,280 --> 03:02:43,020
Get up, man!

2394
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:45,600
Get up!

2395
03:02:47,720 --> 03:02:50,620
Guys, I don't think like he's getting up, guys.

2396
03:02:54,590 --> 03:02:57,610
I don't think he wants to get up anymore.

2397
03:02:59,670 --> 03:03:00,970
There you go.

2398
03:03:02,830 --> 03:03:03,190
Alright.

2399
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:04,970
Sad.

2400
03:03:05,110 --> 03:03:06,230
I gotta speed run this.

2401
03:03:08,030 --> 03:03:09,210
Get on that wall!

2402
03:03:12,570 --> 03:03:13,270
Boom!

2403
03:03:18,390 --> 03:03:18,770
Boom!

2404
03:03:19,750 --> 03:03:21,070
That's five big booms.

2405
03:03:25,440 --> 03:03:25,700
Okay.

2406
03:03:27,080 --> 03:03:28,040
That's five.

2407
03:03:28,340 --> 03:03:29,220
This is faster.

2408
03:03:30,320 --> 03:03:31,660
This is a lot faster.

2409
03:03:31,660 --> 03:04:28,340
brain damage is faster than just kicking there you go see it's that easy it's my little speed run this is my speed run tech the wall poor wall it's my person it's my very own speed run tech that i figured out myself i found one of your statues the ball an important part of the collection you do in the states it makes you think i did anything different than what i'm doing now you have the feel of a man wait they give the super chat thank you thank you can commission doki plushie that when you squeeze the thing it does the doki laugh they give the super chat thank you that's a cute idea maybe maybe in the future it is a cute idea it's just more so like you I know that sound box is gonna die one day.

2410
03:04:29,980 --> 03:04:32,300
And it'll just sound like super fucking demonic.

2411
03:04:33,300 --> 03:04:38,120
And it's like when you get like an Elmo plushie and it's like, it's like it's calling for Satan.

2412
03:04:40,240 --> 03:04:41,420
Alright, it's time.

2413
03:04:41,940 --> 03:04:42,460
Speedrun tech.

2414
03:04:42,620 --> 03:04:43,900
Oh my god, the wall is...

2415
03:04:45,220 --> 03:04:47,400
Wait, the wall is...

2416
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:50,000
It still has the aftermath juice.

2417
03:04:52,480 --> 03:04:53,280
There you go.

2418
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:55,460
I can actually paint the wall as red.

2419
03:05:01,730 --> 03:05:03,610
Oh my god.

2420
03:05:04,110 --> 03:05:05,150
No, don't disobey me.

2421
03:05:05,310 --> 03:05:06,950
I'll paint the walls better, I swear.

2422
03:05:09,110 --> 03:05:09,910
Get over here.

2423
03:05:10,890 --> 03:05:11,990
The red walls.

2424
03:05:12,430 --> 03:05:13,030
There you go.

2425
03:05:14,930 --> 03:05:15,810
I'm an artist.

2426
03:05:17,050 --> 03:05:20,110
You're still recovering from your last visit.

2427
03:05:27,620 --> 03:05:28,420
All right.

2428
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:30,200
One more.

2429
03:05:30,860 --> 03:05:33,960
I found one of your statues.

2430
03:05:33,980 --> 03:06:06,980
the rooster good good you don't look well it's good for feng shui exactly that's where i learned it what do you plan to do about it it is what it is so if your punches are weak that means no that that's ways to walk is it true that through practice and concentration you can change some problems are harder to solve than a weak punch sifu watch my students for a minute you may change your mind i think the students are going to be changing their mind sifu i don't know I don't think they're having a good time of what I'm doing.

2431
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:12,320
Okay, one, two, three, four.

2432
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:14,040
Spin and kick!

2433
03:06:15,720 --> 03:06:18,060
One, two, three, four.

2434
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:19,700
Spin kick!

2435
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:23,240
One, two, three, four.

2436
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:24,480
Spin kick!

2437
03:06:25,380 --> 03:06:27,020
Alright, it's time.

2438
03:06:29,380 --> 03:06:31,100
I gotta spin that wall.

2439
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:33,360
The side has too much white on it.

2440
03:06:34,580 --> 03:06:36,660
It looks very uneven.

2441
03:06:36,900 --> 03:06:39,020
I gotta make sure everything's painted nicely.

2442
03:06:43,220 --> 03:06:44,720
There we go.

2443
03:06:45,620 --> 03:06:46,680
It's looking better now.

2444
03:06:50,760 --> 03:06:51,800
Only abstinence!

2445
03:06:55,380 --> 03:06:56,820
Get over here.

2446
03:06:56,880 --> 03:06:57,840
I gotta make sure.

2447
03:06:58,360 --> 03:06:59,040
There we go.

2448
03:06:59,120 --> 03:06:59,780
Look at that.

2449
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:01,080
Look at that wall.

2450
03:07:02,320 --> 03:07:03,960
That's a good ass wall now.

2451
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:09,380
Got my roundhouse kick.

2452
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:12,640
Alright.

2453
03:07:15,020 --> 03:07:15,420
What else?

2454
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:17,320
We'll do one last thing.

2455
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:23,600
Let us...

2456
03:07:23,600 --> 03:07:26,640
We'll do one last thing before we go.

2457
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:30,080
I need a cab.

2458
03:07:30,420 --> 03:07:31,920
I'm too lazy to drive right now.

2459
03:07:33,580 --> 03:07:33,940
Oh!

2460
03:07:33,980 --> 03:07:35,680
Is that cab over there?

2461
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:37,220
That's a cab over there.

2462
03:07:40,360 --> 03:07:43,240
We gotta do one last thing before we go.

2463
03:07:44,420 --> 03:07:44,720
Hello.

2464
03:07:46,800 --> 03:07:47,800
I think it's here?

2465
03:07:50,940 --> 03:07:51,140
Alright.

2466
03:07:51,860 --> 03:07:52,320
Nice.

2467
03:07:55,240 --> 03:07:58,800
Guys, I may or may not know where all the massage parlors are now.

2468
03:07:59,340 --> 03:08:03,960
I can look at the map and I'll know.

2469
03:08:03,980 --> 03:08:04,420
No.

2470
03:08:10,820 --> 03:08:13,980
I was like, yeah, I know there's a massage parlor right there.

2471
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:15,900
All right.

2472
03:08:16,820 --> 03:08:19,220
That was a hard, we had a hard day at work.

2473
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:20,460
We gotta relax.

2474
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:24,640
I know that, I know that massage parlor is like the back of my head.

2475
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:26,680
Might as well try everything once, right?

2476
03:08:27,160 --> 03:08:28,660
Yeah, this was my first time.

2477
03:08:29,420 --> 03:08:31,000
I may need to be disciplined.

2478
03:08:31,980 --> 03:08:32,400
Whoa!

2479
03:08:35,360 --> 03:08:36,360
Damn right.

2480
03:08:38,140 --> 03:08:39,960
I may just have to find a new job.

2481
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:42,800
You know what they say about coming with the customers.

2482
03:08:52,220 --> 03:08:53,900
Wow, that's a new line.

2483
03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:03,380
That...

2484
03:09:04,700 --> 03:09:06,360
What do they say?

2485
03:09:09,280 --> 03:09:10,280
I don't...

2486
03:09:10,280 --> 03:09:11,760
Guys, I may have a problem.

2489
03:10:16,400 --> 03:10:18,600
They are generated for you.

2490
03:10:20,220 --> 03:10:20,740

Thank you, thank you.

I think this is the right time to call it now.

2497
03:10:34,980 --> 03:10:39,440
I think next part would be the finale, right?

2498
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:42,100
I think it finished the game next week.

2499
03:10:43,460 --> 03:11:42,980

2501
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:44,800
My massage fighter!

2502
03:11:45,380 --> 03:11:45,560
Okay.

2503
03:11:46,220 --> 03:11:46,380
Wait.

2504
03:11:46,580 --> 03:11:48,580
I gotta have a perfect angle for this.

2505
03:11:50,700 --> 03:11:52,300
And then...

2506
03:11:52,300 --> 03:11:54,380
We're gonna...

2507
03:11:54,900 --> 03:11:55,420
Alright.

2508
03:11:55,640 --> 03:11:56,220
Oh my god.

2509
03:11:56,420 --> 03:11:56,780
The game.

2510
03:11:57,100 --> 03:11:57,780
The game.

2511
03:11:58,100 --> 03:11:59,500
It knows what I want.

2512
03:12:02,360 --> 03:12:06,260
But, there's less than four days left on the Gina.

2513
03:12:06,640 --> 03:12:10,280
The Gina draws X Go Keeper, a pair of collab.
