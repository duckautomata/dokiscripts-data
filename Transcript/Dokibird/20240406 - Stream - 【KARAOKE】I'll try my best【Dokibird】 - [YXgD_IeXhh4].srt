1
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,540
Everybody!

2
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,640
Calm down!

3
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm so sorry!

4
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
We took so long!

5
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,180
Guys!

6
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,380
I'm sorry everyone!

7
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,080
I know you guys waited for so long!

8
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,220
For 40 minutes!

9
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,540
I'm so sorry!

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,360
Look!

11
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,020
Look everybody!

12
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,240
I know, I know!

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,860
There was a lot more work than I thought when I did this... to do this karaoke.

14
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,440
I was like... I had so many ideas!

15
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,960
There was so many ideas in my head!

16
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,160
It was crazy!

17
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,940
And then I like... last minute I was like... wait!

18
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,540
I have more ideas!

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
And then... guys!

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Calm down!

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,580
Guys!

22
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,120
I know!

23
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,540
I know!

24
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,760
You've been waiting for 40 minutes!

25
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,740
Some of you guys haven't even...

26
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,820
I've been like... fucking standing there for 40 minutes already!

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,720
And we haven't even started!

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,820
But then I had more ideas!

29
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,820
And then I had to add stuff last minute to the set!

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,760
And then... oh my god!

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm so nervous!

32
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,360
I really am!

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,900
But we should... we should really... you know... we should... guys!

34
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,600
Camera!

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Close up camera!

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,940
Come back!

37
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,460
Come closer!

38
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,660
How are you gonna see me up there?

39
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,160
You know?

40
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,140
How are you gonna see me like this?

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,700
You know?

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,960
Alright!

43
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,720
Hello everybody!

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,480
Alright guys!

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,220
Okay!

46
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,700
I'm sorry!

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm so sorry!

48
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,400
You guys had to wait that...

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,920
You guys had to wait so long!

50
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm so sorry!

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,380
I... you know... I thought like... don't worry!

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,000
I have everything I need to do!

53
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,260
But then like... suddenly my mind was like... but like... wait!

54
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,180
There's more things I wanna do though!

55
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,120
And then... and then I had like... there's some fucking crazy ideas that I got some people to help out for us too!

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,680
So like... I'm... okay!

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,360
By the way!

58
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,980
Before you... for those who are new here who've never heard me sing...

59
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,460
I need to tell you guys like... I'm not a singer!

60
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,840
By no means am I a singer!

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,520
I like... basically make up for it with like... with making it like a show!

62
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,100
Because... although I can't sing... at least you'll have fun listening!

63
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,920
Like... not fun listening to my voice but like... with the visuals!

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,600
You know?

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,100
At least the visuals will be...

66
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,100
you know?

67
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,800
It will be nice!

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:28,640
I like to say I am... I am a... the type of singer that you will not see me at karaoke because that's how embarrassed I am...

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,900
To my... at my own singing.

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,560
But!

71
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,440
I did promise you guys a karaoke as a charity reward.

72
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,180
So here... here I am!

73
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,040
I am... I am very, very, very, very, very nervous right now!

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,740
It's been a very long time since... I guess you can say I sing with soul.

75
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,200
You know?

76
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,180
You don't come to me to hear good singing.

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,620
You come to me to... I guess to laugh at my singing I guess.

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
Anyway... um...

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm gonna spoil the first song because I have to wear a little something for this song.

80
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,240
And also I need to... I need soundcheck guys to be here to check out the volume of this as well.

81
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,300
So if... soundcheck guy are you here?

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,620
Are you here soundcheck guy?

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,560
Let me see... is... is soundcheck guy here?

84
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,900
We need... I need to be sure that the... the sound is okay.

85
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,900
Alright... okay... we're gonna spoil... we're gonna spoil the... the first song chat.

86
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,660
Just cause I need to know if you guys could hear it.

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,220
It will be spoiled by the first song chat.

88
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,060
Is this okay?

89
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,220
Alright so you sort of know what song this is now.

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,020
This is a... this is a Doki Bird classic.

91
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,020
Cause this is the only... this is like one of the... the five songs I'm like super confident in.

92
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,860
Alright...

93
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,500
Let me... let me...

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,340
Put on something as well.

95
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,180
Alright...

96
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,220
I'm gonna...

97
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,220
I'm gonna...

98
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,860
Alright it's pretty quiet.

99
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,920
Let me bring it up.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,340
Alright thank you soundcheck guy.

101
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,560
I'm glad we had soundcheck guy here to help us out.

102
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,740
But anyway let's just... let's put us...

103
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,780
Put our little costume on real quick.

104
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,640
Let's put it...

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,000
And...

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,080
Since we know what song this is.

107
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Alright is this better?

108
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,780
Is this better soundcheck guy?

109
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,580
Is this better?

110
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,940
Is this better?

111
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,220
I like... I'm like just like...

112
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,920
Fucking edging with like...

113
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,060
With not even singing this.

114
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm back now guy.

115
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,180
Okay I'm back now.

116
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,660
That was so funny because it was like...

117
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,160
What do you mean?

118
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,500
It's YouTube cause I...

119
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,200
My OBS is still up.

120
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,160
And then like... and then it crashed the moment I...

121
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,140
Like I typed that.

122
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,460
Anyway let's do this again.

123
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,600
Is this song okay?

124
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,960
Is it okay now?

125
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,780
Is it okay now?

126
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,360
Is it okay?

127
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,920
That was awkward.

128
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,300
That was awkward.

129
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,040
I like how...

130
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,880
I like how fucking...

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,780
Uh...

132
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,000
It's still pretty quiet.

133
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,220
Okay I'll push it up.

134
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,680
Alright.

135
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,540
Oh it's cause like...

136
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,920
Oh it's cause it reset itself.

137
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,440
It's cause it reset itself when my OBS crashed.

138
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,220
Alright we're back.

139
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,480
Ba da ba ba da da da.

140
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,220
Ba ba ba da da da.

141
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,620
Ba da ba ba da da da.

142
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,080
Ba da ba ba da da da.

143
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,680
Ba ba dum ba ba da da dum.

144
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,200
Ba dum ba ba da da dum.

145
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,220
Ba dum ba ba da da dum.

146
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,520
Ba dum ba ba da... Is it better now?

147
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,000
Ba dum ba da da da dum.

148
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,680
I like how we're just good here.

149
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,040
Alright!

150
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
This is it.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,280
Finally!

152
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,920
Sorry everybody!

153
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,540
Finally!

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
We can fucking...

155
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
We can finally sing!

156
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,880
Alright are you guys ready?

157
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,320
Alright we're back.

158
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,340
We're so back.

159
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,000
I hear you.

160
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,420
Oh, that's mean.

161
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,320
No one's saying be there.

162
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,820
No one's saying stop that.

163
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,160
No one's saying see here.

164
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,540
Free to run around all day.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,460
Free to do it all my way.

166
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,160
Yeah!

167
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,620
I'm the king!

168
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,660
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start.

169
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,280
If this is where the monarchy is headed, come here!

170
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,720
What?

171
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
Out of service, out of our hands.

172
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,120
Why wouldn't you hand about?

173
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,100
This child is getting wildly out of way.

174
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,460
That's me!

175
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,220
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

176
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,120
Everybody look left.

177
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,440
Everybody look right.

178
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,340
And where you look, I'm...

179
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,300
Satisfactlight!

180
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:44,920
Huh?

181
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
There's everything to go for broken sea.

182
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,540
Let's hear it if

183
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,400
we can see the finest thing.

184
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,420
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

185
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,120
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

186
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:16,740
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

187
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,400
Woo!

188
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
That's me!

189
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,060
That's me!

190
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,720
That's me!

191
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,720
I'm the king!

192
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,000
I went with the...

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,100
I went with the...

194
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,120
The... The... The safest choice for the first song because, uh...

195
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,300
I know that...

196
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,400
This was a song I sang a lot as a little... As a little bird.

197
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,120
So, like, that's why I decided to go with, like, the safest choice.

198
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,840
That's the first song.

199
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:07,180
Because I know that, like, um... I say... I know the song, like, really, really, really, really well because I've listened to the song on repeat ever since I was little.

200
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,080
So I was like, alright, this is... This is gonna be the first song I'll sing then because I... I... I know this.

201
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:22,580
I mean, it's a good... It's a... It's a good warm-up song because it's like, oh, man, out of every song, I know this one is the one that, like, I have, like, the most confidence in.

202
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,540
So, yeah.

203
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,220
The very first song.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Um...

205
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,640
But, yes, if you guys... I don't know.

206
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,920
Never heard of Disney before.

207
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,560
The very first song I sang was...

208
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,620
I just...

209
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,580
Can't...

210
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,200
Wait...

211
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,800
To be...

212
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,560
King...

213
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,280
From Lion King.

214
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,680
Where's my little...

215
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,220
There it is.

216
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,180
This is my set list.

217
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
The very first song I sang.

218
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,320
I just can't wait to be king.

219
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,080
Yes, there is gonna be a lot... I'm gonna warn you guys right now.

220
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:04,760
There's gonna be a lot of... of Disney songs because, like, uh, Disney songs is, like, the songs I'm most confident in when it comes to singing.

221
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,520
Uh, so that's why...

222
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,460
I decided...

223
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,300
It's majority Disney.

224
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,260
Uh...

225
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,220
Majority of the stuff in here is... is Disney.

226
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,280
So, just... just a little warning.

227
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,260
Um...

228
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,880
Give me a sec.

229
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,580
I'm trying to grab my set list right now.

230
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,580
I think I realize what's causing the... the crashing a little bit.

231
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,980
And it's because of...

232
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,580
Uh...

233
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,600
I use... uh...

234
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,360
I use KaraFun for, like, my karaoke stuff.

235
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
And it's so fucking... I guess it overloads... overloads...

236
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,440
It overloads my Discord for some fucking reason.

237
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,040
Which doesn't make much sense because I'm like, why does KaraFun overload my Discord?

238
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,020
So I'm just gonna grab my set list off of...

239
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,800
Because I wrote my set list off of Discord.

240
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,600
So I'm gonna grab my set list and put it somewhere else so I know where it is.

241
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,060
So I know which to go next.

242
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,860
Okay, let me...

243
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,220
Let me make sure I can...

244
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,640
Let me post this somewhere so...

245
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,420
So I can look at my set list.

246
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,820
Until I solve this whenever.

247
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,940
Because like...

248
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,980
It's awkward because like...

249
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,180
I was like, what do I sing next?

250
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
I already forgot what to sing next!

251
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,880
I'm so nervous!

252
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,820
I'm so nervous right now!

253
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,840
And I'm forgetting things at the moment!

254
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,560
OH!

255
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,580
Okay, I remember now.

256
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,940
Guys, this one.

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,720
This one is also a classic that I like, too.

258
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,980
Uh, let me...

259
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,980
Alright, you guys might know...

260
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,120
What it is...

261
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,920
Judging from...

262
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,980
What I'm wearing...

263
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,300
Soon.

264
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,020
Very soon.

265
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,900
Uh...

266
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,400
Okay, now you know what it is.

267
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,160
Okay...

268
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,300
If you guys can recognize the first two notes of that song, you might know what it is.

269
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:56,920
This is also a classic that I don't sing this as often, but I do like it very very much.

270
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,380
I'm following my destiny.

271
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,040
How bad can I be?

272
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,400
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

273
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,900
How bad can I be?

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,020
How bad can I possibly be?

275
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,900
Something of principle in nature.

276
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,820
That almost every creature knows.

277
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
Called survival of the fittest.

278
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,760
And checkin' is how it goes.

279
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,620
The animal that wins is gonna scratch and fight and claw and fight and punch.

280
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,400
And the animal that doesn't, well the animal that doesn't, well that...

281
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,540
Someone else.

282
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:45,700
Someone else.

283
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,680
Nudge nudge nudge nudge nudge...

284
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,380
I'm just saying how bad can I be?

285
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,700
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

286
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,240
How bad can I be?

287
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,500
I'm just following my destiny.

288
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,140
How bad can I be?

289
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,500
I'm just doing what comes naturally.

290
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,040
How bad can I be?

291
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,200
How bad can I possibly be?

292
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,980
It's a principle in business.

293
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,880
That everybody knows the sound.

294
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,900
This is the people with the money!

295
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,620
Make this everworld go around!

296
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,660
So I'm figuring my companies, I'm figuring my factory, I'm figuring my corporate sign!

297
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,380
Everybody out there, you take care of yours and me.

298
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll take care of mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!

299
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,320
Let me hear you say, smogulent smoke!

300
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,740
Slippily stop!

301
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,340
Complain all you want, it's never ever ever gonna stop!

302
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,100
Come on!

303
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,980
How bad can I possibly be?

304
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,580
I'm just building economy.

305
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,520
How bad can I be?

306
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,820
Just look at me paying this puppy!

307
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,560
How bad can I be?

308
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,760
Come on!

309
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,360
How bad can I be?

310
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,480
How bad can I possibly be?

311
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,500
Let's see...

312
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,420
All the customers are buying!

313
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,140
And the money's multiplying!

314
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,160
And the PR people are lying!

315
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,860
And the lawyers are denying!

316
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,260
Who cares if a few trees are dying?

317
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,040
This is all so gratifying!

318
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,880
How bad...

319
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,760
How bad can this possibly be?

320
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,900
Haha!

321
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,540
Alright, my time's up!

322
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,220
I'm a good person!

323
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,380
Haha!

324
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,840
Hehehe!

325
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,560
Hehehe!

326
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,480
Oh yeah, I think I'm a pretty good person guys!

327
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,480
Hahaha!

328
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,060
Hehehe!

329
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,660
Anyway, that was how bad can I be?

330
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
from Mr. Ed Helms himself.

331
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,620
One of the OG Tumblr boys out there.

332
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,060
What capitalism does to a tomato.

333
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,280
Shout out to the Onceler.

334
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,140
The OG Tumblr boy.

335
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,200
Let me take these off.

336
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,960
How bad can I possibly be?

337
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,140
A lot of these songs I chose are like super in my vocal range.

338
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,240
Or like I forced it to be in my vocal range.

339
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,140
Because I have a very, very small vocal range.

340
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,420
So just letting you guys know.

341
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,100
I'm not even going to write numbers right now.

342
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm too lazy.

343
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
It's like 1.

344
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,920
I just can't wait to be king.

345
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,520
2.

346
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,180
How bad can I possibly be?

347
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,660
Not even 2.

348
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,240
How bad can I be?

349
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,720
But yes.

350
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,040
I hope your ears are okay chat.

351
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,300
I know that...

352
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,240
You know...

353
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,920
I'm not a singer.

354
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,460
So I hope everybody's ears are okay so far.

355
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,420
And no one is...

356
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,100
No one is dying at the moment.

357
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,680
But it's true.

358
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,140
As YouTube keeps dying...

359
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,120
Everybody's against me.

360
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
Oh my God.

361
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,240
I can't believe YouTube's dying.

362
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,480
They know.

363
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,420
They're like...

364
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,860
Doki has a karaoke.

365
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,980
Doki has a karaoke today.

366
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,080
So like...

367
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,240
We're gonna f*** with her.

368
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,940
They're like...

369
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,180
Well...

370
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,360
We're gonna fuck with her!

371
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,160
They're trying to silence the Tumblr sexy man agenda.

372
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,780
They know!

373
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,920
OBS knows I had a karaoke... YouTube knows I had a karaoke today!

374
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,660
They're trying to silence me!

375
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,620
Anyway guys, the next song is also a classic.

376
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,720
I have something special too for the next song.

377
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,680
It's one of the reasons why this took a while to prep for.

378
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm gonna fumble with this because I didn't get to practice this as much as I would like to.

379
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,340
So I'm gonna fumble this song.

380
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,280
Well to be fair, when I said I didn't practice this much, I definitely didn't practice a lot for this one.

381
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,980
But I really really wanted to do it.

382
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,600
You're gonna realize what song this is the moment I swap the scenes.

383
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,580
You're gonna realize what song this is.

384
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,280
Chat, are you guys ready?

385
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,920
Okay, I don't know if you guys can hear the video though.

386
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,560
So let me know if you guys actually hear the video.

387
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:04,660
Okay, I don't know if you guys can hear the video though.

388
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:04,660
So let me know if you guys actually hear the video.

389
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,040
So let me know if you guys actually hear the video.

390
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,100
Do you guys actually hear this?

391
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,780
Do you guys actually hear this?

392
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,400
You guys can't?

393
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,800
Okay.

394
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,880
Okay, I thought you guys can.

395
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,720
Okay, I need to try to find...

396
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,720
Alright, there we go.

397
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,060
Do you guys see?

398
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,160
You guys can't hear the song?

399
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,940
Okay, thank God.

400
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,740
Good.

401
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,900
Because that song is my guide.

402
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,960
Good.

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because that song is my guide.

404
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,720
Good.

405
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Because that song is my guide.

406
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,040
That's good.

407
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,540
That's good.

408
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,920
Cause that song is my guide for this.

409
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,920
Okay, so there's a reason why this took so long.

410
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,420
Welcome to the Dragoon PTA meeting.

411
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,480
Welcome to the Dragoon PTA meeting.

412
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,320
I have a...

413
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,400
I have a very, very, very important news to tell all of you.

414
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,060
I have a very, very, very important news to tell all of you.

415
00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:01,860
The reason why I summoned all of you guys is that there is something very fucking important that I need to address right now and it's about the children.

416
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,280
it's about the children.

417
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,100
it's about the children.

418
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,360
I need you guys to know, this is very important to me.

419
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,180
Because this is about the kids.

420
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,160
And we need to do something about it, okay?

421
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,940
I summoned all of you here because...

422
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,580
I feel like we have to...

423
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,200
There is something really bad going around.

424
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,500
That's affecting all our children and dragoons.

425
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,360
And that is why I am here today to summon...

426
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,660
I summoned all of you here today for this very important dragoon PTA meeting.

427
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,320
As you guys see, I have a DokiBirds plan of action.

428
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,040
I need to make sure I sync this video up correctly so it works.

429
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,560
So give me a second to sync this video up.

430
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,180
Okay.

431
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,920
I need to make sure this video is synced up.

432
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:05,980
Okay.

433
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,600
Alright, let's see.

434
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,600
I hope this is synced up.

435
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm not sure yet.

436
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,300
Alright, we're gonna try our best.

437
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,160
We're gonna try our best.

438
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,600
Times have changed.

439
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,200
Our kids are getting worse.

440
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,840
They won't obey their parents.

441
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,380
They just want to fight and curse.

442
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,980
Should we blame the government?

443
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,940
AHHHHH NO!

444
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,920
It's not synced up guys!

445
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Oh my god!

446
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,460
My OBS disconnected!

447
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
Oh my god!

448
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,040
I can't believe it!

449
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,420
I saw my OBS disconnected and I was like, bro...

450
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,340
This is... everything's against me.

451
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,820
YouTube's actually trolling me.

452
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,760
YouTube's actually trolling me today.

453
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,000
I can't believe it!

454
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,400
YouTube!

455
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,720
I worked so hard on this!

456
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,440
YouTube!

457
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,160
Why today?

458
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
I can't believe it.

459
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,980
YouTube's actually trolling me right now.

460
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,480
Alright, here we go.

461
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,160
We'll try again.

462
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
We'll try again guys.

463
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:21,980
This time.

464
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,860
YouTube, please let me finish this song.

465
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,260
This is Katniss' fault.

466
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,940
This is fucking Katniss' fault.

467
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,900
This is actually Katniss' fault.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,440
We'll try again.

469
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,700
Alright, here we go.

470
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,540
Times have changed!

471
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,080
Our kids are getting worse!

472
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,760
They won't obey their parents!

473
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,180
They just want to fart and curse!

474
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,900
Should we blame the government?

475
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,720
Or blame society?

476
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,460
Or should we blame the Queen of the City?

477
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,600
NO!

478
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,700
Blame Canada!

479
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,960
Blame Canada!

480
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,680
With all their beady little eyes, their flopping heads, and playful eyes.

481
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,640
Blame Canada!

482
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,220
Blame Canada!

483
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,360
We need to form a full assault!

484
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,160
It's Katniss' fault!

485
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,220
Don't blame me for my sun dragoon!

486
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,260
He saw the darn cartoon, and now he's off to join the clan!

487
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,440
And my boy Eric once, had a picture on his shelf!

488
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,620
But now I see him tell me to fuck myself!

489
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,920
Well, blame Canada!

490
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,920
Blame Canada!

491
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,700
It seems that everything's gone wrong Since Katniss came along!

492
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,700
Blame Canada!

493
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,240
Blame Canada!

494
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,900
Not even a real country anyway.

495
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,200
My son could have been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true.

496
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,100
Instead he burned up like a piggy on a barbecue.

497
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,980
Should we blame the matches?

498
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,500
Should we blame the fire?

499
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,680
Or the doctors who allow him to inspire?

500
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,520
Heck no!

501
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,580
Blame Canada!

502
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,960
Blame Canada!

503
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,820
With all their hocky holler boo and that bitch dokey bird too.

504
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,740
Blame Canada!

505
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,440
Shame on Canada!

506
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,680
The smut we must cut, the trash we must smash.

507
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,220
The laughter and fun must all be undone.

508
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,820
We must blame them and cause the fuss before someone thinks of blaming us!

509
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,860
Yes.

510
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,780
There you go.

511
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,860
Anyway, thank you YouTube for letting me sing this song.

512
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,240
YouTube, thank you for letting me get through this video so I could sing this song, YouTube.

513
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,640
Huge shout out to one of my editors, Shad, for doing this.

514
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,480
Literally, he sent me this like 10 minutes ago.

515
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,500
I had this idea like... well, I had several ideas.

516
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,420
But this one, I had this idea like in the morning.

517
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,480
And I was like, Shad, can you do this?

518
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,800
And then they were like, I can try.

519
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,940
And then they actually sent this to me like 10 minutes ago.

520
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,920
And...

521
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,920
A huge, huge shout out to them for this.

522
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,000
I had this set up thing made in advance.

523
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,260
And I was like, don't worry.

524
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,160
I won't be singing Blame Canada until later.

525
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,820
So like... so send it to me whenever it's done.

526
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,980
So anyway, for those who don't know.

527
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,800
This was Blame Canada from South Park.

528
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,320
Thank you for coming to my Dragoon PTA meeting.

529
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,280
I really appreciate it.

530
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,060
And I just want to say like this is all Katniss' fault.

531
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,300
That the karaoke has been like crashing this much.

532
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,380
And I'm really sorry.

533
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,740
I'm not sorry because this is Katniss' fault.

534
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,060
So fuck you, Canada, for crashing my PC.

535
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,860
For crashing my YouTube, my OBS, and my PC.

536
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,680
Look, I worked so hard on this karaoke.

537
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,140
Fucking Canada, man.

538
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,780
Anyway, it's time to go back to the...

539
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,700
Alright, anyway, meeting's adjourned.

540
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,000
Meeting's adjourned.

541
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,100
Back to the concert hall.

542
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,080
Well, back to the concert hall.

543
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,780
Hey.

544
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm back.

545
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,420
Anyway, guys.

546
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,500
That song was...

547
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,260
Blame Canada.

548
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,840
From South Park.

549
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,240
Alright, this next one.

550
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,140
This one I've been wanting to sing for a very, very...

551
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,160
Very, very, very, very, very long time.

552
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,300
I never ever had a chance to sing this song.

553
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,420
Because it's sort of...

554
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,540
It's not really obscure.

555
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,500
It's more like internet stuff.

556
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,580
It's like...

557
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,640
It's sort of like if you were on the internet when this came out.

558
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
Like it was everywhere.

559
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,060
And like it was...

560
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,140
It's based off of a...

561
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,800
It's like a...

562
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,340
A mini project starring a lot of like really big celebrities back then.

563
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,680
But it was like a fucking passion project.

564
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,700
And...

565
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,300
But like...

566
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,880
It was like...

567
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,460
You know...

568
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,380
It didn't really have like actual music rights.

569
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,640
Or anything.

570
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,580
So I never had a chance to really sing this song.

571
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,260
And this is like a song I really...

572
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,880
I really, really wanted to sing for a while now.

573
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,860
Anyway, so...

574
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
I think...

575
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,060
The best way to do this is if I...

576
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,200
Is if I...

577
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,820
Got the spotlight on...

578
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,100
Put this on.

579
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,480
And you'll realize why.

580
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,820
You'll realize why I put the spotlight on for this song.

581
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,410
Alright...

582
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,810
Look at these people amazing how sheep will show up for the slaughter.

583
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,990
No one's condemning you line up like lemons you'll lead to the water.

584
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,150
Why can't they see what I see?

585
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,210
Why can't they hear the lies?

586
00:29:52,670 --> 00:30:16,150
Maybe the fee's too pricey for them to realize Your disguise is slipping I think you're slipping Now that your savior is still as a grave, you're beginning to fear me Like caveman fear thunder, I still have to wonder, can you really hear me?

587
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:33,430
I bring you pain, the kind you can't suffer quietly Fire up your brain, remind you inside you're wrining Society is slipping Hey guys...

588
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,660
Oh my god...

589
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,600
Okay, I downloaded the program.

590
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,140
Maybe...

591
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,100
This will be better.

592
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,840
Oh my god...

593
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,860
Guys, I can't believe it.

594
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,560
Are you guys ready for round two?

595
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,140
Are you guys ready for round two?

596
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,360
Are you guys ready?

597
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,320
Oh my god...

598
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,440
The stream slipped.

599
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,020
Okay.

600
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,120
Are you guys ready for round two, chat?

601
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm ready for round two.

602
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,280
I'm ready for round two.

603
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,180
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

604
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,080
It really is slipping.

605
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,740
It really is.

606
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
Alright, here we go.

607
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,720
Here we go again.

608
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,560
Stop it, Canada, please.

609
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,120
Alright, let's see if this works.

610
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,800
Is the volume okay for this?

611
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,260
So I use the program right now.

612
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm using a program this time.

613
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,180
Alright, here we go.

614
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,700
Take two.

615
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,920
Anyway...

616
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,480
Look at these people.

617
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,600
Amazing how sheep will show up for the slaughter.

618
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,040
No one's condemning you.

619
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,260
Line up like lemons.

620
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,840
You lead to the water.

621
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,940
Why can't they see what I see?

622
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,980
Why can't they hear the lies?

623
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,740
Maybe the fee's too pricey for them to realize.

624
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,580
Your disguise is slipping.

625
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,620
I think you're slipping.

626
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,700
Now that your savior is still as a grave, you're beginning to fear me.

627
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,840
Like caveman fear thunder, I still have to wonder, can you really hear me?

628
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,180
I bring you pain, the kind you can't suffer quietly.

629
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:37,260
I up your brain, remind you inside your writing, society is slipping.

630
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,400
Everything's slipping away.

631
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,300
So...

632
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,020
Go ahead, right away, say it was horrible.

633
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,820
Spread the word, tell a friend, tell them the tale.

634
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,120
Get a pet, do a bug, heroes are over with.

635
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,620
Look at him, not a word, hammer me, nail.

636
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,900
Then I win, then I get everything I ever.

637
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,540
All the cash, all the fame, and so, so change.

638
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,220
Anarchy, better run, it's Dr. Horrible's turn.

639
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,200
You people all have to learn.

640
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,000
This world is going to burn.

641
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,480
Burn.

642
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,440
Uh, yeah, it's two R's.

643
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,600
H-O-R-R, yeah, right.

644
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,280
Burn.

645
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,580
No sign of any good, I won't give any, not to have surcing.

646
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,600
It's gonna be bloody, head up, Billy, buddy, there's no time for mercy.

647
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,080
Here goes no mercy.

648
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,000
And then I get punched.

649
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,160
Oh my god, maybe that was the way, I just need to...

650
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,560
Alright, guys, let's all expect to crash every two...

651
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,100
Guys, I'm gonna say it now, this is gonna be unarchived.

652
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,360
This is what just...

653
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,340
I'm sorry.

654
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,360
This is...

655
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,640
Way too fucking scuffed, this is gonna be unarchived.

656
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,580
We're crashing too much, we're crashing way too much.

657
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,080
Maybe whenever I get a new PC, we're going to...

658
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,520
We'll have another karaoke and bring back the...

659
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,860
At least you guys are lucky, you've made it, though.

660
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,800
You've made it.

661
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,840
Anyway, for those who don't know what that song is, it is Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog.

662
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,860
It's called Slipping.

663
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:43,880
And Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog was one of my favorite animated series for...

664
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,760
It wasn't a series, no, it was an anime movie.

665
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,820
It was a small animated movie project that was a passion project.

666
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,340
It had almost no budget.

667
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,560
But a lot of people were really...

668
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,900
It became a cult hit, basically.

669
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,640
It was a cult hit.

670
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,060
And it started Neil Patrick Harris and then the other people...

671
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,140
I don't remember the other...

672
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,820
Sorry, not animated, sorry.

673
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,560
Not animated, live action.

674
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I mean, fucking what do you mean live action?

675
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,380
It was just a mini movie project.

676
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,520
And honestly, I loved every song.

677
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,120
I still love, by the way, I still love every fucking song that was in that album.

678
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,340
And there was like...

679
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,780
I think like Freeze Ray honestly was...

680
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,360
Oh yeah, Felicia Day.

681
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,540
Yeah, Felicia Day was in it.

682
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,480
Freeze Ray is one of my favorite...

683
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,300
Freeze Day...

684
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,780
Freeze Ray is one of my favorite songs in that movie.

685
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,760
But I know I can't sing Freeze Ray because Freeze Ray is mostly singing.

686
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,500
And I was like, nope.

687
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,400
It was...

688
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,240
I was like, nope.

689
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,860
I can't sing Freeze Ray.

690
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,660
So like I'll just do Slipping.

691
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,040
Because Slipping is also one of my favorite songs.

692
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,380
And Brand New Day too.

693
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,340
Almost every song in there is like...

694
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,480
Like, never mind, not almost.

695
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:10,220
All the songs in Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog is so fucking good.

696
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,580
And I'm so happy to do Slipping.

697
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,360
It's one of the songs I've always wanted to sing.

698
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,720
So I'm glad I was actually able to sing it here today for you guys.

699
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm sorry for the scuff.

700
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,220
I didn't realize fucking...

701
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,600
It never happened before.

702
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,520
Like all these crashes on Karaoke Day.

703
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,520
They knew!

704
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,600
YouTube and OBS knew!

705
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,580
Okay, guys.

706
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,240
Alright.

707
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,940
Spoiler.

708
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,840
I'm actually getting a new PC.

709
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,540
But like it's stuck in customs.

710
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,760
It's been stuck in customs for two weeks now.

711
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,120
Bro, every day I wait and I was like, which one will be here?

712
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,160
And it's been stuck in customs for like...

713
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,380
Fucking Canada!

714
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,680
This is Canada's fault!

715
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,600
It's always Canada's fault!

716
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,740
God fucking damn it!

717
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,060
I could have had my new PC by now!

718
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,840
God damn it, Canada!

719
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,840
Anyway.

720
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,680
Yes.

721
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,280
Thank you for listening to...

722
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,980
Okay, let me fucking...

723
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,060
Where's my karaoke list?

724
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
Alright, here we go.

725
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,300
That was...

726
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,460
Slipping.

727
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,340
I can't believe I crashed.

728
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,200
Okay, we're just gonna expect crashes.

729
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,600
I don't wanna promise anything.

730
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,020
So like we're just...

731
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,500
I don't wanna be like...

732
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,120
Don't worry.

733
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,360
It's okay now because I...

734
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't know.

735
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
It might not be okay.

736
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,880
So I don't promise anything yet.

737
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,920
Anyway, let me bring my piano over.

738
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,420
Boom.

739
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,740
I can't play piano by the way, but let me bring my piano over.

740
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,400
I don't know how to play the piano, but like let me bring my piano over here.

741
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,640
All my favorites still.

742
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,800
Okay, all these songs...

743
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,280
Okay, I'm...

744
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,460
I'm just not saying one of my favorites because technically all these songs are my favorite.

745
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,340
All of them are my favorites.

746
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,520
So there's no actually...

747
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,940
Like everything on here is one of my favorite songs.

748
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,160
So I need to stop saying one of my favorites.

749
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:23,920
All right.

750
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,860
I got my piano.

751
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,420
I'm singing this version because I don't like the original singer.

752
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,560
Okay, I like the original singer, but like I don't like...

753
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,340
I prefer this version more so than the original singer's version.

754
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:47,740
So you might know because I sang this before, but I still love it because I feel like the message is like really powerful.

755
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,820
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,500
No, I love it.

757
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,300
You can never know what it's like.

758
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,000
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice.

759
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,720
And there's a cold lonely night that shines from you.

760
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,100
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use.

761
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,960
And did you think that thrill could never win?

762
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,100
Well, look at me.

763
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,620
I'm coming back again.

764
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,400
I got taste of love in a simple way.

765
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,460
And you need to know why I'm still sad and you just fade away.

766
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,880
I'm still standing, yeah,

767
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,300
yeah, yeah.

768
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,740
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

769
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,620
Once I never could hope to win.

770
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,180
You staring down the road leaving me again.

771
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,000
The threats you made were meant to cut me down.

772
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,320
If our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now.

773
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,680
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did.

774
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,320
Looking like a true survivor.

775
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,200
Feeling like a little kid.

776
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,900
And I'm still standing after all this time.

777
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,500
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.

778
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,800
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,260
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

780
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,460
Yeah.

781
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,920
Pew pew pew pew pew pew.

782
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,140
Pretend that my piano can also do guitar solos.

783
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,880
Pew pew pew pew.

784
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,760
Pew pew pew pew.

785
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,700
It's an electric piano.

786
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,300
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did.

787
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,960
Looking like a true survivor.

788
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,800
Feeling like a little kid.

789
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,460
And I'm still standing.

790
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,620
After all this time.

791
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,140
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.

792
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,920
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

794
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,460
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,960
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,540
Woooo!

797
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,840
Alright, for those who don't know what that song was, that was, uh, I'm still stand- I don't know.

798
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,520
For those who still don't know what that is, who would've known?

799
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,340
That was I'm Still Standing by Elton John, but also- but I didn't sing Elton John's version.

800
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,080
Cause I like the sing- the movie- movie sing version from Taron Egerton.

801
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,360
Um, who also played Elton John on his, like, biopic movie.

802
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,440
Uh, I honestly prefer his version so much more.

803
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,840
Um, especially in the sing one when he's a gorilla.

804
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,720
Uh, and it's- it's been one of my favorite songs, like, for a very long time.

805
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,060
So I am very happy to be able to sing this.

806
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,200
Anyway, let me chuck this piano out.

807
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,960
Thank you.

808
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,840
Thank you, piano.

809
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:41,680
I- I really appreciated piano for, uh, uh, for doing that.

810
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,940
Okay, I'm still standing.

811
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,800
I really appreciate the piano that I could totally play.

812
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,460
Chat.

813
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,600
The piano that I'm- I'm def- I definitely played, uh, uh, in front of all of you guys.

814
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,040
Alright, next song!

815
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,080
Next song.

816
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,080
Okay, ooh, okay.

817
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,240
This one is- this one's gonna be fun.

818
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,240
This one's gonna be fun.

819
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,060
You guys might enjoy this.

820
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,840
But, like, I need to time it- time- time the video.

821
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,240
This one also has a video chat.

822
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,220
So, you guys might enjoy this.

823
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,500
Let me...

824
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,060
Let me put this- let me find the song real quick.

825
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,520
Uh, I need to make sure it's the right version.

826
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,140
I need to time this- time this video as well.

827
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,920
But we're gonna move, guys.

828
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,240
We're gonna, uh...

829
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,040
We're gonna move to another- another setup real fast.

830
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,480
Guys, alright, all of you guys, out the concert hall.

831
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,340
Out the concert hall, everybody.

832
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,380
We're gonna go somewhere.

833
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,700
Alright, you guys all ready?

834
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,760
I know there's so many of you guys.

835
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,300
Out, out.

836
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,240
We're gonna move to another venue real quick.

837
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,080
But we'll come back.

838
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,000
We'll come back to this venue.

839
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,640
I just need you guys to all move out right now.

840
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,940
Alright, three, two, one.

841
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:52,860
Pew!

842
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,340
Alright.

843
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:55,780
Okay.

844
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,820
So, I need to make sure that, uh...

845
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,240
Alright, here we go.

846
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,720
I need to make sure I timed this correctly.

847
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,200
Alright, so, here's our new venue.

848
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,220
Don't worry.

849
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,860
There is a reason why we're in this venue.

850
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,740
Because the next song that we're singing requires a big- bigger venue.

851
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,420
Like, I need all this open space.

852
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,300
Uh...

853
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,100
I...

854
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,920
I really need all this open space for- for this particular venue.

855
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,180
And you're gonna realize when we're here.

856
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
But I need to make sure the video is timed correctly.

857
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,560
So, that is, like, the biggest issue.

858
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,400
So, let me...

859
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,140
Let me make sure this...

860
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,300
This video is timed perfectly.

861
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:45,680
Okay.

862
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,300
Alright, here we go.

863
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,920
This should be it.

864
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,780
Alright, I hope this is correct.

865
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,240
I...

866
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,480
I hope...

867
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,820
I hope that I timed it correctly.

868
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,140
So, we're gonna see.

869
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,400
We're gonna...

870
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,460
We're gonna...

871
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,040
Alright, here we go.

872
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,440
You're gonna realize what this song is the moment we play it.

873
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,360
Well, you Baba had them forty thieves.

874
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,340
Shattered hides and a thousand tails.

875
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,300
But, Master, you win luck cause of your sleeves.

876
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,300
You got a brand of magic that never fails.

877
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,140
You got some power in your corner now.

878
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,060
Some heavy ammunition in your cap.

879
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,200
You got some punch, pizzazz, yaku and howl.

880
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,980
See how you got yours, rub, blab, laugh.

881
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,980
And I'll say, Mr. Aladdin, sir.

882
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,900
What will your pleasure be?

883
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,040
Gonna take your order, jolt it down.

884
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,960
You ain't never had a friend like me.

885
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,760
Life is your restaurant.

886
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,980
And I'm your maitre d'.

887
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,800
Come on, whisper what it is you want.

888
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,860
You ain't never had a friend like me.

889
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,120
Ha!

890
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,360
Proud ourselves on service.

891
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
You're the boss, the king, the shah.

892
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,420
Say what you wish.

893
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,640
It's yours, true dish.

894
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,400
Wub a little more black, la-bah.

895
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Have some of column A.

896
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,420
Try all of column B.

897
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,520
I'm in the mood to help you dig.

898
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,020
You ain't never had a friend like me.

899
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,340
Never had a friend like me.

900
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:15,620
Ha!

901
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,040
Ma-ha-ha!

902
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,280
Mo-na!

903
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,540
Na-ha-ha!

904
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,820
No, no.

905
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,080
Ma-ha-ha!

906
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,000
Na-ha!

907
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,480
Mm-ha-ha!

908
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,520
Can your friends do this?

909
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,920
Can your friends do that?

910
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,440
Do your friends pull this?

911
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,820
Of their little head?

912
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,460
Can your friends go poof?

913
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,560
Well, looky here.

914
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,960
Can your friends go abracadabra?

915
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,940
Let it rip!

916
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,440
And then make that sucker disappear!

917
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,920
So then, just sit there, slack-jawed, buddy-y-eyed.

918
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,680
I'm here to answer all your mid-day prayers.

919
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,080
You got me bona-fide, certified.

920
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,120
You got a genie for your shard affairs.

921
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,300
I got a powerful urge to help you out.

922
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,220
So what you wish you ever really want to know?

923
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,040
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt.

924
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,560
Well, I know I deserve like so and all.

925
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,760
Mr. Alonzo, have a wish or two or three.

926
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,660
I'm on the job, you big nub-bob.

927
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:17,660
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend, You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend, You ain't never...

928
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,100
Had a...

929
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,560
Friend...

930
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,760
Like...

931
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,160
Me!

932
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,880
Ha-ha!

933
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,600
Ha-ha-ha!

934
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,760
You ain't never had a friend like me.

935
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,280
Yes.

936
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,080
Uh...

937
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,020
Um...

938
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,520
That was also by shadd.

939
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,740
Ha-ha-ha!

940
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,260
Ha-ha-ha!

941
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,180
A huge shoutout to shadd for this amazing video edit.

942
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,500
Um, I gave him some of the ideas to do.

943
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,580
You know, I used to do this all by myself manually.

944
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,140
But then I was like, why am I doing this all by myself manually when I can like actually have like..

945
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,640
You know.

946
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,340
When it can just play automatically for me instead of me pressing all these buttons.

947
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,620
I'm so excited.

948
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,480
But yes, huge shout out.

949
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:23,120
For those who don't know, it's never a friend like me from Aladdin, the 1992 version with Robin Williams.

950
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:35,420
Because, I'm sorry Will Smith but, you can never live up to Robin Williams' version, the original Genie.

951
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,700
So this was the original Robin Williams version of Friend Like Me.

952
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,600
It's also one of my favorite songs as well.

953
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,940
Yes, I don't like the live action movie songs.

954
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,460
There's some of them that's actually pretty decent.

955
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,500
But then there's so... the majority of them is pretty fucking shit.

956
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,760
Anyway guys, we're still gonna stay in this venue chat.

957
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,540
So don't worry.

958
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,740
You don't have to move chat.

959
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,340
We're all still in this venue.

960
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,500
So...

961
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,900
So do not worry chat.

962
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,200
You don't have to move.

963
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,540
We're all gonna be here.

964
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:21,420
Anyway, let me grab... alright the next song.

965
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:27,600
I feel like you sort of know what the next song is by a few things that I'm gonna put up my screen real quick.

966
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,320
Let me get rid of Friend Like Me.

967
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,060
Whoa, we're underwater now.

968
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,260
We're gonna swim.

969
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,640
Oh my god, are those fishes?

970
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,960
Oh my god, there's fishes now.

971
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,640
I hope that... I hope that...

972
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,580
I mean... it's sadly gonna be unarchived because it was so scuffed in the beginning.

973
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,760
I was crashing non-stop.

974
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,940
I was crashing non-stop.

975
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,480
So sadly this is gonna be archived.

976
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,820
Guys, don't worry.

977
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,700
Dragoons can not breathe underwater.

978
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,220
But like, don't worry.

979
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,240
At least you get to watch this before you drown.

980
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,340
So...

981
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,040
Alright, so...

982
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,160
Are you guys ready for this song?

983
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,340
I'm gonna go in.

984
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,640
I didn't practice this song at all.

985
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,220
And to be fair, I'm gonna go in like...

986
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,760
I'm gonna go in from all the practice I've done as a little kid.

987
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,020
And I hope that...

988
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,680
I didn't practice this song at all recently.

989
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,900
And I'm just hoping that my fucking instinct is gonna kick in and remember this song.

990
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,100
Like...

991
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,480
But yes, has the volume been okay so far?

992
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,860
I hope it's not... instrumentals have not been too loud.

993
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,400
I hope the instrumentals have been okay and not too loud, chat.

994
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,500
Alright,

995
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:00,680
good.

996
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,520
Okay, here we go.

997
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,060
Yay!

998
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,660
Wait, before we start...

999
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,380
I need to... I need to hydrate.

1000
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,980
I realize I haven't been really hydrating.

1001
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,540
Hmm.

1002
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,580
Okay, let me hydrate real...

1003
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,780
Whoa!

1004
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:15,900
Whoops.

1005
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,080
At least that bottle of water was empty.

1006
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,140
Hydrate, guys!

1007
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,020
Alright, here we go.

1008
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,360
Here we go.

1009
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,040
Alright.

1010
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,520
I'm gonna hope that muscle memory kicks in here.

1011
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,280
I added this last minute because I was like, I love this song.

1012
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:49,160
We'll just do it like this for now.

1013
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,400
Okay.

1014
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,020
Here we go.

1015
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:53,140
Here we go.

1016
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:53,160
Yes!

1017
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,360
I love this song.

1018
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:53,780
Let's hear it.

1019
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,300
Oh, my God.

1020
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:55,500
Let's do it.

1021
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,700
I said no.

1022
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,720
Let's do it.

1023
00:51:59,720 --> 00:51:59,740
Let's do it.

1024
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,120
Let's do it.

1025
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,940
That's it.

1026
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,360
That's it.

1027
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,440
Take it from me!

1028
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,400
Guess who's coming on that plate?

1029
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,020
Uh oh!

1030
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,280
Under the sea!

1031
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,660
Under the sea!

1032
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,700
Nobody feed us, fry us and eat us in fricassee!

1033
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,000
We what the land folks loves to cook!

1034
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,220
Under the sea we off the hook!

1035
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,000
We got no troubles, life is the bubbles!

1036
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,140
Under the sea!

1037
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,480
Under the sea!

1038
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,900
Since life is sweet here, we got the beat here naturally!

1039
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,100
Even the surgeon and the ray, they get the urge to start to play!

1040
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,980
We got the spirit, you got to hear it!

1041
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,920
Under the sea!

1042
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,460
The newt play the flute, the carp play the harp, the place play the bass and they sounding sharp!

1043
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,600
The bass play the brass and the chub play the tub, the fluke is the duke of soul!

1044
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,040
The ray he can play the lings on the string, the trout rocking out the blackfish he sings!

1045
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,380
The smell and the sprite, they know where it's at!

1046
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,880
And oh that bluebird!

1047
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,320
The fish blow!

1048
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,640
I hope you're not drowning in water now dragons!

1049
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,360
Cause you can't breathe underwater!

1050
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,780
Yeah!

1051
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,000
Under the sea!

1052
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,360
Under the sea!

1053
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,120
When the sardine begin to peaking, this music to me!

1054
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,460
What do they say?

1055
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,420
A lot of sand!

1056
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,180
We got a hot Cretaceous!

1057
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,900
And each little clam here, know how to jam here!

1058
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,740
Under the sea!

1059
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,680
Each little slug here, cutting a rug here!

1060
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,600
Under the sea!

1061
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,380
Each little snail here, do you know how to wail here?

1062
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,720
That's why it's hotter under the water!

1063
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,260
Yeah we are lucky, down in the muck here!

1064
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,260
Under the sea!

1065
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:37,620
Woo!

1066
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,960
Huge shout out to Little Doki for uh...

1067
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,480
for fucking singing this song almost every day when she was a kid!

1068
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,100
Well not that!

1069
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,960
Huge shout out to Little Doki!

1070
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,100
I didn't practice this song at all!

1071
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,440
Um... today!

1072
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,720
So like, huge shout out to Little Doki for like...

1073
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,900

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,520
Cause I sang this song a lot!

1075
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,240
Hahaha!

1076
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:05,600
Hahaha!

1077
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:07,420
Hahaha!

1078
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,140
I was just like, oh my god!

1079
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,280
Okay I'm gonna sing this!

1080
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,980
I don't know how well I'm gonna do live!

1081
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,900
But like... it can't be that bad!

1082
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,680
Hahaha!

1083
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,000
Hahaha!

1084
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:18,780
Alright!

1085
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,680
Alright guys, we're gonna move venues!

1086
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,040
Uh...

1087
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,100
We're gonna move venues real quick!

1088
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,360
But we're not gonna go back to the main venue yet chat!

1089
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,500
So uh... give me a sec guys!

1090
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,920
We're gonna be moving to another venue!

1091
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,300
Everybody leave the ocean!

1092
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,920
Leave... leave the ocean chat!

1093
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,320
Leave!

1094
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,100
We're gonna swim back up now!

1095
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,340
Swim back up!

1096
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:39,960
Hahaha!

1097
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,100
Uh... dragoons!

1098
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,860
Swim back up!

1099
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,640
We need a...

1100
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,100
We need to go out of the ocean to another venue!

1101
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,060
Don't worry!

1102
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,340
Time to download myself!

1103
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,020
What do you mean by that?

1104
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,700
Well...

1105
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,140
Hahaha!

1106
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,020
I've download...

1107
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,620
DRAGOOONS!

1108
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,600
I've turned into a TV!

1109
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,820
Funniest shit ever!

1110
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,620
Hahaha!

1111
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:05,880
Hahaha!

1112
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,600
Oh my god!

1113
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,460
Funniest fucking shit ever guys!

1114
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,460
Hahaha!

1115
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:13,880
Hahaha!

1116
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,640
Alright...

1117
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,620
I'm gonna go straight in.

1118
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,680
I practiced this song like twice!

1119
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,360
Hahaha!

1120
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,620
I think this is the right one, right?

1121
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,160
Yeah, this is the right one!

1122
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,760
Hahaha!

1123
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:28,940
Hahaha!

1124
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,500
This was a triumph!

1125
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,720
I'm making a note here!

1126
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,100
Huge success!

1127
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:44,280
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction!

1128
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,160
Aperture Science!

1129
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,200
We do what we must because we can!

1130
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,740
For the good of all of us!

1131
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,480
I swear.

1132
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,300
I'm being so sincere... right now.

1133
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,140
I swear I'm not angry.

1134
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,520
But I got burned.

1135
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,520
Think of all the things we've learned.

1136
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,280
For the people who are still alive.

1137
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,860
Hey, there's people still alive, guys.

1138
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,300
Don't worry.

1139
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,780
Go ahead and leave me.

1140
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,020
I think I prefer to stay inside.

1141
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,680
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.

1142
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,480
Maybe Black Mesa.

1143
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:33,980
Ha!

1144
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,380
That was a joke.

1145
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,060
Ha ha!

1146
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,180
Fat chance.

1147
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,340
Anyway, this cake is great.

1148
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,240
It's so delicious and moist.

1149
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,380
Look at me still talking when there's science to do.

1150
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,360
When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not you.

1151
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,460
I have experiments to run.

1152
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,420
There is research to be done.

1153
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,320
On the people who are still alive.

1154
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,240
And believe me, I am still alive.

1155
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,300
I'm doing science and I'm still alive.

1156
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,300
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.

1157
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,180
While you're dying, I'll be still alive.

1158
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,300
And when you're dead, I will be still alive.

1159
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,400
Still alive.

1160
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,340
Still alive.

1161
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,120
Because I'm virtual.

1162
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,600
I don't know if you know that.

1163
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,260
Just so you guys know, I'm just, I'm virtual and that's why I'm still alive.

1164
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,440
Anyway, you don't get the cake.

1165
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,660
No, my immersion!

1166
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,280
Donkey!

1167
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm jamming out!

1168
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,280
No cake for you guys, sorry.

1169
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,700
Because I'm the one that's still alive.

1170
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,880
Alright guys, I'm gonna like, undownload myself from the TV now.

1171
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,620
And for those who don't know, that song was Still Alive from Portal.

1172
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:14,440
Um, uh, honestly, uh, I remember like listening to that song on repeat when I was like, a little, little dokey.

1173
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,620
So I was like, you know what?

1174
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,420
Let's do it.

1175
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,860
Also like, I wanted to sing this for a while too.

1176
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,300
But like, obviously like, Still Alive has like, a weird song.

1177
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,100
Like, when it comes to, when it comes to like, perms and stuff.

1178
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,140
So...

1179
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,840
Yes, I downloaded a cake into the TV, so it's now mine.

1180
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,120
So I'm glad I'm able to actually sing this song.

1181
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,440
It was a little scuffed.

1182
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,140
I mean, to be fair, this entire karaoke was a little scuffed.

1183
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,220
But it's not about how well I sing, it's about how good it looks.

1184
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,060
It's all about the visuals!

1185
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,140
It's all about the visuals!

1186
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,040
Not about how I sing!

1187
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,080
Just look at how pretty everything looks!

1188
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,140
As a...

1189
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,340
Alright, time to go back to the venue guys!

1190
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,100
Move along!

1191
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:03,980
Move along!

1192
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,220
Back to the concert hall!

1193
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,340
Back to the concert hall everybody!

1194
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,680
Alright, we're back here.

1195
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,300
I don't think I'm gonna update the list.

1196
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,000
I'm getting lazier.

1197
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:12,700
So we're gonna...

1198
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,540
I'm getting a little lazier, so I'm just gonna get rid of the list right now.

1199
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,960
Anyway guys, anyway.

1200
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,880
This one is a classic too.

1201
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,140
It's Christmas now.

1202
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,520
Oh my god!

1203
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,840
Do you know at this point with global warming, it might as well be...

1204
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,840
It might as well be like...

1205
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
It might as well...

1206
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,740
It might as well still be snowing.

1207
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,780
It might as well...

1208
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,580
Okay, let me...

1209
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,900
Let me see if I can pull this.

1210
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,920
I don't know if it's actually in KaraFund.

1211
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,180
So I'm gonna see if this is...

1212
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,940
I know I sang this before.

1213
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,720
So I'm like...

1214
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:52,940
Is this...

1215
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,280
Oh, it is!

1216
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,340
Wait.

1217
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,320
Is that...

1218
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:56,980
Is that the right one?

1219
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,760
Let me double check if this is the right one.

1220
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:03,380
Hey.

1221
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,320
Let me double check this.

1222
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,920
I need to make sure.

1223
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,780
This is one of my favorite.

1224
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:09,960
Okay, all of them are my favorites.

1225
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:10,300
Yeah!

1226
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,400
Okay, it is.

1227
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:11,780
Nice.

1228
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:12,920
I love this.

1229
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,040
Okay.

1230
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,300
Alright.

1231
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,600
Alright, you guys ready?

1232
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,360
Here we go.

1233
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,360
Oh, I spoiled it.

1234
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,650
I'm Mrs. White Christmas.

1235
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,430
I'm Mrs. Snow.

1236
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,630
I'm Mrs. Ice-cycle.

1237
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:36,810
I'm Mrs. Temblow.

1238
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,750
Friends call me Snow-Mizer.

1239
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,730
Whatever I touch...

1240
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,010
turns to snow in my clutch.

1241
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,970
Oh I'm too much...

1242
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,190
Oh, it's so cold.

1243
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:51,570
That's me!

1244
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:54,750
That's right!

1245
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,450
That's a weird guy.

1246
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:59,570
I said, but he's Mr. Timberlake.

1247
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:02,390
Friends call me Snow-Mizer.

1248
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,790
Whatever I touch, turns to snow in my clutch.

1249
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,290
Oh, I'm too much.

1250
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:15,470
I never want to know a day that's over 40 degrees.

1251
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:20,870
I'd rather have it 30, 20, then 5, then let it freeze.

1252
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:29,170
I'm Mrs. White Christmas.

1253
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:31,450
I'm Mrs. Snow, that's right.

1254
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,090
I'm Mrs. Icicle.

1255
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,290
I'm Mrs. Timberlake.

1256
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,110
Friends call me Snow-Mizer.

1257
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:43,530
Whatever I touch, turns to snow in my clutch.

1258
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,370
Too much.

1259
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,550
Too much.

1260
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,490
Oh my god.

1261
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,110
This song...

1262
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,350
Okay, I have a feeling.

1263
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:00,650
This is my favorite cover version of this song.

1264
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,270
And it's from like...

1265
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,010
It's like a female version of this.

1266
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,810
And like she's so good at...

1267
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:09,110
Like she sounds like Spinel from like that...

1268
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:09,590
The...

1269
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,510
That Steven Universe movie.

1270
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:12,730
She sounds just like her.

1271
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,430
And like she did like a female version cover of Snow-Mizer.

1272
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,450
And that song's been stuck in my head ever since.

1273
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,590
Huge shout out to her though.

1274
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,750
Because she is actually so fucking talented.

1275
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,950
And like she honestly like inspired...

1276
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,870
Like...

1277
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:31,130
Not inspired me, but like she actually like made me...

1278
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,810
Made me like really like this song in general.

1279
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:38,370
Because of the English cover of it.

1280
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,830
I think if you look up female cover...

1281
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,170
Snow-Mizer...

1282
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,170
You might be able to find it.

1283
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,530
Like it's sort of...

1284
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:46,250
It has like...

1285
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:47,990
Like I...

1286
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:52,010
I'm basically sort of emulating her voice when I sing this.

1287
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:52,310
Yeah.

1288
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,170
Like when you hear the cover you're like...

1289
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:59,270
Oh yeah, she's definitely trying to like emulate her voice.

1290
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:02,530
Yes, this is...

1291
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,750
This one was Snow-Mizer from something something...

1292
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,810
The Year of Santa Claus.

1293
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,630
The original version...

1294
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:11,630
I don't like it as much.

1295
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,290
To be fair.

1296
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:15,990
I don't really like Heat-Mizer's song.

1297
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,610
Heat-Mizer is like way too fucking slow for me.

1298
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:22,290
So but like Snow-Mizer is really good.

1299
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,070
Like I don't...

1300
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:23,590
I don't know.

1301
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,290
I never like thought much about the Snow-Mizer song.

1302
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:29,110
Until like I heard the female cover of it.

1303
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,110
And it was just so...

1304
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,250
Um...

1305
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,050
Um...

1306
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,050
That is like...

1307
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:35,970
That's why like it's...

1308
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,990
I like remember it so well.

1309
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:38,890
Um...

1310
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,750
Because like the female cover was just so good.

1311
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:41,830
Anyway...

1312
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:43,370
Snowy stopped.

1313
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,250
Everything melted.

1314
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:44,670
It's...

1315
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:47,550
No more snow.

1316
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:48,690
Everything's gone now.

1317
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:51,790
Snow has melted now for reals.

1318
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,130
Alright what's the next song?

1319
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,110
Snow-Mizer...

1320
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,350
Ba da da da ba...

1321
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:58,490
Ba ba da da ba...

1322
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,250
He is too much.

1323
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:01,150
Oh here we go.

1324
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,490
Okay.

1325
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:03,090
Uh...

1326
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:05,150
Let's see.

1327
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:05,710
Let me...

1328
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,910
Put on an outfit real fast.

1329
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:08,790
Alright.

1330
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,130
Boop.

1331
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,290
So I sort of like spoiled you guys a bit with this song.

1332
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,390
I spoiled it earlier.

1333
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:18,770
Um...

1334
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:21,010
And you see that put back a...

1335
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:22,130
Uh...

1336
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:22,790
Certain goggles.

1337
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:32,310
I put back like a certain goggles because there's a reason why.

1338
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:33,070
And you'll...

1339
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:34,150
You'll know why soon.

1340
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:38,870
We'll just go straight in.

1341
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,930
We're gonna go straight in.

1342
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:45,790
I should've used the app instead of the actual fucking web program.

1343
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,750
I think like that was the mistake I made.

1344
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:50,610
That was the mistake I made for all the crashes.

1345
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:56,870
Yeah.

1346
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:58,770
I might...

1347
01:06:58,770 --> 01:06:58,910
Okay.

1348
01:06:59,050 --> 01:06:59,390
Warning.

1349
01:06:59,530 --> 01:06:59,850
I'm gonna...

1350
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,750
I'm gonna fumble this a lot.

1351
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,730
I only practiced a little bit for this.

1352
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:04,410
But I really...

1353
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:04,790
I'm gonna try.

1354
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:05,470
I'm gonna try my best.

1355
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,790
This appear as a moral dilemma.

1356
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:09,950
Cause at first it was weird.

1357
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:11,970
That I swore to eliminate the worst of the plague.

1358
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:12,850
That devour humanity.

1359
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:13,530
It's true.

1360
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,510
I was vague on the house.

1361
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:17,350
So how can it be that you have shown me the light.

1362
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,350
It's a brand new day.

1363
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:20,590
It's a brand new day.

1364
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:26,150
And the sun is high, all the birds are singing that you're gonna die.

1365
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:32,370
How I hesitate, now I wonder why it's a brand new day.

1366
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,310
All the times that you beat me, I'll cut yourself, forgive.

1367
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,450
All the crimes that I've played, and it's honestly I'll live.

1368
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,430
Mr. Cool, Mr. Right, Mr. Know-it-all is through.

1369
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:45,510
Now my future is so bright, and I owe it all to you, who showed me the light.

1370
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:50,350
It's a brand new day, I got no remorse.

1371
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,070
Now the water's rising, but I know the course.

1372
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,490
I'm gonna shock the world, gonna show bad horse.

1373
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,290
It's a brand new day.

1374
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,190
And Penny will see me, the evil in me.

1375
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,410
Not a joke, not a dork, not a failure.

1376
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:15,310
And she may cry, but her tears will dry, when I hand her the keys to a shine.

1377
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:15,490
And she may cry, but her tears will dry, when I hand her the keys to a shine.

1378
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:16,510
It's a brand new Australia.

1379
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:22,210
It's a brand new day, yeah the sun is high.

1380
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:26,030
All the angels sing, because you're gonna die.

1381
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:30,270
Go ahead and laugh, yeah I'm a funny guy.

1382
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,130
So everyone goodbye.

1383
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,850
It's a brand new day.

1384
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:49,150
Yeah, it's also Dr. Horrible!

1385
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:57,770
So the reason why I have a city behind me is that like, um, it's called Brand New Day from, also from Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog.

1386
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:10,650
And then, um, the reason why I have a city behind me is that in the music video, he's in like, in his dreams, he turns like 50 feet tall, and he starts like fucking being Godzilla and like crushing all the city, the city around him.

1387
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,470
So that, this is me.

1388
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:15,370
Pretend I'm like, like 100 feet tall right now, stomping through the city.

1389
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,690
And like, pushing everything down.

1390
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,130
Just like the music video.

1391
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,440
Yeah, I'm like a kaiju right now.

1392
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,120
This is kaiju doki at the moment.

1393
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:29,340
Like,

1394
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,000
But, but that is like the ending of the fucking song.

1395
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,460
That's why, that's why there's a city behind me.

1396
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,780
If you're a Dr. Horrible sing-along blog fellow fan, you would...

1397
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,140
You would, you would recognize the, um, the reference.

1398
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,180
Majority of visuals are just like, you know, things that you can like, you recognize.

1399
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,020
You're like, oh my god, that was in the video, you know?

1400
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,800
You're like, oh my god, I know this, this was in the video.

1401
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:03,940
Okay.

1402
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,680
Um, the next song, let me hydrate real fast.

1403
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,640
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

1404
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,080
You can tell I haven't sang in a long time.

1405
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,140
That's cause I'm so bad.

1406
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:14,780
You can tell.

1407
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,460
Um, you can tell that, uh...

1408
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,680
I'm not very good at singing cause, uh, I'm compensating right now.

1409
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,380
Um, alright.

1410
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,800
I'm fumbling a lot.

1411
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:37,880
Cause I'm super nervous and like, when I was like crashing a lot, I like, the crashes actually, uh, fuck with my groove.

1412
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,420
It actually messed my groove up.

1413
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:43,980
Alright, anyway.

1414
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,120
Um, we're gonna move venue.

1415
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,360
Sorry I'm kicking you guys out again.

1416
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,740
Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna kick you guys out again.

1417
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,400
Uh, cause we're gonna be moving to a new venue.

1418
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,220
Uh, you might recognize this background.

1419
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,420
Uh, this place that I'm bringing you to.

1420
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,820
Uh, alright, give me a sec.

1421
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:06,200
Woo!

1422
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,200
Alright, you guys recognize that?

1423
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,140
Hahaha.

1424
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,540
Hahaha.

1425
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,900
Another venue change, chat.

1426
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,760
Another, um, another, another venue change.

1427
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,820
Uh, you guys might recognize this.

1428
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:25,740
Hahaha.

1429
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,540
Okay, I hope that I timed this okay.

1430
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:34,420
Like...

1431
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,560
Hahaha.

1432
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,140
Hahaha.

1433
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,060
Alright, let's try this.

1434
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,220
Okay, this is...

1435
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,240
Um, we all thought the other stuff was scuffed.

1436
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,280
This might be very scuffed.

1437
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,180
Okay, I just don't know if I can time this correctly.

1438
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:46,920
Okay.

1439
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,180
Welcome to the internet.

1440
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,600
Have a look around.

1441
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,540
Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found.

1442
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,860
Oh wait, you guys can't hear it!

1443
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:58,700
Already scuffed.

1444
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,320
Hahaha.

1445
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,860
I just realized you can't even hear it.

1446
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,040
Sorry.

1447
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:03,920
We'll try again soon.

1448
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,420
Round two.

1449
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:05,220
Hahaha.

1450
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,400
I almost acapella-ed it.

1451
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:07,920
Hahaha.

1452
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,580
Oh no.

1453
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,420
Oh no.

1454
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,680
Instrumentals are supposed to hide my flaws.

1455
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,540
Um.

1456
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:15,640
Hahaha.

1457
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:16,020
Hahaha.

1458
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,520
I realized last minute I almost acapella-ed.

1459
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,500
Alright, here we go.

1460
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,740
Welcome to the internet.

1461
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,340
Have a look around.

1462
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:28,280
Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found.

1463
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,360
We've got mountains of content.

1464
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,040
Some better, some worse.

1465
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,840
If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first.

1466
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,060
Welcome to the internet.

1467
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,760
Come and take a seat.

1468
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,600
Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?

1469
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,820
There's no need to panic.

1470
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,340
This isn't a test.

1471
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,840
Just nod or shake your head and we'll do the rest.

1472
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,180
Welcome to the internet.

1473
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,760
What would you prefer?

1474
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,880
Would you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur?

1475
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,060
Be happy!

1476
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,000
Be horny!

1477
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,820
Be bursting with rage!

1478
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,440
We've got a million different ways to engage.

1479
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,840
Welcome to the internet.

1480
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,420
Put your cares aside.

1481
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,420
Here's a tip for straining pasta.

1482
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,220
Here's a nine year old who died.

1483
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,680
We've got movies and doctors and fantasy sports.

1484
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:22,140
And a bunch of colored pencil drawings of all the different characters in like, I don't know, fucking each other.

1485
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,260
Welcome to the internet.

1486
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,860
Hold on to your socks.

1487
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:28,080
Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock.

1488
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,800
They are grainy and not pudding.

1489
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,120
He just sent you more.

1490
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:32,740
Don't act surprised.

1491
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,220
You know you like it, you whore.

1492
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,800
See a man beheaded.

1493
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:36,380
Get offended.

1494
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,120
See a string.

1495
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,700
Show us pictures of your children.

1496
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,040
Tell us every thought you think.

1497
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,400
Shout a rumor by a broom source and a deathly.

1498
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,120
Shout a rumor to a boomer.

1499
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,620
Or DM a girl and groomer.

1500
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,320
Do a zoom or find a tumor in you.

1501
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,740
Here's a healthy breakfast option.

1502
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,760
You should kill your mom.

1503
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,420
Here's why women never fuck you.

1504
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,700
Here's how you can build a bomb.

1505
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,480
Which Power Ranger are you?

1506
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,620
Take this quirky quiz.

1507
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:58,240
Obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids.

1508
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,920
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?

1509
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,780
A little bit of everything all of the time.

1510
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,800
Apopie is a tragedy and boredom is a crime.

1511
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,640
Anything and everything all of the time.

1512
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,500
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?

1513
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,400
A little bit of everything all of the time.

1514
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,500
Apopie is a tragedy and boredom is a crime.

1515
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,400
Anything and everything all of the time.

1516
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,120
I love Bo-Bram.

1517
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,180
You know...

1518
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,420
It wasn't always like this.

1519
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,160
I used to play Neopets.

1520
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,040
Very long ago.

1521
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,320
Just before your time.

1522
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,960
Right before the towers fell.

1523
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,260
Circa 99.

1524
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,340
This was catalogs.

1525
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,700
Travel blogs.

1526
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,080
Chat room or two.

1527
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,080
Set our sights.

1528
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,180
Spend our nights.

1529
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:06,620
Waiting.

1530
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,300
For you.

1531
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,580
Yeah, you!

1532
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,640
Unshakable you.

1533
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,700
Mommy let you use her iPad.

1534
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,080
You were barely two, man.

1535
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,980
It did all the things...

1536
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,200
we designed it to do.

1537
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,860
Look at you.

1538
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,800
Look at you.

1539
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:39,940
You.

1540
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,640
Unstoppable.

1541
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:46,660
Watchable.

1542
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,640
Your time is now.

1543
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,020
Your insides out.

1544
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,020
Honey.

1545
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,440
How you grew.

1546
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,360
And if we stick together.

1547
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,180
Who knows what we'll do.

1548
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,740
It was always the plan.

1549
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,800
To put that world in your hand.

1550
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,580
To put that world in your hand.

1551
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,280
To put that world in your hand.

1552
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:26,550
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?

1553
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,490
A bit of everything all of the time.

1554
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:49,350
A little pause... and we are back.

1555
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:01,970
Oh my god.

1556
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:07,270
I didn't realize how fast the beginning was.

1557
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:12,590
I forgot how fast the beginning was.

1558
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:13,070
I'm stumbling.

1559
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:15,750
My lips are stumbling.

1560
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:23,330
But yes, welcome to the internet.

1561
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,990
From Bo Burham.

1562
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:41,350
I've always hesitated to sing this song because Bo Burham was like, you know, the song was like, you know, very, very, you know, there's a lot in there in that song.

1563
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:44,690
But I was like, you know what?

1564
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,050
You know what?

1565
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:46,770
I'm going to sing it.

1566
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:47,650
I was like, fuck it.

1567
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,470
I'm going to fucking sing this song.

1568
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:50,530
I don't care anymore.

1569
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,130
I want to...

1570
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,970
I remember when it first came out, I was like, jeez, I had that song on.

1571
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,170
I was like, I'm going to fucking sing this song on repeat.

1572
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:02,390
And it was like, it was honestly, it's so good.

1573
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,170
It's such a really good song.

1574
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:09,070
Even though, even though like, you know, the lyrics in there is a little, whoa.

1575
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,030
The lyrics is like, whoa.

1576
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:18,550
But like, it's, you know, you can't deny it.

1577
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,430
It's a fucking earworm.

1578
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:22,910
Like it gets stuck in your head.

1579
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:25,950
And the parodies are also really, really, really fucking good.

1580
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,970
Anyway, I am kicking guys out of here.

1581
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:30,530
This is actually somebody's room that broke in.

1582
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:33,010
So I'm going to kick you guys out because we got to...

1583
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:36,150
We don't live here.

1584
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:38,170
We got to go back to the concert hall, guys.

1585
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:39,230
We got to go back.

1586
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:41,090
So back to the concert hall we go.

1587
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,390
You're back here again.

1588
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:49,510
I know it's a lot of work, like moving you guys back and forth a lot.

1589
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:50,810
But here we are again.

1590
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:51,930
Here we are.

1591
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,870
So this one, this one.

1592
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:57,570
This one.

1593
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,990
We're just going to like listen to...

1594
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,270
Honestly, it's just going to be like...

1595
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,610
You hear the backing vocals?

1596
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,890
Because I thought it was really funny when I sang the song.

1597
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,590
But there's no actual...

1598
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:11,430
There's no actual like...

1599
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,310
How do I say?

1600
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:14,670
There's no actual like karaoke of it.

1601
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,450
So we're just going to sing it because I thought it was really funny.

1602
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,710
I thought it was really good.

1603
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:26,870
So I was like, you know, we're going to sing it without the...

1604
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,050
What about the...

1605
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:29,310
There's no karaoke.

1606
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:32,390
So like I thought it would be a good time to sing this.

1607
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:33,430
Oh, okay.

1608
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:34,510
Sorry, you guys heard it.

1609
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,450
Like who...

1610
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:39,490
Let me see.

1611
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:42,170
I need to find the lyrics version so I know how to sing it.

1612
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:44,110
Okay.

1613
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:45,330
Here we go.

1614
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:52,450
Alright, so the reason why is because I thought the song really fits me really well.

1615
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:53,150
Hahaha.

1616
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:53,390
Hahaha.

1617
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:55,270
Hahaha.

1618
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:56,670
Hahaha.

1619
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:03,110
To be fair, this is like the most scuffed way.

1620
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,010
This is actually sort of like...

1621
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,850
The rest after that I haven't...

1622
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:09,030
The other songs after this I was just like...

1623
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,230
I'm not like prepared.

1624
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,310
There's no like sets for anything for it.

1625
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:12,870
But I just want...

1626
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:14,190
After this song...

1627
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:14,950
Actually no.

1628
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:18,890
After the Welcome to the Internet songs after that there's actually no...

1629
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:22,530
No like sets or props for the songs after that.

1630
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,130
But I just want to...

1631
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:23,410
But...

1632
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:26,190
So like you could take Welcome to the Internet as like the finale.

1633
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:27,690
But we're still going on.

1634
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:28,610
We're gonna still go on.

1635
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:29,010
Hahaha.

1636
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,090
Hahaha.

1637
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,470
Okay, let me double check this.

1638
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:41,970
Hahaha.

1639
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:43,930
Okay, okay.

1640
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:45,290
Alright, here we go.

1641
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:46,630
Alright, you guys ready?

1642
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:48,730
You guys ready chat?

1643
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:49,790
Alright, here we go.

1644
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:50,150
Hahaha.

1645
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:53,530
If I fumble at least like...

1646
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:57,030
You know, the actual singers will sing the song for me.

1647
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:57,970
Hahaha.

1648
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:58,610
Hahaha.

1649
01:20:58,690 --> 01:20:59,450
Hahaha.

1650
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:02,730
Okay, here we go.

1651
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:05,990
Hahaha.

1652
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:06,970
Hahaha.

1653
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,610
We're doing a sequel.

1654
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:12,190
We're back by popular demand.

1655
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,110
Come on everybody.

1656
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:16,890
Strike up a band.

1657
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,230
We're doing a sequel.

1658
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:19,770
That's what we're doing.

1659
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,110
V-tubing.

1660
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:25,890
And everybody knows the sequel's never quite as good.

1661
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,290
Hahaha.

1662
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,490
Friends, this is it.

1663
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:31,530
Do it all again.

1664
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:33,070
Hahaha.

1665
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,550
Until the credits roll.

1666
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:39,550
We got another goal to show that we can do it all again.

1667
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:41,290
Hahaha.

1668
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:42,790
Doing a sequel.

1669
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:45,450
There's no need to disguise.

1670
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,070
The studio considers us a viable group.

1671
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:49,550
Really?

1672
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,690
We're doing a sequel?

1673
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,510
The Dragoons once more.

1674
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:57,430
They wait for Tom Hanks to make Toy Story 4.

1675
01:21:58,010 --> 01:21:58,250
Wooo!

1676
01:21:58,630 --> 01:21:59,630
That's the end.

1677
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:00,710
But no my friends.

1678
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,450
This is when we do it all again.

1679
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,030
Do it all again.

1680
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,250
Hahaha.

1681
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,430
Let's give it a shot.

1682
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,610
Oh I mean now is a happy Simplot.

1683
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:14,510
Oh I mean now is a happy Simplot.

1684
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:16,590
Oh it's about getting the Muppets back together again.

1685
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:17,290
Oh my god.

1686
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:18,910
Getting Doki Bird back together.

1687
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,950
Oh my god.

1688
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,510
Her skin is four years old.

1689
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,450
But we're doing it.

1690
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,210
And they have to kiss each other.

1691
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:29,090
Huh?

1692
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,770
Kermit, how about the Muppets go on a world tour?

1693
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,890
Doki goes on a world tour?

1694
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:36,950
Hahaha.

1695
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,470
My friends, this is it.

1696
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,490
We get to do it all again.

1697
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:44,750
Hahaha.

1698
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:45,770
Until the credits roll.

1699
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:47,270
We got another goal to show that we can do it all again.

1700
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,610
We got another goal to show that we can do it all again.

1701
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:51,730
We got another goal to show that we can do it all again.

1702
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:53,050
The Doki World Tour.

1703
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,250
The Muppets again.

1704
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:57,170
It's the Doki again.

1705
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:01,270
It's the Doki.

1706
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,430
It's the Doki.

1707
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:03,290
It's the Doki.

1708
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:03,530
Again.

1709
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:04,390
Okay.

1710
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:06,130
It just stopped there.

1711
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:06,930
Hahaha.

1712
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:13,190
I really wanted to sing this song.

1713
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,530
Even though I had no karaoke.

1714
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,310
I really wanted to sing.

1715
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:17,510
Hahaha.

1716
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:20,470
Hahaha.

1717
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,790
It's an abrupt cut.

1718
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,730
I really wanted to sing it because I was like...

1719
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:26,570
This feels so me.

1720
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,730
The Doki World Tour.

1721
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:31,390
Hahaha.

1722
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:32,210
Hahaha.

1723
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:35,370
It actually just stops there.

1724
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,930
I was like, wait what?

1725
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:37,930
Hahaha.

1726
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:40,310
I was so surprised.

1727
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:41,410
I thought there would be more.

1728
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:43,610
But I guess this was the movie version.

1729
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,470
I got the movie version by the way.

1730
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:46,450
Hahaha.

1731
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:49,550
I was like, this must be the right video.

1732
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:50,510
I think.

1733
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:51,430
Because it's like...

1734
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,710
But there's actually a 4 minute video.

1735
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,910
But I was like, you know what?

1736
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:56,110
The short version is good enough.

1737
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,490
The short version is good enough for us.

1738
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:02,030
But we're doing a sequel from the Muppets.

1739
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:03,110
And I was like, oh my god.

1740
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:04,050
This relates to me.

1741
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,990
Hahaha.

1742
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:08,130
This relates to me so hard.

1743
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:09,870
So I was like, we're gonna...

1744
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,730
We're gonna do it all again guys.

1745
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:13,690
We're gonna do it all again.

1746
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:14,710
Alright.

1747
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,030
Let me pull up...

1748
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:20,090
I wrote some other songs that I wanted to do.

1749
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:21,690
Like as a bonus.

1750
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:22,630
For all you guys.

1751
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:23,970
But I need to find it.

1752
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:27,110
I need to find my list.

1753
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:27,990
Okay.

1754
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:30,250
Um...

1755
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,430
Okay, let's see.

1756
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,230
Let's see.

1757
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:36,270
Let's see.

1758
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:39,190
I have 3 bonus songs.

1759
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:41,470
I have 3 bonus songs for you guys.

1760
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,530
I don't have a set for this.

1761
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:45,550
But I'm willing to do it for you guys.

1762
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,210
Let's see.

1763
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:47,930
Ah...

1764
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,850
Alright, here we go.

1765
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,350
I've always liked this song.

1766
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,550
I mean, I love all the songs.

1767
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:54,290
Hahaha.

1768
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,570
I love all of them.

1769
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,490
That's the secret.

1770
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:02,690
I love all of them.

1771
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:04,030
Alright, here we go.

1772
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:06,170
Here we go.

1773
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:10,550
Nope.

1774
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:10,650
Nope.

1775
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,510
Good thing you guys didn't hear that.

1776
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:15,510
Alright, here we go.

1777
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:17,850
Hahaha.

1778
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:21,750
Alright.

1779
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,110
Okay.

1780
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,010
Guys, you ready?

1781
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:29,110
Alright.

1782
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:30,710
So...

1783
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,790
The only way to get what you want...

1784
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:34,170
Is to become...

1785
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,890
A human yourself.

1786
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,970
Hahaha.

1787
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:39,770
My dear...

1788
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,030
Sweet child.

1789
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,930
That's what I do.

1790
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:45,370
It's what I live for.

1791
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:48,510
To help unfortunate dragoons...

1792
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,170
Like yourself.

1793
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:51,750
Poor souls...

1794
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,170
With no one else to turn to.

1795
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:55,230
Hahaha.

1796
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,430
I admit that in the past...

1797
01:25:58,430 --> 01:25:59,450
I've been a nasty.

1798
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,850
They weren't kidding when they called me...

1799
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:02,470
Well, a witch.

1800
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,110
But you'll find that nowadays...

1801
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,630
I've mended all my ways.

1802
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,290
Repent to seeing the light and made a switch.

1803
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,990
True?

1804
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:10,830
Yes.

1805
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:14,970
But I fortunately know a little magic.

1806
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:18,030
It's a talent that I've always had possessed.

1807
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,690
And dear lady, please don't laugh.

1808
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:25,070
I use it on behalf of the miserable, lonely, and depressed.

1809
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:26,530
Pathetic.

1810
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:27,450
Hahaha.

1811
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,250
Poor unfortunate souls.

1812
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:32,050
In pain.

1813
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:33,690
In need.

1814
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:35,090
This one's long and hard.

1815
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:36,010
And wanting to be thinner.

1816
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:37,510
That one wants to get the girl.

1817
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:38,650
And do I help them?

1818
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:39,790
Yes indeed.

1819
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:42,930
Those poor unfortunate souls.

1820
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:44,470
So sad.

1821
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:45,870
So true.

1822
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:48,670
They come flocking to my cauldron crying...

1823
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,830
Spounds are so pleased.

1824
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:50,750
And I help them.

1825
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,230
Yes I do.

1826
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:54,970
It's happened once or twice.

1827
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:57,370
Someone couldn't pay the price.

1828
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,090
And I'm afraid I had to rake and cross the coals.

1829
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:04,190
Yes I've had the odd complaint.

1830
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,750
But I've been a saint.

1831
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:10,370
To those poor unfortunate souls.

1832
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,030
Hahaha.

1833
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:17,950
Have we got a deal, dragons?

1834
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:18,850
I've become human.

1835
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:21,530
I'll never be with my father and sisters again.

1836
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:24,990
But you'll have your doki.

1837
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:25,630
But you'll have your doki.

1838
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:25,990
Hahaha.

1839
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:29,990
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?

1840
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:30,390
Hahaha.

1841
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:32,770
Oh.

1842
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:34,970
And there is one more thing.

1843
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:35,950
Hmm.

1844
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:38,830
We haven't discussed the subject of...

1845
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:39,410
Payment.

1846
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:41,430
I'm not asking much.

1847
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:42,790
Just a token really.

1848
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:44,210
An akasupa.

1849
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,350
What I want from you is...

1850
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:47,710
Your voice.

1851
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:49,070
Hahaha.

1852
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,430
You'll have your looks.

1853
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:54,190
Your pretty beak.

1854
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:58,030
And don't underestimate the importance of...

1855
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:59,690
Body language.

1856
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:00,850
Hahaha.

1857
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,490
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber.

1858
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,070
They think a girl is pretty.

1859
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,250
But the one who gossips is a bore.

1860
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,490
Yes, some Latin is pretty preferred.

1861
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:10,150
For ladies not to say a word.

1862
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,410
And after all, dear, what is Ido Prado for?

1863
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:15,490
Come on, they're not that impressed with conversation.

1864
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:18,710
True gentlemen avoid it when they can.

1865
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:22,190
But they don't ensuin and fawn on a lady who's withdrawn.

1866
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:24,590
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man.

1867
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:28,130
Come on, you poor unfortunate soul.

1868
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:29,550
Go ahead.

1869
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:31,410
Make your choice.

1870
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:33,530
I'm a very busy woman.

1871
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:34,910
I haven't got all day.

1872
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:35,070
I'm a very busy woman.

1873
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,030
It won't cost much.

1874
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:37,310
Just your voice.

1875
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:39,950
You poor unfortunate soul.

1876
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:42,630
It's sad, but true.

1877
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:46,130
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet, you've got to pay the toll.

1878
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:49,010
Take a gulp and take a breath, and go ahead and sign the scroll.

1879
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,330
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got it, boys.

1880
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:53,290
The boss is on a roll.

1881
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:58,970
This poor unfortunate soul.

1882
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:02,290
Hahaha.

1883
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:10,530
Baluga saruga cum winds of the Caspian Seas.

1884
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:15,790
La rinse glas... dis is Latin I cannot say.

1885
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:17,090
La voce to me!

1886
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,530
Now superchat.

1887
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:27,450
Guess more!

1888
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:30,690
Keep superchatting!

1889
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:32,150
Yay!

1890
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:03,670
Thank you.

1891
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:12,150
That is the longest fucking outro.

1892
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:13,790
I forgot.

1893
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:15,730
I forgot.

1894
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:15,910
I forgot.

1895
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:19,430
Thank you for all the superchats everybody.

1896
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,970
Oh my god did I got Jesus Christ?

1897
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:25,210
Thank you Jesus for the superchat.

1898
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:25,810
Thank you.

1899
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:26,410
Thank you.

1900
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:35,350
I forgot how long the outro was for this fucking song.

1901
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:39,430
Oh my god.

1902
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:44,010
Alright do we end it with another... do we do another Disney song?

1903
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:45,010
You know I'll do an encore.

1904
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:48,390
Of a song we did before for the ending.

1905
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,750
But let me... let me do... let's see.

1906
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:53,650
We'll do this.

1907
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:56,150
Oh my gosh so that's what fell.

1908
01:30:56,330 --> 01:31:01,290
I was like what the fuck fell and it was my... it was my... it was my stream deck.

1909
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:05,190
Alright.

1910
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:07,050
Oh my god free superchat!

1911
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:09,170
David thank you for the akasupa!

1912
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:10,230
Thank you thank you!

1913
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:10,990
Alright.

1914
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:12,230
You know let me...

1915
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:14,310
Alright we'll do this one.

1916
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:15,610
I actually do have props for this.

1917
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:16,810
So give me a sec.

1918
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:17,730
Let me...

1919
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:21,030
Actually I don't.

1920
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,790
I don't know where it is.

1921
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:24,090
I didn't prepare this prop but because this is a bonus song.

1922
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:25,490
But this is another Disney song.

1923
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:27,630
I'll sing another Disney song for all you guys.

1924
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:32,810
And it will end it with a encore of a song I did before.

1925
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:36,710
I forgot to hydrate.

1926
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:44,350
You might recognize this because it's on my channel.

1927
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:50,170
It's also one of the easiest Disney songs out there so there's no way I can fuck it up right?

1928
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:54,790
Hello.

1929
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:01,310
Pa

1930
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,000
-pam -pa-dum pa-pam-pa-dum.

1931
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,720
Look for the fair necessities.

1932
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,920
The simple fair necessities.

1933
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:15,080
Forget about your worries and your strife.

1934
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:15,940
That's right.

1935
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,960
I mean the fair necessities.

1936
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:21,140
Old mother nature's recipes.

1937
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,420
That bring the fair necessities of life.

1938
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,980
Wherever I wonder.

1939
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,320
Wherever I roam.

1940
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,580
I couldn't be fonder.

1941
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,740
Of my big home.

1942
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:37,260
The bees are buzzing in the trees.

1943
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:39,500
To make some honey just for me.

1944
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,340
When you look under the rocks and plants.

1945
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,260
And take a glance at the fancy ants and me.

1946
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,580
Try a few.

1947
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:59,370
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

1948
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:01,650
They'll come to you.

1949
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,550
Look for the fair necessities.

1950
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,200
The simple fair necessities.

1951
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:11,050
Forget about your worries and your strife.

1952
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:11,690
That's right.

1953
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:14,190
I mean the fair necessities.

1954
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:14,430
That's right.

1955
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:14,930
The bare necessities.

1956
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:17,270
That's why a bear can rest at ease.

1957
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:20,390
With just the bare necessities of life.

1958
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:22,870
Now when you pick a paw paw.

1959
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:24,870
Or a prickly pear.

1960
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:27,570
And you prick a raw paw.

1961
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,410
Well next time.

1962
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:29,970
Beware.

1963
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:33,030
Don't pick that prickly pear by the paw.

1964
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:35,250
When you pick a pear try to use the claw.

1965
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,250
But you don't need to use the claw.

1966
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:40,590
When you pick a pair of the big paw paw.

1967
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:40,790
Uh huh.

1968
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:42,470
Have I given you a clue?

1969
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:45,490
Hmm?

1970
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:46,210
You understand?

1971
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,300
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

1972
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,580
Will come to you.

1973
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,460
Alright, pretend I have a trumpet solo.

1974
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,960
I have a trumpet right now.

1975
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,900
Oh wait, I know!

1976
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,420
My piano trumpet!

1977
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,020
Pretend my piano is playing the trumpet.

1978
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,100
Pew pew pew.

1979
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:15,920
It's like those electric pianos.

1980
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:19,520
Oh my god, now I'm doing margaritas on my electric piano!

1981
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,040
Woo!

1982
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,320
A piano!

1983
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:27,960
It's good!

1984
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,680
Yeah!

1985
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,060
Woo!

1986
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,440
Look at my fingers go on the piano!

1987
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:45,540
Ba da ba da ba ba ba ba ba boo!

1988
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,540
How does she do it?

1989
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,620
On the electric piano!

1990
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:53,960
Chucked it off.

1991
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,140
Ah man, that was really living.

1992
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:03,780
So just try and relax.

1993
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,040
Yeah.

1994
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,820
Cool it.

1995
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,600
Fall apart in my backyard.

1996
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:17,000
Cuz let me tell you something little britches, When you act like that bees act, Uh-uh-uh!

1997
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,180
You're working too hard!

1998
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:24,020
And don't spend your time looking around...

1999
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,980
For something you want.

2000
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,260
That can't be found.

2001
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:36,260
When you find out you can live without it and go along not thinking about it, I'll tell you something true.

2002
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:41,040
The bear necessities of life will come to you.

2003
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,360
They'll come to you.

2004
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:43,860
Yeah!

2005
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:51,800
Look for the bear necessities.

2006
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:54,160
The simple bear necessities.

2007
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,440
Forget about your worries and your strife.

2008
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,220
Damn right!

2009
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:01,080
I mean the bear necessities.

2010
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:03,580
That's why a bear can rest at ease.

2011
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:06,700
With just the bear necessities of life.

2012
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,420
With just the bear necessities of life.

2013
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,480
Yeah man!

2014
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:13,700
Woo!

2015
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:21,320
Did you know this is the easiest Disney song out there in the world?

2016
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:25,500
There's no way I could fuck it up.

2017
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,600
It's literally the one of the easiest Disney songs out there.

2018
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,500
Praise for bear necessities.

2019
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:34,460
Yeah!

2020
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,740
It's literally the easiest one.

2021
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:43,340
Out of all the Disney songs out there, if you look it up, the bear necessities is the easiest because it has like a very small vocal range.

2022
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:46,640
Like it's like the vocals for it is like super simple.

2023
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:48,800
And...

2024
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:52,680
And thank God because like I'm not like a gifted singer.

2025
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:53,480
Anyway!

2026
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,360
Last song chat.

2027
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,520
We made it to the...

2028
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:00,340
We're doing an encore of a song that I've done before.

2029
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:02,280
And I think you guys want me to do this again.

2030
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,320
I'm pretty sure.

2031
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:06,940
So...

2032
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:09,500
So we'll do the last...

2033
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,680
The very last song.

2034
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:11,880
Alright.

2035
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,160
I'm gonna make sure I time this correctly.

2036
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:15,900
Because like that is the worst part.

2037
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:16,620
It's just timing.

2038
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:20,060
Alright.

2039
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,500
Let me make sure I time this correctly.

2040
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:23,520
Alright.

2041
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,100
Alright.

2042
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:24,980
We're gonna move the venue.

2043
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,400
Guys, this is the last song.

2044
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,160
We're gonna do an encore of a song we've done before.

2045
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,120
But we're gonna move venues.

2046
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,920
You guys will... You guys love this place.

2047
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:33,680

Guys, OK.

2050
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:49,240
I feel like I have to reiterate about regarding this issue that we have.

2051
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:53,060
That has cursed this foking stream in the beginning.

2052
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:53,940
Um...

2053
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:54,620

Times have changed our kids are getting worse.

2066

They won't obey their parents.

2067
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:50,430
They just want to fight and curse Should we blame the government or blame society?

2068
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:53,910

2069

01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:10,110

Oh wait, this is acapella.

They're not even a real country anyway My son could've been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true But instead he burned up like a piggy on a BBQ

2081
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,780

2082
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,100

2083
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,100

The slut who was head the trash must match laughter and fun must all be undone must blame them that cause a fuss for someone things will blaming oooooooooooossss.

2088
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,940
Fucking Canada's fault.

2089
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:06,100
Of course Kanda ruined my encore.

2090
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,020
I did acapella.

2091
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,800
God fucking dammit Kanda.

2092
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:17,760
Kanda made me do an acapella.

2093
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:18,360
We're doing this again.

2094
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:23,940
I refuse to do this whole song in acapella.

2095
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,040
Encore of an encore.

2096
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,360
Fucking Kanda man.

2097
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:33,800
It's okay.

2098
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:36,780
Guys, this is gonna be unarchived by the way.

2099
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:37,840
This is way too scuffed.

2100
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,340
We're unarchiving this.

2101
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,300
Don't worry.

2102
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,120
Round 2.

2103
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:50,980
Another PTA meeting.

2104
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,720
Times have changed.

2105
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:55,220
Our kids are getting worse.

2106
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,920
They won't obey their parents.

2107
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,380
They just wanna fight and curse.

2108
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,040
Should we blame the government?

2109
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,000
Or blame society?

2110
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,960
Or should we blame...

2111
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,360
No, of course not.

2112
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:04,720
No!

2113
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:05,880
Blame Kanda.

2114
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,160
Blame Kanda.

2115
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:10,940
With all their beady little eyes and flapping heads so full of lies.

2116
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:11,860
Blame Kanda.

2117
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,360
Blame Kanda.

2118
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:16,380
In the form of a song it's Kanda's fault.

2119
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:17,160
They ruined my stream.

2120
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:18,800
Bro.

2121
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,500
They ruined my stream.

2122
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:23,400
Saw the entire cartoon and now he's off to join the clan.

2123
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:26,520
And my boy Dragon once had a picture on his shelf.

2124
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,720
But now I see him tells me to fuck myself.

2125
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,940
Blame Kanda.

2126
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,260
Blame Kanda.

2127
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,900
It seems that everything's gone wrong since Kanda came along.

2128
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:36,960
Blame Kanda.

2129
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,440
Blame Kanda.

2130
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:41,280
They're not even a real country anyway.

2131
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:45,400
My son could've been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true.

2132
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,320
Instead he'd burn up like a piggy on a barbecue.

2133
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,180
Should we blame the matches?

2134
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:51,660
Should we blame the fire?

2135
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,840
Or the doctors who will allow him to inspire?

2136
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,360
No!

2137
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,620
Blame Kanda!

2138
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,260
Blame Kanda!

2139
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,580
They ruined my stream!

2140
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:00,720
It's for karaoke!

2141
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:01,880
Blame Kanda!

2142
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:03,620
Blame Kanda!

2143
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:08,300
The smoke was cut, the trash was smashed, the laughter and fun must all be a done.

2144
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,960
We must blame them and cause a fuss before someone thinks of blaming us!

2145
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:17,480
Alright, I'm done.

2146
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,400
I'm done blaming Kanda.

2147
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,420
Sorry, this is like four times I sang this song.

2148
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,040
Like, I fucking feel it.

2149
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:22,780
Hahaha!

2150
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:24,860
Hahaha!

2151
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:28,860
God fucking dammit, Kanda!

2152
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:33,400
I sang this song four times.

2153
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:34,960
That's how pissed off I am.

2154
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,220
I can't believe I sang this acapella.

2155
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:48,500
I had to tell the world of how much Kanda has forsaken me.

2156
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:51,440
And my Canadian... fucking Canadian customs!

2157
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,720
And Canadian ISP!

2158
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:57,560
Hahaha!

2159
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:00,380
Fucking KANADA!

2160
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:01,960
Hahaha!

2161
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:03,500
Hahaha!

2162
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,620
Anyway, back to the concert hall.

2163
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:10,360
Hahaha!

2164
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,660
Where is my PC?

2165
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,020
Alright, Riverbob.

2166
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:15,800
Where is my PC?

2167
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,620
Alright, anyway.

2168
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,500
Um, I hope you guys enjoyed.

2169
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,480
Um, okay.

2170
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,380
Okay, okay guys.

2171
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:30,180
The reason why I don't want to archive this is because it was so fucking scuffed from the beginning.

2172
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:33,480
Um, when I could have just like honestly used the program...

2173
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,240
KaraFun program.

2174
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,120
Instead of like the...

2175
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,620
Um, instead of like the web version.

2176
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:41,160
And it was the web version that was causing all my crashes.

2177
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,220
And the moment I swapped...

2178
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:44,180
Um...

2179
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:45,420
The moment I...

2180
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,240
I swapped like...

2181
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:47,900
Uh...

2182
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,500
Hahaha!

2183
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:49,380
To...

2184
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,240
To like the...

2185
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,140
The actual...

2186
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:53,140
Um...

2187
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:53,780
The...

2188
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,640
The program...

2189
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:55,620
The program is stopped crashing.

2190
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:56,860
And I'm like, no!

2191
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,900
I wish I had done that in the beginning!

2192
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:00,420
Hahaha!

2193
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,440
Then we would have been scuffed!

2194
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,960
We would have been crashing!

2195
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:05,560
No!

2196
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:06,980
Hahaha!

2197
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,800
I'm a coward though!

2198
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,680
I'm a coward!

2199
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:14,300
Hahaha!

2200
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,720
And I'm a coward!

2201
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,320
Okay, guys.

2202
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:21,960
Okay.

2203
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:22,920
Okay, guys.

2204
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:23,500
Okay.

2205
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,100
Convince me to archive this.

2206
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:26,480
Okay.

2207
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,220
Alright.

2208
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:27,980
Hahaha!

2209
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,460
Thanks for scuff and mix it.

2210
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:31,760
Ah!

2211
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:32,680
I'm just embarrassed!

2212
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:33,860
I'm such a perfectionist!

2213
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:34,660
Because I worked so hard!

2214
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,720
I worked so hard planning all of this!

2215
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:37,860
So I was like...

2216
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:38,880
That's why I was like so sad!

2217
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:39,820
I planned...

2218
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:43,280
Like I worked so hard trying to plan all of this and doing all the assets and everything.

2219
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:46,340
So I was like so embarrassed when I started crashing.

2220
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:47,540
Hahaha!

2221
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:48,620
Hahaha!

2222
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:49,680
Hahaha!

2223
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:51,340
Ah!

2224
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:51,540
Ah!

2225
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:52,640
Ah!

2226
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,300
Are you guys sure?

2227
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:56,140
Are you guys sure I should archive this?

2228
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:57,900
Are you guys sure?

2229
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:58,820
Okay.

2230
01:44:59,040 --> 01:44:59,560
Okay.

2231
01:44:59,680 --> 01:44:59,980
Okay.

2232
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:00,260
Okay.

2233
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:00,700
I'll...

2234
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:01,460
I'll...

2235
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:02,420
For you guys, draggoons.

2236
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,100
I'm so embarrassed.

2237
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,280
But for you guys, I'll archive.

2238
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:06,440
I'll keep this archived.

2239
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,340
I'll keep it archived.

2240
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:07,940
I'm so embarrassed.

2241
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:08,500
Oh my god.

2242
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,160
I'm so embarrassed.

2243
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:09,900
Hahaha!

2244
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:11,920
Hahaha!

2245
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:13,460
Hahaha!

2246
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:15,220
Alright.

2247
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:17,120
Okay, everybody.

2248
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:18,180
Um...

2249
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:19,260
Thank you, everyone.

2250
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:19,880
I...

2251
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,340
I hope you guys enjoyed.

2252
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:23,320
I'll do an after party.

2253
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,280
But because I put it at 7.30, I didn't think I'd be like streaming longer.

2254
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,740
But like I'm gonna delay it a little.

2255
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:34,480
I'm gonna push the after party like maybe like 20 minutes more.

2256
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,460
So I can like chill a little bit.

2257
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:37,020
Hahaha!

2258
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,960
But like a huge shoutout to Shad for doing...

2259
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,000
Editing all of the...

2260
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,480
Editing all the...

2261
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,060
The videos for it.

2262
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,820
I definitely want my next karaoke.

2263
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:48,980
I want to make it like bigger and like more professional.

2264
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:49,600
Less...

2265
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:49,860
Less...

2266
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:50,440
Less scuffed.

2267
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,900
As this time, I want to do it less scuffed.

2268
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:53,600
Hahaha!

2269
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,160
I'll definitely be much more prepared.

2270
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,420
I feel like I definitely could have worked on this karaoke a lot more.

2271
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,680
I feel like I definitely could have worked on it a lot more.

2272
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:02,480
Um...

2273
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,360
And gave myself more time.

2274
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:06,040
But it was definitely harder to balance everything that was going on.

2275
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:08,060
And I definitely could have practiced the songs a lot more.

2276
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,000
Um...

2277
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,560
Um...

2278
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,480
But next time, I'll make sure it's even.

2279
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:13,340
Alright, guys.

2280
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,160
At...

2281
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:14,600
What?

2282
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:15,420
At...

2283
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:15,980
At...

2284
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:16,220
What?

2285
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:18,240
How many subscribers am I on right now?

2286
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,400
How many subscribers am I on?

2287
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:21,520
At...

2288
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,140
Uh...

2289
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:24,500
At 800k?

2290
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,140
At 800k subscribers will be my next karaoke.

2291
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,320
And...

2292
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:34,340
But that next karaoke will be bigger, better, more production value.

2293
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:36,300
And I would have practiced much more.

2294
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,120
Hahaha!

2295
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,740
I promise all you guys.

2296
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,900
I would practice a lot more.

2297
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:43,060
Um...

2298
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:44,600
For...

2299
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,120
It's...

2300
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:46,720
800k.

2301
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:47,840
Bigger production.

2302
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,700
A lot more practice.

2303
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:50,760
Less scuff.

2304
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,120
And we'll have a better PC at 800k.

2305
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,240
We get to 800k subscribers.

2306
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:55,460
Like...

2307
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,100
Huge production value.

2308
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,000
Hahaha!

2309
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:58,920
Hahaha!

2310
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:00,420
Hahaha!

2311
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:00,540
Hahaha!

2312
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:03,220
More production value than the trumpet piano?

2313
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,620
Bro, it's gonna be bigger and better than the fucking trumpet piano.

2314
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:08,840
I swear, guys.

2315
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:09,640
Hahaha!

2316
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:10,460
Hahaha!

2317
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,240
Hahaha!

2318
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:11,740
Hahaha!

2319
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,500
That's when you know it's more extreme than...

2320
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,120
Hahaha!

2321
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:19,220
No way!

2322
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,440
Um...

2323
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,340
But yes, I'm gonna call it...

2324
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:24,320
I'm gonna end the karaoke here.

2325
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,880
I'll raid the...

2326
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:29,560
I'm gonna push the after party waiting room to like 20 minutes.

2327
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,640
20 minutes to just chill a little bit.

2328
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,820
And reset myself.

2329
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,020
But thank you everybody for coming to my first karaoke!

2330
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:38,080
I'm sorry it's pretty scuffed and I was crashing in the beginning.

2331
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,460
I'm sorry for crashing a lot in the beginning.

2332
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:41,540
Hahaha!

2333
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:45,480
But it got better.

2334
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:46,380
Guys!

2335
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:47,740
It got...

2336
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:50,360
It stopped crashing at least!
