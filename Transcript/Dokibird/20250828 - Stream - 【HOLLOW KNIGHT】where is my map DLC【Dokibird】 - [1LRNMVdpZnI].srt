1
00:01:47,020 --> 00:02:14,680
hello everybody hello hello i'm sorry for being a little late i had to install something very very important um and i had to do something very very important very last minute because that's the joki way of course i would do the very important stuff 10 minutes before the stream starts um but this was incredibly important because i have some big news for everyone um So,

2
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:27,660
like, after my first stream, it was crazy because, like, Hollow Knight contacted me and was like, hey, do you want to try Silk Song early?

3
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,300
And I was like, oh, my God, I would love to try Silk Song early.

4
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,820
So I guess we're playing Silk Song.

5
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,540
now.

6
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:55,900
I can't believe it, guys.

7
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,140
Silk Song is real.

8
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,600
I can't believe it.

9
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,220
What?

10
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay, buddy.

11
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,460
What do you mean?

12
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
I'm Jane Silk Song.

13
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,760
Is this not Silk Song, guys?

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,020
It's not my Silk Song.

15
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,400
She looks a lot shorter.

16
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,240
What do you mean?

17
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,060
It's her.

18
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,980
Is this not her?

19
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:47,160
I say this is literally Jane Silk Song from the one so real I can't do it so okay I need you to know I could have had a different skin on okay it took two people to tell me not to do it because I they're like no don't do that you know what we could have been instead of silk song this was my first choice

20
00:03:52,120 --> 00:05:13,420
I had two people who were like don't do that but so anyway so what I learned was that you can apparently uh mod your mod your ignite to be anything you want there was I tweeted about it but until I don't know unless you guys make me a dokey a dokey night um a dokey night every part will be a different will be a different character it would have been based guys look I got silk song guys look at that whoa oh shit sorry silk sorry Jane um but basically every part will be a new character uh in my uh in my john holland night adventure until uh until maybe oh shit i keep and i'm not i'm not focusing at all until i don't know unless we get doki night then we'll just be doki night but for now i'm just gonna around with different custom skins uh you know what to do game mod dragon um so yeah guys look at that we're playing silk song guys a week early I mean,

22
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,320
He's like, what else?

23
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,280
Okay, maybe she isn't.

24
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,000
Look, look, Jane Silk-Song just haven't hit her puberty yet.

25
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,300
Okay, this is the prequel.

26
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,780
All right, Silk-Song was actually a prequel of Hollow Knight.

27
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,140
So she hasn't hit her growth spurt yet, guys.

28
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
All right, don't, no bully.

29
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,780
No bully.

30
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,280
She hasn't hit puberty yet, guys.

31
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,660
No, no.

32
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,360
It's just, it's exactly.

33
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,920
You're just, We're just having a flashback moment.

34
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,680
Yes, it's a pre-sequel.

35
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,840
It's a pre-sequel.

36
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,540
Look at that.

37
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,420

38
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,500

63
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,340
Like I said, this merch collab has been in the works for more than a year.

64
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,000
More than a year.

65
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,540
Like we were in talks since like during the summer, basically, or even earlier.

66
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,340
I don't even remember Gina how long we've been talking about this collection.

67
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,120
I know.

68
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,840
Like, we were, we've been talking about this, we've been working on this collection for a very long time.

69
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,460
Like, I've already lost track on how long it's been in the works.

70
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,140
But yeah, anyway, back to Silk Song.

71
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,660

All right, here we go.

78
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,020
Back to Hollow Song.

79
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,200
Silk night.

80
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,380
Hello, here I go.

81
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,140
Where am I?

82
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,780
Let me check my map.

83
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,680
Even when I'm Jane Silk's song, I'm still lost.

84
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,500
Kevlar would be like, oh my god, I can't believe she got content for 100.

85
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,460
I baited so many people.

86
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,340
What's this?

87
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,440
The Dash Master.

88
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,940
What do I get for?

89
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,400
Oh, it's the little heirloom thing.

90
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,240
Oh, it's a secret.

91
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,540
Hello.

92
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,060
Get out of here.

93
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:33,740
Wow.

94
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,260
Oh.

95
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,240
God, I hate these little mushroom guys.

96
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,700
Wait, that's it?

97
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,900
That's all I get?

98
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,300
What?

99
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,520
It's just murder?

100
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,060
There's nothing else?

101
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
All I get, I killed these...

102
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,080
I killed these mushrooms and all I get was murder?

103
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,240
All right, time to look at my map.

104
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,020
Where am I?

105
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, is it was there?

106
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,340
I did a home invasion and they have nothing for me?

107
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,020
What's the point of murdering at their own homes if they don't give me anything?

108
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,480
Murder is its own reward, don't you?

109
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,020
All right, maybe is there anything else?

110
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:56,620
all right she's not playing as hordes she's playing as wasp watch what i think of the super chat thank you thank you where do we go there's like this bug here and i want to kill him is that's not supposed to go here i murdered these people yeah they wasted my time i oh my god okay give me a sec all right there we go i can't believe they wasted my time home invading their home.

111
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,820
Wait, there was nothing there.

112
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,520
There was actually nothing there.

113
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,480
Their secret was pointless.

114
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,360
Yeah, I guess.

115
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,900
I guess maybe.

116
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,860
Apparently I played really well as, like, my first time playing this game.

117
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,800
And I mean, like, of course I'm a gamer.

118
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,100
Of course I do.

119
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,480
What did you expect?

120
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,980
I am a gamer.

121
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,640
after y'all

122
00:12:28,880 --> 00:13:51,240

123
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm Jane Silk Song.

124
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,980
That's right.

125
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,080
What happened to John Hollow Knight?

126
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,720
He's dead.

127
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,480
This is my game now.

128
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,320
We don't care about Hollow Knight no more.

129
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,240
It's Jane's turn.

130
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,720
We waited seven years for her.

131
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,820
This is her game now.

132
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,560
Alright.

133
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,340
No.

134
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,480
Oh, John all night.

135
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,700
My oh, she's.

136
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,680
He had us at time.

137
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,960
I played so well.

138
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,600
I unlocked Silk Song.

139
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,960
How do I open that door?

140
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Can we stop to get Silk Song?

141
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
No, we have Silk Song at home.

142
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,100
And I changed Silk Song.

143
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,220
Oh, shit.

144
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,180
I wasn't looking.

145
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,120
I...

146
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,620
Alright, time to give me a second.

147
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,240
I gotta use the souls of the children that I've killed to get my HP back.

148
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,080
Alright.

149
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,440
I don't know where to go.

150
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,100
Okay, so...

151
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,360
Can't do anything here.

152
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,760
Oh, I can open this.

153
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,840
Is that open the other door?

154
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,340
Alright.

155
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, I'm so excited!

156
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960
I released date!

157
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,240
I just continued Hollow Knight!

158
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,240
I...

159
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,140
I mean, like, oh, guys, guys, look, Suk San comes out.

160
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,000
Boots up all night.

161
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,200
Guys, look, I'm playing Suk San, guys.

162
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,100
Is this not what you wanted?

163
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,100
I could have, oh, yeah, there were, like, other, I was looking at all the mods and stuff that I could do, like, the skins and stuff.

164
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,960
And what did I get?

165
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,200
What is this?

166
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,740
The Mantis Claw.

167
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,640
Press A.

168
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,880
Oh, I can wall jump.

169
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,660
Nice.

170
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,900
I can wall jump now.

171
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,240
Yay!

172
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,240
Oh, that's cool.

173
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,320
I can Mario.

174
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:57,880
Nice.

175
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,340
Alright.

176
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,860
It's Mario time.

177
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, it's Mega Man time.

178
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:04,360
Whoops.

179
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,360
Okay, I'm...

180
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,220
You can tell I don't play platformers because I'm, like, trying to figure out how to...

181
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,540
Figure out the...

182
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,900
I'm trying my best!

183
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,640
I don't...

184
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,940
Okay.

185
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,120
Alright.

186
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,800
It's okay.

187
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,960
I'm figuring it out.

188
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,800
I've never played that, like, the Mega Man game or that Mario game.

192
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,120
Is there anything over here?

193
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,220
Oh my god, please.

194
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,280
Alright.

195
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,540
Is there anything here?

196
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,900
Oh, shit.

197
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,320
Okay.

198
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,940
Oh, no, this is bad for me.

199
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:13,980
Okay.

200
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,040
What even is over here?

201
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,640
What?

202
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Was it just a shortcut?

203
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,940
It's just more money, right?

204
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,780
They'll open the door.

205
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
Why do we even get out of that?

206
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,380
Anyway, it's just money?

207
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,100
Platforming.

208
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,480
My worst enemy.

209
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm so fucking bad at platforming.

210
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,360
It's literally just money.

211
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,280
That's really it.

212
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,560
No!

213
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,600
No!

214
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,300
God damn!

215
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,620
Okay!

216
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,600
Oh, thank God.

217
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,180
Speed run.

218
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,700
Speed run.

219
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,020
Okay.

220
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,820
I mean, there's nowhere else to go, right?

221
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,800
Okay, I just have to go up.

222
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,360
Alright.

223
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
It's this way.

224
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,220
There's a speed run tech.

225
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,760
I wanted to die there.

226
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,720
Now where am I?

227
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,020
Okay, I guess I'll never know.

228
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,980
Yeah, that's good.

229
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,520
Okay, it's good because I actually need any of these guys to heal.

230
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,620
Okay, nice.

231
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,540
3 HP.

232
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,860
So I consume the souls real quick.

233
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,720
Now where do I go?

234
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,250
Where do I go here?

235
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,270
I guess here?

236
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,630
God damn it.

237
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,170
I don't understand.

238
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,230
Why can't I just draw my shit here?

239
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,490
Okay, I can't Mario this yet.

240
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,430
Those wall jumps give me Game journalist from competitor

241
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,470
Look at least I can jump I know how to press a guys.

242
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,950
It's not that bad I still pressed a

243
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,490
God damn it.

244
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,590
No, no, no, no, no Back down here No

245
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:28,210
I still pressed a Oh my god!

246
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,210
I hate this!

247
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,750
I hate wall jumping!

248
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,010
Okay.

249
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,910
Oh my god!

250
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,490
Get me out of here!

251
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,370
Okay, we're fine.

252
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,330
Oh wait, I don't need an alternate wall?

253
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,730
Oh, okay, now I know.

254
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,710
I should be allowed to, like, fucking draw my map while I'm walking around.

255
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,790
Where the fuck am I?

256
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,530
Really?

257
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,910
No, there's no reason to be down here.

258
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,950
Oh, it opened a hole in the village?

259
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,030
Oh, I didn't even know that.

260
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,210
Okay.

261
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,730
Yeah, they gave it a super chat.

262
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,070
Thank you.

263
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,970
Thank you.

264
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,810
I thought it was just a shortcut.

265
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:10,790
Wee.

266
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,850
I thought I just got a shortcut, guys.

267
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,370
Just looked like a shortcut.

268
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,550
Wait, how did they come back?

269
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,830
Oh, oh my god.

270
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,450
Is it that giant hole in the middle?

271
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,150
Is that... Yeah!

272
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,410
I'm this the biggest fucking hole in my life?

273
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,610
I wonder where that hole could be, guys.

274
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,570
Hmm.

275
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,890
Where could it be?

276
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,410
It could possibly be that giant hole, right?

277
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,990
No, that's way too obvious.

278
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,870
If it's a hidden village, they want to hide it, right?

279
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,910
All I'm saying is if it was a hidden village, they would have worked harder in hiding it.

280
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,350
Oh my god.

281
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,630
Oh my god.

282
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,530
Okay, I can heal here.

283
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,730
This is my safe spot.

284
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,570
Alright, here we go.

285
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,910
Alright, there we go.

286
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:06,450
Nice.

287
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,590
See?

288
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,170
Yeah.

289
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,210
It would not be the most obvious hole.

290
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,430
Oh my god, it is easier.

291
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,930
If I just do it like that.

292
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,270
Okay, now that's the shortcut.

293
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,750
I told- What?

294
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,930
Knock, knock.

295
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,050
Knock, knock!

296
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,070

297
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,590

301
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,310
Okay, that door is closed.

302
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,090
This door just gets deeper and deeper.

303
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,620
We can both be Jains.

304
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,680
This is what happened to John Hollow Knight.

305
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:38,840
That's why John Hollow... John Hollow Knight isn't allowed to show up anymore because um because jane got a restraining order on him they're my kids too exactly what

I'm so confused.

310
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,660
Okay.

311
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,460
I don't even know where I came from.

312
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,580
Down?

313
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,280
I came from down.

314
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,420
I can't open this door.

315
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,540
Nor can I do this.

316
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,460
This door is locked too.

317
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,220
Oh, a place I tried to enter before.

318
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:40,730

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,710

The shitty one?

322
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,190
This shitty area is where I have to go next?

323
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,130
Oh, no.

324
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,570
That's about my last life.

325
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,570
I gotta farm some citizens.

326
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,790
Some children.

327
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:01,650
Oh.

328
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,090

I'll go up here and then see if I can farm some stuff.

332
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,690
We gotta farm some children.

333
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:16,930
There you go.

334
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,350
That's one.

335
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,530
That's not a child, but I'll take it.

336
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,930
I'll take what I can get.

337
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,290
You know what?

338
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,050
I should buy some stuff, honestly.

339
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,630
Am I close to anything?

340
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,710
Oh, I am not close to anything.

341
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,030
Where the fuck is the Stag Beetle here?

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,270
Oh, this is bad.

343
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,550
I am not close to anything.

344
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:53,230
all right it's not a child i would know if it's a child because i'm used to absorbing the souls of these children oh

347
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,340
I am the child leader.

348
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,600
I know if somebody is not giving me children.

349
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,040
It's sustained me.

350
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,720
You can't scam me out of my children.

351
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,140
Wait, am I?

352
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,600
Oh, wait.

353
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,540
That's not...

354
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,820
I thought that was like...

355
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,460
I thought that was like a column that he couldn't get me.

356
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,780
Like, huh, what you gonna do now, sir?

357
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,300
Okay.

Yeah, unlock this, too.

359
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,680
Oh, this looks like a boss fight.

360
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,860
Oh, yeah.

361
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,220
Give me a sec, guys.

362
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,160
I'll come back soon.

363
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,240
I don't want to lose my mud.

364
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,660
I do not know where there's any...

365
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,800
I need to find a bench.

366
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,560
Give me a sec.

367
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,080
Alright.

368
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,940
Guys, I have a thousand six hundred dollars.

369
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm not losing my money

370
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,400
All right Bravely ran away.

371
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,400
Where is the bench?

372
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,520
Where is the closest bench?

373
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,580
I don't know.

374
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,220
They do not look very friendly.

375
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:52,180
They look Uh There's like a bunch of them and then there's a bunch of like Bug carcasses.

376
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,320
They do not look friendly whatsoever Okay Maybe better at the parkour stuff, though.

377
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,460
Where can I go?

378
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,660
I mean, the closest...

379
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,000
Bench is like, yeah.

380
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,320
Wait, Quora, what are you doing here?

381
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,580
You've been watching me struggle this entire time?

382
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,020
Hello again.

383
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,380
I suppose you're already met with the tribe of this village.

384
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,040
Hmm.

385
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,580
They seem a little distrustful of strangers.

386
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,980
dangers.

387
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,420
Put it.

388
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,700
They are not brids, though.

389
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,360
No, the sickness in the air that clouds the mind of lesser beasts.

390
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,240
They resist it.

391
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,820
They retain their intellect and their honor.

392
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,140
Though also their lethal traditions.

393
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,360
I have some words of advice, my friend.

394
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,220
You plan to challenge the lords of this tribe.

395
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,780
Your blunted nail may prove inadequate.

396
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,780
There is a city nearby.

397
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,780
The old capital of Holownest.

398
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,880
I've heard a nail smith recite, sir.

399
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,960
Seek the old bug out, and we find progress that much easier.

400
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,020
Okay, but where is that?

401
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,120
Can you mark that on my map, sir?

402
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,100
Like, oh, shit.

403
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,880
Wait, are you still there?

404
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,980
Sir, here's my map.

405
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,780
Can you mark that?

406
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,900
Can you mark that on my map?

407
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,520
Here, I have a quill.

408
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
Here, here, here's my map.

409
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,780
Put it, where, where is it?

410
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,580
Where, dude.

411
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,560
I'm just asking him to put a dot on where the fuck that is.

412
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,380
Where, He just says, go find it.

413
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Please!

414
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,520
Where's my GPS?

415
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,980
Where is the closest direction?

416
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,280
Alright.

417
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,340
I'll sell him in trouble.

418
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,140
I'll mark it on your map.

419
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,240
Alright, we gotta go down.

420
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,520
I'm gonna go down so I can get to that bench.

421
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,780
Is there not, like, a closer...

422
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,640
Like, me...

423
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,760
At least I can, like, save.

424
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,940
save my map too.

425
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,880
Okay, there's the Mantis Village.

426
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,680
Should I go all the way back to the...

427
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,780
I mean, I could go back to the Queen Station.

428
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,920
I could go all the way back.

429
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,360
Yeah, it's not that far.

430
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
I'll just go all the way back.

431
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,900
Because I want to...

432
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,400
I want to spend my money.

433
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,340
I have money anyway.

434
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,300
Might as well spend it.

435
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,860
Take a shot every time Joki jumps into the acid wild yapping.

436
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,300
I mean, it doesn't hurt.

437
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:49,180

438
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,760
it should technically be easier hey guys so All right, we'll go this way.

439
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,080
Yeah, it's a lot easier with this.

440
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,820
Okay.

441
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,740
Get over here.

442
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,760
Why did you fly up?

443
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,240
All right, and then we go this way.

444
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,080
All right, let's just ignore them.

445
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,180
We'll just speedrun it.

446
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,660
Boop.

447
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,340
Boop.

448
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,960
You don't matter.

449
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,520
Okay.

450
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,100
Okay, and then we go up.

451
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,080
And then we go...

452
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,680
Oh, shit.

453
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,460
I forgot about these stupid fucking mind shit.

454
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,520
Oh, my God.

455
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,780
It's fine.

456
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,100
We're fine.

457
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,600
We're okay.

458
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,380
Okay, and then we go left and then up.

459
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,280
See, we're making progress.

460
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,860
I mean, we're making negative progress, but progress is progress, guys.

461
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,800
It's still considered progress.

462
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,520
It may be negative, but it is progress.

463
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,840
Progress.

464
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,820
Reverse progress.

465
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,480
Okay.

466
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,000
And this is this way.

467
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,900
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

468
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,100
Oh shit, I wasn't supposed to go up.

469
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,900
Alright, go back down.

470
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,320
It was actually this way.

471
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,960
Oh wait, did I open this?

472
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,620

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,160
Alright.

474
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,920
And then we go.

475
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:31,520

Whoops.

I would like to go to Dirtmouth, please.

486
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,940
I have a lot of money to spend.

487
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,000
With money, you can exchange for goods and services.

488
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,320
Oh, wait, that's not what I want.

489
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,060
Stop being me.

490
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,460
Never!

491
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,000
You should stop trying overcharging his stupid fucking maps.

492
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,120
Alright, nice.

493
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,860
Alright, what do I buy?

494
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,220
Simple ill-fit, which is usually like to poke around places you don't belong.

495
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,700
Life in...

496
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,740
Okay, we need...

497
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,920

I am Zolta Mighty, a knight of great renown, man.

502
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,540
Tremble before me.

503
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:45,000
While you're hiding there in your dingy little village, I venture into the dark pit below us and slew a great beast.

504
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,800
It had sharp mandibles and atrocious manners.

505
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,060
Yes, yes, all glory to me, but I don't have time for adulations.

506
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,060
I must rest and prepare for my next journey down.

507
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,560
Get out of my head.

508
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,480
Wait, who's he?

509
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,900

Alright.

512
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,000
We gotta figure out.

513
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,060
What can I...

514
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,880
What can I farm?

515
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,100
I need to figure out where I can farm.

516
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,240
Oh, is this the arena?

517
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,600
I feel like I'm gonna die.

518
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,240
This feels very arena-like.

519
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:49,580
Oh, no.

520
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,200
It's the temple of the black egg.

521
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,640
Do not blink the bug.

522
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,620

It's like a full fucking freaking nurse bug.

534
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,580
Does no one remember it?

535
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,860
I gotta claim my paycheck.

536
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,280
What are those paychecks called?

537
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,280
Where like, if you take care of a...

538
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,660
If you take care of a...

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:30,320

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,220
Oh, hey.

542
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,100
And this.

543
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,180
What the fuck is that?

544
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,440
Oh, it's a piece of the mask.

545
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,360
It's really fucked up.

546
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,600
Have you guys ever read about it?

547
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:50,880
Where, like, there's some parents that take a bunch of...

548
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,720
Is this stipend?

549
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:59,200
There are some parents that take a bunch of children from foster care just to get paid by the government, but they, like, treat the kids really poorly.

550
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,420
It's so fucked up.

551
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,920
That's basically what I'm doing with the bugs.

552
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,380
I'm doing with the caterpillars.

553
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,380
I'm here to collect my government check.

554
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,980
I did it.

555
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,020
Toki.

556
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,740
Yeah, it's pretty fucked up, right?

557
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,560
Anyway, I gotta collect my government check.

558
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,460
I... Oh my God.

559
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,500
It's bleeding.

560
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,840
That sucks out early access.

561
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,480
Free the crumbs.

562
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,160
I did not say that's what you wouldn't say.

563
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,820
Oh, shit.

564
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,360
Okay, there's a big bug over here that I can find.

565
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,160
You have...

566
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,220
Oh, it's a hot...

567
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,760
No, I don't care if I have enough.

568
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,040
I gotta kill this guy just for the sake of it.

569
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,580
No, I'm just killing him.

570
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,080
Oh.

571
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:04,980
All right.

572
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,020
I have enough.

573
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,580
I'm killing you just for fun.

574
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,800
There we go.

575
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,860
For the love of the game.

576
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,100
I didn't even need to kill you.

577
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,760
That one was just for fun.

578
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,120
Guys, if I find more grubs, I get paid more by the government.

579
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,080
They don't need to go to school.

580
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,160
They'll just, we need, they just need to take care of, they need to go find jobs and take care of each other.

581
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,340
I am a good parent.

582
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,940
I am foster carrying them.

583
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,960
Alright, I can buy the lamb.

584
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,300
Ascend.

585
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,380
Alright.

586
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,040
Lamb time.

587
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:57,880
Yay!

588
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,060
Where's the mini confession sad?

589
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,140
Sad when you need it.

590
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,560
Or thank you for the super chat.

591
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,020
Thank you.

592
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,760
Thank you.

593
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,680
Wait.

594
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,400
What?

595
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:07,740
How?

596
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,140
Is it?

597
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,260
automatically equipped?

598
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,420
Can't tell.

599
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,180
Do I have it automatically equipped?

600
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,600
Because it's like a...

601
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,540
Oh, okay.

602
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,260
It is.

603
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,420
Alright.

604
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,420
Go down, I'll go.

605
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,640
Okay, now I can go to Queen Station.

606
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Don't worry.

607
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,160
As long as I confess my sins, I shall be forgiven.

608
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,340
Alright, just in case.

609
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,380
If I die heading there.

610
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,180
Up I go.

611
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,160
Oh shit.

612
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,020
It's supposed to be this way.

613
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,940
God damn it.

614
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,180
Okay.

615
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,620
I missed the wall there.

616
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,190
Alright.

617
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,630
Next boss is the real skill.

618
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,490
Check don't worry.

619
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,990
I was born to game.

620
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,810
I think this way.

621
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,010
This is the faster way.

622
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,370
Is it?

623
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:20,090
all right let me double check my map okay here and then we go this way

624
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:30,470
no down here okay yeah it's down here is it down here yeah it is

625
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,390
then we go this way and then we get the shortcut

626
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:45,430
yay Born in the 360 nose, go.

627
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,690
Alright, and then...

628
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,510
Oh, wait, I can just go from this side.

629
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,630
I could get the bench, though, just in case I die.

630
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,410
Yeah, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna grab the bench just in case.

631
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,390
I feel like that's gonna happen to me.

632
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,290
Honestly.

633
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,870
Yeah, I mean, like, I'm already getting shit on by this stupid fucking mantis.

634
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,230
Wow, yeah, God sucks on really.

635
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,930
It's crazy.

636
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:17,850
Okay.

637
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,790
Well, I now figure out the pattern for this.

638
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,150
Go down from here?

639
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,830
Oh, it's this way.

640
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,100
Alright, and then we go down.

641
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,200
Oh, wait.

642
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,880
Oh, I keep forgetting you can parry.

643
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,420
I keep forgetting that's a feature here.

644
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,460
But I feel like I'm still gonna fuck it up anyway.

645
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,620
Because the timing for parry is...

646
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,360
Seems like really tight.

647
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,460
If you don't know, like, the...

648
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,180
If you personally don't know the timing of it.

649
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,000
And I definitely don't know the timing.

650
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,200
Yay, Pogo!

651
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,260
Alright.

652
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,740
Well, you got this bench.

653
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,660
Alright, time for the Mantis.

654
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,840
How do I get there?

655
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,480
Give me a sec.

656
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,760
I'll check my GPS.

657
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,380
Syria, where is the Mantis?

658
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,000
Okay.

659
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,720
All right.

660
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,840
I gotta absorb the souls real quick.

661
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,700
God damn it.

662
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,760
These are so annoying.

663
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,840
Oh my gosh.

664
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,780
Why didn't that POGO?

665
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,600
I do need a farm in these, though.

666
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:45,940
Parry?

667
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,480
Okay, parry.

668
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,820
Oh, shit.

669
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,580
Fucked with me, I guess.

670
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,580
Where is...

671
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,760
Oh, it's one...

672
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,600
One area higher.

673
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,480
Alright.

674
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,880
Wait, actually, I need that.

675
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,860
Oh, shit.

676
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,380
Never mind.

677
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,460
I accidentally used the magic.

678
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,060
I wanted to, like, upgrade my souls to max before I go.

679
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,240
God damn!

680
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,200
Okay.

681
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,200
Stupid acid trip.

682
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,940
Alright.

683
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,240
All right, now I go down the hole.

684
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,860
Oh, God, I was so close.

685
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,020
I was like, it's fine.

686
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,200
And I forgot.

687
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:48,280
And I wanted to farm this a little.

688
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,320
This way, and then we go down.

689
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,920
All right, we go this way.

690
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:24,040

Alright, we gotta go this way.

697

The mantis lord.

698
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,130
I was not ready for that.

699
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,630
Holy shit.

700
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,570
That's the new filter.

701
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,270
That was is definitely the new filter.

702
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:35,130
Not the fucking Jane Silk sign.

703
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,690
There has to...

704
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,330
Is there no closer bench?

705
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,630
Like, do I have to do that?

706
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:44,150
Oh, hey.

707
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,290
Nice.

708
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:52,270
Wait, where the fuck did he come from?

709
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:58,070
I feel like there should be a closer bench.

710
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:27,950
you beat them oh my god stupid monopoly on benches there you go all right i think that the hardest part is just the fact that it's so far i hate how far it is all right can i maybe not challenge you

711
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,310
These, sir, I just need one bench.

712
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,530
It's not fair.

713
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,930
Why can't I have the bench?

714
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:42,590
Okay.

715
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,330
Just wanted to...

716
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:46,750
Okay.

717
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,270
Okay, that's...

718
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:52,430
Alright.

719
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,610
Okay, there's that.

720
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,310
Okay, there's that again.

721
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,910
Okay.

722
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,060
Alright.

723
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,520
Okay.

724
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,940
Alright, this is wait.

725
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,720
Oh, fuck!

726
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,760
Okay, that was just me being greedy.

727
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,440
Let's see.

728
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,740
I'm making literally...

729
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,360
Alright, yeah.

730
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,120
Okay, I understand.

731
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,480
I understand now.

732
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,780
Alright.

733
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:36,690
Alright.

734
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,830
I understand.

735
00:47:43,270 --> 00:48:02,910
his pattern is like pretty easy yeah unless he has like a second fucking phase then like then i don't understand you know if he gets into another phase then i i stop understanding but for now i me understand

736
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:16,380
actually i'll try to when he does that fuck okay never mind fuck He doesn't let me charge you up for that.

737
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,340
Oh shit, there's two!

738
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,700
Oh fuck!

739
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,840
I'm glad you know we'd be cool!

740
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,420
Guys, we're not cool, apparently.

741
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,100
We're not cool.

742
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,140
Jesus Christ, okay, that's bullshit.

743
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,300
I don't even know when I can heal, honestly.

744
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,220
Like, what?

745
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,760
Oh, can I bounce off that?

746
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,880
Oh, I can!

747
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,060
Okay.

748
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,200
I get it.

749
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,740
I get it.

750
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,440
I can bounce off of it.

751
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,640
Okay.

752
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,240
That makes sense.

753
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,620
Oh my gosh.

754
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:00,900
Okay, yeah.

755
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,640
Okay, that's a lot.

756
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,900
Okay, I ran into him.

757
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,960
Okay, I understand that.

758
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,840
Okay, this is easy.

759
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,480
I was like, wait, I can't avoid this.

760
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:12,980
All right.

761
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,520
I figured it out.

762
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,800
I downloaded the pattern.

763
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:25,920
I've downloaded you Okay, that's good that I can I thought I couldn't bounce on it That's what I was like What the fuck

764
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:38,120
I just don't know when I can heal It feels The acid got me again

765
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:48,730
I think the hardest part was just literally Figuring out when I I can heal, because I don't know yet.

766
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,950
When there's two of them, I feel like I can't heal.

767
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:54,770
I'm not sure.

768
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,850
Timmy seems, like, incredibly tight.

769
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:02,730
I guess if I had the... I think if I had the...

770
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,250
What was it?

771
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:13,170
That charm where I can heal with the armor, I have to use the armor charm or some shit.

772
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,700
Oh, shit.

773
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,020
Okay, that's...

No.

782
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,720
Can't heal that.

783
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,380
Oh my god, I can't heal that either.

784
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,880
I'm trying to figure out when I can heal.

785
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,260
I'm going to stall this a little bit so I can, like, heal.

786
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,960
That won't be full HP.

787
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,340
Oh my god, you fucking whore!

788
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,660

Why are you like this?

793
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,960
Okay.

794
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:34,670

795
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,870

797
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,370
Fuck you then!

798
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:47,930
I don't need a heal.

799
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,150
No heals for you.

800
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,770
He's so mean.

801
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,870
Such a mean person.

802
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,290
That's why nobody like- No, that's why nobody came to your birthday party.

803
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:06,870
Fuck you.

804
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,350
This is the only time- Okay, this is actually the only time I can heal.

805
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,370

That should have been, like, that should have been it, but I got angry.

808
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,890
I let my anger get the best of me.

809
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:56,950
Oh, I could have swapped my charms.

810
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:57,290
It's alright.

811
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:57,870
We're committing.

812
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,820
It's okay.

813
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,200
We're committing it to it.

814
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:08,980
Alright.

815
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,400
That's why nobody came to that guy's birthday party.

816
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,800
Everybody hated him.

817
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,500
Good.

818
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,580
It's fine.

819
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,140
He's actually pretty easy.

820
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,040
Um, but like, I got really cocky and then angry.

821
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:30,500
Alright.

822
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,860
I'm ready for real.

823
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,160
Like his patterns are pretty simple.

824
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,600
But anger spoke to me today.

825
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,080
Okay.

826
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,540
Okay.

827
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:55,590
Alright.

828
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,050
I hit him, I think.

829
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:02,270
Yay!

830
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,710
Oh, I want to poof him.

831
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:05,610
Whoa!

832
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:07,110
Hippie!

833
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,010
Alright, hit.

834
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:13,550
Whoa!

835
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,670
That's right!

836
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:15,890
Can't catch me!

837
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,610
So I'm the gingerbread man!

838
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:21,490
Nice.

839
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,430
Use the magic tier.

840
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:24,770
Wait, did I hit him?

841
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:25,310
I can't tell.

842
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,870
I actually can't tell if I hit him there.

843
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:28,670
Oh, shit!

844
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:29,410
What?

845
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,250
Oh, you bitch!

846
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:32,690
I got

847
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,440

848
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,260
He's not playing fair!

849
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:41,900
Ref!

850
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,160
I demand the referee.

851
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,820
Sorry.

852
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,940
He ain't fairly fair, sir!

853
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:01,970
There we go.

854
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:41,110
I can only use it once though which sucks this one is like scary ah the two oh my gosh when it's two it's like a lot scary because they combo like what I have to stay in the center yeah I have to stay in the center then he's gonna do that oh my Okay, that was down.

855
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,980
Ref, I caught a foul.

856
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,600
Oh, yeah, all right.

857
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,760
Let's get rid of this.

858
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,040
We don't need this.

859
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,620
Oh, I don't think we need swarm if we're going to be here.

860
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,480
I think I need this so I can heal.

861
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,920
Wait, oh, I can't do that.

862
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,460
Maybe those will move around us.

863
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,600
Oh, wait, I can dash up and down.

864
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,680
Would that be good?

865
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,740
I feel like that would be good actually I'll do that

866
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:29,860
Wait what Okay Is that But I thought I said I can dash up

867
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:47,510
Oh I can dash more And that does it actually No you don't understand I need the compass You don't...

868
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,230
You don't...

869
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,850
You don't understand.

870
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,470
I need that compass.

871
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,730
Used by Shaman Draw More Souls from...

872
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,790
I feel like I do need that, actually.

873
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:04,350
Okay, fine.

874
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,450
I'll take that so I can get the...

875
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,570
I'll take that, because we need that.

876
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,210
Do I need Dash Master?

877
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:14,830
I don't know.

878
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,690
I feel like I don't really need the Dash.

879
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:17,430
But we'll try.

880
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,730
Okay.

881
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,090
Are you serious?

882
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,210
Oh, fucking horror.

883
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,030
Alright.

884
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:34,430
Nice.

885
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:40,750
Oh, no.

886
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,130
Okay, the dash save me.

887
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,070
Oh my god.

888
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,170
Yes, we need the dash.

889
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:44,730
Never mind.

890
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:45,510
Dash is good.

891
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,510
That dash actually saved my ass.

892
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:53,750
Alright.

893
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:54,490
Nice.

894
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,570
Nice.

895
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:59,030
If I didn't have that dash, I could have died.

896
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,990
I almost died there.

897
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,590
I actually could have died there.

898
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,330
I saw a life dash before me.

899
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,050
Okay.

900
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,150
That's a...

901
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,870
Oh, shit.

902
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:17,650
God damn it.

903
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,130
Accidentally fucked up.

904
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,130
And used the magic.

905
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:24,670
Alright.

906
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:28,870
Nice.

907
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,130
I sort of...

908
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:34,110
I need the...

909
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,750
Actually, no, I don't need full of magic.

910
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:36,830
Or full of solos.

911
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,010
It's when it's 2 that it gets so complicated.

912
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,480
Oh, fuck!

913
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,320
I didn't mean to dash.

914
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,180
Oh my god, that was actually...

915
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,100
That was an accident.

916
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,200
Ah, no!

917
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:00,960
This is my bad!

918
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,700
Bad run!

919
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:13,810
Okay.

920
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:20,920
Are you serious?

921
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,340
Okay, yeah, this is a bad run.

922
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,580
Oh my god.

923
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,980
Guys, I'm not okay.

924
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,840
I'm not okay.

925
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:34,940
Okay.

926
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,300
Alright, nice.

927
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,200
Alright.

928
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:50,450
Ooh.

01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:21,480

931
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,800
This is actually so fucked up.

932
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,070
This is so fucked up.

933
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,030
No, shit!

934
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,350
I just don't get hit.

935
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,650
I don't know if I like...

936
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,210
I feel like I...

937
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,950
I feel like I don't dash as much.

938
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,770
I'm going to take the dash off and just get the heals.

939
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,710
Yeah, I don't think I...

940
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:09,550
dash that much in general to acquire it.

941
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:12,630
So I'm going to use the I'm going to use the focus.

942
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:21,130
The focus so I can heal during the phases.

943
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:23,670
Yeah.

944
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,800
Alright, six times the charm.

945
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:38,240
No, I fucked up during first phase because I wasn't paying I wasn't paying attention.

946
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,420
I wasn't locked in.

947
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:40,700
Alright.

948
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,400
I understand the pattern.

949
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,820
I just wasn't locked in there.

950
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:49,580
Yes.

951
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,150
Alright, we got full.

952
01:02:59,070 --> 01:02:59,430
Alright.

953
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:07,810
Here we go.

954
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:08,990
This is it.

955
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:12,190
I wish they have an HP bar so I know when to heal sometimes.

956
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,350
So I don't accidentally.

957
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:19,410
That's right.

958
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:20,510
God damn it!

959
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:20,850
Fuck!

960
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:21,750
I was distracted.

961
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:24,350
I actually...

962
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,440
I actually trolled there.

963
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,390
Oh, it's just TK trolling.

964
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,110
Are you serious?

965
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,360
What?

966
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,180
Okay.

967
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,080
What is your fucking hitbox, little man?

968
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,720
Sorry, big man.

969
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,020
Hitbox is dumb.

970
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:52,460
Are you...

971
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,600
Okay, I'm missing my magic.

972
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,160
Ooh, now.

973
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,040
Alright, sorry.

974
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,860
Doki, don't be angry.

975
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,360
Stop being angry.

976
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,220
Your anger is fucking you over right now.

977
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,180
Be calm.

978
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,140
Meditate.

979
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:11,610
Okay.

980
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,710
I'm just rushing it too much, I think.

981
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:15,670
I think I'm just rushing it.

982
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,760
Okay.

983
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,140
I'm trying to charge it up so I can...

984
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:27,580
Okay.

985
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:31,640
Alright.

986
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,000
Inner peace.

987
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,000
Just gotta find inner peace.

988
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:39,780
Nice.

989
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,420
Okay, nice.

990
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,680
All that I need is inner peace.

991
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:53,700
Alright.

992
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,840
Oh my god, that's so bullshit.

993
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,550
Okay, I'm locked in.

994
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:04,390
Oh, oh.

995
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:07,390
Okay.

996
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,600
Oh.

997
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:19,290
Oh.

998
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:19,810
Oh.

999
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:20,950
Oh.

1000
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:22,370
Nice.

1001
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,630
I got greedy with the magic.

1002
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,090
I got so greedy with the magic.

1003
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:38,970
Alright.

1004
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:39,630
Nice.

1005
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,070
Go, dokey do.

1006
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,610
Inner peace.

1007
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:45,990
Don't let them win.

1008
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:48,070
If you get rage-fated, they win.

1009
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,830
Just don't get rage-fated.

1010
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,010
That's what they want.

1011
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:56,930
Don't let the monkeys win.

1012
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,970
Don't let the Superman monkeys win.

1013
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,170
Oh my god, I've missed that.

1014
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:12,210
I don't know how.

1015
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,260
EH!

1016
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,120
Hey!

1017
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,380
Don't let them rage me.

1018
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,440
Okay, one down.

1019
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,680
Nice.

1020
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,800
Heal, just in case.

1021
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,640
This is the run.

1022
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:35,980
Nice.

1023
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:36,520
Yay!

1024
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:43,160
Okay, not gonna lie, they're actually very easy, but I kept getting rage baited.

1025
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,260
Because their patterns are so easy.

1026
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,060
I just fumble because I angry.

1027
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,200
I angry.

1028
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,480
I got angry and greedy.

1029
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,580
I don't think they're that hard, not gonna lie.

1030
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,780
Bro fell for the rage bait.

1031
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,540
Has to be a bench nearby, right?

1032
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,940
There's a secret here?

1033
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,180
Who's that?

1034
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,400
This gives me the cringe.

1035
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,180
Wishes little teachers.

1036
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,040
We're still all over the place in the past, isn't it?

1037
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,480
Shire a dark, twisting maze.

1038
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,340
Unless you're well prepared, I urge you to leave.

1039
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,200
Go to give you the song, you know.

1040
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,800
Would you like to buy my map?

1041
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,080
Oh, now it's $38.

1042
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,920
I guess the map bubble finally burst.

1043
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,820
Thank fucking God.

1044
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,860
Thank God the map bubble economy has burst, guys.

1045
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:54,880
I'm so happy.

1046
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,360
He doesn't deserve my money.

1047
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:00,440
Yeah.

1048
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,140
Uh...

1049
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,180
Do I have to go?

1050
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:07,540
What is this?

1051
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,020
Oh, it's just money.

1052
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,400
Oh, shit.

1053
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,600
Sorry, I didn't know where to go.

1054
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,720
You're so mean.

1055
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,480
He doesn't deserve my money.

1056
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,860
I thought you guys said there was a bench here.

1057
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,100
Bench where?

1058
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,560
Guys, you said there was a bench here.

1059
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,410
It's back in the village?!

1060
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,170
Oh my god, I'm leaving this village.

1061
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:50,310
Alright, I'm going back, I'm leaving.

1062
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,470
I'm going back to the village.

1063
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,330
No benches.

1064
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,660
Oh, there you go.

1065
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,720
What is, how do I get that mask?

1066
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,480
Alright, this way.

1067
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,580
Hello guys.

1068
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:16,300
Hey.

1069
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,120
Oh, do they respect me now?

1070
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,900
They're bowing to me!

1071
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,280
That's right.

1072
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,880
I'm James Silkson.

1073
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,080
They respect my authority.

1074
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,540
Oh my god, look, they're bowing to me!

1075
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,080
Can I kill one of them?

1076
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:32,720
Oh.

1077
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,220
I'll acquire your soul.

1078
01:09:40,500 --> 01:10:09,880
I okay I thought they would be like I don't know I thought they let me kill them bow before your queen I'm hungry feed your queen if I kill enough of them will they still be friendly to me you're so evil I require a sustenance who let's themselves be killed.

1079
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,640
I'm called followers for one.

1080
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,340
Daka, thank you for the super chat.

1081
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:18,620
Thank you.

1082
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:19,100
Thank you.

1083
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,260
Fun fact, Converse White makes him charge for his maps.

1084
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,360
He'll happily give it to you for free otherwise.

1085
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,600
So stop being mean.

1086
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,580
Oh, so, oh wait, there's the bend.

1087
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,340
Oh, so the wife is the gold digger.

1088
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,040
Okay.

1089
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:34,700
That makes okay, now I understand how he's with her.

1090
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:41,700
I don't think...

1091
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,700
I don't need the shell anymore, so I'm gonna grab this.

1092
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,240
Such slander.

1093
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:02,730
Nice, what's that?

1094
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,370
Mark of the Pride.

1095
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:06,230
What's that?

1096
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,520
Oh, wait, wait, that's good.

1097
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,880
How much is it?

1098
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,720
How much does it require?

1099
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,300
Three!

1100
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,340
I don't have enough.

1101
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,480
I have to get rid of these.

1102
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,640
I don't need the souls, though.

1103
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,380
Okay, when I have more fucking slots, I'll use it.

1104
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,500
I don't have more slots.

1105
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:37,860
Alright, nice.

1106
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,400
What's this?

1107
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,340
Hollow Nest Seal.

1108
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,480
What?

1109
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,020
Where is that?

1110
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:54,860
Where the fuck is that?

1111
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:56,780
Oh, there it is.

1112
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,120
Okay.

1113
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,040
I can buy more slots?

1114
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,040
How do I buy slots?

1115
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,620
Oh, money!

1116
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,620
That's right.

1117
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,100
I'm your king now.

1118
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,220
Your treasury is mine.

1119
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh, I can sell it?

1120
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:19,820
Oh, nice.

1121
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,400
Alright, we'll sell it later.

1122
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,220
Alright, where do we go now?

1123
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,400
Uh, alright, so I killed it.

1124
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:27,420
Did...

1125
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,740
So I guess I completed this area?

1126
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,340
We go to the deep nest, right?

1127
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,020
Alright, let's check the map.

1128
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,180
Alright, there's the green path.

1129
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,600
Do we do the deep nest next?

1130
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,200
Where do we... What's the next area?

1131
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,140
I have to explore.

1132
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,120
Go Queen Station?

1133
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,440
I can go to the city?

1134
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:55,600
Where's the city?

1135
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,930
The big statue?

1136
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:09,730
Is that the city of tears?

1137
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:13,430
Wow.

1138
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:17,730
Where is the city of tears?

1139
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:20,970
Where the fuck is that?

1140
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,230
Is it to the right?

1141
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:42,270
I'm just like I like my little guys just like where the fuck is city of where the fuck is city of tears put in fungo ways okay oh from here okay all

1142
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:56,400

1143
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,100
Alright.

1144
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,480
Go this way.

1145
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,740
And then to the left.

1146
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,760
That's right, respect me.

1147
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:18,100
I killed your fucking kings and queens, I guess.

1148
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,180
That's right.

1149
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,920
It was me, a dokeybird.

1150
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,320
It was me, Barry!

1151
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,820
Okay, this way.

1152
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,460
Okay, why don't the exploding mushrooms respect me?

1153
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:41,270
They are alive, but they hold no respect now.

1154
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:42,070
Ow, fuck.

1155
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,790
Are they truly alive and nobody respects them anymore?

1156
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:52,250
They might as well be dead.

1157
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,030
Alright, this way.

1158
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,860
Okay, okay, it's to the right.

1159
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,700
So it's this way.

1160
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,120
Oh, I can do this now.

1161
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,940
now.

1162
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:20,740
Okay.

1163
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,200
Now that I have the moth... What the fuck?

1164
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:23,420
Oh!

1165
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,380
Alright, anyway, as I was saying, now that I have... God damn it, not again.

1166
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,100
Okay.

1167
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:37,000
Now that I have the moth thing, I can do this now, guys.

1168
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:37,720
Alright.

1169
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,680
Honestly, thank you for the raise.

1170
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,780
Thank you.

1171
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,500
Because I can do this now that I have...

1172
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,040
Yay, speedrun!

1173
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:50,320
Yeah,

1174
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:54,320
intentional!

1175
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,180
It's just a speedrun tech, guys.

1176
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,900
Oh my god, I hate parkour so much.

1177
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,000
If I could just do only the boss battle and I give my controller to someone else to do all the parkour parts.

1178
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,060
I did it on purpose, guys.

1179
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,320
A large knight statue.

1180
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:23,640
socket on his chest insert the city crest sure into the when there's a hole there's a goal

1181
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,860
oh he's sleeping

1182
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:46,520
hello knock now oh shit okay not friendly not guys i think they were not friendly

1183
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,060
Alright, nice.

1184
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:53,760
I'll just...

1185
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,620
Oh hey, there's a little knight there.

1186
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,540
Go up?

1187
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,540
Oh my god, I don't have a map for this area.

1188
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:07,780
I gotta wait for fucking Cornelius to sell me this goddamn map again.

1189
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,140
Is he blind?

1190
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,000
Oh shit, no, he's not blind.

1191
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:15,000
Okay.

1192
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:17,800
Nice.

1193
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:18,980
Alright, alright.

1194
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,740
At least he gave me some souls to divide.

1195
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,520
Where is the exploding man?

1196
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,180
There he is.

1197
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:29,780
All right.

1198
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,700
I have one fear.

1199
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,580
And it's those who don't fear for their own lives.

1200
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:42,760
Because if I have zero natural survival instincts, I fear someone who has negative survival instincts.

1201
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,860
Exploding is just it.

1202
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,100
It's just a way of saying hello.

1203
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:49,000
Hello.

1204
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,520
It's just a way of getting close to me because it's more intimate when they're...

1205
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,020
When their intestines are out in me, right?

1206
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,780
It's so much more intimate when their insides are out all over me.

1207
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,480
That's when you know they're real friends.

1208
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,060
Get a friend that'll just explode on you.

1209
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,600
That's a real one.

1210
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,100
Because they can only do it once.

1211
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,740
Wait, can I...

1212
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,320
Oh, I thought I could go out.

1213
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:28,940
Go down.

1214
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,200
Go down?

1215
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:32,800
Oh.

1216
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,180
What the fuck was that then?

1217
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,200
Wait, what was the other thing?

1218
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,660
The great gates have been sealed.

1219
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,740
None shall enter.

1220
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:44,940
None shall leave.

1221
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:51,800
Oh, these guys are like those cities that close off and stuff and doesn't want it.

1222
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,760
It's like Wakanda!

1223
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:53,620
It's Wakanda!

1224
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:57,160
They don't want to interact with nobody.

1225
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,160
It's Wakanda.

1226
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,060
I'm bored here, Richard.

1227
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:12,730
Yeah, none shall enter.

1228
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:16,330
Hello there.

1229
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:18,210
I want to talk?

1230
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:23,030
The capital lies below us, my friend.

1231
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,090
What a somber priest, it seems.

1232
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:43,550
And one that holds the answer to many a mystery i too have felt the pull of this place though now i sit before it i find myself hesitant to descend is it fear i wonder or something else that holds me back how did he get into bakonda bakonda forever

1233
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:53,030
and now thank you for the super chat thank you thank you what can we say don't We see it here when we just need to explode.

1234
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:58,150
Oh, shit.

1235
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:00,030
Okay, I did not expect him to hit back.

1236
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:05,170
Can't believe he would hit back like that.

1237
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:10,650
Oh.

1238
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:12,310
Nice.

1239
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:13,650
It's over there.

1240
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:14,430
Open up.

1241
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,030
Give me your money.

1242
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,730
Oh, he was guiding his life savings.

1243
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:20,270
That's why your kid's not going to college today.

1244
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:22,890
Okay.

1245
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:24,090
What's this?

1246
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:25,290
Oh my god, they can fly?

1247
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:26,870
Oh shit.

1248
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:32,710
Alright, nice.

1249
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,650
I don't know why I'm here though.

1250
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:40,680
Ow.

1251
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,700
That is so rude, sir.

1252
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,860
Yeah, they fly now?

1253
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,120
I know I'm going...

1254
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,480
Okay, it's in Metrovania, so there's no such thing as, like, a right and wrong way.

1255
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:53,620
Oh, it's just parkour.

1256
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,220
Goink, mine now.

1257
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,400
Okay.

1258
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,680
Hello, come back.

1259
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:03,160
Come back.

1260
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,180
I need your soul and your money.

1261
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,180
I need your college fund.

1262
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,880
Because I have an addiction to maps.

1263
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,550
Okay, obviously, like, this is the right path.

1264
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:22,790
So, that's right.

1265
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:23,490
I'm a pillager.

1266
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:30,550
Downstairs.

1267
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:31,470
Oh, it's a stag.

1268
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,350
Sack Station is here.

1269
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:35,730
Right?

1270
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:39,690
Wait, what does this map say?

1271
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,130
What is this?

1272
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:44,470
I can't read, but conda.

1273
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:50,350
Oh, it wasn't a station.

1274
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:51,550
What the fuck is that?

1275
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,810
What's over here?

1276
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,790
Wait, what did I open?

1277
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:06,990
I have to go down.

1278
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:07,710
Okay, give me a sec.

1279
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:08,630
Let me kill him first.

1280
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:15,610
to make sure he's... I gotta make sure his bloodline is gone before I go anywhere.

1281
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:20,590
It's the most important part of any video game.

1282
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:26,170
All right, I want to check what this is.

1283
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:28,150
Wait, I'm still going up?

1284
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:29,930
Holy shit.

1285
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:31,190
Oh wait, I hear a child!

1286
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,130
I hear my stipend!

1287
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,050
It's like somewhere here!

1288
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:38,210
Oh, it's not here.

1289
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:41,410
Now I definitely don't know where I am.

1290
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:43,190
I...

1291
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:44,030
Okay.

1292
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:45,470
All right, we go down.

1293
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:52,990
Or Sipin?

1294
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,610
Don't keep me king.

1295
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:56,190
They're king.

1296
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:58,510
Maybe it's here.

1297
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:00,830
Okay, no.

1298
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,510
I can still go up.

1299
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:03,910
Wait, there's a down.

1300
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:06,090
Oh, shit!

1301
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:06,770
I wasn't him!

1302
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:11,070
Okay, we're fine.

1303
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:13,510
Okay, I think...

1304
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:48,730
that's also another exploding man yeah yeah never mind it was not the children but it's loot yeah cotton oh my god I paid $90 for one I could have got one for free is there anything up top wee who put spikes on top of an elevator like that's up wait

1305
01:23:52,210 --> 01:24:21,980

1306
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,400
It's the anti-hopal spikes.

1307
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,440
Yeah, they didn't.

1308
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,160
No sleeping on top of the elevators, guys.

1309
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,760
Maybe you cared apart with some?

1310
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,940
I'll offer a fair trade for each.

1311
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,040
Sorry, we're the official symbols.

1312
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:40,140
The king and his knights are long gone.

1313
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:40,400
Wait.

1314
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:41,000
What?

1315
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:43,840
Oh, is this cell?

1316
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,040
Oh, this is where I sell this.

1317
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,700
Do I sell them?

1318
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:53,240
Must Man, Wakanda's not very inclusive, guys.

1319
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,140
Oh, yeah, it's alright.

1320
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:01,260
So it's so for bugs like me to not be able to parkour.

1321
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,240
Okay, I'll sell one.

1322
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,440
You know the kingdom's five great knights?

1323
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:18,040
They're revered figures of a hollow nest often mentioned in the annals of the...

1324
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,460
in the in-house of the kingdom.

1325
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,060
Bahoni has a roof.

1326
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,940
Both their names and parents seem to have been expunged from history.

1327
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,280
So long has passed since their time.

1328
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,240
It'd be a grand achievement to discover Daryd Anthony's.

1329
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,520
Okay, I'll keep one of them then.

1330
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,940
Just for the sake of it.

1331
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:39,840
It's down the city?

1332
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,760
Alright, down, I'll go.

1333
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:49,880
Wait, no.

1334
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,580
It says up for the city.

1335
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:52,680
Okay.

1336
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,960
Wait, up is city?

1337
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,380
Wait, what?

1338
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,220
Would I go up or down?

1339
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,360
What's here?

1340
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:12,740
A mechanism of a simple keyhole.

1341
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:13,560
Oh!

1342
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,240
Oh, I don't have the key.

1343
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:16,760
I forgot to buy the key.

1344
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,440
I was broke at that time.

1345
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,740
I didn't really forgot.

1346
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,940
I was just poor.

1347
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:27,940
Oh!

1348
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,060
Plot.

1349
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,460
Oh, it's a sign for the vendor.

1350
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,460
Oh, I see.

1351
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:45,210
Oh, that's me.

1352
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:47,910
Oh, my God.

1353
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:49,510
We can't touch each other.

1354
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:50,190
We touch each other.

1355
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,390
We're going to open a paradox.

1356
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:54,350
We're going to make a black hole.

1357
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,350
And it'll destroy this land.

1358
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:58,690
Again, we meet little ghost.

1359
01:26:58,930 --> 01:26:59,430
I'm you.

1360
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,190
But from the future.

1361
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:04,010
From the future past.

1362
01:27:04,770 --> 01:28:05,070

1363
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:08,130
Through its sacrifice, Holiness, Last Eternal.

1364
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:12,720
Yeah.

1365
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:14,300
Um.

1366
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,900
Wait, do I not go here?

1367
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,580
This truly is our Silk Song.

1368
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:18,920
Yeah.

1369
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,440
I'm Silk Song.

1370
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:21,780
The prequel.

1371
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,500
And she's Silk Song.

1372
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,440
The present sequel.

1373
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,520
I'm the prequel sequel.

1374
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,860
And she's the present sequel.

1375
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,220
Alright.

1376
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:36,120
Alright.

1377
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:36,640
We go.

1378
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,500
Where the fuck do I go?

1379
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,900
I guess I'll go to the left side.

1380
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,100
Just poke go a little bit.

1381
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,140
Just because I can.

1382
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,460
I don't know where to...

1383
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,660
Oh my god, he killed himself.

1384
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,700
Please, sir, you have so much to live for.

1385
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,960
Is there a map anyway?

1386
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,880
Wait, this is where I parkour to higher ground.

1387
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:10,700
I'm pretty sure.

1388
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,100
Yeah, I think this is where I parkour to higher ground.

1389
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,480
So I can go up now.

1390
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:15,900
Right?

1391
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,360
Should go up.

1392
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,020
Because, like, I can't go anywhere from the right.

1393
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,340
Janelle Smith, where the fuck is that?

1394
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,940
He didn't give me a map for that.

1395
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,240
Because I can't go anywhere here.

1396
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:32,560
Yeah.

1397
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,020
Oh, left was good.

1398
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,300
Check map?

1399
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,620
Yeah, sure, I'll check the map.

1400
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,400
Yeah, let me check the map real quick.

1401
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,620
Alright, sorry, but my internet sounds.

1402
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,760
So, I can't connect to the GPS, guys.

1403
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:54,480
I...

1404
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,380
Sorry, guys.

1405
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,340
I have zero bars right now, so I can't connect to GPS.

1406
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,380
I can't connect to Google Maps, guys.

1407
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,000
I'm sorry.

1408
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,360
Oh, this guy...

1409
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,160
Oh, it's him.

1410
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,140
This has, like, the nail thing.

1411
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,000
Oh, shit.

1412
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,000
I wanted to kill him.

1413
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:23,360
There you go.

1414
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,500
I'm looking at you.

1415
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:28,620
I'm looking at my blank piece of paper.

1416
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:38,010
Like, are you okay, Jane?

1417
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:40,310
Oh, hey.

1418
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:42,470
And not the knife?

1419
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:43,970
Oh, it's more over there.

1420
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:47,190
I was like, why can't I just grab the sword from the ground?

1421
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:48,290
Is that ceiling?

1422
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:49,970
I mean, he's just leaving it there.

1423
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:51,450
It's fine as keepers, you know?

1424
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:55,030
He just leaves it there.

1425
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:56,150
Might as well be mine.

1426
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:01,150
I have no signal, guys.

1427
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:06,370
Have you brought me another nail to be honed?

1428
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:10,910
Leave it on the ground and return later if you're still breathing.

1429
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,770
Oh, I thought you were someone else.

1430
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:18,550
After a nail smith, are you?

1431
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:20,330
Well, you found one.

1432
01:31:20,990 --> 01:31:27,210
I'm not much for a talk, but if it's a nail that needs repair, then you've come to the right bug.

1433
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:30,930
Your nail is quite a sorry state.

1434
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,730
It's obviously not one of mine.

1435
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:38,510
Still, anything can be refined with enough effort and skill.

1436
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:40,830
Even that broken blade.

1437
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:43,610
If you'd like, I can reforge your nail.

1438
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:47,290
I'll make the mint blade far more deadly.

1439
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:48,390
Sure.

1440
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:49,970
It's like $250.

1441
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:51,410
That's like two maps.

1442
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:54,010
Joan shot.

1443
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,230
As you wish.

1444
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:56,730
I'll get to work then.

1445
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:58,230
Whoa!

1446
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:01,490
Wait, he just hits it three times.

1447
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:02,970
I could do that.

1448
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:05,810
There we go.

1449
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:07,770
Their forging is complete.

1450
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:10,070
I've honed your nails edge.

1451
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:13,290
You'll find it much stronger than it used to be.

1452
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:15,710
Mr. Miffluffikens, thank you for the super chat.

1453
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:15,990
Thank you.

1454
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:16,450
Thank you.

1455
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,050
This truly is our silk song.

1456
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:21,150
Head out there and test his strength against his foes.

1457
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,390
Then you do it.

1458
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:26,670
I have an important mission right now.

1459
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:28,190
Like, I don't have the time.

1460
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,870
Okay, he needs a pale ore.

1461
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,510
Yeah, my blade got a manicure, guys.

1462
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:39,830
How much?

1463
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:40,490
Oh, shit!

1464
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:40,850
Wait!

1465
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,850
Oh, now I killed him in two hits.

1466
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:45,930
Check my inventory?

1467
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,240
What?

1468
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,500
What about my inventory?

1469
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:53,960
I don't fucking know.

1470
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,420
Oh, shit.

1471
01:32:58,700 --> 01:32:59,140
Oh, wait.

1472
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,340
This doesn't kill me.

1473
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:01,960
Wait, what the fuck?

1474
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,140
Water doesn't kill me?

1475
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:04,700
That's not accurate.

1476
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,040
Water kills so many bugs.

1477
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,920
I watched this Twitter clip where it was like, it was so sad.

1478
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:14,040
It was like, it was like these two ants being, like getting titanic.

1479
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:23,320
And then like, uh, it was like these two ants getting titanic as the water slowly and slowly like, um, get closer and closer to them.

1480
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:30,380
And then like, and then one of the ants just literally was like, was just like, like flattened by the water.

1481
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:52,540
away in the ocean in the one got swept away by the current and the other ant like literally just got flattened in the water and just stopped moving i'm like is it okay like i was just like oh my god what happened to it is that is that ant okay you think he made it

1482
01:33:55,620 --> 01:35:02,200
i'm gonna try this is that you just what it was a video what do you want me to do like the man the man um the man something like i was like save the ant right now i don't know not watch it it was interesting i was like whoa are they gonna live need us to say they definitely did not live all right see he drowned and oh i'm the bad guy but like why don't i drown he drowned i'm okay thought it was like sonic lure the man the cameraman's manager toky you're so what did i do all i did was watch i was just a bystander that's not evil being a bystander is not evil

1483
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:09,370
It just makes you complicit.

1484
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:13,560
Okay.

1485
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:14,820
I don't know.

1486
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,120
Let's keep going up.

1487
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,380
How do I do this stupid elevator?

1488
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:23,140
Okay, I'll just do this.

1489
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:23,620
Ow.

1490
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:24,900
That hurt.

1491
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,280
That's not nice, buddy.

1492
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,120
Alright.

1493
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,360
Have you heard the bystander?

1494
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,620
Oh, don't act innocent.

1495
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,180
You are all bystanders.

1496
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,380
You've all done it before.

1497
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:56,460
How do I...

1498
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:57,200
Oh, there we go.

1499
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,400
Okay, we go this way.

1500
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:01,840
Let me go up.

1501
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:07,370
Bravo!

1502
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:12,670
Okay, the ones with the little stories are not that scary.

1503
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,710
Are not as threatening.

1504
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:17,990
Like, they barely do anything.

1505
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:18,950
Oh, shit!

1506
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:19,830
Nice.

1507
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:20,990
We're fine.

1508
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:25,810
So I got the little bit of their inside juices on me.

1509
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:27,250
That's alright.

1510
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:28,270
Ow.

1511
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:30,350
That's not cool.

1512
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,890
Has anyone ever told you that's not cool?

1513
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:37,890
Oh, shit.

1514
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:40,510
Alright.

1515
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:41,250
Nice.

1516
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:46,610
Okay, we turn this and then get through here.

1517
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:49,210
Now where do we go?

1518
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:49,730
Ow.

1519
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:51,850
Now I'm here.

1520
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:54,510
Okay, so a shortcut.

1521
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:55,650
Oh, I got a shortcut.

1522
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:58,050
Okay, now what do I do?

1523
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:01,770
Oh, we go up here?

1524
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,650
Being cool doesn't matter.

1525
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:09,630
He has to do her job, Doki.

1526
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:11,030
Okay.

1527
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:16,190
Surprise, I haven't found Map Man yet.

1528
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:21,450
Where do I go?

1529
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:22,690
Oh, there's a bench up top.

1530
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:23,110
Okay.

1531
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:25,570
I like benches.

1532
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:28,770
There?

1533
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:29,850
No?

1534
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,710
Oh, there's the bug.

1535
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:31,710
There's my stipend.

1536
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:33,370
My stipend.

1537
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:35,570
I'm paid by the government.

1538
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,410
Don't worry, little guy.

1539
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:39,730
You'll do okay in foster care.

1540
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:41,290
Because I'll be your parent.

1541
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:43,050
Yay.

1542
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:45,390
My government paycheck.

1543
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:48,070
Oh, there he is.

1544
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:50,030
Wait, wait, what?

1545
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:54,870
Okay, I already fought.

1546
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:57,690
I already killed... Yeah, I was gonna say, what the... Oh, there's more.

1547
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:58,890
Oh, it's like...

1548
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:00,790
I was like, that's not scary.

1549
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,290
These guys, I've killed him so many times.

1550
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:05,290
Okay, I can heal here.

1551
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:07,350
Oh my god, I can't heal here.

1552
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,330
He walks so fast.

1553
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:12,370
Oh, it's just that easy.

1554
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:13,350
It's just three guys.

1555
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:18,010
Turns out, yeah, two waves.

1556
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:46,510
the only evil thing i've done is watching all is watching all the evil things you've done my kamioshi is so evil yeah and you did nothing about it thank you for the super chat that's what i'm saying we're all by standards here All right, time to give.

1557
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:50,490
All right, did the map economy recover, Mr. Cornelius?

1558
01:38:51,650 --> 01:38:54,810
This is just a change from the twisting natural caverns.

1559
01:38:55,930 --> 01:39:02,790
The raid does cast something of a sadness upon all of the architecture simply slender.

1560
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:07,310
Carding, charting, such a different space is quite the challenge.

1561
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:10,090
The one that we eagerly undertaken.

1562
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:14,150
Perhaps you could have purchased a copy of...

1563
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:16,630
Achievement so far.

1564
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:19,990
Oh, man.

1565
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:20,950
It's going up.

1566
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:22,050
The price is going up.

1567
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,570
It stonks up again.

1568
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:26,370
The bubble has recovered.

1569
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:27,050
Oh, my God.

1570
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,790
I can finally look at my goddamn stupid map.

1571
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:32,270
Go.

1572
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:34,110
Joey.

1573
01:39:36,730 --> 01:39:37,650
Alright, let's go.

1574
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:38,890
We go.

1575
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:41,590
Wait, what?

1576
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:43,330
Ow.

1577
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:44,190
Where are you?

1578
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,770
you.

1579
01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:46,810
Alright.

1580
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:49,590
He got better.

1581
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:53,950
I was like, wait a minute, I kill you?

1582
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:55,610
Dude, he just got better.

1583
01:39:57,390 --> 01:39:59,650
He came back from the hostel just to die again.

1584
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:00,750
Wait, what?

1585
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:01,910
What the fuck is that?

1586
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:02,630
Ow!

1587
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:04,970
Okay, he's a wizard.

1588
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:06,970
Oh, no, not nerds.

1589
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:08,370
My greatest weakness.

1590
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,950
Wait, I don't know, like...

1591
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:14,290
Okay.

1592
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:17,690
I'm, like, trying to figure out, like, his patterns.

1593
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:18,410
Oh, alright.

1594
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:19,150
He's a weak...

1595
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:21,450
Oh, like, all magic users, they're weak as hell.

1596
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:23,070
I forgot about that.

1597
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,950
They're weak to melee.

1598
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:29,750
So sanctum.

1599
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:31,390
Where the fuck am I now?

1600
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:36,690
That's right.

1601
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:38,830
Your magic means nothing!

1602
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,530
When I have Ungabunga.

1603
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:46,330
Where are I?

1604
01:40:46,350 --> 01:40:48,350
Go, anyway, I'm gonna go left side first.

1605
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:53,330
What?

1606
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:01,850
What's this?

1607
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:03,890
Wait, this is slop?

1608
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:06,570
God damn, I should have bought the fucking key!

1609
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:08,990
Where is the stack, Peter?

1610
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:13,290
Oh my god.

1611
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:17,910
Can't believe it.

1612
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:21,410
I should have fucking... God damn it.

1613
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:22,490
I should have...

1614
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,810
Oh wait, there's a lot here to hit.

1615
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:27,030
I see it.

1616
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:28,990
Oh, secret!

1617
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:31,710
Oh, it's a shortcut!

1618
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:32,910
Oh shit.

1619
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:36,610
The anti-parkour spikes are there.

1620
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:39,830
Yeah, I was gonna say, like, why is he singing?

1621
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:46,330
Oh, I need a different key.

1622
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:48,770
Oh, the key I have wouldn't have worked at any way.

1623
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,690
Okay, that's good.

1624
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:51,650
That's good to know.

1625
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:57,390
I'm actually have to have it go all the way down.

1626
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:02,170
I hate the elevators here.

1627
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:07,230
Okay, I'll go this way first.

1628
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:09,990
Magic user.

1629
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:12,870
Ow.

1630
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:15,830
Oh, shit!

1631
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:17,750
God!

1632
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:26,090
Fucking oh my god oh my god the fact that it goes through walls is you're such an asshole

1633
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:32,650
it goes through walls and that's what fucks with me the most

1634
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:53,940
it let's see can't go through here all right can't go through here either so i have to do the parkour thing But it went through the thingy.

1635
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:56,560
It goes through...

1636
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,980
Okay, at least it goes through floors.

1637
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,860
It goes through floors, I would say.

1638
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:09,090
Oh my god, they're so annoying, though.

1639
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:11,430
The mind still limits us, though.

1640
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:14,950
How did it break past its constraint to take a period of focus?

1641
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:16,430
Is it even possible?

1642
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,190
That's disgusting.

1643
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,770
Not even Mother can love.

1644
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:25,390
One, two, three.

1645
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:27,770
Where did I open?

1646
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:28,770
Okay, I opened that.

1647
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:29,750
All right, nice.

1648
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:32,730
Oh, I have to go all the way down.

1649
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:37,060
Sorry.

1650
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:38,840
I love him.

1651
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:41,520
Oops.

1652
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:43,560
Oh, I'm sorry!

1653
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:44,080
Oh!

1654
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,500
Oh, my God.

1655
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:50,820
I'm so sorry.

1656
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:51,640
What's that?

1657
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:31,090

Oh my god, I hate you.

1659
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:34,690
I hate you so much.

1660
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,870
Oh, you went all the way down here.

1661
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:40,390
You fucking pussy.

1662
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:42,890
That's right.

1663
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:45,630
I don't mind tanking that.

1664
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:47,910
Okay, I don't like this level.

1665
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,050
I don't like the magic users here.

1666
01:44:52,510 --> 01:44:54,730
The magic users are very annoying.

1667
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:58,910
Okay, that unlocks here.

1668
01:44:59,110 --> 01:45:00,050
So what is downstairs?

1669
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:04,710
More magic users, of course.

1670
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:06,030
A fucking curse.

1671
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:07,170
That's what that is.

1672
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:09,050
Of course, that's what's downstairs.

1673
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:10,370
There's more you guys!

1674
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:14,750
Yeah, I'm fine with these.

1675
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:18,850
Filthy mages.

1676
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:22,010
Whoops.

1677
01:45:25,210 --> 01:45:27,390
Yeah, the basement nerds.

1678
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:29,070
What's over here?

1679
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:30,850
Oh, it's just shortcut.

1680
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:32,930
Wait, did I unlock it already?

1681
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,090
Alright, I do again.

1682
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:34,610
Okay, I did.

1683
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:35,170
Alright.

1684
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:37,110
Go up.

1685
01:45:37,570 --> 01:45:38,610
Better not respawn.

1686
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:40,510
I swear to God.

1687
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:42,810
I'm calling their mothers.

1688
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,640
Alright, up, up, up.

1689
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:50,960
Down, down, down.

1690
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:51,700
Up.

1691
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,780
Andrew, thank you for the raid.

1692
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:54,260
Thank you.

1693
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,060
Thank you.

1694
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:57,160
Alright.

1695
01:45:58,180 --> 01:45:59,300
Is it up, I go?

1696
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:00,580
Oh shit!

1697
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,200
Where the fuck did he come from?

1698
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:09,670
The guy came from nowhere.

1699
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:11,530
It was like a drive-by.

1700
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,440
Uh, no, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1701
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,660
Uh, hey Adoki, next time you!

1702
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,960
Okay, that's unlocked.

1703
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:24,420
Next time you!

1704
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,940
Say that bench, keep trying to equip a talisman, even when your slots are full.

1705
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,520
It's a special mechanic?

1706
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,020
Wait, what happens if I do that?

1707
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,040
Oh my god, of course I miss.

1708
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:36,080
Whoa.

1709
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:38,980
I seriously, I hate you.

1710
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:39,580
I hate you.

1711
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:41,260
Ah!

1712
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:42,700
Where am I?

1713
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:44,240
Where am I?

1714
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:47,960
Okay.

1715
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:52,960
Okay, that's fine.

1716
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:53,460
That's fine.

1717
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:55,400
That's fine.

1718
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,100
I'll just tank it.

1719
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:56,620
That's okay.

1720
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:02,630
I don't know what.

1721
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:04,190
I'm like a little lost here.

1722
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:08,610
I can't.

1723
01:47:08,650 --> 01:47:09,470
break this.

1724
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:12,010
I don't understand.

1725
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:15,730
Why wouldn't let me break that?

1726
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:16,670
Oh my gosh.

1727
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:26,330
I have a feeling that the boss for this area is very closely related to this magic user.

1728
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,560
I'm pretty sure.

1729
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,540
Why do you look like Hornet?

1730
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,500
I'm playing Silk Song.

1731
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:39,740
I don't understand.

1732
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:41,180
Is this not Silk Sun?

1733
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:46,520
Oh my god, no.

1734
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,100
Oh my god, somebody call the Ghostbusters!

1735
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,540
Oh my god, somebody call the Ghostbusters!

1736
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,400
We're okay.

1737
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:02,960
There's still more?

1738
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,140
Oh, Spell Twister.

1739
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:07,960
What's that?

1740
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,120
Blunt Desire the Remaster Improves the Bear's ability to cast spells.

1741
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,440
Reduces the Soul Cost.

1742
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:15,280
Oh, okay.

1743
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,020
Oh shit.

1744
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,660
Oh, so it cost less souls.

1745
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:18,560
Gas spells.

1746
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:20,500
Yeah, I got the early access.

1747
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:26,600
Okay, where is this?

1748
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,660
Well, I'll never know where this is.

1749
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:31,820
Okay, down I go.

1750
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:32,660
Oh.

1751
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,400
There's a lot of souls here.

1752
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,200
Oh.

1753
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:39,260
Alright.

1754
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:44,100
I have a feeling that that might be a boss fight.

1755
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:46,340
Become the nerd.

1756
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:48,820
Yeah, I'll...

1757
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,320
I'll be right back.

1758
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:55,420
Wait, is there something here?

1759
01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:59,600
I want to double check.

1760
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:03,910
Alright.

1761
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:06,130
Yeah, not suspicious at all.

1762
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:08,270
Why did it give me three jars of souls?

1763
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:09,650
For free.

1764
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:11,670
Alright.

1765
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:13,030
Guess I'll die.

1766
01:49:16,330 --> 01:49:16,810
Hello?

1767
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:18,610
Hello?

1768
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:19,690

1769
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:37,510

1771
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:53,910
How the fuck do I dodge that?

1772
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:55,790
Excuse me?

1773
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:58,870
Okay, this is actually bullshit.

1774
01:49:59,070 --> 01:49:59,950
Like, I don't know.

1775
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:03,850
Like, I don't know what to do.

1776
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:10,210
Like, am I even allowed to heal?

1777
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:11,810
Nope.

1778
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:15,970
Alright, there we go.

01:50:18,150 --> 01:50:19,070

Okay.

1791
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:28,350
I gotta be super patient here.

1792
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:30,990
when he does these stupid spells.

1793
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:34,250
Okay.

1794
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:38,150
Okay.

1795
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:42,730
That's...

1796
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:43,530
I'm not using magic.

1797
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:46,270
He is, like, way too...

1798
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:48,710
He's way too, like...

1799
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:53,690
He moves, like, way too fast to use spells.

1800
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:57,390
This guy?

1801
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:58,330
Oh, my God.

1802
01:51:58,350 --> 01:51:59,170
Wait, first try?

1803
01:51:59,870 --> 01:52:00,270
That's right.

1804
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:01,330
Get in the locker, nerd.

1805
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:03,030
That's fucking right.

1806
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,510
I'm going to give you a goddamn swirly.

1807
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:14,790
No magic's going to fucking save you.

1808
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:15,550
Oh, no.

1809
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:16,710
It's the second phase two.

1810
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:17,410
Oh, shit.

1811
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:17,730
I'm sorry.

1812
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:21,810
I'm just joking.

1813
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:23,490
I was just joking.

1814
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:28,310
I didn't hit me.

1815
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:29,530
I'm sorry.

1816
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:30,670
I'm so sorry.

1817
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:35,550
It didn't mean it Oh my god.

1818
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:39,150
Oh my god the nerds fighting back the nerds fighting back

1819
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:45,170
It was just a joke.

1820
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:46,630
It was just a joke.

1821
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:47,790
I'm sorry.

1822
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:49,330
I'm sorry.

1823
01:52:49,590 --> 01:52:54,650
I was just joking No, you're really great

1824
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:01,560
That's crazy.

1825
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,000
Oh my god.

1826
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,260
Oh, fuck!

1827
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:09,700
Okay, I can't do that heal.

1828
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,460
That's way too risky.

1829
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,600
Are you serious?

1830
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:19,680
Oh my god, it's just I accidentally bounced into him.

1831
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:27,020
Okay.

1832
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:30,520
I'm like trying to figure out when I can heal.

1833
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:33,600
God damn it.

1834
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:34,660
I don't know.

1835
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,160
Okay, that's good.

1836
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,320
I get, like, one heal.

1837
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:42,560
I'm fine with that.

1838
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:46,080
Okay.

1839
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:47,720
Nice.

1840
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:49,360
Alright.

1841
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:50,440
That's right.

1842
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:52,100
Now we take you to the swirly.

1843
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,160
That's right.

1844
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:53,680
Get over here.

1845
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:54,880

1846
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,240
That's right.

1847
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:58,020
That's right.

1848
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:02,700

Okay, is that even good?

1852
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:49,350
Whoops.

1853
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:51,890
I used up all my souls for that.

1854
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:53,090
Oopsie.

1855
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:54,430

1856
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:01,570
He had invincibility frames?

1857
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:02,930
Oh.

1858
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:05,850
Okay.

1859
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:09,150
Oh, so that's what it was for.

1860
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:10,410
The breaking thing.

1861
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,230
Oh.

1862
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:13,810
What the fuck is this ghost doing here?

1863
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:31,130
It's so hard to get it right I'm having trouble like I'm having trouble getting it to work

1864
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:54,410
Yeah I just can't I'm holding down!

1865
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:56,490
I swear to God!

1866
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:59,310
I swear to God, I'm holding down.

1867
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:01,490
I'm not fucking with you guys.

1868
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:05,550
I'm holding down.

1869
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:06,290
I swear.

1870
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:09,850
I swear to God I need more souls.

1871
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:14,110
But I thought there was one guy over here.

1872
01:56:17,410 --> 01:56:18,490
I'm holding B.

1873
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:19,430
I swear!

1874
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:23,590
I swear to God, I'm holding V.

1875
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:28,630
Oh, I don't need a jump.

1876
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:30,590
Oh my God, I'm so stupid.

1877
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:33,430
I thought I needed to jump.

1878
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:35,470
I...

1879
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:39,770
Wait, what do I do?

1880
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,130
I'm stuck here.

1881
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:46,010
Okay, good.

1882
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:48,850
We actually need this or I'll be like softlocked.

1883
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:50,890
Wait, what?

1884
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:55,190
There we go.

1885
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:58,070
Okay, I figured it out.

1886
01:56:58,350 --> 01:56:58,970
I was...

1887
01:56:58,970 --> 01:57:00,150
I didn't need a jump.

1888
01:57:01,670 --> 01:57:02,910
It does work mid-air.

1889
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:03,970
I don't know how.

1890
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:05,550
See?

1891
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:07,130
I don't understand.

1892
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:15,550
Please.

1893
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:18,710
Wait, where am I now?

1894
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:19,370
Oh, shit.

1895
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:23,670
Oh, my God.

1896
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:24,430
Oh, my God.

1897
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:25,090
Oh, my God.

1898
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:25,710
Get me out of here.

1899
01:57:27,970 --> 01:57:28,610
No!

1900
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:31,860
No!

1901
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:33,580
Where?

1902
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:35,820
Oh, okay, thank God I spawned here.

1903
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:41,420
I first tried a boss, but I got killed by a little ghosty man.

1904
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,200
You're so strong.

1905
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:50,780
These little ghosty men.

1906
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,400
Oh, hey, there's a...

1907
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,760
Oh my god, please.

1908
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,480
Please, please, please free me.

1909
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:02,560
There we go.

1910
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:11,780
How do I get out of here?

1911
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:18,020
My one fear are these ghosty mans.

1912
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:23,720
They are the hardest boss in this game.

1913
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:31,900
They didn't warn me that these will be the hardest boss in silk styling.

1914
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:42,020
Nice.

1915
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,500
$20 from the government.

1916
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:44,080
Let's go.

1917
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:50,490
Alright.

1918
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:53,750
Go up.

1919
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:55,970
Jesus Christ!

1920
01:58:56,430 --> 01:58:57,350
That's not fair!

1921
01:58:58,670 --> 01:58:59,850
I wasn't ready for that.

1922
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:01,710
Wait, what's over on the left side, actually?

1923
01:59:02,610 --> 01:59:04,110
I didn't go fully up, I think.

1924
01:59:04,830 --> 01:59:05,490
Or did I?

1925
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:06,830
Oh, I did.

1926
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:09,530
Yeah, there's nothing here.

1927
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:12,150
Except for that one little guy.

1928
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:17,060
Alright.

1929
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:18,780
Nice, we're out of here.

1930
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:20,000
Did I finish this area?

1931
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:22,360
Okay.

1932
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,400
Was Magic Man the last guy?

1933
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:28,300
The only boss in this area, chat?

1934
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,000
Or let's practice.

1935
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,360
Okay, we did it.

1936
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,480
Okay, I'm getting better.

1937
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,660
Alright, guys, I'm getting better at it.

1938
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:45,180
See, it's just like the wall riding.

1939
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:46,700
I got better.

1940
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,140
It's just...

1941
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:51,020
It's just like the wall riding.

1942
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:52,620
We got better at it.

1943
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:53,860
Eventually.

1944
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:57,500
Gotta get out of here.

1945
01:59:58,960 --> 01:59:59,600
I got it.

1946
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:00,880
I figured it out.

1947
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:02,420
I downloaded the algorithm.

1948
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:07,720
Oh, I just didn't have enough.

1949
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:10,360
I was like, do I not download the algorithm?

1950
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,140
I just didn't have enough.

1951
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:19,340
Spirit of God, these guys are harder than the fucking boss I fought.

1952
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:24,560
Because, like, they teleport more than the other guy.

1953
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,260
They actually teleport more.

1954
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:33,740
Wait, why did I go back here?

1955
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:40,520
I don't understand.

1956
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:41,280
Did I finish that?

1957
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:41,760
Oh, wait.

1958
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:43,120
Oh, that was the shortcut area.

1959
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:46,040
Now what do I do?

1960
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:49,640
That beat it?

1961
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:51,420
I don't know.

1962
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,680
I don't know.

1963
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:58,580
Like, oh, I got what I need?

1964
02:00:58,700 --> 02:00:59,000
Okay.

1965
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,920
I'm gonna go back to the bench then.

1966
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:04,300
It's here, right?

1967
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:04,840
Okay, here we go.

1968
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:07,720
All right.

1969
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:08,920
Oh, he's gone.

1970
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,040
Sorry, I didn't see you.

1971
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:18,720
If you lost, why not pop up because I started and did not purchase a map of this area available now for an excellent price.

1972
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:22,690
All right.

1973
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,050
I'm done with this area.

1974
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:27,850
I feel like I explored most of everything except for it here.

1975
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:31,410
Assume this is like...

1976
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:33,130
Yeah, this is how to get home.

1977
02:01:33,290 --> 02:01:33,550
Okay.

1978
02:01:34,890 --> 02:02:07,010
I mean, there is an area bottom okay I'm gonna check what bottom right is the conifer 8 is insane he deserves it all right nice this way here no that's where I got the I would go down that didn't get me whoops this way no It's just to the right.

1979
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:11,650
I haven't been here, I think.

1980
02:02:11,790 --> 02:02:13,510
Oh, I can't go here, anyway.

1981
02:02:15,290 --> 02:02:16,750
I was like, oh, I haven't been here.

1982
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:17,470
JK.

1983
02:02:18,370 --> 02:02:20,490
There was just no option for me to go there.

1984
02:02:23,730 --> 02:02:24,170
Alright.

1985
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:25,250
Let's go up.

1986
02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:27,410
Up again.

1987
02:02:30,630 --> 02:02:31,510
And then...

1988
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:32,310
To the left.

1989
02:02:34,270 --> 02:02:35,990
What for having a hot?

1990
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:36,290
way.

1991
02:02:36,570 --> 02:02:39,450
No, for having a fucking monopoly on maps.

1992
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:42,170
I'm tired of this map capitalism.

1993
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:45,430
Sometimes I don't want to participate in capitalism.

1994
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:51,610
Watch where you're going, man.

1995
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:53,130
You soggy vagabond.

1996
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:55,410
I don't want you splashing on me.

1997
02:02:55,950 --> 02:02:58,650
I've had a miserable time trying to keep dry.

1998
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:02,810
I play game to escape.

1999
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:06,090
Not contribute to a goddamn monopoly.

2000
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:14,950
I am so mighty.

2001
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:17,250
Knight of Green Renown.

2002
02:03:17,910 --> 02:03:22,130
If I decide that I'm going to stay dry, man, then that's what's going to happen.

2003
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:24,690
Curse this wretched city.

2004
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:27,750
Water and monster constantly fall from above.

2005
02:03:28,330 --> 02:03:31,890
It's no wonder this plastic kingdom falls to ruin.

2006
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:35,310
No, she saved him.

2007
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:38,890
What's wrong with him?

2008
02:03:39,490 --> 02:03:41,350
a jolly old man.

2009
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:45,310
He just seems like a boomer.

2010
02:03:52,530 --> 02:03:53,330
Where am I?

2011
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:59,650
I like how that guy threw a spike and I'm just looking at my map, ignoring him.

2012
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:02,730
Just like, where did I go?

2013
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:07,470
He's like, I'm gonna get him.

2014
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:09,370
I'm like, where am I?

2015
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:21,580
Go up.

2016
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,160
Okay, there's bench up here

2017
02:04:26,830 --> 02:04:32,850

What's that?

2020
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,000
Alright.

2021
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:07,040
What did I get?

2022
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:08,060
What is that?

2023
02:05:11,590 --> 02:05:13,370
Joe left behind by long-dead traveler.

2024
02:05:13,570 --> 02:05:16,350
The words are written in a forgotten dialect and difficult to understand.

2025
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:20,310
It holds low value except for those dedicated to the kingdom's history.

2026
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:21,510
Oh, I can...

2027
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:22,650
Wait, I can read it?

2028
02:05:23,230 --> 02:05:24,010
No, I can't.

2029
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:24,770
I'm illiterate.

2030
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:26,850
My bug is illiterate.

2031
02:05:28,190 --> 02:05:29,790
Okay, he doesn't need a read.

2032
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:30,570
He just got...

2033
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:32,890
She just got to look pretty for silk sign.

2034
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:37,070
Oh, there we go.

2035
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:41,890
There's the stag.

2036
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:46,390
Okay, got the couch.

2037
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:47,610
I mean, got the bench.

2038
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:51,230
Alright, time to pay for this, too.

2039
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:53,950
Let's take all my money, I guess.

2040
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:58,380
Oh.

2041
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:00,840
But I can afford stuff.

2042
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,940
I can afford the key now.

2043
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:03,980
Alright, I need to go up top.

2044
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:07,420
Yo.

2045
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:11,000
Open several stack stations now, haven't you?

2046
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:13,380
I'm thankful for the opportunity.

2047
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:18,280
As I visit more places, I feel my memories returning to me.

2048
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:22,440
Like the stack waves of my mind are running once more.

2049
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:27,080
Continue to open the station, and you'll have my deepest gratitude.

2050
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:28,480
Alright, let's buy some upgrades.

2051
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:40,470
I can get a key from free?

2052
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:44,630
Alright, first I left by.

2053
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:45,190
What?

2054
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:46,250
Let's buy.

2055
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:47,830
Let's see what good things they have.

2056
02:06:48,650 --> 02:06:49,230
I mean, I could.

2057
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:50,450
It's 150.

2058
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:51,510
It's not that much.

2059
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:53,710
Nice.

2060
02:06:54,830 --> 02:06:55,270
Yeah!

2061
02:06:59,710 --> 02:07:00,150
Uh...

2062
02:07:00,930 --> 02:07:01,670
Oh, wait.

2063
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:02,070
I can...

2064
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:06,050
What's that?

2065
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:07,930
What do I get?

2066
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:08,630
Do I get a key?

2067
02:07:08,930 --> 02:07:10,010
I'll get a key, actually.

2068
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:15,820
Uh...

2069
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:19,340
I mean, I could just buy all of these.

2070
02:07:25,250 --> 02:07:25,610
Yay!

2071
02:07:26,510 --> 02:07:27,350
Another mask.

2072
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:29,610
This?

2073
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:30,530
Vessel fragment?

2074
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:40,120
Oh, I guess that gives me more stuff I can equip for charms.

2075
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,720
Alright, spent all my money.

2076
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:49,360
Alright, so we need...

2077
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,280
City store room.

2078
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:55,280
You guys said I can grab a key at the bottom?

2079
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:02,980
Where's the key?

2080
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:10,760
Wait, do I have more soul slot, uh, charm slots?

2081
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:12,720
No, I don't.

2082
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:13,760
I'm still fucking poor.

2083
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:20,480
Where's the key?

2084
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:22,900
Oh, did y'all lie to me?

2085
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:27,140
A load of city storerooms.

2086
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:28,580
Where the fuck is that?

2087
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:30,600
Where the fuck is that?

2088
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,220
Go down then, right?

2089
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:37,260
Okay, I'm gonna check what's over here.

2090
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:43,580
What's this?

2091
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:46,480
Toll symbol.

2092
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:47,800
Wait, what?

2093
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:49,700
Or what?

2094
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:55,320
What do I need that for?

2095
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:02,290
Oh my god.

2096
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:03,370
Now I need a fucking...

2097
02:09:03,370 --> 02:09:04,310
I spent all my money.

2098
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:06,450
Go down.

2099
02:09:06,570 --> 02:09:07,470
It's another shortcut.

2100
02:09:07,690 --> 02:09:07,870
Oh.

2101
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:10,130
Then where?

2102
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:11,450
Then left or right?

2103
02:09:16,590 --> 02:09:18,550
Okay, I need money, so I'm gonna kill you.

2104
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:19,910
I'm gonna rob you real quick.

2105
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:20,670
I'm gonna mug you.

2106
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:21,710
Get over down from here.

2107
02:09:22,230 --> 02:09:23,290
I need to mug you.

2108
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:23,730
Ow.

2109
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:25,230
Get down from here.

2110
02:09:25,910 --> 02:09:28,290
Come on, you can't keep throwing these sticks all day.

2111
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:29,830
There we go.

2112
02:09:30,090 --> 02:09:30,970
Thanks for the money.

2113
02:09:31,190 --> 02:09:31,730
Oh, shit!

2114
02:09:32,730 --> 02:09:33,450
Oh, hey, shortcut.

2115
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:37,410
I'm gonna shake you.

2116
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:38,470
I'm gonna mug you real quick.

2117
02:09:42,230 --> 02:09:44,110
Oh, I can't go down right yet.

2118
02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:44,670
Okay.

2119
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:48,150
I want to grab the toll first.

2120
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:49,750
Oh, shit.

2121
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:54,300
What's over here?

2122
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:56,420
Why were there a bunch of them down here?

2123
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:01,680
Alright.

2124
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:03,520
Crime core.

2125
02:10:10,190 --> 02:10:11,450
Oh, hey, what's this?

2126
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:14,290
Hey, what's this?

2127
02:10:14,330 --> 02:10:16,050
There's just a random tree down here.

2128
02:10:17,370 --> 02:10:18,350
What is that?

2129
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:23,410
What is this?

2130
02:10:24,070 --> 02:10:24,870
Why is there a tree?

2131
02:10:25,470 --> 02:10:26,330
Oh, it's for later?

2132
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:29,550
Oh, okay.

2133
02:10:29,970 --> 02:10:31,890
Yeah, I was like, why is there a random tree here?

2134
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:33,750
Who let this tree be here?

2135
02:10:38,610 --> 02:10:40,110
Oh, I forgot to unlock this door.

2136
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:44,430
Oh, it's just more backtracking stuff.

2137
02:10:45,490 --> 02:10:46,370
Oh, yeah, for my...

2138
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:47,970
The Metrovania part.

2139
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:49,130
Alright.

2140
02:10:50,490 --> 02:10:52,050
Like, don't worry about it.

2141
02:10:53,310 --> 02:10:55,590
What if I want to worry about it?

2142
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,390
What do you mean?

2143
02:10:57,130 --> 02:10:59,150
That means there's something to worry about.

2144
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:00,770
I wasn't worrying about it.

2145
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:01,930
Now I am.

2146
02:11:04,830 --> 02:11:05,810
This top, right?

2147
02:11:07,110 --> 02:11:08,030
This top, right?

2148
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:11,430
Oh, this guy.

2149
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,270
I'm just going to force it.

2150
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:18,290
Alright.

2151
02:11:19,470 --> 02:11:20,570
Oh, I got this key.

2152
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:21,790
Wait, I got another key?

2153
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:24,990
Wait, does anyone remember where the locked door is?

2154
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:26,290
Because I did not mark it.

2155
02:11:26,650 --> 02:11:27,210
Alright, guys.

2156
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:28,430
It's time to find out.

2157
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:30,070
Guys, where is the...

2158
02:11:32,230 --> 02:11:33,510
Alright, where is the door?

2159
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:35,150
Is it this door?

2160
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:35,950
Oh, it's this door.

2161
02:11:37,150 --> 02:11:37,490
Okay.

2162
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:39,590
It's right here.

2163
02:11:39,630 --> 02:11:40,390
I remember now.

2164
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:41,330
It's this door.

2165
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:42,410
Okay, we can go there.

2166
02:11:44,390 --> 02:11:45,610
Can I open that door now?

2167
02:11:47,590 --> 02:11:48,030
Ow.

2168
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:53,240
Oh, not that door?

2169
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:53,900
Which door?

2170
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:56,660
Which one?

2171
02:11:58,280 --> 02:11:59,580
If it's not this door?

2172
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:06,300
It's not that one?

2173
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,260
Then which door do I open?

2174
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:11,340
Near the nail smith?

2175
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:13,320
There's a door near the nail smith?

2176
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:14,860
I don't remember no door.

2177
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:21,410
Oh, this door?

2178
02:12:24,590 --> 02:12:25,030
Down.

2179
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:27,030
Oh, this over here.

2180
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:27,530
Okay.

2181
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:28,450
Yeah, we can do that.

2182
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:29,910
Let me open the...

2183
02:12:30,490 --> 02:12:33,110
Let me open the other door for so many doors.

2184
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:39,960
Okay, I'm going to open this door first.

2185
02:12:46,350 --> 02:12:49,530
I open this door and then we'll go to the other door.

2186
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:54,250
Yes, please.

2187
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:58,010
What happens here?

2188
02:12:58,830 --> 02:13:00,930
Oh my god, that's a giant-ass door.

2189
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:03,450
Alright.

2190
02:13:04,030 --> 02:13:05,310
I don't know where it takes me.

2191
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:12,060
Where am I?

2192
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:12,760
Oh, yeah.

2193
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:25,080

2195
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,060
Okay, let's check it out.

2196
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:48,280
Where am I?

2197
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,280
Oh, there's a depressed man.

2198
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,040
Don't worry, I'll put you out in your misery, guys.

2199
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:58,120
Ow!

2200
02:13:58,280 --> 02:13:59,380
Wait, you can just do that?

2201
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:04,050
Oh, shit!

2202
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:05,390
Oh, shit!

2203
02:14:05,710 --> 02:14:06,610
Wait, that's illegal.

2204
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:09,770
Yeah.

2205
02:14:11,230 --> 02:14:12,570
I'll go this way first.

2206
02:14:14,910 --> 02:14:17,450
That really parkour when I'm just going to go straight.

2207
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:21,270
Oh, there's the loot.

2208
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:25,310
Oh, I should really heal.

2209
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:28,230
What did I get?

2210
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:31,850
Oh, it's another soul fragment thing.

2211
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:34,550
Okay, nice.

2212
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:36,390
Dippy loot.

2213
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:47,060
Mostly use spells for the boss fights, because they're like, they do more damage from what I've noticed.

2214
02:14:47,340 --> 02:15:16,070
there's nothing here so I'll just go this way down I go down I go all right time to open that door now I'll collect my government paycheck later I gotta go to that sewer area it's not here

2215
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:24,320
Wee!

2216
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:29,990
Wait.

2217
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:31,770
Which is faster.

2218
02:15:31,870 --> 02:15:32,890
Okay, this way is faster.

2219
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:35,510
Yeah, I'll collect the welfare later.

2220
02:15:37,850 --> 02:15:39,490
For fostering these children.

2221
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:44,370
Oh, she's gonna love the sewers.

2222
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:47,590
I have a feeling that means I might not love it.

2223
02:15:49,550 --> 02:15:52,670
I swear, is it a poison sewer, guys?

2224
02:15:53,210 --> 02:15:54,990
Is it a poison sewer?

2225
02:15:56,150 --> 02:15:58,390
Is that why I'm gonna love the sewer?

2226
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:03,930
Every time they put, like, a sewer level, it's usually poison.

2227
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:05,770
Or rats.

2228
02:16:06,630 --> 02:16:08,270
It's one or the other.

2229
02:16:08,770 --> 02:16:10,630
Gee, thank you for the five gift of chips.

2230
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:11,510
Thank you, thank you.

2231
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:12,710
I really appreciate it.

2232
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:16,670
All right, down I go.

2233
02:16:18,950 --> 02:16:19,370
Wee.

2234
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:20,990
Oh, shortcut.

2235
02:16:22,610 --> 02:16:23,710
I don't even know this side area.

2236
02:16:26,530 --> 02:16:57,230
all right well nope nope down down no down down good boy I said down down okay now where do I go it's this way okay it's not this way oh my god oh my god I'm gonna die to a regular thing that was close that was so close I got a loss.

2237
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:58,370
I was like, where am I?

2238
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:02,110
Okay, down.

2239
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:02,570
No!

2240
02:17:02,670 --> 02:17:03,470
Okay, down, yeah.

2241
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:11,740
Okay, it's this way.

2242
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:13,520
So I had to, like, double-check.

2243
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:18,660
Alright, now!

2244
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:20,000
We got the key!

2245
02:17:23,930 --> 02:17:25,390
Okay, we figured it out.

2246
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:30,020
I have no data.

2247
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:31,780
I have no signal down here.

2248
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:33,880
My map GPS isn't working.

2249
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:47,820
this is bad I literally zero data in my map GPS what the fuck what is that are those worms

2250
02:17:51,820 --> 02:18:03,900
oh my god what the fuck is that okay I got Pogo these guys oh my god of course they're down here too

2251
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:09,620
It's a bug, dokey.

2252
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:11,800
Yeah, oh, oh my god, really?

2253
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:18,400
Oh my god, a bug in my hollow knight?

2254
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:20,060
Sorry, my silk song game?

2255
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:21,940
Ooh, that's odd.

2256
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:24,180
Oh, wait.

2257
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:27,100
Okay, there's a bench here.

2258
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:27,580
That's good.

2259
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:28,840
I actually really need a bench.

2260
02:18:34,860 --> 02:18:35,440
Where am I?

2261
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:36,640
Oh, there it is.

2262
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:39,660
What do you mean map updated?

2263
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:42,520
What do you mean?

2264
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:44,260
What am I drawing for?

2265
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:46,220
What am I drawing?

2266
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:47,940
I just drawing a fucking smiley face?

2267
02:18:52,410 --> 02:18:53,670
I don't like this sound.

2268
02:18:54,310 --> 02:18:55,750
Oh my god.

2269
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:57,590
I do not like these enemies.

2270
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:02,070
Okay, there's two of them.

2271
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:03,010
They're like little dogs.

2272
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:09,610
It's like map updated as I just drew a smiley face on the piece of paper.

2273
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,500
Okay.

2274
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:22,740
Wait, that's where I went.

2275
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:27,160
That's, like, where I got the bench.

2276
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:30,780
I guess I can check if there's anything here.

2277
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:34,440
Anything here?

2278
02:19:34,660 --> 02:19:35,360
What the fuck?

2279
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:39,660
Oh, it's like a little pufferfish.

2280
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:43,300
Look at that.

2281
02:19:43,460 --> 02:19:44,100
I'm playing pool.

2282
02:19:46,660 --> 02:19:47,680
Oh, shit.

2283
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:49,960
Get out of here.

2284
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,040
Get out of here!

2285
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:51,960
Oh, shit.

2286
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:52,640
Okay, I can swim.

2287
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:54,240
That's good.

2288
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:55,880
I'll just swim.

2289
02:19:58,260 --> 02:19:59,120
It's okay.

2290
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:00,000
I can float.

2291
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:02,980
That feels a lot more convenient.

2292
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:11,980
I feel like I have to parkour here.

2293
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:15,980
Why did he get over here?

2294
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:21,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, how did you get over here?

2295
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:27,880
I think what sucks is that it doesn't bounce back when I- oh shit.

2296
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,240
It doesn't bounce back when I hit him.

2297
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:39,040
Yeah, that's like really annoying.

2298
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:43,700
Oh my god, get out of here.

2299
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:47,000
We're still alive?

2300
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,640
Oh, he played dead.

2301
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:53,480
What?

2302
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:54,120
Okay, okay.

2303
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,260
Okay, that's not fair.

2304
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:57,500
Should have been dead.

2305
02:21:01,260 --> 02:21:02,080
I hate...

2306
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,080
I hate the sound.

2307
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:03,580
He's like...

2308
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:05,280
He's like, he's choking.

2309
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:08,940
Okay, the map guy has to be here.

2310
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:10,320
I'm following his paper trail.

2311
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:15,760
He's leaving a paper trail of maps for me.

2312
02:21:23,290 --> 02:21:26,210
I don't know exactly where, though, after that.

2313
02:21:34,350 --> 02:21:35,550
Oh my god.

2314
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:36,070
No!

2315
02:21:36,570 --> 02:21:36,910
No!

2316
02:21:37,470 --> 02:21:37,830
No!

2317
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:43,530
I was doing so well!

2318
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:46,950
Where the fuck am I?

2319
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:50,910
Alright, just keep going left.

2320
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:51,510
Okay.

2321
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:57,750
I'll just keep flying.

2322
02:21:58,950 --> 02:22:00,490
Oh hey, what's this?

2323
02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:05,040
Yay!

2324
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,540
I got full mask.

2325
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:07,560
Oh, next you're here.

2326
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:11,240
I got full HP.

2327
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:15,960
But how the fuck do I get back up top?

2328
02:22:21,130 --> 02:22:21,870
Guess I'll go.

2329
02:22:22,210 --> 02:22:23,550
Oh, do I have to go the long way?

2330
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:26,510
I don't think I can get back up top there.

2331
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:30,870
Yeah, I don't think so.

2332
02:22:32,070 --> 02:22:33,450
Because it's that, uh...

2333
02:22:34,830 --> 02:22:35,930
I feel like...

2334
02:22:35,930 --> 02:22:37,290
What the fuck is that?

2335
02:22:38,990 --> 02:22:39,790
What is that?

2336
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:40,790
What the...

2337
02:22:40,790 --> 02:22:41,650
Is that another fact?

2338
02:22:41,770 --> 02:22:43,330
Oh my god, it's another Rancid.

2339
02:22:43,430 --> 02:22:46,130
I have to pay for that, too.

2340
02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:47,950
I don't even know what they're for.

2341
02:22:49,950 --> 02:22:51,230
Oh, yeah, I had to do this again.

2342
02:22:51,790 --> 02:22:53,110
It's a walk of shame.

2343
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,940
Oh, technically I don't even have to kill him.

2344
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,340
Okay, maybe I have to kill this.

2345
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:04,180
Oh, wait, no, I can't.

2346
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:04,720
No, I...

2347
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:06,480
Map fun, SXR.

2348
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:08,020
They give them a Jetta Supa.

2349
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:09,260
Thank you.

2350
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:11,740
I can find this fucker.

2351
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:16,850
Okay, it's this way.

2352
02:23:20,570 --> 02:23:22,830
Is it this way?

2353
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:24,430
Okay.

2354
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:27,150
Gotta follow the trail.

2355
02:23:28,750 --> 02:23:29,930
The map trail.

2356
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:36,420
Eat the money, too.

2357
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:38,800
Are you serious?

2358
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:40,140
No!

2359
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:53,840
Stupid.

2360
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:56,240
Oh, and you're gonna fly!

2361
02:23:56,780 --> 02:24:03,880
The fact that the puffer, the puffer bug was like, I'm not done with you.

2362
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:13,660
The fact that he came back to is like, I'm not done with you.

2363
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:17,520
It follows.

2364
02:24:22,090 --> 02:24:24,730
God, I hate this area so much.

2365
02:24:25,090 --> 02:24:26,550
How dare you touch.

2366
02:24:26,730 --> 02:24:28,310
He touched me!

2367
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:30,630
I was the one that did not consent.

2368
02:24:31,630 --> 02:24:45,910
Oh, God these guys are no wonder you guys were like oh you're gonna love this area you're gonna love it oh you're gonna love this area but you're gonna love it so much

2369
02:24:49,350 --> 02:25:02,090

2370
02:25:05,380 --> 02:25:24,660
I don't even want to touch them that's not even the worst part of the sewage these guys fucking suck all

2371
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:42,450
right get over here knew it going this way now get

2372
02:25:45,930 --> 02:25:49,010
out of here I know you're alive.

2373
02:25:49,170 --> 02:25:50,750
I fought like 20 of you.

2374
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:52,670
You don't have to play dead.

2375
02:25:55,550 --> 02:25:58,250
He's like, no, she's not gonna expect it.

2376
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:00,050
Another resident.

2377
02:26:05,450 --> 02:26:06,850
Oh my god, I could have done that.

2378
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:09,290
I could have just done that.

2379
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:16,290
Oh my god, where is he?

2380
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:18,330
Oh my god, where is he?

2381
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:20,690
How do I, how do I get up there?

2382
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:23,110
Oh, the gates are locked!

2383
02:26:30,350 --> 02:26:33,410
How do you- Oh, is it an arena?

2384
02:26:34,310 --> 02:26:36,570
Oh, I have to kill everything here.

2385
02:26:36,750 --> 02:26:36,970
Okay.

2386
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:38,650
I was so confused.

2387
02:26:38,770 --> 02:26:40,210
I was like, where do I go?

2388
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:42,590
Okay, I'll do one by one.

2389
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:49,060
Okay, that's fine.

2390
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:56,700
I mean, I literally just gotta do it slow but slow and steady.

2391
02:26:57,360 --> 02:26:58,280
It's murder time.

2392
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:01,660
This guy, though.

2393
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:02,880
And this guy.

2394
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:05,020
Wait, I still...

2395
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:07,540
It's still three hits, even with magic?

2396
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,280
You would think it'd be like...

2397
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,840
I thought it'd be like...

2398
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:16,960
Like...

2399
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:17,940
Less hits.

2400
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:21,380
Alright, let's get our goddamn maps.

2401
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:26,980
Oh, aren't these wateries saving?

2402
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:29,200
A labyrinth of pipes and...

2403
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,180
Time notice.

2404
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:34,020
I couldn't ask for a better place to employ my talents.

2405
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:37,080
It's so, so orderly, so considered.

2406
02:27:37,700 --> 02:27:42,680
Nothing like the crude irregularities of those caverns.

2407
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:44,640
That was so sad in my trunk.

2408
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:51,400
It's telling me those fungal ways are close, and I sense my deep, amp adventure may have reached this end.

2409
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:54,280
Guess I'll be calling this map done.

2410
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:56,060
You didn't even...

2411
02:27:56,060 --> 02:27:58,040
I was the one that updated this map.

2412
02:27:58,120 --> 02:27:59,200
What the fuck do you mean?

2413
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:28,240

2414
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:29,400
I was literally, like, right there.

2415
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:31,120
That's, like, that's the worst part.

2416
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:39,200
I'm gonna go the easy way.

2417
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:39,860
Fuck this.

2418
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:42,700
Fuck this.

2419
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:45,820
I'm not dealing with the goddamn inflatable...

2420
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:47,900
Inflatable Settlement.

2421
02:28:48,900 --> 02:28:50,220
Inflatable bendy arms.

2422
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:51,960
McGee over there.

2423
02:28:55,380 --> 02:28:56,300
It's gonna do it this way.

2424
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:01,840
Wait, how do I get out of here?

2425
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:04,880
Oh, I have to go down from this way.

2426
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:09,840
That's fine.

2427
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:14,680
Alright.

2428
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:17,200
Alright, let's see.

2429
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:21,980
Okay, I know that magic doesn't matter for these guys.

2430
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:23,260
Because they do the same.

2431
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:24,440
It does the same damage.

2432
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:30,000
Alright, where do I go?

2433
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:32,840
Okay, I can go down.

2434
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:34,600
Okay.

2435
02:29:37,810 --> 02:29:39,390
I go down.

2436
02:29:39,610 --> 02:29:40,770
Okay, I'm going to rest real quick.

2437
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:44,510
Go rest, and then I can go down again.

2438
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:50,600
Okay, get up.

2439
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:53,560
Alright.

2440
02:29:56,460 --> 02:29:57,420
Oh my god.

2441
02:29:57,660 --> 02:29:58,480
Shut the fuck up.

2442
02:30:01,720 --> 02:30:03,500
Okay, where's another down?

2443
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:04,060
Yeah?

2444
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:04,820
Oh, it's here.

2445
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:08,340
That's not right.

2446
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:09,240
Thank you for the super chat.

2447
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:10,320
You.

2448
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:12,240
Yay, map pun.

2449
02:30:12,380 --> 02:30:14,300
They get rid of the secret chat thingy thing.

2450
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:15,600
Oh, my God.

2451
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:15,940
Whoops.

2452
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:17,340
Look out there.

2453
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,000
I want...

2454
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,420
I try to be fancy.

2455
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:23,820
Alright, now what?

2456
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:25,020
Okay.

2457
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:28,320
Oh, shit.

2458
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:29,080
Oh, my God.

2459
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:30,100
You see...

2460
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:31,980
I got...

2461
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:33,800
My reflexes got the better of me.

2462
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:35,700
I was like, it's done exploding!

2463
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:37,400
It was not done exploding.

2464
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:39,380
Alright.

2465
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:41,560
didn't correct me.

2466
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:43,780
Oh, get me out of here.

2467
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:43,960
Get me out of here.

2468
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:44,760
No, get me out of here.

2469
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:46,820
Get me out of No, just stupid bug.

2470
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:47,080
Okay.

2471
02:30:48,580 --> 02:30:48,920
I'm okay.

2472
02:30:55,820 --> 02:30:57,960
Oh, get me out of here.

2473
02:30:58,140 --> 02:30:58,880
Get me out of here.

2474
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:01,760
It's fine.

2475
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:07,780
Come on.

2476
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:08,960
All right.

2477
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:09,940
We're good.

2478
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:10,260
We're good.

2479
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:10,600
We're good.

2480
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:11,600
We're good.

2481
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:11,900
We're good.

2482
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:12,620
We're okay.

2483
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:17,300
so much.

2484
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:25,540
Okay, so clearly there's something on up top that I missed.

2485
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,800
Oh, this is a boss fight.

2486
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:31,220
Why would there be so many dead bodies?

2487
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:35,040
This is a boss fight room, isn't it?

2488
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:37,140
Oh my god.

2489
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:46,760
There's too many dead bodies for my liking.

2490
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:51,860
Oh, Oh my god, there's a lot of dead bodies here.

2491
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:53,260
I don't like it.

2492
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:09,560

2554
02:38:27,430 --> 02:38:27,890
Oh, my God.

2555
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:30,550
So I was here for no reason.

2556
02:38:34,430 --> 02:38:35,930
How do I get out?

2557
02:38:37,810 --> 02:38:39,910
Bro, she trapped me in here.

2558
02:38:51,100 --> 02:38:52,400
How did I get here?

2559
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:53,380
Oh, I gotta go here.

2560
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:53,820
Okay.

2561
02:38:54,480 --> 02:38:55,700
I was gonna say like...

2562
02:38:57,580 --> 02:39:00,380
I'm at DLC and I can't even leave!

2563
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:02,200
Okay, it's this way.

2564
02:39:06,470 --> 02:39:08,450
I can parkour at least.

2565
02:39:11,470 --> 02:39:12,170
Okay, nice.

2566
02:39:12,590 --> 02:39:17,390
I'm trapped in here with her.

2567
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:24,770
And now where am I?

2568
02:39:25,450 --> 02:39:25,810
Hello?

2569
02:39:26,290 --> 02:39:27,830
Oh, I'm at the fungal area.

2570
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:31,330
I made it all the way to the fungal area.

2571
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:35,590
What the fuck?

2572
02:39:36,390 --> 02:39:39,860
I thought I was in the sewage.

2573
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:49,560
Sounds like a win for me.

2574
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,460
Just don't know where I am.

2575
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:59,100
I gotta find a bench.

2576
02:40:03,670 --> 02:40:05,490
Okay, this is a shortcut to somewhere.

2577
02:40:06,630 --> 02:40:07,410
What the fuck?

2578
02:40:08,250 --> 02:40:08,950
I'm here.

2579
02:40:08,970 --> 02:40:09,790
here now?

2580
02:40:11,710 --> 02:40:12,690
What the fuck?

2581
02:40:15,090 --> 02:40:17,290
Alright, I guess I have to go back to the sewers.

2582
02:40:20,410 --> 02:40:24,290
I'm at the nail sniff, but like, it's no use because I can't even upgrade anything.

2583
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:32,060
Yeah, it was one giant loop.

2584
02:40:33,460 --> 02:40:34,740
Well, technically, oh my gosh.

2585
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:36,640
Technically, it can't even do anything.

2586
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:43,020
Because the loop, I can't go, I can't use it to go back.

2587
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:47,400
I have to go through the sewer from down here.

2588
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:48,640
Yeah, he drowned himself.

2589
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:49,140
Let's go.

2590
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:56,140
Yeah, I don't have any... I don't think I do.

2591
02:40:56,500 --> 02:40:59,100
Alright, time to go back to the worm there.

2592
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:00,560
Okay.

2593
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:03,360
Let me figure out how to do this again.

2594
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:06,900
Have I gone here before?

2595
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:10,060
God damn it.

2596
02:41:12,060 --> 02:41:12,880
Oh, nice.

2597
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:19,630
Okay, I'm just gonna get rid of them because they're so annoying.

2598
02:41:21,890 --> 02:41:24,610
Yeah, he deserved it.

2599
02:41:27,010 --> 02:41:28,790
He deserved to drown.

2600
02:41:29,390 --> 02:41:30,270
We all saw him.

2601
02:41:30,350 --> 02:41:31,230
He was an asshole.

2602
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:33,130
Nobody will remember him.

2603
02:41:40,870 --> 02:41:42,010
Wait, do I go here?

2604
02:41:43,970 --> 02:41:44,510
Oh, here.

2605
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:49,980
Okay, I haven't gone this way yet.

2606
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:53,540
Yeah, I haven't gone this way.

2607
02:41:53,560 --> 02:42:27,440

2608
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:30,740
What the fuck is talking to me?

2609
02:42:33,100 --> 02:42:36,120
They're like, but like I don't see anything.

2610
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:41,780
Is he up top?

2611
02:42:45,190 --> 02:42:47,610
Oh he's up.

2612
02:42:50,410 --> 02:42:52,530
He's like, he's so calm.

2613
02:42:55,090 --> 02:42:56,170
What's that?

2614
02:42:58,390 --> 02:42:58,750
Hello?

2615
02:42:59,970 --> 02:43:01,570

It was not friendly.

2620
02:43:10,070 --> 02:43:10,430
It was bait.

2621
02:43:10,770 --> 02:43:11,190
It was bait.

2622
02:43:12,090 --> 02:43:13,110
It was bait.

2623
02:43:14,030 --> 02:43:15,090
Don't defend.

2624
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:15,850

02:44:18,270 --> 02:44:20,830
Oh my god, that should not have hit me.

2639
02:44:25,370 --> 02:44:25,690
No!

2640
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:27,030
Oh my god, I almost hit him.

2641
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:45,560
Okay, I'm just gonna heal the next time I hit him in a...

2642
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:49,480
If I hit, like, a...

2643
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:53,520
Instead of, like...

2644
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:57,800
Okay, I'm worried he's gonna do it with a fucking goddamn breaststroke again.

2645
02:44:58,480 --> 02:44:58,840
No!

2646
02:45:01,730 --> 02:45:02,690

02:46:16,920 --> 02:46:18,440
There's so many things going on with me!

2671
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:20,760
Nice.

2672
02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:26,160
Okay.

2673
02:46:27,160 --> 02:46:28,620
I just have to be next to him when he does that.

2674
02:46:29,260 --> 02:46:30,560
So I can grab a hit.

2675
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:33,460
Oh!

2676
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:34,740
I'm lucky.

2677
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:35,920
I think I didn't heal here.

2678
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:36,920
Nice.

2679
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:40,840
And then it's just basketball.

2680
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:41,920
Dodge the boss!

2681
02:46:48,830 --> 02:46:49,270
Okay.

2682
02:46:50,710 --> 02:46:51,990
Are you serious?

2683
02:46:52,910 --> 02:46:52,910
Nice.

2684
02:46:54,510 --> 02:46:55,450
Oh, first try!

2685
02:46:57,390 --> 02:46:58,650
Okay, this is pretty easy.

2686
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:00,190
That's right.

2687
02:47:00,330 --> 02:47:01,390
Fuck off.

2688
02:47:02,170 --> 02:47:03,150
Get out of here.

2689
02:47:05,050 --> 02:47:06,490
I'm the baller now.

2690
02:47:10,310 --> 02:47:11,230
What's this?

2691
02:47:11,390 --> 02:47:17,330
Unique charm bestowed by the king of Holonice to his most loyal not scratched and dirty, but still.

2692
02:47:17,810 --> 02:47:42,930
Causes a bear to evoke admit a heroic what the fuck does that do what does it mean when I get a heroic odor like what does that even mean I just get like a fart aura it just makes me stinky what's the point of that

2693
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:51,820
look Doki you're gonna get aura okay that's the point

2694
02:47:55,180 --> 02:47:57,400
You just don't understand.

2695
02:47:57,640 --> 02:47:58,860
It's all about the aura.

2696
02:48:00,700 --> 02:48:02,760
It's what the kids call aura.

2697
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:07,220
Okay, what's down there, though?

2698
02:48:11,150 --> 02:48:12,270
I'm curious.

2699
02:48:13,210 --> 02:48:14,070
Oh, it's just spikes.

2700
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:16,130
But there is money here.

2701
02:48:16,490 --> 02:48:17,530
And money is always good.

2702
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:21,070
Oh, there's more money.

2703
02:48:25,080 --> 02:48:25,420
Okay.

2704
02:48:26,980 --> 02:48:27,460
Nice.

2705
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:30,680
No, what do you think of the game so far?

2706
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:31,640
Are you having fun?

2707
02:48:31,820 --> 02:48:32,120
Yeah.

2708
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:33,340
I like the boss fights.

2709
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:34,540
The boss fights are fun.

2710
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:36,500
Do I go down or up, chat?

2711
02:48:36,840 --> 02:48:37,460
I can't tell.

2712
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:40,020
I legitimately can't tell.

2713
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:44,940
Yeah we farm the aura from that boss.

2714
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:51,460
Down looks more and more scary for some reason.

2715
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:54,720
Down is looking very ominous right now.

2716
02:48:58,660 --> 02:49:00,000
Oh, hey, there's a tree again.

2717
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:02,340
I can't do anything with this tree.

2718
02:49:05,320 --> 02:49:06,660
Up if you want the bed.

2719
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:07,680
Oh, my God.

2720
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:09,120
Give me a sec.

2721
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:10,460
I gotta go back up.

2722
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:13,160
I gotta go get the bench.

2723
02:49:18,270 --> 02:49:18,950
Oh, shit.

2724
02:49:19,150 --> 02:49:19,390
Okay.

2725
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:20,710
I know what.

2726
02:49:21,390 --> 02:49:22,430
Actually, what the fuck?

2727
02:49:22,510 --> 02:49:24,150
Wait, how do I get back up?

2728
02:49:25,590 --> 02:49:26,190
Don't you...

2729
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:26,950
I don't know.

2730
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:27,790
That's what I'm saying.

2731
02:49:29,330 --> 02:49:29,970
and down?

2732
02:49:30,910 --> 02:49:32,250
Wait, I can't go back up.

2733
02:49:33,810 --> 02:49:37,450
Wait, how do I... Oh, okay, wait, wait, okay, I figured it out.

2734
02:49:39,430 --> 02:49:39,830
Okay.

2735
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:47,020
Okay, that's how you go back up.

2736
02:49:47,780 --> 02:49:50,380
Okay, we're gonna grab the bench first before we do this.

2737
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:54,180
Alright.

2738
02:49:57,160 --> 02:49:57,680
Alright.

2739
02:49:58,780 --> 02:50:01,900

Okay, goodbye, sir.

2744
02:50:41,720 --> 02:50:43,260
I do not care about you.

2745
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:49,820
Okay, so there's a bench here.

2746
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:51,860
Where the fuck is this bench?

2747
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:52,720
That was promised.

2748
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:59,080
Let me just kill some of the civilians real quick.

2749
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:02,680
No!

2750
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:11,480
Bench is right, not left?

2751
02:51:11,780 --> 02:51:13,260

Oh my god, I fell into him.

2756
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:38,140
Wait, he does two damage?

2757
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:41,200
Okay, maybe not.

2758
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:41,820
Maybe.

2759
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:48,040
Okay, but I could get so much money, though.

2760
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:52,820
How much was it?

2761
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:53,800
Oh, it was just $50.

2762
02:52:54,160 --> 02:52:54,820
Okay, never mind.

2763
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:55,740
It was not worth it.

2764
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:57,840
It was not worth it.

2765
02:52:58,520 --> 02:52:59,540
I just noticed.

2766
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:01,080
Guys, it was not worth it.

2767
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:02,060
I only got $50.

2768
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:05,160
I'm just gonna kill the civilian.

2769
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:10,500
Okay, there's a sag area here soon.

2770
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:12,100
That's over there.

2771
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:15,360
Wait, what the fuck?

2772
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:17,120
Wait, what the fuck?

2773
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:19,880
Wait, what the fuck?

2774
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:21,500
Are you fucking kidding me?

2775
02:53:21,540 --> 02:53:22,440
They could just do that?

2776
02:53:22,940 --> 02:53:24,040
They broke the bench?

2777
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:25,180
What?

2778
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,340

2782
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:05,820
Don't forget to equip your new gamer aura at the bench.

2783
02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:09,640
Also, to try and equip more charms past your charm slot for the hidden mechanic.

2784
02:54:09,900 --> 02:54:11,120
Wait, what is the hidden mechanic?

2785
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:16,080
The stack inflation.

2786
02:54:17,160 --> 02:54:17,740
What was it?

2787
02:54:17,800 --> 02:54:18,500
Is it this one?

2788
02:54:21,380 --> 02:54:23,340
It won't let me equip it.

2789
02:54:26,260 --> 02:54:28,120
Alright, I want to see what this is.

2790
02:54:36,700 --> 02:54:39,400
So how do I throw away items?

2791
02:54:44,630 --> 02:54:47,570
So guys, how do you throw away items?

2792
02:54:50,330 --> 02:54:53,870
Oh, I have to...

2793
02:54:53,870 --> 02:54:56,610
Oh, okay, so I have to equip it past the slot.

2794
02:54:56,810 --> 02:54:57,930
Alright, what's the hidden mechanic?

2795
02:54:59,270 --> 02:55:00,730
It just gives me a purple.

2796
02:55:01,290 --> 02:55:02,370
What does that mean?

2797
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:04,130
That's it.

2798
02:55:08,540 --> 02:55:09,060
Alright.

2799
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:09,460
Alright.

2800
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:11,480
The aura farm is...

2801
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:12,800
Okay, guys, do I...

2802
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:14,500
Wait, is this still the rich area?

2803
02:55:14,700 --> 02:55:15,200
Yeah, it is.

2804
02:55:15,580 --> 02:55:17,860
Okay, do I go back to the sewer area?

2805
02:55:20,700 --> 02:55:22,940
Oh, we have to keep spamming it?

2806
02:55:23,080 --> 02:55:23,440
Okay.

2807
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:24,900
I didn't know that.

2808
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:28,400
I could do that.

2809
02:55:33,800 --> 02:55:34,280
Okay.

2810
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:36,420
I gotta do it, like, three times?

2811
02:55:36,620 --> 02:55:36,920
Okay.

2812
02:55:49,880 --> 02:55:50,360
Overtime.

2813
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:53,260
Guys, did I...

2814
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:55,700
It feels like I broke the game.

2815
02:55:58,700 --> 02:56:00,640
What happens when I'm overcharged?

2816
02:56:02,500 --> 02:56:03,560
Doesn't look too bad.

2817
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:07,220
Oh, the damage.

2818
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:08,220
Okay, yeah, no.

2819
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:09,420
That's pretty bad.

2820
02:56:09,740 --> 02:56:11,680
I don't want to get double damage.

2821
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:14,300
Things happen.

2822
02:56:14,440 --> 02:56:15,240
No, that's okay.

2823
02:56:15,820 --> 02:56:16,420
No, that's alright.

2824
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:16,860
Okay, guys.

2825
02:56:16,940 --> 02:56:19,100
Do we go back down or do we stay in here?

2826
02:56:21,640 --> 02:56:22,080
Smile.

2827
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:23,380
Don't fucking out.

2828
02:56:23,400 --> 02:56:56,410
yeah you knew what was gonna happen who spoiled it it was gonna happen I was gonna find out eventually guys in one second I was gonna find out literally one second okay we'll go down oh go left to open the door and connect the two has.

2829
02:56:56,610 --> 02:56:58,130
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

2830
02:57:00,890 --> 02:57:02,630
We will have fun for one.

2831
02:57:02,750 --> 02:57:06,150
Yeah, but that means we will have fun for one second.

2832
02:57:09,230 --> 02:57:11,790
It's not even worth it.

2833
02:57:16,330 --> 02:57:22,630
Snitches get stitches but also in exchange for more damage, you get to equip extra charms for more powerful builds and not just a troll.

2834
02:57:22,750 --> 02:57:23,730
Now, thank you for the super chat.

2835
02:57:23,830 --> 02:57:24,050
Thank you.

2836
02:57:24,130 --> 02:57:24,730
Thank you.

2837
02:57:24,830 --> 02:57:25,350
No, it's alright.

2838
02:57:25,450 --> 02:57:28,650
I like that it's one damage that they do to me.

2839
02:57:30,410 --> 02:57:33,910
I like having them do only one damage instead of double.

2840
02:57:34,970 --> 02:57:37,030
That seems a lot of fun in general.

2841
02:57:40,930 --> 02:57:42,070
Okay, it's down here.

2842
02:57:45,130 --> 02:57:45,830
Alright, nice.

2843
02:57:46,050 --> 02:57:47,270
Okay, I connected the two halves.

2844
02:57:48,830 --> 02:57:49,390
That's right.

2845
02:57:49,990 --> 02:57:50,690
That's right.

2846
02:57:50,970 --> 02:57:53,510
I invited a Polterrier into it.

2847
02:57:53,610 --> 02:57:55,330
The bullet bourgeoisie.

2848
02:57:55,930 --> 02:57:57,110
What you gotta do about that?

2849
02:57:58,150 --> 02:57:59,190
Viva de France!

2850
02:58:00,510 --> 02:58:01,810
That's right, you rich bugs.

2851
02:58:02,110 --> 02:58:03,310
Can't stay there forever.

2852
02:58:11,750 --> 02:58:13,710
I was pointing him to go wherever and you'll find stuff to do.

2853
02:58:13,870 --> 02:58:15,390
You have access to almost the entire map.

2854
02:58:15,850 --> 02:58:16,570
Explore and have fun.

2855
02:58:16,670 --> 02:58:17,450
Thank you for the super chat.

2856
02:58:17,690 --> 02:58:17,810
Thank you.

2857
02:58:18,190 --> 02:58:18,910
Thank you.

2858
02:58:18,910 --> 02:58:20,370
Yeah, it's still...

2859
02:58:20,370 --> 02:58:23,110
I think again, it's still for the super chat.

2860
02:58:24,130 --> 02:58:24,970
What the fuck?

2861
02:58:25,510 --> 02:58:27,150
Polterriot versus the bourgeoisie.

2862
02:58:27,210 --> 02:58:27,510
Bravo!

2863
02:58:30,290 --> 02:58:32,150
I connected the two cities together.

2864
02:58:32,390 --> 02:58:33,330
They didn't want it.

2865
02:58:33,690 --> 02:58:35,690
But it don't matter what they think.

2866
02:58:38,690 --> 02:58:38,890
Alright.

2867
02:58:39,390 --> 02:58:40,570
We go this way now.

2868
02:58:41,910 --> 02:58:43,490
This place looks very dangerous.

2869
02:58:44,950 --> 02:58:46,350
It looks very ominous.

2870
02:58:50,300 --> 02:58:51,320
Oh my god.

2871
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:51,660
Okay.

2872
02:58:52,020 --> 02:58:53,300
I was like, what's below me?

2873
02:58:53,380 --> 02:58:54,040
Oh, okay.

2874
02:58:54,300 --> 02:58:54,740
Death.

2875
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:01,400
I wonder what's below me right now.

2876
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:02,120
Do you think it's...

2877
02:59:02,140 --> 02:59:03,060
safe for me?

2878
02:59:07,460 --> 02:59:10,280
Just actual death down there.

2879
02:59:14,740 --> 02:59:16,120
It's over here, though.

2880
02:59:17,060 --> 02:59:17,260
Okay.

2881
02:59:17,940 --> 02:59:18,760
What is that?

2882
02:59:18,820 --> 02:59:19,260
Oh, money.

2883
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:21,240
Someone's secret stash.

2884
02:59:23,560 --> 02:59:27,260
Oh, I thought there'd be a secret there.

2885
02:59:27,640 --> 02:59:28,340
God damn it.

2886
02:59:33,860 --> 02:59:34,300
Come on.

2887
02:59:34,740 --> 02:59:35,560
God damn it.

2888
02:59:36,280 --> 02:59:36,860
Oh, my God.

2889
02:59:37,060 --> 02:59:37,320
Fuck.

2890
02:59:37,840 --> 02:59:38,220
Oh, hey.

2891
02:59:38,400 --> 02:59:38,840
Speed run.

2892
02:59:39,700 --> 02:59:41,600
That is intentional.

2893
02:59:48,150 --> 02:59:49,730
There's nothing here.

2894
02:59:52,270 --> 02:59:54,070
You'd think there'd be something down there.

2895
02:59:55,870 --> 02:59:56,490
What's down here?

2896
02:59:58,370 --> 02:59:59,130
What the fuck?

2897
03:00:00,990 --> 03:00:02,290
Oh my gosh, no map.

2898
03:00:03,370 --> 03:00:03,550
Nope.

2899
03:00:04,850 --> 03:00:07,390
I'm making them some for a side of some kind of pass.

2900
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:09,130
Fuck am I.

2901
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:14,160
Where the fuck am I?

2902
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:17,920
Yeah, but there's a hole here.

2903
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:22,340
Huh?

2904
03:00:24,080 --> 03:00:25,440
Pull left.

2905
03:00:27,380 --> 03:00:28,640
Before I go?

2906
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:30,760
Hello?

2907
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:34,380
Get down, I go.

2908
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:37,260
Get over here.

2909
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:38,900
Oh, shit, JK!

2910
03:00:39,260 --> 03:00:41,480
He's like, you told me to get that over here.

2911
03:00:42,060 --> 03:00:43,480
Jesus Christ!

2912
03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:45,720
What is this guy's range?

2913
03:00:49,360 --> 03:00:50,520
Oh my god!

2914
03:00:51,620 --> 03:00:53,220
That guy's range was insane.

2915
03:00:53,380 --> 03:00:54,420
Wait, what's down over here?

2916
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:02,960
Okay, I need a...

2917
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:04,020
Yeah, far more solos.

2918
03:01:05,660 --> 03:01:07,120
Okay, that's enough solos.

2919
03:01:07,540 --> 03:01:08,300
That should be enough.

2920
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:12,660
Alright, nice.

2921
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:17,960
Okay, I can hit it, and then he go back.

2922
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:22,360
Yeah, because He has like...

2923
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:22,940
Okay, nice.

2924
03:01:23,560 --> 03:01:24,660
But I'm gonna check time.

2925
03:01:27,720 --> 03:01:29,800
Okay, now I know how to fight these guys.

2926
03:01:32,180 --> 03:01:32,200
Yeah.

2927
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:34,160
Yeah.

2928
03:01:38,140 --> 03:01:40,300
I hear like the explodey guys.

2929
03:01:40,780 --> 03:01:40,940
Dude.

2930
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:46,280
I hear the explodey guys near me.

2931
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:50,520
I know they're here.

2932
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:52,900
What the fuck is that?

2933
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:55,220
What?

2934
03:01:56,320 --> 03:01:57,360
It's just orange ghoul.

2935
03:01:58,360 --> 03:01:59,040
Are those bees?

2936
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:00,600
Oh, it's these guys.

2937
03:02:01,820 --> 03:02:02,280
Oh!

2938
03:02:04,360 --> 03:02:05,160
Oh my gosh.

2939
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:07,620
Okay, these guys are weak as hell though.

2940
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:11,180
Does that mean the next boss is like themed around these guys?

2941
03:02:16,140 --> 03:02:16,860
Oh, wait.

2942
03:02:16,920 --> 03:02:18,120
They spit those too.

2943
03:02:21,820 --> 03:02:22,280
They...

2944
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:24,060
Oh, god damn it!

2945
03:02:25,500 --> 03:02:26,800
Fuck this, I'm Pogo-ing.

2946
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:27,240
No!

2947
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:29,180
I missed my Pogo.

2948
03:02:32,520 --> 03:02:33,200
What?

2949
03:02:34,180 --> 03:02:34,600
Meryl?

2950
03:02:35,640 --> 03:02:37,820
Oh, no, it's that girl.

2951
03:02:39,080 --> 03:02:39,600
It's cloth.

2952
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:40,700
My friend.

2953
03:02:41,460 --> 03:02:42,880
You tell with all these beasts?

2954
03:02:43,700 --> 03:02:44,760
I'm chain of sea.

2955
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:46,380
I was hiding.

2956
03:02:46,980 --> 03:02:49,240
Those ghastly things chased me.

2957
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:51,080
And I ran.

2958
03:02:51,780 --> 03:02:52,720
I hadn't come along.

2959
03:02:53,280 --> 03:02:55,480
Who knows if I ever have survived.

2960
03:02:55,500 --> 03:03:25,860

2962
03:03:26,940 --> 03:03:28,060
Are you not gonna help me?

2963
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:32,380
Why won't you help me?

2964
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,480
I literally gave you, like...

2965
03:03:35,480 --> 03:03:37,620
I gave you motivation.

2966
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:38,520
Help me.

2967
03:03:39,380 --> 03:03:40,460
Help me fight them.

2968
03:03:41,900 --> 03:03:42,920
Like, he's literally...

2969
03:03:42,920 --> 03:03:43,860
Oh, my god.

2970
03:03:48,020 --> 03:03:49,500
Wait, are these, like...

2971
03:03:53,240 --> 03:03:54,600
Like, what the fuck?

2972
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:55,480
Help me fight them.

2973
03:03:55,500 --> 03:03:56,440
these guys.

2974
03:03:58,600 --> 03:03:59,340
I'll meet her again.

2975
03:03:59,780 --> 03:04:00,020
Nice.

2976
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:01,820
She better help me.

2977
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:03,800
What's this?

2978
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:04,840
Oh, nice.

2979
03:04:04,980 --> 03:04:05,580
I can upgrade.

2980
03:04:07,900 --> 03:04:08,620
That's good.

2981
03:04:09,080 --> 03:04:10,080
I got upgrades now.

2982
03:04:11,080 --> 03:04:11,280
Fucking new.

2983
03:04:11,340 --> 03:04:12,460
Oh, I can shoot it.

2984
03:04:12,540 --> 03:04:12,800
Wait.

2985
03:04:13,080 --> 03:04:13,320
Fuck.

2986
03:04:13,400 --> 03:04:14,380
I should have done that before.

2987
03:04:18,700 --> 03:04:19,260
Oh, no.

2988
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:19,860
I knew that before.

2989
03:04:20,120 --> 03:04:21,000
Okay, now I get to have...

2990
03:04:21,600 --> 03:04:22,640
Oh, never mind.

2991
03:04:22,700 --> 03:04:24,060
That didn't work the second time.

2992
03:04:27,240 --> 03:04:28,200
Never mind.

2993
03:04:28,340 --> 03:04:29,200
It didn't work.

2994
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:31,460
I thought I was so clever.

2995
03:04:35,670 --> 03:04:37,690
I was like, look, I did it.

2996
03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:42,980
Does this have a map?

2997
03:04:43,100 --> 03:04:43,640
No, it doesn't.

2998
03:04:43,700 --> 03:04:44,760
God damn, of course it doesn't.

2999
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:45,980
Nothing ever has a map.

3000
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:50,000
They never have a map.

3001
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:53,840
That's me.

3002
03:04:57,650 --> 03:04:58,130
Alright.

3003
03:04:58,430 --> 03:04:59,730
It does, but you have to be free.

3004
03:05:03,570 --> 03:05:05,090
Am I done with that area?

3005
03:05:05,510 --> 03:05:09,470
I can't tell because like I can't see anything.

3006
03:05:13,590 --> 03:05:16,410
My GP, I don't have signal down here.

3007
03:05:16,730 --> 03:05:17,470
So I can't tell.

3008
03:05:22,850 --> 03:05:23,970
Ancient Basin.

3009
03:05:25,910 --> 03:05:27,410
This is suck when you just don't have signal.

3010
03:05:27,510 --> 03:05:28,390
Oh my god, thank god.

3011
03:05:28,590 --> 03:05:29,230
At least you're here.

3012
03:05:32,210 --> 03:05:34,010
Well, Gavin, he's on.

3013
03:05:35,510 --> 03:05:37,310
the weight of the kingdom above.

3014
03:05:38,190 --> 03:05:39,830
It's a heavy thing, all right.

3015
03:05:40,870 --> 03:05:43,010
I reckon not many reach these depths.

3016
03:05:43,450 --> 03:05:47,090
We pioneers, you and I, at least in recent history.

3017
03:05:48,330 --> 03:05:48,870
Oh, nice.

3018
03:05:49,010 --> 03:05:49,790
Yeah, I'll take a map.

3019
03:05:50,010 --> 03:05:50,370
Thank you.

3020
03:05:51,230 --> 03:05:51,710
Thank you.

3021
03:05:52,090 --> 03:05:54,730
I'm literally holding up your GDP right now.

3022
03:05:56,270 --> 03:05:59,470
Alright, there is a bench to the left side.

3023
03:05:59,610 --> 03:06:00,370
We're gonna grab that.

3024
03:06:01,830 --> 03:06:02,830
There's something I wanted.

3025
03:06:02,950 --> 03:06:03,250
Oh, yeah.

3026
03:06:03,290 --> 03:06:05,490

I'll do it when I find the MTR.

3030
03:06:45,370 --> 03:06:46,510
Maybe it's over here.

3031
03:06:48,150 --> 03:06:49,670
It's just too far right now.

3032
03:06:55,890 --> 03:06:58,390
I need to find the MTR for this area.

3033
03:07:01,650 --> 03:07:03,630
No, MTR at a metro station.

3034
03:07:04,390 --> 03:07:05,370
Wait, how do I...

3035
03:07:05,370 --> 03:07:06,650
How come I can't do this?

3036
03:07:09,490 --> 03:07:10,830
The stag station.

3037
03:07:14,820 --> 03:07:16,940
I can't get to the palace grounds.

3038
03:07:25,270 --> 03:07:27,150
Alright, absorb the souls.

3039
03:07:27,490 --> 03:07:28,250
Wait, what's this?

3040
03:07:29,250 --> 03:07:31,570
Our beings, these words are for you alone.

3041
03:07:32,030 --> 03:07:33,530
Our pure vessel has ascended.

3042
03:07:33,910 --> 03:07:36,950
Beyond lies only the refuse and regret of its creation.

3043
03:07:37,370 --> 03:07:39,190
We shall center that place no longer.

3044
03:07:39,810 --> 03:07:39,970
Huh?

3045
03:07:40,850 --> 03:07:41,250
Lore!

3046
03:07:42,410 --> 03:07:45,470
Oh, I need double trap, uh, double jump.

3047
03:07:46,450 --> 03:07:48,410
Okay, so I can't head there yet.

3048
03:07:49,090 --> 03:07:51,290
Am I supposed to be down here?

3049
03:07:52,430 --> 03:07:53,370
Come back later?

3050
03:07:56,090 --> 03:07:58,030
Where do I go to come back later?

3051
03:07:58,210 --> 03:07:59,050
Do I have to go?

3052
03:07:59,530 --> 03:08:01,090
Am I supposed to be in this area?

3053
03:08:02,150 --> 03:08:02,850
Can't tell.

3054
03:08:05,690 --> 03:08:06,390
No, you're not?

3055
03:08:06,550 --> 03:08:07,310
Okay, let's leave.

3056
03:08:07,830 --> 03:08:09,090
Alright, time to leave.

3057
03:08:10,030 --> 03:08:10,290
Ow.

3058
03:08:10,850 --> 03:08:11,850
Gotta fuck this guy.

3059
03:08:13,190 --> 03:08:14,450
Okay, now we leave.

3060
03:08:14,910 --> 03:08:16,110
Alright, how do I leave?

3061
03:08:18,970 --> 03:08:20,150
It's this way.

3062
03:08:23,110 --> 03:08:24,590
I don't want to deal with this guy.

3063
03:08:30,250 --> 03:08:30,890
Crystal mines.

3064
03:08:31,150 --> 03:08:32,470
Where the fuck is that?

3065
03:08:36,330 --> 03:08:38,670
Guys, I don't know where the crystal mines.

3066
03:08:38,830 --> 03:08:40,490
How do I get to the crystal mines?

3067
03:08:46,110 --> 03:08:46,850
Oh, wait.

3068
03:08:47,050 --> 03:08:48,390
Okay, let me...

3069
03:08:52,790 --> 03:08:53,750
From here...

3070
03:08:54,330 --> 03:08:54,770
tears.

3071
03:08:56,150 --> 03:08:57,390
Oh, the right of crossroads?

3072
03:08:57,590 --> 03:08:59,010
Okay, grab that.

3073
03:09:02,810 --> 03:09:03,770
I get out of here.

3074
03:09:04,050 --> 03:09:05,130
I need to take your stash.

3075
03:09:05,890 --> 03:09:07,450
Guarding your stash of money.

3076
03:09:07,750 --> 03:09:08,530
You're so greedy.

3077
03:09:09,690 --> 03:09:12,470
Can't believe it, and you're not gonna share with me?

3078
03:09:14,570 --> 03:09:15,450
It's this way.

3079
03:09:15,530 --> 03:09:16,850
Okay, we gotta go this way.

3080
03:09:22,710 --> 03:09:23,150
Alright.

3081
03:09:23,370 --> 03:09:23,510
Alright.

3082
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:26,490
Oh my god, okay.

3083
03:09:27,290 --> 03:09:30,150
Can't believe I have to go all the way back.

3084
03:09:30,490 --> 03:09:30,790
Oh!

3085
03:09:33,270 --> 03:09:34,950
It's so far!

3086
03:09:37,050 --> 03:09:37,730
Parkour!

3087
03:09:40,250 --> 03:09:40,930
Okay.

3088
03:09:43,350 --> 03:09:43,570
Ow.

3089
03:09:48,260 --> 03:09:50,380
I gotta make sure I don't die from this.

3090
03:09:52,360 --> 03:09:54,140
Gotta do the parkour.

3091
03:09:58,580 --> 03:09:59,260
Parkour.

3092
03:10:04,180 --> 03:10:07,580
Yeah, I'm going all the way back up top so I can upgrade the nail.

3093
03:10:11,900 --> 03:10:13,060
Are you serious?

3094
03:10:13,360 --> 03:10:13,740
Get out of here!

3095
03:10:13,800 --> 03:10:14,340
Get out of here!

3096
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:15,340
You took your lives don't matter!

3097
03:10:16,160 --> 03:10:17,820
We can replace you whenever we want!

3098
03:10:19,580 --> 03:10:21,120
Okay, this way.

3099
03:10:25,190 --> 03:10:26,430
I'm having so much fun, Parkway.

3100
03:10:34,240 --> 03:10:34,640
Alright.

3101
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:39,560
I'm bugging.

3102
03:10:39,580 --> 03:10:40,860
Lives matter.

3103
03:10:41,620 --> 03:10:43,080
Not all bug lives matter.

3104
03:10:45,180 --> 03:10:47,240
I can name like so many...

3105
03:10:47,240 --> 03:10:48,520
That's right, you deserve to drown.

3106
03:10:49,460 --> 03:10:52,620
I can name so many bugs that contribute nothing to society.

3107
03:10:56,870 --> 03:10:57,650
Get this way.

3108
03:10:58,010 --> 03:10:58,790
No real.

3109
03:11:02,430 --> 03:11:04,950
If it matters so much, why would you need...

3110
03:11:04,950 --> 03:11:07,270
Why would you need mosquito spray, huh?

3111
03:11:07,790 --> 03:11:10,930
Why don't you just let the mosquitoes suck your blood?

3112
03:11:11,050 --> 03:11:13,350
They're hardworking single mothers.

3113
03:11:16,290 --> 03:11:21,910
You know the mosquitoes that suck your blood, they're all hardworking single mothers trying to provide for their kids.

3114
03:11:22,330 --> 03:11:23,830
Oh, but you won't let them suck your blood.

3115
03:11:24,370 --> 03:11:25,070
What's wrong with that?

3116
03:11:30,390 --> 03:11:30,910
True.

3117
03:11:35,550 --> 03:11:36,530
That's okay, you're right.

3118
03:11:36,890 --> 03:11:38,730
So not all bug lives matter.

3119
03:11:38,970 --> 03:11:39,730
That's fucking right.

3120
03:11:41,050 --> 03:11:42,210
Let them suck your blood.

3121
03:11:46,130 --> 03:11:48,610
Why are you fucking using mosquito nets, huh?

3122
03:11:50,570 --> 03:11:52,710
Because I need my blood.

3123
03:11:53,010 --> 03:11:54,850
You just want to take a little bit.

3124
03:11:54,970 --> 03:11:56,810
0.1% of your blood.

3125
03:11:57,430 --> 03:12:00,190
I don't want malaria.

3126
03:12:00,630 --> 03:12:02,250
Oh, so you want her to starve?

3127
03:12:04,970 --> 03:12:08,330
Would you love dragoons if we were bugs, don't you?

3128
03:12:09,430 --> 03:12:10,590
No comment.

3129
03:12:11,050 --> 03:12:13,830

3132
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:53,940
It's gonna take fucking forever to fire.

3133
03:12:54,420 --> 03:12:56,020
Where can I farm this, actually?

3134
03:13:00,650 --> 03:13:01,530
Yeah, you're right.

3135
03:13:01,710 --> 03:13:02,810
I have to sell the emblems.

3136
03:13:02,910 --> 03:13:03,930
I'm gonna go sell it.

3137
03:13:04,990 --> 03:13:06,790
I don't think I can farm this.

3138
03:13:07,190 --> 03:13:09,130
Farm it from just tier fighting.

3139
03:13:14,160 --> 03:13:15,220
I'm at 700.

3140
03:13:16,960 --> 03:13:18,380
These guys take that...

3141
03:13:19,720 --> 03:13:22,460
These guys are 10, so I just need to kill 10 of them.

3142
03:13:33,310 --> 03:13:35,450
I'll just sell it from...

3143
03:13:35,450 --> 03:13:35,930
Oh, wait.

3144
03:13:36,330 --> 03:13:36,970
There's a merchant.

3145
03:13:38,590 --> 03:13:40,010
Oh, the merchant's above me.

3146
03:13:41,030 --> 03:13:42,650
Sell it from the merchant, then.

3147
03:13:49,770 --> 03:13:51,030
Alright, take my money.

3148
03:13:51,270 --> 03:13:51,890
Sell me objects.

3149
03:13:52,890 --> 03:13:53,490
Um, am I...

3150
03:13:53,490 --> 03:13:54,930
Can I sell the journal to him?

3151
03:14:02,190 --> 03:14:02,910
Am I...

3152
03:14:02,910 --> 03:14:03,150
Yeah?

3153
03:14:03,350 --> 03:14:03,610
Okay.

3154
03:14:07,050 --> 03:14:08,890
A wonder is journal, eh?

3155
03:14:09,710 --> 03:14:11,530
Although they're common fountains about the kingdom.

3156
03:14:11,990 --> 03:14:14,070
I much enjoyed the deciphering of their text.

3157
03:14:15,110 --> 03:14:15,710
Road together.

3158
03:14:16,370 --> 03:14:17,130
They read together.

3159
03:14:17,290 --> 03:14:18,330
They paint a morbid tale.

3160
03:14:18,870 --> 03:14:22,650
It seems fate wasn't kind to those most who travel within Holiness ruins.

3161
03:14:23,590 --> 03:14:24,550
Alright, now I can afford it.

3162
03:14:25,690 --> 03:14:27,150
No, I will not sell.

3163
03:14:27,190 --> 03:14:27,990
I'm a hoarder.

3164
03:14:31,070 --> 03:14:33,430
I'm hoarding it for Silk Song, too.

3165
03:14:34,710 --> 03:14:35,770
Because this is silk song.

3166
03:14:39,980 --> 03:14:43,000
Don't worry, my money will transfer over in silk song too.

3167
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:45,780
I know, good decision, I know.

3168
03:14:47,220 --> 03:14:47,780
Smart.

3169
03:14:53,450 --> 03:14:53,830
Okay.

3170
03:14:56,690 --> 03:14:58,430
All right, I gotta go to the nail man.

3171
03:14:59,710 --> 03:15:01,170
Take my money nail man.

3172

03:16:56,250 --> 03:16:57,010
Nope, nope, nope.

3184
03:16:57,530 --> 03:17:00,530
Oh, that's as high as I could go.

3185
03:17:00,750 --> 03:17:03,150
Okay, I was gonna say, keep going up!

3186
03:17:04,910 --> 03:17:07,770
But it couldn't keep going up.

3187
03:17:13,620 --> 03:17:14,900
I went this way.

3188
03:17:16,100 --> 03:17:17,580
God damn it, these guys.

3189
03:17:17,920 --> 03:17:18,680
God damn it.

3190
03:17:21,640 --> 03:17:22,660
Get out of here.

3191
03:17:23,500 --> 03:17:24,400
I gotta heal.

3192
03:17:31,380 --> 03:17:34,200
Okay, they said still take only two strikes, though.

3193
03:17:34,820 --> 03:17:36,400
Okay, forgotten crossroads is up here.

3194
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:44,560
Alright.

3195
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:47,380
We gotta go.

3196
03:17:49,280 --> 03:17:49,580
Up.

3197
03:17:52,580 --> 03:17:53,440
Jesus Christ.

3198
03:17:53,700 --> 03:17:54,460
Get out of here!

3199
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:56,300
Get out of here!

3200
03:17:56,500 --> 03:17:58,340
The king doesn't care about you!

3201
03:17:59,160 --> 03:17:59,800
Just work.

3202
03:17:59,920 --> 03:18:01,060
You don't have to go overtime.

3203
03:18:01,180 --> 03:18:01,960
You don't have to try as hard.

3204
03:18:02,480 --> 03:18:03,760
You're never gonna get that promotion.

3205
03:18:05,540 --> 03:18:08,920
Mike, thank you for this, uh, for the one gift of ship, thank you, thank you.

3206
03:18:13,670 --> 03:18:15,850
Wait, there's a stack station over there?

3207
03:18:17,130 --> 03:18:17,810
Why the fuck?

3208
03:18:17,950 --> 03:18:20,190
Oh my god, I should have bought the stack station shit.

3209
03:18:22,030 --> 03:18:23,910
You know what, I need to go to the stack station anyway.

3210
03:18:31,160 --> 03:18:31,560
Alright.

3211
03:18:35,020 --> 03:18:36,460
Oh shit, my map updated?

3212
03:18:38,480 --> 03:18:39,500
See, it all looks the same.

3213
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:40,240
Okay.

3214
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:44,660
I need to buy, yeah, I need to buy the stack station.

3215
03:18:44,820 --> 03:18:45,820
Do I, can I afford it?

3216
03:18:46,680 --> 03:18:49,960
I don't even know if I can afford the stack station pin.

3217
03:18:55,020 --> 03:18:55,300
Okay.

3218
03:19:05,300 --> 03:19:06,100
100 geo?

3219
03:19:06,400 --> 03:19:06,920
Okay, nice.

3220
03:19:08,660 --> 03:19:09,060
Cocoon.

3221
03:19:09,280 --> 03:19:10,120
Oh, there it is.

3222
03:19:11,880 --> 03:19:12,980
I actually needed that.

3223
03:19:13,220 --> 03:19:14,100
Is there anything else here?

3224
03:19:14,740 --> 03:19:15,680
No, it's just markers.

3225
03:19:16,500 --> 03:19:18,120
Yeah, we don't need the hot spring or anything.

3226
03:19:19,220 --> 03:19:19,540
Alright.

3227
03:19:20,180 --> 03:19:21,100
We just gotta go down.

3228
03:19:22,240 --> 03:19:26,760
Finally, I missed the Crossroads Stag Station somewhere.

3229
03:19:27,180 --> 03:19:29,300
But, like, it didn't even show on the map.

3230
03:19:30,840 --> 03:19:31,320
Nevi!

3231
03:19:31,740 --> 03:19:32,800
Thank you for the raid!

3232
03:19:33,220 --> 03:19:34,820
I saw you also play Hollow Knight!

3233
03:19:35,720 --> 03:19:37,300
I play Hollow Knight, too!

3234
03:19:38,600 --> 03:19:40,800
The never-ending Hollow Knight raid.

3235
03:19:40,880 --> 03:19:43,880
What if I just raid another YouTuber that's also playing Hollow Knight?

3236
03:19:45,820 --> 03:19:48,780
We're all just gonna watch Hollow Knight for the rest of our lives.

3237
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:49,680
Sorry, I'm in.

3238
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:51,340
I'm playing Silk Star right now, guys.

3239
03:19:52,780 --> 03:19:55,320
Guys, I got early access to silk sawing.

3240
03:19:55,400 --> 03:19:56,180
Look at that.

3241
03:19:58,260 --> 03:20:00,080
Wait a second.

3242
03:20:02,180 --> 03:20:02,820
Yeah, guys.

3243
03:20:02,920 --> 03:20:04,060

3244
03:20:06,140 --> 03:20:07,620
My Jane silk sawing.

3245
03:20:08,460 --> 03:20:12,480
Okay, where the fuck is the stack station on this area?

3246
03:20:15,280 --> 03:20:18,060
Guys, okay, where's the stack station for this area?

3247
03:20:19,160 --> 03:20:21,440
Wait, no, no, spoilers!

3248
03:20:24,700 --> 03:20:26,000
What the fuck is this mod?

3249
03:20:26,140 --> 03:20:28,360
It's called Getting Silk Song Early Axes.

3250
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:29,140
That's the mod.

3251
03:20:30,640 --> 03:20:31,120
Down?

3252
03:20:32,880 --> 03:20:33,740

Oh, that's the...

3257
03:20:45,330 --> 03:20:46,870
It's about her past.

3258
03:20:46,990 --> 03:20:48,170
That's why she's tied me.

3259

Another one in foster care.

3270
03:21:53,500 --> 03:21:54,460
My foster care.

3271
03:21:55,060 --> 03:21:55,660
Alright, this way.

03:22:05,890 --> 03:22:06,970
Just for the fun of it.

3275
03:22:07,030 --> 03:22:08,530
I don't even need to kill you.

3276
03:22:10,510 --> 03:22:10,830
Alright.

3277
03:22:13,490 --> 03:22:14,290

3278
03:22:14,770 --> 03:22:17,990
God damn it, I'll never find Silk So, I mean, I'll never find the Stag.

3279
03:22:19,530 --> 03:22:20,330
It's down.

3280
03:22:21,590 --> 03:22:22,330
Hello, this room.

Use those old lines?

3290
03:22:41,050 --> 03:22:41,410
Pathetic.

3291
03:22:41,870 --> 03:22:44,710
A real warrior carries himself to combat.

3292
03:22:45,430 --> 03:22:47,610
He has no need for such convenience.

3293
03:22:49,010 --> 03:22:49,230
Alright.

3294
03:22:49,690 --> 03:22:51,090
God, so mysterious.

3295
03:22:55,590 --> 03:22:57,010
Now thank you for the super chat.

Thank you.

3298
03:22:58,030 --> 03:23:00,330
My dad is team cherry and sent Doki to early access.

3299
03:23:00,710 --> 03:23:05,350
He said he'll only fully release it if she gets a true ending.

3300
03:23:05,890 --> 03:23:08,550
song today for another 20 years.

3301
03:23:11,970 --> 03:23:13,430
That guy doesn't like public transport.

3302
03:23:13,570 --> 03:23:14,410
What's wrong with him?

3303
03:23:15,610 --> 03:23:16,530
Does he hate?

3304
03:23:17,050 --> 03:23:18,770
Does he hate children?

3305
03:23:19,730 --> 03:23:20,550
I'd like that.

3306
03:23:20,650 --> 03:23:21,590
I'd like him.

3307
03:23:23,770 --> 03:23:24,710
Oh, what the fuck?

3308
03:23:24,910 --> 03:23:26,210
He gave that sky a shield.

3309
03:23:27,170 --> 03:23:27,970
Oh my god.

3310
03:23:29,830 --> 03:23:30,470
My man.

3311
03:23:35,320 --> 03:23:36,540
He hates the people.

3312
03:23:37,800 --> 03:23:38,600
What's over here?

3313
03:23:39,920 --> 03:23:41,300
I've never been to this area.

3314
03:23:41,880 --> 03:23:42,160
What's that?

3315
03:23:42,840 --> 03:23:43,900
What is that side?

3316
03:23:49,160 --> 03:23:49,500
Oh!

3317
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:54,260
The upper entrance will be better.

3318
03:23:54,460 --> 03:23:55,340
Okay, we'll get there.

3319
03:23:56,200 --> 03:23:57,220
Go ahead there.

3320
03:24:01,930 --> 03:24:03,430
Alright, it's this way.

3321
03:24:08,540 --> 03:24:11,040
We'll go back to the one we found earlier.

3322
03:24:12,980 --> 03:24:13,620
This one?

3323
03:24:13,780 --> 03:24:14,400
Was this the one?

3324
03:24:14,900 --> 03:24:15,680
Or the toll booth?

3325
03:24:16,380 --> 03:24:16,900

Lawful good.

3330
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:57,060
I'm a lawful good person.

3331
03:25:00,180 --> 03:25:01,720
How do I get over there?

3332
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:04,980
Oh, I hit the face only.

3333
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:08,540
Oh, okay.

3334
03:25:08,580 --> 03:25:08,960

3335
03:25:09,460 --> 03:25:10,780
I can't smack his ass.

3336
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:12,640
He didn't consent.

3337
03:25:16,860 --> 03:25:17,880
It's like no ass smack.

3338
03:25:27,620 --> 03:25:28,920
Oh, it's her!

3339
03:25:30,280 --> 03:25:31,440

03:25:52,700 --> 03:25:55,120
That was like, hey friend Hey friend!

3346
03:25:59,380 --> 03:26:00,360
Oh, there's a bench.

3347
03:26:01,380 --> 03:26:01,980
Where's my bed?

3348
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:02,740
Oh, there it is.

3349
03:26:03,100 --> 03:26:03,980

Thank you.

3354
03:26:13,180 --> 03:26:14,420
Don't believe her lies.

3355
03:26:14,580 --> 03:26:17,820
She wouldn't even love us if we were bugs.

3356
03:26:18,260 --> 03:26:19,940
Yeah, but you're not bugs.

3357
03:26:20,420 --> 03:26:21,540
Count your blessings.

3358
03:26:25,360 --> 03:26:26,480
Code name.

3359
03:26:26,840 --> 03:26:27,960
Welcome to tomato fire.

03:26:28,240 --> 03:26:29,080
Welcome, welcome.

03:26:29,380 --> 03:26:34,120
You should be happy, you're not disgusting bug.

3362
03:26:38,560 --> 03:26:39,980
Alright, we go here.

3363
03:26:44,780 --> 03:26:46,660
I already used the bench.

3364
03:26:50,740 --> 03:26:52,140
What the fuck does this?

3365
03:26:52,240 --> 03:26:53,160
Okay, oh yeah, it does.

3366
03:26:53,300 --> 03:26:54,680
Okay, I was gonna say, does it disappear?

3367
03:26:55,200 --> 03:26:55,960
That shit's OP.

3368
03:26:58,700 --> 03:27:00,700
Bugs aren't disgusting.

3369
03:27:01,960 --> 03:27:03,040
Are you an ant?

3370
03:27:03,620 --> 03:27:03,820
Are you?

3371
03:27:08,820 --> 03:27:12,680
Who paid you to say that in my chat?

3372
03:27:17,570 --> 03:27:18,430
Oh, hey, a net is...

3373
03:27:18,430 --> 03:27:19,870
Oh, it's blocked.

3374
03:27:21,370 --> 03:27:22,130
I gotta go this way.

3375
03:27:22,790 --> 03:27:24,230
What if they are?

3376
03:27:25,830 --> 03:27:27,970
This is not safe space for ants.

3377
03:27:33,540 --> 03:27:33,920
Okay.

3378
03:27:35,120 --> 03:27:37,020
There's some areas a little annoying.

3379
03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:39,500
but it's not as annoying as the worms.

3380
03:27:48,350 --> 03:27:49,630
We could be dragon blasts.

3381
03:27:49,710 --> 03:27:51,330
We could change for you.

3382
03:27:51,950 --> 03:27:53,050
Alright, I'll pay for the surgery.

3383
03:27:58,450 --> 03:27:59,250
Alright, we go this way.

3384
03:28:03,930 --> 03:28:05,570
Okay, this is definitely a boss fight.

3385
03:28:06,270 --> 03:28:07,430
Like, where am I?

3386
03:28:07,790 --> 03:28:09,170
Am I, like, in a cemetery?

3387
03:28:10,370 --> 03:28:12,390
How do I fuck that get into the cemetery?

3388
03:28:13,430 --> 03:28:15,610
Curse your dose you turn against the king.

3389
03:28:16,190 --> 03:28:17,650
How did I get here?

3390
03:28:17,850 --> 03:28:18,910
How was it in the mine?

3391
03:28:20,310 --> 03:28:22,030
I yearned for it.

3392
03:28:29,710 --> 03:28:30,830
Oh, I didn't have enough souls.

3393
03:28:39,030 --> 03:28:39,490
Oh.

3394
03:28:40,130 --> 03:28:40,650
Aliens?

3395
03:28:44,700 --> 03:28:46,100
Right after the beast's vessel.

3396
03:28:46,300 --> 03:28:47,580
The dream really is sleeping.

3397
03:28:48,940 --> 03:28:52,420
Monomon, the teacher, in her archive, surrounded by fog and mist.

3398
03:28:52,920 --> 03:28:54,160
Lorian, the watcher.

3399
03:28:54,240 --> 03:28:57,760
In his spy, I looked over the bug aliens.

3400
03:28:59,480 --> 03:29:00,600
Am I in Area 51?

3401
03:29:01,440 --> 03:29:05,000
Herod the beast in her den amidst a deep darkness beyond the kingdom.

3402
03:29:05,580 --> 03:29:09,060
Through her devotion, Hallnest lasts eternal.

3403
03:29:11,220 --> 03:29:11,520
Oh?

3404
03:29:13,960 --> 03:29:16,040
Dreamer locations added to the map.

3405
03:29:19,180 --> 03:29:21,500
Go no further, little shadow.

3406
03:29:22,200 --> 03:29:24,220
What compels its climb out of the dark?

3407
03:29:24,240 --> 03:29:28,320
what compels its return to the sacred kingdom.

3408
03:29:28,980 --> 03:29:30,420
A call from beyond the seals.

3409
03:29:31,140 --> 03:29:34,400
Buy the vessel or buy that captain life.

3410
03:29:34,860 --> 03:29:37,760
With the seals break, they cannot be undone.

3411
03:29:38,260 --> 03:29:39,620
But the vessel weakens.

3412
03:29:39,860 --> 03:29:41,540
That plague springs anew.

3413
03:29:42,060 --> 03:29:43,620
They must be undone.

3414
03:29:44,360 --> 03:29:46,420
Yet still our seals remain.

3415
03:29:46,860 --> 03:29:47,920
Our duty holds.

3416
03:29:48,320 --> 03:29:50,040
It must be cast away.

3417
03:29:50,620 --> 03:29:51,660
Our duty holds.

3418
03:29:51,820 --> 03:29:52,820
It shall be done.

3419
03:29:54,240 --> 03:29:54,700
What happened?

3420
03:29:55,060 --> 03:29:57,420
Oh my god, bug aliens!

3421
03:30:02,220 --> 03:30:03,700
Fade away, little shadow.

3422
03:30:04,960 --> 03:30:05,440
Fade away.

3423
03:30:06,220 --> 03:30:07,980
And let us sleep in peace.

3424
03:30:12,090 --> 03:30:13,290
Oh, it's just sleeping.

3425
03:30:14,070 --> 03:30:15,150
What a weird dream.

3426
03:30:16,370 --> 03:30:16,970
Wow.

3427
03:30:17,750 --> 03:30:18,950
What a weird dream.

3428
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:20,850
How the fuck do I get out of here?

3429
03:30:21,870 --> 03:30:22,130
Oh?

3430
03:30:23,410 --> 03:30:23,910
Hello?

3431
03:30:25,670 --> 03:30:26,150
Oh.

3432
03:30:27,810 --> 03:30:28,770
still dreaming.

3433
03:30:35,030 --> 03:30:35,450
Go, go, go.

3434
03:30:36,650 --> 03:30:37,750
Why is there a downside?

3435
03:30:41,650 --> 03:30:42,090
Okay.

3436
03:30:44,850 --> 03:30:47,270
Like, why is there, like, a random one that's down here?

3437
03:30:48,030 --> 03:30:48,970
Like, is there a secret?

3438
03:30:50,530 --> 03:30:51,430
I like that.

3439
03:30:51,950 --> 03:30:53,830
It's, like, tempting me to jump down.

3440
03:30:54,430 --> 03:30:57,110
I feel like if I do that, I'm going to lose all my progress.

3441
03:31:00,250 --> 03:31:00,910
The boy.

3442
03:31:05,450 --> 03:31:06,170
All right.

3443
03:31:06,730 --> 03:31:08,350
Get a right out go.

3444
03:31:11,110 --> 03:31:11,710
Yo.

3445
03:31:12,010 --> 03:31:13,150
Oh, it's a moth!

3446
03:31:14,090 --> 03:31:17,930
What a terrible fate they visited upon you.

3447
03:31:18,170 --> 03:31:21,230
To cast you away in the space between body and soul.

3448
03:31:22,370 --> 03:31:24,730
Will you accept your judgment and fade slowly away?

3449
03:31:25,330 --> 03:31:30,790
Or will you take the weapon before you and cut your way out of the sad, forgotten dream?

3450
03:31:31,270 --> 03:31:31,970
All right.

3451
03:31:32,310 --> 03:31:33,630
I want to say no to a free weapon.

3452
03:31:33,650 --> 03:31:33,890
in.

3453
03:31:34,330 --> 03:31:34,750
Yoink.

3454
03:31:39,580 --> 03:31:40,860
Free is free.

3455
03:31:42,340 --> 03:31:43,620
Taken the dream nail.

3456
03:31:44,220 --> 03:31:46,000
A charge and slash from the nail.

3457
03:31:46,400 --> 03:31:49,360
Cut through the veil between dream and waking.

3458
03:31:50,700 --> 03:31:50,800
Okay.

3459
03:31:55,460 --> 03:31:56,300
Okay.

3460
03:32:00,220 --> 03:32:00,640
Ah!

3461
03:32:00,640 --> 03:32:02,100
You returned!

3462
03:32:02,840 --> 03:32:05,260
Welcome back to the waking world.

3463
03:32:06,020 --> 03:32:06,840
Those figures.

3464
03:32:07,160 --> 03:32:08,000
Those dreamers.

3465
03:32:08,020 --> 03:33:09,640
They reached out with what little power they still have And dragged you into the sitting place That talisman you now wield The dream now You can cut through the veil that separates The waking world from our dreams Even the dreamers themselves Can not hide from such a weapon Though I must admit That sacred blade has to hold over time Together perhaps we can restore its powers Only out to bring me Essence Essence fragments of life that dreams are made of collect it whenever you find it and bring it to me once we have enough we can work wonders together go out into the world wielder hunt down the essence that lingers there collect a hundred essence and return to me i'll teach you more what are you doing poking about a dusty old man like mine nothing i'm worth this hidden side believe me.

3466
03:33:09,660 --> 03:33:12,500
I keep hovering around the world with you and your dream now.

3467
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:14,560
Other things will reveal itself.

3468
03:33:14,720 --> 03:33:15,920
What the fuck do I do with this?

3469
03:33:17,420 --> 03:33:19,460
Wait, what do I do with this, though?

3470
03:33:25,010 --> 03:33:27,090
How the fuck do I do with the dream now?

3471
03:33:28,870 --> 03:33:29,330
Oh!

3472
03:33:29,570 --> 03:33:30,450
Is it... Oh!

3473
03:33:32,510 --> 03:33:33,730
These trees!

3474
03:33:34,570 --> 03:33:37,570
Oh my god, I don't remember where any of these trees are.

3475
03:33:41,410 --> 03:33:42,370
Is it time?

3476
03:33:42,370 --> 03:33:44,070
Or are these timed?

3477
03:33:47,930 --> 03:33:49,130
Wait, there's one up top.

3478
03:33:53,900 --> 03:33:55,380
Oh, it's like, they're like dream catchers.

3479
03:33:55,480 --> 03:33:57,660
They're shaped like dream catchers, I just noticed.

3480
03:34:00,820 --> 03:34:01,140
No?

3481
03:34:01,500 --> 03:34:02,400
Okay, nice.

3482
03:34:03,860 --> 03:34:04,740
Oh, there's so many.

3483
03:34:04,840 --> 03:34:05,740
Oh, are these Essence?

3484
03:34:06,020 --> 03:34:07,520
Oh, they're Essence!

3485
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:13,240
Holy shit, it's just nearly all Essence.

3486
03:34:14,980 --> 03:34:16,980
I just realized...

3487
03:34:18,620 --> 03:34:20,160
Oh, I don't have...

3488
03:34:21,060 --> 03:34:22,760
I don't have enough souls for that.

3489
03:34:24,300 --> 03:34:26,040
Okay, that should be the last one.

3490
03:34:28,360 --> 03:34:28,740
Yay!

3491
03:34:29,320 --> 03:34:30,280
I did it!

3492
03:34:31,420 --> 03:34:33,420
There is a stack station here.

3493
03:34:34,780 --> 03:34:35,480
So... Oh.

3494
03:34:36,980 --> 03:34:38,220
You were here?

3495
03:34:39,580 --> 03:34:42,420
Okay, I gotta buy it from him then.

3496
03:34:43,340 --> 03:34:44,960
All right, get over here.

3497
03:34:47,340 --> 03:35:16,920
Oh my god, I didn't have to pay for this one Where was, okay, I don't have a map Oh my god The government paid for this one finally So many great Were more fairs and old Siamese I've forgotten Somewhere along The line lies the stag nest The place where I was born And raised I thought its Location lost to my failing mind But now I can almost remember the path.

3498
03:35:17,560 --> 03:35:20,080
They keep open static station, infecting me through them.

3499
03:35:20,520 --> 03:35:22,480
First again, find that nest.

3500
03:35:23,380 --> 03:35:25,360
I would like that very much.

3501
03:35:25,660 --> 03:35:25,900
All right.

3502
03:35:26,480 --> 03:35:27,500
The resting ground.

3503
03:35:27,620 --> 03:35:28,700
All right, we got by the map.

3504
03:35:30,180 --> 03:35:32,580
We got by the map from his wife.

3505
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:37,320
You're like, it can give you a chunk of salt.

3506
03:35:37,420 --> 03:35:38,940
You can do a lot of different things.

3507
03:35:39,300 --> 03:35:39,920
Like what?

3508
03:35:41,880 --> 03:35:44,520
Oh, oh yeah, I can like analyze him.

3509
03:35:46,280 --> 03:35:47,900
All right, I'll analyze them.

3510
03:35:48,900 --> 03:35:49,380
I'm gonna say.

3511
03:35:51,220 --> 03:35:51,820
Slash!

3512
03:35:53,380 --> 03:35:57,180
I tire so easily now, and my old legs seem to take more and more.

3513
03:35:57,760 --> 03:36:01,240
So, I'm lucky to grow old at all.

3514
03:36:01,800 --> 03:36:03,240
So many others have it.

3515
03:36:03,400 --> 03:36:03,660
Oh, no.

3516
03:36:05,140 --> 03:36:07,240
They got taken by the bug catchers.

3517
03:36:08,720 --> 03:36:09,240
Oh, no.

3518
03:36:09,840 --> 03:36:13,160
They're all in the illegal beetle fight ring.

3519
03:36:16,640 --> 03:36:18,880
Oh, I'll slash this old man.

3520
03:36:20,320 --> 03:36:20,560
Splash!

3521
03:36:22,100 --> 03:36:23,360
Descend into that ruin.

3522
03:36:23,660 --> 03:36:23,900
Why?

3523
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:26,420
Things are so much simpler here.

3524
03:36:27,640 --> 03:36:29,360
Heard the tales of the Kolar's lines.

3525
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:32,160
A web of a tunnel is running all through the kingdom.

3526
03:36:32,720 --> 03:36:34,140
I'm quite content where I am.

3527
03:36:39,100 --> 03:36:39,580
Alright.

3528
03:36:39,980 --> 03:36:41,520
We gotta get the resting grounds.

3529
03:36:43,060 --> 03:36:43,940
Okay, is she gonna...

3530
03:36:43,940 --> 03:36:45,700
What is she gonna say about her husband?

3531
03:36:46,820 --> 03:36:47,300
Slash!

3532
03:36:48,200 --> 03:36:51,720
I'm glad I put my weapon down my weapon.

3533
03:36:51,720 --> 03:36:54,220
Quiet life with Courtney makes me a lot happier.

3534
03:36:54,800 --> 03:36:56,920
It would be nice to stretch my legs again, though.

3535
03:36:57,440 --> 03:36:58,300
Sometimes I'm scared.

3536
03:36:58,360 --> 03:37:01,180
I can't believe he would do such a thing to her.

3537
03:37:01,580 --> 03:37:04,260
Keeping her hold up in this shop.

3538
03:37:04,660 --> 03:37:06,260
I never do that to you, baby girl.

3539
03:37:06,640 --> 03:37:09,820
If you come with me, we can go adventuring everywhere.

3540
03:37:13,140 --> 03:37:14,200
Can't believe it.

3541
03:37:14,440 --> 03:37:16,840
She is a free thinker.

3542
03:37:18,200 --> 03:37:20,620
to be locked in that shop.

3543
03:37:21,900 --> 03:37:23,060
She's not actually happy.

3544
03:37:23,180 --> 03:37:24,060
She's coping, guys.

3545
03:37:24,240 --> 03:37:25,460
Do we not read the same...

3546
03:37:25,460 --> 03:37:27,500
Do we not read the same dialogue?

3547
03:37:28,020 --> 03:37:29,500
She's just coping.

3548
03:37:30,200 --> 03:37:36,470
All right, we got to this way.

3549
03:37:39,050 --> 03:37:40,470
No, she's coping, guys.

3550
03:37:42,290 --> 03:37:45,570
Okay, we gotta grab more souls so I can unlock that crypt.

3551
03:37:47,030 --> 03:37:48,670
Just think it was a super chat.

3552
03:37:48,730 --> 03:37:48,990
Thank you.

3553
03:37:49,110 --> 03:37:49,610
Thank you.

3554
03:37:51,010 --> 03:37:52,550
ma'am, I'll free you.

3555
03:37:57,220 --> 03:37:58,080
Wait, is it this again?

3556
03:37:59,020 --> 03:38:00,940
Am I going to be trapped in the dream world again?

3557
03:38:01,880 --> 03:38:02,920
For reading this?

3558
03:38:03,700 --> 03:38:04,480
No, okay.

3559
03:38:06,480 --> 03:38:07,740
I couldn't tell.

3560
03:38:09,460 --> 03:38:09,780
Alright.

3561
03:38:16,640 --> 03:38:17,720
Oh, wait, what's this?

3562
03:38:17,820 --> 03:38:19,440
Oh, that's a dream thing.

3563
03:38:20,280 --> 03:38:21,240
I recognize that.

3564
03:38:23,080 --> 03:38:23,580
Flash!

3565
03:38:24,020 --> 03:38:24,580
Oh, shit!

3566
03:38:24,800 --> 03:38:25,100
I'm sorry!

3567
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:26,620
Did I wake you from your slumber?

3568
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:27,380
Oh!

03:38:30,420 --> 03:39:28,900

03:39:31,220 --> 03:39:35,820
Thanks for letting me like, I mean, I guess I'll take the free heal.

3572
03:39:36,440 --> 03:39:37,680
I'm not complaining.

3573
03:39:42,240 --> 03:39:44,840
Jesus Christ, how much HP do you have?

3574
03:39:47,080 --> 03:39:47,600
Nice.

3575
03:39:49,700 --> 03:39:50,840
Alright, hello.

3576
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:56,240
I can see now, those who turn against the king are doomed.

3577
03:39:58,000 --> 03:39:58,960
their weapons.

3578
03:39:59,680 --> 03:40:00,840
Do not call me a traitor.

3579
03:40:01,680 --> 03:40:02,780
Simply call me a fool.

3580
03:40:03,900 --> 03:40:05,020
I know you want to flee.

3581
03:40:05,760 --> 03:40:06,520
Where you will go.

3582
03:40:07,160 --> 03:40:08,620
I will be watching.

3583
03:40:09,620 --> 03:40:10,500
Oh shit, I did it.

3584
03:40:11,820 --> 03:40:14,600
I just wanted to read his minds and then he attacked me.

3585
03:40:14,760 --> 03:40:15,460
It's fucked up.

3586
03:40:15,600 --> 03:40:16,740
Nice, I got essence though.

3587
03:40:17,700 --> 03:40:18,760
Curse your dose to turn against.

3588
03:40:18,840 --> 03:40:19,980
Oh, it's this thing.

3589
03:40:22,400 --> 03:40:23,020
Oh, man.

3590
03:40:23,340 --> 03:40:25,840
I used up my heels for that.

3591
03:40:25,960 --> 03:40:26,860
The soles for that.

3592
03:40:28,620 --> 03:40:35,020
It has to be, like, an area where I can gather some souls.

3593
03:40:38,100 --> 03:40:39,220
That's another...

3594
03:40:39,220 --> 03:40:39,760
Oh.

3595
03:40:41,060 --> 03:40:41,620
What?

3596
03:40:42,180 --> 03:40:43,140
Where does this go?

3597
03:40:45,840 --> 03:40:46,940
Oh, nowhere.

3598
03:40:50,900 --> 03:40:52,620
I can slot for some kind of pass.

3599
03:40:52,720 --> 03:40:53,720
Oh, I don't have it.

3600
03:40:54,460 --> 03:40:56,140
I don't have the pass.

3601
03:40:56,920 --> 03:40:58,440
Who's going to give me the pass?

3602
03:41:02,000 --> 03:41:12,320

3604
03:41:36,200 --> 03:41:42,200
is there any soul area here because that's the stag.

3605
03:41:43,720 --> 03:41:44,560
There's the tree.

3606
03:41:48,730 --> 03:41:50,150
There's a room to the red.

3607
03:41:50,350 --> 03:41:50,850
This one?

3608
03:41:51,350 --> 03:41:52,290
I can't open that.

3609
03:41:52,550 --> 03:41:54,010
Or I can't open that either.

3610
03:41:54,210 --> 03:41:55,530
This is the stag area.

3611
03:41:59,090 --> 03:42:00,190
Can I use the dream?

3612
03:42:02,570 --> 03:42:03,090
No.

3613
03:42:05,010 --> 03:42:06,370
Oh, talk to the seer?

3614
03:42:10,720 --> 03:42:12,860
Let me have a look at the dream now.

3615
03:42:13,160 --> 03:42:45,860
Hmm, already you collect 100 essence things come naturally to you don't they no wonder the dreamers try to bury you in that old dream perhaps you frightened them or perhaps being prisoners themselves they desire your company in any case you still have a long way to go take this old trinket as encouragement from me and return where you collected 200 essence oh nice priest uh after out real quick.

3616
03:42:46,700 --> 03:42:47,340
Another freestyle.

3617
03:42:50,120 --> 03:42:50,600
Alright.

3618
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:54,280
I still need anything down here.

3619
03:42:56,640 --> 03:42:57,120
Oh, nice.

3620
03:42:57,240 --> 03:42:58,100
Okay, we need that.

3621
03:42:59,180 --> 03:43:00,040
I didn't see that.

3622
03:43:00,160 --> 03:43:00,640
Alright, nice.

3623
03:43:00,760 --> 03:43:02,900
Okay, now we can open the creepy old crypt.

3624
03:43:05,040 --> 03:43:05,460
Hoop.

3625
03:43:07,480 --> 03:43:08,480
Oh, shit.

3626
03:43:10,840 --> 03:43:11,760
What's this?

3627
03:43:14,280 --> 03:43:14,860
Oh.

3628
03:43:19,300 --> 03:43:20,850
Oh, he's dead.

3629
03:43:23,040 --> 03:43:24,300
Guys, did I kill the...

3630
03:43:25,180 --> 03:43:26,800
Did I kill the injured and sick?

3631
03:43:27,180 --> 03:43:27,440
No.

3632
03:43:28,200 --> 03:43:28,380
Right?

3633
03:43:28,480 --> 03:43:29,220
Guys, you saw it.

3634
03:43:29,280 --> 03:43:29,980
It was self-defense.

3635
03:43:31,260 --> 03:43:32,480
You saw that.

3636
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:34,240
It was self-defense, guys.

3637
03:43:34,800 --> 03:43:36,040
I didn't kill...

3638
03:43:36,040 --> 03:43:38,620
I didn't kill the injured or sick, guys.

3639
03:43:38,960 --> 03:43:40,920
I was simply defending myself.

3640
03:43:45,080 --> 03:43:45,540
Oh.

3641
03:43:46,340 --> 03:43:48,080
I was like, what's underneath me?

3642
03:43:48,700 --> 03:43:49,220
Oh.

3643
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:50,100
Oh.

3644
03:43:51,880 --> 03:43:53,900
I was like thinking, is that?

3645
03:43:55,960 --> 03:43:56,820
What are they called?

3646
03:43:57,080 --> 03:43:59,600
Like, are they lepers?

3647
03:43:59,880 --> 03:44:01,060
I was like, oh my god, did I?

3648
03:44:01,640 --> 03:44:02,180
Oh no.

3649
03:44:07,040 --> 03:44:08,620
Oh, it's self-defense.

3650
03:44:08,900 --> 03:44:09,980
You came at me first.

3651
03:44:15,220 --> 03:44:15,960
What was that?

3652
03:44:17,080 --> 03:44:17,780
A soul eater.

3653
03:44:18,320 --> 03:44:19,120
What's a soul eater?

3654
03:44:25,790 --> 03:44:26,310
Forgotten.

3655
03:44:28,490 --> 03:44:32,770
to draw soul from still really increased amount of soul gain when striking an enemy with a nail.

3656
03:44:33,190 --> 03:44:34,510
Oh, wait, that's better than this.

3657
03:44:35,990 --> 03:44:39,010
Oh, but then I think, okay, but I don't have enough.

3658
03:44:39,890 --> 03:44:41,170
I can't do anything with it.

3659
03:44:42,150 --> 03:44:43,010
I don't have enough.

3660
03:44:43,130 --> 03:44:43,650
Oh, shit.

3661
03:44:44,430 --> 03:44:45,610
Okay, I got healed first.

3662
03:44:48,770 --> 03:44:52,030
Yeah, but I need like, I need slots for it.

3663
03:44:52,090 --> 03:44:53,110
I don't have enough slots.

3664
03:44:57,600 --> 03:44:58,040
Okay.

3665
03:44:58,840 --> 03:45:13,480
There must be something to my left then okay this is how you get out so i'm gonna go this way first

3666
03:45:16,840 --> 03:45:33,020

3667
03:45:35,420 --> 03:45:37,620
It was self-defense, guys.

3668
03:45:38,740 --> 03:45:39,560
He had intent.

3669
03:45:39,840 --> 03:45:40,280
Exactly.

3670
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:42,660
He had intent, guys.

3671
03:45:43,380 --> 03:45:44,280
Now where am I?

3672
03:45:44,820 --> 03:45:45,480
Wait, what?

3673
03:45:46,860 --> 03:45:47,700
Where is this place?

3674
03:45:50,620 --> 03:45:51,980
What the fuck?

3675
03:45:52,100 --> 03:45:52,760
Where am I?

3676
03:45:54,000 --> 03:45:56,200
Yeah, those were killer eyes.

3677
03:45:57,540 --> 03:45:58,600
I can go down.

3678
03:46:02,900 --> 03:46:03,540
Oh!

3679
03:46:05,780 --> 03:46:06,220
What?

3680
03:46:08,520 --> 03:46:10,060
Where is this place?

3681
03:46:11,100 --> 03:46:12,980
I killed the rich bugs though.

3682
03:46:19,920 --> 03:46:20,800
Eat the rich.

3683
03:46:21,420 --> 03:46:23,020
Alright, let's go back up.

3684
03:46:32,120 --> 03:46:33,400
Uh, uh...

3685
03:46:33,400 --> 03:46:34,620
Guess I'll go this way?

3686
03:46:41,380 --> 03:46:43,220
You're more breakable stuff.

3687
03:46:46,800 --> 03:46:47,660
Oh, here.

3688
03:46:51,670 --> 03:46:53,690
I was like, there has to be one more breakable thing.

3689
03:46:53,850 --> 03:46:54,340
I hear it.

3690
03:46:57,210 --> 03:46:58,950
So many secrets in here.

3691
03:47:00,890 --> 03:47:01,210
Hello.

3692
03:47:01,610 --> 03:47:02,410
Knock, knock.

3693
03:47:03,610 --> 03:47:04,870
Scrape robber here.

3694
03:47:06,070 --> 03:47:07,750
I come from the UK.

3695
03:47:08,630 --> 03:47:08,910
Nice.

3696
03:47:10,050 --> 03:47:10,950
We're here for them.

3697
03:47:11,150 --> 03:47:11,870
Our museums.

3698
03:47:15,330 --> 03:47:16,250
There's more to the left.

3699
03:47:16,470 --> 03:47:16,690
Yeah?

3700
03:47:18,190 --> 03:47:19,630
I don't think so.

3701
03:47:21,390 --> 03:47:21,430
Alright.

3702
03:47:22,650 --> 03:47:23,510
Where else do we go?

3703
03:47:24,350 --> 03:47:27,390
I feel like if I take the...

3704
03:47:31,980 --> 03:47:32,460
What?

3705
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:35,520
Yeah, I got all the I got all the walls here.

3706
03:47:36,260 --> 03:47:38,380
Unless there's a... Okay, where does this go?

3707
03:47:40,900 --> 03:47:42,840
Oh, it goes back to the crib.

3708
03:47:43,360 --> 03:47:46,600
Okay, there was a breakable floor down here.

3709
03:47:50,080 --> 03:47:52,880
With the Oh, it wasn't.

3710
03:47:52,980 --> 03:47:55,000
It was with the ghost I killed.

3711
03:47:58,560 --> 03:47:59,520
It's like right here.

3712
03:48:01,040 --> 03:48:01,460
God damn it.

3713
03:48:01,580 --> 03:48:02,940
I didn't realize I ran out of slows.

3714
03:48:05,940 --> 03:48:06,920
Alright, never mind.

3715
03:48:07,120 --> 03:48:08,360
Guess we'll never find out.

3716
03:48:09,940 --> 03:48:11,160
We'll never find out.

3717
03:48:11,200 --> 03:48:12,900
We'll go back into the crypt key.

3718
03:48:21,610 --> 03:48:21,970
Alright.

3719
03:48:23,830 --> 03:48:25,290
Go to the left area.

3720
03:48:29,230 --> 03:48:29,710
Wee!

3721
03:48:32,930 --> 03:48:34,190
To the left, right?

3722
03:48:36,290 --> 03:48:38,310
I feel like to go back to, like...

3723
03:48:38,310 --> 03:48:39,210
Oh my god, what?

3724
03:48:40,190 --> 03:48:40,490
What?

3725
03:48:43,130 --> 03:48:44,470
I think I might die.

3726
03:48:45,490 --> 03:48:45,890
Okay, wait.

3727
03:48:46,330 --> 03:48:47,710
I gotta kill the rich real quick.

3728
03:48:47,870 --> 03:48:48,490
Give me a sec.

3729
03:48:51,870 --> 03:48:52,890
Give me a sec.

3730
03:48:59,090 --> 03:48:59,810
Wait, where are they?

3731
03:48:59,950 --> 03:49:01,090
Did I kill all of them?

3732
03:49:01,270 --> 03:49:02,130
Oh, that's awkward.

3733
03:49:06,180 --> 03:49:07,360
Okay, this guy.

3734
03:49:09,760 --> 03:49:11,540

All right, there we go.

3736
03:49:18,280 --> 03:49:19,060
Oh, shit!

3737
03:49:19,260 --> 03:49:20,420

3738
03:49:21,120 --> 03:49:23,440
Where did the bodyguard come from?

3739
03:49:23,840 --> 03:49:25,180

3742
03:49:34,460 --> 03:49:36,160
The bodyguard came out.

3745
03:50:16,190 --> 03:50:17,150

3746
03:50:17,370 --> 03:50:18,570
What do I want me to do?

3747
03:50:19,290 --> 03:50:19,770

That's fine.

3756
03:50:46,070 --> 03:50:46,990
A fucking corpse.

3757
03:50:47,010 --> 03:50:49,470
I would accidentally get into a trap room.

3758
03:50:50,730 --> 03:50:52,870
They baited me with all these wealthy bugs.

3759
03:50:53,810 --> 03:50:54,950
It was just so tempting.

3760
03:50:55,170 --> 03:50:57,470
They're like, oh, she would never, she could never resist.

3761
03:50:58,550 --> 03:50:59,810
Killing all the rich.

3762
03:51:02,490 --> 03:51:04,270
She couldn't resist, and they were right.

3763
03:51:05,090 --> 03:51:06,110
They were fucking right.

3764
03:51:11,850 --> 03:51:12,370
Alright.

3765
03:51:13,610 --> 03:51:14,450

3766
03:51:20,490 --> 03:51:20,790
Nice.

3767
03:51:24,530 --> 03:51:26,750
How the fuck are you still alive?

3768
03:51:27,950 --> 03:51:30,010
As greedy as they are.

3769
03:51:30,870 --> 03:51:31,450
Oh nice.

3770
03:51:33,110 --> 03:51:35,010
I mean, I needed this anyway.

3771
03:51:36,750 --> 03:51:36,790

3772
03:51:40,470 --> 03:51:41,370

And nice.

3776
03:51:54,030 --> 03:51:55,550
And now we can go back down.

3777
03:51:59,950 --> 03:52:02,390
Okay, and I actually need that for HP.

3778
03:52:03,070 --> 03:52:03,830
Yeah, totally.

3779
03:52:04,350 --> 03:52:04,610
Yeah!

3780
03:52:06,410 --> 03:52:06,890
People...

3781
03:52:06,890 --> 03:52:07,410
Why?

3782
03:52:07,530 --> 03:52:09,710
You think people would just lie on the internet like that?

3783
03:52:17,300 --> 03:52:18,540
That's fucked up.

3784
03:52:21,780 --> 03:52:23,780
Oh my god, I really...

3785
03:52:23,780 --> 03:52:24,920
Dude, I want to deal with these guys.

3786
03:52:31,680 --> 03:52:32,080
Okay.

3787
03:52:32,340 --> 03:52:35,160
I don't know what this opens, but...

3788
03:52:35,160 --> 03:52:35,760
You go up.

3789
03:52:37,420 --> 03:52:38,860
Oh, it's back here.

3790
03:52:39,500 --> 03:52:40,040
Oh.

3791
03:52:42,640 --> 03:52:44,120
Man, thank you for the raid.

3792
03:52:44,400 --> 03:52:44,520
Thank you.

3793
03:52:44,920 --> 03:52:45,340
Thank you.

3794
03:52:45,720 --> 03:52:46,700
I appreciate it.

3795
03:52:46,920 --> 03:52:47,160
Oh, nice.

3796
03:52:47,240 --> 03:52:47,560
Secret.

3797
03:52:48,480 --> 03:52:49,340
Oh, it was just morsels.

3798
03:52:51,600 --> 03:52:52,000
Okay.

3799
03:52:52,920 --> 03:52:53,740
Go left.

3800
03:52:55,860 --> 03:52:56,300
What's this?

3801
03:52:57,680 --> 03:52:59,040
Oh, is this a hot springs?

3802
03:52:59,880 --> 03:53:00,760
Oh, it's just a lake.

3803
03:53:02,400 --> 03:53:03,560
I swim, swim, swim.

3804
03:53:04,500 --> 03:53:05,520
Swim, swim, swim.

3805
03:53:06,900 --> 03:53:08,040
I keep swimming.

3806
03:53:08,940 --> 03:53:09,480
swimming.

3807
03:53:11,260 --> 03:53:12,480
I'm still swimming.

3808
03:53:15,300 --> 03:53:17,840
I don't know if I'm supposed to be swimming.

3809
03:53:20,140 --> 03:53:21,380
Just keep swimming.

3810
03:53:21,580 --> 03:53:22,420
Oh, there he is.

3811
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:25,460
Oh, what a calm place.

3812
03:53:26,120 --> 03:53:27,280
These actions I want.

3813
03:53:27,460 --> 03:53:28,840
Vicious and deadly battle.

3814
03:53:29,220 --> 03:53:31,260
This sinner, I think, is a boar.

3815
03:53:32,780 --> 03:53:33,140
Oh.

3816
03:53:33,500 --> 03:53:34,520
It's like me.

3817
03:53:35,440 --> 03:53:36,560
I hate nature.

3818
03:53:40,040 --> 03:53:40,680
Okay.

3819
03:53:40,700 --> 03:53:42,180
Wait, is that it?

3820
03:53:50,110 --> 03:53:51,350
Is that it?

3821
03:53:52,810 --> 03:53:53,410

Doki will never lie to attack bugs unjustly.

3825
03:53:57,710 --> 03:53:58,130
Exactly.

3826
03:53:58,370 --> 03:53:59,350
Why would I ever do that?

3827
03:53:59,490 --> 03:54:00,530
It's pretty fucked up.

3828
03:54:01,530 --> 03:54:02,550
I can...

3829
03:54:02,550 --> 03:54:03,110

3830
03:54:03,290 --> 03:54:04,510

04:00:03,830 --> 04:00:18,790
yeah I either die from like the dumbest enemies or like platforming I don't even remember like how where to go I don't remember it.

3906
04:00:20,430 --> 04:00:21,590
Okay, maybe here.

3907
04:00:29,500 --> 04:00:29,920
Okay.

3908
04:00:30,600 --> 04:00:31,200
Yay!

3909
04:00:32,340 --> 04:00:33,140
Maybe here?

3910
04:00:33,780 --> 04:00:36,920
Okay, I thought there was something here.

3911
04:00:38,880 --> 04:00:40,880
I didn't even see that Cornelius.

3912
04:00:41,020 --> 04:00:44,020
He hasn't left me, um, like, a trail.

3913
04:00:45,520 --> 04:00:46,360
Oh, fuck.

3914
04:00:46,500 --> 04:00:47,100
Oh, no.

3915
04:00:47,300 --> 04:00:48,380
Not these.

3916
04:00:49,600 --> 04:00:50,700
I'm just gonna go this way.

3917
04:00:50,900 --> 04:00:51,800
Fuck that shit.

3918
04:00:53,960 --> 04:00:55,200
Government check right there.

3919
04:00:55,540 --> 04:00:56,180
Have to do it.

3920
04:00:58,360 --> 04:00:59,160
Oh, okay.

3921
04:01:01,280 --> 04:01:01,680
Okay.

3922
04:01:08,560 --> 04:01:09,040
Oh, Mark.

3923
04:01:09,300 --> 04:01:09,480
Okay, wait.

3924
04:01:09,600 --> 04:01:10,120
Give me a sec.

3925
04:01:11,340 --> 04:01:12,900
Oh, I don't even have charge.

3926
04:01:23,890 --> 04:01:24,670
I swear to God.

3927
04:01:24,770 --> 04:01:26,890
If it makes me do the whole thing all over again, I swear to God.

3928
04:01:27,030 --> 04:01:27,690
Okay, nice.

3929
04:01:28,790 --> 04:01:29,330
Government check.

3930
04:01:30,050 --> 04:01:30,250
Done.

3931
04:01:30,370 --> 04:01:32,790
Another caterpillar in my foster care.

3932
04:01:34,990 --> 04:01:36,370
What the fuck is that?

3933
04:01:37,630 --> 04:01:38,110
Can I kill it?

3934
04:01:38,250 --> 04:01:39,310
Oh, I can't.

3935
04:01:40,490 --> 04:01:41,470
Okay, that's good to know.

3936
04:01:42,330 --> 04:01:44,010
Okay, I can't kill these.

3937
04:01:46,810 --> 04:01:49,770
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

3938
04:01:53,650 --> 04:01:53,650
oh.

3939
04:01:53,890 --> 04:01:54,090
Alright.

3940
04:01:54,310 --> 04:01:55,830
Oh, they don't even give me that money.

3941
04:01:55,930 --> 04:01:56,350
Oh, nice.

3942
04:01:56,490 --> 04:01:56,730
Okay.

3943
04:01:57,170 --> 04:01:58,590
I see the paper trip.

3944
04:01:59,010 --> 04:02:00,770
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3945
04:02:01,330 --> 04:02:01,790
Alright.

3946
04:02:02,050 --> 04:02:03,950
He's leaving the breadcrumbs.

3947
04:02:05,090 --> 04:02:05,970
Oh, my God.

3948
04:02:06,250 --> 04:02:07,350
Oh my god, I'm so overwhelmed.

3949
04:02:07,950 --> 04:02:09,250
There's so many lies.

3950
04:02:13,110 --> 04:02:13,830
Oh, there he is.

3951
04:02:16,130 --> 04:02:17,690
Come to scare the monsters.

3952
04:02:18,790 --> 04:02:22,150
I heard the telly of someone waiting out there too far for me, though.

3953
04:02:22,850 --> 04:02:24,930
And I'm not really one for heights.

3954
04:02:26,110 --> 04:02:26,970
Alright, nice.

3955
04:02:27,110 --> 04:02:28,370
Finally got the map.

3956
04:02:29,830 --> 04:02:30,390
Fucking finally.

3957
04:02:30,550 --> 04:02:31,650
How do I get up there?

3958
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:34,230
Because I don't have the item yet.

3959
04:02:38,770 --> 04:02:39,250
Um...

3960
04:02:39,790 --> 04:02:41,690
I don't think I'm allowed to go there.

3961
04:02:46,450 --> 04:02:48,010
Yeah, I'm not allowed to go there.

3962
04:02:48,390 --> 04:02:49,450
I guess I go up?

3963
04:02:53,280 --> 04:02:54,120
Am I gonna get... Yes.

3964
04:02:55,220 --> 04:02:55,560
Okay.

3965
04:02:55,880 --> 04:02:57,100
I need to grab those souls.

3966
04:03:01,220 --> 04:03:02,180
I really...

3967
04:03:02,180 --> 04:03:03,040
Oh, fuck!

3968
04:03:03,880 --> 04:03:05,740

He was just sitting on the...

3972
04:03:44,340 --> 04:03:46,180
I'm all the way here!

3973
04:03:49,260 --> 04:03:49,520
Okay.

3974
04:03:51,720 --> 04:03:54,200
If I take this, do I get the...

3975
04:03:54,200 --> 04:03:56,440
I mean, it's fine.

3976
04:03:57,680 --> 04:03:59,380
It's just double damage, right?

3977
04:03:59,540 --> 04:04:00,620
It should be fine.

3978
04:04:03,040 --> 04:04:04,920
It's so far!

3979
04:04:06,880 --> 04:04:09,180
It's so far.

3980
04:04:10,300 --> 04:04:11,780
Oh my god.

3981
04:04:13,080 --> 04:04:14,960
It's not fine.

3982
04:04:16,540 --> 04:04:18,060
Wait, was it the wrong charm?

3983
04:04:19,560 --> 04:04:21,340
Oh my god, it was the wrong charm.

3984
04:04:24,040 --> 04:04:24,800
Oh well.

3985
04:04:30,060 --> 04:04:32,300
All right, we'll go back.

3986
04:04:36,730 --> 04:04:37,590
Wrong charm.

3987
04:04:39,930 --> 04:04:43,210
I can't believe it in my first tribe boss run.

3988
04:04:44,110 --> 04:04:46,110
I just, it was just so much.

3989
04:04:47,510 --> 04:04:48,710
Oh, you know, that's not what we want.

3990
04:04:48,790 --> 04:04:49,990
We wanted, what was it called?

3991
04:04:50,850 --> 04:04:52,890
Traman stole this one, right?

3992
04:04:56,400 --> 04:04:57,260
Was it that?

3993
04:05:03,440 --> 04:05:04,920
Oh, so sad.

3994
04:05:10,120 --> 04:05:12,080

He was just a normal guy.

4018
04:08:50,630 --> 04:08:51,030

Oh, this area is fucking sucks.

4034
04:10:08,110 --> 04:10:10,170
Okay, map says this way.

4035
04:10:18,060 --> 04:10:20,040
Every new area sucks more and more.

4036
04:10:22,760 --> 04:10:23,640
Oh, hey, Coral.

4037
04:10:24,540 --> 04:10:26,120
I have quite a view, no?

4038
04:10:26,640 --> 04:10:30,160
I'm not surprised you survived the trek through these shimmering caverns.

4039
04:10:31,520 --> 04:10:32,740
a strength about you.

4040
04:10:33,340 --> 04:10:37,260
I suspect it would be quite intimidating if not for your small stature.

4041
04:10:38,920 --> 04:10:39,220
Thanks.

4042
04:10:39,400 --> 04:10:40,300
He called me a short.

4043
04:10:41,120 --> 04:10:42,400
Not even a short king.

4044
04:10:42,580 --> 04:10:43,960
That's so fucking rude.

4045
04:10:44,460 --> 04:10:45,260
I'll have you know.

4046
04:10:45,680 --> 04:10:47,880
I am almost five feet.

4047
04:10:48,060 --> 04:10:49,260
Wait, that's really tall for a buck.

4048
04:10:49,640 --> 04:10:51,180
I'm almost five inches.

4049
04:10:51,400 --> 04:10:52,280
I'll have you know.

4050
04:10:54,160 --> 04:10:56,180
I just haven't hit purity yet, okay?

4051
04:10:58,500 --> 04:11:00,420
God, so fucking rude.

4052
04:11:10,640 --> 04:11:11,320
All right.

4053
04:11:13,340 --> 04:11:14,380
Wait, there's something over here.

4054
04:11:18,720 --> 04:11:19,920
And that's money!

4055
04:11:22,160 --> 04:11:23,420
Why do I can...

4056
04:11:23,420 --> 04:11:25,260
Oh, I'm just thinking, can I like...

4057
04:11:26,400 --> 04:11:27,220
Just smack that.

4058
04:11:27,500 --> 04:11:28,360
Bumpa da da da.

4059
04:11:28,600 --> 04:11:29,240
Smack that.

4060
04:11:30,080 --> 04:11:30,860
All right, nice.

4061
04:11:31,000 --> 04:11:31,820
Oh, I got another journal.

4062
04:11:33,740 --> 04:11:35,060
What's below me, though?

4063
04:11:36,040 --> 04:11:37,400
Oh, it's another...

4064
04:11:38,520 --> 04:11:39,800
Another rancid egg.

4065
04:11:40,420 --> 04:11:41,240
That I can't even get.

4066
04:11:41,260 --> 04:11:41,600
it.

4067
04:11:45,100 --> 04:11:46,260
Is there anything here?

4068
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:49,460
What's the point of being here?

4069
04:11:51,000 --> 04:11:51,780
Hello?

4070
04:11:53,720 --> 04:11:54,320
Hello?

4071
04:11:56,460 --> 04:11:59,660
It's just going down and down and what?

4072
04:11:59,820 --> 04:12:00,860
What is this place?

4073
04:12:01,560 --> 04:12:02,300
Oh, a shortcut.

4074
04:12:06,660 --> 04:12:07,420
What the fuck?

4075
04:12:09,200 --> 04:12:10,120
Where am I?

4076
04:12:13,370 --> 04:12:15,070
It's So pretty, though.

4077
04:12:15,230 --> 04:12:15,970
I will admit.

4078
04:12:16,430 --> 04:12:17,590
This is really pretty.

4079
04:12:20,690 --> 04:12:21,990
Alright, and then Apako.

4080
04:12:22,210 --> 04:12:22,630
Oh, shit!

4081
04:12:22,730 --> 04:12:23,930
Okay, I need a dash for that.

4082
04:12:25,110 --> 04:12:26,250
I wasn't paying attention.

4083
04:12:32,640 --> 04:12:33,080
Alright.

4084
04:12:34,200 --> 04:12:36,740
I need to remember to just dash instead of jump.

4085
04:12:37,540 --> 04:12:38,360
Okay, shortcut.

4086
04:12:38,940 --> 04:12:40,220
Grab some souls.

4087
04:12:41,220 --> 04:12:42,560
Souls of the children.

4088
04:12:43,120 --> 04:12:44,420
Sustained my lifestyle.

4089
04:12:46,080 --> 04:12:46,860
Oh, my God.

4090
04:12:46,900 --> 04:12:47,760
What am I looking at?

4091
04:12:48,820 --> 04:12:51,180
What am I fucking looking at now?

4092
04:12:56,320 --> 04:12:56,740
Yeah.

4093
04:12:57,380 --> 04:12:58,320
Part four.

4094
04:13:00,580 --> 04:13:01,140
Part no!

4095
04:13:01,740 --> 04:13:01,880
No!

4096
04:13:03,700 --> 04:13:05,080
Oh, this is not fair.

4097
04:13:06,040 --> 04:13:06,980
This is not fair.

4098
04:13:08,440 --> 04:13:09,680
Oh, thank god there's more souls.

4099
04:13:12,900 --> 04:13:14,760
Yeah, this guy, that was a little messy.

4100
04:13:19,410 --> 04:13:20,390
Get down, I go.

4101
04:13:20,690 --> 04:13:20,950
Whoa!

4102
04:13:22,090 --> 04:13:22,690
so fast.

4103
04:13:23,610 --> 04:13:24,330
I didn't like it.

4104
04:13:24,770 --> 04:13:25,830
Can't do that way.

4105
04:13:26,050 --> 04:13:27,050
So I guess I go this way?

4106
04:13:28,330 --> 04:13:28,630
Hello?

4107
04:13:32,920 --> 04:13:33,960
It's a boy.

4108
04:13:34,780 --> 04:13:36,780
Oh, shit.

4109
04:13:36,980 --> 04:13:37,160
Hi.

4110
04:13:42,370 --> 04:13:43,410
Oh, crystal hard.

4111
04:13:43,610 --> 04:13:44,530
Hood LT.

4112
04:13:44,970 --> 04:13:45,450
Wild on the ground.

4113
04:13:46,010 --> 04:13:46,610
Click.

4114
04:13:46,790 --> 04:13:46,850
Click.

4115
04:13:46,970 --> 04:13:47,130
Townsend.

4116
04:13:47,410 --> 04:13:47,970
Release.

4117
04:13:48,430 --> 04:13:49,390
The blast forward.

4118
04:13:51,270 --> 04:13:51,750
LT.

4119
04:13:53,370 --> 04:13:54,190
That's it.

4120
04:13:55,090 --> 04:13:55,450
Wee!

4121
04:13:55,830 --> 04:13:56,770
Oh, that's cool.

4122
04:13:57,230 --> 04:13:58,350
Oh, I got dashed.

4123
04:13:58,350 --> 04:13:59,350
I got super dash.

4124
04:14:00,610 --> 04:14:00,970
Wee!

4125
04:14:04,680 --> 04:14:05,040
Yay!

4126
04:14:10,100 --> 04:14:10,460
Wee!

4127
04:14:13,080 --> 04:14:13,720
Oh, shit.

4128
04:14:13,880 --> 04:14:14,420
I can't stop.

4129
04:14:16,140 --> 04:14:17,080
Alright, now I can.

4130
04:14:17,640 --> 04:14:18,240
Oh, is that it?

4131
04:14:18,480 --> 04:14:19,200
Is that all I need to get?

4132
04:14:19,540 --> 04:14:20,920
There has to be a boss fight here.

4133
04:14:21,960 --> 04:14:22,220
Alright?

4134
04:14:25,480 --> 04:14:26,420
Wait, where am I?

4135
04:14:27,340 --> 04:14:28,480
I feel like I'm...

4136
04:14:29,560 --> 04:14:31,080
Oh, I missed a grub?

4137
04:14:32,620 --> 04:14:33,620
There's a grub.

4138
04:14:41,510 --> 04:14:42,550
Oh, I hear it.

4139
04:14:42,570 --> 04:14:43,510
Oh, I hear him.

4140
04:14:44,250 --> 04:14:45,710
Okay, but how do you get that?

4141
04:14:45,970 --> 04:14:46,910
He's so far up.

4142
04:14:47,070 --> 04:14:47,630
Oh, here?

4143
04:14:48,990 --> 04:14:49,450
Oh!

4144
04:14:55,770 --> 04:14:56,750
Oh, okay, wait.

4145
04:14:57,070 --> 04:14:57,630
I get it.

4146
04:15:00,590 --> 04:15:02,650
How do I do the super charge?

4147
04:15:08,720 --> 04:15:09,800
Oh, I get there.

4148
04:15:16,760 --> 04:15:18,540
Yeah, but we can't do the dash.

4149
04:15:20,580 --> 04:15:22,780
Why wouldn't it let me do the dash on the wall?

4150
04:15:25,840 --> 04:15:26,260
What?

4151
04:15:30,710 --> 04:15:32,750
I'm trying to, but...

4152
04:15:36,650 --> 04:15:38,650
When I'm sliding, it won't let me.

4153
04:15:40,030 --> 04:15:41,070
Wait, how did I do that?

4154
04:15:44,850 --> 04:15:45,570
Wait, what?

4155
04:15:47,650 --> 04:15:48,070
Oh!

4156
04:15:48,250 --> 04:15:49,290
Okay, I get it.

4157
04:15:49,410 --> 04:15:50,010

Oh, yeah, I can.

4163
04:16:35,420 --> 04:16:35,680
Nice.

Yay, shortcut.

4165
04:16:42,380 --> 04:16:42,760
Okay.

4166
04:16:43,120 --> 04:16:43,920
I'm going to use the bathroom.

4167
04:16:44,060 --> 04:16:45,920
I haven't eaten yet in four hours.

4168
04:16:46,140 --> 04:16:47,020
I'll be right back, guys.

4169
04:18:21,110 --> 04:18:22,490
I'm back, everybody.

4170
04:18:23,170 --> 04:18:24,330
Next scene you're in me.

4171
04:18:24,450 --> 04:18:25,370
Thank you for the super chat.

4172
04:18:25,490 --> 04:18:25,690
Thank you.

4173
04:18:26,090 --> 04:18:26,410
Thank you.

4174
04:18:26,670 --> 04:18:27,110
All right.

4175
04:18:27,890 --> 04:18:28,350
Wake up.

4176
04:18:28,550 --> 04:18:29,610
Wake up, Samurai.

4177
04:18:30,030 --> 04:18:30,670
It's time.

4178
04:18:31,470 --> 04:18:32,790
What the fuck do I go next?

4179
04:18:34,450 --> 04:18:35,550
Wake up, Samurai.

4180
04:18:35,710 --> 04:18:37,150
We gotta figure this out together.

4181
04:18:40,750 --> 04:18:41,270
Okay.

4182
04:18:41,610 --> 04:18:42,350
Maybe up?

4183
04:18:43,430 --> 04:18:44,850
I guess I have to go up.

4184
04:18:45,210 --> 04:18:46,170
There's stuff up there.

4185
04:18:47,090 --> 04:18:47,730
Ah, shit.

4186
04:18:47,990 --> 04:18:48,730
Oh, shit.

4187
04:18:49,210 --> 04:18:50,770
Oh, there's so many things!

4188
04:18:53,190 --> 04:18:54,370
Okay, it's this way.

4189
04:18:59,190 --> 04:18:59,710
Okay.

4190
04:19:01,290 --> 04:19:01,810
Up.

4191
04:19:02,550 --> 04:19:04,350
Okay, there's stuff upstairs that I haven't gone.

4192
04:19:07,070 --> 04:19:08,470
And it's like...

4193
04:19:08,470 --> 04:19:08,970
Far...

4194
04:19:08,970 --> 04:19:10,190
Okay, it's far up.

4195
04:19:11,810 --> 04:19:12,190
Hey?

4196
04:19:13,390 --> 04:19:15,390
I'm trying to read the map right now.

4197
04:19:16,330 --> 04:19:18,590
Guys, I might be really bad at reading this map.

4198
04:19:20,690 --> 04:19:21,990
That's just the maybe.

4199
04:19:25,290 --> 04:19:26,210
Can't go up.

4200
04:19:26,970 --> 04:19:28,170
So I go this way?

4201
04:19:30,530 --> 04:19:31,050
Yeah.

4202
04:19:31,070 --> 04:19:33,510
Yeah, but there's stuff on the right side I haven't gone yet.

4203
04:19:34,470 --> 04:19:34,870
Like here.

4204
04:19:36,730 --> 04:19:37,390
Right here.

4205
04:19:38,450 --> 04:19:39,250
Alright, never mind.

4206
04:19:39,470 --> 04:19:40,730
I guess I can't go there.

4207
04:19:41,130 --> 04:19:41,570
Never mind.

4208
04:19:41,650 --> 04:19:43,190
We'll go back to that one area.

4209
04:19:45,070 --> 04:19:45,610
Never mind.

4210
04:19:45,790 --> 04:19:46,630
We go down.

4211
04:19:49,530 --> 04:19:51,530
Yeah, we go down with the crystal thing.

4212
04:19:53,310 --> 04:19:56,190
Okay, so then they play Cyberpunk 2777 in the near future.

4213
04:19:56,830 --> 04:19:58,190
Isn't that game like super long?

4214
04:19:58,290 --> 04:19:58,930
I don't know.

4215
04:19:59,230 --> 04:20:01,050
I know like that game is incredibly long.

4216
04:20:01,070 --> 04:20:05,990
and it has like, uh, because it's basically like, uh, what's it called?

4217
04:20:06,170 --> 04:20:07,010
Oh my god, I'm hitting everything.

4218
04:20:10,990 --> 04:20:13,590
It's basically future.

4219
04:20:13,590 --> 04:20:16,790
GTA, but in the future, it's a very big open world, yeah.

4220
04:20:17,290 --> 04:20:19,610
But then you have a super chat, oh, and then you thank you.

4221
04:20:19,670 --> 04:20:22,670
Also think of a super chat Power Pro and Marie.

4222
04:20:22,930 --> 04:20:23,730
Thank you, thank you.

4223
04:20:25,130 --> 04:20:25,510
Alright.

4224
04:20:25,970 --> 04:20:26,570
Okay, here.

4225
04:20:26,910 --> 04:20:27,690
Let me do this.

4226
04:20:30,810 --> 04:20:32,390
Oh my god, I'm like, uh, I'm like Goku.

4227
04:20:32,530 --> 04:20:33,650
And flying.

4228
04:20:34,130 --> 04:20:35,170
That's super saiyan mode.

4229
04:20:35,430 --> 04:20:37,450
Oh, nice.

4230
04:20:37,950 --> 04:20:38,030
Oops.

4231
04:20:39,890 --> 04:20:40,890
We don't do that again.

4232
04:20:41,850 --> 04:20:42,490
Oh, my God.

4233
04:20:42,670 --> 04:20:43,430
We do that again.

4234
04:20:46,510 --> 04:20:47,750
Wait, secret below.

4235
04:20:50,550 --> 04:20:52,290
There's a secret room exactly below.

4236
04:20:55,470 --> 04:20:56,610
Where is it?

4237
04:20:58,550 --> 04:20:59,850
Where's the secret room?

4238
04:21:03,730 --> 04:21:04,350
Huh?

4239
04:21:05,770 --> 04:21:06,830
Oh, not yet.

4240
04:21:07,210 --> 04:21:07,210
Okay.

4241
04:21:08,410 --> 04:21:08,950
Okay, I see.

4242
04:21:09,010 --> 04:21:10,210
I know your name now, S-Ran.

4243
04:21:13,810 --> 04:21:15,030
That took you, right?

4244
04:21:15,970 --> 04:21:18,230
Now I know you're one of those one guys.

4245
04:21:23,050 --> 04:21:23,810
My head.

04:21:23,890 --> 04:21:24,410
Yeah, that's right.

Your head.

4248
04:21:25,250 --> 04:21:25,810
Your head.

4249
04:21:25,930 --> 04:21:27,010
You're on very thin.

4250
04:21:27,050 --> 04:21:27,770
That is down.

4251
04:21:30,230 --> 04:21:30,810
Oh, shit.

4252
04:21:31,370 --> 04:21:31,370
Oops.

4253
04:21:37,330 --> 04:21:37,710

Look how I went to a foster care.

4258
04:22:48,320 --> 04:22:49,300
Yeah, that's a mimic.

4259
04:22:49,740 --> 04:22:50,980
I didn't even notice it.

4260
04:22:51,080 --> 04:22:52,320
I was just like, what the fuck?

4261
04:22:53,140 --> 04:22:54,160
Why are he angry?

4262
04:22:55,500 --> 04:22:56,600
Oh, shit!

4263
04:22:58,220 --> 04:22:59,060
Fall damage isn't real.

4264
04:23:01,840 --> 04:23:02,600
It's okay.

4265
04:23:02,820 --> 04:23:05,120
Fall damage isn't real in this game.

4266
04:23:08,040 --> 04:23:09,360
Another real thing, a weapon?

4267
04:23:09,580 --> 04:23:13,440
I suppose you'll be loving me and the corpse in your wake.

4268
04:23:14,200 --> 04:23:19,800
If you won't spare thought for then, at least consider all the extra work you've forced upon those in my profession.

4269
04:23:20,440 --> 04:23:22,500
Alright, time to make him mad.

4270
04:23:23,100 --> 04:23:24,040
Inky time!

4271
04:23:24,400 --> 04:23:26,180
Oh shit, never mind, I just absorbed him.

4272
04:23:26,520 --> 04:23:28,180
Never mind, you'll never find peace.

4273
04:23:30,760 --> 04:23:31,180
Yeah.

4274
04:23:33,220 --> 04:23:33,700
What?

4275
04:23:35,880 --> 04:23:36,360
What?

4276
04:23:38,660 --> 04:23:39,140
Oh.

4277
04:23:39,580 --> 04:23:40,900
Oh, it was a cemetery.

4278
04:23:42,100 --> 04:23:42,280
Oh!

4279
04:23:44,160 --> 04:23:46,160
Oh, shit, my elevator!

4280
04:23:48,580 --> 04:23:50,480
Wait, that's my ride!

4281
04:23:51,260 --> 04:23:53,920
Oh, it comes back down.

4282
04:23:54,140 --> 04:23:54,860
Okay, nice.

4283
04:23:57,180 --> 04:23:58,480
Toki, why?

4284
04:24:01,700 --> 04:24:02,940
The murderer!

4285
04:24:03,900 --> 04:24:05,220
I thought he would fight!

4286
04:24:07,130 --> 04:24:10,390
How was I supposed to know he doesn't fight back?

4287
04:24:10,950 --> 04:24:12,950
Everybody else fought back

4288
04:24:23,770 --> 04:24:32,570
Altimore welcome to a tomato farm welcome welcome not all ghosts fight How is I supposed to know it's okay.

4289
04:24:32,790 --> 04:24:33,690
He's one inside.

4290
04:24:34,170 --> 04:24:35,310
He's inside me now.

4291
04:24:35,490 --> 04:24:35,710
It's okay.

4292
04:24:35,830 --> 04:24:36,810
He's one with me

4293
04:24:40,970 --> 04:24:51,370
Yes, my the one guy I fought was all the data I needed to know that all ghosts were bad What's that unprovoked, by the way?

4294
04:24:52,570 --> 04:24:54,010
Why, that's the key to my storeroom.

4295
04:24:54,510 --> 04:24:55,930
I thought I lost it for good.

4296
04:24:56,550 --> 04:24:58,230
Did you find it in those old mines, perhaps?

4297
04:24:58,690 --> 04:24:59,410
They're curious.

4298
04:24:59,870 --> 04:25:02,350
I have no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.

4299
04:25:02,910 --> 04:25:04,210
Very honest with you, they returned to me.

4300
04:25:04,370 --> 04:25:05,430
Yes, very kind.

4301
04:25:05,670 --> 04:25:11,170
And now that I couldn't open up my old storeroom, I can sell you some of the rare stock that's been gathering dust there.

4302
04:25:11,730 --> 04:25:15,070
These items may be a little worn, but they still retain their full market value.

4303
04:25:15,410 --> 04:25:16,370
Very precious stuff.

4304
04:25:16,550 --> 04:25:17,290
Take a look.

4305
04:25:18,270 --> 04:25:19,630
All right, elegant key.

4306
04:25:22,590 --> 04:25:24,050
I mean, that seems good.

4307
04:25:27,460 --> 04:25:29,120
I feel like I should buy the key, right?

4308
04:25:33,920 --> 04:25:36,600
Yeah, an elegant key for an elegant lock.

4309
04:25:38,800 --> 04:25:40,520
Yeah, the key seems like worth it.

4310
04:25:45,450 --> 04:25:45,950
All right.

4311
04:25:46,210 --> 04:25:46,950
We just need to save up.

4312
04:25:46,970 --> 04:25:48,430
Yeah, we got to save up for the charm stuff.

4313
04:25:49,150 --> 04:25:52,470
How was I supposed to know that he doesn't...

4314
04:25:54,710 --> 04:25:56,350
Leave and re-enter the room?

4315
04:25:56,530 --> 04:25:56,790
Okay.

4316
04:25:58,230 --> 04:26:02,490
I don't have enough money for the charm slot yet.

4317
04:26:09,010 --> 04:26:10,330
Why do I have to re-enter the shop?

4318
04:26:10,470 --> 04:26:11,250
He seems fine.

4319
04:26:13,710 --> 04:26:14,490
I don't know that.

4320
04:26:15,050 --> 04:26:17,470
Some of the older people have the experience.

4321
04:26:18,590 --> 04:26:21,190
I thought he was one of those experienced fighters.

4322
04:26:22,510 --> 04:26:23,770
I was going to fuck me up.

4323
04:26:24,750 --> 04:26:25,710
It was self-defense.

4324
04:26:26,430 --> 04:26:27,450
That old man had a gun.

4325
04:26:28,110 --> 04:26:29,110
He had a gun, guys.

4326
04:26:29,290 --> 04:26:31,230
I know you didn't see it, I saw it.

4327
04:26:37,290 --> 04:26:38,850
Alright, let's see.

4328
04:26:44,770 --> 04:26:46,410
Where was it?

4329
04:26:47,810 --> 04:26:49,230
I saw it.

4330
04:26:49,610 --> 04:26:51,270
Check the body of me.

4331
04:26:51,690 --> 04:26:52,750
Rewind the body.

4332
04:26:53,010 --> 04:26:54,190
Rewind the cameras.

4333
04:26:54,390 --> 04:26:56,030
And he had a gun.

4334
04:26:56,210 --> 04:26:57,770
It was tucked away.

4335
04:26:58,250 --> 04:26:59,130
Underneath his shell.

4336
04:26:59,270 --> 04:26:59,990
You guys didn't see it.

4337
04:27:00,150 --> 04:27:00,330
But I.

4338
04:27:00,390 --> 04:27:01,710
He had a ghost gun.

4339
04:27:02,130 --> 04:27:03,210
That was scarier.

4340
04:27:04,390 --> 04:27:06,590
I thought he would fight back.

4341
04:27:06,990 --> 04:27:10,170
We go to King Station or I guess it's King Station.

4342
04:27:11,970 --> 04:27:12,070
Yeah.

4343
04:27:14,850 --> 04:27:16,170
Where was it?

4344
04:27:16,590 --> 04:27:17,950
Where was the key area?

4345
04:27:19,430 --> 04:27:20,990
I don't really exactly remember.

4346
04:27:25,410 --> 04:27:25,450
Oh.

4347
04:27:27,030 --> 04:27:28,210
Does you guys remember?

4348
04:27:28,790 --> 04:27:29,550
I don't.

4349
04:27:31,290 --> 04:27:31,930
Oh.

4350
04:27:31,950 --> 04:27:32,990
Oh, I remember now.

4351
04:27:33,230 --> 04:27:33,950
Was it...

4352
04:27:37,410 --> 04:27:38,370
Is it...

4353
04:27:38,370 --> 04:27:39,050
This one?

4354
04:27:39,410 --> 04:27:40,250
Is this one, right?

4355
04:27:43,870 --> 04:27:44,770
Is that one?

4356
04:27:48,460 --> 04:27:49,400
That's okay, Joki.

4357
04:27:49,520 --> 04:27:50,200
I'm like the dragoons.

4358
04:27:50,340 --> 04:27:51,520
At least the ghosts ain't...

4359
04:27:51,520 --> 04:27:53,440
No, thank you for the super chat.

4360
04:27:53,520 --> 04:27:54,420
Thank you, thank you.

4361
04:27:55,860 --> 04:27:56,500
I like how...

4362
04:27:56,500 --> 04:27:57,660
I saw you, Smite!

4363
04:27:57,760 --> 04:27:58,880
I saw you said no!

4364
04:28:00,800 --> 04:28:02,880
Everyone else said yes, but you!

4365
04:28:09,640 --> 04:28:20,200

4367
04:28:35,280 --> 04:28:39,600
As if this is a church and then suddenly start stabbing.

4368
04:28:47,230 --> 04:28:48,230
You mod.

4369
04:28:48,570 --> 04:28:50,450
Oh, there was a secret room?

4370
04:28:51,070 --> 04:28:51,630
Oh, shit.

4371
04:28:51,790 --> 04:28:52,610
Give me a sec.

4372
04:28:53,410 --> 04:28:54,090
Go back.

4373
04:28:59,760 --> 04:29:01,060
Alright, it's like here.

4374
04:29:02,280 --> 04:29:02,820
Oh, shit.

4375
04:29:02,900 --> 04:29:03,600
You fought back.

4376
04:29:03,780 --> 04:29:04,160
What are you doing?

4377
04:29:04,280 --> 04:29:04,840
Fighting back.

4378
04:29:06,280 --> 04:29:08,420
You know what happens when people fight back?

4379
04:29:11,100 --> 04:29:11,800
No, Doki.

4380
04:29:12,040 --> 04:29:13,020
What happens when people fight back?

4381
04:29:13,040 --> 04:29:13,420
people.

4382
04:29:14,300 --> 04:29:14,920
It's okay.

4383
04:29:15,040 --> 04:29:15,780
You don't want to know.

4384
04:29:16,860 --> 04:29:18,090
Don't worry about it.

4385
04:29:21,600 --> 04:29:22,220
What?

4386
04:29:24,740 --> 04:29:26,360
Don't worry about it.

4387
04:29:27,120 --> 04:29:29,100
Nothing happens when they fight back.

4388
04:29:33,340 --> 04:29:33,440
Yeah.

4389
04:29:34,980 --> 04:29:36,160
Okay, there you go.

4390
04:29:36,700 --> 04:29:37,540
Where's the secret room?

4391
04:29:38,060 --> 04:29:38,400
Here?

4392
04:29:43,700 --> 04:29:45,140
What are you talking about?

4393
04:29:45,220 --> 04:29:46,740
There ain't no secret in this church.

4394
04:29:51,590 --> 04:29:53,350
Oh shit, what?

4395
04:29:56,740 --> 04:29:58,320
God, they were hiding it.

4396
04:29:58,740 --> 04:29:59,780
What what is that?

4397
04:29:59,940 --> 04:30:02,540
I don't even know what to say this is.

4398
04:30:03,000 --> 04:30:04,560
What the fuck were they hiding?

4399
04:30:06,360 --> 04:30:07,400
What was

4400
04:30:11,270 --> 04:30:11,770
that?

4401
04:30:11,970 --> 04:30:13,530
He's a rich man.

4402
04:30:13,910 --> 04:30:15,610
They were hiding a rich man

4403
04:30:20,210 --> 04:30:21,150
He's glow.

4404
04:30:21,330 --> 04:30:22,650
It's the rich grandpa.

4405
04:30:23,490 --> 04:30:26,770
Oh, so I asked why I did do a home in

4406
04:30:30,110 --> 04:30:32,930
I'm like, what even are you?

4407
04:30:36,350 --> 04:30:36,830
Wee.

4408
04:30:37,770 --> 04:30:39,930
Literally, I broke into his panic room.

4409
04:30:40,530 --> 04:30:41,370
I was like, surprise.

4410
04:30:47,300 --> 04:30:48,200
Alright, nice.

4411
04:30:56,530 --> 04:30:57,110
Oh, I can read.

4412
04:30:57,170 --> 04:30:58,470
Oh, yeah, I can read his journal.

4413
04:30:58,710 --> 04:30:59,190
You're right.

4414
04:31:01,150 --> 04:31:02,110
Wondering husk.

4415
04:31:03,410 --> 04:31:03,870
Where is he?

4416
04:31:06,530 --> 04:31:08,570
I want to read his little journal.

4417
04:31:09,210 --> 04:31:09,770
That's me.

4418
04:31:10,270 --> 04:31:11,110
That's the shade.

4419
04:31:14,170 --> 04:31:14,810
Does he even have...

4420
04:31:14,810 --> 04:31:16,210
Wait, he doesn't even have a journal.

4421
04:31:17,210 --> 04:31:18,970
He's not even that important.

4422
04:31:26,240 --> 04:31:27,380
Okay, husk dania.

4423
04:31:27,860 --> 04:31:28,560
Oh, there he is.

4424
04:31:28,680 --> 04:31:29,660
Gorgeous husk.

4425
04:31:30,280 --> 04:31:34,440
Corpulent husk, encrusted with shiny metal, retains the instinct to hordgia.

4426
04:31:34,880 --> 04:31:36,220
There's a beauty in many things.

4427
04:31:36,420 --> 04:31:37,020
Oh, yeah.

4428
04:31:37,960 --> 04:31:38,880
There he is.

4429
04:31:39,260 --> 04:31:39,800
Oh, shit.

4430
04:31:39,920 --> 04:31:40,140
Whoops.

4431
04:31:41,260 --> 04:31:42,080
Wait, is there more?

4432
04:31:44,600 --> 04:31:45,540
Is there more to him?

4433
04:31:47,020 --> 04:31:47,880
Wait, what are these?

4434
04:31:48,840 --> 04:31:52,040
Oh, yeah, they're former members of high society.

4435
04:31:52,400 --> 04:31:53,240
Yeah, I knew it.

4436
04:31:56,340 --> 04:31:57,000
I gotta say.

4437
04:31:58,360 --> 04:32:02,180
Just look at Doki, nailing all the rich both in their dreams and reality.

4438
04:32:04,600 --> 04:32:05,320
That's right.

4439
04:32:05,740 --> 04:32:07,160
I ended the bloodline.

4440
04:32:07,900 --> 04:32:09,940
I always say you gotta end the bloodline.

4441
04:32:15,340 --> 04:32:17,840
Okay, how do I get there?

4442
04:32:18,120 --> 04:32:18,240
Up!

4443
04:32:22,720 --> 04:32:23,780
Can I still go up?

4444
04:32:25,660 --> 04:32:26,280
I can't tell.

4445
04:32:26,360 --> 04:32:26,800
Yeah, I can.

4446
04:32:27,540 --> 04:32:27,600
Up.

4447
04:32:31,870 --> 04:32:33,250
Am I fully up now?

4448
04:32:33,470 --> 04:32:34,090
Okay, I am.

4449
04:32:40,500 --> 04:32:40,980
Okay.

4450
04:32:42,560 --> 04:32:46,340
I gotta figure out how to get out of here.

4451
04:32:46,440 --> 04:32:47,640
Your life doesn't matter.

4452
04:32:48,040 --> 04:32:49,280
I killed an old man.

4453
04:32:53,930 --> 04:32:55,470
Where is it?

4454
04:32:57,110 --> 04:32:58,790
Where's the other section I had to go?

4455
04:32:59,710 --> 04:33:00,010
Yeah?

4456
04:33:00,790 --> 04:33:01,510
Wait, no.

4457
04:33:02,270 --> 04:33:03,390
Oh no, I forgot.

4458
04:33:03,990 --> 04:33:04,510
I forgot.

4459
04:33:04,910 --> 04:33:06,070
Oh, it's here.

4460
04:33:06,690 --> 04:33:07,750
The escalator's right here.

4461
04:33:08,270 --> 04:33:09,730
Wait, how the fuck do I get there?

4462
04:33:11,150 --> 04:33:13,370
Oh my god, I actually forgot how to do this.

4463
04:33:15,090 --> 04:33:16,230
Let's let...

4464
04:33:16,230 --> 04:33:17,990
Because I can't go up from here.

4465
04:33:19,490 --> 04:33:20,990
Oh my god.

4466
04:33:21,530 --> 04:33:22,350
I'm lost.

4467
04:33:24,290 --> 04:33:25,730
Is it here?

4468
04:33:28,950 --> 04:33:29,790
Maybe it's here.

4469
04:33:30,110 --> 04:33:30,170
No.

4470
04:33:31,470 --> 04:33:32,590
How the fuck?

4471
04:33:32,750 --> 04:33:33,770
How do I get there?

4472
04:33:35,290 --> 04:33:36,790
Down to the right then.

4473
04:33:37,590 --> 04:33:38,490
Oh, it's up here.

4474
04:33:38,710 --> 04:33:39,830
JK, I figured it out.

4475
04:33:40,590 --> 04:33:41,450
All by myself.

4476
04:33:44,030 --> 04:33:45,350
No help whatsoever.

4477
04:33:47,510 --> 04:33:48,510
Oh, whoops.

4478
04:33:50,950 --> 04:33:52,010
Oh, shit.

4479
04:33:52,570 --> 04:33:52,630
Okay.

4480
04:33:52,930 --> 04:33:53,690
Give me my house.

4481
04:33:53,830 --> 04:33:54,550
Elevator up.

4482
04:33:55,570 --> 04:33:56,750
Yeah, it's still time.

4483
04:33:57,270 --> 04:33:58,210
Oh my god, I said up.

4484
04:34:02,590 --> 04:34:03,330
Okay, there we go.

4485
04:34:07,250 --> 04:34:08,150
Okay, this way.

4486
04:34:10,270 --> 04:34:11,070
And then...

4487
04:34:11,070 --> 04:34:12,130
Oh my god, shit.

4488
04:34:12,770 --> 04:34:13,790
Okay, this way.

4489
04:34:20,360 --> 04:34:21,120
Oh my god.

4490
04:34:21,380 --> 04:34:22,220
Oh, wait, no.

4491
04:34:22,500 --> 04:34:23,180
It is this way.

4492
04:34:23,820 --> 04:34:24,820
Oh my god.

4493
04:34:26,060 --> 04:34:26,160
God damn it.

4494
04:34:26,860 --> 04:34:29,180
I was like telling him, I was like, wait, is this?

4495
04:34:29,260 --> 04:34:29,740
this way?

4496
04:34:30,420 --> 04:34:31,900
I made a shortcut here.

4497
04:34:33,140 --> 04:34:34,280
Now it's this way.

4498
04:34:36,280 --> 04:34:37,520
Okay, now we got it.

4499
04:34:38,420 --> 04:34:39,380
We did it.

4500
04:34:40,820 --> 04:34:41,860
We figured it out.

4501
04:34:42,200 --> 04:34:44,200
It took me forever, but we figured it out.

4502
04:34:46,260 --> 04:34:48,720
Yes, an elegant key for an elegant door.

4503
04:34:51,100 --> 04:34:53,200
Yeah, broke into Grandpa's panic room.

4504
04:34:54,960 --> 04:34:55,680
Oh, shit!

4505
04:34:55,860 --> 04:34:56,660
What the fuck?

4506
04:34:57,700 --> 04:34:59,240
Oh, my God, it's this guy again.

4507
04:34:59,260 --> 04:34:59,540
again.

4508
04:35:00,540 --> 04:35:01,620
Oh my god, I hate this guy.

4509
04:35:02,040 --> 04:35:03,480
I hate this guy so much.

4510
04:35:05,180 --> 04:35:06,380
I forgot how much I hate him.

4511
04:35:07,340 --> 04:35:08,120
Oh my god.

4512
04:35:09,080 --> 04:35:10,680
I think I might actually die to this guy, though.

4513
04:35:12,280 --> 04:35:13,540
I forgot how to fight him.

4514
04:35:16,460 --> 04:35:18,140
Oh my god, I actually forgot how to fight this guy.

4515
04:35:24,020 --> 04:35:24,420
No!

4516
04:35:25,180 --> 04:35:25,400
Ah!

4517
04:35:36,070 --> 04:35:36,870
I forgot!

4518
04:35:37,390 --> 04:35:37,790
Oh!

4519
04:35:38,210 --> 04:35:39,650
Shit, where am I?

4520
04:35:39,850 --> 04:35:40,030
Okay.

4521
04:35:40,930 --> 04:35:45,110
All right, I guess where's this fucking bus stop again?

4522
04:35:45,450 --> 04:35:47,290
Oh my God.

4523
04:35:47,710 --> 04:35:50,250
I'm all the way here.

4524
04:35:53,270 --> 04:35:56,050
I forgot to take that bench.

4525
04:35:56,950 --> 04:35:58,650
How do I get back?

4526
04:36:01,030 --> 04:36:02,790
Okay, it's this way.

4527
04:36:04,750 --> 04:36:06,070
Streamer, what?

4528
04:36:08,470 --> 04:36:10,190
Okay, it's this way.

4529
04:36:10,950 --> 04:36:12,230
I was gonna charge up.

4530
04:36:12,450 --> 04:36:14,250
I forgot about the bench, guys.

4531
04:36:15,390 --> 04:36:16,770
I didn't bench.

4532
04:36:16,890 --> 04:36:19,550
I didn't think it'd be a boss fight!

4533
04:36:21,850 --> 04:36:24,370
Oh my god, I gotta do this again.

4534
04:36:27,350 --> 04:36:30,010
I didn't think it was a boss fight.

4535
04:36:33,310 --> 04:36:36,270
I thought it was just chilling with the homies.

4536
04:36:38,710 --> 04:36:40,990
Oh my god.

4537
04:36:42,430 --> 04:36:44,130
It's so far.

4538
04:36:49,070 --> 04:36:50,930
Because I didn't know.

4539
04:36:53,980 --> 04:36:54,900
I wasn't ready.

4540
04:36:56,060 --> 04:37:00,540
Okay, let's heal in this bench first before I do anything.

4541
04:37:01,340 --> 04:37:04,100
So at least that kills half the time.

4542
04:37:06,140 --> 04:37:08,440
I wasn't locked in.

4543
04:37:09,380 --> 04:37:10,560
All of crap.

4544
04:37:11,120 --> 04:37:11,760
Don't worry.

4545
04:37:12,700 --> 04:37:15,240
We'll get Grandpa's money back.

4546
04:37:20,410 --> 04:37:23,790
Sack the storerooms for a quicker travel.

4547
04:37:23,950 --> 04:37:24,930
Where's the storerooms?

4548
04:37:25,150 --> 04:37:26,290
I don't even remember.

4549
04:37:28,110 --> 04:37:29,670
I don't even remember.

4550
04:37:34,500 --> 04:37:35,900
I miss sword.

4551
04:37:36,120 --> 04:37:37,460
Where the fuck is the storeroom?

4552
04:37:37,620 --> 04:37:38,480
That's faster?

4553
04:37:45,240 --> 04:37:46,940
Where is this?

4554
04:37:48,100 --> 04:37:49,220
How is that?

4555
04:37:49,340 --> 04:37:50,700
Oh, I guess it is faster.

4556
04:37:51,080 --> 04:37:51,840
This is faster.

4557
04:37:51,960 --> 04:37:52,980
I'm gonna rest here.

4558
04:37:54,580 --> 04:37:56,580
Keyframe, we hitting 60 hours for sure.

4559
04:37:56,960 --> 04:37:57,260
Chats, no.

4560
04:37:57,500 --> 04:37:59,000
Thank you for the super chat.

4561
04:37:59,300 --> 04:38:00,520
Thank you, thank you.

4562
04:38:00,520 --> 04:38:02,300
I didn't know.

4563
04:38:05,380 --> 04:38:05,880
Alright.

4564
04:38:07,640 --> 04:38:10,080
And then we go right.

4565
04:38:11,420 --> 04:38:12,700
All the way right.

4566
04:38:15,340 --> 04:38:15,980
We...

4567
04:38:15,980 --> 04:38:17,280
Oh wait, I have a tree here.

4568
04:38:17,620 --> 04:38:17,860
Ow.

4569
04:38:18,180 --> 04:38:19,360
Okay, that was...

4570
04:38:19,360 --> 04:38:20,140
Not there.

4571
04:38:21,080 --> 04:38:23,080
I remember there was a tree here.

4572
04:38:24,520 --> 04:38:25,020
Here?

4573
04:38:25,500 --> 04:38:26,520
Oh, there it is.

4574
04:38:28,380 --> 04:38:30,520
That's where I can bait it.

4575
04:38:34,140 --> 04:38:34,340
Alright.

4576
04:38:35,520 --> 04:38:35,880
Tree!

4577
04:38:37,800 --> 04:38:39,700
Oh my god, it's so far.

4578
04:38:43,280 --> 04:38:45,240
Wait, do I have to hit the tree again?

4579
04:38:45,640 --> 04:38:47,160
To like, um...

4580
04:38:47,160 --> 04:38:53,800
If I don't get all of the essence uh, from that tree, And I just leave it?

4581
04:38:54,400 --> 04:38:55,540
Do I have to get it again?

4582
04:38:56,960 --> 04:38:57,680
I'm curious.

4583
04:39:01,750 --> 04:39:03,170
Like, do I have to hit the tree?

4584
04:39:07,150 --> 04:39:08,430
Oh my god, get me out of here.

4585
04:39:08,770 --> 04:39:10,330
Yes, yes, but not all of it?

4586
04:39:10,450 --> 04:39:10,650
Okay.

4587
04:39:11,410 --> 04:39:13,150
Just whichever one I didn't do.

4588
04:39:14,530 --> 04:39:16,210
Whichever one I just didn't receive.

4589
04:39:18,690 --> 04:39:19,070
Where am I?

4590
04:39:19,410 --> 04:39:19,750
Where am I?

4591
04:39:22,190 --> 04:39:23,790
I'm like, where am I flying to?

4592
04:39:24,910 --> 04:39:25,810
Eh, fuck it.

4593
04:39:25,850 --> 04:39:26,830
I don't really care that much.

4594
04:39:27,010 --> 04:39:27,610
I'm just gonna leave.

4595
04:39:28,450 --> 04:39:28,450
Goodbye.

4596
04:39:34,140 --> 04:39:37,060
Okay, then I just go straight to the right.

4597
04:39:42,720 --> 04:39:44,660
Don't worry, Goku's coming over.

4598
04:39:45,840 --> 04:39:46,500
Damn it.

4599
04:39:49,500 --> 04:39:50,620
What the fuck?

4600
04:39:51,120 --> 04:39:53,360
I popped and then the other guy was like, no!

4601
04:39:54,540 --> 04:39:55,000
Bad!

4602
04:39:56,440 --> 04:39:56,900
Alright.

4603
04:40:00,200 --> 04:40:03,380
Okay, now I'll lock in, I think.

4604
04:40:04,220 --> 04:40:04,700
I don't know.

4605
04:40:04,880 --> 04:40:06,000
Most likely not.

4606
04:40:17,350 --> 04:40:18,130
My god!

4607
04:40:18,690 --> 04:40:19,810
Oh my god!

4608
04:40:20,130 --> 04:40:20,990
Oh my god!

4609
04:40:21,070 --> 04:40:21,790
I'm not locking in.

4610
04:40:21,830 --> 04:40:22,790
I'm not locking in.

4611
04:40:28,510 --> 04:40:30,630
I literally forgot how to fight this guy.

4612
04:40:30,830 --> 04:40:31,610
I'm just gonna say it.

4613
04:40:32,030 --> 04:40:33,490
I don't remember how to fight him.

4614
04:40:41,700 --> 04:40:42,260
Please!

4615
04:40:46,740 --> 04:40:47,720
I hate him.

4616
04:40:47,860 --> 04:40:49,020
I hate him.

4617
04:40:53,100 --> 04:40:54,520
I forgot to sit on the bench!

4618
04:40:54,820 --> 04:40:56,180
I forgot to sit on the other bench.

4619
04:40:56,640 --> 04:40:58,920
I have to go all the way there.

4620
04:40:59,620 --> 04:41:02,740
I forgot to sit on the other bench.

4621
04:41:03,220 --> 04:41:07,580
I just realized there was another bench that I didn't sit at.

4622
04:41:08,140 --> 04:41:09,340
Oh my god.

4623
04:41:10,040 --> 04:41:15,780
I was not struggling in any other bosses, but yet I struggle with- I hate magic users.

4624
04:41:16,060 --> 04:41:16,720
I hate mages.

4625
04:41:16,860 --> 04:41:18,040
I hate them so much.

4626
04:41:22,580 --> 04:41:24,760
I hate magic users.

4627
04:41:26,800 --> 04:41:27,180
Okay.

4628
04:41:28,440 --> 04:41:29,160

4630
04:41:34,060 --> 04:41:37,720

Leave!

4640
04:42:58,380 --> 04:43:00,160
Your kindness and welcome here.

4641
04:43:01,500 --> 04:43:02,100
What's this?

4642
04:43:03,820 --> 04:43:05,460
A figure connected to...

4643
04:43:05,480 --> 04:43:06,380
To a device.

4644
04:43:06,820 --> 04:43:09,640
Okay, um, let me open this first before I do it.

4645
04:43:10,000 --> 04:43:10,980
All right, yes.

4646
04:43:13,720 --> 04:43:14,160
Hello?

4647
04:43:17,360 --> 04:43:18,720
Don't be toxic.

4648
04:43:19,100 --> 04:43:20,280
Just take the W.

4649
04:43:21,060 --> 04:43:22,300
It's not the same.

4650
04:43:23,340 --> 04:43:26,680
Tap to the spell consumes the same amount.

4651
04:43:27,700 --> 04:43:27,940
What?

4652
04:43:30,440 --> 04:43:31,880
Oh, Shadesa.

4653
04:43:32,220 --> 04:43:32,840
Is that better?

4654
04:43:33,940 --> 04:43:34,660
Stupid nerd.

4655
04:43:34,720 --> 04:43:35,460
Nerds aren't welcome here.

4656
04:43:35,480 --> 04:43:36,960
This is not a safe space for this nerd.

4657
04:43:38,240 --> 04:43:39,760
This exact nerd, though.

4658
04:43:39,840 --> 04:43:41,260
Only this particular nerd.

4659
04:43:44,920 --> 04:43:45,180
Alright.

4660
04:43:45,800 --> 04:43:47,000
Oh, I upgraded Fireball.

4661
04:43:48,040 --> 04:43:48,560
Fireball.

4662
04:43:51,020 --> 04:43:52,520
Okay, where do I go now?

4663
04:43:58,720 --> 04:43:59,860
No, it doesn't count.

4664
04:44:00,540 --> 04:44:01,480
I'm different.

4665
04:44:05,270 --> 04:44:06,690
Oh, it's double the damage?

4666
04:44:06,870 --> 04:44:07,170
Nice.

4667
04:44:10,760 --> 04:44:11,460

Good morning!

4676
04:45:07,410 --> 04:45:08,290
Good morning, Morgan.

04:45:11,170 --> 04:45:12,610
Oh, what about this guy?

4678
04:45:18,210 --> 04:45:18,690
Alright.

4679
04:45:19,550 --> 04:45:21,030
I needed her soul anyway.

4680
04:45:24,250 --> 04:45:27,130
All right, take me to the king's station.

4681
04:45:27,490 --> 04:45:27,910
Ring ring.

4682
04:45:36,520 --> 04:45:38,680
All right, this way we go.

4683
04:45:39,220 --> 04:45:39,680
Oh, shit.

4684
04:45:41,460 --> 04:45:43,760
Let me sit on the bench just in case.

4685
04:45:46,200 --> 04:45:50,780
After everything we've been through, I'm just gonna make sure we have a bench.

4686
04:45:55,470 --> 04:45:56,010
Okay.

4687
04:45:57,230 --> 04:45:58,670
Not worth killing these guys.

4688
04:45:58,950 --> 04:46:00,630
These guys are like...

4689
04:46:00,630 --> 04:46:03,010
Like, these guys barely give me any money.

4690
04:46:03,930 --> 04:46:04,280
money.

4691
04:46:06,970 --> 04:46:07,990
Oh, whoops.

4692
04:46:08,790 --> 04:46:14,150
Uh, okay, ancient basin is right here.

4693
04:46:15,310 --> 04:46:18,270
Wee, oops, wee.

4694
04:46:19,050 --> 04:46:21,030
Wee, wee.

4695
04:46:21,750 --> 04:46:21,970
Ow.

4696
04:46:22,810 --> 04:46:24,050
Okay, that's fine.

4697
04:46:24,630 --> 04:46:25,030
Wee.

4698
04:46:25,190 --> 04:46:25,590
Oh, shit.

4699
04:46:25,770 --> 04:46:26,330
Wee.

4700
04:46:27,810 --> 04:46:28,530
All right, nice.

4701
04:46:28,670 --> 04:46:29,510
We made it.

4702
04:46:29,670 --> 04:46:29,990
All right.

4703
04:46:33,910 --> 04:46:35,570
Here we go, here.

4704
04:46:36,810 --> 04:46:37,510
I don't remember.

4705
04:46:38,910 --> 04:46:40,270
Oh, it's this way.

4706
04:46:44,230 --> 04:46:46,470
Oh, it's the creepy bugs.

4707
04:46:47,890 --> 04:46:49,010
These guys.

4708
04:46:51,110 --> 04:46:53,790
Oh my god, fuck off.

4709
04:46:58,730 --> 04:46:59,150
Okay.

4710
04:47:00,590 --> 04:47:02,190
Got a heal real quick.

4711
04:47:03,330 --> 04:47:04,910
I killed all your friends and your sister.

4712
04:47:04,930 --> 04:47:06,250
Still coming over here?

4713
04:47:07,190 --> 04:47:08,950
And then we drop from here.

4714
04:47:13,120 --> 04:47:13,760
Wee!

4715
04:47:13,820 --> 04:47:14,000
Oh.

4716
04:47:15,440 --> 04:47:19,720
Alright, now we're in the ancient Basin or whatever.

4717
04:47:21,600 --> 04:47:22,420
Ancient Basin.

4718
04:47:25,000 --> 04:47:26,360
It's this way, right?

4719
04:47:27,060 --> 04:47:28,680
No, this wasn't it.

4720
04:47:29,220 --> 04:47:30,560
Where the fuck was it?

4721
04:47:32,100 --> 04:47:34,020
Guys, which way do we go?

4722
04:47:39,420 --> 04:47:40,100
Oh!

4723
04:47:40,260 --> 04:47:41,520
Wrong way.

4724
04:47:41,620 --> 04:47:42,160
I remember.

4725
04:47:42,880 --> 04:47:44,780
It's a bench from down there.

4726
04:47:45,140 --> 04:47:45,280
Right?

4727
04:47:45,880 --> 04:47:46,400
Yeah.

4728
04:47:49,380 --> 04:47:50,280
Okay, we gotta go down.

4729
04:47:54,580 --> 04:47:56,620
Okay, and then...

4730
04:47:56,620 --> 04:47:57,260
This way.

4731
04:47:58,680 --> 04:47:59,720
Down, down we go.

4732
04:47:59,920 --> 04:48:01,540
And then...

4733
04:48:01,540 --> 04:48:03,900
And then we do our dash.

4734
04:48:05,200 --> 04:48:05,780
Alright, nice.

4735
04:48:06,440 --> 04:48:07,000
That's a point.

4736
04:48:11,040 --> 04:48:36,110

4738
04:48:42,090 --> 04:48:42,970
What is that?

4739
04:48:44,610 --> 04:48:45,710
Why did y'all run away?

4740
04:48:47,690 --> 04:48:49,130
I'm not a bad person.

4741
04:48:49,570 --> 04:48:50,490
I'm not awful good.

4742
04:48:51,590 --> 04:48:52,730
Why did they run away?

4743
04:48:57,540 --> 04:48:58,000
Hello?

4744
04:49:03,930 --> 04:49:04,830
What's that?

4745
04:49:06,330 --> 04:49:08,370
Oh shit, what the fuck is that?

4746
04:49:12,940 --> 04:49:13,960
Okay, there you go.

4747
04:49:14,740 --> 04:49:15,800
Yeah, I just blasted.

4748
04:49:16,100 --> 04:49:17,140
It was too far away.

4749
04:49:17,800 --> 04:49:19,520
Too much work to get close to that.

4750
04:49:22,480 --> 04:49:23,900
Yeah, why would they run away?

4751
04:49:24,060 --> 04:49:27,700
Have they not heard about all the cool things I've did for society?

4752
04:49:28,240 --> 04:49:29,080
For bug society?

4753
04:49:34,310 --> 04:49:35,630
I don't know.

4754
04:49:36,670 --> 04:49:38,090
I'm just gonna leave.

4755
04:49:44,260 --> 04:49:45,780

Oh, fuck, okay.

4759
04:50:27,250 --> 04:50:28,730
Oh my god, I'm going this way.

4760
04:50:37,020 --> 04:50:37,240
Oh.

4761
04:50:38,360 --> 04:50:39,620
Simple key.

4762
04:50:42,880 --> 04:50:43,720
Let's...

4763
04:50:43,720 --> 04:50:44,060
Whoa.

4764
04:50:54,780 --> 04:50:56,120
Okay, that's good.

4765
04:50:56,560 --> 04:50:57,500
I got one.

4766
04:50:58,940 --> 04:51:00,000
Slow and steady.

4767
04:51:02,100 --> 04:51:03,600
I'll take those.

4768
04:51:05,060 --> 04:51:06,260
I'll take those.

4769
04:51:06,280 --> 04:51:07,380
I got another one.

4770
04:51:07,980 --> 04:51:09,000
I got another one.

4771
04:51:09,600 --> 04:51:10,460
I hit a run.

4772
04:51:13,540 --> 04:51:14,300
Don't worry, I can grab him.

4773
04:51:14,440 --> 04:51:15,380
I can grab another hit.

4774
04:51:15,700 --> 04:51:16,580
There we go.

4775
04:51:17,400 --> 04:51:18,280
Baby steps.

4776
04:51:20,000 --> 04:51:20,660
Oh, fuck.

4777
04:51:21,260 --> 04:51:22,040
I got that greedy.

4778
04:51:23,340 --> 04:51:24,700
It got delayed.

4779
04:51:26,600 --> 04:51:28,200
That shit was delayed.

4780
04:51:30,000 --> 04:51:30,820
There we go.

4781
04:51:33,700 --> 04:51:34,280
Nice.

4782
04:51:35,060 --> 04:51:35,780
We're okay.

4783
04:51:41,190 --> 04:51:42,630
Are you serious?

4784
04:51:42,930 --> 04:51:43,970
That was supposed to be a pogo.

4785
04:51:44,710 --> 04:51:45,850
I don't know why I didn't pogo there.

4786
04:51:51,750 --> 04:51:52,670
Not as bad.

4787
04:51:56,320 --> 04:51:59,400
Okay, now I should be able to abuse magic here.

4788
04:52:03,640 --> 04:52:05,400
Oh my god, I hate this guy.

4789
04:52:09,680 --> 04:52:09,960
Okay.

4790
04:52:11,260 --> 04:52:12,420
Got the strong fiber.

4791
04:52:13,920 --> 04:52:14,220
Alright.

4792
04:52:16,220 --> 04:52:17,400
Okay, we did it.

4793
04:52:18,340 --> 04:52:20,020
Okay, I can be full HP too.

4794
04:52:20,980 --> 04:52:22,740
Alright, I think I figured out this pattern.

4795
04:52:22,880 --> 04:52:23,600
I figured out this pattern.

4796
04:52:24,180 --> 04:52:26,000
So it should be, like, easier.

4797
04:52:26,120 --> 04:52:27,380
Oh my god, GoSchool.

4798
04:52:29,540 --> 04:52:30,520
Okay, but where's over?

4799
04:52:30,720 --> 04:52:31,720
What's over here?

4800
04:52:32,300 --> 04:52:32,880
Okay, nothing.

4801
04:52:34,800 --> 04:52:36,180
Now there's GoSchool?

4802
04:52:38,060 --> 04:52:39,740
What did I do to you?

4803
04:52:49,800 --> 04:52:53,300
It's not my fault your children were just running in the open.

4804
04:52:54,100 --> 04:52:56,260
It's like they were begging to get...

4805
04:52:56,400 --> 04:52:57,180
Snashed.

4806
04:52:58,000 --> 04:52:59,280
You get shanked.

4807
04:53:01,160 --> 04:53:01,480
Right.

4808
04:53:04,990 --> 04:53:07,630
Why would they run in front of a stranger with a knife?

4809
04:53:08,770 --> 04:53:09,130
Huh?

4810
04:53:09,590 --> 04:53:10,510
That's their fault.

4811
04:53:12,250 --> 04:53:13,330
Okay, what's over here?

4812
04:53:18,130 --> 04:53:19,410
Jesus, toky.

4813
04:53:21,050 --> 04:53:21,690
What?

4814
04:53:22,070 --> 04:53:23,250
What did I do?

4815
04:53:25,390 --> 04:53:27,850
I'm just protecting us from all the other ghosts.

4816
04:53:28,050 --> 04:53:29,070
From the go school.

4817
04:53:30,710 --> 04:53:31,450
What's that?

4818
04:53:34,910 --> 04:53:35,270
Hello?

4819
04:53:39,840 --> 04:53:40,780
Am I supposed to...

4820
04:53:40,780 --> 04:53:41,320
Oh, shit.

4821
04:53:43,980 --> 04:53:44,680
Wait, what the hell?

4822
04:53:45,120 --> 04:53:45,740
Wait, no, no.

4823
04:53:45,820 --> 04:53:46,340
Stop, children.

4824
04:53:46,500 --> 04:53:46,680
Stop.

4825
04:53:46,840 --> 04:53:46,960
Stop.

4826
04:53:47,080 --> 04:53:47,640
It was just a joke.

4827
04:53:47,960 --> 04:53:47,960
Children.

4828
04:53:48,140 --> 04:53:48,320
Stop.

4829
04:53:48,720 --> 04:53:49,020
Get out.

4830
04:53:49,100 --> 04:53:49,500
Get out.

4831
04:53:51,800 --> 04:53:52,560
Oh, no.

4832
04:53:53,580 --> 04:53:54,340
Oh, no.

4833
04:53:55,360 --> 04:53:56,520
I swear it was a joke.

4834
04:53:56,800 --> 04:53:57,620
Oh, my God.

4835
04:53:58,080 --> 04:53:59,200
Oh, they're fighting back.

4836
04:54:02,900 --> 04:54:06,340
The goo, I repeat, the goo is fighting back.

4837
04:54:11,820 --> 04:54:14,060
Oh my god, I can't even hit him.

4838
04:54:15,380 --> 04:54:16,760
I can't even hit him.

4839
04:54:17,080 --> 04:54:18,180
He's so fast.

4840
04:54:19,460 --> 04:54:21,360
Like, I don't know his patterns.

4841
04:54:26,610 --> 04:54:27,430
Holy shit.

4842
04:54:28,030 --> 04:54:29,230
I don't understand.

4843
04:54:29,890 --> 04:54:31,170
I actually don't understand.

4844
04:54:34,190 --> 04:54:35,070
Oh my god.

4845
04:54:43,660 --> 04:54:44,860
Oh my god, I can't.

4846
04:54:44,880 --> 04:54:47,520

Please let me heal.

4850
04:55:44,490 --> 04:55:44,710
Let me heal.

4851
04:55:44,930 --> 04:55:45,410
Oh, I did it.

4852
04:55:45,430 --> 04:55:45,710
First try.

4853
04:55:45,830 --> 04:55:46,450
Let's go.

4854
04:55:46,830 --> 04:55:47,870
Oh, first try.

4855
04:55:48,090 --> 04:55:48,370
Yeah.

4856
04:55:53,830 --> 04:55:54,510
Oh, my God.

4857
04:55:54,550 --> 04:55:55,390
That was so stressful.

4858
04:55:55,890 --> 04:55:56,970
That was so stressful.

4859
04:55:58,730 --> 04:56:00,350
I felt like I could never heal.

4860
04:56:01,510 --> 04:56:02,030
Yeah, first try.

4861
04:56:02,270 --> 04:56:02,510
Let's go.

4862
04:56:02,690 --> 04:56:03,310
Another first try.

4863
04:56:04,090 --> 04:56:07,190
I swear, I died to like mini bosses and not like actual bosses.

4864
04:56:11,650 --> 04:56:17,610
Oh, I can dream now that Whoops Well, I cannot Cat anymore No

4865
04:56:22,570 --> 04:56:25,450
Well, will he still be there, guys?

4866
04:56:25,990 --> 04:56:29,150
Will he still be there?

4867
04:56:31,530 --> 04:56:33,510
Wait, okay, okay

4868
04:56:37,910 --> 04:56:42,950
Alright, okay, he'll still be there Okay, cool Hey, cool.

4869
04:56:43,790 --> 04:56:43,790
Whoops.

4870
04:56:47,430 --> 04:56:49,590
Well, a corpse doesn't move.

4871
04:56:50,810 --> 04:56:51,530
I don't know.

4872
04:56:51,650 --> 04:56:55,210
I thought maybe, like, the ghoul would take him or some shit.

4873
04:56:55,990 --> 04:56:58,010
The ghoul would fucking transport him.

4874
04:56:58,610 --> 04:56:59,350
Or is this double jump?

4875
04:57:00,810 --> 04:57:01,770
Monarch wings.

4876
04:57:02,130 --> 04:57:02,290
Yeah.

4877
04:57:03,310 --> 04:57:03,950
Oh, nice.

4879
04:57:08,880 --> 04:57:09,480
Oh, wait.

4880
04:57:09,480 --> 04:57:09,960
I can get it.

4881
04:57:09,960 --> 04:57:10,860
I can go back now.

4882
04:57:11,120 --> 04:57:12,080
Okay, well, I'll go back.

4883
04:57:14,000 --> 04:57:15,960
and sordid him.

4884
04:57:19,320 --> 04:57:20,220
Okay, now I can.

4885
04:57:21,120 --> 04:57:21,540
Yay!

4886
04:57:21,860 --> 04:57:22,480
Double jump.

4887
04:57:24,220 --> 04:57:25,140
Are you still there?

4888
04:57:25,740 --> 04:57:26,840
Are you still there?

4889
04:57:30,120 --> 04:57:31,320
Dream time!

4890
04:57:32,880 --> 04:57:34,080
Wait, where am I?

4891
04:57:34,980 --> 04:57:36,020
Wait a minute.

4892
04:57:37,400 --> 04:57:37,760
Hello?

4893
04:57:44,080 --> 04:57:44,880
Wait.

4894
04:57:45,400 --> 04:57:46,360
Where am I?

4895
04:57:49,600 --> 04:57:50,840
Where Where did I go?

4896
04:57:52,280 --> 04:57:54,260
Why am I here?

4897
04:57:54,940 --> 04:57:55,240
Hello?

4898
04:57:56,620 --> 04:57:57,700
How did I get here?

4899
04:58:02,990 --> 04:58:04,690
I don't like this area.

4900
04:58:10,090 --> 04:58:11,110
Why am I here?

4901
04:58:12,450 --> 04:58:15,090
Oh my god, I just killed you!

4902
04:58:16,110 --> 04:58:17,350
This is not fair.

4903
04:58:17,990 --> 04:58:19,590
You were supposed to be dead!

4904
04:58:21,550 --> 04:58:22,890
Oh my god!

4905
04:58:23,390 --> 04:58:25,870
Excuse me, why are you still here?

4906
04:58:26,870 --> 04:58:28,870
Oh my god, I'm getting hit by everything.

4907
04:58:32,450 --> 04:58:33,270
Oh my god.

4908
04:58:33,750 --> 04:58:34,270
Oh my god.

4909
04:58:34,550 --> 04:58:35,570
Oh my god.

4910
04:58:35,790 --> 04:58:38,230
I was not supposed to be here.

4911
04:58:46,930 --> 04:58:49,190
Oh my god, I was going to die anyway.

4912
04:58:49,330 --> 04:58:50,650
Yeah, we're not first trying this.

4913
04:58:50,970 --> 04:58:52,690
We're not first trying this.

4914
04:58:53,510 --> 04:58:56,050
Okay, I think I can kill him though.

4915
04:58:56,270 --> 04:58:57,190
We'll dream him again.

4916
04:59:01,710 --> 04:59:03,710
I think we can kill him.

4917
04:59:07,390 --> 04:59:09,730
Well, I got greedy.

4918
04:59:10,090 --> 04:59:12,030
I was like, I can just fall down.

4919
04:59:16,560 --> 04:59:17,460
I keep my stuff.

4920
04:59:17,580 --> 04:59:18,320
Oh, wait.

4921
04:59:19,100 --> 04:59:20,100

04:59:20,580 --> 04:59:21,300
That's nice.

4923
04:59:23,800 --> 04:59:24,100
Okay.

4924
04:59:24,700 --> 04:59:25,760
I keep everything.

4925
04:59:25,880 --> 04:59:26,520
I didn't know that.

4926
04:59:33,460 --> 04:59:34,160
Oh, what the...

04:59:34,160 --> 04:59:36,660

Okay.

4936
05:00:48,760 --> 05:00:50,940
Okay, we can do this.

4937
05:00:52,920 --> 05:00:55,320
He's incredibly fast.

4938
05:00:56,460 --> 05:00:58,460
No, I'm- I can do this.

4939
05:00:59,720 --> 05:01:00,640
I can do this.

4940
05:01:03,280 --> 05:01:04,740
I think I can.

4941
05:01:06,380 --> 05:01:07,580
I'm a gamer.

4942
05:01:08,420 --> 05:01:11,060
I know he definitely It definitely seems really difficult.

4943
05:01:14,400 --> 05:01:19,120
It's like, because for me, I'm not used to, like, how fast he is.

4944
05:01:20,960 --> 05:01:24,320
Like, I never remember, like, his movesets, too.

4945
05:01:27,000 --> 05:01:29,700
Like, because, like, I was playing his other movesets, so...

4946
05:01:30,840 --> 05:01:33,820
Because of that, I'm not used to, like, how much faster he is now.

4947
05:01:34,180 --> 05:01:36,080
These blobs are very annoying, too.

4948
05:01:40,860 --> 05:01:41,980
Oh my god.

4949
05:01:47,840 --> 05:01:49,000
These blobs are very annoying.

4950
05:01:50,580 --> 05:01:51,560
Oh, fuck.

4951
05:01:52,320 --> 05:01:53,620
I got the first stagger.

4952
05:01:54,200 --> 05:01:55,540
How many staggers does he have?

4953
05:01:59,260 --> 05:02:00,920
How many staggers does this guy have?

4954
05:02:06,210 --> 05:02:07,250
Three staggers?

4955
05:02:07,350 --> 05:02:07,590
Okay.

4956
05:02:11,230 --> 05:02:13,590
I'm just trying to speedrun going down.

4957
05:02:14,790 --> 05:02:15,310
Okay, yeah.

4958
05:02:17,790 --> 05:02:21,910
Okay, I just want to know how many staggers So I got to the first one, so that's already pretty good.

4959
05:02:24,210 --> 05:02:26,970
When he does that, it's so annoying, actually.

4960
05:02:27,770 --> 05:02:29,710
Like, because he lands straight on me, too.

4961
05:02:30,650 --> 05:02:31,630
Which is very annoying.

4962
05:02:38,760 --> 05:02:39,560
Jesus Christ.

4963
05:02:39,680 --> 05:02:40,760
I don't even think I can get a heal.

4964
05:02:41,500 --> 05:02:43,520
Yeah, I definitely can't get a heal for this.

4965
05:02:44,120 --> 05:02:45,660
I can't heal for this, yeah.

4966
05:02:46,380 --> 05:02:46,960
And see that?

4967
05:02:47,040 --> 05:02:48,840
And you can give you an extra edge to beat him.

4968
05:02:48,920 --> 05:02:50,080

05:05:25,100 --> 05:05:27,300
Oh my god, that was close.

4985
05:05:28,080 --> 05:05:29,080
Stupid!

4986
05:05:31,920 --> 05:05:32,920
Fucking...

4987
05:05:32,920 --> 05:05:33,320
Okay.

4988
05:05:33,920 --> 05:05:34,480
Nice.

4989
05:05:41,920 --> 05:05:43,120
I got fucked over.

4990
05:05:44,900 --> 05:05:46,100
I got fucked over so bad.

4991
05:05:46,780 --> 05:05:49,180
Oh my god, I got fucked over so bad.

4992
05:05:49,760 --> 05:05:52,160
Oh, I just got RNGed.

4993
05:05:53,440 --> 05:05:56,400
Yeah, I got RNGed so hard there.

4994
05:06:00,620 --> 05:06:03,180
I got RNGed really badly with that.

4995
05:06:04,340 --> 05:06:04,660
Whoops.

4996
05:06:05,440 --> 05:06:06,380
Aw, man.

4997
05:06:08,500 --> 05:06:13,160
Accident lost a lot of heals for the HP for that.

4998
05:06:16,990 --> 05:06:17,350
Yeah.

4999
05:06:19,210 --> 05:06:19,370
Oh.

5000
05:06:21,830 --> 05:06:23,070
I know his patterns, though.

5001
05:06:24,610 --> 05:06:25,530
Okay, I set that in.

5002
05:06:25,670 --> 05:06:26,130
I jinxed myself.

5003
05:06:26,470 --> 05:06:27,430
Oh, this is not the run.

5004
05:06:27,570 --> 05:06:28,310
This is not the run.

5005
05:06:28,430 --> 05:06:29,170
I jinxed myself.

5006
05:06:29,290 --> 05:06:30,370
I jinxed myself with that.

5007
05:06:30,530 --> 05:06:31,490
All right, let's just restart.

5008
05:06:32,290 --> 05:06:33,890
I'm going to restart this run.

5009
05:06:35,470 --> 05:06:37,170
I was like, I know his pattern, though.

5010
05:06:37,350 --> 05:06:38,710
Gets hit by all his attacks.

5011
05:06:38,910 --> 05:06:39,290
Never mind.

5012
05:06:41,730 --> 05:06:42,290
All right.

5013
05:06:53,490 --> 05:06:53,850
Yeah.

5014
05:06:56,150 --> 05:06:56,950

Yeah, one HP.

5023
05:09:25,930 --> 05:09:26,490
At least one HP.

5024
05:09:27,010 --> 05:09:27,010
Nice.

5025
05:09:27,730 --> 05:09:28,630
Oh, my God.

5026
05:09:28,790 --> 05:09:29,210
Are you serious?

5027
05:09:29,990 --> 05:09:30,890
Are you serious?

5028
05:09:31,350 --> 05:09:31,350
Ah!

5029
05:09:32,250 --> 05:09:35,810
You have the dream orange-blue remits constantly fly at you.

5030
05:09:37,570 --> 05:09:41,970
I figured out his fight mechanic, like his mechanics, though.

5031
05:09:44,470 --> 05:09:48,770
Yeah, I'm gonna try- I'm trying not to jump at the ghost, but- Oh my gosh, whoops.

5032
05:09:49,430 --> 05:09:50,630
I was impatient for that.

5033
05:09:51,410 --> 05:09:54,710
I'm trying not to jump at the ghost, but it's just...

5034
05:09:55,530 --> 05:09:57,610
It's just calling for me, you know?

5035
05:10:02,000 --> 05:10:03,300
He's rage-baiting me.

5036
05:10:03,540 --> 05:10:03,960
He knows.

5037
05:10:05,780 --> 05:10:07,660
Are you- he just jumped straight up in the air?

5038
05:10:08,440 --> 05:10:09,700
Oh my god, he definitely knows.

5039
05:10:09,880 --> 05:10:11,220
He is rage-baiting me.

5040
05:10:15,900 --> 05:10:20,320
The fact that he, like, jumped in, like, I don't know if you saw what I saw.

5041
05:10:20,460 --> 05:10:22,020
He literally just jumped in the center.

5042
05:10:23,880 --> 05:10:25,460
Like that, like, oh my god.

5043
05:10:26,720 --> 05:10:27,620
me up.

5044
05:10:27,960 --> 05:10:29,000
Are you serious?

5045
05:10:29,160 --> 05:10:29,680
There's two!

5046
05:10:34,460 --> 05:10:36,900
I think the other thing that tilts me is like

5047
05:10:40,400 --> 05:10:44,380
when like they spawn, literally whenever I got the stagger, they spawn.

5048
05:10:45,020 --> 05:10:46,360
And that like took me a lot.

5049
05:10:49,940 --> 05:10:51,480
Oh, I didn't get a chance to heal.

5050
05:10:52,220 --> 05:10:53,140
I didn't get a chance.

5051
05:10:54,860 --> 05:10:55,200
Oh.

5052
05:10:57,760 --> 05:10:58,820
I got this.

5053
05:11:02,320 --> 05:11:04,620
He jumped straight down, that psyched me up.

5054
05:11:08,180 --> 05:11:10,340
Sorry, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

5055
05:11:10,420 --> 05:11:13,960
It's hard to resist the orange font, the ghost.

5056
05:11:14,160 --> 05:11:15,720
Thank you, the super chat, thank you, thank you.

5057
05:11:16,080 --> 05:11:17,440
I will fucking beat this boss.

5058
05:11:17,640 --> 05:11:18,120
I'm determined.

5059
05:11:18,300 --> 05:11:18,960
I'm so determined.

5060
05:11:19,880 --> 05:11:22,460
I think, like, I've got him, like, no, several times already.

5061
05:11:24,880 --> 05:11:25,560
I remember, like...

5062
05:11:28,620 --> 05:11:29,600
Oh, my God.

5063
05:11:29,720 --> 05:11:31,940
Why would you jump so fucking far?

5064
05:11:35,860 --> 05:11:38,900
oh my god okay this is not the run this is definitely not the run

5065
05:11:42,060 --> 05:11:54,320
oh my god i don't have like anything this is definitely not the run though yeah this is not the run i won't boom

5066
05:12:04,100 --> 05:12:05,740
yeah i will kill you

5067
05:12:13,310 --> 05:12:18,330
Thing is, I want to save for a heal, but I don't know when I need the heal.

5068
05:12:18,810 --> 05:12:19,810
That's the thing.

5069
05:12:25,750 --> 05:12:26,750
His dash fucked me up.

5070
05:12:26,870 --> 05:12:28,140
His dash fucked me up.

5071
05:12:34,720 --> 05:12:35,860
Can I run?

5072
05:12:36,120 --> 05:12:36,540
Yes, I can.

5073
05:12:36,980 --> 05:12:37,780
Oh my god, I got one.

5074
05:12:38,240 --> 05:12:38,900
I got one healed.

5075
05:12:39,180 --> 05:12:40,140
Oh my god!

5076
05:12:44,400 --> 05:12:46,080

5077
05:12:55,130 --> 05:13:15,710

5078
05:13:20,320 --> 05:13:20,820
Yeah.

5079
05:13:22,520 --> 05:13:23,320
I don't know.

5080
05:13:24,380 --> 05:13:24,880
Yeah.

5081
05:13:25,560 --> 05:13:25,880
All right.

5082
05:13:25,980 --> 05:13:27,240
I'm going in with one less HP.

5083
05:13:37,380 --> 05:13:38,120
Okay, I'm locking in.

5084
05:13:38,240 --> 05:13:39,000
I'm not going to talk much.

5085
05:13:39,380 --> 05:13:41,320
I have to lock in, for real.

5086
05:13:43,380 --> 05:13:44,240
Are you serious?

5087
05:13:46,280 --> 05:13:46,740
No!

5088
05:13:48,540 --> 05:13:50,080
I thought it was a dash.

5089
05:13:58,170 --> 05:13:59,850
No, of course I...

5090
05:13:59,850 --> 05:14:00,670
Of course.

5091
05:14:03,190 --> 05:14:04,950
Ah, the orb.

5092
05:14:08,110 --> 05:14:09,090
The orb.

5093
05:14:10,150 --> 05:14:11,270
He's the hardest boss.

5094
05:14:11,790 --> 05:14:15,130
If I beat him, all the other bosses are going to be super easy.

5095
05:14:16,490 --> 05:14:18,210
Okay, this time we're lucky.

5096
05:14:18,470 --> 05:14:19,590
I'm not going to talk much.

5097
05:14:29,300 --> 05:14:30,940
I have to focus for this.

5098
05:14:32,780 --> 05:14:37,000
It's actually, like, like the boss you have.

5099
05:14:37,020 --> 05:14:37,890
I have to focus on.

5100
05:15:07,870 --> 05:15:12,370
Oh, my God.

5101
05:15:13,110 --> 05:15:13,870
Oh, my God.

5102
05:15:14,090 --> 05:15:15,360
I got fucked over by timing.

5103
05:15:23,320 --> 05:15:25,380
He spawned in front of me!

5104
05:15:28,940 --> 05:15:29,600
Oh.

5105
05:15:31,100 --> 05:15:31,760
That...

5106
05:15:31,760 --> 05:15:33,320
Oh, my God.

5107
05:15:34,120 --> 05:15:35,980
The ghost spawned in front of me.

5108
05:15:36,920 --> 05:15:39,940
The ghost spawned in front of me when I was dodging.

5109
05:15:41,120 --> 05:15:41,760
Like...

5110
05:15:42,940 --> 05:15:46,200
That's actually so bullshit!

5111
05:15:48,840 --> 05:15:52,940
If he didn't spot in front of me, I could have been...

5112
05:15:52,940 --> 05:15:54,060
I got the timing.

5113
05:15:55,340 --> 05:15:55,680
Yeah.

5114
05:15:57,000 --> 05:16:00,720
I got... I literally got the timing if he didn't spot in front of me.

5115
05:16:09,940 --> 05:16:11,020
Oh, that's unlucky.

5116
05:16:12,140 --> 05:16:12,300
Mmm!

5117
05:16:13,780 --> 05:16:14,420
Mmm!

5118
05:16:22,060 --> 05:16:22,700
Okay.

5119
05:16:25,060 --> 05:16:26,260
That's a...

5120
05:16:30,860 --> 05:16:32,700
Oh my god, a stupid ghost.

5121
05:16:34,800 --> 05:16:36,720
Are you serious?!

5122
05:16:36,720 --> 05:16:40,780
Oh my

5123
05:17:00,100 --> 05:17:01,320
god, that's bullshit.

5124
05:17:11,670 --> 05:17:12,130
Oh!

5125
05:17:13,550 --> 05:17:14,910
Oh my god!

5126
05:17:18,750 --> 05:17:20,110
I'm getting it though.

5127
05:17:20,930 --> 05:17:23,470
I'm getting- I could have healed, but I got greedy.

5128
05:17:24,390 --> 05:17:27,190
Like, it's because all the ghosts kept spawning around me.

5129
05:17:27,790 --> 05:17:29,550
So, like, I got too scared to heal.

5130
05:17:31,530 --> 05:17:32,930
I got way too scared to heal.

5131
05:17:33,610 --> 05:17:35,410
There's just so many ghosts around me.

5132
05:17:37,910 --> 05:17:39,650
There were so many ghosts around me.

5133
05:17:39,810 --> 05:17:41,450
So, like, I just didn't know when to heal.

5134
05:17:42,430 --> 05:17:43,710
When would be the right time.

5135
05:17:45,890 --> 05:17:47,670
Sometimes when he does that, like, talks with me.

5136
05:18:02,480 --> 05:18:03,120
Oh, my God.

5137
05:18:03,160 --> 05:18:04,680
He should not have got that range.

5138
05:18:06,880 --> 05:18:07,860
so bullshit sometimes.

5139
05:18:25,500 --> 05:18:26,620
Oh my god.

5140
05:18:31,470 --> 05:18:31,790
Okay.

5141
05:18:44,000 --> 05:18:44,900
Are you serious?

5142
05:18:45,980 --> 05:18:46,780
That hits me.

5143
05:18:49,540 --> 05:18:50,800
Oh my god.

5144
05:18:53,780 --> 05:18:54,960
That hits me.

5145
05:18:55,140 --> 05:18:55,320
Okay.

5146
05:18:57,360 --> 05:18:58,080
Got the parry, though.

5147
05:18:58,740 --> 05:18:59,160
At least.

5148
05:19:03,140 --> 05:19:03,720
Oh!

5149
05:19:08,600 --> 05:19:11,660
Oh my god, you stupid ghost!

5150
05:19:15,970 --> 05:19:18,410
Oh my god, the stupid...

5151
05:19:22,370 --> 05:19:26,710
All the ghosts kept respawning in front of me!

5152
05:19:28,550 --> 05:19:29,210
Oh!

5153
05:19:32,380 --> 05:19:33,680
I'm gonna wake up from my dream.

5154
05:19:33,780 --> 05:19:34,360
Fuck this.

5155
05:19:37,340 --> 05:19:41,300
I had like five ghosts spawned in front of me!

5156
05:19:42,500 --> 05:19:44,520
That was actually bullshit.

5157
05:19:47,320 --> 05:19:49,400
That's so fucking bullshit.

5158
05:19:50,160 --> 05:19:51,140
I'm so mad.

5159
05:19:52,120 --> 05:19:52,780
Um, I'm resetting.

5160
05:19:52,900 --> 05:19:53,540
I'm resetting the run.

5161
05:19:53,620 --> 05:19:54,220
I'm so mad.

5162
05:19:54,360 --> 05:19:55,160
I'm just so mad.

5163
05:19:56,380 --> 05:20:00,100
I literally had, like, a three-go spot in front of me.

5164
05:20:00,440 --> 05:20:01,500
Or three to five.

5165
05:20:04,560 --> 05:20:06,720
Do I actually use stun defender charm?

5166
05:20:06,880 --> 05:20:08,320
Okay, what's the closest bench?

5167
05:20:08,440 --> 05:20:09,340
Oh, it's so far.

5168
05:20:09,580 --> 05:20:10,160
I can't.

5169
05:20:10,920 --> 05:20:11,620
It's too far.

5170
05:20:11,800 --> 05:20:12,360
I'm committed.

5171
05:20:13,520 --> 05:20:14,840
Nero, thank you for the super chat.

5172
05:20:14,900 --> 05:20:15,740
Thank you.

5173
05:20:17,700 --> 05:20:19,260
It's way too far.

5174
05:20:20,960 --> 05:20:23,420
I'm going to commit with the one with the charm I have.

5175
05:20:33,120 --> 05:20:36,180
I think I can do it with what I have.

5176
05:20:36,440 --> 05:20:41,180
I just got like so unlucky RNG the entire time.

5177
05:20:41,740 --> 05:20:45,200
Like literally it was just so unlucky.

5178
05:20:47,480 --> 05:20:48,920
With like the spawn.

5179
05:20:50,260 --> 05:20:51,460
Oh my god really?

5180
05:20:53,160 --> 05:20:56,040
like oh my god like how why

5181
05:21:03,840 --> 05:21:26,540
like fuck off really okay i'm getting rage baited i'm actually getting rage baited right now i need to like focus up like i'm playing very sloppy i'm playing very sloppy now that five when five ghosts spawn in front of me it was so tilting it tilted me so hard

5182
05:21:30,420 --> 05:21:31,460
Okay, okay.

5183
05:21:32,640 --> 05:21:34,000
I'm gonna focus up again.

5184
05:21:35,740 --> 05:21:37,620
Because that was such a good run.

5185
05:21:38,260 --> 05:21:41,500
It was such a good run, and then I kept getting ghost spawning.

5186
05:21:48,270 --> 05:21:49,890
I need to be more patient right now.

5187
05:21:50,250 --> 05:21:51,290
I'm not being patient anymore.

5188
05:22:15,860 --> 05:22:16,140
Okay.

5189
05:22:24,000 --> 05:22:24,940
Oh, what?

5190
05:22:25,060 --> 05:22:26,780
What the fuck was that range?

5191
05:22:33,430 --> 05:22:33,950
Okay.

5192
05:22:35,730 --> 05:22:36,950
Oh, God.

5193
05:22:37,890 --> 05:22:39,410
There's too many things to keep track of.

5194
05:22:40,130 --> 05:22:42,050
So, I've fucked me over.

5195
05:22:44,430 --> 05:22:45,170
Are you serious?

5196
05:22:45,550 --> 05:22:45,790
What?

5197
05:22:46,410 --> 05:22:47,410
I got the stagger!

5198
05:22:50,890 --> 05:22:51,670
I didn't need stagger.

5199
05:22:56,610 --> 05:22:57,170
Oh.

5200
05:23:01,490 --> 05:23:02,050
Oh.

5201
05:23:03,450 --> 05:23:05,210
I accidentally doubled him.

5202
05:23:05,310 --> 05:23:05,670
How?

5203
05:23:06,170 --> 05:23:07,030
I got the stagger.

5204
05:23:07,230 --> 05:23:07,970
I was trying to...

5205
05:23:07,970 --> 05:23:10,010
Oh, my spell double hit him.

5206
05:23:11,830 --> 05:23:12,890
That's so unlucky.

5207
05:23:15,930 --> 05:23:17,130
I was so confused.

5208
05:23:17,290 --> 05:23:18,630
I was like, oh, whoa.

5209
05:23:19,510 --> 05:23:19,910
Save.

5210
05:23:24,880 --> 05:23:25,100
Whoops.

5211
05:23:25,520 --> 05:23:26,320
That was actually an accident.

5212
05:23:33,730 --> 05:23:34,530
Are you serious?

5213
05:23:34,830 --> 05:23:35,110
Okay.

5214
05:23:36,050 --> 05:23:37,490
I might have to restart this run.

5215
05:23:37,890 --> 05:23:39,130
Yeah, I'm restarting this run.

5216
05:23:39,310 --> 05:23:40,450
Actually, no, I'll play out.

5217
05:23:40,930 --> 05:23:41,830
Okay, I'll play out.

5218
05:23:44,190 --> 05:23:45,390
Just play out.

5219
05:23:49,480 --> 05:23:49,980
Okay.

5220
05:23:52,500 --> 05:23:55,100
God, I hate the ghost so much.

5221
05:23:58,260 --> 05:24:01,500
The ghost is just so annoying.

5222
05:24:07,710 --> 05:24:09,690
Oh, I had to play.

5223
05:24:11,970 --> 05:24:14,490
I'm not very consistent with this.

5224
05:24:14,630 --> 05:24:19,570
I'm not very consistent with the ground pound, so I don't like doing it.

5225
05:24:22,670 --> 05:24:24,230
I don't like doing that move.

5226
05:24:25,310 --> 05:24:26,850
I'm not very good with it, too.

5227
05:24:31,900 --> 05:24:31,900
Whoops.

5228
05:24:32,260 --> 05:24:32,420
Whoops.

5229
05:24:32,680 --> 05:24:32,860
Goodbye.

5230
05:24:32,980 --> 05:24:33,380
I wake up.

5231
05:24:36,060 --> 05:24:36,860
I wake up.

5232
05:24:37,240 --> 05:24:37,240
Goodbye.

5233
05:24:40,440 --> 05:24:43,220
I'm not consistent with the magic pound.

5234
05:24:51,590 --> 05:24:52,250
There you go.

5235
05:24:53,370 --> 05:24:54,850
It gets so hard for me to do it.

5236
05:24:56,530 --> 05:24:57,610
That's why I don't do it.

5237
05:24:57,890 --> 05:24:58,790
I already do the fire buff.

5238
05:25:06,360 --> 05:25:07,660
Are you serious?

5239
05:25:11,510 --> 05:25:12,110
It's...

5240
05:25:12,110 --> 05:25:13,490
Yeah, that's good.

5241
05:25:13,650 --> 05:25:16,830
I had a really good ghost spawn there.

5242
05:25:18,030 --> 05:25:19,410
That's really good for me.

5243
05:25:19,930 --> 05:25:21,410
How did he jump so far?

5244
05:25:27,130 --> 05:25:28,790
Oh my god.

5245
05:25:32,780 --> 05:25:33,080
Yeah.

5246
05:25:42,160 --> 05:25:43,420
That's the best I could.

5247
05:25:44,140 --> 05:25:46,380
I couldn't heal at once, unfortunately.

5248
05:25:52,880 --> 05:25:53,740
Are you serious?

5249
05:25:53,940 --> 05:25:55,040
You land on me!

5250
05:26:06,000 --> 05:26:06,860
So unlucky!

5251
05:26:11,340 --> 05:26:12,640
That was so unlucky.

5252
05:26:13,680 --> 05:26:14,860
That was so unlucky.

5253
05:26:15,120 --> 05:26:16,220
Of course he spawns in.

5254
05:26:16,580 --> 05:26:18,300
Of course the ghost spawns in.

5255
05:26:18,620 --> 05:26:20,480
The stupid fucking ghost!

5256
05:26:21,160 --> 05:26:22,820
The stupid...

5257
05:26:34,050 --> 05:26:36,000
He always spawns in.

5258
05:26:36,880 --> 05:26:38,020
Like, oh my god.

5259
05:26:38,120 --> 05:26:41,140
He always spawns in when I don't want him to spawn in.

5260
05:26:44,850 --> 05:26:46,330
I will beat him.

5261
05:26:47,630 --> 05:26:49,250
If it's the last thing I do.

5262
05:26:59,950 --> 05:27:00,570
Okay.

5263
05:27:01,050 --> 05:27:03,450
Guys, that was bullshit, right?

5264
05:27:04,190 --> 05:27:05,310
That was...

5265
05:27:06,950 --> 05:27:07,990
That was...

5266
05:27:07,990 --> 05:27:10,110
That was absolutely bullshit.

5267
05:27:10,750 --> 05:27:12,110
What we just saw.

5268
05:27:17,840 --> 05:27:18,740
Oh my god.

5269
05:27:21,560 --> 05:27:22,680
A fucking course.

5270
05:27:22,760 --> 05:27:23,380
A fucking course.

5271
05:27:23,480 --> 05:27:24,220
A fucking curse.

5272
05:27:33,530 --> 05:27:33,790
Okay.

5273
05:27:34,470 --> 05:27:34,750
Alright.

5274
05:27:36,350 --> 05:27:37,970
Okay, I'm gonna...

5275
05:27:37,970 --> 05:27:39,710
I need to take it slow.

5276
05:27:41,230 --> 05:27:41,670
I'm doing...

5277
05:27:41,670 --> 05:27:42,650
I'm being more...

5278
05:27:42,650 --> 05:27:44,190
I'm being too impatient now.

5279
05:27:49,840 --> 05:27:52,080
I'm actually being, like, super impatient.

5280
05:27:56,900 --> 05:27:58,420
Are you serious?

5281
05:27:59,040 --> 05:28:00,260
Sometimes, like...

5282
05:28:00,260 --> 05:28:02,460
He does the dash, like...

5283
05:28:07,220 --> 05:28:10,100
Like, when I'm not expecting it...

5284
05:28:17,080 --> 05:28:19,080
I'm so scared of these guys.

5285
05:28:21,400 --> 05:28:23,180
I'm actually so scared of them.

5286
05:28:31,770 --> 05:28:33,630
I dashed into it accidentally.

5287
05:28:36,010 --> 05:28:36,910
Fucking me.

5288
05:28:37,990 --> 05:28:38,590
Good.

5289
05:28:39,630 --> 05:28:40,690
Oh my god!

5290
05:28:41,030 --> 05:28:41,790
I couldn't do anything.

5291
05:28:43,690 --> 05:28:45,330
I actually couldn't do anything about it.

5292
05:29:03,800 --> 05:29:05,620
Oh, I don't have it.

5293
05:29:06,100 --> 05:29:07,000
I have to just hit it.

5294
05:29:08,020 --> 05:29:08,360
Are you?

5295
05:29:08,960 --> 05:29:12,000
I need a feet.

5296
05:29:12,240 --> 05:29:13,100
I need an angry feet.

5297
05:29:13,640 --> 05:29:14,120
I'll be right back.

5298
05:29:14,360 --> 05:29:15,160
I need an angry feet.

5299
05:30:33,560 --> 05:30:34,820
No, I got this.

5300
05:30:37,200 --> 05:30:38,200
Got this.

5301
05:30:38,280 --> 05:30:39,700
I will kill him.

5302
05:30:40,820 --> 05:30:41,560
I will kill.

5303
05:30:41,660 --> 05:30:42,940
I got so close.

5304
05:30:44,260 --> 05:30:45,920
I will kill him.

5305
05:30:48,880 --> 05:30:49,780
I'm locking in.

5306
05:30:49,960 --> 05:30:51,500
I'm actually, like, super locked in.

5307
05:30:52,760 --> 05:30:53,320
I win these.

5308
05:30:53,480 --> 05:30:54,160
Alan, smug.

5309
05:30:54,480 --> 05:30:55,320
Alan, take it to the super chat.

5310
05:30:55,360 --> 05:30:55,620
Thank you, thank you.

5311
05:31:01,950 --> 05:31:02,830
Oh, what?

5312
05:31:03,950 --> 05:31:05,550
Okay, I don't know how I got hit there.

5313
05:31:07,490 --> 05:31:09,190
Okay, we reset.

5314
05:31:09,690 --> 05:31:10,290
We reset.

5315
05:31:10,570 --> 05:31:11,230
We reset.

5316
05:31:11,730 --> 05:31:12,570
Wait, oh, fuck it.

5317
05:31:12,650 --> 05:31:13,130
I'll tank it.

5318
05:31:13,310 --> 05:31:13,850
We reset.

5319
05:31:14,130 --> 05:31:14,590
We reset.

5320
05:31:15,030 --> 05:31:16,430
We reset.

5321
05:31:16,770 --> 05:31:16,810
Sorry.

5322
05:31:17,230 --> 05:31:18,310
I post-bathroom.

5323
05:31:18,770 --> 05:31:19,990
Post-bathroom run.

5324
05:31:22,090 --> 05:31:22,490
Okay.

5325
05:31:23,210 --> 05:31:24,690
Okay, I will kill him.

5326
05:31:25,730 --> 05:31:26,890
I will kill him.

5327
05:31:27,790 --> 05:31:29,610
How long have I been on this boss now?

5328
05:31:34,140 --> 05:31:34,620
Now!

5329
05:31:34,840 --> 05:31:35,880
Now I lock in.

5330
05:31:36,780 --> 05:31:37,560
How long have I been?

5331
05:31:42,620 --> 05:31:46,360
If I could kill him, every other boss would be so fucking easy.

5332
05:31:48,000 --> 05:31:48,560
40 minutes?

5333
05:31:48,680 --> 05:31:48,920
Okay.

5334
05:31:53,480 --> 05:31:55,940
To be fair, like, I've been first trying every boss.

5335
05:31:56,240 --> 05:31:57,780
So like...

5336
05:32:00,250 --> 05:32:00,730
What?

5337
05:32:02,270 --> 05:32:04,890
Oh my god, I'm getting hit by things I usually never get hit by.

5338
05:32:05,530 --> 05:32:07,430
I'm like, how the fuck did I get hit by that?

5339
05:32:16,480 --> 05:32:18,080
Oh my god, I got double stunned.

5340
05:32:18,340 --> 05:32:19,300
Really, of course I did.

5341
05:32:20,140 --> 05:32:21,980
Of course I did, because fuck me, I guess.

5342
05:32:25,910 --> 05:32:28,170

05:47:18,820 --> 05:47:19,980
Which is the closest one?

5508
05:47:22,080 --> 05:47:24,640
Which one is the closest one I can get to?

5509
05:47:28,490 --> 05:47:29,450
One boss left.

5510
05:47:29,530 --> 05:47:30,350
the crossroads?

5511
05:47:30,690 --> 05:47:31,670
Okay, I'll go there.

5512
05:47:31,990 --> 05:47:35,070
Oh, get out of here.

5513
05:47:35,370 --> 05:47:36,150
I don't even remember.

5514
05:47:37,730 --> 05:47:40,230
In the wall in crossroads.

5515
05:47:40,470 --> 05:47:41,330
First boss.

5516
05:47:42,090 --> 05:47:43,970
Oh, the dream boss of the...

5517
05:47:43,970 --> 05:47:46,230
Do I have to kill the false knights, though?

5518
05:47:49,950 --> 05:47:51,570
Is it worth killing those?

5519
05:47:51,630 --> 05:47:52,890
Like, what do I get out of that?

5520
05:47:53,670 --> 05:47:55,530
What do I get out of killing the...

5521
05:47:57,590 --> 05:47:58,070
Um...

5522
05:47:59,530 --> 05:48:00,630
versions of them.

5523
05:48:09,590 --> 05:48:10,930
A lot of essence.

5524
05:48:12,710 --> 05:48:13,790
Is it worth it, though?

5525
05:48:15,370 --> 05:48:16,590
What is it worth it?

5526
05:48:18,770 --> 05:48:20,050
Oh yeah, it's infected.

5527
05:48:20,150 --> 05:48:20,770
Wait, you're right.

5528
05:48:21,810 --> 05:48:22,750
No, not the...

5529
05:48:22,750 --> 05:48:23,750
Oh my god, you're right.

5530
05:48:23,890 --> 05:48:25,830
It's infected by the ghoul monsters.

5531
05:48:26,550 --> 05:48:28,130
God fucking damn it.

5532
05:48:28,950 --> 05:48:30,930
I can never escape them.

5533
05:48:34,090 --> 05:48:37,090
Okay, but like, how important is the real ending.

5534
05:48:40,590 --> 05:48:43,530
How important is the real ending for this game?

5535
05:48:47,610 --> 05:48:49,190
Oh my god, these guys are annoying.

5536
05:48:49,430 --> 05:48:50,170
It's not.

5537
05:48:53,190 --> 05:48:53,670
Alright.

5538
05:48:54,210 --> 05:48:55,710
That's why I liked it here.

5539
05:49:03,100 --> 05:49:04,780
Alright, what's the next cannon?

5540
05:49:05,120 --> 05:49:07,220

5541
05:49:07,220 --> 05:49:08,440

5542
05:49:09,520 --> 05:49:10,880
What's the word called?

5543
05:49:11,380 --> 05:49:12,480
Main story boss.

5544
05:49:12,860 --> 05:49:13,860
That's closest to me.

5545
05:49:21,060 --> 05:49:21,840
What's the...

5546
05:49:21,840 --> 05:49:24,200

5547
05:49:24,260 --> 05:49:26,680

05:59:04,400 --> 05:59:05,420
Alright, kill the rich.

5688
05:59:05,760 --> 05:59:06,160
Eat the rich.

5689
05:59:06,340 --> 05:59:06,920
Sorry, eat the rich.

5690
05:59:09,620 --> 05:59:14,220
Because if I say kill the rich, then I might legally be in trouble.

5691
05:59:18,020 --> 05:59:20,800
But if I say eat the rich, they'll be like, oh, she's joking, right?

5692
05:59:20,880 --> 05:59:22,120
And I'm like, yeah, sure.

5693
05:59:24,280 --> 05:59:24,680
Yes.

5694
05:59:34,120 --> 05:59:34,600
Alright.

5695
05:59:38,550 --> 05:59:39,610
Oh, I already have.

5696
05:59:41,830 --> 05:59:43,590
I assume I have to go up.

5697
05:59:43,730 --> 05:59:45,830
I'm gonna check over here if there's anything.

5698
05:59:46,130 --> 05:59:46,910
Oh, no, I don't.

5699
05:59:47,510 --> 05:59:49,050
Okay, I just fell down.

5700
05:59:52,390 --> 05:59:52,770
Wait.

5701
05:59:53,330 --> 05:59:54,610
I could have just went this way.

5702
05:59:54,910 --> 05:59:55,610
It'd be faster.

5703
05:59:59,410 --> 05:59:59,850
Okay.

5704
06:00:00,310 --> 06:00:01,450
I'll go left or right.

5705
06:00:02,430 --> 06:00:03,390
I'll go right first.

5706
06:00:04,870 --> 06:00:06,210
I should actually go left first.

5707
06:00:08,890 --> 06:00:09,890
Okay, I guess I'll go right.

5708
06:00:10,310 --> 06:00:12,210
For us for what we must do.

5709
06:00:12,650 --> 06:00:14,150
Many thank you for the super chat.

5710
06:00:14,250 --> 06:00:15,710
Thank you, thank you.

5711
06:00:20,320 --> 06:00:20,940
Wait, maybe?

5712
06:00:22,100 --> 06:00:22,960
Oh, okay.

5713
06:00:23,480 --> 06:00:25,620
I couldn't tell if there's anything over there.

5714
06:00:29,640 --> 06:00:30,820
Is these guys again?

5715
06:00:30,940 --> 06:00:34,020
Oh my god, it's a goddamn trap again!

5716
06:00:35,020 --> 06:00:36,440
Because of course it is.

5717
06:00:47,640 --> 06:00:49,940
okay oh my god are you serious

5718
06:00:54,250 --> 06:01:11,190

5719
06:01:16,940 --> 06:01:17,540
Up I'll go.

5720
06:01:22,370 --> 06:01:23,250
What's that?

5721
06:01:23,710 --> 06:01:24,890
Oh, is this a boss fight?

5722
06:01:29,170 --> 06:01:29,610
Alright.

5723
06:01:30,630 --> 06:01:31,790
I'm not fully healed.

5724
06:01:32,050 --> 06:01:33,990
And I don't know where the bench was.

5725
06:01:35,030 --> 06:01:35,430
Okay.

5726
06:01:36,470 --> 06:01:37,070
Okay.

5727
06:01:37,610 --> 06:01:38,030
Alright.

5728
06:01:39,210 --> 06:01:40,850
What does this boss look like?

5729
06:01:41,890 --> 06:01:42,930
The watch, isn't it?

5730
06:01:43,910 --> 06:01:45,470
Okay, I don't like that.

5731
06:01:45,930 --> 06:01:46,470
Okay.

5732
06:01:49,550 --> 06:01:51,110
All right, at least I can heal.

5733
06:01:51,690 --> 06:01:51,790
Yeah.

5734
06:01:52,370 --> 06:01:52,650
All right.

5735
06:01:54,190 --> 06:01:54,710
Okay.

5736
06:02:00,410 --> 06:02:02,090
Oh, there's more than one.

5737
06:02:02,310 --> 06:02:02,670
Okay.

5738
06:02:03,070 --> 06:02:03,350
All right.

5739
06:02:03,830 --> 06:02:05,790
Now, now I definitely don't like that.

5740
06:02:06,150 --> 06:02:06,730
Oh, okay.

5741
06:02:06,870 --> 06:02:08,110
I definitely don't like that.

5742
06:02:13,220 --> 06:02:13,740
Okay.

5743
06:02:15,360 --> 06:02:15,880
Help.

5744
06:02:20,300 --> 06:02:20,820
Okay.

5745
06:02:22,740 --> 06:02:23,220
One.

5746
06:02:23,560 --> 06:02:28,760
down question mark up and then another spawns in

5747
06:02:32,460 --> 06:02:33,920
no heals for me

5748
06:02:38,020 --> 06:03:03,540
okay what a fun group activity all right that is also my weakness guys that is one of my weaknesses when the enemy is more than one person because i think okay i'm gonna say it But I find, like, boss fights where they just have multiple enemies to be cheap boss fight designs.

5749
06:03:03,820 --> 06:03:04,300
I'm sorry.

5750
06:03:04,900 --> 06:03:12,500
I think these types of boss fights where it's more than one boss is very cheap design.

5751
06:03:16,840 --> 06:03:18,940
I hate these types of boss fights.

5752
06:03:19,140 --> 06:03:20,500
I hate those designs.

5753
06:03:23,560 --> 06:03:25,340
I hate it so much.

5754
06:03:29,870 --> 06:03:32,110
You look like a cheap boss to sign.

5755
06:03:32,650 --> 06:03:35,330
What do you mean I'm Jane Silkson?

5756
06:03:40,600 --> 06:03:42,500
I'm just Jane Silkson.

5757
06:03:42,720 --> 06:03:43,740
You're just jealous.

5758
06:03:49,170 --> 06:03:51,230
Trying to kill it before he fucking...

5759
06:03:51,230 --> 06:03:51,930
Okay, there we go.

5760
06:03:52,510 --> 06:03:53,050
That's good.

5761
06:03:57,250 --> 06:03:57,970
Oh my god.

5762
06:03:58,090 --> 06:03:59,010
Now there's two?

5763
06:03:59,510 --> 06:04:00,950
How did they get beat because...

5764
06:04:07,180 --> 06:04:08,660
This is actually not fair.

5765
06:04:08,760 --> 06:04:11,600
This is actually not fair.

5766
06:04:18,540 --> 06:04:19,700
Oh my god.

5767
06:04:20,180 --> 06:04:23,460
I don't even know how you should be able to dodge that.

5768
06:04:23,660 --> 06:04:24,340
I...

5769
06:04:26,940 --> 06:04:29,000
Oh my god.

5770
06:04:38,950 --> 06:04:41,470
Oh my god.

5771
06:04:41,950 --> 06:04:42,310
Alright.

5772
06:04:44,370 --> 06:04:44,930
Pull.

5773
06:04:46,210 --> 06:04:48,670
Yeah, that was not a very...

5774
06:04:48,690 --> 06:04:53,470
Oh my god, okay, I'm just gonna, okay, I'm, okay, whatever.

5775
06:04:53,670 --> 06:04:55,190
Let me sit on my bench again.

5776
06:04:55,570 --> 06:04:58,690
Let me just sit on my bench.

5777
06:04:59,230 --> 06:05:05,190
All right, it's this way.

5778
06:05:06,750 --> 06:05:07,430
Are you serious?

5779
06:05:07,510 --> 06:05:09,410
Like, you chased me all the way here?

5780
06:05:12,310 --> 06:05:12,830
Nerd.

5781
06:05:14,670 --> 06:05:16,110
Look what he likes you.

5782
06:05:16,550 --> 06:05:17,470
You can try hard.

5783
06:05:19,350 --> 06:05:20,330
There you go.

5784
06:05:20,730 --> 06:05:21,630
Yeah, you like that?

5785
06:05:22,250 --> 06:05:23,030
Look what you did.

5786
06:05:23,290 --> 06:05:24,390
Look what you made me do.

5787
06:05:25,910 --> 06:05:27,470
I wasn't even trying to kill you.

5788
06:05:33,940 --> 06:05:36,180
God, I wish I had my Among Us sprite.

5789
06:05:39,620 --> 06:05:42,820
Maybe if it was Among Us, I'd choose more.

5790
06:05:43,980 --> 06:05:45,020
I'd focus more.

5791
06:05:58,720 --> 06:05:59,120
Okay.

5792
06:06:04,040 --> 06:06:06,140
Alright, we got one out.

5793
06:06:07,640 --> 06:06:08,820
It's just harder.

5794
06:06:08,960 --> 06:06:15,500
It's a lot harder, more so of the fact that they both spin.

5795
06:06:17,400 --> 06:06:21,200
Like, when they corner me like that, it just sucks.

5796
06:06:23,160 --> 06:06:24,660
Like, I don't know.

5797
06:06:28,060 --> 06:06:30,980
It's just very unlucky when they corner me like that.

5798
06:06:33,460 --> 06:06:34,140
Okay.

5799
06:06:37,120 --> 06:07:10,520
especially when they do that jump thing jesus christ that jump thing it's so fucking dumb oh my god like oh my that's not oh my god it's not fair holy i wish i could okay like i need that magic here okay i don't need the compass if i get through this i have two slots if I have anything,

5800
06:07:10,660 --> 06:07:11,200
that's good.

5801
06:07:12,140 --> 06:07:15,080
I'll just put the, maybe more of the spells.

5802
06:07:21,420 --> 06:07:22,420
Oh, okay.

5803
06:07:22,580 --> 06:07:24,200
I could do dash, too.

5804
06:07:24,680 --> 06:07:26,480
I don't think I need the dash.

5805
06:07:30,490 --> 06:07:30,890
Okay.

5806
06:07:32,950 --> 06:07:34,730
I'll get the, I'll get the soul sting.

5807
06:07:36,650 --> 06:07:38,870
I'm just not good at the dash spell.

5808
06:07:39,030 --> 06:07:46,490
I feel, I mean, I guess like, it'll be good to learn it for the sake that, okay.

5809
06:07:49,010 --> 06:07:50,550
Alright, get out of here.

5810
06:07:54,930 --> 06:07:55,330
Okay.

5811
06:07:55,870 --> 06:07:57,130
I'm just not good with it.

5812
06:07:57,270 --> 06:07:58,850
I only know how to do fireball.

5813
06:07:59,890 --> 06:08:00,330
Fireball!

5814
06:08:02,650 --> 06:08:03,930
And drop a chandelier.

5815
06:08:04,070 --> 06:08:05,130
Wait, how do I drop the chandelier?

5816
06:08:07,770 --> 06:08:09,250
Give me the fucking elevator.

5817
06:08:16,720 --> 06:08:18,680
How do I drop the chandelier, though?

5818
06:08:20,720 --> 06:08:21,100
Wait.

5819
06:08:21,160 --> 06:08:22,200
He hurts me?

5820
06:08:23,780 --> 06:08:25,160
I thought we're friends!

5821
06:08:30,550 --> 06:08:31,230
Break the wall.

5822
06:08:31,570 --> 06:08:32,550
Why do I break the wall?

5823
06:08:33,410 --> 06:08:33,790
Oh well.

5824
06:08:33,990 --> 06:08:35,190
Well, I guess we'll never learn.

5825
06:08:39,790 --> 06:08:41,930
I guess we won't learn how to break the wall.

5826
06:08:42,510 --> 06:08:44,430
I gotta

5827
06:08:48,490 --> 06:08:51,630
focus for this.

5828
06:08:54,270 --> 06:08:56,250
I'm just gonna try my best to focus for it.

5829
06:08:57,150 --> 06:08:58,010
Oh, I didn't see.

5830
06:08:58,030 --> 06:08:59,430
the jump for it.

5831
06:09:06,780 --> 06:09:07,720
Oh, that's scary.

5832
06:09:07,940 --> 06:09:08,100
That's scary.

5833
06:09:08,260 --> 06:09:08,560
That's scary.

5834
06:09:09,640 --> 06:09:10,620
Are you serious?

5835
06:09:29,440 --> 06:09:29,740
Okay.

5836
06:09:30,580 --> 06:09:31,340
Oh, no!

5837
06:09:33,600 --> 06:09:34,540
I'm one life.

5838
06:09:37,600 --> 06:09:38,900
Are you fucking...

5839
06:09:38,900 --> 06:09:39,300
Oh!

5840
06:09:40,080 --> 06:09:42,020
This boss is so hard.

5841
06:09:42,880 --> 06:09:43,320
Oh!

5842
06:09:44,420 --> 06:09:46,220
This boss is actually so hard.

5843
06:09:48,380 --> 06:09:49,460
That is so...

5844
06:09:49,460 --> 06:09:51,320
The shit that you do is so bullshit.

5845
06:09:54,240 --> 06:09:55,040
Yeah.

5846
06:10:01,140 --> 06:10:01,760
Oh.

5847
06:10:03,460 --> 06:10:05,960
Left the room up top?

5848
06:10:07,760 --> 06:10:08,420
How so?

5849
06:10:21,200 --> 06:10:23,200
Before I enter the arena.

5850
06:10:25,160 --> 06:10:25,900
Oh, this?

5851
06:10:28,720 --> 06:10:29,920
What the fuck?

5852
06:10:30,220 --> 06:10:30,560
Oh.

5853
06:10:34,770 --> 06:10:36,270
Did I do it?

5854
06:10:40,700 --> 06:11:10,700

5855
06:11:24,260 --> 06:11:24,600
Okay.

5856
06:11:35,780 --> 06:11:36,900
Oh my god.

5857
06:11:39,640 --> 06:11:40,960
Oh, this is bad that they're all out.

5858
06:11:44,910 --> 06:11:45,130
Okay.

5859
06:11:49,810 --> 06:11:50,370
Oh.

5860
06:11:51,050 --> 06:11:53,330
I actually have to focus so much for these guys.

5861
06:11:55,850 --> 06:11:57,190
Okay, one, two more.

5862
06:12:03,080 --> 06:12:03,640
Oh!

5863
06:12:03,640 --> 06:12:04,580
It's unlucky.

5864
06:12:04,800 --> 06:12:06,080
For me.

5865
06:12:19,750 --> 06:12:20,970
Oh, are you serious?

5866
06:12:22,410 --> 06:12:23,390
Are you serious?

5867
06:12:23,730 --> 06:12:24,710
Oh, my God.

5868
06:12:26,550 --> 06:12:27,730
Of course, they both decide.

5869
06:12:27,950 --> 06:12:32,330
Oh, they both decide to spin at irregular timing.

5870
06:12:34,390 --> 06:12:38,010
They both spun irregularly.

5871
06:12:39,530 --> 06:12:40,010
Yeah.

5872
06:12:42,710 --> 06:12:43,630
Oh.

5873
06:12:44,390 --> 06:12:46,030
They like it was such hard.

5874
06:12:46,090 --> 06:12:52,410
It was so hard to time that because the they both like spun in such a weird time in there I'm getting closer.

5875
06:12:52,610 --> 06:13:12,390
I'm figuring it out Oh, I'm just that I'm worse when it's like multiple characters Because it's like I have to keep track of like so many different things at the same time But if it's one person if I'm fighting one person, it's a lot easier to discern like the ghost was fucking with me The ghost was the thing that was fucking with me,

5876
06:13:12,390 --> 06:13:15,310
but when I like but They were at least one hit.

5877
06:13:17,430 --> 06:13:24,230
But, like, for this, they're, like, multiple hits, and it's, like, there's, like, so many of them to, like, keep track of.

5878
06:13:25,050 --> 06:13:27,270
So, like, that's what messes with me the most.

5879
06:13:30,630 --> 06:13:33,770
I just get messed up when, like, there's so many people I have to fight.

5880
06:13:35,890 --> 06:13:39,370
Like, right now, see, like, like, like...

5881
06:13:40,570 --> 06:13:43,510
I'm also, like, messing up really badly.

5882
06:13:44,230 --> 06:14:02,830
I shouldn't be messing up this run this guy because he's like one person There you go I can heal too if you just get out of time to heal I'm trying to like like

5883
06:14:09,570 --> 06:14:17,790
what the fuck was that like actually what was that

5884
06:14:25,960 --> 06:14:39,200
yeah okay my timing for these guys are so hard i was i'm messing up the timing for them

5885
06:14:52,310 --> 06:15:18,490
no oh my god i did it i did it oh my god oh my god i did it oh i think This one's not as annoying as cool boy, but I hate multiple enemies.

5886
06:15:18,750 --> 06:15:23,270
I hate them so much I just find I just find it.

5887
06:15:23,270 --> 06:15:33,110
I just find it so annoying and to me it feels so cheap Because it's much more RNG when there's like multiple enemies

5888
06:15:36,260 --> 06:15:38,280
Oh my god, we did it though.

5889
06:15:38,820 --> 06:15:44,480
Holy shit All right, that's a story boss, right?

5890
06:15:49,800 --> 06:15:52,100
Kira, thank you, thank you, thank you.

5891
06:15:54,040 --> 06:15:54,480
Alright.

5892
06:15:55,240 --> 06:15:56,100
Where do I go?

5893
06:15:56,900 --> 06:15:57,600
Like, where am I?

5894
06:15:57,640 --> 06:15:59,360
Oh, there's a lot of dead bugs here.

5895
06:16:03,650 --> 06:16:04,450
Alright, good.

5896
06:16:05,630 --> 06:16:07,850
I'm glad this is a required boss.

5897
06:16:10,530 --> 06:16:11,230
Where am I?

5898
06:16:11,290 --> 06:16:11,910
Oh, wait, what?

5899
06:16:12,050 --> 06:16:12,890
What's over here?

5900
06:16:15,750 --> 06:16:16,710
What's over here?

5901
06:16:18,770 --> 06:16:19,210
Nothing?

5902
06:16:19,790 --> 06:16:20,830
Oh, no.

5903
06:16:22,530 --> 06:16:23,110
It's fine.

5904
06:16:23,890 --> 06:16:24,930
Just do this.

5905
06:16:30,020 --> 06:16:31,800
Maybe there'll be something over there.

5906
06:16:31,880 --> 06:16:32,880
I don't need the elevator.

5907
06:16:33,680 --> 06:16:35,360
I'll do this myself.

5908
06:16:38,860 --> 06:16:39,420
Hello?

5909
06:16:43,760 --> 06:16:45,480
I'll make my own elevator.

5910
06:16:47,420 --> 06:16:48,760
Yeah, I took that bait.

5911
06:16:49,060 --> 06:16:49,780
It baited me.

5912
06:16:49,960 --> 06:16:52,900
There were so many secret rooms, and then suddenly zero secret rooms.

5913
06:16:53,000 --> 06:16:53,320
Hello?

5914
06:16:54,860 --> 06:16:56,720
A sleeping figure lays on top.

5915
06:17:01,560 --> 06:17:02,380
Oh, master.

5916
06:17:02,740 --> 06:17:03,180
So young.

5917
06:17:03,380 --> 06:17:03,800
All right.

5918
06:17:04,780 --> 06:17:05,480
I got a heal.

5919
06:17:07,040 --> 06:17:08,400
Imagine if that guy killed me.

5920
06:17:08,500 --> 06:17:10,220
I did not realize how low my HP was.

5921
06:17:13,520 --> 06:17:14,040
I...

5922
06:17:14,040 --> 06:17:15,220
Oh, my God.

5923
06:17:15,340 --> 06:17:16,040
I'm dreaming.

5924
06:17:16,260 --> 06:17:16,520
Okay.

5925
06:17:19,240 --> 06:17:19,700
Hello.

5926
06:17:20,040 --> 06:17:20,600
What's this?

5927
06:17:23,040 --> 06:17:23,540
Hello.

5928
06:17:32,060 --> 06:17:33,100
Working beloved.

5929
06:17:33,260 --> 06:17:34,800
Am I supposed to kill him?

5930
06:17:42,390 --> 06:17:43,590
Asleep to serve.

5931
06:17:45,550 --> 06:17:47,450
The bonds must remain.

5932
06:17:49,330 --> 06:17:49,790
Remain.

5933
06:17:51,950 --> 06:17:52,590
Remain.

5934
06:17:54,510 --> 06:17:55,150
Remain.

5935
06:17:55,890 --> 06:17:56,430
Is he done?

5936
06:17:56,930 --> 06:17:57,310
All right.

5937
06:17:58,410 --> 06:17:58,590
Remain.

5938
06:17:58,870 --> 06:18:00,170
I think he's done, guys.

5939
06:18:00,430 --> 06:18:02,270
You guys, guys, what do you think he's going to stay next?

5940
06:18:03,690 --> 06:18:04,230
Remain.

5941
06:18:05,590 --> 06:18:06,230
Okay.

5942
06:18:06,750 --> 06:18:08,510
Now it's murder time.

5943
06:18:08,570 --> 06:18:13,050
There we go.

5944
06:18:13,230 --> 06:18:14,130
Remain.

5945
06:18:15,930 --> 06:18:17,390
I'll be the focus.

5946
06:18:18,850 --> 06:18:19,990
I'm focusing.

5947
06:18:22,890 --> 06:18:24,070
First try.

5948
06:18:31,520 --> 06:18:31,680
Huh?

5949
06:18:39,480 --> 06:18:41,620
Easiest boss of my life.

5950
06:18:50,690 --> 06:18:51,890
Hitless run, guys.

5951
06:18:52,070 --> 06:18:52,590
Look at that.

5952
06:18:53,550 --> 06:18:54,270
No hits.

5953
06:18:56,130 --> 06:18:56,670
Okay.

5954
06:18:56,690 --> 06:18:57,810
No hits, too.

5955
06:18:57,930 --> 06:18:58,730
I killed...

5956
06:18:58,730 --> 06:18:59,470
Oh, I'm such a gamer.

5957
06:18:59,970 --> 06:19:01,310
I killed him with zero hits.

5958
06:19:02,230 --> 06:19:03,070
I guess I go down now.

5959
06:19:07,530 --> 06:19:09,290
Alright, we got a fine bench and then we'll call it here.

5960
06:19:09,410 --> 06:19:10,790
Oh my gosh, I've been too savage.

5961
06:19:10,890 --> 06:19:12,150
I did say today was going to be long stream.

5962
06:19:12,870 --> 06:19:13,450
I was going to pay.

5963
06:19:13,950 --> 06:19:15,290
I made so much progress.

5964
06:19:15,550 --> 06:19:18,110
Am I finishing this faster than people expected?

5965
06:19:23,110 --> 06:19:24,570
I feel like I am.

5966
06:19:26,070 --> 06:19:26,670
Okay, where do I go?

5967
06:19:26,690 --> 06:20:17,150
go way faster i told you guys we're gonna finish on that before sex song i told you nobody believe me yeah all right how do i get down i'd be a few oh yeah i'd be a three hour boss how long okay how long did that boss take you guys there was one guy one dragon that was like i'm gonna try and fight this boss at the same time as you and then see if i could beat it before you did you did you oh the goo boy was optional well the goo boy was not optional it was just to show everyone how much of a gamer i am i have to remind everybody that i am in fact yes a gamer

5968
06:20:22,390 --> 06:20:29,940
probably still fighting it Can I just go back to the bench?

5969
06:20:31,120 --> 06:20:32,180
I assume so, right?

5970
06:20:36,340 --> 06:20:37,960
I just did that to flex.

5971
06:20:38,980 --> 06:20:42,860
And my nail was apparently underleveled, too, for it.

5972
06:20:44,760 --> 06:20:45,900
It was to send...

5973
06:20:45,900 --> 06:20:46,260
Exactly.

5974
06:20:46,740 --> 06:20:49,480
The good boy was to send a fucking message.

5975
06:20:50,840 --> 06:20:52,980
Alright, we're gonna call it here, guys.

5976
06:20:53,140 --> 06:20:53,900
That was fun.

5977
06:20:53,980 --> 06:20:57,160
I've been having a really fun time.

5978
06:20:59,200 --> 06:21:28,760
playing Hollow Knight so far and honestly I've been enjoying the ride it makes me you know I've never played in Metrovania before but Hollow Knight has actually been incredibly fun I definitely like the boss fights a lot I think the boss fights are very rewarding I'm always very lost the only thing that I will criticize is that I'm always very lost but that's just me I've always been lost in multiple games.

5979
06:21:30,020 --> 06:21:31,020
This is not a...

5980
06:21:31,020 --> 06:21:32,400
And this is no exception.

5981
06:21:32,980 --> 06:21:34,160
But I think I've been doing pretty well.

5982
06:21:34,520 --> 06:21:36,680
I've been picking up stuff really well.

5983
06:21:37,940 --> 06:21:41,020
And even though I'm really bad platformers, I think I'm doing pretty alright.

5984
06:21:42,220 --> 06:21:43,360
Zonderman, thank you for the super chat.

5985
06:21:43,440 --> 06:21:44,020
Thank you, thank you.

5986
06:21:44,040 --> 06:21:49,000
The game does kind of mechanic where you can upgrade or no bosses get a little bit more HP.

5987
06:21:49,180 --> 06:21:49,640
Oh, I didn't know.

5988
06:21:50,040 --> 06:21:50,940
That's interesting.

5989
06:21:51,300 --> 06:21:51,880
Thank you for the super chat.

5990
06:21:51,960 --> 06:21:52,300
Thank you, thank you.

5991
06:21:52,340 --> 06:21:53,000
Anyway, guys.

5992
06:21:53,380 --> 06:21:56,980
I am blowing the head off now.

5993
06:21:57,260 --> 06:22:02,920
Instead of some work to do after stream, but after that, I'm going to grab food, do a little bit of work, and then sleep.

5994
06:22:03,420 --> 06:22:04,360
And tomorrow is Minecraft!

5995
06:22:04,760 --> 06:22:05,600
It's the Doki SMP.

5996
06:22:05,980 --> 06:22:11,940
If you are a member, I am streaming on the member's Minecraft server, but as a public stream.

5997
06:22:12,360 --> 06:22:14,300
So any member can fully join the server.

5998
06:22:15,040 --> 06:22:17,700
The instructions are in the community post if you are a member, Goon.

5999
06:22:18,180 --> 06:22:22,280
I'll also link it in the waiting room for tomorrow's stream.

6000
06:22:22,640 --> 06:22:24,140
Those who want to get access to it.

6001
06:22:24,340 --> 06:22:24,760
Hey, guys!

6002
06:22:25,020 --> 06:22:28,980
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, Check out him around to get that blood flowing.

6003
06:22:29,140 --> 06:22:32,120
And if you suffer me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

6004
06:22:32,340 --> 06:22:33,580
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6005
06:22:34,080 --> 06:22:34,640
Bye, guys.

6006
06:22:35,260 --> 06:22:35,520
Bye.
