1
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,250
Well, oops, sorry, wrong scene.

2
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,110
Sorry, it's not a movie, guys.

3
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,610
Woo, starting off strong.

4
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,950
Starting off so strong.

5
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,270
Where is it?

6
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,670
I know I'm all over the place right now.

7
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,490
I'm trying to find the scene.

8
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,450
I looked at it before I was working on it.

9
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,630
Okay, it's right here.

10
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,870
Okay, no movie.

11
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,810
No movie.

12
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,050
There we go.

13
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:18,550
Oh, there.

14
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,930
There's Twitter, though.

15
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,510
There's Twitter.

16
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,770
I don't know why it showed Twitter.

17
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,610
It was not supposed to show Twitter.

18
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,850
I was like, what the fuck?

19
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,990
I don't even have Twitter open.

20
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,490
That's so weird.

21
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,970
I don't even have Twitter open.

22
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,470
Oh my god, ghost Twitter.

23
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,970
And that's so weird.

24
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,350
It's like ghost Twitter or some shit.

25
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,570
No, I swear to god, I did not have Twitter open.

26
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,010
Also, there's a golden kappa.

27
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,550
I'm all over the place right now.

28
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,450
Give me a sec.

29
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,010
Okay, there we go.

30
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,010
Now it's just men.

31
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,010
It's okay, we're good now.

32
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,570
Now we just have men on the screen.

33
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,230
Oh my god.

34
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,610
All right, so, okay.

35
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,050
Let me know if everything is going okay.

36
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,610
Suddenly, just dudes being bros.

37
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,610
So, for those who are like, what's going on right now?

38
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,910
I'm talking right now.

39
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,150
My points are more important.

40
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,930
Also, Bite Size, thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

41
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,190
Thank you, thank you.

42
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,530
All right, thank you for the five gifted subs.

43
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,870
Holy shit, thank you for the...

44
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,400
Okay, awkward time for...

45
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,190
This is a sponsored stream.

46
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,590
So, this is presented by...

47
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,770
Presented by Samsung Galaxy Season 25 Ultra.

48
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,890
So, here's a shout out.

49
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,730
Thank you guys for all the gifted subs.

50
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,130
All the support, everybody.

51
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,090
So, give me a sec while I set everything up.

52
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,010
I'm all over the place right now.

53
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,570
As you guys know from earlier today.

54
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,010
If I was like, post fucking...

55
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,890
Post drinking, post blood moon...

56
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,890
Post Thursday at the blood moon.

57
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,710
So, like, I am all over the place at the moment.

58
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,450
So...

59
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,170
I said post drinking, post...

60
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,090
Post drinking, post blood moon.

61
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,490
So, today is the...

62
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:03,450
Today, we will be watching the 100,000K Gear Up Cup Draft.

63
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,150
Powered by or presented by Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

64
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:16,010
So, this is basically a bunch of Call of Duty pro players or players will be playing on the Samsung Galaxy phone.

65
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,110
And competing for $100,000.

66
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,770
And yeah, 100...

67
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,550
Sorry, 100K.

68
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,270
Sorry, competing for $100,000.

69
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,890
And they're all gonna be gaming, playing Call of Duty Mobile.

70
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,250
And today, the first day is...

71
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,350
The first day is basically draft day.

72
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,230
Where I think it's like, they all see the skill level of everybody.

73
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,930
And everybody's skill level.

74
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,410
And then their teams and everything.

75
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,990
And then there's gonna be finals on the 25th.

76
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,410
So, the first day is just the draft cycle.

77
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,710
And then the finals will be like the actual game game.

78
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,150
So, just to see like what skill level everybody is.

79
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,170
And like what stages they're gonna be at.

80
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,870
It's like, it's pretty interesting.

81
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,070
But yes, huge shout out to Samsung.

82
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,170
And for picking me as a co-streamer.

83
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,250
This is a watch-along of the official event of Samsung.

84
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,950
From the Samsung US channel.

85
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,770
And I'm gonna judge hard.

86
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,190
I don't know.

87
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,790
I've never seen Call of Duty Mobile gameplay before.

88
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,130
So, it's gonna be pretty interesting.

89
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,850
The fact that all of this is gonna be played on their phones.

90
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,970
And it's like a live event too.

91
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,950
It's like a LAN event.

92
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,370
So, they're gonna be in Las Vegas, I believe.

93
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,850
And so, it's like 16 Call of Duty experts.

94
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,950
Teaming up with like, I think like four Call of Duty Mobile pros.

95
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,330
So, they're bringing a bunch of like PC gamers.

96
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,150
And then pairing them up with like Call of Duty Mobile.

97
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,670
I didn't realize Call of Duty Mobile has like a pro scene.

98
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,810
So, that's really interesting.

99
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,290
And then I just think it's funny that you bring a bunch of PC players.

100
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,650
And you're like, here's a phone.

101
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,110
Do what you did on PC and do it on the phone.

102
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,610
So, it's gonna be so interesting to see.

103
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,510
I wonder if they've practiced on the...

104
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,530
I feel like they have to practice on the phone.

105
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:27,970
But I feel like it's gonna be very interesting to see if like, you know, what they do on PC will translate into a phone.

106
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,670
So, especially like the different mechanics.

107
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,150
You have to, you know, like the different...

108
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:45,410
The different stuff you can do regarding like the mouse and keyboard.

109
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,990
And playing on the Samsung Galaxy.

110
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,950
I wonder like how well that will translate into each other.

111
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,900
So, I'm like...

112
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,200
My manager was like, don't talk about this.

113
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,240
Okay, I'm gonna be like, please remind me why I can't talk.

114
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm gonna be like, please remind me why I can't talk.

115
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,780
Professional.

116
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,540
I'm making sure everything is good to go on my end.

117
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,460
Let me know if the sound is okay.

118
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,620
I don't know if sound guy is here.

119
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,080
But please let me know how the sound is so far.

120
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,380
Now you're a professional streamer.

121
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,580
Oh my god, I can like...

122
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,540
I don't know if you guys see this.

123
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,000
But I could randomly knock knock.

124
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,320
Knock knock.

125
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,800
Just randomly like, hey, I'm doing a different thing.

126
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,800
Knock knock.

127
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm gonna listen to this.

128
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,500
Oh, they're low?

129
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:56,920
Okay.

130
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,620
Oh, they're in game already?

131
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,660
Oh wait, what's the...

132
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,280
Give me a sec.

133
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,300
I just realized.

134
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,100
It is...

135
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,120
Let me put it at 1080.

136
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,420
Let me put it at 1080 real quick.

137
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,460
I think the draft stage, they're like basically...

138
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,220
They're not...

139
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,580
They're not in Las Vegas yet.

140
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,240
So they're just drafting to see it.

141
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,260
Oh my god.

142
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,880
Oh, is this a 1v1?

143
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,560
Oh my god, look at that movement on the phone.

144
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,220
You saw a player running around on the top there.

145
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,380
Some fantastic movement.

146
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,240
But I like this.

147
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,480
This is where I would be.

148
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,040
Right here.

149
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,480
And wait, I know this map.

150
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,200
This is like...

151
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,320
That's the map from...

152
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,560
That you guys put...

153
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,980
We put like 50 dragoons in.

154
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,800
Remember that?

155
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,860
This is the map that 50 of us were in.

156
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,800
Rust, yeah.

157
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,400
I remember.

158
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,520
I saw...

159
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,160
I saw Nicki Minaj here.

160
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,180
Maybe hoping to catch someone like this player on the outside.

161
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,060
You know, if you've ever played pubs for Rust or if you've ever...

162
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,240
You know, actually 1v1 somebody on this map.

163
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,120
If you get control of the top of that oil rig, it is...

164
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,580
That's crazy.

165
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,880
The amount of movement on...

166
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
This is not...

167
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,580
This actually looks really good for mobile in terms of movement-wise.

168
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,700
How are they doing?

169
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,760
How are they doing this?

170
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,220
Show me the mobile hands!

171
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,380
Give me the phone cam on your Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra!

172
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,260
Bro, I wish I was in it.

173
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,200
I get a free Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

174
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,780
You guys like how I mentioned Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra?

175
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,920
You know what phone you want to buy now?

176
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,100
You know, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra?

177
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,480
Yeah.

178
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,620
Yeah, they're actually really good.

179
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,260
Like, I'm just one...

180
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,100
Like, I can't tell which one is the PC player and which one's the mobile player.

181
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,140
Oh, bring up the volume?

182
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,600
Okay.

183
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,380
Boost up the sound.

184
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,360
I can't tell.

185
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,220
Oh my god, you tell.

186
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
He's on his phone right here.

187
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,780
His eyes are glued right on that screen.

188
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,700
You can't really see it because there's this, but you can tell.

189
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,880
Bro, move your camera!

190
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,180
Move it higher!

191
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,100
Move it higher!

192
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,160
I can't see!

193
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,420
He's so locked in.

194
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,540
He's so...

195
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,400
Oh my god.

196
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,280
I think you have to like...

197
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,560
Especially like, you have to look so close.

198
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,820
Especially because like...

199
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,320
Wait, where...

200
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,040
How did he die?

201
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,220
He died so fucking fast!

202
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
Is the sound better?

203
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,820
Is it better now, the sound?

204
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,600
We're putting on a show here for the viewers at home.

205
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,220
Yeah, but it's 100k!

206
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,420
We don't want no show!

207
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,060
We want gaming!

208
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,920
Fight as if you want the $100,000 on your Samsung Galaxy X25 Ultra.

209
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,120
Guys, does this seem...

210
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Does this seem natural?

211
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,140
Yeah!

212
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,560
Show us what that phone can do!

213
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,980
Might as end the game in five...

214
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,520
I want the mobile players to like...

215
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,480
Just show the PC players like...

216
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,860
Just how much better they are.

217
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,680
So natural.

218
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,300
As natural as the gym boss is here.

219
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,320
I'm thinking of buying a phone.

220
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,620
Which phone would you recommend?

221
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,980
Oh my god!

222
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,220
It's a good thing you mentioned that.

223
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,600
Thank you, NotPaidViewer105 to talk in my chat.

224
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,380
Well, I believe looking at this gameplay...

225
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:41,420
And seeing like how these professional Call of Duty players are playing on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

226
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,500
I believe that...

227
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,480
To up your gaming skills and look at those graphics.

228
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,420
That the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra would be the phone that you should get.

229
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,440
Yes, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

230
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,100
Yes, yes, that's right.

231
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,920
I feel like if all...

232
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,660
And don't you guys want to match with me, Dragoons?

233
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,640
We could have samesies.

234
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,100
I wonder what happens.

235
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,600
Same clan, exactly.

236
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,160
Oh.

237
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,400
It felt as much of a rust 1v1 as it really could be.

238
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,940
Minus the snipers.

239
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,300
Oh, does it sound better?

240
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,680
Be right back.

241
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,400
Thanks, guys.

242
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,600
I really appreciate your support, everybody.

243
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,920
Thank you, Endoki for letting me know about the Samsung S25 Galaxy Ultra.

244
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,480
I'm glad you guys know about it, guys.

245
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,340
It seems like a very impressive...

246
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,780
Oh, do you know?

247
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,420
Oh, I do.

248
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:58,980
Let me...

249
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,520
Give me a sec.

250
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,000
Let me...

251
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,980
I actually do, guys.

252
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,880
Let me find it real quick.

253
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:05,820
All right.

254
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:13,120
Obviously, I know on the top of my head because I have the phone in my hand right now, guys.

255
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,540
The Galaxy...

256
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,760
It has unmatched power.

257
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,620
The Ga...

258
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,220
Oh, wait, guys.

259
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,400
Also, very beautiful segue so I can talk about this.

260
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,340
Not paid viewer 1543.

261
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Unmatched power.

262
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,880
The Galaxy S25 Ultra is an absolute beast.

263
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,400
It's rocking the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.

264
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,840
The most advanced processor ever on Galaxy phone.

265
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,720
That means a crazy fast performance and super smooth gameplay.

266
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
Even with the most demanding games.

267
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,320
And there's also graph...

268
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,020
Oh, my God.

269
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,220
Huskers in here?

270
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,200
Huskers?

271
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:55,880
Aiden?

272
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,180
Those are actually the only two players I know from Call of Duty.

273
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,480
Oh.

274
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,880
Wait, Huskers and Aiden are in here?

275
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,920
Whoa, okay.

276
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,140
I think...

277
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,160
Yeah, Shifty.

278
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,040
I remember...

279
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,900
Yeah, like Shifty, I know.

280
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,820
I know the other people.

281
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,880
Anyway, that's all I'm saying.

282
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,000
This phone takes visuals to the next level.

283
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,860
It's got a pro-scalar tech that boosts image quality by 40%.

284
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:37,880
And the upgraded ray tracing makes lighting, shadows, and reflections look insanely real in games that support it.

285
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,800
There's also massive immersive display.

286
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,780
Bigger is better, right?

287
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,540
So the S25 Ultra has a sudden 6 point...

288
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,800
Okay, actually, that sold me.

289
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,500
6.9 inches display with...

290
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,100
Nice.

291
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,700
6.9 inch display, nice.

292
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,100
With barely any bezels.

293
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,800
It's like holding the game world right in your hands.

294
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,140
Plus, it has 120 hertz refresh...

295
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,560
Okay, okay, guys.

296
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,380
It's not like this is the first time I read this.

297
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,420
But...

298
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,040
The phone has 120 hertz?

299
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,860
Wait, what?

300
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,620
Oh my god!

301
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,940
Bro, some regular people don't have to have 100...

302
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,340
Like, 120 hertz.

303
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,460
Wait, that's actually pretty crazy.

304
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,260
Yes, this is normal.

305
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,340
Okay, wait, I...

306
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,940
Bro, okay.

307
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,620
Like, I had the game on like 30 frames, guys.

308
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,820
Like, I had a 60 hertz monitor for a PC.

309
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,920
I actually did not know that the phone has 120 hertz.

310
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,600
Wow.

311
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,340
Okay.

312
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,040
I was on the 60 hertz on my PC until last week, and this phone has 120 hertz?

313
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,420
All right, guys.

314
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,180
Okay, so this phone has 120 hertz refresh rate.

315
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,960
Oh my god.

316
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,380
All right, and also you...

317
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,200
Okay, and it's cool under pressure.

318
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,700
So you know how some phones overheat after a while?

319
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,020
Not this one.

320
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,260
It has a large vapor chamber and upgraded...

321
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,700
Oh my god, this phone has a cooling system?

322
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,600
This phone is better than like 50% of PCs around...

323
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,060
80% of PCs.

324
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,580
Okay.

325
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,500
We got slowing down.

326
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,620
It's built for hardcore gamers, guys.

327
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,900
And then there's also comfortable gaming.

328
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,260
So the gaming manifrons just got easier.

329
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,680
The S25 Ultra is slimmer, lighter, and has a rounded display design that feels amazing in your hand.

330
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,560
No more hand cramps during these long sessions, especially if you're playing Gacha.

331
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:49,660
Yeah!

332
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,740
Oh wait, who's the first pick?

333
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,680
Wait, is he a pro?

334
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,560
Is he the pro mobile player?

335
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,380
Oh, he's picking one.

336
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,780
Also, does it sound better, guys?

337
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,060
I could just skip the ads so I could listen to more.

338
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,640
You could listen to the important ads!

339
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,540
That's different, guys.

340
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
My ads are more important.

341
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,220
That is exactly the energy we love to see.

342
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:52,980
All right, man.

343
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,980
Well, we're gonna let you go.

344
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,140
Let you brew and watch to see who's gonna be available for your next pickup that's there.

345
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
But hey, congratulations.

346
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,580
Really good first pickup here.

347
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,140
We'll talk to you in a little bit, my man.

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,520
Thank you, guys.

349
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,400
For sure.

350
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,080
All right, Lucky.

351
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,560
I'm not gonna lie to you.

352
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,340
Wow!

353
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,540
I was not expecting Lucky as the number one overall pick.

354
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,160
I can't believe it.

355
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,400
No shade to Lucky, by the way.

356
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,700
Lucky, he makes a point.

357
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,880
Lucky has played a lot of different tournaments.

358
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,360
He's been playing COD forever.

359
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,880
I would love to be able to...

360
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:23,900
Oh, yeah.

361
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,180
He should use the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra as the mic as well.

362
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,240
Oh, is that the...

363
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Oh, that's the second captain.

364
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,060
How you doing, brother?

365
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,920
I'm doing good.

366
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,520
Doing good.

367
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
I didn't know that.

368
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,220
I didn't know there's 60 plus...

369
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,440
I just didn't know that like some phones have like 120 refresh rates either.

370
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,000
That's actually really cool.

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
That phones have like...

372
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,960
Are now like at that level.

373
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,580
Is it really?

374
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,080
I didn't know that.

375
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,360
No, it's not about having fun anymore.

376
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,960
It's 100k on the line.

377
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,300
I feel like...

378
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,420
I feel like people are like...

379
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,340
We say that just for the sake of it.

380
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,960
Yeah!

381
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,140
You know why, Aiden?

382
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,420
Because everyone...

383
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,740
I recognize who he is.

384
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,060
If I recognize who he is, then he has to be really good.

385
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,040
I don't know.

386
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,200
I just recognized the name.

387
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,860
I was like, wait, I know that name.

388
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,620
I know two people there.

389
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,160
I know like...

390
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,260
Who was...

391
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Okay, I actually already forgot.

392
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,120
Huskers.

393
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,820
It was Aiden and Huskers.

394
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,380
I recognize their names because they've been like around for a while in competitive gaming.

395
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,340
And they're like really well known in the competitive gaming sphere.

396
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,540
So that's why I was like, oh, I recognize them.

397
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,940
Feeling pretty good about this Aiden pick.

398
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,440
All right.

399
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,100
Aiden!

400
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,680
Second overall Seymour.

401
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,140
I mean, this is a player that...

402
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,060
I think he picked him for the right reason.

403
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,200
I have no idea what they do.

404
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,980
Like, I think they're...

405
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,480
I know they're good at FPS games.

406
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,260
Like, I know they're good at shooters.

407
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:32,900
That's like...

408
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,680
Like, I was like, I know your name because you're good at what you do.

409
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,740
I don't know much about you, but I know you're good at what you do.

410
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,880
And when you look at the results that he puts down, has the results to back it.

411
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,480
It's the whole package.

412
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,180
I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and it's pretty awesome.

413
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,940
Yeah, but do you have a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra though?

414
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,400
Yeah, like upgrade to the newest one.

415
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,640
So, I'm a competitive guy and I just love competitive.

416
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,340
And the right pick for that is Shifty because he is, you know, one of the best Warzone players.

417
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,140
And I want my team to be competitive.

418
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,320
Okay, we love it.

419
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,220
Shifty coming on through.

420
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,380
Now, here's the thing though.

421
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,900
Shifty, he's, you know, he's been around the block a little bit when it comes to Call of Duty.

422
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,240
How do you think he's going to fare on the mobile side?

423
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,660
Uh, mobile is sort of like easy to pick up.

424
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,880
You got maps that...

425
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,720
You got OG maps and like the maps...

426
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,500
Yeah, like Rust.

427
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,780
I know what Rust is.

428
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,580
You know, the thing you're like shooting.

429
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,560
That's actually the only map I know.

430
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,140
I was like, just like Rust.

431
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,580
And the other maps.

432
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,620
I don't know the reason why I remember Rust is just because we stuffed 50 dragoons in one map.

433
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,260
One Rust map.

434
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,680
And like you live for like one second.

435
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,700
Oh, I don't have money getting all new phones.

436
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,920
Selling my one kidney and I kind of need it.

437
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,680
You're so partial.

438
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,660
I heard we can like kidneys regrow itself.

439
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:37,600
So like, like if you cut a little bit of the kidney and then like half a kidney, wouldn't you regrow the other half?

440
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:37,960
Yeah.

441
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,560
See?

442
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,970
So like, you just...

443
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,640
Yeah, don't kidneys regenerate?

444
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,820
Oh, that's the liver.

445
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,100
Oh, so you're partially your liver then.

446
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,840
Can't you just sell your liver?

447
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,220
Just cut a little bit of the liver and then like have it regrow itself.

448
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,580
And then...

449
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,300
It's like...

450
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,280
It's like the...

451
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,880
What is it called?

452
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,920
It's like...

453
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,520
Like a...

454
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
Like a life hack.

455
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,920
Unlimited money.

456
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,420
Unlimited money glitch.

457
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,000
No, I'm cutting half.

458
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,980
No, no, no.

459
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,380
No, not half your kidney.

460
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,940
Half your liver.

461
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,980
Get it?

462
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,500
Get it right.

463
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,920
Also, don't do that.

464
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,700
Don't do that, guys.

465
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,560
Don't do that, guys.

466
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,520
Your liver is...

467
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,960
For legal...

468
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,240
For legal reasons.

469
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,680
That is a joke, guys.

470
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,280
That is a joke.

471
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,980
Right?

472
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,200
I think the first pick is clear.

473
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,980
I'm going Destroy, 100%.

474
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,560
Yes, I think that you picked...

475
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,740
For your omission, that might be the number one guy you want on your team.

476
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,820
It's the pick.

477
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,040
I mean, how many times do we look at Destroy when he's on stream or when he's competing on LAN?

478
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,120
And he's standing up, yelling at the person next to him.

479
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,720
Instructions unclear.

480
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,760
I don't have half of the liver in me now.

481
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,800
He's fun.

482
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,120
He's competitive.

483
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,340
He's extremely nice.

484
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,420
Yeah, but you talk to him and this guy is like happy to have a conversation, happy to learn.

485
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,400
And he is so humble.

486
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,300
But you don't want to get on his bad side.

487
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,840
When you get on his bad side, you're going to learn.

488
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,440
Wow.

489
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,180
That's OK.

490
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,500
I need something from you, Zim, though.

491
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,660
If you guys win a map, I need you to get Destroy to get up and yell, give me my money.

492
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,480
That's all I need.

493
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,340
That's your job as the coach.

494
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,000
OK.

495
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,540
Of course.

496
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,060
Thank you.

497
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:02,960
All right.

498
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,680
Well, we're keeping...

499
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,260
We're continuing the vibe, Copsquad.

500
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,060
So you got our second pick now coming on the backswing.

501
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,180
Who's going to be your second pick here today, Zim?

502
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,460
You see, and this is where they messed up.

503
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,700
They gave me fourth place.

504
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,820
So I got two picks.

505
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,300
I'm going...

506
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Maybe you play better if you're fourth place, I guess.

507
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,200
That's what you get.

508
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,520
Not be flashy.

509
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,060
Lock in.

510
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,520
What do you mean they gave you fourth place?

511
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,520
It was a draft pick.

512
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,940
You want to talk about putting together guys that are going to slam and give that energy too.

513
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,960
And I can bring that as well.

514
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,540
You got a game.

515
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,920
You got to lock in.

516
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,860
If you don't want fourth place, you got to lock in.

517
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,620
He needs to say about Hisoka.

518
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,020
He is a beast and he is a winner.

519
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,060
And so it's like you look at a pick like that and you're doing good at putting together probably one of my favorite squads right now.

520
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,040
Yeah.

521
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,160
You're looking good already, Zim.

522
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,120
But you got a little bit of time to wait until we come on back to you.

523
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,040
Unfortunately, I think you're already maybe putting some pressure on some of the other squads.

524
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,000
So we'll talk to you a little bit, my man.

525
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,220
I'm curious to see when he kind of comes back to you.

526
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,440
Who's still on the board.

527
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,000
We'll see you here in a little bit.

528
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,580
Wow.

529
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,780
I mean, I think he hit it right on the head.

530
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,820
You were kind of wondering, like, how does Hisoka drop all the way down to a fourth pick?

531
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,640
And he says, hey, I'm building out the vibe squad that's here to win.

532
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,880
I think you got the two number overall picks.

533
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,820
And that's your goal here.

534
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,380
Yeah.

535
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,180
Guys, are you struggling to watch Jokeyboy streams?

536
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,040
Are you struggling to see chat?

537
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,260
Then look no further with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

538
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,040
You can enjoy Jokeyboy's stream to the fullest and free subscription unincluded.

539
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,120
Thank you for doing the...

540
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,580
Thank you for giving me like a little disclaimer right at the bottom there to make sure everybody knows that.

541
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,680
So many teams or so many players still ready to get picked up and it's like...

542
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,140
Oh, I was like, isn't that...

543
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,440
Oh, okay.

544
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,500
So when they're picked up, they're like linked out as like an ad memorial thing.

545
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,880
A lot of great names still on the board, but we're gonna...

546
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,900
Wait, Huskers is not picked up yet?

547
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,840
Drop on in.

548
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,840
Let us know their second pick.

549
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,340
So Marsha, I said it was gonna be too long.

550
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,540
I thought Huskers would get picked.

551
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,960
You said you want to be competitive.

552
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,440
You want to bring it on forward.

553
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,980
Is he Wash?

554
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,340
Shifty in the last round.

555
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:23,780
No.

556
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,000
Give me your second pick here, my guy.

557
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,380
I recognize his name, though.

558
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,520
My second pick will be Adrian.

559
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,240
Who's Adrian?

560
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,260
Lil A, the young gun.

561
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,960
Why Adrian?

562
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,680
Honestly, I don't know.

563
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,160
I don't know who else to pick.

564
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,900
What do you mean you don't know?

565
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,180
You're gonna have a little bit of time to think.

566
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,140
What do you mean?

567
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,500
What?

568
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,720
That can't just be a reason.

569
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
He's a vibe.

570
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,040
I think he's fitting your style where he's cool.

571
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,840
Did you just like his name?

572
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,760
Let me tell you what.

573
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,400
There ain't many people in the game who shoot straighter than he does.

574
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,940
So I think he's gonna be, you know, he's gonna look to you and say, all right, yo, tell me where to post on up.

575
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,440
Tell me where to shoot my gun.

576
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,460
And he might be able to bring you some solid cash.

577
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,180
That is true.

578
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,980
Because he's younger with better reflexes.

579
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,340
I mean, that's a good point.

580
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,120
That's a good point.

581
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,700
The vibe drafting.

582
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,440
He passed the vibe draft.

583
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,700
I mean, that guy looks like he's vibed, though.

584
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,020
He looks like he's vibing.

585
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,680
Why did you pick Adrian?

586
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,460
I don't know.

587
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,560
There's just something about him.

588
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,680
He doesn't know who to pick up.

589
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,680
Phone a friend.

590
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,960
Phone one of the players you like.

591
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,600
I didn't!

592
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,920
He's like arresting his ass!

593
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,260
What?

594
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,960
You got a walking encyclopedia right here.

595
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,180
You're like, I can't believe you didn't research your players.

596
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,300
What do you mean?

597
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,120
I don't know.

598
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,180
Who's the good pick right now?

599
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,180
Who do the players want to play with too?

600
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,080
Who do they want to have on their team?

601
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,600
And I'm sure they are going to have so many options to pick from.

602
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,000
I think it's a great call out.

603
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,360
Ask some of your teammates that you've already picked on ups and hey, who on this list do you want to play with?

604
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,480
If you don't really have an idea.

605
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,080
I'd love that.

606
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,960
I see more.

607
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,480
Hopefully, some of our players are listening.

608
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,540
But let's go ahead.

609
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,480
We'll bring in Jez here for their second pick.

610
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,240
Jez, how you doing, my man?

611
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,600
Same, same, man.

612
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,500
Still good.

613
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,160
Just a little...

614
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,440
I don't really know who to pick right now, you know?

615
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,740
Wait, you don't know either?

616
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,780
It's a tough thing.

617
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,300
There's so many to pick from too.

618
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,660
You have to have a list.

619
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,500
Very tough.

620
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,720
Who are you leaning towards?

621
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,580
Who are you looking at?

622
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,800
Who's maybe on your radar?

623
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,400
Maybe you've heard about them before.

624
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,880
Anybody you're kind of wobbling between, you know?

625
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,780
Wobbling between Huskers.

626
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,580
Yeah, Huskies!

627
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,280
Possibly Santana.

628
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Some good picks.

629
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,680
Or rated, yeah.

630
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,520
Huskers are rated, actually, yeah.

631
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,580
Wait, so then when we were watching the rest match, those were all...

632
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,900
That was all, like, the mobile pro players.

633
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,140
Okay, those are some crazy movements, though.

634
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,980
That's crazy.

635
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,780
I know more of Huskers, so I think I'm gonna go with Huskers, yeah.

636
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,280
Final answer?

637
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,720
Final, final, final answer.

638
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,060
Lock it in.

639
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,240
Lock it in!

640
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,520
He's picking up Huskers.

641
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,480
Hey, if it makes you feel better, I think Huskers is a great pickup for you.

642
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,960
Coming on in, so, you know, I know...

643
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,000
How old is Huskers?

644
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,960
Now I'm curious.

645
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,400
Huskers.

646
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,600
I think you're probably pretty aware of Huskers.

647
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,400
Is there anything...

648
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,340
Yeah, I was like, everyone knows who he is.

649
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,920
Is Huskers overrated or Santana?

650
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,740
Oh, he's been around for...

651
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,680
Yeah, I knew it!

652
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,320
He has one...

653
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,220
Yeah, it was like...

654
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,060
Yeah, that's why I remember him.

655
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,040
He's, like, really well known.

656
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,960
Huskers also know more about him.

657
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,800
Especially what his mouse and key is.

658
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,540
It's crazy.

659
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,780
Yeah, he's, like, one of the most well-known Call of Duty players.

660
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,020
That's why I know him!

661
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,200
I think Huskers is gonna definitely come on in and be able to...

662
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,720
Let me just see how that translates into mobile.

663
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,740
I mean, like, when you're...

664
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,160
It's, like, all the hand-eye coordination.

665
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,200
So it's not like it's gonna be, like, a huge change in terms of, like, gameplay.

666
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,300
Because it's all, like, you know, it's all...

667
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,240
That's a good pick.

668
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,740
It's all, like, hand-eye coordination, everything.

669
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,040
Throughout everybody on this list.

670
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,840
And if I was in their shoes, I would also be, like, hey, okay.

671
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,180
I mean, like, I'm stuck between, like, the best in the world and the best in the world right now.

672
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,320
It's, like, you don't know what to pick at that point.

673
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,920
So many good options.

674
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,360
I think being stuck between, you know, Huskers and Raid is a good call.

675
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,720
Say, Tana, if you're watching this, I mean, I'm sorry, man.

676
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,020
I don't know why he had to do that.

677
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,300
Yeah, they're all playing on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

678
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,640
Because it's trying to, like, showcase, like, the gameplay of Call of Duty.

679
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,660
Especially on mobile.

680
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,020
Because Call of Duty, in general, is, like, super intensive.

681
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,100
In general.

682
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,120
And so, because, like...

683
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,600
It's, like, a good, like...

684
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,620
What's the word called?

685
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,680
It's a good stress test, in a way.

686
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,160
Especially if it's for, like, $100,000.

687
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,680
It's a really good stress test on, like, to showcase how well it runs on the Samsung phone.

688
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,560
Yeah, benchmark.

689
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,760
It's, like, a field test.

691
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,560
Space.

692
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,660
Space.

693
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,000
Why does this read, like...

694
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,940
They're, like...

695
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,060
It says a draft pick.

696
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,420
So, they're, literally, like, drafting the players for the team.

697
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,160
I think I'm gonna have to go with Shifty, man.

698
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,440
Wait, I know Shifty!

699
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,880
Shifty's already been picked by Marshii.

700
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,200
Has anyone been picked?

701
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,780
It's okay.

702
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,020
He's, like, I'm gonna go with Shifty!

703
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,020
Aww!

704
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,040
He's been picked since the first pick.

705
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,160
He's so confident!

706
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,340
That's funny.

707
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,800
That's funny.

708
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,380
He's, like, Shifty's pick?

709
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,860
Yeah, he's been picked since first pick.

710
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,140
I'd like to steal him!

711
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,440
I'd like to steal a player, please!

712
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,140
It's, like, that...

713
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,240
It's, like, that game where you could, like...

714
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,820
You, like...

715
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,260
That game where you, like, stole...

716
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,880
You stole someone else's Pokémon.

717
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,560
You're, like, I'd like to steal a player.

718
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,380
Oh, yeah.

719
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,220
The refresh rate for the Samsung Galaxy is 120Hz.

720
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,260
Yeah, I got to pick it.

721
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,180
It was, literally, like...

722
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,840
Couldn't come up with anything.

723
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,520
Hit the drawing board.

724
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm, like, okay.

725
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,020
What's a play on words?

726
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,920
Has to do with space.

727
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,680
Let's go with it.

728
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,160
That simple?

729
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,840
That we're just pulling branding goodness out of the brain?

730
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,140
Okay.

731
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,860
It's perfect.

732
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,540
You might be multi-talented here, man.

733
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,580
The six-finger claw.

734
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,940
You're coming out with the branding.

735
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,300
I love it.

736
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,780
But, okay.

737
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,820
You're here on the bend.

738
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
We're gonna give you your time while we have you here.

739
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,160
Give us the first pick of round number three.

740
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,840
Who's helping round out your squad here?

741
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,100
We're going with rated, man.

742
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,460
Going with rated.

743
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,820
Why rated?

744
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,820
Former pro.

745
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,640
He's got the energy.

746
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,440
He's got what it takes.

747
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,220
Aren't they all former pros?

748
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,020
I mean, he asked for the reasons.

749
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,200
I just want to have a fun time.

750
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,220
I just want to hang out.

751
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,080
And then, when it comes down to brass tacks, you're like...

752
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,560
I think they...

753
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,140
Aren't they all...

754
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,180
He's on 100 Cs.

755
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,040
It's going to win.

756
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,880
I love it, man.

757
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,260
I think this is a great pickup.

758
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,220
Rated E.

759
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,100
I was thinking, like...

760
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,760
Aren't they all technically former pros slash pros?

761
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,200
They don't come back to you, right?

762
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,540
I think until your final pick.

763
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,480
That's coming on in, man.

764
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,820
So, you got some time to brew.

765
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,600
Well, actually, you don't even get to make your last pick.

766
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,800
Now that I think about it.

767
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,360
Aren't they all like former pros slash current pros?

768
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,340
I'm pretty sure.

769
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,360
Until we come back to you.

770
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:07,060
Throw out some names that you hope somehow magically drop to you that maybe don't go picked overall that you think maybe some people might overlook that you're hoping drop on down.

771
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,440
Man, I don't know, man.

772
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,040
Maybe Nyxta.

773
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,860
I've seen some of his streams before.

774
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,020
Uh...

775
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,940
I have no clue.

776
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,100
I have no clue what to expect.

777
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,340
Absolutely no idea.

778
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,540
Wait, which was the non-pro?

779
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,700
Why would you do that to him?

780
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,580
Hahaha!

781
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,780
The one non-pro.

782
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,980
A poor guy.

783
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,000
But the content though.

784
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,780
Yeah!

785
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,400
That's what I said!

786
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,520
Talk about the refresh rate!

787
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,440
Of course.

788
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,320
Yeah!

789
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,760
Oh, wait!

790
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,760
There's more capt...

791
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,200
Oh, wait!

792
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,060
I was gonna say like...

793
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,340
I thought it was four captains.

794
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,880
I was like, more captains?

795
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,920
When did they add in the rest of the captains?

796
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,600
The comments about Santana.

797
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,040
No, there's a lot of like...

798
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,720
Okay, so like mobile gaming is actually like really popular in terms of like eSports scene.

799
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,920
Because they're like...

800
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,840
Um...

801
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,520
Oh my gosh.

802
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,140
I like...

803
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,440
Especially in Asia.

804
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,620
Because there's like...

805
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,260
There's like...

806
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,940
Um...

807
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,000
There's like so many other games.

808
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Because I know there's like...

809
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:32,020
The amount of money that mobile gaming can invest in eSports is actually crazy.

810
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,860
Yeah, it's really big.

811
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,220
Especially in Asia too.

812
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,500
I've seen...

813
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,780
I've actually watched a couple of like mobile eSports.

814
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,880
Like uh...

815
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,120
Mobile eSports streams.

816
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,780
Just because I was curious on like the LAN events of mobile gaming.

817
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,680
And the amount...

818
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,020
Like the prize pool is actually insane for mobile gaming.

819
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,820
Because the amount of money...

820
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,400
I think mobile gaming is like the most money you can get.

821
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,460
Especially from like...

822
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,500
Um...

823
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,120
The most gaming you can...

824
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,260
You can uh...

825
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,640
The most money you can earn from eSports in general.

826
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,980
Yeah, PUBG mobile is like...

827
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,460
PUBG mobile is like really popular.

828
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,470
Like um...

829
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,930
What was it?

830
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,730
I think like...

831
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,230
There's like a MOBA game in mobile.

832
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,330
MOBA in mobile.

833
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,150
That's like incredibly popular in Southeast Asia.

834
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,610
I don't remember what it's called.

835
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,990
But it's like incredibly competitive.

836
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,290
And like really, really like what like...

837
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,670
It has like...

838
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,290
Like the prize pool is like insane.

839
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,070
...to Marshy.

840
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,990
I mean we heard Nyxta get mentioned.

841
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,670
We heard uh...

842
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,410
Let's see who else?

843
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,850
We heard a couple people get mentioned in here as well.

844
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,330
Some big names that I'm surprised have gone undrafted.

845
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:56,990
Let's be honest.

846
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,330
You know what?

847
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,430
And I just had like...

848
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,150
An epiphany.

849
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,170
Okay.

850
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,230
How have we not seen SpacePickupKnight?

851
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,510
Like he's literally would fit the Nebula Knights if you have Knight on.

852
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,230
What if he's a bad player?

853
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,090
Or not bad player.

854
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,930
But like what if like he's not the best player?

855
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,270
Maybe he's not...

856
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,330
He's just not first and second pick, guys.

857
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,290
Guys, it's 100k.

858
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,530
It's not about the memes anymore.

859
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,810
Like why did he say it like that?

860
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,350
Why don't you pick Knight in the Nebula Knights?

861
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,390
That's peer pressure.

862
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,600
Like why is he not picking the Knight?

863
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,860
Okay, let's see if Nebula Knights pick Knight.

864
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,500
I want a different team to pick Knight just for the memes.

865
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,300
The gamers.

866
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,260
One of the guys...

867
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,220
You just even look at him.

868
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,640
Just like how I was saying about Shifty earlier when you just...

869
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,520
You just look at him.

870
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,460
It's just aura.

871
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,280
The bandana, just like the serious face.

872
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,660
The glow of red coming out from the lighting.

873
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,600
The aura.

874
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,180
Look at his aura, bro.

875
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,680
Just look at him.

876
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,500
You got one more coming down the pipe.

877
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,420
Bro, he's a gamer.

878
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,800
So anybody you're kind of keeping your eye out on?

879
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,340
Anybody you're hoping that somehow makes it back over to you?

880
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,580
Honestly, some of my picks are stolen so I don't even know anymore.

881
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,500
You're supposed to have plan A, B, C, D, E, F.

882
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:51,940
What do you mean?

883
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,580
There's so many players that haven't been picked yet, bro.

884
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,700
Wait,

885
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,600
what?

886
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,560
I remember that guy because he didn't shout for like two weeks when...

887
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,740
When Black Ops 6...

888
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,220
Wait, is that true?

889
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,460
I can't tell.

890
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,200
I feel like that's something...

891
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,220
That's something a gamer would do.

892
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,280
Wait, what?

893
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,460
Is that actually true?

894
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,260
But like...

895
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,300
You don't even have to take a long shower.

896
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,660
If you can't eat, you can shower.

897
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,440
That's a different...

898
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,340
Guys, I don't think he has aura right now.

899
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,820
I don't think...

900
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,880
Guys, the aura has been revoked.

901
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,120
No, no, Doki.

902
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,400
Max aura.

903
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,980
I'm just saying if you can eat, you can shower.

904
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,620
Like it doesn't even have to be a fast shower.

905
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,140
Oh, that's true.

906
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,660
He can't be washed if you never shower.

907
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,640
That's how you lose your gaming ability.

908
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,340
That is actually so true.

909
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,460
Can't be washed if you can't...

910
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,180
If you never...

911
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,700
Shower.

912
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,000
Playing multiplayer back in the day.

913
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,680
So Gorgonite is my pick.

914
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,700
This is the guy who competed alongside CDL Talent right now.

915
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,180
In Long Flames, Astrial, Capsule, you name it.

916
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:57,880
This guy's been on teams with players who have been at the top of Call of Duty on multiple different titles, multiple different inputs.

917
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,300
And this is...

918
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm just as surprised as you are in seeing how far he's dropped down this list.

919
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,280
What the...

920
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,980
Okay, that profile picture.

921
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,720
Wait, did they even pick him in the night?

922
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,240
Oh, wait.

923
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,340
The Nubile Knights never even picked him up.

924
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,440
Yeah, what is...

925
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,200
That is his Twitch icon, right?

926
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,560
Wait, how many players are in...

927
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,060
Bro, he's like, I don't know who he is.

928
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,960
But his name's freaking dope.

929
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,300
His name is so cool.

930
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,920
Wait, aren't you...

931
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,300
You got 4th in your draft pick.

932
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,660
You got 4th in your...

933
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,060
You got 4th in your draft pick.

934
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:20,920
Valid.

935
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,540
Okay, you know what?

936
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,500
It's up by his enthusiasm.

937
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,140
He can turn it around.

938
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,140
He can train his team to be better than his...

939
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,460
He can train his team, I believe.

940
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,760
Also, Delta, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

941
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,740
Thank you, thank you.

942
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,660
And Oda, thank you for the tier 1.

943
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,620
Thank you, thank you.

944
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,840
I like how he's just like, I think his name is pretty dope.

945
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,300
I don't know who he is, but man, Spartacus.

946
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,040
I don't know.

947
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,860
A lot of them were like, I just think they're...

948
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,980
He seems...

949
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,260
A lot of the picks were like, his photo is really cool.

950
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,540
I mean, they're not picking off based off...

951
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,660
I guess because they don't know exactly what their skills are in mobile gaming.

952
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,360
So they're just trying to be like...

953
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,760
Oh, wait, there's still a few people left.

954
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,580
One, two, three.

955
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,840
There's still three more people left.

956
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,580
I think that's also the case.

957
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:44,420
They're just trying to figure out who's going to be able to translate their...

958
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,720
Who's going to be able to translate the gameplay into mobile.

959
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,560
It is different.

960
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,520
Oh, okay.

961
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,500
So he saw his live stream on TikTok.

962
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,380
And that's basically it.

963
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,500
Oh, he's the king of Rebirth.

964
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,360
I'll tell you that much.

965
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,380
The king of Rebirth Island.

966
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,900
Absolutely a shooter.

967
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,460
I think you hit the nail on the head.

968
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,800
A fantastic person.

969
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,340
He'll bring the...

970
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,800
I think he's going to fit your system well.

971
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,700
Like somebody who's going to help bring the vibes.

972
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,440
But he's competitive.

973
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,480
He's been playing Call of Duty a long time.

974
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,120
So I know you might not be super knowledgeable about him.

975
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,520
But definitely go check out his streams and stuff.

976
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,340
He's a cool kid.

977
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,320
All right.

978
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,100
Whoa, whoa.

979
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,680
Good job.

980
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,800
Thank you, Marshii for that pick.

981
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,200
Rounding it on out.

982
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,320
We'll talk to you here in a little bit.

983
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,700
We get all the captains back on.

984
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,700
And Nyxta, you were kind of wondering, Seymour.

985
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,960
How does Nyxta drop all the way down here?

986
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,280
Finally gets picked up by Marshii to round out the squad.

987
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,440
Yeah, man.

988
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,660
I mean, you said it yourself.

989
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,440
The king of Rebirth.

990
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,400
He's like waiting for a reply.

991
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,480
He's like, all right, everyone.

992
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,460
Let's just go back to the casters.

993
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,960
I'd say that you have that high octane fast decision making.

994
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,960
Casters, their entire job is to talk.

995
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,100
It's just like regular stream.

996
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,840
Like prim players, their entire job is just a game, basically.

997
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,400
Casters, their entire job is to talk.

998
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,940
So they're like, that's literally what they're supposed to be doing.

999
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,180
Yeah, the pro yappers.

1000
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,080
I'm kind of curious.

1001
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,360
Have you done some research?

1002
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,600
Who is going to be your last and final pick?

1003
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,720
And they're like, so did you do your research?

1004
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,480
I've done some research.

1005
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,940
It's like the...

1006
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,200
Probably like when you get...

1007
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,940
When I got towards the end of the draft is the ones I really didn't know the most about, you know?

1008
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:53,960
Yeah.

1009
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:58,120
It's like this can be some very like game-changing pick right here.

1010
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,120
Yeah, and it's...

1011
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,020
As of right now, I know...

1012
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,280
Oh, the anticipation.

1013
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,460
...played in the Twitch Rivals.

1014
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,700
Mm-hmm.

1015
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,320
So...

1016
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,180
I played in Twitch Rivals, too.

1017
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,820
...go there for Cindy.

1018
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,520
Just because...

1019
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,480
That's funny.

1020
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,460
Alright, Noemi, Cindy Noemi coming on.

1021
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,580
What about the other girl?

1022
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,740
What did she do?

1023
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,460
Realistically, right?

1024
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,800
I mean, that's kind of the fun part.

1025
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,340
So yeah, I mean, there's a good shout out recently.

1026
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,760
Yeah, I was in Twitch Rivals.

1027
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,560
Where's me?

1028
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,240
A very strong, strong competitor coming on.

1029
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,620
And I think this is a great shout out for you.

1030
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,060
How are you feeling about the squad, man?

1031
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,760
I think I'm feeling good.

1032
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,920
Just really excited to like meet them and...

1033
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:40,340
Sorry.

1034
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,400
I played a tournament.

1035
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,600
Oh, I heard there's gonna be like practice streams, too.

1036
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,380
I mean, it'd be interesting to see how they go about...

1037
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,400
...in the coming weeks.

1038
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,460
But hey, I mean, we love having you in here.

1039
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,320
Thanks for your picks.

1040
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,380
We'll see you in a little bit when we bring in all the captains.

1041
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,420
But final pick there for Jez coming on through.

1042
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,900
Noemi, I love to see...

1043
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,140
I mean, it's kind of a shame to see both Primrose and Noemi go this far all the way down.

1044
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,360
But we kind of talked about earlier.

1045
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,300
Reality is it had to be somebody, right?

1046
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,820
Yeah, someone had to be the last pick.

1047
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,000
The last pick at the event.

1048
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,060
Yeah, so this is just the draft pick, so...

1049
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,740
No, no, no.

1050
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,780
The tournament...

1051
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,040
The finals is April 25th at 5 p.m.

1052
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,340
PST.

1053
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,780
So there's going to be a second stream for the finals.

1054
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,700
And it's going to be happening in Las Vegas, too.

1055
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,220
Because they're making a lot out of this.

1056
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,420
So the finals on April 25th.

1057
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,440
Well,

1058
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,040
I mean, it's usually the first pick person...

1059
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,700
The first or second pick person that's...

1060
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,000
It's second.

1061
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,320
So the second pick guy basically...

1062
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,080
Gets the...

1063
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,400
Gets the last pick.

1064
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,280
So this guy is like the second best God mobile player.

1065
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:15,900
Oh!

1066
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,640
Yeah.

1067
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:16,960
See?

1068
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,520
Winning vibes.

1069
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,360
The draft went by so fast.

1070
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,680
People like...

1071
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,560
Sort of like knew instantly what they want.

1072
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,320
Wait, what?

1073
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,600
Nightpick's so late?

1074
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,240
Is he like a secret weapon?

1075
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,480
Why was he such a late pick if he's...

1076
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,380
If he's really good?

1077
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,540
Wait,

1078
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,480
really?

1079
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,940
He got the best players?

1080
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,060
Oh, okay.

1081
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,300
Yeah.

1082
00:55:59,380 --> 00:55:59,660
He...

1083
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,140
Wait, okay.

1084
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,100
No, maybe his team's gonna win.

1085
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,320
No, I...

1086
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,980
He's a coach.

1087
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,640
Never mind.

1088
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,980
His team is actually has the best potential to win.

1089
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,000
Okay.

1090
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,820
No, that makes worse sense.

1091
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,560
I was like...

1092
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,480
No, his team actually might be the best team.

1093
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,100
Because like the other three players did not reason.

1094
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,140
Bro was actually...

1095
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,900
It was just those coach things.

1096
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,400
Other three were just...

1097
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,640
We're just here to game.

1098
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,300
A good coach can change an entire team.

1099
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:34,500
Basically.

1100
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,340
Yeah, because he like actually...

1101
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
He actually looked over stuff.

1102
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,320
Oh my god, he actually did research.

1103
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,960
Like, damn, we got a squad that can go and do some stuff.

1104
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:05,520
Go and win.

1105
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,100
The other three players are like, I carry.

1106
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,380
But then because like I feel like...

1107
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,100
It depends on like what exactly the matches are gonna go.

1108
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:24,840
But if it's a very team-reliant game, then like it would make sense if like Zim can like basically buff up the entire team with just personal coaching and stuff.

1109
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,860
Yeah, and the other three players are just playing with the mindset with like, I can carry this team.

1110
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,500
I'm feeling confident.

1111
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,460
I mean, me, I didn't do much research.

1112
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,600
I mean, I tried, but I just couldn't really get down to the fine detail.

1113
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,180
But I'm still feeling good.

1114
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,160
Still feeling good about it.

1115
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,660
Okay, I mean, as long as you're feeling good, that's what matters at the end of the day.

1116
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,000
Marsha, I'm gonna go to you next.

1117
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:58,200
I mean, you were kind of the first vocal one who said, no, I want a squad that's gonna come out and say, I want the shooters who are bringing the vibes.

1118
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,380
And I think you might have assembled the Avengers.

1119
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,080
The vibe Avengers.

1120
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,080
Obviously, when you're getting ready to look at LAN and be competitive to be here.

1121
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,560
Any sort of tips and tricks you're going to be given some of these?

1122
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,300
One player pro can do a lot in COD, but many...

1123
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,540
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

1124
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:24,120
Like, I was like, because I remember when we played COD, one player can just hit like a 60 bomb or something and just like farm the weaker players over and over again.

1125
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,260
But then I feel like if they can...

1126
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:37,300
The thing is, if they have a team of weaker players on the mobile team, then that team is going to be the one that's getting farmed, you know?

1127
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:47,520
So like, if they train up all of them, then it's harder to farm the weaker players if there's no weak players.

1128
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:57,340
And then the non-mobile players can just try to farm the other non-mobile players, whoever the weaker ones are.

1129
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,780
Because like, that's the bad part of having a weak link.

1130
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,080
Like, they're the ones that are going to be farmed over and over and over again.

1131
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,640
Especially for COD, when like the time to kill is so fast.

1132
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,500
Like, that's the biggest thing.

1133
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,680
The time to kill was so fast.

1134
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,320
Like, during the drafting round, that was so fast.

1135
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,460
Because like, now I know why they're like, oh, they're trying to make it flashy.

1136
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,840
Because like, I didn't realize that like, that game, that was it.

1137
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,620
Like, I was like, wow, that last...

1138
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,560
That was incredibly fast because of time to kill.

1139
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,720
It was like, so short.

1140
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,840
Then they're all like, really, really good too.

1141
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,620
It was on Rust, yeah.

1142
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,180
Like, they were like, you're...

1143
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,140
That was like, you're going down.

1144
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,240
I mean, they get a free trip to Vegas.

1145
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,800
And the Samson get to use the Samson Galaxy S25 Ultra.

1146
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,320
Oh, they have lightning fast team.

1147
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,640
I feel like mobile gaming...

1148
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,020
Has like, more investment in general.

1149
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,420
In terms of like, gameplay and stuff.

1150
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,470
Because like...

1151
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:36,480
Because like, I remembered when Apex got a mobile game.

1152
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,620
And like, the amount of stuff they put in Apex mobile was insane compared to the actual game.

1153
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:47,100
There's so many quality of life changes that they put in there.

1154
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,460
That was never like, transferred over to the actual...

1155
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,460
To like, the main game.

1156
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,180
Yeah.

1157
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,300
I'm sad they like, shut the mobile game.

1158
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,920
I feel like there was just a huge potential on it.

1159
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,240
Alright, yeah.

1160
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,320
Oh, he actually knows what guns they use.

1161
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,040
Like...

1162
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,100
Bro!

1163
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,280
The other three were like, who's this guy?

1164
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,560
This guy was like, I know exactly what guns they use.

1165
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,580
I like, he has a list.

1166
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,700
He has like, a list and like, all the actual like, statistics and everything.

1167
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,260
Bro actually did his research.

1168
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,820
He actually watched streams.

1169
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,190
He actually did his homework.

1170
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:21,350
Oh, it's single elimination too.

1171
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:23,570
That's scary.

1172
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:28,550
Because of how fast these games are, single elimination is actually so fast.

1173
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,590
Yeah, it's...

1174
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,030
He won Twitch Rivals?

1175
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:46,690
Bro, what?

1176
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,150
Why didn't they...

1177
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,850
Did they...

1178
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:49,730
Bro, just...

1179
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:50,710
They could have googled.

1180
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,350
They knew that who was in there.

1181
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,410
...keep flaming him.

1182
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:55,590
Picks up Huskers.

1183
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:57,470
I think it's between Huskers and Rated.

1184
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:02,170
Well, he grabs Huskers but thankfully for him, Dante still there on the back side.

1185
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:09,310
Had that kind of last choice between, you know, either obviously coming on in and being able to pick up, you know, do you want Noemi?

1186
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,290
Do you want Primrose?

1187
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,210
Goes for Noemi.

1188
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,690
I think that's gonna be a fun squad to watch in Vegas.

1189
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,130
Let's talk a little bit about this Nebula...

1190
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,170
It's just a draft day.

1191
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:21,110
The actual games will be on the 25th.

1192
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:25,330
So we're just learning about the players right now and like who they're drafting.

1193
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:29,690
Like I said, you know, Knight could have had his evolution into like the next...

1194
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:33,650
I mean, the thing is all the non-mobile players are starting off zero.

1195
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,610
So they have a huge room to grow.

1196
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,570
Because like what I think is that...

1197
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:44,690
This is how I feel about when players learn a new game or learn a new character.

1198
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,990
It's easier to train a player when they're starting off zero.

1199
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:54,150
Because they have no background knowledge of like other mechanics and stuff.

1200
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:58,510
So like I assume a lot of these players in the original in the...

1201
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,050
Oh my god, thank you for the raid!

1202
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,570
Sakura, thank you so much for the raid!

1203
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,190
I hope you have a great stream!

1204
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,530
For those who are new here, my name is Dante.

1205
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,690
I'm currently doing a...

1206
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:18,270
I am currently looking at the draft day for the gear up draft.

1207
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:20,830
Powered by Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

1208
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:22,370
Well, hello everybody!

1209
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:23,190
Hello, hello!

1210
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,490
I usually stream on YouTube.

1211
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:30,850
But today, I have a stream presented by Samsung Galaxy.

1212
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,230
Samsung.

1213
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,790
So that's why I'm on Twitch right now.

1214
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,010
But thank you everybody for coming!

1215
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,530
Thank you so much for the raid!

1216
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,930
I really appreciate it!

1217
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:41,970
Hello, hello!

1218
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:45,250
Okay, so there's draft day.

1219
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:47,990
So these are like all the players that are doing their practice streams.

1220
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:51,610
So if you guys want to see how they do...

1221
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,190
Honestly, which one was Zim's team?

1222
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,950
I'd be interested to...

1223
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,770
Yeah, the rare Twitch Doki.

1224
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:24,410
Yeah, how's it gonna be?

1225
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,810
Okay, best of five.

1226
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,130
Snake style.

1227
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,470
I always feel like it's...

1228
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,170
Okay, yeah.

1229
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:39,190
There's 16 Call of Duty pros and influencers.

1230
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,150
I hope they have like at least like four influencers.

1231
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:47,550
I feel like each team should have like a mandatory pick of the influencers.

1232
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,210
Because it's not fair to like...

1233
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:50,830
I feel like it's...

1234
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,110
I'm not saying it's not fair.

1235
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,970
But like it is harder for them.

1236
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:55,110
Also, Medi!

1237
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,310
Thank you for gifting a tier 1 sub for Abra Kadabra.

1238
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,550
Thank you, thank you!

1239
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,310
At least everybody.

1240
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,870
Yeah, everybody wins something too.

1241
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,230
Hard point.

1242
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,450
Call of Duty Mobile Pros 1v1 free-for-all.

1243
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:13,930
What's hard point?

1244
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,610
Best of five.

1245
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:23,450
One, two, three, four, five.

1246
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,230
So then it'll stop at free-for-all.

1247
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,830
Free-for-all, Zim.

1248
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,970
It could stop at free-for-all or search and destroy.

1249
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:33,670
Oh, is it control points?

1250
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:34,250
Okay.

1251
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:36,430
So they do have...

1252
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:36,750
Wait.

1253
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:41,410
Call of Duty Mobile Pros 1v1 free-for-all.

1254
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,470
Is it just the team captains?

1255
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,890
Is the 1v1 free-for-all just for team captains?

1256
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:48,990
Oh, the show matches.

1257
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:50,330
That's the fun part.

1258
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,450
First place gonna pick up that $10,000.

1259
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,130
Second place to pick up the $5,000.

1260
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,850
I think lots to look forward to when we get to that LAN.

1261
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,330
Lots of free-for-all.

1262
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,650
Lots of opportunities to earn this $100,000.

1263
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:09,930
I think if you're interested in how the Call of Duty matches will become the mobile matches.

1264
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:14,250
The practice room would be a good time to watch and see.

1265
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,170
And to see how they grow from there.

1266
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:21,270
And learn from...

1267
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,890
Learn Call of Duty Mobile.

1268
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,370
Because they're usually the ones where they're explaining the mechanics and everything, too.

1269
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:30,730
Can I join the show match?

1270
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,770
Allow me to Las Vegas.

1271
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:45,050
Guys, exclamation point leveled up in chat, guys.

1272
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,510
No, I'll do it.

1273
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:48,310
Oh, wait.

1274
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,130
I have incognito mode.

1275
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:51,950
I can't.

1276
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,510
I have to be off of...

1277
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,930
Guys, exclamation point leveled up.

1278
01:07:58,690 --> 01:07:59,430
I can't.

1279
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:00,670
I'm on incog.

1280
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,270
Wait, most powerful processor?

1281
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:12,990
That's nice, though.

1282
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,350
I hate it when phones like...

1283
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:14,930
Like,

1284
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:21,590
if you play too long on your phone, it heats up and stuff.

1285
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,950
That's really good.

1286
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:38,610
I mean, that's true.

1287
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,790
I mean, like, that's true of your career.

1288
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:46,590
It guards, like, graphics and stuff, too.

1289
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,570
Got, like, better...

1290
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:49,730
Better gear for it.

1291
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,710
Yeah, serious phones are serious, guys.

1292
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,050
You know what's a serious phone for serious gamers?

1293
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,950
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

1294
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:01,990
It's actually...

1295
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:04,810
I'm still, like, blown away that it has 120Hz refresh rate.

1296
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:05,570
Like...

1297
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,750
I didn't realize phones could do that now.

1298
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,670
Like, I didn't realize phones can go above...

1299
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:13,790
Like...

1300
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:14,450
I don't know.

1301
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:15,870
I never thought of it that way.

1302
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:17,830
I never realized, like...

1303
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:18,830
Oh, does that act...

1304
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,270
Wait, better cooling also means battery lasts a lot longer?

1305
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,810
Oh, is that what cooling does?

1306
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,650
The S stands for...

1307
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,550
The S stands for serious.

1308
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,670
Wait, is there GT...

1309
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,110
Is there GT on phone?

1310
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:44,870
Heat pad.

1311
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,170
Oh my gosh, I'm learning so much.

1312
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,430
Like, that's really good.

1313
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:50,250
I always have my...

1314
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:53,510
I always have my phone plugged.

1315
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:57,750
Which is not great.

1316
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:58,990
Also, don't do that.

1317
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,790
Don't always have your phone charged.

1318
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:01,990
Because it actually...

1319
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,450
It actually lessens the battery life on your phone.

1320
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:06,750
You always have it charged.

1321
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,050
Oh, is it Zim?

1322
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,270
I only remember one guy's name on top of my head.

1323
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:25,150
It was like Zim...

1324
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,070
Oh my gosh, and the...

1325
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:32,330
My...

1326
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:32,510
My...

1327
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:32,850
My...

1328
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:33,430
Something, something...

1329
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,350
His name is the easiest.

1330
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:38,850
Oh, it's Zim, Jez, Space, and Marshy.

1331
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:39,770
There you go.

1332
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:42,670
Thank you to the person that did !practice.

1333
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:43,770
I really appreciate it.

1334
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:44,990
Friendly

1335
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,810
Italian restaurant with outdoor seating nearby.

1336
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:54,170
And texted to Luca.

1337
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:57,570
Oh, is this the phone?

1338
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:08,330
I can never bring dad to a restaurant.

1339
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,910
Because he's too much of a nuisance.

1340
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:12,690
He's like...

1341
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:14,590
Yeah, he's too food hungry, man.

1342
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:20,090
I can...

1343
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:21,090
He's too silly.

1344
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,350
He's just a silly little guy.

1345
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,200
Yeah, but yeah, that was draft day.

1346
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,140
That was...

1347
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,940
That was like included in the...

1348
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,400
That was included in the...

1349
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,540
Guys, guys, I have...

1350
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,220
I have turbo, guys.

1351
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,860
I like how you're...

1352
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,100
Okay, what's funny?

1353
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:56,800
It was that...

1354
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,380
What was funny was that...

1355
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,780
My manager thought that was an ad from like Twitch.

1356
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:13,420
But it was literally just like on the channel.

1357
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,620
Because he was messaging, he was like, skip ad.

1358
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,400
I was like, what?

1359
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:21,880
I have turbo.

1360
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,440
I didn't see...

1361
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,120
I didn't see the ad.

1362
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,780
But yeah, that was interesting.

1363
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,500
Um, huge thank you to...

1364
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,560
Um, Samson.

1365
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,180
Um...

1366
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,840
Samson for uh...

1367
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,620
Inviting me and checking out the...

1368
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,080
And checking out the uh...

1369
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:47,960
Draft day for it.

1370
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,720
But this is just like the beginning of the stream.

1371
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,740
The beginning of the whole event.

1372
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,680
Obviously, it was just them getting to know the players.

1373
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,740
And getting to know like...

1374
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,860
Oh my god, I can knock knock.

1375
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,600
You want to do a collab right now, Samson US?

1376
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,820
Knock knock!

1377
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,960
I know your stream is ending, but you want to...

1378
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,180
It's like, knock knock!

1379
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,540
You want to do a collab right now?

1380
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:24,800
Um...

1381
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:26,520
Um...

1382
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,720
But yeah, it actually is...

1383
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,900
It was pretty interesting just to see like how...

1384
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,500
How everything was going to be set up.

1385
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,620
And what the format is.

1386
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,200
And just getting to know the teams in general.

1387
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,980
And getting to see like...

1388
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,340
What the format's going to be.

1389
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,540
I think it'll be very interesting to see how they're going to train the players.

1390
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,240
And the non-mobile players.

1391
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:45,960
And it become...

1392
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,500
Into being like, you know, really good...

1393
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:48,920
Really...

1394
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,320
Really good mobile gamers.

1395
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,120
Like I was...

1396
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:51,980
Oh yeah, I was going to say.

1397
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,020
It's easier to train someone with zero knowledge...

1398
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,320
Going in than it is with someone that's been a part of the...

1399
01:13:59,320 --> 01:13:59,420
Mobile...

1400
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,100
Like...

1401
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,660
I think it's been part of the...

1402
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,220
Part of the scene.

1403
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,260
Because like...

1404
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:08,160
They don't have knowledge from before.

1405
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,560
That's hindering them.

1406
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:10,580
So like...

1407
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,160
So they're like...

1408
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:11,800
Oh, but like...

1409
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,640
Oh, I used to do this and this before.

1410
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,460
But you're like...

1411
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,800
Oh, well, it's different.

1412
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,660
Because this is different.

1413
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,700
This is a different game.

1414
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,100
This is a different mechanics and everything.

1415
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,460
So it will be interesting.

1416
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,080
Because a lot of these players are coming in with like...

1417
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,420
Maybe they never tried Call of Duty mobile before.

1418
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,940
Maybe this is their first time on mobile gaming.

1419
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:33,420
So it's going to be interesting to see how they progress from there.

1420
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,740
And if they become like, you know, insane gamers in general.

1421
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,540
And they're all going to be playing on the same phone.

1422
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,980
So they're all going to be playing on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

1423
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:45,360
So because they're all playing on the same phone.

1424
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,960
Then there's no actual...

1425
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:53,960
It's all going to be the same devices and everything.

1426
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,100
So they're all going to be equally the same in terms of technical side.

1427
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,120
Yeah, the same platform and everything.

1428
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,860
But yeah, I think...

1429
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:09,460
Honestly, I'm just stuck on the fact that it has 120Hz refresh rate.

1430
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,240
I think that's the most interesting part regarding...

1431
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,100
Like, I used to game on 90Hz.

1432
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,820
So it's like, oh my god, I could have done this all on phone.

1433
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,780
But yeah, the Grand Finals are in Las Vegas.

1434
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:27,620
Which is cool.

1435
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,200
Las Vegas is expensive.

1436
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,200
They get to...

1437
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,960
If you win, you get to party in Las Vegas.

1438
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,640
If you lose, you get to party in Las Vegas.

1439
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,300
Like, it's a win-win.

1440
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,180
It's a win-win, guys.

1441
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:53,920
Winning or losing, what happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas.

1442
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,780
But yeah, huge thank you to Samsung.

1443
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,880
And I hope...

1444
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,880
I hope to see, like, what...

1445
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,060
I hope to see, like, which team's gonna be on top.

1446
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,920
I hope Zim's team is actually a performer.

1447
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,440
It'd be very sad if, like, you know...

1448
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,300
Zim did so much research in general.

1449
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,400
He did so much research and then, like, you know...

1450
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,300
Fall flat in the end.

1451
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,440
Because this guy actually, like, looked up the players.

1452
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,520
Right there, right there.

1453
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,400
Watched the...

1454
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,060
Watched players' streams.

1455
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:38,540
And, like, read what their, like, strong points are.

1456
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,220
So, like, I hope that...

1457
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,260
Because he's apparently the weakest mobile pro player.

1458
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:46,820
So, like, as a coach, he should be able to train everybody.

1459
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,580
Yeah, imagine losing to Vybz.

1460
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,540
I would be sad if I...

1461
01:16:53,680 --> 01:17:01,280
If I was a coach and, like, I lost to a guy who just picked based off, like, Vybz off of...

1462
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,160
No, okay.

1463
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,380
That guy picked players based off of photos.

1464
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,580
I thought that was...

1465
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,820
I thought that was so funny.

1466
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:17,140
He was like, bro, look at this guy's photo.

1467
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,420
And I was like, what do you mean look at this guy's photo?

1468
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:22,540
Wait, wait.

1469
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,760
Actually, let's see.

1470
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,200
I want to look at the 1v1 again.

1471
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,210
I want to look at the...

1472
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,040
Okay, let's see the 1v1.

1473
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:28,940
I'm curious.

1474
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:31,440
All right.

1475
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,440
Because the 1v1s were like...

1476
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,140
I didn't realize that it was...

1477
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,220
Okay, I want to see the 1v1s again.

1478
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,580
I'm gonna re-watch the 1v1s real quick.

1479
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,120
There we go.

1480
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,160
The photos look promising.

1481
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,140
Okay, so these were the pros.

1482
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,680
Oh my god.

1483
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,060
Like...

1484
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,380
Like, oh my god.

1485
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,180
That's so fast.

1486
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,780
Like, that movement?

1487
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,140
Like, I'm just...

1488
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,000
Headshot?

1489
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:13,460
Okay.

1490
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,100
Yeah, I was so surprised.

1491
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,580
Oh my god, look at him just running around.

1492
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,320
He's like, get out of here.

1493
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,540
Get out of here.

1494
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,500
Like, I'm just looking at the buttons he's pressing in general too.

1495
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,480
Is it like...

1496
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,680
Okay, it's 1v1.

1497
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:42,100
Oh, are they wearing the...

1498
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,640
The finger...

1499
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,040
The little finger gloves?

1500
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,840
So you know how like on PC, people sometimes wear like those arm sleeves and stuff?

1501
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:53,080
For mobile gaming, it's like those little finger gloves.

1502
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,840
And you were just using that just to fly around this map.

1503
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,780
Maybe hoping to catch a timing on somebody like this player on the outside.

1504
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,820
You know, if you've ever played pubs for roster.

1505
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:09,840
If you've ever, you know, actually 1v1 somebody on this map.

1506
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:11,540
Jesus, it's so fast.

1507
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,700
It's so fast.

1508
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:15,620
Oh my god.

1509
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,640
Oh my god, look at that guy's move.

1510
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,400
Movement's not gonna save you.

1511
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,220
Wait, is this the gun sound?

1512
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,040
Oh my god, I would be so annoyed.

1513
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,500
Like, I don't know how you...

1514
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,940
Okay, the gun looks really cool and the depth animation is really cool.

1515
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,280
But it's like...

1516
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:42,760
Peep, peep, peep, peep!

1517
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,940
Like, I won't be able to take that serious.

1518
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,580
Omni movement can't help you on mobile.

1519
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,240
Omni movement is not gonna help you on mobile.

1520
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:49,380
Omni movement is not gonna help you on mobile.

1521
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,260
That guy's like...

1522
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,220
Oh,

1523
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,080
they put all four of the players in rust.

1524
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,640
Okay, I thought it was like individual 1v1.

1525
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,280
That's... it was literally...

1526
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,100
It was one round.

1527
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,060
It was one round because it was whoever...

1528
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,820
It's like whoever has like...

1529
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,380
Whoever makes it to 21st.

1530
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,000
That's why.

1531
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,460
Okay, that makes more sense now.

1532
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,500
Nearly just one guy like killed everybody.

1533
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:20,660
Yeah.

1534
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,400
It is actually like...

1535
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,200
That's why.

1536
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:32,620
I like the three half comes to end and the one guy with the basic loadout.

1537
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,700
Okay, that's aura.

1538
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,000
That's me like me.

1539
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,540
I was like, I don't need cosmetics to kill you.

1540
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:40,420
Like...

1541
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:41,460
That's...

1542
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:41,960
That... okay.

1543
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:42,640
I like...

1544
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,600
It's really funny because people who do that...

1545
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,340
Like, they don't use...

1546
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,800
They use... they're like default Andes.

1547
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,560
People who do that, it's more so of like...

1548
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,200
It's like...

1549
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,200
They think you're a hacker.

1550
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,700
It's more funny that way.

1551
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,900
They actually think you're a hacker if you don't use like any skins.

1552
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,020
They're like...

1553
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,060
Yeah.

1554
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,980
I think that's...

1555
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:12,700
He's definitely...

1556
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,020
He's aura farming right there.

1557
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,100
Oh wait, he's fourth place.

1558
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:15,720
Never...

1559
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,100
Never mind.

1560
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,720
He farmed too hard.

1561
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,820
Never mind.

1562
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,300
He might have farmed too hard.

1563
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,120
He's negative aura farming.

1564
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,160
He was the...

1565
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,460
I didn't realize he was the coach, guys.

1566
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,660
Okay, which one was the...

1567
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,580
Okay, I wonder...

1568
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:40,930
I think it was the one with the...

1569
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,920
The crystal one.

1570
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,720
Oh, that's cool.

1571
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,500
That's a good reload.

1572
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,420
One of the things I love about Call of Duty Mobile here, Colin...

1573
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,320
It's too much aura.

1574
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,100
Not enough points.

1575
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,720
...who loves my gun looking cool.

1576
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:57,800
And every time I'm able to cast or watch Call of Duty Mobile...

1577
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,000
Ugh.

1578
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,420
I just get a little jealous.

1579
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:00,460
I'm like these...

1580
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,440
Everything looks so crazy.

1581
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:01,960
I don't even know what...

1582
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,980
I want to know who's first.

1583
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,100
Are they the crystal?

1584
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,360
Oh no, it's this guy.

1585
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,640
This guy.

1586
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,660
The one with the hardcore gun.

1587
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,360
Oh my...

1588
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:11,740
Jesus.

1589
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,180
Oh my god.

1590
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,200
Wait, he has like...

1591
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,720
A little whip.

1592
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,240
Oh, is he the number one seed?

1593
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,060
He's one point.

1594
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,760
Not one tap, bro!

1595
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,640
Oh, he was the six-figure.

1596
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,140
The six-figure claw player.

1597
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,400
That was like...

1598
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,760
Jeez, that's...

1599
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:41,540
Okay.

1600
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,260
My god, third...

1601
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,180
Okay, so...

1602
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,340
Let's see.

1603
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
It's three...

1604
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:48,880
Oh my god.

1605
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,180
That guy like actually farmed.

1606
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:50,820
That guy...

1607
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,080
Okay, but like how much...

1608
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,000
What was the fourth place?

1609
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:55,980
Wait!

1610
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:56,780
Bro!

1611
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,000
Did they even show the fourth?

1612
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,160
How many kills the fourth place player get?

1613
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,640
Oh, Zim.

1614
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:04,580
Zim.

1615
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,120
Wait, I want to know how many kills Zim got.

1616
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,020
His aim on mobile is actually crazy.

1617
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:19,720
One more kill.

1618
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,920
Is it actually a one tap?

1619
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,620
Who did he kill?

1620
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,100
Oh, Vitality.

1621
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,720
Okay, is that a second place player?

1622
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:30,580
Oh, wait.

1623
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:31,760
Who did he kill?

1624
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:33,860
Who did he kill?

1625
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,920
Who's Vitality Peanut?

1626
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,260
Is that Zim?

1627
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,020
Wait, was that Zim?

1628
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:42,920
Wait, give me a sec.

1629
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:44,880
I need to...

1630
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,060
Wait, did he kill Zim for the...

1631
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,220
For it?

1632
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,640
Oh, yeah, he did.

1633
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:56,860
That's unfortunate.

1634
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,200
That's unfortunate, guys.

1635
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,480
Oh, man.

1636
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,280
Oh, buddy.

1637
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,740
Okay, don't worry.

1638
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:09,340
Don't worry.

1639
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,400
He can coach the rest.

1640
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,720
I think it is scary because I think like...

1641
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,800
Space is playing in more so of like...

1642
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,000
More so like...

1643
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,700
But then his KDA is not...

1644
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,320
Space is more so like...

1645
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,580
I'm gonna kill as many as I can as fast as I can.

1646
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,380
And...

1647
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:29,000
And it's working for him.

1648
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,060
So it makes more sense.

1649
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,340
His gun is a marksman rifle as well?

1650
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,140
Is that like...

1651
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,860
That's like a 30-30, right?

1652
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,720
Nice shot up towards the top.

1653
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,040
One of the things I love about Call of Duty...

1654
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,280
Is that like a 30-30?

1655
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:49,800
I think Call of Duty skins are actually pretty funny and cool.

1656
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,340
There's a lot of really...

1657
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,160
I saw like...

1658
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,660
There's this guy on Twitter that does like...

1659
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,960
Call of Duty reload animations.

1660
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,940
And there's like some really silly ones.

1661
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,700
Because there's like what the rare ones, right?

1662
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,640
Oh, it's more like a G7.

1663
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,080
I mean, it's all about being accurate.

1664
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,500
This guy's like just trying to be as accurate as possible.

1665
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:10,980
So he has the aim for it.

1666
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,760
His aim is crazy though.

1667
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,300
Like it does not...

1668
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,600
Like it's actually so accurate.

1669
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,280
I just want to know like...

1670
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,820
I want to know like how many kills fourth place guy got.

1671
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,700
It's better than...

1672
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,860
I saw like...

1673
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:37,720
There's like rare...

1674
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,880
Was there like rare animations, right?

1675
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,060
For Call of Duty in general.

1676
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:47,700
There's like rare animations and stuff you can get from reload animation.

1677
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:49,960
I think like...

1678
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,540
I think Call of Duty...

1679
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:55,980
I wish like Call of...

1680
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:56,780
Oh my gosh.

1681
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,000
I wish like other games do like the funny stuff that Call of Duty does.

1682
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:00,920
Like...

1683
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,280
Like the realistic collabs and stuff.

1684
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:05,680
Like...

1685
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:06,960
Tie-ins.

1686
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,760
Isn't that...

1687
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,400
It's like...

1688
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,820
Oh, okay.

1689
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,280
I mean there's some like silly ones in Call of Duty too, but...

1690
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,920
I love the collaborations that...

1691
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,580
Collaborations that Call of Duty does.

1692
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,260
Because they're all...

1693
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,820
Like they're all really funny and silly and I like that.

1694
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:32,050
But yeah, that was interesting.

1695
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,910
It was really interesting to see.

1696
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,590
Like getting my glimpse into...

1697
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:41,750
Into like mobile gaming and the mobile esports scene.

1698
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,810
I have watched other mobile gaming before, but I don't...

1699
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,310
I think I've mostly watched like MOBAs and...

1700
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:50,290
MOBAs and...

1701
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,490
Oh my gosh, which one was the other one?

1702
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,110
There's like a really...

1703
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:55,070
I forgot.

1704
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:55,950
I forgot what it's called.

1705
01:26:56,230 --> 01:27:00,670
But like it's one of the famous mobile games that I always see ads for.

1706
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:05,670
Um, but this is the first time I've ever watched Call of Duty mobile gaming.

1707
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:08,910
And just to see like how it goes.

1708
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:11,430
And like the movement is crazy though.

1709
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:12,550
The movement and aim.

1710
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:14,350
And then you have to be very precise too.

1711
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:17,330
Because like, you know, obviously like PC monitors...

1712
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:20,130
Size versus like mobile size is like a lot different.

1713
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:23,650
But it does have like the graphics for it.

1714
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:27,690
Like the cooling and the higher processor graphics and everything really helps out a lot.

1715
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:30,030
Especially if they're all playing on like the Samsung Galaxy.

1716
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:31,650
That's 25 Ultra.

1717
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:38,950
So, um, I assume like the graphics quality is like a lot more precise and sharp too.

1718
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:41,950
And then there's the 120 hertz as well.

1719
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,730
But yeah, it's very interesting to see.

1720
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:45,710
I look forward to checking out the finals later.

1721
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,810
Um, it was a very short stream.

1722
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:49,830
Um, it was just draft day.

1723
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:50,830
I assume the...

1724
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:53,710
I assume the finals is going to be a lot longer.

1725
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,790
Because obviously it's best of five.

1726
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:56,770
It's a competitive sense.

1727
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:58,810
So we're going to see a lot of people competing.

1728
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:00,890
And there's going to be show matches and everything.

1729
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:02,670
Best of five with show matches.

1730
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,110
Not just like a free-for-all.

1731
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:06,530
So I look forward to checking it out on 25th.

1732
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:09,270
And I hope you guys, uh, check it out with me as well.

1733
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,910
Like show up on stream and watch it with me, guys.

1734
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,530
Anyway, I hope you guys had a fun time with me.

1735
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:17,010
I hope you guys do check out, um, the tournament.

1736
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,750
The Gear Up Cup Trap...

1737
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:19,390
Not draft, sorry.

1738
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:22,370
Gear Up Cup Finals on April 25th.

1739
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,710
It doesn't start at 4 p.m.

1740
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,150
It does start at 5 p.m.

1741
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,670
PST on the 25th.

1742
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:28,330
I might stream a little...

1743
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,150
I'll stream a little earlier for it.

1744
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:35,790
Um, I'll stream a little earlier for it, uh, for, uh, the draft.

1745
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:37,830
I was going to be planning on streaming a little bit...

1746
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:39,270
Starting early for this one.

1747
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,670
But like, I was feeling sick.

1748
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:42,890
Ha ha ha ha.

1749
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:44,630
So I couldn't start right away.

1750
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,870
Um, I couldn't start right away.

1751
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,690
Because like, you guys know why I was feeling sick.

1752
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:49,630
So...

1753
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:50,810
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1754
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:55,630
And I also had to walk my dog too right before.

1755
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:57,650
Oh my gosh, my dog was like...

1756
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,810
My dog was so...

1757
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,910
Okay, dad was so rude today.

1758
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,910
He was...

1759
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:04,210
During his walkies, I was supposed to like...

1760
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,630
I was supposed to...

1761
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:06,170
The moon.

1762
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:07,730
I was supposed to like...

1763
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:10,050
Come back earlier to my PC.

1764
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,170
But then he decided to...

1765
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:13,970
He decided to be like, you know what?

1766
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:15,750
I'm gonna do my business twice.

1767
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:18,490
And I'm gonna make you walk back to the trash can.

1768
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:19,370
I...

1769
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:20,810
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1770
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:24,410
I was like, please!

1771
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:25,930
I have to go back to my PC!

1772
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:27,930
I need to stream!

1773
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,890
I have...

1774
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:32,110
I have to stream!

1775
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:34,690
It's like, nope.

1776
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:38,830
And then he like, walks further away from the trash can too.

1777
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:41,930
He's like, we're about to cross the road to back home.

1778
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:43,930
And then he's like, you know what?

1779
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:45,650
I'm gonna...

1780
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:46,610
I'm gonna...

1781
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:47,610
I'm gonna poop here.

1782
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:50,770
So then I have to walk all the way back to the trash can.

1783
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:55,370
Which is like, you know, at the end of the other side of the walkway.

1784
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,190
At the sidewalk.

1785
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:58,210
I have to walk the other side to the end there.

1786
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,450
And I'm like, please!

1787
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:02,930
And then there was like, six dogs outside too!

1788
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,890
And he hated all of them.

1789
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:05,470
He...

1790
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:08,090
He...

1791
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:10,750
He hated all the dogs.

1792
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,570
So I had to like, grab him.

1793
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:14,410
I legitimately like, couldn't...

1794
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:18,110
Like, the thing is, the moment he saw them, he freaked out too.

1795
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:18,990
He hates poodles.

1796
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:19,750
I don't know why.

1797
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:21,790
He really, really...

1798
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:24,610
There were like, three poodles being walked during that time.

1799
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:26,130
And he hates them.

1800
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:29,090
Like, he saw one poodle and he was like, no!

1801
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:32,370
He freaked out!

1802
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,910
So then like, and I was like, okay, I'm just gonna drag him away.

1803
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:37,070
And then I had to like, and they're all...

1804
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:38,410
And then I had to pick him up.

1805
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:41,170
Because at that point, like, I couldn't deal with it.

1806
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:42,870
I was being surrounded by other dogs.

1807
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:43,790
No,

1808
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:48,150
they were big poodles!

1809
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:50,210
They were the big fancy poodles!

1810
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:53,270
Where you had to like, get them shaved and trimmed all the time.

1811
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:56,550
And so, he was like, he was so annoyed.

1812
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:58,010
He was like, I hate them.

1813
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:01,530
And then, like, we were surrounded by six other dogs being walked.

1814
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:05,010
So I had to actually pick him up and like, pick him up and bring him home.

1815
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:07,790
Because he wouldn't, he refused to like, move.

1816
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:11,050
Like, he was, he was trying to pull me in all directions.

1817
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:13,810
Trying to like, get, get at one of them.

1818
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:22,310
And then like, even when I picked him up, he was like, he's like, I'm gonna get you!

1819
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,890
I'm gonna get you!

1820
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:33,510
He was just like, he was like, I'm gonna get you!

1821
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:38,590
You think because I'm being, I've got upsies and I'm still not threatening?

1822
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:45,690
So, I had to deal with that so that I couldn't start my stream earlier.

1823
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,910
But yes, for the 25th, I will start my stream earlier.

1824
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:54,310
Just so like, people can like, come in before the actual tournament starts.

1825
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:57,670
And we can have a little chat too, before it starts too.

1826
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:03,450
I hope I, by then I will most likely not be like, feeling sick before the stream.

1827
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:09,190
And having to like, readjust my brain for the stream.

1828
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:12,310
And everything.

1829
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:13,970
But yes, thank you again.

1830
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:18,010
I hope you do check out the phone, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

1831
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:19,410
I hope you do check it out.

1832
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:24,050
It does have, I mean, 6.9 inches is nice up on display.

1833
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:26,970
And the refresh rate and everything.

1834
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:27,910
And also, graphing processor.

1835
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:29,970
But yeah, I hope you guys do check out the phone.

1836
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:33,070
A huge thank you for the support from Samsung.

1837
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:39,530
And for letting me be one of the official co-streams.

1838
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:40,890
Hey guys, I'm gonna head off now.

1839
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:44,530
If I don't raid, you guys can randomly disperse.

1840
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:47,390
I don't know, sometimes I just feel like not raiding.

1841
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:48,010
I don't know.

1842
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:51,570
It's just hard trying to figure out who to raid, okay?

1843
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:53,090
It's just really hard.

1844
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:58,050
I hate making decisions sometimes.

1845
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:03,330
So if there's no raid, just randomly disperse to wherever you want to go to.

1846
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:04,490
I mean, I could raid one of the...

1847
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:06,710
I'll just raid one of the people that's competing.

1848
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:07,410
How about that?

1849
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:07,830
Let's see.

1850
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:09,810
Maybe one of them are still doing the stream.

1851
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:11,570
They'll be like, who the heck is she?

1852
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:14,750
And then I'll be like, hello and peace out.

1853
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:15,590
Maybe, you know what?

1854
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:15,830
Yeah.

1855
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:17,890
Maybe I'll raid one of...

1856
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,210
Wait, do they have...

1857
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,230
Oh, never mind.

1858
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:20,630
Sorry.

1859
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:21,790
Are they all on YouTube?

1860
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:24,530
Wait, are they all...

1861
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:26,190
Okay guys, never mind.

1862
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:28,310
I think they're all gonna be streaming it on...

1863
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:30,110
Are they all streaming on YouTube?

1864
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:32,270
Where's their Twitch?

1865
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:33,870
Okay, let me look.

1866
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:35,910
Guys, let me look real quick to see if they have...

1867
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:40,630
Uh...

1868
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:42,090
Wait, they're all on YouTube.

1869
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:43,990
Are they actually?

1870
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:45,590
Let me check real quick.

1871
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:48,390
Jazz.

1872
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:50,730
I don't know.

1873
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:54,370
I'm looking guys.

1874
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:57,890
Three nukes, back to back to back.

1875
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:00,810
Oh, sorry, that's his...

1876
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:01,390
Twitter.

1877
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:04,670
Wait, are they actually?

1878
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:07,650
Oh, aw I wanted to...

1879
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:11,190
I wanted to like, raid them on Twitch if they're on Twitch.

1880
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:12,690
Aw, okay.

1881
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:13,930
Let's see.

1882
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:15,670
Alright.

1883
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:18,230
Most likely, I'll just be like, disperse.

1884
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:19,490
Find your home.

1885
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,810
I hate choosing.

1886
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:25,550
Find your home.

1887
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:27,290
Find where you wanna live.

1888
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:33,250
Find a... oh, you know what?

1889
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:33,790
I'll raid.

1890
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:34,570
You know what?

1891
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:35,390
I know who to raid.

1892
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:36,670
Alright.

1893
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:39,430
Alright, I know who to raid.

1894
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,310
You don't have to find a home anymore.

1895
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:42,570
I will bring you a home.

1896
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,750
Alright, I'll see you guys later, everybody.

1897
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:44,690
As always, everybody...

1898
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:45,410
Stay hydrated.

1899
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:46,050
Posture check.

1900
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:48,190
Get up a bit more and move around to get that blood flow.

1901
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:49,270
And you stay up for me?

1902
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,890
Head to bed, cause you deserve it.

1903
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:52,210
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1904
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:53,190
Bye, guys.

1905
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,870
Bye!

1906
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:58,010
Also, check me out on YouTube, cause I usually stream more on there.

1907
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:00,210
Sorry, my brain's all foggy right now.

1908
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:02,110
Bye-bye, everybody.

1909
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:02,890
Bye!
