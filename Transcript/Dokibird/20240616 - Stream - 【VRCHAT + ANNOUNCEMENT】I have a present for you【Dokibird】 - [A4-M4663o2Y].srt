00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,610
Hey.

2
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm a bird.

3
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,070
Hey guys.

4
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,530
Yeah, that's right!

5
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,170
I'm a bird now!

6
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,230
Funniest shit ever, guys!

7
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,490
They turned me into a fucking bird!

8
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,390
Don't worry guys.

9
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,330
I also have... I have arms.

10
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,690
I don't know if... Am I okay?

11
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,510
Is that the truth?

12
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,750
Don't... Yeah, that's me!

13
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,870
I'm a bird now!

14
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,010
Did you guys... Could you guys tell from the thumbnail?

15
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,090
That I was gonna be a bird?

16
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,470
Yeah, that's right.

17
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,130
Full body tracking.

18
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,570
Is the sound okay?

19
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,150
I've evolved.

20
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,130
Bro, okay.

21
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,610
Have you ever seen a bird shake its... tail?

22
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,830
Yeah!

23
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,870
I can also do this.

24
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,730
I can extend... extend my neck a little bit.

25
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,350
The sound is okay.

26
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,470
The sound is okay.

27
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,070
Oh, that's great.

28
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,810
That's good to know.

29
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,930
That's all I need to know.

30
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,690
That's all I need to know.

31
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,670
Anyway.

32
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,510
Yeah!

33
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,510
Hey guys!

34
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,830
This is not the announcement, by the way.

35
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,250
Don't... Don't worry.

36
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,370
This is... This is not the announcement, guys.

37
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,570
I need to fix my head... I need to fix my... my... myself a bit more.

38
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,050
Okay, there we go.

39
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,930
There we go.

40
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,630
I think that's better.

41
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:17,970
Alright.

42
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,790
So anyway.

43
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,750
This is not the announcement.

44
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,450
If you guys wanna know what the announcement is, you gotta wait until the very end.

45
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,030
But for now, we gotta enjoy some... some Doki Birds.

46
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,650
Whoa...

47
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,550
That's stupid.

48
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,790
Okay.

49
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,970
So like... I actually have like... I can do different things with it.

50
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,790
So like... hey... I can be... I can be a little happy.

51
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,150
And then... Whoa...

52
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,050
Oh my god!

53
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,370
I'm sad!

54
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,790
And then I can be...

55
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,530
I can be...

56
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,310
I can just be sad.

57
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,450
I bet this is sad.

58
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,270
But I can be sad.

59
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,470
And then I can be like...

60
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,490
Whoa.

61
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,230
Huh?

62
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,370
And then I can change my eye color.

63
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,590
So it's...

64
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,310
Oh wait!

65
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,250
That's the mirror?

66
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,890
Oh my god!

67
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,150
Wait!

68
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,530
That's a mir... Sorry, I didn't know what mirrors are.

69
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,670
After becoming a bird.

70
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,530
I didn't realize that...

71
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,410
That's a mirror?

72
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,510
Oh my god!

73
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,350
That was the fucking mirror!

74
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,190
Where's the camera?

75
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,610
Where...

76
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,150
Wait a minute.

77
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,910
Where's the camera then?

78
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,810
If that's the mir... Okay sorry.

79
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,150
Now I'm facing the camera.

80
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,530
Where the fuck is the camera?

81
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,470
Where...

82
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,410
Sorry.

83
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,810
Sorry.

84
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,450
I didn't realize...

85
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,770
That was the...

86
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,790
That was the mirror.

87
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,790
So... Yeah!

88
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,390
Yeah.

89
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,670
So I have hands actually.

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,510
Okay so this was done by...

91
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm so sorry I forgot the name.

92
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,330
The creator.

93
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,750
I saw them post like...

94
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,090
A crow model.

95
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,610
And I was like... Oh my god.

96
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,470

97
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:20,970
That's so funny.

98
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,810

99
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,630

107
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,110
I don't know where the camera went guys.

108
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,010
Where did the camera go?

109
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,890
I needed it to face me!

110
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,210

111
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,010
I can't find the camera!

112
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,550
Oh no!

113
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,750
I haven't been in VR chat in so long.

114
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:52,970
I don't...

115
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,590
I don't know where...

116
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,590

117
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,690

Okay.

123
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,450

127
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,290
I actually don't know where it went!

128
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,770

Doesn't really have hands.

Yes!

351
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,230

You might recognize those names.

354
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:50,490
I was so happy that Preachy wanted to work with me on the Chibi 3D model.

355
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,990
I always loved her models.

356
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,250

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,430
So...

363
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,270

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,190

00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,310
Okay!

390
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,510
In the future we'll have... You literally met the crow for like... for like 10 minutes!

391
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,870
How do you already fall in love with the bird?

392
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,530
How do you...

393
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,670
What is this fucking Princess and the Frog shit?

394
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,190
How do you fall in love with the bird already?

395
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,150
It's been 10 minutes.

396
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,890
Anyway... Anyway...

397
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,010
Um...

398
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:42,630
But yes, this was like the main reason why I really, really, really wanted to work with Poochie for this model.

399
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,030
I really wanted to have plushies!

400
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:52,610
And I felt like her style was... worked so well in plushie form.

401
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,150
So I was like super excited.

402
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,250
I was like, yes!

403
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,290
Yes!

404
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,410
Yes!

405
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,190
Yes!

406
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:11,870
So... So I'm really happy to be able to work with her and like being able to... You know... I mean look at it.

407
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,350
It's so cool!

408
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,050
It's so cute!

409
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,550
Yeah.

410
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,910
Anyway, it took a while to find a world for this.

411
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,390
So...

412
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,070
I didn't know what world to go to!

413
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,770
I just literally was like...

414
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:31,370
I was looking at Animal Crossing worlds and then... Because we don't have any actual personal 3D world because that's a lot of work.

415
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,450
And I already have like a million other projects ongoing right now.

416
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,150
So like...

417
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,070
A 3D world is sort of like...

418
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,610
You know... Not in the near future... Not in the next coming months guys.

419
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,770
So I had to like borrow some worlds while I was exploring VRChat.

420
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,230
And I was like... Oh my god!

421
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,230
Like I even went to like...

422
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,610
I even looked at like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon worlds and everything.

423
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,330
And then...

424
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,290
The perfect one was literally Minecraft.

425
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,470
Because I needed an open field.

426
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,950
I needed...

427
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,350
I needed a...

428
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,930
I needed like an open field.

429
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,790
And I was like...

430
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,450
Okay... This is... This is an open field.

431
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,670
It's Minecraft.

432
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,350
It's...

433
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,450
It's Minecraft!

434
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,430
It's an open field!

435
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,030
Uh...

436
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,850
But yeah... So that is...

437
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,150
A gift... Wait... Where's my arm?

438
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,250
This is...

439
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,090
Where's my arm?

440
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,790
Is this my arm?

441
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:31,950
Oh!

442
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,470
Okay...

443
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,070
This is gift number one!

444
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,510
Gift number two!

445
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,670
Gift number two...

446
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,450
Is...

447
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,310
Basically...

448
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,390
You see this?

449
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,730
This is gonna be for free.

450
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,670
For all you guys.

451
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,370
You can do anything you want with the 3D model.

452
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,470
So...

453
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,810
Um... It will be uploaded later on Sketchfab.

454
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,090
Um... And you will be able to download it and do whatever the fuck you want.

455
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,330
But like... Like you know...

456
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,930
Not really everything.

457
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,790
You want...

458
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:09,150
I won't be putting the crow though.

459
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,210
The crow is exclusively for me.

460
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,330
So...

461
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,010
Um...

462
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,670
No crows though.

463
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,830
No crows.

464
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,650
But the...

465
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,510
This will be for you guys.

466
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,810
You can do what you want.

467
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,470
Make animation.

468
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,250
Put me in a game that you're making.

469
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,370
Uh...

470
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,570
Mod me into something.

471
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,130
Anything you want to do.

472
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,370
Um... As long as you don't monetize it.

473
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,170
That's all.

474
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,950
That's all I ask for.

475
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,730
As long as you don't make money off of it.

476
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,050
I mean if you were making a video and you're using this.

477
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,490
That's fine.

478
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,190
But as long as you don't make like physical products and like mass produce them.

479
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,210
And make money out of it.

480
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,330
Then no.

481
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,850
Cause I'm gonna do that.

482
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,750
.

483
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,070
You can't do it.

484
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,190
Cause I'm gonna do that.

485
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,850
So you're not allowed to.

486
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,630
.

487
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,930
.

488
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,110
.

489
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,110
No!

490
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:02,930
No crow!

491
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,370
Because the crow.

492
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,490
I didn't ask permission if I could.

493
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,250
Cause like I...

494
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,010
I don't know.

495
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,310
I didn't ask permission if I could put it up for public.

496
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,010
Cause it's like...

497
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,170
It's their crow model.

498
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,190
And I asked them if they could reskin it to me.

499
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,630
And oh my god.

500
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,310
You guys really want...

501
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,690
Okay fine.

502
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,630
I'll be the fucking crow.

503
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,270
.

504
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,550
Alright.

505
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,010
Where am I?

506
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,730
Alright.

507
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,510
There you go.

508
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,030
Are you happy?

509
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,310
Are you... Look.

510
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,690
I'll advertise my plushie as a crow.

511
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,470
So yes!

512
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,270
Um...

513
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,270
.

514
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,410
I'll give... I'll give the dragoons...

515
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,210
What they want.

516
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:41,850
So...

517
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,970
Yes.

518
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,590
Um...

519
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,050
This will be put for pre-orders.

520
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,750
Maybe in... in a month.

521
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,690
Or...

522
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,010
Or two.

523
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:53,970
I don't know.

524
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,650
I'm still...

525
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,550
We're going through pre-production right now.

526
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,450
And it's so hard.

527
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,450
For the plushies.

528
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,210
Cause it's like... They send you...

529
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,110
For anyone that's ever made a plushie before.

530
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,230
The first draft...

531
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,130
Looks fucking ridiculous.

532
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,430
And it looks like really bad.

533
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,610
And you have to go through multiple drafts.

534
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,510
Before it looks good.

535
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,690
So like...

536
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,690
I want to be sure that we have an actual good looking plushie.

537
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,670
Before I put it up for pre-order.

538
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,770
So yes.

539
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,490
You gotta wait a month or maybe two.

540
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,210
I'm not sure.

541
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,330
But I just wanted to show you guys.

542
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,370
Maybe a month.

543
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,510
Maybe a month later.

544
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,870
You might notice the store is...

545
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,470
The store is...

546
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,590
Offline right now.

547
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,210
Cause...

548
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,610
When it's back online.

549
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,130
It's gonna look so cool.

550
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,530
Like it took us a long time.

551
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,930
To like...

552
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,390
Get that store ready.

553
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,090
For you guys.

554
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,370
But there's gonna be like...

555
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,410
New stuff on it.

556
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:48,530
And...

557
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,110
It's gonna look... Or maybe not.

558
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:50,690
Actually no.

559
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,850
I remember one of my staff members were like...

560
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,310
Yeah there's not gonna be... The new products aren't gonna be on it yet.

561
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,730
But yes!

562
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,590
Lots of stuff was being shipped out.

563
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,070
Apparently.

564
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,450
My distributor told me that...

565
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,190
Like...

566
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,490
They shipped out like...

567
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,730
2000 plus products already.

568
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,230
In like... Within a week.

569
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,130
So that was fucking crazy.

570
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,270
I was like holy shit.

571
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,010
I can... I can actually like...

572
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,910
Umm...

573
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,090
I can actually like work on new stuff now.

574
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:16,670
Like this.

575
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,410

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,480
Another time.

770
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,880
Because.

771
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,300
Because I don't know how to do it.

772
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,920
I don't.

773
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,520
I don't know.

774
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,020
We'll figure it out.

775
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Entity are you watching?

776
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:29,720

Just finished testing it.

789
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,360
Um.

792
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,580

794
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,100
I was trying to find worlds to go to.

795
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm sorry.

796
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,660
I lied.

797
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,260
I thought it was fixed.

798
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,280
I didn't think you.

799
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,660

I didn't think.

802
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,480
I didn't think that like.

803
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,980
I can open the box.

804
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,720
It's a box.

805
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,680
What do you mean?

806
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,260
I can't open the box.

She says that she naturally lied.

815
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,620
But for real this time.

816
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,080

So anyway.

820
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,260
I guess we could explore.

821
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,680
Um.

822
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000

823
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,200
Like this entire stream was just me.

824
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,700

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,500
All the bad guys.

834
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,260
The bad guys.

835
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,720

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
Or like the saiyan squad.

837
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,800

I'm so sorry.

844
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,860
A lot of Dragon Ball Z fans are going to send me hate mail now.

That's not a green screen.

00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
There's like a square.

00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,860
A grey square.

Let's see.

1236
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,550
Where's my camera?

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,050
Oh my god.

Okay.

1246
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,600
All I'm saying is if you see a fucking bird.

1247
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,760
That's sitting like this.

1248
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,080
The bird has issues.

1249
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,740
Like it's actually not good.

1250
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,960
A bird should not be sitting down.

1251
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,920
Hahahaha.

1252
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,420
Hahahaha.

1253
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,080
Hahahaha.

1254
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,560
Hahahaha.

1255
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,120
If you see a wild bird that's sitting like this.

1256
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
Please call a veterinarian.

1257
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,160
Or I don't know.

1258
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,620
Do something.

1259
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,800
A bird should not be sitting down.

1260
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,920
It's not natural.

1261
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,060
But.

1262
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,900
Oh my god.

1263
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,000

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,520
Okay.

1267
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,840
I look so fucking stupid.

1268
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,500
But like.

1269
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,520

00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,840
Hahahaha.

00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,360
Go back to.

Hahahaha.

1290
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,260
The tracking is actually.

1297
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,000

You guys don't want the bird back.

1300
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Stop lying.

1301
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,240
Stop lying to yourselves.

1302
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,540

1303
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,320
Stop lying to yourselves.

I know you guys don't actually want the bird back.

1305
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,440

1306
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,180

But yes.

I have full body tracking right now.

1313
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,420
Um.

1314
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,640
I'm sitting down because I want to know what it looks like when I'm sitting down.

1315
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,740
And I guess like.

Guys.

1322
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,260
I can touch my toes.

1323
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,480
Look.

1324
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,100
It's not my fault.

1325
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,880
My arms are short.

1326
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,680

It's not my fault.

1330
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,160
My arms are short.

That's really it.

I just really wanted to do.

1346
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,740
Uh.

1347
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,220
I just really wanted to do this stream.

1348
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,500
For the sake of showing you guys this.

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,560
You know what.

1352
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:11,780
No.

1353
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,600
Let's visit one world.

1354
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,240
We'll visit one world guys.

1355
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,400

1356
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:15,780
Wait.

1357
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,080
Okay.

1358
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,580
Wait.

1359
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,360
Was Entity in chat?

1360
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,600
Sorry Entity.

1361
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,680
I don't know what you said.

1362
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:19,980
Guys.

1363
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,000
Parry what Entity said to us.

1364
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,060
In chat.

1365
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,180
What did Entity say?

1366
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,960
What's the announcement?

1367
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,520
No.

1368
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:29,960
That's what I'm saying.

1369
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,320
I'll do like.

1370
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,920
Maybe I'll go visit one world.

1371
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,560
And then.

1372
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:32,980
Uh.

1373
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,560
And then.

1374
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,220
Um.

1375
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,440
And then.

1376
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:36,580
Oh.

1377
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:36,980
Okay.

1378
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,380
Okay.

1379
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:37,980
Wait.

1380
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,440
Do I have to restart?

1381
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,600
Entity.

1382
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,260
Do I have to restart?

1383
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,540
Hahahaha.

1384
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:44,920
Hahahaha.

1385
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,460
Do I.

1386
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,780
Do I have to.

1387
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,120
Oh wait.

1388
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,520
I can take.

1389
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:47,980
I forgot.

1390
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:48,940
Guys.

1391
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,260
There was one thing.

1392
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,720
I can be bald.

1393
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,320
Oh my god.

1394
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:52,980
I look so wrong.

1395
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,160
I look so fucking wrong.

1396
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,360
Hahahaha.

1397
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,660
Hahahaha.

1398
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:00,860
Hahahaha.

1399
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,120
Yes.

1400
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,340
I can take off my hat.

1401
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,160
But I don't.

1402
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,800
I don't like that.

1403
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,600
I look like some fucking generic anime girl now.

1404
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,860
With all my hat.

1405
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,160
Chat.

1406
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,640
To be fair.

1407
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,900
I actually look.

1408
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,000
I look like.

1409
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,440
I look so generic with all my hat.

1410
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,680
The hat is what makes me special.

1411
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,320
Um.

1412
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,680
Anyway.

1413
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,080
Okay.

1414
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,880
Let's get back up.

1415
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,640
I just want to know what.

1416
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,660
It looks like when I.

1417
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,400
Ugh.

1418
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,720
When I sit down.

1419
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,420
Um.

1420
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,120
But yes.

1421
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,480
Let's see.

1422
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,460
Let us.

1423
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,840
See if it's fixed now.

1424
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,080
Do I have to restart?

1425
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,060
I don't know.

1426
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,720
We'll find out.

1427
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,420
I don't have to restart.

1428
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:39,740
Okay.

1429
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,460
Okay guys.

1430
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:40,780
I'm gonna.

1431
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,640
Wait.

1432
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,200
Oh god.

1433
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,520
Okay.

1434
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,400
Look at me.

1435
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,380
Auto level.

1436
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:47,860
Okay.

1437
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,460
Nice.

1438
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,020
And then auto level.

1439
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,080
But where am I?

1440
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,100
Where?

1441
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,660
Oh no.

1442
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,580
I'm too big now.

1443
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,300
Okay.

1444
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,080
Auto level.

1445
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,480
Okay.

1446
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:56,980
There we go.

1447
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,840
And then I'll be here.

1448
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,580
Okay guys.

1449
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,320
We're gonna do a demonstration.

1450
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,100
Of the announcement.

1451
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,220
Slash gift.

1452
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,420
We're gonna practice a little bit.

1453
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:06,760
Okay.

1454
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,760
Here it is.

1455
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,160
Here.

1456
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,860
I can see it now.

1457
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,560
But.

1458
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,480
Ugh.

1459
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:17,820
Okay.

1460
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,280
Guys give me a sec.

1461
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,620
We're gonna.

1462
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,580
We're gonna figure this out.

1463
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,520
Okay.

1464
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,400
Please.

1465
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,600
Please.

1466
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Why is this so difficult?

1467
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,200
Entity I'm sorry.

1468
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,680
This is what I mean when I said I'm so bad at gestures.

1469
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,300
Okay.

1470
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,070
We're gonna figure this out.

1471
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,030
Guys.

1472
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,170
Okay.

1473
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:51,450
We're gonna figure this out.

1474
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:51,790
Guys.

1475
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,010
Guys.

1476
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,550
We're gonna.

1477
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:55,410
Okay.

1478
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,390
The first step.

1479
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,050
The moment I figure this out.

1480
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,830
We can go to the world and I can give you your announcement.

1481
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:01,790
Okay.

1482
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,890
Firmly grasp it.

1483
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,170
I'm firmly grasping it.

1484
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,870
I'm.

1485
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:10,250
Okay.

1486
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,110
Alright.

1487
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,650
This is.

1488
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,970
He said rock and roll.

1489
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:15,450
Oh.

1490
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:17,910
I did it.

1491
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:18,090
Wait.

1492
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:18,650
Where's the camera?

1493
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,250
Camera is.

1494
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:21,850
Okay.

1495
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,250
Camera is somewhere here.

1496
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,590
Because that's where I'm looking at.

1497
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,310
Where did the camera go?

1498
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,090
Where.

1499
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,830
Where are you?

1500
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:33,590
You're.

1501
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,550
You're here somewhere.

1502
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:35,550
You're here.

1503
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,810
You're in front of me.

1504
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:37,930
Oh.

1505
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,570
There you are.

1506
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,230
There you are.

1507
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:39,490
Okay.

1508
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:41,870
Alright.

1509
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,890
That's what we're trying to do.

1510
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,290
Okay.

1511
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,150
And then.

1512
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:48,810
Wait.

1513
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,090
This is the wrong arm.

1514
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:50,510
I'm going to go for this.

1515
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,430
Oh my god.

1516
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,650
Oh my god.

1517
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:57,930
Oh my god.

1518
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,550
What's this POV?

1519
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,570
Doki eats you.

1520
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,370
Oh my god.

1521
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:07,870
Guys.

1522
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:08,650
I'm practicing.

1523
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,550
I'm practicing right now.

1524
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:10,890
Okay.

1525
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,530
Okay.

1526
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:12,330
Guys.

1527
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,210
I figured it out.

1528
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,330
I figured it out this time.

1529
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,810
I did it.

1530
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,890
Are you proud of me?

1531
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:20,390
I'm sorry.

1532
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:22,030
Okay.

1533
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,390
Let's go to.

1534
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,270
Let's go to a.

1535
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,290
Oh.

1536
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,850
This would be the perfect place.

1537
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,310
I want to go here.

1538
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,950
No.

1539
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,930
This is a random world.

1540
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,770
This is a public world.

1541
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:36,330
No.

1542
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:37,630
No.

1543
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,590
No children please.

1544
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,110
No children.

1545
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,350
That's all I ask.

1546
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,170
Oh god.

1547
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:43,590
Okay.

1548
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:44,590
Worlds.

1549
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,690
I've been getting a lot of messages.

1550
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,210
I think on Discord.

1551
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:48,790
But like.

1552
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,670
I don't know.

1553
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,050
Oh no.

1554
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:52,710
Where am I?

1555
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,090
Okay.

1556
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:54,870
New instance.

1557
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:56,370
Invite.

1558
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:56,690
Okay.

1559
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:56,990
There we go.

1560
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:57,650
Thank god.

1561
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,610
I was freaking out there.

1562
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,130
I thought I was going to get children again.

1563
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,430
So.

1564
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,750
Good thing.

1565
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,910
Good thing it's not kids.

1566
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,570
Good thing.

1567
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:14,490
Uh.

1568
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,650
Not children.

1569
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:18,250
Okay.

1570
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,670
Let's go back to.

1571
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,150
Small.

1572
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:24,330
Um.

1573
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,630
Where's my camera?

1574
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,990
This is like my entire world.

1575
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:28,430
Just.

1576
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,190
Where's my camera?

1577
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,070
Dude.

1578
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,510
Where's my car?

1579
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,050
Alright.

1580
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:32,850
Camera?

1581
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:34,770
Oh there you are.

1582
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,350
Guys.

1583
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,870
I think this is a good spot.

1584
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,170
To.

1585
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:40,950
You know.

1586
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,610
To like.

1587
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,630
Have.

1588
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,290
Look!

1589
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,190
Isn't this a great spot?

1590
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,790
To see your gift?

1591
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,590
It's like.

1592
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,490
It's the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon world.

1593
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,110
Where you like.

1594
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,270
Almost died.

1595
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,270
And get reincarnated as a Pokemon.

1596
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:58,430
Look!

1597
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,950
Isn't it so cute?

1598
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,470
I love.

1599
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,850
I love Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1600
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,730
It's one of my.

1601
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:04,610
Uh.

1602
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,130
Favorite.

1603
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,450
It's literally one of my favorite Pokemon series.

1604
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,290
Despite all the shit I say about Pokemon.

1605
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:10,510
Um.

1606
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,010
New version.

1607
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,830
New version Pokemon.

1608
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,610
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1609
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,210
On the DS.

1610
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:17,350
That shit was fire.

1611
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,250
Uh.

1612
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,510
That was peak.

1613
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,950
Peak Pokemon for me.

1614
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:23,810
And.

1615
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,110
That and Crystal.

1616
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,010
Pokemon Crystal.

1617
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,590
And Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1618
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,270
Peak.

1619
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,750
Um.

1620
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,310
Peak Pokemon for me.

1621
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,190
Um.

1622
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,950
We don't talk about the newer Pokemon games.

1623
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,230
I'm sorry if you guys actually like the newer Pokemon games.

1624
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:36,670
But.

1625
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,470
Um.

1626
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,150
Yeah.

1627
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:40,490
Okay.

1628
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:41,710
Alright guys.

1629
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:42,730
So.

1630
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,090
Um.

1631
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:44,950
I know I said.

1632
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:45,390
Like.

1633
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,510
We're visiting VR Chat Worlds.

1634
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,070
Yay!

1635
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,550
But that was sort of like a clickbait type thing.

1636
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,470
Well I mean.

1637
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,410
We visited this world.

1638
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,450
We visited three worlds.

1639
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:52,950
Technically.

1640
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,830
So like.

1641
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:54,530
I did my thing.

1642
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:54,990
I.

1643
00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:01,350
I didn't clickbait.

1644
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,910
Because I did say.

1645
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,070
We're visiting VR Chat Worlds.

1646
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,770
And that was three worlds.

1647
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,930
And mostly.

1648
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,190
I just wanted to like.

1649
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,290
Show you guys this.

1650
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:09,950
Whoa.

1651
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:11,350
Yeah.

1652
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,070
And then that's me teabagging you.

1653
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,090
Um.

1654
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,430
Oh that should have been a green screen.

1655
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:17,990
Fuck.

1656
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,490
God damn it.

1657
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,890
That should have been a fucking green screen.

1658
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:25,370
Alright.

1659
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,050
Um.

1660
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:26,750
Video editors.

1661
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,670
You can crop out all that background.

1662
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,590
You know.

1663
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,730
And then.

1664
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,690
I wanted to showcase this for you guys.

1665
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,250
Because.

1666
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:37,970
I mean.

1667
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:38,670
I mean come on.

1668
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:39,590
I look fucking cute.

1669
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,070
And also.

1670
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,270
Your new favorite.

1671
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,290
Oshii.

1672
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:47,430
Crowbird.

1673
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:47,790
Like.

1674
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:48,530
I don't know.

1675
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:49,850
Crowbird?

1676
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:50,430
Doki Crow?

1677
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:51,970
Crowdokia?

1678
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,570
I don't know.

1679
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,330
I don't know what sounds good.

1680
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,230
Um.

1681
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,370
I mean you could just literally be like.

1682
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:55,830
Doki bird.

1683
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:56,650
Because it's literally a bird.

1684
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,090
Oh my gosh.

1685
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:57,530
My legs.

1686
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,190
My fucking legs.

1687
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,990
Um.

1688
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:02,330
What was I gonna say?

1689
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:02,770
Oh yeah.

1690
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,130
Yeah.

1691
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,030
It's gift time.

1692
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,550
Oh.

1693
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:05,850
It's gift time.

1694
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:07,250
Oh.

1695
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:07,590
It's on B.

1696
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:07,990
Sorry.

1697
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,750
I was like.

1698
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,830
Where is it?

1699
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,170
Where's the gift?

1700
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:14,970
Oh my god.

1701
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,770
I'm gonna eat the sun!

1702
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,670
Oh my god.

1703
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,710
You can't come out of the ocean.

1704
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:26,590
Like Godzilla.

1705
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:29,630
Okay.

1706
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:33,250
Okay.

1707
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,120
Um.

1708
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,040
Where is.

1709
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:40,380
Alright.

1710
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,300
Alright.

1711
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,460
It's gift time.

1712
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,380
Wait.

1713
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,640
The camera's so tiny now.

1714
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,340
No.

1715
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,280
The camera's not here.

1716
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,020
VRChat please.

1717
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,840
Can you make the camera more noticeable?

1718
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,280
I don't ask for much.

1719
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,440
I just wanna know where the fuck the camera is.

1720
00:48:59,300 --> 00:48:59,820
VRChat.

1721
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,280
This is all I ask.

1722
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Where's the camera?

1723
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,640
Okay.

1724
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,680
You're.

1725
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,220
You're here.

1726
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,380
Which means.

1727
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,080
You're below me.

1728
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,000
Which means you're somewhere here.

1729
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,300
But like where?

1730
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,780
I'm not blind!

1731
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,180
It's literally so hard to see!

1732
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,400
It's different!

1733
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,200
It's different!

1734
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,260
Okay.

1735
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,320

I can't end it until I find the camera.

1744

Where could you be?

1745

1927
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,460
It's not in my stomach.

1928
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,620
It's like in my head.

1929
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:44,940
Okay?

1930
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,440
Because the true form.

1931
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,860
Is inside of me.

1932
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,260
In here.

1933
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,060
In the head.

1934
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:53,920
Right here.

1935
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,500
So yes.

1936
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,260
Retro doki might not make much of an appearance.

1937
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,760
After the 22nd.

1938
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,600
Any future merch.

1939
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,220
Unless we're doing like.

1940
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,200
Retro stuff.

1941
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:09,900
Like you know the.

1942
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Altagirl doki.

1943
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,340
And all that stuff.

1944
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,460
And like have like.

1945
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,240
Stands of that.

1946
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,980
And stuff like that.

1947
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,560
Like chibi stuff.

1948
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,400
For all my past iterations.

1949
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:22,980
As doki.

1950
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,700
And all my outfits as doki.

1951
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,920
We're still gonna do that stuff.

1952
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,820
But moving forward.

1953
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,640
For like sponsors.

1954
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,020
Brand deals.

1955
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,200
Future streams.

1956
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,980
Future identity.

1957
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,280
Will be new skin suit.

1958
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,520
So look forward to the new.

1959
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,260
I was so nervous.

1960
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,800
About my new skin suit.

1961
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,900
Because I don't know.

1962
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,140
It's different.

1963
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,080
You saw the silhouette.

1964
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,360
It is different.

1965
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,320
So I hope you guys.

1966
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,660
It's like a combination.

1967
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,160
Of past, present and future.

1968
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,200
So like I grew up.

1969
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
I feel like I grew a lot.

1970
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,720
As a content creator.

1971
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,380
Over the years.

1972
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,420
I might not feel like I'm.

1973
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,600
Like this.

1974
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,840
As much as I used to in the past.

1975
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:15,720
You know.

1976
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,200
It is a pretty old skin suit.

1977
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,760
It is a pretty old skin suit.

1978
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,580
So like.

1979
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,360
It was time for an upgrade.

1980
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,360
Design wise.

1981
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,840
And like personality.

1982
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,660
Like how I feel on the outside.

1983
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,740
To match more.

1984
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,000
Of how I feel on the inside.

1985
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,760
So that's why.

1986
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,660
I do hope you guys like it.

1987
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,200
We went through so many.

1988
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,860
Me and my new mama.

1989
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,200
Went through so many drafts.

1990
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,660
And then I got my old mama.

1991
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,820
To help me as well.

1992
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,140
To figure out what exactly I wanted.

1993
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,540
And uh.

1994
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,480
But yeah.

1995
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:57,780
Yeah.

1996
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:58,760
Yeehaw.

1997
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,920
All I'm saying.

1998
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,280
Is that you might be like.

1999
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,520
Wow Dokie.

2000
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,200
I'm putting in a new Fallout show.

2001
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,020
With the ghoul.

2002
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,280
No!

2003
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,500
It was not because of the ghoul.

2004
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,360
I had that idea.

2005
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,680
Before the ghoul was a thing.

2006
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,240
So I need to tell you guys right now.

2007
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,580
I did not got inspired by the ghoul.

2008
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,820
I had the idea.

2009
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,600
My mama.

2010
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,040
Had the idea.

2011
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,480
Of okay.

2012
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,800
So the idea is like uh.

2013
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,000
Bounty Hunter.

2014
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,060
And I was like.

2015
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:35,660
Oh my god.

2016
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,360
That's so good.

2017
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,020
That's such a good idea!

2018
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,460
And then I saw it!

2019
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,640
And then like a month later, the fucking ghoul popped up!

2020
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,980
And I was like, what the fu-

2021
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,980
So, I'll tell you guys right now.

2022
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:58,720
I mean it's obvious, like the trailer was like a Bounty Hunter theme, but like yes, the theme is Bounty Hunter!

2023
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,120
So, that is all I'm gonna give you guys in terms of like hints and stuff.

2024
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,860
You'll find out next week on what it is.

2025
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,460
Anyway guys, that's really all I wanted to do for the stream.

2026
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,880
It was a short stream, but next week is gonna be a lot.

2027
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:23,440
Next week, we have also have a collab with Mint next week!

2028
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,980
We're gonna be playing a spooky game!

2029
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:30,140
So we have that, and then we have Sandland!

2030
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,020
I'm gonna talk about everything on the Sandland stream, so you better come!

2031
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,840
I- cause I know you guys are gonna like it.

2032
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,100
I know none of you guys actually watch the Sandland stream, so...

2033
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:48,140
If you wanna know behind the scenes, and maybe more hints about my new skin suit, you better come to the Sandland stream on Monday!

2034
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,380
Cause I know not a lot of people wanna watch Sandland, but I'm gonna make you guys watch Sandland!

2035
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:03,960
I know, I know Sandland is not like very popular, but you guys have- you wanna know about behind the scenes for everything!

2036
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,300
You gotta come!

2037
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,840
Hey guys!

2038
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,620
As always everybody, stay- wait, where's the camera?

2039
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,840
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around!

2040
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,720
To get that blood flowing!

2041
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,620
And if you suffer me, head to bed!

2042
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,480
Cause you deserve it!

2043
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,680
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

2044
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,660
Bye guys!

2045
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:30,860
Bye!

2046
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,600
Okay guys, I need to shimmy over to the OBS.

2047
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,160
The transition isn't as seamless as I thought it's gonna be!

2048
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,000
Bye!

2049
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,500
Bye!
