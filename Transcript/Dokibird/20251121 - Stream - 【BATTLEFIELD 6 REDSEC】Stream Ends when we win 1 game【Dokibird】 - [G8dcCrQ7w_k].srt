00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,450
You know how good it is?

20
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,910
I got top 500 yesterday.

21
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,590

22
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,690
All right, I'll show you guys I'll show you guys how fucking good this is.

23
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,370
So as you guys know, I've been playing Rink for the last two days, and in two days I got top 500.

24
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,430
With this monitor, by the way, here we go.

25
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,990
Let me pin this real quick.

26
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,790
I got the picture here.

27
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,570
Don't worry, I took the screenshot.

28
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,250
Of course I did.

29
00:06:51,310 --> 00:07:49,510
this is the per i didn't expect it to happen but this is the perfect time perfect way to chill so so i played gambit wow look at that 4.5 hours played literally start playing like two days ago the first time the first season um the new season and then i played gambit and i have only lost two games on gambit this is how sexy it looks like guys by the way i'll show you how sexy this is um look how sexy this uh this looks chat uh where is it there you go look how not the last book though like um you know like the what the pros say the pro players whenever they tweet this out like never kill yourself like

30
00:07:53,330 --> 00:08:21,930
yummy yummy so so it has 500 hertz for this monitor uh it's sexy one of the keywords so so um so that is how good this msi monitor is i literally by purchasing this monitor you can get top five not me top 500 and then there's the little asterisk not everyone could get top 500.

31
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,490
You just, this monitor doesn't actually guarantee you top 500.

32
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,480
So, yeah, results may vary, not guaranteed.

33
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,660
You had a little disclaimer on the bottom.

34
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,800
So, you know, it's been pretty good.

35
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,800
It's been pretty good.

36
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,740
Anyway, let me read it.

37
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,600
Let me make sure.

38
00:08:47,200 --> 00:09:22,260

48
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,660
That's the thing.

49
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,740

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,560
But if your name gets picked, you gotta make sure you do the challenge and send a screenshot of it to the Dokey merch or DM.

By the way, I have to off-roll.

66
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:00,820
Um, not because, like, it's in the rules, but, like, um, because of the comps we're running, I have to off-roll.

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,860

68
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,620

87
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,490

94
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,310
Is that too much to ask for?

95
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,210
Oh my god, there were four people living here?

96
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,310

00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,560
Hey, I'm a V-tuber.

230
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,460

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,900
Also, to my sound gap, is everyone okay?

234
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,060
I don't know if my sound team is alive.

235
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,600
All right.

236
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,580
Bro, where do we go?

237
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm just following Axel, but I don't think Axel knows.

238
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,680
Oh, I don't know.

239
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,160
Yeah, let's just do it.

240
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
I don't know how to do the missions.

241
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,180
Yeah, how do we do the missions out there?

242
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,660
I think they press M.

243
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,600
And if we finish the missions around the map, we get experience and some really good loot.

244
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,920
Where's the missions?

245
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,360
Oh, three missions nearby.

246
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,080
Decryption, evasion, the script, aligned.

247
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,100
Oh, that's true.

248
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,900
That was a signal hack.

249
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,100
I don't know how to do this, but let's do it.

250
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,220
Oh, there's a signal hack.

253
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,960
All right, align the antenna.

254
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,980
Go to the other antenna so we can line together.

255
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,340
All right, it's over there.

256
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:40,760
Yeah.

257
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,320

00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,600
I'm not aligning this.

259
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,500
Signal string.

No hose or watch it.

264
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,280

266
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,240

I'm covering.

273
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,860
I hear shots from the northeast.

274
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,960
I hear so many shots.

275
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,480
Did we do the mission?

276
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,380
Northeast 30.

00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,040
Mission completed.

Come on, guys.

360
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,750

362
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,550
Don't worry.

363
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,270
You can't be hoarded.

364
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,610
We're redistributing wealth.

365
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,410
Oh, I don't know about that, dude.

366
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,690
We're here to redistribute.

367
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,170
That's what it means.

368
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,930
Actually, I swear to God, if I die...

369
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,550
Oh, one of us.

370
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,270

I think this one's gonna go...

373
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,070
Are you against the team leader or you're against?

374
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,510
Oh, thank you.

375
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,590
If you die now, I can get you...

376
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,150
Oh, okay.

377
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,870
I got the squad.

378
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,550
Leader, what is this merch that's just dropped?

379
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,450
Axel, did we drop merch?

380
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,630
Uh, did I drop merch?

381
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:30,990
When?

382
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,930
Did we drop merch?

383
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:32,730
When?

384
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,410
I don't know which much.

385
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:36,850
What did we draw merch?

386
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,830
Did we draw merch?

387
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,990
Oh, I'm going to slow down.

388
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,170
Oh, that's not good.

389
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,870
Guys, we won't be safe here, so we got to leave.

390
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,650
I got shot from somewhere north.

391
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,370
Looks like this way.

392
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,250
All right, I go.

393
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,450
I'll go west.

394
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,390
Oh my god, Nukem.

395
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:56,870
Wow.

396
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,230
It's on me.

397
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,050
It's actually on me.

398
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,810
Oh my god, guys.

399
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,690
You guys have to rest me now.

400
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,490
You're gonna have to rest me after.

Yeah, Mr. Nukem is like in fucking Narinia, bro.

426
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,690
But Mr. Nukem ditched us.

427
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:30,770
Shall we do a mission?

428
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,850
Wait, this is defying the laws of gravity.

429
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,050
How the fuck are they going up?

430
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,470

431
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,330
Custom weapon drop.

432
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,210
Custom weapon drop.

433
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:38,610
Let's go to that.

434
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,030
Oh, that's what he was going to.

435
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,010
Guys, we can't let Nukem die.

436
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,890
We let him die.

437
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,310
Wait, wait.

438
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:43,890

00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,230
Someone dropping.

Oh, wait.

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,470
He's gonna get really, really good gun.

448
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,250
So we gotta be careful.

449
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:51,650
He's dead.

450
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:52,290
He's dead.

451
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:52,970
Oh, shit.

452
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,270

What?

456
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,210
Oh, I can't do that.

00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,730

472
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,410
I don't remember what they look like.

473
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,530
They have the little thing on top, right?

474
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:18,910

481
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,550
I knew it.

482
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:27,670
I knew it.

483
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,910
I knew it.

484
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,990

485
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,170
Bro, okay.

486
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,490
What did the Australians win?

487
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:30,790
How?

488
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,730
Wait, but like, how would you lose the war?

489
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,870
They literally threw criminals on the island.

490
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,650
Like, don't you guys go hard?

491
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,150
Like, why else did they banish you from the United Kingdom?

492
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,650
Banish who?

493
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,930
That's how Australians were born.

494
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,230
They took all the criminals from the United Kingdom and then shipped them to Australia.

495
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,550
Oh, yeah, yeah.

496
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,150
That's what I'm saying.

497
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,430
So how did you guys lose the war?

498
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:59,670
What do you mean?

499
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,750
How did you lose the war against animals?

500
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,070
It's all against animals.

501
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,910
Yeah.

502
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:07,710
I don't know.

503
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:15,250
I thought you guys were talking about like the people losing to the British people.

504
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,510
No, I'm talking about the evil war.

505
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,210
Yeah, who cares?

506
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,310
Yeah, I'm talking about the evil war.

507
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:20,370
I don't know.

508
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,830
Fuck, maybe they thought that'll...

509
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,290

You ran?

513
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,470
Because only a squad or three were sent to shoot them.

514
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,130
Over time, they learned to send out scouts to warn the flight to run.

515
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,130
That's insane.

516
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,010

I'm so sad.

522
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,390

00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,330

617
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,180
She just goes in, sneaks in, and chucks a little bit.

618
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,940
Wait, airstrike?

619
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,120
I'll be okay in this house, right?

620
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,040
Let's move over houses.

621
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,400
No, I should be okay.

622
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,000
They won't know.

623
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:48,480

00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,620
Hit one for 38.

628
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,300
They're going over this way.

629
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,240
Yeah, they redeploy.

630
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,700
They're outside the map though.

631
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,060
I'm trying to, I'm just trying to find a better gun.

632
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,840
Oh no, there's no more better guns.

633
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,140
That's the best we can get.

634
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,560
Oh, I knocked one.

635
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,280
We did?

636
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:51,620
Nice.

637
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,940
He said I hit something.

638
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,180
We're going over right side, right side, right side.

639
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:55,820
Right side?

640
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,540
Oh, I see, I see them.

641
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,700
This gun is really bad to shoot, though.

642
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,000
So, I don't know how much I can help.

643
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,700
I don't see it.

644
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,880
What the fuck is shooting people under the re-deploy?

645
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:10,280
17?

646
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,120

125 on the ball.

648
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,700
I hit 33 on flesh.

649
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,620
I feel like this is going to be bad if we...

650
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,080
63.

651
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,320
They're going right side, right side, right side.

652
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,020
They're going right side?

653
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:21,600

Oh, they're shooting back.

656
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,600
How dare they shoot back?

657
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,200

00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,260

661

670
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,100

671
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,620

The monitor is NA locked, but if you do win the monitor and you're outside of NA, MSI will work with you to get in-country equivalent or a Steam wallet code of equivalent value.

764
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,740
So just let you guys know for the monitor.

01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:37,720
Why is this magazine gold yellow?

946
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:38,600
It's like piss color.

947
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,600

01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,840
Well, that's a, you know, problem.

957
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,320
More, more, more, more, more.

959
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,260

Die, die, die, die.

Someone west, I think.

963
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,760
There was one more person, I think.

964
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,500
Guys, I don't know what's going on.

965
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,180

968
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,340
What the heck am I using?

969
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,900
Oh, by the way, I dropped a shotgun.

970
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:16,960
That was actually a shotgun.

971
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:17,600
I lied.

972
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,300
Yeah, I kind of noticed it was a shotgun.

973
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,940
It looked like a sniper.

974
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,060
I was like, whoa.

975
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:25,980
It's so long.

976
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,140
Like a sniper rifle.

977
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:28,980
Why?

978
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:29,280
Thank you.

979
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:32,500
I killed like five people here.

980
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,140
Axel, I have a weapon for you.

981
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:36,160
Huh?

982
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,060
I have a weapon.

983
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:37,280
weapon.

984
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:37,620
Come here.

985
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:39,700
What's this?

986
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:40,780
Check it out, man.

987
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,600
What the fuck is this?

988
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:43,200
Oh, shit.

989
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:43,560
Nice.

990
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,060
It's a railgun.

991
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:45,640
Huh?

992
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,080
I found your railgun.

993
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,160
Yeah, give it a try.

994
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,060
Ooh, artillery strike.

995
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,180
I want that.

996
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,020
Someone's over here.

997
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,360
Over here.

998
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:53,620
Over here.

999
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:54,220
Oh, my God.

1000
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:54,800
I just saw him.

1001
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,960
He literally landed right next to us.

1002
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:56,520
Raider next to us.

1003
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,940
He literally landed in front of me.

1004
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1005
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,220

Nice.

1008
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,140
We got all of them.

1009
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:04,700
What the fuck?

1010
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,180
Why are they?

1011
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,060

Someone else take it for responsibility.

1015
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,640
Try shooting this.

1016
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:37,380
Try shooting this.

1017
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:38,580

1018
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:40,880
Huh?

1019
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:41,780
Vehicle.

1020
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:42,180
Vehicle.

1021
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,220
No, don't shoot that vehicle.

1022
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,240
We'll need this car.

1023
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:45,940
No, no, no.

1024
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,820
Should have blown up and killed us off.

1025
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,480
Yeah, it's okay.

1026
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,340
No, no, no, no, no.

1027
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,260
Do not kill us.

1028
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:51,860
Do not kill us.

1029
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,820
I worked too hard to be killed right now.

1030
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,460
Oh, wait.

1031
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,260
Oh, I like, oh, I like P20.

1032
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,440
I'll take an ammo drop.

1033
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:07,020
I have the P20, and then I'll grab the car by.

1034
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:10,560
Okay, we're really far from the zone, so let's start moving in.

1035
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll agree.

1036
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,240
We have a car.

1037
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:15,140
We can move in with the car, guys.

1038
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,940
We could also blow it up.

1039
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:17,740
That'd be pretty cool.

1040
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,940
We can, okay, how about this?

1041
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,220
We drive a car into someone and then blow it up.

1042
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:22,380
Yeah.

1043
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,100
Oh, I like it.

1044
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,220
Yeah, yeah, you like, yeah.

1045
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,260
I'm cooking right now.

1046
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,820
Guys, I don't like being the fucking driver.

1047
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:31,720
Well, you don't want me driving.

1048
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,780
Let's go to the defense nexus and just sit in the house and wait.

1049
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,620
This is our best bet.

1050
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,080
Also, there's people fighting defense nexus right now, so I don't know now.

1051
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,300
But we got a car.

1052
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,520
But the thing is, is that if this car blows up, we're all just dead, you know?

1053
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,380
Yeah, but then it requires to blow up our car.

1054
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,240
Just don't get blown up, forehead.

1055
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:55,860
Yeah.

1056
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,680
I think it's safe right now.

1057
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:15,170
kind of sucks after constantly carry this when i'm like lng kit we just stay here wait let's find a good defensible position oh

1058
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:35,700
wait there is another shotgun hey guys there's a blue shotgun over there where do we wait i'm away here actually no we should wait in a room where like there's no entrances and exits or Maybe there's one exit.

1059
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,620
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute.

1060
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:41,060
That makes no sense.

1061
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,920
I'm going to find a room and I'm going to live there.

1062
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,060
Maybe right here.

1063
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:47,240
Isha.

1064
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,400
Where are you living?

1065
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,120
Where's your...

1066
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,400
What apartment did you rent?

1067
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,120
Stop stalking me.

1068
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,420
I'm in my own place.

1069
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,960
Away from you crazy people.

1070
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:57,660
Oh, hi, Doki.

1071
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:58,660
Oh, what's you people?

1072
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,260
I'm renting this room.

1073
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,200
What do you mean, you people, huh?

1074
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,300
You know what I mean.

1075
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,280
Whoa!

1076
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,040
Wait, that's a one-drop place to us.

1077
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:06,960
We can probably look for it.

1078
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,220
Oh, you're gonna go grab it?

1079
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,700
All right, I'll cover you.

1080
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:10,500
I'll cover you.

1081
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,180
Don't worry, I got you, bro.

1082
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,580
I got the high ground.

1083
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,980
You got the finest two covers right here.

1084
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:19,220
I've never let anybody down.

1085
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,620
Yeah, I have, but not this time.

1086
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:23,640
People, people, people.

1087
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,140
Watch out, they're running over.

1088
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,040
All of Mississippi.

1089
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:27,980
Where?

1090
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,620
Oh, this way?

1091
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,900
Okay, I'm coming over.

1092
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,060
Oh, at Axel?

1093
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:33,820
Okay.

1094
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,820
I hear them.

1095
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,540
Ow, ow, ow.

1096
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,220
Wait, I don't have like an angle here.

1097
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,580
Oh, I got one.

1098
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,820
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1099
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,620
Wait, with the rail gun?

1100
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:48,580
That's crazy.

1101
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:49,920
Where are they?

1102
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:50,700
They're right at that smoke.

1103
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,760
Oh, I see them.

1104
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:54,340
Right here?

1105
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,680
Is there someone running below me?

1106
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:56,940
Oh, no, but...

1107
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,180
That area looks bad to me.

1108
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,620
I don't have long range gun.

1109
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:00,200
Inside, inside.

1110
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,620
Oh, on my ass.

1111
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:03,100
What?

1112
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,760
It takes so long the rail gun.

1113
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,700
Can't be just fucking...

1114
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,900
Bro, it's a rail gun.

1115
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,060
Have you never used a rail gun?

1116
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,120
I don't play Western games.

1117
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,120
I'm sorry, guys.

1118
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:12,760
I'm sorry.

1119
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,320
Res Axel, he has a rail gun.

1120
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,260
Res Axel.

1121
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,400
Bro, that's crazy.

1122
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,560
I realized my gun is not long range.

1123
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,720
Wait, the Axel's coming back in.

1124
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,100
We stay here.

1125
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:25,940
We stay here.

1126
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:26,380
We'll live.

1127
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,260
It's a section 25.

1128
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,500
The forbidden section.

1129
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,920
Okay, this one is definitely more firing.

1130
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,200
Ooh, more ammo.

1131
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,460
I can give more ammo to people if needed.

1132
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,300
Air strike, air strike, watch out.

1133
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:40,580
Where?

1134
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,180
No, section!

1135
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,380
Oh, no!

1136
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,740
I'm coming over, I'm coming over!

1137
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,680
Yeah, there's a lot of good loot on, like, sections body.

1138
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,680
We gotta save his ass.

1139
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:49,420
We gotta save his ass.

1140
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,700
Saving, saving, saving.

1141
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,860
Oh, I'm getting shot.

1142
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:54,620
Oh, no.

1143
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,300
No!

1144
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,280
Oh, no, I'm leaving.

1145
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:56,900
I'm leaving.

1146
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,240
I'm leaving.

1147
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,640
Guys, maybe this was not the perfect place to live.

1148
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,200
Just maybe.

1149
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,700
Fucking couch noodles.

1150
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:06,560
Right up, Doki.

1151
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:07,700
Right up.

1152
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:08,260
Okay.

1153
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:08,820
No.

1154
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,400
I'm trying to head over to the next closest redeploy.

1155
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,960
Oh, this is a little.

1156
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:20,500
Oh, I'm getting artillery strike right here, but it's okay.

1157
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,240
Why is this game so hard?

1158
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,600
You think they're right below me?

1159
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,660
I missed the days of PUBG.

1160
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,460
Guys, guys, do you think they're right below me?

1161
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:33,920
You got this.

1162
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,740
You think I got it?

1163
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:37,100
Uh-huh.

1164
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:37,980
You know what?

1165
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:38,840
I'm going to be a little evil.

1166
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,800
No, I don't believe you got this.

1167
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:41,280
You're right.

1168
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:43,700
Sometimes you need a doubter, you know?

1169
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,420
You're right.

1170
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,320
You're so right.

1171
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,380
Wait, no, no, Ducky, no.

1172
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,060
You're so right.

1173
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,440
Why do I even try?

1174
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,100
No!

1175
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,380
You're so right.

1176
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,940
No, yes.

1177
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,200
Just give up right now.

1178
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:01,760
No, yes.

1179
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:57,840

I'm gonna go loot my dead body again.

1181
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,440
You are not gonna loot your dead body.

1182
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,700
Yes, I am.

1183
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,960
You are not gonna loot your dead body.

1184
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:12,060
I'm going so hard.

1185
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,460
There's a- You're stopping me.

1186
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,820
It's a bad idea.

1187

You know what I'm gonna do?

1188
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,980
I'm gonna loot my dead body.

1189

Ah!

1191
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,780

1199
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,180
We're going to run in the open field, saving private section.

1200
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,140
Oh, bro, a chopper.

There's a chopper here.

1204
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,320
You want to use a chopper.

1205
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,140
Whoa, this chopper is like on fire.

01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:21,600
Holy shit.

Yeah, this is why we don't use the chopper.

01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,220
Hey, if I die, I die.

1209

01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:42,300

There's no way.

1234
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,900
Unless they throw an artillery strike, we're fine here.

1235
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,500
Yeah, unless they use that one ability that everybody has.

A dick move.

Also, there's still 20 squads.

1573
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,200
I feel like I've been fighting a goddamn war.

1574
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:13,920
All right.

1575
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,640

1605
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:08,700

Below us, below us.

1610
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:12,840
Don't worry, I have their backs.

1611
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:13,180
I have their backs.

1612
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:14,620

02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:28,380
Get domed.

02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:30,320
I think they res.

1626
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:31,300

1628
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,760
Not sure if he was related, though.

1629
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,900
What is this fucking beeping sound?

1630
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,160

1631
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:38,540

That's right.

1875
02:23:50,590 --> 02:23:52,070
To the next building we go to.

1876
02:23:53,530 --> 02:23:55,170
We can't keep riding in the same building.

1877
02:23:55,370 --> 02:23:56,010
We gotta keep moving.

1878
02:23:56,310 --> 02:23:57,410

1916
02:26:01,470 --> 02:26:02,170
Let's go from the right side.

1917
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:02,750
I'm on the right side.

1918
02:26:03,730 --> 02:26:04,070

02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:13,490
We gotta go around.

1925
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:13,770
Wait, wait.

1926
02:26:13,890 --> 02:26:16,170

1934
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:24,510
Oh my God.

1935
02:26:24,570 --> 02:26:25,870
There's an entire team right there.

1936
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:27,170

1937
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:28,110

1950
02:26:52,310 --> 02:26:52,850
Oh, my God.

1951
02:26:52,850 --> 02:26:54,070
This guy's a fucking rat.

1952
02:26:54,510 --> 02:26:56,690
Bro, the guy is not going to play his game, man.

02:27:00,750 --> 02:27:02,190
Go to the zone, man.

1956
02:27:03,810 --> 02:27:05,770

Oh, never mind.

1960
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:09,550
It's a bug.

1961
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:09,850
Okay.

1962
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:14,410
I hope it was a bug because I literally just watched him run through a house.

1963
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:17,230
Like, he paced through.

1964
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:18,010

Like, okay, he was just paced through the wall.

02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:28,270
And I'm like, oh my God, what's going on?

1968
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:33,240
Don't worry.

1969
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:34,760
I gotta use my drone more.

1970
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:38,600
Yeah, you gotta use your recon more recon, man.

Yeah, you guys just don't listen.

1974
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:46,140
What did you do last game with your recon?

1975
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:48,280
I've spotted people.

1976
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:52,060
Yeah, with your eyes, but what about your abilities and your tools?

1977
02:28:52,780 --> 02:28:53,600
I pinged them.

1978
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:57,660
What about, yeah, with your eyes from the people you saw your eyes.

1979
02:28:58,660 --> 02:28:59,180
Yeah, yeah.

1980
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:02,180
Oh, you know who, you know, someone else who could do that?

1981
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:04,020

Let's go.

1990
02:29:48,710 --> 02:29:50,250
This is the real gambling.

1991
02:29:50,670 --> 02:29:51,290
No, you should do.

1992
02:29:51,510 --> 02:29:53,930
Yeah, you should do Gamba and be like, is he going to win?

1993
02:29:54,330 --> 02:29:54,950
Oh, big CSGO cases.

Am I going to get a gold?

1995
02:29:58,670 --> 02:29:59,330
You should do a prediction.

1996
02:29:59,750 --> 02:30:02,370
It was like, well, will they win this game?

1997
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:08,130
I don't feel like I even want golds anymore, even if I were to open CSGO cases.

1998
02:30:08,250 --> 02:30:09,290
Don't you want reds now?

Yeah, wherever you see the gun I found.

2002
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:46,730
Sometimes the gun disappears.

2003
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:51,200
Ow!

Use your pistol.

2011
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:03,760
Artillery is down.

2012
02:31:03,960 --> 02:31:05,040
Oh, that's not our artillery.

2013
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:06,120
Wait, that's our artillery.

2014
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:06,760
One down.

2015
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:09,820
Do we get hurt by our own artillery?

2016
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:12,200
By the way.

2017
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:13,660

No, we don't, we don't, we don't.

2019
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:16,820
We can run in with our own artillery.

02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:23,680
There we go.

2021
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:25,840

Look, how many airstrikes do they have?

2146
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:32,520
What is this?

2147
02:40:35,850 --> 02:40:37,350
Wait, what are they using?

2148
02:40:37,350 --> 02:40:38,330
What is it?

2149
02:40:38,330 --> 02:40:40,730
I don't even know because like we didn't even see anything.

2150
02:40:42,430 --> 02:40:43,690
Literally, yeah, we're not even seeing anything.

2151
02:40:43,850 --> 02:40:44,970
They're just firing something at us.

2152
02:40:45,090 --> 02:40:46,210
How many airstrikes do they have?

2153
02:40:46,450 --> 02:40:46,830
It's a mortar?

2154
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:48,190
How do I get...

2155
02:40:48,190 --> 02:40:48,770

2156
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:49,090

2157
02:40:49,310 --> 02:40:49,690
It's okay.

2158
02:40:49,730 --> 02:40:50,550
It's called a mortar.

2159
02:40:51,650 --> 02:40:52,470
A mortar?

2160
02:40:53,930 --> 02:40:55,350
Isn't that what they use with the pesto?

2161
02:40:56,350 --> 02:40:57,310
Mortar and pesto.

2162
02:40:57,570 --> 02:40:59,550

2163
02:41:00,290 --> 02:41:00,630

2165
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:02,210

02:41:02,670 --> 02:41:03,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2167
02:41:04,610 --> 02:41:05,930
You can pick it up as loot.

2168
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:10,090
Winfield, you're fucking crazy!

2169
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:12,110

02:41:12,730 --> 02:41:13,530
Oh my god, he tried.

2171
02:41:13,570 --> 02:41:15,370
I didn't realize he was going for this.

2172
02:41:15,710 --> 02:41:17,390
Okay, so there's a team that Rita put...

2173
02:41:18,510 --> 02:41:20,750
I won't say I didn't have his back.

2174
02:41:21,310 --> 02:41:21,650
Uh-huh.

02:41:22,210 --> 02:41:23,770
But, like, you know, he's...

2176
02:41:23,770 --> 02:41:24,330
But you know what?

2177
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:25,710
No one's gonna expect this.

2178
02:41:26,470 --> 02:41:27,510
Oh, hammer drop right there.

2179
02:41:28,390 --> 02:41:30,590
No one's gonna expect this, guys.

2180
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:33,650

Let's go.

2203
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:40,840

2204
02:43:42,300 --> 02:43:42,380
Ooh.

2205
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,800
Anyone wants to get in the car with me?

2206
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:45,780
No.

2207
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:48,140
I can drive.

2208
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:49,940
Hmm.

2209
02:43:52,100 --> 02:43:52,540
Hmm.

2210
02:43:57,220 --> 02:43:58,240
Above, above, above, above.

2211
02:43:58,680 --> 02:43:59,340
Windfields right next to them.

2212
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:00,580
Oh, shit.

2213
02:44:01,700 --> 02:44:02,760
I don't have Kobe.

2214
02:44:03,480 --> 02:44:04,440
No, wait, Sam.

2215
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:04,980
Don't worry.

2216
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:05,160
Don't worry.

2217
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:05,360
Don't worry.

2218
02:44:05,460 --> 02:44:06,180
I'm next to a redeploy.

2219
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:06,920
I'm next to it.

2220
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:07,200
Whoa.

2221
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:08,920
I'm dead.

2222
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:11,600
There is another team here.

2223
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:13,140
You have to redeploy me, please.

2224
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:15,740
There is a...

2225
02:44:15,740 --> 02:44:17,340
There's not a star-hot control.

2226
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:20,160
The thing is, there is literally a team right beside me, guys.

2227
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:23,760
There is a team right beside me.

2228
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:25,760
Just go out there and do a little dance.

2229
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:32,600
The moment I click that, they're all going to be, like, turning around and be like, what the fuck was that?

02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:28,040
Remember, guys, we don't want to wake up Axel.

2235
02:45:28,380 --> 02:45:30,100

2236
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:33,960

2242
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:49,000
When it was Altaira now, we got second place without Winfield.

2243
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:51,780
Toki, you wouldn't do this to Winfield.

2244
02:46:51,960 --> 02:46:53,220
He's been so great to us.

2245
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:57,700
If he's been so great to us, why haven't we got first place?

2246
02:46:58,820 --> 02:46:59,920
I'll show more back to support.

I believe in us.

2325
02:53:07,980 --> 02:53:09,700
I'm going to do an interview with Winfield.

2326
02:53:10,340 --> 02:53:10,560
Yeah.

2327
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:12,820
While we're fighting for our lives.

2328
02:53:13,380 --> 02:53:13,640
Mm-hmm.

2329
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:17,300
It's like having a subway surfer while playing a game.

2330
02:53:18,480 --> 02:53:19,540
Oh, that's you.

2331
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:21,020
Oh, yeah, that's you.

2332
02:53:21,580 --> 02:53:24,420
I think I know what to do with the reading flow power.

2333
02:53:24,900 --> 02:53:26,100
Winfield, you don't believe it.

2334
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:29,620
Even us in live, oh wait, you go there, I chill up here.

2335
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:31,480
Don't chill up here.

2336
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:31,760
Don't chill.

2337
02:53:31,860 --> 02:53:32,320
There's a team right here.

2338
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:32,900
There's a team right here.

2339
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:33,420

2340
02:53:33,560 --> 02:53:34,280
There's a team right here.

2341
02:53:34,460 --> 02:53:35,300
There's a team right here.

2342
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:37,380
There's team right here.

2343
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:38,880
There's team right here.

2344
02:53:42,860 --> 02:53:43,180
There's 19.

2345
02:53:47,980 --> 02:53:48,620
There's 19.

2346
02:53:48,860 --> 02:53:49,100
There's 19.

2347
02:53:49,300 --> 02:53:49,540
There's 19.

2348
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:50,500
No, no, look at me.

2349
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:50,740
Look at me.

2350
02:53:50,820 --> 02:53:51,680
They don't know I'm here.

2351
02:53:52,080 --> 02:53:52,500
All they do.

2352
02:53:52,860 --> 02:53:52,860
Shit.

2353
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:53,480
Never mind.

2354
02:53:54,180 --> 02:53:54,480
No.

2355
02:53:56,860 --> 02:53:57,420
That's crazy.

2356
02:53:57,640 --> 02:53:58,000
That's crazy.

2357
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:26,800
unlucky unlucky unlucky it has been it has been a pleasure but this game is bullshit man it has been a pleasure we'll adopt someone in the wild i believe Winfield, it's been a pleasure.

2358
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:28,460
It has been a pleasure, Winfield.

2359
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:29,580
But you're out.

2360
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:32,180
You're out, buddy.

2361
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:35,360
I'll forever remember you as the person who was super drunk.

2362
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:37,900
Super drunk.

2363
02:54:39,740 --> 02:54:43,320
Maybe we'll get a maybe we'll get a game re-after, Winfield.

2364
02:54:43,620 --> 02:54:45,580
You know, maybe we'll get Winfield 2.0.

2365
02:54:46,860 --> 02:54:47,320
Winnerfield.

2366
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:48,780
I believe.

2367
02:54:51,020 --> 02:54:53,820

02:58:06,260 --> 02:58:06,940
I'm so safe.

2418
02:58:07,600 --> 02:58:07,900
I'll tell you.

2419
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:08,600

Who's alive?

2427
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:19,380
Because I'm a gamer.

2428
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:21,280
You can't rely on people being gamers.

2429
02:58:21,800 --> 02:58:23,580
Nope, because it was so safe.

2430
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:26,920
I was safe.

2431
02:58:28,820 --> 02:58:32,040

2468
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:04,800
There's people on both roofs behind us.

Watch out, Doki.

2470
03:01:07,480 --> 03:01:08,280

I can't.

2482
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:31,160
I can dodge this.

2483
03:01:31,300 --> 03:01:32,380
I can dodge this.

2484
03:01:33,500 --> 03:01:34,500
I just gotta sidestep.

2485
03:01:35,100 --> 03:01:36,200
I can dodge this.

2486
03:01:36,940 --> 03:01:37,120
I can dodge this.

Don't die.

2488
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:37,880
I can dodge this.

I am so safe right now.

2539
03:04:21,360 --> 03:04:22,640
No problem, Mike.

2540
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:26,220
But we like literally use them all the redeployers.

2541
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:26,980
Oh, they're coming.

2542
03:04:32,170 --> 03:04:33,370
Wait, I hear footsteps.

2543
03:04:33,650 --> 03:04:34,450
Out, out, out, out, out.

2544
03:04:36,330 --> 03:04:36,810
Oh.

2545
03:04:39,170 --> 03:04:40,230
Oh, that was you guys.

2546
03:04:42,390 --> 03:04:44,890
Hey, what is the exclamation mark drops?

2547
03:04:45,070 --> 03:04:46,010
What does that do?

2548
03:04:47,130 --> 03:04:48,850
Uh, if a game has drops for Twitch.

2549
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:49,790
Yeah, it depends.

2550
03:04:49,970 --> 03:04:51,370
I don't know if Battlefield has drops.

2551
03:04:52,790 --> 03:05:02,150
But like, it's like the amount of hours you watch on a stream acts gives you access to like, uh, extra stuff, like custom skins or like badges or whatever.

2552
03:05:03,170 --> 03:05:03,970
It depends on the game.

2553
03:05:07,150 --> 03:05:07,630
Nice.

2554
03:05:09,170 --> 03:05:09,990

They're trying to push up.

2580
03:06:23,430 --> 03:06:24,350
This guy's second floor?

2581
03:06:25,010 --> 03:06:26,270
He's cracked.

2582
03:06:27,850 --> 03:06:29,050
Oh yeah, yeah.

2583
03:06:29,270 --> 03:06:30,130
Don't get knocked.

2584
03:06:31,450 --> 03:06:32,050
Don't get knocked.

2585
03:06:33,430 --> 03:06:34,050
No more do-over.

2586
03:06:34,070 --> 03:06:35,670
I'm heading to the next redeploy, guys.

2587

Fucking hell.

2644
03:09:09,100 --> 03:09:09,900
We're redsmapping.

2645
03:09:10,380 --> 03:09:10,920
On the bridge.

2646
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:11,300
On the bridge.

2651
03:09:18,660 --> 03:09:18,840
What?

2652
03:09:19,540 --> 03:09:19,940
Here?

2653
03:09:20,500 --> 03:09:21,180
Looks suspicious.

2654
03:09:21,620 --> 03:09:22,020
Watch yourself.

2655
03:09:23,700 --> 03:09:24,100
Apparently.

2656
03:09:28,060 --> 03:09:28,800
I'm looking.

2657
03:09:28,940 --> 03:09:30,840
There's another car here too that we can use.

2658
03:09:31,540 --> 03:09:33,140
Check your map for new mission details.

2659
03:09:34,180 --> 03:09:36,520
I feel so safe.

2660
03:09:36,820 --> 03:09:37,260
What?

2661
03:09:39,360 --> 03:09:42,180

2662
03:09:44,820 --> 03:09:46,520
Team in that building right over there.

2663
03:09:50,980 --> 03:09:52,400

2664
03:09:52,620 --> 03:09:54,100
Ping, ping, ping.

03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:55,580
Okay, I see.

2666
03:09:59,480 --> 03:10:00,360
Didn't mean to do that.

2667
03:10:02,980 --> 03:10:04,460
I got the one we filled down.

2668
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:05,360

Hanging in there.

2673
03:10:39,860 --> 03:10:40,360
Fights north of us.

2674
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:41,160
Fights north of us.

2675
03:10:42,340 --> 03:10:43,320
We can look to pick off some people.

2676
03:10:43,980 --> 03:10:45,480
I don't know where the sniper came from.

2677
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:47,560
So, like, he could still be there sniping.

2678
03:10:50,560 --> 03:10:54,320
Uh, people running across east, across the road.

2679
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:58,360
Bro, where the fuck was that sniper that fucked me up?

2680
03:10:59,660 --> 03:11:02,060
How are these bullets just not hitting?

2681
03:11:02,700 --> 03:11:04,760
I hate this custom sniper.

2682
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:07,020
It stole us.

2683
03:11:07,940 --> 03:11:08,760
Good damage.

2684
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:10,440
Where are you guys shooting at?

2685
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:12,100
Uh, east.

2686
03:11:12,480 --> 03:11:12,840
East?

2687
03:11:13,040 --> 03:11:13,760
Okay, I'm looking.

2688
03:11:14,580 --> 03:11:16,260
Hey, we're on that truck right over there.

2689
03:11:16,940 --> 03:11:18,100
It was just one guy?

2690
03:11:19,060 --> 03:11:19,740
Two people, I think.

2691
03:11:20,220 --> 03:11:22,280
Okay, so there has to be another guy there then.

2692
03:11:24,560 --> 03:11:25,980
Oh, I'm so paranoid right now.

2693
03:11:26,080 --> 03:11:27,500
They could be anywhere.

2694
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:28,380
Oh, we gotta go to zone.

2695
03:11:28,500 --> 03:11:29,140

It's my safe tunnel.

2757
03:19:39,760 --> 03:19:40,660
I'm a little worm.

2758
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:43,380
I'm an old caterpillar in my chrysalis.

2759
03:19:44,160 --> 03:19:46,900

2760

I don't remember.

2770
03:20:07,100 --> 03:20:10,980
Alright, then I guess I'll go to the next read-a-play and hope that one is safe.

2771
03:20:18,640 --> 03:20:19,980
That's a chopper.

2772
03:20:20,220 --> 03:20:22,140

2773
03:20:22,140 --> 03:20:23,740

2774
03:20:23,860 --> 03:20:25,740
Oh, wait, that was the read-a-play.

2775
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:27,360
I went to the goddamn mellic.

2776
03:20:27,500 --> 03:20:28,260
Oh, wait, no, it's over here.

2777

Hey, the chopper strat is a method, you know?

2779
03:20:35,120 --> 03:20:35,820
It is a method.

2780
03:20:36,340 --> 03:20:38,660
Until they shoot gunners down.

2781
03:20:40,040 --> 03:20:41,300
Just don't get gunned down.

2782
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:43,920
I don't like this because I'm on low ground too.

2783
03:20:45,220 --> 03:20:45,840
Ah, it's fine.

2784
03:20:46,400 --> 03:20:47,860

Oh, I don't care.

2960
03:30:41,250 --> 03:30:46,350
There is one redeploy all the way in the middle of the zone.

03:30:46,970 --> 03:30:47,670

2969
03:30:59,010 --> 03:31:00,250
Yeah, there's only seven squads.

2970
03:31:00,370 --> 03:31:01,750
You just gotta sit there and get I.

2971
03:31:02,190 --> 03:31:03,770
No, but he's not gonna 1v4.

2972
03:31:04,030 --> 03:31:04,650
There's no way.

2973
03:31:05,270 --> 03:31:06,530
Of course I'm gonna 1v4, huh?

2974
03:31:06,710 --> 03:31:07,570
Don't you know who I am?

2975

2978
03:31:15,390 --> 03:31:16,050
That was Prime Shroud.

2979
03:31:16,050 --> 03:31:18,090
Yeah, he's just an old man now, you know.

2980
03:31:18,370 --> 03:31:21,750
Shroud signed my Steam profile, so I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm.

2981
03:31:22,870 --> 03:31:25,810
I'm just channeling the energy that I saved since 2017.

2982
03:31:29,370 --> 03:31:30,270
Where is it?

2983
03:31:30,870 --> 03:31:31,650
Did it get used?

2984
03:31:32,010 --> 03:31:32,350
No.

2985
03:31:32,830 --> 03:31:35,690
Oh, it's getting used right now.

2986
03:31:36,210 --> 03:31:36,530
Literally.

2987
03:31:37,450 --> 03:31:38,430
Last redeploy.

2988
03:31:39,030 --> 03:31:39,810
Oh, wait, wait.

2989
03:31:40,550 --> 03:31:42,510
Someone's getting shot at that redeploy now.

2990
03:31:43,230 --> 03:31:43,530
Yeah.

2991
03:31:43,990 --> 03:31:46,810
You should rat it until they're gone and then use it again.

2992
03:31:48,130 --> 03:31:48,890
Fiverr, man.

2993
03:31:49,370 --> 03:31:49,830
Wait, wait, wait.

2994
03:31:50,070 --> 03:31:51,690
At this point, just rat in the grass.

2995
03:31:51,750 --> 03:31:52,620
You're not going to know.

2996
03:31:53,750 --> 03:31:54,470

3094
03:40:54,380 --> 03:40:54,800
We got a res.

3095
03:40:54,920 --> 03:40:56,660
Winfield, get over here.

3096
03:40:57,540 --> 03:40:58,280
Res or kick?

3097
03:40:58,700 --> 03:40:59,160
Res or kick.

3098
03:40:59,500 --> 03:41:00,380
No, let Winfield.

3099
03:41:00,580 --> 03:41:01,020
No, no, no, no.

3100
03:41:01,280 --> 03:41:02,020
Winfield has to res.

3101
03:41:02,380 --> 03:41:05,600
Winfield has to Rez or kick, Winfield.

3102
03:41:07,100 --> 03:41:08,580
Wait, why am I not not Rez?

3103
03:41:09,300 --> 03:41:09,300
Guys?

3104
03:41:09,540 --> 03:41:09,780
Guys?

3105
03:41:09,800 --> 03:41:10,700
This people, this people, this people.

3106
03:41:10,940 --> 03:41:11,500
Winfield!

3107
03:41:14,320 --> 03:41:15,440
Alright, guys.

3108
03:41:16,420 --> 03:41:20,180
Winfield, when I said Rez or kick, Winfield did not, Rez.

3109
03:41:21,800 --> 03:41:23,600
We should kick his sack.

3110
03:41:24,500 --> 03:41:25,560
It's time for it.

3111
03:41:25,620 --> 03:41:26,600
We should whack his sack.

3112
03:41:27,040 --> 03:41:27,760
It's whacking time.

3113
03:41:29,460 --> 03:41:31,420
Yeah, it's whacking time.

3114
03:41:37,750 --> 03:41:39,150
I don't see him.

3115
03:41:40,110 --> 03:41:41,110
They may have fallen back.

3116
03:41:41,770 --> 03:41:43,490
Oh, I'll throw your axe his back.

3117
03:41:43,870 --> 03:41:43,870
Hello.

3118
03:41:45,190 --> 03:41:45,990
I don't need her back.

3119
03:41:46,310 --> 03:41:46,310
Yeah.

3120
03:41:46,850 --> 03:41:47,710
I think they left.

3121
03:41:51,370 --> 03:41:53,570
Leave that man's sack alone.

3122
03:41:54,890 --> 03:41:57,090
But it's going to be lonely, right?

3123
03:41:57,470 --> 03:41:57,830
Yeah.

3124
03:41:58,570 --> 03:42:00,370
Yeah, you should hold his hand.

3125
03:42:00,710 --> 03:42:01,070
Hold his sack.

3126
03:42:01,930 --> 03:42:03,010
Axel, you hold his sack?

3127
03:42:03,110 --> 03:42:04,590

03:42:38,880 --> 03:42:39,680
Winfield's wild.

3131
03:42:42,280 --> 03:42:42,640
Oh, shit.

3132
03:42:42,940 --> 03:42:43,120

Oh, my God.

3138
03:42:53,410 --> 03:42:54,810
It's not it.

3139
03:42:56,270 --> 03:42:57,030
I have to leave.

3140
03:42:59,290 --> 03:43:00,430
Oh, my God.

3141
03:43:02,930 --> 03:43:03,670
See, Bobby?

3142
03:43:04,350 --> 03:43:05,010

03:43:05,230 --> 03:43:06,570

3144

3145
03:43:07,170 --> 03:43:07,510
He's on me.

3146
03:43:10,650 --> 03:43:11,510
Where are these guys?

3147
03:43:12,850 --> 03:43:13,150
I don't know.

3148
03:43:13,290 --> 03:43:13,490
I don't know.

3149
03:43:13,630 --> 03:43:14,030
I'm just...

3150
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:20,840
One HP on me.

3151
03:43:21,380 --> 03:43:21,740

3152
03:43:21,860 --> 03:43:22,240
I need reload.

3153
03:43:22,500 --> 03:43:22,760
Oh my god.

3154
03:43:23,380 --> 03:43:23,380
Okay.

3155
03:43:27,340 --> 03:43:28,280
Are you okay or nah?

3156
03:43:28,920 --> 03:43:29,420
I'm dead.

3157
03:43:29,560 --> 03:43:29,720
I'm dead.

3158
03:43:29,940 --> 03:43:30,260
Okay.

3159
03:43:30,540 --> 03:43:31,260
We're not okay.

3160
03:43:34,700 --> 03:43:35,660
I'm just gonna leave.

3161
03:43:36,640 --> 03:43:37,440
I don't trust.

3162
03:43:38,480 --> 03:43:39,580
I don't trust.

why were you a hero?

3165
03:44:10,960 --> 03:44:11,320
Hello.

3166
03:44:12,440 --> 03:44:13,040
Oh my god, hey.

3167
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:14,800
Never be a hero.

3168
03:44:16,240 --> 03:44:17,380
But I was born to be one.

3169
03:44:17,640 --> 03:44:18,240
Never be a hero.

3170
03:44:19,700 --> 03:44:22,280
Yeah, sometimes you can change your career path.

3171
03:44:25,160 --> 03:44:27,160
What if the world depends on you being a hero?

3172
03:44:27,540 --> 03:44:27,920
No, I don't.

3173
03:44:28,060 --> 03:44:28,940
Wait, die, die, die, die, die, die.

3174
03:44:29,740 --> 03:44:30,240
Wait, what?

3175
03:44:30,280 --> 03:44:31,060
Die, Winfield, die.

3176
03:44:31,520 --> 03:44:32,740
Winfield, die, Winfield!

3177
03:44:32,920 --> 03:44:33,280
Winfield!

3178
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:33,840
Yay!

3179
03:44:35,220 --> 03:44:35,580
Wait.

3180
03:44:36,360 --> 03:44:37,340
I don't think he made it.

3181
03:44:37,420 --> 03:44:38,300
Oh, Winfield, you first.

3182
03:44:38,320 --> 03:44:40,300
Oh my god.

3183
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:41,040
Winfield.

3184
03:44:43,780 --> 03:44:44,260
Winfield.

3185
03:44:45,140 --> 03:44:46,320
Alright, let's keep going forward.

3186
03:44:48,320 --> 03:44:49,720
Oh, Winfield.

3187
03:44:50,600 --> 03:44:54,980
If we circle around security gate, it should be a little bit, should be a little bit safer, right?

3188
03:44:55,300 --> 03:45:00,520
I mean, Axel, okay, I was surprised Axel didn't try to redeploy to the other redeploy.

3189
03:45:00,820 --> 03:45:02,200
So like...

3190
03:45:03,940 --> 03:45:05,060
Where's the redeploy?

3191
03:45:05,620 --> 03:45:05,980
Ah!

3192
03:45:08,740 --> 03:45:09,180
Nice.

3193

3342
03:53:03,750 --> 03:53:06,370
I'm bravely sprinting as fast as I can away from the area.

3343
03:53:07,450 --> 03:53:07,870
Relocating.

3344
03:53:08,370 --> 03:53:09,470
Oh, can I not climb that?

03:53:09,510 --> 03:53:10,070

03:53:10,370 --> 03:53:11,910
Wait, but what if I...

3378
03:54:28,430 --> 03:54:30,090
Sniper does not work with this ping.

There's no loot.

3398
03:56:15,390 --> 03:56:16,350
This is the game.

3399
03:56:16,770 --> 03:56:17,330
I believe.

3400
03:56:18,550 --> 03:56:19,050
This is it.

3401
03:56:19,190 --> 03:56:19,590
This is it.

3402
03:56:19,930 --> 03:56:20,730
This is the game.

3403
03:56:23,150 --> 03:56:24,350
Axel, we need it from you too.

3404
03:56:24,550 --> 03:56:25,090

03:56:25,310 --> 03:56:25,510
Yeah.

3406
03:56:25,830 --> 03:56:26,470

03:56:27,130 --> 03:56:27,370
Yeah.

3408
03:56:29,690 --> 03:56:30,090
Yeah.

3409
03:56:31,530 --> 03:56:31,930
Okay.

3410
03:56:32,050 --> 03:56:33,010
There's no gun in this house.

3411
03:56:33,050 --> 03:56:34,270
I can't even find a single container.

3412
03:56:35,290 --> 03:56:36,310
Wait, there's no guns here.

3413
03:56:36,490 --> 03:56:37,050
Where are the guns?

3414
03:56:37,170 --> 03:56:37,830
You know what?

3415
03:56:38,130 --> 03:56:38,950

Where are you?

3419
03:56:41,750 --> 03:56:42,110
Should we do a mission then?

3420
03:56:42,590 --> 03:56:42,910
Great.

3421
03:56:44,050 --> 03:56:45,170
Wait, where is Axel?

3422
03:56:45,470 --> 03:56:49,990
Maybe I should just fucking go in a chopper and just go fucking like kill myself, you know, like...

3423
03:56:49,990 --> 03:56:53,750
Wait, you go into chopper and then like, like fly into an enemy.

04:01:42,880 --> 04:01:43,180
It's okay.

3456
04:01:43,220 --> 04:01:44,000
I'm in the garage.

3457
04:01:44,200 --> 04:01:45,800
No one ever checks the garage.

3458
04:01:47,280 --> 04:01:48,080
I'm in the...

3459
04:01:48,080 --> 04:01:50,200
No one ever checks the garage.

3460
04:01:50,900 --> 04:01:54,280
Ah, always rat thing, Mr. Dolphy.

3461
04:01:56,140 --> 04:01:58,400
I don't know how you guys died.

3462
04:01:59,840 --> 04:02:01,260
Shit, this fucking...

3463
04:02:01,260 --> 04:02:05,040
These fuckers rolled up in a tank and decided to just fuck me in a house.

3464
04:02:05,380 --> 04:02:09,980
Yeah, I'm saying we could have all been in the garage.

3465
04:02:10,260 --> 04:02:12,100
But I don't know why you guys were running around.

3466
04:02:12,500 --> 04:02:13,860
Oki, we could have all died together.

3467
04:02:14,120 --> 04:02:14,480
Come on.

3468
04:02:14,540 --> 04:02:15,660
We could have all been.

3469
04:02:15,800 --> 04:02:16,720
Yeah, and I'm alive.

3470
04:02:16,840 --> 04:02:18,480
I write my fucking story.

3471
04:02:19,260 --> 04:02:19,860
Oh, my God.

3472
04:02:19,940 --> 04:02:21,340
There's a dud through our...

3473
04:02:21,340 --> 04:02:22,900
What is wrong with this neighborhood?

3474
04:02:23,100 --> 04:02:24,800
There was like four things in this neighborhood.

3475
04:02:25,020 --> 04:02:26,320
This is why the rent's so cheap, Oki.

3476
04:02:28,620 --> 04:02:30,780
Honestly, I would do that too if I was in America.

3477
04:02:31,260 --> 04:02:33,920
I'll just buy a Glock to keep my rent cheap.

3478
04:02:34,200 --> 04:02:34,920
That's what I'm saying.

3479
04:02:35,040 --> 04:02:36,080
That's what I said last week.

3480
04:02:36,460 --> 04:02:39,160
Keep the crime rate high to make the rent cheap.

3481
04:02:39,800 --> 04:02:40,560
Yeah, I'll just like...

3482
04:02:40,560 --> 04:02:42,040
I wake up on a Sunday morning.

3483
04:02:42,120 --> 04:02:43,280
Oh, it's a nice day.

3484
04:02:43,340 --> 04:02:45,720
I'll whip up my Glock, and then I just start going, Baa, Baa, Baa.

3485
04:02:46,120 --> 04:02:46,780
Forgetting in there.

3486
04:02:48,380 --> 04:02:50,100
You gotta do it the way that...

3487
04:02:50,100 --> 04:02:51,520
Oh, my God.

3488
04:02:51,800 --> 04:02:52,080
Okay.

3489
04:02:54,920 --> 04:02:55,800
Okay, guys.

3490
04:02:57,440 --> 04:03:01,240

Oh, there is literally a team right in front of me.

3495
04:04:37,600 --> 04:04:38,880
I don't know if you guys saw the flashes.

3496
04:04:39,540 --> 04:04:40,780
The flashes on my map.

3497
04:04:41,120 --> 04:04:41,940
Do you see that?

3498
04:04:42,320 --> 04:04:44,780
They're like having a little rave party in front of me.

3499
04:04:46,040 --> 04:04:47,240
These are the cute trees.

3500
04:04:47,780 --> 04:04:48,360
There's a little rave party.

3501
04:04:48,600 --> 04:04:50,080
And then there's a team to my role.

3502
04:04:50,360 --> 04:04:51,120
Look at that.

3503
04:04:51,400 --> 04:04:53,960
They're having a party in those trees right now.

3504
04:04:54,560 --> 04:04:54,840
Having a gun.

3505
04:04:54,840 --> 04:04:55,420
The fire approaches.

3506
04:04:55,680 --> 04:04:58,560
And then there's like a team that's on the car.

3507

3512
04:05:36,260 --> 04:05:37,760
Mr. Poopsie.

Mr. Poopsie.

Okay, I can still hug the ring.

3515
04:05:44,460 --> 04:05:46,720
I can still hug the ring a little bit.

3516
04:05:47,300 --> 04:05:48,560
There's a UAV above.

3517
04:05:49,100 --> 04:05:49,980

Oh, yeah.

3559
04:08:30,720 --> 04:08:31,480

Be host.

3561
04:08:32,480 --> 04:08:33,540

Well, I'm just too tired already.

3566
04:08:41,240 --> 04:08:42,900
Speaking of pussies, Winfield's back.

3567
04:08:43,380 --> 04:08:44,500
Wait, how did he come back?

3568
04:08:44,620 --> 04:08:45,120

3569
04:08:45,120 --> 04:08:45,900
I don't know.

3570
04:08:47,340 --> 04:08:47,740
Wait, how did...

3571
04:08:47,740 --> 04:08:48,340

3572
04:08:48,600 --> 04:08:49,480

3573
04:08:50,240 --> 04:08:50,840

04:09:30,820 --> 04:09:32,260
I'm going to check Winfield's stats.

3580
04:09:32,400 --> 04:09:34,580
I'm having trouble believing he's won a game now.

3581
04:09:38,100 --> 04:09:39,200

3639
04:13:47,220 --> 04:13:47,620
Winfield.

3640
04:13:47,920 --> 04:13:48,600
Someone just...

3641
04:13:48,600 --> 04:13:50,040
Someone just parachuted above.

3642
04:13:51,220 --> 04:13:51,740
Up on the roof.

3643
04:13:52,160 --> 04:13:52,360
North.

3644
04:13:53,120 --> 04:13:53,980
Right over here.

3645
04:13:54,400 --> 04:13:56,200

3646
04:13:57,440 --> 04:13:57,880
Ah.

3647
04:13:59,900 --> 04:14:00,560

3648
04:14:01,120 --> 04:14:01,560

04:22:18,400 --> 04:22:18,820
Oh, no.

3728
04:22:18,820 --> 04:22:19,280
Oh, the zone's coming in.

3729
04:22:19,520 --> 04:22:19,840
The zone.

3730
04:22:20,140 --> 04:22:22,760
No, our beautiful spot.

3731
04:22:23,140 --> 04:22:23,820
I think we're fine.

3732
04:22:23,920 --> 04:22:25,540
I think we're fine for now if we decide to move.

3733
04:22:26,780 --> 04:22:29,240
We just move at the very end, you know.

3734
04:22:29,280 --> 04:22:29,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3735
04:22:29,840 --> 04:22:30,200
That's true.

3736
04:22:30,260 --> 04:22:30,720
That's true.

3737
04:22:31,080 --> 04:22:32,080
Oh, it's slowly shrinking.

3738
04:22:32,320 --> 04:22:35,060
Or we can go to ground the zero, like the house.

3739
04:22:35,240 --> 04:22:37,040
I don't think we'll make it.

3740
04:22:38,660 --> 04:22:39,340
I don't know.

3741
04:22:39,600 --> 04:22:40,240
We'll make it.

3742
04:22:40,280 --> 04:22:42,240
Do you see that tiny house over there in the middle?

3743
04:22:42,820 --> 04:22:44,440
Oh, people on ping, people on ping.

3744
04:22:46,040 --> 04:22:46,820
That's close by.

3745
04:22:47,080 --> 04:22:48,180
That is very close by.

3746
04:22:48,180 --> 04:22:49,000
They're going to walk in.

3747
04:22:49,500 --> 04:22:49,860
It's okay.

3748
04:22:50,040 --> 04:22:52,680
We'll wait for them to walk in.

3749
04:22:54,720 --> 04:22:55,920
I think we can wait, right?

3750
04:22:56,060 --> 04:22:57,360
Do we rotate or wait, guys?

3751
04:22:57,480 --> 04:22:59,060
Let's have a decision together.

3752
04:22:59,600 --> 04:23:00,300
Let's have a vote.

3753
04:23:02,300 --> 04:23:04,980
Well, I probably have 30 seconds until my next turn.

3754
04:23:07,840 --> 04:23:10,080
Because we could try and go too late.

3755
04:23:10,280 --> 04:23:10,560
They're still there.

3756
04:23:10,840 --> 04:23:11,380
They're still there.

3757
04:23:11,520 --> 04:23:11,840
They're still there?

3758
04:23:12,900 --> 04:23:15,800
Do you think we'll make it if we just book it to this house?

3759
04:23:16,680 --> 04:23:18,680
We are fucked, ladies and gentlemen.

3760
04:23:19,460 --> 04:23:19,760
That house?

3761
04:23:20,240 --> 04:23:20,580
That house?

3762
04:23:20,720 --> 04:23:21,340
You see that house?

3763
04:23:21,520 --> 04:23:22,020
You see that?

3764
04:23:22,400 --> 04:23:24,280
There's no way we can make it to the house.

3765
04:23:24,520 --> 04:23:26,160
You gotta believe, man.

3766
04:23:26,520 --> 04:23:26,840
You gotta...

3767
04:23:26,840 --> 04:23:27,700
Oh, their artillery strike.

3768
04:23:27,760 --> 04:23:29,380
I think this is the time we gotta move.

3769
04:23:29,500 --> 04:23:29,800
We gotta move.

3770
04:23:29,900 --> 04:23:30,400
They are artillery strike.

3771
04:23:30,500 --> 04:23:30,620
Okay.

3772
04:23:31,060 --> 04:23:31,240
Okay.

3773
04:23:32,540 --> 04:23:33,620
All right, we gotta move to that house.

3774
04:23:33,660 --> 04:23:34,560
You saw the house I pinged?

3775
04:23:35,920 --> 04:23:36,060
Yeah.

3776
04:23:36,380 --> 04:23:37,120
Where's the exit?

3777
04:23:37,960 --> 04:23:39,400
You can just jump through the window here.

3778
04:23:41,360 --> 04:23:42,160
Just a little bit loud.

3779
04:23:44,580 --> 04:23:46,380
Oh my god, there's a car right in there.

3780
04:23:46,800 --> 04:23:48,020
There's a fucking car.

3781
04:23:49,220 --> 04:23:49,320
Fuck it.

3782
04:23:49,420 --> 04:23:50,020
We just run.

3783
04:23:50,400 --> 04:23:51,020
Okay, okay, okay.

3784
04:23:51,780 --> 04:23:52,460
Okay, okay.

3785
04:23:52,920 --> 04:23:56,580

Okay.

3789
04:24:02,520 --> 04:24:04,980
If chicken Ron could do it, we can do it.

3790
04:24:05,120 --> 04:24:05,720
We can do it too.

3791
04:24:06,300 --> 04:24:07,960

I have an artillery strike.

3829
04:27:47,820 --> 04:27:48,520
We could destroy the house.

Yeah, I'm not along the way.

4017
04:36:09,710 --> 04:36:10,130
Oh, shit.

4018
04:36:10,350 --> 04:36:10,870
Oh, my God.

4019
04:36:11,030 --> 04:36:12,350
He was also looking at me.

4020
04:36:12,630 --> 04:36:12,950
Oh,

4021
04:36:16,320 --> 04:36:16,640
it's OK.

4022
04:36:16,780 --> 04:36:17,040
It's OK.

4023
04:36:18,480 --> 04:36:18,820
I believe.

4024
04:36:20,520 --> 04:36:21,080
Oh, my God.

4025
04:36:23,860 --> 04:36:24,520
It's OK.

4026
04:36:28,670 --> 04:36:29,070
I believe.

4027
04:36:29,270 --> 04:36:31,010
I can't even lose with this ping.

4028
04:36:31,170 --> 04:36:31,590
You're right.

4029
04:36:32,330 --> 04:36:32,750
I believe.

4030
04:36:33,110 --> 04:36:34,130
Whoa, out there.

4031
04:36:34,450 --> 04:36:34,890

04:37:43,910 --> 04:37:44,510
They actually strike.

4037
04:37:45,910 --> 04:37:46,430
Nice.

4038
04:37:50,700 --> 04:37:53,500

I've got a shotgun with these people's names on it.

4041
04:38:01,380 --> 04:38:01,720
What?

4042
04:38:02,420 --> 04:38:03,940
Oh my god, maybe there's a gun here.

4043
04:38:04,480 --> 04:38:06,340
Maybe they put a gun in the security.

4044
04:38:06,680 --> 04:38:07,840
Loki, armory crate.

4045
04:38:08,700 --> 04:38:08,940
Okay.

4046
04:38:09,580 --> 04:38:10,100
Oh, you're far.

4047
04:38:10,220 --> 04:38:10,940
No, I'm far.

4048
04:38:11,040 --> 04:38:11,720
I'm far far.

4049
04:38:12,360 --> 04:38:16,000
I'm hoping that, you know, they'll happen to drop one tiny gun.

4050
04:38:16,080 --> 04:38:17,380
You'll leave a tiny gun for me.

4051
04:38:17,460 --> 04:38:18,320
Oh, no, no gun.

4052
04:38:18,780 --> 04:38:19,320
It's okay.

4053
04:38:19,800 --> 04:38:19,840
Just.

4054
04:38:20,720 --> 04:38:21,280
Oh, they did.

4055
04:38:21,340 --> 04:38:21,740
They left a gun.

4056
04:38:22,180 --> 04:38:23,860
They left a gun.

4057
04:38:24,220 --> 04:38:24,720
Thank God.

4058
04:38:25,340 --> 04:38:26,260
I got a gun, guys.

4059
04:38:26,500 --> 04:38:27,340
Oh, oh, they read the play.

4060
04:38:27,460 --> 04:38:27,800
They read the play.

4061
04:38:27,940 --> 04:38:28,300
They read the play.

4062
04:38:29,420 --> 04:38:29,600
Okay.

4063
04:38:31,800 --> 04:38:33,160
I got a crossing, bro.

4064
04:38:33,800 --> 04:38:34,460
I'm dead.

4065
04:38:34,880 --> 04:38:34,920
Hello.

4066
04:38:35,660 --> 04:38:36,380
Wait, where?

4067
04:38:36,820 --> 04:38:38,560
Are you fucking prone, please?

4068
04:38:38,820 --> 04:38:39,320
Holy shit.

4069
04:38:41,780 --> 04:38:42,880
Wait, they're fighting.

4070
04:38:43,320 --> 04:38:43,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4071
04:38:45,300 --> 04:38:46,020
Oh, shit.

4072
04:38:46,260 --> 04:38:47,140
Okay, let's get him.

4073
04:38:48,140 --> 04:38:49,300
Oh, I see him.

4074
04:38:49,380 --> 04:38:49,820
He's over there.

4075
04:38:50,260 --> 04:38:51,460
I do also have a shotgun.

4076
04:38:53,220 --> 04:38:53,620
Jesus.

4077
04:38:54,380 --> 04:38:54,980
One down.

4078
04:38:55,700 --> 04:38:56,000
Nice.

4079
04:39:00,270 --> 04:39:01,390
Oh, hey, Winfield.

4080
04:39:02,550 --> 04:39:05,730
It's just so miserable to control.

4081
04:39:07,010 --> 04:39:07,410
Oh, he's out!

4082
04:39:08,370 --> 04:39:08,870
Oh, no.

4083
04:39:09,530 --> 04:39:10,270
Last two, last two.

4084
04:39:12,810 --> 04:39:13,590
I'm dead.

4085
04:39:15,110 --> 04:39:16,490
You got this?

4086
04:39:16,890 --> 04:39:17,010
Whoa.

4087
04:39:20,290 --> 04:39:20,970
Where did he go?

4088
04:39:22,170 --> 04:39:22,730
Oh shit!

4089
04:39:23,970 --> 04:39:24,810
That's where he went.

4090
04:39:26,410 --> 04:39:27,590
Oh, nice spot, nice spot.

4091
04:39:27,870 --> 04:39:28,590
Nice, good.

4092
04:39:28,950 --> 04:39:29,310
Yeah.

4093
04:39:29,770 --> 04:39:32,230
I think you're clipping through, but...

4094
04:39:32,230 --> 04:39:33,210
Whoa, no!

4095
04:39:33,370 --> 04:39:34,410
Was I clipping through?

4096
04:39:35,070 --> 04:39:36,530
Was I clipping through?

4097
04:39:36,970 --> 04:39:38,550
I think your arm is clipping through.

4098
04:39:39,270 --> 04:39:39,870
No!

4099
04:39:43,570 --> 04:39:45,370
All right, we got to kick Doki now.

4100
04:39:45,530 --> 04:39:46,130
It's her turn.

4101
04:39:48,090 --> 04:39:49,730
I was the one that died first, though.

4102
04:39:49,930 --> 04:39:51,450
I wasn't the one that died first.

4103
04:39:51,630 --> 04:39:53,550
You guys can't blame that on me.

4104
04:39:56,030 --> 04:39:56,490
Guys, oh my god.

4105
04:39:56,670 --> 04:39:58,490
There was still another squad there.

4106
04:39:58,710 --> 04:39:59,370
There was still...

4107
04:39:59,370 --> 04:40:01,190
Jesus, why were they all here?

4108
04:40:02,270 --> 04:40:03,290
Crazy, wow.

4109
04:40:04,530 --> 04:40:09,070
It's so painful when you try to loot and it takes forever, dude.

4110
04:40:09,650 --> 04:40:10,110
Holy shit.

4111
04:40:12,450 --> 04:40:16,850
where like my character just beating the shit out back again.

4112
04:40:16,890 --> 04:40:17,370
No.

4113
04:40:18,710 --> 04:40:20,830
First we'll smack it, then we'll jerk it.

4114
04:40:20,870 --> 04:40:21,350
No.

4115
04:40:21,430 --> 04:40:22,410
It's actually crazy.

4116
04:40:22,850 --> 04:40:23,390
Wait, what?

4117
04:40:24,270 --> 04:40:25,230
Axel's gonna do that.

4118
04:40:25,230 --> 04:40:26,510
Wait, do you like take turns?

4119
04:40:27,350 --> 04:40:32,290
Like, like Axel, who's the, who's the swacking, who's the other one?

4120
04:40:33,590 --> 04:40:35,710
I'm the whacker, he's the.

4121
04:40:36,090 --> 04:40:36,450
Yeah.

4122
04:40:36,970 --> 04:40:38,250
Oh, Axel, are you the other guy?

4123
04:40:39,490 --> 04:40:41,690
What the fuck are you guys talking about, yo?

4124
04:40:41,810 --> 04:40:42,230
That's a yes.

4125
04:40:42,450 --> 04:40:44,450
Okay, Winfield was like...

4126
04:40:45,490 --> 04:40:49,510
The Winfield's like, he give him a sniper and we win this.

4127
04:40:51,130 --> 04:40:51,650
Okay.

4128
04:40:52,530 --> 04:40:55,250
Alright, we give him a sniper and we win this.

4129
04:40:55,830 --> 04:40:58,970
If Winfield doesn't win here, I'm gonna assume that he's jorking it.

4130
04:40:59,090 --> 04:40:59,450
Yeah.

4131
04:41:00,790 --> 04:41:01,790
Also, what else did he say?

4132
04:41:02,910 --> 04:41:03,990
He said something else.

4133
04:41:06,170 --> 04:41:06,730
Oh, wait.

4134
04:41:07,430 --> 04:41:07,950
The...

4135
04:41:07,950 --> 04:41:11,610
Dude, you gotta blank someplace else, not this game.

4136
04:41:12,670 --> 04:41:14,070
What does that mean?

4137
04:41:15,410 --> 04:41:16,590
What does that mean?

4138
04:41:17,370 --> 04:41:18,810
What is he trying to say?

4139
04:41:26,300 --> 04:41:28,840
I don't even understand what he's trying to say.

4140
04:41:30,980 --> 04:41:36,580
They couldn't, like, put some kind of realism in this by saying, survive the collapsing wall of wildfire.

4141
04:41:36,780 --> 04:41:38,000
It's just a collapsing wall of death.

4142
04:41:38,700 --> 04:41:38,960
All right.

4143
04:41:41,160 --> 04:41:41,820
Come on, realism.

4144
04:41:41,960 --> 04:41:42,940
Where's my wildfires?

4145
04:41:43,340 --> 04:41:44,100
Where's my bushfires?

4146
04:41:45,040 --> 04:41:45,940
What's your bushfires?

4147
04:41:46,020 --> 04:41:47,580
There's so many bushfires here.

4148
04:41:47,660 --> 04:41:57,940

4151
04:42:52,180 --> 04:42:53,580
See, that's a good question.

4152
04:42:53,720 --> 04:42:54,560
I don't even know.

4153
04:42:55,080 --> 04:42:55,900
Maybe Gold Coast?

4154
04:42:56,140 --> 04:42:57,580
Gold Coast seems pretty good.

4155
04:42:58,060 --> 04:42:58,500
Gold Coast?

4156
04:42:59,380 --> 04:43:00,880
Yeah, Gold Coast is alright.

4157
04:43:01,200 --> 04:43:01,740
It's not bad.

4158
04:43:02,440 --> 04:43:03,200
Alright, where do we go?

4159
04:43:03,460 --> 04:43:04,360
Are we trying again?

4160
04:43:04,640 --> 04:43:06,520
Alright, oh wait, I think that's the century this time.

4161
04:43:06,760 --> 04:43:08,500
I think it's the century this time, guys.

4162
04:43:11,640 --> 04:43:12,540
It'll work, guys.

4163
04:43:12,840 --> 04:43:13,500
Trust me, it'll work.

4164
04:43:16,260 --> 04:43:17,140
I believe...

4165
04:43:17,140 --> 04:43:19,220
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna fucking...

4166
04:43:19,600 --> 04:43:20,800
In my head.

4167
04:43:23,200 --> 04:43:25,600
Other people on the left side.

4168
04:43:26,040 --> 04:43:27,100
Alright, I'm going to the right.

4169
04:43:32,480 --> 04:43:35,200
I'm gonna try and find a gun.

4170
04:43:35,640 --> 04:43:36,620
One little gun.

4171
04:43:36,800 --> 04:43:38,380
That's all I asked for.

4172
04:43:39,860 --> 04:43:40,720
One gun, please.

4173
04:43:40,840 --> 04:43:42,480
One gun, baby, please.

4174
04:43:43,820 --> 04:43:44,340
Yay!

4175
04:43:45,200 --> 04:43:45,800
Nice.

4176
04:43:46,520 --> 04:43:47,200
I got a gun.

4177
04:43:47,820 --> 04:43:48,780
Oh, he's dead, dead.

4178
04:43:49,980 --> 04:43:51,260
Yeah, you got D-Willy.

4179
04:43:52,820 --> 04:43:54,120
And Machoke that hoe.

4180
04:43:56,620 --> 04:43:57,580
Do I hear someone?

4181
04:43:58,360 --> 04:43:58,760
You do?

4182
04:43:59,060 --> 04:44:00,020
I use UAV.

4183
04:44:01,360 --> 04:44:02,780
I don't hear anybody.

4184
04:44:03,720 --> 04:44:05,320
Oh, there is someone above us.

4185
04:44:07,760 --> 04:44:08,720
Are you kidding me?

4186
04:44:08,900 --> 04:44:09,540
My gun did.

4187
04:44:10,860 --> 04:44:11,720
They're above there.

4188
04:44:12,760 --> 04:44:13,040
Yep.

4189
04:44:14,880 --> 04:44:16,040
I see them.

4190
04:44:16,140 --> 04:44:16,780
They're on the second floor.

4191
04:44:16,840 --> 04:44:17,460
They're on the second floor.

4192
04:44:17,680 --> 04:44:18,640
Or the third floor.

4193
04:44:19,600 --> 04:44:21,600
They're right here in that room.

4194
04:44:22,520 --> 04:44:22,920
Great.

4195
04:44:24,120 --> 04:44:25,360
One right there.

4196
04:44:25,620 --> 04:44:26,860
I'm going up.

4197
04:44:26,980 --> 04:44:27,240
On ping.

4198
04:44:28,280 --> 04:44:29,000
Gun up as well.

4199
04:44:30,100 --> 04:44:31,360
I think they ran across.

4200
04:44:32,740 --> 04:44:33,200
They ran across.

4201
04:44:35,800 --> 04:44:37,100
They shot through you.

4202
04:44:37,140 --> 04:44:38,580
They shot through you to kill me.

4203
04:44:39,420 --> 04:44:40,560
I just can't win.

4204
04:44:40,760 --> 04:44:41,800
Like, it's just impossible.

4205
04:44:44,220 --> 04:44:44,480
Thank you.

4206
04:44:44,480 --> 04:44:45,420
I might need help.

4207
04:44:45,900 --> 04:44:46,340
I might need cover.

4208
04:44:46,740 --> 04:44:47,800

4209
04:44:47,800 --> 04:44:48,400

I'm going back in.

4225
04:48:11,060 --> 04:48:12,520
I'm going back to a defense nexus.

4226
04:48:17,300 --> 04:48:18,500
Nice kill.

4227
04:48:20,120 --> 04:48:21,860
Fuck you, talk sucker.

4228
04:48:22,340 --> 04:48:23,340
That's fucking right.

04:48:25,020 --> 04:48:28,100
Oh, they got the res.

04:48:29,040 --> 04:48:29,620
Ah, shit.

4231
04:48:31,020 --> 04:48:32,680
Where's the next closest res?

4232
04:48:34,820 --> 04:48:35,920
I'm going to go to the other redeploy.

4233
04:48:36,180 --> 04:48:37,920
I'm going to the other redeploy right now.

4234
04:48:38,160 --> 04:48:40,460
Oh, everything's been drained.

4235
04:48:42,120 --> 04:48:43,280

04:48:46,850 --> 04:48:48,990
Okay, I'll meet up with you then.

4237
04:48:51,590 --> 04:48:52,470
You don't know.

4238
04:48:54,410 --> 04:48:54,890
They don't know.

4239
04:48:54,970 --> 04:48:55,890
I'm at the next one.

4240
04:48:59,130 --> 04:48:59,850
Redeploy them.

4241
04:49:00,810 --> 04:49:01,990
They don't know.

4242
04:49:02,710 --> 04:49:05,570
Remember that little, the little sneaky little tunnel you were in earlier?

4243
04:49:08,230 --> 04:49:09,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4244
04:49:09,590 --> 04:49:10,330

They didn't see me perish.

There we go.

04:51:24,930 --> 04:51:25,790
I got this, guys.

4258
04:51:29,390 --> 04:51:30,630
Do we die?

4259
04:51:30,810 --> 04:51:31,630
We get hit by that?

4260
04:51:32,430 --> 04:51:33,110
I think so.

4261
04:51:33,470 --> 04:51:34,090
No, we're five.

4262
04:51:34,510 --> 04:51:34,850
Nice!

4263
04:51:35,070 --> 04:51:36,330
We got an airdrop, too.

4264
04:51:37,890 --> 04:51:39,110
Wait, there is a team coming in.

4265
04:51:39,250 --> 04:51:40,150
Is that the red thing?

4266
04:51:41,430 --> 04:51:42,510
Airdrop rewards coming in.

4267
04:51:43,090 --> 04:51:43,370
Alright.

4268
04:51:44,030 --> 04:51:45,550
Let's go grab that outside.

4269
04:51:45,850 --> 04:51:46,250
Let's go.

4270
04:51:46,470 --> 04:51:46,770
Alright.

4271
04:51:51,440 --> 04:51:51,880
What?

4272
04:51:54,400 --> 04:51:54,620
Excellent.

4273
04:51:56,840 --> 04:51:57,540
It's okay.

4274
04:51:59,000 --> 04:52:01,740
I would like it.

4275
04:52:02,000 --> 04:52:02,960
There's a car over there.

4276
04:52:04,020 --> 04:52:05,760
I like this gun, please.

4277
04:52:06,560 --> 04:52:07,140
I don't know if it's good.

4278
04:52:07,140 --> 04:52:09,340
We can go get a custom weapon over there if you want to.

4279
04:52:10,480 --> 04:52:10,560
Ooh.

4280
04:52:11,320 --> 04:52:13,400
We want to move in a zone anyways.

4281
04:52:14,200 --> 04:52:19,020
I feel like every time we go for those random ones that just drop, there's always like three people looking at it.

4282
04:52:19,520 --> 04:52:19,920
Yeah.

4283
04:52:21,860 --> 04:52:24,000
You could do another mission and then get a free one.

4284
04:52:24,140 --> 04:52:26,560
I got, I heard shots next to me.

4285
04:52:26,880 --> 04:52:27,260
Okay.

4286
04:52:27,360 --> 04:52:28,240
I need to look for Alma.

4287
04:52:28,420 --> 04:52:28,840
I need to wait.

4288
04:52:29,120 --> 04:52:30,060
There's a car right behind us too.

4289
04:52:30,160 --> 04:52:30,800
Oh, my legs.

4290
04:52:32,860 --> 04:52:34,020
Oh, I picked the worst gun.

4291
04:52:34,660 --> 04:52:37,180
Oh, I didn't know what gun to pick.

4292
04:52:39,380 --> 04:52:41,400
I thought I didn't know.

4293
04:52:41,580 --> 04:52:42,620
That's me shooting my gun.

4294
04:52:43,180 --> 04:52:47,420
So I was like, I was like, is it really the worst gun?

4295
04:52:47,580 --> 04:52:49,040
Don't say that, guys.

4296
04:52:49,940 --> 04:53:29,240
it's the best gun it's in it's in her hands it's a safe oh what's that i think i just got real gunned oh people behind us behind us ping ping ping ping shooting from up the hill fuck you guys ping i don't know oh no i got tanked oh you got tanked okay we got oh god okay i'm going i'm leaving i'm leaving oh i'm gonna shot it now all right i'm gonna i'm running i'm running to the closest redeploy i see it i see it it's to my left i'm heading there right now thank you all i'm saying oh you're oh you're fine okay never mind somehow i'll grab this

4298
04:53:49,970 --> 04:53:53,790
I'm trying to look for like a RPG or something that can destroy a tank, but...

4299
04:53:54,770 --> 04:53:56,570
I don't think that's possible, guys.

4300
04:53:56,790 --> 04:53:57,490
There's nothing...

4301
04:53:57,490 --> 04:53:58,470
Wait, there's a custom weapon here.

4302
04:53:59,790 --> 04:54:01,210
Yeah, but I don't think we can get it.

4303
04:54:01,250 --> 04:54:02,830
I think the tank is going to look from above.

4304
04:54:03,250 --> 04:54:04,030
No, no, no, no.

4305
04:54:04,250 --> 04:54:04,530
It's fine.

4306
04:54:04,670 --> 04:54:06,710
I'm literally at it right now.

4307
04:54:07,010 --> 04:54:07,970
Alright, guys, which one's better?

4308
04:54:08,630 --> 04:54:11,030
Guys, tell me what weapon to get, and then I'll get it right now.

4309
04:54:11,350 --> 04:54:12,290
Guys, guys, come on.

4310
04:54:12,430 --> 04:54:13,070
Tell me which one.

4312
04:54:14,070 --> 04:54:14,470
At chat.

4313
04:54:14,570 --> 04:54:14,970
At chat.

4314
04:54:15,530 --> 04:54:16,150
At chat.

4315
04:54:16,350 --> 04:54:16,670
At chat.

4316
04:54:16,770 --> 04:54:17,590
I can't stand still.

4317
04:54:21,150 --> 04:54:22,770
I'm still getting sniped at.

4318
04:54:22,930 --> 04:54:23,730
Which one's the SMG?

4319
04:54:23,870 --> 04:54:25,110
I can't tell.

4320
04:54:25,610 --> 04:54:25,930
MG?

4321
04:54:27,850 --> 04:54:28,350
I'm still MG.

4322
04:54:28,610 --> 04:54:29,390
Which one is it?

4323
04:54:30,070 --> 04:54:30,510
M433?

4324
04:54:30,950 --> 04:54:32,550
The one on the very left, I think.

4325
04:54:34,890 --> 04:54:35,670
Which one?

4326
04:54:35,810 --> 04:54:36,430
I need some shields.

4327
04:54:36,670 --> 04:54:37,810
One, two, three, four!

4328
04:54:38,630 --> 04:54:39,070
SGX?

4329
04:54:39,090 --> 04:54:40,010
I declare it on more!

4330
04:54:40,250 --> 04:54:41,290
Okay, SGX there.

4331
04:54:41,310 --> 04:54:41,730
Yeah, give me shield.

4332
04:54:41,990 --> 04:54:42,670
He'll take this.

4333
04:54:43,270 --> 04:54:44,010
Thank you, Axel.

4334
04:54:44,970 --> 04:54:46,730
See, that's an investment right there.

4335
04:54:48,210 --> 04:55:20,330
all right we're good see you guys i didn't panic at all all right i think we should go to here people are here south south here we got a ride over here this world's a scary place i'm heading straight to this here right here okay i'm heading here that looks like the center this is our next home I missed my corner.

4336
04:55:20,730 --> 04:55:21,410
It's her next home.

4337
04:55:21,590 --> 04:55:22,510
I missed her bathroom.

4338
04:55:23,750 --> 04:55:25,930
Oh, the bathroom is so lit until it was lit.

4339
04:55:26,250 --> 04:55:31,110
Yeah, so someone decided to break our only cover area.

4340
04:55:33,750 --> 04:55:35,110
Actually, I feel like maybe...

4341
04:55:35,110 --> 04:55:35,850
Can't believe you do that, Axel.

4342
04:55:36,090 --> 04:55:36,510
Come on.

4343
04:55:36,630 --> 04:55:37,750
Yeah, that's fucked, bro.

4344
04:55:38,690 --> 04:55:40,110
That's Ashley fucked.

4345
04:55:40,850 --> 04:55:41,350
Yeah, my shit.

4346
04:55:42,330 --> 04:55:43,290
There's someone on the roof?

4347
04:55:43,870 --> 04:55:44,050
Yeah.

4348
04:55:44,410 --> 04:55:45,890
Okay, there's someone on the roof.

4349
04:55:46,050 --> 04:55:47,790
Then I feel like maybe we should just stay in this house.

4350
04:55:48,030 --> 04:56:19,170
then rotate slowly in we're gonna stay here okay and then just like follow the zone although this is our new home now okay but what if you think people know I'm here you think you think this guys is this is this is this can you see me from here your legs clipping out yeah on kind of like this Oh,

4351
04:56:19,290 --> 04:56:19,690
that's perfect.

4352
04:56:19,930 --> 04:56:20,290
Yeah, yeah.

4353
04:56:20,710 --> 04:56:20,770
That's perfect.

4354
04:56:20,770 --> 04:56:21,150
That's perfect.

4355
04:56:23,150 --> 04:56:23,830
No one will know.

4356
04:56:24,310 --> 04:56:26,210
No one will know that I'm in here.

4357
04:56:26,550 --> 04:56:27,430
No one will know.

4358
04:56:30,190 --> 04:56:31,210
Well, look at the steam.

4359
04:56:31,330 --> 04:56:31,890
It's a hot tub.

4360
04:56:32,150 --> 04:56:32,990
Yeah, it's a hot tub.

4361
04:56:33,030 --> 04:56:33,950
Ooh, it's a steamy.

4362
04:56:33,950 --> 04:56:34,490
Yeah, it's your hot tub stream.

4363
04:56:34,870 --> 04:56:36,690
Yeah, it's your hot tub stream.

4364
04:56:36,910 --> 04:56:38,750
Oh, I actually closed the door.

4365
04:56:39,490 --> 04:56:39,670
Okay.

4366
04:56:40,550 --> 04:56:41,290
We're not in the zone.

4367
04:56:41,410 --> 04:56:47,130
Okay, someone, someone fucking shot the window so they know we're here.

4368
04:56:48,310 --> 04:56:51,210
Oh, there's a team in that house anyway.

4369
04:56:52,270 --> 04:56:52,510
Boy.

4370
04:56:54,210 --> 04:56:56,690
Oh, there's someone resting right behind us.

4371
04:56:58,030 --> 04:56:58,930
You guys want to just follow the zone?

4372
04:56:59,150 --> 04:56:59,810
Oh, they're going to kill them.

4373
04:57:00,210 --> 04:57:00,570
We could.

4374
04:57:00,910 --> 04:57:01,290
We could.

4375
04:57:02,010 --> 04:57:03,130
Oh, the tank is there.

4376
04:57:03,170 --> 04:57:03,950
Okay, we got to be quiet.

4377
04:57:04,050 --> 04:57:04,650
We got to be very quiet.

4378
04:57:04,830 --> 04:57:05,030
There's a tank.

4379
04:57:05,090 --> 04:57:05,510
No tank.

4380
04:57:05,670 --> 04:57:05,910
No tank.

4381
04:57:06,070 --> 04:57:08,290
We got to wait until the tank, like, leave us.

4382
04:57:10,930 --> 04:57:13,930
I'm going to, I'm just going to wait until the tank, like, passes us.

4383
04:57:14,650 --> 04:57:15,350
I don't trust it.

4384
04:57:15,470 --> 04:57:16,130
Do, do, do, do, do.

4385
04:57:18,450 --> 04:57:20,010
I am a snail.

4386
04:57:20,970 --> 04:57:22,270
We are calm people.

4387
04:57:22,590 --> 04:57:23,130
Oh, oh, someone.

4388
04:57:23,330 --> 04:57:24,350
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

4389
04:57:24,530 --> 04:57:26,190
Wait, someone sent an artillery strike on the tank.

4390
04:57:27,890 --> 04:57:29,930
Someone sent two artillery.

4391
04:57:30,230 --> 04:57:30,650
Whoa!

4392
04:57:32,630 --> 04:57:33,770
Oh my goodness.

4393
04:57:36,130 --> 04:57:36,990
Goodbye, tank.

4394
04:57:38,110 --> 04:57:38,610
I guess.

4395
04:57:40,290 --> 04:57:41,150
We go left or right.

4396
04:57:41,910 --> 04:57:43,530
They just want to go left or right.

4397
04:57:44,250 --> 04:57:45,250
I know there's people to our right.

4398
04:57:46,810 --> 04:57:47,310
What?

4399
04:57:48,030 --> 04:57:48,830
There's people on our left.

4400
04:57:49,170 --> 04:57:50,430
Like, there's like three people on our left.

4401
04:57:50,690 --> 04:57:51,410
Oh, 175?

4402
04:57:52,130 --> 04:57:52,770
I think we go right.

4403
04:57:53,230 --> 04:57:53,870
We go from the right.

4404
04:57:53,930 --> 04:57:54,410
Right, OK.

4405
04:57:55,250 --> 04:57:57,970
We can't really go right now.

4406
04:57:58,390 --> 04:57:58,750
Yes.

4407
04:57:58,950 --> 04:57:59,490
There's people on our left.

4408
04:57:59,830 --> 04:58:01,130
There's people shooting all the way.

4409
04:58:01,170 --> 04:58:01,810
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4410
04:58:02,170 --> 04:58:03,170
Oh, okay.

4411
04:58:03,350 --> 04:58:03,570
That's fine.

4412
04:58:04,090 --> 04:58:05,730
Oh, what happened?

4413
04:58:06,310 --> 04:58:06,790
I didn't smoke.

4414
04:58:06,950 --> 04:58:07,130
I smoked.

4415
04:58:07,830 --> 04:58:07,850
I smoked.

4416
04:58:08,890 --> 04:58:09,190
I smoked.

4417
04:58:10,490 --> 04:58:11,310
Go over here.

4418
04:58:11,990 --> 04:58:12,490
I smoked it.

4419
04:58:12,830 --> 04:58:13,590
Oh, no.

4420
04:58:16,470 --> 04:58:17,070
Squats dead.

4421
04:58:17,390 --> 04:58:17,750
Sorry, Axel.

4422
04:58:17,850 --> 04:58:17,930
Okay.

4423
04:58:20,030 --> 04:58:22,990
I just can't win in a fight.

4424
04:58:23,170 --> 04:58:24,030
It's just...

4425
04:58:26,310 --> 04:58:27,190
All right, we...

4426
04:58:27,190 --> 04:58:27,970
Can we redeploy?

4427
04:58:29,130 --> 04:58:30,850
Do we have a closer deploy to...

4428
04:58:30,850 --> 04:58:32,890
It's like over here, but I don't know.

4429
04:58:33,130 --> 04:58:34,870
Okay, we have to figure out right or left, though.

4430
04:58:36,990 --> 04:58:37,430
Um...

4431
04:58:37,430 --> 04:58:38,530
I would...

4432
04:58:39,730 --> 04:58:41,790
Because there is a team right in that house.

4433
04:58:44,630 --> 04:58:46,410
There's a team on the right side.

4434
04:58:46,530 --> 04:58:48,010
I saw them running from those areas.

4435
04:58:48,030 --> 04:58:49,230
So maybe it's them.

4436
04:58:49,250 --> 04:58:50,410
So I don't want to go right side.

4437
04:58:50,510 --> 04:58:51,310
I'm gonna follow Winfield.

4438
04:58:51,710 --> 04:59:03,890
He ran already I Need more shields There is a card who are left Just a ripe for the taking.

4439
04:59:04,070 --> 04:59:05,590
Oh, wait, wait, Winfield smart wouldn't feel smart.

4440
04:59:05,870 --> 04:59:09,010

Oh, how do you get up there?

4445
04:59:23,180 --> 04:59:24,260
Behind us is safe.

4446
04:59:24,320 --> 04:59:25,380
We're good.

4447
04:59:26,000 --> 04:59:26,520

Did they have any shields?

4462
04:59:48,480 --> 04:59:48,700

05:00:24,240 --> 05:00:26,040
All right, I guess we slowly rotate.

4465
05:00:28,140 --> 05:00:28,940
Our life.

4466
05:00:29,100 --> 05:00:29,460

Oh, my God.

Look at the end zone.

4470
05:00:32,160 --> 05:00:34,060
End zone is like the open field.

4471
05:00:34,440 --> 05:00:34,500
Okay.

Let's try to get some trees for cover then.

4474
05:00:42,580 --> 05:00:44,800
I think all we could do is just...

4475
05:00:44,800 --> 05:00:46,900
We just have to rotate last, I guess.

4476
05:00:48,060 --> 05:00:48,320
Yep.

4477
05:00:49,200 --> 05:00:49,860
Five squads left.

4478
05:00:49,920 --> 05:00:50,660

You're right.

4484
05:01:23,540 --> 05:01:24,200
It should be fine.

4485
05:01:24,640 --> 05:01:27,020
Unless there's another person right behind us.

4486
05:01:29,300 --> 05:01:30,480
Oh, the fires.

4487
05:01:31,140 --> 05:01:31,340
Oh!

4488
05:01:31,720 --> 05:01:32,080
Artillery!

4489
05:01:32,480 --> 05:01:33,260
How did they know?

4490
05:01:33,680 --> 05:01:35,000
That's a...

4491
05:01:35,000 --> 05:01:35,460
Oh, yeah.

4492
05:01:35,720 --> 05:01:36,560
I took a big hit.

4493
05:01:36,800 --> 05:01:37,380
I took a big hit.

4494
05:01:37,660 --> 05:01:39,780
I don't know how they knew we were there, but...

4495
05:01:41,240 --> 05:01:42,900
Oh, that's people over there as well.

4496
05:01:42,960 --> 05:01:43,680
They just crashed on it.

4497
05:01:43,860 --> 05:01:44,420
They just crashed on it.

4498
05:01:44,480 --> 05:01:44,720
Oh, my God.

4499
05:01:44,860 --> 05:01:45,040
Oh.

4500
05:01:46,400 --> 05:01:47,780
I don't know if I'm gonna get...

4501
05:01:47,780 --> 05:01:49,120
I think I feel like I'm gonna get strike there.

4502
05:01:53,280 --> 05:01:54,000
Good luck.

4503
05:01:54,420 --> 05:01:54,740
I know.

4504
05:01:56,120 --> 05:01:57,260
I don't know if I...

4505
05:01:59,200 --> 05:02:01,100
Windfield's playing it very safely.

4506
05:02:07,610 --> 05:02:08,610
I also have smokes.

4507
05:02:09,870 --> 05:02:10,950
That was so unlucky.

4508
05:02:11,670 --> 05:02:13,710
One far north, far northwest.

4509
05:02:15,230 --> 05:02:16,090
That's a single, I think.

4510
05:02:16,490 --> 05:02:16,810
Okay.

4511
05:02:17,510 --> 05:02:20,570
There's a full squad to our...

4512
05:02:20,570 --> 05:02:22,890
There's actually a full squad to our left.

4513
05:02:23,730 --> 05:02:25,230
You won't be safe there for long.

4514
05:02:26,170 --> 05:02:30,930
Yep, I could feel it Super far northwest though

4515
05:02:36,310 --> 05:02:37,890
Oh, there they are.

4516
05:02:38,670 --> 05:02:39,850

Oh, Winfield's hiding there.

4654
05:18:31,670 --> 05:18:32,250
He's done.

4655

Oh, my.

4657
05:18:34,050 --> 05:18:38,270
He's like, I did not sign up for this, for this long of a session.

4658
05:18:38,730 --> 05:18:41,650
I think he thought we would have won a game like three hours ago.

4659
05:18:41,730 --> 05:18:42,610
Sorry, Winfield.

4660
05:18:44,330 --> 05:18:45,170
We're trying, I swear.

4661
05:18:46,050 --> 05:18:46,710
I'm hanging over.

4662
05:18:47,230 --> 05:18:48,670

05:18:50,210 --> 05:18:51,450

05:18:52,410 --> 05:18:54,010
Or am I not trying?

4665
05:18:54,330 --> 05:18:54,490
Hmm.

4666
05:18:54,610 --> 05:18:57,270
Winfield, we need you to use more than 10% of your power.

4667
05:18:57,630 --> 05:18:59,990
Winfield, I need you to kill half the lobby.

4668
05:19:00,630 --> 05:19:02,910
Winfield, I need you to get me a pizza.

4669
05:19:03,650 --> 05:19:04,930
All right, he has an enemy near him.

4670
05:19:05,050 --> 05:19:06,670
I'm going to be on the house next to him.

4671
05:19:07,090 --> 05:19:07,950
Helicopter, helicopter, helicopter.

4672
05:19:08,330 --> 05:19:09,130

Okay.

4676
05:19:14,730 --> 05:19:16,890

4677
05:19:17,250 --> 05:19:19,290
I'm going to the house that's next to him.

4678
05:19:20,470 --> 05:19:22,030

4685
05:20:18,680 --> 05:20:19,080
Ooh.

4686
05:20:21,220 --> 05:20:21,660
SMGG.

4687
05:20:25,480 --> 05:20:25,920
Custom.

05:20:26,540 --> 05:20:28,720
All right, I'm heading over to your building.

4689
05:20:29,840 --> 05:20:31,400

05:20:34,180 --> 05:20:35,060

05:20:38,360 --> 05:20:38,600
Hello.

05:20:40,720 --> 05:20:41,540

05:20:43,640 --> 05:20:45,480
Oh, I can't.

4696
05:20:45,920 --> 05:20:47,100
I wanted to go in the park.

4697
05:20:47,620 --> 05:20:48,640
Oh, oh, no.

4698
05:20:48,980 --> 05:20:49,260

Do you think it's noticeable?

4714

Can they see me?

4715
05:21:39,700 --> 05:21:40,660
I can see your backpack.

4716
05:21:41,560 --> 05:21:42,080

4717
05:21:42,760 --> 05:21:42,980

Perfect.

4723
05:21:50,420 --> 05:21:51,560
You go on the other side.

4724
05:21:51,800 --> 05:21:54,240
You do the same thing, but on the other side.

4725
05:21:54,960 --> 05:21:55,320
Okay.

4726
05:21:56,000 --> 05:21:56,580

There you go.

4728
05:21:57,220 --> 05:21:57,800
That's perfect.

4729
05:21:58,100 --> 05:21:58,420
Yeah!

4730
05:21:59,220 --> 05:22:01,060
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way to know.

4731
05:22:01,360 --> 05:22:02,300
Oh, we're not in zone.

4732
05:22:02,400 --> 05:22:03,340
You want an LMG, by the way?

4733
05:22:03,640 --> 05:22:03,960
No, I'm good.

4734
05:22:04,240 --> 05:22:05,040
Aren't you good at the LMG?

4735
05:22:05,300 --> 05:22:05,440
No, I'm good.

4736
05:22:06,620 --> 05:22:07,800
I don't know what gun I'm good.

4737
05:22:07,900 --> 05:22:08,140
I don't know.

4738
05:22:08,200 --> 05:22:08,820
I've still have yet.

4739
05:22:08,900 --> 05:22:11,580
We've been playing for five hours, and I've still yet to know which gun is good.

4740
05:22:12,800 --> 05:22:13,700
Oh, yeah, I can guess.

4741
05:22:16,260 --> 05:22:17,740
Oh, I don't see anybody.

4742
05:22:20,820 --> 05:22:22,920
I don't think we're in zone, guys.

4743
05:22:23,120 --> 05:22:26,340
I have a feeling that we should maybe go...

4744
05:22:26,340 --> 05:22:28,360
Someone super far over here.

4745
05:22:30,280 --> 05:22:32,800
Maybe we should go over here to one of those houses.

4746
05:22:33,180 --> 05:22:33,420
Winfield!

4747
05:22:33,880 --> 05:22:36,380
Go to one of those houses for us, and we'll meet you there.

4748
05:22:38,860 --> 05:22:39,620
On two?

4749
05:22:40,360 --> 05:22:42,940
Uh, there's people flying into two, so there's probably a fight going on there.

4750
05:22:43,120 --> 05:22:43,500
Oh, okay.

4751
05:22:44,400 --> 05:22:44,960
Then we'll go.

4752
05:22:45,500 --> 05:22:47,280
Uh, there's people on point three.

4753
05:22:48,340 --> 05:22:49,220
What about here?

4754
05:22:51,140 --> 05:22:51,520
Two.

4755
05:22:53,600 --> 05:22:54,980
Uh, could make it over there.

4756
05:22:55,300 --> 05:22:56,080
Yeah, we can make it.

4757
05:22:56,120 --> 05:22:57,160
Winfield, we're gonna go.

4758
05:22:58,600 --> 05:22:59,160
Let's go.

4759
05:22:59,240 --> 05:23:00,220
We're going to be on our mission.

4760
05:23:00,800 --> 05:23:01,400
There's a car.

4761
05:23:01,700 --> 05:23:02,480
We take that car.

4762
05:23:02,780 --> 05:23:04,900
We take that car and then like go to...

4763
05:23:04,900 --> 05:23:05,240
I'll win this.

4764
05:23:05,660 --> 05:23:06,200
Don't worry.

4765
05:23:06,320 --> 05:23:07,180
I miss Axel.

4766
05:23:08,180 --> 05:23:08,940
Can I win it?

4767
05:23:09,040 --> 05:23:09,340
Marty.

4768
05:23:09,860 --> 05:23:10,460
We're going to do this.

4769
05:23:10,520 --> 05:23:11,520
We're going to do this for you, Axel.

4770
05:23:11,700 --> 05:23:12,340
I'm going to take the car.

4771
05:23:12,920 --> 05:23:13,160
I'll take it.

4772
05:23:13,200 --> 05:23:13,900
Trust me on this.

4773
05:23:14,980 --> 05:23:16,420
What if we get two cars?

4774
05:23:17,040 --> 05:23:18,000
Okay, let's get two cars.

4775
05:23:21,920 --> 05:23:23,660
One of us is going to die.

4776
05:23:25,780 --> 05:23:27,300
Got a new mission for you.

4777
05:23:28,420 --> 05:23:30,600
Caltar hasn't seen me drift like this before.

4778
05:23:31,100 --> 05:23:32,220
Alright, I'm going in.

4779
05:23:32,860 --> 05:23:34,120
I'm going to scout for that house.

4780
05:23:40,490 --> 05:23:41,090
Sorry.

4781
05:23:44,510 --> 05:23:44,730
Beep.

4782
05:23:47,890 --> 05:23:48,410
Okay.

4783
05:23:50,970 --> 05:23:53,350
Wait, this is my favorite place.

4784
05:23:56,370 --> 05:23:58,650
Totally incantikuous, Humvee.

4785
05:23:59,510 --> 05:24:00,910
Wait, I know this place.

4786
05:24:02,030 --> 05:24:02,330
Oh.

4787
05:24:05,740 --> 05:24:07,500
You're right above me right now.

4788
05:24:14,640 --> 05:24:15,020
Um...

4789
05:24:15,020 --> 05:24:18,140
This is it.

4790
05:24:18,200 --> 05:24:18,600
This is it.

4791
05:24:18,780 --> 05:24:19,540
This is it.

4792
05:24:20,760 --> 05:24:22,260
Ah, I just made it on one piece.

4793
05:24:23,920 --> 05:24:25,840
You guys better win this one.

4794
05:24:26,080 --> 05:24:27,240
I believe in you guys.

4795
05:24:27,820 --> 05:24:29,600
There is a team on my... There is a team in my house.

4796
05:24:29,700 --> 05:24:31,000
There is a team in my house, Altair.

4797
05:24:31,380 --> 05:24:31,720
There is...

4798
05:24:34,900 --> 05:24:35,860
I'm taking this house.

4799
05:24:38,220 --> 05:24:38,700
Ooh.

4800
05:24:40,260 --> 05:24:41,780
It's a gas station.

4801
05:24:44,480 --> 05:24:47,040
I think I found the perfect place for myself.

4802
05:24:47,340 --> 05:24:47,780
It's okay, Axel.

4803
05:24:48,140 --> 05:24:49,320
We're doing this for you, Axel.

4804
05:24:49,540 --> 05:24:49,860
Don't worry.

4805
05:24:50,940 --> 05:24:51,240
Don't worry.

4806
05:24:51,420 --> 05:24:52,400
It's going to be so cool.

4807
05:24:52,480 --> 05:24:56,480
Loki, I can't go like five minutes without Axel or else I'll start breaking down.

4808
05:24:56,800 --> 05:24:58,400
There is a team right above us.

4809
05:24:58,760 --> 05:24:59,480
There is a team.

4810
05:25:00,340 --> 05:25:00,820
Shhh.

4811
05:25:01,060 --> 05:25:02,740
There is a team right above us.

4812
05:25:02,980 --> 05:25:03,320
So shh.

4813
05:25:03,380 --> 05:25:03,560

4814
05:25:03,640 --> 05:25:04,020
I'll go look.

4815
05:25:06,860 --> 05:25:08,100

4818
05:25:32,660 --> 05:25:32,960
We're fine.

4819
05:25:33,160 --> 05:25:33,260
We're fine.

4820
05:25:33,480 --> 05:25:34,160
Hey, can you let me in?

4821
05:25:34,340 --> 05:25:34,900
I'm at the door.

4822
05:25:35,940 --> 05:25:36,940
Can you let me in?

4823
05:25:37,540 --> 05:25:37,940
It's fine.

4824
05:25:38,120 --> 05:25:38,400
We're in.

4825
05:25:38,600 --> 05:25:42,220
We are so... Oh my... What if we're just in the middle of this ocean?

4826
05:25:46,180 --> 05:25:48,000
What if... Do you think they'll know?

4827
05:25:49,260 --> 05:25:50,000
I'm gonna do it.

4828
05:25:50,120 --> 05:25:51,840
I think there's... Everybody's north.

4829
05:25:52,020 --> 05:25:53,140
There's a lot of people north.

4830
05:25:55,280 --> 05:25:58,760
But like... What will happen if we're just in that middle of that ocean?

4831
05:25:59,060 --> 05:26:04,200
Like, like, will people look at the water?

4832
05:26:06,120 --> 05:26:07,660
Like, will people know?

4833
05:26:09,960 --> 05:26:10,880
Oh, there is a tank.

4834
05:26:11,560 --> 05:26:12,260
Will people know?

4835
05:26:12,380 --> 05:26:12,480
You see me?

4836
05:26:12,480 --> 05:26:13,360
We could try.

4837
05:26:13,740 --> 05:26:14,220
There's a boat.

4838
05:26:15,180 --> 05:26:15,820
We can get the boat.

4839
05:26:16,180 --> 05:26:18,320
I don't think we can get that boat.

4840
05:26:18,780 --> 05:26:21,200
I think it'd be more obvious like we used the boat.

4841
05:26:21,480 --> 05:26:22,340
We have to leave though.

4842
05:26:22,520 --> 05:26:23,180
We have to leave.

4843
05:26:23,420 --> 05:26:24,240
There's a tank out there.

4844
05:26:24,380 --> 05:26:24,840
Okay, let's go.

4845
05:26:25,020 --> 05:26:25,300
Let's go.

4846
05:26:25,680 --> 05:26:27,180
Okay, I think the, okay.

05:26:27,420 --> 05:26:28,160

4850
05:27:03,520 --> 05:27:07,980
I wonder, like, will they know if I start swimming in the water?

4851
05:27:09,260 --> 05:27:10,360
We'll cheer you on from here, okay?

4852
05:27:10,840 --> 05:27:11,480
You got this.

4853
05:27:11,780 --> 05:27:12,320
Is it noticeable?

4854
05:27:12,580 --> 05:27:13,320
When I'm in the water?

4855
05:27:15,280 --> 05:27:16,920
Is this dude right close to us?

4856
05:27:17,100 --> 05:27:17,440
Hold on.

4857
05:27:17,480 --> 05:27:18,060
But is it noticeable?

4858
05:27:18,060 --> 05:27:19,020
I can't see you from this angle.

4859
05:27:19,520 --> 05:27:21,980
Is it noticeable when I'm swimming in the water?

4860
05:27:22,500 --> 05:27:23,280
I don't see you.

4861
05:27:23,840 --> 05:27:24,120
Okay.

4862
05:27:24,320 --> 05:27:24,540
Okay.

4863
05:27:24,540 --> 05:27:24,860
Wait.

4864
05:27:24,980 --> 05:27:26,080
This trap might be it.

4865
05:27:30,000 --> 05:27:30,400
Okay.

4866
05:27:30,420 --> 05:27:32,740
Oh, I could kill someone.

4867
05:27:36,130 --> 05:27:36,970
I think they died.

4868
05:27:37,190 --> 05:27:38,010
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4869
05:27:38,010 --> 05:27:38,990
Oh my god, no!

4870
05:27:39,430 --> 05:27:39,570
No!

4871
05:27:39,810 --> 05:27:41,050
I am fucking gaming!

4872
05:27:41,510 --> 05:27:43,110
Where was I shot from?

4873
05:27:45,030 --> 05:27:47,750
Wait, where the fuck was I shot from?

4874
05:27:47,750 --> 05:27:49,590
Tank, tank, tank, tank.

4875
05:27:50,530 --> 05:27:50,810
No!

4876
05:27:52,170 --> 05:27:53,790
We could have seen that coming.

4877
05:27:54,150 --> 05:27:55,790
Who could have seen that?

4878
05:27:56,070 --> 05:27:57,510
Okay, guys.

4879
05:27:58,130 --> 05:28:01,770
So, apparently...

4880
05:28:02,550 --> 05:28:06,990
Apparently, there was a team at the bridge looking down at the water.

4881
05:28:07,430 --> 05:28:10,450
Oh, there was a team underneath that bridge when I sweat.

4882
05:28:10,530 --> 05:28:14,170
Because I was thinking, oh, I'll swim near the bridge area instead of the middle of the ocean.

4883
05:28:14,830 --> 05:28:16,430
That was the thing I fucked up on.

4884
05:28:16,530 --> 05:28:17,490
I should have just stayed in the middle.

4885
05:28:17,790 --> 05:28:19,110
Okay, I'll tear.

4886
05:28:19,810 --> 05:28:20,050
Yes.

4887
05:28:20,130 --> 05:28:21,250
You test out my secondary.

4888
05:28:22,210 --> 05:28:22,570
Okay.

4889
05:28:23,050 --> 05:28:23,430
The water?

4890
05:28:23,930 --> 05:28:25,650
No, no, don't do it.

4891
05:28:25,870 --> 05:28:27,850
I think we need you and one field alive.

4892
05:28:28,430 --> 05:28:28,470
Woo!

4893
05:28:30,030 --> 05:28:30,390
Yeah.

4894
05:28:31,790 --> 05:28:33,650
But this wind would be nothing without Axel.

4895
05:28:34,170 --> 05:28:34,730
Even if we win.

4896
05:28:34,950 --> 05:28:35,410
No, no, no.

4897
05:28:35,650 --> 05:28:37,530
Even if we win, he's, we'll be free.

4898
05:28:37,650 --> 05:28:38,270
He's fine.

4899
05:28:39,410 --> 05:28:41,490
No, we shouldn't do that for a reason.

4900
05:28:41,590 --> 05:28:41,770
There's a creep.

4901
05:28:42,550 --> 05:28:45,770
Oh, oh, they see Winfield.

4902
05:28:46,070 --> 05:28:47,250
Oh, wow, they're sniping us.

4903
05:28:47,630 --> 05:28:48,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4904
05:28:48,290 --> 05:28:50,250
You guys gotta go to...

4905
05:28:51,350 --> 05:28:52,530
You gotta follow Winfield.

4906
05:28:52,650 --> 05:28:53,730
You gotta follow him.

4907
05:28:55,030 --> 05:28:55,910
Following Winfield.

4908
05:28:57,990 --> 05:28:58,470
He's got...

4909
05:28:58,470 --> 05:28:59,550
He's figuring shit out.

4910
05:28:59,610 --> 05:29:00,310
He's cooking right now.

4911
05:29:00,350 --> 05:29:00,830
He's cooking.

4912
05:29:01,790 --> 05:29:03,970
There is, there are rats under that bridge.

4913
05:29:04,150 --> 05:29:05,750
There are rats under that bridge.

4914
05:29:05,970 --> 05:29:08,890
I repeat, that is where I died.

4915
05:29:12,790 --> 05:29:13,030
Whoa.

4916
05:29:14,790 --> 05:29:16,210
I think I see them.

4917
05:29:17,310 --> 05:29:18,330
That's how they got me.

4918
05:29:20,770 --> 05:29:21,250
Thanks.

4919
05:29:22,770 --> 05:29:24,030
They got me through that.

4920
05:29:25,430 --> 05:29:26,150
Can we climb the bridge?

4921
05:29:26,370 --> 05:29:26,530
No.

4922
05:29:27,350 --> 05:29:29,130
Oh, wait, they fucking flew away?

4923
05:29:29,810 --> 05:29:31,290
They just, hey, that's my body.

4924
05:29:31,790 --> 05:29:32,390
Rookie!

4925
05:29:34,130 --> 05:29:36,210
Here's my body right there.

4926
05:29:37,510 --> 05:29:38,570
She's dead.

4927
05:29:39,450 --> 05:29:40,850
Oh, they're fighting above.

4928
05:29:41,090 --> 05:29:41,630
Oh, that's a tank.

4929
05:29:42,450 --> 05:29:42,590
That's a tank.

4930
05:29:42,850 --> 05:29:43,330
That's a tank.

4931
05:29:44,210 --> 05:29:46,130
Just sneak behind the tank.

4932
05:29:47,590 --> 05:29:48,850
Don't make any noise.

4933
05:29:49,030 --> 05:29:49,890
Be very quiet.

4934
05:29:51,190 --> 05:29:51,310
Wait.

4935
05:29:51,610 --> 05:29:52,350
Check the water.

4936
05:29:52,630 --> 05:29:53,810
Are there still rats in that water?

4937
05:29:53,950 --> 05:29:55,090
Maybe there's rats in that water.

4938
05:30:02,280 --> 05:30:03,680
This feels very dangerous.

4939
05:30:05,020 --> 05:30:05,320
Nope.

4940
05:30:06,520 --> 05:30:36,980

Yes.

4945
05:31:09,610 --> 05:31:10,070
Hide in that bathroom.

4946
05:31:10,270 --> 05:31:10,490
I'll tear.

4947
05:31:10,650 --> 05:31:10,850
I'll tear.

4948
05:31:10,950 --> 05:31:11,730
This is it.

4949
05:31:11,970 --> 05:31:13,310
This is it.

4950
05:31:13,310 --> 05:31:16,590
Hide in that bathroom You don't need to.

4951
05:31:16,590 --> 05:31:18,750
You don't need to fucking... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4952
05:31:18,910 --> 05:31:19,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4953
05:31:19,590 --> 05:31:19,850
Just stay there.

4954
05:31:19,970 --> 05:31:20,190
Just stay there.

4955
05:31:20,290 --> 05:31:20,890
You two just stay there.

4956
05:31:21,010 --> 05:31:21,950
Close the door if you can.

4957
05:31:22,090 --> 05:31:22,690
Can you close the door?

4958
05:31:23,730 --> 05:31:24,490
Oh, yeah.

4959
05:31:24,630 --> 05:31:25,070
Close the door.

4960
05:31:25,170 --> 05:31:25,750
Okay, just stay there.

4961
05:31:25,890 --> 05:31:26,770
Yeah, yeah, keep doing it.

4962
05:31:26,790 --> 05:31:27,930
And then it's like a firing squad.

4963
05:31:28,010 --> 05:31:28,950
It's literally a fire squad.

4964
05:31:29,070 --> 05:31:29,670
And then you walk through.

4965
05:31:30,030 --> 05:31:30,830
Yeah, that's the plan.

4966
05:31:30,910 --> 05:31:31,290
That's the plan.

4967
05:31:31,490 --> 05:31:31,890
That's the plan.

4968
05:31:32,030 --> 05:31:32,450
That is it.

4969
05:31:32,630 --> 05:31:33,290
This is it.

4970
05:31:33,370 --> 05:31:34,410
We got the strap.

4971
05:31:34,890 --> 05:31:36,290
We got the fucking strap.

4972
05:31:36,730 --> 05:31:37,930
Five squads left.

4973
05:31:38,490 --> 05:31:39,070
Oh my god.

4974
05:31:39,810 --> 05:31:41,790
Technically four squads left because you're- There's a chance.

4975
05:31:41,790 --> 05:31:47,990
Technically four squads left because you're part of the- Man, wouldn't it be funny if I did not fucking swim in the middle of that ocean?

4976
05:31:51,630 --> 05:31:52,070
Man.

4977
05:31:52,690 --> 05:31:55,430
If only I didn't swim in the middle of that ocean.

4978
05:31:59,310 --> 05:32:01,110
Oh, this- this hurts my soul.

4979
05:32:01,310 --> 05:32:02,710
This is such a cowardly way to fight.

4980
05:32:03,530 --> 05:32:04,890
Ooh, bros, across the hallway.

4981
05:32:06,610 --> 05:32:25,870
2 bros Looking at each other cuss It's nothing else to do 2 bros Sitting in the hot tub 5p in the park It's for 5p in the park Fuck I love that 2 bros sitting in the hot tub 5p in the park It's for not gay

4982
05:32:29,330 --> 05:32:29,850
Huh?

4983
05:32:31,250 --> 05:32:37,310
We're not into zen No, no it's fine It's fine The zone closes really slow I believe.

4984
05:32:38,170 --> 05:32:40,650
There's no way people throw grenades to check.

4985
05:32:43,050 --> 05:32:43,950
No, they wouldn't.

4986
05:32:43,950 --> 05:32:44,790
There's no way.

4987
05:32:44,850 --> 05:32:45,210
There's no way.

4988
05:32:45,250 --> 05:32:47,350
Nobody ever throws grenades in this game.

4989
05:32:48,670 --> 05:32:49,190
Nope.

4990
05:32:51,630 --> 05:32:52,230
Oh.

4991
05:32:54,430 --> 05:32:55,030
Oh.

4992
05:32:56,630 --> 05:32:57,470
I'm still here.

4993
05:32:57,530 --> 05:32:57,930
I'm safe.

4994
05:32:58,490 --> 05:32:58,770
No.

4995
05:33:05,590 --> 05:33:06,570
There's someone I went for.

4996
05:33:06,590 --> 05:33:07,410
There's someone on Winfield.

4997
05:33:08,230 --> 05:33:08,770
Okay, I got to heal.

4998
05:33:08,890 --> 05:33:09,270
I got to heal.

4999
05:33:15,610 --> 05:33:16,750
No, no, no, no, no.

5000
05:33:17,190 --> 05:33:18,110
Just chill a bit.

5001
05:33:18,150 --> 05:33:18,530
Just chill.

5002
05:33:18,650 --> 05:33:19,510
It's C-Swiss, too.

5003
05:33:19,650 --> 05:33:20,550
You got this.

5004
05:33:22,550 --> 05:33:23,870
They're really on Winfield right now.

5005
05:33:25,370 --> 05:33:25,770
No!

5006
05:33:26,250 --> 05:33:26,410
No!

5007
05:33:27,510 --> 05:33:27,910
Winfield!

5008
05:33:28,630 --> 05:33:29,250
No, no.

5009
05:33:29,750 --> 05:33:30,130
I'll tear.

5010
05:33:30,290 --> 05:33:30,530
Nice.

5011
05:33:31,130 --> 05:33:31,450
I'll tear.

5012
05:33:31,570 --> 05:33:32,690
I think you gotta leave him.

5013
05:33:33,330 --> 05:33:33,830
Oh, my God.

5014
05:33:33,990 --> 05:33:34,370
Never mind.

5015
05:33:34,370 --> 05:33:35,110
I will never leave Winfield.

5016
05:33:35,470 --> 05:33:35,970
Never leave him.

5017
05:33:35,970 --> 05:33:36,810
I will never leave you.

5018
05:33:37,350 --> 05:33:38,170
Oh, my God.

5019
05:33:38,290 --> 05:33:38,970

5022
05:34:14,150 --> 05:34:17,530
Okay, I would say that aim was very unfortunate to watch too.

5023
05:34:18,050 --> 05:34:20,110
I'm glad you didn't have to watch it out here.

5024
05:34:20,790 --> 05:34:24,110
I am glad you didn't have to watch it.

5025
05:34:26,290 --> 05:34:27,250
I don't...

5026
05:34:27,250 --> 05:34:28,430
What happened, Winfield?

5027
05:34:28,670 --> 05:34:29,230
It was bad.

5028
05:34:29,370 --> 05:34:32,890
What, Winfield, you were clutching it, and what happened?

5029
05:34:33,170 --> 05:34:34,430

05:47:45,270 --> 05:47:46,730
I'm playing, I pressed the wrong button.

Right here, here.

5201
05:47:47,390 --> 05:47:48,630
For the sake of the team, I'm giving them back.

5202
05:47:48,970 --> 05:47:50,950
But just know that it's not because...

5203
05:47:50,950 --> 05:47:53,510
Oh, you guys, you're in a Lula game with Baby Pier?

05:47:53,730 --> 05:47:54,590
What are you guys doing?

5205
05:47:54,850 --> 05:47:55,810
We're in a war zone.

5206
05:47:56,270 --> 05:47:57,290
I'm getting my shoes.

5207
05:48:03,430 --> 05:48:09,430

05:48:32,690 --> 05:48:34,030
There's a golf guy.

5214
05:48:34,330 --> 05:48:35,970
We're so fucking dying in that.

5215
05:48:36,190 --> 05:48:36,430

5222
05:48:41,510 --> 05:48:42,350
I gotta freak out.

5223
05:48:42,990 --> 05:48:43,330
Yes.

5224
05:48:43,610 --> 05:48:44,710
I bet all they're coming.

5225
05:48:45,270 --> 05:48:46,030
We got, we have a golf.

5226
05:48:46,150 --> 05:48:48,070
I'm sitting in the back of the golf crap.

5227
05:48:48,230 --> 05:48:49,290
I'm so getting shot at.

5228
05:48:50,330 --> 05:48:50,950
Amber here.

5229
05:48:51,630 --> 05:48:52,610
Oh my God.

5230
05:48:52,710 --> 05:48:52,850
Okay.

05:48:53,010 --> 05:48:54,250
So, but our strat, we want that.

5232
05:48:54,270 --> 05:48:54,730
We want that.

5233
05:48:54,870 --> 05:48:55,210
We want that.

5234
05:48:55,310 --> 05:48:55,490
Okay.

5235
05:48:55,570 --> 05:48:58,370
Our strat was to find a house and stay in a corner.

5236
05:48:59,590 --> 05:48:59,730
What?

5237
05:48:59,730 --> 05:49:00,330

Don't worry.

5243
05:49:37,530 --> 05:49:37,790
Oh, that was great.

5244
05:49:38,010 --> 05:49:40,810
There's another smoke too, so they'll never know that there's something inside.

5245
05:49:41,250 --> 05:49:41,910
Good work team.

5246
05:49:42,050 --> 05:49:43,610
Good use of of...

5247
05:49:43,610 --> 05:49:44,470
Why am I lagging?

5248
05:49:44,850 --> 05:49:45,830
Where are...

5249
05:49:45,830 --> 05:49:46,650
What servers are we on?

5250
05:49:46,850 --> 05:49:47,450
I don't know.

5251
05:49:47,450 --> 05:49:47,510
I don't know.

5252
05:49:47,870 --> 05:49:49,830
I don't know where we are at.

5253
05:49:50,650 --> 05:49:51,590
I think we're east coast.

5254
05:49:51,930 --> 05:49:52,370
Okay, guys.

5255
05:49:52,650 --> 05:49:53,450
What do we get?

5256
05:49:53,550 --> 05:49:54,470
What do we get here?

5257
05:49:55,310 --> 05:49:55,850
Do I get...

5258
05:49:55,850 --> 05:49:56,570
Let's go to a house.

5259
05:49:56,850 --> 05:49:58,370
I don't like standing in the middle of a golf field.

5260
05:49:58,450 --> 05:49:59,530
I don't know what to get here.

5261
05:49:59,670 --> 05:50:00,790
Oh, maybe I'll get this.

5262
05:50:00,810 --> 05:50:02,710
I'll get the SGX.

5263
05:50:02,950 --> 05:50:03,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5264
05:50:03,830 --> 05:50:04,770
Someone right above us.

5265
05:50:05,250 --> 05:50:06,030
Oh, shit.

5266
05:50:06,690 --> 05:50:07,310
They're coming in.

5267
05:50:07,870 --> 05:50:09,130
Let's get some, let's get some cover.

5268
05:50:09,890 --> 05:50:10,170
Oh, wow.

5269
05:50:10,250 --> 05:50:11,130
They're dropping in hot.

5270
05:50:12,390 --> 05:50:13,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5271
05:50:14,750 --> 05:50:15,230
One dead.

5272
05:50:15,910 --> 05:50:16,310
Nice.

5273
05:50:16,690 --> 05:50:18,090
They landed behind the house, behind the house.

5274
05:50:18,710 --> 05:50:18,990
Whoa!

5275
05:50:19,550 --> 05:50:19,790
Gotcha.

5276
05:50:20,310 --> 05:50:20,690
He's one.

5277
05:50:20,770 --> 05:50:21,170
That's mine.

5278
05:50:21,410 --> 05:50:22,330
I didn't see anything.

5279
05:50:22,630 --> 05:50:24,410
I'm going in either.

5280
05:50:24,550 --> 05:50:25,770
I don't see the people you're shooting at.

5281
05:50:25,790 --> 05:50:26,070
I broke the house.

5282
05:50:26,210 --> 05:50:27,190
I destroyed the house.

5283
05:50:28,170 --> 05:50:28,730
He's dead.

5284
05:50:28,810 --> 05:50:29,090
One down.

5285
05:50:29,510 --> 05:50:29,910
Nice.

5286
05:50:32,590 --> 05:50:33,790
Is that everybody?

5287
05:50:34,670 --> 05:50:34,710
I don't know.

5288
05:50:34,710 --> 05:50:35,450
I don't see it.

5289
05:50:35,690 --> 05:50:37,050
There are no squad wipes, so we don't know.

5290
05:50:38,310 --> 05:50:39,890
One of them might be like 20 miles.

5291
05:50:39,890 --> 05:50:40,890
I'm a UAV up, so...

5292
05:50:41,490 --> 05:50:42,630
Wait, where's the guy we down here?

5293
05:50:43,370 --> 05:50:44,690
I think he... where is he?

5294
05:50:44,910 --> 05:50:45,390
No, you're right.

5295
05:50:46,030 --> 05:50:46,110
Yeah.

5296
05:50:47,190 --> 05:50:47,710
Oh, nice.

5297
05:50:48,130 --> 05:50:49,810
Oh, they're...

5298
05:50:50,710 --> 05:50:51,530
Oh, they're far.

5299
05:50:51,890 --> 05:50:52,870
What the shit?

5300
05:50:53,710 --> 05:50:54,590
Okay, well...

5301
05:50:54,590 --> 05:50:55,910
Wait, where did you see it?

5302
05:50:56,070 --> 05:50:56,290
Oh.

5303
05:50:58,190 --> 05:50:59,770
There's someone raising a chemical.

5304
05:51:02,070 --> 05:51:54,710

Hit who?

5306
05:51:57,430 --> 05:51:59,070
There's a guy in this building.

5307
05:51:59,590 --> 05:51:59,990
Watch yourself!

5308
05:52:02,780 --> 05:52:04,040
He's in there, he dropped in there, yeah?

5309
05:52:04,380 --> 05:52:04,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5310
05:52:06,880 --> 05:52:09,360
I don't know if he's still in there, but that's where he was.

5311
05:52:10,700 --> 05:52:12,700
Oh, I don't say him, I don't say him.

5312
05:52:12,740 --> 05:52:14,500
Maybe he ran like a little bitch.

5313
05:52:15,740 --> 05:52:16,460
I would too.

5314
05:52:19,890 --> 05:52:21,610
Is that even reaching up?

5315
05:52:21,630 --> 05:52:22,590
I think we're safe right now.

5316
05:52:24,190 --> 05:52:25,850
Now I'm pretty sure he ran away.

5317
05:52:27,530 --> 05:52:30,370
There's no way he's still in there unless he's camping.

5318
05:52:32,290 --> 05:52:34,910
What is that red light over there?

5319
05:52:35,110 --> 05:52:35,850
Oh, okay.

5320
05:52:36,510 --> 05:52:37,910
Okay, who sent that in?

5321
05:52:38,190 --> 05:52:39,210
Who sent that in?

5322
05:52:39,570 --> 05:52:40,170
Oh my goodness.

5323
05:52:41,350 --> 05:52:44,370
So that guy is at the special crate.

5324
05:52:45,150 --> 05:52:47,290
Inside, inside.

5325
05:52:47,810 --> 05:52:48,050
First floor.

5326
05:52:48,710 --> 05:52:49,710
Oh, that must have been him.

5327
05:52:53,630 --> 05:52:54,530
I'm looking.

5328
05:52:55,970 --> 05:52:56,350
Oh, wait, wait.

5329
05:52:56,370 --> 05:52:56,970
There's a teammate.

5330
05:52:57,170 --> 05:52:58,110
His teammates here.

5331
05:53:01,850 --> 05:53:04,150
We don't have to cross this in fight, honestly.

5332
05:53:04,250 --> 05:53:04,550
I see them.

5333
05:53:05,010 --> 05:53:06,190
I feel like we're giving up.

5334
05:53:06,190 --> 05:53:06,710
We're here.

5335
05:53:07,610 --> 05:53:08,650
We ran up.

5336
05:53:10,510 --> 05:53:11,290
Right by the car.

5337
05:53:11,770 --> 05:53:12,650
I'm going to hold high.

5338
05:53:12,750 --> 05:53:13,210
Oh, he's resting.

5339
05:53:13,370 --> 05:53:13,610
He's resting.

5340
05:53:13,950 --> 05:53:14,670
Oh, he is.

5341
05:53:15,910 --> 05:53:16,570
Let me get a better angle.

5342
05:53:17,370 --> 05:53:17,570
I'm well.

5343
05:53:17,870 --> 05:53:19,590
My game volume is on, like, two right now.

5344
05:53:21,250 --> 05:53:22,150
How are you guys still?

5345
05:53:22,150 --> 05:53:22,830
Guys, we have him.

5346
05:53:23,770 --> 05:53:24,510
That's why we're still getting him.

5347
05:53:24,510 --> 05:53:25,090
He's probably got to get a hill.

5348
05:53:25,670 --> 05:53:26,310
He's got to get it off.

5349
05:53:26,670 --> 05:53:27,710
Oh, you got it off.

5350
05:53:27,870 --> 05:53:28,410
Yeah, yeah.

5351
05:53:28,810 --> 05:53:29,270
Actually, wait.

5352
05:53:29,370 --> 05:53:29,950
I think he came.

5353
05:53:29,950 --> 05:53:30,190
Yeah.

5354
05:53:30,330 --> 05:53:30,810
He went inside.

5355
05:53:30,930 --> 05:53:31,330
He went inside.

5356
05:53:31,490 --> 05:53:31,750
He went inside.

5357
05:53:32,910 --> 05:53:33,170
He went inside.

5358
05:53:34,330 --> 05:53:35,470
I'm right here with you.

5359
05:53:35,610 --> 05:53:36,230
I'm right behind you.

5360
05:53:36,910 --> 05:53:39,810
Hit him 100 100.

5361
05:53:40,010 --> 05:53:41,390
Oh, he's tried to get- he's dead.

5362
05:53:41,910 --> 05:53:42,130
He's dead.

5363
05:53:42,370 --> 05:53:42,710

05:55:46,550 --> 05:55:46,810
Axel is going.

5407
05:55:47,050 --> 05:55:47,290
I have no shields.

5408
05:55:47,490 --> 05:55:47,930
I have no shields.

5409
05:55:48,210 --> 05:55:49,190
Oh, I haven't.

5410
05:55:49,330 --> 05:55:49,670

Thank you.

5414
05:55:53,390 --> 05:55:55,190
I'm following Axel right now.

5415
05:55:56,370 --> 05:55:56,930
fighting someone?

5416
05:55:58,190 --> 05:55:59,630
Yeah, just a vehicle they ran off.

5417
05:56:00,150 --> 05:56:00,150
Okay.

5418
05:56:01,250 --> 05:56:03,250
I'm looking below us just in case.

5419
05:56:04,630 --> 05:56:06,650
Make sure there's nobody right behind us.

5420
05:56:06,830 --> 05:56:07,490
I like this car.

5421
05:56:07,790 --> 05:56:09,250
It's very safe.

5422
05:56:09,350 --> 05:56:10,150
Uh-huh, sure.

5423
05:56:10,950 --> 05:56:12,110
They just drove off.

5424
05:56:13,170 --> 05:56:14,170
There's people in front of us.

5425
05:56:14,630 --> 05:56:14,750
Okay.

5426
05:56:15,170 --> 05:56:15,590
Yeah.

5427
05:56:16,590 --> 05:56:18,470
Are they in a vehicle or what?

5428
05:56:19,570 --> 05:56:20,610
Bad position.

5429
05:56:21,150 --> 05:56:23,930
I don't know how I can shoot that.

5430
05:56:24,070 --> 05:56:24,350
Careful training.

5431
05:56:24,530 --> 05:56:26,310
There's people on the street as well and up the hill.

5432
05:56:26,370 --> 05:56:27,970
I see the guy right here.

5433
05:56:29,090 --> 05:56:29,890
There's multiple.

5434
05:56:34,030 --> 05:56:35,830
I'm shooting the guy under the truck right now.

5435
05:56:36,330 --> 05:56:38,590
I don't see the guys on the hill right now.

5436
05:56:38,950 --> 05:56:39,910
We need to reposition.

5437
05:56:40,190 --> 05:56:40,990
This is...

5438
05:56:40,990 --> 05:56:42,230

05:56:42,330 --> 05:56:42,570

5450
05:57:32,110 --> 05:57:34,570
I don't know where that team behind us went, but we're playing soft side.

5451
05:57:34,710 --> 05:57:36,030
So this is, this looks okay.

5452
05:57:36,190 --> 05:57:37,670
We could, we could take the jump tower if you want to.

5453
05:57:38,250 --> 05:57:41,930
I like, I kind of like playing this in its own way, but we could take it.

5454
05:57:41,990 --> 05:57:42,410
All right.

5455
05:57:42,650 --> 05:57:43,590
There's nobody around us.

5456
05:57:43,970 --> 05:57:44,070
Yeah.

5457
05:57:44,270 --> 05:57:45,870

There's a team.

Both teams.

5574
06:00:51,500 --> 06:00:52,180
Both teams southwest.

5575
06:00:54,060 --> 06:00:54,560
Play slow.

5584
06:01:09,220 --> 06:01:11,820
