48
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,440

51
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,120
Stop getting sick.

52
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,540
What do you mean?

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,300
You get sick more than me.

54
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,220
What the fuck are you talking about?

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,120
You're always getting sick, because you're always traveling.

56
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,000
You don't practice your social distancing.

57
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:44,750
You don't.

58
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm literally, I have to be inside people.

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,340
It's not my fault that they, like, pass through me and
stuff.

60
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,840
Yeah, every person who pass through gives you the germs.

61
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:04,100
yeah um and then and yeah and then i slept i slept through
my alarm i almost slept through my alarm i woke up i set two

62
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:12,820
alarms um i stopped my first alarm and then i turned off my
second alarm because i was like i'll need that i'm awake now

63
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:24,140
yeah i was like i'll need that it should be fine and then
and then i took a quick power nap of five minutes and i woke

64
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,240
up and it was like 10 minutes before the stream and I was
like, oh, fuck.

65
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,260
It's not even one REM cycle.

66
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,860
And then I messaged Min and I was like, hey, I'm sorry.

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,580
I just like, I almost slept through my alarm.

68
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,700
And then Min was like, oh my God, I forgot.

69
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm done fast.

70
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:41,960
Bye.

71
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,300
So she forgot too, guys, even though.

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,400
I did not forget.

73
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,920
I was watching Detective Conan.

74
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,080
You're watching.

75
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,620
Wait, are you like up to date?

76
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,680
Were you like catching up?

77
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:03,720
with detective conan no uh there's like netflix has some
conan episode like specials on there oh so you weren't up to

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,540
date with the conan oh no i'm not up to date with conan at
all yeah yeah i mean how how can you be i think like they

79
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:19,240
have more episodes than like dragon ball z or one piece most
likely i got i was current up to a thousand geez wait

80
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,680
actually how many wait who has more episodes one piece or
conan because you know how like one piece literally just

81
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,880
ended their first season first season

82
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:42,820
i'm pretty sure conan like has been going yeah going on
longer than one piece in general okay google says one piece

83
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,380
is at one thousand one hundred and fifty five which means
conan definitely has more because they're at like 200

84
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,140
something wait detective they're at like only 200 not even a
thousand two hundred yeah yeah yeah that's what i mean yeah

85
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,560
i was like only Only 200.

86
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,720
Those are been lumps long.

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,620
You've been on hiatus.

88
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,620
Oh, it's close.

89
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,680
Conan is at 1,188, apparently.

90
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,160
Wait, what was One Piece?

91
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,820
1,155.

92
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,120
Oh, Conan, you're slacking.

93
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
They took too many breaks.

94
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,000
Wait, that means I'm not far behind Conan.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,340
I'm only in like 288-ish episodes or something.

96
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,240
Yeah, see, One Piece was on season one.

97
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,460
I think Conan has been on multiple seasons.

98
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,940
Oh, yeah, Conan.

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:34,500
okay but what's weird is like yeah i know this is like
google maybe google being weird but google says like one

100
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,360
piece is at season 21 and no i think that's like arcs though
because like in japan like they're what they consider a

101
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:52,480
season is like arcs you know like uh this arc is now like oh
they ended the arc so that's one season done oh i know bro

102
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,200
that's you gotta revoke your Kevin, you didn't know that?

103
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,980
Well, I know.

104
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,480
I always counted when a new opening song or new ending song
is used.

105
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,420
It's a new season.

106
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,720
Is that how it usually works?

107
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,140
That's how it usually works at video, right?

108
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,260
I don't know that.

109
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:09,760
I don't know.

110
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,540
I just, maybe they just, no, because like half seasons.

111
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,020
Because like in JJK.

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,920
That's so half season.

113
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:21,880
No, because in JJK and season one, they changed their anime
opening midseason.

114
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,660
So you can't use that because they...

115
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,080
Yeah, see, not anymore, Minto.

116
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,940
That's how it used to be.

117
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,400
I'm a boomer.

118
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm a boomer anime fan.

119
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,000
They switch open 80 midseason.

120
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,440
Hagalit.

121
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,720
Nah.

122
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,840
Nah, that's, I see people in chat saying.

123
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,300
I've never denied that.

124
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,760
Don't think you're any better than me.

125
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,760
Boomer.

126
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,840
Yeah, but that makes me younger than you.

127
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,500
Oh, 10% off gamer subs.

128
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,320
Use code Boomer.

129
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you.

130
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,720
Thank you for promoting my code, boomer, code boomer.

131
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,060
Or you know, you could use code JokeyBread on Fortnite as
well.

132
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,200
And because of that, I'm booting up Fortnite.

133

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,440
We don't start Metal Gear until I get to show off my skins.

137
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm holding this stream hostage.

138

He loves the lake, too.

247
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,280

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Please be honest with me.

He does.

Yeah, he does.

251
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,340
It's the hair.

252
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,880
See, everybody, I'm not crazy.

253
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,520
It's the hair.

254
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm pretty.

255
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,980
It is.

256
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,860
If he had a black suit on, it'd be more like John Wick.

257
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,720
Yeah.

258
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,980
Like, Alan Wake, too.

259
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,000
Alan Wake looks just like John Wick.

260
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,920
Yeah, he really.

261
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,220

They're so creepy looking.

298
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,850
Why are they so realistic looking at the horse?

299
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,030
I think they're like, I'm pretty sure they like 3D scan the
shoes themselves.

300
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,810
Because they don't look like they were modeled.

301
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,190
They were modeled themselves because all the shoes looked
like they were fucking 3D scan.

302
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,630
Wait, what does Xenomorph look with the crocs?

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,790
He's having a great time.

318
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,490
My xenomorph's a weave.

319
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,810

00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,950
Wait, do you have the Mikubian?

322
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,590

Yeah, this is my favorite.

328
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,350
Yeah, this one is the classic.

329
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,430
This is...

330
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,610
I also bought this.

331
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,610
I hope you get a DMCA.

332
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,230
Oh, 100%, I will.

333
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,550
I mean, the first playthrough already got...

334
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,230
strike because of snake eaters.

335
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,050
So I was just like, it's fine.

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,310
It does.

338
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:46,810
Yeah.

339
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,150
Yeah,

340
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,550

341
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,190
Oh, okay.

342
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,430
Anyway, so that is my collection.

343
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,970
What do you think?

344
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,370
That's alright.

345
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,550
What do you mean it's all right?

346
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,090
All right.

347
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,110

353
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,870
Why is it so tall?

354
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,410
Oh my God, I'm watching this happen in real time.

355
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,890
Oh my God, it's in the shop.

356
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,430
Guys, remember to use my creator code, Doki Bird.

357
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,430
Remember to use that?

358
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,730

No, you'll understand.

360
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,490
No, you'll understand when you see it.

361
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,170
I've seen clips of the repo people dancing and you'll
understand.

362
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,110

Why are they so tall?

366
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,510
They have to be tall.

367
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,010
They have to be tall to do the dances.

368
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,390
To do the silly dances.

369
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,670

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,450
And he has to wear socks with the crocs.

375
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,410
And he's...

376
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,050
The fact that he's wearing socks with the crocs.

377
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,330
That's great.

378
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,390

Me too.

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,230
I don't know if they did do Princess Bubblegum, but I'm
pretty sure I saw Marcelline's guitar.

421
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,670
Oh, maybe.

422
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,450

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,040
I said it.

461
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,560
You didn't say it.

462
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,020
I'm not asking for the name of the song.

463
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,820
You say the name of the song.

464
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,560

466
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,640
What are you...

467
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,580
It's not my fault.

468
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,400
Your ears didn't work.

I didn't care.

474
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,260
You should say it really loud because I'm sure then if I
didn't hear, some people in chat didn't hear.

475
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,540
No, no, my chat heard it loud in here.

520
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,320
It's so stupid.

521
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,000
Not anywhere where I'll get my gun out.

522
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,780
Where's my gun?

523
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,240
The other side.

524
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,780
The other side.

525
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,860
Oh, there it is.

526
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,220
Yeah.

527
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,240
That's not a gun.

528
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:36,940
That's a knife.

529
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
Oh, you have a gun somewhere.

530
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,980

531
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,020

Oh, my God.

Yeah, but like, okay.

594

595
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh, if you pick them up, they'll drop stuff.

All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

609
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,940
Don't worry, I got a double kill here.

610
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,800
Shagom, shagom.

611
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,420
There you go.

612
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Kill everybody.

613
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,160
Yay.

614
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,380
That's like the most important part of this game is to kill
them all.

615
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,460
I like that.

616
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:13,980
Okay.

617
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,140
There's no consequences on my actions, right?

618
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Is that why you're trying to tell me to kill them all?

619
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,560
Yeah, of course.

620
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,040
Okay.

621
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:20,860
I'll be.

622
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,920
Why would there be consequences?

623
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,920
I don't know.

624
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,680
Very insistent that I kill all of them.

625
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,240
And like, isn't Meta Gear supposed to be about stealth?

626
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,380
Yeah, but this is part of stealth, is it not?

627
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,120
Is it?

628
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:34,540
Is it?

629
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,860
I did not realize stealth means kill everyone.

630
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,440
You know, I think I love stealth.

631
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,260
Exactly.

632
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,580
Stealth is pretty cool.

633
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,400
That didn't I realize I could just kill everyone.

634
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,280
Yeah.

635
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,920
Okay, I'm slowly remembering all these controls.

636
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,580
You know what's the worst part is that...

637
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:52,980
See, I told you to come back.

638
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,400
Also, I'm playing God of War right now, too.

639
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,680
So I need to remember...

640
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,460
So I'm going to get confused with God of War controls and
Metal Gear controls.

641
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,900
No.

642
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,340
Nobody ever does that.

643
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:04,900
Yeah?

644
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,120
It'll be fine.

645
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,980
Don't forget, you can also crouch walk.

646
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,360
Wait, how do I crouch walk?

647
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,140
Like this?

648
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,580
Like this.

649
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,460
Oh, okay.

650
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,400
I'm crouch walking.

651
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,640
Am I doing it?

652
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,060
You are, you are.

653
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:16,820
Okay.

654
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,420
Do you remember this area?

655
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,260
Uh, this is tutorial.

656
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,300
Yeah.

657
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm back to where I started.

658
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,200
Wait, why am I not wearing my mask?

659
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,340
There you go.

660
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:29,920
I don't know.

661
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,880
That's your dumb decision to not wear it.

662
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,620
I thought this was a group effort.

663
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,720
Oh, this is where the frog was.

664
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,520
Oh, he's gone.

665
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,120
He left.

666
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
I'm here for the vibes.

667
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,080
There's another frog and another duck in this area then.

668
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,120
Oh, all right.

669
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,900
Well, we got to progress.

670
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,240
We got to save the world.

671
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,220
We got to save the world, man.

672
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,480
Yep, everybody.

673
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,200
Look at that.

674
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,160
She cares more about the frogs than, I don't know, than
America right now.

675
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,740
I've never cared more about America than in this game.

676
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Oh, yeah.

677
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,380

00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,860
I think it's the game just being a little funky.

729
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,560
No, no.

730
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,040

731
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,820
Stomp is V.

750
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,940
Your stamina is dropping.

751
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,200
That's okay, it's okay.

752
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,500

It's all right.

757
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,180
My stamina might be dropping, but it's okay.

758
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,520
It's okay.

759
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,520

00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:00,820

764
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,680

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,780
I grabbed it from a Western munitions armory.

866
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,460
It probably used to belong to one of your officers.

867
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,140
And there are more where that came from.

868
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,300
You had this with you, didn't you?

869
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,000
Better take this too.

870
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,780
What's that?

871
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Oh, is that my disguise?

872
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,120
Yeah.

873
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,380
Oh, I just need my glasses.

874
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,300
You're gonna be a...

875
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:47,480
scientist i'm gonna be a nerd yes he's being forced to
continue guys i haven't up the volume yet because if i do

876
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,880
i'll it'll like pause the cut scene they've got a whole army
of scientists they're developing new weapons security is

877
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:02,420
tight but if you do it now i'll just be quiet oh oh it won't
let me tab out never mind oh

878
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,080
it was like you want me to skip the cut scene

879
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,560
First, you'll need to head north through the jungle.

880
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,500
Wait, can I actually...

881
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,080
Oh, I can't.

882
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:18,320
Pause.

883
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,240
It says pause.

884
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,140
Oh, pause.

885
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,720
Pause.

886
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,300
Pause.

887
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:23,340
Wait.

888
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,020
Wait, didn't pause.

889
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,100
It's not pausing.

890
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:26,980
Yeah, it's not pausing.

891
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,760
Guys, it didn't pause for me.

892
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,140
I'm too scared to keep doing it.

893
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,620
Yeah, just wait until it's over so you don't skip it on
accident.

894
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,460
Make your way through the warehouse and you'll come out just
south of the lab.

895
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,000
I love this part.

896
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,700
And just what are you doing there?

897
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,680
Oh, I'm modifying.

898
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,740
I'm putting a silencer.

899
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,400
In close range combat, a knife can sometimes be more useful
than a gun.

900
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,260
By doing this, I'll be able to hold a knife at the same time
and still keep the gun steady.

901
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,860
That way, I can instantly switch between a gun battle and a
knife fight.

902
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,700
It's the essential parts of CQC.

903
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,160
The CQC?

904
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,780
Oh, close.

905
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,960
Quarter's combat.

906
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:08,560
Yeah.

907
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:10,920
Yeah!

908
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,320
Yeah!

909
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,720
Oh, he not fine.

910
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,780
It's a jungle out there.

911
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,960
It's a jungle out there.

912
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,380
The Russian jungles.

913
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,460
Oh my gosh.

914
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,380
What Russia is most known for.

915
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,200
Yeah.

916
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,980
Gators and jungles.

917
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,620
I have to get back.

918
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,420
I can't be gone for too long.

919
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,380
They'll start to suspect something.

920
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,490
Don't worry.

921
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,670
I will not be surprised to gojima just adds a lion in this
game.

922
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,790
Can you guess what other animals are in this game?

923
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,970
The famous Russian lions.

924
00:48:59,350 --> 00:48:59,650
Mm-hmm.

925
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,490
All right, then.

926
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:03,250
I'll do something special for you.

927
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,320
Ah!

928
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,500
R1!

929
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,080
R1!

930
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,620
R1!

931
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,820
You don't need the R1.

932
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,440
I'll stand watch until dawn.

933
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,100
Now be a good boy and lie down.

934
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,100
Oh!

939
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:05,920
all right whenever you save the game and quit you'll go to
sleep oh sleeping allows you to gain back stamina naturally

940
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,080
depending on how long you sleep you may also oh so if i
don't like if i don't play the game for a while i go get

00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:23,600
full hp yeah but also um your food does like expire too oh
yeah so if you don't play for a while your food will go bad

942
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:33,380
oh i see okay let me turn up the volume a little bit more
all right guys let me know if the volume's okay now are you

00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,780
Never trust a woman.

951
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,480
Yeah, never trust women.

952
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,440
Yeah.

953
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,120
Especially not in a bond again.

954
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,780
Oh, you can R1 again.

957
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:22,900
Oh

958
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,320
What's the matter we're surrounded I See four of them.

959
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,680
Oh my god, it's the red berets.

960
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,800
It's the Ocelot crew.

961
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,120
Yeah, the Ocelot unit.

962
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,200
See I remember

963
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,210
That musy's close If I can smell him.

964
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,430
Of course you can smell it.

965
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:03,130
Do you own any dojins based off of this bearing?

966
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:05,790
Uh, no.

967
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,970
It's not.

968
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,010
It's more difficult to find than you would think.

969
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:10,930
Wait, really?

970
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:11,930
Yeah.

971
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,010
I'm not surprising.

972
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:17,410
I have more dojins of snake and snake than snake.

973
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,630
Ah, yes, the snake says...

974
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,050
okay love is very important

975
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:52,870
like i have a lot of safe for work metal gear dogen's don't
get me wrong but i also but for like you know not oh wait

976
00:52:52,870 --> 00:53:03,890
yeah they're coming out wait wait yeah they're coming in now
they won't know oh wait i could someone said call it sing it

977
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,610
uh singing

978
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:11,610
Those rifles the Ocelots are using aren't AK-47s, are they?

979
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:12,390
No.

980
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,690
They kind of look like AKMs, but they're different.

981
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:16,710
They're in Russia.

982
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,470
You know, AK-47s were invented by Russians.

983
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:20,830
It's vertical type 4 grips.

984
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,910
And the muzzle suppressor is bigger.

985
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:23,750
Oh my God.

986
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,410
But they're not AK-47s.

987
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,050
Hungary has a unique modified version of the AKM called the
AMD-63.

988
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,250
So it's not really quite okay.

989
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,410
I'll open it up more.

990
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:44,210
imported some of those prototypes if they're using a carbine
version of the AMD 63 like I'm thinking then they could be a

991
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:51,530
serious threat those things oh yeah I think they want you to
call about the box yeah yeah yeah he's too busy talking

992
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:59,270
about they're nerdy out about guns right now and you're that
much more likely to get seriously hurt keep your eyes open

993
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:12,790
don't worry I can call him again so true oh okay all right
more fun facts guys more fun facts

994
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,530
you like my okay cool okay so they also have shotguns

995
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:32,730
yeah they they sometimes if you don't call very often
there's like a backlog oh my god okay so they also have guns

996
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,510
but Oh, and scorpions?

997
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,510
Okay, how many fucking guns do they have?

998
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,590
Like, I saw four of them.

999
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:43,150
This is literally his job.

1000
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,150
Doki, this is his job.

1001
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,650
Okay, okay, that's the fourth gun.

1002
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,830
There's no way they're gonna carry a mysterious fifth gun.

1003
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,370
Because we saw four guys.

1004
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,830
There might be more.

1005
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,910
Oh, okay, and also they're carrying grenades.

1006
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:54,710
Okay, cool.

1007
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,370
You could get burned too.

1008
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,850
If somebody throws a grenade at you, get away from it.

1009
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:03,110
Do you not see my cool-ass box?

1010
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,170
Oh my god

1011
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:16,910
Wait to attach just wait that's how true was very important
we go wait that was actually That was wait okay, oh no

1012
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,550
You're you if your suppressor breaks then you have to find
another one.

1013
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,550
Okay, okay, okay.

1014
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,110
That's good.

1015
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:30,790
That's good to know Okay, um, wait also I want to see if I
can actually just raise the Audio of the doc.

1016
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:35,190
Nope never mind You could you could Turn down like the other
stuff.

1017
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,350
I don't know.

1018
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,210
I'm gonna turn down.

1019
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,490
Oh shit, not all the way down.

1020
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,750
I'm gonna turn down the sound effect just in case.

1021
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,730
And then...

1022
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,490
That and then...

1023
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:44,630
Yeah, that should be fine.

1024
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:45,930
Yeah, that should be fine now.

1025
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,930
And then I'll... I think that's the only thing, right?

1026
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:49,730
Yeah.

1027
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:51,870
Alright.

1028
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:53,450
Alright.

1029
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,010
New volume time.

1030
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,510
Alright, let me know guys if this is better.

1031
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,890
Sound guy.

1032
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,210
I think our usual sound guy is like...

1033
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:02,590
A rev.

1034
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,370
Oh, they...

1035
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:07,930
Yeah, what is this box doing here?

1036
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:08,650
It's so...

01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:13,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1215
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:15,010
Oh my gosh, my ass is sticking out.

1216
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:15,970
My dumpy.

1217
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:16,650
Oh, it is.

1218
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:17,490
Snake's dumpy.

1219
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,350
So that's why they always notice.

1220
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,030
That's why.

1221
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:22,090
Yeah, yeah.

1222
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,210
Sounds like the Cobra units members names came from.

1223
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:25,870
Oh my God.

1224
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,370
Don't you not see my cool ass boxes?

1225
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:30,070
Yeah.

1226
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,470
For unbearable torment, the pain.

1227
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:34,550
The pain.

1228
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,870
For true oblivion, the end.

1229
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:37,970
The end.

1230
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:54,130
the fury oh my gosh the joy joy the joy it's another name
for the boss because of the joy she feels in battle I

1231
01:03:54,130 --> 01:04:11,830
suppose during the war she had a partner named the sorrow
yeah this is so edgy you see my box You're like really

1232
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:12,530
behind.

1233
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,150
What do you mean?

1234
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:20,290
He literally showed up like in the beginning of this
chapter.

1235
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,270
Yeah, and that was nighttime.

1236
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:24,430
That was an hour ago.

1237
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,850
That was an hour ago.

1238
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:28,470
You have been streaming for an hour.

1239
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:31,190
Like 20, 30 minutes of that was Fortnite.

1240
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,550
So shut the hell up.

1241
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,630
That was 30 minutes ago.

1242
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:38,970
Oh, yeah.

1243
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,730
I remember the Alamo.

1244
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:43,010
Remember the Alamo.

1245
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,910
You know, I'm no one gonna call you anymore.

1246
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:50,690
You don't fucking know anyway.

1247
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,210
I'm gonna call my dad.

1248
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:54,670
Hey, dad.

1249
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,030
Oh, I thought he was gonna say, good job, boy, for killing
all of them.

1250
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,730
Oh, hey, dad, I killed all of them.

1251
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:05,290
Is that cool?

1252
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,370
Oh, okay.

1253
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,170
See, he's to the point.

1254
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,150
He only says one thing.

1255
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:13,570
SIG still has like fucking 20 chapters left.

1256
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,830
He's telling you where to go.

1257
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,250
You've got an M1911A1.

1258
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:18,210
Sure I do.

1259
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:21,230
I'm gonna go to get some water while you...

1260
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:23,310
Always listen to SIG talking.

1261
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:24,750
Yeah, yeah.

1262
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,090
It's a real gem of an automatic pistol.

1263
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,670
But aren't you gonna need more than just one little handgun?

1264
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:30,970
Not at all.

1265
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:36,810
When you're in a tight spot or fighting in close quarters,
sometimes a handgun works better than a rifle.

1266
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:43,550
And if I equip a knife at the same time, time i can
instantaneously switch over oh that's the same thing i told

1267
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:51,370
the other girl that 45 you've got there is a lot different
from the original though it looks like it's more than a

1268
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:59,270
little first of all the feeding ramp is polished to a mirror
it's not going to have he's like nerding the out his leg

1269
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:07,850
finally i can tell more tell more people about my gun the
frame itself yeah he's really proud proud of that technique

1270
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:14,250
that he definitely invented to himself the front strap part
of the frame has been checkered to make it dig into the hand

1271
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:23,890
that prevents any slipping the sight systems original too
it's a we can't snake you really love guns giving its

1272
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:31,650
superior target sighting capability the regular hammer has
been replaced with a ring hammer that enhances the cocking

1273
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:39,510
control and increases the hammer down speed they also rework
the grip safety to accommodate the ring hammer like they

1274
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:47,790
eliminated it altogether this is a tool for pros the thumb
safety and the slide stop are extended to allow for more

1275
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:55,610
precise handling the base of the trigger guard is whittled
down so you can use a high grip and the trigger itself is a

1276
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:06,730
long type for easy finger like a true american did you get
the box yet how does he know how heavy no no he's he's

1277
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:16,850
nerding out about his gun that's about right it's the
obsession yeah the main spring housing has been changed to a

1278
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:25,350
flat type to increase grip well you look you play you know
lsbs this is what you're into when firing i on top of that i

1279
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:34,810
they added caulking serrations to the i don't know what i
don't know what what sub what are the gun types i'd be like

1280
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:38,150
which what's the which was the machine gun guys which

1281

01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,690

01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:57,130
Okay, okay, third time's a try.

1286
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,690
Snake, what are you doing?

1287

I'm in the box!

1289
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:09,150
I was just looking at it, and suddenly I got this
irresistible urge to get inside.

1297
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,750

Yeah.

1301

They'll never know.

01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:19,850
Yeah, why would they know?

1303
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,090
I'd go to the left.

1304
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,310
Yeah.

1305
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,390

01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:27,090
Oh, there it is.

1308
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,510
Cutscene activated.

1309
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:33,550
Oh, oh, is that my potential future boyfriend?

1310
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:38,410
Pew.

1311
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:39,170
Pew, pew.

1312

Oh, my God.

1316
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:18,060
wearing perfume He has to eliminate the competition.

1317
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,700
I see you've got yourself a single-action army.

1318
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,680
That's right.

1319
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,320
Oh my god, he's gonna say it.

1320
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,320
He's gonna say it.

1321
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,020
Oh, he's gonna go back.

1322
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,780
Well, it wouldn't have happened if you hadn't been showing
off.

1323
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,040
What did you say?

1324
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,160
It's a nice gun.

1325
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,020
I'll give you that.

1326
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:36,980
Oh, oh, oh.

1327
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,340
Graving's giving me no tactical attention.

1328
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,560
Why do I have to do it?

1329
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,560
Unless you were planning to auction it off.

1330
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,340
Look, it looks sick, okay?

1331
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,520
What?

1332
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:53,540
What?

1333
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,500
Oh, because he's too in love.

1334
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,820
He's like, I can't kill you.

1335
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:07,260
Oh, even the gun knows.

1336
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,560
Oh, it's jammed.

1337
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,440
Yeah, kick his butt.

1338
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,920
Oh, my God.

1339
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:26,610
Oh shit!

1340
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:28,350
What the?

1341
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,850
That's a tired of the face.

1342
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,570
Six shots.

1343
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,980
You have to get a feel for how many you have left.

1344
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,220
Look at nerd.

1345
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,380
He counts bullets.

1346
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,380
Oh yes he does.

1347
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,600
This is a high class weapon.

1348
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,800
It's not meant for shooting people.

1349
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,120
What is it meant for?

1350
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:01,920
But it's a gun.

1351
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,600
Okay.

1352
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,940
This one is like a collector's guy.

1353
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,380
Because it's our position.

1354
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,240
The gun rocks.

1355
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:14,860
He's so...

1356
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:15,720
Don't.

1357
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:17,820
Why?

1358
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,820
He's still young.

1359
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,020
He's still young.

1360
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,660
No, he won't.

1361
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,580
Well, maybe well.

1362
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,180
He doesn't regret it.

1363
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,180
Nah.

1364
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,200
There's like four to five more games with him.

1365
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,260
Oh, she's so cool.

1366
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,580
I know she's so awesome.

1367
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,160
Do a flip.

1368
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:46,740
Oh, shit.

1369
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,600
She did a flip basically off of a guy's face.

1370
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,680
So, you know.

1371
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,960
He's got to protect her's future boyfriend.

1372
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,260
He doesn't know it yet.

1373
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,240
But like...

1374
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,020
Oh, I think he knows.

1375
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,900
No, the Ocelot doesn't know it yet.

1376
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,480
But they're going to get together.

1377
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,320
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1378
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:08,220
Yeah, especially after the Cold War ends.

1379
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:11,160
And then Ocelot's gonna move to America to see...

1380
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,280
Oh, we have to go back, right?

1381
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,620

Oh my god, I'm a fucking animal.

1447
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,630
I eat all of this raw?

1448
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,290
Bro, what the fuck is wrong with this?

1449
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:44,170
Do you know you eat too much raw meat?

1450
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:47,630
You can actually have like brain worms or some shit.

1451
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:50,250
That's if you eat like human brains, okay?

1452
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,630
Okay, I'm pretty sure like, don't there's mad cow disease.

1453
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:56,590
Isn't that when you eat too much raw meat?

1454
01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:01,470
That's like if you eat human brains, you can get the
equivalent of mad cow disease.

1455
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:03,350
Oh, okay, so it's not gonna eat raw meat.

1456
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:10,370

guy that like almost died because all he did was eat raw

1457
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:20,350
meat because he's like that's the manly thing to do and then
he almost like and he got into the hospital probably i'm

to come over oh yeah the liver king yeah that guy oh yeah

1459
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:37,050
all he did was eat like raw meat and then he like was like
i'm not on steroids and then like he was actually on

1460
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:47,410

things I'd been taking for granted What did you see?

1477

What?

1482
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,500
Not the actual universe.

1483
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,600
The universe as the intelligence.

1484
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,200
Oh, okay.

1485
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,240

was saying there's a world of difference between this

1488
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:48,840
country and america but it's only a difference of position a
difference of perspective coming here made me realize

1489
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,840
something half of what i've been told was a complete she's a
female her age is 28.

1490
01:19:54,460 --> 01:20:05,820
was a conveniently constructed yeah she's also had the truth
is boob surgery oh i can tell you yeah you'll learn that

1491
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:14,680
later she didn't say the lula d la boo she could be she
could be a liar she could be yeah because i asked her what

1492
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:21,740
is the code and then she just shot people as a distraction
yeah and then she was like that's your answer no it's not

1493
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:28,740
yeah it's not our answer is 142.52 Okay, you have to
memorize it.

Yeah.

1498
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,480
It doesn't seem desperate, right?

1499
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:44,740
No, she would never think that.

1500
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:47,000
I think she's the one desperate for you.

1501
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,900
Don't call after the first day, you know?

1502
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,160

1716
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,000
Okay, you better be dead.

1717
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:25,760
Because there's still two.

1718
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,180
Oh, there's one.

1719
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:26,980
There's that guy too.

1720
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:33,040
That's him just going to shank him in the ass.

1721
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:34,380
Yeah.

1722
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:35,480

01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,480
See, this is why I need a headshot.

1730
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:57,380
I'll re-equip your suppressor as well.

1731
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:59,320

1732
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,820

He might.

1796
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:12,120
I think there's a guy to your right.

1797
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:14,320
Yeah.

01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:15,180
Nah.

01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,620
I don't think so.

1800
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,560
No.

1801
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:20,880
Okay.

01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:22,160
Oh, hey.

1804
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,600
If you blow this up, their comms will be bad.

1805
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,440
Oh, that's good.

1806
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,760
Okay, I'll throw a grenade in there.

1807
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1808
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:31,560
I'll be fine, right?

1809
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,540
If I throw a grenade in there?

1810
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:33,940
Should be fine.

1811
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,240
I'm going to stay up here and then...

1812
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,640
Boop.

1813
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,200
Do you need to know?

1814
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:43,060
Oh.

1815
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:43,720
Is it broken?

1816
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:44,320
Yeah, I told you there was a grenade.

1817
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,180
there was a guy over there.

1818
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,380
Wait, is it broken though?

1819
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:47,780
It looks like it.

1820
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:48,920
Can't tell.

1821
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,660
No, I think it's still...

1822
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:55,420
It doesn't look broken.

1823
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,040
Oh, no, it's still working.

1824
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:56,460
Yeah.

1825
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:56,720
Weird.

1826
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,420
Well, I thought you could blow this up.

1827
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,220
Why isn't it work?

1828
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:03,020
Yeah.

1829
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,600
Maybe it's a TNT also for this, too.

1830
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:05,680
I think so, too.

1831
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,740
Oh, there he is.

1832
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,840
There you go.

1833
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,440
I think that's their food shed here, so if you blow this one
up.

1834
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,120
Oh, yeah, free food!

1835
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:23,500
And then if you if you blow this up then they'll be hungry
and they won't like work as well oh nice okay oh no this is

1836
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:30,820
their weapons win never mind nice but yeah same same kind of
idea you just want to like blow these up you want to blow

1837
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:41,920
this up okay so they will have lack of guns well i think
it's the tnt though isn't it oh i blew up the door yeah i

1838
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,500
don't think i don't think we're anywhere

1839
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:49,820
I do have TNT, yeah.

1840
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:50,940
Wait, apparently I do have TNT.

1841
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:51,380

1842
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,380
Wait, when did you get it?

1843
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,900
I don't even remember when I got TNT.

1844
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:54,740
Oh, there it is.

1845
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,760
Oh, there it is, yeah.

How many TNTs do I have?

1847
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,220
Uh, we'll build comms first.

1848
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:01,020
Put it in your inventory.

1849
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,780
You have five.

1850
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,060
How do I activate it?

1851
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:09,980

1852
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,560

It'll tell you.

Give me a sec.

1861
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,400

01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:39,200
What do you mean?

1869
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,060
You have to be close.

1870
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:41,160
It's an explosive.

1871
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,000
Oh, my God!

1872
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:46,470
It didn't work!

1873
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:52,790
That's door.

You were reading the door.

1875
01:38:59,110 --> 01:38:59,410
Yeah.

1876
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:01,410
Oh my god.

1877
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:02,510

It has to be close.

1883
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:10,370
Yeah.

1884
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:11,650
Yeah.

1885
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:14,090
We did it.

1886
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:20,330
Now there should be a shed that hides like more food and
more ammo.

1887
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:22,050
Like more TNT and stuff, too.

1888
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:23,350
Unless you already grabbed it.

1889
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:25,110
Alright.

1890
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:25,850
Someone said, why, why?

1891
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:28,270
Someone said, only food shed you can destroy.

1892
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:29,650
Sure?

1893
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:31,910
Oh, you can't destroy these ones?

1894
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:32,390
Are you sure?

1895
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:33,610
But the comms.

1896
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:36,190
The food.

1897
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:37,010
Oh, it's this one.

1898
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:37,910
That's the food shed.

1899
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:38,630
Yeah.

1900
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,810
Let's start a famine.

1901
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:43,570
Calorie, man.

1902
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,710
Alright.

Let's go.

1904
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:46,350
Oh, wait.

1905
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:46,830
There's one more.

1906
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:47,630
Oh, there's rats.

1907
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:48,830
Oh, my God.

1908
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:49,770
Let's go.

1909
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:50,830
Alright.

1910
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:53,730
Okay, the south side here instead of next to.

Yeah, you guys are.

1914
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:57,390
I'm getting my games wrong.

1915
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:57,910
Yeah.

1916
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,590
Oh, my gosh.

1917
01:39:59,670 --> 01:40:00,030
Oh, my God.

1918
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:01,190
I killed the rats, too.

1919
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,750
Yeah.

1920
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:03,950
Free rat meat.

1921
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:05,430
Rat meat.

1922
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:06,810
All right.

1923
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:07,770
That should be everything.

1924
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:09,730
No, go inside, too.

1925
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,190
Go inside.

1926
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:11,510
Yeah.

1927
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:15,580
What are you doing?

1928
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:16,540
Knock, knock.

1929
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:19,800
I thought it jumped through the window.

1930
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:20,700

01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:52,660

Oh, my God.

1943
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:00,600
I could be a scientist.

1945
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:04,580
You'll never know now.

Now they won't know.

1947
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,140

01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,020
Nah, they're gonna know.

1949
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,020

Yeah, I think they'll know.

1951
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,480
I'm part of the team.

1952
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,140
Look, I even have glasses on.

1953
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,100

01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,280
You want to shoot a guy with glasses.

1970
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:19,220
By the way, you can't use your gun while you're a scientist.

1971
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:20,560
I can't use a gun!

1972
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:21,040

1990
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,840
Oh, here he goes.

Oh, there he goes.

Oh, there he goes.

Oh, he actually learned.

No, he's got to keep going.

2002
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:31,620
He's got to keep going.

2003
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:37,520
That's twirl for every, like five twirls for every shot.

2004
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:43,980
This time I've got 12 shots.

The thrill.

2018
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,920
The thrill of reloading a battle.

2019
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,240
Watch him do it.

2020
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:43,600

2029
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:56,980

Oh, my God, there's a cat.

2047

2049
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:25,350
A cat?

01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:26,750
Is that what you just call it?

2051
01:45:28,050 --> 01:45:29,530
Is he reloading yet?

2052
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,050

One, two, three.

2057
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:48,790
It's so exhilarating.

2058
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:52,350
Oh, my God.

2059
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:56,830
I like how I just let him reload too.

2060
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:57,290
I know.

2061
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:02,710
Let him realize.

2062
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,770
He's aura farming.

2063
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:07,070
Damn it.

2064
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:09,450
He found us.

2065
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:11,450
Oh, it's the bee man!

2066
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:13,850
Not the bees!

2067
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:22,230
It was exhilarating.

2068
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:24,150
I got that!

2069
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:29,400
Okay, these bees are weak as shit.

2070
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:36,920
Just fucking peace waters.

2071
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:39,240
Oh shit.

2072
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,020
Oh, it's very serious.

2073
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:40,740
Ew.

2074
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:42,960
Ew.

2075
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:43,680
Ew.

2076
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:44,460
Not the bees!

2077
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,220
Not the bees!

2078
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:54,110
Just shoot him!

2079
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:55,290
Why would you just stand there?

2080
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:56,210
Like leave.

2081
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,070
Yeah, why are you watching?

2082
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:00,370
Oh my god.

2083
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:03,650
There's a bee stupid or something.

2084
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:05,390
Just sing him for a bye.

2085
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:07,730
He's really stupid.

2086
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,690
You were lucky.

2087
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:12,130
Bro, he's parrying.

2088
01:47:12,730 --> 01:47:14,150
He's parrying the bees.

2089
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:22,260
Snake!

2090
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:24,460
No, snake!

2091
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,220
Gabe, this is amazing.

2092
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,020
What the fuck?

2093
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:37,160
Damn.

2094
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,740
Those parries were sick, though.

2095
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:40,840
Yeah.

2096
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:43,300
Oh, oh my god, wait, were you...

2097
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,120
You didn't shoot him with your suppressor on, did you?

2098
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:45,980
I have it off.

2099
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:46,420
Oh, never mind.

2100
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:47,000
You still have one.

2101
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:48,380
Yeah, yeah.

2102
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,020
Oh, oh, oh, I can move.

2103
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:52,320
Yeah, you're in the dark.

2104
01:47:52,320 --> 01:48:02,300
it was a cutscene no i was like this is a very long cutscene

2109
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:50,540

guide me through this uh well you do have a map have a map

2110
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:57,540
oh yeah You're getting the map tutorial right now.

2111
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:00,720
I was like, oh, yeah.

2112
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,320
There's like a ton of loot in here, though.

2113
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,480
So you're going to want to, like, search thoroughly.

2114
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,220
Wait, maybe if I...

2115
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,180
Oh, I can see now.

2116
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:08,620
Oh, wait.

2117
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,380
I can see here.

2118
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,000
Wait, my eyes adjusted.

2119
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,520
No, that's just daylight.

2120
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:15,980
There has to be stuff here.

2121
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:18,300
Right?

2122
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:20,980
Your oxygen.

2123
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:21,700
Oh, no.

2124
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,940
But there's a cave, though.

2125
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,200
How do I get back up?

2126
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:34,600
okay there you go there you go oh my god that was scary okay
i gotta eat again i gotta pee i'll be okay i was gonna call

2127
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:48,360
someone anyway uh okay who do oh i should call my dad hey
dad i'm in the cave now snake are you okay snake major snake

2128
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:56,200
oh my god dad was worried about me no that was a hell of a
He actually cares!

2129
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,500
There's no way back up, though.

2130
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:58,500
I see.

2131
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,700
Well, anyway, it's good to hear you're not injured.

2132
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:05,000
Slipping and falling may not have been part of the plan, but
getting into that cave was.

2133
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,900
Proceed further into the cave.

2134
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:10,600
The cave seems to be structured like a maze, but there's an
exit somewhere.

2135
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,280
Find a way out of the cave and head for the aqueduct.

2136
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,200
Oh, right.

2137
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,920
But it might take me a while to get through this cave.

2138
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,220
Are you hurt?

2139
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:19,020
No.

2140
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:20,300
Is it the enemy?

2141
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:21,680
Did they set a trap for you?

2142
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:23,980
It's a very scary cave.

2143
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:26,500
It's dark in here.

2144
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,800
I'm scared of the dark, Dad.

2145
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,480
I should have brought a flashlight with me.

2146
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,500
So what you're saying is that it's going to take you a while
because you don't have a flashlight.

2147
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,400
Right.

2148
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:41,620
Snake, if you don't have a flashlight, you should be looking
for a substitute.

2149
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,060
A substitute?

2150
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:46,600
American soldiers these days rely too much on ready-made
equipment.

2151
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,840
Wait, what substitute?

2152
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:49,780
What was that?

2153
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:50,760
Nothing.

2154
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,340
American soldiers rely too much on ready-made equipment.

2155
01:50:54,360 --> 01:51:00,580
equipment well not only that they can't seem to grasp that
one piece of equipment can have multiple functions what back

2156
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:06,380
when i was in the sas we never had that problem we were
trained to use every piece of equipment wait so what

2157
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:15,100
equipment can i use then you don't have a flashlight look
for something else americans am i right hey are you

2158
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:22,020
listening to me yeah of course i am first take a look at
what you're carrying with you now don't you have anything

2159
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:32,460
that can provide you with some light what what gives me
light i see you've captured an indian gavial the indian

2160
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:39,300
gavial is a crocodile that originally lived in freshwater
regions in india and nepal bullets why are indian crocodiles

2161
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:47,680
way out here oh man there's so much stockpile of dialogue
because i haven't talked to my new mom gavials are large

2162
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:55,780
creatures adult males grow to over six meters in land no one
can replace my mom even if you use the tranquilizer gun i

2163
01:51:55,780 --> 01:52:03,480
tried the meat it was great well good for you but be careful
when capturing an indian gavel normally they're cowardly

2164
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:11,180
creatures but the ones in the forest there are belligerent
apparently they attack humans what do you mean they weren't

2165
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:16,640
the direct subject of any serious research but some think
they may have become violent as a side effect of the atomic

2166
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:24,540
research that was oh we're scared we're scared of people now
Oh, what does Eva think?

2167
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:25,980
Snake, are you alright?

2168
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:28,120
Yeah, just barely.

2169
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,360
What the hell were all those hornets?

2170
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:33,360
Most likely that was the pain one of the Cobras.

2171
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:35,260
I figured as much.

2172
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:36,740
Are they tracking me?

2173
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:37,900
I don't know.

2174
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,560
The Cobras only take orders from the boss.

2175
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,660
Not even Vulgan knows what they're really up to.

2176
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,080
So I don't know anything about that.

2177
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,940
She does care!

2178
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,080
My mom cares!

2179
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,860
She's sent in the pain to help me!

2180
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,280
Yeah.

2181
01:52:52,840 --> 01:53:01,220
oh my god i knew it i knew mom didn't disown me i knew i was
part of i'm still part of the disciples it's a test it's a

2182
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:11,100
test to see if i truly want to work for russia good i did
remember to tell you then if it's completely dark and you

2183
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:17,880

emergency torches stored somewhere in that cave torches got

2184
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:24,760
it i knew it guys where are the torches Wait, there's
torches?

2185
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:26,800
Oh, I can find torches.

2186
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,480
Okay, that's good to know, actually.

2187
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:30,660
Q-tips.

2188
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:33,320
Oh, it does.

2189
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:34,600
Okay, oh, cigar.

2190
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:38,120
Okay, cigar, night vision goggles, and a torch.

2191
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,720
Oh, my God, my eyes do a...

2192
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:42,780
Oh, my God, that's actually crazy that your eyes actually do
adjust to it.

2193
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:46,060
That's actually crazy.

2194
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,600
That it does work like that.

2195
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:52,320
Alright.

2196
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,880
Just gotta...

2197
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:56,260
Just gotta smoke a cigar real quick.

2198
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:00,700
Okay, this way.

2199
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:01,800
Is that...

2200
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:02,740
What does the map say?

2201
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,840
Okay, I'm going...

2202
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,040
Further away from the objective.

2203
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,000
You got this?

2204
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:09,320
I'm gonna go get water.

2205
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,300
Yeah, I got...

2206
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:16,280
Apparently, I can use my cigar to light up the caves.

2207
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,800
Wait, which I should equip my cigar then.

2208
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,680
Do I have the cigar equipped?

2209

Nope.

2214
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:57,900
I gotta light my cigar.

2215
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:01,540
We cannot smoke while wearing a hat.

2216
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,180
What?

2217
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:04,880
Okay, it's fine.

2218
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:07,720
Oh, look at all the rats.

Oh my god, I can sit on my little rat trap.

Wait, who's calling me?

2221
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,460
Oh, no one's calling me.

Okay.

01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:25,470
Did you know smoking kills and it's not healthy for you,
apparently?

2240
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:27,110
What?

2241
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:28,550
Yeah, that's crazy.

2242
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:29,990
Snakes should start vaping.

2243
01:56:30,290 --> 01:56:31,490
But also, it's also unhealthy.

2244
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:33,230
What is this, 1984?

2245
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:34,150
Come on.

2246
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:37,370
Telling us to not smoke.

2247
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:39,770
Yeah, wasn't it back then?

2248
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:43,570
They had like ads for kids to start smoking or some shit?

2249
01:56:44,110 --> 01:56:44,110
Probably.

2250
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:47,870
I remember back then they were like, don't worry kids, it's
okay.

2251
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:49,590
Guys, smoking is not good, guys.

2252
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:51,270
Don't smoke.

2253
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:51,850
Yeah, we're kidding.

2254
01:56:52,030 --> 01:56:52,430
Don't smoke.

2255
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:53,210
We're kidding.

2256
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:54,110
We're kidding, guys.

2257
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:58,330
Also vaping is also as addictive as smoking.

2258
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:01,530
So like, because they have like bubble gum flavor.

2259
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:03,370
Bubblegum?

2260
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:06,190
Yeah, bubblegum flavie.

2261
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:11,750
I don't think that's why people get addicted because of the
nicotine.

2262
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:21,490
I mean, I think it's... I think because they invented
bubblegum flavie, they made it much more... Oh my god, is

2263
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:22,070
that frog?

2264
01:57:22,330 --> 01:57:22,630
Nice.

2265
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:24,890
That was a... What do I do with live animals?

2266
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:29,250
So with, like, snakes, you can throw them at guards and
scare them.

2267
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:30,070
I got a rat.

2268
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:31,930
Oh, okay.

2269
01:57:32,150 --> 01:57:33,190
What do I do with a rat?

2270
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:37,450
Ah, maybe the same thing.

2271
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:38,710
They might be like, you a rat.

2272
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:39,390
Wait, I can...

2273
01:57:39,390 --> 01:57:41,190
Okay, I'm gonna see if I can throw a rat, then.

2274
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:42,870
Where's my live rat?

2275
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:43,630
Oh, there it is.

2276
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:44,310
Oh.

2277
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:45,710
Oh, my God.

2278
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:47,110
Okay, I gotta go throw this rat.

2279
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:48,910
Okay.

2280
01:57:49,550 --> 01:57:50,550
He's now a weapon.

2281
01:57:53,210 --> 01:57:59,970
You can also throw expired food and stuff or things that you
know are poisonous and if they eat it, they'll get sick.

2282
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:13,300
she's like i just want to shoot them in the head yeah i just
want i was like make them get sick i'm not here for the long

2283
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:28,280
term it's pretty immediate but you know is that safe yeah
that looks safe right yeah that seems safe that's totally

2284
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:34,240
safe yeah i believe you It was safe.

2285
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:38,340
I knew you wouldn't lie to me like all the other times.

2286
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:39,280
You definitely didn't lie.

2287
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:40,260
Oh, wait, that's a beetle.

2288
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,000
That's a crab.

2289
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:42,660
That's not a beetle.

2290
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:49,740
Technically, crabs are the spotters of the oceans.

2291
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:51,880
So I almost got it, right?

2292
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:53,600
Did you know that?

2293
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:57,000
I didn't lie to you when I told you to let your eyes adjust
to the darkness.

2294
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:01,900
There has to be a quicker way to, like, swap to that map.

2295
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:07,520
Oh, hey, look at all these spotters.

2296
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:10,100
Oh, nice.

2297
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:10,980
Okay, there's the torch.

2298
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:13,300
You found it!

2299
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:14,600
You found the torch!

2300
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:15,780
Okay, I got it.

2301
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,340
I got it.

2302
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:20,200
Start stabbing these crabs.

2303
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:23,700
Yeah, there's the sea spotters of the ocean.

2304
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:25,760
No.

2305
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:26,980
Yeah, they are.

2306
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:28,100
That's what crabs are.

2307
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:31,500
Okay, I'm hungry.

2308
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:47,360
else i know isn't it great to just kill them all and eat
them up wait i can eat them alive oh you could yeah wait

2309
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:55,280
okay wait is there any difference between eating them alive
or eating them like not alive i mean he eats them raw so

2310
01:59:55,280 --> 02:00:01,620
what do you think like regardless yeah like i'm just saying
like is there any health benefits to eating them while

2311
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:11,460
they're still alive and you know maybe they're juicier yeah
because like oh they don't spoil when alive oh that's smart

2312
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:21,140
actually that's actually pretty smart is that well you just
gotta eat your food before next week yeah and it's fresher

2313
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:28,700
too yeah because like you know how they say like the fresher
the fresher the meat the juicier it is yeah that's why i

2314
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:35,920
said it's probably juicy yeah So how fresh can you be unless
it's like a newborn?

2315
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:36,900
That's the freshest.

2316
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:41,480
Oh, that's, that's why people eat veal, like baby deers, or
no, baby cows.

2317
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:42,560
Yeah.

2318
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:46,220
Yeah, eat them when they're babies because the meat is more
tender.

2319
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:47,520
That's the freshest.

2320
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,240
Wait, how, what do babies taste like?

2321
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,580
You know how people always say talk about human meat?

2322
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:53,380
Oh.

2323
02:00:53,660 --> 02:00:57,020
And then, like, human meat, people, like, because, you know,
because, like, I don't know.

2324
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:57,720
You ever been curious?

2325
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:58,940
Have you ever, like, read articles?

2326
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:02,600
I mean, like, people ask cannibals, like, oh, what does
human meat taste?

2327
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:10,260
like and stuff and then like a pork or something they it's
like more like grainy apparently because like the meat the

2328
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:18,400
meat is more tough you know it's not as soft uh so it's
apparently like more grainy so i'm like why don't you use

2329
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:25,880
the torch why don't you use my eyes adjusted to the cave i
can't see anything your chat can't see anything i see

2330
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:32,240
there's the sun there's Guys, for legal reasons, it's a
joke.

2331
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,160
Don't eat babies.

2332
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,360
You can eat baby animals, though.

2333
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:41,460
That's what Ville is.

2334
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,000
Ville is so good, though.

2335
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:43,640
I'm not Ville.

2336
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:46,340
Oh, NVG.

2337
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:49,960
Yeah, you can do that here, too.

2338
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:51,920
See, that's what the battery's for.

2339
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,740
That's literally what I told you.

2340
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,140
No, that's not.

2341
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:57,220
I don't remember that.

2342
02:01:57,980 --> 02:01:58,460
That's not.

2343
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,280
Oh, there's the frog.

2344
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:03,560
No, didn't hear it.

2345
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:07,700
Wait, why do they associate cannibalism with you?

2346
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:10,420
What have you talked about?

2347
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:11,600
Oh, because...

2348
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,000
Nothing?

2349
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:13,760
God, stop telling her!

2350
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:14,540
What did you tell?

2351
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:15,720
What did you talk about?

2352
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:16,140
Wait.

2353
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:21,460
Why are you talking about cannibalism with you?

2354
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:29,140
Because there's like, I have a plan of like, eating certain
people, and, like, I have a list of people that I want to

2355
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:31,860
eat and I've been like kind of planning this.

2356
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,680
Wait, where am I on the list?

2357
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:38,120
Well, that's why I didn't want people to bring it up.

2358
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:40,220
I'm not even on the list?

2359
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,800
You don't know where you're on the list.

2360
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:44,940
Where am I?

2361
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,100
Where am I on the list?

2362
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:48,260
Oh my god, it leads me back here.

2363
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,500
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

2364
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:53,380
The yellow dot.

2365
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:54,880
I went everywhere.

2366
02:02:56,020 --> 02:02:57,720
The thing that says objective.

2367
02:02:57,980 --> 02:02:59,600
Oh my god, where am I?

2368
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:03,340
Okay, but like, I'm like a chicken.

2369
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,860
So like I should be on, like high on the list, right?

2370
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:09,400
Well, okay, there's other people that are like more chicken
than you, I'm just saying.

2371
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:11,820
I'm literally like a chocobo.

2372
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:14,500
How is there, how are they more chicken than me?

2373
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,540
A chocobo is like peak chicken.

2374
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:17,540
Because they're bigger.

2375
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,040
You are a crow.

2376
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:21,840
Okay, no, that's croaky.

2377
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:24,280
That's different.

2378
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:26,900
Also like pigeons are so good.

2379
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:27,860
I've never had pigeon before.

2380
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:39,400
no they're really good they're not crows but they're they're
they're sort of like crows yeah they're tasty wait can you

2381
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:47,960
eat chocobo in like in final fantasy i feel like you should
be allowed to is it like is it like how in pokemon there's

2382
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:54,400
like the illegal like no you can you can you can eat pokemon
they just don't show they they like you can eat magic carb

2383
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,380
technically but like It's apparently not as good because
the...

2384
02:03:57,380 --> 02:04:01,300
I know, but there's like the illegal slow-poke tail trading,
you know?

2385
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:06,400
You know, so is it kind of similar where some people eat
chocobos, but it's like...

2386
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:10,300
I feel like it's like exotic dining, so you have to like go
to like...

2387
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:15,180
You have to like go to those illegal restaurants for it.

2388
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:19,680
Like, like the very rich, only the very rich can access.

2389
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:24,860
Like if you have the money, you can like be allowed in those
restaurants.

2390
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:30,920
like it's like eating a pet like it's just i mean i guess
some people you can eat you know that's what wild animals

2391
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:38,040
are yeah or they could be like you know how the they had the
milk tank form and so what do they do with the milk tanks

2392
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:49,360
when they're too old i mean or they don't yeah you know i i
get it yeah probably probably and where are you i don't oh

2398
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:28,820
All right, there we go.

2399
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:30,300
Now I can see.

2400
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:32,540
Now you can see.

2401
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:34,200
Barely.

2402
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:39,560
Better than before.

2403
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:42,580
Okay, it's this way.

2404
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:47,980
There has to be like a quick section to just...

2405
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:49,340
A quick section.

2406
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:53,080
There's like something over here.

2407
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:53,860
You see that?

2408
02:05:54,860 --> 02:05:55,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

2409
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:56,920
Yeah.

2410
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:01,630
Oh my gosh.

2411
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:02,510
I have a compass.

2412
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:04,210
I forgot about that.

2413
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:05,190
Oh, no, my gosh.

2414
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:05,410
Oh, my God.

2415
02:06:05,530 --> 02:06:06,750
You're hungry again.

2416
02:06:07,110 --> 02:06:07,110
I'm hungry.

2417
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:08,970
I'm going to eat the Russian ration.

2418
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:11,610
How much does that give me?

2419
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:12,510
That's so great.

2420
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:14,190
Oh, it's not great.

2421
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:14,910
I'm surprised.

2422
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:16,170
Those are nasty.

2423
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:16,970
They're gross.

2424
02:06:17,150 --> 02:06:18,510
What happens if I eat this?

2425
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:20,090
Am I going to get high?

2426
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,710
Try it and then...

2427
02:06:21,710 --> 02:06:22,030
Wait.

2428
02:06:22,510 --> 02:06:23,110
Oh, you're arguing.

02:06:24,350 --> 02:06:25,150
Pretty tasty.

2430
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:26,750
Oh, my battery charged.

What?

2434
02:06:28,810 --> 02:06:29,950
Oh, because of radiation.

2435
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:30,910
Let's go.

2436
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:41,710

neurotoxin in its fangs be careful if it bites you go into

2439

2443
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:51,710

because they're hoping you'll defend them because they're

2448
02:08:29,950 --> 02:08:33,930
like the most defenseless It's similar with dogs when they
look at you and they're like defend me.

2449
02:08:33,930 --> 02:08:38,750
I'm in I'm a vulnerable moment Yeah, I took my dog.

2450
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:49,510
I told my chabas I took my dog to a Nature park and a hawk
started circling him Yeah, so we're not going back there.

2451
02:08:49,870 --> 02:08:55,770
We're My god I literally saw a shadow of a hawk.

2452
02:08:55,810 --> 02:09:01,490
I was like, oh, there's a hawk and then flew back and like
flew back to us and they started circling us like dog while

2453
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:02,710
he was pooping.

2454
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:05,490
Oh my god.

2455
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:10,970
Yeah, but like dad looked at me in the eye while he was
pooping, while the hawk was circling him.

2456
02:09:11,570 --> 02:09:14,030
It's like, you better deal with this hawk.

2457
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:17,110
He's like, take it down.

2458
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:20,370
That's scary.

2459
02:09:20,630 --> 02:09:24,710
The carbonyl groups in the oxy-luciferin are initially in an
electrical excited state.

2460
02:09:25,370 --> 02:09:27,270
When they return to their base state, they give off...

2461
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:27,650
Science.

2462
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:29,170
Oh, there's mushroom tab.

2463
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:30,250

a mushroom that glows that right was bound to charge up my

2465
02:09:39,330 --> 02:09:45,210

that sometimes snake does things that really confuse her

Okay, okay, I haven't gone this way.

2472

02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:44,930
No, no, no.

2476
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:46,330
Yeah, yeah, this is a new dead guy.

2477
02:10:46,670 --> 02:10:47,550
Oh, I got bug juice.

2478
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:48,910
Bug juice.

2479
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:50,210
So many people die in this cave.

2480
02:10:50,330 --> 02:10:50,590
Oh, my God.

2481
02:10:50,650 --> 02:10:53,030
The one area I didn't fucking go was the right area.

Oh, my God.

2483
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:56,950
You mean...

Okay, I knew there was an easier way to look at the map.

I know you have so many bats.

2496
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:08,630
I'm all from...

2497
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:10,010
Oh, you're just gonna eat it.

2498
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:10,290
Okay.

2499
02:12:10,530 --> 02:12:11,450
What is this?

2500
02:12:11,570 --> 02:12:12,210
Oh no.

2501
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:13,410
It's bats.

02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:15,550
It's all bats.

2503
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:16,830
All bats.

2504
02:12:18,910 --> 02:12:19,370
What's that?

2505
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:20,070
Yeah.

2506
02:12:20,370 --> 02:12:22,090
It was AK-47 ammo.

2507
02:12:22,530 --> 02:12:24,030
Wait, was that a passageway?

2508
02:12:24,530 --> 02:12:24,870
Back there?

2509
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:26,090
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

2510
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:26,950
Before you go in there?

2511
02:12:27,190 --> 02:12:27,450
Yeah.

2512
02:12:28,330 --> 02:12:30,170
Was there a passage to your...

2513
02:12:31,650 --> 02:12:32,830
Wait, look at the map.

2514
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:35,330
Oh, let me look at the map for some reason.

2515
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:36,930
Oh, maybe I have to be out of here.

2516
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:38,230
Oh, hey.

2517
02:12:38,370 --> 02:12:38,890
Smoke G.

2518
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:39,670
Oh, see?

2519
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:42,610
It pays to explore.

2520
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:44,710
Just kidding.

2521
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:45,610
I think I didn't see anything.

2522
02:12:45,810 --> 02:12:46,170
You're good.

2523
02:12:46,770 --> 02:12:47,490
Alright, nice.

2524
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:51,710
Alright, off we go.

2525
02:12:52,190 --> 02:12:52,410
Uh-oh.

2526
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:53,810
See, it looks like it, but it's not.

2527
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:54,570
Maybe not.

2528
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:55,030
I don't know.

2529
02:12:55,770 --> 02:12:56,910
Oh, cutscene time.

2530
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:58,130
Yeah!

2531
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:00,150
Time for...

2532
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:03,910
This is my mom.

2533
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:05,550
It's not your mom.

2534
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:08,750
Oh, it's the bees.

2535
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:12,870
It's one of our friends.

2536
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:13,870
We're role playing.

2537
02:13:14,710 --> 02:13:15,830
I'm a crocodile.

2538
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:20,570
We do our little role play session.

2539
02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:24,010
Have fun with your first boss.

2540
02:13:24,270 --> 02:13:26,030
We are the sons of the boss.

2541
02:13:26,770 --> 02:13:27,810
Oh, shit.

2542
02:13:29,190 --> 02:13:30,230
It gave me.

2543
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:32,590
Oh my god, he's like, oh my god.

2544
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:34,530
That's his persona.

2545
02:13:35,890 --> 02:13:37,930
He's literally dressed as a bee too.

2546
02:13:38,150 --> 02:13:39,070
I know.

2547
02:13:44,530 --> 02:13:46,230
That's literally his persona.

2548
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:53,490
I wonder what Snake's name would be if he joined the Cobra
unit.

2549
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:55,710
He'd be like the baby.

2550
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:56,550
The baby.

2551
02:13:57,270 --> 02:13:58,170
Yeah, the baby.

2552
02:13:58,870 --> 02:14:00,010
Wait, oh shit.

2553
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:01,870
Oh my god, wait, what is he throwing?

2554
02:14:02,230 --> 02:14:03,110
What is he throwing?

2555
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:05,850
Is he throwing bees?

2556
02:14:08,430 --> 02:14:11,730
So yeah, you're gonna want to, like, dive to avoid the bees.

2557
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:14,210
Oh, that, okay.

2558
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:18,230
Yeah, you're gonna want to, like, swim to avoid them from
attacking you.

2559
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:20,810
Wee!

2560
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:24,790
Then you can go up and you're gonna shoot them.

2561
02:14:25,190 --> 02:14:25,730
Oh, I can.

2562
02:14:28,330 --> 02:14:28,770
Alright.

2563
02:14:31,070 --> 02:14:32,530
I'm not getting a little shot.

2564
02:14:33,710 --> 02:14:35,110
Is he protecting himself with that?

2565
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:36,690
Yeah, he is.

2566
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:37,930
Oh, okay.

2567
02:14:39,130 --> 02:14:40,570
What the fuck did he do?

2568
02:14:41,230 --> 02:14:43,930
It's like a sense that draws the bees.

2569
02:14:46,510 --> 02:14:46,990
Yeah.

2570
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:48,310

2583
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:05,190
Wait, what?

2584
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:06,170
Oh, my God.

2585
02:15:06,330 --> 02:15:06,490

02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:08,630
Okay, okay.

2587
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:09,430
That's illegal.

2588
02:15:09,630 --> 02:15:10,390
That's illegal.

2589
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:10,670
Right.

2590
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:11,150
That's it.

2591
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:12,470
That's it.

2592
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:13,050
That's it.

2593
02:15:13,410 --> 02:15:13,450
Tommy gun.

2594
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:15,650
I literally warned you.

2595
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:16,390
I said so.

2596
02:15:16,630 --> 02:15:17,410
I said that would happen.

2597
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:20,610
I didn't think you would actually fucking...

2598
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:20,710
What?

2599
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:21,350

2604
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:30,150
They're like stinging bees.

2605
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:31,230
They're like crazy bees.

2606
02:15:31,390 --> 02:15:35,550
Yeah, but the fucking bees are carrying fucking Tommy guns.

2607
02:15:35,650 --> 02:15:36,430
That ain't normal.

2608
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:39,530
How is it not normal?

2609
02:15:39,730 --> 02:15:40,450

Do you want to get a shotgun?

2694
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:33,220
There's a shotgun?

2695
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:34,020
Sure, yeah.

2696
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:35,600
Yeah, but it's back in the caves.

2697
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:36,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

2698
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:37,980
Like, what?

2699
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:41,100

Yeah, back in the caves.

02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:43,400
Are you okay?

2702
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:45,280
Wait, there's a hole here.

2703
02:20:45,860 --> 02:20:46,300
Yeah.

2704
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:47,920
Is it in this hole?

02:20:50,420 --> 02:20:51,700
What is in the hole?

2706
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:53,280
What's in the hole?

2707
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:55,160
Nothing.

2708
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:59,060
Okay, you could have said that before I fucking went in the
hole.

2709
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:02,100
Well, I wanted you to satiate your curiosity.

2710
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,460
Yeah, but now I'll never explore again.

2711
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:08,360
Because I know it's just a lie.

2712
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:08,980
Oh, what's there?

2713
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:09,720

2715
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:11,360
Oh, okay.

2716
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:13,540
Yeah, that's important.

02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:16,720
Is there something on that side?

2718
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:18,780
You see that side on the left?

2719
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:21,420

Yeah, I did!

2760
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:21,260
It was pretty good.

2761
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,080
And I just finished my fries.

2762
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:28,660
Shotgun is back and to the right through a tunnel, I
believe.

2763
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:33,420
Does anyone want to agree with that?

2764
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:36,040
All in favor say aye.

2765
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:41,440
Don't tell Doki I use this Membo Supa on you.

2766
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:43,020
Oh, well, oh.

2767
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:51,370
All right, I'm back.

2768
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:53,270
Hello.

2769
02:23:53,770 --> 02:23:54,110
All right.

2770
02:23:54,430 --> 02:23:57,210
So what the chat say was where the shotgun is.

2771
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:00,110
Oh, they said it was back through a tunnel.

2772
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:02,590
Oh, that is so helpful.

2773
02:24:03,250 --> 02:24:07,910
Like, with how many tunnels are in here?

2774
02:24:08,170 --> 02:24:09,490
Yeah, yeah, okay.

2775
02:24:10,510 --> 02:24:11,850
All right, which tunnel?

2776
02:24:13,730 --> 02:24:14,490
Which tunnel?

2777
02:24:14,810 --> 02:24:16,970
I feel like I went through all these tunnels.

2778
02:24:18,890 --> 02:24:21,130
Did you go through that really long one on the right?

2779
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:22,770
Which really long one?

2780
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:23,930

2781
02:24:24,750 --> 02:24:25,970
I went through all of these.

2782
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:28,790
Which tunnel could it be?

2783
02:24:30,730 --> 02:24:31,770
That's that one.

2784
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:33,110
What, the right side?

2785
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:33,850

The tunnels.

2791
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:40,770
What do the tunnels say?

2792
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:41,830
The tunnels.

2793
02:24:42,010 --> 02:24:42,310
The tunnels.

2794
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,380

Alright, this way.

2873
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:15,460
Here I'll go.

2874
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:16,840
Is this the right way?

2875
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:17,940
That has to be.

2876
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:18,760
Where else will we go?

2877
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:21,320
Yeah, see?

2878
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:23,580
Oh, wait.

He's like, I'll grab that.

2881
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:26,560
Don't fall.

2882
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:28,020
Why?

2883
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:30,880
You said... Are you lying about fall damage?

2884
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:32,320
I would never...

2885
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:33,620
Are you lying about fall damage?

2886
02:31:33,740 --> 02:31:35,240
Why do you not want me to fall, then?

2887
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:35,500
See?

2888
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:41,540
Oh, because look how deep it is you fall to the abyss yeah
but then i can tank it if there's no fall damage right

2889
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:47,980
unless someone was lying what if it's never ending what if
it's never ending there's no such thing it always ends no

2890
02:31:47,980 --> 02:32:01,020
look see this way yay i'm back out in russia yay the russian
swamps okay so what's really cool about this part is if you

2891
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:07,120
have the croc hat and crocsuit you can Oh, wait, really?

2892
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:08,440
Oh, because they don't see.

2893
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:11,040
Yeah, they just see a croc.

2894
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:12,660
Oh, nice.

2895
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:14,080
Wait, it's actually paid a win.

2896
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:16,840
Wait, can I just walk upright?

2897
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:18,280
Will they know if I walk upright?

2898
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:19,340
Probably.

2899
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:21,400
Oh, okay, so I just have to swim.

2900
02:32:21,940 --> 02:32:23,340
Oh, see, like, a crocodile.

2901
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:28,880
I was going to say, is this suspicious if I start walking
upright, you know?

2902
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:31,300
Why would it be suspicious?

2903
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:35,640
It would be like, this crocodile is walking up.

2904
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:44,000
on two lakes today it's probably because of the radiation
they're right i mean we did drop a nuclear bomb here earlier

2905
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:52,020
today so maybe it's just maybe there's one of the spooky
mutated crocs you know yeah evolution is happening before

2906
02:32:52,020 --> 02:33:04,160
our very eyes yeah oh oh oh oh oh yeah i hope it's just one
way i'm not missing anything right there's no there's two

2907
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:06,260
there's two areas to go too.

2908
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:07,880
Alright.

2909
02:33:08,600 --> 02:33:08,740
Oh.

2910
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:11,740
So once you're about here, you're like pretty...

2911
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:11,840
Oh.

2912
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:12,560
Yeah.

02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:15,440
So now you pick...

So right is the objective.

2924
02:33:25,900 --> 02:33:27,780

02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:29,160
Yeah, yeah.

2926
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:31,980

02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:32,520
Yeah.

2928
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:33,740
It's battle gear.

2929
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:35,120
Okay.

2930
02:33:35,300 --> 02:33:35,860
Never not.

2931
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:37,920

2932
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:39,780
Okay, okay.

2933
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:41,160

2934
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:43,360
Oh, wait.

2935
02:33:43,460 --> 02:33:44,160

2936
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,240
Yeah, you can just shoot that guy.

2937
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:48,960
I'm just a crocodile.

2938
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:50,740
Who's that guy?

2939
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:51,680

2940
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:52,080
Oh, wait.

2941
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:53,060

Oh, wait.

2987
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:15,320
How is this a sniper rifle?

Okay.

2991
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:20,040
No, no, that's a sniper rifle.

2992
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:22,360
All right.

2993
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:25,220
Guys, I had to deploy the information, but she doesn't know.

2994
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:27,480
No, no, no, no.

2995
02:36:27,640 --> 02:36:28,000
No, no.

2996
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,300
What do you mean by that?

2997
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:32,100
What do you mean by the river?

2998
02:36:33,220 --> 02:36:35,040
You're in the river literally right now.

2999
02:36:35,220 --> 02:36:44,120
Yeah, but there's clearly there's something going on
regarding me killing people and the river so there's a cool

3000
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:53,080
thing in this next scene in the next area that if you shoot
the old man you can totally avoid his his fight but i don't

3001
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:59,920
recommend that because his fight is really cool wait which
old man you remember the guy the old man with his eyes

3002
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:11,360
bugging out yeah yeah yeah so i could kill him all right i'm
gonna go kill him but i'm gonna go kill him i don't for some

3003
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:22,840
reason I'm not leaving that statement for some reason no it
really is it actually is you could save and then try it yeah

3004
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:33,800
because it's like I mean you probably could do it one shot
but the timing is kind of no I think you could do it oh my

3005
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:36,540
gosh pissy pants what

3006
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:49,100

Oh yeah, his future boyfriend.

Yeah, it's not graved anymore.

3029
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:30,470
But his older guns were cooler.

3030
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:32,410
It's not about the style.

3031
02:39:33,010 --> 02:39:33,290
No.

3032
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:35,010

Go change his pants.

02:40:56,390 --> 02:40:59,230
And his mistress saw him be a little bitch too.

Mommy, I did well though, did not.

3061

02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:20,960
Oh, man.

The pain.

3068
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:37,280
He exploded.

Oh, shit.

3070
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:49,070

Normally, he's dead.

3082
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:55,780

Wait, what does he mean by that?

3089
02:43:43,490 --> 02:43:44,010
Kuobara.

3090
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:48,360
Kuobara.

3091
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:50,360
Mommy, I killed your six Pokemon.

3092
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:51,780
Can I join your team now?

3093
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:53,500
Yes, of course.

3094
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:54,880
Is that what you meant?

3095
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:55,720
Yeah, yeah.

3096
02:43:58,400 --> 02:43:59,440
The sorrow.

3097
02:43:59,700 --> 02:44:00,280
Is that you?

3098
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,120
Oh, R1.

3099
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:05,460
You missed it.

3100
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:06,100
Oh, no!

3101
02:44:14,380 --> 02:44:16,040
Yeah, it's a Nuzlocke.

3102
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:17,960
Yeah, it's, yeah.

3103
02:44:20,120 --> 02:44:21,360
All right, now you can kill him.

3104
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:24,700
Wait, save first before you do it.

3105
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:25,180
All right.

3106
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:26,240
Yeah.

3107
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:27,240
Oh, wait.

3108
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:28,760
I have to keep forgetting if they call.

3109
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:29,780
You gotta call Parametic, yeah.

3110
02:44:30,060 --> 02:44:31,420
It's been a while since I called.

3111
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:36,300
Yeah, it's been a while.

3112
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:37,380
Yeah.

3113
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:39,140
Save, please.

3114
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:41,300
I'll do a new data just in case.

3115
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:42,340
Yeah, do a new one, yeah.

3116
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:43,920
Have you seen 007 from...

3117
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:44,480
Oh, Jason.

3118
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:45,140
James Bond.

3119
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:47,060
Nah, I don't like those movies.

3120
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:49,440
Real spies are nothing like James Bond.

3121
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:50,500
It's pure fantasy.

3122
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:51,680
Yeah, not like me.

3123
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:52,380
I'm real.

3124
02:44:52,840 --> 02:44:53,360
You're real.

3125
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:58,060
And even though it's fiction, I can't help but comparing
myself to Bond.

3126
02:44:58,820 --> 02:44:59,260
He feels...

3127
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:01,640
Is it because he's British?

3128
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:02,600
The cars?

3129
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:03,160
The guns?

3130
02:45:03,560 --> 02:45:04,000
Hey, Jar.

3131
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:05,680
Hey, Jar.

3132
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:07,200
Wouldn't you like a gun shaped like a pen?

3133
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:09,920
Look, what is a pen gonna do me in the jungle?

3134
02:45:10,300 --> 02:45:10,960
I'd look like a fool.

3135
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:11,640
Exactly.

3136
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:13,020
I ain't no fool.

3137
02:45:13,340 --> 02:45:14,320
He is practical.

3138
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:15,040
Yeah.

3139
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:16,080
Yeah.

3140
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:17,120
Go ahead.

3141
02:45:17,220 --> 02:45:19,280
Get a shot in on the enemy while they're distracted.

3142
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:21,580
Okay, now you're being ridiculous.

3143
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:24,800
We'll make you a snake-shaped gun that folds off.

3144
02:45:25,540 --> 02:45:27,300
Okay, that actually looks sick as fuck.

3145
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:28,100
I like that.

3146
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:29,820
I want a snake-shaped gun.

3147
02:45:29,860 --> 02:45:30,240
How would you?

3148
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:31,320
How would you shoot it?

3149
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:33,580
You like retract it.

3150
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:34,600
Oh!

3151
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:36,800
Yeah, so it's like a long-ass bazooka.

3152
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:39,080
I like the hanky-panky.

3153
02:45:39,380 --> 02:45:39,640
Oh.

3154
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:42,860
Snake doesn't have time for women.

3155
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:43,900
I mean, what about this evil?

Alright, let Grandpa go to sleep now.

02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:42,370
Grandpa can go to sleep now.

3176
02:47:43,030 --> 02:47:44,650
What if I couldn't...

3177
02:47:45,750 --> 02:47:47,890
Is it advised to do it stealthily?

3178
02:47:49,850 --> 02:47:50,890
No, never.

3179
02:47:51,210 --> 02:47:52,610
You never have to do any stealthily.

3180
02:47:52,950 --> 02:47:52,950
You're right.

3181
02:47:53,090 --> 02:47:55,550
Yeah, nothing related to the river too, apparently.

3182
02:47:57,770 --> 02:47:58,030
I don't know.

3183
02:47:58,130 --> 02:48:00,090
You're literally in the river right now.

3184
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:01,090
All right.

3185
02:48:02,050 --> 02:48:03,610

He's trying to wheel away, so funny.

3187
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:12,090

I know, right?

3194
02:48:52,810 --> 02:48:54,590
I wouldn't notice either.

3195
02:48:57,650 --> 02:48:59,490
Maybe he wasn't a good friend.

3196
02:49:02,330 --> 02:49:04,210
Oh, there you go.

3197
02:49:04,670 --> 02:49:05,090

That was so mad.

3208
02:49:22,030 --> 02:49:23,830
This floor is so slippery, guys.

3209
02:49:23,950 --> 02:49:24,370
Yeah.

3210
02:49:26,370 --> 02:49:28,410
It's so slippery.

3211
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:32,230
Um, smoke gee!

3212
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:34,570
Smoke gee every day.

02:49:35,530 --> 02:49:36,470
Smoke gee.

3214
02:49:37,310 --> 02:49:39,090
That word you won't say.

3215
02:49:39,190 --> 02:49:39,830
Yeah, that's right.

3216
02:49:40,070 --> 02:49:41,370
Yeah, that's lyric.

3217
02:49:42,990 --> 02:49:47,570
Ah, yes, the infamous Snoop Dogg lyric.

3218
02:49:50,570 --> 02:49:52,590

Smoke G every day.

3222
02:50:04,190 --> 02:50:05,710
Your G stands for grass.

3223
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:06,450
Yeah.

3224
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:08,890
Which, well, your ass is grass.

3225
02:50:09,610 --> 02:50:10,410
That's right, touch grass.

3226
02:50:10,430 --> 02:50:11,330
I'm going to smoke it.

3227
02:50:14,390 --> 02:50:16,410
Alright, I don't need any of this.

3228
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:20,030
Oh, wait.

3229
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:20,790
Oh, it was that?

3230
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:21,330
Oh, yeah.

3231
02:50:21,550 --> 02:50:22,830
A smoke tree in my brain.

3232
02:50:23,110 --> 02:50:23,810
What was that?

3233
02:50:24,390 --> 02:50:26,470
Oh, I think that's the poisonous spider, yeah.

3234
02:50:27,690 --> 02:50:28,850
That was a poisonous spider.

3235
02:50:28,850 --> 02:50:29,270
Why'd you kill him?

3236
02:50:31,170 --> 02:50:32,330
What are you beat?

3237
02:50:32,410 --> 02:50:33,570
You said it was poisonous!

3238
02:50:34,290 --> 02:50:37,250
He could have poisoned some guys.

3239
02:50:37,710 --> 02:50:38,330
What could you have done?

3240
02:50:38,510 --> 02:50:40,710
You could throw it at the guys and poison them.

3241
02:50:40,830 --> 02:50:41,290
It's alright.

3242
02:50:41,290 --> 02:50:41,830
It's fine.

3243
02:50:41,930 --> 02:50:43,470
How do I even catch the spot?

3244
02:50:43,630 --> 02:50:44,790
I don't have a fucking trap.

3245
02:50:45,590 --> 02:50:46,670
You have a trank.

3246
02:50:46,890 --> 02:50:47,790
No, I... Oh, yeah.

3247
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:48,310
Oh, wait.

3248
02:50:48,370 --> 02:50:48,970
They go to sleep.

3249
02:50:49,090 --> 02:50:49,490
I forgot.

3250
02:50:50,810 --> 02:50:53,330
I could... I could have made them go zzzz.

3251
02:50:54,150 --> 02:50:54,550
Alright.

3252
02:50:54,710 --> 02:50:56,050
There's some guys in here.

3253
02:50:56,390 --> 02:50:57,170
I don't see any.

3254
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:59,350
They're definitely there.

3255
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:03,160
They don't...

3256
02:51:03,160 --> 02:51:04,380
You don't want them here in your tummy.

3257
02:51:05,180 --> 02:51:05,360
Alright.

3258
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:08,440
I gotta refill my tummy real quick.

3259
02:51:09,100 --> 02:51:11,180
Do I need to be full HP for the... Oh, shit!

3260
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:13,120
Oh!

3261
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:13,900
Oh, fuck.

3262
02:51:14,020 --> 02:51:15,540
I told you there were guys in there.

3263
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:18,700
Okay, I did not realize they were right over here.

3264
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:20,080
Yeah, I told you.

3265
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:21,700

02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:43,540
Oh, shit.

3446
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:43,820
Yeah.

3447
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:44,020
Yeah.

3448
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:44,200
Okay.

3449
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:45,800
And then we.

3450
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:46,900
Oh, my God.

3451
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:47,200
Oh, wait.

3452
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:47,480
TNT.

3453
02:57:49,300 --> 02:57:52,120
No, apparently it doesn't work in this game.

3454
02:57:52,120 --> 02:57:53,300
Oh, wait, the food one does.

3455
02:57:53,320 --> 02:57:54,000
The food does.

3456
02:57:54,220 --> 02:57:54,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3457
02:57:54,760 --> 02:57:55,680
I remember food does.

3458
02:57:56,480 --> 02:57:58,600
All right, yeah, now they can starve.

3459
02:57:59,240 --> 02:57:59,680
Yeah.

3460
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:00,440
Oh,

3461
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:05,480
okay, that was a little close.

3462
02:58:05,900 --> 02:58:07,800
Oh, that's...

3463
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:08,180
Yeah.

3464
02:58:08,900 --> 02:58:09,820
There you go.

3465
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:11,460
All right.

3466
02:58:11,780 --> 02:58:12,060
Yeah!

3467
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:14,900
Did you get him?

3468
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:15,400
Did he go down?

3469
02:58:15,400 --> 02:58:16,080
Yeah, he's dead.

3470
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:16,640
He's dead, dead.

3471
02:58:17,180 --> 02:58:17,800
He's dead, dead.

3472
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:18,620
Yeah, he's dead dead.

3473
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:20,480
Yeah, blow it up.

3474
02:58:20,540 --> 02:58:23,080
Now they're going to be hungry when you come back through
here.

3475
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:23,320
Oh.

3476
02:58:24,700 --> 02:58:25,440
It's okay.

3477
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:29,880
Oh, don't worry.

3478
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:30,960
He'll come back up.

3479
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:33,400
Oh, there's like so much loot because of them.

3480
02:58:34,060 --> 02:58:34,940
Are they going to come up?

3481
02:58:35,240 --> 02:58:36,160
Come up the stairs.

3482
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:37,580
Oh, shit.

3483
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:38,100
Nice.

3484
02:58:38,860 --> 02:58:39,760
Holy shit.

3485
02:58:39,900 --> 02:58:40,200
Glad.

3486
02:58:41,960 --> 02:58:42,500
All right.

3487
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:45,180
There's no way there's more people.

3488
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:49,100
The entire Russian military is going to be down the one.

3489
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:52,440
I fucking got rid of the entire Russian military.

3490
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:54,120
There's no way.

3491
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:56,540
Man, please help us.

3492
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:58,080
I'm here for the vibes, guys.

3493
02:58:58,240 --> 02:58:58,740
This is how she...

3494
02:58:58,740 --> 02:59:00,760
I'm not going to back see how she plays the game.

3495
02:59:01,160 --> 02:59:01,880
What do you mean?

3496
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:02,660
Please help us.

3497
02:59:02,740 --> 02:59:04,140
Wait, what am I doing wrong?

3498
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:07,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3499
02:59:07,560 --> 02:59:08,520
What am I doing?

3500
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:09,020
You're not doing any...

3501
02:59:09,020 --> 02:59:09,440
You're not...

3502
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:11,160
You're playing the game exactly as you can.

3503
02:59:11,180 --> 02:59:11,860
What am I...

3504
02:59:11,860 --> 02:59:13,420
What am I doing wrong?

3505
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:14,160
Nothing.

3506
02:59:14,440 --> 02:59:14,980
What am I...

3507
02:59:14,980 --> 02:59:17,200
I'm a little worried now.

3508
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:18,260
No.

3509
02:59:18,260 --> 02:59:22,420
Oh, you literally, there's no wrong way to play this game.

3510
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:23,660
Wait, oh, oops, ointment.

3511
02:59:23,780 --> 02:59:25,960
Oh, oh, I didn't realize there was an animation.

3512
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:26,540
Oh, no.

3513
02:59:27,240 --> 02:59:27,740
It's a game.

3514
02:59:30,770 --> 02:59:31,690
All right, nice.

3515
02:59:32,830 --> 02:59:33,770
Oh, it was nothing.

3516
02:59:33,910 --> 02:59:34,390
A smoke G.

3517
02:59:35,770 --> 02:59:37,690
Smoke G every day.

3518
02:59:37,990 --> 02:59:39,050
Smoke G every day.

3519
02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:40,850
Oh, wait, there's no...

3520
02:59:40,850 --> 02:59:42,090
You have no suppressor anymore.

3521
02:59:42,170 --> 02:59:42,710
Yeah, I do.

3522
02:59:43,210 --> 02:59:43,930
Oh, now you do.

3523
02:59:43,970 --> 02:59:44,250
Nice, nice.

3524
02:59:45,930 --> 02:59:46,730
I mean...

3525
02:59:46,730 --> 02:59:48,030
It's nice and quiet.

3526
02:59:48,230 --> 02:59:49,190
Wait, I know what to do.

3527
02:59:49,790 --> 02:59:52,150
I have a do you want to try and get that thing up there?

3528
02:59:52,870 --> 02:59:53,810
What is it a good thing?

3529
02:59:54,710 --> 02:59:55,130
I don't remember.

3530
02:59:55,310 --> 02:59:57,710
I think it's a I think it's a suppressor.

3531
02:59:57,910 --> 02:59:58,510
What kind of thing is it?

3532
02:59:59,030 --> 02:59:59,630
I don't remember.

3533
03:00:00,550 --> 03:00:00,850
All right.

3534
03:00:01,730 --> 03:00:05,110
I'll do this and then since they keep giving me smoke G.

3535
03:00:05,550 --> 03:00:06,530
Wait, what's a chaff grenade?

3536
03:00:06,770 --> 03:00:07,590
Oh, it jams.

3537
03:00:08,090 --> 03:00:09,650
Yeah, jams are comms.

3538
03:00:11,490 --> 03:00:12,210
Oh, wait.

3539
03:00:12,410 --> 03:00:12,870
Oh, wait, no.

3540
03:00:14,190 --> 03:00:16,710
I'm going to do a stun grenade.

3541
03:00:18,350 --> 03:00:18,770
All right.

3542
03:00:19,630 --> 03:00:20,010
Oh, no.

3543
03:00:20,870 --> 03:00:21,670
Yeah, there you go.

3544
03:00:21,810 --> 03:00:22,330
There it is.

3545
03:00:22,770 --> 03:00:23,430
What is it?

3546
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:24,970
Or is it a camo?

3547
03:00:25,130 --> 03:00:25,810
I can't remember.

3548
03:00:27,570 --> 03:00:28,150
Look at that.

3549
03:00:29,270 --> 03:00:29,990
Oh, yeah.

3550
03:00:30,130 --> 03:00:30,850
It was a suppressor.

3551
03:00:30,990 --> 03:00:31,250
I knew it.

3552
03:00:31,390 --> 03:00:31,610
Oh, okay.

3553
03:00:33,310 --> 03:00:35,530
But it was for your other gun that you don't use.

3554
03:00:36,510 --> 03:00:37,330
All right, here we go.

3555
03:00:40,250 --> 03:00:41,410
What a hard puzzle.

3556
03:00:42,350 --> 03:00:43,030
I know, right?

3557
03:00:43,090 --> 03:00:43,690
I told you.

3558
03:00:45,050 --> 03:00:46,910
Oh, there's a camo in the other area.

3559
03:00:47,170 --> 03:00:48,250
Oh, where all the rats are.

3560
03:00:48,590 --> 03:00:48,950
Oh.

3561
03:00:49,770 --> 03:00:51,550
There's a lot of rats everywhere, though.

3562
03:00:54,330 --> 03:00:55,050
Yeah, it's...

3563
03:00:55,050 --> 03:00:55,510
All right.

3564
03:00:55,550 --> 03:00:55,970
It's fine.

3565
03:00:56,230 --> 03:00:57,110
Here I'll go.

3566
03:01:02,820 --> 03:01:05,740
I think, guys, she's only going to be using the croc, so,
you know.

3567
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:08,820
I don't think she really cares.

3568
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:10,020
Wait, what?

3569
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:11,140
Was I supposed to be a scientist?

3570
03:01:11,140 --> 03:01:13,320
There's a lot of traps in this area, so be careful.

3571
03:01:13,940 --> 03:01:14,240
It's alright.

3572
03:01:14,340 --> 03:01:16,060
They can't get me if I'm crawling.

3573
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:19,720
Right.

3574
03:01:23,890 --> 03:01:24,810
Can't get me.

3575
03:01:24,830 --> 03:01:26,190
Oh, hey, there's a magazine.

There you go.

3582
03:02:07,310 --> 03:02:08,190
No hesitation.

3583
03:02:08,870 --> 03:02:09,070
Yay.

3584
03:02:09,350 --> 03:02:09,950
Oh, and I got a serum.

3585
03:02:09,950 --> 03:02:10,910
Oh, I got ramen noodles.

3586
03:02:11,230 --> 03:02:12,630
Yeah, they give you serum too.

3587
03:02:12,950 --> 03:02:14,110
They gave me ramen noodles.

3588
03:02:15,270 --> 03:02:16,490
Yeah, the rabbit made that.

3589
03:02:16,710 --> 03:02:16,970
Yeah.

3590
03:02:17,170 --> 03:02:19,250
Did you know rabbit noodles come from rabbits?

3591
03:02:19,550 --> 03:02:21,730
From rabbits in Russia?

3592
03:02:22,190 --> 03:02:22,670
Yeah, yeah.

3593
03:02:23,250 --> 03:02:25,050
Especially Russian rabbits too.

3594
03:02:25,150 --> 03:02:26,010
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

3595
03:02:26,190 --> 03:02:28,250
Yeah, that's where they, that's where they make all the
ramen.

3596
03:02:28,250 --> 03:02:29,790
That's why it starts with R.

3597
03:02:30,410 --> 03:02:31,450
It was made there.

3598
03:02:31,610 --> 03:02:38,810
He was, it was like a rogue rabbit that like was a brainiac
guy and he invented it.

3599
03:02:42,270 --> 03:02:43,970
Okay, see, I got through the traps.

3600
03:02:45,110 --> 03:02:45,410
Yeah.

3601
03:02:46,130 --> 03:02:47,410
All the traps you got.

3602
03:02:47,590 --> 03:02:48,730
This is my stealth.

3603
03:02:50,810 --> 03:02:52,030
Finally, stealth.

3604
03:02:52,930 --> 03:02:54,990
Finally, what the P4 one is.

3605
03:02:55,310 --> 03:02:55,590
Stealth.

3606
03:02:56,230 --> 03:02:56,490
Yeah.

3607
03:02:57,430 --> 03:02:59,490
Nobody can complain anymore except here.

3608
03:02:59,830 --> 03:03:00,110
Oh, oh.

3609
03:03:00,610 --> 03:03:01,890
I knew that was coming.

3610
03:03:12,130 --> 03:03:16,250
I chose not to warn you to make you learn your lesson, Doki
Bird.

3611
03:03:16,850 --> 03:03:19,370
With what lesson I didn't learn anything?

3612
03:03:20,750 --> 03:03:22,390
What lesson was I supposed to...

3613
03:03:22,390 --> 03:03:24,450
Wait, do I have to get the items again, or are they...

3614
03:03:24,450 --> 03:03:25,290
I think so, yeah.

3615
03:03:26,830 --> 03:03:28,130
No, the magazine's not.

3616
03:03:28,390 --> 03:03:29,490
The magazine's gone.

3617
03:03:30,290 --> 03:03:30,850
Yeah, maybe you don't.

3618
03:03:30,990 --> 03:03:32,350
Maybe you're good.

3619
03:03:34,570 --> 03:03:36,210
Does he drop ramen noodles again?

3620
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:37,930
Uh, no more ramen noodles.

3621
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:39,490
I don't think he ever dropped the ramen noodles.

3622
03:03:41,150 --> 03:03:43,810
No, but I found ramen noodles there.

3623
03:03:45,110 --> 03:03:46,790
You should roll into those.

3624
03:03:48,070 --> 03:03:49,270
Oh, I'm hungry again.

3625
03:03:49,730 --> 03:03:50,750

What?

3671
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:03,360

3684
03:06:20,580 --> 03:06:21,960
Alright, other side.

3685
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:23,680

Wait, can I just cross under this or no?

3747
03:09:19,990 --> 03:09:21,330
No, you have to find a hole.

3748
03:09:22,170 --> 03:09:22,930
Oh, there's a hole.

3749
03:09:23,050 --> 03:09:26,070
That one you should have saved, though, because it doesn't
expire, but you know, whatever.

3750
03:09:26,970 --> 03:09:28,570
Oh, I think the dog's awake.

3751
03:09:28,830 --> 03:09:30,410
Wait, the dog can wake up?

3752
03:09:30,670 --> 03:09:31,910

3774
03:11:02,460 --> 03:11:02,960
It's kind of sad.

3775
03:11:03,880 --> 03:11:04,880
You can't pet the dog.

3776
03:11:05,020 --> 03:11:05,860
Nine out of ten.

3777
03:11:06,560 --> 03:11:08,080
Kojima, I can't believe it.

3778
03:11:08,140 --> 03:11:08,840
Didn't think of it.

3779
03:11:08,880 --> 03:11:11,520
He thought of everything, but he didn't think of everything.

3780
03:11:12,480 --> 03:11:14,420
You feel like he would think of that.

3781
03:11:14,440 --> 03:11:15,140
Yeah, I know, right?

3782
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:16,620

No, no, no.

3930
03:18:12,160 --> 03:18:13,100
That's how you play the game.

3931
03:18:13,240 --> 03:18:14,060
That's how you play the game.

3932
03:18:14,760 --> 03:18:16,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm learning new ways.

3933
03:18:16,120 --> 03:18:17,080
This guy's already dead.

3934
03:18:17,240 --> 03:18:18,540
This guy's already dead.

3935
03:18:18,980 --> 03:18:20,820
My sweater, Rob, is tough.

3936
03:18:22,020 --> 03:18:24,660
We're just learning new ways to play the game, guys.

3937
03:18:25,200 --> 03:18:29,520
Yeah, there's also, yeah, over there, there's like a little
shed full of stuff right there, yeah.

3938
03:18:30,220 --> 03:18:30,960
It's not food.

3939
03:18:31,220 --> 03:18:31,420
Oh.

3940
03:18:32,640 --> 03:18:33,400
Oh, it's loot.

3941
03:18:33,700 --> 03:18:34,220
Oh, it's TNT.

3942
03:18:34,300 --> 03:18:35,100
We need that, actually.

3943
03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:35,520
Oh!

3944
03:18:36,240 --> 03:18:37,080
Assault rifle.

3945
03:18:38,180 --> 03:18:38,440
Hmm.

3946
03:18:39,040 --> 03:18:40,280
But who needs that when you have a torch?

3947
03:18:40,440 --> 03:18:41,140
That's so true.

3948
03:18:41,220 --> 03:18:41,500
Oh my god.

3949
03:18:41,580 --> 03:18:42,620
I can CQC now.

3950
03:18:46,200 --> 03:18:49,420
So inside this building is where you're going to dress up as
a doctor.

3951
03:18:49,940 --> 03:18:50,340
A scientist.

3952
03:18:50,700 --> 03:18:54,020
Oh, I've only found out about the torch strat earlier.

3953
03:18:55,020 --> 03:18:55,280
Sorry.

3954
03:18:55,580 --> 03:18:56,480
I should have remembered.

3955
03:18:57,980 --> 03:19:00,360
There is a hole over there or you can go through the door.

3956
03:19:00,660 --> 03:19:02,400
Wait, what's the difference between the hole and the door?

3957
03:19:03,220 --> 03:19:04,760
You go in a different way.

3958
03:19:05,460 --> 03:19:07,920
Yeah, but I'm just going to be putting on a costume.

3959
03:19:08,560 --> 03:19:10,780
CQC, closed quarters, cremations.

3960
03:19:13,560 --> 03:19:14,960
The best way.

3961
03:19:15,800 --> 03:19:16,760
I'm going to go see the door.

3962
03:19:17,920 --> 03:19:18,980
I should just dress up as a...

3963
03:19:18,980 --> 03:19:19,400
But you got to change first.

3964
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:21,840
Yeah, I was going to say I had to dress up as a scientist
first.

3965
03:19:22,080 --> 03:19:22,480
Yeah.

3966
03:19:23,100 --> 03:19:23,560
All right.

3967
03:19:28,500 --> 03:19:30,700
Would it matter if I have my hat on?

3968
03:19:31,420 --> 03:19:32,940
Yeah, I think you got to take it off.

3969
03:19:33,140 --> 03:19:35,980
Oh, do you think they'll know if I have it on?

3970
03:19:38,400 --> 03:19:39,140
Can I?

3971
03:19:40,660 --> 03:19:41,180
Let's see.

3972
03:19:41,760 --> 03:19:42,520
Let's see.

3973
03:19:43,320 --> 03:19:44,720

I'm just skedaddle with me.

4159
03:29:07,340 --> 03:29:09,780
Because you're looking for Sokolov.

4160
03:29:10,200 --> 03:29:11,220
He's not here anymore.

4161
03:29:11,900 --> 03:29:12,560
Where'd he go?

4162
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:14,880
Huh.

4163
03:29:15,180 --> 03:29:16,620
Put that thing away.

4164
03:29:16,940 --> 03:29:18,280
Spoil my drink.

4165
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:19,820
I love Granon.

4166
03:29:21,340 --> 03:29:24,340
So, you're the intruder everyone's talking about.

4167
03:29:24,420 --> 03:29:25,020
It's me.

4168
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:26,020
Ooh, damn.

4169
03:29:26,740 --> 03:29:39,740
typical capitalist dog no manners oh he's an alcoholic oh
yeah you'll see you'll find out why never heard of me and

4170
03:29:39,740 --> 03:29:47,480
you'll call yourself an agent what is he oh he has a Gundam
in the back Gundam

4171
03:29:56,740 --> 03:30:06,280
I am the foremost weapon scientist in the Soviet Union and
the head of the glorious Gronin design bureau this is the

4172
03:30:06,280 --> 03:30:18,300
order of Lenin doesn't say that's Lenin given along with the
title of hero of socialism to only the finest workers it was

4173
03:30:18,300 --> 03:30:26,120
awarded to me in recognition of my brilliant contributions
to society now you're all washed up buddy since the great

4174
03:30:26,120 --> 03:30:36,460
patriotic war i have created countless weapons in the
service of our great communist society it was thanks to me

4175
03:30:36,460 --> 03:30:48,060
that we were able to stamp out the nazis scum damn he did
that who created the basic design for the mobile ballistic

4176
03:30:48,060 --> 03:30:54,080
missile oh and fear has ss1c

4177
03:30:57,260 --> 03:30:57,740
SS1C.

4178
03:30:59,300 --> 03:31:01,980
Why are you drinking if you're so proud of all that?

4179
03:31:05,820 --> 03:31:08,000
I'm merely drowning in my sorrow.

4180
03:31:09,580 --> 03:31:10,420
Because of him.

4181
03:31:11,260 --> 03:31:13,120
I've got nothing to do but sit here.

4182
03:31:14,480 --> 03:31:15,560
Oh, they did that.

4183
03:31:15,560 --> 03:31:16,120
They did that.

4184
03:31:16,300 --> 03:31:17,760
You know that Japanese practice?

4185
03:31:17,880 --> 03:31:20,220
If they're like too old, they can't fire them.

4186
03:31:20,320 --> 03:31:22,320
So they just isolate them in the office.

4187
03:31:22,940 --> 03:31:24,180
They basically did that.

4188
03:31:24,320 --> 03:31:26,520
It's him you're looking for, isn't it?

4189
03:31:26,620 --> 03:31:28,260
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

4190
03:31:28,340 --> 03:31:30,060
Yeah, they were like...

4191
03:31:30,060 --> 03:31:31,740
I have been stripped of my authority.

4192
03:31:32,200 --> 03:31:33,780
My research has come to nothing.

4193
03:31:34,940 --> 03:31:35,280
Look.

4194
03:31:38,220 --> 03:31:39,240
His research.

4195
03:31:39,700 --> 03:31:40,340
Oh my god.

4196
03:31:40,480 --> 03:31:42,460
It is a very mobile nuclear missile system.

4197
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:44,440
A bipedal tank.

4198
03:31:45,400 --> 03:31:45,640
Ah!

4199
03:31:48,000 --> 03:31:48,560
R1.

4200
03:31:49,480 --> 03:31:50,800
A bipedal tank.

4201
03:31:51,100 --> 03:31:51,740
That's crazy.

4202
03:31:52,300 --> 03:31:52,600
Doki.

4203
03:31:52,920 --> 03:31:53,300
R1.

4204
03:31:55,880 --> 03:31:58,720
I thought that was the name of the take.

4205
03:31:59,140 --> 03:32:02,000
I was like, oh, the R1 take.

4206
03:32:02,100 --> 03:32:02,520
No.

4207
03:32:04,690 --> 03:32:07,040
That is Metal Gear Rex.

4208
03:32:08,100 --> 03:32:08,940
The Metal Gear?

4209
03:32:09,060 --> 03:32:10,480
Is that the Metal Gear reference?

4210
03:32:11,660 --> 03:32:12,980
Yeah, the reference, yeah.

4211
03:32:13,960 --> 03:32:15,780
It's like the one piece.

4212
03:32:18,140 --> 03:32:19,460
Metal Gear.

4213
03:32:20,940 --> 03:32:21,640
Solid.

4214
03:32:25,220 --> 03:32:26,520
No, he's solid.

4215
03:32:26,980 --> 03:32:28,260
Well, not him, but you know.

4216
03:32:29,340 --> 03:32:32,920
Well, you see, I'm going to send these documents to my
friend in the United States.

4217
03:32:33,040 --> 03:32:35,180
Oh, what?

4218
03:32:35,340 --> 03:32:35,340
What?

4219
03:32:35,680 --> 03:32:39,520
This is why this is why this is why I'm playing Metal Gear
Solid.

4220
03:32:39,680 --> 03:32:40,600
The first one is important.

4221
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:45,420
This is why you play the games in order, everybody.

4222
03:32:46,780 --> 03:32:46,800
Yes.

4223
03:32:47,920 --> 03:32:52,440
Sokolov's pathetic shagohan pales in comparison to my work.

4224
03:32:54,320 --> 03:33:08,280
going to do with a rocket engine on a tank about sokolov
tank does not need a rocket what does it need what nice

4225
03:33:08,280 --> 03:33:13,260
shoes yeah legs

4226
03:33:17,370 --> 03:33:25,260
snake is actually the dumbest guy he wants to put legs on a
tank.

4227
03:33:25,580 --> 03:33:26,600
Oh my okay.

4228
03:33:27,060 --> 03:33:27,060
What?

4229
03:33:29,460 --> 03:33:31,480
What if a tank can run?

4230
03:33:31,480 --> 03:33:33,080
That's why Metal Gear Rex is.

4231
03:33:33,220 --> 03:33:34,600
It's a tank with legs.

4232
03:33:35,260 --> 03:33:36,220
Oh my gosh.

4233
03:33:37,440 --> 03:33:39,300
What if a tank can run guys?

4234
03:33:40,900 --> 03:33:42,440
They should put legs on a...

4235
03:33:42,440 --> 03:33:44,240
They should put legs on a plane.

4236
03:33:45,160 --> 03:33:45,880
Oh yeah.

4237
03:33:46,160 --> 03:33:48,800
So when they dock, it's like a superhero pose.

4238
03:33:48,960 --> 03:33:50,460
Haven't you heard of the philosophers?

4239
03:33:51,720 --> 03:33:51,960
Okay.

4240
03:33:52,180 --> 03:33:52,900
Lord Dump here.

4241
03:33:52,980 --> 03:33:53,260
Okay.

4242
03:33:54,320 --> 03:34:05,140
their immense legacy Volgin's father was in charge of the
philosopher's money laundering activities in the confusion

4243
03:34:05,140 --> 03:34:17,140
of the war they somehow ended up with their treasure and
Volgin inherited that treasure illegally we never need to

4244
03:34:17,140 --> 03:34:23,280
worry about the military budget the development costs at our
facility are all paid yeah I was gonna say I don't fuck you

4245
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:32,560
to get the funds for this the weapons born here will be the
genes for creating an entirely new form you should add legs

4246
03:34:32,560 --> 03:34:45,860
on the helicopter in arms yeah the funding for my research
came out of that legacy came out of it now my money my men

4247
03:34:45,860 --> 03:34:50,180
all have been diverted to the shagohad project Shagohad.

4248
03:34:51,820 --> 03:34:53,100
Do you remember seeing that?

4249
03:34:53,300 --> 03:34:54,860
Sokolov is making the final preparations.

4250
03:34:54,880 --> 03:34:55,580
Which what part?

4251
03:34:55,740 --> 03:34:58,300
There's a lot of blueprints.

4252
03:34:58,300 --> 03:34:58,560
The Shagohad.

4253
03:35:00,640 --> 03:35:03,380
I'll explain after he's done with the lore.

4254
03:35:03,740 --> 03:35:05,740
Drinking myself into a stupor.

4255
03:35:06,340 --> 03:35:07,620
That's where they moved Sokolov.

4256
03:35:08,260 --> 03:35:08,680
Yes.

4257
03:35:09,020 --> 03:35:10,760
And the Shagohad is there too.

4258
03:35:11,460 --> 03:35:12,200
Of course.

4259
03:35:15,040 --> 03:35:15,660
Oh!

4260
03:35:16,220 --> 03:35:18,980

03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:26,400
20 helicopters we're carrying yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i

I wanted to thank you for complimenting me.

4266

That's so crazy.

4267
03:35:58,740 --> 03:36:02,900
I will betray my country because you complimented my shoes.

4268
03:36:04,700 --> 03:36:07,780
Well, he's already kind of like upset at everything.

4269
03:36:09,880 --> 03:36:13,620
You should be able to use it to sneak into the base.

4270
03:36:15,920 --> 03:36:16,920
Head to the mountains.

4271
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:29,800

yeah that's where i did the my my parkour Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4274
03:36:51,560 --> 03:36:53,360
Beyond that door lies the vast jungle.

4275
03:36:55,080 --> 03:36:57,760
You can climb up into the mountains from the far end of the
jungle.

4276
03:37:00,400 --> 03:37:01,360
Go back to the warehouse.

4277
03:37:01,420 --> 03:37:02,120
That door.

4278
03:37:02,540 --> 03:37:03,920
That exact door.

4279
03:37:06,440 --> 03:37:09,340
All the guys in here are gonna be so hungry.

4280
03:37:09,980 --> 03:37:14,900
Oh, yeah, they're gonna be so starving because I destroyed
all their food.

4281
03:37:15,420 --> 03:37:16,600
It's like real Russia.

4282
03:37:16,960 --> 03:37:17,520
Yeah, they haven't been able to snack or anything.

4283
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:31,660
He loves his country.

4284
03:37:33,780 --> 03:37:39,160
I cannot even imagine living anywhere else.

4285
03:37:39,800 --> 03:37:45,180
I wish to remain a hero of the great motherland.

4286
03:37:45,220 --> 03:37:49,400
I mean he's betraying his country though by helping an
American dog.

4287
03:37:55,190 --> 03:37:56,650
It is already dawn.

4288
03:37:57,770 --> 03:37:58,710
We must hurry.

4289
03:37:59,850 --> 03:38:00,070

Oh, look, there's the Gundam.

4293
03:38:07,170 --> 03:38:09,310
Why does he have a Gundam in his room?

4294
03:38:10,150 --> 03:38:11,330
It's from Zone of the Enders.

4295
03:38:11,530 --> 03:38:12,630
To capitalism.

4296
03:38:13,790 --> 03:38:14,790
To capitalism.

4297
03:38:15,630 --> 03:38:16,130
Capitalism?

4298
03:38:18,430 --> 03:38:20,830
Bro, he has the Medal of Lenin.

4299
03:38:22,330 --> 03:38:25,170
He just hates Sokolov because everyone was listening.

4300
03:38:25,190 --> 03:38:31,010
like no we're not gonna follow your plan we're gonna go with
sokolov's plan so he's really salty about it bro you guys

03:39:33,950 --> 03:39:35,950
Well, you cannot be a doctor anymore.

4317
03:39:37,750 --> 03:39:38,270
Yeah.

4318
03:39:38,630 --> 03:39:40,730
Ah, no fun.

4319
03:39:42,490 --> 03:39:42,970
Okay, wait.

4320
03:39:42,970 --> 03:39:43,290
I know.

4321
03:39:43,390 --> 03:39:44,170
No fun allowed.

4322
03:39:44,610 --> 03:39:46,210
No fun allowed.

4323
03:39:47,190 --> 03:39:49,470
Wait, I wanted to try...

4324
03:39:49,470 --> 03:39:50,290
What was the item?

4325
03:39:51,270 --> 03:39:53,090
The cigarette that you got.

4326
03:39:53,350 --> 03:39:53,770
Oh, there you go.

4327
03:39:53,830 --> 03:39:54,230
The cigarette.

4328
03:39:54,570 --> 03:39:55,010
Yeah.

4329
03:39:57,310 --> 03:39:58,470
What did I do with it?

4330
03:39:58,570 --> 03:40:00,810
You gotta be, like, really up on top of them, though.

4331
03:40:09,020 --> 03:40:10,180
Now, like, ready it.

4332
03:40:10,420 --> 03:40:10,560
Oh.

4333
03:40:16,800 --> 03:40:17,300
Did I...

4334
03:40:17,300 --> 03:40:18,040
Okay, he's...

4335
03:40:18,040 --> 03:40:18,140
Yeah.

4336
03:40:18,380 --> 03:40:20,120
You have a limited amount, also.

4337
03:40:20,660 --> 03:40:21,340
This is HQ.

4338
03:40:22,620 --> 03:40:23,020
Oh.

4339
03:40:23,860 --> 03:40:25,000
You can just leave.

4340
03:40:25,220 --> 03:40:25,600
Oh.

4341
03:40:27,340 --> 03:40:28,920
Oh, not leave that way.

4342
03:40:29,040 --> 03:40:30,380
Why did you go inside?

4343
03:40:31,280 --> 03:40:31,740
Um...

4344
03:40:34,360 --> 03:40:36,120
Not smoking kills, guys.

4345
03:40:37,820 --> 03:40:39,100
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4346
03:40:42,520 --> 03:40:43,580
Yeah, burn them.

4347
03:40:49,920 --> 03:40:50,940
They're not going to notice that.

4348
03:40:50,940 --> 03:40:51,180
Yeah.

4349
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:52,640
Now I leave.

4350
03:40:53,840 --> 03:40:53,940
Oh.

4351
03:40:54,380 --> 03:40:54,560
Oh.

4352
03:40:54,700 --> 03:40:55,160
Okay.

4353
03:40:55,760 --> 03:40:56,920
Now I leave.

4354
03:40:57,460 --> 03:40:59,720
Oh, my God.

4355
03:40:59,760 --> 03:41:01,300
Wait, this looks like Big Saru.

4356
03:41:04,300 --> 03:41:06,120
You're doing the real strat right now.

4357
03:41:06,980 --> 03:41:07,760
Okay, just keep going.

4358
03:41:08,120 --> 03:41:08,700
Just keep leaving.

4359
03:41:09,260 --> 03:41:09,740
There's people.

4360
03:41:09,940 --> 03:41:10,660
Go where you came from.

4361
03:41:11,080 --> 03:41:11,340
Yeah.

4362
03:41:12,420 --> 03:41:13,700
Are you going to use this?

4363
03:41:13,840 --> 03:41:14,840
I wouldn't use your suppressor.

4364
03:41:14,940 --> 03:41:15,240
Whoa!

4365
03:41:17,180 --> 03:41:17,980
Oh, no.

4366
03:41:19,340 --> 03:41:20,140
Wait, wait, what?

4367
03:41:20,760 --> 03:41:22,060
Can I stun the dog?

4368
03:41:22,940 --> 03:41:23,880
Yeah, you can stun anything.

4369
03:41:27,460 --> 03:41:28,560
Big Sado mentioned.

4370
03:41:29,360 --> 03:41:30,060
Why are you?

4371
03:41:30,060 --> 03:41:30,960
Don't waste it.

4372
03:41:31,060 --> 03:41:31,880
Wait, there's a lot of them.

4373
03:41:32,100 --> 03:41:32,820
Don't waste it.

4374
03:41:32,900 --> 03:41:34,940
Okay, okay, I didn't realize there's a lot of them.

4375
03:41:36,260 --> 03:41:37,060
Watch this.

4376
03:41:37,700 --> 03:41:38,440
Yeah, they're angry.

4377
03:41:39,900 --> 03:41:41,480
Okay, when you throw it, look away.

4378
03:41:41,600 --> 03:41:42,420
Okay, there you go.

4379
03:41:42,440 --> 03:41:43,400
It's like Counter-Strike.

4380
03:41:46,020 --> 03:41:46,460
Did it work?

4381
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:47,300
Did it work?

4382
03:41:47,420 --> 03:41:48,480
Did it work?

4383
03:41:48,580 --> 03:41:49,420
What did I do?

4384
03:41:49,680 --> 03:41:50,500
I don't know.

4385
03:41:51,160 --> 03:41:52,700
I don't know what happened.

4386
03:41:54,940 --> 03:41:56,360
Oh, not disinfected yet.

4387
03:42:01,240 --> 03:42:02,240
Look away.

4388
03:42:02,520 --> 03:42:03,180
Oh, there you go.

4389
03:42:03,420 --> 03:42:03,580
Yeah.

4390
03:42:03,820 --> 03:42:04,620
Oh, there you go, yeah.

4391
03:42:08,520 --> 03:42:09,020
Oh.

4392
03:42:11,900 --> 03:42:12,900
All right.

4393
03:42:13,300 --> 03:42:13,660
Oh.

4394
03:42:14,280 --> 03:42:14,580
Oh.

4395
03:42:15,240 --> 03:42:15,980
Oh, so close.

4396
03:42:15,980 --> 03:42:16,440
I'll just kill this guy.

4397
03:42:16,620 --> 03:42:17,460
Yeah, I'll just kill that guy.

4398
03:42:17,520 --> 03:42:18,380
Yeah, just kill that guy.

4399
03:42:18,580 --> 03:42:19,740
Okay, now I'll kill him too.

4400
03:42:20,420 --> 03:42:21,380
Yeah, kill him too.

4401
03:42:22,040 --> 03:42:22,600
There we go.

4402
03:42:22,860 --> 03:42:23,040
Yeah.

4403
03:42:26,000 --> 03:42:26,460
The dog,

4404
03:42:39,540 --> 03:42:40,040
the dog.

4405
03:42:40,160 --> 03:42:40,520
It's okay.

4406
03:42:40,720 --> 03:42:41,240
It's okay.

4407
03:42:41,380 --> 03:42:42,060
The dog's fine.

4408
03:42:43,400 --> 03:42:44,860
Dog's fine, guys.

4409
03:42:45,100 --> 03:42:45,600
Don't worry.

4410
03:42:45,920 --> 03:42:46,640
Oh, shit.

4411
03:42:48,760 --> 03:42:50,740
Oh, where did that guy come from?

4412
03:42:51,240 --> 03:42:51,640
Oh.

4413
03:42:53,800 --> 03:42:54,580
Oh, my God.

4414
03:42:54,820 --> 03:42:55,120
Fuck this.

4415
03:42:55,300 --> 03:42:56,680
Oh, there's multiple guys coming out.

4416
03:42:56,800 --> 03:42:57,000
Oh, my God.

4417
03:42:57,120 --> 03:42:57,860
Oh, my God.

4418
03:42:58,060 --> 03:42:58,380
It's okay.

4419
03:42:58,580 --> 03:42:59,480
Oh, my God.

4420
03:42:59,800 --> 03:43:00,340
Oh, my God.

4421
03:43:00,340 --> 03:43:01,120
Oh, my God.

4422
03:43:01,240 --> 03:43:01,500
It's okay.

4423
03:43:01,620 --> 03:43:02,000
It's okay.

4424
03:43:05,540 --> 03:43:06,280
Oh, oh.

4425
03:43:07,340 --> 03:43:09,380
You can maybe use a...

4426
03:43:09,380 --> 03:43:10,080
Okay, yeah.

4427
03:43:10,140 --> 03:43:10,760
You use a what?

4428
03:43:10,960 --> 03:43:11,200
It's fine.

4429
03:43:11,440 --> 03:43:11,820
Use a what?

4430
03:43:11,880 --> 03:43:12,140
Nothing.

4431
03:43:13,520 --> 03:43:14,340
No, nothing.

4432
03:43:14,460 --> 03:43:14,980
Use a what?

4433
03:43:16,680 --> 03:43:17,600
No, no, use a what?

4434
03:43:17,940 --> 03:43:18,640
Mouse active.

4435
03:43:18,720 --> 03:43:21,580
I was gonna say like your AK, but so you don't waste these
bullets.

4436
03:43:22,040 --> 03:43:23,280
Yeah, but I got two hit shots.

4437
03:43:24,200 --> 03:43:24,340
Oh.

4438
03:43:33,370 --> 03:43:35,450
I'm so glad he didn't overreact.

4439
03:43:41,330 --> 03:43:42,930
I knew he was gonna wing.

4440
03:43:43,150 --> 03:43:43,850
I have to be sure.

4441
03:43:44,250 --> 03:43:45,150
I'm not.

4442
03:43:49,810 --> 03:43:54,370
Wait, I tell you, you can trick the dog.

4443
03:43:54,910 --> 03:43:56,590
You can trick the dog with a cigarette.

4444
03:43:57,130 --> 03:43:57,530
Yeah, yeah.

4445
03:43:58,490 --> 03:44:01,090
We have to test the theory out.

4446
03:44:04,650 --> 03:44:06,510
The theory was right.

4447
03:44:07,390 --> 03:44:08,030
Oh, you're hungry.

4448
03:44:08,330 --> 03:44:09,870
Oh, I am so hungry.

4449
03:44:10,870 --> 03:44:11,170
Hungry.

03:47:42,860 --> 03:47:44,780
Okay, this sniper barely does damage.

4503
03:47:44,800 --> 03:47:46,200
I'm not gonna lie.

4504
03:47:48,500 --> 03:47:50,580
Like, I might as...

4505
03:47:50,580 --> 03:47:52,820
You're already at, like, a quarter of the way, almost.

4506
03:47:55,180 --> 03:47:55,980
There we go.

4507
03:47:58,220 --> 03:47:59,920
Like, you're just standing at one spot.

4508
03:48:00,240 --> 03:48:02,000
Hey, he's got to come over!

4509
03:48:02,760 --> 03:48:03,800
Oh, here it comes.

4510
03:48:05,440 --> 03:48:06,520
Oh, what?

4511
03:48:07,260 --> 03:48:08,400
He said here it comes!

4512
03:48:08,760 --> 03:48:09,480
Oh, my God.

4513
03:48:09,560 --> 03:48:13,040
I couldn't see the fucking jungle is sending me music right
now.

4514
03:48:13,860 --> 03:48:14,400
Like...

4515
03:48:15,400 --> 03:48:16,200
You're burned.

4516
03:48:16,760 --> 03:48:17,600
Oh, my God.

4517
03:48:19,100 --> 03:48:20,760
All right, we'll see what the AK does.

4518
03:48:21,020 --> 03:48:22,740
I feel like...

4519
03:48:22,740 --> 03:48:23,160
Yeah.

4520
03:48:24,220 --> 03:48:24,940
Oh, there he is.

4521
03:48:25,120 --> 03:48:25,720
We're fine now.

4522
03:48:25,840 --> 03:48:26,900
Yeah, no, the AK does more.

4523
03:48:27,320 --> 03:48:27,820
Oh, yeah.

4524
03:48:27,940 --> 03:48:28,960

03:48:34,020 --> 03:48:34,900
What is he sending?

4528
03:48:35,200 --> 03:48:36,000
Oh, you might want to move.

4529
03:48:36,200 --> 03:48:37,120
Yeah, I was going to say, do I?

4530
03:48:37,340 --> 03:48:38,940
Yeah, I don't trust that area.

4531
03:48:39,200 --> 03:48:39,500
Yeah.

4532
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:42,720
Where is fear?

4533
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:44,780
He does run on the ground sometimes.

4534
03:48:44,800 --> 03:48:58,780
times too so watch out for traps watch out for traps oh wow

03:49:16,440 --> 03:49:18,460
I keep wanting to suture it.

4539
03:49:18,900 --> 03:49:19,700
And then I got a knife.

4540
03:49:19,880 --> 03:49:19,960

Yeah.

4543
03:49:30,250 --> 03:49:32,310
Oh my god, it's so fast.

4544
03:49:35,670 --> 03:49:37,670
So if you do it like non-lethal.

4545
03:49:50,280 --> 03:49:51,660
What the fuck?

4546
03:49:54,260 --> 03:49:56,980
Oh my god, he has like combustion.

4547
03:49:58,100 --> 03:50:08,860
They all do it's just normal cobra unit things just But if
you do it if you do it least or non-lethal Yeah, um He'll

4548
03:50:08,860 --> 03:50:14,960
like, you know because it's his stamina he can replenish it
so he'll like go down on the ground and like eat animals and

4549
03:50:14,960 --> 03:50:18,520
stuff It's like so and then what do you mean by non-lethal
though?

4550
03:50:19,180 --> 03:50:27,080
Like do I so you have you has like a stamina bar just like
you do yeah so you can do it non-lethaly with draining their

4551
03:50:27,080 --> 03:50:38,460
stamina instead of oh and then he just gets tired and then
but they still explode and die like yeah you use the trank

4552
03:50:38,460 --> 03:50:48,740
gun oh oh okay and oh no no that trank gun is not it that I
know, that's why it's so easy If you do it lethal It's not

4553
03:50:48,740 --> 03:50:58,520
in, no, that No, I fuck, no, I do not fuck With a train gun

You think they're still there?

4564
03:51:34,420 --> 03:51:35,500

Look at that.

4587

4594
03:53:19,530 --> 03:53:19,930
Yes.

4595
03:53:20,410 --> 03:53:23,750
I bet the water in here is like, probably has like gas and
stuff in it.

4596
03:53:23,870 --> 03:53:24,570
It's probably disgusting.

4597
03:53:26,250 --> 03:53:26,650
Yes.

4598
03:53:27,690 --> 03:53:27,910
Yes.

4599
03:53:28,710 --> 03:53:29,590
Get that out of the gate.

4600
03:53:30,350 --> 03:53:31,370
Oh, I think he's already dead.

4601
03:53:31,570 --> 03:53:31,990
Get him.

4602
03:53:33,650 --> 03:53:34,450
No, this guy.

4603
03:53:34,570 --> 03:53:36,230
Oh, no, he's still alive.

4604
03:53:36,490 --> 03:53:36,610
Never mind.

4605
03:53:36,750 --> 03:53:38,970
No, we're just got to line up.

4606
03:53:39,230 --> 03:53:40,830
Line it up correctly.

4607
03:53:41,850 --> 03:53:42,610
Yes.

4608
03:53:43,510 --> 03:53:45,450
This is so...

4609
03:53:45,450 --> 03:53:47,550
This is so messed up.

4610
03:53:48,970 --> 03:53:50,230
Non-lethal, she said.

4611
03:53:50,550 --> 03:53:51,530
Non-lethal, she said.

4612
03:53:54,050 --> 03:53:56,030
I did it, guys.

4613
03:53:57,070 --> 03:53:59,730
It's as non-lethal as I could do.

4614
03:54:02,890 --> 03:54:04,730
I did it.

4615
03:54:05,990 --> 03:54:06,510
Yeah!

4616
03:54:06,950 --> 03:54:07,330
Yeah!

4617
03:54:11,190 --> 03:54:20,210
just want to watch the world bring telling you about the
torch was a good idea yeah I think there's like a thing over

4618
03:54:20,210 --> 03:54:30,730
here in the corner yeah a camel there it is oh oh there my
goggles whoa I can see in the dark now I think there's

4619
03:54:30,730 --> 03:54:40,570
people that right next to you the rat no there's a box oh
it's bandages oh see you need that okay now I got the book I

4620
03:54:40,570 --> 03:54:51,330
don't think there's a guy up there would you like to read
okay there's no guy up there then it's cqc oh we already

4621
03:54:51,330 --> 03:55:01,910
made it nice yeah so um you can leave obviously yeah but uh
just you can like actually leave you're not gonna go into it

4622
03:55:01,910 --> 03:55:09,110
like anything or okay but you're um there's a little bit of
time before you head into the fight with the end yeah which

4623
03:55:09,110 --> 03:55:17,050
i would recommend um doing next time because his fight is
kind of I actually I don't know you might be able to do it

4624
03:55:17,050 --> 03:55:26,050
but it's basically his fight is kind of RNG so oh yeah it
could take you two seconds or it could take you two hours

4625
03:55:26,050 --> 03:55:41,690
why why would his fight take two hours why not yet anyway
but you better It's faster lethal.

4626
03:55:42,130 --> 03:55:47,790
That's why I'm saying it might be okay, but it's just the
RNG aspect of it.

4627
03:55:48,790 --> 03:55:53,710
The Colonel won't have any qualms about killing him if he
thinks the CIA is closing in.

4628
03:55:54,130 --> 03:55:56,610
Eva, you can't let Sokolov out of your sight.

4629
03:55:57,290 --> 03:55:58,730
Sokolov's gonna die!

4630
03:55:59,450 --> 03:56:00,150
Oh no!

4631
03:56:01,350 --> 03:56:02,170
Grozny Grad.

4632
03:56:02,350 --> 03:56:05,930
That I should be able to get there from the mountains to the
north through an underground tunnel.

4633
03:56:06,570 --> 03:56:07,350
Granin told you?

4634
03:56:07,910 --> 03:56:10,390
Yeah, he even gave me the key to the warehouse.

4635
03:56:10,850 --> 03:56:11,250
Why?

4636
03:56:12,090 --> 03:56:13,290
Because he was drunk, I guess.

4637
03:56:14,010 --> 03:56:15,230
You've got to be kidding me.

4638
03:56:16,070 --> 03:56:16,470
No.

4639
03:56:17,370 --> 03:56:19,510
Snake, there's one problem with that route.

4640
03:56:19,970 --> 03:56:20,610
What problem?

4641
03:56:21,230 --> 03:56:24,950
The mountain entrance to the underground tunnel that leads
to the fortress is sealed.

4642
03:56:25,390 --> 03:56:26,670
You need a key to get in.

4643
03:56:27,110 --> 03:56:27,570
A key?

4644
03:56:27,650 --> 03:56:28,130
A key?

4645
03:56:28,410 --> 03:56:29,270
What about the key grant?

4646
03:56:29,270 --> 03:56:29,550
Yeah.

4647
03:56:29,750 --> 03:56:30,530
Didn't you give me a key?

4648
03:56:30,670 --> 03:56:30,970

03:56:34,450 --> 03:56:36,570
Like, what the fuck does a key do then?

4652
03:56:36,690 --> 03:56:37,690
It opens the tunnel.

4653
03:56:37,970 --> 03:56:38,030
It opens the tunnel.

4654
03:56:38,030 --> 03:56:38,950
On top of the mountains.

4655
03:56:39,410 --> 03:56:39,970

Alright.

4671
03:57:35,470 --> 03:57:36,190
Probably the sniper.

4672
03:57:36,790 --> 03:57:37,210
Probably the sniper.

4673
03:57:37,530 --> 03:57:40,770
But I would save before, like I would save in this right
thing right now.

4674
03:57:40,790 --> 03:57:40,970
No.

4675
03:57:41,290 --> 03:57:41,610
All right.

4676
03:57:43,290 --> 03:57:43,690
All right.

4677
03:57:44,050 --> 03:57:44,890
Ring, ring, ring.

4678
03:57:45,590 --> 03:57:46,730
Saving the game, Snake.

4679
03:57:47,090 --> 03:57:47,310
Yeah.

4680
03:57:51,800 --> 03:57:54,400
Snake, have you heard of It Came from Outer Space?

4681
03:57:54,580 --> 03:57:55,260
Oh, another space?

4682
03:57:55,420 --> 03:57:55,740
Wait, didn't?

4683
03:57:55,840 --> 03:57:56,000
Yeah.

4684
03:57:56,140 --> 03:57:57,240
She told me this movie.

4685
03:57:57,320 --> 03:57:57,640
Yeah.

4686
03:58:00,220 --> 03:58:02,900
Like the next four calls is just about this one movie.

4687
03:58:03,520 --> 03:58:05,240
She was really into it, okay?

4688
03:58:05,260 --> 03:58:06,960
He's really into the space movie.

4689
03:58:07,000 --> 03:58:08,580
The safety effects were quite realistic.

4690
03:58:09,260 --> 03:58:11,980
I've got all the real I can handle here in the jungle.

4691
03:58:12,700 --> 03:58:13,020
No.

4692
03:58:13,500 --> 03:58:14,820
Wait, was there even 3D?

4693
03:58:15,640 --> 03:58:16,080
Like...

4694
03:58:16,080 --> 03:58:16,520
Like...

4695
03:58:16,520 --> 03:58:18,560
With the images jumping out of the screen at you.

4696
03:58:18,980 --> 03:58:20,660
It makes for a nice escape from reality.

4697
03:58:21,540 --> 03:58:22,680
I have to admit it made my...

4698
03:58:22,680 --> 03:58:23,440
Wait, didn't this...

4699
03:58:23,440 --> 03:58:24,700
When was 3D invented?

4700
03:58:24,760 --> 03:58:26,240
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's...

4701
03:58:26,240 --> 03:58:29,860
Wouldn't that this movie be after the Cold War?

4702
03:58:30,360 --> 03:58:33,540
I was still in college, so probably about 10 years ago?

4703
03:58:34,140 --> 03:58:35,400
Guess I'm out of luck then.

4704
03:58:35,760 --> 03:58:36,840
Red and blue 3D?

4705
03:58:36,980 --> 03:58:38,380
You know, they're coming out with household versions of...

4706
03:58:38,380 --> 03:58:40,000
Oh, 1940s?

4707
03:58:40,200 --> 03:58:40,500
Oh!

4708
03:58:40,780 --> 03:58:41,140
Whoa!

4709
03:58:42,820 --> 03:58:43,480
I didn't know.

4710
03:58:43,500 --> 03:58:44,760
not know that.

4711
03:58:45,600 --> 03:58:45,900
Whoa.

4712
03:58:47,580 --> 03:58:51,060
I was gonna say, they exist around the Cold War?

4713
03:58:52,800 --> 03:58:53,540
You're kidding.

4714
03:58:54,700 --> 03:58:55,780
You're kidding.

4715
03:58:56,020 --> 03:58:58,620
Someday they might make movies where you control the
characters yourself.

4716
03:59:02,420 --> 03:59:04,700
Oh man, I wonder when that'll happen.

4717
03:59:05,200 --> 03:59:06,180
Yeah, I wonder when that'll happen.

4718
03:59:07,000 --> 03:59:08,540
Probably call my dad real quick.

4719
03:59:09,580 --> 03:59:11,560
He's gonna tell you to fight the end.

4720
03:59:12,460 --> 03:59:13,080
Hey dad.

4721
03:59:13,500 --> 03:59:14,560
Are you proud of me?

4722
03:59:15,820 --> 03:59:19,540
Yeah, she said we'd meet up in the ruins at the top of the
mountains.

4723
03:59:20,360 --> 03:59:24,340
She also said she picked up the key to get into the tunnel
that leads to Groznygrad.

4724
03:59:25,000 --> 03:59:25,020
Good.

4725
03:59:25,440 --> 03:59:26,720
Hurry to the rendezvous with Eva.

4726
03:59:26,960 --> 03:59:27,820
Head for the mountains.

4727
03:59:28,360 --> 03:59:29,320
Proceed north through the woods.

4728
03:59:29,720 --> 03:59:31,100
There's an entrance to a mine shaft.

4729
03:59:31,200 --> 03:59:32,840
Oh, you just scared me.

4730
03:59:33,300 --> 03:59:34,980
But dad, aren't you proud of me?

4731
03:59:35,260 --> 03:59:35,860
I'm on it.

4732
03:59:37,180 --> 03:59:39,080
Do you not see what I did?

4733
03:59:40,300 --> 03:59:42,340
Yeah, time for the end.

4734
03:59:42,560 --> 03:59:43,220
There's no way.

4735
03:59:43,500 --> 03:59:51,100
that's crazy it's like back-to-back boss but i know this
part is kind of funny with it i was like did i was like i

4736
03:59:51,100 --> 03:59:58,300
literally just killed a boss you're gonna go through like
all like the last three basically and then you hit like a

4737
03:59:58,300 --> 04:00:05,600
point where you don't go through fights boss fights for a
while and then you do the final ones oh yeah it's gonna say

4738
04:00:05,600 --> 04:00:14,420
i thought they would like pace it because like you know no
there's like no she only has three I already killed all

4739
04:00:14,420 --> 04:00:14,740
three.

4740
04:00:14,860 --> 04:00:17,340
But yeah, I still have a lot of playtime left.

4741
04:00:17,860 --> 04:00:21,500
So I was like, I'm pretty confused about that.

4742
04:00:25,190 --> 04:00:26,770
Oh, I hear the bees.

4743
04:00:27,590 --> 04:00:28,070
The bees.

4744
04:00:33,430 --> 04:00:34,390
I'm lost.

4745
04:00:35,410 --> 04:00:36,110
You have a map.

4746
04:00:37,190 --> 04:00:37,950
Oh, is this it?

4747
04:00:39,070 --> 04:00:39,450
Yeah.

4748
04:00:39,610 --> 04:00:40,710
Oh, wait, there's people here?

4749
04:00:40,830 --> 04:00:41,510
Oh, my God.

4750
04:00:41,990 --> 04:00:43,810
Yeah, why would you think there weren't be?

4751
04:00:44,210 --> 04:00:46,370
I thought you said I'd go see the end.

4752
04:00:47,130 --> 04:00:48,230
Yeah, you will.

4753
04:00:51,650 --> 04:01:05,050
I just assume I'll see him here you gotta get up there oh my
god are you what the fuck where did he come from holy cow

04:01:05,050 --> 04:01:14,090

4755
04:01:14,090 --> 04:01:19,750
you should reload while you're running Like, it's already
too late for me.

4756
04:01:19,850 --> 04:01:21,030
They already called everyone in.

4757
04:01:23,610 --> 04:01:25,110
Stealth is off, you know what, everybody?

4758
04:01:27,150 --> 04:01:28,450
Is this the right way?

4759
04:01:28,630 --> 04:01:29,170
Yeah, it is.

4760
04:01:29,270 --> 04:01:30,090
It is, it is.

4761
04:01:32,510 --> 04:01:33,770
There's no stealth anymore.

4762
04:01:33,870 --> 04:01:36,050
They already called the reinforcements.

4763
04:01:37,630 --> 04:01:38,530
They're over here.

4764
04:01:39,690 --> 04:01:40,370
Oh, CQC.

4765
04:01:40,650 --> 04:01:41,290
CQC him.

4766
04:01:41,950 --> 04:01:42,270
Yeah!

4767
04:01:43,530 --> 04:01:43,930
Alright.

4768
04:01:44,830 --> 04:01:46,690
Well, he's alive, but whatever.

4769
04:01:47,610 --> 04:01:48,430
Wait, where's his buddy?

4770
04:01:48,450 --> 04:01:49,190
There's his buddy.

4771
04:01:50,430 --> 04:01:50,950
Wait, what?

4772
04:01:51,430 --> 04:01:51,690
There you go.

4773
04:01:51,690 --> 04:01:52,710
I told you he was alive.

4774
04:01:55,330 --> 04:01:55,990
There we go.

4775
04:01:57,110 --> 04:01:57,630
There we go.

4776
04:01:57,670 --> 04:02:01,070
CQC is not to kill unless you slit their throat.

4777
04:02:01,110 --> 04:02:03,630
Yeah, but he like, he, like, I thought he was still
sleeping.

4778
04:02:04,710 --> 04:02:06,890
Oh my God, how many people are in this area?

4779
04:02:07,390 --> 04:02:09,050
There's a lot of guys in this area.

4780
04:02:09,930 --> 04:02:10,130
Oh.

4781
04:02:11,070 --> 04:02:11,770
Oh my God.

4782
04:02:11,890 --> 04:02:13,010
And then he brings his pistol.

4783
04:02:13,130 --> 04:02:13,590
Game doko.

4784
04:02:14,030 --> 04:02:15,910
I thought you were playing with a mouse.

4785
04:02:16,190 --> 04:02:17,090
Okay, all right.

4786
04:02:17,310 --> 04:02:18,250
Oh my God.

4787
04:02:18,450 --> 04:02:20,390
Okay, I'm flipping back on the mouse.

4788
04:02:20,730 --> 04:02:22,150
I wanted to do seek.

4789
04:02:22,370 --> 04:02:23,210
I wanted to wait.

4790
04:02:23,870 --> 04:02:24,870
Let me cure myself.

4791
04:02:25,550 --> 04:02:27,050
I wanted to, oh no.

4792
04:02:27,230 --> 04:02:28,790
Oh no, it's in my head.

4793
04:02:29,830 --> 04:02:30,790
Brain damage.

4794
04:02:31,470 --> 04:02:32,150
Brain damage.

4795
04:02:33,150 --> 04:02:33,630
Disinfected.

4796
04:02:34,190 --> 04:02:34,650
Bandage.

4797
04:02:35,670 --> 04:02:35,970
Bleeding.

4798
04:02:37,230 --> 04:02:37,990
All right, here we go.

4799
04:02:39,050 --> 04:02:41,230
And then I need to eat real quick.

4800
04:02:42,550 --> 04:02:43,050
I need to eat.

4801
04:02:43,190 --> 04:02:44,010
I got pranked.

4802
04:02:44,110 --> 04:02:44,870
That's so great.

4803
04:02:45,030 --> 04:02:45,930
Get pranked, bro.

4804
04:02:47,470 --> 04:02:48,430
All right.

4805
04:02:48,450 --> 04:02:51,330
Alright, now, now I can do my stealth thing.

4806
04:02:52,190 --> 04:02:52,590
You're what?

4807
04:02:52,850 --> 04:02:54,010
Now I can start stealthing.

4808
04:02:54,230 --> 04:02:57,090
Because I didn't realize there were a lot of people on this
hill.

4809
04:02:58,030 --> 04:02:59,310
Yeah, there's a lot of guys.

4810
04:02:59,570 --> 04:03:00,490
Alright, watch this.

4811
04:03:05,170 --> 04:03:07,450
Okay, now that he's dead.

4812
04:03:08,230 --> 04:03:09,630
Oh, I'm behind him.

4813
04:03:09,710 --> 04:03:10,550
Oh, my God.

4814
04:03:10,930 --> 04:03:11,850
Okay, give me a sec.

4815
04:03:11,950 --> 04:03:12,310
Let me look at the map.

4816
04:03:12,310 --> 04:03:13,470
You should just keep going, I think.

4817
04:03:13,490 --> 04:03:14,470
Yeah, I'm already here.

4818
04:03:15,030 --> 04:03:16,470
Yeah, let it just go.

4819
04:03:18,450 --> 04:03:20,890
There we go, get me out of here.

4820
04:03:20,890 --> 04:03:27,210
Oh man, good times.

4821
04:03:27,730 --> 04:03:27,730
Yay!

4822
04:03:31,790 --> 04:03:34,490
So when does the stealth start?

4823
04:03:34,930 --> 04:03:35,810
Right now!

4824
04:03:36,010 --> 04:03:37,910
No, no, no, no, no, no, this is a boss fight.

4825
04:03:38,070 --> 04:03:39,930
We're not, we're not doing it for the boss fight.

4826
04:03:40,350 --> 04:03:41,650
Oh, uh, yeah, you can.

4827
04:03:44,210 --> 04:03:45,730
I love this speech.

4828
04:03:45,870 --> 04:03:46,470
It's so good.

4829
04:03:47,190 --> 04:03:48,270
Oh, there he is.

4830
04:03:49,910 --> 04:03:51,470
Oh, he's in full camo.

4831
04:03:51,950 --> 04:03:53,790
Wait, who put that outfit on him?

4832
04:03:53,790 --> 04:03:55,150
Because he was not wearing that.

4833
04:03:55,730 --> 04:03:56,370
Yes, he was.

4834
04:03:56,530 --> 04:03:57,010
Was he?

4835
04:03:57,630 --> 04:03:57,710
Oh.

4836
04:03:57,710 --> 04:03:58,110
Yeah.

4837
04:03:59,250 --> 04:04:00,290
You can't shoot him.

4838
04:04:00,350 --> 04:04:01,170
He's got a bird.

4839
04:04:03,430 --> 04:04:04,230
Oh, shit.

4840
04:04:04,370 --> 04:04:05,090
He woke up.

4841
04:04:05,870 --> 04:04:06,650
When is the end?

4842
04:04:07,230 --> 04:04:07,530
Yeah.

4843
04:04:08,310 --> 04:04:09,550
Time to fight, baby.

4844
04:04:09,970 --> 04:04:10,870
Oh, God.

4845
04:04:11,050 --> 04:04:12,130
I hate that.

4846
04:04:14,890 --> 04:04:15,590
That shit.

4847
04:04:15,610 --> 04:04:16,730
I beg of you.

4848
04:04:18,450 --> 04:04:22,370
me the strength to take this final prey

4849
04:04:26,330 --> 04:04:35,250
let me linger in this world just a little longer so i
thought i would kill the end in the end not in the beginning

4850
04:04:35,250 --> 04:04:51,780
no why would you think that because his name is the end Oh
my god, he's God's chosen one.

4851
04:04:52,400 --> 04:04:54,360
Yeah, he's the power of God in anime.

4852
04:04:58,300 --> 04:04:59,540
God's favorite.

4853
04:05:01,940 --> 04:05:08,760
My sleep would have been eternal.

4854
04:05:09,100 --> 04:05:09,920
Oh.

4855
04:05:15,040 --> 04:05:15,500
Oh!

4856
04:05:16,540 --> 04:05:20,140
Do you hear me, Snake?

4857
04:05:21,100 --> 04:05:21,660
There's me.

4858
04:05:22,020 --> 04:05:24,100
I am the end.

4859
04:05:24,660 --> 04:05:25,780
He's so cool.

4860
04:05:25,860 --> 04:05:29,680
I am here to send you to your ultimate fate.

4861
04:05:30,840 --> 04:05:31,540
You can R1 again.

4862
04:05:32,460 --> 04:05:32,900
Oh, oh.

4863
04:05:37,200 --> 04:05:39,220
Oh, God, stop.

4864
04:05:40,440 --> 04:05:41,720
Not that.

4865
04:05:42,160 --> 04:05:43,280
He's a guard sniper.

4866
04:05:58,690 --> 04:06:06,370
I found that sniper you were talking about that's the end
he's a legend known as the father of sniping I've got

4867
04:06:06,370 --> 04:06:15,710
experience yeah urban and marine environments what about the
forest never I see well that forest is divided into three

4868
04:06:15,710 --> 04:06:29,090
areas a river um man is this the river is that sounds like
is that the river no is that is that just forget about that

4869
04:06:29,090 --> 04:06:31,070
is that the river that

4870
04:06:35,670 --> 04:06:40,690
this guy's over a hundred years old though so i should have
the advantage in terms of stamina

4871
04:06:43,950 --> 04:06:54,490
i've heard that his body is photo oh it's like quiet oh my
god is that like his dad is our dad to the forest too so in

4872
04:06:54,490 --> 04:07:01,170

4881
04:08:30,700 --> 04:08:43,560
all right so i don't see him in any of those spots then you

Okay, okay, I...

4891
04:09:51,540 --> 04:09:53,160
Okay, okay, okay.

4892

You might want to up your camo, like, for real.

Okay, yeah, no, I agree now.

4894

04:10:02,720 --> 04:10:04,300
You might be right.

4896
04:10:04,420 --> 04:10:06,000
You might be right.

4897
04:10:13,140 --> 04:10:13,980
Okay, uh...

4898
04:10:13,980 --> 04:10:16,000
Which one is...

04:10:17,580 --> 04:10:19,100
Okay, I think this one.

4900
04:10:19,280 --> 04:10:22,040
Naked Woodland apparently is the best.

4901
04:10:23,040 --> 04:10:23,460
Woodland.

4902
04:10:25,440 --> 04:10:27,860
Wait, how come I can't... Oh, I already using it, right?

4903
04:10:28,320 --> 04:10:29,240
Wait, why can't I use it?

4904
04:10:29,240 --> 04:10:30,640
Yeah, I think it's already on your face.

4905
04:10:30,840 --> 04:10:32,060
This is a no paint though.

4906
04:10:33,600 --> 04:10:34,960
Yeah, but you have stuff on your face.

4907
04:10:35,100 --> 04:10:35,880
Oh, okay.

4919
04:11:57,390 --> 04:11:57,650
Okay.

4920
04:12:00,090 --> 04:12:00,950
He moved.

4921
04:12:01,250 --> 04:12:03,830
Yeah, he definitely moved because he's not shooting at you
anymore.

4922
04:12:04,190 --> 04:12:04,830
That's my bad.

4923
04:12:04,950 --> 04:12:06,210
I did not mean to shoot that gun.

4924
04:12:09,190 --> 04:12:09,970
He's behind.

4925
04:12:10,090 --> 04:12:10,590
I see him.

4926
04:12:10,590 --> 04:12:11,050
I see him.

4927
04:12:11,610 --> 04:12:12,270
Yeah, you see his glint.

4928
04:12:12,430 --> 04:12:12,730
You see it?

4929
04:12:12,730 --> 04:12:13,070
Yeah, yeah.

4930
04:12:13,490 --> 04:12:14,010
The shine.

4931
04:12:15,010 --> 04:12:15,790
Oh, nice, nice.

4932
04:12:18,910 --> 04:12:19,790
Where are you old man?

4933
04:12:20,730 --> 04:12:22,070
He's like right behind that tree.

4934
04:12:22,790 --> 04:12:23,470
There we go.

4935
04:12:24,590 --> 04:12:25,150
There we go.

4936
04:12:25,330 --> 04:12:27,430
Oh, okay.

4937
04:12:27,710 --> 04:12:28,310
So, okay.

4938
04:12:28,610 --> 04:12:29,630
Yeah, he actually runs.

4939
04:12:29,770 --> 04:12:30,650
Okay, okay.

4940
04:12:30,930 --> 04:12:33,110
He's very limber for an old man.

4941
04:12:34,930 --> 04:12:36,070
He's so fast.

4942
04:12:36,730 --> 04:12:37,270
He's just fucking running.

4943
04:12:38,110 --> 04:12:39,350
Yeah, he books it.

4944
04:12:42,530 --> 04:12:43,450
Nice, nice.

4945
04:12:44,610 --> 04:12:47,370
I don't see him right now, so he ran this way.

4946
04:12:47,590 --> 04:12:47,590
Yeah, he took off.

4947
04:12:47,630 --> 04:12:48,270
He took off.

4948
04:12:48,390 --> 04:12:49,050
Yeah, that way.

4949
04:12:49,790 --> 04:12:50,730
Yeah, through there.

4950
04:12:52,950 --> 04:12:55,910
Yeah, he's very fucking nimble for an Yeah.

4951
04:12:58,290 --> 04:12:59,230
He goes.

4952
04:12:59,670 --> 04:13:00,550
Where the fuck did he go?

4953
04:13:01,290 --> 04:13:02,810
I told him he's fast.

4954
04:13:03,610 --> 04:13:05,390
Like that's way too fast.

4955
04:13:05,790 --> 04:13:07,530
No, he's really fast.

4956
04:13:08,370 --> 04:13:13,730
I'm gonna give you lots of ammo too.

4957
04:13:14,550 --> 04:13:15,370
Oh, oh, oh.

4958
04:13:16,290 --> 04:13:19,070
I think he's up top, like up in the middle.

4959
04:13:19,350 --> 04:13:19,870
Yeah, I see him.

4960
04:13:21,630 --> 04:13:22,790
Actually, I don't see him.

4961
04:13:24,270 --> 04:13:27,210
It looked like his bullet came from the right.

4962
04:13:27,370 --> 04:13:28,650
Oh, I see him.

4963
04:13:28,810 --> 04:13:29,070
You do?

4964
04:13:30,250 --> 04:13:30,990
Wait, yep.

4965
04:13:32,810 --> 04:13:33,490
There we go.

4966
04:13:38,030 --> 04:13:40,250
Like, there's no way he got that far.

4967
04:13:40,730 --> 04:13:42,830
Because he's not going into other areas right now.

4968
04:13:43,590 --> 04:13:44,170
You're getting lucky.

4969
04:13:45,770 --> 04:13:46,770
Where do you go?

4970
04:13:47,530 --> 04:13:48,170
He ran.

4971
04:13:48,930 --> 04:13:50,810
How did he even get up there?

4972
04:13:51,370 --> 04:13:54,370
How the fuck did he even get up there?

4973
04:13:54,810 --> 04:13:56,150
There's no way.

4974
04:13:56,270 --> 04:13:56,950
There's no way.

4975
04:13:57,370 --> 04:13:59,270
He had insta-transmission some shit.

4976
04:14:04,290 --> 04:14:05,250
Oh my...

4977
04:14:05,410 --> 04:14:05,550
Oh.

4978
04:14:07,350 --> 04:14:09,030
I don't know where that is, though.

4979
04:14:10,230 --> 04:14:10,930
Oh, I see him.

4980
04:14:11,090 --> 04:14:12,430
I saw a hint, yeah.

4981
04:14:15,190 --> 04:14:15,970
There we go.

4982
04:14:16,430 --> 04:14:16,870
Nice.

4983
04:14:17,210 --> 04:14:17,690
Wow.

4984
04:14:18,050 --> 04:14:18,990
What is this RNG?

4985
04:14:19,530 --> 04:14:20,310
Holy cow.

4986
04:14:21,750 --> 04:14:22,530
So good.

4987
04:14:25,470 --> 04:14:32,210
And then also, if you do stamina, or like if you do a
non-lethal with this with him he restores his health through

4988
04:14:32,210 --> 04:14:41,730
like the Sun so you have to get him really fast okay eat the
stuff that will expire yeah I mean the Kenyan crab pretty

4989
04:14:41,730 --> 04:15:02,650
tasty nice where is he now where'd he go if he stays in this
area is cheating oh shit Oh, he's back!

4990
04:15:04,530 --> 04:15:05,490
That's funny.

4991
04:15:05,790 --> 04:15:08,730
He fucking came back to the same area.

4992
04:15:09,390 --> 04:15:10,130
He fucking...

4993
04:15:10,130 --> 04:15:10,910
Get his ass!

4994
04:15:11,510 --> 04:15:12,350
Get his ass!

4995
04:15:12,510 --> 04:15:13,210
Wait, what did he draw?

4996
04:15:13,570 --> 04:15:14,430
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4997
04:15:14,870 --> 04:15:18,350
He fucking went back to the same zone.

4998
04:15:18,910 --> 04:15:21,370
He was literally there and he came back.

4999
04:15:23,670 --> 04:15:25,110
What if he does it again?

5000
04:15:25,570 --> 04:15:26,490
Oh, I see it.

5001
04:15:27,230 --> 04:15:27,670
Ducky.

5002
04:15:28,890 --> 04:15:29,910
Where is he?

5003
04:15:31,430 --> 04:15:43,470
the end yeah if he stays in this area that's so messed up I
was chasing him everywhere the first time I beat him it was

5004
04:15:43,470 --> 04:15:52,190
super fast and I had good RNG the second time I was losing
him everywhere I see him I see Ducky yeah I mean he's not

5005
04:15:52,190 --> 04:16:00,750
here anymore unless he's right behind me he is right behind
me What's the right vibe?

5006
04:16:01,870 --> 04:16:04,570
No, no glints.

5007
04:16:05,670 --> 04:16:06,650
Yeah, I don't see anything.

5008
04:16:10,270 --> 04:16:12,430
I'm just gonna grab some food real quick.

5009
04:16:12,590 --> 04:16:13,730
Oh, I should just eat the...

5010
04:16:14,330 --> 04:16:16,870
I should just eat the toxic mushrooms.

5011
04:16:17,590 --> 04:16:18,510
They're not toxic.

5012
04:16:18,950 --> 04:16:20,650
The radioactive mushrooms.

5013
04:16:21,530 --> 04:16:22,050
Radioactive!

5014
04:16:22,550 --> 04:16:23,890
Oh, there's a frog too.

5015
04:16:24,690 --> 04:16:25,830
I think he moved.

5016
04:16:26,370 --> 04:16:27,690
I think he might have, yeah.

Why did they all explode?

5085
04:21:53,820 --> 04:22:00,000
Oh no, I don't mean the explosion there's kind of like a
theory on the explosion but yeah why the tree opens up like

5086
04:22:00,000 --> 04:22:08,780
that's just kind of random because like his power of the
forest you know the power of the forest when he dies then no

one controls the forest no oh hey there's a goat yeah these

5105
04:22:55,460 --> 04:22:57,100

04:23:08,300 --> 04:23:09,320

5117
04:23:16,620 --> 04:23:17,980

04:27:32,240 --> 04:27:35,360
It's a Japanese movie where the world ends in a nuclear war.

5178
04:27:36,620 --> 04:27:38,820
Tensions between east and west reach the breaking point.

5179
04:27:39,180 --> 04:27:41,920
And before anyone can stop it, they launch the ICBMs.

5180
04:27:43,140 --> 04:27:45,560
Humanity is wiped out by a war that no one wanted.

5181
04:27:45,920 --> 04:27:46,400
Oh, no.

5182
04:27:46,700 --> 04:27:48,940
It depicts that destruction from the eyes of ordinary
people.

5183
04:27:49,360 --> 04:27:52,960
Their simple daily lives are torn apart by the terrible...

5184
04:27:52,960 --> 04:28:01,760
Oh, it's like the Kojima game where no one has the
achievement where everyone disarms their nuclear bomb.

5185
04:28:02,300 --> 04:28:03,600
Oh, that's Metal Gear.

5186
04:28:04,020 --> 04:28:04,380
Yeah.

5187
04:28:05,080 --> 04:28:05,580
Yeah.

5188
04:28:07,060 --> 04:28:08,120
All right.

5189
04:28:09,180 --> 04:28:11,260
Let's test this theory out.

5190
04:28:12,060 --> 04:28:13,620
You should roll, do a flip.

5191
04:28:14,060 --> 04:28:14,100
Yeah!

5192
04:28:20,850 --> 04:28:22,150
They don't even...

5193
04:28:22,170 --> 04:28:24,350
Oh my God.

5194
04:28:27,920 --> 04:28:29,520
One more time!

5195
04:28:32,540 --> 04:28:33,860
Uh...

5196
04:28:33,860 --> 04:28:34,520
Uh...

5197
04:28:38,300 --> 04:28:41,260
Clown, dokey bird, clown.

5198
04:28:44,740 --> 04:28:47,240
One more time!

5199
04:28:51,060 --> 04:28:54,020
I told you it was a final boss.

5200
04:28:57,900 --> 04:28:59,920
She doesn't even...

5201
04:28:59,920 --> 04:29:00,900
Oh, okay, okay.

5202
04:29:01,100 --> 04:29:01,620
Yeah, she does.

5203
04:29:02,040 --> 04:29:03,780
At least I have background music.

5204
04:29:09,020 --> 04:29:09,340
Yeah.

5205
04:29:09,980 --> 04:29:11,880
What a thrill.

5206
04:29:21,300 --> 04:29:22,460
Come on, Doki, sing along.

5207
04:29:23,100 --> 04:29:26,600
What a fear in my heart.

5208
04:29:28,660 --> 04:29:31,020
But you are so supreme.

5209
04:29:33,300 --> 04:29:36,600
I give my life

5210
04:29:40,470 --> 04:29:52,990
for you Snake eater In my time There'll be no fight

5211
04:29:59,350 --> 04:30:19,930
It's the way to you I'm still In a dream Snake eater Oh my
god, how am I still climbing?

5212
04:30:21,210 --> 04:30:25,610
I'm still in our dreams.

5213
04:30:27,150 --> 04:30:29,530
Snake in the air.

5214
04:30:34,600 --> 04:30:40,620
Do it again, again, again.

5215
04:30:40,700 --> 04:30:49,240
We are walking through this door because I found out that...

5216
04:30:50,880 --> 04:30:59,460
again again and then we save here oh my god we're about to
get to the vultures that will eat the people and then if you

5217
04:30:59,460 --> 04:31:10,960

to save yes i do okay okay have you ever seen forbidden

5218
04:31:10,960 --> 04:31:18,960
planet forbidden planet our last fun fact it's about this
expedition that goes to the king in an ultra fast spaceship

5219
04:31:18,960 --> 04:31:23,360
when they arrive of the last expedition, Dr. Morbius.

5220
04:31:24,340 --> 04:31:29,540
Dr. Morbius was exploring the planet along with his
daughter, Altera, and the versatile Robbie the Robot.

5221
04:31:30,640 --> 04:31:31,440
Robbie the Robot.

5222
04:31:32,180 --> 04:31:36,420
The Expedition Team is suddenly attacked by an invisible
creature called the Monster from the Id.

5223
04:31:37,340 --> 04:31:40,140
The special effects they use for the science stuff were
really neat.

5224
04:31:40,200 --> 04:31:40,560
Cool.

5225
04:31:40,740 --> 04:31:43,920
I wish I had a robot like Robbie that could make anything I
wanted it to.

5226
04:31:44,620 --> 04:31:45,000
Ah.

5227
04:31:45,180 --> 04:31:46,800
I'm interested in that invisible monster.

5228
04:31:47,560 --> 04:31:49,860
If I were invisible, I wouldn't have to bother hiding.

5229
04:31:49,880 --> 04:31:50,680
That's so true.

5230
04:31:50,880 --> 04:32:03,420
camouflage maybe so true yeah that'll be the day oh yeah
baby all right i think this is a good time to cut we got two

5231
04:32:03,420 --> 04:32:11,780
snake eat three technically three snake eater songs today
yeah and you got three bosses that's crazy oh that's true

5232
04:32:11,780 --> 04:32:19,780
yeah and then four if you count ocelot oh yeah five if you
count the ladder yeah me beating the ladder boss twice too

5233
04:32:19,780 --> 04:32:28,380
in the room yeah yeah six six six bosses today six bosses
today that's crazy and then like there's a huge gap till the

5234
04:32:28,380 --> 04:32:34,220
next boss right oh there's a bit of a gap yeah yeah because
like i i was surprised because i was like i thought they

5235
04:32:34,220 --> 04:32:42,760
would they would like pace the pace all three of the the
bosses for those guys but i was like it's not really a huge

5236
04:32:42,760 --> 04:32:48,620
gap but it's um It's a really annoying area.

5237
04:32:49,280 --> 04:32:51,200
Oh, okay.

5238
04:32:51,660 --> 04:32:52,600
Okay, I guess.

5239
04:32:53,020 --> 04:32:53,900
I mean, you know what?

5240
04:32:53,980 --> 04:32:54,920
We made a lot of progress.

5241
04:32:55,080 --> 04:32:55,700
Is this halfway?

5242
04:32:55,920 --> 04:32:57,600
People are saying like, this is halfway.

5243
04:32:58,320 --> 04:32:59,520
Or we're almost at halfway.

5244
04:33:01,180 --> 04:33:01,680
Yeah.

5245
04:33:02,180 --> 04:33:02,700
Oh.

5246
04:33:03,620 --> 04:33:05,040
I think you're really zooming.

5247
04:33:05,440 --> 04:33:07,480
Yeah, I think I'm just shooting everything.

5248
04:33:08,120 --> 04:33:08,740
Yeah, yeah.

5249
04:33:09,000 --> 04:33:09,620
It's great.

5250
04:33:10,300 --> 04:33:12,820
I'm just like, I did do a stealth.

5251
04:33:12,960 --> 04:33:15,340
I did do a stealthily at one.

5252
04:33:15,360 --> 04:33:23,160
point just regret burning the bodies after but like you know
it was technically stealth i feel like you could get it done

5253
04:33:23,160 --> 04:33:29,700
in next stream wait really like i feel like the first time
we you played you were very much getting used to it and just

5254
04:33:29,700 --> 04:33:35,160
kind of whatever but i feel like you could finish it next
stream oh okay yeah i think so too we could do it next week

5255
04:33:35,160 --> 04:33:45,020
actually then we could finish it right let me see yeah let's
check your schedule we will talk we'll talk after it was i

5256
04:33:45,020 --> 04:33:48,000
next Yeah, the week after, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5257
04:33:48,820 --> 04:33:51,980
Self means no witnesses, so I had to burn the bodies right
after.

5258
04:33:52,760 --> 04:33:53,500
Oh, it's so true.

5259
04:33:53,680 --> 04:33:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

5260
04:33:54,200 --> 04:33:55,480
They don't, like, burn.

5261
04:33:56,120 --> 04:33:59,760
Yeah, they technically burn so hard that they turn into
ashes.

5262
04:33:59,900 --> 04:34:00,860
If you think about it.

5263
04:34:01,300 --> 04:34:02,560
But I don't see any ashes.

5264
04:34:02,820 --> 04:34:05,820
Oh, the ashes also got burnt to the crisp.

5265
04:34:06,140 --> 04:34:08,920
I burned the ashes, so then it burns into nothing.

5266
04:34:09,980 --> 04:34:10,360
Oh.

5267
04:34:10,620 --> 04:34:11,580
Yeah, yeah, that's how it goes.

5268
04:34:11,760 --> 04:34:13,880
Yeah, we made a lot of progress, guys.

5269
04:34:14,000 --> 04:34:15,000

5274
04:34:45,360 --> 04:34:46,720
You only died once.

5275

Yeah, yeah.

5276
04:34:47,480 --> 04:34:49,040
Only died once, technically.

5277
04:34:50,860 --> 04:34:52,220
I'm going to cheat cheese, everyone.

5278
04:34:52,620 --> 04:34:54,740
Men and I are going to pass out now.

Oh, as always, everybody, I'm so tired.

5282
04:35:02,720 --> 04:35:04,980
I think it's a help that I'm also sick, too, I think.

5283
04:35:05,480 --> 04:35:10,720
So, like, my energy is a lot, like, I replenish my energy a
lot faster.

5284
04:35:11,240 --> 04:35:13,840
But as always, everybody, say hydrated, posture check.

5285
04:35:14,160 --> 04:35:14,940
Get up and move around.

5286
04:35:15,360 --> 04:35:21,660
blood flow and you stay up for me and mint head to bed
because you deserve it but having a very fun but honestly

5287
04:35:21,660 --> 04:35:29,460
i've been having really fun with metal gear so far yes i'm
glad i'm slowly understanding the metal gear references and

5288
04:35:29,460 --> 04:35:38,420
also i i sort of i understand the ocelot thing now i i get
it like the fact that he wore the bullet like the bullet as

5289
04:35:38,420 --> 04:35:41,500
a necklace like i was like oh Oh, no, they're in love.

5290
04:35:41,560 --> 04:35:43,840
He's in, yeah, he's like, he's in deep.

5291
04:35:44,340 --> 04:35:46,700
Yeah, he's in deep, deep.

5292
04:35:48,800 --> 04:35:51,980
And it's, and he was saying, it's forbidden love, too.

5293
04:35:52,080 --> 04:35:54,820
He's like, I can't love an American dog.

5294
04:35:55,220 --> 04:35:58,220
But then secretly, he's like, oh, no.

5295
04:36:01,140 --> 04:36:02,020
It's forbidden.

5296
04:36:02,840 --> 04:36:05,280
So then after this game, you're going to play the first two,
right?

5297
04:36:07,460 --> 04:36:08,480
We'll talk later.

5298
04:36:08,560 --> 04:36:09,300
We'll talk later.

5299
04:36:11,360 --> 04:36:13,760
You have to see more of Ocelot.

5300
04:36:14,200 --> 04:36:20,980
Wait, but then he's not, he's not like a cute, like, he's
not like a cute young man.

5301
04:36:21,380 --> 04:36:22,100
What do you mean he's not a cute?

5302
04:36:22,180 --> 04:36:24,280
Yeah, he's going to be an old man.

5303
04:36:24,520 --> 04:36:26,520
Isn't he an old man in other games?

5304
04:36:26,880 --> 04:36:28,280
That's even cuter.

5305
04:36:32,720 --> 04:36:34,840
Yeah, old, old man love.

5306
04:36:35,980 --> 04:36:37,440
Yeah, exactly.

5307
04:36:38,160 --> 04:36:39,080
Oh, yeah, okay.

5308
04:36:39,340 --> 04:36:39,720
Okay.

5309
04:36:39,880 --> 04:36:41,360
Think of the old man.

5310
04:36:42,160 --> 04:36:42,220
Yeah.

5311
04:36:45,020 --> 04:36:51,480
I'm slowly understanding the Metal Gear references the
moment I saw the ladder I was like oh that's where the

5312
04:36:51,480 --> 04:37:01,980
ladder came from that's where the metal gear references oh
yeah the slow burn the ultra slow burn it is like the

5313
04:37:01,980 --> 04:37:12,820
ultimate slow burn it lasts decades that's true that's true
even after the cold war ended it's still going on it's going

5314
04:37:12,820 --> 04:37:20,940
on that's so true anyways we're gonna head off now hope you
guys had a fun time watching bye bye everyone bye bye bye
