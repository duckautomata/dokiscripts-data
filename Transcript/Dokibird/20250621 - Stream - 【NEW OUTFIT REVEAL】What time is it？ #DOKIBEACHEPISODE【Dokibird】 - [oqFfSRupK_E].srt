1
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,120
Oh, sorry about that.

2
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,920
Oh, can you pass the ball back?

3
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,620
Hey, uh...

4
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,800
You okay there, buddy?

5
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,060
Oh, man.

6
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,400
Oh, you...

7
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,580
Sorry, I did not see you, Dragoon.

8
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,120
Oh, hey.

9
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:04,940
Hey.

10
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,420
You're not gonna sue, right?

11
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,340
It was just an accident.

12
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,260
Hey, come on.

13
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,920
It's just, like, a flesh wound, right?

14
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,240
You didn't have a concussion or anything.

15
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,060
Come on, it was just a beach ball.

16
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,080
Come on, get up, Dragoon.

17
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,200
Come on.

18
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,940
Dragoon?

19
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Oh, come on.

20
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,220
Are you okay there?

21
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,860
Dragoon?

22
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,120
Hello?

23
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,600
Hello, Dragoon?

24
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,440
Oh, there you go.

25
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,820
Oh, there you go.

26
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,420
Wow.

27
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,640
Okay, you...

28
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,600
You scared me there.

29
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,580
Oh, man.

30
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,640
I thought you were never gonna wake up.

31
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,340
Hey.

32
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,860
Wait, what's this?

33
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,980
Feels like you dropped some stuff.

34
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,380
What are these?

35
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,620
Dropped a bunch of paper here.

36
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,640
Oh.

37
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,680
Wow.

38
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,260
Did you draw that, Dragoon?

39
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,040
Oh.

40
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,260
Oh.

41
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,880
Oh.

42
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:04,960
Oh.

43
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,480
Oh.

44
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:06,980
Oh.

45
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,360
Oh.

46
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,460
Oh.

47
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,540
Oh.

48
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:08,560
Oh.

49
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,580
Oh.

50
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,620
There's fan art.

51
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,160
Oh, you're those Dragoons.

52
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,740
They're probably my fan club, right?

53
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,900
Oh, yeah.

54
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,540
Yeah, the whole beach episode or whatever.

55
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh, I didn't...

56
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,780
I thought you'd be, like, you know, at home.

57
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,540
Why are you out here?

58
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,760
I'm at the beach touching sand.

59
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh, wow.

60
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,120
Oh, man.

61
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,400
I guess that's what you think I'm gonna wear, right?

62
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,800
Well, at least you got the Crocs right.

63
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,900
Oh, you also have...

64
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,320
Oh, this one from...

65
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,800
Nav.

66
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,900
Oh, man.

67
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,620
All of you guys got the Crocs right, though.

68
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,700
I guess, I mean, it's sort of obvious that, of course, I'm gonna wear Crocs.

69
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,880
Like, what else would I wear when you're walking on the beach?

70
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,860
Especially when you're touching the water.

71
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,540
The fucking fish toilet.

72
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:17,420
I like how a lot of you guys are wondering, like, what exactly type of swimwear am I gonna wear?

73
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,560
Um...

74
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,720
Uh, am I gonna wear during...

75
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,780
This beach episode.

76
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,260
I like how this one...

77
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,840
I like...

78
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,520
Oh, man, Dragon.

79
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,140
I like how this one...

80
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,440
You guys basically gave me a military gear.

81
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,280
Um...

82
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,880
A little military beret.

83
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,680
Oh, you thought...

84
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,160
Oh, my God.

85
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,020
Wait, I just noticed you guys thought that it was a beret.

86
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,080
The beach beret.

87
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm always locked in wherever I go.

88
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,940
A little...

89
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,800
A little knife for, like, in case there's a criminal at the beach.

90
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,120
Hey, still got the Crocs.

91
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,280
You guys got that correct.

92
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,620
All right, what else did you guys submitted?

93
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,060
Oh, I...

94
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,160
Oh, this one's cute.

95
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:06,940
Ooh.

96
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,300
The transparent shirt.

97
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,440
And then also the...

98
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,580
The belly button.

99
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,940
Oh.

100
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,860
How much skin is she gonna show today?

101
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,220
Crocs, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

102
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,640
Thank you.

103
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,140
Thank you.

104
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,040
See, I knew you guys weren't gonna sue me.

105
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,640
I...

106
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,300
I knew you guys weren't gonna sue me.

107
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,000
I mean, it was just a beach...

108
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
It was just a beach ball.

109
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,200
Come on.

110
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,640
That didn't hurt, guys.

111
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,380
Um...

112
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,660
And also there's the Crocs.

113
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,180
Yet again.

114
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,220
I don't think...

115
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,960
I think everybody sort of knew that...

116
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,900
I was gonna be wearing Crocs to the beach.

117
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,920
I mean, it's, like, the most efficient, anyway.

118
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,800
Uh...

119
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,700
When you're out there, um...

120
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,640
When you're out there, like, with the sand and the ocean.

121
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,880
Because the worst part is getting sand in your shoes.

122
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,880
But then if you're wearing Crocs...

123
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,340
The sand can just flow out of the holes, you know?

124
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,300
Uh...

125
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,960
Here's another one.

126
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,020
I like this one because you included Chonky Goon.

127
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh!

128
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,640
A lot of you guys realize...

129
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,540
Um...

130
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,640
For those who don't know...

131
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,940
Um...

132
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,040
All my...

133
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,020
Debut teasers...

134
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,100
My outfit teasers...

135
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,980
Always includes elements...

136
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,640
That come from my outfit.

137
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,040
So...

138
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,680
Um...

139
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,480
So...

140
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,560
Uh...

141
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,960
Some of you guys predicted it...

142
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,020
Correctly...

143
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,780
When it came to, uh...

144
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,420
The water balloons...

145
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,840
And what their purpose was.

146
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,980
So...

147
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,360
Some of you guys realized that they were water balloons...

148
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,640
And that I may or may not have some of them on me right now.

149
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,660
So...

150
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,540
But where will it...

151
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,440
Where are they gonna be?

152
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,540
Well, you guys are gonna have to look up and find out.

153
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,900
Whenever you're ready to get up.

154
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,660
Okay, Dragon, I know you're still... I know you're still on the ground right now.

155
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,040
But whenever you're ready to get up from the ground because you don't have a concussion, right?

156
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,840
You don't have a concussion and you're not going to seek any legal action on me.

157
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,800
Right, guys?

158
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:19,360
So, whenever you're able to look up and, you know, get up, then you'll know where the water balloons are.

159
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,700
Um, oh, here's another one.

160
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,760
Um, I like how Dad is, like, in my little baggie here.

161
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,400
Uh, because you guys are, like, wondering, oh, obviously, whenever I have a new outfit, Dad will also get something, too.

162
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,300
And I like that you guys put him in a little pouch there.

163
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,540
Like, you know, those types of dogs that, like, can't fucking walk.

164
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,160
Uh, well, not as in, like, they can, but they don't want to.

165
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,240
Sorry, those dogs...

166
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,280
Weird thing for me to say after what he's been through.

167
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,720
Uh-huh, but I meant with those who...

168
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,900
For the dogs that don't want to walk because they're, like, ew, sand.

169
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,800
Uh, I don't want to be, like, carried everywhere.

170
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah, the pocket dogs.

171
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,200
Uh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

172
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,060
Um, I really like that feature and I like that, yeah.

173
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,020
I like that this one is a little different from the rest because, uh, you made me tan here.

174
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,500
That was pretty neat.

175
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:11,980
Awesome.

176
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,300
Whoa, sorry.

177
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,700
Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

178
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,960
And then more Crocs.

179
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,700
I think everybody got the Crocs correctly.

180
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,560
Everyone knows what shoes they are.

181
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,020
Except...

182
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,280
Oh, yeah, see, he's still Crocs.

183
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:31,720
Haha.

184
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,260
And then...

185
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,000
This is one by...

186
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,500
Oh, this one's by Zavik.

187
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,860
Um, I love all the designs you have on my water gun.

188
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,500
Um, obviously, it's not a real gun.

189
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,560
We're at the beach.

190
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,940
I don't bring a gun to the beach.

191
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,860
Uh, it is made of water.

192
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:55,300
I love all the little designs you guys come up with for the little water gun, too, and everything.

193
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
And then, oh, I love looking at you guys.

194
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,940
You know, I love looking at these...

195
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:09,600
Oh my gosh, I love looking at these designs because they actually help me a lot coming up with, like, future outfits for my skin suit.

196
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:18,460
So, it really does help a lot when you guys do these predictions because I get to, like, you know, get inspiration for future color schemes and future ideas.

197
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,920
That one used for newer outfits.

198
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,760
Oh, wait, are these sandals?

199
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,160
Oh!

200
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,980
You won the jack!

201
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,620
You won the lottery, Maria!

202
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,340
Not Crocs!

203
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,180
Not Crocs!

204
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,640
Oh my gosh, wait, what are these in the front?

205
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,980
Are those, like, syringes?

206
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, it's like I'm collecting stuff at the sand.

207
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,660
Oh, I love the dad fit, though.

208
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,420
Like, the dad at the beach.

209
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,120
Ha ha ha ha!

210
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,920
Ha ha ha!

211
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,380
Ha ha ha!

212
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,080
Actual dad at the beach outfit.

213
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,000
May or may not be correct in your prediction.

214
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,840
Ha ha ha!

215
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,140
Ha ha ha!

216
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,060
May or may not be.

217
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,620
You're gonna have to get up to see what it really is.

218
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,760
And then this one.

219
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,800
Oh, this one's cute!

220
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,520
The little...

221
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,040
Aw!

222
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,440
The little sunglasses for dad!

223
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,720
And then, like, my little clips and my band...

224
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,580
Oh, I've always wanted, like...

225
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,260
Maybe in the...

226
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,700
Okay, I'll say that I do not have a bandaid on my face.

227
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Uh, but it is something that I really wanna do in the...

228
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,840
For the future.

229
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,820
In the future outfit.

230
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,040
To have the, like, bandaid on the nose thing.

231
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,960
Cause I feel like that's such a classic tomboy trope.

232
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,320
And I always wanted to have that for an outfit.

233
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,800
But it didn't work for this one.

234
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,960
It didn't work for this one.

235
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,860
Maybe in the future.

236
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm like, yoink!

237
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,680
My idea now.

238
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,740
Ha ha ha!

239
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,680
Ha ha ha!

240
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,080
Ha ha ha!

241
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,160
Ha ha ha!

242
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,120
Um, what else do I have here?

243
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,460
Oh, I have this one from...

244
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,240
Uh, Laszlo...

245
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,080
Laszlo Finch.

246
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,540
Oh, more Crocs.

247
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:45,840
Nice.

248
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,580
Ha ha ha!

249
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,220
Oh!

250
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,640
This time, you...

251
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,320
Instead of, like, a...

252
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,660
Some people think it's a bag.

253
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,620
Some people think it's a beach ball.

254
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,240
Well, you're gonna have to find out...

255
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,560
You're gonna have to, you know...

256
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,220
Get up from the sand to see what it really is.

257
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Ha ha ha ha!

258
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,720
Ha ha ha!

259
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,900
And then there's, like, the sling bag.

260
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,860
And everything.

261
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,320
And then there's the school book here.

262
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,260
Okay, what else do you have in this collection of paper you have here?

263
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,340
Oh, I...

264
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:11,880
I...

265
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,100
I really love the color scheme for this one.

266
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,820
I think...

267
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,460
This one's from Monfa.

268
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,000
But I love the color scheme for this Hawaiian shirt.

269
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,740
Uh, when I first saw this.

270
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,740
Ha ha ha ha!

271
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,560
The skin tight swimsuit!

272
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,460
Damn!

273
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,060
Ha ha ha!

274
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,380
Sorry, I just noticed...

275
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
I was too focused on the colors.

276
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,400
To fit...

277
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,260
See the in...

278
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,180
I was wearing on the inside!

279
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,520
Ha ha ha ha!

280
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,240
The skin tight swimsuit!

281
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,420
Ha ha ha ha!

282
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,400
Ha ha ha!

283
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,260
Thaccoon's enjoying the view.

284
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,200
That's for sure.

285
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,000
Ha ha ha ha!

286
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,060
At least...

287
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,340
At least people...

288
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,280
At least people will know...

289
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,340
That I'm not a washing board!

290
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,080
Ha ha ha!

291
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,500
I told you it was a sports bra, guys!

292
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,300
I...

293
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,020
Ha ha ha!

294
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,300
Ha ha ha!

295
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,500
Um...

296
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,860
Oh, I like...

297
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,180
Oh, wait!

298
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
I just noticed this, too!

299
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,820
There's like a...

300
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,080
There's like a bird at the end of the gun, too!

301
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,320
Oh!

302
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,340
And then there's more...

303
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,100
More Crocs!

304
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,520
Yes!

305
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,360
More Crocs!

306
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,020
I think that was the most obvious part of the whole silhouette!

307
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,500
Alright, what else?

308
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,880
What else?

309
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh, this one's cute!

310
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:16,900
Oh!

311
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,280
I love the little...

312
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,140
The little...

313
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,580
Um...

314
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,900
See-through tank top!

315
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,440
I think that's what they're called, right?

316
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,580
Um...

317
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,000
From Renkai.

318
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,420
The...

319
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,120
The little...

320
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,280
The little...

321
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,660
I like this color scheme a lot.

322
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,440
Oh, this...

323
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,760
Yoink...

324
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,340
I'm gonna...

325
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,660
Yoink my color...

326
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,340
Ha ha ha!

327
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,000
The fishnets...

328
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is it called fishnets?

329
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,660
I don't remember...

330
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,300
I don't know what they're...

331
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,900
This is called.

332
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:40,940
Um...

333
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,700
Um...

334
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,680
I really love the color scheme that you got here.

335
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,040
And now it's my color scheme.

336
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,080
Ha ha ha!

337
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:48,980
Ha ha ha!

338
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,460
Ha ha ha!

339
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,620
Ha ha ha!

340
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,660
Yeah!

341
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,380
The mesh and then the...

342
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,120
The inflatable see-through dragon...

343
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,800
And I don't know...

344
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,320
The color...

345
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,260
Color scheme...

346
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,560
And the combination for this is really, really cute.

347
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,460
And then like the...

348
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,300
The swim trunks with the little like palm leaves and everything.

349
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,660
Um...

350
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,820
And then my crocs with the...

351
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,460
The gibbets.

352
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,260
I recently found out what these are called.

353
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,760
They're called little gibbets.

354
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,240
But...

355
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,140
That's so cute.

356
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,900
Oh...

357
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,460
Aw, man.

358
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,520
That's a good idea.

359
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
Maybe like...

360
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,040
A future product...

361
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,860
Since I am wearing crocs right now...

362
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,580
That maybe we can have like...

363
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,260
You know...

364
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,700
Crotchet bits in the future.

365
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,680
Uh...

366
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:24,940
Ha ha!

367
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,180
Ha ha ha ha!

368
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,320
Yoink!

369
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,620
Ha ha ha ha!

370
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,040
Ha ha ha!

371
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,900
Ha ha ha!

372
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,120
Ha ha ha!

373
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,420
And then the little inflatable dragon is so cute though!

374
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,420
Look at him!

375
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,500
Look at that little guy!

376
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,100
Alright, what else do I have in here?

377
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,920
What else?

378
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,580
Uh...

379
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,280
Did I look at this?

380
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,940
Oh, I already did.

381
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,640
Uh...

382
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,820
What about this one?

383
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,120
Oh!

384
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,360
This one's from...

385
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,180
Saria.

386
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,320
Aw, look!

387
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,020
Aw, like...

388
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,420
I like...

389
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,060
You know how like...

390
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,200
A lot of these like...

391
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,680
Since we're doing a beach...

392
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,260
A beach episode...

393
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,720
Like all the outfits are like...

394
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,420
Very tropical theme and everything.

395
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,800
So I do...

396
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,580
Oh my god!

397
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,660
Wait, I actually like these shoes.

398
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,080
Look at these.

399
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,200
The dragoon crocs.

400
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,980
The little faces in the front too.

401
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,440
Aw!

402
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,760
And then there's a tomato there!

403
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,700
Aw, that's so cute!

404
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,320
A little tomato for the end...

405
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,200
For like the...

406
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,480
The...

407
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,820
The green thing.

408
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,880
That's cute.

409
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,160
Yeah, see I told you.

410
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,040
It's a sports bra.

411
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,440
Ha ha ha ha!

412
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,560
It's...

413
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,160
I didn't stuff the chest!

414
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,640
It's all natural, chat.

415
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,800
Dragoons.

416
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,920
It's all natural, guys.

417
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,360
And then...

418
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,640
Um...

419
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,420
Um...

420
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,340
I definitely love this part the most too.

421
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,640
Ha ha ha ha!

422
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,220
I love this part too.

423
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,200
Wait, is this a...

424
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,500
Aw!

425
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,400
And then there's like a...

426
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,460
A waterproof dragoon watch.

427
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,500
A waterproof apple.

428
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,000
Wait.

429
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,720
Dragoon watch.

430
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

431
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,120
Um...

432
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,760
And then a little dragoon beach bar.

433
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,560
And my little bag and everything.

434
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,800
That's so cute.

435
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,320
Oh my gosh.

436
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,300
You guys have some really nice outfit predictions.

437
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
They're all really fucking adorable, chat.

438
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:00,900
Uh...

439
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,440
Ha ha ha ha!

440
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
Alright, what's about...

441
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,440
This one?

442
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,060
This one is from...

443
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,220
Ooh!

444
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,080
There's a lot of them.

445
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,280
This one from Cassia.

446
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,280
There's a lot of choices here.

447
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:10,680
Ooh!

448
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,100
Oh!

449
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,540
One of them is like a full scuba diving outfit.

450
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,560
For my scuba gear.

451
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,440
Or the like...

452
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,980
Wetsuit.

453
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,840
And then there's one with the chonky goon beach bar.

454
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,200
And then there's dad in a bag.

455
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,180
Uh...

456
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,600
There's nothing exaggerated!

457
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,460
Okay?

458
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,060
None of...

459
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,860
All these concepts are very real.

460
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,680
Uh...

461
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,300
Ha ha ha!

462
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,640
They're all a part of me.

463
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,180
Uh...

464
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,160
Surely in one of the Doki verses you will have these...

465
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,620
This outfit.

466
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,580
Um...

467
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,860
And then I like that the creativity since I was wearing a scuba gear.

468
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,680
Um...

469
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,300
In the silhouette.

470
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,020
He did show like...

471
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,380
You know...

472
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,200
A little diving suit too.

473
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,900
As well.

474
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,500
And then there's like the...

475
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,560
The little...

476
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:47,960
Uh...

477
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,700
Little...

478
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,400
What are we called?

479
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,640
The...

480
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,460
Privileged bag dogs.

481
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,580
Ha ha ha!

482
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:53,880
Ha ha ha!

483
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,080
Ha ha ha!

484
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,260
Ha ha ha!

485
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,260
Oh!

486
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,420
And there's a little egg in there in my pocket!

487
00:25:59,720 --> 00:25:59,980
Oh!

488
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,800
I hope I don't accidentally scramble him.

489
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,160
Ha ha ha ha!

490
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:03,640
Ha ha ha!

491
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,000
Ha ha ha!

492
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,560
Ha ha ha!

493
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,000
Ha ha ha!

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,060
All right.

495
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,500
We'll look at one more guys.

496
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,760
One more outfit prediction.

497
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,160
Uh...

498
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,740
Oh...

499
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,560
Oh my god.

500
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,060
You guys are so many too.

501
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:13,940
Oh!

502
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,960
I'll do this one.

503
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,580
This one is by...

504
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,360
Uh...

505
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,760
Yami.

506
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,860
I like how you...

507
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,120
Oh!

508
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,460
You included like a little surfboard too!

509
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,400
Uh...

510
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,780
I cannot surf though.

511
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,840
I hate to break it to you guys, dragons.

512
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,040
I...

513
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,300
I don't know how to...

514
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,800
I don't actually know how to surf.

515
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,580
I feel...

516
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,640
I think you have to have like really good balance for it too.

517
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,240
Um...

518
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,780
And like...

519
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,120
Uh...

520
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,820
And like...

521
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,660
I remember like...

522
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,900
Yeah, you have to have really, really good balance for that shit.

523
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
And I don't have that.

524
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,300
I've done like those like balancing tests.

525
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,580
Um...

526
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,600
Where you have to like walk across like...

527
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,280
Walk across like a really thin like wooden board.

528
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,260
Um...

529
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,820
And I did not do so well.

530
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,480
Like if I...

531
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,980
It was like...

532
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,920
Oh, pretend you're crossing across like a cliff or something.

533
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,720
And you're doing those, like, you know, those, like, um, adrenaline junkies where they walk across, like, a tightrope and stuff.

534
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:15,300
So there was, like, this little test where it's, like, it goes from, like, a little wooden board and then a tightrope and then, like, um...

535
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,400
And then, like, it gets skinnier and skinnier.

536
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,600
And I did not... I... I... If I... If it was real life, I would have died after two seconds.

537
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,300
I... I... I took, like, two steps and I was off the cliff.

538
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,600
I was...

539
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,440
It... It did not go so well.

540
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,540
It...

541
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Um... Um... But yeah, I really love the cute idea of having a surfboard next to me and then the little...

542
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,480
The little tomato water balloons and everything and then I'm choking the dragoon beach ball.

543
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,380
Anyway...

544
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,360
Dragoon, can you... Can you get up now?

545
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,420
Are you... Are you okay?

546
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,220
Remember, you're not gonna sue me, right?

547
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,520
It was... It was like, you know, just a little bump on the head.

548
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,720
Um... You already had that...

549
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,120
Um... You already had a headache before you came here, remember?

550
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,300
Come on!

551
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,160
Come on!

552
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,080
You already had a headache because you were drinking earlier, weren't you?

553
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,800
Yeah, your... Your buddies were telling me.

554
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,300
Uh... Your buddies were telling me that you were drinking earlier at the bar.

555
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,680
So, like, come on.

556
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
Like, you had that headache already, guys.

557
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,080
Come on.

558
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,680
So, like, why don't you get up?

559
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,160
Yeah?

560
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,080
Why don't you get up?

561
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,120
Look, we can... Look...

562
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,560
If you want, I will write my fake... I mean, my real number to you.

563
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,620
So, like, you know, if you do have to go to a hospital, you can call me.

564
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,700
And then, like, my insurance will cover it.

565
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,740
Um... And I definitely have insurance.

566
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,140
Don't worry, Dragoon.

567
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,440
So, like, why don't you... Why don't you, like, get up?

568
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,180
Come on.

569
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,200
Yeah, that's right.

570
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,100
You're doing it.

571
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:55,780
All right.

572
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,020
Get up, Dragoon.

573
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,140
Come on.

574
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,960
All right.

575
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,380
You're almost there.

576
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,860
Come on.

577
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,640
That's... You're still at my legs.

578
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,120
You're still at my feet.

579
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,400
Are you staring at my ankle bracelet?

580
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,840
That's... That's a little weird.

581
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,760
That's... We're not in the 1950s anymore.

582
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,380
We can show our ankles now.

583
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,580
Come on.

584
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,480
Can't be that... Come on.

585
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,680
Oh my gosh, you're... It's very slow.

586
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,680
Yes, that skin.

587
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,740
Yes, I have... Of course, it's the beach.

588
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,300
I'm not gonna wear long pants at the beach, Dragoon.

589
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,760
Um... You're scaring me.

590
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,520
Um... I don't... I don't know...

591
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,460
Um... Okay, I'll let you in on a little secret.

592
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,680
I may or may not have insurance.

593
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,960
So, um... I really need you to be able to get up, Dragoon.

594
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,260
Um...

595
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,180
All right.

596
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,400
All right, all right, all right.

597
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,800
Come on.

598
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,200
Come on.

599
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,460
You're almost there.

600
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,740
Oh!

601
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,420
Yep!

602
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,980
Those are my knees now!

603
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:06,880
Yep!

604
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,520
Oh!

605
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,480
You wanna see my gun?

606
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,080
Yes!

607
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,700
Oh, yes!

608
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,080
That's a very real gun!

609
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,240
So, if you don't get up...

610
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,320
On the count of five, Dragoon!

611
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,380
Then...

612
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,960
I hate to say it, but...

613
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,520
I don't like witnesses.

614
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,380
I'm joking.

615
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,320
It's just water.

616
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,560
Don't worry, Dragoon.

617
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:28,840
It's...

618
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,940
It's just water.

619
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,320
See?

620
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,080
It's my little water gun here.

621
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,460
Oh!

622
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,760
Yeah!

623
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,480
Doki Bird.

624
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,540
From my Doki...

625
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,300
What does it say?

626
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:40,980
Oh, hey!

627
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,460
You can see my nails now!

628
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,200
Whoa!

629
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,760
Yeah!

630
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,420
You can see my nails, guys!

631
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,100
Black nails!

632
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,220
My black nail polish!

633
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,540
I went to the...

634
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,920
Oh, I went to get a manicure before I came here.

635
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,020
But yeah!

636
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,740
Oh, you see my shirt?

637
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,620
Yeah!

638
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,420
Yeah!

639
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,200
I made it myself!

640
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,760
From the Doki Bird brand!

641
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,620
Uh...

642
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,020
Like that!

643
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,340
Oh, you wanna see more?

644
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:09,840
Alright!

645
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
If you get up...

646
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,340
If you get up and you promise not to sue me...

647
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,080
Maybe you can see more of these clothes!

648
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,320
And maybe I'll give you a free sample, too!

649
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,740
It comes in all shapes and sizes!

650
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:20,820
Alright!

651
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,440
Let me...

652
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:21,820
Come on!

653
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,840
You got this!

654
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,520
Oh!

655
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,420
Yep!

656
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,600
That's my other hand!

657
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,740
Right here!

658
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,580
Hahaha!

659
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:28,840
Hahaha!

660
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:29,840
Yeah!

661
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,260
Of course I named my brand...

662
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,400
Brand over me!

663
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,040
That's how branding works!

664
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,940
They'll be like...

665
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,100
Whoa!

666
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,960
Where'd you get it?

667
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,420
Oh!

668
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,560
It's Doki Bird from...

669
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,100
Doki Bird by Doki Bird?

670
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,840
What do you think Calvin Klein is?

671
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,420
You think Calvin Klein...

672
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,380
Is like...

673
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,480
A made up thing?

674
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:44,740
No!

675
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,900
It's his fucking name!

676
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,000
Calvin Klein by Calvin Klein!

677
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,360
That's what Louis Vuitton is!

678
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,460
Louis Vuitton by Louis Vuitton!

679
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,660
Of course it's Doki Bird by Doki Bird!

680
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,480
Doki Bird!

681
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,060
Hehehehehehe!

682
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,760
Hehehehe!

683
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,860
Hehehehe!

684
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,080
But yeah...

685
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,580
Oooh!

686
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,540
Oh!

687
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,060
You can see like the little dongles from my pants too!

688
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,060
Yeah!

689
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,420
Marked by Marc Jacobs!

690
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:07,940
Exactly!

691
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,400
I mean my clothes!

692
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,780
If my clothing brand like hits it big...

693
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,300
They'll be like...

694
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,780
Oh my god!

695
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,640
Who's Doki Bird?

696
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,740
Oh my god...

697
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,600
Where did you get that?

698
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,240
Yeah, I got it from Doki Bird.

699
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,240
Yeah, it's Doki Bird by Doki Bird.

700
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,220
Oh, you like the physics?

701
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,100
Yeah?

702
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,560
Don't worry, there's more physics later on.

703
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,240
Don't worry, Dragoon.

704
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,180
You promise you won't sue.

705
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,740
There's more physics where that come from.

706
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,640
I just need you to look up.

707
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:42,940
Whoa.

708
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,020
Come on.

709
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,060
Whoa.

710
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,600
Going very slow.

711
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,700
Whoa.

712
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,980
Oh, you see that?

713
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,320
Oh, you can sort of see the physics already, guys.

714
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,960
So...

715
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,200
So, remember a long time ago...

716
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,080
Back during the visage streams.

717
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,080
And...

718
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,180
Back during...

719
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,180
Back during the visage streams.

720
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,520
And...

721
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,060
And I was showing...

722
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,800
This...

723
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,780
To Mint.

724
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,420
And she was like...

725
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,020
What the fuck are those?

726
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,330
And I was like...

727
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,110
Oh, don't worry.

728
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,870
They have physics too.

729
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,530
You gotta always be prepared for a fight, Dragoons.

730
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,650
That's all I'll say.

731
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,170
Those are my...

732
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,450
You guys like my physics?

733
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,150
My jiggle physics?

734
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:54,690
Whoa.

735
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,530
There's so much water in here.

736
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,370
Whoa.

737
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,970
It's extra squishy.

738
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,170
Yeah.

739
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,310
Boing.

740
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,230
Boing.

741
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,210
Boing.

742
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,170
Boing.

743
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,150
Whoa.

744
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,150
Is this the physics you guys wanted?

745
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,510
There's more than two.

746
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,970
I think there's four.

747
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,090
Whoa.

748
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,370
You know what they say.

749
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,670
Four balloons better than two.

750
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,470
I mean...

751
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,770
Come on.

752
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,730
You have two hands.

753
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,910
What are you gonna do it for?

754
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:27,930
Four.

755
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,670
It's...

756
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,250
I mean, you could fill it up with tomato juice too, if you wanted to.

757
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,290
Like, if you're...

758
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,730
If you really wanna win the war.

759
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,390
But...

760
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:43,630
You sure?

761
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,770
Yeah, they're balloons.

762
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,370
Look at that.

763
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,850
Whoa.

764
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,750
I mean, you don't know what's actually in there until I throw it at you.

765
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,110
So, like, it could be cat pee.

766
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,450
You guys...

767
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,550
You guys heard about that?

768
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:56,650
Like...

769
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,350
Um...

770
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:01,210
I think, like, some guy got arrested for throwing, like, cat pee at people.

771
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,210
Um...

772
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,370
I remember...

773
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,570
I remember, like, reading an article about it.

774
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:17,470
But, like, some guy was, like, throwing, like, water balloons filled with, like, cat pee at, like, random strangers at the beach.

775
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,590
So, like, that's gonna be...

776
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,450
But that's a story.

777
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,030
Oh, wait!

778
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,370
Oh, you see that?

779
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,230
Sorry, it's the summer, so...

780
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,190
Uh...

781
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,850
So, like, since, you know...

782
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,190
I'm Doki Bird.

783
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,690
You know, like, during...

784
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,550
During the winter, I was, like, molting.

785
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,930
So, like...

786
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,370
Uh...

787
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,230
So, you know how, like, some...

788
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,210
Some birds have, like, less feathers.

789
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:46,750
Uh...

790
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,750
During...

791
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,430
Wait...

792
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,190
Wait, actually, wait.

793
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,530
Do I know bird biology?

794
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,250
Give me a sec.

795
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,390
I might need to fact check this.

796
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,630
Okay, I'm a special bird.

797
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,390
Um...

798
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,670
But during the winter, I was molting.

799
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,670
So, like, when I was molting, um...

800
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,850
I didn't have my...

801
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,930
I didn't have my tail feathers.

802
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,410
But I'm Doki Bird.

803
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,810
So, like, obviously, you know, as a...

804
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,910
As an actual bird.

805
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,230
Uh...

806
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,590
I'm trying to remember my birdology.

807
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,350
Um...

808
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,730
But, like, I didn't have my tail feathers.

809
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,590
But, like, during the...

810
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,530
It's, like, during the summer, it just comes out.

811
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,850
It just grows out, you know?

812
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:23,970
Um...

813
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,710
Yes, I have a little bump in the...

814
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,450
In my back.

815
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,110
Um...

816
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,610
It's very tight.

817
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,490
It doesn't...

818
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:28,870
It's, like...

819
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,950
Okay, so, like...

820
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,430
You know how, like, when it gets warmer, the bulge...

821
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,450
Okay, how do I explain this properly?

822
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,190
When...

823
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,550
When it gets warmer, the...

824
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,310
The bulge grows.

825
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,370
And then feathers come out.

826
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,330
But when it's colder, like, my feathers come off.

827
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,990
Like, I just shed it all out.

828
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,150
Because I don't need it anymore.

829
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,270
Um...

830
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,830
Because, like, you know, when it's winter, I don't go outside.

831
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,830
And I hibernate a little bit.

832
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,930
Like, I half hibernate and I stay inside.

833
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,470
So I don't need to use my tail feathers.

834
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,490
Um...

835
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,770
To warm myself up.

836
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,150
And...

837
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,870
Please stop!

838
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,090
So, like...

839
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,870
During the summer...

840
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,550
Um...

841
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,130
My birdology...

842
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,370
Biol...

843
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,370
My birdology...

844
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,310
Physiology...

845
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,210
Realized...

846
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,090
Oh, it's summertime.

847
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,330
What time is it?

848
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,330
It's summertime.

849
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,130
It's our vacation.

850
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,570
I actually forgot I had to tell just now.

851
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,210
Um...

852
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:25,750
Um...

853
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,630
Um...

854
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,290
Uh...

855
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,050
So...

856
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,330
Does it sound like I'm making up as I go?

857
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,730
That's insulting.

858
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,790
I had to live with this for my whole life.

859
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,330
How dare you imply that I made it up as I made it up just now.

860
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:39,690
Anyway...

861
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,330
So, like...

862
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,390
During the summer...

863
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,070
Um...

864
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,050
The bulge starts growing back...

865
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,330
Uh...

866
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:44,930
On my back.

867
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,110
And because they're like, Oh my god, it's getting warmer.

868
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:47,950
We need...

869
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,390
We...

870
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,170
We need to...

871
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,530
Fly to the south.

872
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,370
So...

873
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:57,130
I mean, not fly...

874
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,030
Not fly to the south.

875
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,410
Sorry.

876
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,510
That's the winner.

877
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,250
I mean...

878
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:00,910
I mean...

879
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,050
Oh, it's getting warmer.

880
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,450
You can have your tail now.

881
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,210
Anyway...

882
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,350
Anyway...

883
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,190
Um...

884
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,850
Anyway...

885
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,190
That's why I have a tail during the summer.

886
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,730
Um...

887
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,450
No idea...

888
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,030
Um...

889
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,770
Okay...

890
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,930
Yeah, so I can do my little tail...

891
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,570
My little bird dance too, you know?

892
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,530
I can like poof up and be like,

893
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,650
What is she happy about?

894
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:44,470
I forgot I had... No, I can't believe you are thinking... I can't believe you guys think I forgot I have a tail.

895
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:51,470
So now I'm trying to figure out how to include this tail lore into the Doki-verse.

896
00:38:51,870 --> 00:39:00,430
But for this particular skin suit, the easiest way to remember is winter no tail, summer tail.

897
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,710
My tail lore.

898
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,310
Alright, anyway, let me go up now.

899
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,850
Woah, look at that.

900
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,690
Yeah, oh my god, look at this bounce.

901
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:16,810
Woah.

902
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,290
Alright, sorry, I love playing around with that physic.

903
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,930
Woah.

904
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,490
Anyway, it is getting a little hot though, so I might have to...

905
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:29,810
Woah.

906
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:38,870
It is getting just a little hot, so I might have to... Let me just take this off a little.

907
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,510
Oh man, it's getting really, really hot, guys.

908
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,350
So I'll take off my shirt a little bit.

909
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,430
Can you hold that, Dragon?

910
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,430
Yeah, you can hold that for me for a little bit, right, guys?

911
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,290
Alright.

912
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,010
Woah.

913
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:58,890
Woah.

914
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:58,950
Woah.

915
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,250
Woah.

916
00:39:59,250 --> 00:39:59,950
You're almost there.

917
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,010
Come on, you're almost back up.

918
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,270
I believe in you.

919
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,630
You're almost back up.

920
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,010
Woah.

921
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,610
Woah, come on.

922
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,710
Just gotta get up a little bit more.

923
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,790
Yeah?

924
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,040
Come on.

925
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,520
Come on.

926
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,620
You said you won't sue.

927
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,920
Come on, just look up.

928
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,000
When you look up, I can leave.

929
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,420
Legally, I have to make sure you're able to stand on your own before I can leave.

930
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:33,860
Woah.

931
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,320
I told you it's not flat.

932
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,720
Look, do you see that little bump right here?

933
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,280
Not little, sorry.

934
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,020
Do you see that above average bump right there?

935
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,960
I told you.

936
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,540
I told you I'm...

937
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,200
I told you there was something.

938
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,320
I...

939
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,600
Wait.

940
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,660
It's right there!

941
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,640
I told you it.

942
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,100
Don't you see?

943
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,940
It's right there.

944
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,340
It's right there.

945
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,400
Alright, okay.

946
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,200
Alright.

947
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,040
What?

948
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,980
The above average bump right there.

949
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,780
Anyway.

950
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,840
Oh, by the way.

951
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,360
Watch this.

952
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,000
When... You know how, like...

953
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,800
Um... you know how... you know, like when you warm up a cup and it...

954
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,660
There's those, like, those thermal cups.

955
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,020
So my shirt is actually a thermal shirt.

956
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,680
So, like, if it gets, like, uh, if it gets, like, too hot, like, right now.

957
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,160
God, it's so hot right now.

958
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,300
Oh, my God, because I'm here.

959
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,680
Anyway, so, like, you know how, okay, and then, like, it's so fucking hot, right?

960
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,020
And then, so...

961
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,140
Whoa!

962
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,100
You know, when it's so hot, my shirt is actually a thermal shirt.

963
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:57,540
So, it can actually, like, uh, turn, turn black when it gets way too hot.

964
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,480
Which is not the best, because it absorbs more sun.

965
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,100
But it's pretty cool, though.

966
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,220
It's, yeah, we're dark.

967
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,600
It's pretty cool.

968
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,600
But the only downside is that it does, like, absorb more of the sun.

969
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,640
So, it's even hotter.

970
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,180
So, like, it's a little difficult to turn it back.

971
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,940
But that's okay.

972
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,200
When I'm in the water, it turns back into...

973
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,220
It turns back to white.

974
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,940
See, like, if I just do this...

975
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,560
Look, like, a little bit of water touched me.

976
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,320
And now it's...

977
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,520
Now it's white again.

978
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,800
Ha ha ha!

979
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,540
The Lord is falling apart.

980
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,080
Ha ha ha!

981
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,360
It's a...

982
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,520
It's a thermal shirt.

983
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,620
Look, I know it's, like, really dumb that it turns black when it's hotter.

984
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,700
Because now it's gonna be even hotter.

985
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,540
But, like, I didn't think about that when I...

986
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,140
When I invented this shirt.

987
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,900
Okay, guys?

988
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,020
Like, that's...

989
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,500
Ha ha ha!

990
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,300
I didn't...

991
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,920
I didn't think about that.

992
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,280
But now it's done.

993
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:55,980
It's done.

994
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,700
It's the...

995
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,860
It's the doki way.

996
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,080
Okay, all right.

997
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,440
Okay, now you ready?

998
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,560
Oh, hey.

999
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,580
You're all...

1000
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,020
You're halfway there.

1001
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,100
Actually, no, you're 80% there.

1002
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,320
No, 90% there.

1003
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,120
I don't know my math.

1004
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,060
I...

1005
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,820
Ha ha ha!

1006
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,040
Just reverse the...

1007
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,420
No!

1008
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,460
I am committed to this science!

1009
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,300
Okay?

1010
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,240
I'm committed to it.

1011
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,020
All right.

1012
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,500
All right.

1013
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,820
In three...

1014
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,680
Two...

1015
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,560
One!

1016
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,740
You did it!

1017
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,520
Ha ha ha!

1018
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh, wait.

1019
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,940
I just realized I forgot something.

1020
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,100
Where is it?

1021
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,380
Yeah!

1022
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,180
Ha ha ha!

1023
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,820
Hello, dragoon!

1024
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,500
So you can't...

1025
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,380
Legally...

1026
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,580
You can't sue me anymore because you're standing on your two legs right now.

1027
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,860
And you seem fine.

1028
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,260
So, like, I'm pretty sure you're okay now.

1029
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,500
Ha ha ha!

1030
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,260
Yeah!

1031
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,540
You like my new look, dragoon?

1032
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,500
Oh, you want to see more of the hair?

1033
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,580
Of course.

1034
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,600
Of course, as long as you don't sue.

1035
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,000
Ha ha ha!

1036
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,880
Oh, you like the...

1037
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,240
Whoa!

1038
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,800
This has physics, too.

1039
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,260
Ha ha ha!

1040
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,800
Ha ha ha!

1041
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,680
Yeah, it's like airplane mode.

1042
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,460
Ha ha ha!

1043
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,100
Ha ha ha!

1044
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,660
And look, I have my...

1045
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,080
Um...

1046
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,980
My clip-ons because I don't have actual ear piercings because, um, I'm afraid of the pain.

1047
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:27,940
Uh...

1048
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,540
I'm really afraid of the pain getting my ears actually pierced.

1049
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,600
So this is just clip-ons.

1050
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,580
Like a clip-on tie, but for your ears.

1051
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,000
And I got it at Claire's.

1052
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,760
You guys like it?

1053
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,160
For only $4.99 for the whole set.

1054
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,500
Ha ha ha!

1055
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,540
Ha ha ha!

1056
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,540
Ha ha ha!

1057
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:46,860
Ha ha ha!

1058
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,180
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:47,520
Sorry.

1060
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,000
Oh, man.

1061
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,760
It's getting so hot, guys.

1062
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,140
Ha ha ha!

1063
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,240
Ha ha ha!

1064
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,400
Ha ha ha!

1065
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,460
Let me put my...

1066
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,040
Let me put...

1067
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,280
Oh!

1068
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,020
Oh, you notice something different?

1069
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,260
So...

1070
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,080
So my Hawaiian shirt...

1071
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,320
Is actually...

1072
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,180
Uh...

1073
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,360
My Hawaiian shirt...

1074
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,420
Is actually also a mood Hawaiian shirt.

1075
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,660
I don't know what the colors mean yet.

1076
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,760
So I can do...

1077
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,860
So like, you know, this is on default.

1078
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,140
And then...

1079
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
This is...

1080
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,860
This is on default.

1081
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,780
And then it can like...

1082
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,900
I don't know what I'm feeling when it turns light blue.

1083
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:28,980
Um...

1084
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,940
And then like...

1085
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,360
And then sometimes it can also turn...

1086
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,740
It can also turn white.

1087
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,200
So like, I...

1088
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,860
I have yet to figure out what mood go...

1089
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,680
Goes for what.

1090
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,400
But... It's like... It's like a chameleon scene.

1091
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,940
My RGB Hawaiian shirt.

1092
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,120
Yeah, that's right.

1093
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,740
But, I don't know.

1094
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,860
I don't know which one I like the most.

1095
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,360
I don't know what is considered default.

1096
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,240
Not gonna lie.

1097
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,640
Because I do like this color palette.

1098
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,440
And also this one, too.

1099
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,780
So, with the white shirt.

1100
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:13,120
So, I don't know which one I like the most for the Hawaiian shirt color scheme-wise.

1101
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,680
But, they're both cute.

1102
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,480
I find them both really, really cute.

1103
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,740
I don't know if I like the teal more or the light blue more.

1104
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,500
And you can get it from Doki Bird by Doki Bird.

1105
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,860
Or I could... Or I could take it off.

1106
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,880
Oh, yes!

1107
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,920
I almost forgot.

1108
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,540
JK, I didn't forget.

1109
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,170
He's so cool.

1110
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,010
Look at him.

1111
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,230
He's so...

1112
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,590
He's also on vacation.

1113
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,770
He's also getting his own beach episode, as well.

1114
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:51,790
Look at him.

1115
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,510
That's right.

1116
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,310
Right, Dad?

1117
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,050
Yeah!

1118
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,450
He also has his own Hawaiian shirt, too.

1119
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,090
You see it?

1120
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,230
You see his Hawaiian shirt, guys?

1121
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:01,070
Oh!

1122
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,590
I don't know why we got up.

1123
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,870
Oh my god, he did a little jump.

1124
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,090
But he has his own little Hawaiian shirt, as well.

1125
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,790
Look at him.

1126
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,970
He's so fly.

1127
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,570
Alright, Dad.

1128
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,150
Get out.

1129
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,630
Get out of here.

1130
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,250
But that's not all.

1131
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:25,710
Because...

1132
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,510
I can also do this.

1133
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:32,730
Yeah!

1134
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,690
Yo Kitty also is getting her very own beach episode.

1135
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,390
But that's not all!

1136
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,490
Yo Kitty with glasses!

1137
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,290
That's right!

1138
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,870
Even when I'm on the beach, I'm still doing business.

1139
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,090
I am Business Cat!

1140
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:51,990
Oh, yes.

1141
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,030
And I also have four ears.

1142
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,170
So I can hear you better.

1143
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,830
So I know when you're fucking camping.

1144
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,670
Alright, let me get this out of the way.

1145
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,030
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

1146
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,610
But yeah, I think the hair is really pretty, though.

1147
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,630
I love the hair.

1148
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,030
Professor Doe Kitty.

1149
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,370
But I think the hair is really, really pretty and cute.

1150
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,210
I think my mama did a really good job.

1151
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,190
Um, on the hair design.

1152
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:25,370
And also, like, uh, my papa's, Leah, uh, making all of me move like this.

1153
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,630
Yeah, the hair physics going wild right now.

1154
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:34,370
Uh, for those who don't know, actually, uh, this is actually, um, uh, Charity.

1155
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,270
The, the one who designed this and get the concept of this.

1156
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,450
The original design and the original concept, um, was the charity auction winner.

1157
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:50,390
So this very first outfit that I revealed was actually, um, conceptualized by one of your dragoons.

1158
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,130
Yes, your dragoon.

1159
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:57,650
Uh, one of your, one of yours, uh, picked the Doki Beach episode theme.

1160
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,490
The summer theme and helped with conceptualizing the design and where it was going to go.

1161
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:03,430
So, yeah.

1162
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,390
She helped with majority of the whole process.

1163
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:11,850
So this was the, this was an outfit that she designed and picked, uh, for all of you guys.

1164
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:12,610
Yes.

1165
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,290
The first outfit.

1166
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:15,170
Whoa.

1167
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,510
Yeah.

1168
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,250
Oh, yeah.

1169
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,150
But let me show you.

1170
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,230
Oh, yeah.

1171
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,070
Almost forgot.

1172
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,470
Sorry, I was so happy with the, I was so happy with the hair.

1173
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:30,990
And I forgot to show you guys the other stuff.

1174
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:36,450
So, I can obviously, I can, um, let me put my shirt back on.

1175
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:37,350
My mood.

1176
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,910
So I can take this off.

1177
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,870
So, so it won't distract you.

1178
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,730
You know, the, the, the jiggle physics won't distract you or anything.

1179
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,470
But I can take it off, guys.

1180
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,030
I can take it off.

1181
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:55,930
And I also, you know, when I'm playing my FPS games.

1182
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,250
I can show my gun.

1183
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,650
Um, my water gun.

1184
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,090
My non-lethal bullets here when I'm playing FPS games.

1185
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:10,610
And then I can also bring my beach ball up.

1186
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,530
The one that didn't give you a concussion.

1187
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,990
And then you can see my tail better, too.

1188
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:16,550
You know?

1189
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:19,670
Uh, when I get my tail feathers back during the summer.

1190
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,430
You can see that a little better.

1191
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,690
Right here.

1192
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:23,510
Uh.

1193
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:31,530
Um, and then we also have...

1194
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:31,890
Oh!

1195
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:40,170
I can also go back to, um, my original hairstyle as well.

1196
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,150
So, if I do this and then do that.

1197
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,570
My original hairstyle.

1198
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,650
I realize my neck gets a little bit longer with that.

1199
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,090
Because, uh...

1200
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,570
I realize my neck does get a little longer.

1201
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,110
But I feel like it should be even longer, you know?

1202
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,930
So, um...

1203
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,450
If you're gonna stare at my neck, at least stare at my entire neck.

1204
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:02,810
You know?

1205
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,490
So, at least now you know where my ponytail ends.

1206
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,930
It's a giraffe warrior now.

1207
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:21,610
Whoa!

1208
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,650
My giraffe neck.

1209
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:28,110
Also, also so you can see how my ponytail ends, too.

1210
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,850
It's for all your artists out there.

1211
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,310
Not the long neck part.

1212
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:36,310
But, like, so, like, all you artists out there know how the ponytail ends.

1213
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:36,890
Um.

1214
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,610
This is beautiful.

1215
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:39,790
Thank you.

1216
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,310
Thank you.

1217
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,290
I was born like this.

1218
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:41,990
Um.

1219
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,070
What else?

1220
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:43,570
What else?

1221
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,990
What else?

1222
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:44,430
Oh, yeah.

1223
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:44,910
Uh.

1224
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,290
I'm trying to make sure I showed everything.

1225
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:49,610
Oh, yeah.

1226
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,830
There's the snorkel again.

1227
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:51,870
Um.

1228
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:52,370
Hmm.

1229
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,570
But everything from before.

1230
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,430
From my bounty hunter skin suit.

1231
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,890
Comes along onto my, uh, my summer skin suit.

1232
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,490
So, so, you know.

1233
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,550
You know.

1234
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,570
This was requested by, by her, too.

1235
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:13,750
This was, this was actually requested by, by the charity auction winner.

1236
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,550
It was just finished early.

1237
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:15,870
So.

1238
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:23,310
This, this particular expression was actually requested by her.

1239
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,530
Including this part, too.

1240
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,690
And also, you know.

1241
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,810
This is back.

1242
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:36,610
As well.

1243
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:37,830
And then.

1244
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:38,430
Whoa.

1245
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,130
As well as the sparkle.

1246
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,330
The tears.

1247
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,370
The panic.

1248
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,730
My long neck.

1249
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:48,730
As you guys all saw.

1250
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:50,970
Um.

1251
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,370
Dead eyes.

1252
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,490
And then.

1253
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:54,830
Oh.

1254
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:55,350
Whoa.

1255
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,170
That's not what I wanted.

1256
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:56,850
Oh.

1257
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:57,290
Hello.

1258
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:58,290
Hello.

1259
00:52:58,830 --> 00:52:59,410
Hello.

1260
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,070
Anyway.

1261
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,350
That's enough talk.

1262
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,370
I think, dragons.

1263
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,310
I think you gotta get some water for your concussion.

1264
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,030
For your.

1265
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,050
I mean, for your not concussion.

1266
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:10,770
Um.

1267
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:11,710
You gotta get some rest.

1268
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,710
How about I'll take you to the chair over there.

1269
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:14,610
Real quick.

1270
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:14,990
Okay.

1271
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,750
I'll take you to the chair over there.

1272
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:17,850
So you can, uh.

1273
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:19,290
Um.

1274
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,970
You can, like, relax and stuff.

1275
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:21,310
Anyway.

1276
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:21,990
Give me a sec.

1277
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,390
Give me a sec.

1278
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:23,670
Let me.

1279
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:24,290
All right.

1280
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:24,650
Come on.

1281
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,070
Come on.

1282
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,610
Come on.

1283
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:26,590
Go to that chair.

1284
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,770
You know you want to.

1285
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:28,890
Whoa.

1286
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:29,330
Oh.

1287
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:29,690
Oh.

1288
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:29,770
Oh.

1289
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:30,390
You're passing out.

1290
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:30,670
Whoa.

1291
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,410
Here we are.

1292
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,090
Ha ha ha ha.

1293
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:33,770
Ha ha ha.

1294
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:36,310
Ha ha.

1295
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:36,650
Ha ha.

1296
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,930
Oh, you guys like this?

1297
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:39,890
Um.

1298
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:41,350
So.

1299
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:42,650
Um.

1300
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,210
It might.

1301
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,210
It's not moving.

1302
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,170
Because it wasn't done in time.

1303
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:46,830
Ha ha ha.

1304
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,270
But all of this will move soon.

1305
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,890
Don't worry.

1306
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:50,650
This.

1307
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,070
This will be moving.

1308
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,570
Soon in the future.

1309
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,210
Ha ha ha.

1310
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,350
Ha ha ha.

1311
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:57,450
Ha ha ha.

1312
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:58,810
Um.

1313
00:53:59,170 --> 00:53:59,650
But yeah.

1314
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,330
Um.

1315
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,250
We have tomato.

1316
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:03,070
Me.

1317
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,670
We're in the Doki-verse right now.

1318
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:09,170
So like you might spot different variations of me around here.

1319
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:09,730
Um.

1320
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:13,370
This is where all the Doki's like to relax during the summer.

1321
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:13,850
So.

1322
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:18,330
We all choose like one of the Doki's universes.

1323
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:19,990
And just like.

1324
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,350
Like relax your.

1325
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,630
Like the Doki with the best beach basically.

1326
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:24,090
You know.

1327
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,230
Because we can all travel to each other's universes.

1328
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,010
So.

1329
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:27,790
Um.

1330
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,370
We decided I'll convene.

1331
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,490
We always convene here.

1332
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,210
Uh.

1333
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,750
Because this Doki has a really really good beach.

1334
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:34,350
Uh.

1335
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:35,830
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1336
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:41,330
So you can see our tomato Doki here.

1337
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,050
Is our resident lifeguard.

1338
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,830
And she's doing a great job.

1339
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:47,190
I'm pretty sure she has at least only.

1340
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:48,090
Okay.

1341
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,270
Maybe like not only.

1342
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,150
But at least like five casualties.

1343
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,090
Since she's been our lifeguard.

1344
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,810
So I think that's a pretty good record.

1345
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:55,410
You know.

1346
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,430
At least from what we know.

1347
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,850
From confirmations.

1348
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,570
When we found the bodies.

1349
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,250
From all the bodies we found.

1350
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,350
At least five casualties.

1351
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,650
But that's a good record.

1352
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,510
I feel like.

1353
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,350
Ha ha ha ha.

1354
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:10,970
I think.

1355
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,170
I think that's a really good record.

1356
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:13,970
Anyway.

1357
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,790
Um.

1358
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,970
We have like our cool guy Dragoon back there.

1359
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:18,990
Because he's like.

1360
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:19,390

1361
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:19,790
Look.

1362
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,190
I'm on camera right now.

1363
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:22,710
Ha ha ha.

1364
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,790
Ha ha ha.

1365
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,950

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:31,390
Um.

1371
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:32,350
And then.

1372
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,610
We're sort of interrupting.

1373
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,330
I know there's a date.

1374
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,570

We don't want to interrupt this date.

00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:39,770
That's going on.

1379
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,090
Look.

00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:40,510

So.

1386
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,050

Ha ha ha.

00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,390
I think it's really really.

00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,590
I think it's really cute.

00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:11,330
I love.

1412
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,450
I love the background.

1413
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,150
That was made.

1414
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,630
Especially for this.

1415
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,290
For this particular outfit reveal.

1416
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,130
For this outfit too.

1417
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,450
Anyway.

1418
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:24,090
Since.

1419
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,470
Since you guys saw everything.

1420
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:27,550
Obviously.

1421
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,950
I'm here to give you guys the credit page.

1422
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:31,690
Let's see.

1423
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:32,610
Where's the credit page?

1424
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:33,830
I made this.

1425
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,730
This is the first outfit reveal.

1426
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,450
Where I was like.

1427
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:37,930
Six hours ready.

1428
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:38,770
Before the stream.

1429
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:40,430
And.

1430
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:40,890
Usually.

1431
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:42,330
That never happens to me.

1432
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,930
Ha ha.

1433
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:43,310
Usually.

1434
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:43,890
I'm like.

1435
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,210
Prepping everything.

1436
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,210
On.

1437
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,450
On OBS.

1438
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:48,350
Like.

1439
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,170
I'm usually like.

1440
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,490
Prepping stuff on OBS.

1441
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,030
Like.

1442
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:51,830
Uh.

1443
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,230
Two hours before the stream time.

1444
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,170
Um.

1445
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,450
But this is the first time.

1446
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,750
Out of all my years streaming.

1447
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,410
Where I had everything ready.

1448
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:00,190
Within.

1449
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,150
Uh.

1450
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:02,510
With like.

1451
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,090
At least six hours before stream.

1452
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,770
And it's like.

1453
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,530
I don't know if I like that.

1454
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,090
Because I was so nervous.

1455
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:08,990
And anxious.

1456
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,610
Leading up to this reveal.

1457
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:11,210
I.

1458
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:11,890
Ha ha.

1459
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,450
Ha ha.

1460
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:13,890
I.

1461
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:14,790
I was.

1462
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,910
So.

1463
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,750
So fucking anxious.

1464
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:19,950
And nervous throughout it.

1465
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:20,490
Um.

1466
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:21,650
Because I'm just waiting.

1467
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:22,710
And before then.

1468
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:23,690
When I'm like.

1469
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,250
You know.

1470
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:25,290
When I'm prepping stuff.

1471
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:25,910
Like.

1472
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,650
All I'm thinking about.

1473
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,290
Is trying to make sure.

1474
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,650
I get everything done in time.

1475
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:29,810
Before the reveal itself.

1476
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:30,570
And.

1477
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:31,230
So like.

1478
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,530
I'm not thinking about that.

1479
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:33,330
But this time.

1480
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:33,830
I had to.

1481
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:33,990
Like.

1482
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:34,570
I had to like.

1483
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,090
Sit there.

1484
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:35,770
And just think.

1485
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:36,410
And be like.

1486
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,170
I hope you guys.

1487
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:37,470
I hope.

1488
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:37,750
I'll be like.

1489
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:38,330
Oh my god.

1490
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,250
I hope they like this.

1491
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:39,810

Ha ha.

1495
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:46,930
Anyway.

1496
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:47,810
So.

1497
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,010
Um.

1498
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:49,890
You guys might notice.

1499
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:50,750
Um.

1500
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:52,590
I'll put it here.

1501
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,730
So you guys can see my face.

1502
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:54,470
Um.

1503
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:55,890
You guys might notice.

1504
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:56,390
That.

1505
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:57,150
I've been doing.

1506
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,150
There's always like.

1507
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,130
A little story.

1508
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,770
That goes into every.

1509
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:01,690
Outfit reveal.

1510
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,110
So it's not just like.

1511
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:03,970
Even though like.

1512
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:04,850
The story sort of like.

1513
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:05,850
Falls apart at the end.

1514
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:06,730
Ha ha ha.

1515
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:07,230
Cause.

1516
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,010
Ha ha.

1517
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,870
Ha ha.

1518
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,170
I'm really bad at making sure.

1519
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,670
You guys are still immersed.

1520
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:12,770
Ha ha ha.

1521
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:14,170
Ha ha ha.

1522
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:14,410
Ha ha ha.

I'm.

1526
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:16,990
I'm pretty bad at.

1527
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,490
Continuing the immersion.

1528
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,070
In general.

1529
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:19,970
Um.

1530
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:20,210

1532
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,030

00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,830
Give a little story.

1534
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,370
Before each like.

1535
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,270
Important.

1536
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:26,910
Like.

1537
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,090
Before each reveal.

1538
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,690
In general.

1539
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,810
And.

1540
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:31,970

1542
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,650
So.

1543
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,390
You guys can see.

1544
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:34,630
Like.

1545
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:34,910
You know.

1546
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,890
It was a little special.

1547
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:36,710
Um.

1548
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:37,810
Beach episode.

1549
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:38,590

1554
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,690

Um.

1558
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,410

Um.

1567
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,970
For the 3D animation.

1568
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:53,730
Tani.

1569
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:54,970
For 3D rigging.

1570
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:55,370
Everything.

1571
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,010

Sorry.

1574
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:57,330
3D rigging.

1575
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,230
The dragoons.

1576
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:58,870
For it.

1577
00:58:59,090 --> 00:58:59,570
And.

1578
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:00,530
The sound design.

1579
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:01,730
For Mr. Fox.

1580
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:02,650
Um.

1581
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:03,870
They actually.

1582
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:04,970
Um.

1583
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:05,630
Um.

1584
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:06,610
Uh.

1585
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,170
Mr. Fox.

1586
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,450
Did all the sound design.

1587
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,330
For that video.

1588
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,210
And.

1589
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:10,750
A huge shout.

1590
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,290
Um.

1591
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,270
The sound design.

1592
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,770
Was done.

1593
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:13,530
Within like.

1594
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,410
A day and a half.

1595
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:15,110
Um.

1596
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:15,410
So.

1597
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,570
I got the video.

1598
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:16,910
Like.

1599
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:17,770
Last night.

1600
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:18,750
And.

1601
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:19,170
Um.

1602
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,510
And the animators.

1603
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:21,950
It actually took the animators.

1604
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,070
A week.

1605
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:24,390
I think.

1606
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,150
A week.

1607
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:25,450
And.

1608
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:25,630
Like.

1609
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,410
Just a little.

1610
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:27,890
Bit of a week.

1611
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:28,870
Um.

1612
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,350
I think like.

1613
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,210
Eight to nine days.

1614
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:31,830
To make the entire animation.

1615
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:32,730
So.

1616
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:33,090
Like.

1617
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,050
Huge shout out.

1618
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:34,850
To that team.

1619
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,610
I asked them if they could do it.

1620
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:36,930
Because.

1621
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:37,810
Um.

1622
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,130
I had a different idea.

1623
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,330
On how to.

1624
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,790
Introduce everything.

1625
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:43,910
But.

1626
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:52,690
I got struck with inspiration on the storyboard, on the concept of the story, of how to introduce this.

1627
00:59:52,950 --> 01:00:00,870
So I contacted the 3D animators and was like, Oh, do you think this is possible?

1628
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,750
It's okay if it's not, and we can make it super short or anything.

1629
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:05,950
And they're like, no, we can do it.

1630
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,530
It's like plenty of time.

1631
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:12,710
Enough time to conceptualize everything and get it all done.

1632
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:15,990
Get it all done in time.

1633
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:20,730
So huge shout out to the 3D animation team for working really hard on all of this.

1634
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,910
And making this really cute story to segue into the outfit reveal.

1635
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:33,050
I think you guys might notice that I always like to make outfit reveals really special in general.

1636
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:37,130
Like I always like to have a little story that goes behind the outfit reveal.

1637
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:44,270
And it's not just like, you know, do like outfit prediction and then straight into like, you know, the padding.

1638
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,810
I always like to make it like, you know, immerseful.

1639
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,230
Like make it more immersive.

1640
01:00:52,230 --> 01:01:00,490
So there's like a little, there's like a little, you know, there's like a little story of why there's a beach episode.

1641
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,230
And like how you got here and everything.

1642
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:06,590
So, um, I always love doing these little creative things.

1643
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,890
Just like when I get, get a chance to do creative things, sit with it and play around.

1644
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,070
Um, huge shout out to Nami for the background.

1645
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,690
Um, for drawing the entire background of this.

1646
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:23,770
So there's the same artists that did, um, that did this, uh, the saloon.

1647
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,970
I almost said salon.

1648
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:33,610
But they're the same artists that did the, um, the saloon, uh, the bounty hunter background.

1649
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,850
So, and this is also going to be animated in the future.

1650
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:41,030
It's going to be animated by the same person who did the animation for the saloon.

1651
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:45,110
Um, but obviously, uh, they need more time on it.

1652
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,370
So, but it already looks amazing, in general.

1653
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,450
Even though it's not animated, it already looks amazing.

1654
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,630
And good job on my tomato lifeguard.

1655
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:58,130
I'm so happy that she's doing a great job at making sure no dragoons getting hurt right now.

1656
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:14,250
Also, I'll be showing you guys the sketches and concept art that I received from Nexi, who was the auction winner, and also from my mama.

1657
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,410
So, I'll be showing that later.

1658
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:19,490
And I do have, like, some sneak peek stuff to show you guys.

1659
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:25,950
So, if you guys want to see what the sneak peeks are, you got to stay a little longer.

1660
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:31,750
They're, like, sort of like announcements, but they're, like, preview announcements.

1661
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:34,150
That's all I can really say until I actually show it.

1662
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,210
There is also, like, a gift, too, that I want to give you guys.

1663
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,710
You might notice what the gift is already, from looking at the credits.

1664
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:45,870
Um, anyway.

1665
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,630
So, the debut teaser is by RetroVist.

1666
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:53,930
And I've always worked with RetroVist for all my debut teasers from, you know, like, my past and now.

1667
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,330
Like, they've been doing all my debut teasers.

1668
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,450
I love working with them.

1669
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,850
They do such a great job.

1670
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,370
You guys already know who my mama and papa is.

1671
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:06,150
Like, Celia and, um, Kamame.

1672
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,250
Okay.

1673
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:13,130
Um, and also, uh, now, you'll notice at the bottom, it says, wallpaper.

1674
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,270
Yes!

1675
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:26,430
Uh, with every outfit reveal, um, I do, I love giving you guys a free wallpaper to go along with, uh, with the outfit reveal.

1676
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,430
So, let me show you guys what the free wallpaper looks like!

1677
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,050
I'll post the link later.

1678
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,750
Oh, maybe I'll post the link, like, right after I show it to you guys.

1679
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:38,610
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1680
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:46,630
But yes, a shout out to, um, oh my gosh, wait, uh, to Hari... Haru?

1681
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:47,010
Haru?

1682
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:50,210
Sorry, I had to, like, I'll make sure I didn't mispronounce their name.

1683
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:57,010
But Haru, for drawing this wallpaper, this is a free wallpaper that everyone can download.

1684
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,590
Um, it's my gift to all of you guys.

1685
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:07,610
So let me post the link really quick right now because I had that prepared and everything because I am a professional.

1686
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:14,510
So you guys want to download the wallpaper right now?

1687
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,470
You can.

1688
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:21,050
And you can receive your free wallpaper because I know we all love free stuff.

1689
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:21,770
Yippee!

1690
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:30,370
So yes, huge shoutout to Haru for drawing this wallpaper.

1691
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,530
They did it really, really fast too.

1692
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:41,910
I don't know if you guys noticed, but a month ago I was asking for artists who can complete some stuff for me within a very tight timeframe.

1693
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:48,470
Which was like, you know, I think like she had like two to three weeks to do it.

1694
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:52,570
And then she was one of the artists that submitted her portfolio.

1695
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:57,350
And yeah, completed the illustration for all of you guys.

1696
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,010
I am planning on getting it animated in the future.

1697
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:04,810
So I can put it on Wallpaper Engine for you guys, for those who want to use like animated wallpapers.

1698
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:07,490
I am planning on getting that animated as well.

1699
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:08,750
There was just no time...

1700
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:13,090
There was just no time to get that done before the outfit revealed.

1701
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,550
The reason why...

1702
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:24,310
I know like you guys must be wondering like, Oh Doki, you said like, you didn't have time to get some stuff done in time.

1703
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:26,090
So why didn't you push it a little later?

1704
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:38,670
Because like, I promised the charity winner that I will have it done either before Off Kai or beginning of Off Kai.

1705
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:39,410
So...

1706
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:42,950
And I was okay with it.

1707
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:48,210
It was just like little things, you know, like the animated wallpaper and stuff like that.

1708
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:48,970
The animated background.

1709
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:49,890
It's just little things.

1710
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,690
And I was like, you know, I didn't get everything.

1711
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,490
Like, you know, I thought like, it doesn't really matter.

1712
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:56,570
Like, you know, those two things, just small stuff.

1713
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:00,690
It was close enough, you know, day one of Off Kai.

1714
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:05,590
Because I have everything else done.

1715
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:10,350
It was just like the animated backgrounds and the animated wallpaper.

1716
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:11,770
It's just little things.

1717
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,050
And I was okay with it.

1718
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:13,870
I was just like, you know what?

1719
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:16,030
I got almost everything here.

1720
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,230
So close enough, you know, close enough.

1721
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,890
Another thing I wanted...

1722
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:30,790
Okay, so I also really wanted to show you guys the concept art that I was sent from Nexi.

1723
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:34,650
How they wanted their...

1724
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,090
How they wanted the summer outfit to look like.

1725
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:39,730
So let me show.

1726
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,610
I apologize.

1727
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:43,050
I don't remember who the concept artist were.

1728
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:47,770
I believe she got two artists to help with conceptualizing everything.

1729
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,550
But I'll show you what I was sent.

1730
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,590
I didn't write it down when I saved these.

1731
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:57,290
So I believe Nexi can let me know in chat who they are.

1732
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:03,330
So this was what I was sent.

1733
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,430
So basically they wanted the Hawaiian shirt, the water balloons.

1734
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:12,630
At first they wanted like a dragon perched on my hand.

1735
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:16,610
But I changed that into a beach ball.

1736
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,850
Oh, it was orca and rice.

1737
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:19,370
Oh, okay.

1738
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:24,290
It was orca and rice that did the concept art.

1739
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:28,730
And then they wanted the dragon crocs and the tail feathers.

1740
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,590
They requested to have a tail.

1741
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:37,890
And then obviously, of course, because in my lore that I didn't just come up like an hour ago.

1742
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:43,550
In the summer, I grow tail feathers because it's time to dance.

1743
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,430
And it's warm now.

1744
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,350
And obviously, I did change some stuff as well.

1745
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:58,070
Because you can see that I made you guys into a beach ball instead.

1746
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,290
Because I was like, we're at a beach.

1747
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,690
You guys should be all beach ball.

1748
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:05,730
And then I was also sent this as well as another concept art.

1749
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:10,970
So, I really like the hairstyle that they gave us.

1750
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,170
That they gave me and my mama.

1751
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:14,770
Because look!

1752
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:16,150
It looks so cute.

1753
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,030
Wow!

1754
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:21,870
I can be like...

1755
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,770
Let me make myself a little closer.

1756
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:25,030
Give me a sec.

1757
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:26,970
Oh!

1758
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:29,050
Just a little closer though.

1759
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,110
I wanted you guys to see my stomach a little.

1760
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:31,430
There.

1761
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,130
There.

1762
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:37,150
Don't say I never give you nothing!

1763
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:42,790
Well...

1764
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,190
I mean, that's fine.

1765
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,330
I'll just...

1766
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,330
Let me change the color.

1767
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:47,850
There we go.

1768
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:48,870
Um...

1769
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:50,030
And also...

1770
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,070
Alright, so...

1771
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:51,890
With those...

1772
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:52,470
Concept art.

1773
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,310
Uh...

1774
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:55,230
This is what my...

1775
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,330
Uh...

1776
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,350
Which one was it?

1777
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,970
Was it this?

1778
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,810
I think this was it.

1779
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:02,170
This was what my mama sent.

1780
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:03,770
Um...

1781
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:04,310
Sent me.

1782
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:07,530
With the concept art that they gave.

1783
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:10,030
Um...

1784
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:12,570
So...

1785
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:13,590
Um...

1786
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,590
It was...

1787
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,130
I remembered...

1788
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:16,830
Um...

1789
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:17,850
It was very hard to...

1790
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,750
To...

1791
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,470
To figure out the color scheme.

1792
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,770
Because I liked...

1793
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,770
A lot of these colors...

1794
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:23,930
I liked all the color schemes.

1795
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:24,810
That's why...

1796
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:26,010
That's why...

1797
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:26,950
Um...

1798
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:29,150
My Hawaiian shirt comes in three different colors.

1799
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,730
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1800
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,010
Ha ha ha ha!

1801
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:34,850
So...

1802
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,670
I just couldn't pick.

1803
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,290
So I was like, I'll take them all.

1804
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:38,770
Like...

1805
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,010
I'll take all the color schemes.

1806
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:40,610
Cuz...

1807
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,350
They're all...

1808
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,810
They're all really nice color schemes.

1809
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:43,670
Um...

1810
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,030
Hence...

1811
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:48,390
Yeah, hence my mood ring shirt, that I still don't know what mood comes, goes with what.

1812
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:52,510
Uh, I guess I... I want them on.

1813
01:09:52,810 --> 01:10:02,650
Um, so you can see that not a lot was changed in the end from the concept art to, like, the design itself.

1814
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:07,070
And then I believe, um, they also edited this as well.

1815
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:13,190
Uh, so this was edited by Nexi's artist, um, to get...

1816
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,650
Wait, let me... let me...

1817
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:16,210
Um...

1818
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:16,890
Hello, everybody!

1819
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:21,490
Hello, everyone!

1820
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,690
So, um, you can see that...

1821
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:32,990
Um, this was the artist editing my mama's design to get what they wanted.

1822
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:35,470
Like, what their vision was and everything.

1823
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:36,950
And then in the end...

1824
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:41,010
Oh, and also, here's dad, too, for those who want to know what dad's design is.

1825
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,890
His Hawaii shirt is a hot dog.

1826
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:50,550
He has a... he has a hot dog Hawaiian shirt.

1827
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:54,350
Mine's a dragon Hawaiian shirt, and he's wearing a hot dog Hawaiian shirt.

1828
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,150
Um, at first, we wanted to do...

1829
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,550
We asked if my mama could do...

1830
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:01,890
I think they're called shutter shades.

1831
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,890
Um, because, like, I think they were, like, really popular back in the 2010s.

1832
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,010
I remember seeing those in 2010s.

1833
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:08,950
But...

1834
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:09,930
I asked.

1835
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,590
I think my mama doesn't know what shutter shades are.

1836
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:13,870
Um...

1837
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,610
And then I was just like, it's alright.

1838
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:16,750
We can just do sunglasses.

1839
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,810
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1840
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:19,370
Hahahaha.

1841
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:22,770
I don't remember why we didn't do shutter shades.

1842
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:23,350
I just think...

1843
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,870
I think, like, because they were not, like, super well-known.

1844
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:26,910
I guess, like, in Japan.

1845
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:27,850
Like they're not...

1846
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,330
They're not, like, well-known...

1847
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:32,790
It's not like a well-known sunglasses design in Japan.

1848
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:39,030
And I don't remember why we didn't end up with Shudder Shades, but he's wearing sunglasses now.

1849
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:45,130
Yeah, he has... he's party rocking right now.

1850
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,690
Party rocking's in the house tonight.

1851
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:51,110
Everybody's gonna have a good time.

1852
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,710
Also, by the way, don't worry.

1853
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,750
We're gonna have a green screen later, guys.

1854
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,810
Don't worry.

1855
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:01,290
We'll have a green screen later.

1856
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:05,110
But yeah, those were... I think that's basically all the concept art, really.

1857
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,930
And so, you can see here.

1858
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:15,010
After that, after the back and forth, this is, like, where we settled with the little water gun.

1859
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:18,290
So I could use that during my, you know, my Marble Rival streams.

1860
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,870
And the Crocs and everything.

1861
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,490
And the little hairband and the necklaces and the earrings.

1862
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:30,690
This is where we... this is where we settled in the end with all the conceptual art.

1863
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:31,950
And with Nexi.

1864
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,590
So, yeah.

1865
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,470
What else?

1866
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,770
What else?

1867
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:36,630
I wanna show you guys.

1868
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,810
But yeah, that's, like, how the concept art came to be.

1869
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:42,270
And from there, we got this.

1870
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,430
Okay, don't mind that.

1871
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,610
That's just the...

1872
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,510
Yeah, from there, we got this, too.

1873
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,590
But I love how everything came out in the end.

1874
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:57,390
What else?

1875
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:57,830
I wanna show you.

1876
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:59,110
Okay, so...

1877
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:00,430
You know how?

1878
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,990
Alright, I'll give you guys a sneak peek of something.

1879
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:06,510
Okay, so...

1880
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:08,610
You know how?

1881
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,530
Um...

1882
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:12,990
I was talking about Dad's Hawaiian shirt.

1883
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,170
Okay, well...

1884
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:17,710
Hee hee hee.

1885
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,750
In the...

1886
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,310
Soon.

1887
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:20,770
Not sure when.

1888
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:21,930
But soon.

1889
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:24,210
Soon.

1890
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,870
So...

1891
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:33,490
You know, I was talking about my clothing brand.

1892
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:35,070
Doki Bird by Doki Bird.

1893
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,130
So...

1894
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,770
This is for your pets, by the way.

1895
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:40,530
It's not...

1896
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:42,110
It's not for you!

1897
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,250
Drag rooms!

1898
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:44,550
It...

1899
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,590
It's gonna...

1900
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:46,530
Um...

1901
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:49,350
It's gonna be edited a little bit because there's too many hot dogs.

1902
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:50,370
But...

1903
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:51,170
This is a...

1904
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,250
Hawaiian shirt for your pet.

1905
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,130
It's there...

1906
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:59,730
And he can't stop me!

1907
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:00,730
So...

1908
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:04,470
It's gonna be edited a little bit because there's too many hot dogs.

1909
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:05,490
But...

1910
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,510
We got a sample.

1911
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,970
I was allowed to share this with you guys.

1912
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:11,570
I mean, to be fair, this is like my own store.

1913
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:12,350
But...

1914
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:14,050
So...

1915
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,130
It's gonna look...

1916
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:17,450
It's basically gonna look like...

1917
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,810
Okay, I'll show you guys what...

1918
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:19,770
How we're editing this.

1919
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:21,470
So we're gonna edit this...

1920
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:22,250
Later.

1921
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:22,750
We're gonna...

1922
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:26,130
I mean, we sent it to the manufacturer to edit it a little bit more.

1923
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:26,790
But...

1924
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:28,430
It's gonna look like this instead.

1925
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,990
Because we realized...

1926
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:31,530
That's too many hot dogs.

1927
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:32,350
So...

1928
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:33,510
Basically...

1929
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,970
Like...

1930
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,190
It's for like cats...

1931
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:36,130
And dogs.

1932
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:37,570
And I guess like...

1933
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,430
Other four-legged...

1934
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:39,490
Animal.

1935
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:46,350
But...

1936
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,610
There's gonna be like...

1937
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,610
Yeah, so this is what it's actually gonna look like.

1938
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,130
Where...

1939
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:51,970
It's not too many hot dogs.

1940
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:53,290
Um...

1941
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,150
Because this one was like...

1942
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:55,230
Way too many hot dogs.

1943
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,710
So we're gonna...

1944
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:57,650
We're gonna...

1945
01:14:57,650 --> 01:15:00,110
We're gonna have it like this...

1946
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:00,650
Instead.

1947
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:01,770
Um...

1948
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,770
If you guys are wondering...

1949
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:03,910
Why is there like...

1950
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:05,010
Gamersupps in the back...

1951
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:05,310
Um...

1952
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,390
They are my distributor.

1953
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:07,630
So they help me...

1954
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:08,270
Come up with the ideas.

1955
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,130
But...

1956
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:09,510
They...

1957
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,270
It's not gonna be on the Gamersupp website.

1958
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:12,850
It's gonna be on my website.

1959
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:13,290
Because...

1960
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:15,430
They're just helping me distribute...

1961
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:15,750
Uh...

1962
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:16,250
My merch.

1963
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,710
So you're gonna get them...

1964
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,190
A lot...

1965
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:18,570
Like...

1966
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:18,890
You know...

1967
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,790
We fixed all our merch issues.

1968
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:25,870
So...

1969
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:26,550
Um...

1970
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:27,630
They're helping me with...

1971
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:27,910
Distri...

1972
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:28,390
Uh...

1973
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,130
Distribution.

1974
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:29,950
Basically.

1975
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:30,810
And that's why there's like...

1976
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:32,090
Gamersupp logos in the back.

1977
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:32,550
But yeah!

1978
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:33,730
I was like...

1979
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,910
I want a Hawaiian...

1980
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:35,650
And then like...

1981
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:37,000
Every crazy idea...

1982
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:38,690
I have for merch...

1983
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:40,150
They basically...

1984
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:41,530
Um...

1985
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:42,690
They basically...

1986
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:44,010
Help me make it into a reality.

1987
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:45,230
Because...

1988
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:46,610
Do not worry...

1989
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:47,910
You can also...

1990
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,430
You'll also be able to get...

1991
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,250
My Hawaiian shirt too.

1992
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:54,110
But it's still a work in progress.

1993
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:56,910
I can't...

1994
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,750
I can't show it to you guys yet.

1995
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:00,130
Because...

1996
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,270
It's still a work in progress right now.

1997
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:03,270
But...

1998
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:06,250
My Hawaiian shirt will also be...

1999
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,890
Purchasable in the future.

2000
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,750
I just can't show you the sample yet.

2001
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,110
Because we're still working on the sample.

2002
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:11,890
And I'm...

2003
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:12,350
Um...

2004
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,930
And I'm like changing the color of it.

2005
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,870
To look a little nicer.

2006
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,830
So you can match with your pet too.

2007
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:20,370
So you can have...

2008
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:21,130
Um...

2009
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,850
A Hawaiian shirt with your pet.

2010
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,990
But also...

2011
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,710
That's not all.

2012
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,810
Because this is another thing...

2013
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,590
I want to show you guys.

2014
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,360
CrocGiplets!

2015
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,000
I told you...

2016
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,700
Any dumb idea I have...

2017
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,780
They can make it possible.

2018
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,680
And this was one of the ideas...

2019
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,400
That you really wanted to do.

2020
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,180
I was like...

2021
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,780
I have to get the CrocGibits too.

2022
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:46,900
If I...

2023
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:49,880
Yes.

2024
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,800
So basically...

2025
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,860
These little things...

2026
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:54,520
Are...

2027
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,880
The little charms...

2028
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,840
That you put on your Crocs.

2029
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,080
Like the holes and stuff.

2030
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,320
Now...

2031
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,160
So...

2032
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,160
You...

2033
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:07,660
You...

2034
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:07,800
Yeah.

2035
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:08,620
So you can...

2036
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:08,920
It's like...

2037
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:09,880
It comes in a whole pack.

2038
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,140
So it's not like individual.

2039
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,080
So you get...

2040
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,020
If you buy the whole...

2041
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:13,840
Like you just have...

2042
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,080
It comes in a whole pack and everything.

2043
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,480
So the pack comes with all of these designs.

2044
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,480
So...

2045
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,600
It's gonna...

2046
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,320
Ordering...

2047
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,220
The items will be up...

2048
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:22,620
Soon.

2049
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,580
During my...

2050
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:25,820
Joki merch...

2051
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:26,600
Relaunch.

2052
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:27,780
Um...

2053
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,600
Whenever that's done.

2054
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,120
But...

2055
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,920
I'm super excited because...

2056
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,580
Coming out with these like...

2057
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,700
Merch ideas...

2058
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,860
Has been something I've been wanting...

2059
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,720
To do for a very long time.

2060
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,820
And I'll have a lot of really...

2061
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,520
Funny...

2062
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:46,920
Not funny.

2063
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:47,140
Sorry.

2064
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,480
That's not the right word.

2065
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,600
I love weird ideas...

2066
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,140
That I've always wanted to do for merch.

2067
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,540
Because I don't want to do...

2068
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,380
You know...

2069
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:55,880
I'm someone that just doesn't want to do...

2070
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,820
Just only like...

2071
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:57,480
You know...

2072
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,100
Um...

2073
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,500
Um...

2074
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,200
Just acrylic stands...

2075
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,380
And you know...

2076
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:03,120
Uh...

2077
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:03,880
Buttons...

2078
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,340
And charms.

2079
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,640
I want to do more than that.

2080
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,500
So...

2081
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,040
I'm really thankful...

2082
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,560
For Gamer Subs...

2083
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,640
For letting me...

2084
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,260
Come up with all these...

2085
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,360
Merch ideas...

2086
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:13,940
For you guys.

2087
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,160
Um...

2088
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,460
Because like...

2089
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:16,860
Um...

2090
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,100
You know...

2091
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,860
I want you guys to have more variety in there.

2092
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:19,280
Like...

2093
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,860
Make it more usable too.

2094
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,240
And stuff like that.

2095
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:22,920
Yeah.

2096
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,020
So...

2097
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,880
I'm super excited...

2098
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,880
That I was actually able to like...

2099
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,780
Get that made.

2100
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,040
Like when I pitched this idea.

2101
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:32,820
Um...

2102
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:33,780
I'm happy that...

2103
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,400
This was one of the things that...

2104
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:35,660
You know...

2105
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,900
I could actually do and everything.

2106
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,940
I don't think I've had an idea rejected yet.

2107
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:39,520
So...

2108
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,900
There's a lot more...

2109
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,400
Funky stuff...

2110
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,280
That's gonna come out.

2111
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:44,640
And because...

2112
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,200
You know what?

2113
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,480
Because I'm feeling extra generous today.

2114
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,480
I saw people...

2115
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,240
In chat...

2116
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,080
Were asking about...

2117
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,340
A particular merch...

2118
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,080
In general.

2119
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,420
And I actually...

2120
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,640
Just got...

2121
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,240
The...

2122
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,740
First sample...

2123
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,060
Today.

2124
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,640
And...

2125
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,080
I know...

2126
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,680
People were asking about this.

2127
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,960
Because I showed this...

2128
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,720
Last year.

2129
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,640
The concept art for it.

2130
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:12,680
And...

2131
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,960
Um...

2132
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:14,640
Never again.

2133
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,040
Because...

2134
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,200
It's been in pre-production...

2135
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,020
For a while.

2136
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,800
So I've finally shown...

2137
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,200
A sample of it.

2138
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,660
And it is...

2139
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,220
Ta-da!

2140
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,440
Isn't she so cute?

2141
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,500
Oh my god!

2142
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,660
You guys remember her?

2143
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:36,760
Oh my god.

2144
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,160
This was like last year.

2145
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,560
And here's her with a hat.

2146
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:42,220
Um...

2147
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,720
It's still in sample mode.

2148
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:44,660
So...

2149
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,280
Well...

2150
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,080
We're gonna be...

2151
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,080
Editing this...

2152
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,040
Too...

2153
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:48,640
More.

2154
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,680
But I just wanted to show you guys...

2155
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,880
The progress of everything.

2156
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:52,880
Um...

2157
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,960
But I think I'm gonna make the hat...

2158
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,700
A little shorter.

2159
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,720
Uh...

2160
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:56,400
But yes...

2161
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,820
There's Retro Me...

2162
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,500
Um...

2163
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,420
It's been in development for a while...

2164
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,580
And I'm super happy with...

2165
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,260
How it's looking so far!

2166
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,680
Look how cute she is...

2167
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,040
With the eyes and everything!

2168
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,080
Oh my god!

2169
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,180
She's so cute!

2170
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:10,220
Uh...

2171
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,260
And it has a little hat and everything!

2172
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,320
But yeah...

2173
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,020
Those are all the little previews I wanted to show you guys.

2174
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:18,820
Um...

2175
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:19,660
I think honestly...

2176
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:23,480
My favorite thing out of all of it is like...

2177
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,260
This little...

2178
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:24,780
Is this...

2179
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,460
This is my favorite out of all of them.

2180
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,160
Ha ha ha ha!

2181
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,180
Ha ha ha ha!

2182
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:30,760
The little...

2183
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,060
The little crocs symbols...

2184
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,040
The little croc accessories...

2185
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,240
Is my favorite merch.

2186
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:36,820
Cause like...

2187
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:37,420
I don't know.

2188
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,020
You don't really see that a lot.

2189
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:39,700
You know...

2190
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,540
As like...

2191
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:41,800
VTuber merch...

2192
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,820
You don't really...

2193
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:44,140
See that in general.

2194
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,860
So I'm really excited about the...

2195
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,280
Um...

2196
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,140
About the Crocs VTuber...

2197
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:51,480
The Crocs VTuber merch.

2198
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,120
Uh...

2199
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,020
Blah blah blah blah...

2200
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:53,440
Okay.

2201
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:54,500
What else do I want to talk about?

2202
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:54,940
Oh!

2203
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,440
Yes!

2204
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:55,860
Okay.

2205
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,660
Okay, it's green screen time.

2206
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,980
Get your cameras ready.

2207
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,620
I'm ready to green screen myself.

2208
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:04,640
Well, not green screen.

2209
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,840
Maybe like... I think I made purple screen, I think.

2210
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,200
Because there's so many colors.

2211
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,800
There's so many colors.

2212
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,000
So I'm like, fuck, what color do I use?

2213
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:17,760
All right.

2214
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,620
Close your eyes.

2215
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,580
Now open them.

2216
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,280
All right.

2217
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:23,840
I think this works.

2218
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:24,760
No, wait.

2219
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:25,760
Yes, it worked.

2220
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,320
It should work.

2221
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:30,980
It should... It's photoshoot time.

2222
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,160
All right.

2223
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,800
Let me... Okay.

2224
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:34,880
All right.

2225
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:36,200
Let me do full body first.

2226
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,260
I don't know what should be the default.

2227
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:44,940
Because I like... I honestly... I like... I like this one with the white.

2228
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:50,460
But I also like... I also like it with the blue as well.

2229
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,140
So like... I can't tell.

2230
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,400
Do you guys like the blue?

2231
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:55,740
Or...

2232
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,200
Um... Blue or the... Or the... Oh, wait.

2233
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:01,560
Sorry.

2234
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:02,820
Blue or the teal?

2235
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:03,500
Or green?

2236
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,460
I guess that's green.

2237
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,360
Blue or green?

2238
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,000
I can't tell.

2239
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,100
They both look so good.

2240
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,780
Um... I like... You like the blue?

2241
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,060
The blue?

2242
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,380
Okay.

2243
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,040
We'll go with blue as first.

2244
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,260
Blue or green?

2245
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:14,700
Okay.

2246
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,620
I'm gonna make a pull.

2247
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,460
Because I don't know what would be the default.

2248
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:18,740
Because I like both of them.

2249
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,740
Um... I'll make a pull for now.

2250
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:23,700
And I'll decide... I'll decide the end of the stream.

2251
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,780
Blue... Blue... Hawaiian... Shirt... Or... Green.

2252
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:31,040
Did I spell Hawaiian right?

2253
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:31,920
Oh, thank God.

2254
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,180
Okay.

2255
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,440
Okay.

2256
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,680
I just forgot to capitalize H.

2257
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,000
You know how like... If you don't capitalize a state...

2258
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Or a country... Um... It tells you you spelled it wrong.

2259
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,520
And I was like...

2260
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:44,960
Oh my God.

2261
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,260
How did I spell Hawaiian wrong?

2262
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,280
Um... Alright.

2263
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,740
I'll put that in here.

2264
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,480
Alright.

2265
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,320
Anyway.

2266
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,280
So there's the full body.

2267
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,360
Here it is with...

2268
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,560
The green.

2269
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,860
And then... Here it is with...

2270
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,380
The white... And the black shirt.

2271
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,440
Because I think the white and black shirt is a really...

2272
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,380
Cute combo too.

2273
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,120
And then...

2274
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,760
And then here's...

2275
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,540
The physics... In general.

2276
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,020
Whoa!

2277
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:13,960
Oh my God.

2278
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:14,740
I forgot the snorkel.

2279
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,480
I forgot the snorkel.

2280
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,580
There's so many things.

2281
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,340
There... I have so many things.

2282
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,380
So many buttons.

2283
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,380
I got my stream deck out for this.

2284
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,020
I only get stream deck out whenever I'm doing an outfit reveal.

2285
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:27,760
I...

2286
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,280
You guys want the BGM?

2287
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:30,640
I mean...

2288
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,560
I could put a BGM on.

2289
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:34,260
Okay.

2290
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,500
I'll put a BGM on for you guys.

2291
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:36,580
So it's not just me.

2292
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:37,840
There's so many things.

2293
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:38,580
So I don't know what...

2294
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,540
To do with pictures of.

2295
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,000
I don't...

2296
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,340
I don't know.

2297
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,360
There's too many intagos.

2298
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,280
Too many accessories, guys.

2299
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,640
I don't know.

2300
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,920
There's so many choices.

2301
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,760
What do I put on?

2302
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,060
And then there's me with glasses.

2303
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,160
My snorkels and glasses.

2304
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:57,520
And then...

2305
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:57,920
Okay.

2306
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,640
We'll do...

2307
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,180
We'll do faces first.

2308
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,340
Faces is always a good idea.

2309
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:02,900
Okay.

2310
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,900
Faces with...

2311
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,620
I'm like overwhelmed already.

2312
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:10,580
I'm already...

2313
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:11,980
I'm already...

2314
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,120
So...

2315
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,320
Wait.

2316
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,420
There's purple on this shirt?

2317
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:14,780
Okay.

2318
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:15,300
Don't worry.

2319
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,540
Don't worry.

2320
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,420
I got you guys.

2321
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:17,920
Okay.

2322
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:18,820
Watch this.

2323
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,120
I made sure.

2324
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,220
Because I was like what...

2325
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:21,380
Okay.

2326
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:21,960
Watch this.

2327
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,200
Okay.

2328
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,080
What color, guys?

2329
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:28,300
Green?

2330
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:30,120
No.

2331
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,300
Because then my eyes.

2332
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:32,580
Okay.

2333
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,620
What about...

2334
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,560
This color?

2335
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:36,740
Yeah.

2336
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,940
We're RGB-ing to figure out what color to use.

2337
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,300
We can't use yellow!

2338
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,180
Okay.

2339
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,600
You think this works?

2340
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:49,300
Oh.

2341
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:49,940
There we go.

2342
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:50,580
There you go.

2343
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,020
Red.

2344
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:51,500
Yes.

2345
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:51,840
Okay.

2346
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,220
There we go.

2347
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,160
We figured it out.

2348
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:53,980
It's...

2349
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:54,220
Okay.

2350
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,240
I think...

2351
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,320
I think this is a good color.

2352
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,240
I'm every color.

2353
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:00,600
I know!

2354
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,420
That's what I'm saying!

2355
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,440
It's so difficult because I'm every color right now.

2356
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,200
All right.

2357
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:06,940
There we go.

2358
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,340
This should work, guys.

2359
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,060
As long as I don't...

2360
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:10,200
Okay.

2361
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:10,740
As...

2362
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,060
It wouldn't work because I have this.

2363
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,860
But like you guys don't see that right now.

2364
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So it works right now.

2365
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,100
Um...

2366
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,360
It works right now because I'm not showing this.

2367
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,720
I'm only showing...

2368
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,340
Um...

2369
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,060
My face.

2370
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,180
So you guys don't have to worry.

2371
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:26,620
Anyway.

2372
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,000
Yes, of course it's colorful.

2373
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,180
It's a Hawaiian shirt.

2374
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:29,880
All right.

2375
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,180
So...

2376
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:31,860
Um...

2377
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,500
Dad here.

2378
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,400
And him.

2379
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,420
He's so cool.

2380
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,540
His little feet's hanging out too.

2381
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:38,800
He's so cool.

2382
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,120
Wow.

2383
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,040
Wow.

2384
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,840
So am I supposed to...

2385
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,680
I'm just trying to remember if there's anything else after this.

2386
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,800
After the green screen.

2387
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,020
The red screen.

2388
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,700
I'm just trying to figure out...

2389
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,140
Do I have anything else to show you guys after this?

2390
01:25:59,140 --> 01:25:59,820
I don't know.

2391
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,120
There's Dad.

2392
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,000
And then...

2393
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,740
There he goes.

2394
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,020
Um...

2395
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,020
And then...

2396
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,300
Guys.

2397
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,200
You guys like my new outfit.

2398
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:14,900
Review.

2399
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,380
You guys like my first...

2400
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,540
My first outfit.

2401
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,980
Since I came out as a bounty hunter.

2402
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,360
You guys like it?

2403
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:27,920
Yeah?

2404
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,720
You guys like it?

2405
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:30,660
Yeah?

2406
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,380
Good.

2407
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,120
That's not gaslighting, guys.

2408
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,120
I am not trying to manipulate anybody.

2409
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:40,460
All right.

2410
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,500
And then there's...

2411
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,100
Confused.

2412
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:43,680
Like...

2413
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:43,900
Whoa.

2414
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,700
I'm so confused.

2415
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,840
And then...

2416
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,460
There's...

2417
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,820
Oh my god.

2418
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:54,880
New outfit.

2419
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,220
I like new things.

2420
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:57,040
Wow.

2421
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,880
Oh my god.

2422
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,720
Then we have...

2423
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:13,200
And then obviously the fan favorite.

2424
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,640
I would...

2425
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:19,680
I like to say that I was a trendsetter for the long neck VTubers.

2426
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:22,520
I was patient zero.

2427
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,840
Even before I came back.

2428
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,920
I was patient zero.

2429
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,540
Before it was cool.

2430
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:36,480
Okay.

2431
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,520
I need you guys...

2432
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,840
We cannot rewrite history here.

2433
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,700
Some of you guys were actually making fun of my long neck before then.

2434
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:43,100
Okay.

2435
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,120
And now...

2436
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:44,900
Now it's cool.

2437
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:45,720
I...

2438
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:49,700
I lived long enough to find out my long necks are cool now.

2439
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,700
I am a trendsetter.

2440
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,680
Okay.

2441
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,720
And then I have...

2442
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,780
Um...

2443
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,000
I have...

2444
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,060
The blank eyes.

2445
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,380
No comment.

2446
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,600
No comment.

2447
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,020
No comment on that.

2448
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:17,740
No.

2449
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,260
And then...

2450
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,700
There's me with glasses.

2451
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:21,660
Right here.

2452
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,380
Which glasses is me?

2453
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,140
Whoa.

2454
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:24,900
Whoa.

2455
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:25,940
Glasses me?

2456
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,040
Now people will think I know what a whole number is.

2457
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:30,840
And...

2458
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,860
And then we have...

2459
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2460
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2461
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,220
Okay.

2462
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:38,940
And then...

2463
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,880
And then we also have...

2464
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,780
The dark circles.

2465
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,500
Which is sort of like me every day for the...

2466
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,300
For the last couple of weeks.

2467
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,440
I have a concert in like...

2468
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,020
I literally have a...

2469
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,300
Concert in two weeks now...

2470
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:52,720
From now.

2471
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,120
And I...

2472
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,200
And then I was...

2473
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,020
Working on this.

2474
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:56,860
And the concert.

2475
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:59,140
And a lot of other stuff behind the scenes.

2476
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,220
And then my birthday.

2477
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,420
And all my...

2478
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:03,820
This is how I've been feeling the last couple of weeks.

2479
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2480
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,680
And then we also have...

2481
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,380
This one.

2482
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:08,980
And then if you want...

2483
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,760
There's a combo...

2484
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:11,840
Of it too.

2485
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,120
This was like...

2486
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:13,810
Requested by...

2487
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:15,820
Um...

2488
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:18,780
This one was especially requested by...

2489
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,940
Uh...

2490
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:20,240
Uh...

2491
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:20,540
Nexi.

2492
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:21,620
The auction winner.

2493
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,140
And then we have...

2494
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:24,820
Cat ears!

2495
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:25,500
Yeah!

2496
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:29,540
Hmm.

2497
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:34,960
Hmm.

2498
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2499
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:37,320
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2500
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,640
Here is...

2501
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,280
The cat ears.

2502
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:42,960
Oh my god.

2503
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:43,940
What the Nexi say?

2504
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:46,860
Okay.

2505
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:48,460
Okay.

2506
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,500
Alright, and then... Oh wait, I have cat ears with the telltale.

2507
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:07,940
Alright, and then we have... Oh yeah, so like I said, I'm gonna change the colors of my shirt.

2508
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:11,080
And put the snorkel up.

2509
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:15,920
Oh wait, I can take the... If this makes you uncomfortable, I can take it off.

2510
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,980
So like, you know, cause it's all out there.

2511
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,120
You know, there's four of them.

2512
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,720
And I know like some of you guys only seen two.

2513
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,400
But now there's four of them.

2514
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,540
And I know that sometimes it might make you guys uncomfortable.

2515
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,220
So I can take it off too.

2516
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:33,020
Now I can also take this off as well.

2517
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:33,800
Wow!

2518
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,440
And take this off too.

2519
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:43,960
And take this off.

2520
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,220
And then I change it to... I change it to black.

2521
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:47,800
Whoa!

2522
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,180
Wow!

2523
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,320
Alright, any special requests guys?

2524
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:58,920
You guys have any special requests that you want me to do?

2525
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,000
Any combinations?

2526
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,100
Chat.

2527
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:07,360
Sorry, my belly button is like hidden right here.

2528
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,300
Sorry, my little... My pants is... Wait, is it my pants in the shed?

2529
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:12,940
Wait, no.

2530
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,420
Where's my belly button?

2531
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,820
Okay, I'm trying to figure out anatomy right now.

2532
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:27,760
I... I'm trying to figure out my anatomy.

2533
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,340
It's either like behind the shadow right now.

2534
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,540
Or it's... It's right here.

2535
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,040
I don't know.

2536
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,780
I think it's like covered by my pants right now.

2537
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,520
I'm pretty sure.

2538
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:39,680
Uh...

2539
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:44,780
I'm pretty sure.

2540
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:47,600
I'm pretty sure it's like covered by my pants.

2541
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:47,920
Oh, yeah.

2542
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,460
Oh, look at that jiggle though.

2543
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,800
I have another thing that jiggles too.

2544
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,220
Technically, it's five if you think about it.

2545
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,900
You're... You're jiggling too, guys.

2546
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:56,480
Look at that.

2547
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,840
Look at you jiggle.

2548
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,260
Okay.

2549
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,500
Let me...

2550
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:02,220
Put that up.

2551
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,380
And...

2552
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,240
And...

2553
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:17,640
I can also hold my beach ball with my gun.

2554
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:19,480
Ooh!

2555
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:20,640
See that shadow?

2556
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,560
Wow!

2557
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:21,680
Oh!

2558
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:23,760
And here's my tail too.

2559
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,360
My little tail.

2560
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:26,820
My little tail.

2561
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:27,240
Right there.

2562
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,900
By the end of me.

2563
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,760
My snorkel takes up so much space.

2564
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,480
Oh.

2565
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:48,300
Here.

2566
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,780
Oh my god, guys.

2567
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:51,820
That was a good game.

2568
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:52,540
GG's guys.

2569
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:53,440
GG's.

2570
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,180
GG's.

2571
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,240
GG's.

2572
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:58,760
Good game.

2573
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,280
Good game.

2574
01:32:59,280 --> 01:32:59,300
Good game.

2575
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:00,260
I'm so tired now.

2576
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:00,880
Whoa!

2577
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,140
Wow!

2578
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,440
Any other combinations?

2579
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,680
That you guys wanna do?

2580
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,680
No, there is aimbot.

2581
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,980
I just forgot to...

2582
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,180
Oh, wait.

2583
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:14,640
Is this?

2584
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,820
There is aimbot.

2585
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:17,140
There is aimbot.

2586
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,100
But I forgot to...

2587
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,940
I forgot to set that up.

2588
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:20,840
So...

2589
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,360
I'm sorry.

2590
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:28,030
Oh, it's a sparkleizing gun.

2591
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:29,390
Yay!

2592
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:31,030
Oh, wait.

2593
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:32,490
Let me put the...

2594
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:34,190
Wait, no.

2595
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,210
Yay!

2596
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:38,770
Let me put my shirt on.

2597
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:39,910
Yay!

2598
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:40,090
Yay!

2599
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:41,670
Pew pew!

2600
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:50,790
Uh...

2601
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:51,890
Okay.

2602
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:53,010
Okay.

2603
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:54,350
I'll do this for like...

2604
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:56,150
I'll put it up for two seconds, guys.

2605
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:56,950
I see...

2606
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:58,170
I see it!

2607
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:01,030
I'll put it up for two seconds.

2608
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:03,310
So you better get your screenshot ready.

2609
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,480
It's done.

2610
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,500
It's done!

2611
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,400
That's it!

2612
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,260
That's all you're getting!

2613
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,060
It's gone now!

2614
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:31,280
It's gone!

2615
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,700
Don't say I don't give fanservice!

2616
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:41,720
Alright, that's enough fanservice for the next year...

2617
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,120
Two years.

2618
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:43,080
You're welcome.

2619
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:45,020
Ask me again in two years, chat.

2620
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:49,560
Yeah.

2621
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,880
Yeah, ask me again in two years if you ever want...

2622
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,600
If you ever want fanservice again.

2623
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:03,910
Any other special combos that you guys want?

2624
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:07,850
Any other...

2625
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:10,190
I'll do like two more combinations, guys.

2626
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:13,630
Oh, glasses puts tired eyes?

2627
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:14,450
Yeah, I got you.

2628
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,030
There we go.

2629
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:32,190
Alright.

2630
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:33,650
One last one.

2631
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:36,230
I've been working all day...

2632
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:37,830
And all night.

2633
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:39,690
And I need to pick up this...

2634
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:42,110
I actually need to pick up this call...

2635
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:45,050
After the stream.

2636
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:51,970
Okay, I'll do the meme face.

2637
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,710
That will be the last one.

2638
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:55,650
It's like, that fits.

2639
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:56,510
Okay.

2640
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:59,650
My guy's been so loud since I've done it.

2641
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,560
There you go.

2642
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,600
There you go.

2643
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:11,720
There you go.

2644
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,360
A recreation.

2645
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,160
I don't even know how I did that so...

2646
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:14,620
I don't...

2647
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:17,780
Guys, honestly, it's actually crazy that I was able to do that so naturally.

2648
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:18,660
Like that...

2649
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:20,780
Whatever that shit the guy said...

2650
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,280
Uh...

2651
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,780
That shit actually like shook me that hard to be able to do that naturally.

2652
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:26,600
Like...

2653
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,460
It never gets old.

2654
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:29,880
Like...

2655
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,900
Whenever I...

2656
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:33,760
Like people ask me to recreate that face...

2657
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,840
It actually takes so many muscles in my face to do that.

2658
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,900
I was like, how the fuck did I...

2659
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:39,420
Holy...

2660
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,380
It was so bad.

2661
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,080
It was so fucking cringe.

2662
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,400
And like...

2663
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,500
What the fuck am I listening to?

2664
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,700
That my entire face just like...

2665
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,380
Naturally went into that...

2666
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:50,260
Into that expression.

2667
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,460
And it's crazy.

2668
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:52,740
Whenever I have to recreate it...

2669
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,380
It takes so much muscle power to do...

2670
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:55,040
Recreate it.

2671
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,680
Alright.

2672
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,940
Let's move back to...

2673
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:08,120
Let's move back to the beach, guys.

2674
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,260
Alright.

2675
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,500
Close your eyes.

2676
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,220
We're back!

2677
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,620
We're back, dragon!

2678
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,320
We're back at the beach!

2679
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:27,900
I'm trying to remember if there's anything else...

2680
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,480
I wanna announce...

2681
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,400
Or show you guys.

2682
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:31,720
Let me look at my fires.

2683
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:32,580
If there's anything.

2684
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,720
I don't know if I said everything I wanted to say.

2685
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,500
I know I said...

2686
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:40,980
I was like...

2687
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,700
I wanna show you guys this...

2688
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,360
And that...

2689
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:43,800
And that...

2690
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,660
And this...

2691
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:46,000
But...

2692
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:48,820
I don't know if that's everything.

2693
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:49,720
I wanna make sure...

2694
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:51,380
That that's everything.

2695
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:51,920
Oh yeah!

2696
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,000
By the way...

2697
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,920
For the 3D animation...

2698
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:55,640
I was super...

2699
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:55,970
Happy...

2700
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,660
Uh...

2701
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:58,280
With...

2702
01:37:58,730 --> 01:37:59,060
How...

2703
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,060
It ended up looking.

2704
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,340
Because like...

2705
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,340
I remember like...

2706
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,920
Telling them that...

2707
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,220
Um...

2708
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:07,600
When they were showing me a work in progress...

2709
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:08,880
Um...

2710
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,020
I told them...

2711
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:10,420
That like...

2712
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:11,980
The one...

2713
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:12,460
The thing...

2714
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,220
The thing I really love about the animation...

2715
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:15,520
Was that...

2716
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,960
It reminded me...

2717
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,520
Of like...

2718
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,580
The spiral...

2719
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:19,140
Outro...

2720
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:20,060
And intros...

2721
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:20,760
When they like...

2722
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,440
Go into like...

2723
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,520
The various worlds...

2724
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,800
Like the humor...

2725
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,140
The humor...

2726
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,220
And like the...

2727
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:27,240
The like...

2728
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,060
Animation for it...

2729
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:29,160
Was so like...

2730
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,340
Spiral core...

2731
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,060
And it like...

2732
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:31,760
It like...

2733
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,920
Even though like...

2734
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:33,960
Even though it wasn't like...

2735
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:34,340
You know...

2736
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,680
It's about us dragoons.

2737
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:41,920
I got hit with Spiral nostalgia from that animation in general.

2738
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:48,940
And then I was telling the sound guy, I want the sound design to be very similar to...

2739
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:52,460
Because when I saw the animation, there was no sound in it.

2740
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:58,420
They just sent me a snippet of the volleyball spike.

2741
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,980
And then I said, oh my god, this reminds me of Spiral.

2742
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:08,340
And I really wanted to have the sound design to be very similar to Spiral.

2743
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:11,480
Because of how much it just hit me with a wave of nostalgia.

2744
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:18,840
Yeah, so I'll show the animation again at the end of the stream.

2745
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,040
So you guys can see it.

2746
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,660
And then you'll also be like, oh my god, this does feel like Spiral.

2747
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:26,920
It was so good.

2748
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:27,860
It was really, really cute.

2749
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,220
Um, yeah.

2750
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,940
Um, I think it's just like the hijinks that you guys get into.

2751
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,140
You know, whenever I...

2752
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:37,880
When I'm like, trying to create the lore behind everything.

2753
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,720
That comes with doing these like, reveals and stuff.

2754
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:43,080
Um...

2755
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,460
I'm trying to remember if there's anything else I want to show you guys.

2756
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:48,820
Uh...

2757
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,960
Guys, remember when I was like...

2758
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,020
Okay, when I was like...

2759
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,000
Guys, before you go, I want to show you these things.

2760
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:55,820
So don't leave yet.

2761
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:58,600
What did I say?

2762
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,760
Does anyone remember the list I said?

2763
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,120
I was like, okay, I'm gonna do the concept.

2764
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,300
I'm gonna show the concept art.

2765
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,500
I'm gonna show the green.

2766
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,720
I'm gonna do the red screen.

2767
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,940
I'm gonna show you guys a preview of stuff that's gonna happen.

2768
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,720
Like the merch preview.

2769
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,040
No, okay.

2770
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:14,720
Cause my...

2771
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,940
I don't have my memory anymore.

2772
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,560
Wait, I just said some...

2773
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:22,180
Oh my gosh.

2774
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:25,280
The previews were in my head this entire time.

2775
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:26,640
Um...

2776
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:26,900
Oh.

2777
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:27,780
Um...

2778
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,320
What's their announcement?

2779
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,040
No, there was...

2780
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,520
The announcement was just the little...

2781
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,140
The little cute merch previews that I wanted to show you.

2782
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,300
Uh, which was...

2783
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,200
For those who missed it.

2784
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,460
It's basically like, you know...

2785
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:38,260
There's this.

2786
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,720
And then the little...

2787
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,980

2788
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,400

2789
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,360

01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:44,940

2792
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:46,440
Uh...

2793
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:46,860
You know...

2794
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,120
Your pets can have a little...

2795
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,180
Have a little bit of a Hawaiian shirt too.

2796
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:51,420
Um...

2797
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:51,780
So...

2798
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,820
I'm happy cause I actually received...

2799
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:54,960
Um...

2800
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,720
I actually received a sample...

2801
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,120

2802
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,020

01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,260
The Hawaiian shirt for your dogs.

2805
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:03,140
So like...

2806
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,000
I'm gonna see if dad would like to wear it...

2807
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,640
Wear it today.

2808
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:06,720
Hehehehe.

2809
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:07,760
Hehehehe.

2810
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:08,740
Hehehehe.

2811
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:09,820
But it's super cute.

2812
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:10,500
I'm really...

2813
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,940
I'm really happy about how it...

2814
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,180
How it came out...

2815
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:13,720
In the end.

2816
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:14,880
Here, you guys.

2817
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,320
Give me a sec.

2818
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,460
I need to blow my nose.

2819
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:21,750
Yeah.

2820
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,570
No, I'll post it when the...

2821
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:25,450
I'll post it when the shirt goes live.

2822
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:28,810
So I can use it as an ad.

2823
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:32,290
Hehehehe.

2824
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:33,390
Hehehehe.

2825
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:33,930
Hehehehe.

2826
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:34,290
I can...

2827
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:35,470
Hashtag ads.

2828
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:36,470
Hashtag PR.

2829
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:38,230
Hehehehe.

2830
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:40,730
Hehehehe.

2831
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:42,610
That's how you funnel it to the site.

2832
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:45,450
Why are you immune?

2833
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:47,450
Look, you guys already got your fanservice.

2834
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:49,230
No more blowing those...

2835
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,310
On like for two more years.

2836
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:51,770
Chat.

2837
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:53,850
For two more years.

2838
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:55,570
Hehehehe.

2839
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:55,970
Hehehehe.

2840
01:41:55,970 --> 01:42:01,190
Yeah, I sponsored myself to advertise DokiBird by DokiBird.

2841
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:08,270
Yeah, I'm really happy that you guys like the new outfit.

2842
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:09,430
I was really nervous.

2843
01:42:10,230 --> 01:42:13,810
Because, you know, I'm such a perfectionist.

2844
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:17,710
And like, I always want things to, you know, go well, of course.

2845
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:19,850
Like, every streamer wants things to go well.

2846
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:23,250
So, I was so nervous and I was so anxious and everything.

2847
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:26,290
So, I'm really happy that you guys like the new outfit.

2848
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:28,450
And my beach episode.

2849
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:30,770
And let me change color to change it.

2850
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:31,490
So, yeah.

2851
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:34,290
And then my Hawaiian mood shirt.

2852
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:37,410
And my thermal undershirt too.

2853
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:46,290
I think my favorite part about my new outfit is definitely the hair.

2854
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:48,070
I think the hairstyle is really, really cute.

2855
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:49,590
It's just, I don't know.

2856
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:52,290
It's just super cute in general.

2857
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:54,130
It's like, it's not just like a ponytail.

2858
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:55,970
It has a lot of style too.

2859
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:58,190
A lot of like DokiBird too.

2860
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:58,930
And everything.

2861
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,450
Yeah.

2862
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:00,270
Whoa.

2863
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:01,990
And then a little...

2864
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:04,270
A little wing tuffs too at the end.

2865
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:05,210
Whoa.

2866
01:43:09,330 --> 01:43:09,810
Yeah.

2867
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:12,310
A 10 out of 10 beach vibes.

2868
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:13,550
Um, alright.

2869
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:14,050
Okay.

2870
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:17,650
So, there was one thing that I wish I had this idea earlier.

2871
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:19,650
But I was also...

2872
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:20,490
I like...

2873
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:21,410
I like had...

2874
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:23,190
Like, I hate how I always get inspirations.

2875
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:25,170
Like, so last minute.

2876
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:26,410
Like, it always just hits me.

2877
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:28,270
I don't know if anyone else experienced this.

2878
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:30,530
But I always get like, really good ideas.

2879
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:32,630
And I get like, super creative.

2880
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:33,570
But I...

2881
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:34,210
I have...

2882
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,450
But it's always like, super duper last minute.

2883
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:39,570
When there's like, technically not enough time to make it happen.

2884
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:41,850
So, I think like, two days ago.

2885
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:42,570
I...

2886
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:43,870
It was like, oh my god.

2887
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:45,310
Since I'm doing a beach episode.

2888
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:48,210
I should put tomato me in a bikini.

2889
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:53,150
But...

2890
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,390
Obviously, there was no time for that.

2891
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:56,530
I was like, no!

2892
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:58,350
Why did I have this idea?

2893
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,110
No!

2894
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:01,990
I could've been...

2895
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:05,050
I could've put tomato me in a bikini for all those people.

2896
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:06,950
And then when people were like, oh man.

2897
01:44:06,970 --> 01:44:08,290
I can't believe it.

2898
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:09,290
No bikini.

2899
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:10,010
Don't keep it.

2900
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:11,370
And I'll be like...

2901
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:12,030
Oh...

2902
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:14,530
For all you bikini lovers out there.

2903
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:15,650
Don't worry.

2904
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:18,210
I got something special for you guys.

2905
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:20,230
And all the dragoons are like, oh my god.

2906
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:20,790
Oh my god.

2907
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:23,530
There's an extra toggle where she's gonna take off her shirt.

2908
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,070
And it's gonna be a bikini.

2909
01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:25,950
And then...

2910
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:26,350
BAM!

2911
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:29,270
I'll show up as a tomato in a bikini.

2912
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:30,790
But I couldn't do it.

2913
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:32,010
I couldn't do it.

2914
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:33,230
It was too last minute.

2915
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:35,070
It would've been so good.

2916
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:36,750
But it's too late now.

2917
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:37,590
It's...

2918
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:41,790
It's too late now.

2919
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:42,990
I was like...

2920
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:45,570
I know some of you guys were like, you could've done it later, Doki.

2921
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:47,290
You could've done the beta switch later.

2922
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:48,570
It wouldn't matter.

2923
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:50,790
It wouldn't be the same, chat.

2924
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:54,430
It would've been the same if I did it later.

2925
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:58,550
It would've...

2926
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:00,310
It could've been so funny.

2927
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:01,310
I mean...

2928
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:07,950
I mean...

2929
01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:10,490
Now you spoil the future trolling.

2930
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:11,690
Okay, but like...

2931
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:13,410
What if I just bring it out of nowhere?

2932
01:45:13,410 --> 01:45:14,190
It would be like...

2933
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:15,070
It would be like...

2934
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:16,470
Five months have passed.

2935
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:17,170
And then like...

2936
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:18,210
I'll be like, you know...

2937
01:45:18,210 --> 01:45:19,230
In my beach outfit.

2938
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:19,850
And I'll be like...

2939
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:20,750
Oh my god, guys.

2940
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:23,330
I have a new toddler to show you guys.

2941
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:24,690
And then, you know...

2942
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:26,690
Some of you guys are still so...

2943
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:27,690
So gullible.

2944
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:28,310
And be like...

2945
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:29,090
Oh my god!

2946
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:30,930
It must be a bikini!

2947
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:34,510
And then you'll forget all about the idea I said about tomato bikini.

2948
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:36,290
And then...

2949
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:36,650
BAM!

2950
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:37,750
Tomato bikini!

2951
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:40,970
Yeah, I'm the last day of summer!

2952
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:45,350
Just...

2953
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:47,170
That'll be my Christmas present.

2954
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:52,730
But yeah...

2955
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:54,730
I wanted to do that, too.

2956
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:56,510
I wanted to add that into the reveal.

2957
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:57,830
But it was too late, guys.

2958
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:58,410
I...

2959
01:45:58,410 --> 01:45:59,410
It was...

2960
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:00,970
It was a brilliant idea!

2961
01:46:01,290 --> 01:46:02,130
But I had...

2962
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:04,490
Why am I always so fucking creepy?

2963
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:07,330
I'm creative when I have no time to be creative!

2964
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,530
When there's no time to make my ideas happen!

2965
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:12,130
Um...

2966
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:14,270
Don't fall for it, Dragoo!

2967
01:46:19,290 --> 01:46:20,750
Because it would have been like...

2968
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,590
Oh my god!

2969
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:22,490
Oh my god!

2970
01:46:22,570 --> 01:46:25,310
I can't believe Toki has another toggle!

2971
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:27,450
It has to be a bikini!

2972
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:30,730
And then I would have like a thousand people unsubscribed after that.

2973
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:36,910
And then after I reveal the tomato bikini...

2974
01:46:36,910 --> 01:46:39,310
I lose a thousand subscribers instantly!

2975
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:41,530
Uh...

2976
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:46,370
Not again!

2977
01:46:48,290 --> 01:46:48,890
Um...

2978
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:49,610
Anyway...

2979
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:50,490
That was fun, though.

2980
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:52,370
I'm so happy that you guys...

2981
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:54,430
That you guys like the beach show.

2982
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:55,490
My beach episode.

2983
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:56,670
I don't think I've had...

2984
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:57,030
I don't think I've had...

2985
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:58,970
Yeah, I haven't done a beach outfit before.

2986
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:00,010
So...

2987
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:01,210
Um...

2988
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:02,770
Um...

2989
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:03,650
So...

2990
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:04,110
Um...

2991
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:05,430
It was exciting to...

2992
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,990
Design this with...

2993
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:07,350
Um...

2994
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,190
The auction winner.

2995
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:09,470
With the charity auction winner.

2996
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:11,790
And of course, there's a lot of...

2997
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:12,490
Outfits...

2998
01:47:12,490 --> 01:47:13,430
To look forward to.

2999
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:14,310
Um...

3000
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,250
I've been planning...

3001
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:17,470
A lot of outfits in the future.

3002
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:18,310
So...

3003
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,630
The next outfit is not...

3004
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:20,270
Um...

3005
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:20,850
Uh...

3006
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:21,490
It's like...

3007
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,650
Something I...

3008
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:23,810
Um...

3009
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:24,690
I...

3010
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:25,570
Designed...

3011
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:25,970
Or...

3012
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:27,330
Me and my mama designed.

3013
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:28,370
Um...

3014
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:28,770
So...

3015
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:31,130
Look forward to that whenever that happens.

3016
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:32,930
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3017
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:35,670
Well I have plenty of...

3018
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:37,350
Outfits that...

3019
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:40,390
I'm super excited to like release in the future.

3020
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:58,910
I know like one of them is being rigged right now and two of them is actually... another one is being like conceptualized at the moment with my mama and I've already booked another slot as well to be conceptualized in a couple of months later.

3021
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:10,370
I don't know when I'll be done rigging though because the biggest issue is just rigging wise because that takes a lot of time and you know my papa is like really really talented and amazing.

3022
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:15,450
And she's like... she does so much for like different other VTubers as well.

3023
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:18,530
So like it's obviously it's just like it takes time.

3024
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:19,710
It takes a lot of time.

3025
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:26,090
That's why it took a while for me to have you know to... it took me a year to reveal my new outfit.

3026
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:27,970
My first new outfit.

3027
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,870
But the next future outfits won't take a year.

3028
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:32,810
Okay, we're not getting an outfit a year.

3029
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:39,130
Starting now, we're not getting an outfit a year guys.

3030
01:48:39,370 --> 01:48:41,830
It's it's it's more smooth now after that.

3031
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:46,670
So look forward to that in the future.

3032
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:49,950
Um, but yeah, I hope you guys had a great time.

3033
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:52,930
I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm like...

3034
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:55,110
My mind is like all over the place.

3035
01:48:55,270 --> 01:49:01,310
I remember like texting, uh, uh, my friends and my manager and being like, I'm so nervous.

3036
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:04,570
Ah, my head... I was like, my head is all over the place.

3037
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:06,690
Ah, I hope people like it.

3038
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:11,050
What I was also worried about was because like, I know a lot of you guys are at Off Kai right now.

3039
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:12,010
And I was like, oh no.

3040
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:13,250
Oh man.

3041
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:20,770
I hope people... I hope the dragoons are able to watch the new outfit reveal because I know there's so many fun things to do at Off Kai right now.

3042
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:22,810
So I hope you guys are able to watch it.

3043
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:23,510
I'm sorry.

3044
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:26,390
I wanted to do it.

3045
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:38,530
I was like, you know, because I want to do, um, I wanted to do it on like, you know, the weekend or like Friday because, you know, um, so like more dragoons are awake around that time.

3046
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:41,950
But I was like, oh man, but a lot of you guys are on Off Kai too.

3047
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:52,200
Yeah, I think a lot of dragoons were watching on the, on their phone, um, or at their hotel room at that time.

3048
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,560
With the, uh, with Off Kai going on.

3049
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:59,120
Thank you all for coming guys for my favorite first outfit reveal.

3050
01:49:59,620 --> 01:49:59,920
Wow!

3051
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:03,640
Yeah!

3052
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,320
Maybe I'll do like...

3053
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,140
Actually, I was like thinking...

3054
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:11,860
I was like, oh, uh...

3055
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:13,080
I don't know if I want to do another...

3056
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,240
I'm so busy.

3057
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:15,820
I was like, oh, I want to stream longer.

3058
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:18,020
But I know like, I'm so busy.

3059
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:24,160
I'm like, I'll give all the stuff I have to do later.

3060
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,380
But, oh, I just want to talk to you guys more!

3061
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:32,300
But, I think I have to be responsible.

3062
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:35,240
I have to be a responsible adult.

3063
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:36,480
But don't worry.

3064
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,160
Things will cool down soon.

3065
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,000
I promise.

3066
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,580
It's just because we have a concert and birthday in, um...

3067
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:51,740
A concert and birthday stuff that I'm working on at the moment.

3068
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,560
That's in like two weeks.

3069
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,580
And that's where all my time is...

3070
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:56,500
I...

3071
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:57,120
Oh my gosh.

3072
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:57,900
No, I'm...

3073
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:03,700
I hope you guys will have a great time at Anime Expo for those who are going to the concert.

3074
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:12,220
But, I'll let you guys know, um, for the birthday stream, there is a very special announcement at the end of the birthday stream.

3075
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:17,000
So like, it is very, very ideal for you guys to stay until the very end.

3076
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:28,500
That's all I can say about the birthday stuff on July 4th.

3077
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:37,040
So, um, so like, if you guys could stay at the very end for, uh, on July 4th, for my birthday.

3078
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,760
It'll be at 5pm PST anyway.

3079
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:45,740
Like, usually, if you guys didn't notice, all my special event streams or special streams are always at like, primetime for me.

3080
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,280
Which is 5pm PST.

3081
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,980
So like, my birthday stream will be at 5pm PST.

3082
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:54,040
Because that's usually the time I stream, like, for like, special stuff.

3083
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,600
Uh, because it's primetime!

3084
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:57,320
Anyway, but yes.

3085
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:02,400
Look forward to something very, very special at the very, very end of my birthday stream on July 4th!

3086
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,420
And I...

3087
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,440
Oh, it's a lot of work!

3088
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:04,780
Ah!

3089
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:08,840
Hey, oh!

3090
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,100
I know, I...

3091
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:10,740
I knew it!

3092
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:14,360
That's when Toki's gonna debut the tomato bikini!

3093
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:16,860
Don't fall for it, dragoons!

3094
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,320
She's beating you!

3095
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:23,040
That's the birthday present for me!

3096
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,620
Hey, guys.

3097
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:28,600
I'm gonna call it here.

3098
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,760
I have a lot of stuff to do.

3099
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:35,420
Um, I have a lot of stuff to do in the next couple of weeks.

3100
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:39,400
It's like crunch time right now for the concert and my birthday stuff.

3101
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,200
So I'm gonna head out now.

3102
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,800
But I hope you guys enjoyed...

3103
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:47,680
Um, I hope you guys enjoyed my beach episode, everybody.

3104
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:54,700
Um, as always, everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3105
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,920
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it!

3106
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,780
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

3107
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:02,300
Bye, guys!

3108
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:03,480
Bye!

3109
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:06,600
I also replayed the...

3110
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,100
The dragoon video, too.

3111
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:09,060
Uh, but don't worry.

3112
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:14,980
I'll skip the intro a little bit, because that was like a little bit of a beta switch where it was just an empty background, cause you'll be like, oh, where's Toki?

3113
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,420
And then, poof, there's the dragoon!

3114
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:21,840
Anyway, I'll make it so that you guys can see that little animation again.

3115
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:37,860
I'm planning on like, when we have more and more of these little lore videos, these little like animated lore videos with you dragoons, like, it's like a little cartoon segment, like, um, the misadventures of, uh, of dragoon, of the dragoon gang or some shit.

3116
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:45,360
And I'll make, like, a little compilation of all these little miniature cartoons that we've done.

3117
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,440
Um, anyway, I'll show that video again.

3118
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,540
I'll see you guys later, everybody!

3119
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:49,480
Bye-bye, everyone!

3120
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:50,240
Bye!

3121
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:25,010
Oh, sorry about that.

3122
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:26,910
Oh, can you pass the ball back?
