00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,100
Hello,

2
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,020
everybody!

3
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,380
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,380
I have a cool new overlay now.

5
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,320
Huge shoutout to the person who did my Apex overlay as well.

6
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,480
I'm sorry if I pronounced your name wrong.

7
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,860
Artatee... Art... Art... Art... Art... Art... I'm sorry.

8
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,820
I'm tired.

9
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,500
Art... Artatee... Artatee!

10
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,480
Artatee!

11
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,760
Thank you!

12
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:20,820
I think I played, like, almost 20 hours of Marvel Rivals the last two days on stream.

13
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,920
My brain is, like, mush right now.

14
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,000
It's fucking...

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,600
You know how SK fucking was like, I'm gonna head to bed?

16
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,100
I found out she kept playing Marvel Rivals.

17
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,520
Fucking liar.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,180
She... She... She's also in too deep.

19
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,240
She's...

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,860
She has it worse than me.

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,580
There's no saving us.

22
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,900
There's no fucking saving us.

23
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,800
She... She's in too deep.

24
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,080
She kept going.

25
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,400
And then she was like... And I was, like, in her... I was watching her stream.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,580
And I was like... And then she was like, maybe I'll stop queuing.

27
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,980
And I was like, no, keep going.

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,760
You could be... Because she got to top...

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:12,880
Okay, and then the thing is, the most fucked up part is that she got good lobbies right after I left.

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,080
Like, all her lobbies were, like, good tanks, good DPS, good support players.

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,920
Like... And I'm like, what the fuck?

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,520
Am I the problem?

33
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,580
I was like, what the fuck?

34
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,880
And then she got that three times in a row.

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,520
Three times in a row with good lobbies.

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,160
Like, no one trolling.

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,100
No one doing 2-2.

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,420
Everybody doing 2-2-2.

39
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,580
Everyone being good at their roles.

40
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,000
And then she got to top, like... And then she got, like, ranked 335 or some shit.

41
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,760
And in my head, I was just like...

42
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:56,880
What?

43
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,780
She won three games back-to-back.

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
And I'm just like, where was my three games?

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,580
Where the fuck was... Where the fuck were my three games?

46
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
I needed those three games!

47
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,840
Where the fuck was it?

48
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,780
Where...

49
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,800
So,

50
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,960
and then she was like, I'm gonna stop here at rank 300-something.

51
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
And I was like, in her chat, I was like, no.

52
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,580
Because if you win one more game, you'll be top 200, SK.

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,700
You should keep going.

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
And then she kept going.

55
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,020
And then she lost.

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,600
And then my job here was done.

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,920
Curse of Doki.

58
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,140
You're evil.

59
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,500
And that's how you do... And then she ended on a loss.

60
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,600
Everyone must suffer.

61
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,840
Everyone must suffer.

62
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,340
Anyway, we hit 800k subscribers!

63
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,700
And we're celebrating it with Guerrilla Marvel Rivals Ranked Stream.

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
As we should.

65
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
You know what?

66
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
As it should be.

67
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,740
Let's hope.

68
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,940
Guys, alright, so we need four games.

69
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
We just need four games.

70
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,100
If we're lucky, we might be able to win four back-to-back-to-back games.

71
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,140
If Shortfur doesn't decide to go fucking Wolverine and our team...

72
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,920
Oh yeah, or like, I don't know.

73
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,500
And then, I don't know, they're gonna ban characters.

74
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,260
As long as they don't ban, like, characters that, like...

75
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,240
No, he's, like, versatile.

76
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,920
He can play anything, honestly.

77
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,960
But we just need four games.

78
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,860
Guys, was it three games yesterday?

79
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,800
Well, the thing is, I don't know if you guys know this.

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,960
But people are climbing rank when I go to bed.

81
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,040
So, it's not like I go to bed and everything just stops.

82
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,660
Because we're not in the Matrix.

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,040
Like, I'm the main character and I go to sleep and everyone just pauses.

84
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:18,900
Or something.

85
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,840
So, yes, now it's four games.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,700
Because people kept ranking up.

87
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,980
So, the cut-off is now Diamond 2.

88
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,440
So, we just need to make it to Diamond 2 right now.

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,880
We just need to beat Diamond 2.

90
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,340
And things will be okay.

91
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,800
And then, if we're lucky, it'll be back to back to back to...

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,360
Guys, if we don't get Top 500 today, you know what's gonna happen to God of War.

93
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,580
You fucking know what's gonna happen to God of War.

94
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,520
And then, if we don't get it there, I'm gonna cancel God of War.

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm gonna get in 3D at the concert and play Marvel Rivals.

96
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,580
I will fucking play Marvel Rivals at the concert if we don't get Top 500, guys.

97
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,180
I swear to fucking God.

98
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,240
I'll be like, there's no concert, guys.

99
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm gonna be playing Marvel.

100
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,620
I'm taking you all hostage.

101
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm taking all of you hostage with me.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,060
We have to get Top 500 today, chat.

103
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:30,820
We...

104
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,780
I don't care.

105
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,100
Next, thank you for the magenta soup.

106
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,100
Thank you, thank you.

107
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,680
Hi, Doki.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,380
Congratulations for the 800k.

109
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,500
Hope you have a great day.

110
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,700
I wanted to thank you again for putting my dumb art in the thumbnail.

111
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Wish you good luck for the 14th.

112
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,180
Thank you for the magenta soup.

113
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,180
Thank you, thank you.

114
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,700
We actually had a different art for it on the thumbnail.

115
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,830
But then luckily, when I woke up, you posted that artwork.

116
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,780
And then I instantly messaged my thumbnail maker.

117
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
And I was like, change it, please.

118
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,400
Okay, I didn't say change it.

119
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,100
But I was like, can we use this?

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
I was much more polite.

121
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,780
I was like, oh, can we swap it to this artwork instead?

122
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,300
But yes, we're celebrating 800k by playing Marvel Rivals Rink.

123
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,640
I do have something very special planned for the 800k milestone.

124
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,100
But I didn't think we were going to hit it that fast.

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,260
I don't know how the fuck I got 2k subscribers when all I've been doing is playing Marvel Rivals.

126
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,660
Like, I was not doing anything special.

127
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,600
I was literally just no-lifing Marvel Rivals for 20 plus hours.

128
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,920
So like, I don't know how the fuck we managed to get 2k within two days from that.

129
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,740
But...

130
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,060
I ain't complaining.

131
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
I'm not going to complain.

132
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,260
But yes, I'm so proud of all of you guys for helping me get this far.

133
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,260
Let's hope we can get 1 million by next year, by the end of 2025.

134
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,640
1 million by the end of 2025.

135
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,460
That's our goal for next year.

136
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,900
But yes, thank you guys so much.

137
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
I want to be more mushy right now.

138
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,900
I really, really want to be more mushy about the 800k.

139
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,540
But it's grinding hours.

140
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,620
We'll be mushy later.

141
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,080
I need to lock the fuck in, guys.

142
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,860
We need to get out of the fucking trenches right now.

143
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,980
Alright, we're going to do a quick play.

144
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,140
Just to warm up.

145
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,740
We'll be mushy.

146
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,720
Guys, I promise.

147
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,720
I'll be mushy later.

148
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,040
I need to lock in right now.

149
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:44,280
I need to get this over with.

150
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,380
Like, please.

151
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,940
I can't keep doing this.

152
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,420
I will literally play Marble Rivals at the concert and we don't get top 500.

153
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:05,580
I'm going to connect the PC to the broadcast and be like, it's Marble Rivals time.

154
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,020
You know what, let's play Mantis.

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,180
Let's practice Mantis.

156
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,340
This is quick play anyway.

157
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,880
This is a quick match.

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,480
Don't, Toki.

159
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,580
Don't.

160
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,280
No, don't say that, guys.

161
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,220
No, guys, don't say that.

162
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,780
Also, the reason why we're this early is because I don't know why Marble Rivals hasn't sponsored me yet.

163
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm saying yet because I'm hopeful that they realize I exist again.

164
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,520
Like, oh my god, they noticed my existence during Alpha and Beta.

165
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,420
I think it's because there's Twitch drops for Marble Rivals on Twitch.

166
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,180
And like, I'm not streaming it on Twitch.

167
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,300
So that's why they're like...

168
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:54,260
I think they mostly sponsored all the Twitch people because there is Twitch drops.

169
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,780
I know I should be streaming it on Twitch, but I want to document my top 500 journey on YouTube.

170
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,800
So that's why I'm on YouTube.

171
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,160
But I think for future rank climbs, I might...

172
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,280
Because a lot of the rank climbs I'm going to do after this will be very impromptu.

173
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,400
So it'll be very sporadic and random.

174
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,420
If I want to do it on stream...

175
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,380
And most likely, if I want to do it on stream in the future after this, it'll mostly be on Twitch.

176
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,080
Mostly.

177
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,180
Some of them might be on...

178
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,720
I might do some of them on...

179
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,360
Oh my god.

180
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,260
Guys, shoot this!

181
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,660
Shoot this!

182
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,340
It's not that difficult!

183
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,490
Oh my god.

184
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,240
Guys.

185
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,320
Am I the only support?

186
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,640
Oh, yes I am.

187
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,140
Oh my god, I didn't even realize.

188
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Wait, I'm the only support.

189
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,300
Okay, Mantis is not good for solo support.

190
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Okay, I guess...

191
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,580
Back to the Luna life I go.

192
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,820
I didn't realize I was the only support.

193
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,300
I...

194
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,620
I didn't realize.

195
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,000
Back to the...

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,460
If I knew, I would not have fucking played how I played.

197
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
But at least...

198
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,520
Bitch.

199
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,620
I'm so bad at playing rank.

200
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,620
Oh yeah, you can't...

201
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,960
Oh my god, you're so bad.

202
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,900
You had higher DPS than me.

203
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,450
Oh my god.

204
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,510
Oh wait, did I...

205
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,630
Okay, no, I just joined it.

206
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,570
Alright, what rank am I?

207
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,030
I am Diamond 3 right now.

208
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,030
It's fine, it's quick play.

209
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,570
I...

210
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,450
This is just warming up my mechanical.

211
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,950
So like, I don't care if we lose this one.

212
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,130
Is this...

213
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,270
Literally, that's all she's doing.

214
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,170
She's just DPSing.

215
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,910
That Mantis isn't even healing.

216
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm just practicing mechanical stuff because...

217
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,780
Oh yeah, he's definitely practicing too.

218
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah, that Black Panther is definitely practicing too.

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,480
These are...

220
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,360
This is not...

221
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,420
You're not Diamond players, that's for sure.

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,920
Hahaha.

223
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,640
Yeah, you okay there?

224
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,300
You guys okay?

225
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,620
Woooo.

226
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,780
Yeah, you guys okay?

227
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,620
Bro, I fought actual Black Panther mains, guys.

228
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,800
You okay there, Black Panther?

229
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,600
Do you need help?

230
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,540
You need help?

231
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,900
You need help there?

232
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,360
Oh, I should help them.

233
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,720
Woah!

234
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,900
Woah!

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Dance, everybody!

236
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,240
Dance!

237
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,960
Woooo!

238
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,600
Keep dancing!

239
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,040
Alright, now I leave.

240
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,380
You idiot.

241
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,400
Hahaha.

242
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,200
I have to fight actual ex-pro players.

243
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,890
Get on my level.

244
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,650
Actually know how to play your character.

245
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,570
The game came out three days ago.

246
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,150
They're actually...

247
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,990
Hahaha.

248
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,310
You should know how to play this game after three days.

249
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,530
You should...

250
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,330
Hahaha.

251
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,390
That's okay.

252
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,650
Yeah, that's why I said it.

253
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,010
You should actually know how to play this game.

254
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,710
Alright.

255
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,450
It's actually crazy that this game came out like three to four days ago.

256
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,070
And already people are like so good at it.

257
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,190
It's actually crazy.

258
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,110
Hahaha.

259
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,510
How good people are already.

260
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,910
Yeah, I'm just practicing mechanical.

261
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,870
I'm not like actually focused on healing.

262
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,010
I need to like warm up my...

263
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,650
Fucking...

264
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,110
They sponsored Surefour!

265
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,790
Like if...

266
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,350
Hahaha.

267
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,010
If they can sponsor Surefour, then like...

268
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,290
I'm honestly...

269
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,730
I'm fucking...

270
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,150
I'm like a tamer version of him.

271
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,110
Like...

272
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,730
Come on.

273
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,270
Actually...

274
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,050
Hahaha.

275
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,430
Hahaha.

276
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,230
If any...

277
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,410
He said more fucked up shit than I've ever said in my life.

278
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,170
Hahaha.

279
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,110
Like...

280
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,110
On stream.

281
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,350
On stream too.

282
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,780
If anything, I look like I'm on PBS while...

283
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,340
Hahaha.

284
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,440
If anything, if I'm compared to Surefour, I'm literally PBS kids.

285
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,200
This is the day.

286
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,860
Today is the day.

287
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,060
Four games.

288
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,440
Four games.

289
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
This is the day.

290
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,100
We just need...

291
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,460
Four games, guys.

292
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,240
Four...

293
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,820
Four fucking games.

294
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,320
Oh yeah.

295
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,820
I should tell him...

296
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm...

297
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,980
I'm R.

298
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,840
I'm R.

299
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,580
To...

300
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,220
To game.

301
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,840
Oh yeah, but...

302
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah, anyway.

303
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,020
That's what I was saying.

304
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,140
Um...

305
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,300
The reason why I'm this early was because of...

306
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,940
I mean, I do...

307
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,620
SK did say she was...

308
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,420
Uh...

309
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,720
Apparently she...

310
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:15,740
Uh...

311
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,520
The...

312
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,640
Uh...

313
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,800
The collab with Brian...

314
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,220
Was actually tomorrow, not today.

315
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,720
Because scheduling's hard.

316
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,440
Uh...

317
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,460
And time zones are hard.

318
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,180
Even though, like, we're all in NA.

319
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,760
Uh...

320
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,300
Hahaha.

321
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,820
So, she's down to play whenever too.

322
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,900
But now it's like...

323
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,420
No, I need to get this over with fast.

324
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,760
So, like, I still get to...

325
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,860
I don't have to reschedule my announcement stream.

326
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,980
I mean...

327
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,200
The announcement will still be there.

328
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,420
It's just that instead of doing the other thing that I wanted to do for my announcement stream...

329
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,200
We're just gonna be playing Marvel Rivals.

330
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,520
But, if I get top 500...

331
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,240
You know...

332
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,400
If I get top 500, like...

333
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,100
Okay, we're gonna give it to Spider-Man.

334
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,980
Because he's just gonna be fucking jumping everywhere.

335
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,420
But if I get to...

336
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,320
Get it then...

337
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,740
Then...

338
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,280
Hah...

339
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,460
We can still keep it.

340
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:58,940
You know?

341
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,380
It's fine.

342
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,960
The Spider-Man deserves to die anyway.

343
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,220
I even hate my own Spider-Man.

344
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,180
Hey, guys.

345
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,440
Heal me.

346
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,780
Heal me.

347
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,710
You better get damaged so I can heal myself.

348
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,880
Okay, I guess not.

349
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,380
What is he shooting at?

350
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,220
Are you okay?

351
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,560
Are you fucking okay?

352
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,500
Like...

353
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,220
Do you need...

354
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,820
Do you need to see an eye doctor?

355
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,920
There's no one there.

356
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,080
Who are the...

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,600
Doki...

358
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,160
Bro, he's...

359
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,140
Going through PTSD.

360
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,780
Doki.

361
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,680
Like...

362
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,240
Chill.

363
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,200
Bro, he's...

364
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
He's seeing things right now.

365
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,800
He's just like...

366
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,560
He's like...

367
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,120
Oh my god.

368
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,460
There's demons in the walls.

369
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,080
He's fighting his demons.

370
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,260
Yeah, I was just like...

371
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,180
The fuck is he...

372
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,100
Oh my god.

373
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,700
I fucking...

374
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
I'm gonna punch a man right now.

375
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
Alright, I got him.

376
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,020
I put the healing orb on him because after seeing him shoot a wall, I think he is the most special one that needs it.

377
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,820
The most.

378
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,140
Honestly.

379
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,860
After what I just saw.

380
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,520
Oh shit.

381
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,360
Alright.

382
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,040
Yay!

383
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,220
Dance everybody!

384
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,920
Dance your pain away!

385
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,660
Woooo!

386
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,420
Can't be sad if you're dancing!

387
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,720
Oh my god.

388
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,900
Fuck your stupid Ankh.

389
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,830
Alright.

390
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,670
It's fine.

391
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,650
It's fine.

392
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,730
Okay, we win this and like...

393
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,370
Sure, for us to wait.

394
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,690
Because I lied and was like...

395
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,150
I'm ready.

396
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,210
Because I thought they were gonna win.

397
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,470
Oops.

398
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:23,550
Alright.

399
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,310
How far is his game left?

400
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,950
I'm gonna check.

401
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,290
I was just like...

402
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:27,910
Yeah, I'm ready!

403
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,730
Even though I wasn't actually.

404
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,730
I just assumed that he's gonna fucking...

405
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,870
I was gonna lose this one.

406
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,160
So we'll see.

407
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Also like...

408
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,580
Boger.

409
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,800
I heard...

410
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,220
Boger?

411
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
Is that his name?

412
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,300
The Overwatch...

413
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,200
Tank player?

414
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,460
Who's now a...

415
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,640
Marvel Rivals...

416
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,160
Tank player?

417
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,380
I'll never understand tank players.

418
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,000
And like...

419
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Their love for tanks.

420
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,120
I'm sorry for any of...

421
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,680
Anyone else...

422
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,880
That like...

423
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,620
Is a tank main.

424
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,920
But I don't understand.

425
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,860
I...

426
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,300
I feel like playing as a tank...

427
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,340
Is just...

428
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,820
Asking to get like...

429
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,060
Cyberbullied in game.

430
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,600
Because like...

431
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,360
You're literally the game's punching bag.

432
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,100
So...

433
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,460
I'm like...

434
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,740
Like I...

435
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,760
I don't know how...

436
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,840
You guys have very...

437
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,980
Very strong mental.

438
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,120
You guys have...

439
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,420
Incredibly strong mental...

440
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,780
To be able to play tank...

441
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,820
Like...

442
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,760
Tank for so long.

443
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,600
And...

444
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,300
Yeah, but like...

445
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,480
Playing support...

446
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,300
I don't get beat up by 200,000 people.

447
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,680
Like...

448
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,000
That's the thing.

449
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,800
I don't get beat up by everybody.

450
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,820
Like, look at this story.

451
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,700
Look at this story.

452
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,160
All...

453
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,100
Look at this story.

454
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,040
There were three men on him.

455
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,660
There were so many guys on that guy.

456
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,760
That's crazy.

457
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,700
Oh!

458
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,160
Okay, anyway...

459
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,360
Anyway, as I was saying...

460
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,660
He was like...

461
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,080
He was like...

462
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,240
Wanting to duo or stack in the future.

463
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,840
And I was like...

464
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,560
Sure, I'm down.

465
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm down.

466
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,660
So, potentially...

467
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
Potentially, a future collab with him.

468
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,360
After he followed me on Twitter.

469
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,400
See, peer pressure works, guys.

470
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,340
If you...

471
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,080
First off, I can't believe he asked for a collab when he wasn't even following me.

472
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,300
Like...

473
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,180
But...

474
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,360
But...

475
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,700
I peer pressured him into following me.

476
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,720
So like, everything is fine now.

477
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,820
It's fine.

478
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,440
Oh my god.

479
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,280
That was sad for that guy.

480
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,460
See, peer pressure works.

481
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,540
Follow them out and then you get what you want.

482
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,440
Like, woah.

483
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,400
Even though, like, technically he holds a lot of cards.

484
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,360
Like, cause like what?

485
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,520
He's like...

486
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,740
One of the best Dr. Strange players, right?

487
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm like, wow.

488
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,520
A free tank?

489
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,420
And I made him follow me?

490
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,700
Let's fucking go.

491
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,200
A free tank duo?

492
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
Oh my god.

493
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,140
To make the game easier for me?

494
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,980
But yet...

495
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,780
But yet, I forced him to follow me?

496
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,620
It was like, apparently one of the...

497
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,840
Oh my god!

498
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,180
Oh my god, I live.

499
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,320
Oh my god.

500
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,300
As long as I live, that's all that matters.

501
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,060
I'm sorry.

502
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,320
Oh my god, what?

503
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,200
Yet, I'm making the demands?

504
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,100
The power moves.

505
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,840
Alright.

506
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,600
It's okay.

507
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,900
As long as I don't die to this shark, it's fine.

508
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,740
I actually died by real skill.

509
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,400
I say as the guy just literally just punched me in the death.

510
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,800
Guys, punching is very hard, okay?

511
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,160
Like, do you see those hands?

512
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,860
That shit's scary.

513
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,510
Alright, nice.

514
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,350
You see, the key to getting what you want is just to be very confident.

515
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,850
Even though you know you...

516
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,230
You just fake it till you make it.

517
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,650
Even if you know you don't have the credentials to actually be that confident.

518
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,910
The key is to just...

519
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,770
You know what, fuck this guy.

520
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,930
Fuck this guy.

521
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,490
Oh, you're gonna fucking run?

522
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,250
Oh, you're gonna run?

523
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,170
I'm gonna fucking...

524
00:23:59,170 --> 00:23:59,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

525
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,210
Sorry.

526
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,390
You would not have died if I just stayed there.

527
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,350
I didn't stay there.

528
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,130
The key was that I did not stay there.

529
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,190
That's awkward.

530
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,890
I wanted to chase.

531
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,910
I don't know what to say.

532
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,550
I just really wanted to chase him.

533
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,710
I think, like, he, like, ulted.

534
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,450
He ulted the staircase.

535
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,210
Oh my...

536
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:39,670
Where?

537
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,870
Oh my god, the Ankh is behind me.

538
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,670
It was that fucker's fault.

539
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,770
He stood next to me.

540
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,490
I was literally there first.

541
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,390
Like, what was wrong with you?

542
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,990
I was literally standing at the point first.

543
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,150
Skate, skate, skate.

544
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,290
There's no way.

545
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,150
Oh, he got off point.

546
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,630
Nice.

547
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:05,670
Yeah!

548
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,750
We won that.

549
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,090
We won our first fucking...

550
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,690
We won our first quick play.

551
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,890
Alright, let me see how far he is from this game.

552
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,690
Okay, they're still defending.

553
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,630
Okay, this is gonna...

554
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,690
This is gonna take a while.

555
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:25,690
Oh...

556
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,150
This is a...

557
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,790
Oh, won't play Spider-Man again.

558
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,210
That guy...

559
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,530
I was gonna say, that game was hard.

560
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,430
That game was so chill.

561
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,210
That game was so chill compared to, like, what I had to go through.

562
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,130
Like...

563
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:37,930
Oh my god.

564
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,210
They're still defending.

565
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,930
Alright, we'll do practice range.

566
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,570
Because if I do another quick play, I feel like...

567
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,750
I feel like...

568
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,730
They'll be done...

569
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,070
They'll be done in the middle of my next quick play.

570
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:56,810
Try...

571
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,850
We'll look at the practice range.

572
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,510
I hate that...

573
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,390
I hate that, like, they kill so fast.

574
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,610
The Moon Knight...

575
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,690
I wanna be really...

576
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,090
I wanna be good at Mantis.

577
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,550
Her...

578
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,530
Her projectile...

579
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,670
I don't know her speed.

580
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,950
The projectile speed is so weird.

581
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,130
That's, like, my only issue.

582
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,730
This projectile speed is so weird.

583
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,830
That, like, I can't figure it out yet.

584
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,190
Because, like, all the characters have different projectile speed.

585
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,250
So, like, you gotta be, like...

586
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,290
Especially when you're, like...

587
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,390
Luna's projectile speed is different from Mantis's projectile speed.

588
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,050
So...

589
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,250
Like...

590
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,510
It's so hard to figure it out.

591
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,110
Like, it's so hard to transition.

592
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,030
No, it's projectile.

593
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,730
It's not hitscan.

594
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,030
See?

595
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,250
If it's hitscan, it'd be...

596
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,410
It's not hitscan.

597
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,670
I'm pretty sure it's not hitscan.

598
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,090
It feels like projectile.

599
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,870
Yeah, see?

600
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,270
If it was hitscan, this would be instant.

601
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,290
This is projectile.

602
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,070
Yeah, Luna...

603
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,490
Luna...

604
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:04,950
Oh, yeah, Luna.

605
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,990
No, Luna's hitscan.

606
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,850
Luna's hitscan.

607
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,490
I feel very comfortable on Luna.

608
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,310
Because she is hitscan.

609
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,490
See?

610
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,690
So, like...

611
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,090
This is...

612
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,970
Hitscan is, like...

613
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,670
This is instant.

614
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,050
That's why it's so easy to aim with her.

615
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,270
Because...

616
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,890
It's instant and, like, there's barely falloff.

617
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,870
Dammit.

618
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,050
Falloff, in general...

619
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,850
There's no falloff.

620
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,290
So, that's instant.

621
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,090
But then...

622
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,230
Mantis, you should see that there's a delay.

623
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:32,950
So, like...

624
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,810
It fucks with me because I play Luna.

625
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,830
And then...

626
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,170
I play Luna...

627
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,310
So, when I swap from Luna to Mantis...

628
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,130
My aim is, like, already on hitscan mode.

629
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,470
And I've always been really bad at projectiles.

630
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,170
So, it's like...

631
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,730
I hate it.

632
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,530
It's so difficult.

633
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,630
Yeah.

634
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,070
There's, like, the delay.

635
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,050
I hate the delay.

636
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,730
I fucking hate projectile.

637
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,010
And there's, like...

638
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,100
I think Cloak is just...

639
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,310
Cloak and Dagger is just...

640
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,550
Left click.

641
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,370
I don't have to worry.

642
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,110
Let's see.

643
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,790
This is also projectile, but, like...

644
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,870
It's not that bad.

645
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,450
Because, like...

646
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,430
I feel like as Cloak and Dagger...

647
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,330
You're not focused on DPS.

648
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,590
As Cloak and Dagger.

649
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,430
Because their heals are, like...

650
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,390
Like, not on...

651
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,750
Not on Dagger.

652
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,790
Mostly on Cloak, if you wanna do DPS.

653
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,810
Because it's just easier.

654
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,650
But...

655
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,730
I think, like...

656
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,610
For Cloak and...

657
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,470
For Dagger...

658
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,270
If you're on Dagger, it's mostly focused on the heals.

659
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,570
And then, if you really wanna do DPS...

660
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,550
You just swap to Cloak.

661
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,530
I don't like playing Loki.

662
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,270
I think, like, he's so situational.

663
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,710
Now...

664
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,870
Loki was so strong in Beta and Alpha.

665
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,910
But they nerfed him so much.

666
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,690
His DPS was so good.

667
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,790
I think if you like playing DPS healer...

668
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,870
Then you go Loki.

669
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,850
But even then, I think...

670
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,490
Mantis is a stronger Loki.

671
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,410
Because, like, Mantis' DPS is, like...

672
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:15,970
So good.

673
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,390
I don't know exactly...

674
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,210
Like, I don't know.

675
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,470
I feel like...

676
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,530
The only reason I'd say you go Loki...

677
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,230
Is if they have too many aggression ults.

678
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,510
So you can do this.

679
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,790
So you can block all the aggression ults...

680
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,950
Without having to use an ult.

681
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,310
And then, his ult is an extra.

682
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,830
And then, his ult...

683
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,510
If you wanna use it as a defense or aggression...

684
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,110
That's all I could think.

685
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,970
Like, it's his clones and...

686
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,670
But I feel like...

687
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,810
He's, like...

688
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,210
I feel like Mantis is just a better pick.

689
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,170
In general.

690
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,930
Instead of just Loki.

691
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,730
Because, like, you're compensating for the lack of heals, too.

692
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,970
By playing Loki.

693
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,090
Because he doesn't heal that much.

694
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,550
I feel like his healing output is not that good.

695
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,610
Versus, like...

696
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,250
Versus, like, the others.

697
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,470
I don't know.

698
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,510
I know, like, some people play him in higher elo.

699
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,210
But I feel like Mantis is just a better pick in general.

700
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,930
If I had to pick between...

701
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,110
Yeah, and then Mantis can, like...

702
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,150
Can damage boost.

703
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,970
That's the thing.

704
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,790
Like, I can literally damage boost.

705
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,490
And it's so easy to get...

706
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,750
Get this back.

707
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,850
Like, the damage boost and stuff.

708
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,370
And I know Adam's really strong.

709
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,150
The only one that I know that's not really meta is Jeff.

710
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,870
But, like, Adam's really strong just for the res.

711
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,050
But I don't think he's, like...

712
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,290
He's, like, great in terms of healing output.

713
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,710
You have to have a really good other support to be able to play Adam.

714
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,070
I feel like.

715
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,870
Because then, like, his ult is such a game changer.

716
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,790
But then you have to...

717
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,790
You have to have a really good support partner.

718
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,750
IMO.

719
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,770
Yeah, I know this attack is good.

720
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,530
Like, he's just a DPS healer.

721
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,230
Also.

722
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,410
Yeah, he just has...

723
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:05,750
He's, like...

724
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,310
A lot of these are just DPS healers.

725
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,130
But to be a DPS healer, you have to have a good main support.

726
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,630
Because Adam's obviously...

727
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,790
I think Adam's a flex support.

728
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,510
Adam and Loki are obviously flex supports.

729
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,690
But, like...

730
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,550
Even so.

731
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,710
You have to be, like, able to...

732
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:21,910
Aim.

733
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,630
You wanna be a good Adam.

734
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,750
But, like, a lot of the worst part about, like...

735
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,230
Adam.

736
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,010
And Loki.

737
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,430
Is that a lot of really bad Adam and Loki players.

738
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,410
They...

739
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,350
All they do is DPS.

740
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,430
They don't even heal.

741
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,310
So it's so frustrating.

742
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,730
It's, like...

743
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,610
It's really frustrating because...

744
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,050
A lot of bad Adam and Loki players don't fucking heal people.

745
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,770
They just rely on the DPS part.

746
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,770
And to build ult.

747
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,110
And then use the ult to change the game.

748
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,390
So it's, like...

749
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,170
Frustrating to play with these guys.

750
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,050
But then, like...

751
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,370
I can always rely on Amantis to do her job.

752
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,590
But, like...

753
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,610
I can't always rely on...

754
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,730
Wait!

755
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,610
Does Surefour do rank to plat?

756
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,490
HAHAHA!

757
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,690
Sorry.

758
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,430
HAHAHA!

759
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,520
HAHAHA!

760
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,080
No, he's gonna...

761
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,960
He's gonna fucking...

762
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,880
No, I feel like he's gonna...

763
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,380
Not me.

764
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,240
If I say anything...

765
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,200
I feel like he's gonna fucking lose on purpose.

766
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,580
So I'd be in this elo.

767
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,200
HAHAHA!

768
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,640
HAHAHA!

769
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,420
HAHAHA!

770
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,000
HAHAHA!

771
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,600
HAHAHA!

772
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,680
I know I shouldn't be toxic.

773
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,000
HAHAHA!

774
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,340
HAHAHA!

775
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,120
HAHAHA!

776
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:54,980
No.

777
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,700
Don't.

778
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,440
We can't have any curses, guys.

779
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,540
We...

780
00:32:59,540 --> 00:32:59,960
HAHAHA!

781
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,440
We can't have any fucking curses, chat.

782
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,780
HAHAHA!

783
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,860
Oh!

784
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,680
No Curse of Ra!

785
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,980
HAHAHA!

786
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,180
Guys.

787
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,780
That's good that he's plat.

788
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,520
It's good that he's plat, chat.

789
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,560
Because, like...

790
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,100
With him being plat...

791
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,660
That means we don't have hero bans yet.

792
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,100
We don't need to have hero bans.

793
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,380
HAHAHA!

794
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,320
Guys, don't...

795
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,360
Guys...

796
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,040
HAHAHA!

797
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,800
Guys, don't do this to me, guys.

798
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:35,820
HAHAHA!

799
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,820
We need to get out of this fucking garage again, man.

800
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,840
We can't go back to the circus, guys.

801
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,720
We can't go back to the circus, chat.

802
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm tired.

803
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,220
I'm so tired of the circus.

804
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,120
Please.

805
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,660
I don't know why I'm streaming the game.

806
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,060
I didn't realize the game awards were today.

807
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,860
I feel like today...

808
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,320
I feel like it's been...

809
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,120
I don't know.

810
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,720
I feel like lately the game awards has been...

811
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,760
Has been, like...

812
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,880
Falling off.

813
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,660
More and more.

814
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,740
That, like...

815
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,860
I'm just not as...

816
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,340
I'm not even hyped about...

817
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,040
Like, the only reason to watch the game awards is just for the trailers.

818
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,360
But, like...

819
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,660
Even then, I'm just like...

820
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
What is it gonna...

821
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,340
Like, I know, like...

822
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,380
Oh, maybe, like...

823
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,280
World premiere.

824
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,360
But even then, I'm like...

825
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
I'm not, like, super...

826
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,700
Like...

827
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,040
Woo!

828
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,540
Game awards!

829
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,200
I know it's just for the ads.

830
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,620
But, like...

831
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,060
I don't know.

832
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,900
I'm not, like, super, like...

833
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,280
Woo!

834
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,860
Game awards!

835
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,380
Woo!

836
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,940
HAHAHA!

837
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:44,860
Alright.

838
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,400
He's gotta play Hawkeye now.

839
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,500
Cause that's the last time he's ever gonna play Hawkeye.

840
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,960
Before they ban him and...

841
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,740
Diamond...

842
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,780
This is, like, his last day on Hawkeye.

843
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,140
There's no way he's gonna be allowed to play him after this.

844
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,540
Oh, he's so low.

845
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,380
I'm confident that...

846
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,440
Every game in Diamond after that...

847
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,280
Will...

848
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,460
Okay.

849
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,020
Guys.

850
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,360
You look at me and I look at you!

851
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,200
Nice.

852
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,620
Okay.

853
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,660
He's so low.

854
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,880
Nice.

855
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,520
It's fine.

856
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,420
She's just poking me.

857
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,460
I had to worry about the giant fucking Hulk in front of me first.

858
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,280
Okay.

859
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,380
The Hulk was...

860
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
The Hulk in front of me was a lot scarier...

861
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,620
Than anything else behind me.

862
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,340
Wait, did he, like, die already?

863
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,860
Did he got out of his mech already?

864
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,820
That was fast.

865
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,160
Oh, they're planning on...

866
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,460
Okay.

867
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,820
Healing, I'm healing.

868
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,160
I'm keeping everybody alive.

869
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,560
The first ranked game is always, like...

870
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,400
I'm fucking...

871
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm waking up still.

872
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,560
I got...

873
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,980
I drank some gamer subs today.

874
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,980
By the way, guys.

875
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,860
Did you guys know?

876
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,360
That I have...

877
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,200
Oh my god!

878
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,900
Bro, okay!

879
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,400
Remember what I did for you!

880
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,100
Remember what I did for you!

881
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,220
We lose this game because I did that?

882
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,040
I'll be so sad.

883
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,840
Literally got fucking saved.

884
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,360
God, he needs to be babysit.

885
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,740
He needs to be babysat.

886
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,500
I was like, kill the streamer!

887
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,880
Oh my god, there we go.

888
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,480
We're fine.

889
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,360
By the way, if you use the code DokiBird...

890
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,440
You get 10% on gamer subs.

891
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,440
You get 10% off.

892
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,840
And I've been on...

893
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,560
I've been on some fucking gamer subs.

894
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,660
I've been on a gamer subs grind.

895
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,860
You're gonna be okay.

896
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,820
You're gonna...

897
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:15,880
Oh!

898
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,120
You know what?

899
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,980
It was the effort.

900
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,960
Nice.

901
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
Gonna keep him up first.

902
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,680
Alright!

903
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,400
You think they just notice I'm here?

904
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,620
I like...

905
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,680
Oh no, they notice now!

906
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,260
I like, I was in the backline for so long!

907
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,100
I was in the backline!

908
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,260
It's fine.

909
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,680
I was just like, oh man.

910
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,160
I fucked up because I decided to not be on the backline.

911
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,380
I decided to jump down from high ground.

912
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,720
I've been on gamer subs this entire Marvel Rivals grind.

913
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,420
Just to like, lock in and stay awake.

914
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,140
That's why I've been like, able to function.

915
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,720
Back to back.

916
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,620
Literally the only reason I'm able to function right now.

917
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,520
Back to back.

918
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,440
Sorry.

919
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,200
I shouldn't laugh at that.

920
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,080
It's like, we need to win this game.

921
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,980
That was funny though.

922
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,340
Gotta admit.

923
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,620
That was pretty funny.

924
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,080
Well, I just drink one...

925
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,900
I just drink one cup of gamer subs.

926
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,140
In the morning.

927
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,340
That's really it.

928
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,440
It's not like I chug it down.

929
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,440
I just drink like, one cup.

930
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,000
And then like, for the entire stream.

931
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,160
And then like, that's how I fu- Like that- Like I just wake up and then get some water.

932
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,720
And then later on, get some...

933
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,980
Jesus Chri- The wall!

934
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,460
I can't save that!

935
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,660
Like, I would love to be able to save you from that.

936
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,760
But like, that was just way too much damage.

937
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,480
That was too much damage!

938
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,700
Yeah, I use my cups.

939
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,200
Oh...

940
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,100
He's down there.

941
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,540
So we should be fine.

942
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Okay, he died.

943
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,480
He died.

944
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,620
I thought I would be fine, but then...

945
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,640
And I'm not being fine.

946
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,180
Jesus Christ.

947
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
I think we only have one fight left.

948
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,660
They're actually doing so much just to...

949
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,740
Just to kill us.

950
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,860
Oh, one archer boy.

951
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,350
Okay, I'm on point now too.

952
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,570
Both supports are on point.

953
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:49,530
Alright.

954
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,750
We have no supports though, so that's bad.

955
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,290
Oh my god, get on point.

956
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,090
Get on point.

957
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,210
Get on point, please.

958
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,350
We're coming back.

959
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,630
The supports are coming in!

960
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,270
Oh no.

961
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,190
No, get on point, Captain America.

962
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:07,850
Get on point.

963
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,630
We can save you if you get on point.

964
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,190
Just...

965
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:12,850
No!

966
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,070
That was so close.

967
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,420
That was so close.

968
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,440
It's fine.

969
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,340
It's okay.

970
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,100
This game will be different, guys.

971
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,540
This will be a different game.

972
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,180
Oh my god, we had to...

973
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,900
The thing that sucks is that we had to touch the point.

974
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,060
The supports had to.

975
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,340
Because we were the closest, so there was nothing we could do.

976
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,370
I feel like I could've waited a second longer, but I was worried about...

977
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,050
I don't know the overtime ticker.

978
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,690
I don't know how fast the overtime ticker goes.

979
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,150
Like, I don't know.

980
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,610
I don't know how fast I didn't want to take the risk.

981
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,090
I'm locked in.

982
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,960
I'm so fucking locked in.

983
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,040
I was trying to figure out...

984
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,850
Healers.

985
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,910
Good luck.

986
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,250
Good luck, buddy.

987
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,210
We're all okay, right?

988
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,130
Okay.

989
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,130
Alright.

990
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,950
Dancing!

991
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,230
I love to dance!

992
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,050
Jesus Christ.

993
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,330
Oh my god, he's solo too.

994
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:05,870
That's unlucky.

995
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,520
Fuck you, you stupid ninja.

996
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,760
You think you're better than me?

997
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,780
Grab it on the other support.

998
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,260
Okay.

999
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,680
I feel like I should put it on Captain America right now.

1000
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,960
Until... Okay, nevermind.

1001
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,580
Now he's here.

1002
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,620
Because like, Traverse is gonna die non-stop.

1003
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,410
You're so healthy.

1004
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,930
You're so healthy.

1005
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,040
Oh, we did not...

1006
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,280
We gotta get the Bruce Banner.

1007
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,580
Nice, we got him.

1008
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,740
Oh my god.

1009
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,380
Oh my god, Captain!

1010
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,340
You're crazy!

1011
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,600
Captain America!

1012
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,620
Oh, fucking he's dead.

1013
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,700
Oh, he's so dead.

1014
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,740
He's so fucking dead.

1015
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,420
I think he's gonna come down from here, right?

1016
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,740
He hulked out.

1017
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,520
Okay, so I'll heal him.

1018
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:27,950
You're fine.

1019
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,810
You're fine, you're so fine.

1020
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,490
You're so fine.

1021
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,650
I don't feel fine no more.

1022
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,730
I feel fine again.

1023
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,610
I am so healthy.

1024
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,530
We're dancing!

1025
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,890
Cause we're dancing!

1026
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,950
Dance your pain away!

1027
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:55,110
You'll eventually get top 500 Toki if you just keep dancing!

1028
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,490
Oh my god.

1029
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,830
Yeah, why would fucking Captain America just punch?

1030
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,150
Just throw your shield.

1031
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,670
Throwing your shield should not be a fucking cooldown.

1032
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,290
Just fucking throw it.

1033
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,330
Like, does his arm get fucking tired?

1034
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:33,110
Like, what's wrong with his arm?

1035
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,850
You're a fucking super soldier.

1036
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,910
What's wrong with you?

1037
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,550
He's all Doki.

1038
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,090
He's like 90.

1039
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:53,010
Being 90 does not mean you can't stop knowing how to throw a fucking shield.

1040
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,110
You're literally Captain America.

1041
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,090
Yeah, and what did he do in those wards?

1042
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,670
He fucking threw his shield.

1043
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,930
What was it?

1044
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,610
Oh wait, you're right.

1045
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,190
Isn't like Wolverine like technically 120?

1046
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:24,350
Yeah, if Wolverine can fucking- Oh my god.

1047
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:24,910
Why?

1048
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:28,270
Okay.

1049
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,410
That's fucked.

1050
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,290
Yeah, I don't think we won the first fight.

1051
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:40,570
They literally engage with- They engage with that.

1052
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,600
Yeah, but Captain America has super soldier serum.

1053
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,620
It's almost the same thing.

1054
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,440
This is very risky, but I trust the hella to not be able to kill me.

1055
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,080
That's the only reason why I'm like looking- peeking it.

1056
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,980
I'm like, there's no way.

1057
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,440
Oh my god.

1058
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,260
Oh, I know.

1059
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,060
Don't kill me after I said that.

1060
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,980
Don't kill me after I said I trust on you to not be able to kill me.

1061
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,040
That would be so embarrassing.

1062
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,140
Oh my god, she almost killed me.

1063
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,840
She actually almost killed me.

1064
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,520
Oh please, Captain America.

1065
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,720
You're making me very nervous right now.

1066
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,320
Stand in a line.

1067
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,680
Oh my god, stand in a fucking line.

1068
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,420
Oh, Mr. America.

1069
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,140
Mr. America.

1070
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,220
Oh, Mr. America.

1071
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,140
Oh, Mr. America.

1072
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,880
Please, please.

1073
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,240
Please.

1074
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:11,960
Just stand.

1075
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,420
Just stand in here.

1076
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,160
Just stand in here.

1077
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,320
It's fine.

1078
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,920
Oh, we didn't kill Bruce Banner though.

1079
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,910
Oh my god.

1080
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,000
There's too many things on my screen.

1081
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,140
Oh my god, Captain America, please just die on point.

1082
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,280
Captain America, no!

1083
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,450
Live!

1084
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,790
And that's how you play a healer.

1085
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,050
Oh, this is scary.

1086
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:13,590
Get away.

1087
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,930
Get away.

1088
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:17,570
Get away.

1089
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,150
Literally, I have to babysit him so he'd fucking live.

1090
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,570
Everybody wants to fucking kill him.

1091
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:32,370
I feel like we have to put so many resources on him.

1092
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,590
There were three people on him.

1093
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,680
I did not care about anybody else.

1094
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,100
There was the fucking entire country on him.

1095
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,460
That's actually crazy.

1096
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,840
Like, he's gonna jump.

1097
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,260
Watch this.

1098
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,640
He's gonna jump on him.

1099
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,200
Oh, shit.

1100
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,480
Oh my god, he didn't jump on him.

1101
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,940
He didn't jump on him this time.

1102
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,480
For once.

1103
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,880
For once he just jumped on Rocket Raccoon, thank fucking god.

1104
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,060
Come on.

1105
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,880
Okay, there you go.

1106
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,620
Come on, guys.

1107
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,160
Maybe you guys can kill something.

1108
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,300
Nice.

1109
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,640
Nice, we did it!

1110
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,220
That's how it feels.

1111
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,680
That's how it feels.

1112
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,920
Like being a healer.

1113
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,760
Oh my god.

1114
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,040
We did it.

1115
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,120
Oh, we fucking did it.

1116
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,740
Jesus Christ.

1117
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,000
I literally saw four people just trying to beat him up.

1118
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,120
Oh my god.

1119
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,260
Three games, chat.

1120
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,240
Three fucking games.

1121
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,220
Three fucking games.

1122
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,140
Three more.

1123
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,360
And then...

1124
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,660
Three more.

1125
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,900
Oh, is he diamond?

1126
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,900
He must be diamond now, right?

1127
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,540
Oh, now they're just gonna ban Hawkeye.

1128
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,140
I don't know what the fuck he's gonna...

1129
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,060
They're gonna ban Hawkeye now.

1130
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,080
Three games away.

1131
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,480
Just three, right?

1132
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,520
Just three?

1133
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,540
And only three.

1134
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,360
No more...

1135
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,860
Won't have to worry.

1136
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,900
It's just three.

1137
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,720
Oh, please.

1138
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,680
Please just be...

1139
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,040
Oh, wait.

1140
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,000
Somebody's plat.

1141
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,100
There's no hero bans.

1142
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,180
Oh my god, thank god.

1143
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,740
Another day without a hero ban.

1144
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,960
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1145
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:14,700
I'll be right back.

1146
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,680
Okay.

1147
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,040
I'm ready.

1148
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,180
I'm so ready.

1149
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,120
Three more.

1150
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,280
Three more games.

1151
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,060
What's the worst that could happen?

1152
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,660
I say as we start losing.

1153
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:25,540
Alright,

1154
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:28,980
here we go.

1155
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,700
Guys, just because I'm not sponsored and Surefire is sponsored, don't buy the battle.

1156
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,660
Surefire told you guys to buy the battle.

1157
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,920
Don't buy the battle until I'm sponsored.

1158
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,480
Oh my god.

1159
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,860
That's scary.

1160
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,540
He just died.

1161
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,420
Just like that.

1162
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,620
I'm learning how to play cover now.

1163
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:18,310
What's lucky is that the tank's also taking damage, so I don't have to worry about healing him when he's doing that fucking shit.

1164
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:22,490
So like, he gets all these heals.

1165
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:29,310
I'm making sure that he's also being healed enough.

1166
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:34,750
Please, please, please be okay guys.

1167
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:42,710
I froze him, but he's coming back to life, that fucking bitch.

1168
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,710
I know where he is, because there's no way he moved.

1169
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,130
Oh my god.

1170
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,790
I need to play cover more now.

1171
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:55,970
No!

1172
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,110
Just stand here and just start dancing!

1173
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:11,910
Just, just start dancing!

1174
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:12,170
Just start dancing!

1175
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:21,490
Alright, so, they have like a million other ults to be worried about.

1176
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,190
Oh, that's our portal.

1177
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,310
Oh my god, no!

1178
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,830
It freaked out!

1179
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:35,250
I saw that and I freaked out because I was like, what the fuck is that doing there?

1180
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,560
Oh shit, oh.

1181
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,420
Fine, I'll just win it.

1182
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,620
Oh my god, again!

1183
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,320
Again!

1184
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,360
Nice.

1185
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,200
Oh my god, our Bucky popped the fuck off.

1186
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,220
Alright, sorry Tier 4, I'm going to give it to Bucky now.

1187
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,780
Alright.

1188
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,720
Sorry.

1189
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,160
Sorry, he deserves this more.

1190
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,820
He coked.

1191
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,100
The fuck you carry?

1192
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,980
Sorry dude.

1193
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:44,300
Only good little aces get the little, get the fucking heal orb.

1194
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,660
He did, he did okay.

1195
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:58,640
He did his job, but the Bucky, he like, he did his job and then he, and then he worked overtime.

1196
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,480
The Bucky stayed for overtime.

1197
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,760
Sure, if we're clocked in and clocked out.

1198
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,020
What?

1199
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,800
Oh my god, it's like a little fucking ramp.

1200
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,000
It's like a race car.

1201
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,160
He's employee of the month.

1202
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,900
Yeah, the Bucky's employee of the month.

1203
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,480
You gotta reward the employee of the month.

1204
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,960
Yeah, he did three overtime, which is my favorite too.

1205
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,980
Oh, hello time.

1206
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,480
Oh, what?

1207
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,340
He actually went for me?

1208
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,500
What is our Doctor Strange blocking?

1209
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,620
You would think he'd block for me.

1210
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,480
Like, where was he blocking?

1211
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,640
I was so confused.

1212
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,800
Oh, goodbye Groot.

1213
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,380
Oh, he's so dead.

1214
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,380
Like, I don't know where the fuck he is.

1215
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:08,580
Alright.

1216
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,120
They had ult advantage there, but they used one ult?

1217
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,680
Two ults?

1218
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,060
I don't even know how many ults they used.

1219
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,610
Alright, I'll give it back to him.

1220
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,730
Maybe he'll start performing better.

1221
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:31,210
I did not mean that to be...

1222
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,310
Sorry, I meant like, you know what I mean.

1223
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,010
Sorry, Marble Rivals makes me a really fucked up person.

1224
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,230
I'm sorry.

1225
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,470
I'm sorry.

1226
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,310
Are you serious?

1227
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,850
I instant died?

1228
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:57,890
Oh my god, I couldn't even press Q when he did that.

1229
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,650
I couldn't even press Q!

1230
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,450
I just like, instantly died.

1231
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,980
Alright, nevermind.

1232
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,260
I'll put it back on him.

1233
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,860
I'm a little worried though, because they do have a Hawkeye too.

1234
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,100
So I'm trying not to...

1235
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,020
We're in this way?

1236
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,400
Okay.

1237
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,020
Alright, Groot.

1238
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:33,390
I'm Groot.

1239
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,410
I can't see anything.

1240
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,750
There's just trees everywhere.

1241
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,590
There's literally just trees everywhere.

1242
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:44,810
Where do I look at?

1243
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,230
Oh, he's one.

1244
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:55,090
They built an entire apartment down here?

1245
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,070
Dude, the Groot maze.

1246
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:03,390
There was like five, like six different walls from both sides, Groots.

1247
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,680
I am Groot.

1248
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,660
I am Groot.

1249
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,420
I am Groot.

1250
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,980
I am Groot.

1251
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,860
Alright, now I've learned.

1252
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,360
Okay.

1253
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,680
Nice.

1254
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:53,940
No!

1255
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,860
There's a Hanzo right there!

1256
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,380
There's a Hanzo!

1257
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,420
I like how they made a fucking ramp just to kill him.

1258
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,120
I'm heading over.

1259
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,700
I'm fucking running.

1260
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,360
I'm running.

1261
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,320
Okay.

1262
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,680
Gotta make sure the orb's on him.

1263
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,480
Oh my god.

1264
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,960
I think he's...

1265
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,480
Oh my god, how do you save him?

1266
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,840
There was no saving him.

1267
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:42,500
He got walled off by our own Groot that couldn't even heal him.

1268
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,280
Our own Groot walled him off on the other side.

1269
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,360
Did you guys see that?

1270
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:52,940
Alright.

1271
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,100
No point.

1272
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,520
I can't touch it.

1273
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,980
He got left behind.

1274
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,820
Okay, he's gonna go penny.

1275
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,100
Yeah, that's a better idea.

1276
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,820
At least we don't have to worry about him getting walled off.

1277
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:27,650
Yeah, he wasn't able to do anything this time.

1278
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:32,050
The Bucky, cause the... I don't know, me having an orb on the...

1279
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:36,790
The Bucky would help him survive getting dived.

1280
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,130
I don't think he's getting dived at all.

1281
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:41,730
Honestly.

1282
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:46,590
I think his positioning is so hard for the healers to heal him though.

1283
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:56,770
So I don't know, cause I have to choose between him or Turf War, but they both position themselves so weird from the healers.

1284
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:59,290
Unless I play high ground with them.

1285
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,110
I might have to play with one of them.

1286
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,270
I don't know.

1287
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,710
I need to figure out how to position myself, I guess.

1288
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:23,530
I hate this.

1289
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,330
I hate all these fucking trees.

1290
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,950
And then not to worry about the building blocking me.

1291
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,640
Guys, guys, trees are blocking.

1292
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:45,580
Okay.

1293
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,420
Whoa, whoa, that group blocked the wall.

1294
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,740
That group wall fucking saved him.

1295
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:55,900
Okay, nice.

1296
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,140
Alright.

1297
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,780
It's fine.

1298
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,840
It's fine.

1299
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,020
I'm just gonna stand here.

1300
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:19,580
Yeah, this side, this doesn't have an angle with the Anzu.

1301
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,620
What?!

1302
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,980
I pressed Q!

1303
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,020
Wait, I got stunned?!

1304
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,420
Oh my god!

1305
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,360
I pressed Q!

1306
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,060
I got stunned!

1307
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:57,400
I instantly hit Q the moment I heard I.

1308
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,840
I heard I.

1309
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,570
Oh, it's not a line?

1310
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,990
Okay, I'll figure it, fix that.

1311
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,230
And yeah, I'll just get rid of it cause I don't think I can fix it.

1312
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:22,470
Okay.

1313
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,510
I'm just gonna do this now.

1314
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,450
I don't know.

1315
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:31,250
Cause I'm like...

1316
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,350
Just hoping we get a kill.

1317
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,750
Oh, stand down.

1318
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,430
Again?

1319
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,240
He's one.

1320
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:51,930
Nice.

1321
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:57,590
Yeah, that's good.

1322
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,330
What?!

1323
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,490
He almost died from that!

1324
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,980
Okay, we heal each other.

1325
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:13,650
Okay.

1326
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,590
I think the only thing I'm worried about is just...

1327
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:23,860
Fucking crazy, that guy was...

1328
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:30,680
Live!

1329
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:33,880
Live!

1330
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:38,970
Yes!

1331
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:43,770
Two more games.

1332
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,770
Two more fucking games.

1333
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,370
Two more!

1334
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,450
Two more fucking games!

1335
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,270
And then we'll be free!

1336
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,620
Oh my god!

1337
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,040
We're almost there!

1338
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:06,980
We're almost there!

1339
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,820
Okay, I can see the... I can see the finish line.

1340
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,220
Oh my god!

1341
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:27,420
Oh, is my... I fucking... I don't... Oh my god, maybe the curse was the aimbot eye all along.

1342
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,960
That was the curse all along.

1343
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,060
Alright, since it's not aligned, I'm too lazy to fix it.

1344
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:48,310
Alright.

1345
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,230
Oh...

1346
01:06:54,230 --> 01:07:00,970
What are we banning, guys?

1347
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:01,970
Hella?

1348
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:04,190
I'm gonna request hella.

1349
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,640
What?

1350
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,880
Who said that?

1351
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,940
Took my RR twice?

1352
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,620
Who said that?

1353
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,440
Yo, he took my... What's RR?

1354
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:46,600
What's RR?

1355
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,360
What does RR mean?

1356
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,400
Oh, rank points?

1357
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:01,010
Alright, well, apparently this guy lost 10 games in a row, so I know who to avoid.

1358
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,370
Like, rank roints?

1359
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,010
Oh my god.

1360
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,090
Oh my god.

1361
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:20,210
Alright, Road Aggie, did I take your rank roints?

1362
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:27,490
No,

1363
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,090
my rank roints.

1364
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,970
Guys, like, what the fuck is RR?

1365
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,650
Is that what they call it in fucking Viral Rivals?

1366
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:43,210
What the fuck else would it stand for?

1367
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,590
Like, what the fuck else would RR stand for?

1368
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,050
My rank roints?

1369
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:52,510
No!

1370
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,510
Rank raiding?

1371
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,990
Bro, what the fuck?

1372
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,550
I'm sorry, Valiant.

1373
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:59,170
That's a dumb thing, rank raiding.

1374
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:09,610
Has he ever played tank?

1375
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,680
I'm just gonna stand here.

1376
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,120
You guys can tell, like, the higher elo you are, the more safe I have to play now.

1377
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,360
Like, I just have to play angles.

1378
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:42,540
I'm not going high ground because I know they have a Hawkeye, but like, I'm not playing angles because of it.

1379
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,480
I got Roll.

1380
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,800
Got my rank roints.

1381
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,720
My position has changed a lot the higher elo I am in.

1382
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,380
Because, like, I know when I'm in the lower elos, I'm like, they can't do jack shit.

1383
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:17,780
You know?

1384
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,400
You're like, I can stand here.

1385
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,880
Like, they can't fucking kill me.

1386
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,440
But I'm like, oh shit, these guys can aim now.

1387
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,160
Yeah.

1388
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,780
These guys can fucking aim.

1389
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,140
I don't want to get randomly Hanzo, like, logged.

1390
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,420
Or Hawkeye logged.

1391
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,480
Yeah.

1392
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,160
Like, one shot?

1393
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,700
I'm like, I'm not getting one shot.

1394
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,960
I'm like, playing here.

1395
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,360
I don't have to be center stage.

1396
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,920
Would you give up arm?

1397
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:58,140
Hey Scooby, would you give up rank roints for a Scooby snack?

1398
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,900
I'm going to start calling it rank roints now.

1399
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,100
No, my rank roints.

1400
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,900
Not my rank roints.

1401
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,300
Okay, that's sad.

1402
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,480
That's sad.

1403
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,720
Okay.

1404
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,140
Nice bullseye, bro.

1405
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,340
I can't see you!

1406
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,580
I can't see you!

1407
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,260
Oh!

1408
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:47,600
No!

1409
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,660
I have to- I have to get out of cover!

1410
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:01,660
I'll be fine.

1411
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,620
I'm just assuming if- oh.

1412
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,540
Is he okay?

1413
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:15,640
Is he okay?

1414
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,020
See?

1415
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,200
He's fine for now.

1416
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:32,020
I didn't want to- I didn't ult there because, like, I felt like there's no reason to.

1417
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,420
Okay, I'm ulting now.

1418
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,760
So we can stabilize this.

1419
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,160
Last fight.

1420
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,340
It is last fight, though.

1421
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,700
I was hoping to get a kill, but they didn't.

1422
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,200
At least I didn't get a kill.

1423
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:07,930
Oh my god.

1424
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,740
We did it!

1425
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,820
That was a good hold.

1426
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,040
That was a really good hold.

1427
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:23,780
At stand.

1428
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,680
Did this guy advertise his fucking TikTok?

1429
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,280
Who did he play?

1430
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,760
This guy advertises his fucking TikTok.

1431
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,640
Oh my god.

1432
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:39,860
Alright, buddy.

1433
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,900
Oh my god, guys.

1434
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,380
I'm gonna get- Oh my god, guys.

1435
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,840
I'm gonna get my rank points.

1436
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:51,580
On my rank points.

1437
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,640
Oh my god.

1438
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,960
This is better than any Scooby snack.

1439
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,380
I gotta respect the hustle.

1440
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,260
Hustle, yeah.

1441
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,820
But on fucking TikTok.

1442
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:08,880
You'd think, you know, you'd think it'd be Twitch, but fucking TikTok.

1443
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,860
I'm getting points for my TikTok.

1444
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,040
My Rickrock.

1445
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,780
Apparently, apparently it means like rank.

1446
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:29,600
What was it?

1447
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,520
I don't even remember the original.

1448
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,220
What was it for Valorant?

1449
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,300
Rank something?

1450
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,080
I don't even know.

1451
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,780
I just know rank points.

1452
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,000
Rank rating.

1453
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:43,320
Oh yeah.

1454
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,620
See, it doesn't even roll off your tongue.

1455
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,560
That's the thing.

1456
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:57,280
It doesn't fucking roll off your tongue, so it's like- That's why I think it's a dumb way to say your competitive rank.

1457
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:06,900
This is good for- I think- Oh my god.

1458
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,600
She's so good for defense, though.

1459
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,440
It's actually so annoying.

1460
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,790
This is annoying for defense.

1461
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,540
There's so much healing.

1462
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,780
I think this positioning is good.

1463
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,220
So I don't have to worry about the Hawkeye.

1464
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:34,960
Now we have Hawkeye and Widow?

1465
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,740
Okay, buddy.

1466
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:50,030
We have double Sniper, but I don't know if double Sniper is supposed to be good.

1467
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:56,510
Yeah, I'll do it after.

1468
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:58,790
No!

1469
01:15:59,230 --> 01:15:59,830
I landed it!

1470
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,760
Rocket, please!

1471
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,380
Just hit me once!

1472
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,300
I didn't have my shift.

1473
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,500
I already used it.

1474
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:19,260
That's why I didn't- I couldn't heal myself.

1475
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:41,740
I don't want to use it aggressively because- I don't want to use my ult aggressively because they have too many- There's too many stuff to worry about.

1476
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,700
Use this so I can heal them after the Megiddo.

1477
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:54,560
The

1478
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:00,810
fuck?

1479
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:01,650
How did he die so fast?

1480
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,460
It's fine.

1481
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:12,530
Yay!

1482
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,040
Yay!

1483
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,580
Got my Rain Coins.

1484
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,620
Let's go!

1485
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,360
Oh my god.

1486
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,320
Is that it?

1487
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,730
Oh my- Is this it?

1488
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,410
I need- Oh my god.

1489
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:37,950
23.

1490
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,070
One more game.

1491
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,310
One more game, guys.

1492
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:43,830
One more game.

1493
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:45,970
Just need one more.

1494
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:53,230
Also, like, I realized, like, 3 seconds in I was on damage.

1495
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:57,810
Because, like, sometimes when I press Q, I spam Q so it goes to damage.

1496
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:01,630
I need that UI to be bigger.

1497
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:11,470
Like, it's so hard to, like- That UI is so, like, hard to know when you're on damage or heal instantly.

1498
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:13,650
Because, like, it looks so similar.

1499
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:15,950
It looks so fucking similar.

1500
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:16,530
Similar!

1501
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:21,230
Yeah, but it's just a little bigger.

1502
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:24,750
It's literally just a little tiny bigger.

1503
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,990
So, I'm like- I need it to, like- I need it to be more similar.

1504
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:36,890
Oh my god.

1505
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:38,830
Oh, wait.

1506
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:39,910
Is this a plat lobby?

1507
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,910
I think it's a plat lobby because...

1508
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:45,990
We can just pick.

1509
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:53,830
There are different colors, but it just- When you're on damage, it goes up a little bit.

1510
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,030
That's the thing.

1511
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:59,030
So, it's so similar in general.

1512
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:05,850
Like, so, like- Because you see both of them.

1513
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,630
I feel like- Just cancel out the other one.

1514
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:13,410
So you don't see the audio thing for the damage, I feel like.

1515
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:18,590
I feel like as long as you don't see the audio thing for the damage, then it'll be fine.

1516
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:27,450
I just don't like the fact that it looks too- Like, it's just- My mind doesn't instantly- Also, I don't know.

1517
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:30,170
Maybe it's because, like, I still need more hours to get used to it.

1518
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:34,990
But, like, I'm not used to, like, just clicking.

1519
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,750
I'm not- I just need it to look more different.

1520
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,650
Because I instantly think I'm on heal.

1521
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,040
Alright, one game.

1522
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,600
One more game.

1523
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,420
Oh my god, it's Magneto time.

1524
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,400
Alright, this is the game.

1525
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,020
Why are you standing here for your portal?

1526
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,200
You could've stood anywhere else!

1527
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:13,920
Else!

1528
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,940
That's good that they're just looking at him.

1529
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,880
Literally me healing him is healing Surefour, so that's fine.

1530
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,800
Like, I'll take that.

1531
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,870
Like, him feeding lets me heal Surefour, so that's fine.

1532
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,430
What?

1533
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:55,050
Like, why the fuck did he stand in front of the Punisher?

1534
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:58,550
No.

1535
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,810
Like, there they come!

1536
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:20,920
No again?

1537
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:28,300
Maybe you can do something from this.

1538
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,480
Push.

1539
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,340
We're up.

1540
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,720
Jesus Christ.

1541
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,720
I have to put so much resource on this guy.

1542
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,220
Please kill him!

1543
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:48,300
Holy fuck.

1544
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:52,460
Alright,

1545
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,430
don't worry, I can keep both tanks up.

1546
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:04,690
That's fine.

1547
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,330
I'm fine with that.

1548
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:11,750
I can keep both the tanks up.

1549
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,630
I'm okay with that.

1550
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:17,770
Um, give me a sec.

1551
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:18,910
I can do both tanks.

1552
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,090
I can still keep both tanks up.

1553
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:23,730
That's fine.

1554
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:34,850
Jesus Christ, I can't keep- No!

1555
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,350
Goodbye, everybody.

1556
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:41,730
That's so much damage!

1557
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:48,430
That was so much damage, holy shit!

1558
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,790
They died so fast!

1559
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,010
Fuck, I got you.

1560
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,890
You guys have got lots of guns.

1561
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,330
Yeah, but I meant, like, our team in general.

1562
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:07,030
Like, they died so fast, even with the ult.

1563
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:15,820
Stand in a line.

1564
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,820
Stand in a line so I can heal like this.

1565
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,240
Stand in a line so I can heal like this.

1566
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,580
Hahaha.

1567
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:27,060
Stand in a line.

1568
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,200
Jesus Christ.

1569
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:40,860
Alright.

1570
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,820
Thank God they stood in line.

1571
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,860
Thank God.

1572
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,560
Stand in a line!

1573
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:56,430
Oh.

1574
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,110
I ain't coming for you.

1575
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:06,530
Okay.

1576
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:09,510
We'll put on the Helidon.

1577
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,110
Since we don't have our other tank right now.

1578
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:13,810
I ult.

1579
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:17,050
Okay.

1580
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:20,750
Nice.

1581
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,010
Get the fucking- Get the Soldier!

1582
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,920
Oh my God.

1583
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:31,380
Alright.

1584
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:34,840
Bye.

1585
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,200
Oh!

1586
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:42,970
Whoa!

1587
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:43,910
I ult, though.

1588
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,990
That's good.

1589
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:48,790
Bye.

1590
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:50,830
We're so healthy.

1591
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,730
Okay.

1592
01:24:58,410 --> 01:24:59,870
Are we- Are we okay?

1593
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:03,170
Whoa!

1594
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:04,070
Whoa!

1595
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:16,340
Oh my God, everybody lived, but, like, will we keep living, though?

1596
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,060
Oh shit.

1597
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:22,980
Okay.

1598
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:26,600
That's fine.

1599
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:27,040
That's fine.

1600
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:27,600
That's fine.

1601
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,300
That's fine.

1602
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,640
We got- We got Hella ult.

1603
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:31,980
Beat him up!

1604
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:32,360
Beat him up!

1605
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:32,780
Beat him up!

1606
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,240
Beat him up!

1607
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:35,060
Oh!

1608
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:38,340
That's a good push.

1609
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,480
That was a good push.

1610
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,380
Our Hella was really good.

1611
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,000
Thank God.

1612
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,720
Thank you to the NRE team for bringing a plat player into this lobby.

1613
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,060
Thank you.

1614
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:54,040
Shoutout to that guy for bringing that plat player.

1615
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,660
Shoutout to him.

1616
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,310
No bans.

1617
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:03,910
No bans.

1618
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:15,450
I hope we- I hope we win so I can take back the- the rank warrants I gave to Temp.

1619
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:20,070
I restart his Loose Streak.

1620
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:23,370
I wanna restart his Lost Streak.

1621
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:27,410
And he's like, like, I'm on a 10k Lost Streak, guys.

1622
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:28,630
I ain't comming no more.

1623
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,050
I wanna be his Gatsby.

1624
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,490
Is that fucked?

1625
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:42,150
Is that fucked up?

1626
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:48,270
Necessary toxicity.

1627
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:53,710
Actually evil.

1628
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:57,490
Yeah, I'm Diamond 3.

1629
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:02,250
The cycle of toxicity.

1630
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:11,190
He thought that he broke his Lost Streak, but no, I'm just starting a new line.

1631
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:13,830
Like, the new avatar line.

1632
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,510
I'm restarting- I'm starting a new one.

1633
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:22,890
Oh my God, I'm fucking- I'm fucking- I'm sorry.

1634
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:25,830
I have to look- I have to look this way.

1635
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,340
Our tank is not doing so well.

1636
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,260
Oh no.

1637
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,480
Makina, no.

1638
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:57,200
I don't think we're gonna touch that.

1639
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,220
No!

1640
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,720
That was a really good portal.

1641
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:11,260
Because, like, we were- we had to go a different direction.

1642
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,620
That was a really good portal from them.

1643
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,300
Because I didn't- I wasn't able to drop down.

1644
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,220
Oh no, we're staggered.

1645
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:18,480
No.

1646
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,100
No, I- that's karma.

1647
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,600
I'm so sorry I didn't mean that.

1648
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,400
I'm sorry.

1649
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,460
I don't want to get karma'd.

1650
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,240
I'm so sorry.

1651
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:36,530
No, he lives?

1652
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,830
He actually lives that?

1653
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:44,030
Oh no, guys.

1654
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,930
No, I don't want to get karma'd, guys.

1655
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:57,170
I am Groot.

1656
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:58,370
I am Groot.

1657
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:00,390
He is Groot.

1658
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,690
He is Groot.

1659
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:09,150
I am Groot.

1660
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:11,530
Yay!

1661
01:29:15,190 --> 01:29:16,030
Yay!

1662
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:18,830
Alright.

1663
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:22,970
Alright, we used both support ults, so- oopsie.

1664
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:25,110
I am Groot.

1665
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,120
Alright.

1666
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,300
We accidentally used both support ults, so...

1667
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,380
What do we do?

1668
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,660
Because they have- they have their Dr. Sh- Yeah, and they have this.

1669
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:47,740
And they had this.

1670
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,300
And they had this!

1671
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:51,500
There.

1672
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,180
I'm not going to live!

1673
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,360
Thank you!

1674
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,560
Thank you!

1675
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,020
It's alright, fine.

1676
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:09,680
Move up, move up.

1677
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:13,460
I am Groot.

1678
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,500
He's Brooding.

1679
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,160
He's WE ARE GROOT!

1680
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:24,720
Okay.

1681
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,620
Okay.

1682
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,620
Oh my god.

1683
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:33,620
Okay.

1684
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:37,160
I'm not- we're going to have Rocket Raccoon ult before my ult.

1685
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:46,680
Alright.

1686
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:48,840
We are Groot.

1687
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,440
Nice.

1688
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,280
Oh, I'm so locked in.

1689
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,900
I'm so fucking locked in.

1690
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:03,820
What?!

1691
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,300
He died so fast!

1692
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:16,200
Nice.

1693
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:18,640
We're pushing!

1694
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,200
I'm skating!

1695
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,480
Skate!

1696
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:27,180
He's one, he's one, he's actually one!

1697
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,100
Nice!

1698
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,240
We got him.

1699
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:36,080
Alright.

1700
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,560
Oh...

1701
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,660
Two more fights, two more fights guys!

1702
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,080
Two more fights!

1703
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,080
I'm locked.

1704
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,260
I am Groot.

1705
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,340
I don't like staying up here.

1706
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,520
Like, I don't know!

1707
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,000
I feel like, oh no.

1708
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,960
I'm Brooding.

1709
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,660
Go, go, go!

1710
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,060
Go!

1711
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:19,240
Okay.

1712
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:20,540
Nice.

1713
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,040
Alright, they have...

1714
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,180
Okay, they used Strange ult.

1715
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,120
They're going to have Bucky ult.

1716
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:24,920
They're going to have Bucky ult.

1717
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,640
They're going to have Hawkeye ult.

1718
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:28,240
They're going to have...

1719
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,480
Oh, they're going to have all their DPS ult.

1720
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:31,780
Alright, good luck everybody.

1721
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,020
I'm going to stand back here.

1722
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,160
Yes, guys.

1723
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:40,440
But remember how many DPSs they have there?

1724
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:43,280
And they used a tank ult, guys.

1725
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,760
That's...

1726
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,700
Goodbye, Groot.

1727
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,640
Goodbye, Groot.

1728
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:48,840
Groot.

1729
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:59,700
That's your rez.

1730
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,540
That's where your rez went.

1731
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:01,880
Not right here!

1732
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:09,870
Oh my god.

1733
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,190
Yes.

1734
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:16,690
Oh no!

1735
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:19,320
I killed...

1736
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,620
Oh wait, I got the rez.

1737
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,680
Let's go.

1738
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:27,690
Oh, they're boring again too.

1739
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,190
No.

1740
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:32,990
Not the arc.

1741
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:39,000
I might get ults from here.

1742
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,540
No again!

1743
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,420
That's right!

1744
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:46,920
Whoa!

1745
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:47,360
Okay.

1746
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,400
That scared me though.

1747
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:52,520
Wait.

1748
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:53,360
Is this it?

1749
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:54,600
Oh my god.

1750
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:56,100
Oh my god!

1751
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,520
Beat him up!

1752
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,280
Beat him up!

1753
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,760
I'm going to fucking start fissing!

1754
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:00,920
No!

1755
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:01,760
No!

1756
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,220
I'm going to start...

1757
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:09,400
Wait.

1758
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,220
We're sure for...

1759
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:12,920
Oh no.

1760
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,260
We're sure for...

1761
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,300
I need to be like...

1762
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:17,800
Sure for...

1763
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,440
Don't Q!

1764
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,920
Don't Q!

1765
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,980
I can't swap the sure for!

1766
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,140
Don't Q!

1767
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,720
I think...

1768
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,580
Don't Q!

1769
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,420
Yeah!

1770
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,460
Diamond 2!

1771
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,040
Yeah!

1772
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,240
Screenshot!

1773
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:40,940
Screenshot!

1774
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,660
Oh my god!

1775
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,020
Nice!

1776
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:46,380
Oh my god.

1777
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,120
Don't Q.

1778
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,120
Don't Q.

1779
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:49,500
Don't fucking Q.

1780
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,680
Don't Q.

1781
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:53,360
I can't message him to say, Don't Q!

1782
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:53,840
Yeah!

1783
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,360
Don't Q!

1784
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,580
Give me a sec!

1785
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,020
Oh my god.

1786
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:04,680
Wait.

1787
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,440
Is that it?

1788
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:08,520
How do I check?

1789
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:10,940
47!

1790
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,720
No!

1791
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,000
I need one more!

1792
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:16,620
I need one more.

1793
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,140
I need two more!

1794
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:18,600
I need...

1795
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:18,940
What is it?

1796
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,120
I need...

1797
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,260
Two...

1798
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,400
One more win.

1799
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:25,480
No!

1800
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,680
Oh my god.

1801
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:33,900
We're so close.

1802
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,780
Is it 47?

1803
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,940
As in like 47 points?

1804
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,080
Or I'm...

1805
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,140
I'm...

1806
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:42,500
Or...

1807
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,240
Am I like...

1808
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,480
547 plays?

1809
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,100
547 plays?

1810
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:49,080
Or...

1811
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,140
Or...

1812
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:51,260
Do I need...

1813
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:51,900
Is it...

1814
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,120
Is it 47 players?

1815
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,820
Or do I need 47 points?

1816
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:01,920
547?

1817
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:02,620
Okay.

1818
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,360
So it's one game.

1819
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,220
It's one game.

1820
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:04,900
Okay.

1821
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:05,580
Okay.

1822
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,780
This next game.

1823
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:07,220
Okay.

1824
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:08,140
Okay.

1825
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:08,720
I'm ready.

1826
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,440
47 people...

1827
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,240
47 games.

1828
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,400
Oh my god.

1829
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:21,360
Oh my god!

1830
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,880
Just one more.

1831
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,420
Oh my god.

1832
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:34,480
Just one more.

1833
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,280
One more win.

1834
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,600
Oh my god.

1835
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:40,220
One more win.

1836
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:43,160
And then I'll be okay.

1837
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,260
I'll be okay.

1838
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,980
Oh my god.

1839
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,440
I just need...

1840
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,600
Oh my god.

1841
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:52,940
We're...

1842
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:54,840
Please.

1843
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,440
We're so close.

1844
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,780
We're so fucking close.

1845
01:36:58,940 --> 01:36:59,380
I hope...

1846
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,660
I wanna win so I can win with 69 wins.

1847
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,280
I just...

1848
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:06,780
I wanna win with 69 wins.

1849
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,060
Oh my god.

1850
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:10,380
Please.

1851
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:15,790
Please, RNG.

1852
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:16,950
Guys, we gotta pray.

1853
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,610
Guys, we gotta pray.

1854
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:23,850
No, if we do comms, we're not gonna focus.

1855
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,090
We do not...

1856
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:30,550
When we both get in voice together, we do not lock in.

1857
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:35,090
We 100% do not lock in.

1858
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:43,190
Comms is actually like...

1859
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,330
A deep puff for us.

1860
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,430
Oh my god.

1861
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:49,170
Guys, give us your...

1862
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:51,250
Pray and give us energy, guys.

1863
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,450
We're so close.

1864
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,450
We're so close.

1865
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:58,890
We're almost there.

1866
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:01,230
What the fuck?

1867
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:02,450
Thanos Wang?

1868
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:04,750
That's a good name.

1869
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:06,910
Oh my god.

1870
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,950
I hope we're lucky, guys.

1871
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:11,330
I hope we're lucky.

1872
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:13,930
I hope we can be lucky.

1873
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,750
We just need to be lucky.

1874
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:19,770
I'm nervous.

1875
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:20,950
I'm so nervous.

1876
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:27,090
I'm so nervous.

1877
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:29,370
There's no plat players in here.

1878
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:31,070
There's a grandmaster?!

1879
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:37,920
Bro, why does he have a master?!

1880
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:46,300
Oh my god.

1881
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:51,580
A grandmaster blocks my path.

1882
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,580
Oh my god, they have clone man too.

1883
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,580
Who's a tank player.

1884
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,640
I have Phreak's and...

1885
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:57,840
Is that Muffin?

1886
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:58,820
The tank player?

1887
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,160
Muffin?

1888
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,520
Oh my god.

1889
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,180
I have to...

1890
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:08,680
They're guarding the top 500.

1891
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:12,400
They're guarding it right now.

1892
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,920
That's my raid boss, chat.

1893
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,220
That's my fucking raid boss.

1894
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,660
I think they have...

1895
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:28,940
Pay attention, sorry man.

1896
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,100
Oh my god.

1897
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:34,160
Don't ban Hella, because that character is corny.

1898
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,020
I mean, that's a pretty solid thought, actually.

1899
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:45,560
Spider-man?

1900
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:46,000
What the hell?

1901
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,660
Who the fuck plays Spider-man on our team?

1902
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,020
That's an interesting one.

1903
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,540
Who's the Spider-man player?

1904
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,740
So what are we thinking, guys?

1905
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,960
They have a Star-Lord one trick, I know.

1906
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,740
He's rank 41?!

1907
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:03,820
Oh shit, which one's super?

1908
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:04,680
Oh, is it...

1909
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,160
Oh, is it Raring Garlic?

1910
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:07,520
Is that super?

1911
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:08,700
Okay.

1912
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:10,920
Bro, what the fuck does that...

1913
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,300
Oh my god.

1914
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:19,660
Why do we have the hardest lobby for the top 500?

1915
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,180
What the fuck?

1916
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,440
Do you tank player, or like...

1917
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,260
We have to play against...

1918
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,720
Oh my god.

1919
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,100
Oh my god.

1920
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:35,480
This actually is like...

1921
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:39,400
Of course, my top 500 game has to be like...

1922
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,460
The hardest game.

1923
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:42,780
Oh my god.

1924
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:44,320
Both teams are stacked...

1925
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:46,300
As fuck.

1926
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:48,340
Okay.

1927
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:50,180
Hey, can you hear me?

1928
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:51,820
Yeah, what's up man?

1929
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:52,340
How's it going?

1930
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,800
What's your problem, huh?

1931
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,180
I'm just a little guy, you know?

1932
01:40:58,920 --> 01:40:59,640
It's fine.

1933
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,740
I was just being a chilled guy, but then I got attacked.

1934
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:07,640
Oh my god, this is an overwatch versus overwatch.

1935
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,160
Oh my god.

1936
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:14,440
Thank you, thank you.

1937
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:18,780
Alright, I'm actually on full focus.

1938
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,720
I'm not gonna look at chat, guys, for this game.

1939
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,820
I actually have to pay attention.

1940
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,080
He's good iffy.

1941
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:26,160
I'll bring out the pocket pick Magneto.

1942
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:27,960
I don't want to...

1943
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:29,820
Magneto.

1944
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,360
Dude, my Magneto is insane.

1945
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:53,330
Sidelocked half.

1946
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:54,410
Good hook, good hook.

1947
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,600
I can bubble you here if you want to do it, bro.

1948
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:09,340
Sidelocked.

1949
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,080
Invade.

1950
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,700
Careful, you guys are up.

1951
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,280
We can't help you.

1952
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,140
I think we're fine.

1953
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,120
No, I'm just getting Iron Man in the back, so I gotta heal.

1954
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:22,820
Iron Man's hook is so broken.

1955
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,080
Well, we also banned Elis.

1956
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,080
You know?

1957
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:27,640
Yeah.

1958
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:35,300
Stop him, stop him, stop him.

1959
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,400
Maximum buff!

1960
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:39,100
Nice.

1961
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:43,260
Still got the fucking Hulk on the right.

1962
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:44,940
He's in baby form.

1963
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:49,640
Sidelocked dead.

1964
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,140
Okay.

1965
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:53,480
Iron Man's half.

1966
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:54,400
Why?

1967
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:55,380
Why, Adam?

1968
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:56,860
Oh my god.

1969
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,700
Hulk on the right there.

1970
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,040
Manta's in the back.

1971
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,360
I saw Manta in the back there.

1972
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,820
There's still Hulk, I think.

1973
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,030
Hold on.

1974
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:22,390
We're dead.

1975
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:23,270
Okay.

1976
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:30,310
Oh my god.

1977
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:34,250
No!

1978
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:37,150
No!

1979
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:44,630
Luna, Manta's dead on me.

1980
01:43:46,670 --> 01:43:47,870
Both of you are dead.

1981
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:50,930
I traded with Iron Man.

1982
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:56,350
Oh my god.

1983
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:58,810
Yeah, I used it.

1984
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:01,610
Oh, I don't think so.

1985
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:06,710
Okay.

1986
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:12,570
This is like, I'm super locked in right now.

1987
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:17,550
Maximum punch!

1988
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:18,210
Shit!

1989
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,770
Wow, that's crazy!

1990
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,160
I have to run.

1991
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,120
I'm dead, I'm dead.

1992
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,100
Oh my god.

1993
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:46,500
Oh my god, I think I have to get some voice comms.

1994
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:47,820
To be like, please heal me.

1995
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:49,040
What condition is this?

1996
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:57,100
I have to re-bind my voice comms though, that's the thing.

1997
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,300
I can't do it now.

1998
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,460
Luke's pocketed.

1999
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:24,780
I'm gonna wait.

2000
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,520
Maximum punch!

2001
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:33,920
Oh no!

2002
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:36,780
I wasted it too.

2003
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:40,400
Oh, I didn't think I'd get hit by that.

2004
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:42,680
Fuck!

2005
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:46,560
I didn't think I'd get hit by his ult.

2006
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,100
I didn't think he'd be on me too.

2007
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,640
That sucked.

2008
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:56,360
I didn't think I'd get hit.

2009
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,400
I'm dead.

2010
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,560
I'm walking.

2011
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,500
I'm dead.

2012
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,820
I had to keep the tank up, but I sacrificed my life for it.

2013
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,940
I'm not coming back now.

2014
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,100
It's just, uh, Sylas, Banner, and, uh...

2015
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:39,920
Right there.

2016
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,600
So I'm just living up to what I'm doing.

2017
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:48,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2018
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:52,720
Stabilize.

2019
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,560
I have ult, I have ult, I have ult.

2020
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,500
Yay, I have ult too.

2021
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:57,580
Me and the Brawl?

2022
01:46:57,820 --> 01:46:58,500
I mean...

2023
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:58,700
You don't have it?

2024
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,060
You don't have it?

2025
01:46:59,160 --> 01:46:59,940
You don't have it?

2026
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:00,460
You don't have it?

2027
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,180
You don't have it?

2028
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:07,330
You don't have it?

2029
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:10,190
You don't have it?

2030
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:11,190
I mean...

2031
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:25,230
Oh my god.

2032
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:33,600
Oh my god.

2033
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,660
They all die so fast.

2034
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:46,780
He didn't stun them!

2035
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,620
Oh my god.

2036
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,280
That game was so intense.

2037
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,780
Get ready to shield me.

2038
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:07,380
When we go in, I'm gonna ult.

2039
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:08,220
Okay.

2040
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:09,380
I could fly in with you.

2041
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:09,960
You're gonna fly ult.

2042
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,060
Or I could TP, I could TP.

2043
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:11,880
You wanna do a TP quick?

2044
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:13,820
No, I'm just behind them already.

2045
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:14,800
I'm just gonna fly in and ult.

2046
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:15,680
Get ready to push.

2047
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:21,550
I'm ready, I'm ready.

2048
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:24,890
Nice.

2049
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:29,390
Are we alive?

2050
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:30,510
Shit.

2051
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:36,590
We can't help you.

2052
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:38,030
Tank is about to ult behind us.

2053
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:38,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2054
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:43,350
Okay.

2055
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:46,750
Fly.

2056
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,400
Or fly.

2057
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:10,450
Standing alive, standing alive!

2058
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:11,610
Everybody standing alive!

2059
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:16,460
No way.

2060
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,020
Oh my god.

2061
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:22,120
I wanna stabilize here.

2062
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:29,470
I'm gonna just stabilize.

2063
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:30,610
I'm gonna silence them.

2064
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:31,330
I'm gonna silence them.

2065
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,200
Do you have bubble, Magneto?

2066
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:38,840
Just checking.

2067
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,580
Okay, I'm ready.

2068
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,500
Alright, I have bubble.

2069
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,260
Alright, I'm going up.

2070
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:47,920
Bubble.

2071
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:52,020
Nice!

2072
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:00,470
That's our team up!

2073
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:01,770
That's our team up!

2074
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:06,090
Oh my god.

2075
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:09,350
Okay, I'm gonna rebun.

2076
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:10,710
I'm gonna rebun.

2077
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:12,130
Heal is ticked.

2078
01:50:13,110 --> 01:50:14,850
I mean, Hela's banned.

2079
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:19,190
They have Iron Man and the magic, so...

2080
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:22,610
Yeah, she's pretty good against Iron Man.

2081
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:27,610
Oh my god.

2082
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:29,390
I just have to communicate.

2083
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:32,710
Okay.

2084
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:34,690
Oh!

2085
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:36,950
Ah!

2086
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:41,410
This is a scary game.

2087
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:44,330
Against a Grandmaster, yeah.

2088
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:45,810
We're playing against a Grandmaster.

2089
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:52,340
Oh my god.

2090
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:53,380
This is...

2091
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:56,820
This is actually Raid Boss Hours.

2092
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,220
It's like...

2093
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,560
Oh my god, it's Raid Boss Hours.

2094
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:07,860
Right here.

2095
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:13,540
Of course, this has to be my last game.

2096
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:14,380
This game is like...

2097
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,940
It could be my last game.

2098
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:18,520
Oh my god.

2099
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:20,840
This game is intense.

2100
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,860
This brings me back to Overwatch days.

2101
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,080
Peak Overwatch days in Top 500.

2102
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:27,680
Oh!

2103
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:49,530
Okay.

2104
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:58,730
Okay.

2105
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:01,350
Okay.

2106
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,620
Oh my god!

2107
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:25,720
I'm getting hard fo- I'm sorry.

2108
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,280
That's crazy.

2109
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:33,820
I'm coming back.

2110
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:35,920
I'm skating.

2111
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,780
I'm gonna skate.

2112
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:48,020
I'm putting it on tank.

2113
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:48,860
I'm putting it on tank.

2114
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:52,640
No!

2115
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:00,640
Oh my god, this Ironman is crazy!

2116
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,760
This Ironman is insane!

2117
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:12,160
Holy shit.

2118
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:16,140
Yeah, he's so good on the right with the right person.

2119
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:17,820
It's actually so scary.

2120
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:18,740
I don't know how to play...

2121
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:22,300
I don't know how to play safe when we're attacking.

2122
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:45,340
Wait, is this the best Scarlet Witch NA?

2123
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:46,500
Oh yeah.

2124
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:47,520
Okay.

2125
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,760
I'd be the only one.

2126
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:51,840
Wait, there's Scarlet Witch players in NA?

2127
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:52,860
I'm one out of one.

2128
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:54,380
I'm one out of one.

2129
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:56,060
I'm getting really sweaty right now.

2130
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,080
I'm liking what you're picking up right now.

2131
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:02,780
I'm liking it.

2132
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:05,760
See if anyone walks in the portal.

2133
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:06,880
Okay.

2134
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,020
They all just turned around.

2135
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,080
You mind-controlled them.

2136
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:11,840
That's fine.

2137
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,860
Anything goes for me.

2138
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,360
He's frozen.

2139
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:24,760
Oh my god, no!

2140
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,460
Oh my god!

2141
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:34,780
We got divided by Hulk!

2142
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:44,960
I want to use my ult, but it's...

2143
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,820
It's never a good situation to use it.

2144
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:52,530
I'll put it on the other tank.

2145
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:14,900
He's frozen, she's frozen!

2146
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,680
Oh my god.

2147
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,780
Alright, I'm going up.

2148
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,080
Hulk is red!

2149
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:58,380
Hulk one, Hulk one!

2150
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:00,600
Nice.

2151
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,180
Oh my god.

2152
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,440
I don't even know if my mic is working.

2153
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,000
I don't know.

2154
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:16,340
I don't know if my mic is even working.

2155
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,560
I'll put it on the other tank.

2156
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,540
Yo, that was so intimidating.

2157
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:56,940
Thank god.

2158
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,800
I'm using attack.

2159
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,260
Damage boosting.

2160
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:03,920
No, I'm getting active.

2161
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:11,100
I'm getting Grooted.

2162
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:13,600
No, not the Groot!

2163
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:13,920
No!

2164
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,120
Where was I?

2165
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:18,700
Mantis ult!

2166
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:24,240
Where was I?

2167
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:25,440
Mantis ult!

2168
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:55,520
Oh.

2169
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:06,600
Was she holding me?

2170
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:11,220
I think we can just Luna ult.

2171
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:13,800
I think we can just Mantis ult with my ult and bubble.

2172
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:15,600
And I think that's GG enough.

2173
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:22,400
You got bubble?

2174
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:31,130
I'm dead, no Mantis ult.

2175
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:33,030
You have Luna ult though, you have Luna ult.

2176
01:58:35,110 --> 01:58:35,550
Nice.

2177
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:36,090
Nice.

2178
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:38,430
She has no ult.

2179
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:39,610
I'm on damage, I'm on damage.

2180
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:39,670
Oh.

2181
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:44,250
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

2182
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:46,030
Come back, come back.

2183
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:51,230
Come on, come on.

2184
01:58:51,930 --> 01:58:52,450
This side.

2185
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:57,190
Starlord, Starlord.

2186
01:59:00,230 --> 01:59:01,130
He's low, he's low.

2187
01:59:01,370 --> 01:59:02,050
Oh, nice.

2188
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:02,810
GG.

2189
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:04,310
GG.

2190
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:05,610
GG.

2191
01:59:05,610 --> 01:59:06,610
Oh my god, is that it?

2192
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:07,710
Is that it?

2193
01:59:10,490 --> 01:59:11,870
Oh my god.

2194
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:13,370
Did we do it?

2195
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:16,410
Did we do it?

2196
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,140
Oh my god.

2197
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:25,480
Is it over?

2198
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:28,400
Is it over?

2199
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:29,600
I don't know.

2200
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:35,100
Oh my god.

2201
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:37,360
I out-healed the other Luna.

2202
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:38,520
Fuck you.

2203
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:44,200
I out-healed the other Luna and I had more accuracy and I did more damage.

2204
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,720
Fuck you, bitch.

2205
01:59:51,310 --> 01:59:52,620
Is that it?

2206
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:55,700
Yes!

2207
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,420
Guys, we

2208
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:04,210
did it.

2209
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:05,810
Oh my god.

2210
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:18,790
I feed a Grandmaster to get here.

2211
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:22,590
I literally feed a Grandmaster to get my elo.

2212
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:25,250
And I played so well.

2213
02:00:25,490 --> 02:00:27,350
I played so fucking well.

2214
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:37,060
Wait.

2215
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,360
GGs.

2216
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:43,300
I had to do some work.

2217
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:47,080
Thank you for the game.

2218
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,400
I'm calling it here.

2219
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:55,700
Ending on good luck.

2220
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:58,080
Good luck with your games.

2221
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:05,000
Oh my god!

2222
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:05,700
Guys!

2223
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:07,720
800k subscribers!

2224
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,260
And top 500!

2225
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:16,780
Screenshot, screenshot.

2226
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,780
Remember to take a screenshot.

2227
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:19,340
Wait, wait, wait.

2228
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:20,500
Let me pose myself.

2229
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,800
Let me pose myself, everybody.

2230
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,480
Before you take the screenshot.

2231
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,620
Before you take the screenshot.

2232
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:30,720
You shout out to Surefort and SK for playing with me.

2233
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,550
I really appreciate it.

2234
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,760
And wanted to...

2235
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:35,700
That's me!

2236
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,240
Remember to put a pointing image over there.

2237
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,820
That's me!

2238
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:42,480
That's me!

2239
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:44,900
I'm top 500 in the world!

2240
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:52,640
Guys, I need you guys to know this is the world leaderboards.

2241
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:55,900
So, like, this is everywhere around the world.

2242
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:57,520
And I did it.

2243
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:03,660
And I won the most stacked lobby ever.

2244
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:05,560
On both sides.

2245
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:09,120
There were so many good players on both teams.

2246
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:14,860
And I beat a fucking grandmaster rank 47 gamer.

2247
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,200
Oh my god.

2248
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,080
And I played.

2249
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:22,940
I think I played really well.

2250
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:25,740
I played really well in that lobby too.

2251
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:27,700
So it's not like I was getting carried or anything.

2252
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:29,140
I did my job.

2253
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:30,840
I kept everybody alive.

2254
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:35,820
And I positioned myself pretty well there.

2255
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:39,760
Am I the first VTuber to hit top 500 in Marble Rivals?

2256
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:40,980
Am I the first one?

2257
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:42,720
If not, I'll be the first one in NA.

2258
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,720
Oh my god.

2259
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:50,860
We did it, guys!

2260
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:53,140
Okay, we fucking did it.

2261
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,680
I'm so...

2262
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:57,060
I'm so happy.

2263
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,120
That's me!

2264
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,160
That's me!

2265
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:06,840
Oh my god.

2266
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:09,280
Well, SK here is a fleshy too.

2267
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:10,910
So, like, the pure...

2268
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,420
The pure only VTuber.

2269
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:15,200
Like, pure form VTubing.

2270
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:18,860
Oh my god.

2271
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:20,740
My face is so red.

2272
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:25,540
My face is so red and flushed.

2273
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:27,500
But, like, thank you everybody.

2274
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,100
Oh my god, thank you guys.

2275
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:31,540
And this is why...

2276
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:34,360
I should have been Gamer of the Year.

2277
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:38,220
I should have been nominated for Gamer of the Year.

2278
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,700
This is why.

2279
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:43,400
Oh my god, thank you guys.

2280
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:45,360
Thank you all for the superchats.

2281
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:46,580
And the congratulations.

2282
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:50,200
We were here three very long days.

2283
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:52,880
We won four games.

2284
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,780
Back to back to back to back.

2285
02:03:55,980 --> 02:04:00,200
We won four games in a row to get here.

2286
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:01,660
And I'm so happy.

2287
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:02,700
I'm really...

2288
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:03,900
I'm really happy.

2289
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,480
Wait, I'm gonna take my own screenshot.

2290
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:08,260
I wanna take my own screenshot too, guys.

2291
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:10,440
I wanna also take a screenshot.

2292
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:12,120
Okay.

2293
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:14,380
I'm gonna take a screenshot right here.

2294
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:15,680
That's me.

2295
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:17,100
That's me.

2296
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:22,140
You guys can take screenshots too, but I'm taking my own as well.

2297
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:26,800
That's me.

2298
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,080
Okay, and then I'm gonna take...

2299
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,840
Okay, I'm gonna do another screenshot too.

2300
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:34,040
There's another screenshot I wanna take too.

2301
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:34,760
Okay.

2302
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:36,600
I wanna...

2303
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:40,260
I wanna do... use...

2304
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:40,840
Where is it?

2305
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:42,980
Where is my other...

2306
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:45,100
Where is the other one that I wanna use?

2307
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:46,060
Oh my god.

2308
02:04:46,060 --> 02:04:47,640
I'm sorry, I'm just so happy, guys.

2309
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:51,120
I'm really, really happy because it took so long, everybody.

2310
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:52,940
It took so long.

2311
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:55,380
But we did it, so I'm like...

2312
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:56,880
So happy, guys.

2313
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:58,680
I'm so fucking happy.

2314
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:01,500
We worked so hard to get here.

2315
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,660
And we fucking did it.

2316
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:06,660
Okay, I'm gonna use this one too.

2317
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:13,800
Whoa.

2318
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:17,420
That's me.

2319
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,060
I'm gonna take this screenshot too.

2320
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:29,060
Oh my god, look.

2321
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,060
Can you see that?

2322
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:31,320
That's me right there.

2323
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:33,320
That's me right there, guys.

2324
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,960
That's me right there.

2325
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:38,080
Oh my god.

2326
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:39,920
I'm so happy.

2327
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:41,260
Oh my god, and look.

2328
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:43,460
Look at the silly number right here.

2329
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:44,420
Oh my god.

2330
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:47,080
Oh my god, look at that.

2331
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And I got it in 69 wins.

2332
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,340
Pure cinema.

2333
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:52,540
Pure cinema.

2334
02:05:58,260 --> 02:06:01,480
I'm sorry, I'm just really happy to be able to accomplish that.

2335
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:04,560
I wanna end top 500 for my rivals this season.

2336
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:10,440
But obviously, now that I did it, it's back to the cage now.

2337
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:18,140
It's back to the cage of... to the gamer work cage to finish up all my...

2338
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:21,220
I stalled a lot of my actual work stuff for this.

2339
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:28,480
I'm sorry to my management team, because I get super obsessive when it comes to rank, that I put everything in the backlog.

2340
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:31,260
And I was like, I'm sorry, I need to play rival rivals now.

2341
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:33,060
I'm so sorry.

2342
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:35,420
I'm so sorry to the staff and everything.

2343
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:50,040
Thank you everybody for watching this long 3 day journey to get here.

2344
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,380
I'm so happy.

2345
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:55,120
And I'm so happy that you guys were here to watch it.

2346
02:06:55,540 --> 02:07:02,440
And the fact that we ended it on the most insane game ever.

2347
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:13,240
The fact that my top 500 game was the sweatiest, high skilled lobby we've ever played so far.

2348
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:14,780
It was crazy.

2349
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:17,740
And I did it all on stream too.

2350
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:21,700
It was the perfect top 500 rank up game.

2351
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,820
Thank you everybody.

2352
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:32,840
And thank you all for being here to celebrate my 800k subscribers.

2353
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:34,040
We got 800k.

2354
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:36,480
You got your dragons here.

2355
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:39,180
And we got top 500 today.

2356
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:42,460
In 3 days, we managed to pull it off.

2357
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:45,580
I will try and end top 500 this season.

2358
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:48,980
The future rank streams will most likely be on Twitch now.

2359
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:50,920
If they're just occasional grinding.

2360
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:54,440
If I want to stream it, I'll be streaming it on Twitch.

2361
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:57,200
So check me out on Doki Breed on Twitch.

2362
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:59,220
I might stream some on YouTube.

2363
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,780
But only if it's scheduled.

2364
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,360
But if I just want to play rank all of a sudden.

2365
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,400
They're unscheduled rank streams.

2366
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:07,880
They'll most likely be on Twitch and not on YouTube.

2367
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:10,840
But for scheduled stuff, I will do it on YouTube.

2368
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:12,740
I'll be doing both.

2369
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,260
I won't do multi-platform.

2370
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:15,760
I don't like multi-streaming in general.

2371
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:16,680
I don't like it.

2372
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,700
I just wanted you guys to know.

2373
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:22,660
So thank you all.

2374
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:23,700
Thank you everybody.

2375

2380
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,640
We have a concert on Saturday.

2381
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:35,560
So I hope to see some of you guys there.

2382
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:36,700
I'm going to call it here.

2383
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:38,420
Because we do have another stream later today.

2384
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:42,320
And I need to do work stuff now.

2385
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,940
But thank you everybody.

2386
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:45,260
We were all here.

2387
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:46,820
We were all here.

2388
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:49,480
Congrats on 800k.

2389
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:50,660
Thank you.

2390
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,000

2393
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:56,180
Thank you all for the superchats and the akas and the members.

2394
02:08:56,640 --> 02:09:00,760
I'll be more mushy about the 800k on the stream tonight.

2395
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:02,720
But thank you everybody.

2396
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:04,480
As always, everyone stay hydrated.

2397
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:05,200
Posture check.

2398
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,040
Get up and move around.

2399
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:06,800
Get that blood flowing.

2400
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:07,980
And you stay up for me head to bed.

2401
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:09,120
Because you deserve it.

2402
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,620
If you guys want to be a gamer like me.

2403
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:11,840
And support me via other means.

2404
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:14,820
I have Hyatt PC cases.

2405
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:16,820
I have custom PC cases and custom keycaps.

2406
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:17,700
So check out that link.

2407
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:19,020
I pinned it in the description.

2408
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:20,560
It's so cool.

2409
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:22,200
It's pretty cool.

2410
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:24,080
So check it out.

2411
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:27,680
Look in the pinned message and chat.

2412
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:31,920
And my mod can copy and paste that link.

2413
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:33,720
Because I'm lazy right now.

2414
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:36,320
Anyway guys.

2415
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:37,360
Bye everybody.

2416
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:38,600
Bye bye.

2417
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:01,180
We're out of the circus.

2418
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:03,400
Don't bust circus.

2419
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:04,840
Goodbye.

2420
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:07,380
