1
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,230
I was like, wait, wait a minute, I'm muted.

2
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,150
Hello everyone!

3
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,750
Oh my god, chat is cut out as well.

4
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,590
Guys, I'm so professional.

5
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,390
I didn't know... okay, give me a sec, I gotta fix chat.

6
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,190
I gotta fix chat.

7
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,170
Give me a sec.

8
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,990
You're cut off a little.

9
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,370
Let me fix you guys.

10
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,930
There we go.

11
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,810
Hello everyone!

12
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,790
Alright, today I'm gonna be showing you guys...

13
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,970
I made a little playlist for you guys.

14
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,410
It's like back in the day when people make mixtapes and be like, please listen to my mixtape.

15
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,850
I made a little video.

16
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,650
I made a little like, uh, video playlist and I'm like, please watch my playlist.

17
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:36,970
Please.

18
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,550
I made this special dragoon playlist.

19
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,190
Well, to be fair, this was my playlist.

20
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,550
I'll be like, that's funny and then I save it.

21
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,430
But then I'm like, this is my Doki playlist for the dragoon.

22
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,470
So please watch my playlist.

23
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,750
The very important videos.

24
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,970
Uh, but welcome, welcome!

25
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,730
Welcome to my react channel that's on Twitch because I don't wanna get in trouble with YouTube.

26
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,450
I'm now trying to re- Some people were asking me, were like, oh, are you gonna like re-upload this?

27
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,130
And I'm just like, I mean, I can try.

28
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,070
I don't know.

29
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:34,610
I'll see what's gonna happen when I re-upload it on like if I like upload the VOD on like on my VOD's channel and just see what happens to it.

30
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,190
So like, you know, I can try.

31
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,370
See, that's the worst.

32
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,710
I mean, it's just, I have three strikes, right?

33
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,030
So like, if I get striked, at least I'll have two more strikes, you know?

34
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,870
Like the first strike is just to test it out and see see what happens, you know?

35
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,430
At least not the main channel.

36
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,370
And technically, if you think about it, that means I have two channels.

37
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,430
So like, that means I can have six strikes.

38
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,170
So like, the more channels I get, the more chances I can have.

39
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,650
So like, maybe I should just create another channel in case the VOD channels get a strike.

40
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,670
And I'll have another channel and that's like a whole new, three more strikes that I have.

41
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,990
Like three more chances.

42
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,390
The five-minute move.

43
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,950
The strike leveling algorithm.

44
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:29,650
Welcome!

45
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,010
Welcome to my Twitch everybody.

46
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,550
It's not gonna be like a, I think like, I'm not gonna be doing this a lot, obviously.

47
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,690
It's just like a special day today.

48
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:49,970
I just was, I wanna be like, let me show you my, I can finally like show you some videos that I've been like wanting to show you guys for a while now.

49
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:57,490
Because in the past we had to like ask individually the channels to be like, can I can I react to your videos?

50
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,390
Can I show your videos?

51
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,430
And they'll either not respond, or just I don't know.

52
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,230
I guess not respond.

53
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:06,850
Thank

54
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,710
you!

55
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,970
I really appreciate it.

56
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,690
Thank you so much!

57
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,550
I almost forgot I was partnered on this, on my Twitch guys.

58
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,670
It's been a while.

59
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,630
It's been a while.

60
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,550
I usually use my, I realized when I was like setting things up on my Twitch channel, I was like, wow.

61
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:34,070
I was, I did not set up anything on my, I did not really set up anything for like solo streams on Twitch.

62
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:41,050
Because every time I streamed on Twitch, it's either for like Twitch rivals or okay, it's usually for Twitch rivals.

63
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,610
So then when I was like setting everything up, I was like, oh my god.

64
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:50,610
There's no like, I don't know how to I don't have any like, by the way, I was like, wait.

65
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,890
Sorry if there's no alerts, because I'm scared of putting my alerts up right now.

66
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,250
Because I don't think, wait, I think I did mute it.

67
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,210
Let me see if I can, I'll put the Twitch alerts.

68
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,970
Because I was like, oh man.

69
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,170
I don't know if I have.

70
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:04,970
Let me see.

71
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,130
Okay, there we go.

72
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,150
Okay, here we go.

73
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,470
That's good.

74
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,930
Okay, that's that's a good sign.

75
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:10,690
Alright.

76
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,190
Twitch alerts are, I think Twitch alerts are muted.

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,550
I think.

78
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,350
So...

79
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,430
So...

80
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,150
That's why I was a little scared.

81
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,270
Because I didn't even like, adjust my Twitch alerts.

82
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,570
Because I was like, oh no.

83
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,870
Is our alerts muted?

84
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,570
I don't know.

85
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,150
I haven't really figured it out yet.

86
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,250
Johnny Lacone, thank you for 20 gifted subs.

87
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,650
Thank you, thank you.

88
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,870
Oh my god, Bacon!

89
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,190
Thank you for the 50 gifted subs!

90
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,730
Thank you, thank you!

91
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,830
I really appreciate it guys.

92
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,230
Thank you so much!

93
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,590
I bet I'm like, Twitch's favorite streamer.

94
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,710
Because I don't use up their bandwidth.

95
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,970
But I still have subs.

96
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,450
So I'm like .

97
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,170
They're like, Give Doki pride, dude.

98
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,770
She doesn't use up our bandwidth.

99
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,250
But she still has people giving her money on Twitch.

100
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,170
Super cost effective.

101
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:18,850
Super cost effective.

102
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:18,850
Yeah.

103
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,910
We're gonna have to resize this alert.

104
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,070
Holy shit.

105
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,030
Alright, I'll play around with it one day.

106
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,210
And I realized, I was like, oh shit, I didn't even upload any like, new emotes in here.

107
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,250
I'm so fucked, man.

108
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,350
I'm so...

109
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,510
But yes, I don't know if like, Sound Guy is alive.

110
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,250
Because like, Sound Guy, if you're here, I need you to message me on Discord.

111
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,370
Because your messages are gonna get drowned out in the regular chat.

112
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:56,730
Because I haven't like, customized my chat in a way that I can see I can see like, I can see mods easier.

113
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,210
I haven't done that yet.

114
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,230
There's a lot of things I haven't done.

115
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,670
You guys are gonna figure it out.

116
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,270
There's a lot.

117
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,110
There's multiple things that I haven't done, guys.

118
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,690
Anyways...

119
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,310
Okay.

120
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,350
Anyway.

121
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,730
Also another update.

122
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,930
Also another update for you guys.

123
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,070
You remember how I said like, oh, next week, I'm going to I'm going to have a a rest week?

124
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,710
Well, about that...

125
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,610
About that...

126
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,610
It might not be a rest week anymore.

127
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,290
Because I sort of like, said yes to a lot of things.

128
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,870
And I didn't... I looked at my calendar, and I was like, oh, it's this week.

129
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,650
I was just like...

130
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,810
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,090
I was like, wait a minute.

132
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,490
They're off for like, next week.

133
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,710
Oh...

134
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,790
No...

135
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,570
I couldn't help it!

136
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,390
Okay.

137
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,170
When you find out what they are, they're pretty exciting.

138
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,450
It's pretty exciting things!

139
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,210
Okay, to be fair, this entire month... month of May, I'm so fucked.

140
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,110
I'm actually...

141
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,370
The month of May, I sort of... I messed up a little bit for the month of May.

142
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,670
Because I said yes to a lot of things!

143
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:30,010
And then, I looked at my calendar, and I was like, oh, at one point, there's going to be like a back-to-back event for one of the days.

144
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,350
And I was like, oh, no...

145
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,530
But like, I'm getting my name out there!

146
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,770
Yahoo!

147
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,790
No rest for content creators!

148
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,570
Let's fucking go!

149
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,590
Oh ho ho ho ho!

150
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,070
Um...

151
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,810
Alright, thank you for the 100 bitties!

152
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,290
Thank you!

153
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,910
Thank you!

154
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,790
Anyway, guys, let me show you guys the first video.

155
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,230
If it's like, let me know if it's like, too... I haven't figured out my Twitch Rivals team yet.

156
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,570
Uh, by the way, um...

157
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,730
I saw like... So basically, like, okay, so like, there's like, how I figured...

158
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:17,570
Like, I... Every time, I would like, so go on, like, Twi... There's a Twitch Rivals schedule, and I look at it ever so often, and then if there's something that interests me, I just press Express Interest.

159
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,110
And then like, my Twitch guy would message me.

160
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,530
I was like, oh, we saw you Express Interest for this.

161
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,610
Do you actually want to do it?

162
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,510
And I'll be like, yeah!

163
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,310
Oh, yeah, sure!

164
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,730
And like, you want to be captain?

165
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,670
I'll be like, oh, yeah, sure!

166
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,290
And...

167
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,610
So now I have to figure out my teammates, cause I haven't really figured out my teammates yet.

168
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,070
There's like...

169
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,850
Not just the Twitch Rivals.

170
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,030
I'm in another Twitch Rivals in two weeks as well.

171
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,110
Cause I'll be like... I'll just be like, do you want to do this?

172
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,890
I'll be like, yeah!

173
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,670
Sure!

174
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,730
And then my DMs will be like, do you want to participate in this tournament?

175
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,970
I'll be like, oh, cool!

176
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,710
Yeah!

177
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,070
Sure!

178
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,350
And then I'll be like, do you want to do this?

179
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,590
Oh, that's cool!

180
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,430
That's pretty cool!

181
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:04,850
Yeah!

182
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:05,910
Sure!

183
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,070
And then I look at my calendar, and it's like, tournament, tournament, event, tournament.

184
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,090
I'll be like, oh!

185
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,870
Maybe not... no more, yeah, sure!

186
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,070
Good!

187
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,010
Thank you for that rate!

188
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:22,670
Thank you!

189
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,350
Thank you!

190
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,310
I really appreciate it!

191
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,330
Thank you so much!

192
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,770
Yeah, so now I'm like, I need to stop saying yeah, sure, to things!

193
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:41,170
And then the next day, someone's gonna... and then I say that to myself, but then the day after, they're gonna be... someone's gonna be like, you want to do this?

194
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,290
I'm like, yeah!

195
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,350
Sure!

196
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,510
So, it just never stops!

197
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,570
Someone let me off this wild ride!

198
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,630
No, not June!

199
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,250
Okay, June might be a little wild, but May is very wild!

200
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,070
May is like, oh!

201
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,690
This month is like, oh!

202
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,370
Alright, I'll show you guys...

203
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,550
I'll show you guys the first video, guys.

204
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,650
Alright, so I saw this and I thought it was really funny.

205
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,950
There's a new crab game that's like, Dark Souls related.

206
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,450
Let me know if it's too loud or not.

207
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,910
Bright, colorful souls like game and thought, this is too happy!

208
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,890
We need more dark and mysterious souls like games.

209
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,350
There just isn't enough out there.

210
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,450
Fair not, fellow gamer.

211
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,210
We have added a new feature to another crab's treasure.

212
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,690
Dark Souls like mode.

213
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,530
This new feature will immediately remove all the vibrant colors of the game and replace it with...

214
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,390
I was sort of like...

215
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,570
I was sort of like... I've been wanting to play this game for a bit, cause like...

216
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,930
It's basically like a happier version of Dark Souls.

217
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,130
So...

218
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,030
And you play like a cra... you play a crab.

219
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,090
So...

220
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,950
So... so it's just...

221
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,090
It's just a happier version of Dark Souls.

222
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,370
I've been wanting to try out for a while.

223
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:07,790
I've been wanting to try out for a while.

224
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,050
I've been wanting to try out for a while.

225
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,210
Anyway, they added depression mode.

226
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,570
Anyway, they added depression mode.

227
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,010
Does Krill appear too happy?

228
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,310
Let's remove that sparkle in his eyes and determination for adventure.

229
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,150
In Dark Souls like mode, Krill will become depressed.

230
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:22,670
Krill will become depressed.

231
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,990
Look at the difference in his look.

232
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,310
Not a hope in sight.

233
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,530
If Krill's depression starts to burn your experience, Dark Souls like mode unlocks a new costume.

234
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,470
You might recognize it for Redacted Redacted Copyright Strike Redacted.

235
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,350
This costume will hide Krill's defeated face.

236
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,670
Someone's gonna mod that.

237
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,590
Dark Souls like mode also turns all levels into a poison swamp.

238
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,090
Dark Souls like mode also turns all levels into a poison swamp.

239
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,090
Because it's not a real Souls like game without one.

240
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,790
Look at that poison-y goodness.

241
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,970
We also added Anor Londo.

242
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,650
Fuck it.

243
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,290
Okay, I got...

244
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,970
Okay, I got this ad on my shorts.

245
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,590
I was like, is that Markiplier?

246
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,870
But the... okay.

247
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,250
But then like...

248
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,490
Okay.

249
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,510
Okay, I just need you guys to know.

250
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,730
I got this ad while scrolling through YouTube shorts.

251
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,270
I got this ad while scrolling through YouTube shorts.

252
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,810
And...

253
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,450
And like...

254
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:19,830
And like...

255
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,890
The plot twist is that not only is that character based off of Markiplier, but...

256
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,830
But it's furry Markiplier.

257
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,630
And like...

258
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,470
Basically it's like...

259
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,070
It's like...

260
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,090
By the way, if anyone wants to download this game, feel free to...

261
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,870
I was just...

262
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,550
I was like...

263
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,710
Wait, this is like...

264
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,690
It's a dating sim.

265
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,330
But like...

266
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,890
Instead of dating the human versions of them, you're dating the...

267
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,870
animals?

268
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,450
But like... they're not... the thing is...

269
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,590
The thing is...

270
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,210
They're not... like...

271
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,310
They're actual animals.

272
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,130
Like, it's not even furry anymore.

273
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,670
They're actually animals!

274
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,290
And I was like...

275
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,930
This is...

276
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,290
I was like...

277
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,290
I was like...

278
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,310
Wait...

279
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,090
That's not...

280
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,810
Now I am a boar.

281
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,470
I was just like, wait a minute.

282
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,550
There's something...

283
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,470
Anyway, it's called Blush Blush.

284
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,030
Can somebody please play this game for me?

285
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,670
And then report back.

286
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,670
Report back?

287
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,230
Can someone play this game and report back to me?

288
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,730
Oh yeah!

289
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,750
Also, I really want to show you guys this video.

290
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,070
Why would we do that?

291
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,570
I want to show you guys this one.

292
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,690
This has been like...

293
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,030
This was rent free in my mind sometimes.

294
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,150
This video.

295
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,550
Blush, blurb, blurb.

296
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,750
This is one of my favorite covers, guys.

297
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,840
Blush, blurb, blurb.

298
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,490
Blush, blurb Blush, blurb, blurb.

299
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,850
Blush, blurb, blurb.

300
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,610
Blush, blurb, blurb.

301
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,470
Blush, blurb, blurb, blurb.

302
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,310
This was made four years ago.

303
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,890
Oh yeah, I should carry this with me.

304
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,570
I love Spongebob Vocaloid.

305
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,190
There's one with Reaper from Overwatch.

306
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,150
And then there's one... there's one... there's so many of Spongebob.

307
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,430
And then there's like Cartman Vocaloids too.

308
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,410
I listen to this cover like once a year!

309
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,230
It's not just me!

310
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,770
It's not AI!

311
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,790
It's Vocaloid!

312
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,510
It's different!

313
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,270
You uncultured swine!

314
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,590
Look at him go!

315
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,830
Look at Squidward go!

316
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,730
Look at the Seacraft!

317
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,390
Look at him go!

318
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,490
Look at the Seacraft!

319
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,610
Can you list all the sources of these videos?

320
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,770
Damn!

321
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,150
Okay.

322
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,690
Spongebob and Squidward, Vocaloid, WOT.

323
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,970
So like what was it the fucking AI rap covers could write?

324
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,110
I don't know.

325
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,710
I don't know.

326
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,230
R.

327
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,830
Ba-ba.

328
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,330
Oh, Squidward go!

329
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,290
He's so kawaii!

330
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,510
Oh my god!

331
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,850
There's the presidential covers!

332
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,330
Wait, you're so right!

333
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,310
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

334
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:13,750
Okay.

335
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,790
Alright guys.

336
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,950
Okay, I need to...

337
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,730
Oh my god!

338
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,190
Plankton!

339
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:17,870
Look at him go!

340
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,790
You guys can't see him.

341
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,290
He's over there on the right.

342
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,330
I'm covering him up.

343
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,510
Have you guys seen the presidential covers?

344
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,190
Of... of...

345
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,450
The AI song!

346
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,430
Go Plankton, go!

347
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,030
Okay, but like...

348
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,590
This is like... Okay.

349
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,630
Okay, I need to show you guys...

350
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,810
The OG.

351
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,710
HAHAHAHAHA!

352
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,950
I need you guys...

353
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,230
I need to show you guys...

354
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,130
The OG.

355
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,110
Where I...

356
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,790
The OG MMD.

357
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,690
The rabbit hole.

358
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,070
I think it's this one.

359
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,930
It has to be this one, right?

360
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,990
This has to be like...

361
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,830
I think this is the OG.

362
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,570
This is the rabbit hole of where I...

363
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,470
Where I...

364
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,930
Where I...

365
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,450
Where I found the MMDs.

366
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,250
HAHAHAHAHA!

367
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,190
Bop, bop, bop!

368
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,300
This was seven years ago, by the way.

369
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,620
Hey!

370
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,500

371
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,440
So beautiful!

372
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,520
He's so kawaii.

373
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,920
This was... This was my rabbit hole.

374
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,200
I kept watching.

375
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,420
My Reaper can't be this kawaii.

376
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,600
Yo, thank you for the hundred minutes!

377
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,540
Thank you, thank you!

378
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,590
Oh my god!

379
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,280
Okay, I'm speaking of this.

380
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,440
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

381
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,220
Speaking of this, have you guys heard of the the Toons Drag Race?

382
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,700
Wait, Toons of Drag Race.

383
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,060

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,430
Okay, I think it's this one.

386
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,030
What was it?

387
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,170
Who is all... who is... Cartoons Drag Race.

388
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,730
Okay, I... that like popped up on my Twitter feed.

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,170
The first season of Cartoons Drag Race.

391
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,170
Okay, no!

392
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,110
Does anyone have the actual YouTube video?

393
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,950
It's on TikTok!

394
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,450
So like nobody has the actual car... video!

395
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:24,730
Please re-upload it on... Please make it... make a YouTube channel!

396
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,390
Okay, Drag Race Cartoons.

397
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,290
Alright, let me see if I can find it.

398
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,430
No!

399
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,510
Guys, I can't react to it because nobody... he didn't make a YouTube channel.

400
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,370
He didn't make a... we're safe... No, it's so funny though!

401
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,550
You don't understand!

402
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,350
Also, here's one with... with our boys.

403
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,330
Omaka.

404
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,710
Sorry!

405
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,620
Omaka, look at his legs!

406
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,540
Look at Soulja's fucking... You wish!

407
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,360
You... That's why we call him legs, guys!

408
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,100
This is exactly why we call him legs!

409
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,820
I'm sorry.

410
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,880
He's just... he's just...

411
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,220
He's just...

412
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,220
he's just...

413
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,040
He's just... he's just...

414
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,400

415
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,330
is my rabbit hole Overwatch MMDs.

416
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:47,170
Other people, other people, dude other people they watch the Overwatch... they watch Overwatch, different Overwatch videos.

417
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,070
I watch this.

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,670
I watch this.

419
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,510
They go to a different site for their Overwatch videos.

420
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,370
I just watch Overwatch on a DVD.

421
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,310
Oh my god.

422
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,830
Bro, all that running though.

423
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,830
It paid off for Soldier.

424
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,090
My Overwatch goes to another.

425
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,030
All I'm saying is that...

426
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:32,970
Okay.

427
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,190
Oh, and then there's this one!

428
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,550
Oh, here's a Cartman version.

429
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,270
Let's see.

430
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,690
Where is it?

431
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,410
I'm trying to find the Cartman version.

432
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,110
Here we go.

433
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,890
Here's a Cartman AI.

434
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:57,810
Number one!

435
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,700
They did like...

436
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,560
I wanted to rabbit hole these covers.

437
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,340
They did various cartoon characters.

438
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,960
It's so good!

439
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,740
Bro!

440
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,260
He's a natural singer!

441
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,040
It's a singer!

442
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,800
There's a lot of them, by the way.

443
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,180
It's not just Carmen.

444
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,880
There's a Peter...

445
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,820
Oh my god!

446
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,300
There's a Peter Griffin one!

447
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

448
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,480
Let me show you guys the Peter Griffin one.

449
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,140
Peter Griffin.

450
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,080
AI.

451
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,200
Oh my god, what was it?

452
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,340
It was a Steven Universe song.

453
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,820
Wait, is this the one?

454
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:16,940
Bro!

455
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,140
AI goes hard!

456
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,960
Bro, why do people use AI unethically?

457
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,840
Why can't we do meme shit like this?

458
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,340
Bro!

459
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,180
Why can't we just do fun stuff?

460
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,900
Why do people have to ruin it?

461
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:43,900
Like...

462
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,140

463
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,240

467
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,540
It's over, isn't it?

468
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,580
Isn't it?

469
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,880
It's over, isn't it?

470
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,280
Isn't it?

471
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,320
Isn't it over?

472
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:13,860
You won, and she chose you, and she loved you, and she's gone.

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,100
It's over, isn't it?

474
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,520
Why can't I move on?

475
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,460
War and glory...

476
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,020
...

477
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,820

Who am I now with this world without her?

482
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,580
Petty and dull, SH�로fl.

Isn't it over?

486
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,440
Why can't we just go on and start over.

487
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,480
It's over, isn't it?

488
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,820
Isn't it?

489
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,660
Isn't it over?

490
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,940
You won and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone.

491
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,080
It's over, isn't it?

492
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,840
Why can't I move on?

493
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,920
Alright, sorry, I went into a rabbit hole of... I'm going through so many different rabbit holes right now.

494
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,860

Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait.

499
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,920
Alright, to be fair, I'll give you guys some normal videos.

500
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,180
That wasn't the playlist.

501
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,180
No, no, no, no.

502
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,900
These are like videos I just went...

503
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,260
I was like, oh my god, I wanna... oh my god, I forgot about these videos too.

504
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,720
Anyway, here are like actual normal videos that I watched by the way.

505
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,180
Here are some actual normal videos.

506
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,120
Okay, I'm gonna recommend you guys a channel that I've actually like really liked to watch ever so often.

507
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,700
And it's like a cooking channel.

508
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,300
But, um...

509
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,360
But like, he does like cookbook reviews, but he does like gamer cookbook reviews.

510
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,900
And he does like gamer cookbook reviews.

511
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,260
And it's like really interesting cause like all...

512
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,080
I always think like who buys these types of cookbooks?

513
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,560
You know like those types of cookbooks where it's like gamer... gaming or anime or like TV show inspired.

514
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,680
And like he does like those like reviews of those cookbooks.

515
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,720
Cause I always wonder who buys these.

516
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,220
Like, who the fuck...

517
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,000
You know, like, oh, family's visiting.

518
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,960
Let me make a...

519
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,900
Let me make an Assassin's Creed meal inspired.

520
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,020
Like...

521
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,220
Like dinner or something.

522
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,460
Yes!

523
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,660
It's me so hungry!

524
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,660
I just finished binging the Fallout TV show.

525
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,960
Okay, this is like actually...

526
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,380
I thought it really captured the unique post-apocalyptic flavor of the games.

527
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,380
And it got me really nostalgic to this.

528
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,820
I really enjoy watching his channel whenever he does like updates.

529
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,520
Honestly, I'm surprised he only has 150k subscribers.

530
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,780
Because like I actually really enjoy watching his videos and stuff.

531
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,620
So like...

532
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,160
So he has like all these like...

533
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,120
He has like cookbook reviews and stuff.

534
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,440
He would be like Bob's Burgers, the Sonic cookbook.

535
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,640
And like...

536
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,580
Oh, like Neopets cookbook.

537
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,660
Uh...

538
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,740
The Rick and Morty...

539
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,720
Let's watch the Rick and Morty one.

540
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,700
Hey, put me over.

541
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,900
Come on!

542
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,140
With the pickle!

543
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,300
Boom!

544
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,920
Big reveal!

545
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,760
I turned myself into a pickle!

546
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,220
I'm Pickle Miso!

547
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,240
Guys, you don't understand.

548
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,720
You don't have a high enough IQ to understand this.

549
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,540
Well, I hear Rick and Morty might be needing a new voice actor.

550
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,940
So think of this as my audition.

551
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,820
Come on, Cartoon Network!

552
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,660
If you have any...

553
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,360
Alright, we're gonna skip this.

554
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,900
This is a little cringe.

555
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,320
It's a little cringe!

556
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,740
It's a little cringe!

557
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,440
It's a little cringe!

558
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:05,380
This book takes us along Rick and Morty's adventure through space and time with a focus on the funky alien foods they come across along the way.

559
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,640
I really dig the way they presented this cookbook.

560
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,660
Basically, for Morty's home economics school project, he decided to put together a cookbook of his family's favorite recipes.

561
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,440
Rick doesn't want Morty wasting his time on this silly school project.

562
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,820
Since they gotta go on adventures.

563
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,400
So what does he do?

564
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,680
Rick fills up the rest of the book.

565
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,640
It's so interesting!

566
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,240
Cause like some of the cookbooks, they're like really well designed with like pictures of the food.

567
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:36,240
Just like the show, it's crazy and wacky and it feels like there's something fun to expect after every page turn.

568
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,140
I really love the layout of the book.

569
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,100
I think it's the perfect balance of text and imagery.

570
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,720
Lots of fun flavor text to read and very close in tone to the dark humor of the show.

571
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,420
There are no F-bombs around.

572
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,940
I don't think there's anything in there that's too much.

573
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,760
There are some mature leading jokes in there that's very on brand.

574
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,480
I also really like how the recipe pages are littered with illustrations and even screenshots from the show.

575
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,380
And the screenshots are usually lifted from the same episode that the recipe is inspired by which is a neat addition.

576
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,520
The food photos are awesome as well and I really like the extra details in the staging of the food.

577
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,020
Some photos have lab equipment in the background to make them look like a part of Rick's lab and some photos have the characters interacting with the food.

578
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:21,140
The abundant illustrations and attention to detail really makes this one of the most thematic and most fun cookbooks to look at.

579
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,000
Not all recipes have photos but in this case I don't even mind because there's so much other good content to supplement it.

580
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,960
The recipes themselves are based off of food from the show or are inspired by references used in the show.

581
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,060
It's not just generic recipes with names thrown on them.

582
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,500
They really tried to draw some color and there are a lot of fun crazy attempts to make some real dishes out of those crazy things.

583
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,000
Really impressed by how the food is made.

584
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,040
You know how some people are just like oh he's just one or two pages but he shows the majority of the book so I don't actually have to buy the book.

585
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,780
I can just like pause the video.

586
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:02,500
I can just pause the video instead of buying the book.

587
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,780
I always find it really interesting.

588
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,000
We're going to skip a lot.

589
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,460
But then he usually does like...

590
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,760
He cooks all of it.

591
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,980
He cooks like...

592
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:24,320
He makes fans pick three recipes that he's going to cook in the cookbook.

593
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,020
And then he does three and then he gives obviously he gives his ratings.

594
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,020
Also he's not like a professional cook or anything.

595
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,680
He's just some like regular guy that just wants to like that just you know he's just like an amateur cook.

596
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,900
He's just like me.

597
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,040
He's just like you.

598
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,940
So it's like anybody can cook type deal.

599
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:59,780
And it's really interesting because like you know he was like obviously like if he can make it like that means I can make it technically and and then he gives like a review and be like which one is good or not.

600
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,660
Less of a hassle you know.

601
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,020
But if you're really looking to make homemade ones then this is a pretty solid recipe.

602
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,900
I like how it's green screen so you don't see the pickle.

603
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,660
But these chili dogs are the ones I've been eyeing up.

604
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,180
They definitely passed the eye.

605
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,380
Yeah he's just some guy.

606
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,320
Taste test with flying colors.

607
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,880
This is pretty dang delicious.

608
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,320
So yeah this is honestly like one this is like one of my favorite channels to watch.

609
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,340
It's like oh my god I was watching the one piece one and then holy shit why is that curry blue?

610
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,560
What the fuck it's blue.

611
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,480
And then he made the bacon pancakes right here.

612
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,740
I watched that one.

613
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,140
And then there's the...

614
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,040
Okay there's one that I saw and I was like...

615
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,680
Wait look at this.

616
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,300
Look!

617
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,780
It's that fucking...

618
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,420
It's the one piece turkey.

619
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,460
It's the one piece turkey.

620
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,020
It looks so...

621
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,100
Okay this looks actually looks so fucking good though.

622
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,920
Like look at that.

623
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,200
It's the one piece turkey.

624
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,060
That looks so good.

625
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,540
The meat's sick.

626
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,060
The meat's sick.

627
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,920
I tried to get more of the drumstick meat which was way more moist and tasted a lot better.

628
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,940
Don't worry he like has his recipe for it.

629
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,680
What the fuck there's an egg inside?

630
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,120
I already forgot there was an egg inside.

631
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,600
How do you make that?

632
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,600
Don't worry just subscribe to Miso Hungry.

633
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,720
The best part is that he tells the recipe in the video.

634
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,420
So you actually don't have to buy the book.

635
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,920
Like you can just follow the recipe in his video.

636
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,940
Which is the...

637
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,960
But if you really want to support...

638
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,720
If you want to support the cook...

639
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,140
The publisher you should buy the book.

640
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:51,940
But...

641
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,780
But like you know if you really want to support the publisher.

642
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,360
You could also buy the book.

643
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,380
But like the best part is that you know he gives like a step-by-step guide in the video itself.

644
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,400
So like I don't have to worry about like trying to figure out the recipe.

645
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh my god I'm so hungry now looking at this.

646
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,460
See I think it's this one right?

647
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,340
No that's the meat on the bone here.

648
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,320
Meat on the bone.

649
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,320
This version of meat on the bone isn't as simple as you think though cause...

650
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,620
There's a whole egg inside.

651
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,240
This recipe is gonna need four chicken drumsticks.

652
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,700
Apparently we're supposed to make tulips out of them.

653
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,360
Oh it was a turkey it's a chicken.

654
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,300
The recipe images are so small that it's kinda hard to make sense.

655
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,280
But I think I figured it out.

656
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,740
So you take your scissors and start at the handle end.

657
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,800
Stick it under the skin and cut up to the meat.

658
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,400
Cutting as close to the bone as possible.

659
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,760
Why did you start with food videos?

660
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,420
No we started off with like...

661
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,340
We definitely did not start with food videos.

662
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,300
So yeah meat tulip or a meat bell or a meat upside down umbrella.

663
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,580
So that you'll have the meat exposed.

664
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,660
I'm sorry to all the vegans and vegetarians that are watching this.

665
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,280
Then you're gonna take a quarter cup of bread crumbs and salt.

666
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,260
Then you're gonna soak it in three tablespoons of milk.

667
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,060
Not that much work to be honest.

668
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,600
You just cut a chicken in half.

669
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,500
And a bowl mixed together 18 ounces of 500 grams of ground chicken.

670
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,560
With one teaspoon of salt.

671
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,980
You started with Vocaloid.

672
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,220
But not the Vocaloid you're expecting.

673
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,960
Knead it all together and then mix in the milky bread crumbs and knead it again.

674
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Now to assemble the drumsticks.

675
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,480
You're gonna need one hard boiled egg per chicken drumstick.

676
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,160
Take the layers of meat and grate it around a hard boiled egg.

677
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,620
I see.

678
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,060
Then take the meat mixture and cover the drumstick and egg.

679
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,860
So it looks like one honking drumstick.

680
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,060
Just like in the anime.

681
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,640
When everything is assembled.

682
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:53,520
Bake the drumsticks in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes.

683
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,400
If your drumstick still looks pale.

684
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,800
I would raise the temp to 450.

685
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,800
And then broil it for another 5 to 10 minutes.

686
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,580
To give it that nice brown color.

687
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,260
Which is what I did.

688
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,320
When done you should have four nice plump meat on the bowl.

689
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,440
Better eat them before we get to it.

690
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,060
God damn it.

691
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,800
If I wasn't a fucking streamer I'd do this.

692
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,600
This is like one of my favorite channels.

693
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:24,140
I'm really happy whenever they have new episodes.

694
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,100
I was like time to watch.

695
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,540
But I feel like he's so high effort.

696
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,400
The stuff he does.

697
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,200
And his video production.

698
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,060
It's so high effort for 150.

699
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,100
50k subscribers.

700
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,260
You guys should check him out.

701
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,840
He's actually.

702
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,340
I feel like he's very underrated.

703
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,440
Um.

704
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,420
Also here's one of my favorite videos.

705
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,680
I talked about it before.

706
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,920
But I wanted to show you guys.

707
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,580
Because I couldn't show it on YouTube.

708
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,700
It was me Barry.

709
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,140
I made them draw Lola Bunny with fewer sexual features.

710
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,760
So that you wouldn't be horny.

711
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,140
And reduce your blood flow to make you a millisecond slower.

712
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,880
Is it slow enough for me to kill Iris?

713
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,420
Remember when you were making out with your mom.

714
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,200
Your first girlfriend.

715
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,320
It was me Barry.

716
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,380
And you came right as she touched your leg.

717
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,880
It was me Barry.

718
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,420
I jerked you off at super speed.

719
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,140
So it seemed like you nutted at just a woman's touch.

720
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,940
Sorry I had to.

721
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,740
It was me Barry.

722
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,540
It was honestly.

723
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,940
One of my favorite.

724
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,040
Reverse flash.

725
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,600
Reverse flash lines.

726
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,980
It's a classic.

727
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,200
It's such a classic.

728
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,480
Oh my god.

729
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,840
So my favorite DC animator.

730
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,840
She does team fortress 2 animations too.

731
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,100
Spineapples.

732
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,580
I don't know if you guys know Spineapples.

733
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,520
But I fucking love her animations.

734
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,200
And her team fortress 2.

735
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,180
And like.

736
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,780
Her team fortress 2.

737
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,680
And DC animations.

738
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,260
They're so good.

739
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,460
Like this one.

740
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,890
I love Spineapples.

741
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,230
What is this?

742
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,190
It's a meme Batman.

743
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,250
I don't understand.

744
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,050
What do you not understand?

745
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,850
I don't get the joke.

746
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,970
Well you see.

747
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,410
People usually only play on one console.

748
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,390
But both these women are so attractive.

749
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,970
That you'd want to play with them both.

750
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,970
But they aren't consoles.

751
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,530
It's a classic.

752
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,790
The shirts they're wearing have the console logos on them.

753
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,890
What are you some kind of furry?

754
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,610
You're the one here wearing an animal suit.

755
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,030
Okay.

756
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,070
It's true.

757
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,790
It's true.

758
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,790
I think Batman's a furry.

759
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,350
Because why else would he dress up as a bat?

760
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,470
Checkmate.

761
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,970
But you guys should check out Spineapples.

762
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:52,710
He's like.

763
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,810
They're one of my favorite.

764
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,090
They're one of my favorite like animators.

765
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,090
They're like so OG.

766
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,270
Holy shit.

767
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,010
Some of their animations are like.

768
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,930
What is it?

769
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,230
Like four plus.

770
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,590
Four plus years ago.

771
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,690
Oh my God.

772
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,850
This rap.

773
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,650
The rap battle.

774
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,890
Do you guys know the spy rap?

775
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,230
Do you guys know the spy rap?

776
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,070
The one with the spy versus tree suit?

777
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,870
Oh, it's Sombra?

778
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,150
Oh, wait, what was it?

779
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,910
Scout versus Tracer was the OG rap.

780
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,150
Oh my god, okay guys, guys, guys, OG, OG raps.

781
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:56,650
Scout?

782
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,010
It's not cringe!

783
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,210
It was not cringe!

784
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,090
It's actually so good!

785
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,430
Back when like everyone fucking did rap battles, every...

786
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,630
Like you know how like rap battles are like...

787
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,930
Rap battles of history, like pioneered...

788
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:15,170
Okay, they didn't pioneer rap battles, like it was there for a while, but...

789
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,810
It's not cringe!

790
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,970
They were so good!

791
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,030
But like it made rap battles like with like...

792
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,890
What's the word?

793
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,750
With like pop culture really popular.

794
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,910
So then people did like parodies with...

795
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,310
They did parody... Oh my god, it's still going?

796
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,210
They're so old now.

797
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,950
They did like parodies with like games and like anime and stuff like that.

798
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,150
Fucking... Bro, I love the Scout versus Tracer.

799
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,950
Scout versus Tracer was really good.

800
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,970
From JT... Oh my god, Machinima.

801
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,570
I actually have the song in my fucking playlist!

802
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,990
It's not cringe!

803
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,230
This was six years ago!

804
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,210
It was like... It's history.

805
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,970
We were part of history!

806
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,470
You don't... Oh yeah, we don't miss Machinima.

807
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:23,830
It's not cringe!

808
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,130
Oh my god, it actually slaps!

809
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,610
It's just the animation's old!

810
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,150
It was six years ago!

811
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,910
It's not cringe!

812
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,390
It's not cringe!

813
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:50,380
Stop!

814
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,820
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

815
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,380
Somebody said that they nerfed Tracer's ass, but like...

816
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,400
It never... It didn't really change that much to be fair.

817
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,760
I feel like... Okay, wait.

818
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,560
Sombra's spy was good too.

819
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,080
Guys, I swear!

820
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,660
You guys just don't understand!

821
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,800
Today's rap battle is brought to you by Roblox!

822
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,080
King weapon, free for...

823
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,120
It's not!

824
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,280
And the man is dead!

825
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,680
Cigar V is dead.

826
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,400
I should know.

827
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,800
I killed it.

828
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,100
Who's that?

829
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,220
Trust to the night!

830
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,100
No globes, seven stars!

831
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,700
You're so good at rapping!

832
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,060
With a glassy suit and tie!

833
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,460
Who will look good at your funeral?

834
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,540
It's not a face!

835
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:38,900
It's time to murder this track!

836
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,820
And find a knife in his back!

837
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,580
Got equipment?

838
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,740
Watch me break it!

839
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,960
It's not even Sombra!

840
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,540
This was literally six years ago!

841
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,480
He perpetrated plenty bases!

842
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
Stole your intel!

843
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,360
What a rush!

844
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,140
Even though there wasn't much!

845
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,880
Wait, there's Mercy vs Medic?

846
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,480
I've never seen the Mercy vs Medic one.

847
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,400
What's the Mercy vs Medic?

848
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,980
They did so many.

849
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,860
Prepare yourselves for a rap battle that would give you a front before.

850
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,100
God damn.

851
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,280
The animation is so dated.

852
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,500
The track is so brutal now.

853
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,620
Take it away from me!

854
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,560
It's time for your party!

855
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,040
Where's Medic?

856
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,000
The doctor is in!

857
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,600
Heroes never die!

858
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,060
But you're not one of them.

859
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,860
I arrive on swift wings like a bird in a hurry.

860
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,660
If you have an emergency, get boiled out to Mercy.

861
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,620
I may have a halo, but I am no angel.

862
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,100
With my damage buffs, I can make your life painless.

863
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,740
Where's Medic?

864
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,980
I don't care about Mercy.

865
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,200
Woahhh!

866
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,440
Okay, not gonna lie, the voice acting for this is pretty good!

867
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:35,840
The music is so good.

868
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,280
And the cast is so cute!

869
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:37,520
Haha!

870
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,720
Not a single voice in this!

871
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,280
ressurect in the silence.

872
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,220
No.

873
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,540
Where's Medic?

874
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,760
Okay, this one's pretty bad.

875
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,160
I'll admit, this one was pretty bad.

876
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,320
I'll give you guys that.

877
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,500
That one was pretty bad.

878
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,520
Okay, but did you guys know, like, the TF2, like, cast...

879
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,940
cast actually did, like, a song cover together?

880
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,640
I saved it because I was like, Whoa, what?

881
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,420
That's the Team Fortress 2 voice actors.

882
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Okay, where is it?

883
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,020
I saved the video too.

884
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,640
It's called the Sandwich Blues.

885
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,480
They actually did, like...

886
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,340
Yeah, they did.

887
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,300
This was, like, a month ago.

888
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:17,800
Last month.

889
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,540
Yeah, they're doing, like, song covers now, which I thought was funny.

890
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,240
Which I thought was funny.

891
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,260
Oh god, they're so old.

892
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,480
Yeah, I think they're, like, in their 50s or 60s now.

893
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,900
Or, they have to be in 60s.

894
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,580
Those actors are so talented.

895
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,200
I can only do, like, three voices.

896
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,660
Child.

897
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:10,980
No.

898
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,200
And this.

899
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,080
We got a sandwich blues.

900
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,900
It's taking a toll.

901
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,480
Oh yeah,

902
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,720
this voice, the...

903
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,680
What was it?

904
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,500
What's her name?

905
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,080
The announcer?

906
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,740
The announcer in sniper.

907
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,360
Like...

908
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,660
Yeah,

909
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,340
they're doing like...

910
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,220
They're doing music covers now together, which I thought was really cute.

911
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,600
That's the Sandwich Blues!

912
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,960
That's so it!

913
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,340
Sandwich Blues!

914
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,580
Sandwich Blues!

915
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,180
Alright guys, now we're gonna see something really cursed.

916
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,680
I need to show you guys this video.

917
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
Look at this hippie crap!

918
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,460
Hahahaha!

919
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,620
I'm sure no one will be creeped out by this.

920
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:52,760
No!

921
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,620
This popped up.

922
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,580
I like...

923
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,120
Look!

924
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,500
It's the Boston Dog!

925
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,720
Look at it!

926
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,280
For those who don't know, they're gonna create something very special.

927
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,460
So I bought a robotic dog.

928
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:11,620
Hahaha!

929
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,040
This video is brought to you by Squarespace.

930
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:14,980
The all-in-one platform...

931
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,740
No, not this video.

932
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,020
Hahaha!

933
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,940
So what... So they're gonna make something beautiful today with Furby.

934
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,360
So how are we actually gonna turn our robot into a Furby?

935
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,180
Well, we know someone who has a lot of experience 3D printing Furby projects.

936
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,560
I never...

937
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,220
Like these masks.

938
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,560
Probably want that mask.

939
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,480
Holy shit, that's terrifying.

940
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,540
That's fucking terrifying.

941
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,960
By the way, I've never watched the full video.

942
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,940
I only watched like the final product.

943
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,560
So I actually don't know what...

944
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,620
I don't know how they made this.

945
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,480
Our first step was to 3D scan the robot and send it to him so he could accurately model the Furby parts for it.

946
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,900
I'm collecting so many points of data.

947
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,840
I'm gonna angle down and kind of get some of the nooks and crannies.

948
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,400
Show me your crannies.

949
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,180
Alright.

950
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,140
Evan's zooming in on his butt.

951
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,640
What good posing.

952
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,260
So we just got an update from Austin.

953
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,120
He has a few different mockups of different forms the Furby could take.

954
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,220
Wait, different forms?

955
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:13,920
There's more than one?

956
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:14,500
Check it out.

957
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:22,620
When we were originally talking about this idea, Evan was showing like, see if we can try to put the Furby's face like directly over the front of it.

958
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,120
Oh god, that's more terrifying than what it was.

959
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,480
Than what it came to be.

960
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:29,860
Than what it came to be.

961
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,620
The best ones that I could think of and included like some of the pros and cons.

962
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,620
And I think we've got...

963
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,080
Yes, I'm ready.

964
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,700
So the first option...

965
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,560
Oh god, oh no.

966
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,580
I'm just gonna say this up front.

967
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,440
It's possible that these mockups might be too good.

968
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,380
I'm afraid that might not be one of the expectations.

969
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,420
I know, that's really good.

970
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:51,920
Such glorious heights.

971
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,400
Here we go, we'll start with the pros.

972
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,320
He's huggable.

973
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,320
He's huggable.

974
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,620
Like you hug this Furby.

975
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,520
I thought about like baby doll arms sort of thing.

976
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:00,840
Yes.

977
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,100
Yeah.

978
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,180
There's plenty of room for the electronics cons.

979
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,060
It might just look like it's a Furby sitting on a dog's head.

980
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,600
Attachment points is another thing that we might need to figure out.

981
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,500
Yeah, we want to make sure it's not top heavy and toppling.

982
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,940
Wait, was it the spider?

983
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,760
Oh no!

984
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,600
It's like two creatures merged together.

985
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:23,620
Oh no!

986
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,640
I'm so uncomfortable.

987
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,520
Arachnophobia.

988
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,180
Arachnophobia.

989
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,040
Once again, it could look like a Furby is riding back the dog.

990
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,600
We could have people commenting how it doesn't actually have six legs.

991
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,840
Well spiders have eight legs, so we'd have a lot of legs.

992
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,660
I like the spider.

993
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,360
So this is the last one.

994
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,960
I call this one Mr. Nodak.

995
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:45,900
What is that?

996
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,080
Oh god!

997
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,600
It looks like a primate Furby.

998
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,000
It uses less material.

999
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,440
Yeah, very human-like.

1000
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,860
It's so cool.

1001
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,180
That looks so cool though.

1002
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,960
Look, think of the Twitch Prime.

1003
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,780
Thank you.

1004
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,740
It's... oof.

1005
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:07,020
But the original thing that brought up this whole issue was the front sensors.

1006
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,820
Yeah.

1007
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,020
It might be okay, but we could just avoid the whole worry by going with the centaur.

1008
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,500
You know?

1009
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,000
Right.

1010
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:19,040
Even though Mr. Nodak looks amazing, and that was actually one of my original visions, I'm most curious about the centaur.

1011
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:19,500
What about you?

1012
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,880
I am also, I think, leaning towards centaur.

1013
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,920
I feel like it gives us a little bit more wiggle room in terms of electronics.

1014
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,400
And honestly, I thought it would be much more curse-feeling to me, but he almost feels like a llama.

1015
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,600
Oh yeah!

1016
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,100
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

1017
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,500
He looks so huggable!

1018
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:42,040
To be fair, if you compare this with the other two that we saw, like, this looks so cute now.

1019
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:48,640
This looks actually cute compared to the other ones that we saw.

1020
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,520
It actually makes it look good.

1021
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,280
I mean, compared to the fucking spider and the Nodak?

1022
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:58,920
Come on!

1023
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,840
I don't think we have any moving parts though.

1024
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,820
So we thought we'd add a pop of color with pink, inspired by the original gray and pink Furby we bought.

1025
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,860
I had a Furby.

1026
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,840
I had the Furby and those little dog ones.

1027
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,580
The little dog pets.

1028
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,280
And then the... how is it?

1029
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,460
The cat ones as well.

1030
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,760
Nodak was not cute.

1031
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,440
I don't know what you guys are thinking.

1032
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,500
Nodak was not cute.

1033
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,640
It looks like a fucking monkey with a Furby attached to its head.

1034
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,880
We can just shave it, right?

1035
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,600
Yeah.

1036
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,300
That's making it better.

1037
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,440
Oh, for real friends!

1038
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,780
Yes!

1039
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,200
That's a pretty good match.

1040
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,900
Yeah, it's a good match for the gray.

1041
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,500
You combine that with the pink, I feel like it's very Furby-esque.

1042
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,980
That's very Furby-esque.

1043
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,060
We did it, baby.

1044
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,340
He's gonna be so hairy.

1045
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,060
He's gonna be so hairy.

1046
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:53,440
I like how they're giving us a tutorial on making our very own Furby.

1047
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,360
It's so Furbycore.

1048
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:54,880
Yeah.

1049
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,940
You cover that with tape.

1050
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:01,100
And then you Sharpie over the tape, cut out your pattern, and then make that in fabric.

1051
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,420
Yeah, let's see how this works.

1052
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,920
And I think the good news is...

1053
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,080
I need you guys to know, these cost like...

1054
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,840
What is it?

1055
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,120
They cost like more than 30 grand, right?

1056
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,340
The Boston Robots on its own?

1057
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:13,780
Yeah.

1058
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,560
Any super rich dragoons want to make a dragoon version of this?

1059
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,500
That would be pretty good.

1060
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,060
And one of them will only have to do these legs.

1061
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,080
A dragoon version?

1062
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,440
Oh, like 10k.

1063
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,420
Oh, it's less now.

1064
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,180
It used to be like crazy expensive when they first launched.

1065
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,520
Oh, it's 1,600 now?

1066
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,920
Wait, that's a steal!

1067
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,060
Any like, engineer dragoons?

1068
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,080
Any engineer dragoons that can make this?

1069
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,960
Oh yeah, because it's like mass produced now.

1070
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,640
When it first came out, it was like crazy fucking expensive.

1071
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:46,720
The lady didn't cut it.

1072
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,640
She ripped it.

1073
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,880
Which may be is best practice for this type of fabric.

1074
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,480
But she had to use so much effort.

1075
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,120
She was like, hold on.

1076
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,860
I need to chug this real quick.

1077
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,720
I couldn't buy one, but I'm not an engineer.

1078
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,120
I can't make my own dragoon version of this.

1079
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,020
And then she moved on to another one.

1080
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,900
And I was like, can I help?

1081
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,140
I didn't know what to do to be helpful.

1082
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,820
But she was just destroying this thing.

1083
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,460
Oh, it's now from Boston Dynamics?

1084
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,580
It's a bootleg?

1085
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,480
Can I copy your homework?

1086
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,160
Let me change it up a little bit.

1087
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,320
Okay, let's take a little dress.

1088
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:20,860
I'm gonna buy a dress.

1089
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,180
It's like a little dress for sure.

1090
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,100
Oh yeah.

1091
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,360
This cut's fine.

1092
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,060
I don't know why she didn't cut it.

1093
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,780
They just need some heavy freaking duty scissors.

1094
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,360
They have heavy freaking duty scissors.

1095
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,940
It's Joanne's.

1096
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,580
I don't know what was going on.

1097
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,860
Either way, I was rooting for her the whole time.

1098
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,460
Can I see that cross section?

1099
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,340
And then the short...

1100
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,300
So I'm gonna skip the...

1101
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,860
I'm gonna skip the fur part.

1102
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,860
Oh my god.

1103
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,240
What?

1104
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,060
Look at it.

1105
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,680
That's kind of glorious.

1106
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,440
Do you want to do the rest of the leg?

1107
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,380
And see what it looks like?

1108
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,340
Oh, they're like plastic wrapping it.

1109
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,920
So the fur doesn't come off.

1110
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,380
Oh, they're getting the pattern.

1111
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,600
I see.

1112
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,600
There you go.

1113
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,900
Can you imagine it?

1114
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,100
We're skipping the fur part of the Furby.

1115
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,760
Oh my god.

1116
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,220
We did such a good job.

1117
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,000
It actually looks so good.

1118
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,480
You guys!

1119
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,920
You guys can see the Boston 9-Eleven is really crazy expensive.

1120
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,700
And having a little bit showing at the elbow and stuff.

1121
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,620
It doesn't bother me at all.

1122
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,700
Here it is.

1123
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,520
You zoom out.

1124
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,020
You don't even notice that.

1125
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,220
Oh!

1126
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,720
Hey, thank you for the...

1127
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,480
Thank you for the tier one set.

1128
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:32,860
Thank you.

1129
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,380
See, it doesn't look that fucked up.

1130
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,500
The race is getting a Furby.

1131
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,700
When we started this project, I really had no clue how we were gonna make it happen.

1132
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,320
It doesn't look that bad, guys.

1133
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,320
I'll tell you guys, the end result looks so cute.

1134
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:49,800
We're doing it.

1135
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,940
We're not doing any of those patterns or anything like that.

1136
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,120
But we are winging it and it's working.

1137
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,300
Okay.

1138
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,440
Can you walk without the fur getting caught in the joints?

1139
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,040
I was not smart enough to do this.

1140
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,020
Maybe we check after the walk.

1141
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,560
Imagine my stream just making Furby abominations.

1142
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,700
Oh my god!

1143
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,520
We're getting dance!

1144
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,600
Oh yeah, he's moving.

1145
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,540
Oh, he's moving and grooving.

1146
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,740
That's so cute!

1147
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,140
This is my new pet.

1148
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,340
Yeah!

1149
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:20,560
Yeah!

1150
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,020
Hey, little guy.

1151
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:32,000
I remember when the Boston Dynamics released the first video, the dog, and all they did was just push it around and hit it.

1152
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:32,800
It was so...

1153
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,060
People were like, no!

1154
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,940
Can we know a little bit of what we're doing?

1155
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,860
But we haven't seen what it looks like.

1156
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,320
Stop!

1157
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,560
Is that a note?

1158
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,780
Oh my god.

1159
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,120
Awesome.

1160
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,240
The exhilarating Furbot instruction manual.

1161
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,780
Oh my gosh!

1162
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,700
Look at this!

1163
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,460
This is so fantastic!

1164
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,400
First thing I see is this adorable thing.

1165
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,140
Yeah, you guys are gonna see an even more adorable thing later.

1166
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,200
Look at the gaming person!

1167
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,540
That's a Squarespace!

1168
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,480
No!

1169
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,660
I don't get paid!

1170
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,040
I'm gonna create a website and make you a kiss.

1171
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,120
Squarespace doesn't sponsor this!

1172
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,300
Guys, no!

1173
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,460
Don't type that URL!

1174
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,060
Instead, type the gamersubs way!

1175
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,400
Don't type this URL!

1176
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:22,980
Step 1.

1177
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,460
Insert both support arms into the main support base and tighten both screws using a 2-inch hex key.

1178
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,140
We don't get paid!

1179
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,220
Step 2.

1180
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,500
Slide battery power bank into dedicated slot on backup quadruped.

1181
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,280
Step 3.

1182
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,600
Wrap, buckle, and tighten down both support straps around the quadruped robot's Guys, I'll pay somebody to follow these instructions.

1183
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,880
Okay, play Furby body on air.

1184
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,000
And...

1185
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,360
and make a Dragoon version of this.

1186
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,680
I will pay you.

1187
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,160
I will pay Dragoon to make a Dragoon version of this.

1188
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,560
I will pay Dragoon to make a Dragoon version of this.

1189
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,100
Yeah, it's just like the bones.

1190
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,680
I can see the mouth through there.

1191
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,820
Where's your Squarespace sponsorship?

1192
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,380
I don't know Squarespace!

1193
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,500
Where is my Squarespace sponsorship?

1194
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,440
That's asleep right now.

1195
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,840
Oh, this is...

1196
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,860
Oh my god!

1197
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,180
And then have it run around conventions.

1198
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:10,660
And then have it run around conventions.

1199
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,380
And just terrorize people.

1200
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,150
And then have it run around conventions.

1201
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,450
Oh god.

1202
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,990
I don't like I think he looks worse with the eyes closed.

1203
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,150
Oh, I hate that.

1204
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:26,370
I don't like that.

1205
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,830
I think it's like really bad because he doesn't even have fur.

1206
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,250
It's like a skinned Furby.

1207
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,390
God save us all.

1208
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:34,710
God save us all.

1209
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:35,570
God save us all.

1210
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,950
God save us all.

1211
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:39,950
That's awful.

1212
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,390
Maverick, thank you for the 25k!

1213
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,050
Thank you!

1214
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,570
He's like awakening as he's being operated on.

1215
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,670
Like his anesthesia is lifting.

1216
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:50,270
Oh my god!

1217
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:50,850
Oh god!

1218
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,670
Let's open the box.

1219
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:53,990
Okay.

1220
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,090
Let's open this last box.

1221
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,250
I hate this abomination.

1222
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,170
So sweet.

1223
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:06,790
Oh my god!

1224
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,050
Hahaha!

1225
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,050
Is that...

1226
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,390
Is that...

1227
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,590
Is that...

1228
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,510
Oh!

1229
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:12,850
So cute!

1230
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,250
They made pens dispenser as a gift!

1231
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,710
Stop looking at me!

1232
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,370
Mmm.

1233
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,290
Just like chalk.

1234
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:27,970
Okay.

1235
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,050
Back to it.

1236
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,770
Back to it.

1237
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:30,830
Let's make it say something.

1238
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:31,650
Ready?

1239
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,310
Yeah.

1240
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:37,130
Oh!

1241
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,090
Do... do... do...

1242
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,230
It's doing it.

1243
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,690
Subscribe... subscribe to...

1244
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:43,290
EVEN!

1245
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:45,770
Okay.

1246
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,430
Look.

1247
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,670
For all the...

1248
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:48,930
I'm saying...

1249
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:49,970
All I'm saying, Dragoons.

1250
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,110
I'll pay someone to make a Dragoon equivalent version of this.

1251
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:56,210
And then I want it to run around different conventions.

1252
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,170
And be like...

1253
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,630
Subscribe to...

1254
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,190
Doki...

1255
00:59:59,500 --> 00:59:59,830
Baby!

1256
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:03,690
EVEN TIME!

1257
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:04,890
EVEN TIME!

1258
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:06,590
EVEN... EVEN... EVEN...

1259
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:07,910
hmmm.

1260
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,610
I want it to...

1261
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,890
I want it to start killing me.

1262
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:14,770
Hahaha!

1263
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,010
I will pay...

1264
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:18,770
DIY Fairy Figures for my poorly written voice.

1265
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,110
Smart engineering Dragoon to do this.

1266
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,410
I will...

1267
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,450
I will do it.

1268
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,550
I think...

1269
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,330
I think the investment...

1270
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,690
The investment...

1271
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,110
We will meet in less than a day.

1272
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,370
It goes a long way.

1273
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,550
You and your large touch on the back of the Fur Bot.

1274
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,390
If curiosity got the best of you.

1275
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:35,430
You may have found...

1276
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,930
Curse mode?

1277
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:43,450
What's curse mode?

1278
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,450
I'm so tempted to press it.

1279
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,090
I know, me too.

1280
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,330
I wanna press it.

1281
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,490
But I feel like we need to finish him first.

1282
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:53,450
And then see what can be more cursed than he already is.

1283
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:54,810
Oh!

1284
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,870
The Dark Souls!

1285
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,830
The curse of Herbie.

1286
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,890
Oh my god!

1287
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:09,530
Yes!

1288
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,410
This is everything that I hoped for!

1289
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,650
I see!

1290
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,610
Thank you for the Twitch Prime!

1291
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:13,050
Thank you!

1292
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,570
The power stats.

1293
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,130
Wait, is that even curse mode?

1294
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,470
Is it curse mode yet?

1295
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:22,290
I'm ready.

1296
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,890
Oh yeah, they're gonna put fur on it now?

1297
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:28,730
Help!

1298
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:30,750
Oh my god!

1299
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,290
Oh my god!

1300
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,230
They're like mummifying it.

1301
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,130
It's almost like they're mummifying the Furby.

1302
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,540
I 3D printed some ears.

1303
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,160
Can you see me?

1304
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,240
I can see you.

1305
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,060
It's evolving in real time.

1306
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,020
It's getting so dusty.

1307
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,300
I'm literally immune.

1308
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,840
I seriously think I'm more used to cat hair being on me.

1309
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,900
Like, this is normal.

1310
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:09,760
I don't know.

1311
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,520
It's like more fur than robotics if you think about it.

1312
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,160
Oh god, his neck is so long.

1313
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,540
Guys, don't look yet.

1314
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:37,040
There's another child I really like to watch that does like, that does like, re-purposing like Halloween decorations.

1315
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,430
Oh my god, look at his little stripe.

1316
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,550
Oh my god, shaking his booty.

1317
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,310
Not to pat ourselves on the back, but like...

1318
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,370
We did a really good job with his fur.

1319
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,170
Oh my god, he's outside!

1320
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:08,530
He is very cursed, but he can still move around, but he's got that Furby vibe.

1321
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,510
There you go!

1322
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:17,190
Bro, he's better than a real dog!

1323
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,390
Because he can actually talk!

1324
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:26,030
He'll be like, Doki, what happened to Doki Amber Doge?

1325
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:29,490
Oh!

1326
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,190
He's got eggs!

1327
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:34,390
YAYS!

1328
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,990
Now let's let our new friends introduce themselves.

1329
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,630
Hello, Evan.

1330
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:47,520
Thank you for helping my past owner bring me to life.

1331
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,500
With Dylan,

1332
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,370
I am no longer male or

1333
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,080
now.

1334
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,800
Coco seems like a nice guy.

1335
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:18,560
So I think he's ready to be introduced to the world.

1336
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,180
What do you think?

1337
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:19,860
He seems safe.

1338
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,360
Yeah!

1339
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:21,660
Safe!

1340
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,940
Coco seems like a nice guy!

1341
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,980
Oh my god!

1342
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,240
Seeing him move like that is so scary!

1343
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,560
Oh my god!

1344
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,980
He's like shaking his hips!

1345
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,340
Oh yeah!

1346
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:32,920
The evil mode!

1347
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,380
We never got to see evil mode!

1348
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:35,700
I never got to see evil mode!

1349
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,960
Evan's pushing the button!

1350
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,660
What's evil mode?

1351
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,320
What does it look like?

1352
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,500
Oh, I don't like... oh...

1353
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,360
Oh, I don't like evil... OHHHH!

1354
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,740
I don't... I don't like evil mode.

1355
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,260
HAHAHA!

1356
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,040
Imagine just having this...

1357
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,420
Just running around during Halloween.

1358
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,760
Oh no.

1359
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,560
It like looks towards me.

1360
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:22,320
Can I be... thank you for the tier one sub!

1361
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:22,660
Thank you!

1362
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:25,940
Nooooo!

1363
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,640
Okay, back in normal mode.

1364
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,620
Shall we take him out?

1365
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,720
Let's take him out!

1366
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,720
I'm sure no one will be creeped out by this.

1367
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:38,880
No!

1368
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,200
No!

1369
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,260
So I watched the ending.

1370
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,760
I skipped all the... I skipped like how to make it.

1371
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,660
But I watched the ending of this.

1372
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,860
Like... like just taking it out for a walk.

1373
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,300
I didn't even know about the curse mode.

1374
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,460
I love how they gave... they gave Coco a dog tag.

1375
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,480
And a collar.

1376
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,500
And it's named Coco!

1377
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,980
The dog tag is named Coco!

1378
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,020
Oh!

1379
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,500
No!

1380
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,080
Oh god it's...

1381
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,620
The poor dog!

1382
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,320
The poor dog!

1383
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,180
And then look at the eyes.

1384
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,020
That is so rad.

1385
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,060
That is so rad!

1386
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,260
That was awesome!

1387
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,500
That was so cool!

1388
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:35,760
That was like...

1389
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,020
Ah!

1390
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,100
I'm the propaganda dog.

1391
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,900
So rad.

1392
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:43,740
I like it.

1393
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,580
He likes it.

1394
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,220
It's like a real dog.

1395
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,300
This guy has infected his internet.

1396
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,300
Be used later for protection and security when they put a gun attached to it.

1397
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,660
The new protection.

1398
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:01,680
Oh my god!

1399
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:01,960
Look!

1400
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,160
He's picking up the bus!

1401
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,780
It's like a real dog!

1402
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,480
Gesellschaft.

1403
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:07,920
He's a dog!

1404
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:10,480
Go go!

1405
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:11,560
Go go!

1406
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:11,940
Go

1407
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,090
go!

1408
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,650
Guo Guo!

1409
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:22,170
Isn't it?

1410
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,290
A beautiful family.

1411
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,590
Thanks again to A ideological.

1412
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:26,450
So beautiful!

1413
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,910
But yet, anyway I...

1414
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,310
All I'm saying guys...

1415
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,150
All I'm saying...

1416
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:39,570
All I'm saying is that I will 100% invest in this.

1417
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,970
All I'm saying is that I will 100% invest in this.

1418
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:52,330
This is the TikTok video I saw.

1419
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,580
I feel like this was worse.

1420
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:58,540
Like...

1421
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,860
This is a lot worse.

1422
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:05,800
Oh, look at this!

1423
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,040
It taught your cat to play piano!

1424
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,620
Look at this!

1425
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,520
Oh my god!

1426
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:32,250
I bet you the Furby dog can learn piano faster than this cat.

1427
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:34,670
It's so cute!

1428
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:36,950
Look!

1429
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:37,890
He's learning!

1430
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,430
His brain is expanding!

1431
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,130
Eat Bobo!

1432
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,190
He's playing on his own!

1433
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,170
That's so cute!

1434
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,110
Oh my god!

1435
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,190
Anyway, I felt like you guys needed that to...

1436
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,870
We needed the cleanser for that.

1437
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:02,170
Also, I was watching people make school lunches.

1438
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:09,310
Okay, I was watching somebody watch the school lunch shit, but I've also watched actual parents making school lunches.

1439
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:11,210
And I'm just like, holy shit!

1440
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,350
The amount of effort and time.

1441
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,010
Look at this!

1442
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,550
We're gonna watch somebody reacting to this.

1443
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,430
I'll get the actual channel.

1444
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,110
So we can watch this.

1445
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:24,610
We don't react to the person reacting.

1446
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,590
I was like looking at her making school lunches.

1447
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,370
And I'm like, Jesus!

1448
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:35,490
Oh my god!

1449
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,690
She does so much too!

1450
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,910
Reacception!

1451
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:40,470
Like, look at this!

1452
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:41,770
Oh my god!

1453
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,010
Whoops!

1454
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,090
I forgot to put it in a playlist.

1455
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:52,090
Like, she has like... there's like different stuff like bath times and like she does...

1456
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:56,170
like DIYs for like her daughter and stuff like that.

1457
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,390
And I'm like, oh my god!

1458
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,070
That's like so much effort.

1459
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,910
My mom just buys stuff.

1460
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,410
Okay, wait, let me show you guys.

1461
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,210
Uh, alright, where's my playlist?

1462
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:12,070
Where's my liked videos?

1463
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:12,870
There it is.

1464
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,830
Alright, here.

1465
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:17,230
I was like... the commitment to this.

1466
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,130
Ugh.

1467
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,990
She has a whole drawer for like her kids.

1468
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:26,090
Like, this is just dedicated to making food for her children.

1469
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:27,670
What a mom!

1470
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:45,820
Like, she has like... like there's like... there's a lot of these channels of like moms making school lunches or like just like lunch and dinner for their children.

1471
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:51,180
And like one of the moms like showed their fucking collection of cookie cutters.

1472
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,520
It was actually crazy.

1473
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,560
They had like... they had like, oh I think like a hundred cookie cutters for different themes.

1474
01:10:58,940 --> 01:10:59,500
Like, I don't know.

1475
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,440
Like, the budget for this?

1476
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,540
Not gonna lie.

1477
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,160
Okay, this is fucked up for me to say.

1478
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,320
Uh...

1479
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,140
This is... this is so fucked up for me to say.

1480
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:18,860
But like, I feel like she could buy healthier foods for their child.

1481
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:26,760
Um, like that's tastier for like one third of the price of all this stuff.

1482
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,300
She has!

1483
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:34,680
Like...

1484
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,180
It's like, look, because you need two cookie cutters?!

1485
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,560
And look at all this!

1486
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,080
Oh my god.

1487
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,020
That's a lot of seasoning.

1488
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,820
Oh my god.

1489
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,580
Like, she has like a snack drawer too.

1490
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,400
And then like a container for Cheez-Its?

1491
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,490
Anyway, she does like...

1492
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:06,510
She's like, she's like, she's like...

1493
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,370
But it's crazy.

1494
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:09,690
She's like so dedicated to her child.

1495
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:11,210
Because...

1496
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:16,150
Because she made like her own bakery for her child.

1497
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:17,950
I'm like, oh my god.

1498
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,390
She's so creative.

1499
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,710
That shit is so bougie.

1500
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:34,390
She doesn't know how to sew but look at what she made!

1501
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:38,450
I finished my first felt macaroon.

1502
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:41,470
It was in that moment that I was overcome with emotion.

1503
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,710
Even though I was making all of this for my daughter.

1504
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:47,330
My inner child was telling me thank you.

1505
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,890
For being the mother that I never had.

1506
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,610
So I'm like...

1507
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:54,650
I'm like, I want a mini bakery!

1508
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,930
I want a mini...

1509
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:57,850
Oh my god!

1510
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,070
This child...

1511
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:01,890
Look at this!

1512
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:02,970
WTF?

1513
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,490
This child gets her own mini bakery?

1514
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:07,010
Bakery!

1515
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,410
Oh my god!

1516
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:16,110
I wanna be this fucking parent's child!

1517
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:18,410
Look at this!

1518
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:22,770
This screams of mommy issues.

1519
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,110
It's not fair.

1520
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,990
And then there's...

1521
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,190
For my daughter's lunch today, we are doing a deconstructed mommy...

1522
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,610
What the fuck?!

1523
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,650
Look at all these cookie cutters!

1524
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:44,490
That's what I'm saying!

1525
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:51,770
There's another... I actually subscribed to this other mom channel that makes lunches for their kids.

1526
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,510
And like, it's more than this.

1527
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:55,590
She has so many cookie cutters.

1528
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,610
It's actually crazy.

1529
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:02,750
This lunchbox is perfect for this meal because it contains a thermos compartment that will keep the noodles warm.

1530
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:05,870
First up are turkey dogs, broccoli, and a pitted boiled egg.

1531
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:06,490
And the cute little...

1532
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,190
This child is definitely an only child.

1533
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,390
Oh no, for real.

1534
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,930
No, she is definitely...

1535
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,110
And of course, our spoon and fork.

1536
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:18,530
I know some of y'all love to drag my lunchbox ideas...

1537
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:20,590
There's a mini... do you see that mini Heinz?!

1538
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,590
Is that mini Heinz?!

1539
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:23,990
What is that?!

1540
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,050
Like a swi...

1541
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:27,390
It's so tiny!

1542
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,110
They come in that size?!

1543
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:31,530
...to drag my lunchbox ideas.

1544
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:35,130
So for clarification, this is a loose interpretation of a ramen bowl.

1545
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,090
A mini soy sauce.

1546
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:36,250
And literally.

1547
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:39,250
My four year old is my harshest critic, so if she loves it, that's all.

1548
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,430
Oh my god she...

1549
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:42,570
No, no, you are not using her Amazon link!

1550
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:50,410
Anyway, so there's like... these are the things I watch, by the way.

1551
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:52,870
I don't like critique it as harsh as this.

1552
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:56,030
It's just like, I'm just watching it and I was like, oh my god.

1553
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:01,590
Here I am ordering Uber Eats while she makes a fucking...

1554
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,410
Like Mona Lisa lunch for her child.

1555
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,470
No free advertising.

1556
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:13,230
Alright, where's this other one I want to show you guys?

1557
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:14,610
Uh...

1558
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:15,870
Oh, look at this!

1559
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:16,370
Okay, okay.

1560
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,150
Look at it.

1561
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,050
Where is it?

1562
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:18,810
There was like...

1563
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:19,570
Did you guys know?

1564
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:20,910
Okay, at one point...

1565
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:25,250
My algorithm was filled with like Lego builders.

1566
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,230
And like, there was like this...

1567
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:29,350
Apparently there's like custom Lego blocks.

1568
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:30,790
Where is it?

1569
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:31,450
I was...

1570
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:33,710
I got recommended some like custom Legos.

1571
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,250
I was like, what the fuck?

1572
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,310
Oh wait, here you go.

1573
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:53,030
I looked at the website and like...

1574
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:58,330
In this bag we have an Amazon Prime box and a custom military helmet.

1575
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,290
I also got this very strange long head.

1576
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,690
I love the long head ones.

1577
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,690
I actually sort of want the long head ones.

1578
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:05,490
I don't know what these guys are, but they look funny enough.

1579
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:06,030
Um...

1580
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:08,090
Here we have this guy with an extremely tiny face.

1581
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,110
Look at his tiny face!

1582
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,930
I also got this weird double faced head.

1583
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,970
And also this drunken long clown face.

1584
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:16,210
I also bought this calculator with a hidden message when you flip it upside down.

1585
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,130
Too bad I can't read.

1586
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:18,250
Here's this cracked phone.

1587
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,130
A US passport.

1588
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:19,970
A bounce trap.

1589
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:22,030
I also got this oddly chilled sock monkey.

1590
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:23,850
A snack people were eating for some reason.

1591
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:24,910
Here's a magic 8-Ball.

1592
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,370
Here we have an innocent video tape.

1593
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:27,630
Lastly, a pouch of blood.

1594
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,270
It's so cool.

1595
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,070
What the fuck?

1596
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,890
Guys, there's like this channel.

1597
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:33,690
There's like this...

1598
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:41,190
Anyway.

1599
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,870
Anyway, so there's this channel.

1600
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:45,390
What do you see in this picture?

1601
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:46,750
By the way, there's like this channel.

1602
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:48,870
I didn't watch the ending of that.

1603
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:49,850
I just need you guys to know.

1604
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:52,250
I just saw the Star Scream and I thought that was cool.

1605
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,250
I didn't watch the ending.

1606
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:55,890
Okay.

1607
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:02,270
So like...

1608
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,670
There's like the...

1609
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:09,770
These random Russian channels... I don't know if it's like... I can't tell if it's deepfake or not.

1610
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:16,150
But like I think it's deepfake because people are like debating... debating it in comments.

1611
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,590
And... oh sorry Megatron.

1612
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:24,370
People were debating about it in like comments.

1613
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:32,010
Whether or not these are like deepfakes or actual... or like actual...

1614
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:36,430
Like... what's it called?

1615
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:37,510
Doppelgangers?

1616
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:40,850
But like there's like three of them.

1617
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:41,870
Like four of them.

1618
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:43,790
There's one of like Leo.

1619
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:48,410
There's one with the Wednesday girl actor.

1620
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,630
The other one was... what's her name?

1621
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:51,490
The Barbie actress.

1622
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,170
And then the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

1623
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,010
Factory actor.

1624
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:57,670
But it's actually so crazy.

1625
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,630
They all have the same name too.

1626
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:02,830
And it's like some Russian... some like Russian channels.

1627
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,050
Let me check.

1628
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:04,710
I'll show you guys.

1629
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,590
It's actually crazy.

1630
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:06,750
I was like what the fuck?

1631
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,510
Um... let's see.

1632
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,530
I'm pretty sure it's deepfake.

1633
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:13,190
I think it's deepfake.

1634
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,470
But like they have like... they have several.

1635
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,190
It's actually crazy.

1636
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:19,610
They have like so many different channels.

1637
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:24,110
Yeah it says fake but like people don't know if it's like...

1638
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:26,150
actors like that just looked like them.

1639
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,650
Or like actually...

1640
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:32,550
uh... if they're actually just like deepfakes.

1641
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:33,770
Cause like look at this.

1642
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,910
Okay not like this.

1643
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:42,510
I keep forgetting to like the videos cause I did the format like that.

1644
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,110
Like look.

1645
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,810
This has to be deepfake.

1646
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:51,670
Right?

1647
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:53,290
Right?

1648
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:55,310
That's deepfake right?

1649
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,890
That has to be deepfake right?

1650
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:00,450
I can't tell!

1651
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:01,810
It's so good!

1652
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:11,370
It's actually cra... technology is like crazy now.

1653
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:15,170
And it's so hard to tell these days if it's deepfake or not.

1654
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:16,670
What is this?

1655
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:17,550
Now I'm scared.

1656
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,190

He's so talented.

1669
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,040
I was like watching a lot of his videos.

01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,900

Look!

1675
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,120
He made...

1676
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,400
He made that with his hands!

1677
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,960
What the hell?

1678
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:10,620
What the...

1679
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,080
Holy shit!

1680
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,640
It's like survival game crafting.

1681
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,480
Like he made all of this!

1682
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,720

1684
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,080
Okay wait let me show you his channel.

1685

It's actually... I like love his work.

1686
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,320
I recently discovered his stuff.

1687
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,600
Um...

1688
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,420
But... uh... like there's like a...

1689
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,760
Slower version of it.

1690
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,720
But he does like... um...

1691
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,160
Figure mods and stuff too.

1692
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,460
So... uh... oh this one.

1693
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,080
This one's good.

1694
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,360
I mean...

1695
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,240

1696
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,220
I mean like some of the stuff he made.

1697
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,860
There's like... he does like... lots of like minor...

1698
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,940
Like not minor but huge mods.

1699
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,820
On figures.

1700
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,180
Like... oh my god!

1701
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,940
I saw the dragon one and I was like...

1702
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:56,780
Holy fuck!

1703
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,620
The dragon one was...

1704
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,380
Was so talented.

1705
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:03,820
Like videos...

1706
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,540
Uh... watch this.

1707
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:06,580
Let's kill him!

1708
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,620
Look at that.

1709
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,420
Oh my god he carved all that out of a fucking styrofoam.

1710
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,420
Like he carved...

1711
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:24,980
Skills!

1712
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,100
He actually carved...

1713
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,700
Skills out of a fucking styrofoam!

1714
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:49,370
Yeah he's making the dragon!

1715
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:52,330
What the fuck the head?

1716
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:58,010
Get this guy a 3D printer!

1717
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,150
Like...

1718
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,640
This is styrofoam!

1719
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:07,610
Like... this is styrofoam!

1720
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,510
This is better than 3D printer!

1721
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:10,350
This is better than 3D printer!

1722
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:10,710
This is better than 3D printer!

1723
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:11,510
Bro this is handmade!

1724
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:14,230
He don't need...

1725
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,630
Yeah he is the printer!

1726
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:16,630
Guys!

1727
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:19,610
This man is the fucking 3D printer.

1728
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,590
This goes so hard!

1729
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,170
Like I recently discovered his channel.

1730
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:27,950
Like he...

1731
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:28,170
Like he...

1732
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,410
Not only can he make...

1733
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:32,210
Not only can he make like whole...

1734
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:34,790
Uh like props for his figures...

1735
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:36,790
But he can make a fucking figure himself.

1736
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,890
He doesn't even buy figures anymore.

1737
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:39,930
He can literally make them.

1738
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:42,230
What's the channel name?

1739
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:43,910
It's uh... Yoshi channel.

1740
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,550
Got a 3D printer!

1741
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:53,770
Hahaha Hahaha If you have any kind of stories you can take it again.

1742
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:55,510

The creative side of YouTubers can edit so well.

1748
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:13,430
The creative side of YouTubers can edit so well.

1749
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,890
Thank you very much.

1750
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:15,710
Oh so sweet!

1751
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:17,650

01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:31,070
Hahaha Hahaha I'm trying to find...

1756
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,130
Alright let's see.

1757
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,850
Oh this one I saw was pretty funny.

1758
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:39,230
I wish gender reveals were as fun as this.

1759
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:40,650
I wish gender reveals were as fun as this.

1760
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,600
You want a boy?

1761
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:52,180
Hahaha How is this normal?

1762
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:56,720
Hahaha This should be the norm for gender reveals.

1763
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,220
Dude I...

1764
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,720
Hahaha I'm tired of...

1765
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,160
Oh my god he did like the undertaker.

1766
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,980
Jokey police defied normal.

1767
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,680
This should be normal!

1768
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:16,400
I'm tired of all the force fires that are being started because of gender reveals.

1769
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,880
I'm so tired!

1770
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:20,760
Hahaha I'm so tired!

01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:23,080
And the cakes too!

1772
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,060
Cakes aren't original!

1773
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:28,060
Much less property damage.

1774
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:28,980
Exactly!

1775
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,880

I'm trying... There's like videos I've liked as well.

1785
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,580
I'm going to look through my archives.

1786
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,400
Oh my god I love watching these!

1787
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,480
So like these are like...

1788
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,440
Tours around...

1789
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,420
Like cool places in Japan.

1790
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,660
And there's one where it's like...

1791
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:08,320
Literally a town dedicated to dinosaurs.

1792
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:09,900
So like...

1793
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,620
I was watching this and it's like a whole train.

1794
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,900
That's just...

1795
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,760
Dinos.

1796
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:18,680
Hahaha It's like a dinosaur train!

1797
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,820
I thought it was so cool!

1798
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,140
I was like...

1799
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:23,940
This is so cute!

1800
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,180
I wanna be on this train!

1801
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,200
Name please?

1802
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,240
It's called...

1803
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,800
Itsuka Japan.

1804
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,020
Japan's largest dinosaur museum.

1805
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:35,120
It's so...

1806
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,060
It's so...

1807
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:37,100
Interesting.

1808
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,940
It's like...

1809
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:41,580
It's like those trains that are themed.

1810
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,500
So like there's like Pokemon themed trains.

1811
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,640
And like uhh...

1812
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,660
And like others.

1813
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,940
But this one's Dino themed.

1814
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:48,320
Look!

1815
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:48,780
Oh my god!

1816
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:49,820
There's a T-Rex head!

1817
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,560
I watched this video like a couple of weeks ago.

1818
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,480
It's so cool!

1819
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,040
So you ride this train to go to the museum.

1820
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,740
It's so cute!

1821
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,320
There's like so many interesting ones.

1822
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:04,900
And there's like...

1823
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:05,440
Oh this one.

1824
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,260
This one's scary.

1825
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,840
I wanna be on this train.

1826
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:11,940
Clever girl.

1827
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,560
He watched the pretty random videos!

1828
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,760
Hahaha Hahaha He watched the pretty random videos!

1829
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:24,100
Hahaha I just... I don't know!

1830
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:27,000
I'm very cultured I guess.

1831
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,800
I watch a lot of fucking random videos.

1832
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,200
I grew up on the internet.

1833
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,040
Finally a normal video.

1834
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:39,880
Hahaha My algorithm is like crazy.

1835
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,400
I just watch like different stuff.

1836
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:42,960
I'm not...

1837
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,440
I don't like just watch funny videos.

1838
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,480
I watch like craft videos and stuff.

1839
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,760
An insight into Doki's mind.

1840
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,680
Look at that!

1841
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,380
It's so cute!

1842
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,020
Oh what's the next to this?

1843
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,720
And then there's like a museum.

1844
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,640
It's just a museum dedicated to it.

1845
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,640
And stuff.

1846
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:05,060
So there's like dino themed food.

1847
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:05,840
And everything.

1848
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:07,800
And...

1849
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:09,540
What's this?

1850
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,240
Oh my god merch!

1851
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,460
Buy my merch!

1852
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,240
Anyway so I thought this channel was really interesting.

1853
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,740
I enjoy it.

1854
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,380
Cause they tour around Japan showing like interesting like themed places and stuff.

1855
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:20,760
And stuff.

1856
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,140
And then...

1857
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:22,620
Oh my god!

1858
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,660
Okay this is one of my favorite craft videos.

1859
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:26,900
Uhhhh...

1860
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,620
I don't know if you know this.

1861
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:32,880
They make like clay.

1862
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,820
Uh wuzu clay.

1863
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,220
I really enjoy their stuff.

1864
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,080
It's so cute.

1865
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,140
And very peaceful.

1866
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,800
They mostly do like Minecraft because of the algorithm.

1867
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:53,160
Hahaha Hahaha But I found the way they do like the clay art to be like really creative.

1868
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:05,590
Like I like the little like the template they use to help make the clay art.

1869
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,510
Minecraft IRL.

1870
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:09,710
Yeah that's what he does!

1871
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:10,990
So interesting.

1872
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,440
And they put this piece together.

1873
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:32,370
It's so peaceful.

1874
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,810
But you can see that it slowly becomes...

1875
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:35,910
Like look at that!

1876
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:37,790
Oh my god it's all coming together.

1877
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:44,810
It's very satisfying.

1878
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:44,970
It's very satisfying.

1879
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:49,350
What a submarine!

1880
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:51,430
It's a fucking Minecraft shipwreck.

1881
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:54,990
Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha

1882
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,550
And they're making the...

1883
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:14,170
Wait are they making the bottom face of it I think?

1884
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:19,930
Yeah so they're making the sand and the sand biome.

1885
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:23,970
So...

1886
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:25,790
So nice.

1887
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:26,130
So nice.

1888
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,070
Very relaxing.

1889
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:30,350
I can do that.

1890
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:33,010
Hahaha Yeah?

1891
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:36,470
Where's your 2 million subscribers channel?

1892
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:37,690
Where is it?

1893
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:38,490
Hahaha

1894
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,740
Oh my god it fits perfectly!

1895
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:53,860
I like how there's like Christmas background music in the background.

1896
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,020
Where's yours exactly?

1897
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,580
That is why I'm not talented enough.

1898
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,800
And I said I use people's content for React.

1899
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:11,320
Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha That's why I don't have 2 million subscribers.

1900
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,760
Let's go react at these.

1901
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,380
Wait what's that?

1902
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:22,480
What is...

1903
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,780
Oh that's the seaweed!

1904
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,320
Right?

1905
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,480
I haven't watched this video yet.

1906
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,240
I watched his other clay videos.

1907
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:33,800
Oh my god.

1908
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,800
Imagine like putting...

1909
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,700
Those could be like surgeon fingers too.

1910
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:42,540
I feel like instead of becoming a surgeon a lot of...

1911
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:48,440
It's either you be a surgeon with those with those like steady hands or like uh... or a crafter.

1912
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,680
Yeah the tiny details.

1913
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,560
And then the coral!

1914
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,380
Oh my god they're all broken!

1915
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,040
This could be because of the quality.

1916
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:05,500
Hahaha Look at that.

1917
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,720
It's so fucking tiny!

1918
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,300
Oh I love tiny kitchen.

1919
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:11,720
I watch their stuff too.

1920
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,600
I love tiny kitchen.

1921
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:15,980
Grab it!

1922
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Thank you for the tier 1 stuff.

1923
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,380
Thank you.

1924
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:17,960
Thank you!

1925
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,920
And the tiny sea pickles.

1926
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,020
And then the coral and the seaweed.

1927
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,520
And then the tiny boat!

1928
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,280
Oh my god with a chest!

1929
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,760
That's so cute!

1930
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,620
It's so tiny!

1931
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:36,660
It's so tiny!

1932
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,520
Oh my god there's Jack Black!

1933
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:41,680
Hahaha!

1934
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:43,140
Hahaha!

1935
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:43,660
Hahaha!

1936
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,320
Tony please!

1937
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,220
Hahaha!

1938
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,660
It's true!

1939
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,520
Jack Black's gonna be Steve in Minecraft!

1940
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,920
You guys didn't know that?

1941
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,500
It's so cute.

1942
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,080
Finally Jack Black is real.

1943
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,220
Oh the tiny axolotl!

1944
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:18,220
Yeah I'm serious!

1945
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,760
He's gonna be Steve in Minecraft!

1946
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,020
They just finished filming!

1947
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:29,480
Oh my god the axolotl is so cute!

1948
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:31,840
Oh!

1949
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,140
I love his stuff!

1950
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,480
And then you're gonna add resin.

1951
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,460
I love the crafting channels.

1952
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,420
They're so relaxing to watch.

1953
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:20,770
I love the crafting channels.

1954
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:21,690
I thought she was joking.

1955
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:23,090
Holy shit it's so tiny!

1956
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:25,250
Next to the Lego?

1957
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:27,910
I didn't realize how tiny it was!

1958
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,250
I didn't realize how tiny it was!

1959
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:39,210
And then you're gonna put resin on it.

1960
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:06,900
Wait they're making their own diorama!

1961
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,520
My god!

1962
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,380
They didn't even buy a diorama they made their own diorama!

1963
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:25,200
Oh god pushing that down would like make me so scared!

1964
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,700
Yeah they made their little wood stand!

1965
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,440
I'd be so scared pushing that down.

1966
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:41,560
And so they have to mix the resin.

1967
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:46,880
The thing about resin is that you have to, it has to be like 50-50 exactly.

1968
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,840
Because of chemistry.

1969
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,660
If it's not 50-50 exactly, you fuck up the resin.

1970
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:00,610
So good!

1971
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:03,570
And the air bubbles make sense because it's water.

1972
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,110
Holy shit!

1973
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,220
Are they gonna take out take off the uh...

1974
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,500
Are they gonna take out the glass part or are they gonna keep that in?

1975
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:22,520
Oh I guess they keep that in.

1976
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,780
It's so sick!

1977
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,360
I know!

1978
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:26,020
He's so talented!

1979
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,000
I love his stuff!

1980
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,840
Yeah you fuck up the resin and it's done for.

1981
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,120
You have to remake the whole thing.

1982
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,100
I know it's so good!

1983
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:34,080
I love his shit!

1984
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,280
I love his works!

1985
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:37,760
It's actually so good.

1986
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,480
Everything is like super precise and everything.

1987
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:53,460
Alright now that we're talking about crafting channel, let me show you guys another another craft person that I like to watch.

1988
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,480
Uhhhhhhh Let me see if I can find it.

1989
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,320
Let's see... where is it?

1990
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,440
I love watching craft channels.

1991
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,440
It's like my life.

1992
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,380
It's Wuzuklei.

1993
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:07,140
Oh there!

1994
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:10,000
I love these like Pokemon cards dioramas too.

1995
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,260
I think these are really unique.

1996
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,660
Like the 3D card dioramas.

1997
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,900
That stuff is... that's like...

1998
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:23,860
That's so pretty.

1999
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:26,940
Those are really cool.

2000
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:27,260
Yeah.

2001
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,660
And cause they need like multiple too.

2002
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,540
They need more than one card to make this.

2003
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,220
So they have to like...

2004
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,820
Like they want to use like authentic Pokemon cards.

2005
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:43,760
So like they have to make...

2006
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,380
Buy like multiple copies of it.

2007
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,680
I love Doll Life.

2008
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,580
Doll Life was one of my favorite doll creators.

2009
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:03,140
And also speaking of dolls cause I saw a lot of people like the Doki Bird doll drop from Moonlight Jewel as well.

2010
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:04,680
I love watching doll videos.

2011
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:10,140
But like the Doki Bird doll video dropped as well.

2012
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,880
I haven't watched it yet.

2013
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:16,360
Like oh look!

2014
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,760
Holy shit it's so pretty!

2015
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,320
I want...

2016
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:25,220
I want like a Doki Bird card diorama one day in the future.

2017
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:26,900
That's so pretty.

2018
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,420
Like oh my god it's so good.

2019
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:35,000
Alright before we do we should like watch something fucked up before we watch something normal.

2020
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:37,520
Hahaha!

2021
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:38,600
Hahaha!

2022
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:58,940
Man I wish I could show like some of the animation channels I watch but the humor in it is like really fucked up cause I told you guys like so my favorite animation channel is like there's Cass, there's Flash Gitz, uh and there's Meat Canyon.

2023
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,800
But like I feel like what if I show you guys hahaha!

2024
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,680
Hahaha!

2025
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:12,240
The humor's not for everybody but like those are that's my humor.

2026
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,160
Hahaha!

2027
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,340
That's technically my humor.

2028
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:17,700
Um...

2029
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:20,740
Let's see...

2030
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:21,140
Oh!

2031
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:27,400
I saw like this song for learning Japanese and I thought it was like um really cute.

2032
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,320
This is by...

2033
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:37,740
Let's learn Japanese today.

2034
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:39,340
Ah!

2035
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:40,400
Ah!

2036
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:59,750
For those who need to learn Japanese This is not actually helpful!

2037
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:00,710
Hahaha!

2038
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:01,950
Hahaha!

2039
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:10,930
Okay the reason why is that like I saw this version of it which was really nice.

2040
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:13,470
Um...

2041
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:15,170

This is how Doki learns Japanese.

2056
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:46,490
That's... that's cute that you think that I'm ever gonna learn Japanese.

01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:43,410
Like some of my favorite channels.

2085
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:45,810
Watching people make rugs.

2086
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:47,330
I don't know why.

2087
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:49,890
I just think it's like super soothing.

2088
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:52,470
It's so interesting too.

2089
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:55,610
The rug making videos.

2090
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,730
No, not the cleaning ones.

2091
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,690
I just watch people make rugs.

2092
01:40:58,890 --> 01:40:59,930
Like that's it.

2093
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:00,730
Hahaha!

2094
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:03,650
Hahaha!

2095
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:04,310
That's it.

2096
01:41:04,410 --> 01:41:06,050
I literally watch people make rugs.

2097
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:06,790
Hahaha!

2098
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:15,290
Oh, it's so nice too.

2099
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,970
The ASMR of it sounds so relaxing.

2100
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:19,190
Hahaha!

2101
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:23,090
It's so talented too.

2102
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:23,770
It's so talented too.

2103
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:26,310
Cause you have to be like super precise with everything.

2104
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:28,450
And look at that.

2105
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:30,910
And then trimming it all.

2106
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:38,130
And then making it so that like things are... making it so that these are more like bumpy than the others.

2107
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:41,470
Oh, I've seen the art restoration videos.

2108
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:42,590
Yeah, I have.

2109
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:44,610
Look at that.

2110
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,230
Oh my god.

2111
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:46,070
I want this rug.

2112
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:48,310
Can someone make a Doki Bird rug?

2113
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:48,870
Hahaha!

2114
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:49,810
Hahaha!

2115
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,030
Alright, let's watch the...

2116
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:55,190
Let's watch the doll video.

2117
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:56,330
I haven't watched it yet.

2118
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:58,750
Uh... I saved it though.

2119
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:00,530
Here it is.

2120
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:01,150
Hey ho!

2121
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:06,630
So if you guys have been watching me for a while, you probably know that I have made some Vtuber dolls in the past.

2122
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:07,130
As me!

2123
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:07,910
I'm a Vtuber!

2124
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,810
I love doll making videos.

2125
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:16,290
I thought how about I make another Vtuber doll before I'm taking a tiny break from posting.

2126
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:16,570
As me!

2127
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:17,430
She's talking about...

2128
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:17,930
Me guys!

2129
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:27,390
Amazingly enough, the decision who to make was made pretty easy when I saw that the amazing Doki Bird hosted a cherry stream and sent for artists... That's me!

2130
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:27,670
Doki Bird.

2131
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:28,870
to participate in that.

2132
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:33,170
The artworks and items that the artists offered would then be auctioned off and...

2133
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:33,430
As me!

2134
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:34,570
Doki Bird!

2135
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:41,330
So I applied, got accepted, and offered a slot of a custom Doki Bird doll that will go with... I'm sorry!

2136
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:42,150
Hahaha!

2137
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:45,350
Which is what we are going to do today.

2138
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:50,570
As always, Blue Pixie did an amazing job by already sculpting a beautiful face and some of her accessories.

2139
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,070
Those are mine!

2140
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:56,250
So how about we get my 3D printer and some resin prepped and start this project by printing the doll.

2141
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,440
Holy shit, what the fuck is that?

2142
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,100
What is that machine?

2143
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,200
Is that a 3D printer?

2144
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:15,840
Wait, what?

2145
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:18,900
Are 3D printers like that now?

2146
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:22,120
Oh my god, that has to be a fucking...

2147
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,420
Oh, it's a resin printer?

2148
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,460
They can 3D print resin now?

2149
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,260
Wait, that's insane!

2150
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,340
That has to be crazy expensive!

2151
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,440
Oh my god, those are my legs!

2152
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:40,900
Woah!

2153
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:41,420
Naked!

2154
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:47,860
I really love the little smug smile on her face and I'm happy that the printing and assembling went so well.

2155
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,620
And now that the preparations are done, we can now actually start working on it.

2156
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,520
Ah, it's Lute Tomato!

2157
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:53,640
Hashtag!

2158
01:43:53,640 --> 01:44:02,320
As a full time content creator, I have to make sure to stay always on top of the game when it comes to trends on social media.

2159
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:06,800
One recent trend that I picked up was people telling their own stories through short form content.

2160
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:08,420
I think the cat is coming.

2161
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:15,160
I wanted to learn more about this subject and then found this class from Haleaza Navarra.

2162
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:17,160
Okay, sorry, I'm gonna skip your ad.

2163
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:19,740
It's Skillshare.

2164
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:23,820
But like, her... she wrote a video about this.

2165
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:26,600
She reminded me of this other channel that I really like to watch.

2166
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:27,300
I think it's nerdy.

2167
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,960
It's also like a crafting channel too.

2168
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,120
Her personality reminds me of that channel.

2169
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:37,160
Where it's... I'm trying to remember.

2170
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,240
They make really cool gaming stuff as well.

2171
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:47,200
They once made a custom PC that was inspired by Cyberpunk.

2172
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:48,760
I'm trying to remember the name.

2173
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:50,000
We should watch some of their stuff.

2174
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:50,920
Nerdforge!

2175
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,200
Yes!

2176
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,740
I love Nerdforge!

2177
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,280
Nerdforge is one of my favorite channels.

2178
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:55,760
It's so cool.

2179
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:00,800
An essential item that I found recently for making wigs is this matte styling wax.

2180
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:03,500
Because with this you can really mold the hair into shape.

2181
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:04,100
It's amazing.

2182
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:12,520
To make Ducky's bangs a little more spiky, I thin out the hair by vertically cutting into them and then use the styling wax and heat to mold them in shape.

2183
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:16,320
The curling wand is an excellent tool for flattening down the hair as well.

2184
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:21,260
When I was satisfied with the look, I then proceed and glue, cut and style her heme bangs.

2185
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:27,240
The front of her hairstyle was actually not that easy to mimic, which is why I decided to start the wig with it this time.

2186
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:28,880
The heme bangs are kind of layered.

2187
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:29,660
Really?

2188
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:30,580
Is my hair that complicated?

2189
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:40,080
Once I was satisfied with the look on the front, I glued more layers onto the middle part on top of the head and then decided to use thinning shears to thin out the wigs.

2190
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,080
I love my skin because the skin suit is easier.

2191
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:44,600
And then also style them in place and then finally start on the back of the head.

2192
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:49,700
For the pigtail look, I will glue around here in the direction of the pigtails on the back of her head.

2193
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:53,140
Afterwards, it looks a bit messy and believe me, it was.

2194
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:57,140
But I basically just had to pull all the glued hair into a pigtail.

2195
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:04,840
And then for the final layers, I prepped a bunch of folded around glued wefts, which I now will be using to create all the parting lines on the wig.

2196
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:14,800
This was a lot of work and I've been working on the wig for the whole day already and it was evening and I was pretty tired so I did that off-cam and I'm sorry.

2197
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:16,360
Oh my god, look at all that hair!

2198
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,300
There's so many hairs too!

2199
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,420
Thank you for the rain!

2200
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,060
Thank you, thank you!

2201
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,340
Hello everybody!

2202
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,560
It's me, DokiBraid!

2203
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,600
I do the stream on the YouTube.

2204
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,760
But today I'm on Twitch because I'm going to react to Andy today.

2205
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:38,940
Oh my gosh, the ribbon is so cute!

2206
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:49,100
I actually did try to make Doki's head out of fabric.

2207
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:51,080
I failed miserably.

2208
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:57,440
So Blue came to the rescue here and sculpted Doki's head so I could then CD print it in resin.

2209
01:46:57,460 --> 01:47:01,260
And I then just have to simply paint it according to Doki's artwork.

2210
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,320
I love how flawless it looks.

2211
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:12,820
And we'll now also glue it to the wig so that it won't fall off and potentially break in worst case since resin is a little bit more brittle than filament and tends to break more easily.

2212
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:17,080
The finished wig looks so cute already and I'm really proud of the little bows.

2213
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,800
I'm not a fan of making pictures.

2214
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:19,580
The layers is actually so pretty.

2215
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:20,120
It's so well done.

2216
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,860
But I love how they look in the end.

2217
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:23,720
Let's paint Doki's face next.

2218
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:30,220
The pixie did such a nice job sculpting it that you can already tell by the sculpt itself that it is really Doki Bird.

2219
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,940
As always I'm giving the face some sheen with pearly shimmers.

2220
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:40,320
You can really go a bit overboard with them as sealing them with Mr. Super Clear later on will make them disappear a little again.

2221
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,020
I also add a little bit of blushing to different areas of the face.

2222
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:49,000
I know anime faces tend to look more flat so adding a little bit more blushing...

2223
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,100
I think that's like the hardest part with uh...

2224
01:47:52,100 --> 01:48:01,560
The hardest part with like painting figures is to make it not like one dimensional type deal and adding shading.

2225
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I think that's like the hardest part.

2226
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:11,020
I've seen so many like custom figures and stuff that like um... that like forget to do like the important parts of shading.

2227
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:13,980
Because it's so hard to make it look right as well.

2228
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:19,040
I then can finally go in with black acrylic paint and carefully line the lashes with it.

2229
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:23,780
Of course I also have to line Doki's cute little smug smile using some gouache paint.

2230
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:27,100
Mistakes can be carefully scratched away with an exacto knife.

2231
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:27,700
So cute!

2232
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:35,280
To give the eyebrows a little bit more of a blonde look I decided to use a little bit of pastel yellow on the middle of them and I really like the look.

2233
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:43,880
For the finishing touches of the face I'm using my favorite iridescent sparkly shimmers on her cheeks and forehead before sealing her off with final touch.

2234
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:43,900
I'm sparkly!

2235
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:49,860
To make Doki's eyes I made these tiny templates on my iPad and printed them onto some cardboard paper.

2236
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:53,740
I'm then taking my half sphere mold and will use the third biggest one.

2237
01:48:53,900 --> 01:49:00,980
Using some UV resin I drop one drop of it into the mold and then place the iris onto the resin upside down like this.

2238
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:05,960
I let it cure for a minute and then add some white UV resin that I mixed with some white resin pigment.

2239
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:10,040
I cure it again for about 3 minutes and then it's time to demold the eyes.

2240
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,760
And it's for me!

2241
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:12,800
Oh my god!

2242
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:13,060
Oh no!

2243
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:15,180
Nooooo!

2244
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:17,840
It's cloudy!

2245
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:18,500
Yeah!

2246
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:24,040
But don't worry we're here to rescue it because I can simply use some UV top coat and gloss it over.

2247
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,260
And to make the resin spread evenly... Chemistry!

2248
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:28,640
I can use a lighter and then cure it in my UV lamp.

2249
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:29,100
She's blind!

2250
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,300
I mean...

2251
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,980
I mean...

2252
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:35,300
I mean...

2253
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:35,840
I mean...

2254
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,640
Honestly, like, that's not a surprise.

2255
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:41,020
Oh my god!

2256
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:47,240
Her face already looks so much like Ducky so I absolutely cannot wait to make her outfit next.

2257
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:53,100
To make Ducky's outfit I actually really had to think how to even be able to realize it.

2258
01:49:53,180 --> 01:50:02,500
In the end I opted to make an underdress with the white top part and a layered skirt and then basically make a black dress topper separately.

2259
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,000
And of course then make the jacket, accessories and shoes.

2260
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:08,740
So how about we start with the underdress first.

2261
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,920
First let's make the skirt of Ducky's dress.

2262
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:16,920
Since it has three layers and little white strips on them, I decided to cut the strips from white fabric vinyl.

2263
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:21,460
I think fabric vinyl has such a nice and neat finish that I really enjoy using it.

2264
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:30,280
After cutting I just have to weed it out and here you can see I cut three ruffled pieces from blue fabric already and will iron on those vinyl strips onto them first.

2265
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:35,240
I'm just like thinking how expensive all the machinery for to make these custom dolls.

2266
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,600
Especially like resin dolls too.

2267
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:42,300
I'm just gonna cut the top and bottom top seams of the smaller strips by gluing them around.

2268
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:46,500
As you can see I also pulled in some gathering threads and now gathered the ruffles.

2269
01:50:46,680 --> 01:51:07,320
It was a bit tricky to do so but in the end they looked... Have you guys seen this fashion designer that does pop culture outfits inspired by movies and tv shows and cartoons and then she did one from the Rogers Rabbit the unrealistic expectations of women outfit uh...

2270
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,240
what's her name?

2271
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:12,840
that... what's her name?

2272
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:14,580
she did like uh...

2273
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,900
from Roger Rabbit uh... Jessica!

2274
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,100
Yeah, Jessica Rabbit.

2275
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,840
Have you guys seen that there's like this like youtuber.

2276
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:24,560
She does like very little uh...

2277
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:34,700
she does like... she doesn't upload a lot of videos um... but she she has like almost a million subscribers from the very few videos that she has uploaded because it's just so good.

2278
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,080
I'll show it to you guys later.

2279
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,320
It's actually insane.

2280
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,080
I saw the short of it and I watched the video.

2281
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:41,940
Wow!

2282
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:47,940
So I basically had to go back to the drawing board and try to figure out how to make this skirt look better.

2283
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:48,240
What happened to my dress?

2284
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,480
I ended up going with a pleated look instead.

2285
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,760
So I prepped some new strips for the skirt and cleaned them up.

2286
01:51:53,860 --> 01:52:01,420
Then I sewed the two bottom pleated parts to a tool strip and then attached the top You have to be like a mini... like you have to know how to do clothes for this.

2287
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,480
...according to the markings on the top pleated part.

2288
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:09,440
For the top part of Ducky's dress... People who know how to do like clothing patterns... I cut this white fabric piece and then I sewed it.

2289
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:17,600
I sewed it, pressed it, and then stitched it down like this so I can now pull in a little rubber band through the tunnel that we just created.

2290
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,560
If you have trouble threading in threads like this through needles...

2291
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:22,100
A lot of TH.

2292
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:28,740
You can just use some tape, attach it to the end of the thread, cut it into a tip, and then thread it through the needle like this.

2293
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,420
This is just such a good trick I learned recently that I had to share it with you guys.

2294
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:35,580
And then I just proceed and thread the rubber band into the top.

2295
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:43,680
When that was done successfully, I then add a gathering thread and then I just thread it onto the bottom part of the top piece and gather it to the length of the blue lower part of the top.

2296
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,380
I pin it together and sew it finished sides in.

2297
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:50,020
Afterwards, it looks like this and as you can see I already pinned the back parts into the dress as well.

2298
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:51,900
Oh that's the top part of my outfit!

2299
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:53,420
Sorry the popcorn's hiding it.

2300
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,980
And then I also just sewed them on good sides in.

2301
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:55,620
And boom!

2302
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:57,160
A cute cat appeared.

2303
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,640
A very important assistant I might say.

2304
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:08,560
Here you can see the finished skirt and now I can take the finished top part of the dress and pin it to the skirt before sewing the skirt and top together finished sides in.

2305
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:08,700
Wait...

2306
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:09,860
My cat at this point had enough of me in some sense.

2307
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,520
The ruffles turned out so pretty!

2308
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:13,920
She was however very interested in the glue cap.

2309
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:21,140
The sewn together dress looks like this and I now just have to pin together the back seam and sew it together about 2.5 inches.

2310
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,560
Leaving just enough of a gap for the closure.

2311
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:33,560
The finished dress turned out so good and you can see that even though I have been making dolls for years, sometimes I have to remake things in order to make them look better and more accurate.

2312
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:34,280
And that's okay!

2313
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:35,400
We learn from mistakes sometimes.

2314
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:35,420
That's amazing!

2315
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,720
Let's make the black topper that Docky wears on top of the dress.

2316
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:47,140
Next, I prep the fabric pieces with white vinyl strips already and will now sew together the sides of the fitter sewing and steaming seams.

2317
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:53,940
Then I will now attach the blue lining pieces on which I also iron on some white vinyl strips next.

2318
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:57,820
I place them onto the black parts good sides in and hem them on.

2319
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:03,460
When flapping around the lining parts, it really looks like Docky's dress and will close like this in the end.

2320
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:24,020
I already cut and prepped the skirt for the topper by cleaning up the bottom shoes and attaching it The hardest part with clothes, making clothes based off of anime characters, is that a lot of the clothes that people design for anime characters is very hard to make reality because they're not physically possible.

2321
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:29,800
So it's always super impressive that they're able to replicate it in real life.

2322
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:44,980
Last but not least, I will be gluing some tiny golden half-beats as kind of fake funnies to the front of the dress topper and also attach tiny golden stars that I have to repeat and paint the gold and some more half-beats to the bottom of the dress topper as well.

2323
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:49,600
With these final steps, the dress topper is done and I'm super happy how it turned out.

2324
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,620
It looks so much like Doki's outfit.

2325
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:58,760
I think especially the little details like the blue lining part with the white stripes really make it look very accurate to the original.

2326
01:54:58,880 --> 01:54:59,780
Yeah, art cares no more.

2327
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:00,460
Yeah, for gravity.

2328
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:07,580
For Doki's jacket, I first take the sleeves that I cut from grey cotton fabric and prep them by pulling and gathering threads on the top and bottom seams.

2329
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:16,800
I then gather the lower part of them and take these tiny little cuffs that I prepped by ironing them in half and now pin them to the gathered sleeve parts and sew them on.

2330
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:21,860
When done with that, the sleeves look really cute already and I can now also gather the top part of them.

2331
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:28,320
I then set them aside for a bit and first will sew on the facing for the raglan collar to the bodice of the jacket.

2332
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:29,780
Of course, I fray check the sleeves.

2333
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:39,060
People who can make like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts cosplay are very impressive, especially the shoes.

2334
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:42,340
The Kingdom Hearts shoes, they are not practical at all.

2335
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:46,020
And now I can finally take the prepped sleeves and sew them onto the bodice of the jacket with magic.

2336
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:54,360
Last but not least, I take my cat and general posture out of the way so I can show you that I just needed to close the sleeve and side seams of the jacket still.

2337
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,060
I pin them together neatly and try to match up all the seams.

2338
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:58,920
Can we make a Kingdom Hearts live action movie?

2339
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,640
That Disney approved?

2340
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:04,300
I can exactly determine where to place the black ribbon that Ducky has attached to the jacket.

2341
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:05,840
I heard that was like the hardest part.

2342
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,660
I pinned it before and now careful.

2343
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:08,180
Okay, sorry.

2344
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:10,440
This is off topic because someone mentioned Kingdom Hearts.

2345
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:16,300
You know how like the Smash Brothers trailer for Sora has no Donald and Goofy?

2346
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:19,440
Because getting Sora on his own was really hard.

2347
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,760
Getting Disney characters in Smash Brothers...

2348
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,740
Like, okay, this is the perfect cut by the way.

2349
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,060
The perfect angle for you guys.

2350
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:27,580
Uh...

2351
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,840
But if you notice...

2352
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:32,800
Um...

2353
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:41,500
If you notice in the Kingdom Hearts Smash Brothers reveal trailer, there's no Donald or Goofy at all.

2354
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,280
There's no reference to Donald or Goofy.

2355
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:50,640
And even then, getting the Mickey Mouse keychain on the keyblade was in itself incredibly difficult to do.

2356
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:54,060
Because, like, you know, Disney was like, I don't know.

2357
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:57,460
I can't really attach it to the jacket with my beloved.

2358
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:58,000
Uh-huh.

2359
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:04,040
The horizontal strip is the final touch and will attach to the opposite side of the jacket with a little velcro on the inside.

2360
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,800
That's why like Donald and Goofy doesn't exist in Smash Brothers.

2361
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:11,680
Or like there's no reference to Donald or Goofy in the... for Sora in Smash Bros.

2362
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:17,860
...designed into 3D is really difficult, but it's a challenge that I really enjoy conquering.

2363
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:19,200
Feels like mini cosplay somehow.

2364
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,860
Did I actually ever tell you that I used to cosplay back in the day?

2365
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,040
Pre-Moonlight Jewel times.

2366
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,860
Let's make Ducky's boots next.

2367
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:31,940
I cut the boot pieces from blue fabric already and first sewed together the front seam, but just about half an inch.

2368
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:37,980
After sewing and ironing it, it looks like this and I can now proceed to glue around the seam allowance of the upper boot part.

2369
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,520
I then take this strip I cut from white fabric...

2370
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,780
And Disney will fuck up the kingdom.

2371
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:42,340
Oh, absolutely.

2372
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:44,660
Disney has passed its prime.

2373
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:47,040
Unless it goes into another renaissance era.

2374
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:53,380
Disney is all about like corporate, uh, money, greed, slash greed now.

2375
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:55,820
Also, Disney, you wanna sponsor me?

2376
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:57,060
I take that back.

2377
01:57:57,100 --> 01:58:06,200
I then glue around the back seam allowance of the boot and instead of a zipper, totally not because I completely forgot to order some, I will attach an elastic fabric on the back of the boot this time.

2378
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:10,640
I first glue around the top seam of the elastic fabric and then pin it to the boot piece like this.

2379
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:11,940
By my silence.

2380
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:15,400
I will only sew it on along the blue part of the boot and glue the rest with contact adhesive.

2381
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,600
Afterwards, it looks really neat and it worked out pretty well.

2382
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:17,920
Ducky is but corporate greed now.

2383
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:18,500
Not yet.

2384
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:22,660
So, the next thing I need to do is close in the little bottom seam on the back of the boot.

2385
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:25,460
And after that was done, I turned the boot inside out.

2386
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:29,120
And finally, closed the rest of the front seam good sides in.

2387
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:30,100
I turned it inside out again to reveal the finished boot piece.

2388
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:32,420
When you see me sponsored by Disney, you would know.

2389
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,700
And now, I put it on one of the Lover Dogs to finish the boot.

2390
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,600
I cut a cardboard sole from an old cereal packaging and will now glue the bottom of the boot to the bottom of the cardboard sole like this.

2391
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:39,980
Oh my god.

2392
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:41,600
How is that not sensory?

2393
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,360
Cardboard sole is tough to say.

2394
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:43,880
No!

2395
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:46,080
For the shoemaces, I printed these guide boards that Bruce got.

2396
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,420
Why did she censor those?

2397
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:49,300
And now, I have to paint the toe caps with them black.

2398
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:54,340
I also prepped these tiny buffers I cut from PVC covered in silver vinyl on my laser cutter.

2399
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:57,900
And now, take tiny pleather strips and thread them through the buckles first.

2400
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:58,640
Oh my god.

2401
01:58:58,680 --> 01:58:58,800
The tiny buckles.

2402
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:03,340
As you can see, I attached one set of buckle straps to the boot already and will now do the same to the other.

2403
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:11,160
I simply attached them with glue and afterwards can finally glue the upper boot part to the shoe base using some woohoo all-purpose glue.

2404
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:13,640
Last but not least, I just attached a tiny golden star to the boot as well.

2405
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:14,860
I love how tiny this is.

2406
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:15,900
How tiny this is.

2407
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:16,700
The little stars.

2408
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:17,660
And with this last step, the boots are also done.

2409
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:28,980
I decided to make them from fabric rather than pleather because you can see that on Ducky's original artwork, the boots do actually have some wrinkles and I think the fabric choice resembles this perfectly.

2410
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:31,600
Alright, the main part of the outfit is done.

2411
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:33,620
Let's make all of Ducky's accessories.

2412
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:38,020
For her stocking, I will be using an extra human kite with stripes like this.

2413
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:38,300
Ohhh!

2414
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,860
Cut out the stocking pattern from it.

2415
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:41,760
I then clean up the other seam with glue.

2416
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:42,980
That's so like smart and convenient.

2417
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,420
That's so resourceful.

2418
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,140
Not wasting materials.

2419
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,120
Afterwards, it looks like this.

2420
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:52,640
Cause you can like, you know, if you want to make more stocking you just get the same material.

2421
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,580
Did you even intend it?

2422
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:23,780
I didn't even know my boots were made of fabric, guys.

2423
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:29,880
Remember I said it's all about aesthetic instead of practicality?

2424
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,120
That's what I mean.

2425
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:32,140
I didn't even know.

2426
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,340
I learned something new today.

2427
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:36,140
I was like, whoa, my boots are fabric?

2428
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:39,880
To really bond the two components, I use a little metal roll.

2429
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:41,240
It's a really nice tool for that.

2430
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:44,840
I proceed and cut the tiny back pieces from the material off-cam.

2431
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:51,000
And now first attach some glue to the back inside of the bag to be able to attach the little side strip to it.

2432
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,040
Afterwards, I attach the front piece in the same fashion and end up with this little bag.

2433
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:57,440
Oh, it's a bag!

2434
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:00,220
It's a bag for all my seaming tools.

2435
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,240
I don't know if you guys know this.

2436
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,420
I'm a thief, by the way.

2437
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:10,120
I don't know if you guys forgot or not.

2438
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:12,620
I decided for a small magnet as a closure.

2439
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:18,120
I glued it to the top part already and now will attach the bottom magnet as well with some super glue.

2440
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:20,800
When it was dry, the bag opens and closes nicely.

2441
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,520
Yeah, it's like where I put all the tools to do the thieving things, you know?

2442
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:26,160
Like the thief tools.

2443
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:30,760
Yeah, I'm thinking what tools do thieves use?

2444
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:33,420
You know, thieving stuff.

2445
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:39,680
You know, those tools.

2446
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,420
Correct.

2447
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:45,940
Last but not least, I added these teeny tiny decorations to the bag as well with some glue and tweezers.

2448
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:48,880
And finish off the little leg bag like that as well.

2449
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,820
Only one more accessory to make.

2450
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:51,600
The gloves!

2451
02:01:51,940 --> 02:02:00,960
For these, I simply take a folded and cleaned up rectangle cut from jersey fabric and will sew them along the short seam, just leaving open a tiny gap for Ducky's thumb.

2452
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:03,600
Kind of the same way I made Iron Mouse's gloves back in the day.

2453
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:10,140
I can then simply put them into the hands like this and I really love this easy but nice technique of making fingerless gloves for my dolls.

2454
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:14,440
And with that, all the accessories for Ducky Bird's doll are finally done.

2455
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:17,820
Making accessories is definitely my favorite thing to do because cracking a sock...

2456
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:19,120
50% done with those gloves.

2457
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:21,100
...is something that I've been loving ever since I was a kid.

2458
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:23,700
I'm especially proud of that little leg bag.

2459
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:26,960
Okay, so the doll is actually done at this point.

2460
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:29,840
But for those of you who know me, you probably know that there is still some more to go.

2461
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:30,440
Best piece ever.

2462
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:31,900
Exactly.

2463
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:32,940
The doll stand.

2464
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:35,780
I have conveniently vectorized the logo already.

2465
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:39,800
So how about we make that stand now with a final little montage.

2466
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:55,740
Oh, it's so pretty!

2467
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:57,060
That's like my logo!

2468
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:01,480
Oh my god!

2469
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:03,780
Wait, that's the stand?

2470
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:06,920
Oh, I love it!

2471
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,840
Like the laser cut of the acrylic.

2472
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:14,180
And with that, the doll stand is also done.

2473
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,800
And I can finally assemble the doll completely for the first time.

2474
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:23,000
And I was absolutely blown away by how cute she turned out to be.

2475
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:23,500
Oh, that's me!

2476
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:24,520
Ducky!

2477
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:25,740
Ducky Bird!

2478
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:28,600
She called me cute!

2479
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:31,560
Oh my god, guys, I just put her together and she is everything.

2480
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:34,260
But I know, you're probably dying to see her.

2481
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,020
So, presentation time!

2482
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:36,640
Yay!

2483
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,220
Ducky Bird's rear!

2484
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,320
Bro, you can barely tell which one is the real Ducky Bird!

2485
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:01,800
Which one is it, guys?

2486
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:02,420
Can you tell?

2487
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:07,060
Who will you shoot?

2488
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:21,480
The hair is so long!

2489
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:23,400
Oh my god!

2490
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:26,540
Shoot the right one!

2491
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:30,200
Who's talking?

2492
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:31,080
You'll never know!

2493
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:34,440
It's so cute!

2494
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,060
I love how it came out!

2495
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:37,680
Oh my god, I love like the hair!

2496
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:39,800
The hair is like so well done.

2497
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:41,880
With all the layers and everything.

2498
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:46,240
That's actually so cute!

2499
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:51,540
And here is my finished Ducky doll and I hope you love her as much as I do.

2500
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:55,280
I also hope her new owner will be super happy with this doll as well.

2501
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:55,760
The new owner?

2502
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:56,080
Me.

2503
02:04:56,340 --> 02:05:00,940
As I said in the intro, I will be going on a tiny little break because I'm actually getting married.

2504
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:02,680
Oh, wait, sorry.

2505
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:04,840
I did not mean to fast forward that part where you get married.

2506
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:05,540
I'm so sorry.

2507
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,180
That was an accident.

2508
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:09,320
Congratulations on the wedding!

2509
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,520
Congratulations to the wedding!

2510
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:15,300
Oh my god!

2511
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:18,420
Yeah, but I'm getting one of the dolls.

2512
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:22,520
And also like the person who won the auction is getting the other doll.

2513
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,200
That's so cute though!

2514
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:27,720
Oh my gosh, huge shout out again to Moonlight Jewel.

2515
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:28,960
I love their work.

2516
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:30,520
I remember watching their work before.

2517
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:31,860
In the past.

2518
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:38,040
So I was so surprised when she contacted us saying that she wants to make a doll of me for the charity.

2519
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,220
And like a huge shout out for them.

2520
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:42,660
It was really nice of them to...

2521
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,940
Well, I paid them by the way.

2522
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,820
So it's not like she did it for free.

2523
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:51,140
Because I feel like, you know, obviously all the artists need to be supported.

2524
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:59,760
And I was so happy that she offered her services for the charity auction.

2525
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,580
And I'm so happy to receive one of the dolls!

2526
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:07,220
I get to receive a Doki Bird doll!

2527
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,120
Alright guys, let me show you guys.

2528
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,420
Okay, the Jessica Rabbit outfit.

2529
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:14,720
Okay, Jessica Rabbit fashion.

2530
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,960
I was like, oh my god.

2531
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I think this one, making a Jessica Rabbit.

2532
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:21,400
Okay, this, oh my god.

2533
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:26,100
Yeah, she has like 148 million views on this.

2534
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,060
I feel like you guys must have seen this.

2535
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:32,520
It's actually insane how talented she is in fashion.

2536
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,500
Here.

2537
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,660
Picking an hourglass body.

2538
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,400
Like what the f***?

2539
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:47,520
You

2540
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:52,780
can do that?

2541
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,300
Like, oh my god.

2542
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:02,960
How?

2543
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:04,960
Like what?

2544
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:11,560
She went from an A to a D.

2545
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:20,000
My ribs hurt.

2546
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:24,740
No, the thing is, she didn't even do so much.

2547
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:27,800
D for Dab.

2548
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:29,300
Like look.

2549
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,640
All she did was just pat it up.

2550
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:32,520
It was just illusion.

2551
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:36,280
She got some foam and patted the f*** out of her ribs.

2552
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:40,820
And then she got like four f***ing bras.

2553
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:47,860
Life is a lie.

2554
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:49,440
It's all pads.

2555
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,780
I love her stuff.

2556
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:53,460
She doesn't even have that many videos.

2557
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:56,560
But she, her, like look at how many videos she has in general.

2558
02:07:57,640 --> 02:08:01,940
But she already has three, almost three million views.

2559
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:06,180
Because of like how talented she is as a fashion designer.

2560
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:08,180
Like, oh my god.

2561
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,160
Like...

2562
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:15,180
Okay, I know we're going for like an extreme look.

2563
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:16,260
Like, look!

2564
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:17,120
You're right!

2565
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:17,580
Ah!

2566
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:19,460
Ah!

2567
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:20,280
Ah!

2568
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:20,620
Ah!

2569
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:21,040
Ah!

2570
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:21,320
Ah!

2571
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:21,640
Ah!

2572
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,400
Ah!

2573
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:22,620
Ah!

2574
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:22,940
Ah!

2575
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:24,040
Ah!

2576
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:26,220
Ah!

2577
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:27,580
My name is Shay and I like to make things.

2578
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:31,480
And this week I'm telling you how I made my Jessica Rabbit costume into a dress.

2579
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:31,960
Okay.

2580
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:35,640
Before I can even f***ing go for it, I'm vaguely following these two tutorials.

2581
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:37,640
But I'm just going to kind of wing it.

2582
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:39,400
I should do this?

2583
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:46,860
Wrap yourself in saran wrap, drawing on two little like chicken leg hip shapes, and cutting it all apart to get your pattern.

2584
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:48,600
I cut a hole in my shirt.

2585
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,440
This could be you guys, Jaagons!

2586
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:54,040
You can add this for your butt!

2587
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,620
But... you guys wanna like have more ass?

2588
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,920
Add like these pads behind your butt.

2589
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:04,120
Thick?

2590
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:05,060
I could be thick!

2591
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:06,920
You guys can be thick too!

2592
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:07,900
No!

2593
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:17,240
No more squats guys!

2594
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:17,940
Look!

2595
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,740
Holy sh- Look at that!

2596
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:21,480
No more squats!

2597
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,240
Just add pads!

2598
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:28,420
But I think this is far too extreme even for Jessica Rabbit.

2599
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:31,780
So the hips looked good but they were way too big for my body shape.

2600
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:34,880
So I'm doing take two this time with two inch foam.

2601
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:36,820
Last time I used four hips.

2602
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,320
So this is what it looks like with the corset.

2603
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:40,740
I think it's a good shape.

2604
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:45,780
I think it's still very like hourglass without being as crazy as it was before.

2605
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:53,620
Holy sh- Okay, second one is definitely more natural than the second one.

2606
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:54,020
It's so good!

2607
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:57,760
It's definitely a lot more natural.

2608
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:03,540
Version one is a Disney.

2609
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:06,540
Version one is Dexter's mom.

2610
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,280
This is literally Dexter's mom right there.

2611
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,940
This is a Jessica Rabbit shape.

2612
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:18,120
Now all that's left to do is make the boobies.

2613
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:23,180
Stacking bras and stuffing them with socks is an a- It can ache.

2614
02:10:23,180 --> 02:10:23,340
A cup.

2615
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,360
Maybe a bee cup.

2616
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:28,060
But I have very little chest to work with in general.

2617
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:35,060
So for building my chest I really am trying to like push one out and then build the rest out with padding.

2618
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:38,100
First up is just normal push up bra that fits my size.

2619
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:39,620
This is from Victoria's Secret.

2620
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:41,720
As you can see it's not a lot but it's a little more.

2621
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:42,760
Make it a little bit more.

2622
02:10:42,980 --> 02:10:45,260
And then she adds a sec- Oh wait!

2623
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:46,880
She puts pads in there?

2624
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,280
Starting to get a little more.

2625
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:49,400
And then...

2626
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:50,940
And then bra number two.

2627
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:51,180
And then bra number two.

2628
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:52,980
How much does it accentuate?

2629
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:54,460
Oh my god!

2630
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:56,340
Is this how they do that?

2631
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,120
Holy shit!

2632
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:01,520
What do we want?

2633
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:02,440
Science.

2634
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:05,120
Damn!

2635
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,640
Magic!

2636
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:14,440
I'm living a fantasy.

2637
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:17,860
All foam.

2638
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:21,800
The power of layers.

2639
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:25,540
Chat is this real?

2640
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:28,540
Why don't you find out yourself?

2641
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,580
Buy four bras.

2642
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:34,920
And go even beyond the super chain.

2643
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:40,820
She's like forty percent foam.

2644
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,600
Holy shit!

2645
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:44,120
Alright, sponsored break.

2646
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:46,620
Okay, I need to like- What the fuck?

2647
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:51,620
Okay, I- The foam stays on.

2648
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:53,540
I'm gonna go get this chest.

2649
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:55,480
I'm gonna go just make sure it's support.

2650
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:56,200
I'm gonna get this chest.

2651
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:57,760
That's what we like, Jessica.

2652
02:11:58,140 --> 02:12:01,480
Not gonna lie, this is a lot more boobage than I thought it would be.

2653
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:01,900
Oh my god!

2654
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:04,100
This is so crazy.

2655
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:06,860
Bro, this is actually crazy.

2656
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:08,900
It's okay if it looks like it's falling out.

2657
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:10,720
Because that's kinda how her boobs are.

2658
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:12,300
She went too far!

2659
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:15,600
I'm working with- I kinda love it.

2660
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:17,020
I kinda love it.

2661
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:20,160
But now that we got the body, now that we got the dress- She kinda loves it, guys.

2662
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:24,400
Okay, and you're like- Okay, so this is the sequ- What the hell?

2663
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:25,040
Look at this.

2664
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:26,660
What the fuck?

2665
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:28,620
This is the same person!

2666
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:33,200
The world is- This is the same person!

2667
02:12:39,260 --> 02:12:40,780
That's actually crazy.

2668
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:43,140
She's so talented.

2669
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:47,160
I actually have to wear this costume- That's a free entran- Is this real?

2670
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:51,700
She looks amazing.

2671
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:54,180
Oh my god, this is the channel, by the way.

2672
02:12:54,660 --> 02:12:55,600
She deserves it.

2673
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:56,200
I'm not subscribed.

2674
02:12:57,820 --> 02:12:58,420
Because...

2675
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:00,100
Now I am.

2676
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:04,540
It's because she rarely uploads.

2677
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,160
This is the reason why.

2678
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:11,240
Like, whenever she does upload, it just pops up in my recommended.

2679
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:12,700
Whenever she does upload.

2680
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:17,080
Because it's so rare.

2681
02:13:19,380 --> 02:13:20,340
Alright, wait, wait.

2682
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:21,220
Okay, Dollifle.

2683
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,300
Not Dollifle.

2684
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:23,180
Nerdforge.

2685
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:24,340
I love Nerdforge stuff.

2686
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:28,140
Nerdforge stuff is like- I love her- Like, I love her builds.

2687
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:29,580
Um...

2688
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:32,720
But like, I'll show you guys.

2689
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,160
I'll show you guys the...

2690
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:35,420
Uh...

2691
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:36,520
The...

2692
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:37,460
What is it?

2693
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:39,020
Which one is my favorite one?

2694
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:43,440
I think my favorite one has to be like her PC builds.

2695
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:46,880
When she turned- Oh yeah, she turned her PS5 into a Dwarven Kingdom.

2696
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:47,580
Look at this.

2697
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:49,140
Shadow Vader.

2698
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:51,460
I'm Martina and I have issues.

2699
02:13:51,740 --> 02:13:53,160
I've been waiting for my PS5 to be ready.

2700
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:53,420
I've been waiting for my PS5 to arrive.

2701
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,300
Which it did after months.

2702
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:59,580
But now all I can think about is how normal it looks.

2703
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:01,700
And I've been wanting to do things to it.

2704
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,940
But I keep telling myself, Martina, there's no need.

2705
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:05,580
I mean, it looks perfectly fine.

2706
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:07,080
Here, let's do that.

2707
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:11,100
Okay, so like, all she- She like- Obviously, foam is your best friend.

2708
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:16,000
But it's actually crazy that she turned it into some fucking Dwarven Kingdom.

2709
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:17,800
I love Nerdforge.

2710
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:19,240
I love the stuff she uploads.

2711
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:20,820
I'm not subscribed.

2712
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:21,340
Let me subscribe.

2713
02:14:22,700 --> 02:14:23,140
I'm not subscribed.

2714
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:27,120
I was subscribed, okay?

2715
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:29,200
Just not on this channel.

2716
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:31,720
Now I'm subscribed on this channel.

2717
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:39,920
I know it looks like I've done a lot here, but really all I've done is just cut some stairs.

2718
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:40,760
Cut some walls.

2719
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:41,880
Balsa, think about tier one stuff.

2720
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:42,260
Thank you.

2721
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,180
Way over here was foam, so it's not that bad.

2722
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:47,360
There are these big holes.

2723
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:49,260
I'm gonna create some spacers in here.

2724
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:51,460
And then try to cover up some of the cracks.

2725
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:52,260
Nerdforge.

2726
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:52,520
I can see.

2727
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:53,120
Oh, I see.

2728
02:14:53,380 --> 02:14:53,820
Here.

2729
02:14:54,620 --> 02:14:55,220
Nerdforge.

2730
02:14:57,700 --> 02:14:58,640
Look at that.

2731
02:14:59,420 --> 02:15:00,520
It's so cool.

2732
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:07,120
And now let's fill all of these little gaps here with some sculptable.

2733
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:12,040
It makes so many things with like, fucking foam.

2734
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:17,200
Like I mean like cosplay for armor was originally done by like Nerdforge.

2735
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:19,300
Oh my god, there's this channel I really like.

2736
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:20,540
That does like...

2737
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:22,960
That looks so much fun.

2738
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:25,740
D&D skits.

2739
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:27,500
I find it really funny.

2740
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,420
I'm trying to remember the name.

2741
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:33,760
Does anyone remember the channel name that does like...

2742
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,760
D&D skits?

2743
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:39,940
I'm trying to remember the name right now.

2744
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:47,320
All that work for a console that has no games.

2745
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:49,220
There's a lot.

2746
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:49,560
Yeah!

2747
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:50,240
Viva!

2748
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:50,640
Viva!

2749
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:51,840
The Dirt League!

2750
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:52,340
Yes!

2751
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:53,020
That one!

2752
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:53,560
Yes!

2753
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,700
That's one of my favorite channels too.

2754
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:56,780
I love their skits.

2755
02:15:57,060 --> 02:15:58,140
They're so fucking funny.

2756
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,040
It's going so fast.

2757
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:02,640
It's shaking.

2758
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:03,820
Poor William.

2759
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:05,020
Working so hard.

2760
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:09,360
All right, let me skip a little bit because I've seen this before.

2761
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:11,380
If you guys want to watch more, check out their channel.

2762
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:15,120
But like... Oh my god, the painting too.

2763
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:16,600
All mixed up now.

2764
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,620
Hopefully it's good enough.

2765
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:18,660
Wait, okay.

2766
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:20,060
Start at the top here.

2767
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:21,820
I need to show you guys the finished product.

2768
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:25,660
This is like the electronics and stuff.

2769
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:28,080
Guys, skip, skip, skip.

2770
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:29,640
It's because I watched this already!

2771
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:35,920
If you want to watch like the full actual videos, check them out.

2772
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,380
Give them a subscribe.

2773
02:16:38,660 --> 02:16:39,660
Give them a view.

2774
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:41,860
Give Nerd Fortune a view, they deserve it.

2775
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:43,360
Holy shit.

2776
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:47,700
Would It Not overheat?

2777
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:48,740
Just don't play Cyberpunk.

2778
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:50,220
It's that easy.

2779
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:51,800
But we love this.

2780
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:53,260
I didn't watch it, sad.

2781
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:59,280
Support the original video, nerds.

2782
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:00,100
Exactly.

2783
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:05,060
Not true reaction, chat.

2784
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:08,920
How dare you, Doki, not leech off the entire video.

2785
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,580
Where's my real react, Andy?

2786
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,160
Thanks, thank you for the raid.

2787
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:20,360
Thank you, thank you.

2788
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:23,700
Hello everybody, my name is TokiBread.

2789
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:28,680
I usually stream on the YouTube, but today I'm apparently a failed react Andy.

2790
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:32,900
I'm a fake.

2791
02:17:39,330 --> 02:17:45,910
Holy shit, I love like, she's so good at like crafting and painting and art and everything.

2792
02:17:46,110 --> 02:17:47,310
She's so talented.

2793
02:17:49,130 --> 02:17:50,410
Fake reactor.

2794
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:57,870
How dare you not watch the entire video and steal all their content, Doki.

2795
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:58,750
What's the point?

2796
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:05,390
Are people this talented?

2797
02:18:06,290 --> 02:18:07,450
It's because they're you.

2798
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:16,890
It's because they actually, they actually like get up from their PC.

2799
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:24,850
Let's try to turn this on and see what it looks like for the first time and hopefully everything just works.

2800
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:31,360
Does it not work like the Xbox?

2801
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:34,320
Like you can turn it on and- Does it not work like the Xbox?

2802
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:34,980
No!

2803
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:37,200
She's almost perfect!

2804
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:42,880
She- Makes me feel like- stop, okay.

2805
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:44,960
It works!

2806
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:48,400
Thank you for gifting a tier one sub for both Doki and Kat.

2807
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:49,080
Thank you.

2808
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:51,680
Dude, all the LEDs look so good.

2809
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:52,860
Ho ho ho ho ho.

2810
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:57,560
The fake gamer shake my head.

2811
02:18:57,820 --> 02:18:59,780
The fake gamer shake my head.

2812
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:02,920
Long set.

2813
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:06,040
I don't want close up.

2814
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:06,820
Give me the close-up.

2815
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:08,940
Oh my god.

2816
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:09,500
Look at that.

2817
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:11,260
Holy shit.

2818
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:14,020
And that means that it's time.

2819
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:15,200
It looks so sick.

2820
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:18,220
It's like on your fucking desk.

2821
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:19,560
It's like on your fucking desk.

2822
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:20,620
Like holy shit.

2823
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:23,220
It could overheat.

2824
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:24,460
Just don't play Cyberpunk.

2825
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,580
Just play fucking Peppa Pig on this.

2826
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:26,960
Just don't play Cyberpunk.

2827
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:26,960
Just play fucking Peppa Pig on this.

2828
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:31,740
Looks so good though.

2829
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:39,420
That's a fucking PS5 guys!

2830
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:46,260
It's oozing lava!

2831
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:48,100

2833
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:57,100

2834
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:58,660
Okay yeah, wait.

2835
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:00,880
I'm not gonna watch this stuff but what was it?

2836
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:04,240
Viva La Dirt League.

2837

Check out... If you like Dungeons & Dragons, I highly suggest checking out this channel.

02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:25,020
I don't care about these.

2841
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:26,760
I don't care about these.

2842
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:27,820
The retail stuff.

2843
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:30,260
I just watch the Dungeons & Dragons ones.

2844
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:35,700

It was also a crafter channel.

2868
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:39,340
Like similar to Nourish Forge.

2869
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:43,040

2878
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:11,280
Thank God.

2879
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:13,040

2882
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:30,120
Oh, this one!

2883
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:32,880
Wait, is this the same one that made the...

2884
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:36,880
They made the... the Pokemon...

2885
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,160
No, not this one.

2886
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:41,440
There was like a channel that does like Pokemon crafts.

2887
02:22:41,780 --> 02:22:42,680
I really like.

2888
02:22:43,180 --> 02:22:43,820

2889
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:46,140

2890
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,640
I want to see if I can find it.

2891
02:22:51,740 --> 02:22:52,220
Oh!

2892
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:54,000
Is this one?

2893
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:56,120
Is it north of the...

2894
02:22:56,120 --> 02:22:57,720
Oh, north of the border is really nice.

2895
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:58,800
I love north of the border.

2896
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:00,840
Oh my God.

2897
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:05,720
North of the border is more like really fucked up dioramas.

2898
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:06,780
So...

2899
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:12,640
I'm scared of scrolling down because I saw what it was down.

2900
02:23:12,980 --> 02:23:14,680
But like it's for like more like...

2901
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:19,040
More like pretty dioramas because...

2902
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:23,720
If I scroll...

2903
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:24,220
Oh!

2904
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:27,800
Whoa!

2905
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:32,160
But I also enjoy their content as well.

2906
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:32,660
What is that?

2907
02:23:32,780 --> 02:23:33,280
Yeah.

2908
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:34,660
Yeah.

2909
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:35,540
Oh, yes!

2910
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:35,880

2911
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:37,940
It's the one with the Halloween ones.

2912
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,480
Halloween decoration DIY.

2913
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:43,900
I think I...

2914
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:45,100
Was it that channel?

2915
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:47,420
I'm trying to remember the channel's name.

2916
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:49,060
Was it Wicked Makers?

2917
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:50,140
Oh, I love this channel!

2918
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:52,260

02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:56,640
They like actually made like...

2921
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:03,740
They take like Halloween decorations and then like make them...

2922
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:05,060
Oh my God, this looks so good.

2923

They make...

2924
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:09,760
Remake them into like more like horror themed stuff, which is really cool.

2925
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:14,000
They take like super cheap Halloween decorations and like DIY it.

02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:15,380
Like look at this.

2927
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:16,260
Look at the...

2928
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:21,320
In this video, we're going to build a real catnap animatronic that actually breathes fog.

2929
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:24,100
Or Jamie and Jane, we bring your favorite monsters to life.

2930
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:25,380
Like this eight foot tall...

2931
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:27,080
Yeah, thank you for the three subscribe...

2932
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:28,740

2933
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:29,780
Thank you, thank you.

2934
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:30,500
Yeah, those are real.

2935
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,060
It's not even like 3D.

2936
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:32,880
Which is not easy.

2937
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:36,120
Catnap is the main boss in Poppy Playtime Chapter 3.

2938
02:24:36,220 --> 02:24:36,960
And it's...

2939
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:38,000
Well, just look.

2940
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:38,740
Just look at it.

2941
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:39,840

We're going to zoom in.

2944
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:46,380
If you guys want to actually check out the full video, let me subscribe.

2945
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:49,900
I swear!

2946
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,300
They are very cool.

2947
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:52,380
They're my favorite channels!

2948
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:56,140
Guys, I swear to God they're my favorite channel.

2949
02:24:56,660 --> 02:24:58,800
I used to be subscribed.

2950
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:02,280
I used to be subscribed on a different channel.

2951
02:25:06,380 --> 02:25:07,500
I swear!

2952
02:25:10,480 --> 02:25:11,980
I hope that's enough space.

2953
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:13,740
Oh wait, did they make this themselves?

2954
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:15,120
They've done it.

2955
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:16,820
Oh wait, they can...

2956
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:18,980
They're starting to make their own animatronics.

2957
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:19,880
Holy fuck.

2958
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:21,280
That's actually creepy.

2959
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:21,600
Crazy.

2960
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:24,520
They used to like just repurpose old animatronics for this.

2961
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:26,040
But like...

2962
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:28,260
But I wanna show you guys what's in it.

2963
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:31,240
Wait I'm trying to like show...

2964
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,360
Should we try it on?

2965
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:33,400
Holy shit.

2966
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,360
That shit's so creepy.

2967
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:37,640
Imagine having that like as a kid.

2968
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:38,580
Trick or treating.

2969
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:41,280
Imagine trick or treating as a kid and seeing this.

2970
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:42,580
Oh.

2971
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:43,100
Oh.

2972
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:44,800
That doesn't...

2973
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:47,780
Well the box worked but the whole thing started to collapse.

2974
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:49,920
We fixed it.

2975
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:52,200
We had to spread the legs out more.

2976
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:54,280
And they need to be in a very particular angle.

2977
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:56,940
Because the pose is so dynamic it doesn't balance otherwise.

2978
02:25:57,180 --> 02:25:57,760
But it works.

2979
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:58,080
And look.

2980
02:25:58,180 --> 02:25:59,360
We can even push on it.

2981
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:01,740
You know what though.

2982
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:02,660
I hate to say it.

2983
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:04,600
That box is expensive.

2984
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:06,280
That's not DIY.

2985
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:09,560
I know.

2986
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:09,560
I think it's...

2987
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:11,060
I took off a whole lot of material.

2988
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:13,080
I don't even know if you can tell.

2989
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:14,080
But there's a lot of material.

2990
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:15,420
That weird cat's back.

2991
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:15,900
Ma!

2992
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,980
I could work on this for like three more days.

2993
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:21,180
I'll probably still not be happy with it.

2994
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:23,220
But at some point you have to call it.

2995
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:24,220
And it has to be done.

2996
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:25,780
Because we have to move on.

2997
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:26,540
Yeah!

2998
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:27,980
Oh my god.

2999
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:30,260
The wires coming out of the eyes.

3000
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:31,500
Okay.

3001
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:31,900
We're gonna...

3002
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:33,160
I'm gonna zoom past guys.

3003
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:36,660
I know you guys really wanna watch the DIY part.

3004
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:38,560
But guys I wanna see the finished piece.

3005
02:26:41,460 --> 02:26:43,940
If you wanna watch the full video check it out.

3006
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:44,760
If you wanna watch the full video check it out.

3007
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,220
I'm being a fake React dandy.

3008
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:48,040
I'm being a fake React dandy.

3009
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:50,420
I'm gonna do it.

3010
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:50,660
I'm gonna do it.

3011
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:51,380
I'm gonna do it.

3012
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:57,800
Holy shit.

3013
02:26:57,900 --> 02:27:00,460
I love how like they did the sans effect.

3014
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:03,680
Where like if you carve the eye deep enough.

3015
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:06,540
You can make it so that eye will like follow you around.

3016
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:07,860
You can make it so that eye will like follow you around.

3017
02:27:07,860 --> 02:27:08,500
Doki please.

3018
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:10,560
We can bring catnip to moon.

3019
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:12,800
And this is what hangs off of his zipper pole.

3020
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,660
We could just paint it gold like it is in the game.

3021
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:19,200
But I've always wanted a reason to gold leaf something.

3022
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:21,220
But I've always wanted a reason to gold leaf something.

3023
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:22,180
I know we're extravagant and ridiculous.

3024
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:24,060
But only the best for our boy.

3025
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:26,080
I don't even know what gold leafing is.

3026
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:28,440
Well it's like super thin pieces of gold.

3027
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:29,660
No you're supposed to eat that.

3028
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:34,140
Oh my god she's wasting precious gold leaf food.

3029
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:35,820
How would the rich eat?

3030
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:38,320
They can't eat food without the gold leaf.

3031
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:38,700
And now it's gold.

3032
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:43,380
It's true.

3033
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:48,060
It's true.

3034
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:50,360
In order for rich people to eat.

3035
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:52,240
Gold leaf on top.

3036
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:55,840
Rich will starve.

3037
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:01,360
Oh my god they use like the pool noodles.

3038
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:02,220
That's so smart.

3039
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:03,200
The pool noodles.

3040
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:07,580
Ugh the rib cage.

3041
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:22,980
They're buying it all into this insanely awesome build.

3042
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:27,160
But at the same time this project has been the hardest thing we've ever done.

3043
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:28,300
The longest hours.

3044
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:29,260
The most setbacks.

3045
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:31,220
For only $3000 a day.

3046
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,640
You can starve a rich man.

3047
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:36,320
You can save a starving rich man.

3048
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:37,460
That's how you get better.

3049
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:41,640
To animate Catnap's head I'm using a huge servo.

3050
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:43,040
Because the head is really heavy.

3051
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:43,980
And we need a lot of torque.

3052
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:45,960
A servo is different than a wiper motor.

3053
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,860
Because I can tell it exactly how to move.

3054
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:51,140
To do that I'm using this free software called Batango.

3055
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:52,840
Which is used to animate animatronics.

3056
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:55,340
Instead of writing code I can just animate in a timeline.

3057
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:56,280
It's super fun.

3058
02:28:56,420 --> 02:28:58,820
Anytime I want I can just make a new animation for Catnap.

3059
02:28:58,980 --> 02:29:00,660
And when it's ready we export it to the Arduino.

3060
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:03,400
Y'all we just did a test run.

3061
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:05,060
I can't wait for you to see him in action.

3062
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:06,780
But before we do we just want to say thanks for watching.

3063
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:07,980
Oh my god I don't like that.

3064
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:10,640
This is... makes me uncomfortable.

3065
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:13,180
Just sitting next to it as if like he's friend.

3066
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:14,520
Like...

3067
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:17,700
That's so creepy.

3068
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:17,880
Creepy.

3069
02:29:33,150 --> 02:29:33,870
Uhhh.

3070
02:29:35,970 --> 02:29:36,690
Uhhh.

3071
02:29:37,210 --> 02:29:37,470
Hahaha.

3072
02:29:38,250 --> 02:29:38,970
Hahaha.

3073
02:29:39,970 --> 02:29:43,410
I won one for my six year old nephew.

3074
02:29:43,910 --> 02:29:44,610
Hahaha.

3075
02:29:48,570 --> 02:29:49,370
Oh god.

3076
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:51,110
When it's like night time too.

3077
02:29:51,930 --> 02:29:53,390
It's so cool though.

3078
02:29:53,610 --> 02:29:55,730
They've done like... they've actually repurposed like...

3079
02:29:55,730 --> 02:29:58,270
They've actually done like repurposing...

3080
02:29:58,870 --> 02:29:59,470
Um...

3081
02:29:59,470 --> 02:30:02,350
Like Halloween decorations too.

3082
02:30:02,450 --> 02:30:03,410
Wait let me show you guys.

3083
02:30:04,090 --> 02:30:04,430
Oh.

3084
02:30:06,490 --> 02:30:08,290
Like the spider one.

3085
02:30:09,230 --> 02:30:09,830
Like...

3086
02:30:09,830 --> 02:30:11,270
They made that.

3087
02:30:11,470 --> 02:30:12,730
And I'm gonna skip to the end.

3088
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:14,810
We've made a 12 foot spider.

3089
02:30:15,450 --> 02:30:16,050
Like...

3090
02:30:17,490 --> 02:30:20,190
They've repurposed that and turned it into this.

3091
02:30:20,230 --> 02:30:21,070
Which is insane.

3092
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:22,570
It's actually crazy.

3093
02:30:22,930 --> 02:30:25,890
They repurposed like old Halloween decorations.

3094
02:30:25,890 --> 02:30:27,650
To make like actual...

3095
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:28,770
Cool shit.

3096
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:35,110
If I wanna watch...

3097
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:36,330
Then watch the channel!

3098
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:38,130
Wicked Maker!

3099
02:30:38,490 --> 02:30:38,830
Hahaha.

3100
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:42,010
I'm just showing you an example.

3101
02:30:42,650 --> 02:30:43,390
Hahaha.

3102
02:30:43,390 --> 02:30:45,370
I've seen this video already.

3103
02:30:47,310 --> 02:30:48,610
There's no reaction.

3104
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:49,810
Cause I've seen it.

3105
02:30:53,350 --> 02:30:55,770
Tokeke's skipping to the end.

3106
02:30:55,770 --> 02:30:57,290
Like look at that.

3107
02:30:57,390 --> 02:30:58,130
That's so cool.

3108
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,280
I'm showing my favorite...

3109
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:04,740
Your... It's...

3110
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:07,060
Guys it's not you show me your favorite.

3111
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:09,380
It's me showing you my favorite channels.

3112
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:10,020
Haha.

3113
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:13,260
You take that back.

3114
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:14,020
Hahaha.

3115
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:17,320
It's like I'm showing you my mixtape.

3116
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:20,160
But instead I'm showing you my favorite videos.

3117
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:21,660
There's actually one.

3118
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:23,120
Where they made like...

3119
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:24,380
Last of Us props too.

3120
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,240
Um... I'll show you the short.

3121
02:31:28,100 --> 02:31:29,720
Let's turn this spirit Halloween animatronic...

3122
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,460
Oh my gosh.

3123
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:31,520
Okay the last of us one...

3124
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:32,200
Was really creepy.

3125
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:35,520
Uh... I remember watching their last of us one.

3126
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:36,780
Uh...

3127
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:38,340
Liked videos.

3128
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:41,520
Let's turn this spirit Halloween animatronic...

3129
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:43,760
Into a clicker from the last of us.

3130
02:31:43,900 --> 02:31:45,460
A giant mushroom bloom...

3131
02:31:45,460 --> 02:31:46,920
Has burst out of the clicker's skull.

3132
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:49,360
So first we're gonna cut a big ol' hole in his face...

3133
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:50,720
Where we want the mushroom to bloom out.

3134
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:53,500
To make the mushrooms we'll cut a bunch of flowering looking shapes...

3135
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:54,260
Out of EVA foam.

3136
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:56,600
We use a heat gun to bend and shape the pieces...

3137
02:31:57,420 --> 02:31:59,360
And top them with foam clay to bulk them out...

3138
02:31:59,360 --> 02:32:00,080
And give them some texture.

3139
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:03,040
If you look at the clickers in the show...

3140
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,800
They're really colorful to contrast with the bleak environment.

3141
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:06,960
To match that look...

3142
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:09,060
We airbrushed on some really bright colors...

3143
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:11,360
And then gave it a brown wash to make it look more organic.

3144
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:12,700
While I was painting...

3145
02:32:12,700 --> 02:32:14,600
Jay tweaked the animatronic to give it a more scary...

3146
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:17,000
It's really cool cause one is the crafter and the other one is the...

3147
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:19,000
Engineer with the electronics.

3148
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:21,900
Which is really cool that they're working together for this.

3149
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:23,360
...will fill any gaps with foam clay...

3150
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:24,360
And then add lots of details...

3151
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:25,840
I show you my mixtape...

3152
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:28,440
But skip until the end of the song.

3153
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:32,840
I just skip to where the drop is.

3154
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:36,140
Like holy shit...

3155
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:36,760
That's so cool.

3156
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:39,560
That's so cool.

3157
02:32:39,940 --> 02:32:41,280
I just skip to the drop.

3158
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,040
Yeah they made like...

3159
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:49,540
They've done like a lot of stuff.

3160
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:50,520
Which is really cool.

3161
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:51,800
That's why I love their channel as well.

3162
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:54,380
Cause they do like a lot of like...

3163
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:56,080
They repurpose like Halloween stuff.

3164
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:58,780
Into like actual cool Halloween decorations.

3165
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,340
I mean there's like a...

3166
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:02,280
Stuff... okay...

3167
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,440
Cause like...

3168
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:04,680
I don't wanna go outside.

3169
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:06,640
So instead of going outside...

3170
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:09,480
And like I don't like roller coasters and like animatronics.

3171
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:12,240
But I love watching like...

3172
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:14,460
People filming attractions.

3173
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:15,880
So like...

3174
02:33:15,880 --> 02:33:17,240
I don't know if you guys know like...

3175
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:18,140
Attractions 360.

3176
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:21,040
So like... instead of like actually...

3177
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:22,160
Riding the attractions.

3178
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:25,180
I just watch videos of people...

3179
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:28,920
I just watch videos...

3180
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,920
Of like other people...

3181
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:32,620
Like showing what's in the ride.

3182
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:34,660
So I don't have to go on the ride.

3183
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:39,820
I live...

3184
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:41,460
That's not sad!

3185
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:43,080
I just don't like...

3186
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:44,760
I don't like animatronics!

3187
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:46,120
IRL!

3188
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:49,040
Okay like I said I don't like animatronics.

3189
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:49,500
IRL.

3190
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:50,740
I don't like animatronics.

3191
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,480
But I love watching people make animatronics.

3192
02:33:53,700 --> 02:33:55,380
Because I find it really interesting.

3193
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:56,900
But I don't like them IRL.

3194
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:59,040
Like I think it's like... I'm always like really scared.

3195
02:33:59,100 --> 02:34:00,460
I was like... Ooh what if it touches me?

3196
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:03,660
Like it just scares the shit out of me.

3197
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:04,900
So I like watching...

3198
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,920
Experiencing it through video.

3199
02:34:07,380 --> 02:34:09,100
Because I'm not actually there.

3200
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:10,120
Like...

3201
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:12,920
Usually when I do ride... cause I'll give you an example.

3202
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:14,440
I rode that Harry Potter one.

3203
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:16,640
Um...

3204
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:17,820
From like... what is it?

3205
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:18,720
The...

3206
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:19,620
Oh my god.

3207
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:22,120
The fucking Dementors ride or whatever.

3208
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:24,400
And then like I closed my eyes.

3209
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:26,060
The entire time during Universal.

3210
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,260
Like you know the Universal rides?

3211
02:34:28,580 --> 02:34:29,800
I closed my eyes.

3212
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:31,920
And then I just... I just...

3213
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:33,480
I just don't experience it.

3214
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:35,280
And then like the Dementors ride.

3215
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:38,200
And then I remember like one of my friends was like...

3216
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:38,980
Open your eyes!

3217
02:34:39,380 --> 02:34:40,920
Oh my god this is the cool part!

3218
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:41,860
Open your eyes!

3219
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:42,800
And I was like... No.

3220
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:46,280
And then I just rode the entire ride just closing my eyes.

3221
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:48,000
Like I didn't even open my eyes.

3222
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:49,320
So then I was like...

3223
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:51,580
Oh shit what was in there?

3224
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:53,120
You know?

3225
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:58,100
It's not like I was super young or anything.

3226
02:34:58,400 --> 02:34:59,580
I think like I was like...

3227
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:02,460
Like first year of university or something.

3228
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:04,280
It was like first year of university.

3229
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:05,460
And...

3230
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:07,140
And it's like...

3231
02:35:07,140 --> 02:35:08,440
And then they're like open your eyes!

3232
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:09,360
You gotta see this!

3233
02:35:09,360 --> 02:35:10,680
Do I see this part?

3234
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:13,220
And then I just closed my eyes throughout the ride.

3235
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:16,260
So I never actually like saw what anything had.

3236
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:17,320
I felt it.

3237
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:18,720
I felt like...

3238
02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:24,200
I felt the ride.

3239
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:25,880
I felt the wind.

3240
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:26,640
And then...

3241
02:35:28,140 --> 02:35:29,720
I didn't... I don't know.

3242
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:32,080
I don't know...

3243
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:34,000
What it was... visually what it was.

3244
02:35:34,220 --> 02:35:36,080
So I just like looked up on YouTube.

3245
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:37,520
What the ride was like.

3246
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:38,460
And I was like... Oh hey!

3247
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:41,880
Thank god I didn't open my eyes cause that shit looks fucking scary.

3248
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:44,760
Thank fucking god.

3249
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:46,120
Thank fucking god.

3250
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,920
But I love like watching videos of like...

3251
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,600
Oh did you guys see the new...

3252
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:52,660
Okay guys.

3253
02:35:52,740 --> 02:35:53,500
Spoiler alert.

3254
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:56,420
The new like Universal Jurassic Park ride.

3255
02:35:56,740 --> 02:35:57,820
Looks so cool.

3256
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:59,300
I would never ride on it.

3257
02:35:59,660 --> 02:36:00,000
But...

3258
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:08,400
This one is like in Beijing right?

3259
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:09,700
The Universal Studios.

3260
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:11,380
I would never ride on it.

3261
02:36:11,420 --> 02:36:12,160
But it looks so cool.

3262
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:14,760
The Jurassic Road.

3263
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:15,240
I love it.

3264
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:20,210
Yeah it's in Beijing.

3265
02:36:21,150 --> 02:36:23,610
It's so cool cause it's apparently...

3266
02:36:23,610 --> 02:36:24,650
Uh...

3267
02:36:25,970 --> 02:36:27,410
It's apparently like...

3268
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:29,650
The dinosaur chases you too.

3269
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:32,810
I love looking at the...

3270
02:36:32,810 --> 02:36:33,590
Also like...

3271
02:36:33,590 --> 02:36:34,810
I like looking at the queue.

3272
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:35,810
The...

3273
02:36:35,810 --> 02:36:36,930
What is it called?

3274
02:36:37,230 --> 02:36:40,730
You know when you're in queue and they have like all these decorations in queue?

3275
02:36:41,470 --> 02:36:43,090
There's like a special name for it.

3276
02:36:43,910 --> 02:36:44,430
Um...

3277
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:46,090
What is it called?

3278
02:36:46,710 --> 02:36:47,550
Sometimes I always...

3279
02:36:47,550 --> 02:36:48,850
I do like the lightning ride...

3280
02:36:48,850 --> 02:36:49,670
The lightning ticket.

3281
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:52,450
So you can skip...

3282
02:36:52,450 --> 02:36:53,870
You can skip the line.

3283
02:36:54,110 --> 02:36:57,170
So if you skip the line you don't get to watch all the...

3284
02:36:57,170 --> 02:36:58,010
The...

3285
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:02,790
The decorations from the queue system.

3286
02:37:03,230 --> 02:37:05,150
So that's what I like to look at too.

3287
02:37:05,390 --> 02:37:06,050
Cause I get...

3288
02:37:06,050 --> 02:37:07,990
And also you get to like absorb it.

3289
02:37:08,090 --> 02:37:10,190
Instead of like being rushed in the queue.

3290
02:37:12,970 --> 02:37:14,010
It's so cool.

3291
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:14,750
The pre-show!

3292
02:37:14,890 --> 02:37:15,850
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

3293
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:19,250
If you have the lightning ticket you tend to skip all the pre-show.

3294
02:37:19,450 --> 02:37:20,630
And then you also have to like...

3295
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:22,630
You know you have to walk really fast during the pre-show.

3296
02:37:22,750 --> 02:37:23,530
Because you know...

3297
02:37:23,530 --> 02:37:24,950
You wanna get on the line.

3298
02:37:26,930 --> 02:37:28,170
Oh my god it's like we're there.

3299
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:30,930
Guys it's like we're riding on the attraction right now.

3300
02:37:31,550 --> 02:37:32,350
Oh my god.

3301
02:37:32,490 --> 02:37:34,210
Yeah you get to absorb the lore via video.

3302
02:37:34,710 --> 02:37:35,690
It's like we're there!

3303
02:37:36,170 --> 02:37:37,510
Holy shit it's so immersive!

3304
02:37:40,810 --> 02:37:42,870
Guys it's like we're just like we're there!

3305
02:37:43,090 --> 02:37:44,470
Hands in the air guys!

3306
02:37:44,470 --> 02:37:46,430
Arms in the air!

3307
02:37:54,270 --> 02:37:56,030
We're here right now!

3308
02:37:56,410 --> 02:37:57,410
We're in Beijing!

3309
02:38:02,290 --> 02:38:03,550
This is sad!

3310
02:38:03,730 --> 02:38:04,710
What do you mean?

3311
02:38:04,710 --> 02:38:05,950
We're in Beijing!

3312
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:09,470
We're in Beijing right now!

3313
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:10,390
We're in Beijing right now!

3314
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:18,910
It's so cool.

3315
02:38:18,970 --> 02:38:21,310
When it starts chasing you it's actually so freaky.

3316
02:38:21,470 --> 02:38:21,930
Ugh!

3317
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:26,430
So I think it starts...

3318
02:38:27,250 --> 02:38:29,250
That...I would never ride this IRL.

3319
02:38:29,650 --> 02:38:30,250
That...I would never ride this IRL.

3320
02:38:30,250 --> 02:38:31,190
I would never...

3321
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:32,950
I would never ride this.

3322
02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:48,410
It looks really cool though.

3323
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:50,710
Like it looks so immersive Like it looks so immersive.

3324
02:38:52,130 --> 02:38:53,090
This really seems pretty cool.

3325
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:54,850
Yes, but like what if it touches me?

3326
02:38:56,210 --> 02:38:58,930
That's like my irrational fear.

3327
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:01,110
I'm like what if it just touches me?

3328
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:16,980
These dogs look so cool.

3329
02:39:26,340 --> 02:39:28,040
Like look it starts moving.

3330
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:31,540
Holy shit, that's so fucking scary.

3331
02:39:31,540 --> 02:39:34,900
It just starts chasing you.

3332
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:38,160
Holy fuck.

3333
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:43,200
Oh even the car moves.

3334
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:50,220
Because like you think they don't chase you, you know like animatronics they don't move but then it moves.

3335
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:16,040
Okay, then this is just like, uh, I hate the... I'm not a huge fan of the the screens.

3336
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:18,860
I wish like it... I wish they use less screens.

3337
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:20,200
That's the my only issue.

3338
02:40:20,380 --> 02:40:23,880
I hate how like amusement park rides use a lot of screens now.

3339
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,780
Oh my god, there's the T-Rex!

3340
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:31,320
I hate the IMAX... IMAX segments.

3341
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:34,960
And like any animatronic and any like amusement park ride.

3342
02:40:36,860 --> 02:40:38,180
It just doesn't feel right.

3343
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:45,360
I thought they were going to kiss.

3344
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:46,760
Just like Godzilla.

3345
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:47,740
And King Kong.

3346
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:57,140
I love like the whole debate on why is she running with high heels.

3347
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:04,960
Oh my god, there's Ted.

3348
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:16,760
I wanna go to Universal Studios in Beijing.

3349
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:17,900
It looks so cool.

3350
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:23,880
You guys see the new like, uh, Zootopia Land in the Univer...

3351
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:25,020
Not Univer... Disney.

3352
02:41:27,400 --> 02:41:30,180
Soon Disney will buy Universal.

3353
02:41:33,730 --> 02:41:35,740
He's just sleeping chat.

3354
02:41:39,470 --> 02:41:40,860
So cool though.

3355
02:41:43,710 --> 02:41:44,260
Let's see.

3356
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:48,560
Yeah, there's a new Zootopia Land in Disneyland in Shanghai.

3357
02:41:50,060 --> 02:41:50,490
Uh...

3358
02:41:52,030 --> 02:41:53,880
I swear like the animatronics...

3359
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:55,420
There looks like so much...

3360
02:41:55,420 --> 02:42:04,440
To be fair, I think it's also because like Universal and the Universal Land in Disneyland in like Shanghai and Beijing are more like are newer builds.

3361
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:07,620
So they use like newer animatronics and stuff.

3362
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:11,500
And it's like obviously since it's newer build the technology is more high tech.

3363
02:42:11,860 --> 02:42:16,700
And the Disneyland and Universal's in Americas are like fucking old as hell.

3364
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:20,440
So it's like super dated.

3365
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:22,520
So it's like super dated.

3366
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:23,860
So it's like super dated.

3367
02:42:23,860 --> 02:42:29,300
So like all the newer amusement parks have all the cutting edge technology.

3368
02:42:30,160 --> 02:42:30,800
Like...

3369
02:42:32,380 --> 02:42:33,520
Even like the...

3370
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:34,440
Apparently...

3371
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:35,520
So like...

3372
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:35,760
Uh...

3373
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:37,820
Oh, Doggy Monk purchased Jay!

3374
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:39,920
Thank you for the 5,000 biddies!

3375
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:40,920
Thank you, thank you!

3376
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:42,000
Even like...

3377
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:42,320
Okay.

3378
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:42,940
So...

3379
02:42:42,940 --> 02:42:43,280
You...

3380
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:43,940
Is it like...

3381
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:44,860
Uh...

3382
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:47,540
America Disneyland has the Frozen ride, right?

3383
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:49,840
So America Disneyland has the Frozen ride.

3384
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:50,920
And then...

3385
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:51,320
Uh...

3386
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:53,460
Hong Kong Disneyland has like...

3387
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:55,040
The same Frozen ride.

3388
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:58,060
But the animatronics are better than...

3389
02:42:58,060 --> 02:42:58,920
Uh...

3390
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:00,740
Than like America's Disneyland.

3391
02:43:00,940 --> 02:43:04,320
Because it's using the newer animatronics where it's not using the...

3392
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:04,940
The...

3393
02:43:04,940 --> 02:43:05,500
The...

3394
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:05,840
What was it?

3395
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:06,720
The 2D faces?

3396
02:43:07,060 --> 02:43:10,040
Where like they use like the projected faces in America.

3397
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:11,920
Because that was the old animatronics.

3398
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:14,760
The newer animatronics actually uses like...

3399
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:15,400
Uh...

3400
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:18,000
Molded faces for like the Frozen...

3401
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,120
Let me see if I can find it.

3402
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:20,280
It's actually crazy.

3403
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:21,500
Hong Kong...

3404
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:22,620
Disneyland...

3405
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:22,960
And...

3406
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:23,820
Uh...

3407
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:26,800
Frozen versus America.

3408
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:30,160
Did anyone...

3409
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:31,120
Oh there's...

3410
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:33,420
I want to know of anyone made like a comparison video.

3411
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:34,120
Oh here you go.

3412
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:34,980
Here you go.

3413
02:43:35,420 --> 02:43:36,320
This was like...

3414
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:38,220
Here you go.

3415
02:43:38,280 --> 02:43:39,260
You can tell the difference.

3416
02:43:39,380 --> 02:43:40,200
It's actually crazy.

3417
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:44,120
Well Disney did it.

3418
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:46,240
They gave the Elsa animatronic a new face.

3419
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:49,620
This is actually new footage Disney released for Frozen Ever After.

3420
02:43:49,660 --> 02:43:51,720
This is Hong Kong Disneyland animatronic.

3421
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:52,580
This is Hong Kong Disneyland animatronic.

3422
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:54,400
Like, look!

3423
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:00,820
This is America!

3424
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:03,020
This is Hong Kong!

3425
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:08,120
She came out of Star Trek!

3426
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:10,680
This is the out of try's what I mean!

3427
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:11,440
This is the out of try's what I mean!

3428
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:11,700
This is the out of try's what I mean!

3429
02:44:11,700 --> 02:44:14,260
Cause like, Hong Kong just released a new Frozen Land!

3430
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:14,540
Cause like, Hong Kong just released a new Frozen Land!

3431
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:16,600
The comparison between the two!

3432
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:18,180
No fair!

3433
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:30,120
It's cause Amer- I swear, I think like, America Dizzy Land and Disney World is like the beta test and then after like beta test is over they're like, alright let's export this.

3434
02:44:35,440 --> 02:44:37,000
It's so bad!

3435
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:45,680
Both figures are programmed with the exact same movements and if you look closely, the new animatronics face matches the exact animation of the projected facial expressions.

3436
02:44:45,980 --> 02:44:47,540
And it works even better in my opinion.

3437
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:48,480
Yeah, it does!

3438
02:44:53,180 --> 02:44:54,640
Someone help her!

3439
02:44:55,560 --> 02:44:56,760
Oh my god!

3440
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:57,980
Um...

3441
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:07,120
But yeah, I feel like Disney- the Dizzy Lands and the Universal Studios outside of America are a lot better!

3442
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:11,580
Cause the technology is better, I feel like.

3443
02:45:11,620 --> 02:45:12,220
Cause it's newer!

3444
02:45:12,500 --> 02:45:14,940
The technology is like, newer too.

3445
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:17,880
Oh, and then like when- Okay, it's so freaky!

3446
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:18,460
Okay, wait wait.

3447
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:24,480
When like- Cause they're using projected faces, and because of their using projected faces, it breaks down!

3448
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:25,200
Okay, wait.

3449
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:28,280
Elsa animatronic malfunction.

3450
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:31,420
And it's just a black screen!

3451
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:33,700
And it's so weird!

3452
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:35,140
It's so scary!

3453
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:38,500
It's actually really scary!

3454
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:40,260
Let me see if I can find it.

3455
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,260
Okay, let's see.

3456
02:45:44,460 --> 02:45:45,760
Let's see if I can find it.

3457
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:46,980
It's actually so scary.

3458
02:45:51,410 --> 02:45:52,110
Wait, wait.

3459
02:45:53,690 --> 02:45:54,430
Wait, wait.

3460
02:45:54,510 --> 02:45:55,890
Look at this!

3461
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:10,050
Cause the projected face breaks down!

3462
02:46:10,270 --> 02:46:15,430
And sometimes like the face- Oh, and then the Mickey Mouse ride uses these too!

3463
02:46:15,590 --> 02:46:18,670
Mickey Mouse animatronic malfunction.

3464
02:46:19,490 --> 02:46:20,530
Okay, malfunction.

3465
02:46:20,790 --> 02:46:21,310
Okay.

3466
02:46:21,370 --> 02:46:22,390
I think it's this one, right?

3467
02:46:25,150 --> 02:46:25,670
Uhhhhhhh...

3468
02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:28,750
I used to- I watched some of the animatronic malfunction videos.

3469
02:46:29,650 --> 02:46:31,010
I love TPM.

3470
02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:33,770
Uhhhhhhh... Okay, let's see if I can find it.

3471
02:46:34,670 --> 02:46:35,550
Let's see.

3472
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:37,350
I think it- This is this one?

3473
02:46:37,930 --> 02:46:39,630
Bear frozen...

3474
02:46:40,690 --> 02:46:41,250
Uhhhhhhh...

3475
02:46:41,250 --> 02:46:42,730
Nope, not this one.

3476
02:46:42,890 --> 02:46:43,410
Where is it?

3477
02:46:43,990 --> 02:46:45,850
No, that's the- Oh my God!

3478
02:46:45,990 --> 02:46:48,750
Where is the one with the Mickey Mouse breaking down?

3479
02:46:49,190 --> 02:46:53,170
I love- I love watching animatronic malfunctions from TPM.

3480
02:46:53,650 --> 02:46:56,290
Top 10 Disney animatronic malfunctions.

3481
02:46:56,350 --> 02:46:56,870
Is it this one?

3482
02:46:58,050 --> 02:46:59,190
Where is it?

3483
02:47:00,090 --> 02:47:01,770
6, 5, Nope.

3484
02:47:02,570 --> 02:47:03,670
Not this one.

3485
02:47:03,730 --> 02:47:04,450
Wait, is it this one?

3486
02:47:05,130 --> 02:47:05,590
Nope.

3487
02:47:07,150 --> 02:47:07,610
No!

3488
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:08,770
Where is it?

3489
02:47:08,790 --> 02:47:09,230
TPM!

3490
02:47:09,790 --> 02:47:11,470
Don't you betray me right now!

3491
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:14,990
Don't you dare!

3492
02:47:15,870 --> 02:47:16,510
I- Oh!

3493
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:18,070
It's this one!

3494
02:47:18,250 --> 02:47:19,750
Wait, I think it's this one!

3495
02:47:20,270 --> 02:47:20,730
Okay.

3496
02:47:20,930 --> 02:47:21,950
Let me find it.

3497
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:25,830
Let's see.

3498
02:47:27,930 --> 02:47:29,630
Let me see if I can find it, guys.

3499
02:47:31,170 --> 02:47:32,230
This is this one.

3500
02:47:32,370 --> 02:47:32,690
Okay.

3501
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:39,170
Pirates, Figment, Million Dollar Bunny, Carousel, Frozen, Ever After.

3502
02:47:39,350 --> 02:47:39,830
Oh!

3503
02:47:40,050 --> 02:47:40,970
It's this one!

3504
02:47:41,110 --> 02:47:41,830
Okay, here it is!

3505
02:47:41,910 --> 02:47:43,610
This is the Frozen one I was talking about.

3506
02:47:45,390 --> 02:47:46,110
There it is.

3507
02:47:46,970 --> 02:47:47,850
There it is.

3508
02:47:49,090 --> 02:47:49,570
Oh!

3509
02:47:50,670 --> 02:47:51,150
Oh!

3510
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:53,990
Oh!

3511
02:47:53,990 --> 02:47:54,010
Oh!

3512
02:47:54,010 --> 02:47:54,110
Oh!

3513
02:47:54,110 --> 02:47:59,270
The glitching projected face looks exactly like the vertical lines you'd see on a damaged LED TV.

3514
02:47:59,490 --> 02:48:01,890
Only a little more unsettling.

3515
02:48:02,050 --> 02:48:03,050
SILENT HELL!

3516
02:48:03,710 --> 02:48:05,710
And it's so white!

3517
02:48:06,570 --> 02:48:08,670
Oh my god, bro!

3518
02:48:08,990 --> 02:48:12,070
Imagine being a kid and you see that!

3519
02:48:12,470 --> 02:48:12,550
Imagine being a kid and you see that!

3520
02:48:13,210 --> 02:48:14,610
Imagine being a kid and you see that!

3521
02:48:14,610 --> 02:48:15,090
Oh!

3522
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:20,450
Oh my god!

3523
02:48:20,470 --> 02:48:20,610
Oh my god!

3524
02:48:20,610 --> 02:48:25,590
Imagine being a kid and She scared at least 10 kids!

3525
02:48:26,210 --> 02:48:28,390
That shit's so fucking freaky!

3526
02:48:28,570 --> 02:48:29,950
There's like a Disney version...

3527
02:48:29,950 --> 02:48:31,730
There's like a Mickey Mouse of that too.

3528
02:48:31,990 --> 02:48:32,910
Oh my god.

3529
02:48:33,370 --> 02:48:34,210
Alright, guys.

3530
02:48:34,410 --> 02:48:35,630
I'm done showing you guys.

3531
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:37,230
I hope you guys enjoyed.

3532
02:48:37,750 --> 02:48:38,210
Uh...

3533
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:41,930
I hope...

3534
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:51,290
I hope you guys enjoyed me showing you all some of my favorite channels and videos.

3535
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:52,930
It was like... uh...

3536
02:48:52,930 --> 02:48:55,090
It was definitely...

3537
02:48:56,390 --> 02:48:59,990
It was a lot of random videos, a lot of random channels.

3538
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:01,590
This is what goes on in my mind.

3539
02:49:01,770 --> 02:49:03,010
It's been three hours!

3540
02:49:03,150 --> 02:49:03,590
I know!

3541
02:49:03,750 --> 02:49:04,810
It's been really fun though.

3542
02:49:04,870 --> 02:49:05,370
I had a lot of fun.

3543
02:49:05,470 --> 02:49:06,890
It's not gonna be a super common thing.

3544
02:49:07,510 --> 02:49:07,910
Uh...

3545
02:49:07,910 --> 02:49:09,370
It's just a little like...

3546
02:49:09,370 --> 02:49:13,390
I guess like maybe once every couple of months I do something like this.

3547
02:49:13,730 --> 02:49:16,610
Uh... be a really bad react to Andy.

3548
02:49:16,970 --> 02:49:17,370
Uh...

3549
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:17,850
Sad!

3550
02:49:17,970 --> 02:49:19,430
They gave me five gifted subs!

3551
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:19,890
Thank you!

3552
02:49:20,310 --> 02:49:28,590
To be fair, it's because like a lot of these videos and channels I've seen... I've... I've... like this is literally like some of my favorite channels and videos.

3553
02:49:28,890 --> 02:49:31,390
So like I've seen all these videos already!

3554
02:49:33,550 --> 02:49:36,570
So it's like watching you dragoons react to it.

3555
02:49:36,610 --> 02:49:43,370
You know how like people who like suggest like favorite moments, like favorite TV shows and they watch your reaction to your favorite part in the show?

3556
02:49:43,570 --> 02:49:45,230
That was me throughout this stream.

3557
02:49:45,370 --> 02:49:46,350
I was like Oh my god!

3558
02:49:46,370 --> 02:49:46,770
This part!

3559
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:49,310
I'm gonna look at chat now see how they react to it.

3560
02:49:49,450 --> 02:49:49,890
Like...

3561
02:49:54,470 --> 02:50:00,690
But it was really fun to see your reactions to some of my favorite videos and channels.

3562
02:50:01,870 --> 02:50:02,390

3563

Yeah, chat reacts to.

3567
02:50:06,390 --> 02:50:08,350
It's not streamer reacts to.

3568
02:50:08,410 --> 02:50:09,650
It's chat reacts to.

3569
02:50:10,410 --> 02:50:13,370

3570
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:16,870

3582
02:50:46,930 --> 02:50:51,630
Accidentally exposed myself as not subscribing to some of my favorite channels.

But you'll do better!

3584
