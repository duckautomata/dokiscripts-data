1
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:22,780
Oh Well, we have to sing the better one Okay

2
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,700
What did you say about my brother

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,540
What was the thing that changes your pov F5.

4
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,240
F5?

5
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,480
I've always wanted a brother.

6
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,180
It's my brother.

7
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,860
Just like you.

8
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,080
So guys, today we're here to explore.

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,720
Look at this.

10
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,480
We're going to explore World's Adventure.

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,640
We know where we want to go.

12
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,440
Literally, we were originally going to do the Disney The Disney was a Disney World one.

13
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,960
And then, when I was looking at Minecraft DLC, I saw this.

14
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,400
Yeah, so we switched.

15
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,060
I was like, oh my god.

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
Wait, but what do you mean adventure mode?

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,740
Wait, there's quests?

18
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,220
Yeah, there's quests to unlock like, more worlds.

19
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,940
So I guess we go to sandbox and we can go straight to Simba.

20
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,640
But we do like, adventure with explore all the worlds.

21
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,800
I was gonna say, I don't wanna I mean, we can try one, maybe.

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,900
We'll do one adventure and then if it's bad, we'll just go straight to the one we really wanna go to.

23
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,260
We can do that.

25
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,400
Yeah, so...

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I always have to go to...

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,600
Guys, if you're wondering why I have to tap the dressing room, for some reason for me, if I tap out, it kicks me out of the lobby.

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,240
So, this is my solution to that.

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,800
Alright, sound guy.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,520
Let me know if everything is okay for us.

31
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,360
For me and Mint.

32
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,580
Alright, so...

33
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,480
Hello, hello, hello!

34
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,480
Hello, everybody!

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,280
But yes, if we finish this, we'll go to Disney World.

36
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,820
It's like our reward.

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,840
Oh, did you buy that one?

38
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,580
No, I didn't.

39
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,320
We didn't?

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,140
Well, I feel like we should both buy it just for the skin pack.

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,360
Unless you wanna be a furry to Disney World.

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,980
Alright, here we go.

43
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm pressing the button.

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,040
I'm pressing it.

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,420
Woah!

46
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
Where are we?

47
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,260
Wait, we're in Alice in Wonderland!

48
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,060
Is this Alice?

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,760
No.

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,600
Wait, no.

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,300
Where are we?

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,500
I don't know.

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,860
I'm gonna jump.

54
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm gonna jump.

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,100
You're gonna jump?

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
She's swimming!

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,780
Daya!

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,020
Can you...

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,400
You can't contain me!

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Can you feel the love tonight?

61
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,700
What the hell did I just grab?

62
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,580
Oh, how odd.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,400
A visitor.

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,840
Seems you found this little refugee.

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
It's been a while since anyone else has shown up.

66
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,080
It's quite exciting.

67
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm sure you feel the same.

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,380
But anyway, you must be wondering about all this.

69
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,740
Lucky for you, you're speaking to me.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,860
Sonia, while I lack in awakeness, I make up for it with knowledge.

71
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:43,240
To fill you in, this is the dream pavilion and it can lead you to all sorts of magical places you may or may not have seen before.

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,740
I hear they sometimes appear in your most treasured dreams.

73
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,620
The dream pavilion is a place of connection and records.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,980
From here, you can always see what's happening.

75
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,660
You just need to know where to look.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,900
However, if there's anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask.

77
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh my god, where am I?

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,460
Movie Bar Inn.

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,680
What is that?

80
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,180
Wait, I didn't want to use this.

81
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,060
What's going on?

82
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,140
Wait, oh, there's a library here.

83
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,020
What's happening?

84
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,920
The record book of dreams.

85
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,240
It will automatically journal all sorts of information.

86
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,720
Just flip through.

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,460
Oh, in addition to the pavilion and the side rooms, this realm has some places to explore as well.

88
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,480
You can find some goodies around, I think.

89
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,820
Not that cute one.

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,020
There's gems.

91
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,100
Gem shards.

92
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,580
Collecting them will store them here.

93
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,280
They will grant certain powers.

94
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,640
Oh, okay.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,680
Wait, I have a compass.

96
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,500
This is the gem one.

97
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,480
It'll get you back here.

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,580
This is so elaborate.

99
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,080
This is so elaborate.

100
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,460
But it needs to be powered up first with a handy map.

101
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,220
And this is the crystal compass.

102
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,680
It's a peculiar device with many different powers.

103
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,360
But it runs on gem shards, so you'll need to collect some first before you can use any of them.

104
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,520
That should be it.

105
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,520
Do take care out there, but I'm sure you can handle it.

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,700
You forgot the yawn.

107
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,680
Okay, I got the quest.

108
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,540
I'm a gem one.

109
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
I already have a key.

110
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,040
I already have a key.

111
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm gonna unlock something.

112
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,020
The wand, like, transports us to places.

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,980
Yeah, it said, like, do you want to return to the hub?

114
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh my god, look at our map.

115
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
We have Snow White.

116
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,080
We got Alice in Wonderland.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,640
Aladdin.

118
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,740
Activate to detect... What the fuck?

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,680
I can cross wide gaps to get temporary speed boosts to push heavy boxes.

120
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,020
Oh, we are too stupid for this.

121
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,260
We are...

122
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,440
Whoa!

123
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:29,880
Oh!

124
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,900
Where did you take us?

125
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,060
Who are

126
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,140
you?

127
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,900
Oh my god, you're twin!

128
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,880
Who is that?

129
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,180
Is that some kind of ostrich?

130
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,720
Zazu keeps going on about Nala and I being betrothed.

131
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,040
I can't marry her.

132
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,440
She's my best friend.

133
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,760
Ask them if they're an ostrich.

134
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,200
Don't mind him, but hey, look like you're nice.

135
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,200
You wanna play with us?

136
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
Yeah, I know where we can go.

137
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,680
Come on.

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,040
Wait, it better not be the water hole again.

139
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,300
No, it's not.

140
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,060
Uncle Scar told me about it.

141
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,640
Like, he told you about the elephant graveyard and we almost got eaten by hyenas?

142
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,340
That is different.

143
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,900
No one said it's forbidden.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,620
Oh, he's a bad boy.

145
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,760
He's a bad boy.

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
Maybe we should ask Zazu.

147
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,380
Fine, let's go to Pride Rock.

148
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,860
You coming, new friend?

149
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,580
Alright.

150
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,260
Oh my god, look.

151
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,240
It's right over here.

152
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,960
Oh my god, look.

153
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,560
Oh my god, there's Pride Rock.

154
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,500
Look, it looks a lot smaller.

155
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,680
Circle of life.

156
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,520
Where's the rest of the animals?

157
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,860
They ate them all.

158
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,980
I feel like, is that the forbidden graveyard over there?

159
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,120
I think so.

160
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,180
We gotta get the gems too.

161
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,680
Fuck Simba.

162
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,980
Oh my god, it's your friends!

163
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,540
Look at them!

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,720
Oh wait, three gems nearby before they disappear.

165
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,940
Collect near before they disappear again?

166
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,860
Oh my god, is this time?

167
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,520
There's no way.

168
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,960
There's over there.

169
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,340
I see them.

170
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,660
Where?

171
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,620
It's a blue gem.

172
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,640
Can I hit you?

173
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,900
I thought I turned TVB on.

174
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,440
You turned TVB on!

175
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,500
I tried!

176
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,360
Oh my god, Disney won't let us commit violence.

177
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,180
Yeah, we tried to turn TVB on.

178
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,340
I tried to turn TVB on.

179
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,960
Oh my god, there's zebras!

180
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,840
There's zebras!

181
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,240
Eat it, eat it!

182
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,900
A circle of life.

183
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,320
There's only like four of each animal.

184
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,640
It's Noah's Ark.

185
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,560
There's a really dead number.

186
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,260
It's Noah's Ark!

187
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,960
That's what happened in the aftermath.

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,740
The lions are too hungry.

189
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,820
I'm so hungry.

190
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,040
Wait, what's this?

191
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,180
Oh my gosh, it's an elephant!

192
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,300
Wait, is there also only four elephants?

193
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,920
They're so tiny.

194
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,540
They're really small.

195
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,760
Wait, there's Scar!

196
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,080
Oh my god, you're my hero!

197
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,920
Oh my god!

198
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,160
There he is!

199
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,180
What is he saying?

200
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,180
Read it.

201
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,180
I'm reading.

202
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,180
I wonder when my brother will next descend from on high to mingle with the commoners.

203
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,440
Oh, that's it?

204
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,580
That's all he's got to say?

205
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,460
I'll tear you!

206
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,760
My dad said I'll be king next!

207
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,200
Everybody look left!

208
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,260
Everybody look right!

209
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,960
Everybody look up!

210
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,720
Send in the spotlight!

211
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,420
Not yet!

212
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,360
Yeah, I am a nepo baby.

213
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,040
Oh my god, this elephant's climbing the tree.

214
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,180
I should turn down my music.

215
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,820
How's the audio, everybody?

216
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,480
Actual, like, original music, too, for this game.

217
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,460
I know!

218
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,340
That's crazy.

219
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
It's looking Minecraft.

220
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,440
It's like Minecraft version of...

221
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,920
What the hell is this?

222
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,420
Oh, it's a wildebeest!

223
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,500
That's gonna kill my dad!

224
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,100
Oh my god!

225
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

226
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,500
That's the dad killer!

227
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,880
That thing killed my dad!

228
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,840
This is where I'm almost dying.

229
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,740
It looks like it needs to eat.

230
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,440
It's so skinny.

231
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,940
It's so starving.

232
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
How hungry are you?

233
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,620
Oh my gosh, wait!

234
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,940
Timon and Pumbaa gotta meet up.

235
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,900
Timon and Pumbaa's here.

236
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
Well, I gotta change my clothes real quick.

238
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,360
Alright, we're changing, everybody.

239
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,040
We're changing.

240
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,160
We're changing.

241
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,260
Alright, am I...?

242
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,080
Yes.

243
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,600
Wait, where are you?

244
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,440
I'm changing.

245
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,160
You're changing?

246
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,300
Oh, don't look, guys.

247
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,780
Don't look.

248
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,300
She's changing right now.

249
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,780
Where are you?

250
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,500
Where'd you go?

251
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm in front of you.

252
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,700
Do you not see me?

253
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, I'm loaded.

254
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
Wait, let me...

255
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,280
Wait, where are you?

256
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,720
Turn around, turn around!

257
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,480
Do you not see me?

258
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm invisible, too!

259
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,040
Where are you?

260
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,540
What a wonderful phrase.

261
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,320
Where are you?

262
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,160
Oh my god, the world of beasts is really freaking out behind me.

263
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm right beside you.

264
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,060
Where are you?

265
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,060
Wait, do you actually...

266
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,880
Wait, let me change.

267
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll change my skin.

268
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,100
I'll be Sans for a little bit.

269
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,900
So do you see me?

270
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,520
Do you see Sans?

271
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
Okay, do you see me now?

272
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,420
What a wonderful phrase.

273
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,600
Wait, wait, wait.

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,760
Look at me.

275
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,720
Look at me real quick.

276
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh, are you gonna dab or something?

277
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,340
I'm gonna...

278
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,100
Wait, what's...

279
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,280
Dance, Timon, dance!

280
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,500
Let's go.

281
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,420
We should've been doing quests, but we're just out here.

282
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
We're just out here exploring.

283
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,900
Wait, there's a pathway over here.

284
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,020
Oh, we might be able to find an actual Timon and Pumba.

285
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,020
Yeah.

286
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,580
And then we'll kill them and take their roles.

287
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,260
We're skinwalkers.

288
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,860
Yeah.

289
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,260
Oh, I see them!

290
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,220
Oh my god, he's so tiny.

291
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
He's so tiny.

292
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,920
He's freaking out!

293
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,080
He's like, what the fuck?

294
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,660
Do you remember the old Lion King CD-ROM games?

295
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,320
Have you ever played them?

296
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,320
No, I didn't.

297
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,200
I think that has to be...

298
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Hey, Timon, come here.

299
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,520
I found...

300
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,540
You know, you think it's a really juicy bug grub?

301
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,160
Pumba, are you nuts?

302
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,720
That's obviously a big two-legged aardvark.

303
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,120
Oh, they're talking about us!

304
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,040
An aardvark?

305
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,480
Yeah, everyone knows aardvarks only eat bugs so they're not dangerous.

306
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,660
Come on.

307
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,720
You voice Pumba, I'll voice Timon.

308
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,020
Okay.

309
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,400
Come on, let's approach, slowly.

310
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,040
Okay, I'll be quiet.

311
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,160
I'm not burping.

312
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,500
Sorry.

313
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,680
You have to!

314
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,980
You have to!

315
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
You have to!

316
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,800
Sorry.

317
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,800
Sorry.

318
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,920
And they've spotted us.

319
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,260
Oh my god, he's got attitude.

320
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,220
Wow, they look really brave and strong.

321
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,740
Oh, Timon, you don't think?

322
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,360
I guess he does.

323
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,120
What does that mean?

324
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,480
Shh!

325
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,800
If this is really the protector we were hoping for, we can't be too obvious.

326
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,620
First, we make friends.

327
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,460
With games?

328
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,600
Exactly.

329
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,480
Ahem.

330
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,000
Say, brave warrior.

331
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,500
Might you be up for some friendly competition?

332
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,180
Yeah!

333
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,160
Wanna catch some grub?

334
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,160
Are we in?

335
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,640
Should we do it?

336
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,220
I'm gonna look at the instructions first.

337
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,940
I looked at the instructions.

338
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,600
Whoa!

339
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,060
Wait, did you go in?

340
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:30,980
Yeah.

341
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,780
All persons search the part of the jungle to catch as many grub as they can.

342
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,260
But grubs can be tricky.

343
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,720
They may hide underneath logs, so you'll need to rustle.

344
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,360
And don't forget...

345
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,320
Oh my god, it's a competition.

346
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,180
Wait, are you fighting?

347
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,320
I see you!

348
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,720
That's not me!

349
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm not even...

350
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,100
Oh, okay.

351
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh my god, there's so...

352
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,320
There's so many taboos!

353
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,360
What is this?

354
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,640
Wait, how do I pick them up?

355
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,000
How do I pick them up?

356
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,100
Oh my god, he just ate them!

357
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,760
No, no, no, that's mine!

358
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,860
How do you pick them up?

359
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,640
I didn't read the instructions!

360
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
How do you pick them up?

361
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,540
Uh, uh, uh...

362
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,020
I don't know!

363
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,260
I don't know!

364
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,440
I

365
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,300
got it!

366
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
We got five points!

367
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:24,940
We did it!

368
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,420
I think we're the worst version of Timon and Pova.

369
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,800
How do we...

370
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,840
These are like five Timons, though.

371
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,620
Like, what the hell?

372
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,900
Okay, let's read the instructions.

373
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,340
Okay, okay, okay.

374
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,000
Instructions.

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,160
Here are the rules.

376
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,820
You just click on the...

377
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,940
The hitbox is so fun!

378
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,200
I tried clicking!

379
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,220
Me too!

380
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,780
They just run up and get them.

381
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah, this is not fair.

382
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,320
Why are there five Timons?

383
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,800
I don't know.

384
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,660
It's like they're multiplying.

385
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
Also, didn't they want our help?

386
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,100
Why are they beating us?

387
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
Okay, I'm trying my best.

388
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,240
Okay.

389
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,020
Grab it!

390
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,520
Grab it!

391
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,020
I don't understand!

392
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,600
I can't grab him!

393
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I can't grab him!

394
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm trying!

395
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,140
I can't grab him!

396
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,260
I'm trying to grab him!

397
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,540
Let me grab him!

398
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,360
How did we get five points before?

399
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,040
I don't know how we got five points there.

400
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,200
I don't know.

401
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,760
How did we grab him?

402
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,140
I grabbed him one time!

403
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,820
It's not letting me!

404
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,560
Oh, it's right click!

405
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,260
It's right click.

406
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,460
Oh my god, I was...

407
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,560
Oh my god.

408
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,000
I got it.

409
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,240
Oh my god, I got him.

410
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,840
Wait, there was a guy here.

411
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,840
I like the actual Minecraft.

412
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,380
Oh my god.

413
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,220
We can do this!

414
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,160
We can beat them!

415
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,420
We can beat them!

416
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,800
We're better!

417
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,380
The moment we beat them, we become Timon and Pumbaa.

418
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,800
Oh, okay.

419
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,140
We almost got it.

420
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,840
We figured it out.

421
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,480
That's right, we're Timon and Pumbaa now.

422
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,800
We're taking your skin now.

423
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,420
I did try right click earlier.

424
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
I don't know, probably the hitbox.

425
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,060
Yeah, probably the hitbox.

426
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,940
It's okay, we won.

427
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,060
We won!

428
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,760
Oh no.

429
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,860
You guys can go die now, so we'll be the new Timon and Pumbaa.

430
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,720
We're better.

431
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,040
We stand on two legs.

432
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,620
Wait, what did they want us to do?

433
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,580
They didn't say congratulations or anything.

434
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,180
Oh, no, they did.

435
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,960
They said it to me.

436
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,780
What the hell?

437
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,660
Also, my music died.

438
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,280
It was playing Minecraft music for a little bit.

439
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,440
And it just died on us.

440
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,220
Wait, I have other emotes?

441
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,440
Oh my god, what are emotes?

442
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,060
Oh my god, I want...

443
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,100
Wait, no, I have to pay for this, nevermind.

444
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,020
Wait, did you pay for your...

445
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,060
Did you pay for your dance emotes?

446
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,400
I don't think so.

447
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,640
Wait, how do you have...

448
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,760
I just have wave.

449
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,140
What's this?

450
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,660
I have figure skating.

451
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,480
I have...

452
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,120
I have...

453
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,840
I like the kick part.

454
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,440
Wait, hold on.

455
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,740
I want to see if you do it again.

456
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,760
Wait, no, not that.

457
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,020
Why do I have just regular Minecraft music playing?

458
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,260
Again!

459
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,080
Again!

460
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,940
Come on, go!

461
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,100
Shake that booty!

462
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,900
It looks like the Megan dance.

463
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,940
Oh my god, look at him go!

464
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,960
It's not fair, all I could do is clap.

465
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,080
This is not fair.

466
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,780
That sounds like a skill issue.

467
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,940
It's not fair.

468
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,520
I can't either pay for it or...

469
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,600
The clouds!

470
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,320
Wait, there's Transformers emotes?

471
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,420
Wait, what the fuck is the Transformer emote?

472
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,500
What do you mean by that?

473
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,280
It's like...

474
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,280
Okay, wait, I'm gonna buy this!

475
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,140
I'm gonna see!

476
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,180
I'll buy this and then I'll show you.

477
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,840
Oh my gosh, I'm back to normal.

478
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,100
Okay, okay, okay, wait, how do I...

479
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,500
How do I equip this?

480
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,440
Equip...

481
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,280
No, you gotta...

482
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,880
There's a whole Transformers DLC!

483
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,780
Okay, okay, okay, watch this.

484
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,360
Watch this, okay.

485
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,580
Okay, okay.

486
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,520
It's like, I need to see this too.

487
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,040
Okay, watch this.

488
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,060
It was worth it.

489
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,540
Woah!

490
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,100
Transformers!

491
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,920
More than meets the eye!

492
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,160
Wait, can you see the legs?

493
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,320
Yeah!

494
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,460
Where do you get the emotes?

495
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,800
Transformers.

496
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,300
You know when you press to change emotes?

497
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,940
And you scroll down?

498
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,100
There's a Transformers icon.

499
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,820
Wait, I don't even remember how I changed it.

500
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,380
There's a Tetris one!

501
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,180
Oh my god!

502
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,220
Oh my god!

503
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,280
There's a Tetris one!

504
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,760
There's Mega Man?!

505
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,240
Oh my god!

506
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
Oh, I see, I see!

507
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
You see the Transformer icon?

508
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Optimus kick.

509
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,420
Wait, you're...

510
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,740
Yeah, mine is the...

511
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,300
You can still see his tail!

512
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,420
What the hell is this?

513
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,400
Oh my god!

514
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,240
What the hell is this?

515
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,380
There's so many...

516
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,740
Wait, there's...

517
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,340
Wait, there's an angry bird?

518
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,620
Angry bird!

519
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,640
There's Halo!

520
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,640
Anger management, this is so lame.

521
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,940
Wait, there's Spongebob!

522
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,580
Oh my god, there's Halo too!

523
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,640
Yeah!

524
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,460
Oh, superhero!

525
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,700
Wait, there's...

526
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,680
Oh my god, wait!

527
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,520
Wait, I just have enough!

528
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,780
I just have enough for this!

529
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,140
Okay, okay, okay.

530
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,220
Watch this, watch this.

531
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,740
Are you looking?

532
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,400
Hold on, hold on, I'm looking at my own emote.

533
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,500
Okay, okay, okay.

534
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,000
Do it, do it, do it.

535
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
Okay, watch this.

536
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,040
Naruto!

537
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,580
Gotta go fast!

538
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,760
Gotta go faster, faster, faster!

539
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,320
Does it actually make you run faster?

540
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:19,700
Try.

541
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,280
No, I can't.

542
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,840
I can't move while emoting.

543
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,580
I can just be like...

544
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,800
So you just run in place?

545
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,080
Hold on, I'm gonna buy one too.

546
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,360
Wait, not that.

547
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,960
Guys, which one should I get?

548
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,600
There's so many.

549
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,920
There's so many.

550
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,200
There's so many.

551
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,680
Pumba the Hedgehog.

552
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,040
Oh my god.

553
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,480
Oh my god, oh my god.

554
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,440
I like how we're spending money in Minecraft.

555
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,520
I got these points for free, okay?

556
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,440
I'm sure you did.

557
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,000
Wait, they have Ben 10?

558
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,040
Wait, there's an actual anime run.

559
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,040
There's actual Naruto.

560
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,800
Oh my god.

561
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,740
They have Ben 10.

562
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,580
That's actually crazy.

563
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,760
There's so many.

564
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,000
Why the fuck do we play Java?

565
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,680
We could've had this.

566
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,180
Oh my god, there is anime.

567
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,040
Okay, but I prefer Sonic 1 more.

568
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,160
I don't understand.

569
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,400
What's the squirrel one?

570
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
The squirrel one?

571
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,280
Is that from Playing Dead?

572
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,800
What the fuck kind of show is this?

573
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,060
I don't know.

574
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,460
Wait, there's more pages?

575
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,820
No, the second page is just a little bit.

576
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,420
Oh, there's how to train your dragon here.

577
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,720
What does Ben 10 do?

578
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,640
Ben 10?

579
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,080
He does this like...

580
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,520
Oh, it's Ice Age!

581
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,340
The squirrel is Ice Age.

582
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,940
Posing like a hero.

583
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,880
What is this?

584
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,420
Dancing like...

585
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,560
Hakuna Matata.

586
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,300
Oh, there's Hakuna Matata.

587
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,320
There's just a T-pose.

588
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,960
Wait, why are there two different types of T-poses?

589
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,040
And one is more expensive than the other one.

590
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,820
Wait, what?

591
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,280
I think there's like common versions, and then there's rare versions, but this is literally the same thing.

592
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,140
Yeah, it's the same evil.

593
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,300
What's the difference?

594
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,380
I like the Tetris one.

595
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,660
There is a dab one.

596
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh, there's Tetris one.

597
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,140
Yeah, where he's in the air.

598
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,840
The drop one?

599
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,120
What's going on here?

600
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,620
Tetris dance?

601
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,500
That's so good, wait.

602
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,540
I sort of want to buy this, but you spend $5.

603
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,140
I sort of want to be Tetris.

604
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,780
It's just so good.

605
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,480
It's so good.

606
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,100
There's like some really random ones.

607
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,080
Oh, I see the dab.

608
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,960
I see the dab.

609
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
Oh my god, I can make Puma do a dab.

610
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,000
Wait, bouncy ball?

611
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,480
He turns into a ball, I saw that, yeah.

612
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,960
There's one where...

613
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,720
Maybe there's the ones that we want, but cheaper.

614
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,260
Like, try and find ones that you want, but as a common.

615
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,180
I don't think I can find a Tetris one that's cheaper.

616
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,960
I don't...

617
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,200
No, the Tetris one is kind of insane.

618
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,900
Why doesn't...

619
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,280
Oh, Java.

620
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
I know Java, you can have a mod where you can add emotes and stuff, but like...

621
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,320
This is just better.

622
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,060
I think maybe free emotes would be better.

623
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,700
But like...

624
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,200
Can I be a Transformer?

625
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,200
Transformers, roll out.

626
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,920
Autobots, roll out.

627
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,860
Oh my god, it's dark!

628
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,620
Wait, what emote did you buy?

629
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,440
I didn't buy one.

630
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,400
I thought you were gonna buy one with your free coins.

631
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
Okay, I'll buy one with my free coins.

632
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do it.

633
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,200
Oh, somebody, thank you Kaz for the super chat for Tetris, thank you, it's worth it.

634
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,900
Wow.

635
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,040
That's the only thing I want.

636
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,560
The Tetris one was the only one I want.

637
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,000
Okay, let me...

638
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,120
Yeah, let me buy this.

639
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,900
Don't worry, it's worth it.

640
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,840
I tabbed out to buy Tetris.

641
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,140
Okay, give me a sec.

642
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm buying my Tetris emote.

643
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,060
Thank you guys for enabling me.

644
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,340
I really appreciate it.

645
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,940
I don't know what I'm doing.

646
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,980
I'm purchasing in progress.

647
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,940
Thank you everybody.

648
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,880
Thank you.

649
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,020
Let's do it together, you ready?

650
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,280
Okay, yeah, yeah.

651
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,260
3, 2, 1, go.

652
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,560
One more time, one more time.

653
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,220
3, 2, 1, go.

654
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,820
Da da da...

655
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,480
Okay, we should progress the world.

656
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,340
Yeah, let's go do the world things now.

657
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,040
Wait, let's...

658
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,880
Are we doing the quest, or do we just want to explore...

659
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,880
area?

660
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,380
I think we could talk to them because they might have...

661
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,240
Oh, Simba and Nala?

662
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,180
We'll be like, sorry, we're too busy Tetrising.

663
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,580
We're definitely Timon and Pumbaa.

664
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,680
Yeah, we're your friends.

665
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,400
What a wonderful friends.

666
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,820
Do you think we can go to the little crevice that Simba died at?

667
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,260
Yeah, where Simba's dad died?

668
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,100
I think it's here.

669
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,200
I think it's literally here.

670
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,060
Oh my god!

671
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,520
Wait, we can recreate it!

672
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,660
Oh my god, we can recreate it!

673
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,260
Simba...

674
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,480
Wait, there's something over there.

675
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,040
Do you see it?

676
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
Oh my gosh, that's probably his soul.

677
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,800
Oh my god, is that dad?

678
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,720
You're not him anymore.

679
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,060
The gorge.

680
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,140
Oh, what's this?

681
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,880
You collected one collectible of this world.

682
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh, is that my dad?

683
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,120
My dad's dead body?

684
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,380
Your dad's dead body.

685
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,180
What's that?

686
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,020
What's that?

687
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,560
I can sense gem shards behind...

688
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,680
If only you could jump such a distance.

689
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,780
Oh, it's just to get gem shards.

690
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,420
Oh, so it's like my dad's soul I collected him.

691
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,560
He's just a collectible.

692
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,400
Wait, what if I jump here?

693
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,320
Oh, shit.

694
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh, this is where we have to be able to jump.

695
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,700
Magic wand.

696
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,660
Do you want... oh wait, no, I don't want to return to hub.

697
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,700
How do I... magic...

698
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,720
What the hell is that?

699
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,220
Where are you?

700
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,640
Wait, is that another collectible?

701
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,460
That's what I thought, but it's actually a person.

702
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,700
Wait, oh, it's the hyena!

703
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,380
Yeah, you gotta get up from here.

704
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,060
Alright, what does he say?

705
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,480
Oh, he was a collectible!

706
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,440
Oh my god, we collected the hyena!

707
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,980
He's ours now.

708
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,380
He's our pet now.

709
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,760
Oh, shit, I was so close.

710
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,460
I got it.

711
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,620
Oh, parkour!

712
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,740
Okay, now I don't know what to do.

713
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,200
Okay, now I can't do the jump here.

714
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,520
I thought we were talking to Simba and Nala.

715
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,800
We're going, we're going.

716
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,520
I'm looking at the map.

717
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,020
Oh, it's on the other side.

718
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,260
Can you feel the love tonight, Timon?

719
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,620
I can see what's happening.

720
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,460
Some... I don't know.

721
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,240
Oh, there they are.

722
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,880
Oh, there they are.

723
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,420
They fell in love with their lions.

724
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:00,820
Hello.

725
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,960
You can talk to him.

726
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,820
Alright, this is our home, Pride Rock.

727
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,420
And I'm gonna be the king someday.

728
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,160
Let's hurry up and find Zazu.

729
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,320
Where could he be?

730
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,840
Zazu.

731
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,820
Where's Zazu?

732
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,960
Oh, god, they're gone.

733
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,860
Oh, okay.

734
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,480
Goodbye.

735
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,640
Okay, we have to find Zazu.

736
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,800
Like, I'm looking at the map.

737
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,380
Zazu should be, like, right here.

738
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,980
Look, you see the exclamation point?

739
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,420
He's up here.

740
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,820
Wait, he's on Pride Rock?

741
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,620
Yeah.

742
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
Zazu, what are you doing up here?

743
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,860
That's for the monkey.

744
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,780
Oh, my gosh, there's lions in here.

745
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,080
Wait, wait, I wanna see.

746
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,840
Oh, it's Mufasa.

747
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,980
Look, I've never seen a creature like this around here.

748
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,320
Neither have I, Zazu, but they don't look like trouble.

749
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,780
Hello, I'm Mufasa.

750
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,860
Welcome to the- Wait, he's alive!

751
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,480
He hasn't died yet!

752
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,380
Are we gonna recreate their deaths?

753
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,060
Oh, my god.

754
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,200
We're gonna recreate their deaths.

755
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,840
Let's go!

756
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,820
I must ask, did my son bring you here?

757
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,300
He has a knack for surprises.

758
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,020
Speaking of your son, sire, I'd better have a look at what he and Nala are up to.

759
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,580
I don't have a good feeling about it.

760
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,960
You never do, Zazu.

761
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,060
We can find Simba outside Pride Rock.

762
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,480
Is that mom?

763
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,240
Oh, they don't wanna talk to us.

764
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,700
Oh, there's Rafiki's thing.

765
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,640
Alright, where is... It's like over there.

766
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,420
Oh, do we go to the elephant graveyard?

767
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,620
Oh, there they are!

768
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,180
I see them.

769
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,680
There you are, Zazu.

770
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,940
Can we go to the jungle, please?

771
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,500
The jungle?

772
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,600
Don't be ridiculous.

773
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,480
Do you have any idea how dangerous that would be?

774
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,280
It's outside the Pride Lands.

775
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,600
We're lions.

776
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,580
But Uncle Scar said there's nothing a lion would have to be afraid of there.

777
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,400
A grown lion, perhaps, but a cub?

778
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,980
I'm not so sure.

779
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,120
Come on, Zazu.

780
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,300
It'll be fun.

781
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,720
Besides, what could happen while you're with us?

782
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm really not.

783
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,920
Hey, don't you dare run off!

784
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,760
Come back!

785
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,260
Sire, you're here!

786
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,360
Simba... Nala...

787
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,720
Mufasa just shows up, pops out, like...

788
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,900
Nala, where do you think you're going?

789
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,720
I told you leaving the Pride Lands would be dangerous.

790
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,180
What is he gonna say?

791
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,140
And you try to drag Zazu along with you?

792
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

793
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,100
I just thought it'd be fun.

794
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,720
It's only the jungle.

795
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:55,920
Simba...

796
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,160
You're too...

797
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,240
You're too young, and someday you will be king.

798
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:09,400
That is a very big responsibility, requiring you to be responsible.

799
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,720
I know, Dad.

800
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,640
I'm really sorry.

801
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,880
Well, I'm glad I caught you before anyone was hurt.

802
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,140
Now we're going home.

803
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,760
Sorry, we can't show you the jungle.

804
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,020
I bet it's really cool.

805
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,500
We can't show them, but maybe they can tell us what it's like.

806
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,360
Why do you... Oh my god, they talk so much.

807
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,220
It's already... The sun's out already.

808
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,740
I know!

809
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,680
Think about it.

810
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,580
They're not forbidden from leaving the Pride Lands.

811
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,440
They can go there and tell us about it.

812
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,680
Oh yeah!

813
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,640
Then we'll see how fun it'll be when we get there.

814
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,980
Of course, that'd be a long time when we're grown.

815
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,560
Then it's a plan.

816
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,220
Will you go to the jungle on a scouting mission for us?

817
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,260
You will?

818
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,040
Awesome!

819
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,380
Yes, I can.

820
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,700
Okay, okay.

821
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,840
I think...

822
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,780
I did it.

823
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,920
We already went to the jungle.

824
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,940
Do we have to do it again?

825
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,400
Let me show you something.

826
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,120
Come over here.

827
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,460
Okay.

828
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,900
Come over here.

829
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,920
Follow me.

830
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:31,840
Follow me.

831
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,660
Simba.

832
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:33,940
Simba.

833
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,820
Simba.

834
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,380
Follow me.

835
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,440
We gotta get the other three gems.

836
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,780
Collect two gems before they disappear again.

837
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,640
The baobab tree.

838
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,160
Oh, is this where Rafiki lives?

839
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh my God, this is a tall-ass fucking tree.

840
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,920
Oh, there he is!

841
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,100
The weather is very particular, don't you think?

842
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,100
Oh, that's all you say?

843
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,320
That's all you say?

844
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,440
Wait, he said something else.

845
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,180
What'd he say?

846
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,700
Hardcore.

847
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,340
I tried to...

848
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,920
Something else popped up.

849
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,740
Did you guys see it?

850
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

851
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,800
Talk to him.

852
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,060
No, it didn't show up again after.

853
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,260
Maybe I clicked on you.

854
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:15,920
No?

855
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,200
I know who you are, but it's... Oh, he knows who we are.

856
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,120
What?

857
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,140
He knows who we are.

858
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,580
Oh, he's dancing!

859
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,540
Watch out, Rafiki!

860
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,280
Watch out!

861
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,060
Watch out!

862
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,360
You're gonna get Tetris!

863
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,700
I just wanna recreate Mufasa's death.

864
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,660
Maybe that's the end of the story.

865
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,740
Is he gonna die?

866
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,480
I thought he was gonna... I thought he was gonna grow up.

867
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,620
I mean, we have to go to the jungle.

868
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,260
Yeah, we gotta go to the jungle first.

869
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,960
Let's see if we can recreate his death first.

870
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,060
But usually they, like, disappear.

871
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,540
Let's go to the jungle and see if there's anything over there now.

872
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,580
Where did you go?

873
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,000
Towards the jungle.

874
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,520
Where are you?

875
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,720
Where are you?

876
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,360
Where are you?

877
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm going to the jungle.

878
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,120
I'm following the pathway.

879
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,580
I see Scar.

880
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,200
I went the other way.

881
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,480
I was in front of Pride Rock.

882
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,280
Oh, okay.

883
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,160
So, I'm going... I'm looking at my map.

884
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,740
I have a map.

885
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,220
You know, we all have that map now.

886
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,000
I wonder if we can change the timeline.

887
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,000
Save him?

888
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,920
We can save Mufasa?

889
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,420
Save Mufasa!

890
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,480
Or we just kill Scar right now.

891
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,940
Where are you?

892
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,440
I'm heading to the jungle!

893
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,980
I'm literally in the jungle!

894
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,400
So am I!

895
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,120
I'm already here.

896
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,560
Me too!

897
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,260
No, you're not.

898
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,820
Yes, I am!

899
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,640
Oh, yeah, I see your name.

900
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
Somebody is a snowpoke.

901
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm in the jungle.

902
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,020
Yeah, I'm next to them.

903
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,140
I don't think we need to talk to them again.

904
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,820
Yes, we do.

905
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,160
It's literally on the map.

906
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,300
Wait, is it?

907
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,700
Oh, wait, no, you're right.

908
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,920
Wait, what's the point of going here?

909
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,600
Wait, let's see...

910
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
I don't think there is anything else we need to do.

911
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,220
Okay, we have to find all the wild gems.

912
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,020
Yeah, no, these are collectibles.

913
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,300
Yeah, but then, like, why the fuck did...

914
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm eating my book right now.

915
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,280
Who needs that read?

916
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,660
Reads for losers.

917
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,300
Reads for nerds.

918
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,640
We ain't no nerds.

919
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,580
Wait, does that mean we just have to talk to them again?

920
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,500
Talk to Simba again?

921
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,420
Simba, hurry up.

922
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,520
We wanna kill your dad.

923
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,260
What if we already did everything we need to do?

924
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,760
There's no way.

925
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,080
Except we have to find the collectibles and stuff.

926
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,220
There's no way Simba is supposed to grow up.

927
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm pretty sure he's supposed to grow up.

928
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,960
We've explored the jungle.

929
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,440
No, we haven't actually.

930
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,820
In the jungle...

931
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,520
We gotta find the hidden hyenas.

932
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,820
Oh my God, this is kind of crazy.

933
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,740
Alright, I'm talking to Simba.

934
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,300
I bet I'm right.

935
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh no, there's a stuck zebra.

936
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,780
There's a zebra.

937
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,600
Oh my God.

938
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Alright, I'm talking to them.

939
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,880
Save him.

940
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,300
Let him die as a circle of life.

941
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,520
Okay.

942
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,580
This also keeps going on about Nala and I being betrothed.

943
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,840
I can't marry her, she's my best friend.

944
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,340
Wait, already?

945
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah, I said that earlier.

946
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,160
Yeah.

947
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Wait, what the fuck?

948
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,760
Is that not the jungle that we went through?

949
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,440
That has to be the jungle, right?

950
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,640
It is, but I think there's way more of the jungle.

951
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,330
Oh, maybe...

952
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,920
I've explored all the jungle already.

953
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,800
Oh my God, all of it?

954
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,380
I hear the wild whispers of the dazzling leap.

955
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,000
Leap.

956
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm in the jungle.

957
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,820
Whispers of a leap?

958
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,120
What the hell are you talking about?

959
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,980
Do you think if we do the mini-game again, it unlocks the jungle?

960
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,040
Oh, maybe.

961
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,520
Wait, hold on before you do.

962
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,060
Yeah, I'm like...

963
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,200
How do I do this?

964
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,120
I'm in the jungle too.

965
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,400
Oh, I'm in the...

966
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,940
Wait, where's the famous water area for the jungle?

967
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,920
Oh, I found the famous tree!

968
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,560
Wait, are you in the...

969
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,820
The famous Lion King tree.

970
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,080
There's no famous tree.

971
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,220
No, if you don't know...

972
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,080
Oh my God, you're in the gorge.

973
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,080
You want me to...

974
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,500
I'm kinda...

975
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,620
Do you need me to start the game so you can get out of there?

976
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,400
I don't know how to get out of here.

977
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,720
I don't know how to use the power-up.

978
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,020
Use your wand!

979
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,320
Wait, really?

980
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,580
Wait, no, I think that takes you out.

981
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,240
You won't return to...

982
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,200
Yeah, that takes you to the hub.

983
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,000
Wait, if you left-click it though, you get other stuff.

984
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,100
Wait, no you don't.

985
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,040
Oh wait, you do.

986
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,300
Oh, it's the mini-game.

987
00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,820
It teleports to the...

988
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,880
Yeah, it teleports to the mini-game.

989
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,520
Wait, it's the jungle!

990
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,780
I teleported to the jungle!

991
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,620
Oh, I can do that too!

992
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

993
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,260
Use your magic wand!

994
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,440
Alright.

995
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,500
Alright, let's catch some grub.

996
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,040
Alright, we got this.

997
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,220
We're like so much better now.

998
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,160
Yeah, yeah.

999
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,160
Right-click, right-click.

1000
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,800
Interact with them.

1001
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,960
Alright, we're better than them.

1002
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,920
We're literally them, but we're better.

1003
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,660
That's mine.

1004
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,420
That's mine.

1005
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,520
Oh, I got Minecraft music again.

1006
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
No, no, no!

1007
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,160
Bitch!

1008
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,140
We're a team!

1009
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,060
What do you mean, bitch?

1010
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,560
We're a team!

1011
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,680
I wasn't talking to you!

1012
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
I was talking to actual Pumbaa!

1013
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,680
I am actual Pumbaa, what do you mean?

1014
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,240
I am him.

1015
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,260
Oh no, he took...

1016
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,880
Oh, there's a beetle.

1017
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,320
That's right, we're faster than you.

1018
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,320
We're better than you.

1019
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,540
I'm getting so many points.

1020
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:50,940
Me too.

1021
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,820
We have 60...

1022
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,860
Oh my god, we're 65.

1023
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,820
We're literally gonna starve them to death.

1024
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,400
We are sweeping, we are sweeping.

1025
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,660
No, Pumbaa!

1026
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,100
Third time's the charm.

1027
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,780
They're gonna starve.

1028
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,260
They're gonna starve.

1029
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,560
We're gonna eliminate the entire bug population in the jungle.

1030
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,540
Yeah, they'll have nothing.

1031
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,320
They'll have nothing.

1032
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,640
Come on, let me get that one.

1033
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,400
The mighty jungle flies loose tonight.

1034
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,000
Oh my god, we're at 103!

1035
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,000
Alright, we did it.

1036
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,280
We've explored the jungle.

1037
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,280
We got outgrubbed by the rookies.

1038
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,200
That's right!

1039
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,280
Get outgrubbed!

1040
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,600
Yeah, this is what I have to say about that.

1041
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,620
What did I say?

1042
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,420
Transformers, roll out.

1043
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,480
You've become the size of Jabo.

1044
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,900
Autobots, roll out.

1045
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,580
Roll out.

1046
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,880
Alright, okay.

1047
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,660
Wait, follow me though, follow me.

1048
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,600
Oh, I'm following you?

1049
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,460
Oh wait, do you want to go talk to them?

1050
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,360
And I'll try and get the other stuff in the jungle.

1051
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,940
No, you just TP.

1052
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,680
With your magic wand.

1053
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,740
No, there's more back here.

1054
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
There's more back here?

1055
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,940
Yeah, why do you think I fell into the gorge?

1056
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,600
But what does that mean?

1057
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,420
It's not gonna progress the story.

1058
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,920
I don't know, let's go talk to them.

1059
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,480
Oh see, it's the famous bridge.

1060
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,280
It's the Lion King bridge.

1061
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Oh, this is when they go...

1062
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,180
No, it's Hakuna Matata.

1063
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,700
Oh yeah, it's Hakuna Matata.

1064
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,040
I wish I could push you off.

1065
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,440
Wait, you want to see something really dramatic?

1066
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:33,620
No!

1067
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,800
Simba.

1068
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,340
Remember who you are.

1069
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,600
Wait, can I die in here?

1070
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,140
I wonder.

1071
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,940
I'm gonna try and drown myself.

1072
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,020
Let's see what happens.

1073
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,200
Remember who you are.

1074
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,060
Wait, wait, wait, before we die.

1075
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
I'm dying and I'm...

1076
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,660
I'm dying while I emote.

1077
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,340
Wait, I'm healing at the same time though.

1078
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,540
Wait, you're right.

1079
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,540
Oh, I think we're on this cause...

1080
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,900
Wait, no, no, we can out-damage the heals.

1081
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,240
I'm dying!

1082
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,640
Oh, we're back home.

1083
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,700
We're back in the jungle.

1084
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,760
Oh, we're back in the jungle.

1085
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,480
Back home.

1086
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,660
I don't want to live here.

1087
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,680
I don't understand.

1088
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,960
Why won't it let us get out?

1089
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,320
Wait, there's more to the jungle.

1090
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,020
There's a pathway here.

1091
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,440
Have you been listening to anything?

1092
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,740
Hey look, there's the famous Lion King bridge.

1093
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,460
It's a fucking groundhog day.

1094
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,460
Yeah, we're restarting the day cause we died.

1095
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,160
I'm like going deep in the jungle.

1096
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,200
I think I...

1097
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,520
I don't want to live in Pride Rock anymore.

1098
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,320
But wait, I'm hitting...

1099
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,440
I'm hitting the invisible wall though.

1100
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,530
I don't understand.

1101
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:20,110
We did...

1102
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,430
Oh, is it cause we talked to Timon and Pumbaa too fast?

1103
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,810
The game was like you were not supposed to talk to them yet.

1104
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,470
Oh, maybe.

1105
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,830
Or is this the jungle?

1106
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,870
Wait, there's a black zebra.

1107
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:33,850
Oh, it's just a gazelle.

1108
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,250
Oh my God.

1109
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,190
Wait, aren't zebras originally black with white stripes?

1110
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,170
I remember, somebody like shaved...

1111
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,910
They like...

1112
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,430
They're like...

1113
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,510
They shaved a zebra and they're like...

1114
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,750
The stripes, the white stripes are the fur.

1115
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,610
Why are you laughing?

1116
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,490
It's true!

1117
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,130
Why?

1118
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,110
It's true!

1119
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,530
They are!

1120
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,630
Why are you laughing?

1121
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,070
Wait, I'm stuck behind an invisible wall.

1122
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,890
I think I'm...

1123
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,530
I think I'm trapped for real.

1124
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:15,690
It's alright.

1125
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,970
Just use your magic wand.

1126
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:17,490
I got it.

1127
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:18,770
Okay, I'm out.

1128
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,470
Use your magic wand.

1129
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,030
Are you gonna go talk to...

1130
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,970
Yeah, I'll talk to them again.

1131
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,310
I think we broke the game.

1132
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,650
I think we're never gonna see Mufasa die.

1133
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:27,290
What?

1134
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,430
They don't think children will sequence break?

1135
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,410
Like, come on.

1136
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,810
We'll never see Mufasa die.

1137
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,430
That's fine.

1138
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:39,290
It's so...

1139
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,590
It's like literally the only thing I asked for.

1140
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,210
That's...

1141
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,030
I know you wanted a brother.

1142
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:45,850
I always wanted a brother.

1143
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,950
Just like you.

1144
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:48,810
No!

1145
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,850
It's cause we sequence break!

1146
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,150
We're never gonna see...

1147
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,210
I think so.

1148
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,870
We're never gonna see Mufasa die.

1149
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,050
I don't think they probably have him die.

1150
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,850
I'm pretty sure we could have seen him die.

1151
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,410
Like, why would he...

1152
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,850
Why would he, like, you know...

1153
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,550
He would, like, dissolve into little Minecraft dust particles.

1154
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,950
You know, like the Minecraft story where the pig just...

1155
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,150
Piggyback.

1156
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,890
Have you ever seen a Minecraft...

1157
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,030
Infamous Minecraft story from Telltale's game?

1158
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,530
Where, like, the pig...

1159
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,770
It was, like, an emotional moment.

1160
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,390
And then the pig just fucking dies.

1161
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,690
And turns into pork.

1162
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,570
Wait, you've never seen that video?

1163
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:26,870
Okay, wait.

1164
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,550
I'm gonna kidnap a hyena real quick.

1165
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,350
I found a hyena.

1166
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,210
Oh, where did you find one?

1167
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,370
I'm in the hyena territory.

1168
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,210
You know, like...

1169
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,670
They're like, the light doesn't touch us.

1170
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,290
Don't go there.

1171
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:36,870
I'm there.

1172
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:37,430
Oh, yeah.

1173
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:38,050
Wait, guys.

1174
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,150
How do you use this?

1175
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,610
Do you know?

1176
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,490
I can't believe you've never seen that video before.

1177
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,430
It's so good.

1178
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,510
I don't consume Minecraft content.

1179
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:47,810
I'm kidnapping this hyena.

1180
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,770
You're mine now.

1181
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,070
How do I get this?

1182
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,470
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1183
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,430
Why would the compass work?

1184
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:55,170
Oh.

1185
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,270
I found another thing.

1186
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:57,670
Oh, my God.

1187
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:58,450
I found the hyenas.

1188
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,850
I found where they live.

1189
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,150
Wait, what the fuck is this?

1190
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,150
What's an ability you don't have yet?

1191
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:03,470
Oh.

1192
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:03,990
Oh!

1193
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,740
Hello.

1194
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,520
Man inside doesn't want to talk to me.

1195
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,960
She's too good for me.

1196
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,600
Oh, they're all like...

1197
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,980
Oh, there's this ability we don't have yet.

1198
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,560
Okay, let me send...

1199
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,660
I'm gonna send you the...

1200
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,380
I'm sending...

1201
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,340
Oh, my other game.

1202
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,040
Oh, fuck.

1203
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,800
Did you...

1204
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,300
Did you game crash?

1205
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,180
No, I remember what I said every time I tab out.

1206
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,160
Oh, my God.

1207
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,120
Okay, okay, okay.

1208
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:31,460
Wait, wait.

1209
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:31,800
All right.

1210
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,700
I'm in the dressing room so I can show you.

1211
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,020
Okay.

1212
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,440
Minecraft story pig.

1213
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,940
I can't believe you've never seen this before.

1214
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,030
Minecraft story pig.

1215
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,340
Minecraft story pig.

1216
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,020
Minecraft story pig.

1217
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,120
It's so good.

1218
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,040
It is so good.

1219
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,280
It better be.

1220
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:56,740
It better be.

1221
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,860
It's actually...

1222
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,020
It's so good.

1223
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,560
It's one of the best...

1224
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,820
One of the best scenes ever.

1225
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,500
I'm kidnapping a hyena.

1226
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,800
Are you kidnapping a hyena?

1227
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,220
Okay.

1228
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:06,780
Yeah.

1229
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,520
Oh, my God.

1230
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,700
Why is it four minutes long?

1231
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,480
Why?

1232
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,380
It's four minutes long.

1233
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,020
We only have two more hyenas to kidnap.

1234
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,520
Okay, wait.

1235
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,500
I need to find...

1236
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,260
I need to find the shortest video.

1237
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:18,780
I can't...

1238
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,300
I cannot watch.

1239
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
Let's do Markiplier Reacts.

1240
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,800
Markiplier Reacts.

1241
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,220
I'm gonna kidnap another hyena.

1242
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,440
What the hell is that?

1243
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,220
Watch this.

1244
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:38,980
Are you in the realm?

1245
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,220
Oh, my God.

1246
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,060
God damn it.

1247
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,000
God damn it.

1248
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,020
Okay, I'm back in.

1249
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,880
I'm in the realm.

1250
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,520
I'm in the realm.

1251
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,600
I'm with the hyenas.

1252
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,680
Wait, watch the video.

1253
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,300
Oh, I just saw you.

1254
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:52,740
I see you.

1255
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,260
Wait, you're Steve again?

1256
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,380
Oh, am I Steve again?

1257
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,080
God damn it.

1258
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,500
Let me...

1259
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:56,980
Don't worry.

1260
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,700
Don't worry.

1261
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,860
I'll be Sans.

1262
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,480
And then...

1263
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,180
Am I Sans?

1264
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:03,480
Okay.

1265
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:03,820
There you go.

1266
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,500
Yeah, you're Sans.

1267
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,500
And then, I'll be...

1268
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,340
Pumbaa.

1269
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:08,960
Oh, wait.

1270
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,440
There's hyenas.

1271
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,120
We can talk to them.

1272
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,360
No, they don't talk to you.

1273
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,280
They don't acknowledge you.

1274
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,180
What?

1275
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,320
Bastards.

1276
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,040
Okay, you...

1277
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,760
Well, well, Banzai.

1278
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,960
What have we got here?

1279
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,140
Wait, they talk to you?

1280
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,660
I don't know, Shinzy.

1281
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,620
But I'd say it's trespassers.

1282
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1283
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,080
Wait.

1284
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,360
We'd love you to stick around for dinner.

1285
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,760
You talk to me?

1286
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,040
Yeah, maybe we could get those...

1287
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,200
Well, you know...

1288
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,920
Maybe you need to be more personable.

1289
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,000
Oh my god.

1290
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm Pumbaa.

1291
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,100
How much more personable can I be?

1292
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,480
I'm rizzing them.

1293
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,940
Maybe we could get those little lion cubs we saw to join us if they're lying around.

1294
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,500
Wait, wait, wait.

1295
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,200
I got one.

1296
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:50,740
I got one.

1297
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,600
Make mine a cub sandwich.

1298
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,780
What do you think?

1299
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,880
I think I'm hungry.

1300
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,220
All this talk of food has me starving.

1301
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,320
Oh, me too.

1302
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,140
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1303
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,340
Dinner.

1304
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,620
Is that it?

1305
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,180
That's all they say?

1306
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,360
Ed doesn't say anything.

1307
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,200
Oh, Ed just...

1308
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,900
That's not fair.

1309
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,460
Oh, wait.

1310
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,260
Oh, I just had to talk to her.

1311
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,600
And then she talks.

1312
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,880
You're Steve again.

1313
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,780
I'm Steve again?

1314
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,560
Yeah, I had to...

1315
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,020
I got kicked out and then...

1316
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,340
Oh.

1317
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,720
Yeah, I tabbed out.

1318
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,920
Guys, now I know why people don't play Bedrock.

1319
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,240
It doesn't do anything for me.

1320
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,640
All right.

1321
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,320
You know what?

1322
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,380
Wait, should we do...

1323
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,760
Let's try to go creative mode.

1324
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,400
How do you do that?

1325
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,420
I think like...

1326
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,600
Return to the hub?

1327
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,640
Wait, mode slash...

1328
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,320
What's the mode?

1329
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:42,880
Mode...

1330
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,080
No, I think I remember.

1331
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,660
When you make this, it doesn't allow you to do...

1332
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,400
Wait, really?

1333
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,080
Yeah, because I tried to add them.

1334
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,220
No, wait.

1335
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,860
Oh, wait, wait.

1336
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:53,900
Slash...

1337
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,500
Oh, I can.

1338
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,040
I can.

1339
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:55,820
I think.

1340
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,280
Oh, you can?

1341
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:56,880
Slash...

1342
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,120
I have to be the operator, right?

1343
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:58,320
What is it?

1344
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,580
What is it?

1345
00:51:59,520 --> 00:51:59,920
Mode...

1346
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,440
Try, try, try.

1347
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,000
What is it?

1348
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,620
Game mode.

1349
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,520
Game mode.

1350
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,280
Game rules?

1351
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,380
I don't know how it is on Bedrock.

1352
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:10,980
Wait, what is it?

1353
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,540
Slash...

1354
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,300
Game mode.

1355
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,260
Cheats are allowed.

1356
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:14,660
No!

1357
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,720
See, see, see.

1358
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,780
Wait, I should be allowed to...

1359
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,000
I should be able to edit this.

1360
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,700
I think Disney is like...

1361
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,560
Disney is like, no, no, no.

1362
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,880
No, no, no.

1363
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,600
Why are you cheating?

1364
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,380
No, no, no.

1365
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,620
No.

1366
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,860
You know what?

1367
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,620
I'm gonna...

1368
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,200
I'm gonna teleport to...

1369
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,980
I'm gonna go to...

1370
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,140
Oh.

1371
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,060
Cheats aren't fine and played on me.

1372
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,080
Wait, I'm back in the hub.

1373
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:39,880
Where did you go?

1374
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,960
I'm in Lion King.

1375
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,220
You're still there?

1376
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:44,640
Oh.

1377
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:45,840
Yeah.

1378
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,300
I'm here now.

1379
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,920
Okay, I'll leave.

1380
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,240
Is there nothing else to do here?

1381
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,380
Oh, wait.

1382
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,740
I can activate cheats?

1383
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,200
How?

1384
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,180
Wait, I think if we go into sandbox mode, maybe?

1385
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,880
Wait, okay, friend...

1386
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,280
Oh, I activated friendly fire.

1387
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,840
Oh, you did?

1388
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:02,960
Oh, I activated cheats.

1389
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,920
Wait, I found the last hyena!

1390
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,440
I activated cheats.

1391
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,180
Yeah.

1392
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,980
Okay, uh...

1393
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,120
Game mode...

1394
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:10,940
Creative.

1395
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,080
Your game mode has been successfully updated.

1396
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,660
I'm flying.

1397
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,640
What?

1398
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,120
In the jungle...

1399
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,180
The mighty jungle...

1400
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,660
A lion sleeps tonight.

1401
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,200
Where are you?

1402
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,800
Where are you?

1403
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,280
In the jungle...

1404
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,600
The mighty...

1405
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,420
Remember who you are.

1406
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:35,740
Where are you?

1407
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,480
Are you looking at me?

1408
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,320
No, I'm trying to...

1409
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,260
Oh, wait, I see you.

1410
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:39,880
I see you.

1411
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:43,420
Remember who you are.

1412
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,940
Okay, game mode...

1413
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,740
I'm gonna give you...

1414
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,780
I'm gonna see if I can give you...

1415
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1416
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,100
Where are you, though?

1417
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,300
Where are you?

1418
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,100
Just go down.

1419
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,420
Where are you?

1420
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,020
I don't see you.

1421
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:02,860
Turn around.

1422
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,100
In the jungle...

1423
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,100
The mighty jungle...

1424
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,920
The lion...

1425
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,920
I can't hurt you!

1426
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,500
This is so fucked up.

1427
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,100
The lion sleeps tonight...

1428
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:19,900
Yes!

1429
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,400
In the jungle...

1430
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,880
I can't go back.

1431
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,040
Wait, what happened?

1432
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:27,920
Where did you go?

1433
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,320
Where did you go?

1434
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,420
You like, TP'd me.

1435
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,860
Wait, no, I'm still in the jungle.

1436
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,760
Wait, can I kill Mufasa?

1437
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,380
Are you trying to kill Mufasa?

1438
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,460
Wait, can you?

1439
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,120
I'll kill him now.

1440
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,220
Wait, can you push him?

1441
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,900
Can you push him?

1442
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,680
No, I'm doing something better.

1443
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,900
In the jungle...

1444
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,900
The mighty jungle...

1445
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,800
Long live the...

1446
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,300
Look, he's begging for it.

1447
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,600
Long live the king.

1448
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,300
He's breaking his neck to get it.

1449
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,700
Long live the king.

1450
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,340
Do it already!

1451
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,880
Oh my god, he's invincible!

1452
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,740
Wait, with this we might actually be able to push him to the...

1453
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:36,260
To the gorge, and then we can have him actually fall down and die.

1454
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,960
Can we push him?

1455
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,780
Oh yeah, I definitely could get hurt from that.

1456
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,380
How do we push him?

1457
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,980
With the water!

1458
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh, with the water?

1459
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,720
Okay, we gotta make a tunnel to it.

1460
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,980
Where's the gorge?

1461
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,780
It's over this way, I think.

1462
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,080
Oh my god, so far.

1463
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,300
Oh, we gotta put him in a boat!

1464
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,620
Okay, let me get the boat.

1465
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,960
Mufasa, we're gonna recreate history.

1466
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,300
What's that over there?

1467
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,360
Something's glowing.

1468
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,360
What is that, you guys?

1469
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,340
Oh my god, it's on the boat!

1470
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,260
Wait, wait, wait.

1471
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,260
Get rid of the...

1472
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,060
What the heck?

1473
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,080
Oh my god, I gotta get rid of this lava.

1474
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,420
Use a bucket, use a bucket.

1475
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh, this thing.

1476
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,200
No, no, no, no.

1477
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,180
Alright, there we go.

1478
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,680
Oh, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

1479
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,200
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!

1480
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:37,920
Stop, stop!

1481
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,600
Where did you go?

1482
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,900
Oh god, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

1483
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,340
Use your magic wand, use your magic wand!

1484
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:43,960
I'm trying!

1485
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,600
I'm trying not to use it!

1486
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
Okay, I'm fine.

1487
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,840
Are you okay?

1488
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,860
I don't think you're fine.

1489
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,660
I'm fine, everything's good.

1490
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,560
Alright, I'm okay too.

1491
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,760
Get in the boat, Mufasa.

1492
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,440
Get in the boat.

1493
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,960
Oh my god, I think I fucked it up.

1494
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:01,900
No!

1495
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,380
Use water to push him in.

1496
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,500
He's not getting on the boat, look at all the boats I have.

1497
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,800
He's not getting in.

1498
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:08,800
Oh no.

1499
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,080
Oh, I got him, I got him in the boat!

1500
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,540
He's in, he's in, he's in!

1501
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,080
And all it took was for me to show up.

1502
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,480
Wait, can I get in the boat?

1503
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,900
Alright, it's time.

1504
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,240
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

1505
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,590
Come on, Mufasa!

1506
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,290
Come on, Mufasa, come on!

1507
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,980
Come on, Mufasa!

1508
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,580
Come on, Mufasa!

1509
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,600
We've kidnapped the king!

1510
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:03,420
We're gonna finish the job, do something Scar could never do.

1511
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,680
Should we bring Scar?

1512
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,760
No, he's too far.

1513
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,940
What if I bring Simba?

1514
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,440
To watch his dad die.

1515
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,660
Watch your dad die, Simba, it's time.

1516
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,120
It's time.

1517
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,660
Wait, I wanna be up higher.

1518
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,000
Don't worry, I'm coming over too.

1519
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,900
I'm coming over, Simba.

1520
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,240
How can we get him up to the top of the gorge?

1521
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,680
Oh, the water, I can bring water over.

1522
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,860
Oh yeah, bring some water and I'll float up it.

1523
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,520
Okay, okay.

1524
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,000
Don't worry,

1525
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,540
I'm bringing Simba too.

1526
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,660
Simba.

1527
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,340
I see you very slowly.

1528
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,800
Wait, I can leash the boat.

1529
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,420
Wait, I can?

1530
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:49,960
Leash.

1531
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,260
Wait, can I actually?

1532
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,580
Simba.

1533
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,360
Can I leash you up?

1534
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,560
But you went inside one of these paths, you can't go in here.

1535
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,880
Okay, it's time.

1536
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,300
You roll, I pour water.

1537
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,720
Okay.

1538
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:09,480
Okay,

1539
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:12,940
there we go.

1540
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,140
Wait, let's try the leash now.

1541
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,640
Maybe it'll work.

1542
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,300
Maybe, yeah.

1543
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,560
Does it work?

1544
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,780
Hold on.

1545
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,700
How do I leash him?

1546
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,040
I think you leash the boat.

1547
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,580
There you go.

1548
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,180
No, it doesn't work.

1549
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:26,820
No, no, no, no.

1550
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,000
I'll just give you a... No, no, you roll, I water.

1551
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,600
Okay, okay.

1552
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,580
Wait, I wanna go up higher.

1553
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:39,020
It's time to watch your dad die, Simba.

1554
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,960
Okay, okay, okay.

1555
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,580
Go to the top of that hill.

1556
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:47,320
Yeah.

1557
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:47,800
Up here.

1558
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:48,240
Yeah.

1559
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,800
And let the water run down and see if we can get it up here.

1560
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:52,860
Up here?

1561
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1562
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,360
Alright, come on, Mufasa.

1563
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
Let's try going up.

1564
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:06,860
The lion sleeps tonight in the jungle.

1565
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,660
The mighty jungle...

1566
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,260
Mufasa!

1567
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,220
Mufasa!

1568
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,540
Mufasa!

1569
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,100
Mufasa, too soon!

1570
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,120
Too soon, Mufasa!

1571
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,780
The mighty jungle...

1572
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,940
Stop sending water!

1573
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,420
Stop sending water!

1574
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,840
The mighty... The lion sleeps tonight...

1575
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,380
Not yet!

1576
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,000
Not yet!

1577
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,760
I want him to fall from the absolute tallest spot.

1578
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,960
You gotta roll up.

1579
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,360
I'm trying!

1580
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,100
Oh my...

1581
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,520
I'm putting more water.

1582
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,500
No more water!

1583
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,420
No more water.

1584
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,120
Oh god.

1585
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:51,900
Okay, here we go.

1586
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,280
Here we go.

1587
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:52,880
Okay.

1588
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,620
Oh, oh.

1589
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,980
Oh gosh, I was so close.

1590
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,060
At least it didn't work, you guys.

1591
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,880
Oh, I'm close.

1592
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,180
I'm close.

1593
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,500
I'm close.

1594
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,940
Is he still with me?

1595
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,300
No.

1596
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,820
The new ocean in the Sahara.

1597
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,560
Get rid of some of the water!

1598
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,060
Get rid of some of the water!

1599
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,150
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1600
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:25,210
We're creating an ocean in Africa.

1601
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:31,510
Simba.

1602
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,930
Long live the king.

1603
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,750
Long live the king.

1604
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,350
Why am I going down with him?

1605
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,130
Long live the king!

1606
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,860
You see that, Simba?

1607
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,860
You see that?

1608
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,480
You see your dad killed your dad.

1609
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,900
Remember these faces.

1610
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,200
Timon and Pumbaa.

1611
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,600
Killed your dad.

1612
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,780
Killed your dad so now you can be your gay husband.

1613
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,480
Gay fathers.

1614
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,100
Someone just said try TNT on them.

1615
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,340
That's right.

1616
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,520
We killed your dad so we can adopt you.

1617
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,280
That's right.

1618
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,140
Get the TNT.

1619
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,820
Get the TNT and blow him up.

1620
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,640
Goodbye, Mufasa.

1621
01:02:59,360 --> 01:02:59,840
Wait,

1622
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,200
wait, wait.

1623
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,260
Can I go to the other side?

1624
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1625
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,020
Pure cinema.

1626
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:15,980
Yeah, pure cinema.

1627
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,900
We'll know now.

1628
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,420
I'll tell you when I'm there.

1629
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,280
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1630
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,240
Let me get to the top.

1631
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,200
I'm slow, I'm slow.

1632
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,060
It's all the water.

1633
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,000
This movie is different from what I remember.

1634
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,580
We're doing what Scar couldn't.

1635
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,400
From Timon and Pumbaa.

1636
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,200
Okay.

1637
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,460
Light her up.

1638
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,460
I lit it up.

1639
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,240
He lived!

1640
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,400
Oh my god, he lived!

1641
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,540
I thought it would like shoot him up into the air.

1642
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,140
Yeah, me too.

1643
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,300
I thought so too.

1644
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,380
Oh man.

1645
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,780
Well, that was great.

1646
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,180
It was great visiting Lion King.

1647
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,220
Yeah.

1648
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,740
Now I'm gonna burn the forest.

1649
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,240
Oh shit.

1650
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,040
Wait, there's water.

1651
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,060
There's water.

1652
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:15,360
Wait, where's the water?

1653
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,840
I'm burning Africa down.

1654
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,660
Goodbye, planes.

1655
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,340
Goodbye, planes.

1656
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,580
Oh my god, they're just walking right through it.

1657
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:29,620
Goodbye.

1658
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,920
Wait, these aren't even real trees.

1659
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,580
They're not even...

1660
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,240
They don't even light up.

1661
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,140
Wait, they're not even real trees.

1662
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,200
Where are we?

1663
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,940
Oh yeah, this is apparently a dream.

1664
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,720
This is Disney magic.

1665
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,220
We're in Simba's nightmare right now.

1666
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:53,400
This is what he replays, except he remembers his dad died.

1667
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,460
But it also includes fire all around.

1668
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,500
Fire and Timon and Pumbaa.

1669
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,280
I can reset the world so we can do creative one versus the other ones.

1670
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,300
Okay.

1671
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,960
Alright, let me reset the world.

1672
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,880
It's like nothing happened.

1673
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,480
It's like we didn't terrorize the planes.

1674
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,140
I'll reset the world.

1675
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:23,740
Wait, get out of the world.

1676
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,720
I'll reset it.

1677
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:25,720
Hold on.

1678
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,540
Are you enjoying Minecraft?

1679
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,800
Wait, so like leave, leave?

1680
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,640
Yeah, leave, leave and I'll reset it.

1681
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,640
Let's see, how do I destroy this?

1682
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:36,320
Okay.

1683
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,460
Okay, manage realm.

1684
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,300
Oh my god, wait, how do I...

1685
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,820
Guys, this is my first time going through this.

1686
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,040
Yeah, this is Kingdom Hearts 4.

1687
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,460
Alright, let's see.

1688
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:59,940
How do I destroy this world as if nothing happened?

1689
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,000
As if we didn't kill everything.

1690
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,040
Disactivated.

1691
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,420
Wait, can you just make a new realm?

1692
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,040
Yeah, I could.

1693
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,560
I want to destroy this realm though.

1694
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,180
I don't want this realm anymore.

1695
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,820
Oh wait, it's here.

1696
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,360
You discovered the Badlands.

1697
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,880
I assumed that was...

1698
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,040
I assumed that one was like...

1699
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,120
Yeah, that one's our realm.

1700
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,180
How do I destroy you?

1701
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,420
I want to destroy.

1702
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,440
Okay, edit world.

1703
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,040
Fetching realm.

1704
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,820
Oh, I can restore the world!

1705
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,240
To what it was like.

1706
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,380
I don't want to restore.

1707
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,540
I want to destroy it.

1708
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,840
Fetching realm...

1709
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,980
I'm trying to figure it out!

1710
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,640
Why doesn't it let me destroy you?

1711
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,980
Okay, create new.

1712
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,640
Okay, play on realms.

1713
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,260
Here.

1714
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,460
I did it.

1715
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,860
I'm destroying the realm as if it never happened.

1716
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,340
What we did...

1717
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,880
It's like we never terrorized this area.

1718
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,000
Delete the vod.

1719
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,600
Yeah, we didn't try to kill Mufasa.

1720
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:09,780
We didn't.

1721
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,440
I'm gonna change.

1722
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,600
No one will know my crime.

1723
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,440
I'm a solid creeper.

1724
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,300
No one will know my crime.

1725
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,600
No one will know.

1726
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:28,660
I don't know why I have these.

1727
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,980
I didn't buy them, so I don't know why I have them.

1728
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,220
Oh, solid creeper?

1729
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,480
Yeah, I recreated it.

1730
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:35,620
Alright.

1731
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,440
Oh, you did?

1732
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,000
Send me in.

1733
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,480
Wait, add realm members.

1734
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:42,620
Invite.

1735
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:43,980
There you go, did you get it?

1736
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,880
Let me see.

1737
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,460
Yeah.

1738
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:48,400
Alright.

1739
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,160
It's like...

1740
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,000
We didn't destroy this realm.

1741
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,160
It's like we never...

1742
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,100
Wait, I love...

1743
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:57,800
Wait.

1744
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,600
I'm gonna be a new skin.

1745
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,880
You're gonna be a new skin?

1746
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,560
Bonjour, Mephisele.

1747
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,480
This is a great pride.

1748
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,920
Do the Tetris.

1749
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,620
Do the Tetris.

1750
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,100
Okay.

1751
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,120
Okay, I wanna be Disney too.

1752
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,380
Let's see.

1753
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,460
It is a great pleasure.

1754
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,500
Oh wait, I can change the set.

1755
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,980
Wait, let me add...

1756
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,560
What is it?

1757
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:38,780
Red leaf fire.

1758
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,280
Okay.

1759
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,100
Oh, did I not save it?

1760
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,900
Red leaf fire.

1761
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,560
A beast!

1762
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,840
Oh my god, it's a beast!

1763
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,860
Unlock all worlds, alright.

1764
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,740
Unlocked all worlds.

1765
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,200
Oh my god.

1766
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh my god, she's going beast mode!

1767
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,960
Oh god, which is that?

1768
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,220
Oh my god, we unlocked everything.

1769
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:12,300
Aladdin!

1770
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,900
This is the record book.

1771
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,860
Why is it successfully executed?

1772
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,920
Do you have that successfully executed six function entries?

1773
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:24,860
Do you have?

1774
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,080
Oh my god, what does that mean?

1775
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,600
What does that mean?

1776
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,600
This is a successfully...

1777
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,880
I thought it was because I was...

1778
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,720
On my chat.

1779
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,580
I thought it was because...

1780
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,880
Oh, function six is clocking someone in the face?

1781
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,520
Oh, it's because I hit you.

1782
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,540
That's why I have it.

1783
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,540
You hit me, I hit you too much.

1784
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:54,420
Oh, I have all the game info on?

1785
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,480
How do I turn that off?

1786
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,800
They're not all unlocked.

1787
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,320
Yeah, they are.

1788
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,380
That's weird.

1789
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,240
They should be.

1790
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,760
What is this?

1791
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,200
Oh, shit, sorry.

1792
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:16,720
Where are we?

1793
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,060
Oh, we're in the breeze!

1794
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,320
The breeze!

1795
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,040
Oh my god, it's Gusto!

1796
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,640
Oh, game.

1797
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,300
Oh, it's because I had this.

1798
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,720
Game rule.

1799
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,600
It's because I had that.

1800
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,100
Oh my god, what did I do?

1801
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:58,020
Oh my god!

1802
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,600
Oh my god, what did I do?

1803
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,860
I broke my game.

1804
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:05,880
What did I do?

1805
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,360
What did you do?

1806
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,900
I broke my game.

1807
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,940
I'm trying to fix my game right now.

1808
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,400
No, stop!

1809
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,680
I broke my game!

1810
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,760
If you die, you might live.

1811
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,160
You might be back to normal.

1812
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,880
No, that's not how it works!

1813
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:21,940
No!

1814
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,480
I broke my game!

1815
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:26,860
Lumiere!

1816
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:27,180
Lumiere!

1817
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:27,640
Lumiere!

1818
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:29,880
No!

1819
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,100
Stop!

1820
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,200
Are you dying at all?

1821
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,000
No, I don't know.

1822
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,360
I'm trying to fix my game right now.

1823
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,860
Chat, I can't.

1824
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,420
No, I still can't get out.

1825
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,280
Somebody fix my chat!

1826
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,440
What are you talking about?

1827
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,040
My chat, it's broken!

1828
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,600
Somebody fix my chat!

1829
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,540
All I see is the game rules!

1830
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,980
What did I do?

1831
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,740
How did this happen to me?

1832
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,200
I'm going to kill you!

1833
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:14,660
Don't worry!

1834
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,480
I'm going to kill you!

1835
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,520
Don't worry, you'll die!

1836
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,740
You'll die and then you'll be reborn!

1837
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,500
Don't worry, it's working!

1838
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,300
Don't worry, I'll kill you!

1839
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,640
I'll kill you!

1840
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,660
Did it work?

1841
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:29,860
Did it work?

1842
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,200
Did it work?

1843
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,580
You saw nothing.

1844
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,020
No!

1845
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,820
The beast!

1846
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,080
It didn't work.

1847
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,840
I don't know what's going on.

1848
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,220
All I see is my chat.

1849
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,700
My chat commands.

1850
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,000
That's all I see!

1851
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,500
Did you try escape?

1852
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,420
Did I try escape?

1853
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,320
There you are!

1854
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,500
You look capable!

1855
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,380
Join me!

1856
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,300
We're going to storm the castle and slay the hideous beast!

1857
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,400
Did he actually say that?

1858
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,200
Oh my god, but you're the beast!

1859
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:03,940
I know!

1860
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,940
So we can rescue the girl!

1861
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,680
Who's going to be my wife!

1862
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,140
The most beautiful Belle!

1863
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,560
It will be your honor!

1864
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:15,180
A mighty honor, I'd say!

1865
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,460
Yes, LeFou, very mighty!

1866
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,700
Meet me at the edge of the village.

1867
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,860
We'll set out from there, onward!

1868
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,500
Yeah, onward!

1869
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,920
Oh my god, did we get to kill Gaston?

1870
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,780
Oh my god, are we going to kill him?

1871
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,360
Bye, Gaston!

1872
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:29,880
Goodbye!

1873
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,960
Wait, what if I restart my game?

1874
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,840
Will it fix everything?

1875
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:35,780
I'll fix you.

1876
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,080
What I see is like...

1877
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,560
I can't see half my screen.

1878
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,220
That's...

1879
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,900
I don't know when I broke the game.

1880
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,440
I thought this was blood.

1881
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,000
I thought this was blood spots.

1882
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:57,480
Bonjour!

1883
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:58,280
Bonjour!

1884
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,980
I need six eggs!

1885
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,380
That's too expensive!

1886
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:07,610
It must be worth it in provincial life!

1887
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:11,990
That's what I'm going to make of my life!

1888
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,550
That's what I'm going to make of my life!

1889
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:13,770
That's what I'm going to make of my life!

1890
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:14,310
Guys, it didn't work.

1891
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:19,020
What the fuck?

1892
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,940
Oh my god, he looks like...

1893
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:24,760
Wait, where are you?

1894
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,640
I'm at the edge of the village.

1895
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:27,940
Oh, I'm heading over there.

1896
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:31,620
It looks like...

1897
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:39,080
I'm gonna go into Belle's room and sniff her sheets.

1898
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,200
You're gonna what?

1899
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:44,060
What are you gonna do?

1900
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,500
Where are you?

1901
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,160
I'm trying to fix my game.

1902
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:48,560
Still?

1903
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,120
I don't understand, it's so bad.

1904
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,820
She's the most beautiful girl.

1905
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,500
You have to.

1906
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,100
You only get one chance to do that.

1907
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,780
Can I ride the horse?

1908
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,080
Please, somebody...

1909
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:03,740
Free me!

1910
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,420
Free me!

1911
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,340
Free me!

1912
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,260
Free me!

1913
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,200
Here, once you're good...

1914
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,060
I have a...

1915
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:15,120
I have a ride for us.

1916
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,500
Wait, are you in Belle's house?

1917
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,160
I'm...

1918
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:19,800
Are you in here?

1919
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:22,520
I'm heading over to Belle's house right now.

1920
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,200
I see Belle's dad.

1921
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,820
Yeah, that's Belle's dad.

1922
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,360
Wait, where are you?

1923
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,440
I do not see you.

1924
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,980
Wait, I got a collectible.

1925
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,220
I do too.

1926
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,640
I already got that.

1927
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,020
Wait, where are you?

1928
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,460
I'm right in front of Belle's house.

1929
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,400
They got another...

1930
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,340
Command rule for me to try out.

1931
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,380
Why is this so scuffed?

1932
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:47,000
You have to see what I have to go through.

1933
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,420
Your game is cursed.

1934
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,860
Wait, I think it's fixed.

1935
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:53,740
No, it's not.

1936
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,840
I still don't see you.

1937
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,680
No, it's not.

1938
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,480
I fixed it!

1939
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:58,860
It's fixed!

1940
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,700
Oh my god, I get to see my screen!

1941
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,360
Oh my god!

1942
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,540
Okay, we figured it out.

1943
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,960
I'm with a horse right now.

1944
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:07,640
Wait, where are you?

1945
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,160
Wait, where are you?

1946
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,460
I'm in front of Belle's house.

1947
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,260
I'm in front of Belle's house too.

1948
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,220
Hello?

1949
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:18,600
Hello?

1950
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,280
You're here.

1951
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,160
The beast?

1952
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,180
Okay, do you see Belle's dad?

1953
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,200
I'm at the village farm.

1954
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,480
Sorry, I'm not at her house.

1955
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,360
I'm at the village farm.

1956
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,260
Oh shit!

1957
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,780
Oh my god, you're so far.

1958
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,580
Where are you?

1959
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,100
I'm gonna head over to Belle.

1960
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,260
Okay, head over to Belle's dad.

1961
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,760
Belle's dad?

1962
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,740
Yeah, we gotta go talk to Gaston.

1963
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,140
Oh, I see him!

1964
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,020
Oh, I see you!

1965
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:48,880
Hello Steve.

1966
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,820
Wait, am I Steve?

1967
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,480
Yeah.

1968
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,980
Don't worry, the sign's gonna be here for a sec.

1969
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:56,640
And then...

1970
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,300
And then...

1971
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,280
There we go.

1972
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:02,340
Bonjour.

1973
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,360
Mademoiselle.

1974
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,000
What does Belle's dad say?

1975
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,260
I don't know, I didn't talk to him.

1976
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:09,920
I'm gonna talk to him.

1977
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,540
Oh no, how on earth did that happen?

1978
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,700
I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk.

1979
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,360
I'll never get this bone-headed contraption to work.

1980
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,960
That's all he says.

1981
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,360
Oh, alright, goodbye.

1982
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,040
Of course, Lumiere.

1983
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:24,860
Alright, I'll be...

1984
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,480
Look, this time we're not gonna sequence break.

1985
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,520
So we're gonna experience the story.

1986
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:28,960
I'll be in the fall.

1987
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,580
Oh, we can't leave just yet.

1988
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,180
First I must go take care of old Maurice.

1989
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,160
You go ahead and scout for us.

1990
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,660
And then soon I will have Belle for my wife.

1991
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,640
Make no mistake.

1992
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,720
Oh, you don't get a lot.

1993
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,040
Just like the real Maurice.

1994
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:46,820
Let's take the horse.

1995
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,000
Alright, but I can't ride the horse with you.

1996
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,080
You can't?

1997
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:52,700
Can I?

1998
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:53,440
No, I can't.

1999
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,320
We gotta get another horse.

2000
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,540
Wait, there's another horse over there.

2001
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,860
I saw another horse that we can steal.

2002
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,700
This is the way to the castle.

2003
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,360
Oh yeah, I see your horse.

2004
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,680
Yeah, that's my horse.

2005
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:06,440
You thought this was her dad?

2006
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,840
Yeah, I thought that was her dad.

2007
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,700
I was like, there's the dad.

2008
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,380
With beautiful red luscious hair.

2009
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,300
Totally what Belle is known for.

2010
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:19,580
Red luscious hair.

2011
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:20,480
Yeah, yeah.

2012
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,660
She got the brown hair from the mom.

2013
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,540
Wow, there's so many...

2014
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,840
Wait, I'm going the right way, right?

2015
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,680
I don't know, I'm looking at the map right now.

2016
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,760
We're at the forest hills.

2017
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,260
That should be the way.

2018
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,880
Oh, there it is!

2019
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,680
The castle!

2020
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:41,800
Oh, daddy's home.

2021
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:52,670
Why are you in the ground?

2022
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,890
The beast's castle.

2023
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,470
There's Belle over there.

2024
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,390
We did it, Gaston.

2025
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,990
We killed the beast.

2026
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,610
We did it.

2027
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,430
The beast is down.

2028
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,010
You can't be creative for a second.

2029
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:16,830
Just use your magic wand.

2030
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,210
Right click.

2031
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,090
Do you want to return to the hub?

2032
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,670
No, left click, left click.

2033
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:24,830
Just TP to Belle.

2034
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:28,070
TP to the castle kitchen.

2035
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:29,470
No, I don't want to...

2036
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:29,990
Wait, hold on.

2037
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:31,090
I'll be there.

2038
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:34,070
Oh my god, there's me.

2039
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:35,330
There's tiny.

2040
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,090
Hold on.

2041
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,090
Wait for me.

2042
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:41,030
We did it, everybody.

2043
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:42,830
We killed the beast.

2044
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,530
Kill the beast.

2045
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:46,510
Kill the beast.

2046
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:49,270
No, not me.

2047
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:53,610
You got the wrong guy.

2048
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,870
I'm his brother.

2049
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:00,670
You always wanted a brother.

2050
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:00,790
I'm his brother.

2051
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:04,590
Can you bring your horse back?

2052
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:05,730
So I have a horse to...

2053
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:08,090
I have to ride the horse back to you.

2054
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,910
What do I do?

2055
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,330
Just run.

2056
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:14,390
There's gotta be like a third horse.

2057
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,070
Just get over here.

2058
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:19,410
I'm trying.

2059
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,230
Am I going the right way?

2060
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:23,350
I think there might be another way.

2061
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,850
Just open your map.

2062
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:27,690
Just open your map.

2063
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:27,850
What's up?

2064
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,750
I'm going towards a mysterious path.

2065
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:33,790
What the fuck do you mean a mysterious path?

2066
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:35,510
Literally, the next thing is Belle.

2067
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:39,290
I've always wanted a brother.

2068
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:44,870
Couldn't Disney have paid for properly looping music in this game?

2069
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,370
I don't understand.

2070
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:55,350
They could've literally just made like Minecraft music of the soundtrack.

2071
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,790
I see your name.

2072
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,370
I see you too.

2073
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:03,850
This is like copyrighted Minecraft Beauty and the Beast music.

2074
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:04,490
Yeah.

2075
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,630
It's like just legally distinct.

2076
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:12,950
I just got someone with a really interesting name super chatting me.

2077
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:13,950
What is it?

2078
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:16,410
And I want you to confirm or deny.

2079
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:17,770
What is it?

2080
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,890
Eating Doki Bird's ass.

2081
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,070
They gave you money and not me?

2082
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:29,210
They're too busy eating your ass.

2083
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:31,850
Look, look, there's me.

2084
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,370
Oh my god.

2085
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:35,010
I'm going to stand next to you and you won't know who's who.

2086
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:36,150
Who's who?

2087
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:39,230
Oh wait, I actually thought you were...

2088
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:42,390
Who's so right, Lumiere?

2089
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,230
Oh my god.

2090
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:49,890
Wait, can I ride that?

2091
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,010
Wait, can I ride that?

2092
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:55,990
Oh my god, there's a dresser.

2093
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:58,310
You're Sonic running?

2094
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,570
Yeah, I'm Sonic.

2095
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:00,530
You can't ride the star.

2096
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,030
I'll be Lumiere.

2097
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,130
Yeah, you be Lumiere.

2098
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:06,610
Gasp, do my eyes deceive me or do we have a guest?

2099
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:09,250
Oh, you must be soaked to the bone.

2100
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,410
Please, please come in.

2101
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:13,210
You hear me, Cogsworth?

2102
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:13,770
Oh.

2103
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,610
Lumiere, what are you doing?

2104
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,870
We can't let them go back out there.

2105
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:24,650
Please, you must stay.

2106
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:26,110
Be our guest.

2107
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:28,470
He said the thing!

2108
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:30,710
No, no, no.

2109
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:33,070
The master won't like this at all.

2110
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,770
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

2111
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:41,190
Of course, they are welcome here.

2112
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:46,430
Now, let us introduce you to our other esteemed guest.

2113
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,330
Mademoiselle Belle.

2114
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:50,350
She is just over there.

2115
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:51,610
Where?

2116
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:52,590
What does that mean?

2117
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,630
She is under there.

2118
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:59,650
Wait, I think she's at the kitchen.

2119
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,630
Yeah, there she is.

2120
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,610
They put the woman in the kitchen?

2121
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:05,170
Damn.

2122
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:07,930
She's flexing on us.

2123
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:09,930
Wait, I think it's a minigame.

2124
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2125
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:13,130
Be our guest.

2126
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,190
Be our guest.

2127
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:16,850
Put our service to the...

2128
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,030
Oh, you can be Mrs. Potts.

2129
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:20,610
I bet you'd like a nice spot of tea.

2130
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,770
It'll warm you up in no time.

2131
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:25,450
Oh, that's all she says.

2132
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:27,070
Hey, wanna see me do a trick?

2133
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,810
Oh my god, look how tiny he is.

2134
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:30,830
And he does a flip.

2135
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:33,050
What are you talking about, mama?

2136
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,390
What's going on?

2137
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,730
That might not be a cool trick, but can you do this?

2138
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,560
Yeah.

2139
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,380
I'm gonna talk to Belle.

2140
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,320
I'm gonna talk to Belle.

2141
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:48,940
Oh, hello.

2142
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,060
It's very nice to meet you.

2143
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,920
Are you a guest here as well?

2144
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,980
Oh, I see.

2145
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,980
Gaston has sent you to rescue me, has he?

2146
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,620
Of course he'd never ask me what I want.

2147
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,580
Well, you can tell him I'm not in any danger.

2148
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,280
Though I doubt he'd listen.

2149
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,600
Pardon me, Belle.

2150
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,080
I don't think we can finish your surprise dinner in time.

2151
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,340
Our ideas may have been a bit ground.

2152
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:17,500
We would need more help in the kitchen.

2153
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,820
Oh, and do we have another guest?

2154
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:23,580
Yes.

2155
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,140
I'd hope they'd join us.

2156
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:26,480
Oh, but you're right.

2157
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,360
It is getting awfully late.

2158
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:30,820
Hmm.

2159
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,520
I think I have an idea.

2160
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,080
What if I help as well?

2161
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,500
I've read through the recipe book after all.

2162
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:38,720
Oh my god.

2163
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,200
Perhaps you could help us too.

2164
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,740
We could really use another pair of hands.

2165
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,900
I could read out the instructions while you help with the preparations.

2166
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,100
Oh boy, we're good at that.

2167
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,680
Oh yeah, we're so good at reading instructions.

2168
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,880
It's not like we just sequence break the last one.

2169
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:55,880
The horse just walked in.

2170
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,360
He's like, I'm hungry.

2171
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,140
Oh my god.

2172
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,500
How hungry.

2173
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:10,940
How hungry.

2174
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,560
Alright, yeah, let's cook a meal.

2175
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,640
Wonderful, let's get started.

2176
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,920
Okay.

2177
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,160
Belle will tell you what to cook.

2178
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,540
Why does she keep flexing on us?

2179
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,820
I know, what is she doing?

2180
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,660
I don't understand.

2181
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,720
She's styling on us.

2182
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:26,620
Tell you which ingredients.

2183
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,900
Go into the recipe.

2184
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:31,080
Then you can prepare them and place them on the dishes.

2185
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,240
Use ingredients on cooking.

2186
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,900
What the hell, is this overcooked?

2187
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,320
Yeah, I was thinking too.

2188
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,200
Oh god.

2189
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,280
Lumiere will be waiting to take the plates to the dining room.

2190
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:44,980
Oh my god.

2191
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,860
Okay, we can do this.

2192
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,860
Do they need to eat their inanimate objects?

2193
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,200
Yeah, but Belle needs to eat.

2194
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,320
Oh no, first, shall we...

2195
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,820
This calls for baked cheese.

2196
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:55,460
Where's cheese?

2197
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,380
Okay, and put it in the oven.

2198
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,560
Why does the master have to make food?

2199
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,640
You put it in the oven.

2200
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,980
Yeah, that's the oven, right?

2201
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:07,220
That looks like an oven.

2202
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,780
Oh my god, it's actually playing the song!

2203
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:11,700
Wait, is it?

2204
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,360
Wait, I wanna hear it.

2205
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,020
Oh, it is!

2206
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,120
What do we do with this?

2207
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,280
Wait, I think it shows us up here.

2208
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,120
Oh, and then...

2209
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,640
Oh, we're supposed to...

2210
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:30,260
She makes...

2211
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,520
Oh, this is fun!

2212
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,880
What do I do?

2213
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,380
Oh my god, some cheese for you!

2214
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,260
I did it!

2215
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,260
I did it!

2216
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:53,740
Oh my god!

2217
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,980
Grab an apple and combine it with the wheat.

2218
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:56,660
I'm already doing it!

2219
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:57,760
I'm already doing it!

2220
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:59,580
Did you get the wheat?

2221
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,700
Wait, we do our own thing.

2222
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:02,900
Are we competing?

2223
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,100
Oh, we are!

2224
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,240
We're

2225
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:11,860
working together!

2226
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,460
Oh my god, there's two voices!

2227
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:19,980
I'm too distracted.

2228
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,010
Oh my gosh!

2229
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,230
Oh, okay.

2230
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,990
Did that work?

2231
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,010
That's a person.

2232
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:46,610
Oh my god, that's messed up.

2233
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:48,030
Wait, where's the picture?

2234
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:48,830
Oh, there it is.

2235
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:51,710
Wait, huh?

2236
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:54,450
Where's the...

2237
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:54,790
Oh, here.

2238
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,180
Oh, and this.

2239
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,700
What am I...

2240
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,640
What's the other thing I'm getting?

2241
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:11,160
Oh, spices.

2242
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,100
Okay, I got it.

2243
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,240
I figured it out.

2244
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,840
Wait, you already did it?

2245
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:19,520
Oh my god.

2246
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,220
Is that me?

2247
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:24,960
What is that?

2248
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,540
I'm not gonna say.

2249
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,240
We're competing.

2250
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,220
There I say!

2251
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,960
That was magical!

2252
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,860
That was rather fun.

2253
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,160
And we must thank our new friend for the help.

2254
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:39,600
Friend?

2255
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,440
Oh my god, look at her hips.

2256
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,720
Oh my god.

2257
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,320
I can't believe they actually started singing.

2258
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,300
It's because you don't have real plates.

2259
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:54,580
And you only use paper plates.

2260
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,920
I don't think we could've done it without you.

2261
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:01,940
Doki?

2262
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,420
What?

2263
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,120
It still keeps going.

2264
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,080
Belle keeps talking.

2265
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:05,580
Oh.

2266
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,880
Now it's time to end.

2267
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:11,680
But if you'd like to help us practice these recipes again, just let us know.

2268
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:15,880
What is all this?

2269
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,860
And what are they doing here?

2270
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,860
It's alright.

2271
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,620
There's no need to worry.

2272
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,280
We are new friends.

2273
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,160
Help us prepare this feast.

2274
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:28,240
Are you?

2275
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,300
A feast?

2276
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,860
For me?

2277
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:37,460
Yes, I wanted to thank you for helping me escape from those wolves.

2278
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,260
It was my pleasure.

2279
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:46,580
I was worried about how to invite you to dinner.

2280
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,500
Well, I graciously accept.

2281
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:51,680
Shall we eat?

2282
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,680
Alright, let's go eat!

2283
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:54,080
Yay!

2284
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,420
Oh my god, everybody's here!

2285
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,060
Oh my god, what is this?

2286
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,100
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2287
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,280
Hey!

2288
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,240
Hey brother!

2289
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,440
He's so much bigger than you!

2290
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,440
Who's the real beast?

2291
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,980
Who's the real beast?

2292
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,580
Who could it be?

2293
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:22,760
Who could it be?

2294
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,760
I want to do something special for Belle.

2295
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,480
I've never felt this way about anyone before.

2296
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,320
What are we doing here?

2297
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,180
What are we doing next here?

2298
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,280
Did we just talk to them?

2299
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,280
I think this game might have been a scam.

2300
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:41,980
Is that it?

2301
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:42,820
There has to be...

2302
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:43,660
Is that it?

2303
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,760
When do we kill the beast?

2304
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,580
That doesn't actually happen in the story.

2305
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,760
I want to kill the...

2306
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,480
Oh, there's the horse!

2307
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,980
Our horse went here.

2308
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:59,440
I want to know when we can kill the beast.

2309
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,140
Kill the beast!

2310
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:02,540
Kill the beast!

2311
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:08,560
Does the game part end when we get to the mini game?

2312
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:12,140
Yeah, I think there's like two dialogues and that's it.

2313
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,100
Oh my god, we'll never kill the beast.

2314
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:16,700
Where is the horse?

2315
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,320
Oh, he's in the library.

2316
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,640
He wants to get educated.

2317
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,280
He wants to get educated.

2318
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,160
Oh, hello.

2319
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,380
I got a book.

2320
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,040
Wait, there's more here?

2321
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:28,960
Where does this go?

2322
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,560
I want to find the beast's...

2323
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,360
The beast's room and then destroy his rose.

2324
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,540
Yeah, we got to destroy the rose.

2325
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:38,300
Destroy the... I found it!

2326
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:39,500
Wait, wait, wait!

2327
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:40,480
I want to see it!

2328
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,140
I found it.

2329
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,220
Is it up more?

2330
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:43,940
Yeah, it's up here.

2331
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,740
Watch, I'll do something crazy.

2332
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,660
No, I see you.

2333
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,760
Hold on.

2334
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:52,800
Oh, shit.

2335
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:53,920
Watch.

2336
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,000
Do you see this rose?

2337
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:56,980
Yeah.

2338
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:58,220
Wait.

2339
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:00,220
Oh.

2340
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,000
I can't destroy it.

2341
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,680
There's a watermelon under here!

2342
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,100
It's gone now.

2343
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,040
There's a watermelon under here!

2344
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,080
What?

2345
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,460
And thus the beast shall die.

2346
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,500
Why is there a melon?

2347
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:18,520
It's okay.

2348
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,600
It's like nothing.

2349
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,080
Oh my god, this place is full of cobwebs.

2350
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,720
I mean, it is old.

2351
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,440
Look, the rose is gone.

2352
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,240
I did it.

2353
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:29,500
Whoa.

2354
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,280
Yeah, you did it.

2355
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,000
I'm proud of you.

2356
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:32,880
We did it.

2357
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,540
We destroyed the beast's home.

2358
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,180
Land on that...

2359
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:37,160
Did you say hole?

2360
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:37,900
Home.

2361
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,920
And thus my job here...

2362
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,920
Wait, wait, wait, Min, look.

2363
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:43,100
Look at me.

2364
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,060
Where are you?

2365
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,980
My job here is done.

2366
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,240
I thought you were gonna jump off.

2367
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,520
Wait, I wonder...

2368
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:01,560
It's your brother.

2369
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,400
Wait, I'm gonna be a gargoyle?

2370
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:05,960
My job here is done.

2371
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,860
Do I look good?

2372
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:08,900
Oh my god.

2373
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:11,140
Oh yeah.

2374
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,400
Oh my god, you look just like him.

2375
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,900
Which one's the real gargoyle?

2376
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:16,400
Which one's the real gargoyle?

2377
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,780
Wait, there's a...

2378
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,760
There's a garden in the back.

2379
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:21,360
Wait, is there?

2380
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:22,980
You wanna be creative mode?

2381
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,000
Okay, okay, okay.

2382
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,480
Game mode, creative...

2383
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,260
Wait, what's your...

2384
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:31,700
What's your full name?

2385
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,420
MadeMintPhantom, I think.

2386
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:35,460
MadeMintPhantom, creative.

2387
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,980
Did you get it?

2388
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,040
Oh, I didn't, wait.

2389
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,180
How do I give you creative?

2390
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:42,200
Mint...

2391
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,600
Game mode...

2392
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:47,820
Creative...

2393
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:48,940
Made...

2394
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,160
Oh, here you go.

2395
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,320
Here you go.

2396
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:52,480
Yeah!

2397
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,660
Now we can zoom everywhere.

2398
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,220
What's this?

2399
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,360
I think it's a collectible.

2400
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:04,100
You know, silly Belle, leaving her stuff around as always.

2401
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,380
Yeah, I'm gonna destroy this castle.

2402
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:11,520
Kill the beast!

2403
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:12,960
Kill the beast!

2404
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,700
I know he's got treasure in the basement!

2405
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,140
He's gotta have treasure in the basement!

2406
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,140
Oh, the melons are back!

2407
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:23,340
Why is there melons in his home?

2408
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,560
Oh, it's like the tiles.

2409
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,360
It's the green tiles.

2410
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,340
They used melon for it.

2411
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:31,160
Oh...

2412
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,140
Alright, I'm going.

2413
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,140
Kill the beast!

2414
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,960
I'm going into the basement.

2415
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,420
Are we bad people?

2416
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,120
No...

2417
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,340
I'm trying to go...

2418
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,200
I'm trying to get into his home.

2419
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,040
Maybe they'll have like...

2420
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,120
Prisoners down there.

2421
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,220
I'm gonna kill Gaston.

2422
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,960
Just for the sake of it.

2423
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,880
Where are you, Gaston?

2424
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,380
I can't believe it, we don't actually get to kill the beast.

2425
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:13,420
What's the point?

2426
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:15,440
Come on, guys.

2427
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,500
Torch...

2428
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,080
There we go.

2429
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:24,660
We're more villainous than Disney villains.

2430
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:29,980
Oh my god.

2431
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,020
Oh my god, you're still down there?

2432
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,800
Where did you dig to?

2433
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,440
Where are you?

2434
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:42,140
Surely there's treasure down here.

2435
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:50,780
Oh my god.

2436
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,200
Into the void.

2437
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:54,900
Into the void.

2438
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,560
Here we go.

2439
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,100
Into the void.

2440
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,520
Into the unknown.

2441
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,360
Yeah, where's Frozen World?

2442
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:09,080
I found the basement.

2443
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,120
Nothing but the abyss.

2444
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:16,060
Into the unknown.

2445
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,600
That's where they send the prisoners.

2446
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,280
Right here, sir.

2447
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:21,600
This is where they...

2448
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,320
Oh my god, where am I?

2449
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,500
Oh, there I am.

2450
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,380
Can I save my horse now?

2451
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,740
I don't know where your horse is.

2452
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:34,520
He's down here.

2453
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,220
Oh, there he is.

2454
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,400
He's a bit further than before.

2455
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:42,600
I wonder what the collectible is here.

2456
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,160
Explore all areas.

2457
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,760
Let's find the hidden books.

2458
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,040
Oh, we got it.

2459
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:50,400
Oh yeah, we got most of everything.

2460
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:52,960
We basically finished this world.

2461
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,080
I'm going back to the hub.

2462
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,900
I'm just exploring a little bit.

2463
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,940
I don't think there's anywhere to explore.

2464
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:00,820
This is where like...

2465
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,500
This is the edge of the world.

2466
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,280
Who the hell is this farmer?

2467
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,260
I'm gonna burn the village.

2468
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:09,840
Burn Gaston.

2469
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,100
I'm coming back.

2470
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,000
Lumiere.

2471
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,460
I'm Alter Lumiere.

2472
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,340
I'm here to burn the village.

2473
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,960
You try to kill the beast, I'll kill the world.

2474
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,120
Hold on.

2475
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:26,000
I can send him.

2476
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:26,520
Please.

2477
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:28,500
Oh shit.

2478
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,060
I know how to kill Gaston.

2479
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,260
Wait, what?

2480
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:34,200
Wait, what?

2481
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,280
What are you doing?

2482
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:37,860
Wait, wait, wait.

2483
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:45,620
Wait, he has a task for us.

2484
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,100
Why does he have an excavation point?

2485
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:49,400
No, he doesn't.

2486
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,020
It was just going to the beast.

2487
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:52,880
Okay, it's time.

2488
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,520
We know how to kill Gaston.

2489
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,040
Let's go.

2490
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:57,000
Wait, I can't see anything.

2491
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:05,380
We know what to do now.

2492
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,960
We know what to do now.

2493
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,320
I'll go down first.

2494
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,860
And then, I believe you're here.

2495
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,800
And I'll dig up with you.

2496
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:19,860
Okay.

2497
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:20,960
Oh shit.

2498
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:23,700
Goodbye, Gaston.

2499
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,420
Goodbye, Gaston.

2500
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,280
Goodbye, Gaston.

2501
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:28,860
Don't worry.

2502
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:31,460
He's so dreamy, Gaston.

2503
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,000
Rest in peace.

2504
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:37,480
I went down your hole.

2505
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,740
I chose the wrong hole.

2506
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,280
Goodbye, Gaston.

2507
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,000
There he goes.

2508
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,460
Goodbye, Gaston.

2509
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,500
We could send the whole village down there.

2510
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:01,900
We kidnapped all the villagers.

2511
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,460
And just put them into the void.

2512
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07,020
What are you doing?

2513
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:07,620
Can you do this?

2514
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:07,880
Wait.

2515
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:08,700
What are you doing?

2516
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:10,940
Can we TP all?

2517
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,080
TP all?

2518
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:14,500
TP all NPCs?

2519
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:16,740
Is that TP...

2520
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:22,820
So cute.

2521
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,180
This is where he went.

2522
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:26,800
TP...

2523
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:29,620
TP...

2524
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,280
Uh...

2525
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:33,200
TP... Oh my God.

2526
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:35,020
I know there's one where you can actually...

2527
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:36,920
At all entities.

2528
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,360
Oh my God!

2529
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,720
You're gonna break the game real.

2530
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:51,880
Oh my God!

2531
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:53,720
Did I do it?

2532
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,320
Did I break the game?

2533
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:00,520
Wait, where are we?

2534
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,260
Where are you?

2535
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:05,080
Did I break the game?

2536
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,780
I think I broke the game.

2537
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:11,890
I did it!

2538
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:12,770
I did it!

2539
01:40:12,770 --> 01:40:13,210
I

2540
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:18,640
did it!

2541
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:20,380
Dude,

2542
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:30,920
where are you?

2543
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,260
I see you.

2544
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:38,900
What happened?

2545
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,460
How did we get here?

2546
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,500
What happened?

2547
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,260
I snapped the story...

2548
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:46,440
I snapped the story and...

2549
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,260
The beast is no more.

2550
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:52,900
The beast is no more.

2551
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:54,460
What is that?

2552
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:57,480
Let me change my clothes to fit the setting.

2553
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,080
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2554
01:40:58,460 --> 01:40:59,280
Don't look.

2555
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,880
I'm dressing for the occasion.

2556
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,180
Me too.

2557
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,360
Which one are you gonna be?

2558
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,280
Don't wear my same outfit, okay?

2559
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:12,260
Okay.

2560
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,280
Okay.

2561
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,640
Alright, I'm turning around.

2562
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:17,340
Where are you?

2563
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:41,920
Alright,

2564
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,380
let's go commit some wishes.

2565
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:52,460
Why is this world's volume so much louder?

2566
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:55,520
Wait, we can go get all the treasure!

2567
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:56,580
Oh true!

2568
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:57,720
Oh my god!

2569
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:58,680
Let's free ourselves!

2570
01:41:58,840 --> 01:41:59,700
We don't need Aladdin!

2571
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,540
We don't need Aladdin!

2572
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,640
We don't need Aladdin!

2573
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,220
We can free ourselves!

2574
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:08,880
Alright, let's go.

2575
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:10,780
We have what we call...

2576
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:11,860
Creative mode.

2577
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:14,260
Woah!

2578
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:15,640
We're rich!

2579
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:19,270
We're rich!

2580
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:20,530
Oh my god!

2581
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:22,430
Abu, don't touch it!

2582
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,430
Don't touch the stuff.

2583
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:24,810
Don't touch it, Abu.

2584
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:27,050
Oh my god.

2585
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:29,130
We can be Aladdin.

2586
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:36,130
And then I'll break this.

2587
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:37,390
Yeah, break that.

2588
01:42:37,710 --> 01:42:39,250
You can't break it.

2589
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:41,250
We can send it to the unknown.

2590
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:43,650
Into the unknown!

2591
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:45,450
Into the unknown!

2592
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:47,370
Can your friend do this?

2593
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:48,370
Bomb, bomb.

2594
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:51,170
Can your friend do that?

2595
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:54,850
Can your friend do this?

2596
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:57,370
That's the thing they had!

2597
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:02,810
Why can't we go into the hole?

2598
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:05,410
There we go.

2599
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:07,070
Alright, here we go!

2600
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:09,890
Into the unknown!

2601
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:14,770
Oh my god, how fast have you dug already?

2602
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:16,610
We're free!

2603
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:18,130
We're free!

2604
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:21,650
We don't need Aladdin!

2605
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:23,890
Aladdin will never get this now.

2606
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:26,250
That's right.

2607
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:28,030
We're not chained to nobody.

2608
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:29,910
We're free genies now.

2609
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:32,530
We're free genies.

2610
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:38,070
We're so stupid.

2611
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:38,930
I know.

2612
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:40,530
I'm breaking out of here.

2613
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:41,790
I'm digging up.

2614
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:43,490
We're digging up!

2615
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,510
Okay, that's better.

2616
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:50,010
I'm not gonna be trapped here.

2617
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,590
I'm outside of bounds.

2618
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:56,230
Wait, don't dig up.

2619
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:58,850
Wait, I'm right here.

2620
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:00,290
Wait, there's an invisible wall.

2621
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:01,990
There's an invisible wall!

2622
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:03,950
Can we break it?

2623
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:06,690
Oh, I broke it.

2624
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:07,670
That's right.

2625
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:11,150
Nothing can block us.

2626
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:13,710
We're invincible now!

2627
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:15,710
We're all powerful genies!

2628
01:44:22,030 --> 01:44:23,210
Where's the sultan?

2629
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:24,230
I'm gonna kidnap the sultan.

2630
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:30,670
Give us the throne!

2631
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:34,050
Or we'll send you to the void.

2632
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:35,650
Oh, he's crying.

2633
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:37,270
He's crying.

2634
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:38,550
He is?

2635
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:40,650
He's gonna do like a thing.

2636
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:42,630
Look, look, look.

2637
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,610
He's like, that's right, be afraid.

2638
01:44:47,470 --> 01:44:48,690
Wait, what if I do this?

2639
01:44:49,170 --> 01:44:49,990
Watch this.

2640
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:53,750
Give us the throne or I'm gonna shoot.

2641
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:58,210
I can't...

2642
01:44:58,810 --> 01:44:59,690
That's right.

2643
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:02,570
Give us the throne or I'll shoot.

2644
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:07,870
What?

2645
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:12,350
Alright, sultan.

2646
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,330
What are you doing?

2647
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:18,670
What are you doing?

2648
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:22,990
I'm poisoning him.

2649
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,190
Oh my God.

2650
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:28,650
I'm poisoning the throne.

2651
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,150
Wait, go out of creative.

2652
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,170
Okay, okay.

2653
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:32,790
See if it works.

2654
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:34,870
Game mode adventure.

2655
01:45:35,650 --> 01:45:36,210
Okay.

2656
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:38,990
I'm okay.

2657
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:41,030
Oh, it doesn't work?

2658
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:41,410
No.

2659
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:42,950
What the hell?

2660
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:44,330
No, he didn't poison me.

2661
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:45,210
No!

2662
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:47,630
I've been lied to.

2663
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:51,050
Oh, you know, it's like, one thing I'm...

2664
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:51,650
Wait, what was it?

2665
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:54,650
One thing I pride myself on, I'm an excellent judge of character.

2666
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:57,270
Somebody said?

2667
01:45:57,730 --> 01:45:58,290
Yeah.

2668
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:00,610
That's right.

2669
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:01,570
There's nothing inside.

2670
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:04,410
Where did you go?

2671
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:05,390
I don't know.

2672
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:07,350
I'm looking for Jafar.

2673
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:10,930
I wonder if the cast...

2674
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:11,290
Stop!

2675
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:13,890
What is the tiger's name?

2676
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:15,690
Oh, I forgot.

2677
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,530
Wait, where did you go?

2678
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:19,190
I'm outside.

2679
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:21,210
Are you with Jasmine?

2680
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:23,870
No, I think she's at the beginning.

2681
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:25,110
No, she's right here.

2682
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:26,210
Oh, where?

2683
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:29,050
Oh, wait, there's a magic carpet.

2684
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:32,010
I'm at the...

2685
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:32,730
No, no, no.

2686
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:34,130
I'm right here.

2687
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:35,810
Where's the tiger?

2688
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:37,090
Over here.

2689
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:38,430
Someone says Raja.

2690
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:41,650
Oh, there he is!

2691
01:46:41,970 --> 01:46:42,630
There he is!

2692
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,110
Oh my God, he's so cute!

2693
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:49,310
Hello, Raja.

2694
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,130
Alright, show me Jasmine.

2695
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:54,390
Okay, she's like...

2696
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:55,390
Call me Gelatin.

2697
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,890
Have you ever seen that song?

2698
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:04,010
That's Aladdin and Jasmine.

2699
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:07,170
Let me break this invisible wall.

2700
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:09,570
Wait, how do we...

2701
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,770
Why is there an invisible wall?

2702
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:12,870
I guess we're not allowed to fly.

2703
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:14,270
Wait, how do we access this?

2704
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:17,710
I think we have to talk to Jasmine back there to access this.

2705
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,070
Let me talk to her.

2706
01:47:20,450 --> 01:47:21,310
Alright, Jasmine.

2707
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:24,230
We need you to head over there so we can activate your game.

2708
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:27,450
Okay, game mode.

2709
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:28,290
Adventure.

2710
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,690
Where's Aladdin?

2711
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:32,870
Welcome to Agrabah, my name's Jasmine.

2712
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:34,870
You haven't seen my name, Aladdin, right?

2713
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:38,090
The magic carpet droops down sadly.

2714
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:43,150
Alright, let's go.

2715
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,930
Oh, I see her, I see her.

2716
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:45,570
She's already here.

2717
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:46,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2718
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:47,930
A whole new world!

2719
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:50,650
I'm gonna stay in adventure.

2720
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:52,970
Alright, activate the game.

2721
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:56,890
Where's Aladdin?

2722
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:58,630
Oh, that does...

2723
01:47:58,630 --> 01:48:01,150
That guy is blonde with blue eyes.

2724
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:02,570
I don't think he belongs here.

2725
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:06,750
Are you lost, buddy?

2726
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:10,450
Alright, I'm talking to Jasmine.

2727
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,950
Okay.

2728
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:13,790
Alright, hey you scoundrel.

2729
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:14,730
Did you just steal that apple?

2730
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:16,390
Of course not, we're only talking.

2731
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:19,310
The scoundrel probably ate it, no one steals from my car.

2732
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:20,010
Thief!

2733
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:21,350
Alright.

2734
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:28,070
Ride on the magic carpet to escape from the angry shopkeepers.

2735
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:30,910
You will need to steer in the right direction.

2736
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:32,710
Wait, are we both on the magic carpet?

2737
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:35,190
No, I just...

2738
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:37,150
Wait, I think it's a one-person game.

2739
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:38,390
Wait, is this a one-person?

2740
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:39,750
It doesn't reach the end to win?

2741
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:40,910
Wait, are you racing?

2742
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:42,970
You see this instruction?

2743
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,430
I only...

2744
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:48,610
I had to, like, zoom through the text.

2745
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:50,750
Oh, no, I think...

2746
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:52,050
Wait, I'm stuck in the loading screen.

2747
01:48:52,570 --> 01:48:53,330
Yeah, me too.

2748
01:48:56,090 --> 01:48:57,810
I think we broke the game.

2749
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:12,850
Is our Disney tour over?

2750
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:17,350
Because we didn't properly load into this world.

2751
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,180
We deleted the piece.

2752
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,740
We deleted the castle.

2753
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,500
What do we do?

2754
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:37,820
I want to ride the magic carpet.

2755
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:41,020
No, I want it to be a whole new world.

2756
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,820
Here, let's quit.

2757
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:43,460
I'm going to quit.

2758
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,060
And I'm going to join again.

2759
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,120
Yeah, me too, me too.

2760
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,460
We just want to go to a whole new world.

2761
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:51,080
I want to ride the magic carpet.

2762
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:53,060
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

2763
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:54,780
Wait, what's happening?

2764
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:56,200
I got the obstacle.

2765
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,240
I'm back here.

2766
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,840
Wait, okay, I'm in game mode.

2767
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,060
Maybe we have to be on adventure, both of us.

2768
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:05,960
I'll give it to you.

2769
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:06,820
Oh, wait, there's Abu.

2770
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,700
Are you in the mini game?

2771
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,800
No, no, no, no.

2772
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:11,780
I'm in.

2773
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,860
Wait, are you in the lobby?

2774
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,200
I just discovered a secret room.

2775
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,120
Oh, wait, where are you?

2776
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,120
Oh, you just trapped me!

2777
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:27,310
I was like,

2778
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:34,290
far beneath the ground.

2779
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:38,050
Okay, okay, I'm good, I'm good.

2780
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:39,190
Okay, where are you?

2781
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:40,990
Is that you?

2782
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:43,770
Are you holding a book?

2783
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:45,030
Yeah, I'm holding a book, where did you go?

2784
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:46,670
You're invisible to me!

2785
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:49,150
Oh,

2786
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,900
a magic trick.

2787
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:57,080
Look at this magic.

2788
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,400
Wait, can you go into spectator mode?

2789
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,660
Can you put us both in spectator?

2790
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:03,520
Okay, okay, okay.

2791
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,680
I need to show you.

2792
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,720
I need to show you.

2793
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:08,900
Okay, okay.

2794
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:10,900
Okay, okay.

2795
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,100
Why are we invisible?

2796
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,860
It's like a magic trick.

2797
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:18,560
Okay, now go below.

2798
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,560
And then you see the two hidden rooms.

2799
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:24,240
What is this doing here?

2800
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:27,100
Why is there a random fucking room?

2801
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:30,540
Why did you trap me?

2802
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,740
Why did you trap me?

2803
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:35,120
It was literally my grave.

2804
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,500
What the fuck?

2805
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:41,280
Good.

2806
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:44,380
Wait, I see the blonde man!

2807
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,540
Where is he?

2808
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:48,420
I don't think the game is any better.

2809
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:49,820
I think it's still messed up.

2810
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:55,220
I think we messed up.

2811
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:57,580
Put us back to adventure.

2812
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:59,460
And then we'll...

2813
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:00,860
Put us back to adventure.

2814
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:02,760
And we can just take us back to the hub.

2815
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:03,320
Okay, okay.

2816
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:05,760
Adventure.

2817
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,100
Okay, and then...

2818
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,180
I don't know what happened to him.

2819
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:12,420
He just disappeared.

2820
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,360
Disappeared.

2821
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,800
Where did you go?

2822
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:18,140
Are you going back to the hub?

2823
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:19,940
Yeah, I want to go back to the hub.

2824
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,320
We're stuck in the game.

2825
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:31,960
I'm starting the game.

2826
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:33,420
Wait, how do you start the game?

2827
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:35,040
We broke the game.

2828
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,020
We actually broke the game.

2829
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,500
We're never supposed to be here.

2830
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:42,260
We actually broke the game.

2831
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:42,940
Wait, is that you?

2832
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:46,100
Did you see a flybook?

2833
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:49,200
I see a magical path.

2834
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:50,420
We broke the game.

2835
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:53,540
We were supposed to ride on the magic carpet.

2836
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,140
They didn't give us a magic carpet.

2837
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,040
I've been slowed.

2838
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,440
I've been slowed.

2839
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:03,460
What do you mean you've been slowed?

2840
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:05,500
Apparently, if you hit a wall, you get slowed.

2841
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,180
How did you get a magic carpet?

2842
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:08,740
I don't know.

2843
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:09,780
I'm running the course.

2844
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:14,740
No!

2845
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:16,660
Wait, what's happening?

2846
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,040
I can't move.

2847
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,480
We're starting the race!

2848
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:27,020
Guards arrived?

2849
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:27,800
What does that mean?

2850
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,340
I don't know.

2851
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:34,660
Are we on a carpet?

2852
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,620
I think we're just running.

2853
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:39,880
I think we're just running.

2854
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:44,770
I'm just running.

2855
01:54:04,830 --> 01:54:06,270
Be careful.

2856
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:08,110
I made it.

2857
01:54:09,270 --> 01:54:12,510
I ran through the one hole I dug.

2858
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:16,630
I ran through the one hole I dug in the invisible wall.

2859
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:22,290
That's why they lost the theory.

2860
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:25,730
No, that's not what happened.

2861
01:54:25,890 --> 01:54:26,410
Why?

2862
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:30,370
It's not fair.

2863
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,410
Wait, if I right click the carpet, I can have the carpet?

2864
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:35,930
Wait, are you on the carpet?

2865
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:41,690
I had to right click the carpet?

2866
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:48,650
I was just walking.

2867
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:54,570
I'm doing this again.

2868
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:57,650
I'm doing this again.

2869
01:54:57,650 --> 01:55:03,850
I literally watched you drop the carpet and keep going.

2870
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:09,770
What?

2871
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:11,330
I'm on a carpet now.

2872
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:13,050
I dropped it.

2873
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:25,210
Why is it so slow?

2874
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:28,010
It's so slow!

2875
01:55:29,450 --> 01:55:32,130
I don't think you can touch anything with it.

2876
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:35,030
Or rather, you can't press space or...

2877
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:37,150
Bro, why am I so slow?

2878
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:41,550
Oh god, I'm crying.

2879
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:44,930
I can't see the tracks between my tears.

2880
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:50,730
I don't know.

2881
01:55:54,970 --> 01:55:57,710
I'm so confused.

2882
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:00,710
Why am I walking?

2883
01:56:03,970 --> 01:56:05,370
Oh my god!

2884
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:09,830
Oh my god, we did it.

2885
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:16,870
We're so good at this game.

2886
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,570
Oh my god.

2887
01:56:20,230 --> 01:56:21,370
We can talk to the carpet.

2888
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:22,770
Yeah, he just restarts the world.

2889
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:23,070
Why?

2890
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:25,150
Where's Aladdin in all of this?

2891
01:56:25,490 --> 01:56:25,930
I don't know.

2892
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:26,810
We saw his monkey.

2893
01:56:26,990 --> 01:56:27,490
We saw Abu.

2894
01:56:27,490 --> 01:56:28,750
We saw Abu.

2895
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:36,550
We saw... We didn't see Jafar though, but where the fuck is... Where the fuck... In Agrabah, there's no Aladdin?

2896
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:41,770
Oh my god.

2897
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:44,210
What the fuck?

2898
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:45,210
Where are we?

2899
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:47,390
We're on the racetrack.

2900
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:49,110
Wow.

2901
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:11,070
I think we actually destroyed... Wait, I'm gonna check if Belle's world is still back.

2902
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:12,390
I'm TP-ing back.

2903
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:13,010
I need to know.

2904
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:13,310
Okay.

2905
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:15,410
Oh, I broke all the portals.

2906
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:18,030
Wait, what do you mean you broke all the portals?

2907
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:20,790
Wait, wait, come back.

2908
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:22,430
None of the portals.

2909
01:57:39,190 --> 01:57:40,750
Teleport to one of the mini-games.

2910
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:45,010
Let's go to... Let's go to Maze Chase.

2911
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:45,930
They kicked us out.

2912
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:47,570
I think they closed the portals.

2913
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,650
They can't stop us.

2914
01:57:52,250 --> 01:57:54,150
They can't stop us.

2915
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:56,530
It's time to change clothes.

2916
01:57:57,990 --> 01:58:01,470
They thought closing the portals will stop us.

2917
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:10,950
They really think you can't stop us from coming here.

2918
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:15,970
We'll always find a way.

2919
01:58:15,970 --> 01:58:17,370
Why did you die?

2920
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:23,050
Yeah, you fucked it in two hours, but Organization 13 couldn't do.

2921
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:31,070
Just get us in.

2922
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,250
Kingdom Hearts will finish.

2923
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:34,470
We don't even have Kingdom Hearts 4.

2924
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:36,310
The game will finish in Kingdom Hearts 1.

2925
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:37,910
We will kill Sora.

2926
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:40,490
Where are you?

2927
01:58:40,670 --> 01:58:41,790
I'm right behind you.

2928
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:43,390
You're invisible to me.

2929
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:45,050
No, you're not invisible.

2930
01:58:45,170 --> 01:58:47,390
Wait, maybe if I change skins...

2931
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:49,510
Do you see Sans?

2932
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:50,370
I just hit you.

2933
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:51,430
Oh, yeah, I see you.

2934
01:58:52,190 --> 01:58:52,630
Alright,

2935
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:56,050
hello.

2936
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,430
Alright, let's go talk to Alice.

2937
01:58:59,930 --> 01:59:00,290
Wait, Autobot.

2938
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:00,830
Autobot.

2939
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:01,810
Wait, Autobot, you're right.

2940
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:04,690
Alright, do you like my bow?

2941
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:06,710
Yeah.

2942
01:59:07,090 --> 01:59:08,710
To a shark cat with a gun.

2943
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:18,930
This feels on brand for the Mad Hatter.

2944
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:19,710
Yeah, it does.

2945
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:24,030
A very unbirthday to you.

2946
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:24,470
To you.

2947
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:31,090
So, when I was in grade school, no, middle school...

2948
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,190
Also, why is the music in here so intense?

2949
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:39,390
But when I was in middle school, I wanted to be the Mad Hatter for my school's Halloween.

2950
01:59:40,330 --> 01:59:40,670
Yeah.

2951
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:42,330
And why'd you leave?

2952
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:43,630
Oh, wait, I tabbed out.

2953
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:52,030
And so, my mom got me a costume, but it was one of those sexy costumes that said like...

2954
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:52,790
Oh, my God.

2955
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:55,450
His hat said 69 over 420.

2956
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:56,810
Oh, my God.

2957
01:59:58,370 --> 02:00:00,090
Am I a shark cat or am I Steve?

2958
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:01,250
You're Steve.

2959
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:04,070
Okay, I gotta re-wear my clothes again.

2960
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:11,230
I didn't know what it meant until my mom, or not my mom, my teacher told me what it meant.

2961
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:16,850
Wait, if it's a sexy costume, then wouldn't it be sexy?

2962
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:22,750
I wore a tank top and stuff underneath it, so nothing would show.

2963
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:26,090
Alright, ever since I arrived... Okay, you can be Alice.

2964
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:28,450
Hello, I'm Alice.

2965
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:31,170
I do hope you're someone who is sensical.

2966
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:34,270
Ever since I arrived here, so much has been nonsense.

2967
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:39,990
Oh, but you do seem as though you are what you are rather than being not what you are not.

2968
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:41,870
Perhaps you might help me.

2969
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:45,110
I fear I may have angered the queen.

2970
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:50,150
You see, she sent her playing card guards... Oh, my gosh.

2971
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:52,330
That is so hard to say, playing card guards.

2972
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:55,590
...to chase me through this maze.

2973
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:57,870
Would you help me find a way out?

2974
02:00:58,170 --> 02:00:59,390
Oh, thank you.

2975
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:01,170
Quick, we must find an exit.

2976
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:03,570
Alright, what do we do?

2977
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:05,050
Okay, collect paint.

2978
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:07,590
Wait, the leaves are disappearing.

2979
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:11,250
Yeah, I know the leaves... Wait, how are we gonna do the maze if the leaves are disappearing?

2980
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:14,170
Wait, paint the roses to unlock the path.

2981
02:01:14,730 --> 02:01:16,590
Avoid the card soldiers, okay?

2982
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:17,130
Okay.

2983
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:18,130
Wait, this is scary.

2984
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:19,270
Yeah, this is scary.

2985
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:20,730
What if they jump scare us?

2986
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:23,430
Get to the end to win... Why are the leaves disappearing?

2987
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:26,070
Did somebody paint the roses already?

2988
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:30,610
Let me make sure...

2989
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:31,770
Wait, oh, we're competing!

2990
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:37,730
SimWonderland...

2991
02:01:37,730 --> 02:01:38,810
Wait, oh, did I not get the paint?

2992
02:01:38,910 --> 02:01:40,110
Oh, you have to right-click the paint.

2993
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:45,690
Someone was listening, dude.

2994
02:01:51,330 --> 02:01:53,150
You just have to... Oh, my God, they're coming.

2995
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:57,670
We're not competing.

2996
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:58,990
Yes, we are.

2997
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:02,430
We have the same score.

2998
02:02:02,970 --> 02:02:04,870
Because we haven't found the exit yet.

2999
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:07,370
Wait, where am I?

3000
02:02:08,610 --> 02:02:09,790
Where am I?

3001
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:11,570
I know where you are, Sonic.

3002
02:02:11,970 --> 02:02:13,970
Wait, where did I go?

3003
02:02:17,550 --> 02:02:19,970
Do you just paint any rose?

3004
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:20,530
I'm so confused.

3005
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:21,230
I guess so.

3006
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:22,550
This is kind of weird.

3007
02:02:22,850 --> 02:02:23,950
I don't know where I am.

3008
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:26,210
There's no more paint!

3009
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:31,890
They're only chasing after me!

3010
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:33,370
This is messed up.

3011
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:36,070
I beat the game.

3012
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:38,990
Wait, what?

3013
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:41,810
Where are you?

3014
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:45,150
Oh, there's more paint.

3015
02:02:45,370 --> 02:02:46,330
Where did I go?

3016
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:47,890
Oh, no!

3017
02:02:53,890 --> 02:02:55,770
I broke the game.

3018
02:02:58,410 --> 02:02:59,530
You did it.

3019
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:01,970
I made it out!

3020
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:03,890
I actually...

3021
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:04,610
Wait, no, no.

3022
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:06,170
I'll give you a creative move.

3023
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:07,410
I'll show you where I went.

3024
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:08,810
Okay, okay, okay.

3025
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:11,350
I was like, how did I get here?

3026
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:14,530
I actually...

3027
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:17,950
I actually won the game.

3028
02:03:18,270 --> 02:03:19,090
Okay, come here.

3029
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:19,670
Follow me.

3030
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:20,690
Follow me.

3031
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:22,390
I'm breaking this wall.

3032
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,450
Oh yeah, break it, break it.

3033
02:03:24,930 --> 02:03:25,590
Break the wall.

3034
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:26,530
Okay, okay, watch.

3035
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:27,810
Okay, so...

3036
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:28,450
I...

3037
02:03:29,370 --> 02:03:31,010
I ran this way.

3038
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:33,370
So, obviously, we have to go here, right?

3039
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:34,590
This is where we have to go.

3040
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:36,490
But, like, I went...

3041
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:37,030
Watch, follow me.

3042
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:38,390
I went this way.

3043
02:03:38,730 --> 02:03:41,410
And then there was a hole right here.

3044
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:42,370
And...

3045
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:44,310
You went through here.

3046
02:03:44,610 --> 02:03:46,090
And then I was like...

3047
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:49,170
And then I went all the way...

3048
02:03:49,170 --> 02:03:49,850
Follow me.

3049
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:52,010
I went all the way...

3050
02:03:54,630 --> 02:03:56,010
I was like...

3051
02:03:56,010 --> 02:03:56,990
Wait...

3052
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:01,890
I was like...

3053
02:04:01,890 --> 02:04:02,910
I did it.

3054
02:04:03,070 --> 02:04:04,670
And I was like, wait, this is a secret.

3055
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:06,150
I don't think...

3056
02:04:06,930 --> 02:04:08,990
Why would they even let you in here?

3057
02:04:09,330 --> 02:04:09,750
I don't know.

3058
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:13,410
I clearly was, like, running through this black maze.

3059
02:04:13,590 --> 02:04:15,450
And I was like, oh my god, I did it.

3060
02:04:17,890 --> 02:04:18,810
I was like...

3061
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:21,310
Why did it go black?

3062
02:04:21,390 --> 02:04:22,910
I was so confused.

3063
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:24,590
Let me in.

3064
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:28,730
I was so confused.

3065
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:30,450
I didn't realize...

3066
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:33,430
I was not even in the game anymore.

3067
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:39,010
Why is it so intense?

3068
02:04:41,570 --> 02:04:43,670
She's like, off with their heads.

3069
02:04:44,450 --> 02:04:46,530
Wait, the flower area is so cute.

3070
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:48,330
Oh, yeah, it is.

3071
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:50,470
Oh, you can talk to the flowers.

3072
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:54,870
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers.

3073
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:58,490
Oh, especially in the month of June.

3074
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:06,730
Afternoon.

3075
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:09,210
Where are you?

3076
02:05:09,290 --> 02:05:10,610
We're like, I'm in the garden.

3077
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:12,370
I'm trapped, okay.

3078
02:05:12,650 --> 02:05:13,410
Wait, where are the flowers?

3079
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:14,450
I wanna talk to the flowers.

3080
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:16,270
I wanna see what they look like.

3081
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:17,490
Oh, there they are.

3082
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,690
Yeah, yeah, they're cute.

3083
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,810
Oh, there they are.

3084
02:05:21,070 --> 02:05:21,770
Look at them.

3085
02:05:22,730 --> 02:05:23,610
What else is there?

3086
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:25,150
Oh, where's the Mad Hatter place?

3087
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:25,850
Oh, you're right.

3088
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:28,230
Where is...

3089
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:28,810
Oh, there's Alice.

3090
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:30,010
Alice.

3091
02:05:30,850 --> 02:05:32,130
Did I find them?

3092
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,350
I found...

3093
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:34,810
Oh, I found it, I found it, I found it!

3094
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:38,390
It's a tea party.

3095
02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:39,690
It's next to the gardens.

3096
02:05:40,750 --> 02:05:41,370
The garden?

3097
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:42,630
What the hell is the gardens?

3098
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:44,190
It's next to the flowers.

3099
02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:45,750
Come, look up, look up.

3100
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:46,730
Up?

3101
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:47,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3102
02:05:48,030 --> 02:05:49,250
Come here, look at me, look at me, look at me.

3103
02:05:50,530 --> 02:05:52,670
A very warm birthday to you.

3104
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:54,470
To you, to you, to you, to you.

3105
02:05:54,590 --> 02:05:56,650
A very warm birthday to you.

3106
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:58,450
To you, to you, to you, to you.

3107
02:05:58,530 --> 02:05:59,430
Okay, I need to talk.

3108
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:00,690
I wanna know what you're gonna say.

3109
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:04,330
Oh, shit.

3110
02:06:05,110 --> 02:06:05,750
Sorry.

3111
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:07,850
What did you do?

3112
02:06:09,410 --> 02:06:10,670
A table!

3113
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:13,990
You ruined their birthday party!

3114
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:15,930
I

3115
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:23,030
think the whole table was left.

3116
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:23,390
Oh my god!

3117
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:25,630
You ruined their birthday!

3118
02:06:25,630 --> 02:06:27,090
I ruined their party!

3119
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:28,850
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

3120
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:33,070
Over on his table, it's fine.

3121
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:34,270
It's fine.

3122
02:06:34,590 --> 02:06:35,850
You ruined their birthday!

3123
02:06:36,670 --> 02:06:38,170
Oh, what a delightful child.

3124
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:38,930
I'm so excited.

3125
02:06:39,250 --> 02:06:40,470
You must have a cup of tea.

3126
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:40,990
There we go.

3127
02:06:41,490 --> 02:06:42,270
Clean cup, clean cup.

3128
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:43,370
Move down, move down.

3129
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:45,650
Move down, move down.

3130
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:48,330
Oh my god, that poor Dormouse.

3131
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:49,650
That poor Dormouse.

3132
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:50,650
Where's the Dormouse?

3133
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:53,810
Oh my god, I didn't even see him in there.

3134
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:55,630
You ruined their birthday!

3135
02:06:56,570 --> 02:06:57,770
It's his grave now.

3136
02:07:01,010 --> 02:07:02,230
This is where he dies.

3137
02:07:02,230 --> 02:07:02,970
You don't even see him anymore.

3138
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:06,190
Goodbye, Dormouse.

3139
02:07:07,190 --> 02:07:08,610
Goodbye, we're sorry.

3140
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:10,030
We're sorry, Menace.

3141
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:14,430
This is why they closed the borders on us.

3142
02:07:14,710 --> 02:07:16,090
They can't control my strength.

3143
02:07:17,110 --> 02:07:20,030
This is why they closed the borders.

3144
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:22,750
They didn't want us to come back.

3145
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:26,310
The other world heard about us.

3146
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:28,410
Oh, there's... what's his name?

3147
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:30,530
Yeah, with the seashell people.

3148
02:07:30,530 --> 02:07:31,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3149
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:33,850
Where are the little children that he enslaved?

3150
02:07:35,070 --> 02:07:35,570
Okay.

3151
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:38,310
Oh, look.

3152
02:07:39,410 --> 02:07:41,350
Oh, there's the... wait, there's the door.

3153
02:07:41,730 --> 02:07:42,430
Wait, is this the door?

3154
02:07:43,310 --> 02:07:43,750
What door?

3155
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:45,950
This is where... oh, I'm late, I'm late!

3156
02:07:46,230 --> 02:07:47,990
I'm so late!

3157
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:49,670
Oh my god, I broke the door.

3158
02:07:51,710 --> 02:07:52,750
Where are you?

3159
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:54,090
Wait, wait, wait, where are you?

3160
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:56,270
I'm still by the tea house.

3161
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:57,790
Float up, float up.

3162
02:07:58,490 --> 02:07:59,250
Floating up.

3163
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:01,630
Float up.

3164
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:02,810
And then you'll...

3165
02:08:03,990 --> 02:08:05,830
Go to the green forest.

3166
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:09,350
Wait, where are you?

3167
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:11,150
Green forest.

3168
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:11,770
Oh, there you are.

3169
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:12,910
Oh, I see you, I see you.

3170
02:08:13,090 --> 02:08:13,850
Right here.

3171
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:18,010
Come here.

3172
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:18,790
There's a rabbit.

3173
02:08:19,410 --> 02:08:20,710
Oh, he's late for bed, poor thing!

3174
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:23,790
So this was originally like...

3175
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:27,090
All blocked up and I just fucking destroyed it.

3176
02:08:29,130 --> 02:08:30,550
I was like...

3177
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:32,430
It's my world now.

3178
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:34,590
Oh, we can float and everything!

3179
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:36,650
I think that's how you start the world.

3180
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,210
Until we broke it.

3181
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:39,870
Yeah, I think we fall down here.

3182
02:08:40,050 --> 02:08:41,650
And then we're gonna be like...

3183
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:45,050
Before they closed the borders, we were supposed to...

3184
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:50,430
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3185
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:51,370
That's right.

3186
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:54,310
We're here to invade your land.

3187
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:57,650
They're like, oh god, don't get mental.

3188
02:08:58,390 --> 02:09:00,310
Shut it out, shut everything down!

3189
02:09:00,310 --> 02:09:05,390
I heard they snatched the beast world out of existence.

3190
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:10,790
Wait, if you go back to the beast world, is there anything?

3191
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:12,210
How do we...

3192
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:14,030
Let's try magic wand.

3193
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:16,350
I think I need to be in an adventure mode.

3194
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:16,590
Castle kitchen.

3195
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:20,090
Does it still exist?

3196
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:22,590
What is meadow for?

3197
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:23,490
Wait, uh...

3198
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:25,530
Everybody's gone though.

3199
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:26,410
There's no people.

3200
02:09:26,770 --> 02:09:27,530
There's no people.

3201
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:32,130
Wait, they might be in the void.

3202
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:33,390
They might be in the void.

3203
02:09:33,490 --> 02:09:34,230
I'm gonna go down.

3204
02:09:34,530 --> 02:09:35,570
I'm gonna go down.

3205
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:37,250
They might be in the void.

3206
02:09:39,150 --> 02:09:41,910
Wait, they're not.

3207
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:42,690
They're all dead.

3208
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:44,170
I think they're all dead.

3209
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:44,970
I think they're all dead.

3210
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:47,470
I think we killed them all.

3211
02:09:48,370 --> 02:09:48,730
No.

3212
02:09:49,150 --> 02:09:49,550
No.

3213
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:52,330
I think we killed them all.

3214
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:52,810
No.

3215
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:53,630
Oh my god.

3216
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:54,610
Go to the village.

3217
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:58,710
There's not even the gargoyles left.

3218
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:03,210
Wait.

3219
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:06,630
Now I know why they closed the borders.

3220
02:10:07,310 --> 02:10:08,330
Now I know.

3221
02:10:08,730 --> 02:10:09,370
There's no one.

3222
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:10,570
No one at all.

3223
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:10,810
Where's the beast?

3224
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:11,970
Oh my god.

3225
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:12,550
Nobody's here.

3226
02:10:13,130 --> 02:10:14,510
Nothing is here.

3227
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:15,670
Nothing.

3228
02:10:16,010 --> 02:10:17,350
Not even the horses.

3229
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:17,790
Wait.

3230
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:19,230
Horse fell out of the world.

3231
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:20,010
Wait.

3232
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:22,310
People are falling out of the world.

3233
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:27,270
Everybody got Thanos.

3234
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:30,570
Wait.

3235
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:31,990
Why is this door open?

3236
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:32,310
I don't know.

3237
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:34,870
I don't think it was.

3238
02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:36,030
I'm breaking it.

3239
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:37,590
Oh, okay.

3240
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:38,890
Oh my god.

3241
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:40,110
It's so empty.

3242
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:41,130
Bonjour.

3243
02:10:41,130 --> 02:10:41,910
Everybody's dead.

3244
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:45,450
I say bonjour, but no one says bonjour back.

3245
02:10:47,550 --> 02:10:48,090
Bonjour.

3246
02:10:49,210 --> 02:10:49,530
Bonjour.

3247
02:10:51,630 --> 02:10:53,350
It's a ghost village.

3248
02:10:55,090 --> 02:10:55,730
Bonjour.

3249
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:01,430
It's a ghost village.

3250
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:03,150
It's a ghost village.

3251
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:04,450
It's perfect for me.

3252
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:09,830
I'm gonna drown myself here for my sins.

3253
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:13,890
Now I know why they closed the border.

3254
02:11:14,570 --> 02:11:17,530
Oh, did you set the village on fire?

3255
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:22,090
Hide the evidence.

3256
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:26,510
We gotta burn down the village.

3257
02:11:27,990 --> 02:11:30,550
50,000 people used to live here.

3258
02:11:30,690 --> 02:11:32,310
Now it's a ghost town.

3259
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:34,910
Why doesn't it work?

3260
02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:38,110
Wait, I don't think you can burn this part of the village.

3261
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:39,150
Damn.

3262
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:40,970
You know, that's a good way to end.

3263
02:11:41,490 --> 02:11:43,150
You know, I think this is a good way to...

3264
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:45,590
To call it here.

3265
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:47,110
Yeah, I think so.

3266
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:48,830
You know, we should go to Disney World next.

3267
02:11:48,990 --> 02:11:50,270
We won't break Disney World.

3268
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:59,130
We'll do Disney World next time.

3269
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:00,530
Yeah, we'll do Disney World next.

3270
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:02,530
Yeah, we'll do Disney World next time, guys.

3271
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:05,810
What a wonderful Disney adventure, everybody.

3272
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:09,990
We wiped out...

3273
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:12,430
We did what Kingdom Hearts couldn't.

3274
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:17,910
We wiped all darkness away.

3275
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:21,050
We wiped out the Disney World.

3276
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:23,750
I can't believe that everybody is dead.

3277
02:12:24,910 --> 02:12:27,830
No wonder we got kicked out to Agrabah.

3278
02:12:30,910 --> 02:12:34,010
They ported us to Agrabah after what we did.

3279
02:12:35,530 --> 02:12:37,250
They're like, they'll die in the desert.

3280
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:42,110
We did it.

3281
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:43,890
We did it.

3282
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:45,030
We killed them all.

3283
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:46,090
We killed Belle.

3284
02:12:46,190 --> 02:12:46,790
We did it.

3285
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:48,550
We killed Belle and the Beast.

3286
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:50,170
That's right, Gaston.

3287
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:51,310
We did it.

3288
02:12:51,810 --> 02:12:52,430
Killed the Beast.

3289
02:12:52,630 --> 02:12:53,970
Put me in adventurer mode.

3290
02:12:54,130 --> 02:12:56,270
Alright, it's time we do it together.

3291
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:57,270
Yeah.

3292
02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:59,270
Alright, for the sins.

3293
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:00,810
For our sins.

3294
02:13:03,110 --> 02:13:04,850
Remember what we did, man.

3295
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:06,690
I remember.

3296
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:08,050
You remember.

3297
02:13:09,410 --> 02:13:09,670
We should...

3298
02:13:09,670 --> 02:13:10,570
I'll never forget.

3299
02:13:11,370 --> 02:13:12,570
I'm gonna do a flip.

3300
02:13:13,250 --> 02:13:14,470
Do you think we can Tetris?

3301
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:15,170
Do the Tetris?

3302
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:18,770
Wait, can I Tetris even while I fall?

3303
02:13:24,970 --> 02:13:26,570
I think you did it.

3304
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:29,310
I think you did the Tetris even while you fell.

3305
02:13:29,790 --> 02:13:31,630
Wait, you go first.

3306
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,170
Okay, hold on.

3307
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:39,250
I didn't fall very far.

3308
02:13:39,490 --> 02:13:39,870
Me too.

3309
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:41,230
Oh, we should've done it in the void.

3310
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:42,770
You know what?

3311
02:13:42,790 --> 02:13:43,870
We can go to the void.

3312
02:13:43,870 --> 02:13:45,250
Wait, we actually can.

3313
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:46,010
Let's go to the void.

3314
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:47,370
Wait, I'm not dying.

3315
02:13:48,250 --> 02:13:49,910
No, we can only die in the void.

3316
02:13:50,770 --> 02:13:50,990
Okay.

3317
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:52,450
Yeah, I think it's this way.

3318
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:54,790
I think it's this way.

3319
02:13:56,090 --> 02:13:56,950
Yeah, it's this way.

3320
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:06,070
This is how I wanna go.

3321
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:07,890
Via Tetris.

3322
02:14:07,930 --> 02:14:08,970
We're going all the way down.

3323
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:10,750
Wait, is that not...

3324
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:11,550
Where is it?

3325
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:12,810
I think we have to go down to go up.

3326
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:13,930
No, I see it.

3327
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:14,410
I found it.

3328
02:14:15,330 --> 02:14:17,350
Alright, I remember the hole you've dug.

3329
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:19,650
I remember your sins.

3330
02:14:21,530 --> 02:14:24,370
I was just trying to protect the village from Gaston.

3331
02:14:24,910 --> 02:14:27,050
Wait, I wanna go to Gaston's hole.

3332
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:29,230
You go to this hole, I go to Gaston's hole.

3333
02:14:29,590 --> 02:14:31,610
And then, we'll jump at the same time.

3334
02:14:31,610 --> 02:14:33,110
Okay, I believe in us.

3335
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:34,170
Hold on, give me a second.

3336
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:34,910
I gotta run there.

3337
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:37,850
What a way to end it.

3338
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:43,750
Hold on, we saw the horses die.

3339
02:14:43,990 --> 02:14:46,630
It said on the side they died out of the world.

3340
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:47,330
Yeah.

3341
02:14:47,330 --> 02:14:48,810
I guess everybody else did too.

3342
02:14:49,190 --> 02:14:50,150
I think...

3343
02:14:52,210 --> 02:14:53,290
Alright, I'm ready.

3344
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,830
I'm almost there.

3345
02:14:57,190 --> 02:14:58,610
What a way to go.

3346
02:14:59,690 --> 02:15:00,790
I'm almost there.

3347
02:15:01,310 --> 02:15:01,890
I'm waiting.

3348
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:03,410
I'm almost there.

3349
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:04,030
I'm waiting.

3350
02:15:06,010 --> 02:15:06,610
Okay.

3351
02:15:06,910 --> 02:15:07,190
Ready?

3352
02:15:07,190 --> 02:15:07,430
Ready?

3353
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:09,150
3...

3354
02:15:09,150 --> 02:15:10,110
2...

3355
02:15:11,710 --> 02:15:12,390
1...

3356
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:18,990
Wait, what's this?

3357
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:23,610
Do you see the minigame?

3358
02:15:31,970 --> 02:15:32,650
Respawn.

3359
02:15:32,930 --> 02:15:33,530
Respawn.

3360
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:34,610
Wait, wait, wait.

3361
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:35,830
Come to my hole.

3362
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:42,150
I think I found everybody.

3363
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:47,190
Wait, we have to go in creative mode.

3364
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:48,330
We have to go in creative mode.

3365
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:49,050
Okay, okay, okay.

3366
02:15:49,490 --> 02:15:50,890
Wait, are they all...

3367
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:52,530
Are they all in the...

3368
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:55,730
Okay, there.

3369
02:15:55,850 --> 02:15:56,450
I gave you creative.

3370
02:15:56,890 --> 02:15:57,590
Okay, alright.

3371
02:15:57,710 --> 02:15:58,010
Come on.

3372
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:01,150
Oh my god.

3373
02:16:01,310 --> 02:16:01,970
No way.

3374
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:03,670
No way.

3375
02:16:05,030 --> 02:16:05,550
Okay.

3376
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:08,390
Okay, just drop.

3377
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:11,870
Oh my god.

3378
02:16:14,690 --> 02:16:15,990
What is this?

3379
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:20,630
It's a party.

3380
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:29,090
And even... I think it's every...

3381
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:30,130
It's every entity.

3382
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:36,540
Because there's the book from the beginning.

3383
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:38,480
And you have to beat all the entities.

3384
02:16:41,510 --> 02:16:42,310
And there's the team.

3385
02:16:46,470 --> 02:16:48,010
Oh my god.

3386
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:51,390
Oh my god, I went through the portal and I broke in the event.

3387
02:16:51,390 --> 02:16:52,570
Wait, you were in the portal?

3388
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:53,210
Oh my god.

3389
02:16:53,310 --> 02:16:53,770
The portal works.

3390
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:54,690
The portal works.

3391
02:16:55,050 --> 02:16:55,450
Go through the portal.

3392
02:16:55,450 --> 02:16:56,270
Where did you end up?

3393
02:16:56,510 --> 02:16:58,230
It's just back in the town.

3394
02:16:58,730 --> 02:16:59,930
No, I'm in Snow White.

3395
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:11,350
Oh my god.

3396
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:13,710
I went to Snow White.

3397
02:17:15,290 --> 02:17:16,870
Wow, what a great...

3398
02:17:16,870 --> 02:17:18,670
What a way to end the collab.

3399
02:17:20,570 --> 02:17:21,370
Next time...

3400
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:22,110
Why it broke?

3401
02:17:22,730 --> 02:17:25,550
Yeah, we broke the game.

3402
02:17:25,730 --> 02:17:29,170
Everything got jammed up for a year.

3403
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:33,790
Next time we'll go to Disneyland.

3404
02:17:36,690 --> 02:17:38,830
Oh man, that was fun, man.

3405
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:40,810
Yeah, that was fun.

3406
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:42,310
That was fun too.

3407
02:17:42,650 --> 02:17:45,910
I was like, this is where all the Disney characters go when they die.

3408
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:51,950
Don't let Mint and Toki find you.

3409
02:17:57,530 --> 02:17:59,630
You'll be sent to the Shadow Realm every time.

3410
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:01,070
We'll send you to the Shadow Realm.

3411
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:04,790
We'll send you to where the Heartless go.

3412
02:18:10,010 --> 02:18:14,270
Someone super chat is like, I'm gonna tell my kids that this was the real Kingdom Hearts.

3413
02:18:18,630 --> 02:18:20,770
Yeah, this is the real Kingdom Hearts.

3414
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:23,170
This is how you only make one game for Kingdom Hearts.

3415
02:18:26,450 --> 02:18:28,230
We get the job done.

3416
02:18:29,170 --> 02:18:29,650
Yeah.

3417
02:18:29,930 --> 02:18:30,870
Oh my god, GG's.

3418
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:32,010
We really did do it though.

3419
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:33,630
GG's, Mint.

3420
02:18:34,410 --> 02:18:34,890
GG's.

3421
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:37,770
Next time we'll do Disney World and we'll try...

3422
02:18:37,770 --> 02:18:39,270
Yeah, you can ride the rides on Disney World.

3423
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:42,170
Yeah, hurry up and play the games at the rides too.

3424
02:18:42,650 --> 02:18:43,070
Yeah.

3425
02:18:43,170 --> 02:18:43,810
Yeah, yeah.

3426
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:45,490
We didn't explore all the worlds, guys.

3427
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:48,090
There's those like Snow White and Little Mermaid, right?

3428
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:50,970
Oh yeah, there's still Little Mermaid.

3429
02:18:51,270 --> 02:18:52,130
I forgot about that one.

3430
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:52,810
Yeah.

3431
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:55,890
To be fair, we got the fun ones.

3432
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:58,650
I think we did a pretty good job.

3433
02:18:58,770 --> 02:19:02,230
Yeah, who cares about Snow White or Little Mermaid anyway?

3434
02:19:02,310 --> 02:19:03,470
Who cares about them?

3435
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:07,830
The water levels always suck and Snow White is a dumb bitch.

3436
02:19:08,990 --> 02:19:11,710
Damn, what do you have against Snow White?

3437
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:13,430
What did she do to you?

3438
02:19:13,430 --> 02:19:14,750
Her movies are boring.

3439
02:19:16,250 --> 02:19:16,690
Movies?

3440
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:17,790
She has one.

3441
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:22,230
Sorry, the next movie, I can already tell.

3442
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:24,970
Oh, there's a live action.

3443
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:25,970
Yeah, to be fair.

3444
02:19:26,090 --> 02:19:29,050
Did you hear that live action made a lot of movies?

3445
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:30,730
Made a lot of money, sorry.

3446
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:31,390
A lot of money.

3447
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:33,010
More than Sonic.

3448
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:33,530
The crab one?

3449
02:19:33,670 --> 02:19:34,210
Yeah, yeah.

3450
02:19:35,390 --> 02:19:37,310
They made more money than Sonic.

3451
02:19:37,930 --> 02:19:38,370
No!

3452
02:19:39,850 --> 02:19:40,930
I thought you loved that one.

3453
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:43,070
It's only because it's Disney.

3454
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:44,150
That's so true.

3455
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:45,230
That's so true.

3456
02:19:45,430 --> 02:19:45,830
No!

3457
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:46,810
I found the hole.

3458
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:49,250
I found the Gaston hole.

3459
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:53,710
Come see what you teleport to.

3460
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:54,830
Alright, it's like gacha.

3461
02:19:55,070 --> 02:19:56,670
Yeah, it's like a little gacha that we play.

3462
02:19:57,450 --> 02:19:58,430
There it is.

3463
02:19:58,590 --> 02:20:00,630
Alright, where am I gonna go now?

3464
02:20:01,390 --> 02:20:02,670
Where's the evil queen?

3465
02:20:04,710 --> 02:20:06,170
It's not teleporting me.

3466
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:08,910
Oh, I'm in Snow White?

3467
02:20:10,370 --> 02:20:11,330
Am I Snow White?

3468
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:12,610
Oh, I am in Snow White.

3469
02:20:12,610 --> 02:20:13,890
There's the...

3470
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:16,630
There's the birds.

3471
02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:19,630
Oh, I see the dark forest.

3472
02:20:20,950 --> 02:20:22,550
Yeah, there's no evil queen.

3473
02:20:23,190 --> 02:20:25,510
And there's no place where Snow White dies.

3474
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:26,430
Like, what the hell?

3475
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:29,430
I mean, to be fair, there wasn't even a place for Mufasa to die.

3476
02:20:29,510 --> 02:20:30,890
We had to create our own destiny.

3477
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:31,510
No, they had the gorge!

3478
02:20:31,770 --> 02:20:32,710
They had the gorge.

3479
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:34,510
We had to create our own destiny.

3480
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:38,310
I see you, I see you.

3481
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:39,470
I found the queen's castle.

3482
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:41,610
Yeah, but she's not in here.

3483
02:20:41,610 --> 02:20:44,510
She's like somewhere where she's making the potion, you know?

3484
02:20:45,730 --> 02:20:46,750
Oh, the evil area.

3485
02:20:46,750 --> 02:20:48,010
Yeah, yeah, the evil lair.

3486
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:52,090
Should I have like a upper room?

3487
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:53,830
Maybe.

3488
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:55,830
We'll never know.

3489
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:56,990
I'm doing spectator mode.

3490
02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:57,670
Fuck this.

3491
02:20:58,310 --> 02:20:59,730
Game mode, spectator...

3492
02:20:59,730 --> 02:21:00,690
I'm finding you evil queen.

3493
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:01,750
Me too, me too, me too.

3494
02:21:01,890 --> 02:21:02,170
Okay.

3495
02:21:02,710 --> 02:21:04,610
Game mode, spectator...

3496
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:07,410
There we go.

3497
02:21:07,950 --> 02:21:08,350
Thank you.

3498
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:10,730
I'm in the castle.

3499
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:11,650
Okay.

3500
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,870
Where are you?

3501
02:21:12,990 --> 02:21:13,670
Wait, there's a dungeon.

3502
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:14,730
Wait, I found it.

3503
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:15,730
There's a dungeon?

3504
02:21:15,970 --> 02:21:16,310
Yeah.

3505
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:19,490
Is she down here?

3506
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:20,470
No, she's not.

3507
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:21,490
But like...

3508
02:21:21,490 --> 02:21:22,490
How do you get in here?

3509
02:21:22,530 --> 02:21:23,070
I don't know.

3510
02:21:23,210 --> 02:21:24,470
I just zoomed.

3511
02:21:25,390 --> 02:21:25,830
I know.

3512
02:21:26,350 --> 02:21:27,090
There's a dungeon.

3513
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:27,990
Oh, there's a little staircase.

3514
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:29,590
Oh, there is.

3515
02:21:30,250 --> 02:21:31,310
X-ray on...

3516
02:21:31,310 --> 02:21:32,410
Oh, I found her, I found her!

3517
02:21:33,010 --> 02:21:33,610
She's with us?

3518
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:34,850
She's here, she's here, she's here.

3519
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:36,450
Look.

3520
02:21:37,550 --> 02:21:38,590
Oh my...

3521
02:21:38,590 --> 02:21:39,590
Oh my gosh!

3522
02:21:39,810 --> 02:21:40,590
She's with us!

3523
02:21:40,890 --> 02:21:41,530
The mirror!

3524
02:21:41,770 --> 02:21:42,810
Yeah, the mirror.

3525
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:44,350
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

3526
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:46,210
Who's the dumbest of them all?

3527
02:21:47,730 --> 02:21:48,650
He's looking at you.

3528
02:21:50,190 --> 02:21:50,710
Dokibo.

3529
02:21:59,390 --> 02:22:00,490
GG, Smith.

3530
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:01,530
What a fun...

3531
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:02,470
Okay, GG for real.

3532
02:22:02,730 --> 02:22:04,710
Disney adventure that we had.

3533
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:06,710
This was truly an adventure.

3534
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:13,710
Truly an adventure that will tell our children and our children's children and Dragoon's children's children and...

3535
02:22:14,710 --> 02:22:17,130
Yeah, this is the real Disney experience.

3536
02:22:17,130 --> 02:22:18,890
This is the real Disney experience.

3537
02:22:18,890 --> 02:22:20,810
This is the real Kingdom Hearts right here.

3538
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:23,850
Yeah, this is how I remember it actually.

3539
02:22:23,930 --> 02:22:24,610
I know, me too.

3540
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:26,710
A flower forest?

3541
02:22:27,850 --> 02:22:29,070
Where did Snow White die?

3542
02:22:31,710 --> 02:22:32,230
Um...

3543
02:22:32,230 --> 02:22:33,150
She died...

3544
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:34,910
Well, she like eats the apple.

3545
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:37,330
And then I think she falls off the cliff.

3546
02:22:37,670 --> 02:22:39,610
And then she's put in the glass case.

3547
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:41,190
Oh, I found the mines.

3548
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:42,250
Hi-ho!

3549
02:22:42,390 --> 02:22:42,950
Oh my god!

3550
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:44,010
Hi-ho!

3551
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:44,910
Hi-ho!

3552
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:46,510
Where after do we go?

3553
02:22:47,070 --> 02:22:49,090
We work all day and have no pay.

3554
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:49,650
Hi-ho!

3555
02:22:50,230 --> 02:22:50,590
Hi-ho!

3556
02:22:50,610 --> 02:22:51,770
There's words there?

3557
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:52,510
No.

3558
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:56,270
That's how I remember it.

3559
02:22:58,010 --> 02:22:58,910
Wait, they...

3560
02:22:58,910 --> 02:23:01,270
Why don't they use actual Minecraft like...

3561
02:23:02,470 --> 02:23:02,950
Horses.

3562
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:03,570
Where's diamonds?

3563
02:23:04,130 --> 02:23:05,250
Where the fuck is diamonds?

3564
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:07,290
They're not making any money.

3565
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:13,130
I like how the little gemmies in this world look like the thing from The Sims.

3566
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:15,670
Oh my god, there they are.

3567
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:18,150
Oh my god, they're huge!

3568
02:23:19,010 --> 02:23:20,550
I found the dwarves.

3569
02:23:20,650 --> 02:23:23,190
Why are the dwarves as big as Snow White?

3570
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:24,490
Where are they?

3571
02:23:24,850 --> 02:23:25,590
Go to the...

3572
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:26,250
Wait, wait, wait.

3573
02:23:26,270 --> 02:23:27,010
Slash TP.

3574
02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:28,970
Yeah, just TP me.

3575
02:23:29,830 --> 02:23:30,390
There, look.

3576
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:30,850
I see a squirrel.

3577
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:32,910
They're just as big...

3578
02:23:32,910 --> 02:23:35,550
They're just as big as Snow White.

3579
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:36,550
Holy...

3580
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:39,190
Oh my god, the bird's trying to escape out of fear.

3581
02:23:39,630 --> 02:23:40,590
They're like...

3582
02:23:41,130 --> 02:23:41,630
Let me out!

3583
02:23:41,830 --> 02:23:42,230
Let me out!

3584
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:42,770
Let me out!

3585
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:44,590
Wait, that means...

3586
02:23:45,130 --> 02:23:46,950
I was like, why is his nose doing that?

3587
02:23:48,410 --> 02:23:50,850
Oh my god, they have different lengths of noses.

3588
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:53,950
Look, it's not about the size of the nose.

3589
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:55,070
It's how you use it.

3590
02:23:55,770 --> 02:23:57,370
Which one's the real one?

3591
02:23:58,790 --> 02:24:00,450
Wait, he's bigger than you.

3592
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:02,510
Wait, this is the first time he's bigger.

3593
02:24:03,410 --> 02:24:04,310
Oh my god!

3594
02:24:04,750 --> 02:24:06,970
Yeah, why are the dwarves bigger?

3595
02:24:07,850 --> 02:24:09,370
Is it because I'm in the ground?

3596
02:24:09,610 --> 02:24:10,390
No, you're...

3597
02:24:10,390 --> 02:24:10,830
Oh, wait, wait.

3598
02:24:11,330 --> 02:24:13,270
I know, they're still bigger than you.

3599
02:24:13,610 --> 02:24:14,310
Where are you?

3600
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:15,610
I'm here.

3601
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:16,830
I'm on...

3602
02:24:16,830 --> 02:24:17,390
You're invis...

3603
02:24:17,390 --> 02:24:17,890
Oh, wait, wait.

3604
02:24:18,290 --> 02:24:19,290
You're invisible to me.

3605
02:24:20,890 --> 02:24:21,410
Oh, now.

3606
02:24:23,230 --> 02:24:24,390
Are you in the house?

3607
02:24:24,390 --> 02:24:24,850
Yeah.

3608
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:28,290
Oh, well.

3609
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:30,650
The bird just opened the door.

3610
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:31,590
No, it's me.

3611
02:24:33,370 --> 02:24:34,350
Oh, that's you?

3612
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:35,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3613
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:36,890
You're the bird?

3614
02:24:37,190 --> 02:24:39,610
No, no, I opened the door and then the bird came in.

3615
02:24:39,730 --> 02:24:42,270
This one looked like the bird opened it.

3616
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:48,210
I thought you turned into a bird.

3617
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:51,770
Oh my god, Morty, look, I turned into a bird.

3618
02:24:52,010 --> 02:24:52,350
Bird.

3619
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:52,550
I'm Donkey Bird.

3620
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:54,970
I'm Donkey Bird.

3621
02:24:57,050 --> 02:25:00,110
Look, Morty, funniest shit in the world.

3622
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:02,050
I'm Donkey Bird.

3623
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:05,930
Okay, I'm gonna... I guess that's it then.

3624
02:25:07,430 --> 02:25:07,910
GG.

3625
02:25:08,270 --> 02:25:09,050
GG's, man.

3626
02:25:09,230 --> 02:25:10,230
Oh, great time.

3627
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:13,810
Next time, let's do this again soon and go to Disney World.

3628
02:25:13,990 --> 02:25:14,950
And go to actual Disney World.

3629
02:25:14,950 --> 02:25:17,390
Yeah, and then let's not destroy Disney World.

3630
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:19,190
I mean, we could.

3631
02:25:19,210 --> 02:25:20,650
We could destroy it.

3632
02:25:20,650 --> 02:25:23,690
You know, at the end, when the fireworks go off, we just...

3633
02:25:24,590 --> 02:25:30,690
When the fireworks are about to go off, and then put a lot of TNT everywhere.

3634
02:25:34,530 --> 02:25:38,170
If we go underground, you think we'll see Walt Disney frozen?

3635
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:44,430
Oh my god, you're right, we'll see Walt Disney frozen in a cryogenic chamber.

3636
02:25:44,990 --> 02:25:47,870
We'll find Walt Disney's cryogenic chamber.

3637
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:55,250
Yeah.

3638
02:25:55,250 --> 02:25:55,830
GG's, man.

3639
02:25:56,210 --> 02:25:56,730
GG's.

3640
02:25:56,810 --> 02:25:58,090
I'll see you next week.

3641
02:25:58,590 --> 02:25:58,730
Yeah.

3642
02:25:59,310 --> 02:25:59,970
Next week?

3643
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:01,010
Don't you remember?

3644
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:02,150
Oh yeah, that's right.

3645
02:26:02,210 --> 02:26:03,030
Yeah, surprise.

3646
02:26:03,430 --> 02:26:05,710
Next week we have another collab.

3647
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:06,610
Another collab.

3648
02:26:06,990 --> 02:26:08,350
With the Sloppy Sisters.

3649
02:26:10,210 --> 02:26:12,750
So see you next week, man.

3650
02:26:13,310 --> 02:26:14,290
Okay, see you next week.

3651
02:26:14,850 --> 02:26:15,810
Bye bye, GG's.

3652
02:26:16,610 --> 02:26:17,650
Bye bye, GG's.

3653
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:21,800

3654
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:22,160
Hey.

3655
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:23,720
Are you gonna go talk to your chat?

3656
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:24,600
I'm still on screen.

3657
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:26,620
Oh, just really fast.

3658
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:27,580
Just gonna say bye.

3659
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:28,460
Okay.

3660
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:29,860
Oh, you're gonna talk to your chat?

02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:33,440
GG's, bye bye.

3665

Bye bye.

3666
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:38,720
Oh my god, that was fun.

3667
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:39,800
I had a great time.

3668
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:42,680
These Minecraft DLC's are so funny.

3669
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:58,980
But I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching Mint and I explore the Disney World.

3670
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:07,400
Us snapping the... snapping the entire world's existence gun.

3671
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:11,860
There you go.

3672
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:12,660
Alright.

3673
02:27:14,120 --> 02:27:15,580
Oh wait, there's Dopey.

3674
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:23,020
But we hope you all had a great time, everybody.

3675
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:24,740
It was so much fun.

3676
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:26,200
It was always fun playing with Mint.

3677
02:27:26,300 --> 02:27:28,020
So I had a great time just fucking around.

3678
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:29,540
But yeah, everybody.

3679
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:31,700
I hope you guys have a great time today.

3680
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:34,640
Tomorrow it's Doki and Berto's birthday!

3681
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:36,120

3682
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:38,080

Anyway guys, as always, everybody.

Stay hydrated.

3686
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:47,520
Posture check.

3687
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,140
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3688
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:52,980
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3689
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:54,920
Cause you deserve it.

3690
02:27:55,340 --> 02:27:56,600

3691
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:57,740
